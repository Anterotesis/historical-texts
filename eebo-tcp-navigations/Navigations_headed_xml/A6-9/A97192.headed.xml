<HEAD>A Declaration of the furious Out-rages of FRANCE, with the slaughter of the Admirall.</HEAD>
<P>IT were to be wished that the memory of fresh slaughters, and of that butcherly murthering that hath lately been committed in a manner in all the Towns of <HI>France,</HI> were utterly put out of the minds of men: For so great dishonour, and so great infamy hath thereby stayned the whole French Nation, that the most part of them are now ashamed of their own Country, defiled with two most filthy spots, false-hood and cruelty; of the which, whether hath been the greater it is hard to say. But forasmuch as there flie every where abroad pamphlets written by flatterers of the Court, and men corruptly hired for reward, which do most shamefully set out things fay∣ned and falsly imagined, instead of truth, I thought my self bound to do this service to posterity, to put the matter in writing as it was truely done indeed, being wel enabled to have knowledge thereof, both by mine own calamity, and by those that with their own eyes beheld a great part of the same slaughter.</P>
<P>In the yeer of our Lord, 1561, when there seemed to be some perill of troubles to arise by reason of the multitude of such as embraced the Religion (which they call reformed (for before that time the usuall manner of punishing such as durst professe that Religion, was, besides losse and forfeiture of all their goods to the Kings use, to burn their bodies) at the request of the great Lords and Nobility, there was holden an Assembly of the Estates, in the Kings house at Saint <HI>Germains</HI> in <HI>Lay,</HI> neer to the Town of <HI>Paris;</HI> at which Assembly, in presence, and with the Royall Assent of King <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, which now raigneth, it was decreed, That from thenceforth it should not be prejudiciall to any man to professe the said Religion, And that it should be lawfull for them to have publique meetings and preachings for the exercise thereof, but in the suburbs of Towns only.</P>
<P>At this assembly, <HI>Francis</HI> Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> being descended of the House of <HI>Lorain,</HI> and at that time grand Master of the Kings Houshold, was not present. But when he was in∣formed of this Decree, he boyled with incredible sorrow and anger, and within few dayes after, at a little Town in <HI>Campagne,</HI> called <HI>Vassey,</HI> while the professors of the said Reli∣gion were there at a Sermon, he, accompanied with a Band of Souldiers, set upon them, and slew men and women to the number of two hundred.</P>
<P>There was among these of the Religion (for so hereafter, according to the usuall phrase of the French tongue we intend to call them) <HI>Lewes</HI> of <HI>Burbon,</HI> of the Blood royal, common∣ly called the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> after the name of a certain Town, a man of great power, by reason of his kindred to the King. Therefore when the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> most vehe, mently strived against that Law, and as much as in him lay did utterly overthrow it, and troubled the common quiet thereby established, <HI>Gasper de Coligni,</HI> Admirall of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Francis d' Andelot</HI> his brother, Captain of the <HI>Fantarie,</HI> and other Princes, Noble∣men, and Gentlemen of the same Religion, came daily by heaps to the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> to complain of the outragious boldnesse, and untemperate violence of the Duke of <HI>Guise.</HI></P>
<P>At that time <HI>Catherine de Medices,</HI> Pope <HI>Clements</HI> brothers daughter, and mother of
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> King <HI>Charles,</HI> born in <HI>Florence,</HI> a City of <HI>Italy,</HI> had the governance of the Realm in the Kings Minority. For though by the Law of <HI>France,</HI> neither the Inheritance, nor the Ad∣ministration of the Realm is granted to women, yet through the cowardly negligence of <HI>Anthony</HI> King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> the said <HI>Katherine de Medices,</HI> the Kings mother, against the custome of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Realm, was joyned with him in that Office of protectorship. She fear∣ing the presumption and fierce pride of the <HI>Guisans,</HI> wrote to the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with her own Hand: which Letters are yet remaining, and at the Assembly of the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> at <HI>Franchford,</HI> holden under <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Emperour, were produced, and open∣ly read about ten yeers past; wherein she earnestly besought him, in so great hardnesse and distresse, not to forsake her, but to account both the mother and the children, that is, both h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r self and the King, and the Kings B ethren, committed to his faith and naturall kindenesse, and that he should with all speed provide for their common safety: assuring him, That she would so imprint in the Kings minde his travell taken in that behalf, that he should never be loser by it.</P>
<P>Within few dayes after, the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> well knowing how great authority the name of the King would carry in <HI>France;</HI> and to the intent that he would not seem to at∣tempt any thing rather of his own head, than the priuity of the King; and hauing attain∣ed fit partners to joyn with him in these enterprises, he got the King into his power. Which thing known abroad, and many hard encombrances thereupon suddenly rising, and a great part of the Nobility of <HI>France</HI> marvellously troubled with it, the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> by advice of his friends, thought it best to take certain Towns, and furnish them with garisons; which was the beginning of the first civill warre. For the prince of <HI>Conde</HI> alleaged the cause of his taking armour, to be the defence of the Kings Edict, wherein consisted the safety of the Common-weal, and that it could not be repealed without most assured undoing of the Nation of <HI>France,</HI> and destruction of the Nobility, by reason of the exceeding great multitude of those that dayly joyned themselves to that Religion. Of which number such as being of Noble Birth, were in power, dignity, wealth, and credit above the rest, thought it not meet for them to suffer the punishments and cruelty accustomed to be extended upon the professors thereof, beside that, they held them discon∣tented, that the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> a new-come stranger, translated from the Forrests of <HI>Lo∣rain</HI> into France, did take upon him in <HI>France</HI> so great courage, and so high dominion and power. Thereto was added the Queen-mothers singular care (as was reported) for con∣servation of peace, and repressing the rage of the <HI>Guisans.</HI> Upon which opinion it is cer∣tain, That above twenty thousand men having regard onely to the Queens inclination, joyned themselves to the side of those of the Religion, and to the defence of their profes∣sion, which at that time had besieged the force of the Kings power.</P>
<P>After certain Battels, and many losses on both parts, and the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> slain, with∣in a yeer peace was made, with this condition, That they of the Religion should have free Liberty thereof, and should have assemblies and preachings for the exercise of the same in certain places.</P>
<P>This peace continued in force, but not in all places, during five yeers: for in the most Towns and Jurisdictions, the Officers that were affectionate to the Romish side, whom they commonly call Catholikes, did all the displeasures they could to those of the Re∣ligion. Therefore, when <HI>Ferdinando Alvares de Toledo,</HI> commonly called Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/> was leading an Army not farre from the frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> against those of the <HI>Low-Countrey</HI> which embraced the reformed Religion, against the will of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Queen-mother caused to be leavyed and brought into <HI>France</HI> six thousand <HI>Switzers</HI> for a defence, as she caused it to be bruted; but as the successe hath proved, for this intent, That the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Admirall, and other Noble men of the Reli∣gion, if they escaped the Treasons prepared for them, and listed to defend themselves by fo ce, and try it by Battell, might be suddenly oppressed ere they were provided. For the Courtiers which then had the managing of these matters, did not at that time well trust the Souldiers of <HI>France.</HI> Many thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pertayning to the course of that time, and the renewing of the War, must here for haste to our present purpose be necessarily omitted.</P>
<P>When the War had endured about six months, peace was made with the same Condi∣tions that we have above rehearsed, That all men should have free liberty to follow and professe the Religion reformed. For this was ever one and the last Condition upon all the Wars. But within few dayes or months after, it was plainly understood, that the same peace was full of guile and treason, and finally, That it was no peace, but most cru∣ell Warre, cloaked under the name of Peace. For forthwith all those Towns which they of the Religion had yeelded up, were possessed and strengthened with Garrisons of Souldiers of the contrary side, saving onely one Town on the Sea-coast in the parts of <HI>Xantoigne</HI> commonly called <HI>Rochell.</HI> For the men of that Town about two hun∣dred yeers past, had yeelded themselves to the Kings Power and Allegiance, with this Condition, That they should never be constrayned against their will to receive any Gar∣rison Souldiers.</P>
<P>Also the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the Admirall were advertised, That there was Treason again prepared to entrap them by <HI>Tavagnes,</HI> a man given to murther and mischief, which had lately been made Marshall of <HI>France,</HI> and that if they did not speedily avoid the same, it should shortly come to passe, that they should be deceived and taken by him, and delivered up to the cruelty of their adversaries.</P>
<P>Upon the receit of these advertisements, they immediatly make haste to <HI>Rochell,</HI> car∣rying with them their wives and young children, which was the beginning of the third Civill Warre, the most sharp and miserable of all the rest.</P>
<P>There was at that time in the Court, <HI>Charles</HI> Cardinall of <HI>Lorain,</HI> brother to the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> which (as is above said) was slain in the first War; one accounted most subtill and crafty of all the rest, but of a terrible, cruell, and troubelsome disposition, so as he was thought intollerable even at <HI>Rome</HI> it self. This man, they of the reformed Re∣ligion reported to be the most sharp and hatefull enemy of their profession, and him they abhorred above all other for the cruelty of his nature, and named him the fire-brand of all civill flames. He at the beginning of the third Civill Warre, perswaded the King to publish an Edict, That no man professe any Religion but the Romish or Popish, and that whosoever would embrace any other, should be counted as Traytors. In that same Edict Printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> the sentence was expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly contained, and for the strangenesse of the matter, and for that it stained the Kings name with the most dishonourable spot of perjury, and breach of Faith, it was in other impressions afterward omitted. And it was further then declared, That albeit the King had in many Edicts before that time permitted the freedome of Religion, yet his meaning ever was to
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> retain and cause to be retained of all men, the onely Romish or popish Religion within his Realm.</P>
<P>After many overthrows on both parties given and received, whereas the end of this third War was thought likely to he harder, by reason of the breach of Faith in the yeers before, and on the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her side the state of the Realm, by reason of the waste that the Ci∣ties were brought unto, and the extreme poverty of the mean people, and husband∣men, old require some Treaty of Composition, the King sent Messengers to the Admi∣rall, to signifie unto him in the Kings name, That the King h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself had at length found out a most sure way of peace and concord, namely, That the Armies of both parties joyned together, should go into the <HI>Low Countrey</HI> against the Duke of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>va,</HI> which had been the author of the late calamities in <HI>France.</HI> He signifieth further, That he had great causes of quarrels against the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and this principally, That he had invaded and held by force, suddenly sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying all the Souldiers there, an Island of the new-found world, called <HI>Florida,</HI> which had been taken by the French King, and kept under his Do∣minion; and likewise the Marquesdom of <HI>Finall,</HI> the inhabitants whereof had but a little time before yeelded th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mselves to the Kings subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction and allegiance. He said that the most stedfast band of concord should be that forraign War, and that there could no o∣ther better mean be devised to drown the memory of the former dissentions in eternall forgetfulnesse.</P>
<P>To the performance whereof, he said it was a matter of most apt opportunity, that <HI>Lodovic</HI> Count of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> Brother to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had been now two yeers in the Admirals Camp, to whom the Admirall gave principall credit in all things, and that by him and his fellows of the <HI>Low Countrey,</HI> and other whom he understood to favour his part, it might easily be brought to passe that certain Cities might be surprised, and thereby great advantage be attained to the atchieving of the War.</P>
<P>The Admirall hearing these things was marvellously troubled. For albeit he doubt∣ed not of the Kings fidelity, yet therewithall many things fell into his minde to be consi∣dered: as the power of the Cardinall, and the rest of the <HI>Guisans,</HI> who were well known to have been at all times most affectionate to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> For the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> had left a son, a very young man, called <HI>Henry,</HI> to whom the Queen had given all the Of∣fices and places of honour that his father had born before, being unfit thereto by age, and against the ancient Laws and Customes, and also through the trayterous infidelity of certain of the Kings Councellors, whom she knew for their affection to popish Re∣ligion, to be most addicted to the Spanish King, and that divers of them had great yeer∣ly pensions of him, and did disclose unto him the affairs of the Realm. He remembred how hereby it came to passe, That the same Kings Ambassadour (which among strange Nations seemed utterly incredible) was admitted into the privy Councell of <HI>France;</HI> and that one <HI>Biragio</HI> a <HI>Lumbard,</HI> and (as it is reported) a Traytor to his own Countrey, otherwise altogether unlearned, and specially ignorant of the Civill Law, was yet for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subtilty of his wit advanced to so great honour, that he executed the Chanc llors Office, <HI>Michael Hospitall</HI> being displaced, a man known to be such a one, as there was not in all degrees of men, any eithermore wise, or more learned, or more zea∣lously loving his Countrey. Herewithall he considered the slanderous cavillations of
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> his adversaries, to whom hereby might seem an occasion given, as if the Admirall were of a troublesome nature, and could not abide any quietnesse, nor could long rest at home without some tumultuous stirre. Hereunto the messengers replyed as they were able, and therewithall alleadged this cause of so sudden hatred against the Spanish King, that one <HI>Albenie,</HI> late returned out of <HI>Spain,</HI> had informed the King, and the Queen-mother for certain, That King <HI>Philip</HI> a few months before, had poysoned his wife the French Kings sister, and had spred many rumours of her thorowout all <HI>Spain,</HI> such as for the honour of many persons, are meet not to be disclosed. But nothing moved the Admirall so much as the cheerfull earnestnesse of <HI>Lodovic</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> who as soon as he was advertised of that purpose of the Kings, omitted nothing that he thought might serve to encourage the Admirall thereunto.</P>
<P>The Admirall perswaded hereby, nothing fearing the infidelity of those of the Court, gave his minde to hearken to Composition. And so was the third Civill War ended, and the peace concluded with the same Conditions that were before, That every man should have free liberty to use and professe the Religion.</P>
<P>Within few months after this, divers Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> that favoured the Religi∣on reformed, and amongst those the three Electors, the Palsegrave, the Duke of <HI>Saxo∣ny,</HI> and the Marquesse of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> sent their Ambassadours into <HI>France,</HI> to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King, to gratulate unto him for the new reconciliation of his subjects. And because they accounted it greatly to behoove themselves, that the same concord should remain stedfast, and of long continuance, they promised, That if any would for that cause pro∣cure trouble, or make Warre upon him either within his own Dominions, or without, they and their followers should be ready to defend him. To this Ambassage the King first by words, and afterwards by a book, subscribed with his own hand, answered, and gave his Faith, That he would for ever most sacredly and faithfully observe his Edict of Pacification.</P>
<P>Hereby so much the more willingly the Admirall suffered himself to be drawn to the said purposes for the <HI>Low-Countrey,</HI> although oftentimes calling to minde the nature of the Queenmother, he used to say to divers, and especially to <HI>Theligny,</HI> to whom he after∣ward married his daughter, That he greatly suspected the rolling wit of that woman. For (said he) so soon as she hath brought us into that preparation against the <HI>Low-Coun∣trey,</HI> she will leave us in the midst.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse, the Count of <HI>Nassaw</HI> writeth to his brother, and they conferring their advices together, send Messengers to the King, That if it please him to deal with the matter of the <HI>Low-Countrey;</HI> they will shortly so do, that he shall by their many and great services, well perceive their affection and devotion toward him. The King wri∣teth again to them in most loving tearms, saying, That their Message most highly plea∣sed him, and he gave to them both his hearty thanks.</P>
<P>About the same time <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperour, pitying the state of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (as he said) treated by his Ambassadours with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had in manner obtained that the Prince should have all his goods restored unto him; but with this C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndition, That he should have no house within the Territory of the <HI>Low Country;</HI> but setling his residence and dwelling elsewhere, he should freely enjoy all his Reve∣nues. Which matter being reported to the French King, he immediately sent Messen∣gers
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> willing him to look for nothing by that dealing of the Emperour, saying that it was but a fraud and guilfull device, intended for this purpose, Only to break up his leavying of Souldiers that he had begun in <HI>Germany,</HI> and assuring him, That if he would credit and follow him, he would give him ayd sufficient to reco∣ver his Estate.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> perswaded by these promises of King <HI>Charles,</HI> continued his Mustering, and determined a while to bear the charges, though they were heavy to him, while such things as were necessary for the War were in preparing. In the mean time <HI>Lodovic,</HI> in disguised apparell, went to <HI>Paris</HI> to the King, Forasmuch as the season of the yeer by this time seemed not commodious to leavy an Army, for the winter was at hand, by assent they deferred the matter till the next Summer.</P>
<P>These things thus hanging, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his Captains by Sea, did oftentimes set upon the Spaniards and Portugalls, and such Ships as they took, they brought into the Haven of <HI>Rochell,</HI> which then was in the power of the Prince of <HI>Condees</HI> part; and there they openly uttered and sold their prizes to the men of the Town, and other Mer∣chants of <HI>France,</HI> whereupon the Ambassadour of <HI>Spain</HI> made often complaints to the Kings Privy Councell.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as they thought it very available to this enterprise, that <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Queen of <HI>England</HI> might be brought into league with them, the King committed the dealing in that matter to the Admirall. For, a few months before, the King had with most sweet alluring Letters, gotten him to the Court, where he was most honourably enter∣tained: and to take from him all occasion of distrust upon his adversaries, or of other∣wise suspecting of the Kings, or Queen-mothers affection to him, first, all the <HI>Guisans</HI> of a set purpose departed the Court. Then the King gave the Admirall free liberty to take with him such company, and with what furniture he would: and because it was thought that he had more confidence in the Marshall Cosse, then in the rest, therefore the King commanded the said Marshall to be ever at hand with the Admirall, and to as∣sist him in the Kings name, if any need were.</P>
<P>The matter of the league with <HI>England,</HI> the Admirall so diligently and industriously handled, that within short space after, by the Ambassadours assent, and by faith given and received, and Oaths solemnly taken on both parts, it was confirmed. Concerning the procurement of other Leagues and Amities, such as might seem to further the enter∣prise of the <HI>Low Countrey,</HI> the Admirall also travelled in the Kings name, and by his commandment, and had in a manner brought all these things to an end. And of all those Leagues, the first and principall condition was, That the liberty of Religion should continue, and that the King should most diligently and sincerely observe this Edict of Pacification.</P>
<P>Though these things seemed to be handled secretly, yet by the Letters both of <HI>Biragio</HI> the Vice-chancellor, of whom we made mention before, and of <HI>Morvil∣liers,</HI> whom from his hypocriticall leannesse children commonly called the Chimera or bugge of the Court, and by advertisements of Cardinall <HI>de Pelve,</HI> a man most fit, either to invent or execute any Treason, they were carryed to the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> who by advice of his Cardinalls, sent by and by one of their number, called <HI>Alexandrine,</HI> in the midst of most sharp Winter into <HI>France,</HI> with these

<P>The Cardinall <HI>Alexandrine</HI> was honourably received in the Court, but yet dism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed without atchieving his purpose. For so was it bruted among the People, and comm nly beleeved throughout <HI>France:</HI> Albeit, he himself secretly seemed to return very mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and cheerfull to the Pope; and as it is reported, did sometime say, That he received such answer of the King as was needfull, not to be published, And that the King and Queen-Mother had largely satisfied him.</P>
<P>Forasmuch, As it was thought a matter greatly availing to the enterprise of the Low-Countrey, to send certain Ships into the English Seas; That if any ayde should be sent into the Low. Countrey to the Duke of <HI>Alv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> out of <HI>Spain,</HI> it might so be stopped, <HI>Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzi</HI> and the <HI>Baron de la Guarde</HI> were appointed for that purpose, to whom the King gave in Commandment to Rigge forth certain Ships of <HI>Burdeaux</HI> and <HI>Rochell,</HI> well Armed and well appointed, and to provide with all speed all things needfull for those Ships. The Ambassador of <HI>Spain</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mewhat moved with this preparation, made divers complaints to the Kings Counsell, on the behalf of the King his Master, and yet never received any other Answer, But that the King thought it not likely, and that he would send Commissio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers to <HI>Burdeaux</HI> and to <HI>Rochell,</HI> with Letters and Commandment, that there should be no preparation made to the Sea, and if any had been made, it should be enquired of. What instructions were secretly and closely under hand given to these two Captains of that Navy, we do not certainly know. But this no man can doubt of, But that they had Commission to distresse all such Ships, wherein any Spanish Souldiers should be tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rted into the Low-Countrey, And that all this preparation to the Sea, was ordained against the Spainsh King, and the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI></P>
<P>And moreover, That the Admirall at the same time, received Commandment from the King, to send Espialls into <HI>Peru,</HI> an Iland of the new found World, most plentifull of Gold above all the other, now being in the Spaniards Dominion, to learn if there were any good enterprise to be attempted, or atchieved for the getting of it. Which matter was committed to a certain Gentleman, one of the Admiralls train, who went thither accompanied with a certain Portingall, a man most skilfull of those Navigations, whom the Admirall had joyned with him by the Kings Commandment, and is not yet returned.</P>
<P>Now it cannot be expressed how many, and how great tokens of most loving minde t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e King at that time shewed to the Admirall, and to the County <HI>Rochfaucault,</HI> and to <HI>Theligny,</HI> and to the rest of the chief Noblemen of the Religion. First, All such things as in the former warres had been taken away in the Towns, Ferms, and Castles of the Admirall and <HI>d'Andelot,</HI> the King caused to be sought out and restored. If there were any other whom the King understood to be beloved and esteemed of the Admirall, or to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained any speciall honour in the said late warres, those he liberally benefited and rewarded. To the Admirall himself he commanded one day to be given a hundred thousand pounds of his own treasure, in recompence of his former losses. W en his
<PB N="10" REF="6"/> Brother the Cardinall <HI>Cbastillion,</HI> endowed with many great and wealthy benefices, was departed his life, the King gave him the fruits of one whole yeer. Also the King wrote to <HI>Pbilibert</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> That he should do him a most acceptable pleasure, if he did not onely de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l more gently with those that in the former warres had ayded those of the Religion, but also would use clemency and mildenesse toward all other that professed the same Religion within His Dominions.</P>
<P>And for that there was old enmity between the Guisians and the Admirall, whereby it was to be doubted, that perillous contentions would arise in the Realm of <HI>France,</HI> the King willed it to be signified to them both in His Name, That they should for His sake, and the Common-weals, give over those displeasures, and He prescribed them a certain form of Reconciliation and Agreement; the same whereof, the Foundations had been laid almost six yeers before in the Town of <HI>Molins,</HI> where the King calling to him the greatest estates of His Realm, after consultation and deliberation had upon the mat∣ter, pronounced the Admirall not guilty of the death of the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> wherewith he was charged by the young Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> and his Kinsmen: And so the King by the advise of His Counsell had ended that controversie.</P>
<P>Furthermore, The Cardinall of <HI>Lorain</HI> (who as we have said, was the very forger of all the former warres) to take away all jealousie of new practises, was departed to <HI>Rome,</HI> and took with him his familiar friend the late created Cardinall <HI>Pelvey,</HI> one reputed a most subtill and crafty person, under pretence of going to the election of a new Pope in place of the old Pope then lately deceased.</P>
<P>But there was none greater, and more assured token of publike peace and quietnesse then this, That the King purposed to give His Sister <HI>Margaret</HI> in marriage to the Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> the Sonne of the Queen of <HI>Navarre;</HI> which Prince had in the last warre defend∣ed the cause of the Religion, and been Soveraign of their Army. Which marriage the King declared, That it should be the most streight bond of civill Concord, and the most assured testimony of His good will to those of the Religion.</P>
<P>Yea, and also because it was alleaged, That the said Prince <HI>Henry</HI> was restrained in conscience, so as he might not marry the Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> being of a contrary Religion, a Catholike, and given to the Rites of the Romish Church, the King for answer said, That He would discharge her of the Popes Laws; And notwithstanding, the crying out of all His Courtiers to the contrary, He permitted him, That without all Ceremonies, in the Porch of the great Church of <HI>Paris,</HI> the marriage should be celebrate in such a form, as the Ministers of the reformed Church misliked not.</P>
<P>Which thing being by report and Letters, spread through the World, It cannot be ex∣pressed how much it made the hearts of those of the Religion, assured, and out of care, and how it cast out all fear and jealousies out of their minds, what a confidence it brought them of the Kings good will towards them. Finally, How much it rejoyced forraign Princes and States, that favoured the same Religion. But the Admirals minde was much more stablished by a Letter, which about the same time <HI>Theligny</HI> brought him with the Kings own Hand and sealed, wherein was contained, That whatsoever the Admirall should do for the matter of the intended warre of the Low-Country, the King would allow and ratifie the same, as done by his own Commandment. About that time <HI>Lodo∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> with the Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> a Lady most zealously affected to the
<PB N="11" REF="6"/> Religion, came to the French Court. The league was made between King <HI>Charles</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Articles thereof put in writing. The marriage was ap∣pointed to be holden in the Town of <HI>Paris.</HI> For which cause the Queen of <HI>Navarre,</HI> during those few dayes, repaired thither, to provide things for the solemnity of the Wedding. For the same cause, the King sent to the Admirall one <HI>Cavaignes,</HI> a man of an excellent sharp wit, whom for the Admiralls sake, the King had advanced to great honour, requiring the Admirall to go before to <HI>Paris,</HI> as well for the said preparation, as also for the matter of the warre of the Low-Country, promising, that he himself would within few dayes follow after him; Assuring him, that there was now no cause for him to feare the threatnings and mad outrages of the Parisians. For in asmuch as the same towne is above all other given to superstitions and is with seditious preachings of Monks and Friers dayly enflamed to cruelty, it is hard to expresse how bitterly they hated the Admirall and the professors of that Religion. Whereto was added a grief of their minde conceived certain dayes before, by reason of a certain stone crosse gilted and built afte the manner of a spire steeple, commonly called Gastignes crosse, which the Admirall with great earnest sute obtained of the King to be overthrown: for he allea∣ged, that being erected in the midst of the rage of the civill warre, as it were in triumph to the reproach of one of the Religion, it was a monument of civill dissention, and so a matter offensive to peace and concord.</P>
<P>The King well knowing this deadly hate of the Parisians to the Admirall, wrote his letters to Marc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the provost of the marchants (which is the highest dignity in <HI>Paris</HI>) with sharp threatnings if there should be raised any stirre or trouble by reason of the Admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als coming. To the same effect, also the Duke of <HI>Anjow</HI> the Kings Brother, and the Queen-Mother wrote to the same Marcell and the rest of the Magistrates of <HI>Paris,</HI> So that now there seemed utterly no occasion left for the Admirall, to fear or distrust. And within few dayes after, the King sent <HI>Briquemault</HI> a man of g eat vertue and esti∣mation, to the Admirall, with the same instructions, saying, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the matter of the Low-Countrey could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t well be dealt in without his presence.</P>
<P>The Admirall perswaded by thus many means, and filled with good h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe and courage, determined to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> where so soon as he was arrived, and had been honourably and lovingly entertained of the King and His Brethen, and the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en-Mother, and consulta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion entred among them, about the preparation for the Low-Countrey, he de∣clared to the King at large, how the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> was in levying of great power, and prepa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing an Army, and that if the King should dissemble his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urpose, it would come to pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that many hereby would shew themselves slower and sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cker to the enterprise, and that now were offered great means to do good, which if he let slip, he should not so easily recover the like again hereafter. And therefore it was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st to take the advantage of this opportunity.</P>
<P>A few dayes before, <HI>Lodovick</HI> of <HI>Nassaw</HI> went secretly into the Frontie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Low-Countrey, and took wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h him as Partners of his journey and Privy to His Counsell, three Frenchmen of great credit with the Admirall, namely <HI>Saucourt, la Nove,</HI> and <HI>Genlis,</HI> to whom the King had given in charge to see if they could by any means attempt and poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse any Towns bordering upon his Realm. They gathering divers other Gen∣tlemen into their company, went speedily into the Low-Countrey, the Admirall not
<PB N="12" REF="7"/> knowing of it. Who as soon as he understood of their going thither, wrote unto them, th t he much marvelled what they meant, saying, that he well knew there could be no power g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tten ready before forty dayes end, and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y should be well advised to do nothing rashly, nor to overthrow with haste their devices that seemed not ripe to be executed.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Nassaw</HI> inflamed with the sight and desire of his Countrey, and fear∣ing the mutablenesse of the King, did first at the sudden set upon <HI>Valentiennes,</HI> but be∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g repulsed by the Spanish Souldiers that were in Garrison in the Castle, he hastily de∣parted to <HI>Montz,</HI> and took the Town, being a place very strong by nature and well furnished with all things necessary for the warre. Which thing being by report and messengers spread abroad in the Low Countrey, and carried into <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> both encouraged all them of the Religion with great hope, and also seemed to have now plainly and openly deciphred and disclosed the minde of the French King. Moreover, <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nlis</HI> returning to <HI>Paris,</HI> when he had made report to the King of all the matter as it had proceeded, easily obtained of him, that by his assent he might leavy certain Bands of footm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and horsemen of <HI>France,</HI> and carry them to succour <HI>Montz.</HI> But by the way when he was entred into the Bounds of the Low-Country, having with him to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber of four thousand footmen, and about four hundred horsemen, they were beset by the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and the most part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istressed; which thing was well known to have been wrought by the means of the <HI>Guisians,</HI> which by daily Messages and Let∣ters, advertised the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> of their purposes and preparation. Which falsehood of theirs, many most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffectionate to the Romish Religion, were highly offended with, because a great number addicted to the same Romish Religion were in that company.</P>
<P>With this losse, and with the rescue of the Town of <HI>Valentiennes,</HI> the King seemed to be much troubled for he feared least h s Counsells being disclosed to the Spanish King, would at length breed some cause of quarrell and warre. Howb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, when he began to remember, that a great part of his secrets was already revealed to the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> he oftentimes resolv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to utter his minde plainly, and to make open warre. But he was withdrawn from that purp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se by certain men, which the Admirall had long before con∣ceived, that they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld so do. Howbeit, he gave the Admirall liberty to send what∣soever he thought meet to further the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> his enterprise, and as great supply eith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of footmen or horsemen as he could to the Army, which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had levyed in <HI>Germany.</HI> When the Admirall for that cause had made request, that he might levy thir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y tro pes of horsemen, and as many Ensignes of footmen, he easily obtained it.</P>
<P>For the entertainment of these footmen it behoved to have money; wherefore at the request of the Admirall, the King called for his Treasurer, and commanded him to deli∣ver to the Admirall so much money as the Admirall should think meet, and charged him, that h sh uld not in any wise after the usuall manner of the accompts of Finances, write the causes of the receipt, but only set it down in this forme: This summe of money was paid to the Admirall such a day by the Kings commandment, for certain cause<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which the King h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th commanded not to be written: and to this warrant the King subscribed with his own hand.</P>
<P>Also the King wrote to <HI>Monducet,</HI> his Ambassador in the Low-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untrey, to travell a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly as he could, for their deliverance, that were taken at the overthrow of
<PB N="13" REF="7"/> <HI>Genlis,</HI> which commandment it is said that <HI>Monducet</HI> did most faithfully and diligently execute.</P>
<P>Not long before this, <HI>Joan</HI> Queen of <HI>Navarre</HI> above mentioned, died in the Court at <HI>Paris</HI> of a sudden sicknesse, being about the age of forty and three yeers, where, as the suspition was great that she died of poys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and her body was for that cause open∣ed by the Physitians, there were tokens of poyson espyed. But shortly after, by the detection of one <HI>A. P.</HI> it hath been found that she was poysoned with a venomed smell of a pair of perfumed Gloves, dressed by one <HI>Renat,</HI> the Kings Apothecary, an Italian, that hath a Shop at <HI>Paris</HI> upon S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Michaels</HI> Bridge, neer unto the Pallace; which could not be espyed by the Physitians, which did not open the head, nor looked into the Brain. It is well known that the same man about certain yeers past, for the same intent, gave to <HI>Lewes</HI> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince of <HI>Conde</HI> a poysoned Pomander, which the Prince left with one <HI>le G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osse</HI> his Chirurgion: <HI>le Grosse</HI> delighted with the same, was by little and little poy∣soned therewith, and so swelled, that he hardly escaped with his life.</P>
<P>By her death, the kingdom came to Prince <HI>Henry</HI> her son, to whom, as is above said, the Kings sister was promised and contracted.</P>
<P>Things being, as it seemed thorowout all <HI>France,</HI> in most peaceable estate, and the concord of all degrees well established, the day was appointed for the marriage of the King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> which day all they that fancied the Religion esteemed so much the more joyfull to them, because they saw the King wonderfully bent thereunto; and all good men judged the same a most assured pledge and establishment of Civill concord; whereas on the contrary part, the <HI>Guisans,</HI> and other enemies of common quietnesse, greatly abhorred the same Marriage.</P>
<P>When the day came, the Marriage was with Royall pomp solemnized before the great Church of <HI>Paris,</HI> and a certain Form of words so framed, as disagreed with the Religi∣on of neither side, was by the Kings Commandment pronounced by the Cardinall of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbon,</HI> the King of <HI>Navarr's</HI> Uncle; and so the Matrimony celebrate with great joy of the King, and all good men, the Bride was with great trayn and pomp led into the Church to hear Masse, and in the mean time the Bride-groom, who misliked these Ce∣remonies, together with <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> son of <HI>Lewes,</HI> and the Admirall, and other noble men of the same Religion, walked without the Church door, wayting for the Brides return.</P>
<P>While these things were in doing at <HI>Paris, Strozzi,</HI> who as we have said, had the charge of the Kings Power at Sea, hovering upon the Coast of <HI>Rochell,</HI> did now an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then send off his Captains and Souldiers i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to the Town, under colour of buying things necessa∣ry; and som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he came thither also himself. The like was done at the same time in another pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of <HI>France,</HI> by the horse-men of <HI>Gonz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue,</HI> Duke of <HI>Nivers,</HI> neer to the Town of <HI>la Charité,</HI> which hath a Bridge over the River of <HI>Loyre,</HI> and remained t ll that time in the power of those of the Religion, by reason of the great number of them there inhabiting. This Troop was of those horse-men which the King hath accustom∣ed to keep in ordinary wages in every Countrey, whereof the most part were It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lians, Condtrey-men to their Captain <HI>Lewes Gonzague,</HI> to whom the Queen-mother had given the daughter and heir of the Duke of <HI>Nivers</HI> in Marriage. They r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st∣ed of the Towns-men, That they might make their Musters within the Tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<PB N="14" REF="8"/> saying, That they had received warrant from the King so to do, and shewed the Kings Letters therefore. At <HI>Lions</HI> the Governour of the Town, commanded a view to be taken of all those that professed the Religion, and their names to be written in a Book and brought unto him; which Book shortly after, according to the successe, was called the bloudy Book.</P>
<P>After the marriage ended at <HI>Paris,</HI> which was the time that the Admirall had appoin∣ted to return to his own house, he moved the King concerning his departure. But so great was the preparation of playes, so great was the magnificence of Banquets and shews, and the King so earnestly bent to those matters, that he had no leysure, not onely for waighty affairs, but also not so much as to take his naturall sleep. For in the French Court, Dancings, Maskings, Stage-playes (wherein the King exceedingly de∣lighteth) are commonly used in the night time: And so the time that is fittest for Coun∣sell and mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of Governance, is by reason of nightly riotous sitting up, of nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssity consumed in sleep. So great also is the familiarity of men, and the women of the Queen-Mothers train, and so great liberty of sporting, entertainment, and talking together, as to forraign Nations may seem incredible, and be thought of all honest persons a matter not very convenient for preserva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of noble young Ladies chastity. Moreover, if there come any Pandor or Bawde out of <HI>Italy,</HI> or any Schoolmaster of shamefull and filthy lust, he winneth in short time marvellous favour and credit. And such a multitude is there begun to be of Italians, commonly throughout all <HI>France,</HI> specially in the Court, since the administration of the Realm was committed to the Queen-Mother, that many do commonly call it <HI>France-Italian,</HI> and some tearm it a Colony, and some a common Sink of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>These madnesses of the Court, were the cause that the Admirall could not have accesse to the Kings speech, nor entrance to deal in waighty matters. But when they that were sent from the reformed Churches, to complain of injuries commonly done to those of the Religion, understood of the Admirals purpose to depart, they did with all speed deliver to him their Books and Petitions, and besought him, not to depart from the Court, till he had dealt in the cause of the Churches, and delivered their Petitions to the King and His Counsell. For this c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use the Admirall resolved to deferre his going for a while, till he might treat with the Kings Counsell concerning th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se requests: For the King had promised him that he would shortly intend those matters, and be present with the Counsell himself.</P>
<P>Besides this delay, there was another matter that stayed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was owing to the Rutters of <HI>Germany,</HI> which had served on the part of the Religion in the last warre, great summes of money for their wages, in which matter the Admirall travelled with incredible earnestnesse and care.</P>
<P>Concerning all these affairs, the Admirall (as he determined before) having accesse and opportunity for that purpose, moved the Kings privy Councell the twenty second day of <HI>August,</HI> which was the fift day after the King of <HI>Navarr's</HI> marriage, and spent much time in that treaty. About noon, when he was in returning home from the Coun∣sell, with a great company of Noblemen and Gentlemen; behold, a Harquebuzier out of a Window of a house neer adjoyning, shot the Admirall with two bullets of lead through both the Armes. When the Admirall felt himself wounded, nothing at all
<PB N="15" REF="8"/> amazed, but with the same countenance that he was accustomed, he said, through yonder Window it was done; go see who are in the house. What manner of treachery is this? Then he sent a certain Gentleman of his company to the King to declare it unto him. The King at that time was playing at Tennis with the Duke of <HI>Guise.</HI> Assoon as he heard of the Admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als hurt, he was marvellously moved as it seemed, and threw away His Racket that he played with on the ground, and taking with Him His Brother in Law, the King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> He retired into His Castle.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen that were with the Admirall brake into the house, from whence he received his hurt, there they found only one woman, the keeper of the house, and shortly after also a Boy, his lacky, that had done the deed, and therewithall they found the Harquebuze lying upon the Table in that Chamber, from whence the noyse was heard: him that shot they found not, for he in great hast was runne away out at the back Gate, and getting on horse-back, which he had waiting for him ready sadled at the door, he rode a great pace to Saint <HI>Anthonies</HI> Gate, where he had a fresh horse tarrying for him if need were, and another at <HI>Marcelles</HI> Gate. Then by the Kings Commandment a great number rode out in post into all parts to pursue him; but for that he was slipped into by wayes, and received into a certain Castle, they could not overtake him.</P>
<P>At the suite of the King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and others; the King by and by gave Commission for inquiry to be made of the matter, and committed the examining thereof, to three chosen persons of the Parliament of <HI>Paris, Thua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Mor∣sant,</HI> and <HI>Viol</HI> a Counsellor.</P>
<P>First, It was found, That the same house belonged to a Priest, a Canon of Saint <HI>Germain,</HI> whose name is <HI>Villemure,</HI> which had been the Duke of <HI>Guises</HI> Schoolmaster in his youth, and still continued a retainer toward him. Then the woman which we said was found in the house, being taken and brought before them, confessed that a few dayes before, there came to her one <HI>Chally,</HI> sometime a Master <HI>d'Hostel</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Guises</HI> house, and now of the Kings Court, and commanded her to make much of the man that had done this deed, and to lodge him in the same Bed and Chamber where <HI>Villemure</HI> was wont to lye, for that he was his friend and very familiar acquaintance, and that <HI>Villemure</HI> would be very glad of it. The name of him that shot, was very diligently kept secret. Some say it was <HI>Manrevet,</HI> which in the third civill warre, traiterously slew his Captain <HI>Monsieur de Movy,</HI> a most valiant and noble Gentleman, and straightway fled into the enemies Camp. Some say it was <HI>Bondot,</HI> one of the Archers of the Kings guard. When the womans confession was brought to the King, he immediately called <HI>Monsieur de Nance,</HI> Captain of His guard, and commanded him to apprehend <HI>Challey,</HI> and bring him to Him. <HI>Challey</HI> assoon as he heard the stroke of the peace, fled into the Kings Castle called the <HI>Lovure,</HI> and hide him in the Duke of <HI>Guises</HI> Chamber, from whence he conveyed himself away assoon as he had heard of the Kings Commandment. When <HI>de Nance</HI> was informed of his departure, he answered that <HI>Challey</HI> was a Gentle∣man of good worship, and there was no doubt, but when need were, he would appear before the King and the Magistrates.</P>
<P>While these things were doing, and the Admiralls wound in dressing, <HI>Theligny</HI> went by his commandment to the King, and most humbly besought him in the name of his Father-in-Law, That His Majesty would vouchsafe to come unto him, for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is life
<PB N="16" REF="9"/> seemed to be in perill, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he had certain things to say, greatly importing to the Kings safety, which he well knew that none in his Realm durst declare to His Maje∣sty. The King courteously answered, That he would willingly go to him; and within a l ttle while after he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t forward. The Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n-mother went with him, and the Duke of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j w,</HI> the Duke of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>npensier,</HI> a most aff ctionate subject to the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> the Count <HI>de Rhetz,</HI> the Queen-mothers great familiar, <HI>Chavigny,</HI> and <HI>Entragny,</HI> which afterwards were chief ring-leaders in the butchery of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>When the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad lovingly s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luted the Admirall as he was wont to do, and had gently asked him some questions concerning his hurt, and the state of his health, and the Admirall had answered with such a milde and quiet countenance, that all they that were present, wondered at his temperance and patience, the King being much moved (as it seemed) said, The hurt, my Admirall, is done to thee, but the dishonour to me: but by the death of God (saith he) I swear I will so severely revenge both the hurt and the d sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nour, that it shall never be forgotten. He asked him also how he liked of the Judges th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he had chosen to whom he had given Commission for examining the matter. The Admi all answ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red that he could not but very well like of those that His Maj sty had al∣lowed of, yet he besought him, if he thought it good, That <HI>Cavagnes</HI> might be called to couns ll with them, albeit that it was no hard matter to finde out; for it was no doubt (sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he) that this good turn was done him by the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> the revenge whereof he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferred to God. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is only be most hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tily and humbly besought of His Royall Ma∣jesty, that the fact might be duely enqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed upon. The King answe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed that he would take e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnest care of it, and revenge that injury with no lesse severity, then if it had been don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to himself. Then the Kings brethr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and their mother withdrawing themselves a while, the Admirall, as it was afterward known by his own report, began to advise the King to have in mem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry those things that he had often told him, of the dangerous inten∣tions of certain pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns; and he told him, That though he himself had received a great wound, yet there was no lesse hanging over the Kings head: and that long ago there was Treason in practising against his life, which if he would do wisely, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should avoyd be∣times. Further he said, That alth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh so soon as God should take him to him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f out of this life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e doubted not but that his fame should be brought into sundry sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nders by envious persons, and such as owed him evill will, by reason of the late Warres, neverth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesse he had oftentimes disclosed unto the King the authors of the dissentions, and opened the causes thereof, and God was his witnesse of his most faithfull heart to the King and the Common-weal, and that he had never holden any thing dearer then his Countrey, and the publique safety.</P>
<P>The King after such answer made hereunto as he thought best, spake aloud, and hear∣tily entrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Admirall to suffer himself to be removed into his Castle of the <HI>Lovure,</HI> for that he thought some perill, lest there should arise some sedition among the com∣mons already in disorder, or any stirre in that mad and troublesome City. Whereto this speech of the King tended, could not then be understood. For though the com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nalty of <HI>Paris</HI> hath ever been accounted the most foolish and mad of all other, yet is it ever most easily appeased, not onely with the coming and presence of the King, but also with the very sound of his name. The Admirall most humbly and
<PB N="39" REF="9"/> largely thanked the King, &amp; made his excuse upon the counsel of the Phisitiōs, which feared that shaking would encrease his paine, and therefore had taken order that he should not be stirred out of his place. Then the Count <HI>De Rheiz</HI> turning to cer∣taine Gentlemen of the Admirals friends, said, I would the Admirall would follow the Kings counsell, for it is to be feared that some such stir may arise in the Towne, as the King shall not easily be able to appease. Which speech being uttered, although no man did yet suspect whereto that advice tended, yet the Admirall &amp; his friends thought it good to request of the King to assigne unto him certaine of the Souldiers of the guard for his safety. The King answered that he very well liked of that ad∣vice, and that he was fully determined to provide as well for the Admiralls safety as for his owne, and that he would preserve the Admirall as the ball of his eye, and that he had in admiration the constancy and fortitude of the man, and that he never before that time beleeved that there could be so great valiantnesse of courage in any mortall person.</P>
<P>Therewith the Duke of <HI>Aniow</HI> the Kings brother commanded <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssin</HI> Captaine of the Kings Guard, to place a certaine band of Souldiers toward before the Admirals gate. There could hardly a man be found more hatefull against the Admirals part, nor more affected to the Guisians than this <HI>Cossin,</HI> which the successe plainely, pro∣ved, as her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>after shall appeare. The Duke of <HI>Aniow</HI> further added, that he thought it should be good for the Admirall, if moe of his friends, and familiars that lodged in the <HI>Fauxburges,</HI> did draw nearer unto him: and forthwith he commanded the Kings herbingers to warne those to whom they had assigned lodgings in that street, to re∣move from thence, and to place the Admirals friends in their roomes. Which coun∣sell was such, as none could possibly be devised more fit for those things that follo∣wed. For those which might have by flight escaped out of the suburbs were now holden fast inough, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing enclosed not only within the wals of the Towne, but also within the compasse of one narrow street. The next day after, the undermasters of the streets commonly called Quartermen, surveied all the victualing houses and Inns from house to house, and all the names of those of the Religion, together with the place of every of their lodgings they put in bookes, and with speed delivered over the same bookes to those of whom they had received that commandement.</P>
<P>After noone the Queene mother lead out the King, the Duke of <HI>Aniow, Gonzagne, Tauaignes,</HI> the County <HI>De Rhetz</HI> called <HI>Gondin,</HI> into her Gardens called <HI>Tegligers.</HI> This place because it was somewhat far from resort, she thought most fit for this their last consultation. There she shewed them, how those whom they had long beene in wait for, were now sure in hold, and the Admi all lay in his bed maimed of both his armes and could not stirre, the King of <HI>Navar</HI> and Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> were fast lodged in the Castle the gates were kept shut al night &amp; watches placed, so as they were so sna∣red that they could no way escape, and the Captaines thus taken, it was not to bee feared that any of the Religion would from thenceforth stir any more. Now was a notable opportunity (said she) offred to dispatch the matter. For all the chiefe Captaines were fast closed up in <HI>Paris,</HI> and the rest in other Townes were all unar∣med and unprepared, and that there were scarcely to be found ten enemies to a thou∣sand

On the other side (saith she) if the King doe not take the advantage of the fitnesse of this time, it is no doubt but that if the Admirall recover his health, all <HI>France</HI> will shortly be on fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with the fourth civill warre.</P>
<P>The Queenes opinion was allowed. Howbeit it was thought best, partly for his age, and partly for the affinities sake, that the King of <HI>Navars</HI> life should be saved. As for the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> it was doubted whether it were best to spare him for his age, or to put him to death for hatred of his fathers name. But herein the opinion of <HI>Gonzague</HI> tooke place, that he should with feare of death and torment, be drawne from the Religion. So that counsell brake up, with appoyntment that the matter should be put in execution the next night earely before day, and that the ordering and doing of all should be committed to the Duke of <HI>Guise.</HI></P>
<P>The Admirall being enformed of stir and noise of armour, and threatnings heard e∣very where throughout the Towne, and preparation of many things pertaining to tumult, sent word thereof to the King: who answered, that there was no cause for the Admirall to fear, for all was done by his commandement, &amp; not every where, but in certaine places, and that there were certaine appoynted by him to be in armour, least the peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should rise and make any stir in the Towne.</P>
<P>When th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> thought all things ready enough, he called to him the abovesaid Marcell, and charged that he should a little after midnight assemble toge∣ther the Masters of the streets whom they call Diziners into the Towne-house, for he had certine strange and speciall matters in charge from the King, which his plea∣sure was to have declared unto them. They all assembled by time. <HI>Carron</HI> the new provost of Merchants, guarded with certaine Guisians, among the rest <HI>Entrange</HI> and <HI>Pnygallart,</HI> made the declaration: he said that the Kings meaning was to destroy all the Rebels which had in these late yeares borne armes against his Majesty, and to root out the race of those wicked men, it was now very fitly happened that the chiefetaines and ringleaders of them were fast enclosed within the wals of the town, as in a prison, &amp; that the same night they should first begin with them, &amp; afterward for the rest as soon as possibly might be, throughout all parts of the Realme the King would take order: &amp; the token to set upon them, should be given, not with a trumpet, but with tocksein or ringing of the great bell of the pallace, which they knew to be accustomed onely in great cases: and the marke for them to be knowne from other, should be a white linnen cloth hanged about their left arme, and a white crosse pin∣ned upon their caps. In the meane time the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> made privy thereunto the Captaines of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs Guard, both Gascoignes, Frenchmen, and Swizers, and bad them bee ready to goe to it with good courage. Shortly after the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> and the bastard son of King <HI>Henry,</HI> commonly called the Chevalier, with a great band of armed m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n following them, went to the Admiralls house, which <HI>Cos∣sin</HI> kept besieged with barquebuziers placed in order on both sides of the street.</P>
<P>The Admirall advertised of the stir and the noise of the armour, although he had
<PB N="41" REF="11"/> scarcely ten persons in his house able to beare hardnesse, and in his chamber only two Chirurgians, one Preacher, and one or two servitors, yet could not be made afraid, trusting (as he oft rehearsed) upon the Kings good will toward him, approved by so many and so great meanes of assurance, having also confidence the Commonaltie of <HI>Paris</HI> if they once understood the King to mislike of their mad fury, how much so e∣ver they were in outrages yet so soon as they saw <HI>Cossin</HI> warding they gate, the would be appeased. He repeated also the Oath for keeping of the peace, so oft openly sworne by the King and his brethren and their mother, and entred in publke records, the league lately made with the Queene of <HI>England</HI> for the same cause, the Articles of treaty covenanted with the Prince of <HI>Aurenge,</HI> the Kings faith given to the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> some Towns attempted and some taken in the low Countrie by the Kings commandement, the marriage of the Kings Sister solemnized but 6 days before, which it was not like that he would suffer to be defiled with blood, finally the judgement of forraine nations and of posterity, shame and the honour and constancy of a Prince, publike faith, and the sacred respect of the law of the nations, all which it seemed monstrous and incredible, the King could assent to be stained with so outragious a cruell deed.</P>
<P><HI>Cosson</HI> when he saw the Noblemen draw neere, knocked at the gate, which as is a∣bovesaid, he was commanded by the Du. of <HI>Amow</HI> to keep. Wherupon many applyed the old proverb, a goodly guard to make the woolf keeper of the sheep. When he was entred without any opposition, he carried in with him divers armed men &amp; Lords. Such as Cossin found at the entry of, and within the porch of the House, he slew with a partisan that he had in his hand. Which when the Admirall understood, he caused those that were about him to lift him out of his bed, and casting on a night gowne upon him, he rose upright on his feet, he bad his friends and Servants to shift for themselves, and to take no care for him, for he said that hee was ready with most willing heart to render into the hands of God the spirit that he had lent him to use for a time, and said that this violent cruelty was prepared not so much for his de∣struction, as for the dishonouring Christ, and the tormenting so many Churches, the defence of which Churches, he had at the Petition of all godly men, with his many dangers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd calamities sustained.</P>
<P>In the meane time their came up the staires into the higher part of the House, one <HI>Benvese</HI> Germain, brought up in the house of the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> &amp; to whom it is said, that the Cardinall of Loraine had given one of his bastard daughters in marriage; and with him came <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssin</HI> the <HI>Gascoine. Attin</HI> a Piccard, a retainer and familiar of the Duke de <HI>Aumal,</HI> one that a few yeares before sought to murther <HI>de Andelot</HI> by trea∣son, and also one <HI>Haford</HI> an <HI>Avernots,</HI> all weaponed, and armed with shirts of maile.</P>
<P>When they were broken into the Admirals chamber, <HI>Benvse</HI> came to him, and drawing his sword upon him, said, art not thou the Admirall, he with a quiet and constant countenance (as we have since understood by them) answered, <HI>I</HI> am so cal'd, And then seeing the sword drawn upon him he said, young man, consider the weak case that <HI>I</HI> am now in. But the fellow, after blaspheming God, first thrust his sword into the Admirals brest; then strucke him upon the head, &amp; <HI>Attin</HI> shot him through the breast with a Pistoll. When the Admirall was with this wound not quite dead,
<PB N="42" REF="12"/> <HI>Benvese</HI> gave him the third wound upon the thigh, &amp; so he fel down for dead. When the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> which stayed in the Court with the other Noble men, heard this, he cryed out alowd, hast thou done <HI>Benvese?</HI> he answered, I have done. Then said the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> our Chevalier (meaning King <HI>Henries</HI> bastard abovesaid) unlesse he see it with his eyes, will not beleeve it: throw him downe at the window. Then <HI>Benvese</HI> with the helpe of his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowes tooke up the Admirals body and threw it downe through the window. When by reason of the wound in his head, and his face cove∣red with bloud they could not w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll discerne him, the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> kneeled downe on the ground &amp; with a napkin wiped him &amp; said, now I know him, it is he. And there∣withall going out at the gate with the rest of the Lords, he cryed out to the multi∣tude in amour, saying; my companions we have had a good lucky beginning: now let us goe forward to the rest, for it is the Kings commandement: which words hee did oft repeat alowd, saying, thus the King commandeth: this is the Kings will, this is his pleasure. And then he commanded the token to be given by ringing tock∣sein with the great bell of the palace, and alarme to be raise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and he caused it to be published, that the conspiratours were in armour and about to kill the King. Then a certaine Italian of <HI>Gonzagues</HI> band, cut off the Admirals head, and sent it preserved with spices to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pope and the Cardinall of <HI>Loraine.</HI> Other cut off his hands, and other his secret parts. Then the common labourers and rascals three dayes together draged the dead body thus mangled and berayed with bloud and filth, through the streets and afterward drew it out of the Towne to the common gallowes, and hanged it up with a rope by the feet.</P>
<P>In the meane time, those of the Noble mens bands brake into all the Chambers of the Admirals house, and such as they found either in their beds, or hidden, they mangled them with many wounds, and so slaughtered them. Of that number were two young children, pages, of honourable birth. There was also the Count <HI>Rochfaul∣cault,</HI> which for the excellent pleasantnesse of his wit, and for his valiantnesse was highly beloved of King <HI>Henry,</HI> and so seemed for the same cause also to be beloved of the King. Him was De <HI>Nance</HI> abovesaid commanded to kill, but he refusing it for their old acquainta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce and familiarity: one <HI>Laberge</HI> an <HI>Avernais</HI> off'red himselfe to doe it, but with this condition, that the King should give him the Captaineship of horsemen which Count <HI>Rochfoucault</HI> had. There was also slain <HI>Theligny</HI> the Admirals son in Law, a young man of singular towardnesse both of wit and courage, to whom the King thefe many yeeres had both in words and countenance made shew of so great good wil, as that no man was thought to be more highly in his savor. He crying cut, that it was now grievous to him to live, for that he had ever commended to his father in law the faithfulnesse of the King, refused not the death off'red him. And many other most flourshing yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Noble men and Gentlemen were every where but∣cherly murthered in that street. Then the Noble mens bands, and <HI>Cossins</HI> souldiers went ransacking from house to house: and the Admirals house and all the other hou∣ses were all sacked and spoyled, even in like manner as is used to be done by souldi∣ers greedy of prey, in a Towne taken by assault: and many by this robbery, were of beggers sodainly become rich men. For the Duke of <HI>Guise;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Monpensier,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="12"/> the Cheualier King Henries bastard, <HI>Gonzague, Tauaignes,</HI> and the other great Lords, did with reward of the spoyle and bootie encourage the multitude to the slaughter, and cried out aloud that this was the Kings will. So all the rest of the day from mor∣ning to evening, the rascall multitude, encouraged by spoyle and robberie, ran with their bloody swords raging throughout all the towne: they spared not the aged nor women, nor the very babes, in ioy and triumph they threw the slaine bodies out at the windowes; so as there was not in manner any one streete or lane, that seemed not strawed with murthered carcases.</P>
<P>While these things were thus a doing in the towne, the King of Navarre and the prince of Conde, whom the King had lodged in his owne castle of the Lowre, were by the Kings Commaundement sent for and conveyed unto him. But their compa∣ny, their servitors of their chamber, their friends reteining to them, their schole∣masters, and those that had the bringing up of them, crying out aloud to the Kings fidelitie for succoure, were thrust out of the chambers, and by the Kings guard of Switzers hewed in pieces and slaughtered in the Kings own sight. But of that num∣ber of persons slayne, no mans cause was so much lamented of many, as Monsieur de Pilles, in whom it is hard to expresse whether there were more godly zeale in Reli∣gion, or prowesse in warre, Whereby having in the lite yeares, specially by the de∣fence of the town of Saint Iohn d'Angeli, which the King then besieged, gotten great honour of chevalrie, he was thought very well beloved and highly esteemed of the King, Him and Leran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the sonne of Odou, by the French Kings commandement (which was not then vnderstood whereto it tended) the King of Navarre had stayed in a Wardrope adioyning to his owne chamber, and caused them to lodge there all night. A little afore day, hearing the running of men, and noyse of Armor, and cries and killings, they rose in haste, and immediatly <HI>de Nance,</HI> whom we have before spo∣ken of, came to them, and commaunded them in the Kings name to come downe in∣to the Court, and to leave their weapons behind them, and lastly to depart out of the castle. When <HI>de Pilles</HI> saw himselfe thrust out among the multitude of the murthering souldiers, and beheld the bodies of them that were slaine, he cried out with a very lowde voice that the King might well heare him protesting upon the Kings fidelitie, and detesting his trayterous infidelitie, and therwith he took off a rich cloake which he wore, and gave it to one of his acquaintance, saying, take here this token of <HI>Pilles</HI> and hereafter remember <HI>Pilles</HI> most unworthyly and shamfully slaine. Oh my good Monsieur <HI>de Pilles,</HI> said the other, I am none of them: I thanke you for your cloake, but I will not receive it with that condition, and so refused to take the cloake: and immediately <HI>de Pilles</HI> was thrust through by one of the guarde with a partisan, and died. And this end had this most valiant and noble gentleman. And then his body was throwen into the quarrey with the rest, which when they that passed by did be∣hold, the souldiers cryed out, there they be that made assault vpon vs, and would have killed the King-<HI>Leranne</HI> being thrust through with a Sword, escaped and ran in∣to the Queene of <HI>Navarres</HI> chamber, and was by hir kept and preserved from the violence of those that persued him.

<P>While things were in doing at Paris, Strozzi, which (as we have aforesaid) was come withall his powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Rochell, sent a great number of his souldiers into the towne, vnder colour of a banket to be made to his friends in the castell <HI>la Chein, e</HI> but by reason of the iealousie and wathes of the townes men, by whom he saw his trea∣son was espied, he went away without his purpose.

The profit of all the Robberies came to the hands of these labourers, and to the Kings treasury little or nothing. The onely gaine the King had, was that which might be made of the Vacations, as they terme them, of Offices and of places of charge whereof he gave a great part freely away to diverse of the Court.

For it hath bin the custome now lately of certaine Kings of Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e (such as among fo∣raigne nations hath not bin heard of) to put to sale all the profits, rights, and bene∣fits of the crowne, and to keepe a Market for money, of all judiciall offices, and of all the roomes belonging to his treasure or firnances, according to a rate of price set upon every one of them: and there is not in manner one in all France, that doth not openly iustifie that he bought his office for ready mony, and that no man ought to marvell if he desire to fill up the empty hole of his stock againe. And therefore justice is through all France usually bought for money, and though there be never so many murders committed, yet is there no processe awarded to enquire thereof, till present coyne be payd to the rakehells and scribes.</P>
<P>This butchetly slaughter of Paris thus pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>formed, and foure hundred houses (as is abovesayd) sacked, immediatly messenges were sent in post into all parts of the Realme, with oft shifting their horses for hast, to command all other Cities in the Kings name to follow the example of <HI>Paris,</HI> and to cause to be killed as many as they had among them of the reformed Religion.</P>
<P>These commandements it is wonderfull to tell how readily and cheerefully the greatest part of the Cities of France did obey and execute. But the King, fearing (as it was likely) the dishonour of false treacherie and periury, sent letters to the Governours of his Provinces, and also speedy messengers into England, Germany, and Switzerland, to declare in his name, that there was a great commotion and seditious stir hapned at Paris, which he was very sorry for, that the Duke of <HI>Guise</HI> had raised armed men and made an assault upon the band that was assigned to the Admirall for his guard, and had broken in to the house, and slaine the Admirall &amp; his houshold servants, &amp; that the King had hardly kept safe from those dangers his owne castle of the <HI>Lower</HI> where he kept himselfe close with his mother and his Bre∣thren:
<PB N="45" REF="13"/> the true copie of which letter is hereafter inserted, but the same most mighty and by the consent of all Nations commonly called the most Christian King, within two dayes after came into the Parliament accompanied with a great traine of his bre∣thren, and other Princes. The councell being assembled, he sitting in his throne, began to speake unto them, he declared that he was certified, that the Admirall with cer∣taine of his complices had conspired his death, and had intended the like purpose a∣gainst his Brethren, the Queen his Mother, and the King of <HI>Navar,</HI> and that for this cause he had commanded his friends to slay the said Admirall and all his confederates, and so to prevent the treason of his enemies.</P>
<P>This his testification and declaration, the King commanded to bee written and en∣tred in the records of the Parliament, and that it should be proclaimed by the Heraldes, and published by Printers. And he willed a booke to be set forth to this effect, that the slaughter of the Admirall and his adherents was done by the Kings commandement, for so was his Maiesties expresse pleasure, because they had conspi∣red to kill him and his brethren. and the Queene his Mother, and the King of <HI>Navar.</HI></P>
<P>And further, that the King did forbid that from thenceforth there should be more ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mblies holden, or preachings used of the Religion.</P>
<P>After the Kings oration ended, <HI>Christopher Thuane</HI> President of that Parliament, a man very notable for his light braine and his cruell heart, did with very large words con∣gratulate unto the King, that he had now with guile and subtiltie overcome these his enemies, whom he could never vanquish by Armes and battell, saying therein that the King had most fully verified the old saying of <HI>Lewes</HI> the eleventh, his progenitor King of France, which was wont to say that he knew never a Latine sentence but this one, <HI>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare,</HI> He that cannot skill to dissemble, cannot skill to be a king. But <HI>Pibrace,</HI> the advocate of the Finances, made a short oration, the sum whereof was to this effect, that although the King had iust and great cause to bee dis∣pleased, yet he thought it more agreeable with his Maiesties clemency and goodnesse to make an end of the slaughters and common spoyle, and not to suffer such outrages any longer committed without iudiciall proceeding in the cause: and besought his Maiesty that from thenceforth it would please him to use the Law, which is well knowne to be the onely stablishment of Kingdomes and Empires: and that there had bin already given to the commonaltie too perilous an example to follow. An arrest of Parliament with the Kings Royall assent being made to that effect, there were imme∣diately Heralds and Trumpetters sent round about all the Towne, and an edict pro∣claimed in the Kings name, that from thenceforth the slaughters and common but∣cherly murtherings should cease, and that all persons should abstaine from pillage and robberie.</P>
<P>This being knowne, there were diverse speeches used of this matter throughout the Towne, and specially of learned men: The most part said, that they had read many histories, but in all memory of all ages, they never heard of any such thing as this. They compared this case with the horrible doing of King <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thridates,</HI> which with one Messenger, and with the advertisement of one letter, caused 150 thousand Ro∣mans to be slaine; Some compared it with the doing of Peter of Aragon, who

Thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kings were bound by no promise, but such as was given to the strangers themselves: this King was with a new made league bound to the Kings and Princes his neighbours to keepe the peace that he had sworn. Those Kings used no guileful meanes unworthy for the Majesty of a King, to deceive: this King for a bait and allurement abused the marriage of his owne Sister, and in a manner besprinkled her wedding robe with blood, which dishonour and indignitie, no posterity of all ages can forget. Some againe discoursed, that though this wicked advice seemed to many Courtiers to have bin profitable, yet not onely the honour of the King, but also the estimation and good fame of the whole nation was against that shew of profit. They alledged how <HI>Aristid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> did openly in the audience of all the people, reject the counsell of <HI>Themistocles,</HI> con∣cerning the burning of the Lacedemonian Navie, although it must needes have fol∣lowed, that the power of the Lacedemonians their enemies, should thereby have bin ut∣terly weakned. <HI>Furius Camillus</HI> received not the children of the chief Phalisce, betrayed to him by their schoole-master, but stripped him naked, and delivered him to be whip∣ped home with rods by the same children. <HI>Pausanias</HI> hath left it repo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, that the po∣sterity of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI> fell into many calamities, for this cause, that he was wont to set light by the conscience of an oath, and his faith given in Leagues. Some cited the law of the twelve tables, <HI>Si patronus clienti fraudem facit, sacer esto.</HI> if the Patrone or Soveraigne defraud his client or Vassall, be he out of protection, They disputed also that like faith as the vassall oweth to his Lord, the Lord oweth also to his vassall, and for what causes, and for what felonies the vassall loseth his tenancies, for the same causes and felonies the Lord loseth his Seigniorie. Some said that the right hand in ancient time was called the pledge of the Faith of a King, and that if a King shall despise, there is no communion of right with him, and he is no more to be accounted a King, neither of his owne subjects, nor of strangers. Kingly Vertues in times past have bin reported to be these, justice, gentlenesse, and clemencie: but cruelty and out∣rage have ever bin dispraised both in all persons, and specially in Princes. <HI>Scipio</HI> hath in all ages bin praised, who was wont to say, that he had rather save one Citizen, then kill a thousand enemies, which sentence, <HI>Antonius</HI> the Emperour, surnamed <HI>Pius</HI> the kind or vertuous did often repeat. It was a most shamefull by-word of young <HI>Tibe∣rius,</HI> to be called Clay, tempered with blood. They say also, as Kings have power of life or death over their subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but not without hearing the cause, and the iudiciall proceeding: that there can be alledged no greater authority, then the Dictators had at Rome, in whom was the Soveraigne power of peace and war, of life and death, and without appeale, yet was it not lawfull for them to execute a citizen, his cause un∣heard. Onely theeves and Murtherers take away mens lives without order of Law, &amp; hearing their cause. Who can doubt (said they) but that this so great outrage, so great shedding of Christian blood is the fruit of the cursed life of the Courtiers? For (said they) now throughout all France, whoredome and loose leudnesse of life are so
<PB N="23" REF="15"/> free and usuall, that now the most part of the women of <HI>France</HI> seeme to be in manner common: and the wicked blasphemies and continuall execrations and dishonorings of Gods most holy name and Majestie, are such as God cannot longer beare: and true it is, though incredible among forreine Nations, that the Catholikes of France have prescribed themselves this for a speciall marke to be knowne from other men, that at every third word they blasphemously sweare by the head, death, blood, &amp; bellie of GOD: and wonderfull it is, that the King himselfe is so much delighted in this custome of swearing and blaspheming: and this as it were a pestilent infecti∣on is spred abroade and common among the very Plough-men and Peasants, so as none among them now speaketh three words without most filthy blaspheming and horrible execration of God. Who can longer beare the vile unchastities, the Bawds and Ruffians of the Court? Finally, very nature it selfe doth now as it were expostu∣late with God for his so long sufferance and forbearing, and the very earth can no longer beare these monsters.</P>
<P>Now as touching the Admirals supposed conspiracie, who can thinke it likely that he should enterprise any such thing within the walls of <HI>Paris?</HI> For in the Court there is continually watching and warding a garrison of the Kings: and at the entry of his Castle the guards of <HI>Gascoines, Scots</HI> and <HI>Switzers,</HI> are continually attending; and the King himself both alwaies before, and specially at that time, by reason of his sters marriage, had a great trayne of Princes, great Lords, Noblemen and Gentle∣men about him. Moreover it was well knowne, that in <HI>Paris</HI> within three houres space might be assembled and put in Armour, threescore thousand chosen armed men, specially against the Admirall, whom no man is ignorant that the <HI>Parisians</HI> most dead∣ly hated: beside that, the Noble young men that came thither with the King of <HI>Na∣varre</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> by reason of the marriage, &amp; brought with them their wives, their sisters and their kinswomen, thought at that time upon nothing but up∣on triumph, and exercises of pastime, and gay furniture of apparell and ornaments. Finally, at whither of these two times can it be likely that the Admirall attempted this conspiracie? was it before he was hurt? why? at that time he found the King his most loving, or at least his most liberall and bountifull good Lord: neither could be hope ever to have a more favourable Soveraigne in <HI>France.</HI> Was it then after hee was hurt? as though forsooth he lying sore of two so great woundes, aged, maimed of both his armes, the one wherof the Phisitians consulted whether it were to be cut off, accompanied with three hundred young men, would set upon threescore thousand armed men, or in so small a time could lay the plot for so great, and so heynous a fact: for he lived scarce fortie houres after his hurt, in which time he was enjoyned by the Physitians to forbeare talke. Againe, if he had bin detected of any such crime, was he not committed to <HI>Cossin</HI> and to his keeping, and so environed, all the wries beset about him, and so in the Kings power that if it had pleased the King he might at all times in a moment be caried to prison? why was not orderly inqui∣ry and judiciall proceeding used according to the custome and lawes and generall right of Nations, and witnesses produced according to the forme of Law? but be it, that the Admirall and a few other of his confederats and followers had conspired? why yet proceeded the outragious cruelty upon the rest that were innocent, why upon ancient Matrons? why upon noble Ladies and young Gentlewomen and Vir∣gins
<PB N="25" REF="16"/> that came thither for the honour of the Wedding? why were so many women greate with childe, against the Lawes of all Nations and of nature, before their deli∣very throwen into the River? why were so many aged persons, many that lay sick in their beds; many Gowne-men, many Councellors, Advocates, Proctors, Physiti∣ans, many singularly learned Professors and teachers of good Arts, and among the rest <HI>Petrus Ramus,</HI> that renowned man throughout the world; many young students, executed without hearing, without pleading their cause, without sentence of con∣demnation? moreover, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Admirall had slaine the three Brethren, who doubt∣eth but that all Countries, all Cities, all Par iaments, finally, all sorts and degrees of men would have speedily taken Armor and easily have destroyed all of the Religi∣on, having them enclosed within their Townes, and having just cause to render to all forraine Nations for their common sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughters and killing of men?

<P>Now to returne to <HI>Paris,</HI> the Admiralls body being hanged up by the heeles upon the common Gallowes of <HI>Paris,</HI> as is aforesaid, the <HI>Parisians</HI> went thither by heapes to see it; and the Queene Mother to feede her eyes with that spectacle, had a minde also to go thither, and she caried with her the King and both her other Sonnes, but the next night following, the body was conveyed away, and (as it is thought) bu∣ried about that time, whereas many of the Court secretly muttered that the King should by this fact incurre dishonour, not only among forreine Nations, but also with all posteritie in time to come for ever, <HI>Morvillier,</HI> of whom we have made mention before, one that is accompted the principall lewd practiser and wicked sycophant of all <HI>France,</HI> and the first author and chiefe meanes of bringing the Jesu∣ites into <HI>France,</HI> came to the Queene Mother and told her, that it was best that some of those that were lately taken flying and hiding themselves, should for ma∣ners sake be brought to open judgement, and after the accustomed manner should be enquired upon, that they might be condemned by the sentence of certaine Judges picked out for that purpose, and so openly executed in sight of the people. There were called to counsell hereupon <HI>Birage, Limege, Thuan,</HI> and <HI>Belleure.</HI> They not only allowed <HI>Morvilliers</HI> opinion, but also gave advice, that a man of hey made in figure for the Admirall (for his body, as we have said, could not be found) should be drag∣ged by the Boureau through the streets, his armes and Ensignes of honour broken, his memory condemned, his Castles and farmes rased, his children pronounced in∣famous, unnoble, and intestable, and all the trees in his woods to be hewen downe to the height of sixe foote. There was among those that were apprehended, one <HI>Cavaignes,</HI> master of Requests to the King, and <HI>Briquemault,</HI> of whom we have be∣fore spoken; This <HI>Briquemault</HI> had spent his time in Service in the old wars, in the time of King <HI>Francis</HI> and King <HI>Henry,</HI> and was for the war accompted a man of great experience among the best now living, and was neere about threescore and ten yeares olde. As soone as they were carried into prison, there were presented unto them all the tormenter and the hangman, and they were threatned with torture and tearing their bodies in pieces, unlesse they would presently subscribe with their own hands, that they were of councell with the Admirall to kill the King and his brethren, and the Queene Mother, and the King of <HI>Navarre.</HI> They all cried out that they were ready to suffer death most willingly, forasmuch as the Kings pleasure was it should be so: but so great torture they could not beare, and therefore humbly besought his royall goodnesse and clemencie to pardon them that torment, and yet trusting upon the mercy of God, they hoped that they should suffer exceeding great paines, rather then staine themselves with so great shame, or confesse an untrue crime against themselves. They that were first assigned their judges, hearing their cries and defences, and fearing the judgement of the world, said plainly that they would not draw upon themselves most assured infamie for condemning them. Ther∣fore there were new Judges appointed in their places: to them was adjoyned such
<PB N="26" REF="17"/> a tormenter and notarie, as were thought fittest for the purpose. And so <HI>Briquemault</HI> and <HI>Cavaignes</HI> were quickly condemned by a shadowed forme of Law, and led to the gibbet standing in the principall streete of the Towne, and in the sight of many thou∣sands of men gazing at them, To this spectacle the Queene-mother led the King and her other Sonnes, and her Sonne in law the King of <HI>Navarre.</HI></P>
<P>It was thought commodious for playing of this last act, that Briquemault should in hearing of all the People aske pardon of the King, and for that purpose there were some suborned to put him in minde, that if hee would hee might easi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y purchase his life, for the King was of nature full of clemencie and mercy, and if hee would aske pardon of his majestie with confessing his offence, hee should easily obtaine it. Hee answered with a valiant and bold courage, that it was not his part but the Kings to aske pardon of God for this fault: and that hee would never crave forgivenesse of that offence whereof hee well knew himselfe and had God to witnesse that hee was cleare and innocent. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verthelesse, hee besought God to forgive the King this fault. So were thefe two excellent and famous men with halters fastened about their necks thrown by the hangman from the ladder and hanged, and therewithall also the man of straw made for figure of the Admirall, was tyed fast and hanged with them, after a preposterous order of Law, whereby the Admirall was first slaine and then con∣demned.</P>
<P>But whereas in a manner in all Townes there were great sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughters committed, yet was there none more horrible nor more outragious then the Butcherly murder at Li∣ons. So soone as the Letters from the Court were brought to <HI>Mandelot</HI> governor of the Towne; first, by a cryer and trumpet he caused to be proclaymed, that all the pro∣fessors of the Religion should appeare presently before him at his house. They with∣out all delay repaired to him: As soone as they were come, he commanded them all to suffer themselves to be led to prison by such officers as should be assigned them. They obeyed his word and followed the officers that led them. By reason of the great multitude, they sorted them into sundry prisons; then <HI>Mandelot</HI> willed the common Executioner to be commanded in his name to take some to helpe him, and to kill those that were in prison. The executioner answered, that he used not to execute the Law upon any but such as were condemned, and in publike and open places, and therefore willed him to seeke another slaughterman if he would. <HI>Mandelot</HI> thus refused by the Executioner, commanded the garrison Souldiers of the Castle to do it, the Souldiers answered, that it was against their honour, to use weapons upon men bound and lying suppliant before them; if they had raised any rebellion, or had offended or provoked them, they said they would most readily have fought with them; being thus refused by them also, at the last he committed the matter to the watermen and Butchers, those fellowes being let into the prisons, went to it with chopping knives and Butchers ax∣es. Such as they found prostrate at their feete, pittiously holding up their hands to hea∣ven, crying upon the mercie of God and men, they did for sport cut off their fingers and the tops of their hands, and throughout the whole towne was heard such a cry and lamentable howling of women and children, that innumerable people, even such as were zealously given even to the Popish Religion, did detest that cruelty, and judged that not men but outragious savage beasts in shape of men were entred into the prisons. It is well knowne, that a great number of honest women in the town great with childe,
<PB N="27" REF="17"/> were so flighted with the horror of it, that they were delivered before their time; and out of the Court of the goale called the Arch-Bishops prison, the blood was seene in the broad day light, to the great abhorring and feare of many that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>held it, run warme and smoaking into the next streets of the towne, and so down into the River of <HI>Sene.</HI> There was in that same Arch-Bishops prison an aged man called <HI>Francis Collut,</HI> a Mar∣chant of caps, and two young men his Sonnes, whom he had ever caused dilligently to be taught and instructed in Religion, when he saw the Butchers come toward him with their axes, he began to exhort his Children not to refuse the death offred by God. For (said he) it is the perpetuall destinie of Religion, and that often such sacrifices doe betide in Christian Churches, and Christians in all ages have ever beene, and for ever to the worlds end so shall be, as Sheepe among Wolves, Doves among Hawkes, and sacrifices among Priests. Then the old Father embraced his two young Sonnes, and ly∣ing flat on the ground with them, crying aloude upon the mercy of God, was with many woundes both he and his Sonnes slaughtered by those Butchers: and long time afterward their three bodies had, knit t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gether, yeelded a pittious spectacle to many that beheld them. In the meane time <HI>Mandelot</HI> in jest and scorne (as it seemed) caused to be proclaymed by the cryer, that no man should commit any slaughter in the towne, and that if any would detect the doers of any such slaughter, he would give him a hun∣dred crownes in reward for his information. And from that time they ceased not to kill, to robbe, and to spoyle. The next day after, which was the first day of <HI>September,</HI> the greatest part of the dead bodies were throwen into the River of <HI>Sene,</HI> and the rest of them <HI>Mandelot,</HI> to feede and glut his eyes and heart with blood, caused to be carried by Boate to the other side of the water, and there to be throwen downe upon the greene grasse neere unto the Abbey called <HI>Esue.</HI></P>
<P>There the people of Lions, specially the <HI>Italians,</HI> of whom by reason of the Mart there is geat store in the Towne, satisfied their eyes a while, and did such spites as they could to these heaps of carcases, and so exercised their cruelty not upon the li∣ving onely, but also upon the dead. And there hapned one thing which for the abho∣minable cruelty is not to be omitted. There came to that spectacle certaine Apotheca∣ries, and among those bodies they perceived some very fat ones, by and by they went to the Butchers, and told them that they did use to make certaine speciall medicines of mans greace, and that they might make some profit thereof. Which as soone as the Butchers understood, they ran to the heaps and chose out the fattest, and laun∣ced them with their knives, and pulled out the fat, and sold it for money to the Apothecaries.</P>
<P>While these things were doing at Lions, the King being enformed that diverse of the Religion had left their wives and children, and were fled out of the other townes, and lurked some in the woods, and some among their friends such as tooke pitty on them, he practised with faire words to allure and call them home againe. He sent to every part messengers and letters, affirming that he was highly displ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased with those slaughters and horrible butcheries, and that he would that such cruelty sh uld be severely punished: and if the Admirall with a few of his confederates had entred in∣to any secret practise, it was no reason, that so many innocents should beare the pu∣nishment due to a few. Many sweetly beguiled with these words of the King and with the letters of the Governours, retired home againe to their dwellings and hou∣ses,
<PB N="28" REF="18"/> specially they of <HI>Rhoan, Diepe,</HI> and <HI>Tholouse.</HI> There were scant two d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> passed when they were againe commanded to prison, where they were all shut up. Then were murtherers a new appointed of the most base and rascall of the people, to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ment them with all kinde of torture, and then to slay them. And throughout the whole Realme of <HI>France</HI> for thirty dayes together there was no end of killing, slay∣ing and robbing, so that at this day there are about a hundreth thousand little babes, Widdowes and Children, that were well borne, that now Fatherlesse and Motherlesse live wandering and in beggerie. About this time the King caused to be proclaimed, that such as had any office or place of charge, unlesse they would speedily returne to the Catholique, Apostolique and Romish Church, should give over those their tem∣porall roomes. There was no towne nor any so small a village or hamlet wherein all the professors of the Religion were not compelled either to goe to Masse, or presently to take the sword into their bosomes: and in many places it happened that such as being amazed with the suddainenesse of the matter had abjured their Religion, yet notwithstanding were afterward slaine.</P>
<P>And while these things were still in doing, yet the King in the meane while sent a∣broad his letters and messag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s into all parts, and caused to be proclaimed with Trum∣pet, that his pleasure was that the Edicts of pacification should be observed: and although they could not have freedome to use and exercise their Religion in open places, yet they should have liberty permitted them to retaine and professe it with∣in their owne houses, and that no man should meddle with or disturbe the goods and possessions of those of the Religion.</P>
<P>And the same King which but few dayes before, had by letters directed to all the Governours of his Provinces signified that his cousin the Admirall was slaine by the Duke of Guise to his great sorrow, and that himselfe was in great danger, the same King I say, now caused it with sound of Trumpet to be proclaimed that the trayte∣rous and wicked Admirall was slaine by his Will and Commandement. He that in few dayes before had by new authority confirmed the libertie of Religion permitted by his Edicts of pacification, the same King did now not onely take from the profes∣sors thereof their offices and honours, but also prescribed them in precise forme of words a forme of abjuring and detesting their Religion. Which things least any man should doubt of, we shall hereafter set downe the very true copies of the said Letters, Edicts and Abjuration.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter of the Treasurer of the leagues of the Switzers, written by the Kings Commande∣ment unto the said Leagues, of the same argument that the former Letters were.</HEAD>
<P>NOble Seigniours, <HI>Monsieur de la Fontaine,</HI> Ambassador for the King your assured and perfect friend and confederate, and I his Treasurer in this Country, having commande∣ment of his Majesty to communicate with you, as with them whom he accounteth his chief and sure friends, of a chance which lately happened in the City of Paris, his own person and Court then being there, whereof he received so much more griefe and displeasure, because it fell on such a time as he feared least, or looked for such a thing. The matter is this. On the 27. day of August last the Admirall as he went from Louure, was with an harquebuze shot hurt in the hand and arme, whereof when his Majesty was advertised, he commanded incontinent that search and pu∣nishment were had of the oftend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and the authors of such a mischiefe: whereunto when he had readily laid his hand by his Officers, and committed the inhabitants of the house, where the harquebuze was shot, to prison they which were the cause first of the mischiefe (as it may easily be presupposed) because they would prevent the inquisition thereof, heaping one transgression upon another, on the 23. and 24. of the said moneth assembled a great troupe of people in the night, and moved the people of Paris to a very great sedition, who in a rage set upon the Admi∣rals lodging, and enforcing the Guard which his Majesty had set for the Admirals surety and keeping, slew him with certaine other gentlemen in his company, as the like also was committed upon others in the City, the matter growing in the very same instant to such an outrage and commotion, that whereas his Majesty had thought to provide remedy for appeasing thereof, he had much a doe with all his Guards to keep his house at Louure, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e he lodged with the two Queenes, his mother and the Spouse the Lords his brethren, the King of Navar and ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Prin∣ces. Think therefore yee noble Seigniours, in what a perplexity this young and couragious King now standeth, who, as a man may say, hath held in his hand thornes in stead of a Scepter ever since his comming to the Crown for that great troubles which have almost ever since bin in his Realme, and therefore by the good and wise counsell and assistance of the Queene his mother and the Lords his brethren, thought to enjoy and establish a more sure repose in his Realme,
<PB N="32" REF="20"/> and a more happy government for himselfe and his subjects, after he had taken away (as hee thought) all occasions of dissentions amongst his subjects by the meanes of his Edict of Paci∣fications, and of the Marriage of the King of Navarre to the Lady his Sister, and the Prince of Cōde to Madame de Nevers; Besides all this, to the intent nothing should bee left undone that might serve for the quieting of all things and especially for the Admirals safegard his Majesty as every man knoweth, hath done his endeavour to the uttermost, to appease and reconcile his principall and most dangerous enemies unto him. And so God the true Judge of the Kings Ma∣jesties good and pure intent brought to passe, that the peoples rage being quieted within a few houres, every one went home to his house, and the King had speciall regard to nothing more than to see nothing attempted or innovated contrary to his Edicts of Pacification, &amp; the repose of his Subjects as well of the one Religion as of the other. And for that purpose hath sent to di∣ver, of his Governours and Officers in his Provinces, to looke diligently to the observing of his Edicts, with expresse commandement to hold their hands there that every one might perceive that the chance at Paris happened for some private quarrell and not for any purpose to alter this Edicts, which his Majesty will in no wise suffer. Which is the principall thing, noble Seigni∣ours that his Majesty hath commanded us on his part to assure you, and to let you understand the dangers that depend over him and his neighbours, not so much for this sedition, for he trust∣eth in God that shall grow no further and his Majesty will keep his Realme in as good repose as it hath bin since his last Edict of Pacification but for the great mustering and assembling men of war in many places, specially in the low Countries, where it is yet uncertaine on which side God will give the victory nor whether the Conquerour will employ his force after his conquest Wherefore his Majesty prayeth you, continuing the good love and intelligence which hath al∣waies bin betwixt the Crowne of France and his allied and confederate friends the Seigniours of the Leagues, to have good regard to him and his Realme an case that need shall require as he will have to you and your prosperous estate if it be requisite employing in the meane while your great and singular wisedome to the preservation of the union of the Nation in League, which is the onely cause to make you, not onely able to send succour to your friends, but also maintaine your selves in estimation that you may be a terrour to your neighbours, how great soever they be his Majesty promising you in all occurrents as much friendship, favour and assistance, as you can desire, and to be as entire and perfect a friend, as ever your Nation had any.</P>

<HEAD>Remembrances and Instructions sent by the King to the Count of Charny his generall Lievte∣nant in Burgundie, of the same argument.</HEAD>
<P>THe King considering the commotion lately happened in Paris, wherein the L.

And thinking that for remedy hereof it is very needf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll for the Governors of the Provinces in his Realme to goe round about their governements: for this occasion hee willeth that the Count of Charny great Esquire of Fraunce, and his Majesties Lieutenant generall for the government of Burgundie, shall go dili∣gently through all Cities and places of the said government, and as he arriveth in every place, he shall devise the best wayes that he can to make peace. union and quietnesse amongst the Kings Subjects, as well of the one Religion as of the other. And to bring it the better about, he shal gently call before him in open or private place as he shall see best cause for his Majesties service herein, the Gentlemen of the places, and the Burgesses of the Cities of his government that be of the Religion, and shall declare unto them &amp; cause them to understand the truth of the said com∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast any have uns<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>orted it to them, otherwise th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it was in deed: And shal tel them, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> under the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iralls hurt wherfore his Majestie would haue caused Iustice to be done according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the good order that he had appointed, the said Admirall and Gent. of
<PB N="35" REF="21"/> his Religion which were in the City with him; without looking for the execution of the said Ju∣stice had made a mischievous, unhappy, and detestable conspiracy against the Kings Majesties person the Queene his mother, the Lords his brethren, the King of Navarre and other Princes &amp; Lords with them, and against the whole estate even as ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taine of the chiefe and adherents of the said conspiracy (acknowledging their fault) have confessed. Wherefore his Majesty was constrained to his great griefe) to resist and prevent so mischievous pernitions, and abhomina∣ble a purpose. And that which he suffered to bee done on Sund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the 24. of August upon the Admirall and his complices, was not for any Religion nor to goe against the Edict of Pacifica∣tion he entending neverthelesse that they of the Religion should still live and abide in all liberty and safety with their wives children and families in their houses as he hath and will maintaine them if they be content to live quietly under his obedience as he desireth. For the which cause he willeth that the Counte Charnye shall offer and give to them his letters of safegard in good and authentick forme, which shall be of as good force and vertue, as if they should come to be taken from his owne Majesty: and by the authority of them, they shall be preserved from all wrongs, violences, and oppressions: enjoying and forbidding most expresly all his Catholicke Subjects whatsoever they are to attempt nothing upon the persons, goods, or families of any of the Religion which keepe themselves quietly in their houses on paine of death. And if any be so rash or evill advised, to doe against this injunction or to violate the safegard promised, his Ma∣jesty willeth that ready and rigorous punishment be done to the intent that their example may serve to hold in others not to doe the like: which is the true and onely meanes of assurance that his Majesty can give to them of the Religion, with his word and promise which hee giveth them to bee their good and benigne Prince, protector and preserver of them and of all that toucheth them, so long as they live and continue under his obedience without doing or enterpri∣sing any thing against his will and service. And because his Majesty hath often known that the enterprises and consultations taken in hand by them of the Religion against his service, have bin concluded amongst them at Assemblies, at Sermons, which Gentlemen had liberty to cause to be made in their houses and Lordships, therefore my L. of Charnye shall particularly give to understand to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entlemen which were wont to have such Sermons that his Majesty in conside∣ration that nothing hath more moved and set on the Catholicks against those of the Religion than such Preachings and Assemblies, and if they continue, it is certain that it will be a cause to encre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and maintaine the said commotions, desirerh that they should cause them to cease off untill he hath otherwise provided and appointed, and that they apply themselves hereunto as a thing greatly serving the effect of his intention, which is gently to bring his said Subjects to a true and perfect amity union and concord one with another, committing al divisions and partia∣lities to oblivion. And because this may seeme hard at the beginning my L. of Charnye shall cause it to be faire and gently spoken to them, least they enter into some strange conjecture or suspition. For so his said Majesty would proceed in all true sincerity towards them which con∣forme themselves to his will and obedience, wherein he exhorteth them to live, with all the best perswasions that he can and shall assure them in so doing to be surely maintained and preserved as his other Subjects the Catholicks, as his Majesty would that he should doe. And to the intent his said Subjects the Catholicks should know how to use and behave themselves herein my L. of Charnye shall tell them, that his Majesties pleasure neither is nor hath bin that any wrong or
<PB N="36" REF="22"/> oppression should be done to them of the said Religion, which like good and loyall Subjects will gently keepe themselves under his obedience. Declaring unto the said Catholicks, that if they forget themselves and hurt those of the Religion which in such sort behave themselves to∣ward his Majesty, and those also which for that end have received of his Majesty or of my L. of Charnye let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of safe conduct, he will cause them to be punished and chastised in the field, as transg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essors of his commandements, without any hope of grace, pardon, or remission. Which the said L. of Charnye shall expresse and declare unto them with as plaine words as is possible, and cause it also to be straightly executed. And that after following his Majesties intent, he hath pacified them by this meanes, which is the way that his Majesty best liketh of, and searched the direction to assure a tranquility betwixt the Subjects and to set some assurance betwixt the one and the other, such as shall conforme themselves herein to his said Majesties will, he will com∣fort, and make them the best and most gentle entertainement that he possibly can. But if any of the Religion become selfe willed &amp; stubborne to his Majesty, without having regard to his said warnings, and shall assemble in Armes together, making practises and devises against the weale of his service then the L. of Charnye shall run upon them and hew them in pieces before they have power to forttfie themselves and joyne together. And therefore he shall assemble as much force as he can, as well of the ordinary, as of other men of war, Souldiers, Foot-men of the Gar∣risons, and inhabitants of the Catholicks within the Cities of his Government, and shall besiege them which hold and make themselves stronge in Cities about his government, so that the victory and authority may remaine in his M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty.</P>

<HEAD>Remembrances sent by the King to all Governours, and Lieutenants of his Provinces, to put out and remove all those of the Religion from their estates and charges although they would ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure the same, saving such as have but small estates and offices, to whom his Majesty per∣mitteth continuance, on condition tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they abjure the said Religion according to the forme of Abjuration sent for that purpose.</HEAD>
<P>THe King considering how much his Officers and Magistrates of Iustice, and such as have the administration and dealing of his Fynes and payments, which be of the new Religion, are suspect and hated, and put his Catholick Subjects in great mistrust if they should presently exercise their offices after these fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h commotions for cause that the said offices be in their hands that now keep them: therefore least the people should thereby be brought to a new occasion of stir, and they of the new Religion be in danger or hazard of their owne persons, although they would abjure their said new Religion, and professe the holy faith and Catholick Religion of <HI>Rome:</HI> his Majesty desiring to avoyd the new mischiefes and troubles which may come hath advised to discharge the said officers from the exercise of the said offices, untill he shall otherwise appoint. And yet nevertheles, in the meane while, if the said officers be obedient unto his wil,
<PB N="39" REF="23"/> and live quietly in their houses, without attempting practising or mking any thing in hand a∣gainst his service, they shall receive their wages, and they that will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gne their said offices to Ca∣tholique persons and come to his Majesty shal be very honourably provided for. And as touch∣ing other small offices without wages which cannot be troublesome as Notaries Sergeants, and such where the officers have none authority, which cannot be so odious, nor mistullfull to the people, as the other, his Majesty is advised, that such small Officers which will abjure the sayd new religion, and professe the faith Catholike, Apostolike and Romish &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herin live continually hereafter, shall continue in the exercise and enjoying of their estates: but they that will continue in their new opinion, shall depart from their offices, untill his Majesty hath otherwise provided. And this is for the mischeif and inconvenience that may betide them, if they should exercise their said estates, because of the great mistrust and suspition which the Catholikes have conceived of them of the new Religion. Neverthelesse his Majestie well considering that the most part of the said officers have none other way to live, but the exercise of their said offices, willeth that they shall be in choyse to resign to Catholike and capable persons, and then to come to him for that effect, and he will grant them the greatest favour and moderation of his treasurie that is possi∣ble. The which resolution and pleasure of his Majestie he willeth to be declared to the said offi∣cers of the new pretended opinion, as wel by governors and Lievtenants generall of his Provin∣ces, as by them of his Courts of Parliament, of the chamber of his accounts, of the Court of his ayds, them of his great Counsel of the Treasury of France, the generalls of his fines his baylifs, Seneshals, Provosts, Iudges or their Lievtenants, and every one of them as shall appertain. And to this intent his Majestie willeth and intendeth that every one of them in their calling shal send particularly and apart for every of the said officers of the new Religion, which be of their in∣corporation, charge an jurisdiction and shall admonish them in this behalf t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conforme them¦selves to his Majesties minde and if any of them in authority, because of their said estates wil re∣turn to the bosome of the Catholike and Romish Church, it shall bee said to them that his Ma∣jesty liketh very wel of it &amp; that he taketh a great and singular affection therin, and it shal give him the greater assurance and credit of their good will and that his Majestie will not bar them from his service hereafter but will provide for them as their behaviour shall deserve. And not∣withstanding, for the reasons abovesaid, he willeth that they shall cease from the exercise of their estates and offices untill he otherwise appointeth And because that in many places of the Realm they have proceeded by way of ceasing the goods of them of the new Religion which be dead or absent and hide themselves: and sometimes of those which be in their own houses, although his Majestie gave to understand by his Declaration of the xxviij. of August last, that he would and intended that they of the new Religion should enjoy their goods, neverthelesse, to the intent there should be no doubt of his purpose, and that no mistrust might arise thereupon, he declareth, willeth, and intendeth again, that according to his declaration of the 28. of Au∣gust, they of the new Religion which be living whether they be present or absent, and be not cul∣pable or charged with the last conspiration, or to have attempted against his Majesty or his e∣state, since his Edict of Pacification, shalbe restored to their houses, and put in possession of all and singular their goods, moveable or unmoveable. And that the widows and heirs of them that be dead may and shall succeed them and apprehend al and singular their goods, &amp; that they shall be maintained in them and kept under the protection and safeguard of hit Majesty so that no hurt shall be done or said unto them in any manner of wise or sort. Willing for this purpose
<PB N="40" REF="24"/> that all necessary suerty shall be given them, and that all Officers, Magistrates Majors &amp; others whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have publick charge shal maintaine them in all safety forbidding all persons of what estate quality or condition so ever they bee, not to hurt them in person or goods upon paine of death. And neverthelesse his Majesty willeth, that they of the new opinion shall submit themselves and promise upon paine to be declared rebells and traitours to his Majesty, that they shall hereafter live under his obedience without attempting any thing to the contrary, or taking their parts that doe attempt against his Majesty and estate, or things against his ordinances and to acknowledge none but his Majesty, or such as he shall appoint under him to have authority to command them And if they know any that shall enterprise against his Majesty and service, to reveale them in∣continent to him and his officers, as good and faithfull subjects. And to take away all doubt and suspition as well from the Nobility as others, because that in the Declaration of the 24. of the last moneth, these words are contained <HI>(Except they be those of the chiefe, which had comman∣dement for those of the new opinion, or those which made practises and devises for them, or those which might have had intelligence of the said conspiracy.)</HI> His Majesty declareth that he mea∣neth not of things done and past during the troubles which were before the Edict of Pacifica∣tion in August. 1570. and that there shall be no inquisition thereof, and none shall be troubled in goods or person therefore (but for that respect they shall enjoy the benefit of the Edict of Pacification) but that the said words extend onely to those which bee found to be guilty or ac∣cessary to the last conspiracy done against his Majesty and estate, and that other which are im∣prisoned, shall be set at liberty. And as touching them which will make profession of their faith, and returne to the Catholick Religion, his Majesty desireth that his Governours and officers shall excite and comfort them as much as they can, to that effect, and execution of that good will: and that their friends and Kinsfolks should also be exhorted to doe the like for their part. And if any should hurt them in goods or body, his Majesty willeth ready and speedy execution to be done on them. And to the intent that they may follow the forme which hath bin kept, in professing the faith which they doe make that returne to the Apostolick and Romish Church, there is sent herewith a memory thereof.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="24"/> astray and separated my selfe since, &amp;c. and desirous to returne to the flock of Christs true sheepefold, which is the Catholike, Apostolike, and Romish Church, confesse to have Abjured and cursed all the Errours and Heresie of the Luthetians, Calvinistes, and Hugo∣notes, and all other Heresie whatsoever wherewith I have heretotore beene diffamed or touched: and I agree to the faith of our holy Mother the Church, and I desire you in the name of God, of his son Iesus Christ, and of the glorious Virgin his mother Mary, and of all the Saints of Paradice, that it would please you to receive me into the flock and sheepfold of Gods people, which live under the obedience of the Pope ordained our Saviour Jesus Christs Vicar in the said Church, submitting my selfe patiently to abide and willingly to do pennance which it shall please you to enjoyne mee for the absolution of my faults committed, whilst I was in the foresayd Sects, whereof I aske and require pardon of God, and of his said Church, and of you (that bee appoynted my Pastor by GOD the Creator) absolution with such pennauce as you shall judge to bee wholsome for the satisfaction of my sinnes and offences. And to the intent you should know that I have and doe make this abjuration from my heart, I confesse moreover before God and you, that I beleeve that which is contained in the Simbole or Creede of the Apostles, and Athanasius, and other confessions of Faith made and approved by the whole Councells of the Catholike, Apostolike, and Romish Church: that is: I beleeve in one onely God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth, and of all things vi∣sible and invisible, and in one Lord our Lord Iesus Christ, the onely son engendred by God the Father before the constitution of the world, God of God, Light of Light, true God of true God, engendred not Created, Consubstantiall with the Father by whom all things were made, who for us men, and for our salvation, descended from heaven, &amp;c. <HI>As in the beleef of Morning prayer.</HI> I beleeve likewise, acknowledge and confesse all that which is contained in the bookes as well of the olde as of the new Testament, approved by the said holy and A∣postolike Church of Rome, according to the sence and interpretation of the holy Doctors recei∣ved by the same, rejecting all other interpretation as false and erroneous. I acknowledge the seven Sacraments of the said Catholike, Apostolike and Romish Church, that they were instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, and that they bee necessarie for the Salvation of Mankinde, that all of them are not of necessity to bee conferred to all, that is to say. I confesse that the said seven Sacraments are these, <HI>Baptisme, Confirmation, Eu∣charist</HI> which is the Sacrament of the altar, <HI>Pennance, extreame Vnction, Order, and Mar∣riage,</HI> and that the said Sacraments confer grace, and that of them, Baptisme, Confirmation and Order, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or bee rei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>era<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d without Sacriledge. That the said Sacraments have the ef∣fect which the said Church teacheth, and that the forme and usage wherewith they be ministred to Christians, is holy and necessary. I acknowledge also that the holy Masse is a sacrifice and oblation of the very body and blood of our Saviour Jesus Christ under the forme of bread and wine mingled with water, which substances of bread and wine under the said former (are in the Masse by the words which serve for consecration, said and pronounced by the Priest) transubstantiated and transformed into the substance of the said body and blood of Iesus Christ. Notwithstanding, that the qualities and accidents remaine in the sayd formes after the said Consecration, and that the Masse is wholsome and profitable as well for the quicke as the dead. I acknowledge and confesse the comcomittance, that is to
<PB N="42" REF="25"/> say, that in receiving the body of Jesus Christ under the forme of bread alone, I likewise recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the bloud of Jesus Christ. I confesse that Prayer and intercession of Saints for the quick and the dead is holy, good and healthfull for Christians, and is not contrary (for any respect) to the glory of God. That prayers made in the Church for the faithfull which are dead, doe profit them for the remission of their sins, and lossening of their paines incurred for the same. That there is a Purgatory where the soules abiding are succoured by the prayers of the faithfull. I confesse that we must honour and call upon the Saints which raigne with Jesus Christ and that they make intercession for us to God, and that their Reliques are to bee worshipped. That the commandements and traditions of the Catholick, Apostolick, and Romish Church as well they which pertaine to the forme and Ceremonies of divine Service, and to assist the fame, which I thinke be to draw Christian people to pitty and turning to their God, as fasting, abstaining f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om meates observation of holy dayes, and Ecclesiasticall pollicy, according to the tradition of the Apostles and holy Fathers continued since the Primative Church till this time and after∣wards brought into the Church by the ordinances of Counsel, received in the same of long and ancient time or of late, bee good and holy, to the which I will and ought to obey as prescribed and appointed by the Holy Ghost, the Author and director of that which serveth for the kee∣ping of Christian Religion, and of the Catholick Apostolick, and Romane Church. I be∣leeve also and accept all the Articles of Originall sin, and of Justification. I affirme assuredly that wee ought to have and keepe the Images of Jesus Christ, of his holy Mother and all other Saints, and doe honour and reverende unto them. I confesse the power of indulgence and par∣dons to bee left in the Church by Jesus Christ, and the use of them to be very healthfull, as also I acknowledge and confesse the Church of Rome to bee the Mother and chiefe of all Churches, and conducted by the Holy-Ghost: and that other pretended particular inspirations against the same, come of the suggestions of the Divell, the Prince of dissention, which would seperate the union of the Mysticall body of the Saviour of the World. Finally, I promise straightly to keepe all that was ordained at the last generall Counsell of Trent, and promise to God and you, never more to depart from the Catholick, Apostolick, and Romane Church: and if I doe (which God forbid) I submit my selfe to the penalties of the Canons of the said Church, made, ordained, and appointed against them which fall back inro Apostasie. To which Abju∣ration and Confession I have subscribed.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="25"/> that according to the quality and power which they have of his Majesty they can well fol¦low and observe his intent, the which more fully to declare, his Maje<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty hath caused his Letter Patents to be dispatched, which shall be delivered them.

And afterwards he shall lovingly admonish them to continue no longer in the Er∣rour of the new opinions, and to returne to the Catholick Religion reconciling themselves to the Catholick Romish Church, under the Doctrine and obedience whereof, Kings his prede∣cessors and their Subjects have alwaies holily lived, and this Realme hath bin carefully con∣ducted and maintained: Shewing to them the mischiefes and calamities which have happened in this Realme, since these new opinions have entred into mens spirits: How many murders have beene caused by such which have fallen from the right way holden by their Ancestors. First they made them separate themselves from the Church, then from the next of Kindred, and al∣so to be estranged from the service of their King as a man may see since his raign. And although the Authors and heads of that side, would have covered their doings under the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle of Religion and conscience: yet their deeds and workes have shewen well inough that the name of Religion was but a visarde to cover their driftes and disobedience, and under that pretence to assemble and subborne people ond to make them to sweare in the cause under the title of disobedience, and by such waies to turne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem from the naturall affection which they owe to the King, and consequently from his obedience, being notorious that what commaundement soever the King could make to them of the new Religion, they have not since his raigne obeyed him otherwise then pleased their heads. And contrariwise, when their sayd heads commaunded them to arise and take to their weapons to sett upon Cities, to burne Churches, to sack and pil to trouble the Realme and fill it with bloud and fire, they which went so astray to follow them, forgott all trust and duty of good subjects, to execute and obey their commandements. Which things if the Gentlemen will consider they shal easily judge how unhappy and miserable their condition shal be if they continue therein. For they may well thinke of themselves that the King being taught by experience of so great a danger, from the which it hath pleased God to preserve him and his estate, and having proued the mischeifes and calamityes which this Realme hath fuffered by the enterprises of the heads of this cause their adherents and complices that hee willingly bee served with any Gentleman of his Subjects that bee of any other Religion than the Catholick, in the which also the King following his Predecessors, will live and dye. He willeth also to take a∣way all mistrust amongst his Subjects and to quench the rising of discords and seditions, that all they of whom he is served in honourable places, and specially the gentlemen which desire to be accompted his good and lawful Subjects &amp; would obtaine his favour &amp; be employed in charges of his service, according to their degrees and qualities, doe make profession hereafter to live in the same Religion that he doth: having tryed that discords and civill warrs will not cease in a state

For howsoever it bee, his Majesty is resolved to make his subjects live in his religion, and never to suffer whatsoever may betide, that there shall bee any other form or exercise of Religion in his Realm then the Catholike. The said D. of Guise shall communicate with the Principall officers and Magistrates, having the principall charge and administration of Iustice in Cities of his Go∣verment, his Majesties declaration to the intent they should know his mind, and the good end whereunto he tendeth for the uniting and quietnesse of his subjects, to the intent the said M. de Guise &amp; the said Officers &amp; Magistrates, should with one concord, intelligence &amp; correspond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce proceed to the effect above said, so that fruit &amp; quietnes may thereof ensue, such as his Majesty desireth not onely for himselfe, but for the whole Realme. The Bayliffes and stewardes which are not in Religion accordingly qualified, shall within one moneth resigne their office to Gen∣tlemen capable, and of the quality required by the Edict, which may keep and exercise the same. And to the intent this should be done, his Majesty doth now presently declare them deprived after the said month, if they do not then resign, that they shall have no occasion or colour of ex∣cuse to delay their resignations, and yet permitteth them in the mean while to resigne without any fine paying. All Bayliffs and Stewards shalbe resident at their offices upon paine of losse of the same, and if they cannot so be then they shalbe bound to resigne. All Archbishop and Bi∣shops shall likewise be resident in their Dioces, and such as for age and other disposition of per∣sons cannot preach the word of God, nor edifie the people, and do no other functions appertai∣ning to their charge and dignity, shall be bound to take a conductor to comfort them, &amp; to em∣ploy themselves to the duty of their charge. To the which conductor they shall appoint an ho∣nest and reasonable pension according to the fruits and revenue of their living.

<HEAD>The Answer of the Gentlemen, Captaines, Burgesses, and other being in the Towne of Ro∣chell, to the commandements that have beene given them in the name of the King, to re∣ceive Garrisons.</HEAD>
<P>WE the Gent. Capt. Burgesses and other now being in the Town of Rochel, do give an∣swer to you Monsieur N. and to such commandements as you give us in the name of his Majesty, that we cannot acknowledg that that which is signified unto us, &amp; the proclama∣tion which you require that we should cause to be published, do proceed from his Majesty. And thereof we call to witnesse his Majesty himself, his letters of the 22. &amp; 24. of August his owne signet, and the publishing of the same letters, by the which his sayd Majesty layeth all the fault of all the trouble lately happened, and of the cruell slaughter done at Paris, upon those of the house of Guise, protecting that he has enough to do to keep himselfe safe within his Castle of Louure with those of his guard. And wee shall never suffer our selves to be perswaded that so soul an enterprise and so barbarons a slaughter hath at any time entred into the mind of his Ma∣jesty, much lesse that the same hath bin done by his expresse commandement, as the paper im∣porteth which you have exhibited unto us, nor that his Majesty hath bin soill advised, as himself to cut off his own arms, or to defile the sacred wedding of madam his own sister with the shed∣ding of so much noble &amp; innocent blood &amp; with the shame of so cruell a fact to destein the na∣tion of France &amp; the blood royall which hath heretofore ever among all nations born the name of frank and courteous; nor that he hath had minde to deliver matter to any writers to set forth a tragicall history such as antiquitie hath never heard speak of the like &amp; such as po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teritie cannot report without horror. But that it was first laid at Rome, and afterward hatched at Paris, by the authors of all troubles of Fraunct. And howsoever it be, we are ready to maint ine that out of the mouth of his Majesty doth not proceed hot and cold, white and black, and that hee doth not now say one thing and by and by another, as he should if the paper that you present unto us had passed from him, protesting that he will inviolably keep his edict, and immediately brea∣king the same in declaring that he commanded those murders to be committed, hauing also m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de protestation before that it is to his great grief, and done by the outrage and violence of these of Guise against whom he was not able to make speedy resistance in time as his Majesty desired. And in this quarrell we the Gent. Captains, and other that maketh you this answer are ready to try it by combat man to man, or otherwise, to maintaine the honour of our King againg all
<PB N="46" REF="27"/> those that so prophane holy things, and as much as in them lyeth doe by such words &amp; titles vi∣lainously defile the excel encie of his Majesty and of the noble Princes of his bloud. Which we may right well conjecture and estimate, by the slaughters that are yet in doing as well in the Town of Paris as else where, upon so many noblemen, gentlemen and other, men, women and children, and upon a great number of yong Schollars (the maintenance under God, of Realms &amp; common-weales in time to come) and to many other barbarous, unnaturall and unmanly acts ge¦nerally committed. We think therefore and judge that herein treason is enterprised against the person of his Majesty and of my Lords his brethren, and that the Guisians mean to invade the Crown of the Realm as they have of long time practised, &amp; how so ever it be, we say that his Majesty is forced by the power that they have taken upon them and usurped by meane of the rebellious stir of the commons of Paris. As for rhat which they say that the Admirall and those of the Religion had conspired against the K. Majesty and his brethren, these be allegations of as great truth and of as good likelyhood, as their manner of proceeding in justice hath bin orderly, beginning at execution before examination of the fact. But it is now no need to tarry for time to discover it for the matter is plain to be seene with eye and groped with hand and all those of the Romish Religion that have remaining any drop of nature of man, doe confesse it and hold down their heads for shame cursing both with heart and mouth the cruell executors of this abhomina∣ble enterprise and the wicked disturbers of common quiet, which can yet no more suffer, than they hetherto have done that this poore Realm should long enjoy the benefit of that peace, which the King alone next under God, had wisely caused to be made and to bee accordingly observed, whereof this realm began to feele the good taste, to the great contentment of all persons, except the enemies of peace and of this realm, namely the Guisians. Finally, when his Majesty being out of their hands and power shall declare what is his pleasure, we will endeavour to obey him in all things, wherein our consciences, which are dedicate to God alone, shall not be wounded, in which case we will rather forsake the earth than Heaven, and our fraile and transitory houses rather than the heavenly Mansions. <HI>But hitherto the law of Nature, and the duty that we owe to our naturall Prince, to the preservation of his Crown, and to the safety of our lives, our w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and children doth command us to stand upon our Guard and not to put it in the mercy of those that have received the same bloudy Commission from the Guisians under the pretended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame of the King, to use us in the same manner as they have wickedly, traiterously &amp; unnaturally done to those about his Majesty, and as it were under his wings, and under the skirts of his robe, which the traitours stranger have stained with the true French bloud, without that his Majesty had bin able to remedy it, nor to stay their cursed attempts: so much lesse is he able now so far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e off to defend us as he would, which his Majesties good will being knowne unto us, doth arme us for our defence, and for the safegard of our lives, and of the priviledges which he hath given us, untill such time as he shall be able by himselfe to defend us against his enemies and ours.</HI></P>
