<HEAD>A
STEP
TO THE
BATH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Town, and its Diversions, being grown as Stale as a Cast-off
Mistress; and the chiefest of its Inhabitants withdrawn to their Ru∣ral
Pleasures; and Duns as Impudent as <HI>D</HI>—the <HI>Poulterian Officer:</HI>
So that being Bereav'd of the one, and damnably Fatigu'd by the other;
Necessity, the Mother of Invention, oblig'd me to take a Country
Journey, for Self-preservation sake; having Money to <HI>Spend,</HI> tho' none
to <HI>Pay.</HI> And the last Summers Expedition at the <HI>Wells,</HI> not agreeing with my pre∣sent
Constitution, and my Inclinations being bent after Novelties, I resolv'd to Steer
my Course <HI>Westward,</HI> to see what Pleasure those <HI>Pools of Iniquity,</HI> call'd the <HI>BATH,</HI>
would afford me. In order for which, I presently took Hack, and bid him drive
me to that terrible Sign the <HI>Sarazens-Head</HI> in <HI>Friday-street,</HI> where I gave Earnest for
a Place in the following <HI>Mondays</HI> Coach; but being <HI>Saturday,</HI> and late in the Season,
I thought I should have no reason to Curse my Company, for mine was the first that
was taken: But my Tun-Belly'd Hostess, to Encourage me, said, <HI>That notwithstan∣ding
'twas so late in the Week, she doubted not but there would be more Places taken before
Night.</HI></P>
<P>In hopes of which, I left her to prepare for my approaching Journey; and Money
being the Life of the Cause, I muster'd up a pretty tolerable Sum, and for conve∣niency
of Carriage, converted it into the Noblest of Metals. Then I began to think
of the Redemption of several Captivated Necessaries, which an Unlucky Accident
had brought into Bondage; as an <HI>Vltramarine Ioseph,</HI> a Pocket Monitor of <HI>Tompion</HI>'s
Composing, and a Silver Hilted <HI>Ripp</HI> of the <HI>Isebrook</HI>'s Temper; three as necessary
Implements for a <HI>Traveller,</HI> as <HI>Goose, Yard,</HI> and <HI>Sheers,</HI> for a <HI>Taylor.</HI> Well, to <HI>Egypt</HI> I
went, and Redeem'd them from Slavery.</P>
<P>And by reason I would be ready on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, I went to Lye at the Inn on
<HI>Sunday</HI> Night; and Enquiring of the Tapster what Company I was like to have, he
said more he believ'd than I desir'd; for there was four Places taken just after I went,
and three of the Passengers were in the House, and to Lye there that Night; the o∣ther
was for a Merchant of <HI>Bristol.</HI> Then asking what those in the House were, he
told me two Gentlewomen and their Maid Servant, who were just going to Supper.
Whereupon I bid him go and give my Service to 'em, and tell 'em I was to Travel
with 'em to Morrow, and should take it as a great favour, if they would please to
Honour me so far, as to admit me into their Company, for I was alone. The Fellow
brought word they desir'd me to walk in, and they should be very glad of mine.
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
This being what I wanted, in I went; and after a few Ceremonial Complements,
and begging pardon for my Rudeness, I told them I was afraid I should have gone
alone, but now I found I should be Bless'd beyond my Hopes, in having the Ho∣nour,
or rather Happiness, of their good Company. <HI>I wish, Sir,</HI> reply'd one of 'em,
<HI>it may answer your expectation, for our Sex is counted but very indifferent Company to Tra∣vel
with, and you are like to be Fatigu'd with three of us.</HI> As for Children, and Testy
Age, Madam, answer'd I, I agree in the Opinion; but otherwise, condemn it as
Erroneous: And for your Number, The More the Merrier. <HI>That's according as it
proves, Sir,</HI> said she; <HI>neither would I have you Flatter your self too soon, least your hopes
should prove abortive, but rather referr you to old</HI> Saffold'<HI>s Advice,</HI> Read, Try, Judge,
and speak as you find. I must confess, Madam, answer'd I, Experience is the only
Touch-stone; but I shall be mightily deceiv'd in my Politicks, if it does not make
good my Assertion. <HI>I Presume, Sir,</HI> said the other Lady, <HI>You have Studyed</HI> Saunders,
<HI>and are well Vers'd in</HI> Physiognomy, <HI>or you could never pretend to so much Fore-knowledge.</HI>
At which I Crav'd the Honour of seeing her Hand, telling her, I had some little Skill
in <HI>Palmestry,</HI> by which Art I perceiv'd she requir'd not much Castration; which made
them both Laugh: And the first Lady ask'd me, if I had any Skill in <HI>Chiromancy,</HI> for
the same Author Profest both. I told her no; but was satisfied she had; for her
Charms had rais'd such a Spirit in me, that I knew not how to lay it without her
Assistance. <HI>I never understood</HI> Magick, <HI>I Protest, Sir,</HI> reply'd she, <HI>and am mightily
afraid of a Spirit: Therefore let's Discourse no more of such Vnruly things, that neither of
us know how to Govern.</HI> Your Power is as absolute in Laying as in Raising of them,
Lady, answer'd I; but since 'tis your Pleasure, your Command shall be Obey'd, and
I'll Shape my Discourse to what Subject you Please.</P>
<P>But Supper coming in, they desir'd me to sit down with them, and having more
Manners than to refuse so good a Proffer, I comply'd with their Request, and fed
very Heartily. The Glass went Briskly about, that we were as Merry, as a knot of
joval Tinkers over a Cup of Nappy-Ale, and I began to like my Company extraor∣dinary
well; but the Charming Inchantress and I, interchang'd so many learing Ogles,
that I could hardly mind our Discourse; Yet I understood so much, that she was a
<HI>Widdow,</HI> the other a <HI>Wife,</HI> and both Sisters, and also Strangers to the Place they were
going to, as well as I; and had no other Call but Recreation; But I was for fulfil∣ling
the Scriptures, in comforting the <HI>Widdow.</HI> Supper being ended, they call'd for
a Bill, which was presently brought; out I lugg'd, and was going to Discharge, but
they begg'd my Pardon, and would by no means suffer me; telling me I must sub∣mit
to the Rule that is generally observ'd in Travelling, for the <HI>Major</HI> of either
Sex to Treat the <HI>Minor.</HI> I must Acknowledge, Ladies, said I, 'tis an Old Custome
so to do, but we are not now on the Road; however that Avail'd not, they pleaded the
Prerogative of the Majority, and carry'd it <HI>Nolens Volens.</HI> Seeing they were so Re∣solute,
I dispenc'd with the Affront, considering I had often put up a greater, and
would not press too hard least it should prevail; but that was a needless Thought,
for the Young Widdow drew from between her Snowy Breasts, a Purse Cramm'd as
full of <HI>Yellow-Boys,</HI> as a Clerk of a Markets Bag of <HI>Copper Iohn</HI>'s, and Discharg'd
the whole. Seeing of which, I thought I could do no less in Honour than call for my
Flask; Craving Leave to present them with it as my Foy; and being a little
Elevated with the Noble Juice, we were as jocund and frollicksome, as a Countrey-Vicar
at a Gossiping. In came the Wine, without Disputing who should pay for it;
but at last, Night, the Lovers Bliss, and Bane of good Company, Oblig'd us to with∣draw
to our Chambers. Upon which, I told the Ladies, I should think the time ve∣ry
tedious till I should be so happy as to Enjoy their good Company again. <HI>We are
apter to believe Sir,</HI> answered they, <HI>you will think the Iourney so, by reason of the Dull∣ness
of it.</HI> Say what I will, Ladies, said I, you Foy'l me with my own Weapons, and
are pleas'd to retort my Words to their own Centre. So after a profound Cringe
or two, with a Gripe of the Paw, and as many Amorous Glances at my Charming
Widdow, who return'd me the like, we parted: But never any happy Bridegroom
Long'd for the Approaching Night, more than I for the succeeding Morning.</P>
<P>No sooner had I enter'd my Chamber, but I found a Secret Passion had possest my
Soul, and I was all on Fire: Ye Powers, cry'd I, what strange Fever's this that Rages
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
in my Breast, and Riots in my Blood? Not Liquid Fire by its first Cause Fomented,
burns Fiercer in Earths Center, than I flame within. Tame this Unruly Flame, or
touch her Heart that first Kindl'd it, with a Cole from the same Altar. Nay 'tis
impossible to relate how violent my Passion rag'd; but in Love I was, that's certain;
but whether her Purse or Person begat this Flame, is a very Nice Question, and I pro∣test
I know not; for, as Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> says,
<Q><L>Gold alone does Passion move,</L>
<L>Gold Monopolizes Love.</L></Q></P>
<P>For Gold has Unresistable Charms as well as Beauty; is of a Corroding Quality;
of an Attractive Nature, and bears a great influence o'er the Opticks. And 'twas
very probable that Purse was only Prologue to a far greater Sum; so by consequence
must needs have some Operation; not but the Ladies were both very Amiable, in
the Bloom of Vigorous Youth, bore a good Aspect, had no mean Air, Free, and
without Reserve in their Conversation; and their Deportment declar'd them of
no Vulgar Quality. But the Charming Golden Widow was the Idol of my Soul,
Subject of my Thoughts, and Center of my Wishes; Musing on whom, at last dull
<HI>Morpheus</HI> Seal'd my Eyes, to relieve my Captivated Senses.
<Q><L>But, Oh ye Gods! no Rest could I obtain,</L>
<L>The Charming Fair did o'er my Slumbers Reign;</L>
<L>And in strange Dreams Augment my Rapid Flame.</L></Q></P>
<P>By that time Forked <HI>Cynthia</HI> had withdrawn her influence, and bright <HI>Aurora</HI>
rose from <HI>Thetis</HI> Lap, I shook off the Drowsy God, and blest the joyful Day. Looking
out of my Window I perceiv'd they were preparing for our Journey, which made
me Rig with all imaginable speed; and as I was going down, who should I meet but my
Cherubimical Widow, equip'd like a Goddess, and Adorn'd with Ribbon like the
Fore-Horse of a Country-Team? After we had given each other the Time of the
Day, <HI>Lord Sir,</HI> said she, <HI>are you but just up? Why we are almost Ready to go; Certainly
you Slept very Sound.</HI> No Madam, answered I, since I have had the Happiness of see-you,
Rest has been a Stranger to my Brest. <HI>Have I disturb'd you Sir,</HI> said she? <HI>If so, I
ask your Pardon, and am sorry for it.</HI> Ye Gods, cry'd I, what shall I say? Or how shall
I express my self? Inspire my Tongue with Eloquence, thou God of Love, to make
her sensible of my pain. Oh Madam, cry'd I, you are Innocent of your Crime, and
guilty of the Fact: You have Robb'd me of my Rest, Fir'd my Blood, and Stolen my
Heart; see how it Hovers o'er your Panting Breast, and fain would gain Admittance.
<HI>I Vow Sir,</HI> answered she, <HI>your Discourse is so Mysterious, that it wants another</HI> Oedipus
<HI>to unfold. And for what you are pleas'd to charge me withal, is a false Accusation; nei∣ther
have I Vacancy to Entertain it.</HI> Ah Madam, reply'd I, I could soon convince you
of your Error, if you would give me leave to search in a certain Corner you have
about you that shall be Nameless. At which she Blush'd, and told me I was mightily
Mistaken: But allow it so, since 'twas Ignorantly committed, and without any preme∣ditated
design, she hop'd I would be so generous as to Forgive her. Never Madam,
said I, unless you vouchsafe to cast an Eye of Pity, and Commiserate the Condition
of your Languishing Lover, on whom the God of Love, if there be any such a Deity,
hath Empty'd his whole Artillery, and pierc'd my Heart with your all-Conquering
Eyes: <HI>O Fye, Sir,</HI> answer'd she, <HI>this is meer Railery, and only for your Diversion, a thing
Customary with you General Lovers, in whom every New Face Creates a new Flame; of the
Libertines Opinion, that a Woman, after she is once enjoy'd, grows Dull and Insipid; and what
you have now so solemnly pretended to me, is no more then you have already done to half our
Sex, if possible; and such I take it.</HI></P>
<P>By my Soul I thought she was a Witch by her guessing so right, and was a going
to tell her so, for every Syllable she utter'd was as true as an Oracle. But finding
by her Parlying I had made a Breach, I resolv'd to Storm the Castle. If you Har∣bour
any such thought of me, Madam, answer'd I, by Heaven you do me wrong;
for so pure is my Flame, and so Assiduous my Passion, without you give me speedy
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
hopes, I shall fall a Sacrifice to your disdain, and <HI>Phoenix</HI>-like, expire in my own
Flames. <HI>'Tis but Breathing a V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in Sir,</HI> answer'd she, <HI>and your Feaver will soon abate.</HI> Oh
Madam, cry'd I, how can you be so Cruel? You gave the Wound, but Administer
a contrary Cure. Wrack me no longer thus with Doubts and Fears, either retalli∣ate
me in the same Nature, or pronounce my Doom; for on your Lips my Fate de∣pends.
<HI>Indeed Sir,</HI> answer'd she, <HI>that requires more Consideration than the time will ad∣mit
of now: Yet take this for your Satisfaction, if your Character and Quality answers your
Appearance, and your Passion be real, you need not dispond of the Entertainment of that Trifle
you are pleased to Charge me withal, but it shall find a Reception Suitable to its merits.</HI> At
which she Sigh'd, and said our Company waited for us, but in the Evening would
take an Opportunity to discourse further of it. Now Madam, you have raised my
drooping Spirits to an Extacy of joy, answered I, Pardon my Presumption, and Ab∣rupt
proceeding I beseech you, in taking this opportunity to reveal my Passion, and
impute it to nothing but Love, Almighty Love, for what will not a sinking Wretch
catch hold on to save his Miserable Life?</P>
<P>At which we separated, and joyn'd our Company, who were preparing for an An∣tidote
against Fasting, which we had scarcely compleated, but were call'd on to
Board our Leathern-Conveniency, and were pen'd up like the Beasts in the Ark; but
I took care to have my Mistress my Opposite; and being settled, <HI>Whip</HI> proceeded on
his Journey, and having a plentiful Mornings Draught, Tickled his Cattel, drove like
<HI>Iehu,</HI> and soon convey'd us to the Sign of <HI>Englands Champion</HI> at <HI>Cole-brook,</HI> an Inn
famous for an Hostess, and Extravagant Bills for short Commons.</P>
<P>Having refresh'd our selves with a good Breakfast, we re-enter'd our Coop,
and was but very indifferent Company, for our <HI>Masculine</HI> Traveller, the Married
Lady, and Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> the Chamber-Maid, had a Long Game at Noddy: However it
presented me with several Opportunities of Saluting my Widdow, and Exercise
abundance of Palm Letchery; but being come to <HI>Reading,</HI> we Din'd at the <HI>Cano∣nical.
Nabb,</HI> where our Landlord was as Remarkable for his Bulk, as our late Hostess
for her Tail; formerly he was a profest Baptist, but being chosen one of the Head
Loobies of the Corporation, he renounc'd his Religion, Embrac'd the Faith, and was
Christned <HI>Lumpus;</HI> his Corps is of the size of a <HI>Rhinoceros,</HI> Measures full three Yards
in the Waste, and his Legs bigger about than the Piers of the Town Bridge, the
Doctor of the Parish hath excommunicated him from the Church; because his Snoaring
not only drowns his Voice, but disturbs the whole Congregation. Being depriv'd
of the Church, he then took to the Flesh, and is reported to have overlaid three of
his Servants. Having now stock'd our selves with Substantial Belly-Timber, and Li∣quor'd
our Whistles, we pursued our Journey, and were more Sociable; the Ladies
oblig'd us with several Songs, which they perform'd with an Excellent Voice, and
good Judgment: But my Thoughts was chiefly Ruminating on the Fair Object be∣fore
me, and how to manage my Amour at Night, every fresh Glance discovered
concealed Beauties, nor was she unsensible of my Anguish, for her repeated Sighs be∣tray'd
her yielding Heart.
<Q><L>Oh what Coelestial Motion had her Eyes!</L>
<L>Her Panting Breasts, how they did fall and rise!</L>
<L>Conspiring both to fall my Sacrifice.</L></Q></P>
<P>And our Merchant took Notice of her Sighs, and asked her the Reason, she told
him 'twas only a Foolish Custome; but I believe had he ask'd me, I could have given
him a better Account. But come, Fellow-Travellers, said he, will you please to take
a Dram of Right Nants? A good Cordial on the Road, and will digest our Dinner,
I protest I forgot it in the Morning: So we accepted of his kindness, and drain'd his
Bottle: but promised to recruit it the first opportunity; and to pass the time a∣way,
we engag'd Mrs. <HI>Pert</HI> to sing a Song, and our Merchant and I promis'd to tell a
Story: She pleaded she could not Sing, but would oblige us in relating a very strange
Accident lately discover'd; which was as followeth.</P>
<P>About fifteen Year since, There was a Noted Tradesman near <HI>Aldgate,</HI> had two Chil∣dren,
a Son and Daughter, the Son was Aged about fifteen Years, and the Daughter
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
twelve, he had a desire to put his Son Prentice to some good Trade in the City, and
gave him his choice, but he was very much Averse to it, his Inclinations being
altogether for the Sea, and nothing would serve him but a <HI>Tarpaulin</HI> Master. At last
his Father with much Regret Consented to it, and put him to a Master of a Ship
that was bound for a Trading Voyage up the <HI>Streights:</HI> At which the Young Man
was Extraordinary Glad, took Leave of his Friends, and went Aboard with great
Joy, but before three Months was Expir'd, News arriv'd that they were ta∣ken
by the <HI>Algerines,</HI> from whom at that time there was no Redemption: The News
of which, and a Considerable Loss the Old Man had lately Sustain'd by Fire, not
only Reduc'd his Condition to a mean Subsistance, but broke his Heart, nor did his
Wife long Survive him; and with the remains of their decay'd Fortune, the Poor
<HI>Orphan</HI> was put to a Sempstriss, but before her time was Expir'd, one of <HI>Exeter</HI> fell
in Love with her, Marryed her, and took her with him to <HI>Exon,</HI> unknown to her
Friends or Acquaintance; in a few Years after he left her a Widow, no Children, and
but little to Trust to; which to improve, she set up her Trade, and Maintain'd
her self very Handsomely, Living in good Credit; but her Unhappy Brother,
who had the Misfortune to be a Slave, was bought by one that Liv'd several
Leagues up in the Country, never having any Opportunity of sending to <HI>England,</HI>
his Friends dispair'd of ever seeing him again, and gave him over for Lost. But
see how Providence Order'd it, his Master Dyed, and by reason he had been a good
Servant, not only Bequeath'd him his Liberty, but also a great Sum of Money to
Maintain him; and his Mistress who had often given him several Evident Testimo∣nies
of her Affections, wou'd have Married him, provided he would Renounce his
Religion, and Embrace the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> which he deny'd to do; but her Love was
so Violent, or rather Lust so Raging, that it o'ver flow'd the Bounds of Modesty,
and by the Allurements of her Gold, intic'd him to satisfie her Exorbitant Desires,
by which means he had gotten a very Considerable Estate. But the Natural Incli∣nation
for his own Native Country, and great Desire to see his Friends, out-ballanc'd
the Embraces of his Mistress, whose Gold was more prevailing than her Charms,
and came the first Opportunity for <HI>England,</HI> and in a short time Arriv'd at <HI>Plymouth,</HI>
the next day reach'd <HI>Exon;</HI> and having present occasion for some Linnen, he
Accidentally goes into his Unknown Sisters Shop and furnish'd himself, then posts
for <HI>London;</HI> where to his great Grief he found as I have already Related, and by no
means could get any Information of his Sister, his long Absence not only bereav'd
him of his Friends, but also of all his former Acquaintance; that he was become
an <HI>Alien</HI> in the Place of his Nativity. The Deprivation of which, was an extra∣ordinary
Trouble to him, and the only way to Redress it, he thought would be
to Alter his Condition; he Coveted not Riches, but Content, to Compensate for
his hard Fate. But, Oh, how often are we Deceiv'd in our Expectations, and our
hopes Frustrated by an All-Seeing Power? His Fancy presented none so Charming
to his Eyes as the <HI>Exeter</HI> Widdow: Nay, so great was his Passion, that immediately
he goes down, Courts her, and in a short time Married her, brings her up to
<HI>London,</HI> takes a House, and Liv'd very Happily together, had two Children by
her; and no Discourse as yet of their Parents happened between them. But see how
Fate Ordain'd it! Not long since, as he was Walking by <HI>Fleet-Ditch,</HI> he Espies his
Fathers Picture Expos'd to Sale among Old Goods; which presently he Bought, and
made a very strict Enquiry where they had it, thinking thereby to trace his Sister, but
'twas so long since they bought it, that they could give him no Account; however
he Imputed it to be a very Lucky Accident, had it brought home with him, and
with abundance of Joy shows it his Wife. Telling her, 'twas the Picture of his Fa∣ther,
and how Accidentally he came by it: At which, she was mightily surpris'd,
and told him, <HI>If that was the Picture of his Father, (which Heaven forbid) she was his
own Natural Sister:</HI> He Astonish'd at this dreadful News, ask'd her a few more
questions, she Resolving of which, Confirm'd the Discovery, and hath Involv'd them
into a great deal of Trouble and Consternation of Mind; for the Easement of which
they have had the Opinion of several Learned Divines; who Advise them to joyn
no more in their incestuous Bed, but Live after the Natural Bonds of Affinity, and
since 'twas Ignorantly Committed, it mitigated the Crime, and they were more to be
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
Pittyed, and none could be so Barbarous, as to reflect on their Unhappy Off-Spring.
But 'tis to be Fear'd, it will prove Fatal to them both, for they Labour under an
Agony of Mind, that nothing but Death or Distraction is Expected.</P>
<P>Her Story being Ended, the Ladies Confirm'd it, and declar'd they knew the Par∣ties;
and it had not been Discover'd above two or three Years; but while we were
Commiserating their hard Fate, we came to a Vilage call'd <HI>Theal,</HI> and Stopt at Old
<HI>Mother Cleanly</HI>'s, at the Sign of the <HI>Divine Clamour;</HI> as Noted a House for Bottle-Ale
and Plumb-Cakes, as the Folly on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> for Bad Wine, and Lewd
Whores: Nay, <HI>Slash</HI> declar'd he dares no more pass by without calling, than the
Forked Animals miss <HI>Cuckold's-Point,</HI> in their Journey to <HI>Horn-Fair:</HI> But having
participated, and given our Approbation on her Commodity, we Travel'd on, and
our <HI>Bristol</HI> Merchant told us, he presum'd, we were a going to the <HI>BATH</HI> for
Diversion; but his Journey to <HI>London</HI> was such a Novelty, that 'twas scarce to be
Parallel'd, and Notwithstanding it had occasion'd him a great deal of Trouble, it
might Divert us; with that we desir'd him to Relate it, which he presently did, after
this manner:</P>
<P>The Place of my Habitation you already know, of which I have been a Merchant
almost this thirty year, am a Widower and have several Children, but my Eldest
Son being very Desirous to Live at <HI>London,</HI> I put him to an Eminent Draper in <HI>C—,</HI>
but before he had Serv'd half his Time, he kept such high Company, and was Ac∣quainted
with so many Rakes of the Town, that his Master was as weary of him,
as he of his Master; so I was oblig'd to take him Home, and Design'd to bring
him up a Merchant, but the Infection he receiv'd at <HI>London,</HI> made too great an
Impression to be Discharg'd by my Documents, which often occasion'd no small differ∣ence
between us; about a Month since, having some very Urgent Business in <HI>Wales,</HI>
which requir'd my Absence for at least twelve or fourteen Days, I left my Daughter
to mannage my Domestick, and he my other Affairs, and took my Journey; but that
Night I left him, he sends Word to all my Correspondents at <HI>London,</HI> that I was
Dead, (as I understand since) and that he should be with them in a short time, for his
Father having left him a Plentiful Estate, he design'd to leave off Merchandizing.
This News Startl'd my Acquaintance, and they sent him several Letters of Con∣dollence;
and my Death past as Currant on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> as if it had been sworn by
twenty <HI>Irish</HI> Witnesses. My Daughter who kept my Cash, sent him a Letter of Ad∣vice,
of the Payment of some Bills, I had lately drawn on him, which he receiv'd
and answer'd; he also intercepted the Letters I sent his Sister, and about six days
before I came Home, takes fifty Pound of my House Cash and posts for <HI>London,</HI> and
before he Appeared Publick, Cloths himself in deep Mourning, Visits my Corre∣spondents,
tells them he came to Administer to his Fathers Will, and Ballance Ac∣counts,
and takes up of my Goldsmith 1300 <HI>l.</HI> who pay'd it him all in Gold, as he re∣quested;
having Accomplish'd his Ends, Cast off his Mourning, New Rigg'd, and
now I hear is gone for <HI>Rome,</HI> to assist at the <HI>Iubilee;</HI> but when I came home, mis∣sing
of him and my Money, I presently Conjectur'd he was gone for <HI>London,</HI> and
was afraid he would take up more, therefore made all the speed I could after him,
to prevent it, but he was too Nimble for me; my Acquaintance was all possest with
a Pannick Fear, and so surpriz'd, that they took me for a Spirit, and wou'd hardly
believe their own Eyes, but I soon Convinc'd them of their Mistake, and they me
of my Sons Proceedings.</P>
<P><HI>And this Generally the Product of sending our Children to</HI> London: <HI>Well, had
I forty, I'd never send any of them to</HI> London <HI>again: Now he is gone Loaded with
Gold to</HI> Rome; <HI>Perhaps, about a Year or two hence, I shall have him return, as</HI> Light
<HI>as a</HI> Common Strumpet, <HI>as</HI> Shabby <HI>as a</HI> Broken Officer, <HI>and as</HI> Foppish <HI>as a</HI> City Beau; <HI>but
I will never Look on him again. Make no Rash Vow, however, Sir, said I, least
you Repent it; (for Nature will prevail) he may Return a very Accomplish'd Gen∣tleman,
for Travelling conduces much to Education.</HI> Yes, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> As going to
the Dancing-School, does young Wenches, who if they have but a little Money are presently
Catch'd up by some Hopping Coxcomb or another, that hath nothing to Trust to, but a Pair
of Rotting Shanks, which are scarce able to support his Wavering Carcase. I find Sir, <HI>reply'd
one of the Ladys,</HI> You have a great Aversion to <HI>London</HI> Education, and the very
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
Thoughts of it gives you the Spleen? Pray, what is the BATH for a Nursery? For during
the Season, that is a Place of great Resort. Why, <HI>answer'd he,</HI> That's out of the <HI>Frying-Pan</HI>
into the <HI>Fire,</HI> and as Eminent for <HI>Wickedness</HI> as <HI>London,</HI> 'Bating <HI>its Magnitude.</HI> With
that, I told him, I perceiv'd he Harbour'd no better Opinion of the Tuition of his own Coun∣try,
than of our <HI>Metropolian Seminary;</HI> and my Story would but Augment his Disgust.</P>
<P>Now being got to the end of our Stage for that Day, we referr'd mine for the next,
and <HI>Newbury</HI> was as wellcome to us, as <HI>Michalemas</HI> Term to the Bauling <HI>Quill-dri∣vers,</HI>
after the <HI>Long Vacation:</HI> Our Quarters was at the <HI>King of Beasts,</HI> and after we
had Saluted our Ladies, and bid them Wellcome to <HI>Newbury,</HI> we View'd our Cham∣bers,
gave Order for our Supper, and Refresh'd our selves with a Glass of good <HI>Bur∣gundy;</HI>
and having some spare time, our Merchant went to Visit a Friend in Town,
and I gave the Ladies an Invitation to take a Walk, which my Mistress was will∣ing
to, but her Sister, being something indisposed after her Journey, desir'd to be ex∣cus'd;
and as Good-Luck would have it, the Maid was oblig'd to stay with her: So
my Charming Widow, after she had dismantled herself of her Riding Accouter∣ments,
and I Augmented the weight of my Bush, by almost half a Pound of Powder,
was ready to March; our Landlord understanding we were dispos'd for a Walk,
Convey'd us out at his Back-gate, where we found a most delicate <HI>Grotto</HI> of Nature's,
not Art's Composing, half inviron'd with a Murm'ring Brook whose purling streams
Created a most Melodious Harmony, and the whole Composure seem'd a Second
<HI>Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>Having walk'd a turn or two, I thought it convenient to put my Widow in
mind of her Promise. Pardon my Presumption, Madam, said I, in taking the bold∣ness,
to put you in mind of this Mornings Conclusion, for no fitter opportunity than
now can present it self; here we are retir'd, and the place seems to be dedicated for the
same purpose. <HI>Sir,</HI> answer'd she, <HI>how can I be assur'd your Passion is real, since your Ac∣quaintance
is so slender, in which if I should be deceiv'd, how shall I be Ridicul'd by the Cen∣sorious
World?</HI> I presume not, Madam, reply'd I, to lay any Claim of meriting your
Esteem, as to the Quality of my Person; nor yet am I so despiseable in my Descent or
Fortune, to incur your disdain. But Love, Almighty Love, who knows no
Bounds or Equals, is my Plea; and notwithstanding my Love is of so late a Date,
it is as pure as Vestals Flames, and firm as Fate, and all my pretensions Ho∣nourable.
<HI>If so, Sir,</HI> said she, <HI>I do Agnize your Passion, and return you mine; for Blush∣ing
I must own it, when first I saw your Face, an unusual Flame seiz'd my Heart and kind∣led
in my Breast Vnknown Desires.</HI> At this Confession I flung my circling Arms about
her Lovely Wast, and almost stiffled her with Kisses. What then remains, cry'd
I, my Life, my Soul, but to Quench our Desires, and delay our Bliss no longer? At
which she started back, and told me she thought, or she was much Mistaken, before
she reveal'd her Passion, I declar'd I design'd nothing but what was Honourable; if
so, what means this unruly Proceeding? Onely the extream Ardour of my Flame,
my Dear, answer'd I; for who can behold the Tempting Tree, and forbear to pluck
its luscious Fruit? <HI>Not till the Priest hath made it Lawful, Sir,</HI> said she, <HI>for Fear,—Oh, for
Fear.</HI>—By Heaven, and all that's Sacred, Madam, cry'd I, those Fears are Needless;
for sooner shall the Silver Morn forget to dawn, the Glorious Sun to steer its course,
than I prove false to you. What then should hinder us now, from Satisfying our
Craving Appetites, before the Sluggish Priest hath Crav'd a Blessing. At which,
she sunk into my Arms, and by her Dying Eyes gave her Consent; then calling
to mind the Alacrity to be us'd in Courting a Widdow, and that now might be the
Crittical Minute, I lay'd her down on Nature's Carpet, and made bold with Mother
Earth for a Boulster; and notwithstanding all her faint Resistance, rifled her joys, roving
through all the hidden Labyrinth of Love, and by our Mutual Embraces Quench'd
our fierce Desires, then Coo'd and Bill'd like a pair of Amorous Doves, swearing E∣ternal
Constancy afresh, and to tye the Gordian knot the first opportunity.</P>
<P>But in our Discourse I took an occasion to make a scrutiny into her Affairs, that
I might understand what Bargain I was like to have, if I perform'd my Promise. She
told me she had been a Widow near two years, had no Child, was worth 3000l▪
and liv'd with her Sister, who was Married to a Gentleman near <HI>Hackney;</HI> and liv∣ing
so far off, was the reason they lay at the Inn last Night. This News methought
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
Augmented her Charms, and having enjoy'd the Shadow, I hop'd in a short time to
reap the Golden Substance. Having out-staid our time, a Messenger came to Desire
us to make haste, for our Company and Supper waited for us: But when we came,
and had given them an Account of our pleasant walk, and Description of the De∣lightful
Grove, (but not a word of the Paradise of Love) they seem'd to be sorry
they did not go along with us (that neither of us was, I am certain.) Having Supt, they
brought us a Bill, which was as reasonable as a Reckoning at a <HI>Hosier-lane</HI> Bawdy-House
during <HI>Bartholomew-Fair;</HI> for a Brace of Midling Trouts, they charg'd us but
a Lease of Crowns, Six Shillings for a Shoulder of <HI>Mutton</HI> and a Plate of <HI>Gerkins,</HI>
three and Sixpence for Six <HI>Rowles,</HI> and three Nipperkins of <HI>Belch;</HI> and two Shillings
more for <HI>Whip</HI> in Drinking our Healths. Their Wine indeed was good, so was their
price; and in a Bill of two pound four Shillings, they made a Mistake but of Nine; I
ask'd what Countrey-man my Landlord was? answer was made, Full <HI>North;</HI> and Faith
'twas very Evident, for he had put the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> most Damnably upon us. But being
to rise very Early, we went to Bed soon after we had Supt; and was called by Break
of Day, my Widow presented us with a Pot of <HI>Chocolat</HI> of her own Preparing;
and filling my Dishes fuller than ordinary, I Conjectur'd 'twas for my good Perfor∣mances,
dasht with a little self-interest; after which we recruited our Bottle, and re∣new'd
our Journey; but I marked his Gate with a Cross as red as the Sign. And
before we had Travel'd a Mile, the Ladies laid claim to my promise to relate my Story,
which I was oblig'd to perform, and was thus.</P>
<P>There was a very Eminent Shopkeeper in <HI>Westminster,</HI> had the misfortune to
have a very Extravagant Son, who by his Continual Profuseness, Consum'd him
a great many Baggs of a certain Commodity much better then <HI>Cherry-Stones;</HI> he
was not only very Indulgent to him, but Maintain'd his Family; he being of a
Roving Mind, could not Confine himself to Business, but went from his Father and
Family, chang'd his Name, and <HI>Rak'd</HI> about the Town; but by Accident got Ac∣quainted
with two Young Women, who kept Shop on the <HI>Royal-Exchange;</HI> the youn∣gest
of them he Courted for a Wife, and in a short time Married her, made an Ex∣traordinary
Figure, and as Mighty Pretences; but he had not Enjoy'd her long be∣fore
'twas Discover'd, and he Oblig'd to Live with his First, who was no ways de∣serving
of such an Unkind Action; but rather Worthier of a better Husband;
and being ask'd the Reason, why he would offer to Commit <HI>Poligamy?</HI> He an∣swer'd,
<HI>Though Plurality of</HI> Caesars <HI>was not Safe for a</HI> State, <HI>Plurality of</HI> Wives <HI>could
be no</HI> Crime.</P>
<P>But the Poor Young Woman was very much Disappointed; all her hopes Blasted,
and her Promising Imaginations prov'd Vain Chimera's. For he in a little time
after abandon'd both, and took a Trip to <HI>Iamaica,</HI> where in three Months he Married
a Rich Widow, worth at least 7000l. <HI>Sterling,</HI> and before three years was Com∣pleated,
she made her <HI>Exit;</HI> which he esteem'd to be the Happyest Day in all his Life,
the result of all his hopes, and the only mark he aim'd at. Now being Master of a
Plentiful Estate, he soon Converted it into the Commodity of the Country, and Sail'd
for <HI>England,</HI> with a Joyful Heart, and Prosperous Gale; and upon his Arrival at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
found himself a double Widower, and his <HI>Exchange</HI> Wife Married to a <HI>Dutch∣man,</HI>
who was so Enamour'd with her Fiz, that notwithstanding he had heard of her
Mis-fortune, he ty'd the Nooze, and became <HI>One Flesh,</HI> though of two very different
Constitutions. She was Young and Airy, and Married him more for the sake of
his Money than Person; he Old and Impotent, and as Jealous as a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> by which
her Condition was much worse than before; for on the least Distaste, he would be
Reflecting on her former Husband, who had not seen her since the Discovery, nor
she him, but heard of his Success, though not by what means he had attain'd it; and
was extream Sorry she had Contracted the last Marriage; but he having a desire to
see her, tho' not to take her again as a Wife, and thinking Time, Absence, and the
Alteration of his Attire, and Hair, (for when he Liv'd with her, he wore his own,
but now a Full Wigg) was Disguise sufficient to Conceal him from her Knowledge,
goes to the Shop, and she Congratulated him, with the usual Complement, of <HI>What
do you want, Sir?</HI> Two very necessary things, Madam, said he, Clean Gloves and
a Pritty Wife; and I Presume you may supply me. <HI>Of the First, Sir,</HI> answer'd his Wife,
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
<HI>We have Choice; but the last is a very scarce Commodity, and very difficult to be had.</HI> I
was in hopes, Madam, reply'd he, you could have furnish'd me with both; but more
especially the last. But she and her Partner both knew him, contrary to his Ex∣pectations:
<HI>Sir,</HI> said her Partner, <HI>I am perswaded you have no occasion for a</HI> Clogg; <HI>for
so a Wife is generally Term'd.</HI> But such a Pretty Lady as this is, would be counted
rather a Blessing, Madam, answer'd he. <HI>You wrong your Iudgement very much, Sir,</HI> re∣ply'd
his Wife, <HI>For Nature hath not been so Liberal to me in her Indowments, as you are
pleas'd to Flatter me with all. Besides I am a Wife already; and here the dull Animal: comes.</HI>
As he approach'd the Shop, the other spoke to him after this manner: I have been
Courting this Lady for a Wife, Sir, but I find you are so happy as to be before hand
with me. <HI>That's more than he knows, Sir,</HI> said she Smiling. By which he perceiv'd
they knew him; but her last Husband being Ignorant who he was, took it as a great
Affront, and in a mighty Passion abus'd her in a very high degree; and Upbraided
her with her first Husband; which so grated his Spirits, that it reviv'd the glowing
Embers of his Love, and the Conceal'd Sparks broke out into a violent Flame. Thou
Mercenary Villain, said he, to Upbraid thy Wife with what her Innocence was im∣pos'd
on; and as I am the Man that was the Aggressor, I'll do her that Justice to make
you ask her Pardon, here Publickly on your Knees: Or by <HI>Heaven,</HI> this Moment is
your last. At which he drew his Sword, and the Glittering Steel so scar'd poor
<HI>Hogan,</HI> that he presently fell on his Marrowbones, Crav'd her Pardon, and was Glad
he came off so. Now, Madam, said he, to his Wife, had not you been so dis-hon∣ourable
to me, on the Discovery of my Contract with you, I would have freed you
from the Embraces of this Insip'd Coxcomb; but since you was so Unkind, I can only
Condole your second Mis-fortune, who was so Ungrateful to me in your first; then
departed, and left poor <HI>Butter-Box,</HI> to be ridicul'd by the whole Society of <HI>Thim∣berkins.</HI>
A Friend of mine was an Eye Witness of this, and knew both the Husband
and Wife. <HI>Without doubt,</HI> said the Gentleman, <HI>This Spark was one of</HI> Solomons <HI>Race,
and</HI> Londons <HI>Master-Piece.</HI> Oh, Sir, 'tis Reported he is very much Reform'd to what
he was; and Lives very Sober and Sedate. <HI>Then it ought to be Chronicl'd for a Miracle,</HI>
said he.</P>
<P>But being come to the Rocky Decent into <HI>Marlborough,</HI> we were so Damnably jolted,
that our Merchants Pocket Comfort Vanish'd, and the Brittle Mettal was shatter'd
into a thousand pieces; for the loss of which, I intail'd such a Hearty Curse on the
Place, that never since hath a Coach past, but it Over-turn'd, a Waggon or Cart,
but it breaks either Wheel or Axeltree, a Horse, but he Stumbles; and all the Beasts
that Graze near it, Die of the <HI>Murraine:</HI> At last with the help of a couple of Gigan∣tick
Loobies, to support our Tottering Caravan, we got into the Town, and tipt
them a <HI>Hogg</HI> for our safe Conduct.</P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> we broke our fast at the <HI>Royal-Diadem,</HI> and had Mr.
<HI>Mayor</HI> for our Landlord, a good jolly <HI>Bachanalian,</HI> who hath bestow'd more in adorning
his Fiz, than the Market-house cost Building; and being a Magistrate, I made a heavy
Complaint against that Cursed Hill, demanded satisfaction for the Dammage we
had sustain'd, in breaking our Brandy Bottle, and told him, unless they took
speedy Care to have it mended, I would Indite the whole Corporation. <HI>That we
cannot do by no means, Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>For in so doing we should Ruine half the Town; for the
Dammage that Hill occasions, brings a Considerable Trade to our</HI> Wheel-wrights, Farriers,
<HI>and</HI> Chyrurgions; <HI>also Creates no small Business to those of my own Function, and Main∣tains
three or four Families to support the Coaches, and Assisting at other Accidents: But
however, I'll present you with a fresh Cargo, and Advise you to take more Care for the
future:</HI> Before we had Breakfasted, he was as good as his Word; but to retalliate
his Kindness, we call'd for two or three Flasks Extraordinary.</P>
<P>Having lay'd a good Foundation to Travel on, we quitted <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and soon
came on a curious Down, much Noted for its Flocks of <HI>Grey Weathers,</HI> which often gave
us Confounded Jolts, and put us in Mind of our Landlords Caution, concerning
our Bottle. But before we had Rod five Mile, we receiv'd Information of a Party
of <HI>Light-Horse</HI> that lay Perdue to Ease us of our <HI>Rin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> This News made us look
very queer, and my Company to sink the <HI>Cole</HI> with abundance of Agility. My
Mistress was in a Peck of Troubles, for the security of her Ponderous Purse; and
<PB N="12" REF="7"/>
I thought by the motion of her Pettycoats, she was a going to put it where my Lady
—did her Watch: Our Merchant shuffled Loose <HI>Yellow-Boys</HI> by dozens, into the
Linning of his Coat, and I Trusted to Providence: But at last to our great Satis∣faction
it prov'd to be a false Alarm, and by the help of our <HI>Nanterian</HI> Cordial, we
Recover'd our stragling Senses: The Discourse of which lasted us, till we got to <HI>Sandy-Lane,</HI>
where the Road was so Damnable heavy, that two mile in three hours was an
Extraordinary Journey, and the Corporation Trot to St. <HI>Pauls</HI> on <HI>Sunday,</HI> was a Fool
to it: But at last we Arriv'd at the Sign of <HI>Chevalier Bruine,</HI> where we was to Dine.</P>
<P>Here we had such an <HI>Amsterdam</HI> W—for our Landlady, that the like was never
heard of. She hath Buried five Husbands, never had but one Son, and he was Hang'd;
thirteen Daughters, and a Dozen of them was of their Mothers Stamp, and the other
Dy'd an Infant; the Old one was a Widdow, her Daughters Maid, yet between
them had more Children, then <HI>Rosemary-Lane</HI> affords on a <HI>Sunday;</HI> and most of their
<HI>Sires</HI> was <HI>Souldiers</HI> or <HI>Cattle-Firkers.</HI> There was more Coaches and Waggons, drawn
up before her Gate, then Hacks in <HI>Palace-Yard,</HI> during the <HI>Sessions of Parliament,</HI> or
<HI>Term-Time.</HI> All her Entertainment is Loins of <HI>Mutton,</HI> or <HI>Rabbets;</HI> and she makes
more Broth in a day, then all the <HI>Chop-Houses</HI> in <HI>Castle-Alley</HI> in a Week. At last,
with much ado, we got two of the aforesaid Dishes for Dinner, and a Nasty Jade
to Attend us; who, as we understood afterwards, was one of her Daughters; but
by her Looks, one would Conjecture the Devil was her Father; yet she was Re∣commended
to us, for the flower of them all: But in my Judgement the Old one
is more Inviting then any of her Off-spring. The best Accomodation we had there
was the Juice of Pippins, which we Drank very Plentifully, but by its Urinical motion,
hindred <HI>Whip</HI> one Mile in four; and the Ladies Emissary, Mistress <HI>Pert,</HI> once was so
hard put to it, that we thought by her Sower Looks, and the Ringing of her Knees,
she had the <HI>Dry-Gripes;</HI> but at last a Natural Evacuation gave her Ease, and Crea∣ted
us a great deal of Laughter. Our Bill was compos'd in a few Words; and was
very Moderate, considering what Extravagant Prices, we often give for <HI>Mutton</HI> and
<HI>Conny</HI> in some Places.</P>
<P>Having Din'd, we proceeded on our Journey, but with a great deal of difficulty;
for the Road was so Rocky, Unlevel, and Narrow in some places, that I am perswaded
the <HI>Alps</HI> are to be passed with less danger, in the Performance of which our firking
<HI>Essedarian</HI> was oblig'd to use abundance of Horse-Courting-Rhetorick to his Tired
<HI>Ambulators;</HI> and when that prevailed not, to Exercise his Tickler; but we were jolted
so Cursedly, that I thought it would have made a dislocation of my Bones; we all com∣plained,
but could find no Remedy; nor would I advise any who have been Suffer∣ers
in <HI>Venus</HI> sports, to Adventure the Fatigue of a Coach to the <HI>Bath,</HI> least it dis-joint
a Member or two. At last when our Patience was almost worn out, we agreed to
light rather than endure it any longer; but our Chariotier inform'd us, we were al∣most
at our Journeys-end, which we presently found to be true, and <HI>Bath</HI> was as
Welcome to us, as a good Dinner to a <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Tooth-picker.</P>
<P>Being come to the <HI>White-Hart,</HI> our long wish'd-for Port, we refreshed our selves
with much Joy, after our tedious Mortifying-Journey: And there our Merchant took
his Leave of us, in a fresh Coach for <HI>Bristol:</HI> Then Enquiring for a Lodging, we
were recommended to a <HI>Tonsers,</HI> whose Wife kept a <HI>Milliners-Shop</HI> in the same
House, where was Accommodation for us all, tho' he had several other Lodgers
in the House of good Quality. That Night my Widow and I had an oppor∣tunity
to enjoy our selves to our mutual Satisfaction, without any suspicion, and
agreed to be made one Flesh, the first opportunity that offer'd. In the Morning
we were saluted by the whole Fraternity of <HI>Cat-Gut-S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rapers,</HI> and cou'd not get rid
of them without the Assistance of an Angel. My Mistress and her Sister would
not appear publick, till their Baggage Arriv'd from <HI>London,</HI> which they did not ex∣pect
in three or four days, so I had the Liberty to stroul alone.</P>
<P>After I had Accounter'd my self to the best Advantage, (in which I made no small
Figure) I went to the Coffee-House, where I found several of my Acquaintance,
who seem'd to be Over-joy'd at my Appearance, Imbrac'd and Slabber'd me, as an
Old Woman does her Grand Child; asking a thousand Impertinent Questions con∣cerning
<HI>London,</HI> and what Company came with me? If Ladies, or Gentlemen? Whe∣ther
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
any Quality was on the Road bound for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> In which I satisfied them to
the best of my knowledge; but after we had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or two, of that insippid Li∣quor,
we Adjourn'd to Honest <HI>C</HI>— at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> where we Enliven'd our
Souls with a Glass of good <HI>Burdeaux,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and from thence we
went to see the Diversion of the <HI>Baths.</HI></P>
<P>Of which, 'tis not my Design to give you an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Original,</HI> and Emi∣nent
<HI>Cures;</HI> or a Description of their <HI>Structure</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; for that's alrea∣dy
perform'd, in most of our Chronicles; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on the <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>In∣trigues</HI>
that are manag'd there during the Season.</P>
<P>The first we went to, is call'd the <HI>Kings;</HI> and to it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, both run∣ning
in one; and the most famous for Cures. In this <HI>Bath</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> least fifty of both
Sexes, with a Score or two of Guides, who by their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Carcasses, and Lacker'd
Hides, you would think they had lain Pickling a Century of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Lake:</HI>
Some had those Infernal Emissaries to support their Impotent Limbs. Others to scrub
their Putrify'd Carcasses like a Race-Horse. In one Corner was an Old Fornicator
hanging by the Rings, Loaded with Rotten Humidity; Hard by him was a Buxom
Dame, Cleansing her <HI>Nunquam Satis</HI> from <HI>Mercurial</HI> Dregs, and the remains of <HI>Ro∣man
Vitriol.</HI> Another, half cover'd with Sear-Cloth, had more Sores than <HI>Lazarus</HI>
doing Pennance for the Sins of her Youth: At her Elbow was a Young Hero, sup∣ported
by a couple of Guides, rack'd with Aches and Intolerable Pains, Cursing of
<HI>Middlesex</HI> Court, and <HI>Beveridges</HI> Dancing-School, as Heartily as <HI>Iob</HI> the Day of his
Birth. At the Pump was several a Drenching their Gullets, and Gormandizing the
Reaking Liquor by wholesale.</P>
<P>From thence we went to the <HI>Cross-Bath,</HI> where most of the Quality resorts, more
Fam'd for <HI>Pleasure</HI> then <HI>Cures,</HI> tho' they pretend it hath wrought Miracles on <HI>Bar∣ren-Soil,</HI>
and wonderfully helps Conception. Not long since, a Gentleman of Qua∣lity
was beholden to it for an Heir, as he reported; but his Lady is of a Contrary
Opoinion; yet I know not what Operation such Tempting Objects may have by
causing Titilation, and heighten Imagination, to procure an Immediate Conjunction.
Here is perform'd all the Wanton Dalliancies imaginable; Celebrated Beauties,
Panting Breasts, and Curious Shapes, almost Expos'd to Publick View; Languishing
Eyes, Darting Killing Glances, Tempting Amorous Postures, attended by soft
Musick, enough to provoke a <HI>Vestal</HI> to forbidden Pleasure, Captivate a <HI>Saint,</HI> and Charm
a <HI>Iove:</HI> Here was also different Sexes, from Quality to the Honourable <HI>Knights,</HI> Coun∣try
<HI>Put,</HI> and City <HI>Madam's:</HI> Nay, the Circumciz'd <HI>Iew,</HI> could <HI>Bathe</HI> in Delight, <HI>Swim</HI>
in Pleasure with the <HI>Gentile,</HI> and out-vie a Courtier in Splendor, tho' they Crucifi'd his
God; and Dispence with <HI>Christians-Flesh,</HI> tho' not with <HI>Swines.</HI> The Ladies with their
floating <HI>Iappan</HI>-Bowles, freighted with Confectionary Kick-knacks, Essences, and Per∣fumes,
Wade about, like <HI>Neptun</HI>'s Courtiers, suppling their Industrious Joynts. The
Vigorous Sparks, presenting them with several Antick Postures, as Sailing on their
Backs, then Embracing the Element, sink in a Rapture, and by Accidental Design, thrust
a stretch'd Arm; but where the Water Conceal'd, so ought my Pen.</P>
<P>The Spectators in the Galleries, pleasing their Roving Fancies with this Ladies
Face, Anothers Eyes, a thirds heaving Breasts, and Profound Air. In one Corner
stood an old Letcher, whose years spoke him no less then threescore and ten, making
Love to a young Lady, not exceeding fourteen. The usual time being come to for∣sake
that fickle Element, <HI>Half-Tub-Chairs,</HI> Lin'd with Blankets, Ply'd as thick, as
<HI>Coaches</HI> at the <HI>Play-House,</HI> or <HI>Carts</HI> at the <HI>Custom-House.</HI></P>
<P>Bathing being over for that Day, we went to walk in the Grove, a very pleasant
Place for Diversion; there is the <HI>Royal-Oak</HI> and several Raffling Shops: In one of
the Walks, is several Sets of Nine-Pins, and Attendance to wait on you: Tipping
all Nine for a Guinea, is as common there, as two Farthings for a <HI>Porrenger</HI> of <HI>Bar∣ley-Broth,</HI>
at the <HI>Hospital-gate</HI> in <HI>Smithfield.</HI> On several of the Trees was hung a Lam∣poon
on the Marriage of one Mr. <HI>S</HI>—a Drugmonger, and the famous Madam <HI>S</HI>—an
old <HI>B</HI>—of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Having almost tir'd our selves with walking, we took to a Bench to ease our wea∣ry
Pedestals. Now, said my Friend, I'll give you an impartial Account of the Per∣fections,
Qualities and Functions, of a few particular Persons that are are among
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>
this Amphibious Crow'd. For Notwithstanding I have been here not above a Fort∣night,
I am as well acquainted with the Town and its Intrigues, as old Justice <HI>P</HI>—with
<HI>More-fields</HI> and <HI>Drury Lane</HI> Bawdy houses.</P>
<P>Those two Ladies with the Gentleman in Blew, are Sisters, live near the Church
that is Dedicated to a Saint who expir'd on a Gridiron, they are Amorous Dames;
the Gentleman is a Broken Officer, and lives better on their Allowances, than he
could on his Pay. This Gentlewoman in the White-Damask Gown, is a Sea-Cap∣tains
Lady; who, while her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orniferous Mate is Plowing the Ocean, takes Care to
manure his <HI>Pasture,</HI> that he may have a Fruitful Crop this Harvest. That Foppish
<HI>Beau</HI> in Scarlet Stockins, whose Hilt of his Sword bears a bob with his Calves, and
his Jubilee Hatband, lies stitch'd cross the Crown, was a Pettycoat-Pensioner to Ma∣dam
<HI>C</HI>—near <HI>Bucklersbury</HI>; but being lately Discarded, is come down here for pro∣motion.
That young Lady with the Gold Orice Pettycoat, was a great Fortune,
and not long since was married to a Flannel Wastecoat, and a double Night-cap of
the same Stuff; But now by reason of her Husbands Imbecility, is forc'd to have re∣course
to the <HI>Bath.</HI> That tall Gentleman attended by three Liveries, is something
of Quality, a right Courtier, for he abhors the Citizens Wives as much as the Sword
Bearer does <HI>Custard.</HI> That <HI>Broad-piece</HI> Doctor, in the diminutive Band, makes a pur∣chase
every year by the Wickedness of the Age; and Vindicates <HI>W—ing</HI> more
than ever <HI>G. K</HI>—Writ against the Quakers. That Pert young Gentlewoman with
the two Silver Fringes, was compell'd by her Friends to Marry a Slovenly <HI>Stockjobber,</HI>
and now is surfeited with his Embraces; and came to the <HI>Bath</HI> to mend his Breed.
That Crafty Priest, that Son of <HI>Levi,</HI> is as fickle as a Weather-Cock, and would sooner
discard a good Conscience, then a fat Benefice. This Tun of Iniquity, in the Crim∣son
Gown with <HI>Monsieur</HI> at her Elbow, two <HI>Devils</HI> behind her, <HI>Aetna</HI> in her Face,
all the Water in the <HI>Severn</HI> is not able to Quench her desires; she is a second <HI>Masse∣lina,</HI>
will tire, but ne'er be satisfied; she hath already quarter'd a Troop of <HI>French</HI>
Dragoons, a Regiment of <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> and now is come to Exercise a Battalion of
<HI>Brittains.</HI> That Powder'd <HI>Lobster</HI> in the Edg'd Hat, is the Spawn of a <HI>Broker;</HI> from
thence Evapulated to a <HI>Bully,</HI> now shams an <HI>Officer,</HI> sets up for a <HI>Stallion</HI> of the first
Rank, and pretends he receives several Favours from a Qualitificated Lady. That
Spark with his Hat under his Arm, is a Limb of the Law, but hath Studied <HI>Cham∣berlins</HI>
Midwitry, more than <HI>Cook's</HI> Reports. That <HI>Dowdy Minx</HI> in the Scarlet Top∣ping,
and Pinck'd Scarff, is the Relick of a broken <HI>Grocer;</HI> an Industrious Woman,
for her Head's no sooner lay'd, but her Breech is at Work. In short, for <HI>Fops, Beaus,</HI>
and <HI>Bellfa's,</HI> this Place exceeds <HI>Greys-Inn-Walks</HI> on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening; and consists
of greater variety of Persons, Remarkable for some Vice or Folly, than there are In∣gredients
in a Lombard-Pye for a City Feast; to give you a particular Description
of each of 'em, will require a Weeks time at least. Come therefore let's go to some
Tipling Mansion, and Carrouse, till we have Exhilerated our Drouthy Souls: To
which I readily agreed. About five in the Evening, we went to see a great <HI>Match</HI>
at Bowling; there was <HI>Quallity,</HI> and Reverend <HI>Doctors</HI> of both professions, Topping
<HI>Merchants,</HI> Broken <HI>Bankers,</HI> Noted <HI>Mercers,</HI> Inns-of-Court <HI>Rakes,</HI> City <HI>Beaus,</HI> Stray'd
<HI>Prentices,</HI> and <HI>Dancing-Masters</HI> in abundance. <HI>Fly, fly, fly, fly;</HI> said one: <HI>Rub, rub,
rub, rub,</HI> cry'd another. <HI>Ten Guinies to five, I Vncover the</HI> Jack, says a third. <HI>Damn
these Nice Fingers of mine,</HI> cry'd my Lord, <HI>I Slipt my Bowl, and mistook the Bias.</HI> Ano∣ther
Swearing he knew the Ground to an Inch, and would hold five Pound his Bowl
came in. But in short, the Citizens won the Courtiers Money, and the Courtiers
Swore to be Reveng'd on their Wives, and Daughters.</P>
<P>From hence we went to the <HI>Groom-Porters,</HI> where they were a Labouring like so
many <HI>Anchor-Smiths,</HI> at the <HI>Oake, Back Gammon, Tick-Tack, Irish, Basset,</HI> and throwing
of <HI>Mains.</HI> There was Palming, Lodging, Loaded Dice, Levant, and Gammonning,
with all the Speed imaginable; but the <HI>Cornish</HI> Rook was too hard for them all.
The <HI>Bristol Fair</HI> Sparks had but a very bad bargain of it; and little occasion for Re∣turns.
<HI>Bank-Bills,</HI> and <HI>Exchequer-Notes,</HI> were as Plenty, as <HI>Fops</HI> at the <HI>Chocolat-Houses,</HI>
or <HI>Patternoster-Row.</HI> Having satisfied our Curiosity here; we left them as busie a sha∣king
their Elbows, as the <HI>Apple-women</HI> in <HI>Stocks-Market,</HI> Wallnuts in <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>And meeting with three or four more Acquaintance, we stroul'd to a <HI>Bristol-Milk
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>
Dary-House,</HI> and Enjoy'd our selves like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> At Night I stole into
my Mistresses Arms, as Vigorous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Love, could inspire
me; but she Urging mightily for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was not very back∣ward
to, we agreed to be Rivented <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to ingage the
Maid to Assist her, and I, our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which accordingly
was perform'd the next day, with a great deal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Expence of half a
score Guineas; and Spouse deny'd it might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> continu'd in the
Country, for some particular Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the Priest, Ma∣dam
<HI>Bride,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Pert,</HI> managed it so, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> any Mistrust.
<HI>Let a Woman alone for a Contrivance, to</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P>About ten in the Morning, I was sent for by some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the general
Rendezvouz—<HI>Coffee-house,</HI> where Fools, Cullies, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, resort
as thick, as <HI>Stock-Iobbers</HI> about the Effigies on the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Witicism
was Abdicated, and Nonsence banded to and fro, like a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. The last
Nights Intrigue Whisper'd with abundance of Caution, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was
Prognosticated would be very Noble, for 'twas given by a Lady <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and af∣ter
an hour or two of their insippid Fustian and Block-headly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> went to
Raffle for a Present for our Mistresses; and with the loss of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> off
a curious Snush-Box, worth four: But tho' I was Fortunes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a
young Mercer of twenty <HI>Iacobusses,</HI> and at the <HI>Oake</HI> the same Night double the
Number, and a Bay Gelding.</P>
<P>From thence we went to the <HI>Hot-Bath,</HI> and <HI>Leppers-Bath,</HI> but there was nothing worth
our Observation, but a parcel of old Crutches, hung up in Memory of the Persons,
that receiv'd those Miraculous Cures. The next place we adjourn'd to, was to
<HI>Horrid-Toms;</HI> where we had good Wine, and better Company; and being my Wed∣ding-Day,
I went home to Dine with my Bride, and in the Evening prevail'd with
her to go to the Ball.</P>
<P>Which is always kept at the Town-Hall, a very spacious Room, and fitted up for
that Purpose. During which, the Door is kept by a couple of Brawny Beadles, to
keep out the Mobility, looking as fierce as the Uncouth Figures at <HI>Guild-Hall;</HI> there
was Extraordinary Fine Dancing, (and how could it otherwise chuse) for Spouse and
I had a Hand in it. A Consort of Delicate Musick, Vocal and Instrumental, per∣form'd
by good Masters: A Noble Collation of dry Sweat-Meats, Rich Wine, and
Large Attendance. The Lady who was the <HI>Donor,</HI> wore an Extraordinary Rich
Favour, to distinguish her from the rest, which is always the Custome; and before
they break up, to chuse another for the next Day, which fell upon a Shentleman
of <HI>Wales;</HI> but hur no ways Derogated from hur Honour, or Disparag'd hur Coun∣trey
in the least, but hur was as Noble, and as Generous, as e'er an <HI>English</HI> Shentle∣man
of them all: To hur Honour be it Spoke.</P>
<P>The next Day the Ladies Baggage Arriv'd from <HI>London;</HI> then they made as topping
a Figure as any of them all; and the first Night after their Publick appearance,
we were so troubled with some serenading Coxcombs, that the whole Family got up,
and had not Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> been very vigilant, my new Adopted Flesh and I, had been
catch'd abed together; for which good Service, I rewarded her with a broad piece
of her own Name. A <HI>Sunday</HI> we went to Church to the Abby, a very Ancient Ca∣thedral
piece of Antiquity, and kept as badly in repair; 'tis Crowded during Divine
Service, as much as St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> in which time there is more Billet Deaux convey'd to
the Ladies, than Notes to desire the Prayers of the Congregation at <HI>B</HI>'s—Meeting∣House:
and as the Ingenious Doctor in his Discourse, told the Audience, <HI>He was
afraid most of them came more out of Custome and Formality, than in Devotion to the Sa∣cred
Deity, or a sutable Reverence to the Place of Worship.</HI> Which was very True I am
Confident, and the Ladies were the only Saints several came there to Adore; as this
Billet Deaux will confirm; it was convey'd in a Candid Orange to a Lady in one of the
Galleries, which she by Accident dropt, and I had the Fortune to find.</P>

much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for an obliging Temper, the other for a Beauty;

<P>After an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Walking, I Treated my Ladies with the best the Place
afforded, and then returned Home. But the next Morning I receiv'd a Letter of
Advice from <HI>London,</HI> of the Death of an Aunt, who had made me her Heir;
which put me in mind of the Old Proverb, <HI>It never Rains, but must Pour.</HI> However
this was no ill News to my Bride, nor me neither; only requiring my speedy
appearance at <HI>London;</HI> but I promised Spouse and the rest of my Acquaintance to be
with them again in a Fortnights time, and tho' an Heir, took Leave of them with as
much Regreet, as the <HI>Dutch-Guards</HI> of <HI>Kensington;</HI> and the next Morning took Post
for <HI>London.</HI> Having now given you an Account of my successful Step, I'll make
bold, and give you my Sentiments of the <HI>BATH.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A Character of the Bath.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS, neither Town nor City, yet goes by the Name of both; five Months in the
Year 'tis as Populous as <HI>London,</HI> the other seven as desolate as a Wilderness.
It's chiefest Inhabitants are Turn-spit-Dogs; and it looks like <HI>Lombard-street</HI> on a
Saints-day. During the Season, it hath as many Families in a House as <HI>Edenborough;</HI>
and Bills are as thick for Lodgings to be Let, as there was for Houses in the <HI>Fry∣ars</HI>
on the Late Act of Parliament for the Dissolution of Priviledges; but when the
<HI>Baths</HI> are useless, so are their Houses, and as empty as the new Buildings by St.
<HI>Giles</HI> in the Fields: The <HI>Baths</HI> I can compare to nothing but the <HI>Boylers</HI> in <HI>Fleet∣lane</HI>
or <HI>Old-Bedlam,</HI> for they have a reaking steem all the year. In a word, 'tis
a Valley of Pleasure, yet a sink of Iniquity; Nor is there any Intrigues or Debauch
Acted at <HI>London,</HI> but is Mimick'd there.</P>
