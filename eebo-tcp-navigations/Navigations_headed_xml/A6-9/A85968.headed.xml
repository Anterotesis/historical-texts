<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TIs done without <HI>Amen,</HI> or superstition,</L>
<L><HI>Popes</HI> Bull, or the Committees inquisition:</L>
<L>What think ye now of Plays? Abominable:</L>
<L>Or is't 'cause you want wit to unfold a Fable,</L>
<L>Pick out the Allegory, drive the sense</L>
<L>Where the Plot aims it: that your benevolence</L>
<L>Should clap us, and our mouths up. Confess, confess;</L>
<L>You would be something, and 'gainst Plays you press,</L>
<L>To be prickt down as States-men, not because</L>
<L>You do conceive um hurtfull, but will make Laws,</L>
<L>To undo the Gallants pastime of the Land:</L>
<L>Beats down because you cannot understand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Slow Readers, look upon the <HI>Roman</HI> State,</L>
<L>Whose high built frame the stars durst emulate,</L>
<L>And look as far as they. Ask <HI>Livie</HI> there,</L>
<L>How many worthies grac'd her Theatre:</L>
<L>They whose civility hath nurst us all;</L>
<L>Thought um most holy, stil'd um Tragical,</L>
<L>From their Gods Sacrifices. And must we,</L>
<L>Whose pollish'd Scene purg'd from obscenity</L>
<L>By Poets flaming fancies, whose bright rays</L>
<L>Consume scurrility, and fix the Bays</L>
<PB N="46" REF="26"/>
<L> With us to fan profaness, drive away</L>
<L>Light chaff, that in pure colours, Scenes display.</L>
<L>When plots work high with contradictions fill'd,</L>
<L>Amazing you, how are they reconcil'd?</L>
<L>Must we I say be censur'd? Why 'tis your nature</L>
<L>To gaze at new things, adore the fashions altar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, more resist your own opinions. We</L>
<L>Will dress our Scenes with various novelty,</L>
<L>And teach you wit enough for eighteen pence</L>
<L>Above the reach of the Common Councils sense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Try and persever, if you finde this true,</L>
<L>Silence your errours, and we are quit with you.</L>
