<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Parliament of Scotland begins to display the banner of great Politicians, and have taken an Oath of Secresie not to impart or disclose the results of their debates til all things come to maturity and ripenesse: all their consul∣tations tends to the purging of the Army, adhering to their Covenant, and maintaining their Government by a mixt Mo∣narchy of King, Lords, and Commons; and in order there∣unto,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>the major part have entred into protest, and declared, in the name of all the Commons of that Kingdom, That they will (to the utmost of their power) endeavour the preser∣vation of the peace and tranquility thereof, against all op∣position or power whatsoever, and that they will likewise endeavour the true establishing of a firm and unspotted Mo∣narchy <HI>(which can hardly be)</HI> according to the ancient Lawes Liberties and Custome of that Kingdom, and doth further remonstrate exceeding high language against the Parlia∣ment of <HI>England,</HI> in reference to the late Kings execution, &amp; their present transactions between Parliament and Army: But their young Kings Answer seeming unsatisfactory to the desires of the Commissioners of the Kirk, causeth them rather to pray for his Conversion; then advise his Confor∣mity.</P>
<P>However, the vulgar sort of people seem to rescent his condescensions, and say, that unlesse their plants receive moi∣sture from the sap of the Cedar, the bark and pith of the poor Shrub will fade and decay.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that tyrannicall Oppressors have received an allarum throughout all Ages, with the desperate Careers of a distressed multitude, who no sooner enter by storme, but they make their enemies (though never so great) drink the dregs of their cup of fury, and not only so, but leaves them and their Issue, odious to all posterity.</P>
<P>But its hoped that those who keep their Trophies of <HI>Vic∣toria</HI> by love, will challenge a high applause of Christiani∣ty and Souldiery, and attempt desperate adventures for the bringing of their oppressors to a speedy ruine; notwithstan∣ding all their forraign machavilianism, to a new involving; It being apparent that their present actings beyond the Seas, tends to the universall destruction of the well-affected par∣ty throughout the three Nations; the which, that it may ap∣pear
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>more visible to your stately Fabrick and renowned Metropolis, I shall here represent unto the Ornaments and Inhabitants thereof, a perfect Demonstration and Declara∣tion of the proceedings of the King of Scots and his Adhe∣rents, in reference to an engagement against them; to the end they may receive a timely allarum, for a ananimous associ∣ation, with those renowned Trustees, who have so deerly purchased their liberties; the sum and abstract whereof I shall here insert as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The King of Scots hath sent severall Embassies to forraign Princes and Potentates; <HI>to wit,</HI> the most high and mighty Imperialist, the Emperour of Germany, <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Spain, Lewis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and the most pious and vertuous Princesse the Queen of <HI>Swethland,</HI> earnestly imploring time∣ly ayd and assistance for his restauration; and we hear that great preparations are (there) making suitable to his De∣sires, and that upon the Confines of High Germany severall Regiments of Horse and Foot are raising, which are to be distinctly divided into four Brigades, each Brigade to con∣sist of 4000 Horse, and 6000 Foot, to be commanded by Generall <HI>Hatzfield,</HI> who hath Commission proffered from the King of Scots, for the leading and conducting of them according as his titular Majesty and his Councell shall de∣termine of. (<HI>This Generall</HI> Hatzfield <HI>hath a point of great po∣licy if he can raise somthing out of nothing; for although there be so many designed, yet there are not a quarter so many (as yet) levied.</HI></P>
<P>We hear that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> hath sent an additio∣nall Fleet to the Zund, to intercept and fall upon the English ships at their return from the East Country; and for cer∣tain it is, that both the Scots and others have them in a uni∣versall hatred.</P>

<P>THe Marq. of Ormond with <HI>13000</HI> Horse and Foot is sate down before the City of Dublin, with a resolution to storm, if not suddenly surrendred upon summons; but renowned Col. Jones hath taken a resolution to fight it out to the last man, and hath already made a gallant attempt and inroad vpon his Outquartes with <HI>2000</HI> Horse and Foot; and after a sharp conflict Col. <HI>Jones</HI> made an honourable retreat in∣to the City with the losse of <HI>7</HI> or <HI>8,</HI> besides some sew wounded; but the Lord <HI>Inchiquins</HI> Brigade of horse being gallantly moun∣ted, took vpon them great resolution, and embraced the pursuit within a quarter of a mile of the Gates, where we had a second engagement, which continued very dubious for the space of half an hour, till at last a considerable party of the Sea-men came in to our assistance, who by their lining of the hedges, did so gall the Enemy, that they were forced to retreat, leaving above <HI>30</HI> men dead vpon the place; in which fight we took Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> Cornet <HI>Johnson,</HI> and about ten more prisoners, with the losse of five men.</P>
<P>Since which time, they have made another attempt vpon our Out-guards, and vpon the neer approoch of their forlorn hope consisting of about <HI>60</HI> horse, <HI>30</HI> of ours answered their charge, and shot Lieut. Col. <HI>Dungans</HI> horse vnder him, took him priso∣ner, and Major <HI>Dungan</HI> his brother was mortally wounded, our men brought off <HI>7</HI> of their horse, and (blessed be God) but one man wounded, none slain.</P>
<P>They are incamped within a mile and a half of the City, where they expect the coming vp of the Earl of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> Lord <HI>Taff,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Dillon,</HI> with their forces, for a sudden con∣junction; and then to make a sharp storm.</P>
<P>Their Tents are pitcht on this side <HI>Fingles,</HI> their horse and foot lye all in our sight; Col. <HI>Jones</HI> is labouring hard to fortifie against them, hath given Orders for the pulling down all the Outhouses that may advantage their design, and hath set forth Proclamation for all the Irish Papists, and other disaffected
<PB REF="4"/>Citizens, to depart the City within <HI>12</HI> hours after the publish∣ing thereof; by whose unwearied pains and vigilancy, we are in some reasonable possibility of the more safety thereby, &amp; have hard duty to attend the Line dayly, but great will, vigour and eadinesse is in all men to perform the service: We have about <HI>7000</HI> foot (with the Inhabitants) fighting men, and about <HI>500</HI> horse to face the enemy: Our provisions consume very fast, and every thing is excessive dear, having now neither fish nor flesh to come to our Markets, the enemy being possessed of that which should relieve us; and are in a prosperous condition at present, and like to do what they please if our friends in England do not relieve us suddenly, and mo∣cey to pay them and those that are already here, and more provisions for them all, for Wheat is here at <HI>5. li. 10. s.</HI> the quarter, Rye at <HI>4. li. 10. s.</HI> the quarter, little to sell, and little money to buy it, our Men of War are come from Bewmorris, and divers ships from Chester, and no men nor money, it is impossible (in mans judgment) for us to hold out till ayd comes from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We have lost the good Town of <HI>Kildare,</HI> but it cost the enemy ve∣ry deer; for after three or four desperate assaults made by them on the breaches, made by their Canon, having lost many of their men they sent for a parley, and observing the undauted resolution of Lies Col. <HI>Huteson</HI> and Cap. <HI>Dixon,</HI> who commanded the men there, &amp; mo- of the men vnder them, although many of their men would not fighst at all, &amp; are since gone to the enemy, that they gave our men quartet in two dayes to carry away what they had, where was great store of corr and meal, Ballesoman is besieged, and it must be lost because we can∣not come to relieve them.</P>
<P>We hear that <HI>Owen Oneal</HI> with his forces is joyned with them of <HI>Kilkenny</HI> against us, but we have no certainty thereof. We are in a very sad condition, all our provisions being almost all spent, yet I hope the Lord will defend this place, and that every one that puts his trust in him shall be delivered, to whose blessed protection I commend you, and rest ever,</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Propositions of Generall</HI> Owen Oneal, <HI>the Lords, Gentry, and Commons of the Confederate Catholiques in</HI> Ulster.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the most honorable and potent the Parliament of England.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IMprimis,</HI> That all Laws, Statutes, Penalties, made, past, or con∣cluded against the Roman Catholiques, its Ministers or pro∣fessors, their liberties and exercises of the said Religion, since the 21 year of <HI>H.</HI> 8 to be reclaimed and perpetually to be taken off, and to extend to that party and their successors for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2 That the said Gen. <HI>Oneal</HI> desires that an Act of Oblivion be passed to extend to all and every of his party, for all things done since the beginning of the year 1641. 3 They desire that General <HI>Oneal</HI> be provided for a competent command in the army, befit∣ting his place worth or quality. 4 That on both sides, all jealou∣sies, hate and aversion be laid aside, unity, love and amity be re∣newed and proclaimed between both parties. 5 That the Army belonging to Generall <HI>Oneal</HI> and his party, be provided for in all points as the rest of the Army shall be.</P>
<P>Letters further from Berwick say, That the Scots begin to unite and that the major part are for an agreement with their King; but (say some) their chief object (at present) is upon Dublin, and that if Generall <HI>Ormond</HI> becomes master thereof, they intend a con∣junction, and so to march into England with a very considerable Body, and the young King in the head of them. But these vapours are supposed to arise only from a Scottish Mist, which with one strong Southernly English Gale, become quite expelled and dis∣solved.</P>
