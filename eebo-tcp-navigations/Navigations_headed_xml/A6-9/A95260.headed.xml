<P>THe Forces of the Parliament by Sea have done their utmost endeavours to maintain the cause, which by so solemne a Covenant they have professed: What my Lord Admirall performed at sea in the reliefe of LYME is already expressed, and what untill this time he hath done since the great ship called the JAMES lay at anchor before TORBAY, is sufficiently de∣clared by former Pens. We shall at this time but onely point unto you what mistakes by misintelli∣gence have growne upon our dis∣courses
<PB REF="3"/>and belief, and that whiles for many dayes we have believed that the Queene was removed to Excester, vvee must novv assure you, that she vvas all that vvhile in Cornevvall, untill on Sunday, being July 14. she tooke from Fal∣mouth her shipping into France.</P>
<P>But the designe of her expediti∣on could not bee carried vvith so much secrecy, but it vvas discove∣red to the Lord Admirall, vvho on the first information of it, knovving of vvhat consequence vvas her departure into France, did command all the ships then in the Westerne parts to overtake her: they could not (at the first command) come so easily in as vvas desired, but having knovvledge of vvhat importance vvas the busi∣nesse,
<PB REF="3"/>vvith Wind and sayle they made haste to overtake her.</P>
<P>And indeed had the vvind bin more propitious to them, they had gone neer to have possessed them∣selves of this mighty prize, I vvill acquaint you vvord for vvord vvith vvhat, in a Letter sent from a speciall Friend, I send you here Related.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday was sevennight, all the Ships my Lord had with him were sent to plye about <HI>Falmouth,</HI> the place where she imbarqued, and till Sunday last had no tydings of the Enemies comming forth; when in the morning some of the Ships in har∣bour were seene to set sayle, our Vice-Admirall betooke himselfe to a readinesse. The first of the Enemies was a Flemmish man of Warre, who comming within shot the Vice-Admirall gave him twelve Guns in his quarters, but he without any replye, got to wind∣ward, and then made out all his
<PB REF="4"/>sayle, the rest of the Ships being ten in number, followed him, and getting the advantage of the wind, avoided all annoyance from our Ships; three whereof lay so farre off to Sea, as they could not come in to doe service, till the Vice-Ad∣mirall gave chase: at last a nimble Frigot of ours got into play, and m de the Enemy use their Ord∣nance for their owne safety, this interlude of shot continued as long as our Ships could tacke with the Enemies, but they comming out tallowed and traind for so impor∣tant a service, had a maine advan∣tage in flight: however they were chased to the very borders of <HI>France,</HI> where they tooke in at <HI>Brest,</HI> and there landed her Maje∣stie. Her Majesty fearing such a
<PB REF="5"/>storme, had provided for her secu∣rer escape (in case those other ves∣sels should have beene worsted) a Galley of 16 Oares, which the best vessell in the world could never have coapt with, so as now we must only salve all with patience, yet if my Lord had bin furnished with other ships, we should not have doubted but to have given a good account of this businesse. No other newes I can for the present acquaint you vvith.</P>
<P>My Lord Admirall hath also taken a Ship of the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> of great value, cal'd the Golden <HI>Sun,</HI> carried it into <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> where it is to remaine till the Parliaments pleasure be further knowne.</P>
