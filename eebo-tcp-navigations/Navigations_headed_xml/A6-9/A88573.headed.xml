<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Business of setling the Tariff between <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France</HI> has been so long in agitation, so generally talked of, and yet so little understood as to the essential Grounds thereof, that it has been thought a Work not un∣acceptable to the Publick, to give a clear View of it; and since the same can appear no where so well as in the distinct Treaty of Commerce and Na∣vigation, that has been some time since concluded between the said Nations, which has never yet been exposed in <HI>English,</HI> we have thought fit to publish the same in the full Extent of it, with the separate Article relating to the Imposition of fifty Pence <HI>per</HI> Tun upon Strangers, (about which the main of the Contest has been) whereby it will appear how Just and Equitable the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pretentions are, and that it's a meer Sham for their Opponents to say, <HI>They understood not what they did, when they a∣greed to it;</HI> as it may be of some good use to our selves when we come to treat about Trade with that Nation, who, by what has followed in consequence to the ensuing Treaty, can never be bound too fast.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Treaty of Commerce,</HI> Concluded and Agreed upon at <HI>RESWICK</HI> in <HI>HOLLAND,</HI> ON The 20th of <HI>September,</HI> 1697. BETWEEN His Most Christian Majesty's Embassa∣dors and Plenipotentiaries, on the one part; AND The Embassadors and Plenipotentiaries of the Lords States General of the United Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> on the other.</HEAD>
<P>THE Treaty of Peace that has been concluded this Day between the most Christian King and the Lords States General of the United Provinces, having put a final Period to all the Causes of Discontent, which, for some time past, had alienated the Af∣fection which his most Christian Majesty has always had for their Good and Prosperity, according to the Example of the Kings his Pre∣decessors; and the said Lords the States General returning also to the same Desires, which they have heretofore testified for the Grandeur of <HI>France,</HI> and into the Sentiments of a sincere Acknowledgment of all the Obligations and considerable Advantages which they have formerly received: His Ma∣jesty
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>being unwilling to obstruct any thing that may confirm it; and the said States General being no less desirous to perpetuate the same, have thought there could be no better and more assured Means pitch'd upon to effect it, than by establishing a free and perfect Correspondence between their Subjects both on the one side and t'other, and for that purpose to re∣gulate their particular Interests, in point of Commerce, Navigation and Maritime Affairs, by the most proper Laws and Agreements that can be, for the prevention of all the Inconveniencies that may lessen a good Cor∣respondence between them: His said Majesty, in compliance with the Desires of the said States General, appointed the Sieur <HI>Nicholas Augustus de Harlay,</HI> Knight, Lord of <HI>Bonneuil,</HI> Count of <HI>Celi,</HI> Councellor in Ordinary to his Majesty in his Council of State; the Sieur <HI>Lovis Verjus,</HI> Knight, Count of <HI>Crecy,</HI> the King's Councellor in Ordinary in his Council of State, Marquess of <HI>Treon,</HI> Baron of <HI>Couvay,</HI> Lord of <HI>Boulay,</HI> of the two Churches of <HI>Fortisle,</HI> of <HI>Me∣villet, &amp;c.</HI> and the Sieur <HI>Francis de Callieres,</HI> Lord of <HI>Callieres, la Roche, Chellay</HI> and <HI>Gigny;</HI> to be his Majesty's Embassadors Extraordinary and Plenipo∣tentiaries in the Assembly for the Negotiation of the Peace: And the said Lords the States General, the Sieurs <HI>Antony Heinsius,</HI> Councellor and Pen∣sionary of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>West-Friesland,</HI> Keeper of the Great Seal, and Superintendant of the Fiefs; <HI>Everhard de Weede,</HI> Lord of <HI>Weede, Dijckvelt, Rateles, &amp;c.</HI> Lord Proprietor of the Town of <HI>Oudewater,</HI> Dean and Rector of the Imperial Chapter of St. <HI>Mary</HI> at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> Dijck-Grave of the River <HI>Rhine</HI> in the Province of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> President of the States of the said Province; and <HI>William de Haren,</HI> Grietman of <HI>Bilt,</HI> the Nobilities De∣puty of the States of <HI>Friesland,</HI> and Curator of the University of <HI>Frane∣ker,</HI> Deputies in their Assembly on the part of the States of <HI>Holland, Ʋtrecht</HI> and <HI>Friesland,</HI> to Confer and Agree upon a Treaty of Commerce and Na∣vigation in the following manner, by Vertue of their Powers respective∣ly produced by them, the Copies whereof you have hereafter inserted.</P>

<P>THE Subjects of his Majesty and of the Lords the States General of the United Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> shall reciprocally enjoy the same Liberty, in point of Commerce and Navigation, which they have al∣ready had before this War, in all the Kingdoms, States and Provinces of the one and the other Party.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>And thus they shall not for the future exercise any sorts of Hostilities or Violences against each other, either by Sea or Land, or in Rivers, Roads and fresh Waters, under any Name or Pretence whatsoever; and more∣over the Subjects of his said Majesty, cannot take any Commissions for particular Ships, or Letters of Reprizal, from any Princes or States, who are Enemies to the said Lords the States General, and neither trouble nor damnifie them any manner of way, by Vertue of such Commissions or Letters of Reprizal, nor even to rove with them upon the Sea, under the Penalty of being prosecuted and punished as Pirates; which shall be
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>reciprocally observed by the Subjects of the United Provinces, in respect to his Majesty's Subjects; and to this end there shall be most express and apposite Prohibitions published and renewed, as often as there shall be oc∣casion on either part, that they shall by no means make use of such Com∣missions or Letters of Reprizals, under the fore-mentioned Penalties, which shall be severely executed upon all Offenders in that kind, besides, an en∣tire Restitution to be made to those who have received the Damage.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>And in order to obviate, as much as is possible, all those Inconveni∣ences, that may arise by the taking of Prizes through Inadvertency, or otherwise, and more especially in remote Parts; it hath been agreed, That if any such Prizes, on either side, shall be made in the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, or that of the North, from <HI>Torneuse,</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> to the end of the Chan∣nel, in the space of four Weeks, or from the end of the said Channel, to the Cape of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> in the space of six Weeks, and from thence in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, and as far as the Line, in the space of ten Weeks, and on the other side of the Line, and all other parts of the World, in the space of eight Months, the same to be computed from the publicati∣on of these Presents; the said Prizes and Damages, which shall be made on either side, after the Terms prefixed, shall be accounted for, and whatever shall be so taken, shall be restored, with a Compensation made for all Damages that may arise thereby.</P>

<DIV3 N="23" TYPE="section">

<P>The same thing is to be done in respect to the <HI>French</HI> Ships and Barks, that put into some Roads belonging to the Territories under the Obedi∣ence of the said Lords the States, without entring into the Ports, or if they go in, yet have no mind to unlade and break their Cargoes, of which they are not obliged to give an Account, unless it be that there is a suspi∣tion, lest they should carry Contraband-goods to the Enemies of the said Lords the States, as has been said before.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="7"/>that so it may be known by these two ways, whether they carry contra∣band Goods, and that as well the Quality of the Ship, as of the Master, may sufficiently appear thereby, to which Past-ports and Letters of Mart an entire Belief and Credit ought to be given; and to the end the Validi∣ty thereof may be the better known, and that they can be by no means falsified and counterfeited, his said Majesty and the said Lords the States General shall prescribe certain Marks and Counter-signings thereunto.</P>
