<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>William,</HI> Earl of <HI>Craven; John,</HI> Earl of <HI>Bath; John,</HI> Lord <HI>Berkley; George,</HI> Lord <HI>Cartret; Anthony,</HI> Lord <HI>Ashley;</HI> Sir <HI>John Colleton,</HI> Barronet: Being Proprietors of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"> Thomas Bulkley, <HI>a Free-holder, Inhabitant and Merchant of</HI> New Providence <HI>(one of the said Islands) Humbly presenteth the following Address,</HI> Viz.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas (by sundry papers Presented to Your Lordships for Your perusal;) <HI>I</HI> the said <HI>Bulkley,</HI> have informed You larg∣ly and particularly of the Numerous and Highly aggravated Crimes and Misde∣meanours of <HI>Cadwallader Jones,</HI> late Governour of Your last named Province, in and through the whole time that he pre∣sided there; and of my long continued Cruel Sufferings (un∣der his Usurped Tyrannical power) for my Loyalty to the King, Fidelity and Zealous Service to Your Lordships, and the Inhabitants of Your said Province: And that after I was
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> delivered by Law, I demanded Legal Process against <HI>Jones,</HI> his wicked Abettors, and Agents; but it was Corruptly de∣nied to me by <HI>Nicholas Trott,</HI> (whom Your Lordships Com∣missioned to succeed <HI>Jones</HI> in the Government of the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands, and by Governour <HI>Blake,</HI> and the rest of Your Ju∣dicial Officers at <HI>Carolina,</HI> and presented Proposals to Your Lordships, <HI>Viz.</HI> That You would put me into a Capacity by Law to Obtain speedy Justice in the Reparation of my Damages, and the Condign Punishment of my barbarous Oppressors, and those who by a perjurious neglect of doing Justice, have promoted their Escape, all which Papers I hope Your Lordships have throughly perused, and duly conside∣red, and my just Expectations and Supplications as afore∣said, the Reasonableness whereof, I humbly offer to Your Lordships further consideration, in the particulars following.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>Because the Office and Exorbitant Power whereby <HI>Jones</HI> was inabled and imboldened to commit those horrible Crimes Alledged against him, and to Oppress me so cruelly for my opposing him therein regularly and according to the duty of my Place and Station in the Government, was Conferred on him by Commission and instructions from Your Lordships without due Examination of his fitness for discharging the dutys thereof, for, if You had made but a slight inquisition into his inabilitys for Government, You would soon have discerned that privatively and positively he was utterly un∣qualified for the meanest Office of Power and Publick Trust instituted for the common benefit of humane Society, being destitute of all Moral Endowments requisite thereunto, and habitually propense to such Vices which to restrain from, and punish for, was a principal end of Erecting and Establi∣shing Government among Men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>Because soon after he was Instaled in his Office, his Address to Your Lordships, his Letters to Col. <HI>Colleton,</HI> Governour of <HI>Carolina,</HI> against <HI>Proprietor Southwel,</HI> to Sir <HI>Robert Robin∣son</HI> Governour of <HI>Burmudas,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Simon Musgrave,</HI> Atorney General at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and to Mr. <HI>Samuel Trott,</HI> Collector at <HI>Burmudas,</HI> being all stuff'd with Nonsensical Rallery, and nauceous scurrility, manifested him to be an impudent shat∣ter brained Idiot, fitter for <HI>Bedlam,</HI> or <HI>Bridewell,</HI> than any place of Authority; yet you continued him near four years in the Administration of that Suprem Office; wherein his whole managment hath been greatly to the dishonour of Your Lordships, and damage of the people inhabiting Your said Province.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>Because all his barbarous and unjust dealings with me, have been done by Colour of his Office, and by pretended Authority from Your Lordships, whose Names he hath con∣stantly used to imbolden his Agents in the Execution of his unlawful Precepts; <HI>Viz.</HI> To Imprison people without any cause, detain them during his pleasure, break their Houses and Rob them of their goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereby he hath Repre∣sented Your Lordships as a company of <HI>Nimrods,</HI> that delight in hunting men to destruction, and therefore send such beasts of prey to Rule over them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>Because <HI>Nicholas Trott</HI> (who succeeded <HI>Jones</HI> in the Govern∣ment of the said Province by Commission from Your Lord∣ships,)
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> denied me my Birth-right-priviledge, <HI>viz.</HI> the bene∣fit of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> for my own relief, and the Ex∣emplary punishment of my merciless oppressors; the chief of whom he preferred to places of great Dignity and Au∣thority in the Government, though guilty of, and accused for <HI>Trayterous and Felonious Conspiracys, Burglarys,</HI> and other heinous <HI>Crimes,</HI> and at the same time held me a close Pri∣soner, denying me Bail, and delaying my Tryal two months after he became Governour, though I had then been hardly imprisoned under <HI>Jones</HI> his Usurpation 14 months, and when I was cleared by Law, and in the King's Name demanded Le∣gal Process against <HI>Jones,</HI> and <HI>Graves;</HI> he permitted both to Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire out of the Province, whereby they have Escaped Demerited-punishment, and because the said <HI>Trott</HI> hath As∣sumed and Exercised an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Power over the Persons, Libertys, and Propertys of the Kings Sub∣jects inhabiting Your said Province, ever since he came to the Government.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>Because through the denials of Justice by Your Lordships Ministers at <HI>Providence,</HI> and <HI>Carolina;</HI> I am Necessitated to leave the Place of my Setled Habitation and Trade, my Lands, Houses, Goods, and Debts of great value, and to Ex∣pose my self to great Perril of Life and Liberty, and to great Expence of time and mony in Traveling 3000 miles over the <HI>Seas,</HI> viz. From <HI>Providence</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> to spread my deplorable <HI>Case</HI> before Your Lordships, to whom only (<HI>Trott</HI> saith) <HI>Jones</HI> is answerable for the male Administration of his Office; and by the Denials aforesaid, I am deprived of witnesses here <HI>[viva voce]</HI> to prove the matters of <HI>Fact</HI> which I have Aledged against them, and for which I am bound to prossecute.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>Because they who have the disposal of Offices for Admini∣stration of Justice, ought not to put into them any but such as are duely qualified, and for whom they will answer, the Law says <HI>Respondeat Superior,</HI> which is the reason why Se∣curity is required for such Officers before they can Execute their respective Offices; otherwise the Persons sustaining▪ damage by their ignorant or corrupt Errors, would be de∣stitute of remedy, whereby those Offices that are appointed for common benefit, would become the most Common and only Remediles grievances.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>Because Your Lordships (by whom <HI>Jones, Trott, Blake,</HI> &amp;c. were Vested with the said Offices and Exorbitant powers which Enabled and Imboldened them, their Abettors and Agents to do those <HI>Acts</HI> of monstrous Cruelty and Injustice to me, and whereby I have been deprived of the benefit of the Laws for my own relief, and their punishment) are be∣yond expression better able to repair my Losses and Damages, than I am to bear them, who have lost a Virtuous Wife (frighted to Death by the <HI>Burglarious</HI> and other Terrifying <HI>Acts</HI> of Violence done by the said <HI>Jones</HI> and his Complices) my own health, by hard and long Imprisonment, my whole Estate in Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as aforesaid; am put out of all manner of Employment, disabled to pay my Debts, and to betake my self to the Free and Publick Exercise of any Occupation, for maintaining my self and Offspring; or to be in any conside∣rable degree useful in my Generation, in which <HI>Case,</HI> Life is undesirable to a good man.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>The Exorbitant Powers (in the first f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>going Reason) said to be Confer'd by Your Lordships upon <HI>Jones,</HI> were that by Commission You impowered him, and by instructions directed him to appoint a Deputy to Each <HI>Proprietor</HI> ac∣cording to his pleasure, and every Deputy so appointed to be always a Member of the Grand Councel, and of the Up∣per House in the General Assembly, and to hold those Places of Dignity and Authority during his pleasure: And he with the consent of three Deputys of his own Election and ap∣pointment, to Ratify or Reject such Laws as should be chosen by the Peoples Representatives Convened in a General As∣sembly, also to Adjourn, Prorogue and Dissolve the Assembly at their Arbitrary will and pleasure, which Powers the said <HI>Jones</HI> hath corruptly used to the Subverting of the very Ends of Government, in appointing Indigent Illiterate and Vitious Men to be your Deputys; whereof some have been Notoriously guilty of Capital Crimes: These being introduced by his fa∣vour and holding their Places <HI>duranto bene placito,</HI> by their servile Compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance with him in his Arbitrary and oppressive Practices, and Trayterous Conspiracies, have furthered the Execution thereof, and frustrated the good Effect of all Le∣gal means used, for limiting his Exorbitant power, and Re∣dressing the Peoples intollerable grievances, under his Tyran∣ny. By the Advice and Consent of such dependent Creatures, he hath procured long Intermissions, undue Elections, and abrupt Dissolutions of General Assemblies, and thereby hath Defeated the chief Ends of the Constitution and Convention of that Supream Court, <HI>viz.</HI> Enacting beneficial Laws, Re∣dressing Grievances, and correcting the Exorbitances of per∣nitious Favorites and corrupt Ministers of State</P>
<P>To evince the truth of what is said concerning his choice of Deputys, I present Your Lordships with a Catalogue of the Names, and a description of the Persons who were ap∣pointed
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> to be Your Deputys, by <HI>Cadwallader Jones,</HI> in the time of his Tyrannical Government of Your said Province, <HI>viz.</HI> from the 19th day of <HI>June Anno</HI> 1690. to the 16th day of <HI>April</HI> 1694. <HI>viz.</HI> Himself, whose discription you have had before; <HI>Bartholomew Mercier,</HI> an indigent <HI>French</HI> Alien, and a Robber of <HI>French Protestant</HI> Refugees; <HI>John Graves,</HI> a per∣petual Incendiary; <HI>Gilbert Ashley, Bowen Clasen, Allen Abbot,</HI> a Pirate, <HI>Timothy Rumney,</HI> a reputed <HI>Papist,</HI> [the two last were chosen Deputys to strengthen a Conspiracy to Banish <HI>Bulkley,</HI> for opposing <HI>Jones</HI> his Tyranny in a Parliamentary way] <HI>Richard Holloway, Daniel Jackson,</HI> a Notorious Pirate; <HI>Martin Cock,</HI> a servant to a <HI>Punch</HI>-house-keeper; <HI>Thomas Cum∣ber,</HI> an Illiterate man, who could not write his own Name; <HI>Thomas Peck, Thomas Williams,</HI> a Notorious Pirate; <HI>Ashley</HI> and <HI>Clasen</HI> (being sencible and sober men) were displaced by <HI>Jones,</HI> and <HI>Halloway</HI> avoided the same fate, by going to <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>That the Character I have given of <HI>Jones</HI> may be Evident∣ly verified, I have inserted his Letter to Mr. <HI>Samuel Trott,</HI> and the Answers thereunto, also Sir <HI>Peter Colleton</HI>'s Letter to <HI>Jones,</HI> as a Specimen thereof, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>

<P>YOur Letter directed to Governour would be of the <HI>Bahaman's</HI> and his Counsel, hath come to my hand; and I (having a great respect for the person to whom it was sent) thereupon held my self obliged to give my own and others thoughts of that Letter. The stile of your verses I much admire, but they run not very smooth, thro' the inequality of their Feet; a certain person who had a sight of them, said, if a School-boy seven years old had writ such stuff, he would have Jerk'd him till he Beshit himself.</P>
<P>Your said Letter hath produced various Effects here, for in all Companies (when merrily disposed) we have News from <HI>Nassau.</HI> The Women have it too, and use it instead of <HI>Raw Head and Bloody Bones</HI> to Affright their <HI>Children</HI> out of cross grain'd Humours.

<HEAD>A Letter from Sir <HI>Peter Colleton</HI> (then a <HI>Proprietor</HI> of <HI>Carolina</HI> and the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands) to <HI>Cadwallader Jones,</HI> Governour of the said Islands, Directed for him, in <HI>Providence,</HI> as followeth,</HEAD>

<P>Coll. Jones,</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Wrote to you by <HI>Coll. Ludwell,</HI> since when no Oppertunity hath presented until now, I have read several Letters from you, and have also had the perusal of your <HI>Pacquet</HI> Directed to the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Craven,</HI> and take notice of the Letters you writ to Mr. <HI>Musgrave,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Trott,</HI> in which <HI>Pacquet,</HI> Coppys of them were inclosed; and have also seen the Coppy of the Letter you wrote to Sir <HI>Robert Robertson,</HI> Governour of <HI>Barmudas;</HI> I was in hopes you had seen your Error in writing such Letters as that was to Sir <HI>Robert;</HI> But those you sent since to <HI>Simon Musgrave,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Trott,</HI> Convince the Lords you have not; but persist in the same indiscretion: For no man that sees these Letters, but must conclude they came from the Pen of a Man out of his sences; And that you Expose, the Reputation of the Lords by them: For what will the world think of their Em∣ploying a Man as Governour, that hath no more prudence than to send such Extravagant Letters, up and down the world, and send Coppys of them to the Lords <HI>Proprietors,</HI> that they also may be witnesses of his Indiscretion. They (to vindicate themselves) have thought fit to Impower Mr. <HI>Nicholas Trott</HI> to be Governour of the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands, to whom you are to Sur∣render the Government: I am heartily sorry it should so fall out, The Lords have a great kindness and respect for you, and will be willing to do what is in their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer for you, but they are answer∣able to the King for the good Government of the Places granted to them, and cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t answer the not doing what they have now done. Write me what you think may be of advantage for you, that they can do, and I will get it dispach'd for you: I am your very Affectionate Friend.</P>

<P><HI>My Lords,</HI></P>
<P>THE Sufferings that undeservedly I have undergon by the Oppression and Injustice of your Ministers, (<HI>viz. Jones, Trott,</HI> and your Deputys Chosen and Appointed by them) have been so Great, and continued so Long, that I cannot digest them, therefore I have waded through great Difficulties and Dangers in coming from <HI>Providence</HI> to <HI>England</HI> for Redress. And since my Arival here, I have truly represented my Case to your Lordships, so as would move the Hearts of every one (that is not degenerated from Christianity, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rality, and Humanity) with pitty to the Oppressed, and Indignation against the Barba∣rous Oppressors. As to my self, when I reflect upon the resent∣ment Expressed by all the tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> (the Culpable only ex∣cepted) in the <HI>Levites</HI> Case, Recorded in the Sacred History, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>20th Chap.</HI> of <HI>Judges,</HI> from the <HI>1st</HI> to the <HI>14.</HI> Verse, I am filled with Astonishment at your strange Ʋnaffectedness with the Relation that hath been made to you of the Agents Monstrous Villanies, and the patients dreadful Sufferings in this Case (which far exceeds the <HI>Levits</HI> in heinous Aggravations) especially if you consider how much you have contributed to both, by putting the too Edged Sword of Supreme Authority into the hand of an Indigent-Vitious-Frantick-Fool, who hath daily used it to the dishonour of your Lordships, and destruction of the Kings best Subjects inhabiting your Province, ever since he was admitted to the Government, and above all others to the ruin of me, who once more apply my self to you for Redress, the which if you do not speedily grant me, I shall be obliged to bring
