<HEAD>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here are many, who having read <HI>Plato</HI>'s Commonwealth, Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI>'s <HI>Ʋtopia,</HI> the Lord <HI>Verulam</HI>'s <HI>New Atlantis,</HI> (which are but Ideas and ingenious fancies) are apt to suspect all relatons of new discove∣ries to be of that kind; and chiefly when they find in them any thing extraordinary and wonderful. But although these persons are to be commended for being wary and cautious, yet it is but so long as they keep within the bounds of mo∣deration,
<PB REF="3"/>
and do not pass to the excess of incredulity. For as some men, through a believing simplici∣ty, are easily imposed upon, and receive that for a truth, which in effect is not one: So others, on the contrary, through a contrary hu∣mour, are apt to reject, as fabulous, that which often proves to be a real truth. This clearly appears in the case of <HI>Vergilius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Collen,</HI> who was like to have suffered a severe punishment for affirming, that <HI>There were Antipodes;</HI> neither could any thing save him but a publick Re∣cantation. <HI>Columbus</HI> was looked up∣on (here in <HI>England,</HI> and afterward in <HI>France)</HI> as a brain-sick Fellow for saying, <HI>There was Land on the West parts of the Ocean:</HI> Yet the Voyages since made round the World have justified <HI>Vergilius</HI> his opinion: And the discovery of <HI>America</HI> (where we have many flourishing Plantations)
<PB REF="3"/>
has sufficiently evidenced the truth of <HI>Columbus</HI> his Assertion. The Histories of <HI>Peru, Mexico, China,</HI> &amp;c. were at first taken for Romances by many, but time has shewed since that they are verities not to be doubted of.</P>
<P>Those remote Countries were for thousands of years unknown to the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> and so are still many others perhaps, and at this day we know little more of them, than what lies upon the Sea-coasts. But how should we have a perfect knowledge of remote Countries, lately discovered, since there are many parts of <HI>Europe</HI> very little known yet, and some not at all? Nay, the <HI>British</HI> Islands are not per∣fectly described: And before their last Civil Wars, the <HI>Highlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> many parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and other smaller Isles about, were very little known to the People of <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
And their Customs, Laws, and Religion, are things we have not yet had any very good account of. Few Travellers make it their busi∣ness to write Histories, and make descriptions of those Countries they have travelled in, for most of them being Merchants, or Sea∣men, they mind little more than their Trade; and being intent up∣on gain and profit, seldom busie themselves in making observations. Besides, few of them are qualified for the writing of Books if they were never so willing; and fewer have time and opportunity to apply themselves to that study; so it falls out, that we have few exact relati∣ons of remote Countries, although they be often seen, and even de∣scribed in Maps. For an Instance, The Isle of <HI>Borneo</HI> lies near <HI>Java,</HI> and in the way to <HI>China,</HI> it is one of the biggest in the world according to
<PB REF="4"/>
Geographical Descriptions, and yet we have very little knowledge of it, although the <HI>Dutch</HI> have very large Dominions in <HI>Java,</HI> and other Islands about it, and sail daily by it in their way to <HI>Jappan</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> Many other places there are which Sailers take no more notice of than as it is necessary for their Ships to avoid them. And how can it be ex∣pected we should have any good de∣scriptions of them, unless some great Powers should undertake it, and send fit persons for that purpose, with all the helps and encourage∣ment requisite in so useful and ho∣nourable a design? Among all re∣mote Countries, there is none so vast, and so little known, as the third Continent, commonly called, <HI>Terra Australis.</HI> It is true, Geogra∣phers give some small and unperfect descriptions of it, but it is with little knowledge and certainty; and
<PB REF="5"/>
most of their draughts may be su∣spected, and look'd upon, as ima∣ginary and fictitious. Sure it is, that there is such a Continent; many have seen it, and even landed there, but few durst venture far in it, if any there were; and I do not think that any body hath made any true description of it, either for want of knowledge, or other necessary means and opportunities.</P>
<P>This History will supply that de∣fect, in a great measure, if it be true, as I have reason to believe upon these grounds:</P>
<P>First, Upon the testimony of the Reporter, who doth not only here∣in affirm this History to be true, but did it also by word of mouth, a good while before, and again near the time of his death, when he gave his Papers to the Gentleman, who did lately put them into my hands. These two Gentlemen came to know
<PB REF="5"/>
one another at <HI>Smirna,</HI> a little be∣fore the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet departed from thence, in or about the year 1607. and being both bound for <HI>Holland;</HI> they came together in the same Ship where by a daily converse they contracted a very strict friend∣ship. This Fleet being attacked in its return, there were many men killed and wounded; and among the rest, the Author of this Relati∣on, called Captain <HI>Siden,</HI> was mor∣tally wounded, and lived but little after the fight.</P>
<P>Upon his death-bed he made his Friend Heir of what he had in the Ship, and spake to him in this man∣ner: as the Gentleman, himself, hath often declared to me.</P>
<Q>Sir, Since it is Gods Decree that I should live no longer, I patiently submit to his Divine Will without any murmur∣ing. But before I die, I am willing to
<PB REF="6"/>
dispose of a Chest I have in this Ship, where you will find some Money, and a few Jewels, of no great value, I con∣fess, but such as they are I give them to you, and I am sorry they are not better worth your acceptance, I give you also the Chest, and every thing in it; and though, it seems, the whole is worth but little, yet you will find a great Treasure in it, and that is the History of my Adventures in the South Continent, as you have heard me relate to you several times. You will find it in a great disorder and confusion for the most part; and written in several Languages, as being intended only to serve for memoires till I could digest them into an orderly contexture. But since God will not permit me to do it my self, I commit it to your care, knowing you are an ingenious person, and give you full power and authority to dispose of the said Papers as you will think most convenient; assuring you upon my death bed, as I have done before in several discourses, that
<PB REF="6"/>
they contain nothing but truth; which, I hope, time and further experience will bring to light.</Q>
<P>These were the last words of the dying Gentleman, who a few hours after gave up his Soul to God; and who, according to his Friends testimony, was a very sober, discreet, and worthy Person.</P>
<P>After his Death his Heir exa∣mined the Papers, and found they were written, for the most part, in <HI>Latine;</HI> the rest in <HI>French, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Provencal;</HI> the diversity of which Languages put him to a great deal of trouble, for he did not un∣derstand them all, neither was he willing to trust the Writings into Strangers hands. These difficul∣ties, together with the confusion of the Wars that followed, and seve∣ral troublesome Affairs, were the reason why he kept this History
<PB REF="7"/>
concealed all this while, not know∣ing whom to trust it with. But being come from <HI>Holland</HI> into <HI>Eng∣land</HI> since the Peace was proclaimed betwixt the two Nations; and ha∣ving contracted some acquaintance and friendship with me, he did me the favour a while ago to intrust me with his Papers, and desired my assistance in putting them into an orderly method. I perused them, and found the matter, therein contained, so extraordinary and wonderful, that I was never at rest till I had disposed them into a good order and contexture; which I, at last, effected, not without much la∣bour and pains, with the Gentlemans help and counsel.</P>
<P>Now we were a while uncertain in what Language we should pub∣lish this History, he being inclined to do it in <HI>Latine,</HI> or <HI>French:</HI> But at last I prevailed with him, and
<PB REF="7"/>
perswaded him to let me Print it in <HI>English,</HI> taking the whole task upon my self.</P>
<P>But before we proceeded in that design, I was desirous to enquire after the truth of this discovery some other way, and told him it were very material to send into <HI>Holland,</HI> to know of the Officers of the Admiralties there, whether any such Ship, as the <HI>Golden Dragon,</HI> herein mentioned, was at any time gone from thence for <HI>Batavia:</HI> To which he readily answered, he had satisfied himself therein, and found upon examination, that a Vessel of that name was gone from the <HI>Texel,</HI> at the time herein expres∣sed, with all the other Circum∣stances. But this was not enough to satisfie me, because I had no∣thing but his bare Affirmation: I therefore went to Mr. <HI>Van Dam,</HI> Advocate to the <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/></P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
But this could not be done, because the Dutch Gentleman was then in <HI>Flanders;</HI> whereupon he intreated him to write to him, and desire him to give the best account he could of it; which he readily con∣sented to, and having sent a Let∣ter to his Friend concerning this matter, received the following an∣swer, which we have faithfully translated out of <HI>French,</HI> and inser∣ted it here.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>ACcording to your desire, and for your Friends satisfaction, I shall tell you; that when I was at</HI> Batavia, <HI>in the year</HI> 1659, <HI>a</HI> Dutch <HI>Seaman, named</HI> Prince, <HI>hearing that I had been near the South-Continent, told me, that some years before (I do not remember how many, nor at what height) he was cast away in a new Ship, called the</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>
Green, <HI>or</HI> Golden Dragon; <HI>which carried a great deal of Money, designed for</HI> Batavia, <HI>and about four hundred people; who for the most part had got into the said Land, and kept there the same Discipline they had at Sea. That having entrenched themselves, with what they had saved, and among the rest, most of their Victuals, they made a new Pinnace out of the broken pieces of their Ship, casting Lots for eight men (whereof this Seaman was one) to go to</HI> Batavia, <HI>to inform the General of the</HI> Holland <HI>Company of their disaster, to the end he might send Ships to fetch those who had been cast away. That Pin∣nace being come to</HI> Batavia, <HI>with much ado; The said General dispatched pre∣sently a Frigot, which being come to that Coast, they sent their long Boat ashore with many men, who landed at the place and height to them described before, but found no body there. They ranged along that Coast till they lost their Boat, and</HI>
<PB REF="9"/>
<HI>some of their men, through the badness of the weather, which that Coast is very subject to, and so returned to</HI> Batavia <HI>without effecting any thing. The Ge∣neral sent a second Frigot, which like∣wise came back, with no better success than the former. People speak different∣ly of that Country, some saying, that in the Inland, there are People of a great Stature; others, that they are little and subtile, and that they carry those they can catch into the inner parts of the Land along with them. I was like to have landed there, but, as through Gods special favour, a sudden calm in the night saved us from being cast away; soon after a sudden storm made us alter our minds of landing there, and we thought our selves happy to get to Sea again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This is all I can tell you of this business: Your Friends may hear more of this Ship from those who belong to the</HI> East-India <HI>Company. General</HI>
<PB REF="9"/>
Maetsuycker <HI>was then, and is still, General in</HI> Batavia; <HI>but I had this account only of the Seaman above men∣tioned. The Land of this Country is reddish, and barren, and the Coasts as if they were enchanted by reason of frequent storms, which hinder much those who will land there: And that is the reason why the aforesaid Frigots lost their Boats and men. They could not land every where; and this Seaman is of opinion, they could not find the right place. I remain</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>This is the true Copy of the Letter sent to this French Gentle∣man, who has given me the Ori∣ginal and I have it still in my possession. He added, That the
<PB REF="10"/>
<HI>Savoyard</HI> took a Copy of it, and told him, that he himself had made great enquiry after a Gen∣tleman of his Country, who was said to have gone in this Ship. That the same Gentleman had been a great Traveller, and had left an Estate near <HI>Nice de Pro∣vence,</HI> where he was born, and that his Kindred, not having heard from him for many years, were much troubled to know what was become of him. All these things are, in my opinion, very strong Arguments to establish the truth of this History, since they agree so well with the History it self in all the Circumstances of Time, Place, and Person, and are attested by so many credible Wit∣nesses, which are yet alive, for the most part, and who living in several places, not knowing one another, and having no interest in
<PB REF="10"/>
the publishing of this Story, can∣not rationally be suspected, to have all joyned together to give credit to a Fictitious Nar∣ration. But I leave the Reader to the liberty of using his own Judgment, and content my self with shewing the Reasons which have been able to convince mine. I wish that those who shall read this most delightful and admi∣rable Relation may reap some pro∣fit out of it either in point of Pleasure or Utility, it being a very ingenious Piece, and the most perfect model of Government I ever read or heard of in my life.</P>

<HEAD>The History of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> or <HI>Sevarambi.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y, Natural Genius, the man∣ner of my Education, and the Example of others, in∣spired me in my young years with a restless desire of tra∣velling the World, that I might my self be an Eye Witness of those things I had either read or heard of. But the Authority of my Parents, who designed me for the Gown, and my want of sufficient means, were powerful Obstacles to my de∣sires; and would have confined me at home, had not fortune, mightier than all these, ordered it contrary to their intent, and according to my wishes. For before I had attained the fifteenth year of my age, I was sent into <HI>Italy,</HI> in a Military Imploy∣ment, which kept me there two whole years before I came home again into my own Country; from whence, soon after my Re∣turn, I was obliged to march into <HI>Catalonia</HI> with a better Command than that I had be∣fore. I continued there in the Army for the
<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
space of three years, and would not have quitted the Service, if my Fathers untimely Death had not called we home again to take possession of a small Estate he left me, and to obey my Mothers absolute Commands, who called me back, as the only person, after so great a loss, that was able to dry up her tears.</P>
<P>These Considerations made me to re∣turn; and after that, to leave the Sword, and to put on the Gown, and change a Souldiers life for that of a Lawyer; to which study upon this occasion I did wholly apply my self; read the Institutions, the Codex, and the Digests or Pandects, where having made a pretty good progress in four or five years time I was perswaded to take my De∣grees in the University, which I did accord∣ingly with an indifferent good success. Then was I received into the Soveraign Court of Judicature of my Country in the quality of an advocate, as being the first step to higher dignities, exercised my self in Declamations upon fictitious Causes, and pleaded real and choice ones in <HI>Apparatu,</HI> as they term it, with some applause and credit. I was well enough pleased with these kinds of exercises, in which young men love to shew their Wit and Eloquence to the Publick, and where
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
they get more praise than money; But when I descended to the lower practice of the Law, I found it so crabbed, so mean and slavish, that in a short time I was quite weary of it. I carefully examined the ways and means by which Lawyers attain to Riches and Dignities, and found there was much of fraud and indirect proceeding in them, and that unless I did comply with men of that Calling in all these vices, I should never get either Wealth or Credit by my practice. Now being naturally inclined to Ease and Pleasure, and loving frankness and honesty, I clearly perceived I was no ways fit for that Imployment. So while I was thinking and contriving how to cast it off with some plau∣sible reason, a fatal accident took away my loving Mother; and although her death made me absolute Master of my self and Estate, yet it laid so much grief and sorrow on my heart, that all things at home became odious to me, insomuch that I made a strong resolution to leave my Native Land, if not for ever, at least for a long time.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this design, I disposed of all my Concerns, except of a small Estate in Land, which I reserved for a place of retreat in case of necessity, leaving it in the hands of a faithful Friend, who ever since gave me a
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
very good account of it so long as he could hear from me. Having in that manner or∣dered my affairs and taken leave of my best friends, I travelled into the chiefest Pro∣vinces of the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> 'till I came to the famous City of <HI>Paris,</HI> where I spent al∣most two years without going above fifty or sixty Miles from it. But the former desire of seeing more Countries, and an opportunity while I was there of travelling into <HI>Germany</HI> made me depart from that Populous City to go and see the several Courts of the Ger∣man Princes, those of the Kings of <HI>Swede∣land</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> and at last the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> where I made an end of my <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> travels, and rested my self, till the year 1655. in which I took shipping for the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The causes and motives which induced me to take this long Voyage were these:</P>
<P>First, My natural curiosity of seeing Countries, and the wonderful relations I had heard or read of those remote parts of the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, The earnest solicitations of a Friend who had a concern in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and was bound for that place.</P>
<P>And last of all, The great gain and pro∣fits which I was told would accrue to me
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
by this Voyage if it should prove success∣ful.</P>
<P>These Arguments and Invitations easily prevailed with me, so that having in a short time ordered my affairs, and prepared my self for this purpose, I went with my friend aboard a new Ship, called the <HI>Golden Dra∣gon,</HI> bound for <HI>Batavia.</HI> She was a Vessel of about six hundred Tuns, and thirty two Guns, and carried near four hundred People Seamen or Passengers, and great Sums of Money, where my Friend, called <HI>Monsieur de Nuits,</HI> had a great concern.</P>
<P>In order to our Voyage we weighed An∣chor from the <HI>Texel</HI> on the twelfth day of <HI>April</HI> 1655. and with a fresh Easterly Wind sailed through the Channel betwixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> with all the speed and good success we could wish, till we came to the open Seas, and thence prosecuted our Voyage to the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands with variety of Winds and weather, but no Storms or Tempests.</P>
<P>There we took in fresh Provisions, such as the Islands afford, and which we had oc∣casion for; and steering from thence to∣wards the Isles of <HI>Capo verdo</HI> to fetch a con∣stant Trade Wind, we came in sight of them without any accident worth my relating It is true, we saw several Sea Monsters, flying
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
Fishes, new Constellations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But because those things are usual, that they have been described by others, and have for ma∣ny years lost the grace of Novelties, I pur∣posely omit them, not being willing to in∣crease the Bulk of this Book with unnecessary relations which would but tire the Readers patience and my own.</P>
<P>To proceed therefore with my intended brevity, I think it will be sufficient to tell you that we made the Coasts of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and got there another Trade Wind, which car∣ried us towards the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> with indifferent good success. We doubled the Cape without any danger, and pursued our Voyage with all chearfulness and alacrity, till we came to 38 degrees of South Latitude, on the Second day of <HI>August</HI> of the same year 1655.</P>
<P>Till this time and place Fortune had smi∣led upon us, but now she began to frown, for about three or four a clock in the after∣noon the Sky began to change its former clearness and serenity into thick Clouds, Lightnings and Thunders, which were the forerunners of the vehement Winds, Rain, Hail and Tempest, which succeeded soon after. The very approach of this violent storm did much terrifie our Seamen, and although
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
they had time to take down their Sails, tie fast their Guns, and order every thing as they thought fit, yet foreseeing the terrible Hurricane that hapned immediately after, they could not chuse but dread the violence and fierceness of it.</P>
<P>The Sea began to foam, and turn its smooth Surface into Mountains and Vales. The Winds ran all the points of the Com∣pass in less than two hours time. Our Ship was tossed to and fro, up and down again, in the horridest manner imaginable; one Wind drove us forward, and another beat us back again; our Masts, Yards, and Tackling were broken, and the storm was so violent that a great part of our Seamen being sick could hardly hear and obey command.</P>
<P>All this while our Passengers were kept under Deck, and my Friend and I lay at the main Mast sadly cast down, and both re∣penting, he for his covetous desire of gain, and I for my foolish curiosity. We wished our selves a hundred times in <HI>Holland,</HI> and as often despaired ever to see it again, or any other Land, for any would have served our turn then. He was a very honest young man, but no Souldier nor Seaman. At the begin∣ing of the storm I was full of courage, and well resolved to submit to the will of God
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
without any murmuring or fear of dying, but he did not understand that Philosophy, the dreadful image of Death appeared to him with all his horrour, and I think I might have seen it in his face if we had not been in the dark. I have admired he did not die for the very fear of it: At first he sigh'd and and groaned only, but a while after, when the storm increased, he broke out into the saddest howling in the world.</P>
<P>He accused his Fathers Counsel and Com∣mand, who had sent him, but chiefly his own folly in obeying. He called his dear Mother, Brothers, and Sisters, and bad them an Eternal Farewel, as likewise his beloved Country, which he had no hopes ever to see again. He lamented and deplored the cruelty of his Fate that put an end to his life in the flower of his Age by so horrid and untimely a Death. In fine, he made such sad com∣plaints, and was so eloquent in his affliction, that I was moved with Compassion more than with the fear of being drowned. Pity first wrought upon my heart, and drove out of it all the Stoicity my reason had laid there in store; then fear and infirmity came in, so that I began to howl and lament with my afflicted Friend, as if I had been as weak as he, and had it not been for some ridiculous
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
Expressions of his, which made me some∣times laugh, I think I had been as much de∣jected as he.</P>
<P>Mans weakness and simplicity is much to be admired in such occasions as this, and shews that Custom, Prejudices, and Opinions, have more influence upon his mind than true reason he so much boasts of, and which in such occurrences as this forsakes him, and leaves the mastery of his Soul to weak and silly Pas∣sions. Death is but one and the same thing what shape soever it assumes to appear in, and we commonly fear the manner of Death more than Death it self.</P>
<P>Before this storm (wherein none of our People perished by the special Grace of God) I had been exposed to a great deal more dan∣ger than I was now; I had been exposed to the mouth of Canons, I had fought in Bat∣tels, and in Sieges, where many thousands of men had lost their lives, and where we marched upon the slain to a seeming inevita∣ble Death: Yet the fear of it did hardly make an Impression on my heart because it was an usual thing, and the contempt of dan∣ger as much accounted courage and gallantry as the fear of it cowardliness and infamy, yet death is still but one and the same thing.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
While my Friend and I were thus lament∣ing, the Master and his Crew were not asleep, neither did they neglect any thing that could contribute to our preservation; They used all their art, and all their endea∣vours, some about the Stern, some about the Pumps, and others about several other parts of the Ship; and God did so bless their labour, that they kept her up while the vio∣lent Hurrricane lasted, which at last fell into one particular Wind, that got the mastery of the others, and drove us to the South∣ward with so great rapidity that we were not able to keep out of that Course, but must yield to his violence. After two days running that Course the Wind changed a little, and drove us to the Southeast for the space of three days, the weather being so foggy that we could see nothing at five or six yards distance. On the sixth day the Wind slaked a little, but drove us still to the Southeast till towards night, when of a sudden we felt a very great Calm, just as if our Ship had fallen into a Pool or dead Lake, which caused no small wonder in us. Two or three hours after we were thus be∣calmed the weather cleared up, and we spied a great many Stars, but could not make any good observation by them. We judged
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
in general that we were not far from <HI>Bata∣via,</HI> and a great many Leagues from the South Continent: But it proved afterwards we were much deceived in our Conjecture. The seventh day we continued in this great Calm, as if we had been ordered to cele∣brate the Sabbath day after six days labour and toyl; during this Calm we searched and examined all the parts of our Ship, and found her pretty tight, though she was a new Ship, and had never gone a Voyage before. But she was so strongly built that she endured the rage of the Seas without springing any Leak able to endamage her. The eighth day at Noon a fine breeze began to blow, and drove us to the Eastward, much to our joy and satisfaction, for besides that it made for our purpose, we were afraid of being be∣calmed; at night the weather grew dark and misty, and the Wind stiff and violent, so that we feared another storm The Fog continued all the day following, and the wind blowing by fits and puffs, which did sometimes put us to great danger, at night the Wind changed, grew boisterous and drove us again to the Southeast with great impetuosity, the Fog growing still thicker and thicker. About the middle of the night, the Wind being very high, and our Ship
<PB N="12" REF="17"/>
running very swiftly, she struck of a sudden upon a Bank, much contrary to our ex∣pectation, and stuck there so fast that she remained there without any motion as if she had been nailed to the place. Then did we think our selves absolutely lost, and looked every moment to see our Ship staved in pieces by the fury of the Seas and Wind, and every body fell to his Prayers seeing neither Art nor Industry could avail. But God, whose mercies are great, shewed us salvati∣on where we expected nothing but destru∣ction; for the Morning being come, and the Sun having expelled the darkness of the Night, and dissipated the thickness of the Fog, we saw that our Vessel stuck upon a Bank near the shore of a great Island or Continent. The discovery of this Land turned our despair into hopes, for although it was unknown to us, and we could not tell what good or bad fortune we should have in it: Yet any Land was then welcome to men who had during many days been so mi∣serably tossed upon the water betwixt life and death, hopes and despair.</P>
<P>About Noon the weather grew very clear and hot, the Sun over-powring the Mist and Fog, and the Wind abating much of his violence, so that the Sea did by degrees
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
lose much of his rage and agitation. In the Afternoon about three a Clock it Ebbed from the shore, and left our Ship with less than five foot of water upon a kind of a muddy Sand where she stuck very fast. The place where she stuck was not above a Musket shot from a pretty high but accessible shore, whither we resolved to remove our selves and our goods whatever should come on't, and in order to it our Long-boat was let down, and twelve of our stoutest men were sent ashore well armed to discover the Coun∣try, and to chuse a place near the Sea where we might encamp with some safety without going far from our Ship. As soon as they were landed they carefully viewed the Coun∣try from the top of a rising ground not far from the shore, but saw neither Houses, nor Inhabitants, nor any signs of either, the Country being but a Sandy barren Land, where grew nothing but bushes and little shrubs wild and savage. They could see nei∣ther River nor Brook in the parts they had discovered; and not having time to make a farther search that day, nor counting it pru∣dence to venture any farther into so unknown a place, they came back again to the Ship three hours after their landing. The next Morning we sent them ashore again with
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
provisions, and order to send the Boat back again to fetch our People by degrees, and likewise our Provisions and Goods, which were all whole by Gods mercy without any the least damage. All these Orders were exe∣cuted with great care and diligence, so that the day after our being cast upon the Bank we got all ashore with a good part of our Provisions and Goods most useful and neces∣sary. The first who landed pitched the Camp on the side of a rising ground near the Sea over against our Vessel, which could co∣ver us on the Land side from being seen by any body that should come towards the shore, and afforded us a convenient station for a Sentinel to discover a good way round about. Thither did we by degrees carry our goods, leaving in the Ship but ten or twelve men to keep her till we could tow her off up∣on high water, if it was possible, or dispose of her otherwise.</P>
<P>One of the first things we did so soon as we were landed was to call a Council, to ad∣vise what order we should take for our mu∣tual preservation. It was presently resolved that we should keep for the present upon the Land the same order and discipline we kept at Sea, till such times we should think fit to alter it; so after this resolution it was
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
agreed, we should humble our selves before God Almighty, to give him most hearty thanks for preserving our lives and goods in so special a manner, and to implore his di∣vine assistance for the future in a place alto∣gether unknown to us, and where we might fall into the hands of some barba∣rous people, or starve there for want of Pro∣visions, if he in his mercy did not provide for us as he had done heretofore.</P>
<P>After this Resolution and humiliation our Officers divided our People into three equal parts, whereof two were ordered incessant∣ly to work about the Camp in drawing of a Trench to secure us from any sudden inva∣sion, and the others were imployed in dis∣covering the Country, and fetching in Wood and such kind of supplies. Those who were left aboard the Ship had orders to see what condition she was in, and what could be done with her. After an exact exa∣mination they found that her Keel was broke by the violent shock she gave against the Sand, and that she stuck so fast in it, that it was impossible to tow her off if she were ne∣ver so sound, so that they thought the best way was to take her in pieces, and build a Pinnace or two out of her ruines to sent to <HI>Batavia</HI> with all speed and diligence. That
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
Counsel was approved of, and the fittest men for that purpose were employed for the execution of it with all diligence. The parties that were sent to discover durst not venture far in the Plain for fear of some dan∣ger or ill accident, till such a time that the Camp was better fortified, and the Guns carried thither from the Ship. They brought in only Wood, and some kind of wild Ber∣ries, of which they found great quantities upon the bushes and shrubs of the place; some spreading along the shore found a very great plenty of Oysters, Muscles, and other Shell fish, which did not only refresh our People, but did also much save our Provisions, which upon examination we found could not hold out above two Months according to the ordinary allowance: The considera∣tion whereof made us think of some way to husband it, which could be but by getting and saving. In the first place we used all di∣ligence to get our Nets and Hooks ready, for we had found that the Sea thereabouts was very full of fish; we fed as much as we could upon the Berries of the Plain, and upon the Shell fish of the shore; and on the other side we shortned every ones allowance, and reduced it to eight ounces a day of the Ships Provisions. But our greatest want was
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
sweet water, for although we had made a Well in the Trench that afforded as much of it as we could use, yet it was somewhat brackish and ungrateful by reason of the near∣ness of the Sea.</P>
<P>Our adventurers made every day some new discovery, and having gone so far as almost Ten Miles about the Camp without finding any the least sign that the Country was inha∣bited grew every day bolder and bolder: They saw no living Creature in all this sandy Plain, but some Snakes, a kind of a Rat al∣most as big as a Rabbet, and some kind of Birds like wild Pigeons, but somewhat big∣ger, who fed upon the Berries we have made mention of. They killed some of them with their Guns and brought them to the Camp, where after trial they were found to be very good meat, especially the Birds.</P>
<P>These new discoveries made us a little re∣miss in our Fortifications, and we contented our selves by drawing a small Trench about our Camp, casting up the Earth inwardly, and thought it was enough in a place where we found no Inhabitants. We planted some Guns upon the most convenient places, and setting all thoughts of fear aside, dreaded no∣thing so much as hunger, and the injuries we might receive from the weather, which
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
we were not yet acquainted with, for it had proved very temperate since our Landing up∣on that Coast, where we had been fourteen days before our Pinnace could be perfected. But about the seventeenth day she was ready to put to Sea with Provision for Eight men for six weeks time, which was as much as ever we could spare. Now there arose great strife amongst the Seamen about the sending of the Pinnace to <HI>Battavia,</HI> for few would venture on that Voyage, yet it was necessary that some should go. Whereupon it was agreed that a number of the best Seamen should be taken out of the whole Crue, and that they should cast Lots among them∣selves to determine the difference, which was done accordingly. The Lot fell upon the Master himself, upon a Seaman called <HI>Prince,</HI> and six more, whose names I have forgotten. They seeing it was the will of Fortune that they should go, submitted to it joyfully, and after having agreed upon a Signal we should give them, to find us out if ever they should come again with relief, and taking their leave of the Company, they went aboard the Pinnace, and with a good Land Gale sailed to the Eastward till they were out of our sight. We made publick Prayers for their prosperity with many
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
sighs and tears, trusting in Gods goodness and mercy.</P>
<P>The same day we advised among our selves what kind of Government we should keep as most convenient for our present Con∣dition, for some of our Officers being gone in the Pinnace our Sea Discipline was some∣what altered, neither did we judge it pro∣per for the Land, upon better considera∣tion.</P>
<P>The business was debated <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con,</HI> but after some contestation it was agreed that we should live in a Military Discipline under a Captain General. And other inferiour Offi∣cers, which together should compose a So∣veraign Council of War with Authority to direct and order every thing absolutely. Now the question was whom we should chuse of all the Company. All were inclined to defer that honour to <HI>Van de Nuits,</HI> my Friend, as being the Person of most eminent quality among them, and who had the greatest concern in the Ship, but he modest∣ly excused himself, alledging that he was young and unexperienced in Military Affairs, and therefore not fit for such Command, and that it was necessary in such an occasion to make choice of a Person of riper years and greater experience in that kind than
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
himself was, who never was a Souldier. Then, observing some trouble and irresoluti∣ons in their faces, he went on in this manner:</P>
<Q><HI>Gentlemen, I give you many thanks for the esteem and good will you shew towards me, and wish heartily I were worthy of it, and capable of this Command; But since I cannot be your General my self, give me leave to recommend one to you who is very fit for that Imployment, having been a Commander in</HI> Europe <HI>in two se∣veral Armies and a great Traveller in most parts of the Christian World. You know his Per∣son, and I dare say you do all love and esteem of him as I do, although he is not so well known to you as he is to me, who have had long experi∣ence of his probity and good Conduct.</HI> Then (poynting to me) he said, <HI>The Person I mean is Captain</HI> Siden, <HI>to whose Command and Au∣thority I will readily submit if you please to chuse him for our General.</HI></Q>
<P>This unexpected Speech, and the looks of the Company, who all turned their eyes upon me, put me somewhat out of Coun∣tenance, but being soon come to my self, I answered, That his recommendation pro∣ceeded more out of affection and love than
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
out of any knowledge of either merit or good Conduct in me; that I was a Foreigner among them, and born in a Country far from <HI>Holland,</HI> and that I thought there were many in the Company far more capable of that Command than I was, and therefore desired to be excused, chusing rather to obey my betters than to use any Authority over them. I had no sooner ended my Speech, but one <HI>Swart</HI> (a stout and active fellow, who never went out of my company in all the discoveries we had made in the Coun∣try) took me up somewhat briskly, and said:
<Q><HI>Sir, All these excuses will not serve your turn, and if Mr.</HI> Van de Nuits <HI>counsel and mine be taken you shall be our General whether you will or no; for besides what he hath wor∣thily spoken of you, all the Company (and I particularly) know that since we were cast up∣on this Land you have shewed your self most active and industrious for the common good and preservation of all, and are therefore most fit to command us. We are Seamen and Traders, alto∣gether ignorant of Military Discipline, which you alone can teach us here, since there is no body among us that understands it, and who is so well qualified as your self, upon which consideration I</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
<HI>declare that you are the only sit person to com∣mand us, and that I will submit to no mans command but yours.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This blunt Fellows Speech, which he pronounced with a strong and loud voice, did so affect the minds of the Company, al∣ready disposed by <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> recommen∣dation, that all with one voice cried out, Captain <HI>Siden</HI> must be our General.</P>
<P>When I saw I could not avoid the taking of this Command, I made sign for silence, and spake to them in this manner:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen, Since you force me to accept of this Command, I accept it with thanks to you all, and do heartily wish your choice may prove to your advantage and satisfaction. But that all things may be done in good order, and carried on vigorously I beg a few things of you, which if you please to grant me I will do my best endeavour to preserve you from all danger, and to keep you in that Civil Discipline and Society which may best conduce to the Publick Good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The first thing I beg, That every man here will take an Oath to obey mine and the Councils Authority without any repugnancy, upon pain of such punishments as we shall think fit to inflict upon them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23"/>
<HI>The second is, That I may have the priviledge of chusing the Principal Officers to be elected, and they to bear such Commands and Offices as I shall bestow upon them for the time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the third place I beg, That in Council my single Vote may pass for three Votes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly, That I or my Deputy may have a Ne∣gative Voice in all Publick deliberations.</HI></P></Q>
<P>All these Priviledges and Prerogatives were presently granted me, and I was salu∣ted by all the Multitude in the quality of their General, and had a Tent larger than ordinary set up in the middle of the Camp for the first Badge of my Authority. I lay in it that night with <HI>Van de Nuits;</HI> and had his advice in several things, which were af∣terwards put in execution.</P>
<P>The next day we called all our People to∣gether, and in their presence I made <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> Over-seer General of all the Goods and Provisions we had, or should hereafter have. <HI>Swart</HI> Captain of the Artillery, Arms, and Ammunitions of War. <HI>Maurice,</HI> an ex∣pert and active Seaman, Admiral of our Fleet, which was to consist of a Long-boat, a little Boat, and another Pinnace we were a making out of the pieces of our broken Ship. <HI>Morton,</HI> an English man, who had
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
been a Serjeant in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> I made Captain of the Eldest Company. <HI>De Haes,</HI> a sober and vigilant fellow, was made second Captain, one <HI>Van Sluis,</HI> third Captain, one <HI>de Bosch,</HI> fourth Captain, and one <HI>Brown,</HI> Ma∣jor General.</P>
<P>I gave all these men leave to chuse their inferiour Officers with my approbation, which they did accordingly.</P>
<P>I had two Servants with me, the one cal∣led <HI>Devese,</HI> who had been my Serjeant in <HI>Ca∣talonia,</HI> a stout and understanding fellow, so∣ber, and trusty, who had served me ever since I left the Wars, and followed my fortune every where, him I made my Lieutenant General; and the other, named <HI>Tursi,</HI> my Secretary.</P>
<P>Our Officers being all chosen, we num∣bred our People, and found we were three hundred and seven Men, three Boys, and seventy four Women, all in good health; for although there were many of them sick when they first landed, they were all well again in less than a Weeks time, which was no small argument of the healthiness of the Country. I distributed all these into four parts, and gave <HI>Maurice</HI> six and twenty of the best Seamen, and the three Boys, to man his Navy. <HI>Swart</HI> had thirty for his Ar∣tillery.
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
I disposed two hundred men into four Companies, and <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> had all the rest to attend him, and take Orders of him in the Camp, or out of the Camp. We had two Trumpetters, which used to say Prayers in the Ship besides their Office of Trumpetting. I took one of them, and gave <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> the other, and they both were confirmed in both their imployments after the Dutch fashion.</P>
<P>All our Affairs being so ordered and set∣led, in the Evening I called our Superiour Officers together, and told them, that be∣fore our Provisions were all spent we should go about by Sea and Land to discover the Country, and endeavour to get some fresh Provision, as likewise to discover some fitter place for a Camp than that we were in, where in a short time all things would grow scarce, and where we had not so much as good water. That my opinion was we should send several Parties of men well Armed to make new discoveries, and go farther into the Country than we had gone yet. They readily assented to my Proposals, and told me they were ready to obey my Orders.</P>
<P>Whereupon I commanded <HI>Maurice</HI> to man his two Boats, and to send them all along
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
the Coasts, as far as they could conveniently go, the one, on the right side of the Camp, and the other, on the left. I ordered <HI>Morton</HI> to take twenty men out of his Company, and to go all along the shore on the left hand. <HI>De Haes</HI> was commanded to take thirty out of his, and to go through the middle of the Country; and I my self drew forty men out of the two other Companies, and left my Lieutenant to command in the Camp in my absence.</P>
<P>We all took three days Provision, and good store of Powder and Bullets, with Swords and half Pikes, and I commanded all my men to be ready early in the Morning, and to wait for further Orders, which they did accordingly. The next day, which was the twentieth since the first day of our Landing, and from which we shall hereafter reckon as our principal <HI>Epoche,</HI> all my men were ready by break of day, and came to receive my Commands, which were the same I had given the night before, with this Addition only: That if they should meet with any thing considerable they should pre∣sently send advice thereof to the Camp. I likewise gave Orders to <HI>Morton</HI> to keep with the Boat as near as he could, and to come every night to the shore to joyn with the
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
Boats-Crew before Sun setting, I my self intending to keep the same Method with <HI>Maurice.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as these Orders were given we went our several ways all full of hopes and alacrity. I marched my men in Rank and File, and I divided them into three Parties, the first that had the Van was composed of six Musketteers and a Corporal, the second of twelve and a Serjeant, I my self brought up the Rear.</P>
<P>We marched within Musket shot distance one from another in that manner as near the shore as we could, that we might be within sight of our Boat. The Sea was very calm, and the Weather very still, though something hot. At noon the Boat came to us at a place where we stood near the shore, and there we took some rest and refreshment for the space of two hours. All the Country we came upon for ten or twelve Miles was much like to that about our Camp, and we did not so much as find a Brook or a Spring in all our way, all being dry Sands, and nothing growing upon them but Bushes and Thorns. After we had taken some rest, we marched five Miles beyond the place where we had halted, and there the ground began to grow more unequal, and to rise here and there
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
into small Hills. Two Miles farther we found a Brook of sweet water, which gave us no small occasion of joy, chiefly when we saw that a little farther up in the Country there was some small plots of green Trees upon the Banks of the Brook; there we halted again, and made Signs to our Boat to come to us, which they did immediately, coming into the Brook with the Tide; and finding it was a very good Harbour for such a Vessel as theirs, they rowed up a Mile into the Land till they came to a plot of green trees, where we pitched our Camp for that night. <HI>Maurice</HI> brought us some Fish he had taken in the Sea, and some Oysters, and other Shell fish. We strook fire, went to Supper an hour before night, and then to sleep, keeping a good Guard about us, and hiding our fire with green Boughs we fixed in the ground round about it lest it should be seen at a distance. The next day early in the morn∣ing I sent three of my men back again to the Camp to give them notice of the Brook and the Trees we had found, and to tell them we intended to proceed farther. But before we removed from that place I sent five men up the Brook to discover more of the Coun∣try. They came back two hours after, and told us that the Country above was a little
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
more Hilly than below, but dry and barren, and like that which lay towards our Camp. Our Boat fell down towards the Sea after these men were come with this account, and had carried us over the Brook, which was deep and not fordable, unless we went two or three Miles higher. When we had got over we marched on along the shore still within sight of our Boat, and found that the Coun∣try grew more and more unequal.</P>
<P>When we had gone five or six Miles fur∣ther we came to a pretty high Hill, which was barren and without Trees. We got on the top of it, and from thence discovered a Wood of tall Trees four or five Miles be∣yond this Hill, which Trees stood upon a high ground that shot a good way into the Sea.</P>
<P>At the sight of these green Trees we did much rejoyce, and resolved to go thither after we had taken a little refreshment. We marched on through a Sandy Plain that lay betwixt us and the Wood, and reached the foot of the high ground in less than two hours time, got up into the Wood, and found it did consist of very lofty Trees, not thick, and under which there was not much under-wood, so that it was easily pervious; there I kept my men very close to one
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>
another, and doubled the Van, that they might be the more able to resist if they should be set upon by any men or fierce Beast. As we went we cut down several Boughs, and strewed them upon the ground, where∣by we might know the way we came in our return. In that manner we marched on in as direct a Line as we could till we came to the other side of the Wood, where we spied the Sea again, and saw Trees over the Water at six or seven Miles distance, which demon∣strated to us that this water was a great Bay between two Capes.</P>
<P>The place was very delightful to behold, and afforded a very fine prospect over the Bay, which made us wish we had been cast away nearer to it than we were. We had left our Boat on the other side of the Wood by reason of the great way she must go about before we could meet her again. I sent down ten of my men to the Water side, where they found a vast quantity of Oysters, and other Shel-fish, which was no small encouragement. As soon as they were come up I sent three men to <HI>Maurice,</HI> and bid him row as fast as he could towards the head of the Cape, where he should meet with a Party I intended to send immediately that way. I sent another Party towards the inner part of the Wood on the
<PB N="31" REF="27"/>
Land side to see if they could find any sweet water. Those who went towards the head of the Cape travelled almost two Miles before they found any, but at last they perceived a Declivity in the ground, which led them down into a kind of a Vale, very full of green and thick Trees, at the bottom of which they found a fine stream of sweet wa∣ter, running into the Bay. In this pleasant place they stopped, and sent three of their Company to bring me notice of it; they had not been come a quarter of an hour but the ten men, who were sent on the contrary side, came back again, and told us they had gone a great way in the Wood, which they thought grew wider and wider towards the Land; that they had found a Heard of Deer near a little Brook, whereof they had killed two, and shot at two more. They had cut these Deer into four pieces, and carried them upon their backs, which was no un∣comfortable sight to us. We left the place where we stood, and marched towards the Vale above mentioned, having before di∣spatched five of our men towards the Camp, to give them notice of what had hapned to us, and sent them part of our Venison for a token of the good Fortune we had met with. When we were come to the Vale, I
<PB N="32" REF="28"/>
liked it so well, that I resolved to encamp there that night, and to remove our old Camp thither, as soon as possibly we could. My men made presently a fire, and fell a roasting of their Venison; and I sent five of them to meet with the Party which were sent to <HI>Maurice;</HI> they marched but two Miles farther before they came to the head of the Cape, where they joyned with the other Party, and there standing all together, upon the most eminent place they could find, looked for <HI>Maurice</HI> his coming. He as soon as he had received my Orders, Rowed to the Rendezvous with all the diligence possible, and came to the place half an hour before Sun setting, where having pulled the Boat upon the ground, they all came to the new Camp before it was night.</P>
<P>They found us very merry, some about the fire roasting of meat, and others lying upon Beds of dry leaves and dry Moss, which they had gathered good store of in a little time.</P>
<P>We passed all the night in that place with a great deal of joy and quietness, and the morning being come I got up betimes, and bid <HI>Maurice</HI> and his Crew to prepare for the old Camp, whither I intended to return by Water with only two of my men besides
<PB N="33" REF="28"/>
the Boats Crew. I left one to Command the rest, and ordered him to keep in that place till he heard farther from me, promising to be with him again in less than three days, and that in the mean while they might supply their wants with Hunting, Fishing, and Shelling; so we went towards the Boat. We soon reached the place where she lay, put her to Sea, and Rowed to the old Camp the same day, a gentle breeze favouring our Voyage; we arrived about Sun setting, and were received by our People with general demonstrations of joy. They had heard of the new Camp, and all asked me if they should not remove thither? I answered, We would do that with all speed, it being the best place to pitch upon of all those we had seen.</P>
<P><HI>Morton</HI> and <HI>De Haes</HI> were come to the Camp two or three hours before my arrival, and came to give me an account of their Ex∣peditions.</P>
<P><HI>Morton</HI> told me, he had marched his men fifteen or sixteen Miles to the left side of the Camp through a Sandy and barren Country, where they had not found so much as a Spring or Brook of sweet Water; that at night they were gone to meet the Boat on the shore, according to my Orders, and lain
<PB N="34" REF="29"/>
there till the next morning, which being come, they departed early from that place, and proceeded to the Westward in the same manner as the day before, through a Rocky and Stony Country, without finding any water till Noon; at which time they came to a pretty broad River, where they stopt till their Boat came to them. That they had ob∣served the Tide came into this River with great noise and Impetuosity, and that the water was salt where they came to it at first, as being not far from the Sea, which had obliged them to go up the River till they should find sweet water. That going up along the Banks they had at the last found a Stream of sweet water, which refreshed them much, and so proceeded in their disco∣very; they had been set upon by two great Crocodiles, which ran out of the River to devour them, but that they having spied them before they could come near, had fired at them, and the report of their Guns had so frighted those Monsters that they ran into the water with more haste than they were come out of it. That seeing the danger there was along that River by reason of these, or other fierce Creatures they might meet with; and having no Provision to go on any fur∣ther in a Country where they could get
<PB N="35" REF="29"/>
nothing but some Shell-fish, and those only upon the Sea-shore, they thought they should proceed no farther, but come back again the same way they were gone, according to my Command of not staying longer without some special reason.</P>
<P><HI>De Haes</HI> told me he had marched twenty Miles the first day through a Sandy Plain, di∣rectly to the Southward. That at night they were come to a little Hill full of Heath, where they lay till next morning. That when the Sun began to shine they saw a very great Mist five or six Miles beyond their Post, which clearing up by degrees, as they marched towards it, they discovered a great Pool or Lake of standing water, which could be no less than ten Miles Diameter. That being come near this Lake they had seen abundance of Reeds and Rushes grow∣ing about the shore, and an infinite number of Water-Fowl, that flew from place to place, and made a very great noise in their flight.</P>
<P>That they had gone a good way about this Lake before they could come to touch the water by reason of the Marshy and Muddy ground about it, where they could not march without danger of sinking, till they came to a Sandy place near a Hill, some∣what
<PB N="36" REF="30"/>
higher than that they lay upon the night before. That having got to the top of it, from whence they had a very large pro∣spect round about, they could discover no∣thing but a large Heath, and at great di∣stance towards the South, a long Row of very high Mountains, which stood like a Wall, and reached from East to West as far as they could see. That after this discovery, they, being afraid of wanting Victuals, were returned to the Camp on the third day ac∣cording to my Command.</P>
<P>I found by these relations that I had had far better luck than these two Captains, and we were all the more encouraged to go to the new Camp on the Eastward; that we saw it had such conveniences as we could not find any where else, and that all our hopes lay on that side.</P>
<P>The next morning I called a Council, where I propounded our removal to the green Vale. It was embraced presently, and ordered that we should transport our People and Goods thither by degrees, beginning with those which were most necessary and easie to carry. The New Pinnace we were making was almost finished, and would be ready in four or five days more, and fit to transport our Guns, Casks, and other Lum∣ber.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="30"/>
In the mean while we used both our Boats to remove our Provisions, and sent many of our People by Land, with such Axes, Nails, Spades, and other Implements of that kind as we had there.</P>
<P>The Major went with the first Party, my Lieutenant with the second; and when I saw that most of our People and Goods were removed to the new Camp, and that the Pinnace was ready, I sent her loaded with diverse things, and travelled thither my self by Land.</P>
<P>I omitted to tell you that <HI>Maurice</HI> had doubled the Cape in his second Voyage with∣out any danger by reason of the calmness of the Sea, and the stilness of the weather, which was clear and serene, without any Rain or great Wind above six weeks after our Landing, and so temperate that we felt neither heat not cold in the first Month ex∣cept about noon, at which time the Sun was something hot; grew hotter every day as it drew nearer to us, and brought the Spring about <HI>August:</HI> For in those Countries it be∣gins then; contrary to our Parts, where the Summer ends at that time. <HI>Maurice</HI> told me, that at the head of the Cape he had found many small rocky Islands, which lay together very thick as far as a great one that
<PB N="38" REF="31"/>
lay at the very mouth of the Bay, and de∣fended it from the fury of the Waves; he was of opinion that it would prove an ex∣cellent Harbour for Ships, if the passage in∣to it was not too difficult, or too shallow for great Vessels by reason of the many Rocks that lay between the Cape and the great Island which divided and sheltered the Bay from the main Ocean.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Maurice,</HI> said I to him, when we have removed all our Goods and People, and they are settled in the new Camp, we shall have time enough to discover those Islands, and I will leave the discovery of them to your care and industry.</P>
<P>In less than twelve days after the first dis∣covery of the Vale we had transported all our People and Goods from the old Camp to the new, which in my absence <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> and other Officers named <HI>Sidenberge.</HI> That name obtained so in two or three days time that it was impossible afterwards to change it. Our men, partly by my order, or of their own accords, made several good Huts along the Brook side upon a piece of Ground al∣most a Mile long, which abutted to the Bay on the East side of the Cape. Wood we had plenty enough upon the place, and our Fi∣shermen took so much Fish in the Bay that
<PB N="39" REF="31"/>
we knew not what to do with it for want of salt to season or smoak it. But <HI>Maurice</HI> quick∣ly supplied us with that, for being gone up∣on some of those Rocks which lay at the mouth of the Bay, he found there as much of it as would serve the whole Company twenty years if we should be so long in that place</P>
<P>That Salt was naturally made by the wa∣ter of the Sea, which in great storms being slung upon those Rocks, filled some hollow places in them, where the heat of the Sun did afterwards turn it into Salt. There were every day great Parties sent into the Woods to discover and hunt the Deer, of which many Herds were found up and down, and many of them killed by our men. We saw every day multitudes of Water-fowl fly over the Bay, which made us judge that they had some particular haunt there. <HI>Maurice</HI> with his new Pinnace and his Longboat ventured every day further and further into the Bay, and in the Islands, and made seve∣ral good discoveries. He found a place near the great Island where grew abundance of Reeds and Rushes, and thither it was that an infinite number of Sea-fowl of al sorts did repair. He found another place where there came many green Turtles to lay their Eggs
<PB N="40" REF="32"/>
upon the Sand, from whence we might draw the greatest part of our subsistance. In fine, we found so many things to shift withal that we were certain never to want Victuals if we should live there a thousand years. The greatest want we were sensible of was that of Powder, for though we had saved a good quantity of it, yet that was a thing that would be consumed every day, and that we did not know how to get again when our stock was spent. We foresaw likewise that our Cloaths, Hooks, and Vessels would in a short time be worn out if our friends, that were gone in the Pinnace for <HI>Batavia,</HI> should be lost, and no relief sent us. But we had already so many experiments of Gods mercy towards us, that we hoped he would not for∣sake us.</P>
<P>The Spring came on apace, and we laid up every day new Victuals, by the means of which we saved the Ships Provision as much as we could, and chiefly some Casks of Pease, and other kind of Pulse we had brought from <HI>Europe.</HI> It came in my head to sow some of these in the ground, and having told some of my Officers of my design, they all readily agreed to it. In order to it, we felled a great many Trees above and below the Camp, and having cleared the ground of
<PB N="41" REF="32"/>
all bushes and underwood, which we burned upon the place, we made several furrows in the ground, and sowed our Pease in them, covered them carefully with the earth we had taken up, recommending our endeavours to him that gives the in∣crease.</P>
<P>Some of our Huntsmen venturing far in the Wood killed abundance of Game, and not being able to carry it all with them, they hanged two Deer upon an old and thick Tree with an intent to fetch them home the next day. But when seven of them came to the place the day following, they saw upon the Tree a great Tiger gnawing on the dead Deer before that terrible Creature percei∣ved our men, which I suppose was occasion∣ed through his hunger, which made him so eager about his meat that he minded nothing else. Our People were much surprised at the sight, and stood still behind some Trees, and two of them, having cocked their Guns, well charged with Bullets, they aimed, and shot a him both at one time, and fetched him down the Tree. The Tiger made a hi∣deous Cry when he fell, but being shot in two places through the body he died imme∣diately; they stripped him of his spotted skin, and taking down the dead Deer brought
<PB N="42" REF="33"/>
them in triumph into the Camp. I was glad of their success, but yet new fears came up∣on me upon that subject; for I judged, that since they had found this mighty Creature in the Forrest, there might be a great many more in it, which at some time or other might come to our Camp, and fall upon our People unawares.</P>
<P>I suggested this to the Council, and it was resolved, That without any delay we should make a strong Pallizado about our Hutts. We fell to work the next morning, and in less than ten days after we had empa∣led our Camp on all sides, so as to be secure from any sudden invasion of Men or Beasts. Our Huntsmen also became a little more cau∣tious than before, and did not dare to straggle in the Woods least they should meet any of those dreadful Creatures.</P>
<P>It was now seven weeks since we were cast away, and hitherto we had had no strife nor quarrel among us so long as we lay in fear and danger: But as soon as we thought our selves secure from men, beasts, thirst, and hunger, when we fed plentifully upon fresh meat and Fish, and we did not labour so much as before, then our People be∣gan to be wanton. We had a great many Women among us, of which I hitherto for∣bore
<PB N="43" REF="33"/>
to speak, because I saw no great occa∣sion for it. But now that they began to act their part, and stir up trouble among us, I must a little speak of them.</P>
<P>Some of them were poor women, who compelled by Poverty, and their hopes of Preferment, were perswaded to go to the <HI>Indies.</HI> Some had their Husbands there, or other Relations, but most of them were Whores taken out of Bawdy houses, or spi∣rited away by Fellows, who sold them to the Master for a little money, notwithstanding the punishment ordained by the Laws against such practices. These Whores seeing themselves at rest, and the men idle for the most part, began to smile at them, and by amorous speeches to draw some of them to themselves; they found many so well dis∣posed that they needed no spur to be put on, so they would sometimes come together in the night, and enjoy one another in the best manner they could. But as we lay altogether in a little Camp, and that there was a Guard kept in the night, they could not meet so secretly but some body or other would disco∣ver them and become a sharer in the prey. These practices did often occasion quarrels, and jealousies, which at last came to blows, but chiefly upon this particular occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="34"/>
Two young Fellows lay both with one woman, and did not know one of the other; once she appointed a meeting to one of them in the night, and the other coming to her a while after, and requesting the like favour that very night, she denied him, and put him off upon frivolous pretences. The Fel∣low being subtil, and of a jealous disposi∣tion, suspected something of the truth, and resolved so narrowly to watch her that he would find the true reason of her denial; he did it accordingly, and caught the Wench with her other Gallant in the fact, the sight whereof did so move his anger, that he drew his Sword and stuck them both in the ground, and then slunk away without being seen.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Couple cried out, and were found in that posture, first, by the next Sentinel, and then by the whole Guard, who having taken the Sword out of their bodies, and out of the ground, into which it was run above a foot (such was the strength and rage of this jealous Lover) carried them to the Chirurgeon, who presently dressed their wounds, then came to me to give me an account of the business.</P>
<P>The next day I assembled the Council to advise what should be done about this horrid
<PB N="45" REF="34"/>
fact, but we knew not whom to accuse. We examined every body that could be suspected; we asked the wounded man, Whether he had any enemies which he could himself suspect? He answered, That as he had neither wronged nor disobliged any body of the Company, so he could not fasten any suspition upon any man. We examined the Wench, but she would accuse no body, although she suspected, and it may be knew the Author of the Crime; but knowing that it was a just indignation and excess of Love that had moved her other Lover to take that revenge, she was so ge∣nerous as not to accuse or mention him in the least.</P>
<P>This put us into a great perplexity, and we did not know by what ways or means we should find out the Criminal, when at last it came into our thoughts to draw out our men into the Fields, and see which of them wanted his Sword, for no body would own that which had been found in the un∣happy Couples bodies. When they were all drawn up, we called every one of them ac∣cording to the order of the List, and found out the Fellow by the want of his Sword. He was immediately apprehended, and brought to his trial. We asked him, What
<PB N="46" REF="35"/>
was the reason he was come into the field without his Sword? To which he answered boldly, He came without because he had none. Had you never any in this Camp, said I to him? Yes Sir, I had one Yesterday. What have you done with it? I lent it last night to one who was to go to Sea this morn∣ing (for it was true, that a Party of <HI>Maurice</HI> his men were gone early in the morning to some of the Islands.) Then we asked him, What the mans name was he lent his Sword to? I do not know his name, said he, although I lent him my Sword, and did sometimes converse with him, as I do in∣differently with any one in this Camp, where I know every one by his face, although I am ignorant of the names of most men in the Company, and I do think that it is the case of every man here as well as mine. Then I asked him, Whether he was a Seaman or a Passenger he lent his Sword to? He was a Seaman, and told me, he had lost his own Sword when he borrowed mine; and be∣cause he would not have it known that he had lost his Weapon, he intreated me to let him have mine upon his urgent occasian. Then did we send for the Sword with which the fact had been committed, and asked him, Whether he knew that Sword?
<PB N="47" REF="35"/>
He readily answered, He might very well know it, since he had wore it ever since I trained up all the men of the Camp into a Military Discipline, whereof himself was one. Sir, saith he, This is my Sword, and the very same I lent last night to him that borrowed it of me. How came this Sword to be found in the bodies of the two wounded persons if your hands did not thrust it through them?</P>
<P>And please you General, it doth not fol∣low that I thrust it into their bodies because it is my Sword, he that had it of me might use it to commit that cruelty instead of using his own, thereby to shake off all suspition from himself, and lay the guilt on me. I confess that there are many apparent Argu∣ments against my Innocency, but I am sure there is no evident proof, and I hope you will never find any. After this strict exami∣nation, finding we could not convince this Fellow till <HI>Maurices</HI> Crew were come from Sea, we deferred his trial until another time.</P>
<P>But it fell out by fortune that the men of the Boat being upon one of the Sandy Islands where they turn Tortoises, and some of them having a mind to swim, went into the Sea to wash and cool themselves in
<PB N="48" REF="36"/>
that Element; and as some were more for∣ward than others, a great Shark snapped the forwardest of the Company, who being warned by that dreadful example, got out of the water with all the hast possible. The Story of this fatal accident, as likewise the de∣scription of the person who had been devou∣red, came to the knowledge of the Prisoner we had examined, before we could bring him to a second trial. When he was tried again, he cunningly catching hold on the opportunity, said confidently, That he had lent his Sword to him who was devoured, of whose Face and Person he made a very exact description in our presence. So that we could not do any good, nor bring any evi∣dent proof against him. We all admired his confidence and subtilty, and hearing that the wounded persons were like to be well again, we were contented to keep him in bonds till they were both out of danger. The woman was soonest well, and here you may admire the humour of some of that Sex. As soon as she was cured she came to the young man who had wounded her, and expressed the greatest love to him that can be imagined, under pretence that she had been the cause of all his trouble. But I think the true rea∣son was, that she looked upon this Fellow
<PB N="49" REF="36"/>
as a man well in his body, having never been wounded, and who consequently was far more vigorous than her other Gallant, who had lately received a large wound through the body.</P>
<P>This accident occasioned new Laws, and new Customs. We considered, that as long as we had Women among us they would be the occasion of trouble and mischief if we did not betimes take some good course, and allow our men the liberty of using them sometimes in an orderly manner. But we had but seventy four women, and above three hundred men, and therefore could not give every man a Wife. We consulted long upon a Method, and at last pitched up∣on this, We allowed the principal Officers each of them one woman wholly for him∣self, with the priviledge of chusing accord∣ing to his rank. The rest we distributed into several divisions, and ordered it so, that every man, who was not past fifty years of Age, might have his woman-bedfellow eve∣ry fifth night; we laid aside the old men, and the four Wives that were going to their Husbands in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and who professed to be very chaste and honest. These kept toge∣ther, and lived a while very reserved, but when they saw that all the other women lay
<PB N="50" REF="37"/>
freely every night with a man without in∣curring any blame, and that the relief we expected from <HI>Batavia</HI> was long a coming, they began to grow melancholy, and to re∣pent that they had chosen chastity for their share, by which means they were deprived alone of those delights and pleasures which they saw all the other women take so freely and so plentifully. They shewed their dis∣contented minds by a hundred actions, and they nor we were never quiet till we had di∣stributed them among the rest, and then they were satisfied. Here we had a very great proof that multiplicity of men to one woman is no friend to Generation, for few of these women, who were common to five men, proved with Child; and on the con∣trary, all those who lay but with one man presently got a great belly. I think that is the natural reason why multiplicity of Husbands was never allowed in any Nation, although Poligamy of Wives and Concubines was ever used, and is still practised in most Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>Now the time was come that we were to set up the Signal we agreed upon with the eight men of the first Pinnace sent to <HI>Bata∣via.</HI> I therefore commanded our men to chuse in the Forrest a tall and streight tree to
<PB N="51" REF="37"/>
set it up at the head of the Cape with a white Sail the largest we had, which was done accordingly. I commanded also a great fire to be made every night at the same place, that the Ships sent to our relief might see it in the dark, and take their aim by that. We were in good hopes that the Pinnace was got to <HI>Batavia</HI> without any great difficulty, considering the good weather we had had, and that the General would send us relief with all the diligence possible. But God it seems had ordered it otherwise, for the wea∣ther, which for almost two months had been fair, began to grow rainy, and stormy, so that we saw almost every day great tem∣pests in the Ocean, although our Bay was not much agitated by them by reason of the high ground, and the many little Islands that sheltered it from the violence of the Winds and Waves. It rained almost every day for a fortnight together, but the Sun shined hot every day also, so that we had a mixture of Rain, Wind, and Sunshine at the same time. It was well that we had been provident in powdring and smoaking of meat and fish, which we laid up in great store in the empty Casks we had brought from our Ships, for if we had not done so, we might have wanted Victuals while this
<PB N="52" REF="38"/>
bad weather lasted, which was above a fort∣night. It grew a little better after that space of time, but not so good but we had Winds, Rains, and Storms at Sea; then sudden calms, at the least once or twice a week, which made us despair of ever hearing from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and made us resolve to provide for our selves there, without depending upon any relief from thence.</P>
<P>The weather grew very hot, and since the rain fell all things were visibly grown in the fields, and our Pease did thrive the best that ever I saw, so we were like to have a great Crop of them, which encouraged, us to break more ground, and to sow a great ma∣ny more. There was an infinite of Fish and Fowl in the Bay, and upon a calm day we could take as many of them as we pleased; but our Nets began to wear out, and we were forced to tear some of our Cables to make new Nets of them, which we made a shift with for a great while, necessity being the mother of Arts.</P>
<P>Our Huntsmen had made such a noise in the Wood near the Camp, and so chased the Dear, that they were quite gone from that part, and none could be seen ten miles about us. That made them resolve to take another course, and to go by water to the other side
<PB N="53" REF="38"/>
of the Bay, or to the bottom of it, where we saw Wood all round. <HI>Maurice</HI> was first ordered to make discoveries on the other side; which he did, and found there were great Woods there, and a little River that ran into the Bay. He rowed four or five miles up that River and saw nothing but Trees, and some marshy ground along the bank of it, yet we supposed there would be many Deer found on that side if we should put it to a trial. In order to which, fifty of our men having taken Victuals and Ammu∣nition for a Week, went to the Banks of that River in the Pinnace, and the Long∣boat, and having Landed there, made them∣selves Huts, keeping the Long-boat with them to use it according to their occasion, and sending the Pinnace back again. A while after being gone into the Forrest to seek for Deer, they found great Herds of them, whereof they made a great slaughter; they likewise found a kind of Beast like a Swine, but bigger, and slower in his pace, and using to go a rooting in the Woods in great num∣bers; they killed first one of them, vvhich upon examination proved far better meat than any of our European Pork.</P>
<P><HI>Maurice</HI> being desirous to discover the great Island that lay at the mouth of the
<PB N="54" REF="39"/>
Bay, landed there with twenty men; the first part of it that lay inwardly he found to be but Stony and Rocky places, but when they were gone a little beyond, they found it to be a pretty big Island, consisting for the most part of moorish ground, which being almost dreined by the heat of the Summer was turned into very good Pasture ground; they found hundreds of Deer feeding upon it, and abundance of Fowl of all kind, so tame that they would let a man come within a yard or two of them, they marched to the East∣ward of the place, and found that this Land was divided from the continent by a narrow Channel only; it was found afterward that in the Spring time the Deer swam from the Continent to the Island, which Island was not above twelve miles Diameter. These new discoveries being so happy filled our hearts with joy, and a certain assurance we should not want for Victuals if we were ten times as many, and made us bold to venture farther.</P>
<P><HI>Maurice</HI> had observed that the Bay ran a great way in length towards the Southeast, and supposed there was some great River that flowed from that side of the Country into the Sea, which was not unlikely. He therefore, having obtained leave to take a
<PB N="55" REF="39"/>
Weeks Provision, and a sufficient number of men, sailed that way with a resolution to go as far as he could with his Pinnace, and we having prayed for his good success minded our other concerns, in hopes of his happy return.</P>
<P>By this time our Pease were almost ripe, and nine or ten days after we had a most prodigious Crop of them, every Peck yield∣ing above a hundred, which is almost incre∣dible; and we expected another Crop that promised no less than this if it should come to perfection. We dried them carefully, and laid them up in store for the Winter and so we did with every thing that would keep, using for the present such as could not be pre∣served.</P>
<P>It was above a quarter of a year since we were setled at <HI>Sidenberg,</HI> and having heard nothing from <HI>Batavia,</HI> we concluded our Pinnace was perished, and gave it over for lost; but our greatest trouble was, that above ten days were past since <HI>Maurice</HI> was gone and we heard no tidings of him: This cast a general sorrow upon our hearts, and in that great affliction we did not know what Counsel to take, we durst not send the Long∣boat in search of him for fear she should be lost, knowing that without our Vessels
<PB N="56" REF="40"/>
we could hardly be able to subsist.</P>
<P>Our Huntsmen had made a kind of a new Plantation on the other side of the Bay for conveniency of hunting, and without our Boats we could keep no commerce with them. All these reflections, and the fear of worse accidents increased our affliction throughout all the Camp, where we lay la∣menting the loss of our Pinnaces above a fortnight before we could hear any thing of either of them. <HI>Maurice</HI> did not come, and we did not know what to think of him and his Vessel, knowing there had been no great storms since she was gone, and that being in so calm a Sea she could not have perished by Tempests. We did not think neither that she was fallen into the hands of Enemies or Pyrates, having reason to believe from our former experience that there were no men in those parts.</P>
<P>Wavering so betwixt hope and fears, up∣on a calm day we saw <HI>Maurices</HI> Pinnace and two Vessels more coming along with him towards us. While we were looking upon them, wondring how he came by these two Vessels, and what they might be, We spied ten Sails more at a good distance coming af∣ter them. This unexpected Fleet put our Camp into a great apprehension. We ran
<PB N="57" REF="40"/>
all to our Arms, prepared our Cannons for our defence, and sent Scouts towards the shore to observe the motions of this Fleet. In the mean while they drew near to the shore, and at Musket shot they all cast An∣chor in good order; but <HI>Maurices</HI> Pinnace came very near, so that we could see him and his men from the shore, and hear him plainly speak to us. He bid us not be afraid, and desired us to send the Boat with three men only to fetch him ashore; after some contestation we sent the Boat, which being come aboard him he leapt into it with one of his men, and took down with him a tall and grave Personage in a black Gown, a Hat on his head, and a white Flag in his hand, and so came ashore to us.</P>
<P>I, with some of my Officers, stood at some distance, but when we saw this man landed we went to meet him. <HI>Maurice</HI> told us in few words, That he was sent from the Governour of a City situate about sixty miles above the Bay, where we had received all the kindness and civility imaginable, and desired us withal to express all manner of respect to him. Upon that advice we did bow to him in very humble and submissive manner, which he received with a great deal of gravity and mildness, and stretching
<PB N="58" REF="41"/>
his right hand towards Heaven, said in very good Dutch.</P>
<Q>The Eternal God of the World bless you, the Sun his great Minister, and our glorious King, shine kindly upon you, and this our Land be fortunate to you.</Q>
<P>After this, <HI>Maurice</HI> having told him that I was the General, he gave me his hand, which I humbly kist, and he took me about the neck and kissed me in the middle of the forehead, and then desired to march to our Camp, where we received him in the best manner we could. He looked upon our Huts and Pallizadoes, and nodded his head in sign that he liked it very well; then spake thus to me:</P>
<Q><HI>Sir, I have heard the History of your dis∣aster, and knowing of your merits and Gallan∣try, I have made no difficulty of putting my Person into your hands; but that I may not keep you any longer from the Relation your Officer</HI> Maurice <HI>will make unto you of what hath hapned unto him since his departure from hence; I desire to rest a little in your Hut while you sa∣tisfie your curiosity, and hear those things which will be necessary for you to be acquainted with, and that I hope will set your minds at rest.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="59" REF="41"/>
We made no answer, but making a low reverence left him in the Hut, and went to <HI>Maurice,</HI> who expected our coming in <HI>Van de Nuits</HI> Hut. We were no sooner with him but we began to ask him questions concern∣ing his journey; and he having begged our leave and favourable audience spake to us in this manner:</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>Maurices Speech.</HEAD>
<P><Q>NOble General, and worthy Officers, with your leave, and even with your Command, I departed from this place about three Weeks ago, with a design to make further discoveries in the Bay. The first day I sailed to the Southeast of it above twenty miles, and saw nothing on either side but great Woods as you see here, distant one from another five or six miles at the least. At night we cast Anchor at a mile distance from the right side of the river, and lay there till next morning. From thence with Wind and Tide we sailed up further to the Southeast about five Miles more, and there we found the Banks on each side of the River came near one to another, within two miles distance. We sailed up
<PB N="60" REF="42"/>
still, though with a little more difficulty, till we came into abroad place, where the water spreads it self into a great Lake, from the middle of which we could hard∣ly see the shore on either side; we only saw ten or twelve small Islands dispersed up and down the Lake, and most of them shaded with tall green trees, very delight∣ful to the Eyes. By this time the Wind was somewhat altered, and the Lake was so calm that we could hardly perceive any motion in it; but as the place was wide we rid to and fro as the Wind did serve, not much caring which side of the Lake we should go first to, yet when the Wind would serve we endeavoured as much as we could to make to the Southeast. About Evening we had a fine breeze, which drove us to the Southeast according to our wishes, and that night we cast Anchor be∣twixt two or three of those small Islands, not above two or three miles distant one from the other, with an intent to visit them the day following. We lay at Anchor all night, and took our rest without any care or fear, not thinking there had been any In∣habitants in those places, but we found we were much deceived, for as soon as it was broad light we saw about us ten or twelve
<PB N="61" REF="42"/>
Vessels, which did so encompass us about, that we could go no way but we must fall among them. This struck a great terrour upon us, and we thought verily vve should all be killed or taken, for vve had but one of these vvays to chuse, to fight, or to surrender our selves, and lie at the mercy of unknovvn men, vvho might use any cruelty upon us. This last considerati∣on prevailed, and made us all resolve to fight it out to the last man; so vve all ran to our Arms, prepared our Guns, and vvere very vvell resolved to defend our lives, for vve could not run avvay, the vveather being very still, and the men vve savv about us having several Shallops vvell manned vvith Rovvers, vvho rovved to∣vvards us vvith great svviftness. When they vvere come vvithin Musket shot of us they all stopped, save a small Vessel, vvherein vve savv a man vvith a vvhite Flag in his hand coming on to us, and making many signs in token of Amity. We stood to our Arms, and let that Ves∣sel come on to us, knovving it vvas not strong enough alone to attempt any thing against our Pinnace. When they vvere come vvithin fifteen or tvventy yards of us the man vvho had the vvhite Flag in his
<PB N="62" REF="43"/>
hand, making a low reverence, spake to us in Spanish, and bad us not be afraid, for no harm was intended against us. One of my men, who could speak that Language, explained what he said, and asked him why they came so about us? He answered, It was the custom of the place, that we should come to no harm, and desired to know what Countrimen we were. He told him we were <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Then he replied in Dutch, That we were welcome into the Country, and desired to be admitted into our Pinnace himself and another man of his Company only, prof∣fering to remain with us as Hostages till matters were better understood. We rea∣dily yielded unto his desire, so they came aboard us. He was a very lusty man, with a manly look, wearing a red Gown down to the middle of his Legs, with a Cap of the same colour, and a Shash about his waste, much after the Garb we paint Car∣dinals in. The other man was in the like habit, and a lusty man too, both about forty years of Age. When he was come up to us he asked who was the Commander of the Pinnace; and having been told I was the Person, he came to me in a kind and civil manner embraced me, and bid us
<PB N="63" REF="43"/>
all welcome into the Country. Then he asked how we came into those parts in so small a Vessel. I answered, That we came in a bigger, but that she was cast away up∣on the Coasts, and that out of her Ruines we had made this Pinnace. Then he asked me if we were all that were saved? I told him it was so, and that the rest of our Com∣pany were drowned (for I did not think it fit to speak of our People in the Camp un∣til we were better acquainted with these men, and saw what usage we should have amongst them.) He altering his Counte∣nance, as if he had been sorry for our loss, told us he took great part in our affliction. Then did he ask me several questions con∣cerning our Voyage, our Shipwrack, and the present state of <HI>Europe.</HI> To which I returned such answers as I thought conve∣nient. He seemed to be well pleased with my answers, and told us we were come in∣to a Country where we should find more kindness and civility than we could in our own, and where we should want none of those things that are capable to make mode∣rate men happy. We returned him humble thanks, and desired to know what the name of the Country was? He told us it was called in their Language <HI>Sporumbè,</HI> the
<PB N="64" REF="44"/>
Inhabitants <HI>Sporui;</HI> that it belonged to a greater and happier Country beyond the Hills, called <HI>Sevarambè,</HI> and the people <HI>evarambi,</HI> who lived in a great City called <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> That we were not above four∣teen Miles from another City (but much less than the first) called <HI>Sporunde</HI> where he intended to carry us. Then perceiving some alteration in our faces caused by his last words, he proceeded in this manner:</Q></P>
<P><Q>Gentlemen, I told you at first you should not be afraid, for no harm will be done you I assure you, unless you will draw it upon your selves through your distrust and stubbornness. Your best way is to rely upon Gods Providence, and the assurances I give you, that no wrong shall be done to the least of you either in his person or his goods. You are but a small number of men in a little Pinnace, in a strange Country, destitute of all things, and no way able to defend your selves against our Vessels which are many against one, and full of men, who no less understand how to fight than you, as you will find if you put it to a trial. They are no Barbarians as you may ima∣gine, but a very good charitable and civil people. So consider what is best for you to do. As soon as he had spoken those words,
<PB N="65" REF="44"/>
he and his Companion went to one end of the Pinnace as it were to give us an oppor∣tunity to consult among our selves, which we did, and presently resolved to follow his directions, and to trust to Providence. He, perceiving we intended to go to him, came himself to us, and asked what course we were resolved to take? We intend to obey your Commands in every thing, Sir, and think our selves happy to be under your protection; We are poor distressed men, fitter Objects for pity than for anger, and we hope to find Mercy and help at your hands. You will find it in a great measure, and see in these Countries such wonders as are not to be seen in any other part of the World. Then he made sign to his Shallop to come near, which they did immediately. They brought us Bread, Wine, dry Dates, Raisins, Figs, and several sorts of Nuts, of which we made an excellent Feast, and drank merrily of the delicate Wines that were given us. After this welcom Meal, the man told me his name was <HI>Carshidà,</HI> his Companion's <HI>Benoscar,</HI> and desired to know mine. I told him my name was <HI>Maurice,</HI> and asked him withal how he came to speak <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> in so re∣mote a Country. I will satisfie you herein
<PB N="66" REF="45"/>
another time <HI>Maurice,</HI> (said he) in the mean while we must give order for our go∣ing to <HI>Sporundè,</HI> that we may be there to day before night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then did he speak to his men in his own Language, and they made sign to another Vessel that stood near to come to us, they presently came, and having tied a rope to our Pinnace, towed her up the Lake to the Southeast of it, the other Vessel rowing af∣ter us; in that manner we left the little Island and the Fleet (which did not stir from their Station so long as we were in sight of them) and rowed till two in the afternoon through that great Lake of salt water, which looks more like a Sea than like a Lake. About that time we had a gen∣tle breeze, which carried us in less than two hours clear out of the Lake into a River, where we found sweet water, and saw a fine Champain Country on each side of it. We had not sailed two miles in this River but we came to a pretty narrow place, where the water is kept in by two great and thick Walls, and saw all along near these Walls great Buildings of Brick and Stone mixed together, and built after the manner of a Castle in a perfect Quadrangle. We went two miles further up along these Walls
<PB N="67" REF="45"/>
and Buildings before we came to the Ci∣ty of <HI>Sporundè,</HI> which stands in the con∣fluence of two great Rivers, in a fine de∣licate Plain, diversified with Corn-fields, Meadows, Orchards, Gardens, and Groves, which make it very delightful to the eye; the small Vessel, which at first came after us, was gone up a good while before we came to the Town, to give them warning of our coming. We rowed up to a great and stately Key, where stood a great mul∣titude of People, who came out to see us Land. <HI>Carshidà</HI> went on shore first, where he was received by some grave men in black, with whom having discoursed a while, he turned himself towards us, and made signs to <HI>Benoscar</HI> to bring us ashore. He in a few vvords told us vvhat vve vvere to do, and bid us to follovv him. We vvent up the Stairs of the Key, (vvhich vvas pretty high) and being come to the place vvhere the grave men stood, vve inclined our selves down to the ground three several times. The men bowed a little to us, and the chiefest of them taking me in his Arms, very kindly embraced me, kissed me in the fore∣head, and bade us all vvelcom to <HI>Sporundè.</HI> From that place they carried us through a stately Gate, and a noble Street as streight
<PB N="68" REF="46"/>
as a Line, to a great square building after the manner abovesaid. We vvent into it through a large gate that stood in the mid∣dle of the Building, and found the inner part of it to be like Cloysters vvith large Galleries on all sides, and a large Green in the middle. From thence vve vvere brought into a great Hall, vvhere stood several Ta∣bles and Seats. There the grave men in black stood round me, and asked me seve∣ral questions, much like unto those <HI>Carshidà</HI> had asked me at the first, to vvhich I an∣svvered in the same manner. A vvhile after they carried us to another Hall next unto that, vvhere vve found several Tables full of meat, much after our <HI>European</HI> fashion. Then <HI>Sermodas</HI> (for that is the name of the grave man vvho is novv in the Generals Hut) asked me vvhether vve had any sto∣mach to our Supper. To vvhom I made ansvver, That it vvas so long since we had seen such a Supper that I did not think any of us vvould vvant a stomach to eat it. He smiled, and taking me by the hand brought me to the chiefest Table, and made me sit next to him; then all the other grave men sate vvith us, and <HI>Carshidà</HI> with <HI>Be∣noscar</HI> took all my men to another Table. We had a very noble Supper, after vvhich
<PB N="69" REF="46"/>
we were carried up into a great Room, where we saw several Beds upon Iron Bed∣steads. There my men were ordered to lye two and two, and I was carried to a Room by my self, where <HI>Sermodas</HI> and his com∣pany wished me good night, and so went away. A while after <HI>Carshidà</HI> came in and told me, that I and my men must prepare to appear the next day before <HI>Albicormas,</HI> Governour of <HI>Sporundè,</HI> and said he would give us directions how to behave our selves, and so he bid me good night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The next day about six of the clock in the morning we heard a great Bell ring, and an hour after <HI>Carshidà</HI> and <HI>Benoscar</HI> came into my Chamber, and asked me how I had taken my rest, and if I wanted any thing? I would have risen presently, but he told me I must not, till such time as I had new Cloaths to put on, which would be brought immediately. Upon that <HI>Be∣noscar</HI> went out, and came a while after with some attendance, who brought new Cloaths, both Linnen and Woollen, made after the manner of the Country. Then came in others with a Tub, which they filled with warm water, and then <HI>Carshidà</HI> told me it was to wash my body in before I put on my new Cloaths, and so went out
<PB N="70" REF="47"/>
with all the Company, leaving only a Ser∣vant to wait upon me. According to his directions I vvashed, and then put on a fine Cotten Shirt and Dravvers, vvith Stockings of the same. I had also a nevv black Hat, nevv Shooes, a Govvn of seve∣ral colours, and a black Shash to put about my middle. As soon as I vvas ready, the Servant, taking my old Cloaths vvith him, vvent out, and then came in again <HI>Carshidà</HI> and his company, vvho told me that I and all my men vvere to attend <HI>Albicormas</HI> and his Council, and gave me directions hovv to behave my self. We vvent dovvn into the Yard, vvhere I found all my men in nevv Apparel, much like unto mine, but not altogether so good, and vvearing Caps on their heads instead of Hats. <HI>Benoscar</HI> vvas vvith them, and vvas giving them directions hovv to behave themselves be∣fore the Council. We stood there a vvhile looking one upon another, till <HI>Sermodas</HI> and his company came in. He very kindly asked us all hovv vve did, and then, di∣recting his speech to me, he asked me vvhe∣ther I vvas ready to vvait upon the Coun∣cil? I ansvvered vve vvere all ready to obey his Commands; vvhich said, he took me by the hand, and made me march on his
<PB N="71" REF="47"/>
left side into the Street. <HI>Carshidà</HI> put him∣self at the head of my men, vvhich vvere disposed tvvo and tvvo, and marched in Rank and File like Souldiers, <HI>Benoscar</HI> bringing up the Rear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In that order vve marched through some Streets till we came to a great place in the middle of the City, and in the Center of this place stood a large and magnificent Palace, of a square Figure, and built with white Freestone, and black Marble, all so clean, and so well polished, that we thought it was new, though we heard after∣wards it had been built a good while. In the middle stood a great and stately Gate, adorned with several brazen Statues, and on each side thereof two long Files of Musquetteers, all in blew Gowns. We marched through them into the first Court, where we found another Lane of men in red Gowns, with Halberts in their hands. As soon as we were come in, we heard a great sound of many Trumpets, and several other Instruments of War, very sweet and pleasant, which sounded all the time we stood in that Yard, for a quarter of an hour. From thence we proceeded into the next Court, all built with well polished black Marble, with Nitches round about,
<PB N="72" REF="48"/>
and delicate Statues in them. In the middle of the Yard stood about a hundred men in black, most of them of riper years than those we had seen in the other Courts. We stood a little in that place, till two grave men (such as stood in the Court, with on∣ly this difference, that they wore a piece of Gold coloured Silk hanging loose upon their left shoulder) came down and bid <HI>Sermodas</HI> bring us all up. We went up in the same order as we came, upon a stately Stair-case, gilt and painted very richly, to a great Hall, gilt and painted in the same manner, and there we stood a while. From that they brought us into another Hall, richer than the first; and then into a third, far beyond either of them. At the end of this Hall we saw a pretty high Throne, and a little lower long Seats on each side of it. Upon the Throne sate a grave Majestick Personage, and upon the other Seats several venerable men on his right and left. He that sate uppermost in the midst of them wore a Purple Gown, and the others were habited like the two men who led us into the place, who were Members of the Council. We were told that he in the Purple Gown was <HI>Albicormas,</HI> and the others the chiefest Officers of the City,
<PB N="73" REF="48"/>
who, together with him, govern the whole Country of <HI>Sporumbè.</HI> At our first com∣ing into the Hall we made an inclination of our bodies, then being come to the middle of it we bowed a little more, but when we came to a Balister or Rail near to the Throne, we bowed down to the very ground, according to the directions given us before. Then stood up all the Counsel∣lors and made a small inclination of their bodies, but <HI>Albicormas</HI> nodded only with his head. Then did <HI>Sermodas</HI> take me by the hand, and brought me as near the Rail as we could go, and bowing down very profoundly spake to <HI>Albicormas,</HI> and gave him partly an account of us in his own Language, as we imagined, and as we were told afterwards. Methoughts their Speech sounded much like the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latine,</HI> as I have sometimes heard it spoken in <HI>Holland,</HI> and ran very smooth and Majestical. When <HI>Sermodas</HI> had spoken a while, <HI>Carshida</HI> was sent for, who gave the Council a full rela∣tion of our Affairs, and of the time and manner we came into the Lake, by them called <HI>Sporascumpso;</HI> how we were seen and taken in it, which was in this manner, as we understood afterwards.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="49"/>
<Q>The day upon which we came into the Lake was a solemn day in those parts, so that all the Inhabitants of the Islands were celebrating the same, and intent upon their Exercises and Pastimes when we sailed into it, and that was the reason why we saw no Vessels in it at first, although there are several fishing there upon other days. But although we saw no body, yet our Pinnace was soon spied from the Islands, so that several Vessels were sent out in the night to catch us in the morning, and secure us from going back again without leave. It being the custom of those People to keep a very strict guard about their Country for fear it should come to be known to Fo∣reigners, whose designs, and corrupted lives might in time bring trouble to their State, and corruption to their manners, the peace and purity of which two things they are most careful to secure.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When <HI>Carshidà</HI> had made an end of speaking. <HI>Albicormas</HI> stood up and bid us welcom in his own Language, as <HI>Sermodas</HI> interpreted it unto us. He added, That we should find all manner of kindness and good usage among the <HI>Sporui,</HI> and that we should stay in <HI>Sporundè</HI> till such a time as he did receive Orders from <HI>Sevarminas,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="49"/>
the Suns Vice-Roy, who lived in the City of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> whither he would send a Messenger that very day to give him an account of us. That in the mean while we should enjoy all the comfort and mode∣rate pleasure the Country could afford if we would be ruled by <HI>Sermodas</HI> and his Officers, to whose care and conduct he recommend∣ed me and all my men, exhorting us to be∣have our selves modestly, and so he dismis∣sed us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I observed, that <HI>Albicormas</HI> was very crooked, though he was otherwise a man of good presence, and grave carriage, and so were many of his Assessors; and we found afterwards that among the People there was a great number of deformed persons mixed with very handsom Folk of all Ages and Sexes; and I was told, That the reason of it was, that those of <HI>Sevarindè</HI> sent all such imperfect People as were born amongst them to this place, and would not suffer any body who had any deformity of body to live in their Country. I was fur∣ther told, That in their Language <HI>Spora</HI> signified a defective person, and <HI>Sporundè</HI> the City of the maimed or defective. Those that were incorrigibly vitious, or unquiet, were disposed of another way, as in the
<PB N="76" REF="50"/>
sequel or continuation of this History shall hereafter be made appear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After <HI>Albicormas</HI> had dismissed us we went back to our Lodging in the same or∣der as we came from it, and found there a very good Dinner provided for us. We kept at home all that Afternoon because the weather was hot, but in the Evening <HI>Ser∣modas</HI> and <HI>Carshidà</HI> took us out to shew us the City, and led us from Street to Street, where we found great multitudes of Peo∣ple, who came out to look on us. The Town is the most regular that ever I saw, being divided into great square Buildings, which contain every one above a thousand People, &amp; they are built all after the same manner. There are seventy six of them, and so many thousands of Inhabitants in the whole City, which is above four miles about. It stands betwixt two Rivers, as I told you before, but the industry of that People has made it an Island of a Peninsula, by drawing a great Trench from River to river two miles above the City. This Trench is no less than three miles long, having a great Wall on each side and many Bridges over it, very broad and strongly built with large Free-stone, as you may see your selves when you come to the place.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="50"/>
<Q>At night we had a good Supper, and two hours after we were all carried to a great Hall, where we found fifteen young Wo∣men, who waited there for us. They were most of them very tall and proper women, in painted Callico Gowns, wearing their black hair in long and thick breads, hanging down upon their Breasts and Shoulders. We were a little surprised to find so many of them in a row, and did much admire at them, not knowing what they stood there for, when <HI>Sermodas</HI> spake to us in this manner:</Q></P>
<P><Q>You wonder <HI>Maurice</HI> to see here so many proper Women together, and little under∣stand the reason why you find them in this posture and habit, somewhat different from other womens Dress. Know you therefore that these are our slaves, and that they are here to wait upon you and your Com∣rades. You have your several Customs in <HI>Europe,</HI> and so have other Countries their own. Some are bad and vicious in nature, and others only seem to be good or bad ac∣cording to mens prejudices, and appre∣hensions. But there are some that are grounded upon Reason, and are truly good in themselves if we rightly consider them. Ours are for the most part, if not all of
<PB N="78" REF="51"/>
this kind, and we hardly have anyone which is not established upon Reason. You know, I suppose, that the moderate use of those good things Nature hath appointed for all living Creatures is good, and that there is nothing but the abuse of them, either in the excess, or in the defect that may be termed bad, provided Faith, Justice, and Equity be exactly observed</Q></P>
<P><Q>Among those good things, we conceive there are two of the greatest importance, <HI>viz.</HI> The preservation and happy being of every living Creature, and the propagation of its Species. The means to attain to the first are all those natural Actions, without which no Creature can subsist, and such are Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But her bountiful hands do not only give us those things which are meerly necessary to keep us alive, but also liberally bestow upon us those delights and pleasures, the just and moderate use whereof may make our lives sweet and comfortable; and that we may the better take pleasure in them she hath given us an Appetite, and a Palate capable to discern their various tastes and qualities according as they are sutable to our natures. For the preservation of every Species Nature hath likewise appointed
<PB N="79" REF="51"/>
that every Male should be united to a Fe∣male, that by their union their kind should be preserved, which is her chiefest end. And that they may be the more inclined to accomplish her noble design she hath given them a mutual love and desire of Conjun∣ction, and annexed a pleasure to the actual union of the two Sexes for the preservation of the Species, as a pleasure also in eating, and drinking to every Animal. These are the Eternal Laws of God in Nature, and these two ends, together with the pleasure we take in the means, through which we may attain to them, are not only lawful and necessary, but also laudible and com∣manded. Besides these two great con∣cerns there is a third one, which hath a general regard to Humane Society, and without which no Kingdom or Common∣wealth can well subsit, and that is obedi∣ence and submission to the Government. But every Government ought to be established as much upon Natural Reason as possibly can be, that every Member of that Society may freely enjoy his natural liberty, and the moderate use of all those good things which Nature hath appointed for the wel∣fare of Mankind. For if any Government make those good things had and unlawful,
<PB N="80" REF="52"/>
which in themselves are good and inno∣cent, we may conclude that such Govern∣ment is unjust, and contrary to the Eter∣nal Laws of God and Natural Reason. By these Arguments it appears, that those who have not in these three principal things a due regard to their own persons, their Po∣sterity and their Neighbours are cruel to themselves, rebellious to God, and un∣worthy to live in any humane Society.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Those considerations induced our great Lawgiver <HI>Sevarias</HI> (whose glorious name and love of his imcomparable vertues shall ever be sweet and precious to us) to fit his Government as near as he could to the Laws of Nature established upon Reason, carefully avoyding to forbid any thing that is naturally good in it self, and allowing the moderate use of them to all his Sub∣jects. Among the rest of his Laws there is one that commands Marriage to all men and women, as soon as they are come to an Age fit for Generation, which Law and Custom we inviolably observe in all our Dominions. But because many among us are sometimes obliged to travel and leave their Wives at home, we keep in all Cities a number of women Slaves appointed for their use, so that we do not only give every
<PB N="81" REF="52"/>
Traveller Meat, Drink, and Lodging, but also a Woman to lye with him as openly and lawfully as if she were his Wife. Ac∣cording to this laudable custom, and being willing to use you as well as any of our own Nation, we have appointed so many women as you are men to come and lie with you every other night so long as you remain here with us if you can find in your hearts to use this priviledge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You may easily imagine that these rea∣sons quickly prevailed, and that he needed not use any further arguments to perswade us to accept of the proffer. We gave him most humble thanks, told him his Reasons were very powerful, and the Custom of this Country much better than that of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> in our judgment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Well, saith he, use the priviledge if you please, find out a method to agree among your selves, and so I wish you good night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As soon as he was gone there came in two men, who spake to us in <HI>French,</HI> and bid us welcome to <HI>Sporunde;</HI> one of them told us, he was a Physician, and his Com∣panion a Chirurgeon. He desired us very earnestly to be sincere with him, and to tell him whether any of us had any venereal distemper upon him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="53"/>
<Q>Gentlemen, I am appointed to examine every one of you upon that score, and if any deny the truth it will turn to his da∣mage and shame; but if he confess it inge∣niously he will get love, esteem, and a spee∣dy cure.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Every one of the Company said he was free from any such thing; but notwith∣standing our saying so, the man would not be satisfied till he had seen and carefully ex∣amined every one of us apart in a Room next to the Hall we stood in. When he was satisfied he told us he was very glad to find us all sound and free from so nasty distem∣per, very common in the other Continents, but only known by fame in the Southern Lands. He told us likewise, he had lived in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> above six years, and seen most parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asta</HI> in the space of twelve years, and that from time to time there were men sent from <HI>Sporundè</HI> beyond the Seas upon the same account, by which means they had persons among them who knew all those Nations, and could speak their Languages. This Speech un∣riddled to me the mystery of <HI>Carshidà's</HI> speaking <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> the first time he came to us, and took us out of the amaze∣ment we were in, to hear so many <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="53"/>
Languages, and to see so many of our Fashions in so remote a Country, where we supposed there could be none but barbarous People, if any at all. We would have satisfied our curiosity by asking this man several questions if the earnest desire of going to bed had not prevailed with us, we therefore advised how to find a method to proceed in the choice of the Women. It was at last agreed, That I, and then my two Mates should chuse before any of the others, and then the Commonalty should cast Lots among themselves, which was done accordingly without any dispute or quarrelling, so every man chose his bed∣fellow. Then was I brought to my Cham∣ber where I lay the night before, and my men to another long Gallery, on each side of which stood little Chambers, divided one from another by thin partition-Walls made of white Plaister, not unlike the Cells of Nuns and Friers. Every Couple had one of these places, and lay there, till next day without any the least disturbance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The next morning we heard the sound of the Bell at the usual time, and <HI>Carshidà</HI> came to me to ask me how I did, and to tell me it was time to rise. My Bedfellow had leaped out of the Bed, and put on her
<PB N="84" REF="54"/>
Cloaths as soon as she had heard the Bell ring, and was but just gone out of my Cham∣ber when <HI>Carshidà</HI> came into it. He told me <HI>Benoscar</HI> was gone to my men to take them out of Captivity, (meaning out of their Bedfellows embraces, and out of their Cells) where they had been locked all night lest they should use the opportunity of per∣mutation, not allowed in those parts, lest some of the women proving with Child the Father should be uncertain. When I was drest I went to the Hall, where my men came in like manner, and our Guides carri∣ed us out to shew us the Work-houses in several Squares of the City, where we saw both men and women working very order∣ly, some in Weaving and Sowing, others Forging, Carving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But <HI>Carshidà</HI> told us, That the chiefest employment of the Nation consisted in Building and Tilling of the ground.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We lived there in that manner till the sixth day after our first coming to <HI>Sporundè,</HI> expecting the return of the Messenger <HI>Albicormas</HI> had sent to <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> He came at last with Orders to send us to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> who was very desirous to see us. When I heard we were to march to <HI>Sevarinde</HI> I was sorry I had concealed your being here in
<PB N="85" REF="54"/>
this Camp, chiefly after we had found so good usage amongst those People, and did hardly know how to mend the matter; but the reason I had at first to do so being a good and solid reason I thought it would be received, and that <HI>Albicormas</HI> would forgive us the lye we told him, through the care we had for your safety in a time when we much doubted of our own. I did ingenuously confess the whole matter to <HI>Sermodas,</HI> who immediately went to <HI>Albicormas</HI> and told him what I had con∣fessed to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thereupon we were ordered to continue in <HI>Sporundè</HI> till the return of another Mes∣senger, who was presently dispatched to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to acquaint him with the whole matter. He returned six days after his de∣parture, and brought new Orders from <HI>Se∣varindè</HI> to <HI>Albicormas,</HI> who in obedience to them, sent us with all this Fleet to fetch you and carry us all to the great City, where we must appear before the Soveraign Power that resides there, and where <HI>Sermodas</HI> tells me we shall yet be better used than we were at <HI>Sporundè.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Maurice</HI> made an end of his Speech, which filled us all both with joy and admi∣ration,
<PB N="86" REF="55"/>
and seemed not to hold any considera∣ble time, though it had been long, and might have proved tedious upon another subject. But the things he related were so full of wonder and novelty that we could have gi∣ven him a quiet and patient hearing if his discourse had taken up a whole days time.</P>
<P>We consulted a while what we had best to do, and resolved at last to submit to <HI>Sermodas</HI> in all things, to go whither he would carry us, and wholly to depend upon Gods Pro∣vidence and these peoples Humanity.</P>
<P>While <HI>Maurice</HI> was relating all these ad∣ventures to us. Some of his men, who burned with a desire to be talking of the same to their Friends in the Camp, got ashore, and began to discourse with our peo∣ple, who gathering together in a ring about them, were all amazed at their relations, and were acquainted with the news almost as soon as we, so we needed not repeat any thing to them to let them know how our Affairs stood. They were all willing to go to these fine places the Fellows had men∣tioned and described to them, and wished themselves there already. One thing only vexed us all, and this was it, We were still in some hopes that our first Pinnace might have got to <HI>Batavia,</HI> which if it had, we did
<PB N="87" REF="55"/>
not doubt but the General would send Ships to our relief as soon as he should be informed with our misfortune. Now if those Ships should come and not find us, they would conclude we were lost, and we should see our selves deprived of all hopes of ever hearing from our Friends, and of re∣turning to our Native Country. But <HI>Mau∣rice</HI> told us, That there was no reason to fear in either of these cases, considering that we were fallen into the hands of a Civilized Nation, who had Ships, and sent some of them from time to time beyond the Seas. And that it was probable we might get leave to go to the <HI>Indies</HI> if we did not like this new Country.</P>
<P>After we had ended these Consultations we went to my Hut, where we found <HI>Ser∣modas</HI> just got up from the Quilt where he had a while taken his rest. He smiled at us when we came in, and asked us how we liked the Description <HI>Maurice</HI> had made us of the People and City of <HI>Sporundè?</HI> We answe∣red, We could not but like and admire both of them, and wish our selves there if it was his pleasure to carry us thither. I came for that purpose, said he, and I am very glad to find you so well disposed to go; you will find our Cities far better places to live in
<PB N="88" REF="56"/>
than this Camp, although through your in∣dustry you have made it already a very fine Habitation.</P>
<P>We had several discourses upon that and other subjects; after which we asked him, Whether he would not be pleased to eat and drink of such Victuals as we were able to give him? I will, saith he, eat of your Vi∣ctuals upon condition you will accept of such as we have brought along with us. Then he desired <HI>Maurice</HI> to send for some of his men, and bid them bring some of the Ships Provision, which together with ours made up a very good Feast.</P>
<P>When the Dinner was ended <HI>Sermodas</HI> told us, That since we were willing to go with him, we should use all diligence to put our selves in readiness, and order the transportation of our Men and Goods as we should think fittest; That he thought it con∣venient the chiefest of us, and all our women should go aboard the same day, and he would leave some of his men ashore, who together with such of ours as we should appoint should take care to ship up all our things, and then come after us to <HI>Sporundè.</HI> Thereupon I told him we had another com∣pany on the other side of the Bay, and if it was his pleasure we should send <HI>Maurice</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="56"/>
with a Vessel or two to fetch them. You may do so, answered he, and I will order one of our Ships to go along with <HI>Maurice,</HI> and carry them from their Station directly to the City without coming back again to this Camp. Do you get such of your Officers as you like best to keep you company, and come along with me aboard my Ship, where you will find passing good accommodations.</P>
<P>I took only <HI>De Nuits</HI> and <HI>Turci</HI> my Secre∣tary with me, and appointed <HI>Devese</HI> and the other Captain to command in my absence, and see every thing transported with good order and diligence.</P>
<P><HI>Sermodas</HI> left <HI>Benoscar</HI> with <HI>Devese</HI> to be his Assistant and Conductor, and so we sailed toward <HI>Sporundè,</HI> where we landed the third day after our departure from <HI>Siden∣berge.</HI> We were received in almost the same manner as <HI>Maurice</HI> had been, with this only difference, that <HI>De Nuits</HI> and I had a great deal more respect, and better atten∣dance than he had had.</P>
<P><HI>Albicormas</HI> was very kind to us, and par∣ticularly to me. We had several long con∣versations concerning the present state of <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein I was far better able to give him satisfaction than any one of our Com∣pany. I found he was a man of very excel∣lent
<PB N="90" REF="57"/>
parts, learned in all solid Sciences, and very well acquainted with the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>La∣tine</HI> Tongues. We spake <HI>Latine</HI> in all our conversations; for although he understood some of our Vulgar Languages, yet he could speak none so readily and so eloquently as <HI>Latine.</HI> He told me many things concerning the Customs and Government of their Nati∣on, which I will faithfully set out when I come to describe the City, Laws, and Man∣ners of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI></P>
<P>The day after our coming to this Town all our People and Luggage arrived there, and nothing was left in the Camp but what they thought was not worth taking. They were all used as <HI>Maurices</HI> men, and had new and clean Cloaths given them every man and woman.</P>
<P>But there arose some difficulty concerning our Women, for as you may remember it was ordered in the Camp that one woman should serve five of our common men, and none but our Principal Officers were allowed to have one woman wholly every Officer to himself.</P>
<P><HI>Sermodas</HI> and his Companions were much displeased with this Plurality of men to one woman, and told us it was so beastly a thing as was not to be suffered, and rather than to endure it they would provide more women
<PB N="91" REF="57"/>
for our men to keep them from that filthy and worse than brutish practice. We excu∣sed our selves upon the necessity of our con∣dition, and told him he might order the matter as he thought best himself. Will you, saith he, heartily conform to our Laws and and Customs? We told him, We desired to do so, and thought it our best way. Well then, saith he, number out your men and women, and give me a List of them all; and let me know likewise, how many of your Women are with Child, and we will take care that you shall be supplied with eve∣ry thing you want in that particular accord∣ing to the manner of the Country. We gave him an exact account of every thing accord∣ing to his desire; and then he said, That if any one of us was willing to stick to any of the Women we had, who was not with Child, he might do it; Furthermore, we should agree of a method for every one how to chuse his Bedfellow, for there would be a number of Slaves allowed to supply the want of our Women. We consulted among us how to proceed in that matter, and it was agreed, That every Principal Officer, who had a woman wholly to himself, might keep her still if he pleased, or take a Slave of the Country, chusing according to his degree;
<PB N="92" REF="58"/>
and that the Commonalty should cast Lots as <HI>Maurice</HI> his men had done before. Some of these Officers stuck to their old Bedfel∣lows, but others had rather chuse a new one than to keep such as they were already wea∣ry of; the inferiour sort chose according to their Lot; and <HI>Maurices</HI> men not being al∣lowed to make a new choice must be content to keep those women they had chose at the first. The women who were with child by any Officer were commanded to stick to the Father of the Child, although he was al∣lowed a fresh woman besides; as for those of the Commonalty that had a great belly, they were obliged to stick to one of the five men who lay with them, and exhorted to chuse, as near as they could, the man whom they thought to be the true Father of the Child. And that was the Method according to which this matter was ordered, much to most of our Womens grief and discontent.</P>
<P>The fifth day after we were come to <HI>Spo∣rundè, Sermodas</HI> came to me in the morning, and told me, That I must prepare to go to the Temple, where the <HI>Osparenibon</HI> or Mar∣riage Solemnities were to be celebrated. He told me farther, That the same was kept four times a year, and that it was the greatest Festival they had, though much inferiour to
<PB N="93" REF="58"/>
that of <HI>Sevarundè,</HI> which was the most magnificent in the world. I got up and put on the new Cloaths that were brought me, and to every one of our Principal Officers who came to my Chamber to go with me to the Temple along with <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Car∣shidà</HI> our perpetual Leaders. We went toge∣ther to the Palace, where <HI>Albicormas</HI> had gi∣ven us Audience, and having passed through several Courts we came at last to a large and magnificent Temple, where we saw a great many young men and women together in new Apparel, and wearing upon their heads, the men wreaths of green boughs; and the women Garlands of Flowers. They altoge∣ther made the loveliest show that ever I saw, being most of them very proper and hand∣some.</P>
<P>The farther end of the Temple was kept from our sight by a large Curtain which di∣vided it almost in the middle; we stood there near an hour, looking upon the rich Orna∣ments, and the several Objects of the place before we heard or saw any alteration, but at the last we heard the sound of several Trumpets drawing near to us; we heard likewise the Harmony of many Flutes and Houboyes, which played very sweet and airy Tunes. Then came in a great number
<PB N="94" REF="59"/>
of People with lighted Torches in their hands, and set them up in divers places of the Temple, where hanged divers Candle∣sticks disposed in a very good order. The Windows were close shut up, and the Cur∣tain drawn, which discovered the other end of the Church, where we saw at a distance a great Altar very rich and magnificent, adorned with Garlands and Festons of fresh flowers ingeniously done up together. About it, and in the Wall, against which it was set up, we saw a great Globe of Crystal, or ve∣ry clear Glass, as big about as four men can fathom, which cast such a light as enlight∣ned all that end at a very great distance. On the other side was a great Statue, represent∣ing a Woman with many breasts, and suck∣ling as many little Children, all very curi∣ously cut. In the middle of these two Figures we saw nothing but a large black Curtain, plain without any Ornaments. While we were looking upon these Objects, the Mu∣sick came nearer and nearer, and at last into the Temple. Then turning our eyes that way, we saw <HI>Albicormas;</HI> with all his Senators, coming towards the Altar in great Pomp and State. As soon as he came in, several Priests went to meet him with <HI>Thuribula,</HI> Censors in their hands, and singing a Can∣ticle.
<PB N="95" REF="59"/>
They bowed to him three times, and then turned and lead him to the Altar, where he and his men inclined their bodies three times to the Curtain, twice to the Luminous Globe, and once to the Statue: Then he took his Seat on the right hand of the place against the Wall, where several high Thrones were set up to receive him and his Company, and so many on the other side on the like manner. <HI>Sermodas</HI> brought me to a Seat un∣der <HI>Albicormas</HI> his feet with three more of my men, and placed the rest over-against us on the otherside.</P>
<P>We were no sooner set down but three of the Priests went towards the young People, and called them to the Altar. They divided into two parts, and all the Men came order∣ly on the right hand, and the Women on the left. Then did the Principal Priest stand up on a high place in the middle of all, and made a short speech unto them; which done, fire was brought in lighted by the Sun∣beams, as I understood afterwards. This fire being brought in, <HI>Albicormas</HI> came down to the Altar, where he lighted some Aromati∣cal sticks that lay upon it with that fire, and kneeling before the Luminous Globe, spake aloud some words, which then I could not understand. From the Globe he went
<PB N="96" REF="60"/>
to the Statue, and bending down one of his knees only, he made there another short Speech or Prayer, which done, the Priests sang an Anthem, which was answered by the People. When this short Anthem was ended, several Musical Instruments began to play very sweet and melodious Tunes. A Chorus of men and women succeeded these Instruments, and sang so Divinely that we all thought we were in Heaven, our Voyces and Musick in <HI>Europe</HI> being not comparable to these. When this Symphony was ended, the chiefest Priest went to the young woman, who stood at the upper end of the Row, and asked her, <HI>Whether she would be married?</HI> She, making a low inclination, and blushing at the same time, answered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then did he go to all the others, asked them the same question aloud, and received the like answer. The same was done on the other side where the young men stood, and when all these questions were asked, and answe∣red, the Priest went again to the uppermost Maid, and asked her, <HI>Whether she would mar∣ry any one of the young men who stood on the other side?</HI> Whereunto she answered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then did the Priest take her by the hand, and brought her to the uppermost young man of the other row, and bid her chuse her Hus∣band.
<PB N="97" REF="60"/>
She looked upon the first young man, and then upon the others successively, until the came to the sixth, and there she stopped and asked him, <HI>Whether he would be her good Lord and faithful Husband?</HI> He answered, That he would be so, <HI>if she would be his loving and loyal Wife.</HI> Which she said, <HI>She would be till death should part them.</HI> After this solemn and mutual promise, he took her by the hand, kissed her, and walked with her to the lower end of the Temple. All the others did successively do the same till they were all marched down by Couples.</P>
<P>But there remained eight young women who could get no Husbands: Five of them seemed to be full of confusion, and tears trickled down their eyes in great abundance. The three others looked not so dejected, and when the Priest came to them they got hold of his Robes, and went along with him to <HI>Albicormas.</HI> He spake some words to them, and then they went to three several Sena∣tors, and said, That since it was their ill fortune not to be able to get single men to their Husbands, they made choice of them to take away their reproach that lay upon their heads, after having three times been slighted publickly. Therefore they desired
<PB N="98" REF="61"/>
them, that, according to the Laws, and their particular priviledge, they would receive them into the number of their Wives, pro∣mising to be very loving and faithful to them. The three Senators came down immediate∣ly, took them by the hand, and carried them to the Altar, where they stood till all the others came up by Couples. The five afflicted Virgins were asked by one of the Priests, <HI>Whether they had a mind to chuse any of the Officers?</HI> To which they answered, <HI>That this being the first time they had tried their Fortune, they were willing to try twice more before they took that course.</HI> Then pulling down their Vails they marched out of the Temple, and got into a Chariot, ready to receive them at the Gate, and so went away much discontented.</P>
<P>As soon as they were out of sight the Musick began to play very merry Tunes, and <HI>Albicormas</HI> going to the Altar spake some words aloud, and taking the three first Maids, and the three Senators, joyned their hands together, and spake some words, to which they made answer, and bowed very humbly to him. He did the like to seven or eight Couples more, and at last leaving the Office to other Senators, he went up again
<PB N="99" REF="61"/>
to his Throne. The like Ceremony was used to all the rest, and when it was done, two Priests took the fire from the Altar, brought it to the middle of the Temple, and the new married Folks made a ring about it. Every one of them had some Gums or Per∣fumes in their hands, and each Couple mix∣ing them together threw them into the fire: Then kneeling down, laid their hands upon a yellow Book, which two Priests held in their hands, <HI>Swore obedience to the Laws, and promised to maintain them to the utmost of their power till the end of their lives, taking God the Sun, and their Country to witness of their Oaths.</HI> Then did they march to the Altar again, where <HI>Albicormas</HI> made a short Prayer, they being upon their knees, and turning towards them gave them his blessing, which done, he marched out of the Temple, all the Com∣pany following after, and the Musick play∣ing all in a Consort. Next, they went into a great Hall near unto the Temple, where stood many Tables, which were immediately covered with meat.</P>
<P><HI>Albicormas</HI> took me and <HI>Van de Nuits,</HI> told us we should be his Guests that day, and bringing us to the uppermost Table, sate down with his chiefest Officers, and made
<PB N="100" REF="62"/>
us sit with them. <HI>Sermodas</HI> took the rest of my men to another Table, and the Com∣monalty of our People, who stood in a Gal∣lery all the time of the Ceremony, were carried home again by <HI>Carshidà</HI> and <HI>Benos∣car.</HI></P>
<P>We had a very noble Feast, several Instru∣ments of Musick playing all the while we fate. After Dinner we marched out into the Amphitheater, which stood about a Musket shot from the Temple, and all the way we went we found the Streets strewed with herbs and flowers, and heard the acclamati∣ons of a great multitude of People, who came out to see us pass. This Amphitheater is strongly built with very large stone, and is no less than fifty paces Diameter, counting from outer Wall to outer Wall. It is cove∣red with a prodigious high and large Vault, which shelters the place from the Sun, and from all injuries of weather. There are Seats round about it one over the other, from top to bottom, which take up a great deal of Room, and streighten the Pit to an indif∣ferent bigness. The upper Seats were full of people, and none but the Officers and the new married Folks were admitted into the pit except some young men, who exercised
<PB N="101" REF="62"/>
themselves a while in Wrastling, Fencing, Leaping, and in many other acts of Agility, which was no unpleasant sight. Then fell our People to dancing, and kept so till it was almost night, at which time the Trum∣pets and other Instruments sounded out a retreat. We marched out in the same manner as we came, and found in the Streets many fire-works, which made a second day of the night. <HI>Albicormas</HI> and his Company went home in their Chariots, and the new marri∣ed people to the Lodgings prepared for them, where I suppose they enjoyed one another all night to their hearts content: and <HI>Ser∣modas</HI> carried us home again, where he explained to us several parts of the Cere∣mony. The next morning he came to us and asked whether we would go to the Tem∣ple again to see another Ceremony which was but a consequence of the former; to which we readily assenting he carried us away, and made us stand a while at the Temple-gate. Soon after we heard a sound of Musick com∣ing towards us, and saw the new married men coming to the Temple, each of them with a long and green bough in his hand, where were hung up the Wreath he wore the day before, and his Wives Garland, tied toge∣ther
<PB N="102" REF="63"/>
with a white Clout stained with bloud, which were the marks of his Wives Virgi∣nity. They came all into the Temple in a triumphing manner, and being come to the Altar laid down their Garlands upon it, con∣secrating them <HI>to the Deity, to the Sun, their King, and to their Country,</HI> which is repre∣sented by the Statue I spake of before. After this Consecration they went out dancing at the sound of the merry Tunes, the Instru∣ments played till they came to their homes.</P>
<P>This Festival lasted three whole days with a general joy and merriment throughout the whole Town.</P>
<P>Now our time was come to leave the City of <HI>Sporundè,</HI> and to march to <HI>Seva∣rindè. Sermodas,</HI> gave us warning of it the day before we went, and carried me, <HI>Van de Nuits,</HI> and <HI>Maurice</HI> to <HI>Albicormas</HI> to take our leave of him. We went together to his house, which we found to be a noble and stately Palace, though much inferiour to the City Palace both in bigness and state. He received us very kindly, and told us that the day following we must take our Journey to <HI>Sevarindè</HI> to wait upon <HI>Sevarminas.</HI> Then he asked us how we liked <HI>Sporundè,</HI> and the Ceremonies we had seen in the celebration
<PB N="103" REF="63"/>
of the <HI>Osparénibon.</HI> We answered, We liked every thing even to admiration. You have seen nothing yet, and you are going to a place as far above this as the Sun is above the Moon. I will not too much prepossess your minds with the glory of it, knowing experience will teach you more than I can tell you. <HI>Sermodas</HI> is to be your Guide, he will be very tender of you, and I admonish you to take his Counsel in every thing, and to carry your selves so prudently that the great <HI>Sevarminas</HI> may love and cherish you as heartily as I have done. Then he kissed us in the forehead, and bid us fare∣well.</P>
<P>The next morning early we were carried to the Waterside on the West part of the City, where we found several great Barges ready to receive us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> brought me and three or four of my men into an indiffe∣rent big one, but rarely carved, gilt, and painted. Our other men and women were distributed into other Vessels, and in that manner we rowed up the River, which running through a very flat and Champain Country flowed down very slowly. We saw along the Banks of it several great buildings like those we had seen below the City. We
<PB N="104" REF="64"/>
had many Rowers, who relieved one ano∣ther from time to time; so we went up with great speed, and never stopped till we came to an indifferent great City, called <HI>Sporumè,</HI> about thirty miles above <HI>Sporundè.</HI> We were expected there at that day, and so we found great numbers of people upon the Key, who came out to see us land. A little before our Barge came to the City, a Vessel full of seve∣ral Officers, cloathed like those of <HI>Sporundè,</HI> came to meet us, and some of them leaping into our Barge expressed a great deal of re∣spect to <HI>Sermodas,</HI> and much civility to us. We went ashore with them, where stayed for us the Governour of the place, called <HI>Psarkimbas. Sermodas</HI> and he embraced one another, and had some discourse together, after which he kindly saluted us, and bid us welcom into the Country in the Latine Tongue. Then addressing himself to me, embracing me, and kissing me in the Fore∣head, he said he would be glad to have a lit∣tle private discourse with me sometime of the next day. I answered, I was at his com∣mand, after which we followed him into the City, which we found to be built much after the manner of <HI>Sporundè,</HI> and about half as big as it, standing in a fine and fruit∣ful
<PB N="105" REF="64"/>
soyl, the best manured and tilled we had ever seen before. We were received and used in this place as at <HI>Sporundè,</HI> without any great difference, and stayed there all the day following, not observing any thing re∣markable in it but the exemplary punish∣ment which in the afternoon was inflicted upon fourteen Malefactors in this man∣ner:</P>
<P>They were taken out of Prison fast tied together with Ropes, and divided into three parts. In the first were six men, who as we were told had been condemned to ten years punishment, some for Murther, and others for committing Adultery. In the se∣cond were five young women, whereof two were condemned to suffer punishment du∣ring seven years, to satisfie the Law, and afterwards so long as their Husbands pleased, and this was for having lain with other men. The three others were condemned to suffer three years punishment for having been de∣bauched before their <HI>Osparenibon</HI> was come, or the time of their marrying, which is at the eighteenth year of their age. In the third were the three young men who debauched these maids, and they were to suffer the like punishment, and at last marry them. They

<PB N="105" REF="65"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="106" REF="66"/>
were carried from the Prison to the Palace Gate, where stood a great multitude of peo∣ple to see the execution.</P>
<P>These poor Prisoners were stript of all their cloaths from their shoulders to the middle of their bodies, and we saw their naked skins very plainly. I remember that one of the women, who had committed Adultery, was a very proper and lusty wo∣man, not above one or two and twenty years of age. She had a very beautiful face, black eyes, brown hair, and a delicate clear skin. But her breasts, which we saw quite naked, were the loveliest I ever beheld. This was the first time she was brought to her punish∣ment, so that her shame was extraordinary. Tears trickled down her cheeks in great abundance; and these instead of taking off from her natural beauty, did on the contra∣ry so much add to it that I never admired any thing like this beautiful Criminal. Ad∣mirarion produced love, and pity joyning with those two Passions did so move the hearts of all the Spectators, that there was hardly any ingenious Person who was not moved to an extreme compassion. But their pity was turned to a kind of generous in∣dignation, when they considered that with∣in
<PB N="107" REF="66"/>
a few moments all these divine Charms were to be soiled and prophaned by the cruel stripes of a barbarous Executioner: Yet this was an act of justice ordained by the Laws against a Crime which among those people is look'd upon as one of the greatest; so there was no means to save this lovely Person from the rigour of the Law, and the Officer had already lifted up his scourge, and was going to strike, when of a sudden her Husband, running through the croud, cried with a loud voice, Hold, hold, hold. All the Spectators, and the Officers them∣selves, hearing this voice were much sur∣prized, and turned their eyes on the side from which they heard the voice come, sus∣pending the execution till they knew what this mans meaning was. He came to them almost out of breath, as having with much ado passed through the crowd, and, addres∣sing his Speech to the chief Officer, said, pointing at his Wife, Sir, I am that mise∣rable womans Husband, and therefore much concerned in this Execution. Before she re∣ceive her punishment I desire to speak some∣thing to her in your presence, after which you will know more of my mind. Then having got leave of the Officer, he spake to
<PB N="108" REF="67"/>
her in this manner: You know <HI>Ʋlisbè</HI> with how great a passion I loved you for the space of three years before our Marriage; You know likewise, that since we have been uni∣ted my love hath rather increased than de∣creased and that I have given you all the testimonies of a tender, sincere, and con∣stant affection for these four years that a wo∣man could expect from her Husband. I was perswaded that you had for me the same Sentiments, and that your flame was equal to mine; and as criminal as you have proved, since I believe still that I have the best share of your divided heart, knowing that you have been seduced by the wicked <HI>Claniba's</HI> wiles, and subtil devices to com∣mit a crime which you would not have com∣mitted out of your natural Propensity. Within this three hours I have been inform∣ed of his wicked practices, and know that you could not be drawn to comply with his desires till you were perswaded I had wrong∣ed you, and done with his Wife that which, in your ill grounded indignation and desire of revenge, you have since done with him; If I had known so much before, you had not come to this place in this infamous manner, and I would rather have forgiven you
<PB N="109" REF="67"/>
the wrong you have done to our Conjugal bed, and concealed your Crime than brought you to this severe and shameful punishment. I cannot altogether free you from it, because you must satisfie the Law and your Country which you have grievously offended; but if the tears I see you shed, and the sighs and sobs I hear out of your mouth be true signs of repentance, if you have still in your breast any remainder of that love so sincere which you once professed to me with so many ob∣liging demonstrations, and if you promise me that you will wholly give me your heart again, I will save you from the cruel stripes that are ready to fall upon you, and suffer them mine own self, rather than see them laid upon you. Speak <HI>Ʋlisbe,</HI> and let not your silence be an Argument of your ob∣durateness, and indifferency for me; There he stopt, and the woman, almost drown'd in her tears, was silent a while before she could utter any words, but at last she re∣turned him this answer, My silence, O too Generous <HI>Bramistes,</HI> is not an Argument of my obstinacy, or indifferency, but of my shame and confusion. I have injured you contrary to the Sacred Laws of Justice, and honour; I have defiled our Conjugal Bed,
<PB N="110" REF="68"/>
and whether I have done it out of a just revenge, or out of any other cause, I am guilty, and deserve to suffer a far greater punishment than is ordained for the ex∣piation of my Crime; Do not trouble your self for me, I am a fit Object of your indignation, and just revenge, and not of your undeserved pity. All that I beg of you is That you would believe that I am truly penitent, and that I would endure with gladness the cruellest torments, and at last lose my wretched life to satisfie you if it were possible. Why should you receive upon your innocent body the stripes which ought justly to fall upon mine? Ah, why should I be freed from a pain due to me, and not to you? To make it short, there was a long Contestation betwixt the Hus∣band and the Wife, which made all those, who could hear them, shed tears; and at last the business came to this, That the Man received the Blows which were pre∣pared for his Wife. He was tied with her, and they, with all the other, were whipt three times round the Palace, and then sent to Prison again. It seems that the Women in that Country have that priviledge to be exempted from such
<PB N="111" REF="68"/>
chastisement if any body will suffer it for them, whereof I was told that there had been many examples upon several occasi∣ons. After this Execution we went home again, where <HI>Psarkimbas</HI> and I had above an hours discourse together about the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> and such like matters as <HI>Atticormas</HI> and all the other Officers had been inquisitive of.</P>
<P>The next morning we took leave of <HI>Psarkimbas,</HI> and went to the Water-side again, where we found other Barges ready to receive us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> went into one of them, taking me and the other person who travelled with us before, and so we rowed up the River five or six miles above it, where we found a Town consisting only of eight square Buildings like those of <HI>Sporumè</HI> There we found other Barges of another fashion waiting for us, so with∣out losing any time we went into them, and were drawn up by horses against the stream of the River, which growing strong in this place, we could not row up any farther. The Town we left behind was called <HI>Sporunidè,</HI> and, as we were told, was governed in the same manner as the other were. As we went up the River we drew
<PB N="112" REF="69"/>
nearer and nearer to the great Mountains <HI>De Haes</HI> had seen at a distance when he was near the Lake in his discovery of the Island over against the old Camp. They stretcht from East to West as far as we could see, and appeared very high and steep; we had spied them long before we came to this place, but now we could see them very plain.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sporunidè</HI> we were drawn up to another lesser place fourteen miles above it, called <HI>Sporunikè,</HI> where we took fresh horses, and went up eight miles farther the same day to another little Town, called <HI>Sporavistè,</HI> where we lay that night, and where we observed nothing remarkable.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning we found several Chariots and Wagons ready to re∣ceive us; <HI>Sermodas</HI> took me, <HI>De Nuits,</HI> and <HI>Maurice</HI> only to bear him company, and so leaving the River on the West side we went directly to the Southward, and drew nearer and nearer to the Mountains, the ground rising by degrees as we went towards them, although the Country be flat and plain to the very foot of them, which is the reason of their steepness.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="69"/>
As we went thorow the Country we saw here and there many Towns and Buildings, and came to a place called <HI>Spo∣raguestè</HI> about eleven of the Clock; There we took some rest and refreshment till Two in the Afternoon, and pursuing our Journey came in the Evening to the very foot of the Mountains, where we found a pretty big Town, called <HI>Sporagondò,</HI> where we were received with much kindness by <HI>Astorbas</HI> the Governour of it. The Town consists of fourteen Squares, and is the last we saw in <HI>Sporumbè.</HI> We were treated there as in other places, and rested our selves all the day following; we saw nothing con∣siderable in it, or about it, but the rare Canals which are drawn up and down to water the Country, which is full of fine Pastures, always green as we were told.</P>
<P>These Canals by Walls, Bridges, and Sluces convey abundance of water from the Mountains to this Plain, and the work is so vaste and costly that the like could not he done in <HI>Europe</HI> for fifty Millions of Livers, yet the Industry of these People has done it without money, for they use none in any part of their Dominions.

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have here recommended to thy perusal the Second Part of the rare Country of the <HI>Seva∣rites:</HI> a Country so curious and so pleasant, that if thou hadst ever been there, thou couldest never have had the least inclination to dwell in any other part of the World. I know some will be carping and quar∣relling at this Narration, like those unreasonable Animals, that are al∣ways fretting to see things with which they are not well acquainted.
<PB REF="76"/>
But these poor Souls that have seen nothing but the compass of their Cradle, and have confined their knowledge within the narrow limits of their own Territory, cannot well conceive nor imagine the glorious things, and the strange Wonders that appear to Travellers beyond the Seas in Foreign Nations. Ca∣ptain <HI>Siden</HI> was one of the most famous of his Time, a Man well known for a worthy and approved Person. What account he hath gi∣ven of these rare People is not so publick, I confess, as could be wish∣ed, because the Persons and the Na∣tion, who have now a Correspon∣dency in those Parts, have discou∣raged all others, by declaring these
<PB REF="76"/>
things to be fabulous, because they intend to ingross all the Trade to themselves. The Advantages many <HI>Dutch</HI> Families have received by them already, is incredible. The vast Treasure they have heaped up in a few years, is beyond all belief. They have met with some new Mines of Gold in this golden Country, and raised their Families to an extraor∣dinary Grandeur. It is an idle hu∣mour in any of us to despise or re∣ject strange Discoveries. If all our wise Forefathers had been of the same temper, the <HI>Indies</HI> had always been unknown to the <HI>European</HI> People, and we should again burn such as dare affirm, that there is a <HI>Jamaica</HI> or an <HI>America,</HI> a World
<PB REF="77"/>
under us. Our Nation heretofore, and the <HI>French</HI> Court, lost the ad∣vantage which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath well improved, through incredulity. It is therefore good in all such cases as this, to weigh the Reasons and Arguments on both sides, and to judge of the probabilities of this Coun∣try. If any thing is here related of this Country or People seemingly beyond all possibility, we must know, that as this People have the advan∣tage of living in the earthly Para∣dise, they have knowledges of Na∣ture and natural Effects, which look like Miracles. Captain <HI>Siden</HI> and his <HI>Dutch</HI> Camrades visited many places, and saw some other Islands thereabouts, which are as full
<PB REF="77"/>
of Curiosities as those we have here taken notice of. But that this Re∣lation might not be too voluminous, and the Account too tedious to the ingenious Reader, I thought fit to set some of his Papers aside, and speak only of the chief Country of the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> hoping that these lines may give some an incouragement, when they are at <HI>Cap de bon Esperan∣za,</HI> to direct their Course a little out of the way, and to visit this Coun∣try, which lies Southwest and by South from the Point. If the Charge and Danger don't discourage them, doubt∣less some brave generous Soul may get to himself an immortal Name, and Wealth enough to pay his Charges, if he returns as safe as Captain <HI>Siden</HI>
<PB REF="78"/>
did. However I wish that this Narrative may give you all as much satisfaction as you can desire or wish for.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE <HI>SEVARITES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT the foot of the great Mountains we rested three days upon the Borders of <HI>Sevarambè,</HI> in a little Town called by the Inhabitants <HI>Cola,</HI> from the delightsomness of the place; for it stands upon a small Rising, and is wa∣tered by three pleasant Rivers, <HI>Banon, Caru,</HI> and <HI>Silkar,</HI> which render the ground there∣abouts extraordinary fruitful beyond all credit, to a miracle. For some have told me, that they have usually in their fields every year four Crops of Corn, because the ground wants neither heat nor humi∣dity to bring forth, and is never parched with the drought of Summer; for here as
<PB N="2" REF="79"/>
well as in all the Kingdom of <HI>Sevarambè,</HI> they know no difference between Summer and Winter, unless it be by the course of the Sun and Stars, which draw nearer to or farther from the Northern and Southern Poles. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had here many old Ac∣quaintances, and particularly a she-friend, who caused us to stay in this place longer than we purposed at first. For our great expectation and earnest desire was to pass over the Mountains into <HI>Sevarambè,</HI> to in∣joy the delights of that Paradise on Earth. But whiles <HI>Sermodas</HI> was diverting himself one way, he caused some Divertisement to be given us another way, that our abode there might not seem too tedious. He in∣treated some of the chief of the place to shew us their Gardens of Pleasure, and to lead us out into the Fields to hunt the Ostrich with Beagles, and Grey-hounds, or Dogs not much unlike that sort which we have in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Hunting was perfor∣med in Parks, where this sort of Game was kept for Diversion. The pleasure that it afforded to us, and the extraordinary acti∣ons which were thereby represented, cau∣sed us not to think the time long, or our abode in that place tedious, though we were in great expectation of injoying
<PB N="3" REF="79"/>
sweeter Delights beyond the Mountains in a Country so far excelling all others in the World, according to the relation which had been given to us.</P>
<P>It is the usual custom of all Travellers that pass often through this Town, to have a she-Comrade, with whom they are wont to spend some days. For in the Country of <HI>Sevarambè</HI> such kind of natural delights are not allowable by the Laws of the Country, nor agreeable with the strict lives and se∣were Customs of the Inhabitants, nor with the nature of the Air; for at the first enter∣tainment of inordinate lust, such disorder happens in the blood and veins of men, that their countenances are immediately chan∣ged, and their skins are covered with Boils and Scabs, chiefly their Noses, which have so great a correspondency with the noble Members. For this cause the Inhabitants of <HI>Sevarambè</HI> abominate the least sign of all lasciviousness. I never was amongst a more temperate and orderly Generation. All Passengers therefore use to make a due pre∣paration before they can or are admitted to pass over the Mountains. At this Town of <HI>Cola</HI> therefore Travellers stop to refresh themselves with those delights which are only allowable in <HI>Sporumbe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="80"/>
After three days rest <HI>Sermodas</HI> had provi¦ded all things needful for our passing over the Mountains, some Provisions and Car¦riages. We had to each man of us an Uni¦corn appointed to carry us. This Creature by the skill of the <HI>Sporvi</HI> are brought to be as tame as our Horses. They seemed to me far stronger and more swift, and so sure footed, that though we climbed over Rocks and Mountains, there was none of them seen so much as to stumble or fall. Instead of a Bit and Bridle we held in our hands a silken cord tyed to the horn, which was in the front of the Beast, and at the least mo¦tion it would bend and turn, and go a swifter or slower pace, according to our desire. I inquired several things concer¦ning this Animal, which I could never hear of in all <HI>Europe. Sermodas</HI> gave me great satisfaction, and informed me of its nature, properties, and excellent qualities, so that I had brought some over with me into my own Country, had not this transportation been forbidden by the Law of that place.</P>
<P>We took our leaves of <HI>Cola</HI> about noon after a plentiful Dinner. An Unicorn of a Chestnut colour, with many black spots on the right side, and white on the left, was prepared for me to mount upon. At the
<PB N="5" REF="80"/>
first when I saw the nimbleness of the Beast, I was afraid to venture my self upon it, and could not be perswaded to make any use of it, till <HI>Sermodas</HI> assured me, that it was one of the gentlest Creatures in the World, and so extraordinary swift, that we passed over the Mountains through uneven ways into <HI>Severambè</HI> in a day and a half, being near threescore or fourscore miles.</P>
<P>These Mountains are not inhabited by any other thing but Lions, Tygers, Pan∣thers, and such wild and ravenous Beasts as care not much for the society of men. We had the sight of many thousands of them in our way, and saw the Roman Sports of their Theatres and Amphitheatres in the bot∣toms, when we were on the side of the Hills; for there we met with these surious Beasts contending for their prey. Two Bears were devouring an unhappy Deer, which by chance was by them surprised in Thicket or Bush of Brambles. They had no sooner seized upon it and overcome it, but in steps the Lion to share in the sport. The two Bears would not allow him any part, therefore one steps back to encounter him, whiles the other held the innocent Deer half dead; but the Lion being too strong for the first Bear, the second ran in
<PB N="6" REF="81"/>
to rescue him with that fury, that made the Lion leave his hold. The fight lasted about an hour, with such a variety of sport, that we could not pass on in our Journey, till we had seen the end. At last the Lion had so bit¦ten the Master-Bear by the legs, that he was scarce able to stand; which when the Lion perceived, he retreated from him about an hundred paces, and then was too strong for the other Bear, which had unadvisedly pur¦sued him. After a short dispute the Bear ran away, and left the Lion alone to his dinner with the lame Bear in sight, which sent to him many snarlings and wishful looks waiting till this King of Beasts had well satisfied his appetite. But when the Lion had well filled his paunch with the Deer flesh, and that he endeavoured to drag away the rest, the two Bears seeing his greedi¦ness, gave the Lion another assault, and obliged him to depart with a good piece of flesh in his mouth, leaving the remainder to the hungry Bears that devoured all to the very Guts.</P>
<P>In pursuance of our Journey we were carried over a high Mountain named <HI>Spora¦kas;</HI> the top reaches to the second Region of the Air, and is always covered over with Snow and Ice in this hot Country. There
<PB N="7" REF="81"/>
is a very clear Fountain of water which yields a plentiful stream running down the Rocks and Mountains of various ascents, and by the fall and diversity of the noises and rumbling of the water, gives to the Passengers a pleasant Musick. When I was within a mile of the place, I thought I had heard some Trumpets, Drums, and war like Harmony, Flutes and Hoboys, and such other windy and watry Instruments of Musick. What! said I to <HI>Sermodas,</HI> what means this warlike Musick that we hear? Is there not an Army coming before us? This question caused <HI>Sermodas</HI> and all the <HI>Sporvi</HI> to smile. No, said <HI>Sermodas,</HI> we have no need to fight amongst our selves, this Country is more free from all disputes and contentions than any other under the Sun. We are not pinch'd with those necessities that are apt to make you <HI>Europeans</HI> so mad and furious one against another. There is nothing of oppression or violence to be seen here. We are never assaulted by any Ene∣my: All our Thieves, Robbers, and disor∣derly persons are confined to the skirts of our Dominions where they live to plague one another, but they are not suffered to abid in the middle and bowels of the King∣dom. Since <HI>Noahs</HI> Flood, whereof we
<PB N="8" REF="82"/>
have more certain Memoires than you in <HI>Europe,</HI> there was never any disorder nor War in this place, or in the Country round about, because of the excellent Orders and useful Laws of this Country, which I shall hereafter represent to you. At the top of the Mountain we lodged in a Tent which Nature had prepared in a Diamant Rock, with several Apartments. The Rock stood in a plain ground, as high as the great Steeple of <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> It occupied about an Acre of ground, having many transpa∣rent Turrets round about at the middle of it. There was an entrance into it so lumi∣nous and glorious, that I thought the Sun had made here its abode, and that there was one within as well as without in the Heavens. In the first room we rested our selves, and unloaded our Unicorns. Some of the company gave them Provender, o∣thers kindled us a fire; but <HI>Sermodas</HI> led me and <HI>Maurice</HI> by the hand to take a full view of this stately Palace. When we had gone round, and seen the glory of it, and taken notice of the brightness of the Diamant with the crystal Turrets, and steps by which men may climb up to the top, and which are made of Ice congealed and hardened into Crystal by length of time, we retur∣ned
<PB N="9" REF="82"/>
to our company to take a share of the fire they had kindled; but we were no sooner sate down in the niches about the Wall, but out comes a Leopard followed by a wild Masty from some inner rooms where they had been sleeping all the day. Now the noise of men had awakened them, and obliged them to seek another more quiet retreat. The entrance was stopt with our Fardels and Goods to keep out the cold wind that blew in. When therefore we perceived them running and walking a∣bout, we ran to our Arms to defend our selves from their fury. But stay, said <HI>Ser∣modas</HI> to me, we need not stir, you shall see pleasant sport, if you will sit quietly. He had no sooner spoken the words, but the Leopard and the wild Masty began to sa∣lute one another with grim looks and fu∣rious crys, which ended not without a sharp dispute for mastery. Sometimes the one had the upper hand, anon the other would tread his Enemy under foot. They were so furiously set one against another, that they took no notice of our being there, nor of the fire kindled in a corner, till two of our company, by the order of <HI>Sermodas,</HI> dis∣charged two Guns upon them. The Bul∣lets killed the Leopard, but the wild Dog
<PB N="10" REF="83"/>
retreated into the inner rooms; where he remainded till the next morning, that we fetched him out with fire, and dispatched him also. We were mightily afraid at their first appearance; but when we per∣ceived how little they regarded us, and how speedily they fell foul of one another, we were well pleased with their company, for the room was large enough for them and us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> led us into every chamber, and corner of this Diamant Palace, where we had the sight of all manner of Prospects and snapes of Beasts and Birds graven there with Natures finger to delight Passengers when they pass over these rough Moun∣tains into <HI>Sevarambé.</HI> I shall forbear from giving any exact Description of it, for fear this strange account, incredible of it self, should injure the rest of this Story, and cause my Reader to suspect the truth of all other passages of these Travels in this re∣mote Country. The night we spent in such pleasant dreams, as made us <HI>Europeans</HI> to laugh heartily in our sleep. We fancied our selves in a most glorious Paradise, and were not willing to depart the next day. Had not <HI>Sermodas</HI> promised to bring me back the same way, I had prevailed upon him to have staid there a few nights, that
<PB N="11" REF="83"/>
we might have again a taste of our drowsie delights, and of our imaginary happiness, which to us was as good as any real and true.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot a Custom observed by all the crooked <HI>Sporvi,</HI> when they come to this place, to prepare themselves to go down into the glorious and fruitful Vallies of <HI>Sevarambé.</HI> They wash themselves all over their bodies in a Mineral Fountain of a Water, which to the eye appears very yel∣low, which Fountain stands at a stones cast from the Rock; and though the Air be cold, this Fountain is hot, and of an excel∣lent virtue: for the Water cleanseth not only the filth of the body, but it hath that influence upon the humors of men, that they are freed from all those extravagant desires of Lust and Lechery, which agrees not with the Air and Manners of the <HI>Seva∣rambi.</HI> Before we went to sleep, <HI>Sermodas</HI> led me and my Companions out to this rare Fountain: Now, Captain, said he to me, strip your self naked, and wash your self in this Water: with these words he shewed me several corners, which seemed to be made purposely for men to bathe them∣selves and wash their bodies from the irre∣gular inclinations of these other Regions.
<PB N="12" REF="84"/>
After we had well cleansed our selves, we returned to our Lodging, and after supper <HI>Sermodas</HI> gave me this account of this Cu∣stom: Captain, said he to me, we are en∣tring into a Climate where men are forced to be abstemious against their wills; where if they harboured those amorous affections which other men have, they meet with so many and such powerful temptations, that they would be far more extravagant than the rest of men, and be more deformed than any people; for the Air and nature of this Country is such, that it sets a mark up∣on all men that touch any other women than their own. And such Virgins as for∣get themselves, are spotted visibly to the eyes of all beholders, as you shall see when you come amongst them. For the preven∣tion therefore of this and all other incon∣veniencies which proceed from lustful ap∣petites, we have a custom to wash our selves in this admirable Fountain, whereof the water hath that virtue to free us from those lecherous inclinations as well as our bodies from filth, and to oblige us to ap∣pear amongst the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> with a quiet and calm spirit: so that none or few dare joyn with any other female but his own. I inquired whether they had not a plurality
<PB N="13" REF="84"/>
allowed them: No, answered <HI>Sermodas,</HI> we in our Country have that allowance, and this causeth us all to be so crooked in our bodies; for this shape proceeds from the crookedness of our reason, which carries us to act and perform such things as agree not, I confess, with the excellency of our humane nature, but only with those natural propensities, which we either by Art or re∣solution should restrain within the compass of a moderate appetite. But you are en∣tring amongst the soberest people of the World, free from all those wild passions which cause so much disturbance in other Lands. They are the perfectest and most beautiful Ladies that ever you beheld, all their Country and all things therein are stately, glorious, pleasant, rich and noble, and so extraordinarily full of innocent de∣lights, that you would be content to abide there for ever.</P>
<P>This short account, with the many relations that we had already of this Country, inflamed our desires to be Eye∣witnesses of these rare things, and to injoy the stately advantages that this place and Country afford. Therefore the next morning early we washed and prepa∣red our selves for our Journey. But there
<PB N="14" REF="85"/>
happened an accident which retarded our Journey for a while. As soon as our Uni∣corns were loose and ready to be loaded, a Jaccal happened to run by in sight of these Animals. As soon as they perceived it, they ran after it so swiftly, that one of the foremost caught the Jaccal, and killed it: for there is a natural Antipathy between these two creatures, as there is between a Hare and a Grey-hound. At the first sight of a Jaccal it is not possible to keep in the Unicorn, who is naturally carried to pursue this ravenous Beast. This gave us the trou∣ble to run about a mile after them to the declive of the Hill, where the Unicorns were all dividing the spoils of the dead Jac∣cal: one was tearing the tail, another was busie about the Head, another was devour∣ing the guts; they had all shared it amongst them. When we had brought them back, we all mounted, and went on in our Jour∣ney. About ten miles in our way, at the top of a very high steep Hill, we saw the great City of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> and the beautiful Country where it is situate. Here the <HI>Sporvi</HI> are wont to perform certain Cere∣monies before they dare venture farther; for they imagine, that if they neglected or contemned them, the Great Spirit of the
<PB N="15" REF="85"/>
Air, which governs in that Climate, would punish them with some signal token of his displeasure, as he doth such as are given to Debauchery and Lechery. I and my Com∣rades were all obliged to follow the same Customs and Manners, for fear of giving offence, and for avoiding those deformities and marks which are said to be inflicted upon all Contemners of the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>In our Travelling we had the sight of many strange Creatures, Animals, Birds, and Insects, whereof I knew not so much as the name. The Trees in our Road were hung with Apes and Monkies: the Woods full of aromatick Trees and sweet Perfumes: the Mountains and Wildernesses were in∣riched with Diamant Rocks and Banks of Crystal: the Rivers and Streams of Water are full of sandy Gold and precious Stones transparent. When I considered how rich and delightful a place the descent of these Mountains was, I judged that the Coun∣try beyond, and the Bottoms and Vallies must consequently exceed all that I ever beheld on Earth. One thing I cannot o∣mit: we saw in our travelling a Beaver pursued and hunted by a Creature not much unlike in shape to our Rabbets,
<PB N="16" REF="86"/>
but of another nature, more ravenous and fierce. For Eagles and Vultures of all kinds and sorts, they were here in such numbers, that the Sky was sometimes darkned with them.</P>
<P>In the way <HI>Sermodas</HI> gave me and my Companions several precautions how we should behave our selves amongst the <HI>Seva∣rites.</HI> First he advised us to talk but little: For, said he, they are the wisest of all men. If therefore you will gain any esteem, or hinder your selves from being despised, ab∣stain from too much discourse; for if they perceive, by a multiplicity of words, any indiscretion in you, they will contemn you, and not think you worthy to abide in the Land, much less to be honoured by them. Again, take heed of swearing, cursing, or damning; for such irregularities in lan∣guage were never yet admitted into that Land. They spue or banish out all disor∣derly persons, and confine them to the Bor∣ders. Observe next to do as you see other men, and take heed you be not singular in any practices: but when once you are ad∣monished by them, imitate them, and fol∣low their good advices; for in so doing, you will preserve your selves in their esteem, and shew them respect. Obsti∣nacy
<PB N="17" REF="86"/>
and singularity are vices not known amongst them as they are amongst you <HI>Europeans.</HI> Take heed that you drink not too much of the delicious Wines of the Country, but use all things with abstinence and moderation. Refuse not any gifts which they will bestow upon you; for they are all noble and generous in their beha∣viour and actions, and love not to see their favours slighted by Strangers. I shall, said <HI>Sermodas,</HI> inform you what to do, and give you other directions, as I shall see occasion, that you may pass with credit through the Country of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> When he had ended his discourse, we thanked him for his kindness, and promised him our ready obe∣dience to all that he should require from us. He seemed to be well satisfied with our compliance with him from the beginning. Thus we travelled along till we came to the foot of these high Mountains to the passage of a large River three times bigger than the <HI>Danube</HI> or the <HI>Rhyne.</HI> It is called by the <HI>Sporvi Cocab,</HI> and by the <HI>Sevarambi Rocara.</HI> It runs at the bottom of the Hills, and incompasseth the Kingdom of the <HI>Se∣varites</HI> almost round, till it meets with ano∣ther large River, which together unite their streams, and fall into the Pacifick Sea
<PB N="18" REF="87"/>
beyond the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> about one hundred Leagues Southwards. At Sun∣setting we came to the banks of the River, but could not get over till the next day; for there is no Bridge suffered to be made, because the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are not willing to give such an easie access into their Country. They are afraid of two things, of the Vices of Strangers, and of their Diseases, which causes them to set Guards at the mouth of their Rivers, and all the ordinary Passes, lest a sudden Invasion should disorder their quiet and earthly tranquillity. This cau∣sed us to stop upon the sides of the River till the morning; for the Boat which was to carry us over and our company, was then on the other side, and after Sun-set there can no man be admitted into this happy Country: besides there are many things to be examined of Strangers before they can be received into the Boat. We lodged therefore all night at the foot of the Moun∣tains in a beautiful Arbour or Bower of Jesmine mixed with Rose-trees, which in this place flourish and bear all the year long; for here neither Snow nor Frost is to be seen, nor such cruel winds as hinder the Fruits of the Earth. The Bower was about an hundred paces from side to side,
<PB N="19" REF="87"/>
so that our Unicorns and Goods lay and rested with us in the same place all night. Whiles our Supper was providing, <HI>Sermodas</HI> took me and my Companions to walk with him near the Rivers side, and to discourse with me about the Wonders of Nature, the delightsomness of the Prospect, the clearness of the River-water, the sweet harmony of the Evening-birds, the pleasant noise of the Crystal-streams, together with the comfor∣table brieses of Wind, which amongst the branches of the Chestnut, Orange, Cedar, Elm, Oak, and other Trees, which here upon the sides of the Mountains grow na∣turally without planting, and promiscuously together, made such an Angelical Musick, that we imagined our selves in Paradise, and wonderfully contributed to our satis∣faction in our Walk. <HI>Sermodas</HI> being in the middle of us, asked how we liked this abode: It is, replied <HI>Maurice,</HI> the most glorious that I ever was in. You will see and know something more when you get over the River, and behold the excellency of those things which are there confined. I asked him how it came to pass, that we in <HI>Europe</HI> were so ignorant of this Country, and why this should excel all others. This question, replied <HI>Sermodas,</HI> requires a long
<PB N="20" REF="88"/>
discourse to give an answer to it; but I will not leave you without some satisfacti∣on. You must know, that when <HI>Adam,</HI> the first man, had offended his God by disobe∣dience, he shut him out of the earthly Pa∣radise, and would not suffer him nor his wicked Posterity to injoy the pleasures of that pleasant abode. They had liberty to inhabit round about, but for two thousand years Paradise was guarded in such a man∣ner, that none could enter into it all that time. Afterwards came the Flood, which turned and altered Mountains and Vallies; therefore we have some Records that tell us, that the earthly Paradise, which, during the old World, was in <HI>Asia,</HI> was then trans∣ported hither, and all those rare Trees, with the Jewels and Riches, were carried hither by Angels, and planted in this remote corner. And because there was no man then fit to inhabit so blessed a place, of the Sons of <HI>Noah,</HI> a new couple were formed, not out of the slimy Earth as the former, but out of a purer and more delicate sub∣stance, out of some Metal mixed with Gold and Silver: hence it is, that their bo∣dies are so clean, pure, glorious, and splen∣did as you shall see. This couple, named <HI>Chericus</HI> and <HI>Salmoda,</HI> are the Parents of all
<PB N="21" REF="88"/>
the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> from their loins proceed the numbers of beautiful men and women, which you shall see on the other side of the River. They had an hundred Sons and as many Daughters, and lived, by our Re∣cords, two thousand years; afterwards he was buried in the City of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> where you shall see his Sepulchre. When men and women began to increase, his eldest Son <HI>Sevarias</HI> appointed Laws for men to govern their actions, and to avoid all kind of confusion. These Laws we can shew you in our Registers, subscribed by all the men of those days. In his time there hap∣pened some Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> to be carried by the stormy winds upon these Coasts. At their landing one of them met with a beau∣tiful Virgin called <HI>Serissa,</HI> whom he ravish∣ed and got with child. She brought forth Twins, a Boy named <HI>Bubo,</HI> and a Girl cal∣led <HI>Chrestona.</HI> These two being crooked, could not meet with Matches amongst the <HI>Sevarambi,</HI> who despised them: Therefore when they came to the Age of thirty, they matched and increased strangely. When <HI>Sevarias</HI> our Law-giver saw how numerous they were like to be, being a just man, would not destroy them, neither would he suffer the pure Race of the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> to be
<PB N="22" REF="89"/>
defiled or mixed with the filthy Generati∣ons of the other part of the World. He sent a way <HI>Bubo</HI> and <HI>Chrestona</HI> with their old <HI>European</HI> Father and their Mother <HI>Serissa,</HI> with all their Children and Grand-children to build the City of <HI>Sporunde,</HI> and to inha∣bit the Country on this side the River, ap∣pointing a certain Tribute for us to pay as an Acknowledgment that we are descend∣ed partly from the same stock: hence it is, that we are all so deformed, and a little crooked, and that the true <HI>Sevarites</HI> will not be perswaded to joyn with us in Marriage, and yet they love us as brethren, and have a natural inclination for all men in general, which obliges them to be courteous, kind, affable, liberal, and bountiful to them all when they happen to fall into their hands. <HI>Sevarias</HI> our wise Law-giver appointed to us distinct Laws, and in some respects con∣trary to the rest of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> according to the crookedness of our <HI>European</HI> nature, which he saw could not live up to that na∣tural Sanctity which became us as men. He gave us therefore liberty to make the vilest of our female Sex Slaves for our con∣veniency in times of need, and in travelling up and down our Country; but such pra∣ctices as these are not agreeable with the
<PB N="23" REF="89"/>
strictness of the lives of the rest of the <HI>Se∣varambi,</HI> they abominate such mixtures; and though their Country inclines them as much as any to the flesh, they cannot be perswaded to make use of it out of the rules and ways prescribed to them. And if at any time they forget themselves by chance, the Air and Country is so great an enemy to such practices, that it distinguisheth them from all the rest by some visible mark upon their Noses or Foreheads, which cau∣seth them to be immediately banished out of the Country to the Confines over ano∣ther River on the other side of the King∣dom, where they have the liberty to live deprived of all the pleasures of this earthly Paradise. Thither are confined all the dis∣orderly persons, the lecherous, the filthy, and base, each sort have their distinct pla∣ces of abode, or Islands from whence they are not suffered to depart till they dye na∣turally: For our wise and ever glorious Law-giver commanded us not to put men to death for any mistake, forgetfulness, or miscarriage of their lives. Killing is per∣mitted by our Laws only in defence of our own persons; all other Offenders against the Municipal Laws of the Land are bani∣shed to the Borders, where they live to re∣pent
<PB N="24" REF="90"/>
them of their wickedness, and most times dye good men. I shall give you a farther account of the excellent Laws and Manners of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> when we shall be on the other side amongst them; for they will not be perswaded to venture over into these parts, for fear of infecting themselves with Foreign Customs and Manners, and the vicious Air, which is every where but in <HI>Sevarambé.</HI> But, Captain, said <HI>Sermo∣das</HI> to me, when we had walked about a mile from our Company, it is time for us to visit them again, for yonder comes a furi∣ous Company down the Mountains, which will force us to a retreat. I looked and saw a Party of Jaccals followed by two old Lions and some young ones running apace towards us, howling as if they had been mad: hunger makes them more furious and greedy than otherwise they would be; for they increase so fast, that in the Woods and Retreats there is not sufficient food for them all to fill their Paunches every day. Towards the dawning of the day they burst out of their Caves and Holes to seek their necessary provisions for them and their young ones. The foremost were not above an hundred paces from us, when they first declared their coming with fearful
<PB N="25" REF="90"/>
out-crys, which were signs to the Lions round about, that they had discovered some prey. We were then without Weapon, and never dreamed of any danger in so pleasant an abode. All the wild Beasts understood the Alarm of their fore-runners, and hasted to the place where the Jaccals had made a noise. A mixture of all sorts followed them close at the heels, Lions, Bears, Tygers, Elks, Leopards, and some other sorts which I shall hereafter describe. It was not time for us to stay there any longer, and see our danger hasten upon us. We took our selves to our heels, and ran with <HI>Sermodas</HI> towards our Bower, where all the <HI>Sporvi</HI> had put themselves in a posture of defence as soon as they heard the noise. But we could not make such haste, but one of the foremost Leopards caught <HI>Maurice</HI> by the Coat, and tore off a piece, which the furious beast de∣voured, and gave him time to escape; ano∣ther bit me by the Buttocks, and held me so fast, that I could not get away from him. In the mean while all my Company run be∣fore, every one shifting for himself. I thought my self lost, but I was resolved to struggle for my life. The less hopes I saw of escaping, because several Companies of other ravenous Beasts were near at hand. I
<PB N="26" REF="91"/>
turned therefore my self and pulled the Leopard by the Ears, thrusting one of my fingers into his right Eye. The pain forced him to let go his hold, which as soon as he had done, he leaped upon me with his open Jaws, into which I thrust my right hand and took hold of the Tongue, necessity adding more strength to my Arm, I pluckt it by the root whiles the beast held me with his Paws. At that instant six roaring Lions, and three Bears, with an infinite number of Jaccals, had overtaken and surrounded me, but none offered to touch me. I flung amongst them the Leopards tongue, which they all greedily catched at with a short dispute, which of them should have it. This gave me leisure to run about a dozen paces from them before they had ended it. As soon as a Lion had taken it for his share, the rest fell foul upon the Leopard, which was become so troublesom to them, because of his extraordinary howling, that they minded me not so much, only an old Bear made after me, and overtook me. When I saw <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Maurice,</HI> and all the Company hastening with Weapons to my rescue, their sight and coming gave me some hopes of escaping out of the Jaws of an unavoidable death. The Bear gal∣lopped
<PB N="27" REF="91"/>
after me, and was just at my very heels, when I stumbled and fell flat on my face, the Bears fury caused him to run about a dozen paces beyond me over my body, before it could stop; then were <HI>Ser∣modas, Maurice,</HI> and all the rest come in with their Guns, and other Weapons, and one for my self. As soon as I had got a Sword in my hand, I ran at the Bear, and wounded the beast in the right Thigh at the first blow, but at the second I thrust it in at the breast, and wounded him at the heart. In the mean while all our Compa∣ny were not idle, they fell upon the wild Beasts with their Swords and Halberts in their hands, and killed in a short time twenty Lions, thirteen Bears, and forty Jaccals, with threescore other sort of fu∣rious and ravenous Creatures. We found dead the next day one like a Bull with six Horns, two small ones a little above the Nose, two a little bigger under the Eyes, and two great ones upon his Head. This beast is called <HI>Suja,</HI> and lives upon the spoils of other Animals. We saw another having a Head like a Lion, a Skin like a Crocodile, and a Tail as a Fox as red as blood, the Claws were bent in, but when they were stretched out, they were about a
<PB N="28" REF="92"/>
foot long, and as sharp as Needles. <HI>Sermo∣das</HI> told me, that this was the most furious beast in all the World; for nothing can escape out of its Jaws and Claws, it tears in pieces all that it meets with, and were it not that it hath but a small appetite, it would devour all the Lions of the Woods. He told me, that the <HI>Sporvi</HI> called it <HI>Forabab,</HI> and that there are no Females of them to be found, because they are begot by a mix∣ture of Lions and other Animals which co∣pulate together. We killed two other beasts as big as ordinary Masties, but so extraordinary furious, that none are to be compared to them. We continued the slaughter near two hours, rescuing one ano∣ther when the wild beasts were too hard for any of us, and had worsted us. The rest we put to flight, having wounded most of them: three of the <HI>Sporvi</HI> in our company were bit in their Limbs, and six of us run through the Arm with the Claws of the Lions. After this fierce Encounter, which was not above three stones cast from our Bower, we went, very joyful to have escaped the danger, to refresh our selves with a good Supper of Roast meat and Fruit, which was ready prepared for us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> embraced me and <HI>Maurice,</HI> ex∣pressing
<PB N="29" REF="92"/>
much joy for our escape out of this great danger, because none of us had been devoured by these furious Inhabitants of the Woods. After Supper he walked into the Air, and met with a Shrub tree upon the bank of the River, called <HI>Mezola,</HI> he took a stick from it, and rubbed the Wound of my Buttocks, and before the morning I was perfectly cured of my Wounds, as all the rest of the men hurt by the beasts: For had he not applied this to our Wounds, we should have been lame, and hindred thereby from passing over the River into <HI>Sevarambe.</HI> We laid our selves down up∣on the Banks and Beds of Earth made un∣der the Bower for Strangers to rest them∣selves, and slept all night, only we were interrupted by the howlings of strange Creatures and beasts of prey, who ranged about the Bower, attempting to enter in, but we had stopt the passages and ways, so that there was no entrance for any of them.</P>
<P>The next morning a large Boat was on this side to carry us over with five grave Signiors, two came to our Bower to call to us before we were up, and visit us. The chief Owner of the Boat was named <HI>Kibbus.</HI> As soon as we heard them we rose and
<PB N="30" REF="93"/>
dressed our selves. <HI>Sermodas</HI> went out to give <HI>Kibbus</HI> an account of our persons and misfortunes: which when he had under∣stood, he entred in with him, and took us by the hand and kissed us, bidding us be of good chear, and that his Prince would be joyful to see us. We went with him to see the slaughter of the wild beasts which we stripped of their skins, because the <HI>Se∣varambi</HI> are great Lovers of Furs; and this was a noble Present, which we intended to give to their King. As soon as we had dispatched our business, <HI>Kibbus</HI> with his Companions called us one after another to ask us, whether we had any infirmities or distemper in our bodies: after this he cau∣sed us to wash in a Fountain hard by, and gave us green Gowns, which he had in his Boat on purpose for all Travellers, butto∣ned before with rich Buttons of Jasper stones. They were perfumed in such an ex∣traordinary manner, that I never saw the like. After this and some previous Cere∣monies, we were admitted with our Uni∣corns into his wide and large Boat, and in an instant we were carried over to a small Town, where I beheld the most beautiful men and women of the World. They all knowing us to be Strangers, of a Foreign
<PB N="31" REF="93"/>
Country, went to the banks of the River to salute and welcome us. At the head of them was a grave Gentleman with ruddy cheeks, and a comely countenance, and a long beard of bright hair, which in the Sun shined as if they had been of gold: he was attended upon by six most beautiful tall young Men, who were followed by four of the female Sex, whom I cannot liken to any but to Angels: they surpassed all that lever beheld with my eyes on Earth. These were his Children. They took <HI>Maurice</HI> and my self by the hand, asked of our welfare and Country, and spoke to us in very good French. I was glad to meet in so remote a place a man that spoke that Language, I desired to know his Name: My Name, said he, is <HI>Zidi Marbet.</HI> All the rest of the Town did him Obeisance when he passed by them; for he was a man of great Riches and Authority, and of an excellent Memo∣ry and Wit. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had some private discourse with him near the River; after∣wards he marched with us into his Town to his Palace, the most glorious thing that I ever beheld, and yet that was nothing to what I saw afterwards. The Town lay up∣on the banks of the River, and had six uni∣form Streets abutting to the Water. The
<PB N="32" REF="94"/>
Houses were for the most part built all of white and black Marble, very curious to the eye: they were covered over with a shining Slate, which seemed to be gilt with Gold before every door. In a wide empty place grew several aromatick and excellent rare Trees for pleasure and profit. We all admired to see the place, sometimes we stood astonished at the beauty of the men and women, anon we were ravished with the glorious and delightsom abodes. Where∣ever we cast our eyes, we saw nothing but that which deserved our wonder and admi∣ration. <HI>Zidi Marbet</HI> walked with us with his company, and led us to his Palace, which excelled all the other houses in beauty. At our entrance we saw two Posts of pure Ivo∣ry, ring'd round with Gold, with a little Court paved with white and black Marble. The House was built almost in the same manner as the rest, but surrounded with the most beautiful Trees, and moted with a Draw-bridge of black Wood like Ebeny, having Chains of Gold instead of Iron. In the Water the Fish were in such plenty, and so great, that we saw hundreds as we passed by. At our first entrance we stood in a¦maze to behold the glory of the inside, we could not sufficiently admire the beauty
<PB N="33" REF="94"/>
and splendor of the rich Moveables, the Hangings and Tapistry over-laid with Gold and precious Stones, with all other things which can never be believed, if I should offer to relate them. Here we stopped se∣ven days, till we had News from <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> whither we had sent word of our Arrival, to know the Kings Pleasure. In the mean while I cannot express the delights which were given to every day; the sweet Con∣certs of Musick, the pleasant Walks about the Town, the Recreations of Hunting, Fishing, Hawking, and other Sports, were not wanting to us, with many other Past∣times. <HI>Zidi Marbet</HI> and his whole Family were extraordinary civil to us. The Town were not wanting in their respects.</P>
<P>At the end of seven days, <HI>Sermodas</HI> our Guide, with the rest of our Company, set forward towards <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> where we ar∣rived in six days. The Journey was the most pleasant that ever I had been in. There was scarce any manner of Recrea∣tion or innocent Pleasure belonging to our bodies, but we found it in the way. All our senses were ravished with their de∣lights; the Ears with the sweet Harmony and Tunes of all manner of Singing-birds, with the grateful Crys of all sorts of Crea∣tures:
<PB N="34" REF="95"/>
our Eyes beheld all the most glorious Sights which are to be seen in all the Earth: the Fields, the Towns, and Cities, the Woods, the Vallies, and Mountains refresh∣ed our Eye-sight with new objects of plea∣sure and wonder at every moment: our Noses met with the rarest Perfumes; every Bush and corner yielded to us new delights of this kind. For our Taste we had every where such Dainties and rare Wines, that are not to be expressed. One thing I took great notice of, That all those Creatures which are elsewhere, are to be seen in this earthly Paradise; as Lions, Bears, Wolves, Jaccals, &amp;c. and tame beasts, as Sheep, Cows, Camels, Oxen, Horses, &amp;c. but they are not of the same nature, as elsewhere. The wild beasts, as soon as they swim over the River of <HI>Rocara,</HI> lose all their fierce dis∣positions, and become as harmless and mild as Lambs; for they feed upon grass and Insects, without offering to meddle with any living Animal. Likewise they, as well as the tame beasts, have another cry, not so harsh and unpleasant, as every where else. Their crys are more grateful to the ear. All things, in a word, are so ordered, as if they were purposely intended to delight and increase the pleasure of the Inhabitants
<PB N="35" REF="95"/>
We saw in our Journey many strange birds and tame beasts, not to be seen in any other part of the World. The Fields almost in every place are watered with fresh Streams and Chanels, full of all manner of fresh water fish: so that in every Town and Village we saw many Fish-ponds incompas∣sed about with the rarest Trees in Nature. The ground is so extraordinary fruitful, that it is ordinary for them to gather three or four Crops every year of several forts of grain. So that it is no wonder, if men and creatures are here so numerous. Every two miles we met with a good Town in our way, some more, some less glorious than the rest; but built so regular and uni∣form, that I judged that these <HI>Sevarites</HI> were not ignorant of the humane Sciences and Arts, which are imperfectly known in other parts of the World. <HI>Sermodas</HI> infor∣med me, that for Philosophy, the Mathe∣maticks, Astrology, and the rest, they were all trained up in them from their youth. They chiefly excel in all delightful Sciences and Arts, as Musick and the Mathematicks. Every Child about fourteen years of age can play upon all manner of Instruments, with that dexterity and nimbleness, that I have often wondered to look upon them, and
<PB N="36" REF="96"/>
hear such ravishing Tunes and Airs, which our Musicians are not acquainted with. They are not much skill'd in Physick, nor in those Arts, which mens Vices and Diseases cause the <HI>Europeans</HI> to inquire in∣to; for seldom any distemper seizeth up∣on them, till they fall away with old age, and drop into their graves. I never saw any deformity amongst them, but such va∣riety of Beauties both in men and women, that we were all ravished to look upon them. These Beauties in the female Sex were not pitiful and effeminate, as amongst our women; but accompanied with a great deal of Majesty, Modesty, and Gravity to∣gether. It is not possible to instance all the several particulars and instances of their beauty; for there was as great a variety in that excellency of the body, as there is a variety and diversity in the deformity of ours in <HI>Europe. Sermodas</HI> entertained us in our Road with many delightful and sa∣tisfying Stories concerning these <HI>Sevarites.</HI> But I intend to represent them in the se∣veral Chapters or Heads unto which they properly belong.</P>
<P>We had in our Journey a sight of many Eagles and Vultures; but I was told, that they prey upon nothing but Insects: and
<PB N="37" REF="96"/>
for venemous creatures, there are none to be found. They know not what it is to live always in fear, to be poysoned by Asps, Scorpions, Snakes, or to be devoured by flying Serpents and Crocodiles, which in other Kingdoms swallow man and beast. So that in all respects this Country is the hap∣piest, the most pleasant, and abounds with so many necessaries to the life of man, that it is not possible to imagine any thing more.</P>
<P>We saw many Diamant Rocks in our way, with which the Inhabitants imbellish their Houses. We saw some Rocks of Ja∣sper, of Sardonyx, of Beryl, and Emerald; for Gold and Silver and Brass, they find these Metals, but rough, as plentifully as we do in other Countries, stones. But as they never make use of Money, they resine the Gold for no other purpose but to adorn themselves and their Dwellings, and for other civil uses. Silver they have in great a∣bundance, and Brass much more easie to be purified than ours in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> be∣cause Nature being hotter and more power∣ful, performs that in the bosom of the Earth which belongs to our Refiners to do, and fits the Metal for their use with a small al∣teration and labour. All manner of pre∣cious
<PB N="38" REF="97"/>
Stones are to be found here in the High-ways, in such abundance, that had our Merchants liberty to trade into these parts, they would bring down the price of Jewels, that they would not be looked upon as they are for such rich Commodities. The Cattle and the Sheep here are far bigger and better than ours, and all their tame beasts; but when they want any thing, they exchange with one another: and if they are not able to purchase it in that manner, they have all that great love and affection for one another, that they never deny things that may benefit the publick Society, or any of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> There is amongst them so much love, sincerity, good correspondence, that no Nation hath the like besides themselves. Hence it is, that poverty and want are not known amongst them. They are great Lovers of Hospita∣lity, and strive to excel one another in this Vertue. An Example of this we had in our way to <HI>Sevarinde;</HI> for in a great Town, named <HI>Bubasti,</HI> ten of the Chief men con∣tended with one another in civil manner to have us to lodge at their houses, which I may justly call Palaces: and to content them all we were forced to divide our¦selves, and to accept of all their kindnesses
<PB N="39" REF="97"/>
neither could we get away from them in a day, they had so many new inventions and Recreations to retard us till the Eve∣ning, and then they would not suffer us to depart till the next morning.</P>
<P>Our first stage was at <HI>Foralar,</HI> thirty miles from the River, where we met with Excellencies and Riches beyond all belief and imagination. The next was <HI>Fustad,</HI> a∣bout five and thirty miles from <HI>Foralar.</HI> The third was <HI>Brobas,</HI> a large City well walled, and so glorious to the eye when the Sun shines, that it dazles it. The fourth night we reached as far as <HI>Crocarambe.</HI> The fifth we entred into <HI>Bubasti:</HI> And the sixth day about noon we were received and welcomed into <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> As soon as we were arri∣ved and entred into the Palace appointed for our abode, men and women of all sorts, but of rare and compleat beauty, came in to welcome us, bringing with them of the Fruits of the Country. Amongst them a party of Musicians, a dozen in number en∣tred the Hall, where we were refreshing our selves, and admiring all the Excellen∣cies before our eyes, and the Divine Beauty of those incarnate Angels, the Women of that place. <Q>At the first they saluted us with a short Speech to this purpose in their
<PB N="40" REF="98"/>
own Language, which was immediately in¦terpreted to us by a stander by in Spanish Welcome, noble Strangers, to our City of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> let not your misfortunes and losses grieve you, the great Being of Be¦ings hath sent you to discover what I un¦derstand was never known to your World. You shall see by experience the Genero¦sity and brave minds of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> We rejoyce to have an occasion of imitating our bountiful God, and express our Libe¦ralities to his Creatures, and our kindness to men, though of another World and Parentage. This brings me and my Com¦panions into this place, and at this time to mitigate your sorrows, and cause you to forget your shipwrack and calamity▪ With these words he made a grave bow and nodded to the rest of his Comrades and immediately the Musick began to play so sweetly, that we reckoned our selves in Heaven, and not upon Earth.</Q> This Sport continued about two hours with an inter¦ruption of other Sports. We tasted there also some of the most delicious Wines of the World; they grow not as ours upon shrubs and short stumps, but upon great Trees as high as the Cedar and Oak-trees neither have they any trouble with them
<PB N="41" REF="98"/>
to manure or cut them, for the Wine-tree brings forth of its own accord plentifully. In an Orchard of these kinds of Trees about the compass of an Acre, they have some∣times ten Tun of this rare Wine, as clear as Crystal, but so extraordinary strong and pleasant, that the <HI>Vin de la Cindad</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> nor the Rhenish, nor Frontiniack, nor <HI>Flo∣rence,</HI> nor Canary, nor any other sorts of Wine of <HI>Asia,</HI> or <HI>Europe</HI> are to be com∣pared to this Divine Nectar, which so re∣freshes Nature, and strengthens the body, that the oldest persons in that Country seem to be but young. Their age is disco∣verable only by their grey hairs and long beards, which they are not to cut by the Law of the Land. That evening <HI>Sevarminas</HI> sent us a Messenger to know of our welfare, advising us to prepare our selves for the next morning to wait upon him, for he was very desirous to see us. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had been with him, and had given him an account of us, and of our behaviour since our landing in <HI>Sporumbè,</HI> and our entrance in <HI>Sevarambé.</HI> At his return to us, after Supper we desired him to give us an exact account of the ex∣tent of the Dominions of his King <HI>Sevar∣minas,</HI> and of the further most bounds of his Empire. In answer to your request, said
<PB N="42" REF="99"/>
<HI>Sermodas</HI> to us, I must tell you, That we have now a Prince called <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> li∣neally descended from our wise Law-giver <HI>Sevarias:</HI> this is the seventh thousand five hundred and ninth King, who hath since that time reigned in this Land. His Go∣vernment between the Rivers are three∣score and five Principalities: the chief are <HI>Rostaki</HI> in the West, <HI>Shafstati</HI> on the North towards the Pacifick Sea, <HI>Roblati</HI> on the East, and <HI>Manasti</HI> on the South. These are the four principal Parts of the Kingdom com∣manded by four chief Officers, who are to have an inspection over the other lesser Di∣visions. These wait upon <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and are of his Privy Council. The other Chief∣tains are to reside in their several Princi∣palities, and take care to do Justice, and punish all Offenders with Banishment to their several places appointed for their re∣treat. Besides these Jurisdictions within the Rivers, there are several other places belonging to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> which acknow∣ledge him for their Supreme Lord; but they are full of all banished men, Offenders of the Law, and Malefactors. There is the Province of the <HI>Sporvi,</HI> which you have seen already, commanded by the Noble <HI>Al∣bicormas:</HI> the next to us is the Island of the
<PB N="43" REF="99"/>
Fornicators, whom these <HI>Sevarambi</HI> cannot endure. These all appear with their rotten Noses and poysoned Faces, so that they are ashamed to shew themselves amongst per∣fect men. They live in Woods and dark Caves, men and women promiscuously, with∣out any regard to their honesty, which they have had no care to preserve. They have an ill-favour'd old Hag for their Governess, a filthy Bawd, named <HI>Brustana.</HI> Their Coun∣try affords them many good things, so that they live without much labour; but are so deformed and infectious, that none dares venture amongst them, who hath any re∣gard to the safety of his own person or Honour. When amongst the <HI>Sevarites</HI> any, either man or woman, breaks the Law by any such fleshly liberty, they are imme∣diately sent over and landed there, from whence they cannot possibly return, because there is no Boat dares carry them from thence. In this place they have a freedom to do what they list, and to please them∣selves with the choice of persons of their own disposition and temper without any restraint. The next Province is that of the Knaves, a cunning sort of men, who are all upon catches, continually plotting the mischief of others. When there is the
<PB N="44" REF="100"/>
least suspicion of any such person in a Pro∣vince of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> they never leave till they have found him out, and sent him to this place, where he is commanded by <HI>Ma∣rabo:</HI> when any excels in Knavery, he is there promoted in his Court to Offices of Honour and Trust. These have the largest and best Province belonging to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> beyond the River; for they are numerous and increase daily in number of men and in Lands towards the South. They disposses∣sed another Generation of covetous Rascals, who had been banished from among the <HI>Sevarambi,</HI> and had laid great improvement upon their Lands, having built many good Towns and Cities. When the Knaves, their Neighbours, had understood it, they caught it from them, and drove them out of it by a Trick, sending the Covetous to live in their Country empty of Inhabitants. The next is the Province of disorderly persons troubled with the distempers of discontent, fury, ambition, and other Vices. <HI>Sevarmi∣nas</HI> is forced to keep a Guard upon their Borders, and to place next to them the stoutest and most warlike souls, for fear of a sudden irruption. There are thirteen other large Provinces filled with other kind of men; but I forbear to speak of them
<PB N="45" REF="100"/>
till I shall give you an account of an attempt which the bordering Provinces made once to dispossess King <HI>Sevarminas</HI> of his Throne, and to seize upon the Territories of the unspotted <HI>Sevarites,</HI> who were forced to arm themselves, and drive those disorderly Villains into their own Nests, where they are now confined. Since that time care hath been taken to build such Walls and Forts, as that they cannot now easily pass over to trouble the Peace of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> I had almost forgotten to speak of the large Province of Fools, which lies directly South from <HI>Sevarindé.</HI> If any person, by a mischance, becomes crack-brain'd or di∣stemper'd with any kind of folly, he is con∣demned to be transported to the Island of <HI>Cracos,</HI> where he is to spend all his days in what Exercises please him best. The Country affords him all Necessaries with∣out pains: therefore the Fools lead a plea∣sant life in the Woods and Medows. Be∣fore we go out of the Kingdom, I will, said <HI>Sermodas,</HI> beg leave of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to have a Guard, and visit the Provinces of Knaves and Fools, where you shall see such Tricks and Sports, as you never saw the like. And if you desire to visit any other part of the Kingdom, I will desire leave from our
<PB N="46" REF="101"/>
mighty King, who will take care to pro∣vide for your safety in going and coming. For though in this happy Paradise there is nothing of evil, all things are answerable to the excellent and kind nature of the In∣habitants; yet round about the Borders in the adjoyning Islands and Provinces, there is as much Disturbance, War, Tumult, and Unquietness, as in any part of your Northern World; for the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> have a Law to send thither all those persons who desire to cause any alteration in their Government or Manners, or who live not according to the strict Rules which they have received from their Forefathers, and which by no means they will be perswaded to change. Some of these banished men, after a certain number of years, and a visible sign of Re∣formation, have leave to return, and to be admitted again amongst the <HI>Sevarambi;</HI> but others are so unquiet and unruly, that they are a trouble to themselves, and all that are concerned with them. There∣fore our Princes and Governors will not admit them again, for fear they should re∣lapse into the same evils, and disturb this Kingdom, which for many thousand years hath continued in peace and prosperity without alteration by the excellent Laws
<PB N="47" REF="101"/>
of our Great and wise <HI>Sevarias,</HI> the first Monarch of this happy Land. Hence it is, that we never have any change of chief Governours or Governments, every one knows his duty, his place and abilities, and is fully satisfied with the advantages that he expects from thence. Here is no op∣pression nor violence, the least inclination of that unnatural disposition sends men away to the Borders to prevent future mis∣chiefs. Neither have the <HI>Sevarites</HI> that wicked custom of coining Money, and buy∣ing and selling all things with money, the root of all Northern evils. They will not admit of any such weed to grow in this Land, but things are exchanged for one another. And you have seen since your entrance, there is so great an abundance of all good things, that men must be lovers of wickedness, that can be evil in the midst of such a plenty of goodness where it over∣flows. But I must tell you, said <HI>Sermodas,</HI> of one thing more, which causeth us to continue in peace: we are not subject to the wicked attempts and temptations of any evil Spirit, as you are in the Northern World. Those dangerous Imps care not to visit this Southern part; for they have been so often caught in the snares here, that they
<PB N="48" REF="102"/>
dread the very sight of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> or of their Country. You, I understand, in the Northern parts lay most of your miscar∣riages at the Devils door, who hath a room in many of your habitations, and a dwel∣ling in every place and corner; but we are altogether free from his company and tem∣ptations. Sometimes it is true, he sends some loose Devils to debauch a few indis∣creet persons, but then we send them away immediately to their proper places with the Fiend in their company. <HI>But,</HI> said <HI>Mau∣rice, how can you keep the Devils out of your Land?</HI> They fly in the empty Air, and go by night as well as by day. <HI>Sermodas</HI> an∣swered, Our eyes are better than yours, but the <HI>Sevarites</HI> of all men have the most refined senses. They can see when the Spirits come amongst them; for this pur∣pose there is a constant Guard kept in all the usual Roads upon the Borders of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> four hundred Conspirers, if I may so call them, are kept in constant Pay to drive away the Devil with Spells, when he ventures to approach upon the Borders. They have a particular Art to command the evil Spirits, which no man knows but themselves. It is true, some of the peep∣ing and crasty Rascals creep into this Land
<PB N="49" REF="102"/>
through by ways out of the usual Roads; but when the <HI>Sevarites</HI> catch them, they torment them sufficiently, and deal with them as with Spies, without any compassi∣on of them: so that they seldom return to this place again, but by their cruel enter∣tainment they keep all their other Com∣rades from entring in amongst the <HI>Seva∣rambi.</HI> I know that in your Countries you have not that care nor vigilancy of your selves for your own good. Hence it is, that all sorts of Devils have so great an in∣terest in your parts, and that you can scarce stir without meeting one or many in your way. Besides, this Country between the Rivers bears an aromatick Tree, which the Devils cannot endure; for it sends up into the Air such a strong smell, that they are ready to choke when they draw near to a place where it grows, and you shall see that the Inhabitants have been advised by their wise <HI>Sevarias,</HI> to plant one in every Garden and side of their Houses. The Tree is named <HI>Crassarabi,</HI> and bears a leaf like a Palm-leaf, but is full of prickles as a Thorn and Bramble-bush. The <HI>Sevarites</HI> have this way to torture the poor Devils that unhap∣pily fall into their hands: they tye them with a Cord invisible to you, but visible to
<PB N="50" REF="103"/>
them, answerable to the substance of the Devils, which is airy, and then bind them to this Tree, where they slash them with a Rod cut out of the branches, which causes them to howl most dreadfully. We may chance to give you a sight of this action, if you travel into the Country towards the Borders. Another way they have to plague and imprison them, by making Gun-pow∣der; for when the Devils come into a Land, they always draw to that place where there is the greatest noise and disturbance, for there they imagine they may make a good interest. Now there is no greater noise in this Land than this of the Gun-powder, which we make not as you do in <HI>Europe,</HI> but with a wheel, as you may see, if you travel into the Land. Sometimes therefore it happens, that the silliest of them prying too near into the work, either to understand the Art, or to know what the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are doing, they are many times caught by their ears, and I have known half a dozen wound into a grain of Gun-powder, and imprisoned so close, that they could not possibly get away, till the powder took fire. The best and strongest powder hath always some of these airy Beings shut up. This causeth the destruction that fol∣lows
<PB N="51" REF="103"/>
when Gun-powder takes fire; for then the Devils being released, break out with a vengeance, and tear in pieces all that dare stand in their way. The <HI>Seva∣rites</HI> have many other ways to punish them for the insolences and wickednesses which they have committed in the World; but when I have an opportunity, I shall give you an account of that. I could wish, said <HI>Maurice,</HI> that our Country-men in <HI>Europe</HI> knew how to deal with these subtle Crea∣tures, and how to be revenged for the con∣tinual wrongs which they daily receive from their malice and evil suggestions. It is a question, said I, whether many of them would make use of that Art, if they knew it; for a great many are so pleased with their company and suggestions, that they seek them rather, than to endeavour to be rid of them. Well, said <HI>Sermodas,</HI> let them be in love with their own mischief and danger, the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are seldom taken and deceived by their allurements: and if at any time they are carried to any wicked∣ness, they are banished; and if the Devil be caught, he is severely tortured. This good order and many others, when I shall speak to you of their Laws, preserves hap∣piness, peace, and prosperity in this Coun∣try.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="104"/>
This Discourse pleased us well, and cau∣sed us to intreat <HI>Sermodas</HI> to take some other time to inform us of the Laws of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> We asked him several other questions concerning their Government within the Rivers, concerning their Cu∣stoms and Tributes, and whether all the Country was so happy and rich as that which we had already beheld. He answe∣red to all questions so exactly, that we thought our selves much obliged to him for his singular favour. He was well acquaint∣ed with all things, for he had been imploy∣ed about the Affairs of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> from his infancy, and was often sent to carry the Tribute to his Court. He told us, that the Kings Revenues were certain, and that from all parts men brought to him all sorts of Necessaries for him and his numerous Court. That he never had any need to de∣mand more, for his Expences were as re∣gular as his Incomes; and that if he should want any thing more, there is none of his Subjects, from the meanest to the highest, but would think himself highly honoured, if he would accept of all that they have. But as he is a great Lover of Justice and Equi∣ty, he is content with the ancient Reversi∣ons of the Provinces, which are sufficient
<PB N="53" REF="104"/>
to cause him and his Court to live in great abundance and extraordinary Splendour, which all the <HI>Sevarites</HI> looked upon as their greatest Glory. <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> said he, is a middle-aged man, and hath reigned in this place twenty two years, with the general love of all his Subjects. He is adored by us all as our visible God. His Fathers name was <HI>Seravino,</HI> a Prince of an extraor∣dinary Beauty; he reigned amongst us thir∣ty years, and mightily inlarged the Palace and Dwelling of the Kings of this Country. You shall see to morrow a place which hath not its parallel on Earth for Riches and humane Glory, and you shall see a Prince and such noble Attendants, that your eyes never looked upon any thing, nor persons more deserving admiration. After this discourse, <HI>Sermodas</HI> led us all to our Cham∣bers, where we had all things convenient for us, and shewing us in a great wide room hung with Cloth of Gold, each mans Bed of embroidered Silver for him to rest till the next morning, he took his leave of us, and bid us good night. We rested very sweetly without any disturbance till the next morning, when a Concert of Musick in the next Chamber awakened us. <HI>Sermo∣das</HI> opened first our door, and entred our
<PB N="54" REF="105"/>
Room, desiring us to get up and put on the Apparel which he had brought to us. Whiles we were dressing of our selves, a Messenger came from King <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to hasten us away, because he intended to give us Audience, and then to take some Recrea∣tion before Dinner. At the time of our appearance he appointed ten Senators of his City, men of great Gravity and Worth, to attend upon us, and lead us to him. We were conducted through the Streets full of <HI>Sevarites,</HI> who seldom see Strangers in those parts. Their curiosity caused them to throng together to look upon us: we marched thus about half a mile through the most splendid places, and had the sight of so many rare objects, that the World cannot afford the like. The number of Jewels and precious Stones, the quantity of Gold, Silver, the excellency of the Stru∣ctures, Arches, Palaces, and Temples dedi∣cated to their God, are beyond all credit and imagination of men. But nothing surprised us so much as to look upon the Royal Court and the glory of it. It stands upon a small rising incompassed about with a deep River, and walled three times round with square stones cut out of a Diamant Rock about six foot square, and polished so
<PB N="55" REF="105"/>
well, that at the first approach our eyes could not endure the brightness of the place when the Sun shines clear without a cloud. Some other precious Stones were intermix∣ed of green and red colours, but all trans∣parent. There was but one entrance over the River by a Bridge. The first Gate was full of Ivory Pillars and Supporters, and embellished with large stones, black and white Marble. Round about in the void space were delicate Walks, and Gardens full of strange sorts of Trees, some yellow, others green, some black, others white, and shewing to the eye such a variety of beau∣tiful colours, that it is the most glorious Prospect of the World. The second Wall was all of a red stone, but bright and shi∣ning. The third and innermost Wall was as white as Snow, like to our Alabaster, but of a stone which is not to be found in any part of the Northern World. In the empty places round about between the Walls, grew all manner of Trees for plea∣sure or profit, with some that are not to be seen elsewhere. The Kings Palace stood within these three Inclosures, having round about it a large Green with several Walks of sandy Gold and stately Images of Alabaster and Porphyry, representing
<PB N="56" REF="106"/>
all manner of shapes, as beasts, birds, and men in most actions of their life. These Images stood upon Bases of Saphir, and the Images were all made of a transparent hard stone as clear as Crystal. You may imagine, that at our first entrance, the Sun shining in its greatest brightness upon them, we were cast into a sudden maze, and surprised at the unexpected view of so ma∣ny glorious things. The Palace was per∣fectly round, with four long Galleries reaching from side to side, and as many Gates. It was built of precious Stones, of all sorts and sizes: the Tyling was of Gold and Silver, and the inside was so curiously wrought, and so rich, that it is not to be imagined nor believed, if I should here de∣clare every particular. The King sate in an empty Court in the middle of his Palace, under a beautiful Gallery inriched with all manner of Jewels: round about him on the right and left stood his Counsellors and Attendants: his Seat was a Throne of six steps, over which there was a Canopy of State, before it were six Bases upon which stood six Lions rampant of a red stone. To this place we were conducted by <HI>Sermodas</HI> and the Ten Grandees, and led to the foot of the Throne, where we were taught to do
<PB N="57" REF="106"/>
our Obeisance upon our knees. The King had a rich Crown upon his Head, and a Scepter in his right Hand, and sate in a great deal of Majesty and Glory. <HI>Sermodas</HI> advised me to speak to the King, as soon as we had paid him that respect which was due to his Person and place. <Q>Therefore I stood up, and addressed my self to him in this manner in the French Tongue, which he understood well: Most glorious and mighty Prince, you see before you poor Strangers cast upon your Coasts by a storm, which I know not how to name, happy or unhappy; for since our Arrival in your Land, we have met with so many civilities and expressions of kindness from your lo∣ving People, that we have already recei∣ved a compensation for the loss of our Ships and Goods. We are come here to adore your Majesty in obedience to your Commands, and to receive from you those Orders, which we shall punctually follow. We doubt not but according to your won∣derful clemency, your Majesty will look with compassion upon such objects of pity as Providence hath made us, and to raise us up from our hard and low Fortune. As all things that we have hitherto met with in your noble Kingdom, are beyond all
<PB N="58" REF="107"/>
belief and credit, we are perswaded that the King of so glorious a Land, must needs have Vertues as extraordinary and Di∣vine. We humbly submit our selves therefore to your Majesties Wisdom and Mercy, and that when we shall have per∣formed what your Majesty shall think fit to require from us, you would out of your compassion and goodness, suffer us to de∣part into our own Countries, that we may spread abroad all over the World the Riches, the Excellency, and Wealth of this earthly Paradise, and the noble Ver∣tues of your most Glorious Majesty, and publish your Fame where-ever the Sun ap∣pears with his beams of Light.</Q> <HI>Sevarmi∣nas</HI> seemed to like our persons and our Speech, to which he returned this Answer: That he had sent for us, not to offer any injury to our persons: That he who was a Lover of Justice amongst his own Subjects, could not do injustice to Strangers: That the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in general were of a civil be∣haviour, and inclinable to pity the miseries of other men; but that he had given strict Orders to have a care of our persons, and furnishes with all that we should want. He told us, That not only the curiosity of see∣ing us, who were come out of remote Na∣tions,
<PB N="59" REF="107"/>
famous for their industry and wit, had caused him to send for us to discourse with us, and understand our Customs and Manners; but also to discover to us his Kingdom and the Riches of it, that we might report it in our own Lands, and in∣courage some to venture to trade with his People: That for that purpose he would appoint a place or an Island in the Pacifick Sea, where all the Commodities and Riches of the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> should be transported, be∣cause the ancient Laws, as well as the good and preservation of his Kingdoms Peace, Vertues, and Innocency, suffered him not to admit all manner of Strangers into his Borders: That he had received a good re∣port of us, which inclined him the more to send for us, and that he hoped that our conversation and behaviour would be an∣swerable to his expectation, and the kind∣ness that he would shew. After this, he inquired of our Country, how long we had been from it, who commanded in Chief, what Commodities we had of any request, what Arts and Sciences of any use to the life of man. To all these particulars, and many others, I gave him full satisfaction. So that, as a gratification, he sent for a Box of Jewels, which he bestowed upon
<PB N="60" REF="108"/>
us, together with Collars of Gold and Am∣bergriese, which he wished us to wear whiles we should remain in that Country. After we had continued with him about an hour, he rose up from his Throne, and commanded <HI>Zidi Parabas,</HI> the Master of his Ceremonies, to lead us to Lodgings provided for us in his own Palace, and <HI>Zidi Marlorat</HI> his Chancellor and chief Mi∣nister, to discourse with us about a Trade, and the means to open it with us. During our abode in those parts, we had seve∣ral meetings with him, and assured him, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation would be overjoy'd to meet with so civil a People, so sociable and amiable, and that they would quickly embrace the first motion of a Trade with them. We extolled our home-Commodi∣ties, and shewed what advantage they would reap by a conversation with us; but the Chancellor told me, That such as I was should have liberty to enter into their Bor∣ders; but Russians and Rascals of an ill life could not be admitted by the Laws of their Land. Yet they should have leave to trade in <HI>Sporumbe,</HI> and in the Islands, which <HI>Sevarminds</HI> would appoint for that pur∣pose; but that none of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> should go thither, unless it be such banished men
<PB N="61" REF="108"/>
as are sent away for their misdemeanours. I replied to him, That if he would keep away from thence such as are banished out of <HI>Sevarambè</HI> for their Knavery, we would trade with all the rest; for we and all our Country-men had rather deal with honest men than with Knaves. At last it was con∣cluded to prevent the inconveniencies on both sides, That all the <HI>Dutch</HI> should land amongst the <HI>Sporvi,</HI> and in an Island that is at the mouth of the great River <HI>Rocara</HI> in the Pacifick Sea, about an hundred and thir∣ty Lagues from the Streights of <HI>Magellan.</HI> This Island is peopled with a generation of men descended from the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and ba∣nished out of the Country for their inordi∣nate love of women and men. There are three good Towns belonging to it, and a capacious Harbor for Ships of the greatest burden. I acquainted the Chancellor with our Art of Navigation, with many other knowledges which the <HI>Europeans</HI> use with great profit and advantage to their King∣doms. He seemed to be well satisfied and mightily pleased with the account I had given him. Whiles <HI>Sevarminas</HI> was gone to hunt and sport himself, <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led us round about the Gal∣leries and Walks, shewing us the rare Fish∣ponds,
<PB N="62" REF="109"/>
the stately Orchards, the riches and beauty of the Buildings, and all things round about, which caused us to wonder, and stand many times in a maze. The Art of Painting is here also, and the <HI>Sevarites</HI> excel in that skill. Therefore the Galleries, and generally all the Palace of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> was adorned with many lively Representa∣tions. <HI>Maurice,</HI> who was an excellent Painter, admired some Pictures, and told us, that he thought they could not be made but by a Divine hand. The <HI>Sevarites</HI> are excellent in Geometry and Astrology. They have differing names for all the Stars that appear in their Hemisphere, and under∣stand perfectly well all their Motions and Vertues. As soon as we returned from our pleasant Walk, we met with <HI>Sevarmi∣nas</HI> about dinner-time returned from his Hunting, whereof I shall give this short ac∣count, for this Sport is not like to ours. The <HI>Sevarites</HI> hunt not with Dogs, but with tame Foxes, of an extraordinary swiftness; they hunt Rabbets, Hares, Deer; and all other wild beasts are hunted with tame Leopards. In the morning that the King intends to see this Sport, the chief Hunts∣man hath orders to prepare all things for the diversion, twenty Leopards are then let
<PB N="63" REF="109"/>
loose in a wide Park, where the wild beast is brought. The King and all his Nobles are mounted upon their glorious Mules, of beautiful colours, with Trappings of Silver and Gold, adorned with precious Stones. The Leopards, at the sight of the Lion or the Bear, draw near to him by degrees, and taking their opportunity, they run to him. When he feels himself overpower∣ed, he seeks his safety in his heels, and all the Mules gallop after him. I am not able to represent all the various actions and de∣lights that are here expressed to the Be∣holders eyes; but this kind of Hunting is much esteemed by the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and none have the liberty to make use of it, but the King and some of the prime Nobles; for it is a Royal Sport, and gives much satis∣faction to the Spectators. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> at his return entred into his Palace, accompa∣nied with all his Servants, in very rich At∣tire: some of them came and spoke to us in the Spanish Tongue, and bid us welcome into their Country. We answered their Civilities with respect, and followed the Train of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> that walked two and two into the Palace, into a great Hall an hundred yards in length, and as many in breadth, where Tables were ready covered
<PB N="64" REF="110"/>
with all manner of curious Dainties, of all sorts. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and his Queen, with three of his Sons, and six of his Daughters, sate down at a Table, which stood at the upper end, raised a little above the rest, un∣der a large Canopy shining with Gold and precious Stones, of an inestimable value. As soon as they were sate down, the Musick in the Galleries round about began to play such ravishing Tunes, that we <HI>Europeans</HI> were astonished. <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Zidi Para∣bas</HI> invited us to sit down at a Table not far from that of <HI>Sevarminas.</HI> To tell you of all the Glory and State we beheld, the sweetness of the Wines, the various Servi∣ces, and the dainty Meats, of the excellent and ravishing Sights, I reckon it impossible, I could fill up a Volume of those things that were then presented to our senses; so many and such variety of objects, rare and wonderful, appeared before us, that when <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> saw how we were plea∣sed with them, he inquired of us, whether we had any such Delights in <HI>Europe.</HI> I an∣swered, That the pleasures and delights of the <HI>Europeans</HI> are many and curious, but they are not to be compared to what we then saw. One of the Table inquired of us about some other particulars; and because
<PB N="65" REF="110"/>
he was a Learned Philosopher, he proposed to us several learned Questions relating to the Nature of things. Every one had li∣berty to speak his mind and judgment. After all, he declared his opinion, with a repetition of what every one had spoken, and then added his own solution with that Learning and Gravity, that I never heard the like. This to me and <HI>Maurice</HI> was al∣most as good as the Musick and Meats; for at Table it is a modern as well as ancient delight to feed the mind with rare instru∣ctions, as well as the body with meat and drink. After Dinner <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> went to wait upon <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and understand his pleasure. When he was returned to us again, he brought us up to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> who was then sitting on his Throne with his Queen <HI>Larida</HI> at his right hand, and his Daughters and his Sons on the left. She was the most beautiful Creature that I ever beheld. We paid them our respects according to the mode of their Country. To please Queen <HI>Larida, Sevarminas</HI> asked us many questions in Spanish, a Tongue which she understood: after all they seemed to be well satisfied. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> sent us all Gifts and Presents of a great value. When I was returned into <HI>Europe,</HI> I sold the Jewels
<PB N="66" REF="111"/>
and other Rarities, which the King and Queen bestowed upon me, for above six millions of Gold. <HI>Maurice</HI> and the rest of my Companions had Gifts according to their Qualities. We had Orders to walk about the City, and take a view of the Ra∣rities of that wonderful place. To speak truth, every thing, if it were in our own Country, would seem a rarity. I never beheld so much Glory and Riches, nor such beautiful objects, nor such gravity, and comely Personages so full of Majesty and goodness. They were so far from scorn∣ing or contemning us that were Strangers, that they seemed they could not too much honour and respect us; for <HI>Sevarminas</HI> had given that strict Order, to give us all the satisfaction that we could desire.</P>
<P><HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led us to their publick Halls through beautiful Streets, paved with many transparent stones. When we en∣tred into them, we saw their Court of Ju∣dicature. On both sides were the Lawyers Cells or little Closets. These are a certain number of men, who are locked up as Pri∣soners in this place, and not suffered to range up and down the City, for fear they should infect the rest of men with their idle notions and Quirks. They are here all
<PB N="67" REF="111"/>
kept, the Judges only excepted, as our mad and crasie men in <HI>Europe,</HI> are confined to <HI>Bedlams,</HI> and as the wild beasts to their dens; for by this Policy they preserve the City in quiet. When we were in their vast Hall, and heard some entring in, they looked all to see, whether we were fit for their turn, whe∣ther we had committed some offence that deserved punishment; but when they saw that we viewed that place only out of cu∣riosity, they sneaked all in again, and would not so much as look upon us all the time that we were there, till the Trumpet began to sound, and the Judge sate upon his Seat. Then came in a company of <HI>Sevarites</HI> lead∣ing a young Girl that had forgotten her self, and given liberty to a puny Fellow to play the wag with her. They had both of them great punches of flesh growing upon their Noses and Foreheads, which came up in the very act. As soon as their Neighbours had beheld this superfluity, they understood the crime, and took hold of them both to bring them to this Tribunal. The Lawyers, like Bees, swarmed round about, all the petty Attorneys, Clerks, Bailiffs, Sergeants, de∣my-Sergeants, Pleaders, Sollicitors, Proba∣tioners, &amp;c. and such a gang of them, that I pitied the poor Couple to fall into their
<PB N="68" REF="112"/>
unmerciful hands. Amongst the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in every City they have a Hall or a Con∣vent of these persons, whom they all esteem no better than Butchers and Executioners, they have not that honour as amongst us in <HI>Europe,</HI> nor that esteem of honest men, with which many of them cozen our World. <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> made me get up to hear their Pleading, but I understood not their Lan∣guage, only <HI>Sermodas</HI> gave me an account of some passages. The crime was not to be denied, which caused them both to look ashamed, because they had forgotten all honesty, and lost their honour. The Judge asked them many questions. All the cruel Lawyers cryed to punish her with death, because she had not given them any thing to plead for her; but the young man had got a bawling Lawyer to speak for him when his crime came to be examined; but all would not do: he would have made the Judge believe, that this Excrescence in his sace was only a natural deformity proceed∣ing from some other inward cause, and not from Lust. But the Judge, a wise and brave man, of the Court of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> convinced him of his errour, and made him at last confess, that the Girl had inticed him with her bewitching Looks. In con∣clusion
<PB N="69" REF="112"/>
of the Tryal, the lecherous couple were sent to the Island of Whores and Rogues, where they were to live confined for ever from all friends and acquaintances, and to spend their life in lust and debau∣chery, a sufficient punishment, as they ima∣gined, for their forgetfulness. I took no great delight amongst the Lawyers; for I looked upon this place as the Hell in the midst of the earthly Paradise of the <HI>Seva∣rites.</HI> After these two Fornicators had been judged and condemned to perpetual banish∣ment, where nevertheless they live in great plenty, there was brought before the Judge a Thief, a sneaking Fellow, differing in looks, as well as in manners, from the rest of the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> The Judge, whose name was <HI>Zidi Morasco,</HI> commanded him to be examined before him by a crafty Lawyer. And it was proved plain against him, that he had stole some Jewels and Gold from his Neighbour, with some Gar∣ments of Cloth of Silver, covered over with precious Stones, of a great value. The Fel∣lows countenance since this deed was migh∣tily changed; for every wicked action, especially amongst the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> alters the countenances of men. The Eyes being the windows of the Soul, through them it dis∣covers
<PB N="70" REF="113"/>
all the inward thoughts, fears, ap∣prehensions, and displeasures that rowl in the breast. Besides, the Thieves have here in this Country a mark, which immediately appears upon their Chins and Cheeks, a black spot very ugly to the eye. This Fel∣low also was adjudged unworthy to live any longer amongst the religious <HI>Sevarites.</HI> I asked <HI>Sermodas,</HI> why the <HI>Sevarambi</HI> suffe∣red the Lawyers, who I told him in our Country, were generally none of the best men in the World: What! said he, have you any there? Yes, said I, to our sorrow, we cannot be quiet for them. Captain, replied he, I must tell you, were it not for these Fellows, the <HI>Sevarites</HI> would not be able to live so quiet as they do; nor so in∣nocent as in all other Countries: fear as well as shame must keep men in awe, and in the performance of their duties to their Negh∣bours and Superiours. And though men are not here so inclinable to wickedness as in <HI>Europe,</HI> because they proceed from ano∣ther stock and generation of men; yet the pleasures of the Country, together with the inticements of some subtle Devils, whom we cannot always perceive, many may be brought to do what is contrary to Law, Reason, Equity, and Justice. It is there∣fore
<PB N="71" REF="113"/>
for the publick Good, that these men are living amongst us. And though they are as bad as those whom they plead a∣gainst, they are here confined in these and such like. Cells, where there is a publick provision made for them, to keep them from running up and down to breed distur∣bances. Such amongst them as are honest, good, and merciful men, are highly estee∣med, but they are very rare; and if they were known to be honest and good men amongst the Lawyers, the rest would not suffer them to come near the Bar, but would banish them out of their Society, and de∣prive them of all manner of Practice and liberty of Pleading. The greater Knaves they are, the more esteemed amongst the Lawyers, though less valued by the rest of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> Therefore, to keep up their credit amongst both, is a hard Chapter, and not to be done without some kind of dissi∣mulation on some side. With that he pointed at a great fat Fellow, who stood up in Court to see and look for his Clients: Do you see, said he, that Knave? Do you see him? I turned my eyes towards him, and beheld him stedfastly, and asked what he was: He is, said <HI>Sermodas,</HI> one of the chief Attornies of this Court, a cunning Fellow,
<PB N="72" REF="114"/>
his name is <HI>Rekrap,</HI> a wicked Villain, and a great Oppressor of poor Fellows that fall into his hands. After the Court had exa∣mined and tryed all the Causes, the Law∣yers departed to their Dens; and <HI>Zidi Pa∣rabas</HI> taking me by the hand, led me to the Shambles of the City, and to view all the Excellencies of that Noble place. As I was passing one of their Temples, I intreat∣ed him to give me a sight of that which I judged to be a Rarity, or rather full of Ra∣rities; for it was so glorious without, that I could not but think that the inside was far more rich and splendid. <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> made some difficulty to yield to my re∣quest; but <HI>Sermodas</HI> perswaded him to grant it at last, when he had asked me some questions concerning the Religion of our Country: Are you not, said he, desiled with Idolatry, I mean with the Worshipping of Images; for I must tell you, that this is a great abomination amongst the <HI>Sevarambi.</HI> We have Pictures and Images in our Hou∣ses, but none in our Temples: we adore a great and glorious Being, the Creator and Author of this earthly Paradise: he is an infinite Spirit, not to be consined within our walls; therefore our Temples are open on the top, when we are at our Devotions.
<PB N="73" REF="114"/>
He is not to be likened to any outward Image or Representation; therefore our ever blessed <HI>Sevarias</HI> commanded us to have no Images in our Temples, nor to liken God to any Creature or Representation visible to the eye. If therefore you have never dishonoured your self with such kind of practices, you may be admitted to see and walk in our Temples. I thanked him for his kind condescension, and assured him, that though it was a wickedness that many Nations in <HI>Europe</HI> were guilty of, yet our Country-men abominate such kind of fol∣lies, and that for my own particular I never was of that Religion which allows of Ido∣latry and Worshipping of Images. When he understood this, he walked to the great Gate of the chief Temple, where he met with a grave Priest standing at the door, unto whom he declared our business: the Priest took me by the hand, and in Spanish told me, that I should see the Temple of his God. I walked round, and saw so ma∣ny glorious Sights and such extraordinary Riches, that all <HI>Europe</HI> together cannot produce the like. The Priests name was <HI>Ziribabdas.</HI> I desired him to tell me some∣thing of the Religion of the Country, and of their Manners: for that purpose <HI>Zidi</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="115"/>
<HI>Parabas</HI> took me by the hand, and led me to a by-place much like a Chancel, where when we were all sate down, in Niches of beaten Gold in the Wall, <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> began his Discourse in this manner: I perceive you are a stranger to this Country and to the Customs of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> I know not what Religion you have in your Country, nor what thoughts you have of the Great God, who hath made us all; but I hope none of you are guilty of the foul sin of Worship∣ping of Images, which we hear is universal∣ly practised by the <HI>Europeans.</HI> I answered him, That there were a great many Nations who did abominate and hate such practices as well as the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> Well, said he, in regard you are free from that vice and base∣ness, I will shew you a great many Sacred Curiosities of this Temple, which you have not yet seen, and I will give you a brief account of our Religion in this Country. You must therefore know, that we acknow∣ledge but one only Great God, Maker of all things, Lord of Heaven and Earth, who sendeth us all those good things that we injoy: Reason teacheth to worship and praise him for his goodness and innumera∣ble mercies. For that purpose we have Schools erected in every corner of this City
<PB N="75" REF="115"/>
to train up Youth, and teach them the Principles of Religion. All persons are obliged twice every week to assist at our publick Devotions, which are Songs made to praise our God, with Instruments of Mu∣sick: we have also Prayers, which I and my Brethren offer for the prosperity of <HI>Se∣varminas</HI> and of his Royal Family. Once a year every person is obliged to present something upon a Table, which stands in the middle of this and other Temples, as a token of gratitude to God: now this thing is always the richest and best beloved thing that he hath. By this means every one shews, that his affection for God is greater than for any thing else. Religion amongst us is the most sacred thing, and whatsoever belongs to Religion is highly valued by every one. There is the greatest respect shewn to religious persons and religious things amongst all the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> you shall not hear Oaths and Blasphemies, Cursing and Damning. The Rules of good living are registred in the Book of our Law giver <HI>Sevarias;</HI> and since that time we are all so addicted to it, and all our Generations so used and trained up in our obedience to these Laws, that very few persons offer to break or violate them: and if at any time
<PB N="76" REF="116"/>
any such be, he is carried away and banish∣ed into the Islands: by this means peace, plenty, and good manners are here to be seen every where, and men take not the liberty to do what they list. But the Rules of Reason are commonly observed by all the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in their behaviour and acti∣ons: so that you shall not see any thing of Drunkenness, Gluttony, Quarrelling, Mur∣ders, and Villanies committed scarce in a whole year all over the Empire. But for our better Government in matters of Re∣ligion, besides our King, who is the chief Moderator in all disputable matters, we have thirty Chieftains under six principal Heads, who are always at the Court attend∣ing upon our Prince. These thirty live in their Precincts and Jurisdictions, having under them such as have the care of and inspection over every Town and Hamlet. We have besides, publick Meetings and As∣semblies to consult about matters of high moment. Now there is such an excellent order and harmony in all respects, that we injoy Peace both in Divine and Civil Af∣fairs, and there is no jarring, disputations, and dissensions, as amongst you in <HI>Europe,</HI> but a blessed concord and agreement. If any be suspected to be otherwise disposed,
<PB N="77" REF="116"/>
he is immediately banished to the lonesom Islands, where he can quarrel with none but with wild beasts that inhabit there. He is never suffered after to set a foot in the Country of the <HI>Sevarambi;</HI> but there in those Islands amongst the Woods and Caves he is confined, and obliged to spend the rest of his days in fighting with the Lions, Jac∣cals, wild Dogs, Bears, and such like furi∣ous Creatures. By this means you shall see we preserve peace and quiet both in Church and State. But that our Governors might not act in an arbitrary way, we suffer no mans Will to be a Law, but that of our glo∣rious <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and his lawful Successors; but for the rest of all our Governors, they have Rules and Laws to act by in all occa∣sions: neither can they do any thing with∣out the consent, advice, and concurrence of other wise men appointed for that pur∣pose. For our Belief, I must tell you, we know and are taught by Nature as well as by the Works of our great <HI>Sevarias,</HI> that God created all things in Heaven and Earth: That in the beginning this Paradise stood in another part of the World; but when men began to abuse those good things that it affords, it was transported hither upon the shoulders of Angels, and
<PB N="78" REF="117"/>
all the Trees planted here, where they have increased: and that because the first Gene∣ration of men was corrupt and wicked, there was another man and woman made to inhabit here, and to live in this blessed Kingdom. We believe, that when we come to dye, our Souls being of a spiritual substance, fly up to the Firmament, where they rest till a certain time be appointed to joyn them again together. Now our bo∣dies decay not as yours, we lay them in pla∣ces where they continue thousands of years without any alteration. I shall shew you our Sepulchres, and that of our Kings, where you may see all the Princes who have governed in these happy Regions since the beginning of the World, as fresh as if they were yet all alive.</P>
<P>We believe, that when our bodies and Souls shall be again joyned, your generation and ours shall be received together into a place appointed for us, such I mean of you as are honest and good men; but for the rest of you, I know not what you are fit for, unless it be to be cast into the Sea, or ba∣nished to a lonesom place, where they may live without doing harm. We believe that there are good and evil Spirits above us, and that the Sun, Moon, and Stars are
<PB N="79" REF="117"/>
full of Creatures answerable to their light and beauty. We believe, that when this generation shall be transported somewhere else, other Creatures shall succeed us in this Paradise, and in other parts of the World. We have many things that we believe; but I must tell you, that our rea∣son directs us, and rules our judgments in all matters of Faith as well as practice; only some things of a sublime nature, which our senses cannot attain to, we must submit to the Wisdom of our <HI>Sevarias,</HI> who had them by Inspiration from the Angels, with whom he had a familiar acquaintance, and therefore his body is not to be found in the Sepulchre of our Kings; but it is thought they took him with them into the place appointed for their abode, and that there he lives with them without fear of death, in expectation that all his Posterity should come to him. But you must take notice, That such of our Generation as are banished for their misdemeanors, will be admitted one day to the same happiness, if they bear patiently their punishment, and are sorry for their wickedness; but such also must be purged in a fire which is in the Air, through which their bodies, as well as ours, must pass to mount up to the highest
<PB N="80" REF="118"/>
station designed for us: but with this diffe∣rence, that the fire shall open to let us go by; but they must burn a while there, till their bodies be freed from all corruption and filth, some more, some less, according to their dispositions, but few stay there less than twenty years, some an hundred, others a thousand, till such time as their bodies be sublimated and fit for an higher abode. Such of us as are incorrigible, shall be con∣fined to a sad Pit, where they shall be up to the Elbows in Mire and Dirt, and be de∣prived of all comforts of life. Whiles he was speaking this, there happened an acci∣dent, which caused him to stop and put an end to this good Discourse. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> was called to receive a dead <HI>Sevarite,</HI> and open the Caves, in which the deceased lay in Coffins of Ivory and Gold. He excused himself, and told me, that he had much more to say concerning the Religion of their Country, but could not remain with us any longer. I was glad to have this op∣portunity to see their manner of burying the dead. At the great Gate of the Tem∣ple stood near a thousand people with the friends of the deceased. When <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> came to them, one who stood before the Corps and the Bearers, spoke to him in this
<PB N="81" REF="118"/>
manner, as was afterwards interpreted to me. <Q>Most holy Priest, we have brought to you our Neighbour <HI>Suffarali,</HI> a good man, and a religious <HI>Sevarite,</HI> who hath often expressed his Devotion in this place, and his respects to your Holiness; we de∣sire that he may be admitted amongst the dead <HI>Sevarites,</HI> as he hath lived amongst them with respect and honour.</Q> <HI>Ziribab∣das</HI> sate himself down in an Ivory Chair adorned with many precious Stones, which stood in the Porch, and then he called the Friends of the deceased, inquiring of them, whether he had committed no unworthy action in his life-time? Whether he had lived peaceably with his Neighbours? Whether he had not been privately guilty of drunkenness, &amp;c? Whether he had not at his departure bequeathed something to the Church? How many children he had? What were their names? And such like questions, to which they gave an answer, and satisfied him fully. Afterwards they carried in the Corps into the Temple, and laid it upon a long Table of an Emerald∣stone, and the Priests anointed the body all over with an excellent Oyl, called the Oyl of <HI>Botamine,</HI> which signifies in their Lan∣guage Uncorruption: For such is its extra∣ordinary
<PB N="82" REF="119"/>
virtue, that it keeps a body from all manner of corruption or alteration an hundred years. Now this is a Sacred Oyl, which only the Priests, who are learned in Chymistry, make of several Ingredients; for this cause it is no where to be found but in their Temples, unto which they have their Laboratories annexed. Now once in an hundred years they anoint over all the bodies of the deceased from the beginning of the World: by this means the bodies are kept fresh, and so lively and beautiful, that if a dead body could stand upright, at a distance no man could distinguish the dead from the living. When the body was well anointed, they opened a large Cave of a thousand yards broad, and as many long. It had as many Closets as there were houses in the City. <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> at the opening of the mouth of the Cave, caused some Cere∣monies to be performed, and then marched down a pair of stairs into this burying-place: the Corps was carried after him, and I and my Companions, with <HI>Sermodas,</HI> were admitted to behold the subterranean Rarities, and to walk up and down in the Caves, so full of transparent stones, that the light entring in by two or three holes, made on purpose, caused it to be as light
<PB N="83" REF="119"/>
within, as if the Sun had shined there in its Meridian. In the Cave were six hundred thousand separations, capacious enough to hold above an hundred thousand bodies: they were all laid one upon another in very good order. There were several Alleys and Walks between the separations, unto which were doors of massie Gold, and in several places stood great Pots full of that Oyl of <HI>Botamine,</HI> which the Priests cast up∣on the bodies, when they perceive any al∣teration in the bodies by their smelling. By this means it happens, that there is not the least noisom smell; but there is every where the most blessed Perfume in every corner, as if you were in a Garden of Ro∣ses, or amongst blooming Beans. When we had well viewed the Caves, I intreated <HI>Zi∣ribabdas</HI> to shew me the Sepulchres of their Kings; for that purpose he led us out at another door, when all the company was departed, and shewed us all their Princes sitting in Chairs of State, as if they were alive; but this place was not in the Cave, but round about their Temple, in Closets made on purpose. The Princes were all cloathed in their Royal Attire, which they change once every year; for that purpose the King that reigns is bound to send them
<PB N="84" REF="120"/>
Vestments according to the ancient Cu∣stom. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> shewed us all the anci∣ent Kings sitting in their gravity and Ma∣jesty, and pointed out to some who had been very remarkable in their Lives for some noted Actions, by which they had ob∣liged the Nation of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and ren∣dered their Names and Memories more sacred than others amongst their Posterity. He shewed us King <HI>Bormarti,</HI> who was so great a Lover of Justice, that he banished his own Son for committing a fault, and sent him to live and dye in the Islands. He told of his King <HI>Robarmi,</HI> who invented the Art of Painting, and laid the Foundations of <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> He shewed us the Body of King <HI>Darti,</HI> who built the stately Palace for the Kings of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and fetched the stones from the Diamant Rocks and the Mountains of Saphyr, at a great distance from thence, upon Carts driven with the Wind, with Sails as Ships. We saw King <HI>Marati,</HI> who taught the <HI>Sevarites</HI> how to make Boats, and to fish in the Rivers. We saw the Bodies of King <HI>Bumorli, Serabi, Cussori, Menari, Menasti, Nacri, Labomor, Apolori, Ribolo, Staraki, Muraki, Amlorod,</HI> and many others, who had been reverenced for some witty Invention or glorious Acti∣on,

by which they had benefited Posterity as well as their own Generation. There∣fore their Closets were more beautiful and richer than the rest, and they had the Ho∣nour to have their Images placed in the no∣ted Rendezvous of the City, for all men to look upon them, and for all Posterity to reverence and respect them. By this Ho∣nour the succeeding Kings were the more incouraged to do good, and abstain from all blame; they are the more animated to deserve well from their Generation, and to invent something to advantage their Peo∣ple. We walked about to see all the Ra∣rities of this Royal Sepulchre, which ex∣ceeded in glory the richest and stateliest Palaces of our <HI>European</HI> Emperours and Kings. To speak of the rare Jewels, of the Gold and precious Stones, and of the ex∣cellent things that were never brought over nor seen in our World, I should be end∣less; for here in every place there are red, yellow, white, and other transparent Stones of rare Vertues, not known to us in <HI>Europe.</HI> Orient Pearls as big as Walnuts are as or∣dinary as Pebble-stones in our Country. The common people polish them, and hang them in strings about their Windows; but they seldom wear them, because they have

rarer and more glorious things to put a∣bout their necks and bodies as Ornaments, than these things, which, for want of a name, I omit. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> shewed me next the Gallery of their sacred Hieroglyphicks, which is one of the rarest things of the World. The Gallery is about half a mile long, joyning to the Temple, standing up∣on an Arch, under which are beautiful Walks and Closets, for the Learned Students in all Arts and Sciences to spend their time, and imploy themselves in their searches in∣to the Mysteries of Nature. The Wall is of a white transparent stone, as clear as Crystal, and the Gallery is paved with Dia∣mant stones square, at every six foot is a great large Window of Crystal, and the top is covered and arched over with Sa∣phyr stone. Emeralds, Chrysolytes, Rubies, Jaspers, Beryls, and other precious Stones not known to us, are without number a∣bout in the Walls. This Gallery was built in the year 3406. after the Creation of the World, by King <HI>Murabormati,</HI> a great Phi∣losopher, and a Learned Student of Natures Mysteries. In these Walls he caused the Rules of all sorts of Sciences, and the Prin∣ciples of all manner of Arts to be ingraven in black in the white stone of the Walls,
<PB N="87" REF="122"/>
not in Characters, but in Figures and dark Enigmes and Representations. Here I be∣held the shapes of all manner of Creatures of this and our World in all kind of po∣stures and actions of life, put here to repre∣sent the sacred Mysteries thereby signified to the understanding Reader. In this Gal∣lery were several hundred Learned Stu∣dents beholding and searching into the di∣rections that were given them by these Hieroglyphicks. And in some Closets, near adjoyning, were several companies of men discoursing and disputing about those things which were represented upon the Wall. We were introduced amongst them to look and sit with them, and observe their grave postures and mien; but for their Learned Lectures and excellent Dis∣courses, we understood nothing, only <HI>Sermo∣das</HI> told us, that here were all the Wits and Learned men of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> gathered to∣gether; and that for their better under∣standing of all manner of Sciences, and to perpetuate Learning, and free it from for∣getfulness, they had in the Gallery the Rules and Axioms of all Arts, with all the Definitions and other matters of any mo∣ment, needful to be known in relation to any Skill or Science; and that when any
<PB N="88" REF="123"/>
Student doubted of any matter, in these Closets the great Doctors were met to di∣rect and teach the ignorant, and improve all Arts and Sciences; and that by degrees as they improved Learning by new Disco∣veries, they were always engraven upon the Walls, after a serious and judicial Exami∣nation of the Learned Doctors, and their Approbation of such invented things and Rules: which Hieroglyphicks were graven with the names of their Authors for a per∣petual Memory. We walked three or four turns in the Gallery, and saw such variety and number of new Objects and Represen∣tations, that I have often wondered, how any one man can have that vast memory to give an interpretation to all those things of different shapes, and to comprehend all the Mysteries of such Enigmes. In some places of the Gallery the Wall was covered over with Plates of Silver, and the Hiero∣glyphicks were of Gold; but generally they were in black upon a white clear stone, and so hard, that though, as I was informed by <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> and the Priest, some of the Hieroglyphicks have been there put above a thousand years ago, yet appear as fresh, as if they had been gra∣ven but yesterday. At the end of the Gal∣lery
<PB N="89" REF="123"/>
are two large Cabinets, of a curious workmanship, and rare stone, of a reddish colour, most beautiful to the eye, curiously cut and graven. The Cabinets are full of Pictures and Images of all sorts of Crea∣tures, which serve the Learned in their Contemplations: here are also a great ma∣ny Skeletons of many Animals, with all manner of rare things, which are to be found in this wonderful Country. Here I saw a great Saphire stone, about the bigness of a Goose, in which the Heavens and the Earth were represented very lively to the eye. In an Emerald, about the bigness of a mans head, I found in one side all manner of Birds graven with the finger of Nature, and in the other all sorts of Beasts. I saw several other precious Stones, one ha∣ving the Image of a Man, another of a Horse, another of a Woman, another of a Camel, another of an Eagle, another of a River, another of a Fish, another of other Creatures, so curiously engraven, that no Artist could mend Natures work. These stones were useful not only to satisfie mens curiosity, and please the sight of the Lear∣ned; but also to teach them several things concerning those creatures, which were thereby intimated to them. We found
<PB N="90" REF="124"/>
several Learned men observing those things, and viewing them with leisure: For that purpose are several Seats for them to sit down and contemplate. Here I saw al∣so many Talismans, an Art altogether lost in <HI>Europe,</HI> and not to be recovered but from the Learning of the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> for <HI>Zidi Pa∣rabas</HI> shewed me a round stone, hollow within, wherein I saw, through many parts of it transparent, a perpetual motion of Trees, Woods, wild Beasts, and many Ani∣mals, which he told me, was but a Talis∣man made to direct such as are Learned in this Art, how to make others for the same purpose. Some are so skilful, that with a Talisman they will kill any beast or crea∣ture at a mile distance; but as the <HI>Seva∣rites</HI> are not for the destruction of crea∣tures, but for their preservation, they never make use of this Art to do mischief, but save and comfort such creatures as are decaying, and to put life into those that are dead. Only the venemous creatures and noisom Flies, if by the procurement of any evil-spirited, such are introduced into the Country, then the Philosophers have an Art to make such a Talisman, as will not only destroy the Flies, and disarm the beast of his poysonous and ill qualities; but
<PB N="91" REF="124"/>
severely punish the wicked Spirit, who hath been so bold as to send in such troublesom creatures into their Land. For this purpose I saw upon four corners of the great Church a great Giant of black Marble, holding in his right hand a pair of Rams horns, as they appeared to me; but in truth it was no∣thing but a Talisman to keep off the Devils and evil Spirits from their Meeting-place and holy Assembles. In his left hand he held a Book open, of white Marble, in which some Characters were graven, as I was told, which the Devils cannot endure to see, and therefore keep at a distance from such places. Besides, these Learned in Talismanical Figures, have the Art to make those Talismans as have an influence not only upon bodies corporeal, but also up∣on the subtle Spirits of the Air, and will bind them to a good Behaviour, or drive them with vengeance off from the place, or else so benum their senses, that they can nei∣ther stir nor move, but are as so many ma∣zed creatures, without life or motion, when they come within such a compass. For that purpose I saw upon the top of the Temple a great Eagle of Gold standing with its wings abroad on the highest Pinacle of the Temple, which <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> told me, was no∣thing
<PB N="92" REF="125"/>
but a Talisman made to drive away all subtle Spirits of the Air, or to hinder their malicious intents in that Sacred place, and amongst the people of the City. He told me, that they have some persons so well acquainted with that Art, that they can work wonders, and do any Miracle by their Talismans, kill and make alive, cure distempers, benum the minds and senses of men, draw together thousands of creatures and birds, and make them perform any action that may be named. I intreated <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> to let me see some of the skill of these Learned men in this Art. I im∣portuned him so much, that he went into one of the Closets from the Gallery, and fetched to us a grave Signior about an hundred years of age, with a long beard reaching down to his knees, and a pair of large whiskers each near a foot long. He saluted me very gravely, and led me into a private Closet, which belonged to him, out of it there was a way and a door into a stone-Balcony, of a red transparent stone, with several Bosses or Apples of Gold. He had several curious Inventions, Talismans, and other things of a wonderful Art. One thing he took in hand, about the bigness of a Bushel, having several handles to it, the
<PB N="93" REF="125"/>
substance, as I thought, was of Crystal: it had several large holes: in the midst I could see many birds, all without motion, till the grave Philosopher, whose name was <HI>Zidi Mufti,</HI> pulled a string, and set them all in a motion, then did we hear the chirp∣ing of all manner of birds, so pleasantly, that we stood in a maze and wondered; but much more, when we saw all the birds of the Air, that can be named, flying a pace towards us into the Philosophers Closet: there were Eagles, Cormorants, Magpies, Crows, Vulturs, Jack-daws, Kites, Spar∣rows, Falcons, &amp;c. I numbered above a thousand, which in less than a quarter of an hour came into the Closet, and perched up∣on the Balcony and upon the Gallery. When <HI>Zidi Mufti</HI> saw them all come, he played another tune, and all these Birds be∣gan to dance two and two, and chirp ac∣cording to their kind, very pleasantly. This sport lasted about an hour, with such a varie∣ty of action, that we could have wished it might have lasted longer. At the conclu∣sion the Philosopher dismissed them, nei∣ther at that time did any of them injure one another, but were as quiet and harm∣less, as if there had been no enmity between them. When they were gone, he took
<PB N="94" REF="126"/>
the Image of a man made in Wax; but shewing all his privy parts backwards, and with it he marched to the Balcony, where he sate up and spoke two or three hard words, to the best of my remembrance they were these, <HI>Bomralok Kostraborab A∣brolakar Bourakabou Branbastrokobar A∣brovora Birikabu,</HI> and immediately there came a company of men and women of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> that danced all naked before us in a beautiful Green: whiles he held the Image in that place, they were not able to depart from thence, but continued playing and dancing, and sporting with one ano∣ther above an hour, shewing such antick tricks, as I never saw the like; for all this they were not dishonest; but immediately as soon as the Image disappeared, every one of them departed and run away; but whiles the Image stood still, they were nei∣ther ashamed, nor could they stir from the place, so great a power these Talismans have upon the minds of men, as well as the bodies of beasts and birds. 'Tis an Art which can give as much delight as profit to those that understand it well; for they can perform those things in Nature that are most wonderful, and advantageous to the life of man. In the first Ages of the
<PB N="95" REF="126"/>
World this Art was generally known a∣mongst the Learned: and when I saw how perfect the <HI>Sevarites</HI> were in it, I wished with all my heart, that we had but some insight into the same Art and skill for the good of our Country; but our ignorance would slander such knowledges, and think it to be Magick, if we did not understand the depth of it, nor the causes that such men set a work, for many wonderful ef∣fects are to be produced by the inferiour causes, which are secret and hid to the most part of men; for such is our natural un∣skilfulness, that we know not the hun∣dredth part of those things that we may easily attain to. This Learned Philosopher gave me another diversion: he fetched his Instrument for that purpose, and caused such musical Sounds and Voices to be in the Air round about us at a distance, that we began to hang between fear and plea∣sure. When <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> saw a change in our countenance, he desired us to be con∣tented, and assured us, that we should re∣ceive no harm. The noise and voices con∣tinued half an hour, not in the Instrument, but at a distance, and with such a variety of Sounds, that I could never imagine what it was. For whiles he stayed upon the Bal∣cony,
<PB N="96" REF="127"/>
he turned the Instrument round with a little wheel, which was in the inside, but this had the power by the Talismanical Art to cause in the Air such shrieks, crys, hollowings, and sometimes such curious and melodious voices, that we were ravished and struck into admiration. We desired to know what it was that made that noise in the Air; the Philosopher told us, that they were airy Spirits, which this Talisman had the power to attract, and to oblige to break out into those shrieks and crys. This caused us to wonder the more, that this corporeal Instrument, which seemed to have nothing but material, should draw together on a sudden such powerful Spi∣rits, and oblige them to give sport to men. I concluded from these Examples, that he that understands well the Talismanical Art, is able to do any thing in Nature, to work wonders and miracles, and to delight him∣self with any kind of sport when he plea∣seth. After these passages, I saw another Philosopher, very well skilled in this curi∣ous Art, bring before <HI>Sevarminas</HI> threescore Lions roaring, with an hundred Bears, twenty wild Horses, two hundred Mastiffs, thirty Leopards, forty wild Bulls, which he caused first to cry every one according to his
<PB N="97" REF="127"/>
custom and nature, then the Philosopher forced them to dance whiles he played up∣on a musical Instrument, and they per∣formed this as exactly, as if they had been taught on purpose; but when he saw his time, he set them all together by the ears, the Dogs, the Lions, and the Bears, every one pitched upon his Enemy, and began a pleasant Fight, which lasted two full hours, with a great deal of variety of sport, which caused <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and all his Court ost∣times to laugh heartily. When he hath a desire to take any such diversion, he sends for some of these men skilled in the Ta∣lismanical Art, and they answer his expe∣ctations in all things, and bring before him whom, and what they please. We retur∣ned our thanks to this worthy Philosopher for his great pains. He answered, that he was glad to give us any delight, and that if we would visit him at some other more convenient time, he would shew us some more of his skill in acting greater won∣ders, than what we had seen; but that he had done this only to divert us for the present, because he saw that we could not stay with him long; but if we would see more wonderful things, that we should do well to come to him some morning, and
<PB N="98" REF="128"/>
to spend a whole day with him, and that then he would shew us what we had never seen, nor never should see but by his and his Companions means. We returned him our thanks again for his great kindness, and then departed with <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> who led us next to see the Treasury of the Church, which is a large Room joyning to the Porch, all arched above, with six Win∣dows on the top: the Walls were of Dia∣mant, niched with Saphirs and Emeralds, in it were Chests and Coffers full of the rarest things in Nature, offered to the ser∣vice of the great God by the Citizens of <HI>Sevarinde.</HI> We beheld with admiration the rare workmanship, the curious things, and the Excellencies that had been there laid up by many Ages, and never made use of. Some Pictures were upon the Walls of this Treasury, of an admirable hand: <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> told us, that the Painter was an <HI>European,</HI> cast upon their Coasts by a storm at Sea, and that he lived and dyed in that Country; and that the Father of <HI>Sevarminas</HI> had such an affection for him, that he gave him a beautiful young Virgin to Wife, one of the most considerable of his Court, and gave him an Estate to live on, having made him a Citizen of <HI>Sevarinde:</HI> and that he
<PB N="99" REF="128"/>
lived there fifty years, till he was an old man, leaving behind him many children, Girls and Boys, to perpetuate his name amongst the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> His name was <HI>Si∣meon van Zurich,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> man, who had a great skill in Swimming; for when he was cast away, all the Ships company was lost, but only him: they were at a distance from the shore, and could not so well swim, or were devoured by the fishes. It was his fortune to be carried stark naked on the Coast of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> in an Island full of Ladies of Pleasure, who had been banished thither for their incontinency. As soon as it was day, he found himself surrounded by a whole Troop of the female Sex, who had a great delight to see him, and came to draw him into the Country; but when he saw no men, he was afraid to venture a∣mongst them: this caused him to swim up the River into the Land in the sight of these beautiful Creatures that accompanied on the shore, and often made signs to him to land, and go no further; but he continued on till he landed amongst the innocent <HI>Se∣varambi,</HI> who cloathed and brought him to their King. He was by him entertained courteously and nobly, and provided for the rest of his days. When we had taken
<PB N="100" REF="129"/>
notice of the Treasury, and of all the great Rarities that are in it, we marched into the Church or Temple again to see the excel∣lent Workmanship, the Carving, and rare things that adorn this excellent place. <HI>Ziribabdas</HI> caused us to take notice of three Partitions in the Temple, the one, which is at the higher end, is only for their Priests and their King: the second is for their No∣bles: the third is for all sorts of persons promiscuously without exception. By that time we had seen all this, the night drew on apace, which caused us to withdraw to∣wards our Lodgings. <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led me, and <HI>Sermodas</HI> went with <HI>Maurice,</HI> our other Companions followed us to our Lodgings. We took our leaves of the generous and civil <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> the Chief Priest of that stately and glorious Cathedral-Temple of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> and thanked him heartily for his great courtesie shewed to us. When we came to our Lodgings, we found our Sup∣per ready, and we were no less prepared for it; but <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> returned to the Palace, to give <HI>Sevarminas</HI> an account of his Commission and of our Walk, promi∣sing to return to us the next day. <HI>Sermodas,</HI> my self, and Companions supped that night together, the Musick playing all the while
<PB N="101" REF="129"/>
we were eating. After Supper we had good store of rare Wines brought to us, which we received and made good use of; but, as we understood, that the <HI>Sevarites</HI> hate Drunkards and drunkenness, I advised all my Companions to drink moderately, for fear of giving an offence to those noble people. They followed my advice, and after an hour or two's discourse with <HI>Sermo∣das,</HI> we went to our beds, where we had been the night before. <HI>Sermodas</HI> brought us into the Chamber, and then bid us good night, telling us, that he would call us up the next day, and shew us some other di∣versions, as pleasant as those of the day be∣fore. We thanked him, and told him, that we should be ready to wait upon him, and that we had seen so many wonders al∣ready, that we thought that we could ne∣ver see any more: at those words he de∣parted smiling.</P>
<P>The next morning <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> and <HI>Sermodas,</HI> with twenty more Gentlemen of the Kings Court, came to attend upon us, <HI>Sermodas</HI> only entring the room, the rest stayed in a Chamber hard by till we were dressed. As soon as we were ready, two Fellows, with Flutes in their hands, ready to play, saluted us, offering to conduct us
<PB N="102" REF="130"/>
to the company that stayed for us: they marched before us, making most curious Musick, till we came to the company. A grave Signior of them stood with <HI>Zidi Pa∣rabas,</HI> and told us, that we must that day ride with <HI>Sevarminas</HI> into the Country, and that he had sent them to call upon us for that purpose. <HI>Sermodas</HI> had caused some of the excellent Wines of the Country to be brought, he caused some to be poured forth into a great shell of a Fish, which is the ordinary Drinking vessels of that Coun∣try. He caused us to taste of it, and obli∣ged all the company, before we went out, to pledge us: which when we had done, <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> led us to the door, where we saw as many Dromedaries ready sadled as we were men: we mounted upon them that were prepared for us; but when I inqui∣red for a Bridle, they bid me take hold of the Ears; for in this Country these Crea∣tures have Ears of an incredible length, they are commonly an Ell long, but very slender: so that they are fastened together as the Reins of a Bridle, at the end, with a Clasp, or some such thing. This men hold in their hands, and with this they govern or turn them at their pleasure. I must confess, I was afraid when I was first moun∣ted
<PB N="103" REF="130"/>
upon this strange beast, which is so swift, that in a day we rid over hedges and ditches and uneven places, above one hun∣dred and fifty miles. We went through the streets to the Kings Palace, where we attended not long before there came out a great Train with <HI>Sevarminas</HI> himself, I and my Companions alighted to salute and do him reverence. He inquired how we had thrived, whether we wanted any thing; we assured him, that amongst so courteous and obliging a People as his Subjects were, we thought that we could not possibly want any manner of thing needful for the life of man. He bid us get up again and ride a∣long with him, we were in all near a thou∣sand, all on swift Dromedaries: the Kings was as white as Snow, all the rest either red or black. It seems <HI>Sermodas</HI> had given the King an account of the passages of the for∣mer day: so that, to increase the more our wonder, he was resolved to shew us the ex∣cellency of his Country, and many other rare things; for that purpose he had ap∣pointed in our Road towards the Confines, all the ingenious men to meet us at every Town with their Talismans in their hands ready to shew us their skill and sport. We had not gone above two Leagues South∣ward,
<PB N="104" REF="131"/>
but we came to a Town called by the <HI>Sevarites Magmandi,</HI> where thirty Philoso∣phers met the King; and to welcome him, they had a Talisman ready to make a Louse grow in an instant as big as a Camel. I saw the beast, and admired how such things could be done by a man, and as they told me, that they did it by the natural causes alone, without the concurrence of any other thing. As soon as the Philosopher had turned the Louse into a Camel, he mounted upon it, and offered his service to <HI>Sevar∣minas</HI> to wait upon him in his Progress, which was accepted. And if I should say, that this strange Camel gallopped, or ra∣ther flew, as fast as any of our Dromeda∣ries, scarce any person will believe it: yet true it is, that this new-made creature led the way before us, and returned back with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the wing no signs of being weary: in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Provender the Philosopher had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> himself with a bottle of Spirits, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he would sometimes, as I took <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, pour into the Camels Ears, and-by that means kept the beast alive and vigorous. Another of these Philosophers had got a Flea in his hand, which, with an Image of Wax, he turned into a Dromedary, so like that which the King was upon, that I could
<PB N="105" REF="131"/>
not tell how to distinguish them. I saw the Flea which he held in a silken string, he shewed it to all our company, and before us, by an application of the Talismanical Fi∣gure, the Flea began to dilate it self into the body of a Camel, and out of the body the legs and ears and head broke out almost like a Snail when it goes to creep, or like a Tor∣toise. All this was done in less than a quarter of an hour. He also had a Saddle ready to ride along with us in the compa∣ny of the King and his Nobles. I confess, I took these two Learned <HI>Sevarites</HI> for Con∣jurers, if not for Devils in mens shape. When <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> perceived in our way, that <HI>Maurice</HI> whispered to me, he drew near to me, and assured me, that they could do more wonderful Feats than that by their great Art, and that what they had done, was done by the secret power of na∣tural causes, set on work by the influence of the Talisman. I told him, that I could wish, that we in our Country had the same skill and knowledge: but he answered, That such Mysteries are not fit but for men of the most refined Wits, and that no dull or vicious apprehensions can be capable of the sublime Notions that such men must have to act such Wonders, and to find out
<PB N="106" REF="132"/>
the way to make such strange Talismans. Another of these Philosophers, who stood within some golden Rails adjoyning to the High-way, had in his hand a naked Image of Wax, representing a young Girl, which Image he turned about his head, with some hard words which he uttered out of his mouth, and immediately there came to the place all the young Maidens within a cer∣tain distance, and threw off their garments with their modesty, in my judgment; but the religious <HI>Sevarites</HI> are not ashamed to behold what Nature teaches other men to cover. These Maidens leaped over the Rails about threescore in number, and began a most pleasant Dance upon the green grass before all our company, the Philosopher having appointed a Musician ready for that purpose, who played all the while upon his Instrument of Musick, ac∣cording to which these Maidens leaped and danced up and down, which gave <HI>Se∣varminas</HI> much sport and to all his Court; but when the Philosopher began to turn away, and cover the waxen Image, they took all their garments again, and departed with much satisfaction, because they had given some delight to their Prince, whom all the <HI>Sevarites</HI> reverence as they do a visi∣ble
<PB N="107" REF="132"/>
God; they are therefore very joyful, when they can do any thing to please and delight him. The rest of the Philosophers shewed every one in his turn what he was able to do. One held a Mouse by the tail in one hand, and his Talisman in the other, and threw the Mouse behind <HI>Sevarminas</HI> upon his Dromedary, which as soon as it was there, but a moment, it had the power to attract one of the most beautiful Vir∣gins, whom I saw straggling behind the King. This thing caused the whole com∣pany to burst out in laughter; for she was just putting on her Apparel with the rest of her Companions, when the Talisman tyed her hands and feet, and drew her on a sudden, so that she was seen to leap all naked through the midst of us behind the King, where she remained till the Philoso∣pher drew her back with the Talisman, and caused her to put on her cleaths and de∣part. Another of these Makers of Talis∣mans was blowing with a Pipe at the breech of a Cat, which swelled bigger than any Elephant: when therefore he saw his time, he turned the tail towards the company, and by a secret Talisman gave liberty to the wind to go softly out by the same hole where it was put in. The noise was so de∣lightful,
<PB N="108" REF="133"/>
that I never heard more variety and sweoter Musick in my days; for the Philosopher stroked the Cats back and belly, and as he pressed it harder or softer, the wind would go out and whistle all sorts of Tunes. The King himself and all the company desired the Learned man to come to Court as soon as he should re∣turn, and give them that sport, which they fancied very much. I looked upon the Cat, whether it was alive, and I saw that it was a natural Cat, much like the Civet-Cats; for besides the Musick, the Air was filled with such excellent and glorious smells, that we were all ravished and in a maze, how this could come to pass. All the rest shewed some trick or other, but for brevity sake I omit them, to give an account of our Journey. I cannot here describe the number of beautiful Fabricks, of Orchards full of all manner of Fruit∣trees, Gardens with all kind of Flowers, Herbs, and Plants, both delightful to the eye, and useful to the body. I cannot num∣ber all the other Rarities and Riches which this Country was full of, with the pleasant Chanels of Crystal-water, with the Bridges and Arches in our way, with the many Towns walled and open, most of precious
<PB N="109" REF="133"/>
Stones, and adorned with Gold and Silver, and Ivory, and all manner of Riches. If I should give a particular account, no per∣son can believe, unless he had been himself an Eye-witness of the things that we saw then in our Journey. We went through <HI>Parascali,</HI> a good Town, where the River <HI>Omer</HI> joyns with <HI>Rocara.</HI> The Inhabitants were so civil, that they met the King with rich Tables of Gold, covered all over with Dishes of Sweet-meats, of a <HI>China</HI> substance and make. Every Cavaliero had liberty to take what pleased him best. Whiles we stayed there, some Philosophers stood in our way to give us some of the former sports: at last he that was mounted upon his Camel, made of a Louse, caused two great wings to grow out at the back, by the means of a Talisman, which he had brought with him in his hand. As soon as they were perfected, the Camel flew up to the top of the great Steeple of the Tem∣ple of <HI>Parascali,</HI> where it stood a while with the Philosopher on its back: at last it returned to us again without any harm either to the beast or the man. The next Town was <HI>Moramir,</HI> the third <HI>Storax,</HI> the fourth <HI>Bolaciro,</HI> the fifth <HI>Memrak,</HI> the sixth <HI>Burino,</HI> where we stopt to take a Dinner
<PB N="110" REF="134"/>
prepared for us. I must not forget to mention certain Images that stood in the High-way, at the entring in of the Town; there were two chief, a young Maid of Alabaster, and a Man of white Marble. The Philosophers Camel would not go beyond them, till he began to prick the beast for∣ward with a Talisman. If it had not been for this accident, I should not have taken so much notice of them, nor inquired after the cause of their being there. <HI>Zidi Para∣bas</HI> gave me full satisfaction, and told me, that they were the Images of two unfortu∣nate Lovers of the Town of <HI>Burino,</HI> who had been constant to one another, till death separated them, their love and constant affection caused their deaths: For it hap∣pened, that their Parents would not con¦sent to their conjunction, which they dared not agree to without their leave, and the publick Solemnity, for fear of the disgrace which usually, as a consequence, attends upon such kind of amorous indiscretions in the Country of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> They were therefore resolved to love one another ten∣derly, and to refuse all other Matches and Proffers. They had been often tempted with other Proposals, and with the Beauty and Riches of other Parties; but <HI>Ziricus</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="134"/>
and <HI>Malimna,</HI> so were they named by <HI>Zidi Parabas,</HI> flighted all things but the sight and company of one another, which they would endeavour to injoy by stealth, be∣cause they were narrowly watched by their jealous Parents, who by no means would suffer them to come near together with their good will. Their love by this re∣straint increased more and more, and their mutual affection found many Tricks and Arts to meet together in spight of their Parents watchfulness. They found many back doors and secret corners, to which their extraordinary Sympathy brought them together: yet they would not be per∣swaded to violate the Law of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> This Love continued near forty years with a constancy worthy to be chronicled; yet their Parents would never consent to their Marriage. At last when they saw, that neither their affection, nor their resolution never to change could prevail upon their cruel Parents, and their invincible obstina∣cy, they consulted betwixt themselves to depart together out of the Kingdom, and to marry in some other Land. Whiles they were in this resolution, they knew not which way to go, because the passages were narrowly guarded. At a meeting there∣fore,
<PB N="112" REF="135"/>
an old crafty Devil appears to them in the likeness of a man, and offers them his service to assist them over the Seas. They agreed for a price to be transported to an Island not inhabited, upon the Pacifick Sea, with some Tools, and grain for their maintenance. The Devil, in the shape of a <HI>Sevarite,</HI> promised to bring them a Ship in the dead time of the night to the great River of <HI>Rocara;</HI> for they thought he had been some Sea-man or Ship-master. The time and place of departing was appointed. The young Couple, according to their in∣gagement, came to the place a little before the evening; and when they saw that the Devil was rough to them, and had cloven feet, they began to suspect, yet they were so passionate for one another, and there∣fore so blind, that the woman first ventured her self in the Arms of the Devil to be car∣ried through the water to the Ship, which they saw in the River: the young man in∣tending to follow next; but the wicked Devil, instead of conveying the young Vir∣gin safe aboard, plunged and held her un∣der water till she was stifled and dead, and that in sight of her Sweet-heart, who as soon as he heard her begin to shriek, and saw what was practising against her life
<PB N="113" REF="135"/>
and his, it is not to be imagined what torments and trouble of mind he was in, sometimes with his Sword in his hand he ran into the water up to the neck, again he would return up to the bank, to see whe∣ther his dearly Beloved was yet alive, again he would run into the River, till at last, when he perceived the wickedness of the counterfeit Devil, he cast himself cespe∣rately into the River; and though he had never any skill to swim, his love for his Beloved, for whom he had a more tender affection than for his own soul, made him venture, and found a means to get as far as the body of his murdered Darling, which he brought ashore, and seeing no sign of life, he killed himself, and fell upon her body. In remembrance of this Tragedy the Town hath dedicated these two Images, the one to <HI>Ziricus,</HI> and the other to <HI>Ma∣limna,</HI> with a great many lesser Images of young Men and Maidens, that are all weep∣ing for the misfortune of these two constant Lovers. This story <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> told me, whiles the Dinner was bringing in to the great Hall of Ivory, where the King <HI>Sevar∣minas</HI> was to dine with all his Court. When we were sate down, we had all things need∣ful presented before us, with a Concert of
<PB N="114" REF="136"/>
Musick mingled with rare Voices of some Virgins of the City. After this, a Philoso∣pher brought in a Silver Chain, a great white Rat, about the bigness of a good Rabbet, which leaped upon the Table near <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and looked wishfully upon him when he was eating; but when the Rat saw that the King said nothing, the Rat reached forth its paw or foot, and took some of the meat. The King was not a little surprised with the Rats boldness: How now! said he, did your Master teach you this? The Philosopher by the Talisma∣nical Art could make it speak what he list∣ed, for he could govern the tongue of the little creature in that manner, that what was in his mind the beast would speak: By your leave, my Lord, quoth the Rat to the King, I am hungry. The Rats speech sur∣prised the King, and all the company left their meat to hear the discourse between the King and the Rat; for the Philosopher told his Majesty, That it would give him any answer that he would desire. They not knowing from whence it proceeded no more than we, they stood to see what the Rat would say: the Rat was neither asha∣med, nor afraid of the company, but went from one dish to another to taste which was
<PB N="115" REF="136"/>
the best; it met with an Ostrich-Pye, on which it fell aboard without any manners: the King bid it be gone, I'le fill my belly first, answered the Rat, now I am here. <HI>King,</HI> I command thee to be gone. <HI>Rat,</HI> I love this company too well to run away in haste. <HI>King,</HI> Make haste. <HI>Rat,</HI> We must do nothing rashly. <HI>King,</HI> Thou wilt eat all. <HI>Rat,</HI> There is enough in the Land for you and me too. <HI>King,</HI> Who tutored thee? <HI>Rat,</HI> My Master. Several other discourses past between <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and this artificial creature, which was made to speak, not by its own understanding, but by that of the Philosopher only; by the Ta∣lismanical Art he could make use of the organ and tongue of the Rat to speak what was according to his mind. This was a cu∣rious passage, and gave the whole company great delight. The Philosopher told <HI>Sevar∣minas,</HI> That he could make any beast, that was tame, to speak in that manner, and say any thing. We found this to be too true; for afterwards another Learned man had taught a Camel, another an Ass, another a Dromedary, another a tame Lion to say any thing, with as much reason, as if they had been rational creatures, whereas it was but the organ of their tongue that was
<PB N="116" REF="137"/>
made use of by the strong power of a Ta∣lisman to turn which way, and articulate whatsoever the Author of the Talisman pleased. We stayed not long in the place; but as soon as we had all dined, and refreshed our selves, we mounted upon our Drome∣daries, and went on in our Journey. The Louse, Camel, and the Flea turned into a Dromedary, going with us in our company, we passed by a curious Town that stood up∣on an Hill, which had a plentiful stream of water rising from the top, and falling from a steep place upon a Diamant Rock, and then incompassed the Hill round with a deep Chanel, over which there was a cu∣rious Bridge of precious Stones, with Silver Globes on the top, and the sides of the Walls with a most beautiful Arch, the most regularly built that I ever knew. The Towns name is <HI>Tiftani,</HI> commanded by a Prince, the most considerable of all the Sub∣jects of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> he came out to meet us with a beautiful Guard of young Gallants, all cloathed in Cloth of Silver. The Prin∣cess also came to the entring in of the Town with a beautiful Attendance of Ladies in their rich Attire covered over with Pearls, and the richest and most precious Stones. They made a low obeisance to King <HI>Se∣varminas,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="137"/>
and offered him the Keys of their City, which he returned to the Prince <HI>Mu∣raski:</HI> that was the name of the Prince, who was young, about the age of thirty years. We passed through the streets through the Acclamations and Applauses of all the Common people, that are the happiest in the World in all respects; for they pay but little or no Tribute, and have all things in such abundance, glory, and plenty, that there is no want nor complaints in all the Land, the poorest <HI>Sevarite</HI> hath enough, and the richest can have no more than they use, for all the rest is superfluous. The next Town was <HI>Tiptanicar,</HI> where upon an high Tower stood a Talisman of Gold, for what intent I could never learn. We went through <HI>Muramni, Borascot, Malavisi,</HI> and several other good walled Towns in our way. We lodged that night in one of the Kings Palaces, situate in a little Lake, a∣bout ten miles in compass, in an Island that stands in the middle. Several Boats and Vessels waited for us to convey us and our Dromedaries over to the Island. This place is one of the most pleasant abodes of the World. Here we stop'd above a fortnight, which we spent sometimes in fishing, some∣times in hunting, walking about, and admi∣ring
<PB N="118" REF="138"/>
the wonderful things that appeared every where. Sometimes the Kings Philoso∣phers together with the Musicians, would make us such good sport, that we were never weary, we could have spent the days and the nights in seeing such sports and pass∣times. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> all this while sent for me often, with <HI>De Nuits</HI> and <HI>Maurice,</HI> to discourse with us, and inform himself con∣cerning the Affairs, Commodities, and Conveniencies of our Country: in which particulars I always gave him such answers as would increase his desire to entertain a Trade and Correspondency with our Na∣tion, and the other People of <HI>Europe.</HI> When we had lived here in this Castle, and plea∣sant Island called the Isle of Foxes, and in the <HI>Sevarites</HI> Language <HI>Cristako,</HI> we set for∣ward for another place called the Mount <HI>Timpani,</HI> where the Kings of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> have another House of Pleasure: it is about an hundred Leagues distant towards the Southwest from <HI>Cristako.</HI> We passed through many Woods, Vallies, and an open Coun∣try in our way to it, and had the sight of several rare Towns, <HI>Seravi, Puteoli, Nanti, Quarok, Runtour,</HI> and several others no less rich and beautiful than the former. I cannot forget to mention a rare Invention which I
<PB N="119" REF="138"/>
saw at <HI>Seravi.</HI> There is a large River about two miles distant from the Town, which stands upon a Hill without any water. The ingenious <HI>Sevarites</HI> therefore have found an Art to convey this great River in an artifi∣cial Chanel, built and supported upon an Arch of hard Diamant stone, above two miles from one Hill to the other, over a deep Valley, into which the River did run before; but because the Valley was not so wholesom an Air as the top of the Moun∣tain, they have built there their houses, and been at the trouble to make for the River an artificial Chanel, so deep, that Boats of an hundred Tun can sail up and down in the driest time of Summer; for there is scarce any mud or dirt in the Chanel over the Valley: the water is as clear as Cry∣stal.</P>
<P>In another Town called <HI>Runtour,</HI> there was a company of Apes met us at the entry in of the Town: they were so bold, that they leapt upon the backs of our Drome∣daries, and put us in no little danger to be cast to the ground. But one of our Philo∣sophers pulled out of his pocket a strange Talisman, of a yellow colour, through which there was a hole which he clapt to his lips, and whistled away the Apes. They
<PB N="120" REF="139"/>
were not gone ten paces from us, but they all fell down dead with the venemous Spi∣rits which this Talisman conveyed to them without hurting any creature else; for you must know, that what is a poyson to one creature, is not so to another, and these skill∣ful men so well read in the secret Mysteries of Nature, can direct their operations which way they please, at a distance as well as near at hand. The King of the <HI>Seva∣rites</HI> hath always one or more of these Phi∣losophers to accompany him when he goes into the Country, for fear any accident might happen to his Person or Retinue.</P>
<P>We found a plentiful Dinner prepared for us at <HI>Nanti,</HI> where the Ladies of the Town waited upon <HI>Sevarminas</HI> at the Ta∣ble, and came to the rest of his Company to offer their Services. The Governors name was <HI>Forabo,</HI> an old grave Signior near fourscore years of age, he had twenty Sons comely and proper young men, with five Daughters, all by one Woman, whose name was <HI>Pluralis:</HI> she was then a grave Matron of a beautiful and grave countenance, her Daughters young Ladies followed her when she came to salute <HI>Sevarminas</HI> and his Lords. We made no long stay in this place, but marched next to the Mount <HI>Timpani,</HI> but
<PB N="121" REF="139"/>
could not get thither till the next day at night; we lodged therefore in the Town of <HI>Durambi,</HI> and the next day early in the morning we set forward in our Journey to mount <HI>Timpani,</HI> where we arrived about Sun-set. There happened nothing in this days riding remarkable, only <HI>Maurices</HI> Dromedary being offended that he had kicked her with his heel, cast him to the ground, and bruised his thigh and arm; but the Kings Physician applying an Herb called <HI>Muroz,</HI> which he found in the fields hard by, cured the wound, eased him pre∣sently of his pain, so that he never com∣plained afterwards. The nature of these creatures is such, that they must be gently dealt withal, otherwise they become fu∣rious and mad: but if the Rider handles them softly, there is no beast so gentle, so easie, and useful.</P>
<P>Mount <HI>Timpani</HI> is a pleasant Hill crown∣ed on the top with all manner of the most beautiful Trees in Nature, bearing all sorts of Fruits. In the midst is the Kings Palace moted round. The water runs from six great Fountains, which are on the top of the Hill, unto which there is an easie ascent on the side of the Hill: about half a mile from the Castle is a Town of the same
<PB N="122" REF="140"/>
name, very glorious to the eye when the Sun shines. The Castle or the Kings Pa∣lace is about a mile in circumference, with strong Walls of clear stones, of a white and reddish colour, such as I never saw the like before. It was well furnished with all manner of Houshold-stuff, the richest that I ever beheld: the large and spacious Rooms, Chambers, and Halls, and Galle∣ries, with their Ornaments, were not to be numbered. At our first arrival, the Governor of the Town, with the chief In∣habitants, came to wait upon their King, who shewed them a great deal of respect as belonged to his loving Subjects. All this while he had concealed the cause of his Journey to that place, and would not let any person, not his own Son, nor any of his Privy Counsellors understand any thing of it, till three or four days after our arrival; for it becomes a great Prince, who intends to act securely in weighty matters, not to let any man, not his greatest Friends, know his intentions to the full. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> ha∣ving here a great business to put in execu∣tion, which concerned nothing less than the safety and peace of his Empire, he concealed it from all the world, and gave out, that he would make this Progress for
<PB N="123" REF="140"/>
his pastime and for his health. The Go∣vernors name was <HI>Smuriamnas,</HI> a man of an ancient Family, lineally descended from the great <HI>Sevarias,</HI> but young and very ambitious, and no less proud and haughty amongst his Equals, which caused his Peo∣ple not to affect him so much as otherwise they would have done. At our arrival he came to pay his Homage and Respects to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> his Prince, and the next day invited him and all the Court to a costly and sumptuous Banquet. I and my Com∣panions, together with <HI>Sermodas</HI> and <HI>Zidi Parabas,</HI> were lodged in a spacious Cham∣ber, where were twenty Beds of Ivory and Gold, with curious Curtains of Silk em∣broidered with Gold, with the Walls hung with Pictures, very well and artificially drawn. After Supper we went to take our leaves of King <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and were immediately conducted to our Chamber, where we rested sweetly, till the next mor∣ning the noise of the Trumpets, Bag-pipes, Flutes, Viols, and Violins, Harps, Guitars, and all manner of Musick played at the Kings rising. This pleasant and ravishing Harmony awakened us and our Chamber∣fellows, and obliged us to put on our Ap∣parel. We walked about the Chamber a
<PB N="124" REF="141"/>
while, discoursing of the strange passages of our Journey, when in came a Messenger from the King to call us to him. He had an intent to walk about his Parks, and view the Town before Dinner. He was therefore willing, that we Strangers might go along with him, not only for our satis∣faction, but also to shew his People men of foreign Nations come to adore and wor∣ship him. The Parks were all walled round with many Lakes, Ponds, Rivers, and Streams of Water full of all manner of wild and tame Fowl, with all sorts of Beasts, Deer of all kinds, Rabbets, Hares, and a sort of Creature named <HI>Buffoli,</HI> which hath no joynts in its fore-legs, and never∣theless runs as swift as any other beast. In the Parks we had the sight of many Trees and Woods, where the Birds and wild Fowl and Beasts use to shelter themselves. After this Walk we marched into the Town, all our Company, where the Governor at the entrance received us with his Family; but the Citizens, with the chief men, stood at a distance, crying out, men, women, and children in their Language, <HI>Marabi, Ma∣rabi, Marabi,</HI> that is, Justice, Justice, Ju∣stice. I saw at this sudden cry the Gover∣nors countenance change: he nevertheless
<PB N="125" REF="141"/>
drew near to <HI>Sevarminas</HI> with all the re∣spect imaginable; but he received him with a setled countenance, and asked what the people meant by their <HI>Marabi.</HI> Before he had time to answer, one of the chief of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> stept forward, followed by all the rest. They all fell upon their knees, and bowing to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> they humbly intreated him, that he would listen to and pity their grievance. What is the matter? answered he. <Q>One of them stood up, and in the Governors presence spoke to him in this manner: Most Noble and ever Glo∣rious Monarch, we your Subjects are heartily glad to see you amongst us, we have longed a great while to have you here to free us from an intolerable burden. Prince <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> our Governor forget∣ting the blessed Rules of our great <HI>Seva∣rias,</HI> oppresseth us contrary to all Law and Justice, and hath spilled the innocent blood of many of our friends, whose Souls will not suffer us to sleep in quiet, till their deaths be revenged. We have often admonished him to recal him from his perverse and wicked practices; but to all our admonitions he hath returned no∣thing but curses and blows without mer∣cy: so that for these many years we have
<PB N="126" REF="142"/>
lived as so many slaves; and unless your glorious Majesty will relieve us, we must forsake him and his Principality, and seek our remedy in a retreat far from him. But we expect from your Justice and Goodness that relief which you have af∣forded to many of your poor Subjects in such like cases.</Q> This Speech made <HI>Smu∣riamnas</HI> faint away, so that he fell down as dead before the whole company; but <HI>Se∣varminas</HI> caused him to be taken up, and his Physician to take care of him. <HI>Sevar∣minas</HI> expected this complaint before he heard it. His coming was to remove and punish <HI>Smuriamnas,</HI> and place in his stead his eldest Son <HI>Suricolis,</HI> a young Man of an excellent beauty, who waited upon him from his youth. As soon as he heard the peoples grievance, he assured them, that he would severely punish him according to Law, and cause them to receive satisfacti∣on, wishing them all to depart home with this assurance, without noise or tumult, and to be ready when his Judges should be rea∣dy to examine their Cause, to bring in their Allegations and Proofs against <HI>Smu∣riamnas.</HI> In the mean while <HI>Sevarminas</HI> would not go to the Palace of <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> as he was invited, nor to the Town Hall,
<PB N="127" REF="142"/>
where the Chief of the Town promised to bring him a Dinner; but he returned with all his Train to the Castle, where Dinner was ready for us. He gave Order, that <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> should be kept in a close Pri∣son, joyning to the place of Judicature, till the next day; for then he intended, with the Advice of his Court, to punish him ac∣cording to the Laws of the Land; for it seems he had been guilty of Murder, and Violence, and Oppression, and had not ob∣served the sacred Laws of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> in his Jurisdiction. The next day we went down into the Town to accompany <HI>Sevar∣minas,</HI> who sate down upon an high Throne prepared for him, under a Canopy of Gold, embroidered; round about sate and stood his religious Counsellors and Judges. When it was noised about the Town, that <HI>Sevar∣minas</HI> was sate in his Judgment-seat, for it was not above nine of the clock in the morning, the whole Town came to the place, with intention to accuse <HI>Smuriamnas,</HI> who was brought before the King with his hands tied behind his back. Presently there came a Widow with four young Infants weeping, because <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> had killed her Husband in his anger, for no other cause, but because he would not comply
<PB N="128" REF="143"/>
with his irregular commands. She pro∣ved it against him by no less than ten Wit∣nesses, who were there present upon the place. Another stept up and said, That he had killed his Brother, producing suffi∣cient Witnesses that saw the Murder. Ano∣ther complained of the destroying of his Friend privately: others came forth to de∣clare how <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> had oppressed them with cruel Exactions. The King desired no other proof of these Accusations, but the view of his body without a disguise, cove∣ring, or paint: For, as I said before, as soon as men amongst the <HI>Sevarites</HI> have com∣mitted any wickedness, there is immedi∣ately an alteration upon the body and skin of the Offendor, that declares what he hath done. That this might not appear, <HI>Smu∣riamnas</HI> had made use of the Talismanical Art and of Painting, by the one to keep down all tumors and rising in his face and hands, and by the other to cover all ugly colours that were upon his skin. There∣fore the King commanded him to be stript naked, and carried into a Bath, and there to be rub'd and washed, which accord∣ingly was done. When he was brought back, I never saw such a disfigured Crea∣ture, his arms were as black as pitch, his
<PB N="129" REF="143"/>
hands all gore blood, his face as green as grass, his legs as yellow as saffron, on his back and legs appeared two Tumors about the bigness of Walnuts. When he appear∣ed so odious to the company, the King passed his Sentence upon him, to the great joy of the Inhabitants: and because blood requires blood, and no other Crime is to be punished with death but Murder amongst the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> the King delivered him to the will of the aggrieved parties to put him to death. They took him first and whip∣ped him, till his body was full of scars and wounds, which they anointed with honey, and then tyed him upon an high place in the middle of their Town with his face upwards. As soon as he was there, a Swarm of Wasps and Bees flew about him, with some Vulturs and Eagles, which devoured him in two days: so that there was no∣thing remaining of his body but the bones. The King condescended to this exemplary punishment, the rather, because <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> had a design to alter the Government of the <HI>Sevarites,</HI> and revolt from his obedi∣ence: for that purpose he had endeavou∣red to perswade some other petty Princes to joyn with him against their Soveraign King <HI>Sevarminas.</HI> Yet he was so gracious
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>
to call his Son in the prefence of all the Chief men of the Town, and to restore him to his Fathers Estate and Goods, without the least diminution of any thing. He gave him this admonition in the prefence of a multitude of people: <HI>Suricolis,</HI> said the King, thou hast seen a severe Example of Justice upon thy Father for abusing his Power and Authority, I might make that use of his Crime, to deprive all his Family from any such opportunity of doing a mis∣chief; but I consider, that thy Religious inclinations have often caused thee to dis∣allow thy Fathers proceedings, and to blame him for the liberty he took contrary to Justice and Law. I consider, that thou art as likely to do as much good as <HI>Smuri∣amnas</HI> hath done mischief. I restore thee not only to thy Fathers Estate, but like∣wise to his Authority and Command. Take heed that thou followest not thy Fathers Example: let not thy Glory puff thee up with pride, nor thy Power cause thee to act contrary to Reason and Law: remem∣ber that there is a punishment for evil doers, as there are rewards for the just: behave thy self with that discretion and moderation, that thou mayst have the com∣mendation rather than the condemnation
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
of thy Country-men, that thou mayst de∣serve well from me and them. This Cle∣mency and Justice made <HI>Sevarminas</HI> to be praised in all parts amongst the <HI>Sevarites;</HI> for thereby all persons were obliged, and thereby secured from such like violences, and the noble Family of <HI>Smuriamnas</HI> con∣tinued in its Splendour and Glory, only a rotten Member was taken out of the way for the Publick good.</P>
<P>After this piece of Justice, we remained there about a month, which <HI>Sevarminas</HI> spent in regulating all those things-that were amiss in the Government of <HI>Smuri∣amnas</HI> through his ill Management of Af∣fairs. Afterwards he left there the new Governor <HI>Suricolis</HI> to do Justice in his ab∣sence, commanding him to be impartial in all his publick Actions, and to abstain from the Vices unto which his Father was inclinable, which cast him into the dange∣rous precipice of destruction.</P>
<P>We departed from thence with the bles∣sings and good wishes of all the Inhabitants, and in three days we returned to <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> where our coming was expected with much impatience; for in the Kings absence that City could not be governed well by any other person. Some disorders therefore had
<PB N="132" REF="145"/>
happened, which the Viceroy could not pa∣cifie without the Kings Authority and Pre∣sence. The whole City met us at two miles from the place, and in a most beautiful order marched along with us into <HI>Sevarinde.</HI></P>
<P>I continued in the City about half a year, which I spent in inquiring after the Conveniencies of the Country, the Sea-Ports, the Commodities and Riches that it brings forth, that I might give that infor∣mation to my Country-men, which might benefit them in future Ages after my re∣turn to my own Country; for we were in expectation of a Ship from <HI>Batavia,</HI> whi∣ther we had again sent some of our men with a Vessel, which we had recovered a∣mongst the <HI>Sporvi,</HI> to desire the Governor of <HI>Batavia</HI> to send a Ship that might con∣vey away our Goods and persons.</P>
<P>But whiles I stayed there, a young Lady of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> who had lost her Husband by death, fell in love with <HI>Maurice,</HI> and often treated us very nobly in her house. <HI>Man¦rice</HI> was no <HI>Sevarite,</HI> and could not refrain from some amorous embrances, which the Lady gladly accepted of; for it was not lawful by the Law of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> to match with any other generation. But to cover their actions, the Lady had made use of the
<PB N="133" REF="145"/>
skill of the Philosophers to keep down the Tumors in her skin and body, and to paint <HI>Maurices</HI> face and hands, which hindered their secret correspondency from being known abroad. I must needs confess, that <HI>Maurices</HI> happiness caused me to look a∣broad, and see whether I could meet with the same Fortune: For that purpose I walk∣ed about the City often, early and late, to see what I should by chance meet with. About a month before our departure from <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> a young Gentlewoman, who had Father and Mother, and never knew a man, invited me into a Garden, where she was alone, in the Spanish Tongue. I was glad of this opportunity, we walked there∣fore several turns together, talking of di∣vers matters: at last she opened her mind to me in this manner. Sir, I understand by your countenance, that you are a Stran∣ger, our King <HI>Sevarminas</HI> hath a great esteem for you, as well as my Father and Mother: we have often talked of you and your religious behaviour since your coming into our Country; we shall therefore be glad to be acquainted with you; for in my Fathers name I will bid you welcome, and will assure you, that he will give you a kind reception; for he is a Merchant, and
<PB N="134" REF="146"/>
conveys Commodities from City to City amongst the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> Sir, modesty will not give me leave to tell you more of my mind; but when we shall be better ac∣quainted, I hope—With these words she broke off with a modest blush upon her Cheeks. The young Woman was most beautiful, and was cloathed in white Silk, with a Girdle of pure Gold, all beset with precious Stones about her middle. She in∣quired whether I were not married in my own Country, I assured her, that I was not: upon this, she confessed her amorous in∣clinations for me, but withal told me, that every thing must be performed in due time, and that she would not precipitate the bu∣siness, but wished me to ask her Fathers consent, assuring me, that she would wil∣lingly leave all to live and dye with a man of that sweet temper and disposition that I was of. Her loving Complements I an∣swered with Caresses, and assured her, that I should think my self happy in her injoy∣ment. We spent some time together to begin our acquaintance, and to inform our¦selves of one anothers Conditions and Estate; but the night obliged me to leave her for that time, and return to my Lodg∣ings. When I gave <HI>Maurice</HI> an account
<PB N="135" REF="146"/>
of all particulars, he advised me not to neglect the offer, but to visit her in her Fa∣thers house; for himself and his Lady, he told me, that he was resolved to carry her with him to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where he intended to live and dye with her: and though Women amongst the <HI>Sevarites</HI> are forbidden Goods, and that it is not lawful to transport them to other Countries, he was perswaded by the means of friends with <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> to get that liberty and priviledge, which was never granted to any before. This dis∣course and his hopes made me conceive the same. I went therefore often to see the young Lady, who entertained me and my Companions very courteously, as well as her Father and Mother. After several Visits, I opened the matter to the Parents in their Daughters absence; they made some diffi∣culty, because of the Laws of the Country, and my inclinations to return into my own Country. But when I told them, that we had Plantations in <HI>Batavia,</HI> not far from thence, and that I would live and dye with her there, they began to yield to my re∣quest, in case <HI>Sevarminas</HI> would dispense with the Law of the Land, and suffer me to carry her away. This I told them, that I would endeavour to obtain from his good∣ness.
<PB N="136" REF="147"/>
I cannot give an exact account of all our pleasant meetings, of the rare things she discovered to me, of the delightful Walks, and other things which pass all imagination. But certainly her company and sweet Conversation made me spend my time with great contentment. In or∣der to our Marriage, when the Portion was agreed upon, I caused <HI>Zidi Parabas</HI> and <HI>Ziribabdas,</HI> my two intimate Friends, to open the business to King <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> that we might have his approbation and consent to that which was not agreeable with the ancient Laws of the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> But in re∣gard we had behaved our selves so religi∣ously since our being in the Country, he thought it no disgrace to grant us more liberty than ordinary. After this business had been debated in his Privy Council, it was resolved that this course should be ta∣ken to oblige us the more, and invite our Country men to trade with his People. Therefore I had a leave to marry publickly my young Mistress, and <HI>Maùrice</HI> also had a Dispensation to take to Wife his courteous Lady. When all these things were agreed upon, the day was appointed, for both King <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> and all the Nobles of his Court, assisted at the Solemnity, and
<PB N="137" REF="147"/>
brought us to his Royal Palace, where he bestowed upon us most rich and glorious Gifts, and entertained our new and young Wives with a sumptuous Feast, at which they had the Honour to sit next the Queen. The Ceremony of Marriage was perform∣ed in the great Temple of <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> by breaking of bread, and joyning of hands, with many Prayers and Blessings from their Priests. It was concluded with a Dance and Musick, where all the young Ladies of the Court shewed their acti∣vity.</P>
<P>Before the Marriage was concluded, a Ship was arrived amongst the <HI>Sporvi</HI> from <HI>Batavia,</HI> where <HI>Meen Heer van Plumerick</HI> commanded in Chief. As soon as we had news of this Ship, we went and gave an account of its arrival to <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> who desired us to send for the Captain <HI>Van Plu∣merick,</HI> and promised, that then we should have liberty to depart along with him, with our Wives, and such things as belong∣ed to us, to <HI>Batavia,</HI> or whither we had a mind to go. We thanked him for his great and extraordinary Civilities, and told him, that we would spread his Fame all over the World. According to this Order, <HI>Sermodas</HI> was sent back to <HI>Sporunde,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="148"/>
to fetch Captain <HI>Van Plumerick,</HI> whose Ship had Orders to get into the River of <HI>Rocara.</HI> He came with some kind of re∣luctancy, not knowing the Civilities and good Entertainment that we had found amongst the <HI>Sevarites.</HI> But when he was arrived, and saw the Riches and Happiness of the People and Country, and found them, as well as we, to be men of Faith, good Behaviour, and Honesty, he was not sorry for his condescension to this request. After his arrival to <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> we remained there two months, which we spent in mer∣ry Sports, Feasts, Banquets, Hunting, Hawking, and all manner of Delights, ac∣cording to the custom of that glorious Court. <HI>Sevarminas</HI> was well pleased with the Conversation of <HI>Van Plumerick;</HI> for he was a gallant Man, and knew so well how to hit the humor of <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> that the King gave him very rich Presents. His Ship had Orders to draw near to the Bor∣ders of the <HI>Sevarites</HI> into the River <HI>Rocara,</HI> because we might more conveniently load our Goods, and because <HI>Sevarminas</HI> had a great desire to go on board, and see the manner and fashions of our Ships of War, and the great Guns that were on board. To comply with his desire, we all went to
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
the banks of the River <HI>Rocara,</HI> where the Ship rode at an Anchor, trimmed and flou∣rishing with Garlands and Pendents of all colours. <HI>Sevarminas,</HI> accompanied by all his Court, was carried in the Captains Pinnace that waited for him, with several other Boats: when he was aboard, the Cannon and Trumpets bid him welcome. The Captain presented him with some Ra∣rities, which they have not in that Country. He gave him a Watch, a Clock, Guns of an extraordinary make, with many other things of <HI>Europe.</HI> After a Banquet in the great Cabin of the Ship, he returned to the shore, very well satisfied with his En∣tertainment. He desired one or two of our great Guns; for he intended to have some cast of Silver, because he had no Brass nor Bell-metal in all his Country.</P>
<P>We returned with him to <HI>Sevarinde,</HI> and then taking our farewel of all our Friends and Relations, we carried away our Goods, and shipped them aboard. <HI>Van Plumericks</HI> Ship, with our Wives, and all our Compa∣ny, set sail towards <HI>Batavia;</HI> but a storm, or rather a Hurricane at Sea, had a most driven us back again on the shore. We escaped narrowly by the great skill of the Mariners, and the watchfulness and vigi∣lancy
<PB REF="149"/>
of the Captain: so that in six days, or thereabouts, after the storm, we had sight of a Cape in <HI>Batavia,</HI> where we land∣ed, to the great joy of all our Country-men, who were desirous to see the new Country that we had discovered, when we shewed them our Riches and Jewels, and gave them an account of the excellent People that inhabit there.</P>
