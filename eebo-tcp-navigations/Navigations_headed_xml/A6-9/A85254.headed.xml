<HEAD>HIND'S RAMBLE, OR, The Description of his man∣ner and course of life. WHEREIN, Is related the several Roberies He hath committed in <HI>England,</HI> and the Escapes he hath made upon several occasions.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>1. <HI>How</HI> Hind <HI>first learnt his Art, under one Bishop</HI> Allen.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LL men if they learn an Art serve some time to it, as <HI>Hind</HI> did to one <HI>Allen,</HI> who named himself, <HI>Lord Bishop of Durham,</HI> or of some other place, as his business lay.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P>This <HI>Allen</HI> was once a Trades∣man in <HI>London,</HI> but trading failing, sold his stock to set up another trade: so he bought a Coach and four Hor∣ses, and had six men to wait on him in Livery Cloaks, with a Gentleman Usher: He habited himself in a Ruff, a square Cap, Lawn Sleeves, and his long Gown: So riding in this State they did many Robberies undiscove∣red; for when any Gentleman Rod their way, they would leave their Cloaks in the Coach, and do a Rob∣bery, and then put their Booty into the Coach, and get their Livery Cloaks on their backs; if any hue and cry came after them, they would never suspect any of the Bishops men: so when they came to any Inn, the Bishop was honoured, as much as a man of his quality, for his Gentle∣man Usher stood bear all the while he was at dinner or supper. But this did not hold long, for they were discovered by some words; but ha∣ving
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>notice there of, they went far from the place, after they were known or discovered: And now they plot∣ted to get rid of their Coach, for they were afraid that would betray them: whereupon they begun their plot; and as they rid along the Downs, they saw a handsome old Shepherd to whom they said old man, <HI>If you please to be merry to night with us, you shall do as we do;</HI> so the old man or as willing to go with them: <HI>Allon</HI> told him, <HI>That he would make him L. Bishop for that night:</HI> So they put on the Bishops habit on the Shepherd, and it did become him very well then they instru∣cted him how to behave himself: So they came to the Inn, where in great pomp they supped: Supper being ended, the Bishops servants went to have their Lord to bed: he being in bed they came down, and told the Host, that their Lord was faln very sick, and that he desired a Doctor;
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>so they enquired for a Doctor, but there was none in 7. miles: then they forged letters that all the men were sent with spare horses to fetch friends, some to see their Lord, and som for the Doctor: that they left no servants to wait on the Bishop. They had also charged the shepherd not to knock till they came to him the next day; and they caused the people of the house not to go to their Lord till he knock'd for them, and then to carry him a <HI>Caudle:</HI> So they con∣veyed away their Bishops Robes, and left the Shepherds Coat by his bedside: so these Lads bid farwel to their Shepheard and their Coach: but about 10 of the clock in the mor∣ning the Shepheard awaked, as out of a <HI>dream,</HI> and knocked for the people, who brought him up a <HI>Caudle;</HI> he asked where were all his men; who answered that some were gone for a Doctor, and some for his friends; he bid the servant go down for his Ma∣ster;
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>the servant well eying the Shepherd, said to his Master; Sir, <HI>The Bishop has a Canvas shirt on as black as the Devil; and there is a pair of shooes stands by the Bed, as full of hob-nailes, as the skie is full of stars; and there lies a threedbare coat on the bed, that is fit for nothing but to make shoo clouts;</HI> so the host went up to see his guest, which by this time had drest himself in his own habit; who when he saw his host, said, <HI>Friend, I have been robbed to night of mine ho∣nour; but they left me mine own cloaths:</HI> whereat the host began to laugh; and say unto the Shepherd: my Lord, <HI>If you please to buy you two Coach Horses, I will lend you a Coach and Harness to carry your honour to the sheepfold:</HI> So the Shepherd related all the story to the host; and left them his Coach for the reckoning, and bid them adieu.</P>

<HEAD>2. <HI>How Bishop</HI> Allen <HI>was afterward taken and hang'd at</HI> Tiburn, <HI>and</HI> Hand <HI>escaped.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BISHOP <HI>Allen</HI> afterwards was taken neer <HI>London,</HI> with more of his Company, who were all hang'd at <HI>Tiburn; Hind</HI> onely escaped to set up his Masters trade, and no doubt but if he were taken, he would follow his Masters steps <HI>so far as Ti∣burn. Hind</HI> being in the company, escaped by leaving his horse in the stable, and trusting to his own heels, fled for his life; but now he walks on foot, having neither a horse nor money to buy one, but he resolves to get both, or to lose his head-peece.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>3. <HI>How</HI> Hind <HI>Robb'd a Gentleman, and furnished himself with a Horse, Money, and Cloaths.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HIND</HI> having lost his horse, whereby his trade fail'd, was resolved to get one, or to follow the trade on foot, and for to colour his knavery, put himself into the habit of a Shepherd, with a pike staff of seven foot long in his hand, and then travels toward <HI>Banbury;</HI> where in his rode he espied a Gentleman co∣ming down a hill leading his horse in his hand; <HI>Hind,</HI> as if he took no no∣tice of the Gentleman, went whist∣ting the tune of an ordinary <HI>psalm;</HI> when the Gentleman came to the foot of the hill, where <HI>Hind</HI> now stood whistling his <HI>Psalm;</HI> the Gen∣tleman inquired of him the time of the day, he answered him very civi∣ly; but as the Gentleman was get∣ting on his horse, his back being to∣wards
<PB N="14" REF="8"/><HI>Hind, Hind</HI> hit him such a stroke between the head and the shoulders, that he made him measure his length on the ground; <HI>Hind</HI> pre∣sently seized on his money and cloak, horse and sword, and left him his old coat and his pike staff, to beat on the hoof as he had done, and money he gave him back to bear his char∣ges: But to this day, <HI>The Gentleman loves not the tane of a Psalm.</HI> But now <HI>Hind</HI> being wel horsed, &amp; having money and good cloaths, went to <HI>Banbury,</HI> where he was entertained in a Troop, and quickly acquainted himself with some of his own pro∣fession; and now he begins to rob <HI>Cum Privilegio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hind</HI> being in <HI>Banbury</HI> Garison, where he had good shelter for all his knavery, he makes a new trade: For no Carrier could pass his Roads, without paying Tribute to his Company, or losing the best of their goods: but rather then the
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>Carriers would be always haunted for uncertain sums, they promise him and his Company a certain sti∣pend a week to let them pass: You may easily believe that these Lads did as vigilantly watch their com∣ing from <HI>London</HI> for their promised money; as the Excise-men did in those days, watch the Cattell going to <HI>Smith-Field.</HI></P>
<P>But when the Parliaments For∣ces went against <HI>Banbury,</HI> and his Trade there began to fail; He thought it no Robery to borrow Sir <HI>William Comptons</HI> best horse, who was the Governor then of that Garison, to keep up his Trade in the High-way, seeing his Garison failed.</P>

<HEAD>4. <HI>How</HI> Hind <HI>Rob'd a Gentleman in</HI> Yorkshire, <HI>and afterwards came to the Inn where he lay, to Sup with him; but did not.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman coming from <HI>York;</HI> intended his Journey for <HI>London,</HI> by accident met <HI>Hind;</HI> Who soon made him deliver what money he had: <HI>Hind</HI> delivers him back twenty shillings, to bear his Charges till his Credit would fur∣nish him again: So the Gentle∣man rod on his Journey to the next Town, where he was well known by an Inn-keeper; then being alighted, desired the Host to get supper ready: so the Gen∣tleman went to his Chamber: In the mean time in comes <HI>Hind,</HI> and asked if there were any Gentle∣men that went to <HI>London:</HI> the Host answered, yes, there was one Gen∣tleman alone, and would be glad
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>of any good Company: So <HI>Hind</HI> went up to the Gentlemans Cham∣ber, and saluted him: The Gen∣tleman said, Sir, sit down, and I will tell you how I was robbed to day; and I durst have sworn you had been the man, but that your hair is short, and his was long; Sir, said <HI>Hind,</HI> do you know his horse if you see him: yes, said the Gen∣tleman, very well: To satisfie you, said <HI>Hind,</HI> you shall see mine: So <HI>Hind</HI> went down, and fetcht his Horse out of the Stable, and asked the Gentleman if that were the Horse: He answered, I, I, that's the Horse; <HI>Then Sir,</HI> said Hind, <HI>I cannot sup with you to night, if you know my horse better then my self.</HI></P>

<HEAD>5 <HI>How</HI> Hind <HI>served two Bailies and a Usurer.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>HInd</HI> riding through a little Town in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> he saw a Tumult in the street; so he rid up to them, and desired to know the occasion of the Tumult; one told him, that an honest Inn-kee∣per was Arrested for twenty pound, and that the man was un∣don if he had not some relief spee∣dily; So <HI>Hind</HI> asked the man if he would give him any Security, if he should pay the Debt for him: the poor man being over joyed for this unlookt-for newes; told him, that he would make over all that hee had to him for the Security: So <HI>Hind</HI> had the Usurer and the Bailies into the house, demanded the bond, paid the Usurer all he demanded, giving the Bailies their Fees; and sent for a Scrivner to
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>make over the Inn-keepers goods to him; which being done, they departed; <HI>Hind</HI> being not unmind∣full to enquire of the Usurers way he was to go; went after him; and said to him, Friend, <HI>I lent you twenty pound, but I must have it again:</HI> The Usurer said, <HI>You paid me so much mo∣ney on a Bond: Hind</HI> said, <HI>It is no time to dispute it now:</HI> So he took from the old Usurer his own twenty pound, and twenty pound more, which he had got by his Usury: So <HI>Hind</HI> rod back to the Inn, and gave the Host his Writing again, and five pounds, and told him, <HI>that he had good luck by lending his mo∣ney to honest men.</HI></P>

<HEAD>6 <HI>How</HI> Hind <HI>served a Committee-man who disguised himself for fear of Robbing.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Committee-man having oc∣casion to travel from <HI>Warwick</HI> towards <HI>London,</HI> for to buy many Commodities; hearing that there was robbing in that Road; fitted himself with an old Gray Coat, out at the Elbowes, and an old Mare; and boots instead of Stirups, hang∣ed at a Saddle that was not worth three pence, and a Bridle of the same price: Now rides he merri∣ly, thinking no Highway-man would set on him: but <HI>Money ill got, will be ill spent:</HI> For he chanced to meet with <HI>Hind;</HI> who asked what he was; he replied, <HI>that he was an old man going to get relief among his friends;</HI> so <HI>Hind</HI> gave him a Piece in gold, and bid him drink his health, and be merry at his Inn:
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>the old Miser thinking to please <HI>Hind,</HI> Coined two or three great oaths presently, and said, <HI>He would be drunk with drinking his health that night:</HI> So <HI>Hind,</HI> parted from him; and the old man went to his Inn, and set up his Mare; then he cal∣led for half a pint of Sack; and af∣ter the first glass was down, he be∣gan to say that he escaped the greatest danger that ever he was in; for, I met with <HI>Hind,</HI> said he; and instead of robbing of me, he gave me a Piece in gold, and bid me drink his health; but I will see him hanged before I will spend a penny for his sake: Hang him Rogue, he robs all honest men; onely Cavaliers, he lets them go: Ile put his gold amongst my own: I would have given ten pound to have bin rid of him, when first I met him; so after a short supper, he went to bed. <HI>Hind</HI> came to the Inn; and using to lie there; they
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>told him what the Committee-man had said of him. <HI>Hind</HI> let the old man travel first in the morning: and about an hour after, <HI>Hind</HI> rides after him; and when he had over∣taken him; he asked the old man <HI>if he drunk his health:</HI> I Sir, said he, <HI>I was never so drunk in my life as I was last night; for I drunk the Kings health the Queens, the Princes, and your health ten times over: Hind</HI> said un∣to him, friend, I have found you in many lies: and now I will make you all me Rogue for somthing: So <HI>Hind</HI> made him untie his grea∣sy snapsack; where he found 50 <HI>l.</HI> in gold, and his own piece besides. So the Committee-man to cheer up himself, resolved to borrow of the State so much money, before he went another Journey.</P>

<P><HI>HInd</HI> being deceived of such prizes as he thought most sure of: had spent all the money he had with him: so betimes in the morning he waited an opportuni∣ty to furnish himself, as people were going to a Fair; and meeting with a poor man going to buy a Cow at the Fair. <HI>Hind</HI> bid him stand and deliver such money as he had; The poor man did pull out of his pocket a hankerchief, wherein was four pound: the poor man wept to <HI>Hind,</HI> and told him <HI>it was all that he had in the world, and that he was undone if he took it away: Hind</HI> told him he should not lose one penny by him; but that he would double his money: and ap∣pointed to meet him at a Village
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>near to the place where the poor man dwelt: so <HI>Hind</HI> did take but three pound from the poor man, and went his way; then the poor man went to the Fair among his neighbours, who asked him the occasion of his melancholly; he answered, <HI>That the Market was dear, therefore he would stay till the next Fair:</HI> so he went home making no body acquainted with what had hapned to him: But when the day came that he should meet <HI>Hind,</HI> who had altered his name to the poor man, he went and enquired for such a Gentleman at the place appointed; who was directed by the man of the house to his Chamber: <HI>Hind</HI> presently entertained him well, and gave him <HI>six pound to buy him two Cows;</HI> so the poor man thankt him, and told him that if he had never paid him, he would never have disclosed: So <HI>Hind</HI> seeing him simply honest, and true-hearted,
