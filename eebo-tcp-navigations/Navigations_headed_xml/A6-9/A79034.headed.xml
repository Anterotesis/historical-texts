<HEAD>The Scots Remonstrance or Declaration, for the restoring their declared King to his just Rights and Priviledges, and the raising of an Army of 25000 men.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ince my arrivall in these parts, great hath been my desire to attend your motion, and to salute you with those Occurrences which are of greatest concernment (being high∣ly oblig'd unto you, for your for∣mer manifold favours;) Your last of the 14th instant, seeming to chal∣lenge a return of such overtures; which (with an im∣partiall pen) I shall here represent, desiring they may speedily kisse your hand, and not be concealed from publike view. On the 21 instant, the late Marquesse of <HI>Montross</HI> received sentence of death, and the same day was brought to the place of execution (attend∣ed by divers of the Nobility and Gentry) his gallant deportment, not a little amazing the Spectators; who after a short speech, touching his engagement for his Soveraign, further declared, that if nothing would satisfie the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> but his bloud, that
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>it would be required again at their hands, and that he valued not his life in the least, it being a debt that must be paid; and that it did greatly comfort his dying spirits, to think that he did not onely act, but was to suffer for his Majesty; and said, if he had a hundred lives, he would freely sacrifice them all for his cause, protesting, he never took more delight in riding in a Coach to take his recreation in earthly pleasures, then he did to ride to the place of execu∣tion in a Cart, to be deprived of them. Which decla∣ratory expression being ended, he pull'd off his Be∣ver and gold hat-band, and cast it to a Gentleman standing by him, and lifting up his hands to heaven, desired the Executioner to proceed and do his Office, his spirit not seeming to be troubled, nor his coun∣tenance to change, and his carriage as sweet as ever I saw a mans in all my days. And truly, it is absolutely believed, that he hath gained a better repute amongst those of his faction (by his death) then ever he did in his life. And after three hours hanging on the Gal∣lows, his body was cut down, and his head severed from his sholders, and set upon the Tole-booth of this City, his arms and legs were likewise cut off and commanded to be set upon four principle places of the Kingdom, which are supposed to be <HI>Aberdeen, Glascow, Sterling,</HI> and St. <HI>Johnstons.</HI></P>
<P>This being performed, many of the royall-party seemed very discontented, threatning to be reveng'd, &amp;c. but it is believed, no such thing dare be attempt∣ed, notwithstanding the great activeness of the Pres∣bytery in the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who have set forth a declaration of their loyall integrity to their declared King, and of the carrying on the designe formerly in∣tended
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>by the aforesaid Marquess of <HI>Montross,</HI> protest∣ing; That from their souls they abhor and detest, the delivering of the late King over to bondage, imprison∣ment, and murther; and that they will endeavour to establish his present Majesty, in all his just Rights and priviledges; and in order thereunto, the Mini∣sters in those parts, preach very high in their pulpits, to stir up their severall Congregations to an engage∣ment, against the Sectaries of both Kingdomes (as they are pleased to call them.) But what the event of these revolutions will be, few days will make mani∣fest; It is conceived by many, that had not the blow been given in that nick of time, some sad events would have attended the delay, which (in all probability) will now be prevented; for if Court splendency, great mens deluding perswasions, with designed Nationall advantages, do blinde the eys of the Church general, as wel as thus it did provincial, it may then be percei∣ved, that it is not the name of Presbytery, that will keep conscience unstained, nor crooked turnings aside unblasted, as may be instanced by their late proceed∣ings against those that would not subscribe to the a∣foresaid engagement, imprisoning those that denied it.</P>
<P>Here is an Army raising, by authority from the Committee of Estates, the chief Officers have already received Commissions, they intend to levy 20000 horse and foot, to be added to the old modell of 5000; and declare, that it is for the defence of their Country, but it is to be suspected, their designe is against <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> whether so or not, I am not able to resolve; but I can assure you, the <HI>Scots</HI> look upon a party in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> as a perfidious and Covenant-breaking people, and say, they are bound to maintain the solemn league and Covenant.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Nauferling</HI> is returned from <HI>Breda,</HI> with a Copy of their young Kings Condescensions, which seems satisfactory to many; and there are thoughts amongst the great ones, of proclaiming him a new upon his arrivall; some giving out, that he is expect∣ed about the 10th of <HI>june,</HI> but how true I know not: Others report, he is not to be received untill he hath signed all the Articles, which it's believed, hee will not now stick to do, considering the great blow gi∣ven to <HI>Montross.</HI></P>
<P>We hear that he hath lately received a letter from the <HI>Queen</HI> his Mother; Wherein she seems to be some∣what displeased at his Agreement with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and urgeth that he will be totally ruined thereby, for want of following her advice, and making good pro∣vision in behalf of the Roman Catholicks.</P>
<P>Divers Scottish ships are already rigged, and ready to put forth to Sea, being well mann'd, and accom∣modated with plenty of warlike provision; they pre∣tend (onely) to be for the guard of their own Seas, and to maintain their own interes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but many con∣ceive, that their designe is to attend the motion of their Land forces; who since the concluding of the Treaty at <HI>Breda,</HI> give out high speeches; <HI>viz.</HI> That they hope that the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland</HI> will soon be in a case of restoring their King to a flourishing condi∣tion, if he will become a reformed Presbyter. The Marquesse of <HI>Argile</HI> stands firm for the preservation of the League and Amity between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> and hath openly declared, that he will not be instru∣mentall for the fomenting of new differences, &amp;c. which doth not a little retard the designe of the new modelling Army.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>Thus having in a brief and impartiall manner com∣municated those things that seem to be of greatest concernment; I desire to participate of your intelli∣gence at <HI>London,</HI> and if I may not seem to exceed the bounds of modesty in my request, the continuance thereof will bee very acceptable to him, who re∣mains</P>

<HEAD>The Copy of a Letter out of the West.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis morning we received an expresse from <HI>Pen∣dennis</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> intimating, That the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had landed some forces in the Island of <HI>Scilly,</HI> and that he had sent a Letter, (with a Declaration en∣closed) to divers of the Gentry in <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> shewing the grounds and reasons of his present engagement, and that his chief aim and ends, tend to nothing else, but the advancement of his Majesties cause, and restoring of the subject to his just liberty and propriety, &amp;c. with many other fair glosses, in∣termixed with severall invectives against the present government and authority; and withall, desires them to
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>cast off their present yoak, and to remain no longer subject to their commands; And to the end that his advice might take the deeper impression upon them, he dispatched severall Agents to <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devon∣shire,</HI> for the dispersing of these papers amongst the in∣habitants, and to withdraw and alienate their tender affections from the present Government and Autho∣rity of the Nation; but in the execution thereof, some of them were apprehended, and by the great vigilancy of Sir <HI>Hardress Waller,</HI> the plot was discovered; which otherwise, in few days might have proved of dange∣rous consequence to the Republique, by reason of the great forwardness of many, in under-hand and pri∣vate listings: Which designe not taking effect, it is said, that the Inhabitants in those parts are now re∣solved to stand firm to the present power and Autho∣rity, and to live and dye with them, in the preserva∣tion and safety of <HI>Englands</HI> liberty, against all former opposition whatsoever.</P>
