<HEAD>A bloody Fight at Sea, between the Eng∣lish, French, Dutch, and Portugals; the particulars thereof, the number of ships sunk and taken; and the manner how the Parliaments ships boarded the French three times, but were still repulsed and beaten off; but laying them aboard the fourth time, forced them under Decks, killed many, and took divers prisoners.</HEAD>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 13. of this instant (after a tempestuous storm) it pleased God to admit us a fair Gale, and a seasonable calm, untill such time that we had coasted neer the point of <HI>Gibralterre,</HI> where we made a discovery of the rest of our Fleet under the Con∣duct of Vice-Admirall <HI>Pen;</HI> and coming up to them, our Captain was called aboard the <HI>Fairfax</HI> Frigat, where a Councel of Officers were present; and after some serious consultation touchin the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> Fleet in the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/><HI>Streights,</HI> unanimously resolved to steer towards that coast, and fight them; and accordingly on the 14 instant, we weighed anchor, and after 9 hours sayl came within sight of them; which they perceiving, immediatly prepared to re∣ceive Us, opening their port-holes, put forth their Guns, and man'd their Decks; for indeed they were at least three to one; being about 33 Sayl, and most consisting of those Bankers which were the onely Pyrats that had most an∣noy'd the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch:</HI> Our Fleet consisted of but nine sayl, but very resolved men; as appears by the ensu∣ing Narrative, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>When we came within a league of their Rear. Admirall, Orders were given for each man to make ready to man the Decks, the Gunners and their Assistants to prepare and o∣pen their port-holes; and so each man according to his place and calling, to endeavour what in him lay to perform that duty and service which God had called him unto: This was with great care and prudence observed; and immedi∣atly the Red Flag in every ship was put forth; which be∣ing done, the Trumpets sounded, the Marriners shouted, and soon after the Canons plaid; for when we came within half a league of them, about 13 of their best ships were manned forth, who gave us several broad sides; which Captain <HI>Pen</HI> perceiving, immediatly made up to them with the <HI>Fairfax,</HI> the <HI>Lyon,</HI> the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> and the <HI>George,</HI> and gave them eight broad sides; insomuch that the Enemy decli∣ned engagement, and would fain have deserted us; but C. <HI>Pen</HI> keeping close up with them to the rest of their ships, the whole Fleets became engaged; and a bloudy fight en∣sued, which continued for the space of two hours, and very gallantly maintained on both sides: For the <HI>Lyon</HI> laid the <HI>French</HI> Admiral aboard three times, and was still repulsed and beaten off; but the fourth time she carryed it, and
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>hailing her close, entred the ship, and put most of the men to the sword, for they denied quarter. During this dispute, the valiant <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and the rest of our Fleet, plyed them close with great and small shot, and killed many of them, especially the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who lay the most open to out shot, for they charged their Canon on the out-side of their ships: In this conflict we sunk 7, and boarded five more; and at last dispiersed the whole Navy, taking about 15 sayl of them; so that there are not many got off, but some few <HI>Pickroons,</HI> which were too swift for us; but I am confident, they cannot be very serviceable; for the ships that we have taken are exceedingly torn, and most of the men either kil∣led or wounded; so resolutely did they fight it out. And truly I may say, that such a mercy never did God bestow upon his poor servants at Sea, as he hath done upon Us, in giving of Us Victory over our Enemies, and making Us in∣strumental for the vanquishing such a formidable pyrati∣cal power as these were, with so little losse; for from the beginning to the ending, we lost not above 20 men, some few wounded, and our ships not much defaced or torn: God grant that we may live to praise &amp; glorifie the Name of the Lord for this happy deliverance: And likewise for the many and wonderful deliverances which He hath dis∣pensed to his servants.</P>
<P>Two Dutch men of War came in to our assistance about the middle of the fight; but its conjectur'd, that it was more for their own ends, then for any love they bare to us: however, I shall censure charitably; for we have lost no∣thing, but they haue gain'd; having by this means inlarg'd their liberty upon these Coasts.</P>

<P>ON the 19. of this instant <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1651.

About 9 a clock the next day they sent to the Governour for a cessa∣tion, who finding it would be no wayes prejudicial to him to de∣lay time, he being in want of provision and accomodation, (they coming so unexpectedly upon them,) they agreed upon a cessation, until 7. a Clock next morning. We had no intelligence of the busi∣ness at <HI>Waterford,</HI> until 4. a Clock on the Lords day, but upon no∣tice thereof we made out with all the Boats and Vessels we could procure, and fell down that night within a mile of the Town, and about 10. or 11. a Clock at night the Enemy quitted the place and marched away, having agreed with the Townsmen to pay them 400 l. to save the Town from burning. Since which time we have received intelligence that Col. <HI>Cook,</HI> and Col. <HI>Axtel,</HI> with Col. <HI>Prette,</HI> have given the same Enemy a repulse, comming upon them in the County of <HI>Kildare,</HI> fell upon their reare as they were going o∣ver a passe, put them to the run, pursuing them 4. or 5. miles, about
