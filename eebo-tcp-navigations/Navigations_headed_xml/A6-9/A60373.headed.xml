<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT's a Matter worthy of ones enquiry, how a Nation, as <HI>SCOT∣LAND,</HI> so much addicted to <HI>Military Arts,</HI> and so constantly ingaged in both Foreign and Domestick Wars, should have been in a Capacity to erect such superb Edifices as that Kingdom abounds with. There is no Country in <HI>Europe</HI> that can brag either of greater Piles of Buildings, or a more regular Architecture in its Ancient Churches and Religious Fabricks, than <HI>Scotland</HI> was Mistress of about an Age or Two ago. To instance One for all, the Metropolitan Church of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> was probably the bigest in <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI> being Seven Foot longer and Two Foot broader than that of St. <HI>Peter</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI>; and for the Heighth and Embellishing of its Pillars and Roof, the Beauty of its Stones, and Simetry of its parts, was one of the best of the <HI>Gothick</HI> kind in the World.</P>
<P><HI>READER,</HI> You may receive this Impartial Account from me as a Foreigner, who am now settled in this Nation; and having met with the usual Civility and Kindness Strangers are treated with a∣mongst them, it is no wonder if I am tempted to leave some little Marks of Gratitude behind me, in transmitting to Posterity those <HI>Ve∣nerable Remains</HI> of former Ages, and oblige other Nations with the Pro∣spects of so many considerable Places; which I presume will be very ac∣ceptable to them. It is a Work of so great Charge, and will require so many Volumes, that I cannot satisfy the Publick but from Time to Time in it. And according to the Reception these first Endeavours shall meet with, it will encourage me to go on with the rest. In the mean time, I hope no Person will take Exceptions, though the Towns, and such of the Nobility, whose Arms are here inserted, are not always placed conform to the Rank they keep in Parliament; it being a Thing which cannot be adjusted in a Work of this Nature till the whole Design is compleated.</P>

<HEAD> EDINBURGH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDINBƲRGH</HI> is situated in <HI>Mid-Lothian,</HI> a Shire of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> It is the Chief City of the Kingdom, and Royal Seat. It far surpasseth all the other Cities of the Kingdom in the Stateliness of its Churches, the Beauty and Neatness of its publick and private Buildings, the Pleasantness of its Site, the Large∣ness of its Precincts, the Number and Opulency of its Inhabitants, and Dignity of its Rulers. By the most ancient Inhabitants it was called <HI>Dun Eden</HI>; by the <HI>Latins, Edinodunum,</HI> and by the <HI>Germans, Edin∣burghen</HI>; all which signifie the same thing.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7"/><HI>Dun Eden</HI> signifies a Town upon a Hill, or rather a City of the <HI>Edeni,</HI> situated on a Hill. The <HI>Edeni</HI> are those who by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> are termed <HI>Ottodeni,</HI> which Word (as some Learned Men think) was mis∣taken for <HI>Scottodeni,</HI> the two first Letters <HI>Sc</HI> being worn out with Time: For near to this City is <HI>Curia Ottodenorum,</HI> whose Name remains to this Day in a Village Four Miles West from the City, called <HI>Currie</HI>: And two Miles West from the Town is <HI>Corstopitum</HI> (which also was among the <HI>Ottodeni</HI>) which is a Village commonly called <HI>Corstorfin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls this Place <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Castrum alatum,</HI> the <HI>Winged Castle,</HI> which is not so called from that kind of Wings which the <HI>Greek</HI> Builders (as says <HI>Vitruvius</HI>) call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (which are double Walls so rising to the Height, that they resemble Wings: For it is likely there was no regular building in that Place at that time) but that they were such as by the Poet <HI>Juvenal</HI> are called <HI>Castella Bri∣gantum</HI>; which sort of Castles we may see described by <HI>Tacitus, Annal. Lib.</HI> XII. where he says, That upon high Mountains, and other Places of difficult Access, he built up Stones in Form of a Fence, where the River did run on a slippery Ford. Now these Fences of Stone were nothing else, but Stones cast together without Mortar, which is also clear from the same Author in the fore-cited Place, where he says, The Souldiers holding their Bucklers over their Heads for a Defence, pulled down the unwrought and ill-built Stones; which could not have been so easily done, if they had not been cast together without Mortar. And certainly our Ancestors chose out this as a very fit Place for a Fort of that Nature: For the Hill where the Castle stands is exceeding steep and craggy, and the Ascent very difficult, except where it looks to the East, which Part they fortified with Stones cast together as before. The Ascent on which the City now stands had, and yet hath upon the North-side, a standing Pool, which is commonly called the <HI>North-Loch.</HI> Upon the South-side of the Hill there was likewise another standing-Pool called the <HI>South-Loch:</HI> The Verity of which the Rights and Lea∣ses of some Houses of St. <HI>Ninian</HI>'s Row, do testifie, which are let with the Privilege of a Boat annexed; and these two <HI>Lochs</HI> or <HI>Lakes</HI> bounded the City upon these two Sides, as the <HI>North-Loch</HI> does it at this Day upon the North-side; but the <HI>South-Loch</HI> was drained a Hun∣dred Years ago, and upon the Banks thereof are built two several Tracts of Houses, between which (in the Place where the <HI>Loch</HI> it self stood) is a Street called the <HI>Cowgate.</HI> And so the Breadth of the City
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
toward the South, is far extended beyond its former Limits; as like∣wise the Length thereof toward the West is much enlarged, for the Grass Market and Horse Market are now within the City-Wall.</P>
<P>The Reason why this Place is called <HI>Castrum Alatum,</HI> or <HI>The winged Castle,</HI> is to be taken from the very Nature of the Place: For, besides the Lakes on both sides, there are two Hills near the Rock on which the Castle stands, <HI>viz. Sarisbury</HI> and <HI>Neils Craigs,</HI> so named from the sometime Owners thereof, which in a manner resemble Wings, as is easily perceived Coming to the City from the South-East by the Sea Side; for then these Rocks appear like Wings stretched forth, and the Rock on which the Castle stands, like the Head of a Bird with a Tuft. And this is the genuine Derivation of the Word.</P>
<P>I know there are some learned Persons who will have <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s <HI>Castrum Alatum,</HI> to be in another part of the Country, and not to be <HI>Edinodu∣num,</HI> seeing he makes his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to be amongst the <HI>Vacomagi</HI>; but <HI>Ptolomy</HI> must be born with in all his Mistakes of the Situation of Pla∣ces here; for being an <HI>Egyptian,</HI> living in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and forced to take things upon Trust, and follow the Relation of others, it is no Wonder if he be sometimes mistaken.</P>
<P>The greater Part of the City is built upon the Ascent, and it is very probable that the Castle has been the Cause of Building the City: For first the Neighbours have built a few Houses near the Castle, that under the Reach thereof they might be defended from the Injuries of their Enemies. The Number of the People growing apace, the Num∣ber of the Houses likewise encreased, and stretched forth to the very Foot of the Ascent toward the East; by which the City, together with the Suburbs of the <HI>Canon-gate</HI> and King's Palace, is become one entire <HI>Scotch</HI> Mile in length; but in breadth it is less by the half, notwith∣standing the Suburbs be included. The High Street from the Castle to the Abbey is adorned with stately Buildings, which are of late made of hewen Stone, since that by an Act of the Town-Council it hath been prohibited (for the frequent burnings which happened) to build any more Timber-Houses either in the City or Suburbs.</P>
<P>The great Breadth of the High Street, and of the many Lanes which lie on each side the same, from the North to the South (which send up the Air as it were in Pipes into the High Street) and the Nearness of the two Hills called <HI>Neils Craigs</HI> on the North, and <HI>Sarisbury Craigs</HI> on the South, do always refresh the
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
Town with Air; which conduces not a little to the Wholesomeness hereof, and it was never heard that the Plague raged in it, except brought in thither by infected Wares. Which Purity of the Air is daily encreased since the Time that excellent fresh Water was brought into the City from a Fountain three Miles distant from the same, and that by a most wise Act of the Council all Nastiness is removed.</P>
<P>The City is enclosed with a kind of an Old <HI>Roman</HI> Wall on every side, except towards the North, where the <HI>North-Loch</HI> does secure it instead of a Wall.</P>
<P>The City is entered by six Gates or Ports: Two of which are to the East, two to the South, one to the West, and one lately made to the North.</P>
<P>One of the Gates to the East is called the <HI>Netherbow,</HI> which in the Year 1616, was magnificently rebuilt, being the chief Gate of the City, adorned with Towers on both sides.</P>
<P>The other Gate to the East is called the <HI>Cowgate Port,</HI> through which there is an Entry into the Nether Street, of the length of the whole City, and is called the <HI>Cowgate.</HI></P>
<P>The Eastmost of these Gates to the South (through which is an Entry into the City) is called the <HI>Potter-Row Port,</HI> from the Suburb called the <HI>Potter-Row.</HI></P>
<P>The Westmost of these is called the <HI>Society Port,</HI> properly the <HI>Brewer</HI>'s <HI>Port.</HI> They have a great square Court in that Place, with Buildings and brave Houses round about it, to the very Walls of the City.</P>
<P>The West-Gate at the other End of the City, lying beneath the Castle, affords an Entry from the Suburb of the same Name.</P>
<P>The North-Gate, which was last made at the Lower End of the <HI>North-Loch,</HI> is twofold, the Inner and the Outer Port, through which there is an Entry into the City from the Suburb called the <HI>Mutter</HI>'s <HI>Hill.</HI></P>
<P>There are two Streets extending the whole length of the Town. The chief Street which is also called the Higher, is one of the broadest in <HI>Europe</HI>: From it there run many Lanes on both sides. The Nether or Lower Street hath also many Lanes running to the South.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8"/>In the very middle of the City there is a Cathedral Church, which is called St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Church, of such Largeness that it is divided into three Churches, every one of which has its own Parish. It is built of hewen Stone, adorned with Pillars and <HI>Vaultings</HI> of Stone. In the middle it forms a perfect Cross, by four Parts of this Church meeting together, and they support a stately, high Tower, with a Top of curious Workman-ship, repre∣senting an Imperial Crown. Beside this Cathedral Church there are in the City,</P>
<P>The South-Church, called the <HI>Gray-Friars</HI> Church, which stands in the middle of the common Burial-place. Many Tombs and Monuments do surround the Church-Yard, amongst which that of Sir <HI>George Mackenzy</HI> does appear like a <HI>Mausolaeum.</HI></P>
<P>There is also a Church of square hewen Stone with a Tower built in the Year 1641, which is called the <HI>Trone</HI>-Church.</P>
<P>The Collegiate-Church of the <HI>Sacred Trinity,</HI> was built by <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Gueldres,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> the second's Queen, where also she lies interred.</P>
<P>Near to this Church is the Hospital of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in which the poorer sort of Inhabitants, both Men and Women, are maintained splendidly enough, and have their own proper Chaplain.</P>
<P>Over-against this Church is the <HI>Correction-House,</HI> commonly called <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Work,</HI> in which there are divers Manufacturies of Linen, Wooll and Silk, where dissolute Persons are forced to earn their Living with their Labour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lady Yester</HI>'s Church, was built by one of the Lady <HI>Yesters,</HI> who also left a Summ of Money for maintaining a good and able Man to preach and perform Divine Service therein.</P>
<P>Besides these Churches there are two Chapels in the City, that of St. <HI>Magdalen</HI>'s in the <HI>Cowgate,</HI> and St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in <HI>Nedries Wind.</HI> There is another Chapel of the same Name at the Foot of the <HI>Can∣non-Gate</HI>; as likewise several <HI>Meeting-Houses</HI> lately built, both in the City and Suburbs.</P>
<P>About the middle of the <HI>Cannon-Gate,</HI> upon the North-side of it, there is built, within these Five Years, a very beautiful Church, and a considerable Piece of Ground inclosed for a Church-Yard, by a Mortification made by Sir <HI>Thomas Moodie</HI> of <HI>Sachten-Hall,</HI> for that Purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>Near unto the Cathedral Church is the <HI>Parliament-House,</HI> where the three Estates of the Kingdom do convene. It stands in a great Court, the North-side whereof is bounded by the Church it self; the West-side is inclosed by the Council-House, where the Town-Council assembles; the South-side is inclosed by the Sessions-House, where the Judges and Lords of Session sit to give Justice to the People. In the upper Part of this Building are the Privy-Council and Exchequer-Chambers. The rest of the South and East-side of this Court, is inclosed with the Upper and Lower Exchange, and with a Tract of most stately Build∣ings. Here is one of the highest Houses in the World, mounting se∣ven Stories above the Parliament-Court, and being built upon a great Descent of the Hill, the back Part of it is as far below it, so that from the Bottom to the Top, One Stair-Case ascends 14 Stories high.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Court is the Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. in Brass, erected upon a stately Pedestal, at the Charge of the City of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>About Twenty Years ago the said Magistrates were at a vast Ex∣pence also to bring one of the best Springs in <HI>Scotland</HI> into the City, by Leaden Pipes from a Hill above Three Miles distant from it; and they have erected several stately Fountains in the middle of the High Street, to serve the Town with Water.</P>
<P>In <HI>Gray</HI>'s <HI>Close</HI> near the <HI>Netherbow,</HI> is the <HI>Mint-House,</HI> with a large Court, adorned with most neat and convenient Buildings, for Accom∣modation of the Over-seers and Work-men thereunto belonging.</P>
<P>Upon the South-side is the College of King <HI>James</HI> the VI. founded in the Year 1580, endowed with all the Privileges of an University. It hath most large Precincts inclosed with Walls and divided into Three Courts, Two Lower and One Higher, which is equal to both the other in Largeness. These Courts or <HI>Area's</HI> are adorned on all sides with excellent Buildings. There is also a high Tower built over the great Entry.</P>
<P>The publick Schools are large. There is likewise a very large Com∣mon-Hall, in which Theology and the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue is taught, and publick Orations made. There is a Library with all Sorts of Books and some Manuscripts. Under the Library is the King's <HI>Printing-House.</HI></P>
<P>There is very good Accommodation for the Students, and neat and handsome Dwellings for the Professors; with very fine Gardens for their Recreation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9"/>The <HI>Castle</HI> is situated at the Head of the Town to the West, where the Hill doth rise into a large Top. It is a very <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for it both hangs over, and commands the Town. The Rock on which the Castle is situated, is upon the South, West and North, inaccessible. The Entry to the Castle is from the Town. The chief Defence on this side is of the round Battery; at the Foot of which there is a designed Out-work, which is not yet brought to a Condition of Defence, and will add very much to the Strength of it when finished. In the Castle also is a Royal Palace of hewen Stone, where the <HI>Regalia</HI> of the King∣dom are kept. This Castle is the Chief Magazine for the Arms and Ammunition of the Nation, and hath a most pleasant Prospect to the neighbouring Fields, and to the River of <HI>Forth,</HI> from whence it is sa∣luted by such Ships of War as come to an Anchor in <HI>Leith</HI> Road. The Governours of this Fortress since King <HI>Charles</HI> the II's Restau∣ration, have been, the Earl of <HI>Middleton,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>Lauderdale, Queensbury</HI> and <HI>Gordon,</HI> and since their Sacred Majesties Accession to the Throne of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Levin</HI> hath the Chief Com∣mand of it.</P>
<P><HI>Heriot</HI>'s <HI>Hospital</HI> is likewise within the City, Situated to the West of the publick Burial-Place. It is a Nursery for Boys, in which the Ci∣tizens Children who are poor, are brought up, under the Tutelage of a Governour, who, according to the Constitution of the Founder, is to live Single. They have likewise a Chaplain to instruct them in the Grounds of Learning, till they be fitted for the publick Schools and Colleges.</P>
<P>This Hospital was founded by <HI>George Heriot,</HI> Jeweller to King <HI>James</HI> the VI. who was descended of the Family of <HI>Trebroun</HI>; and after he had lost two Sons by Shipwrack going from <HI>Scotland</HI> for <HI>London,</HI> where dying without Issue, <HI>February</HI> the 15<HI>th.</HI> 1624. he left in Legacy to this Hospital Two Hundred Thousand Pounds <HI>Scots</HI> Money, that Youth might be maintain'd therein, and instructed in Arts and Sciences till they were of mature Age, having left the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> his Executors.</P>
<P>This Fabrick is stately like a Palace, the Statue of the Foun∣der being erected upon the inner Frontispiece. Round about the Houses are most pleasant Gardens adorned with large Walks and plea∣sant Greens.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Without the Walls of the City are the Suburbs, amongst which that which lies from the <HI>Netherbow</HI> to the Abbey, called the <HI>Cannon-gate,</HI> hath the Preheminence. It is adorned with goodly Buildings and fine Gardens. Upon the North-side of it is the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> where the Bay∣liffs of the same do convene for the Administration of Justice. On the South-side is a very fine House belonging to the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> with very pleasant Gardens adjoining.</P>
<P>At the Lower End of this Suburb is the Abbey of <HI>Holyrood-House,</HI> founded by King <HI>David</HI> for the Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Augustine.</HI> This was consumed by Fire, and the Church only remains, in which divers of our Kings and Queens are interred.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Palace</HI> hath four Courts. The Outer Court, which is as big as all the rest, hath four Principal Entries (besides several Inlets into the adjacent Gardens) three of which are on the West, and the other on the East-side.</P>
<P>The Entry of the Palace is adorned with great Pillars of hewen Stone, and a fine Cupola in Fashion of a Crown above it. The Fore∣part of the Palace is terminated by four high Towers, Two of which toward the North were erected by King <HI>James</HI> the V. and the rest by King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. The Fabrick of the Inner-Court is very stately, with <HI>Piazza's</HI> round about it, all of fine hewen Stone. From these co∣vered Walks you have Access to the several Apartments which are most Royal and Magnificent. But above all the long Gallery is re∣markable, being adorn'd with the Pictures of all the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> from <HI>Fergus</HI> I.</P>
<P>The Palace on all Hands is bounded with lovely Gardens. On the South lies the King's Park, which hath great Variety of medicinal Plants. Here also is an admirable Fountain, which through Conduits serves the whole House. His Grace the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> is hereditary Keeper of this Palace.</P>

<HEAD> DUNBRITTON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DƲMBARTON</HI> or <HI>Dunbritton,</HI> is a Town in the Sheriff∣dom of <HI>Lennox,</HI> which <HI>Beda</HI> calls <HI>Allclyth,</HI> others <HI>Allcluith.</HI> It has its Name from <HI>Dun,</HI> which in our ancient Lan∣guage signifies a Hill or Rock, and <HI>Bar</HI> which in the same Language signifies the Top or Height of any Thing.</P>
<P>The Town is situate in a Plain on the Bank of the River <HI>Levin,</HI> near the Place where it enters into <HI>Clyde,</HI> a little below the Castle, which is excellently fortified by Nature, owing little to Art; and seems to have been built by the Ancient <HI>Brigantes.</HI> This Town had its Privileges procured to it by One of the Countesses of <HI>Lennox.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle hath a strange kind of Situation; for where the Waters of <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Levin</HI> meet, there's a Plain extended to the length of a Mile at the Foot of the neighbouring Hills: And in the very Corner of this Meet∣ing there rises a Rock with two Tops, the higher of which looks to
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
the West, with a Watch-Tower on the Top of it, having a large Pro∣spect on all Sides. The other being a little lower lies to the East. Be∣twixt these two Tops are Steps hewen out of the Rock with great Pains and Labour, which yield Passage only to one Person at a Time, to the upper Part of the Castle. To the South where <HI>Clyde</HI> runs by the Rock which is naturally steep, it hath a little Descent, and as it were with out-stretcht Arms embraces the plain Ground; which partly by Nature and partly by Art is so enclosed, that it furnishes Room for several Houses and a Garden. It secures the Harbour by its Ordnance, and obliges the smaller Boats to come up almost to the very Gate of the Castle, the Chanal of the River running on that Side. The mid∣dle of the Rock where the Entry to the Castle is, being built up with Houses, makes as it were another Castle distinct from the former. This Castle, as appears by its Prospects, does almost stand like a Sugar-loaf upon a plain Ground. The Circumference of it is but very small, and yet it hath at the Top a little kind of a Lake and several other Springs. Be∣sides the natural Fortification, it is bounded on the West by the Water of <HI>Levin,</HI> and on the South by <HI>Clyde,</HI> which are to it instead of Ditches. To the East, the Sea at a full Tide beats against the Foot of the Rock; and when it ebbs it does not leave a Plain of Sand, but of a soft Clay, which is divided by a Rivulet that runs down from the neighbouring Hills.</P>

<HEAD> STIRLING.</HEAD>
<P><HI>STIRLING</HI> is the Chief Town of the Shire of that Name, where the Sheriff keeps his Courts. It hath its Name from its Situa∣tion; for the Town stands upon the Descent of a steep Rock, at the Foot of which there runs a deep River call'd <HI>Boderia</HI> or <HI>Forth.</HI> It takes its Name from the <HI>Saxon</HI> Word <HI>Ster,</HI> which signifies a Hill, and <HI>Lin</HI> a Water.</P>
<P>It was of old called <HI>Binobara,</HI> which by some is judged to be <HI>Ptolo∣my</HI>'s <HI>Vindovara</HI>: For <HI>Bin</HI> in our old Language signifies a Hill, and <HI>Vara</HI> a River: So that the Name which the Town now retains, is the Signi∣fication of the old Name thereof.</P>
<P>At the Head of the Town stands a well fortified Castle, adorned with stately Buildings in the former Age, by King <HI>James</HI> the V. This is the Place, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> observes, where <HI>Clyde</HI> and <HI>Forth</HI> being car∣ried back divide from one another. For a great way they are separa∣ted by a small Neck of Land, which was then strengthned by a Garrison; and all that <HI>Isthmus</HI> was possessed by Soldiers, the Ene∣mies being removed as it were into another Island, the Inscription
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
on a Stone below the Castle toward the Bridge, which makes mention of a Wing of the Army that kept Watch there, seeming to intimate as much: And although the <HI>Romans</HI> did several times infest some Places beyond it by their Inroads, yet the Strength and Glory of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name had its Bound in this Place.</P>
<P>The King's Park lies at the very Foot of the Castle, and the City stands on the Back of a Hill toward the South. It is enclosed with a Wall, and toward the North, it is bounded with the River <HI>Forth,</HI> which crossed by a Bridge in that Place.</P>
<P>The Bridge is of hewen Stone, and fortified with an Iron-Gate. It consists of four stately Arches, and lies South and North.</P>
<P>The Ships at full Tide come up to the Bridge, and the Haven is a little below the same.</P>
<P>The Church, which is of hewen Stone built very artificially, stands in the Upper Part of the Town toward the East, adorned with a very high Tower.</P>
<P>Not far from the Church may be seen the Mansions of the Earls of <HI>Argyle</HI> and <HI>Marr,</HI> notable both for their Bigness and Artifice of their Structure.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Marr</HI> is Governour of this Castle by Heritage. It hath a competent Number of Great Ordnance, for defending the Passage of the Bridge, and a sufficient Garrison established for its Security.</P>
<P>In times of Trouble the Chief Magazine of the Nation is usually transported to this Place, it lying upon a considerable Pass, and almost in the Center of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>As this City stands in a most commodious Place for Commerce, so it hath a most delectable and pleasant Prospect, by the great and va∣rious Windings of the River <HI>Forth,</HI> which are so extraordinary, that from the Bridge of <HI>Stirling</HI> to the Town of <HI>Allowa,</HI> it is 24 Miles by Water, and but 4 by Land.</P>
<P><HI>ALLOWA,</HI> a Town in <HI>Clackmannon-shire,</HI> and seems to be the same <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls <HI>Allauna,</HI> is situated on a pleasant Plain to the North of <HI>Forth</HI>; and hath a convenient Harbour for Ships of Burthen, many of which come thither for Salt and Coals. Here the Earl of <HI>Marr,</HI> Chief of the <HI>Areskins,</HI> hath a pleasant Dwelling with a Wood adjacent.</P>

<P>SAINT <HI>ANDREWS,</HI> in Latin, <HI>Andreanopolis,</HI> or <HI>Fanum Sancti Andreae,</HI> has its Name from St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> whose Bones are said to be brought hither from <HI>Patras,</HI> a Town in <HI>Pelopon∣nesus,</HI> by <HI>Regulus</HI> a <HI>Grecian</HI> Monk, <HI>Anno</HI> 368. a Man in that Age much esteem'd for Piety, as appears by the Church dedicated to him, and called after his Name. From him also (as ancient Writers report) this Town was at first called <HI>Regimund,</HI> that is, <HI>Mons sancti Reguli</HI>; for we read that <HI>Oengus,</HI> or <HI>Ʋngus,</HI> King of the <HI>Picts,</HI> did grant to <HI>God</HI> and Saint <HI>Andrew,</HI> That he should be Head of all Churches within the Jurissdiction of the <HI>Picts.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise it is manifest from Old Manuscripts, that this was the prin∣cipal See of the <HI>Culdai,</HI> who had the care and management of Holy Things from the first reception of Christianity in those Parts.</P>
<P>This City is the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the whole Kingdom, and the See of an Archbishop, who is Primate of all <HI>Scotland.</HI> It lies towards the East with a pleasant Prospect to the Ocean, having a Harbour for Ships, the Sea

near it plentiful in Fishes, and Fields wholesome and spacious.</P>
<P>There yet remain the Marks of Venerable Antiquity, the Ruines of the Cathedral Church and Monastery, which do abundantly testifie their Ancient Glory and Magnificence. The Town it self is situate in a Plain, from East to West, with a most pleasant Prospect to the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Ocean. It had a very strong Castle of Old, whose Rubbish and Ruines are yet to be seen upon the Rocks on the Sea-side towards the North. It has Streets straight and broad, stretching East and West, whereof two lead to that once famous Abbey of <HI>Canons Regular</HI> of the Order of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> situate toward the East and South-East, the Wall surrounding this Abbey being yet intire, and of hewen Stone, with many Towers and Turrets which give it the Resemblance of a King's Palace.</P>
<P>The Chief Church in the Town now, is that called the <HI>New Church,</HI> not far from the <HI>New College.</HI> In it there is to be seen a very Magnifi∣cent Monument of Archbishop <HI>Sharp.</HI></P>
<P>There is also another Church called St. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s adjacent to a Col∣lege of the same Name, the Rector whereof is ordinarily the Principal of the said College; but the greatest Ornament of the City is the University, the <HI>Athens</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> consisting at present of Three Col∣leges; and was first founded by <HI>Laurentius Lindoris,</HI> and <HI>Richardus Cor∣vellus,</HI> Doctors of Law, and publick Professors of Philosophy.</P>
<P>The College of St. <HI>Salvator,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Old College,</HI> was founded by <HI>James Kennedie</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> together with a Church beautified with an high towering Steeple all of hewen Stone, in which his Monument of curious Workman-ship is yet to be seen. Mr. <HI>Skene</HI> Doctor of Divinity and Principal of the College, has of late repaired and augmented the Fabrick thereof, having made a Collection for that end. He has also founded a <HI>Library,</HI> which by the Donations of lear∣ned Men is now very well furnished with good Books.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Leonard</HI>'s College was founded by <HI>James Hepburn,</HI> Prior of St. <HI>Andrews</HI>; in which are several Professors, as first the Principal, who is always Doctor of Divinity, and Four Professors of Philosophy, to whom <HI>John Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots Tarvett</HI> Knight, added a Professor of Philology, with a liberal Salary, and augmented the Library with the Gift of several considerable Volumes.</P>
<P>It is likewise of late very much increased by Sir <HI>John Wedderburne,</HI> Doctor of Physick, who dying left his great Collection of Books to

it. Here also is the famous Manuscript of the <HI>Scottish</HI> Chronologer, <HI>John Fordon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>New College</HI> was founded by <HI>James Beaton</HI> Archbishop. In it are two Professors, always Doctors in Divinity, the One stiled <HI>Prin∣cipal Professor of Theology,</HI> the Other only <HI>Professor of Theology</HI>; to which of late is added a Professor of Mathematicks; the first Professor whereof, Mr. <HI>James Gregory,</HI> erected a Commodious Observatory for Mathematical Observations in the College Garden, having caus'd a Contribution to be made for that Purpose. He also furnished it with ma∣ny Mathematical Instruments much better than it had before his Time.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander</HI> the I. King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> founded a Priory here for the Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> the Government of the <HI>Picts</HI> being abolished in <HI>Britain</HI>; and <HI>Kenneth</HI> III. tranferred the Epi∣scopal See from <HI>Abernethie</HI> to St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> about the Year 850.</P>

<HEAD> GLASGOW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GLASGOW</HI> is the most famous Empory of all the West of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Nothwithstanding that it is inferiour to many in Antiquity, yet if we respect the Largeness of the City, the Number and Stateliness of its publick and private Buildings, its Commerce with Foreign Nations, and the Opulency of its Inhabitants, it is the Chief of all the Cities in the Kingdom next to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The City stands most pleasantly upon the East Bank of <HI>Clyde,</HI> which is navigable up to the very Tower, by Ships of small Burden; but <HI>New Glasgow</HI> which stands on the Mouth of <HI>Clyde,</HI> is a Haven for Vessels of the greatest Size. The City it self is joined to the Suburbs, which stand on the West Brink, by a beautiful Bridge of Eight Arches, built of square hewen Stone.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="19"/>The most part of the City stands on a Plain, and is in a Manner four-square. In the very middle of the City is the <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> magnifi∣cently built of hewen Stone, with a very high Tower, and Bells which sound melodiously at every Hour's end. At the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> Four princi∣pal Streets crossing each other do divide the City as it were into Four equal Parts, every one of which is adorned with several publick Buildings.</P>
<P>In the higher Part of the City the Cathedral Church stands, com∣monly called St. <HI>Mungo</HI>'s. It amazes the Eyes of the Beholders for its stupendious Bigness, and Artifice of its Structure. It consists of two Churches, of which the one is over the other. The several Rows of Pillars, and exceeding high Towers, do show a wonderful piece of Ar∣chitecture.</P>
<P>Near to the Church is the Archbishop's Castle, fenced with an ex∣ceeding high Wall of hewen Stone, and looks down to the City; but the chief Ornament of the City is the College which was founded by King <HI>James</HI> the II. Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> the V. granting an Indulgence, and confirming it by his Bull to have the Rights and Liberties of a Col∣lege, where general Learning should be taught. It was erected by the great Labour and Expences of that Reverend Prelate <HI>William Turn∣bull</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>The Words of the Bull for the founding of it, are, That general Stu∣dy should flourish in the same, as well in Theology, and the Canon and Civil Law, as in all other Arts and Faculties; and that the Masters and Teachers there should enjoy all and sundry the Privileges, Liberties, Honours, Immunities and Exemptions which have been granted by the Apostolick See, or others, any other way, to the Masters, Teachers, or Students of our College at <HI>Bononia.</HI> The Fabrick of the College is remarkable, consisting of divers Courts. The fore-part of it towards the City is of an excellent Structure being of hewen Stone. The Pre∣cincts of the College are enlarged by some Acres of Ground, purcha∣sed by some Money granted to it of late by the King and Estates of the Kingdom. It is separated from the rest of the Town by an ex∣ceeding high Wall.</P>

<HEAD> Old ABERDEEN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ABERDEEN</HI> the Old is situated a Mile to the North of the New Town, commonly called <HI>Bon-accord,</HI> it hath its Name from its Situation, being placed at the Mouth of the Water of <HI>Don.</HI> The Name of the River sufficiently shews that the <HI>Picts</HI> who inhabited this part of the Country were of a <HI>Scythian</HI> Descent, for the River which by the <HI>Latins</HI> is called <HI>Danubius,</HI> by the <HI>Germans</HI> is called <HI>Dunave,</HI> by the <HI>Polonians Dunaum,</HI> by the <HI>Turks Tuna,</HI> being of the very same Name with our <HI>Don.</HI></P>
<P>The River is remarkable for the Multitude of Salmon and Perches which are taken in it. About half a Mile from Old <HI>Aberdeen</HI> it hath a Bridge of one single Arch, which is both large and stately, it is made up for the most part of square hewen Stone, both the Ends of it being fixed on Rocks. By its crooked winding it breaks the force of the Stream, so that Nature it self seems to have made way for its Situa∣tion. A little below it <HI>Don</HI> enters into the Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="21"/>Above the Bridge two Miles, is a heap of Stone artificially cast in the Mouth of the Chanal for the easier catching of the Salmon. It is the Bishops Seat, and hath a Cathedral Church commonly called St. <HI>Ma∣chars,</HI> of a large and stately Structure; being built of hewn Stone by the several Bishops of that See. It anciently consisted of two Ranks of Stone Pillars, another cross Church and three Turrets, the greatest of which, was the Steeple, which was set upon Four Pillars of vaulted Works. In the Church likewise was a Library, but about the Year 1560 it was almost wholly destroyed, so that the Ruines do now only remain.</P>
<P>But the Chief Ornament of this Town is the King's College, pla∣ced on the South side of the Town, conspicuous beyond the rest of the Houses for the Neatness and Stateliness of its Structure. 'Tis In∣feriour to no College in <HI>Scotland.</HI> One side of it is covered with Slate, the rest with Lead; the Church, and Turret or Steeple are of hewen Stone. The Windows were of old remarkable for painted Glass, and some reliques of their ancient Splendor do yet remain. Here is a fine Monument of Bishop <HI>Elphingston.</HI> The Steeple besides others hath two Bells of an extraordinary Bigness. The Top of it is vaulted with a double cross Arch, above which is a King's Crown, having eight Corners upheld by as many Pillars of Stone, a round Globe of Stone with two gilded Crosses closing the Crown. In the Year 1631 it was overturned by a Storm, but shortly after was built in a more stately Form. It was begun by Bishop <HI>Forbes,</HI> continued by <HI>William Gourdon</HI> Dr. of Physick, and helped on by the largesses of several Noblemen and Gentlemen of that Country. Close to the Church there is a Library provided with many Books, much enriched by those which Dr. <HI>Henry Scougal,</HI> Professor of Divinity there, and the Right Reverend Dr. <HI>Patr. Scougal,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> his Father, did lately bequeath to it.</P>
<P>This College was Founded by Bishop <HI>Elphingston, Anno Dom.</HI> 1500. and the greatest part of the Work was likewise Built by him; but King <HI>James</HI> the IV. assumed the Patronage of it to himself, whence it is called the King's College. In it there is a Primar or Principal, a Pro∣fessor of Theology, a Professor of the Civil Law, a Professor of Phy∣sick, a Sub-Principal, who is also a Professor of Philosophy, three other Philosophy Professors, and a Professor of the Languages. This College and that in the New Town make up one University, called the Uni∣versity of King <HI>Charles.</HI></P>

<HEAD>New ABERDEEN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ABERDEEN,</HI> as I have said, is twofold, the New Town and the Old. They are distant the one from the other about a Mile. <HI>Abredonia</HI> seems to be the same which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calls the City <HI>Devana,</HI> placed in the Province called <HI>Texale,</HI> upon the mouth of the River <HI>Dee</HI>; for <HI>Aber</HI> in the old <HI>British</HI> Tongue signifies or denotes the mouth of a River, and <HI>Deva,</HI> or <HI>Dee,</HI> is the name of the River upon whose mouth this City is situated. But New <HI>Aberdeen</HI> is the Capital of the Sheriff∣dom of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and the Seat of the Sheriff for Trial of Causes. It is placed at the Eastern Corner of the Shire, where it is wash'd with the <HI>German</HI> Sea. This City very much exceeds the rest of the Cities of the North of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Bigness, greatness of Traffick, and Beauty; it en∣joys a wholesome Air, and abounds with well-bred Inhabitants, and has a great Revenue from its Salmon fishing. The Old City seems to have been placed upon a Bank of the Sea; because it is the common Opinion that the Monastery of the Holy Trinity which is thought to have been formerly the Palace of King <HI>William,</HI> is situate in the very Creek of that Sea, and not far from it are the Ruins of an old <HI>Praetorium.</HI> In tract of time the Inhabitants seem to have filled several neighbouring little Hills with Houses, and now the City is chiefly built upon Three of those Hills, and the greatest part upon the highest. It hath an access by an ascent every way. The exteriour parts thereof are spread out upon the Plain, as Suburbs in many places.</P>
<P>That there was a Mint heretofore in the City, appears by Silver Coyns there stamped with this Inscription, <HI>Ʋrbs Aberdeae,</HI> which are yet pre∣served in the Closets of the curious.</P>
<P>The Streets are Paved with Flint, or a very hard Stone resembling Flint; the Houses beautiful both within and without, are Four Stories high, or more, and have for the most part Gardens and Orchards be∣longing to them; so that the whole City, to those that approach it, gives the resemblance of a Wood.</P>
<P>At the West-End of the City, a little round Hill adjoyning offers it self to sight, from the foot of which Hill breaks forth a Fountain of clear Water, and in the middle of the same, another Spring flowing down to the foot of the Hill, bubbles out, and sends forth a Stream as
<PB N="30" REF="22"/>
rapid as a Torrent, but the spring it self is easily distinguish'd both in Colour and Taste from a Torrent. It is called the <HI>Aberdonian</HI> Spaw, because both in Taste and Quality it comes very near to the Spaw Water in the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege.</HI> This Water is cold to the touch. Doctor <HI>William Barclay</HI> a Physician, has written a Treatise concerning it.</P>
<P>In the High Street there is a Church of the <HI>Franciscans</HI> worthy to be taken notice of, built of Free-Stone; a Work begun by Doctor <HI>William Elphingston,</HI> then Bishop, and finished at the charge of <HI>Gavinus Dumbar,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> about the Year of Christ 1500.</P>
<P>The said Bishop <HI>Gavinus Dumbar,</HI> hath also got himself immor∣tal Honour, by a Famous Bridge of seven Arches laid over the River <HI>Dee,</HI> about a Mile from the City, built very firm and durable, of Free-Stone, which in more places than one by Inscription testifies its Author or Builder.</P>
<P>But the great Ornament of the City is its College, called the <HI>Mare∣shallian Academy,</HI> as founded by the Earl Marshal, <HI>George Keith,</HI> in the Year 1593, which the City of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> hath very much adorned with several additional Buildings. It has, besides a Primary Professor, who is called Principal, Four Professors of Philosophy, a Professor of Theology, and a Professor of the Mathematicks. There is also a famous Library Founded by the City of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> supplied by the Gifts of Learned Men, and furnished with divers Mathematical Instruments.</P>
<P>Add to these the School-House, Founded by Dr. <HI>Dune,</HI> which has one Head Master, and three Ushers under him. There is also a School for Musick.</P>
<P>The Cathedral Church nominated from St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> its Patron, is built of Free-Stone and covered with Lead; has a Steeple resembling a Py∣ramid, and covered likewise with sheets of Lead to a considerable heighth. It was divided formerly into Three Churches, the bigest whereof was cal∣led the Old Church, the other the New Church, and the third the Arched, named the Arch of the Lady of Mercy. This Cathedral is propt with Pillars of Free-Stone, and has Three Bells of a vast weight, which by their quick and continual Sounds divide the half Hours. The body of this Church is adorned with a Tower and pinacled Steeple. Here is kept the Court for the publick Trials of the Townsmen, and the County Courts, where is also a Prison and a Work-House. Besides these there is an Alms-House for the maintenance of the Old People of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> that are come to Decay, with Three Hospitals Founded by several persons. And adjoyning to the Custom-House lies the Port or Wharf.</P>

The most curious Part of the Building is the Vault of the Quire, and that which is called the Prince's Pillar so much talk'd of. This Chapel was possess'd by a Provost, and Seven Canons Regular, who were endued with several considerable Revenues through the Liberality of the Lairds of <HI>Roslin.</HI></P>
