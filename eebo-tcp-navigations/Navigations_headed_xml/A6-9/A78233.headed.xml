<P>And it appearing by the foregoing Scheme, that what his Majesty was pleased to design as encouragement to the said Officers, has been detrimental, yet they were easy under it, in expe∣ctation of the promised Benefit of half Pay whilst out of Employment; and it is hoped this Ho∣nourable House will take their Case into their most mature Consideration, and do (as they al∣ways have) promote the Honour of his Majesty, the Good of their Country, and Welfare of those who have ventured their Lives to make this Kingdom Happy; which the preserving of Officers to serve upon any Emergency will undoubtedly do, especially if it be considered how fatal the want of them was likely to be in the beginning of the late War, and the encourage∣ment given in Peace to other Captains abroad.</P>
