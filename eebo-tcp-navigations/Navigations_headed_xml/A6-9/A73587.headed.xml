<PB REF="4"/> thing of greater importāce dyd pluck me away from it, and so I leue it of.</P>
<P>But now men shal vnderstād at this tyme the greatest, the most wōderful &amp; most horrible thinge that euer was herde of. The which partli hath so tro¦bled y<SUP>e</SUP> greate Turke. and al the reste, that the haue left of al other affaires, to prouyde for the peril &amp; danger that at this time hangeth ouer their heade &amp; carieth them. Newes are come that the kyng of Spayne waketh a greate armye, which shal haue for his eide y<SUP>e</SUP> Galeys of Gene of Malte, of Florēce of Naple, &amp; of mani other Princes of christendome. And they sai more ouer that the king of France wil help ther¦in, and that the most part of Christiā Prynces wyll come and ayde hym in this enterprice, except the most noble state &amp; Sinorie of venyce which med∣deleth nothing at all it. These repor∣ters of newes affirme that there shall more thē a hundreth galeys, besyde o∣ther Barkes Shippes and Hulkes w<SUP>t</SUP> out nōber, which is occasion that thei hast the armye the more. The whiche thyng not withstandyng men esteme not so much as the ware that is made beyond the Mountaynes, as you shal vnderstand not wythout gret wonde¦ring
<PB REF="5"/> at it. The Tartares make freen¦des vpon the greter sea &amp; haue made a leage and frendshippe with y<SUP>e</SUP> great Turke, requiringe ayde, for they are molested with warre by y<SUP>e</SUP> gret duke of Moscouia, and prince of Sagodie, of Pogore, of Smo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egye, of Drossye, of Gazam, of Virg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, of Cerea∣rie, of cham, of Bieracham, lateli got¦ten of the Cirenssiens, and of diuers other people and regions lyenge to∣ward the South. They say that this emperour or duke hath two armyes, and is called Iho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tillo, a yong mā of the age of .xxiiii. yeares, noble and valiaunt, and a christiā after the institucion of the Grekes, and presu∣meth that by reason of his bloude the empire of Constātinople doth belōg to him. And these two armies are a∣bout a two hundred thousand horse. They were not wont in time past to be so stronge, nor so feared of y<SUP>e</SUP> Tur∣kes, for they had not the vse of artilla∣rie in the warre. But now they haue maruaylous great preparaciō their warre. He hathe in wages certayne Duch capitaynes. And aboute a ten thousand maister gonners, &amp; is mer¦uelous well furneshed with harkebu¦ses &amp; artillery. And because mē vnder¦stand that he hath so drest y<SUP>e</SUP> Tartari∣ēs
<PB REF="5"/> &amp; brought them to such a state that the cā not much more resist him. And that if y<SUP>t</SUP> sayde Moscouites shoulde be maisters ouer y<SUP>e</SUP> Tartares the should consequentli be rulers of the greater sea, &amp; the way should be opē and easy for them to come, not only to Constā¦tinople, but also to dryue y<SUP>e</SUP> turke out of Europe. And because that the said great Turke is assured of this enter∣pryse and commociō of the Greekes, he hath concluded &amp; deteermined, to sēd to they sayd Tartares a good assy¦staunce of fiftene thousand fightinge men &amp; also for this purpose he hathe sent to the sea, tē galeyes to passe thē ouer. Men make menciō and dought of Mōdatcio, which is a great prince and rular, &amp; able to make fourscore or a hundred thousand horse. And yet mē are vncertaine whose part he wil take, because he is tributar: vnto the great Turke. Ther is newes also frō Affrica, that the king of Bugien, the king of Tramece, the king of Tunts the children of Serit. The lorde of Murocho &amp; of Gran with the Arra∣bians and other haue takē in hād to driue and expulse the turke holly out of Affrica, and to endomage the sayd turke as much as the may. Mē know not well yet in what place they wyll warre. But we shal know it shortely
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/> The newys also is that y<SUP>e</SUP> Soffy is in Campe with a great army, and hath the Medes to helpe him which border vpon the Caspian Sea, and of on side neighbour to y<SUP>e</SUP> Hyreās, called at this daye Correxans and Necotans, with whō he hath made a League &amp; peace. And ther are on hys syde also the Ibe¦ians, and Albanians, and also the peo¦ple of Melibax whych border vpō the Yndians, and likewise with the king of Bosphorus, all beyng peple merue¦lous swift &amp; nymble. In this so migh∣ty an host and armie is also Baicey y<SUP>e</SUP> sōne of the great Turke, By meanes wherof, all in those partes is in grate trouble, as well as here, It seemeth y<SUP>t</SUP> the Genyssaryes bring him the lot of Turki, as Baduget, Nermonia, Ale∣po, and al the Region lyeng nere to y<SUP>e</SUP> Soffe is reuolted, Al the which parti∣cularites shalbe vnderstode moore at large. This newes is great, and hath made y<SUP>e</SUP> great Turke to muse inough vpō it. But aboue all these maruelus and dreadfull newes which ar happe¦ned ther is yet chaūced another whi∣ch hath sered &amp; a bashed generally all mē which neuerthelesse seemeth to be incredible. And yet it is most certaine &amp; that is, that a people here to fore vn∣knowen,
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/> myghty, swifte, and merue∣lous nymble, hath taken weapō ī hād to the dysaduantage &amp; losse of y<SUP>e</SUP> howse of Ottoman. They say that Alexāder the great did ī tyme past dryue beyōd the Mountayne Caspe nyne trybes &amp; a halfe of the Hebrewes wich worshi∣ped the Calfe and Serpēt of gold, and draue them a waye, y<SUP>t</SUP> neuer sins there was no newes of them, nether knewe any man yf thei were in the worlde or not. But bycause the sea of Sand or y<SUP>e</SUP> sandy sea, By a certaine incōueniēce of sād Grauell or Beche, swelled and rose so high y<SUP>t</SUP> it vtterly toke from thē the wai into this our regiō. But now by the meane of the newe Nauigaciō that the Spaneardes haue made, thei ar ariued in their country, and haue espied out al their doynges. And after that the said Spaniardes had instruc¦ted and taught them they science and knowledge of artyllerye, &amp; gon poul∣der for Harkebuses &amp; Dagges wher¦vnto there horses ar maruelous apt &amp; ready, the are becō in al thinges verye parfyt. After this, the egged them for warde to take weapon in hand and to passe y<SUP>e</SUP> sayde Mountain by land. And bycause the sea of sand o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sandy se dyd hynder th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r passage, it appereth
<PB REF="7" MS="y"/> y<SUP>t</SUP> some Spaniard or Italien, which yet men know not, but not withstan¦ding, some great Astrologian or Cos¦mographer taught thē y<SUP>e</SUP> way makīg some hill playne with her, so that the made thē selues a wai veriely, which is a thīg of great wonder. Now these peple haue two mighty great armies &amp; infinite victuals, they coūtrey beīg very fertyle &amp; fruitful, &amp; also almaner of preporaciō for warre, &amp; there are Spaniardes amōg them so wel exer∣cised in the feate of Artillerye, as hād gōnes and dagges. that is a wonder. And they saye, that they wyll come &amp; recouer y<SUP>e</SUP> lande of promise, towarde the which the first armi is already ve¦ri nere, not without great terror and dread of euery man, which hath bene sene of dyuers &amp; nombred, and final∣ly report to the great turke, bothe the number and quātitee as you shal vn∣derstand here folowing.</P>
<P>The spies say, not only one, but ma∣ny, that would see and vnderstand al thinges, that the Saugiatari whiche border vpon them &amp; are their neigh∣bours wryte &amp; testifie, that besyde a hundred and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o armyes ther folow other infinit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people, as wel fotemen, as horsemen, and y<SUP>t</SUP> first armye is al∣redy

And because mē speake of it much heare: I wyll not forget to speake also some thing therof worthi to be noted, and wel vnderstode. The Hebreues of Constātinoble saye that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>atie certayne prophesies amōg the whyche the one maketh mencion that from the fower parte of y<SUP>e</SUP> world shall ryse a people and come īto Gog &amp; Magog, and then shall appeare (as they perswade them selues ther Mes∣sias in might and power, &amp; then they shall haue domynyon and rule in the world, wherof they secretly reioyce &amp; are wonderous glad. They say more ouer that ther is a Prophesie grauē ī a pillar set at Podromo, which saith thus. A mighty prince shall rise, whose beginning shall be of small re∣putacion, but he shall ware of suche force and strengthe (with the helpe of god (that he shal bring to nothing the empire and rule of Ottoman, &amp; shall be the righte possessour and inhery∣tour of y<SUP>e</SUP> empire of Constantinoble.
