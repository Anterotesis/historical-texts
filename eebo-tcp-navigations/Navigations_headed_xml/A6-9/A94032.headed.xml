<HEAD>The wonder of the World, <HI>Or the Great</HI> GYANT DESCRIBED.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE strange Report of this Monsterous Huge <HI>Gyant</HI> hath filled all Ears with Wonder and Amazement; that such <HI>Men</HI> have been in former times, is undeni∣able; but that such should be in these last <HI>Times</HI> of the World, might seem not on∣ly very inrredible, but also Wonderfull to the hearers or beholders of all such Monsters, as this is Reported to be; But before I come to describe him, let me a little reflect upon former times, and of the Men of those dayes, that the present <HI>relation</HI> we have in hand may gain the more likelyhood of truth.</P>
<P>That learned Author <HI>Varro,</HI> writeth of one <HI>Tritamio,</HI> a Fencer at <HI>Rome,</HI> of such exceeding strength, that being bound hand and foot with massie Chains, he would wrestle with the strongest men that could be found, pushing their bodyes from one side to another, he giving such a deadly
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>blow, that if he but touched one of them, they were in great danger of their Lives; his Son was no whit inferior, for being a Souldier under <HI>Pompey,</HI> fought alwayes naked, armed with nothing but what <HI>Nature</HI> had furnished him withall, namely his <HI>Fiests</HI> and <HI>Nayles,</HI> and if he touched but any one with his little finger, he made him yeeld, and brought him Prisoner to the Campe; the <HI>Sinews</HI> of these two, were not onely at length like other men, but onely athwart, and crosse-wise over all their whole Body, from whence (as the <HI>Sages</HI> observe) proceeded this their so mi∣raculous strength.</P>
<P><HI>Elan</HI> writeth of a <HI>Gyant</HI> named <HI>Tritormo,</HI> of such mighty Puissance and strength, that <HI>Milo</HI> (another <HI>Gyant</HI>) thinking his great Fame would be ecclipsed by the Report of the others strength, and unconquered Valour; that <HI>Milo</HI> made no more adoe, but sent him a <HI>Challenge,</HI> which was gladly accepted by <HI>Tritormo,</HI> and the Day appointed to Fight, the Combitants being no sooner entred into Fight, But <HI>Tritormo</HI> catching up a mighty cleft of a huge <HI>Rock,</HI> which was impossible for any Humane force to move, casting it from him three or four times, with such exceeding force, and then lifting it up upon his Soulder, carried it so farre, that <HI>Milo</HI> trembling and amazed at the strangnesse thereof, cryed out;</P>
<P><HI>Oh JƲPITER! Is it possible that thou hast brought another</HI> Hercules <HI>into the World?</HI></P>
<P>And so declining the Ingagement, without more adoe, yeilded unto him; thinking it honor enough for him to wait upon him, and become his servant till his Death; these had both the Pipes of their Armes and Leggs doubled, their bones being whole, firm and sound, either without hollownesse or <HI>Marrow,</HI> which caused them to be of greater force and strength; and which is most Remarkable, They never suffere Thirst, nor at any time was it ever observed that they sweat.</P>
<P><HI>Solinus</HI> writeth, that <HI>Hercules</HI> himself was but Seven <HI>Foot</HI> high, and all the rest of his <HI>Body proportionable.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
<P>He mentioneth also two <HI>Gyants</HI> that lived in the time of <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> the one named <HI>Puston,</HI> the other <HI>Secundila,</HI> who were Ten <HI>foot</HI> high apiece; their <HI>bones</HI> are now to be seen in the <HI>Ossary</HI> of the <HI>Salustians:</HI> Another <HI>Gyant</HI> was a∣bout this time in <HI>Arabia,</HI> called <HI>Gauara,</HI> who was Nine <HI>foot</HI> and 9 <HI>Inches</HI> long, the rest of his body proportionable. The <HI>Bones</HI> of <HI>Orestes</HI> found at <HI>Tegoea,</HI> which being measured, were found 7 Cubits long, which is more then four yeards. In the time that <HI>Sartorius</HI> remained Captain General over the <HI>Romane</HI> Army at <HI>Athens,</HI> he caused the Sepulchre of a <HI>Gy∣ant</HI> to be opened, and his bones to be measured, the length of his Carcasse was found to be 70 Cubits, which was seen to the great admiration of all the <HI>Romane</HI> Hoste.</P>
<P><HI>Bergamo</HI> writeth of a Sepulchre, wherein was found a Body of admirable greatness, outreaching as it were in length the high Walls or Buildings, he seemed as if he lay sleeping, having wounds upon him Four <HI>Foot wide;</HI> at his <HI>Bolster</HI> stood a <HI>Lampe</HI> burning, which would not go out till a <HI>hole</HI> was made in the <HI>Bottome</HI> thereof, which being done, it suddenly extinguished; and the Body, so soon as touched turned into Powder and Ashes, about this Tombe was written in <HI>Greek</HI> Letters, <HI>Pallas, Son of Evander, slaine by Tur∣nus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Bocacius</HI> writeth, That in the City of <HI>Trapana,</HI> cer∣tain Labourers digging of <HI>Chalke</HI> at the foot of a Hill, dis∣covered a <HI>Cave</HI> of wonderous widenesse, in which was a <HI>Light burning,</HI> in the midst whereof sate a man of Monster∣ous bigness, holding a Saffe as big as the greatest Mast of a ship; they being much affrighted with the fight, runne to the next Town amazed, and raised all the People, who arming themselves, came with <HI>Light Torches</HI> to the <HI>Cave,</HI> where finding he did not stir, they laid hands on him, who so soon as touch'd fell into Ashes, the bones also remain∣ing, which being measured, his Carcasse was found to be 140 Cubits long, his skull holding two heaped Bushells of <HI>Wheate.</HI> But these were all but <HI>Dwarfs</HI> to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Gyant;</HI> the truest <HI>Description</HI> of him, take from that sage Philosopher <HI>Democritus,</HI> who limmeth him forth thus.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>This Monsterous Gyant was taken by an <HI>English</HI> Merchant in a certain Iland in <HI>America</HI> called <HI>Nera,</HI> as two ships were taking in <HI>fresh-water,</HI> they seeing this Monsterous Gyant make towards them, with a great <HI>Oake</HI> in his hand, fled all to their shallop or long-Boat, and so made away to their Ship, much amazed at the sight of so monsterous a Man; He standing some little time on the shoar looking after them, and so returned some distance up again into the I∣land; Whereupon the Captain comanded 3 <HI>Butts</HI> of <HI>Sacke,</HI> and a Rundlet of <HI>Strong-Waters,</HI> to be placed on the shoare, and set an end, and the heads of them to be knock'd out, and so to return a <HI>Ship-board</HI> againe, which done, the next Morning they perceived the Gyant come stalking down to the shoare, and smelling the <HI>Sack,</HI> he took up a Butt as easi∣ly as one would take up a Cup from the Table, and at one draught drunk it all off, and so went to the next, and did the like, but at the third Butt he made two draughts, and so falling down, set the <HI>Strong-waters</HI> to his mouth, turning it up as easily as one would do a <HI>Gill,</HI> which Strong-wa∣ter so intoxicated his head, That he fell into a dead sleep; whereupon the Captain sent out a Shallop, with 30 of the lustiest Marriners, with Chains to binde him, and so with Cranes and Pullyes to get him into the Shallop, which with difficulty they effected, yet not without great dan∣ger of sinking their shallop with his extraordinary <HI>weight,</HI> having him at the Ship-side, opened the Decks, halled him up by Ropes and Pullyes, and so <HI>loared</HI> him down into the <HI>Hole,</HI> where he slept sweetly among the <HI>Sand</HI> 24 houres after, during which time, they had taken off his <HI>chains,</HI> and bound him hand and foot with new Ropes and Cables, and so making fast the <HI>Ballast-room</HI> left him lying along (as in a Coffin) all the length of the Ship; and so, having a fair wind, sailed about a hundred Leagues from the Iland be∣fore he awaked, who perceiving himself intangled, stretch∣ing out his Limbs; cracked assunder the <HI>Ropes,</HI> as easily as one of us would doe a <HI>twine-thread,</HI> yet could not by reason of his length rise up; they feeding him through a
<PB N="7" REF="4"/><HI>hole,</HI> by degrees have in some sort civiliz'd and tamed him; he is 19 foot and a half high, 9 foot broad in the Shoul∣ders, his head is four yeards and a quartern about, his neck 2 yeards, and the Calves of his leggs as bigg; his Nose is 13 inches long <HI>London measure,</HI> it being about a yeard between each Eye, the hollow of his nostrills being just the com∣passe of the Muzzle of a <HI>Drake,</HI> and his Eyes as bigg as rea∣sonable Sawcers; he will easily put a shoulder of <HI>Mutton</HI> in his mouth at a bitt; his Keeper, since he came to <HI>Portsmouth</HI> putting in a 24 pound piece of raw Beef through the <HI>hole</HI> to him, the Gyant being hungry, and snapping eagerly at it, bit off his Keepers hand, just by the elbow, making no bones of it, which makes them ever since more wary of him; he is suddenly expected at the <HI>Mouth</HI> at <HI>Aldergate,</HI> which Place (being large) is now taking up for him; Three <HI>sales-men</HI> on <HI>Snow hill</HI> have hired 30 Tailors to make him a pair of Breeches and Doublet, the Cloath whereof, being 38 yeards of Broad-Cloath, at 11. s. the yeard; and a <HI>Felt∣maker</HI> in <HI>Greens Rents</HI> hath bought an old Copper of the Brasier at <HI>Holburn-Conduit,</HI> to boyle his <HI>Felt</HI> in, the crown of which Hat will hold 3 bushells of <HI>Wheate,</HI> there being in the Brims and all, about a Todd and a half of <HI>Wooll;</HI> the Kings <HI>Sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-maker</HI> in St. <HI>Martins,</HI> having bought the last Monday in <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> 7 <HI>Dicker</HI> of <HI>Leather</HI> to make him a pair of <HI>Boots</HI> and a pair of <HI>Shooes,</HI> there being a large <HI>back</HI> in one <HI>sowle,</HI> and 2 <HI>hides</HI> in an <HI>upper Leather,</HI> Squire <HI>Bugge</HI> is to take <HI>measure</HI> of his <HI>foot,</HI> and to <HI>cut them out,</HI> and <HI>liquor</HI> them; twenty Ells of <HI>Lockrum</HI> will but make him one <HI>shirt,</HI> his <HI>Stockings</HI> being full as bigg, but longer then a <HI>Quarter-Sack,</HI> and his Garters 12 yeards long, comming but twice about his legge, all the <HI>Fees</HI> at the <HI>Slaughter-house</HI> on Tower Hill are bespoak to feed him; and 3 Carpenters hired by the Merchants that own him, to goe and cut down the Great <HI>Elme</HI> at <HI>Hamsted</HI> to make him a <HI>Pick-tooth;</HI> Some re∣port, that a certain rich <HI>Jew</HI> hath bought <HI>Powls</HI> to keep him in, where he intends to <HI>show</HI> him to the People, because the <HI>Mouth Inn</HI> at <HI>Alders-gate</HI> is measured, and found <HI>too lit∣tle</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>to hold him; the great <HI>Oliphant</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> is sent for over, to bring him thorow the City, as he passes thorow <HI>Cheap-side,</HI> Two men are to be placed on the top of <HI>Bow-Steeple,</HI> with two great <HI>Ladles</HI> fastned upon <HI>Poles,</HI> to reach him <HI>Sack</HI> to drink, and two more with great <HI>Shovells</HI> to fling <HI>Sugar-plumns</HI> into his <HI>mouth;</HI> 24 men have underta∣ken to feed him on the side Galleries on top of <HI>Pauls,</HI> one standing with a <HI>Scoop</HI> to fling in <HI>salt</HI> after every mouthfull of <HI>meat</HI> he takes, 40 <HI>Fat Oxen</HI> being roasted for his Dinner, and 100 sheep for his <HI>Supper,</HI> two Tun of <HI>Wine,</HI> and Three <HI>Hoggs-heads</HI> of <HI>Beer</HI> to a meal, and this is to welcome him into the <HI>City;</HI> thus he is to be feasted for 6 Dayes, and the Seventh, four <HI>Presbyterian Priests</HI> are to say <HI>Grace,</HI> and af∣terwards to use all the possible means they can to <HI>Convert</HI> him from Paganisme, and so he is to goe to <HI>Broken-wharf,</HI> where the <HI>Priests</HI> are to stand by the <HI>Windmill</HI> on the top of the <HI>Water-House,</HI> and to <HI>sprinkle</HI> him with <HI>Holy-water</HI> drawn up by Horses for that purpose, and afterwards he is to pull off his <HI>stockings,</HI> and to <HI>wade</HI> up the <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> and back again, that all the Citizens may behold him, as he goes and comes back, all the <HI>Chambers</HI> are to be dis∣charged at the <HI>Bank-end</HI> and upon <HI>Tower-Hill;</HI> Some affirm, that the <HI>Hgogs-fac'd Gentle-woman</HI> is sent for out of <HI>Holland</HI> to be his god-mother; and litte <HI>Jeffry</HI> the Great <HI>Turk</HI> from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to be his godfather; but this is only report; when he is christned, and all this performed you shall hear more, untill which time, I shall forbear any further <HI>Infor∣mation</HI> or Discription of this Monsterous <HI>Gyant;</HI> In the mean time, take this for the most truest <HI>Relation.</HI></P>
