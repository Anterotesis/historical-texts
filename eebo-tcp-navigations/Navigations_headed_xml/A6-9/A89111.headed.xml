<HEAD>A MESSAGE Sent to Admiral Vantrump From The High and Mighty Lords the States General of the Vnited Provinces.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Lord Paw, Embassadour extraordinary from the States General of the United Provinces, hath made a large report to his Masters, touching his Embassie to the Common-wealth of England, since which he hath sent a messenger to the Parliament to gra∣tifie the respects and civilities used by them towards him,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>he also assures them, that in all probability, the States will send yet another messenger. Upon his report, and a mo∣tion by him made to that purpose, the States have sent a Message to the Lievt. Admiral Vantrump, wherein <HI>They expressely charge, require, and forbid him, or any of the Fleet under his command, to meddle with, hinder, or disturb by any hostile act, any English ship whatsoever, not offering injury or affront to them; but to let them passe freely without let or molestation, untill they have made their full resolutions, touching the report made by the Lord Embassa∣dour Paw.</HI> So that all hopes of a peace with England is not quite taken away, notwithstanding the strong endea∣vors of a hot spirited party among us, who desire nothing more then to see the two nations imbroyled in a cruel and bloudy war.</P>
<P>The people notwithstanding are arming every where, and every <HI>Stadt</HI> re-inforced both with Cavalry and Infan∣try; even the Hague it self is made a garrison; and all ships fit for service are stopt and entertained, although the men have small stomacks to engage with your men of war, who they know want not courage to receive and en∣tertain them; many of the East-India Fleet are rigging and preparing for war, that Company apprehending, that if matters go not according to their expectation, they shal be called to an account for the businesse of Amboina: and for the defence of our frontier towns, we have sent abroad to forraign Princes to assist us, who will (no doubt) be as ready to supply us, as we to desire their aid, though but to serve their own ends.</P>
<P>Much scuffling there is among the States, for the ma∣king the young Prince of Orange Governour, and very violently hath the motion been followed by all the Pro∣vinces, Holland onely excepted, which strongly apposeth it: Count William hath been named for Lievt. General;
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>but many fear if this motion should take effect, he would introduce forraign forces amongst us, and so betray our liberty, having the D. of Brandenburgh, and the Grave of Embden his brothers. But while these things were in deep consultation at the Hague, the element of fire raged in this City in a double misfortune both on the water and on the land: on the water we had a new ship fired, how, or by what means we cannot certainly learn, but this I am sure of, that if great pains and industry had not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n used for the speedy extinguishing thereof, it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣lihood have fired and burnt our fire ships, which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lay near them, but are since gone out to our Fleet. To se∣cond this, the State-house of this City was sudd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly fired and burnt down to the ground, we having as little k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣ledge of the author or cause of this as of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Many there was that cried out Treason, Treason, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conjecturing it could be nothing else, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that envied the glory and riches of that City, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e out of malice done it; however much they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow to heaven that there was so little wind, had the wind been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh, the pride of this City had been laid in the dust. Much o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Bank-money lay in that place; and is melted to the great grief (no doubt) of those that laid it for security and pro∣fit in that place; generally the people still continue high in their language, and seem loth to trust those English that so faithfully served them against the Spaniard, but rather rely upon such forraign auxiliaries, as it is belie∣ved will rather seek the way to ruine us, thereby to ad∣vantage themselves, then endeavour to put a period to our troubles.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the Downs, containing a full and perfect Narrative of Admiral Vantrumps facing of Sir George Ascue with a Fleet of above an hundred Sail.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours of the 12 instant, wherein you de∣sire to be informed touching the transactions betwixt our Fleet under Sir George Ascue, and the Dutch un∣der Vantrump; for your satisfaction take this accompt. Some of the Scouts Sir Geo. Ascue had sent out, retur∣ned the 8 of this instant July, declaring that they had de∣scried above 60 sail of Dutchmen in the Downs, Sir George then riding with part of his Fleet near Deal Ca∣stle, the other part was in the Hope, intending towards him. The enemy seemed to design an interception of that party, and then to fight Sir George. But Sir Geo know∣ing they were not well provided for fight, sent to them, commanding them to continue there till he should send them further Order; and with those he had (being not 20 sail) he resolved to fight it out, what ever Fleet should attempt to engage him, and prepared himself in the best manner he could to receive them, howbeit there was no attempt made upon him that night nor the next day, du∣ring which time he received aboard him 200 foot soul∣diers, distributing them among his Fleet.</P>
<P>On Saturday the Dutch came in sight, we conceived them to be about an hundred and two Men of War, and ten or twelve fire ships; they were divided into 3 squa∣drons, viz. 35 sail with the Admiral on the back of the
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>Goodwin; Three leagues Eastward of him was another squadron consisting of 40 sail, and the third at Longsands-head, which lay in a posture to intercept our ships as aforesaid, and to keep Sir George from steering West∣ward. The next day being Sunday, very early, the intent of the enemy being frustrated, those ships which were comming forth being returned into the River according to Order, he divided his Fleet into two parts, the greatest part (consisting of about 75 sail) bore up directly to∣wards Sir George between the Brake head, and North sands head, whilest the rest of the Fleet, being about 35 sail, lay upon the back of the Goodwin, to intercept Sir George, if their Fire-ships should constrain him to quit his anchors. But the Tide of Ebb being done, and but lit∣tle wind, the enemy was compelled to anchor about a league distant from our Fleet, expecting the opportuni∣ty of the next Tide of Ebb to fall upon Sir George, who knowing that both his Officers, Mariners and Souldiers were filled with courage and resolution, prepared him∣self for their reception. In the mean time six peeces of Ordnance were mounted on two Platforms between tween the Castles of Deal and Sandown, which might annoy the enemy if he should engage; The Militia of the Countrey, both horse and foot, were also on their march thitherwards.</P>
<P>Whilest all things were thus disposed, and our soul∣diers both Seamen and Landmen, with great chearfulness and courage attended the falling on of the enemy, the wind turned, so that the Dutch could not come in as they intended, and at Ebb it came to South-west, which was very disadvantageous to the enemy, who finding that pro∣vidence fought against them, weighed, and stood back a∣gain to the back of the Goodwin about 5 a clock, where meeting altogether, they steered away.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P>I cannot omit to tell you, that above two hundred Seamen, to shew their good affection and zeal to the Par∣liament, came voluntarily and freely in to assist our Fleet, there were also divers fire-ships preparing at Dover, to be made use of for entertaining of the Hollanders Navy, had they approached any nearer; They thought to have performed Wonders upon our Fleet here in the absence of General Blake, but the Lord was pleased to disappoint them, and bring to nought their Counsels.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>His Excellency Gen. Blake hath been all this while, and is yet Northwards with a very gallant fleet of ships, and some letters I have seen from the North, which say, That there hath been a great Fight between a part of General Blakes Fleet, and the Dutch in the Northern seas, and that Gen. Blake hath taken divers Dutch ships, fishermen and others, but no letters are yet come from his navy to con∣firm it. It was conjectured by many that a squadron of Vantrumps Fleet sailed Northwards, but we understand since that they are all together, and are gone Westward, thinking thereby to draw Gen. Blake from the North.</P>
