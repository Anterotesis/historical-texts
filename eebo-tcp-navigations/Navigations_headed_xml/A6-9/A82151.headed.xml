<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ince our first dayes Engagement with the enemy, it hath pleased the great Omnisciency of Hea∣ven still to crown every days Action with a more glorious Victory; and, truly, very opportunely came in his Excellency Gen. Blake to our assistance, who charged quite through the enemies fleet, on Friday, and made such an intervale amongst their men of war, that many were seen to sink before six in the evening: The dispute was very hot, and performed with great gallantry from ten in the morning til ten at night, by which time, We had taken 1350 prisoners,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>whereof six Captains, 11 ships, sunk six, and fired three; but in all the several En∣gagements we have sunk taken, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d burnt about 40, amongst the rest, the great Ad∣miral of Holland, called he Brederode, in which was Vantrump, but he narrowly e∣scaped out at one of the Port holes in a Cock-Boat. VVe have taken down the Dutch Colours both from the Admiral, and the two Rear admirals, and have set up the English Ensignes, with the States armes.</P>
<P>We have dispierced th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir great Armado, and beaten them into their own Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bours, having al∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um'd the whole Countrey, so that we hear most of the Boors are up in armes.</P>
<P>The States have Ordered that all the Maritine Towns be re-inforced with sundry companies out of the old standing Regiments, that so they may thereby prevent the landing of the English. They have also ordered that the several Sluces be forth∣with put in a readiness, for the letting in of the seas, if necessitated thereunto.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
<P>We hear likewise that the States have set forth a Declaration to be published throughout all the U∣nited Provinces, inciting the Burgomasters, and o∣thers, to a general Convention at the Hague, there to consult upon a way, for a Reconciliation be∣tween the two Republicks. O what is more wished or would be more welcome then peace? What is better or sweeter then peace? what is more splen∣did and beautiful then peace? Peace is that fair <HI>Astraea</HI> that linketh men tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther in the golden fet∣ters of mutuall Amity, and maketh them to live as if their persons being many, their soules were but one. Peace is the harmony of the world, the smile and ferenity of the earth, the hansel and image of our happiness in Heaven, the tut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lar Saint of Kings and Princes, the very form or soul of a Common∣wealth, the Nursery of Arts, shortly, a Paradise where all accommodations for this life and the next do grow.</P>

<HEAD>Another Letter from the Navy, touching the great fight on Sunday and Munday last.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving persued the enemy even to their own Coast upon Friday night, we rode at anchor at six fatham Water, di∣vers of the Dutch rode between 3 and 4, &amp; on Saturday morning expected to have put into harbour; but the Winds were so cross, that We were all forced to stand off to sea, and on the Sabbath day about 6 in the morning, We Weather-gaged them, and came up again, letting fly above 1000 shot at each other; in which dispute, We fired one, and sunk five; but not without some loss; for 'tis impossible that such a Conflict should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> managed with that feli∣city, as for the Conquerors to escape with∣out
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>any head being broken. About 8 in the evening they bare up before the Wind for the Tassel; but could not get in, for Vice-Admiral Pen, with 30 gallant frigats inter∣posed, and so got between them and home. But night approaching, the dispute ended, and the next morning early They tacked about, and thought to have escaped; which General Blake perceiving, immediatly came up to them again; so that another desperate fight began, and for many houres it was furiously disputed; but about three in the afternoon, it pleased God to make us abso∣lute Victors, and to deliver into our hands, many hundreds of the enemy; the rest that escaped are miserably rent and torn, some flying towards Ostend. Others, towards the Wielings, and not 12 left in a compa∣ny. In the last dayes engagement we sunk, seven, and took as many. We laid one of
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>their Admirals aboard five times, and at last carryed her.</P>
<P>The death of General Dean is much lamented, he was shot with a Canon-bullet, at the very first broad side given by the enemy, as he stood flou∣rishing his Sword at the head of his ship, having his Arm taken off by the shot, and his body exceed∣ingly rent and torn.</P>
<P>VVe are now riding upon the Dutch coast, and have sent many hundred shot into the Town of Flushing, and Vice-Admiral Pen still lies at the mouth of the Texel.</P>
