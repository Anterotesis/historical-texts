<HEAD>The Royal PILGRIMAGE Or The PROGRESSE OF King Charles the II.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the last Campagna in <HI>England</HI> at <HI>Naseby</HI> Field, and the Defeat of my Lord <HI>Goring</HI> pre∣sently after at <HI>Lamport,</HI> to which succeeded the Disbanding of my Lord <HI>Hoptons</HI> Army in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> to whom the King had committed the Care of the Prince in that exigence and distresse of Affairs; It was directed by his late Majesty of blessed Memory, that the said Prince should be transported into the Island of <HI>Scilly;</HI> accordingly he imbarqued himself with my Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and some of his principal Servants and other Gentlemen at St. <HI>Michaels-Mount,</HI> and ar∣rived safely at that Island, where he was to attend his Fathers Orders in reference to his own Person, and the concerns of the Kingdoms.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<P>While he was there, he took order for the Govern∣ment of that Isle, and placed therein Sir <HI>John Green∣vill</HI> the Son of Sir <HI>Bevill,</HI> to command in chief in his Majesties name, who upon conditions in 1650. surren∣dred the same to the then called Parliament.</P>
<P>Upon Avisoes from <HI>England,</HI> that there was some Loyal Endeavours on Foot to restore his Father, he Sayled into <HI>France,</HI> and was entertained there by the now French King, but with that coldnesse and re∣misseness of respect that no way suited to his Spirit, or his due greatness.</P>
<P>He had not been long there, but part of the Parlia∣ments Fleet then commanded by Collonel <HI>Ramsbo∣rough,</HI> returned to their Allegiance, and revolted from the service, whereupon the Prince presently left the French Court, and put himself on board that Fleet in the Admiral called the <HI>Reformation</HI> (which was after∣wards lost about the Island <HI>Majorca,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> be∣ing aboard her, and himself and three others hardly es∣caping) and lay some while in the <HI>Downes,</HI> till it was agreed that he should land some Forces, and attaque <HI>Deal</HI> and <HI>Sandwich</HI> Castles, which accordingly he maste∣red, with as much bravery and Gallantry of the Sea∣men, as ever they yet manifested.</P>
<P>But notice of his formidable arrival being brought to <HI>London,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was forthwith ordered to equip all the shipping could presently be made ready to oppose him; at his appearance it was thought fit for the Kings Fleet to sayl for <HI>Holland,</HI> and accordingly they anchored in <HI>Goree,</HI> where the Parliament Ships at∣tended them, and required of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> either to have them delivered, or put to Sea to fight, judging that the Marriners for want of pay had deser∣ted their respective ships; but the <HI>Hogens</HI> durst not then venture upon such an action, while the Kings inte∣rest seemed yet to be promising.</P>
<P>The Prince then went to the <HI>Hague</HI> to his Brother the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> where indeed he was civilly
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>and magnificently treated, with all the demonstrati∣on of kindnesse imaginable, which continued during that Princes life, and his sojournment in that Country. From thence he writ that Letter to his Father which is printed at the end of the Kings book. Hither came un∣to him my Lord <HI>Loughborough,</HI> Collonel <HI>Massey &amp;c.</HI> presently after the Kings death, about which time <HI>Do∣rislaus</HI> was killed there by one Major <HI>Whitford</HI> a Scotch∣man and his associates.</P>
<P>Immediately after came unto him the Commissio∣ners from the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> tendring unto him their Fealty with several propositions, whereupon en∣sued a Treaty which was the next year concluded on at <HI>Breda,</HI> a Town belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the King by the name of <HI>Charls</HI> the second, solemnly owned there by them; during which Treaty, my Lord the Marquesse of <HI>Montrose</HI> was defeated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and barbarously executed, to the dishonour of that Na∣tion, and of <HI>Argyle</HI> especially.</P>
<P>He departed about <HI>June</HI> 1649. out of <HI>Holland</HI> by <HI>Brussels,</HI> where he was nobly entertayned to the French Court again, where he staid not long, being wea∣ry of Cardinal <HI>Mazarines</HI> neglects, but took shipping for the Isle of <HI>Jersey,</HI> where for a while he resided in <HI>Eli∣zabeths</HI> Castle, the Governour whereof was Sir <HI>George Cartret,</HI> where the Commissioners from the King∣dom of <HI>Scotland</HI> made their addresses to him, and desired that he would be pleased to repair to <HI>Breda</HI> in order to perfect the Treaty. By the way, we may not forget that gracious deliverance God gave him in his passage back again from thence, the Vessel where∣in he was, being with a suddain gust of wind almost o∣verset, had not one accidentally standing by the Sails, cut the ropes that held them.</P>
<P>At his arrival in <HI>Holland,</HI> I may not omit one pas∣sage. Before his departure from thence, came unto him an Envoy or Messenger from the French King, his Errand I do not very well remember, but it was some insignificant complement, and pressed hard for Audi∣ence,
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>at last my Lord Chancellor <HI>Hide</HI> procured it, and when he had told his Story, he expected the King would have made him an answer, but the King dismissed him without a word; at his next Audience, he was very urgent for an answer, but no other than before, while the <HI>Monsieur</HI> was overheard to say, that the King he knew well enough could speak French, to which his Majesty was pleased to reply, that once in∣deed he could speak French, but had lately studied to forget it all, intimating the disrespects he had had from that Court. So much by the by.</P>
<P>From <HI>Breda</HI> he went to <HI>Schiveling</HI> near the <HI>Hague,</HI> where he took shipping for <HI>Scotland,</HI> Old <HI>Martin Van Trump</HI> setting him on board, and commending the care and preservation of his person to his Son young <HI>Trump,</HI> who commanded the Fleet that trans∣ported him, which consisted of four Sail of <HI>Dutch∣men</HI> Men of War, the King himself being in a light Sayling Frigot of thirty six Guns. He landed in the North of <HI>Scotland</HI> after a dangerous voyage, be∣ing cast upon the Coast of <HI>Norway,</HI> and mist the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Fleet that lay to attend his landing very narrow∣ly, they having Sayled from thence but five hours before.</P>
<P>Presently after his arrival in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he was Crowned on the first of <HI>January</HI> 1650. at <HI>Scoon,</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert Douglasse</HI> preaching his Coronation Sermon, his Affairs there are so well known to every body, that it is needlesse to recite them here.</P>
<P>Neither is it more to our purpose to mention his expedition to <HI>Worcester,</HI> his valour and great mind ma∣nifested in the Action at that place, let us rather busie our thoughts with the admirable goodness of God in his wonderful escape from the clutches of the persecu∣ting RUMP, and that Rebel <HI>Oliver.</HI></P>
<P>Which way soever he escaped by the conduct of Mrs. <HI>Lane,</HI> (the general received opinion) he arriv'd about
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>the end of <HI>October,</HI> 1651. at <HI>Diep</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and so on to <HI>Roan;</HI> upon the newes of his arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> all the great ones of that Court (the late Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> himself in person) went out to meet him, and congra∣tulate his safe return. But this fair weather lasted but a while, and the King wisely removed himself from his <HI>French</HI> unhospitable harbour, but before he went, he did as good as establish the Crown of <HI>France</HI> upon his Cousins head, by bringing the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to a neutrality, when the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army had advanced beyond <HI>Paris;</HI> but I think he was never yet thankt for it.</P>
<P>His next stage was the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> to his Sister of <HI>Orange,</HI> for the Prince her husband was deceased, where he resided till the Peace made betwixt those States and <HI>Oliver,</HI> by which he was (as it were) banished their Dominions, as by the like compact with <HI>Mazarine,</HI> he was the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>He retired thence to <HI>Colen</HI> a City of <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to be near at hand his concernments, which were to be taken into consideration at the <HI>Diet</HI> at <HI>Franckfort</HI> upon the election of the new Emperour, whither he went privately, and walkt the streets <HI>incog∣nito,</HI> before the meeting of the States of the Empire, and Forein Embassadours.</P>
<P>He sojourned also a while with the Duke of <HI>New∣burgh,</HI> a Prince to whom the King is highly engaged for his manifold high obligements received from him during his abode there, <HI>Mannings</HI> Treason was disco∣vered, who kept correspondence with <HI>Thurloe, Nolls</HI> Secretary, and betrayed the design of Mr. <HI>Penruddock</HI> in the West.</P>
<P>I may not omit that at <HI>Colen</HI> that Rogue <HI>Hannam</HI> with his complices, robb'd him of all the Plate he had, which the Burgers found out, and returned him again.</P>
<P>From thence he betook himself to the Court at <HI>Brussels,</HI> being thither invited by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>who was then newly entred into a war with <HI>Oliver,</HI> and had by him a Court assigned for him at <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> with a Princely maintenance to uphold it, where he remained some three yeares, till the late enterview of the Favourites upon the Frontire, where he was in private present, and from thence past on to <HI>Madrid</HI> the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> and was there magnificently treat∣ed by that King.</P>
<P>Thence posted he back again to St. <HI>Jean de Luz,</HI> where that impudent fellow <HI>Lockhart</HI> made oath he saw him at Masse, but had the reward of a <HI>Scot,</HI> not to be believed. In his return from thence through <HI>France,</HI> he was caressed all the way by the great ones of that Kingdome, and adored as a rising sun, and at last safely and happily returned to <HI>Brussels,</HI> where he now re∣maines, waiting the good hour of our returning to our obedience.</P>
<P>Now what obstinate perverse disobedience can ob∣ject any thing against this our rightful Soveraign, whom so great experience, the knowledge of all places, men, and manners, acquired by his own view, have so fitted and accomplished to Reign and Rule well, it having been the only study in his Exile: God hath made him the better, and we the worse by his absence.</P>
