<HEAD>A Letter from PLIMOVTH Touching The good Successe of Generall <HI>Blake,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Ascues</HI> taking of severall Merchants ships and others, from the HOLLANDERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N Wednesday the 8th. of this present <HI>September</HI> 1652. Generall <HI>Blake</HI> with the Parliaments great fleet passed by within sight of this place.</P>
<P>A Message was sent in from him to Sir <HI>George Ayscue,</HI> who with his fleet was then at anchor in this Roade, To desire him to weigh Anchor, and come out speedily to him with his fleet.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P>Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> then presently sent out Orders to all the ships, and they all sailed out, according to the Orders sent in by Gen. <HI>Blake.</HI></P>
<P>After salutation of the Fleets, Sir <HI>Geo. Ays∣eue</HI> went aboard the Admirall to the Gene∣rall, where a Councell of Officers presently met, and resolved to saile Westward to∣wards the Holland Fleet, or where they should discover them to be.</P>
<P>That night in the evening they set all sail Westward, the season being very good, faire weather that day and the next, and the wind good.</P>
<P>But since that, we have had some boy∣sterous winds, which have been very high, but I doe not heare of any great losse, or harme (blessed be God) that we have sustai∣ned by it.</P>
<P>The Lord hath been pleased to give some good successes to our Fleet since they went out from hence.</P>
<P>For Generall <HI>Blake</HI> hath sent out squa∣drons of ships which have taken from the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>Hollanders twenty saile of Ships, whereof one Man of Warre, one Pickeroon, and the rest Merchants ships.</P>
<P>The Merchants Ships are laden with wine, Strong-waters, vinegar, salt, and o∣ther merchandizes to some value.</P>
<P>Seven of these ships are already come in∣to Plimouth, and orders sent for disposall of them, with directions and instructions, the rest being thirteen, when these came a∣way from the Fleet, they were ordering to be disposed of, they are speedily to be sent into some Port.</P>
<P>The Dutch-men in the Man of warre seeme to be but sorry Sea-men, and it was not extraordinary well manned; they speake of great distractions in Holland, and Zeland, but chiefly in Holland, the Zeland Sea-men are very famous.</P>
<P>On Thursday last Generall <HI>Blake</HI> had a discovery of the Holland Fleet, which are thought to be about a hundred saile, and Generall <HI>Blake,</HI> now with Sir <HI>George Ayscue,</HI> both joyned, are neare an hundred saile, I
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>thinke of the-best Ships, and the gallantest Fleet in the world.</P>
<P>The Holland Fleet were then discove∣red to be about some twelve Leagues off from Scilly.</P>
<P>Hereupo, this discovery being made, a Councell of VVarre was called, to consult what to doe.</P>
<P>And it was resolved with a great union and magnanimity, that they should pre∣sently saile towards them, and endea∣vour if possibly to engage them.</P>
<P>And accordingly our whole Fleet sailed towards the Hollanders great Fleet, and are in pursuit of them.</P>
<P>We doe observe, that the Hollanders doe much vapour, and make shewes, and boastings where they come, at a distance from us, and they finde themselves able to deale with some smaller party then them∣selves, but when any considerable Party, any wayes able to deale with them come neare them, then they saile away.</P>
<P>And they are most often seen, and appear
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>in view towards the evening, that so in the night they may slink away out of sight, we cannot tell where.</P>
<P>Were not the Hollanders puft up in pride and hardnesse of heart like <HI>Pharoah</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> they would not goe on in their obstinacy as they doe.</P>
<Q><HI>But though hand joyn in hand the wicked shall not goe unpunished.</HI></Q>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>By other Letters from other Ports it is certifi∣ed, That there came lately ten ships from</HI> Britta∣ny <HI>in</HI> France, 3 <HI>men of War, the Swan and</HI> 2 <HI>more were a guard to the rest, which were Mer∣chants, the lading very rich, of a considerable va∣lue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>One of the Dutch fleets had a dise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very of them, and engaged them, but the English stood out couragiously, and opposed them, and by the blessing of God brake through them, charging the Dutch with a great deale of gallantry, and are all safely arrived in the Downs.</HI></P>
