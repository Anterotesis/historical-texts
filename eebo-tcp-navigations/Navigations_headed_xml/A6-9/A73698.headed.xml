<HEAD>A true report of a voyage made this last Summer, by a fleete of 73. shippes, sent forth at the commande and direction of the states generall of the vnited Prouinces, to the coast of Spaine and the Canarie-isles.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Vesday</HI> the 25. daie of <HI>Maie</HI> the wind being Northe and Northe∣east, we in the fleete of <HI>Roterdam,</HI> being 20. saile of ships, the sunne beeing southewest and by west, came before <HI>Flushing,</HI> and anke∣red neere vnto <HI>Cleiburch;</HI> our ge∣nerall at his comming found the fleetes North-<HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> ready.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday,</HI> the 26. daie wee remained there at anchor.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 27. day of <HI>Maie,</HI> we tooke into our ships (by the Generals commandement) two gen∣tlemen and foure souldiours.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 28. of <HI>May,</HI> 1599. the wind being nor∣therly, we waied our anchors, and sailed from the <HI>Weelings</HI> with 73 ships, hauing faire weather, set∣ting our course west, southwest. Wee had 3. Ad∣mirals in this fleete, whereof the chiefe Admirall was the ship of <HI>William Derickson Cloper,</HI> wherein was imbarked the honourable gentleman <HI>Peter Van Doest</HI> being generall of the fleete. This ship was
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> called the <HI>Orange,</HI> carying in her top a flag of O∣range colour, vnder whose squadron were certaine Zelanders, with some south and north Hollanders; <HI>Ian Geerbrantson</HI> caried the white flag, vnder whom the Zelanders and ships of the <HI>Maze</HI> were appoin∣ted. And <HI>Cornelius Gheleinsō</HI> of <HI>Vlyshing</HI> wore in his maine top the blew flag, vnder whom were appoin∣ted certaine ships of the <HI>Maze</HI> with some north Hol∣landers. Thus were wee deuided into sundry squa∣drons, but to what ende it was so done, it is to me, and many others vnknowne.</P>
<P>Saturday the 29. of <HI>Maie,</HI> hauing sight of <HI>Callis,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> ships lay to the lee ward, &amp; staied for the rereward. The Lord generall shot off a peece, and afterward hung out the princes flag, in signe that the captains shold come aboord him, presently al the captains en∣tred into their boates, &amp; rowed aboord y<SUP>e</SUP> General, at which time were two pinnaces sent out of the fleet, whereof one was the Generals Pinnace, but vnto what place they sailed, wee were altogether igno∣rant. And when the boates rowed from the Gene∣rall, some of them went aboord the victualers, and tooke out of them certaine fire workes. The sunne southwest, the Generall discharged another peece of ordinance, and put out the Princes flag, where∣vpon presently the captaines went aboord him, and when our captaine returned, he had in his hande a letter closed vp, which hee brought from the Gene∣rall, and wee imagined that euery captaine had re∣ceiued the like, and then wee sailed altogether to∣ward the higth of <HI>Blacknesse,</HI> where wee anchored, (which caused vs greatly to wonder, seeing we had so faire a wind,) but we perceiued afterwards, that this was done, to the ende we should there abide the comming of the great new ship of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> for the soldiours which were appointed for her, were all with vs in a ship of our company.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<P>Sunday, the 30. of <HI>Maie,</HI> where lying at anchor al that night, the next morning we set saile altogether hauing the winde at north east, wee set our course west north west, the weather being faire. The same morning our captain read vnto vs those very arti∣cles which before had bin read vnto vs in the prince <HI>Mauritz</HI> his Court, and afterwards we altogether, and with one accord were sworne to the keeping of them: At noone wee were neere vnto <HI>Beuersier,</HI> ha∣uing a fine gale out of the east north east, the eue∣ning was calme, the formost shippes slacked their sailes, attending the comming in of the hindermost.</P>
<P>Wednesday, the ninth of Iune, by the breake of daie we were hard vnder the coast of <HI>Spaine</HI> neere to <HI>Viuero,</HI> the winde being westerly, we sailed north west and by north, and north northwest, the sunne southwest and by west; we were ouer against the cape <HI>Ortegael,</HI> we sailed north west and by north, to fetch the wind: we were in 44. degrees 20. minuts, at twilight, we had the foresaid Cape of vs about 5. miles south west and by west.</P>
<P>Thursday the 10. of <HI>Iune,</HI> the winde being at east south east, wee directed our course towardes the shore, and might certainly discerne that it was the coast of <HI>Ortegall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ortegall.</NOTE> we bore in west southwest directly with the land, and ordered all thinges as if we pre∣sently should haue had battell, and about noone wee had sight of the <HI>Groyne,</HI> namely the tower which standeth neere the <HI>Groine.</HI></P>
<P>Friday, the 11. of <HI>Iune,</HI> at the breake of day the winde being at north east and by east, sixe of our ships sailed forwarde south southwest, meaning to enter the <HI>Groine,</HI> and there to learne how al things stood. The sunne being southeast, Cape <HI>Prior</HI> was east from vs, wee bare south, presently after we spi∣ed two boates comming out of <HI>Veroll</HI> to learn what
<PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y"/> ships we were, the rather because that the day be∣fore they had seene our fleete at sea: we sailed by the wind, and lay in the wind to stay for their comming. The one doubting vs woulde not come neere vs, the other boat also durst not approch neere vs: wee called to one of the Spaniardes, saying wee came from <HI>Hamborch</HI> laden with cordage &amp; other goods, desiring and praying him to let vs haue a Pilot to bring vs into the <HI>Groine,</HI> wherewith the boate came aboord vs, so that by our great haste and poli∣cie we got one Spaniard, the other which remai∣ned in the boate would not come into our ship, but presently thrust off their boate, making all possible speede to get from vs. Hauing nowe gotten this Spaniarde, hee was presently deliuered into the handes of the Generall, who confessed that there were about 4000. souldiours come into the towne, with certaine horsemen, 36. waggons with money, and 300. pipes of wine, to furnish the Spanish fleet, that he lay the night past in the <HI>Groine,</HI> and was the kings seruant. The sun south south west, we came with our whole fleete before the <HI>Groyne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole fleet commeth before the <HI>Groine.</HI></NOTE> where wee found the great newe ship of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> vnder the Towne.</P>
<P>At 12. 13. and 10. fadome we cast anchor, so that wee might behold much people both on the shoare &amp; vpon the wals of the town. From the castle &amp; town both, they shot mightily with their great ordinance into our fleet, so that there were aboue 200. cannon shot discharged, wherewith some of our ships were hit, but not one man lost, and little hurt done other∣wise. There lay an other castle east ward from the towne, which shot also most terribly, but altogether vncertainly, for we know not that they touched any one ship more then <HI>Moy Lambert,</HI> which was great∣ly to bee wondered at, seeing our fleete lay so thicke
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> together, and so neere vnder the castle. There laie hard vnder the castle 12. great Gallions, with some french ships, which also nowe and then shot among our fleete, but they lay so neere the walles that wee could do them no harme at all. The Lord Generall worthy of al praise, wisely bethinking himselfe, cau∣sed all his captaines and counsell to come aboorde him, that they might together conferre vpon this busines, and what meanes might best bee found, to inuade the towne and the enemy, but they conclu∣ded, not to meddle with the land there: seeing the enemy was there, strong vpon his guard, and that 5. weekes past both from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> &amp; by a French man, they had knowledge of our cōming; by reason of the calme, wee were constrained to towe out our ships with the boates in dispite of al their shot, thus we parted from the <HI>Groyne</HI> without profit, or effec∣ting of any thing, leauing the Papists of <HI>Groyne</HI> as wee founde them. From thence (the winde being at south southwest) wee bent our course towarde Cape <HI>Saint Vincent,</HI> meaning to goe to <HI>Saint Lucars,</HI> hoping to fal vpon them at vnawares, and ere they looked for vs.</P>
<P>Saturday the 12. of <HI>Iune,</HI> hauing got a fine gale we ran along the coast of <HI>Galicia,</HI> at noone wee were before the Iland of <HI>Cesarian,</HI> and set our course to∣wards Cape <HI>Finister.</HI></P>
<P>Sunday the 13. of <HI>Iune,</HI> the lorde Generall gaue sharpe commandement by his letters, forbidding al men aboorde the ships to vse any play, with tables, cards, or dice, either for money, or for pastime, or vpon credit.</P>
<P>Munday the 14. of <HI>Iune,</HI> the wind blew so harde out of the North, that wee could not beare our top∣sailes with our forecourse which sailed south, the sunne was southward, we had Port a Porte of vs,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> be∣ing in 41 degrees and 20. minuts.</P>
<P>Tuesday the 15. of Iune, as soone as day appea∣red, we had sight of Cape <HI>Roxent,</HI> and then we sailed making small way, staying for the comming toge∣ther of the fleete: the wind as before, we sailed south southwest, and were in 36. degrees.</P>
<P>Wednesday the 16. of Iune, towardes the eue∣ning we had sight of two strange ships eastward of our fleete, certain of our ships made towards them and tooke them, the one was an english man of war; the other was a Spanish barke with three missens: at his comming before the Generall, he said, he had already sent 2. prises into Englande, and woulde now with this prise returne home: for his victuals were almost spent.</P>
<P>Thursday the 17. of Iune, it was very still and calme weather.</P>
<P>Friday the 18. of Iune, the wind being at north northeast, we sailed south southwest. The Lord Ge∣nerall caused all the Captaines with the Pilots to come aboord him: demanding of them which of them was best acquainted in the Iles of <HI>Canaria:</HI> and further, by what meanes they might conquer and force the said Ilands, and land their people. And a∣but noone the captaines were chosen and appointed which shoulde commande on lande. The Generall gaue out newe ensignes, to the number of 9. or 10. according to the number of the ships. The lord Ge∣nerall appointed to each new captaine, an Ancient bearer, a Lieutenant, and other officers, with 130. souldiours and mariners, and instructions howe∣uery one of them should gouerne himself on the land.</P>
<P>Saturday the 19. of Iune, the Generall com∣manded that the captaines should deliuer out vic∣tuals but twice a day, to wit, 6. and 6. to a messe: for 6. men, 5. cans of beere of <HI>Roterdams</HI> measure euery
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> day, 5. pounde of breade and no more, a cheese of 6. l. euery weeke, one pound of butter weekely, likewise pease, beanes, or Otemeale twise a day, according to the order. Captaine <HI>Harman,</HI> and captaine <HI>Pijc,</HI> had each of them commission to commande on the land as captaines ouer two companies of saylers, each company containing 130. men. <HI>Harman Thu∣nesson</HI> was appointed Ancient to captaine <HI>Henricke Pijc,</HI> and <HI>de Blomme</HI> Ancient to captaine <HI>Hendricke Hertmā.</HI> The ancients were deliuered the same day.</P>
<P>The 20. 21. 22. daies, wee sailed south southwest, the wind being northerly.</P>
<P>Wednesday the 23. of Iune, the wind was north northeast. The Generall commaunded all the cap∣taines both for the sea and land to come aboord him, where it was ordained and determined how the bat∣tell should be ordered, after they were landed. Ac∣cording to the altitude, we found our selues to be 36 miles from great <HI>Canaria.</HI></P>
<P>Thursday the 24. of Iune, we ranne our foresaid course. The sun being west northwest, we sawe the land east and by south off vs: wee sailed east and by south, and with great labour and diligence bore all that might with the land.</P>
<P>Friday the 25. of Iune, we continued our course to the land for our assured knowledge thereof, and perceiued it to be <HI>Lancerot;</HI> we saw also a small land (which lay between both) called <HI>Allegrania,</HI> and also y<SUP>e</SUP> Iland <HI>Forteuētura,</HI> which is 24. miles great, after∣ward we sailed southwest along the coast of <HI>Forte∣uentura,</HI> which is a lande that hath very high hils. The sun southwest, we were past the Iland <HI>Forteuē¦tura,</HI> and were sailed out of sight thereof, running as yet southwest: about ii. a clocke in the afternoone wee had sight of the Iland of great <HI>Canaria,</HI> for a while wee kept our way; but when the Generall
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> was assured that it was the grand <HI>Canaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole Netherlandish fleet commeth before the I∣sland &amp; town of Grand Ca∣naria.</NOTE> wee all tooke in our sailes, and lay to the lee ward, and so re∣mained vntill it was past midnight, then wee set faile againe and made to the lande, our course west∣warde.</P>
<P>Saturday the 26. of Iune, in the morning the whole fleet sailed west directly to the land, the winde north and by east, and made all thinges ready to land; being now neere the shore, the whole fleete let fall their anchors harde by the great castle, which lieth north northwest from the town, from whence they began to shoot mightily against the ships. The lord Generall and the vize Admirall with the other ships that had the greatest ordenance, anchored close vnder the castle, &amp; for a certain time they plied each other with their great shot; y<SUP>e</SUP> Generals main mast, and his missen mast were shot thorow, and his vize Admirall, namely the great new ship of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> was shot thorow 6. or 7. times; so that some of the souldiours and maryners also were slaine before they entered their long boates to rowe to the shore: But the ships for their parts, had so well bestowed their shot on the castle, that they of the castle began to faint, wherby they discharged not so thicke and often as before. Our men rowed to the land in the long boates, euery one full of soldiours, &amp; the ships which could not discharge their ordenance against the castle, bent them against the shore, (for the ene∣my had three brasse peeces lying vpon the strand) and many people were there gathered together where our souldiours shoulde land. Nowe as soone as the Generall with the most parte of the long boates were come together, they all at one instant rowed toward the shore, maintaining for a while the fight on both sides with their shot. But the General per∣ceiuing that the enemie woulde not abandon the
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> place, with a valiant courage made to the shore, and altogether leaping into the water vp to the middle, maintained the fight with the enemy. Notwith∣standing the enemy no lesse couragious, would not yet leaue the strond, so that some of our souldiours &amp; mariners lost their liues before the enemy would retire: for the place was discommodious, and hard to lande; but most of the enemy were slaine, to the number of 30. or 36. and the Gouernor his right leg was shot off, sitting on his horse. The lord General <HI>Peter von der Doest</HI> leaping first on land, was thrust in his leg with a pike, and had in his body 4. wounds more, and was in great danger to haue lost his life, but that one of the soldiours slewe the Spaniarde which meant to haue don it; but his wounds were of small moment, and his ancient bearer was slain with a shot, the Lieutenant Generall was shot in his throte, captaine <HI>Kruyc</HI> in the heade, 4. soldiours were slain, &amp; 15. hurt in the generals pinnace before they could come to land: But when our people now with one courage all together rushed vpon the ene∣mie, (leauing their ordenance behinde them,) they forsooke the strond, and ran together into the town, carying with them their Gouernour, whose leg was shot off, &amp; he was a Knight of the order of the crosse, and leauing behind them 36. deade carcases on the strond, were presently by our people ransacked, and our dead people buried. Our men now hauing won the strond, put themselues presently in battell ray; the empty boates returned to the ships, but after our people had taken the strond, the castle did neuer shoot shot. After the boates were returned aboord, presently they rowed againe to the shore full of sol∣diours; our people being all landed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Twenty foure companies strong of the Netherlāders.</NOTE> they which for the first time had cōmandement, set vs in 7. troupes, or battalions, being xxiiii. companies strong, of sol∣diours
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> and Mariners, with twentie foure Aunci∣entes. At which time we marched a little forward twenty one a brest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first castle taken,</NOTE> and standing altogether in bat∣tell; suddainly three mariners came running to the Generall, (which had bin at the castle) telling him that the Spaniards desired to deliuer him the castle, so their liues &amp; goods might be saued: the ge∣nerall with some of the captaines and souldiours went first thither, and presently the castle was deli∣uered into his possession, hoping on his pitty and mercy, and leauing behind them all the great orde∣nance, namely 9. peeces of brasse, &amp; 6. Iron peeces, &amp; also al their weapōs. In the castle were about 80. Spaniards, some cannoniers, some soldiors, and some people of the countrey, for the defence thereof; beside powder, shot and match accordingly, for the artillery, and also thirty small peeces or caliuers. Also wee founde 58. prisoners, the rest were slaine with shot in the fury, and some were runaway. The prisoners (which our people had taken in the road with two Barkes, and a ship sunke with our orde∣nance, as they lay all 3. hard before the castle) were sent altogether aboorde the ships: except 3. of the principals which the lord General reserued by him, to the end he might the better knowe the state of all things. Presently 80. soldiours were sent into the castle, who tooke down the kings flag, and set vp the princes colours. At the same instant two Negros were brought to y<SUP>e</SUP> General, which were fetched out of the mountains, they said that they had lien there a sleepe, and knew nothing of any matter. But now when it began to wax dark, we marched altogether a great way towards the town, 4. companies of sol∣diors approched hard vnder the towne, and other 4. cōpanies had the rereward: those of the <HI>Maze,</HI> with the <HI>Amsterdammers</HI> remained a pretty way from the
<PB N="11" REF="7" MS="y"/> towne, vnder the hils; and the Zelanders, with the north Hollanders lay neere the waters side, so wee remained al that night in order of battell.</P>
<P>Sunday the 27. of Iune, after we had now stood al night in battel order, early in the morning we mar¦ched w<SUP>t</SUP> al our 7. troupes hard vnder the town of <HI>Ca¦narie,</HI> where we remained a while in that order: but because they of the castle (which lieth to the towne) shot so mightily among vs; 2. of the troupes retired vnder a hill, where we were a little freede from the castle: for while our people stood imbattailed before the town, the castle did vs great hurt, for somtimes they shot fiue or sixe men with one shot, ere we could entrench our selues before the castle: but after they perceiued that our people had made a small trench against the shot of the castle, they placed on the hill fiue or sixe small peeces, of brasse called falconets (which shoote about a pounde of pouder) and some∣times they shot boules of wood, wherewith in the beginning they slew manie of our people: so aduan∣tagiouslie had they placed their ordenaunce to shoot among vs. Ten or twelue of our Souldi∣ours ranne vp the hill, whereof the enemy tooke one, and presently cut him in foure peeces. Our people seeing that they so tyranouslie dealte with them, about the euening tooke a Spaniarde priso∣ner, and vsed him after the same maner. The lorde Generall perceiuing that many men were flaine with the ordenance, caused fiue peeces of brasse to bee brought from the castle which we had taken the daie before, and toward the euening we beganne to make a battery, and the same euening brought into it three peeces, whereof two were placed presentlie to play vppon the Castle, and the hill: but that e∣uening were but fiue or sixe shotte made. While that our men made the batterie, and planted or
<PB N="12" REF="8" MS="y"/> placed the ordenaunce, the enemy placed his orde∣nance in counter-battery: and before our battery could be finished, and the ordenance placed, many of our men were shot, among whō <HI>Peter vanden Eynde</HI> commissioner, had his leg shot off, whereof he died within three daies after. After that it was dark, al they which lay there before the towne were againe set in order of battel, 15. on a ranke, and so remai∣ned all that night.</P>
<P>The 28. of Iune, early in the morning euery man retired to his quarter, and then were two peeces more brought to the battery, which also were pre∣sently placed on the Rampire, and so wee began to shoot against the castle with 4. peeces, and with the fifth we plaied vpon the small ordenance which lay vpon the hils. The enemy in the castle laid manie sackes of wooll, and placed many tonnes or barrels filled with stones vpon the castle walles, supposing thereby to make some little defence from our orde∣nance; but when an Iron bullet chanced to hit the barrels so filled with stones, it did them mightie hurt, for the stones would scatter maruailouslie a∣broad, whereby many of them that were in the ca∣stle were slaine. Our men hauing now with their shot almost abated the force of the castle, 4. compa∣nies marched vp the hils, intending to beate the e∣nemy from thence, which lay there with the orde∣nance. But the enemy perceiuing himselfe to bee assaulted on all partes, (for most of the ordenance of the castle were dismounted and made vnprofitable, the gate of the towne set one fire by the Generals commandement) about noone they forsooke both the castle, hill, and town, and with all their wiues, chil∣dren, money and Iewels, and all other things that they coulde carry with them, fled into the moun∣taines. Which when our men perceiued, they put
<PB N="13" REF="8" MS="y"/> themselues in order of battell, xv. in a ranke. The lord Generall seeing the Spaniards shamefullie to flie, caused 2. ladders belonging to the enemies, to be brought out of a church which stood without the towne, whereof the one was too shorte, notwith∣standing himselfe with one of the ladders climed vp the walles, one man at once followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The second castle &amp; town of Grand Ca∣naria taken.</NOTE> and by this meanes entered the towne ouer the wals. About noone some of our men ran into the castle without a∣ny reencoūter: the enemy had vndermined the gate, but as we approched the wall, it tooke fire, but not one of our people was therewith hurt. they had also skattered powder in sundrie places, but our men themselues did fire the same: and as soone as our people were entred the castle, the Kinges colours were taken downe, and the prince of <HI>Orenges</HI> set vp, and we found fiue peeces of brasse therein. When wee were all entered into the towne, we put our selues againe into order of battell 15. in a ranke in a low ground within the towne: and the souldiours which entered the towne by the hils side, brought to the Generall a man of <HI>Flushing,</HI> which they had taken out of prison: as soone as the Generall sawe him, he went presently with him to the prison, ac∣companied with some of our captaines, where they found 36. prisoners, which presently were dischar∣ged. And further they declared, that the spaniards had taken with them 2. prisoners into the moun∣taines, which were condemned to be burnt, the one was an english man, the other a dutchman, which had lien in the holy house. Thus with the helpe of God about noone, wee won the great Iland of <HI>Ca∣naria,</HI> and the town of <HI>Allegona,</HI> battered with their owne artillery, and skaled with their owne ladders. Towards the euening wee were quartered in the housen, those wherein the Generall was, were by
<PB N="14" REF="9" MS="y"/> writing freed, that no man might take out any goods, in the rest euery one might go, and take what pillage he could find: but the Spaniards had caried all the best things with them into the mountaines, and in the euening all our people entered the town. Euery captaine with his company were seuerallie lodged, but yet we appointed watch on the hils, as well as in the towne, for the enemy shewed himselfe often vpon the hils, whereby we were forced to keep very good watch.</P>
<P>The 29. of Iune, this morning some of the mari∣ners climed vp the hils, but the enemy (to whom the passage were better known, then to our people) sud∣dainly set vpon them, &amp; killed 20. of them. Towards the euening some 300. of our Soldiours marched towardes a small castle which lay halfe an houres iourney from the towne: but the enemy seeing our people to approch, forsooke the place and fled into the mountaines, our men being ascended, they founde in the castle three brasse peeces; and after they had appointed a Corporall with certaine soldiours to keepe the watch, the rest returned to the citty. The same night the Spaniards tooke one of our soldiors appointed for a forlorne Sentinel, whom they pre∣sently put to the sword.</P>
<P>The last of Iune, as soone as day appeared, wee began to carry the pillage aboorde belonging to the General, and captaines, as wines and other goods. About noone 3. cheefe men of the Spaniards came to our people, which kept watch on the hils with a flag of truce in their handes, which were straight brought before the Generall, and within a while af∣ter, there were 2. more brought vnto him: but after they had bin a while with him they departed again towards the mountaines: and in the euening came other 7. Spaniardes to our watch with a flag of
<PB N="17" REF="9"/> truce, desired to speake with the Generall: but they were sente backe againe into the Moun∣taynes.</P>
<P>The first day of Iuly, 1599. in the morning (our people being on the hils) 2. Friers with three other Spaniards came vnto vs, desiring to be brought to the Generall, which our men accomplished: but the General denied to talke with them, wherefore they were presently sent backe againe from whence they came, for we were then labouring to send the goods a shipboord. Also at that instant was a sermon in the great church of great <HI>Canaria,</HI> made by the prea∣cher of <HI>Ysilmond</HI> with great deuotion, and giuing thanks vnto God for our great victory, desiring him that it would please him daily to increase the same, to the honour of his name: at which Sermon the Lorde Generall was present with foure hundred persons.</P>
<P>The second of Iuly, 1599. wee were forbidden by sounde of the drum, that no man should go beyond the forlorne sentenell placed on the Mountaines: and to sende backe againe into the hilles all such Spaniardes which came with a flag of truce, to speake with the Generall, and to put all such to the sworde as came with weapons. One of our Pin∣naces tooke a Fisherman fishing vnder the Ilande <HI>Forteauentura,</HI> wherin were 7. Spaniardes, which were brought before the General, and prently com∣mitted to prison.</P>
<P>The 3. of Iuly in the morning we began to sende aboord our ships all the bels, ordenance &amp; munition which the enemies had left behinde them, at which time 2000. soldiors were appointed to march to the hils, to seeke the enemy, which lay hid there with their wiues, children &amp; goods, as they were fled out of the towne: and assoone as they approched each
<PB N="16" REF="10"/> other, they began the fight on both sides with great courage, but the enemy was forced to flie, beeing better acquainted with the passages of the moun∣tains then our people were. our men returned with the losse of some 70. persons: among whom captain <HI>Iacques Dierickson</HI> with his boatson were slaine: the rest came into the towne againe into their appoin∣ted quarters.</P>
<P>The 4. of Iuly, in the morning we began to burn the towne, and with pouder blewe vp the castle which lay by the towne, and we burned likewise all the cloisters and churches which were without the towne, lying neere the water side. The town bur∣ning, our people were set in battell, and in that or∣der marched out of the towne, vntill they came to <HI>Gratiosa,</HI> the castle, which we first tooke, lying about halfe an houres iourney from the towne, where the long boates receiued our men, and caried them a∣gaine aboorde. Presently after wee were departed out of the towne, the enemy entered, endeuoring by all meanes possible to quench the fire. And while we were shipping our people, the enemy shewed him selfe some times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or 6. in a company, but they durst not approch vs. The rereward of our men be∣ing shipped, we put fire to the castle which we tooke first, and blew it vp: This done, captaine <HI>Quit</HI> im∣barked himselfe also with his soldiours, and pillage which he had taken in the rode, for his ship wherein he was before was ready to sinke.</P>
<P>The 5. of Iuly, lying in the roade, in the mor∣ning the Generall discharged two peeces of orde∣nance, and afterward put out 2. flags of the princes colours, thereby giuing to vnderstand, that all land captaines, and sea captaines also with one of their Pilots should resort to him, whereupon presentlie they all rowed aboorde the Generall; the Pilots
<PB N="17" REF="10"/> which were best acquainted with the coast, were demanded by the Generall which were the weakest Ilands, and where they might most commodiouslie land: Towards the euening captaine <HI>Quvt</HI> his ship was fired, and suffered to driue towarde the strond. At which time a newe captaine was appointed to captaine <HI>Iaques Dirriksons</HI> ship aforesaide, who was slaine in the mountaines, namely captaine <HI>Kloyers</HI> Lieutenant. And the Generals Clarke of the band was appointed Lieuetenant to captain <HI>Kloyer.</HI></P>
<P>The 6. of Iuly, by reason of the contrary winds, and other inconueniences which happened at this present, and also because such ships, which before were sent to sea, and could not returne by reason of the contrary windes; we remained in the road, vn∣der the castle of <HI>Graciosa.</HI> About noone 4. Spani∣ards came out of the towne with a flag of truce to the strond, directly ouer against our ships, whereof 2. were brought aboorde the Generall in one of our long boates, (the other two with their flag of truce were left behinde on the stronde) which remained with the Generall vntil the euening, and then were set on shore, and so the 4. Spaniardes returned to the towne.</P>
<P>The 7. day riding in the roade, in the morning 4. Spaniards with a flag of peace, came to the shore from the towne, directly ouer against our ships: the fleet seeing them, sent a long boate to the shore, and brought the said 4. Spaniards aboord the General, these men brought with them the ransome of cer∣taine Spaniards, which had deliuered vp the castle of <HI>Graciosa</HI> at the Generals pleasure, which were set to ransome, euery one according to his habilitie &amp; office: and thus all the Spaniardes which were ransomed, together with the 4. spaniardes which brought the ransoms, were set on shore with a long
<PB N="16" REF="11" MS="y"/> boate, and departed to the towne.</P>
<P>The 8. day of Iuly, two howers after sun rising, the Generall with all the ships set saile, carying with him all the Spaniardes that were not ranso∣med, sailing alōg the coast of great <HI>Canaria;</HI> in which time <HI>Ian Cornelesson Zwartekeys</HI> departed this worlde, whose leg was shot off at the taking of the Iland of great <HI>Canaria.</HI> Hauing nowe sailed from y<SUP>e</SUP> hight of the said Iland, which lay southerly from vs, we had sight of captaine <HI>Hertmans</HI> ship, and of 3. others which rode there at anchor: who, so soone as they perceiued our fleete, waied their anchors, and sailed along the coast with vs, which were the ships that the Generall had sent to sea. Sailing thus together vntill the sun was in the west, the wind began to rise more and more, so that we coulde not keep our direct course, but were forced to put to the southwest of the great Iland of <HI>Canaria,</HI> where we anchored: wee had sight of the Iland <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> and of an other of the Ilands of <HI>Canaria,</HI> wherein is the hie mountaine called the <HI>Pyck.</HI> This hil was from vs 14. miles, but by the great hight thereof it seemed to bee within foure or fiue miles off vs, but in the daie time when the sun shined wee could not see it.</P>
<P>The 9. of Iuly, lying thus at anchor, in the mor∣ning most of the long boates went a shore to fetch fresh water, such as they could there find, and caried with them the deade corps of <HI>Ian Cornelesson</HI> afore∣said, the Constables son of the Admiralty of <HI>Roterdā,</HI> called <HI>Zwertkeys,</HI> which was there honorably bu∣ried on the high and drie land. This done, we set on fire the woode which lay on the shore piled and hea∣ped in the woods, but in this place we found not a∣ny Spaniards.</P>
<P>The tenth of Iuly, the boates being all returned
<PB N="21" REF="11"/> to their ships with their people, euery one wayed their anchors and hoised their sailes, the winde at northwest; but being vnder saile together, the wind slacked, &amp; by reason of the great, calme the ships lay a drift for want of wind.</P>
<P>The 11. of Iuly, in the morning it blewe a stout gale in our topsailes out of the northeast, but as we approched the Iland of <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> the winde altered often; sixe or seuen of our shippes, and the rest which were next vnto the shore, had sometimes a gale in their topsailes, and sometimes againe without wind: so that we lay a drift, and could keepe no rec∣koning either of the wind or course, and were forced to alter our course more then 12. times a day.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He 12. day of Iuly sailing thus with great variety of wind, vnder the great Ilād <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> the day appearing, we had the wind more certain, filling our topsailes with a full gale from the northwest: And when it was faire day light, we saw our fleet scattred far one frō another, by meanes of the foresaid mutable windes. Some ships lay driuing by reason of the calme, and other some had a little gale, but the most part of our fleet were west of vs, towards whom with all speed, we with the rest of the ships made. Being al come toge∣ther, wee endeuored to reach the Ilande <HI>Gomera,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="12"/> wherein is a little towne: towardes the euening many of our ships were neere the Iland, but the most part were to y<SUP>e</SUP> lee ward; so that before it grew toward the euening none of vs could come neere the towne. Notwithstanding in the twilight and shut∣ting vp of the euening: <HI>Ian Garbrantson</HI> Admirall of the white flag, his vize Admirall, and a Pinnace following, were come neere the town. Thus the Ad∣miral sayling so neere to the Iland, they of <HI>Gomera</HI> discharged 2. pieces at him, but touched him not. the saide Admirall seeing this, passed on a little farther with the other ships which were neere him, &amp; then tooke in their sailes, and cast their anchors. The other ships which were behinde, laboured all they might to come also vnder the Iland to them.</P>
<P>The 13. of Iuly, the Admiral of the white flag ly∣ing thus at anchor neere to <HI>Gomera,</HI> the greatest part of the fleete were yet in the morning betweene the Iland of <HI>Teneriffa</HI> and <HI>Gomera,</HI> so that parte of the ships were beyonde the towne, and must some∣times cast about to conducte the others in, which were in the lee of vs. When wee had nowe for the most part passed the hight of the Iland, the Gene∣rall gaue a signe to all captaines to come aboorde him, being vnder saile, directing his course to the I∣land of <HI>Gomera,</HI> and the other ships did their inde∣uour to follow him, and anchored about the necke of the vality, lying north north east off the towne. The ships being all come to anchor, the captaines ente∣red presently into the long boates, and rowed a∣boorde the Generall to know his minde: And after they had beene a while in the Generals ship, they returned to their ships, and 4. companies of souldi∣ours were chosen out, and landed in the valley. Which done, al the ships waied their anchors, and sailed directly toward the towne, and then came to
<PB N="21" REF="12"/> anchor againe. After that all our ships lay thus to∣gether in the road neere the valley, before the town: we discharged certaine peeces against the town, but they made no shewe at all of resistaunce; for they had buried foure brasse peeces as soone as they had sight of vs, which lay on the strond neere vnto a small castle; the other sixe companies were also set on land in the long boates, without any resistance: for the Spaniards with their wiues, children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The towne of Gomera aban∣doned by the Spaniards.</NOTE> and all their goods which they coulde carry with them were fled into the mountains. The first 4. cōpanies that were landed, as they marched along the hils side towards the towne, perceiuing that the enemy fled with all his goods towards the hils, sent out a certaine number of soldiours to intercept them, and to take from them the goods which they caried a∣way. And to accomplish this enterprise, our souldi∣ours descended the hill into the valley, meaning sud∣dainly to set vpon the Spaniardes; but the enemie perceiuing their intent, hid themselues in caues which were neere vnto them, vntill our souldiours were in the valley. The spaniardes perceiuing that they were strong enough to encounter with our people, suddainly leapt out of their dens, and beset our souldiours on both sides. Our people seeing themselues thus compassed with their enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eighty Nether∣landers and diuers Spani∣ards slaine.</NOTE> be∣haued themselues most valiantly, so that many of the spaniards lost their liues, and 80 of ours were slaine in this valley: among whom were 2. Lieute∣nants (the one was <HI>Meerbecks</HI> sonne, and the other was Lieutenant to captaine <HI>Bynon</HI>) which had re∣ceiued aboue 50 wounds in their bodies, so pittiful∣lie were they massacred, thus were these worthie champions intercepted. The rest of those 4. com∣panies, which were not present at this fury of the spaniardes, towardes the euening, descended the
<PB N="20" REF="13" MS="y"/> hils and marched into the towne. Presently after this, watch was appointed in al places of y<SUP>e</SUP> towne, and some of the soldiours began to dig the ground, to seeke for such goods as the Spaniardes had buri∣ed, but at that instant they founde nothing, except only certain pipes of wine.</P>
<P>About the sunne setting was brought in a spanish prisoner, which was deliuered to the Prouest mar∣shal, by the Generals commandement, to the end he might bring them to all such places in the Ilande, whereas the Spaniardes had hidden their goods. But because nothing could then be effected by rea∣son that the euening approched, and it began to bee too dark, the Spaniard was committed to a keeper vntill the next morning for the purpose aforesaide. But the night being far spent, &amp; the keeper taking small regard to his charge, the Spaniard secretlie stole away and ran to the mouniaines.</P>
<P>The 14. of Iuly, in the morning the long boates rowed againe to the shore, and caried aboorde such goods as the enemy had left behind them, which for the most part were wines, for they had caried clean away all other things into the mountains, and had left almost nothing in the towne, but only the wines which they had buried in the earth: In the after∣noone our people found 3. bels, which they had buri∣ed in the fields, where corne had growne.</P>
<P>The 15. of Iuly, in the morning our people running vp to the hils 10. or 12. in a cōpany to hunt &amp; seeke for pillage, were suddainly inuironed by the enemy, and 6. or 8. of them slaine; the rest saued themselues by flight. About noone there was a generall muster taken of all the soldiours, to see how many wee had lost: and such ships as were appointed to returne home, began to deliuer out the victuals. The same day were two copper peeces founde: whereof the
<PB N="23" REF="13"/> one was 16. foot and halfe long, and the other about 14. foot.</P>
<P>The 16. day in the morning the Lord Generall gaue notice to all captaines to resort to him aboord his ship, because some of the captaines had not sent victuals vnto the soldiors that were on land, where∣by they suffered hunger, and sundry of the soldiours had complained to the General thereof: At after∣noone, the enemy came to the hill which lieth ouer the towne, crying and calling vnto our men to come and fetch againe their muskets, and towards the euening many marriners with their weapons lan∣ded, and at that instant also all things were ordered to march very early the next morning vp the hils to fetch againe our muskets, caliuers, and other wea∣pons, which the Spaniards before had in mockery, and gibing wise willed vs to fetch from them. But now when all things were ordered for this seruice: the same night arose a strong gale of winde, encrea∣sing more and more, that in the ende it grewe to a mightie tempest, that notwithstanding our fleet did ride vnder the Iland <HI>Gomera</HI> in the road before the towne, some were forced to way their anchors and to put to sea, to preuent the mischiefe like to happen to the ships, by reason they lay so neere one another. And when those ships were a little way in the Sea, they cast their anchors, and there remained. By this occasion the generals aforesaid enterprise was kept backe: we iudging it as a warning, that the Generall should spare and preserue his people from the bloud-thirsty spaniards, which had their holes and dens in the hils, and perhaps might haue taken away many of our liues. And heere by the way; by the name of the Iland <HI>Canaria,</HI> the Spaniards may rightly bee called <HI>Canarians</HI> or <HI>Canes,</HI> for <HI>Canaria</HI> is by interpretation, dogs kinde, for they ran as
<PB N="24" REF="14"/> swift as dogs, and were as tyrannicall and bloud-thirsty as the rauening Wolfe, or any other wild beast, which they sufficiently manifested, for as soon as they could lay handes on any of our people (like vnto mad curs, agreeing with their name <HI>Canariās</HI>) they would presently woary them.</P>
<P>The 17. this hurtfull night ended, and the tem∣pest ouer passed, and alaid, the couragious soldiors were all in readines, desirous to execute this peece of seruice, exspecting &amp; desiring nothing more, then to march vp the hils, and to incounter their ido∣latrous enemies. But vpon good consideration, this enterprise was staied, and some 300. soldiours sent into the same valley, where 3. daies before our people had beene suddainly compassed, intrapped, and slaine by the Spaniards. Our soldiours being come to the valley aforesaid found no resistance, nei∣ther could once see a spaniard; but found a smal peece of brasse about a fadome long, and two barrels of gunpowder; and when our souldiours perceiued that there was no good to bee done (forbearing to mount the hils, because they had no commission so to do) with such thinges as they had they returned into the towne. The euening now approching, the Generall commanded to carry aboord the ships, such goods as they had there found, and digged out of the ground, which was accordingly done and accompli∣shed, among which things were three brasse peeces, some bels and other goods.</P>
<P>Sunday the 18. of Iuly, we remained at anchor in the road of the Iland <HI>Gomera.</HI></P>
<P>Munday the 19. of Iuly, remaining yet in the I∣land <HI>Gomera,</HI> and seeing that the Spaniardes con∣tinued in their secret holes, and dens of the moun∣taines, wee set fire on the towne, and as neere as we could burnt down all places, as Cloisters chur∣ches,
<PB N="25" REF="14"/> hermitages and houses, remaining yet in the towne vntill it was noone. After that all this was accomplished; we the vnited soldiours forsooke the towne, and presently the Lord General, with al his company, went aboord the ships. Thus we left the Iland <HI>Gomera</HI> burning, which was neuer before done by any nation. The Spaniardes seeing that the soldiours were departed out of the Iland, with all speed possible, in great heapes came running out of their secret caues and holes, to quench the fire, like as they of <HI>Allegona</HI> in the Iland of great <HI>Cana∣ria</HI> before had done.</P>
<P>Wednesday the 20. of Iuly, we lay stil in the road before <HI>Gomera,</HI> in this time 2. of our soldiours were put into captain <HI>Cloiers</HI> ship, and in lew of them, we receiued out of his ship 2. others, which were hurt, with two Spaniards.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter that the Iland of great <HI>Canaria</HI> was by the vnited soldiours taken, and won by force of Armes, and the Iland <HI>Gomera</HI> conquered, for sundry reasons they were forsakē, after they had caried to their ships such things as they found, fired the townes, churches, cloisters, and houses, and ra∣sed their Castles. The Lord Generall commanded
<PB N="26" REF="15"/> all Captaines and officers of the fleete to resorte vnto him aboord his ship. The same principals being come accordingly, he welcommed them and shewed them al friendship he could, thanking them for their good and faithfull endeuours which they had shew∣ed in this seruice, which he performed with a singu∣lar oration, praying Almighty God that he woulde vouchsafe to be his only loadsman, &amp; merciful defen∣der, in all his enterprises, to the honor of his name, and happy successe of the vnited Netherlandish pro∣uinces.

<P>Wednesday the 21. of Iuly, the wind was nor∣therly: The lord Generall commanded all the cap∣taines and officers to resort vnto him: and in most curteous maner againe the second time, tooke his leaue of them all, ordaining and appointing in his place as Admirall Generall ouer all those shippes which were to returne home, the valiant captaine <HI>Ian Gerbrantson,</HI> desiring and straightly charging them al there present, to shew all obedience and du∣ty vnto him, as to his owne person, and that they should make his minde knowne to all others which had not beene there present.

<P>Wednesday the 18 of August, sixteene ships of our fleet which were sent to returne home, being in company together in the latitude of 36. degrees and 10. minutes, the wind southwest sailing north∣east, before it was noone, we perceiued 2 strange ships vnder saile comming out of the northwest, to∣wards whom we made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Spanish prizes taken.</NOTE> and at afternoone we ouer∣tooke them, and made them our prises: they were both Spaniardes, the one was a small Barke, and came from Cape <HI>de Blanco</HI> in 21. degrees, loaden for <HI>Woluis</HI> in the <HI>Condate</HI> where they dwelled. In the same ships was a marchant of <HI>Cyuill</HI> with 47. men, each of their ships hauing two cast peeces and euery man his musket, but they made no shewe of defence, or offending.
