<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce the taking of <HI>Beaumont,</HI> by a Detachment of our Army, the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> has employed all his skill to Repossess himself of that place, by reason of its Advantagious Situation, but hitherto he has been frustrated in all his Designs. Be∣tween the 9th and 10th he broke up, with his Camp, in hopes to surprize the <HI>Count van der Lippe,</HI> who had put a strong Garrison into that place: But his Majesty having timely Notice of his Design; gave immediately Orders to our Army to March, which we did ac∣cordingly the 10th in the Afternoon, and about 5 a Clock at Night, we came within Sight of the Enemy, we Marched directly towards him; And about Night our whole Army was ranged in order of Bat∣tel, within a Cannon Shot of the <HI>French.</HI> They had posted themselves upon the Hills of <HI>Faubrechies,</HI> and we had <HI>Beaumont</HI> in the midst of our Line. The whole Night was spent in laying Bridges over a Water and Morass that was between us and the Enemy, some of our Cannons were Planted, and we intended to pass the Bridges by break of Day, and to Attack the Enemy, but his Majesty being advanced within a Musquet Shot of the Enemy, and taken a full view of the Ground, it was found that there was not Room enough to Range four Regiments in order of Battle; There being nothing but Defilees on all sides, and that Consequently it was impossible to Attack the Enemy, without hazarding our whole Camp. We remain'd nevertheless in order of Battle, to try if the Enemy would give himself the Trouble to come half way; But they keeping themselves very close according to their usual manner, we returned in the sight of the Enemy. It was expect∣ed they would fall into our Reer: Having so fair an opportunity for it; But not a Man of theirs stirr'd, and we arrived safely into our old Camp at Court. Since this time orders have been sent to the Bailiffs and Majors to have eigtheen thousand Pioneers ready to March, with∣in three days time, and this is without doubt to execute some consi∣derable Enterprise. We have indeed not been able as yet to provoke
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>our Enemy to a Pitch-Battel, nor have we taken any great Fortresses; But if understanding Men will soberly consider that his Majesty has forc'd the <HI>French,</HI> to entertain for so Considerable a time, Two vast Armys within their own Territories, that so considerable a part of the <HI>French</HI> Kings Dominions, that enabled his Forces to make such great Excursions into the remaining <HI>Spanish</HI> Provinces, are now destroyed and laid wast, And that in the mean time, there is time given to the Subjects of his Catholick Majesty quietly to bring in their Harvest, and consequently to fill the Magazins with Provisions for the next Campaign, I say they that consider all this, will certainly agree that the King has done very much, and more than reasonably could be expected, altho' it should not come to any considerable Action this year, which as yet we have great reason to hope, for the last News we had out of <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Piedmont</HI> entertain us in our hopes of great Success on that side.</P>
<P><HI>Montmelian</HI> makes a vigorous defence, though it has been formally Besieged, and the Trenches opened eight days ago. <HI>Catinat</HI> with the main Body retreats towards <HI>Pignerol,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> is al∣ways at his heels. Upon their Retreat to <HI>Piobes,</HI> Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> fell in∣to his Rear with 500 Horse, and cut entirely off three Squadrons of Horse, and a Troop of Carbines of the Enemy, but the Enemy, being reinforced, the Prince did retreat, and had certainly lost his life, in case a <HI>German</HI> had not killed a <HI>French</HI> Dragoon that was just going to shoot the Prince. In the mean time, the <HI>French</HI> carry all their provisions out of that Country into <HI>Dauphine,</HI> which is a certain sign that they have but little hopes to maintain themselves in <HI>Savoy.</HI> The three <HI>German</HI> Generals <HI>Caraffa, Palfi,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> are alrerdy arrived at <HI>Turin,</HI> and his Electoral Highness of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is expected there himself within few days, he having taken the Post at <HI>Munichen, August</HI> the 10th. <HI>New-stile,</HI> Besides the <HI>German</HI> Succors has all past through the Dutchy of <HI>Milain</HI> from whence we have received this following List,
