<HEAD>An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parlia∣ment Assembled, For the better observation of the monethly Fast. 24 Aug. 1642.</HEAD>
<P>VVHereas the Kings most Excellent Maiesty, upon the request of the Lords and Com∣mons in this present Parliament assembled, and by and with their advice and consent, considering the lamen∣table and distressed condition of his good Subiects in the Kingdome of <HI>Ireland;</HI> (that there might be a gene∣rall humiliation of all the estates of this Kingdome be∣fore
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> Almighty God in Fasting and Prayer) was graci∣ously pleased to Command the keeping of a monethly Fast; and to the end that all persons might the better take notice thereof (and to leave such without excuse, as should not duly keep and observe the same) did afterward by his Proclamation of the 8 of <HI>January</HI> 1641. appoint that the same should be generally, publike∣ly, and solmnly holden and kept, as well by absti∣nence from Food, as by publike Prayers, Preach∣ing, and Hearing of the Word of God, and other Religious and holy Duties in all Cathedrals, Col∣legiate, and Parish Churches, and Chappels within the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> &amp; Dominion of <HI>Wales</HI> (with∣out any exception) on the last Wednesday of every Moneth, to continue during the troubles in the said Kingdom of <HI>Ireland:</HI> All which His Maiesty did strait∣ly charge and command should be reverently and de∣voutly performed by all His Subiects, as they desire the blessing of Almighty God, and would avoid his heavy indignation against this Land and People; and upon paine of such punishments as may iustly be insti∣cted upon all such as shall confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e or neglect so Reli∣gious a worke and duty.</P>
<P>And whereas the Lords and Commons in both Hou∣ses of Parliament, have received divers Informati∣ons from severall parts of this Kingdome and Domi∣nion of <HI>Wales,</HI> of the great neglect of the due observa∣tion and keeping of the said Fast upon the dayes ap∣pointed, and of the prophanations of the same by ma∣ny irreligious, ill affected, loose, and scandalous per∣sons, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of the Clergy as others, who are so farre from afflicting their soules, and loosing the bands of
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> wickednesse, as that they provoke the wrath of Almigh∣ty God, and make so pious a meanes to procure his blessings, the occasion of greater Iudgements.</P>
<P>For the prevention whereof for the time to come, the Lords and Commons doe Order, Declare, Ordaine, that in all and every the Cathedrals, Collegiate, and Parish Churches, and Chappels within the Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> and Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> (without any ex∣cepti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n) upon every Lords day, next and immediately before any the daies appointed for the said publike Fast, the Parson, Vicar, Curate, or Minister, that upon that day shall Officiate, or exercise in any of the said Cathedrals, Collegiate, Parish Churches, or Chap∣pels, shall give publike notice in every of the said Ca∣thedrals, Collegiate, Parish Churches, or Chappels respectively, of the Fast day next ensuing immediately after Sermon or Prayer ended in the forenoon before the Congregation be dismissed, earnestly exhorting and perswading all the people to the solemne due keeping and religious observation of the whole day appointed for the said Fast, and that they would repaire to some Church or Chappell, there diligently and reve∣rently to attend all such holy Duties as shall be used in the observance of the same; that they forbeare to use all manner of Sports and Pastimes whatsoever, and their ordinary Trades and Callings upon the said day, as well Carriers, Waggoners, Carters, Waynmen, Drovers, Butchers, Hucksters, Shop-keepers, La∣bourers, or any others using any Art, Trade, Mystery, or Manual Occupation whatsoever, and that all Wintners, Taverners, Alehouse-keepers, and keepers of Victualling-houses, doe forbeare to keep open their Doors, Bulks, or Shops, or to sell or utter (except in

<P>VVHereas the Lords and Commons in Parliament, have made an Ordinance for the more strict and solemne keeping of the dayes of publike Fast, which are not by all persons duly observed, even in these times of publike Calamity, to the great dishonor of God, and the contempt of the Authority of both Houses of Parliament.</P>
<P>Now that more particular notice may be given to all such that shall offend herein, before any exemplary punishment be inflicted upon them, It is Ordered by the Commons now Assembled in Parliament, that all Constables (or their Depu∣ties shall the day before every publike Fast, repaire to every house within their severall and respective Liberties, and charge all persons, that they strictly observe the Fast, accor∣ding to the directions in the said Ordinance.</P>
<P>And they shall upon the said dayes of the publike Fast, walke through their said Liberties, diligently serching for, and taking notice of all persons, who either by following the worke of their calling, or sitting in Tavernes, Victualing, or Alehouses▪ or any other wayes shall not duly observe the same, and they are hereby required, to returne the names of all such persons as they shall finde so offending, as also such Informations as they shall receive against any other persons within their Liberties guilty of the least offence unto the Committee for Examinations that so they may be proceeded against for the contempt of the said Ordinance, and all Constables are to observe these directions, from time to time, so long as the said Publike Fast shall be kept, without expecting any further Order.</P>
