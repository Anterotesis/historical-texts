<HEAD>JOYFULL NEWES From the Princes NAVIE AND A great Victory obtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned at Sea: With the particu∣lars thereof, and the manner of the Fight. Sent in a Letter from the Navy the 4 of <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1648.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Thursday last being the 2. of this instant Novem. we received an Allarum from Sea, occasioned by certaine ships, who had the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>Princes colours, and struck sayl within three leagues of <HI>Helverd-stuce;</HI> whereupon the Lord Amirall sent forth three Frigats, and two of the great Vessels, who chased them, and gave them many a gallant shot, and after few hours dispute, boarded one of them, &amp; sunk another; the Master of the prize which was taken, con∣fessed, that they were bound for the Prince, with a re∣solution to joyn with him, and to assist his Highnesse a∣gainst the Parliament.</P>
<P>This Fleet is said to consist of about eleven ships, most of them being men of Warre, and it is rumour'd, that they were most of them Swedish Ships.</P>
<P>But the Princes Fleet hath declared, that they will not be commanded by any strangers, who since the dis∣missing of the Lord <HI>VVilloughby,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Batten,</HI> have made Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Lord Admirall; but the Sea-men were so much inraged and troubled thereat, that they began to mutiny, resisted the Command of Pr. <HI>Rupert</HI> and the rest of the Irish and Dutch Commanders▪ fell to blowes, killed 3 or 4 eminent Commanders, woun∣ded divers of them, amongst the rest, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> hath received a dangerous wound, and its thought mor∣tall. The Conflict being ended, the Mariners of the re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olted ships called a Councell amongst themselves, turned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Pr. <HI>Rupert,</HI> and divers others, and have made choice of new Commanders.</P>
<P>They have sent a Letter to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> to in∣vite him aboard; but by reason of the weaknesse of his body, occasioned by sudden sicknesse, and a dangerous disease, He cannot answer their expectations.</P>
<P>The Lord Admiral hath again offered them Indem∣nity,
<PB REF="3"/>and it is conceived they will embrace the same, for they have protested to his Lordship, never to in∣gage with the Princes Cavalry; The Lord Admirall hath sent a Declaration to them, advertizing.</P>
<P><HI>That He will use his utmost endeavours towards the setling of truth, and a happy peace in this unsetled Church and Kingdom, and that He will be instrumentall for the bringing of his Majesty to London, and setling of His Maiesty, the Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>the Duke of</HI> York, <HI>and the rest of His Royall Issue in their just Rights and privi∣ledges, s soon as His Majesty shall be pleased to satisfie and confirme the Desires of his two Houses of Parliament so much tending to the good and preservation both of Re∣ligion, Crown and Lingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>Some Overtures have been lately made betweene his Highnesse the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and his Lordship, in relation to a conjunction and uniting of both Navies; but his Lordship hath utterly detested against the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, slighting the Princes invitation and representing a Letter unto his Highnesse, That he takes it as the greatest dishonour that can be incident to man, for any Personage whatsoever to betray the trust reposed in him, and that He is resolved to sacrifice his life in the Cause and Engagement which he hath undertaken, not doubting but that the omnipotent God of Heaven (to whom the Honour of his Engagement doth belong) will cause the Wnids and Seas to fight for them, whose Truth is their Banner, Shield and Bucker; and therefore dehorts his Highnesse to persist no longer in the way he is in, but forthwith to come in, and unite himself with the Parliament, that so his person may be preserved from all violence and injury, and a resto∣ration made of all due Rights and priviledges, and that he may render himself instrumentall for the compo∣sing of all differences, and establlshing of a firme and
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>lasting Peace throughout His Fathers Realmes and Dommions.</P>
<P>This Letter is said to be sent from aboard the St. <HI>George,</HI> to the Prince at <HI>Helver-Sluce,</HI></P>
<P>Letters further from the Navy say, That the Prince is desirous to spin out some longer time at <HI>Goree</HI> be∣fore he puts to Sea, in expectation of what the Treaty wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> produce, and that if it takes not effect, he is resol∣ved for <HI>Ireland,</HI> to joyn with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Inchiqueen,</HI> and to land an Army in the West of <HI>England</HI> at the Spring, for the re-investing of the King, and restoring of Him to his just Rights, Po∣wer and Authority</P>
<P>The said Letters do further intimate, That the Lord high Admirall hath received a Letter from his Maje∣sty, purporting things of great concernment, and how farre he hath condescended to the desires of his two Houses, desiring him to be instrumentall for the set∣ling of a firm and lasting peace.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>From aboard the St. George <HI>4.</HI> Novemb. <HI>1648.</HI> From the Isle of Wight thus.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce my last, Here hath hapned severall Overtures between his Majesty and the Parliaments Commis∣sioners; they have had much debate upon the Propo∣sitions, especially that concerning the Church, which the King stuck much at; but the dark Cloud being ex∣pelled, and the splendor of the Gospell shining most gloriously in the eyes of his Majesty, He was graci∣ously pleased to declare his Royall Assent to all the Propositions, and to grant His Royall Word to passe all things desired by his two Houses, that may be agreeable and consonant to the fundamentall Lawes
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>of this Kingdom. And as to the busines of the Church (which is all they stick at) the King hath promised to give his concurrence therein, rather then his People shall suffer for his dis-assenting. And 14 dayes more being added to the <HI>Treaty,</HI> it is hoped a fair conclusion will attend the happy beginning. His Majesty hath de∣livered another Paper to the Commissioners, which I have here inserted, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SIGNED>CHARLES R.</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>HIs Majesty resteth very much unsatisfied, That you have now again wholly declined the answe∣ring of those three questions so clearly proposed by him, which your selves also confesse to be of grea im∣portance, upon this only pretence, <HI>That the whole volumn of Ecclesiasticall policy is contained in them:</HI> Whereas his Majesty did neither expect nor require from you any large or polemicall Discourse concerning those Questions conceiving that you were in some sort ob∣liged to have declared what your judgment was there∣in, with the grounds thereof. For certainly untill one of these three things can be clearly evidenced unto his Maj. 1. Either that there is no certain form of Church Government at all prescribed in the Word. 2 That the Civill power may change the fame as they see cause. 3 Or if it be unchangable, that it was not Episcopall, but some other, his Maj. thinks himself excusable in the judgment of all reasonable men, if he cannot be indu∣ced to give his consent to the utter abolition of that Government of the Church which he found here set∣led to his hands, which hath continued all over the Christian world, from the times of the Apostles untill this last Age.</P>
</LETTER>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>And for the better faciliating the Work in hand, we hear that his <HI>Majesty</HI> hath sent a Message (by the D. of <HI>Lenox</HI>) to the Aldermen and Common-councell of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and also to divers members of both Houses, intimating, <HI>That He desired a longer time to be added to the Treaty, desiring them to be instrumen∣tall for the re-investing of his Maiesty, and to agitate for his speedy comming to</HI> London, with other remarkable Occurrences, which He desires may be cammunicated to his Royall hearted Citizens, and that they may seri∣ously read and peruse the same. It is conceived his Ma∣jesty hath some notable design against the Army, for He hath vowed to play a new Game, if the Treaty take not effect. But upon the close of this Letter, here arrived a <HI>Post</HI> from the Army to Col. <HI>Hamond,</HI> desiring him to be vigilant for the last 14 dayes added to the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and to prevent his <HI>Maiesties</HI> escape there being a design laid for the conveying of his person away, if he cannot accomplish his desires in the said respit of time. Col. <HI>Hamond</HI> is extraordinary vigilant in mana∣ging the great trust reposed in Him, and hath declared <HI>that he will use his utmost endeavours for the preserva∣tion of His Majesties Royall person from the hands of his Enemies, and to protect him from the rage and subtilty of those who seek his Maiesties ruine</HI> [meaning the Royall party now resident at his Court] <HI>And the Souldiery doe assure him, they will live and die with him therein.</HI></P>
