<HEAD>The State of FRANCE, as it stood in the Ninth yeer of this present Monarch <HI>LEWIS the XIIII,</HI> Written to a Friend.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Ince I had first the honour to bee one of those whose Conversation you have che∣rished with so many signall obligations, and, as it were, currents of civility; I can hard∣ly
<PB REF="3"/>think, that (when by so ma∣ny literal expresses and perso∣nal commands, you enjoin me to deliver something in <HI>writing,</HI> touching the late subject of our discourse) you have either cause to delight in my triviall con∣ceptions, or designe my discre∣dit: For however your instan∣ces have at last prevailed, yet your Honor is no lesse concer∣ned to be tender how you publish my defects, whilest in them onely (though the faults be mine) men will so perem∣ptorily conclude your want of judgment, and condemn your Election. But you have pro∣mised to be discreet, and I shall then make a saving adventure
<PB REF="3"/>of my Reputation with you, who have candor and charity not from the <HI>Multitude,</HI> but the stock of your own <HI>worth</HI> and ingenuous Education; of which this <HI>Essay</HI> will be rather an History, then any thing o∣therwise capable to informe you, who know already so much more, and better, then I can possibly either write or relate.</P>
<P>But to begin once, since it is my fate to obey you; I shall nothing alter the <HI>Scene,</HI> which was then Presented you, when you were pleased (as it since appears) to take notice of those casuall Discourses of mine, wherein I posted over the
<PB REF="4"/>best Remarks, and most mate∣riall Observations which my weak Judgment had been able to recollect, during my so ma∣ny <HI>Pererrations,</HI> and unprofi∣table <HI>Sojourn</HI> abroad, and espe∣cially in this Kingdome of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Nor wil I vex your patience with any <HI>Topographicall</HI> Descri∣ptions, as being the daily sub∣ject of your Contemplations, when at any time you please to refresh your self amongst those exquisite <HI>Cards</HI> of the latest and most accurate <HI>Editi∣ons:</HI> But represent, in as suc∣cinct a Method as I am able, what in order to Affairs (as in the Government of this most
<PB REF="4"/>active and Illustrious Monar∣chie they now stand) I conceive to be chiefly proper and requi∣site for a Gentleman of our Nation (under the notion of a <HI>Traveller</HI>) to be able to render an accompt of at his Return: And therefore, before I proceed further, I will complie with your desire, and speak a word or two (by way of Introducti∣on, or Digression rather) of my <HI>sentiment</HI> and opinion tou∣ching <HI>Forraign Travel</HI> in Gene∣ral, wherein I shall also deal very impartially with all the world concerning mine own particular, as being (I hope) taking my long farewel there∣of.</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>That which first rendred me of this <HI>Apodemick</HI> humour, (I shall not discourse here of <HI>Mercuriall</HI> complexions, whom <HI>Physiognomists</HI> affirm to be <HI>Indi∣vidua vaga's,</HI> like my self) pro∣ceeded from a certain vaine Emulation which I had to see the best of Education, which every body so decrying at Home, made me conceive, was a commodity onely to be brought from a far Countrie; and I cannot say, without a little ambition too of <HI>knowing,</HI> or at least of having the pri∣viledg to <HI>talk</HI> something more then others could reasonably pretend to, that had never bin out of sight of their owne
<PB REF="5"/>chimnies smoke: All which was a Ridiculous affectation, contracted first from the ordi∣nary <HI>Radomontadas</HI> of such as have seen strange places, and great want of discretion, and so fondly transported with the pleasure onely, and temptation of <HI>Novelties,</HI> the very instru∣mental causes of this unsetled extravagancy.</P>
<P>True it is, <HI>Non omnis fert om∣nia Tellus:</HI> for the great and good God hath discreetly, and very wisely disposed, in the furnishing and adorning (as I may say) of this <HI>Terrestrial Ca∣binet,</HI> having left no one part or corner thereof without some thing specially different,
<PB REF="6"/>and admirably remarkable, ei∣ther in the composition, qua∣lity or use; all of them, ac∣cording to their position, situ∣ation, and effects, admirably commodious, and dependant; of which divine <HI>Oeconomy</HI> there may be infinitely more spo∣ken, then will be sutable to this design, after I have infer∣red that for these respects only, a <HI>Traveller</HI> has some excuse, as well as encouragement to go abroad and see the world.</P>
<P>Now then, for as much as the end of all our <HI>Appetites,</HI> wisely <HI>inquired</HI> into, ought to be the principal <HI>Mira,</HI> and terme to all our actions, he that would travell rationally, and
<PB REF="6"/>like a <HI>Philosopher,</HI> must industri∣ously apply himself to the pur∣suit of such things, as (through∣out all his <HI>Peregrinations</HI>) may result most to the profit, and Emolument of his own Coun∣try at his Return; whether in the accomplishing of his per∣son or affairs, there being no∣thing more veritable, then that saying of <HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L>
<L><HI>Turpe quidem mansisse diu, vacuúmque redire.</HI></L></Q> And therefore <HI>Peregrinatio ani∣mi imperio, &amp; corporis ministerio debet perfici:</HI> For so it was that <HI>Ptolomies</HI> young Noblemen, of whose rich fraight and return wee read of; travelled, and brought home with them
<PB REF="7"/>wares of more value, then if they had transported Gold and Pearles. For the same cause PYTHAGORAS took leave of his Friends and native Coun∣try, to which hee afterwards returned with the Learning of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his <HI>seventh Book</HI> and <HI>fourteenth Chapt.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And not as <HI>Plinie</HI> affirmeth, <HI>Exiliis verius quam peregrinatio∣nibus susceptis:</HI> Nay, his pas∣sion and thirst after this excel∣lent Commerce was so admi∣rable, that the same Authour <HI>in Syren.</HI> tells us, he made no∣thing of <HI>Circumcising</HI> himself, that so hee might with the more freedom, and lesse suspi∣cion
<PB REF="7"/>pry into their profound∣est Mysteries: For therefore were the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests cal∣led <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>incommunicable,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>imparticipable. Clem. Alex.</HI></P>
<P>Such a designe led THA∣LES, EUDOXUS, APOL∣LONIUS, nay PLATO him∣self, and divers other renown∣ed Personages, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. To comprehend (saith <HI>Plutarch</HI>) the Mysteries of <HI>Philosophy</HI> and <HI>Divinitie:</HI> As it seems, estee∣ming the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> to be the most Ancient and Noble peo∣ple of the whole World, both for the wisdom of their <HI>Consti∣tutions,</HI> and exceeding Reverence which they bare to <HI>Learning:</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>These being indeed the fruits &amp; most noble acquisitions, which a Gentleman (who is a quali∣fied <HI>Traveller</HI>) should study and endeavour to furnish himselfe with whilst he is abroad.</P>
<P>But these, some may object, are <HI>Heathen</HI> examples, <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> are content to be lesse curious, and stay at home: Saint <HI>Hierom</HI> shall be mine Instance on this occasion: and truely, it is worth the reading what he hath delivered in one of his <HI>Epist. ad Paulinum,</HI> you shall find it praefixed (amongst severall other) to <HI>Sixtus</HI> his Edition of the Bible, when (after those words, <HI>Legimus in veteribus historiis quosdam lustrasse
<PB REF="8"/>provincias, novos adisse Populos, maria transisse: ut eos quos ex libris noverant, coram quoque viderent, &amp;c.</HI>) making a very ample <HI>repetition</HI> of what I have before spoken in the persons of other men, and especially of the incomparable <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and those noble youths who went out of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> only to <HI>hear</HI> the eloquence of <HI>Livie,</HI> when <HI>quos ad contemplati∣onem sui ipsa Roma non traxerat, unius hominis fama perduxit,</HI> re∣ferring us to the eight volums which <HI>Philostratus</HI> hath pur∣posely written on this subject; thus he expostulates, <HI>Quid lo∣quar de saeculi hominibus,</HI> &amp;c. what do I troubling you with old
<PB REF="9"/>stories? when the <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> himselfe, that vessell of E∣lection, and Doctour of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> dispersed the Christian Religion through so great a part of the world; by his al∣most perpetuall <HI>Peregrination,</HI> after his miraculous conversi∣on; the like may be affirmed of the rest of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and even our <HI>Blessed Saviour</HI> him∣self: but I recommend you to the Authour. On the other side, as we have justly censured those who meerly run abroad out of that vanity of spirit, and such trivial considerations as I have already reproached in my self, so are we likewise to dis∣band another sort of <HI>travellers,</HI>
<PB REF="9"/>whose <HI>Cynical</HI> reservednesse, de∣clares to the world that they have only minded the sensua∣lity and satisfaction of a pri∣vate <HI>Gusto:</HI> communicating usually at their return but what may justly merit that re∣priment which <HI>Socrates</HI> once gave to a young man who would render him no accompt <HI>of all</HI> his long absence, <HI>quod se∣cum peregrinatus fuerit:</HI> in the mean time, as much to be ab∣horred is all maner strangness, disdain, Affectation and loqua∣city, by which so many travel∣lers now a days (for the most part) distinguish themselves from the Vulgar, to that over acted degree of mimi∣call
<PB REF="10"/>folly, as one would easi∣ly imagine they had all this while lived in Pension rather amongst Apes, and Parrats, than ever either seen, or con∣versed with persons of Inge∣nuity or Honour.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>To proeeed therfore, presup∣pose Travell <HI>ut suscipiatur propter unum aliquem finem,</HI> as we have already constituted it: we are yet to give our young subject leave to be so far <HI>practical,</HI> as that he do not slip any opportunity by which he may inform him∣self as well in things even <HI>Me∣chanically</HI> curious and usefull, as altogether in the Mysteries of Government and <HI>Polity,</HI>
<PB REF="10"/>which indeed are more <HI>appo∣sitely</HI> termed <HI>Philosophicall.</HI> Those who have imposed on themselves, and others, so ma∣ny different species of <HI>travell,</HI> as it may be said to contein <HI>Theoreticall</HI> parts in it, that is to say, the <HI>Metaphysicall, Physicall,</HI> and <HI>Mathematicall,</HI> are, in my ap∣prehension, more exact and tedious in their <HI>Analysing,</HI> then perhaps they needed to have been; of them therefore I say no more: it shall be sufficient for him whom I send abroad, that he conform himself to such precepts as are onely <HI>necessary,</HI> not cumbersome; which Rule he shall likewise do well to observe even in his
<PB REF="11"/>very necessary <HI>accoutrements</HI> and <HI>port-manteau.</HI></P>
<P>First then, supposing him to be a <HI>Young Gentleman</HI> apt for all <HI>Impressions,</HI> but from his <HI>primary education</HI> inclined to the most worthy: having set his Foot upon the <HI>Continent,</HI> his first study shall be to master the <HI>tongue</HI> of the Country wherein hee resolves to Re∣side; which ought to be un∣derstood perfectly, written congruously, and spoken intel∣ligently: after which he may do well to accomplish him∣self in such <HI>exercises,</HI> as are most commendable at home, and best attayned abroad; which will be a means of rendring
<PB REF="11"/>him very fit, and apt for the generall society of that <HI>Nation</HI> amongst whom hee converses, and consequent∣ly the better qualifie him to frequent, without blush, such particular places, and persons by whom he may best profit himselfe in the Mysteries of their Polity, or what other perfection they are renowned for, according as his par∣ticular <HI>Genius</HI> and inclinations import him. But this hee shall never attain unto, till he begin to be somwhat ripe∣ned and seasoned in a place; for it is not every man that crosses the <HI>Seas,</HI> hath been of
<PB REF="12"/>an <HI>Academy,</HI> learned a <HI>Corran∣to,</HI> and speaks the <HI>Language,</HI> whom I esteem a Traveller (of which piece most of our <HI>English</HI> are in these countryes at present) but he that (in stead of making the <HI>Tour,</HI> as they call it) or, as a late Em∣bassador of ours <HI>facetiously,</HI> but sharply reproached, (like a Goose swimms down the Ri∣ver) having mastered the <HI>Tongue,</HI> frequented the <HI>Court,</HI> looked into their <HI>customes,</HI> been present at their <HI>pleadings,</HI> ob∣served their <HI>Military Discipline,</HI> contracted acquaintance with their <HI>Learned men,</HI> studied their <HI>Arts,</HI> and is famili∣ar
<PB REF="12"/>with their <HI>dispositions,</HI> makes this accompt of his time. The principal advantages which a Gentleman thus made, may observe, and apply, are <HI>Truth, Taciturnitie, facetiousnesse</HI> with∣out morosity, <HI>courage, modesty, hardinesse, patience, frugality,</HI> and an excellent temper in the Regiment of his health and <HI>Affections,</HI> especially in point of <HI>Drink</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which is our Northerne, Nationall, and most sordid of <HI>Vices.</HI> It is (I confesse) a thing extreamly difficult to be at all times, and in all places thus reserved, and as it were obliged to a Temper so <HI>Statick</HI> and exact among all
<PB REF="13"/>conversations; nor for mine own part, do I esteem it in all cases necessary, provided a man be furnished with such a stock of prudence, as he know how, and when to make use even of his companions ex∣travagancies, (as then frequent∣ly betraying more freely their inclinations, then at times of their more serious recolle∣ction, and first addresses.) Seeing I find it generally im∣possible for a <HI>Traveller</HI> to evade some occasions &amp; encounters, which (if he be at all practi∣cal) he will <HI>nolens volens,</HI> per∣ceive himself ingaged into at some one time or other. But
<PB REF="13"/>to recover this deviation, and return to our purpose; the vertues which our Traveller is to bring home when he doth <HI>Repatriare</HI> (as <HI>Solinus</HI> terms it) are either publick, such name∣ly as concern the service of his Country; or Private, and altogether personall, in order to his particular advantage and satisfaction: and, be∣leeve it <HI>Sir,</HI> if he reap some contentment extraordinary, from what he hath observed abroad, The pains, sollici∣tations, watchings, Perills, journeys, ill enterteinment, absence from Friends, and innumerable like inconveni∣ences,
<PB REF="14"/>joyned to his vast expen∣ces, do very dearly, and by a strange kind of extortion, pur∣chase that smal experience and reputation which he can vaunt to have acquired from abroad.</P>
<P>Those who boast of <HI>Philolo∣gicall</HI> Peregrinations (falsly so called) which they undertake meerly for the flourish and Tongue of a Place, possesse onely a Paret-vertue; It is one of the <HI>Shels</HI> of Travel (though I confesse, the kernel is not to be procured without it: And <HI>Topical;</HI> in which I finde the <HI>Dutch</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, generally most accurate and industrious; both of them serve well for the en∣tertainment
<PB REF="14"/>of Women and Children, who are common∣ly more imported with won∣der and <HI>Romance,</HI> then that solid and reall Emolument, which is (through these <HI>In∣struments</HI>) to be conveyed us from abroad.</P>
<P>It is written of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that hee saw many Cities indeed, but withall his Remarks of mens Manners and Customs, was ever preferred to his coun∣ting Steeples, and making <HI>Tours:</HI> It is this <HI>Ethicall</HI> and <HI>Morall</HI> part of Travel, which embellisheth a Gentleman, in the first place, having a due respect to the <HI>Religion,</HI> which
<PB REF="15"/>accomplisheth a Christian: In short, they are all severally very commendable, accom∣modated to <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Pro∣fessions;</HI> nor should a <HI>Ca∣valier</HI> neglect to be seen in all of them: But for that my in∣tention is here to make an Introduction onely into mine own OBSERVATIONS, I shall forbear to enter so large and ample a Field, as the through handling of this Argument would insensibly oblige mee to do, it having likewise been so abundantly treated of al∣most by every Pen which hath prevaricated on this <HI>Subject;</HI> though, in my slender judg∣ment,
<PB REF="15"/>and under favour, I must confesse, without any real and ingenuous satisfation either to Truth, or Curiosity.</P>
<P>To conclude (Sir) and con∣tract this tedious transgression, I conjure you to beleeve, that I offer nothing to you in this discourse, out of any the least self opinion, censure of other men, vanity, or ostentation. No, I am assured you will find me far enough from that <HI>IdiopathiaE,</HI> and common di∣stemper of <HI>Travellers;</HI> all I shall pretend being but to commu∣nicate unto you, how I have lost part of those seven yeares, and more; which, not be∣ing
<PB REF="16"/>(as in truth they ought to have been) wholly exerci∣sed in the Benefit I might have reaped from your so∣ciety at home, I am obliged in Honour, and for Justifi∣cation of my self, to render you an Accompt how they have been dispensed abroad. I am very conscious to my self, how much mine owne little interest hath suffered, during mine absence, in the judge∣ment of your stayed and more Thriving <HI>Geniuses,</HI> and such as might justly indeed derive <HI>Characters,</HI> and Prognosticks from a raw and unsettled spi∣rit, such as was mine: but
<PB REF="16"/>considering that all those tran∣sirory <HI>Accidents</HI> of Fo tune and the world, can no way farther extend themselves, then to a very imperfect satisfaction of our regular and honest Ap∣petites, (besides that which they ought yeeld unto o∣thers,) neither he who stayes at <HI>home,</HI> nor he that goes <HI>a∣broad,</HI> is (in mine opinion) to be altogether censured and bla∣med; and truely, he that can accommodate himself to so re∣tired and contemplative a life, as certainly that of a pure <HI>Country Gentlemans</HI> is, frees himself of an innumerable Host of troubles, and impor∣tunities
<PB REF="17"/>which a Traveller runs through, and is in a manner compelled to entertain. Con∣formable to that of the most incomparable</P>

<P><HI>But now to our</HI> TRAVELLER again.</P>
<P>The principall places of <HI>EUROPE,</HI> wherein a Gen∣tleman may, <HI>uno intuitu,</HI> behold as in a <HI>Theater</HI> the chief and most signall Actions which (out of his owne Countrey) concerne this later Age and part of the World, are the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> comprehending <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the divided <HI>Pro∣vinces;</HI> which is a perfect <HI>En∣cycle</HI>
<PB REF="19"/>and Synopsis of whatsoe∣ver one may elsewhere see in all the other Countryes of <HI>Europe;</HI> And for this end, I willingly recommend them to be first visited, no other∣wise, then do those who di∣rect us in the study of History to the reading first of some au∣thentick <HI>Epitome,</HI> or universall <HI>Chronology,</HI> besore we adventure to launch forth into that vast and profound <HI>Ocean</HI> of volumi∣nous Authours. From thence I would advise him to traverse <HI>Germany,</HI> (altogether contrary to the Vulgar Method) by rea∣son of that so usefull Tongue, which he will find very diffi∣cult,
<PB REF="20"/>and with much re∣gret, and many conflicts at∣tained unto, after the facill, and more smooth Languages are once throughly imbibed, not omitting (comparatively) even the <HI>French</HI> it self. From this <HI>Region</HI> you naturally slide into <HI>Italy,</HI> and then Em∣barquing for <HI>Spain,</HI> return by a direct course unto <HI>Paris;</HI> where indeed, I would have the Principall aboad of a Gen∣tleman to be, not only in Re∣lation to the <HI>Court,</HI> and <HI>exerci∣ses</HI> acquired in that City; but also in respect to his expenses. This may seem a <HI>Paradox</HI> to some; but for my part, I ne∣ver
<PB REF="20"/>found any <HI>wood</HI> to a great town; and when my Traveller hath cast it up, and made a true Audite of all <HI>Extraordinaries,</HI> he will find, what for <HI>removalls,</HI> and what for the perill of dis∣bauched and frequent <HI>colla∣tionings</HI> (for in all other little towns his acquaintance will be universall, the <HI>English</HI> per∣petually intervisiting, with a grosse ingredient of <HI>Dutch,</HI>) a very little, or inconsiderable disproportion in the total Ac∣compt.</P>
<P>Thus I propose <HI>France</HI> in the last place, for many other re∣spects which here I purposely omit to enumerate, that I may
<PB REF="21"/>avoid the <HI>taedium</HI> of so long a discourse; but especially, for this, that our <HI>Traveller</HI> may have the more time and reso∣lution to conquer the <HI>Lan∣guage,</HI> and go through those hardy and most eminent <HI>ex∣ercises</HI> which are there to bee learned in their choicest per∣fection and native lustre; af∣ter which, with a competent tincture of their best conver∣sation (for the over reserved∣nesse of the <HI>Italian,</HI> and severi∣ty of the <HI>Spanyard,</HI> as well as the blunt garb of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> would in an <HI>Englishman</HI> be a little Pal∣liated; for fear it become affe∣cted) he may return home,
<PB REF="21"/>and be justly reputed a most accomplished Cavalier.</P>
<P>To the other part of your Request, Sir, that I should give you some touches of the <HI>Low Countryes,</HI> and other pla∣ces (besides the wrong I should do to those perfect relations al∣ready extant) observing them at a time when my judgment was not altogether so mature, &amp; my self so much a <HI>Dutch Traveller,</HI> (as I have before rendred you the <HI>Character</HI>) I had rather make an <HI>Apology</HI> for what I have already, and promise yet to say, then proceed to depose allegations under mine own hand, of the losse of so much precious time;
<PB REF="22"/>and betray mine Ignorance.</P>
<P>Touching <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>States</HI> are so many, and their <HI>policy</HI> so different, that it would cost me more leasure then I have now to spend, to reduce, and discipline my scattered papers, and such indigested collections as require a more formal <HI>Me∣thod,</HI> and indeed, a better pen.</P>
<P>Nor could your <HI>Servant</HI> in truth, have been possibly indu∣ced to discover thus far his e∣gregious imperfections; did not your Arguments carry in them some specious reproach, as well as your Person so great an authority over me, when you please to perswade your
<PB REF="22"/>self the Advantage I must needs (say you) have had by my extraordinary Relations to Persons of affaire, as well as what I might happly in this case gather lawfully out of such as have the latest written on this Subject. So that how∣ever (and as indeed the very truth is) I was least of all in∣quisitive how others were go∣verned, finding it so difficult a <HI>Province</HI> to Regulate my self, yet mine endeavor to pacifie your importunity, and render you a demonstration of mine inabi∣lities to cōply with any future expectation of this Nature, hath in fine, extorted this from me, as an intire resignation &amp; sa∣crifice
<PB REF="23"/>of my reputation to that obedience which I professedly ow you, ever more preferring the satisfaction of so noble a Friend, to the very promulgati∣on of my own shame and most visible imbecilities.</P>
<P>So then (to approach our pur∣pose) seeing all those <HI>Nations</HI> (before spoken of) and several <HI>governments</HI> seem at this instant <HI>Epoche</HI> of time, to conspire as it were, and deferr to the present <HI>Grandezza</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> Empire, as likewise considering in what Relation we of <HI>England</HI> are con∣cerned, I have esteemed it best meriting my reflections and your patience, to finish, and dresse this <HI>Peece,</HI> as judging it

<PB N="2" REF="25"/>as it were, the sole victo∣rious and Flourishing Nation of <HI>Europe,</HI> in whose bosome <HI>Na∣ture</HI> hath even built this goodly Kingdome.</P>
<P>That where a Soveraigne Prince is able to maintain an ab∣solute and unarbritrary jurisdi∣ction over his subjects,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the example of the Romans, Athenians.</NOTE> or those frequent Exam∣ples of the <HI>Romanes</HI> and <HI>Atheni∣ans,</HI> whose desertion and aban∣doning of their Royall superiours fomented such confusion and di∣straction amongst the <HI>Noblemen</HI> and <HI>Plebeians,</HI> as could never be afterwards composed even to the ultimate destruction and lamen∣table <HI>catastrophe</HI> of those most il∣lustrious Republicks.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">S Denys the patron of F. deposed, to gratifie the B. Virgin.</NOTE> and to put his Kingdome for∣mally under the protection of the <HI>blessed Virgin,</HI> is esteemed good reason,

<PB N="6" REF="27"/>Heaven, &amp; reserved at <HI>Rhemes</HI> for the Royal <HI>Chrisme,</HI> we will give it leave to passe as a vulgar, yet not impolitick errour, or imperti∣nent tradition:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Daugh∣ters of Fr. sometimes married to private per∣sons, yet re∣serve their Titles and Surnanes.</NOTE> however, by the device aforesaid, the <HI>Daughters</HI> succeed not to the Crowne, some of them having oftentimes marti∣ed themselves unto private men, but still reserved their Titles, to∣gether with the <HI>Surname of France,</HI> which it seems is an ho∣nour permitted them during life, to shew from what <HI>stock</HI> they o∣riginally derived.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth and Character of the present King.</NOTE> 5. 1638 after the Queen his Mo∣ther had been <HI>above</HI> twenty yeers without Issue, as his production was almost miraculous (not to repeate here any bold disquisiti∣ons, with those who give them∣selves a liberty in these days, to speak evil of dignities) so is his person a Character doubtless of no lesse Majesty, and fair hopes; and certainly, if his Education be
<PB N="8" REF="28"/>fitted to the prognosticks of his Nature, he cannot but emerge a Prince of singular Qualities and e∣gregious perfections: This I am willing to adde from that <HI>Me∣chanick</HI> and Artificial breeding,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Artifice of the French Queen and publick mi∣nisters in the are kings Education.</NOTE> which men <HI>conceive</HI> some of his progenitors and neerest relation received; that so not being alto∣gether so dextrous and knowing in <HI>King-craft,</HI> as their high cal∣ling required, they might with less suspicion and more ease suf∣fer themselves to be governed, by the counsels and inclinations of such, whose <HI>mystery</HI> and ambiti∣on it hath ever been to continue by this means their Greatnesse, and reinforce their Authority.</P>
<P>This present King hath one onely Brother,

<P>Touching the <HI>Natural issue</HI> of the Kings of <HI>France</HI> (who are e∣ver
<PB N="12" REF="30"/>in this kind Country in very great Reputation and place, suta∣ble to their birth, (by their fa∣thers side) I cannot learne that the late King had any; nay, it is reported, he did so abhorre <HI>Pa∣liardize,</HI> that he scarce thought any other act to be sin in compa∣rison of it: contrary to the opinion of his wise Counselor and <HI>Cardi∣nall de Richlieu,</HI> who (as I have sometime heard) did use often to say, that a <HI>Concubine was the honest mans recreation:</HI> a Priest∣ly <HI>Aphorism,</HI> and spoken like a Churchman.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="31"/>their Relations; and the meaner by an inevitable constraint, as well as the example of their <HI>Chiefs,</HI> were compelled to a due submission; so that now the So∣vereignty of <HI>France</HI> is become so <HI>Independent</HI> and absolute, that albeit it do still reteine a shadow of the ancient form, yet it is, du∣ly considered, a thing heavenly wide and different:

<P>The <HI>office of the Grand Maistre de France,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The office of the Grand Maistre de France.</NOTE> is superintendent of the Kings house, and hath abso∣lute jurisdiction over all the domestick officers and Provisions of his <HI>Majesties</HI> table; and is a place of so supreme Authority, that it is seldome conferred save upon one of the Princes of the Blood; The <HI>Prince of Condy</HI> at present undeservedly inheriting his fathers charge therein.</P>

<P>Under the <HI>Grand Maistre,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subordinate officers to him.</NOTE> are many subordinate officers; as <HI>Maistres de Hostel, Butlers, Carvers, Gentlemen waiters,</HI> and a whole Regiment of o∣thers, which are reduced to no certain number: One thing is to be noted,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The high Chāberlain and officers subordinate to him.</NOTE></P>
<P>Next to the <HI>G.

<P>Lastly, the <HI>Grand Escuyer,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand Escuyer, his authority.</NOTE> or Master of the Horse, superinten∣dent of the <HI>Premier Escuyer</HI> and other Officers of the stables; his charge it is to march on Horse∣back before the King, bearing a Sword and Belt, when his Maje∣sty entreth into any City; but in those towns which have a <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI> he carries (in place thereof) a Casque of blew velvet <HI>semeèd</HI> with flowre <HI>de lys,</HI> his own horse Caparisoned with the like. He pretends also authority over the Masters of the <HI>Post,</HI> Offices of wonderfull gain; but it is now otherwise settled. The <HI>Master of the Horse hath</HI> likewise under him four and twenty <HI>Pages,</HI> who being the sons of prime Noblemen, are educated in all such exercises as become their quality.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secretaries of the Kings Chamber and Cabinet</NOTE></P>
<P>The King hath likewise foure <HI>Secretaries</HI> of his <HI>Chamber,</HI> and three of his Cabinet: to speak truth, the multitude of those who stile themselves <HI>Secretaries</HI> to the King, is such, that what with the greatnesse of their number, and inconsiderablenesse of most of their persons, the dignity of the charge is extremely Eclip∣sed.</P>

<P>Now before I proceed, som∣thing I should speak of those Royal officers which superintend the <HI>Kings pleasures</HI> and ordinary

<NOTE PLACE="marg">pertaining to the Kings pleasure: as Veneur, Fau connier' &amp;c.</NOTE> such is the <HI>Grand Veneur</HI> and <HI>Fauconnier,</HI> the chief <HI>Hunter,</HI> and master of the <HI>Game,</HI> places not only of very great ho∣nour, but also of Command; but a word of them shall suffice, as offices rather of dignity then policy.</P>
<P>Touching the officers belong∣ing in particular to the <HI>Queens houshold,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officers be∣longing to the Queens in particular much like those of the Kings.</NOTE> I shall herein like∣wise much contract my self, ha∣ving so amply discoursed of those which appertain unto the King; and the rather, in regard that in most of the <HI>subalternate,</HI> they so much resemble the one the other:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Except maids of honour.

She hath like∣wise her <HI>Grand Aumosnier</HI> and
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>a <HI>Premier Aumosnier,</HI> Ecclesia∣sticks, and the like, as before was said of the King.</P>
<P>And now having surveied the Principal officers of the <HI>Court,</HI> I know you are ready to enquire of me where the Guard of this great Monarch is all this while? I will but only mention the <HI>grand Prevost,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grand prevost, his command.</NOTE> at present the <HI>Mareshal d' Hoquencourt,</HI> whom I may not omit, and then I will draw them forth in their several or∣ders:</P>
<P>Not only the <HI>Grand Prevost</HI> is an office which extends it selfe over all the officers (already men∣tioned) which belong to his Majesties Houshold, but it hath likewise command absolute for six leagues round about <HI>Paris,</HI> and the <HI>Court,</HI> every way, which is in truth a very great and no∣ble jurisdiction; besides he is judg of all causes, as well <HI>civills,</HI> as <HI>criminels,</HI> which are incident in Court, and hath for this Re∣spect two <HI>Leutenans,</HI> Fifty <HI>Ar∣chers</HI>

<P><HI>Le Cent Gentils hommes,</HI> so named from their primary restri∣ction (albeit now double in num∣ber) they are called the Kings Company, and wait on him upon all days of Ceremony, and like occasions.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musquetiers on horsback</NOTE> Next</P>
<P>The <HI>Musquetiers on Horse∣back,</HI> which during the <HI>Regency</HI> have been dissolved, but are now in great probability to be reesta∣blished by the King: they were composed of a hundred and fifty horsemen, chosen out from a∣mongst the prime youth of the chiefest families of <HI>France,</HI> and at the first instituted by <HI>Lewis the thirteenth,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Late Kings curiosity in choosing them.</NOTE> father of this present King, who was so <HI>Physiognomi∣cally</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>punctual in their Election, that it is reported, he would ad∣mit none who were of a Red hair: These waited on his Ma∣jestie in Person when ever hee went abroad: but after these, and the more Ancient farr (who be∣sides their immediate attendance on the Person of the King wee are to accompt as principall and solid Forces of the State) are the <HI>Guards of French, Scotch, and Swisse:</HI> Of all whom, be∣cause those who approach neerest to the person of his Majesty are the <HI>Scotch</HI> (by an extraordinary &amp; special good fortune (it seems) ever esteemed faithfull to this King and Crown only, for they are very neer his person, and therefore called the <HI>Guard de La Manch</HI>) I will first begin with them.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotchguard or guard de la Manch.</NOTE> They consist of an hun∣dred <HI>Archers,</HI> and four <HI>Exempts,</HI> who carry a <HI>staffe</HI> or Trunche∣on in stead of an <HI>halberd,</HI> with the rest, from whence they are so denominated: These wait
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>on the King, and observe him in all motions, joyned also with some other of his Majesties guards, wherof some bear halberds, others Carabines, whether the King be at Table, in Coach, or in his bed∣chamber. But this guard of <HI>Scots,</HI> as sympathizing with the calamity of their Nation, is of late years very much impaired, divers French suborned in their places,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decay of the Scots at present.</NOTE> and many of their privi∣ledges lost and infringed, inso∣much as it seems at present to re∣tain rather a name then a real Being.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swisse</HI> (for being likewise strangers) I produce in the next place:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guard of Swisse.</NOTE> The guard of this grim Nation, is composed of <HI>sixteen Companies:</HI> but of these the more immediately attending as the Kings constant Guard are only an hundred of them, who all weare the Kings cloath, mar∣ching which halberds on their shoulders, drum always beating, and fife playing before his Maje∣sty,
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>when'ere he stirs but into the City.</P>
<P>Lastly, the <HI>Guard of French,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guard of F. or Regiment des Guards.</NOTE> called the <HI>Regiment des Guards,</HI> with the <HI>Swisse</HI> (composing two entire Companies) guard all the avenues and precincts of the <HI>Kings Palace:</HI> They are both of them two Regiments, whereof each is made up of 30 companies, consisting of two hundred men a piece, if full; and Besides these there is also another <HI>Companie de Gens d' Armes,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gens d'arms Cavalry.</NOTE> who are <HI>Cava∣lieres,</HI> &amp; serve quarterly on horse back.</P>
<P>Thus is this great <HI>Monarch</HI> so inviron'd with men of iron whereever he goes, that one who should meet him abroad, though but upon the most or∣dinary occasion, would suppose them an Army Marching rather to defend or invade some distres∣sed Province, then the private guard only of a Princes Person; so carefull have the Kings of <HI>France</HI> ever been to maintain this
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>principle of greatnesse and securi∣ty the very <HI>quintessence</HI> certainly of true Polity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">True signa∣tures of Ab∣solute Mo∣nar hy.</NOTE> and infalliblest signatures of an absolute jurisdi∣ction.</P>
<P>It would now peradventure be thought proper here to speak next of the <HI>Militia,</HI> having al∣ready placed the <HI>Guards,</HI> who in∣deed compose so considerable a part thereof: but because wee have now done with the court,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officers of State.</NOTE> we will in the next cast our eyes upon the State, and afterwards secure it.</P>
<P>But first a word or two tou∣ching the Kings <HI>Revenue,</HI> &amp; <HI>Coun∣sel;</HI>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grand Con∣seil.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is likewise another <HI>Councell,</HI> called the <HI>Grand con∣seil,</HI> in which also the <HI>Chancel∣lor</HI> presides virtually, though sel∣dom present in person; and this is Composed of four <HI>Presidents,</HI> and a hundred and fifty Coun∣sellers, who serve by <HI>Semester:</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>and this <HI>court</HI> is chiefly, and in∣deed only conversant in affaires <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> such as concerne <HI>Bishopricks, Priories, Hospitals,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>collation</HI> and <HI>presentation</HI> to Benefices in the jurisdiction ei∣ther of <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Pope</HI> within this Realme; and therefore here is the <HI>Kings</HI> Advocate, and <HI>proctor Generall</HI> continually attend∣ing.</P>
<P>And now (returning to our former division) we may remem∣ber that the more ancient officers of the <HI>Crown</HI> were likewise three: viz. The <HI>Connestable,</HI> the <HI>Mares∣chal</HI> and the <HI>Chancellor:</HI> I shall forbear a while to speak much of the two first, till I come to treat particularly concerning matters of warr:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Officers of State &amp; Ju∣stice. Chancelour of France.</NOTE> we are now in affaires of <HI>State</HI> and Justice, wherein this last in our division as chiefe and soveraign; his office is to dis∣patch and modifie all the <HI>Graces</HI> and <HI>gifts</HI> of the King, is <HI>keeper</HI> of the <HI>Great seale,</HI> with which hee confirmes all the <HI>Ordinances, E∣dicts,
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>declarations</HI> and <HI>pleasure</HI> of his Majesty; for which respect he hath in <HI>Parliament</HI> his seat on the left hand of the King, when he is there present. But there are no dayes properly design∣ed for <HI>sealing,</HI> that wholly de∣pending upon the will of the <HI>Chancellour.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Days and manner of Sealing.</NOTE> The manner thereof is this: The <HI>chancellour</HI> sits at the middle of a large Table, upon which is placed a <HI>cabinet</HI> or coffer (wherein there is locked all the publick <HI>seals</HI> of France) the key of which he carries about his neck: at the End of this Table are two <HI>Masters of Requests,</HI> with whom he may advise in case the affaire require it; and over a∣gainst the <HI>Chancelor</HI> one of the four <HI>Referendaries</HI> of France who reads all the <HI>Letters, Arrests,</HI> and other expeditions, which if ap∣proved, are accommodated with <HI>Yellow wax</HI> fitting and ready for the seale, and so put up into a box to be controuled by the <HI>Kings Secretaries,</HI> who must first
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>allow and <HI>Paragraph</HI> them, and then they are sealed: for <HI>Expe∣dition</HI> of highest consequence, as <HI>Treaties, Edicts, Abolitions,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>green wax:</HI> but the seals of <HI>Dauphine</HI> are in <HI>red:</HI> Moreover the <HI>character</HI> of the <HI>Chancelor</HI> is esteemed so sacred &amp; Inviolable, that it remains altogether indele∣ble but by <HI>death</HI> onely;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guard des sceaux.</NOTE> yet not∣withstanding upon decadency, or disgrace with the King, there is commonly one called <HI>Gard des Sceaux,</HI> who executeth his charg &amp; hath also the same authority; for the <HI>Seales</HI> may be taken away at his Majesties pleasure, but not the <HI>Chancelorship,</HI> which as it is never to dye, but with his Person, so may he not put on <HI>Mourning</HI> for the <HI>King himself,</HI> his <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Mother</HI> if any of them decease, as being insensible of all other <HI>Relations,</HI> and consi∣derations besides the sole interest of the <HI>People:</HI> his habite is a Robe of <HI>black Velvet</HI> doubled, or lined with Crimson plush: be∣fore
<PB N="48" REF="48"/>him goe two <HI>Searjeants,</HI> with chains of Gold, who bear 2 rich <HI>maces</HI> of gold on their shoulders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Secretaries of State</HI> and commands of the King are <HI>four</HI> in number;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Secretaries of State.</NOTE> whose functions, for being different, deserve to bee mentioned in the next place. One of these Secretaries is for Expedi∣tions altogether <HI>forraign:</HI> one for affaires <HI>Ecclesiasticall</HI> and be∣nefices; a third for matters only appertaining to the <HI>Kings house,</HI> and the fourth, serves for affairs and concernements of <HI>war;</HI> and thus have they the whole King∣dom so <HI>cantoniz'd</HI> betwixt them, that upon all particular Exi∣gences of the <HI>Provinces,</HI> e∣very one knows his division: In <HI>Court</HI> and presence of the King, they waite alternatively by <HI>Months;</HI> for he uses them likewise in affaires of the <HI>ca∣binet,</HI> which for not being mat∣ter of State, hee will not have made known or divul∣ged.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
<P>Lastly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Masters of Requests.</NOTE> The <HI>Masters of Request</HI> (of whom there are at present no lesse then seven∣ty) are as it were <HI>Assessors</HI> of the <HI>Chancellour,</HI> and compose the body of the Court of <HI>Parli∣ament,</HI> (of which we shall short∣ly speak) and have their Seats next to the <HI>Counsellers,</HI> but not exceeding four at a time. In absence of the <HI>Presidents,</HI> they preside also in many other <HI>Judi∣catures,</HI> and <HI>Bailliages:</HI> these make report and sign the <HI>Request of Justice,</HI> and sometimes the af∣faires of the <HI>Exchequer:</HI> they are likewise many times chosen for <HI>Extraordinary Embassades,</HI> as wel as Commissioners for his Ma∣jesty in the Cities and Provinces, where they judg and determine upon all affairs of the Crowne with most absolute power and authority.</P>
<P>The rest of the Officers more immediately belonging to the Kings Revenue I have touched at large already. I
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>come now to the <HI>Parlia∣ments of France,</HI> of whom there hath hitherto been so much talke.</P>
<P>The <HI>Justice of France</HI> (in the equal dispensation whereof should be the glory and diadem of a Prince in Peace,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament of France,</NOTE> as is the multitude of people his visible strength in warr) is doubtlesse very good, but wonderfully ill executed; which happens through the sordid corruption of such as dispense it for mony and favour, without which there is nothing to be hoped for in this <HI>Kingdom:</HI> and good reason there should bee some gaine made of that which the dividers thereof buy so dear, purchasing their places and offices at such excessive charges, that they are constrained to fell their Vertue to him who bidds most for it.

<P>But the more principall Nerve of the French <HI>Power</HI> consists in his <HI>Forces at Land;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Land Forces</NOTE> and amongst them (as hath already been touched) chiefly his <HI>Cavalry,</HI> which is of strength and spectacle both of admiration and gallantry,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spanish and Fr.

<PB N="90" REF="69"/>the <HI>premises</HI> being changed, the Conclusion must needs remain, considering that the <HI>Cause</HI> being taken away, through their present exercise, and perpetual <HI>War,</HI> the <HI>Effect and Defect</HI> cannot of con∣sequence ensue, as we have already sufficiently proved: or admit it were yet so, I hope the <HI>Suisse</HI> and other faithful <HI>Mercenaries</HI> to that Crown, abundantly sup∣ply all these wants and prejudices; most of which, yet notwithstand∣ing, for my part, were, I think, first hired rather out of considera∣tion of <HI>diversion,</HI> and since <HI>custom,</HI> then otherwise out of any pure necessity. That likewise which made the <HI>Armies</HI> of <HI>France</HI> so inconsiderable for native Foot Soldiers, may with much reason too (if we please) be attributed unto <HI>Lewis the Eleventh</HI> his dis∣arming of the <HI>Commons;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consequence of disarming the Com∣mons.</NOTE> by which advice, the <HI>King</HI> indeed became more <HI>absolute</HI> at home amongst his <HI>Vassals,</HI> but a great deal less for∣midable <HI>abroad</HI> amongst his <HI>Ene∣mies:</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="69"/>And herein it was, that his <HI>Neighbors</HI> stood him in stead.</P>
<P>Another thing rendring this <HI>Kingdom</HI> very considerable for an <HI>Army,</HI> is,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their opini∣on and hate of the En∣glish.</NOTE> they have a naturall dread and hate to the <HI>English,</HI> as esteeming us for the most part, a fierce, rude, and barbarous <HI>Nati∣on:</HI> but their <HI>antipathy</HI> to a <HI>Spa∣niard</HI> is deadly and irreconcilable.</P>
<P>For their <HI>Bodies,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stature,</NOTE> they are both Sexes of <HI>mean stature,</HI> rather in <HI>good point,</HI> then either lean or grosse;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">complexion,</NOTE> generally, swa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of com∣plexion, except such as have mix∣ed towards the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>East:</HI> the <HI>Women</HI> have commonly <HI>black eyes, rare teeth,</HI> and <HI>sweet voyces;</HI> and certainly, so gentile and na∣turall an <HI>addresse</HI> even in their
<PB N="107" REF="77"/>most ordinary actions, that one may as easily distinguish them by <HI>it,</HI> as their <HI>tongues:</HI> In fine,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">promptness,</NOTE> they are extremely <HI>prompt,</HI> and imagine to comprehend all upon an <HI>in∣stant,</HI> which makes many to give out and tire in the journey before they be half way: for all which,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cheerful supinity of the people.</NOTE> and their oppressions to boot, there lives not under the <HI>cope</HI> of <HI>heaven</HI> a more <HI>frank galiard,</HI> and <HI>supine</HI> people: howbeit many of them will not stick to <HI>repine,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Victories unwelcom, to the Fr. and why?</NOTE> and censure even their own <HI>Victories</HI> and successes, whereof every one but seems to add a heavier weight to their <HI>Oppression.</HI></P>
<P>Now,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The best &amp; most com∣pendious Map of a Country.</NOTE> as every <HI>Metropolitan</HI> and <HI>Royal</HI> City is likely the best <HI>Map</HI> of the <HI>Country</HI> wherein it stands; so may <HI>Paris</HI> be esteem'd the most exact <HI>Compendium</HI> of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paris is a City</HI> in a <HI>Ring,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paris, site, Edifices, &amp;c.</NOTE> whereof the <HI>Louvre</HI> or Palace of the King is the <HI>Diamond:</HI> And truly, considering the vastnesse of its circumference, so incompara∣bly
<PB N="108" REF="78"/>built all of the <HI>living Rock,</HI> whereupon it is seated (which for beauty, easie working, and lastingness, renders it a prehemi∣nence above many more costly Materials) I think no <HI>City</HI> in the whole world equalizes it. I have seen <HI>Naples, Rome, Florence, Ge∣noa,</HI> and <HI>Venice;</HI> all stately Cities, and full of Princely <HI>Fabricks;</HI> but then I compare the extent, and here are many <HI>Centuries</HI> of <HI>Noblemens Houses,</HI> both within the Town and the Environs, which altogether approach, if not exceed the best of them. This I will boldly affirm, that for the <HI>Streets, Sububrs,</HI> and <HI>common buil∣dings,</HI> it infinitely excels any City else in <HI>Europe:</HI> for publick <HI>Edi∣fices,</HI> some of the <HI>Hospitals</HI> are fair Foundations and handsome Piles; but the <HI>Convents</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> come far short of the Towns before recited: yet that of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> and <HI>Jesuites,</HI> are not much inferiour to some of the best and most modern Pieces
<PB N="109" REF="78"/>of <HI>Architecture</HI> extant.</P>
<P>The <HI>River of Seine,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of Seine.</NOTE> which di∣vides it, is nothing comparable, for sweetnesse and good conditi∣on, to our <HI>Royal</HI> River of <HI>Thames:</HI> yet it would deceive any man in the <HI>use,</HI> when he shall seriously examine and consider the huge <HI>Vessels</HI> of burden (though not <HI>Ships</HI>) it brings up, full of <HI>Com∣modities</HI> and necessary <HI>Provisions.</HI> In conclusion, <HI>Paris</HI> wants nothing but <HI>clean Streets,</HI> and a redresse of the multitude of <HI>Coaches, La∣quays,</HI> and throngs of <HI>Mankind;</HI> with all which,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of people &amp;c. in Paris too great.</NOTE> it is generally so <HI>pestered,</HI> that it appears a miracle to me, how so many <HI>backs</HI> are <HI>clothed,</HI> and <HI>bellies</HI> maintained (in a Town of no eminent Staple) as you may behold in one day, if you walk the streets and publick <HI>Carfours;</HI> Most of the <HI>Houses</HI> ordinarily harbouring <HI>six,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">True cause of our re∣proaching their Na∣stinesse.</NOTE> as often <HI>ten families</HI> betwixt <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>hell,</HI> the <HI>Garrets</HI> and the <HI>Cellars:</HI> and this I take to be the true cause of that <HI>Nastinesse</HI> which we usu∣ally
<PB N="110" REF="79"/>impute to the <HI>Nation: Per∣sons of Quality,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persons of quality more neat and sumptuous then any in England.</NOTE> and such as have room enough, being far more <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>sumptuous</HI> in their houses, then the best of us here in <HI>England,</HI> however we arrogate the <HI>contrary.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Extent of this City,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extent of Paris and London dif∣ficult to be compared, and why?</NOTE> it hath been, and is still a great controversie amongst our Countrey-men <HI>Travellers,</HI> which is the larger, <HI>This</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> every one speaks according to his inclinations: But the <HI>figures</HI> of them both are so different, that it would be a very diffi∣cult matter to reconcile them, by making an exact tryall: and peradventure, all things consi∣dered; there is as yet no very great inequality: but if we may conjecture from the buildings at present,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prodigious increase of buildings.</NOTE> and prodigious enlarge∣ment of their <HI>Suburbs</HI> on all sides, what a little time and <HI>Peace</HI> will render it, it must, without doubt, in a short time outgrow the contention, and far exceed it.
<PB N="111" REF="79"/>for I finde no end of their ere∣cting not onely of particular <HI>houses,</HI> but even of whole <HI>streets,</HI> and those so incomparably fair and <HI>uniform,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beauty of the now new Edifices of Paris.</NOTE> that you would i∣magine your self rather in some <HI>Italian Opera,</HI> where the diversity of <HI>Scenes</HI> surprise the beholder, then beleeve your self to be in a reall <HI>Citie.</HI> This is onely to be observed in their prime <HI>Build∣dings</HI> and <HI>Palaces,</HI> that the best <HI>Fabricks</HI> commonly promise less towards the <HI>Front</HI> or Street, then you will finde them within the <HI>Court;</HI> which is caused by the high walls and <HI>tarraces</HI> that thwart them: a piece of <HI>Mode∣stie,</HI> which in other <HI>Appearances</HI> and outsides they do not usually practise.</P>
<P>But what our <HI>City of London</HI> hath not in houses and <HI>Palaces,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">London for Shops, Ta∣verns, o∣ther drink∣ing Schools, and Noise, exceeding all C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies of the world.</NOTE> she hath in <HI>Shops</HI> and <HI>Taverns;</HI> which render it so open by day, and cheerfull in the night, that it appears to be a perpetuall <HI>Wake,</HI> or <HI>Wedding</HI> to the behol∣der;
<PB N="112" REF="80"/>for so <HI>mad</HI> and lowd a <HI>Town,</HI> is no where to be found in the whole world.</P>
<P>The <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Policy</HI> of this <HI>Prevesté</HI> is exercised by <HI>Judges,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governmēt of Paris.</NOTE> called <HI>Lieutenants Civils</HI> and <HI>Criminels;</HI> who, for pur∣chasing their <HI>Offices</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI> sell their Justice at extraordinary rate, to such as have use of that rare <HI>Commodity.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prevost of Merchand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> They have al∣so a <HI>Prevost of the Merchands, &amp; les Eschevins,</HI> which is an Of∣fice more resembling our <HI>Re∣corder</HI> and <HI>Sheriff,</HI> then <HI>Major:</HI> Likewise the <HI>Archbishop</HI> hath a spirituall jurisdiction here;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbishop of Paris, &amp;c.</NOTE> as also some particular <HI>Abbots</HI> and <HI>Priors:</HI> And with all this, I cannot say, it is well governed; the disorders of every day and night will convince me,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disorders of Paris in the night, how they might be prevented</NOTE> if I should, when so many execrable <HI>Murthers</HI> and <HI>Villanies</HI> are com∣mitted in the streets; an incon∣venience which might yet be easily prevented, if they would but imitate our <HI>Policy,</HI> and form
<PB N="113" REF="80"/>their <HI>Watches</HI> of constant and responsible persons.</P>
<P>Neither is the <HI>strength</HI> of this renowned City any thing conside∣rable in stresse of a <HI>Siege,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength of Paris no∣thing in a siege.</NOTE> or re∣spect of other naturall advantage, save onely fire: nay, so open it is to the <HI>Conquerour,</HI> that <HI>S<SUP>r</SUP> De∣nys</HI> (which lies but two leagues remote from it) hath oftentimes been the <HI>Frontier of France;</HI> &amp; had not the late <HI>Mareschal de Gassion</HI> as deerly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mareschal de Gastion preserved Paris from the Spany∣ard.</NOTE> as bravely purchased their <HI>Liberty</HI> at the signal battel of <HI>Rocroy,</HI> the <HI>Spainyard,</HI> 'tis be∣leeved, might (without the least obstacle, have marched up to the very gates of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>But the incomparable <HI>Aire</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> is that which fortifies the <HI>In∣habitants:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Aire of Paris cele∣brated.</NOTE> so that very seldom hath a <HI>Plague</HI> or other <HI>Epidemical Con∣tagion</HI> made here that havock and lamentable <HI>devastation,</HI> which it so frequently doth in our putrifi∣ed <HI>climate,</HI> and accidentally suf∣focated <HI>City:</HI> contrary to that <HI>Vulgar</HI> (but most false) <HI>Traditi∣on,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="81"/>which I find in every mans mouth;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ordina∣ry tradition amongst us, that the plague is ne∣ver out of Paris, refu∣ted.</NOTE> that the <HI>Pestilence</HI> is never out of <HI>Paris:</HI> but this (be∣sides the <HI>siccity</HI> of the aire) many <HI>Naturalists</HI> ascribe to the over <HI>sulphurous</HI> exhalations of the streets, and dry attracting quality of the <HI>Plaster,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quality of the Plaster of Paris.</NOTE> which, bears or gives the <HI>Name</HI> to this <HI>goodly ci∣ty.</HI></P>

<P>Thus, Sir, by the <HI>as∣sistance</HI> of your <HI>Patience,</HI> I have adventured to draw the <HI>Curtain,</HI> dis∣covering a very ample <HI>Theatre,</HI> in a short time, and represented it in as
