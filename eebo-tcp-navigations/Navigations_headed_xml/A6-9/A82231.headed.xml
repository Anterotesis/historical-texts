<HEAD>A Declaration of the Representations of the Officers of the NAVY, <HI>Concerning the Impeached Members of Parliament Transported beyond the Seas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Diurnall came to our hands on Mun∣day <HI>August</HI> 16. which hath a passage, as we apprehend it, that hath done us unsuffe∣rable wrong, we blesse God, our wayes are open to him that knows our Innocency: And to Vindicate our selves, we have upon serious thoughts, not to adde to the sad diffe∣rences of the times, VVe had rather suffer quietly; but however we desire to cleare our selves, to those who are our friends, of those scandalls which so much tend to the prejudice of us.</P>
<P>Those Gentlemen are now aboard, who have seen and heard the Truth, and will no question satisfie accordingly, when they re∣turne: In the meane time we shall faithful∣ly, as in Gods presence certifie the Truth.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P> The Members five of them tooke Bark at a Town by <HI>Quinborrough:</HI> Gave one <HI>Green</HI> 10 <HI>li.</HI> in hand, and were to give him 10 <ABBR><HI>li.</HI></ABBR> more at their Landing at <HI>Callis,</HI> and to se∣cure his Barque out and in at 60 <HI>li.</HI> Upon which he having received the money, put another to saile in her as Master; himselfe went and got a VVarrant, saying the Mem∣bers were gone without his consent in his Barque: And with his VVarrant came to <HI>Feversham,</HI> &amp; there told the Inhabitants that some Parliament men were gone away with 16 Chests and Portmantles full of Treasure: upon which one <HI>Lamming,</HI> Master of a Dog∣er-boat caused Drums to beat, thinking to gain the money, and came after them, they taking in a Pilate here, he came by Captain <HI>Pacy,</HI> Capt. of a small frigot, and told him that some Parliament men were run away with a great deale of treasure: Upon which Captain <HI>Pacy</HI> let slip his Anchors, set Saile &amp; made after them, and the Doger-boat never came neer them: but Capt. <HI>Pacy</HI> shooting one shot, they came in to him, &amp; he brought them into the <HI>Downes:</HI> Sir <HI>Philip Stapleton</HI> very sick of a flux (who since is dead of the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>sicknesse at <HI>Callice:</HI>) They lay aboard us all night. The Vice-admirall sent Capt. <HI>Lam∣ming,</HI> for Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> to see what they had to shew for their leaving the Kingdome, and to see if they had any thing against them: but they not returning till a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Clock next day, he judging they were ashamed of ma∣king such an untrue story, be called a Coun∣cell of Warr: and there they produced their severall, passes, Dated two dayes before, grounded on an Order of the House of Commons upon their first Impeachment; which by the Councell of Warre was per∣used: and at last it was resolved to send Sir <HI>George Askue,</HI> Capt <HI>Crawley,</HI> Capt <HI>Pacy,</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Penrose,</HI> and divers others, to search their Vessell, which was accordingly, and exactly done, to their very pockets, and there was not much found, (onely they had Bills of Exchange).</P>
<P>So the Viceadmirall and the Councell of Warre not daring, having no Order to the contrary, and seeing Mr. <HI>Speakers</HI> Passe so lately Dated, did dismisse them: in their lit∣tle Vessell to passe.</P>
<P>About two houres after their dismission
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>comes <HI>Lamming</HI> and <HI>Green,:</HI> and the Vice-admirall being at Dinner sent for them in: Saw a VVarrant from the Captain of the Block-house, Directed <HI>To all Constables, &amp;c.</HI> He asked them which they thought would most direct him to act by? a private Cap∣tains VVarrant, or an Order of both Hou∣ses of Parliament, and Passes under the <HI>Speakers</HI> hand? And that he was account∣able for what he had done to both Hou∣ses.</P>
<P>He also sent Major <HI>Keme</HI> to intreat Col∣lonell <HI>Twaselltons</HI> Trooper to come in and drink a glasse of Wine, which he did: and we referre to him, if he had an uncivill word aboard.</P>
<P>Onely Major. <HI>Keme</HI> told Capt. <HI>Lamming,</HI> were he in the Army of the Councell of Warre, he would Vote him to be hanged, and he gave him this reason, that he knew he had a Commission in his pocket, signed by some of those Members to raise a Com∣pany of Sea-men, to oppose the Army, and that he had received ten pounds to that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>His Commission he shewed the Vice-Admirall
<PB N="11" REF="4"/>and as aboard in Parchment, and this was all the reviling language.</P>
<P>Then for Threatning; this we know, that he hath been out in a Dogerboate all the Sum∣mer: And hath when he should have kept Sea, been lying a Shoare at <HI>Shoarum, Ha∣stings,</HI> &amp;c. Drinking drunk and hath abu∣sed, and had not the <HI>Viz-admirall</HI> found out his Knavery have cheated the State; upon which he sent him in. VVe as divers Cap∣taines and other Officers, and Chaplins that stood by to the number of one hundred can testify. And God is our record it is truth: And further I can assure this.</P>
<P N="1">1 That Collo <HI>Hollis</HI> was not there then as is reported, but Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> Sir <HI>Phillip Stapleton,</HI> Sir <HI>John Clotworthy,</HI> Sir <HI>Wil∣liam Lewis,</HI> and Col: <HI>Long.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 That Captaine <HI>Lamming</HI> is only Pot-va∣lient, preferred from slavery in <HI>Argeire</HI> to be Master of a Doger-boatc last yeere, and he nor any with them ever fired a Musket.</P>
<P N="3">3 That the dismission was not by the Viz-Admirall but by a cleare voce of a Coun∣cell of War.</P>
<P N="4">4 That we neither reviled him nor threatn∣ed
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>him for that Act, Major <HI>Keme</HI> tould him he having such a Commission about him he might be hanged for beating up Drummer in the Country without other order.</P>

<P>THere is a Paper of the <HI>27</HI> instant, (Intituled <HI>His Majesties Declaration</HI>) made publick, it is patronized upon the King, but I assure you His Majesty is much abused in it: he hath many time to my self and others, expressed, not onely his dis-avowing, but utter dislike of it; at first it something troubled him, but is being so unlike any thing of his, and so contrary to his known intentions, be was con∣fident it would not gain credence with any; yet since, hearing that di∣vers both in City and Country, and Army, were so fondly credulous as to deem it to be His Majesties, and so were much offended at it, it was the Kings Command I should certifie my friends how extremely he is wronged, and truely Sir, you would doe the King but right, and dis∣charge I conceive no more then your own duty to indevour the finding out the Author, and making him exemplary, and I am confident the King expects so much Justice therein.</P>
<P>Here is little newes in Court more then this, that the King yester∣day was a hunting in <HI>New Parke,</HI> killed a <HI>Stag</HI> and a <HI>Buck,</HI> af∣terwards dined at <HI>Syon,</HI> stayed three or foure houres with his Child∣ren, and then returned to <HI>Hampton,</HI> where there is great resort of all sorts of people to him, but not so many Cavaliers as is reported, it is confessed, no Gentleman is debarred the liberty of kissing the Kings, hand, yet no stranger stayes tong, we have fresh and fresh appear∣ances, the faces which appeare in the morning, you seldome see in the afternoone; at the farthest, but the next day. The Lord <HI>Conoway</HI> hath taken his leave of the Court for present, I have no more to ac∣quaint you with; I shall only again mind you, that to vindicate the King by discovering and punishing the Libeller, cannot but give great satisfa∣ction to his Majesty.</P>
