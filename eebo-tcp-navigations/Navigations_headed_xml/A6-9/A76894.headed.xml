<HEAD>A Bloudy Fight at Sea, between the Par∣liaments ships, under the Command of Captain Vice-Admiral Clerk, Captain Penington, and Captain Armstrong; and the Hollanders, commanded by Vice-Admiral Frederick.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 12 of this instant March, we discovered a Fleet of ships coasting along the Channel, whose pride and insolen∣cy, did much exasperate the spirits of our
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>Officers and Souldiers, who making towards them, found them to be Hollanders; whereupon Captain Johnson haled to them, demanding from whence they came, and where bound: the Dutch Captains answer'd, That they scorn'd to give an account to English-men. Then Captain Johnson required them to strike sayl in obedience and honour to the States of England; but that seemed more detestable unto them; who said, That although they never cut off a Kings Head, yet they were the ancientest States: Why then have at you, reply'd Capt. Johnson, I'le have some of your heads before I leave you; and withall, gave them a broad side, &amp; immediatly tackt about and gave them another, which did great exe∣cution both above and below Decks: The Hollan∣der being exceedingly inraged thereat, gave him a gallant Volley of 7 broad sides; but were answer'd treble by the rest of the English ships; who by that time were come up close to engage; insomuch that a sharp and bloudy fight began, which continued for the space of 3 hours; being performed with great gallantry on both sides: But at last Captain Stokes coming in, did so terrifie them with round shot, and Hand-Granadoes, that he soon fired one, sunk ano∣ther, and boarded a third; which the rest of the Fle∣mins perceiving, declined engagement, and with a
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>fresh Gale sailed towards the Coast of France. We had them in chase for the space of 5 hours, but night approaching, we were inforced to desist. These are said to be New-Commission Pyrats, set forth with Letters of Mart from the Scotch-King, and not by the Authority of the States of Holland. Their losse we conceive to be very great; for each ship that were sunk, carryed 34 pieces of Ordnance, &amp; man'd with 80 men, stout knaves I'le assure you. In this conflict we lost about 27 men; the Enemy neer up∣on two hundred.</P>
<P>The Hollander hath set forth a Declaration to raise 60000 Horse and Foot; and 300 Sayl of ships; but their design is variously spoken of.</P>
<P>Yet great are the Contests between the Burgo∣masters and the Bores; for the latter doth threaten to sequester their Estates, and bring them to a Tryall for their lives, if they will not take a course to defend and assist them at Sea. And some Tumults and Ri∣sings have already been in Zealand, Rotterdam, Dort, Delf, and at the Hague, where many were both slain and wounded, and amongst the rest some English, which the Mutiniers chiefly aymed at, and brand them with the most infamous Badge of Tray∣tors and Conspirators to their Religion and Liber∣ties; &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere hath been a great and imperial Coun∣cel held at Munster in Germany, by the Am∣bassadors of 13 Christian Kings, Princes, and Dukes; At which Diet, they took into considera∣tion the present state and condition of many exiled Princes; and amongst the rest, a Conference arose touching the King of Scots; but nothing dne therein (at present) by reason of other weighty and emergent businesses, which call them to a Work of far greater concernment; and may also prove fatal, if not timely prevented: For the Great Turk, and his Bashaw have taken the field with seven hundred thousand Horse and Foot, and are resolved (if possi∣ble) to make a great devastation and inroad upon Christendom this Summer: But great is the care of the Emperour of Germany, the 7 Christian Princes of Italy, the Queen of Sweden, the Prince of Tran∣silvania, and Prince Frederick of Malta, to raise a formidable Power, and to unite and joyn with the Venetians, both in an offensive and defensive War against the Turks; And in pursuance thereof, a League is concluding between the aforesaid Prin∣ces; who have had a large consultation thereupon; But that which is thought most requisite and feasi∣ble at present, is, the sending of a Summons to all Christendom, for Warlike Provisions to be made a∣gainst
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>the Enemies thereof; And indeed great rea∣son have they so to do; for never was a more po∣tent and irresistable Army raised these many years, as now the Turks and Janisaries have raised. Yet notwithstanding, Prince Philip (the third Son to the Queen of Bohemia, and General to the Stases of Ve∣nice) hath given them a great Overthrow neer the Isle of Candia, and kill'd, taken, and routed about threescore thousand men: This Overthrow doth exceedingly retard the Enemies Design; and as it is a great prejudice to them, so it is a great advantage to Christendom; And his Highnesse Prince Philip hath embraced this opportunity; who by the assist∣ance of the Divine Power, hath obtained another great Victory against the Janisaries: Since which Atchievements, he is called Philip the Great; a Gen∣tleman of a gallant temper, and endow'd with ex∣cellent Properties and Vertues, both for prudence, wisdom, and magnanimity of Spirit: He is even be∣come as great a Terrour to the Turks, as Alexander the Great was to the Christians.</P>
<P>The King of Scots hath sent the Lord Wilmot with a Message to the Princes of Italy, imploring Supplies and Accommodation, suitable to his pre∣sent Necessities and Condition; but they have re∣turned Answer, That by reason of the home-bred
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>divisions, and forreign Preparations of the Enemy in severall parts against the Christian Territories; they could not answer his expectation at present, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Duke of Malta hath declared, that he will give his Royal Assent to the Union, and that he will raise forty thousand Horse and Foot, to joyn with the Christians against the Turks; and in pursuance thereof hath granted a Commission to Prince Fre∣derick, Landgrave of Hesse, to command in chief un∣der his Highness Prince Philips.</P>
<P>It is reported, that Lieu. Col. Lilburn is made captain of a Man of War for the States of Holland; and that he hath received Power and Instructions, to fire, sink, or take, any ships whatsoever, that shall be declared Enemies to the United Provinces.</P>
<P>Some also relate, that he hath sent a Letter to the Lord General, puting his Exceliency in mind of his Protestation at Huntington; wherein he desires him to stand up against Oppression; to propagate the Gospel; to preserve the liberty of the People, and to maintain the Laws of the Land in its purity with∣out corruption or bribery.</P>
