<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Returne your
Papers by that
hand which
brought them:
I have runne swiftly over
<PB REF="8"/>
your <HI>Itinerary,</HI> but am not
so impudent to pro∣nounce
my thoughts on
it; unlesse I had more
time or a steaddier Brain;
for after my riding
three dayes poast I am fit∣ter
for sleep then Epistles.
The thing most observ∣able
of all your Travells
is your selfe, who are able
to graspe so much of the
World, when 'tis not
twice ten yeares since you
came into it. I conceive
it flowes from your good
nature, thus to set markes
on your severall Stages,
that the Prints are visi∣ble
<PB REF="8"/>
to your freinds and
Country: 'Twas usefully
done, since now so ma∣ny
of us are doom'd to
wander, not like <HI>Cain</HI>
for drawing blood, but for
asking Peace. Did others
follow your example,
this <HI>unhabitable</HI>-VVorld
would have more Man∣ners
and lesse News. Many
<HI>Itineraries</HI> I have seene in
Latine, few in English,
and those so partiall, that
Countries are describ'd
(as <HI>Committees</HI> do Gentle∣men)
not as they are,
but as they would have
them. 'Tis a Noble Me∣ditation
<PB REF="9"/>
how <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Italy</HI> (two great Cham∣pions)
looke over the
Water, Daring and
threatning and watching
each other; 'twas once so
'twixt <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI>
Such as have seen them
will say how exactly
you shew us <HI>Rome, Ve∣nice,
Florence, Naples,
Milan, Genua, Bolonia,
Padua,</HI> and those other
Glories beyond the <HI>Alpes:</HI>
to me this great limbe of
the World <HI>(Italy</HI> you
know is a leg) not your
foot but your hand hath
gone over as a brief, ele∣gant,
<PB REF="9"/>
smart Anatomist.
But I am sorry you men∣tion
<HI>Virgils</HI> Tombe, for
now people will thinke
hee is mortall; sure his
owne Pile (built three
stories high, of <HI>Eclo∣gues,
Georgicks,</HI> and
<HI>Aeneads)</HI> will last as long
as the round World. In
this Journey others went
before you, so as you
are forc'd almost upon
gleanings, yet here (as
in the Field) gleanings
put togeather are the best
of the Corne. Now you
are come home, you'l
have stranger sights then

any abroad; you'l see
<HI>Great Brittaine</HI> a <HI>Floating
Island,</HI> and the most ver∣tuous
<HI>Monarch</HI> under
Heaven cast into a small
Isle as on some plank in
a great Ship-wrack. You'l
find <HI>London</HI> (like the
Spleen in the Body) hath
rendred other Parts poore

<HI>England</HI> is but one great
Towne; this <HI>London</HI> all

and shee is so much cock∣nay

a Kingdome without a

you'l grant wee have
a <HI>thorough Reformation.</HI>
But two houres since I
saw a better sight then
<HI>Italy</HI> affords; 'tis His
Highnesse the Prince of
<HI>Wales,</HI> who for Soule and
Body is sure the most
hopefull Prince in the

comming hether this after∣noone
brings a floud of

<HEAD>An Introduction to
<HI>ITALY.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is preeminence
enough methinkes
for <HI>Italy</HI> that shee
did then sway the
Allcoercive Scep∣ter
on Earth, when our Redee∣mer
assum'd the flesh. To her
we owe our Civility; shee pur∣chast
it by conquests in the Le∣vant;
Propogated it by Victo∣ries
in the North, till dispairing
of a Farther Plantation the
Picts wall was her <HI>Vltima Thule;</HI>
perhaps least that people should
have stumbled at the Innovati∣on.</P>
<P><PB REF="13"/>
To bee Retrograde on this
subject were to rob History of
her birthright, to insist on my
owne ocular observation but
veniall vsury.</P>
<P>There are three evitable dan∣gers
that divert some from this
Voyage; the first is the heates
of the Climate; A second, that
horrible (in Report) Inquisiti∣on;
the last, Hazard of those
mercilesse Out Lawes <HI>Banditas.</HI></P>
<P>The first may bee allayd by
Moderation, the second preven∣ted
by discretion; the last avoi∣ded
by the defence of those
states you passe through.</P>
<P>This Duke of florence quite
extirpated that savage Race
out of his Dominions by raising
a competent number; that per∣sonated
Robbers and joynd in
league with the reall ones till
they fouud opportunity to dis∣patch
them.</P>
<P><PB REF="13"/>
As there is connivance at the
<HI>Luterani</HI> (for so they terme us)
so tis rashnesse to proclaime
ones opinion, weakenesse to
disclose it: This may gaine the
Odium of the Better, this the
injuries of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>A novice of late so soone as
he was come to <HI>Florence,</HI> said,
<HI>Methinks this place is somewhat
popishly affected.</HI></P>
<P>Another with more pardo∣nable
ignorance when his Host
askt him whether he was walk∣ing
in the Afternoone, replyd,
to Masse.</P>
<P>One of my Cotemporaries
discoursing with a Fryar, in a
Complemēt protested he did re∣verence
Clergy men <HI>for that he
was the sonne of a Priest in Eng∣land:</HI>
which the Monke could
not conster but either an <HI>Irony</HI>
to his Order, or Infamous to the
<PB REF="14"/>
Gentlemans owne descent.</P>
<P>The most cautious tongue is
incident to these Errours; yet
that nation is not so scrupulous
as to take notice of a strangers
words or actions unlesse openly
scandalous; for as <HI>Heretico</HI> is a
name utterly detestable, so
<HI>Tramontano</HI> by the Multitude is
held contemptible, which low
reputation begets a happy
privacy to the Reserv'd For∣reigner.</P>
<P>That sort of People which
Travellers have most agitation
with as <HI>Vetturino's</HI> Hosts &amp; the
like, are very peremptory and
crosse, which if you menace
they wil repaire with double in∣solence;
knowing that if in the
contest their <HI>Stilletto</HI> should do
mischiefe, the next Church may
be their Asylum, where no Law
or violence can attempt them.</P>
<P><PB REF="14"/>
The safest way is Dissimula∣tion,
and to winne better Ac∣commodation
amongst them
disparage not, rather commend
the worst.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Osterias</HI> or Innes stand
usually alone, remote from any
Village, so that Passengers must
bee content with what those
<HI>Tabernae</HI> can afford, and he that
seemes to dislike their feeble
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A weak Broath of Hearbs</NOTE> <HI>Minestra</HI> perhaps shall have
nothing but an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Good words.</NOTE> <HI>Allegramente</HI>
for amends.</P>
<P>This Inference I lay hold on
to speake more amply of the <HI>I∣talian.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Rome</HI> wore the Impe∣riall
Diadem of the subdued
World, it might have been a di∣sputable
Criticisme, whither
<HI>Rome</HI> stood in <HI>Italy;</HI> or <HI>Italy</HI> in
<HI>Rome,</HI> That voice of fame
which attributed all to the <HI>Ro∣man;</HI>
<PB REF="15"/>
derogated from the Re∣nowne
of the <HI>Italian:</HI> Now,
since <HI>Rome</HI> did resigne the
Crowne to the Miter; <HI>Italy</HI> al∣lowes
her no Supremacy, but
Ecclesiasticall; and in the gene∣rall
voge tis the most proper
phrase to say such a man is an
Italian, though a Native of
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>However, in the Survey of
this present Generation I finde a
residue of the old Genius still
surviving.</P>
<P>That Roman Generosity yet
runnes in the bloud of their No¦ble
Families, which (I have
heard) can draw their Pedigree
from the great Masters of the
World; as that of the <HI>Savelli</HI>
from <HI>Scipio Africanus.</HI></P>
<P>Neither doth the height of
their spirits argue lesse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Neopolitan</HI> is so elevated
<PB REF="15"/>
with his imaginary Reven¦newes that in his deepest po∣verty
hee will speake thou∣sands
rather then betray his
wants.</P>
<P>One will sit gravely before
his doore picking his teeth, and
condemne the Capon hee eate
last; when a morsell of Bread
would passe downe merri∣ly.</P>
<P>Another I have seen begging
in this method: first he lookes
about to see whether the Coast
be cleare, before hee will utter
one suppliant word; then hee
approaches in a more submisse
straine, yet if any one chance
to cast an eye that way; he re∣treates
to familiarity; Pressing
the justnesse of his Demands
till hee obtaines the almes;
which if but a penny or so, hee
casts it contemptibly in the Do∣nours
<PB REF="16"/>
face, but soone after
peaceably searches for the mo∣ney,
and when tis found prayes
for the Benefactour.</P>
<P>This is consonant with the
<HI>Spaniard,</HI> so is the <HI>Genuesian</HI> as
lofty as his buildings, so proud
in his Garbe, that at our first
nights Supper in <HI>Genua,</HI> some
Fidlars came to welcome us
with their Musick, but with so
grave and stately a Preamble,
that wee all withdrew from
our seats to salute the men, ima∣gining
them no lesse then Ma∣gistrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeians</HI> or Commo∣nalty
of <HI>Italy</HI> savour much of
the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandalls;</HI> yet e∣ven
these are frequently distin∣guisht
with the worthy Appel∣lations
of <HI>Julio, Flaminio, Fa∣bio,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Campagna di Roma</HI> I
<PB REF="16"/>
once espyde a Labourer tilling
the ground neer some decayed
Monuments; whereupon I
made towards the fellow and
askt him what those Ruines
were; Hee answered mee, hee
knew nothing; but he had often
heard his Grandfather tell a
Story of one <HI>Signor Romolo,</HI>
that fought there. A twinck∣ling
Tradition and implies
much.</P>
<P>They have a Recreation cer∣tainly
deriv'd from their An∣cestours,
<HI>viz: La Mora,</HI> anci∣ently
<HI>micare Digitis,</HI> at the first
it appeares but childishly ridi∣culous;
after better acquain∣tance,
a kinde of Conjuration;
Tis of force to binde the Fan∣cy;
yet the most illiterate are
best at the Game.</P>
<P>And no wonder since this
Ayre hath from all Ages che∣cherisht
<PB REF="17"/>
the strongest <HI>Atlase's</HI>
for Invention and Art.</P>
<P>What Braine but <HI>Italian</HI>
could contrive Engines to raise
so vast a Moles as the <HI>Vatican
Obelisque.</HI></P>
<P>Observe what machivillian
unheard of Weapons they de∣vise
to surprize an enemy un∣awares.</P>
<P>At <HI>Venice</HI> I saw a pocket
Church Booke with a Pistoll
hid in the binding, which turn∣ing
to such a Page, discharges.
A plot (I conceive) to entrap
him you hate, whilst yon are at
your devotions together, when
there's least suspition.</P>
<P>Another as rare, is a Pocket
stone-Bow, which held under
a Cloake shoots needles with
violence to pierce a mans body,
yet leaves a wound scarce dis∣cernable.</P>
<P><PB REF="17"/>
A third is a walking staffe
in appearance; at the top is a
Spring which graspt hard, at
the other end will jet forth a
Rapier with force enough to
kill at a yards distance.</P>
<P>A fourth is a Gunne to bee
charg'd with winde, which for
six paces will not faile of exe∣cution
with a small or no re∣port.</P>
<P>To these I may adde their
curious (yet Illegall) tricks
in poyson, some mortall by
smelling to, others that given
now, shall have no operation
till many moneths after.</P>
<P>Some will attempt to poy∣son
Rivers if they can but finde
the Source or Fountaine; and
in <HI>Milan</HI> there stands a Pillar
cald <HI>Colonna Infame,</HI> rais'd
where a Magicians house was
puld downe, who for a time
<PB REF="18"/>
poysond the whole City.</P>
<P>I omit not their excellency in
Statuary, Limming, Archite∣cture,
Gardning, Sceanes, Mu∣sick,
in which all <HI>Europe</HI> gives
them the precedency.</P>
<P>In what perfection they have
these faculties you may con∣clude
from these Instances.</P>
<P>Upon a Sepulcher in S. <HI>Peters</HI> at
<HI>Rome,</HI> in a <HI>Combent</HI> posture lie
the feminine Statues of <HI>Old age,</HI>
and of <HI>Youth;</HI> In the latter the
Sculpturer hath so exceeded
Nature, for Limbes, Features
and Comelinesse, that tis said
a <HI>Spaniard</HI> at his Beads left his
Devotions to expiate his sense
on that <HI>Niobe</HI>-like Lady, and
for that reason a vaile of black
Marble now covers Youths na∣kednesse;
whilst her neigh∣bour
old Age wants a Smock.</P>
<P>For limming, one <HI>Mattia
<PB REF="18"/>
Casale</HI> of <HI>Sienna</HI> (though no
eminent Artist) drew the Pi∣cture
of a Prince so exactly, and
with that vivacity, that in the

<P>Sir <HI>Henry Wotton</HI> a friend
to Ingenuity, and a great ad∣mirer
of it in the <HI>Italian,</HI> had
transported out of <HI>Italy</HI> a
Piece of two Dogs combat∣ing

there's a Walke for a hun∣dred

<P>Their Sceanes, (or as they

<P>Most of those places celebra∣ted

in lieu of those, others are so

<P>They have few trees but
what wee have seene in these
parts.</P>
<P>The Hesperian Apple, or
Orange Tree is of a most ravi∣shing
beauty perpetually Ver∣dant,
bearing an Hortyard of
Blossoms, greene and ripe
Fruite altogether.</P>
<P>Amongst their Medicinall
Plants scarce knowne amongst
us but in Apothicaries shoppes;
I tooke notice of one Odorife∣rous
Hearbe called <HI>Basilico,</HI>
which hath this innate power,
that if laid under a stone in
some moyst place, in two dayes
it produceth a Scorpion, this I
<PB REF="22"/>
can assert by experience, and to
countenance this story, there
fell out a strange accident in my
stay at <HI>Siena.</HI> A Gentleman was
so pleas'd with the smell of this
<HI>Basilico,</HI> that he had some dry'd
and beaten into powder, which
he snuft up, imagining it of the
same force with Tobacco to
cleare the head, but hee bought
the experience at the price of
his life, for hee dyed distracted;
His skull being afterwards ope∣ned
by the Chyrurgion, a nest
of Scorpions were found fee∣ding
on his Braine.</P>
<P>For their creatures they have
many not known to this Island,
but for curiosity. About
<HI>Rome</HI> they plow the land with
Buffolos; neere <HI>Sienna</HI> they
hunt the wild Boare, with the
Rowbuck, the Wolfe, the Por∣cupine,
and the <HI>Tasso Cane</HI> or
Mountaine Dog.</P>
<P><PB REF="22"/>
They have many <HI>Reptilias,</HI>
of strange natures.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cimici</HI> are most Trou∣blesome
bed fellowes; but Fleas
in <HI>Folio,</HI> yet so dainty, as they
will chuse their flesh; my
Chamberfellowes face hath
lookt bigge as <HI>Boreas</HI> with them
in one night, when they have
not so much as toucht my skin,
or disturbd my sleepe. They
are very offensive to his no∣strills

<P>The <HI>Cantherides</HI> are greene
flyes by day, and in the night
passe about the fields (a plea∣sing
spectacle) like flying
Glowormes with fire in their
Tayles.</P>
<P>A <HI>Rimarra</HI> is a Philanthro∣pall
creature in forme like a
Lyzzard, in bignesse much ex∣ceeding
it. A Countryman told
mee nature had so provided
<PB REF="23"/>
that the property of that beast
was thus; If a Peasent lay to
repose himselfe in the shade,
The <HI>Rimarra</HI> will vigilantly
attend him, if a Serpent ap∣proach
(with which she is at
enmity) shee tickles the Coun∣tryman
in the eare; summo∣ning
him to stand on his
guard.</P>
<P>No lesse strange though true
is the report of the <HI>Tarantula</HI>
which some say is a Flye; but
at the opening of a doore in the

not much unlike an Eft,
onely with longer clawes, at

our company cryd out <HI>Vna Ta∣rantula

of the <HI>Tarantula</HI> is of

falls a caparing; and nothing

<HEAD>AN
ITENIRARY
CONTAINING
A breife Narration of a
Voyage made through <HI>Italy,</HI> in
the yeare 1646. and 1647.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here are but two ordi∣nary
passages out of
<HI>France</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> the
one over the <HI>Alpes,</HI> the other by
the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> those
commonly which goe by the
first, returne by the second, and
so contrary. We <HI>(November</HI> be∣ing
quite expired ere we left
<HI>France)</HI> for our owne conveni∣ence
preferred a boate before
<PB N="2" REF="25"/>
a horse, I meane the Sea voy∣age,
before the Land. Where∣fore
being come to <HI>Antibe</HI> the
utmost City of <HI>France,</HI> wee
found favour of the Governour
(it being a Frontiere and place
of strength) in giving us a Bill
of health, without which it is
very difficult to enter into any
of the Italian States or Cities, &amp;
having over night procured a
Filoaco to carry us all our way
to <HI>Genua</HI> if so be wee mett with
no Boate of returne betwixt
thence and <HI>Monaco;</HI> the next
morning we departed, and a∣bout
nine in the forenoone
came before <HI>Nice</HI> in <HI>Savoy,</HI> situ∣ated
on the Sea side, but hath
no Port, the buildings are after
the Italian, &amp; it is commanded
by a strong Castle that stands
on a hill. Finding no conveni∣ence
of imbarquing better here
<PB N="3" REF="25"/>
we sayled on, but at the point
of Land that turnes towards
<HI>Morgues,</HI> there arose a contrary
winde, which forc't us to re∣tyre
into the next harbour, to
wit <HI>Villa Franca</HI> (aunciently
called <HI>Portus Herculis)</HI> where
by permissiō of the Governour
of the Citadell we lay that
night. This place likewise be∣longs
to the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> The
next day going out of the Ha∣ven
we met with a <HI>Genova Fi∣louco,</HI>
&amp; having agreed for our
passage in that, quitted our for∣mer,
yet no sooner were we in
the boat but a Tempest drove
us againe into the harbour; so
that we lost that day entirely.
The day following we had both
faire weather, &amp; a calme Sea,
which encourag'd our water∣men
to adventure out; about 2.
miles from <HI>Ʋilla Franca</HI> we dis-
<PB N="4" REF="26"/>
a great vessell making towards
us, which our Boatmen seemed
to feare taking it, for a Turkish
man of War, but we were after∣wards
informed to the cōtrary.
A little further we strooke into
the Port of <HI>Monaco,</HI> and after
an houre or two stay there, the
wind growing contrary, our
Boatmen wisht us to tarry lon∣ger
least wee should be exposed
to a greater inconvenience,
which wee the more willingly
condiscended too, in regard, tis
so remarkable a place as no
stranger can well passe without
especiall observation thereof;
for I must confesse I know no
so small a principality of the
like consideration, either for
strength or riches; The Prince
of the family of the <HI>Grimaldi</HI>
of <HI>Genua,</HI> is in his state sove∣raine,
and coynes mony, but
<PB N="5" REF="26"/>
hath still some greater King for
his Protector, of late yeares hee
left the Spanish party, and gave
himselfe with this his cheife
Towne, to the King of <HI>France's</HI>
tuition, so that at our arrive
there, there was a strict garison
of <HI>French;</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Cor∣bon</HI>
being then Governour to
whom wee had addresse from
his Brother in Law at <HI>Antibe,</HI>
us'd us very civilly, and sent a
souldier with us; to shew us all
the rarityes that are there to
be seene.</P>
<P><HI>Monaco</HI> (whether I may pro∣perly
call it a Town or Castle I
know not) is situated on the top
of a rockey Promontory of in∣credible
hard accesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monaco.</NOTE> inviron'd
with strong walls, within which
are some streets very neately
representing the face of a
City, in the middest is a spaci∣ous
<PB N="6" REF="27"/>
court fit for to exercise mi∣litary
discipline in, at the end
is the Princes Palace, which
though Beautifull on the out∣side
yet contains greater wealth
within, cheifly in his Gardrobe,
where the variety of Tapistries
the great quantity of plate, with
the vastnesse of vessels, as
Fountaines, Tables, and such
like of pure silver, striks a∣mazement
into him that sees it,
besides this rich furniture, there
are two Cabinets or Galeries of
rare curiosities which excep∣ting
the Duke of <HI>Florences,</HI>
may be equaled with most of
that nature in <HI>Italy:</HI> amongst
other singularities I was much
taken with the statue of an In∣dian
of Porphyre, and other
materiall, as likewise a gem∣mery
compil'd of severall pre∣tious
stones with these letters;
<PB N="7" REF="27"/>
<HI>Otium Francisci Bembi;</HI> The
Prince was then in enlarging
this Palace, and beautifying it
with Marbles and waterworks.
Having with great satisfaction
seene all the particularities of
this place, we returned downe
to our Inne, and it growing to∣wards
night, some few howers
before our departure a hard ac∣cident
befell us, which was the
losse of our Bill of health,
wherefore though it was darke
and the watch was set, yet wee
sent up a letter by a string to
the Governour, who very
courteously returned us a
Ticket of larger extent then
our former. At midnight wee
departed from <HI>Monaco</HI> past
eight miles farther by <HI>Menton,</HI>
a village belonging to the same
Prince, and about breake of
day we came before <HI>Vintimiglia</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="28"/>
the first city (towards <HI>France)</HI>
of the Republique of <HI>Genua,</HI>
from hence we were in view of
the mountaines of <HI>Corsica</HI> and
foure miles farther we past by
Saint <HI>Remes,</HI> where the shore
(which is called by the name
of the rive of <HI>Genua)</HI> is all cove∣red
with Orange, Citron, and
Date Trees. Past the rest of
that day without seeing any
thing remarkable, unlesse <HI>Porto
Mauritio,</HI> where heretofore
there was a very good Port
which the Genuesians ruin'd,
fearing it should bring preju∣dice
to their owne. Towards
night we strooke in at <HI>Oneille,</HI>
a city which seemes to inter∣rupt
the Genois dominions,
and belongs to the Duke of
<HI>Savoy.</HI> After we had supt wee
tooke boate and sayled all
night by many Townes, <HI>viz.
<PB N="9" REF="28"/>
Diano, Araisse,</HI> where they fish
for Corall, <HI>Albengue, Luan,</HI> a
city of the Prince of <HI>Oria</HI> a Ge∣nois,
<HI>Final</HI> a place of strength
and the only garrison the King
of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath in these coasts;
the Port though small yet
serves much in the conveyance
of men and amunition towards
<HI>Milan.</HI> This place commonly
pillageth strangers, they taking
all for Frenchmen; but (pray∣sed
be God) wee past quietly,
and towards breake of day
came before <HI>Savona;</HI> The most
ancient and greatest city of the
<HI>Genevoisat</HI> after <HI>Genua</HI> it selfe.
Behind this city, the <HI>Apennines</HI>
that cleave <HI>Italy</HI> in sunder be∣gin
to take their rise. From
hence to <HI>Genua</HI> is 35. Italian
miles; all which way one goes
more and more into the plea∣santnesse
of Italy, the whole
<PB N="10" REF="29"/>
board being fild with Country
Seats and Villages, which for
beauty surpasse many cities I
have seene elsewhere. Amongst
those <HI>San Pietro d' Arania</HI> (whi∣ther
the richer Genuesians re∣tire
themselves in the sommer,
and indeed may bee call'd ano∣ther
<HI>Genua</HI> for the gallantry of
the buildings) is the best; but
three miles distant from <HI>Genua,</HI>
the Metropolis of that most
flourishing Republick, which
contains so stately Palaces, that
from all the rest of Italy, it hath
gotten the name of <HI>Genua</HI> the
superbe.</P>
<P>Tis situated at the foot of
very high mountaines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genua.</NOTE> which
though sterile, yet want no∣thing
that Art can enrich
them with; In gardens, water∣workes,
and the like. That
which exceeds all the rest, is
<PB N="11" REF="29"/>
the Prince of <HI>Orias</HI> Palace, rea∣ching
from the bottome of the
shoare, to the top of the moun∣taines,
divided into three gar∣dens.
In the first whereof the
Terrasses or Porches one a∣bove
another bore up with
marble Pillars, is very magni∣ficent,
as likewise the Foun∣taine
of the Eagles, and the
Family of <HI>Neptune:</HI> at the one
side that famous Cage of iron∣worke,
which is of so vast an
extent that it encloseth a wood
of Cypresse and other trees.
The other two are fild with
Grottes, Orange trees; and o∣ther
variety of delights: At the
upper part of all stands the sta∣tue
of <HI>Jupiter</HI> tonant. Within
the Pallace the Gardrobe full
of rarietyes; the Tapestries and
precious Furuiture declare
greatly the richnesse of that
Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="30"/>
Next to this is the house of
<HI>Hieronimo del Negro,</HI> where the
excellent Pictures, the fall of
waters, the Fountain, the Pis∣cina,
the Grove and other de∣lightfull
departments, are well
worth seeing. On all sides of the
City is an infinity of such places
of pleasure, especially round a∣bout
the Port, which is of a
large circuit, resembling much
the forme of a Theatre en∣clos'd
with faire buildings.
Tis defended by a solid Bul∣warke
(which they call <HI>Il
Mole)</HI> that lyes about 2 hun∣dred
paces into the Sea, rais'd
at a very great expence: Op∣posite
to that a rocky Pro∣montory
casts it selfe forth, at
the head whereof stands a ve∣ry
lofty Pharos, bearing a lan∣terne
of more then an ordina∣ry
bignesse, to guide Ships in
<PB N="13" REF="30"/>
the night: Within the Haven
is a place where the Gallyes
lay, every one in a particular
Classis. As for the City it selfe,
it is enough to say the Genu∣esians
live in a Kingly luxu∣ry,
and I believe it is the best
built and compacted City, not
onely of <HI>Italy,</HI> but also of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
The houses generally
are very high, the streets
for the most part (its onely
fault) are somewhat narow,
so that no Coaches are here
admitted, which though an
inconvenience, yet preserves
the wayes more cleane and
neater. I except here that spa∣cious,
long, even, and indeed
Mistris of streets the <HI>Strada
Nova,</HI> which I am confident
may be justly preferd before
any in Christendome, so proud
in Architecture, so rich in Mar∣bles
<PB N="14" REF="31"/>
are the Palaces tis fild
with. The fairest one belongs
to the Duke of <HI>Oria.</HI> Amongst
the publick Edifices, the Ex∣change
or Merchants Hall.
the Dukes Palace with the Ar∣mory
for 30 thousand men de∣serv'd
our walking to. Neither
are the Genuesians lesse splen∣did,
in adorning their Conse∣crated
places; witnesse the
mighty quantity of polish't
Marble, wherewith all the
Churches are fild, especially
<HI>San Lorenzo</HI> the Dome, and
<HI>Santo Ambrosio</HI> belonging to
the Jesuites. But that which
surpasseth all, and is of most
admiration, is the Chappell of
the <HI>Anunciade,</HI> begun to bee
built not many yeares since at
the expence of one Family,
(whose Palace joynes to it)
yet is of so incredible richnesse
<PB N="15" REF="31"/>
for the red and white Marble
Pillars, and other ornaments,
that one would imagine the
revenues of a whole City could
not bee enough to raise so glo∣rious
a Worke as that will be
when tis finisht. Finally, the
Genuesians to defend this their
brave City, have encompast it
with Walls no lesse commen∣dable
for beauty and strength,
then prodigious for their large
extent. The people of this
Common-wealth are habited
all alike, somewhat tending to∣wards
the Spanish Mode; and
are of a very austere and su∣perbe
humour, hardly vouch∣safing
to look so low as a stran∣ger,
wherefore having with
much satisfaction seene their
Flourishing Estate, wee left
them. We set out from <HI>Ge∣nua</HI>
in a Filouca about Sun-set∣ting,
<PB N="16" REF="32"/>
and having sayld all that
night, about noone the next
day we strooke into <HI>Porto Ve∣nere,</HI>
and after dinner crost the
<HI>Golfe of Aspecia,</HI> (which is de∣fended
with many strong For∣tifications)
to <HI>Lerizi.</HI> This
Bourg being the mid way from
<HI>Genua</HI> to <HI>Ligourne</HI> (such is the
villany of the watermen in
these parts) if they get their
passengers, chiefly strangers hi∣ther,
they will so delay their
departure, pretending the in∣conveniences
of the weather,
that by lying still at so great an
expence, they may bee forc'd
to give them their pay, and
to hire horses for the rest of
the way by Land. Which trick
wee were forc't to suffer pati∣ently,
after a day and halfes at∣tendance
for our boat. Hence
we tooke Post, and having past
<PB N="17" REF="32"/>
through the Olive woods, over
the hills that lay neerest the
shoare, wee came into a low
plaine Countrey, which con∣tinued
so to <HI>Ligorne.</HI> First we
past the River <HI>Magre,</HI> then
went by <HI>Sarazana,</HI> a good City,
and last of the dominion of
<HI>Genua,</HI> after that we came into
the Principality of <HI>Massa,</HI> wher∣in
we past by <HI>Lavenza</HI> and <HI>Car∣rara,</HI>
where out of the hills
they dig great store of Marble,
and then through <HI>Massa</HI> it selfe,
where the Prince resides in E∣state
Soveraigne.</P>
<P>The Towne is very plea∣sant,
standing in a Territorie
fruitfull in Orange trees and
other fruits. Hence wee came
suddenly into <HI>Tuscany,</HI> but
quickly left it, falling into a
woody Country, belonging to
the State of <HI>Lucas,</HI> and so
<PB N="18" REF="33"/>
to <HI>Viregio,</HI> under the same
power, standing at the mouth
of a small river, which runnes
from <HI>Lucques.</HI> Here we were
forc't to lye, and the next morn∣ing
some two mile farther wee
past the river that parts the Re∣publique
of <HI>Lucques</HI> from <HI>Tos∣cany,</HI>
and so in the morning ar∣riv'd
at <HI>Pisa.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pisa.</NOTE></P>
<P>Which City was hereto∣fore
a great free state of it
selfe, but at the rising of the fa∣mily
of the <HI>Medicis</HI> on which
line the Dukes of <HI>Etruria</HI> suc∣cessively
runne, this with many
other noble cities, was reduced
to the great Dukes subjection.
From whom it hath received
many Embellisments. Tis situ∣ated
in a Marshy land, so that
the unholesomnesse of the aire
renders it scarce of the native
people, much more of stran∣gers
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
which seldome tarry any
longer then to see the rarities of
the place. Amongst which I
preferre that worthy peece of
arte the Falling Tower which
travellers boast of, (and not un∣deservedly)
as one of the most
mervellous things they see in
the voyage of <HI>Italy.</HI> Tis cover'd
round with galleries &amp; 7. rowes
one above another of Marble
Pillars, so that 'tis hard to bee
imagin'd by what engines so
great a structure should be sup∣ported,
it being built so decli∣ning
to one side, that all men
which regard it, at the first ex∣pect
its fall. Hard by is the <HI>Do∣me</HI>
or Cathedrall Church of <HI>Pi∣sa;</HI>
where threescore Pillars
testifie as well its Antiquity,
as the Gates of Brasse its rarity.
Joyning to this is the <HI>Campo
Santo,</HI> or <HI>Cimetiere</HI> firm'd in
<PB N="20" REF="34"/>
with a wall of Marble, and
much resembles a Cloyster; in
the midst is the Church yard
from whence the place hath its
denomination, that implies the
holy Field; because halfe the
ground was brought from <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI>
and it hath a particu∣lar
propriety, that all bodies
which are buried there, are
consum'd within the space of
40. houres. Here are likewise
reserv'd many Ancient Urnes,
which, with the story of the
Old and New Testament pain∣ted
of old worke, make the
place very venerable. Hard by
is the Baptistary, or <HI>San Gio∣vanni;</HI>
wherein, the Font,
and pulpit leaning on foure
Lyons, will for the precious∣nesse
of the stone, yield to no
other in <HI>Italie.</HI> Leaving the
<HI>Area</HI> where these things stand
<PB N="21" REF="34"/>
together, a little more into the
towne is the Chappell and Pa∣lace,
of the Knights of the Or∣der
of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI> the Fron∣tespiece
of the Chappell is of
Marble neatly pollish't. The
inside is adorn'd with the truest
Ensignes of Valour; I meane
Trophees taken from the com∣mon
enemies of Christianity,
the Turkes. Before their Pa∣lace
is the statue of the great
Duke <HI>Cosmus,</HI> with a Fountain.
This Dignity of Knighthood
is much like to that of <HI>Malta,</HI>
both to maintain Christs cause
against the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> yet
these may marrie, the others
I conceive may not: These
weare a red Crosse for their
badge in this fashion. ✚ From
hence we walk't to the Physiti∣ans
garden, which is more for
use then delight; although there
<PB N="22" REF="35"/>
be good walks, &amp; water-works
that well washt us, yet for the
most 'tis cover'd with simples,
outlandish Plants and the like.
Joyning to it is a gallery very
commodious for Medecinall
things, it abounding with all
curiosities of Nature, as for∣reign
creatures, Stones, Mine∣ralls,
and whatsoever strange
the farthest Indies produce. In
generall, this City stands so op∣portunely,
as few like for the
receiving of all forreign Wares.
In the midst thereof runnes the
river <HI>Arno,</HI> from thence to its
Embuschment navigable for
very great Vessels, so that here
is a place where the Duke
builds his Gallies: On one side
of the river, is a faire street cald
<HI>Longarno,</HI> where is the great
Dukes Palace, and before it the
statue of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the third;
<PB N="23" REF="35"/>
On the other side is the Ex∣change,
little, but of Marble,
then which nothing more
common in <HI>Italy.</HI> In a word,
'tis prayse enough, to say tis
the third City under the great
Duke, who I thinke hath the
fairest of what Prince soever.
Having taken a satisfactory
view hereof, we went on our
way to <HI>Ligourne,</HI> whither there
is an hourely convenience of a
Coach to transport Merchan∣dise
from <HI>Ligorne</HI> to <HI>Pisa,</HI> the
Duke hath made an artificiall
Channell, of 15. miles long,
which bares small boates like
to Venetian <HI>Gondoloes.</HI> The
Escluse of which Channell we
saw at our setting forth out of
<HI>Pisa,</HI> cover'd for 250. paces.
The most part of the way to
<HI>Ligorne</HI> is through Fennes, till
one enters into the great Dukes
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>
Forrest, which continues to the
towne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ligorne.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Ligorne</HI> the only maritimate
place of importance, under the
Great Duke, is situated in a
plaine, at the board of the <HI>Me∣diterranean
Sea,</HI> tis but little,
yet the great concurse of Mer∣chants
which flow thither from
all Nations, chiefly from my
one, make it more spoken of
than many Cities, of a larger
extent. 'Tis an innumerable
summe of money the Duke re∣ceives
yearly from this small
Port: wherefore his Predeces∣sors
with him have omitted no∣thing
to make it strong, wit∣nesse
the royall Bastions, and
mote wherewith tis fenct; The
great Port where the Ships lay
at Anchor, is defended by the
Mole, and about hath many
fanalls. The <HI>Darcina,</HI> where
<PB N="25" REF="36"/>
the Gallies (then but six in
number) lay as quiet as in a
Chamber, is most exquisitely
well contriv'd: Before stands
that best of moderne Statues,
the Duke <HI>Ferdinand</HI> in Marble,
and the <HI>Colosses</HI> of foure slaves
under him, in brasse in divers
Postures, so lively represented,
that if the Statuary could have
fram'd a voice as well as those
bodies, he might have con∣querd
nature. Besides this
piece, there are no more curio∣sities
in this towne, yet many
conveniences. The streets are
generally large, the houses low,
but uniforme, unlesse some
which have been put out of or∣der
by an Earthquake, to
which this place is often Sub∣ject.
The great place is very
beautifull, and fit for the as∣semblies
of Merchants. On the
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
houses round about and in the
fairest streets, are pictur'd all the
battels, and victories of the
great Dukes gallies, obtained
over the <HI>Turks,</HI> which a slave
did to gaine his redemption.
The <HI>Jewes</HI> which are here in
great number, have the fairest
Synagogue I ever yet saw,
wherin on a saturday their Sab∣baoth,
we saw the manner of
their divine (if so I may call it)
service. Their priviledges here
are more then ordinary, they
wearing no marke of distincti∣on
as in other Townes, so that
here the wealthier and richer
sort are of that Sect. The
<HI>Greeks</HI> likewise have a Congre∣gation,
and Church here. In
a word, <HI>Ligorne</HI> is compacted
of forreigners, yet the un∣wholsomenesse
of the aire ba∣nisheth
a great part from
<PB N="27" REF="37"/>
thence, which I by dangerous
experience found true; for the
day before I was to depart
for <HI>Florence,</HI> (having all the
while I stayed at <HI>Ligorne</HI> found
a strange alteration of the aire,
different both from that of
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>France.)</HI> I was ill
dispos'd to sicknesse, however,
not so much but that I adven∣tur'd
on my journey, which
though with much difficulty I
perfected. The first night we lay
at <HI>Pisa,</HI> which way we had for∣merly
past. The next morning
we tooke Coach, (a very un∣pleasant
passage over hilly
way) and past first by <HI>S. Ro∣man,</HI>
a Convent of the Obser∣vantins
standing on high, from
whence is a pleasant prospect
downe the valley, from thence
we came to <HI>Empoly,</HI> a neat lit∣tle
towne where we lay, and
<PB N="28" REF="38"/>
the next day towards noone
arrived at <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>Which for its singular ex∣cellencies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Florence.</NOTE>
amongst all other
Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> is cal'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
the Faire. <HI>Florence</HI> the Capi∣tall
of <HI>Toscany,</HI> and seat of the
great Duke, is scituated at the
bottome of very high hills, en∣viron'd
on all sides with the
same, excepting towards the
West side, before which lies a
plaine Countrey, <HI>vulgo Pianu∣ra
di Fiorenza.</HI> This City is di∣vided
in two by the river <HI>Arno,</HI>
over which are built foure
Bridges of stone, upon one of
the two chief is the Goldsmiths
street; upon the other of ve∣ry
stately structure stand the
foure quarters of the yeare in
marble; Opposite to this be∣fore
the Trinity, stands a vast
Columne, with a statue of Ju∣stice
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
in Porphyre at the top,
which, <HI>Cosmus</HI> the first great
Duke rais'd as a Trophee in
that place, because the newes
there came to his eare of the
taking of <HI>Siena.</HI> Hard by, is the
<HI>Palazzo de Strozzi,</HI> no lesse to
be admir'd for the immensity
of its fabrick, then for its rude
and unusuall Architecture.
From hence towards the right
hand is the Merchants Vault,
supported with faire Pillars,
and before it a brazen Boare
jetting forth water; Keeping
right on, one comes into the
great Place, in the midst there∣of
is the great Duke <HI>Cosmus,</HI> a
horse-back in brasse, with this
inscription under.</P>

<P>Betwixt this horse and the
<HI>Palazzo vecchio,</HI> is a Fountaine,
which all <HI>Italy</HI> cannot shew
the like besides, round about
the Laver is the family of <HI>Nep∣tune</HI>
in brasse, with his Co∣losse
of Marble in the midst,
bore up by foure horses; The
whole not possible to be equald,
much lesse excel'd by humaine
art.</P>
<P>In this same <HI>Piazza,</HI> is a
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
Porch archt and adorn'd with
some statues, amongst which
that of <HI>Judith,</HI> in brasse with
that of the Rape of the <HI>Sabines,</HI>
three Persons in severall Po∣stures
cut all out of one stone
are most remarkable.</P>
<P>Just against it is the <HI>Palazzo
Vecchio,</HI> at the entrance stands
two Colosses, the one of <HI>Da∣vid,</HI>
the other of <HI>Hercules</HI>
trampling on <HI>Cacus,</HI> the first
of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> which in
my judgement comes short of
the other, though he the more
famous statuary. Within is a
Court set about with Pillars of
<HI>Corinthian</HI> worke; Above is a
very spacious Hall with divers
Statues, and amongst them
those of two Popes, <HI>Leo</HI> the
tenth, and <HI>Clement</HI> the seventh,
of the family of the <HI>Medicis;</HI>
the apertenants of this lodging
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
are very great, and costly, but
it being not so frequented as if
the Court were kept there, e∣very
thing looseth its luster.</P>
<P>Wherefore having speedily
dispatcht the sight hereof; that
which requires a week to ob∣serve
well, is at hand: I meane
that richest of Treasures, the
great Dukes Gallery. In the
lower story sit the Courts of
Justice, with an arcade to walk
in on each side. Above are the
shops of divers Artisans which
work continually for the great
Duke. In the uppermost part
is contained as many wonders
as things, Some to be admir'd
for their preciousnesse and art,
others for their rarity and An∣tiquity.
On each side of the
Gallerie are ranged Statues, to
the number of fourescore and
odde, of which for Antiquity
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
I preferre the Idoll brought
from the temple of <HI>Apollo, at
Delphis,</HI> with this verse on the
Pedistall.</P>
<Q>Ʋt potui huc veni Delphis &amp; fratre relicto.</Q>
<P>As likewise that of <HI>Scipio
Africanus,</HI> holding up his
Gowne under his arme, accor∣ding
to <HI>Ciceros</HI> words. <HI>Nobis
quidem olim annus erat unus ad
cohibendum brachium toga con∣stitutus,
&amp; ut exercitatione lu∣doque
campestri, tunicati utere∣mur.</HI>
After these I may reckon
the two triumphant Pillars;
from whence they were taken
I know not; but their worke
speaks them <HI>Roman.</HI> Over the
statues hang the Pictures, some
Prototypes of the most famous
men of the moderne times, on
the one side Schollars, on the
other souldiers.</P>
<P>At the right hand of this
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
gallerie are severall stanzas full
of curiosities, into which who∣soever
enters is astonisht at the
quantity of wealth; confus'd
with the variety of things
worth observation.</P>
<P>In the first Roome we went
into, stands the Tabernacle,
or altar destinated for <HI>S. Lau∣rence
Chappell,</HI> no part thereof
of common Marble; but total∣ly
compacted with Jewells and
Precious stones; The value
inestimable.</P>
<P>In the next Chamber is a Ta∣ble
with Flowers, and Birds in
their naturall colours of Pre∣cious
stones, with a Cabinet
priz'd at two hundred thou∣sand
Crownes, coverd with
Agaths, Emerauds, Anama∣thists,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Within is the pas∣sion
of our Saviour with the
twelve Apostles all in Amber.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41"/>
In the third is a Cabinet
with Calcidon Pillars, fild (as
they told us) with ancient
medailles of Gold; round a∣bout
this Roome is an infinite
number of Naturall and artifi∣ciall
curiosities, as the Nalle
turn'd halfe into Gold by Al∣chymy,
The Emperours head
on a Turqu'oise bigger then a
Walnut, with thousands more.
Next is the Armory, wherein
are the habits, and diverse sorts
of armes of severall ages, and
People; amonst those, the
King of <HI>China's</HI> habit, <HI>Hanni∣bals</HI>
Head-piece of <HI>Corinthian</HI>
metall, <HI>Charlemain's</HI> Sword;
and an argument of the <HI>Italian</HI>
Jealousie, an Invention to
lock up female frailty. Here
likewise is a Magnet which
beares up fourescore pound
weight of Iron.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="42"/>
In the last Cabinet we saw
the curious Turnity of Ivory,
a Pillar of Orientall Alablaster,
&amp;c. and from thence wee went
into the Gardrobe, where are
twelve great Cubbards of sil∣ver
Plate, a service all of pure
Massie Gold; A saddle which
the Emperour gave in a present
to the great Duke, all Embroy∣der'd
with Pearles and Dia∣monds;
These, with many other
Particularities of this gallerie,
(which might be a Theame
copious enough to write a Vo∣lume
on,) declaring the wealth
of this Prince equall with any
Kings in Christendome.</P>
<P>From the said gallery is a Cor∣rider;
or private passage to the
<HI>Palazzo de Pithi,</HI> on the other
side of the river; where the
Duke keeps his Court; The
Front of this edifice is very
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
majestique towards the Basis
of Dorick work, in the midst of
Ionick, in the uppermost sto∣ry
of <HI>Corinthian.</HI> In the Court
is a Grotte with statues and a
fountaine over it, yet that
which is most wonderfull is
the Loadstone of a most pro∣digious
greatnesse.</P>
<P>Neither are the gardens to
be omitted, which for their
largenesse have the face of a
Forrest, for their variety of
a Paradise. Here Cypres groves,
there Walkes with statues,
here a Sea of Fountaines, there
Swans, Austriches, and other
recreative Creatures.</P>
<P>Being now on this side of the
<HI>Arno,</HI> I will take notice of all I
saw there before I returne to
the other. And first there
stands a Pillar, bearing on it
the statue of <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> in
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
the same place where hee was
beheaded. Next on the wall
of <HI>S. Nicholas</HI> Church, above
a mans reach are these veses,
signifying an inundation of the
River.</P>
<Q><L>☞ Fluctibus undisonis similis pela∣gique
procellis.</L>
<L>Huc tumidis praeceps, irruit Arnus

Templa, Viros.</L>
<L>M DL. Id sept.</L></Q>
<P>Going now back into the
fuller body of the City, on the
other side of the River; on
the banck there is a Marble,
which I found of no great con∣sequence,
yet set by a <HI>Veneti∣an</HI>
Embassador as a Monument
to a horse there buried, which
had done him good service in
the siege of the City.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="43"/>
The Epitaph runs thus.</P>
<Q><L>Non ingratus Herus (sonipes</L>
<L>Memorande) sepulchrum</L>
<L>Hoc, tibi pro meritis, haec mo∣numenta
dedit.</L></Q>
<P>Least I should dwell too
long amongst these earthly de∣lights,
wherewith <HI>Florence</HI> is
fil'd, I will goe and meditate
in the Churches; and first in
the <HI>Dome,</HI> which I conceive
either for the exquisitenesse of
the worke, or worth of so vast
a Bulke of Red, Black, and
white Marble, to be the fairest
Cathedrall without, that ever
man laid eyes on. Its better
part is the <HI>Cupola,</HI> so high that
the brasse Globe at the top, is
capable of holding sixteen per∣sons.</P>
<P>No lesse wonderfull is the
Steeple, which without ex∣empt,
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
will yield to no other in
the world, composed of the
same stone and materialls with
the Church, but with more art
and ornaments.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Dome</HI> is the Tem∣ple
of <HI>Mars;</HI> built in an Octo∣gon;
now cald <HI>S. John,</HI> or
the Baptistary. The foure
gates of Brasse, vvhich <HI>Ortelius</HI>
prefers before any else in the
world, the broken Pillars of
<HI>Porphyre,</HI> the pavement, the
old <HI>Grecian</HI> Pieces at the top,
are things to be noted.</P>
<P>From hence wee went to
see that mirrour of Art, and
wonder of this present age,
<HI>Saint Laurents</HI> Chappell, which
is so glorious, that whosoever
enters, will even imagine him∣selfe
in some place above terre∣striall.
'Tis wholly overlaid
with fine Pollisht stones, nei∣ther
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
is any colour upon Earth,
but it is there in stones natural∣ly,
all which I have been since
told by diverse, (an argument
of the great riches included in
the Bowells of <HI>Italy)</HI> are dugg
up within the great Dukes do∣minions.
Round about this
Chappell are all the scutions of
the townes under the great
Duke, in their proper Colours
of stone. Above are Niches for
the statues of the great Dukes.
Beside them their Urnes. The
intent of this whole sumptious
Fabrick, being that it should
successively serve for the Se∣pulcher
of the great Dukes.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Laurents</HI> Church and
Convent joyne to this, where
the Library fild with Bookes,
all in Manuscripts is not con∣temptible.</P>
<P>Not farre from hence is <HI>San∣ta
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
Maria Novella;</HI> in the Court
are two Marble Pyramids that
stand on brasse Turtoises. Hard
by is <HI>S. Maries</HI> Church be∣longing
to the <HI>Jacobins,</HI> where
on the North wall is the
Tombe of <HI>Picus Mirandola,</HI>
an eminent schollar, with this
Epitaph.</P>
<Q><L>Joannes jacet hic Mirandola, cae∣tera
morunt.</L>
<L>Et Tagus è Ganges forsan &amp;
Antipodes.</L></Q>
<P>In the same Church is <HI>Poli∣tianus</HI>
his Tombe subscribed
thus.</P>
<Q><L>Politianus in hoc tumulo jacet
Angelus, unum</L>
<L>Qui caput, &amp; linguas, (res
nova) tres habuit.</L></Q>
<P>From hence I went to the
<HI>Anunciade,</HI> and saw in the way
the Fountaine of the <HI>Centaure.</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
The <HI>Anunciade</HI> is a place of
great devotion, to a <HI>Madonna</HI>
drawne by the hand of <HI>Saint
Luke.</HI> In the <HI>Piazza</HI> before is
the statue of the Duke <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI>
the first; on horseback in
brasse, made by the same hand,
with the former above mentio∣ned,
so that there is little diffe∣rence
betwixt them. Hard by
are kept the Lions, and other
wilde beasts; and a little far∣ther
the Menage or Stables of
the great Duke stord with <HI>Bar∣bary</HI>
and other excellent horses,
and as I remember, I never saw
better horse then at <HI>Florence.</HI>
On the wall of the <HI>Cavalrizza</HI>
is this Inscription.</P>
<P>Franciscus Medices, Magnus

<P>Next to these though much
distance, <HI>Santa Croce</HI> deserves
seeing. Before it is a faire spa∣tious
Court, in which (it being
<HI>Carnavall</HI> time while wee were
at <HI>Florence)</HI> we saw the play at
<HI>Calce,</HI> with <HI>Cavalcades,</HI> shewes,
and other assemblies of the No∣bility.</P>
<P>Within the Church is the
tombe of that famous Statuary,
Picturer, and Architecture,
<HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> made by his
owne hand; Over his Urne
stand those three arts, hee was
so renowned for with their
instruments broken, bewail∣ing
the losse of their Patron

underneath this Inscription.</P>

<P>To conclude my description
of <HI>Florence,</HI> the houses are
high built, the streets pav'd
with great stones, even and
long, many Fountaines, and o∣ther
publick ornaments, decla∣ring
the magnificence of the
great Dukes. For eight mile
round about the City there
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
seemes another <HI>Florence,</HI> so full
are the fields speckled with
Country seats. Neither are
those delights to private men a∣lone,
but there are likewise
publike walkes, witnesse that
of Pines two mile long: that
of <HI>Cypresses</HI> leading to <HI>Poggio
Imperiale,</HI> and many more.</P>
<P>Two miles up into the Nor∣therne
Mountaines lies the old
<HI>Fesuli,</HI> often spoke of amongst
the ancient Writers, but now
a poore Village, not having so
much as the remnants of An∣tiquity.</P>
<P>In fine, there is no Province
in <HI>Italy</HI> more furnish't with de∣lightfull,
and well peopled Ci∣ties;
then that of the great
Duke, whose Ancestours ha∣ving
united the States of three
Common-wealths together, to
wit, <HI>Of Pisa, Florence,</HI> and <HI>Sie∣na,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="47"/>
doth now entirely possesse
all <HI>Toscany;</HI> the nobler part of
<HI>Italy.</HI> The wife of this present
Great Duke, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the se∣cond
of that name, comes from
the Duke of <HI>Ʋrbin,</HI> of the fa∣mily
of <HI>Rovori.</HI></P>
<P>The Revenues of this Prince
of <HI>Toscany</HI> exceeed yearly ten
hundred thousand Crownes,
which will amount to a hun∣dred
thousand pound <HI>English,</HI>
his ordinary guard is of Caval∣ry,
and Infantry, with <HI>Ger∣mans</HI>
very well equipag'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Florentins</HI> have com∣monly
notable head pieces, so
that from hence spring notable
Polititians, and States-men
<HI>Machevil</HI> was of them, and 'tis
said that three Embassadours
from severall Kings, meeting
accidentally on the way, prov'd
in the conclusion to be all <HI>Flo∣rentins.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48"/>
So soone as we had fill'd our
selves with the sight of those
many singularities, that are in
and about <HI>Florence,</HI> wee set for∣ward
for <HI>Siena.</HI></P>
<P>Going out of <HI>Florence,</HI> at
the <HI>Porta Romana,</HI> one leaves
<HI>Poggio Imperiale a Villa</HI> of the
great Dukes, which I had o∣mitted
above. At the entrance
of the walkes of <HI>Cypres,</HI> that
leads to it are the statues of
the <HI>Tybre</HI> and <HI>Arno;</HI> those
of the famous old and new Po∣ets,
<HI>Virgil, Ovid, Petrarche,</HI>
and <HI>Dante.</HI> The house swarmes
with rarities, chiefly with ex∣cellent
Pictures, amongst them
all the line of <HI>Austria,</HI> this great
Dukes mother, who built this
house, being sister to the Empe∣rour.</P>
<P>After wee had past by that,
wee lay that night at a little
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
Bourg call'd <HI>Santo Cassiano.</HI>
The next morning wee rode
through a Village <HI>Barbarino,</HI>
from whence the mighty stir∣ring
family of the Cardinalls
tooke their originall. Wee
din'd at <HI>Poggio Bonci,</HI> a place
noted for the perfumd <HI>Tobacco</HI>
compos'd there; which the
<HI>Italians</HI> through custome take
in powder, as profusely, as we
in <HI>England</HI> doe in the pipe.
From hence in the afternoone
we arriv'd at <HI>Siena.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Siena</HI> formerly a free State
of it self, now subject to the
Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> stands aloft
covering the back of a hill; so
that in the hottest time of the
yeare, this City is still refresht
by coole gailes of winde; The
ayre is very wholsome, much
agreeing with the constitution

very curteous, a great deale
suiting to the humours of for∣reigners,
and besides the puri∣ty
of the <HI>Italian</HI> Language, is
here profest, and spoken; these
and the like conveniences make
it much frequented by Travel∣lers,
and indeed mov'd us to
settle our selves there, for some
Moneths.</P>
<P>Here wee stayd not to see the
rarities of the Place, which are
not many in number; but to
get some knowledge and pra∣ctise
in the Vulgar Tongue,
however <HI>Siena</HI> deserves a bet∣ter
description then my pen
can afford it; for neatnesse and
gentility, yielding to no other
in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>At the entrance of the <HI>Porta
Camulia,</HI> or <HI>di Fiorenza,</HI> onely
the higher buildings are in
view; but out of the <HI>Porta Ro∣mans,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
the City seemes to raise
it selfe with a great deale of
Majesty; chiefly because of the
many Towers it hath, which
during the time of its Liberty,
were rais'd in honour of such
and such men as had done any
worthy service for the Com∣mon-wealth,
amongst these
Towers which stand yet as
signes of its formerly possest
Freedome; that of <HI>Mangio</HI>
surpasseth for height, which
though its foundations be in
the Bottome of the <HI>Piazza,</HI> yet
outtops all the City besides, It
serves now for the Clock-house;
From above is a faire
prospect even to the confines
of <HI>Toscany,</HI> below at the foot
of this hidious Structure, is a
Chappell of Marble, where on
set dayes Masse is said to the
People in publick.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="50"/>
To this joynes the Senate
house, built by the <HI>Goths,</HI> as
some conceive by the manner
of the Architecture. At one
end thereof stands a Pillar,
bearing <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus</HI>
sucking the Wolfe, in brasse,
which are the Armes of <HI>Siena,</HI>
an infallible argument of its
Antiquity, and certainly di∣rived
from the <HI>Romans,</HI> of
whom this City was a Colony.
There are frequently more of
the like pillars about the Town
upon one more decayed, then
the rest is ingraved-<HI>Memores
Huberum,</HI> old, very old La∣tine.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Piazza,</HI> which lies
in the heart of the City, I can∣not
fancie a more pleasing or
commodious Place; tis of a
large Compasse, resembling
(whether naturally so, or ar∣tificially
<PB N="53" REF="50"/>
made so I know
not) the fashion of a <HI>Cockle</HI>
shell, in the midst is a Marble
Fountaine of curious worke,
wherein out of the Wolves
mouthes comes water. This
place is pav'd with the same
materiall as all the streets of the
City are, to wit, Brick; so that
here and indeed throughout all
<HI>Siena,</HI> in the fowlest weather
one may walke as cleane as
within dores. The houses are
for the most part Brick, built
<HI>alla Moderna,</HI> the chiefest is
that of the Pope, and the
Arch bishops, who is of the fa∣mily
of the <HI>Picolominys.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Strada larga</HI> lives the
Prince <HI>Matthias,</HI> the Duke of
<HI>Florence's</HI> Brother, a man ve∣ry
courteous to strangers.</P>
<P>Close by his Palace is the
<HI>Dome,</HI> or Cathedrall Church of
<PB N="54" REF="51"/>
<HI>Sienna,</HI> which though in com∣parison
of others in <HI>Italy</HI> is
but small, yet for the great tra∣vell
and expence which it must
needs have cost, tis inferiour
to none, tis both without and
within of Black and white
Marble; The <HI>Facade</HI> is admi∣rable,
garnisht with statues;
About the inside are the heads
of all the Popes; The Pulpet
is an unparalelld piece, beset
with figures of Marble. But
that singularity which this
Temple boasts of above all o∣thers,
is the pavement, where∣on
many parts of the sacred hi∣story
are so lively represented
in severall colours of Marble,
as no pensill can come neere it,
though many Masters take pat∣terne
from those stones. Going
up to the high Altar, at the left
hand is the Library, painted
<PB N="55" REF="51"/>
by <HI>Raphel d' Ʋrbino;</HI> On the
same side is a Chappell, where∣in
is kept the arme of S. <HI>John
Baptist,</HI> which (as an Inscrip∣tion
there manifesteth) was gi∣ven
to a Pope by the King of
<HI>Peloponesus.</HI></P>
<P>Opposite to the <HI>Dome</HI> is the
Hospitall, whither all Pil∣grimmes
in their passage to
to <HI>Rome,</HI> may come and take
two or three meales <HI>gratis.</HI> In
the Chappell lyes the body of
their founder <HI>B. Susorius,</HI> as
yet uncorrupted though nine
hundred yeares since he dyed.</P>
<P>Going downe the Hill, from
the Hospitall, one comes to the
<HI>Ponte Brande,</HI> which is a reser∣vitoire
of Fish, not so much
for the publick use, as delight,
or pastime.</P>
<P>Hard by is the House where
<HI>Santa Catharina</HI> of <HI>Siena</HI> liv'd,
<PB N="56" REF="52"/>
which, though a place of speci∣all
devotion, yet not so fre∣quented
as the <HI>Madonna di Pro∣venzana.</HI>
From hence going
up the hill, by the <HI>Dominicans</HI>
one sees the Fortification, the
onely defence of the City, and
there by the <HI>Cavalrizza,</HI> whi∣ther
in the sommer all the Gen∣try
retire a <HI>Spasso.</HI></P>
<P>The walls of <HI>Siena</HI> are of an
exceeding compasse, yet but
slight, coverd with <HI>Caper</HI> trees;
that fruit growing best in that
Soyle, to wit, Morter.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Sienna,</HI>
principally towards the <HI>Marem∣mas</HI>
or Marshes, is filld with all
sorts of great Chase, so that
wilde Boare, and other veni∣son
in its season is sold in the
Butchers shops, as commonly
as other flesh.</P>
<P>In a word, I found <HI>Sienna</HI> the
<PB N="57" REF="52"/>
most commodious place a
stranger could pick out to live
retiredly, and make his time
beneficiall. Where after two
moneths stay, having made
some little progresse in the lan∣guage,
the time of Easter oc∣casionly
urging, together with
good company, and the holy
week, we set on for <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>From hence the way conti∣nues
very even, till one comes
to a rude and stony descent;
downe into a valley, from the
top of which is a most pleasant
prospect, on the Lake of <HI>Bol∣sena,</HI>
thirty miles in circuit;
in the midst thereof are two
little Ilands; In the one is a
Convent of <HI>Capuchins,</HI> where
those of the family of the <HI>Far∣nese</HI>
are interd, the other not
inhabited unlesse by Fisher∣men.
At the side of the Lake
stands <HI>Bolsena,</HI> on the ruines of
the ancient <HI>Vulsinium,</HI> famous
in the <HI>Romans</HI> time. Some mo∣numents
<PB N="61" REF="54"/>
of its former glory,
yet stand chiefly in the Court
of <HI>Santa Christiana's</HI> Church,
as an Ancient Urne, having Li∣ons
heads, <HI>Cornucopias, Sa∣tyres,

art as now the world cannot

heathnish altar of Ophit stone,
frequent pieces of <HI>Diaspre</HI> Pil∣lars;
from hence wee may ga∣ther
that the <HI>Volsinienses,</HI> were
once splendid though now bu∣ried

<P>Distant from <HI>Bolsena</HI> seven

celebrated many Sacrifices to

<P>The publick Fountaines at

<P>Without <HI>Viterbo</HI> are two

<P>'Tis built in a Heptagon, or
seven corners, before it is a

But that for w<SUP>ch</SUP> this place

which besides the amplenesse
thereof, is as well stord with
wine of all sorts, the Duke al∣lowing
to all strangers that
come to see his house, two, or
three glasses of fresh liquor.</P>
<P>Hence, though late at night,
we departed, and strooke again
into the <HI>Via nuova,</HI> at <HI>Monte∣rose</HI>
where we lay; From <HI>Mon∣terose</HI>
to <HI>Rome,</HI> are twenty <HI>Ita∣lian</HI>
miles, all which Countrey

that if in <HI>Florus</HI> his time, the
memory of the <HI>Veientes</HI> was so
extirpated, what signes or rem∣nants
of them can we expect in

<P>Six mile beyond <HI>Monterose,</HI>
upon the <HI>Via Cassia,</HI> stands <HI>Bac∣cano,</HI>

<P>After <HI>Baccano,</HI> there is a pas∣sage

through a wood <HI>(Maesia</HI>

<P>Which before I enter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rome.</NOTE> I can∣not

were, to have seen our Saviour
in the flesh, to have heard Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> preach, and to have seen
<HI>Rome</HI> in its glory; which last,
if ranged amongst the two for∣mer
by so learned a Father, it
must needs be one of the hap∣piest
sights mortall eye could
attaine to.</P>
<P>I must confesse the fame of
<HI>Rome,</HI> which hath spread it selfe
even to the most remote parts
<PB N="68" REF="58"/>
of the earth; together with the
small intelligence I had in those
histories, that declare the
greatnesse of that universall
Monarchy, made my <HI>Idea</HI> of
<HI>Rome</HI> to exceed that of all the
world besides; yet again when
I conceived, how all humane
things are by succession of time
subject to change; how at the
fall of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire this
City was pillag'd by the Barba∣rous,
how through the insati∣able
fury of <HI>Nero,</HI> the fire de∣vour'd
it, I imagind some lower
fancy of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>But in the conclusion, ha∣ving
had a full ocular view
thereof, I found that it flouri∣sheth
beyond all expectation,
this New even emulous to ex∣ceed

Next to these, passing

so cald, because from thence
one hath most parr of <HI>Rome</HI> in

some in <HI>Terrace,</HI> others low, in

vast Pine Apple of Mettall,
which stood on the top of <HI>Mo∣les

of the same materiall which
stood on <HI>Scipio's</HI> Tombe; The
other gardens are fild with
groves of Orange trees, and ad∣mirable
Fountaines, amongst
which the artificiall Ship is
most dilectable. In the last gar∣den
in Niches, shut up are the

the Massacre of <HI>France,</HI>

<P>The gardens of <HI>Justinian</HI>

which are for the most part
Urnes of stone, amongst which
is <HI>Minu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius Felix</HI> his; Here is

<P>From thence we went to the
<HI>Villa Borghese</HI> Which without
exempt may for all excellencies
bee preferr'd before any other
about <HI>Rome</HI> or in <HI>Italy;</HI> Before
we came into the Parke, wee
past through a little house,
where the artificiall raine: with
the diversity of waterworks,
by putting on severall heads,
on the same fountaine is very
<PB N="95" REF="71"/>
ingenuous. The gardens and
Parke want nothing which
should make a man conceive
himselfe in Paradise. Groves
of Laurells, Pines, Cypresses,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Haires, Deares, Peacocks,
Swans, Feasants, and all recrea∣tions
the world can afford. In
the gardens the foure <HI>Sphinxes</HI>
of ancient stone are to be noted.
The outside of the house is a∣dornd
with foure Frontis∣pieces
of ancient Sculptures, in
<HI>Basso Relievo,</HI> amongst which,
<HI>Curtius</HI> falling into the <HI>Vorago,
Europa</HI> beard away on a Bull,
<HI>Leda</HI> suckt by a Swan are most
exquisite; Within the house
the Hall beset with Pillars of
Porphyre, and other precious
stone, <HI>Seneca</HI> bleeding to death
of Jet; The great <HI>Diana</HI> that
<HI>Pompey</HI> worshipt of Orien∣tall
Marble, The <HI>Gladiatour</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="72"/>
menacing the heavens, The

for new pieces the <HI>Daphny</HI> and
<HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>Another day, in the morn∣ing
we lookt, into the <HI>Palazzo

which is one of the great∣est,
and most royall about
<HI>Rome;</HI> In the Court the Rowes
of Marble Pillars and the <HI>Ar∣cades,</HI>
are very magnificent,
Here about where this Pallace
stands, was the <HI>Campus Marti∣us.</HI></P>
<P>From thence we went to the
<HI>Palazzo Farnese,</HI> but in the way
wee tooke a full view of the
<HI>Rotunda,</HI> or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vid. Rom. An∣tic. pag. 248.</NOTE> <HI>Pantheon,</HI> the

<P><PB N="97" REF="72"/>
There was an Ascent into the
<HI>Pantheon</HI> in the ancient times,
but now one goes downe into
it, (from whence I collect how
the ruines of old <HI>Rome</HI> lay bu∣ried
in the earth; besides, if
there be any digging for to lay
the foundations of a house in
<HI>Rome,</HI> they still finde pieces of
statues, heads of Pillars, and the
like) yet for height it wants
nothing of its first, and indeed
to this day it seemes rather the
worke of Giants, then com∣mon
men. So vast are the thir∣teen
Columns in the Porch, so
stupenduous the <HI>Moles</HI> within,

with the motto <HI>Exterpentur.</HI>
Against this Church stands the

<P>From thence we went to the
<HI>Villa Montalto on the Viminal,</HI>

with thousand rarities. In re∣turning,
wee saw the Church
from whence the <HI>Arrians</HI> were
expeld, together with the <HI>Villa
Aldobrandina.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoone wee walkt

<P>The sixth day in the morn∣ing
wee went to <HI>Saint Peters,</HI>
where wee saw his S. carried
about in Pompe, with his triple

feet, to humble him∣selfe.</P>
<P>In the afternoone, wee walkt

<PB N="108" REF="79"/>
passing along the <HI>Tyber,</HI> wee

<P>On good Friday wee went
to S. <HI>Peters,</HI> wherein his San∣ctities
Chappell wee saw most
admirable Representations.
And there wee found opportu∣nity
to goe into the Vaults, un∣der
<HI>Saint Peters,</HI> where we saw

On the <HI>Palatin</HI> the <HI>Temple

<P>One morning we went to <HI>S.

<P>From thence we went to the

as pleasing to the judicious, as
the other delights of the gar∣dens
to the ignorant.</P>
<P>The same day about the Eve∣ning,
we went to the <HI>Greeks</HI>
Church where wee saw the
Ceremonies of the Easterne
Churches, and heard their Ser∣vice
<PB N="113" REF="81"/>
all in <HI>Greek.</HI> On Easter
day wee went to <HI>Saint Peters,</HI>
to see the manner of his S. re∣ceiving
the Eucharist: The
rest of that day wee repos'd to
fit our selves for the voyage of
<HI>Naples,</HI> so that now after so
satisfactory a sight of this Mi∣stris
of the world <HI>Rome,</HI> we bid
her adieu for a time, leaving
what we now omitted till our
Returne.</P>
<P>The voyage from <HI>Rome</HI> to
<HI>Naples,</HI> though it bee the most
dangerous passage in <HI>Italy,</HI> be∣cause
the wayes are so throng'd
with <HI>Banditos,</HI> yet in the up∣shot
it proves no lesse requisite
to mindes inquisitive in the
Roman Antiquities; no lesse
delightfull to men that would
see the Wonders of Nature,
then any other in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There is all the way so many
<PB N="114" REF="82"/>
fragments of the Roman glo∣ry,
that tis hard to judge whi∣ther
<HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> were
once joynd together, or whi∣ther
<HI>Pozzuolo</HI> was the Suburbe
of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>From whence wee set forth
out of <HI>Port. Lat:</HI> anciently
<HI>Asinaria;</HI> a mile out of the Ci∣ty
there are on all sides pieces

hand we left the Aquiducts of

with the new of <HI>Sixtus Quintus</HI>
not so stately as the old, on
which the <HI>Aqua Felice</HI> runnes

where lies the Pyramid
that the old Earle of <HI>Arundell</HI>

The territorie of <HI>Frescati,</HI> as
it was the ancient delight of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> so it is as yet coverd
with Gardens and Villas, about
ten Cardinalls having their
Countrey seats there. A place
of such ravishing delights, as fit∣ter's
for the Gods to inhabit
then men. Such is the Quanti∣ty
of trees, which keep perpe∣tually
green, the murmuring
of Fountaines and the like.</P>
<P>Amongst the the Villa's, the
chiefe, and which wonderful∣ly
declares the ingenuity of the
<HI>Italians,</HI> is the <HI>Aldobrandina,</HI>
which for divises in water is the
first within or without <HI>Rome,</HI>
I think I may say in the world.
Quite through the garden, falls
a Cataract, or deluge of water,
towards the Embushment of
which, stand two Serpentin
Pillars of Mosaick, from the
<PB N="118" REF="84"/>
tops of which, the water creeps
downe; Below in the Court is
that admirable Fountaine, in
which is represented <HI>Atlas</HI>
throwing up water, which
forceth artificiall Thunder, and
a perfect Rainbow; Whil'st the
Elements seeme here to bee at
difference; A Satyre blowes a
horne lowder then I ever heard
a man; And <HI>Pan</HI> in the Inter∣im,
playes two diverse tunes
upon the Organes: Things
that strike astonishment to all
the Spectators, which whoso∣ever
they be, must looke to goe
away wet to the skinne, as we
did, and from thence went in∣to
a place cald the terrestiall
Paradise, and not undeserved∣ly;
for as the other inventions
are mov'd by water, so these
goe by wind. At the end of it
is fashiond a hill, <HI>Parnassus</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="84"/>
whereon set the nine Muses
with severall winde Instru∣ments
that sound by art. Un∣derneath
this hill are Organs,
which plaid divers tunes so di∣stinctly,
that wee conceiv'd
some Master was playing on
them, but looking wee saw
they went of themselves, the
cause of all this wee afterwards
saw; In the midst of the roome,
there being a Hole out of wch
winde issueth, so violently,
that for halfe a quarter of an
houre it beares up a Ball.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Frescati,</HI> that after∣noone
we past by <HI>Diana's</HI> Lake,
and the wood famous for the
fiction of <HI>Acteon.</HI> From thence
wee had a woody and mounta∣nous
way unto <HI>Veletri,</HI> where
wee lay, <HI>Veletri</HI> heretofore be∣longd
to the <HI>Volsci,</HI> and the an∣cestors
of <HI>Augustus</HI> came from
thence.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="85"/>
The best things to be seen in
it now is the statue of Pope
<HI>Ʋrban</HI> the eight, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rasse, and
the publick fountaines.</P>
<P>The next morning having
past downe the hill, whereon
<HI>Veletri</HI> stands, wee came into a
plaine Country, and din'd at
<HI>Sermoneta,</HI> fifteen miles from
<HI>Veletri.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoone, about
three miles from <HI>Sermoneta,</HI> we
past by a Tower, built on the
top of a Rock, to defend the
Country from Robbery, as
they say, though I believe more
to take money for passage,
through the Gate below.</P>
<P>Five <HI>Italian</HI> miles farther,
neere to the <HI>Casa Nuova,</HI> and
<HI>casa Biancha</HI> at the foot of the
hills, at the left are the <HI>Tres Ta∣bernae,</HI>
or <HI>three Tavernes,</HI> where
the Brethren met Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> in
<PB N="121" REF="85"/>
his voyage to <HI>Rome;</HI> according
to the <HI>Acts.</HI> They shew them∣selves

<P>That night wee lay at <HI>Piper∣no,</HI>
at the Post house on the
other side of the Hill; but be∣fore
we there arriv'd, wee saw
the Quarters of many <HI>Banditas</HI>
hangd on the high way side, an
argument of the great hazard
one undergoes in this journey,
if not a competent number to∣gether.
<HI>Piperno</HI> heretofore <HI>Pri∣vernum</HI>
was a City of the <HI>Volsci,</HI>
noted onely for the Birth of
<HI>Virgills Camilla,</HI> who came

mention'd by Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> in his

<P>This street if I may so call

are ten miles, which way lying
in the Confines of the State of

From thence keeping right
on the <HI>Via Appia,</HI> plaine and

<P>In the afternoone eight miles
from <HI>Mola,</HI> we came unto <HI>Gari∣gliano,</HI>

<HI>Minturna</HI> stood, as a very en∣tire

with many other ruines te∣stifie.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="92"/>
Having past here the river

<P>That night wee lay in <HI>Ager

<P>The <HI>Ager Falernus</HI> is all that

From <HI>Capua</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> the way
<PB N="138" REF="94"/>
is even, spacious, and like a gar∣den,
tis indeed <HI>Campania.</HI> The
fertility of which is such, that
if the owner have not as much
Wine out of one Vine, as will
load five Mules, he thinkes his
labour ill spent, an incredible,
though true argument of the
fruitfullnesse, of this Countrey.
In the mid-way stands <HI>An∣versa,</HI>
and eight miles farther
<HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>This Metropolis of that
Kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naples.</NOTE> which takes its de∣nomination
from thence, is a
Maritimate on the <HI>Mediterra∣nean</HI>
shoare.</P>
<P>Tis ancient, though <HI>Neapolis,</HI>
and was first cald <HI>Parthenope.</HI>
At this present tis reckond the
third City in <HI>Italy,</HI> and so great
are the delights which nature
hath allowed to this place, that
tis still frequented by men of
<PB N="139" REF="94"/>
high condition, and great per∣sonages,
so that it hath taken
the Epethite, <HI>Naples</HI> the Gen∣tle.</P>
<P>The streets of <HI>Naples</HI> are ge∣nerally
well pav'd of free∣stone,
especially that of <HI>Toledo,</HI>
very large and even. Which in∣deed
is necessarie, here in re∣gard
of the multitude of
Coaches that passe to and
fro. The Houses are very uni∣forme,
built flat, at the top to
walke on, a notable conveni∣ence
in these hot parts.</P>
<P>Another like accommodati∣on
which this City hath, against
the heats is the <HI>Mole,</HI> which is
like an Artificiall street casting
it selfe into the Sea, hither all
the Gentry at the evening re∣tire
to take the <HI>Fresco.</HI></P>
<P>At the end of the <HI>Mole</HI> is the
<HI>Fanal,</HI> and underneath a foun∣taine,
<PB N="140" REF="95"/>
with the statues of the
old Dieties of <HI>Parthenope.</HI></P>
<P>From thence one hath in
view the mountanous Iland
<HI>Capreas,</HI> the delight of <HI>Tybe∣rius.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst the Palaces of <HI>Na∣plee,</HI>
the <HI>Vice Kings</HI> then <HI>Duca
d' Arcos</HI> is the fairest. There
are three Castles, <HI>S. Elmo</HI> above,
<HI>Castel nuovo, Castello del Ovo</HI>
below. The Churches are ge∣nerally
the best I ever came in∣to,
fild with Marbles, chiefly
the Carthusians, the Jesuits,
the Bishops Chappell.</P>
<P>The onely Antiquity within
the City, is at the <HI>Theatins</HI>
Church, which was a Temple
of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> the Fron∣tispiece,
or Porch of ancient
Pillars, with a Greek Inscrip∣tion
over it (which Language
this City spake when it was
<PB N="141" REF="95"/>
cald <HI>Parthenope)</HI> as likewise
the remnants of their two Sta∣tues
yet standing; The Inscrip∣tion
is this.</P>

<P>It beiug <HI>May</HI> while we staide
at <HI>Naples,</HI> We saw the famous
Miracle of the bloud of <HI>Santo

<P><HI>Naples</HI> is extremely popu∣lous,

he that desires to live a retired,

set up there; as the gardens are
fild with Oranges, so the houses
want not for Lemmon.</P>

in the midst is a <HI>Madonna,</HI> with
a Lampe perpetually burning,
the words at the Incounter
are <HI>Alla Marina, Alla Mon∣tagne.</HI></P>
<P>At the going out of the Grot∣te,
wee strooke towards the
right, and arriv'd at the <HI>Grotta
del Cane,</HI> which hath some in∣nate
property, to kill every
living thing that enters, if not
<PB N="150" REF="100"/>
speedily cast into the lake <HI>Agna∣no,</HI>
15. paces distant. We saw the
experiment, (as for the most
part it is shewn) in a Dog,
which seem'd to loose his vi∣tall
force by degrees, but after∣wards
being throwne into the
Lake, reviv'd.</P>
<P>Hard by are the Stowes of
<HI>San Gennaro</HI> reasonable hot,
with the odour of Sulphure.</P>
<P>Hence turning to the left, we
came to <HI>Capuchins,</HI> and saw
the stone whereon <HI>San Gen
naro</HI> was beheaded, with <HI>Nasita</HI>
a Mountaine in the Sea, and a
little towards the right hand,
is the <HI>Sulphatara,</HI> or hill of
<HI>Brimstone,</HI> on which no grasse
or hearb growes, but tis all
white with ashes, it still cast∣ing
out of severall holes a con∣tinuall
smoke, with Flame, ma∣king
the very earth to boile.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="100"/>
The ground is hollow under∣neath,
and makes a hidious
noise if strooke upon with a
Hammer, or the like. These
hills were cald by the ancient
<HI>Leucogei; Campus Phlegraeus,</HI>
and <HI>Forum Vulcani,</HI> whose
Kingdome (if in any part of
the world) is here about, the
Fire breaking out even in the
high wayes. Here they com∣pose
Medicinall Pots of Brim∣stone.</P>
<P>Advancing forward, into
the Suburbs of <HI>Pozzuoles,</HI> wee
saw an <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> and <HI>Ci∣ceros</HI>
house, cald <HI>Academia.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards being come to
the Port, wee tooke a barque,
to passe over the bay, which is
round about, fild with rem∣nants
of those Romans magni∣ficence,
that liv'd there.</P>
<P>The first place wee saw after
<PB N="152" REF="101"/>
wee were set to Land, was the
<HI>Mercato del Sabbato</HI> formerly a
a <HI>Cirque;</HI> and the buriall place of
the ancient Romans.</P>
<P>From thence we past through
the <HI>Elisian Fields</HI> (as they call
them) a plaine spot of Earth,
between the <HI>Mount Misenus,</HI> &amp;
the <HI>Augustins</HI> Convent of twen∣ty
Acres, and came to the an∣cient
<HI>Misenus,</HI> so cal'd from
the Trumpeter of <HI>Aeneas</HI> there
interd, the old Poets cald it <HI>A
erius,</HI> because of the many
Sotteran Caves in it; of which
many are yet to be seen.</P>
<P>The chiefe is the <HI>Piscina Mi∣rabili;</HI>
before which is the
<HI>Mare Mortuum.</HI> This <HI>Piscina</HI>
cald <HI>mirabili,</HI> because of the
wonderfull art tis built with,
was a reserver of fresh water
for the Navie, which, (because
this stands so neare the Sea) was
<PB N="153" REF="101"/>
brought sixtie mile. It hath
eleven Pillars in the length,
foure in breadth, about foure
and fourty in all. The materi∣all
tis plaisterd with, in the in∣side
is as durable as stone, yet
no man knowes of what it is
compos'd, some conceive it to
be of the whites of Egges, and
dust of Marble mingled toge∣ther.</P>
<P>From hence leaving <HI>Lucullus</HI>
his house at the left, wee went
downe into the <HI>Cento Camerel∣le,</HI>
or <HI>Nerôs</HI> hundred Cham∣bers,
where hee kept his Priso∣ners,
a most hidious place.</P>
<P>Below that towards the Sea∣side
is the Temple of <HI>Hercules,</HI>
the place where <HI>Agrippina, Ne∣ros</HI>
Mother was kild, the Pes∣cheries
of <HI>Hortensius, Tacitus</HI>
his sons house, with many other
ancient fragments which we
<PB N="154" REF="102"/>
saw though with much paines.</P>
<P>From thence we tooke boat
for <HI>Baia,</HI> where the Castle built
by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth of <HI>France</HI> is
strong, going thither we could
discerne the foundations of
<HI>Cimeria,</HI> and old <HI>Baia</HI> under∣neath
the Sea, with the <HI>Via
Consularis</HI> overwhelm'd by
the water, and on the shoare
nothing but ruines.</P>
<P>Hereabouts <HI>Caron</HI> was feign'd
to passe with his Boate. Here
we set againe to Land, and saw
the Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> the Se∣pulcher
of <HI>Agrippina,</HI> with di∣verse
figures, and her Pallace
of the same worke. The Tem∣ple
of <HI>Diana</HI> at the left, the
Bathes of <HI>Trullius;</HI> The houses
of <HI>Marius Pompey, Nero</HI> standing
aloft.</P>
<P>Hereabout the Sea water is
naturally hot: Hard by we went
<PB N="155" REF="102"/>
into <HI>Ciceros</HI> Bathes, as gallant
and entire an Antiquity as any
in the <HI>Tract</HI> of <HI>Pozzuolo;</HI> These
waters were so soveraigne, not
many years since over most dis∣eases,
that over every Bath
was written for what cures it
was good, of which Inscripti∣ons
some letters yet stand, but
the Physitians of <HI>Palermo</HI> (as
they tell the story) finding those
waters prejudiciall to their cu∣stome,
went with instruments
expresly, and demolisht those
writings (so that for the present
they are unusefull) the said
Physitians, being all cast away
in their returne.</P>
<P>From these Bathes we went
up to the Stowes of <HI>Tritola</HI> ex∣treamely
hot, even to Suffoca∣cation,
yet contrary to the
<HI>Grottadel Cane,</HI> that choking
below, and harmelesse above,
<PB N="156" REF="103"/>
these coole and refreshing be∣low,
but almost stifeling a∣bove.</P>
<P>From thence we took horse,
and past by the <HI>Lacus Lucrinus,</HI>
the greater part whereof is now
coverd with the <HI>Monte Nuovo,</HI>
which mountaine (as their tra∣dition
is) was rais'd in one
night, a mile high, from the
ashes which came out of <HI>Sul∣fatara,</HI>
and so coverd the <HI>Lu∣crin
Lake. Tommaso Fonnare</HI> an
old man of <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI> that dyed
three yeares since remem∣bred
of that mountaines being
made in one night a hundred
yeares agoe.</P>
<P>After that wee rode to the
<HI>Lake Avernus,</HI> where abouts
was the <HI>Poets Acheron</HI> or de∣scent
into hell, at one side of
the Lake is the Temple of <HI>A∣pollo;</HI>
at the other, the <HI>Sybilla
<PB N="157" REF="103"/>
Cumanas</HI> Grotte. Tis very spa∣cious,
at the end is a Magnificent
ascent where the Oracle stood,
with the way that lead to <HI>Cuma,</HI>
Her bath yet stands, and her
Chambers painted in Mosaick
worke, yet all under ground,
as indeed most of the aforesaid
Antiquities (excepting the
Temples) are.</P>
<P>In returning to <HI>Pozzuolo,</HI>
we saw the Mount <HI>Gaurus,</HI> from
whence came the best <HI>Falernum,</HI>
now cald <HI>Barbaro,</HI> it being al∣together
sterile. In <HI>Puteoli</HI> there
are some Antiquities, as the
Temple of <HI>Neptune,</HI> &amp;c. In the
Port are the vast ruines of <HI>Cali∣gulas</HI>
Bridge, which past three
mile crosse the Sea, from <HI>Pozzu∣oles</HI>
to <HI>Baia.</HI></P>
<P>After dinner wee went back
to <HI>Naples,</HI> In the way wee saw
the Lions, Austriches, and o∣ther
<PB N="158" REF="104"/>
wild beasts and fowles, that
a certaine Prince keeps.</P>
<P>Having repos'd a day after
this troublesome, yet satisfacto∣ry
voyage of <HI>Pozzuoles,</HI> the
next morning wee set out of
the quite contrary part of Na∣ples,
to see that Miracle of Na∣ture,
the Brother of <HI>Aetna, Ve∣suvius,</HI>
so famous for its last e∣ruption.</P>

Going up higher tis hidi∣ous
to behold the deep cracks
in the Earth, through which
the streames of Sulphure past,
all about lyes scatterd the se∣verall
materialls it cast forth;
Some like mettall, other like
Pitch, Brimstone and the like,
with such vast stones, as (I
speake the least) foure porters
would not able to carrie one of
them</P>
<P>Being come so neere the top,
as we could with our horses, we
were forc't to alight, and to
crawle up the steeper part,
which is all coverd with a red∣dish
<PB N="162" REF="106"/>
substance, that sounds like
earthen vessells, some conceive
it to be Pumie stone burnt, after
this wee got up though weary
to the top; where the <HI>Vorago</HI> is
so terrifying a spectacle, that if
I would paint Hell, this would
be the best Patterne; It is a hole
about three mile in compasse,
and about halfe as much in
depth, in the midst is a new hill
that still vomits thick smoke,
which the fire within hath rais'd
within few yeares, it daily in∣creaseth,
and when tis growne
to a fuller Bulke <HI>caveat Neapo∣lis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> the Naturalist too In∣quisitive
after the cause of this
intestine fire chang'd lives with
Death on this Mountaine.</P>
<P>In returning, as we were tir'd
in getting up, so wee went ea∣sily
down, though almost up to
<PB N="163" REF="106"/>
the knees in ashes.</P>
<P>This Mountaine was the <HI>Ʋl∣tima
Meta</HI> of our voyage to <HI>Na∣ples,</HI>
wherefore having with
much content seen these won∣derfull
things of Antiquity,
Nature, and Curiosity; after
some few dayes we parted from
<HI>Naples</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> treading the
same path we had before trac't,
At our going out of the King∣dome,
they made us pay five
times, for our Vallees, although
they could finde no prohibited
goods; At our entrance they
let us passe quietly, without
paying a farthing.</P>
<P>All the way to <HI>Rome</HI> I saw
nothing observable, but what
I had before spoken of, onely
I would not omit the great
quantity of <HI>Bufferos</HI> (Beasts
which furnish the Souldiery
with their skins) that we met in
the Countrey.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="107"/>
The day after our returne to
<HI>Rome,</HI> wee walkt to <HI>San Seba∣stiano,</HI>
where a mercenary Fry∣ar
let us downe into the <HI>Roma
Sotterranea,</HI> or <HI>Rome</HI> under
ground, those hallowed Ca∣vernes
where the Church in her
Infancy shelterd her selfe from
persecution; there is a most im∣mense
Folio out on this Subject.
Tis now indeed a City for the
Dead, where in every street are
pild gradually one above ano∣ther,
the Corps of Martyrs, to
which some Monuments are
added with no other Epitaphs
then this, <HI>Pro Christo.</HI></P>
<P>This place is as stupendious
for the rarity as venerable for
the Antiquity: The natives of
<HI>Rome</HI> know not how farre these
Vaults continue under the
Earth; yet some miles they say
are already discoverd, with so
<PB N="165" REF="107"/>
many <HI>Maeanders,</HI> that hee who
adventures to enter without an
experienc't Guide may (as some
<HI>French</HI> men did) goe into his
grave living, yet increase the
Bill of Mortality.</P>
<P>From thence wee went into
the <HI>Transtevere,</HI> saw first <HI>Mon∣torio,</HI>
formerly the <HI>Janiculum,</HI>
and the Chappell where <HI>(ut
aiunt)</HI> Saint <HI>Peter</HI> was crucifi∣fied.
In the Church lies buried
the Count <HI>Tiron Oneille</HI> of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI>
who comming to <HI>Rome</HI>
in devotion dyed, very poore,
yet for his good service in the
Catholique Cause, hath a

<P>From thence wee went
down into many rich Churches,
where the Primitive Christians
were martyrd; In one to wit,
<HI>Santa Maria Transteverana</HI> is the
Fountaine of Oyle that arose,
at our Saviours birth; Some
stones that were tide at the Mar∣tyrs
feet when they were
drown'd, with other manner
of Torments that they were put
to; In the same Church are ve∣ry
rare pillars of Porphyre, and
other stone taken from <HI>Aureli∣ans</HI>
baths. Thus every day pro∣duc't
a new sight to us, but I
would not passe by our Voyage
to <HI>Tivoli,</HI> which was as follow∣eth.</P>
<P>Setting forth out of <HI>Rome,</HI> at
<HI>Porta di San Lorenzo</HI> five miles
<PB N="167" REF="108"/>
from the City, we saw a Bridge
over the <HI>Teverone,</HI> built by <HI>Ma∣mea,</HI>
the Mother of <HI>Severus;</HI> A
little forwarder the Sepulcher
of <HI>Valerius Volusi,</HI> and ancient
Tombes without number; On
farther theres a place cald <HI>Fide
nates,</HI> and a Sulphurious River,
A Bridge cald <HI>Ponte Lucano,</HI>
and an ancient Tower garnisht
with Inscriptions, that stands
for the Sepulcher of <HI>Plauti∣us.</HI></P>
<P>When wee were come to <HI>Ti∣voli,</HI>
wee went to see those won∣derfull
<HI>Eliziums,</HI> which the
Cardinall <HI>d' Este</HI> at most Roy∣all
expence hath there in pos∣session;
the sight whereof in my
Opinion, may at this present
draw as many to see <HI>Tivoli,</HI> as
<HI>Rome</HI> with all her Merveiles.</P>
<P>This shall be my patterne for
a Countrey seat; <HI>All Regale,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="109"/>
and therefore I'le not omit any
Particular.</P>
<P>First tis evident, the Hill was
made even, and upon that <HI>Pi∣azza</HI>
this Pallace was erected;
which is built of square stone,
and all things answerable to a
Kingly <HI>Grandezza.</HI></P>
<P>At the right hand are those
Gardens which they call the se∣cret,
in which there are sixteen
huge Lavers of Marble, that
cast forth Chrystalline water,
in the midst of these stands a <HI>Ja∣nus
Quadrifrons</HI> higher then
those, which makes foure more
fountaines that resemble Look∣ing
Glasses.</P>
<P>At the left there's a sumptu∣ous
Place for all manner of
Exercises, or Turnaments. The
<HI>Facciata</HI> or Front hath between
the Windowes many ancient
Statues, and so the first Porch
<PB N="169" REF="109"/>
with most ample steps in the as∣cent
to the Palace.</P>
<P>Before this, theres a most
glorious Fountaine, with the
Statue of <HI>Leda;</HI> And foure
vast and most delicious gardens
in view.</P>
<P>Passing down the steps which
have Piles of Water on both
sides, amongst the Groves theres
these Fountaines of <HI>Tethys, Es∣culapius,
Arethusa, Pandora, Po∣mona,</HI>
and <HI>Flora.</HI> Afterwards
theres the stately <HI>Pegasus</HI> in
<HI>Pamossa.</HI> The two Colosses of
the <HI>Sybilla Tyburtina,</HI> and <HI>Me∣licerta.</HI>
The <HI>Cupids</HI> powring
water out of their Flaskes are
most ingenious, next there
are some Urnes, upon which
stand ten Nymphes, and in the
midst the Caves of the <HI>Sybilla,
Tiburtina,</HI> and <HI>Diana,</HI> God∣desse
of the Woods. Both a∣adornd
<PB N="170" REF="110"/>
with fountaines, sta∣tues,
Roots of Corall, Mo∣ther
of Pearle, and pav'd with
Mosaick worke.</P>
<P>On the other side of the Gar∣den
sets <HI>Rome</HI> triumphant, in
the midst of her most Memora∣ble
Fabricks, as the Pantheon,
Capitoll, Cirques, Theatres,
Amphitheatres, Obelisques,
Mausoleos, Archs Triumphall,
Pyramids, Aquiducts, Porti∣cos,
Thermas, and the like. Nei∣ther
is the River <HI>Tyber</HI> want∣ing;
for out of the Wolfe and
Twinnes gusheth a Rivolet,
proportionable to that Repre∣sentative
City.</P>
<P>In the next garden theres the
<HI>Ʋccellario,</HI> where amonst the
Branches of Trees, Artificiall
Birds move their Wings and
sing sweetly; on a sudden an
Owle appears, and they change
<PB N="171" REF="110"/>
their Melody into a chattering
admiration.</P>
<P>Not farre from thence is the
Fountaine of Dragons, which
vomit forth the water with a
most horrid Noyse.</P>
<P>The Grotte of Nature where
the Organs play most harmoni∣ously
by the motion of Water.
In the garden that followes are
diverse Lakelike conservatories
of Fish, with Swans, here the
<HI>Mete Sudanti,</HI> the Ocean with
Neptune in his Charriot on Sea
Horse are most stupenduous.
In the last the <HI>Triton</HI> and thou∣sand
exotick Plants are to bee
seen.</P>
<P>Tyr'd with these Master-Pieces
of Art, wee went to that
Naturall <HI>Cascata,</HI> or <HI>Cataract</HI>
at <HI>Tivoli,</HI> which is made by the
precipitious fall of the River
<HI>Anien</HI> from the Mountaines, it
<PB N="172" REF="111"/>
rusheth downe with that Fury,
that there is still a thick mist o∣ver
it, and by the Reflexion of
the Sun ariseth a perfect Rain∣bow.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> mentioneth this River
to have that Innate Quality to
Petrifie the ground it passeth
through, or any thing that lies
long in it. The Sulphurious
streame I above mention'd
flowes from this.</P>
<P>Neere to this is an old Tem∣ple,
some say of <HI>Hercules,</HI> others
adjudge it to the <HI>Sibylla Tybur∣tina,</HI>
or <HI>Albunea,</HI> and the more
propable, for <HI>Tivoli</HI> was anci∣ently
<HI>Tybur. Horace</HI> and many
of the Roman Magnates had
their <HI>Villas</HI> here, of which they
shew their Ruines, as likewise
the Sybilles Cave.</P>
<P>Returning for <HI>Rome,</HI> one
may discerne <HI>Preneste,</HI> and a
<PB N="173" REF="111"/>
little out of the way, on the
left stands a huge moles of An∣tiquity,
the <HI>Villa Hadriana,</HI>
the heap rather of a City then a
House, tis reported hee had
there the most eminent build∣ings
of the World taken from
the Originalls, but</P>
<Q><L>—Jam seges est, ubi Troja fuit.</L></Q>
<P>I have been long in the Trans∣action
of these things, in and a∣bout
<HI>Rome,</HI> and now end some∣what
abruptly, the diversity of
things, makes my memory trea∣cherous,
I can onely say</P>
<Q><L>Roma Capo e Compendio del
Mondo</L>
<L>A cui non e cosa simile ne se∣conda.</L>
<L><HI>Rome</HI> of the world Compendi∣um
and Head</L>
<L>Admits no like, nor can be se∣conded.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="174" REF="112"/>
The heats growing on at
<HI>Rome,</HI> wee left it to set up our
station for the Summer at <HI>Sien∣na,</HI>
and having already seen
<HI>Caprarola,</HI> wee went with the
<HI>Procacccio,</HI> so that passing to
<HI>Viterbo</HI> by the <HI>Strada Nuova,</HI>
wee saw some remnants of the
<HI>Via Cassia,</HI> with <HI>Soutry</HI> where
<HI>Orlando Furioso</HI> was borne, and
the ruines of <HI>Gharlemaines</HI> Pal∣lace.</P>
<P>At the great Inne at <HI>Radico∣fany,</HI>
wee met the Marquis <HI>de
Fontenay,</HI> the French Em∣bassadour
in his voyage to
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>A week after our arrive at <HI>Si∣enna,</HI>
was an <HI>Opera</HI> represented
on the new Theatre of <HI>Prince
Matthias,</HI> with severall changes
of Sceanes, as a Garden, Sea,
Pallace, and other Machines, at
which the <HI>Italians</HI> are spoke to
be excellent.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="112"/>
All the time of our stay at
<HI>Sienna,</HI> I fild my bookes more
with observations of the Lan∣guage,
then of the people, Ci∣ty,
or Country: Onely the di∣versity
of fruits which are eve∣ry
day brought to Market; and
sold at a low rate, argues much
the fertility of <HI>Italy,</HI> as well as
the great quantity of silke it
produceth, and therefore de∣servedly
cald <HI>Bombycina;</HI> In
<HI>June</HI> was the silke Harvest, If I
may so call it, and there was
such abundance, that in <HI>England</HI>
I never saw so much Woole, as
I did here Silke.</P>
<P>The ninth of <HI>July</HI> the <HI>Sanesi∣ans</HI>
solemnizd a feast, but sore
against their wills, for <HI>Cosmus</HI>
the Duke of <HI>Florence's</HI> taking
<HI>Sienna.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> on the feast of the
Assumption of the Virgin, was
<PB N="176" REF="113"/>
a Race of <HI>Barbaries,</HI> which ran
without Riders from one gate
of the City to the Princes Pal∣lace,
for a Pallium of Cloath
of Gold.</P>
<P>The same Moneth wee went
to the <HI>Jewes</HI> Synagogue, and
saw the Circumcising of a
Child. Which the sacred Page
describes.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the seventh wee set
from <HI>Siena,</HI> to begin our returne
towards <HI>France,</HI> our first dayes
journey reacht to <HI>Florence,</HI>
where tarrying one day, the
next wee parted with the <HI>Pro∣caccio</HI>
for <HI>Venice,</HI> paying seven
Crownes a man.</P>
<P>Six miles up the <HI>Apennin</HI> we
past by <HI>Pratolin,</HI> a famous seat
of Pleasance belonging to the
great Duke; and about as ma∣ny
miles farther wee dind at <HI>Il
Ponte,</HI> before which lies a most
<PB N="177" REF="113"/>
delicious Valley, environd with
very high mountaines.</P>
<P>After dinner, about two miles
farther, wee past through <HI>Scar∣peria,</HI>
from whence we mount∣ed
more and more up the <HI>Apen∣nins,</HI>
The way in some places
but streight, &amp; on the right hand
is a very steep Precipes down to
the plaine below. All that af∣ternoon
we rode up and down
hills, which are as much fruit∣full,
as barren, and at night we
lodgd at <HI>Fiorenzuolo,</HI> a For∣tresse
which stands in the midst
of the Mountaines, at the con∣fiues
of the great Dukes Terri∣toire.</P>
<P>The next morning depart∣ing,
long before break of day,
(as the <HI>Procaccios</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> usu∣ally
doe) we perfectly discernd
the flame of <HI>Pietra Mala,</HI> a
Mountaine at the highest part
<PB N="178" REF="114"/>
of the <HI>Appinines,</HI> which perpe∣tually
burnes.</P>
<P>All that forenoone wee had
a tedious passage through the
Chesnut woods, till wee came
unto <HI>Pianora,</HI> where having
dind, by a suddain descent pas∣sing
a Torrent divers times, wee
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk into the fertile and plea∣sant
plaine of <HI>Bolonia,</HI> and so to
the City it selfe, where we pre∣vaild
with our Conductor, to
stay the rest of that day, and
halfe the following, that wee
might take a more full view of
this famous City of <HI>Bolonia,</HI>
the second in the <HI>Stato della
Chiesa.</HI></P>
<P>It is situated at the foot of the
<HI>Appenins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolonia</NOTE> the neighbouring
Countrey producing so great a∣bundance
of things necessarie
to humane life, that it hath got
the name <HI>Bolonia</HI> the Fat.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="114"/>
For strength it is not much
considerable, there being but a
single wall without Bulwarks,
Ramparts or the like, Tis a fit∣er
habitation for the Muses,
then for <HI>Mars,</HI> the fame of that
University which flourisheth
there, making this Motto com∣mon,
<HI>BOLONIA DOCET.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst the things I tooke
notice of at <HI>Bolonia,</HI> the first is
the generall uniformity in the
buildings, there running be∣fore
all the houses, a very stately
Cloyster, with Arches all of the
same structure, so that a large
street appeares one building,
which manner though it differ
from the ordinary Italian way,
yet is no lesse admirable</P>
<P>Amongst other faire edefices
of this City, the Popes Pallace
very spacious, is chiefe, over
the Gate is the statue of a Pope
in mettall.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="115"/>
Before this Pallace is the <HI>Pi∣azza,</HI>
as remakable as most in
<HI>Italy:</HI> In the midst stands a ve∣ry
sumptuous Fountaine, where
the Brasen <HI>Neptune</HI> made by
<HI>John of Bolonia,</HI> a famous Sculp∣turer
is very considerable, at
one end of this Place is the <HI>Do∣me,</HI>
not yet finisht.</P>
<P>The great Schooles are said
to be as stately as most in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
And likewise the Hospi∣talls
are worth seeing The Con∣vents
at <HI>Bolonia</HI> are generally
very glorious, especially <HI>S.
Dominick,</HI> and out of the Town
<HI>S. Michael in Bosco.</HI></P>
<P>In briefe, the <HI>Bolonians</HI> agree
with the other <HI>Italians,</HI> in ha∣ving
their houses built decent∣ly,
and in their Courts, still
have some Verts set, as Orange
trees, Cypresses, or the like,
which much pleaseth the eye
<PB N="181" REF="115"/>
of a stranger, as he passeth the
streets.</P>
<P>In the heart of the City, stands
the Tower of the <HI>Asinelli:</HI>
(cald so from a Family that
rai'sd it) some making <HI>Bolonia</HI>
to represent the forme of a ship,
set this for the maine Mast. It
is growne somewhat to decay
through time, and the staires
are very rotten, however, wee
adventurd to goe up to the top,
and from thence wee had a full
view of the Towne below,
with the streets lying in a
straight line, as likewise a
faire Prospect on the plaines of
<HI>Lombardy.</HI></P>
<P>On one side of this Tower,
is another cald <HI>Garisenda,</HI> which
seemes to fall much after the
manner of the <HI>Campanile,</HI> at
<HI>Pisa,</HI> some impute it to the
Architecture, others say it was
<PB N="182" REF="116"/>
of the same height with that of
the <HI>Asinelli;</HI> but the Citizens
fearing it would fall, pull'd
downe the upper part, and left
the rest standing crooked, as at
the present it doth.</P>
<P>This is the summe of what I
saw in <HI>Bolonia,</HI> yet berore I
went from thence, I tooke a
taste of those famous Saltsages,
that are compos'd at <HI>Bolonia,</HI>
the which are transported
thence, not onely into other
places of <HI>Italy,</HI> but also into
diverse parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as a
rare and costly dish, which
addes and maintaines her Epi∣thite
<HI>Bolonia La Grassa.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Bolonia</HI> for our
more free entrance into the
State of <HI>Venice,</HI> wee tooke a Bill
of Health.</P>
<P>The first day we past the <HI>Ca∣nall,</HI>
that goes to <HI>Ferrara,</HI> ha∣ving
<PB N="183" REF="116"/>
our boate drawne by a
Horse, in which way we went
through about nine <HI>Sustegne,</HI>
Machines not much unlike our
Sluses, to keep up and let down
the water for the turning of all
sorts of Milles, and the passage
of Boates.</P>
<P>Towards Evening wee past
by <HI>Bentivoglio,</HI> a Castle that
gave denomination to the lear∣ned
Cardinall of that name.</P>
<P>Some two houres later, wee
came to <HI>Mal Albergo,</HI> an infa∣mous
Inne, both in name and
in deed, where having poorely
supt, wee imbarqu't in ano∣ther
lesse Boate, and having past
all night through the fennes,
The next morning we arriv'd at
<HI>Ferrara.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferrara.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Ferrara</HI> heretofore a Dutchy
by it selfe, yet now subject to
the Apostolique See, is more
<PB N="184" REF="117"/>
considerable for strength, then
beauty, however it is in <HI>Italy,</HI>
and therefore <HI>(secundum nos)</HI>
no meane City.</P>
<P>Its scituation is on a plat, so
that by it runnes two Channels,
the one towards <HI>Bolonia,</HI> the o∣ther
towards the <HI>Po,</HI> it is forti∣fied
with very faire Ramparts,
upon most of which are planted
Allies of trees.</P>
<P>Within the Towne are some
faire buildings, as the <HI>Palazzo
del Diamante,</HI> belonging to the
Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> the Castle
where, in the Court are pictur'd
the Dukes of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and tis
said that at the last, there was no
Roome left for another</P>
<P>Before the Pallace are two
small Statues of a Marquis, and
Duke of <HI>Ferrara;</HI> many other
things are observable, as the
Epitaph of the famous Poet
<PB N="185" REF="117"/>
<HI>Ariostus,</HI> and of many other
famous men buried there,
which my short stay would not
admit me to collect.</P>
<P>Our Inne was the <HI>Angelo</HI> (a
too sumptuous edifice to have
been made a Taverne) where
having dind, wee went by boat
downe the Channell, and about
three mile beyond <HI>Ferrara</HI> came
into the <HI>Po,</HI> which is the great∣est
and farthest navigable river
in <HI>Italy,</HI> for breadth and length
much above <HI>Tyber</HI> it selfe; the
ancients cald it <HI>Padus,</HI> the Po∣ets
<HI>Erydanus,</HI> on the Bankes
whereof they feignd that, <HI>Io</HI>
transformd into a heifer was
want to feed.</P>
<P>About evening wee came on
the confines of the <HI>Venetian</HI> ter∣ritoire,
and supt at <HI>Corbua,</HI> a
place three miles distant from
that most ancient, yet now de∣jected
<PB N="186" REF="118"/>
City <HI>Adria,</HI> which for∣merly
gave the name of <HI>Mare
Adriaticum,</HI> to the Sea now cald
the <HI>Golfe of Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Three miles farther, wee
changd our Barke for a bigger
Vessell, to carrie us to <HI>Venice,</HI>
and having now past thirty
miles on the <HI>Po,</HI> we came sud∣denly
by an artificiall cut into
the River <HI>Adice (Athesis in La∣tin)</HI>
that passeth by <HI>Verona;</HI>
and the next morning, about
the opening of the day, wee
enterd into the Golfe, pas∣sing
by <HI>Chioza,</HI> a City in an
Island on the left, <HI>Palestina</HI> on
the right, with other Islands
that lay rang'd in a row to <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>
it selfe, where, wee arriv'd
the twelfth of <HI>September;</HI> and
being come to the Port, wee
(as the custome and order is)
were not permitted to set foot
<PB N="187" REF="118"/>
on shoare, on paine of death,
till wee had a ticket of licence.</P>
<P><HI>Venetia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Venice.</NOTE> is a word never heard
of in the Romans dayes, the
originall of this name being not
above thirteen Centuries of
yeares since, yet Historians ge∣nerally
report, that at the de∣cay
of the Roman Empire,
when the invasion of the <HI>Hunns</HI>
and other Barbarous Nations
overspread <HI>Italy;</HI> Some provi∣dent
Fishermen began to build
Cottages in those scatterd I∣slands,
and in processe of time,
others for their better security
retyr'd thither: From this
poore, and low beginning (imi∣tating
her elder sister) is shee
growne to that height, that all
deservedly call her <HI>Venice</HI> the
rich.</P>
<P>This very mirrour of State
and Policy, as shee was borne
<PB N="188" REF="119"/>
about the death of old <HI>Rome,</HI> so
shee seemes ro bee hereditarily
Possessour of that which main∣taind
<HI>Rome</HI> in her soveraigne
glory; The magnificent Genius
of the People, the Gravity of
the Senate, the solidity of her
lawes, very much consonant
with those of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Hence <HI>Venice</HI> hath this pro∣priety
above all other States;
that she is a Virgin, (a cōmodi∣ty
rarely found within her self)
and more, from her first Infan∣cy,
Christian: having never yet
fell from her principles, either
in Government, or Religion;
but still valiantly defending her
Liberty against the insulting
<HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the wise and Judici∣ous

<P>Environd with her embracing

<P>Hereupon our <HI>English Marti∣all</HI>
admiring the scituation of
the Magnificent <HI>Venetians</HI> City,
sayes to them</P>
<Q><L>Quid mirum est vestram consi∣stere

<L>No wonder if by Lawes your

to your Commands.</L></Q>
<P>If some casuall necessity did
not constraine men to build <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="120"/>
I could never conceive
how so stately Pallaces, how so
compacted a City should stand
in the midst of the Sea.</P>
<P>The particularities whereof
are these. I may begin with the
<HI>Piazza San Marco,</HI> the Center
whither an infinite number of
Persons, from divers parts of
the world in diverse habits;
still tend: The Platforme there∣of
somewhat resembles a Car∣penters
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
square, the
uniformity in the
buildings, and other
embellishments, speaking it the
fairest in <HI>Italy,</HI> I thinke I may
say in Christendome.</P>
<P>At the end just before the
<HI>Chiesa San Marco,</HI> are three
Standards with Pedestalls of
Brasse, very exquisite worke.</P>
<P>At the right side from these,
is the Clock-house, adorn'd
<PB N="191" REF="120"/>
with the signes of Heaven, with
the Sunne and Moones moneth∣ly
entrance to them, and two
Statues of Brasse that strike.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Marks Church</HI> is not
so admirable for vastenesse, as
for the rarenesse of the designe,
and precious materialls it is
compos'd of.</P>
<P>The whole facade, or Fron∣tispiece,
is beset with Pillars, of
Serpentine and Porphyre, to∣wards
the top stand foure horse
of Brasse, most worthy Tro∣phees,
taken (as some say) by a
Stratageme, out of <HI>Constantino∣ple.</HI>
And first stood in an Arch-Triumphall
at <HI>Rome.</HI> Amongst
the imagiry worke on this
Church, there stands a woman
stroking a Dog; The Venetian
Annals mention the story, of
a Senators Daughter, who
(her Father altogether, de∣priving
<PB N="192" REF="121"/>
her of society with
men) had a prodigious Birth
by that over familiar Play-fel∣low.</P>
<P>For the inward part of this
Temple, It is a little obscure
within, yet most richly wenes∣coted
with Marbles, and the
whole top coverd with lively
pieces in Mosaick worke: An
Art lost or unknowne in these
parts, and highly valued there.</P>
<P>Neere that Church gate, that
lookes into the Sea, is a little
Chappell, and therein is an ill
hewd image of the Lady, made
(as their Tradition goes) out
of the same rocke, which <HI>Moses</HI>
strooke when the water mira∣culously
gushed forth; And to
make good this story, they
shew three little holes out of
which the Fountaine came
forth. Some probability there
<PB N="193" REF="121"/>
may be of this, an old and now
scarce legible Greeke Inscripti∣on,
on the same stone beginneth
thus—</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>And underneath these Latine
words,</P>
<P>Aqua quae prius ex petra mi∣raculosè
fluxit oratione Prophe∣tae
Moysis, producta est, nunc
autem haec Michaelis studio labi∣tur,
quem servas Christe &amp;
Conjugem Irenem.</P>
<P>The construction is dubious
the lines verbatim, as there I
found them.</P>
<P>In this same Church is kept
with great reverence, the body
of the Cities Protectour <HI>Saint
Marke,</HI> whose winged Lion with
the Motto, <HI>Pax tibi Marce E∣vangelista
<PB N="194" REF="122"/>
meus,</HI> is the Banner
and Armes of this Common∣wealth,
In honour of this Saint,
here is likewise conservd a most
inestimable treasure.</P>
<P>To this Cathedrall Church
joynes the Dukes Pallace whol∣ly
of Marble, with a Kingly
Arcade of three and thirty Pil∣lars,
under which, tis a most
comely sight to see the <HI>Veneti∣ans</HI>
in their long Gownes, daily
consulting of State affaires.</P>
<P>Just against the great Gate, at
the top of the steps, stand two
<HI>Colosses,</HI> the one of <HI>Mars,</HI> the
other of <HI>Neptune,</HI> works of fa∣mous
<HI>Sansovinus.</HI> Opposite to
these staires is a Facade of Sta∣tues,
both ancient and mo∣derne.</P>
<P>Above is a most royall <HI>Cor∣ridor;</HI>
wherein are divers Tri∣bunalls,
or Courts of Justice,
<PB N="195" REF="122"/>
and higher are most gallant as∣cents
into the Senate house, and
other sumptuous Halls.</P>
<P>Below in the Court, in going
out, I observd the mouthes of
two Wells in Brasse, of very sin∣gular
art.</P>
<P>On the other side of the place
is the <HI>Zecca,</HI> where they coine
money, and the <HI>Procuratorio;</HI>
on the top of this structure
stand five and twentie Sta∣tues.</P>
<P>On the seventeenth of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
whilst wee were at <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI>
there was a new made
<HI>Procurator,</HI> (the second man in
the Republick) enterd into his
office, at which solemnity wee
saw the Senatours in their robes
of Scarlet, Damaske, three hun∣dred
most grave, proper per∣sons,
every one speaking him∣selfe
no lesse then an Embassa∣dour
<PB N="196" REF="123"/>
in his deportment.</P>
<P>The following morning, the
Secretarie of the State, of the
Family of the <HI>Tommasini,</HI> for
appearing a favourite to some
<HI>Banditas,</HI> was privately strang∣led,
and his body afterwards
hung up in the place of execu∣tion,
which place brings mee
againe into my description, it
being Between the two Pillars
that stand towards the <HI>Canale
della Giudeca.</HI> These two Co∣lomnes
were brought out of
<HI>Greece,</HI> on the one stands the
Statue of <HI>Sanct. Theodorus,</HI> with
the Crocodile, on the other
<HI>Saint Markes</HI> Lion of Brasse.</P>
<P>This is the summe of what is
to be noted within, and about
the <HI>Piazza San Marco,</HI> yet be∣fore
I leave it, tis worth the
paines to get up <HI>Saint Marks</HI>
steeple, which stands by it selfe,
<PB N="197" REF="123"/>
eightie feet distant from the
Church.</P>
<P>From thence one may dis∣cerne
how the City lies compa∣cted
of many little Islands,
separated by Channells, joy∣ned
by Bridges, the number
whereof, if well reckoned up,
comes to foure hundred and fif∣ty,
and the greater part of stone.
The fairest and most remark∣able
is the Bridge of <HI>Rialto,</HI>
which, though but of one Arch,
yet for the height, length, and
breadth, hath no where a pa∣rell.</P>
<P>Upon it stand twelve shops,
at each side coverd all alike
with lead, and behind magni∣ficent
<HI>Balustrades.</HI> This Bridge
passeth over the <HI>Canal Grande,</HI>
along which are the most state∣ly
houses in all <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>It is a most satisfactory
<PB N="198" REF="124"/>
sight to behold the <HI>Corso</HI> in this
Channell, every Feast towards
the Evening, to see the <HI>Ve∣netian</HI>
Ladies habited like
Nymphs, and the <HI>Gondola's</HI>
like so many Daulphines run∣ning
a race. These <HI>Gondolas</HI>
are Boats, which because of
the little use of walking a foot
there, are still carrying some
passenger one way or another.
Every noble <HI>Venetian</HI> keeps
one of these Seacoaches for his
family, and others there are to
be hir'd by any man for mo∣ney
very genteel and commodi∣ous.</P>
<P>Hence one may easily conje∣cture
how populate <HI>Venice</HI> is;
for the number of <HI>Gondolas</HI> is
40000. so that in case of neces∣sity;
the Boatmen would make
a considerable army, for every
<HI>Gondola</HI> hath a Rower, and the
<PB N="199" REF="124"/>
better sort too. And now I am
on the water, before I set foot to
land, I may visite some of the
neigbouring Islands, and first
<HI>Murano</HI> a mile distant from <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI></P>
<P>Here continually (excepting
in <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September)</HI> are
Fornaces to make Glasses,
which for the variety of the
worke, and the Chrystall sub∣stance,
exceed all others in the
world, and are transported to
all parts: out of which mer∣chandise
<HI>Venice</HI> drawes infinite
summes of money.</P>
<P>In returning wee stept into
the <HI>Arsenall,</HI> The Magazine and
store-house of Warre, <HI>Mars</HI>
his warehouse. In this place the
Republick hath all ammuniti∣on
for Sea and Land, all instru∣ments
of offence and Defence,
all preparations for shipping so
<PB N="200" REF="125"/>
ready, that tis said they can
raise a Gally in foure and twen∣ty
houres, and though the late
approach of their common ene∣my
the <HI>Turke,</HI> hath much im∣poverisht
this <HI>Arsenal,</HI> yet the
daily labours of Artisans that
worke there, still restore it.</P>
<P>The next day wee went to
the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, where at
their service in their owne
tongue, there was a great Con∣gregation,
who us'd more Ce∣remonies,
but lesse superstiti∣on
then the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
which calls the <HI>Greeks</HI> Schis∣maticks
onely, because they
differ not much in exteriours
from them; but will not ac∣knowledge
the Pope to bee
head of the Church.</P>
<P>Neither have the Orientall
Christians alone this Liberty at
<HI>Venice,</HI> but <HI>Loyalas</HI> Sonnes be∣ing
<PB N="201" REF="125"/>
exild thence, the Inquisiti∣on
reacheth not so far as stran∣gers,
which made us <HI>Hereticks</HI>
(as they call us) thinke wee
were come out of the Land of
Bondage, to a more secure
Country.</P>
<P>The day following wee made
a <HI>Gondola</HI> carry us over to <HI>San
Georgeo,</HI> an Island with a most
beautifull Monastery; The
Chappell is pav'd (as generally
they are in <HI>Venice)</HI> with a red∣dish
Marble, About the Coire
are very rare Statues, and in the
Cloister, sits <HI>Venice Triumphant.</HI></P>
<P>From thence wee went to
<HI>San Giovanni e Paulo,</HI> more in
devotion to the living Ladies,
then to the dead Image there
worshipt.</P>
<P>This Place is much frequent¦ed
by the <HI>Venetian</HI> walking
May Poles, I meane the women,
<PB N="202" REF="126"/>
which gives mee occasion to
speake of the common habits or
fashions of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>The Citizens rich and poore
follow all the same Mode, <HI>viz:</HI>
A long black gowne with wide
sleeves, and a kinde of skirt to
throw over one shoulder, the
collar alwayes open, and a
Black Cap edg'd with Fringe of
Wooll.</P>
<P>The Ladies have found out a
devise very different from all o∣ther
<HI>Europaeian</HI> Dresses. They
weare their owne, or a counter∣feit
Haire below the shoulders,
trim'd with gemmes, and Flow∣ers
their Coats halfe too long for
their bodies, being mounted
on their <HI>Chippeens,</HI> (which are
as high as a mans leg) they
walke between two handmaids,
majestickly deliberating of e∣very
step they take.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="126"/>
This fashion was invented,
and appropriated to the noble
<HI>Venetians</HI> wives, to bee con∣stant
to distinguish them from
the Courtesans, who goe co∣verd
in a vaile of white Taffe∣ty.
These fashions, because they
are not so variable as ours, I
have here inserted.</P>
<P>Before the Church I last men∣tioned,
<HI>San Giovannie Paulo</HI> is
a <HI>Cavalier,</HI> or horseman in
Brasse, with these words.</P>
<P>Bartholomeo Coleono Bergo∣mensi

&amp; Marino Venereo Curatoribus
An: Sal: <HI>Mcccclxxxxv.</HI></P>
<P>This is the chiefe of what I
observ'd in three weeks resi∣dence
at <HI>Venice.</HI> As concerning
the trade, or traffique of this
City, shee is without Doubt,
Mistris of all others; it is shee
<PB N="204" REF="127"/>
that makes rise or fall the Ex∣change
at her pleasure.</P>
<P>And this I imagine proceeds
from the great and innumerable
company of <HI>Jewes,</HI> that are har∣bourd
here, and that enjoy the
Priviledge of a Synagogue for
every Nation; so that in their
<HI>Guetta</HI> they have nine diverse
ones, yet weare they a Badge of
distinction, <HI>viz:</HI> a Scarlet hat.
The shops at <HI>Venice</HI> are most
richly furnisht with Easterne
Merchandize, as Sattins, Da∣masks,
Cloaths of Gold, with
a world of costly Drugs, which
word intimates I must hasten to
the Medicinall <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Padua,</HI> be∣cause
of the convenient passage
by water, is one easie dayes jour∣ney.</P>
<P>About five miles from <HI>Venice</HI>
wee came to <HI>Liza Fusina,</HI> where
<PB N="205" REF="127"/>
the continent or firme Land
beginnes, here one finds com∣modity
of going either by Land
or Boate, wee tooke the latter;
a most delightfull <HI>Spasso</HI> on the
river <HI>Brenta,</HI> which runnes in
so direct a line, that one may
see its course foure miles be∣hind
or before one, on both
sides is a garden-like countrey,
and a multitude of <HI>Villa's,</HI> or
Countrey houses, with Gar∣dens
of Orange trees, and o∣ther
greens after the Italian
way. At the close of the even∣ing
wee arriv'd at <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Patavium</HI> was founded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Padua.</NOTE> long
before <HI>Romulus</HI> suckt the
Wolfe, Tis reported that <HI>Ante∣nor</HI>
flying with some force into
these parts, after the destru∣ction
of <HI>Troy</HI> began this name
and city; to confirme this, they
yet shew this Noble Heros
<PB N="206" REF="128"/>
Tombe, with this Epitaph in
old Characters.</P>
<P>Inclitus Antenor Pat: <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The words are these.</P>

<P>Not farre from this Marble
Chest, are some remnants of the
walls that <HI>Antenor</HI> laid; For
the city is divided into the old,
and the new, the old hath round
about it the river, both are en∣compast
<PB N="208" REF="129"/>
with strong Bull∣warkes,
upon which are plant∣ed
rowes of trees, very plea∣sant
to walke amongst, though
they quite hinder the view of
the city a farre off.</P>
<P>Neither indeed (I must con∣fesse)
doth <HI>Padua</HI> abound with
stately houses, like the other
chiefe Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> yet those
renowned disciples of <HI>Aescula∣pius</HI>
that are nourisht there,
make it to be said both at home
and abroad, <HI>Padua the Learn∣ed.</HI></P>
<P>It stands in a most delicious
and fertile Plaine, which pro∣duceth
so great abundance of
things necessary to humane life;
that the vulgar Proverb goes
<HI>Bolonia la grassa ma Padoua la
passa.</HI></P>
<P>By reason of this plenty of
provisions, and the daily pra∣ctise
<PB N="209" REF="129"/>
in Physick, and the other
liberall Arts this city is no lesse
frequented by strangers, then
<HI>Athens</HI> anciently was.</P>
<P>And indeed those who have
been students at <HI>Padua,</HI> have
reason to commend the place,
for by the Senate of <HI>Venice's</HI>
constitution (under whom <HI>Pa∣dua</HI>
is) every Nation, <HI>English,
Dutch, &amp;c.</HI> hath a <HI>Consul,</HI> en∣joyes
many Priviledges, and by
their matriculation may lay in
provisions, without paying any
excise or taxation.</P>
<P>This liberty is very preva∣lent
to draw Forreigners thi∣ther,
yet the ill Government
of the Schollars there much dis∣swades
others from likeing the
place.</P>
<P>It is strange to finde <HI>Minerva</HI>
so joynd with <HI>Mars,</HI> to see stu∣dents
in so warlike a posture, for
<PB N="210" REF="130"/>
the common mode of the
Schollars is to goe arm'd with a
paire of Pistolls, and a <HI>Stilletto</HI>
by his side, this they say pro∣ceeds
from some old and inbred
dissentions between the <HI>Vicen∣tines</HI>
and <HI>Brescians,</HI> which two
parties so fill the towne with
slaughter, that no man can
walke the streets late at night
for fear of their <HI>Chi-va li?</HI> and
which is a more manifest signe
of their Barbarismes on the
Pillars of the Porch, or Arches
that runne before the houses of
this city, one may discerne
where Bullet have past; nay, so
triviall is homicide amongst
them that if at any time they
want a body for the <HI>Anatomy</HI>
Lecture, they make it a small bu∣sines
to kil a poore <HI>fachin,</HI> or <HI>por∣ter</HI>
to put his body to that use.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these grosse
<PB N="211" REF="130"/>
abuses, yet <HI>Padua</HI> is a very wor∣thy
University. It was Vacati∣on
time when wee were there,
however wee stept into the

<P>Over the Gate is the Lion

<P>Above is the Anotomick

<P>Not farre from the Physick
Schooles is the <HI>Palagio della Ra∣gione,</HI>

considered as an upper Roome
is the fairest and most spacious
in Christendome. Some impose
more on the excellency of this

One day walking to some of
those places, I espi'd a good faire
Chappell put to no better use
then a Barne, asking the reason,
twas told me it had been a Jesu∣ites
Church; an argument that
those Religious States-men are
not welcome where the <HI>Veneti∣ans</HI>
sway the sword; neither in∣deed
have the <HI>Loyalists</HI> one
Colledge in the <HI>Venetian</HI> Cities.</P>
<P>As for the Churches of <HI>Padua,</HI>
that of <HI>Saint Anthony</HI> deserves
the first place. Before the dore
is a Man and Horse of Brasse,
within is a most precious Altar,
under which lies the body of <HI>S.
Anthony,</HI> about is his life and
miracles in figures of Mar∣ble,
cut by the most famous
Masters of those times, or (I
thinke) that ever were, or will
be.</P>
<P>Hard by this Church is <HI>Il prato
<PB N="218" REF="134"/>
della Valle</HI> a Medow, at the end
whereof stands that most weal∣thy
and Kingly Convent of <HI>S.
Justine,</HI> the best and stateliest I
can remember I sawin <HI>Italy.</HI> The
Chappell is an incomparable
piece.</P>
<P>In the Cloysters an Antiqua∣ry
might spend a yeares study;
for amongst the Legend stories
design'd on the walls, they have
inserted hundreds of old In∣scriptions,
with the Draughts of
old stones, and pieces of Urnes,
all which were dug up out of
the ground, when the Founda∣tions
of this Convent were first
laid</P>
<P>A little farther is the Physick
Garden, fild with simples, but
the <HI>Euganean</HI> Hills furnish <HI>Padua</HI>
more abundantly with medeci∣nall
Herbes.</P>
<P>These hills are in view from
<PB N="219" REF="134"/>
<HI>Padua,</HI> and have been alwayes
famous for the Medecinall
Bathes, that proceed from them.</P>
<P>Having spent a week in <HI>Pa∣dua,</HI>
the Gentlemen wee left at
<HI>Venice,</HI> came thither <HI>(viz:</HI> Sir
<HI>J. G.</HI> a Northerne Baronet, and
my Lord <HI>B.</HI> his eldest Son) with
whom wee joynd company to
goe thorough <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and so
over the <HI>Alpes</HI> into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Padua</HI> we hird a Coach
to <HI>Verona;</HI> In our first dayes
journey we had nothing to ob∣serve
but the Fertility and plea∣santnesse
of the Country, nei¦ther
could I imagine my selfe a∣ny
where but in <HI>Lombardy.</HI></P>
<P>Had not the People, Lan∣guage,
Manners, seemd <HI>Italian,</HI>
I might have thought my selfe
to have been out of <HI>Italy;</HI> so
great an alteration is there in
the Landskip betwixt this, and
<PB N="220" REF="135"/>
the other side of the <HI>Appenines.</HI></P>
<P>The meliority of either I dis∣pute

good, yet contrary, that moun∣tanous,
this flat. The latter is
cald <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and under that
name is comprehended the
whole plaine betwixt the <HI>Alpes,</HI>
and the <HI>Appenines.</HI></P>
<P>It was almost Vintage time
when wee past through this Pa∣radise,
and it made my journey
much easier, to see the trees
rangd in order so farre as one
can see, to looke on the Vines
embracing the Elmes, with such
an incredible quantity of grapes,
that they are coverd more with
Purple, then green.</P>
<Q>Et Tellus Bacchi pondere pressa

<P>Besides this wee lodgd every
night in some memorable City,
where wee sound good accom∣modation,
<PB N="221" REF="135"/>
and something ob∣servable.</P>
<P>The first day some houres be∣fore
it grew darke, we were in
<HI>Vicenza.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vicenza,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vicenza.</NOTE> in Latine <HI>Vicentia,</HI>
was according to <HI>Livie</HI> built by
the <HI>Galli Senones</HI> in the Reigne
of <HI>Tarquinius Priscus,</HI> since that
time it hath without doubt suf∣ferd
many changes.</P>
<P>It is now under the <HI>Venetians,</HI>
and stands in the <HI>Marquisate of
Treves.</HI> It is neither fortified, nor
capable of Fortification, it being
situated at the bottome of a hill
that commands the Towne,
however the fidelity of the In∣habitants
keep it in safety.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vicentins</HI> delight to goe
abroad in the world, to see for∣reigne
customes (an humour sel∣dome
found in other <HI>Italians)</HI>
so that at their returne home
<PB N="222" REF="136"/>
they live splendidly, goe richly
appareld, keep many followers;
for which cause this city is repu¦ted
very full of Gentry, &amp; those
rich, the common title to a
Gentleman here being <HI>Signor
Conte,</HI> as much as my Lord.</P>
<P>Neither are they lesse noble
in their Buildings then in their
Garbe; for by the art of <HI>Palladi∣us,</HI>
the late Reviver of the Ro∣man
Architecture a <HI>Vicentin,</HI>
this city is beautified with state∣ly
Pallaces publick, and private.</P>
<P>The Hall of Justice is admi∣rable,
both for the Ancient and
moderne structure, the Tower
lofty, the <HI>Piazza</HI> most capaci∣ous
of Turnaments, and other
assemblyes of the Gentry, Who
are much given to shewes and
Pastimes; and to this purpose
they have erected a Theatre, the
figure whereof I conceive to bee
<PB N="223" REF="136"/>
like those of the ancienr <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
though the materialls dif∣fer,
<HI>Palladius</HI> was the Inventor,
as this Inscription over the
stage, testifieth.</P>

<P>It will hold five thousand
persons, the Scene is very well
contrived with Statues, and

<P>Diverse like places of recrea∣tion
there are, within and about
the City, amongst which is the
<HI>Campo Marzo</HI> made in imitati∣on
of that, anciently at <HI>Rome,</HI>
for to exercise the youth in
Chevalry, thither the Ladies
<PB N="224" REF="137"/>
and Gallentry of the City re∣sort,
in the sommer Evenings to
take the Aire.</P>
<P>The Arch or entrance into
this Field will stand as a perpe∣tuall
monument of <HI>Palladius</HI>
that built it.</P>
<P>Just opposite is the Garden
of <HI>Connt Valmarana,</HI> wherein
the close Walke of <HI>Citron</HI> and

the <HI>Labyrinthe</HI> are things very
commendable.</P>
<P>Going forth at the gate <HI>di

of <HI>Palladius,</HI> with a most high

<HI>Madonna Del Monte.</HI></P>
<P>Halfe a mile farther by the
river side (which river was in

the <HI>Rotonda</HI> of <HI>Conte Mario
Capra</HI> so cald from the <HI>Cupola</HI>
at the top, or likenesse it hath
<PB N="225" REF="137"/>
with the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI>
though in my opinion it more
resembles the Temple of <HI>Janus
Quadrifrons,</HI> for it hath foure

<P>The Master of this house
uses all strangers very civilly.
His Sellars are the best, and the

is he sparing of his Wines
to Travellers; As wee were re∣turning
from this house to our
Inne, wee met with him and his
followers attending him, one of
them who spake French sayd,
his Master desir'd to see us at his
house to morrow, but our short
stay would not permit us to ac∣cept
of that kind invitation, I in∣fer
<PB N="226" REF="138"/>
this passage to shew the ge∣nerous
Minds of the <HI>Vicentines.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning wee left
<HI>Vicenza</HI> very early, dind at <HI>Oste∣ria
Nuova</HI> the midway: And
about foure in the afternoone
wee came unto <HI>Verona.</HI></P>
<P>Tis the vulgar Criticisme on
this Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verona.</NOTE> that if it bee sylla∣bizd,
it comprehends the first
letters of the three head Cities
of <HI>Italy Ve-Venetia. Ro-Roma.
Na—Napoli.</HI> Others leave
the verball dirivation, and more
strictly interpret it, that what∣soever
is containd in those three
Cities may bee found in <HI>Vero∣na.</HI></P>
<P>Her wealth may be compar'd

<P><PB N="227" REF="138"/>
Thus much I must needs say,
were I to see <HI>Italy</HI> againe, I
should make my Station at <HI>Ve∣rona,</HI>
for I know no place more
agreeable or commodious for a
stranger.</P>
<P>The City stands one part on
the side, the other at the foot
of a hill, behind which is a
continuation of huge Moun∣taines.</P>
<P>Before one side of the City
lies a rich Plat Countrey; Be∣fore
the other a stony Champi∣on,
or Downes, wherein <HI>C.
Marius</HI> gave a totall overthrow
to the <HI>Cimbrians.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Athesis</HI> divideth
the City in the midst. Thus
nature hath adornd Her, nei∣ther
hath art been wanting to
glorifie her, and this one may
collect from the mighty rem∣nants

This noble worke was spoild
of all its ornaments by the Bar∣barous

may easily judge, how betwixt
the Arches and the Columnes
there were statues.</P>
<P>In the circuit of this <HI>Moles</HI>

Arch Triumphall dedicated to
<HI>Marius</HI> for his victory over the
<HI>Cimbrians.</HI></P>
<P>And although this City bee
not now of so great a compasse
as Historians report, it was in
the height of the Roman Em∣pire,
yet the <HI>Venetians</HI> have
with great expence joynd new
Bulwarkes and walls unto the
old, and it is fencd with three
Castles, which make it as well
impregnably strong, as delight∣full.</P>
<P>The buildings of this City are
answerable to the <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="141"/>
The fairest is the Councell
house, upon the roofe where∣of
stand expos'd to the open

<HI>Pliny the Naturall Historio∣graphe,
Vetruvius the Archite∣cture,</HI>
all which men graced
their native <HI>Verona</HI> by their sin∣gular
Vertues.</P>
<P>Besides these, the Learned
<HI>Scaliger</HI> was of <HI>Verona,</HI> for
whose sake and his Family <HI>i

the heart of the city, before the
Inne wee lay at <HI>Il Cavaletto)</HI> a
stately Tombe of Marble, en∣compast
with Iron worke, in the
fashion of a Ladder, which that
name implies.</P>
<P>These things wee saw before
it grew darke at <HI>Verona,</HI> which
wee left the next morning, ha∣ving
renewed our bargaine with
<PB N="233" REF="141"/>
the same Coach that brought
us thither, to carry us to <HI>Milan.</HI></P>
<P>At our going out of the
Towne, I saw a Porphire
Tombe in a Church yarde, twas
told me that a King of the <HI>Goths</HI>
lay buried there. Looking into
the River <HI>Athesis,</HI> I espied a
Bridge of old Roman work, and
some Engines which convey
water out of the river in to the
city by Pipes.</P>
<P>When wee parted from <HI>Vero∣na,</HI>
and indeed through all the
Venetian State, our <HI>Matricu∣lations</HI>
wee had from <HI>Padua</HI> did
us much service, for by that
meanes none of the Guard,
would dare to hinder us as
they usually doe strangers.</P>
<P>Two miles beyond <HI>Verona</HI>
wee past over the Downes, me∣morable
for the Battells of <HI>Mari∣us.</HI>
About noone wee came to
<PB N="234" REF="142"/>
<HI>Cavalli Caschieri,</HI> an Inne two

is a most strong Fort of the <HI>Ve∣netians,</HI>
standing at the Embush∣ment

<P>The greater part of the after∣noone,
wee past by the side of
the Lake, which by the Anci∣ents
ws cald <HI>Benaca.</HI> From <HI>Pes∣chiera</HI>
it extends it selfe towards

Tis very rough and tempestu∣ous,
as <HI>Virgil</HI> saith,</P>

<P>Which I believe proceeds
from its enclosure, between
mountaines which stop up the
winde, yet being fenct so with
Alpes which keep of the Nor∣therne
blasts, and warmd
by the reflection of the Sunne,
<PB N="235" REF="142"/>
those hills produce great store
of Olive, Citron, and Orange
trees.</P>
<P>The Lake abounds with fish,
especially with Troutes, equall
to them of the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI>
which wee tasted of that night
at supper at <HI>Lunato.</HI></P>
<P>In the midst of the <HI>Lago di

stands <HI>Sermonea.</HI></P>
<P>The next day wee had very

runnes Porches, whereby one
may walke drye in rainy wea∣ther.
The <HI>Torre della Pallada</HI> is

<P>There is little observable,

<P>A little farther, having past
the river <HI>Oglio,</HI> we went by <HI>Son∣cino,</HI>

but wee soone were out of it
again, for that night wee lay at
<HI>Crema,</HI> which is under the <HI>Sig∣nory

for the materialls more costly.</P>
<P>Tis all of white Marble, and
about it, are five hundred Sta∣tues

that is now in building is ve∣ry
glorious, especially for the

<P>Next to this I reckon the Ca∣stle
accounted by all Engi∣neers
the fairest, the strongest
Fortification or Citadell in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
They are very cautelous
in letting strangers to see it, to
cast an eye on the outworkes is a

<P>Foure dayes past while wee

the other is through <HI>Valesia</HI>
more delightsome, and short.</P>
<P>Wee meeting opportunely

miles short of <HI>Sesto,</HI> tis very

flat Countrey, like a wall to

part <HI>Italy</HI> from her neighbours
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Thereabouts wee had in full

discerne it about foure
<HI>English</HI> miles to out top the

<HI>Verbanus Lacus)</HI> so cald not
that tis the biggest amongst the

<HI>Ticinus</HI> passeth through it into

<P>All that morning wee had a

<P>Here began the difficulty of

constraind.</P>
<P>From <HI>Marguzzo</HI> wee had
horses to <HI>Duomo,</HI> that fore∣noone

very fruitfull though narrow
valley.</P>
<P>Having dind at <HI>Duomo</HI> wee
changd horse, and so the way
<PB N="249" REF="149"/>
required; being mounted we
presently got two miles higher

hazardous way, and deep Pre∣cipices

to lead an army over the <HI>Alpes

five houres, but presently wee
met with a new People, a new
Phisiognomy, a new genius, a
new Dresse, a new Language.
Yet the first words wee heard,
wee even understood <HI>Com Heyn
Gots name,</HI> and <HI>Got tanke
heir.</HI></P>
<P>These Monticoli are in all
things consonant with the <HI>Swit∣zers</HI>
stout, lusty fellowes, yet
very dull and ignorant.</P>
<P>They weare long Breeches,
and rough Bands, their
tongue is a broken Dutch. That
which they are most commen∣dable
<PB N="251" REF="150"/>
for is their Honesty, a
man may travell over all their
Country with Gold in his hand.
Their women speake more of
the Male then their owne, the
female sex.</P>
<P>Having with much paines,
yet delight, because of the
variety, crouded through
some of the Alpes, wee came
to dinner at <HI>Sampion,</HI> at the top
of the Mountaine, to which
that Village gives the denomi∣nation.</P>
<P>This mount <HI>Sampion</HI> was by
the Latins cald <HI>Mons Sempro∣nius</HI></P>
<P>After dinner we had the har∣dest
part of our journey to passe
over, and then wee were worst
of all provided; the poverty of
the place could not afford us
either Saddles or bridles to our
Jades, yet necessitie drives and
away wee must.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="151"/>
Wee were now at the very top
of the <HI>Alpes;</HI> nothing to bee
seen but snow, which hath laid
there beyond the memory of
man, and as some say ever since
the flood.</P>
<P>There are Poles set up to di∣rect
the way to passengers, yet
in the very path our horses went
so deep that few or none of us
scapt without a fall.</P>
<P>In some parts of the yeare, as
<HI>December, January</HI> and <HI>Februa∣ry</HI>
this mountaine is impassable,
The best time is in <HI>September,
October</HI> or <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>After wee had past over the
snow which was but for foure
mile or thereabouts, wee were
forc't to alight, to crawle down
the steeper part of the Moun∣taine;
When our Guide desird
us to horse againe, it hapned
one unruly Jade broke loose and
<PB N="253" REF="151"/>
ran away. Twas my ill Fortune
to be set upon a Mule, an unta∣mable
headstrong beast, which
seeing the other Horse, a great
way before, ranne headlong up
and downe, and carried the Ri∣der
over such terrible places that
all the company gave mee for
lost: When the horse and
my Mule stayd of themselves
my fellow Travellers, over∣tooke
mee, so that evening wee
reacht to <HI>Briga,</HI> at the bottom of
the <HI>Sampion</HI> which was the end
of our Alpine voyage.</P>
<P>Hereabouts the Rivers, the
<HI>Rhene</HI> and the <HI>Rhosne,</HI> have
their fountaines but neither are
Navigable.</P>
<P>The rest of our way to the
<HI>Lake of Geneva,</HI> was amongst
<HI>Alpes</HI> but not over any. There
running along a rich valley be∣tween
two huge Mountaines.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="152"/>
From <HI>Briga</HI> wee lay the next
night at <HI>Sion (Sedunnm</HI> in La∣tine)
being from <HI>Briga</HI> six <HI>Swit∣zer
mile,</HI> thirty <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sion</HI> is the head City of <HI>Va∣lesia,</HI>
the Bishop hath both the
Spirituall and Temporall Juris∣diction.
From <HI>Sion</HI> wee lay at
<HI>Martigni.</HI> The next morning
wee past by <HI>Saint Mauritz,</HI> a
little farther wee went through
a gate that divideth the <HI>Vallois</HI>
from the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy:</HI>
wee dind at <HI>Montei,</HI> and in the
afternoone wee came to <HI>Bove∣retta,</HI>
and there hir'd a Boate, to
passe by the Lake unto <HI>Geneua.</HI></P>
<P>The Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> hereto∣fore
<HI>Lacus Lemanus</HI> is held to
be the biggest in Christendome,
on one side it hath the <HI>Switz∣ers</HI>
and <HI>France,</HI> on the other
the <HI>Savoyarde,</HI> and at that end
where it looseth it selfe in the
<PB N="255" REF="152"/>
<HI>Rhodanus</HI> stands the City that
christens it <HI>Geneva,</HI> where wee
arrivd the sixteenth of <HI>October:</HI>

<P>For this reason tis suppos'd
<HI>Master Calvin</HI> began to preach
up his Reformation, in this

through any splendour in the

<HEAD>AN
APPENDIX
ON THE
Same Subject.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Or the Readers fuller sa∣tisfaction;
and to leave
no part of this Empresse
of the World undescribed; I
have here annexed a captiulati∣on
of those Places which I ca∣sually
omitted to see, partly
collected from my discourse
with <HI>Italians,</HI> partly from my
converse with forreigne Au∣thors
of this nature.</P>
<P>In my first Digression the Ci∣ty
<PB N="264" REF="157"/>
<HI>Lucas</HI> is most obvious.</P>
<P>This Republickes domini∣ons
lie Promiscuously in those
of the Duke of <HI>Florence's,</HI> and
containe not above two dayes
journey in circuit, yet the vi∣gilancy
of the State under his
Catholike Majesties Protecti∣on,
defends their Liberties a∣gainst
all Opposers.</P>
<P>To maintaine their free∣dome
more powerfully, the <HI>Lu∣chesi</HI>
have reduc't this City to
that strength as few in <HI>Italy</HI> can
equall it.</P>
<P>It stands on a flat some few
miles distant from a Branch of
the <HI>Appenines.</HI></P>
<P>The compasse is but small (as
Places of most hard accesse al∣waies
are) the whole not ex∣ceeding
three mile; which is in∣clos'd
and fenc't with gallant
Walls and eleven Bulwarkes.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="157"/>
There is little observable
within the City except the Pal∣lace,
Counsell-Hall, <HI>Arcenall,</HI>
and in the <HI>Dome</HI> the <HI>Volto San∣to,</HI>
which (pardon the traditi∣on)
was set miraculously on an
Image of our Saviour, carv'd
by <HI>Nicodemus</HI> his Disciple,
whilst the Artist was surmizing
after what forme to expresse
that sacred face.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are very af∣fable
to strangers (as I have
been informd) so that some
chuse to stay there, and their
Language is much consonant
with the <HI>Sanesian.</HI></P>
<P>The Territory of <HI>Luca</HI> by the
Country mans industry, a∣bounds
in fruits, Olives espe∣cially,
which are famous here
with us.</P>
<P>Out of <HI>Luca</HI> towards <HI>Pistoia,</HI>
in the high way there runnes a
<PB N="266" REF="158"/>
Rivolet of salt Water, and
from the same Source (as is
imagind) issue those Renown∣ed
Bathes; to goe to which
from <HI>Luca</HI> one passeth, over
the River <HI>Serchio</HI> upon two
Bridges of admirable Stru∣cture.</P>
<P>Advancing towards <HI>Rome,</HI> tis
worth stepping out of the way
to <HI>Perugia,</HI> and <HI>Orvietta</HI> Both
under the Patrimony of Saint
<HI>Peter.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perugia.</NOTE></P>
<P>The first <HI>Perugia</HI> gives Deno∣mination
to the <HI>Lacus Thrasime∣nus,</HI>
though six miles distant.
Here precisely was fought that
memorable Battell Between
<HI>Hanniball</HI> and the Romans the
latter routed.</P>
<P><HI>Perusia</HI> stands on a high hill,
hath but poore Walls, the Ci∣tadell
well fortified, the Foun∣taine,
the Popes Pallace, and
<PB N="267" REF="158"/>
the Schooles deserve seeing,
yet I heard of nothing more re∣markable
there, then the delici∣ous
muscatelle Wine.</P>
<P><HI>Orvietta</HI> is a great Towne on
a Mountaine too; There is in
this City one most singular Piece
to satisfie Curiosity, and that is
the Well, made so that they
goe down by one side and come
up the other; It hath a hundred
and fifty staires, and seventy
Windowes. The <HI>Dome</HI> is such
as all <HI>Italy</HI> hath few the like,
tis built of <HI>Pietra Teverina,</HI>
and on the Front are most exact
Ouerages of Marble.</P>
<P>In or about <HI>Rome</HI> I know no
place I mist, excepting <HI>Bagnaia</HI>
on this side and <HI>Albano</HI> on the
other; the latter deserves see∣ing,
if not for the Antiquity, yet
for the good Wine; one of the
best sorts in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="159"/>
However <HI>Florus</HI> saith <HI>Alba
Latii Caput</HI> before <HI>Romulus</HI> had
laid his Cities foundation: Be∣sides
the Tombes of <HI>Ascanius,</HI>
and of the three <HI>Horatii</HI> yet
stand there.</P>
<P>There are many Ensignes of
the Romans greatnesse, and
places often cited amongst an∣cient
Writers; As <HI>Canna, Sul∣mo
Ovids</HI> Towne, <HI>Brundusium,</HI>
with many others towards <HI>Ca∣labria,</HI>
but few or none steere
that course.</P>
<P>Those that make the circuit
in <HI>Italy, far il Gyro</HI> as they say
goe to <HI>Venice</HI> by the way of <HI>Lo∣reto.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Loreto</HI> one
passeth by divers Remnants of
Antiquity, as first the ruines of
<HI>Otricoli,</HI> then <HI>Narnia,</HI> which
<HI>Martiall</HI> Describes thus.</P>

<Q><L>Narnia Sulphureo quam Gurgi∣ti

<P>Out of the Towne there are
most huge arches of a Bridge
standing over the River, made
by <HI>Augustus</HI> out of the <HI>Sicam∣brian</HI>
spoyles, the <HI>Reliquiae</HI> de∣clare
it to have been the worke
of some flourishing Empire.</P>
<P>'Tis of Marble, One Arch
though not entire is two hun∣dred
foot broad, a hundred and
fifty high, nor can I thinke
<HI>Martiall</HI> spoke of any other
Bridge in the precedent Epi∣gram,

thus.</P>

<P><PB N="270" REF="160"/>
There comes an Aquiduct in∣to
the City fifteen miles in
length, at the embushment are
three faire Fountaines of
Brasse.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Spoleto</HI> runnes the
River <HI>Clitumnus,</HI> the water
whereof the old Poets feign'd,
made the Oxen that dranke of
it, white, as <HI>Virgill</HI> in his Geor∣gicks</P>

<P>Keeping on the <HI>Via Flaminia</HI>
you come to <HI>Foligni,</HI> of old <HI>Fo∣rum
Flaminii;</HI> some step out
of the way to <HI>Assisa</HI> famous for
the birth of Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> insti∣tutor
of the <HI>Capuchian</HI> Order:
<PB N="271" REF="160"/>
but the nearest is to goe to <HI>Re∣canati</HI>
and so to <HI>Loreto.</HI></P>
<P>Great was <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>E∣phesians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Loreto.</NOTE>
great is the Lady of
<HI>Loreto. Loreto</HI> is of it selfe but
a little Bourg or Village, yet
by the noise it makes through
Christendome, especially in the
Catholike Regions, tis as much
frequented as Saint <HI>Peters</HI>
Chaire. Hee's no zealous Ro∣manist
that hath not made one
pilgrimage thither, or sent some
Offering to the Virgin here a∣dor'd.</P>
<P>The Church is on an Emi∣nence;
In the midst with great
reverence is kept the Cottage or
chamber (as they tell) where
the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> liv'd and con∣ceiv'd
her heavenly Offspring.
The house is environd with a
case of Marble most curiously
workt, their Legend runnes
<PB N="272" REF="161"/>
that this lodging was brought
out of <HI>Palestina</HI> by the Angels,
and plac't here at the <HI>Adriatick</HI>
shoare: Why not at <HI>Rome</HI> I
wonder? To confirme this
story they shew the Window
where the Angell enterd at the
Salutation.</P>
<P>Here is without dispute the
greatest Treasurie in Christen∣dome,
and is daily increast
by new Oblations from Catho¦like
Princes. Which the <HI>Turks</HI>
and other Pyrates well know,
and would make incursions
were the place as weake, as it is
little.</P>
<P>Though little it deserves a
longer survey then my speed
will admit. I passe now towards
<HI>Ravenna,</HI> and first <HI>Ancona</HI> pre∣sents
it selfe to my view.</P>
<P><HI>Ancona</HI> the greatest mariti∣mate

At <HI>Ravenna</HI> tis worth the
paines to step into the Church
of Saint <HI>Apollinary</HI> built by <HI>The∣odorick</HI>
King of the <HI>Gothes.</HI>
There are two rowes of most
noble Columnes brought by
the same King from <HI>Constanti∣nople.</HI></P>
<P>Before the Church of Saint
<HI>Vidal</HI> there are some old Idols of
the Pagans, and in the Convent
is the Sepulcher of <HI>Galla Pla∣cidia.</HI></P>
<P>Hard by are the Ruines of
<HI>Theodoricks</HI> Pallace. In the Ves∣sell
of a Fountaine stands a Sta∣tue
of <HI>Hercules Horarius</HI> the like
not in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dome</HI> of <HI>Ravenna</HI> is ve∣ry
sumptuous. The Tradition
is that, Saint <HI>Apollinary</HI> praying
God would shew some miracu∣lous
signe to whom hee would
commit the Bishoprick of <HI>Ra∣venna,</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="165"/>
at a solemne Conventi¦on,
the Spirit came downe in
the likenesse of a Dove upon
one; the Window whereat the
Dove enterd, they conserve
with great Devotion.</P>
<P>In Saint <HI>Francis</HI> his Convent,
is buried the great <HI>Italian</HI> Poet
<HI>Dante,</HI> with this Epitaph made
by himselfe.</P>
<Q><L>Jura Monarchiae, superos Phle∣getonta
lacusque</L>
<L>Lustrando cecini, volverunt
fata quousque</L>
<L>Sed quia Pars cessit melioribus
Hospita castris.</L>
<L>Actoremque suum petiit feli∣cior
astris.</L>
<L>Hic claudor Danthes patriis

<L>Quem genuit parvi Florentia
mater Amoris.</L></Q>
<P>These are the most conside∣rable
<PB N="282" REF="166"/>
rarities at <HI>Ravenna.</HI></P>
<P>I will now make a speedy cut
through those parts in <HI>Lombar∣dy</HI>
I left out.</P>
<P>Neere to <HI>Padua</HI> is <HI>Arquato,</HI>
where <HI>Petrarch</HI> liv'd and past to
the other life, they shew his
house. On a faire tombe is this
his Epitaph.</P>
<Q><L>Frigida Francisci Lāpis hic te∣ossa
Petrarchae</L>
<L>Suscipe Virgo Parens, animam
sate Virgine parce</L>
<L>Fessaque jam terris coeli requi∣escat
in arce.</L></Q>
<P>These Cities in <HI>Lombardy,</HI> as
<HI>Mantua, Modena, Parma, Tu∣rino,</HI>
the Capitalls of foure
Dukedomes are seldome visited
by strangers; and indeed the
splendour those Princes live at
drownes the rarities of the Ci∣ties,
but I have been so super∣fluous
<PB N="283" REF="166"/>
in curiosities, that I feare
Delight should turne too tedi∣ous
thererefore in brief.</P>
<P><HI>Mantua</HI> stands in the midst
of a Lake, which renders the
place inaccessable.</P>
<P>There are to come to the Ci∣ty
two great Bridges, the one
named <HI>San Georgio,</HI> the other
<HI>Molini.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gradaro</HI> is a very faire Church,
as likewise the Dome, where
there's two excellent Pieces of
the Councells held at <HI>Mantuo.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke hath divers seats
and Pallaces about the City.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Fontana</HI> where in a
hall there are rangd about wild
Boares Heads, that <HI>Vincenzo</HI>
Father of this present Duke
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> killed with his owne
hand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Favorita</HI> and the <HI>Thea,</HI>
and above all the Hall of Gy∣ants,
<PB N="284" REF="167"/>
where by strange and unu∣suall
art, how low soever one
speaks, at the corners tis intelli∣gibly
to be heard, and those in
the midst heare nothing.</P>
<P>The Dukes Pallace is of a
most vast extent, <HI>Virgils</HI> house
is shew'd neere the City, no me∣moriall
but his Statue</P>
<Q><L>—Man tua me genuit.</L></Q>
<P>In the rest of the Cities of
<HI>Lombardy,</HI> there is little should
draw a Traveller out of his way
to bee seen, but the Courts of
their Princes, till he comes to
<HI>Turin</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoys</HI> a∣mongst
the <HI>Alpes</HI> where he may
shut this Booke.</P>
