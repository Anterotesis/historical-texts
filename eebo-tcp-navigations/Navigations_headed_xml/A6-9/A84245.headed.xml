<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE season suiting my de∣sire having found so fit an occasion to send to you, I thought good things be∣ing for the present so well with us, (by Gods blessing, and the valour of our small forces) to give you a true information in what Estate the Kingdome is in at this present.</P>
<P>Many Townes of indifferent strength wee have taken from the Rebells. Namely these,</P>
<P><HI>Drogheda</HI> taken by Captaine <HI>Christopher Lof∣tus</HI> with the losse of twenty five men, the Re∣bells loosing neere three hundred.</P>
<P>Likewise taken by the Lord <HI>More,</HI> who
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>beate the Rebells, and tooke store of Muniti∣on which the Rebells were forced to leave behind them, by reason that the Towne was too hot for them.</P>
<P><HI>VVickloo,</HI> and <HI>Waxford</HI> taken by young <HI>Charles Coote,</HI> sonne to that valiant (and deplo∣red) Commander sir <HI>Charles Coote; Colorane</HI> taken by the Deputy President of <HI>Munster.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo</HI> taken by the Lord <HI>Grandeson,</HI> who in that service was shot through the left thigh, entering a breach.</P>
<P><HI>Clogham</HI> was taken by Captaine <HI>Gibbs, Ma∣nah<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> was taken by sir <HI>Richard Greenevill, Gal∣way</HI> and <HI>Garmaston</HI> having beene besieged long by the Rebells, was releived by the Earle of <HI>Ormond,</HI> Leivtenant Generall of his Majesties Forces. As for <HI>Lymrick,</HI> that was a place which did do much hurt to our proceedings, being so strongly fortified by the Rebells, that though our <HI>English</HI> forces had made many at∣tempts against it, yet they were repulst, and forced to recreate as vanquished.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse so it pleased God to blesse us, that he put it into the heart of Captaine <HI>Bart∣let,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>a Scotch Commander, to frame a project, and to put that project in execution.</P>
<P>For on satterday the 9th. of <HI>August,</HI> the said Captaine <HI>Bartlet</HI> came to my Lord Lievte∣nant Generall, and desired him that he would bee pleased to let him imploy five hundred men, and a troope of horse, in a designe a∣gainst the Castle of <HI>Limrick,</HI> withall promising confidently, that hee would take the Castle, or upon the fayling thereof hee would loose his head, the Lord Lievtenant being loath that a Commander of such worth should en∣gage himselfe in a designe of such probable danger, and improbable to prosper, used much perswasions, desireing him to avert his inten∣tion, since an attempt upon that Castle so strongly fortified must of necessity prove the ruine of him and his Company, withall in∣timating that if hee should receive a defeat by the Rebells, and bee lost in that designe, it would give an occasion of incouragement to the Rebells, and bee a meanes to dishearten the <HI>English,</HI> who were in great want of such noble and well disposed Commanders as himselfe.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P> Notwithstanding all this the said Captaine <HI>Bartlet</HI> would not be perswaded but that hee should take the Castle, which the Lord Leivte∣nant seing, gave way to his desire, withall gi∣ving command that five hundred of the pro∣perest and forewardest men should be assign∣ed for him, and sir <HI>Richard Greenevills</HI> Troope of Horse, which hee having received, marcht presently away from the Army to a little vil∣lage, which they had that day plundered, where hee caused them to search for all the Trouses and habits of the <HI>Irish,</HI> with which he habited one halfe of his men, making them appeare just like <HI>Irish</HI> Kemes, having so done, he out of that part of his men which remain∣ed elected thirty musquetiers which he placed, (being befriended by the darknesse of the night) on the backside of the Castle in a deep ditch, giving them command not to stirre till they see the <HI>Irish</HI> forces out of the Castle. Likewise his troop of horse he placed in a little grove, which was of one side of the Castle, some three Bowes shots off, having thus pla∣ced his men, and giving them directions what they should doe, hee sent out those that were
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>habited like <HI>Irish</HI> men, to walke round the Castle, and to waite till that hee should come up to charge the Castle.</P>
<P>The day appearing Captain <HI>Bartlet</HI> led on his men and beat a feirce <HI>alarum,</HI> which the <HI>Irish</HI> in the Castle seeing, began straight to arme them∣selves, but on the sudden they see the supposed <HI>Irish</HI> come to their rescue, for the disguised <HI>English</HI> seemed to charge Captaine <HI>Bartlet</HI> very fiercely, onely with powder to be shot, after a little time spent in this seemeing combate, the <HI>English</HI> falling down thicke and threefold, lying as if they were dead, and the rest flying, which the Rebells seeing, straight issued out of the Castle, pursuing the <HI>English</HI> that fled, not once noting or medling with those that lay on the ground as dead.</P>
<P>Which the 30. Masquetiers seeing rose, and with all speed seised on the Castle, killing those that were the guard, who were unpro∣vided of defence being overjoyed with their supposed victory.</P>
<P>The Troope of horse clapt in betweene them and the Castle and the supposed dead men rose and charged them cutting them off
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>without mercy, so that they at that time kild above 3. thousand of the Rebells, and tooke many prisoners, not loosing above three men, only some few hurt, this is a reall truth, and the true manner of his taking the Ca∣stle of <HI>Limrick,</HI> for which service he is so admired, that the souldiers are greedy to goe with him upon the most desperate designes.</P>
<P>Thus it pleaseth God to fight for us, and wee doubt not (were the present distractions of <HI>England</HI> once com∣posed) and more ayd sent over, we should quickly re∣duce this Kingdome to its former obedience, and ba∣nish all those blood-thirsty <HI>Papists</HI> out of the Land.</P>
<P>This is the summe of all that hath happened lately, or is worthy my paines or your knowledge.</P>
<P>Onely I desire you in requitall to retaine me the chiefe Heads of your proceedings in <HI>England,</HI> for now <HI>English</HI> newes is as much longed for here, as <HI>Irish</HI> newes was lately in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I received a letter from <HI>Chichester,</HI> which informed me that my Lord Deputies sonne was taken prisoner at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and sent up to the Parliament, pray send me word whether it be true or otherwise.</P>
