<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Hamburg, the <HI>22.</HI> of October, <HI>Stilo veteri. 1630.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The King of Sweden hath already taken diuers good places in Meckelburg, and lyeth now neere Rostock, but the Imperialists are very strong within. The Forces of the said King, which he left at the siege of Colberg, in Pomera∣nia, shew great courage, and are in hope to get the said Towne shortly. There marched lately 8. strong Compa∣nies of Crabats, intending to relieue that place as they were commanded, but comming neere, before they were awares of it, they were so welcommed by the Swedish, that the most part was slaine, and the rest forced to saue themselues by flight.</P>
<P>The Imperiall Forces doe much encrease about the Country of Magdenburg, whereby the Administrators his Troopes are no more at such liberty to run the Country as they were before.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y"/>
And cancerning the Duke <HI>Francis Charles</HI> of Low-Saxony (that was last winter here in London) hauing taken three or foure Townes of no great strength, and inten∣ding to take the Castle at Ratzenburg from the Imperia∣lists that lay in it, he was betrayed by his owne elder Bro∣ther <HI>Augustus,</HI> that was in the same Towne, who letting in secretly at night some Imperiall Forces, caused thereby all his Brothers men to be taken and vnarmed, and his brother the said Duke <HI>Francis Charles</HI> endeuouring to saue him∣selfe by flight, went in a Boate vpon the Elb: But the Impe∣rialists hauing planted some Ordnance to hinder the going away of any Boate, gaue fire, and shot off the head of the Dukes Pilote, whereby the Duke was staid, and (as we are informed) taken prisoner, and so carried vp in the Country towards the Emperour. The Imperiallists doe also daily encrease about Stoade, and in the Bishopricke Bremen, where they haue gathered all the Boates, to hinder any body to passe, and themselues haue past ouer the Riuer of Elb about 4000. men, intending (as we are informed) to fortifie and keepe all the passages that are betwixt Lubeck and Hamburg, whereby there is threatned a great dearth in those parts.</P>

<HEAD>From Rome the <HI>14.</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>We learne from Spaine, that the same King hath caused the President of Mantua to vnderstand, that hee must depart thence, for there was no need of his presence any longer. The King also hath sent the West India President into Si∣uil, to see the vnlading of the Siluer Fleet: Some suppose it is by reason of some suspition concerning the distribution: other thinke, because the King intends to reserue the whole for himselfe, by reason of his extreme and vrgent present necessity.</P>

<HEAD>From Millan the <HI>17.</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>It is verified from Constantinople that the Iesuites haue a long time importuned the Grand Lord, to grant a slaugh∣ter, and vtter extirpation of all the Greeke Christians. The same was consented by him the said Great Turke, but there was no prefixed time prescribed for the execution of the same. Wherefore these bloodthirsty wretches were at a certaine time and place assembled together, to resolue when, and how this wicked enterprize should be put in practice. When they were sate in Counsell in this nature; such terrible Thunder-claps, and dreadfull Lightnings fell from Heauen, that their mischieuous intention was there∣by frustrated. The Thunder and Lightning did cast them downe one after another to the very ground, did fire and burne the very Cushions whereon they sate, &amp; put them all into no small perplexity, feare, and astonishment. The Great Turke (who formerly had not willingly condescen∣ded to the cruell and bloody desseine) did openly professe, that he did palpably perceiue that such inhumane cruelty plotted against such innocent harmelesse people, was alto∣gether odious, abominable, &amp; displeasing to the Almighty. Whereupon he consulted what ought to be done to the first brochers and inuentors of such villany; and at last concluded and resolued vpon, That such Miscreants should be punished with <HI>Lex talionis,</HI> that is, be serued with the same sawce. It was so effected: for all those persons, that had a hand in this businesse, as many as could be found out afterwards (being dispersed) were beheaded and put to death.</P>

<P>That which formerly you haue heard concerning the

Maiden, and desire to be resolued therein: it is most cer∣taine and true. The fourth day she lost her speech againe. She then receiued the holy Sacrament, and wept most bit∣terly: afterward she went from one roome and place to another, and did shew with signes vpon her fingers, that she should dye within 14. dayes. Which is verified from Wulffenbuttel to haue falne out according to her demon∣stration. She hath spoken most strange things, inditing and exhorting the people earnestly to serious repentance, to prayer, Christian duties, generally to the seruice and feare of God, for she said that great misery should befall those parts: Insomuch, that betweene Augusto and Galle, in the Country of Brunswick, vpon the Long Wiese, neere vnto Pethmar, should be seene a terrible fight held, that men should goe vp to the very knees in blood. After this should come a great mortality, and at last a peaceable and prosperous yeere. Which things, with many more she spake so elegantly, pathetically, and with such grace, that each one thought she was from her very Childhood brought vp vnto Eloquence; she was of about the age, be∣tweene 17. and 18. yeeres.</P>

<P>It is now certaine that the Prince Elector of Saxony (but without the consent and approbation of his Imperiall Ma∣iestie) doth set himselfe in open Armes, for the defence of his Country. All things here doe foretell and presage no∣thing but fearefull times of Warre and Combustion.</P>

<HEAD>Another from Regenburgh, concerning the resolution of the Prince Elector of Saxony.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas his Imperiall Maiesty, and the Princes of the Dyet haue sent a speedy Messenger againe to the Duke of Saxony, summoning him to appeare himselfe in person, and so to yeeld his verdict and opinion for the resoluing what course to take against the King of Sweden and other Ene∣mies of the Empire, for the establishing and furtherance of the publicke good:</P>
<P>This Messenger is returned backe with Letters to his Imperiall Maiesty from the said Elector, and the Marquis of Brandenburgh, wherein they doe heauily complaine, that Germany within these 12. yeeres is so spoyled and destroyed, the Constitutions of the Empire weakned, the Peeres impouerished and abused, the Liberties suppressed, that iust occasion and cause was offered to forraigne Prin∣ces and Potentates to haue an insight in the affaires of the Empire. Wherefore they for their parts doe desire the a∣bolishing of those Edicts and Proclamations concerning matters of Religion: Otherwise if his Imperiall Maiesty, and the Princes and Peeres of the Dyet and Vnion did not cease treating concerning matters of Religion, that they must not suppose that he and his adherents, and those that are ioyned with him in Religion, will take in hand to de∣fend and ensure them against all forraigne power and inua∣sion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter extract">
<HEAD>From Old-Stattyn the <HI>4.</HI> of October.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding, the Peeres and Inhabitants haue very importunately desired his Maiesty of Sweden to besiege, and labour to incorporate both the passages of Gartz, and Griffenhagen: Their request was thus earnest in this be∣halfe, to the end that the Country might be freed from the excessiue tyranny, burning, and pillaging▪ &amp;c. The reason why his Maiesty hath not yeelded to their desire as yet is,
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
because he hath another weighty Enterprize in hand, to the which end he hath arrested and stayed many Ships, and laden the same with Men, Munition, Victuals, Ordnance, and all necessaries. With this Fleet and Army he sailed very lately hence (the wind being fauourable) he passed by Wolgast, and went to Straelzondt, where he will land his Army, and march to Mechlenburgh.</P>
<P>Before the departure of his Maiesty, came Letters to him from the 6. Electors, which Letters did answer vnto what his Maiesty formerly had written vnto them: whereupon they required his Maiesty to depart the Confines of the Empire, promising that they would vse all meanes possible to obtaine a Peace: But his Maiesty not regarding, but altogether slighting their propositions, did notwithstanding proceed, to prosecute his designe and enterprize, vnto which the Lord giue a blessed successe.</P>
<P>The Imperialists being aduertised of the departure of his Maiesty of Sweden, fell vpon this Citty with all their possible force and might, and vpon the Sconces and other Forts, shouting, and crying, and making a fearefull noyse: but they were so receiued at their comming, that they were commpelled to retire with the losse of many men.</P>
<P>This last weeke past, the Imperialists came with some Forces before Posewaldt, which the King of Swedens For∣ces had taken and besconced but 4. dayes before; they strongly assaulted this place, and at last set the same on fire, insomuch that those within were not able to abide the heate, and therefore not sufficiently defend themselues, in∣somuch that the Imperialists mastered the same, and haue miserably and cruely slaine Souldiers, Citizens, men, wo∣men, and children: they found in the same 14. Peeces of Ordnance, and other good commodities.</P>
<P>By reason that the pestilence raignes hotly in Gartz a∣mong the Emperours Forces, they flye apace out of the Imperiall Army, vnto the Bishop of Hall. The Generall Field-marshall, Count <HI>Torqualto,</HI> the Generall <HI>Cordacke,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
and the Lord <HI>Morando</HI> are all of them lately deceased.</P>
<P>The Boores in Bohemia continue still in their rebellion, and will not agree to any composition, nor be brought vn∣to any reformation. Those that went to oppose and re∣sist them, are returned backe, by reason they found them so strong and well ordered, armed, and vnited together.</P>

<P>The Bishop of Halls Souldiers, as also those of the City Maeghdenburgh commit great insolencies, fly out day and night, fetch all things vnto them by hooke and crooke; Hereupon the Regiment of Generall <HI>Hulikens,</HI> with some other Forces, hath commanded to haue an eye to them. Last Wednesday they encountred with them neere vnto Germers-leuco: on <HI>Hulikens</HI> side was slaine one Captaine, one Lieutenant, one Ritmaster, and diuers o∣ther Officers, amongst the rest one <HI>Ripensteyn,</HI> with many men more.</P>
<P>Those of Maghdenburgh had some men in Ambush, so that they did greatly endamage the Imperialists. The Maeghdenburgers came not off without sustaining great losse. Among those that were slaine on this Bishops side, were found 15. Citizens of Egelen. The Frontiers there∣abouts betake themselues to the Bishops Forces, as also most of the Inhabitants thereabouts, doe flye with all their goods and Moueables into Maeghdenburgh.</P>
<P>The Forces about Wulffenbuttel doe begin to stay the Corne-waggons, which trauell toward Brunswick. Now also comes tydings, that those of Maeghdenburgh haue defeated and slaine the Crabates which were come into Wandsleuen.</P>

<HEAD>From Brunswicke the <HI>4.</HI> of October.</HEAD>
<P>The Imperialists in Wulffenbuttel doe begin to come vpon this City with great threatnings. They conuey away all the Corne which is in this Citty. The Commander himselfe lately came hither, and requires a plaine Catago∣ricall answer, whether or no this Citty is resolued to ad∣uenture body and goods for the Emperour? he demaunds of them an act of assurance of their hand-writing, for con∣firmation of the same. Furthermore, that this Magistracy shall not suffer any Souldiers to be leauied for the Admi∣nistrator and Bishop of Hall. They therefore doe imprison all those Commanders that come hither for that purpose.
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>
For the first point, it is resolued to make knowne the Proposition of the Emperours demaund vnto all Officers and Companies, and all manner of Trades. For the latter we did excuse our selues, insomuch as we could not as yet heare of any Forces were to be leuied.</P>

<P>Our Legate, who was dispatched to the Emperour is not as yet returned, so that we cannot tell whether his Im∣periall Maiesty will vndertake the affaires of this Citty, yea, or no. In the meane time his Maiesty of Denmarke is Master of the Riuer Elue, he suffers all manner of Ships and Barkes to passe to and fro, but those that ascend the Riuer must pay toll, as much as the Hollandish Conuoy doth amount vnto. His Maiesty of Denmarke hath markt the Beacons with his owne marke, and set them vpon the drought. He causeth great paines to be taken about the Blockhouse which is raised in the Hauen S. <HI>Margarita,</HI> betweene the Steur and Gheluckstadt, where he will com∣mand the Riuer Elue. As soone as this worke is ended, his Maiesties great Ships will againe goe downe to Cop∣penhagen. The Magistracy of this Citty finding the char∣ges excessiue and intolerable, haue cashierd most of their Ships and Men; neither will the Commonalty yeeld any more Contribution. It seemes that our (formerly stout) Mariners haue now lost their courage; for a while since, 5. of our Ships fled from two of the Kings Ships, not da∣ring to resist them, or make shot against them. This day came tydings that his Maiesty is gone towards Rensburgh, to what end we doe not yet know.

and 4. or 5. more they tooke in the Maza going from Eng∣land. One Dunkerke among the rest did a notable exploit, he met with one sayling to Nantes with great store of <HI>Aqua vitae.</HI> This Dunkerker proffered to conuoy him thither, being (as he counterfeited) a States Man of War, he put forth a Flag of Rotterdam: hauing sailed with him one whole day, he inuited the Shipper aboord the next day, and feasted him. This Master of the Ship presented vnto the Dunkerke a Rundlet of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and whilest they were making merry together, the Dunkerke tooke him prisoner, and caused him to write to the Pilot for more <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> with the Boat which was full of men. So they tooke occasion to boord the Ship, and brought the same into Dunkerke.</P>
