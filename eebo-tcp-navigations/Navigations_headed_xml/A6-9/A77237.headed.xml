<OPENER><SALUTE>Kind Reader:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Ad I opportunity but to borrow some of the Authors wit, 'tis pos∣sible I might so trim this curious Work with such quaint expressions, as that the Preface might bespeake thy further peru∣sall; but I feare 'twil be a shame for a man that can speak so little, to be seene in the title page of this Womans Book, lest by comparing the one with the other, the Reader should passe his sentence, that it is the gift of wo∣men, not only to speak most, but to speake best; I shall leave therefore to commend that, which with any ingenious Reader will too much commend the Author, unlesse men turne more peevish then women, to envie the excellency of the inseriour Sex. I doubt not but the Reader will quickly finde more then I can say, and the worst effect of his rea∣ding will be unbeleif, which will make him question whether it be a womans Work, and aske, Is it possible? If any doe, take this as an answer from him that dares avow it; It is the VVork of a VVoman, honoured, and e∣steemed
<PB REF="3"/>where she lives, for her gracious de∣meanour, her eminent parts, her pious con∣versation, her courteous disposition, her exact diligence in her place, and discreet mannag∣ing of her family occasions; and more then so, these Poems are the fruit but of some few houres, curtailed from her sleep, and other re∣freshments. I dare adde little, lest I keepe thee too long, if thou wilt not beleeve the worth of these things (in their kind) when a man sayes it, yet beleeve it from a woman when thou seest it. This only I shall annex, I feare the displeasure of no person in the pub∣lishing of these Poems but the Authors, without whose knowledge, and contrary to her expe∣ctation, I have presumed to bring to publick view what she resolved should never in such a manner see the Sun; but I found that di∣vers had gotten some scattered papers, affe∣cted them wel, were likely to have sent forth broken peices to the Authors prejudice, which I thought to prevent, as well as to pleasure those that earnestly desired the view of the whole.</P>

<HEAD>To my deare Sister, the Author of these Poems.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THough most that know me, dare (I think) affirm</L>
<L>I ne're was borne to doe a Poet harm,</L>
<L>Yet when I read your pleasant witty strains,</L>
<L>It wrought so strongly on my addle brames;</L>
<L>That though my verse be not so finely spun,</L>
<L>And so (like yours) cannot so neatly run,</L>
<L>Yet am I willing, with upright intent,</L>
<L>To shew my love without a complement.</L>
<L>There needs no painting to that comely face,</L>
<L>That in its native beauty hath such grace;</L>
<L>What I (poore silly I) prefix therefore,</L>
<L>Can but doe this, make yours admir'd the more;</L>
<L>And if but only this, I doe attaine</L>
<L>Content, that my disgrace may be your gaine.</L>
<L>If women, I with women, may compare,</L>
<L>Your Works are solid, others weake as aire;</L>
<L>Some books of Women <HI>I</HI> have heard of late,</L>
<L>Perused some, so witlesse, intricate,</L>
<L>So void of sence, and truth, as if to erre</L>
<L>Were only wisht (acting above their sphear)</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>And all to get, what (filly soules) they lack,</L>
<L>Esteeme to be the wisest of the pack;</L>
<L>Though (for your sake) to some this be permitted,</L>
<L>To print, yet wish I many better witted;</L>
<L>Their vanity make this to be inquired,</L>
<L>If women are with wit, and sence inspired:</L>
<L>Yet when your Works shall come to publick view,</L>
<L>'Twill be affirm'd, 'twill be confirm'd by you:</L>
<L>And I, when seriously I had revolved</L>
<L>What you had done, I presently resolved,</L>
<L>Theirs was the Persons, not the Sexes failing,</L>
<L>And therefore did be-speak a modest vailing.</L>
<L>You have acutely in <HI>Eliza</HI>'s ditty</L>
<L>Acquitted women, else I might with pitty,</L>
<L>Have wisht them all to womens Works to look,</L>
<L>And never more to meddle with their book.</L>
<L>What you have done, the Sun shall witnesse beare,</L>
<L>That for a womans Worke 'tis very rare;</L>
<L>And if the Nine vouchsafe the Tenth a place,</L>
<L>I think they rightly may yeeld you that grace.</L>
<L>But least I should exceed, and too much love,</L>
<L>Should too too much endear'd affection move,</L>
<L>To super-adde in praises I shall cease,</L>
<L>Least while I please my selfe I should displease</L>
<L>The longing Reader, who may chance complaine,</L>
<L>And so requite my love with deep disdaine;</L>
<L>That I your silly Servant, stand i' th' porch,</L>
<L>Lighting your Sun-light with my blinking torch;</L>
<L>Hindring his minds content, his sweet repose,</L>
<L>Which your delightfull Poems doe disclose,</L>
<L>When once the Caskets op'ned; yet to you</L>
<L>Let this be added, then i'le bid adieu,</L>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>If you shall think, it will be to your shame</L>
<L>To be in print, then I must beare the blame:</L>
<L>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'t be a fault, 'tis mine, 'tis shame that might</L>
<L>Deny so faire an infant of its right,</L>
<L>To looke abroad; I know your modest minde,</L>
<L>How you will blush, complaine, 'tis too unkinde,</L>
<L>To force a womans birth, provoke her paine,</L>
<L>Expose her Labours to the world's disdaine:</L>
<L>I know you'l say, you doe defie that mint,</L>
<L>That stampt you thus, to be a foole in print,</L>
<L>'Tis true, it doth not now so neatly stand,</L>
<L>As ift 'twere pollisht with your owne sweet hand;</L>
<L>'Tis not so richly deckt, so trimly tir'd,</L>
<L>Yet it is such as justly is admir'd.</L>
<L>If it be folly, 'tis of both, or neither,</L>
<L>Both you and I, we'l both be fools together;</L>
<L>And he that sayes, 'tis foolish (if my word</L>
<L>May sway) by my consent shall make the third.</L>
<L>I dare out-face the worlds disdaine for both,</L>
<L>If you alone professe you are not wroth;</L>
<L>Yet if you are, a womans wrath is little,</L>
<L>When thousands else admire you in each tittle.</L>

<L>Of your
<NOTE PLACE="marg">T D. on the four parts of the world</NOTE> sour sisters, deckt in black &amp; white</L>
<L>Of fairer Dames, the sun near saw the face,</L>
<L>(though made a pedestall for <HI>Adams</HI> Race)</L>
<L>Their worth so shines, in those rich lines you show.</L>
<L>Their paralells to find I scarcely know,</L>
<L>To climbe their Climes, I have nor strength, nor skill,</L>
<L>To mount so high, requires an Eagles quill:</L>
<L>Yet view thereof, did cause my thoughts to soare,</L>
<L>My lowly pen, might wait upon those four,</L>
<L>I bring my four; and four, now meanly clad,</L>
<L>To do their homage unto yours most glad,</L>
<L>Who for their age, their worth, and quality,</L>
<L>Might seem of yours to claime precedency;</L>
<L>But by my humble hand thus rudely pen'd</L>
<L>They are your bounden handmaids to attend.</L>
<L>These same are they, of whom we being have,</L>
<L>These are of all, the life, the nurse, the grave,</L>
<L>These are, the hot, the cold, the moist, the dry,</L>
<L>That sinke, that swim, that fill, that upwards flye,</L>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<L>Of these consists, our bodyes, cloathes, and food,</L>
<L>The world, the usefull, hurtfull, and the good:</L>
<L>Sweet harmony they keep, yet jar oft times,</L>
<L>Their discord may appear, by these harsh rimes.</L>
<L>Yours did contest, for Wealth, for Arts, for Age,</L>
<L>My first do shew, their good, and then their rage,</L>
<L>My other four, do intermixed tell</L>
<L>Each others faults, and where themselves excell:</L>
<L>How hot, and dry, contend with moist, and cold,</L>
<L>How Aire, and Earth, no correspondence hold,</L>
<L>And yet in equall tempers, how they gree,</L>
<L>How divers natures, make one unity.</L>
<L>Some thing of all (though mean) I did intend,</L>

<L>I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth,</L>
<L>My goods are true (though poor) I love no stealth,</L>
<L>But if I did, <HI>I</HI> durst not send them you;</L>
<L>Who must reward a theife, but with his due.</L>
<L>I shall not need my innocence to clear,</L>
<L>These ragged lines, will do't, when they appear.</L>
<L>On what they are, your mild aspect I crave,</L>

<L>Whence vomits, wormes, and flux have issued?</L>
<L>What breaches, knocks, and falls I daily have?</L>
<L>And some perhaps, I carry to my grave.</L>
<L>Some times in fire, sometimes in waters fall:</L>
<L>Strangely preserv'd, yet mind it not at all.</L>

<L>This act (me thinks) his god head should ashame,</L>

<L>The Queen <HI>Olimpias,</HI> bears him deadly hate,</L>
<L>(Not suffering her to meddle in the State)</L>

<L>His doing so, no whit displeas'd the King,</L>
<L>Though to his Mother he disprov'd the thing;</L>

<L>So to be caught, <HI>Antipater</HI>'s too wise,</L>

<L>As oft his Acts throughout his reigne did shew:</L>
<L>More boundles in ambition then the skie,</L>
<L>Vain thirsting after immortality:</L>
<L>Still fearing that his Name might hap to die,</L>

<L>This conquerour did oft lament ('tis sed)</L>

<L>A God alive him all must Idolize;</L>

<HEAD>Of the vanity of all worldly creatures.</HEAD>
<L>AS he said vanity, so vain say I,</L>
<L>O vanity, O vain all under skie,</L>
<L>Where is the man can say, lo, I have found</L>
<L>On brittle earth, a consolation sound?</L>
<L>What is 't in honour, to be set on high?</L>
<L>No, they like beasts, and sonnes of men shall die,</L>
<L>And whilst they live, how oft doth turn their State?</L>
<L>He's now a slave, that was a Prince of late.</L>
<L>What is't in wealth, great treasures for to gain?</L>
<L>No, that's but labour anxious, care and pain.</L>
<L>He heaps up riches, and he heaps up sorrow,</L>
<L>Its his to day, but who 's his heire to morrow?</L>
<L>What then? content in pleasures canst thou find?</L>
<L>More vain then all, that's but to grasp the wind.</L>
<L>The sensuall senses for a time they please,</L>
<L>Mean while the conscience rage, who shall appease?</L>
<L>What is't in beauty? no, that's but a snare,</L>
<L>They'r foul enough to day, that once was fair,</L>
<L>What, Is't in flowring youth, or manly age?</L>
<L>The first is prone to vice, the last to rage.</L>
<L>Where is it then? in wisdome, learning, arts?</L>
<L>Sure if on earth, it must be in those parts;</L>
<L>Yet these, the wisest man of men did find,</L>
<L>But vanity, vexation of the mind,</L>
<L>And he that knows the most doth still bemoan,</L>
<L>He knows not all, that here is to be known,</L>
<L>What is it then? to do as Stoicks tell,</L>
<L>Nor laugh, nor weep, let things go ill or well▪</L>

<L>Such stoicks are but stocks, such teaching vain:</L>
<L>While man is man, he shall have ease or pain.</L>
<L>If not in honour, beauty, age, nor treasure,</L>
<L>Nor yet in learning, wisdome, youth nor pleasure?</L>
<L>Where shall I climbe, sound, seek, search or find,</L>
<L>That <HI>summum Bonum</HI> which may stay my mind?</L>
<L>There is a path, no vultures eye hath seen.</L>
<L>Where lions fierce, nor lions whelps hath been,</L>
<L>Which leads unto that living Christall fount,</L>
<L>Who drinks thereof, the world doth naught account.</L>
<L>The depth, and sea, hath said its not in me,</L>
<L>With pearl and gold it shall not valued be:</L>
<L>For <HI>Saphyre, Onix, Topas,</HI> who will change,</L>
<L>Its hid from eyes of men, they count it strange,</L>
<L>Death and destruction, the fame hath heard,</L>
<L>But where, and what it is, from heaven's declar'd,</L>
<L>It brings to honour, which shall not decay,</L>
<L>It steeres with wealth, which time cann't wear away.</L>
<L>It yeeldeth pleasures, faire beyond conceit,</L>
<L>And truly beautifies without deceit.</L>
<L>Nor strength nor wisdome, nor fresh youth shall fade,</L>
<L>Nor death shall see, but are immortall made,</L>
<L>This pearl of price, this tree of life, this spring,</L>
<L>Who is possessed of, shall reign a King.</L>
<L>Nor change of state, nor cares shall ever see,</L>
<L>But wear his Crown unto eternitie,</L>
<L>This satiat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the soul, this stayes the mind,</L>
