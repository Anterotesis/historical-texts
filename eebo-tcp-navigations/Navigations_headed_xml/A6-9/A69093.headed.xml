<L>Our first obseruance, after any absence</L>
<L>Must be presented euer to our Mistresse:</L>
<L>As at our parting she should still be last,</L>
<L><HI>Hinc Amor vt circulus,</HI> from hence tis said</L>
<L>That loue is like a circle, being th'efficient</L>
<L>And end of all our actions; which excited</L>
<L>By no worse abiect then my matchlesse mistresse</L>
<L>Were worthy to employ vs to that likenesse;</L>
<L>And be the onely Ring our powers should beate,</L>
<L>Noble she is by birth, made good by vertue,</L>
<L>Exceeding faire, and her behauiour to it,</L>
<L>Is like a singular Musitian</L>
<L>To a sweete Instrument, or else as doctrine</L>
<L>Is to the soule, that puts it into Act,</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>And prints it full of admirable formes</L>
<L>Without which twere an emptie, idle flame</L>
<L>Her eminent iudgement to dispose these parts,</L>
<L>Sits on her browe and holds a siluer Scepter,</L>
<L>with which she keepes time to the seuerall musiques,</L>
<L>Plac't in the sacred consort of her beauties:</L>
<L>Loues compleat armorie is manadgd in her.</L>
<L>To stirre affection, and the discipline</L>
<L>To checke and to affright it from attempting</L>
<L>Any attaint might disproportion her</L>
<L>Or make her graces lesse then circular;</L>
<L>Yet her euen carriage, is as farre from coynesse</L>
<L>As from Immodestie, in play, in dancing</L>
<L>In suffering court-ship: in requiting kindnesse.</L>
<L>In vse of places, houres, and companies</L>
<L>Free as the Sunne, and nothing more corrupted,</L>
<L>As circumspect as <HI>Cynthia,</HI> in her vowes,</L>

<L>This is her house, what? the gates shut and cleere</L>
<L>Of all attendants? Why, the house was wont</L>
<L>To hold the vsuall concourse of a Court,</L>
<L>And see, me thinks through the encourtaind windowes</L>
<L>(In this high time of day) I see light Tapers,</L>

<LG>
<L>The truth is, <HI>I</HI> haue done your knowne deserts</L>
<L>More wrong, then with your right should let you greet me</L>
<L>And in your absence, which makes worse the wrong,</L>
<L>And in your honour, which still makes it worse.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vand.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>If this be all my Lord, the discontent</L>
<L>You seeme to entertaine, is meerly causlesse:</L>
<L>Your free confession, and the manner of it,</L>
<L>Doth liberally excuse what wrong soeuer,</L>
<L>Your mis-conceit could make you lay on me,</L>

<L>That we may take the spleene, and corsey from it.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vau.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Then heare a strange report and reason, why</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> did you this repented iniurie.</L>
<L>You know my wife is by the rights of courtship,</L>
<L>Your chosen Mistresse, and she not disposde</L>
<L>(As other Ladies are) to entertaine</L>
<L>Peculiar termes, with common acts of kindnesse:</L>
<L>But (knowing in her, more then womens iudgement,</L>
<L>That she should nothing wrong her husbands right,</L>
<L>To vse a friend onely for vertue, chosen</L>
<L>With all the right; of friendship) tooke such care</L>
<L>After the solemne parting to your trauaile,</L>
<L>And spake of you with such exceeding passion,</L>
<L>That <HI>I</HI> grew iealous, and with rage excepted</L>
<L>Against her kindnesse, vtterly forgetting</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> should haue waied so rare a womans words,</L>
<L>As duties of a free and friendly iustice:</L>
<L>Not as the head-strong and incontinent vapors</L>
<L>Of other Ladies bloods, enflamed with lust,</L>
<L>Wherein I iniured both your innocencies,</L>
<L>Which <HI>I</HI> approue, not out of flexible dotage,</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>By any cunning flatteries of my wife,</L>
<L>But in impartiall equitie, made apparant</L>
<L>Both by mine owne well-waid comparison</L>
<L>Of all her other manifest perfections,</L>
<L>With this one onely doubtfull leuitie,</L>
<L>And likewise by her violent apprehension</L>
<L>Of her deepe wrong and yours, for she hath vowde,</L>
<L>Neuer to let the common Pandresse light,</L>
<L>(Or any doome as vulgar) censure her</L>
<L>In any action she leaues subiect to them,</L>
<L>Neuer to fit the day with her attire,</L>
<L>Nor grace it with her presence; Nourish in it,</L>
<L>(Vnlesse with sleepe) nor stir out of her chamber:</L>
<L>And so hath muffled and mewd vp her beauties</L>
<L>In neuer-ceasing darkenesse, Neuer sleeping,</L>
<L>But in the day transform'd by her to night:</L>
<L>With all Sunne banisht from her smootherd graces:</L>
<L>And thus my deare and most vnmatched wife,</L>
<L>That was a comfort and a grace to me,</L>
<L>In euery iudgement, euery companie,</L>
<L>I, by false Iealousie, haue no lesse then lost,</L>
<L>Murtherd her liuing, and emtoomd her quicke.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vand.</SPEAKER>

<L>Conceit it not so deepely, good my Lord,</L>
<L>Your wrong to me or her, was no fit ground</L>
<L>To beare so waightie and resolu'd a vowe,</L>
<L>From her incensed and abused vertues.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Uau.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>There could not be a more important cause,</L>
<L>To fill her with a ceaslesse hate of light,</L>
<L>To see it grace grose lightnesse with full beames,</L>
<L>And frowne on continence with her oblique glances.</L>
<L>As nothing equalls, right to vertue done,</L>
<L>So is her wrong past all comparison.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vand.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Vertue is not malitious, wrong done her</L>
<L>Is righted euer when men grant they Erre,</L>
<L>But doth my princely mistresse so contemne</L>
<L>The glorie of her beauties, and the applause</L>

<L>To let a voluntarie vowe obscure them;</L>
