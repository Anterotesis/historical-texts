<L>Our first obseruance, after any absence</L>
<L>Must be presented euer to our Mistresse:</L>
<L>As at our parting she should still be last,</L>
<L><HI>Hinc Amor vt circulus,</HI> from hence tis said</L>
<L>That loue is like a circle, being th'efficient</L>
<L>And end of all our actions; which excited</L>
<L>By no worse abiect then my matchlesse mistresse</L>
<L>Were worthy to employ vs to that likenesse;</L>
<L>And be the onely Ring our powers should beate,</L>
<L>Noble she is by birth, made good by vertue,</L>
<L>Exceeding faire, and her behauiour to it,</L>
<L>Is like a singular Musitian</L>
<L>To a sweete Instrument, or else as doctrine</L>
<L>Is to the soule, that puts it into Act,</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>And prints it full of admirable formes</L>
<L>Without which twere an emptie, idle flame</L>
<L>Her eminent iudgement to dispose these parts,</L>
<L>Sits on her browe and holds a siluer Scepter,</L>
<L>with which she keepes time to the seuerall musiques,</L>
<L>Plac't in the sacred consort of her beauties:</L>
<L>Loues compleat armorie is manadgd in her.</L>
<L>To stirre affection, and the discipline</L>
<L>To checke and to affright it from attempting</L>
<L>Any attaint might disproportion her</L>
<L>Or make her graces lesse then circular;</L>
<L>Yet her euen carriage, is as farre from coynesse</L>
<L>As from Immodestie, in play, in dancing</L>
<L>In suffering court-ship: in requiting kindnesse.</L>
<L>In vse of places, houres, and companies</L>
<L>Free as the Sunne, and nothing more corrupted,</L>
<L>As circumspect as <HI>Cynthia,</HI> in her vowes,</L>

<L>This is her house, what? the gates shut and cleere</L>

<L>To hold the vsuall concourse of a Court,</L>
<L>And see, me thinks through the encourtaind windowes</L>
<L>(In this high time of day) I see light Tapers,</L>

<L>The truth is, <HI>I</HI> haue done your knowne deserts</L>
<L>More wrong, then with your right should let you greet me</L>

<L>And in your honour, which still makes it worse.</L>

<SPEAKER>Vand.</SPEAKER>

<L>If this be all my Lord, the discontent</L>
<L>You seeme to entertaine, is meerly causlesse:</L>
<L>Your free confession, and the manner of it,</L>
<L>Doth liberally excuse what wrong soeuer,</L>
<L>Your mis-conceit could make you lay on me,</L>

<L>That we may take the spleene, and corsey from it.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vau.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Then heare a strange report and reason, why</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> did you this repented iniurie.</L>
<L>You know my wife is by the rights of courtship,</L>
<L>Your chosen Mistresse, and she not disposde</L>
<L>(As other Ladies are) to entertaine</L>
<L>Peculiar termes, with common acts of kindnesse:</L>
<L>But (knowing in her, more then womens iudgement,</L>
<L>That she should nothing wrong her husbands right,</L>
<L>To vse a friend onely for vertue, chosen</L>
<L>With all the right; of friendship) tooke such care</L>
<L>After the solemne parting to your trauaile,</L>
<L>And spake of you with such exceeding passion,</L>
<L>That <HI>I</HI> grew iealous, and with rage excepted</L>
<L>Against her kindnesse, vtterly forgetting</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> should haue waied so rare a womans words,</L>
<L>As duties of a free and friendly iustice:</L>
<L>Not as the head-strong and incontinent vapors</L>
<L>Of other Ladies bloods, enflamed with lust,</L>
<L>Wherein I iniured both your innocencies,</L>
<L>Which <HI>I</HI> approue, not out of flexible dotage,</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>By any cunning flatteries of my wife,</L>
<L>But in impartiall equitie, made apparant</L>
<L>Both by mine owne well-waid comparison</L>
<L>Of all her other manifest perfections,</L>
<L>With this one onely doubtfull leuitie,</L>
<L>And likewise by her violent apprehension</L>
<L>Of her deepe wrong and yours, for she hath vowde,</L>
<L>Neuer to let the common Pandresse light,</L>
<L>(Or any doome as vulgar) censure her</L>
<L>In any action she leaues subiect to them,</L>
<L>Neuer to fit the day with her attire,</L>
<L>Nor grace it with her presence; Nourish in it,</L>
<L>(Vnlesse with sleepe) nor stir out of her chamber:</L>
<L>And so hath muffled and mewd vp her beauties</L>
<L>In neuer-ceasing darkenesse, Neuer sleeping,</L>
<L>But in the day transform'd by her to night:</L>
<L>With all Sunne banisht from her smootherd graces:</L>
<L>And thus my deare and most vnmatched wife,</L>
<L>That was a comfort and a grace to me,</L>
<L>In euery iudgement, euery companie,</L>
<L>I, by false Iealousie, haue no lesse then lost,</L>
<L>Murtherd her liuing, and emtoomd her quicke.</L>

<L>Conceit it not so deepely, good my Lord,</L>
<L>Your wrong to me or her, was no fit ground</L>

<L>From her incensed and abused vertues.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Uau.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>There could not be a more important cause,</L>
<L>To fill her with a ceaslesse hate of light,</L>
<L>To see it grace grose lightnesse with full beames,</L>
<L>And frowne on continence with her oblique glances.</L>
<L>As nothing equalls, right to vertue done,</L>
<L>So is her wrong past all comparison.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vand.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Vertue is not malitious, wrong done her</L>
<L>Is righted euer when men grant they Erre,</L>
<L>But doth my princely mistresse so contemne</L>
<L>The glorie of her beauties, and the applause</L>

<SP>

<P>Some thinke, my Lord, it hath giuen you adition of pride, and outer euidance.</P>

<P>We beleeue your Lordship.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'ol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I finde no alteration in my selfe in the world, for I am sure I am no wiser then I was, when I was no Lord, nor no more bountifull, nor no more honest; onely in respect of my state, I assume a kinde of State; to receiue Suters now, with the Nodd of Nobilitie; not (as before) with the Cappe of courtesie; the knee of Knighthood: And why knee of Knight‚à£hood, little Witte? there's another Question for your Court Accidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diq.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because Gentlemen, or Yoemen, or Pessantes, or so, receiue Knighthood on their knees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pac.</SPEAKER>
<P>The signification of the Knee of Knighthood in Heraldie an't please your Lordship, is, that Knights are tyed in honour to fight vp to the knees in blood, for the defence of faire Ladyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'ol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Verie good: but if it be so, what honour doe they de‚à£serue, that purchase their Knighthood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Purchase their Knighthood my Lord? Mary I thinke they come truely by't, for they pay well for't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'ol.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cut mee off by the knees, little Witte: but I say, (if you will heare mee) that if they deserue to be Knighted, that purchase their Knighthood with fighting vp to the knee, What doe they deserue, that purchase their Knighthood with fighting aboue the knee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mary my Lord, I say the purchase is good, if the con‚à£ueyance will hold water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'ol.</SPEAKER>
<P>VVhy this is excellent: by heauen twentie poundes annuitie shal not purchase you from my heeles. But foorth now: VVhat is the opinion of the world touching this new Honour of mine? Doe not Fooles enuie it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diq.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my Lord, but wise men wonder at it: you hauing so buried your wisedome heretofore in Tauerns, and Vaulting‚à£houses,
<PB REF="25"/>
that the world could neuer discouer you to be capable of Honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>As though <HI>Achilles</HI> could hide himselfe vnder a Wo‚à£mans clothes: was he not discouered at first? This Honor is like a Woman, or a Crocadile (chuse you whether) it flies them that follow it; and followes them that flie it: For my selfe, how euer my worth, for the time kept his bedd; yet did I euer pro‚à£phecie to my selfe that it would rise, before the Sun-set of my dayes: I did euer dreame, that this head was borne to beare a breadth, this shoulder to support a State, this face to looke bigg, this bodie to beare a presence, these feete were borne to be reuellers, and these Calues were borne to be Courtiers: In a word, I was borne Noble, and I will die Noblie: neither shall my Nobilitie perish with death; after ages shall re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="‚Ä¢"/>ounde the memorie thereof, while the Sunne sets in the East, or the Moone in the West.</P>

S'foote they say followers‚ñ™ are but shadowes, that follow their Lords no longer then the sunshines on them: but I finde it not so: the sunne is set vpon my employ‚à£ment, and yet I cannot shake off my shadowes; my followers grow to my heeles like kibes, I cannot stir out of doores for am.
