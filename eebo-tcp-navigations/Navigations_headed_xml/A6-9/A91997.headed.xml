<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last I acquainted you that a great fire had hap∣pened in this Town; but could not then give you the certain Relation of the harm there done: I shall there∣fore endeavour to give you the more ample satisfaction now: the manner thus. On the seventh instant about two a Clock in the morning (casually by accident) the Fire
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>took in the Town-house, burning all the morning, and indeed most part of the day with great violence, so that notwithstanding all the diligent and industrious care used by the Magistrate for the allaying and quenching the fu∣rious flame, it prevailed so far, that the whole Fabrick of that stately House was burned down to the ground: Yet was it a wonder that it did no more mischief then it did. But the mercy and care of God for the fatherless did ap∣pear, in that all the Deeds for Orphans were saved, as al∣so the Records, and most (if not all) of the Writings of the Bank, with many other Papers belonging to, and concerning particular persons. There were some Jews, who were more diligent about the Fire then was needful, for their diligence was onely a colour to their evil intent, viz. To carry away what they could get, some of them laying hold upon several bags of Duckats of a great va∣lue, they were suspected and followed, and being seized, some of the Gold was found about them: they stand committed to Goale, and will speedily be brought to a tryal, where they shall (no doubt) receive the reward due to so heinous a Crime, and be made exemplary to all such as come (in such cases) rather to steal and carry away, then to help or comfort such as are afflicted. The Magistrates caused the City gates to be shut all that day, and drew the Chains placing Guards about the City in all such places where conveniently they might. Many reports have been raised touching the occasion of this Fire; divers are suspected to be the Authors thereof, but no certainty appeareth of any, but it is conjectured to be done of meer purpose.</P>
<P>There is a vast disparity both in the minds and faces of men here; some wishing peace and amity with England, but that party is inconsiderable; others seek for nothing more then how to vent their rage against the English, yet
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>even these are not at one amongst themselves, but are di∣vided, some aspersing the States for not proceeding with more vigour in their cause, others again endeavouring to excuse them; but all in general are against the English, swearing, that their former Name and Reputation as Ma∣sters and Lords of the Sea must and shall have an end, and that they must not think always to keep possession of that which ought to be free and common to all.</P>
<P>Here is lately come News, That the English Admiral hath been among our Busses in the North, and that he hath seized upon great numbers of them (though not without strong opposition, there having been a sharp dispute for about 3 hours, between the English party and the Durch Men of war that were for their Guard) some say 130 Busses, some say more, besides 4 Men of War, and one sunk; but also that the English have lost 2 Men of War, very gallant Frigats. I cannot aver this for truth, but it passeth currantly here; insomuch that the Bores fearing to be half starved for want of their Fishing, arm them∣selves apace, and grow very desperate, Declaring, <HI>That if their Lords do not provide some speedy remedy in this Case, they will pull them out of their houses headlong, and tear them peece-meal.</HI> So that they dare hardly shew themselvs.</P>
<P>Great is the talk here of Vantrumps return into the Downs again with above 100 sail of lusty stout ships (having sent 70 more towards the North parts to en∣counter with Gen. Blake, and free their Fishermen from him. Mean time he with his Fleet will attend the motion of the English in the Downs, and fall upon, sink, burn and destroy them as he can light on them; as also to keep o∣thers from comming to joyn with them. This all at pre∣sent from</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE hear from Piccardy that the Count de Fuen∣sardagn who is General of the Spanish army, af∣ter many days march is come to Noyen, a Town distant about 22 leagues from hence, which put them all to a great fear, thinking they intended to have besieged it, but it proved otherwise, for they turned aside to a place cal∣led Chauni, where having made their approaches, the Town was compelled to yield at mercy, there was many persons of quality found therein, as the Duke Delbeuf, the chief Marshal Manicamp, and many others; it is thought that since the said General is sate down with his army before Noyon, which he intends to take in with Roy and Mendidier. The 17 instant, the King and all the Court departed from St. Dennis, and went to Penthoise, which is a Town in the road between this City and Roan; it doth not hold true concerning the departing of the Cardinal, he having onely plaid least in sight for a while the better to beguile the Princes and this City, before the Commissioners had audience, where after many words passed, he desired them to come to Penthoise, which having denied, the King moved that they would send to the Parliament, that they may send a greater number of Commissioners, and also the Princes, that they might come to a conference, and seek the means to compose all differences; the Commissioners thus remaining at St. Dennis, as they were desired, sent an expresse to acquaint
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>the Parliament of what had passed, who thereupon orde∣red that they should return without delay; and so make their report to the house: and the next day the Prince of Conde went in person with 800 horse to bring them home, and the Duke of Orleans went also out of this City with many attendants, and met them on the way, and so they came to this City, where all manner of pro∣vision chiefly bread, are still at an excessive rate, the poor people being brought to a very great extremity. The 18 the Parliament being sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, all the Chambers assembled, the Commissioners made a large report of that had pas∣sed at Court, and afterwards they entred upon debate of many great businesses, chiefly of that which concerneth the appointing the Duke of Orleans as Regent or Protect∣our of France during the Kings detention by his mother and the Cardinal, the businesse is not as yet perfected, therefore not passed as was reported. The Spanish army is still in the River of Bourdeaux, their General the Lord Vateuille having fortified Bourg near Bourdeaux, and placed there a strong Garison, and now going for Boarg, to joyn with the Count du Daugnon, that so they may be able to encounter the Kings Fleet, who is daily expec∣ted under the command of the Duke of Vendosm, who is High Admiral of France.</P>
<P>We hear from Bourdeaux, that those that are called of the Elm-house get dayly more authority; being as∣sembled the 7th instant it was resolved, That the four∣teen Officers or Members of Parliament which were ba∣nished and called in again, should again depart the City, That the Jurats and other suspected persons, should be laid hold on, and carried forthwith to prison, and some to be banished during life.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, Here is great hopes of a speedy settlement of these parts, the chiefest of the Gentry tendring their submission to the Commonwealth of England. The dis∣cipline of war is exercised very strictly amongst our sol∣diers to keep them from stragling and plundering. A Court Martial was held in the field near Blair, where many were tried, three or four for Life and Death, but suspended till further proof: Eight received sentence for stragling from their colours, and plundering: One of them to be hanged on such a manner, that he might stand on tip toes, and to receive a lash as every Division of the Regiment passed by, and to have his Ear cut, and to be cashiered the Army; another was sentenced to be hang∣ed by the arm-pits whilest the Regiment marched by; A third to be tied to a tree, and to receive thirty stripes. Here is little News concerning General Blake and his na∣vy, onely that he hath taken many Busses, and one or two Men of War that were for a Guard to them; some of them he hath sent towards Dunbar, where in short space (we do not doubt) but they will well and safely ar∣rive.</P>
