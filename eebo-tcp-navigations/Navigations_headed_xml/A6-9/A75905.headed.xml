<HEAD>To the sincere lover of the peace of JERUSALEM, The Translator hereof wisheth increase of knowledge, and an improvement of that Talent here, to Gods glory, and perpetual felicity in the world to come.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Orasmuch as <HI>(Noble Reader) Jerusa∣lem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 17.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.</NOTE> the City of our God, even upon his holy mountain the joy of the whole earth, and the City of the great King, that fair and most ancient City, by a special Prerogative is by God himselfe beautified above all other Cities, and was therefore the chief, most noble and famous City of the world: Many Travellers and Pilgrims, have at sundry times, both in Maps and Histories, described the same. By the advantage of whose labours therein, now of late years, one <HI>Christian Adrichom,</HI> [Anno <HI>1585.</HI>] hath performed a most lively description, and in the Latine tongue, enriched with divers Antiquities. The profit that might come hereby to my Country-men of the vulgar sort, both for the better understanding of the story of the Bible, where <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the parts thereof are oftentimes mentioned, and also for the ready conceiving of <HI>Josephus his history,</HI> moved me to translate it into the <HI>English</HI> tongue: And the book thus translated, with the charts expressed in natural colours, I have presumed to present unto your view. And because
<PB REF="3"/>the Master-workman in this new plat of old decayed <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> hath left behind him some rubbish and relicks of the <HI>Romish</HI> superstition; I have in some measure purged and swept the streets and corners of the same, with the broom of truth, and carrying them out by the Scoure-gate, or Dung-gate, have laid them on the Leystall of oblivion <HI>[and as for some that do yet remain, here is now left a purgation, by addition of Annotations.]</HI> My pains herein taken, though not so great, as the laying of <HI>Jerusalems</HI> founda∣tion, or the raising of a chief corner stone, or the squaring and finishing any part of this exquisite plat: yet such it is, as even in the meanest degree of a poor labourer, that doth but sweep the streets, I beseech you to accept as a small mite of my good will. The which I gladly offer, to the end that amidst the burdens and snares of your worldly affairs, you beholding this most brave City, adorned with so glorious a Temple, and contemplating the Passion of our Saviour Christ therein, may be delighted and recreated: And fur∣ther, that viewing this terrestrial City, whose glory is now vanished, you may think still as the Apostle did say, <HI>Non habe∣mus hic manentem civitatem [We have not here an abiding City,</HI> Heb. <HI>13.14.]</HI> and so aspire to that heaven∣ly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> garnished, and full stored with all manner of delights, which abideth for ever; Wherein I do most humbly and heartily wish you a most happy residence, after you have performed your short course in this life, in the service of your God, and of your friends and Country, and the general benefit, and comfort of your own soule.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Author <HI>Chri. Andric.</HI></BYLINE>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Orsomuch as the truth of History, is the foundation of faith, and of spiritual un∣derstanding (Christian Reader) and the history of things done, blind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron. Tom. <HI>3.</HI> Epis. <HI>27.</HI> ad Dard.</NOTE> and imper∣fect, without the knowledge of places, the which knowledge giveth much light, both to the truth of History, and also to the spirituall interpretation there∣of;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The scope of this Book.</NOTE> therefore I have thought good to observe two things with great diligence in this work. First, that I might portray and set forth the true and lively Image of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> of all other Cities the most glorious and famous throughout the whole world, whereof mention is made in sacred and in prophane histories, as it flourished in Christ his time; and also the forme of the Temple (the fame whereof hath been extolled above the heavens, and was worthy of eternal me∣mory) by the sacred Scriptures, by approved Writers, and by ancient tradition of faithful and trusty men, in a lively plot, or Map, most exquisitly drawn, together with the names, originals, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituations, and forms of every place, and the most worthy Histories concerning the same, with all brevity. Secondly, that I might rightly dispose the places of Christ his Passion, and represent every thing which he suffered in every place, even as if they were now done before our eyes, and so represented, that I might explain it with plainness and brevity. For hereby all those things which he suffer∣ed
<PB REF="4"/>for our sakes, will be both more plainly understood, and also more profitably remembred. But peradventure there will be some which will mislike this our endea∣vour, and the rather because we have many things by tradition of Elders; to whom I answer out of <HI>Hierom,</HI> where he saith, <HI>That Ecclesiastical traditions, which are no hindrance to faith, are so to be kept, as they were delivered by the Ancients.</HI> In the mean time I will not say, that they are too rash, and too too wicked, which will de∣ny that thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hier. Tom. <HI>1.</HI> Epist. <HI>28.</HI> ad L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cinium.</NOTE> which hath been godly received at all times, and of all men. So many of us therefore as are washed with the bloud of Christ, doe bear his name, and are called Christians, if our faith the answering to our name, and our life, not disagreeing from the truth, hoping to be saved by the merits and grace of Christ our Saviour, let us beleeve that, which incorrupt and reverend Antiquity hath left, let us in no wise depart from those things [which our <HI>Ancestors</HI> have celebrated without any superstition, &amp;] w<SUP>ch</SUP> by the consent of the whole world, are come even from them to our hands, and with thankfull godlinesse, and godly thankfulness, let us call to minde those places oftentimes, which may put us in remembrance of the Passion of Christ; to which places this Map will lead us, as it were by the hand; and with the eyes of faith, and of our minde, let us look upon the same Sonne of God, and inwardly behold him, who being urged with the great love of our salvation, having finished his last Supper in the Parlour of <HI>Sion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">[The summe of Christs Passion.]</NOTE> and being come into the Garden of Olivet, prayed and swet blood, through the anguish and grievous consideration of the immi∣nent afflictions. Immediately he was betrayed by the most wicked <HI>Judas;</HI> he was taken, bound, and thrust
<PB REF="4"/>forward by the <HI>Jews,</HI> even as a Lamb by the Wolves, most cruelly amidst the noise of clamors and weapons, and then was lead to the house of <HI>Anna</HI> the high Priest; There he was stricken; from thence hee was drawn to the Pallace of <HI>Caiphas;</HI> in the same hee was falsely accused, condemned, spit upon, blindfolded, buffeted with fists, and sundry wayes all the night scorned and afflicted. In the morning he was violently carried through the midst of the City to the house of <HI>Pilate.</HI> From thence he was lead to the Pallace of <HI>Herod,</HI> and accused again, despised of him, mocked, and apparrelled like a fool in a white garment, and brought back again by another way of the City to <HI>Pilate.</HI> There again he was accused of many faults, stripped, and grievously whipped, cloathed with purple, crowned with thorns, diversly derided, spit upon, buf∣feted with fists, and stricken with a reed, and be∣ing thus misused, was made a gazing stock to the peo∣ple, and adjudged to death. Then he was loaden with a heavy Crosse, and in the sight of all the people, with grievous and bloody steps he was drawn, punched, and urged by the furious violence of the souldiers, through a great part of the City, and by the gate of Judge∣ment out of the City, by a hard and stony way, even unto mount <HI>Calvary.</HI> And being come thither he was stripped again, and being both faint and weary, was refreshed with gall instead of drinke; and about high∣noon he was fastened to the Crosse, and so lifted up on high; and hanging on the crosse by the space of three hours, was derided with taunts and reproachful words; being thirsty, they gave him vineger to drink. Finally, he which could save the world with one drop of his blood, would needs bestow upon us by the five rivers
<PB REF="5"/>of his wounds, his life, with all his blood. A figure hereof was that Brazen-serpent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 21.3. Ioh. 3.14.</NOTE> which <HI>Moses</HI> caused to be exalted in the wilderness. To this spectacle also our heavenly Father calleth every faithful soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cant. 3.11.</NOTE> <HI>Come forth</HI> (saith he) <HI>ye daughters of Sion, and see King Solo∣mon;</HI> Nay one far greater then <HI>Solomon.</HI> In like manner Christ hanging on the Crosse cryeth out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lam. of Ier. 1.12</NOTE> <HI>O all ye which passe by the way, behold, and see, if there be any sorrow and grief like mine.</HI></P>
<P>And not only to the consideration and meditation of these things, but also to the imitation, God in the holy Scripture exhorteth us in these words (spiritually in∣terpreted) saying, <HI>Look, and make all things according to the example or fashion which was shewed thee in the Mount.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod 25.40. Heb. 8.5.</NOTE> For all the precepts of life, which our Saviour taught all the time of his preaching,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The best book is Chirsts pattern.</NOTE> as well by word, as by example, the same he expressed in himself in one day of his passion; wherefore if we would follow Christ, not only in word, but also in work; we may, by his lively crucifying on mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> as it were out of a gol∣den book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Latine, Greek, and Hebrew. Ioh. 19.20.</NOTE> intituled with the noble title of Three most principal languages, written with the quils of the spear, of the nails, of the thorns, and of the whips, in the most pure parchment of the Immaculate Lamb, and with the purple blood of the same, both learned and unlearned, learn easily and briefly perfect Theology, the most wholesome remedies of Physicke, the full knowledge of Law, and of Justice, the science of li∣beral Arts, of true humility, of obedience, of piety, of charity, of patience; finally of all manner of vertues, and of things most perfect; and may also be inflamed and drawn to love and follow Christ. Thus the bles∣sed Virgin, standing neer to the Cross of Christ, did
<PB REF="5"/>not onely with bodily eyes, but also in heart, through faith (which wavered not in her) behold the wounds of her Son, and seriously thinking thereon, was so comforted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambros. in Luc. cap. <HI>23. Iohn 19.</HI></NOTE> that now (as <HI>Ambrose</HI> saith) she was pre∣pared also to dye for the good of mankinde. So S. <HI>John</HI> both seeing the side of Christ opened with a spear, bloud with water coming forth of the same, and so giving testimony thereunto, did by the medi∣tation thereof so greatly profit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 23. <HI>Hier. Tom.</HI> 1. <HI>Epist.</HI> 13. <HI>ad Paulinum.</HI> Mar. 15.</NOTE> that at the last he be∣came a most perfect divine, and a soaring Eagle to be∣hold the most holy, <HI>and blessed God the Father in the Son.</HI> So the Theef, when he saw and heard Christ Jesus crucified, incontinently turned unto Christ, and con∣fessing him, he made the punishment of murder, Mar∣tyrdome, and changed the Cross for Paradise. So also the <HI>Centurion</HI> by this spectacle, received so great strength of faith, that under the Cross he was made a famous Confessor of Christ; and further (as <HI>Chry∣sostome</HI> saith) was afterward crowned with <HI>Martyrdome:</HI> Moreover <HI>Thomas</HI> beholding and touching the wounds of Christ crucified, was so illuminated with faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chrys. in Mat. c. <HI>27.</HI></NOTE> that he plainly and openly professed Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 30.27.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> to be both his Lord, and his God.</P>
<P>This being so, and love procuring love, even as the Loadstone draweth Iron; who is he, I pray you, whom so vehement love of Christ, nay rather a heat and flame will not affect, kindle, and set on fire? Who is he, when at the death of Christ all creatures doe suffer with him, the Sun darkned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 27.45.5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> the vail of the Temple rent in sunder, the earth quaking, Rockes break∣ing, graves opening, and the dead arising; Who, and what is hee (I say) that will not wonder, and that will not bee abashed? Onely <HI>Adams</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>children, for whose cause he dyed, are not moved with this so great a benefit.</P>
<P>The Adamant, that most hard stone, is mollified with the blood of a Goat; Iron with the heat of fire is made soft;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 8.10.</NOTE> but the hearts of Christians, more hard then Adamant or Iron, are not mollified with the blood and fire of Christ, but do crucifie a fresh unto themselves the Son of God, and do tread under their feet the bloud of the Testament.</P>
<P>What I pray you can be more beseeming, more meet, more just, and more profitable for us, then to love again him that so loveth us; and imitate him whom we love? For if any thing herein seem hard, if any thing grievous, that thing, love (the sweet yoke of the Lord) maketh light and easie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Joh. 5.3.</NOTE> for all labour is light, to him that loveth, according to that notable sentence of that ancient <HI>Gregory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Epist.</NOTE> <HI>Nihil adeo grave est, quod non aequanimiter toleretur, si Christi passio ad memo∣riam reducatur.</HI> There is nothing so heavy and burthen∣some, but the same is willingly born, if so be the Pas∣sion of Christ be remembred.</P>
<P>For we will indure all things with patience as light and easie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.2, 3▪</NOTE> if we call to minde what hard words, harder stripes, and most hard pains and afflictions he suffered for us, whose head was crowned with thorns, his eyes blind-folded, his ears filled with reproaches, his mouth with gall and vineger, his face polluted with spitting, his cheeks bruised with buffeting, his knees shaking, his shoulders laden with the Cross, his heart replenish∣ed with sorrow, his body torn with whips, his mem∣bers racked, his hands and feet bored; to be briefe, from the crown of the head, to the soals of the foot, he sustained an innumerable sort of wounds and sor∣rows.
<PB REF="6"/>Wherefore as the waters of <HI>Mara,</HI> being some∣times bitter, were made sweet by <HI>Moses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15.25.</NOTE> at what time he cast wood into them; even so all our tribulation, if we patiently indure the Crosse of Christ, will waxe sweet, and the gall thereof will turn into honey. For by the meditations of these afflictions of our Saviour, faith is illuminated, hope strengthned, charity infla∣med, and all vertue increased. Wherefore holy <HI>Au∣gustine,</HI> a light of the Church, no lesse truly then godly, provoking us by very forceable words thereunto; saith thus, <HI>Behold the wounds of him that hangeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">August. in lib. de virginitate</NOTE> <HI>the blood of him that dyeth, the price of the redeemer, the scars of him that riseth; His head boweth to kisse thee, his heart is opened to love thee, his armes stretched abroad to imbrace thee, his whole body set forth to redeem thee. Consider what, and how great these things be, weigh them in the ballance of your hearts, that hee may bee wholy fastened in your hearts, who for us was wholly fastened on the Crosse.</HI> Thus far <HI>Augustine.</HI> So that it is not enough to me∣ditate of these things once, but it is profitable to thinke upon them often; yea the oftner, the more they avail and profit. In the wholesome contemplation of whose Passion, although we profit much, yet we shall never attain to the perfect knowledge thereof, but there will remain still somewhat that we may seek for, the full knowledge whereof is reserved to our hea∣venly Country. In the mean time, let us contemplate in these things day and night; in these things let us recreate and busie our selves. In these let us watch, in these let us sleep, yea to dye in the meditation of these things, is most Christian, and available to everlasting salvation.</P>

<HEAD>SEVEN GENERAL RULES For Expounding Scriptures that speak of Christs coming, and King∣dom, and Judging, and of destroy∣ing <HI>Babylon;</HI> and of the calling of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Israel.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> <SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the Truth of God is fulfilled, both by the outward work, by which he appears in the World, and by the secret Mystery by which he reveals himself in, and to the Spirits of his Saints, (which two answer one another:) So in the Testimony of the Scripture, there is frequently, not onely the <HI>History</HI> in the Letter, but a <HI>Spiri∣tual Mystery</HI> in the sense thereof, as is clear in that of <HI>Hagar</HI> and <HI>Sarah, Gal. 4.</HI> And of the Rock and Manna, and of <HI>Mel∣chisedech,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>1 Cor. 10.3, 4. Heb. 7.1, 2.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> In all Scriptural Interpretations, the Analogy of Faith is to be respected, <HI>Rom. 12.5.</HI> That is, Undeniable principles of Truth clearly held out in other Scriptures, which have a special proportion to the place which is to be interpreted, ac∣cording to which, the sense thereof must needs be.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> And hence, as Christs coming and judging imply sometimes some special manifestation of him, and sometimes his personal coming at his Incarnation, or that second coming that shall be at the restoring of all things, (<HI>Heb. 9.28. Acts 3.19, 20, 21.</HI> with <HI>Rom. 11.26.</HI> and <HI>Isa. 59.29.</HI> So some of such Prophecies are appliable to both his comings, and to several times of his manifestation, <HI>Mal. 3.1, 2, 6. Matth. 16.20.</HI> with
<PB N="2" REF="8"/><HI>Mark 9.1, 2. Joh. 6.18. Zach. 14.1, 4. Psal. 97.98, last verses.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> As there is <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> Mystical▪ as well as Literal, <HI>(Revel. 17.4. &amp; 11.8.)</HI> So some Prophesies (as <HI>Psal. 137. Jer. 50. &amp; 51.</HI>) seem appliable to the sin and ruine of both those <HI>Babylons.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> As there are <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as well spiritual as natural, <HI>Rom. 2.3 last verses, Gal. 6.17.

<HEAD>The Reasons why some Traditions of Reliques are forborn in the Translation; and why some are published.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be granted, that this <HI>Breidenbach, Brocard, Pasch, Saligniac,</HI> (as also <HI>Tyren</HI>) were <HI>Roman</HI> Catho∣licks, and that they desired the promoting of their Religion; a great part whereof, is, in visiting of Saints <HI>Reliques;</HI> and they received from their An∣cestors many <HI>Traditions,</HI> which they respect and up∣hold as much, as, yea, more then the <HI>Word of God</HI> it self.</P>
<P>Hence several such <HI>Passages</HI> that were in the <HI>Latin,</HI> are left out by the <HI>Translator;</HI> as that of <HI>Veronica</HI>'s Neckerchere,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Or Section 42. of the Book.</NOTE> <HI>Numb.</HI> 42 and of <HI>Pelagia</HI>'s House: So also this about <HI>Helen's finding the Cross, by the wonder∣ful smell or odor of the Spices and Oyntments, which the Earth sent forth: By which miracle, that venerable
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>Empress was confirmed,</HI> say those Popish Authors (in <HI>Number</HI> 240.) Which argues. That the Women an∣ointed Christs Body with that precious Ointment or Odors upon the Cross: <HI>For that anointing of Christs feet, was six or seven days before Christs death,</HI> Joh. 12.1, 2. Whereas the <HI>Scriptures</HI> shew most plainly, That the Women bought not those Spices for Ointments and Odors to Christs Body, until Christ was taken from the Cross, and buried: Which Odors they brought, not to the empty Cross, but to the Garden where Christ was buried, some way distant from the Cross; and there they would have anointed him, but did not, because Christ was risen before they came, <HI>Luke</HI> 23.53, 56. <HI>&amp;</HI> 24.1. <HI>Matth.</HI> 27.57. <HI>&amp;</HI> 28.1, 2. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.1, 2, 6.</P>
<P>Hence the <HI>Translator</HI> forbears this, and divers of such vain <HI>Traditions,</HI> as tend to make the Word of God of none effect (<HI>Matth.</HI> 15.6, 9.) some of them remain, that the <HI>Reader</HI> may know, in what place the <HI>Relick∣mongers</HI> will shew such and such things, which never were there; as the <HI>Note</HI> added from <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> makes evident. Which <HI>Note</HI> being observed in <HI>love to the truth,</HI> may tend to prevent that dreadful doom of the damnable deceivers and deceived, denounced in 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.10, 12. <HI>With all deceivableness of unrighte∣ousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause, God shall send them strong delusions, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</HI> I could name one whom I knew, noted for miserable cove∣tousness, when in sickness he prevailed not to be ab∣solved by a <HI>Minister,</HI> was prevailed with by a <HI>Priest</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>that (it Ieems) absolved him, to visit Saint <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Buxtons</HI> Well; which he did, and returned a con∣firmed <HI>Papist,</HI> by this <HI>lying strong delusion;</HI> which he (poor wretch) believed, <HI>viz. That he was shewed, and saw the very Well it self, into which Saint</HI> Annes <HI>head fell, being cut off by a villain that would have abused ber. Her Brother hearing of it, came after Mass was ended, took his sisters head, and put it right upon her neck and presently she revived. I saw the Well it self, where this was done,</HI> said he.</P>
<P>This warning is premised, That by being <HI>forewarn∣ed,</HI> thou maist be <HI>fore-armed</HI> against the poyson of such <HI>Basilisks,</HI> and maist <HI>tread such Serpents under thy feet.</HI> Remembring 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.10. Many things are here truly recorded from <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>Josephus,</HI> and <HI>Jerom,</HI> and others, cited by those men. <HI>But can any good come out of</HI> Galilee; or shall we receive <HI>truth</HI> from <HI>Papists? Answ. Truth</HI> is more precious then <HI>Silver,</HI> or <HI>Gold,</HI> or <HI>Rubies.</HI> Can you be content to take up <HI>Silver,</HI> or <HI>Gold,</HI> or <HI>precious Pearls,</HI> though you espie then on a <HI>Dunghil,</HI> or in the <HI>Kennel?</HI> Then disdain not to own <HI>Truth,</HI> which is far more excellent, wheresoever you can espie it: Onely look up to the <HI>God of all grace,</HI> who hath given us his own Son, to be our <HI>Way, Truth,</HI> and <HI>Life;</HI> that he would reveal his Son to us, and in us; that by him we may savingly know, and <HI>love the truth, as it is in Jesus;</HI> and may by his light, discern and abhor every false way. <HI>Try all things</HI> (that are held out for truths) <HI>hold fast that which is good;</HI> (as the noble <HI>Bereans</HI> did, to their souls everlasting benefit, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.11.) <HI>and abstain from all appearance of evil. And the very God of peace sanctifie you wholly,</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.21, 22, 23. This is the humble request of</P>

<P>The <HI>Jewes</HI> glad of this, came from all parts of the world to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and threatning grievous things against the Christians, they prepared and got unto them skilfull work-men, stones, tim∣ber, morter, and all other things necessary for the building; also they caused to be made silver mattocks, spades, and baskets, and throughly purged the place where the Temple stood, with such speed and willingnesse, that their women also bestowed all their ouches, taches, bruches, and other Jewels for the building, and carried out from that place all the rubbish in their laps. And when the Foundations were opened and cleansed, the day follow∣ing they should have begun their Foundation, but the same night there came such an exceeding and vehement tempest, that it carri∣ed away and scattered abroad their stone, timber, and morter, with other their necessaries. Over, and besides this, a great Earthquake shook all the stones of the old foundations of the Temple, and dispersed them, disordered the houses next adjoyning to the Temple by a down-fall and killed many <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>And when they which remained, in the morning enterprised again to build, a fire falling from heaven, a flame also breaking forth from the foundations of the Temple, destroyed more <HI>Jewes</HI> then before, which either were busie about the work, or which came thither to see and look on; and all that day burnt, and con∣sumed into ashes, their Mauls, Hammers, Axcs, Spades, and all other working Tools, that nothing was left.

And thus being astonished and confounded, they left off both their vaine enterprise, and also the place. So that by their wicked endeavour, the divine Oracle was not onely not made frustrate, but also more fulfilled and confirmed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jewes</HI> being in this sort beaten from their enterprise, the Christians neverthelesse were not afraid to build in the same place; for they erected a Temple there in a round form, made of great hewne, <NOTE PLACE="marg">VVith.
