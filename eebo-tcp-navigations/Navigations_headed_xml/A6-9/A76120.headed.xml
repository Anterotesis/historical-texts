<HEAD>A true RELATION Of what past betweene the Fleet of his Highnes the Prince of Wales, and that under the Command of the Earle of Warwick.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Nderstandinge that there are divers reports and untruthes vented concerninge his High∣nes the Prince of Wales goeinge up into the River of Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes, I have thought good as being an eye wittnesse of all the proceedings to set forth the truth with out any partiality.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="August"/> August it was resolved by his Highnesse Coun∣cell in the Downes in regard of the shortnesse of provisions, especialy beare, to goe for Holl∣and to new victuall, to which purpose the Fleet wayinge that day stood for the North forland, where we mett with one of our small vessells who had binn abroad for intelligence, who tould us the Earle of Warwick was coming
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>downe as low as the boy of the Redsand, where∣upon we presently stood back for Marget Road hopeinge that night or next morning to have mett with him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27" UNIT="August"/> Hearing noe newes of him we wayed &amp; stood towards the coast of Holland, but the seamen would by noe meanes be perswaded, but would be contented with halfe allowance or lesse, soe that they might goe into the River of Thames, to meet with the said Earle.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="August"/> Whereupon the 28th. in the morning we way∣ed and stood for the longe sand head, and Anc∣kored there that night.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="August"/> We wayed and stood up into the River the wind then at South East, and when we were within a League of the Spitts saw the Earle of Warwick, and all his Fleet, about 3 a clock the headmost of his Ships fireing some gunnes to give warneing to his Fleet when they saw us, who presently stood back in to the River againe we followeing them, and that night they gott up as high as the cant and there Anckered, we could not fetch neare them by 3 miles but sem a Ketch to him, with a summons from the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>Prince, of which we receaved answeare about 12 a clock at night.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="August"/> We wayed with the Flood, the wind Westerly and plyed towards him, he then likewise wayed and still plied up into the River, and was gott open of the mouth of the River of med way by which tyme the van of our Fleet were gott near him and ready to ingage, at which tyme a sud∣aine gust, came at North West, with much vic∣lence that we were both Fleets forced to chapp to an anckor sudainly, one of his Frigatts spend∣inge his maine Topmast or rather the head of his mayne Mast, &amp; in truth this sudaine storme did demonstrate to us that God was unwillinge to have any bloud spilt. <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="August"/> Rideing thus at an anckor all that evening and night till next day 11 a clock the wind still continueing betweene the North West, and West North West, and we within amile of each other, but still a hard gale of wind. The Prince perceaveing he could noe wise ingage them. About 9 of the clock shot of a warning peice and loosed the fore Topsaile not waighinge in two howers after, and vvhen he waighed left the Viseadmirall Rearadmirall and Convertine to bringe up the reare. The
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>Prince with the Fleet standing avvay, with his Topsaile downe on the chapp to go for Holland and indeed it was high tyme, there being not in the Ships more then a butt of beare &amp; no vvater.</P>
<P>After we had stood away from him two lea∣gues, he waighed with his Fleet as if he would have done something, and stood after us with all his sayles, we still makeing noe more sayle, and as he or any of his Fleet came neare to us, we stayinge for them they would doe the like and off the Spitts all his Fleet came by the lee night in hand we standing away our course for Holland with lights upon the Admiralls poope. <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="September"/> Septemb: About 11 of the clock saw Goree Church and in the afternoone landed his Hyghnesse in one of the small Frigatts, all the Fleet getting in but the Admirall and two more.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="September"/> The other two Ships gott in but the Admirall could not.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="September"/> The wind at North West, the Admirall could not waigh, and being without any drinck 24 howers cut Cable and rann into Hellivootsluise.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a true and impartiall rela∣tion of the whole businesse to stopp the mout∣hes of all those who report the Prince fled from
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>the Earle of Warvvick, for I must doe his High∣nesse that right that I never saw a man more ready and willinge to engage his owne person, then he was; for when S<SUP>r</SUP> William Batten and others came to him, desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing him to goe down his ansvvere was, he would never agree to it, it being not for his honour, so that a resolution vvas taken if they came to ingage to have car∣ied him dovvne by force.</P>
<P>And novv though I have done vvith the re∣lation, yet I must say somethinge in vindication of the judgements of the sea commanders under vvhose spheare it vvill most properly fall.</P>
<P>I knovv it vvil be obiected and that justly to, unlesse cleared a great deale of undiscretion in this businesse.</P>
<P>As first the coming into the River vvith soe small a proportion of victualls, and secondly, to offer to ingage such Schips in soe narrovv a straight and soe much disadvantage on the Princes side.</P>
<P>To both vvhich I ansvvear it was quite against the sence of the councell, but occationed by the resolutions I vvill not say discretion of the sea∣men, for in all me life I never savv men more ready &amp; unanimous to engage then they vvere.</P>
