<HEAD>A SH RT Instruction in the Art of Navigation.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He art of Navigation is a Science by which through certaine rules you may steere a Shipp over the Seas from one place to another, and is not improperly devided into two parts, to witt, into ordinary and extra∣ordinary Navigation. The ordinary Navigation useth no other Instruments, then the Compasse and sounding Plummet, as principally consisting in experience and practice, in knowledge of Lands and Corners, how they are different in Points and distances and are knowne from the Sea, in depths, shoales qualityes of grounds: the running and falling of Streames! upon what point the Moone maketh high water in every severall place &amp; such like which in part are learned from the information of ex∣perienced Pilots, but most out of our owne experience.</P>
<P>Extraordinary Navigation useth besides the foresayd ordinary practise divers other private Instruments and rules which must bee taken out of Astronomy and Cos∣mography. It is therefore needfull that every Pilot who will use and practise th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s extraordinary Navigation, must first of all bee well instructed in the principales of the same Arts, that is, that hee know and understand the propor∣tions and devisions of the Spheare of the World, the mo∣tions of the Heavens, especially the eighth, fourth and first together with the Fabrique of the Instruments, with∣out which knowledge its impossible to accomplish hap∣pily, greate and never before sought out Voyages over the Vast Seas. And seeing that such knowledge may bee attained out of good Instruction wee have here set downe in this Tractate for the benefit of young seamen who are desiruns to bee Pilots as cleare and plaine rules as the shortnesse hereof could suffer.</P>

<P>A Spheare properly is called a Ball, wholly entire and round, whose superficies and outside is ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where alike distant from its center. By that World <HI>Sphoera Mundi,</HI> or Spheare of the World, wee understand commonly the whole Ball of the Heavens with all that is therein con∣tained! and it is devided into two parts Elementary &amp; Coe∣lestiall the Elementary part hath againe 4 parts: the first is the earth, which with the water as the second maketh a compleate Ball upon which wee dwell. The third is the Aire encompassing the earth and the fourth is the fire, which according to the opinion of Philosophers containeth the space which is betweene the Aire and the Spheare of the Moone. From these Elements (which are the beginning of all things) which are alwayes subject to changes, together with the Warmth of the Heavens arise and perish by a continuall change and alteration of the one into the other, all things which wee see and find upon Earth.</P>
<P>The Celestiall part (containing within in its Hollow∣nesse the Elementaryes) is pure shining, Seperate and voyd of all changes, is devided into 8 Speares or round Hollow Balles, which are called Heavens whereof the greatest alwayes containeth one the other in man∣ner of a Ball, the seaven lowest have, but every one

The number of these Heavens are knowne by their Courses which wee see in them round about the Poles of the Zodiaque. The Moone runneth through her Heaven by her own naturall course from West to East in 27 dayes, 8 howres, Mercury Venus and the Sunne theirs in a yeare. Mars his in two yeares, Iu∣piter his in 12, and Saturne in 30 yeares; The eighth hea∣ven perfects its owne course, according to the affirmation of <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> in 25400 yeares; These Heavens are turned about all alike in four and twenty houwres on the Poles about the Axes of the World by the ninth Heaven, which is called the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> that is the first mover by which Motion in our sight is caused Day and Night, and the daily rising and falling of the heavenly lights.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Second Point, Of the Round∣nesse of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Earth with the Water together maketh a round Globe, appeareth not onely out of expe∣rience very clearely, but also out part of the Shaddow of Earth in the Eclips of the Moone. In whatsoever part of the Heaven the moon is Eclipsed or touched by the Shad∣dow of the earth, that Shaddow seemeth alwayes round. If the earth were foure square, three corned, or of any other forme, then the Shaddow of the moone should bee also foure square, three cornerd or some other forme! For of what proportion any body is, such also must bee the Shaddow thereof. And seeing therefore that the Shad∣dow of the earth is alwayes and on al sides round, the earth itselfe must alsoo bee necessarilly round.</P>
<P>That the Heaven is round wee marke from the eye, but is most clearely perceived from the Circular motions of the heavenly lights, as of the Sonne Moone and Starres.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Third Point that the Earth is in the middle of the World.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THat the earth standeth in the middle of the World, may clearely bee understood by what is hereafter spoken: for if soo bee that the Globe of the earth stood not in the middle of the World, but that the heaven was nearer it on one side, it would come to passe, that the stars in their daily courses should bee nearer on one side of the earth then on the other, and by that meanes should appe∣are to our sight to bee greater on one side of the earth then on the other: likewise if that part of the heaven next to the earth were a boveus, we should then see lesse then halfe of the heaven according to instruction of the first Fi∣gure: and on the contrary when that part of the heaven farthest from us were above us wee should then see more then halfe of the Heaven according to the Instruction of the second Figure. But standing upon the flatt side of the Globe wee see the Starres as well on the one side as on the other (in whatsoever part of the Heaven that it is) alwayes of one greatenesse, and it is found by experience, that wee alwayes see the one half of the Heaven, and the other halfe is hidden from our eyes, from thence it ap∣peares plainly according to the expression in the third Figure. That the earth stands in the middle of the World: From thence is likewise to bee marked that the Globe of the earth is no more to bee likened by the Heavens then a point without thicknesse for if the earth had any thick∣nesse in respect of Heaven, wee should (standing upon the earth) by that reason not see halfe of the Heaven ac∣cording to Demonstration of the 4 Figure.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The fourth Point, Of the greatnesse. of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough the Globe of the Earth (as is sayd) in re∣spect of the extraordinary widenesse of the Heaven is no more then a point, neverthelesse in respect of its selfe it is a greate body, having in its Compasse 5400 dutch Miles. And that is knowne by this meanes. If you devide the whole Circkle of the Compasse of the earth into 360 parts or degrees, and wee find as well by Navigation as by measuring of Land that such a Degree or part con∣taineth fifteene such Dutch Miles 360 such part beeing multiplyed by fifteene make out 5400 Duth miles.</P>

<HEAD>The fifth Point, Of the Axis and Poles or Axepoints of the World.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Globe of the World is imagined to bee a Line, going from one Point on the side of the Spheare (as a Diameter through the Center) to another Point right against it on the other side. That Line is called the Axis and the outermost-ends thereof, or the foresayd Points, the Poles or Axepoints of the World, the one towards the North, and is called the Northerne Pole and the other towards the South, called the Southerne Pole.

<P>IN the middest of the Heavens every where equally di∣stant from both the Poles, is imagined a greate Circle, dividing the whole Spheare into two equall parts which is called the Aequinoctial, because when the Sonne com∣meth to or under that Cirkle which commeth to passe the 21 of March, and the 23 of September, the day and night are in all places of the Earth of an equall length. The knowledge of this Cirkle is proffitable above all things in Navigation, to know thereby how farr wee goe either to the Northwards or Southwards upon Earth; thereby also is reckoned the time and hower of the day, the Declination of the Sonn and Starrs, and more other proffitable things.</P>

<HEAD>The Eleaventh Point. How to find the Sonnes Declination upon every day in the yeare.</HEAD>
<P>THe yeare of the Sonne (that is the time wherin the Sonne goeth out of a certaine point in the Eclipti∣que, and turneth againe into the same) and is not just 365 dayes, but about 5 houres and 49 minutes (that is litle lesse then 6 howers more, wherefore it is that we alwayes adde after three yeares to the South 4 times 6 howers that is a day to the Month February thereby to count the yeare or Revolation of the Sonne into equall dayes, there∣fore every such fourth yeare is called the Leap-yeare. If therefore you will then sett the Sonnes Declination by day tables it is needfull to make foure sundry tables of foure such following yeares. The foresayd difference of foure Revolutions of the Sonne come not equally alike with such foure yeares, being with length of time soo much difference in the Declination that it is needfull to re∣new such Tables every twenty yeares.</P>
<P>Now to find the Declination of the Sonne out of such Tables upon every day of the yeare it is needfull to know two things, the first in what yeare you are, either the Leap-yeare, or in the first second or third yeare after. The second, when you know the yeare which of the Tables you must use thereto.</P>
<P>For the first! devide the yeare of our Lord 1600 by 4 if the devision commeth even out without remainders, such a yeare is then a Leape-yeare of 366 dayes, but if out of the division any number remaineth, such remainders shew you how much that such a proposed yeare is after the Leape-yeare.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first Example.</HEAD>
<P>I Desire to know what for a yeare 1644, is leaving the 1600, take and devide the remaining 44 by 4, that com∣meth even out without remainders for 11 times 4 is 44, and from thence I find that the yeare 1644, to be a Leape-yeare.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Second Example.</HEAD>
<P>FOr to know what sort of yeare 1647. is, leaving the 1600.

<P>The second for to know which Table you must use to every yeare that standeth demonstrated above each of the following Tables.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first Example.</HEAD>
<P>IN the second yeare following the Leape yeare upon the 20 of May, I desire to know the Sonnes Declination! I seeke in the Tables the Month of May, in the second yeare and there under in the first Collumne of the figures the twentieth day, I find in the second Collumne 20, 4. That is 20 degrees and 4 minutes, to bee the Sonnes De∣clination. And seeing that it is betweene the 20 of March, and the 23 of September (that the Son is by northwards of the Line) soo comes it to passe that the Declination is Northerly.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The second Example.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the 12 of February in the Leape yeare, I desire to know the Sonnes declination seeke therefore in the Table of Leape yeares toe Month of February, and count in the first Collumne to the 12 day, and you find there by it 13 degrees and 14 minutes for the Declina∣tion of the Sonne on that day; seeing that it is be∣tweene the 23 of September and 20 of March, that the Sonne goeth by South the Line, The Declination is then Southerly.</P>
<P>Now follow the Tables of the Sonnes Declination reckoned properly, upon the length of the earth or Me∣ridian of Englands Landt-End, because that this length is used most by our Netherland seamen as well in running, upon the Channell of the Sea, as alongst the Coasts of France, Portugal and Spaine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>NOTA.</HEAD>
<P>LOok how many degrees and minutes the Line is raised above the Horizon; just so many degrees and minutes are there between the point right over your head, called the Zenith and the Pole, and thence it followeth, that as many degrees and minutes as there bee betweene the Zenith and the line, just as many are there from the Ho∣rizon to the Pole; that is to say, so many degrees is the Pole elevated, therefore when we say we are in such a height, wee understand that wee are so many degrees on the north or the southside of the line. This rule and in∣struction is universal and common through out the whole World both ih the north and southside of the line.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>An Admonition to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IF a man would observe the height of the Sunne, it is necessary that he know how many foot he stands above the water, for the higher a man stand the farther hee is from the Horizon, because that from the eye to the Ho∣rizon, is 60 degrees, if wee stand waterpas, as they call it; but if he stand higher then the water, as is sayd, it will bee more then 60 degrees to the Horizon; And to mend this fault, I have here placed a table, thereby to know whether wee stand highe, then the water or no; and how many minutes difference it makes, and also how much neerer the eye the Crosse standeth, then adding the min. to that which the Crosse standeth below the Zenith, so shall you mend the fault, that is to say, that you see the crosse so many minutes downward, look on the table following.</P>

<P>LEt your eye bee above the water, suppose 27 feet, that the crosse may stand 45 degrees from the Zenith (that is beginning to tell from that end where the eye is) these 27 feet, being sought in the first rancke, or Columne of the Table, and you shall find over against it 6 minutes, so much is the Horizon below, that which they call the waterpas or the surface of the water, and so many feet must the crosse bee thrust downward, so will it fall out 45 degrees 6 minutes, where the Crosse ought to bee.</P>

<P>EXperience teacheth, that the lights of heaven, by how much they are nearer the Horizon, by so much doe they seeme to bee higher then indeed they are; and by reason of the fumes and damps, which continually arise &amp; as they are nearer the Horizon, so much are they more thick, and rising by little and little; they lessen, and at the least are cleane vanished, and as wee come nearer the Pole, the vapoers do more and more increase, and for that cause doe the lights seeme to bee higher than they are. Yea it is found about the height of 83 degrees towards the north, that the Sunne seemeth to bee 40 minutes hi∣gher than in truth it is, this hath that famous Astronomer Ticho Brahe searched out and written in Denmarck, as you may see in this table.</P>

<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>LEt the height of the Sunne be measured; and found to bee 7 degrees above the Horizon, and in the table of the Sunne above written, there are 13 minutes which the Sunne seemeth to bee higher than it is, therefore substract 13 minutes from the 7 degrees, there will remaine 6 de∣grers 47 minutes for the true height of the Sunne.</P>
<P>But if we take the distance of the Sun from the Zenith according to this example, it would bee found to bee 83 degrees, and then the 13 min. added to the 83 degrees the product is 83 degr. 13 min. for the true distance of the Sunne from the Zenith, then if we take 83 degr. 13 min. from 90 degrees there will remaine 6 degr. 47 min. as be∣fore, and soo will it bee in all the other.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>12.</HI> Chapter, Of the length and the breadth of the fixed Starres.</HEAD>
<P>THe Starres of the eigth heaven are called Fixed Starres, because (unlike the Plannets without mo∣tion) they stand alwayes fast and fixed in one fashion and distance one from the other, and are carryed about alto∣gether one with the other by the <HI>Primum Mobile:</HI> they are marked according to length and breadth. Their length is a part of the Ecliptique, contained betweene two halfe circles, going both out of the Poles of the Eclipti∣que, the one through the spring Equinoctiall, or the be∣ginning of Aries, the other through the Starres themselves. Their breadth is a Bow of the like halfe Circle betweene the Ecliptique Line and the Starres: That is two fold Northerly &amp; Southerly, the Northerly which are North∣wards from the Ecliptique, and the Southerly which stand Southward from them.</P>

The other through the Starre F devi∣ding the Ecliptique in K: that part of the Ecliptique D K is the length of such a Starre, and the Bow or part of the said halfe Circle K F is his breadth towards the North, because that it standeth by North of the Ecliptique.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>14.</HI> Chapter, Concerning the change of the declination of the fixed Starres.</HEAD>
<P>EVen as the starry heaven in our sight is driven a∣bout every 24 Howres by the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> upon the axepoints or Poles of the world from east to west: so are these also carried about upon the Poles of the Eclip∣tique Line once in 25400 yeares, on the contrary from west to east, even as the Sun once every yeare. By which the length of the Starres changeth every hondred yeares 1 degree, and 25 minutes, or else every 20 yeares 17 mi∣nutes: but their breadth that is the distance from the Ecliptique remaineth unchangeable alwayes the same. Through the foresaid change of the length (by length of time) changeth also the declination of the one more and also sooner then of the other. Some are made lesse, and some grow bigger. Some of them having Northerly de∣clination become souther, and some others having sou∣therly declination become on the contrary northerly.</P>

<P>LEt C D E bee the Equinoctiall, A the northerne and B the southerne Pole of the World G D H the E∣cliptique line N M the Poles thereof G the beginning of Capricorne. D of Aries and H the end of Gemini or beginning of Cancer, let (as is before said the Starre at F its length be in the Ecliptique to L. its breadth by north of it at L F its northerly declination is then V F. If then the foresaid starre in many yeares runneth in length from F to L paralell with D H its breadth resteth K T even untill the soregoing F L but its declination I T, is more then V F the first because that it beeing paralell with D H is more wended from the Equinoctiall line. The starre at O whose length let it bee in the Ecliptique to Q and its breadth Q O. hath southerly declination P O: but running in length from O to R pararell with Q X its breadth remaineth X R even to Q O but its southerly de¦clination R S is lesse then O P because that it beeing pa∣ralell with G D is come neerer the Equinoctiall. But if the same starre commeth to run in length unto Y its de∣clination shall bee Y Z by north the line. That is spoken of the 6 first signes ♑ ♒ ♓ ♈ ♉ ♊. In the same manner commeth to passe the contrary part in the other 6 signes ♋ ♌ ♍ ♎ ♏ and ♐ thus. In the same figure let H bee the beginning of Cancer D Libra, and G the end of Sagita∣rius.
<PB REF="10"/> If a Starre at T having Northerly declination T I runneth in length untill F, its declination F V is lesse then T I, because it is come nearer the Equinoctiall, then if so be that it runneth in length untill B, its deelination which was first northerly shall then bee southerly from B to D. Through the foresayd motions of the eigth Spheare changeth also the declination of the Northstarre, which is every yeare greater, that is, hee departeth the longer the more from the Equinoctiall, and commeth neerer the Pole, which shall endure to the yeare of our Lord 2091, then shall hee bee nearest and no more then 26 minutes, and a halfe distant from it and after that time by little and little shall wend from it, so that 12700 yeares afterwards it shall stand from the Pole 47 degrees and 56 minutes. How this commeth to passe may plainly bee conceived out of this manner of Figure.</P>

<P>Let A bee the northerne Pole of the world in the middle of the Equinoctiall B. D. F. C: N the Pole of the Ecliptique in the middle of the Ecliptique E D G C, H the North∣starre, its breadth from the Ecliptique is Q H 66 degrees and 2 minutes, and its distance from the Pole of the Zo∣diaque N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes, they remaine al∣wayes alike even as the breadth and distance of all fixed Starres from the Pole of the Zodiaque N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes they remaine alwayes one and the same even as the breadth and distance of all fixed Starres is from the Zodiaque Pole, as heretofore is sayd. Its length from the Spring Equinoctiall or beginning of Aries for the yeare 1625. is C Q 83 degrees and 24 minutes.</P>
<P>Let there bee drawne a Circle out of N the Pole of the Ecliptique, as I L K O H; whose halfe Diameter let bee N H 23 degrees and 58 minutes even to the distance of the Northstarre from the Zodiaque Pole, therein is closed the Northpole of the world at A as beeing lesse different from the Zodiaque Pole then the Northstarre. Upon the like Circle the Northstarre taketh his compasse about the Pole of the Zodiaque (even as all the fixed Starres in 25400 yeares, its distance from the worlds Pole is for the yeare 1625 A H 2 degrees 42 minutes and shall in the yeare of our Lord 2091 bee come from H to I beeing then nearest to the worlds Pole, and stands no further of then 26 ½ minut. going forwards from I alongst to L untill K it shall then bee distant from the worlds Pole marked with A K 27 degrees and 56 minutes.</P>
<P>But because the Starres keepe not alwayes one kind of declination, wee have for the furtherance of Mariners prepared these two following Tables.

Besides the declination there is adjoyned the complement of the declination that is, how wide they stand from the Pole.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>15.</HI> Chapter, how you may easily learne to know the fixed Starres and at what time every one of them commeth to the South.</HEAD>
<P>HOw needfull and profitable it is for a Sea-faring man to have knowledge of the fixed starres and their use, especially in strange voyages, and farre Navigations, that is more then well known to all experienced and under∣standing
<PB REF="11"/> Steerman: moreover, because wee have described in the foregoing chapter the declination of the fixed stares and their distance from the Pole, wee shall here shew you a way and fitting meanes how you shall easily learne to know them and that perfectly at all times when as every one of them come in the south or at their height, and are fitting to be used.</P>
<P>First you must know that the way of the Sonn in the heaven is immoveable with the fixed Starres with the which it is every day once turned about from east to west without change, but onely that the Sonne doth contrary wise run this foresayd yearely course from west to east Whereby hee in his daily course, commeth so farr behind, that hee in a whole yeare goeth one course lesse then the fixed Starres: and that the fixed Starres turne once more about in a yeare then the Sunn, so that they every day come 4 min. sooner to the division, that commeth every weeke to about halfe an houre &amp; every month 2 houres, which that it may the better bee understood, wee will make it evident by an example taken from the starre cal∣led Syrius, or Canis Major the great dogge, which alwayes followeth a little after the Image of the Gyant Orion and his Girdle, which is called the three Kings, which appeare a little over the great Dogge, it is the greatest and clearest of all the fixed Starres, which for the most part is knowne unto all Sea-faring men, his declination is Southward from the Line 16 degrees, and 13 minutes.</P>
<P>And it is south upon the 24 of Ianuary new stile, at ten of the clock at night. The 23 of Februaty at 8 of the clock at night. The 28 of March as six of the clock at night. The 30 of April at foure of the clock in the evening. The 30 of May at two of the clock afternoone. The 28 of Iune at 12, of the clock at noone, even with the Sun. The 28 of Iuly, at ten of the clocke before noone. The 29 of August at eight of the clocke before noone. The 1 of October at six of the clock in the morning. The 12 of November at foure of the clock in the morning. The 1 of December at two of the clock in the morning. The 28 of December at 12 of the clock at night.</P>
<P>Whereby every man may easily reckon at what houre and time this Starre is south every day in the yeare, as well in the day time when you cannot see it, as in the night when wee may see it. And if you desire to know the like touching all the rest of the fixed Starres upon every day in the yeare, then marke what was said before, upon what houre of the day before set downe, the great Dogge com∣meth into the South, and by the Tables hereafter follow∣ing, touching the declination of the Stars, marke how long time the Starte you seeke for, commeth into the South before or after the great Dogge, &amp; by that meanes you shall finde the just and perfect time that you desire.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 17 <HI>Point.</HI> How to find the houre of the day or of the night.</HEAD>
<P>To finde the houre of the day at any hight, will bee done most readily and certainely with such a water com∣pas, as is described in the Chapter of the ebbing &amp; flow∣ing of the Sea; in the night one may finde it by the night∣diall, as this Figure above describeth, which hath two rondels; the one moveable, the other immoveable, in the lowest which is immoveable are the 12 signes of heaven placed is also the moneths and dayes of the yeere. On the
<PB REF="13"/> moveable roundel are the houres, this turnes with the gnomen, whose right side answereth to the middle point where there must be a nayle with a hole; through which a man may see. The use of this night diall is this: We set first the foot to the twelfth houre on the moveable roundel, and to the day of the yeere, on the undermost unmovea∣ble roundel, and set the Instruments hight, with the lowest corner of the foot A B, so that it stand water-pas, in such sort, that a man may see the North-star through the hole of the nayle, turning the diall up and downe, so long till the hinder wheeles of the great Wagon come into the diall, which being so, the gnomen shall shew the houre on the moveable roundel. And if in place of the hinder wheels of the Wagon you take the brightest of the watchtmen, it will be 4 hour. 15 minut. later, as the diall will shew, because the wheeles aforesayd of the great cart goe so much before the wayters.</P>
<P>Men may finde the houre by the ascension of the Sunne and the Starres in this manner; when we see any Star in the South, whose just ascension is knowne, and that we know the true ascension that day, then draw the ascension of the Sunne from the ascension of the Star, the remain∣der we devide into houres by 15, (for 15 degr. make 1 houre) and this wil be the right houre of the time, but if the ascension of the Sunne be more then the Stars, in that cause you shall add 360 degrees to the ascension of the Star, and then to as aforesayd.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. <HI>Example.</HI></HEAD>
<P>On the 10 of April, in the evening, in the south, Ise the heart of the Lyon, whose right ascension is 147 degr. the ascension of the Sunne on that day is 19 degr. take those from the ascension of the Star, there remaines 128 degrees, and these devided by 15, I finde 8 houres, 8 de∣grees over plus, and for as much as 15 degrees make one houre, every degree will make 4 minutes, the 8 degrees over plus, make 32 minutes of an houre, it will be than at that time 8 houres, 32 minutes from the noone tyde.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II <HI>Exempel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 5 of November in the night I finde in the south the Star Aldebaran, the south eye of the Bull, whose right ascension is 64 degrees: the Sunnes right ascension on that day 220 degr. which is more then that of Aldebaran, therefore I add to the ascension of the Srar 360 degrees, it makes 424 degrees, the Sunnes right ascen∣sion being taken from this, there remains 204 degr. which is the difference betweene the ascension of the Sunne and the Star aforesaid, which being devided by 15 you shall finde 13 houres, 8 degrees, which make 36 minutes, it is then 13 houres 36 minutes from the noone tijde, that is 1 houre, 36 minut. after midnight.</P>
<P>How to finde the ascension on any day in the yeere of the Sunne and the Stars, we have here adjoyneth 2 tables, the one of the Sunne, showing from 5 dayes to 5 dayes, the Sunnes ascension, out of which you may easily finde the same in other dayes.

The Sun touching this Circle is at the highest, and then it is just noone, or the middle time of the day, and likewise the stars when they come upon this Circle, they are like the Sun) at the highest of the Horizon, and right South and as soone as they have past it they be∣gin to goe downeward againe.</P>

<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>TO find the height the Mathematicians have devised divers fit Instruments, whereof there are two that are most used at sea, which are the Astrolabium, and the com∣mon Crosse-staffe, the use of the Astrolabium is plaine and well known unto all men: for holding the instrument by the ring, let the Sun shine through the holes of the eares, the uttermost part of the Diall (counting from below up∣wards sheweth how many degrees the Sun is risen above the Horizon: as the former figure plainly sheweth.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Crosse-staffe is used thus, you must place the end of the Staffe underneath the eye, then you must remove
<PB REF="14"/> the Crosse too and fro, untill the upper end of the Crosse standeth even upon halfe the Sun or Star, and the under end just with the Horizon, and then the Crosse will shew you upon the staffe, how many degrees they are in height, so you account after those numbers whereof ninety stand that the end of the staffe that is next to your eye, the computation going backward from the other end of the staffe: for otherwise if you reckon by those numbers that proceed forward from the end next your eye, then it will shew you how many degrees the Sun or Star standeth from the Zenith, or Head point of the Horizon, as you may see by the figure ensuing.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 23 <HI>Point.</HI> How you must make a perfect Crosse-staffe, and how you shall marke it.</HEAD>
<P>THe Crosse staves are oftentimes made the one after the other by imitation, or patterns, and that many times without judgement or knowledge whether the pat∣tern bee good or not, whereof notwithstanding a man ought to bee very certaine, for it is a matter of great im∣portance and therfore I have here set downe two severall wayes easie to be understood, how to make the same ex∣quisitely and perfectly upon good reason &amp; good ground.</P>
<P>Make an even smooth board, and paste good paper upon it, then draw a strait line upon one edge or side thereof, as you see in this figure a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine marked C A D, then marke another line as you see it marked B C, that B C A bee a right and just halfe square, then take a good paire of Compasses, and set one foot thereof in the angle mark∣ed C, and compas therewith as you see B E A, so that A E B may bee a right quadrant, or fourth part of a Circle, then devide it into two parts, to E, and then devide the other halfe (which is A E) into 90 parts, or degrees as thus: first devide it into 3 parts, and then devide each 3 parts again into 3, and then it wil be divided into 9 parts, which done, devide each of them into two parts, and those divisions or parts divide into 5 parts, and then it will bee divided into 90 parts: then take a straight line? and lay the one end thereof upon the Center C, and so forth up∣on every severall point, which you have divided in the Quadrant and then draw lines from the Center C through all the foresaid points, as long as the board will containe them, as you may see in this figure: which done then your instrument is fully made and prepared to marke your staves there upon. Which to doe, with your compasses take just the half length of your Crosse, and set the one foot thereof in the Center, and put the other at F, and doe the like from D right to G, which two points or pricks draw with a straight line unto each other as you see in the line F and G, and then mark where the line F G is cut through by the lines that come out of the Center through the degrees or points of the quadrant: for those cuttings through, shew upon the said line the right marking of your Crosse-staffe: that is, you must marke your Staffe just as you see that these lines in F G are mark∣ed, by the lines that come out of the center and passe through it, whether the Crosse bee long or short, you must follow the same order that you are taught in the figure, the line H I is drawne for a shorter Crosse then the former, and K L for one that is shorter then that, viz whose halfe is just so long as the Line C K.</P>
<P>The second manner of Framing your Crosse-staffe much excelleth the ftrst in perfection and curiosity, so you di∣vide it perfectly with your Compasses, which is done in this manner. Upon an hard even board which is pasted with paper draw a straight line as long as your staffe is, and with point compasse take the just halfe or the length of your Crosse, whereunto you mean to mark your staffe, and prick it many times along in the said line as you can: &amp; divide each of the said lengths into 11000 equall parts, then look upon the table here after insuing, which shewed you how many of those points or parts you shall marke for each degree, and that you must doe in manner follow∣ing, from the end of the staffe, which you will make the eye-end pricke just the halfe length of the Crosse, and there make a Crosse stroke, from whence prick for every degree so many of the aforesaid parts as the table ensuing sheweth you. As for example, for the first degree prick 176 parts, for the second 355 parts, for the third 538 parts, for the fourth 724 parts, and so forth: Remem∣bring that you must prick all the lengths of pricks or parts aforesaid, from the aforesaid crosse stroke, which is marked upon the halfe length of the Crosse into 11000 parts, then devide the whole Crosse so, and then take for every degree halfe so many as the Table sheweth unto you. And if you cannot doe so, devide halfe the Crosse into a 1000 parts, and then leave the hindermost letter of the table out, as where you should for the first degree take an 176 parts, take but 17 parts, leaving the last figure out: but if your crosses be so smal that you can devide the halfe of them into no smaller then an hundred parts, then leave out the two last figures in the table. But you must under∣stand that the more parts that you devide the crosses into, your markes will fall out so much the better &amp; perfec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 24 <HI>Point.</HI> Of the cutting of the Crosse-staffe, and how a man may helpe and prevent all the defects of the staffe.</HEAD>
<P>THere being a Crosse-staffe well and exquisitely fra∣med, according to the doctrine of the former Chap∣ter: it falleth out, that certaine ignorant persens cutoff a peece from the eye end of the Staffe, about a degree or a degree and a halfe, or two degrees long, and can give no other reason of that their doing but that it must be so, and that they have experience that it ought so to be. But
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> questionlesse, seeing they prove by their experience that they doe not find their measuring with uncutt staves per∣fect &amp; right as it should bee, the fault thereof, is not in the Crosse staves uncut, but in themselves, for that they know not how to use the staffe aright, nor understand the true ground thereof. Others that wil seeme wiser than the for∣mer, give a reason thereof: to wit, that the staffe must be cut, because of the hollownesse of the eye, for that other∣wise the staffe cannot come to stand, so that the end thereof bee conjoyned to the middle point or center of the eye or sight, this reason hath some show of truth, but notwithstanding is alike untrue and erroneous: for the staffe may very wel bee set, either on the innermost or outermost corner of the eye, so that the sight of the eye may fall to answer just to the end of the staffe: that this is truth we will prove with good reason as followeth,</P>
<P>Set the great Crosse with the middlemost upon like de∣grees to wit, each upon such as for that purpose are mark∣ed upon the staffe: then apply the staffe (the Crosses so firmely remaining) unto your eye in such manner (whether it bee on the innermost or outermost corner it is all one) as that you discerne the ends of the Crosses both above and beneath, just over each other, in forme as this figure specifieth. If then you draw strait lines by the ends of of the Crosses A B and D C they shall meet just in the middle point of your sight. And in asmuch as the Crosses are placed upon like degrees, the lines aforesaid shall meet just upon the end of the staffe, seeing that the end of the staffe representeth the center of the quadrant whereby your staffe is marked.</P>
<P>So then the aforesaid lines or ends of the Crosses answer both just upon the end of the staffe, &amp; also upon the sight, so that it followeth necessarily, and appeareth evidently: that the end of the staffe and the sight meet in one; or to speake properly, both of them stand just in the center of the quadrant.</P>
<P>Therefore whensoever with the Crosse staffe you will take the height of the Sun, or of any Star, then observe diligently: how many degrees it is elevated above the Ho∣rizon: and place the two Crosses upon so many degrees: then apply the staffe to your eye in such manner as that you may see the ends of the Crosses just over each other, according as is taught before: in such forme then as you finde the staffe to stand to your eye shall you place the staffe (taking away one of the Crosses) when you desire to measure according to such height: this is a sure rule which will never fayle, neither can you possibly misse if you follow it.</P>

<P>The common Crosse staffe is a very fit instrument to take the height at Sea, as well of the Sunne, as of other stars, but if the Sunne bee very high, wee can not use it so commodiously, because the eye can hardly indure the heath and brightnesse of it. To avoid this, wee may very conveniently take the height of the Sun by the shaddow, in this manner: make a peece or staffe 3 or foure feet long, very smooth, halfe a thumme thicke, broad two or 3 thummes, that it may remaine straight, as you see in A B in the midst of the broad side (just at the halfe be∣tweene the upper and nether edge line, draw aright) C D,

Make an∣other peece like H, and in the middest of the same also a hole for the eye like K, and an hole thwart like I, that so it may be put on the end of the staffe at B, in such manner that it stand not right, but thwart or corner wise, as the line B D L sheweth, and that the hole K, may stand like the other eyehole G, on the peece E) neither higher nor lower then the line C D, just by the point D, or else you may in place of that eye hole, cut off the Crosse of the lower edge to the line where the eye-hole standeth, (as you may see in the Crosse S) at the line XV. make ano∣ther Crosse, a foot and a halfe or two foot long, in the forme of M N, with a hole at N, through which it being put into the foresaid peece, that so you may slide it, to and againe, and that it may goe softly and certaine on it, then make in the lower part of the hole a brasen scrue which may bee thrust under against the peece and shuft it close to O P. Last of all, make a smal Crosse as Q, with an hole that it may be set on the long Crosse M N, and fa∣sten it behinde with a scrue so high or low as use requi∣reth, in the end toward the fore part make a flat eare, an

</FIGURE> inch, or an inch and a halfe broad like R S, neither right nor flat but thwartwise or cornerwise, so that when all these parts are joyned together as they ought, the flat of that eare, and that thwart flat of the sliding-peece H, may allway remaine at like distance, that is, that they make equall angles, or that they both may stand the one and the other out of the square against the peece A B, the parts thus prepared, and joyned to each other, the forme of this instrument will be like the figure which is marked N. 2. now to marke this staffe fit for use doe thus; make an even board about the breadth of the length of the long crosse, and as long as the peece A B, paest on good paper, in the one corner, draw a straight line like this figure the line A B C, take a paire of compasse and set the one foot in the point A, and with the other make part of a circle, as wide as the board will permit, like B D E F; keepe the compasse open, and set one foot in B, and the other in the circle drawne, as farre as it will reach, as in E, divide the circle B E into equall parts in D, thrust the white B D, or D E, from E, forward alongst the circle to
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> F, then drow a line from F, to A, the angle F A B is a just triangle, and the bow B D E F is a just quadrant or fourth part of a circle, the parts B D, D E, E F, divide each in three parts, againe into five, soo shall the qua∣drant bee divided into 90 gr. You may divide into lesse as halfes, thirds, fourths, if you will. The quadrant being thus divided, lay a ruler, on the end A, &amp; the other end on the point of the other divisions, &amp; so draw lines from the point A, through al the other points, as long as they may stand on the board, as is to be seene in the figure above.</P>
<PB REF="17"/>
<P>That being done, the preparation is made; to marke the peece, take first the just widenesse with a paire of Com∣passes, that is betweene EG, the foremost edge of the long crosse, and A B the outermost edge of the eare, in the little crosse, as in the figure N<SUP>o</SUP>. 2. and put that on the peece of the point D, on the left roundell inward toward C, on that point draw a thwart line, from thence you shall be∣gin to marke, that the widenesse betweene the middle line of the staffe, and the under edge of the eare, which is in the uppermost crosse, as in the foresaid figure N<SUP>o</SUP>. 2. from F tot A, prick that on the quadrant from A toward F in H, and from C to G in I, and draw the line H I. Then ob∣serve how all the lines comming from A the center of the quadrant, cutting through this line, even so must the peece bee marked beginning at the point C with 90, 80, 70, &amp;c. But if so doing, you cannot get so many degrees on the staffe, as you desire to have (for your use) then set the little crosse a third or fourth part lower toward the great crosse at your pleasere, so that the under edge of the eare AB in the figure N<SUP>o</SUP>. 2. may come to stand at MN, then in the place of the length F A take F M, and thrust it in the quadrant of A toward F into K, and from C unto L, and draw the line K L, that then will bee marked as it ought, by cutting the lines, comming from the center through the devision of the quadrant, but you must take a certaine marke in the long crosse, for to set the little crosse in such manner as you would use both marking. But if you would make more markes on the same peece, you must slide that little crosse more netherward and then doe as was said before, but you may not forget to make cer∣taine markes in the long crosse; for to set the little crosse wel according to the marking, which you desire to use.</P>
<P>To marke this crosse staffe from tables more perfectly, draw on an even board pasted with paper a right or straight line, as long or longer then the staffe that you de∣sire to marke. You shall with the compasse take the wide∣nesse of the staffe, between the middle line, and the ne∣thermost edge of the eare at the little crosse, as it is in the figure N<SUP>o</SUP>. 2. F A or F M, or also F O, what marking soever you desire to follow set that widenesse taken as often alongst that foresaid line as you can, and each of these lengths you shall divide in 10000 parts, this table in this place shewes how many of these parts you shall appoint for a degree, or a fourth part of a degree, beginning, as is the figure a foresayd N<SUP>o</SUP>. 2. from the point C. The first Columne of the table sheweth the degrees, the second the min. the third the parts, which you must take for the degrees, and mi. for the first halfe degree or 30 min. 87, for a degrees, 175. for 2 degr. 15 mi. 393, but for 6. degrees, 45. min. 1184. parts; but if you cannot divide so small a breadth as of F E, or F O, into 10000 parts, then you may divide it into halfe so many parts, and so you shall take so many parts for a degree, or part of a degree, if you cannot doe that, you shall devide it into 1000 parts, at every time, leaving out one letter in the table, as when you should take for the first degree 175. take 17, and as neare, as you can one halfe, for the 8, degrees in the place of 1405, take 140, and so forward.</P>
<P>Lastly, draw two parrallel lines, on the least roundell standing on the outermost end of the staffe, which may be perfectly seene, whereof the one must goe through the midst of the eyhole as O P, the other so much higher that the breadth of the eare at the little roundell Q R if you make a good breadth betweene these two lines of like widenesse. it will be so much the more serviceable for use; this crosse staf being thus compleately made. The use of it to take the height is this: you shall set it with the back toward the Sunne (as you see in this figure here beneath) and looke through the sight of the moveable runpeece, then shall you likewise see the Horizon through the ey∣hole of the least unmoveable peece, and keepe that as straight as you can, but if you use a crosse as in the figure N<SUP>o</SUP>. 1. is marked with S. then you shal hold the lower edge VX. right on the Horizon, as you doe in the common
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> crosse staffe. Then yon shall slide with your hand the long crosse to and fro upon the staffe, untill the shadow of the eare at the uppermost little crosse fall into the open field, on the least unmoveable thin peece on the end of the staffe, just between the two parrallel lines above the sight hole, to wit in such manner; that you may at oncesee the
<PB REF="17"/> Horizon through both the sight holes, and the shaddow of the above-said eare even above the two foresayd par∣rallel lines that being once obtained, the great crosse will stand just by the degree of the true height of the Sunne, to wit, according to such marking as the uppermost little crosse (being high or low) is set.</P>
<P>Having found the height of the Sunne, if the declina∣nation be northerly, you shall substract it from the height found, that is to say, if you are in the northside of the Sunne, that is if the Sunne be southerly, but if the decli∣nation be southerly, then you adde it to the height found, and so you shall finde the height of the Equinoctiall, which being taken from 90, you shall finde the height of the Pole, as by example: Let the Sunne, as in the figure here by standing, bee elevated above the Horizon B D 70, de∣grees, the northerly declination E D 10 degrees; If you
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> take these from B D 70 degrees, there remaines 6 de∣grees, the height of the Equinoctiall, this being taken from B Z, or E G 90, there remaines E Z, or B G thirty, just at P A the corner of the Pole.</P>
<P>But if you marke this staffe with the number inverted, so that in the place of 90 you set 0 for 80. 10 for 70 20. and so forth, as the common crosse staffe is marked ordi∣narily, which you use toward the Sunne, you must then on the contrary use the northerly declination, and sub∣stract the southerly and so at the first without further marking, you have the height as it is in the figure, if as in that which went before you to the height of the Sun being elevated at D 70 gr. you shall in place 70 finde on the staffe 20 that is not the height of the Sun from the Horizon B D, but the fulfilling of the height to 90 degrees as D Z, that is the distance of the Sun and Zenith, if then you joine to it the northerly declination D E 10 gr. that makes together EZ 30 degrees, the distance of the Equi∣noctiall and Zenith, and just at P A the elevation of the Pole. In the same manner if the Sun hath southerly de∣clination, and is risen from the Horizon 50. gr. as in S. you shall not find on the staffe 50 gr. for B S, but 40. gr. for S Z the distance of the Sunne and the Zenith. Then if you take S E the southerly declination from S Z 40. there remains E Z 30 degrees, for the distance of the Equi∣noctiall and the Zenith just at P A the height of the Pole.</P>
<P>That the unsliding peece should be moveable by the sight it is done for 2. causes; first that you may slide it ne∣therward or outward as these and sliding of the great crosse requireth, secondly, that in soule weather when the waves goe high, you may set it inward (as occasion shall require) for your better measuring, for where the waves are high and troublesom long instruments, are not so fit for use as short. This foresaid crosse staffe is very fit, to take the height certainely on the firm land, without the use of the Horizon. That you may do this, you shall lay the staffe on a table or any other flat place in a rightline with the water the eye end directly to the south, and with the other end, where the thwart sliding peece standeth to the north, on two smooth peeces of wood, so much lifted up that you may slide the long crosse too and againe with∣out hinderance, then when the Sunne comes directly south, (that is, when the Sunne hath equall shadow on each side of the staffe, then shall you slide the long crosse too and fro, so long untill the shadow of the eare at the lit∣tle crosse fall just betweene the two parrallell lines on the thwart crosse; that being done, you shall finde the height of the Sun in the staffe at the long crosse, which being sound, you shall by that know the height of the Pole or the distance of the place where you take the height ac∣cording to the instructions before laid downe.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 26. <HI>Point.</HI> Concerning the use of the searing.</HEAD>
<P>THe Astrolabiums which men now a dayes common∣ly use at Sea, I meane that with a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>optra, upon which stand two penullen, &amp; are not verry serviceable by reason of the continuall motions of the ships to bee used at sea unlesse the penullen upon the Dioptra are placed neere by one another, for then the Shipmaisters some times use the Astrolabium in the measuring of the Sonne. Neverthelesse the Astrolabium can have no such perfe∣ction in it, for the Dioptra in the said Astrolabiums are placed almost 2 or 3 inches at most the one from the other, and if so bee, in a little time, a small fault or mistake happen in the observation of the shaddows even as through motion of the shipp it may easily happen, soo also must the Dioptra upon the degrees of the Limbus make a greater mistake and fault.</P>
<P>Therefore have I here set downe this figured and drawne Ring which you may let be made ready or prepared by Messig about one foote or a foote &amp; halfe wide and 2 or 3 inches broad. For in the use of it you have no neede of a Dioptra but you let the Sonne shine through the little holes because the shaddow may the more perfectly and narrowly bee observed, so! then let the ring b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> covered on both sides onely that there may bee some opening left that so the degrees which stand marked on the inside may bee fitly seene and used.</P>
<P>These degrees fall once more wider one from the other then in the Limbus of the Astrolabium, because in this the shadow falleth out of the circumference; or out of the sides and not (as it is in the Astrolabium) out of the Center, and therefore is the whole circumference of the Ring ac∣cording to the Art of Geometry devided into 180 de∣grees, whereas on the contrary in the Astrolabium the Limbus or round ring encompassing it containeth 360 de∣grees.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The beginning of the degrees beginneth by the letter O, right even against the little hole over that which is placed next by the handel: there are 2 little holes or chinkes made in the Ring through which you let the shad∣dow fall, the one stands by the letter B, placed about 10 degr. from the pendel E, by which the ring is hung. The other little hole C. stands just 30 degrees distant from the little hole. B. Because: when the Sunne is not verry high above the Horison, then we receive the shaddow through the little hole C, and then wee begin to count the degrees not farre from the letter O, as beforesaid, but from the letter F, standing right just over against C. just 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> degrees distant from O.</P>
<P>This ring being thus made I should thinke it most fitting to signify the hight of the Sunne, notwithstan∣ding the Shipmaisters now adayes use the degree-bow, which neverthelesse are great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly subject to faults and mistakes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 27. <HI>Point.</HI> Of the breadth of the Lands.</HEAD>
<P>THe breadth of Lands or Countries is no other, then the distance or widenesse that is betweene the said Lands and the Equinoctiall Line, which is reckoned in a double manner, that is northerly and southerly, to the number of 90. Such Lands or Countries as lye right un∣der the Equinoctiall Line have no breadth: but such as lye northward from it, have northerly breadth, and they that lye southerly have southerly breadth.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>The Iland of S. Thomas, in the River Gaban in Guiena lyeth right under the Line, and therefore hath no breadth neither northerly nor southerly.</P>
<P>The Cape S. Vincent in Spaine lyeth northward from the Line 37 degrees, and therfore the northern breadth of Cape S. Vincent is 37 degrees.</P>
<P>The point of Lizart in England lyeth northward from the Line 50 degrees, therefore the north breadth of Li∣zart is 50 degrees.</P>
<P>The Cape de Bona Esperance lyeth southward from the Line 34 degrees and a halfe, therefore the southerly breadth of Capa de Bona Esperance is 34 degrees and a halfe. In like manner you must understand and reckon their Lands, Countries and Townes.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 28. <HI>Point.</HI> Of the height of Lands and Countries, and what it is.</HEAD>
<P>THe height and breadth of Lands and Countreyes although that in themselves they are divers things, yet they are allwayes one like unto the other. Any Coun∣trey being scituated under the breadth of 30 degrees, lyeth also in the height 30 degrees, which by Sea-faring men is taken without difference, but what it is, or what it hath in it or signifieth few men understand, and yet it behooveth a seafaring man, that seeketh for the height of any Coun∣tries, to bee expert therein, for that no man without it can wel understand how many instruments (whether it be Astrolabium, or Crosse staffe, no nor the Sea-compasse it selfe) should well be used: for that these things are all built upon one foundation, and like a chaine hang one up∣on the other. But it may be that some man will object and say, that there are many Pilots which doe not well under∣stand such things and yet are able to goe directly unto divers places, whether they desire to sayle: which I con∣fesse to be true: but tell me how many times are they de∣ceived? How many times are they in great doubt &amp; feare? and how seldome dare they trust unto the height which they have taken or reckoned, when they are to seeke out any Countrey thereby? how oftentimes hath it heretofore happened, that for want of such knowledge, shippes have sayled out of their way either, behinde England, or upon France, which thought to passe through the chanell be∣tween England and France, and that in so short and well knowne, and common sayled water, as to come out of Spaine or France? what would such men doe, if they should passe the Line, and were to seeke or finde out cer∣taine Ilands? Or that after they had sayled up and downe the Seas certaine moneths together, should then seeke out for Land? but I am of this opinion which I know eve∣ry man will grant that it is much better and more assured to goe away being guided by his owne eye-sight, then like a blinde man to bee led by another, and knoweth not whether that other seeth well or not: but to come againe to our matter, touching the height of Countries, it is no other but the height of the Pole above the Horizon, that is to say, so many degrees as the Pole in any Land is lifted up above the Horizon; so much is the height of such a Country: &amp; this height agreeth allwayes with the breadth as aforesayd. In the 10 Chapter it is shewed, that where∣soever a man goeth or turneth, alwayes the one halfe of the Heavens sheweth it selfe above the Horizon and the other halfe is hidden from us: in the first chapter it is said
<PB REF="19"/> that the two Poles stand right one against the other, whereby it is evidently to be understood, that whensoever a man being upon the earth is right under the Equinoctiall line, that then both the Poles of the World, lye right in the Horizon, one in the south, and the other in the north: and as much as a man travaileth northward from the Equinoctiall line; and winneth breadth northerly, so much the north Pole riseth above the Horizon: and the south Pole contrarywise goeth so much under: and on the con∣trary, as many degrees as a man goeth from the Equino∣ctiall line southward, and winneth breadth southward, so much the south Pole riseth above the Horizon, and the north Pole goeth so much under: which may easily be un∣derstood by the figure here after following.</P>
<P>In this figure the innermost roundel that turneth about, signifieth the Heaven, N the north Pole, S the south Pole, AE the Equinoctiall, the uppermost edge of the halfe moveable roundell, signifieth the Horizon, the one halfe off the Heavens is above it, and the other halfe just under it, the round ball in the middle signifieth the earth, where in you see a little man, that may be turned upon the earth southward and northward.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Now perfectly to marke and perceive that which is before written, that is to know what height is, and that it alwayes agreeth with the breadth, bring the little man upon the Earth Globe right under the Equinoctiall, that is to say that it have no breadth, neither northward nor southward, then you shall see that both the Poles lye just with the Horizon, and that neither of them both are ele∣vated above it, nor depressed under it, and withall, you shall see that they that dwell under the Equinoctiall have no height or elevation of the Pole, nor yet any breadth. But if you remove the man so much northward that hee goeth tenne degrees upon the earth, that is, that hee commeth tenne degrees upon the north breadth, you shall see that the north Pole shall bee raysed or elevated tenne degrees above the Horizon in the north, and the south Pole shall goe ten degrees under the Horizon: and if you remove the man upon the earth more northerly, as thirty, forty, or fifty degrees, the north Pole will also be so much elevated, and the south Pole to the contrary so much de∣pressed under the Horizon: so that if you turne the man upon the earth to ninety degrees, then the north Pole also will bee elevated ninety degrees, that is the Pole will stand right above his head, and the Equinoctiall will joyne with the Horizon in one circle: that which thus is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id of the elevating of the north Pole, is also in the same manner to be understood of the south Pole: for if you likewise move the man upon the earth in the figure toward the south, the south Pole will be elevated above the Horizon, as much as the man in breadth goeth southward, and the north P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le will goe so much under the Horizon.</P>
<P>One thing is herein to be noted, that as much as the Pole riseth above the Horizon just so much the Equino∣ctiall goeth under it, and when the Pole goeth under, the Equinoctiall riseth againe in equall proportion.</P>
<P>But above all you must marke, that the number of the Poles elevation added to the height of the Equinoctiall al∣wayes make even ninety degrees, so that when the Pole is elevated 30 degrees in the north, the Equinoctiall is ele∣vated sixty degrees in the south: but if the south Pole bee elevated above your Horizon twenty degrees, the Equinoctiall will bee elevated in the north seventy de∣grees, which is clearly understood and shewed in this manner: we alwayes see halfe the Heavens above the Ho∣rizon, (as aforesaid) which is twice ninety degrees, from the south to the Zenith or the point just over our heads, and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Zenith to the Horizon in the north. Now seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> betweene the Equinoctiall and the Pole there are alwayes ninety degrees, (as is shewed in the second chapter) it followeth that which is beneath the Pole and the Equinoctiall, maketh also ninety degrees: therefore when we know the height of the Equinoctiall, and take it out of ninety, that which resteth over is alwayes the
<PB REF="19"/> height of the pole, this also may bee seene in the figure aforesaid.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 29. <HI>Point.</HI> Concerning the difference and agreement of the Declination in divers places of the earth.</HEAD>
<P>THese Tables of the Suns declination are reckoned upon the Meridian or length of the earth from the westend of England. Those which are more easterly from thence, have the lesser declination, when the Sun depart∣eth from the Line, and increaseth in declination either towards the North or South as wel betweene the 20 of March, and the 22 of Iune, as betweene the 23 of Sep∣tember, and the 22 of December, and the greater declina∣tion, when the Sun returneth againe towards the Line, whether it bee by north or by south the Line as wel be∣tweene the 22 of December, and the 20 of March, as be∣tweene the 22 of Iune, and the 23 of December.</P>
<P>On the contrary, those which are more westerly from thence, have the waxing declination (that is when the Sun runneth from the Line either by North or by South the Line, the greater declination and the falling declination (that is when the Sunne runneth againe towards the Line, either by North or by South the Line, maketh the lesse. That commeth to passe by reason of time, thus. Those which are more easterly have the Sunne sooner in the south or in their Meridian, and therefore is the waxing de∣clination lesse, and the falling greater, on the contrary those which are more westerly have the Sonne later in the South, and therefore have they the increasing decli∣nation more, the decreasing lesse.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first Example.</HEAD>
<P>Concerning those which are more easterly with rising declination upon the 25 of March in the second yeare following the Leap-yeare I desire to know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Sonnes de∣clination at noone at Bantam in the East-Indies. First I seeke upon a Globe or any other Table, how much more Easterly Bantam lyeth then the Lands end of England, and I find it to bee about 120 degrees (herein wee reckon not so neare upon a degree or two, because such a diffe∣rence is but little in this respect) whilst then the Sonne must have 24 houres to run about the heaven or the whole earth which is 360 degrees, I seeke how much time hee must have to run 120 degrees, and I say thus: 360 de∣grees ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 24 houres, what maketh then 120, facit 8 houres, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thence I find that the Sunne commeth 8 houres sooner to the South at Bantam then at the Lands end of England that is: That the Sunne is fall South at Bantam, when it is but 4 a clock after midnight at En∣glands Lands end. Then I looke in these Tables upon the abovewritten 25 of March for the declination of the Sun, and I find it to bee 1 degree 57 minutes, and (out of the declination on the day following 2 degrees 21 minutes) that the declination of the Sun at that time in 24 houres increaseth 24 minutes, therefore say I: if the declination increase 24 minutes in 24 houres how much in 8 houres? facit 8 minutes, from thence it is cleare that seeing the Sun runneth from the Meridian over Bantam to the Me∣ridian of Englands end, and the declination riseth or in∣creaseth 8 minutes, that it at Bantam is 8 minutes lesse as these Tables declare. The Suns declination is that day at Bantam no more then 1 degree and 49 minutes by north the Line.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>The Second Example.</HI> With falling Declination.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the 16 of the same yeare I desire to know the Suns declination at noone) at Bantam and I find in these Tables upon that day for the length of England Lands end 2 degrees 40 minutes, that it decreaseth every day at that time of the yeare 24 minutes. Seeing then the Sun (as is sayd in the first example) cometh 8 houres sooner to the South at Bantam then at Englands end, I say doth the declination decrease 24 minutes in 24 houres, how much maketh it in 8 houres? it maketh 8 minutes from thence it is knowne, that seeing the Sonne runneth from the Meridian of Bantam to that of Englands End, and the declination falleth 8 minutes, and therefore at Ban∣tam is it 8 minutes more, even as these Tables declare. The declination of the Sonne on that day is at Bantam 2 degrees and 48 minutes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Observation.</HEAD>
<P>From hence it followeth: That one and the same Steer∣man (sayling eastwards to the Indies, comming upon two such divers times before the Straite of Sunda, and would take the height of the Pole according to the Sun of one and the same corner of Land, and should use these Ta∣bles without such caution, hee should (though hee thought it wel done) thereby (taking one time 8 minutes soo much and the other time 8 minutes too little declina∣tion) hee should find it to differ 16 minutes in his height, therefore in long voyages you must thinke wel upon this.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>The third Example.</HI> Concerning those which are more Westerly with rising declination.</HEAD>
<P>A certaine Ship comming upon the 9 of October in the third yeare after Leape-yeare upon the greate South Sea, neare the Coast of Peru, the Steerman desireth to know the Suns declination there at noone, hee findeth (out of a Globe or any other Table) that that Coast lyeth full 80 degrees more Westerly then Englands Lands End. The Sun must then run from the South over Englands end to the South of the foresaid Coast of Peru full 80 degrees, to which hee requireth about 5 houres and an halfe, so that when the Sun standeth there in the South, it is then from Englands end halfe an houre past 5 in the afternone. Hee findeth in these Tables the declination of that day 6 degrees 13 minutes by South the Line, and (out of that of the following day which is 6 degrees 36 minutes) that at that time in 24 houres the declination riseth 23 min.) therefore shall hee say: the declination riseth in 24 houres 33 minutes, how much then in 5 houres and a ½? facit full 5 minutes, and from thence wee find, that seeing the Sun running from the Meridian of Englands end to hert of the Coast of Peru riseth full 5 minutes, and thereupon the declination on that day is there 5 minutes more, even as the tables demonstrate. The declination then on that day on the Coast of Peru is 6 degrees 18 minutes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>The fourth Example.</HI> Concerning the falling declination.</HEAD>
<P>Suppose that such commeth to passe on the foresaid Coast of Peru on the 8 of September the same yeare, these tables point at the declination of that day 5 degrees 46 minutes, and the day following 5 degrees 23 minutes, so as upon that time of the yeare in 24 houres time the declination lesseneth 23 minutes. The Steerman shal then reckon thus, if in 24 houres the declination lesseneth 23 minutes, how much is that in 5 houres and a halfe, facit full 5 minutes; and shall from thence find that his declina∣tion is there 5 minutes lesse, as these Tables instruct, the Sonnes declination then upon that day is upon the Coast of Peru 5 degrees 42 minutes, from hence may bee under∣stood, what it is which before is said in the example of the more easterly, that a Steereman whe would looke after the Sun on the Coast of Peru upon such two divers times in the same place, and would use these Tables of decli∣nation without the foresaid care and caution, though hee sayle right and well should neverthelesse find 10 minutes difference.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The fifth Example.</HEAD>
<P>Suppose 2 Ships beeing together depart from these Lands, the one sayleth eastwards, and commeth accord∣ing to his reckoning upon the 26 of September in the first yeare following the Leap-yeare on the other side of the world, I suppose 180 degre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, in longitude distant from Englands end, and find in these Tables the declination of
<PB REF="20"/> the Sun on that day 2 degrees 0 minutes. The other ship sayleth westwards, and meeteth the first shipp at the fore∣said place according to this reckoning not upon the 26 of September but upon the 25, and findeth the declination in these Tables for that day 1 degree 24 minutes, and so differ as wel in the time one day, and accordinglly in the declination 24 minutes, which commeth to passe from this, the first sailed towards the Sunrising 180 degrees, hath shortened his time 12 houres. The other sayled with the Sonne 180 degrees, hath lengthened his time 12 houres, &amp; thereby hath had one night lesse then the other whilst then the declination at that time increaseth in one day 24 minutes, soo must hee that is sayled eastwards reckon 12 minutes declination lesse, and hee that is sayled westwards must reckon 12 minutes more, as the Tables each and shal have one sort of declination to wit 1 deg. 12 m. haved.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 30. <HI>Point.</HI> How to finde the height of the Pole by the Sunne.</HEAD>
<P>TO find the height of the Pole by the Sunne, one thing is specially to bee marked, to wit, whether you are northward or southward from the Sunne, whether the Sunne standeth northward or southward from you is easily knowne, when you are in such a place upon the earth as is farre from the Line, or from the Sunne, but when the Sunne is neare almost above your head, then you cannot wel see it with your eye, therefore set a com∣passe before you that you may see where north and south is, then take your Astrolabium, and set it so that the one edge thereof stand right south, and the other north, and then you shall see at a hayres breadth, whether the Sunne being at the height, standeth northward or southward from the head point or Zenith: if then you will seeke the height of the Pole, when you are on the north side of the Sunne, that is, when the Sunne is Southward from you, then take the just height first, and as much as the declina∣tion of the Sunne is northward, take it out of your height and that which resteth is the height of the Equinoctiall in the south, which substracted out of ninety (as in the for∣mer Point is declared) then you have the height of the north Pole.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>In this figure let P be the north Pole, and G the South Pole, E H the Equinoctiall, A B the Horizon, Z the Ze∣nith, and D the Sun: let the height of the Sun B D bee sixty degrees above the Horizon: the northerly declina∣tion D E 8 degrees: if then you take D E 8 degrees from B D the height of the Sunne, there will rest B E 52 de∣grees, which is the height of the Equinoctiall, which ta∣ken out of 90 degrees, resteth 38 degrees, for the height of the north Pole A P, as in the 7 Point is shewed.</P>
<P>If the declination be Southerly, then adde unto the height aforesaid taken: and then if the addition bee lesse then 90, then looke upon the height of the Line in the south which taken out of 90, as aforesaid, it leaveth you the height of the North Pole.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>Let the height of the Sun be D B 40 degrees, the sou∣therly declination of the Sun E D 20 degrees, then adde E D 20 degrees, to D B 40 degrees, it maketh E B 60 de∣grees the height of the Equinoctiall which substracted from 90, as E G the distance betweene the Equinoctiall and de south Pole; then there will rest 30 for G B, that is, as much as the south Pole is gone under the Horizon: as before is shewed, so much as the one Pole is under the Ho∣rizon, just so much is the other above it, the north Pole P shall here be elevated thirty degrees.</P>
<P>But if the height of the Sunne being added unto the de∣clination maketh more then 90 degrees, then you must un∣derstand, that the Equinoctiall is northward from your head just so much as the aforesaid addition is more then 90 and so consequently the South Pole also shall bee so much elevated.</P>

<P>Suppose that you finde the height off the Sunne above the Horizon to bee 90 degrees, and that it is declined to∣ward the north 16 degrees, then are you also 16 degrees northward from the Line, and the north Pole shall bee so much elevated.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 31. <HI>Point.</HI> How to find the height of the Pole by the Starres.</HEAD>
<P>TO find the height by the Starres which stand neere the Equinoctiall, you use them either substracting from or adding thereto their declination, as you doe with the Sonne. And those which stand neere the Poles you must either substract from or adde to their distances from the Pole to their measured height and so find out the height of the Pole.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The First Example.</HEAD>
<P>Let A B bee the Horizon, P the North Pole, E D the Equinoctiall, S the northstarre standing under the Pole, I measure the height of the Northstarre S B, above the Horizon 46 degrees, and for it I find in the Table the di∣stance of the Northstarre from the Pole P S, 2 degrees 42 minutes, adding this then to the height that I find B S and maketh together 48 degrees 42 minutes for P B the height of the Pole.</P>

</FIGURE> If you come by Southwards the Line, and will use the Starres neere the Northpole, so may you substract the height (which you find) from the distance of the Starre from the Pole, and to find the depth of the North Pole under the Horizon, even to the height of the South Pole above it.</P>

<HEAD>The third Example.</HEAD>
<P>Let S bee the northermost hinder wheele of the greate wagon, his height above the Horizon in the North B S 20 degrees, which beeing substracted from S P, which is 26 degrees and 14 minutes beeing his distance from the Pole, here remaineth over B P 6 degrees 14 min. which the North Pole is sunke under the Horizon and to G A the height of the Southerne Pole.</P>
<P>Even as the southerne Starres beeing full south are at the highest, so are likewise the Northerne in the north rightabove the Pole at the highest, or under the Pole at the lowest, this you may well neare see by your eye in many which stand some what farre distant from the Pole, too wit, when they stand either above or below the Northstarre, but not right against it, by reason that the Northstarre it selfe by it owne turning about the Pole, wendeth either on one side or other some what from full North, soo that when you draw nearer the North, you must still bee measuring to find out the right highest or lowest.</P>
<P>Now to know when the Northstarre is either at his highest or lowest pitch, still marke well the greate wagon, when that commeth under the Northstarre, so that when you let a plummet line hang right against the northstarre, it may likewise come to hang in the middle betweene the Wagon and the horses, then is the Northstarre right at his highest, above the Pole. Or when the Wagon also com∣meth above the Northstarre, and when you let a plum∣met line hang through betweene the Wagon and the horses, that that also hangeth right against the North∣starre, then is the Northstarre right under the Pole at the lowest, even as standeth delineated in the following Figures.</P>

Is it higher, then you must substract from, but is it not lower you must adde that to the measured height, and soo come to find the right height of the Pole.</P>
<P>These foresaid Tables are reckoned all from 10 degrees to 10, and when you are betweene such heights soo shall you (comming upon other heights) take notice, how ma∣ny degrees you are either above or under these reckoned Poles. And therewithall how greate the difference is be∣tween such two, seeing wee find, that have observed it, you take from the difference according to the reason of the height where you are, lesse or more from the foresaid numbers, adding that too or substracting from, even as the cause requireth.</P>

<HEAD>The use of the foresaid Tables of the Elevation.</HEAD>
<P>IF you measure the Sonnes height above the Horison lesse then 32 degrees you must substract soo much as the Table teacheth you on the number of the height you have found: If you measure the distance of the Sonne from the Zenith more then 58. on the contrary you shall adde as much too as the Table besides the sup∣pliment to 90 from the measured distance from the Ze∣nith, teacheth. But the Sunne being more then 40 de∣grees above the Horison and 50 degrees from the Ze∣nith, these exaltations and elevations come to nothing.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>The first Example.</HEAD>
<P>I measure the height of the Sonne above the Hori∣zon 4 degrees, the Table of Elevations of the Sonne pointeth mee the Sonne to appeare 15 minutes higher then in truth it is, &amp; draw then those 15 minutes off from my measured height, &amp; I doe keepe for the true height of the Sunne 3 degree 45 minutes.</P>

<HEAD>The Second Example.</HEAD>
<P>I measure the distance of the Sunne from the Zenith 74 degrees, the suppliment thereof to 90 is 16 degrees thereby in the Table of the Sonne, I find 7 minutes which I adde to the distance I measured and soo I find for the right distance 74 degrees 7 minutes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 33. <HI>Point.</HI> Of the CARD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is knowne to every man, especially to those that derstand the grounds of Cosmographie, that the
<PB REF="25"/> earth with the waters make one compleate round body, &amp; therefore it cannot be, that you should set forth the same perfectly in a plane or Carde (either in the hole or in part) but there will bee some want, for it is unpossible to make a plaine agree with a round forme in all the parts thereof. So that your common cardes many times fayle in truth, especiall those that comprehend great and long voyages by sea, and far from the Equinoctiall; but the Maps which are commonly used in this Countrey, of the Easterly and Westerly Navigation, are without fault, or at least the er∣rors are so little that they hinder not.</P>
<P>They are very fit instruments to bee used at sea, and our forefathers, which have invented them, have brought no small profit and utility to Mariners. The fault of them consists in this, and thus it may bee seene: If you would sayle a triangle, the 2 first sides will bee sayled on their strokes and distances; but from the 2 to the 3 place (that is the 3 side of the triangle) it will fayle both on the strokes and distances.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>I sayle from the Lizard a straight course to the Ilands of Canary, and from thence againe to the Ilands of Corvo and Flores, on which foresayd stroks and distances many Maps are very complete and perfect. But if I would sayle againe from Corvo to the Lizard, from whence I first sailed, the Card will shew mee an imperfect way, to wit, it will seeme farther wide in the Card, then indeed it is, also it will differ on the points of the Compasse: so that you must direct your course more northerly then that which your Card directeth.</P>
<P>In soo short a journey, as this above said, it is not much observed, neither is it worth the observation: but those that sail to the West-Indies, shall soone perceive it; when they set sayle, they take their course far to the south, and there they finde their Cards of a fit length, because the Cards are fitted to it; But in their returne, when they take their course northward, they finde the way much shorter then their Cardes shew them.</P>
<P>This is the cause: All the lines in the Card from north and south are drawne every where at an equall distance each from other, from the Equinoctiall to the Pole; but on a globe which is made round like the earth, they are not of an equall distance, but the more northerly they come, so much the nearer they come each to other. So that two strokes from north to south at the latitude of 60 degrees, are but halfe so wide from one another, as they are at the Equinoctiall, and at the Pole they touch each other. Therefore two shipps being under the Equinoctiall distant from one another two hundred leagues, they may both sayle directly north without hinderance, comming to the height of 60 gr. but being 100 leagues from each other, and that following the same course, they would in the end meet each other under the pole, but if you direct such two ships by a plaine Carde, they will bee alway at equall distance, by which it sufficiently appeares, that all places lying far north, are much too wide, unlesse they bee drawne in, which cannot bee done, but you must make other places more faulty.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 35. <HI>Point.</HI> Of variation of the Compasse, and how you shal find the turning aside of the needle or variation.</HEAD>
<P>THe needle or the stile under the Compasse, touched with the Load-stone, draweth to divers places di∣versely, in some places directly to the north, in other places it wendeth to the east, and in other towards the west; As for Example, at the Ilands of Corvo and Flores) the most westerne of the Flemish Ilands. At Helmshuy a little on the west side of the north Cape. About 30 leagues west∣wards from the south corner of Spitsburg, on the east side of the Cape of good Hope, at Cabo das Aguilhas, and at other places, as well in the East as in the West-Indies, the needle directeth you just north. Westwards from the Flemmish Ilands on the east side of the Cape, at Nova Zembla, on the coast of Spitsburgh, and on the east side of Cape das Aguilhas on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Indian Sea, it standeth from the north Westwards, and in the east side of the Flemmish Ilands, on the west side of the Cabo de Bona Esperance and other places more, it standeth from the north eastwards. The variation of the needle is two-fold, to wit, from the north to the west, and from the north to the east, and the south are againe of two sorts, the increa∣sing and decreasing westward, in like sort the increasing and decreasing eastwards: The increasing eastward and westward, is, as you sayle from east to the west, increa∣sing &amp; diminishing, that which decreaseth, may he plaine∣ly understood by this Example.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>1 <HI>Example.</HI></HEAD>
<P>If you sayle from the Ilands Corvo and Flores, where the needle standeth right eastward on the coast of Spaine, the needle beginneth by litle and little so much the more) to wind toward the east, until you have sayled the Strait of Gibraltar, where it is at the highest (as they hold) 13 gr. that is increasing northeastering.</P>
<P>From thence sayling alongst the Middle-lands Sea, it beginneth to decrease, untill you come at the place, cal∣led the Mouth of the Venetian Gulfe, where it vanisheth, and the needle againe draweth directly north, this they call decreasing north eastering.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>2 <HI>Example.</HI></HEAD>
<P>If you sayle from the Cabo das Aguilhas (where the
<PB REF="25"/> needle standeth directly north) eastwards to the Indies the needle beginneth to decline from the north towards the west, untill you come a little on the east side of the Iland S. Brandaon, where it is at the height of 22 gr. or two whole strokes that is increasing northwestering.</P>
<P>Sayling from thence, you begin to decrease, till you are at the south point of Celebes, where againe the needle draweth right, this is called decreasing northwestering.</P>
<P>For the common navigation from this Countrey to the east, north, England, France, or Spaine the stiles (to di∣rect the Lilly right north) set fast under the rose, about two third parts from the stroke, from the north to the east. The stretching and course of the one Country towards the other in the common Cards, are drawne by such a Compasse, so that you may sayle it without altering of the Compasse or shaking any other reckoning or account.</P>
<P>In great journies, when the needle declineth sometime to the west, and sometime to the east, a stroke or two, or more, it is necessary to observe it sharply, over what side, and how much it standeth from the north, that you may be certaine, what course you shall hold in sailing.</P>
<P>To find the declining of the Compasse, that is, how much the lilly standeth to the east or to the west, seek first the just north (that by it you may know the declining) thus make a box quadrangle, or foure cornered, and reasonable deep, as it followes A B C D E F G, in the midst of it under in a glasse let the Compasse swimme on a pinne, so that it bee round about at an equall distance from the box, as S T, divide that on the outermost corner of the Rose into foure times ninety degrees, and lay the needle just under it, even as in the Compasse that you follow in sayling. Within on the one side of the box, which wee call the north side, make a sharp coper or brasen corner or edge, just in the midst between A and D, lifted upon the side A D, so that the compasse may passe close by it without let, as H, without on the south side B C F G, at the under corner make a little beame, as F G, about halfe an inch broad at the upper-edge, in each side make a hole at I and K, both equally distant from the flat B C F G, at the under corner make a little beame, as F G, from the one to the other a right line which may bee plainly seene, as I K; at the upper-edge in the middest betweene B C, make a pinne as long as the underbeame, like L, and just so farre as the line I K on the beame standeth from the flat, just so far make from the flat a scoach in the foresaid pinne L, after that make a string or a smooth cord fast to each end in the foresaid holes of the little beame as at I K, and with the midst of the foresaid pinne at V, so that the string being stretched hard, may stand at an equall distance from the flat in all places B C F G, from the point L make a halfe circle, a little lifted out of the flat, as M D N, so that the line M N be equally distant at all points with the upper-edge of the box, or the beame and the line L O (deviding the halfe circle into two quadrants) square right
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> on I K, divide the halfe circle at the inner corner in twice ninety degrees.</P>
<P>Lastly, make a ring of brasse or wood as P Q R, that you may hang the box on it, that the uppermost flat A B C D may hang Water-compasse, the south side B C F G, and the edges B F C G, and the Line L O just in the lead, this being thus prepared, the use followeth.</P>
<P>Three or foure houres before noone, more or lesse you
<PB REF="26"/> shall turne the corner C G, towards the Sunne, so that the shaddow of the one side of the string L K may fall right along the lide, K I, and then looke the de∣gree of the Compasse which commeth to stand by the brasen edge H, which I suppose to bee the 30 degrees of north and by West, as in the second Figure following at A. At the same instant, you shall observe the height of the Sunne at the shadow of the pinne L, in halfe circle M O N, or you shall take it more truely and certainly with the crosse staffe or Astrolabe, that which wee take here to be 25 gr. we set it down for memories sake. Fur∣ther you shall stay soo long in the afternoone, untill the Sunne bee come to the same height of 25 gr. then turne the edge B F, just against the Sunne, so that the shaddow of the side of the string L I may fall right along the line I K, and look what degree of the compasse commeth to stand by the coper or brasen edge H, which I suppose to bee the 30 gr. for the north, toward the east, as on B, this being so in the middest of the circle A B, as at C, is the north point which you desire, and if the Lilly bee directed right to it, then hath that compasse no variation, but di∣recteth right north. But if your taking aforesaid in the af∣ternoone bee not fouud the thirtieth, but the fiftieth de∣gree from the north towards the east, as at D, in such a cause you shall devide the circle A D, being 80 gr. at E, into two parts, so that A E and E D may each of them contayne 40 gr. which being so, E will bee the north point, and such a compasse turneth from the north to the west from E to C 10 gr. which is very neare a whole stroke. But if in the foresaid taking in the afternoon the coper or brasen edge hath stood 10 gr. on the West side of the Lilly or flour deluce, as at F, then you must devide the circle A F, containing 20 into two parts at G; so that A G and G F might each of them containe tenne degrees, which being so, G will be the north point, and the Lilly of such a compasse windeth toward the east from the north 20 gr, namely from C to G, and thus it will bee in all other fi∣gures. This is to bee observed: that you may take the height before the noon twice, thrice, foure times or more, at divers heights of the Sunne; As for Example: The first time when the Sunne is at the height of 10 gr. the second time at the height 15 gr. the third at 20 gr. and in the af∣ternoone at the same height and by comparing the one ta∣king with the other, you shall finde how they agree each
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> with other, thus finding alwayes the same north point, you shall be certaine that you have taken it truly &amp; right.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Tides.</HEAD>
<P>IT is knowne to all experienced Mariners that the eb∣bing and flowing of the sea is governed by the Moone, soo that every new and full Moone the waters are higher which they call spring-tydes, and at the quarter of the Moon the waters are lowest: so that you may know and that certainly by former observation, (although the true and reall cause thereof is yet hidden from us) the houre of the tyde, and on what point or stroke the Moone ma∣keth high water in any particular place, to the great pro∣fit and furtherance of navigation.</P>
<P>To know on what stroke the Moone is, it may be done in a two-fold manner, by the sight, or by marking how old the Moone is; to looke at some stroke of the Compasse, it may not be done according to the common Compasse lying flatte or driving water Compasse, because the Ho∣rizon divideth only into equall strokes, and sheweth in what virticall Circle or Azimuth the Sunne or Moone standeth, but by a compasse that (being lifted up) accord∣ing to the Superficiall part of the Equinoctiall, devideth the Equinoctiall in equall parts, as the common flatt two driving doth the Horizon; such an Equinoctiall compasse is made in this manner as you see in this figure: where the roundell A B C sheweth the flatt of the Equinoctiall, the gnomen E D the axeltree of the world. The fore∣said rondel in B marked on both sides, in the inside with the Compasse, and on the edge of the outside with twice
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> 24 houres and in the east and west at L and M hanging on two pinnes as it were on an axeltree, so that these being turned up and downe, and the gnomen set and the nether end by D and by the Quadrant F D G, that you may place him at the height of any pole.</P>
<P>If you set such a compasse with the bottom water compasse, the line H K just north and south, to wit, H to the north and K to the south, and the lower end of the gnomen by such a degree of the Quadrant F C, accord∣ing to the height of the Pole where you are: there will the roundell A B C, stand even with the surface of the true Equinoctiall, and the gnomen E D with the axeltree of the world.</P>
<P>The sight on such a Compasse, and a common one, differeth very much, and by how much nearer the Equi∣noctiall soo much more will the difference bee, as will ap∣peare by this example following.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first Example.</HEAD>
<P>On the height of 50 gr. or thereabout, the Sunne being in the beginning of Cancer in the greatest norther∣ly declination, it is on a common Compasse east at halfe an houre past seven, and west at halfe an houre past foure, that is: he goeth from the east to the west through the south in nine houres, but from the west through the north to the east in 15 houres.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Second Example.</HEAD>
<P>At the height of 30 degrees, hee comes little before halfe an houre past nine at the east, and a little after halfe an houre past two to the west, and so it goeth in lesse then five houres and a halfe from the east through the south in∣to the west, but from the west through the north to the east he goeth more then 18 houres.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The third Example.</HEAD>
<P>The Dragonshead being in the beginning of Aries, and the Moone in the beginning of Cancer, they make 5 gr. more declination than the Sunne, and go to the foresaid height of 30 gr, more then an houre sooner from the east to the west, then the Sunne, to wit, about the space of 4 houres, and againe from the west to the east about the space of 2 houres.</P>
<P>Under the line, the Sunne having noo declination, riseth in the morning in the east, and rising remaineth east un∣till he commeth to the Zenith and passeth that to the
<PB REF="26"/> west, and abideth so descending west, till he approacheth the Horizon and is according to a flatt driving com∣passe, the one halfe of the day east, and the other west, without comming on any other stroke; but it is not so on such an Equinoctiall compasse. The Sunne and Moone both going alwayes in the same distance of time over eve∣ry stroke, to wit, from the east to the south in six houres, and from the south to the west in six houres, and againe from the west through the north in twice six houres.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">

<P>Eight dayes after the moon hath beene new or at the full, I desire to know when the moone commeth to the south, at Embden, or Enckhuysen, and such like places, makes high water (for there a north and a south moone makes full sea) I seek under the north and south stroke the 8 day in the 1 columne, and by that in the second 6 houres, 24 minut. on that then shall the moone come to the north and south at 6 hour. 24 min. and make high water in that place.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 37. <HI>Point.</HI> How to finde the age of the Moone.</HEAD>
<P>TO doe this without an Almanack, you must know the Epact or Key of the yeare, and that you shall finde by the Golden number, and the Golden number thus: looke how many years there are past from the yeare of our Lord, 1500, and these divide by 19 and what re∣mains is the Golden number of that yeare, if there re∣maine nothing, the golden number is 19.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>I desire to know the Golden number of the yeare 1645, setting the 1500 a side, I devide the 145 yeares by 19, I find seven times, and the remainder is 12. Then the Gol∣den number of the yeare 1645. is 12.</P>
<P>The Golden number increaseth every yeare with the beginning of the yeare with one, as in the yeare 1640, it is 7, 1641 it is 8. and so forth to 19, after that againe 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. The Epact changeth every yeare on the first of March increasing with 11 to 30, but being more then 30, you must leave that 30 and the remainder is the Epact. You shall finde it by the golden number thus: tell the golden number on the 3 joynts of your thumme, beginning with one at the lower joynts, unto the golden number of your yeare proposed, if it doth end this kind of telling at the lower joynt, then the Epact and the golden number are all one: but if it end on the second joynt, adde 10, if on the third joynt, adde 20 by the same golden number, that number is the Epact of that yeare.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>I desire to know the Epact of the yeare 1645, the Gol∣den number is 12, telling on the joynts of the thumme be∣ginning with one at the lower joynt, the telling endeth with 12 on the highest joynt, adding 20 to 12, you shall have 32 substract 30 there remaines 2 for the Epact of that yeare.</P>
<P>After the old stile, the Golden number is the selfe same with the new stile, but the Epact is 10 more, there∣fore if you adde 10 to the Epact of the new stile, you shall have the Epact of the old stile, as for the yeare 1645, 10, to 12, (the Epact of the new stile) comes 22, this is the Epact of that yeare according to the old stile.</P>
<P>But to find the Epact without telling, is the golden num∣ber to know both according to the old and new stile, look on this table following, where they are set the one by the other.</P>

<P>The Epact being known, you shall adde it to the num∣ber of the moneths that are past from March to the moneth you are in, the same moneth being reckoned with it, if this brings forth 30, then is it new moon the first day of the same moneth, but as much as is lesse then 30. so many dayes you have to the new moon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1641. I desire to know when the Moon shall be new in the moneth of August, the Epact of that year is 18, adding to this 6. for the number of the moneths since March (the moneth of August being included) it makes 24, there want 6 to make it 30, therefore the Moon shall be new 6 dayes at this, that is the 6 of August.</P>
<P>The Epact, the number of the moneth past from March and the day of the moneth being added, such a number, (or whatsoever it brings forth, more then 30) it sheweth the age of the Moon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The first Example.</HEAD>
<P>To know the age of the Moon on the 12 of August 1645. I adde the Epact 2 to 6, the moneths past, and 12 for the 12 dayes, they make this 20, is the age of the Moon, but this is to be understood after the new stile.</P>
<P>To finde out easily without casting up the time of the new Moon, we have here adjoyned an Almanack for 8. years next ensuing, calculated by the meridian of Amster∣dam, shewing the day and houre of every new and full Moon, together with the quarters, the use of it is thus: by the Moon in every moneth there are two columnes of ci∣phers, the first sheweth the day of the moneth, the second the houres and minutes of the new and full Moon, to reckon from the noone of the same day, to the noone of the day following, according to the use and custome of Astronomers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Example.</HEAD>
<P>I would know in the year 1645, in the moneth of July, on what day and houre the moon will be new, and I finde the new Moon on the 22 day, 14 houres telling from noone tyde and this run to the next day in the morning at two of the clock.</P>
<P>To know what day of the week that will be, you must first know the Dominicall letter of that year, and with what letter each moneth beginneth, the Sundayes letter you shall finde under the Almanack of each year, the leap year hath two, the first you shall use to the 24 of Februarie, the other to the end of the year, every moneth beginneth with such a letter as this table following sheweth:

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The first Demonstration, <HI>Where in</HI> Are described the south Sea, the Vliestreame, the Vlie, and the channell of Ameland.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen you saile from Am∣sterdam to the Fall of Vrck, you must keep the middle of the channell, in sailing to Tyoort, and from thence over Pam∣pus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pampus.</NOTE> with a shipp of great draught, that draweth tenne foot or more; keepe Marcken church without to the land of Udam, called Schytel∣doecks-haven, so long untill that the steeple of Zuyder∣wouw come past Kinnigherbuert, which are the houses half way betwixt Schyteldoecks-haven &amp; Durgerdam, goe then towards the land e. untill that the New church of Amsterdam come about Durgerdam, keepe that so standing, untill that the church of Weesp be come past the House or Castle at Muyen, so that it do stand some∣what nearer to Muyen then to the House, keepe Weesp standing so, untill that Edam come without the east end of Marken. In this farewaye it is a foote deeper, then if you sailed right through.</P>
<P>For to avoyde Muyen sand: men were wont to bring the houses which were wont to stand upon Tyoort to the southwards of the Heyligher-stee at Amsterdam, thereby you may make some reckoning, they are good longst markes: when Monnickedam is about the west end of Schyteldoecks-haven, and the house at Muyen betwixt Weesp and the church at Muyen, then are you thwart of Muyen sand. For to saile right through over Pampus, then keepe the steeple of Diemen over or a∣bout the point of Tyoort, so long as you can see Tyoort, that is a right longst marke for to saile over Pampus.</P>
<P>When you are come thwart of the east end of Mar∣ken, goe then on northeast, or somewhat more east∣wardly towards the Fall of Urck, which is 7 leagues: when you are come with in a great league of Urck, you shall meete with a hard sand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hout¦ribbe.</NOTE> called the Houtribbe, lying southeast and northwest thwart over the Farewaye, there is no more water upon it, then upon the Flat of Wieringen, or of Freesland, you shall finde alsoo no deeper water there then eight through. When Enckhuy∣sen lyeth northwest &amp; northwest and by west from you, then you are upon the Houtribbe. Before that you come against the sand, you can by night see the fire upon Urck. When as Urck or the fire is more northerly then northeast from you, and that you get shoaling, then that is certainly of the Houtribbe: for so you can∣not come too neare the Enckhuysen sand. When you come from the southwards, you are not about the Enck∣huysen sand before that the church upon Urck come without the little village of houses, which is then east and by south, and east southeast from you: if that then you goe away northwest and by west or westnorthwest you shall runne close alongst by the side of the sand. With a ship of great draught, bring the church a good way through the houses, untill that it stand eastsouth∣east from you, then goe bouldly on northwest and by west or keepe Medenblick without the point of the Ven, and so you shal not come too near neither to sand nor shoale. Likewise if you come from the northwards, and bring Urck not more eastwardly then eastsoutheast from you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks of Enckhuy∣sen sand.</NOTE> then you cannot take hurt also of the Enck∣huysen sand. From Urck to the buyes upon the Cripple and Hof-stede, the course is northwest and by west with that course you may runne all alongst unto the souther buye upon Wieringhe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Flat: in turning to wind∣wards, you may well bring Medenblick a little within the point of the Ven, but when as Medenblick is without it, then you are in the right fareway.</P>
<P>Betwixt Urck and the buye upon the Hofstede north∣east somewhat eastwardly from the steeple of Enckhuy∣sen lyeth a little plate of hard sand, lying towards the end of Enckhuysen sand, which is not deeper then the Frees Flat, about to the eastwards of it, is the deepest water, but about to the westwards of it (by some called the Katte-gar) you shall be sooner about the High horne, or the Enckhuysen sand, &amp; it is good for ships that draw but little water.</P>
<P>The thwart markes of the buyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks of the buyes upon the Hof-stede &amp; Cripple</NOTE> both upon the Cripple and Hosstede; are Grootebroeck and Hem (two sharp steeples) right one in the other, and Warnis, a little sharp steeple in Freesland to the south side of the Cliffe of Staverne, then you have the length of these buyes, which lye each of them in three fathom, the one on the east shoare, and the other on
<PB N="2" REF="35"/> the west shoare upon the tayle of the Cripple. There is in the right fare waie, two foot lesse then five fathom, and soft ground. When the steeple of Medenblick com∣meth to the northwards of the house of Medenblick, so farr as the house is broade, then you are cleare of Cripple sand, and past it; goe then on northwest, and northwest and by north to the buye upon the Creyl, according as the winde and tyde shall be, the right farewaie there, is deepe 5 fathom scarce. Thwart of the Creyl, in sailing out or about the Cryel, in sailing in, that is a little within the Creyl<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yl.</NOTE> on the north shoar, lyeth alongst the reach (towards the buye upon the Hosstede, a hard sand or plate, called the south Creyl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">South Creyl.</NOTE> upon which there is no more then twelve foot water, at low water, betwixt that banck and the north shoare, it is three fathom deepe, and soft ground, and to the southwards, or the westwards of it, foure fathom and an halfe. When Mir∣nes, a little flat steeple in Freesland, commeth over a long countrie-house to the southwards of the cliffe of Staverne, then you come right thwart of that foresayd plate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark of the Creyl.</NOTE>The markes of the buye upon the Creyl, are the sharpe steeple of Twisck over the Cornemill to the west∣wards of Medenblick, and that little flat steeple of Mir∣nes to the south side or east side of the cliffe. The right fareway there is four fathom and an half, &amp; five fathom deep, soft ground, the buye lyeth in four fathom, if need require, men may runne wel a cables length about to the eastwardes of it.</P>
<P>From the buye upon the Creyl, to the buye upon the Freese plate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freese plate.</NOTE> the course is north and by east: When the steeple of Twisck commeth a little to the northwards of Medenblick, then keepe them soo standing, so long as you can see it; &amp; then you shal not saile within any shoales betwixt that plate and the Creyl.</P>
<P>Betwixt the buye upon the Creyl, and the Freese plate, on the west shoare, alongst the Reach, lyeth a hard sand, called Monick-sand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monick-sand.</NOTE> which men may be foul of, if they runne somewhat too farre over to the west∣wards.</P>
<P>When you are come about the Creyl, you may goe on north and by east (with a shippe that draweth but little water) over the tayle of Broad-sand, right to the buye upon the sand, called West-worckum, but with shippes of great draughts, you must keep the right farewaye. For to finde the deepest water upon the flat: bring Pendragen, a little flatte steeple (standing to the westwards of Worckum) to the westwards of a little village, which standeth alsoo to the westwards of Worc∣kum, and saile so right with it, that is a good longst marke of the buy upon the Freese plate, and soo you shall runne right with the buy, when as that Warnes and Mirnes come one in the other, to the north∣wards of Staveren, then you have the length of the buy, which lyeth on the west side of the Plate, you must runne alongst to the westwards of it, there is the deepest water: when you come from the northwards, you might sayle within the Freese-plate on the east shoare.</P>
<P>Being past the foresayd buye upon the plate, goe on northnortheast, untill that Pendragen come betwixt the little village and Voorwolde. If that you have then the cliffe through Staveren, then you have the deepest wa∣ter upon the shoalest of the slatt, then men runne com∣monly a little more norherly unto the buye in the Bight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buy in the Bight</NOTE> and alongst to the westwards of it, which lyeth right in the farewaye, in sixteen foot, but alongst to the east∣wards of the buye is the deepest water, the farther into the Bight towards Freesland the deeper. The marke of this buy, is the little flatt steeple of Mirnes on to the southwards of Molqueren. Bring that foresayd little slat steeple in Molqueren, &amp; keepe it so standing, &amp; then you come in the farewaye of the buy of West-worckum, that is a very good marke, when the buyes are taken away.</P>
<P>The old thwart markes of the buy in the Bight, are Mirnes▪ Molqueren, Hemelum, and a little long village, when they stand in four parts. Betwixt the buyes upon the Freese plate, and in the Bight, is the shoalest of the flatt. When the buy in the Bight is on your broad side, then go on north and by west, somewhat more westerly, unto the buy of West-worckum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buy of West-worckum</NOTE> which lyeth on the east shoare in 16 foot at low water, upon these marks: a little sharpe steeple, far within the land, called Harich, commeth over a little village, to the northwards of Hinlopen, called Dertwisch, the right deepe thwart of it is three fathom. The old markes are two villages next to Mackum, upon the water side, standing north∣east off from it, when these stand a little asunder, one from the other, you see yet two little steeples some∣what to the northwards of Bolswart, almost one to the other, neare about as the other upon the water side stand asunder, the one is called Idsegahuysen. The thwart markes are a high house on the east end of Coudom, that commeth within a capstane barres length to the south end of Hinlopen. From thence to the buy upon Yghel∣hoeck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yghel∣hoeck.</NOTE> the course is north, the markes there of are, a little sharpe steeple with the first long village to the northwards of Worckum, called Geest, when that little steeple commeth in the innermost swampe of that long village, then you have the buye, that is a good thwart marck: the longst marks are, the sharpe steeple of Pin∣gom over the flat steeple of Coorenwaert upon the waterside, and Pendragen to a little house to the north∣wardes of the village with the swamp, or when the mil of Staveren standeth betwixt the towne and the Block-house of Stavern, these are all good longst markes of the buy upon Yghelhoeck.</P>
<P>From Yghelhoeck to the middle ground the course is north, the right deepe in the Middle ground<NOTE PLACE="marg">Middle-ground.</NOTE> is seven fathom in the farewaye betwixt Westworckum and Yghelhoeck the right deep in four fathom, soft ground, the east shoare is flat and the west shoare steep. The buy of the Middle ground lieth upon these marks: the two sharpe steeples Arun and Pingom one in the other about northeast from you: or Bolswaert right to the northwards of a Countrie house, to the northwardes of Mackum, these are good thwart marks of the Middle-ground. The longst markes are: kinswaert (that is the runner) commeth behind the church of Surich, then you are right in the farewaie. The Church of Surigh standeth upon the water side, upon a point that lyeth out about northeast and by north from the buy, or when the flat steeple of Wynaem (to the northwards of Harlingen) commeth betwixt Midlum and the east end of Harlingen, then you are right in the Middleground, on which side that Wynaem standeth nearest, that shoare you are also nearest unto, the west shoare is steep; the east shoare indifferent flat, you may runne over it in three fathom, and come againe in five fathom towards Friesland. From the Middle-ground outwards to the Flye, you can sail within no tayles of sand on the west shoare.</P>
<P>Being past the buy in the Middle-ground, then goe on northnorthwest unto the buy upon Swanebalgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swane∣balgh</NOTE> which lyeth in 3 fathom on the east shoare, the thwart marks there of are Bolswaert over a little short house to the southwards of Cornwaert. When you runne over betwixt the buyes of the Middle-ground and Swane∣balgh on the east shoare more easterly then in three fathome, that you come againe in four or five fathom, you might (in sayling out) sail behind the shoals of Swanebalgh, or when you are bound in behinde the shoals of the Middleground, the west shoare thwart of this, you may sound in four fathom, or three fathom and a half, over against the buye upon Swane∣balgh, on the west shoare is good ground for to anchor in.</P>

In sailing up, you might sail within the w. shoare over against Schuytesand, or a little to the southwards of it in 3 fathom, or 3 fathom &amp; a half into a Deadbalg, behind a taile of sand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Point of Waert.</NOTE> called the point of the Waert, but keeping in 4 fathom from that shoare, you cannot take hurt of it. In sailing up with a forfloud, keep the east shoare, or els you should be lightly carried therwith into the foresaid balgh, behind that Waert, before you should be aware of it. Upon the point of that waert standeth a drift beacon, &amp; 2 to the northwards or the westwards of it, which men do call the beacons of Claesoomen, and to the southwards of it standeth a beacon upon Domini∣cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plate, or (as the Pilots do name it) Meynsen plate.

<HEAD>The Eyder.</HEAD>
<P>Six leagues to the northwards of the Elve lyeth the Eyder, with many shoals lying farre out without the land chiefely and most on the south side, on the north side of the deepe alongst by the land of Eyderstee lieth a long sand called the Broad-back, or New-grounds, on the south side lye Blavoort, the Iron Hendrick, the Hound and Hecksand. To the southwards of Blavoort, &amp; the Iron Hendrick, about a league to the southwards of the mouth of the Eyder, goeth yet a Deep in called the North pipe, where men may saile in, and come out againe by the Hound upon the Eyder. In this Eyder lye on the south side of the Deepe seven black buyes, which you must leave all (in sayling in) on the star∣board side, and on the north shoare, which you must leave on the larboard side. The outermost buye lyeth from the steepe buye right north, and from Holy-land east or a little mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e northerly seven or eight leagues. When you fall with the land with that course you shall espye to the northwards of the Eyder, upon the land of Eyderstee, a sharpe steeple indifferent high, called Gardingen, bring that over or to the south side of the little sand-hils lying on the north side of the Eyder, called the Souther-Heads, they shall then stand from you northeast and by north, or a little more easterly, sayle right in with them so, &amp; you shall fall with outer∣most buy, when that then the sharpe steeple of Weslin∣buren, standing to the southwards of the Eyder in the land of Ditmarsen commeth to be east or a little more southerly from you, then you have the length of the fore∣sayd buye, &amp; then S. Peters Church upon the Eyderstee to the westwards of Gardingen, not farre from the sea side, shall stand from the northn. east. Thus, or comming out of the southwest upon the foresayd markes of Gar∣dingen, and the Souther-heads, you shall run over the shoale of Blavoort, which men do call alsoo the taile of the Hound, lying off from Blavoort almost halfe waies to Holy-land. It is also by some called Blavoort, or com∣ming from the northwards, bring the foresayd steeple of Weslinburen east or a little more southerly from you, &amp; saile so right in untill that Gardingen commeth to the foresaid southerheads, or that S. Peters church bee north∣northeast from you, in doing so you shall not misse also the outermost buy. From the outermost buy to the se∣cond, third &amp; fourth, it is al one course eastsoutheast the second lieth upon the shoalest of the channell at low water in 16 foot, the the third in 4 fathom, and the fourth in 5 fathom.</P>
<P>These three last lye alongst the north side of Blavoort, on the south side of the deepe. In sayling in. You must leave them all on the starboard side, &amp; runne
<PB N="12" REF="43"/> alongst to the northwards of them. From the fourth to the fifth, that is, the buye upon the Hound, the course is east, which lyeth thwart of the Hound, on a point which lieth off from Heckesand, which in comming in, men might at unawares sayle within alongst to the south∣wards of the buye, therefore you must leave that also (as well as the former) on the starboard side, and sayle alongst to the northwards of it. Betwixt this fore∣sayd buye upon the Hound and the fourth, lyeth another buye upon the north side of the deep, upon the souther∣most poynt of the New-grounds, which you must leave on the larboard side, &amp; runne about to the southwards of it. From the buye upon the Hound to the sixth, the course is northnortheast, and two fathom deep. From the sixth to the seventh and last buye northeast and by north, and the deepe alongst to the northwards of it three fathom. Being past the last buye, follow the beakons, which stand alongst on the north shoare, untill you come to Hulck, runne close alongst to the south∣wards or to the eastwards of them, for to avoyd a tayle of sand, which commeth off from the east shoare, which men might unawares sayle within into a Dead-creeke. From the Hulck to Schulperzile, the course is east southeast. In that reach, the beakons stand on the south side upon the Ballast-plate, and you must run alongst to the northwards by them, leaving them on the larboard side. From Schulperzile to Tonningen the course is northnortheast. Before Tonningen the Eyder is at the shoalest, and at low water no deeper then one fathom and a halfe. From thence further in towards the New∣town called Frederick stadt, there is depth enough.</P>
<P>The depths here before mentioned are all to bee un∣derstood at low water. From Tonningen towards Wollersum, the Eyder lyeth alongst northeast and by east. From Wollersum towards Harebleck north∣northwest. From Harebleck towards Reymers-bode northeast. From Reymers-bode towards Nyenzyle eastsoutheast. From Nyenzyle to the Nyen-veere south.</P>
<P>Betwixt the fourth buye upon the Eyder and the fifth, that is, the buye upon the Hound, over against the buye upon the southermost poynt of the New-grounds, stand two beakons a little to the southwards of the fore∣sayd two buyes, the westermost upon the east poynt of the Blavoort, or the Iron Hendrick, and the easter∣most upon the taile of the Hound. Betwixt these two beakons goeth in through a deepe southeast or south∣east and by east, where you may sayle through alongst by the beakons upon the Iron Hendrick (which you must leave then on the starboard side) untill you come into the end of the North-pipe, which lyeth from thence about west into sea. You may sound in at the North-pipe, comming in out of the sea by the south shoare in 3 &amp; 4 fathom, untill you come to the foresayd beakons, &amp; then about by them northwest, or somewhat more westerly up unto the Eyder, or else you may runne further alongst by the foresayd south shoare, untill you come about the beakon upon Hoedmeersand, and then forth betwixt the Island Bulheads and Buysen alongst by the Beakons upon Hoedmeersand, with many poynts and bights on to the southwards, and come out at last upon the Old Elve, about northeast from the New-work against the New-grounds, which is not well to bee sayled, but of those that are there very well acquainted.</P>
<P>Alongst by the North shoare of the Eyder, close to the southwards of the little sand-hills, the southerheads, runneth in yet a Land-deepe, east and east and by north in, &amp; commeth out againe upon the Eyder by the Hulck, that serveth but onely for small ships, there remaineth at low water but five foot.</P>

<P>For to sayle from Holyland to the Hever, goe on northeast somewhat easterly, or according as the winde and tyde shall be, and runne towards the grounds, untill you come in six or seven fathom, and then you shall espye a steeple which is sharpe, and indifferent high, called Piel-worme, bring that northeast &amp; by north from you, a masts length to the southwards of the souther∣most Cow-house, upon the little Island Nuball, keepe that so standing, and sayle towards it, and you shall so finde the outermost buy, from that to the second buy, goe on northeast and northeast and by east; being come to it, Piel-worme steeple shall stand northnortheast from you. From the second buy alongst inwards, the course is northeast and by east. Being come in so a good wayes, you shall finde two beakons on the starboard side, upon a dry sand, called the Quade, there over against commeth the north balgh in the right Hever. From the first beakon to the second &amp; third, the course is east and by north, sayle all alongst by the beakons, leaving them on the starboard side.

For to avoyd that when you come from the northwards, edge off so far from the shoare, that the red Cliffe come without the sand-hills, or that you may see it plainely: Then you may goe well over Haef-sand, with a ship that is not of a very great draught. Likewise when you come out at the channell of List, and are bound to the northwards, sayle so farre out that you may see the Cliffe, and then you may goe over the foresayd sand, which lyeth from the south end of Rem a good wayes into sea.</P>

Being past the Capes, then luffe up to the northwards, about the sand where the Capes stand upon, and anchor there where you please, there it is wide and broad, and also deep and steepe, so that there you can take no hurt. The Ryper ships that are bound out, doe lye there for to stay for a winde. Behinde the Island Manu it is 6 and 7 fathom deepe, there also men may ride, from thence you may go up the deep to Rypen, but not up alongst to Rype with great ships, close to Rypen the deep endeth, so that there is a shoaleneck betwixt both, where there is no more then 6 foot depth.

<P>About northeast, or northeast and by north from the north end of Phanu lyeth a little Hill, called Luysbergh: a little to the northwards of it lyeth a long plaine sand∣hill, called Langeleg: from thence lyeth the land to∣wards Zuyder-zyt westnorthwest and eastsoutheast.</P>
<P>Betwixt the north poynt of Phanu &amp; Langeleg<NOTE PLACE="marg">Langeleg</NOTE> goeth in that Growe-deep. For to sayl in there when you come from the southwards, run alongst the Island Phanu, and about by the north end of it (which is farre flat.) When as that you get deeper water, you shall see three or four hommocks about northeast from you, upon the high land with a little flat steeple, called Holm, or Bruynum. Bring that little Church a cables length to the northwards of the Hommocks, goe in then northeast, and keep the south shoare, untill you come within that dry sand, which shooteth off from Phanu, called Smeursand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smeur∣sand.</NOTE> you may run to that upon your sight without doing amisse, but leave that on the star∣board side when you come in. The shoares are there abouts both of them very steepe, as well Wisdike, (that is the Plate which lyeth in the channell) as also Smeursand, but without the shoares are flat. When you are past the poynt of Smeursand, edge then over to Wisdike, and anchor there untill that you have the lowest water, and then you may sayle to Hartingen, and go on forth to Wardt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wardt.</NOTE> or Woerdt, which lyeth eight or nine lea∣gues within the land, the river is very crooked; upon the which here and there lyeth a Gentlemans house.</P>

<P>From Phanu to Schellingkroegh<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schelling∣kroegh.</NOTE> it is four leagues, betwixt them lyeth Zuyder-zyt a little river of eight or nine foot water. The land betwixt Langeleg and Zuy∣der-zyt is ragged land with sand-hilles, and rough, being grown with spirie grasse, or heath. If you should fall with the land at Zuyder-zyt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zuyder-zijt.</NOTE> and that you could not lead it into the channell, then choose the land of Lange∣leg, you may run to it without danger, keepe in two fathom and a halfe, and you cannot sayle amisse of this Kroegh: sor you may sound this land all alongst in two fathom and an halfe off from Langeleg untill you come within Schellingh-kroegh, but if you run in three fathom or three fathom and a halfe, you shall sayle without the driesand, and run about a seaboard of the forenamed Kroegh. Schellingh-kroegh lyeth in most northwest men lye there within, sheltred for all winds, like as men doe lye at Coningsborough in the Kettell. If so bee that you come from the northwards, and are bound into this Haven or Kroegh, you may run about by that drie sand in three fathom, when you come by the innermost point of that drie sand, there shooteth off a little tayle of sand, but you may see it well, and keepe your selfe from it: when you come to the east end of that sand, luffe up about it, untill you come into that Kroegh, and anchor there in two fathom and a foot, it is there very wide, you may make there a good board, and turne it in to windwards. A southsouthwest and northnortheast moone maketh there the highest water, the farther you come to the northwards to Iutland, the lesse tyde goeth, and the lesse it floweth up and downe.</P>
<P>At the north end of the foresayd drie sand lyeth the
<PB N="16" REF="48"/> Doodenbergh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dooden∣bergh.</NOTE> that is a short hommock of a Sand-hill, which lyeth alone. When you are somewhat off from it, then it lyeth under the other land, that you cannot see it, when you come from the southwards or the north∣wards you may see it. From the Doodenberg unto that south end of the drie sand, it is all alongst a faire strand, and flat ground. For to ride under the drie sand, you may sound about it comming from the northwards, and get smooth water for a northwest wind, and also for westerly windes.</P>
<P>A little to the northwards of the Doodenbergh lyeth the poynt called the Horne betwixt Zuyder-zyt and Wester-zyt making there a Horn of the land: to the southwards of it the Coast lyeth eastsoutheast and west∣northwest towardes the Growe-deepe: to the north∣wards of it north, and south towardes Wester-zyt. Wester-zyt is a village lying betwixt the Blawenbergh and the Horne.</P>
<P>About this poynt or Horne runneth off a long banck about twelve leagues westsouthwest into sea: called Reefshorne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reefshor∣ne.</NOTE> or as some do name it Devillhorne, which lyeth at some places altogether drye, specially seven or eight leagues from the shoare, where it is not deeper then two fathom and a halfe, or three fathom a foote lesse. A shippe that sayleth upon it, men can but even see it from the land it is at the deepest by the land, to witt four fathom lacking a foot. He that commeth there from the northwards with a ship of a great draught must take verie good heed, for it is upon the northwest side off steepe, that men shall have one caste two and twenty, the next cast fifteene, and the third cast no more then three fathom.</P>
<P>When you fall with the land with Wester-zyt or to the northwards of Reefshorne, you may sound alongst by the shoare in six or seven fathom, untill you come neare the foresayd Horne: you shall then also finde ano∣ther shoale Riffe, that runneth off from the land, called the Owle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Owl.</NOTE> which is also very steepe on the north side: from the northwards you may not come nearer it, then in seven fathom. A little to the southwardes of it be∣ginneth Reefshorne to runne off from the shoare, it is there a narrowe banck, you shall not finde there lesse then three fathom, or three fathom lacking a foot wa∣ter, at two or three cast, according as it shall blowe hard or soft, and that you shall make your waye, and then you shall get presently againe five fathom, and sound it about by that shoale sand, whether you desire to bee.</P>
<P>According to the opinion of some, Doggers-sand be∣ginneth from this banck. When men sette sayle early in the morning out of Rinkopper deepe, with a southwest waye, and a good northeast winde then they are about four of the clock in the afternoone yet in nine fathom, whereby it should appeare, that Doggers Sand should have his beginning at this banck.</P>
<P>For to know the land hereabouts: About four leagues to the northwardes of the foresayd Horne lyeth a high hill a little from the strand, called the Blawen∣bergh, going playn downe on both sides, which is some∣what blacker then the other land, being grown with spy∣rie grasse, to the southwards of this Blawenbergh lyeth that fishers village Wester-zyt, betwixt that village and the Horne lyeth one Black hommock, and also a Gentle∣mans house, otherwise the land is altogether full of hom∣mocks.</P>

From thence you may sayle over the Wadt to Rinkoppen.</P>
<P>This little haven is not to be reckoned for a Haven because sometimes it is cast too, and sometimes there may goe in and out againe Boates or Crayers and small shippes.</P>

<P>When you sayle alongst by it, you may see the blew double land of Rinkoppen, (called the Holmes) alongst over this land.</P>
<P>Betwixt Boevenberghen and the Reefhorne lye some banckes of seven, eight and nine fathom, and also some that are deeper.</P>
<P>Boevenberg<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boeven∣bergh.</NOTE> is a long smooth hill, having in the mid∣dest a high round hommock or hill, and upon that hill standeth a church with a steeple: when you come thwart to land with Boevenbergen, it sheweth it selfe in three hilles, the middlemost is the highest, upon which stan∣deth the foresayd church, with a flat steeple: upon both sides of that hill stand also other churches, but they are not so high: you may see the land in thirteene and four∣teene fathom, the ground is grosse red sand with some little stones there in.</P>
<P>When Boevenbergen is east northeast from you, it sheweth it self in a long hill, with some dale in the mid∣dest on the northside, with a church, and also a church on the south side, &amp; also another hill to the northwards of it.</P>

When that highest of of the land is southsoutheast from you, and that you can but even see the north end of it, then it is fifteen fathom deep, grosse rough sand, with some little stones amongst it.</P>
<P>Two leagues northeast, or as some say, somewhat more easterly, off from the north pointe of the Holmes: to wit, betwixt the north poynte and the Holmes, and the easter pointe, lyeth a stone banck (in manner as the Trindell of Lesolde) upon which there is no more then twelve foot water, so that there remaineth about two third parts of the water betwixt that Stonebanck and the north poynt, and the other third parte betwixt the Easter poynte &amp; the aforesaid Stonebanck: there have divers shippes beene lost upon it. The foresaid Easter poynt lyeth about four leagues to the eastwards of the Holmes, &amp; is also a high steep poynt, as if it where the Holmes. Right thwart of this caster point shooteth off a riffe almost a league off into sea, which you may sound about in seven fathom. Some say, that men may sayl through betwixt that riffe and the land.</P>
<P>From the Holmes to Robsnot or Robbeknuyt, the course is northeast nine or ten leagues.</P>
<P>A little to the westwards of Robsnot in the bight to∣wards the eastern poynte, nearest to Robsnot stand five churches with flat steeples.

<P>Somewhat within the poynt of the Scawe standeth a flat Church with a slat steeple, called Old Schagen, when that is southsoutheast from you, then there runneth off from the shoare, a little spitt or shoale, there you must edge somewhat off from the shoare, otherwise it is all alongst a steep strand betwixt Hartshals and the Scawe, but you may sounde about this little sand in four and five fathom, so neare as you will.</P>
<P>Upon the east end or outermost poynt of the Scawe, standeth a fire beakon, like a Cape to see too: when the Church is southwest and by west from you, then are the fire beakon and the steeple one in the other and then you are right thwart of the riffe of the Scawe, which lyeth off from the poynt eastnortheast, and by north almost a league into sea.</P>
<P>He that commeth from the westward, and will sayle alongst by the land, about the Riffe, must especially bee verie carefull in using the lead, he may take the soun∣ding of the shoare, so neare as he will, according as the winde shall be, in eight, seven, sixe, five, four, and also well in three fathom, without doing amisse, he neede not to feare: If he be but carefull in using his lead, with a southwest winde, he may sayl about it in three or four fathom.</P>
<P>When the fire beakon commeth to the east side of the houses of the Scawe, then you come against the west side of the riffe, when the fire beakon and the Church are one in the other, then you are on the east side of the Riffe.</P>
<P>When the fire beakon commeth about halfe wayes the houses, nearest the west side, then you are right upon the poynt of the Riffe, what depth that you have then you shall keep it still, without finding it shoaler, whether you saile alongst southeast or northwest.</P>
<P>He that commeth from the southwards, and is bound about the Scaw to the westwards may not sound the Riffe because the south side of it is steepe &amp; needle too, it is not good to come nearer to it then in twelve, thir∣teen, or fourteen fathom, especially by night or darke weather.</P>

It is a narrow channell betwixt Endelau, and the main land, lying from the Wedersound through the Swan-grounds<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swanne-grounds.</NOTE> south, it is on both sides shoale, and but a creek for to sayle through.</P>
<P>When you come off from the Melversound and will sayle through the Wedersound, it is best to runne alongst by the Juttish side untill thwart of the river of Horsens, then you must edge somewhat off there from the land, and sayle right with the Island Tons, and so you runne through betwixt the Norther and Souther grounds, leaving the Island Tons on the starboard side. When you are then past Tons, you shall runne out close by the north poynt of Sampso, towards the land of Ebeltud, it is altogether one course from Horsens to Tons, and forth to Sampso, and the poynt of Ebeltud, to wit, northeast and southeast eight or nine leagues.</P>
<P>From Horsens, or that Island Endelaw unto the Mel∣versound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melver∣sound.</NOTE> the course is south and south and by west, 7 or 8 leagues. The Melversound is a deep sound of 20 and 25 fathom, very crooked to come into, it goeth in betwixt Fuynen &amp; Jutland, which are both high lands. From the Island Ebelo unto Melversound the course is southwest and southwest &amp; by south five great leagues.</P>
<P>From the road of Sampso to Ebelo the course is south &amp; by west 5 leagues. From the south end of Sampso to Ebelo<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ebelo.</NOTE> the course is southwest and by south 4 leagues.</P>
<P>From Sampso to Roems<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roems.</NOTE> the course is southeast and by south six leagues. The northwest coast of Fuynen lyeth southwest and by west eight leagues. The little Island Ebelo lyeth off a league from the same, right before Bowens, but you cannot sayle through betwixt the Island and Fuynen. To the southwards of the Island lyeth a great rocke under water, betwixt this rock and the Island is the road before Bouwens<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road be∣fore Bou∣nes.</NOTE> in eight and nine fathom.</P>
<P>Betwixt Syro and Wero lyeth a dangerous riffe, long and broad, lying further then halfe way to Syro. When you will runne through betwixt the two foresaid Islands a weather of Russenesse, you must leave at least the two third parts of the water on the side of Wero, and goe in southsouthwest towards Roems, which is nine leagues distant.</P>
<P>The foresaid riffe is called Haters riffe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haters riffe.</NOTE> is on the east side very hard and stony, hee that commeth from Balt-sack, he shall run close to the Island Wero, for to avoyd that riffe, the channell betwixt the riffe and Wero is not very broad, &amp; 3 fathom, or 3 fathom &amp; a halfe deep. He that commeth from Roems or Rusnes, &amp; wil saile through Wero sound, let him bring the great Helm to the east side of Wero, and keep them so standing sailing on so right with them, he shall (so doing) take no hurt of Haters riffe. Betwixt Syro and Haters riffe and some∣what more southwardly, the ground is very uneven of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 fathom. On the south side of Haters riffe it is good anchoring for northerly winds, in six &amp; seven fathom.</P>
<P>Rusnes and Syro lye northnortheast and southsouth∣west about five leagues a sunder.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Rusnes runneth off a little riffe to seawards, but to the eastwards of it betwixt Rusnes and Haselyn, lyeth off a riffe at least two leagues into sea, which lyeth dry at the end, &amp; by it, it is very steep, close alongst by the end, it is eight fathom deep.</P>
<P>From Rusnes to Spro it is south and by east eight or nine leagues. Betwixt Rusnes and Spro lyeth Callenburch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Callen∣burgh.</NOTE> which is also a lade place, and about 2 leagues to the southwards of Callenburch lyeth a flat alongst the coast about a league from the shoare of five fathom depth, you must also avoyd the south corner of Callenburgh, for there shooteth off a riffe halfe a league into sea, there is also to the northwards a long flat alongst the shoare, but not deep to the seawards, betweene Callenburgh and Rusnes it is good lying for an easterly wind.</P>
<P>From the east end of Spro runneth off a little riffe or ledge of rocks, and over against it commeth also a flat shooting off from the land, betwixt them both it is foure and five fathom deep. Going on the south side of Spro it is also very foule, more then halfe a league without the shoare. But behinde or thwart of Spro lyeth Casseur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Casseur.</NOTE> a faire Haven, where men doe lie at the Kay, and let their goods be carried into the ships, where also it is betweene both fourty, fifty, and sixty fathom deepe, but in the middle of the fareway lye some banks, where there is no more then five and six fathom water, good strand ground.</P>
<P>From Spro to Langeland the course is south and south and by east foure leagues distant. He that com∣meth alongst to the eastwards of Wero, through the channell betwixt Wero &amp; Haters riffe, and will saile to Roems, let him go on due south and by east, and then he shall runne alongst about an English mile to the east∣wards of the Boltsack, and fall with the land a little to the eastwards of Roems: likewise hee that goeth from Roems, or a little to the eastwards of it, on north and by west, hee shall fall betwixt Wero and Haters riffe right in the fareway. Betwixt Roems and Fuynen you may run through in two fathom, but with great shipps you cannot goe through there.</P>
<P>From the north end of Fuynen shooteth off a little riff about an English mile into sea. About a league east and by north from Roems lyeth a shoale of 3, 4, and 5 fathom, which is steep, and shoaleth up so suddenly, that a man, not knowing of it, and finding it so by the lead, should bee affrighted at it, To the southwards of Roems, in the land of Fuynen lyeth a little towne, for

<P>From Roems to Spro, the course is southeast 5 leag. Betwixt Spro<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spro.</NOTE> and Knuytshead, it is 12, &amp; 13 fathom deep. But betwixt Roems and Spro, it is 10, &amp; 11 fathom deep.</P>
<P>Even about to the southwards of the poynt of Knuyts∣head in Buyen, lyeth the Haven of Nyburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nyburgh</NOTE> when you are about the poynt, you runne right up to the towne, about northwest, a league, there it is 6, and 7 fathom deep. Men doe lye there with ships to the Kay, and let their goods bee carried in what they will.</P>
<P>From Knuytshead to Langeland the course is south∣east 4 leagues, &amp; then you leave Spro lying on the star∣board side. From the southwest end of Spro shooteth off a little riffe which you must avoyd. At the north end of Langeland lye the little Islands of the Frissell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fris∣sell.</NOTE> which are round about very foule. From Knuytshead to the Islands Tassing, the course is south and south and by east foure leagues, and then you leave the Frissell lying on the larboard side, and run through betwixt the Frissell and Fuynen. If you be bound to Swineburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swinburg</NOTE> then go from the Frissell to the southeast end of Fuynen, on southsouthwest, and you shall meet a little Island which you may runne about on both sides of it. Through betwixt Tassing, and that little Island, or you may run alongst by the land of Fuynen, untill that you come to the little Towne of Swineburgh, which lyeth over against the Island of Tassing. Over against the poynt of Fuynen lyeth a little Island called Olms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Olmes.</NOTE> then you must goe up to the westwards. You may also runne about on the other side of Tassing, and leave the Island Arr with the foule grounds (which lye betwixt Arr and the south∣east end of Fuynen) on the larboard side of you, it is no deeper upon these grounds then six foot. Now when as that you shall come by the little Island Olms, or by the southeast poynt of Fuynen, then you must (as befo∣re is said) goe up to the westwards about the poynt of Fuynen towards Woburgh. Upon the south side of these foresayd grounds goeth also a Deepe through, west, and west and by south through betwixt the grounds and the Island Arr: upon this Island Arr lyeth a little Towne called Koping.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Koping.</NOTE> This foule ground is 3 leag. long, and that Island Arr is also 3 leagues long, they lye both of them east and west, and the Munk Island lyeth at the end of these grounds before Woburgh in Fuynen, which hath two riffes, the one shooteth off from the southeast end east into sea, the other from the north point northeast into the sea. When you saile through to the northwards of these grounds, to wit, betwixt Fuynen and these grounds, towards Woburgh, you shall also meet with the foresayd Munk, with another little Island or two more, leave them lying on the larboard side, and run all along by the land of Fuynen, about west and west and by north. Unto the poynt of Askens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Askens.</NOTE> which is about six leagues distant from the southeast poynt.</P>
<P>From the east poynt of Askens unto the little Island Toreu,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toreu.</NOTE> the course is west and by north, and westnorth∣west two leagues, and to Areu westsouthwest 3 leagues, these two little Islands lye one over against the other, the one on the side of Jutland, and the other on the side of Fuynen, men runne through there betwixt 2 riffs which run off one against the other, it is there 4 and 5 fathom deep.</P>
<P>To the northwards or westwards of Areu lyeth the Sound of Haddersleu,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sound of Hadder∣sleu.</NOTE> which lyeth in about west and by south, upon it lyeth the towne Haddersleu two leagues within the land.</P>
<P>From Areu or Toreu to Melversound the course is northnorthwest five leagues, which you must run into from the southwards first westwards unto the sound of Coldingen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sound off Coldingē.</NOTE> being a broad Sound, which goeth a league into the land, if you will goe through the Melversound, you must leave it on the larboard side, and goe up to the eastwards unto the towne of Melver, where you come then againe into a crooked channell. The Melversound goeth out to the northwards with a very crooked chan∣nell, and you come out againe upon the broad water to the northwards of Fuynen, as is before said. You may also sail off from Areu into the sound of Aelsem alongst southsouthwest unto Apenrade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apenrade</NOTE> and then about behind the Island of Aelsems untill you come into the sound of Flesburgh,</P>
<P>The Melversound &amp; the little Island Areu lye south∣southeast and northnorthwest one from the other.</P>
<P>To saile out of the Aelsen sound from Areu or the Melversound, then go from Areu or Toreu unto the Roen<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Roe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> eastsoutheast 3 leagues, and then through betwixt the Island and Fuynen, that is alongst to the northwards of Roen, for you can not goe about to the southwards of it. The Roen is a bad and shoaly riffe shooting off from Aelsen, whereunto it is fast, the outer end of it lyeth dry like Anoutriffe. From the Roen to Arr or Koping the course is east and by south 5 leagues.</P>
<P>From the south east end of Aelst shooteth off a great riffe towards Arr called the Poles riffe:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poles riffe</NOTE> you must run be∣twixt Arr &amp; that riffe, leaving two third parts of the wa∣ter on the Aelsen side, and one third part towards Arr, &amp; runne on so with the south end of Langeland, untill that you come against Copen.</P>
<P>From Arr to the south end of Langeland, the course is eastsoutheast, foure leagues. And from the Poles riffe to the south end of Langeland, the course is west &amp; west and by north six leagues. You may run through betwixt Langeland and Arr to the northwards and come out againe into the Belt by Nyburgh: from the south end of Langeland to Tassing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tassing.</NOTE> it is north six leagues; you may sail about Tassing on both sides, and leave Arr and the foule grounds, lying on the one side of you. Upon these grounds it is but 6 foot deep.</P>
<P>You may also saile through betwixt the foresayd grounds and Fuynen into the sound of Aelsen, unto the little Islands of Areu and Toreu, as hath been said here before.</P>
<P>From the little Island Areu to Apenrade the course is south and by west five leagues. The sound of Apenrade is a broad open sound, upon which lyeth the foresaid towne of Apenrade.</P>
<P>From the river of Apenrade unto the crooked chan∣nell of Sonderburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sound of Apen∣rade.</NOTE> which goeth in betwixt the Island Aelsen and the maine land, the course is east 3 leagues, there you may saile through about behinde the Island of Aelsen to Sonderburgh, and then forth into the sound of Flensburgh.

<P>The Island Lesou<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lesou.</NOTE> is compassed round about with foule Dwaelgrounds, riffs and sands, that lye off. From the southeast end where the Church stands upon, lyeth off such a great riffe or shoale from the shoare, that aboute 3 leagues from the land to the southwards of it, it is not deeper then two fathom, there under it you may make rode for a southsoutheast winde. Likewise from the southwest poynt, lyeth off such a great shoale, that when the foresayd flatt church is east, and eastnortheast from you, you cannot come neare the land within three leagues. But the north end you may come so near, that you may have rode under it for a southerly &amp; southeast winde, in three, four, five, sixe and seven fathom, the church being about south from you.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe of Lesou.</NOTE>From the northeast end lyeth off also a riffe right towardes the Trindel, which you may sound about, when you sayle through betwixt Lesou and the Trindell, which is the nearer Lesou the shoaler, and the nearer the Trindell the deeper. Close by the Trindell on the Inner side or west side, it is deep five and six fathom.</P>
<P>The Trindell<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trindel.</NOTE> is a stony sand-plate, three cornerd, and somewhat long of fashion, it is no more then four foot deep, and about two Akers of land great, and lyeth most alongst the farewaye, lying from the northeast end of Lesou northeast, or a little more easterly about 3 leagues distant.

<P>But he that commeth sayling about the Scaw, &amp; runneth without the riffe in tenne, eleven, or twelve fathom, and goeth on from thence southeast, or south∣southeast, keepeth a long while still the depth fifteen &amp; sixteen fathom at least the space of three leagues, before he get twenty, or five and twenty fathom. When as that you beginne to get againe shoaler water of tenne, eight, seven, and six fathom, that goeth then through within the Trindell. When as you shall meete with the foresaide depth of the shoaling, and saile yet further on southsoutheast, then you must be very carefull to use your lead of then, because of the foresaid shoale, which lyeth off from the northeast end of Lesou towards the Trindell, you may runne over it (as is said) in five, foure, and so well (in the narrowe) in three fathom. When the northeast point of Lesou beginneth to come south∣southwest from you, then you come on against the riff or shoale but when the poynt is southwest from you, then you are over the shoalest of the riffe. When the west end of Lesou is southwest, and the church south∣west and by south from you, then you are about thwart of the buye of the Trindell.</P>

You may saile throug between the southermost &amp; the middlemost, but then you must runne nearest the southermost, through betwixt them is four fathom water.</P>
<P>Under the Helmes is good road for southeast, south∣southeast &amp; southerly windes. He that will go to anchor under them, comming from the Scawe, must runne to the strand in three fathom, and runne so alongst by it, in betweene the strand and the Helmes, untill that he be within the rockes, there he may anchor, he may also well runne through alongst by the footstrand in 3 fathom. When the rockes of the Helms are east, &amp; east &amp; by north from you, there is the road in 4 fathom &amp; 4 fathom &amp; a half. The best road for to ly under the Helms with small ships, is betwixt the southermost &amp; middle most lit∣tle Island, somwhat nearer the main land then the Islands: but for great ships it is best to lye by the Grasholme.</P>
<P>He that will not lye so farr within the Helmes, may also anchor farther out under the high land of Lacklou, so that the Helms bee southeast from him, in four, five, or seven fathom, there it is also verie good lying for south &amp; southsoutheast windes, in clean ground of small white and black sand.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Scawe and the Helmes in the farewaye it is deep eighteen, sixteen, and fifteene fathom. Betwixt the Helmes and the maine land, there is at the shoalest three fathom water. When you come from the north∣wardes through betwixt them untill you come thwart of the south end of the rockes, there runneth off a little riffe from the Helmes towards the strand, where the greate stones lye called Bourser riffe, but keeping in three fathom, you cannot take hurt of that riffe. You may well run out againe by that south end towards Zea∣buy. So that you may sayl round about the Helmes with shippes that are not of very great draughts.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Helmes and Lesou, a good wayes from the Helmes, it is 20 &amp; 25 fathom deep, soft ground, but one league from the Helms lye some rocks or shoals, where of you must take heed.</P>
<P>To the westwardes of Lesou lye the Dwaelgrounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dwael∣grounds.</NOTE> to the northwards of the foresaid riff, that lyeth off from the southwest point of Lesou, where the flat church standeth upon.

<P>About a league northnorthwest from the west end of Lesou, southsoutheast somewhat southerly from the point of the Scaw, &amp; eastsouthe. from the little Helmes,
<PB N="27" REF="56"/> there lye two or three little low Islands or rocks, a little above water; betwixt these Holmkens, and the Helms, it is twenty fathom, but betwixt these Holmkens and Lesou five fathom deep, to the northwards of them is farre flat, four and five fathom deepe sand ground.</P>
<P>If you wil sayl by night off from the Helmes or from the high land of Lacklie towards Lesou with a southwest or southsouthwest winde, then sayle no nearer because of these little Islands and shoals then southeast and by east, with that course you shall run over those shoals or flats (lying to the northwards from the foresayd Holm∣kens) in six or seven fathom, afterwards it wil be deeper again, nine, ten and twelve fathom, go then on east∣southeast so long untill that the east end of Lesou be southwest from you. When that east end beginneth to come south and by west from you, then you come on against that flat, or rif, which shooteth off from the northeast end of Lesou towards the Trindell. It doth shoale up from 14, 12, and 10 fathom, unto 8, 6, and four, and also to three fathom. If you be somewhat near to Lesou, three fathom lasteth a good whiles, and then it will be again deeper, four, six, tenne and fifteene fathom, and then verie deep. When that fore∣sayd northeast end of Lesou is southwest from you, then you are cleare of that flat. The Helmes and the Trindel lie east &amp; by south and west and by north seven leagues asunder.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail within the Trindell.</NOTE>When you come from the Scaw with a southwest or westsouthwest winde, and that you will sail through within the Trindel, that is, betwixt the Trindel and Lesou, it is best that you goe such a course, that you may make your wayes good southeast and by south, and then you shall run alongst about the middest of the channel, through betwixt the Trindel, and the foresayd low rockes, (which lye northnorthwest off from the north poynt of Lesou, and southsoutheast from the poynt of the Rif of the Scaw.) At the deepest in this farewaye, betwixt the Scaw and Lesou, it is 23 and 24 fathom, being past over that, you shall come against a banck of eight, seven, and six, and also into five fathom. and then you shall be about due west, or a little more northerly or southerly from the buye upon the Trindel. Afterwards it wil be again deeper, if you be in the right fareway, to witt, seven, eight, ten, and also wel twelve fathom.</P>
<P>Not for to sayl within the riff, or the northeast poynt of Lesou, it is good to run then somewhat more easterly, to witt, southeast or southeast and by east, untill you come against the foresayd riff that lyeth off from the northeast poynt of Lesou, which you may sound, and so runne about by it in five, four, and also three fathom. When the northeast poynt of Lesou, (that is the poynt with hommocks) is south &amp; by west from you, then you come against the rif, &amp; when that poynt is southsouthwest from you, then you are right thwart of the rif, but when the poynt is southwest from you, then you shall be past and cleare of the rif. Being gotten about it towardes Anoute, it will be deepe thirtie, five and thirtie, and also fortie fathom.</P>
<P>He that commeth by night about the Trindell, must not spare his lead, on the outer side, that is on the east side of the Trindle you may not come nearer it by night, then nine or tenne fathom, and then you shall not befarre off from it.</P>
<P>When you sayle close alongst without the Trindell in cleare weather, and that you stande without board, upon the bendes of the shippe with your feet by the water, then you can even see Lesou. If that then in cleare weather standing so without the ship, you cannot see Le∣sou, when you are about thwart of the Trindle then you runne farre enough alongst without the Trindle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Depths betwixt Anout &amp; Lesou.</NOTE>The Trindle and the riffe of Anout lye northwest and southeast, or as some say southsoutheast and northnorth∣west nine or tenne leagues a sunder. Betwixt Anoute and Lesou in the right farewaye it is five &amp; twentie fathom deep, but to the westwards of it, to wit, right betwixt the Islands Anout and Lesou it is shoale water; of seven and eight fathom, you may sayle there over these flats and shoals through betwixt Anout and Lesou into the Belt.</P>
<P>Anout is upon the west side verie foule, and farre off to seawards from it, lye manie uneven dwaelgrounds of two, three and four fathom.</P>
<P>When you saile with a southwest or westerly winde from Lesou to Anout, and runne over the flat of Lesou in three or four fathom, you neede not sayle on more easterly then southeast and by east, although it be by night, you shall with such winde and course run cleare enough of Anout. When as that you reckon to have the length of the riffe, goe then on southsoutheast; and south and by east, for to sail a wether of Coll. But by day or when you can see about you, not more leewardly then southsoutheast. When you saile off from the fore∣sayd pointe of Lesou to Anout, with a southwest or west∣southwest winde, as is before said &amp; make reckoning to come by night by Anout, then you can not doe better; as to goe eight, tenne or twelve glasse, (according as the winde shall blow fresh) on southsoutheast, untill you come against the shoaling of Anout, and looke for the daye, that running not to far to leewards off the poynt of the riffe, you may the better gett a weather of Col. Likewise, when you come off from Col with a south∣west or southerly winde, and runne about a halfe league alongst without Coll, you neede not also saile more northerly, then northwest and by north, that goeth also a good waye alongst to leewards of Anout riffe, and so forth towards Lesou. But when you come with a north∣east wind out of the Sound, or from Col, you must runne out close by Coll, if you will sail a weather of the riffe of Anout.</P>
<P>He that must lye by or turne to windwardes betwixt Lesou and Anout, and is bound for the Sound, let him keepe himselfe on the west side of the farewaie, when he is a league or two a weather of Lesou, upon those foresaid flattes, or foure, sixe, and seven fathom, when as that he beginneth to come within a league or two of Anout, there it will be again deeper, but uneven the one cast at least a fathom more or lesse then the other, when that you shall begin to get that uneven ground of six∣teene, twentie, and also thirtie fathom, then is Anout yet about three leagues south from you; comming neare Anout it wil be verie uneven, at one time thirtie, and then soone againe fifteene, seventeene, &amp; also twenty fathom.</P>
<P>If you will saile towards Lesou with a southwest win∣de, comming about the Riffe of Anout from the south∣wardes, then goe not on more westerly then northwest. If you goe on more westerly, eyther westnorthwest, or northwest and by west, then you shall come soon upon the flatte betwixt Anout and Lesou, and shall finde first tenne, and then by little and little six, five and four fathom. When that with the northwest waye you beginne to gette Lesou in sight, then it lyeth high, that is, the west end about westnorthwest, and the northeast end, where the riffe lyeth off, about north∣northwest from you. When you come so neere to Le∣sou, that you can see the east end out of the toppe in cleare weather, about northwest from you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depths by Lesou.</NOTE> there it is thirtie, and four and thirtie fathom deepe, that lasteth so long untill that the foresayd east poynt be southwest from you, but when that poynte is southsouthwest from you, then you are right thwart or upon the poynte or shoalest, of the riff, then you shall runne over there in three, four, and five fathom: when that foresayd poynt commeth to be south and by west from you then you are past and cleare of the riffe.</P>
<P>Betwixt Anout and Waesbergen in the farewaye it is deepe one and twentie, two and twentie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depths thwart of Anout.</NOTE> and three and twentie fathom, betwixt them lyeth also a banck of ten twelve, fourteene and sixteene fathom. When the northermost high hill of Waesbergen is northeast
<PB N="28" REF="57"/> from you, then the poynts of Anouts riffes are south∣west from you: but when that hill is northeast and by east from you, and that you be somewhat nearer Nor∣waye then the riffe, then you are upon that bank. When you come upon it by night, then goe on south, or south and by east, according as the winde shall bee, &amp; then you shall get againe deeper water. There lyeth yet another banck betwixt the riffe of Anout &amp; Valcken∣burgh, which lyeth alongst unto Haland, which at some places is not deeper then eight fathom. When the poynt of the riffe is about south and by east, and the high land of Anout is about south and by west from you four lea∣gues, there lyeth also a banck of 14 or 15 fathom.</P>
<P>The riffe of Anout<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe off Anout.</NOTE> lyeth off from the northeast poynt of Anout about eastnortheast a league and half into sea, and at the end lyeth drye above water, which is excee∣ding steepe and needle too. The north side (when you come from the northwardes or the westwardes) you may sound, and runne alongst by it, in seventeene or eighteene fathom: but comming from the southwards, you cannot (in no wise) come neare it by your lead, for on the south side close to the Riff, it is thirty, and five and thirty fathom deepe.</P>
<P>On the north side of the riffe, you may anchor at many places in ten, eleven, twelve, and thirteen fathom. When you anchor in eleven, twelve or thirteene fathom, so that the firebeacon be southeast and by south, and the high land of Anout,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der Anout riffe.</NOTE> which is the west end, about southwest and by west from you, then lyeth the outer∣most end of the riffe east &amp; by north from you, there is verie good lying for eastsoutheast, southeast, south, and southsouthwest windes. When you set sayle from thence, &amp; are bound to the Sound, then you may boldly with∣out feare (either by night or darke weather) sayl alongst by the riffe in sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen fathom, untill thwart of the end, keeping in such depth you can take no hurt of it. Comming by the end, it is four and twenty and five and twenty fathom deepe, but when you come about the poynt, and beginne to goe on south∣southeast, then you have presently close to the riffe no ground in thirty and five and thirty fathom. The riffe of Anout and Col lye one from the other southeast and northwest about ten leagues asunder. In cleare weather you may easily see from belowe both Coll and Anout, when you are betwixt them both.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depths betwixt Anout riff and the Sound.</NOTE> For to sayle from the riffe to the Sound with a westsouthwest winde, you need not sayle nearer with a ship that sayleth wel, then southsoutheast, with that course you shall sayl farre enough a weather of Col. Comming neare the Coast of Zealand, that you may sound in fourteene, twelve, tenne &amp; eight fathom deepe.</P>
<P>Betwixt Anout &amp; Zealand, in the farewaye it is eight∣teene and twenty fathom deep. Betwixt Anout and Zealand fifteen and sixteen fathom, but in the farewaye betwixt Anout and Coll, it is deep twenty, one and twenty, two and twenty, &amp; three and twenty fathom. To the southwards of the westwardes of it, it is shoaler, to witt, nineteen, eighteen, and also well fourteen, thirteen, and twelve fathom, according as you come to the westwards, but towardes Norwaye it is deeper, to witt, four and twenty, five and twenty, eight &amp; twenty, and also thirty fathom, whereby you may perceive whether you be nearest the Norway side to the eastward of the fareway or to the westward.</P>
<P>About northwest from Coll four leagues, and south∣east and by east from Anout, there lyeth a banck of nine, tenne and twelve fathom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers∣bancks.</NOTE>About east and by south from Anout, so far that you cannot well see it from beneath, but may see it out of the top and northwest from Coll there lyeth also a banck of sixteen fathom, grosse sandy ground, as if it where ground of the riffe.</P>
<P>South and by east about eight leagues from the poynt of Arnouts riffe, southeast and by south from the south end of Anout, and west and by north from Coll about five leagues, lye the Lowsegroundes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Louse∣ground.</NOTE> upon which is no more then eight foot water. He that commeth off from Anout riffe, being bound for the Sound, and goeth not more southerly then southsoutheast, shall not sayle with∣in these grounds, but with a south &amp; by east course he should fall with them. He that commeth out of the Sound, being bound towards Anout, should (with a west∣northwest course off from the Sound) also sayle within the same, therefore he that is bound with a bare winde from Anout to the Sound, or from the Sound to Anout, must be carefull thereof.</P>
<P>The Island Haselin<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haselin.</NOTE> lyeth from Anouts riffe south 11 leagues distant, and from Coll southwest &amp; by west eight leagues, which is on the north side, or outer side very full off riffes and shoales, but on the south side or inner side towards Zealand it is indifferent clean, so that you may well have roade there. From the east end of Haselin lyeth off a Riffe northnortheast and northeast and by north towardes Norwaye three leagues into sea, untill within a league near to the Lowsegrounds: he that must turne to windewardes here, with southerly or northerly windes, and runneth somewhat far over west∣wardes into the bay, must be very carefull, and take heed there of, because it is there abouts very uneven of depths, &amp; uneven grounds, and therefore you cannot wel come neare then by your lead; but the Coast of Zealand you may come neare in 6 or 7 fathom by your lead.</P>
<P>If it should happen that you must lye by,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depths in the Scawe reach.</NOTE> in the Scawe reach in long darke nights or mistie weather, then observe these directions following: If you be betwixt the Scawe &amp; Lesou, then you may keepe your self well bouldly to the southwards or westwards, but use the lead much: about the Helmes and the Scawe you may come neare the shoare into ten, twelve or fiftteene fathom, before you need to east about. If you be by your reckoning thwart of Lesou, you may come neare it in ten or fifteen fathom: But if you be betwixt Lesou and Anout, there you may runne upon the flats in five, six, seven, eight or tenne fathom. If you be betwixt Anout Haselin and Coll, there you may runne to the south shoare in fifteene and sixteene fathom, but betwixt Haselin and Zealand in ten or twelve fathom.</P>
<P>It is best in anie wise to keepe you rather to the south shoare, then to the Norwaye side, but you must be verie careful of your lead, and use it verie much.</P>
<P>From Coll to the Island Haselin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haselin.</NOTE> it is southwest and by west eight leagues, you may sayle through betwixt Haselin and Zealand, untill you come into the Belt: the coast of Zealand is a faire strand, but betweene Fishers village and the Castle Kronenburgh, lyeth a banke a lit∣tle halfe league from the shoare of two fathom, and run∣neth with a riffe to the shoare and is foure fathom wa∣ter, as also, to the westwards of Haselin, there shooteth off a riffe to seawards, which you must avoyd.</P>
<P>About eastsoutheast from Haselin goeth into the Land a great broad sound, which without at the entrance of it, is a great league broad, there is good anchoring for a northwest winde in five or six fathom. The Sound divideth it selfe within the land into three parts, the first or the eastermost, called Roskildifiourd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roskildi∣fiourt</NOTE> goeth up south∣southeast unto Rockil, the second, called Isenvoort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isenvoort</NOTE> lyeth into the land south, and south and by west at least 5 or 6 leagues, unto Isickby and Holbeck: within it is at least two leagues broad, and in the middest lyeth a great Island. The third lyeth to Draecksholme, also at least five leagues southwest, and northeast, like the coast towards the Belt. The Coast of Zealand, betwixt Haselin and the Sound is a clean coast, you may sayle alongst by the Land in six or seven fathom, besides the foresayd riff which lyeth betweene Fishers village there is upon it but four fathom deep, but come no nearer to it by night then twelve or thirteene fathom, for at some places it is steep, &amp; shoaleth up suddenly. Where that little new church standeth, thwart of it, it is flat three and foure fathom, and to the westwards of that wood which stan∣deth
<PB N="29" REF="57"/> to the westwards of Lapsand, you may come in foure fathom by the shoare, without taking hurt, but comming neare Lapsand, you must keepe further off from the shoare, in seven or eight fathom, or els you should get behinde the poynte of Lappesand.</P>
<P>Lappesand<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lappe∣sand.</NOTE> lyeth about an English mile to the north∣wards of Elsenoore, or the Castle of the Sound, lying on the west side of the sayle way, alongst the coast of Zealand. For to avoyd Lappesand you must be care∣full of these marks, there standeth a house to the west∣wards of the Kings mill, to the westwardes of the Castle of Cronenburgh, keep the Chimney of that house to the westwards of the front of the Kings mill, and then you can take no hurt of Lappesand, then runne alongst by it in six, seven or eight fathom, so long untill that the east end of the Island Ween commeth a little without the castle of the Sound, keepe that so standing, and sayle so in sixe or seven fathom, somewhat close alongst by the castle, you may playnly see lying through the water all that can hurt you.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to an∣chor be∣hinde Lap¦pesand.</NOTE>If you will shift roads out of the Sound, &amp; anchor be∣hinde Lappesand, then sayle thwart of the foresayd Kings house called the Caux or Kings mill, so that it doe stande about south or south and by west, or south and by east from you, anchor there in six, seven or eight fathom, there it is good lying out of the current and sand ground but if you will anchor in twelve, thirteen or fourteen fa∣thom, there it is soft ground, and there goeth a strong current with southerly or southeast windes, but you lye there better, in more roome, for to sayle inwardes againe if it should happen that the winde did suddenly shift out to the northwest. It happened once to one of may acquaintance, that had anchored somewhat to the east∣wards of the Kings-mill, in sixe or seven fathom and the winde did shift in the night to the northwest, when they weighed their anchor the shippe fell towards the land, &amp; before they could get the ship about before the winde, they did runne in three fathom over the poynt of Lappe∣sand.</P>

Thwart of Draker it is uneven for to sound, the one cast five and the other foure fathom, but go your course, except you knew that you where neerer the one shoare of Draker, or the south holmes, then the other. Without Draker it will be againe 6 and 7 fathom deep. Full south∣east from Draecker, about a good halfe league lyeth a stone, three foote under water, and is about 2 rods length from the greate where Cornelis Iansz Buysman, from the streeck in September 1628 run upon with his shipp.</P>
<P>For to saile into Rifsholl or Copenhaven, comming from the northwards out of the sound; runne along somewhat to the westwards of the Norther buye, for to avoyd the plate, or Middle ground, which lyeth to the westwardes of the buyes in the shoals, which upon the north end is not deeper then twelve foote, and on the south end eight, nine, and at some places ten foot deep, all hard stony and rocky ground, keepe the sounding of the shoare on the west side in two, three, or foure fathom, so deep as you please, untill you come before Copenhaven, on that side you can take no hurt, it is there broad and wide, and lyeth in south &amp; by west; in the middest betwixt the shoare and the Middle-ground, it is 5, 6, and 7 fathom deep. If you should turne to windwardes there, then come not neerer the middle∣ground then in foure fathom, but the west shoare you may runne to by your lead, as you please.</P>
<P>From the north end of the Island Draecker, runneth off a riffe to the northwards, upon the poynt of that riffe lyeth a buye, which men do call the buye in the Reefsholl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buye in- the Reefs hol.</NOTE> leave that on the larboard side, and run in, untill you come before the towne, and anchor there. If you come from the southwards, and will saile unto Reefsholl, then run alongst to the eastwards of the fore∣said fourth buy (which men do call the buye upon Casper Caniel) then luffe up presently about by it, and go on northwest into the Kings-deep, unto the buye in Reefs∣holl, which lye one from the other due northwest, and southeast: you shall then also see right out a head, in the northwest within the land a flat steeple right over a great house or Hospital, that standeth close upon the sea-side, keepe them so one in the other, and saile right in with them, and so you shall runne in right amidst the channell, it is there in the farewaye five, sixe, seven, &amp; eight fathom deep. This Kingsdeepe is somewhat uneven of ground, therefore be carefull in using of the lead, and come not too neere the north side; that is the Middle-ground, which is very foule and rocky: from the south shoare (about halfe wayes betwixt the two s re∣said buyes) it lyeth off somewhat shoale, of that you shall have at one cast five or sixe, &amp; the other but 3 fathom.</P>
<P>When you come by the buye in the Reefsholl, which lyeth upon the point of the norther riffe of Draecker, leave that on the larboard side, and runne on south about by it, unto Copenhaven.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Markes of the buy in the Reefs∣hol.</NOTE> The Markes of this buye are these: there lyeth a round hommock or great rock about half a league within the land, when that is right east from you, then it commeth right with a flat steeple which stands about a league within the land, then you are eventhwart of the buye, or poynt of the fore∣sayd riffe. These marks will serve at times when the buy lyeth not there. A little to the northwards of that buy lye the great ships which tarry for wind in five or six fa∣thom, there is good anchor ground.</P>
<P>From the buye upon Draker-riff unto Kuyck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kuyck.</NOTE> the course is southwest five great leagues, but unto the riff of Fasterborn, or Steden, it is south and south and by west 5 leagues, in the fareway betwixt Draecker and Fasterborn it is six, seven, and eight fathom deep, but between Fasterborn and Steden, 10, or 12, and 13 fa∣thom, but by Steden deepest.</P>
<P>Under Steden you may anchor as well to the south∣wards of it, for northerly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der Steden</NOTE> as to the northwards for sou∣therly windes. If you wil anchor for northerly winds, then run in betwixt Steden and Meun, a good wayes into the bay, so that the steep poynt of Steden lye about north∣northeast from you, anchor there in 8 or 9 fathom, and you shall lye land-lockt for north and northwest winds.</P>
<P>But if you wil anchor for south or southwest winds, then anchor to the northwardes of Steden, so that the south∣east poynt be south and by east, or southsoutheast, and the northwest poynt northwest or westnorthwest from you, there it is good lying in seven fathom, the ground is there small white and blanck sand. If you will set saile from thence to the shoales or grounds, then go not more northerly then northeast, so long untill that you come by the riffe of Draker, then run about by it in five fathom.</P>
<P>To the northwards of Steden the coast of Zealand goeth in with a great bay into Kuyck, it is there all to the westwards shoale water in five, sixe and seven fa∣thom, and good anchor ground, so that you may anchor every where there abouts.</P>
<P>The riffe of Fasterborne lyeth off southwest to Sea∣wards a league and a halfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks of the riffe of Faster∣borne.</NOTE> It is a fowle stony and rocky riffe, upon the end of it lyeth a buye in foure fa∣thom. You may run about by it upon your lead in five fathom with small ships of little draughts. Men doe hold for a marck of this riffe that when the steeple of Fa∣sterborn and the castle come one in the other, that then they are thwart of the poynt of the riffe. He that com∣meth from the northwards, and will sayle about Faster∣borne with a northerly or northeast wind, and that he will come somewhat neere about the riffe, and commeth in five or sixe fathom, he must be very quick in using the lead. When old Falsterborne Church commeth halfe wayes to the Castle and the Church of Fasterborne, then beginneth to come the worst and shoalest of the riff, that lasteth untill that Old Fasterborn church com∣meth to the eastwards of the houses of Fasterborne, be∣fore
<PB N="31" REF="58"/> that you are not past the riffe. If you should luffe up sooner about by it, you should run in great danger with a ship of great draught, you shall have (comming against the riffe) the one cast 4 or 5, and then presently three fathom upon it, all hard stony ground. Therefore it is best with a ship that draweth twelve or fourteene foote, to come no neere this riffe then in six or seven fa∣thom.</P>
<P>If (when you come from the eastwards) you will saile about Fasterborne, and come alongst the shoare with a northeast wind in six or seven fathom, and Falsterborne is about north, or northnortheast from you, then it shoaleth up very fast in two fathom, or two fathom and a halfe. Therefore keepe you further off from the shoare in tenne or twelve fathom, so long untill that the Castle be northeast, or northeast and by north from you or that old Falsterborne church come halfe way to the castle of Falsterborn and Falsterborn church, then you cannot sayle upon the riff from the eastwards, but run∣ning about by it in five fathom, then you must be very carefull in using your lead. But if you will come neere the riff in foure or five fathom, when old Falster-born Church commeth to thee. end of Falsterborn, you shall run in great danger for to come on ground. When you come within the Riffe, you may run alongst by the coast of Schoonen in four fathom without taking hurt.</P>
<P>He that commeth out of the Sound, and is bound to the southwards of Meun, may come so near Meun as he will, and loose up to the westwards by the poynt, and anchor where he please, in five or six fathom. On the north side of Meun you may also anchor in six fathom, behinde a little riffe that shooteth off from the north poynt, for an east, southsouthwest and west wind, it is there all over flatt, and good ground.</P>
<P>From Meun to Steden, the course is northwest and by north four leagues, betwixt them both goeth in the Wolf-sound, or Wolvegat, that runneth past Werden∣borgh and Nest-veld through the Golversound out into the Belt.</P>
<P>Meun and Fasterborne lye north and by east, and south and by west five leagues asunder.</P>

<P>In the Scawe reach, betwixt Maelstrand and Waers∣bergen the streame goeth most still with the winde and it rippleth there sometimes in some places, as if there were shoals, this you may finde in calme weather, if you let a lead sinke to the ground.</P>

<P>In this farewaye betwixt the Scawe and the Sound, &amp; then from the Sound untill about Fasterborne, it is excee∣ding necessarie that a Pilot (or he to whom the charge is committed) be very carefull in looking out, &amp; be very vigilant, that he may avoide the multitude of daungers, of shoales and riffes lying there: the skilfullest and best experienced of all hath there enough to doe.</P>
<P>Through the Sound and the shoales or groundes, the streame runneth commonly with the winde, but the most part of the time to the northwards, before the comming of a hard east winde, or when it hath blowne out of the east, then the streame runnes still out the northwards.</P>

Being within there, you may run to the eastwards againe into sea, and come out in the Sound of Sand-voordt.</P>
<P>About a league to the eastwards of Trom-sound lyeth the haven of Oxeford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxeford.</NOTE> which is a great broad, and large Sound, lying in first without betwixt the rock, north.

If you run in so out of the sea, right with the Drommels, you shall fall right with Maerdow, that is a certain mark to know whether you be thwart of Maer∣dow, or to the eastwards or the westwards of it, but when you are close before the land, or before the havens mouth, you cannot see the Drommels, because they are then hidden of the cliffeland. To anchor under the Island there is the shoalest water, but with a northwest or northnorthwest winde, it is not so good to come from thence as out of the haven, but with an easterly winde it is better to set sail from thence and to get into sea.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into Maer∣dow, through within the Mew∣holmes.</NOTE>With a bare winde, or otherwise, you may sayle also in, to this wester-gat of Maerdow, to the westwards of Miewholmes, thus: To the westwards of the souther∣most Miewholme, not farre from it, lye two little rocks, even above water, and a little further off from in two other rockes which are somewhat greater, you must runne in amidst the channell through betwixt them, leaving the two smallest lying on the starboard side, and the two greatest on the larboard side, that channell lyeth through most north and north and by east. Being come to the end of the Miewholmes; you may sayle up either towards the northeast behinde the Island Maerdow, or westwards into the Haven, as is beforesayd. There goeth sometimes a good tyde out of this Haven, and the westerly windes doe blow com∣monly out of this channell betwixt the high lands there∣fore he that will come in here with a westerly winde, must be very carefull, and keep up his top sailes, or els he should lightly not be able to get the haven, but drive out of it against his will.</P>
<P>Thwart of the west end of the Island Maerdow<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maerdow</NOTE> lyeth a suncken rock under water, whereof you must take heed, when you sayle in thus to the eastwards of the Mieuholmes.

In the going into the Sound, or haven, it is 34 fathom deep.</P>
<P>The Island Maerdow standeth (upon the top of it) full of trees, and round about it are all bare rockes. On each side of the Island goeth in a channell. The wester gatt or channell goeth into the westwardes of the Island, and the easter gatt to the eastwardes of it. For to sayle into the wester gatt, you must leave the Mewholmes (they are a fow rocks and Islands to the westwardes of the Island of Maerdowe) on the larboard side, and the Island on the starboard side, and run in so betwixt them both northwest and by north, but with a southwest wind, you must sayle in northwest.

<P>On the west side of the havens mouth lyeth a suncken rock under water, called the Koenagle, upon the land stand two little mastes, when they come one in the other, then you are thwart of the Koenagle. The two foresayd little mastes, stand upon a gray Holme, leave that on the starboard side, and go so still inwardes, there it is high land, and the Drommels lye from thence northnorthwest within the land, there you may sayle through within the rocks, untill you come into Maer∣dow.</P>

You may runne from thence to the eastwards of the Island Fleckerie, out againe at the Easter-gatt eastnortheast into sea, and then you must leave the little Island within the Warders, which lyeth at the east end of the Island Fleckerie, with all the greate rockes by it on the star∣board side, and all the black holmes on the larboard side.</P>
<P>The Easter-gatt of Fleckerie goeth in westnorthwest, betwixt the Island Fleckerie and the poynt of Ransound. When you come before it, you may see open in the Vosse. For to sayle in there, you must leave all the black rocks thwart of the poynte of Ransound on the starboard side, &amp; the greate graye rockes with the little Island, where the Warders stand upon, on the larboard side, when as you come then by the forenamed Dieven∣holme, you must runne to the westwards of it into the Sandbay, aod anchor there, as is beforesaid.</P>
<P>When you are thwart of the Easter-gatt of Fleckerie, then there lyeth right thwart from you within the land a high round hill, which men doe call the Boate turned up side downe, which lieth out above all the lands there∣abouts, and comming from the westwards against Flec∣kerie, there shewe also three high double lands, which by little and little seeme to goe to nothing towards the Drommels.</P>

<P>A little to the eastwards of Sparrels lyeth a haven called Scarsound, or Westrysen, for to sayle in there, you must leave Sparrels to the westwards on the larboard side, and all the great Holmes or rocks to the eastwards on the starboard side, and runne so inwards untill you come into the haven.</P>
<P>From the Naze (that is the southermost poynt of Norwaye on the north sea) westwards, the coast lyeth somewhat alongst by the land of Leest, westnorthwest; but to the eastwards of it (alongst without the rockes, untill past the Island Fleckerie) eastnortheast about ten leagues. From thence alongst northeast unto the Long∣sound about 16 leagues. This coast is all alongst full of high steepe stonie hilles and without it full of manie rockes verie strange to behold, but it hath manie faire deep Havens, with verie good anchor ground, where in great abundance of timber and boards laden. The first Haven to the eastwards of the Naze,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kloof Cowe &amp; Calfe.</NOTE> is called the Kloof or the Cowe &amp; Calfe, after two high hommockes, easy to be knowne, the one somewhat greater then the other, which lye within the Haven upon the high land, and are so called by the Dutch Schippers. He that will sayle into this Haven comming from the westwardes, shall meete with a great rock somewhat to the east∣wardes of the Naze, called Melyn, where upon is a Warder, being past that he shall find another outrock, where upon standeth also a Warder, called Sparrels. Betwixt these two outrockes, he must runne into this haven the Kloof. When he commeth against Sparrels, there lyeth a suncken rock under water, where of hee must take heed. Somewhat within Sparrels lyeth an other Rock in the farewaye, but above water, which he must leave on the larboard side. In sayling in so, the haven doth open it self, by little and little, and so shall come against the Kloof: being come within it he must edge up to the westwards, about the poynt, and anchor there in a sand baye, in fifteen or sixteen fathom, so that the two foresayd hommocks the Cowe and the Calfe stande about northeast from him.</P>

<P>Although the water on these Coasts of Norway doth ebbe and flow beyond Bergen as farre as Stadt never∣thelesse it keepeth no certaine tyde, in sometimes of the yeare and principally in the Spring time there goeth such a strong streame about west alongst Norway that a ship having a southwest storme shall not bee able to stem it, when it can beare sayle. How nearer you come under the land of Norway so much the stronger goeth the streame. This streame falleth out of the Belt, on against the land from the northeast, and turneth so alongst by the Coast of Norway towards the north Sea.

<HEAD>The sixth Demonstration, In which Are set forth the Coast of Norway, between the Naze and Schuytenes.</HEAD>
<P>A Little to the westwards of the poynt of the Naze lye two havens, New and Old Silloe, or Silleu; some doe call these one haven (like as also men may doe) and distinguish it into an easter and westergat or Haven, for men can goe with boats through within the rockes from the one into the other, but not with great ships.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Silloe.</NOTE>For to sayle into the easter-gat, or New Siloe you must take heede of the Bishops Boeden, which are a few out-rocks a little to westwards of the poynt of the Naze, right before the middest of the Sound, leave them on the larboard side, &amp; sayle in alongst by the land of the Naze untill you come somewhat within the foresayd Bishops Boede, and then you shall find there also a suncken rock, which you must avoyd, run about to the northwards of it and edge then up to the westwardes behinde the Island of New Silloe, and anchor there against the white Church within the foresayd rock.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the wester-gat, or Old Silloe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Silloe</NOTE> you must run about to the westwards of the out-rocks, and Bishops-Boeden, and sayle right with the south end of the land of Leest;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Land of Leest.</NOTE> being come by it, run to the eastwards alongst by it, but take heed of some rocks, which lye off from the innermost Island on the starboard side, being there within anchor against the Island, where you please.</P>
<P>From the Naze to the Island Hitteroe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hitteroe.</NOTE> or Hittereu, the coast lyeth alongst the land of Leest westnorthwest 5 leagues. To the southwards or the westwards of that Island men doe sayle into the haven of Windfoord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Windfort</NOTE> which lyeth in northeast, but to the northwards of it men doe run into Berg-sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Berg-sound.</NOTE> eastnortheast in betwixt the Island and the land.</P>
<P>In that Island is also a good haven, which you must sayle into from the northwards, the havens mouth is not very wide when you are come in within it, you may edge up to the eastwards or southwards, and anchor there.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northwardes of Hitteroe lyeth a haven called Soggendall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soggen∣dall.</NOTE> there lyeth a little Island be∣fore it, within men may anchor, it is a good road for them which are bound to the southwards. Betwixt them both, not farre without the land, lye two out-rocks alongst the shoare, called Fock-stones, the one lyeth a little more to the seawards then the other.</P>
<P>A league to the northwards of Soggendall lyeth Eke∣sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ekesound</NOTE> before it lyeth an Island, which you may sayle in∣to on both sides of it, the southergat lyeth in northeast; being come in there you must anchor on the north side of the haven in a bay, there is the best road in eight or nine fathom, the norther gat lyeth into the eastwards; being come in there, you may anchor at divers places. Two leagues to the northwards of Ekesound lyeth a haven called Sirowach.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sierowag.</NOTE></P>
<P>For to saile in there, comming from the northwards; you must run in right with the southermost sand bay untill you come close by the shoare, and then the haven doth open it selfe, loof up close alongst by the north shoare, then run up by it to the southwards, and avoyd the west point, thwart of it lyeth a suncken rock twelve foot under water; being there within, let your anchor fall in seven or eight fathom, and bring a cable on the west shoare, then you shall lye land-lockt for all windes. This is a good haven for those which are bound to the northwards.</P>
<P>To the northwards of Sierowach lyeth the land the Jedder, which lyeth from Sierowach first northwest and by north two great leagues to point Walbert, or Mids-Iedder, and the north four leagues, which is altogether a clean whole coast, without any dangers or havens, except at the very north end, from which run∣neth off a little riffe northwest into sea, towards the Veetstone.</P>
<P>The Veetstone<NOTE PLACE="marg">Veetstone</NOTE> is a great rock; lying about two leag. without the land, lying northnorthwest from Mids-Ied∣der five leagues, betwixt them both, a great league to the southwards of the Veetstone, ly some low black roc∣kes, called Rut. When as you saile from Mids-Iedder on northnorthwest towards the Veetstone, then the Veetstone doth shew himselfe very round, like a hay∣cock, and sayling so, you might lightly fall with the foresayd rocks of Rut,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rut.</NOTE> but being a little more to sea∣wards, the Veetstone sheweth it self a little longer on the west side, then you cannot take hurt of the rocks of Rut.</P>
<P>About two leagues northnorthwest from the Veet∣stone lyeth an Island, whereupon standeth a Church called Whitings eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitings-eye.</NOTE> but northnortheast from the Veet∣stone 4 leagues, lyeth another Island before the sound of Stavanger, called Sibrichstone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sibrich∣stone.</NOTE></P>
<P>If you will saile into Stavanger comming from the southwards, then sayle through betwixt the Veetstone and the maine land, leaving also the foresayd rockes of Rut, lying on the starboard side, but you must take very good heed of that little stone-riffe which lyeth off from the north end of the Iedder; sayle in so untill that the Veetstone doe lye southwest from you, then goe in northeast towards the poynt of Tongenes, which is a long point and low land on the south side of the Sound.</P>
<P>When as you sayle now from the Veetstone towards Tongenes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tongene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> then you shall see that Island Sibrich stone before the Sound, which doth shew it self in two parts, leave that on the larboard side, and sayle in by the point of Tongenes, but there lyeth a rock off to the north∣wards from the poynt: sayle through betwixt the rock and the poynt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doeswyk</NOTE> about east or eastsoutheast into Does∣wycke; when you are within the castle of Doeswycke, there you may anchor. But if you will sayle in further before the town of Stavanger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stavanger</NOTE> then leave the Diefholm on the starboard side, and sayle in southeast and south∣southeast before the towne, and anchor there where you please.</P>
<P>But when as you come from the northwards, and will sayle to Stavanger, then run through betwixt the Veet∣stone &amp; the Whitings-eye, &amp; then goe on northeast to∣wardes Sibrichstone, and the poynt of Tongenes, and doe further as hath been before taught.</P>
<P>From the Veetstone to Schuytenes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schuyte∣nes.</NOTE> the course is northnorthwest five leagues: but from Schuytenes to Sibrichstone through betwixt Whitings-eye, the course is east, five leagues.</P>

<P>BEtwixt Schuytenesse &amp; Bock goeth in the Liet of Bergen. Schuytensse is about foure leagues long, at the south end lye some suncken rockes and fowle grounds; for to avoyd them comming in out of the sea, you must keep the top of Bock a little without the poynt of Schuytenesse, and then you shall goe cleare of them; But if you bring Bock close by or to the poynt of Schuytenesse, and saile so right in for to runne about close by the poynt of Schuytenesse, you shall surely sayle upon those foresayde suncken Rocks and fowle grounds.</P>

At the comming in to this Baye lyes a sunken rock, called the Coppernaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Copper∣naile.</NOTE> upon it standeth alwayes a great Pole, where by you may see to avoyd it.</P>
<P>Without at the south point of Schuytenes on the east side is also a little Bay or two, where men may anchor.</P>
<P>A little to the northwardes of Bock, on the east side of the Liet is also a Bay, called Bock-haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bock-Haven.</NOTE> where men may come to anchor.</P>
<P>All these roads, as also the Coperwycke, are good for those which comming from the southwardes, by reason of contrary winds can not get to the great Warders.</P>
<P>A little more southerly then the Coperwycke, on the east side of the Liet to the northwardes of the Bock, lyeth in north into the land, a Sound, which sheweth it self (when you come from the southwardes) much broader then the right fareway, so that those that are not there very well acquainted, should not think other∣wise, but that it was the right channell, and so should lightly go up a contrary way. Therefore it is necessary &amp; needfull to sayl close alongst by Schuytenes, and not goe off from the west shoare, untill you come thwart of Coperwycke, then you shall be within the point of the foresayd Sound.</P>

<P>About a great halfe league by north the great War∣der, lyeth Notou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notou.</NOTE> there standeth a little white church and some houses, thwart of it in the Bay is also good anchoringh for northerly winds, and good road for them which are bound to the northwardes. Likewise se it is good anchoring by north the poynt of Notou, for them which are bound to the southwards. Almost at the north end of Schuytenesse, is also a road, called Sichstreame, where is also good lying.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sich∣stream.</NOTE>At the north end of Schuytenesse lyeth a little Island, when you sayle up or downe the Lieth, you can see through betwixt them into sea. At this Island is alsoo a good road under a rocke, or Island, called Wybrants-eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wybrants eye.</NOTE> there it is good anchoring for all windes.</P>
<P>Betwixt that foresaid Island and the maine land, you must saile through a narrow strait, which is but a little more then a shippes length broad; on the east side where of, which is on the side of the maine land, there lyeth a little rock; or suncken rock, therefore you must saile close by the west side that is close alongst by the Island for to avoyd the foresayde rock.</P>
<P>From Wybrants-eye over the Bommel<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bom∣mell.</NOTE> to the Blocx, the course is northnorthwest, but first somewhat more westerly, about two leagues, betwixt them both it is on the west side a broken land, great and little Islands and rockes. About halfe wayes betwixt them both goeth a channell into sea, where men doe sayle much in &amp; out, and it is cleane, broad, and wide. He that will runn out there (comming from the northwards) may easily espye it, when he is a halfe league past the Blocx. On the west side lye two little Islands or great rockes, which shew much greater then the other rocks, these you must leave on the larboard side, and run out by them southsouth∣west into the sea.</P>
<P>He that will runne in here out of the sea, he shall (when he commeth to the end of Schuytenesse) see many little Islands or rocks, he must saile past al these, untill that he get sight of those foresayd two great rocks, and then in by them leaving them on the starboard side; &amp; so he shall come somwhat to the southwardes of the Blocx<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Blocx</NOTE> or Longholme into the Lieth.</P>
<P>The Blocx are 2 rockes, lying very neare even with the water, which you must leave on the larboard side, in sailing up, and runne close alongst by the east shoare, through betwixt the Blocx and Longholm.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Long∣holm.</NOTE> Longholme lyeth a little above the Blocx, within it is a good Haven, where is good lying. A little to the northwards of it lye 2 rockes more, thwart of them lyeth a suncken rock, which you must avoyd.</P>
<P>From the Blocx alongst over the Bommel it is yet two leagues, first north, and then northnortheast, al alongst by the land of Bommelhead, the south end of this land is a high steepe poynt, called Bommel-head to the south∣wards of it runneth a channell westsouthwest into the sea called Bommell-sound.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bommell-sound.</NOTE> This channel is easy to bee known, comming in out of the sea. The land of Bommel-head is about 4 leagues long, and the first long Island to the northwardes of Schuytenesse, it is altogether low plaine land except on the south end, which is so steep a poynt, as if it were hewen right off with an Axe. About the middest between both ends of this Island (on the sea side) lyeth a very high round hill, called Sick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sick.</NOTE> of fashion almost like a sugerloafe or a mans hat, and lyeth farre above al that low land, which you may easily see at both the ends of this Island, and also further, where by it is very easy to be knowne.</P>
<P>For to sayle into this foresaid channell out of the sea, you must bring that steepe poynt of Bommell-head<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bommell-head.</NOTE> east northeast, or somewhat more northerly from you, and saile then towards it. And then you shall leave a great many little Islands and rockes on the starboard side, and the foresayd poynt on the larboard side, and close in about by it to the northwardes.</P>
<P>A little about this poynt of Bommel-head, on the In∣nerside lyeth a Haven, called Bommelhaven, there lyeth a rock before the mouth of it, and also a suncken rocke betwixt that rock and the north poynt of that Haven: He that will go in there, must go into the southwards of the rock, in betwixt the south poynt &amp; the foresaid rock, leaving the rock on the starboard side of him. So soone as men are within the Haven, they must let fall their anchor, within it is broade and wide, and men lye there landlockt for all winds.</P>
<P>At the end of the Bommell lyeth Munsterhaven<NOTE PLACE="marg">Munster∣haven.</NOTE> in the land of Bommell-head, on the west side of the Lieth, even about the poynt. This is also a good haven for them which are bound to the southwardes, and by reason of contrary winds cannot get further, there standeth a lit∣tle white church thwart of it men must anchor in ten or twelve fathom.</P>
<P>From Munsterhaven to Beulhave it is north an English mile, there is also good anchoring for southerly windes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beulsha∣ven.</NOTE> further it is north, somewhat easterly to Volger-roade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Volger-road.</NOTE> before it lyeth a little Island, under it, or by it on the one side or other men may anchor for all winds. Men may also sayle round about it, and run in and out at both sides of it, if they will.</P>
<P>From Munster-haven to Bremer-holme the Liet lyeth north, somewhat easterly about two leagues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bremer holm</NOTE> there the Liet is devided into 2 parts, to witt, into the Old and the New Liet: The old Liet goeth through to the east∣wards of Bremer-holme and the Island that lyeth to the northwards of it, but the new land alongst to the west∣wards of it.</P>
<P>The Olde Liet<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Liet.</NOTE> is not well to be used by them, which are not there very well acquainted, also great ships that draw twelve or thirteenfoot, may not goe through there.</P>
<P>Somewhat more then thwart of the middest of Bre∣mer-holme, in the narrow of the Old Liet, lyeth a shoale where upon is no more then thirteene or fourteene foote water. A little to the northwardes of it on the east shoare lyeth a bay called Ingesound, where is good anchoring: there lyeth also a bay on the west side, halfe wayes be∣twixt that foresayd shoale &amp; Bremerholm, where men also may anchor.</P>
<P>The New Liet<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Liet</NOTE> is broad &amp; deepe enough. Thwart of Bremer-holme, in the fareway, nearest the west side lyeth a sunken rock, where of you must take heed. For to avoyd it, you must marke the Island before Volger road. If you keep it so that you may see it without the north-poynt of Volgher-roade, then you cannot come too neare that suncken rock: but if you bring that Island behind the foresayd poynt, so that you cannot see it, you shall without fayle, sayle right upon it; you must observe these marks as well in sayling up as in say∣ling off.</P>
<P>In the middest of the New Lieth lyeth Ruighe-holme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruighe-holme.</NOTE> there men lye with shippes fast unto two Rings: the one is upon the Island, and the other upon the poynt to the northwards of it, where they bring out Cables to.</P>
<P>From the New Lieth to the poynt of Redholme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Redholm.</NOTE> it is northnortheast a halfe league, betwixt them both goeth out the Soltmerfioerd westsouthwest into sea, which is a fayre broad &amp; large channel. On the south side lye some suncken rockes, but if you runne out amidst the channell, you can take no hurt of them.</P>
<P>At sea men doe know this Soltmerfioerd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soltmer∣fioerd.</NOTE> by that foresayd high and round hill Siecke, which is very easy to be knowne, &amp; lyeth two leagues to the southwards of it, about halfe wayes betwixt this Sound &amp; Bommel-sound. The land on the south side of Soltmerfioerd to∣wards Sick, are small white rockes, which you must leave on the starboard side, and runne in so amidst the channel eastnortheast, and then you can take no hurt of those foresayd suncken rockes, lying on the south side of this channell. There lyeth also a suncken rocke at sea before this Sound on the south side a little off from the
<PB N="40" REF="69"/> north poynt of the land of Bommell-head, with hard winds out of the sea, the sea breaketh very much upon it, but it lyeth at least five or six fathom under water.</P>
<P>When as you come in there, you have Redholm on the larboard side, and you must run northeast alongst by it, until you come about the foresayd poynt.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Redholme to the Narrow it is north, &amp; through the Narrow northnorthwest &amp; north &amp; by west at least a halfe league.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reine Knaep.</NOTE>From the straite to the Reine Knape, the course is northwest, and by north two leagues: this is a little Island without trees, cleane round about, which you may sayle about on both sides.</P>
<P>Thwart of Reine Knaep on the east shoare lyeth Deepesound, a good haven for them which are bound to the southwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deepe sound.</NOTE> the mouth of it is narrow, and also but three fathom deepe, but within it is broad &amp; large, and twenty fathom deepe. Alongst to the westwards of the Reine Knaep, it is broadest, to the eastwards lyeth a point, &amp; by it a little Island you may sayle through betwixt the point &amp; the little Island. From the Reine Knaep to Bag∣holme, the course is north &amp; by east a great league: Betwixt them both lye some Islands and rocks, all which you must leave lying on the starboard side, there you may at divers places sayle through and within these Islands and rocks, and at last come out againe by Bag∣holme into the Liet, but it is not to be done but for them that are there extraordinary well acquainted. Men might lightly get in amongst these Islands and rockes, so that they should not know how to come out againe. At the east side of Bag-holm men may anchor, but there shooteth off a little ledge of rocks from the north end, whereof they must take good heed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crabkerk.</NOTE>From Bag-holme to Crab-kerke it is north about three quarters of a league, this is an indifferent haven for southerly winds, but it is little, there can lye no more then two or three shipps.</P>

<P>TO the northwards or northeastwardes from Geske lye (amongst a greate manie other rocks and little Islands) five greate Islands: the first called Luco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luco.</NOTE> which is a high Island, like as also the second, betwixt these two goeth in a channell about southeast called Luycksound.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luyck∣sound.</NOTE></P>
<P>Upon the third called Harnsoe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harnsoe.</NOTE> lyeth also a high hil, but it is at both endes somewhat lowe.</P>
<P>The fourth and smallest called Lemsoe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lemsoe.</NOTE> or the lowe Island sheweth it selfe in 2 or 3 lowe hommocks.</P>
<P>The fifth called Flemseu,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flemseu.</NOTE> or the Island, is a great and lowe Island, but seemeth little to see to at sea, because there lyeth but one hommock upon it (not verie greate) and of fashion as the roof or cabben of a Hoye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roofe Island.</NOTE> or the west end highest within the east poynt of that Island is a good roade in a bight, where men lie landlockt for all winds.</P>
<P>To the northwards or eastwards of Flemseu or Roofe Island, goeth in a channell called Nogwe Fioert, lying in east and by south, at which men may runne in to Roems∣dale.</P>
<P>Without these foresayd Islands off from Luco unto Boede, lyeth a great multitude of out rocks, great and small, called the Roemsdales Schares.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roemsda∣les Schares</NOTE></P>
<P>Eastwards from the Roofe Island, or Flemseu, lyeth (a∣mongst other rocks and little Islands) the Island Lever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lever.</NOTE> which men may sayle about on both sides, whether they be bound outwards from Roemsdale to Beresound or Boe, or inwards from Boe or Beresound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beresound</NOTE> and wil runne through the foresayd Islands.</P>
<P>Beresound is a Haven within some rockes even to the southwards or Westwards of the poynt Boe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boe.</NOTE> there it is good lying, but not good to come into without a Pilot, or some one that is there well acquainted.</P>
<P>Boede is an out-point, with a neck or small point of land, fast to the maine land, alongst to the southwards of it men may run in and up, to the southwards to Bere∣sound, or els goe to anchor in a bay on the north side behind Boe, by some houses, where they may lye shel∣tred for a west winde.</P>
<P>From Boe to Stemmeshest, the coast lyeth about n. e. and by n. 2 leagues, betwixt them both about half wayes lye many small lowe black Out-rocks, as if they were sowne alongst the shoar, called the Stoppels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stoppels.</NOTE> betwixt them and the maine land you cannot sayle through with great shipps without great danger. The Norwaye Barckes runne alongst with in them, and also anchor there within, under a rock, which is somewhat greater then the rest, and lyeth about the middst af the Stoppels (or somewhat nearer the main land) called the Eartholm.</P>
<P>All the Islands betwixt Broad-sound or Flowach and Boe, belong under Roemsdale.</P>
<P>From Stade to Stemmeshest (or Stemmesnes) the course is alongst without the Islands northeast and by n. about six &amp; twenty leagues, the land betwixt them both is cal∣led the Governement of Roemsdael.</P>
<P>Stemmeshest<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stemmes-Hest.</NOTE> is a high point easy to be known, it shew∣eth it self (when as you get sight of it, comming from the southwardes or the westwards) in two Hommocks thwart of it goeth in the Liet with divers entries.</P>
<P>About a shot of a cast-peece from the point lyeth a black round rock, altogether alone, not very great, called the black Oxe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Black Ox.</NOTE> Betwixt it &amp; the point goeth in an entrie, called after the foresaid rock, also the black Oxe, northeast and by east, it is not verie wide, and upon the shoalest 4 or 5 fathom deep at low water, the nearer to the Oxe the deeper, &amp; the nearer to the main land the shoaler water.</P>
<P>A little within the Rock, (the black Oxe) lyeth an other great rock or Island, pale of coulour, called White-holme, which you must leave (in sayling) also on the larboard side, you cannot sayle through betwixt it &amp; the black Oxe, be cause from the one to the other it is all full of rocks some above &amp; some under water.</P>
<P>A little within or to the end of Whiteholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitte∣holme.</NOTE> lyeth a sun∣ken rock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suncken Rock.</NOTE> which you must leave also on the larboard side.</P>
<P>In calm weather or smooth water you cannot well see it, but when it doth blowe any thing hard, you may well perceive it by the breaking of the sea upon it. On the star∣board side within Whiteholm, lyeth a great multitude of rocks, as if they where sowed along the shoare, amongst these rocks a little within or to the eastwards of the point of Stemneshest lyeth Smeerholme, an Island, where men may ride under, and lye sheltred for all winds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smeer∣helm.</NOTE> except with e. &amp; northeast windes, which blowe there in open, with those windes you cannot also come out there, neither with southsoutheast, south, southsouthwest, &amp; southwest winds, you cannot also come in there. You must sayle in there from the northwards, behind the Island. In the going in (which is not above a cables length broad, 8 or 10 fa∣thom deepe) lyeth a little round rock, at high water, about a fathom above water, by which you may runne about on both sides.</P>
<P>Northnorthwest about a halfe league from the black Oxe lyeth also a greater and broader, but a lower rock, called the Vogel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Voghel.</NOTE> which at high water lyeth a little abo∣ve water, but with a spring tide the sea runneth alongst over it. Betwixt it &amp; the black Oxe there seemeth to lye in a broade and wide channell, but betwixt them it is full of suncken rocks and soule grounds under water: When
<PB N="44" REF="75"/> it is smooth water, it is in no wise good to runne in there, but in foule weather and with a growne sea, and that you cannot doe otherwise, you might runne in there by the breaking of the sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mew-holme.</NOTE>A great half league northnorthwest from the Voghel lye yet some rocks, lying to the eastwardes, called the Mew-holmes, betwixt them and the foresayd Rock the Voghell goeth in a broade &amp; large channell, verie cleane without any dangers, which (after the Rock is also called the Vogell, there men may see all that can doe hurt. The marks for to finde this channell) comming out of the sea are two hills, verie easy to be knowne, which lye from thence east and east &amp; by north within the land. The westermost is a hill somewhat low and round of fashion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clapmuts &amp; Man∣gelbergh.</NOTE> allmost like a flat cap, called the Clapmuts. The eastermost is a high steepe sharpe Hill, above on the one side with a cutt, like as a steepe, called Manghelbergh. When these are one in the other, then they are about east &amp; by north from you, and then you are also right open before this channell.</P>
<P>For to saile in there, keepe these two foresaid hills one in the other, and sayle in right with them east, and east &amp; by north, or (when as you come within the Vogel) some∣what more easterly, so that you have the foresaid Hills out a head a little on the larboarde side, untill that you come by the main land, and then eastnortheast alongst by the shoare, (if you be bounde to Dronten) unto the Island Edou or Edoe.</P>
<P>About a league within the Vogel lye two rockes, the westermost is high and somewhat round, the other is low and also round, and lyeth to the eastwardes from the first, towards the land, you shall runne with the a fore∣sayd course of east &amp; e. &amp; by north off from the Vogel, about a shot of a cast-peece alongst to the southwardes of the 2 rockes. About half wayes betwixt them and the Vogell, (but nearest the 2 rocks) lye two suncken rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sun∣ken rocks.</NOTE> these you leave with the same course also on the larboard side, you may see the sea alwayes breake upon them, except in very smooth Water.</P>
<P>You may also sail through betwixt these two foresayd Rocks and the Mewholmes, to wit, alongst to the northwardes of the rocks, untill you come into the Liet, leaving these 2 rocks on the larboard side, and the Mew∣holms on the starboard side.</P>
<P>Alongst to the northwardes of the Mewholmes and those two foresaid rocks lyeth also a channell where men may sayle through into the Liet, then you must leave these 2 rockes to the southwardes on the starboard side, &amp; some other rocks to the northwards of them on the larboard side, and so come also into the Liet.</P>
<P>About three quarters of a league within these two foresayd Rocks, lyeth a great suncken rock, right in the middest of the farewaye, which breaketh allwayes, and at low water is uncovered, about which you may sayl on both sides. From this suncken rock to Swegge sound, the course is east, and east and by north a league, but the Voghel or black Oxe &amp; Sweggesound are distant about three leagues.</P>
<P>Sweggesound<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swegge∣sound.</NOTE> is a litle Haven behind three great rocks, with a little Island of an English mile long on the east side of it, when you sayle alongst by it, being but a little off from the shoare, you cannot discerne this Island from the maine land, but it seemeth to be all whole land, he that is not there verie well acquainted, cannot per∣ceive that to be an Island, before that he come close to it, for to runne in behind it. You may sayle into Swegge∣sound either to the eastwards of that Island, or to the westwards of it, according as the winde will serve. To the westwards of Sweggesound or the three foresayd rocks, at the west end of the end of the foresayde Island lye a great multitude of rocks &amp; foul grounds.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the western channel, you must leave them all on the starboard side, and runne in betwixt them and the three foresayd rockes: when you come to the and of these three Rocks, you must luffe up to the south∣wards about by them towards the northeast or north, &amp; anchor there in seven or eight fathom, there you shall lye landlockt for all winds, but with a storm out of the west the growne sea can come in rowling there through. You may also sayle in further behind the rocks, untill you come in behinde the foresayd Island, in a little narrow Bay, there men doe lye in 2 fathom and a halfe, or three fathom, and also sheltred for all windes. In this Haven of Sweggesound the ships commonly doe lye there to tarrie for the winde. He that is bound to the westwards, may runne out to the southwards of the three foresayd rocks, &amp; he that is bound to the eastwardes, may saile out to the northwardes, through betwixt the Land and the Island, but that channell is verie narrow &amp; not above 2 fathom deep.</P>
<P>A halfe league to the eastwards of Sweggesound lyeth the haven of Bremsnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bremsnes.</NOTE> a little quarter of a league within it on the starboard side standeth a little church, with some houses, which you shall espie behinde a point, when as you are come somewhat within, there dwelleth the Governour of Normer Leen. Men were wont to come to anchor there to paye custome, but now the Kings Customer dwelleth over against it in little Fossen, so that now at this present, men may eyther goe there, or to little Fossen for to paye their custome, according as occasion doth serve.</P>
<P>For to anchor before Bremsnes, you must looke out for two beackons, which stand by the church upon the water side, thwart of the innermost is the best Roade, &amp; also the best grounde, let your anchor fall there, in twenty, fifteen, eight or tenne fathom, that is neare by the shoare, for there it is verie steep rising ground, and make you fast with a hawser to the beakons, there you shall lie landlockt for all winds, you may not anchor any where thereabouts, then in the foresayd place, by reason of the great depth, &amp; verie steepe grounds.</P>
<P>Little Fossen or Fossound is a narrowe haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Fos∣sound.</NOTE> lying to the northwardes, over against Bremsnes, betwixt two lands. In these two places lye the ships commonly to tarrie for the winde, they that are bound to the east∣wards before Bremsnes, &amp; they that are bound to the westwardes in Little Fossen. Men may also sayle from Fossen to the eastwardes, through betwixt the foresayde land, &amp; come into Stanwixfioerd againe in roome into the Lieth of Dronten, but it is a verie narrow channell, and not wel to be done for them which are not there verie wel acquainted.</P>
<P>Westnorthwest, from the haven of Bremsnes goeth a channell through the rockes called Flessound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flessound</NOTE> after three round Rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Flessen.</NOTE> called three Flesse which lye in a rowe without the east side of this channell, and thereby is very easy to be knowne. A little within the three Flesses, lyeth a great black flat rock, when you are by or in the Havens-mouth of Bremsnes, it lyeth westnorth∣west, or somewhat more northerly from you. For to run out from thence at that channell, sail right with the aforesaid black rocks, and runne to the southwards of it close alongst by it, leaving it and the Flesses on the star∣board side, (to the norhwards of this flat rock &amp; the Flesse it is all ful of rocks, some above and some under water) you shall then leave on the larboard side of you two other round rocks, which you shall see lye about a shot of a cast peece eastnortheast, or northe. &amp; by east one from the other. When you are come without the Flesses, you shall be without all the rocks, but somewhat to the westwards of them lyeth a great row of rocks, lying westnorthwest a good wayes into sea, you may runne westnorthwest alongst by them unto the end: when you are come without the Flesses you may set your cours somwhat more northerly, for to get sea room betimes. In this foresayd channell there is no danger, that can hurt you, but you may see it. In the offing you may know this foresayd channell, by the foresaid three Flesses.</P>
<P>The markes for to finde Flessound, comming in out of
<PB N="45" REF="75"/> the sea, are two high Hils, the one called Freekol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freekol.</NOTE> lying upon an Island, towardes the southeast, not farre from Bremsnes, the other called Northhorne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">North∣horne.</NOTE> lying farr with∣in the land. Freekol is a hill with two hommocks where of the southermost is the smallest &amp; lowest. Northhorne is a hill much higher, with a sharp toppe, &amp; lye alwayes white, covered with snowe. When this hill &amp; the foresayd southermost Hommock of Freekol stand one in the other (then they are southeast &amp; by south from you) and if that you saile in right with then, you shall without fail fall right open before Flessound. It is a channel of a shoare inlet, and very commodious, as also Gryp∣sound for them which comming from Dronten, Edou, or any other place in the Lieth, and before night cannot saile to the channels of the black Oxe or Voghel, for to runne through them into sea.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a league to the eastwardes of Brems∣nes lyeth Stangwyxfioird, a large broad sound, at the east poynt lyeth a great many rocks, within lyeth a Haven, called Hamersound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hammer∣sound.</NOTE> you may not come in there but with a Pilot except you be there extraordinary well acquainted.</P>
<P>A quarter of a league within that foresayd point, on the north side of Stangwyxfioird, lye two lade-places, Iorian∣wach &amp; Lynwach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iorian∣wach. Lynwach.</NOTE> men runne in there to the north∣wardes, behinde some rocks, but it is also Pilots water.</P>
<P>Towards the southeast from Iorianwach, men may sayle farre within the land, into divers sounds, Stang∣wyxfioird, Schaelwicxfioird, Northfioird, Walsfioird, Wenningfioird, and other more. Upon the land of Iorian∣wach lyeth the mountaine of Toester, in 2 hilles, to the eastwardes of it upon the next land lyeth the mountaine of Stadebuye, also in 2 hills, as Toester. These hills of Toester and Stadebuy, when you come from the west∣wardes alongst the Lieth, lye right behinde one the other, and seeme then to be no more then one hill, but being thwart of them in the Liet, or at sea, each sheweth in 2, which is together foure very high hills, and are commonly called together without difference Toester Poester.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toester Poester.</NOTE></P>
<P>Betwixt Toester &amp; Stadebuye runneth through a nar∣row Sound, into the Northfioird, called Soolsound.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soolsound</NOTE> To the east of Stadebuye runneth also another sound through into the Northfioird, called Emmersound, within which on the north side, close by the Northfioird is a lade place, where men do lade good deales.</P>
<P>A quarter of a league in the Liet, to the eastwards of Emmersound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Emmer∣sound.</NOTE> runneth in another sound, at the entrie broade and wide within it divideth it selve into 2 p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts. Sayling in there you must leave Fisholme and the Yel∣lowe Island on the larboard side, &amp; a rockie Island, called the flat Island, with manie Rocks on the starboard side. The Yellow Island<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Yel∣low Island</NOTE> is not wel to be discerned from the main land, for those which are not there well acquainted, the end of the Northfioird runneth there about behinde it, &amp; maketh it an Island the Norwaybarkes runne much thereabout behind it. To the southwardes of the flatte Island lyeth a Rock or little Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flatholm.</NOTE> called Flathome, be∣twixt them both is good anchoring in 10 or 12 fathom, landlockt for all winds.</P>
<P>Through this Sounde men doe runne into Eursound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eursound.</NOTE> a lade place lying in the Northfioird, there standeth a little church on the west side of the flatte Island. Betwixt the little Island is also a good haven, where men may lye in three, foure and five fathom, it is not broade but cleane. To the eastwards of this Yellow Island lyeth the high land of Dromsnes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dromsnes</NOTE> From thence eastwardes, further up into the Liet, towardes Dronten or Agenes, it is most all whole land, and not so broken, as to the westwards of it.</P>
<P>Thwart of the rocks of Hammer-sound (lying on the east side of Stangwyxfioird) lyeth a faire channell called Gryp-sound, one of the best channells for to come in out of the sea into the Liet, it is about a quarter of a league broade, and goeth in close to the eastwardes of the Island Grype.</P>
<P>Grype<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gryp.</NOTE> is a little rounde Island lying from the Voghell northeast and by east distant about five leagues, upon it dwell manie Fishernen, which goe from thence to sea, to fish upon divers bancks, of fortie, fiftie, seventie, eightie, and hundred fathom, foure, five, sixe, seven, eight and some tenne leagues without the land, which they knowe to finde by markes on the shoare. On the north side of Grype there lye but two or three rocks close to the shoare, some saye that thereabout is anchor ground in twelve fathom. On the south or west side, it is full of Rocks, but they lye most above water. About halfe wayes betwixt Grype and the three Flesses, some∣what without all the other Rocks, lyeth a suncken rock a little under water, he that runneth alongst without these rocks, must be mindfull thereof.</P>
<P>For to goe into Grypesound comming in out of the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gryp∣sound.</NOTE> you must bring the high Mountain of Toester Poe∣ster eastsoutheast from you, and sayle in right with it, and so you shall not sayle to runne in sight of the Island Gryp, which is easy to knowe from the other rocks, by the great manie Fishermens houses, which stand upon it, and upon no other Island nor Rocks thereabouts, leave that Island on the starboard side, and goe in first east∣southeast right with Toester, being past the Island Gryp, bring Toester two poynts on your larboard bowe, and goe so in southeast, you shall come into the Liet betwixt Hammersound and Toester. From thence to the little Island Edou<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edou.</NOTE> are about four leagues. About three leagues to the westwardes of it, or a league to the eastwards of Grypsound in the Lieth, lyeth also a suncken rock, almost even with the water, and almost amidst the farewaye, nearest the north side, you may alwayes see the sea breake upon it, leave it on the larboard side, and runne to the southwards of it, there it is broadest, you may for a neede run also to the northwards of it through be∣twixt it &amp; the other rocks, but it is there narrow.</P>
<P>Edou<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edou.</NOTE> or Edoe is a somewhat low plain Island, a league long, &amp; very narrow, which is the first land out on the lar∣board side, upon the Liet, that men have shelter of from the sea, to the westwards of it, there is nothing but bro∣ken land, Rocks and little Islands, where the growne sea commeth rowling in through. Not farre from the west end, upon the south side of Edou, standeth a little white Church, thwart of it, or a little to the eastwards of it, men may anchor in eight, nine, and tenne fathom. The shoare is steep rising ground: If men doe come neare it in foure fathom, they shall be presently fast, but the grounde is soft. When as men come from the westwards, and will anchor there, they must (comming neare the west end of the Island) continually feele with the leade for the anchor ground, and so soone as they feele it, let fall their anchor, thwart of the aforesayd little white Church, or a little to the eastwardes of it, so that the little Church come to stand over the houses. When as they let fall their anchor in 10 fathom, and wending up towards the land, verie out the cable then the shippe shall come to lye there in sixe fathome, the Liet is there∣abouts aboute a halfe league broade.</P>
<P>Upon the east end of Edou is also a little haven called Kurow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kurou.</NOTE> and it is so little that there can lye no more then two or three ships, there lyeth a little black rock not farre from the shoare, men doe runne in betwixt that little rock and the Island, &amp; anchor betwixt them both, there men lye landlockt for all winds, but the ground there is not cleane.</P>
<P>At the east end of Edou lyeth another Island somewhat long, called Glaseu.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glaseu.</NOTE> To the eastwards of it runneth a great broade Sound into sea, called Ramsfioird, but it is known of few.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rams∣fioerd.</NOTE> With northerly winds there commeth through a great growne sea into the Lieth.</P>
<P>To the eastwards from Ramsfioerde lieth the land of Hitteren, two greate long Islands. Norther Hitteren,<NOTE PLACE="marg">High∣land of Hitteren.</NOTE> &amp; Souther Hitteren, together about seven leagues long, so that he that sayleth up the Lieth thwart of them, can not perceive otherwise, but that he sayleth in betwixt
<PB N="46" REF="76"/> two maine lands. At the south end or west end of Hitte∣ren, which is on the cast side of Ramsfioerd ly two little Islands, called Weroy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weroy.</NOTE> there you may sayle in betwixt them, &amp; anchor in good white sand ground, you may also saile through betwixt the little Islands, alongst into the Liet, &amp; then you leave a suncken rock lying on the starboard side by the southermost little Island.</P>
<P>From the Island Edou to the Highland, or the pointe of Dromsnes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dromsnes</NOTE> it is northeast and by east and eastnortheast distant about three leagues. To the westwards of that poynt, to witt, betwixt that poynt &amp; the land to the westwardes of it called Schipnes, lyeth a haven called Schaerswycke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schaers∣wyke.</NOTE> In the mouth of this haven, about the middest of the channell, but somewhat nearer Schipnes then Dromsnes, lyeth a suncken rock, which falleth drie at low water, you may runne in about it on both sides. A little within the poynt, on the south side standeth a Countriemans house, before which you may anchor in five, sixe or seven fathom, cleane rising ground, which you may come neare by your leade. This haven lyeth about a league more to the eastwards, then Ramsfioird, on the south side of the Liet, fitt for to come to anchor in, for those which can sayl no further by day. To the westwards of this foresaid haven Schaerswycke alongst the land of Schipnes, lye manie Rocks by the shoare, some above &amp; some under water, therefore you must somewhat shunne the southshoare thereabouts, but the north shoare alongst by Hitteren is verie cleane. The Liet is thereabouts a great halfe league broade.</P>
<P>Aboute five leagues to the eastwards of Schaerswyke, on the north side of the Lieth, lye the two Islands of Lexen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lexen.</NOTE> to witt, norther and souther Lexen, which are together about a halfe league long. There the Liet lyeth betwixt both eastnortheast, and northeast and by east.</P>
<P>In souther Lexen is a baye, before which lyeth a round rock, making it there within a faire haven, called the haven of Lexen the best haven of al the Liet. Iohn Geurtson Boogart of Amsterdam, hath (at this owne charges, for the commoditie of ships that come there) caused to be made a great Iron ring: men doe anchor either to the eastwardes or to the westwardes of the foresaid rock, where they will in sixe, seven or eight fathom, and bring a hawser on the foresayd Ring, the further men doe runne into the Bight, betwixt the Rocke and the land, the shoaler it is but all clean and clear ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der north Lexen.</NOTE>At the norther end of norther Lexen is also a place, where is good anchor ground fitt for to make road in.</P>
<P>Over against the haven of Lexen lyeth another haven called Moltow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moltow.</NOTE> where the ships doe oftentimes anchor in the Harvest or beginning of the winter, for to set sayle with an east winde, because they can hardly get to sayle from Lexen with easterly winds.</P>
<P>A league to the southwards or to the westwards of these havens of Lexen and Moltow, on the south shoare, lyeth a little Island, whereupon standeth a Warder, called Swanholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swan∣holm.</NOTE> which men may sayle round about; under that little Island it is good anchoring (as wel for them which are bound to the eastwards as to the west∣wards) in 4 or 5 fathom good clean sand ground.</P>
<P>The south side of the Liet off from Schaerswyke alongst to Hegwyke, (which is a league and a half, &amp; two leagues by west the poynt of Agenes) is most cleane with little fowle grounds: but from Hegwyke alongst to Agenes the coast is fowle and rocky. The north side alongst by Hitteren, is also indifferent cleane, except at the north end lye some rocks called the Terlingen, which lye somewhat off to the southwards from the shoare into the Liet. A little to the eastwards of Hem∣nesioird,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemne∣fioird.</NOTE> over against Hemneschell (an Orchard upon a high land) there the Liet is at the narrowest, &amp; no more then a halfe quarter of a league broad.</P>
<P>Hemnesfioird lyeth over against the north end of Hitteren, it is a bay where many Sawes doe stand, &amp; abundance of good Deales are cut &amp; laden.</P>
<P>To the northwards or eastwardes of the Terlingen, at the north end of Hitteren, in betwixt Hitteren and Lexen, lyeth a haven called Deepsound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deep∣sound.</NOTE> the Norway Barks (comming from the southwards) run in there along behind Lexen to the northwards.</P>
<P>From Lexen to the poynt of Agenes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agenes.</NOTE> on the south side, or to Euriland on the north side, the Lieth lyeth alongst eastnortheast and northeast &amp; by east 3 leag. Agenes is the northermost point of the Lieth, you must go about by it when you are bound to Dronten.</P>
<P>Betwixt Norther Lexen &amp; Euriland lye two Islands, the southermost is called Fossen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fossen.</NOTE> the northermost Garten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garten.</NOTE> to the southward of Fossen you may sail through alongst into the sea, but not without a Pilot.</P>
<P>For to sayle from Lexen to Agenes, run alongst by the north shoare, which is the cleanest, the south shoare is fowle. A cables length or a cables length and a halfe to the westwards of the poynt Agenes, lyeth a suncken rock not farre from the shoare. For to avoid it &amp; more other danger, keepe alongst by the north shoare (but take heed that you run not in to no bights or bayes) so long untill that you can see the houses upon Agenes, then sayl towards it, &amp; then you shall not sayle within any dangers on the south shoare. On the point of Agenes is also a great Iron Ring for to moore the shipps to there by it is deeper and steepe off-going sowle ground. For to anchor there you must bee very close by the shoare before you shall finde ground, &amp; then you must make a cable fast on the foresayd Ring, close to the shoare it is about five of sixe fathom deep fowle ground.</P>
<P>On the north side of the Liet over against the poynt of Agenes, lyeth Euriland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euriland.</NOTE> a flat fayre greene land, upon it standeth a little white Church about an English mile off from the shoare within the land, almost like the little Church of Edou, thwart of it is a good road cleane flat rising sand, &amp; clay ground, men doe commonly anchor there thwart of the first beakon in seven, eight or nine fathom good clay ground, 16, 17 or 18 fathom men lye farre from the shoare.</P>
<P>With contrary windes, or that men can not come about Agenes, or taken with the night, they doe anchor most commonly there.</P>
<P>By Agenes there runneth out alwayes a great strong current to the westwardes, &amp; by reason the lands from thence to the southwardes on both sides are very high, and the winde (being southerly) falleth there betwixt then both, alwayes strong to the northwards, men can not (in sayling up) get any thing there with turning to windewards, but in sailing off they may get much by the current with turning to windewards.</P>
<P>A little about the point of Agenes on the starboard side, is a great Bay called Salva,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salva.</NOTE> wherein is good anchor ground, &amp; good lying, but with northerly winds it is verie hard to come out there for those that are bound out, or to the westwards.</P>
<P>From Agenes to the poynt of Rooberg, the Liet lyeth southsoutheast about three leagues. About halfe wayes or somewhat more on the west side lies another bay, called Lenswycke, where men may have roade.</P>
<P>Roobergh<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roobergh.</NOTE> is a somewhat flat poynt, to the eastwards or to the northwards about this poynt is good road in sixe or seven fathom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade.</NOTE> A good wayes from the shoare to the westwards of the poynt, the Norway Barks doe oftentimes anchor, but the ground there is not cleane, and therefore it is no good road for great ships.</P>
<P>Over against Roobergh lye divers Bayes and havens, as Urkedal, Bursen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bursen.</NOTE> Bodwyke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodwyke</NOTE> and other more, where many Deales are cut and laden.</P>
<P>From Roobergh to the little Island or Holm of Dron∣ten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holm of Dronten.</NOTE> the course is east 3 leagues, when you are a little past Rooberghen, you shall soone espy it against the high land to the eastwards of Dronten, betwixt them both it is wide and broad. From the poynt of Roobergh the land lyeth up to the northwards so far that at some places men can hardly see over the water. When you come by the Holm, you may saile about within it on both sides, you must bring the Holm to the northwards

<HEAD>The tenth Demonstration, In which The east side of England, is shewed, from the River of London to Welles.</HEAD>
<P>BY two wayes men may saile into the river of London, from the southwards alongst by the north Forland, and from the northwards alongst by the Naes. If you will sayle in there from the southwards, then you must first shun the North Forland, it is there shoale a good wayes from the shoare, bring the north Forland also not more southerly from you then southwest, that you do not run on against the north-grounds,
<PB N="48" REF="79"/> which lye farre to seawards. Comming by the land, run alongst by it, but come not too neere it, that you loose sight of the spyre of the steeple of Margat behind the land, for then you should come too neere it; but if you keepe so far from the shoare, that you can see the foresayd steeple above the high land, or keep it even in your sight, then you cannot take hurt of the south grounds. Comming thwart of Margat, then you are past the foresaid shoals or south grounds. Run then bold∣ly towards the shoare, and within two cables lengths alongst by it, for to avoid the north grounds, which lye farre to the southwards towards the land. Sayle on so west all alongst by the shoare, untill that the Reculvers (which are two steeples upon one Church) come one in the other, and then you shall run in sight of the first buye upon the Lasts, which lieth upon the foresaid markes of the Reculvers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reculvers</NOTE> being by it you can also see the other buy which lyeth like as the first also on the north side, and over against it on the south side standeth a beakon, there you must saile through betwixt them both, leaving the buye on the starboard side, and the beakon over against it on the larboard side. From thence you may with little shippes, or shippes of little draught, but not with ships of great draught, at high water run over the Swallow on westnorthwest towards Sheppy, for it is there shoale water, with ships of great draught you must runne through the Fishers deep towards Black-tayle. You may also runne from Margat with small shippes alongst by the shoare upon the lead at high water even unto the Sheppy, but in sayling, alongst there you must cast your tides well, for the flood falleth very strong into the Swallow, and the ebbe to the con∣trary very strong out.</P>
<P>When you come by Sheppy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheppy.</NOTE> runne within two cables lengths alongst by it, for to avoid the taile of the Span∣jard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spag∣niard.</NOTE> untill that you be past Quinsbrough, edge then off from the south shoare for to avoyd the Noere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nore</NOTE> which is a sande that shooteth off from the south poynt of the River a good wayes to the eastwards, upon the outer∣most end where of standeth allwayes a beakon, whereby you may know it. Run alongst to the northwards of it, leaving it on the larboard side, and alongst in the middle of the channell into the sea-reach for to avoid the grounds which lye off from the north shoare, goe in so alongst towardes Gravesend.</P>
<P>To sayle with shippes of great draughts alongst by the north Forland up into the Thames, you must (when you are past the buyes upon the Last) sayle through the Fishers deep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishers-deep.</NOTE> toward Black-tayle, which lyeth from the second buye upon the Lasts, unto the first buye in the Fishers deep, northwest and northwest and by west, which lyeth upon the north side of the sand, which men doe call the Spanjard, those two buyes lye a great wayes one from the other.</P>
<P>Sayling from the buye upon the Lasts it is a great wayes all shoale water, so that you must runne over there with high water, but comming neare the buye upon the Spanjard, it is by little and little deeper water. He that will saile over here, must reckon his tydes well, the flood falleth there alongst towards the southwest almost thwart over the deepe and the ebbe to the con∣trary.</P>
<P>The second buye in the Fishers Deepe you must leave on the starboard side, &amp; the buye upon the Spanjaerd on the larboard side: being past that you come against the Blacketayle, to the southwards of the Shoebeakon into the right deepe. The cast poynt of Sheppy shall then lye about south from you. From the Shoe-beakon the course is southwest to the point of Blacktaile there runneth off a hooke which men might (at unawares) sayl within (comming from the northwards) in five or sixe fathom, but if you keep from the shoar in seven fathom, you cannot sayle within it. From Black-taile to the beakon upon the Noere, the course is westsouthwest, leave it on the larboard side, as before is said, and runne in alongst the river, in the middst of the channell betwixt both lands unto Gravesend.</P>
<P>For to saile into the river of London comming from the northwards<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to saile into the river off London from the north∣wards.</NOTE> you must come neere the coast to the northwards of Orfordnes which is to the northwards of all the sands, there lye Albrough, Dunwich, Walder∣swike, Sowle and Covehit, all betwixt Orfordnes and Leystaf. Covehit is a sharp steeple like as also Leystraffe, but Sowle and Walderswyke, Albrough and Orfordnes are flat steeples Sowle<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sowle.</NOTE> and Dunwich<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunwich.</NOTE> lye both upon the high land, betwixt them both is a valley, therein you may see Walderswike when you are thwart of it Dun∣wich is the best to be knowne of all these foresayd places: it hath two flat steeples, and on both sides some trees. To the southwards of it lyeth Albrough<NOTE PLACE="marg">Albrough</NOTE> which is also very easy to be knowne, it hath one high flat steeple with three mills, the two stand to the northwards, and the third to the southwards of Albrough when you are thwart of it, but sailing to the southwards, they come at last all three to the southwards of it. The land without Albrough, and to the southwards of it is very low flat and chindely land.</P>
<P>Betwixt Albrough and Dunwich about half wayes betwixt them, lyeth a Wood which is at both ends high, and in the middest low with a saddle; this you shall commonly see first when you fall with the land there∣abouts, and is the best to be knowne for to know the coast by; the land without it, and to the southwards is very low flat chindely land. About two leagues to the southwards of Albrough lyeth Orfordnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orford∣nes.</NOTE> betwixt them both stand also two woods of trees, which shew themsel∣ves a farre off like castles or towers. Orfordnes is a flat steeple with a thick or broad castle, which hath also athick flat steeple, almost of fashion like the steeple of Rarop, open above with holes in it like Bellholes.</P>
<P>Before Dunwich you may anchor, there is good lying in eight or nine fathom, somewhat soft ground. Before Albrough is the best road of all the coast there∣abouts in six and seven fathom.</P>
<P>East from Aelbrough about two league lieth Ael∣brough Knock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aelbroug Knock.</NOTE> this is a sand which at low water is not deeper then seven or eight foote: you may sound round about it in five fathom, but is not good to come nearer it. With sea winds you may descerne it plainly by the breaking of the sea upon it; but with lawderly or wester∣ly winds, &amp; faire weather, the sea breaketh not upon it, hee that runneth thereby to the northwards with an ebb shall see it commonly ripple very much upon it, like as upon most of the English bancks, &amp; not indeed upon the bankes, but against them, for upon the shoalest or mid∣dest of the bankes is alwayes the smoothest water, like as you finde every where.</P>
<P>When as Aelbrough is west from you, and the two steeples of Orfordnes are one in the other, there you shall finde Albrough Knock. These are sure marks of that sand.</P>
<P>The Whiting, or Whiting sand, is somewhat a long small sand lying before Orfordnes, and the chindely land to the southwards of Aelbrough, and lyeth alongst the reach, but the south end lyeth further from land then the north end, there is at low water not above six or seven foot water upon it. Comming from the north∣wards, men sayle commonly to the westwards of it, that is through betwixt the land and Whiting-sand, towards the Naze. Men may also saile alongst to the eastwards of it, through betwixt Whiting-sand<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whiting-sand.</NOTE> and the eastermost poynt of the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court</NOTE> or Court-sand, which some doe call the Rib.</P>
<P>The north end of the Whiting lyeth alongst close to the shoare, and lyeth from the steeples of Orfordnes southeast and by south, it is so exceeding steepe and needle too, that you shall have the one cast nine, the next cast five fathom, and then you are no more but a ships length from it, before you can heave the lead again
<PB N="49" REF="79"/> you should be upon it. When as you sit with the foreship against it, it is at the stearne five or six fathom deep.</P>
<P>Alongst the inner-side, it is also everie where so steepe, that you cannot sounde it, but on the outer side you may runne alongst by it in five fathom upon the lead, untill you come within the sands.</P>
<P>When as you come from the northwardes and wil sayle through within the Whiting, you must run close alongst by the shoare, &amp; southwest about by the poynt of the chindle to the southwardes of Aelbrough; untill you come within the north poynt of the Whitinge, when the steeples of Orfordnes come to be northwest and by north from you, then you are right thwart of the north poynt of the Whiting, being within it goe againe more southerly, to wit, southwest and by south towardes Balsy cliffe.</P>
<P>If you should fall to the southwards of Whiting, or els comming from the southwards will sayle in there to the northwardes, then bring the steeples of Orfordnes westnorthwest or northwest and by west, but for all not more northerly then northwest from you, and sayle so right in untill you come by the Chindle strand, then run in alongst by it, as is before saide, and then you shall run far enough alongst to the northwardes of the Whiting.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to runne into the east∣wards off the Why∣ting.</NOTE>If you will sayle into the eastwardes or the southwardes of the Whiting, then bring the steeples of Orfordnes northnorthwest, or northwest and by north, or northwest from you, and sayle in so right with them; untill that the wood of trees, that standeth upon the next poynt to the southwardes of Balsy cliffe, come to Balsy cliffe, which shall then stand about westsouthwest from you, keepe that aforesayd woode to the south side of the cliffe, and saile in bouldly right with it, and then you shall runne right in the farewaye, in betwixt the Whiting, and the tayle of Courtesand but if you bring the foresaide trees more then a handspikes length without the cliffe, you shall not fayle to runne on against the point of the Courte. That aforesayd wood of trees is verie easy to be knowne, because there abouts stand no other trees.</P>
<P>Or bring the steeple of Balsy westsouthwest from you, and saile in so right with it, untill you come by Whi∣ting-sand, in five or sixe fathom: and leade it in so by, it upon the leade, untill that you come by Balsy, or that you gett deeper water.</P>
<P>When you come neare Balsy, whether you be come in from the northwards, or the southwardes of Whiting∣sand, you must keepe somewhat off from the shoare, because of a litttle riffe or smalltayle, that shooteth off from the shoare, thwart of Balsy cliff, which you must avoyde somewhat, with shippes of greate draughts, there remaineth at low water upon it not more then two fathom, you may commonly perceive it well by the rippeling of the tyde.</P>

<P>Two leagues to the northwardes of Covehit lyeth Leystaf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leystaf.</NOTE> &amp; two leagues more to the northwardes of it lyeth Yarmouth. The steeple of Leystaff is a high sharp steeple, &amp; standeth a greate musketh shot within the land from the houses, so that in sayling alongst you may bring the steeple on both sides of the houses. Off from Leystaff begin the banck or Holmes of Yarmouth &amp; lye alongst to the northwards past Yarmouth, untill thwart of Winterton, there go divers channels through them, which men may sayl through, upon divers marks, for these that are there acquainted, you may sayle through within these bancks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to come with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the bancks of Yarmouth</NOTE> off from Leystaff untill past Winterton.</P>

Bring these foresayd firebeakons northwest &amp; by north, or somewhat more northerly from you &amp; sayle in so right with them either by night or by daye, the church of Leystaf commeth then to the southwards of the Town over a Countrie house by the water side, when you come against the channell, there is at low water no more then 3 fathom depth, keep these foresayd firebeakons one in the other, or bring the Innermost rather a little to the northwards of the outermost, for to avoyd a little plate, which lyeth on the south-side of the Deep, but the chan∣nell is indifferent wide, run untill you come against the strand in two fathom and a half or two fathom, so neare as you will or can, &amp; go then up northwardes alongst by the shoare, you shal then (having sayled a little to the northwards) meet with a flat, whereupon remaineth at low water lesse then two fathom depth, with laden ships, you must anchor before that flat and stay for high water, it floweth there aboute eight foot, up &amp; downe, so soone as you are over the flat it will be 5, 6, &amp; 7 fathom deep, edge then to the shoare, &amp; sail toward it, and then you come before the Brewehouse, there is the roade, where you may anchor in 4, 5, or 6 fathom, from thence northward toward Yarmouth alongst the shoare is all over good anchoring and good ground.</P>
<P>About an English mile or somewhat more to the southwards of the towne Yarmouth, is the haven of Yar∣mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haven of Yarmouth</NOTE> it hath two wooden heads, where you must sayle in betwixt them both against the highest water, when the strongest of the floud is spent, at halfe floud it is dan∣gerous, because of the strong tide, which should lightly carrie you into the bight, against the shoare, (against your will) it is also best to run in alongst by the souther∣head, there it is deepest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rode be∣fore Yar∣mouth.</NOTE> At Yarmouth in the roade men doe commonly anchor to the northwards of the haven, right thwart of the towne, in 5, sixe, seven, or eight fa∣thom the nearer you anchor to the sandes the deeper water you shall have, but all good sand &amp; soft grounds.</P>
<P>If you will sayle into the Roade of Yarmouth through the Holmes, then bring the sharpe little steeple, that stan∣deth to the northwards of Yarmouth within the land, over the broade castle, or bring the mill to the north side of the towne: keep these marks so standing, and goe in so westnorthwest, you shall find in this channell not lesse water then eight or nine fathom at half floud, this chan∣nell is called S.

<P>Thwart of Winterton runneth off a dangerous rif, which is dangerous to sayle about by night, if men doe come too near it, which is upon the end so steep, that (in 3 fathom or 2 fathom &amp; a half) you shal not be a ships length off from it. But when as you (comming from the southwards) keep your self in six or seven fathom, then you cannot sayl so neare to it. To the southwards of that rif upon the land, standeth a firetowre, which is verie easy to be knowne, with a firebeakon, &amp; also a little white house, when these come one in the other, then you are thwart of the poynt of the riff.</P>
<P>To the northwards of this riff upon the land stand two white firebeakons, whereupon there is fired by night, for to avoyd this riff. When as you come thwart of the poynt, then are these also one in the other, so that these doe serve for thwart marks, and the other to the south∣wards of them for longst marks, for those that will sayle about it from the southwards. Comming from the north∣wards alongst the shoare in 5 or 6 fathom, untill you come by the firebeakons upon the north side, you must keep somewhat off from the shoare, before they come one in the other, or els you should run on against the rif. When they are one in the other then they stand s. w. &amp; by w. from you, and when as the high firebeakon to the southwards of Winterton cometh to be s. west, somewhat more westerly from you, then you are thwart of the point of the rif: you may not also run about far within that riff, for then you should lightly bee foule of the grounds on the eastwards of it, especially when you come from the northwards for there it is not verie wide betwixt them both.</P>
<P>From Winterton to Haesbrough poynt, the course lyeth northwest 3 leagues.</P>
<P>Betwixt Haesbrough &amp; the Admiralshouse stands a ruinous tower upon the strand.

Foure leagues without the land lyeth Winterton sand, the south end where of lyeth about east &amp; the north end northeast from Winterton.</P>
<P>Thwart of Admiralshouse, not far from the shoare, lyeth also a little plate where no ship can go over, but if you goe in six or seven fathom, you cannot sayle too neare it, you may also runne through in 2 fathom, betwixt this plate &amp; the land.</P>

Thwart of that foresayd Saltfleet haven, about an English mile from the shoare lyeth a banck or Sandplate, not verie great, which at low water falleth almost drye, you must runne about without it, &amp; leave it lying towards the land from you, but yet for need you may also sayl through within it.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the Humber<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into the Humber.</NOTE> comming from the northwards, you must sayle alongst by the shoare, and runne about by the n. poynt, but comming by the poynt you must keepe somewhat off from the shoare in 4 or 5 fathom, for to avoyd a little taile, which lyeth off from the poynt, being about it, runne to the little Island, which lyeth a little by west that foresayd north poynt.</P>
<P>If comming from the southwards you desire to sayle to the Humber, then bring the Pawle Steeple (which is a high sharpe steeple standing on the North side of the Humber) a little by south the North poynt of the Hum∣ber, or over that foresayd little Island, and sayle so right in with it, untill that you come by that little Island, be∣ing come by it, leave it on the starboard side and run in close by it, for to avoyd a great Sand called the Bul, which lyeth off from the South shoare almost unto that little Island. When that you come within that little Island, then bring the two beakons (which stand upon that little Island) one in the other, keepe them so stan∣ding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road be∣fore Grims¦by.</NOTE> &amp; sayle so on to the westwards towards Grimsby, you leave the Buye upon the Bull lying then on the lar∣board side, &amp; run along to the northwards of it: In this faireway it is seven and eight fathom deepe. You may not come neerer the Bull then in sixe fathome. Before Grimsby you may anchor in three or foure fathome at lowe water, it floweth there at least three fathom up &amp; down, a westsouthwest &amp; eastnortheast Moone maketh before the Humber the highest water. Within the fore∣sayd Island at the north poynt of the Humber, you may anchor in three or foure fathom: There lye commonly Ships that are bound out, and tarrie for the Wind.</P>
<P>From Grimsby in alongst to Hull, the course is west northwest to the end of the Banck or ballast Plate, which you must leave lying on the north side. On the south side lyeth also a little plate, there standeth commonly a Beakon upon it, that you must leave on the Larboard side, &amp; run along to the Northwards of it, being past it, you may run alongst by the South shoare in 3 fathom. The fareway there is foure, five, and sixe, and thwart of the foresayd Beakon eight and tenne fathom. When you come to the end of the Banke, you must edge up to the Westwards about by the poynt on the South side, but there runneth off a Flat which you must avoid. Being a little about that poynt you shall see the Towne of Hull, lye before you, there you may anchor before it in sixe, seven, or eight fathom: An east and west Moon maketh full sea before Hull. He that will anchor upon the ballast plate, let him bring the flat steeple which standeth a little to the northwards or the eastwards of Hull to the high point of Pawl, and keepe them so stan∣ding untill that he come to the plate, there it is best for to anchor upon it.</P>
<P>From the North poynt of the Humber called Spurne head to Flambrough head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flam∣brough head.</NOTE> the course is northnorthwest nine or ten leagues, betwixt them it is shoale water of six, seven, and eight fathom deepe. Flambrough head hath many white spots and Chalke Hils, especially upon the north side towards Fyley. Flambrough hath a Head or Piere. A league to the westwards of it on the south side lyeth a little Towne called Burlington,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burling∣ton.</NOTE> which hath also a Piere. You may anchor there in the Baye in six or seven fathom.</P>
<P>Three leagues by west Flambrough head lyeth Fyley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fyley.</NOTE> in a round baye to the southwardes of a poynt that lyeth out, which hath a Pier or Head, where you may lye with∣in it, but it falleth there drie at lowe water.</P>
<P>Without the head of Fyley lyeth a rock under water, called Fyley bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fyley bridge.</NOTE> betwixt it and the Pier you may well lie a flote with a shippe of an hundred lasts, in five fa∣thom at low water, and have shelter for a northeast &amp; east winde.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Fyley to Scharbrough it is north∣west two leagues. Scharbrough<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schar∣brough.</NOTE> hath 2 Pieres or Heads, where you may runne within them at high water from the southwardes, but at low water it falleth there also drie. Men come in there from the southwards.</P>
<P>From Scharbrough the coast lyeth alongst by Robbin∣hoods bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robbin∣hoods bay</NOTE> untill before Whidbye, most northwest, but past Whidbie the land falleth in westnorthwest, &amp; by little &amp; little more westerly unto the Tees.</P>
<P>Robbenhoods bay is a good roade for a southsouth∣west and west winde, there men lie in seven or eight fa∣thom.</P>
<P>Whidby<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whid¦by.</NOTE> is a tide haven, which falleth drie at lowe water, at the east side of the haven runneth off a riffe of rocks, where of you must take heede. For to saile in there, you must runne in betwixt the two beakons, untill that you come in betwixt the two lands, and anchor there.</P>
<P>From Whidbie to the Teese the coast lyeth most west∣northwest, and west and by north, about seven leagues, betwixt both lye Huntley foote &amp; Redcliffe. Huntley<NOTE PLACE="marg">Huntley∣foot.</NOTE> foote is a high hill, lying on the sea side, about 4 leagues to the eastwardes of the Tees. Redcliffe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Redcliffe.</NOTE> lyeth about halfe wayes betwixt Huntleyfoote and the Tees, it is a cliffe of such verie redd earth, that when the sunne doth shine against it, it is to see to like redd cloth these two are verie good markes, for to know this coast by.</P>
<P>Close to the southwardes of the mouth of the Teese lye three Riffes, which lye about a halfe league east∣northeast into sea, which are verie foul and stonie, and fall drie at low water, upon the north side they are verie, flatt, so that you may sound about by them, in five, sixe &amp; seven fathom, but on the south side are so steepe that comming neare them, and sounding in thirteen and fourteen fathom, you should be upon them, before you should be able to heave the lead the second time.</P>
<P>A league and halfe to the northwards of the Teese lyeth Hartlepoole, upon a poynt that lyeth out almost
<PB N="55" REF="84"/> like an Island. For to goe in there you must runne into a bight to the southwards of the towne with in a head, untill you come against the towne, there you shall lye drie at low water.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt Hartlepoole<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hartle∣poole.</NOTE> &amp; the Teese, runneth off also a riffe of rocks thwart from the shoare a good wayes into sea, come no nearer in then, 5 or 6 fathom. There standeth a mill to the northwards of the towne Hartlepoole, if you keepe that to the west side of the towne Hartlepoole, then you cannot sail upon that foresayd riff, but if you bring the foresayd mill a little to the westwards from the town, so that you may plainely see through be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wixt the mill and the towne, then you shall not faile to saile upon that riffe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sayl into the Tees.</NOTE>For to sayle into Teese comming from the north∣wardes, you must observe these markes following. A good wayes to the northwardes off Hartlepoole, a little to the southwardes of Sonderland, and a little within the land lye upon the high land, two hommocks close one to the other, verie easy to be known, off fashion like womens breasts, called the Paps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Paps.</NOTE> keepe these 2 hommocks even without the poynt of Hartlepoole, which shall then stand from you northwest and by north, and sayle so on to the southwardes, and you shall fall before the Tees, and shall not sayle to neare the sands that lie out before the mouth of the Tees, and lye off about a halfe league into sea.</P>
<P>On both sides, as well on the north side, as the south side of the Tees stand 2 little white houses for fire beacons: If you come from the northwardes and get sight off them, then bring first the 2 southermost one in the other, which shall then stand from you south and by east, sayle right in with them, untill that the other 2 which stande on the north side of the Teese, come also one in the other, then leave them on the south side, and sayle in right with them that stand on the north side, and so you shall runne in amidst the channell, there is upon the barre, or shoalest, at low water no more then five foote, but it floweth there with a common tyde, at least 2 fathom up and downe. A southwest moone maketh there full sea. If when you come from the southwardes, you will sayle into the Teese, then bring the innermost of the 2 firebeakons (which stande on the north side) at least a handspikes length, or the length off a capstane barre, to the northwardes of the other, and runne so westwardes towards them, untill that the two firebea∣kons on the south side are one in the other, then saile in right with them, as hath beene saide, untill that the 2 firebeakons on the north side come one in the other: when you have them one the other, runne in right with them, untill that you come by the north shoare, &amp; then close alongst by it.</P>
<P>When as that you come so farre in past the first fire beakon, to wete, that you may see Hartlepoole betwixt the 2 firebeakons, there you may anchor in three, 4, or five fathom, or when Hartlepoole commeth betwixt the foresaide firebeakons, then go southsouthwest, untill that you come by the south shoare there it is also good anchoring. Further it is pilots water unto Stockton, for there within, the deepes doe shifte oftentimes, and that in shorte time, 3, 4, or 5 times in a summer.</P>
<P>He that will sayle in there with northerly windes, and a floud, must reckon well his tydes, for the floude falleth strong to the southwardes over the groundes, and should thereby bee lightlie carried behind the bank to the south∣wardes off the buye, which lyeth upon the poynte of the banck.</P>
<P>Besides this foresaid channell there runneth yet another channell through the grounds, which lye off from the north poynt of the Tees.<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail in to the newe-channell.</NOTE> For to sayle in there, you must take marke of the two high lands within the land, to the southwardes of the Tees, bring them within a handspikes length one to the other, or bring the Paps to the west side of Harlenope, then shall also a foresayde two high lands come within a handspikes length neare one to the other sayle in right with them, and so you shall runne right into that new channell, alongst through that a fore∣sayde sand, and come against the buye (upon the sandes, on the south side off the Deepe) againe in the right fare∣waye. When that you get again deeper water, or have the two fire-beakons on the north side one in the other, then go in towards them, and further as hath been before said.</P>
<P>About seven leagues to the northwardes of the Tees lyeth the river off Sonderland, a little to the northwardes off the Paps, which are very good markes for to know the land by there abouts. When the Paps are southsouth∣west from you, and that you are about an English mile from the land, then you are right before the river of Sonderland, the ground is there abouts indifferent cleane, but somewhat stonie, you may anchor there in 4 or 5, &amp; 6 fathom. On both sides, as well on the north poynte, as the south poynte of the River it is stonie. On the north poynte standeth a beakon in the water, there you must runne in, within a little shippes length alongst by it, being past that you shall gett deeper water, to with, a fathom &amp; a halfe, &amp; 2 fathom at low water, but upon the barre remaineth no more then three foote. With a common spring &amp; high water there is about 2 fathom &amp; a half, or a little more.</P>
<P>After this aforesayd first depth of a fathom and a half or two fathom, you shall meet againe with a stonie floore, about three ships lenghts broad, upon it is at high water about 11 or 12 foote deep, according as the tydes shall runne: being over there, it is again deeper. A little past that is a narrow place, where a long shippe shall scarce be able to wend, within it, it is wide enough, and very where good anchor ground.</P>
<P>From the Tees to Tinmouth the course is northnorth∣west 8 or 9 leagues. Two leagues to the southwards of Tinmouth lyeth the poynt of Sonderland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sonder∣land.</NOTE> but close to the southwards of Tinmouth goeth in the River of New-castle. From the poynt of Tinmouth shooteth off a led∣ge of rocks, you must sayle in by it, leaving it on the starboard side. The markes for to sayle into this River are two firetowers or firebeakons, which stand upon the north shoare, bring them one in the other, or the inner∣most (that is the highest) a little to the northwards of the outermost or lowest, &amp; sayle so right in, alongst by the aforesayd ledge of rocks on the north side, and so you shall have upon the shoalest two fathom at halfe floud, a southwest moone maketh there full sea. The south shoare is flatte you may lead it in there with the sounding pole, for ships, that goe not deepe, in ten foote at halfe floude. When you come within, runne all alongst by the north shoare, untill past the little towne Sheels, edge then over to the other shoare, untill you come through the crooked reach, there the river lieth up againe a little to the n. wards, &amp; then to the southwards to Hawkes-bill, &amp; about by it to the towne New-castle.</P>
<P>Seven or 8 leagues to the northwards of Tinmouth lyeth the Cocke Island, betwixt them both about half wayes lyeth a River called Bly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bly.</NOTE> where the French men doe much sayle to fetch coale. From the north poynt of this river runneth off a ledge of rocks a great shot of a cast-peece; about southeast into the sea, but the south side, &amp; the coast to the southwards of it, is very cleane and sand-strand. Upon the south poynt stand two bea∣kons: If you will sayle in there, bring them one in the other, and sayle right in with them, and then you can take no hurt of the foresayd ledge or riffe of the north poynt. When that you come by or thwart of the ou∣termost of the 2 foresayd beakons, you shall see there by it another smaller beakon, that standeth upon a little ledge off rocks, that shooteth off from the south poynt, leave that on the larboard side, and runne in alongst close about northwards of it. The foresayd ledge of Roc∣kes on the north side remaineth at high water (a good wayes from the land, and also at a spring-tyde) above water, within it is a bight, there it is good lying for a
<PB N="56" REF="85"/> north or northeast winde, and there remaineth at low water two fathom depth. In the mouth of the River it is with an ordinary tyde and high water about two fathom deep, or somewhat more, and it floweth there two fa∣thom up and downe, so that at low water it falleth allmost altogether dry.</P>
<P>The Cocket Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cocket Island.</NOTE> is a very little Island, &amp; not high it lyeth about a halfe league from the land, you may come to anchor in it for an east, south, &amp; southeast wind, but the winde comming to the northwards of the east, maketh there a bad roade, for you must lye betwixt the Island and the maine land where you have no shelter for a north winde. On the south side of the Island the ground is foul, &amp; a little to the southwards of the Island, runneth off a foule ledge of rocks from the shoare, untill thwart or past the Island. He that commeth from the southwards, must keepe the Coast of Bambrough with∣out the Island, or els he should not faile to saile upon the poynt of that foresayd ledge.</P>
<P>Betwixt that ledge and the Island it is also very nar∣row, so that a man standing at low water marke upon the rockes of this ledge, should allmost be able to cast with a stone unto the Island. For to sayle in there, take heed unto these marcks here after described: there stand∣eth a house upon the sea side, which is a Salt kettel, and also a Castle somewhat further in within the land, which doth shew it self high enough, bring them one in the other, &amp; then they shall stand somewhat more northerly then west from you, and runne so right in with them, and so you shall runne in right amidst the channell be∣twixt both, being come within, edge up behinde the Island, &amp; anchor there in five or six fathom.</P>
<P>About this Island there run also manie more divers little Rivers in to the land, but they fall most drie at low water.</P>

<P>S. Abbens head &amp; the Island the Bas lye east and west 4 leagues assunder. The Island May &amp; S. Abbens head northwest &amp; southeast 4 great leagues. May &amp; Bas lye one from the other southwest &amp; by west and northeast &amp; by east three leagues &amp; a halfe. The Bas<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bas.</NOTE> is a high round Rock cleane round about, which you may sayle alongst by on both sides. Betwixt the rock and the south shoare it is ten and twelve fathom deepe, but the common faire way is alongst to the northwards of it. Betweene S. Abbens head and the Bas it is most part a cleane Coast, but without anchor ground. The Island May<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island May.</NOTE> is greater then the Bas, &amp; also cleane round about, except on the east side, there it is foule.</P>

Betweene the Bas and Inchkieth by the s. shoare lye many Rockes▪ little Islands and foule grounds, where at divers places is road, but are not to be used, but by them which are there verie well acquainted. Inchkieth and Island May lye s. w. &amp; by w. &amp; n. e. &amp; by e. 7 great leagues asunder. Inchkieth is somewhat a long small Island, a league to the northwards of it lyeth an out poynt on the north coast called Kingornesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kingor∣nesse.</NOTE> before it and about it lie some little Rocks under water but a little to the eastwards of the eastwards of the point is good anchor ground &amp; road for westerly winds.

On both sides of Inchkieth is good ground, &amp; good lying as well for westerly as easterly winds.</P>
<P>From Inchkieth to Lieth it is southeast a league. Before Lieth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lieth.</NOTE> about halfe an English mile from the shoare lyeth a Rock upon which standeth a Mast (with a crosse or some other thing of wood upon the top of it) for a beakon. At high water the Sea floweth over it, &amp; at low water it falleth dry. With a spring tyde at low water men may go on foot to it. From the east side of that Rock lyeth off a Riffe almost unto Inchkieth. You may also run through to the southwards of Inckieth betwixt that foresayd Riffe &amp; the south shoare, but is not to be done, but by them which are there exceeding well acquainted: There is alto∣gether full of Rockes &amp; foule grounds. When as you sayle in to the northwards of Inchkieth you must leave the foresayd Mast on the larboard side, and run about to the northwards of it, &amp; then towards the south shoare, and anchor about halfe an English Mile by west Lieth, and also halfe an English Mile from the shoare, in 6, 7, or 8 fathom. Lieth the Haven Edenbrough are tyde Havens which fall dry at low water.</P>
<P>From Lieth to Queenes Ferrie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queenes Ferrie.</NOTE> there lye on both sides many Rockes, some above and some under water. In the Narrow before Queenes Ferrie lyeth a little Island called Inchgarve which you must runne alongst to the north∣wards of, on the south side it is with a Stone bancke (where men may goe over at low water) fast to the mayne Land, alongst to the northwards of it, it is cleane and deepe.

<P>THe Island Fairhill<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairhill.</NOTE> lyeth from the east point of the Orcanais northeast, &amp; from Boeckenesse north and by west about seven and thirty leag.</P>
<P>On the west side of Fairhill is at some places foule ground, but upon the southeast side is good anchor ground, there you may anchor every where but there stretcheth a riffe on the east side of the shoare off south∣east two leagues in to sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fulo.</NOTE>Fulo lyeth from Fairehill northwest and by north tenne leagues, betwixt them both lyeth the southermost poynt off Hitland, lying from Fairehill northnortheast 7 or 8 leagues, and from Fulo east and by south, 4 leagues.</P>
<P>The southwest coast of Hitland, (to witt from the southermost poynt to the northwest poynt) lyeth north∣west and by north eight or nine leagues. On the same southwest side, over against the Island Fulo lyeth a Sand-bay, where men may anchor, but on the east side of this Bay, it is somewhat foule. From that northwest or west poynt off to the north end, the land of Hitland lyeth northeast by north, &amp; southwest and by south, twenty or one and twenty leagues.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northwards of the foresaid west poynt lyeth the Haven of S. Magnus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Mag∣nus.</NOTE> which is a broad Sound, within it is good anchor ground in sixteen or seventeen fathom depth, according as you shall be farre within the land. On the north side lyeth a high rocke, where you must run in to the southwards of. And on the south side lyeth two or three rocks, which you must leave on the starboard side, when you sayle in there.</P>
<P>Even to the eastwards about the s. poynt of Hitland, lyeth a fayre Sand-bay, where you may anchor in twelve or thirteen fathom, from thence to Hanglip, the course is northeast somewhat easterly 8 or 9 leagues.</P>
<P>Betwixt Hanglip<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hanglip.</NOTE> and the south poynt lyeth an Island, which you may sayle about on both sides, within it lyeth Hambrough Haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ham∣brough haven.</NOTE> or the Scottish Haven which is a lade place for the Hamburgers and Scots. This Haven is also called Bremer Haven. There lyeth also a high steepe poynt to the southwards of Hanglip, to the south∣wards of it men doe runne into Broad-sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Broad-sound.</NOTE> the chiefest Haven of all Hitland, which is deepe and hath cleane ground, there men doe lye landlockt for all winds.</P>
<P>From the Broad Sound lyeth a Sound in alongst to the northwards, through the land, which commeth out againe into the sound to the northwards, and so maketh an Island of the land whereupon the high hill Hanglip lyeth. When as you will sayle in there from the north∣wards, that is to the northwards of Hanglip, you must runne in nearest by the south shoare, and edge to it beti∣mes. In this channell betwixt both lands lye two Islands or rocks, the greatest lyeth nearest the north shoare, and the smallest nearest the south shoare, betwixt them both lyeth also a suncken rocke, which at low water is unco∣vered, and at high water you may know it by the brea∣king upon it. When as you will sayle in here, you must leave the foresayd greatest Rocke, with the suncken rock, on the starboard side, and the smallest rock on the larboard side, there is upon the shoalest three fathom and a halfe water.</P>
<P>Within this haven lye also two havens at the north point, which lye into the land, where is good lying.</P>
<P>When as you will sayle from this foresayd haven through within unto the Broad-sound, you shall meet, scarce halfe wayes with a rock, from which lyeth off a risse towards the west shoare thwart of it you must runne close alongst by the west shoare, for to avoid that riffe.</P>
<P>To the northwards of Hanglip▪ the land of Hitland lyeth north, north and by east, and northnortheast, at least north, and at some places you may sayle in through Hitland, especially to the northwards of Walsoeu, where a faire broad Sound lyeth northwest through, there is good anchor ground to finde at some places, for these that are there acquainted. From Hanglip to the north∣east point of Hitland, the course is northnortheast ten leagues, there lie some outrocks called the Outschares.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Outscares</NOTE> From thence alongst to the north point of Hitland, the course is north about 4 leagues.</P>
<P>A little about the east point goeth in a faire haven, called Bloem-sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bloem-sound.</NOTE> lying in southwest. On the west side lyeth a long rock, you must sayle into the eastwards of it, and anchor a little within the Haven, it is there within
<PB N="60" REF="91"/> all cleane sand ground, and good lying. Bloem-sound lyeth in first (as hath been said) southsouthwest afterwards south and south and by east, on both sides is good anchor ground, there you may saile altogether through, and come out againe through Jelle-sound into sea, about the Island Fero.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of the Islands of Fero.</NOTE>The greatest and chiefest Islands of Fero are 12, in number, as Suydro, Sando, Moggenes, Wage, Stromo, Ostro, Calso, Cuno, Bordo, Wydro, Swyno and Fulo.</P>
<P>The little Islands of Fero are ten, as Littledymen, Stoerdymen, Schuyvo, Dalsfles, Hesden, Trallo Colster, Moggensholme, the Monck, and the Bishop. Besides these there are yet some rocks and little Islands, to seven or eight in number.</P>
<P>The southermost great Island called Suydro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suydro.</NOTE> lyeth most southeast and northwest, about seven or eight leagues. At the southeast end of this Island lyeth a high rock, called the Monck, or Sambie, after the name of the first or southermost haven in Suydro. Betwixt the Monck<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monck Samby.</NOTE> and the south<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st end of the Island Suydro, is a race or Well, which men must avoid especially with spring tides.</P>
<P>Upon the west side of the Island Suydro are no havens for to save any shippes in, but it is altogether high steepe land. On the North side are maine havens, where men may sayle into and save ships, as Sommersound or Hest, Hofwycke. Vrobie, Quaelbie or Rane, all broad sounds or havens, a countrie man or Pilot can bring you in there every where to your desire.</P>
<P>From the Northwest end Suydro to Moggensholme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mogge∣nes-holm.</NOTE> the westermost and outermost Island of Fero, the course is northwest and by north, and northnorthwest about eight leagues.</P>
<P>At the east end of Moggenesholme lyeth Moggenes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mogenes Wage.</NOTE> to the eastwards of it lyeth the Island Waghe, and to the eastwards of Waghe goeth in a faire Sound from the southwards off from the Island Sando about Hesten &amp; the Island Colster, for you may run in about these Islands on both sides, &amp; leave the great Island Stromo on the east side, and so come into Waghe. In the middest of the Sound of Waghe, goeth up a haven to the eastwards into the great Island Stromo, there in you may anchor in ten or twelve fathom, but the Sound is at least twenty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Moggenes &amp; the northeast end Fero lie eastnortheast or a little more northerlye, &amp; westsouthwest about fifteene leagues assunder. Betwixt them both lye tenne Islands, and betwixt each Island, is a faire broade &amp; deep Sound where of the fourth off from Moggenes is called Somsound.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Som∣sound.</NOTE> All these Sounds lye most northnorthwest and southsoutheast through the land, and upon all these Islands stand Churches, except upon Ostra, which never the lesse is a great Island.</P>
<P>From the southeast end of Suydro to Scalhead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scalhead.</NOTE> or the southeast end of the Island Sando, the course is north and by west about five leagues.

<P>From Schalhead untill within the Island Mulso (lying before Stromo) the course is north and by west foure leagues, there you may every where anchor, where you will in twentie, thirtie or fortie fathom. If any man com∣ming in out of the sea, desireth to see a good road or ha∣ven under the Islands of Fero, he shall keepe that mid∣dlemost great Island Stromo northwest and northwest and by west from him, and then hee shall see upon the middest of the Island Stromo a high steepe hill called Schellinck, which he must sayle right in with, and so he shall meete with that foresayd Island Mulso, a low Island, which you may sayle about on both sides, but it is best for to runne in there at the south, under this Island is all over good anchor ground. Right over against this Island, on the great Island, lyeth Torshaven, the chiefest haven of Fero, where all the trade of merchandize is.</P>
<P>From Torshaven<NOTE PLACE="marg">Torshavē</NOTE> or the Island Mulso to the northeast end of Fero the course is northeast, and northeast and by east about twelve or thirteene leagues, betwixt them both lye seven Islands, &amp; betwixt each Island (as hath been sayd) goeth a broad Sound thorow the land, lying through about northwest a broad thorow the land, lying northnorthwest. The north end of Fero is about foure leagues broad, and lyeth northwest and southeast, and is called Fulo, thwart of it lieth the Bishop.</P>
<P>He that desireth to sayle off from Mulso into Som∣sound, let him goe on northeast &amp; by north three leag.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fulo.</NOTE> unto the poynt of Bordenes, then up northwest off from Bordenes, &amp; then he shall espie a Church upon the Island Calso, which he must leave on the starboard side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bi∣shop.</NOTE> &amp; goe in along westnorthwest untill he come into the Bight of the Island Ostro, and anchor there in seventeene or eighteene fathom.</P>

<P>From Scotland westwards and to the northwards of Ireland, lye many Islands, whereof we shall here describe some, with so much perfection, as thereof is yet knowne.</P>
<P>The names of the principall Islands<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of the Is∣lands.</NOTE> lying there are these: Areu, Ila, Jona, Mulla, Bragedull, Hun, Lewis S. Patricius, S. Maria, S. Colane, S.

There are yet some small Islands: as Rona, Ghent, Trauta, Fladde, Grand Melul, Petit Melul, Stalpan, Cannay, Rum, Egghe, Mule, Cutte, Carndenbrough, Gronsay, S. Karbo, Lismont, Swynoy, Machare, Gegay, Caray, &amp; Navarsay. All these Islands doe lye and belong under Scotland, and are those which by the Cosmographers are called Insulae Hebrides.</P>
<P>The Island Barre or Rona<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barre or Rona.</NOTE> is the northermost Island lying behinde Scotland, &amp; lyeth from Fulo about west∣southwest 37 or 38 leagues, it lyeth by two other little Islands about a greate league one from the other.</P>
<P>The Islands of Lewis lye from Rona southwest distant sixteen or seventeen leagues, and from the north end of Lewis to S. Kilda, it is southwest and by west, 16 leagues.</P>
<P>On the east side of S. Kilda is a good roade for a west and northwest winde. This Island lyeth by the other little Island where of the two are not very great, upon that which lyeth to the westwards, you may see some houses stand, and these two little Islands lye tenne leag. to the westwards of the great Island of Lewis. Upon the coast of Lewis lye also two rowes of great rocks, like as if they where little Islands, lying one from the other south &amp; north somewhat easterly about 7 or 8 leagues.</P>
<P>The southermost lye by 3 little Islands, but the north∣ermost lye by eight small little Islands or rocks.</P>
<P>The Island of Lewis is devided into many parts, the which men may sayle through at many and divers places. Lewis with the Islands belonging to it lye south∣southwest and south and by west about 29 leagues.</P>
<P>But on the east side goeth a broade Sound through of five or six leagues. Men sayl in close by the Island of Lewis, about southsouthwest untill past the Island Cheut.</P>
<P>From thence the Sound lyeth through betwixt the great Island Bragadull &amp; Lewis south &amp; south &amp; by west towards the west end of Lewis, called the Ephts, then you must leave Mulla and Ila, with divers many other Islands on the larboard side.</P>
<P>Jona, Ila, Mulla &amp; Bragadul are 4 of the greatest Islands, which are lying on the west coast of Scotland, and lye close by the mayn land, but there are many havens &amp; Sounds, so that there you may sayle in and about them every where.</P>
<P>At the northwest point of Ireland lye also some Islands, which you may sayle through &amp; round about them all.</P>
<P>Betwixt Rona &amp; Orkneys lye also some Islands which also you may sayle through betwixt and round about.</P>
<P>He that falleth with these Islands must be very care∣full and circumspect, for the most part of them are in∣habited by wild and savage people.</P>

<HEAD>The third Demonstration, In which Are shewed the Sea-coastes betweene the North-Cape and the River of Kola.</HEAD>
<P>EAst and by south about 11 or 12 leagues from the north-Cape lyeth north-Kyne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Northkyn</NOTE> From north-Kyne to Tannebay it is eastsoutheast 10 or 11 leagues, between both, it is all a cleane coast, without Rockes or foule grounds, a high steepe craggie land, without any strand.</P>
<P>When as you come sayling alongst past North-Kyne, towards Tannebaye, you shall meete first with the poynt of Slechtnes, a plaine poynt lying out, verie easy to be known: and then Omega a Fisher village, standing on the Sea side, even there to the eastwards of it goeth in the Tannebay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanebay.</NOTE> which is a great deepe River which lyeth in first south, &amp; afterwards, southwest farre within the land, &amp; doth devide it self into two parts, at the mouth of the River, it is at last two leagues or more broad, and all over verie deepe. He that is bound into the Tannebay, must run in alongst by the west shoare, because he must lye by the west shoare, on the eastside is no road or place, where men may anchor.</P>
<P>On the foresayd w. side are manie points &amp; bayes to see to as if they were roads, but you must saile past them all so long, untill that you se on the same w. shoare a rounde hil, whereupon standeth a Warder, a little past that, stand some Fishermens houses, upon a low hommock, twhart of these houses runneth of from the land a low flatt point, you must runne in behind that point, &amp; anchor before those houses, with an anchor to seaward &amp; a hawser fast on the land.</P>
<P>A little to the eastwards of Tannebay lyeth the poynt, &amp; the land of Matkorf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matkorf</NOTE> from thence to Wardhouse the coast lyeth southeast and by east, southeast, and most southeast &amp; by south sixteene leagues, betwixt them there is much high plaine land. Halfe wayes betwixt both, but nearest Wardhouse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ward∣house.</NOTE> lyeth a high hommock upon the high land, to see to like a castle, or Countrie house, verie easy to be knowne, being thwart of it close by land, it seemeth as if there were a great Sound, where men might saile into Wardhouse are three little Islands with some little rocks also by them, the southermost is the greatest of the three, which onely is inhabited, upon it is a village of about 300 Norway houses with a castle, it is abouts a half league long, and lyeth an English myle off from the land, lying as the coast most south &amp; north, betwixt both, it is all over deep water. On the south side of this Island, lyeth a haven or great baye about half wayes the Island, and likewise one also on the north side, so that these two bayes doe come so neare one to the other that there remaineth no more then a narrow chindle strand about a stone cast broade, dividing so the Island almost into 2, the eastermost part is the shortest, &amp; highest, the westermost the longest. Close upon the strand, on the east side of the souther-haven lyeth the Castle, to the northwards of it, upon the foresaide chindle strād, &amp; about the Bayestrand the houses. In the souther Bay it is good lying, but the best road is betwixt the maine
<PB N="68" REF="101"/> land and the Island, about halfe wayes on the side of the Island against a Sandbay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade Kilduyn.</NOTE> and right against the Castle, there is good anchor-ground, in tenne or twelve fathom landlockt for all winds, except for north and south winds, which blow there right through, yet men have some shelter of some poynt of the Island. Men may without feare come in there, betwixt the Island and the Manie, either from the southwards or the northwards, it is all over cleanie and cleare, but he that commeth in from the northwards, must runne somewhat nearer the Rock, where the gallowes standeth upon, then the Is∣land, because thereabouts the Island is a little foule.</P>
<P>About a shott of a Cast peece northwards from the greatest, lye the two smallest close one to another, seem∣ing afarre off to be one Island, are together not an English myle long, but high and rocky to see to, there lye also two or three rocks by them.</P>
<P>On this coast like as at the north-Cape a northeast &amp; southwest moone maketh high water.</P>
<P>From Ward-house to the poynt of Kegor or the Fishers Island, the course is southeast and southeast and by south ten leagues.</P>
<P>Betwixt them both is a great baye, wherein are divers Sounds &amp; rivers, amongst other the River Pitsing, which is a great faire and large River, where men may goe in with great shipps, a good wayes within the river is good road, there is taken and laden much Salmon, but there fall no other speciall wares. Southsouthwest from the poynt off Kegor lye two Islands, to the southwards of them men doe runne into Monnick-forde.</P>
<P>Kegor is a fayre haven, lying at the north end of the Fishers Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kegor or Fishers Island.</NOTE> a little without the poynt; There lye two or three rocks at the north poynt of the haven, and also a suncken rock in the middest of the havens mouth; you leave the suncken Rock, with the other Rocks on the starboard side of you, and runne in by the south shoare and edge then behinde the foresayd rocks, and anchor there in seven or eight fathom, the havens mouth lyeth in southwest, it is there so good lying as in any havens thereabouts on the coast.</P>
<P>The Danes call this haven Easter-haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Easterha∣ven.</NOTE> there was wont to be the Staple of the Fish, where every one must come to buye: therefore the Island is yet called, whereon Kegor lyeth, the Fishers Island.</P>
<P>It is indeede no Island, but very neare: it is fast to the maine land, with such a very small neck, that the Russes, which come from Kilduyn, or the River of Kool, and are bound to the River Pitsing, doe goe alongst within this land, &amp; hawle their boates over that small neck, for not to goe about a seaboard.</P>
<P>From Kegor to Laus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laus.</NOTE> the course is alongst the shoare southeast and by south, somewhat easterly nine or ten leagues. This is a right playne coast; without poynts or bayes, all alongst by Laus to Tiepena, but the south poynt of Laus lyeth out a little, upon which stand two Warders, to the northwards of that poynt is the haven of Laus, a fayre sand-bay, there is very easy lying for southerly or easterly winds, but not for northerly winds, the winds betweene the northermost and north∣east doe blowe there open in, and make therein a very great hollow sea, men lye there in twelve, tenne and eight fathom, according as they runne farre in, the far∣ther the shoaler, but all cleane rising sand-ground.</P>
<P>From Laus a little towards Kegor lyeth a little Island, behinde which is good anchoring for easterly winds, in cleane sand-ground, but it is somewhat narrow.</P>
<P>From Laus to Tiepena,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tiepena.</NOTE> it is a great halfe league, at the poynt lye some little rockes, but you cannot see them, before you be close to them. Tiepena is a fayre haven, when you come from the northwards, you must runne so farre to the southwards, alongst by the shoare, untill that you see open into it, and sayle in amidst the channell. When as you come from the southwards, the haven openeth it selfe, being come in, you must edge up to the northwards, and anchor there, there you lye land-lockt for all winds, there are no dangers which may hurt you, but it is over all cleare and cleane sandy ground.</P>
<P>A little about the poynt, to the southwards of Tiepe∣na, which is on the southwest side of the Fishers Island is another faire haven, where men may goe to an∣chor, called Kowens.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kowens.</NOTE></P>
<P>From Laus to the River of Kola, the course is south and by east and southsoutheast about tenne leagues. But Kilduyn and Laus lye southeast and by south, some∣what easterly and northwest &amp; by north, somewhat westerly also tenne leagues assnder.</P>

<HEAD>The fourth Demonstration, Where in Are described the Sea-Coastes of Lapland betweene the River of Kola and Islands of Swetenoes.</HEAD>
<P>FOr to sayle up into the River of Kool or Kola,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ri∣ver of Kool.</NOTE> you must goe from Laus, or the south end of the Fishers Island towards the River southsoutheast and south and by east, run about by the high land of Poden-wolck, and then the River shall open it selfe very wide. When you are by the poynt of Laus, you may see the Island Kilduyn, and the River of Koole, or the land by it, Betwixt Laus and the River of Koole, is al∣so a great baye.</P>
<P>When as you are in the mouth of the River, it lyeth in first south and by west, and then southsouthwest, to that Island, which standeth marked with <HI>A</HI> in the Carde of this, River, and then by little and little southwest and by south, alongst by the Island marked with <HI>B</HI> unto the Trayne Island then southwest and by west, and by little and little about the poynt west &amp; by south, afterwards in west, unto Divels poynt, over against it lyeth the White stone, which lyeth upon the land, thwart of it is good roade. From thence againe west and south, west∣southwest and southsouthwest unto Kool.</P>
<P>When as you come into the River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road in the River.</NOTE> and will seeke roade there, you must keepe alongst by the west shoare, being somewhat within, you shall see a little Island lying close by the shoare: from thence somewhat further about the high poynt is a Bight or Baye, and in that Bight a Sand-baye, where men may save a shippe with∣out Anchor or Cable, that is a faire Sand-baye, where men may runne in all alongst.</P>
<P>Alongst by the north side it is five fathom deepe, and cleane sand-ground, men runne in there betwixt the two poyntes, but there lyeth a black Rock in the narrow, betwixt both shoares, which they must leave lying on the starboard side, within that rock it three and two fathom deepe unto the strand, within there is faire greene fields.</P>
<P>A little without the Baye lye two Islands, where of the outermost or eastermost is the smallest. When as in sayling up alongst the River, you may come by these two foresayd little Islands about halfe wayes to the Island marked with <HI>A,</HI> there is also good roade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade three Kings.</NOTE> at the west shoare, you shall see upon the high Land three Warders called the three Kings, thwart of them is the roade.</P>
<P>When you are somewhat past the Island <HI>A</HI> you can∣not see the River any more open, but it seemeth to bee shut, and close, for that Island by <HI>A</HI> commeth then un∣der the high land, on the east side.</P>
<P>Under the Island marked with <HI>B</HI> is also good road<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade.</NOTE> and cleane sand-ground.</P>
<P>Likewise is also good road under the Trayne Island, that is reckoned for the halfe of the River, to witt off from the mouth of Kool.</P>
<P>When as you come now a little past the Trayne Island, where the <HI>C</HI> standeth, then you shall see out a head a black blewe hill, called the Divels hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divelshill.</NOTE> it seemeth meth there, as if the River were close and shut. It is best sayling alongst by the starboard side, there you have most all ground close by the land. There are many Bights, poynts, and Bayes, which are not all to be des∣cribed.</P>
<P>On the other side men doe not come so commonly, (except it be against their wills) there seeme also to bee many bayes and roades, and also some little Rivers. When as you come alongst by the Divels hill, where the <HI>D</HI> standeth, past the White stone, then you may see the Klinck-hill on the west side, and almost all alongst unto Kool. When as you may see the Klinck-hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Klinckhil.</NOTE> there is ground by the west shoare for to anchor in, then the∣reare on both sides no daungers, but when as you come so far into the place, where the letter <HI>E</HI> standeth mar∣ked,

<PB N="71" REF="104"/> there you must somewhat shunne the west shoare, because of a little shoale which shooteth off from the shoare, and keepe in the middle of the channell, untill that you come against the Klinck-hill, there you must againe goe close alongst by it, in the middest of the fare∣way lyeth an Island of Rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rocke.</NOTE> which at high water is covered, where of you must take good heed.</P>
<P>From the Klinck-hill unto the Robben Island<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robben Island.</NOTE> sayle all alongst by the west shoare, the Robben Island is also covered at high water, but when it is under water, then anchor thwart of the burnt trees. Thwart of the Robben Island lyeth a very great rock, as sone as you are thwart of the high land, looke out carefully for it, keepe without it, or to the northwards of it, to witt a bow shot, there is the roade, there you may anchor by the shoare so shoale as you please, it is there good lying, and there you begin to see Kool alongst by the house. Betwixt the Island Kilduyn and the River of Kola, somewhat nearer the River than the Island, lyeth a haven, called Bliesna Silensi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bliesna Silensi.</NOTE> that is so say, the next to Silensi, there you sayle in by a round reddish Hommock, being come within it, you must edge up to the westwards, so that the haven is altogether shut, and that you can see no sea, you may anchor there so deepe or shoale as you will, it is there every where cleare and cleane white sandy ground, and somewhat oazye and soft, there you may also without feare sayle on against the shoare in the oaze, and so may save a shippe without anchor or cables.</P>
<P>The Island Kilduyn<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kilduyn.</NOTE> is about two leagues long, and one league broade, and lyeth westnorthwest and eastsouth∣east alongst the land, like as also the channell betwixt the Island &amp; the maine land, which is at some places about a halfe league broade, and at some places, narrow∣er, but all over very deepe and cleane. About the mid∣dest, yet nearest the cast end, is a faire close road, betwixt two poynts, that lye out towards the maine land, there men lye under the Island, close to the shoare, before the Laps tents, under the eastermost poynt, which is a low playne poynt, in twelve, thirteene, or fourteene fathom, sand-ground, more to the southwards, it is very deepe you shall soone have fifty and sixty fathom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to go into Kil∣duyn from the west∣wards.</NOTE>If you will goe to anchor under Kilduyn comming from the northwards or the westwards, then runne about by the west end, in betwixt Kilduyne and the mayne land. When you are come somewhat within, you shall espy a little round Island, there the Channell beginneth to be narrow, yet it is broade enough for to turne to windwards through, sayle forth towards the southeast end, untill you come in betwixt those two poynts, and run to the foresayd low poynt, and anchor there within the bight, before the cabbens so neare to the land as you please, there you lye landlockt for all winds, as if you lay within a towne in a close haven.</P>
<P>For to saile in from the eastwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into Kil∣duyn from the east∣wards.</NOTE> you must sayle in to the westwards by the east end, so long untill that you come by the foresayd low poynte of the Island, then edge up about it to the northwards, and runne into the fore∣sayd bight, before the Cabbens, and anchor there in twelve, thirteene and fourteene fathom, that is the chie∣fest roade.</P>
<P>At the north and east end of Kilduyn, betwixt the Island and the maine land, there is also a very good roade, in eight, tenne or twelve fathom, where men may lye sheltered for all winds. Thereabouts is on the Island a good water place, there the water commeth running off from the high land, there men may goe lye by it, and fill their caskes lying in the boate.</P>
<P>You may also anchor under the maine land, betwixt the narrow, and the Roade of Kilduyn, at the place where the anchor standeth marked, in the Carde. At the east end of Kilduyn lyeth also a Fishers village, cal∣led Kammen, at a high poynt, which is called the Sacri∣fice poynt.</P>
<P>From the Island Kilduyn to the poynt Tiribiry, the course is southeast and by east about five leagues be∣twixt them is a great bay. In this bay, a great league from Kilduyn lyeth a high Island called Bliesna Olinie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bliesna Olinie.</NOTE> which is the next or the nearest Olinie, behinde it, un∣der the mayne land, nearest the south end of the Island is a good road, where three or foure ships may lye very well.</P>
<P>The lyeth a round hill, or high Hommock upon the maine land, which sheweth out above all the other hom∣mockes▪, and is very easy to be knowne, upon which standeth a high crosse of two crosses one above the other, to the northwards off it lyeth a flat poynt, thwart of it lye some rocks alongst the shoare, which at high water are covered.</P>
<P>At the south end of the Island Olinie, a little from land, lyeth a rock almost even with the water, but you may alwayes see it well by the breaking of the water.</P>
<P>To the Northwards of the Island about an English myle, lyeth a rock not farre from land, and also to sea∣wards from it a suncken rocke, which you cannot goe over at low water.</P>
<P>Hee that will (comming from the northwards) goe to anchor behinde Olinie, must runne a good wayes to the eastwards of this foresayd rocke alongst to the northwards of the Island, for to avoid the foresaid rocke. Being come behinde the Island, you shall espy the fore∣sayd round hommock with the crosse, you must not runne past the crosse, but leave it on the larboard side, and sayle inclose by it for to avoyd the foresayd rockes, which lye off from the flat north poynt, the poynt with the crosse is very cleane and so steepe, that you might lye with a ship on against the shoare without any hurt.</P>
<P>He that will come into this Road from the southwards, let him run alongst by the coaste, which is very cleane, untill past the foresayd poynt with the crosse, and edge up close about by it, as is beforesayd.</P>
<P>Men doe anchor within the poynt in seven, sixe, five, foure and three fathom, deepe or shoale as they will, there goeth no grown sea at all.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt the Island Olinie and Tiri∣biry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tiribiry.</NOTE> is another haven or great Bay, where men may lye landlockt for all winds.</P>
<P>Tiribiry is a great River and off-water, where is a great Salmon fishing, there men may goe in with great ship∣pes, and anchor every where within it where they will in good sandy-ground, it lyeth in most south, and after∣wards more westerly, the eastermost poynt lyeth out more to seawards than the other, so that it maketh a bay, where men ride under for a northwest winde.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the southwards of Tiribiry lyeth Waronia, which is a great sand-bay or haven, with at the mouth is narrow, but within it is a broad Sound, there is also an off-water, where is also much Salmon caught.</P>
<P>Within this bay it is every where good anchoring, shoale water and cleane ground.</P>
<P>Before the mouth of this haven lye three little Islands, behinde them is also good road.</P>
<P>Two leagues or two leagues &amp; a halfe to the south∣wards of Waronia lyeth a Gabriele,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gabriele.</NOTE> a tyde haven, which falleth dry within, so that men may goe over there dry at low water, it floweth there twelve foot up and downe, a southsouthwest moone maketh high water on this coast.</P>
<P>In the mouth of this haven lye three Islands, two on the north side (which are the lowest) and one on the south side, that is the highest, you must runne neerest the southermost when as you will sayle in there: being come within the Islands, you must edge up to the north∣wards behinde the two northermost Islands, and anchor there on the north side of the haven, there it is seven and eight fathom deepe cleane ground.</P>
<P>About a league to the southwards of it lyeth Salensi Daelna,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daelna Silensi.</NOTE> that is to say, the farther Silensi; but betwixt them both a little to the northwards of Silensi, lyeth yet a great indraught which lyeth in at least two leagues into the land, and is about so wyde as the River Tye before
<PB N="72" REF="105"/> Amsterdam, there may lye a great multitude of shippes, it is there broade and large enough, and all over good anchor ground.</P>
<P>A little to the northwards of this in-draught lieth a little Island, or rock, somewhat high, about which you may sayle within, to witt, through betwixt these rockes and the land, but may make no road under them.</P>
<P>Salensi Daelna<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daelna Silensi.</NOTE> is a great broad bay, before it lye three Islands, which are to see to gray of colour, as the mayne land.</P>
<P>To the northwards of these Islands upon the poynt off the bay standeth 3 great Warders, and a little to the southwards of the Islands, on the mayne land lyeth a steepe hill, by which markes this bay is very easy to be knowne.</P>
<P>If you will sayle into this bay comming from the north∣wards alongst the shoare by the foresayd great in-draught, a little to the northwards of this baye, you must looke out for these foresayd great Warders, leave them on the starbord side, &amp; sayle in close by them, through betwixt that poynt and the Islands, first westsouthwest, somewhat within, and then more southerly, untill behind the Islands, and anchor there in five, six, or seven fathom: you may also sayle further to the southwards into the baye, so deepe as you will, there it is all over cleane.</P>
<P>When you come before the channell, it seemeth to bee very narrow, but it is broad enough.</P>
<P>To the southwards of these Islands is also a channell which is very narrow, but yet for need you may sayle out there. The southermost Island, that is, whereupon the Fishermen dwel, is fast to the northermost with a shoale, whereupon is at high water 10 or 11 foot water, but at low water you cannot goe over it.</P>
<P>Two little leagues to the southwards of Salensi lyeth the Island Daelna Olinie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daelna Olinie.</NOTE> that is to say, the Furthest Olinie, it is an Island almost of Fashion like Bliesna Olinie, at the north end high, at the south end lower, and upon the end very steepe, it hath in the middest, (but some what neerer the south end then the north end) a low valley, where at high water the sea doth almost run alongst over it.</P>
<P>Behinde this Island, not under the Island, but under the mayne land, are good roades.</P>
<P>For to come in from the northwards behind this Island, it is a broad, large, and very deepe Channell, without any dangers, but if you will sayle in behinde it (from the southwards) then you must runne in close by the Island, for to avoyde a foule and stony riffe, which lyeth off from the maine land, halfe wayes to the Island, and so shoale that it falleth dry with the spring tydes at low water.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes the Island, nearest the south end, is a point, lying out from the mayne land, twoards the Island, to the northwards of it men doe anchor in 6, 7, or 8 fathom.</P>
<P>When you come in from the northwards, you may (so soone as you come within the points) lusse up towards close about the point of the main land into a bay, &amp; anchor there in eight, six, five or foure fathom, according as you sayle far in, there it is very easy lying. In these roades under the mayne land, it is all cleane &amp; flat rising ground, but under the Island it is deepe, and the ground rising very steep, &amp; therefore it is not good ancho∣ring there.</P>
<P>Betwixt this Island Daelna Olinie, &amp; Silensi, lye 3 little black Islands, where is very easy road under them in 8, 7, and 6, fathom.</P>
<P>From Daelna Olinie to Rinde<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rinde.</NOTE> are five leagues. Rinde is a very faire Haven, before it lye foure little Islands, where men may goe to anchor behinde them, behinde these Islands this Haven hath two bayes, upon the point betwixt them both standeth a great Crosse, the souther∣most baye is farre the greatest, into it commeth also a river or off water, where men doe catch Salmon. The middlemost Island (which is the northermost save one) is the greatest and highest upon which standeth a great Warder, the northermost is somewhat long and small, &amp; so low, that at high water the sea runneth up a good wayes upon it on both sides, and so maketh that Island smaller.</P>
<P>Betwixt that Island and the maine land, or the north shoare of the Havens mouth lyeth a suncken rock, which you must leave, in comming in, on the larboard side, and runne in close by the main land, this channel is so narrow, that you cannot sayle in it, except you have a large wind, at low water there remaineth no more then 9 or 13 foot water.</P>
<P>To the southwards of that great Island, lyeth another Island that is indifferent high, and the southermost of them all, betwixt that and the point of the maine land, lyeth in the souther channell, which is broad and deep enough, but when you seyle in there, you must run nearest the land, for to avoid a suncken rock which lyeth at the foresaid poynt of the maine land.</P>
<P>These channells both from the southwards and from the northwards lye in both alongst the shoares, when as that you come then within the Islands you may anchor there all over where you will, there it is broad and large, and every where cleane &amp; cleare. Men doe anchor com∣monly under the greatest Island thwart of the great Warder, and also behinde the norhermost Island in five, foure or three fathom there it is very easy lying but with a southeast winde, the sea commeth a little rowling in, but there can goe no great sea.</P>
<P>Farre within the southermost bay, almost before the river, lyeth a rock, but above water. Without the greatest and the southermost Island, lyeth a little Island, or great rock, somewhat round, you may sayle out and in betwixt the southermost and the greatest Island, alongst to the n. wards of that little round Island, that is you must leave the southermost Island with the outermost little round Island both on the starboard side, and the greatest Island with the Warder on the larboard side, when you sayle out, this is a very narrow channell, but very cleane and cleare, so that there is nothing to bee avoyded, but onely a little suncken rock, which lyeth at the north end of the outermost little round Island, and falleth dry at low water, neverthelesse it is not good to use it, except it were for need that you could not doe better.</P>
<P>He that is bound into this haven, must run close alongst by the shoare for to get sight of the foresayd Islands, for by reason that the inner land is high, the Islands lye so under the land, that men can hardly see them, when they bee any thing farr off from the shoare.</P>
<P>A halfe league to the southwards of Rinde is another great Bay, or haven, before it lye two little high Islands upon the northermost standeth a great crosse, you may sayle in there about on both sides off these little Islands, and also through betwixt them, and anchor where you will in fifteene, twelve, eight, or five fathom, deep or shoale, according as you saile farre in lye &amp; there sheltred for all windes, but when the winde is hard out of the sea, thwart upon the shoare, there will come in somewhat a rowling sea, but there can goe no great sea that can hurt you. A little to the northwards of this haven lyeth a low long Island close to the shoare, whereby you may also know this coast, you may sayle through betwixt this foresayd Island &amp; the maine land without any danger.</P>
<P>From this haven to the Seven Islands are foure great leagues. A little to the northwards of the end of the seven Islands, lyeth a faire great sand-bay, where is also good anchoring for southerly and southeast windes, but not for easterly winds, with a northeast or sea wind, it is bad lying there for there is no shelter for them, men doe anchor there in twenty, fifteene or twelve fathom, according as they lye far or neare to the shoare. The Ruffes call this Bay the Golden Bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Golden Bay.</NOTE> because the strand is of red sand.</P>
<P>On all these foresayd coasts a southwest &amp; northeast
<PB N="73" REF="105"/> moone maketh high water, like as on the former.</P>
<P>The seven Islands<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Islands.</NOTE> lye all of them alongst the shoare, the first or northermost is farre the greatest of all, a high Island. The foure northermost follow close one to the other, and lye about an English mile, or a shot of a cast peece, a little more or lesse off the land, so that men may sayle there through betwixt. The fifth is a little round Island, and lyeth nearer to the land, there you cannot runne through within it, which is fast to the land with a shoale of rocks, whereof some lye above, and some under water. The two southermost lye a good wayes to the southwards of the fifth: betwixt them &amp; the mayne land you may alse sayle through, you may also runne through in &amp; out betwixt these same Islands every where, except betwixt the second and third off from the northwards betwixt them both it is fowle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Island.</NOTE>Betwixt these Seven Islands and the mayne land, goeth a strong tyde, as well of flood, as of ebbe, whereof men must be very carefull.</P>
<P>Betwixt the northermost and the mayne land is a good road (thwart of the south end of the Island) under the maine land, there is a faire sand-bay, with an off-water, where is much Salmon to be caught, but it is not there used.</P>
<P>A little to the northwards of this Sand-bay lyeth a little Island betwixt the great Island and the coast, men doe anchor to the southwards of that little Island, thwart of the sand-bay in seven, six, five, or foure fathom, so shoale as they will, there is a very even sand-ground, rising so even as if it were planed.</P>
<P>Over against the foresayd bay men may make road under the south poynt of the Island, thwart of a little bay, there they bring a hawser on land, and an anchor to sea∣wards in nine-tenne fathom, there they lye some∣what more out off the tyde then in the bay over against it.</P>
<P>Betwixt this great Island and the coast is about two third parts of the channell towards the mayne land, flat rising ground, and the other third part towards the Island Deep; the neerer the Island the deeper unto 18 and 19 fathom.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt that foresayd little round Island, and the north poynt of the gratest Island, stand on the mayne land some little Lappish houses, or a little village.</P>
<P>Betwixt the second and third Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second &amp; third Island</NOTE> or nearest thwart of the second, to tell from the northwards, lyeth yet a little village, thwart of it is a bay where men may an∣chor in tenne or twelve fathom all cleane sand-ground, but with a south wind there commeth in a rowling Sea, but with northerly winds it is very good lying there.</P>
<P>Thwart of the fourth Island<NOTE PLACE="marg">The 4 Island.</NOTE> on the mayne land, is also a sand-bay, where is also good road in seven or eight fa∣thom for a northwest or north wind, but with an east winde it is there bad lying, that bloweth there in open through betwixt the fourth and fifth Island.</P>
<P>Even at the end of the seven Islands is a great In∣draught, or bay, which the Russes call the Shipper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ship∣per.</NOTE> which is narrow at the comming in, but within indifferent large &amp; wide: within it is good road in twelve, eight &amp; foure fathom clean rising ground, but with a northeast wind it is bad lying there, that bloweth there flat in.</P>
<P>About nine leagues to the southwards of the Seven Islands, lyeth a poynt called Siornenos; that is to say; Blackpoynt, it is so called, because it is very black to see to, there within it the land is high, and goeth downwards low towards this poynt, almost as Swetenoes.</P>
<P>At this poynt the land beginneth to alter informe to the northwards of it the coast is altogether high, but to the southwards of it all low and even land, so that there∣by you may know (when you sayle alongst this coast) whether you be to the northward or to the southwards of this black point.</P>
<P>A little to the northward off this poynt lyeth a high and great Island a halfe league long, which the Russes call Noock Ostrove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Noock Ostrove.</NOTE> which is the Nayle Island, behinde it is very good roade, you must run in there from the southwards; from the northwards, you cannot come in there behind it.</P>

<HEAD>The fifth Demonstration, In which are set forth The Sea-Coastes of the Mouth of the White Sea.</HEAD>
<P>THe Islands of Swetenoes or Jockena, there are six in number, whereof the five lye alongst the shoare about the space of two leagues, the sixth lyeth within the other, thwart of the south∣ermost of the five. The three northermost lye one by the other, as also the 2 southermost parted asunder from the other three the northermost off all these Islands of Jockena<NOTE PLACE="marg">Islands of Sweete∣noes Jockena.</NOTE> lyeth from the poynt of Swetenoes due west three leagues, behinde it is good roade thwart of the south end in five or six fathom. The poynt of Swetenoes is a flat poynt lying out, to the westwards of it, at the end of those foresayd Islands, goeth in the river of Joc∣kena, where is a great Salmon-fishing. When you are by Swetenoes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swetenoes</NOTE> you can see little perfectenesse of these Islands, because the mayne land is much higher then the Islands.</P>
<P>He that commeth from the northwards, and is bound in to Jockena,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into the River off Jockena.</NOTE> must runne close alongst by the shoare, for to get sight of these Islands. Through foure severall wayes you may sayle through these Islands into the river of Jockena: First comming from the northwards, you may sayle alongst by the shoare, through betwixt the shoare and the Islands, (which you leave then all on the larboard side) into the river.</P>
<P>The second passe lyeth in through betwixt the three northermost, and the two southermost Islands, that is broad, wide and deepe, and also the best channell off all, it lyeth southwest, and southwest and by west from the poynt of Swetenoes, and lyeth in most south, when you saile in there, you must runne nearest the southermost Island, because of a suncken rock which lyeth in this channell somewhat off from the third Island, at high wa∣ter you may run over it, but not at low water.</P>
<P>Being come within these Islands, you shall see the sixth Island, which lyeth within the two southermost, you must run about by it, leaving it on the larboard side; When as you are then a little past that innermost Island; you come against the high poynt, and sayle in alongst amidst the channell, betwixt both lands, there it is shoale water, to wit, five, foure, three, to two fathom and a halfe, but you may sayle in amidst the channell without feare, all alongst unto the Lappish-houses, where the Salmon-fishing is, and anchor there also in the mid∣dest of the river, thereabouts lye some suncken rocks, which at low water are uncovered, whereof you must take heed.</P>
<P>For to have the right knowledge of this channell, you must looke out for the high poynt, which lyeth at the west poynt of the river, within the Islands, when that is behinde the fourth Island (to reckon off from the northwards) and the poynt of Swetenoes is northeast, and northeast and by east from you, then you are right open before the foresayd channell.</P>
<P>Betwixt the two southermost Islands goeth also an in∣different wide channell through, where men can sayle in, and so come on against the innermost Island, which you may sayle about on both sides.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Islands and the mayne land you may also sayle through, but that is a very narrow channell, men sayle through it, as if they sayled in alongst a ditch be∣twixt two Dykes.</P>
<P>For need, or if it were in extremity, you might also sayle through at high water betwixt the northermost Island, and the second, and likewise also betwixt the se∣cond and the third, but if you can by any means doe bet∣ter, it is not good to doe it.</P>

<P>Men may anchor at divers places within these Islands. Betwixt the two southermost Islands, and the innermost Island, you may have roade, where you may lye sheltred for all winds, and safe from Ice-drifts out of the sea. With∣in the innermost Island you must also anchor over against it somewhat further in against the steepe poynt. At the rivers mouth, on the west shoare is a bay where you may sayle in, and anchor so neare to the shoare as you will, in six, five, foure and three fathom soft sticking ground, there you lye safe from Ice-drifts. You may also anchor on the east side, right before the steepe poynt, but there you lye not safe for ice that commeth out of the river. The tyde here alongst these Islands, agreeth neere with the tyde of Swetenoes, it floweth with Spring tydes neare two fathom and a halfe up and downe.</P>
<P>Behind the poynt of Swetenoes you may run into the bay, and anchor there for a north, northeast and east winde, there is cleane ground.</P>
<P>From Swetenoes to Lombascho,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lomba∣scho.</NOTE> the coast lyeth south∣southeast thirteene leagues. Under Lombascho men may also goe to anchor, but it is not there very good lying, especially with great shippes; the ground there is not cleane, and when the wind is out of the Sea, commeth in there rowling very much. The lying of this road standeth drawne out at large in the Card, with the depths set downe as it is at high water and neepe tydes: the water falleth and floweth there at least two fathom up and downe, &amp; at Spring-tydes little lesse then three fathom, or two fa∣thom and an halfe.</P>
<P>Within the poynt, or in the bight of Lombascho you may not anchor, there remaineth not above three foot water, and the ground is stony and foule.</P>
<P>To the northwards of Lombascho lye five Islands lying alongst the coast allmost halfe wayes to Swetenoes.</P>
<P>Three leagues to the southwards of Lombascho, lyeth a black steep poynt, untill that the coast lyeth of from Lombascho also southsoutheast, but from that poynt to Orlogenes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orlogenes</NOTE> the course is south 9 leagues, betwixt them there is no place where men may anchor, but all alongst a whole coast, cleane and steepe.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Orlogenes lyeth off a stone-riffe a shot off a cast peece into Sea, which falleth dry a great wayes at low water, whereof men must take very good heed.</P>
<P>From Orlogenes to the river Ponnoye, it is six leagues: betwixt them lye the three Islands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Islands.</NOTE> First from Orlogenes to the two first Islands, the course is south three leagues, &amp; from thence to Ponnoye southwest &amp; by south 3 leag.</P>
<P>A halfe league to the northwards off Ponnoye lyeth the third of the three Islands, so that the two and the third lye about two leagues asunder.</P>
<P>These Islands are much lower then the maine land, so that they can hardly be seene or not at all, except you be by the shoare, thwart of them you may come neere the shoare in seven fathom without danger.</P>
<P>Thwart of these three Islands, and Ponnoy, the mouth off the white sea is at the narrowest.</P>
<P>About foure leagues thwart off to seawards from the three Islands in the middest of the mouth lyeth a shoale, which is very uneven and stony, and at some places with low water commeth dry above water, it lyeth south and north, first north alongst the coast, at last north and by west untill thwart of Lombascho, but there alongst it is deepe enough, fifteen and sixteen fathom. About south∣east from Ponnoy it is at the shoalest seven fathom deep. You may also saile alongst to the eastwards of this shoale into the white Sea, but there it is shoale water, uneven &amp; very shoale. The right fareway is alongst to the westwards of it, and five and twenty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Ponnoy is a River where at low water remaineth no more then ten foot water, it floweth there with a spring-tyde three fathom up and downe, and with an ordinary tyde 15 foot.</P>
<P>From the three Islands to the Island Sousnowits, which men doe call the crosse Island, the course is southwest &amp; by south, or as some doe hold southwest ten leagues, or from Ponnoy nine leagues. All alongst this coast men may anchor every where in eight or nine fathom, and with contrary winds stop the tydes, there goe strong tydes especially in the spring of the yeare withan Ebb.</P>
<P>Between the three Islands and the crosse Island lyeth a poynt, upon which stand also three crosses, one by the other, which men doe mistake oftentimes for the crosse Island, but it is much smaller to see to. When you doe get sight of that poynt, there sheweth by it, as if there lay a shippe before the land with the topmast-stricke. The right crosse Island hath upon the north end two Crosses, and upon the South end three, by all these markes they are easy to bee knowne one from the other.</P>
<P>Behind the Crosse Island you may have road in 6 or 7 fathom, you may sayl in behind it, as well from the north∣wards as from the southwards, it is there cleane and cleare every where, men doe anchor, when as the great crosse doth stand from them e.n.e. there is the right road.</P>
<P>Southeast and by south from the three Islands, and Ponnoy on the Russe side, there goeth in the Meseens golfe, into which commeth a great River, where men may go up to Kilda, and Kolmogro, and also another, upon which the town Slowoda lyeth.</P>
<P>Southeast from Ponnoy lyeth a little Island in the mouth of the Meseens golf, where you may have road under for westerly and southwest winds.</P>
<P>The south poynt of this golf is a low sand-strand, all grown with trees, there you may also anchor alongst by the shoare, but close by the land; if you lye somewhat of from the shoare in 9 fathom, there the ground is foule, from thence alongst the shoare to the Blew point, it is al faire strand ground.</P>
<P>From the Crosse Island, to the blew or Gray point, the course is southwest twenty leagues. In this fareway in the mouth of the White-sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Current in the mouth of the white sea.</NOTE> there goe sometimes very strong currents, especially in the spring, through the terrible great freshuts, of the melting of the snow, which falleth from both sides into the White-sea, and runneth through this strait into the sea, with graet whirling &amp; ter∣rible riplings: It happeneth sometimes that the current runneth there so terrible strong, to the w. wards into the sea, that with a reasonable gale &amp; full sayls, men can doe no more but stem the tide, where of men must be mindfull.</P>
<P>Under the Gray poynt<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gray-poynt.</NOTE> men may anchor on the south side in tenne, eight, or seven fathom, there it is good lying for easterly windes, a northeast winde commeth from the poynt the ground is there reasonable good, but not the cleanest.</P>
<P>From the Gray poynt eastwards to the Meseens Golf the coast is all faire sand-strand, with some bancks of 2 fathom and an halfe, and three fathom alongst the shoare, not farre without the land, where sometimes the current falleth over with great riplings.</P>
<P>From the blew poynt to the river of Arch-Angell, the course is south and by west fourteen leagues. When as you sayle so towards the rivers, you shall then first espy the land a good wayes to the westwards of S. Nicholas, it arriseth in a long strake, and then there riseth more land towards the River, as if it were a round Island, afterwards you shall see the steeple of S. Nicholas, when that standeth south and by west &amp; southsouthwest from you, then you are open before the mouth of the river of Arch-Angell.</P>
<P>The cape of Candenoes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cande∣noes.</NOTE> and Orlogenes lye northeast &amp; southwest 7 and sixty leagues asunder. The point off Candenoes is very easy to bee knowne, there stand five great crosses upon it for markes. When as you fall with it, you may very well perceive, that the land falleth away, on the one side to the southwest, towards the White sea, and southeast on the other side.</P>
<P>About thirteen leagues to the eastwards of the cape de Candenoes lyeth an Island, called Morsonowits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morsono∣wits.</NOTE> to the eastwards of it goeth a great Baye into the land, but it is very shoale water, with many shoales and Dwale-grounds. It hath heretofore happened, that some
<PB N="76" REF="109"/> ships have beene here lost, thinking that they runne into the mouth of the White Sea, for it a greeth very neare with the course, and also with the height of the White Sea, but it is easy to bee know by the land, and to discerne one from the other, for the Russe coast to the eastwards of Candenoes is altogether a land with Sand-hills, and a flat strand, but the coast of Lapland is high and hilly. In this Bay goeth a River through the land, where you can come through with Lodges into the White Sea.</P>
<P>Thwart off this Baye, about sixe and twenty leagues east, and east and by south from Candenoes lyeth the Island off Calgoya,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calgoya.</NOTE> being thirteene leagues long, you may sayle round about it, but upon the south side runneth a great riffe alongst the land: they that come from the eastwards must avoyd it, for it is fast to the west end off the Island. Upon this Island are great store of Geese, which in the Sommer are altogether bare, or naked, without any feathers, which sit &amp; broad upon one egge, which they have lying under them, &amp; so doe hatch their young one which are there in such aboundance, that the Russes doe come there a shoare with their Lodges, &amp; lay a deele or boarde upon the land, and drive the Geese with staves, into their boats or Lodges, in such aboundance, that they salt them into Barrels, in great aboundance.</P>
<P>From Candenoes to the Island Tussara,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tussara.</NOTE> it is eastsouth∣east two and forty leagues betwixt them both goeth in the foresayd Baye. By west Tussera lyeth the point off Swelgenoes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swelge∣noes.</NOTE></P>
<P>From Tussara to the River of Colcova,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colcova.</NOTE> the course is east seven leagues, which is a good River, being twelve foot deepe, but there is no other trade, but that the Russes doe come there from Colmogro and S. Nicholas with Lodges, for to trade there, &amp; to barter their wares there for Skins and other wares.</P>
<P>Seven leagues to the eastwards off the River of Col∣cova, lyeth the River off Pitsana,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pitsana.</NOTE> there is but six foot water, and is an unknowne place, but a little to the west∣wards of it lyeth a shoale, which you must avoyd: Oliver Bruneel in his voyage from Nova Zembla come on ground there.</P>
<P>About thirteene leagues to the eastwards of Pitsana lyeth the river off Pitsora,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pitsora.</NOTE> which lyeth in southsoutheast by the east point, and hath twelve foot water the land is there low with Sand-hills, &amp; upon the west side standeth a Pack-house with some crosses. When you come within the River, you must edge up westwards towards the Pack-house, and anchor there in three or foure fathom, there is a great Haff, or broad water. You must avoyd the east side off the River, which is full of Sands &amp; bancks. The little towne of Pitsora lyeth about five and thirty leagues within the land, there is great aboundance of costly Skinnes and Christall.</P>
<P>Betwixt Pitsora and Waygats lyeth Oltgyn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oltgyn.</NOTE> &amp; without the Land lye two rocks or little Islands, the one called Orangien, and the other Grave Maurice, you may anchor under them in six or seven fathom. From the southermost shooteth off a little riffe, but you may sound it wel in three fathom.</P>
<P>To the eastwards and to the westwards of these two little Islands is a great Bay, where it is shoale water, the land runneth there round to the point of Pitsora, all alongst in a Bay off from Pitsora unto the Waygats. It is from Pitsora to Waygats northeast and by east 38 or 40 leagues.</P>
<P>Waygats,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aygats.</NOTE> which is also called the Straite of Nassaw is Straite where, men may sayle through into the Tartarish Sea, it lyeth in first about e. afterwards northeast through about eight or nine leagues, about halfe wayes through lyeth an Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> which you may sayle about on both sides.

Nicholas, when that standeth south and by west and southsouthwest from you, then you are open before the mouth of the River of Arch-Angell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into the River of Arch-An∣gel.</NOTE>If you wil sayle in there, then bring the steeple of S. Ni∣cholas a shippes length and a halfe, or two shippes lengths to the eastwards of the Crosse sand-hill, keepe them so standing and sayle right with them, untill that the wood within come midwayes in the middlemost Podessemske, goe on the southwest and by south, &amp; southwest, for to saile a weather of the taile or shoale, which shooteth off from the east shoare, when as then the wood within (that is the wood upon the northeast poynt of the River) commeth to the souther∣most of the two woods, which stand upon the middle∣most Island or the Poedessemske, then you are in the mouth of the channell, right upon the shoalest of the Barre, the markes of the east tayle are, when the wood commeth halfe wayes betwixt the southermost and the middlemost Podessemske, when the poynt of the south∣ermost Podessemske is southsoutheast somewhat south∣erly from you, then you are without the poynt of the west grounds. If you bring that poynt more easterly from you, you can take no hurt of that poynt. When you are entred the channell, then goe, as is beforesayd, south∣west and by south, and southwest, untill that the steeple of S. Nicholas come a shipps length by west the Crosse sand-hill, then further take the sounding of the west shoare, and runne in by it, towards the foot strand, and alongst close by it, without going off from it, untill that you come thwart of the white place, or spot, on the west shoare, about the place where it standeth marked in the Card with A. Edge over then from thence east and by south, and eastsoutheast right to the poynt of the Wood on the east shoare, and on southeast in alongst by the east land, close alongst by the shoare, but thwart of the two Islands which lye on the starboard side, it is a good wayes alongst the east shoare somewhat foule &amp; shoale, where of you must take heed: but go all alongst by the east shoare, untill that you come by the first River on the larboard side, edge then over again to the west shoare alongst southsouthwest, untill you come to the bight, there it is shoale water on the east side.</P>
<P>When you are come in the bight, then goe on east∣southeast, &amp; afterwards east &amp; by south towards the Stonereach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stone∣reach.</NOTE> sail through there amidst the channell, alongst by the buyes, which lye in the middest of the deepe, it is on both sides of the buyes uneven and rugged.</P>
<P>When as you come against the Stonereach there stan∣deth a Fishers house upon the west shoare, by the little River that runneth into the land, at the north end, or west end of the Stonereach, thwart of that fore∣sayd house lyeth a great stone under water, which you may sayle about on both sides, it lyeth about the middest of the fareway, as you come sayling on, men saile com∣monly about to the westwards of it, all alongst by the west shoare, like as also through the Stonereach, for the west side is deepe enough, &amp; at some places somewhat soft ground, but the east shoare is full of rocks.</P>
<P>When as you are past the buyes, then you must keepe off againe, somewhat from the shoare. There was wont to lye a little Island at the end of the Stonereach, but that is of late yeares altogether scowred away with the Ice. When as you are now through the Stonereach, the course is first southeast &amp; afterwards southeast &amp; by south untill you come in the bight, then goe on east∣s.e. and keepe yet to the west shoare, untill that you see the towne of Arch-Angel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arch-Angel.</NOTE> then sayle right towards it, but avoid the point on the larboard side, for it is foule.</P>
<P>For to goe from Arch-Angell further up the River to

<P>For to sayle out of the River<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail out of the River.</NOTE> of Arch-Angell, then runne out by the foot-strand, and keepe the sounding of the west shoare. When as you beginne to see the steeple of S. Nicholas, then bring it a ships length to the second or middlemost Podessemske, there lyeth a black Hommock upon the strand. The north side of the wood within commeth then over that Hommock, then goe on northeast and by north, and northnortheast, towards the Podessemskes. When as then the wood within com∣meth to the north side of the southermost of the two woods, upon the middlemost Podessemske, then you are upon the shoalest of the Barre, but when the poynt of the southermost Podessemske is southsoutheast some∣what southerly from you, then you are at the end of all the shoales, and may goe your Course through the sea, where you please, no shoales shall hinder you.</P>
<P>From the Barre of Podessemske, or from the River of Archangell to the roade of S. Nicholas<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Nicho∣las.</NOTE> it is foure leagues. There standeth a Beacon at the end of the Island, where the English house standeth upon, by west that beakon is the roade for the English shippes, in sixe or seven fa∣thom, according as they lye neare or far from the shoare. The English River<NOTE PLACE="marg">English River.</NOTE> lyeth in there eastnortheast, &amp; n.e. &amp; by east, alongst by the Cloyster of S. Nicholas, but that is so shoale a river that no ships can goe into it, men must lade them without with Lodges.</P>
<P>About southwest and west and by west from the bar∣re of the river of Arch-Angell lyeth the Salt Island, upon it standeth a Cloyster, &amp; is fast to the main land. This land lyeth off from thence to the Cape de Onega, west and by north.</P>
<P>From the Crosse-Island to Warsiga, the course is west southwest, and west and by south about foure and twen∣ty leagues. Warsiga<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warsiga.</NOTE> is a village, lying on a river, where is a Salmon-fishing, which lyeth into the northwards within the land, you cannot come into the River with shippes, there is no more then eight or nine foot water, but must stay without in the Roade before the River, there is cleane sand-ground, without any fowle ground, so that you may anchor there without danger, so neare or farre from the shoare, as you will.</P>
<P>This River men doe know (when they sayle alongst the coast) by three high Hommocks, which are higher then all the other, and almost of fashion like the three hills by Bayonne in Galicia, to the northwards of it are white sand-hills with trees upon them. Even by west the three foresayd hommocks goeth in the river.</P>
<P>For to saile from Warsiga to Ombay, the course is alongst by the coasts a little west, west and by north, and then westnorthwest, afterwards the most northwest, unto the poynt of Tauria<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poynt off Tauria.</NOTE> six and thirty or seven &amp; thirty leagues. About halfe wayes betwixt them, well so neare Warsiga as Tauria lyeth on the coast a high bare hill, thwart of it and to the westwards of it lye some bancks, whereof you must take heed.</P>
<P>The poynt of Tauria is a high steepe poynt full of trees, to the eastwards of this land, the poynt falleth away into a great Baye farre alongst to the eastwards. About five leagues to the eastwards of the poynt of Tauria, lyeth a rock, a good wayes from land, which is not very great, but very easy to be knowne, it sheweth a farre off, as if there sate a great Ape upon it, this rock the Russes call Tourie Babbe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tourie. Babbe.</NOTE> that is to say, Grand-Mo∣ther of the poynt.</P>
<P>Within that Rock in that foresayd Baye it is all shoale water, uneven and foule ground, where you may not anchor not have roade, but to the eastwards of the poynt Tauria you may anchor for westerly &amp; northerly winds, somewhat to the northwards of the poynt in the Bight, there it is shoale, but by the poynt it is deepe, there you must anchor close by the land.</P>
<P>By the west poynt lyeth the Island Volna Ostrove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Volna Ostrove.</NOTE> by the Dutch-men called the Reeme-Island. From the poynt Tauria to that Island, the course is northnorth∣west, two leagues.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Island and the land of Tauria lyeth also a little Island, betwixt these two Islands, you may (for need) sayle through with a shippe, but it is very narrow, at the northeast poynt of Ostrove is roade in thirty fa∣thom, then you lye with the shippe, (when she lyeth wended to the Island) in eight fathom, so very steepe and rising is the ground there.</P>
<P>From Volna, Ostrove, or the Reeme Island to the Gouba that is the salt river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt river.</NOTE> where men doe lade, lying a half league by east Ombay) the course is northnortheast three leagues which lyeth in north, and north and by east, it is not very broad but deepe, at the comming in it is in the middst foure and twenty, and five and twenty fathom, farre within, five or six fathom deepe, but there it is foule. Men doe commonly anchor a halfe league within the river, on the east side, with an anchor in the middst of the river, sixteen or eighteen fathom, and with a cable on land, there it is good lying with all winds, ex∣cept, with a southsouthwest winde, which bloweth there open in.</P>
<P>About halfe a league to the westwards of it lyeth the fresh River of Ombay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ombay.</NOTE> which is so shoale and foule, that men cannot goe in there with shipps, except they bee small, and also the Russes are not willing they should come there; for not to spoyle their Salmon-fishing, there is great store of Salmon caught, which is carried from thence with boats to the shipps in the salt river.</P>
<P>From thence the coast lyeth somewhat alongst west∣southwest and then upon northwest to Kandalax.</P>
<P>Thereabouts lye also more lade-places, where Sal∣mon is caught, as Kierickarick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kiericka∣rick.</NOTE> and Kargapoll,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kargapol</NOTE> that lyeth southwest from Ombay, on the Koreels side.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>The first Demonstration,</HI> Wherein Is shovved the passages betvveen Hitland and Yce-land; and from thence to the Straits of David, or the corner of old Green-land, novv called Staten-hoeck.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Rom hence, or out of Texel to Hit∣land is the course well enough known to (almost) all kinde of Mari∣ners. But when ye will saile from Hitland to Yce-land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hovv a man must saile from Hitland to Yce-land.</NOTE> your course must be from the South-end of Hit∣land to the South-west-corner of Yceland, leaving West-Mana Islands on your right hand: the course is west north-westward, a half stroak westerly; and east-south-east, a half stroak easterly, the matter of an hun∣dred fourscore and fifteen dutch miles.</P>
<P>Sailing from the south-west-corner of Yce-land, ye must saile northward on alongs the wall, the matter of five miles till ye come to the clift of Rcykenesse; from thence east-south-east hard underland till ye come to the haven of Hanifioert: Ye can scarcely know that there is a haven here till ye come to the end of the farewater; but sailing all alongs the wall, till ye come to a blinde Rock<NOTE PLACE="marg">A blinde Rock.</NOTE> standing in the middle of the water, and a little Island whereon there is a house, then ye can see the Bay where the road is: Ye may sail on either side of this blinde Rock, but rather on the north as south-side; and so running inwardly till ye be right opposite to the house, there ye have a good road and ancker-ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road and Anker-ground.</NOTE> of three, four or five fathoms: Here ye need fear no kinde of windes, the west and west-north-west are the worst, but without danger, because of the clifts that streatches themselves from the northwall: here ye can have good water because of a stream that flowes through be∣tween the mountains on the north-wall. The Indwellers here be of a reasonable good condition, and brings aboard fish, stockens and other commodities for a small price, they would rather have linnen as money for their wares; but above all they are most desirous of burnt-wine. Ye can have here likewise sheep, milk and flesh for other wares.</P>
<P>The matter of three miles northward from Hanifioert runs severall warmwater rivers into the sea, landwards in, those rivers are so hot that if ye should put a piece of flesh on a flesh-hook, and let it hang in the water, it is able to boil the flesh: but on the sea-shore these waters be luke∣warm, so that ye may either swimme or bath your bodies into them.</P>
<PB N="78.2" REF="117"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Straits of David.</NOTE>He that would saile from hence, to wit, from the south∣west-corner of Yce-land to Fretum Davids, he must set his course westward somewhat southerly, that he may reach to the corner of the land, the which corner ye can see when ye are the matter of six or eight miles from the land: coming thither ye can see the Yce which lieth there continually the whole year through: So that in case ye should set your course more southwardly as is above mentioned, ye should not attaine to the cape. Therefore when ye see both the land and the Yce, ye must saile along by the Yce, which shall lead you into the corner of the Straits.</P>
<P>The corner of the Strait lieth just upon sixtie grades be∣north the Line, for the Yce stretches himself according as the wall lieth: and when ye come besouth the Yce, about nine and fiftie grades and five and twentie or thirtie minutes, sometimes somewhat southly, sometimes somewhat north∣ly, so shall the Yce lie north north-westward from you, alike as the wall the Straitward in lieth, to the hight of threescore three grades, and then lieth the wall right north∣ward, till over the threescore six grades and thirtie minutes; and then ye come into the narrow of the Strait, which is about thirtie miles broad; till ye come to the hight of one and seventie grades and thirtie minutes: and then ye come in an open roome Sea lying north-west, running round northward towards the east, and from thence southward again to the above mentioned narrownesse.</P>
<P>This Sea runs northward to the hight of seventie and nine grades, where it is closed by fast land; with a great many bayes and rivers most part full of Yce, which because of the ebbing and falling of waters is driven through the nar∣rownesse of the Strait into the north-Sea, and from thence unto the coasts of Terra Nova,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terra No∣va.</NOTE> into the great-bay of S<SUP>t.</SUP> Laurence, after and on the west-side of Terra Nova.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this land on both sides of the Strait, are heathens and wilde men: and therefore are not to be trusted though they give never so many tokens of friend∣ship. Whatsoever they handle or change with you, they lay it on the oares wherewith they row their Canoe, they trust no bodie, and therefore are not to be trusted, for as aforesaid they lay their wares on their oares and so delivers it to you. When ye are resolved to goe on land, ye must be well armed, and especially with musquets, for as for swords or Sabels they care not, because they can reach you with their arrowes, or with their Slinges ere ye can come near them; but if ye happen to kill one or two of them with mus∣quet bullots, the rest should in haste flee from you to their mountains where they have their abode.</P>
<P>This land from old Green-land be north Yce-land lying southward to the cape or Staten-hoeck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Staten-hoeck.</NOTE> and from that cor∣ner all along to Fretum Davids, and all round about that inward-sea, is it altogether a fast land, and joyned to Ame∣rica, untill the north and north-east of Yce-land; yet it is the opinion of some men, (as likewise of my self) that it is joyned to Spits-bergen, and that because of the rivers which come from the north foreby Spits-bergen, which rivers ye can perceive when ye are on the highth of fourscore and three grades, and because they ebbe towards the north, it may be beleeved that there is a passage, but as yet unknown.</P>

<HEAD>THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION which Containeth the description of IOHN MAYENS ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Ohn Mayens Island lieth from Hitland north-ward, according to the common Hollands Compas; or as others say north northwest upon the half stroke: yet it is better to sail somewhat westlier as to fall a little eastly, because they must be on the west-side of the Neering, for if they fall easterly then they must needs sail about the north of the same, where they have too great calmnesse, and sometimes whirlwindes, that fall in a sudden from the mountain called the Beeren-berg, or in English called the Bears-mountain.</P>
<P>In the Spring of the year on the east-side of this Island is not so much yce as on the north-side. For the sea on the north side, (which is never above ten miles navigable) is in the Spring commonly alwayes frozen.</P>
<P>The winde blowes there commonly out of the South∣west, both harder and oftner as out of any other place.</P>
<P>In the South-bay, a south-south-east and a north-north∣west moone (according to the common compas) makes a full Sea. The floud flowes there from the south towards the north, and ebbes contrarily.</P>
<P>The first day of August (at the north-end of the aforesaid Island) did the Sun rise in the northeast with the one half of his bodie under and the other half above the Horizon: and the last day of July was he wholy under.</P>
<P>On the North-end of this Island is a very high moun∣tain commonly called the Bears-mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bears-mountain.</NOTE> the which, if ye behold it from the north, seemeth to be cloven, but if ye behold it from the east or west-side, it seemeth round, falling as it were smoothly downward, except at the northeast corner, where it stretcheth it self outward.</P>
<P>The North-corner is hillie and rough, it seemes some∣what low because of the high ground that lyeth about it: from thence the matter of half a mile southward the coast is hillie, stay and shallow, so far from the wall as a little canon can carry, is it about 20 fathoms deep: a little more southward is there a small foot-strand of stonie ground, so that upon some places ye could make shift to bring your chaloup or boat, and this stretches it self the mater of a mile in length southward.</P>
<P>In or upon this strand there are three Yce-hills<NOTE PLACE="marg">The three Yce-hils.</NOTE> high and stay, those are congealed of the snowwater which fals in the sommertime from the top of the mountain, two of them lies near to the North-end of the shore.</P>
<P>From thence further southward is the wall for the matter of a quarter of a mile, (or scarce so much) hilly and stay, as it is at the north-end, and from thence is there another shore about half a mile in length, thereon likewise can ye bring your boat.</P>
<P>From thence come we to the Southeast-corner of the Beats-mountain, which is likewise hilly and stay as the afore∣said wall, so that it is impossible to come up on it, at some places higher other some lower, oneven, it is commonly 25 or 30 fathoms high from the water, and within goeth it in some place somewhat stay upward to the Bears-mountain.</P>
<P>At this corner lie some little rocks separated from the land, whereon are a great many of severall sorts of fowls, ye can row to and about these rocks with your boat: A little about this corner there lie likewise such rocks without the wall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers rocks.</NOTE> between these rocks there is a commodious ha∣ven, with a little Sand-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sand-bay.</NOTE> where ye can easily bring up your boat whilest ye anker; there ye are freed from the sea, for it is there commonly calm water, although it storms without. Ye cannot perceive that there is a haven there till ye be within the rocks; from these rocks westward about a short mile, is the wall stay and rockie as before, yet not so high, all alongs the coast is there many sharp rocks standing as it were out of the wall: from the land off, as well by the shore as by the stay wall, the matter of a musquet-shot, or thereabout ye have water some sixtie fathoms deep.</P>
<P>When ye have passed this stay shore, then ye come to a flat ground of black sand, which is about a mile in length, about a little canon-shot from the wall, ye have six fathoms water with black sand on the ground, this strand is com∣monly called the great Hout-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Hout-bay.</NOTE> or Wood-bay, because there is sometimes found much old broken wood: hereby landwards in lies divers flat hills of black<NOTE PLACE="marg">The black hill.</NOTE> earth and few stones, here is the land at his smalest, for being on the top of this hill, and ships sailing on every side of it, ye could make them hear your voice both at once.</P>
<P>Westward from the end of this great Hout-bay, where the land lieth south-west to the south, is there another rockie wall, alike to the aforesaid, so far as a piece of ca∣non can carry, further have ye another flat, called the small Hout-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The small Hout-bay.</NOTE> with an even shore like to the first.</P>
<P>A quarter of a mile Seawards in, by the South-end of that small Hout-bay, there lieth a rock, which to look to seemeth to be a ship with topsails up:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rock like a ship vvith top∣sails.</NOTE> hereabouts is it flat water.</P>
<P>Southward from this small Hout-bay, there lie many rocks and hills in the sea, there is likewise a stay rockie wall; between this wall and the rocks is a passage that runs in sea south south-east on, called the Bears-gat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bears-gat.</NOTE> where within four fathoms ye have stonie-ground. Ships could come in to ly there, but there is no anker-ground.</P>
<P>A mile and a half southwest southerly from the aforesaid rock that seemeth like to be a ship, there lieth another rock of that same fashion, yet not so sharp above as the other, this lieth but a small canon-shot from the land: besides this there are many other little rocks (whereon are abundance of fowls) standing out in a corner: between this and the Bears-gat is the wall rough and rockie, and sometimes here and there small foot-strands whereon ye cannot come with your boat: and from thence begins the land to be higher and stonier, for from the aforesaid corner Seawards in it is rockie and stonie, and landwards in full of hills and moun∣tains; in time of need ye may bring your boat to the foot of the hills: half a mile further there lieth more such rocks, stayly descending to the water; alongs the shore, so far from land as a small piece of canon can carrie, it is com∣monly fiftie or sixtie fathoms deep.</P>
<P>The matter of three miles south and to eastward, from the south or west-corner, there lyeth a stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Stone.</NOTE> which at the undeepest hath about eleven foot of water, which stone in circuit is about so big as a man can throw a small-stone.</P>
<P>Lucas Bouwenson from Delfs-Haven hath with calm water broken the ruder of his ship there on; about this stonegoeth commonly a hollow water.</P>
<PB N="78.4" REF="118"/>
<P>The length of half a mile northeastward from this stone ye have uneven ground, for casting your sound-lead one time ye can have but seven fathoms, and at the other time ye can sound five and thirtie: from this stone towards the land fal∣leth the ground by degrees off to the depth of six and thir∣tie fathoms and deeper, yea so far from the wall as a small peece of canon can carrie ye have fourscore fathoms wa∣ter, with soft clay-ground: but about the stone the ground is stonie and sandie.</P>
<P>Claes Dirckson Seyn from Wijck wrote in the year after our redemption 1616. that about eleven or tvvelve miles south south-east from the South-corner of the Island, he found 35 or 36 fathoms, vvith black moulie sand, and small stones.</P>
<P>John Sybrantson Pael-man writes, that south-eastward from the south-east corner of the Island about two miles he found rockie ground, my neighbour had once 60, and I had but 30 fathoms, so that it is very uneven there.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a mile northwestward from the South-corner, there stands a rock high above water, with sundrie other little rocks by him, which are commonly called the seven or five rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seven or five rocks.</NOTE> when ye come from the north ye can easily passe through between them: hard by the land there lieth a Holmken<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holmken.</NOTE> a little above water.</P>
<P>From these seven or five rocks till near under the wall drieth it up from thirtie to five fathoms.</P>
<P>From the southwall north northwest a short mile the land falleth out with a corner, commonly called the Low-south-corner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lovv-south-cor∣ner.</NOTE> on the shore is it low, and there lieth the sloops that keeps watch.</P>
<P>Between the South-corner and this corner there are se∣verall infalls, with a low shore, commodious for boats to come by, in the infalls is it sandie ground, six or seven fa∣thoms deep.</P>
<P>Between this and the South-corner lye some small rocks, some above and some under water: from thence about two canon-shot is the land somewhat crooked to an infall, which is commonly called, the Bocht of Guinea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bocht of Guinea.</NOTE></P>
<P>From this aforesaid Bocht north-east northward about half a mile, come ye into the South-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">South-bay.</NOTE> a lesser Bocht as the aforesaid, there were wont to stand ten tents in this bay, for the handling of fish oil, but in one year the sea washt away three tents, thirteen chaloups, tuns and oily-vessels, per∣taining to the chamber of Amsterdam, it washt away like∣wise most of the ground whereon they stood, wherefore those from Amsterdam did delve a large peece of ground the sommer following, whereon they have set two tents.</P>
<P>Afore this Bay ye have from nine to fifteen and so forth to eighteen fathoms, with black sandie-ground, a little further off ye have five and twentie, yea thirtie fathoms, with short stonie ground; and again so far as a small piece of canon can reach ye have fourscore fathoms, and soft ground.</P>
<P>Between the Bocht of Guinea and the South-bay the wall is very stay, stonie, and rockie: when ye ly on fifteen fathoms afore this South-bay, then ye can see through be∣tween the land and the Fowlie-rock, or Vogel-klip.</P>
<P>Some two canon-shot from this Fowlie-rock<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fovvlie-rock.</NOTE> into the Bocht there lieth a small rock; and on land there is a Red-hill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Red-hill.</NOTE> in the aforesaid Bocht there lieth a chan∣nel, whereon ye may lay four or five chaloups.</P>
<P>The matter of a mile north-eastward from the South-bay, ye shall finde a little corner, then ye have a gate or entry where ye can row through from the mountains into a Kolk or depth, there ye have so much room as to lay some twentie chaloups on; and it is very convenient for the waiting on whales: this is called of Sea-men the Hoep∣stocks-Bay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hoep∣stocks-Bay.</NOTE></P>
<P>A large canon-shot from this Hoepstocks-Bay ye shall finde a corner where there are many small rocks, (which are called the Rudsen<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rud∣sen.</NOTE>) from thence to the Red-hill the wall is rockie and stonie.</P>
<P>The matter of a mile north-east northerlie from the aforesaid Rudsen, there is an outlying corner, commonly called the Walrush-gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VValrush-gate.</NOTE> without or rather at the which there lieth the Briellish-steepel, between these two the land hath a great infall, which is commonly called North-bay, and is the most convenient place of all for the hand∣ling of fish-oile.</P>
<P>A quarter of a mile from these Rudsen or small rocks towards the Bocht, there is a flat place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">North-Bay.</NOTE> which is called the Wood-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVood-bay.</NOTE> because of this flat the land lieth high, this flat is a short quarter of a mile large, between this and the Walrush-gate there lieth a great flat Channel, where∣on lie all the tents and kettles of the chambers of Hol∣land and Zeeland: this Bocht hath a flat sandie-ground, where the ships may lie at anker on fifteen or sixteen fa∣thoms water, about a canon-shot from land. In the fore-sommer the ships lie near on land within the Bay on eight or nine fathoms water.</P>
<P>From the Briellish-steepel the land lieth eastward up, and hath for a mile flat strand, which is very convenient for chaloups to keep watch: the aforesaid corner of the Walrush-gate is very high and stay towards the sea; at the end of the aforesaid mile, ye finde nothing but rockie stay land without any strand, (and which is worthie to be made mention of) a canon-shot from thence ye have a stone, on the fashion of a steepel.</P>
<P>At the end of this aforesaid land a little foreby the stee∣ple, there ye finde a little infall, which is called Mary-Mus-bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mary-Mus-bay.</NOTE> because that Mary Mus from Rotterdam, of happie memorie, was the first that ever sent a ship there to boile oil: there is a very commodious anker-ground; for about a canon-shot from land, ye have five, six, or eight fathoms water: and a far way Seawards in ye have smooth water, likewise ye have a shore fit for all kinde of commo∣dities useable for boiling of fish.</P>
<P>A little landwards in ye have a pool, whereout ye can take fish, yea, ye can bring your boat from shore into that same pool.</P>
<P>From the east-corner of Mary-Mus-bay the foot of the mountains streatches themselves in sea, very stay and high towards the west strand or shoar.</P>
<P>From the foot of these mountains, setting your course north-east northerly for the matter of a quarter of a mile, ye have a flat shoar, where aforetimes there hath stood a crosse on a grave: between those two the land hath a great infall; and hard under wall a stonie ground; the wall of it self is flat and sandie, so that a man might have occasion on severall places to boil fish.</P>

<P>BEsides this aforesaid Bay two musquet-shot from land, ye have nine fathoms depth; off-falling ground to the se∣venteenth fathom: about a musquet-shot further ye have good single sandy ground: but when ye come to have five and twentie, thirtie, or fiftie fathoms, there ye have foul sto∣nie ground, which continueth till ye come so far in Sea, that ye can see both the corners of the land: half a mile from the land yee loose the stonie-ground; and again hard under land, where ye can see the ground, is it stonie.</P>
<P>From the crosse to the next Yce-hill, is it overall flat san∣dy ground, and in some places stonie, it is about half a mile broad, and some places are fit to lay your boats on that keeps watch, but it is not convenient for ankering of ships, for deepnesse.</P>
<P>From the northwest corner towards the east ye have a sto∣nie and stay wall, a quarter of a mile in length, where ye finde a convenient little bay, whereon ye may set one kettle to boil fish in: but because a short canon-shot from thence it is well 300 fathoms deep, therefore it is inconvenient for ships to ly there.</P>
<P>From thence runs the wall, well a half mile in length, east∣wardly up; at the end whereof there is a little bay, where ye could set a kettle and lay a boat on watch, but a short canon shot from the land, is it well three hundred fathoms deep.</P>
<P>From thence to the north-corner, which is half a mile, on the shoar is it stonie, knottie and stay.</P>
<P>On the north-side of this Island the yce lyes sometimes so near, that if ye would sail from hence to Spitsbergen, ye should be forc'd to set your course fourtie, five and fourtie, yea sometimes fiftie miles, northerly about; and sometimes ye can sail right northwards from this Island wel five and fourtie or fiftie miles, to the heighth of 75 grades norther bredth, before ye can see any Yce.</P>
<P>By fair and clear weather ye can see the Bears-mountain when ye are thirtie miles from it. Now adayes there are not so many fish taken about this Island as was wont, because they run now more towards the north then they used to do.</P>

(Upon the aforesaid North-cape there are people who lives till they be seven∣ty or fourscore years old, they ne∣ver eat any bread, for they live on fish and flesh.)</P>
<P>The Indwellers of the North-cape towards Finmarken say, that that Bay never freeses, so that they get their living most by taking of fish and drying the same.</P>
<P>The Bears-Island is reasonable high, ye can row about it in the space of six hours; at the north-west corner thereof coming within three miles to it, ye can finde ground of fourtie fathoms, and how nearer the land ye come how un∣deeper it is, for within a canon shot to it ye are on 15 fa∣thoms.</P>
<P>Out of the Bears-Island ye can have refreshment of wa∣ters although it were for an hundred ships: there groweth likewise brave herbs, whereof ye can make salate, which re∣fresheth a man extraordinarily: there are also many fowls: ye finde there coals to burn, not unlike to the Scots coals.</P>
<P>At the northeast corner there lieth a little Bay, where ye can ly safe after a little Island, cornerwindes from east south∣east to west southwest blows flat into this bay, but as for other windes ye ly safe; ye can come into this bay at the south-side thereof, at the north-side it is almost fast to a great Island, except a narrow passage where ye can come hand∣somely through with a chaloup; hereabouts is no other In∣ham to run into in time of storme, but round about ye have anker-ground; yet ye must ly in open Sea, the ground is durtie, and there goeth a hollow Sea, so that it is not good to anker there in time of storm: the floud floweth common∣ly from the south-west toward the northeast: a southwest &amp; northeast moone make high water: and it floweth com∣monly four foot up and down. At the time of year ye can take good kods, and haddoks at the Bears-Island.</P>

<P>FRom the Bears-Island to Hoopen-Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hoo∣pen-Is∣land.</NOTE> the course is north-east northerly as is suspected two and thirtie miles; the Island is seven or eight miles in length, and not above three musquet-shot broad, it lieth east north-east, &amp; west southwest, at both sides, so wel at the south as the north: but on the north side alongs the whole Island ye have good anker-ground, on twentie fathoms, a great half mile from land, on the southwest end and the northeast end ye have some flat ground, where the Walrushes use to come, other∣wise it is overall stay and ragged, but on the southside it is overall stonie and rockie, and not fit for ankering, of which ye must take heed: yet ye may sail within half a mile alongs the coast without danger, but there is nothing on this Island that serveth for refreshment.</P>
<P>There hath been some who have sailed beyond the Hoo∣pen-Island east north-eastward 24 miles, but found no land, found aboundance of yce, and could reach no ground.</P>
<P>The Hoopen-Island appeareth to you as five mountains, whereof the northeast end is the highest.</P>
<P>At the northeast end of Hoopen-Island there is a valley wel a quarter of a mile in circuit, whereon resorts a great number of Walrushes, yea sometimes it lieth whole full of them: there are likewise an innumerable number of Sea-mews and other Sea fowls, they flie sometimes in such mul∣titudes, that they hinder you from the sight of the firma∣ment above your head; so that the land is wel enough to be known by the off and on flying of those fowls seeking food for their young ones.</P>
<P>From the northeast corner of Hoopen-Island to Black-point, the course is north westerly, some ten miles; but be∣fore ye come to Black-point, on the southeast side there lieth a great many small Islands; from the mast of your ship ye can tell sixtie of them, but indeed there are so many as if they were sowen, and that all alongs the coast so far as ye can see; and that towards the northeast and west north∣west, as we suspect, altogether stones and rocks.</P>
<P>When Black-point<NOTE PLACE="marg">Black-point.</NOTE> is four miles north easterly from you, you see a great Island, in comparison of the other: when ye are a large musquet-shot on the south side of this Island, ye ly on thirtie fathoms stitch-ground, it is a stay ground, for the length of a ship more Seawards in, ye have 60 fa∣thoms; within the aforesaid Islands towards land, ye can see open in Sea, where the Islands are not so close together.</P>
<P>A mile further east from the aforesaid great Island, with∣out the low Islands, there lyes a great many blindes in Sea, where ye can have no anker-ground, the Sea beats much on those blindes when it is high water, yet there is no great floud.</P>
<P>On the northeast corner of Hoopen-Island there goeth as strong a stream as there doth in Texel, the floud cometh from the south southwest and runs along the land. A south-southwest winde maketh there the highest water: on the aforesaid Island is no refreshment to begot, (so far as is yet known, but is all stonie low land: neither can ye see the aforesaid Islands from farre. But Black-point is a very high land, so that when it is fair weather ye can see it from Hoo∣pen-Island: thereabout ye have thick mists: yea sometimes for the space of five or six dayes, ye see not once the Sun, but all thick cold mist.</P>
<P>From Black-point, so lyeth the coast eastward on, north∣east up, so far as ye can see, to Wijbben Iansons water west northwest, but the whole coast along lieth full of rocks and little Islands, the floud cometh out of the south-west by the Cape on the east side of Look-out, and runs north∣eastwardly up to Wijbben Jansons water.</P>
<P>Ye can scarcely lay on by the east side of the Cape Look-out, because of the Yce that cometh from the east of Nova Sembla, and runs along the coast, (as if it were fast land) like to a bank, so that ye can scarcely come through.</P>

<P>There lyes a stonie channel on the southeast cape of Look-out Seawards in wel four miles in length, on some places when the water rages ye can see it beat on the channel, ye can sail through between this channel and the land, but with great danger.</P>
<P>From the cape Look-out to the south-end of the foreland, the course is north northwest six or seven and twenty miles; between both lyes Hoorn-zond, Klock-bay or Belzond, and Yce-zond.</P>
<P>From the cape Look-out to Hoorn-zond the course is north northwest six miles: it is betvveen both stonie and foul ground.</P>
<P>The Hoorn-zond<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hoorn-zond.</NOTE> is a wide bay, and lyes without danger of all kinde of windes: The English have their tents stan∣ding there, and comes every year to take fish.</P>
<P>Between Hoorn-zond and Klock-river (by others called Belzond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bel-zond.</NOTE>) lyes the coast northwards westerly and north northwest, all alongs the coast it is stonie and foule, and full of rocks and craigs.</P>

<P>When ye come a little about the north corner ye finde the Safe haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Safe haven.</NOTE> which lies northward up, and sailing a quar∣ter of a mile upward, ye come to a good road, which is called the Safe-haven; the ground is somewhat stay but clean, there ye may let anker fall, on thirtie fathoms, and ye ly secure from all windes.</P>
<P>Farther eastward up, the fare-water runs so far up that ne∣ver any boat yet hath been at the end of it; for it lyes most commonly the whole sommer throughfull of Yce; but if ye shun this north-wall, there is no danger ye need to fear.</P>
<P>The Yce-zond<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Yce-zond.</NOTE> is a wide river to come into, but when ye come into the Hoorn-zond or Safe haven, or get into the Yce-zond, and when ye perceive that theyce begins to come out of the south, ye must make haste to lift anker, otherwise ye should be besiedged with Yce, so that ye could not come forth, and chiefly in the after-sommer.</P>
<P>Whilest ye sail this passage upward, ye shall finde a great many Roes, of which ye can take some: and all alongs the shoar ye have such a multitude of fowls on the rocks, where they breed their Young-ones, that by their dung the rocks grow, as if it were green: there growes likewise a sort of herb, which is called Slae, and is alike to scurvie-grasse, the which herb tastes even as salate, and refreshes a man ex∣treamly.</P>
<P>From the Yce-zond to the south-corner of the Foreland, the coast lies northwest, yet ye must shun the south-corner, because it is a little foul: there lies a rock southwest from the lād off seawards in, which is a quarter of a mile long. The Foreland lies south and north from the south to the north-corner, or fowlie corner, wel fifeteen or sixteen miles in length: a mile and a half benorth the south-corner of the Foreland there lies two Islands, the one a canon shot from the other, and as far between them and the wall; on these Islands there are many thousands of fowls like to Rot∣geese, and drakes, there are likewise a great multitude of egges to be got: a great mile benorth there lies a rock of clear white stones (under which there are many great ones) this lies from the wall seawards in about a mile and a half: three miles beyond the Persh-Rif, there lies a little Island near under the shore, where likewise are many fowls and egges to begot, between both it is reasonable clean, but to∣wards the wall lyes some rocks, wherefore ye must take heed that ye come not too near to the wall.</P>
<P>About the north-corner of the Foreland, between the maine land ye can cast anker on twentie, eighteen, fifeteen, ten, and four fathoms, according as ye are far into it, but nearest the foreland.</P>

<P>On the east side of the Zevvs-kijck-uyt, in the after-som∣mer, ye have often south-west windes with great calmnesse; and in the fore-sommer northerly windes; although ye have had a good gail at sea: how farther east so much vvorse: the
<PB N="78.10" REF="121"/> floud floweth from the south toward the north all alongs the coast: it floweth wel eight hours, and ebbes in lesse then four: All the Yee that cometh with an east winde from No∣va-Sembla, cometh with a great force along the northcoast of the cape the Kijck-uyt, into the Hollandsbay; yea so hard that the ships have enough to do to shun it; this is alvvayes so when ye have often eastwindes in the fore-year; then it is driven to the west-side of the cape the Kijck-uyt, where the yee lieth and swimmeth till it be driven by the south-floud untill the coast of the Fore-land, so that all the bayes are filled therewith, from thence it runs northward on, not knowing whether.</P>
<P>From Moniers-bay to the Red-bay, the coast lieth east south-east four miles; the coast is everywhere foul and sto∣nie, hard under Moniers-bay it is a low land, yet by piece and piece climming upward to the Red-bay:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Red-bay.</NOTE> the east-cor∣ner of Moniers-bay is called the Low-corner.</P>
<P>From the Red-bay to Reene-velt, the course is east south-east five miles; the coast is not clean, yet ye get anker-ground on twenty or eighteen fathoms alongs the Reene-velt, yet ye shall finde no clean ground.</P>
<P>The Reene-velt<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reene-velt.</NOTE> is low even ground, in the middle there∣of lieth a little round-hill, which when it is from the south south-west from you, ye have all along the coast of Reene-velt anker-ground, as is aforesaid.</P>
<P>On the east-side of Reene-velt there runs a broad sail-water, called the East-wijck, at the end of which never any hath been as yet, this water runs very far landwards in, and is well three miles broad: on the east-corner of the Easter-wijck lieth the Gray-corner, &amp; lieth from Reene-velt south-eastward three miles, as is aforesaid. The Reene-velt lieth from the outmost of the Islands east south-east ten miles. From Reene-velt north-east northerly four miles lieth the Moffen-Island where are many Walrushes.</P>
<P>From the Gray-corner<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gray-cor∣ner.</NOTE> with a south-east course, ye sail to the South-easter-land on, over a bay which is four miles broad, which bay runs south, and south south-west.</P>
<P>The Easter-land runs east north-east upward, but it is yet unknown how far, it is a even lane, reasonable high, but of divers sorts of earth, alike to Spits-bergen, so that it is thought to be an Island.</P>
<P>The whole west coast of Spits-bergen is wholy high un∣even land.</P>
<P>The difference at Spits-bergen is 22 grades north-wester∣ly; when the Sun is south south-west he is at the highest there, according to the Hollands compas.</P>
<P>In the fore-sommer ye have there commonly easterly, and in the after-sommer southerly windes.</P>
<P>Likewise on the west coast of Spits-bergen in the fore-year ye have commonly east and north-east, and in the after-year most southerly windes.</P>

<P>At the west-coast of Spits-bergen the tide keeps no con∣stant course, but a floud with a north-east and south-west moone maketh the highest water; it floweth with a daily tide five and with a floud six foot.</P>
<P>A south-west and north-east moone maketh highest wa∣ter at the Bears-Island, the floud cometh commonly out of the south-west and floweth toward the south-east.</P>
<P>A south south-west and north north-east moone maketh the highest water on the north-east corner of Hoopen-Island, and it floweth there as hard as in Texel: it cometh out from the south south-west, and runs along the coast to the Cape the Kijck-uyt: the stream floweth from south-west north-eastward to Wijbbe Jansons water.</P>

The corner of Can∣denoes is well enough known; there stands 5 great crosses up for tokens, which when ye come by, ye can per∣fectly perceive that the land fails you, on the one side south-west to∣ward the White sea, and on the other side south-east.</P>
<P>About ten miles easterly from Cabo de Candenoes, there lieth an Island called Morsonowits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morsonovvits.</NOTE> from thence easterly there lieth a great Inham landward in, which is a flat undeep water, withall a deceitfull ground. There hath been divers ships who have saild amisse here, thinking that they had been in the mouth of the Whitesea, therefore it is necessarie to learn to distinguish the land, for the Russish coast eastward Candenoes is very sandie, and a flat shoar; and the coast of Lapland is high, and full of mountains. Into this Inham there runs a river from the land, through the which ye can come in boats to the White sea.</P>
<P>Besides this Inham about twentie miles east and east sou∣therly from Candenoes, there lieth an Island called Col∣goya,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colgoya.</NOTE> which is ten miles in length; ye may sail round about it, but on the south-side thereof lieth a craig which comes from the east, that ye must shun, because it joyns to the west-end of this Island. There are a great many geese on this Island, which in the sommer time are wholly naked having no kinde of feathers; they lay their egge under their stump or taile, and on that fashion breeds forth their young ones: there are such multitudes of those geese there, that the Russes comes with their Lodges or boats to land, and takes of them by multitudes, and salts them in tuns.</P>
<P>From the Candenoes to the Island Tussara<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tussara.</NOTE> the course is east south-east 32 miles, and between both lieth this great ham.

<P>Five miles eastward from the river Colcova lieth the river Pitsana,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pitsana.</NOTE> which is but six foot deep, and is not well known, a little westerly from this lieth a drie bank which ye must shun. Olivier Brunel coming from Nova Sembla sat here on ground.</P>
<P>Ten miles eastward from Pitsana lieth the river Pitsora,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pitsora.</NOTE> that runs by the east-corner in, south south-east, and is deep six Holland yards: the land there is low and sandie, on the west-corner there stands a Pack-house whereon stands some crosses; when ye come within the river, turn a little west∣ward up toward the Pack-house, and let anker fall on three or four fathoms water, there is a great poole or lake.</P>
<P>Ye must shun the east side of the river, for it is full of sand and banks. The town of Pitsora lieth 26 Dutch miles land∣ward in: there is abundance of costly skins and cristall.</P>
<P>Between Pitsora and Way-gats lieth Oltgijn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oltgijn.</NOTE> and without on the land lieth two rocks or little Islands, the one called Oranjen, and the other Graef Maurits: there ye may ly at anker on six or seven fathoms. From the south-side there comes a sandbed off-falling, where ye have but three fa∣thoms. On the east and west-side of these two Islands there is a great Inham, flat water; the land lieth there in the round to the corner of Pitsora, all in one Inham: it is from Pitsora to Way-gats north-east easterly 24 miles.</P>
<P>Way-gats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVay-gats.</NOTE> which is likewise called the Strait of Nas∣sowen, is a narrow passage through which ye can sail into the Tartarish sea.

A little within the corner on the north-side is a brave bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Traen-bay.</NOTE> into the which ye can let anker fall so deep as ye please, to wit on five, four or three fathoms, good strong ground; toward the east wall ye have the deepest water, and ye ly there safe from all windes or Yee-flouds. It hath been assayed at two severall times to finde away through this Strait, to sail be-north Tartarie to come to the rich Kingdomes of Cathy and China, and from thence to Molucquen; but all in vain, because of the great Yee that lieth there the whole year, and never melts, by reason of the constant cold.</P>

<P>From the east-side of Candenoes to the Island of Col∣goyen, the stream fals east and east southerly, as likewise along that same Island; From Colgoyen to Way-gats fals the stream east and west. Alongs Nova Sembla the streams turns about with the moone. Alongs Rusland they come from between Candenoes and Pitsora out of the west and west north-west, and so runs alongs Rusland.</P>
<P>The streams that comes to Way-gats comes from Col∣goyen and Nova Sembla, and falls with the rest east nor∣therly through the Strait of Way-gats to the river Oby, so by this means the flowing and ebbing of the streams keeps the passages of Way-gats open, so that they are of∣ten without Yce, except boards of Yce that come from other places driving. But on the east-side of Way-gats the floud comes from the north-east, and falls in the Oby and Strait of Nassow. The water flows and ebbs there, but keeps no constant course.</P>

<P>Along the whole coast from Candenoes to Way-gats, it is a flat upgoing ground, most sand and fast ground. If it be mistie weather and if ye have eight or nine fathoms water, then ye must know that ye are but three or four miles from the coast: but if ye have 30 or 35 or 40 fathoms, then ye are far enough from land: so is it likewise alongs Nova Sembla, and over the east-side of Way-gats, but when ye come into the mouth it grows flatter.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Ow men shall sayle about the riff off Fasterborn hat been here be∣fore rehearsed. The coast from Fasterborn eastwards lyeth most east and east and by north. First from Fasterborn to Elburgh<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elburgh.</NOTE> are three leagues. If you will anchor before Elburgh, then bring the Cloyster and the Church with∣in a fathom or a fathom and a half near one to the other, and sayle so right in unto the town, you may anchor by it in 4, 3 or 2 fathom and a halfe.</P>
<P>From Elburgh to Uytstede are 7 or 8 leagues. Betwixt them both about 3 leagues to the eastwards of Elburgh, and 5 leagues to the westwards of Uytstee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uytstee.</NOTE> is a poynt, off from which lyeth a shoale, come no nearer it then 8 or 9 fathom. Uytstee lyeth in a bight, and hath a high sharp steeple. If you be bound thither, then bring the steeple north from you, and then sayle in right with it towards the strand; there standeth a red tiled house to the east∣wards of the bridge, bring that house and the end of the bridge one in the other, and sayle in so, and runne to the westwardes of the bridge, anchor there in 3 fathom, or two foot lesse, there is cleane sand-ground. When you come from the west, and are past that foresayd shoale then you may boldly runne alongst by the shoare in 3 fa∣thom &amp; an half, without feare.</P>
<P>Three leagues to the eastwards of Uytstee lyeth a high poynt called Goessebeer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goesbeer.</NOTE> from thence to Sandham∣mer is a league.</P>
<P>From the point of Goessebeer runneth off a great shoale farre to seawards, and lyeth alongst the coast, unto neare Sandhammer, you may sound it in six, eight, and ten fathom, as you will. When you runne over it in tenne fathom, then lyeth the north-end of Bruntholm about east &amp; by south from you, and the poynt of Sandhammer north. Under the Sand-hammer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sand-ha∣mer.</NOTE> is good anchoring for a west, westsouthwest, westnorthwest, &amp; northwest winde, in five or sixe fathom. When you come out of the north∣east, you may runne along by this coast, with a northwest winde, in 7, 8, 9, or 12 fathom, unttill past Goesbeer, for to avoyd Brunt-holm.</P>
<P>The point of Goesbeer and the north end of Brunt∣holm lye northwest and by west and southeast &amp; by east about five leagues asunder, but Uytstee and the foresayd north end off Bruntholm lyeth westnorthwest &amp; east∣southeast 9 leagues assunder.</P>
<P>For to sayle from Falsterborne about to the north∣wards of Bruntholme you must go on east, so long untill that you have the length of Uytstee, then forth east and by north, and then you shall sayle yet neer enough to the poynt and shoale of Goesbeer, come no nearer it then seven or eight fathom. But to sayle From Fasterborn to the southwards of Brontholm, the course is east and by south somewhat southerly two and twenty or three &amp; twenty leagues, &amp; alongst the south side off Brontholme eastsoutheast.</P>
<P>The Island Brontholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bront∣holm.</NOTE> is clean round about, except on the southeast poynt, there runneth off a foule riffe, called Brewers rif, which men must avoyd. On the northeast side you may runne alongst by it upon your lead, without doing amisse, in 12 or 13 fathom, &amp; alongst the southwest side in 8 or 9 fathom.</P>
<P>Men may anchor round about Brontholm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade un∣der Bront∣holm.</NOTE> at divers places, as before Rottum, &amp; to the northwards, before the Castle, thwart of Sandwick, Suaux and Nex.</P>
<P>Before the Village, betwixt Rottum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rottum.</NOTE> &amp; the castle that standeth upon the northwest poynt, is good anchoring for an east or northeast winde, in thirteen, fourteen, and fifiteen fathom, but not verie cleane ground.</P>
<P>Thwart of the Castle it is good lying for an eastnorth∣east, east, &amp; eastsoutheast winde in 18 &amp; 20 &amp; also 14 &amp; 15 fathom, sand ground, but nearer the shoare the ground is not varie cleane, the nearer to the shoare the fouler ground.</P>
<P>Under the northwest poynt before Sandwick<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandwick</NOTE> there is good anchoring for southwest windes, and you may come neare unto that poynt. From the northwest poynt to the other poynt the shoare lyeth eastsoutheast and westnorthwest.</P>
<P>On the east side is good anchoring before Suaux and Nex: but before Nex it is not verie clean. By Nex<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nex.</NOTE> runneth off a little riffe from the shoare, which is steepe on both sides: but if you come no nearer it then in tenne fathom, you can take no hurt of it: to the northwardes of Nex
<PB N="80" REF="126"/> lyeth also a great rock. He that will anchor before Nex, let him anchor so that the flat steeple which standeth above Nex, doe stand betwixt the w. &amp; w. &amp; by s. from him, and that the north poynt bee north and by west, and the south poynt be southsouthwest from him, there it is two and twenty fathom deep, and cleane sand-ground. At many other places it is otherwise stonie &amp; rough ground, with southwest &amp; west winds you have there a weather shoare.</P>
<P>The Eertholmes lye from the north-end off Brunt∣holm east and by north &amp; west &amp; by south three leagues asunder, and from the southeast end south and north five leagues. In the Eertholms is a little Haven, but by reason that is not used it is unknowne.</P>
<P>Betwixt the north poynt of Bruntholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shoale by Brunt∣holm.</NOTE> &amp; the point of Sand-hammer, but nearest to Bruntholm lyeth a shoale of six fathom, where sometimes Fishermen doe lye to fish it is not verie great, but hard stonie ground.</P>
<P>From Sandhammer the coast lyeth northnortheast &amp; north &amp; by east two leagues to Somer-haven, this is a round bay, within it is very good anchor ground. From thence the coast lyeth about north 6 leagues unto Ahuys. From the north poynt of Brontholm to Ahuys, the course is north somewhat westerly about 13 or 14 leagues. But to Hanno north, and by east 13 or 14 leagues.</P>
<P>Ahuys lyeth upon a river, where sometimes is before the towne 10, or 11, and sometimes also no more then 4 or 5 foot water, according as the water commeth off out of the land, upon it is a great fishing, where in the sommer time are great store of good Els taken. To the eastwardes of the mouth of the River runneth off a stony flat from the shoare, and to the southwards of the river a foule stony riffe, right off from the shoare alongst by the foresayd flat, so that there lyeth in a channell betwixt the foresayd flat, and riffe, which is called the Eastergat.</P>
<P>Through this foresaid riffe lyeth in a channell untill into the Eastergat, on against the slatte, which is called the Southergat. If you will sail into this southergat, com∣ming from the southwards, then runne to the west shoare to the southwards of Ahuys, untill you come in 5 or 6 fathom, and then you shall see upon the north shoare, north and by west or somewhat more westerly from you, a cape or beacon standing a little from the strand within the land, of fashion like a mill without wings: Bring this beacon to the west side of the high Hill, which lyeth somewhat further into the Land, to witt, even in the going off the highest of the hill, keepe these markes so standing, and sail in right with them, untill that Ahuys commeth over that tree, which standeth there at the north end of the wood; or that the white Countrie-church come to the northwards of the little houses of Ahuys, then goe on northwest, or bring that foresayd white-countrie-church in a little valley, a little to the northwards of an old ruined castle, where of there standeth yet some of the walls upon the north side of the River, and sail so on, untill that Ahuys come to stand in the middest of the River, anchor there in two fathom and an halfe, or three fathom, there is the roade there can goe no sea. In this southergatt it is two fathom, two fathom and an half, and sometimes also at least 3 fathom deep.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the Eastergat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eastergat Ahuys.</NOTE> comming from the southwards keepe in sixe or seven fathom, and runne so to the north shoare, and then you runne alongst without the riffe, that lyeth off by south the rivers mouth from the west shoare untill that Ahuys doe stand right west from you, then there commeth a great tree to the wood, that standeth upon the west shoare, keepe that so standing and runne in right with it, untill that foresayd countrie-church come to that aforesaid old peece of wall, of the old ruinous castle, and then right in, as hath beene before said. Or runne in by the first markes, untill within a shot of a cast peece neer to the west shoare, &amp; then edge up to the north shoare, untill that Ahuys come in the middest of the River, and anchor there, as hath been said.</P>
<P>Hanno<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hanno.</NOTE> is a high round Island, which men may sayle round about, under it is good road for south and south∣east windes.</P>
<P>Behind Hanno runneth up a little River to Self-brough, but serveth onely for small shippes or Crayers, which go not deepe.</P>
<P>From Ahuys to the Rockes the course is east and by south twelve or thirteene leagues, betwixt them both lye divers little townes, as Fleholme and Rottenbuy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fleholm Rotten∣buy.</NOTE> where men may anchor before, in sixe, seven, and eight fathom good anchor ground: And other Havens more, but little or nothing knowne by Hollanders. Thwart of Rottenbuye lyeth a little Rocke somwhat off from the land, called Malqueren, under which men may also ride.</P>
<P>From the north poynt of Bruntholm to the Rocks the course is northeast somewhat northerly sixteen leagues, but from the poynt of Sandhammer eastnorth∣east sixteen leagues. If you runne alongst close by the north poynt of Bruntholm, you shall runne with a north waye, alongst even without the Rocks: But if you runne alongst close by the poynt of Sandhammer, and will saile from thence to the Rockes, you shall with a northeast &amp; by east waye fall with the Land even within them, or to the Westwardes of them.</P>
<P>The Rocks<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rocks</NOTE> are some little rocks together, which men may sayle round about, but can have no Roade under them; they lye 3 or 4 leagues distant from the maine land, &amp; are smaller then the Eartholms.</P>
<P>A leagues or two to the northwards of them lyeth the Vrouwen of Greene Island, by some called the Rough-Island, and also the Outlyers: It is not so brooken in it selfe as the Rocks, and also much greater, off to seawards from it, lye some rocks, to the westwards of it, it is all full of rocks, some above and some under water alongst even fast to the Land, you may saile about within the Greene-Island betwixt it and the rockes, but no man can doe it, but he must be verie well acquainted there, and then also not without great daunger. To the s. wards of it you may also finde Road at some places but you must be verie wel acquainted, &amp; also not without daunger, by reason of the multitude of suncken rocks and sharp grounds. The east side of of the Outlyers lye from the rocks northeast and by north. The south end of Oeland<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oeland.</NOTE> is a sharpe point, and lyeth from the rocks east &amp; west about ten leagues distant. Thwart of it, betwixt the mayne land and the aforesayd south poynt of Oeland, it is about four lea∣gues broad, betwixt them both goeth in the Calmer-sound.</P>
<P>For to sayle up into the Calmer sound, then goe on from the rockes, or from the Outlyers northeast, and by east and then you runne in betwixt Oeland &amp; the maine land, upon 14 fathom and sayle then northnortheast betwixt them both, a middest the channell, both the shoares are verie foule: but if you come not nearer them then in 7 fathom, you can take no hurt there.</P>
<P>From the Rocks to Calmer are sixteen leagues: About halfe wayes betwixt them, northwest from Southerorden the southermost poynt of Oeland lyeth the towne of Christianopell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christia∣nopel.</NOTE> lately built there upon a little Island by the Kings Majestie of Denmarke, and so called after his name. Thwart of it was wont to lye upon the mayne land a little towne called Overschare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Over∣schare.</NOTE> now it is one with Chri∣stianopel, thwart of it lyeth a ledge of rockes about a great English mile off from the shoare southeast into the sea, come no nearer it then in ten fathom.</P>
<P>At Christianopel is a haven on the east side, from it lyeth off a riffe towards the eastnortheast into sea; there∣fore he that will sayle in there must come in from the northwards for to avoyde this riffe.</P>
<P>To the northwardes of Christianopel towardes Cal∣mer, it is on both sides (as well on the side of the mayne land, as on the side of Oeland) all full of rocks and foule grounds, but you may sound both the shoares: in the middest betwixt both in the farewaye, it is tenne and twelve fathom deep, all soft claye ground, to the south∣wards
<PB N="81" REF="126"/> of Christianopel it is deeper, but to the north∣wards of Calmer it is by little and little shoaler.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northwards of Christianopell lyeth Bercker haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bercker-haven.</NOTE> there men doe lade oaken beams, there within it is good lying, but verie bad for to come in or out, because of the multitude of sunken rocks, and other foule grounds, which lye before it, about a half league off from the shoare to seawards.</P>
<P>About a league to the northwards of Berckerhaven lyeth Hosmes ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hosmes ground.</NOTE> which is a very bad foule ground, lying somewhat farther off from the shoare to sea-wards, then the other rocks which lye alongst the shoare, the∣reof you must take heede.</P>
<P>About a league to the southwards of Calmer, &amp; two leagues to the northwards of Hosmes ground, lyeth a poynt called Steensoe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Steensoe.</NOTE> which is a somewhat high rough and very foule poynt, a halfe league long, lying within, a halfe league neare to the towne, to the westwards of it runneth in a great bight, where is good lying also for manie shipps, but you cannot come in there, because of the manie foule grounds and dangers, except it be with a very skilfull Pilot: upon the west side, over against the poynt standeth a white house. The King of Denmarks fleet of ships laye there, in the time of the last siege of Calmer.</P>
<P>When you come so farre in, that you leese the south end of Oeland out of your sight, then you get the Castle of Calmer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle of Calmer.</NOTE> in sight, sayle towards it but shunne the shoa∣res, as hath been sayde here before. The Castle hath four great towers, when the two eastermost of the four come one in the other, then is the Castle about north∣west from you, then you come by the Grimschaer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grim∣schaer</NOTE> this is a rock easy to be knowne, upon it standeth a mast, with a Barrell upon the toppe of it, which lyeth much nearer the west shoare then Oeland, when you get it in sight, then sayle towards it. Thwart of the Grimschaer or Tonholm lyeth a sunken rock, about a cables length off from it, and a little more to the eastwards, upon it is no more then five foot water.</P>
<P>The farewaye is through, betwixt this sunken rock &amp; the Grimschaer about northeast and by north, sayle close alongst by the Grimschaer, leaving it on the larboard side, and then the foresayd sunken Rock remaineth on the starboard side of you.</P>
<P>Being a little past the foresayd sunken Rock, &amp; Grim∣schaer, you come then on against the west end of a long small rock, which lieth farr to the eastwards, towards Oeland, and lieth almost even with the water, at some places a little above water, and at some places the Sea runneth alongst over it, edge then a little up to the north∣wards, and runne about by the poynt of that rock; Being past that, you shall meet on the larboard side a low rock, from the which there shooteth off a little taile to the northwards, upon it standeth a little beacon, sayle alongst by it, and being a little past it, then shall the town lye westsouthwest from you, let your anchor fall there in five or sixe fathom, there is the right road. If you come to anchor somewhat northerly in the roade, you must be carefull to take heed of a sunken rock which lyeth not more then eleven or twelve foot under water.</P>
<P>The Marks of this sunken rock<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunken rock.</NOTE> are these: When the mills upon the Mulholm are one in the other, with the mill which standeth on the north side without the town, then you are thwart off the foresayd sunken rock; On both sides of it, as well to the northwards as the south∣wards of it, it is deep enough. It is good lying there, all∣most with all windes, but a north and by east winde is the worst, which bloweth there open in. With shipps that go not deeper then sixe or seven foote, men may come to lye at the bridge before the towne.</P>
<P>You may also sayle to the westwards of the Grim∣schaer: that is, through betwixt the Grimschaer and the land, with shipps that go not deep, but he that shall doe it, must be verie well acquainted there, for there it is all full of Rocks, some above and some under water.</P>
<P>From the south end of Oeland, called Southerorden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The riff of souther∣orden.</NOTE> lyeth off a great dangerous riffe a league and an half into sea, there it is seven and eight fathom deep, when the Chappel upon Southerorden is northwest a great league from you, there it is tenne and eleven fathom deepe; you may sound about this riffe in eight or nine fathom, but it is not good to come nearer it, when you can doe other∣wise, and can passe it.</P>
<P>A halfe league to the northwards of the Towne Calmer, to wit, a little to the northwards of the road, lyeth an Island, called Skalloe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skalloe.</NOTE> which you must leave on the star∣board side, when you are bound from Calmer to the northwards: It is indifferent cleane upon the west side, but from the Sweeds side there over against it runneth off a stone riff, almost unto the Island. Upon this riffe standeth commonly a stone-beacon: it is dangerous to sayle through there, or over that shoale, for one that is not there very well acquainted: It is also Pilots water.</P>
<P>Foure leagues to the northwards of the Calmer, on the Sweeds side, lyeth an out-poynt, called Schenknes, or Skegnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skegenes.</NOTE> thwart of it lyeth a small Island, called the Baker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Baker</NOTE> betwixt this poynt and Skallo it is very uneven of depths.</P>

<P>Fasterborne shall then be northnorthwest and Steden westnorthwest from you, going on with that same north∣west and by west course, you shall then get by little and little shoaler water, to witt, sixteen and fifteen fathom, and close by Steden fourteene, thirteene, and twelve fathom. He that commeth from Witmondt or Jasmondt towards the Sound, &amp; runneth alongst four leagues with∣out Meun, runneth alongst over this foresayd banck, he that findeth himselfe by night upon it, hath a good mark for to make his reckoning there after.</P>
<P>Betwixt Brontholm and the coast Pomerland, in the fareway, when you can see Brontholm, it is 26 fathom deep, but so farre to the southwards that you can see the coast of Pomerland, there it is 7 and 8 fathom deep, but without sight of the land 12 and 13 fathom deep. Alongst all the coast of Pomerland betwixt the New-deepe and Rose-head, it is alongst by the coast 22 and 20 and also well 25 fathom deep.</P>
<P>Betwixt Colbergen and Garshead it is all a flat even strand and ground, without any bancks. In the fareway betwixt Bruntholm and Reefcoll, it is seven and twenty and eight and twenty fathom deep, but farre to the northwards of it is at least five and thirty and eight and thirty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Northwest from Reefcoll foure or five leagues from the land, lyeth a banck of nine, ten, and eleven fathom, when you come from Bruntholm, and Reefcoll com∣meth to bee southeast and by east from you, then you come against this banck, and endeth when Reefcoll is south and by east from you.</P>
<P>From this foresayd banck towards Bruntholm, it is five and twenty, thirty, and six and thirty fathom deep, soft clay ground, but towards Reefcoll it is shoaler.</P>
<P>If you cast the lead often, sayling alongst that coast, you shall finde more bankes.</P>
<P>You may boldly saile alongst this coast by night, or darke weather in eight, ten or twelve fathom off from Reefcoll untill about the Rosehead. Thwart of the Rose∣head it is farre flat, and round as riffe ground. When you come past or about Rosehead it is very deep.</P>
<P>When the Rose-head is southsouthwest from you about a league, there it is thirty fathom deepe, but very uneven and full of bancks, and the ground white grosse sand.</P>
<P>Rose-head being southeast from you, it is eight and twenty fathom deepe, with red stony ground, almost like as if it were riffe sand.</P>
<P>Rose-head being west from you, there it is sixteen fa∣thom deep, and white sand-ground.</P>

<HEAD>The second Demonstration, Where in The Sea-Coastes betweene Rygs-head and Der Winda are set forth.</HEAD>
<P>FRom the Rose-head to the Heele, the course is southeast eight or nine leagues distant. When you come neere the Heele, you are allmost ground off in thirty fathom. On the coast of the Heele close by the land, it is four and twenty and also thirty fathom deep.</P>
<P>Under the Heele<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade under the Heele.</NOTE> you may anchor in twelve; and twenty fathom close by the land, the ground there goeth off very much. If you be a little off from the land, then you are ground off, not very farre without the land you have no ground in fourty fathom. A league to the northwards off the Heele there runneth of a flat from the land, where you must take heed, when you will go to anchor under the Heele, you may anchor on both sides of the Heele, but on the innerside it is soft ground.</P>
<P>From the Heele to Danske before the Wissell, the course is south and by west 5 leagues. If you will anchor before the Wissell, then anchor to the westwards of the Chests, or the Wester-head in ten or twelve fathom.</P>
<P>But for to sayle into the Wissell, or the Danske Deep<NOTE PLACE="marg">Danske Deep.</NOTE> you must look for out the two masts with barrels upon them, which standeth upon the Chests, or the Wester-head, bring one in the other, and sayle in right with them, in betwixt the Chests, but when you are within Termunde, you must chuse the easter shoare, for the West shoare is flat, when you come before Boatsams flat, you must chuse the side off the Green-shoare, and make there fast with foure hawsers or cables.</P>
<P>The Quinsbrough deepe<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quins∣brough deep.</NOTE> lyeth from the Wissell, or the Chests of Danske east and by north thirteen or four∣teen leagues. From the Rose-head east southeast south∣erly 19 or 20 leagues, and from the Heele eastsoutheast easterly 12 leagues.</P>
<P>From the Wissell to the Quinsbrough-deep &amp; al al∣ongst to the northwards of it, it is altogether a faire white sandy strand, upon both sides off the deep stand some withered trees, to see to as if they were burnt, but upon the south side stand two Capes, or beakons. If you wil sayle in there, bring the capes one in the other, when you come in 10 or 8, fathom, and sayle in so right with them, and so you shall run right with the buyes, which lye on both sides of the Deepe to 8 or 10 in number, to wit, on each side foure or five, sayle in betwixt them, untill you come within in the Kettell. There is no certainty to be written of the lying in of this channell, as also of the the Danske deep, whereunto men might trust, for by reason of the scouring of the Freshuts, and with great streaming of the Ice, they doe change oftentimes, and sometimes in short time, but the Lords of the land there have very great care to give charge, that they be alwa∣yes well set with buyes and beakons.</P>
<P>For to anchor in the road without the deep, then an∣chor so that the poynt of Locksteed lye about north and by east from you, there it is eight, nine and ten fathom deep.</P>
<P>Within the Deep in the Kettell, men do lye to tarrie for the wind in three fathom and three fathom and a halfe.</P>
<P>For to sayle up the Haff go out of the Kettel about e. untill you come against the Heert, and southeast over it and then alongst the Haff amidst the channell unto the Haverstrome, the course is most east. Being over the Heert edge somewhat to the south shoare for to avoyd that riff which lyeth off from the north shoare about a third part into the Haffe, to wit; from the point by east Fishouses there lyeth a little buye upon it, and come no neerer it then twelve or thirteene foot. The right fare∣way is to the southwardes of it fourteen and fifteen foote soft ground, untill about Brandenburgh, from thence further it is by little and little shoaler twelve, eleven and ten foot upon the Haverstraw. When you get the steeple of Quinsbrough in sight, then you shall see also by it a round black little wood; keep the steeple on the north or east side off that little wood, untill that you be past Brandenburgh, then let the steeple come a ships length to the eastwards of the little wood of trees, &amp; sayle so right with it, till you come by the buyes or little trees of the Haverstraw, there you must run through amidst the channell betwixt them, untill you come into the Pregell which lieth up northeast unto the towne.</P>
<P>From der Pillo to Quinsbrough are about eight lea∣gues, but to Melven<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melven.</NOTE> it is about 9 leagues, you must also sayle up there amidst the channell about southwest, but the poynt over against the Pillo, where the castle Terba∣ly standeth, you must avoid somewhat, which runneth far off flat.</P>
<P>Foure or five leagues north and north and by west from the Quinsbrough Deep lyeth the poynt of Bruste∣roort, and betwixt them both Loocsteed, whereupon standeth a Castle with a Church, not farre one from the other, and also two high hommocks or hills, and the land there abouts is all full of trees.</P>
<P>From Brusteroort to the Deepe off Der Memell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Der Me∣mell.</NOTE> the course is northeast and by north sixteen or seventeen leagues. It is there betwixt them both a faire strand, and the land lyeth in a great bay. The deep of Der Me∣mell lyeth in northeast, and northeast and by east, and is two fathom deep, within it you come into a great Haffe: you may runne to the westwards about the poynt, and anchor there where you will.</P>
<P>From Der Memell to Heyligena, the coast lyeth north &amp; by east four leagues.</P>
<P>From Heyligena to the poynt of Sevenbergen, north and by east, five leagues, that is with hommocks and hil∣ly land.</P>
<P>Foure or five leagues north and by east from Seven∣bergen lyeth Terlyba.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terlyba.</NOTE> There goeth into the land a little river, but there can go in no shippes, there is no more then six foot water. On the north side of the river stand∣eth a Gentlemans house or Castle, with a turret upon the midst of it, the north end of the house is covered with boards, and the southend with red tyles, to the south∣wards or the eastwards of it stand also some houses, co∣vered also with tyles, in betwixt two woods to see to. If you will anchor in the road of Terlyba, then anchor a little to the southwards of the village so that the fore∣said Gentlemans-house with the turret doe stand east and by north from you in foure fathom and a half, and five fathom lesse two foot, there is the best road and ground that is thereabouts. When you come out of the sea, and fall with the land to the eastwards or to the northwards of Terlyba, you shall see within the land a black wood, and the houses in a ragged valley of Sand∣hills.</P>
<P>From Terlyba to Derwinda, the course is northnorth∣east sixteen, or seventeen, leagues, betwixt them both the land lyeth in a bight, so that the coast alongst by the shoare lyeth not so right, especially four or five leagues by south Derwinda, there it falleth away into a great bight, which men do call Sackerwyke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacker∣wyke.</NOTE> and also with more smaller bights and bayes towards Terlyba.</P>
<P>About four leagues to the northwards off Terlyba lyeth a poynt called Stickeroort, or Steenoort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Steenoort</NOTE> thwart there of it is very flat, so that a good wayes from the

Anno 1599, in the Spring a man of Hoorn sayled somewhat neere to this shoale, and came on ground upon an unknowne rock, &amp; lost shis ship. To the northwards of it, towards Derwinda thwart off Sacker-wyke it is all cleane ground, and farre flat, at many places a good waves from the land not deeper then sixe and seven fathom clean sandy ground, good for to anchor in, when you lye by there with a northeast winde, and can get nothing with turning to windwards. But if you keepe under saile, you may in turn∣ing to windwards come neere the shoare every where without feare in 4 or 5 fathom.</P>
<P>For to know this coaste off Coerland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to know Coerland.</NOTE> then remember these places here under written.</P>
<P>At Derwinda standeth a Castle with three Towers, which is covered above with red tyles, and under it is white, about a league to the southwards of Derwinda, lyeth the Bakeovens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bakeovens</NOTE> which is next to Domesnes, the best land to be known of Coerland, it ariseth first when you beginne to see the land, in a white Sand-hill, the top whereof is full of trees, but when you come so neer the shoare, that you can see the other land also then there ariseth more land with hommockes, so that then it is not so easy to be known.</P>
<P>About foure leagues to the southwards of it in Sacker∣wyke lyeth yet a hommock or hill full of trees with some little hommockes to the eastwards of it, when you are thwart of Derwinda, you may even see it half wayes up to the top, but not well from below. This hommocke is called by some Duke D'alves Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke de Alves Castle.</NOTE> and lieth most alone: the land, as well to the southwards as to the northwards of it, is most al even and plain land.</P>
<P>About six leagues to the southwards of the foresayd hommock, and 5 or 4 leagues and an half to the north∣wards off Terlyba, lye also two high hommocks close one by the other, the land to the southwards of them towardes Terlyba, is to see to farre off (when you are thwart of these two hommocks, or somewhat to the northwards of them) as if it were all broken land, thwart of this about 5 leagues from the land, or when you can but even see the land from below, it is 30 fathom deep.</P>
<P>When you begin to come about Derwinda<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banck by Derwinda</NOTE> within 2 or 3 leagues off the land, there lyeth a banck of 12, 13, and 14, fathom: some say that west and by north from Derwinda there should be no more upon that banck then 5, or 6, fathom water, it is about a halfe league broad betwixt the banck and the land a league without the shoare, it is againe 20 and 24 fathom deep.</P>
<P>If you will anchor before Derwinda, then bring the foresayd Castle about eastsoutheast from you, then it commeth almost behind the high land, anchor in 5 fathom from the shoare, there is the best roade.</P>

<HEAD>The third Demonstration, Where in Are Described the Sea-Coastes betwixt Der Winda and Revel, and the Islands of Aland.</HEAD>
<P>THe lying of Derwinda, and how men shall know it, is here before declared.</P>
<P>From Derwinda to Lyserorte, the coast lyeth northeast and by north foure leagues, and from Lyserorte to Domesnes eastnortheast twelve or thirteen leagues. When you are thwart of Lyserorte, you can perceive no poynt, it seemeth to be all an even right coast from Derwinda to Domesnes, but comming from Derwinda or Domesnes, and being a league or two to the eastwards or to the westwards of it, you can see well that it is a blunt poynt, lying out. Thwart of Lyserorte run∣neth off a great uneven shoale, at least two leagues in∣to sea, but you need not feare of it, you may runne over it in four, five or six fathom by the lead, like as also alongst all the coast of Coerland from Derwinda, untill about Domesnes.</P>
<P>To the westwards of Lyserort the land hath a little bight, there you may anchor for northeast, eastnorth∣east and east winds: when it bloweth hard, &amp; that you can do no good with turning to windwards, you must bring the poynt of Lyserorte eastnortheast from you in seven fathom, there is clean sand-ground and good lying.</P>
<P>The land betwixt Domesnes and Derwinda is very easy to be known. At the poynt of Derwinda it is high, and goeth sloping down by little &amp; little to the eastwards unto Lyseroort: Likewise 3 or 4 leagues by west Domes∣nes lyeth a high blewhill, called the Doembergh, which is steep on the east side, &amp; goeth by little &amp; little sloping downe to the westwardes unto neare Lyserorte, so that there two high double blewlands do go down into a val∣ley one against the other, the low land betwixt both is Lyserorte.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leyseror∣te.</NOTE> The poynt of Domesnes it self is low sandy land, it lyeth out about 3 leagues to the eastwards of the foresayd Doembergh: but all that is together full of trees.</P>
<P>The south end of Oesel<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe off Oesel.</NOTE> lyeth from the poynt of Do∣mesnes northwest and by west about six leagues a sunder, there runneth off a great Riffe, about south and by west, and southsouthwest into sea, towardes the shoale Ly∣serorte, called Swalverorte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swalver∣orte.</NOTE> that is a dangerous riffe, at lest three leagues long, verie hard and uneven, at some places towards Oesell it lyeth drye above water, and at some other places it is two, two and an half &amp; three fa∣thom deep. To the westwards of that riffe lie also manie uneven Dwael-grounds a good wayes off from the land, which lye alongst the coast of Oesel to the northwards, which are at some places not deeper then two, three and four fathom.</P>

<P>If you will goe to Rye, and comming out of the sea doe fall with the land about Derwinda, then leave not the coast of Coerland, but runne about by it upon the lead, all along unto Domesnes in four, five, sixe or seven fa∣thom, according as you have the wind, that you may not fall without, or to the westwards of that riffe Swal∣verorte. The channell betwixt Coerland and that fore∣sayd riffe is fourteen, fifteen and sixteen fathom, but very uneven. The ground upon the shoale thwart of Lyse∣rorte is at some places also very uneven for to sound, sometimes sixe, sometimes eight and nine fathom, the one cast at least two or three fathom more or lesse then the other, and that not very farre from the land but you need not feare of it, you may bouldly runne to the shoare in four and five fathom.</P>
<P>But if (when you come out of the sea) you are past Lyserorte, and come with the land to the northwards of it against Oesell, then you have deeper water, for not far to the westwards without Swalverorte<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks to shunne Swalver∣orte.</NOTE> it is thirty fa∣thom deep. If you can see Oesel and Coerland, and that the Doembergh be eastsoutheast or southeast &amp; by east from you, then runne on southeast untill you come neare Coerland, for to avoyd Swalverorte, and then alongst by it upon your lead towards Domesnes, as is beforesayd. Or when as you have the Doembergh eastsoutheast from you, then keepe it so standing from you, and sayle in so right with it, and then you shall (without hurt) runne alongst over the taile of the outermost shoale of Swalve∣rorte, it shoaleth up there very soone and suddainly from 13 or 15 and nine fathom, but if you bringe the east side of the Doembergh not more southerly from you then eastsoutheast and southeast and by east then you shall not meet with any dangers of the Dwaelgrounds, nor of Swalverorte, you shall thus sayle alongst at least three leagues over the Dwaelgrounds and Swalverorte, over very uneven grounds, the one cast at least twelve, the other nine, and also wel seven, and sixe fathom, but goe on your course without feare, when as the Inner side, or east side of the south end of Oesel commeth to be north, and north and by east from you, then you are over the riffe, within all the foule grounds that might hurt you, when as that you get then 13 or 14 fathom, then sayle bouldly without fear towards Domesnes.</P>
<P>If it should happen, that with a northwest winde, you should fall with the land to the northwards of Derwinda or Lyserorte, &amp; should fear to come neere the Coast of Coerland, then keepe not further off to Sea, then that the east poynt of Doembergh be eastsoutheast from you, when as then you bring the east side of the south point of Oesell northnortheast from you, then you shall runne alongst over Swalverorte in seven fathom. Betwixt Oesel and Coerland it is sixteen and seventeen fathom deep. When as Domesnes is southeast and by east, and the south poynt of Oesel northwest and by north from you, and that you are a like neare to them both there it is eighteen farhom deep.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Domesnes runneth off also a riffe northeast and by north, or a little more northerly a lea∣gue and half into the sea, which is on the east side very steepe, but on the west side somewhat flatter.</P>
<P>When you come from out of the west, and are bound to Rye you may runne about by it upon your lead, in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 fathom, so neare as you will, but accord∣ing as the winde and weather shall be, I know of some that have sounded about it in foure, and foure fathom &amp; half: but he that will runne so somewhat neare about it must be very carefull in using of his lead, &amp; not let it rest.</P>
<P>Not very farre from the riffe, on the west side, it is 12 and 13 fathom deep. When as the poynt of Domes∣nes, where the withered trees stande upon come to bee southsouthwest from you, then you come on against the west side of the riffe, when that poynt is southwest and by south from you, then you are right thwart of the poynt, but when it is southwest, and southwest and by west from you, then you are about the riffe, and then you may bouldly goe on southeast towards Rye. Domesnes and the Deep of Rye lye southeast &amp; northwest twenty leagues distant.</P>
<P>About eight leagues to the eastwards or to the south∣wards of Domesnes runneth off another riffe from a poynt which you may sound about in five &amp; six fathom. The land betwixt Domesnes and that poynt lyeth about southsoutheast, and northnorthwest, but to the south∣wards of it, it falleth away to the south; so that betwixt this poynt, and the Deep of Rye, there is a great bay, which is called the Kowerwyck:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kower¦wy ke.</NOTE> somewhat to the south∣wards of this poynt in the bay, lyeth some high land, which lyeth from the Deepe of Rye w. and by s. and e. and by north. It must be very cleare weather when you can see it, lying at anchor before the deepe of Rye.</P>
<P>When as (comming from Rye) you shall be somewhat to the southwards in the Koperwike, and come running out there by the shoare, this foresayd poynt hath thus oftentimes been mistaken for Domesnes, because that then you can see no Land without it, but when as you come about the point, you shall againe see the Land out a head, then you are yet about 8 leagues from Domesnes.</P>
<P>Under the poynt of Domesnes you may anchor on both sides, as well to the westwards as to the eastwards. If you will anchor to the westwards of it, then anchor in 6, 7 or 8 fathom, there you have good sand ground, and sheltred for east and southeast winds. If you wil an∣chor to the eastwards of it, then anchor in 6 or 7 fathom, a little within the poynt of the land, so that the poynt be north or north and by west from you, there is good sandie ground, &amp; good lying for a southsouthwest west∣northwest and northnorthwest winde: the point of the riffe lyeth then from you about northnortheast a league and half. If you will anchor further from the shoare, so that the poynt of Domesnes be northwest or northwest &amp; by north from you, there it is eighteen and twentie fathom deep &amp; soft ground.</P>
<P>If that you are comming off from Rye against the riff of Domesnes, you will sail about it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der Do∣snes.</NOTE> then you must run∣ne farre enough about without it, or if you will take it somewhat near, you must be exceeding carefull in using your lead. It is (as hath bene sayd) verie steepe on the east side, with a northwest waye, (which runneth thwart into the riffe) you shall have the one cast twelve nine, or eight, and the next cast four, or three fathom, if you fall within the poynt of the riffe. But if you have been at anchor under Domesnes, and set sayle from thence and will sayle about the riffe, then you may the better runne about it by your lead. Goe from thence northnorth∣east and northeast &amp; by north, that runneth most alongst by the riffe. When the point off Nesse commeth about west from you, then it will be by little and little some∣what shoaler, you must not spare your lead, but must so∣und often. With a northwest course come not nearer it then in nine ten or twelve fathom. When the poynt of Nes commeth to be southwest from you, you may run about sound it so in five, sixe or 7 fathom, then you come to the east side of the riffe, when that is south∣west &amp; by south from you, then you are right thwart of the point of the riffe, but when it is southsouthwest from you, then you are about the riffe, go then west southwest or more southerly towardes Coerland, and runne alongst by it, in five, sixe or seven fathom (accor∣ding as the winde shall be) toward Luseroort.</P>
<P>If you sayle from Rye with an east or northeast winde, &amp; shall saile by night about the rif, then set your course so, that you be sure you run farre enough alongst to the n. wards, or without the Riffe, &amp; keepe that course untill that you come neare the grounds of Ambroock or Oesel in 15 or 16 fathom, then you shall be without doubt past the riffe, then goe on a while southwest, untill that you reckon the poynt of Domesnes to be southeast, or some∣what more easterly from you, then edge up to the coast of Coerland by your lead, and runne alongst by it, in four, five, sixe or seven fathom, as hath been beforesayd.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="135"/>
<P>East and by north somewhat easterly eight leagues from Domesnes lyeth the Island Round:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Round.</NOTE> you may runne round about it by your lead, in six or seven fathom. All alongst the southwest side it is all foule and sharp rockie ground, therefore come not nearer the shoare there, then in 6 fathom. Southsoutheast about a halfleague from the south poynt lyeth a little plate, where upon it is not deeper then six foot, there hath once a man beaten off his rudder. It lyeth betwixt seven and eight fathom deepe, for to avoyd that, take thereabouts the sounding of the shoare in five or sixe fathom, and then you run through betwixt it and the shoare, or els if you keepe in eight or nine fathom, then you runne about with∣out it.</P>
<P>If you will anchor under Round<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der Round</NOTE> for a southsouthwest, southwest or westsouthwest winde, then runne about the southeast poynt, untill you come to the east side, there is a little bay, where stand a few houses with a chappell, which you can see when you come somewhat neare to the shoare, anchor thwart of it in five fathom, so that the chappell doe stand southwest from you, there is the best road under Round, being clean sandy ground, but when it bloweth hard the sea commeth rouling in. At other places it is not very cleane.</P>
<P>The fareway betwixt Round and Domesnes is two and twenty and three and twenty fathom deepe, and betwixt Round and Duynemond three &amp; twenty &amp; four and twenty fathom.</P>
<P>From Round to the Deepe of Rye, it is southsoutheast, 15 leagues. Before the Deepe of the river Duyn you may anchor in tenne fathom, either to the southwards or the northwards of it, where you please.</P>
<P>The Deep of the river of Rye<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deep of the ri∣ver of Rye</NOTE> is Pilots water, as well in sayling up, as sayling off. How men shall sayle there in or out it is not possible to describe, so that men might relye upon it, for by reason of the continuall scowring of the stream, and especially by some extraordinarie great freshuts, and strong drifts of yce, the depths and shoales do there often shift and change, where of every one that is bound thither may be mindfull of.</P>
<P>From the Deepe of Rye to Parno, the course is north∣northeast and northeast and by north five and twenty leagues, betwixt them both, about fourteene leagues from Rye lyeth a little towne called Lemsael<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lemsael.</NOTE> or Sales, there goeth in a little deepe of eight foot water. Before that Deepe lyeth a banck, which you may sayle about on both sides, and come within it, there it is three fathom deep. The Island Kyn<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kinne.</NOTE> lyeth from Sales northwest and by west 7 leagues: from Round east and east and by north seven leagues, and from the Deepe of Rye north and by east about 14 or 15 leagues. It is a little low Island, about 2 leagues long, &amp; hath round about it most foule ground. Betwixt Kyn &amp; the coast of Lyfland it is 7 leagues broad, and the right deep betwixt them both is 8 and 9 fathom deep.</P>
<P>Northwest eight leagues from Round, and north and by east seven leagues from Domesnes lyeth Ambrook,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrook</NOTE> that is a little Island, which is round about foul, with sharpe stony ground, and lyeth two leagues distant from the coast of Oesell. Betwixt Round and Ambrook but nearest Ambrook lye many uneven Dwael-grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dwael-grounds.</NOTE> of three, four and five fathom. Ambrook and the south end off Oesell lye eastnortheast, somewhat northerly, and westsouthwest somewhat southerly about five leagues distant. Under the south poynt off Oesell<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roade un∣der Oesell</NOTE> on the east side is a good roade for westerly winds. If you will anchor there, then anchor in eight or seven fathom, so that the white Church, which standeth somewhat within the southermost poynt, doe stand west and by south from you, there is good soft clay ground, and you shall lye shel∣tred for a west &amp; westsouthwest winde. The ground is there very even &amp; slatte, when as you get the seven fathom, and sayle towards to land it continueth long all one depth of 7 fathom, untill you come very close by the shoare before it will be shoaler.</P>
<P>It is there all alongst by the east coast of Oesell flatt ground of three, four and five fathom.</P>
<P>For to sayle from the south end of Oesell unto Arents∣bergh through within Ambrooke, you must leave two thirds of the water on the larboard side towads Oesell, and one third part on the starboard side towards Am∣brooke, there you shall have about seven fathom water, and soft claye ground, towards the Coast of Oesell it is full of uneven Dwale-grounds; alongst by the west side of Ambrooke you cannot lightly take hurt.</P>
<P>Arentsbergh<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arents∣bergh.</NOTE> lyeth from the south end of Oesel north∣east distant eight leagues, but from the Island Ambrook northnorthwest four or five leagues. Upon the west side of Oesel, the coast lyeth off from the south end unto Hondsoorte, with divers bayes, about northnorthwest &amp; southsoutheast twelve leagues, betwixt them both lye two lade places, Wyke and Reeck. Alongst this west coast of Oesell lye very manie uneven and soul grounds, where of men must take very good heed.</P>
<P>Hondtsoort, the northwest poynt of Oesell, and the poynt of Dagerorte lye northnorthwest, and south∣southeast about 8 leagues distant. Betwixt them both is a great haven there runneth also a channell through, but it is so shoale that no ships can go through, and all over sharpe and uneven ground. Upon Dagerorte<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tower upon Da∣gerorte.</NOTE> standeth a high tower which the Wor. Counsell of the towne of Revell caused there to be builded, for to know the land by, which men may see on both sides of Dagerorte farre into sea, and also may see it over the land farre in the foresayd baye.</P>
<P>Under the poynt on the south side of Dagerorte is good lying for north and northeast winds and cleane sand ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you may sound about by the poynt of Dage∣rorte in seven or eight fathom, on the north side of the poynt is good road for southerly winds.</P>
<P>From Dagerorte to Syburghnes, the coast lyeth east∣northeast seven leagues. Betwixt them both, to witt, three leagues from Dagerorte, and four leagues from Syburghnes, lyeth a ground, going flat off thwart from the land northwest into sea, at least five or sixe leagues, almost in manner as the great luttish riffe, is first of three, four, five, sixe and seven fathom deep, and waxeth deeper by little and little towards the Finnish Scheers, where at last it runneth to nothing.</P>
<P>About three leagues without the land of Dagerorte, north and north and by east from the high tower, there lyeth a sunken rock which is very steep, whereupon there is no more then ten foot water: A man of Ossanen hath beaten upon it, which went no deeper then eleven foot and a half, presently after the stroke he cast the lead, and found five fathom depth. The tower of Dage∣roort was then from him south and south and by west.</P>
<P>Syburghnes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Syburgh∣nes.</NOTE> is an out poynt, with two poynts, from each of which shooteth off a riffe, betwixt these two riffes is a faire flat sand strand, where you may anchor so neere the shoare as you will, in six, five or four fathom.</P>
<P>A little to the westwards of the westermost poynt of Syburghnes, not farre from the land lieth a shoale under water, about so great as a shipp, whereupon it is not dee∣per then twelve foot.</P>
<P>From Syburghnes to Oetgensholm, the course is e. &amp; by n. 7 leag. betwixt them both goeth in the Moensound.</P>
<P>To the southwards of Oetgensholm goeth in a great bay into the land, where in lyeth an Island, and behinde it a little towne called Hap-sael, there you may anchor where you will. On the southwest side of this baye, run∣neth off a great shoale or ledge of rocks at least a great league into the sea, which is very broad, you may runne in alongst by it into Moensound.</P>
<P>Eastnortheast, and w.s.w. from the east hoeck of Oet∣gensholm a league in sea lyeth a cliff under water where∣upon in the yeare a man of Harlingen is cast. away.</P>
<P>From Syburghnes to the Oxeholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxeholm</NOTE> &amp; the Grasholm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grasholm</NOTE> the course is southsoutheast 4 or 5 leagues, the Grasholm are two little greene Islands, and the Oxeholme lyeth
<PB N="91" REF="135"/> about a league to the northwards of the Grasholm, about which you may sayle, and anchor round about, a little league northeast from the Oxholm lyeth a ground loose from the land, which you must avoyde, called the wester Grasground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gras∣ground.</NOTE> there are two shoales, which are called the Grasgrounds, the other Grasground, which is called the eastermost, lyeth over against the Grasholm, towards the riffe of Hapsael, upon which there is no more then five footwater. He that will sayle into the Moensound, must take heed thereof.</P>
<P>He that will sayle off from Oetgensholme through the Moensound<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moon∣sound.</NOTE> must goe on southsouthwest to the Grasholme, and sayl in close by it, for to avoyd the Gras∣ground, which lyeth to the eastwards over against it. From the Grasholme to the poynt off the Oesell, where the great tree standeth upon, the course is east five or six leagues. From the Grasholm towardes Oesell lye four little Islands, each about a league one from the other.</P>
<P>When as you sayle from Grasholme towardes Oesel, you must sayl alongst by these little Islands, leaving them lying about two or three cables lengths on the star∣board side, untill that you come to the land of Oesel, over against the great tree. In this fareway it is five fathom deepe.</P>
<P>When as you come sayling so alongst past the Gras∣ground, you shall meete with an Island on the larboard side, to the northwards of it goeth in the Deepe unto the Castle of Moensound<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle of Moone sound.</NOTE> in three fathom, but some∣times, it is shoaler, for there it is all full of sands. To the southwards of the same Island goeth in another Deep, which you may sayle through, untill you come to the end of Oesell, and then you leave the two little Islands by the south end of Oesell lying on the starboard side. But the right and best Deep goeth from the fore∣sayd great tree, in alongst by the land Oesell, which is three and four fathom deepe, and at last it will be six, seven &amp; eight fathom: when you sayle alongst there, you leave the foresayd two little Islands by the south end of Oesell lying on the larboard side. From the great tree to the first little Island, the course is eastsoutheast eight or nine leagues &amp; then from the first little Island to the second south east, and forth to the end of Oesell east and by south.</P>
<P>From that ende or northeast poynt of Oesell runneth off a foul riffe, a great half league into the sea, called the Paternoster<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pater∣noster.</NOTE> which you must avoyde.</P>
<P>From this northeast poynt off Oesell unto Parno, the coast of Lisland lyeth eastsoutheast and westnorth∣west.</P>
<P>When you come about that poynt, you may sayle into the sea or buye off Rye, where you will, west and by north to Arentsbergh, southw. or somewhat wester∣ly to Ambrooke south somewhat easterly to Round, southeast and by south to Kinne, or where you will, the lying of Kinne is described here before.</P>
<P>From Kinne to Magno and Serckholm all alongst unto Parno, the course is northeast and by north eight leagues. Thwart of Magno &amp; Serckhollom<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magno Sterck∣holm.</NOTE> it is betwixt Coer∣land and the Islands, five and sixe fathom deepe, and alongst Coerland altogether a faire strand.</P>
<P>Parno<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parno.</NOTE> lyeth in a great Baye, it is there in the roade three and four fathom deep. For to anchor there, you must anchor so that the steeple of Parno stand north∣northeast from you there is the best roade.</P>
<P>Oetgensholme<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oetgens∣holm.</NOTE> and Syburghnes lye east and by n. and w. &amp; by south seven leagues distant one from the other.</P>
<P>You may sayle round about Oetgensholme, and an∣chor under it, for northerly and northwest winds in sixe or seven fathom but you must beware of the Blinde as before is sayd.</P>
<P>From Oetgensholm to great Roge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Roge.</NOTE> the course is east four leagues, betwixt them both, a little to the south∣wardes of the fareway lyeth a shoale even above water, which you may sayle round about, but you may not come verie neare it, because it is stonie and rockie round about it. Great Roge is an out point with two or three white Chalck-hills, and thereby is verie easy to be knowne. Betwixt this poynt and Oetgensholm, some∣what more southerly lyeth another poynt, called little Roge<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Roge.</NOTE> betwixt it and great Roge, goeth a broade Sound into the land of sixe and seven fathom depth; but in the end it is shoale There-abouts it is all cleane ground, and good for to anchor in.</P>
<P>From great Roge to the Island Narghen, the course is east somewhat northerly five leagues.</P>
<P>When you sayl from great Roge towards Narghen, you shall finde four leagues to the eastwards of great Roge an other poynt with two white chalck spots, cal∣led Surp, betwixt it and great Roge, the land falleth away to the southwards, into a great baye. If you will saile to Revell, then sail alongst by that poynt of Surp, towards Narghen, leaving it on the larboard side off you, going on still east, untill you come to the east end of Nargen. Being there by it, then goe on eastsoutheast a league and an half, and then you shall come by the end of the riffe, which lyeth off from the Blote Karels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe off the Karels.</NOTE> come no nearer it then in sixe fathom. When as the castle of Revel commeth without the Karels, then sayl right un∣to the head of Revell<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revell.</NOTE> untill you come to the east side, let your anchor fall there, and then hawl with the fore-ship or stearne, to the head, and make you fast by foure ca∣bles, for the north and northnorthwest windes which blow there flat open in, making it a lee shoare, so that sometimes with such winds there commeth in a rowling sea.</P>
<P>East about 4 leagues from the south end of Nargen, lyeth the Island the Wolfe, which is about a league long.</P>
<P>Northnorthwest, and northwest and by north two leagues from the west end of the Island the Wolf, and northeast and northeast and by east from the north end of Nargen lyeth a rock under water, called the Revel-stone, although there be no more water upon then 3 or 4 foot, yet it is in the Summer time with faire weather, oftentimes so smooth water, that it doth not break upon it, and it is also very steep, so that you may not come neerer it by your lead then in 12 fathom. The markes for to knowe the place of this Revel-stone<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revell-stone.</NOTE> are these: When the northeast end of Nargen is southwest and southwest and by west from you, and the high steeple of Revell is a capstane barrs length, or a little more to the westwards off the west end of the Island the Wolfe, then you are right thwart of this rock. The steeple of Revel is also the right south from you. But when the steeple of Revell commeth to the Wolfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wolf</NOTE> and that you are bound to the eastwards, and you are surely past this Revell-stone, and a good wayes to the eastwards of it.</P>
<P>From the west end of the Island the Wolfe lyeth off a riff to the northwards into sea, about an English mile toward the Revell-stone, upon the end of this riffe lye five or sixe rocks a little above water. If you come away from Revell on north and by west alongst by the Wolf, then marke the poynt of Surp, when that commeth even unto the south end of the Island Nargen, then you shall also have even the length of the foresayd riffe. If you looke out then on the starboard side, and be not sayled very sarre alongst to the westwardes of the Wolf, you shall see the foresayd rockes (lying upon the end of the riffe) lye thwart from you, and then you may run to the northwards about by them in five fathom without doing amisse.</P>
<P>Betwixt Nargen and the Wolf lyeth also a stony shoale which is very broad, but much neerer Narghen then the Wolf, and lyeth from the south poynt or Narghen<NOTE PLACE="marg">shoale of Nargen.</NOTE> about northeast, and from the north poynt eastsouth∣east. Therfore if you bring the south poynt of Nargen about southwest or southwest and by south, and the foresayd north point westnorthwest from you, and that the Wolf lye then free from the mayne land, you shall not misse to fall upon this shoale.</P>
<P>You may sayle round about Nargen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nargen.</NOTE> and also anchor
<PB N="92" REF="136"/> under it for northerly and westerly winds in 10, 12, 14 &amp; 18 fathom.</P>
<P>From Nargen to the Island Wranger, the course is east, seven leagues. The lying there of you may see in the following directions.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Coast of Finland betwixt the Alands Haffe and Elsenvos.</HEAD>

<P>At the outermost rocks off Finland on the Alands Haff lye Islands, Ercke, Castelholm and Corpe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ercke Castel∣holm Corps.</NOTE> Ercke is the westermost of all, and the outermost, from thence goeth in the Corpe sound, northeast alongst thwart off Castel∣holm and Corpe. Corpe lyeth within the other Island, and from Corpe you may edge over into the Liet off Abbo, which commeth running off from Uttoy: you may alsoo sayle up into this channell about behind Lipland, and so come out into the North Bodem.</P>
<P>Uttoy is a great Island, upon it standeth a great mast with a barrell for a beakon, and lyeth from the Island Corpe east and west about nine leagues. On the west side of Uttoy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uttoy.</NOTE> goeth up the Liet of Abbo, which lyeth in first north &amp; north and by east about three or four leagues, and then you come on against a great Island. And then it lyeth in alongst that great Island northeast unto the the Sound of Abbo.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abbo.</NOTE> Abbo lyeth at the end of that fore∣sayd great Island. This Liet runneth up alongst to the eastwards through betwixt the rocks about thirteen leagues, within it lyeth a rock under water which is a Magnes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnes.</NOTE> or Load-stone, also the grounde seemeth to be there of the vertue of the Load-stone, or when you come thereabouts, the compasses doe not stand, but run and turne without any certain standing still, untill that you be at least a league past it, and then they begin to stand right againe. From thence it lyeth east and east and by south all alongst through the rocks unto the Rough Island, to the westwards of it runneth the channell of Luys into the sea, when you are thwart of it sea, you may see the land of Revel. It is there betwixt them both, to wit, betwixt the Out rockes and Nargen, or the land thereabouts ten leagues broad.</P>
<P>The Out-rocks of Luys, and the channell of Uttoy lye east &amp; west about 21 or 22 leagues distant, although it be there betwixt them both all broken land, and full of rocks, yet nevertheles there are no havens nor channels fit for ships to come into.</P>
<P>From Luys<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luys.</NOTE> alongst without the Rocks to the channell of Elsenvos, the course is east and by north 15 or 16 leagues, but Nargen or the Wolf, and channell of Elsen∣vos lye northnortheast &amp; southsouthwest about 16 or 17 leagues asunder.</P>

<P>THe Island Wranger<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wranger.</NOTE> lyeth from Nargen east distant 7 or 8 leagues, and 3 leagues east and by south from the wolf.</P>
<P>Under Wranger is on both sides good road &amp; good anchor ground, especially on the south side, where there is a Bay, there you may anchor betwixt the two poynts in ten, twelve, or fourteen fathom, according as shall be convenient, and lye sheltred for a northeast and east, and also for a northwest and west winde. You may sayle round about Wrangher, but from some poynts (as from the south poynt, and from the north poynt) lye off some little riffes, whereof you must take heed, and be carefull in using the lead when you sayle about by them.</P>
<P>About an English mile from Wrangher lyeth little Wranger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Wranger.</NOTE> a little long small Island, lying about northwest and southeast, which is rocky and foul, especially on the northeast side. From the southeast poynt runneth off also a rocky riff whereof you must take heed.</P>
<P>On the southwest side is good anchoring for northeast and east windes, anchor under it so that the southeast poynt lye about east from you, there is good lying for northeast and east windes.</P>
<P>From the northwest poynt runneth off also a little riffe,<FIGURE>
<HEAD>GREAT AND SMALL WRANGER.</HEAD>
</FIGURE> which you may sound about in foure, five or six fathom, according as your ship goeth deepe, when as you will goe to anchor there, comming from the northwards, or about to the northwards, of the Island.</P>
<P>About a great league north from the east end of Wran∣ger, and two little leagues north and by west from little Wranger lyeth a little Island, which by some is called Kuyken, but commonly is called the Kocxschaer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kocx∣schaer.</NOTE> which is a little bare rock with a Warder upon it, you may sayle round about it on both sides, it lyeth from the Wolf northeast and by east distant two great leagues.</P>
<P>From Wranger to Eckholme, the course is east and by south 14 leagues.</P>
<P>Three leagues by west the Eckholms lyeth an out∣poynt to the eastwards of it is a Bay, called the Monk∣wyke, there it is good anchoring for southwest and west winds in 8, 10, or 12, fathom. Betwixt this poynt of the Monkwyke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk∣wyke.</NOTE> and Wranger lye 3 little long Islands, lying alongst the coast of Lysland, about a halfe league from the shoare which are very foule and rocky, and almost nothing but rocks, whereof you must take heed, other∣wise the coast betwixt them both is cleane.</P>
<P>The Island Eckholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eckholm.</NOTE> is clean round about, and lyeth about northwest and southeast, it sheweth it self high at both ends and in the middest with a Valley. Under Eck∣holm is good anchoring at the northeast side for west &amp; southwest winds in 20, 22 and 25, fathom, &amp; on the south∣west side for easterly winds.</P>
<P>Five leagues to the eastwards of Eckholm lyeth the Castle Telsburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Telsburg.</NOTE> thwart of it lyeth off a shoale from the shoare, but you may sound it in 8 or 9 fathom. From then∣ce the coast lyeth alongst most east &amp; by south unto the road of the Narve about 15 leagues, it is altogether cleane without fowle ground, so that you may also sayl alongst there by night in 8 or 9 fathom without feare.</P>
<P>Northwards from this coast in the fareway betwixt Eck∣holm and the Island of Highland lye the Chalk grounds, Hosts, the little and great Tutters, all of them with very dangerous foule grounds and shoales. Eckholm &amp; High∣land lye eastnortheast and westsouthwest distant about 10 leagues.

<P>Northwards from the Hoftes lye the little Tutters, and 2 leagues to the eastwards of the little Tutters lye the great Tutters.</P>
<P>The little Tutters<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Tutters.</NOTE> are two Islands not high but round about rocky, rissy, and fowle, they lie southwest and south about three leagues from Highland.</P>
<P>The great Tutters<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greate Tutters.</NOTE> lye from the little Tutters east southeast about 2 leagues, and from Highland south also three leagues, there lyeth off from it also a great stony riffe westwards towards the little Tutters: there lyeth also betwixt the little and great Tutters a row of rockes, where of you must take heed when you will saile through betwixt them.</P>
<P>South and by east about two leagues from the great Tutters lyeth a shoale of five fathom. He that will sayle to the southwards of these foresayd Islands and shoales<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shoale.</NOTE> towards the Narve, may be mindfull thereof, it lyeth about foure leagues to the eastwards of Telsburgh: two or three leagues from the shoare.</P>
<P>Betwixt the great Tutters &amp; Highland lyeth a shoale upon which there is no more then six foot water.</P>
<P>Southeast a great halfe league from the south end off Highland lyeth another shoale of a fathom and halfe and two fathom deep.</P>
<P>To the northwards off al these foresayd rocky Islands and sowle shoales, lyeth a little Island whereupon stand∣eth a Mast for to know it by, &amp; to descerne it from the other little fowle Islands, that you may come indifferent near to it, but not too near, for it is also somewhat rocky and fowle, but not farre off, it lyeth from the little Tut∣ters west and by north and west northwest about three leagues, from the Island Highland southwest &amp; by west at least foure or five leagues, but from Wranger east somewhat southerly eighteen or nineteen leagues.</P>
<P>He that will sayle off from Wranger towards the Narve alongst to the northwardes of these foresayd grounds, and doth get sight of this little Island with the mast, may thereby the better know to direct his course but it is not wisdome to sayle through these foresayd shoales, except for them that are very well acquaited.</P>
<P>The Island Highland or Hooghland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Highland or Hoogh∣land.</NOTE> is about four leagues long, and a league broad-lying southsoutheast &amp; northnorthwest. When you come out of the west, it ariseth in three hommocks, so high to see to as Coll in the Sea reach, upon the north end and upon the east side it doth stand all full of trees. A little about the north point on the east side is a little bay thwart of a Boers hou∣se, there it is clean ground and good lying for westerly s.w. winds, somewhat to the southwards of it, not very far from the shoare, lyeth a great rock above water. At the north end is also good lying for a southeast wind. Alongst the southwest side you may also anchor every where in sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen fathom close by the land for east &amp; northeast winds.</P>
<P>From the southwest side of Highland unto the road of the Narve, the course is southeast and southeast and by south about fifteen leagues, &amp; then you run through betwixt the Highland &amp; the Tutters.</P>
<P>Likewise when as you sayle on northwest from the roade of the Narve, then you run alongst betwixt the Tutters and Highland, but you must be very carefull, and take heed off the foresayd shoales, which ly betwixt them both.</P>
<P>The land of the Narve men do know by three high hills, lying a league to the westwards, or to the south∣wards of the road, and a league further to the westwards stand some little houses upon the high land.</P>
<P>The towne of the Narve<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nar∣ve.</NOTE> lyeth upon a river about two leagues within the land. For to sayle in there men were wont to look out for a long hill, which lyeth on the south side within the rivers mouth, and at the east end goeth downe somewhat steep, with some high trees to the eastwards of it, then they brought the woodden to∣wer of the Narve to the northwards of the foresayd trees, and did run in so with it. When as the eastermost of the three foresayd hills (a league to the westwards of the rivers mouth) come over a little hommocke, which lyeth on the water side, then they were upon the barre of the rivers mouth, there was upon the shoalest ten foot water, and then they sayled up the river, that was wont (for some years) to be so, but it is possibly since that time more or lesse altered, like as it doth oftentimes happen in such rivers.</P>
<P>From the road of the Narve to the Russe-haecks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Russe-haecks.</NOTE> the course is north and by west five leagues, which lye with many rocks a good wayes off from the shoare. The point thwart of it is called the poynt of Castrum after a little town (so called) lying there.</P>
<P>From the Russe-haecks north 5 leagues lyeth a little Island, called Rette Sarre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rette-Sarre.</NOTE> from which there runneth off a rif south into sea. From this Island, to the Summers, the course is north and by west, westerly 4 or 5 leag.</P>
<P>Eastsoutheast and southeast and by east from High∣land, &amp; three leagues from the Russe-haecks lyeth another shoale, called the Slimme grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slimme-grounds.</NOTE> it lyeth long &amp; small alongst northnorthwest and southsoutheast, with hard wind you may see it break in foure or five places: when it is west from you about halfe a league, there it is two fathom deep to 3, 4, 5 and 6 fathom uneven ground, some of the rocks of it lye also above water.</P>
<P>From the Russe-haecks to the Rode-hell, the course is northeast and by north about three and twenty leagues, betwixt them both on the Russe side, runne also divers rivers into the land, but there it no trade. The land there lyeth in a great bight, it lyeth first from the Russe-haecks unto the River of Nioa, or Oreschacke eastnortheast about 22 leagues, that parteth Rusland from Finland by a great Meer or water, called the Lading.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The La∣ding.</NOTE></P>
<P>The strong castle of Noetenburgh lyeth there also upon a river which lyeth out of the Lyslands or east sea into the foresayd Lading. Further the land lyeth north∣west, about fifteene or sixteene leagues unto the Rode-hell.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>For to sayle from Revell to Wyburgh.</HEAD>
<P>From a little to the northwards of the Kocxschaer to Highland, the course is east and by north a little more easterly 23 leagues, with that course you runne alongst a little to the northwards of it. You may sayle about Highland on both sides, but alongst to the northwards of it is the right fare-way for these that are bound to Wy∣brough. A halfe league north and by west from Highland lyeth a sunken rock under water. For to avoyd it you must sayle close alongst by Highland. Further, the lying of Highland hath been described here before.</P>
<P>From Highland to the Summers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Summers.</NOTE> the course is east seven leagues. Summers is a rock or little Island al∣most like the Eartholms, it sheweth it selfe in 3 hom∣mocks. A little to the eastwards off it lye some rocks above water: you may sayle about on both sides of Sum∣mers, and also through betwixt Summers &amp; the foresayd rocks that lye to the eastwards of it: but about to the northwards of it is the right fareway, you cannot also runne alongst farre to the northwards of it, for a halfe league to the northwards of it, it is very fowle and full of little rocks, some above and some under water.</P>
<P>From the Summers to the Goeschaer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goeschaer of greate Fishers.</NOTE> the course is northeast and by north more easterly seven leagues. The Goeschaer which by some is called the great Fisher is a long &amp; broken Island of 7 rocks, therefore it is also called the Seven-rocks, it lyeth not far from the land, so that you cannot get sight of it, before that you come nearer it, it sheweth it selfe when you shall first see it, in 4 hom∣mocks, as if it were 4 little low Islands, you must leave it lying a halfe league on the larboard side, for to avoid a sunken rock which lyeth off from it southsoutheast a great shot of a cast peece. When the water is not very
<PB N="96" REF="140"/> smooth, but a little grown, you may perceive it by the breaking of the water: you may also well sayle to the northwards of this sunken rock, to wit, through betwixt the suncken rock &amp; the Goeschaer; then you must run indifferent close alongst by Goeschaer; when it is north∣west and by north from you, then you are past the fore∣sayd suncken rock, whether that you run alongst to the northwards or to the southwards of it. Northwest and by north behind the greate Fisher you may anchor in a good haven, betweene the cliffes where upon the south Corner of a cliff there standeth a warder, wherein if you lye there you are free from all Icedrifts.</P>
<P>From the Goeschaer or great Fisher to the little Fisher, the course is northeast and by east three leagues. The little Fisher is a bare round rock which lyeth not farre from the land: when you come neere it, you may know it well from the other rockes, because there lye none farre from the land alone, you may sayle about it on both sides, but alongst to the southwards of it is the right fareway. About a shot of a cast peece southeast, or south∣east and by east from this little Fisher, lyeth a black rock with the top even above water, almost like a buye upon the Flyestreame, to see to a farre off as if it where a Seales head. This rock you must leave on the starboard side, and run through betwixt it and the Fisher but there is a piece of it driven off with a strong Icedrift so that as many say there is not much feare to bee made of it.</P>
<P>Hee that must turne to windwards thereabouts, let him not come very neer this rock, for men doe hold that there lye more rockes by it under water.</P>
<P>Both the Fishers are otherwise clean round about; so that you may also finde road under them.</P>
<P>From the little Fisher to the poynt Corsnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corsnes.</NOTE> which the Lubickers doe call Kruysoort, the course is east∣northeast somewhat easterly a league. Corsnes is a poynt going off low of the maine land, not very clean, which you must leave on the larboard side. To the westwards of Corsnes lye two little Islands close to the land. Thwart of the poynt lyeth a rock allmost like a boat, you may runne about by it in foure fathom and a halfe, but not neare. On the east side of that poynt you may anchor for Westerly winds in five or sixe fathom.</P>
<P>About two leagues thwart off from Corsnes, lye very many rocks, some one fathom, some a halfe fathom, some more, and some lesse under water, you may not goe out of the fareway without great feare and danger. It is impossible to describe all the uneven grounds, the great multitude of rocks &amp; rocky shoales which are lying thereabouts.</P>
<P>From Corsnes to the Island Rodehell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rodehell.</NOTE> the course is northeast and by east about three leagues. Rodehell is a greate rough Island with a saddle in the middest, which you must leave lying on the starboard side. The north poynt is a red poynt, there stand up long staves over end, like unto a Warder in Norway, you must goe clo∣se alongst by them, or you may runne in amidst the channell, according as shall be best convenient, but you may not goe close by the north poynt over against it (which the Dutch shippers doe call Jan Lambertsons poynt) because of a stony and steepe little riff which lyeth of from it, but you may runn about by it upon your lead in seven or eight fathom, but may come no neerer; the right fareway betwixt then both is fourteen and fifteen fathom deep.</P>
<P>Betwixt the poynt of Corsnes &amp; the Rode-hell, it is not without danger to turn to windwards, especially you must be very carefull not to run too far over to the south wards, but to the northwards, towardes the maine land it is indifferent cleane: It is there in the fareway fifteen fathom deepe, soft clay-ground.</P>
<P>For not to misse this foresayd channell; or the north point of the Rode-hell, then take the mark out a stearne of the little Fisher, bring that even without the poynt of Corsnes, &amp; keep it so standing sayling towards the Rode-hell, and so you shall not fayle to fal right before the channell. This is a sure mark whereupon you may trust. If you fall somewhat to the southwards of the foresaid channell, you can see opening, but seemeth to be all whole to the maine land, so that men (that are not well acquainted) might not know where to seek the channell, but sayling to the northwards the channell doth open itself.</P>
<P>When as you shall be then within the foresayd poynt of Rode-hell, you may anchor there where you please, &amp; fetch a Pylot from the land, which may bring you up to the towne Wybrough. It is there within fifteen fa∣thom deep, and good soft clay-ground.</P>
<P>If you wil (being come within the Rode-hell) saile up to Wybrough, then goe on east and by south a shot of a cast peece unto a black point, leave that about 2 cables lengths on the larboard side, for there it is not cleane. Being a little past this black point, then go on northeast, or eastnortheast a halfe league, and then you shall come against a great white sand-bay, but before you come by this sand-bay, you shall meet a rock with a gray stone like a buye upon the Flyestream, leave that foresayd rock on the starboard side, and the gray stone on the lar∣board side, &amp; run amidst the channell through betwixt them both, there it is three fathom deep. It is in no wise to bee done to sayle up there for him that hath not been re before, but it is best to anchor a little within Rodehell &amp; to let him be brought up by a Pylot.</P>

<P>There runneth also a Lieth through within the roc∣kes, where you may sayle alongst, and come out againe into the sea by Putsfagre, this runneth about very croo∣ked with many bights, but it is Pilots water.</P>
<P>If you will sayle to Borgo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borgo.</NOTE> then runne a league to the eastwards of the foresayd rock Mely, there you shall finde two high bare rockes, called the Tolcken, runne in betwixt them both, but neerest to the eastermost, which is cleane and cleare close to it, and lyeth some∣what further to seawards then the westermost. West∣northwest from this eastermost high rocke, lyeth a little rocke above water, leave that on the larboard side. When as then you shall be by this eastermost rock, which you leave lying on the starboard side of you, then goe on northnortheast to Schoeland, that is a rough Island off from which lye many bare poynts, all which you must leave (with the Island also) on the starboard side, then runne alongst close by these bare poynts. When you are past them, goe then northeast and by north, somewhat easterly, and so you shall see two other bare rockes, the eastermost of the greatnesse off a ship very steepe and high, but the westermost is small, run in there betwixt them: the Sound is called Cramerpoort.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cramer∣poort.</NOTE> When you are within them, goe then in north and by east, and then you shall presently meet with a greate Island called Carmer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cramer.</NOTE> leave that on the starboard side,

<P>From the Sweeds Ioufer to the channell of Wester∣wyke, or Silbuy, the course is northnorthwest 7 leagues, but from Northeroorden the north-end of Oeland north∣west 8 leagues.</P>
<P>The channell of Westerwyke and Silbuy is called Ide∣sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idesound.</NOTE> after a great rock lying on the north side of this channell, called Ydehoe, off from it lye many rocks, some above and some under water 2 great leagues to seawards, which are called Idebanks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idebancks</NOTE></P>
<P>He that will saile from the north-end of Oeland towards the barsound, and by bare winds doth come a little to the westwards, without the right fareway, must be very care∣full, and take good heed that he get not in amongst them.</P>
<P>For to know the channell of Westerwyke, you shall see a high bare rock, bring that northwest from you, and saile so right in with it, &amp; then you shall fall with the land right before it, &amp; then also you shall espye another bare rocke, whereupon standeth a Fishers beakon, and also another to the southwards of it, with a mast, sayle in betwixt the two rocks, the channell lyeth in northwest and northwest and by north when you are come within them you may sayle alongst through the rocks where you desire to be, to Silbuy, Strixholm, Flourbuy, Vrowenberg, Westerwy-up to the northwards to Schelsuyt &amp; other places more, there it is all cleane ground, and 12, 15, 18, and 20 fathom deep.</P>

<P>The north end of Oeland runneth somewat far off flat. If you run out close by Oeland, and saile on north &amp; by west, then you runne alongst farre enough without the Idebancks, and so shall fall with the land about a halfe league to the southwards of Barsound<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barsoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> against a deal of low out-rocks. It seemeth a far off (by reason of the multitude of rocks and little Islands to be all firme land, but comming near it, it is all broken. You shall see there also an Island by which there seemeth to be a channell, but you must be further to the northwards, run alongst by the coast in 7 fathom, so long untill that you see out a head an high out-rock, these shall be the Heerscharen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heerscha∣ren.</NOTE> which are very foule, and lie off from the north point of the channell, a good waies eastsoutheast into sea, all which you must leave on the starboard side and run a∣longst by them unto the channell.</P>

<P>About an English mile within the Sound, you leave (in sayling up) the Taldersound<NOTE PLACE="marg">Talder∣sound.</NOTE> on the larboard side, there is no more then 6 or 7 foot water, from thence you edge up north and also northeast a half league, then again west and by south about 2 league, afterwards westnorthwest a league unto Karholm, which is a Gentlemans house with a mill.</P>
<P>From Karholm to Stickbrough is further west about two leagues, that is a castle upon a little Island, you must go about to the southwards of it through a bridge.</P>
<P>From Stickbrough<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stickborg</NOTE> sayle up alongst the Sound, &amp; leave most of all the rocks (which you see) on the larboard side, except one or 2 a little above Stickbrough, leave them on the starboard side. About 2 leagues past Stick∣bourgh standeth a Gentlemans house called Mem, there is the place where men do lade, a half league from South∣ercopping.</P>
<P>For to sayle from without the the Northercopping, you run in by the Swartbodem up westwards unto Schenes and Braburch, and alongst unto the Barwyk the sound of Northcopping, or else you must come in at the Barsound through within the rocks into the Brawyke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brawyke.</NOTE> unto North∣ercopping but it is not to be done without a Pilot for them that are not there very well acquainted, for it is Pilots water.</P>
<P>From the north end of Oeland to the channell Nycop∣ping by the Hevering,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hevering.</NOTE> the course is due north about 18 or 19 leagues, but if you run close alongst by the end of Oeland, you shall fall with the land a little to the west∣wards of the Hevering. The Hevering is a great reddish bare rock, whereupon stand 3 or 4 Fishers beacons, here∣tofore there was wont to stand up on it a barrell upon a mast, which men might see far of at sea, but it is taken off in the last wars between the Kings of Sweden and Den∣mark, now there standeth nothing upon it but some Warders.</P>
<P>Two great leagues to the westwards of the Hevering, to witt, southwest from it, lye the foresayd rocks called the Swartboden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Swart∣boden.</NOTE> which are great rocks, &amp; are sometimes mistaken for the Hevering, you may sayle in also by these Swartboden, and run through within Oxelen and the other rocks, &amp; come by the poynt of Hommelwyke into the right sound of Nycoppen.</P>
<P>When you come before the channell of the Hevering, you can at first hardly see a channell, or any opening, but bring the great rock the Hevering northwest from you, &amp; sayle so right in, and run-in close alongst to the north∣wards of it. In the sayling in you shall see two channells, the northermost is within full of dangers, so that you cannot go through there. The right channell by the He∣vering it so narrow, that you can hardly turne too and again there.</P>
<P>From the Hevering you must saile in first n. w. a league and half, or 2 leagues, unto a great rock, leave it on the starboard side, &amp; sayle about by it, &amp; goe in alongst n. w. &amp; by north. A little within the foresayd great rock, thwart of the poynt of the Hommelwyke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hommel∣wyke.</NOTE> you shall finde also a great rock on the starboard side, you may run about to the westwards of it untill you come within the other rocks &amp; little Islands, and anchor there in 3 fathom soft ground: but if you wil anchor there, then you must shun somewhat the w. end of the great Holm, because of a suncken rock that lyeth even without the point of the rock. From that foresaid road unto Hassellholm the course is yet in alongst n. w. and north but with ships of great draught you must anchor before the channell of Hasselholm. From the He∣vering to the Hassell-holm it is in all about 3 or 4 leag.</P>
<P>From Hassell-holm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hassell-holm.</NOTE> alongst upwards through the stone reach, it is not deeper then nine foote, you must also (if you will sayle up there) first set the rockes, or suncken rockes with beakons with your boat or else you should sometimes sayle upon some of the rockes in seven foot depth. The narrowest of the Stone-reach<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stone-reach.</NOTE> is thwart of an Island which you must leave on the starborard side, off from which lyeth a suncken rocke in the narrow, you must goe close alongst by the suncken rock, for to the westwards of it is very shoale water. Being past this stony ground, you shall get oasie ground, where it is not deeper then sixe foot; being come over that by the town Nycopping,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nicop∣ping.</NOTE> it is again eight foot deep, but stony ground. This ships lye without the towne thwart of the beakons over against the Castle, which lyath on the west side of the river.</P>
<P>From Hassell-holm to the town Nycopping it is about a league first up north and by w. and afterwards west. For one that is unacquainted, it is not easy to sayle up, it is also Pilots water, so soone as you come within the chan∣nell, you can get a Pilot to bring you where you desire to be.</P>
<P>From Nycopping you may sayle alongst through the rocks to the northwards off Hassell-holm unto Trosa and Telghen.</P>
<P>Landesoort<NOTE PLACE="marg">Landsoort</NOTE> (which is the west poynt of the Liet of Stockholm) lyeth from the Hevering east and by north distant 6 or 7 leagues.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt both lyeth a great high rock very easy to be knowne, a good wayes without the land alone called Hartsoe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hartsoe.</NOTE> and a little league to the west∣wards of Landsoort lye also some fowle out-rocks, called the Heyr-hamer. When as you sayl from the Hevering on eastnortheast, then you run alongst a little without the Hartsoe, leaving it on the larboard side. With that coursey, on cannot also sayle too neere the Heyr-hamer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heyr-ha∣mer.</NOTE> and then you leave it lying also on the larboard side to∣wards the land.</P>
<P>The land to the westwardes of Landsoort lieth w. or w. and by north with divers great rockes and havens where you may sayle into, About a league to the westwards of it lyeth a haven within a low rock in betwixt two other low Rocks, there you must make you fast with cables on both shoares, and with an anchor in the Sound. Before the havens mouth lyeth a high round rock, which shut∣teth the havens mouth.</P>
<P>A little to the westwards off Hartsoe goeth in a haven or Deep, where you may run through with Barkes within Elsnap unto Stock-holm.</P>
<P>A little to the westwards of that Deep lyeth the Sound of Telghen lying in northwest, allmost unto the great Lack de Mell, upon the end of that Sound lyeth Tel∣gen, but at the mouth of the Sound lyeth a little towne Torsa.</P>
<P>About an English mile southwest from the poynt of Landsoort, lye 2 rockes even with the water, and within these rockes close by Landsoort lyeth also a suncken rock. He that commeth from the southwardes, being bound to Stokholm, and falleth with the land to the westwards of the poynt of Landsoort, must take heed of them; you may sayle within these two rockes (lying even with the water) to wit, betwixt them &amp; the foresayd suncken rock, and also (as Pilots say) you may sayle through within the suncken rock, that is, betwixt the suncken rock and the mayne land.</P>
<P>Landsoort and the north poynt of Oeland lye south∣southwest and northnorthe. a little more northerly and a little more southerly distant 23 or 24 leagues. If you sayle on northnortheast from the north end of Oeland, you shall fall with the land right with Landsoort, or a little to the eastwards of it. It is better to fall with the land somewhat to the westwards of it, then to the eastwards of it, to the westwards the land is better to be known then the rocks to the eastwards off it. Therefore when as you will sayle from the north end of Oeland to Stockholm, especially in dark weather, goe on somewhat more northerly then n. n. e. or north &amp; by east, &amp; then you shall runne in sight off the foresayd rock Hartsoe, which is easy to be kno∣wne.</P>
<P>The Lieth of Stockholm goeth in northeast by the poynt of Landsoort. About a league east from the point¦ly
<PB N="100" REF="145"/> some black rocks, some above and some under water, called the Karwasen. Betwixt them and the poynt, about once so neare the Karwasen, as the poynt, lyeth an other black rock, not great called the young Karwasen, betwixt that rock and the poynt off Landsoort, men doe sayle into the channell of Stock-holm. Close to the poynt lyeth also a little Island which you must leave on the lar∣board side, and run alongst to the eastwards of it, a league northeast from the poynt lyeth the Wigstone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W gstone</NOTE> lying southeast or eastsoutheast thwart off from the shoare. This a somewhat a long rock with tree hommocks, the two westermost are the greatest, and shew like a saddle the eastermost hommock is the smallest, upon it stand∣eth a little walled cape, you must sayle alongst to the eastwards of it, and leave the rock on the larboard side. You may well sayle also about to the westwards of this Wigstone, it is cleane round about, but on the west side it is narrowest, betwixt it and the land lyeth also a rock, with a little rock off from it, which you must avoyd.</P>
<P>A league northeast from the Wigstone lyeth the Middle-stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddle-stone.</NOTE> which is a great high rock with a great cliff or saddle, with another great rock a little to the westwards of it: you cannot sayle through betwixt them, they are fast one to the other with rocks. In sayling up men leave this Middle-stone on the starboard side, and run about to the westwards of it.</P>
<P>From by east the Wigstone to the Middle-stone, to witt, alongst to the westwards of it, the course is north∣northeast. About a great English mile east from the Wigstone, and north from the Karwasen lyeth another rock, called the Gomberg-stone<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mberg stone.</NOTE> and to the eastwards of it another, called Schaeropen. When you sayle from the Wigstone to the Middle-stone, you leave them both on the starbord side.</P>

The Middle-stone lyeth about a half league southwest from the east poynt of the Lieth, to witt, from the e. poynt off the main land, or the Swedes schares, be∣twixt them both goeth in a channell, called the Danske channell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nske-c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annell.</NOTE> For to sayle in there you must avoyd the fore∣sayd east poynt a good wayes off (whereupon standeth a mill) and run in by the Middle-stone, for from that poynt runneth of a great ledge off rocks a good wayes to seawards, towards the Middle-stone. From by west the Middlestone to Elsnap; the course is northeast three leagues.</P>
<P>When you are a little past the Middle-stone, you come in betwixt the two lands, and a little within the east poynt you shall meet with a rock in the fareway, called the Red-Cow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Cow.</NOTE> You may sayle about it on both sides, but men leave it commonly on the starboard side, within that rock, that is on the north side you may anchor.</P>
<P>Elsnap<NOTE PLACE="marg">El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nap.</NOTE> is a haven behinde two little Islands, where the Kings ships of wart do commonly lye to tarry for a winde, when they are bound to sea, there it is very easy lying, when with contrary windes you can neither get up nor down, you can come in and out there both from the northwards and from the southwards very conueniently. Comming from the southwards, you can see over the southermost little Island, the masts of the ships that lye behind it. For to sayle in there behind it, run in about by the s. poynt of the Island Elsnap behind it, and then you leave a little black rock on the south side of the havens mouth lying on the larboard side. Betwixt the two little Islands of Elsnap runnes also a channell through where you may go through with Huyes and small ships. From thwart of Elsnap, the course is inwards northnortheast about two leagues, to the Red-holm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Redholm</NOTE> that is a great Red round rock grown full of trees, to the westwards off it lyeth another smaller bare rock, the fareway is there in through betwixt them, and about a musket shot broad in this narrow it is all over good anchor-ground.

When as you sayle through betwixt the Redholm &amp; the foresayd bare rock to the eastwards of it, go then on yet about an English mile further north∣northeast untill you come thwart of the fourth channell counting from the Red-holm which lyeth through the foresayd row of rockes to the northwards of the Red∣holm, that is called S. Johns channell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Johns. channell.</NOTE> it lyeth through about northnorthwest, or somewhat more northerly, it is a short Inlet, run through there. Being through S. Johns channell, goe again northnortheast about an English mile to the Red-holm, which is a long rock upon it stand three barrels upon masts, this you must leave on the lar∣board side, and run alongst to the eastwards of it. From the north poynt of that Red-holm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Redholm.</NOTE> runneth of a little riffe or shoale, which you must avoyd. From the Red-holm unto the great Daler,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Da∣ler.</NOTE> the course is northw. and by north, that is a haven on the west side of the Liet, there lyeth a Church-yard within on the land, where the slain Poles people in the last Polish wars lye buried, Thwart of that Church-yard is a Sand-bay, there is good anchor ground, like as is all over in that foresayd haven. At the north poynt of the haven the great Daler lyeth a suncken rock close by the land, called the Saltsack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saltsack.</NOTE> upon which is no more ten nine foot water. From the great Daler, the course is alongst northeast, a half league unto the little Daler,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Da∣ler.</NOTE> which is a high steep rock, the highest that you find amongst all the the rocks in the Lieth, run alongst to the westwards of it, and leave it on the starboard side. Over against it on the west side lyeth another rock, which is called also the Daler, to the westwards of it, to wit, be∣twixt that rock and the main land, is also an opening, where you may sayl through. A little within that fore∣sayd rock on the westland goeth in the Hardstick<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hartstrick</NOTE> which is a Sound that lyeth in first west, and west and by north, a good wayes in, and then northwest and commet into the Lieth to the northwards of Waxholm, by Kings ha∣ven. The Kings Majesty hath caused to sink some ships in the mouth of the Sound, so that men cannot goe through there with great ships, but onely with little barks. From the little Daler, the course is northnorthwest about a halfe league to Steendeur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Steendeur</NOTE> a great Island, which you must leave on the starboard side, and run close alongst by it and so you shall leave a round rock to the southwards over against it on the larboard side, and sayle through betwixt them: this channell lyeth through northwest. At the west end of the great Island Steendeur lyeth a little black rock, you must run about by it again to the east∣wards.</P>
<P>From Steendeur to Kow-haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kow ha∣ven.</NOTE> the course is east∣northeast two leagues, that is a rock lying in the broad Sound, leave it on the starboard side, &amp; sayl to the west∣wards of it alongst by the west land unto Berck-haven. Betwixt both about half wayes lyeth a haven, called the Crosse-haven, there it is good lying for west and north∣west winds.</P>
<P>Berckhaven<NOTE PLACE="marg">Berckha∣ven.</NOTE> lyeth from Cow-haven northeast and by north distant about two leagues: this is a haven betwixt two Islands where is good anchoring for all winds, as well for them which come from Stockholm, and desire to sayle to the Northbodem, as also for them that will sayle off towards Landsoort, there is (like as at most places be∣twixt the rocks and Islands) good clay ground. When you come from Kow-haven, and are bound to Stock∣holm, you must leave these two Islands of Berck-haven on the starboard side, and run in about betwixt them and the poynt of the maine land. From the narrow betwixt Berck-haven and the foresayd poynt to Duer-haven<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deur-haven.</NOTE> the course is northwest about a halfe league. On the south∣west side of that fareway thwart of the point over against Duer-haven, lye two suncken rocks on each side of the poynt one, the one on the northwest side, and the other on the southeastside, commonly there standeth upon each of them a little tree for a beakon.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Deur-haven unto the Draybome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Draybom</NOTE> the course is southwest and by west somewhat westerly
<PB N="101" REF="145"/> about a halfe league, it is called also the Duer-haven, of from the poynt with in the Islands untill you come be∣fore the buye, alongst there, and also within the Islands, it is good lying every where.</P>
<P>The litttle Islands which lye in the channell of the Draybome, you must leave them on the starboard side of you.</P>
<P>From the Draybome to the Windstream,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wind∣stream.</NOTE> the course is first north, &amp; north &amp; by west untill about halfe wa∣yes, there you shall find a little Island with a little tree, leave that on the larboard side, and goe from thence in n. northwest to the Windstream. In the Windstream is a good anchoring by the shoare, except in the north end of the stream, there is no anchor ground. From the Draybome to the Windstream it is about a league distance.</P>
<P>From the Windstreame to the Seugh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Seugh.</NOTE> the course is westnorthwest a half league, that is a chindle or stone∣banck even with the water, runne alongst to the north∣wards of it, and leave it on the larboard.</P>
<P>From the Seugh to Scheggen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheggen</NOTE> the course is west and by north a league, run alongst there by the south shoare. When you come against Scheggen, you shall see upon the poynt of the south shoare a little round tree, over against that little tree somewhat more northerly then in the middle off the channell, lyeth a suncken rock, for to avoyd it you must run nearest the south shoare. The reach off Scheggen lyeth through west, and west &amp; by south about an English mile, it is narrow, but hath every where anchor ground.</P>
<P>From Scheggen, the course is westsouthwest an En∣glish mile to Steck-sound, or west to Kings-deep, the little Islands on the starboard side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Steck-holm.</NOTE> as you saile to Steck-sound, are cleane round about, so that you may goe on all sides about by them.</P>
<P>Comming close to Steck-sound you shall finde a sunc∣ken rocke a little by south the fareway. The Steck-sound lyeth through southsouthwest, it is a short Inlet about a cables length long.</P>
<P>From Steck-sound unto Waxholm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wax∣holm.</NOTE> it is southwest westerly above an English mile. Upon Waxholm stand∣eth the Kings Castle, there all the ships are visited whether they go up or down, the channell there by it, is paled to so neare, that they can shut it with a barre.</P>
<P>From Waxholm to the Wester reach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wester reach.</NOTE> the course is westsouthwest and through the Wester reach southwest. From thence alongst west to Eeldam, that is a very nar∣row channell a little more then a ships length broad.</P>
<P>From Eeldam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eeldam.</NOTE> the course is west to Mouseholm, which is about a league from Waxholm, men leave the high rough Mouse-holm on the starboard side, and run alongst by it to the southwards.</P>
<P>From the Mouse-holm<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouse-holm.</NOTE> to Kings-haven it is a league west, and west and by north all alongst by the south∣land.</P>
<P>From Kingshaven<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings ha∣ven.</NOTE> unto the town Stockholme, the course is northwest, and northwest and by west, also a league distance along by the shoare. When you come before the Towne, you may anchor where you please.</P>
<P>He that falleth to leewards, or by any other accident cannot come by Landsoort into the Liet of Stockholm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stock∣holm.</NOTE> he may sail in more to the northwards through divers channels. Amongst others there is one where men may sayle into, and come by the great Daler into the Lieth: there goeth another in by the Swedes-sand, through it men come by Berck-haven into the Lieth. The knowled∣ge off this channell is a very high rock, with another that is not so high, thereby to the southwards of it, be∣twixt these two rocks goeth in this channell, it is very narrow in the comming in, not above two shippes lengths broad. So soon as you come in within these rocks, you may edge up about by the lowest, which is the southermost, and anchor under it in very good anchor ground.</P>
<P>From that road in the Swedes sands the Sound goeth up first about n. w. &amp; by north, &amp; n. west, 5 leagues unto Berker-haven into the Lieth of Stockholm. This is a very easy channell as well for to sayle in as out, but because it is not easy to bee known, comming in out the sea, it is seldom used.</P>
<P>To the southwards or the westwards off these two foresayd rocks, at the comming in of this channell, it is all low land. If you come from the southwards, and run alongst by that low land, so long untill that you begin to get the high land, you shall also run in sight of these two foresayd hommocks. About a league to seawards from them, lye three or four small rocks; for to saile in there you must leave them on the starboard side, and in sailing out on the larboard side.</P>
<P>From the south-end of Oeland to the south-end off Gotland, the course is eastnortheast and northeast and by east three and twentye or foure and twentye leagues but to the Karels northeast somewhat northerly seven and twenty leagues.</P>
<P>The course alongst the farewaie, for to sayle from the south end of Oeland through betwixt Oeland and Got∣land, is northeast &amp; by north.</P>
<P>The Island Oeland is twentie four leagues long, and a league and half broad, when men sayle alongst by it, they may counte eighteene towards upon it, which are all flat: then east coast is a clean coast, &amp; lyeth north∣northeast &amp; southsouthwest, but about 7 or 8 leagues to the southwards of the north end, there shooteth off a little riffe, thwart from the land a great half league into the sea, which men must avoyd: by it goeth in a little haven, where indifferent shipps may goe in, otherwise Oeland hath no havens.</P>
<P>From the south end of Gotland runneth off a foule stonie riffe, a good wayes in to the sea, you may run about by it upon the lead in seven, eight and nine fathom.</P>
<P>The Karels are two little high Islands, lying on the west side of Gotland north and by west about seven leagues from the south poynt of Gotland, and east and w. about a halfe league one from the other the greatest is called the greate Karell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Karell.</NOTE> and lyeth a great league from the land the smallest, the little Karell, and lyeth about a halfe league from the shoare. When you come from the southwards, the greate Karell sheweth it selfe in two hommocks, and the little Karell<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Ka∣rell.</NOTE> in one hommock, and nearer to the land. Under the little Karell is round about good roade, in eight, nine, and ten fathom, and is round about clean and cleare, without foule grounds. Men doe anchor betwixt it and the land, in sixe or seven fa∣thom, there it is good lying for all winds, as well for them that are bound to the eastwards, as to the west∣wards. He that shall be to the northwards of Gotland, and shall gett a contrarie wind, may also anchor under the great Karell, but under the Little Karell is farre the best roade. Under the great Karell men may anchor, on the west and east side but on the north and south side it is soule, therefore come no nearer it by night, then in eleven or twelve fathom. Betwixt the two Karels it is thirteen and fourteen fathom deep.</P>
<P>About half wayes betwixt the Karels &amp; the south end off Gotland, southsoutheast from the Karell, lyeth the haven Boswyke:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boswyke.</NOTE> thwarte of it runneth off a riffe, an the north side of the haven a good wayes from the shoare, come no nearer it then in seven or eight fathom. When you are thwart of the south poynt, about a halfe league from the land, and will sayle alongst to the north∣wards of Gotland, you must not sayl on more northerly then northwest, as well for to avoyd that riffe of Bos∣wyke, as for to sayle a weather the Karels.</P>
<P>Four leagues northeast from the Karel, lieth the Island Reefholm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reefholm</NOTE> thwarte of it men doe runne into Westergorte: you may sayle &amp; anchor round about it. A little to the northwards of it lyeth the northwest point of Gotland.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northwardes of the high poynt lyeth the towne Wisbuy, about seven leagues northeast
<PB N="102" REF="146"/> from the Karell. Men were wont in old tyme to lye there behinde a greate head or Chest.</P>
<P>Wisbuy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wisbuy.</NOTE> hath beene in tymes past a famous marchant towne, where was wont to be driven greate trade of marchandize, but it is now through the will of God, altogether fallen down, and come to nothing. The Hance towns haven a long time there held their staple. The old Sea laws were made there, and also the old fa∣mous Read-carde. Men may see yet to this day many old ruinous houses of costly marble and hewen stones, whereby men may partly perceive and Judge, what man∣ner of staltenisse there hath been.</P>
<P>From Wisbuy the coast lieth forth northeast &amp; by east towards the end of Gotland about nine leagues. But from the Karell to Gotshe sand, the course is northeast one &amp; twenty or two and twenty leagues: there is a little Island, whereupon dwelleth no people, and standeth full of trees: you may sayle round about it, which hath a white strand. From the northwest point thereof shooteth off a little riff, &amp; likewise one from the south point, a good waies off into sea, towards the north end of Goth∣land. On every side of Gotsche sand, you may anchor in six, seven, eight, nine, ten and twelve fathom, all clean and good anchor ground, but these foresayd riffes you must avoid. It lieth northnortheast six leagues distant from Faro, the north end of Gotland, when you ly there under it at anchor, you cannot see Gotland.</P>
<P>The Copper stone lieth from Gotsche sand north west and by west distant three great leagues.</P>
<P>Upon the south end of the east side of Gotland stand∣eth a high tower, called Howbrough, and thereafter the south end of Gotland also is called Howbrough. By it goeth in a little river, before which you may anchor in six or seven fathom.</P>
<P>Five leagues northeast from the aforesaid south point lieth Heyligh-holm, which is a good haven, but by rea∣son it is but little used, it is therefore also but little known.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the eastwards of Heyligh-holm lieth the haven of Narwyck, upon the east side of the Haven lieth a long rock, by which you must run in, and leave another sharp rock on the larboard side, within the haven you may anchor in four or five fathom.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the eastwards of it lieth Sandwyk which is a good haven for a west, northwest, northeast, and southeast winde, and lieth in about north, a south winde bloweth there open in: On the east point, (which is a low bare point) lieth a Holme, which is fast to the land, upon it standeth a Warder: From this point run∣neth off a little sandriffe, which you may sound about in five or six fathom. Within at this Holm is a bridge of Masts which lyeth off a little from the shoare. If you will anchor there in the Haven, then run in alongst by the east shoare, untill you come within the bridge, and anchor there nearest shoare, so that the foresayd east poynt do stand southeast, or southeast and by south from you, in four fathom, four and an half, or five fathom, there is cleane clay sand ground, and very easy lying for west, north and east winds.</P>
<P>A league to the eastwards of Sandwyck lying the Island of Eastergore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Easter∣gore.</NOTE> about halfe wayes betwixt both the ends of Gotland n.e. from the s.w. poynt, this is a bare Island without trees. Under this Island is very easy road for all windes, as wel for them that are bound to the eastwards, as to the w. wards. Comming from the westwards, or from Sandwyck alongst by the land, then is the northw. poynt, (which is a high bare gray piont) hiddē behinde a point of the maine land of Gotland, so that it seemeth a farre off to be no Island, but comming near it, it openeth it self, that you may see large enough thorough betwixt them: sayle in there betwixt them both in the midst of the channell, it is there clean and clear, but somewhat une∣ven of ground, to wit, eight, ten, twelve and fourteen fathom, but you need not feare. If you will anchor under it for northeast or east winds, then anchor betwixt the land and the Island, so that the aforesaid bare gray north∣west poynt stand north, and the southermost east from you, in nine or ten fathom. Or if you will anchor for a south, southwest, or west winde, then run further in about by that aforesaid bare gray poynt, bring it south-southwest from you, and anchor there in seven, eight, nine, or ten fathom, there it is cleane ground of small white &amp; black sand. A little to the northwards of the Island is a great Bay on Gotland, there you may also anchor in seven and eight fathom, for westerly windes.</P>
<P>If you will sayl in or out, to the northwards of Easter∣gore then come not very near the Island, because there lieth off a riffe from the east point farre into the sea, which is a great half league without the land, not deep∣er then two fathom &amp; a half, stony and very uneven, and is to be throught, that nearer to the land it is shoaler and fouler. From the southeast side runneth off also a flat, a good wayes to Seawards, at some places not deep∣er then three, four &amp; five fathom, and also very uneven, whereof you must take heed.</P>
<P>Foure leagues north and by east from Eastergore lyeth a haven, called Sliet or Sliet haven, lying in north and north and by west, behind some little Islands, there it is good lying for easterly, westerly, &amp; n. winds. Upon one of the norther must little Islands standeth a ruinous church. You must come in there alongst by the shoare from the southwards. From thence to Farosound the coast lyeth north and by west two leagues.</P>
<P>Farosound you may run into, in two and three fathom water, there standeth a Church with a flatte steeple upon the land, From Farosound lyeth off a foule danger∣ous riffe, a league and halfe, or 2 leagues into sea, called Salfonteyn, you must take very good heed there of, when you will run about to the northwards of Gotland.</P>
<P>From Farosound to Gotschesand, the course is north-northeast, about 7 leagues.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Depths and groundes about these Coastes.</HEAD>
<P>Betwixt the south ends off Oeland and Gotland in the fareway, it is uneven for to sound, sometimes men have two and twentie, three &amp; twentie, &amp; sometimes againe eight and twentie, nine and twentie, &amp; thirtie fathom, all black mingled ground, sometimes stones so great as pease, of colour like black earth.</P>
<P>When Howbrough is northnortheast 7 leagues from you, there it is fifteen fathom deep, stonie grounde, from thence on northeast 2 leagues, there it is twenty fathom deep, foule stonie ground. Neare about the places, so far from land that you cannot see Gotland, are bancks, where it is not deeper then twelve fathom. The like une∣vē grounds are also thwarte of the southend of Oeland, as hath beene said in the former, but betwixt them both is deeper water. If you come in the farewaye from Rye to Brontholm betwixt the south endes of Gotland and Oeland, and must lye by with contrarie windes, when you are in ten or twelve fathom, and then sayle to∣wards Oeland, you shall get deeper water.</P>
<P>If you lye by betwixt Oeland and Reef-coll, and that Reef-coll come to bee southsoutheast and south and by east from you, so farre without the land, that you can∣not see it, then you shall get also the like uneven ground of tenne and twelve fathom, redde grosse stonie sand, &amp; also blackish grosse sandie stone ground. If you bee near∣est to Oeland, you shall get, in tenne or twelve fathom pittes in the tallowe, so that it seemeth, that those grounds off Oeland doe run over unto, or neare Reef-coll. The like grounds and unevenesse doe seeme to lye over the sea also from the south end of Gotland towar∣des Rosehead: for when the south end of Gotland com∣meth to be about north from you, although it be four∣teene or sixteen leagues from you, you shall finde depth of sixteen &amp; twentie fathom soft grounde, like as off from Oeland, but if Gotland be more easterly or westerly from you, you shall have deeper water.</P>
<PB N="103" REF="146"/>
<P>When you are about a league by west the southwest poynt of Gotland, so that it be southeast, or eastsouth∣east from you about a league, then the Karels lye about north from you, which you may even see in cleare wea∣ther, there aboutes it is shoale water a good wayes off from the shoare. When the west poynt or steepe poynt is about north from you a little to the east∣wards or to the westwards of it, there is tenne, twelve, fourteene, sixteene, and eighteene fathom deepe, a great wayes from the land: but when that poynt commeth to be northeast, eastnortheast, or east from you, there it is above fortie fathom deep.</P>
<P>Betwixt the southwest poynt of Gotland, and the north poynt of Oelandt it is also verie deepe, so that there you cannot cast ground with fortie fathom.</P>
<P>When you are northwest and northwest and by north about two leagues from Houbrough there you have great redd stone sand, &amp; black stones in it, so great as beanes.</P>
<P>Betwixt Gotland and the Sweeds schares in the fare∣waye it is four and thirtie, and sixe and thirtie and eight and thirtie fathom deepe, and close by Gotland five and twentie fathom.</P>
<P>When the tower of Houbrough is westnorthwest from you, so farre as you may see it from the poope, there it is thirtie and one and thirtie fathom deepe, but being northnorthwest from you it is shoaler, five and twentie and sixe and twentie fathom.</P>
<P>Betwixt Howbrough and Eastergore lyeth a banck of four and twentie fathom, grosse redd sand, so farre without the land, that you cannot see the land out of the top. To the eastwards of it lyeth another banck of four∣teen fathom gray and white sand, when you are over it, you shall have no ground in fortie fathom.</P>
<P>Two leagues without the land, by west Eastergore, there it is about one &amp; thirty fathom soft ground.</P>
<P>He that sayleth from Brontholm alongst by Oeland towards Eastergore, let him not spare his lead, but sound often for these aforesayd bancks and groundes; thereby you may well make some reckoning.</P>
<P>If you should make reckoning to come by night with Gotland on the southeast side, and have no good sight, then come no nearer the land (about the north end or south end, also by Eastergore) then in twentie or four and twenty fathom, and so you can take no hurt by night. By day you may come neare enough to it at many places, in seven, eight or tenne fathom.</P>

In this fare waie it is a foote deeper, then if you sailed right through.</P>
<P>For to avoyde Muyen sand: men were wont to bring the houses which were wont to stand upon Tyoort to the southwards of the Heyliger-stee at Amsterdam, the∣reby you may make some reckoning, they are good longst markes: when Monnickedam is about the west end of Schyteldoecks-haven, and the house at Muyen betwixt Weesp and the church at Muyen, then are you thwart of Muyen sand. For to saile right through over Pampus, then keepe the steeple of Diemen over or a∣bout the point of Tyoort, so long as you can see Tyoort, that is a right longst marke for to saile over Pampus.</P>
<P>When you are come thwart of the east end of Mar∣ken, goe then on northeast, or somewhat more eastward∣ly towards the Fall of Urck, which is seven leagues: when you are come with in a great league of Urck, you shall meete with a hard sand, called the Houtribbe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hout¦ribbe.</NOTE> lying southeast and northwest thwart over the Fare waie, the∣re is no more water upon it, then upon the Flat of Wieringen, or of Freesland, you shall finde also no dee∣per water there then eight through.

There is in the right fare waie, two foot lesse then five fathom, &amp; soft ground. When the steeple of Medenblick commeth to the northwards of the house of Medenblick, so farr as the house is broa∣de, then you are cleare of Cripple sand, and past it; goe then on northwest, and northwest and by north to the buye upon the Creyl, according as the winde and tyde shall be, the right farewaie there, is deep five fathom scarce.

Twisch a sharpe steeple to the westward of Medenblick, commeth over Almerdorp, there was wont to bee a litt∣le flat steeple, but it is fallen downe, and therefore now not soo well to bee knowne, that was a right thwart-marke. Upon Wieringhen standeth a cape, bring East lander steeple, which is a flat steeple upon Wieringen, right over the cape, and sayle so right with it, and you shal come right with the buy. When you are at the buy, Westlander Church commeth then over Cleverstee, and the eight mils to the eastwards of Medenblick, a little without the Towne. For to finde the deepest of the flat comming from the Cripple, you must bee carefull to looke out for the foresayd markes. If that Twisch come first to Almerdorp, before Cleverstee come to Westlan∣der Church, then you are to neare to Breesand, or the grounds on the starboard side, these are sure markes for to sayle over the flats, when there lye no buyes. Alongst to the eastwards of the buye is the deepest water. If you will anchor before the Wieringer flat, then come no nea∣rer the Flat then when Twisch commeth a little to the Northwards of Opperdoes, or halfe way betwixt Op∣perdoes and Almerdorp.</P>
<P>For to sayle from the foresayd souther buy over the Gammels to Medenblick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to fail over the Gam∣mels to Meden∣blick.</NOTE> you must bring the wester∣most water-mill of the eight (which stand to the east∣wards of Medenblick) a capstone barres length without or to the eastwards of the Bulwarke of the Towne, and sayle then boldly without feare right in with them, untill that you come into the road where the ships common∣ly lye, or else, if you desire to goe into the Haven, then sayle in right to the northerhead, there is nothing that can hurt you, But if you must turne to windwards over the Gammels, and that your ship draweth more then eleven foot water, then runne not Further over to the westwards, then that the foresayd Water-mill com∣meth almost within, or a handspikes length to the fo∣resayd Bulwark, soo that yet you may well see through betwixt them, then cast about, &amp; run over to the east∣wards, soo long untill Grootebrooke come in the five water-milles, which stand to the eastwards of Warmers∣hoof, or on to the eastwards of them, so you shall not doe amisse, for it is there broad and wide.</P>
<P>If you desire to sayle over the Gammels to Meden∣blick, when you come from the Flye, then bring the steeple of Opperdoes over the westermost Water-mill of five, which stand to the westwards of Medenblick, and runne in soo right with them, untill that the wester∣most water-mill oft eight (to the eastwards of Meden∣blick) come to stand a capstone barres length without the Bulwark, as here before once already hath been sayd. Having these marks thus, and that it doe become darke, then goe on south &amp; south and by east, accor∣ding as the wind and tide shal serve, and you shall not doe amisse, neither shall you misse the Town.

U∣pon these foresayd markes, &amp; 13 foot, lyeth a buye with three legges, &amp; on the foresayd west shoare lye three drift-beakons in 12 foot, and then commeth the wester-most water-mill (of the eight which stand to the east∣wards of Medenblick) and so you shall not have lesse wa∣ter then upon the Wieringer flat.</P>
<P>From the Souther-buye to the second or middle buye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail over the Wie∣ringen flat.</NOTE> the course is northwest and northwest and by north: but for to find the deepest water, goe first north∣west so long untill that Ypels-hoofs Church come over the water-mill, which is called the Bolmill, and then forth n. w. and by n. When the Cornmill upon Wierin∣gen commeth in the swamp off the Oever, then you ha∣ve the length of the second Buye, which lyeth upon the west, or the south end of a little plate, called the Repell, the faire way is alongst to the westwards of it, there being at low water two fathom large, and at high water scarce three fathom deep. On the west side of the fayre way, betwixt the souther-buye, and the middle-buye, nearest the middle-buy, lyeth a hard sand called the Sow, or the old Sow, which on the east side is very stee∣pe and needle to which (in sayling up) men might say∣le within a poynt or tayle of it: to the westwards of it shooteth off another tayle to the northwards, a great wayes towards the Northeast buye. Upon the outer∣most, or northermost poynt, called Seughoort, standeth alwayes a beakon. Upon Wieringer upon the Oever stand two little capes with barrels on them, the one upon the North-end off the Oever, and the other upon the head, they are so little, that you can hardly see them: when you come off from the souther-buye towards the middle-buye, then keepe them not one in the other, for if you keepe them one in the other, then you will bee very close by the south shoare, and shall but even run cleare of the old Sow, but keep the southermost a little to the westwards of the northermost, and then you shall run alongst the right fareway, and shall not take any hurt of the old Sow. When you come neare the middle-buy, you must leave these marks and use them then no longer.</P>
<P>From the middle buye unto the Norther-buye, the course is northnorthwest, when you come thwart off the norther-buye, then commeth Oostlander Church and the Cornmill both over a little Chappell covered with red tiles, that stand upon the Oever, thwart off it also standeth the foresayd beakon upon Seughoort. By the Norther-buye it is scarce three fathom deepe at high water, the fareway is alongst to the westwards off it. When you co∣me by the norther-buye, keepe still the foresayd North∣northwest course, untill that Oostlander Church come to the northwards of the Sedge-dyke of the Oever, and then you are past the little plate which lyeth by the Northerbuye.</P>

And likewise runneth the ebbe also longer out, then the lowest water. When the Moon is south, or some∣what more westerly, it beginneth apparantly to flow without on the strand, and likewise upon the shoals.</P>
<P>The fore-flood, and the after-ebbe out of the Tessel, fall both one with the other n.n. e. thwart over the grounds and channels, and right out at the Spanjards channell, untill halfe flood: &amp;c to the contrary, the fo∣re-ebbe, with the after-flood fall right in at the Span∣jards channell s. s. east over the south grounds, and thwart over the Slenk and the other channels, untill half ebbe. A little while before half flood, the flood beginneth to runne right in at the channel, and againe a litle before half ebb, the ebbe beginneth to fet right out at the channel. Therefore hee that wil sayle into the channels, must reckon his tydes very wel, wherein con∣sisteth very much. Without before the channel in the sea, the tyde turneth about with the Sunne, so that when a shippe doth lye at an anchor without the channels, &amp; hath neither good nor hurt of the waves of the sea, it should have but a little still water.</P>
<P>In the North Sea the tyde falleth round, more then halfe tyde, upon the Broad fourteene, it turneth about with the Sunne or the Moone, and falleth but a quarter tyde right alongst the sea. Nearer the coast of Holland &amp; Zealand, the tyde falleth (whether it be flood or eb∣be) somewhat sloping towards the land, but in the midst of the tyde, it falleth right alongst the sea, and in the last of the tyde, it setteth to seawards, towards the westwards or the northwards.</P>

Somwhat to the southwards of the Maes, the after-flood turneth about against the Sunne, but to the northwards of the Maes, is turneth about with the Sunne, untill the last quarter, and then it setteth towards the shore, or the coast next unto it. They say also, that alongst the coast of Holland, men have no helpe of the ebbe in turning to windwards towards the Maes, except they bee without sight of the land, because there goe no ebbes by the land when the wind is to the southwards of the west.</P>

When that Aerdenburgh commeth without the foresayd sand-hils of Casant, then you are past the drye Raen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Markes of the Raen.</NOTE> but it lyeth yet out to the westwards with a great flat, soo farre to the westwards, untill Bridges commeth to the eastwards of Blanckenbrough in the Gallow sherds, which are high sand-hils to the eastwards of Blanckenbrough, where in times past was wont a Gallowes to stand, then you are past all the shoales, and may goe your course where you desire to be.

<P>BEtwixt Wenduynen &amp; Blanckenbrough standeth another little steeple, called Iohn Davids steeple. Oostend lyeth a great league to the westwards of Wackerhout. A halfe league to the west wards of Ostend, lyeth S. Catelyn, &amp; a league to the westwards of it is Midlekerck, being a high thick flat steeple. From Middle-kerck to Newport it is two leagues, there is a flat steeple with a little sharpe steeple. A little to the east∣wards of Newport lyeth our Lady of Lombardy, a high flat steeple.</P>
<P>From Newport to Broers it is two leagues, and from Broers to Dunkercke three leagues. The Southkoten is a league to the eastwards of Dunkerck. Dunkerck hath a high flat steeple, with a little sharpe steeple. From Dun∣kerck to Graveling are three leagues, betwixt them stand these steeples, first little Sinten a little sharpe steeple, great Sinten a thick flat steeple, Mardycke a thicke flat steeple, and S. Georges a high sharpe steeple, Grave∣ling hath no steeples, but there stand two mills, one on the Easter-gate, and the other on the west end of the towne. From Graveling to Callice are three leagues. Callice hath many sharpe Steeples, where of one is high∣er then all the rest, and betwixt both lye these villages most without steeples. First Hooghenpryse and Dasen, two flat steeples; more Valdam a flat Church with a litt∣le spire upon the middest of it, that is all the knowledge of Flanders. The Coast of Flanders betwixt Callice and Blanckenbrough, is foure and twenty leagues long, or as some say, one and twenty leagues, &amp; Blanckenbrough from Flushing nine leagues. Soo that Flushing is from Callice, at the least 30 leagues, or as some say 33 lea∣gues at the most.</P>
<P>That which is here sayd of the steeples and leagues alongst the coast of Flanders, is very serviceable and needfull as well for that which is before described of the Wielings, as also fot the sayling into the havens of Flan∣ders, but especially for the knowledge of the Flemish bancks.</P>
<P>For to sayle into Oostend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oostend.</NOTE> you must run close to the eastwards of the towne into the haven, called the Gueule on the east poynt of the haven lyeth a head, whereup∣on standeth a beakon, you must run close in by that head, there it is deepest, from the west side to wit to∣wards the towne, shooteth of a little flat, whereof you must avoyd that side a ships length or 2, at low water &amp; a common tyde remaineth in this havens mouth 6 foot, and at high water there is two and twenty foot water. A little within the haven you may anchor where you will, and at low water you may lye there with a great ship a float.</P>
<P>Newport<NOTE PLACE="marg">Newport</NOTE> is a tyde-haven, which falleth altogether dry at low water and at high water and a common tide there is 13 footwater, close before the havens mouth is a bank, which lyeth from the eastwards of the Haven of New∣port over to the westwards, thwart before the Havens mouth, and at halfe flood lyeth dry, and at high wa∣ter there commeth no more upon it then eight foot water.</P>
<P>He that will goe into Newport, must go in from the westwards betwixt the foresayd banck and the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to fall into New∣port.</NOTE> and sayle unto the southwards of the banck soo long untill that the innermost beakon come even through, or to the eastwards of the outermost, and then run in so right by them, &amp; in alongst amidst the channell betwixt the heads. Betwixt the banck and the land it is on both sides flat rising ground, so that you may sound the shoares on both sides, but on the north side the banck is some∣what steep, it is 3 fathom deep close alongst by it. With∣in the havens mouth it is set on both sides of the deep with beakons, where you must run through betwixt, untill you come before the Towne, which lyeth about a Cannon shot from the seaside. There is fire in the night upon the 2 great beakons, out not longer then from halfe flood to halfe ebbe.</P>
<P>From New-port to Dunkercke alongst by the shoare through within the banckes, it is cleane without any foule ground or bancks, and at low water fifteene foot deepe, the neerer the shoare the deeper. Thwart of the Cloyster Ten Duynen betwixt it and Broers banck, it is narrowest, which lyeth not farre from the shoare, thwart of it you must goe close alongst by the shoare.</P>
<P>The Quade-bancke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quade-banck.</NOTE> runneth of to the eastwards of the head of Dunkercke, at least two leagues to the west∣wards ending thwart of the heads of Dunkercke. To the eastwards of the easter head of Dunkerck mē may anchor behind this banck, and lye sheltred for a north∣west, north, and northeast winde, it is two fathom deepe there at low water, but in the comming in, it is shoaler. Before the Havensmouth of Dunkerck, it is 9 and ten fathom deepe, and to the westwards of the wester-head of Dunkerck, 6. 7. and 8. fathom, from thence men may runne over the small banck in three fathom, and come
<PB N="14" REF="164"/> against the Broad bancke. This small bancke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smal-banck.</NOTE> lyeth right thwart before the Haven of Dunkerck, to wit, betwixt Dunkercke and the Broad-banck.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into Dun∣kerck.</NOTE>For to saile into Dunkerck you must bring the fires within a capstane barrs length one to the other, to wit, the innermost so much to the eastwards of the outter∣most, keep them soo, and run in then close alongst by the easter-head, the wester-head lyeth somewhat fur∣ther of into the sea then the other, thwart of it lyeth a sandplate with some pales, therefore you must avoyd it, and runne in close alongst by the easterhead it is a narrow haven, &amp; at high water and a common tyde there com∣meth no more then 12 foot water. In the night they doe fire there as at Newport, from halfe flood to halfe ebbe, and the lowest fire-beakon standeth next unto the sea.</P>
<P>From the wester-head of Dunkerck runneth of a bancke about 2 leagues long, called the Splinter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Splin∣ter.</NOTE> which falleth dry at low water at many places, men may sayle in by the shoare, behind this banck from the westwards almost to the westerhead of Dunkerck, and there may come to an anchor in 5, 6, 7, and eight fathom.

<P>The haven of Callice<NOTE PLACE="marg">Callice.</NOTE> falleth every tyde altogether dry, and at high water with a common-tyde, there is no lesse then three fathom water. For to sayle in there you must keepe the mill (standing on the east corner of the towne) right over the easter-head, &amp; run in soo close alongst by the easterhead, and let the castle lye on the west side of you, from the wester head runneth of a lit∣tle the riffe, therefore you must avoyd it. When you are come in within the westerhead, you must goe up to the westwards into Paradice, and there lye dry at low wa∣ter. By night when the tyde serveth, there stand two fires, you must run in right with them. It is not good to come into this haven before high water, because of the exceeding strong tide that runneth in there with the flood, for to avoid the anchors of the ships, which lye there within. It is there within dangerous and bad lying, especially with a n. ly winde which bloweth there opē in.</P>
<P>Thwart of from wester-head of Callice lyeth a bank of two fathom, betwixt the head or Meyland, and the same banke men may runne through in three fathom at halfe flood, the bank is two fathom deepe.

From Black∣nesse to the River of Bul∣len, lyeth the coast south and by east three leagues, a league to the southwards of the Nesse, the land fal∣leth somewhat in with a faire sandy Baye. In this Baye lyeth a Fisher village on the coast, thwart of it in the sandy Baye is a very good roade for easterly windes, in 5. 6. 10. 15. and 16. fathom, according as you will lye farre from the shoare. For to anchor there, you must bring the steeple of the village over the middest of the houses. This place is called S. Iohns roade.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S.

<P>Upon the north poynt of the River of Bullen standeth a high thick Tower, called the Tourd' Ordre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tour d' Ordre.</NOTE> by sea men the Old-man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldman.</NOTE> a speciall mark for to know the Ri∣ver by. About an English mile to the northwards of this Tower, a little mile from the shore, lyeth a little suncken rock<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suncken rock.</NOTE> under water where a Huye or Smack may not goe over.</P>
<P>Upon the south poynt of the River of Bullen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bullen.</NOTE> standeth a stone wall, and upon it a great Beakon of a mast, thwart of it from the south poynt lyeth off a little riffe or shoale, that you must shun, and run close alongst by the Head, which lyeth at the north poynt, and hath been there lately made. When you are come within this Head, you must presently let fall your anchor and ride there; It is a tyde-haven, there you must goe in at high water, and at low water lye drye upon the chindle. Without, before the River, lyeth a banck, men were wont from the southwards to run in over in two fathom and from the northwards in three fathom but it is now to the southwards deeper through the scouring of the water alongst the foresayd Head which is made at the north poynt.</P>

For to sayle in there, bring S.

From the poynt of the Oordel lyeth of to the northwards a little riffe, upon the end of it lyeth a buy which you must leave on the starboard side, and run in close about to the northwards of it. From the point of the Oordell upwards, it is set allongst with beacons, you must run alongst close by them, untill you come within the poynt of S.

<P>For to sayle into the western-channell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sayle into the wester channel.</NOTE> comming from the east or the north, you must run alongst by the banks in six or seven fathom, and not neerer, they are so steepe, that a shipp sitting fast upon them with the fore castle, at the stern hath three fathom. Comming towards the land at the end of the bankes, you shall finde a buy. Or els if you come from the west, and bring Crotoye a cables length within the Oordell, and sayle soo right in, you shall finde the foresayd outermost buy. Besides this, there lye three other buyes, whereof that foresayd buye on the poynt of the Oordell is the fourth, &amp; the innermost: You must leave them all on the starboard side towards the land, and run in alongst by them to the northwards of them.</P>
<P>These channels and sands there within (all untill past S.

<P>Thwart of the Somme, it is farre off in to the sea shoale water, five, sixe, seven, eight, nine and ten fathom, three or foure leagues off into sea: He that commeth from the west, and findeth himselfe in darke and misty weather to bee in such shoaling, may bee well assured, not to bee farre from the Somme.</P>
<P>From the Oldman to Diep, the course is southsouth∣west 18 leagues, but from the Somme to Diep south∣west and by west eight or nine leagues.

Men may not sayle in there before flood, but not at halfe ebbe; at low water it fal∣leth altogether dry, but within at the Towne men may ride a float, at high water there commeth three fathom, or at the highest not more then 3 fathom and a halfe water, there come out alwayes Pilots to bring ships in.</P>

When the easter gate of New-haven com∣meth over the easter head, and the easter mill, sayle then so on, keeping them so, then you runne in right to the northwards of the Rettires, and alsoo you can take no hurt of the banck that lyeth towards Seynhead.

<P>To sayle from New-haven upwards towards Roan, is not well to be done without a Pilot, you must goe with the tyde through the first travaille or banckes, which lie from New-haven to Honfleur s. east, alongst by the souther-land, and from thence alongst the north side of the River to Quillebeuf, being come there, you are through the first travaille. You must alsoo bee well advised, and take good heed for the strong spring by the Normans, called La Barre, which everie tyde commeth on soo strong with the flood, that anchors and Cables have enough to doe to hold a ship: For that and other dangers more, it is not good nor con∣venient to sayle up the River without a Pilot.</P>

The east end is cle∣ane, men may sayle reasonable close alongst by it, but the west end is very foule: There lye some little Islands close by the west end, being passed them, men may sayle towards Iarsey without any feare.</P>
<P>To the southwards of the foresayd little Islands at the west end lyeth of a ledge of rockes within it, on the south side it is cleane, except at the south poynt, that is also foule. Hee that will anchor on the south side of Or∣nay, must be mindfull thereof, &amp; anchor a little to the eastwards of the Tydehaven.</P>
<P>From the west end of Ornay lyeth a great multitude of rockes west and by north, &amp; westnorthwest off three leagues into the sea.</P>
<P>Upon the outtermost and westermost end, lyeth a great high rock with many other smaller rocks about it. Halfe wayes betwixt this great rocke and Ornay lyeth another great rock, but not soo high as the foresayd westermost, from it lye off a multitude of rokes towards the outermost, which fall dry at low water, but at high water many lye under water. These two great rockes are called by the French Les Casquettes, and by the Dutch the Kiskassen, and by the English the Caskets.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catskets.</NOTE> Close by the west end of Ornay, towards the Caskets, lye other two great ranes of rockes, called the Barroches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barroches</NOTE></P>
<P>From the east point of Ornay to the east end of Gar∣nesey (about to the southwards of Ornay) the course is westsouthwest, 9 leagues; but from the Caskets to the west end of Garnsey southwest and by south, 6 lea∣gues.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der Garn∣sey.</NOTE>If you will anchor under Garnsey (comming from the Caskets) then runne on to the northeast poynt of Garnsey, and so farr to the eastwards of it, untill you get sight of the castle that standeth upon the rock on the east side of Garnsey.

<P>Under the south side of Garnsey men may ride for northwest, north, &amp; northeast windes. If you come from the west, or from the Caskets, you must runne close about by the southwest poynt, called C. de Gruse; and alongst by the south side of the Island, well halfe wayes the Island, and anchor there where you think good, in eighteene or nineteen fathom. If the wind shift to the southwest, or to the westsouthwest, then you may runne about by the south poynt unto the foresayd Castle▪ and anchor there either without or within it, as here before is sayd. From the aforesayd south poynt, lyeth off a little ledge of rocks, where of some rocks lye above, &amp; some under water, these you must avoyd when you sayle about by it.</P>
<P>South &amp; by west, and southsouthwest about eight le∣agues from Garnsey lyeth a great ledge of rockes, more then a league great, called Rockeduves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rocke∣duves.</NOTE></P>
<P>About 2 leagues southeast from Garnsey lyeth the Island Sarck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sarck.</NOTE> there men may anchor round about it in five and twenty, six and twenty, and seven and twenty fathom.

<P>Betwixt Garnsey and Sarck lye two other little Islands, Arck and Arem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arck, and Arem.</NOTE> or Harm, there men may sayle through betwixt them.</P>
<P>The Island Iarsey from Garnsey southeast distant 7 leagues, round about this Island are good roades at di∣vers places. All alongst the north side men may anchor in 10 &amp; 11 fathom. At the same north side, somewhat within the west poynt, lye some great rockes, a good wayes of from the shoare, called the Pater nosters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pater no∣ster.</NOTE> or Pierreleg. At the southwest poynt lye many rockes which lye of a great wayes into the sea, to the north∣wards of them, to wit, betwixt them and the westermost poynt, at the west side of Iarsey men may anchor at divers place in ten, eleven &amp; twelve fathom. At the south side of Iarsey is also a good road for a northwest &amp; w. n. w. Windes. At the east side lyeth Saint Cath∣erines baye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S.

<P>Cape de Voorha &amp; Granville<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anville.</NOTE> are two points that lie without the other land. About the south poynt of Gran∣ville lye two or three little rockes; along by them men must run in within a Pier or head, where the ships lye dry at low water. Betwixt cape de Hague, and Granville men may see upon the land many little houses, mills, &amp; trees, as they sayle alongst by it. A little to the south∣wards of the riffe Mortefaim standes a Church with two steeples, called Quotanse. All alongst this whole coast is every where good anchorage in 6 or seven Fathom, especially a little to the southwards of Cape de Hague.</P>
<P>About two leagues west from the poynt of Granville lyeth another great rane of rockes two great leagues long, lying east &amp; west, called La Shausee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">La Shausee</NOTE> betwixt them &amp; the poynt of Granville men must sayle through that are bound for Concalle or S.

<P>About five leagues to the southwards of Granville, in a great baye, lyeth an Island before the river of Avrantie about a league without the land, called Mount de S. Michiel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount de S. Michiel</NOTE> upon it lyeth a Castle, or little towne, called S. Michiel, with a high Tower which men may see at sea. This Bay is to the southwards of Granville, within the rocks of Concalle, very flat and rising ground, from thirteene, tenne, eight, sixe and foure fathom to one fathom, so that at low water the Bay falleth soo farre drye, that from the strand men see no sea nor water.</P>
<P>From Granville to the poynt of Concalle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concalle.</NOTE> the course is southwest 5 leagues, from that eastwards lye three rockes, under which men may anchor in ten fathom. For to sayle to the towne men must run in betwixt the poynt &amp; the foresayd rockes. It is betwixt them both eight and nine fathom deepe. Before the towne it is shoaler water. To the north-wards of the Towne lye other two rockes, there men may also anchor under in 5 and 6 fathom water.</P>
<P>From the outermost rockes by the poynt of Concalle untill you come before S. Maloes, the course is west, &amp; west and by south 5 leagues.</P>
<P>Before the haven of S. Maloes, lyeth an Island, called Sisember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Maloes Sisember.</NOTE> upon the west end thereof standeth a mill, and upon the east end a church with some little houses being a Friery, comming out of the sea, you can but even scarce see the Church, but being within the Island you may see it better, because it standeth on the south∣side of the Island. A great shot of a east peece to the eastwards of Sisember lyeth a great high rock, called the Meuwstone:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meuw∣stone.</NOTE> betwixt them and Sisember it is all full of rockes and stones, which at high water lye most under water: there is a little channell betwixt them both, which the French men use with theyr small shipping, through betwixt the rockes, but is not to be used with great shipping, neither by them that are not very well acquainted with it.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Meuwstone, and some other rockes to the eastwards off it, lyeth in a channell south and south and by east, called la Congie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">La Con∣gie.</NOTE> For to sayle in there you must runne in close aboard to the eastwards of the Meuwstone, southeast and by east right in with the towne, untill you bee gotten in two third parts of the distance (betweene the Meuwstone and the Towne) from the Meuwstone, &amp; are one third part of the distance from the Towne, that is when the Meuwstone is twice so farre from you as the Town, then you shal see by the northwest poynt of the Town two great rockes, about a cast peece shot from the foresaid poynt; upon each rock standeth a little house, the outermost is the smallest, &amp; is called the little Bee, the neerest to the Towne is the greatest, and is called the great Bee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle and great Bee.</NOTE> saile then towards them, and run in about them within a cables length of them, but keepe that course so long, untill that the little Tower (that standeth a little to the southwards of the towne upon the poynt) come over the tower of Bore a little to the eastwards of Saledoor, keepe them one over the other, and sayle soo in, unto the south end of the town, where the mils doe stand, then you shall see there upon the rocks two beacons, run betwixt them through at high water, untill you come within the towne, at the eastside, the shippes lye moored with soure cables, dry at low water, two fast on the towne, &amp; two upon the sand. Betwixt these two foresayd beacons, to the south∣wards of the town, and thereabouts, is the ground sharpe, rockie and stonie, therefore men must take heed not to stay there at low water, or to ground there, but within on the east side of the town it is cleane sandie ground, there may the shippes lye a ground without danger.</P>
<P>A little within, or to the southwards of the foresayd rock the little Bee, men may anchor in five or 6 fathom water at low water, so that the towet of Bore commeth little to the eastwards of the little Tower upon the poynt to the southwards of the Town, that road is called by the French La Ranse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Road La Ranse.</NOTE> there men commonly first anchor, and stay for high water, for to goe in about to the southwards of the Towne. It sloweth here at S. Maloes, &amp; thereabouts, seven fathom up and downe with an ordinary tyde.</P>
<P>From the west end of Sisember, lye off alsoo a great many rocks alongst to the westwards, more then a great shot off a cast peece, at the end of them goeth in the Wester-channell of S. Maloes, east and by north in. For to sayle in there, you must look out for a sharp lit∣tle Tower, that lyeth somewhat to the northwards or to the eastwards of S. Maloes, within the land called Pellemy, when you have brought that east and by north from you, then you shall see upon the shore right against it, a great black rocke, which for Blacke∣nesse sheweth it selfe without all the other rockes there∣abouts, and thereby is very easy to bee knowne: Bring that rocke &amp; the foresayd little Tower one to the other &amp; saile soo right in untill you come thwart of the Island Sisember, or els that the little Tower (upon the poynt to the southwards of the Towne) come to the Tower of Bore, to the eastwards of Saledoor, sayle then towards the roade of La-Ranse to the southwards of the little Bee; or els if it be high water, you may run in upon the markes, and then in about to the southwards of the Towne, as here before is sayd.</P>
<P>When you saile into this westerne channel, you shal leave on the starboard side a high rocke (called the Schoorsteen) with more other rockes to the westwards of it, which at high water are most of them over flowne. On the north side, that is on the larboard side, lye alsoo many rockes, whereof many of them are overflowne at high water, and also many remaine above water.</P>
<P>Yet a southerne channell<NOTE PLACE="marg">More, a Southerne channell.</NOTE> lyeth in by the land to the southwards of the rock of S. Antony, upon marks that men may see a stearne the ship, but it is not used but with small ships.</P>

From the eastermost Island lyeth off a fowle riffe to the southwards, upon the outermost end of that riffe lyeth a rocke, as a good marke for to sayle about the riffe. Northwest from the west-end of the seven Islands, lyeth alsoo a suncken rock, wich at low water may be seene. Men may alsoo sayle alongst by the coast from Port Blanck, within to the southwardes of the Green Island, and come out againe into the sea to the westwards: from thence northwest off into the sea, lye the Triacle Pots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Triacle. Pots.</NOTE> these are great feare full out-rockes, which lye spred wyde and broade westsouthwest from the seven Islands, and foure or five leagues a seaboard the land.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Triacle Pots and the seven Islands lyeth the River of Laminoe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Lami∣noe.</NOTE> to the westwardes of the Greene Island: For to sayl in there, men must take good heed of the northeast poynt, which is fowle.</P>
<P>Thwart of the seven Islands, upon the maine land, standeth a Church with a high steeple, called Our Lady of the Clearnesse, thereby men may know them.</P>
<P>Thwart of the Triacle Pots standeth alsoo a high Tower, thereby men may know when they are neere them, but it must be very cleare weather before men can well discerne it upon the land.</P>
<P>Hee that commeth by night or darke weather from
<PB N="24" REF="174"/> the Fourne, or Ushant, and is bound to Saint Maloes, let him not goe with a southerly winde, to the eastwar∣des of east-northeast, or northeast and by east with a westerly winde, so long untill hee hath the length of the Triacle Pots, that they bee on his broad side. The flood falleth southeast within the Triacle Pots and the seven Islands, and should by night easily draw a ship towards them. By day, or when there is sight, there is no such danger.</P>
<P>Within the Triacle Pots lyeth the tyde haven of Saint John de Doy, two leagues to the westwards of the Green Island, and two leagues to the eastwards of Morlions, men may sayle from thence through the rockes unto Morlions, and anchor in five and sixe fathom at low water.</P>
<P>To the westwards of the Triacle Pots lyeth a great rock, the easterne entry of Morlions<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morlions.</NOTE> lyeth from it south∣west and by south distant two leagues, but the westerne entry lyeth from it westsouthwest &amp; west and by south foure or five loagues, that goeth in by a great long rag∣ged rock. This entry men may sayle in south, &amp; south and by west, unto the castle of Morlaix;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morlaix.</NOTE> being about the castle they may run through the rocks againe to the eastwards, and runne out againe at the easterne entry northnortheast, and north and by east into sea, according as the tyde shall be, the flood commeth there out of the northwest.</P>
<P>If a man would goe from Morlaix to Morlions, hee may goe on east through the rockes, and so sayle to it: It is all broken land, and there remaineth at low water five fathom depth.</P>
<P>If you are bound to S. Paul de Lion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Paul de Lion.</NOTE> you must run right with the great rock, with the two horns or Sadle, and so close alongst by it: being past it, edge to the land upon the strand lyeth a village, called Plempoll, sayle right with it, &amp; alongst by it, to the eastwards of it goeth in the river. These are all tyde-havens, but betwixt the rockes of the Morlions, and the Islands Bay, it is at lowe water deepe enough for to save a ship.</P>
<P>The land of S. Paul de Lion is double land, upon S. Pauls Church stand two sharpe steeples. The Island Isle de Bas, lyeth thwart before it, upon it standeth two stakes, to see to a farre off like milles. Upon the east end of that Island lieth a very high ragged rock, when you are to the eastwards of this rock, you shall see two sharpe steeples a little one from the other, these are the steeples of Plempolle: you may also then see the Castle of Morlaix, lying southeast from you, upon a high rock.</P>
<P>The foresayd outermost long ragged rocke of Morlaix, lyeth from the top of the Island Isle de Bas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle de Bas</NOTE> east and east and by south three or foure leagues. Men may sayle alongst by the maine land within and through these rocks, untill they come to the seven Islands, they are all great bayes, where inmost places is good anchor ground.</P>
<P>Five greate leagues north and by east of Isle Bas and southwest and by west 27 leagues, from the Caskets, lyeth a dangerous rocke or Cliffe called Roche Blanche,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roche Blanche.</NOTE> and lyeth from seaven Islands westnorthwest 9 leagues.</P>
<P>Within the Isle de Bas lyeth the town of Roskow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roskow.</NOTE> you may sayle into the haven of Roskow on both sides of the Island.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the easterne channell, when you are passed by the high rocke with the saddle, or two hornes called Le Taureau, and come by the land, betwixt the east poynt of the Island, and the poynt of the maine land over against it, you must sayle still keeping the middle of the channell. It is in this channell 7 and eight fathom deepe. Being come within the poynt of the Island, you must runne in about by it, west &amp; by south, &amp; west on untill you come about halfe wayes within the Island, and anchor there in eight or nine fathom. And then Roskow shall lye south and south and by east from you.</P>
<P>If you will sayle into the westerne channell▪ you shall see to the westwards of it, close by the maine land two great long rockes. From the point of the maine land, a little to the eastwards of the eastermost long rocke, lyeth of a riffe from the land, which maketh the west side of the channell, you must runne in southeast betwixt that riffe and the west poynt of the Island, &amp; when you come within the poynt of the Island, you must edge up northeast unto the middest of the Island, &amp; anchor there as here before is sayd.</P>
<P>From Isle de Bas alongst to the Fourne or Ushant lyeth the coast westsouthwest 16 leagues.</P>
<P>From the Island Isle de Bas unto the Fourne, (the outermost or westermost end of the maine land of Britaigne) the course is westsouthwest, and west and by south thirteene leagues. About halfe wayes betwixt them both lyeth Obbevrack, or Abberwrack.</P>
<P>About a league northwest without the rockes of Obbevracke or Abberwracke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abber∣wrack.</NOTE> lyeth a rane of Rockes under water. They that by night wil saile or turne to windwards from the Fourne or towards the Fourn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fourn.</NOTE> let them not come thereabouts nearer the land then in 45 fathom.</P>
<P>A league to the eastwards of the Fourne, &amp; all alongst the coast even unto the Fourne, lye many long black ragged Rockes, in many places appearing like Villages, these are called the Ovens, within them on the maine land (which is not very high) men shall see (sayling alongst by them) many white sand-bayes, and here and there some little houses, whereby the foresayd land the∣reabout is very easy to be knowne.</P>
<P>The Fourne and Ushant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ushant.</NOTE> lye westsouthwest &amp; east∣northeast distant two great leagues. Ushant sheweth it felfe at sea at the south-end low, and at the north-end going up sloaping, upon the midst of it standeth a little flat Tower, by which markes it is good to be knowne.</P>

<P>TO the Westwards of the poynt of Beachy, thwart of the west end of the 7 Cleeves, right against the Chindle, where men run alongst by into new Haven, men may alsoo anchor in 7. 8 or 9 fathom.</P>
<P>A league and a half to the eastwards of the point of Beachy, nearest e. n e. from the poynt lieth a little sand, upon which there is at low Water and spring-tydes scarce two fathom.</P>
<P>At the west end of the seven Cleeves lieth the River of Cuckmer-Haven, or New-Haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-ha∣ven.</NOTE> which hath two entries, the westermost entry lieth in by the west land, but is not to be used, but onely with very small ship∣ping, it falleth altogether dry, the eastermost is com∣monly the best, and lieth northwest and by west in, there is at high water with a common tyde not more then seven, and with a spring-tyde, 14 or 15 foot water; within, the ships lye every tyde dry: But before the vil∣lage they remaine a float, there they moore with foure cables fast on 2 green shoares. Upon these entries men cannot well make any reckoning, they keep no certaine depth, when it bloweth a storme out of the south, they are oftentimes cast too with a chindle, and opened againe with a freshut.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shorum.</NOTE>Shorum is a tyde-haven, where is at high water and spring-tydes 18 foote water, but at low water there remaineth no more then 3 foot water, soo that then it floweth 15 foot up and down. With a common tyde at high water there is 12 foot and at low water 3 foot depth. The towin Shorum lieth a little English mile within the haven, ships (that draw but 8 or 9 foot wa∣ter) can lie a float a little beneath the towne at low water, or else they lye dry every where.</P>
<P>When you come from the eastwards from Beachy or New-haven along by the shoare, you may see open in∣to the Haven, before you come thwart of it: But com∣ming from the westward, you shall not see it open be∣fore you come right before it, because the west poynt lieth somewhat further out then the east poynt. From the west point runneth off a little tayle, but at high water you may runne in alongst over it, otherwise you must runne in by the east shoare. Upon the east poynt stand 2 beacons, which you must bring one in the other, &amp; run in so right with them untill you come by the n. shoare, and then in alongst by the foresayd north shoare.</P>
<P>At Shorum somtimes there are builded many great ships of 3 or 400 tunnes.</P>
<P>About sixe leagues to the westwards of New-haven lieth Arundell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arundell.</NOTE> a tyde-haven, where a ship may go in at half Flood, you must goe in thereby the west land north east in. In the entry it is two, and betwixt the two lands 3 fathom deep at high water: But within the Haven remaineth at low water 4 and 5 fathom: There you must anchor before the village.</P>
<P>Five leagues west s. w from Arundell, and 13 leagues west and by south somewhat westerly from Beachy, lye the bancks or shoals of the Owers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Owers.</NOTE> under water, a great league and a halfe a seaboard the land.</P>

They that sayle off from the haven of Shorum, and are bound to the westwards, must not go more westerly then s.s.w, untill they come in 18 fathom, before they set their course more westerly, for feare of this shoale. About an English mile n. w. from this foresayd shoale, lieth alsoo a sunken rock, whereupon at low water it is no more then 5 or 6 foot water.</P>

Or-else if you cannot see the Lyme-kilne, then keepe the Castle to the westwards of the Culver cliffe, untill that S. Ellens Church commeth a ships length without the poynt of the Island, goe then boldy northwest in, and you shall not come too neare the riffe; And then bring the square Tower betwixt the east end of Portsmouth, and the Castle: When the Castle to the westwards of Portsmouth commeth to the east side of the Wood, then you shall not (as here before is said) come too neare either the plate or the sand, to take any hurt of them.</P>
<P>When the eastermost white spot standeth a ships length to the westwards of the Castle, then you are to the eastwards of the riffe, and when the Culver cliffe is covered or hidden behind the, n. e. point of the Island, thē are you also within the riffe.

But when the foresayd square tower commeth to the west side to the foot of the Castle &amp; the Castle by west Portsmouth to the west side of the Wood, there it is deepe at low water upon the little plat 12 foot.</P>
<P>When the square Tower standeth betwixt the east end of Portsmouth, and the Castle even betwixt the Lyme-pit and the Tower, and the Castle by west Portsmouth in the west side of the Wood, there it is at high water, tenne fathom deepe.</P>
<P>When Saint Ellens Church lyeth southwest and by west from you, then lyeth the southeast end of the plate northeast and by north from you, and the west end north and by east.</P>
<P>From the poynt of the roade of Newport eastwards lyeth abroad sand alongst the shoale, called No mans-land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No mans-land</NOTE> which falleth almost dry at low water, it is so steepe, that halfe a cables length off from it, it is twelve fat∣hom deepe: upon the high land of Wight thereabouts stand two or three mills. If you come neare the shoare, that the foresayd mills bee hidden behinde the foresayd high land, you shall not misse to come a ground against that foresayd sand, but so long as you can see these mills you shall goe cleare of it.</P>
<P>The Roade of the Cowes is the best Roade in Wight.

<P>For to sayle in at the west end of Wight, you must runne right in with the Needles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sayl in at the Needles.</NOTE> (they are high sharpe Rockes as Masts lying at the West end of Wight) bring then the innermost poynt of Wight, or the Castle that standeth upon the chindle over against that poynt, cal∣led Hus castle a little without, or to the northwards of the Needles, sayle in there upon, untill you come to the Needles, leave them then on the starboard side of you, and run in within a cables length alongst by them for to avoyd the bancks which lye off from the chindle to the northwards of the Needles, of the west end of Wight almost to the Needles. Betwixt the bancks cal∣led the Swingels, and the Needles, it is not very broad, and at low water 5 fathom deep. When you sayle in here, you must cast your tydes well.

<P>For to goe into the roade of Torbay, you must bring the West poynt south and by east, and southsoutheast from you and anchor there in 7 or 8 fathom, you shall lye land-lockt for south and southwest windes. At the northeast side of the bay is alsoo a tyde-haven, before it, it is good anchor ground in foure or five fathom, according as you will lye neare or farre from the shoare.</P>
<P>Three or foure leagues southwards, or to the west∣wards of Torbay, lyeth the Haven of Dartmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dart∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh.</NOTE> which hath a narrow entry, lying in betwixt two high lands, upon each side of the Haven standeth a little Castle, in time of warres they were wont to shut it over with a chaine, on the Westside standeth a little Church on the high land. For to sayle in there comming from the Steart or from the westwards you must run in alongst by the wester-land, so farre to the eastwards untill you bring the kay of the village (that lyeth on the east side of the haven) in the middest of the entry of the Haven, and sayle so in, keeping the middest of the Haven be∣twixt the two lands, and you must bee very ready with the boat (if there should come any sore flangs from of the high land) for to row in. Being come in, edge over to the west-side, before the Brewhouse, and an∣chor there in ten or twelve fathom, or before the village on the east-side where you please.</P>
<P>At the east-side of the Range lyeth a suncken Rock, the marks for to avoyd it are these. To the eastwards of Dartmouth is a red poynt, which below by the water is black, and in the red lieth a white stone, when the white stone commeth over the black poynt, then are you thwart of the suncken rock, but if you see the kay of the village and doe as before is sayd, then you shall not come too neare that suncken rock to take any hurt of it.</P>
<P>Betwixt Dartmouth and the Steart, nearest to Dart∣mouth standeth a spire steeple indifferent high and white, called Tackman, that is a very good marke to know the haven of Dartmouth by.</P>
<P>The Steart<NOTE PLACE="marg">Steart.</NOTE> lyeth from Dartmouth southwest distant three leagues.

<P>A little to the eastwards of the westermost poynt of the Steart lyeth a haven, called Salkom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salkom</NOTE> when you come from the west, it sheweth it selfe open, the west side of it is ragged and the east side goeth sloping downe, close to the westpoynt lyeth a rocke, or a rane of rockes, there∣fore you must give it a good birth, &amp; leave the rockes on the larboard side: Further, you may see all breaks that can doe you hurt. Being come within the point, you can take no hurt of either of both shoares. Upon the barre or shoals of the entry, remaineth at low wa∣ter with a spring-tyde, not lesse then eleven foot water, &amp; again within it is at least three fathom deep.</P>
<P>Seven leagues to the westwards of the Steart lyeth the sound of Plymmouth, at the outermost east poynt of the sound lyeth a high round rock, called Mewstone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plym∣mouth Mewe∣stone.</NOTE> the west poynt is called Ramehead, betwixt them both goeth in the sound Plymmouth north north∣east in, it is broad and deepe. A little to the northwards of Ramehead is a faire sand-bay, where men may an∣chor close under the land, in nine and ten fathom. Two leagues south a little easterly from Ramehead, lyeth a Rock above water, called Eddystone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eddy∣stone.</NOTE> The poynt of Plymmouth lyeth from the Eddystone North and by east, and Northnortheast, distant about foure leagues. In the sound, by the land of Plymmouth, lieth a little Island, which is fast to the west side with a riffe or rane of Rocks under water, so that men must sayle alongst to the eastwards of it, whether they be bound into Catwater,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catwater</NOTE> or into Hamoase the west harbour. If you will goe into Catwater, then runne in betwixt the Island, and the poynt on the east side in with the land of Plymmouth, untill that you see Catwater open on the starboard side of you, goe then into the eastwards be∣twixt
<PB N="30" REF="181"/> the point of Plymmouth, and the foresaid east point on the starboard side of you, leaving the most part of the channell on the starboard side of you, until you come within the poynt, and anchor there right against that high steepe norther-land, there is at low Water with an ordinary tyde foure and five Fathom deepe.</P>
<P>When you sayle into Catwater, you must take heed, and give a good birth to the souther poynt of the entry of Catwater, for there lye off to the foresayd poynt, a ledge of Rocks under water, neare about two cables lengths from the Land, and upon the poynt of the ledge or shoale, lyeth a buye, where is at halfe flood about twelve foot water, which buye you must leave on your starboard side in going into Catwater, and when you have Catwater altogether open, you may run into the eastwards, leaving (in the entry of the harbour) two third parts of the channell on the starboard side, as before is sayd, because the south shoare is somewhat flat off, there lying a sandy bancke, which reacheth to the second poynt of the south shoare of Catwater.</P>
<P>A little to the eastwards of that foresayd little Island, lyeth a rocke under water, upon which is at low wa∣ter not deeper then two fathom. For to sayle within the Island, you may goe into the eastwards, or to the westwards of the rock according as occasion shall serve. If you wil sayle into Hamoase, to the westwards of the rock, then take the sounding of the Island in foure or five fathom at low water, and run in so by it, untill that the Fisher Village (lying to the northwards a little within the land) come in the west side of the valley on the north shoare, then are you to run through betweene the Island and the rocke, and to the westwards of the rock. Within the Island upon the land of Plymmouth, standeth a wall or hedge, when as you see that onend∣ling, and the chappel of the foresayd Fisher-village commeth to the north-side of the Valley, and Catwater commeth open; then doe you runne over the Rocke. Betweene the Island and the maine, men may anchor in twelve and thirteene fathom.</P>
<P>If you bee bound into Hamoase,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hamoase.</NOTE> you must runne in betweene the Island and the land of Plymmouth, and then in amiddest the channel betweene the two Lands, untill that the entry of Hamoase be open, runne then into the northwards, as the channel leadeth, until you come in about the west poynt, and anchor there in six∣teen, fifteen, and twelve, or ten fathom. In the narrow it is fifteene, sixteene, seventeene, &amp; also twenty fathom deepe, and betweene the Island and the maine, eight, nine, tenne, and twelve fathom.</P>
<P>About halfe a cables length to the eastwards of the Passage way going into Hamoase, lyeth a suncken rock under water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ger∣man a suncken rock.</NOTE> called the German, about two great shippes lengths from the shoare, and at low water hath not above foure foot water upon it. And when men doe come any thing neare this foresayd suncken rock going into Hamoase, either with the flood or the ebbe, the tyde wil set them right upon it, if it bee calme. Therefore to avoyd it, men must (with calme weather) give this foresayd suncken rock a good birth, untill they bring the houses of the Fisher-Village, (called the Stone-hou∣se) open of the easter-poynt of the Passage way, and then runne in over towards the north shoare, until they have hidden the Island in the foresayd easterne poynt of the passage way, for to avoyd a suncken Rock<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suncken Rocks.</NOTE> that lyeth off to the eastwards from the North poynt of the Beach on the West-side of the Passage way, a halfe cables length off, and then runne amids the channel into Hamoase. Upon this foresayd suncken Rock at low water, is not above 3 or 4 foot water.</P>
<P>In the sound of Plymmouth, not farre to the north∣wards of the Mewstone, lye two or three suncken rockes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suncken Rocks.</NOTE> upon which remaine at low water not more then three or foure fathom water, the markes of them are these: To the eastwads of Plymmouth standeth a Tower with a Mill, and to the Westwards of the fore∣sayd little Island standeth a Gentlemans house, when the little tower or turret of that house commeth over the poynt on the west side of the Island, &amp; the foresayd Tower and Mill to the eastwards of Plymmouth come one over the other, then are you upon the innermost suncken rocke or shoale, which it at low Water foure fathom deepe. But when the poynt of Hamoase commeth even without the poynt to the westwards of the Island, and the foresayd Tower and mill alsoo one in the other, Then are you upon the outermost rocke, where it is at low water and spring-tyde three fathom and a half deepe.</P>
<P>From Ramehead west &amp; by south five leagues, lyeth Foy, and betwixt them on the coast lyeth a little Island, a little to the eastwards of a poynt, called Talland-poynt, thwart of West-Louwe, called Louw-Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Low-Is∣land.</NOTE> you may anchor there to the easterwards of the Island in 5 or 6 fathom.</P>
<P>Foy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foy.</NOTE> is a broad haven, where a ship may go in at a half flood, at the east-side of the haven standeth a little church with a little steeple, &amp; on the west side a white church, somewhat greater then that upon the east land with a square steeple at the west end of it.</P>
<P>For to sayle into Foy, you must have at least a halfe flood, and runne in midst the channel betwixt the two poynts, and being come within, then chuse which side you will, but the most water is by the west land, be∣tweene the stakes and the Tower that standeth upon the west land. Being come within the Stakes (as you come in by the west land) then beare somewhat off pre∣sently from the west shoare, almost into the middle of the channell, nearest to the west shoare, untill you come before the Village that lyeth on the west side, there is a deepe docke, where a shippe that draweth sixteene foot water may lye a float at low water. In the sayd dock may 3 or 4 shippes lye.</P>
<P>If (when you come in by the east land) you desire to bee in the foresayd docke or poole, then saile in untill you come within the stakes, and then edge over off from the east-land untill you come nearest the west land, for to avoyd a Flat, which lyeth by the east shoare alongst the haven, and beginneth against the first house of the West-Village. If it should happen, that you could not lead it in with a saile, then let your anchor fall without the stakes, &amp; warp in with hawsers, untill you come into the foresayd poole.</P>
<P>You may also sayle so farre in, that you may see a wall on the west side of the haven, where lyeth a village behinde it. A shippes length to the southwards of that wall, it is good lying by the east land, being moored by foure cables, there may alsoo a ship ride a float that draweth sixteene foot water. You may also saile further in alongst by that Swach that lieth on the west side, wherein the mill standeth, but come not too neare the north poynt of the Swach, for there by it, lyeth a rock under water, being past that you may moore your ship in the middest of the channell, there is best lying for shippes that draw much water.</P>
<P>Foure leagues southwest and by west from Foy, lyeth the poynt of Dodman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dodman.</NOTE> &amp; two leagues to the westwards of it lyeth the Haven of Falmouth. The poynt of Dodman is double Land with a round hill, which to the westwards goeth sloping downe, somewhat towards the west end standeth a mill with a sharp tower, and some little houses upon the land, somwhat to the westwards, men may see the castle of Falmouth upon a round Hommocke against the high Land. This land is very easy to bee known when you come from the west, or from the Lizard.</P>
<P>Upon the west poynt of the haven of Falmouth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falmouth</NOTE> standeth a Castle upon the high land and in the entry nearest the west-side, lyeth a great rock above water, you may sayle about it on both sides, at the inner side of the east point lye also some rocks off from the shoare.
<PB N="31" REF="181"/> For to sayle in there to the eastwads, alongst by the fore∣sayd Rocke, you must runne in within two cables lengths, alongst by the eastland leaving the foresayd rocks on the starboard side, and the great rocke on the larboard side, &amp; so sayle right in with the high land that lyeth on the west side within the haven. Within in the haven standeth on the Land a white Chalkye spot, also a little wood of trees, keepe them over the North poynt of the foresayd high west-land, and sayle so right in with them, keeping them so untill you come neare them, you shall finde so at halfe flood, upon the shoalest, not lesse Water then five fathom, and that betwixt the foresayd Castle upon the west poynt, and the easter Castle that standeth on the eastside, within the haven, over against it, or a little within the Castles. When you shall then come by that foresayd high west-land, runne alongst by it, unto the north-end of the same, and anchor there in twelve, thirteene, or fourteene fathom. You may also from thence edge over towards the east land, &amp; anchor there under or behinde the banck; that lyeth off from the easterne Castle alongst the middle of the haven, in sixe, seven or eight fatham: the banck falleth almost dry at low water, and is soft ground, soo that the shippes sit in the oase, when they come there a ground.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the westwards of the foresayd great rock, you must take the sounding of the west land, where the Castle standeth upon, in five or sixe fathom, being somewhat within the rock, runne (as before is sayd) to∣wards the west-land. To the westwards of the rock, it is in that channell six and seven fathom deepe at halfe flood, but in the channell to the eastwards of the rock, seven and eight fathom.</P>
<P>Foure leagues south &amp; by west from Falmouth lyeth the east poynt of the Lizard, betwixt them both lyeth a haven, called Helford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Helford.</NOTE> which is little used for ships.</P>
<P>At the south-side of the haven lyeth a steepe poynt, and on the north-side a low sharpe poynt. Within the haven on the south-side, standeth a Gentlemans house beneath at the strand, &amp; upon the hill standeth a tuffe of trees, you must keepe these one in the other, and runne so amiddest the channell into the entry of the ha∣ven. On the north side stand also 2 or 3 trees, these come a masts length to the westwards of a little house that standeth in a white sandy bay, there upon you may sayle in alsoo amidst the channell; it is a short in-let, being come within, you may anchor in six or seven fathom. Upon the south side standeth also a sharpe Tower, and upon the north side a little Castle upon the steepe land.</P>
<P>The Lizard hath three poynts, the northermost is called the Blacke-head, from that to the second the coast lyeth southwest and by west, and alongst to the third about westsouthwest, or west and by south: from the second or middelmost poynt, lye to seawards some rocks a cables length, or a cables length and a halfe off, called the Staggs.</P>

<P>Foure leagues to the eastwards of Hartland poynt eastsoutheast from the south end of Londey, lyeth the sound of Biddeford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biddeford</NOTE> being a broad haven, where many ships doe sayle in and out. A little within the mouth of the haven, it divideth it selfe into two rivers, upon the westermost on the starboard side lyeth Biddeford, and upon the eastermost on the larboard side lieth a town called Barnestable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barnstable</NOTE></P>
<P>From the poynt to the northwards of Biddeford Ha∣ven, unto Ilfercombe the course is e.n.e foure leagues, that is a haven where remaineth at low water 3 or foure fathom deepe. Before the haven is also good roade, in 8 or 9 fathom at halfe flood.</P>
<P>Eleven or 12 leagues to the eastwards of Ilfercombe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ilfercom∣be.</NOTE> lie two little Islands, about two leagues north &amp; south one from the other, called the Holmes, the northermost is called the Flatholm, and the southermost the Steep∣holm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flatholm Steep∣holm.</NOTE> betwixt Ilfercomb &amp; the Holms (somewhat nea∣rer the Holms then Ilfercomb, lieth a little towne called Mynehead, where many ships do lade.</P>
<P>In the fareway betwixt Ilfercomb &amp; the Holmes, on the English side; on the one side, and the bankes on the Welsh side; on the other side, in the middest of the chan∣nell it is deepe 30. 25. 20. 18. 16. and 15 fathom, the nearer the Holmes the shoaler water. When men come from the westwards within the Island Londey, then they may see the Land on both sides, to wit, of England and Wa∣les. The English coast even from the C. of Cornwall to the Holmes is altogether cleane, but the coast of Wales is most all foule and shoaly, from the Island Caldy unto Bristow, with many bankes, sands, and riffes that lye off. The Holmes and the Island Londey lye west southwest, and east northeast, distant 19 leagues.</P>
<P>He that will sayle from Londey to Bristow, must run alongst by the English coast, untill that he come within the poynt of the Naes, for to avoyd Naes-sand, and then forth alongst through betweene the Holmes, leaving the Steepholme on starboard, and Flatholme on the larboard side.

<P>He that commeth off from the Naes, and is bound to Bristow, must stand over to the Steepholme, and run alongst to the northwards of it. It lyeth from the Naes eastsoutheast about seven leagues.</P>
<P>For to sayle through between the Holms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail through between the Holms</NOTE> the right &amp; best fareway, you must sayle nearest the side of the Flatholme, there it is deepest, with an open wind men may sayle alongst soo neare by it without any hurt, that they may cast with a stone upon it. Within, or to the eastwards of the Holmes, lyeth shooting off from the eastland, a great shoale, lying off with a great tayle to∣wards the west which (comming from the west) men might easily sayle within. For to avoyd it, you must set the Flatholme (when you are passed it) southwest from you, &amp; keepe it standing soo, untill that you shall have sayled about a great league, looke out then for a little Island, that shall then at the east shoare lye neere about thwart from you, upon it stand two mils, and above upon the maine land standeth one mill. When the mill that standeth upon the high land commeth to the west end of that foresayd Island, you shall bee past the fore∣sayd tayle of the English grounds, and cannot sayle within it, goe then e.n.e. alongst by the English grounds, which are flat, soo that you may sayle alongst by them upon your lead in 3 or 4 fathom soo neere as you will. When then the mill that standeth upon the high land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Markes the Eng∣lish ground.</NOTE> commeth betweene the foresayd two mills which stand upon the little Island, then shall you bee altogether past the English grounds, run then boldly towards the English coast, and so close alongst by it, as you please, towards Passis or Portshut poynt. From the Flatholm to Passis poynt in the right fareway, it is deep 14 and 15 fathom. The Welsh side you must shun, and take very good heed of it, because it is very uneven and full of steep bankes that are needle to, which at many places do fall dry at low water, you may not come neerer that coast then in 12 fathom, for (sayling towards it) you shall have at one cast ten fathom, and before you can heave the lead againe, you shall sit fast, alongst from Flatholm till you come to Bristow. About Passis poynt men do anchor in Kings road<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE> which is between the poynt &amp; the river of Bristow, neerest the river there is good clay ground in 8, or 9, fathom. They that are bound into the river are brought in by the Pilots. Men may from thence also sayle in alongst by the coast to the River of Severne, which is also like the River of Bristow, a faire River to saile into.</P>
<P>For to saile from Bristow to Londey, you must goe away from Passis poynt w. s. w. untill that the Flatholm doe come to beare southwest from you, or els untill that the three foresayd mills upon the south land doe stand a like farre one from the other, to wit, that which standeth upon the high land, doe stand in the middest betweene the other two, sayle then right with the Flat∣holme, &amp; very close alongst to the southwards of it, and being passed it, goe then forth westsouthwest unto the Island Londey.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="190"/> Within it is three, foure and five fathom deep. From the east side lieth a rane of rockes, at least halfe wayes over in the havens mouth, a little without the rocks it is at low water no more then five or sixe foote water, but at high water it is deepe enough.</P>
<P>Foure leagues to the eastwards of Iochull, lyeth Don∣garven haven, betwixt both lyeth an out point; a little to the eastwardes of it standeth a high blacke Tower, called Ardimore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ardimore</NOTE> which may bee seen wel foure leagues at sea, within it is a bay, which is a good roade for westerly windes in seven or eight fathom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dongar∣van.</NOTE>Dongarvan is a narrow tyde-haven, the mouth off the haven is ful of rockes, and at lowe water it falleth drye, men must goe in there at high water, and runne in through betwixt the rockes, it lyeth in northnorthwest, within it is deepe enough. The towne Dongarvan lyeth upon the west side of the haven. From Dongarvan to Waterford are eight leagues.</P>
<P>Within Dongarvan, northnorthwest landwards in, lyeth the mountaine of Sleges, which men doe cal the high mountaine of Dongarvan, or Cape de Quin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Quin.</NOTE> or Caray Quin, it shewed it selfe with three exceeding high hommockes, farr above all other landes, there∣abouts, men may see it at sea alongst a great part of the south coast of Ireland.</P>
<P>When you shall have that mountaine northnorthwest from you, and sayle in right with it, you shal fall right with Dongarvan.</P>
<P>When you shall have it north from you, and sayle in right with it, then you shall fall with Iochul; being northnortheast, then you shall fall with Corck, but when it shall be n.w. and so run in, you shall fall with Waterford.</P>
<P>The haven of Waterford<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water∣ford.</NOTE> lyeth about five leagues to the westwardes of the s. east poynt of Ireland, being called Carnaroort, the coast betwixt both lyeth east∣northeast and w. s. w. and sheweth it selfe in the ossing, within the land, with high hilles two and three double one above the other, but by the sea side it is all low land, where you may see many flat Towers upon it, as you sayle alongst by it. The east poynt of the haven is a low rock poynt, but it is cleane, upon it standeth a high white flat Tower, called the Tower of Waterford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tower of Water∣ford.</NOTE> which you may see farre off at sea, and is a perfect mark to know this haven by, there stand many more flatt Towers to the westwards alongst the coast, but this is better to be seen then all the rest, because it is white and higher then the other. The west poynt is a high and fowle poynt, there lyeth a shoale soutsoutheast off into sea, from it the channel is broad and cleane, without it, it is eleven and ten fathom deep, &amp; in the havens mouth seven fathom, and somewhat further in sixe fa∣thom, it lyeth in north and north &amp; by west, within this river within the east poynt is a good roade in foure or five fathom, a league within the rivers mouth there lyeth on the west side a steepe poynt, from thence be∣ginneth a shoale lying to the northwards alongst the shoare unto the steep poynt of Passage, and shooteth over from that poynt with a tayle, towards the east shoare. Passage is a village where men passe over, lying on the west side of the river, a little to the northwardes of the foresayd steepe poynt.</P>
<P>Betwixt that village, &amp; that point on the west side is a good roade very fit as wel for them that are bound out, as for them that are bound up. In sayling up you must take heede of a little shoale that lyeth off by castle (standing on the east side of the river) somwhat thwart over, the River downwards, at high water there is no more then two foote water upon it, a man that looketh for it, may see it, it is also flat that a man may sound it. About halfe a league northwards up the river from Passage, there goeth another river westwards up to Waterford.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt the haven of Waterford and the poynt Carnaroort, lye 2 little Islands about half a league from the shoare, called Saltees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sal∣tees.</NOTE> the southermost is the greatest and lieth distant from the Tower of Waterford, directly cast almost three leagues. Betwixt these two Islands, you may sayle through in five, sixe and seven fathom, but you must keep neerest the smallest or northermost Island, for to avoyd some sunc∣ken rockes that lye at the north end of the great Island, and at low water are drye.</P>
<P>From the northermost or smallest Island of the Saltees towardes the maine land, lyeth off a ledge of rockes where men were wont to goe over on foote, but now may sayle over. For to sayle betwixt the Saltees and the main land, you must leave two thirds of the distance of water from the Islands; and one third part from the maine, and you shall have at low water about two fathom deepe.</P>
<P>About a half league without the southermost Island of the Saltees, lyeth a rock above water, called Kinbegh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kinbegh,</NOTE> and s. west about so farre from it, &amp; s. &amp; by west from the south end of the Saltees lyeth a suncken rock, called Kimor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kimor.</NOTE> of the bignesse of a ship, it cometh with halfe ebbe even above water, it is so steepe that a man may lie with a shipps side against it, and have 14 fathom water, so that a man (without any danger) may sayle alongst by it, as neere as he will. A man may also (if need require) sayle through betwixt Kinbegh and the greatest Island of the Saltees, but a seaboard of all is best and securest.</P>
<P>To the eastwards off the rock Kinbegh, southeast from the greatest Island of the Saltees, lye also some suncken rockes called the Frailes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Frails</NOTE> which may be seen at low water, there men may also sayle through within them. Northeast from the Saltees lye also rockes, the southermost is called the Tuns, and the northermost the north rocke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tuns and northrock</NOTE></P>
<P>Northnortheast from the greatest Island of the Saltees, or from Kinbegh, and s. west and by s. from Carnaroort, lyeth one rock above water, called Blackrock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blackrock</NOTE> that is cleane and cleare round about, so that a man may sayle round about it freely, without feare of danger. But a quarter of a league eastwards from it, lyeth a suncken rocke called the Barrel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barrel.</NOTE> of that a man must take heed.</P>
<P>Under the Islands of both the Saltees, a man may ride, under the greatest at the n. west side neerest the north end: the marke or knowledge of the road is, a black rock like a boat turned upside downe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der the Saltees.</NOTE> right against that you must anchor in seven, eight or nine fathom, there it is good sandground, and landlockt for an eastsoutheast, southeast and a south winde, a southwest winde bloweth alongst the shoare. If you anchor neerer the shoare in 5 fathom or there about, there it is rough ground.</P>
<P>Under the smallest Island a man may ride at the east side in 7 or 8 fathom, so that the north poynt of the Island lye n.n. west from you, there you shall lye neere the land-lockt for s. west and n. west windes.</P>
<P>From the point of Waterford the shoare lyeth to the eastwardes, within the Saltees, eastnortheast, until Car∣naroort, with many bayes, and all oasie and black sandy. A man being acquainted there, should at a need in many places finde good roads, there is nothing that can hurt you except a little fowle place a little to the. w. ward of Carnaroort close by the shoare.</P>
<P>He that commeth out of Waterford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to a∣voyd the fowle grounds of the Sal∣tees.</NOTE> and will goe about to the southwards of the Saltees, must not go more easterly then e.s. east, for to go cleare of the fowle grounds, wich lye to the southwardes of the Saltees, and when the Saltees shall be north of him, then lyeth the course from thence to the Tuskar, directly northeast, or a little more easterly. But for to go alongst without the Tuskar, a man must goe at least northeast and by east to goe cleare of him.</P>
<P>The Tuskar<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tuskar.</NOTE> is a great black smooth rock, lying like unto a ship turned up-side down, but is about twice so great, at the north side of it lye also two small rockes under wa∣ter. The Tuskar lyeth from the poynt of Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noore s.e.

<P>Southeast and by south about ten leagues from the Tuskar, lye two little Jslands close one by another, about foure leagues from Grasholme, called the Smaels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smaels.</NOTE> at high water &amp; spring tydes the water floweth over them, the northermost is called Scakum, &amp; the southermost is called Kamey, there lye off in the sea 2 little shoals from them, the one north-northwest and the other south∣southeast. Betwixt the Smals and Grasholme lyeth also a ledge of rockes, which at low water may bee seene above water. It is not without great danger to goe through betwixt them both, especialy with calmes, by reason of the tyde that runneth very strong there through; an eastsoutheast moone maketh high water without the Smaels.</P>
<P>From the Tuskar east and by south about eight leagues, lyeth also a great rock, with many small rockes round about it, called Mascus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mascus rock.</NOTE> Hee that commeth from Eng∣land and will sayle towards Ireland, must take great heed thereof, especialy when as through westerly or northerly windes he shall be driven a little to the east∣wards of the course.</P>

There is very good riding.</P>
<P>From Carnaroort to S. Margets bay, the shoare lyeth along northeast one league, it is betwixt both rocky and fowle, but the fowle ground lieth not farre off at sea. For to keep cleare without it, you must keepe so far off the shoare that you may see the topps of the double land within about the cliffe land &amp; you need not feare, but if you come so neere the shoare that the double land within bee covered of the foremost cliffe land, or that thereby it get out of your sight, you shall then surely sayle upon the foresayd rockes.</P>
<P>By S. Margets Bay upon the foresayd land standeth a Gentlemans house in the hills, when you have brought that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the mill that standeth within, one in the other, then you may goe into the roade, and leave the rockes which lye above water halfe waies over the bay, either on starboard or larboard of you, anchor there in five or sixe fathom, sandy ground.</P>
<P>About s.f.e. from S. Margets Bay off at sea, lyeth a sunc∣ken rocke, that at low water lyeth dry, called Caliach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caliach.</NOTE> for to avoyd it, take heed unto these markes: when you come from Carnaroort, and have Black rock with the great Island of Saltees one in the other, and keep them so, and then sayle on northeast, you shall goe right upon this suncken rock. For to goe to the southwards of it then keepe black rock with the smallest Island of the Saltees one in the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks for Caliach.</NOTE> or els for to goe to the north∣wards of it, keep Blackrock without or to the eastwards of the great Island, and then you shall not need to feare any danger of this suncken rocke.</P>
<P>From S. Margets bay to the point of Grenore, lyeth the coast northeast halfe a league.</P>
<P>The poynt of Grenore is not very high, but steep and flat on the toppe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe of Grenore.</NOTE> off from it goeth a shoale about a quarter of a league into sea east and by south, of very rocks and stones, the which at low water falleth dry a good wayes off the shoare. The ships comming from the southwards that are bound for Dublin or washford, goe in commonly betwixt the Tuskar and the foresayd rockes of Grenore, for to come within the banck or sands. Oftentimes they goe into Waterford for to hire a pilot to bring them up. For him that will be his owne Pilot, wee will describe all the markes that are to be taken heed of, as well for to sayle into Grenore, as also into the deep or haven of Washford, as they are now at this time, and hereby doe advise men that they doe not alwayes continue so, because by reason of the floods, the channell doth shift, and stretch it selfe out more northerly, and also waxeth deeper.</P>
<P>Comming out of the sea about a league or two neere unto Grenore, you shall see the high ragged double land high above the poynt of Grenore, which (as is aforesayd) is not very high, but flat on the top. By that sayd high ragged double land within, men do know the entrance of the channell of Washford. When men doe come from the southwardes and the eastwardes. When you have sight of the poynt of the Grenore, you may boldly goe right with it, untill that sayd double land doe shew it felfe, by estimation, but a mans length above the poynt of Grenore, a sheweth this figure.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<P>The high land over the poynt of Grenore.</P>
<P>The stat foore land of Grenore.</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Then are you farre enough from the shoare, not to bee in any danger of the shoale of Grenore: Or els you may fit you selfe that you come no neere the shoare then in sixe or seven fathom: but yet for need a man may borrow of the shoale in five fathom, or foure fathom &amp; a halfe, but you must also take heed that you goe not so farre off from it, that you have more the eight or nine fathom depth, otherwise you should come to neere the banck that lyeth to the northwardes of the Tuskar, which on the inner side is very steepe and needle too, upon it is no more then twelve foot water, and close by it ten fathom deepe. If that you keepe the foresayd ragged high land (as is before sayd) a mans length above the land of Grenore, and so sayle to the northwardes, so long untill you bring that same high land without or to the northwardes of the steepe poynt of Grenore, then are you yet right against the shoale &amp; must yet sayle to the northwardes, keeping the mill that standeth next unto the point of Grenore, so that you may see the top of it even right over the steepe poynt of Grenore. When you keepe it so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greenbay</NOTE> you shall not be in any danger of the shoale or riffe. Then as soone as you see a castle (which standeth a little without the strand) come without the point of Grenore, then may you boldly sayle towardes it, by your lead, into the Bay of Grenore.</P>
<P>The sayd mill stands upon the land of Grenore, a little within the land, that may serve for a mark for not to come too neere as well to the shoare as also to the shoale or riffe, for if you come not so neere the shoare that you loose the mill out of your sight, but keep so farr off, that you keep sight of it, then doe you keepe farre enough from the shoare, and from that rocky shoale or riffe. Then when the mill shall come to lye southwest &amp; southwest &amp; by south from you, then you are even passed the shoale or riffe, go then n.w. and by west, and northwest, according as the winde and tide shall be into the Bay of Grenore.</P>
<P>Or els you may observe another marke: Sayle on so long north, untill that you see a long black house come out to the westwards of Grenore, upon the low land, the which sheweth like a black rock upon the land: then you may luff on towardes the shoare in foure or five fathom alongst by the riffe, and run in so untill that you get six or seven fathom, and presently after∣wardes shall be eight or nine fathom deepe, but then afterwardes is it shoale by little and little, as you come neere the shoare.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="191"/>
<P>If you have a large winde: then sayle so long to the northwards untill you see another little black house come out without the point, sayl then unto it, you shall (so doing) have no danger of the riffe.</P>
<P>In the Baye it is shoale water, you may lye there so neere the shoare as you please, in six, five, foure, and also three fathom, and there you can get a Pilot to bring you to Washford.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sai∣le out off Grenore bay.</NOTE>For to sayle out of the Bay of Grenore, you may run out so close by the shoare, that you may see but the wings of the mill over the Foreland, and so goe on east southeast into sea alongst by the riffe, or according as the winde and tyde shall bee, so long untill that you may see thee roofe of the mill, then you may goe larger, and by little and little goe more southerly, and then you shall see it ripple upon the riffe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sai∣le too washford</NOTE>For to sayle out of the Bay of Grenore towards Wash∣ford with a ship that draweth little water, you may boldly runne alongst by the shoare, and sayle through betwixt the Haenmans path and the Souder, that is a channell where at high water and ordinary tydes is eight foote water; but with a spring-tyde there is ten foot water.</P>
<P>The Haenmans path is a dry sand, which maketh the south side of the channell of Washford, lying off from the Souder.</P>
<P>The Souder that is the south poynt of the maine land of Washford haven.</P>
<P>But if your ship goe deeper, then you must (sailing out of Greenbay) goe further off from the shoare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schoale washford</NOTE> for to come without the sand that shooteth off from Haen∣mans path, yet you must also take heed that you goe not to farre there-off, for if you come so far off in ten fathom, you shall come too neere unto the banck that lyeth without, which is on the inner side very steep and needle too, therefore go no further from the shoare then in seven, eight or nine fathom, but comming somewhat more northerly about Haenmans path, then you may well goe off into ten and eleven fathom; also you may not come neerer Haenmans path then in seven fathom.</P>
<P>If you desire to be upon the barre of Washford and to leave the shoale of Haenmans paths, to wit, to goe to the northwards, then take heed unto these markes: At the north side of the channell of Washford lyeth a high hill with a round hommock, which is to bee seen over the Foreland, and a little castle in the low land, a little above the strand, appearing as if it were against the land; bring that round hommock a little to the northwards of the castle, and sayle so in, but bring not the hommock within or to the southwards of the Castle, for then you should bee in danger of the sand of Haenmans paths, unlesse it were by neede, and with a bare wind, then you might borrow so neere to bring them one in another, and so to sayle in, but it is best to keep them somwhat out one from another, to wit, the little Castle to the southwards of the hom∣mock.</P>
<P>If it should happen that you could not see these fore¦sayd markes well, nor discerne them, then you may goe about the sand of Haenmans paths by your lead in seven fathom without any danger.</P>
<P>For to know then when you are far enough sayled to the westwards, or are past Haenmans path, and are open before the channell, you shall see in the south-land a little Castle that standeth about foure leagues in the land within the strand, in the side of the high land of Washford, about southwest and by west from you, when that shall bee upon that poynt from you, and that it standeth betwixt the two northermost little sand-hills that are upon the foote strand of the Soudre (which is upon the south shoare) then are you past Haen∣mans paths; sayle in then upon the marks of that little Castle, and the little sand-hils over the barre of the haven; there it is at high water about sixteen foot deepe.</P>
<P>As soone as you are past the outermost flat at the poynt of Haenmans paths, you shall goe somewhat neerer to Haenmans paths, although it bee very steep, that the tyde doth not bring you upon the tayle of the north-ground where the mast standeth, that is a fore∣mast of a ship that is there lost, and lyeth there suncken into the sand, by the sore-mast the north grounds are very steep and needle to, but without and within very flat going up.</P>
<P>In this channell &amp; upon the Barre an east and west moone maketh highest water: but the flood runneth yet afterward a half tyde strong by the channell to the northwards; so that when it is highest water in the channell and upon the Barre, yet runneth the tyde thwart over the channell, therefore a man must keepe him so neere to Haenmans paths, as is said, that is the cause that tayle of Haenmans path is cast up still more and more to the northwardes, and that the channell now lyeth out more to the northwards then it was w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to doe: And yet hereafter it is like that it will stretch it selfe more to the northwards, so that the foresayd m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rkes (by all likelyhood) wil not continue certaine alwaye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Even as the flood after the highest water, runneth yet a halfe tyde or 3 houres strong (in the channel) to the north∣wards, so also runneth the ebbe a half tyde to the south∣wards after the lowest water, but not so strōg as the flood.</P>
<P>Being over the shoalest of the Barre, you shall have three &amp; a half, and foure fathom, and in the channell betwixt the north grounds and Haenmans paths against the mast 5, fathom depth, runne in by Haenmans paths, all alongst untill you come to the foot strand, &amp; then edge over to the north shoare, for to avoyd the grounds which lye to the westwards above the Soudre, you may borrow of the shoale on the north side by your lead, into ten or eleven foote, according to the draught of your ship. In the right deepe of this edging over, you shall have at high water, fifteene foote depth.</P>
<P>The marke of this edging over is a white little castle that standeth on the north side of the haven in the valley of the Land, when that commeth over the steep poynt of the innermost Island to the two that lye by the nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shoare, and seemeth to be about a mans length hig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, then you may boldly run in n.w. with it, untill th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little chappell within the Land, and to the southw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds of Washford (a little or about a cables length to the northwards of that other forenamed little Castle on the north side of that high ragged land, that hath served <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r a marke to sayle over the Barre) commeth over a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack hommock that you may see upon the high land, a little to the southwards of the Castle of Washford, when you shall have brought these marks one in the other, edge then over again to the south land upon the marks for then you shall be above the sands of the Soudre; and with that course also shall not be in danger of the taile of the sand that shooteth off from the point of Passage, which is on the north side, but it is there broad and lar∣ge, that a man may there turne to &amp; againe, it is al∣together shoale water, of 10 &amp; 10 foot &amp; a half at high water.

<P>To the southwards of the sands, that lye to the westwards or above the Soudre, goeth a dreeke through, there is more water then in the edging over to the

The marke sor to sail through there, is: That you keep the highest hommock of the hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ragged land (behind Washford) right over the castle of Washford▪ but there can be nothing gotten by it, with say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing through there, in regard you must nevertheles go over the shoalest, after that you are passed the sands of Soudre, to wit, over the foresayd depth of ten &amp; 11 foot.</P>
<P>For to sail out from Washford, with a ship that goeth deep, you may not lade deeper then ten foot, or ten foot and a half for to come over the foresayd shoale; you shall then sail about to the northwards of the shoale that lyeth within, or to the westwards of the Soudre, &amp; goe in and anchor betwixt the shoale and the Soudre, there you shall be landlockt for all windes, except for the southwest winde you have little shelter, you shall there∣fore bring out your best anchor, in the southwest, and the other in the northeast, because that the winds that come out of the south w. over the land, doe not put you upon the north grounds. There at the Soudre, you may take in the rest of your lading, it is a league from the towne.</P>
<P>If you wil anchor before the Barre of Washford for to stay for the tyde, you must anchor a little to the north∣wards of the Barre, &amp; go off somewhat until you have 8 fathom, there it is cleane sandy ground.</P>
<P>In the night there are two fires made upon the Soudre for the Fishermen for to come in by night, by the Haen∣mans paths, he that will sayle in by them, must keepe the highest fire a little to the southwards of the other, for to avoyd the north grounds.</P>
<P>Besides the deepe alongst by the Haenmans paths, the Fishermen have a little channell that goeth out close by the north shoare, it is there about 6 foot deepe at high water.</P>

<P>When you have sayled to the northwardes alongst by the shoare, about two leagues from the Barre, you shall see three white spots or rockes in the sand-hill, a little to the northwardes thereof standeth a peece of a wall, much like a pillar of a Church: Right against this pillar, a great English mile from the shoare, beginneth a sand, called the Rusch and Ramme, lying from thence alongst the shoare to the northwardes, you may sayle about it on both sides, but it is best to keepe the shoare, and to runne through there within in sixe or seven fathom, as is sayd out of feare of the outtermost banckes, which are very steepe, and therefore cannot bee sounded; There∣fore men doe seldome use to sayle there a seaboard of this sand.</P>

This Channell lyeth in northwest.</P>
<P>For to sayle from Glaskarrick to Dublin, run all alongst by the shoare (which is somewhat full of Bayes) and keepe you (as before) in eight, seven, or 6 fathom. Two great leagues to the northwards of Glaskarrick lyeth a sand, a great halfe English mile from the shoare, called the Glaskarmen, the ground is very uneven be∣twixt both.

<P>At the north side of the poynt of Arkelo is a faire sand∣bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baye Arkelo.</NOTE> there is a good anchor ground, and all over good riding in 8, 7, or 5 fathom, in this bay are good store of herrings caught.</P>
<P>Right against Arkelo runneth also a channell through the banckes into the sea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into the channell before Arkelo.</NOTE> For to sayle in there out of the sea, looke out for a round hill within the land; bring that westnorthwest, or west &amp; by north off you, &amp; sayl then in there boldly, keeping it so. But if you bring the round hill west of you, and sayle so in, you shall sayle upon the poynt of the north groundes, it is in that channel about seven or eight fathom deepe.</P>
<P>About an English mile to the northwards of the poynt is the river of Arkelo but very shoale, at high water there commeth no more then sixe foot water.</P>
<P>The coast of Washford unto Wickelo lyeth most north &amp; by east, a little more easterly: But he that will sayle without alongst by the banckes or sandes, must not goe more northerly then northnortheast, for to avoyd the grounds which lye about Wickelo, 3 leagues off from the land. And to the southwards the south grounds lye scarce a league from the shoare, there not long since a pilot keeping bad reckoning run without the sandes alongst north and by east, &amp; sayled thwart of Arkelo, behind a taile of sand that lyeth off from the north to the southwardes, &amp; he lost his shippe.

If you keepe the poynt of Brahead a little without Wicklohead, then you can take no hurt of it, or if you keep the high inner land, so that you may even see it above the land of Wicklo, and goe not altogether hidden behinde it, then you goe there without it in 5 fathom. The poynt off Wicklo is steepe &amp; stony with a double top little hill, within standeth a little chappell, when you can see that through the saddle off the hill, then you are right against it, and have it on your side; the village of Wicklo lyeth to the north∣wards off the point in the Bay, there is a little haven, which at high water hath ten foot water.</P>

When you are within the sunc∣ken rockes, you must runne over to the souther shoare, and in alongst by it, untill you come before the town of Carlingford, and anchor there in six, seven, or eight fathom, so shallow as you will; you may sayle in upon the oase and save a ship without anchor or Cables.

<P>From Strangford Haven to the Northwards lieth the coast forth n.n.e. one league unto a point which some doe call the point of Arglas, others the point or head of Molines; from thence falleth away the coast unto the Bay of Knockfergus northnorthwest.</P>
<P>By the foresaid point of Arglas or Cape of Molines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Point of Arglas. C. de Mo; lines.</NOTE> to wit, to the northwards of it, two little miles, lye two great rockes: the southermost is called the Southrocke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">South∣rock.</NOTE> it lyeth about two mile, to the Southwards of the Northermost, called the Northrocke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">North∣rock.</NOTE> From the south end of the southrocke lieth a ledge of rockes at the least two miles off, also one from the northeast point a great waies northeast off into the sea. The north rocke is a great plate of rocks, whereof many at high water are under water. There goeth also from it a foule ledge off unto the land, so that a man may hardly sayle through betwixt the rocks and the maine land, except a man be extraordinary well acquainted. But betwixt the north∣rock &amp; the southrock goeth a faire broad Sound through, where men may well turn too and again, and at many places may anchor, it is all over good clean sandy ground, 6, or 7, and 8 fathom deep.</P>
<P>From the east side of the southrocke unto the Islands at the east point of the bay of Knockfergus, called Kop∣pen, or Kopland Isles, the course is North northwest or somewhat more northerly, about six leagues: for when men sayle from the east side of these Islands to the southwards, with a s.s.e. way, they goe farre enough without the north and Southrocks. There betwixt them both lie divers more little Islands, rocks, and suncken rocks, &amp; shoals, for the which men must take good heed when they will come neare by the shoare.</P>
<P>The Kopland Isles lye about an English mile from the land, they are upon the off side to seawards, cleane, but from the inner side there goeth off some ledges and foule ground, in the mid-way there going through it is 5 &amp; six fathom deepe, but it is best to goe without, except for them that are well acquainted. The n. point of Knock∣fergus, lieth distant from the Copland Isles 3 or 4 leagues n.w. or somwhat northerly, for which a s.e. course from the north point towards the fore said Islands, that goeth farre enough without them.</P>
<P>The bay of Knockfergus<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of Knock∣fergus.</NOTE> is a great broad Sound; About 3 leagues inwards in the Bay w. from Copland Isles, is the road before Knockfergus, there is good anchor ground in 3 fathom and a halfe. Somewhat more further out towards the n. point also on the n. side of the bay standeth a Castle, called Mousehils Castle, by it is a sandy bay, where is good anchorage, as well for great ships as small, for the n. and the n.w. winds, but a south∣west winde maketh a bad road in these places.</P>
<P>A little to the northwards of the North point of the bay of Knockfergus, lieth a little Island called Kow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kow island.</NOTE> from thence lieth the Coast of Ireland forth northnorth∣west, about 9 or 10 leagues unto the Islands of Raghleens. Betwixt them both lye the 9 Maydes one great league without the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Maids</NOTE> and two great leagues to the north∣wards of the Bay of Knockfergus, they are great Rocks, that lye but little above water, or low rocky little Islands, and a multitude of rocks under water about them, that lie off so far to the north north east, that men cannot come neare them within 5 or six English miles. There goe some Creekes through the soule grounds, where men (for need) might sayle through, but it is no wisdome to go about it, when there is no need, and that men can do better. Not very long since, there came a man (by night unacquainted) there in, and ranne through onely upon the sight of the breaches of the water, and got through without any hurt, but not without great feare and danger. He that commeth off from the faire Forland, must (at least) goe South east and by east, sor to runne alongst cleare of these foule grounds. From the west side also lieth off a little tayle of a ledge of Rockes towards the land. Further, it is there cleane, that men may sayle through there within, but men must not come nearer the Maydes, then about halfe channell betwixt them and the maine, but the maine land so neare as they will, which is both cleane and cleare, with many Bayes, where men may every where anchor, yet here and there lie some Rocks, but they are all above water: There is nothing that can hurt you, but men may easily see it.</P>
<P>A great league to the northwards of the north poynt of the Bay of Knock fergus, and a halfe league south southwest from the Mayds, lieth a haven called Old-fliet<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old fliet.</NOTE> For to know it when men come from the Northwards, they shall see two flat little Towers, the one somewhat higher then the other, like as if men saw a ship with maine sayle &amp; foresayle, without toppe or toppe-sayles: these stand upon the northside of the Bay.</P>
<P>At the south point lieth a small round little Island or rock called the Knee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island Knee.</NOTE> a speciall marke for to know this Bay; Men run in there amidst the channell. But when you come from the southwards, and get sight of the little Island Knee, then run in close about it.</P>
<P>From Old-fliet to the northwards unto faire Forland, the coast is very cleane, that you may sayle close alongst by it, boldly without any feare, except you runne farre off from land, without the foresaid Maydes towards the Scottish coast.</P>
<P>Faire Hid, or Faire Forland<NOTE PLACE="marg">Faire Fot∣land.</NOTE> is the outermost north east Poynt of the maine land of Ireland, and lieth a little to the southwards of the Island Rachleens, so that this point and the east point of Rachleens lye neare about south and north one from the other.</P>
<P>At Rachleens, or Faire Forland the north east point of Ireland, come Scotland &amp; Ireland nearest one to the other. The Rachleens is an Island that men may sayle round about, either to the Northwards or to the South∣wards, as they will according as it happeneth best conve∣nient with winde and tyde. At the southwest side is a faire bay, where is good lying almost for all windes. When men come from West it seemeth to the south∣wards of the Rachleens to bee close without any opening, because the eastermost poynt of Irelands Faire Forland, lyeth somwhat further out, behinde the Rachleens, but when they come neerer betwixt them, sheweth it selfe open by little and little. On both sides are the shoares flat and cleane, so that men may anchor there where you wil, either by the coast of the maine land of Ireland, in 8 or 9 fathom, or in the bay under the Jsland in cleane sandy ground. Over against the Rachleens, close by the maine land, lyeth another little high Island, called the Lambs<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambes Island.</NOTE> or sheeps Island, to the southwardes of it betwixt it and the main, men may not sayle there about it, but betwixt it &amp; the Island Rachleen it is broad enough.</P>
<P>From the Rachleens unto the Skires Portrush, the course is w. s. w. distant 7 leag. About 2 leag. to the e. wards off it, in the maine land, lyeth Porto Belletrie, a bad roade for great ships, the ground is there fowle and sharpe.</P>
<P>Betwixt Porto Belletrie and Skires Portrush, neerest unto Skires Portrush, lye the Chickens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chickens.</NOTE> these are sunc∣ken rockes, which may be sayled about on both sides, for to come to anchor under Skires Portrush.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skires. Portrush.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Skires Portrush is a rocky Island, it hath on the south side a faire bay, where you may lye in sixe and seven fathom, cleane &amp; sandy ground land-lockt for all winds, except for the eastnortheast winde, which bloweth alongst the shoare there open in. For to come under this Island from the east, you must goe close alongst by the shoare off the maine land, for to shun these foresayd suncken rockes the Chickens. It is there all over cleane and cleare: or els if you were minded to goe without, or to the southward off the Chickens, for to come under the Island, you must shun the East poynt
<PB N="50" REF="197"/> of the Island, because of a suncken rocke that lyeth a little off from the east poynt of the Island. At the northwest side of this bay is also a small narrow channell, where you may sayle through.</P>
<P>A little to the westwards of Skires Portrush lyeth the Bant-haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bant-haven.</NOTE> there alongst you may sayle up unto the new Towne Colran, it is a bad channell to come in, as well by reason of the strong freshoale that commeth out, as also because it is very shoale: with shipps that draw 8 foote water, you must have at least 3 quarters of the flood before you can goe in.</P>
<P>Three leagues n. west and by west from Bant-haven, or west and by north from Skires Portrush, lyeth the ha∣ven of Loughfoile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lough∣foyle.</NOTE> before it, lyeth a great plate of sand called the Touns, which lyeth from the west poynt of the haven a great wayes to the northwardes off from the shoare, when the winde is out of the sea, it breaketh very much upon it, with small ships that draw little wa∣ter, men may sayle into Loughfoile haven at high wa∣ter to the southwardes of the Touns, betwixt the Touns and the souther-poynt, called Magillions poynt; but it is there very uneven, and at full sea there cometh no more then eight foote water, but alongst to the westwards of the Touns, it is very deepe, men may sound about the Touns on the off side in foure fa∣thom.</P>
<P>For to finde the Channell that lyeth into the west∣wardes off the Touns, (comming from the east, or alongst by the Touns) you must looke out for a little sandy Bay, that lyeth on the west-side, even within the north-poynt of the river under the high land; bring it soo, that you may see it open of the foresayd north-poynt, and sayle in there upon, untill you come by the land, and then runne in alongst by it southwest untill you come right against Greencastle. If you come from the west or the north, you may boldly without feare runne alongst the shoare, &amp; about the poynt upon your lead, without comming neere the towne, you may see any thing that might doe you hurt, comming by Greencastle, there may you anchor so that you may see Withcastle without the poynt of Green-castle, there you may lye within the Towns, sheltred for windes out of the sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Road in Lough∣foyle.</NOTE>For to sayle up from Green-Castle, you must runne up alongst by the west shoare by your lead, and shunne the little sandes that lye here and there alongst that side, until you come past With-castle, right against the three trees, there is the ordinarie road.</P>
<P>Betwixt Green-castle and With-castle neerest unto Green-castle goeth a Creecke ot Slencke through the grounds, unto the easterne shoare, which is as deepe or deeper then the right fareway unto With-castle. When men come off from Green-castle, they must take good heed not to goe farre off from the westerne shoare. lest they fall into that Creeke.</P>
<P>How men shall saile from the foresayd roade forth up unto the Towne Derry, they may perceive or marke by the card.</P>
<P>From Lough-foile-haven unto the Islands Enesterhul<NOTE PLACE="marg">Islands Enester∣hull.</NOTE> (by some called Monsterhul) the course is northwest foure or five leagues, these are small black Islands or rockes, not very high above water, and lye a little off the northermost poynt of Ireland, called Enistom, a high plaine land, and very good to knowe for him that hath once seen it. Betwixt the Islands and the point men may saile through, but not-without great danger for them that are not very well acpuainted with it, because off much fowle ground and shoals that lye betwixt them both. Under the foresayd poynt Eniston, on the west side, men may anchor for easterly windes, or els to stoppe the tyde.</P>
<P>From the Islands Enesterhull unto Lough-Swilly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lough-Swilly.</NOTE> of some called Locksillie, the course is southwest 5 leagues, that is a faire haven. For to sayle in there: men must shunne the west side, and goe in alongst by the casterne shoare: The land about Lough-Swilly is the highest land of the whole north coast of Ireland, and thereby it is also very good to know, for those that (comming out off the north) do fall with the lands there abouts.</P>
<P>Foure or five leagues westsouthwest, or somwhat westerly lyeth a large broad haven, called Sheepeshavē, but it is at some places foule ground, within it men may lye landlockt for al winds. The west poynt lyeth out, called Hornehead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horne∣head.</NOTE> or Cape de Horne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape de Horne.</NOTE> upon it is a hill with two hommockes in fashion like two hornes and there after the poynt is named.</P>
<P>At the west side of this poynt, men may ride and anchor within the rockes for easterly windes. Betwixt Lough-Swilly &amp; sheepshaven lyeth also a Bay, where men may anchor, but the ground is not very cleane, and right against it in the offing, halfe a league from the land, lyeth a ledge of rockes, which at high water are under, and at low water lye above water, may (for need) run through betwixt it and the land, but without it is best and surest.</P>

Three or foure leagues to the northwards of C. de Telling lyeth an Island, called Raigleene borne.</P>
<P>At the Cape Telling lyeth a little Island, halfe a league from land, men may saile through betwixt the Island and the cape, boldly without any danger.</P>
<P>To the southward of C. de Telling, to wit, betwixt the Cape and the Stagges of Broadhaven, lyeth the land with a great bay, where in lye many good Havens, as Tilling-haven, Kilbegh, Dungall, Ballashaven, Slego, Endrigo and Moye.</P>

<P>Kilbegh, or Kalebegh is also a faire round bay, but it is very narrow at the comming in of it: When men are a little from the shoare, it seemeth to bee all close with∣hout any opening. About halfe a league to the westwards of this bay, aquarter of a league from the land, lyeth alit∣tle Island, which is very low &amp; plaine at both ends going plaine downe, that is a good mark to know this foresayd bay, men may also saile through betwixt the Island &amp; the maine, if they will.

When you shall be come in anchor where you please in 5, 6, 7, or 8, fathom, so shoale or deepe as you will, on the north side within the bay stands a little Castle.</P>
<P>About a little league to the eastwards lyeth another Bay within some rocks, called Mackswyns bay;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mack∣swyns bay</NOTE> but it is not to goe in, except men be very wel acquainted, they must go betwixt the rocks in untill they bee gotten in, there they may save a ship without cable or anchor.</P>
<P>A great league to the southwards of Kilbegh, lyeth a long lying out poynt, called S. Johns poynt<NOTE PLACE="marg">S.

Betwixt that rock, and the poynt of S. Johns point, men may sayle boldly through, it is there cleane and cleare.</P>
<P>About 2 great leagues to the eastwardes of that foresayd point S. Johns point, lyeth the Haven of Dungall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dungall∣haven.</NOTE> into the southwards. For to saile in there, you must first shun the easter shoare, which is very foule with dry plates and Rocks. When you are come right against a little castle that standeth on the north side, right against it lieth off a little riffe from the shoare, that you must avoyd also. And when you are come about the poynt of that riffe, you must goe over again to the northside, for the south side is there slat and shoale Betwixt Saint Johns point and Dungall-haven alongst the coast is all over good anchor ground.</P>
<P>The Haven of Moy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moy.</NOTE> hath at the comming in a broad bay, in it lye some rockes. For to sayle in there, you must leave them all on the west side, that is, on the starboard side, &amp; run towards little sandy Island, that hath at the north end a little riffe, you must goe into the westwards of it, and leave that Island on the larbo∣ard side. Even within that foresayd Island lieth another little round green Island, that must bee left on the starboard side, so soon as you shal be right against it, you must let fall your anchor, for a little further it is shoale and hard sandy ground, the greatest anchor must be brought towards that foresayd long small Island, &amp; the small anchor towards the little greene Island, it falleth there at low water allwayes dry. If you will goe from thence before the Town Moy, you must light your ship to 8 foot, for to come through betwixt the long small Island, and the s. grounds, there is at high water with an ordinary tide no more then 9 foot water; being come over the neck, you shall come into a poole before the towne Moy, there you may ride a float at a low water.

<P>FRom Slynehead untill you come before the Bay or great inlett of Galloway the course is south∣east nine leagues, where lye three great Islands, called the Islands of Aron,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slands of Aron.</NOTE> the southermost is greatest, the channell betwixt the northermost and the middlemost, is called the sound of S. Gregory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Grego∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies sound</NOTE> which is on both sides cleane without any foule ground, so that men may turne in too &amp; againe from the one Island to the other, without feare of taking any hurt. The north side of the middlemost Island is nothing else but faire steep rocks: when you are come within the Islands, you must shun the middlemost, because of a little riffe that lyeth off it.</P>
<P>Men may also sayle to the northwards of the north∣hermost Island, into the great Bay of Galloway, likewise also to the southwards of the southermost, to wit, through betwixt the southermost Island, and the maine land, but that Island is foule at the south end of it, and therefore you must runne in alongst close by the south shoare, or at least leave two third parts of the channell towards the Island, as well in sayling in as sayling out.</P>
<P>Somewhat within the Islands, on the south side lieth a high black point, called Blackhead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blackhead</NOTE> you must beare in to it, and alongst by it in, whether you come in at the souther channell, or through S. Gregories sound, or else in at the norther channell, for the north side of the bay is foule and rocky. About 2. great leagues n.e. from Black-head, lyeth an Island, called Motton-Ile, under it on the east side you must anchor in a poole, in 5, or 6, fathom.</P>
<P>You cannot sayle furthet up to the northwards into the River with shippes, but onely with boats. A north∣east and southwest moone maketh there full sea, and it floweth there so strong in the baye, that the rockes which at low water are above water, at high water you may sayle over them; at low water of spring-tydes, the grounds fall dry w.s. west from Motton-Isle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motton-Isle.</NOTE> a great league &amp; a halfe off, most all rocky and foule ground.</P>
<P>When you sayle from Blackhead towards Motten-Island you must take heed of the north side, and edge over most towards the south side. About halfe wayes betwixt them both, lyeth a plate or ledge nearest the north side, you must goe in alongst by it to the south∣wards.</P>
<P>From the Bay of Galloway to Lupishead<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lupis∣head.</NOTE> at the n. poynt of the Haven of Limbrick, the course is s. s. west, 11 or 12. leagues. About halfe wayes betwixt them both, lyeth a little Island that is foule round about with ledges of Rocks that lye of to seawards a league &amp; a halfe a seaboard the land.</P>
<P>To the southwards of the poynt Lupishead goeth in the Haven of Limbrick.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haven of Limbrick</NOTE> Foure leagues eastnortheast within the foresayd poynt, lyeth an Island, called Seatrick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seatrick.</NOTE> you must sayle alongst without it to the south∣wards, &amp; leave it on the larboard side in sayling up. At the east side of that Island is a good road. About halfe wayes betwixt that Island and Lupishead, lyeth a shoale which you must shun, and sayle alongst to the south∣wards of it. From the Island Seatrick unto Limbrick, are more 12, or 13, leagues, first from thence to the Island Quoine 4 or 5 leagues, there are two little Islands, you must sayle close alongst to the northwards of them: from thence eastnortheast unto a great rock, called the great Beefe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great and little Beefrocks</NOTE> and then southeast unto another great rock, called the little Beefe.</P>
<P>When you are come before the towne in the Haven, you must make fast on the Castle with three or foure Cables. For there goeth a very strong tide as well of flood as of ebbe. An eastnortheast Moone maketh there full sea.</P>
<P>From the Haven of Limbrick to the haven of Smerrick<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smerrick</NOTE> the course is southwest eight er nine leagues, betwixt them both lyeth the coast with a gtear Bay, where in lye some little Islands, called the Hoggs.</P>
<P>A little to the eastwards of Smerrick lieth Sinbrandon∣hil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sinbran∣donhill.</NOTE> a very high hill, which lyeth in hight very much above all other lands thereabouts, they that come out of the sea from the westwards, shall see that hill first before any other Land, and thereby easily know it: Men may see it at sea in the offing. 12. 14, and sometimes 16 leag. off, according as the weather is cleare.</P>
<P>Foure or 5 leagues westsouthwest from Smerrick, a little off from the land lye 4, or 5, Islands, being high round Hills and rocks called the Blaskeys,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blaskeyes</NOTE> with some other rocks and little Islands about them. The Sound betwixt them and the maine land, is called the Sound of Blaskeyes, lyeth through nearest n.n.w. and s.s.e. Hee that is bound to the Northwards, may anchor at the south side before the sound for westerly &amp; northerly winds, and not be in-bayed upon any lee shoare: For if the winde shift easterly, hee may either goe through the sound, or else: goe about a Seaboard the Blaskeys. If the wind shift westerly or southerly, he may run through the Sound, &amp; further his voyage. There runneth through a very strong tyde, as well of the flood as of the ebbe, which must be considered.</P>
<P>Six leagues to the southwards of the Blaskeyes lye three great Rockes called the Skellocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Skellocks.</NOTE> the eastermost about a league, and the westermost two great leagues a seabord the land, when you come from the southwards &amp; see them first, they shew like sayles of ships. Betwixt the Skelloekes &amp; the Blaskeyes goeth in a great broad Bay deepe into the land, called Dinglebay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dingle∣bay.</NOTE> with divers havens in it.</P>
<P>About a league and a half from the Sound of Blas∣keyes lyeth a haven called Ventrie, a great league to the eastwardes of it another called Dingle, or Dingle Couch, it lyeth north and by west in at the west poynt of it lyeth a rocke called the Crow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Crow</NOTE> which is clean round about, so that men may sayle round about it on both sides, without taking any hurt, at high water with spring tydes, it floweth even under water. This haven of Dingle and the Skellockes, lye north east and by north, and southwest and by south distant eight leagues.</P>
<P>Northeast from the Skellockes, southeast from the Sound of Blaskeyes, and south and by east from the Ventrie, lyeth a haven at the east end of the Island Valentia, called Begenny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Begenny Haven.</NOTE> which lyeth eastsoutheast in, you must give the east poynt of the Islands a birth off, because it is fowle, and lyeth a good wayes off: there lyeth also a suncken rock on the Island side, which you must take heed of when you are come within the entry of the haven, you must goe east and by north unto the road; which is right against a red cliffe that lyeth on the south side.</P>
<P>The Skellockes and the Cape Dorsey lye northwest and southeast, Six leagues a sunder, betwixt them both goeth in also a great broad Sound, northeast in, where∣in lye many Islands, havens and roads.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bull, Cow Calfe rockes.</NOTE>Whithout the Cape Dorsy lye three great rocks, the outermost or the westermost is called the Bull, the middlemost is called the Cow, and the other the Calfe, they are clean round about, so that men may sayl there through between them, without feare of any danger, there is nothing that can hurt but men may see it.</P>
<P>About six leagues eastsoutheast from C. Dorsey lieth the poynt Mizanhead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mizan∣head.</NOTE> betwixt them both goeth in a great Bay or river deepe into the land (with divers havens &amp; roades) called the Bantry.</P>

<P>From Sheepshead to beerhaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beerhavē.</NOTE> the course is north and by west, or somewhat westerly about two great leagues, it goeth in between an Island on the east side, and the main land towards C. Dorsey on the west side, it is about a great musket shot Broad, the foresayd Island on the east side is called the Island of Beer-haven and is about two leagues long. For to fayl in there you must keeep the mid way, in the entry of the haven it is clean, without any fowle ground: after you are come in, there standeth on the larboard side a ruined castle, and a little further are two little rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road in Beerhaven</NOTE> close one by the other, betweeen these 2, little rivers stand some Fisherhouses. Men may saile into the foresaid little rivers, they are deepe enough, but commonly men doe anchor before them, or by that fore sayd ruined castle, or els somwhat further in, it is all over good anchoring, and cleane ground, except right against the foresayd little rivers, lye some rocks, about the middle of the channell, which at high water are under, and at low waterlye above water, these onely must be shunned, but men may goe on either side of them. Somewhat further in the Bay standeth another castle, called Oldcastle, from thence men may sayle alongst to the northwards of the Island Beer-haven, and come out to the eastwardes into Bantry. The Sound on the north side of the Island is large, broad cleane, 13. 12, and tenne fathom deepe. The east poynt of the Island is a sharpe poynt, and very fowle, there lyeth of a ledge of rocks, where of some lye under water &amp; some above water, at low water but the side of the mayne is cleare &amp; cleane. In this entry lye also 2 great rockes high above water, but clean round about, men may run through between these rocks, or to the south∣wards, betwixt them and the foresayd ledg of rockes or also to the northwards alongst betwixt them and the maine land, as well in comming in as in sailing out, there is no danger more then men may see.</P>
<P>From Beerhaven to the north poynt of the Island Whiddy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Whiddy</NOTE> lyeth the Bantry e.n.e. and northeast and by e. 6 or 7 leagues: over against Beer-haven in the middest in the farreway, it is deepe 40, 36, and 30 fathom, within the Island, 15 and 16 fathom, but further in towards the Island Whiddy, it is againe 20 &amp; 25 fathom deepe: men may sayle round about the Island Whiddy, (which is about a league long) but to the northwards it is best.</P>
<P>For to sayle in about to the northwards, or to the east∣wardes, men may goe in close by the north or east point, but a little within the point, lyeth alittle ledge of rockes, a little musket shot off from the shoare, which at high water lyes under but at halfe ebbe beginneth to come above water, that onely is there to be shunned, being passed that, you may anchor all over. About that fore∣sayd poynt lye two small Islands, by the greater men may sayle alongst on both sides of it, either within it or without it, untill you come before a Gentlemans-house which is white, upon the Island Whiddy, and anchor there against it in 3 or 4 or 5 fathom, so deepe or so shallow as men will, according as men desire to ride neere or far from the shoare, it is there all over clean ground.</P>
<P>He that will sayle into the s. poynt of the Whiddy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sai∣le in to the south∣wards of Whiddy.</NOTE> had need be very well acquainted it is there to the south∣wardes betweene the Whiddy and the maine land, at most places fowle and stony. From the west side of the Whiddy, lye also some fowle ground &amp; rocks, somewhat off the Island to seawards, some above, and some under water.</P>
<P>To the southwards of the Whiddy upon the maine land standeth a Friery or Abbey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Abe∣by</NOTE> called by the Irish the Abbey, right against it▪ is the common road, &amp; it is very good ground in 4, 5 or 6 fathom, according as you shall ride farre or neere to the shoare, to the northwards lyeth a little Island so low in the middest, that at a spring tide the sea floweth over, and devideth it in two.</P>

He that will sayle through on the inner-side, had need to be very well acquainted. The foresayd haven of Long-erf lyeth n. n. west: Even within it in the entrance on the starboard side, lyeth some fowle ground, wich at low water (at the Spring tydes) may be seen drye, these must beshunned, or els it is there within all over good anchoring and good ground, there is no more danger, but men may see it.</P>
<P>When a man is neer the Island Whiddy, about the middest of the Bay, he cannot see the land without the Island Beerhaven on the west side of the Bay, because it falleth a way so alongst to the westwardes.</P>

In the mouth of the haven lyeth a suncken rock, neerest to the east side, and within in the middest of the haven lyeth a rocke, which at high water lyeth under, &amp; at low water lieth above water, there is nothing els that can hurt. A little to the east∣wardes without the haven, lyeth another rock sixe or 7 shippes lengths from the shoare.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sai∣le through within the Islands of C. Cleare.</NOTE>To the northwards of the Island of the Isle Skercke, men may goe to the westwards through betwixt Isle Shercke, and the Island Spain, and come out againe into sea by C. Cleare, but it is to bee done onely with small shipping, and yet not without danger. Betwixt Isle Sherke and Spain, is at halfe flood not more then 12 or thirteene foote water. At divers other places betwixt these Islands, it is rocky and shoale, so that it is not good to goe through within, except men bee very well acquainted, and yet at high water and spring tydes.</P>
<P>A little league too the eastwards of Baltemoore lye the Stagges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Staggs.</NOTE> an English mile from the shoare, they are five or sixe high steepe rockes. When men come from the eastwards alongst by the shoare, and get first sight of them, they are like unto some spirie towers together, men may sayle through betwixt them and the maine land, it is there large and broad enough.</P>
<P>Northeast about 2 leagues from the foresayd Staggs, lyeth Castle-haven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castle-Haven.</NOTE> without it on the east side lyeth a little Island, you must leave it on starboard side in sayling in, and another little flat Island on the larboard side, that lyeth so close to the land, that at low water men may goe dry foot over from it to the maine land. Whithin the haven standeth a little Chappell, when you will sayle in there, you must run in right with it, close alongst by the foresayd little Island on the east side: When you are come in, thwart of the Chappell, you shall see a Castle on the west side, over against that Castle you may anchor in 12 fathom.</P>
<P>From Castle-haven unto the Oldhead, the coast lyeth most eastnortheast and w. s. west, but C. Cleare and the Oldhead lye northeast and by east, and e. n. east distant 14 leagues.</P>
<P>About halfe wayes betwixt Castle-haven and the Old∣head lyeth a high poynt, called by the Irish, Kedonete∣do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kedone∣tedo.</NOTE> there by it on the west side is a good haven, called Clandore:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clandore.</NOTE> For to sayle in there, you must run in alongst close aboard by that foresayd high land on the east side; for to shun a rane of rockes that lyeth on the w. side, and lyeth off somwhat towards the east side, when you are come in, you may anchor before a Castle in 5, or 7 fathom.</P>
<P>The Oldhead or C. de Velho, is a poynt that lyeth out farre without the other land, the outermost south end of it is very high and steepe, when you are come alongst the shoare from the east or from the west, and see it first, it seemeth to bee an Island, upon the top of it standeth a ruined castle with three Towers, whereof the middlemost is the highest. On both sides of this outlying poynt men may anchor so deepe or shoale as they will.</P>
<P>About two leagues north and by east from that point lyeth the haven of Kinsale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kinsale.</NOTE> lying in northnortheast, you may sayle in there, keeping the middle of the channell, there is no danger, neither without not in the harbours mouth, but one suncken rock close by the east poynt. When you come in from the Oldhead, or from the southwardes, and you keep an old ruined castle (that standeth within the haven on the east side) even with∣out the Innermost east poynt of the haven, then you shall not come neere that rocke to take any hurt of it. About a great halfe league to the eastwardes or the havens mouth, lye two great black rockes, the one somewhat further from the shoare then the other. When you come from the eastwardes, and you will goe in close about the east poynt, and you keepe the south∣ermost (that is the greatest) right on the east poynt, then you shall go through betwixt the suncken rock and the poynt: But if you keepe the northermost (or the smallest) a little without the foresayd poynt, so long un∣till you have brought the foresayd old ruined Castle, without the innermost poynt, then you shall goe alongst without it, and then in the midst of the channell alongst by the easterne shoare. A little past that foresayd old ruined Castle, standeth a Castle on the west side upon a poynt, there lyeth off a shoale, which must be shunned, &amp; therefore you must keep close alongst by the easter shoare, until you be gotten about the shoale of the Castle, &amp; then westwardes up unto the Kay of Kinsale, there you may anchor in eight or nine fathom, and lye landlockt for all windes. The towne Kinsale lieth a little to the northwardes in a bay, where it is oasie soft ground part where of falleth dry at low water.</P>
<P>Foure leagues to the eastwardes ef Kinsale, lyeth the haven Corck, betwixt both about a league to the west∣wardes of Corck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corck.</NOTE> you shall see (sayling alongst the coast) two steepe hommockes like Towers in the land, not farre one from the other: these are notable marks for to know the coast. When you are thwart of the eastermost, you may see the havens mouth of Corck, that lyeth in n. northwest; within it is wide and broad, and goeth up into the land with a broad river. On the east side, somewhat within is a poynt, where lyeth off a ledge of rocks, which must be shunned. There over against on the west side, somewhat farre in, lyeth another point with an old ruined castle, there also lyeth off a shoale, to the northwardes of it, men goe about to Corck. Within that Castle lyeth a little tyde haven in a sandy Bay. Within the haven lyeth an Island, where men doe sayle round about, &amp; at the south side there of may ride. It is in this Haven of Corck at lowe water, 7, 8 or ten fathom deepe.</P>
<P>A little without the east poynt standeth an old ruined Castle upon the low land, and somewhat further east∣ward, a square Tower in a valley. A league to the east∣wards of the havens mouth standeth a Tower upon a high poynt, close to the water side, with ten or twelve thatcht houses by it More over, a league futher east, by a smooth poynt, lyeth a long rock growen about with greene, upon the east side of that poynt standeth a flat tower, further, it is to the eastwards all low land, unto the poynt of Jochul.</P>

Matthewes point, so long, untill that the mill upon the north-land come to the northwards of the trees, then you sayle alongst to the southwards of the foresayd rock, and so doing, you can take no hurt off it, but if you bring the south end of the Mollens neare or to S. Matthewes poynt, you shall not fayle to sayle upon it.</P>
<P>For to sayle to the northwards of the foresayd Rocke, you must runne from S. Matthewes poynt alongst by the North-land, and keepe the southermost Mollens hidden behinde the great Rocke that lyeth off from S.

For to sayle forth alongst to Brest (being past the foresayd rock) you must run forth within two cables lengths alongst by the north shoare. A little within the east poynt off Cordon, or Claesdownes, lyeth a rane off Rockes, about the middest of the chan∣nell in the mouth of Brest-water, which at low water lye above water, and at high water are under water, called the Baginne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baginne.</NOTE> you may runne alongst on both sides off it, but to the northwards of it, is best, when the south poynt of Brestwater commeth over the poynt off Cro∣dan, then are you thwart of the foresayd Bagyne, which lyeth about two cables lengths from the north shoare, runne alongst to the northwards of it: When the Brest commeth without the poynt, sayle then soo right to it, you must anchor there with an anchor to seawards in eight or nine fathom, and with a cable a shoare fast on a tree: When you come within the Bagyne, you may edge up to the eastwards, or to the southwards before the river of Landerneau or Lefou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lefou.</NOTE> and anchor there under the south-land, in ten, twelve, or thirteene fathom. Before the little towne old Croidan. Brest-watet, or the river of Landerneau, lyeth in most eastnortheast, and it is Pilots water, hee that is bound in there, may take a Pilot to bring him in where hee desireth to bee: It floweth there with an ordinary tyde, three fathom up and downe, a southwest and by west, and northeast and by east moone maketh there full sea.</P>
<P>If you come to anchor within Brest, you must pay for anchoringe ten soubs, and for it you shall get a ticket off freedome. If it should happen that you should loose your shippe upon Britaigne, you might there with challenge your goods, else they are unfree.</P>

<P>Over against Bartrams bay lieth Croidan<NOTE PLACE="marg">Croidan.</NOTE> or Claes∣downes from S. Matthewes poynt, southeast distant about 3 leagues, it is a great bay. For to sayle from S. Matthewes poynt to Croidan, you must keepe the southermost Mullens even without the black Moines (that are the Rocke without S. Matthewes poynt) and go away east and by south, and e.s.e. untill you come before the bay, and may see open into it, then you shall see a Chappell, or little Church stand upon a chindle, run in right with it, anchor thereabouts, in 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, fathom, there is the best road.</P>
<P>The Mullens<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mullens.</NOTE> are the rockes which lye there to the southwards of Ushant, and to the westwards from Saint Mathews poynt. Betwixt them and Ushant lyeth a channell northeast and southwest through, which is in different large and broad, and deepe enough, there remaineth at low water 6, and 7, fathom water. Hee that commeth from the northwards, and cannot sayle a weather of Ushant and the Mullens, by reason of the flood may run through here, or he that commeth out of the sea, and with northerly winds, cannot sayle a weather off Ushant, may with a floud run through here, and so further his voyage, when men runne through here, either in or out, and keep the middle of the channell betwixt both lands they can take no hurt.</P>
<P>From S. Mathews point to the race of Fontenay, or the Keyser and Lavender, the course is south and by e. 6 leagues, betwixt them both lye divers, rocks where of men must take good heed, as the Hen with the Chic∣kens, the Collier, the Falconers, Scheminckelborrowes and other more. The Hen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henne</NOTE> with the Chickens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chickens</NOTE> and the middlemost Falconer or Foukenisse, lye from S.

<P>The Falconers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Falkoners</NOTE> or Foukenessen lye from the west Poynt of Croidan about w.s.w. an English mile. The innermost or southermost Falconer<NOTE PLACE="marg">The south¦ermost Falconers</NOTE> lyeth from the northermost s.s.e. about a halfe league, or two shots off a cast peece, and from Croidan s.w. &amp; by south, &amp; is coverd at high water. North n.e. a cables length from it, lyeth another suncken Rocke, which at low water may even be seene. To the westwards of the northermost Falconer lyeth also a suncken rock which at low water may even be seene.</P>
<P>The Hen<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hen</NOTE> lyeth from the Falconers w.s.w. about 2 cables lengths, or a shot off a cast peece, it is a round sharpe rocke, it is round about it deepe and cleane, in 6 and 7 fathom. The Chickens<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chickens.</NOTE> are two sharpe little roc∣kes, which at low water may even bee seene, and lye about the shot off a Base northnorthwest from the Hen, and west from the northermost Falconer.</P>
<P>The Scheminkel broughs<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schemin∣kelbo∣roughs.</NOTE> lye to the southwards off the Falkoners, men may run through betwixt them in ten fathom, to the point of Croidan, there is good road and anchor ground.</P>
<P>If you will sayle from S. Matthewes poynt to the Race of Fontenay, you must goe away south and by east, and bring the mill off Fenestiers, which standeth upon the east poynt of Conquet-haven, over the poynt off Saint Matthewes, a little to the westwards off the Abbey, and keepe them so standing so long as you can see them, and you shall not come to neare the foresayd Rockes, to take any hurt off them. When as then you come to the Keyser and Keyserinne, first give the Keyser<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keyser</NOTE> a birth, because off some suncken Rockes which lye off from the East side of it under water. From the southwest side of the Lavender runneth off<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lavender Race off</NOTE> a soule ledge of rockes, cal∣led the Calfe, there the tyde falleth very strong over it, with very great rippeling. This Channell off the Race of Fontenay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fonteney</NOTE> lyeth through betwixt the Keyser and Lavender s.s.w. &amp; n.n.east He that will sayle through here, must be very careful to cast his tides well, for it runneth most thwart over this Race, so that with a southwest wind, and an outfall or ebb, and also with calmes, it is very dangerous to come into this Race.</P>
<P>A little to the southwards of the Keyser, lieth the east end of the Seames,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</NOTE> and lye from thence at least three or foure leagues w.n.w. into sea. A great league northwest from the west poynt off the Seames, lyeth a suncken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock, where of men must take heed.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="210"/>
<P>And westsouthwest about two leagues from the Seames, lyeth a row of rocks, like a bancke, whereupon it is not deeper then seven fathom, but betwixt the rocks &amp; the Seams, it is 50 fathom deepe.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Seames and Ushant the broad sound<NOTE PLACE="marg">Broad-sound.</NOTE> lyeth in e.n.e. to S. Matthewes poynt, and from S. Matthewes poynt w.s.w. 5 leagues into sea.</P>
<P>To the eastwards of Fontenay, or the Lavender, lieth the Frieze Bay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friese bay</NOTE> there men may anchor for a southeast &amp; east wind, in good anchor ground.</P>
<P>To the eastwards of the Frieze Bay, lyeth Boldavids Bay<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boldavids Bay.</NOTE> a broad deep sound, lying into the land east north∣east. At the e. side of that haven lie 2 little Islands or Rocks, where men may anchor round about them, and lie sheltred for all windes.</P>
<P>From the Race of Fontenay to the Pennes, the course is southeast somewhat easterly about 10 or 11 leagues, betwixt them both lieth Oldyarne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldyarne</NOTE> a good Haven, about 7 leagues east southeast from Fontenay. Thwart before the entry of it lieth a banke where men may run about it on both sides in 6 fathom.</P>
<P>The south poynt of this Haven is flat, therefore run in alongst by the north point, there is at low water not lesse then 3 fathom depth. From Oldyarne to the Pennes it is s.e. and by south.</P>
<P>If you will anchor before Port Kapstand, you must anchor in 12 or 13 fathom, before the village that stan∣deth upon the high land, about halfe waies betwixt the point of the Race, and the great sand-bay of Oldyarn, where the little sharpe Tower doth stand, the point of the Race shall then lie from you about northnorthwest, and you shall then lie a great half league from the land, further off from the shoare it is rocky and foule ground, as some say. There have some neverthelesse come to anchor there by night in 3 or 4 leagues from the shoare in 25 fathom, but have not received any hurt neither of cables nor anchors.</P>
<P>The west end of the Seames, and the Pennes, lie south∣east and by east, and northwest and by west, distant about 13 leagues.</P>
<P>The knowledge of the land betwixt Fontenay and Old∣yarne, are two round hills, which men doe call the sheets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheete.</NOTE> or Slaeplakens, to the westwards of them stand two Mills. It is a very ragged point, and by these foresaid markes very good to be known. Men may see them without the Seames in 55 fathom.</P>
<P>From Oldyarne to the Pennes lieth the coast south∣east and by south 5 leagues.</P>
<P>The Pennes<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pens</NOTE> are very easy to be known, for him that hath seen them once: upon the southeast end standeth a thicke flat Tower; a little to the westwards of it stan∣deth a sharpe tower, and somewhat more to the east wards against the high land, standeth a village apprearing like a castle, upon the east side there of standeth a flat tower, and there close to the land lie 2 great rocks.</P>
<P>The pennes lye off from the maine land, southeast two leagues into the sea. For to sayle in there, you must come in there from the eastwards, and run alongst by the strand of the maine land, leaving all the rocks on the larboard side, untill that you come to a great rock, which you must leave on the starboard side, and runne about to the southwards of it (being past it, edge within it up towards the Northwest, and you may anchor there a little within, in three fathom at low water, lying there, you can see no sea, but at high water the sea cometh very much tumbling in through the Rocks: You may goe away from thence at high water southeast through the Rocks into sea, but you must take very good heed, because it is there full of Rocks where of some are above water, and some under water. Without the foresaid great Rock in the comming in of this haven, it is at least ten fathom deep, so that for need men might well save a great ship there.</P>
<P>From the Pennes to the Glannons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glanons.</NOTE> or Glenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glenant.</NOTE> the course is e.s.e. with that course you shall run alongst to the southwards of them. Within the Glanons lieth a Haven, called Bindeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bindet.</NOTE> at the east point of that Haven it is full of rocks. For to saile in there, you must take heed unto these marks: there stand two Mills farre within the land, bring the eastermost of the 2 over a little castle that standeth upon a point within the Haven, and run in, keeping them soo n. &amp; n. e. and by east in, and then you cannot take hurt on neither of both shoares, and being come within the haven, anchor be∣fore the Town.</P>
<P>A league southwest from Gloylend or Glenant, by the Dutchmen, called the easter-Penmarkes, lieth a great Rock under water, but is good to be espied, in regard the sea alwaies breaketh upon it; as well within as without this Rock it is 40 fathom deep.</P>
<P>When you come of from the Pens, with an e.s.e. course, you shall runne alongst farre enough to the southwards of it. About 2 leagues the eastwards of Glenant, lye the Islands of Muttons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moutons-Jslands.</NOTE> by the French cal∣led Isles aux Moutons, you may sayle through betwixt them and the main land, unto Groy or Blavet, also you may anchor within them in 10 or 12 fathom, betwixt the land and the foresaid Islands, which are cleane upon the north side.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Island Mutton and Glenant lyeth a rock, for to avoyd it (for them which will saile through there betwixt them) they must leave one third part of the channel towards Glenant, and the other two third parts towards Mutton, and then they may boldly run through there without feare.</P>
<P>From Mutton to the Island Groy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Groy.</NOTE> the course is east and by south, upon the outer side of Groy stand 3 or 4 mills, the east end of it goeth steepe downe, and the west end sloping and flat down, thereby it is good to be known. Under Groy is good anchoring for a s.w. winde in six or seven fathom: Under the n.e. point also is a good road for a w.s.w. &amp; n.w. winde, there is very good anchor-ground. At the s.w. end runneth off a foule ledge, where of men must take good heed.</P>
<P>Within the Island Groy lyeth the Haven of Blavet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blavet.</NOTE> which lyeth in about northwest in 4 and 5 fathom. Upon the west side of this haven standeth a high sharpe Tower called Quinperly, from the east poynt runneth off a great ledge of rocks, called the Baers, within it on the east side of the entry of the Haven lye two suncken Rocks, also on the west side a Rock with a hole, which at halfe ebbe is uncovered, whereof men must take very good heed in the comming in; Men run in alongst by the west land, for to eschew the foresayd suncken rock &amp; foule grounds. The marks for to sayle in there are these, there lyeth a little Island within in the middest of the haven, which you may see when you are without the Haven. To the eastwards of that little Island upon the maine land, standeth an Abbey; bring that Abbey right to the east poynt of the haven, which lyeth within the Baers, and sayle in with it, untill you come thwart of the east poynt within the Baers, and runne in about by it: being within it, there it is wide and broad, you may anchor there before the foresayd little Island in 5 or 6 fathom, there it is at low water 3 or 4 fathom deepe, or else men commonly runne in about, by the poynt, untill they come in the oaze.</P>
<P>From the Pennes unto Bell-Isle, the course is eastsouth∣east twenty leagues, but from Groy to Bell-Isle it is souhsoutheast five leagues. Bell-Isle hath at the north∣west end a steepe poynt, lying out with a great saddle, thereabouts stand also some little houses, and the end goeth very steepe downe.</P>
<P>When as Bell-Isle lieth n.n.e. from you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road to know Bell-Isle.</NOTE> the west end sheweth it selfe in three parts: the westermost where of is a great rock, which floweth at a very high water almost under at the east end there divideth it selfe off also a great rock: by these foresayd marks it is indifferent well to be knowne, men may see Bell-Isle out of the sea in 55 fathom. At the s. side lye off many rocks &amp; little Islands.</P>

<P>He that commeth from the west, and is bound to Morbeam, Roche Barnard, or other places thereabout, must run to the southwards of it, if the will not saile about to the southwards of Bell-Isle, he may saile through betwixt the northermost and the middlemost Island, and also he may sail through betwixt Bell-Isle and the fore∣sayd Islands, about to the eastwards of the Cardinall. The channell there betwixt them both, is about a league broad and cleane, it lyeth through e.s.e. and by east, men may run alongst by the Cardinals either by night or by day, in 8, 9, and 10 fathom, all cleane sandy ground.</P>
<P>For to sayle through betwixt the weste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most, which is fast at the north end with the strand to the maine land, and the middlemost Island, the course is from the n.w. e d of Bell-Isle e.n.e.

<HEAD>The second Demonstration. Where in is. Contained the Description of the Island of Boelin to the River of Bourdeaux.</HEAD>
<P>FRom the east poynt of the Cardinall to the River of Roche Barnard, the course right northeast: there lyeth a little Island about halfe wayes betwixt the Cardinall and the foresayd river ot rather nearer the Cardinall then the River (for when men are by the River, they can but even see the foresayd little Island) men runne with the foresayd course of northeast close alongst to the westwards, of that little Island, and shall fall a little to the northwards of the river, run then within a Cables length alongst by the shoare unto it, untill that the river doe open it selfe, and then sayle in amids the channel, &amp; give the rocks a birth that lie at the easter shoare. Being come within the rocks, you may anchor there, or else sayle on against the shoare on the star∣board side, &amp; so may save ship and goods without anchor or cable, if there should be such need. At low water with an ordinary tyde, there is about eleven, and with a spring nine foot water; with an ordinary tyde it floweth there about a fathom, but with spring 2 fathom up and downe: the entring of the river lyeth in east &amp; by south. A little to the eastwards of the rivers mouth, lyeth a great rock which at high water is covered.</P>
<P>Hee that commeth from the River of Nantes, and is bound to Roche Barnard, &amp; is not well acquainted there betwixt both, let him runne so farre to seawards of the Cardinall (when hee is to the westwards of the Four) untill that hee run about a seaboard of that foresayd little Island (lying halfe wayes betwixt the Cardinal &amp; the River of Roche Barnard) then goeth he surely cleare of all the foule ground and other dangers, men may sayle close alongst by it to the westwards, but to the east∣wards, of it lye many Rockes and shoals.</P>
<P>Hee that will sayle alongst to the eastwards or to the northwards of it, must leave about 2 third parts of the water to the Island, and one third part towards the land, &amp; so runne through betwixt them, but must looke out well.</P>
<P>Betwixt the rivers of Roche Bernard and Nantes, lieth Old-downes, Croisill, or Croswyck, and Poelgem. Croswyck<NOTE PLACE="marg">Croswyck</NOTE> hath two poynts, within the northwest Poynt lyeth the great village of Croswyck, which hath a thick tower, &amp; there is a great in draught like a haven, where men may goe to anchor in five, six or seven fathom: to the westwards of it standeth also a flat Church upon the high land. The land of Olddownes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old∣downes.</NOTE> lyeth a little to the northwards of the Church. Poelgem<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poelgem.</NOTE> is a village to the eastwards of Croswyck, with a high sharpe Tower.</P>
<P>About two leagues from the land southwest and by south from Croswyck, and west and by southsoutherly from the e. point of Poelgem, lyeth a great bank, called the Four,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Four</NOTE> which at some places falleth dry at low water, and lyeth from BellIsle near about east &amp; lyeth the longest way southwest and northeast.</P>
<P>If you will sayle from Bell-Isle to the river of Nantes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail into the River of Nantes.</NOTE> then goe away from the east end of the Cardinall, or from the eastermost rocks that lye of from the Cardinall, directly e.n.e. towards the west poynt of Croswyck, for to saile a weather of the foresayd Four, so long untill it begin to shoale, and that the sharp tower of Poelgem commeth against the highest of the east poynt of Cros∣wyck, then you runne alongst to the northwards of the foresayd banck, goe then e.s.e. or according as the wind is east &amp; by south, &amp; e.s.e. unto the Rock with the hole, called Pierre-perce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pierre-Perce.</NOTE> but so that you come not very neare (at low water) the land somwhat to the westwards of Poelgem, for it is not cleane alongst by it. Betwixt the Four and the point of Croswyck it is in the fareway 8, 9, and 10 fathom deepe.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Poelgem eastwards lye some little Islands and Rocks, which are very foule, come not very neare them, nor the shoare thereabouts. If it should happen that you should turne to windwards, for at low water there falleth many of the rocks dry, when you come neare the rock with the hole) then run alongst to the northwards of it, and run in very close by it, leaving it on the starboard side of you for to avoyd the foule grounds, which lye off from the poynt of Poelgem towards this rock. Close alongst by this rock it is foure fathom deepe. Being past this Rock with the hole, then runne all alongst by the north shoare, unto S. Nazare<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Nazare</NOTE> in three or foure fathom at low water, but you must take heed of a rocky poynt, some∣what to the westwards of S. Nazare, the markes thereof are these: There standeth a mill upon the high land, somewhat farre within the land, when that commeth over a countrey-mans house, which standeth below by the river, then are you thwart of the rocks, being past them, keep yet the north shoare, and runne alongst by it, untill you come within the poynt of S. Nazare, and anchor there in 6 or 7 fathom. In the middest of the river betwixt the foresayd rocks with the hole, and S. Nazare, lyeth a row of Rocks, called Les Porceaux,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Les Por∣ceaux.</NOTE> these come at halfe tyde above water: Because of them, &amp; also more other shoals, lying in the river, you must run all alongst by the north shoare I as is before sayd.</P>
<P>Somewhat within S. Nazare upon the north-land standeth a sharp Tower when that commeth without the south land, then you cannot take hurt of the foresand rocks, run alongst to the northwards of them, a little to the eastwards of them lyeth another shoale of Rocks, where men may run about the eastwards of it with great shippes, it is there very shoale water alongst to the poynt; being within the poynt, men may anchor, as is sayd, in 6 or 7 fathom. To the eastwards of Saint Nazare lye two other villages, and there betwixt the Villages it is very shoale, and stony ground, there men must bor∣row over the souther shoare, but when you are halfe wayes to the eastermost Village then you may well sayle right on with the poynt of the Village, untill you be past it, but against that eastermost Village on the s. side, upon the poynt, lyeth a banck, called Pynbut<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pynbut.</NOTE> which, lieth at least halfe wayes over in the River, but men may run through betwixt the poynt and this bancke in 5 or 6 fathom, this is the road for shippes that are bound out to sea.</P>
<P>A league further in, in the middest of the river lie two stony banks in the fareway. At Pelerin<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pelerin.</NOTE> is the lading place, 2 leagues from Nantes, where the good are brought off with Lighters from the ships, but from S. Nazare to Nantes, or Pelerin, it is Pilots water, which men do commonly take in, by the above named sharp Tower, called S. Nazare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Nazare</NOTE> where men (when they are within it) may anchor in 10, or 12 fathom, and stay for a Pilot.</P>
<P>For to run into sea from S. Nazaro, alongst to the south wards of the rock with the hole, you must run first alongst by the north shoare, as is before sayd, untill that you come without the second poynt of the River, edge then off from the north land to the middest of the River; and sayle a good wayes about to the southwards of Pierre-perce, when as you can see the Rocke (which lieth to the northwards of Pierre-perce) without the poynt, there it is deepe 4 f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thom &amp; a halfe, and when as Pierre-Perce
<PB N="68" REF="215"/> is n.n.west, and north and by west from you, then you come thwart of the Rock, and there you finde deeper water, to wit, 5, 6 and at least 7 fathom, but when you come in the fareway of Pickeliers, then you get 10 or 12 fathom water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Banks be∣fore the Loiret.</NOTE>Before the River of Nantes lye many bancks, but at half flood men goe over them, the south poynt of the river of Nantes lyeth from the North poynt North∣northwest and southsoutheast 4 leagues asunder, to the southwards of it, the land lyeth in with a great indraught, and there men doe run into the Bay. These uneven banks in the river of Nantes, are very unlike, sometimes men sound in 15 fathom, and presently afterwards but 7 or 8 fathom.</P>
<P>But to sayle from Bell-Isle to the bay or Armentiers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armen∣tiers.</NOTE> you must goe e.s.e. untill that you see the Abbey of Armentiers to the eastwards of the trees, which stand within the land over the same Abbey, then goe on e. and by n. so long untill that the Abbey come within the castle of Armentiers, then are you within the Moncks legge. Goe then againe e.s.e. untill that you bee within the rock of Pierremen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pierre∣men.</NOTE> you may goe about it on both sides, and when that you can see the Grave open, then you may anchor in 7, or 8, fathom, and row a shoare to fetch a Pilot, it is Pilots water. From Bell-Isle to Armentiers, the course is eastsoutheast about 12 or 13 leagues asunder.</P>
<P>From Armentiers to Use, or Heys, it is south and by east 7 leagues, and from Bell-Isle to Use or Heys, south∣east 16, leagues. The Island of Pickeliers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pickeliers</NOTE> lyeth right before the poynt of Armentiers. Betwixt Armentiers or Pickeliers and Use, it is an uneven fareway, with many shoales and banks from 4, 5, 6, and 7 fathom Upon Use<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heys or Use.</NOTE> standeth a sharp tower and some little houses or mills, whereby it is very easy to be knowne. It is in the fareway betwixt Use and Bell-Isle 35, and 40 fathom, but when men are within the fareway, it is 25 fathom deepe.</P>
<P>Under Use it is not very good riding, the sea commeth alwayes so rowling in, as if the water came through under the Island, at the northend it is shoale water, the road is, when the Church steeples is southwest from you, in 8, or 9, fathom; but men lye there not sheltred but onely for a south west and w.s.w. winde, and it doth ripple there allwayes very much.</P>
<P>From Use to the Killiats, or to the Island of Saint Martens, the courses is eastsoutheast twelve or thirteene leagues. Betwixt both lyeth the Baerges of Olone about halfe a league off from the land of Poictou, and east and by south seven leagues from Use in the right fareway, and in regard that it is nothing but Rocks and stones, therefore it is not good to come neare them in darke weather, men may sayle round about them, and at low water they are uncovered. If you will sayle from Use, unto the Killiaets, or unto the tayle of Aise, through within the Barges, then sayle on first east, and being within the Baerges of Olone, sayle to the land of Poicton, which lyeth from Olone to Saint Martens Island eastsoutheast, and from Olone to the Pickelliers northwest.</P>
<P>From Olone to the Killiaets the coast lyeth most eas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣southeast foure or five leagues. For to sayle into the Killiaets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sayl into the Killiats:</NOTE> which is in alongst to the northwards of the Island of S. Marten, in betwixt the foresayd Island and the mayne land of Poictou, you must goe in some∣what more northerly then the middle of the channell, or leave two third parts of the channell towards S. Mar∣tens Island, &amp; one third part towards the mayne land. Alongst by the Island of S. Martens it is uneven, and somewhat full of bancks; come not too neare also the mayne land, for there lye off also some banckes, but you may borrow of them by your lead. Goe in alongst, as before is sayd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks of the banck before S. Martens.</NOTE> untill that the Church of S. Martin be southsouthwest from you, then you shal bee past the banck which lieth north from S. Martens, and lyeth off from the shoare somewhat to the westwards of Saint Martens, there is, a hard steepe stony banke, which shoaleth up suddenly. For to avoyd it when as you must turne too and againe with an easterly, or a northeast winde, you must not bring the little Tower of Hars in the Village of Loy, but when the little Tower of Hars commeth to the first, or northermost house of Loy, then you must cast about, for then you come against the banck, where remaineth at low water about a fathom depth, and at high water about foure fathom. When the foresayd little Tower of Hars commeth against a mill which standeth at the south end of Loy, then are you within the Banke, to wit, betwixt the Bancke and S. Martens. When S. Martens commeth to be s.w. and by south, and s.s.w. from you, then you may boldly saile over the end of the bank towards S. Martens, you shall finde there at low water and spring tide at least 3 fathom or sixteen or seventeen foot, also one cast or 2 but 12 foot then it is all soft ground, as also before S. Mar∣tens, but the bancks are hard, &amp; with spring tides there remaineth little water upon them. Before S. Martins you may anchor in 4, 5, or 6 fathom.</P>
<P>For to anchor before S. Martins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to an∣chor befo∣re Saint Martens.</NOTE> you must anchor so, that you may see open into the haven, and that the point of the Abbey, and the Bosse doe stand the length of two capsta nebars one from the other, there is with spring tides at low water three fathom and a halfe, but at high water six fathom and a halfe deepe.</P>
<P>When you sayle into the Killiats, as before is sayd, it is 12, 11, and 10 fathom deepe, but being come so farre that the Tower of S. Martins beginneth to stand s.w. from you, there it will be by little and little shoaler, and then you may well edge towards the Island in five &amp; foure fathom, it shoaleth then suddenly up, and will be from ten, quickly five, and foure fathom.</P>
<P>If you will goe over the banck that lieth off from the Abbey with a shippe that draweth much water, then you must stay so long that it be halfe flood, for at low water there remaineth no more upon it then three fa∣thom, or a foot or two more: when it is somewhat flowed, then you may well goe over with a great shippe. When the little tower of Hussou commeth to the north end of the Island Urck, or Tivalenes, then are you upon the shoalest of the bank, but when the little. Tower commeth over the south end of that little Island, then it beginneth to deepen againe.</P>
<P>The markes for to keepe the deepest water, when you run over the bank are these keep the great Tower of Rochel a handspikes length to the southward of the wood of trees, which standeth upon the northermost high land, and run so over the banck, it is there all soft ground.</P>
<P>If you will anchor before the Abbey within the banke, then run in 6 or 7 fathom and anchor there.</P>
<P>But if you will not anchor under S. Martens, but wil sayle forth towards Burnt Island, then bring that fore∣sayd little tower of Lussou over the little house that standeth upon the little Island Urck, &amp; keep it so stan∣ding, &amp; then you can take no hurt of the Laverdyne.</P>
<P>The Laverdyne<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laverdin.</NOTE> is a rane of rocks together a musket shot long, which lieth off from the east point of S. Mar∣tens Island, about an English mile, and with spring tide at low water is uncovered. Betwixt it and the Island of S. Martens men may sayle through, there is depth enough. The markes of the Laverdyne are these: When you come in at the Killiats, and sayle through betwixt S. Martens Island &amp; the Bosse, &amp; you come to see the great Tower of Rochell even without the point of the Bosse, then are you right thwart of the Laverdyne; which lyeth then s.w. from you, it is there betwixt them both not very wide: or else when the foresayd great Tower of Rochel standeth even without the poynt of Bosse, and the North poynt, of the Plom a ships length without the south poynt (which is the north poynt of the Bosse) then are you right upon the Laverdyne, there¦fore
<PB N="69" REF="215"/> when Rochell commeth a ships length to the south∣wards of the Bosse (when you come in at the Killiats) then are you past the Laverdyne, &amp; you may boldly goe on s.e. and s.e. and by south towards Burnt-Island.</P>
<P>Porthus<NOTE PLACE="marg">Portus.</NOTE> is a broad and wide channell, lying in through betwixt S. Martens Island and Oleron, and lyeth from Use s.e. &amp; by e. distant about 15 leagues. If you will sayle into Porthus, then run in betwixt both lands e.s.e. but much nearer S. Martens Island, for to avoyd the banck of Oleron, which is a foule ledge of rocks, at the n. end of Oleron, come no neare it by night then in 12 or 13 fa∣thom.</P>
<P>When you come then by the east end of S. Martens Island and are bound to Rochell, or else will anchor under the Bosse bring the great Tower of Rochel a ships length without the Bosse, so you can take no hurt of the Laverduyn. You may anchor under the Bosse in 5 or 6 fathom soft ground, so that the poynt doe lye north from you. Or else if you will anchor under the Abbey of S. Martens Island, then run in upon the foresayd marks, so long untill that the foresayd Abbey come without the s. poynt of the same Island, sayle then right with it and then you shall leave the Laverduyn farr enough on the larboard side of you. And being come neare the Abbey, anchor a little to the aestwards of it in 5, 6, or 7, fathom, there is the road for ships that are bound out.</P>
<P>When you goe into Porthus, and will sayle to the Burnt Island, then runne in (as before is sayd) untill you come neare the east end of S. Martens Island: thence the course is south east, and by east, or from the Bosse south or south and by east, or with a westerly wind south and by west unto that Island.</P>
<P>When you sayle soo neare Burnt-Island<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnt-Island.</NOTE> that the Tower of Voorn, or the Four, commeth over the Burnt-Island, there you may cast your ballast over board, it is there 12 fathom deepe.</P>
<P>If you must turne to and againe with a southerly wind from the Bosse to the Burnt-Island, or from Burnt-Island to the Bosse, then come not to neare the land of Rochell, there lye divers stony banckes alongst the land, a good wayes from the shoare, where of you must take heed. When Rochell is hidden behinde the south poynt which lyeth over against the Creeke, there lyeth a stony bancke, upon which remaineth not a fathom of water.</P>
<P>If you will sayle into the river of Sherrant, then runne about to the southwards of Burnt-Island, you may also sayle about to the northwards of it, and sayle in by the Tower of Voorn, or Four. At low water this river falleth dry, at least 4 leagues within the land. For to sayle from Burnt-Island to Burwage, you must sayle away s.s.e. &amp; keepe the little Tower of Heers to the westwards of the wood, so long untill the tower of Voorn or le Four, come over the little red-tyled house, that stands rpon the s. side of the river of Sherrant sayle then in s.e. and by little &amp; little s.e. &amp; by east untill that Pront (a village that lieth upon the strand) commeth to the n. wards of Soubi∣se, when as then Soubise cometh within the foresayd village, and the mill above the village, then you shall be against the poynt of Oysterbanck:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oyster∣bancks.</NOTE> goe then in alongst s. e. &amp; by south, and bring that outermost little Tower of Heers, over the outermost sandy place, where the gallowes standeth by, keep them so standing, and sayle in s.s.e, when as then the little Tower of Heers commeth to the east side of the valley, whicb is in the wood, then keepe that sharpe little Tower right over the east side of the valley of the wood, and sayle in so into the Creeke, or river of Burwage. At Burwage was wont not to stand a house, where now is a strong faire Towne, being builded so within 70 or 80 yeares past.</P>
<P>The Bannier lyeth alongst the land of Oleron, and lyeth untill within Burnt-Island, at low water it is uncovered, and the tayle of it lyeth farre to the north∣wards. If you should turn out from the Creek towards the Burnt Island, then bring the Tower of Rochell not without the Burnt-Isand, before you come thwart of it, because of the Baniard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baniard.</NOTE> &amp; thē you shall take no hurt of it.</P>
<P>At the south end of Oleron, betwixt Oleron and the land to the southwards of it, is yet another channell, where men may sayle in and out, called the Mamme-sound, deep enough for great shipps, it lyeth in from out of the sea east and by n. being come there within, there runneth up ariver southeast towards Sales, where men doe lade salt, being past that, to the other poynt of the Mamme-sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamme sound.</NOTE> lyeth a plate, where of men runne to the northwards upon these marks: you must keepe the mill that standeth upon the lands of Oleron over the trees and so you shall runne to the northward) off the plate, there is the road for them that will lade salt at Oleron or Olderdon.</P>
<P>But if you will runne in through, and out againe, then you must fayle so farre to the eastwards, untill that Sales come over the trees, which stand within Merven, for to avoyd the tayle or riffe that shooteth of from Oleron: when Sales commeth over the trees, sayle then north and by w. on, the Burnt-Island, but bring Duke Charles Tower to the s. wards of the Burnt-Island, for not to sayle within the Banniard. When the little Tower of Heers commeth to the wood keepe it then so standing untill Rochell commeth over the north side of the Burnt-Island sayle then out at the Portrush. There shooteth of also a riffe from the west-end of Saint Martens Island,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe at S. Martens Island.</NOTE> where of you must take heed.</P>

<P>FRom the Band or Crage off Oleron to the Tower of Cordan, or the Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-head, or the mouth off the River off Bourdeaux, called the Garrone, the land lyeth south s.east; and s. and by e. 13 leagues.</P>
<P>To the northwardes of the mouth of the river of Bourdeaux, lye five or six high white Sand-hills, but to the southwards off it, it is somewhat low land, blacke little Sandhilles, being growne with spiry grasse.</P>
<P>From the Tower of Cordan off to the northwards, towards the high Sand-Hills, which lye upon the north land lieth a sand-bancke, called the Piper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Piper.</NOTE> men may sound alongst by it on the west side in seven fathom, but upon the northend it is very steepe, and not farre off it is twenty fathom deep.</P>
<P>From the north-point off the River runneth off to the southwards, a sand called the norther Asses, and to the southwards of it lyeth another sand, called the souther Asses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Norther &amp; souther Asses.</NOTE> through betwixt them both, &amp; also alongst to the southwards of them, men sayle into the River.</P>
<P>If you will sayle into the River comming from the northwards, then you may run alongst by the shoale in 12 and 13 fathom, untill that the tower of Cordan stand southeast &amp; by east from you, runne then right in with it, through betwixt the norther and souther Asses. untill that the high white sandhil upon the north point of the river stand northnortheast from you, men may so (com∣ming from the northwards) runne in also about by the norther Asses, by your lead, untill that the Tower come to be southsoutheast, and southeast and by south from you then goe towards the Tower, and when the foresayd high sand-hil come to be northnortheast or northeast and by north from you, sayle then right in with it untill that you have the sounding of the land, run then in alongst by it, towards Messie, that is the point where all the mils stand. When you shall saile thus towards the high sand-hill, and that the Tower of Soulack commeth a great fathom to the northwards of the Tower of Cordan and the little mill of Royan<NOTE PLACE="marg">Royan.</NOTE> then are you also past the Piper, &amp; may run in right east without feare towards Royan, but you must reckon well your tyde, for the flood falleth thwart over the Asses towards the Tower off Cordan, and the ebbe in the contrary.</P>
<P>In this foresaid channell through betwixt the Asses re∣maineth at low water 3 fathom water upon the shoals.</P>
<P>For to sayl into the river alongst to the southwards of the Asses, comming from the northwards, (that is, the best channell) you must do thus: Bring the Tower of Soulacke east from you, or somewhat more northerly, and sayle in so right with it untill the tower of Cordan be north and by east, and north north east from you, Royan shall then stand north east from you, or else if you come from the southwards, then bring the tower of Cordan north and by east, and north n.e. from you, and sayle in so right with it untill Soulack come to be east from you, Royan shall then stand n. e. from you sayle then right to∣wards it, &amp; comming near it, sayle to the point of Messie.</P>
<P>When you are now within the Rivers mouth, and come right against the point of Messie, that is the point where the Mills stand upon, then edge over towards the broken Castle, called Chastillion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chastillion</NOTE> south east and by south, that is, eight leagues from Messie, and then forth in alongst by the south land, south east in unto Pouliack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pouliac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> which is two great leagues.</P>
<P>In the fareway betwixt the Piper and the poynt with the Mills, or Messie, it is 10, 11, and 12 fathom deepe, but out of the fare-way, either on the north side, or south side, it is shoaly, to wit, five, six, seven, and eight fathom, you must runne alongst close by the point of Messie, there it is 22 fathom deep.</P>
<P>When as that Royan commeth to the west poynt, where upon the mills stand keep it so standing, and go away south east and by south towards Chastillion, it is in this fareway almost all alongst 5 fathom deep, but com∣ming near the north or south side, it is shoaly, and at the nortst side it is full of sands, where also men may well sayle through that are acquainted.</P>
<P>From Chastillion to Pouliack<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pouliack.</NOTE> it is 2 great leagues s. east, the course is as before is said, and it is there deep 4, 5, 6, and 7 fathom. Over against Pouliack in the midst of the River lieth a little Island to the eastwards, men must runne about it, right in with Bloy, but there men must goe over with the tyde, for it is there at low water but a little more then one fathom deep.</P>
<P>When you are before Pouliack, and will sayle to Bloye, then let the water first flow an houre, and then you may well goe over with a ship that draweth nine or ten foote water. The markes for to sayle alongst in the deepest water of this reach, are these: there standeth a Mill halfe waies betwixt Bloye and Rocktaw, keepe that without the new wall of Bloye, and then you shall run in the deepest of the Channell.</P>
<P>Before Bloye<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bloye.</NOTE> it is againe three or foure fathom deepe, runne then alongst by the north land in three, foure, and five fathom. When you come before the River which lieth up to the eastwards called Dordoigne, then sayle first right with the midd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the second Island,
<PB N="72" REF="219"/> and leave it on the starboard side, and go indifferent neare alongst by it, untill that you be over against or past the Gallowes, which standeth upon the east poynt of the River: and then againe alongst by the north land unto the foure little houses. From thence you must edge over to the high tower of Dublot or Pigeonhouse, coming thwart of it, you must presently edge over against to the east side, to the hight neare Lermond; in that edging over, you shall runne through betwixt a stone banke on the larboard side, and a shoale sand-plate on the starboard side, over a banke called the Pace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pace.</NOTE> which is the shoaliest of all the river, there remaineth at low water a little lesse then a fathom. Being come over the Pace to the east side, goe then in alongst by the east shoare, untill you be past Lermond, then sayle againe over to the west side, right with the houses of Charter∣house, and then in all alongst by the west shoare, untill you come before the towne of Bourdeaux, in that crook∣ed reach betwixt Larmond and Charterhouse it is 5, 6, and 7 fathom deep, and before the town 4 and 5 fathom.</P>
<P>When men will sayle out of the river of Burdeaux, they must stay at Royan untill they have good weather, and a sore-ebbe to run out with: in running out, keepe the high sand-hill north north east from you, so long untill that the tower of Cordan be south east and by east from you, then you may sayle out through the Asses northwest and by west into sea.</P>
<P>From Cordan, or the river of Bourdeaux, unto Arca∣chon, the coast lieth s. and n. twenty leagues, it is all low sandy land, betwixt them both lieth a tyde-haven called Anchises men may go in there well at high water with great ships.</P>
<P>Before the haven of Arcachon, or Arcason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arcason.</NOTE> lie three shoals, men may sayle into the northwards of them, and also into the southwards of them: the norther entry goeth in betwixt the north poynt and the northermost shoale, but it is narrow and not deep. The souther entry lieth to the southwards of all the shoals by the souther poynt, in betwixt two shoaly sand-bankes, where of the one lieth off from the southermost shoale, and the other from the south point of maine land, s. west and by w. in to the sea. The land to the n. wards of this haven is altogethet somewhat low sandy land without trees, but to the southwards of it they are all somewhat high sand-hils without trees also, but comming before the havens mouth, you shall see within in the land many trees. When you come out of the sea either from the northwards or the southwards, neare about this havens mouth, you shall easily aspy the foresaid bankes on both sides of the souther entry, by the breaking of the sea, and you may borrow of them by your lead, as neare as you please, they are very cleane and flat. Upon the sandhils within the haven mouth, stand two great high masts. If you will sayle in there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sail in to the haven of Arcason.</NOTE> then bring the two Masts one in the other, and then they shall stand north east and by east from you keepe them one in the other, and sayle in so right with them, and you shall so sayle in betwixt the two foresaid bankes, and at low water you shall not finde lesse then two fathom water, but at high water you shall have five and a halfe, and sixe fathom water, go in so upon the markes, untill you come within the shoals, and to the end of the shoale sand on the larboard side. Being gotten in within it, you must luffe up about by it, and goe then on north untill you come to the poynt, which you shall see on the starboard side, but give that a birth, because there runneth off a tayle, there is in that reach no lesse then ten, eleven, or twelve fathom deep. Being come about that poynt, you may then sayle in close alongst by the land on the star∣bord side, which lieth east south east, or you may anchor there in sixteen, fifteen, twelve, and ten fathom, or further in about the second poynt, in two and three fathom. Over against the first pont, on the north side, it falleth very far dry, a great waies within.</P>
<P>From Arcason to Bayone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bayone.</NOTE> the coast lieth south and north sixteen or seventeen leagues. The Rivers mouth of Bayone lieth in betwixt two plaine strands e.s.e. and east and by south, and sometimes more easterly or northerly, by reason of the shifting and altering of the sands before the Rivers mouth. Upon the land on the south side of the channell, stand two masts, these you must keepe one in the other, or the innermost a little to the northwards of the outermost, and run so in over the Barre or shoaliest place, untill you come against the south point, and then in alongst by it. Upon the foresaid Barre is at high water and Spring tyde, at least three fathom, with an ordinary tyde two fathom and a halfe, but at low water no more then 3 foot water. When you come about the point, you must sayle up to the south∣wards, keeping about the middle of the channell alongst the river, or rather nearest the west side, for to avoide some foule ground and shoale, that lie on the east side, and anchor before the town in foure, five, or sixe fathom. This Bar and this River is Pilots water.</P>
<P>A little within this Barre on the north side of the river lieth up to the northwards, a great water within, of 7 leagues long, and falleth out into Sea by Cabritton. Alongst that great water the ships were wont to sayle up to Bayone, but it is now upon the south end at the river of Bayone, almost altogether paled too, so that there can but small barkes goe through, for to keepe the better the Barre of Bayone deepe with scowring through of the water.</P>
<P>From the Barre of Bayone to S. John de Luz,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Iohn de Luz</NOTE> the course is south and by west 4 leagues, there is a faire Bay, where men may ride in five, sixe, seven, or eight fathom, according as they will lye farre in, cleane sandy ground, at the end of the Bay is a little tyde-haven, where upon lyeth the towne on the west side. At high water, and with an ordinary tyde, there commeth nine foote, but with a spring twelve foote water, at low water it falleth altogether dry, so that men may goe over there with drie feete. A little within the west point of the Bay is also a little Dock, where there is a foot water more then in the foresaid tyde-haven, but it falleth also dry at low water.</P>
<P>This Bay is very good to know by these marks that hereafter are written: It lyeth right in the Bight, to the eastwardes of it lyeth the land north and by east towards Bayone, and to the westwardes of it the land falleth away southwest nnd by west, and southwest towards Fonteravia. Upon the east poynt of the Bay standeth a white Fire-tower, which men may see farre off, especial∣ly when the Sunne shineth upon it, then it shineth very white more then the other land. Upon the west poynt standeth a flat white house a little wayes upon the high land, to the westwardes of the Bay it is upon the sea side gray and blewish land. Alsoo the high hill of S. John de Luz, is a good marke for to know this Bay, which remaineth in sayling in, lying somewhat to the eastwar∣des, or on the larboard side. This foresayd hill of S. John de Luz sheweth it selfe out in height above all other hilles thereabouts, &amp; thereby is very good to be knowne above upon the top it is somewhat flat, as is demonstra∣ted in the rising of the lands. Upon this foresayd hill standeth a Chappell, from whence men may see into foure Kingdomes: France, Spaine, Navarre, and Arragon.</P>
<P>About two leagues southwest and southwest and by west from S. John de Luz, lye the rocks called the Pignons of S. Anna,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pignons of S. Anna</NOTE> not farre from land: a league to the westwards of them lyeth the Bay of Fonteravia, being a faire Bay.</P>
<P>At the west poynt of the Bay lyeth the C. Figure, a high poynt, upon it standeth a castle, &amp; to the south∣wards of it a little chappel. At the poynt of this cape lyeth a rock a little wayes from it, but the sea cannot runne through betwixt them, except it be with very high floods, it breaketh a little through. At the east side of this bay lye two high rocks, and thwart of them lye also
<PB N="73" REF="219"/> some low rocks a good wayes off from the land. For to avoyd them you must sayle in by the west poynt for to come into this Bay, and being within it, you may anchor in eight or nine fathom, but so that the foresayd great rock at the C. Figuer stand northnorthwest from you, there you lye in faire sandy ground, and landlockt for a northwest winde. The Kroonenbrough<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kroonen∣berch.</NOTE> lyeth about halfe wayes betwixt S. John de Luz and this foresayd Bay of Fonteravia.</P>
<P>A little league to the westwards of C. de Figuer, lieth Passage<NOTE PLACE="marg">Passagie.</NOTE> also a faire haven At the west side of the havens mouth, which is very narrow, lyeth a round rock, so that it is evill to come in there with an ebb, but with a flood it is better, without it is very cleane, without any shoale or fowle grounds, but onely the foresayd rounde rocke. The towne lyeth a little within the haven on the w. side, where men doe lye before it in 7 fathom.</P>
<P>Two great leagues to the westwardes of Passage, lyeth S. Sebastians, betwixt both is also a sand-bay in a bight, where there goeth up into the land a shoale little river, where come in many Barkes.</P>
<P>The haven of Saint Sebastians<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Seba∣stians.</NOTE> is good for to come into, men doe runne in there betwixt two little castles, where of the eastermost is the greates, standing upon a high hill. The westermost is a little square Tower, and lyeth upon a little Island, or rock. In the havens mouth being narrow, betwixt the two foresayd little Castles, lyeth a rocke, which at low water is sixe fathom deepe, and when it is a storme out of the sea, it breaketh allwayes upon it, and lyeth neerest the east-land, by the west-land it is deepe ten fathom. Now for to avoyd the foresayd rocke in comming in, there commeth an Abbey to the eastwards of the westermost Island, &amp; a liitle Tower. If you keepe them one in the other, then you run into east∣wards of it.</P>
<P>For to anchor without S. Sebastians in the road, you must keepe the high hill which lyeth upon the poynt of Cape Figuer, without the foresayd eastermost castle, there you may anchor, but if the same come to be hidden behind the castle or Island, then you may not anchor in the road of S. Sebastians. When you are come through the narrow within the rock and the castles, then you may anchor at the east side under the great castle, there is the best road. Within the foresayd castle goeth up a little water, men may goe at low water on foot from the easter castle alongst a high strand upon the maine land, unto the Towne, which lyeth behinde the fore∣sayd high hill with the Castle, yet the strand at high water is covered; it is a bay, and within before the towne it is deepe five, sixe, and seven fathom, at the west side under the little Island, men may not anchor, because it is flat and shoale there.</P>
<P>He that will goe forth from thence into S. Sebastians. let him run in, keeping the middle channell, betwixt the two Islands, and let him leave the little Island where upon the chappel standeth on the starboard side, running in so right against the first or the second wall of the towne, and anchor there, the boats or shallops shall come aboard of him, and helpe him into the haven betwixt the walles.</P>
<P>A league to the westwardes of S. Sebastians, lyeth a sandbay, where men may anchor so deep and so shallow as they will.</P>

<HEAD>The fourth Demonstration, In which The Coast of Biscaye from Coninx reede to the Island S. Cypriaen, are delineated.</HEAD>
<P>From S. Sebastians to C. de Martinchaco, the course is w.n.w. 13 leagues. Betwixt them both lye the roades Gateria and Deva.</P>
<P>Gateria<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gateria.</NOTE> lyeth from S. Sebastians west and by north, and w.n.w. distant 7. leagues, being a faire round sand-bay, where is good riding for westerly winds, men lye there within the west poynt right before the Towne in faire sandy ground, a north winde commeth right from the poynt. This bay is commonly called Kings-haven.</P>
<P>Alongst the coast of Biscay, betwixt S. John de Luz and Gateria is every where clean ground and good an∣koring in 20 fathom.</P>
<P>From Gateria to Deva it is a league and halfe to the westwardes: which is an off-water that commeth out of the high-land.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the westwardes lyeth the poynt of Cape Martinchaco.</P>
<P>About thirteene leagues westnorthwest from S. Seba∣stians, lyeth the Cape de Martinchaco, a little to the westwardes of it is a good tyde-haven, wherein lyeth a little Towne about a league within the land, upon a river which commeth out of the high land. A little to the westwards of Cape de Martinchacol, lyeth a great rock fast to the land, and a little to the westwardes of the same another: upon the poynt called Punte de Avillanes. Southwest and by west from Martinchaco lyeth the ha∣ven of Barmea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barmea.</NOTE> a faire great Bay, the easter poynt is foule, therefore men must give it a good birth, and run in alongst by the west side, when they are gotten in it is large enough, there they may anchor where they will.</P>
<P>To the westwardes of Barmea, lyeth also Placentia<NOTE PLACE="marg">Placentia.</NOTE> upon a little River, the towne lyeth a little within the land. There are all tyde-havens.</P>
<P>From Cape de Martinchaco to Bilbao, (where betwixt lye the foresaid havens of Barmea and Placentia) it is s. southwest &amp; southwest &amp; by south 6 leagues.</P>
<P>From Placentia to Bilboa it is two leagues westsouth∣west and west and by south. Bilbao lyeth upon a great river alongst which there commeth of much Iron, it is a good haven, but it lyeth not farre in, by reason of the Barre which lyeth thwart over the haven, where men must goe in with high water.</P>
<P>At the east poynt of Bilbao<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bilbao.</NOTE> shooteth of a riffe, which men must avoyd, there lye also some rockes under water. It is a high steepe point, and is white to see to.</P>
<P>Within the riffe that runneth off from the poynt, men may anchor in seven and eight fathom, betwixt the poynt and the Piere on the east side, there the Pilots come off which bring up the shippes; and there men lye land-lockt far a northwest winde. From this foresayd poynt or road to the Barre or river mouth of Bilbao, it is a league and halfe s. &amp; by west, which lyeth in by the west land, there stand five or sixe houses upon the w. land, when the two westermost houses come one in the other, or when you may see through the two eastermost houses, which stand within in the land, then are you upon the Bar or shoale, then goe in south and s. by east right with the Castle Portugalletto, and alongst close by the Castle, and anchor a little within the Castle for a west winde. But when you are before the Barre, the Pilots come off and bring you to the Town.</P>
<P>When you lie without in the Bay, then you may see Mount Anthony lie w. and by north from you.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Bilboa to Castro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Castro.</NOTE> the course is w. 5 leagues, that is a good haven for 6, 7 and 8 fathom depth. The narrow of the haven lieth in south, in 10 fathom. But further in the river towards the towne, it is not deeper then 3 or 4 fathom.</P>
<P>From Bilbao to the hill of S. Anthonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. An∣thony.</NOTE> it is w. and by north nine or ten leagues. From Castro to Laredo, the course is west distant five leagues, upon the west side lyeth the foresayd hill of S. Anthonies, which is a high hill, men may sayle in close alongst by it untill they come about the east poynt; within it is wide and broad, and a fit haven for great shippes, there men may anchor in seven or eight fathom. To the eastwards over against the hill of S. Anthonies, in the middest of the sound, lyeth a rane of rockes under water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suncken Rocks.</NOTE> where men may sayle in about it on both sides, men may easily espy them, because it doth alwaies breake upon them, within them is the road for ordinary ships, a little before the haven, which is built with a wall. But the great shippes, lye a little fur∣ther off in 6 or 7 fathom depth. On the south side of the haven is a little tyde-haven, from the same there com∣meth a great riffe shooting off from the east side, towards the hill of S. Anthonies; within it is two fathom water right before the village, from the village commeth a tay∣le of sand, lying thwart out, within it at low water it is a fathom deepe. In the middest of the sound it is nine fathom, and at the poynt of Saint Anthonies 20 fathom deep.</P>
<P>From S. Anthonies hill to Cape de Kesgo<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Kesgo.</NOTE> it is west and w. and by s. 2 leagues, that is a great Cape lying to the eastwards of S. Andero: thwart of it is clean ground.</P>
<P>From Cape de Kesgo to the west poynt of S. Andero. it is w. &amp; by s. 5 leagues, a little to the s. wards of the point of S. Andero,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Andero</NOTE> upon the e. poynt of Sardinis, is a sand-bay, there is good anchoring in ten fathom.</P>
<P>From C. de Kesgo to the haven of S. Andero, the course is w.s.w. distant 2 great leagues. S. Andero lieth within a Bay, there lyeth an Island before the haven, men may go about it on both sides, it is deepe 8 &amp; 9 fa. but to the s. wards of the Island it is deep 5, 6, &amp; 7 fathom, accor∣ding as men will come near to the strand, the haven lieth in first w.n.w. The Island lieth a great league within the bay: from the east point of the haven, unto the west point of the land, it is south and north about a great league. S. Anthonies and the west point of S. Andero, lie one from the other e. and w. about 5 leagues.</P>
<P>For to know the land when you fall with the land a∣bout Laredo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laredo.</NOTE> you must know that on the w. side of the haven of Laredo, lyeth the hill of S. Anthonies, which is a very high hill, which men may see very farre from the e. and the w. &amp; a little above the towne of Laredo, men may see alsoo a sharpe hill like the poynt of a Diamond, or the poynt of a two hand sword, further it is about Laredo very high double land, two, three, and at some places foure double. The hill of S. Anthonies doth arise in two high hommockes, with a valley or sad∣dle in the middest betwixt them both within in the land lye also two high hills with sharpe topps. Above and to the w. wards of S. Anthonies, lyeth a piece of land judged to bee about two leagues long, which lyeth in five hills, the eastermost is the lowest, and rise all higher and higher towards the west, so that at the last to the westermost is the highest, which goeth off somewhat flat downward towards the west. Betwixt that eastermost hill and S. Anthonies, lyeth a bay about a league long, called the Bay of Port,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of Port.</NOTE> men cannot see these foresayd hills when they are close by the land, but they must be a good wa∣yes off to seawards.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="223"/>
<P>To the westwardes of these foresayd hills lyeth an other peece of land, which at the east end is highest, and goeth sloping off towardes the west end, allmost like Portland. Betwixt that poynt and the five foresayd hills, lyeth an other sand-Bay, where abouts stand some little houses, but by it lye many rockes &amp; fowle ground. There abouts within the land lyeth the foresayd high round sharpe hill in forme like the poynt of a sword.</P>
<P>S. Andero hath but few hills that are easy to be knowne but when men are before the haven, then they shall see to the eastwards of the towne, a Castro upon a high hill, in forme like a Sugerloafe, or a hay-cock, and to the eastwards of it is much double land of two and three heights double. But when men come about the Cape de Kesgo, then they shall see presently the castle upon the west land.</P>
<P>From S. Andero to Cape de Pinas, the course is w. or a little more no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therly 31 or 32 leagues. Betwixt them both lye these havens following.</P>
<P>First the haven of S. Martin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Martin.</NOTE> or Settevilles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settevills.</NOTE> a tyde-haven lying east and west 4 leagues from S. Andero.</P>
<P>From thence to S. Vincent<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Vincent</NOTE> alsoo a tyde-haven is five leagues distant: the haven goeth in on the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st side; from the west side commeth shooting off a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le riffe, and in the midst of the havens mouth lyeth a little Island, where men may goe in on both sides.</P>
<P>From S. Vincent to Lhanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lhanes.</NOTE> a tyde-haven, the course is west 2 or 3 leagues. Upon the west side of the haven standeth a little Church: and a little within the haven, lyeth a middle plate or sand, men must go in on the w. side of the sand: these are all narrow havens, &amp; but little knowne.</P>
<P>From Lhanes to Rio de Sella, the course is w. 5 or 6 leagues: betwixt them both lye alongst the coast many rocks, &amp; within them many sand-bayes, where men for need might save ships.</P>
<P>Hee that will goe into Rio de Sella<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio de Sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</NOTE> must look out for a mast which stands upon the east land close by the same men must goe in, the west side is within fowle, within the mast men must anchor before the village: this is also a tyde-haven.</P>
<P>From Rio de Sella to Villa Viciose<NOTE PLACE="marg">Villa Viciosa.</NOTE> it is west, 9 leagues, this is also a tyde-haven, but is clean, the havens mouth lyeth in s.s.e. and s.e. and by s. close alongst by the west poynt of the land, the east side is fowle unto the middest of the haven: there lyeth a rock with a plate right in the midst of the haven, which at low water fall dry: so soon as men are within that rock, they must anchor within the rock; upon the west side lyeth the towne, men may alsoo sayle up to it, &amp; anchor there in the shoale water.</P>
<P>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x leagues to the westwards of Villa Viciosa lyeth the out-poynt of Sanson,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanson.</NOTE> to the eastwards of it lyeth a little Island, where upon standeth a little Tower. Betwixt Sanson and the foresayd little Island is a good road in six or seven fathom.</P>
<P>At the west side of Sanson is alsoo a good road right before the little haven of Sanson in 6 or 7 fathom.</P>
<P>To the westw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdes of Sanson lyeth Gion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gion.</NOTE> with a Piere or Head that is paled off, under the which the Fisher∣men which dwell there, lay theyr barkes.</P>
<P>A great league to the westwards of Gion lyeth the Bay of Tores, a good road for a southwest and west wind in 8 and 9 fathom. Upon the poynt standeth a high tower.</P>
<P>Three leagues to the westwards of Tores<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tores.</NOTE> lyeth Cape de Pinas, where many rockes lye off to seawards, at least a halfe league of, some doe say that men may sayle through betwixt the poynt &amp; these rockes.</P>
<P>From the cape de Pinas<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. de Pi∣nas.</NOTE> lyeth off a rane of rockes, lying at the least a halfe league into sea, some say that men may sayle through betwixt the point and these rockes. But a little within or to the westwards off the Cape de Pinas, lyeth a great rock, betwixt that rocke and the land men may sayle through.</P>
<P>When men are within the Cape de Pinas, then lyeth Avilles three leagues from thence southsouthwest which is a good tyde-haven, where a great shippe may well goe in at halfe flood, alsoo there is a good road before this haven in 6 and 7 fathom.</P>
<P>For to sayle in there, men must goe in by the e. land, the west-land is farre off shoale, there standeth a little Chappell upon the east-land, men must sayle in close by it, and anchor a little wayes within two rockes that lye on the east side, a little within the havens mouth. The towne lyeth a league further up. From the west poynt runneth off a riffe, and lyeth inwards alongst the haven, towardes the town, so that it is there very shoale on both sides. On the west side without the haven in the bight, lye 2 great rockes right before the little Church in the Sand-bay, men sayle round about them, but it is not very cleane: but without the rocks good anchor ground in 7 or 8 fathom, over against the little Church that stan∣deth against the high land.</P>
<P>From Avilles<NOTE PLACE="marg">Avilles.</NOTE> to Luarca<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luarca.</NOTE> is 6 leagues and from Luarca to Ribadeus w.s.w. 6 leagues, &amp; from Aviles to Ribadeus s w. and by w. 12 leagues.</P>
<P>From the east poynt off the havens mouth of Riba∣deus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ribadeus.</NOTE> lyeth off a ledge or riffe off rocks towards the w. shoare, you may found in about it in foure fathom, or foure fathom and a halfe: or else if you keepe the little towne Castropoll even without the poynt, so sayle right in with it, then you shall not come too neere the fore∣sayd ledge, but you shall sayle far enough alongst to the westwards off it. The w. poynt sheweth it selfe when you come in out of the sea, like an Island; upon it at the nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h end standeth a flat tower, allmost like the tower in the Groyne, but not so great. About thwart off that Tower lyeth a suncken rocke a little wayes from the land, you must look out for it, and take heed off it, when there commeth in any great sea, you can easily espye it by the breaking of the sea upon it, but not with smooth water: at the very lowest water it commeth even with the water. The w. shoare is fowle and rocky: there runneth off to the southwards of the fotesayd Tower also a fowle ledge or riffe off rockes, at least halfe wayes over the havens mouth, and at the side of it you cannot use the lead. When you are past the ledge or riffe that lyeth off from the east shoare, you must run in about it, and edge in somewhat to the e. shoare, and sayle in alongst by it untill that you are past, or come to the end of the foresayd ledge or riffe off rockes, which lyeth off from the west shoare, as soone as you shall bee past it, you must luffe up about it towards the west shoare, for to give the e. shoare (within the havens mouth) a birth, which is a great wayes within very flat or shoale, but on the w. side it is deep water. There standeth a little Tower on the w. shoare a little within the point, where the riffe lyeth off, which you shall see when you are come within the west poynt, and run alongst by the riffe, when you get that little tower w. or thwart of you, then are you at the end of the riffe, then you must sayle towards that lit∣tle Tower, untill that you come to the w. shoare, and run in alongst by it, untill you come before the Towne, there you must lye with an anchor to seawards, and with a cable fast on the rockes.</P>
<P>A little league to the w. wards of Ribadeus lyeth a tyde-haven, he that commeth from the w. alongst by the shoare thwart of it, should lightly thinke that to bee the haven of Ribadeus, but it is light to discerne from it by these markes following. On both sides of this tyde-haven are the coasts all high land, but on both sides of the havens mouth of Ribadeus, it is low land. Also there lyeth a high sharpe hill &amp; very easy to be knowne, which ariseth out above all other hills thereabouts, which may bee knowne at least 7 or 8 leagues off, upon it lye some heapes of stones appearing like little houses when that you have that hill s.s.w. from you, sayle in so right with it, then you shall bee with the land right before the havens mouth of Ribadeus.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="223"/>
<P>Northwest from Ribadeus about 8 leagues, lyeth the Cabo de Brilo, a little to the westwards of it lyeth the little towne Viverus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Viverus.</NOTE> To the westwardes off the Bay off Cyspriaen (where men may anchor in ten fathom) lye two great high rockes: w. north w. from these rockes about a halfe league lyeth the Island S. Cyprian, right before the haven of Viverus, whereby this haven is easy to beknowne you may sayle about on both sides off this Island into the haven off Viverus, in all alongst in the middle of the channell south and south and by w. untill you come before the town, being within, you may anchor where you will either on the e. or w. side, it is there shoale water of 5, 6, 7, &amp; 8 fathom, according as you run farre in.</P>

<P>Betwixt both, a league to the westwardes of Viverus, lyeth the little towne of S. Marcus with a Bay, there men may anchor in 7 or 8 fathom, and ride for a s.s. w. and w. windes.</P>
<P>Two great leagues to the westwardes of S. Marcus lyeth the river of Caryns, there is also good anchoring, and from thence forth unto the Castle of Ortegall; all the coast alongst it is there every where cleane. From Caryns to Ortegall, the course is northwest, five leagues. Orte∣gall is a great poynt lying out, to the eastwards of it, men may lye land-lockt for a northwest, w.southwest, and south winde, thwart of the castle is the best road, there men may anchor in 8 or 9 fathom: When men come from the e.

This haven is so narrow in the comming in, that you may cast a stone upon the land on both sides, and in that narrow it is 20 fathom deepe. When you are in the havens mouth, you may see through betwixt the Island Sisarga, and the maine land to the s. wards of it.</P>
<P>To sayle from Feroll to the Groyne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sayle into the Groyne.</NOTE> the course is south, and south and by west 3 leagues, when you come neere the westland, you must give it a birth, at least of foure or five Cables lengths, because it is not very cleane.

On the south side of Blydones is the right fareway for to sayle into Ponte Vedra, this haven lyeth in northeast untill within the Island; somewhat further in the midst on the haven lieth also another little Island, which you must also goe to the southwards of, therefore goe in eastnortheast alongst by south-land, untill that you see the flat tower which standeth upon the south-land, and then you must run over a banck, right on with the poynt of Ponte Vedra, within it lyeth the towne, twhart off the flat tower men may anchor in 8 or 9 fathom: This haven is at some places foure fathom deepe.</P>

When you come neere the Castle, then come not very neere the shoare, which is not very cleane, and when, as then you come thwart of the innermost poynt of the Castle before that you begin to see the Towne of Bayone, from behind the poynt, you must looke well out before you: for from that same innermost poynt, and from the Castle, there lyeth off a suncken rock about halfe a cables length from the foresayd poynt, whereupon remaineth at low water no more then nine or ten foote water, keepe therefore (thwart off it) somewhat off from the poynt.

<HEAD>The sixth Demonstration, Where in Are shewed the Coasts of Portugal, from Camina to Passage.</HEAD>
<P>SEven leagues to the southwards of Camina lyeth Viana<NOTE PLACE="marg">Viana.</NOTE> upon a river. From the north poynt lyeth off a ledge off rockes thwart over before the mouth of the river, and upon the south shoare, stand two Fire-towers. If you will sayle in to this river off Viana, comming from the northwards, or out of the sea, then ran so long to the southwards untill that the two foresayd Fire-towers upon the south side of the rivers mouth, come one to the other, and then run in right with them towards the strand, untill that the little Tower upon the north-land come over the two houses; keep them one to the other, and runne then to the rock with the mast, and sayle alongst close to the eastward of it, and then you run in alongst over the Barre or the shoalest of the rivers mouth, there is at low water with an ordinary tyde two fathom depth. When you are past the foresayd rock with the mast then you shall see yet a head another rock with a mast or beacon, which lyeth on the north side of the river: run in like wise close alongst to the southwards of it, and afterwards indiffe∣rent close alongst by the north-land, untill you come before the Town, there runneth of sometimes a little riffe which you must give a birth to, and anchor before the town. When you lye before the towne, there lyeth a little Island to the southwards of you, where upon standeth a little Chappell: to the westwardes of that little Island lyeth a great Banke, which at low water is unco∣vered, behind that banck it is five and sixe fathom, and before Viana seven, eight, and nine fathom deepe; when you come in, they may run in about to the southwards of this foresayd Banck, and come out again before the town, by the little Island, where the little house stan∣deth upon.</P>
<P>When you come in about a bow shot within the second rock with the mast, there you may well let fall your anchor and bring Cables on the south shoare, and moore there by foure cables.</P>
<P>Men may anchor without in the road in 12 fathom, there is the cleanest ground for to take in a Pilot. It is a narrow and dangerous barre for to come into.</P>
<P>From Viana to Port a Port, the course is south &amp; by east 12 or 13 leagues, betwixt both lyeth Villa del Conde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Villa del Conde.</NOTE> seven leagues from Viana and from Metelyn. Villa del Conde is a broad haven, before the haven mouth lye many rockes, where men may sayle in about them on both sides, to the northwards or to the southwards of them it is five and sixe fathom deepe; further in lyeth a banck thwart over the haven of two fathom at high water: within in the haven it is 3 or 4 fathom deepe, on the n. side it is all full of rocks, which lye most under water, but on the south side it is deepest &amp; surest, and good lying in five and sixe fathom.</P>
<P>Foure leagues to the southwardes of Villa del Conde lye out the great rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rockes.</NOTE> called Lesons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lesons.</NOTE> right before a little Broad haven of two fathom depth, called Metelyn, and southwest from the south poynt of the foresayd roc∣kes Lesons; about a halfe league to seawards, lyeth a suncken rock under water: betwixt the land &amp; the Le∣sons it is 6 and seven fathom deep.</P>
<P>A league to the southwardes off the rockes Leson lyeth Port a Port.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Port a Port.</NOTE> From the north poynt of the rivers mouth lye off many rockes, allmost thwart over the channell. For to sayle in there, you must run in close alongst to the southwardes of the outermost rock, even so neere by it that you may cast with a stone upon it. There standeth a little Chappell upon the north shoare right against the rock with the crosse, and also a little white house upon the north shoare somewhat further up upon the river, bring them one in the other, and run in so right with them untill you bee past the Castle. In sayling in so, you shall not finde lesse upon the shoalest of the Barre, then 17 or 18 foot water at halfe flood, &amp; shall not come too neere a suncken rock, which lyeth without in the rivers mouth, somewhat neerer the south shoare thē the north, whereupon there remaineth at low water no more then 11 or 12 foote water. Being within the Castle, goe then right towardes the rock with the crosse, and so close alongst to the southwards of it, that you may reach it with a boat hoock, or els you must run in three or 4 ships lengths to the the south∣wards off it, or alongst by the south-land, untill you bee past the rock with the crosse, for to avoyd a suncken rock, which lyeth thwart of it a little to the southwards of it, and at low water is no more then eight foot under water. Being a little past the rock with the crosse, go then up alongst in the middle of the channell, untill you come thwart of a great white Tower upon the north-land, there you may anchor in 4 or 5 fathom, or sayle before the Towne, here it is 3 &amp; 4 fathom deepe. A little past the rock with the crosse is a shoale, whereupon remaineth at low water no more then 11 foot water, so that with shippes that draw 12 foote water, men must stay for high water, it floweth there six foot up and downe with an ordinary tyde.</P>
<P>On the south side of the river goeth in also a Land-d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep to the southwards of the foresayd suncken rock, which lyeth in the rivers mouth, where the Pilots sometimes bring shipps in and out, that is a good chan∣nell, and oftentimes it is east too againe of the sea, so that there is no certainty to be written of it, that men should trust upon.</P>
<P>From Port a Port to Avero, the course is south, ten leagues: betwixt them both it is all alongst a cleane sand∣strand, where men may be bold to come neere the shoare every where in ten or twelve fathom.</P>
<P>Within the land upon the high land lyeth a black hommock in the land, when that lyeth eastsoutheast from you, then you are open before Avero: when you cannot see the black hommock Carmole, then lyeth there a rough sand-hill to the northwards of the Barre, when that is thwart of you, then are you a halfe league to the northwards of the Bar of Avero.</P>
<P>If you will sayle in over the Barre of Avero, and that you come before it in sixe or seven fathom, then take heed to three beakons made off mast, which stand upon the south-land, bring them one in the other, and sayle in so right with them east and by south, and e.s.e. in over the barre, there is comming in, at halfe tyde, no more then two fathom water, untill rhat you come by the beakons, you shall so (being come within the poynts) sayle alongst by a dry sand on the larboard side, edge then up northnortheast, and northwest about by that foresayd dry sand, untill you come close to the norther land, and run in by it, and then you shall leave all the other shoals on the starboard side, untill that you see the river open, and then you shall see a little house upon the strand on the west side, goe then from thence up into the river, east and by south, and eastsoutheast, keeping the middle off the channell betwixt the two lands, untill you come before the Saltponds or Avero, where you may lade your ship with salt.</P>

<P>The Cape de Montego is a high poynt, and within it in the land are high mountains. The Cape is sometimes taken to be the Rock, but is easie to be discerned from it, because of the Burlings, which lye here to the s. wards, &amp; to the n. wards of the rock.</P>
<P>The Cape de Montego lyeth from Avero s.s.w. distant 7 leagues: a league to the southwards off it lyeth Pissa¦ge, or the River of Montego, a broad haven.

Upon the north side within the havens-mouth standeth a lime kilne, with a wood of Fig-trees, when you bring them one in the other, and then saile so right in with them, you runne in right in the channell, there is somtimes no more then twelve or thirteene foot water at a halfe flood: you may not certainly trust to the description of this haven; for in regard it is there sand-ground, it doth shift sometimes with the great Freshut that come off the River, and alsoo with stormes out of the sea. From Cape de Montego to Peniche, or Nova Lisbona, (at the Cabo del Fisiron, which is the poynt within the Burlings) the course is southwest and by south ten leag. there lyeth of a rock from the poynt, to the southwards of it is a great bay, where men may runne in behind it with barks, &amp; lye landlockt.

<P>A great league to the eastwards of the poynt of Rox∣ent, or the Rock, lyeth the road of Cascalis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cascalis.</NOTE> where men may lye land-lockt for a northwest, north, &amp; northeast winde, in 12 or 13 fathom, so deep or shoale as they will. A great league to the eastward of Cascalis, lyeth the poynt of S. Julian, or S. Gillians<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Gillians or S. Gilliens</NOTE> whereupon standeth a strong castle, that is the north poynt of the River of Lisbone, the norther channell of the River goeth in within a bowles cast alongst by it.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the norther channell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sayle in at the nor∣ther chan∣nell.</NOTE> you must run in, alongst within the length off a mast alongst by the foresayd point, but comming before the castle of S. Gillians, you must edge somewhat over towards the Carrick deepe, for to avoyd some fowle ground and rocks, which lye on the east side of the Castle. Being past that a little, you may luffe up againe towardes the northter shoare and sayle alongst by it to Restiers, &amp; so forth even to Lisbone, men doe commonly anchor before the Village of Bolyn in twelve or thirteen fathom. Men must take heed not to come into this channell with calme weather, and with an ebbe, which falleth very strong upon the norther Cachops: this channell of S. Gillians lyeth in east and by south; being within, you must sayle up e. n. e. and n. e. &amp; by east, and when you come against the Abbey at Restier, then you must edge somewhat over towards the south-land, els you must keepe the northland alongst.</P>
<P>For to sayle into the Carrick deep,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to sayle in at the Car∣rick deepe</NOTE> you shall bring Cascalis, over the west-poynt of Roxent, &amp; keepe it so, untill that the little Tower (which you shall see stand above the Abbey at Restiers) come over the white Ab∣bey which standeth the farthest from Restier, to wit, over S. Katherines Abbey or Cloyster, goe then north∣e, &amp; n. e. &amp; by n. in keeping these marks standing thus, untill that you come within the poynt off S. Gillies, and then goe in alongst by the north-land to Restiers within the Castle, and anchor there where you thinke it best. Upon these markes you may sayle in and out at the Carrick deepe. If you come from the westwardes and will goe in to the Carrick deepe, then bring Cascalis over the west-end of Roxent, and sayle so about the norther Cachops, untill that the Town off Lisbone come within two ships lengths neere to the southside of the River, &amp; then further in northeast and by north, when as then you shall see the sand-bay within the poynt of S. Gillians, then are you in the righ fareway.</P>
<P>But if it should happen, that you could not see the towne, or the little Tower, then keep the sand-bay (which lyeth within S. Gillians poynt north e. land by north from you and sayle so n. e. &amp; n. e. &amp; by north in, and take the sounding of the norther Cachops in eight or nine fathom: when you begin to come against S. Gil∣lians poynt, sayle then indifferent close along by the northland, as is before sayd.</P>
<P>He that will turne out or in to the Carrick deepe, must bring the foresayd little tower that standeth within the land, a shipps length to the s. wards, &amp; a shipps length to the northwardes off the foresayd Abbey or Cloyster off S. Katherines, and then cast about every time, and so turne too and againe out and in.</P>
<P>Also come not with calmes in this channel, (neither bound inwards nor outwards) with an ebbe, for it falleth very strong over the east end of the Cachops.</P>
<P>If you will run out at the Carrick deepe, you must looke out for the foresayd little Tower: when it commeth out from under that high land, bring it then a little to the westwardes of the second white Abbey or Cloyster, and goe away southwest and by south, and then the little tower shall come to the Cloyster.</P>
<P>But if you must turne out too and again, then you must be very carefull of your tydes, for the streames fall strong over the Cachops, so that it is very dangerous with calmes to come in or out at those channels, but especially in sayling out with an ebbe, for it falleth thwart over the Cachops.</P>
<P>From Roxent to S. Uves poynt, the course is southeast &amp; by s. 10 leag. that is also a apoynt easy to be known, by a high round hill which lyeth on it, also men shall see the top of the castle of Sisembre upon a flat hill like a great top or ridge of a countrey house.</P>
<P>S. Uves poynt is called Cape de Pitcher▪ &amp; by the Dutchmen Cape de Spichel, a little to the southwards about the poynt, is a rent or clift in the land, before it is good riding in 9 and 10 fathom. Before Sisember men may also anchor in 15 or 16 fathom.</P>

<P>From S. Uves to Cape. S.

When the Castle of Chipiona and the Church beginne to come one in the other, then you come to the first rocks or shoals, when the Church and Castle are right one over the other, then they stand southsouthwest from you, then you are upon the shoalest of all, but when the Castle with the Church come againe one through the other, then you get againe deeper water, 3 fathom and a halfe, and 4 fathom at low water with a neepe tyde, sayle in alongst upon the foresayd markes of the cloyster and the tree, but take good heed that you bring not the tree over the Quire, at the south end off the cloyster, for you should then come very close to the rockes, rather bring the tree a little to the north∣wards of the cloyster, for you can not lightly take hurt of the red sand-hils, but you may borrow off them upon your lead in 3, and 4, fathom. There stands also a mill to the eastwards of the towne, take heed that you bring not that also over the round Cloyster that standeth a little to the eastward beneath at the towne, but keep them a handspikes length asunder, and then you sayl in the best deep. But if the foresayd mill, and that round Cloyster come one in the other when you sayle in, then you shall (without sayle) come upon the rocks or shoals When you are within over the shoalest, sayl then towards the strand of S. Lucas, untill that you see alto∣gether open into the river, for to avoyd the riffe that shooteth off from the n.w. poynt of the river, sayle on alongst by the shoare and anchor before the little Church with the crosses (which stands below in the sand hills) in 5, 6, or 10, or 12, fathom, so neere as you please Men may also turn our at this same channell with indif∣ferent ships or barks, but they must take good heed, it is not there very broad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">For to saile alongst by Sipiona.</NOTE>There goeth in also a channell by the land of Sipionen or Chipiona, for to find it, you shall sayle in within two cables lengths neer by the foresayd land, untill that you be within the second shoale, then you must edge some∣what off from the land, untill you come upon the fore∣sayd marks off the Cloyster and the great tree, then you must run in alongst upon them, as is before taught. The river of S. Lucas is easy to know, by the Rooduyn, or red sand-hills which lye to the westwards of it.</P>
<P>From Sipione to Cales Males, the course is s.e. 9 leag. Cales<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cales.</NOTE> is knowne by the mountaine off Granade, when that is eastnortheast and east and by north from you, sayle then right in with it, and you shall not sayle to fall right before Cales. At the poynt off Sipona lye many rocks above water, and betwixt the poynt of Sipiona Cales. Foure leagues from Sipiona lyeth Rotta, there shooteth off a great ledge of rocks from the poynt.</P>
<P>Hee that will goe into the bay of Cales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to saile into the bay off Cales.</NOTE> let him run in right with the rockes which lye on the west-side of the Bay, being called los Puercos,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Los Puer∣cos.</NOTE> and within two cables lengths in all alongst by them in 6 or 7 fathom, untill he come before the town of Cales, and anchor there so deep as he pleaseth, in 8, 10, 12, or 15 fathom, the faire∣way lyeth in most eastsoutheast and southeast and by east.</P>
<P>There lyeth a rock under water, called the Diamant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diamant.</NOTE> about n.n.e. and n. e. and by north from the Puercos, a great half league. When S.

But set the two high hills which are to the southwards of the way of Sheres, that they bee a little asunder, and that they doe not come one in the other, then you cannot sayl upon this rock. The Puercos rock lye from the north-poynt off Cales about halfe a league. He that lies before Cales in the road, hath Puntall south from him, or there abouts, according as he lyeth neer to Cales.

<P>The Bay of Cales is wyde and broad, men lye there in 5 &amp; 6 fathom, the northwest wind commeth there open in. If any man therefore would goe further in behind Puntall, let him goe in southeast betwixt the poynt of Port Real &amp; Puntall, and run up about the poynt of Puntall, there men lye land-lockt for all windes: there mē may lay theyr ships dry a ground for to make cleane. He that will goe into the Creek, must take a Pilot, and run up into the water of Port Real leaving the little Island on the larboard side, and then Herods Creeck shall open it selfe, and there hee must sayle up keeping the middle of the channell, till he come before the Saltheaps.</P>
<P>For to sayl from Cales to the Strait,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To sayle from Ca∣les to the Strait.</NOTE> men must goe away south, and south and by east to the C. de Trafalgar and then they shall run far enough without the bancke or rocks which lye off s. east from Cales. From the point of S. Sebastian to Cape de Trefalgar, which is the north poynt of the Strait on the west side it is s. s. east, ten leagues. About two leagues to the northwards of the Cape, lyeth Conil, there is a faire sand-bay, where men may anchor in 12, 13, and 14 fathom clean ground.</P>
<P>Hee that desireth to sayle into the Straite of Gibralter comming from Cales, let him goe from the poynt of S. Sebastian, which is the westermost poynt of the Island Cales, south &amp; by east, southsoutheast, towards the Cape de Trafalgar, untill he be a good wayes without the land for to avoyd the Spanish coast which is fowle: there lyeth of west &amp; by south from the Island Tariffe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe off Tariffe.</NOTE> a banck of stones 2 leagues, or two leagues and a halfe into sea, whereupon is eight, nine, or ten foote water, when it bloweth hard, men may see it break.

<P>When you are then somewhat without the Cape de Trafalgar, and set your course s.s.e. and s.e. and by south then you shall fall with the land off the Barbary coast, within the Cape de Spartell, about thwart off Tanger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanger.</NOTE> lying in a great bight and sand-bay. Upon the west poynt of this bay of Tanger, standeth a Castle somewhat high, and yet somewhat higher upon the high land, standeth a little watch-tower: but to the eastwards of Tanger standeth alsoo an old ruinous watch-tower, whereby Tanger is very easy to be knowne. From Tanger to Ape-hill, the coast lyeth most e.n.e, and e. &amp; by north, is the right course for to sayle through the Strait. If you will sail into the Strait by night, then keepe to the Barbary coast, which is very cleane, and there you can take no hurt: but the Spanish coast is fowle, as is befote sayd. They that will sayle alongst by the Spanish coast, they must goe close alongst by the shoare, and runne through betwixt the Island Tariffe and the foresayd fowle grounds, close alongst by the Island, or els must keepe farre off from the Island, for to runne alongst without the shoals; but in the middest, neere a like unto both lands it is best.</P>
<P>Three leagues to the eastwards of the Island Tariffe lyeth the poynt of Cabrita,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape de Cabrita.</NOTE> being the west poynt of the great Bay of Gibraltar over against the hill of Gibral∣ter: a little to the w. wards of it, is a good road for a n. e. wind, in 12, 10 &amp; 8 fathom, not farre from the shoare,

<P>At Gibraltar is a faire Bay almost like a haven: if you will anchor in the bay of Gibraltar, then saile so farre into it, untill that innermost point of the hill of Gibralter, doe stand east from you, thereabouts it is deepe 5 or 6 fathom, and clean ground: towards the mill it is shoal water of 3 fathom. Men lye there in the Bay landlockt for a w. wind, a s. winde commeth from the poynt of Gibraltar hill, but a southwest wind that bloweth there open in. From thence are brought good wines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay off Gibraltar.</NOTE>When you will set saile from the road of Gibraltar with an easterly wind, it is good to beare up somewhat before the wind towards the west shoare, &amp; then forth out alongst by the lee shoare, for the easterly winds do fall with such whirling &amp; fore-slaughes from over the high land of Gibraltar, that you shall be hardly able to get out of the Bay alongst by the high land. When you come from the eastwards, &amp; will sayle out through the Straits, and that you are somwhat neere to the Spanish coast, then you must be very carefull, for that you bring the hill of Gibraltar, against the high land of Barbary, &amp; in regard the land to the northwards of Gibraltarhil is low, it seemeth (to look to) to be nothing els, then as if there were the opening of the Straites. It hath hereto∣fore happened, that some which have so mistaken it, have sayled into the bay, thinking it to be the opening of the Strait, &amp; so have lost their ships there. Therefore it is very needfull, that men take great care not to mistake them selves of the hill of Gibraltar, &amp; if men do take heed of it, it is easy to bee knowne.</P>
<P>Estepona lieth 5 leagues to the eastwards or to the northwards of Gibraltar, betwixt them both stand divers firetowrs upon the coast, there is clean ground for to anchor. If you will anchor to the eastwardes of Gibraltar, by the next tower of Gibraltar, then bring Gibraltar southsouthwest from you, and anchor in 25 fathom, there is cleane ground, &amp; blacksand but if you will anchor by the second firetower, there is a valley, &amp; there you may fetch water, and anchor in 20 or 22 fathom, there is a valley, and there is also clean ground, and better lying for to set sail with easterly winds, for those that are bound out of the Strait. Before Estepona, men may anchor in 14 fathom, that is a place for to lade fruite and wines; 5 or 6 leagues to the eastwards of it lieth Marveles, betwixt them both stand 5 watch towers upon the coast.</P>
<P>From Gibraltar to Marveles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marveles.</NOTE> the course is n.e. and by north distant 12 leagues, if you will anchor at Marveles, then you must look out for two Pack-houses which stand upon the strand and a great square watch-tower close to the eastwardes off the foresayd Pack-houses: bring the gate of the towne so, that you may see through betwixt the Pack-houses and the watch-tower, and anchor there in nine or ten fathom. Right before Marveles, the ground is not cleane. About a shot of a Cast peece to the westwards of the town, men may fetch fresh water.</P>
<P>From Marveles to Fangerola<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fangerola</NOTE> it is 5 leagues eastnorth∣east betwixt them both stand also 5 watch-towers.

<P>Mallaga<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mallaga.</NOTE> is knowne by these markes: There standeth a Castle to the eastwards upon the high land, &amp; there come two walles downewards towards the sea to another Castle which lyeth by the water-side.

<P>If you will anchor in the road before Mallaga, then anchor in 10, 11, 12, or 14 fathom, thwart off from the head, if that the head come to lye from you north and by east, there is very good ground, the anchors hold there well, also men lye there out of danger for the Moores.</P>
<P>Velez Mallaga lieth from Mallaga east and by north distant 7 leag. betwixt them both men may anchor all alongst by the shoare. About a league to the westwards of Velez Mallaga standeth a little Castle; before it is good anchoring in 10 or 12 fathom.

<P>Two great leagues to the westwards of Almunecar lyeth a poynt, whereupon standeth a fire-tower, under is a good road for a west wind.</P>
<P>If you will anchor at Almunecar, then anchor to the westwards of the rock, where the little chappell standeth upon in twelve fathom, there is good ground, and shall lye there landlockt for an east &amp; westnorthwest wind.</P>
<P>Salobrena lyeth from Almunecar foure leagues to the eastwards, that is a little Towne with a little Castle, &amp; lieth upon a hill a little about the east poynt of Almu∣necar &amp; right before Salobrena lyeth a little Island, he that will anchor there must anchor to the westwards of it, there he shall lye landlockt for a northeast wind, and also for a west wind, then he shall have succour of the e. poynt of Almunecar. Men may also well anchor to the eastwards of that little Island, but too the westwards of it is the best road, there lye also all the ships, they may anchor there in fourteene and fifteene fathom, clean soft ground, in sixteene fathom they shall lye somewhat too farre out. Men may (if need so require) run through betwixt the foresayd little Island, &amp; the maine land be∣twixt them both there is about sixteen or senventeen foot water, and the little Island is round about clean, so that men may run very close alongst by it without feare.</P>
<P>Two great leagues eastwards from Salobrena in the same bight, a half league from the sea side within the land lyeth Modrill, which hath two Churches &amp; some trees, thereabouts upon the water side standeth a square tower.</P>
<P>If you will anchor at Modrill, then anchor before the foresayd square tower, which standeth upon the water side in twelve or thirteene fathom, so that you may see the little Tower upon the east poynt even without the other poynt, there is cleane ground, men lye there landlockt for an eastwind, but a south east &amp; a southwind make there (like as at all places on these coasts) a lee shoare.

<P>For to sayle out of the Bay of Gibralter to Tetuan, then run over south &amp; by east, about close by the point of Seuta, especially with a westerly winde, you should otherwise be carried away so with the current, which then commonly runs to the eastwards, that you should fall too farre to the Leewards. Comming then about by the point of Seuta, you shall see out a head a black point called cape Porkes lying south from the poynt of Seuta. When men lye in the Bay of Gibraltar, they may see the foresayd cape Porkes<NOTE PLACE="marg">C.

When you come about that poynt, then you shal begin to see Tetuan, which lieth up against the high land, a great league within the land: run then soo far to the s. wards, untill that the east end of the towne come right over a little round hommock, which is upon the high land within. In the middest off the towne standeth a black to∣wer, and in the innermost land of al within, lye three little hills, which doe (as it were) looke over the outer∣most inner land, bring the three little hills over the fore∣sayd black tower, &amp; anchor then so farre from the shoare that the first little hill of the high land to the south∣wards of Seuta towards cape Porques, come a little without Cape Porques, there it shall bee sixteen fathom deep, &amp; good soft ground.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marks of the Roade before Tetuan.</NOTE> If you anchor otherwise then upon these foresayd marks you shall have bad, stony &amp; sharpe ground. It hath happened that some ships have anchored there, but their anchors fell so into the rocks, that they could not weigh them again, but must hew of their cables, and leave their anchors behinde them. Therefore if you come off from the point of Cape Porques, then bee care full that you bring the foresayd first little hommock (which lyeth a stearn of you in the bight of Seuta to the southwards of Seuta) a little without the Cape Porques, and so keep sailing to the southward, and keep heaving of the lead continually without ceasing untill that you get the soft ground, so soone as you shall feele it, let then presently your anchor fal, for the place where the soft ground is, is not two cables length in compasse great.</P>
<P>Tetuan lyeth from Seuta about sixe leagues, and three or foure leagues to the southwards of it lyeth a point, called Cape Tetuan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Tetuan</NOTE> whereupon standeth a tower. He that hath never been at Tetuan, might easily be mistaken by that poynt, taking it to be cape de Porques, the sooner because that some say that Tetuan at least nine leagues to the southwards of Teutan. It hath happened that ships have sayled unto this poynt, and have so runne past Tetuan, therefore it is best that men goe not too farre from the shoare either by night or by day for to get the cape Porques certainly in sight.</P>
<P>The Bay off Tetuan betwixt the Cape Porques and Cape Tetuan, is a sand-bay altogether of sand-strand with low hommocks here and there upon the sea-side, which a farre of seeme as if they were shipps, but the ground thereabouts is altogether foule, except such a place as before is sayd. Betwixt the Cape Porques and Seuta it is also a faire sandstrand; but thwart of it is all good ground.</P>
<P>The Coast of Barbarie in the Straite of Gibralter, lyeth from Seuta to Cape de Spartell west and by south, and westsouthwest eight or nine leagues. But the Cape de Spartell, and Cape de Trafalgar on the Spanish side, lye north &amp; by west, and south and by east eight leagues asunder.</P>

A little to the southwards of the poynt of Cape de Spartell, men may anchor for easterly windes in twelve or thirteene fathom, cleane sand-ground, but so soone as the winde doth shift to the west they must bee ready to get under saile, lest they be inbayed upon a lee shoare.</P>
<P>About a league to the southwards of the Cape lyeth a little hommock upon the low land, by the water side, which sheweth (in sayling by) like a broken schonce or castle.</P>
<P>Arzyla is a little walled town, lying upon the water side, and hath a little bard haven, which men doe sayle into at two places through a row of Rockes, which lyeth before it, the northermost channell is the deepest, but both of them are not fit but for small shippes. Being come within the rocks, men doe anchor betwixt the town and the rockes.</P>
<P>From Arzyla to Alarache, the coast lyeth also south and by west eight leagues, it is altogether a cleane coast with some rocks on the shoare, the land betwixt them both is somwhat higher them betwixt Arzyla and the Cape with high land within. About an English mile to the southwardes of Arzyla standeth a tower, and som∣what further to the southwards, upon the high land, stand some little houses, but men cannot well see them, except they sayle close alongst by the coast. Betwixt Arzyla and Alarache, but somwhat neerer Alarache then Arzyla, lyeth on the sea side, a high white cliffe which is very easy to be known, betwixt that cliffe and
<PB N="97" REF="246"/> Alarache standeth upon the high land a very high tree, with some other trees by it, when men come from the northwards alongst by the shoare, that great tree seemeth to be a tower, yet somwhat to the southwards standeth an other great tree, but not so great as the other: when men begin to come neere to Alarache, or els by the southermost great tree, then the foresayd greatest tree doth hide it selfe behinde the land. These are all very good marks for to know this coast by, be∣twixt these two places.</P>
<P>Alarache lyeth with a great Castle upon the south poynt of a river, which is very shoale and crooked, the north poynt is a low poynt going flat off, and within it, on the n. side of the river standeth also some buildings. Before the river lyeth a barre of quicksand, which lyeth off from the north poynt, where ships may goe in over with a spring tyde, through a Creeke, els it is but for Barkes &amp; Friggats: men may anchor before it in the Roade in 16, 17, and 18 fathom.</P>
<P>Alarache<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alarache.</NOTE> is under the command of the King of Spaine, &amp; is little or nothing used either by English or Dutch∣men.</P>
<P>He that saileth alongst this coast, must not come very close to the shoare, unlesse it were with a hard Levand, or easterly winde, with calme weather there goeth sometimes a very great grown sea out of the west or northwest, so that somtimes men can hardly get off from the shoare.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Rom Old Mamora to Mamora,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mamora.</NOTE> the coast lyeth alongst south &amp; by west and southsouthwest 7 leag. Before Mamora is a high broad sandstrand, and is not easy to know, when you are somewhat off the land The best knowledge thereof is this: When you come from the northwards alongst the shoare, you have all high land within, that you come leese when you come before Mamora, and when you come from the northwards, you cannot see the river of Mamora open before you bee past it, by reason that it lyeth into the eastwards, &amp; the n. point is low. When you come somewhat close by the shoare, you shall see upon the high land in the Castle of Mamora (which the Spaniards have built there for the defence of the place) a very high mast or stake, which you may see indifferent far off, and when it is cleare weather you may see also the high thick Tower of Salley to the southwards stand against the land. Before the river lieth a Barre which with a Spring hath 16 &amp; 17 foote, and sometimes more water, the Barre is oftentimes altered by the sea. In the spring it lieth in commonly e.s.e. &amp; there abouts. In the later part of the yeare it lyeth in more easterly by the casting up of the sea out of the n. In the Summer the windes blow alongst the coast, the most part of the time out of the north, which causeth that the current run∣neth there to the southwards, &amp; in the winter they blow much &amp; strong out of the southwest and southsouthwest In the winter men must be very carefull to get of betimes when the winde beginneth to come to the south, or s.e. then it is time to get of, for then commonly it shifteth to the s. w. and w. s. w. with foule weather, but when it commeth about againe to the westnorth∣west or northwest, then it is like to be good weather againe.</P>
<P>The road before Mamora<NOTE PLACE="marg">Road be∣fore Ma∣mora.</NOTE> is about a league from the land in 18 and 20 fathom, there is clean sandy-ground.</P>
<P>From Mamora to Salley the coast lyeth s.w. &amp; by s. &amp; s.s.w. six leagues, bewixt them both it is low plaine land, and sandy-strand, with double land within, which is so even and smooth, as if it were planed over. From Mamora not halfe wayes to Sally, the strand ceaseth, and from thence forth to the southwards it is a shoare all of black steepe ragged rockes with little hills, so that men can∣not judge (when they are somewhat off the land) that it is double land within, by the plaines of it. When you are a league or two past Mamora, then you may see very plaine the high thick Tower of Sally, &amp; when you see the foresayd rocky shoare you may be sure that you are past Mamora, that steepe ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y shoare continueth from thence, untill past Fedalle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etwixt Fedalle and Sally is here and there a place of white strand, betwixt the rockes, but to the northwards of Salley it is not so, but nothing else then perfect rocks.</P>
<P>The Towne of Salley<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salley.</NOTE> hath a little Tower, and lyeth upon the n. side off the river, which is a low plain poynt of sand. The Castle hath also a little Tower, and lyeth over against upon the s. poynt of the River, which is a high rocky poynt. There goeth a wall round about the high thick Tower, and lieth upon a point on the s. side within the River. Before the River is a Barre which oftentimes with storms out of the sea doth alter and shift, and is cast too, sometimes the channell runneth by one of the two poynts, &amp; sometimes againe right in the middest of the rivers mouth. Hee that will anchor be∣fore Salley, let him bring the foresayd high thick Tower (which standeth within on the River) on the poynt of the castle, to wit, over the south point of the River, which shall then stand from him neere about south e. &amp; anchor there in thirty, eight and twenty, 24, 20, 18, or 16 fathom, so neere or farre off as he will there is clean black sandy-ground, neverthelesse that the shoare thereabouts is so full of rocks &amp; stones. Being come to anchor there men must shoot a shot to cause the Moores to come off. From Salley to the Island Fedalle the shoare lyeth alongst s.w. &amp; by s. about 9 or 10 leagues. betwixt them both lye here &amp; there in the sand-strand, long black rocks (as before is sayd) so that oftentimes men might take it to be Fedalle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fedalle.</NOTE> The best markes for to know Fedalle by is a wood of trees about a league to the northwards off Fedalle, which standeth below upon the land, and sheweth like a barne. When you come sayling alongst close by the land, you shall see it above
<PB N="100" REF="251"/> upon the land, but when you are somewhat off from the land, then you shall see the land within above the wood of trees, (or Barne as men doe commonly name it for the likenesse of it) also there lyeth a little round hommock about 4 leag. to the northwardes of Fedalle, which you shall see above the rest of the land, when you are some∣what off from the land, but when you come close by the land, it hideth it selfe also behinde the double land. The coast betwixt Salley and Fedalle, is very plain &amp; smooth double land, so that there is not another such hommock more betwixt them both, as that foresayd hommock, and in regard the coast thereabouts is altogether soo plain, without any places easy to be knowne, therefore men must take the more speciall heed unto such small markes, for not to saile past the place where they are bound unto.</P>
<P>Betwixt the foresayd Barne or wood of trees and Fe∣dalle standeth also a ruinous little Towne fallen downe, in a rough wood, called Monsor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsor.</NOTE> when you sayle alongst close by it, you shall see yet some peeces of walles of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Road un∣der Fedal∣le.</NOTE>To the s. wards of Fedalle the land is agayne higher, and where the high and low commeth together, it doth make a clift, thereby the Island of Fedalle is easy to be known, when that clift is s. s. e. from you, then is Fedalle thwart of it also s. s. e. from you. If you will goe into Fedalle, then runne right with the foresayd Barne, or wood of trees, untill you come within a league, or some∣what neere to the land, and then alongst by it, and so you shall not misse the Island Fedalle, but runne in be∣twixt it and the maine land, when as you come by the north poynt of Fedalle, then anchor betwixt the strand and the foresayd n. poynt, but much neerer the Island Fedalle then the strand in 6, 7 or 8 fathom, so that you come to lye with your shippe so farre in, that the fore∣sayd poynt of the Island doe lye n. n. w. from you, then lyeth the foresayd Barne e. n. e. from you, and Monsor a handspikes length to the n. wards of the Barn or wood of trees; you may also anchor in 12 fathom, so that the poynt of Fedalle lye w. and by s. from you.</P>
<P>This bight within the Island Fedalle, is a very bad place to lye in, for although you lye there so, that the poynt of the Island lye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. and n. and by w. from you, and with a Cable on t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Island, neverthelesse the grown sea commeth soo hard rowling in about the poynt of the Island (when the winde is westerly) that you might rather desire to lye in the open sea, then within the Island. From the n. poynt of Fedalle shooteth off a ledge or riffe of rockes a Musket shot into sea, the most o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them lye high above water; within the Island it is very flat towards the strand, the Bay on the land is a faire san∣dy strand, there men may get ballast from the shoare, but they must bee very carefull to stand upon their guard, for there are dangerous people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Depths &amp; grounds about Fedalle.</NOTE>Before Fedalle, to wit, to the northwards off it, thwart of the wood of trees, and alongst to Salley, it is all showld water a league or two from the land, all alongst that distance it is not deeper then 23, 24, and 25 fathom cleane sand-ground, thwart of into sea from Fedalle it is also of the same depth, but foule ground.</P>
<P>He that will trade at Fedalle must anchor somewhat farre in, for they have there no Boats, men must fetch the Moores aboard with the Boat.</P>
<P>Upon the n. point of Fedalle lieth a high hommock, which sheweth a far off when men come in, as if it were a castle falne down, but it is nothing else then rocks. At the s. end of Fedalle men may goe over on foot at low water to the maine land, but at high water the sea washeth through at 2 places, it floweth there 7 or 8 fo. up &amp; down,</P>
<P>Three leagues s. w. and by s. and s.w. from Fedalle lyeth an old ruinous town fallen downe close upon the strand called Anafee,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fee.</NOTE> it is a long town with many towers. amongst the rest one high thick tower almost like the tower of Salley, but men must bee indifferent close by it before you can see it. When you are thwart of Anafee, you may yet see the wood of trees to the northwards of Fedalle, which standeth then to see to from far as a saile in the water, 2 leag. to the southwards, (or rather to the westwards) of Anfee, or Anafee, is a steepe poynt with red cliffs, which seem a far off as if they where hou∣ses such spotters mē shall find at divers places on the coast.</P>
<P>From Anafee to Azamor<NOTE PLACE="marg">Azamor.</NOTE> the coast lyeth s.w. and by w. westerly 18 leagues betwixt them both lyeth another fallen place called Lyones. Azamor hath a poynt lying out on the east side, when you come sayling alongst the shoare from the northwards, Azamor lieth then about or behinde that poynt upon the strand, but standeth high. A little past Azamor lyeth a river, and thereabouts are some towers in the lowland.</P>
<P>Three little leagues to the westwards of Azamor lieth the town of Masagam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Masagam.</NOTE> on a white strand close by the sea side this town is inhabited by the Portugals, or Span∣jards, it hath no towers, and sheweth to see to off at sea, in white spots against the land. When you are thwart off from it, you shall see to the s. wards the high tower of Tyro<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyro.</NOTE> (which is a town fallen down about 2 leag. to the w. wards of Masagam) almost like the tower of Anafee. A little to the w. wards of Masagam, at the w. poynt of the Bay, shooteth off a ledge or riffe of rocks, almost a league off into sea, whereof the rockes at high water, lie most under water, and at low water are uncovered. He that will anchor there and is not well acquainted, must take in a Pilot, which may bring him to a place where is good anchor ground, for although that it be a great Bay, yet neverthelesse there are few places where the ground is clean; but is at many places foule, so that but few ships should be able to lie there in clean ground, when you lie in the right road, then lieth the e. point of the Bay e. and the w. point about n.w. from you.</P>
<P>About a leag. to the w. wards of Tiro lieth a steep point when you come from the e. wards alongst by the shoare, you shall see no more land without the point, untill that you come near it, when you begin to get it upon your broad side, then there commeth out to the westwards a great square cliff, which is very easy to be known, and is whitish with reddish spots, and seemeth a far off as if it were a wall. This point is called after that white poynt, C. Blanco.<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Blanco.</NOTE> About 3 leag. to the w. wards of this C. Blanco, standeth a little tower upon the highland, near by a valley called Casa Cavalgera,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Casa Ca∣valgera.</NOTE> and 2 leag. more to the w. wards lieth upon the high land another little house called Emin∣dra,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Emindra.</NOTE> but you must be close by the land before that you can see it. From the foresayd C. Blanco to the C. Cantin, the coast lyeth west s.w. and s.w. and by w. about 9 leag.</P>
<P>The C. Cantin<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Cantin.</NOTE> is an even plaine point, when you are to the n. wards of it, it sheweth flat towards the w. &amp; going off towards the sea: there standeth a fire-tower upon it, but very small, that sometimes you can hardly see it. If you come from the northwards, or from C. Vincent, and are bound to Saffia, then set your course south and s. and by east, and then you shall fall with the land 4 or 5 leag. to the e. wards of C. Cantin, or if you sayle a more westerly course you shall runne till you come in the height of 32 degr, &amp; a half, and then the C. Cantin shall lie due e. from you, it is better to fall a little to the east∣wards of the C. then to the w. wards of it, because the winds blow there most common northerly. If you fall to the eastwards of the C. the coast lyeth there s.w. and by w. and w. s. w. and it is even plaine land. About 10 leag. to the e. wards of the C. lieth that little town Tyro, with a high white tower upon the sea side, &amp; 5 or 6 leag. more to the westwards (betwixt Casa Cavalgero and C. Cantin) you shall see a little bight or Bay, thereabouts lie upon the strand by the water side, great black rockes, which shew as if they were wrakes of ships, and then forth alongst to the C. it is a faire flat sandy strand. From the C. shooteth off a ledge of rocks somewhat off into sea, which men must avoid when they sayle about the Cape.</P>
<P>From C. Cantin to the north poynt of Saffia, the coast lieth s. or somewhat more westerly, 5 or 6 leag. betwixt
<PB N="101" REF="251"/> them both it is a steep rocky land without sandy strand, but above upon it plaine and even. A league to the south∣wards of the C. lieth a riffe or shoale by the shoare, by some called the Gold-banke and lyeth about a league off from the land: at sometimes of the year there is much fish to be taken.</P>
<P>To the southwards of the Bay of Saffia<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saffia.</NOTE> is high uneven, and most of all double land, but to the southwards of it, it is even &amp; plain, thereby men may easily perceive or discern whether they be to the northwards of Saffia, or to the southwards of it.</P>
<P>If you will anchor in the bay<NOTE PLACE="marg">For to an∣chor in the Bay.</NOTE> or road before Saffia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saffia.</NOTE> then bring the north poynt (whereupon standeth a to∣wer) a little more westerly then n. from you, &amp; anchor then in 18 fathom. Or if you will anchor further in the Bay, then bring the foresayd north poynt n.n.w. or a little more northerly from you, and then the northermost of the two north points shall bee a shippes length without the southermost or the next unto you run then so farre to the southwards untill that the tower were men doe land with the boats (which is a high squa∣re tower standing below even within the wal of the tow∣ne) come right over a tower which is fast to the wall, which commeth off from the Castle above to the south∣wards, so that the foresaid thicke tower below come right over the Haven, betwixt the poynt where the castle standeth upon the water side, and the rocks where men goe in betwixt. Or else anchor that the high Castle of Saffia stand e. and by s. and e.s.e. from you, there it is 16, 17 and 18 fathom deepe, good fine sandy ground. You may also anchor so farre within in the Bay in 15 &amp; 16 fathom, that the north poynt come to be n. w. &amp; n. w. &amp; by n. from you. These are the Summer road, in the Winter you men must anchor further from the land in 28 or 30 fathom, there the ground is course sand. Men may boldly run in before Saffia into the road by night, there is nothing that they need to feare, which may doe them hurt, but the land.</P>
<P>About two leagues from Saffia, lyeth the south point of the bay, which is a low point that lieth out, and two leagues to the southwards of it lieth another steep rocky point without sandy strand. By it goeth in the River Tansit up into the land unto Marrocos.</P>
<P>From the poynt of Saffia to the Island Mogodor, the coast lyeth southsouthwest 19 or 20 leagues.</P>
<P>Against the northeast end of the Island Mogodor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island Mogodor</NOTE> there shooteth off from the maine land, a great row off rocks; being hard sharpe rockes, whereof the outtermost or those that lye next to the Island Mogodor, lye high above water: He that commeth from the northwards, and will sayle in behind the Island Mogodor, must runne in betwixt the Island and the foresayd rockes, close in alongst by the Rocks. It is there in comming in, betwixt the Island and the Rockes five fathom deep. Within the foresayd Rocks lye also some other Rockes on the larboard side, which at high water are under water, and at low water are uncovered. When you come to the end of them, you may luffe up about by them towards the maine land, and anchor there within them in 3 fathom at low water, there is good sand-ground. But yet ne∣verthelesse it is not there very good lying, for by reason of the breaking of the Sea upon the foresayd rocks, there goeth sometimes a great Sea, so that it is not good lying there with a storme, but further in, under the Island it is good lying in two fathom and a halfe. From the south-end of the Island lyeth off a little riffe towards the maine land almost to the foot strand, and to the s. wards off that foresayd little riffe, lyeth a bancke off from the maine land almost a league off into sea. If you will sayle out at the south end, then run alongst by the shoare of the maine land, untill that you bee about the foresayd riffe, and run out then upon your lead along by the banck, &amp; then you shall presently get deeper water, of 4, 6, 8, &amp; 10 fat. then you may sayle there, where you desire to be:</P>
<P>From the point of Saffia to C. de Geer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. de Geer</NOTE> the course is southsouthwest about 43 leagues but from Mogodor the same course is about 22 or 23 leag. It is there betwixt them both a faire flat sand-strand, with double land, which at some places is very high.</P>
<P>About 8 leagues to the northwards of C. de Geer lyeth a point called C. de Taffalana,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. de Taf∣falana.</NOTE> under which men may ride in good sand-ground for east and northeast windes. The C. de Geer is lower then the land to the northwards of it, and falleth to the southwards flat off into sea, which men shall first perceive when they come within 3 or 4 leagues of it. About 4 leagues to the northwards of the Cape lyeth a high Hommocke within the land, &amp; further northwards the land is yet higher; but when you come thus from the northwards near C. de Geer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riffe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</NOTE> you shall see no more land to the southwards of it. When you come to the poynt you must give the riffe a birth that lyeth off from it, and runne about by it, and then forth southeast and by east, and southeast 7 or 8 leagues to S. Cruz,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fore S. Cruz.</NOTE> and then you shall see the Moores Castle stand on the high land: thwart of it lye a row of Rockes, about a Calliver shot in length, else it is all a cleane and cleare coast. For to anchor there in the Bay, runne so farre into the Bay, that the foresayd Moores Castle stand north from you, and the Christians packhouses northeast, there it shall be deepe (to the southwards or the foresayd row of Rocks) 7 and 8 fathom, the north point or C. de Geer, shall then bee from you northwest and by west, there is the best road. In the Summer time you may anchor nearer to the shoare, untill you come in six and seven fathom. When you sayle from C. de Geer towards the playe or the Road, you must be carefull to keepe close aboord of the land of the Cape, and run alongst by it, nutill you come before the Castle. If you runne farre off from the shoare, you shall with northerly windes (which blow there much) be constrained to come in n. e. &amp; n.n. e. again for to recover the shoare, therefore it is best to keep close aboard the high land. He that should come into the road here by night, must not (upon a certain great forfeiture) come nearer the shoare then in 12 or 14 fathom.</P>
<P>In this Road men must be very carefull and ready with their anchors, the smallest bower must be alwaies laid out for the wind which bloweth off the land, and the other anchors to Seawards. The shoot anchor must bee alwaies ready against a storme (which men may very well perceive before by the swelling or rising of the sea) to bring it out in the southwest. Also it is needfull to keepe the foresayle to the yard, for to helpe themselves with it the best that they can if it should happen that they should be forced from their anchors.</P>
<P>In this Bay is much fish to be taken, when men lie there in the road, they take their turnes to go out to fish.</P>
<P>From the C. S. Vincent south-west and by west 140, leagues, &amp; from the Cape de Finisterre southsouthwest and southwest and by south 232 leagues, lyeth the Island Porto Santo lying southeast &amp; northwest upon each end of this Island lyeth a great rock. The road is on the s. w. side, to the eastwardes of the ragged rock, before a little haven where men may lye landlockt with boats.</P>
<P>The Island Madera lyeth from Porto Santo<NOTE PLACE="marg">Porto Santo.</NOTE> s.w. 16 leag. s. wards from the east poynt of Madera,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Madera.</NOTE> lie 3 small rocky Islands, being called the Serters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serters.</NOTE> the northermost is the smallest, and lieth about a league from the land from the foresaid point, the southermost is the greatest, &amp; lyeth 4 leag. from the land. He that commeth from the n. wards, or from Porto Santo, may sayle through betwixt them &amp; the poynt of Madera, it is there betwixt them broad &amp; wide, &amp; also cleane &amp; cleare every where, onely at the foresaid e. point of Madera lyeth a suncken rock, whereof men must take heed.</P>
<P>At the s. side of the Island before the towne S. Cruz<NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Cruz.</NOTE> is a good road in 20 fathom, but before Fonsiall is the chiefest Road for to lade: to the westwards of the Towne lyeth a great rock with a crosse, called the Lion, by it is the best lying in 30 or 40 fathom.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="252"/>
<P>At the southwest west side before Marasilo is also good anchoring in 16 or 18 fathom. In all these foresayd places is good ground for to anchor in.</P>
<P>Betwixt Madera and Teneriffe lyeth the little Island Salvages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salvages.</NOTE> to wit, south from the Serters forty leagues. North from the northeast poynt off Teneriffe seven and twenty leagues, and northnorthwest from the northeast poynt off Great Canaries, forty, or two and forty leag. it lyeth s. w. and northeast and is about a halfe league long. The s. w. end of Salvages is foule farre off into sea, therefore runne rather about to the eastwards of it then to the westwards. Three or 4 leagues s. w. from that poynt, amongst other Rockes, lyeth one great rock which sheweth a far of like a sayle. Under the s. e. side of the Salvages is a good road for a n.w. and west wind.</P>
<P>Madera and the Island S. Michaels<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint Michaels.</NOTE> lye n. w. and s. e. 135 leagues distant. At S. Michaels, the road is at the s. w. side of the Island, when you come about one of the two poynts, either from the east or west, then you shall see two little towns. Before the westermost, called Punte de Gada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punto de Gada.</NOTE> or Punt Alagato, is the Road in 20 and 25 fathom.</P>
<P>Before the eastermost little towne lyeth a little Island, betwixt that and the land of S. Michaels it is 5, 6 and 7 fathom deep. Betwixt these two little townes, the coast lyeth w. n. w. and e. s. e.</P>
<P>From S. Michaels to Tercera,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tercera.</NOTE> the course is n. w. and by w. foure and thirty leagues. Under Tercera the road is on the s. side of the Island, to the westwards of the rockes, right before the towne Angra,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Angra.</NOTE> betwixt two points that lie out, upon each of them standeth a Castle for defence off the shippes which lye there in the Road, the westermost of the 2 poynts lyeth a good wayes further out to seawards then the eastermost, and hath upon the end of it, two very high, called Brasil, when you come out of the sea, either from the eastwards or the westwards, it seemeth a farre off as if it were asunder from the land. These two foresaid hils upon the poynt off Brasill, are so high, that in cleare weather man may see from thence 16 or 17 leagues farr off into sea. Upon it stand 2 pillars, which men may see every where in the towne Angra, and a watchman thereby for to keepe watch, and to give them of the towne warning of the shippes that come about the Island. As many ships as hee seeth come from the westwards or the southwards, that is, from the West-Indies, Brasill, or the Portingals Indies so many Flags he setteth up upon the Pillar towards the west, when he seeth more then five ships, then hee setteth up a great Flagge, which signifieth a whole Fleet. Likewise hee doth the same upon the other Pillar towards the east, for the shippes which he seeth come from the east, from Portingall or from the northwards, so that there cannot a shippe come thereabouts, but men may see it presently by that token in every corner and street of the Towne.</P>

Men may run alongst to the southwards off these Islands, or to the northwards of them, as they will, and also betwixt them both. Betwixt these little Islands and the maine land of Tercera, it is a great cannon shot broad, and 15 and 16 fathom deepe, through betwixt the little Island it is 5 and 6 fathom deepe cleane sand-ground. Somewhat to seawards of these little Islands, lie 3 or 4 rockes above water, called Los Frayles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Fray∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</NOTE> Being past these foresayd little Islands, you must sayle to the westwards, untill that you come neare to the foresaid point of Brasill, a little to the eastwards of it you must anchor before the town of Angra in 10 or 12 fathom, or else men lay their sea-anchor commonly in 16, and their smaller anchor towards the land in 8 or 9 fathom. Men lye there landlockt for a s.w. and n.e. and also for an e.n. e. winde, but a s.e. winde bloweth there flat open in.

<HEAD>The second Demonstration, In Which Are to be seene the Canary Islands.</HEAD>
<P>THe chiefest Islands of the Canaries are 7 in number, Lancerota, Forteventura, or Porte∣ventura, great Canaries, Teneriffe, Gomera, Palma, and Ferro. The Island Lancerota lyeth from Cape S. Vincent southsouthwest distant about 165 leagues. It hath one haven upon the northeast end, betwixt the two Islands Alagranca and Gratiosa, where men may come in from the northwards &amp; lye landlockt for all winds, it is deep there 10, 15, and 20 fathom, and they may sayle out again to the southwards along by Lancerota. At the east side of Lancerota is a good road before the Towne of Lancerota, there lyeth a banck to the northwards of it, which men must avoyd, and run about to the southwards of it, there they may anchor in 10, 11, and 12 fathom: on the same southeast side lye also two bad havens a great shot of a cast peece one from the other, the northermost is called Porto de Naos, &amp; the southermost Porto de Cavallos, which we have demonstrated in a large volume in the northwest corner of this card, &amp; shewed the depths with number of feet at high water &amp; spring-tide.</P>
<P>Porto de Naos, the deepest of these bad-havens, goeth in northwest and by north betwixt two ledges of rockes, there stand two beacons of heapes of stones, in manner as the warders of Norway, which you must bring and keepe one in the other, and sayle so right in through betwixt the two foresayd ledges of rockes. The shoalest of the Barre betwixt the two ledges of rockes, is but a short space, a great shippes length long and is deepe at high watet 17 foot, &amp; at low water seven foot, so soone as you shall be over, it will presently bee 20, 24, 26, &amp; 28 foot deep, then you must edge up n. and then presently northeast &amp; anchor behinde the rockes which lye to the northwards of the Barre, in the Channell the ground is rocky, hard, &amp; uneven. If a ship should come to strike there, it should presently be broken. The ledge is so without as it is within, very steep, soo that you may come very close unto it, where the anchors stand marked, it is altogether cleane sandy ground, 30 &amp; 34 foot deep at high water with a sea wind there can goe here a great sea, but that happeneth seldome, for the winds; doe blow most out of the n. &amp; n.e. and therefore it is almost alwayes there smooth water. This haven is very narrow betwixt the rockes; which lye to seawards of you &amp; the shoare, it is but a little more then a great cables length broad, and from the havens mouth to the main land about a Cables length &amp; a halfe. The Havens mouth also is not broad, but at high water the rockes doe flow a good wayes on both sides under water, which at low water againe are uncovered.</P>
<P>Betwixt Porto de Naos and Porto de Cavallos lye two little Islands, the northermost is the greatest, at high water men may goe through with boats within the Islands, into Porto de Cavallos, but not with ships for at low water it falleth dry there within. Upon the southermost little Island standeth an old Castle fallen downe, which heretofore hath beene spoyled by Englishmen. From the south side of that little Island shooteth off a riffe, &amp; to the southwards or the w. wards of it lyeth in the Barre, which is very narrow, not above ten fathom broad, upon the maine land stand also two little beakons, as at Porto de Naos, which you must bring one in the other, and saile so right in. At high water and spring-tide there is no more then twelve foot water, or an halfe foot more, the ground in the havens mouth is also hard, &amp; nothing else then rocks, where you must goe in over but within it is cleane sandy ground where you may lye a ground without any danger, with a shippe that draweth tenne or eleven foot water. At the highest water the most part of the rockes on both sides of the Havens mouth, lye under water, so that at many places men may goe over them with boats. At low water there remaineth in this Havens mouth no more then a foot, or a foot and a halfe depth, so that a shippes boat cannot goe in; within men lye landlockt for all windes, and although it blow very hard, yet the water is alwayes smooth. In both these havens a south and by west and north and by east moone maketh high water. Neare the Havens there are no houses where Spaniards or Moores doe dwell, then only by Porto de Cavallos a little Church, where they have Masse sayd on Sundayes, when shippes lie there. Men go from thence betwixt the Mountaines to the town, which lieth 3 leag. from thence. He that wil come here must provide himselfe with fresh water, for there is very seldom fresh water to be gotten. Upon this land there groweth neither fruit nor wine. In some good years it giveth out Wheat, Bally, &amp; Orsilly, the Inhabitants are Moore under the command of the King of Spaine.</P>
<P>Betwixt Lancerota and Forteventure lyeth a little lIsand called Isle de Lobos, which is on the outer side, to wit, on the n. west side, very foule. Men may anchor on both sides of that Island in 15 or 20 fathom, also in six fathom a shot of a cast peece southwest and by west from the west point off the Island, there men may lye land-lockt for all windes, except for a northnorthwest and southeast windes. The coast of Forteventura is at the northeast end very foule, with many riffes that lye out, whereupon the sea doth break exceedingly.</P>
<P>The Island of great Canaries lieth from Forteventura west 19 or 20 leagues distant. The road there lyeth, at the east side of the Island, behinde the n.e. point, thwart off a Castle that standeth upon a Chindle. The foresaid northeast point, is a very high point, with a long small and low sandstrand fast to the other land, so that when it is five or sixe leagues northwest or southe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st from you it seemeth to be an Island asunder off from the other land. If you desire to go in there into the road, then saile about by that northeast point, alongst by the Isolettes, leaving them on the starboard side of you untill that the Castle do lie near about northwest and by north from you, anchor there in eight, nine, ten, or twelve fathom, then lieth the north point northeast and by north and the south poynt southsoutheast from you.</P>
<P>At the south end of the great Canaries is a faire sand-bay called Maspalomba, there is a good road for southerly windes, &amp; fresh water to be gotten.</P>
<P>The north point of the great Canaries, and the north∣east point of Teneriffe called Punte de Nago, lie west∣northwest, and eastsoutheast distant 21 leagues. In Teneriffe is a road on the southeast side before the town S. Cruz, there is a faire sand-bay, a little to the north∣wards of the town is the best road in 20, or 24 fathom, and then Punte de Nago, the northeast point of Teneriffe lieth northnortheast from you, and the south point south and by west. When the Pico of Teneriffe is westsouthwest from you, then are you open before this road of S. Cruz, and when you lye in the road of S. Cruz, you may see the Island of great Canaries southeast from you about 13 leagues.</P>
<P>On the northwest side of Teneriffe lieth the road of Garrichica, from the northeast point Punte de Nago westsouthwest and southwest &amp; by west eight or nine leagues; He that will anchor before Garrichica, let him anchor to the westwards of the rock with the crosse called the Lion, so that the foresayd rock do lie south∣east
<PB N="106" REF="256"/> and by east and southeast from him, then he shall lie right before the towne, and may see right into the street of the town, through the Cloister of S. Dominicus, there is clean ground in 36 or 40 fathom, the Pieck lieth then over the w. side off the town, nearer to the land, or to the rock then in 35 or 36 fathom it is not cleane, &amp; westwards towards the riffe Lapania it is also foule ground. This is a dangerous road, therefore every one that commeth here, must be very carefull to have their anchors, cables, and sailes very preedy and ready for to shift roads as soon as it beginneth to be a storme.</P>
<P>There is also a little haven before Garrichica, where men may lie with a few ships. For to sayle in there, you must have a Pilot. On the west side of the havens mouth lieth a rock under water, but the sea breaketh alwayes upon it, you may anchor within in the haven in five or six fathom, and must bring two anchors out a head to seawards, with a cable on the rocks, and an anchor out a stearn, on the land, so that the ships cannot wend too and again, the ground is there foule, you must buye up your cables with buyes and cask for to keep them from the ground. This is a good haven in Summer, then it is com∣monly good weather, but in the winter it is not good to com in there with a ship, for the grown sea out of the n. west commeth running in there sometimes so forcible and strong, that it is not possible to hold a ship, although she had to anchors out. It hath hapned certain years past that there was lost in the same haven a great many ships; and a great many houses of the same towne washed away with the great water.</P>
<P>Betwixt Garrichica and the east end of Teneriffe, are three lading places more for to lade wine at, as Maramela Relecho, and Oratama.</P>
<P>At the southwest end of Teneriffe lieth also another little haven or Bay where is much wines laden called Adessa, there is also good lying except it be with a s.w. winde, which bloweth there open in.</P>
<P>From Teneriffe to the Island la Palma, the course is westnorthwest twenty leagues. On the southeast side la Palma, lieth a faire Bay, with a town and lade-place called S. Cruz. He that commeth from the northwards, and desireth to anchor in the road, let him run so far in the Bay untill he be to the southwards, or past the head, or the bridge, and anchor there in 25 or 30 fathom. In winter time men must not anchor so near the strand, because of the southeast or southsoutheast windes, for then they should lie too near the strand. Men lye there moored with two anchors for the sea winde, with a small anchor out a stearn for to keep the ship right in the road there lyeth to the eastwards of the towne a high white rock with a crosse, there is the best road. A little to the northwards of the town, is a faire sand-bay, there is good anchoring in 20, 30, or 35 fathom, according as men will lye far off, the Road is called the Rammell road. When men lie in the road of Palma, they may see the Pieck of Teneriffe lie eastsoutheast from them. The Island Palma is very high and full of trees, whereby it is easy to bee known.</P>
<P>On the southwest side of la Palma is another place, where men lade wines called Tassa Corda.</P>
<P>About 5 leagues west from the west end of Teneriffe, lieth the Island Gomera, which hath on the n. e. side a good haven of 10 fathom deep, where is good lying almost for all windes, better then in any of the other Islands, but there is nothing to lade: Men may alsoo anchor without before the haven in 20 fathom, but they must shift roads there as at Garrichica.</P>
<P>The road of Adessa in Teneriffe lieth right over against it, east off from it about 5 leagues.</P>
<P>The road of Palma lyeth from this haven in Gomera northwest and by north 16 leagues.</P>
<P>The Island Ferro lieth from the Island Palma south and by west, distant 13 leagues.</P>
