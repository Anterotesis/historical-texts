duely pondred, and rightly used.
This labourious Worke then of mine,</HI> depending on this
<HI>Preamble, is only composed of mine owne Eie-sight,
and occular experience;</HI> (pluris est occulatos test is unus,
quam auriti decem) <HI>being the perfit mirrour, and lively
Portraicture of true understanding, excelling farre all
inventions whatsoever, either Poeticke, or Theorick,</HI>
And now to shunne <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> which I disdain as Hell,
I thought it best to exhibit the profit of my painfull <HI>Tra∣vailes</HI>
to the desirous <HI>World,</HI> for two respects; for as my
dangerous adventures have beene wrought out from the in∣finite
variety of <HI>variable Sights, innumerable toyles,
pleasures, and inevitable sorrowes;</HI> so doth it also best
simpathize with reason, and most fitting that I should ge∣nerally
dispose of the same, to the temperate <HI>iudgements</HI>
of the better <HI>sort,</HI> the <HI>sound</HI> and absolute opinions of the

<HI>Criticks,</HI> who run at randon in the fields of other mens

close grounds; and therefore the different disposition of the
<HI>good</HI> and <HI>bad,</HI> doe best concurre with the interchangeable
occurrences of the matter.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse, for thy more easier understanding, I have
divided this <HI>History into ten Parts, and they also into
three Bookes;</HI> which being seriously perused, doubtlesse
thy Labour shall receive both profit and pleasure. <HI>Accept
them therefore with the same love, that I offer them to
thee, since they cost thee nothing but the Reading, how
deare soever they are to me.</HI> But understand me better,
<HI>I scorne to draw my</HI> Pen <HI>to the ignorant</HI> Foole, <HI>for I

and direction: and to the understanding Gentle∣man,
insight, instruction, and recreation: and to the
true bred <HI>Poet</HI> fraternall love, both in meane and manner.
Now as touching the hissing of snakish Papists, a tush for
that snarling Crew; for as this <HI>Worke,</HI> being fensed with
experience and garnished with trueth, is more then able
to batter downe the stinging venome of their despightfull
Waspishnes: so also they may clearely see therein, as in a Mir∣rour,
their owne blindnes, and the damnable errours of their
blind Guiders, Deceiuers and Idolaters: And aboue all the
cruell infliction imposed vpon me, by the mercilesse Inquisi∣tion
of their profession in <HI>Malaga;</HI> which for Christs
sake I constantly suffered, in Tortures, Torments, and
Hunger.</P>
<P>And lastly, they may perceive Gods miraculous Mercy,
in discovering and delivering me from such a concealed
and inhumane murther.</P>

<P>But by your leave let me enter into consideration of the
intractable passage of my male-contents past, and these im∣portunate
Designes thereupon ensuing: And thus (have I)
in the late dayes of my younger yeeres beene grievously
afflicted? Ah; yea; and with more then disastrous inju∣ries
over-clowded, <HI>O heavy under-prop'd wrongs.</HI> But hath
not the like accident befalne to man before? yea; but ne∣ver
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
the like condition of murther: Nay, but then prepon∣derate
seriously this consequent? may not the scelerate
hands of foure blood-shedding Wolves, facily devoure,
and shake a peeces one silly stragling Lambe? yea, and
most certaine, that unnawares, the harmelesse innocent;
unexpecting evill, may suddenly bee surprized by the am∣bushment
of life-betraying foes. All this I acknowledge;
but whereupon grew this thy voluntary wandring, and un∣constrained
exile? I answere, that being young, and with∣in
minority, in that occurrent time, I was not onely invei∣gled,
but by seducements inforced, even by the greatest
powers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Dialogue betweene the Author and Himselfe▪</NOTE> then living in my Country, to submit my selfe
to arbitrement, satisfaction and reconciliation. But after∣ward
growing in yeares, and understanding better the
nature of such unallowable redresses, and the hainous∣nesse
of the offence; I choosed rather (<HI>voti causa</HI>) to se∣clude
my selfe from my soyle, and exclude my relenting
sorrowes, to be entertained with strangers; than to have
a <HI>quotidian occular</HI> inspection, in any obvious object of
disastrous misfortune: or perhaps any vindicable action,
might from an unsetled ranckour bee conceived. O! a
plaine demonstrate cause, and good resolution; for true it
is, that the flying from evill, is a flying to grace; and a god∣ly
patience is a victorious freedome, and an undaunted
conquerour over all wrongs; <HI>Vengeance is mine</HI> (saith the
Lord) <HI>and I will repay it.</HI> To this I answere; mine eyes have
seene the revenging hand of God upon mine adversaries,
and these night-gaping foes are trampled under foot;
while I from strength to strength, doe safely goe
through the fiery tryall of calamities. My consolation ari∣sing
from the eternall <HI>dictum, quos amo castigo,</HI> whom I
love I correct: And to say my part in my soules experi∣ence,</P>
<Q><PB N="8" REF="12"/>
<L>I never find affliction fall on me</L>
<L>Without desert, for God is true and just:</L>
<L>Nor shal it come, and without profit be,</L>
<L>For God is good, as mercifull I trust.</L>
<L>Then welcome all afflictions sent from God,</L>
<L>He whom he loves he chastneth with his rod.</L></Q>
<P>And as one of the Ancients speaketh well, <HI>Adversa cor∣poris,
animae remedio sunt, aegritudo carnem vulnerat, sed
mentem curat:</HI> The Affliction of the body, is wholesome
Physicke for the soule: it woundeth the flesh, but cureth
the spirit. Certain it is, that the Lord in chastising his owne
doth often move the wicked Reprobates of his wrath, to
bee the instruments of his correcting hand. I could invo∣lume
as large a Discourse upon this heart-grieving pro∣ject,
as upon the late intollerable tortures I sustained by
the treacherous Governour, and bloody Inquisition of
<HI>Malaga</HI> in <HI>Spaine;</HI> being in quality, though not in quanti∣ty
alike. But constantly containing my selfe within the
precinct of patience, referring such eminences to the
Creator, which in a part belongeth not to the Creature;
I may sigh to this World, as sorrowfull <HI>Aeneas</HI> to his
<HI>Dido.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Infandum Regina, jubes renovare dolorem.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou wouldst, I should renew my former griefe</L>
<L>To speake of sorrow, helplesse of reliefe:</L>
<L>He melts in woes, that uttereth griefe with words,</L>
<L>Whilst deepest streames the greatest calme affords.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>But now to proceed in my punctuall purpose, the na∣ture
of man, by an inward inclination, is alwayes inqui∣sitive
of forraigne Newes; yea, and much more affecteth
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
the sight and knowledge of strange, and unfrequented
Kingdomes, such is the instinct of his naturall affection.
Navigation hath often united the bodies of Realmes to∣gether;
but Travaile hath done much more; for first to the
Actor it giveth the impression of understanding, experi∣ence,
patience, and an infinite treasure of unexperimable
vertues: secondly, it unfoldeth to the World the govern∣ment
of States, the authority and disposition of Kings and
Princes; the secrets, manners, customes, and religions of
all Nations and People. And lastly, bringeth satisfacti∣on
to the home-dwelling man, of these things he would
have seene, and could not attempt. Travell hath beene
in more request amongst the Ancients, than it is now with
us in the latter Age. Philosophers, Poets, Historiogra∣phers,
and learned Divines, how they have perigrinated
to know the life of States, and the fashions of farre Coun∣tries,
would be an endlesse taske for me briefely to relate.
Many (I confesse) long to see the remotest Region of the
Earth, but dare not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndertake the dangers of sight, the
chargeable expences of a Tributary journey, the hard
indurance of flint stones for a soft Feather-bed, the extre∣mities
of thirst, nor the parching heate of the Sun, hunger
in the belly, nor the moist distilling dew to bee a humide
Coverlet to their tender skinne, with innummerable other
insuing miseries. But <HI>Ixion</HI>-like, mistaking <HI>Iuno,</HI> would
by a meere imagination, run out the sleeping course of
an endlesse peregrination. For my part, what I have reaped
is by a deer bought knowledge, as it were, a small content∣ment,
in a never contenting subject, a bitter pleasant taste,
of a sweet-seasoned sowre, and all in all, what I found, was
more then ordinary rejoycing, in an extraordinary sorrow
of delights.</P>
<P>But now to leave the contemplation of attempts, to
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
come to the reall adventure: After two voyages I made
to the <HI>Orcadian,</HI> and <HI>Zetlandian</HI> Isles; in the stripling age
of mine adolescency, and there after surveighing all <HI>Ger∣many,
Bohemia, Helvetia,</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries</HI> from
end to end; I visited <HI>Paris,</HI> where I remai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed ten months.
Divers contestations have I had about the equality of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
and <HI>Paris,</HI> in quantity and quality: But having a more
serious subject in hand than this paralell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A comparison betweene <HI>Lon¦don</HI> and <HI>Paris.</HI></NOTE> I conclude thus,
the infinite shipping, and commodious navigation of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
(besides their universall commerse) is more of value,
than the better halfe of <HI>Paris:</HI> compare you the quantity,
for there is the quality of the argument. <HI>Paris</HI> I confesse is
populous, a masse of poore People, for lacques and pages,
a nest of rogues, a tumultuous place, a noctuall denne of
Theeves, and a confused multitude: where contrariwise,
<HI>London</HI> is adorned with many grave, prudent, and provi∣dent
Senators, civill, well-taught, and courteous people,
and absolutely, the best governed City on the whole face
of the earth; as well by night, as by day, and nothing infe∣riour
in quantity to it.</P>
<P>FRom <HI>Paris</HI> (in the the yeare of God 1609. <HI>March</HI> 7) I set
forward, being brought three Leagues on my way, with
a number of my Country gallants, young <HI>Aiton,</HI> young
<HI>Hutonhall,</HI> and specially Monsieur <HI>Hay</HI> of <HI>Smith-field,</HI> now
Esquire of his Majesties body, with divers other Gentle∣men:
where when my kindest thankes had over-clouded
their courtesies, and farewell bid on both sides, I bequea∣thed
my proceedings to God, my body to turmoyling
paines; my hand to the burthen, and my feete to the hard
bruising way. And as unwilling to make relation of my
passing through <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Savoyean,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ligurian Alpes,</HI> sith
it is manifested unto many in this Iland, both by sight and
report, I would shunne, so farre as possible I can, all pro∣lixity
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
of knowne, and therefore unnecessary discourse.</P>
<P>Although I have a large reason, having cross'd the <HI>Alpes</HI>
at sixe severall parts, onely in the one place, I meane to
comment upon <HI>Italy</HI> in generall. Upon the 40. day after
my departure from <HI>Paris,</HI> I arrived at <HI>Rome,</HI> of the which
I will memorize some rarest things, and so proceed. This
City of <HI>Rome</HI> now extant, is not that old <HI>Rome,</HI> which
<HI>Romulus</HI> founded that tempered the morter with the
blood of his brother <HI>Rhemus,</HI> who disdainefully leaped
over the new wals; and was once the mistris of the Uni∣verse
for her Triumphs and Antiquities, but is now onely
the Carkasse of the other, of which she retaineth nothing
but her ruines; and the cause of them, her sinnes.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> which <HI>Romulus</HI> first founded, contained these
two mountaines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Antiquity of <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Capitolino,</HI> and <HI>Palatino,</HI> with the val∣ley
lying betweene both Hills; having three Ports: the
first was called <HI>Trigonio,</HI> because of the triangle it made
neere to the foote of mount <HI>Palatin:</HI> The second <HI>Pan∣donio,</HI>
because it was alwayes open, and for the com∣modity
of the passage, it was called the free Port: The
third was called <HI>Carmentale</HI> of <HI>Carmenta,</HI> the mother of
<HI>Euander</HI> who dwelt there: It was also named <HI>scelorata,</HI>
or wicked gate in regard of 300. <HI>Sabines</HI> put cruelly to
death issuing thereat.</P>
<P>Now after the Monarchy of the <HI>Romanes</HI> had attained
to the full height; the <HI>Gothes,</HI> a base and unknowne peo∣ple,
displaying their banner against this glorious and
imperiall City, in the end razed, and subverted their Pal∣laces,
equalizing the walles with the ground. After the
which detriment, and overthrow, the late subdued <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
recovering their ruinous habitation, were inforced
to withdraw the situation of the Towne, a little more
downe-ward, in <HI>Campus Martius,</HI> close by the bankes
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
of <HI>Tibris;</HI> and transported the stones of these ransacked
buildings to re-edifie their new dwelling places.</P>
<Q><L>Hic ubi nunc Roma est, olim fuit ardua silva,</L>
<L>Tanta{que} res paucis, pascua bobus erat.</L>
<L>Where <HI>Rome</HI> now stands, was sometimes desart woods,</L>
<L>And soyle to feede, some few<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found bestiall goods.</L></Q>
<P>And yet <HI>Rome</HI> was once the famous City of Europe, the
mother and nurse of worthy Senators, the miracle of Na∣tions,
the Epitome of the world, the Kingdome of <HI>Mars,</HI>
and the seven headed soveraigne of many Provinces. The
seven hills whereon she stood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romes</HI> seven Hills.</NOTE> and now partly somewhere
stands: for they are all contained within the vast bounds
of the old walls, which as yet environeth the towne, are
these, <HI>Palatino, Capitolina, Viminale, Aventino, Esquiline,
Coelio,</HI> and <HI>Quiraneno.</HI> Which certainly doe demonstrate
the whoore of <HI>Babylon,</HI> sitting on the Beast with seven
Heads, and cannot be understood but of <HI>Rome,</HI> being buil∣ded
on these seven Hills: having a correspondence to se∣ven
Kings who reigned there; and also acknowledging
seven severall Rulers, <HI>Kings, Consuls, Decemviri, Tribunes,
Dictators, Emperours,</HI> and now <HI>Popes.</HI> During the felicity
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> this City was never taken, but by the
<HI>Gauls,</HI> which being recovered they made a Law that
<HI>Priests</HI> (being otherwise exempted) should goe to Warre, if
ever the <HI>Gauls</HI> came againe; with whom they fought not
for dominion, but for their owne preservation: But since
it became pontificall, it hath beene made a prey to all
Barbarous Nations, and never was besieged by any that
tooke it not.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tyber</HI> which runneth through her bosome,
is not unlike to <HI>Iordan</HI> and <HI>Tagus;</HI> yet not so bigge as ei∣ther
of them, being all three of a troubled and muddy co∣lour:
But it is exceeding outragious, &amp; often menaceth to
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
drowne the whole Mansions, as grieving to grace the
Walls of such a wicked and imperious a place: who having
lost her former preheminent glory, and domination over
the world would not alledge and ascribe a second prero∣gative
over the soules of men, the Heavens, the Hells, the
Silver-coyned Purgatory, the deposing and imposing of
Kings: the former was done by the undaunted courage
of the invincible sword, the latter by presumption, Ava∣rice,
insinuation, and absurd lies.</P>
<P>I remember of a pretty observation of Saint <HI>Katharine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Kathe∣rines</HI> observa∣tion.</NOTE>
of <HI>Siena,</HI> who being stricken in devotion, went to vene∣rate
<HI>Rome,</HI> accompanyed with a goodly traine; and ha∣ving
visited all the Monuments, supposed Holy places, and
Religious relicks there, for the space of five dayes: At last
she came to take view of the Popes Palace, where having
spent a whole day, strictly remarking the gesture and
carriage of the Popes servants: She saw nothi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g but ab∣homination,
prophannation, and irreligious living, and
worser than in <HI>Rome</HI> it selfe: Whereupon suddenly, the
next day she departed for <HI>Siena,</HI> being an hundreth miles
distant; pittifully bewayling her journey, and the mise∣rable
livers she saw in <HI>Rome.</HI> Protesting alwayes after
for sixteene yeares time till her death, that the Wind
never came from the East,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meaning of <HI>Sodomy.</HI></NOTE> blowing Westward to
<HI>Siena,</HI> but shee thought the filthinesse of the Popes Pal∣lace,
and the beastlinesse of <HI>Rome,</HI> ever stunke in her
nose.</P>
<P>This River of <HI>Tyber</HI> especially made muster of his extra∣vagant
disgorgements, at that time when Pope <HI>Clement</HI>
the eighth was Crowned Duke of <HI>Ferrara, auno</HI> 1589. and
that same night hee returned to <HI>Rome, Tyber</HI> waxed so
proud of his arrivall, that impetuously inunding his
bankes to make him welcome, hee overwhelmed the bet∣ter
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
halfe of the Town: And if it had not been for the infi∣nite
charges of the Pope, and desperate toyle of the peo∣ple,
the violent force of his rage swelling courtesie, had
absolutely subverted and carryed away the rest of the Ci∣ty.
The like inundation was never seene of <HI>Tyber,</HI> as af∣ter
this Coronation, portending, that as the first <HI>Go∣morah</HI>
was destroyed by fire, so this second <HI>Sodome</HI> should
be sommerssed by water. The beginning of this River
springeth from the <HI>Ombrian</HI> and <HI>Aquilean</HI> hills, joyning
with the Alpes <HI>Apenine:</HI> whose course is fourescore and
sixteene miles; dis-burthening it selfe in the Sea <HI>Medi∣terrene</HI>
at <HI>Ostia</HI> twelve miles from <HI>Rome.</HI> The mouth and
haven whereof have beene long dammed up, to stoppe
the passage of hostile and Moorish incursions, least the
City should be surprised on a suddaine. By which slavish
Ecclesiasticke feare, <HI>Rome</HI> is shamefully defrauded of
Shipping and forraigne trafficke: and if it were not for the
Clergy, which are the two parts of the Inhabitants (besides
the <HI>Iews,</HI> and Curtezans, which are the greatest imple∣ments
of the other third part) it would become the most
miserable Towne in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>And notwithstanding that for the space of 12 miles
round about <HI>Rome,</HI> there are neither Cornes nor Wines,
nor Village, Plantage, or Cultinage, save onely playne
and pastoragious fields; intermingled at all quarters with
ancient Watch-towers, being an old policy of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
to prevent any sudden surprise of their enemies in∣somuch
that at my first view of <HI>Rome,</HI> I imagined the peo∣ple
were all famished, or in danger of famishing.</P>
<P>But by your leave, being once entred the City, I found
abundance of all things necessary for life, at so easie and
gentle a rate, that never a Town in <HI>Europe</HI> hitherto could
shew mee the like. The common Wine that is drunke in
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
<HI>Rome</HI> is <HI>Vin Romanisco,</HI> the better sort <HI>Albano, Muscatello,
Sheranino,</HI> but as for <HI>Lachrimae Christi,</HI> the teares of
Christ, I drew so hard at that same weeping Wine, till I
found my purse begun to weepe also; and if time had not
prevented the sweetnesse of such teares, I had been left for
all the last miserable mourner. As for the place where the
Pilgrimes finde one Dinner, called the <HI>Popes</HI> Table,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pilgrim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dinner at the <HI>Popes</HI> table.</NOTE> it is
thus: there is a certaine low roome at Saint <HI>Peters</HI> palace,
and without the gate, where every day at our nine of the
clocke, there meet 21 pilgrimes; 14 from the Trinitie, one
having a bullet for all, and seven from Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Peni∣tentialls:
where being received, the seven Jesuite Pil∣grims
get the upper place, and sit alone, yet all of them
alike served, each of them having four dishes of meat, be∣sides
bread and abundance of wine. The dinner done, their
fragments are wrapt up in cleane paper, which they carry
with them, and so departing, they, or like company come
no more there. They are daily served with a very venera∣ble
Prelate, and a few other serviceable Priests, but for
the <HI>Popes</HI> presence with them, there is no such matter.
That liberty being spoyld by a drunken <HI>Dutch-man</HI> about
60 yeares agoe, who in presence of the <HI>Pope</HI> gave up a∣gaine
his good Cheare and strong Wines, with a freer
good will then they were allowed him, whereat
the <HI>Pope</HI> grew angry, notwithstanding the drunken
fellow cryed through his belching throate, Thankes
Holy Father, Deere Holy Father, God blesse your
Holinesse.</P>
<P>Many have wrote of the singularities of old <HI>Rome,</HI> and
I will also recite some decayed Monuments thereof,
which I have seene: The speciall object of Antiquity I
saw, being never a whit decayed to this day, is the <HI>Tem∣plum
omnium De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> but now, <HI>omnium sanctorum,</HI> buil∣ded
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
in a <HI>rotund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and open at the top with a large round,
like to the Quire of the Holy Grave. And a pretty way
from this, are the remainants of that Ancient Amphithe∣ater
beautified with great Columnes, of a wonderfull
bignesse and height, and a Mile in compasse; the reason
why it was first devised, the Ghosts of the slaughtered
<HI>Sabines</HI> may testifie.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romes</HI> Anti∣quities.</NOTE> To be briefe, I saw the decayed
house of worthy <HI>Cicero,</HI> the high Capitoll, the Pallace
of cruell <HI>Nero,</HI> the Statues of <HI>Marcus Aurelius, Alexan∣der,</HI>
and his horse <HI>Bucephalus.</HI> The greene hill, like unto
Mount <HI>Cavallo,</HI> that was made of the Potters sheards at
one time, which brought the Tribute gold to this Impe∣riall
Seat: the seven Piramides, some whereof, during her
former glory, were transported from <HI>Aegypt:</HI> The high
and small Statues of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> the Castle St. <HI>Angel.</HI>
which <HI>Adrian</HI> first founded, standing now in a mode∣rate
circumferent height, with incircling battlements, and
their doubtfull transported Reliques from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
with many other things I diligently remarked, some
whereof were frivilous, some ambiguous, and some fa∣mous.</P>
<P>Neare to Mount <HI>Palatin,</HI> and the decayed Temple of
<HI>Romulus,</HI> I saw the Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> converted now to
the Church of <HI>Sancta Maria, Liberatrice Dalla piene di
Inferno,</HI> The deliverer from Infernall paines, as <HI>Venus</HI> was
the <HI>Censolatrix</HI> of amorous paines.</P>
<P>Besides all these I saw one most sight-worthy Spectacle,
which was the Library of the Ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> being
licentiated to enter with two Gentlemen, Sir <HI>William
Carre,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Iames Aughmuty,</HI> my Country-men, where
when I was come, I beheld a world of old bookes, the
first whereof, was an infinite number of Greeke Bibles,
subscribed with the hands of these Holy Fathers, who (as
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
they say) translated them out of the Hebrew tongue.</P>
<P>I saw also the Academies of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> wherein hee
treateth of the soule, health, life, nature and qualities of
men, with the Medicaments of <HI>Galen,</HI> for the diseases and
infirmities of man: The familiar Epistles of <HI>Cicero,</HI> the
<HI>Aencidot</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> the <HI>Saphicke</HI> Verses of that <HI>Lesbian
Sapho,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Famous Au∣thors.</NOTE> the workes of <HI>Ovid, Pliny, Plutarke, Titus Livius,

St. <HI>Austine,</HI> St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> St. <HI>Gregory,</HI> &amp;
likewise the workes of other excellent Philosophers, Di∣vines
and Poets: all wrote with their owne hands, and sea∣led
with their names, and manuell subscriptions. I saw also
the forme of the first ancient writing which was upon
leaves of Trees, cakes of lead, with their fingers on ashes,
barkes of Trees, with strange figures, and unknowne Let∣ters,
that was brought from <HI>Aegypt:</HI> for the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> first
devised the use thereof, and the sight of infinite Obligato∣ry
writings of Emperours, Kings, and Princes, which I
omit to relate, referring the same to be Registred by the
next beholder.</P>
<Q><L>Still left untold, something there must be seene,</L>
<L>For them, who trace our feete, with <HI>Argos</HI> eyne:</L>
<L>Yet let them stay, and take this verball note,</L>
<L>They who would better write, must larger quote.</L></Q>
<P>Bidding adiew to my company, and this Library, I lon∣ged
to view the gorgeous Mosaicall worke of St. <HI>Peters</HI>
Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h: The matter was no sooner conceived, but I went
to the doore, yet affraid to enter, because I was not accu∣stomed
with the carriage, and ceremonies of such a <HI>San∣ctum
Sanctorum:</HI> but at the last, abandoning all scrupulo∣sities,
I came in boldly, and on my right hand, as I entred
within the doore, I espyed the portrayed Image of S. <HI>Peter</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
erected of pure Brasse, and sitting on a brazen Chaire. The
fashion of the people is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The brazen I∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of Saint <HI>Peter.</HI></NOTE> entring the Church, they goe
straight to this Idoll, and saluting with many crosses his
sencelesse body, kisse his feete, and every one of his severall
toes: insomuch that those his comfortlesse feete are
growne fiery red, while his body, save his breasts, remai∣neth
brazen blew: and yet for sooth some of their learned
<HI>Rabincs</HI> will not have this superstition, but an hum∣ble
commemoration of their adored Saints, or the like,
for procuring favour of intercession, whilst the ere∣cted
Idoll (<HI>interum</HI>) receiveth all their superfluous abho∣minations
of diurnall worship. Next, they lay their
heads under the sole of his right foote, and arising, rub
their Beades on his hard costed belly: thus adoring that
breathlesse masse of mettall; more then though it were a
living creature.</P>
<P>O wonderfull and strange spectacle? that these onely
titular Christians, should become worse of knowledge
then Ethnicke Pagans, to worship and reverence the
workemanship of mens hands. Woe and shame bee unto
you all blinde Hereticall Papists; Why should you make to
your selves Idols and Images of gold, silver, brasse, Iron,
stone, earth and tree? And notwithstanding would excuse
the matter with a superstitious reason, alledging, you doe
it onely in remembrance, where otherwise it is a damnable
signe of wilfull obdurate ignorance: May not the prohibi∣tion
of the 2. Commandement of Gods Law, which abso∣lutely
you abrogate, dividing the last Commandement in
two; confound the errour of this Idolatry, ingrafted in
your hardned hearts.</P>
<P>What vertue can be in a lumpe of brasse? or what
comfort in the devices of handy-crafts-men; Alas, no∣thing
but eternall sorrow &amp; condem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion. This was one
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
of the lamentable errors I saw in the <HI>Roman</HI> Sea, amongst
many other thousands: When the foolish <HI>Listranes</HI> or <HI>Li∣caonians</HI>
would have sacrificed Buls to the honor of <HI>Paul</HI>
and <HI>Barnabas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Superstition of Papists.</NOTE> they rent their Cloaths, and ran in among
the people, crying, and saying; <HI>O men, why doe you these
things? we are even men subject to the like passions that you be:</HI>
How is it then, That the Apostles being alive, would
have no acknowledging by any homage of man; yet
when they are dead, the <HI>Romanists</HI> will worship their
counterfeit similitude, in stone or tree. What unworthy
fained Traditions and Superstitious Idolatry? What
strange new devising trickes they use, to plant idle mona∣steriall
Loyterers? How many manner of wayes these bel∣ly-minded
slaves Epicure-like leade their lives? And what
a Sea of abhominable villany they swimme into, practi∣sing
even unnaturall vices, I meane of their wrongfully cal∣led
Religious Bishops, Priests, Friers, Curates, and all the

<P>But for feare of Excommunication from that Antichristi∣an
Curtezan, I dare not persevere longer herein: al∣though
I can; yea, and so truely bewray their all-corrup∣ted
estate, that I need no information of any <HI>Romane</HI> No∣vice
Traveller. Of whose sight and experience, would
God all the Papists in <HI>Brittaine</HI> had the like eye-witnessing
approbation as I have had, I am certainly perswaded, with
tears &amp; sighes, they would heavily bemoane the terrible fall
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
of that <HI>Babylonish</HI> whoore, which in prophane estima∣tion)
is their holy mother Church. For I sincerely
sweare to thee, O faithfull Christian (as the <HI>Italian</HI> usu∣ally
doth in his humours) by the golden tripled Crowne
of my ghostly Father, <HI>Paulo Papa quinto,</HI> whatsoever
sacriledge, incest or villany a Paplst committeth; let him
come here, and fill the bribing hands of the <HI>Limonaicall

<P>And he shall have Indulgences, Dispensations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pardons for pennies.</NOTE> adjoy∣ned
Penances, or absolved Offences, for hundreds, thou∣sands,
lesse, or more yeares. The period of Time, after
eight and twenty dayes abode, wishing my departure, I
hardly escaped from the hunting of these blood-sucking
Inquisitors, of which the most part were mine owne
Country-men, the chiefest of whom, was <HI>Robert Mo∣phet,</HI>
a Iesuit borne in St. <HI>Andrewes, David Chambers,</HI> and
of our Colledge there, one <HI>Gordon,</HI> and one <HI>Cuningham,</HI>
borne in the <HI>Cannon-gate</HI> of <HI>Edenborough:</HI> And to speake
truth, if it had not beene for <HI>Robert Meggat,</HI> borne neere
to <HI>Newbattle,</HI> then resident in <HI>Burgo di Roma</HI> with the old
Earle of <HI>Tyrone,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">My escape from <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> who hid mee secretly for three dayes in

at the fourth mid-night, and leapt the walles of
<HI>Rome</HI> with mee, I had doubtlesse dyed as hot a death as a
Lady Prioresse of <HI>Naples</HI> did afterward in my second
Travells: And for better record <HI>Patricke</HI> Baxster, now
dwelling in <HI>Dundy,</HI> and then followed the Earle of <HI>Ty∣ron</HI>
can justifie the same, my custody and mine escape be∣ing
both within his knowledge. Yet I may justly affirme)
it in these parts a man can finde no worser enemie then his
Nationall supposed friend, Religion being the cause of it,
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
and at home none more false nor deceitfull than a bosome
friend.</P>
<Q><L>Mens mindes, their praises, best loves, and kind conceits,</L>
<L>They hurling come and goe, like fish at baits.</L></Q>
<P>And the <HI>Italian</HI> saith in his Proverbe; <HI>God keepe mee
from the hurt of my friends, for I know well how to keepe me
from mine enemies.</HI> From thence bound East-ward, I vi∣sited
<HI>Naples,</HI> the commendations of which, I revolve in
this verse;
<Q><L>Inclyta Parthenope gignit Comites{que} Duces{que}</L>
<L>Most noble <HI>Naples,</HI> breeds but Dukes and Earles,</L>
<L>And gallant Knights, and Ladies load with Pearles.</L></Q></P>
<P>Amongst many other things neare to this City, which in
the conclusion of this Historicall discourse be more parti∣cularly
expressed (were <HI>Lacus Avernus, Sibillaes</HI> Cave,
<HI>Puteoli,</HI> the <HI>Sulphurean</HI> mountaine <HI>Capua</HI> and <HI>Cuma,</HI> where
banished <HI>Aeneas,</HI> from <HI>Troy</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> arrived) I saw
the Monument of <HI>Virgills</HI> buriall standing in the fore face
of his owne <HI>Grotto,</HI> that is cut through the mountaine of

<P><HI>Italy</HI> was called so of <HI>Italus,</HI> a King in <HI>Sicily,</HI> which

by <HI>Ianus, Anno Mundi</HI> 1925. From whom sprung the
tribes of the <HI>Samnites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first plantation of <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Sabines, Laurentani,</HI> and <HI>Taren∣tines:</HI>
The second Plantation was by <HI>Evander,</HI> and cer∣taine

delicious lives of the effeminate <HI>Affricans</HI> arrived here, &amp;
were kindly entertained by King <HI>Latinus,</HI> whose daugh∣ter

the <HI>Italians</HI> bragge of their discent; and so likewise boast
divers other nations to have discended from that <HI>Dardan</HI>
stocke, as glorying in such a famous pedigree. The length
of <HI>Italy</HI> is nine hundred <HI>Italian</HI> miles, though some allot
a thousand, it is false, for I have trod foure severall times

<P>So in a false description, some blind Geographers,

<P>The breadth of <HI>Italy</HI> at the roote and beginning thereof,

<P>In the meane while, having alwayes a regard of my ha∣sty

notable illusions of <HI>Modonna di Loretta,</HI> which I found
in my way-faring journey, to amplifie my former dis∣course,
concerning the errours of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and
as yet was never Englished in our language.</P>
<P>Before I came neare to <HI>Loretta</HI> by tenne miles, I over∣tooke
a Caroch, wherein were two Gentlemen of
<HI>Rome,</HI> and their two Concubines; who when they espi∣ed
mee, saluted me kindly, enquiring of what Nation I
was? whither I was bound? and what pleasure I had to
travell alone? After I had to these demands given satis∣faction,

At last they perceiving my absolute refusall, present∣ly
dismounted on the ground, to recreate themselves in
my company: and incontinently, the two young unmar∣ried
Dames came forth also, and would by no perswa∣sion
of me, nor their familiars mount againe; saying, they
were all Pilgrimes, and bound to <HI>Loretta</HI> (for devotion
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke) in pilgrimage, and for the pennance enjoyned
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o them by their Father Confessour. Truely so farre as I
could judge, their pennance was small, being carried with
Horses, and the appearance of their devotion much lesse:
for lodging at <HI>Riginati,</HI> after supper, each youth led cap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive
his dearest Darling to an unsanctified bed, and left me
to my accustomed repose.</P>
<P>When the morning Starre appeared, wee imbraced
the way marching towards <HI>Loretta,</HI> and these virmillion
Nymphs, to let mee understand they travelled with a
cheerefull stomacke, would oft runne races, skipping like

wanton Lambes on grassie Mountaines, and quenching
their follies in a Sea of unquenchable fantasies. Approa∣ching
neare the gate of the Village, they pulled off their
shooes and stockings, walking bare-footed through the
streetes, to this tenne thousand times polluted Chappell▪
mumbling <HI>Pater nosters,</HI> and <HI>Ave mariaes</HI> on their beads.
When they entred the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt de∣votion.</NOTE> wherein the Chappell
standeth, I stood at the entry beholding many hundreds

<P>Now I remember heere of a prettyjest, for hee and I
going in to see the inravile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Image with sparrets of Iron,
and musing on the blacknesse of her face, and the rich∣nesse
of her gowne, all set with precious Stones and Dia∣monds;
and because she is sightlesse, foure Lampes of oyle
they keepe alwayes burning before her face, that the peo∣ple
may see her, because she cannot see them. There was,
I say a young lusty woman hard by my elbow, busie
at her Beades, who with the heate of the throng, and for
lacke of ayre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fleshly false spr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng miracle</NOTE> fell straight in a sound: the women about
her gave a shoute, and cryed that our blessed Lady had ap∣peared
to her; whereupon she was carried forth and laid
upon the steppes, that discend from the Chappell to the
Church-floore, five hundred more came to visite her
with salutations of Saint, Saint, O ever blessed Saint. Now
it was Friday in the fore-noone, and the woman having
travelled all night, and to save charges of fish, had eaten a
cold bit of her owne meat privately in the Taverne, with
halfe a <HI>Buckale</HI> of red Wine: The people more admiring
this imaginary heavenly trance, than the reliefe of the
woman; at last said I, brother <HI>Arthur,</HI> I will goe open
yonder womans breast, and I did so: and holding up her
head before all the people, there sprung a flood of <HI>vin∣garbo</HI>
downe the Alablaster stayres, intermingled with
lumpes of ill-chew'd flesh: Whereat the people being
amazed, from a Saint swore she was a Divell: And if my
friend and I, had not made hast to carry the sicke woman
from the Church to a Taverne, doubtlesse they had sto∣ned
her to death; and here was one of their miracles.</P>
<P>Another time, comming backe from my second Tra∣vels
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
in <HI>Affricke,</HI> it was my lucke to stumble in heere a∣gaine,
where I saw an old <HI>Capouschin</HI> Frier conjuring the
Divell out of a possessed woman, who had stayed there,
and two men keeping her above eighteene moneths, being
twice a day brought before the Chappell. The Frier
stood up before her, the two men holding both her armes;
and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Capouchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Frier conju∣ring the Div<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</NOTE> laying his formost finger on her brow; <HI>In nomine

thee to shew mee for what cause thou hast possessed the soule of
this poore wretch, and I adjure thee to goe backe unto those
places from whence thou camest.</HI> Meane while the woman
stood dumbe and silent for the space of a quarter of an
houre, not being usuall before: the people gave a shoute,
and cry'd the Divell had left her, whereat hee that held
her right arme did let it fall downe by her side: but by
your leave, in the twinckling of an eye, the Divell in the
woman gave the Frier such a rattle in the face, that he was
stroke downe upon his backe among the people: and if
it had not bin that shee was borne downe with strength of
hands, she had torne the silly old Conjurer in peeces: cry∣ing,
<HI>O false and dissembling knave, pretendest thou to have
power to cast out evill Spirits when thou thy selfe is in a

your reward.</HI></P>
<P>This is another of our Lady of <HI>Lorettaes</HI> Miracles,
though many moe I could recite: as for any more vertue
of this Cymberian Image, I have knowne sicke folkes

here before this Lady, till I returned againe from <HI>Asia</HI> and

weeping for health; But alas poore soules, they lost their
labour. When they had both spent all their meanes, and
perhaps the poorest of them three dayes attendance, and
forced to my knowledge to returne againe to their seve∣rall

<P>O strange and wonderfull frailty of men! what damna∣ble
imperfections domineere over our brain-sicke know∣ledge?
Sathan, thou Prince of darkenesse, hast so over∣seiled
the dimmed eyes of their wretched soules, that not∣withstanding
of Gods eternall Word, ordained to call
them (through the spotlesse blood of <HI>Christ Iesus</HI>) to be
the heires and adopted Sonnes of Salvation: yet thou
all abhominable enemy of mankind, overthrowest both
their spirituall and naturall understanding in a bottome∣lesse
Ocean of darke ignorance; promising to thy obdu∣rate
souldiers, to build Castles in the Ayre; and contrary∣wise
is busie, digging downe dungeons, to welcome thy
hellish eternized guests, with horrible torments, and ne∣ver
ceasing flames of everlasting fire. What wilfull-hear∣ted
man can bee so apt to beleeve, that our blessed Lady
had such estimation of morter and stones, as to have (al∣though
shee had, had power) caused Angels to transport a
rotten house so often? No, I say, beleeve it who so will;
questionlesse, the Iudgements of God in the truth of his
all-seeing Iustice, shall reward their too credulous minds
accordingly: then shall they know their foolish and su∣perstitious
errours.</P>
<P>But now to leave them with their Idolatry to stones,
mettall, and Images, I come to their blasphemies against
the sacred Deity: Looke to the workes of <HI>Bernardini de

they derogate the glory from God, and attribute all
grace, mercy and omnipotency, to the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> So
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
<HI>Ludolphus</HI> and <HI>Chrysostome</HI> affirme, that <HI>Velocior est non

saved by calling on the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> than on Christ.
<HI>Omnia quae Dei sunt, Mariae sunt, quia mater &amp; sponsa Dei

because she is both the Spouse, and the mother of God,
saith a <HI>Rabbin</HI> of theirs: and as many creatures honour the

shee is neither superiour in power, uni∣versall

one offering would suffice for all. They chatter

they say God divided the Kingdome with the Virgin, re∣serving
to himselfe Justice, granted to his mother mercy,
whereby if any man be aggrieved with Gods Justice, hee
may appeale to the Court of her mercy.</P>

this, hee also entertained me three dayes, with a most
bountifull, and kind acceptance: My solitary travelling he
oft bewailed, wishing me to desist, and never attempt such
a voyage; but I giving him absolute and constant answers,
appeased his imagined sorrow.</P>
<P>True it is, that ignorance and sloth, make every thing
terrible unto us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance and Sloth.</NOTE> and we will not, because we dare not; and
dare not, because we will not: This makes us submit our
selves to any thing, that doth either flatter or threaten us:
and some like sottish weakelings, that give the reines of
their government into the hands of their Wives or Ser∣vants,
thinking then they buy their peace when they sell
it; thus doe they grow upon us, I meane ignorance and
sloth, and by composition, not force, become masters of
the place, being just so strong, as we are weake. And as
contrary newes delivered at one time, maketh one to
heare with joy, and remember with sorrow; even so an un∣resolved
man, in high and heroicke designes, though see∣ming
forward is distracted heere, set one feare there, and
rent asunder every where with the flashing frights of des∣peration:
But a constant resolution can couragiously
support all things; <HI>Vbicunque homo est, ibi beneficio locu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

farewell to his counsell.</P>
<P><HI>Zara</HI> is the Cappitoll City of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> called of old
<HI>Iadara.</HI> The inhabitants, are governed by a <HI>Camarlingo,</HI>
or Chamberlaine, in the behalfe of <HI>Venice.</HI> The walles
whereof are strongly rampired with earth; surpassing the
tops of the stone-worke: and fortified also with high
Bulwarkes, and planted Canons on elevated Rampires of
earth: which are above forty Cubits higher than the
Walles and Bulwarkes; standing in the foure severall
corners of the City.</P>
<P><PB REF="32"/>
There lye continually in it, a great Garrison of Soul∣diers
to defend the Towne and Citizens, who are main∣tained
by the Duke of <HI>Venice;</HI> for hee is Signior thereof.
They have indured many invasions of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> especi∣ally
in the yeare one thousand five hundred and seventy,
when for the space of foureteene moneths, they were dai∣ly
molested and besieged, but the victory fell ever to the
Christians: if the <HI>Turkes</HI> could win this place, they
might easily command the <HI>Adreaticall</HI> Seas, in regard of
that faire Haven which is there, to receive Ships and Gal∣lies;
which maketh the <HI>Venetians</HI> not a little fearefull be∣cause
of their safeguard.</P>
<P>Yet they licentiate the neighbouring <HI>Infidels</HI> to Trafficke

their weapons to the Corporall of the Squadron

<P>When the wandring night was chased from the inferi∣our

that divideth <HI>Dalmatia</HI> from <HI>Slavonia;</HI> many fondly
conceive that these two Kingdomes are all one, but I
hold the contrary opinion, both by experience, and by
ancient Authors: having passed <HI>Capo di Costa,</HI> which is
the beginning of <HI>Slavonia,</HI> I saw upon my right hand, a
round Rocke of a great height, in forme of a Piramide;
being cognominated by Easterne Mariners, <HI>Pomo,</HI> anci∣ently
<HI>Salyro,</HI> for the good Faulcons that are bred therein.
It standeth in the middest of the Gulfe betweene <HI>Slavonia</HI>
and <HI>Italy,</HI> and not habitable.</P>
<P>A little beyond that Rocke, I saw the three Iles <HI>Tre∣miti:</HI>
the chiefest whereof is called <HI>Teucria,</HI> but they are
vulgarly called the Iles of <HI>Diomedes,</HI> who was King of

remaining in the Campe more busie about the spoyles
then their owne safety; the <HI>Turkes</HI> returned againe before
day, the <HI>Christians</HI> being disordered with booties and
the ravening of their whores, they put them all to the edge
of the sword: O miserable confusion! Little better might
I speake of the battell of <HI>Lepanto</HI> being abus'd even in the
using of it, and that glorious victory no ways followed, as
good fortune had given them an awfull opportunity: for
<HI>Don Iohn</HI> of <HI>Austria</HI> their Generall had a greater mind to
feaze upon the Ile of <HI>Corfu,</HI> and to robbe <HI>Venice</HI> of her
liberty, then to prosecute with vengeance the brave be∣ginning
of so notable a victory; and yet his treachery was
discover'd, and by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Generall speedily disap∣pointed,
to his eternall shame both wayes.</P>
<P>The poore <HI>Slavonians</HI> being fatigated in their hunger-starving
Boate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith extraordinary paines (for wee had
three dayes calme, which is not usually seene in these Seas)
were enforced to repose all night at the barren Ile of St.
<HI>Andrew:</HI> This Ile is of circuit foure miles, but not in∣habited:
the excessive raine that fell in the evening, made
us goe on shoare, to seeke the coverture of some rocke;
which found, wee lay all night on hard stones, and with
hungry bellies, for our provision was spent. The breach
of day giving comfort to our distressed bodies, with fa∣vourable
windes at the <HI>Garbo e ponente,</HI> we set forward,
and about mid-day wee arrived in the port of <HI>Lesina,</HI> of
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>
which the Ile taketh the name.</P>
<P>This Ile of <HI>Lesina</HI> is of circuite, a hundred and fifty
miles, and is the biggest Iland in the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea: It
is exceeding fertile, and yeeldeth all things plentifully, that
is requisite for the sustenance of man. The City is un∣walled,
and of no great quantity, but they have a strong
fortresse, which defendeth the Towne, the Haven, and
the vessels in the Roade. The Governour, who was a <HI>Ve∣netian,</HI>
after hee had enquired of my intended voyage,
most courteously invited me three times to his Table, in
the time of my five dayes staying there: and at the last
meeting, hee reported the story of a marvellous mis-sha∣pen
creature borne in the Iland, asking if I would goe
thither to see it: wherewith (when I perfectly understood
the matter) I was contented: the Gentleman honoured
me also with his company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Monster borne in <HI>Le∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪</HI></NOTE> and a horse to ride on, where
when we came, the Captaine called for the Father of that
Monster, to bring him forth before us. Which unnaturall
Child being brought, I was amazed in that sight, to
behold the deformity of Nature; for below the middle
part there was but one body, and above the middle
there was two living soules, each one separated from
another with severall members. Their heads were both
of one bignesse but different in Phisnomy: the belly of
the one joyned with the posterior part of the other, and
their faces looked both one way, as if the one had carried
the other on his backe, and often before our eyes, hee
that was behind, would lay his hands about the necke of
the foremost. Their eyes were exceeding bigge, and their
hands greater than an infant of three times their age. The
excrements of both Creatures issued forth at one place,
and their thighes and legges of a great grouth, not sem∣blable
to their age, being but sixe and thirty dayes old;
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>
and their feet were proportionably made like to the foote
of a Cammell, round and cloven in the middest. They
received their food with an insatiable desire, and continu∣ally
mourned with a pittifull noise; that sorrowfull man
told us, that when one slept the other awaked, which
was a strange disagreement in Nature, The Mother of
them bought dearely that birth, with the losse of her
owne life; as her Husband reported, unspeakable was
that torment she endured, in that woefull wrestling paine.
I was also informed afterwards, that this one, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther
twofold wretch, lived but a short while after we saw them.</P>
<P>Leaving this monstrous shapen Monster to the owne
strange, and almost incredible Nativity, we returned to
<HI>Lesina.</HI> But by the way of our back-comming, I remem∣ber
that worthy Gentleman, who shewed me the ruines of
an old house, where the noble King <HI>Demetrius</HI> was borne;
and after I had yielded my bounden and dutifull thankes
unto his generous minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demetri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</NOTE> I hired a Fisher-boat to goe o∣ver

<P>On our left hand toward the Maine, wee saw an Iland
called Saint <HI>Maure,</HI> formerly <HI>Leucas,</HI> or <HI>Leucada;</HI> which
is onely inhabited by <HI>Iewes,</HI> to whom <HI>Bajazet</HI> the second
gave it in possession, after their expulsion from <HI>Spaine:</HI>
The chiefe City is Saint <HI>Maure,</HI> which not long agoe
was subject to <HI>Venice.</HI> This Ile Saint <HI>Maure</HI> was anciently
conriguate with the continent, but now rent asunder,
and invironed with the Sea: In the meane while of
our navigable passage, the Captaine of the Vessell espyed
a Saile comming from sea, hee presently being moved
therewith, sent a Mariner to the toppe, who certified him
she was a <HI>Turkish</HI> Galley of <HI>Biserta,</HI> prosecuting a straight
course to invade our Barke. Which suddaine affrighting
newes overwhelmed us almost in despaire. Resolution
being by the amazed Master demanded, of every man
what was best to doe, some replyed one way, and some
another: Insomuch, that the most part of the passengers
gave Counsell rather to render than fight; being confi∣dent
their friends would pay their ransome, and so relieve
them. But I the wandring Pilgrime, pondering in my pen∣sive
breast, my solitary estate, the distance of my Country
and friends, could conceive no hope of deliverance. Up∣on
the which troublesome and fearefull appearance of
slavery, I absolutely arose, and spoke to the Master,
saying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A counsaile to fight.</NOTE> <HI>The halfe of the Carmosalo is your owne, and the
most part also of the loading:</HI> (all which he had told me be∣fore)
<HI>wherefore my Counsaile is, that you prepare your selfe
to fight; and goe encourage your Passengers, promise to your
Mariners double wages, make ready your two pieces of
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>
Ordnance, your Muskets, Powder, Lead, and halfe-pikes:
for who knoweth, but the Lord may deliver us from the thral∣dome
of these Infidels:</HI> My exhortation ended, hee was
greatly animated therewith, and gave me thankes; wher∣upon
assembling the passengers &amp; Mariners, he gave good
comfort and large promises to them all: so that their af∣frighted
hopes was converted to a couragious resolution;
seeming rather to give the first assault, than to receive the
second wrong.</P>
<P>To performe the plots of our defence, every man was bu∣sie
in the worke, some below in the gunner-roome, others
cleansing the Musket, some preparing the powder &amp; balls,
some their swords and short weapons, some dressing the
halfe-pikes, and others making fast the doores above: for
so the Master resolved to make combate below, both to
save us from small shot, and besides for boarding us on a
suddaine. The dexterous courage of all men was so for∣ward
to defend their lives and libertie, that truely in mine
opinion we seemed thrice as many as were. All things be∣low
and above being cunningly perfected, and every one
ranked in order with his Harquebuse and pike to stand on
the Centinell of his owne defence, wee recommend our
selves in the hands of the Almighty; and in the mean while
attended their fiery salutations.</P>
<P>In a furious spleene, the first <HI>Hola</HI> of their courtesies,
was the progresse of a Martiall conflict, thundring forth a
terrible noyse of Gally-roaring peeces. And wee in a sad
reply, sent out a back-sounding Eccho of fiery flying shots:
which made an Equinox to the Clouds, rebounding back∣ward
in our perturbed breasts, the ambiguous sounds
of feare and hope. After a long and doubtfull fight,
both with great and small, shot, (night parting us) the
<HI>Turkes</HI> retired till morning, and then were mindfull to
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>
give us the new rancounter of a sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd alarum. But as it
pleased him, who never faileth his, to send downe an un∣resistable
tempest, about the breake of day wee escaped
their furious designes; and were enforced to seeke into
the Bay of <HI>Largastolo</HI> in <HI>Cephalonia,</HI> both because of the
violent weather, and also for that a great leak was stricken
into our ship. In this fight there were of us killed three
<HI>Italians,</HI> two <HI>Greekes,</HI> and two <HI>Iewes,</HI> with eleven others
deadly wounded, and I also hurt in the right arme with a
small shot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A notable de∣liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance.</NOTE> But what harme was done by us amongst the
Infidels, we are not assured thereof, save onely this, wee
shot away their middle Mast, and the hinder part of the
poupe; for the <HI>Greeks</HI> are not expert Gunners, neither
could our Harquebusadoes much annoy them, in respect
they never boarded. But howsoever it was, being all dis∣barked
on shore, we gave thanks to the Lord for our un∣expected
safety, and buried the dead Christians in a <HI>Gree∣kish</HI>
Church-yard, and the <HI>Iewes</HI> were interred by the sea
side.</P>
<P>This Bay of <HI>Largastolo</HI> is two miles in length, being in∣vironed
with two little Mountaines: upon the one of these
two, standeth a strong Fortresse, which defendeth the
passage of the narrow Gulfe. It was here that the Chri∣stian
Gallies assembled, in the yeare 1571. when they
came to abate the rage of the great <HI>Turks</HI> Armado; which
at that time lay in <HI>Peterasso,</HI> in the firme land of <HI>Greece,</HI> and

pleasant fields, especially the Vale <HI>Alessandro;</HI> where the

Battell by the <HI>Macedoniah</HI> Conquerour. They also shew∣ed
me on the top of Mount <HI>Gargasso,</HI> the ruines of that
Temple, which had beene of old dedicated to <HI>Iupiter:</HI> and
upon the second day I hired two Fisher men in a little

The Ile of <HI>Zante</HI> was called <HI>Zacinthus,</HI> because so was

<P>And on the top of a Hill, about the Towne, standeth a
large and strong Fortresse (not unlike the Castle of <HI>Mi∣laine)</HI>
wherein the <HI>Providitore</HI> dwelleth, who governeth
the Iland. This City is subject yearely to fearefull Earth∣quakes,
especially in the Months of <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI>
which oftentimes subvert their houses, and themselves,
bringing deadly destruction on all. This Ile produceth
good store of <HI>Rasini di Corintho,</HI> commonly called Cur∣rants,

some 16. miles.</P>
<P>The Ilanders are <HI>Greeks,</HI> a kinde of subtle people, and
great dissemblers; but the Signiory thereof belongeth to
<HI>Venice.</HI> And if it were not for that great provision of
corne, which is daily transported from the firme land of
<HI>Peleponesus</HI> to them, the inhabitants in short time would
famish.</P>
<P>It was credibly told me here by the better sort, that this

of money which these silly Ilanders could never afford,
(they being not above 60. yeares agoe, but a base beg∣garly
people, and an obscure place) if it were not here in
<HI>England</HI> of late for some liquorous lips, who forsooth
can hardly digest bread, pasties, broth; and (<HI>verbi gratia</HI>)
Bagge-puddings, without these Currants: And as these

expence, contemne justly this sensuall prodigality, I have
heard them often demand the <HI>English</HI> in a filthy derision,
what they did with such Leprous stuffe, and if they carried
them home to feed their Swine and Hogs withall: A que∣stion
indeed worthy of such a female traffick, the inference

4000. peeces of Ordnance, and twelve thousand Chri∣stians
delivered from their slavish bondage. In all, the
Christians losed but eleven Gallies &amp; 5000. slain. At their
returne to <HI>Largostola,</HI> after this victorious battell, the three
Generalls divided innumerable spoyles, to their well-de∣serving
Captains, and worthy souldiers.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> led that <HI>Armado,</HI> yet
ambition led him, who in the midst of that famous victo∣ry,
conceived a treacherous designe, to seize upon the

<P>But before the aforesaid <HI>Caravan</HI> at <HI>Paterasso</HI> admitted
me into his company, hee was wonderfull inquisitive to
know for what cause I travailed alone? and of what Nati∣on
I was? To whom I soberly excused, and discovered
my self with modest answers: which pacified his curiosity;
but not his avaritious mind: for under a pretended pro∣tection
he had of me, hee extorted the most part of my
money from my purse, without any regard of Conscience.</P>
<P>In the first, second, and third dayes journeying, we had
faire way, hard lodging, but good cheare, and kind enter∣tainment
for our money, which was the Country <HI>Laco∣nia.</HI>
But on the fourth day, when we entred in the hilly
and barren Country of <HI>Arcadia;</HI> where for a daies jour∣ney
we had no Village, but saw abundance of Cattell
without keepers; and in that place it is thought the great
<PB N="69" REF="42"/>
battell of <HI>Pharsalia</HI> was fought between <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> and

<P>But because it is a tradition of more antiquity than cre∣dit,
I doe rather note it than affirme it: And as men should
dread the thunder-bolt when they see the lightning, so ig∣norance
and Idolatry placed amongst us, and round about
us, may be a warning to the professours of the truth, to
take heed of the venome, lest by their <HI>Arcadian</HI> antiquity,
surpassing the Moone, they become novices to some new
intended Massacre, for as powder faild them, but alas, not
poison! so now with policy they prevaile in all things: how

are the causes of their <HI>domineering,</HI> &amp; our careles <HI>drooping.</HI></P>
<P>In this desart way I beheld many singular Monuments,

had an ignorant guide: But this I remember, amongst

body, with the climbing of fastidious mountaines, which
bred no small griefe to my breast. Yet notwithstanding

<P>In all this Country of <HI>Greece</HI> I could finde nothing to
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>
answer the famous relations, given by ancient Authors
of the excellency of that land, but the name onely; the
barbarousnesse of <HI>Turkes</HI> and Time, having defaced all
the Monuments of Antiquity: No shew of honour, no
habitation of men in an honest fashion, nor possessours of
the Countrey in a Principality, But rather prisoners shut
up in prison, or addicted slaves to cruell and tyrannicall
Masters: So deformed is the state of that once worthy
Realm, and so miserable is the burthen of that afflicted
people; which, and the appearance of that permanency,
grieved my heart to behold the sinister working of blind
<HI>Fortune,</HI> which alwayes plungeth the most renowned
Champions, and their memory, in the profoundest pit of
all extremities and oblivion.</P>
<P>Let the Ghosts of that <HI>Theban Epaminondas,</HI> that <HI>Mir∣midonian
Phillip,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Greek</HI> Cham∣pions.</NOTE> and these <HI>Epirean</HI> worthies, <HI>Pyrhus,</HI> and
<HI>Scanderberg</HI> be witnesses hereto; but especially, that <HI>Ma∣cedonian
Alexander,</HI> whose fortunes ever followed him,
rather than fled him, till his last dissolution; wherein I may
say his Greatnesse rose, like to a mighty and huge Oak,
being clad with the exuvialls, and Trophies of enemies,
fenced with an Army of boughes, garnished with a coat of
Barke, as hard as steele; dispised the force and power of
the windes, as being onely able to dally with the leaves
and not to weaken the root: But the Northerne winde,
that strong Champion of the airy Region, secretly lur∣king
in the vault of some hollow Cloud, doth first mur∣mure
at the aspiring Oak, and then striketh his Crest
with some great strength; and lastly with the deepest
breath of his Lungs, doth blow up the roote: Even so
was it with <HI>Alexander,</HI> who from a stripling came to be a
Cedar, and from the sorrow of no more worlds, was
soone cut off from the world he was into: For destiny is
<PB N="73" REF="45"/>
no mans drudge, and death is every mans Conquerour,
matching the Scepter with the Spade, and the Crowned
Prince with the praiselesse Peasant: And in a word, there
was never any to whom Fortune did sooner approach, nor
never any from whom shee did more suddenly flye, than
from <HI>Alexander,</HI> leaving him a cleare mirrour of the
worlds inconstancy.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the government of <HI>Greece,</HI> termed
by the <HI>Turkes Rum Ili,</HI> that is, the <HI>Roman</HI> Countrey:
It is ruled by a <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Begler∣beg of <HI>Greece</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Bassa,</HI> this word <HI>Beg∣lerbeg</HI>
imports Lord of Lords, in regard of the <HI>San∣zacks,</HI>
or <HI>Subbassaes</HI> under them, who also are ter∣med
Lords; which is a Barbarous pride in an ambitious
stile: This <HI>Beglerbeg</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> retaineth his resi∣dence
at <HI>Sophia</HI> the <HI>Metropole</HI> of <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> formerly
<HI>Dacia,</HI> and is the most greatest Commaunder of
all other <HI>Bassaes</HI> in the Turkish provinces of <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI></P>
<P>All other <HI>Beglerbegs</HI> are changed every third yeare,
or continued according to the Imperiall pleasure, nei∣ther
may they returne from their station during this
time. But this <HI>Bassa</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> keepeth his govern∣ment
for his life-time, and remaineth most at Court: He
reserveth under his command, forty thousand <HI>Timari∣ots</HI>
or Horse-men, led under the conduct of twenty
two <HI>Sanzacks,</HI> or Judges deputies of Jurisdictions; to wit,
two in <HI>Albania,</HI> at the Townes <HI>Iscodera,</HI> and <HI>An∣colina:</HI>

<P>Departing from <HI>Argos,</HI> upon the seventh day we arri∣ved

at last it was sacked by <HI>Lysander,</HI> and her Virgin body
prostituted to the lust of 30. insulting Tyrants: not long
after whose expulsion, it was utterly subdued by the <HI>Mace∣donians.</HI></P>
<P>And in a word, <HI>Athens</HI> being stained with intestine
blood-sheds, and grievously discontented with the death
of her Children; her babes were brought forth for the
sword to glut upon, the bodyes of her Ancients were
made as pavements to walk upon, her Matrons became
a prey and prize to every Ravisher, and her Priests and
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
Sacrificers were slaine before the gates of their Temples.</P>
<P>This City was the Mother and Well-spring of all Libe∣rall
Arts and Sciences, and the great Cisterne of <HI>Europe,</HI>
whence flowed so many Conduit pipes of learning all
where, but now altogether decayed: The circuit of old
<HI>Athens</HI> hath beene according to the fundimentall walls
yet extant about sixe <HI>Italian</HI> miles, but now of no great
quantity, nor many dwelling houses therein; being with∣in
two hundred fire-houses, having a Castle, which for∣merly
was the Temple of <HI>Minerva.</HI> They have abun∣dance
of all things requisite for the sustenance of humane
life, of which I had no small proofe: for these <HI>Atheni∣ans</HI>
or <HI>Greeks,</HI> exceeding kindly banqueted mee foure
dayes, and furnisht me with necessary provision for my
voyage to <HI>Creta.</HI> And also transported mee by Sea in a
<HI>Brigandino</HI> freely, and on their owne charges to <HI>Serigo,</HI>
being 44. miles distant.</P>
<P>After my redounded thankes, they having returned,
the contemplation of their courtesies brought me in re∣membrance
how curious the old <HI>Athenians</HI> were to heare
of forreigne newes, and with what great regard and esti∣mation
they honoured travellers, of which as yet they are
no wayes defective.</P>
<P><HI>Serigo</HI> is an Iland in the sea <HI>Cretico:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Serigo.</NOTE> It was anciently
called <HI>Cytherea,</HI> of <HI>Cythero</HI> the Sonne of <HI>Phaenise:</HI> And of <HI>A∣ristotle
Porphyris,</HI> or <HI>Schotera,</HI> in respect of the fine Marble
that is got there: It is of circuit threescore miles, having
but one Castle called <HI>Capsallo,</HI> which is kept by a <HI>Venetian</HI>
Captaine: here it is said that <HI>Venus</HI> did first inhabit, and I
saw the ruines of her demolished Temple, on the side of a
Mountaine yet extant.</P>
<P>A little more downward below this old adored
Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> are the Reliques of that Palace, where∣in
<PB N="76" REF="47"/>
<HI>Menelaus</HI> did dwell, who was King of <HI>Sparta,</HI> &amp; Lord
of this Ile. The <HI>Greeks</HI> of the Ile told me there were wild
Asses there, who had a stone in their heads, which was a
soveraigne remedy for the Falling sicknesse, and good to
make a woman be quickly delivered of her birth. I made
afterward deeper enquiry for it, to have either seene
or bought it, but for my life I could never attaine to any
perfect knowledge thereof.</P>
<P>In the time of my abode at the Village of <HI>Capsalo</HI> (be∣ing
a haven for small Barks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Priest slain in a Bordell.</NOTE> and scituate below the Castle)
the Captaine of that same Fortresse kild a Seminary
Priest, whom he had found in the night with his whoore

the Governour of the Isle deposed the Captaine, and bani∣shed
him, causing a Boate to be prepared to send him to

what a sea of Sodomiticall irreligious blood
would overflow the halfe of <HI>Europe,</HI> to staine the spot∣ted
colour of that <HI>Roman</HI> beast. Truely, and yet more,
these lascivious Friars are the very Epicures, or off-scou∣rings

most famous and ancient Kingdome: By moderne writers,
it is called Queene of the Iles <HI>Medeterrene:</HI> It had of old an
hundred Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The antiqui∣ty of <HI>Candy.</HI></NOTE> whereof it had the name <HI>Hecatompolis,</HI> but
now onely foure, <HI>Candia, Canea, Rethimos,</HI> and <HI>Scithia,</HI> the

and <HI>Capo Salomone</HI> in the East, two hundred and forty
Miles, large threescore, and of circuit sixe hundred and fif∣ty

<P>This is the chiefe Dominion belonging to the <HI>Venetian</HI>
Reipublicke: In every one of these foure Cities there is
a Governour, and two Counsellors, sent from <HI>Venice</HI> every
two years. The Country is divided into foure parts, under
the jurisdiction of the foure Cities, for the better admini∣stration
of Justice: and they have a General who common∣ly
remaineth in the City of <HI>Candi</HI> (like to a Vice-roy) who
deposeth, or imposeth Magistrates, Captaines, Souldiers,
Officers, and others whatsoever, in the behalfe of St. <HI>Mark,</HI>
or Duke of <HI>Venice.</HI> The <HI>Venetians</HI> detaine continually a
strong guard, divided in Companies, Squadrons, and Gar∣risons,
in the Cities and Fortresses of the Iland: which
doe extend to the number of 12000. Souldiers, kept not
onely for the incursions of Turks, but also for feare of the
<HI>Cretes</HI> or inhabitants, who would rather (if they could)
render to the <HI>Turke,</HI> than to live under the subjection of
<HI>Venice,</HI> thinking thereby to have more liberty, and lesse

<P>Thus much of the Ile in generall; and now in respect of
my travailing two times through the bounds of the
whole Kingdome, which was never before attchieved by
any Travailer in Christendome; I will as briefely as I can
in particular, relate a few of those miseries endured by me
in this land, with the nature and quality of the people.</P>
<P>This aforesaid <HI>Carabusa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The old and famous City of <HI>Lanarke.</HI></NOTE> is the principall Fortresse of
<HI>Creta,</HI> being of it selfe invincible, and is not unlike to the
Castle of <HI>Dunbertan,</HI> which standeth at the mouth of
<HI>Clyd;</HI> upon which River the ancient City of <HI>Lanarke</HI> is
scituated: for this Fort is environed with a Rock higher
than the walls, and joyneth close with <HI>Capo Ermico:</HI> ha∣ving
learned of the theevish way I had to <HI>Canea,</HI> I advised
to put my money in exchange, which the Captaine of
that strength very courteously performed; and would also
have disswaded me from my purpose, but I by no perswa∣sion
of him would stay. From thence departing all alone,
scarcely was I advanced twelve miles in my way, when
I was beset on the skirt of a Rocky Mountaine, with
three <HI>Greeke</HI> murthering <HI>Renegadoes,</HI> and an <HI>Italian Ban∣dido,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>
who laying hands on me, beat me most cruelly, robed
me of all my cloaths, and stripped me naked, threatning
me with many grievous speeches.</P>
<P>At last the respective <HI>Italian,</HI> perceiving I was a stranger,
and could not speak the <HI>Cretan</HI> tongue, began to aske me
in his owne language where was my money? to whom
I soberly answered, I had no more than hee saw, which
was fourescore Bagantines: which scarely amounted to
two groats English: but hee not giving credit to these
words, searched all my Cloathes and <HI>Budgeto,</HI> yet found
nothing, except my linnen, and Letters of recommendati∣ons,
I had from divers Princes of Christendome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A happy de∣liverance.</NOTE> especially
the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> whose subjects they were, if they had
beene lawfull Subjects: which when hee saw, did
move him to compassion, and earnestly entreated the
other three theeves to grant me mercy, and to save my
life: A long deliberation being ended, they restored
backe againe my pilgrimes Cloathes, and Letters, but my
blew Gowne and Bagantines they kept: such also was
their theevish Courtesie towards me, that for my better
safeguard in the way, they gave me a stamped piece of clay,
as a token to shew any of their companions, if I encoun∣tred
with any of them; for they were about twenty Ras∣calls
of a confederate band; that lay in this desart pas∣sage.</P>
<P>Leaving them with many counterfeit thankes, I travai∣led
that day seven and thirty Miles, and at night attained
to the unhappy Village of <HI>Pickehorno:</HI> where I could
have neither meate, drinke, lodging, nor any refresh∣ment
to my wearied body. These desperate <HI>Candiors</HI>
thronged about me, gazing (as though astonished) to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee
me both want company, and their Language, and by their
cruell lookes, they seemed to be a barbarous uncivill

people: For all these High-landers of <HI>Candy,</HI> are tyran∣nicall,
blood-thirsty, and deceitfull.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruell <HI>Can∣diots.</HI></NOTE> The consideration
of which, and the appearance of my death, signed to mee
secretly by a pittifull woman, made mee to shunne their
villany in stealing forth from them in the darke night, &amp;
privately sought for a secure place of repose in a umbragi∣ous
Cave by the Sea side, where I lay till Morning with
a fearefull heart, a crased body, a thirsty stomacke, and a
hungry belly.</P>
<P>Upon the appearing of the next <HI>Aurora,</HI> and when the
welkin had put aside the vizard of the night, the Starres
being covered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invinsibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a.</HI></NOTE> and the earth discovered by the Sunne, I
imbraced my unknowne way, and about mid-day came
to <HI>Canea: Canea</HI> is the second City of <HI>Creete,</HI> called anci∣ently
<HI>Cydon,</HI> being exceeding populous, well Walled,
and fortified with Bulwarks: It hath a large Castle, con∣taining
ninety seven Pallaces, in which the Rector and
other <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentlemen dwell. There lye continually
in it seven Companies of Souldiers who keepe Centinell
on the Walls, guard the gates and Market places of
the City: Neither in this Towne nor <HI>Candia,</HI> may any
Countrey peasant enter with weapons (especially Har∣quebuses)
for that conceived feare they have of Treason.
Truely this City may equall in strength, either <HI>Zara</HI> in
<HI>Dalmetia,</HI> or <HI>Luka,</HI> or <HI>Ligorne,</HI> both in <HI>Tuscana,</HI> or match∣lesse
<HI>Palma</HI> in <HI>Friuly:</HI> for these five Cities are so strong,
that in all my Travaile I never saw them matched. They
are all well provided with aboundance of Artillery, and
all necessary things for their defence, especially <HI>Luk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
which continually reserves in store provision of victualls
for twelve yeares siege.</P>
<P>In my first abode in <HI>Canea,</HI> being a fortnight, there came
6. Gallies from <HI>Venice,</HI> upon one of which there was a
<PB N="82" REF="50"/>
young <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, a Protestant, borne neare
<HI>Monpeillier</HI> in <HI>Langadocke;</HI> who being by chance in com∣pany
with other foure of his Countrey-men in <HI>Venice,</HI>
one of them killed a young noble <HI>Venetien,</HI> about the
quarrell of a Curtezan: Whereupon they flying to the
<HI>French</HI> Ambassadours house, the rest escaped, and he one∣ly
apprehended by a fall in his flight, was afterward
condemned by the Senators to the Gallyes induring
life. Now the Gallyes lying here sixe dayes, he got leave
of the Captaine to come a shoare with a Keeper, when
he would, carrying an Irom bolt on his legge: In which
time wee falling in acquaintance, he complained heavily
of his hard fortune, and how because he was a Protestant,
(besides his slavery) he was severely abused in the Galley;
sighing forth these words with teares, <HI>Lord have mercy
upon mee, and grant me patience, for neither friends, nor
money can redeeme mee:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Religious comfort.</NOTE> At which expression I was both
glad and sorrowfull, the one moving my soule to exult in
joy for his Religion: the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, for his misfortunes, wor∣king
a Christian condolement for intollerable affliction:
For I was in <HI>Venice,</HI> at that same time when this accident
fell out, yet would not tell him so much: But pondering
seriously his lamentable distresse, I secretly advised him
the manner how he might escape, and how farre I would
hazard the liberty of my life for his deliverance, desiring
him to come a shoare early the next morning. Meane
while I went to an old <HI>Greekish</HI> woman, with whom I was
friendly inward, for shee was my Landresse; and reciting
to her the whole businesse, she willingly condiscended to
lend me an old Gowne, and a blacke vaile for his disguise∣ment.
The time came, and we met, the matter was diffi∣cult
to shake off the Keeper; but such was my plot, I did
invite him to the Wine, where after tractall dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourses,
<PB N="83" REF="50"/>
and deepe draughts of <HI>Leatick,</HI> reason failing, sleepe
over-came his sences. Whereupon conducting my friend
to the appointed place, I disburdened him of his Irons,
clothed him in a female habite, and sent him out before
mee, conducted by the <HI>Greekish</HI> woman: and when se∣curely
past both Guard and Gate, I followed, carrying
with mee his cloathes, where, when accoasting him by a
field of Olives, and the other returned backe, we speedily
crossed the Vale of <HI>Suda,</HI> and interchanging his appar∣rell,
I directed him the way over the Mountaines to a
<HI>Greekish</HI> convent on the South side of the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A place of refuge.</NOTE> a place
of safe-guard, called commonly the Monastery of refuge;
where hee would kindly bee entertained, till either the
Gallyes, or men of Warre of <HI>Malta</HI> arrived: It being a
custome at their going, or comming from the <HI>Levante</HI> to
touch heere, to releeve and carry away distressed men:
This is a place whereunto <HI>Bandits,</HI> men-slayers, and rob∣bers
repaire for reliefe.</P>
<P>And now many joyfull thankes from him redounded,
I returned, keeping the high way, where incontinent I en∣countred
two <HI>English</HI> Souldiers, <HI>Iohn Smith,</HI> and <HI>Thomas
Hargrave,</HI> comming of purpose to informe me of an Imi∣nent
danger, shewing me that all the Officers of the Gal∣lyes,
with a number of Souldiers were in searching the
City, and hunting all over the fields for me: after which
relation, consulting with them, what way I could come
to the <HI>Italian</HI> Monastery Saint <HI>Salvator,</HI> for there I say;
(the vulgar Towne affording neither lodging nor beds)
They answered me, they would venture their lives for my
liberty, and I should enter at the Easterne (the least fre∣quented)
Gate of the City, where three other <HI>English</HI>
men lay that day on Guard, for so there were five of
them here in Garison: where when wee came, the other
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>
<HI>English</HI> accompanied with eight <HI>French</HI> souldiers their
familiars, came along with us also: And having past the
Market place, and neare my lodging, foure officers and
sixe Gally souldiers runne to lay hold on mee: whereat
the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> unsheathing their swords, vali∣antly
resisted their fury, and deadly wounded two of the
Officers: Meane while fresh supply comming from the
Gallyes, <HI>Iohn Smith</HI> runne along with me to the Mona∣stery,
leaving the rest at <HI>pell mell,</HI> to intercept their fol∣lowing:
At the last the Captaines of the Garrison approa∣ching
the tumult, relieved their owne Souldiars, and
drove backe the other to the Gallyes. A little thereafter
the Generall of the Gallyes came to the Monastary, and
examined mee concerning the fugitive, but I clearing
my selfe so, and quenching the least suspition hee might
conceive (notwithstanding of my accusers) hee could lay
nothing to my charge: howsoever it was, hee seemed
somewhat favourable; partly because I had the Duke of
<HI>Venice</HI> his Pasport, partly because of my intended voyage
to <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> partly because he was a great favourer of the
<HI>French</HI> Nation: and partly because hee could not mend
himselfe, in regard of my shelter, and the Governours fa∣vour:
yet neverthelesse I detained my selfe under safeguard
of the Cloyster untill the Gallyes were gone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloysters are safeguards.</NOTE></P>
<P>Being here disappoynted of transportation to <HI>Archipe∣lago,</HI>
I advised to visit <HI>Candy:</HI> and in my way I past by
the large Haven of <HI>Suda,</HI> which hath no Towne or Vil∣lage,
save onely a Castle, scituated on a Rock in the Sea, at
the entry of the Bay: the bounds of that harbour may
receive at one time above two thousand Ships and
Gallyes, and is the onely Key of the Iland: for the which
place, the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath oft offered an infinite
deale of money to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> whereby his Nav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>
which sometimes resort in the <HI>Levante,</HI> might have ac∣cesse
and reliefe; but they would never grant him his re∣quest;
which policy of his was onely to have surprized the
Kingdome.</P>
<P>South-west from this famous harbour, lyeth a pleasant
plaine, sirnamed the Vally of <HI>Suda:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pleasant vally of <HI>Suda.</HI></NOTE> It is twenty <HI>Italian</HI>
Miles long, and two of breadth: And I remember as I de∣scended
to crosse the Valley, and passe the Haven, me
thought the whole planure resembled to me a green sea;
and that was onely by reason of infinite Olive trees grew
there, whose boughes and leaves over-top all other fructi∣ferous
trees in that plaine: The Villages for losse of
ground are all built on the skirts of Rocks, upon the
South-side of the Valley, yea and so difficult to climbe
them, &amp; so dangerous to dwell in them, that me thought
their lives were in like perill, as he who was adjoyned to
sit under the point of a two-handed sword, and it hanging
by the haire of a horse taile.</P>
<P>Trust me, I told along these Rocks at one time, and
within my sight some 67. Villages; but when I entred
the Valley, I could not finde a foote of ground unmanu∣red,
save a narrow passing way wherein I was: The Olives,
Pomgranets, Dates, Figges, Orenges, Lemmons, and
<HI>Pomi del Adamo</HI> growing all through other: And at
the rootes of which trees grew Wheat, Maluasie, Musca∣dine,
Leaticke Wines, Grenadiers, Carnobiers, Mel∣lones,
and all other sorts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruits and Herbes the earth
can yeeld to man; that for beauty, pleasure, and profit it
may easily bee sirnamed the garden of the whole Vni∣verse:
being the goodliest plot, the Diamond sparke, and
the Honey spot of all <HI>Candi:</HI> There is no land more tem∣perate
for ayre, for it hath a double spring-tide; no soyle
more fertile, and therefore it is called the Combate of

<HI>Bacus,</HI> and <HI>Ceres;</HI> nor Region or Valley more hospita∣ble,
in regard of the Sea, having such a noble Haven cut
through its bosome, being as it were the very resting
place of <HI>Neptune.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the third dayes journey from <HI>Canea,</HI> I came to
<HI>Rethimos;</HI> this City is somewhat ruinous, and unwalled,
but the Citizens have newly builded a strong Fortresse,
but rather done by the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> which defendeth
them from the invasion of Pyrats: It standeth by the sea
side, and in the yeare 1597. it was miserably sacked, and
burned with <HI>Turkes.</HI> Continuing this voyage, I passed
along the skirts of Mount <HI>Ida,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mount Ida.</HI></NOTE> accompanied with <HI>Greeks,</HI>
who could speake the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue, on which, first they
shewed me the Cave of King <HI>Minos,</HI> but some hold it to be
the Sepulcher of <HI>Iupiter.</HI> That <HI>Groto</HI> was of length eighty
paces, and eight large: This <HI>Minos</HI> was said to bee the
brother of <HI>Radamanthus,</HI> and <HI>Sarpedon;</HI> who after their
succession to the Kingdome, established such aequitable
Lawes, that by Poets they are feigned with <HI>Aeacus</HI> to bee
the Judges of Hell. I saw also there, the place where <HI>Iupi∣ter</HI>
(as they say) was nourished by <HI>Amalthes,</HI> which by
<HI>Greekes</HI> is recited, as well as Latine Poets.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they shewed mee the Temple of <HI>Saturne,</HI>
which is a worke to be admired, of such Antiquity, and
as yet undecayed; who (say they) was the first King that
inhabited there, and Father to <HI>Iupiter.</HI> And neare to it,
is the demolished Temple of <HI>Matelia,</HI> having this su∣perscription
above the doore, yet to bee seene: <HI>Make
cleane your feete, wash your hands and enter.</HI> Fourthly, I
saw the entry into the Laborinth of <HI>Dedalus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dedal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s La∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orinth.</NOTE> which I
would gladly have better viewed, but because we had no
Candle-light, wee durst not enter: for there are many
hollow places within it; so that if a man stumble, or fall,
<PB N="85" REF="52"/>
he can hardly be rescued: It is cut forth with many intri∣cating
wayes, on the face of a little Hill, joyning with
Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> having many doores and pillars. Here it was
where <HI>Theseus</HI> by the helpe of <HI>Ariadne</HI> the daughter of
King <HI>Minos,</HI> taking a bottome of threed, and tying the
one end at the first doore, did enter and slay the <HI>Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣taurus,</HI>

<P>Mount <HI>Ida</HI> is the highest Mountaine in <HI>Creta,</HI> and by
the computation of Shepheards feete, amounteth to sixe
miles of hight: It is over-clad even to the toppe with
<HI>Cypre</HI> trees, and good store of medicinable hearbes: in∣somuch
that the beasts which feede thereupon, have their
teeth gilded, like to the colour of Gold: Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> of
old was called <HI>Phelorita,</HI> by some <HI>Cadussa,</HI> but modernely
<HI>Madura:</HI> It is said by some Historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Historia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> erro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> that no vene∣mous
animall can live in this Ile; but I saw the contrary:
for I kild on a Sunday morning hard by the Sea side,
and within two miles of <HI>Rethimos,</HI> two Serpents and a
Viper: one of which Serpents was above a yard and
halfe in length, for they being all three rolling within the
coverture of the dry sands, my right legge was almost in
their reverence before I remarked the danger: wherefore
many build upon false reports, but experience teacheth
men the truth.</P>
<P>Some others also Historize, that if a Woman here, bite
a man any thing hard, hee will never recover: and that
there is an hearbe called <HI>Allimos</HI> in this Iland, which if one
chaw in his mouth, he shall not feele hunger for foure and
twenty houres: all which are meere fabulous, such is the
darkenesse of cloudy inventions.</P>
<P>Descending from this Mountaine, I entred in a faire
<PB N="88" REF="53"/>
plaine, beautified with many Villages; in one of which I
found a <HI>Grecian</HI> Bishop, who kindly presented me with
grapes of <HI>Maluasie,</HI> and other things, for it was in the
time of their vintage. To carry these things he had given
me, he caused to make ready an Asse, and a servant, who
went with me to <HI>Candy,</HI> which was more than fifteene
miles from his house. True it is, that the best sort of
<HI>Greekes,</HI> in visiting other, doe not use to come empty han∣ded,
neither will they suffer a stranger to depart without
both gifts and convoy.</P>
<P>I remember along this sassinous and marine passage, I
found three fountaines gushing forth of a Rock, each one
within a yard of other, having three sundry tastes: the first
water was exceeding light and sweet; the middle or second
marvellous soure and heavy: the third was bitter and ex∣traordinary
salt: so that inso short bounds so great diffe∣rence
I never found before, nor afterward.</P>
<P><HI>Candy</HI> is distant from <HI>Canea</HI> a hundred Miles, <HI>Rethimos</HI>
being halfe way betwixt both: so is <HI>Candy</HI> halfe way
in the same measure, twixt <HI>Rethimos</HI> and <HI>Scythia;</HI> and <HI>Ca∣nea</HI>
the like twixt <HI>Rethimos</HI> and <HI>Carabusa</HI> being in all 200
Miles.</P>
<P><HI>Candy</HI> is a large and famous City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of Candy.</NOTE> formerly called <HI>Mati∣um,</HI>
scituated on a plaine by the sea side, having a goodly
Haven for ships, and a faire Arsenell wherein are 36. Gal∣lies:
It is exceeding strong, and daily guarded with 2000.
Souldiers, and the walles in compasse are about three
Leagues.</P>
<P>In this time there was no Vice-Roy, the former being
newly dead, and the place vacant, the Souldiers kept a
bloody quarter among themselves, or against any whom∣soever
their malignity was intended, for in all the time I
stayed there, being ten dayes, it was nothing to see every
<PB N="89" REF="53"/>
day foure or five men killed in the streetes: neither could
the Rector, nor the Captains helpe it, so tumultuous
were the disordered Souldiers, and the occasions of re∣venge
and quarrelling so influent. This commonly they
practise in every such like vacation, which otherwise they
durst never attempt without death, and severe punish∣ment;
and truely me thought it was as barbarous a gover∣ned
place for the time, as ever I saw in the world, for
hardly could I save my owne life free from their dangers,
in the which I was twice miserably involved.</P>
<P><HI>Candy</HI> is distant from <HI>Venice</HI> 1300 Miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distances from <HI>Candy.</HI></NOTE> from <HI>Constan∣tinople</HI>

of <HI>Natolia</HI> 400, and from the City of <HI>Ierusalem</HI>
900 Miles. The <HI>Candeots</HI> through all the Island make
muster every eight day, before the Seriant-Majors, or
Officers of the Generall, and are well provided with all
sorts of Armour; yea, and the most valorous people that
hight the name of <HI>Greekes.</HI> It was told mee by the Rector
of <HI>Candy,</HI> that they may raise in Armes of the Inhabitants
(not reckoning the Garrisons) above sixty thousand men,
all able for warres, with 54 Gallies, and 24 Galleots for
the Sea.</P>
<P>In all my Travells through this Realm, I never could

the Countrey is over-charged like unto little bushes or

<P>The <HI>Candiots</HI> are excellent good Archers, surpassing
all the Orientall people therein, couragious and valiant
upon the Sea, as in former times they were; and they are
naturally inclined to singing, so that commonly after
meat, Man, Wife, and Childe of each family, will for the

melodious to the hearer; yea, and they cannot
forgoe the custome of it.</P>
<P>Their Harvest is our Spring: for they manure the
ground, and sow the seed in <HI>October,</HI> which is reaped in
<HI>March,</HI> and <HI>Aprill.</HI> Being frustrate of my intention at
<HI>Candy,</HI> I was forced to returne to <HI>Canea</HI> the same way I
went: when come, I was exceeding merry with my old
friends the English-men:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unnagate.</NOTE> Meane while there arrived from
<HI>Tunnis</HI> in <HI>Barbary,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Runagate named <HI>Wolson,</HI>
bound for the <HI>Rhodes:</HI> where after short acquaintance
with his Natives, and understanding what I was, he
imparted these words, I have had my elder brother,
said hee, the Master (or Captaine) of a Ship slaine at
<PB N="91" REF="55"/>
<HI>Burnt Iland</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> by one called <HI>Keere;</HI> and not∣withstanding
he was beheaded, I have long since sworne,
to be revenged of my brothers death, on the first <HI>Scots∣man</HI>
I ever saw or met, and my designe is to stob him
with a knife this night, as he goeth late home to his lodg∣ing
desiring their assistance: but <HI>Smith, Hargrave,</HI> and
<HI>Horsf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ild</HI> refused, yet <HI>Cooke</HI> and <HI>Rollands</HI> yeelded. Mean∣while
<HI>Smith</HI> knowing where I used sometimes to diet,
found me at supper in a Suttlers, a souldiers house, where
acquainting me with this plot, the Host, he, and three <HI>Ita∣lian</HI>
souldiers conveighed me to my bed, passing by the
arch-villaine, and his confederates, where he was prepa∣red
for the mischiefe: which when hee saw his treachery
was discovered, he fled away, and was seene no more here.</P>
<P>Remarking the fidelity and kindnesse that <HI>Smith</HI> had
twice shewne me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith relie∣ved from long bonda</NOTE> first from freeing me from the danger of
Galley-slavery, and now in saving my life, I advised to do
him a good deed in some part of acquittance, and thus it
was: At his first comming to <HI>Venice,</HI> he was taken up as
a Souldier for <HI>Candy:</HI> where, when transported, within a
small time he found the Captaines promise and perfor∣mance
different, which inforced him at the beginning to
borrow a little money of his Lieutenant: the five yeares
of their abode expired, and fresh Companies come from
<HI>Venice</HI> to exhibite the charge, <HI>Smith</HI> not being able to
discharge his debt, was turned over to the new Captaine
for five yeares more, who paied the old Captaine his mo∣ny;
and his time also worne out, the third Captaine came,
where likewise he was put in his hands serving him five
yeares longer.</P>
<P>Thus having served three Captains fifteene yeares, and
never likely able (for a small trifle) to attaine his li∣berty,
I went to the Captaine and payed his debt, obtai∣ning
<PB N="92" REF="56"/>
also of the Rector his licence to depart; and the al∣lowance
of the State for his passage, which was Wine and
Biscot-bread: Thereafter I imbarked him for <HI>Venice</HI> in
a <HI>Flemish</HI> ship, the Master being a <HI>Scotsman, Iohn Allen</HI>
borne in <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and dwelt at <HI>Middleborough</HI> in <HI>Zeland,</HI>
his debt was onely forty eight shillings sterling.</P>
<P>Here I stayed in <HI>Canea</HI> twenty five dayes before I could
get passage for the Arch Ilands, being purposed for <HI>Con∣stantinople;</HI>
but gladly would not have left the Monastary
of these foure Friars, with whom I was lodged, if it had
not beene for my designes; in regard of their great cheere
and deepe draughts of Maluasey I received hourely, and
oftentimes against my will: every night after supper, the
Friars forced me to dance with them, either one gagli∣ard
or other: Their Musicke in the end was sound drun∣kennesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drunken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri∣ers.</NOTE>
and their <HI>Syncopa</HI> turnd to spew up all, and their
bed converted to a board, or else the hard floore, for
these beastly swine were nightly so full, that they had ne∣ver
power to goe to their owne Chambers, but where
they fell, there they lay till the morne: The Cloyster it
selfe had two faire Courts, the least of which might have
lodged any King of <HI>Europe:</HI> The Church was little, and
among the foure Friars, there was but one Masse-Priest,
being a <HI>Greek</HI> borne, and turn'd to the <HI>Roman</HI> Faction: his
new name was <HI>Pattarras Matecarras, Pater Libenter,</HI> or
Father of free Will, indeed a right name for so sottish a
fellow, for he was so free of his stomacke to receive in
strong liquor, that for the space of twenty daies of my be∣ing
there, I never saw him, nor any one of the other three
truely sober. Many cdde merriments and jests have I ob∣served
of these Friers of <HI>Candi,</HI> but time will not suffer
me to relate them, onely remitting the rest to my private
discourse, a Figge for their folly.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="56"/>
I travailed on foot in this Isle more than foure hundred
Miles, and upon the fifty eight day after my first com∣ming
to <HI>Carabusa,</HI> I imbarked in a Fisher-boat that be∣longed
to <HI>Milo,</HI> being a hundred Miles distant, which
had beene violently driven thither with stormy wea∣ther.</P>
<P>And in our passing thither, we were in danger to be
over-runne two severall times, with two huge broken
Seas, which twice covered the body of the close boat:
yet with extream fortune wee arrived at <HI>Milo</HI> in a bay of
the East corner of the Isle, being about St. <HI>Andrews</HI> day,
where the poore <HI>Greeks</HI> tooke me up to their Village, two
miles distant from this <HI>Creeke,</HI> and I abode with them
foure dayes.</P>
<P><HI>Milo</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Milo.</NOTE> was called by <HI>Aristotle, Melada,</HI> and by others,
<HI>Mimalida, Melos:</HI> And lastly <HI>Milo,</HI> because of the fine
Mill-stones that are got there, which are transported to
<HI>Constantinople, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Natolia.</HI> This Isle is one of
the Isles <HI>Cyclades,</HI> or <HI>Sporades,</HI> but more commonly <HI>Ar∣chipelago,</HI>
or the Arch-Islands, and standeth in the begin∣ning
of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea: The Inhabitants are <HI>Greekes,</HI>
but slaves to the <HI>Turke,</HI> and so are all the fifty foure Isles
of the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> save onely <HI>Tino,</HI> which holdeth of the
<HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Milo</HI> I came to <HI>Zephano,</HI> in a small boat, an Island
of circuit about twenty Miles, and ten miles distant from
<HI>Milo:</HI> The Inhabitants are poore, yet kind people: There
are an infinite number of Partridges within this Isle, of a
reddish colour, and bigger than ours in <HI>Brittaine:</HI>
They are wild, and onely killed by small shot; but I
have seene in other Isands flocks of them feeding in the
fields, and usually kept by Children: some others I
have seene in the streetes of Villages, without any keeper,
<PB N="92" REF="57"/>
even as our Hennes doe with us. I saw Fountaines heere,
that naturally yeeld fine Oyle, which is the greatest ad∣vantage
the Ilanders have.</P>
<P><HI>Zephano</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zephano.</NOTE> did once produce the <HI>Calamita,</HI> and was re∣nowned
for the fine Mines of Gold and Silver, of which
now it is altogether desolate: There is also fine Sulphur
here, and exceeding good Marble: from whence <HI>Lucul∣lus</HI>
was the first that transported it to <HI>Rome:</HI> There is a
certaine ground in this Ile, where it is said, that if any
take it away, or digge deepe holes, the earth of it selfe in
a small time will surcease without any ayde of man. East
from <HI>Milo</HI> and <HI>Zephano,</HI> lye the Iles <HI>Policandro,</HI> and
<HI>Christiana,</HI> formerly <HI>Laguso, Sicandro;</HI> and <HI>Sasurnino,</HI>
anciently <HI>Calistha,</HI> famous for the birth of the Poet
<HI>Calimachus.</HI></P>
<P>From thence I imbarked, and arrived at <HI>Angusa</HI> in <HI>Pa∣rir:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parir.</NOTE>
This Ile is forty miles long, and sixe miles broad:
being plentifull enough in all necessary things for the use
of man: It was anciently called <HI>Demetriado,</HI> whose length
lyeth South-west, and North-east: and hard by the high
Mountaine of <HI>Camphasia,</HI> neere to <HI>Angusa,</HI> on a faire Val∣ley
standeth the ancient Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> never a whit
decayed to this day: This Ile was given to the <HI>Venetians</HI>
by <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Emperour, and brother
to <HI>Baldwin</HI> Earle of <HI>Flanders:</HI> and it was seazed upon by
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> when <HI>Nigropont,</HI> and divers other Iles were
surprised from the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Angusa</HI> I stayed sixteene dayes, storme-sted with
Northernely winds; and in all that time I never came in
bed: for my lodging was in a little Chappell a mile with∣out
the Village, on hard stones; where I also had a fire,
and dressed my meate. The <HI>Greekes</HI> visited mee often∣times,
&amp; intreated me above all things, I should not enter
<PB N="95" REF="57"/>
within the bounds of their Sanctuary; because I was not
of their Religion. But I in regard of the longsome and
cold nights, was inforced every night to creepe in the
midst of the Sanctuary to keepe my selfe warme, which
Sanctuary was nothing but an Altar hemb'd in with a
partition wall about my height, dividing the little roome
from the body of the Chappell.</P>
<P>These miserable Ilanders, are a kind of silly poore peo∣ple;
which in their behaviour, shewed the necessity they
had to live, rather then any pleasure in their living. From
thence I imbarked on a small barke of ten Tunnes come
from <HI>Scithia</HI> in <HI>Candy,</HI> and loaden with Oyle, and about
mid-day we arrived in the Ile of <HI>Mecano,</HI> where wee but
only dined; and so set forward to <HI>Zea.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Mecano</HI> was formerly called <HI>Delos,</HI> famous for the
Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> being the chiefe Ile of the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> the
rest of the 54. incircling it: <HI>Delos</HI> signifieth apparant, be∣cause
at the request of <HI>Iuno,</HI> when all the earth had abjured
the receipt of <HI>Latona:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Latona recei∣ved in Delos.</NOTE> This Iland then under the water,

<P>In this Ile they retaine a Custome, neither permitting
men to dye, or children to be borne in it: but alwayes
when men fall sicke, and women grow great bellied,
they send them to <HI>Rhena</HI> a small <HI>Isoletta,</HI> and two miles
distant.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="58"/>
<HI>Zea</HI> to which we arrived from <HI>Mecano,</HI> was so called
of <HI>Zeo,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Phebo;</HI> and of some <HI>Tetrapoli;</HI> be∣cause
of the foure Cityes that were there of old. <HI>Symo∣nides</HI>
the Poet, and <HI>Eristato</HI> the excellent Physitian,
were borne in it. The next Isle of any note we touched
at, was <HI>Tino:</HI> This Island is under the Signory of <HI>Venice,</HI>
and was sometimes beautified with the Temple of <HI>Nep∣tune.</HI>
By <HI>Aristotle</HI> it was called <HI>Idrusa;</HI> of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI>
and <HI>Eschines, Erusea:</HI> It hath an impregnable Castle,
builded on the top of a high Rocke, towards the East,
end or <HI>Promontore</HI> of the Isle, and ever provided with
three yeares provision, and a Garrison of two hundred
Souldiers: So that the <HI>Turkes</HI> by no means can conquer
it. The Isle it selfe is twenty Miles in length, and a great
refuge for all Christian ships and Gallyes that haunt in the
<HI>Levante.</HI></P>
<P>From this Isle I came to <HI>Palmosa,</HI> sometimes <HI>Pathmos,</HI>
which is a Mountainous and barren Iland:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ile of <HI>Pathmos.</HI></NOTE> It was here
that Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> wrote the <HI>Revelation</HI> after he was banished
by <HI>Domitianus</HI> the Emperour. Thence I imbarked to
<HI>Nicaria,</HI> and sailed by the Isle <HI>Scyro;</HI> which of old was
the Signory of <HI>Licomedes,</HI> and in the habit of a woman
was <HI>Achilles</HI> brought up here, because his Mother being
by an Oracle premonished, that he should be killed in
the <HI>Trojan</HI> Warre, sent him to this Island; where he was
maiden-like brought up amongst the Kings Daughters:
who in that time begot <HI>Pyrhus</HI> upon <HI>Deidamia,</HI> the
daughter of <HI>Licomedes,</HI> and where the crafty <HI>Vlysses</HI> af∣terward
did discover this fatall Prince to <HI>Troy.</HI> As we
fetched up the sight of <HI>Nicaria,</HI> wee espyed two <HI>Turkish</HI>
Galleots, who gave us the Chase, and pursued us straight
to a Bay betwixt two Mountaines where wee left the
loaden Boat, and fled to the Rocks, from whence wee
<PB N="97" REF="58"/>
mightily annoyed with huge tumbling stones, the pursu∣ing
<HI>Turks:</HI> But in our flying, the Master was taken, and
other two old men; whom they made captives and slaves:
and also seized upon the Boat, and all their goods: The
number of us that escaped were nine persons.</P>
<P>This Isle <HI>Nicaria,</HI> was anciently called <HI>Doliche,</HI> and
<HI>Ithiosa,</HI> and is somwhat barren: having no Sea-port at all:
It was here, the Poets feigned, that <HI>Icarus</HI> the sonne of
<HI>Dedalus</HI> fell, when as hee tooke flight from <HI>Creta,</HI> with
his borrowed wings, of whom it hath the name; and not
following directly his father <HI>Dedalus,</HI> was here drowned.</P>

<L>So many moe experience may account,</L>
<L>That both above their minds, and means would mount.</L></Q>
<P>Expecting certaine dayes here, in a Village called <HI>La∣phantos,</HI>
for passage to <HI>Sio,</HI> at last I found a Brigandino
bound thither, that was come from the fruitfull Isle of
<HI>Stalimene,</HI> of old <HI>Lemnos.</HI> This Isle of <HI>Stalimene</HI> is in cir∣cuit
90 miles, where in <HI>Hephestia</HI> it's <HI>Metropolis, Vulcan</HI>
was mightily adored,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcans</HI> birth▪</NOTE> who being but a homely brat, was

he became crooked, and went a halting: The sovereigne
minerall against infections, called <HI>Teera Lamnia,</HI> or <HI>Sigil∣lata,</HI>
is digged here: The former name proceedeth from
the Island: The latter is in force, because the earth being
made up in little pellets, is sealed with a <HI>Turkish</HI> Signe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;
and so sold, and dispersed over Christendome. Having
embarked in the aforesaid Brigandine, wee sayled by
the Isle <HI>Samos,</HI> which is opposite to <HI>Caria,</HI> in <HI>Asia minor,</HI>
where the Tyrant <HI>Policrates</HI> lived so fortunate, as hee
<PB N="98" REF="59"/>
had never any mischance all this time, till at last <HI>Orientes</HI>
a <HI>Persian</HI> brought him to a miserable death: Leaving us
an example, that fortune is certaine in nothing but in in∣certainties,
who like a Bee with a sharp sting, hath al∣wayes
some miserie following a long concatenation of
felicities: It is of circuit 160, and of length 40 miles: it
was of old named <HI>Driusa</HI> and <HI>Melanphilo,</HI> in which <HI>Pytha∣gor
as</HI> the Phylosopher and <HI>Lycaon</HI> the excellent Musicio∣ner
were born.</P>
<P>Upon our left hand, and opposite to <HI>Samos</HI> lyeth the Isle
of <HI>Nixia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nixia.</NOTE> formerly <HI>Maxos;</HI> in circuit 68 miles: It was
also called the Isle of <HI>Venus,</HI> and <HI>Dionisia,</HI> and was taken

there is a Wine named by the <HI>Greeks Hyppocon,</HI> that ex∣celleth
in sweetnesse all other Wines except the <HI>Malvasie,</HI>
and it aboundeth in <HI>Cypre</HI> and <HI>Turpentine</HI> trees: There is
here a part of the Isle disinhabited, in regard of a conta∣gious
Lake, that infecteth the ayre both Summer, and
Winter. There is abundance of <HI>Alloes</HI> found here, so
much esteemed by our Apothecaries; the rest of this Isle
shall be touched in the owne place. And neere to <HI>Lango,</HI>
lyeth the Isle <HI>Giara,</HI> now <HI>Stopodia,</HI> it is begirded with
Rocks and desertuous, unto which the <HI>Romans</HI> were wont
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>
to send in banishment such as deserved death: In gene∣rall
of these Isles <HI>Cyclades,</HI> because they are so neere one to
another, and each one in sight of another there are ma∣ny
<HI>Cursares</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Galleots, that still afflict these I∣landers;
Insomuch that the Inhabitants are constrained
to keepe watch day and night, upon the tops of the most
commodious Mountaines, to discover these Pirats; which
they easily discerne from other vessels, both because of
their Sayles and Oares: And whensoever discovered ac∣cording
to the number of cursary Boates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Turkish Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ats.</NOTE> they make as
many fires, which giveth warning to all the Ports to be
on guard: And if the Sea voyagers in passing see no signe
on these Isles, of fire or smoake, then they perfectly know
these Laborinthing Seas, are free from pestilent Raveners.</P>
<P>As we left the Isle <HI>Venico</HI> on our left hand, and entred
in the gulfe betwene <HI>Sio,</HI> and <HI>Eolida,</HI> the firme land is
called <HI>Aeolida,</HI> there fell downe a deadly storme at the
<HI>Grecoe Levante,</HI> or at the North-east, which split our
Mast, carrying sayles and all over-boord: whereupon
every man looked (as it were) with the stamp of death
in his pale visage. The tempest continuing (our Boate
not being able to keep the Seas) we were constrained to
seeke into a creeke, betwixt two Rocks, for safety of our
lives; where, when we entred, there was no likely-hood
of reliefe: for we had shelfie shore, and giving ground
to the Anchors, they came both home.</P>
<P>The sorrowfull Master seeing nothing but shipwrack,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fearfull shipwrack.</NOTE>
tooke the Helme in hand, directing his course to rush up∣on
the face of a low Rock, whereupon the sea most feare∣fully
broke it. As we touched the Mariners contending
who should first leape out, some fell over-board, and
those that got land, were pulled backe by the reciproca∣ting
waves: Neither in all this time durst I once move▪
<PB N="100" REF="60"/>
for they had formerly sworne, if I pressed to escape, be∣fore
the rest were first forth, they would throw me head∣long
into the sea: So being two wayes in danger of death
I patiently offered up my prayers to God.</P>
<P>At our first encounter with the Rocks, (our fore-decks,
and Boates gallery being broke, and a great Lake made)
the reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing waves brought us back from the Shelves a
great way; which the poore Master perceiving, and that
there were seven men drowned, and eleven persons alive,
cryed with a loud voyce: Be of good courage, take up
oares, and row hastily; it may be, before the Barke sinke,
we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to yonder Cave, which then appeared to
our sight: Every man working for his owne deliverance
(as it pleased God) we got the same with good fortune:
for no sooner were we disbarked, and I also left the last
man, but the Boat immediatly sunke. There was nothing
saved but my <HI>Coffino,</HI> which I kept alwayes in my armes:
partly, that it might have brought my dead body to some
creeke, where being found, might have beene by the
<HI>Greekes</HI> buryed; and partly I held it fast also, that saying
my life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A happy deli∣verance from shipwrack.</NOTE> I might save it too; it was made of Reeds and
would not easily sink, notwithstanding of my papers and
linnen I carried into it for the which safetie of my things
the <HI>Greekes</HI> were in admiration. In this Cave, which was
30 paces long, within the mountaine, wee abode three
dayes without either meat or drink, upon the fourth day
at morne, the tempest ceasing, there came Fisher-boates
to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eve us, who found the ten <HI>Greekes</HI> almost famished
for lacke of food; but I in that hunger-starving feare, fed
upon the expectation of my doubtfull reliefe.</P>
<P>True it is, a miserable thing it is for man, to grow an ex∣ample
to others in matters of affliction, yet it is necessa∣ry
that some men should be so: For it pleased God, ha∣ving
<PB N="101" REF="60"/>
shewn a sensible disposition of favour upon mee, in
humbling me to the very pit of extremities, taught me al∣so
by such an unexpected deliverance, both to put my con∣fidence
in his eternall goodnesse, and to know the frailty
of my own selfe, and my ambition, which drave mee often
to such disasters.</P>
<P>The dead men being found on shoare, we buried them;
and I learned at that instant time, there were seventeene
boats cast away on the Coast of this Island, and never a
man saved: in this place the <HI>Greeks</HI> set up a stone Crosse in
the memoriall of such a wofull mischance, and mourned
heavily, fasting and praying. I rejoycing and thanking
God for my safety (leaving them sorrowing for their
friends and goods) tooke journey through the Iland to
<HI>Sio,</HI> for so is the City called, being thirty miles distant:
in my way I past by an old Castle standing on a little hill,
named <HI>Garbos,</HI> now <HI>Helias;</HI> where (as I was informed by
two <HI>Greeks</HI> in my company) the Sepulcher of <HI>Homer</HI> was
yet extant: for this <HI>Sio</HI> is one of the seven Iles and Towns,
that contended for his birth:
<Q><L><HI>Septem urbes certant de stirpe insignis</HI> Homeri.</L>
<L>These Cities seven (I undername) did strive,</L>
<L><HI>Who first brought</HI> Homer <HI>to the world alive.</HI></L>
<L>Smyrna, Rhodos, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, Athenae:</L></Q></P>
<P>The which I willing to see, I entreated my associats
to accompany me thither; where, when we came, we de∣scended
by 16 degrees into a darke Cell; and passing that,
we entred in another foure squared room, in which I saw
an ancient Tombe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Homers</HI> Se∣puleher.</NOTE> whereon were ingraven <HI>Greek</HI> letters,
which we could not understand for their antiquity; but
whether it was his Tombe or not, I doe not know, but
this they related, and yet very likely to have been his Se∣pulcher.</P>

This Isle of <HI>Sio</HI> is divided into two parts, to wit, <HI>Ap∣panomera,</HI>
signifying the higher, or upper parts of it:
The other <HI>Catomerea,</HI> that is, the levell, or lower parts of
the Isle: it was first called <HI>Ethalia:</HI> it aboundeth so in O∣ranges
and Lemmons, that they fill Barrels and Pipes with
the juice thereof, and carry them to <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
which the <HI>Turkes</HI> use at their meate, as wee doe the
Verges. And also called <HI>Pythiosa:</HI> next <HI>Cios, Acts</HI> 20. 15.
And by <HI>Methrodorus, Chio,</HI> of <HI>Chione:</HI> but at this day
<HI>Sio.</HI> Not long ago it was under the <HI>Genoveses,</HI> but now
governed by the <HI>Turkes:</HI> it is of circuite an hundred
miles, and famous for the medicinable Masticke that
groweth there on Trees: I saw many pleasant Gardens in
it, which yield in great plenty, Oranges, Lemmons,
Apples, Peares, Prunes, Figges, Olives, Apricocks,
Dates, <HI>Adams</HI> Apples, excellent Herbs, faire Flowres,
sweet Honey, with store of Cypre and Mulbery-trees,
and exceeding good Silk is made here.</P>
<P>At last I arrived at the Citie of <HI>Sio,</HI> where I was lod∣ged,
and kindly used with an old man, of the <HI>Genovesen</HI>
race, for the space of eight dayes: I found here three Mo∣nasteries
of the order of <HI>Rome,</HI> one of the Jesuits, another
of Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> and the third of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Friers,
being all come from <HI>Genoa;</HI> and because the greatest part
of the Citie is of that stock, and of the Papall See, these
Cloysters have a braver life for good cheere, fat Wines,
and delicate Leachery, than any sort of Friers can else∣where
finde in the World.</P>
<P>The women of the Citie <HI>Sio,</HI> are the most beautifull
Dames,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The faire Dames of <HI>Sio.</HI></NOTE> (or rather Angelicall creatures) of all the <HI>Greeks,</HI>

They are for the most part exceeding proud, and
sumptuous in apparell, and commonly go (even Artificers
wives) in gownes of Sattin and Taffety; yea in Cloth of
Silver and Gold, and are adorned with precious Stones,

with Rings, Chains &amp; Bracelets. Their Husbands are their
Pandors, and when they see any stranger arrive, they will
presently demand of him; if hee would have a Mistris:
and so they make whoores of their owne wives, and are
contented for a little gaine, to weare hornes: such are the

a thousand fire-houses within it, some whereof are
<HI>Greeks,</HI> some <HI>Genoveses,</HI> some <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Moores:</HI>
The Citie it selfe is unwalled, yet a populous and spaci∣ous
place, spred along by the Sea-side, having a goodly
harbour for Galleys and Ships. The chiefe inhabitants
there, are descended of the <HI>Genoveses,</HI> and professe the su∣perstition
of <HI>Rome:</HI> The people where of were once Lords
of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, maintaining a Navy of eighty Ships:
In the end they became successively subiect to the <HI>Ro∣mane</HI>

them and their Ile to the <HI>Iustinianes,</HI> a Noble Family of

Magnificent on <HI>Easter</HI> day 1566, being the same yeare
that our late gracious, and once Soveraigne Lord, King
<HI>Iames</HI> of blessed memory was borne. This Citadal or

the great Duke <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> brother to Queene Mother
of <HI>France,</HI> and our owne Queene <HI>Maries</HI> Uncle, <HI>Anno
1600 August</HI> 7. The manner was thus, The <HI>Genovesen</HI>
seed had sold the Fort unto the Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> where∣upon
hee sent his Galleyes and these Gallants thither:
Where, when arrived in the night scaled the wals, slue
the watches, and unhappily ramforced all the Cannon;
and then entring the Fort put all the <HI>Turkes</HI> to the sword,
and among them, too many Christians: The Galleyes
all this time, being doubtfull how it went, durst not en∣ter
the harbour, but a storme falling downe, they bore up
to an Isolet for ancorage in the <HI>Aeolid</HI> gulfe, and three
miles distant: The next morning, the <HI>Turkish</HI> Bashaw,
the City, and all the Islanders were in armes: The <HI>Flo∣rentines</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The heads of 800 <HI>Floren∣tines</HI> cut off.</NOTE>
being dismissed of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alleys, grew discoura∣ged,
and trying the Canon, which they had spoyled at
their first scallet, it would not be: Meane while, the Ba∣shaw
entred in parley with them, and promised faithfully,
to send them safe to the Galleys if they would render.
Upon the third day they yeelded, and as they issued forth
along the draw-bridge, and the Bashaw set in a Tent to re∣ceive
them as they came in, one by one, he caused strike
off all their heads: And done, there was a Pinacle reared
upon the walles of the Fort with their bare sculs which
stand to this day.</P>
<P>But by your leave, <HI>Ferdinando</HI> in person, the yeare

In our way we touched at <HI>Mytelene,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of Mytelene.</NOTE> an Island of old
called <HI>Isa:</HI> next <HI>Lesbos:</HI> And lastly, <HI>Mytelene,</HI> of <HI>Milet</HI> the

<P>This Isle of <HI>Lesbos</HI> or <HI>Mytelene,</HI> containeth in compasse,
one hundred forty six miles: the East parts are levell and
fruitfull, the West and South parts mountainous and bar∣ren:
The chief Cities are <HI>Mytelene</HI> and <HI>Methimnos:</HI> it was
long under subjection of the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greeke</HI> Empe∣rours,
till <HI>Calo Ioannes, Anno</HI> 1355, gave it in dowry

<P>These Isles <HI>Sporades,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A comparison of Isles.</NOTE> are scattered in the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea,
like as the Isles <HI>Orcades</HI> are in the North Seas of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
but different in climate and fertilitie: for these South Ea∣sterne
Isles in Summer are extream hot, producing gene∣rally
(<HI>Nigroponti</HI> excepted) but a few Wines, Fruits, and
Cornes, scarce sufficient to sustain the Islanders. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese
North Westerne Islands in Sommer, are neither hot nor
cold; having a most wholsome and temperate ayre: and
do yield abundance of Corne, even more then to suffice
the inhabitants; which is yeerly transported to the firme
land, and sold: They have also good store of Cattell, and
good cheape, and the best fishing that the whole Ocean
<PB N="106" REF="63"/>
yieldeth, is upon the Coasts of <HI>Orknay</HI> and <HI>Zetland.</HI></P>
<P>In all these separated parts of the Earth, which of them∣selves

finde strong March-Ale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The plentiful∣nesse of <HI>Orknay</HI> and <HI>Zetland.</HI></NOTE> surpassing fine <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI>
abundance of Geese, Hennes, Pigeons, Partridges,
Moore-fowle, Mutton, Beefe and Termigants, with
an infinite number of Conies, which you may kill with
a Crosse-bow or Harquebuse, every morning forth of
your Chamber window, according to your pleasure in
that pastime, which I have both practised my selfe, and
seen practised by others; for they multiply so exceeding∣ly,
that they dig even under the foundations of dwelling
houses. Such is the will of God to bestow upon severall
places, particular blessings; whereby he demonstrateth to
man the plentiful store-house of his gracious providence,
so many manner of wayes upon earth distributed; all glo∣ry
be to his incomprehensible goodnesse therefore. I have
seldome seene in all my travels, more toward, and tracta∣ble
people (I mean their Gentlemen) and better house∣keepers,
then be these <HI>Orcadians,</HI> and <HI>Zetlanders:</HI> where∣of
in the prime of my adolescencie (by two Voyages a∣mongst
these Northern Isles) I had the full proofe and
experience.</P>
<P>And now certainly, it is a signe of little wisedome,
and greater folly, for a man to answer suddenly to every
light question; so it is as great a shame and stupiditie in
man to keep silence, when he should, and may deserving∣ly
speake; Wherefore damnifying the one, and vilifying
the other, I come forth between both (<HI>Pugno pro Patria</HI>)

<PB N="107" REF="63"/>
blindlings in an absurd description of the World, hath
produced many errors, &amp; manifest untruths to the world.</P>
<P>And these amongst thousands moe, which I justly can
censure to be false; namely, he reporteth the <HI>Orcadians</HI> to
be a cruell and barbarous people, and that the most part
of <HI>Scotland</HI> regarded neither King nor Law: tearming us
also to have monstrous backs, against the execution of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice: and because (saith he) they resemble us somewhat
in visage and speech, the <HI>Scots</HI> are descended of the <HI>Sax∣ons;</HI>
where when the blacke wings of the Eagle spread in
the South, they fled thither, thinking rather to enjoy
penurious liberty, then rich fetters of gold: Moreover,

so venemous also is the Wormwood of his braine,
that hee impugneth <HI>Hector Boetius,</HI> to have mentioned a
rabble of <HI>Scottish</HI> Kings before <HI>Kenneth,</HI> the first Mo∣narch
of all <HI>Scotland;</HI> but were he fast rabled in a rope, I
think his presumptuous and impertinent phrase were wel
recompensed: Yea, further hee dare to write, that if the
Mountains, and unaccessable Woods, had not been more
true to the <HI>Scots,</HI> then their own valour, that Kingdome
had long since been subdued.</P>
<P>Many other introductions flow from his shallow base∣branded
apprehension which I purposely omit: To this
his perverse malignity (without partiall or particular con∣struction)
I generally answere; that for courteous pene∣trating
lenity; industrious tractability; prompt and exqui∣site
ingeniosity; nobly taught, vivacious, &amp; vertuous Gen∣tilitie;
humane, and illustrious generosity; inviolate, and
uncommixed nationall pedigree; Learned, Academicall,

zealous orders in spirituality; so docible a people to Su∣pream

there is no Kingdome or Nation within the com∣passe

<P>Now what a selfe <HI>Losungeous</HI> fellow hath this fustian

service, and unresistable valour of the people, of that never

part I desist, and wil not meddle to preamble through per∣emptory
inferences, on particular Kingdoms, although I
acquittingly can; Howsoever a pertinacious <HI>Buffon</HI> dare,
and falsly will do it:

And farre lesse for Religion, can they be banished, or de∣prived

There being a free Liberty of Conscience, for all kinds of

<P>In <HI>Salonica</HI> I found a <HI>Germo,</HI> bound for <HI>Tenedos,</HI> in
which I imbarked: As we sayled along the <HI>Thessalonian</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I saw the two topped hill <HI>Pernassus,</HI> which is of a

<L>Through thickest clouds, <HI>Pernassus</HI> bends his hight,</L>
<L>Whose double tops, do kisse the Stars so bright.</L></Q>
<P>Here it was said the nine <HI>Muses</HI> haunted: but as for the
Fountain <HI>Helicon,</HI> I leave that to be searched, and seen by
the imagination of Poets; for if it had beene objected to
my sight, like an insatiable Drunkard, I should have drunk
up the streams of Poësie, to have enlarged my dry poeti∣call
Sun scorch'd vein.</P>
<P>The Mountaine it selfe is somewhat steepe and sterile,
especially the two tops, the one whereof is dry, and
sandy, signifying that Poets are alwayes poore, and nee∣die:
The other top is barren, and rockie, resembling the
ingratitude of wretched, and niggardly Patrons: the vale
between the tops is pleasant, and profitable, denoting
the fruitfull, and delightfull soile, which painfull Poets,
the <HI>Muses,</HI> Plow-men, so industriously manure. A little
more Eastward, as we fetcht up the coast of <HI>Achaia,</HI> the
Master of the Vessell shewed mee a ruinous Village, and
Castle; where hee said the admired Citie of <HI>Thebes</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thebes.</NOTE> had
been. Whose former glory, who can truly write of! for
as the earth, when shee is disrobed of her budding and
fructifying trees, and of her amiable verdure, which is
her onely grace and garment royall, is like a naked table
wherein nothing is painted: even so is <HI>Thebes</HI> and her past
Triumph defac'd, and bereft of her lusty and young
Gentlemen, as if the spring-tide had been taken from the
yeare: But what shall I say to know the cause of such
like things, they are so secret and mysticall; being the
most remote objects, to which our understanding may
aspire, that wee may easily be deceived, by disguised and
<PB N="120" REF="70"/>
pretended reasons; whilst we seek for the true and essenti∣all
causes: for to report things that are done is easie, be∣cause
the eie and the tongue may dispatch it, but to dis∣cover
and unfold the causes of things, requireth braine,
soul, and the best progresse of Nature. And as there is no
evill without excuse, nor no pretence without some co∣lour
of reason, nor wiles wanting to malicious and wrang∣ling
wits; Even so, was there occasion sought for, what
from <HI>Athens,</HI> and what from <HI>Greece,</HI> whereby the peace
and happinesse of <HI>Thebes</HI> might be dissolved, and discord
raised to the last ruines of her desolation.</P>
<P>This <HI>Achaia</HI> is by some ignorant Geographers placed
in the middle between <HI>Epire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Geographicall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrours.</NOTE> <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and <HI>Peloponesus:</HI>

falsly named <HI>Migdonia,</HI> which is a Province, that lyeth
North from <HI>Thracia,</HI> East from <HI>Macedon,</HI> and South from
<HI>Misia,</HI> having no affinitie with the Sea: The chiefe Cities
in <HI>Achaia,</HI> are <HI>Neapolis, Appollonia,</HI> and <HI>Nicalidi,</HI> where
the famous Philosopher <HI>Aristotle</HI> was born. Here is a
huge and high Hill <HI>Athos,</HI> containing in circuit 70 miles,
and as some affirme three days jonrney long, whose sha∣dow
was absurdly said to have extended to <HI>Lemnos,</HI> an
Island lying neer the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Achaia</HI> was formerly called <HI>Aylaida,</HI> but now by the
<HI>Turks Levienda: Athos</HI> in <HI>Greeke</HI> is called <HI>Agros aeros,</HI> to
wit, a holy Mountain; the top of it is half a days journey
broad, and 14 <HI>Italian</HI> miles high. There are 20 Monaste∣ries
upon it of <HI>Greekish Colieres,</HI> a laborious kinde of silly
Friers, and kinde to strangers: The chiefest of which
Cloisters, are called <HI>Victopodos,</HI> and <HI>Agios laura,</HI> being all of
them strongly walled and fencible.</P>

Upon the third day from <HI>Salonica,</HI> wee arrived in the

which is a gallant place, having a Castle, and a faire Haven
for all sorts of Vessels: it produceth good store of Wines,

and a <HI>Greek</HI> to be our Interpreter. Where when wee lan∣ded,
we saw here and there many relicks of old walls, as
wee travelled through these famous bounds. And as wee
were advanced toward the East part of <HI>Troy,</HI> our <HI>Greek</HI>
brought us to many Tombs, which were mighty ruinous,
and pointed us particularly to the Tombs of <HI>Hector,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tombes of <HI>Trojans.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ajax,

their particular names, &amp; nomination of them, I suspend,
neither could I believe my Interpreter, sith it is more then

<P>Leaving the fields of noble <HI>Ilium,</HI> we crossed the River
of <HI>Simois,</HI> &amp; dined at a Village named <HI>Extetash:</HI> I remem∣ber,
in discharging our covenant with the <HI>Ianizary,</HI> who
<PB N="126" REF="73"/>
was not contented with the former condition, the <HI>French</HI>
men making obstacle to pay that which I had given the
wrathfull <HI>Ianizary</HI> belaboured them both with a cudgell,
till the blood sprung from their heads, and compelled
them to double his wages. This is one true note to a
Traveller (whereof I had the full experience afterward)
that if hee cannot make his owne part good, hee must al∣wayes
at the first motion content these Rascals; otherwise
hee will be constrained; doubtlesse, with stroakes, to pay
twice as much: for they make no account of conscience,
nor ruled by the Law of compassion, neither regard they
a Christian more than a Dog: but whatsoever extortion
or injury they use against him, hee must be <HI>French-</HI>like
contented, bowing his head, and making a counterfeit
shew of thanks, and happy too oftentimes, if so hee
escape.</P>
<P>Hence we arrived at the Castles, called of old <HI>Sestos,</HI> and
<HI>Abydos</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydos.</HI></NOTE> in a small Frigot, which are two Fortresses op∣posite
to other: <HI>Sestos</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> where <HI>Thracia</HI> beginneth;
and <HI>Abidos</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> where <HI>Bythinia</HI> likewise commenceth,
being a short mile distant, and both of them foure leagues
from <HI>Troy.</HI> They stand at the beginning of <HI>Hellespont,</HI> and
were also cognominate the Castles of <HI>Hero</HI> and <HI>Leander,</HI>
which were erected in a commemoration of their admi∣rable
fidelity in love.</P>
<Q><L>Which curling tops, <HI>Leander</HI> cut in two,</L>
<L>And through proud billows, made his passage go;</L>
<L>To court his Mistris: O <HI>Hero</HI> the fair!</L>
<L>Whom <HI>Hellespon</HI> to stop, was forc'd to dare:</L>
<L>Sweet was their sight to other, short their stay,</L>
<L>For still <HI>Leander,</HI> was recald by day.</L>
<L>At last stern <HI>Ae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,</HI> puft on <HI>Neptunes</HI> pride,</L>

<L><PB N="127" REF="73"/>
He swims, and sinks, and in that glutting down,</L>
<L>The angry Fates, did kinde <HI>Leander</HI> drown:</L>
<L>Of which when <HI>Hero</HI> heard, judge you her part,</L>
<L>She smote her self, and rent in two her heart.</L></Q>
<P>But now they are commonly called the Castles of <HI>Galli∣poly,</HI>
yea, or rather the strength of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> between
which no Ships may enter, without knowledge of the
Captains, and are by them strictly and warily searched, lest
the Christians should carry in Men, Munition, or Furni∣ture
of Armes, for they stand in feare of surprising the
Town: And at their return they must stay three days, be∣fore
they are permitted to go through, because of tran∣sporting
away any Christian slaves, or if they have com∣mitted
any offence in the Citie, the knowledge there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f
may come in that time.</P>
<P>At that same instant of my abode at <HI>Abidos,</HI> there
were fourescore Christian Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christian slaves fled from <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI></NOTE> who having cut their
Captaines throat, with the rest of the <HI>Turks,</HI> run away
from <HI>Constantinople</HI> with the Galley. And passing here
the second day thereafter at midnight, were discovered
by the Watch of both Castles, where the Cannon never
left thundring for two houres; yet they escaped with small
hurt, and at last arrived in the Road of <HI>Zante;</HI> desiring
landing, and succour, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir victuals were done: vi∣ctuals
they sent them, but the Governour would not suffer
them to come on Land. In end, the Sea growing some∣what
boysterous, the slaves for an excuse cut their Cables,
and runne the Galley a shoare: Upon this they were
entertained in service, but the Providitor caused to
burne the Galley, fearing least the <HI>Turks</HI> should thereby
forge some quarrell. The yeare following, an other
Galley attempted the same, but the poore slaves having
past the Castles, had been so wounded and killed with
<PB N="128" REF="74"/>
the great shot, and the Galley ready to sinke, they were
enforced to runne a shoare, where the next morning be∣ing
apprehended, they were miserably put to death. Be∣twixt
the Castles and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> is about fortie
leagues. Over this straight <HI>Xerxes</HI> did make a bridge of
Boats to passe into <HI>Greece,</HI> which when a sudden tempest
had shrewdly battered, hee caused the Sea to be beaten
with 300 stripes.</P>
<P>And at that same time <HI>Xerxes</HI> passing over the <HI>Helle∣spont,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sorrow of <HI>Xerxes.</HI></NOTE>
and seeing all the Sea clad with his Army, his Hor∣ses,
Chariots, and Ships, the teares burst from his eyes:
and being demanded the cause of his griefe? answered,
O, said hee, <HI>I weep because within a hundred yeares, all this
great and glorious sight, shall be dissolved to nothing; and
neither man, nor beast shall be alive, nor Chariot, nor En∣gine
of War, but shall be turn'd to dust; and so I sorrow to
see the short mortality of Nature.</HI> Indeed it was a worthy
saying, from such a Heathenish Monarch, who saw no
further, than the present misery of this life.</P>
<P>Here I left the two <HI>French</HI> men with a <HI>Greeke</HI> Barber,
and imbarked for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in a <HI>Turkish</HI> Frigate.
The first place of any note I saw, within these narrow
Seas, was the ancient Citie of <HI>Gallipolis,</HI> the second
seat of <HI>Thracia,</HI> which was first builded by <HI>Cajus Cali∣gula,</HI>
and somtimes had beene inhabited by the <HI>Gaules:</HI>
It was the first Towne in <HI>Europe,</HI> that the <HI>Turks</HI> conque∣red;
and was taken by <HI>Solyman</HI> sonne to <HI>Orchanes, Anno</HI>
1438.</P>
<P>North from <HI>Thracia</HI> lyeth the Province of <HI>Bulgaria,</HI>
commonly <HI>Volgaria,</HI> and was called so of certaine peo∣ple.
that came from a Country, neere to the River <HI>Volgo</HI>
in <HI>Russia,</HI> about the yeare 666. It lyeth betweene <HI>Servia,
Thracia,</HI> and <HI>Danubio,</HI> and by the Ancients, it was
<PB N="129" REF="74"/>
thought to be the lower <HI>Misia</HI> (but more iustly) the Re∣gion
of <HI>Dacia.</HI> The chife Town is <HI>Sophia,</HI> which some
hold to be that Towne, which <HI>Ptolomeus</HI> named <HI>Te∣bisca.</HI></P>
<P>Here in <HI>Thracia</HI> lived the Tyrant <HI>Polymnestor,</HI> who
treacherously murthered <HI>Polidorus</HI> a yonger sonne of <HI>Pri∣amus:</HI>
for which fact <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uba,</HI> the young Princes mother
scratched him to death. Here also reigned the wortthy
King <HI>Cotis,</HI> whom I propose as a paterne of rare temper
in mastring and preventing passion: To whom when a
neighbour Prince had sent him an exquisite present of
accurately wrought glasse; he (having dispatched the
messenger with all due complements and gratitude of
Maiestie) broke them all to pieces: lest by mishap, any
of his Servants doing the like, might stir or move him
to an intemperate choler.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greekes</HI> here, and generally through all <HI>Greece,</HI>
beare as much reverence and respect to Mount <HI>Athos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount <HI>Athos.</HI></NOTE>
as the Papists beare to <HI>Rome:</HI> All of which Religious

<P>As wee sayled betweene <HI>Thracia</HI> and <HI>Bithinia,</HI> a learned

the famous City of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> in <HI>Bethinia</HI> on our right

World, the great City of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> which in∣deed
yieldeth such an outward splendour to the amazed
beholder, of goodly Churches, stately Towers, gallant
Steeples, and other such things, whereof now the world
make so great accompt, that the whole earth cannot e∣quall
it. Beholding these delectable objects, we entred
in the channell of <HI>Bosphorus,</HI> which divideth <HI>Perah</HI> from
<HI>Constantinople.</HI> And arriving at <HI>Tapanau,</HI> where all the
munition of the great <HI>Turke</HI> lyeth, I adressed my selfe to a

<P>But (by your leave) I had a hard welcome in my land∣ing,
for bidding farewell to the <HI>Turkes,</HI> who had kindly
used me three dayes, in our passage from the Castles, the
Master of the boate saying <HI>adio Christiano:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsh arri∣vall.</NOTE> There were

the Name of Jesus, and throwing me to the ground, beate
me most cruelly: And if it had not beene for my friendly
<HI>Turkes,</HI> who leaped out of their boat and relieved mee,
I had doubtlesse there perished. The other Infidels stan∣ding

mee, I entred a <HI>Greek</HI> lodging, where I was kindly recei∣ved,
and much eased of my blows, because they caused
to oint them with divers Oiles, and refreshed mee also
with their best enttrtainment, <HI>gratis,</HI> because I had suffe∣red
so much for Christs sake, and would receive no re∣compence
againe. The day following, I went to salute,
and doe my duty to the right Worshipfull Sir <HI>Thomas

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Onstantinople</HI> is the Metropolitan of <HI>Thra∣cia,</HI>
so called of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour,
who first enlarged the same: It was called

Stambolda,</HI> which signifieth in their lan∣guage,
a large City: It was also called <HI>E∣thuse,</HI>
&amp; by the <HI>Greeks Stymbolis.</HI> This City (according to
ancient Authors) was first founded by the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI>
who were conducted from <HI>Lacedemon,</HI> by one <HI>Pansanias,</HI> a∣bout
the year of the World 3294, which after their consul∣tation
with <HI>Apollo,</HI> where they should settle their abode &amp;
dwelling place, they came to <HI>Bythinia,</HI> and builded a Citie
which was called <HI>Chalcedon.</HI> But the commodity of fish∣ing
falling out contrary to their expectation, in respect
that the fishes were afraid of the white banks of the City;
the Captain <HI>Pausanias</HI> left that place, and builded <HI>Byzan∣tium</HI>

<HI>Pliny, Iustine,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> it was sirnamed <HI>Vrbs Illustrissi∣ma,</HI>
because it is repleat with al the blessings, earth can give

<P><HI>Zonoras</HI> reporteth that the <HI>Athenians,</HI> in an ambitious
and insatiable desire of Sovereignty, wonne it from the
<HI>Lacedemonians:</HI> They thus being vanquished, suborned
<HI>Severus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, to besiege the same: But
the Citie <HI>Byzantium</HI> being strongly fortified with walls,
the <HI>Romans</HI> could not take it in, untill extream famine
constrained them to yield, after three yeares siege: and
<HI>Severus</HI> to satisfie his cruelty, put all to the sword; that
<PB N="133" REF="76"/>
were within, and razed the wals, giving it in possession
to the neighbouring <HI>Perinthians.</HI> This Citie thus remai∣ned
in calamitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Byzanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> re-edified by <HI>Constantine.</HI></NOTE> till <HI>Constantine</HI> (resigning the Citie of
<HI>Rome,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Italy</HI> to the Popish inheritance
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishops) re-edified the same, and translated
his Imperiall Seat in the East, and reduced all the Empire
of <HI>Greece,</HI> to a unite tranquilitie, with immortall reputa∣tion,
which the <HI>Parthians</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> had so miserably
disquieted.</P>
<P>But these disorders at length reformed by the severe
administration of Justice, for the which, and other wor∣thy
respects, the said <HI>Constantine</HI> sonne of Saint <HI>Helen,</HI>
and Emperour of <HI>Rome</HI> (which afterward the Pope u∣surped)
was sirnamed the Great. He first in his plantation
called this Citie new <HI>Rome;</HI> but when he beheld the flou∣rishing,
and multiplying of all things in it, and because of
the commodious situation thereof, he called it <HI>Constan∣tinopolis,</HI>
after his owne name. This Emperour lived
there many prosperous years, in most happy estate: like∣wise
many of his Successours did, untill such time, that
<HI>Mahomet</HI> the second of that name, and Emperour of the
<HI>Turks;</HI> living in a discontented humour, to behold the
great and glorious Dominions of Christians; especially
this famous Citie, that so flourished in his eies, by mo∣mentall
circumstances, collected his cruell intentions, to
the full height of ambition; whereby hee might abolish
the very name of Christianity, and also puft up with a
presumptuous desire, to enlarge his Empire, went with a
marvellous power, both by Sea and Land, unto this mag∣nificent
Mansion.</P>
<P>The issue whereof was such, that after divers batteries
and assaults, the irreligious Infidels broke downe the
walls, and entred the City, which breach was about forty
<PB N="134" REF="77"/>
paces long, as by the new colour being built up again, is
easily knowne from the old walls, where when they en∣tered,
they made a wonderfull massacre of poor afflicted
Christians, without sparing any of the <HI>Roman</HI> kinde, ei∣ther
male or female. In the mercilesse fury of these infer∣nall
Imps, the Emperour <HI>Constantine</HI> was killed, whose
head being cut off, was carried upon the point of a Lance
through all the City, and Campe of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> to the
great disgrace and ignominy of Christianity. His Em∣presse,
Daughters, and other Ladies, after they were abu∣sed
in their bodies, were put to death in a most cruell and
terrible manner.</P>
<P>By this overthrow of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> this <HI>Mahomet</HI>
took twelve Kingdoms, and two hundred Cities from
the Christians, which is a lamentable losse, of such an il∣lustrious
Empire. Thus was that Imperiall Citie lost, in
the yeare 1453, <HI>May</HI> 29, when it had remained under
the government of Christians, 1198 yeares. It is now the
chief abode of the great <HI>Turk Sultan Achmet,</HI> the fifteenth
Grand <HI>Cham,</HI> of the line of <HI>Ottoman,</HI> who was then about
twenty three years of age; whose sonne <HI>Osman</HI> since, and
after his death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foure Empe∣rours one af∣ter another distressed.</NOTE> was murdered by the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> being 14
years of age, after his return to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> from <HI>Po∣dolia</HI>
in <HI>Poland:</HI> And in his place, his Uncle <HI>Mustapha</HI>
made Emperour, whose weaknesse and unworthinesse be∣ing
eft-soons discovered, he was displaced, and <HI>Amurath
Osmans</HI> brother made <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> who presently raign∣eth;
and not without great feare of his <HI>Ianizaries</HI> and
<HI>Timariots,</HI> who twice in three yeeres have lately made in∣surrection
against him. This Emperour <HI>Achmet,</HI> who was
alive when I was there, was more given to Venery, then
Martiality, which gave a greater advantage to the <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
in their defensive wars.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="77"/>
Concerning the Empire, wee may observe some fatall
contrarieties in one and the same name: For <HI>Philip</HI> the Fa∣ther
of <HI>Alexander,</HI> laid the first foundation of the <HI>Macedo∣nian</HI>
Monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contrarieties of fortune.</NOTE> and <HI>Philip</HI> the Father of <HI>Perseus</HI> ruined it.
So was this Town built by a <HI>Constantine</HI> the sonne of <HI>He∣lena,</HI>
a <HI>Gregory</HI> being Patriarch, and was lost by a <HI>Constan∣tine,</HI>
the sonne of a <HI>Helena,</HI> a <HI>Gregory</HI> being also Patriarch.
The <HI>Turks</HI> have a Prophesie, that as it was wonne by a
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> so it shall be lost by a <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The form, or situation of this Citie, is like unto a Tri∣angle,
the South part whereof, and the East part, are invi∣roned
with <HI>Hellespontus,</HI> and <HI>Bosporus Thraicus;</HI> and the
North part adjoyning to the firme land. It is in compasse
about the walls, esteemed to be 18 miles: in one of these
triangled points, being the Southeast part, and at the joy∣ning
of <HI>Bosphore</HI> and <HI>Hellespont,</HI> standeth the Palace of
the Great <HI>Turke,</HI> called <HI>Seralia</HI> and the Forrest wherein
he hunteth; which is two miles in length.</P>
<P>The speciall object of Antiquitie, I saw within this Ci∣ty,
was the incomparable Church of Saint <HI>Sophia,</HI> whose
ornaments and hallowed Vessels, were innumerable, in the
time of <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour, who first builded it; but
now converted to a <HI>Mosque,</HI> and consecrated to <HI>Mahomet,</HI>
after a diabolicall manner.</P>
<P>I saw also the famous <HI>Hyppodrome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyppodrome.</NOTE> and the Theater
whereon the people stood, when the Emperours used to
run their Horses, and make their Princely shows on so∣lemne
dayes, which is now altogether decaid: There is a
great Columne in that same place, in the which all these
things memorable, that have bin done in this <HI>Hyppodrome,</HI>
are superficially carved.</P>
<P>Upon the West corner of the City, there is a strong,
Fortresse, fortified with seven great Towers, and well
<PB N="136" REF="78"/>
furnished with Munition, called by <HI>Turks, Iadileke:</HI> In
this Prison, are Bassawes, and Subbassawes imprisoned,
and also great men of Christians, if any offence be com∣mitted.
Their place of Exchange is called <HI>Bezastan,</HI>
wherein all sorts of commodities are to be sold; as Sat∣tins,
Silkes, Velvets, Cloth of Silver and Gold, and the
most exquisitely wrought Hand-kerchiefes, that can be
found in the world; with infinite other commodities, the
relation of which would be tedious.</P>
<P>I have seene men and women as usually sold here in
Markets, as Horses and other beasts are with us: The
most part of which are <HI>Hungarians, Transilvaniaus, Ca∣rindians,
Istrians,</HI> and <HI>Dalmatian</HI> Captives, and of other
places besides, which they can overcome. Whom, if no
compassionable Christian will buy, or relieve; then must
they either turne <HI>Turke,</HI> or be addicted to perpetuall sla∣very.
Here I remember of a charitable deed, done for a
sinfull end, and thus it was; A Ship of <HI>Marseilles,</HI> called
the great <HI>Dolphin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A French Palliard.</NOTE> lying here forty dayes at the <HI>Galata,</HI>
the Master Gunner, named <HI>Monsieur Nerack,</HI> and I fal∣ling
in familiar acquaintance, upon a time he told me se∣cretly
that he would gladly for Conscience and Merits
sake, redeeme some poore Christian slave from <HI>Turkish</HI>
Captivity. To the which, I applauded his advice, and
told him the next Friday following I would assist him to
so worthy an action: Friday comes, and he and I went for
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> where the Market of the slaves being rea∣dy
we spent two houres in viewing and reviewing five
hundred Males and Females. At last I pointed him to
have bought an old man or woman, but his minde was
contrary set, shewing me that he would buy some virgin,
or young widdow, to save their bodies unde floured with
Infidels. The price of a virgin was too deare for him, be∣ing
<PB N="137" REF="78"/>
a hundred Duckets, and widdows were farre under,
and at an easier rate: When wee did visit and search them
that wee were mindfull to buy, they were strip'd stark na∣ked
before our eyes, where the sweetest face, the youngest
age, and whitest skin was in greatest value and request:
The <HI>Iews</HI> sold them, for they had bought them from the
<HI>Turkes::</HI> At last we fell upon a <HI>Dalmatian</HI> widdow, whose
pitifull looks, and sprinkling teares strook my soule al∣most
to death for compassion: whereupon I grew earnest
for her reliefe, and hee yielding to my advice, shee is
bought and delivered unto him, the man being 60 yeares
of age, and her price 36 Duckets. We leave the Market
and came over again to <HI>Galata,</HI> where hee and I tooke a
Chamber for her, and leaving them there, the next mor∣ning
I returned early, suspecting greatly the dissembling
devotion of the Gunner to be nought but luxurious lust,
and so it proved: I knocked at the Chamber doore, that
hee had newly locked, and taken the key with him to the
ship, for he had tarried with her all that night; and she an∣swering
me with teares, told mee all the manner of his u∣sage,
wishing her selfe to be again in her former captivity:
whereupon I went a shipboord to him, and in my griefe I
swore, that if hee abused her any more after that manner,
and not returned to her distresse, her Christian liberty; I
would first make it knowne to his Master the Captaine of
the Ship, and then to the <HI>French</HI> Ambassadour: for hee
was mindfull also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dalma∣tian Widdow relieved.</NOTE> his lust being satisfied to have sold her
over againe to some other: At which threatning the old
<HI>Pallyard</HI> became so fearfull, that he entred in a reasonable
condition with mee, and the Ship departing thence sixe
dayes there after, he freely resigned to me her life, her li∣berty
and freedome: which being done, and he gone, un∣der
my hand before divers <HI>Greekes,</HI> I subscribed her liber∣tie,
<PB N="138" REF="79"/>
and hired her in the same Taverne for a yeare, taking
nothing from her, for as little had she to give me, except
many blessings and thankefull prayers: This <HI>French</HI> Gun∣ner
was a Papist and here you may behold the dregs of
his devotion, and what seven nights leachery cost him,
you may cast up the reckoning of 36 Duckets.</P>
<P>In <HI>Constantinople</HI> there have happened many fearefull

of the rarest Monuments there, and the beauty of infinite
Palaces; as <HI>Zonoras</HI> the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Historiogra∣pher

It is subject also to divers Earth-quakes, which
have often subverted the Towers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pestilence and Earth-quakes.</NOTE> Houses, Churches, and
Walles of the City to the ground. Especially in the yeare
1509 in the raigne of <HI>Bajazeth,</HI> the ninth Emperour of
the <HI>Turkes,</HI> in which time, more then 13000. persons
were all smothered and dead, and laid up in heapes unbu∣ried.
And commonly every third yeare, the pestilence is
exceeding great in that City, and after such an odious
manner; that those who are infected (before they die)
have the halfe of their one side rot, and fall away: so
that you may easily discerne the whole intrailes of their
bowels. It is not licentiated here, nor else where in all
<HI>Turkie,</HI> that any Christian should enter in their <HI>Moskies,</HI>
or Churches, without the conduct of a <HI>Ianizary</HI> the try∣all
whereof I had when I viewed that glorious and great
Church of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> once the beauty and ornament
of all <HI>Europe;</HI> and is now the chiefe place, to which the

Truly I may say of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as I said once of the
World, in the <HI>Lamentado</HI> of my second Pilgrimage;
<Q><L>A painted Whoore, the mask of deadly sin,</L>
<L>Sweet, fair without, and stinking foul within.</L></Q></P>
<P>For indeed outwardly it hath the fairest shew, and in∣wardly
in the streets being narrow, and most part cove∣red,
the filthiest and deformed buildings in the world; the
reason of its beauty, is, because being situate on moderate
prospective heights, the universall tectures, a far off, yield
a delectable shew, the covertures being erected like the
backe of a Coach after the <HI>Italian</HI> fashion with gutterd
tile. But being entred within, there is nothing but a stink∣ing
deformity, and a lothsome contrived place; without
either internall domestick furniture, or externall decore∣ments
of Fabricks palatiatly extended. Notwithstanding
that for its situation, the delicious wines and fruits, the
temperate climate, the fertile circumjacent fields, and for
the Sea <HI>Hellespont,</HI> and pleasant <HI>Asia</HI> on the other side: it
may truly be called the Paradice of the earth.</P>
<P><HI>Perah</HI> is over against <HI>Constantinople,</HI> called of old, <HI>Cor∣nubizantii;</HI>
but by the <HI>Turkes, Galata,</HI> being both a quar∣ter
of a mile distant, and the <HI>Thraick Bosphore</HI> dividing the
two. It is the place at which Christian Ships touch, and
where the Ambassadours of Christendome lie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Christi∣an Ambassa∣dours at <HI>Pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ab.</HI></NOTE> The num∣ber
of the Christian Ambassadours that then lay there, and

lastly, the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadours, with whom often for
discourses I was familiar, although with Noble Sir <HI>Thomas
Glover</HI> I was still domestick for twelve weeks, whose Se∣cretary
for that time was my Countriman, Mr. <HI>Iames Rol∣lock,</HI>
who now, as I take it, is resident in <HI>Striveling,</HI> he was
the last <HI>Scotsman</HI> I saw till my returne to <HI>Malta,</HI> after my
departure from <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="80"/>
From thence I went to the black Sea: but commonly
<HI>Mare Euxinum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pompeys</HI> Pillar.</NOTE> where I saw <HI>Pompeyes</HI> Pillar of Marble,
standing neer the shoare, upon a rocky Island: and not far
from thence, is a Lanthorne higher then any Steeple,
whereon there is a pan full of liquour, that burneth eve∣ry
night to give warning unto ships how neer they come
the shore; It is not much unlike these Lanthornes of <HI>Li∣gorne</HI>
and <HI>Genua.</HI> The water of this Sea is never a whit
blacker then other Seas: but it is called blacke, in respect
of the dangerous events in darke and tempestuous nights,
which happen there; and because of the Rockes and
Sands which lye a great way from the main shore upon
which many vessels many times are cast away. The blacke
Sea is not farre from <HI>Galata,</HI> for I both went and returned
in one day, being forty miles out, and in: For I went by
boate, and not by land, through the pleasant <HI>Euripus,</HI>
that runneth between the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea and <HI>Hellespont:</HI>
And by the way, I cannot but regrate the great losse Sir
<HI>Thomas Glover</HI> received by the Duke of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> who
chargeably entertained him two yeares in his house, and
furnished him with great monies, and other necessaries fit
for his eminency: This Duke or Prince of <HI>Bugdonia</HI> was
derpaved of his Principalities by <HI>Achmet,</HI> and fled hither
to the Christian Ambassadours for reliefe: To whom
when all the rest had refus'd acceptance, only Noble Sir
<HI>Thomas</HI> received him, maintaining him, and seriously
wrought with the Grand Signior and his Counsell, to
have had him restored againe to his Lands, but could not
prevaile.</P>
<P>In the end, Sir <HI>Thomas Glovers</HI> five yeares time of Am∣bassadry
being expired, and the Duke hearing privately
that Sir <HI>Paul Pinder</HI> was to come in his place, as indeed
he came too soone: this <HI>Moldavian</HI> Prince, stole earely a∣way
<PB N="141" REF="80"/>
in the morning over to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and long ere
midday turn'd <HI>Turke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Moldavia</HI> turn'd <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE> and was circumcised, contenting
himselfe onely for all his great Dukedome with a Palace
and a yearely pension of twelve thousand Chickens of
Gold during his life. Which, when we heard, the Am∣bassadour,
and we were all amazed and discontented: He
was indebted to the Ambassadour above 15 thousand
Chickens of Gold, yet ere my leaving <HI>Galata,</HI> I went twice
over with Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> and saw him and found him atten∣ded
with a number of <HI>Turkes,</HI> who when he saw me, took
me kindly by the hand, for wee had bin two moneths fa∣miliar
in the Ambassadors house before.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Ambassador within halfe a yeare, recove∣red
the halfe of his moneys, the other halfe he was forced
to forgoe for divers importunate respects. Nay, I must
say one thing more of this Knight, hee relieved more
slaves from the Galleys, payd their ransomes, and sent
them home freely to their Christian stations, and kept a
better house, than any Ambassadour did, that ever lay at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> or ever shall to the worlds end</P>
<P>His mother was a <HI>Polonian,</HI> who comming from <HI>Dan∣sick</HI>
to <HI>London,</HI> was delivered of him upon the Sea: Af∣terward
he was brought up at <HI>Constantinople</HI> from a boy,
and spoke, and wrot the <HI>Slavonian</HI> Tongue perfectly: And
thence returning for <HI>London,</HI> he was the first Ambassadour
King <HI>Iames,</HI> of blessed Memory, sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
after his comming to the Crowne of <HI>England:</HI> And thus
much for this worthy and ever renowned Knight, whose
prayse and fame I cannot too much celebrate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkes</HI> have no Bels in their Churches, neither the
use of a clocke, nor numbring of houres, but they have
high round Steeples, for they contrafact, and contradict
all the formes of Christians: when they goe to pray, they
<PB N="142" REF="81"/>
are all called together by the voice of crying men, who go
upon the bartizings of their Steeples, shouting and crying
with a shrill voice: <HI>Lailla, Eillalla,</HI> Mahomet <HI>Rezul allah,</HI>
that is: <HI>God is a great God, and</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet,
or otherwise there is but one God.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and all other places of <HI>Turkie,</HI> I ever
saw three Sabbaths together, in one Weeke: The Friday
for the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Saturday for <HI>Iews,</HI> and the Sunday
for <HI>Christians:</HI> but the <HI>Turks</HI> Sabbath is worst kept of all:
for they will not spare to doe any labour on their Holy
Day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Times of <HI>Turkish</HI> pray∣ers.</NOTE> They have meetings at their publick Prayers, every
day five s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verall times: the first is, before the rising of the
Sun: The second is, a little before midday: The third is,
at three of the clock in the afternoon: The fourth is, at
the Sun-setting, Summer and Winter: Fifthly, the last
houre of Prayer, is alwayes two or three houres within
night. Many of them will watch till that time, and not
sleep; and others sleeping, will awake at the voice of the
Cryer, and go to Church.</P>
<P>In signe of reverence, and in a superstitious devotion
before they go into their <HI>Mosquees,</HI> they wash themselves
in a <HI>Lavotoio,</HI> beginning at the privy members, next their
mouthes, faces, feet and hands: And entring, they in∣cline
their heads downwards to the earth; and falling on
their knees, doe kisse the ground three times. Then the
<HI>Talasumany,</HI> which is the chiefe Priest, mounteth upon
a high stone▪ where hee maketh many Orations to <HI>Maho∣met:</HI>
and the rest to assist him, continue a long time sha∣king
their heads, as though they were out of all their
naturall understanding, repeating oft this word <HI>Haylamo,
Haylamo;</HI> and after that will sigh grievously, saying, <HI>Hou∣pek.</HI>
And somtimes will abruptly sing the Psalmes of <HI>Da∣vid</HI>
in the <HI>Arabick</HI> tongue, but to no sense, nor veritie of
<PB N="143" REF="81"/>
the Scriptures. And at their devotion, they will not to∣lerate
any women in their company, lest they should with∣draw
their minds and affections from their present zeale:
But the men observe their turns and times, and the women
theirs, going always when they goe, either of them alone
to their devotion: The like custome, but not after the
same manner have I seen observed among the Protestants
in <HI>Transilvania, Hungaria, Moravia, Bohemia,</HI> and <HI>Silesia;</HI>
who when they come to Church on the Sabbath day,
there is a Taffata Curtaine drawne from the pulpit to the
Church wall over against it: The men sitting on the right
hand of the preacher, the women on the left; whose eyes
and faces cannot see other during Divine Service, save on∣ly
the Minister that over-toppeth both sides; and truly me
thought it was a very modest, and necessary observation.
The <HI>Turks</HI> are generally circumcised after the manner of
the <HI>Iews,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> are circumci∣sed.</NOTE> but not after eight dayes, but after eight yeares.
The Church-men are called <HI>Hadach Casseis,</HI> or <HI>Darvises,</HI>
who weare on their heads green <HI>Shashes,</HI> to make distin∣ction
between them and others: for they are accounted to
be of <HI>Mahomets</HI> Kindred.</P>
<P>They hold all mad men in great reverence, as Prophets
or Saints, and if they intend any far journy, private purpo∣ses,
or otherwise, before they go to battaile, they come to
crave counsell of these <HI>Santones,</HI> to know if they shall pro∣sper,
or not, in their attempts. And whatsoever answer
these Bedlem prophets give, it is holden to be so credible,
as if an Oracle had spoken it. The <HI>Turkish</HI> priests are for
the most part <HI>Moores,</HI> whom they account to be a base
people in respect of themselves, calling them <HI>Totseks:</HI>
Their principall Church Governour is called <HI>Mufti,</HI>
Whose definitive sentence in Law or Religion is pene∣trable,
and absolutely valiant: Neither abaseth hee him∣selfe
<PB N="144" REF="82"/>
to sit in the <HI>Divano,</HI> nor affordeth more reverence to
the Emperour, than he to him. The other sort of Church∣men
are the <HI>Naipi</HI> or young Doctors, the <HI>Caddi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turkish</HI> Church-men.</NOTE> whereof
there is two or three in every City to judge the offences;
the <HI>Calsi</HI> or Readers, and the <HI>Mudressi,</HI> which use to over∣see
the <HI>Caddeis</HI> in their Office: They were all formerly
Idolatrous <HI>Pagans,</HI> and were fast initiated in <HI>Mahometa∣nisme,</HI>
when they got the Sovereigntie of the <HI>Persian</HI>
Scepter; by the great Battaile, and fortunate conduct
of <HI>Tangrolipix,</HI> in overthrowing <HI>Mahomet</HI> a <HI>Saracenicall
Sultan</HI> of <HI>Persia;</HI> who inthronized himselfe, in the <HI>Persian</HI>
Chaire of Estate, <HI>Anno</HI> 1030. This prerogative Title of
<HI>Mufti,</HI> was first intitled <HI>Caliph,</HI> whose residence was in
<HI>Babylon,</HI> and wholly supream over the <HI>Mahometans:</HI> But
the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> after the death of <HI>Mot adi Bila,</HI> withdrew
themselves from this <HI>Babylonian</HI> obedience, and chused
one of their owne, to whom the <HI>Moores</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> sub∣mitted
themselves.</P>
<P>But now since <HI>Bagdat,</HI> or <HI>Babylon</HI> hath been reco∣vered
by the <HI>Persians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Babylon</HI> recovered by the <HI>Persians.</HI></NOTE> about foure yeares ago, their <HI>Mahome∣tanicall
Mufti</HI> or <HI>Caliph,</HI> that then was resident there, is
now retired to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where he sitteth in a more
securer place, thinking rather to follow the Grandeur of
the <HI>Turke,</HI> than the broken Estate of the <HI>Persian,</HI> whence
I may truly say, hee is Fortunes Page, that favoureth them
most, who have most favourers.</P>
<P>This unwealdy body having two heads, began to de∣cline;
for <HI>Allan</HI> a <HI>Tartarian</HI> Captaine, starved <HI>Mustat∣zem</HI>
the last divided <HI>Babylonian Caliph</HI> to death and roo∣ted
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut all his posterity: And then <HI>Sarancon</HI> the first <HI>Tur∣kish</HI>
King in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> brained the last <HI>Aegyptian Caliph</HI> with
his Mace, leaving none of the Issue, or Kindred survi∣ving.
The Office of the <HI>Caliph</HI> is now executed in <HI>Turkie</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="82"/>
under the name <HI>Mufti,</HI> or high Priest. All <HI>Turkes</HI> do
detest the colour of blacke, and thinke those that weare it,
shall never enter into Paradise: But the colour of greatest
request among them is greene; wherewith if any Christi∣an
be apparrelled, he shall be sure of Bastinadoes, and o∣ther
punishments: Neither may he use the name of their
Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his mouth, (under the paine of a
<HI>cruell</HI> censure to be inflicted upon him) whom they so
much adore, and honour.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mahomet</HI> was borne, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 591. in <HI>Itraripia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> birth.</NOTE>
a beggarly Village in <HI>Arabia,</HI> whose father whs <HI>Ab∣dillas,</HI>
an <HI>Ismaelite;</HI> and his mother <HI>Cadiges,</HI> a <HI>Iew;</HI> both
different in Religion, and also of diverse Countries: In his
youth he was partly taught the <HI>Iudaicall</HI> Law, and partly
the superstition of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Many alleadge his paren∣tage
was never knowne (being so base) untill his riper
yeares bewrayed the same: I also learned that his Pa∣rents
dyed whilst he was a young child, and was turned
over to his Uncle, who afterward sold him to one <HI>Abde∣minoples,</HI>
a Merchant in <HI>Palestina:</HI> And he, after a little
time, having remarked his ready and prompt wit, sent
him downe to <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to be a Factor in his Merchandise,
where, by his dissimulate behaviour, he crept in favour
with <HI>Christians, Iewes,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> He was in propor∣tion
of meane stature, lively faced, big-headed, eloquent
in language, of a sanguinicall complexion, and a couragi∣ous
stomacke, in all attempts exceeding desperate: he was
also deceitfull, variant and fraudulent, as may appeare
in his Satanicall Fables, expressed in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> where
oft one saying contradicteth another, both in words,
and effect.</P>
<P>About this time there was one <HI>Sergius,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> born,
binished from <HI>Constantinopole,</HI> because he allowed of the
<PB N="146" REF="83"/>
<HI>Arrian</HI> sect; who afterward came to <HI>Palestina,</HI> and fre∣quenting
the house of <HI>Abdeminoples,</HI> fell in acquaintance
with the young man <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and this Frier perceiving
the aspiring quicknes of his braine, bore a great affection
to his naturall perfections. Shortly after this, his Master
dying without heires, and his Mistresse injoying many
rich possessions; she, for these his extraordinary quallities,
from the degree of a Servant, advanced him to be her own
Husband.</P>
<P>That unhappy match was no sooner done but she repen∣ted
it with teares: for he being subject to the falling sick∣nesse,
would often fall flat on the ground before her, sta∣ring,
gaping, and foaming at the mouth; so that his com∣pany
became loathsome and detestable.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet</HI> pos∣sessed with the falling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cknesse.</NOTE> The which be∣got
contempt in his bed-fellow; being to him manifested,
he strove (under the shadow of invented lies) to mitigate
the fury of her hatefull disdaine; faining, and attesting,
that when he fell to the ground, it was the great God
spoke with him, before whose face (saith hee) I am not
able to stand▪ such is the soliciting of me, with words of
terrour and Majesty, to reforme the wayes of the de∣generate
people with fire and sword; sith <HI>Moses</HI> and
<HI>Christ</HI> (notwithstanding of their miracles) have beene re∣jected
by the world. The old <HI>Trot,</HI> believing all these flat∣tering
speeches, was not only appeased of her former con∣ceit,
but also loving him more then a husband, reverenced
him for a divine Prophet; imparting, the same unto her
neighbours and gossips. After they had lived two yeares
together, the bewitched Matron dying, left all her posses∣sions
to <HI>Mahomet;</HI> both because she accounted him to be a
Prophet, and next for that loving regard she had of his
render body, being but 30 yeares of age. He being thus
left with great riches, was puft up in pride and hauty de∣sires,
<PB N="147" REF="83"/>
striving by all inordinary meanes, to bring his new
devised plots to perfection. For the better performance
whereof, he consulted with this <HI>Sergius</HI> a <HI>Nestorian</HI> Monk,
and <HI>Atodala</HI> another <HI>Thalmudist,</HI> a diverted <HI>Iew:</HI> hereup∣on
these two helhounds, &amp; the other perverst Runnagate,
patchedup a most monstrous, and divellish Religion to
themselves, and to their miscreant beleevers; partly com∣posed
of the <HI>Iudaicall</HI> law, partly of <HI>Arrianisme,</HI> partly in∣termixed
with some points of <HI>Christianity;</HI> and partly of
other fantasticall, fopperies, which his owne invention
suggested unto him.</P>
<P>The Booke of this Religion is named the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the
whole body of which, is but an exposition, and glosse on
the eight commandements he affixed; whereupon depen∣deth
the whole <HI>Mahomet anicall</HI> Law: First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> <HI>every one
ought to beleeve that God is a great God, and onely God, and</HI>
Mahomet <HI>is his Prophet.</HI> Secondly, <HI>every man must marry
to encrease the Sectaries of</HI> Mahomet: Thirdly, <HI>every one
must give of his his wealth to the poore:</HI> Fourthly, <HI>every one
must make his prayers seven times a day:</HI> Fiftly, <HI>every one
must keep a Lent, one moneth in the yeare,</HI> this Lent is <HI>cal∣led
Byrham,</HI> or <HI>Ramazan:</HI> Sixtly, <HI>Be obedient to thy Pa∣rents;</HI>
which Law is so neglected, that never any children
were, or are more unnaturall then the <HI>Turkish</HI> be: Se∣venthly,
<HI>thou shalt not kill,</HI> which they inviolable keepe a∣mongst
themselves; but the poore Christians feele the
smart thereof. Last and eightly <HI>Doe unto others, as thou
wouldst be done unto thyselfe,</HI> the performers of which
have large <HI>Sophisticall</HI> promises ascribed them.</P>
<P>This new coyned doctrine, was no sooner wrapt up in
his execrable <HI>Alooran,</HI> but he began to spit forth his ab∣hominable
and blasphenious heresies: Affirming, that
<HI>Christ</HI> was not the sonne of the most high, nor that <HI>Mes∣sias</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="84"/>
looked for; denying also the Trinity, with many o∣ther
prophane blasphemies. The worke concluded, for
the better advancement of his purpose, he married the
daughter of the chiefe Prince of his own tribe: By which
new affinity, he not onely seduced his Father in law, but
also the whole linage of that family; by whose acceptance,
and convertion, he also consederated with other associ∣ates,
and waxed daily stronger. Contending continually
to divulgate his name, aye more and more, he assembled
his new <HI>Alcoranist:</HI> exhorting them to assist him in the
besieging of <HI>Mecha,</HI> which Citizens had in derision rebu∣ked
his law, and absolutely disdained his <HI>Mahometicall</HI>
illusions: and promised to them, in such a well deserving
attempt, both eternall felicity and the spoyles of these
his contradictors; perswasively assuring them, that God
would deliver all the gaine-sayers of his <HI>Alcoran</HI> into his
hands. By which allurements they being moved, rose to
the number of 3000 in Armes, and menaced <HI>Mecha,</HI> but
the Citizens put him to flight, and so was he thrice ser∣ved;
till in the end he wonne their City:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomets</HI> Tombe.</NOTE> wherein after his
death he was intombed in an Iron Coffin: Which be∣twene
two Adamants hangeth to this day (as I have been
informed of sundry <HI>Turkes,</HI> who saw it) which confirmed
in them a solid beliefe of his erronious doctrine.</P>
<P>But now of late the <HI>Turkes</HI> growing more circumspect
then they were, and understanding the derision of Chri∣stians
concerning their hanging Tombe, and because the
<HI>Turkish</HI> Pilgrimes were often suffocated to death with a
fabulous desert in going to <HI>Mecha;</HI> they have transported
<HI>Mahomets</HI> Tombe now to <HI>Medina;</HI> which is a great deale
nearer to <HI>Damascus,</HI> and at the entry of <HI>Arabia foelix;</HI> in
a glorious <HI>Mosquee</HI> where the Tombe being close ground
set, and richly covered with a golden <HI>Cannopy;</HI> they have
<PB N="149" REF="85"/>
inhibited that any Christian shall come neare to it by two
courses, to wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, twenty foure miles, under the paine of
death: which indeed they keep more strictly in execution,
then Princely Proclamations are obeyed, observed, or re∣garded
with us: either for Regall Statutes, or generall be∣nefits
of Common-wealth: their continuance being but
like the miracle of nine dayes wonder; return again from
whence they came frustrate of power, and robbed of obe∣dience.
From this time that he vanquished <HI>Mecha,</HI> casting
out the <HI>Greek</HI> Officers, (for then all <HI>Arabia</HI> was under the
<HI>Constantinoplitan</HI> Empire) the <HI>Sarazens</HI> began their com∣putation
of yeares (as we from Christs Nativity) which
they call <HI>Hegira,</HI> and begun about the yeare of our Re∣demption,
617. Concerning which time, that <HI>Mahomet</HI>
compiled his devillish <HI>Alcoran,</HI> beginning his Empire;

and Idols of Stone, Iron, and Timber, &amp;c. that for ma,
ny hundred years they were not suffered to be seen? And
at the beginning of the Papality,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romish</HI> Ido∣latry.</NOTE> and a long time after, the
Emperours prohibit them, and divers Popes have confir∣med,
and approved the same: Yet succeeding Popes, and
the Empire being divided in East and West, introducted
again the dregs of their old Heathenish and <HI>Roman</HI> Ido∣latry:
and yet they will not be content with the bare name
of Images, but they impose a sirname or epithite of san∣ctitie,
termimg them holy Images▪ Truly I may say, if it
were not for these Images, and superstitious Idolatries,
they assigne to them, the <HI>Turks</HI> had long ago beene con∣verted
to the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>I have seen somtimes 2000 <HI>Turks</HI> travelling to <HI>Mecha,</HI>
in Pilgrimage; which is in <HI>Arabia foelix:</HI> where many in a
superstitious devotion, having seen the Tombe of <HI>Maho∣met,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turkish</HI> Pilgrims.</NOTE>
are never desirous to see the vanities of the World
again: For in a frantick piety they cause a Smith to pull
forth their eys: And these men are called afterward <HI>Hog∣geis,</HI>
that is <HI>Holy-men,</HI> whom the <HI>Turks</HI> much honour, and
regard: and are always led about from Towne to Towne
by mens hands, and fed, and regarded like unto Princes;
or like the <HI>Capuchins</HI> that scourge themselves on good
Friday, met, and homaged at every passing street, with
prayers, gifts, and adorations.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="86"/>
Some write, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his youth was a Soul∣dier,
under the conduct of <HI>Heraclins,</HI> who impl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying cer∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine
<HI>Arabians</HI> in an expedition to <HI>Persla,</HI> not onely deni∣ed
them their wages, but told them, that, that was not to
be given for Dogs, which was provided for the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Souldiers. Hence some mutinies arising in the Ar∣my,
he, with certaine <HI>Arabians,</HI> his Cuntry men, by fa∣ction,
seperated themselves, and revolted: Whereupon
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> encouraging them in their defection, was cho∣sen
their Captain; and so for a certaine time they conti∣nued
rebellious Runnagates, Theeves, and Robbers of all
people.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahomet</HI> hath broke his pro∣mise.</NOTE> The subtlety of this dissembler was admirable,
who knowing that he was destitute of heavenly gifts, to
work miracles, feign'd, that <HI>God</HI> sent him with the sword:
He also promised, at the end of a thousand yeares to re∣turne
and bring them to Paradice; but he hath falsified
his promise, for the time is expired fortie yares agoe. And
they imagining, that he is either diseased, or become lame
in his journey, have ascribed to him another thousand
yeares to come. But long may their wicked and faithlesse
generation gape, before he come, untill such time, that in
a generall convocation, they be partakers of his endlesse
damnation in Hell; unlesse it please the Lord in his mer∣cy
to convert them before that time.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> chiefly prohibiteth in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the ea∣ting
of Swines flesh, and drinking of Wine, which indeed
the best sort do, but the baser kind are daily drunkards▪
Their common drinke is <HI>Sherpet,</HI> composed of water,
Honey, and Sugar, which is exceeding delectable in the
taste: And the usuall courtesie, they bestow on their
friends, who visit them, is a Cup of <HI>Coffa</HI> made of a kind
of seed called <HI>Coava,</HI> and of a blackish colour; which they
drinke so hot as possible they can, and it is good to expell
<PB N="152" REF="87"/>
the crudity of raw meates, and hearbes, so much by them
frequented. And that those cannot attain to this liquour,
must be contented with the cooling streames of water.</P>
<P>It is incident to <HI>Turkes,</HI> which have not the generosity
of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppression of <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> to temper felicity, to be glutted with the super∣fluous
fruites of doubtfull prosperity. Neither have they
a patient resolution to withstand adversity, nor hope to
expect the better alteration of time. But by an infused
malice in their wicked spirits, when they are any way
calamited, will with importunate compulsion, cause the
poor slavish subiected Christians, surrender all they have,
the halfe, or so forth, somtimes with strokes, menacings,
and somtimes death it selfe; which plainly doth demon∣strate
their excessive cruelty, and the poore Christians in∣evitable
misery. And yea being complained upon, they
are severely punished, or else put to death, for committing
of such unallowed Ryots, being expresly against the Im∣periall
Law of the <HI>Turke,</HI> concerning the quietnesse and li∣berty
of the Christians.</P>
<P>I have often heard <HI>Turkes</HI> brawle one with another,
most vilely but I never saw or heard that they either in
private or publicke quarrels, durst strike one another, nei∣ther
dare they for feare of severe punishment imposed to
such quarrellers: But they will injure and strike Chri∣stians,
who dare not say it is a misse, or strike again. It is a
common thing with them, to kill their seruants for a very
small offence, and when they have done, throw them like
Dogs in a Ditch. And oftentimes (if not so) will lay
them downe on their backes, hoysing up their heeles,
bind their feete together, and fasten them to a post, and
with a cudgell give them three or foure hundred blows
on the soles of their feete: whereupon peraduenture,
some ever go lame after. Their servants are bought and
<PB N="153" REF="87"/>
sold, like bruit beasts in Markets; neither can these mise∣rable
drudges ever recover liberty, except they buy them∣selves
free, either by one means or other. Their wives are
not far from the like servitude, for the men by the <HI>Alco∣ran,</HI>
are admitted to marry as many women as they will, or
their ability can keep. And if it shall happen, that any one
of these women (I mean either Wife or Concubine) pro∣ftituteth
her selfe to an other man besides her Husband;
then may he by authority, binde her hands and feet, hang
a stone about her neck, and cast her into a River, which by
them is usually done in the night.</P>
<P>But when these Infidels please to abuse poore Christian
women against their Husbands will, they little regard the
transgression of the Christian Law; who as well defloure
their Daughters, as their Wives; yet the devout <HI>Mahome∣tans</HI>
never meddle with them, accounting themselves
damned to copulate (as they think) with the off-spring of
Dogs. The <HI>Turks</HI> generally, when they commit any co∣pulation
with Christians, or their owne sexe, they wash
themselves in a South running Fountaine, before the Sun
rising, thinking thereby to wash away their sins.</P>
<P>If a <HI>Turke</HI> should happen to kill another <HI>Turke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Iustice.</NOTE> his
punishment is thus; after he is adjudged to death, he is
brought forth to the Market place, and a blocke being
brought hither of foure foot high; the malefactor is
stript naked; and then laid thereupon with his belly
downward, they draw in his middle together so small
with running cords, that they strike his body a two with
one blow: his hinder parts they cast to be eaten by hungry
Dogs kept for the same purpose; and the fore-quarters
and head they throw into a grievous fire, made there
for the same end: and this is the punishment for man-slaughter.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="88"/>
But for murder or treason he is more cruelly used, for
being convicted and condemned, he is brought forth be∣fore
the people, where in the street there is an exceeding
high <HI>Stripad</HI> er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted, much like to a May-pole: which tree
from the root, till it almost come to the top, it all set a∣bout
full of long sharpe iron pikes, and their points up∣ward:
the villain being strip'd naked, and his hands bound
backward, they binde a strong rope about his shoulders
and cleavings: And then hoysing him up to the pillow or
top of the tree, they let the rope flee loose, whence down
he fals, with a rattle, among the iron pikes, hanging either
by the buttocks, by the brests, by the sides, or shoulders;
and there sticking fast in the aire, he hangeth till his very
bones rot and fall down, and his body be devoured being
quick, with ravenous Eagles, kept to prey upon his car∣casse
for the same purpose.</P>
<P>But now I come to their Nuptiall Rites, their custome
and manner of Marriage is thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turkish</HI> Mar∣iages.</NOTE> If a man affecteth a yong
maid, hee buyeth her of her parents, and giveth a good
summe of money for her, and after shee is bought, he en∣rols
her name in the <HI>Cadies</HI> Booke, witnessing shee is his
bound wife, bought of her father, Lo, this is all the form
of their Marriage: This being done, the father of the wo∣man
sendeth houshold-stuffe home with the Bride; which
is carried through the streets on Mulets or Camels backs,
the two new married folks marching before, are conveyed
with musique, their owne acquaintance and friends unto
his house.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkes</HI> in generall, whensoever they loath or dis∣like
their wives, use to sell them in Markets, or otherwise
bestow them on their men-slaves: And although their af∣fection
were never so great towards them, yet they never
eat together, for commonly the women stand, and serve
<PB N="155" REF="88"/>
their Husbands at meate, and after that, that eate a part
by themselves, secretly; without admission of any man∣kinde
in their company, if they be above fourteen years
of age. They go seldome abroad, unlesse it be each Thurs∣day
at night, when they goe to the Graves to mourne
for the dead, always covering their faces, very modest∣ly
with white or black Maskes, which are never unce∣vered,
till they return to their Houses. Many other Cere∣monies
they have, which would be too prolix for mee to
recite. And notwithstanding of all this externall gravity,
amongst these hirelings, yet there are in <HI>Constantinople</HI>
above 40000 Brothel-houses, <HI>Turqueski</HI> as <HI>Libertines;</HI> in
any of which, if a Christian (especially <HI>Francks</HI>) be ap∣prehended,
hee must either turne <HI>Turke,</HI> or Slave all his
life: But the women by policie apply a counterpoyson to
this severity, for they accustomably come to the Cham∣bers
of their Benefactors and well-willers, or other places
appointed secretly, where so they learne either a <HI>French
Syncopa,</HI> or an <HI>Italian Bergamasko.</HI></P>
<P>As for the great <HI>Turkes</HI> Concubines, they are of num∣ber
eight hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣rours Concu∣bines.</NOTE> being the most part <HI>Emeeres, Ba∣shawes,</HI>
and <HI>Timariots</HI> daughters: The third and inmost
part of the <HI>Seraglia</HI> is allotted for their Residence, be∣ing
well attended at all times with numbers of <HI>Ennuchs,</HI>
and other gelded officers: Every morning they are ranked
in a great Hall, and set on high and open seats: where
when hee commeth, and selecting the youngest and fai∣rest,
hee toucheth her with a Rod; and immediately
shee followeth him into his Cabine of Leachery, where
if any action be done, shee receiveth from the Head-Clerke
her approbation thereupon, which ever after∣wards
serveth her for a conditionall Dowry to her Mar∣riage,
with much honour and reputation besides: And
<PB N="156" REF="89"/>
if any of them conceive, and the childe borne, it is
suddenly dispatched from this life: The oldest hundreth,
every first Friday of the moneth are turned out, and an∣other
new hundred come in to make good the number:
Their entry and issue is alwayes at one of the posterne
gates of the Parke, toward the Sea side, and joyning nigh
to their Palace:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hundred Concubines changed every moneth.</NOTE> Whence crossing <HI>Bosphore,</HI> in an appoin∣ted
Barge, they both go and come in one day, from and
too the <HI>Galata,</HI> which I my selfe did see three severall
times: The oldest and last hundred that are every moneth
dismissed, they depart from the <HI>Galata,</HI> home to
their Parents and severall Countries, rejoycing that they
were counted worthy to be chosen and entertained to be
their Emperours Concubines. The custome of the great
<HI>Turke</HI> is, every Friday being their Sabbath day after
their Service and Dinner, to run at the Glove in an open
place before all the people, with some <HI>Hagars,</HI> or young
striplings that accompany him; who have the Glove
hanging as high on a stick, as we have the Ring with us:
And truly of all the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperours that ever were,
this <HI>Achmet</HI> was the most gentle and favourable to Chri∣stians;
who rather for his bounty and tendernesse might
have beene intitulated the Christian Emperour, then the
<HI>Pagan</HI> King: for hee disanulled all the exactions that had
been inflicted by his predecessors upon his tributary Chri∣stian
subjects; and cancelled the custome or tithe of their
Male children, abrogating also that imposition on their
Female Dowries.</P>
<P>The Lent of the <HI>Turkes</HI> is called <HI>Byrham,</HI> which con∣tinueth
the space of a moneth once in the yeare: In all
which time, from the Sunne rising to his setting, they
neither eat nor drinke: And at their prayers (especially
in this fasting) they use often to reiterate these words
<PB N="157" REF="89"/>
<HI>Hue, hue, hue,</HI> that is; <HI>he, he, he alone is God;</HI> or, <HI>There
is but one onely supreme Power;</HI> which they doe in de∣rision
of Christians, who (as they say) adore three Gods.
They have also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sinister opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Paradice,</NOTE> that at the day of
Iudgement, when <HI>Mahomet</HI> shall appeare, there shall
bee three displayed Banners, under the which all good
people shall be conducted to paradise: the one of <HI>Moses,</HI>
under the which the children of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be: the se∣cond
of <HI>Iesus,</HI> under which Christians shall bee: The
third of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> under the which shall be the <HI>Arabs,
Turks,</HI> and <HI>Musilmans:</HI> All which, they think, shall be ele∣vated
to severall honours; and they in promotion shall
bee discerned from the rest, by Chambers made of re∣splendant
light, which God will give them; wherein they
shall have banquetings, feastings, dancing, and the best
melody can be devised; and that they shall spend their
times with amorous Virgins, (whose mansion shall be
neer by) the men never exceeding the age of thirty yeers,
and the Virgins fifteen, and both shall have their Virgini∣ties
renewed, as fast, as lost.</P>
<P>They hold also this, as a confident Article of their Be∣liefe,
there are seven Paradices in Heaven, the pave∣ments
whereof are laid with gold, silver, pearles, pre∣cious
stones, and garnished with stately buildings, and
pleasant Gardens, wherein are all sorts of fruit, and
Princely Palaces; through the which run Rivers of Milk,
Honey, and Wine.</P>
<P>The first Paradice, they call it <HI>Genete, Alcholde,</HI> the
second <HI>Alfirduzy,</HI> the third <HI>Anthinak,</HI> the fourth <HI>Re∣duasch,</HI>
the fift <HI>Azelem,</HI> the sixt <HI>Alcodush,</HI> that is holy, and
the seventh <HI>Almega,</HI> that is, the greatest. And that in
the midst of this last Paradise, there is a stately tree, called
<HI>Tubah,</HI> the lease of which is partly of gold, and partly
<PB N="158" REF="90"/>
of silver: whose boughs extend round about the wals of
this seventh Paradice, whereon the name of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is
written, neere to the name of God, in these words, <HI>Alla
illa, he, all ah, Mahomet Rezul allah.</HI> The which words are
in such reverence amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> that if a <HI>Christian</HI>
should happen, unadvisedly to repeat them, he is adjudged
to a most cruell death, or compulsed to renounce his
Christian Religion.</P>
<P>Their Lent lasteth 30 days, called <HI>Byrham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> Lent.</NOTE> some name
it also <HI>Ramadan;</HI> induring which time, they eat nor drink
nothing from Sun rising to its setting downe: but when
night commeth they gurmandize at their selfe pleasures:
Their moneth of Lent is our <HI>Ianuary,</HI> where every day af∣ter
their severall devotions, they go to solemne plays; and
all kinde of prophane pastimes: counting that best devo∣tion,
which is most sutable to their dispositions; allotting
fancie to follow their folly, and blindnesse, to overtop
the ignorance of Nature, drawing all their drifts with∣in
the circle of destruction: But indeed, as they are blind,
in the true way of sacred worship; yet are they masked
with a wonderfull zeale to their devoted blindnesse; sur∣passing
far in shew, and observations, the generall Profes∣sors
of Christianity, and all the Ceremonies can be an∣nexed
thereunto: Theirs running on with the flouds
of ignorant affection, and ours distracted with the inutile
novelties of superfluous School questions: which indeed
doe more distemper the truth, than render God to be
rightly glorified.</P>
<P>As concerning their opinion of Hell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> opinion of Hell.</NOTE> they hold it to be
a deepe Gulfe, betwixt two Mountains: from the mouth
whereof are Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gons, that continually throw fire, being
large eight leagues, and hath a darke entry, where the
horrible Fiends meet the perplexed sinners, conveying
<PB N="159" REF="90"/>
them till they come to a Bridge, that is so narrow as the
edge of a Razor: whereupon these who have not com∣mitted
hainous offences, may passe over to Hell, but those
who have done Buggery (as the most part of them do) and
homicide shall fall headlong from it, to the profoundest
pit in Hell, where they shall somtimes burne in fire and
somtimes be cast into hot boyling waters to be refreshed.
And for the greater punishment of the wicked (say they)
God hath planted a Tree in Hell named <HI>Sajaratash,</HI> or
<HI>Roozo Saytanah,</HI> that is, the head of the Devill, upon the
fruit of which, the damned continually feed: <HI>Mahomet</HI> in
one of the Chapters of his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> calleth this Tree, the
<HI>Tree of Malediction.</HI></P>
<P>They also thinke the tormented soules may one day be
saved, providing they doe indure the scorching flames of
Hell patiently. Thus, as briefly as I could, have I laid open
the opinions of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> concerning their Heaven and
Hell, before the eyes of these, who peradventure have ne∣ver
been acquainted with such a ghostly Discourse.</P>
<P>And now I think it not amisse to reckon you up in ge∣nerall
all the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Emperors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all the Em¦perours in East &amp; West.</NOTE> that have been
from the beginning to this present time, both in the East,
and in the West, with the number of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Em∣perours
also: Beginning now at <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> the first Di∣ctatour
or <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, to <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great,
who transported the seat of the Empire from <HI>Rome</HI> to
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> hee was the three score and fourth Empe∣rour:
And from <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great in the East, to the
first made Emperour in the West, there were thirty nine
Emperours: of whom <HI>Constantine</HI> the sixth, sonne to <HI>Leo</HI>
the third, with <HI>Irena</HI> his wife was the last sole Emperour,
and shee Empresse of East and West: After whose death
and overthrow, <HI>Charlemaine</HI> was called into <HI>Italy</HI> to
<PB N="160" REF="91"/>
Danton the <HI>Lombards,</HI> who had oppressed that Region,
and the peace of the Church for two hundred yeares: He
chased them from <HI>Rome, Apulia,</HI> and from all <HI>Italy,</HI> and
was therefore declared by Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Empe∣rour
of the West: from <HI>Charlemain</HI> to this present <HI>Ferdi∣nando</HI>
that now reigneth, <HI>Charlemaine</HI> being the hundred
and fourth, there were forty and one Emperours: So in all,
with this Emperor <HI>Ferdinando</HI> lately Duke of <HI>Grasse,</HI> the
number amounts to of these Emperours, counting from
<HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> to <HI>Constantine</HI> the sixt, the last sole Empe∣rour
of the East, and after him, from <HI>Charlemain</HI> the first
Emperour of the West, to this time, their number have
been a hundred and forty six Emperours.</P>
<P>Some whereof were <HI>Greekes,</HI> which cannot perfectly
be set down, in regard some were Emperesses, and others
suddenly elected, were as suddenly murthered or poyso∣ned.</P>
<P>Now to reckon the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperours, I will first begin
from the time that the <HI>Turks</HI> tooke a Monarchall name,
under the name of <HI>Ottoman,</HI> even to <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second,
the first <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperour, beginning, I say at <HI>Ottoman,</HI>
the son of <HI>Orthogule</HI> the first Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and
the first that erected the glory of his Nation; there were
nine Emperours to <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second: And from him
to this present <HI>Amurath,</HI> that now reigneth, there have bin
eleven Emperors: The number of which are onely twenty,
and before they come to thirty, they and theirs, I hope,
shall be rooted from the earth.</P>
<P>The Originall of the <HI>Turkes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin∣ning of the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> is said to have been in
<HI>Scythia,</HI> from whence they came to <HI>Arabia p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tnea,</HI> and
giving battell oft to the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> in the end subdued
them, and so they multiplyed, and mightily increased:
the apparance of their further increasing, is very evident,
<PB N="161" REF="91"/>
except God of his mercy towards us prevent their blood-sucking
threatnings, with the vengeance of his just judge∣ments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sarazens</HI> are descended of <HI>Esau,</HI> who after he had
lost the blessing, went and inhabited in <HI>Arabia Petrea;</HI>
and his posterity, striving to make a cleere distinction be∣tweene
them, the <HI>Ismaelites,</HI> and <HI>Iewes,</HI> called themselves
(as come of <HI>Sara) Sarazens;</HI> and not of <HI>Hagar,</HI> the hand∣maid
of <HI>Abraham,</HI> of whom came the <HI>Ismaelites,</HI> neither
of the race of <HI>Iacob,</HI> of whom came the <HI>Iewes.</HI> But now
the <HI>Sarazens</HI> being joyned with the <HI>Turkes,</HI> their Con∣querours,
have both lost their name, and the right of their
discent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkes</HI> which are borne and bred in the lesser <HI>Asia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> complexion.</NOTE>
and East-parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> are generally well complexio∣ned,
proportionably compacted, no idle nor superfluous
talkers, servile to their grand Signior, excessively inclined
to Venery, and zealous in Religion: their heads are al∣wayes
shaven, reserving onely one tuft in the top above,
by which they thinke one day to be caught to Heaven by
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> and covered on all sides, counting it an oppro∣brious
thing to see any uncover his head; they weare their
beards long, as a signe of gravity, for they esteeme them to
be wise men who have long beards: The women are of
a low stature, thick and round of growth, going seldome
abroad, unlesse it be each thursday at night, when they go
to mourn upon the graves of their dead friends, and then
they are modestly masked: they are fearefull and shame∣fac'd
abroad, but lascivious within doors, and pleasing in
matters of incontinency; and they are accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed most
beautifull who have the blackest browes, the widest
mouths, and the greatest eyes.</P>
<P>The other <HI>Turkes</HI> which are borne in <HI>Asia Major,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="92"/>
and <HI>Aegypt</HI> (I speake not of the <HI>Moores</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI>) are of
a great stature, tauny, cruell, a barbarous and uncivill
people. The better sort use the <HI>Salavonian</HI> tongue, the vul∣gar
speake the <HI>Turkish</HI> language, which being originally
the <HI>Tartarian</HI> speech, they borrow from the <HI>Persian</HI> their
words of state, from the <HI>Arabicke,</HI> their words of Religi∣on,
from the <HI>Grecians</HI> their termes of warre, and from
the <HI>Italian</HI> their words and titles of navigation.</P>
<P>The puissance of the great <HI>Turke</HI> is admirable, yet the
most part of his Kingdomes in <HI>Asia,</HI> are not well inha∣bited,
neither populous, but these parts which border
with Christians, are strongly fortified with Castles, peo∣ple,
and munition: If Christian Princes could concord,
and consult together, it were an easie thing in one yeare
to subdue the <HI>Turkes,</HI> and root out their very names
from the earth; yea moreover I am certified, that there
are more Christians even slaves and subjects to the great
<HI>Turke,</HI> which do inhabit his dominions, then might over∣throw
and conquer these Infidells, if they had worthy
Captaines, Governours and furniture of Armes, without
the helpe of any Christian Prince of Christendome.</P>
<P>And yet again, I think it not amisse to discourse more
particularly of the <HI>Turkish</HI> manners, of their riches,
and of their forces of warres, and the manner of their
conducements.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkes</HI> being naturally discended of the <HI>Scythians</HI>
of <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turks</HI> are <HI>Tartarians</HI></NOTE> are of the second stature of man, and robust
of nature, circumspect and couragious in all their at∣tempts,
and no way given to industry or labour, but
are wonderfull avaritious and covetous of money a∣bove
all the nations of the World. They never observe
their promises; unlesse it be with advantage, and are
naturally prone to deceive strangers; changing their con∣ditionall
<PB N="163" REF="92"/>
bargains, as time giveth occasion to their liking;
They are humble one to another, but especially to their
superiours, before whom they doe not onely great ho∣mage,
but also keepe great silence, and are wonderfull
coy during the time of their presence: They are extream∣ly
inclined to all sorts of lascivious luxury; and gene∣rally
addicted, besides all their sensuall and incestuous lusts,
unto <HI>Sodomy,</HI> which they account as a daynty to di∣gest
all their other libidinous pleasures. They hold
that every one hath the houre of his death wrot on his
fore brow, and that none can escape, the good or evill
houre predestinated for them: This ridiculous errour
makes them so bold and desperate, yea, and often, to
runne headlong in the most inevitable dangers: They
are not much given to domesticke pastimes, as Chesse,
Cards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Libidinous <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> Dice, and Tables; but abroad and in travell they
are exceeding kind disposers of their meate and drinke
to any stranger without exception: The better sort of
their women, are sumptuously attired, and adorned with
pearles and precious stones, and some of them are accu∣stomed
to turn their hands and hair into a red colour, but
especially the nayls of their hands and feet; and are wont
to go to bathe themselves in Stoves twice a week, as well
as men.</P>
<P>The true <HI>Turks</HI> weare on their heads white Turbants,
save a few that are esteem'd to be of <HI>Mahomet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Kindred,
and they weare greene Shashes, being most part of them
Priests: the better part of the <HI>Turkes</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> care not
for fish, but these <HI>Turks</HI> which remayne in <HI>Europe</HI> love
Fish better then Flesh, especially at <HI>Constantinople</HI> or
<HI>Stambolda,</HI> where the best Fishes and most abundance
of them are taken that be in the World, and that in the
blacke Sea: They are ever desirous to seeke advantage
<PB N="164" REF="93"/>
on their neighbours, which if they cannot by force, they
will under colour of truce, accomplish it with perfidious∣nesse.
And if their enterprises, find no happy event, they
are never a whit ashamed to take the flight, yet are they
generally good Souldiers, and well taught in Martiall
discipline: Their Armies in marching, or camping (not∣withstanding
infinite multitudes) keepe modesty and
silence, and are extreamly obedient unto their Captaines
and Commanders: When the great Signior is abroad
with his Army at Warres, the Turkes at home within
Townes, use great praiers and fasting for him and them.
They ingeniously describe the victories of their Ance∣stors,
and joyfully sing them in Rimes and Songs; thin∣king
thereby that fashion in recalling the valiant deedes
of their Predecessours, to be the onely meanes to encou∣rage
their souldiers to be hardy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turkes</HI> are no Schollars.</NOTE> resolute and desperate
in all their enterprises: They are not given to contempla∣tion,
nor study of Letters or Arts; yet they have divers
faire Schooles, where the publicke Lecture of their legall
Lawes are professed, and <HI>Mahometanisme;</HI> to the intent
that Children, being elected to be brought up there for a
time may be instructed, to be profitable expounders of
their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and judicious Judges for the govern∣ment
of the Common-wealth: It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eldome, and rarely
seene, that a <HI>Turke</HI> will speake with a woman in the
streets; nay, not so much as in their <HI>Mosquees</HI> one to be
in sight of another; and yet they are Lords and Masters
of their Wives and Concubines, from whom they re∣ceive
as great respect, service, and honour, as from their
bond and bought slaves.</P>
<P>Now as concerning his riches, the chiefest three parts
of Commerce of all kind of merchandise, and abounding
in silver and gold in all the <HI>Turkes</HI> dominions, as well in
<PB N="165" REF="93"/>
<HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Affrick,</HI> as <HI>Europe,</HI> are these <HI>Constantinople</HI> in
<HI>Thracia</HI> of <HI>Europe: Aleppo</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> of <HI>Asia major;</HI> and
Grand <HI>Cairo</HI> in <HI>Aegypt</HI> of <HI>Affrick:</HI> for these are the three
Magezines of the whole Empire, that draw the whole
riches, money, and trafficke to them of all the Imperiall
Provinces:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Great <HI>Turks</HI> yeerly rent.</NOTE> It is thought that ordinarily and annually the
Rent of the great <HI>Turke</HI> amounteth to sixteen Millions of
Gold, notwithstanding that some do make it lesser: But
because it is so hard to judge of any Monarchs Rents; be∣ing
like the infinite concavities of the earth, sending, and
receiving so innumerable wayes their streames of riches,
I'le desist from any other instances: And yet the great
<HI>Turks</HI> revenues, are no way answerable to his great and
large Dominions: The causes arising hereupon are many,
of whom I will select three or foure of the chiefest rea∣sons:
First the <HI>Turkes</HI> being more given to armes, to con∣quer,
to destroy and ruine, and to consume the wealth of
the people they overcome, leaving them destitute, of nu∣riture;
rather then any way to give course for their encrea∣sing
and stablishing of trafficke, out of which should flow
the Royall advantages. And the reason why they keepe
their subjects poore, and frustrate themselves of great pro∣fits;
is onely to weaken, and enfeeble them, whereby they
should not have wherewith to move insurrection or re∣bellion
against them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain rea∣sons.</NOTE> And on the other part, the <HI>Greeks</HI> are
as unwiling to be industrious in Arts, Trafficke or Culti∣vage;
seeing what they possesse is not their owne, but is
taken from them at all occasions, with tyranny &amp; oppres∣sion.
For what gaines the sower, if another reape the pro∣fit?
So in the <HI>Ottomans</HI> estate, there be great Forrests, and
desartuous Countries; proceeding of the scarcity of peo∣ple
to inhabit there, the multitudes being drawn from <HI>A∣sia,</HI>
to strengthen the frontiers of his dominions in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="94"/>
And besides there is another reason of the dispopulo∣sity
of these parts▪ to wit, when the Great <HI>Turkes</HI> Army
is to march to a farre Country to make warres, then
must their vulgar subdued peasants, perhaps twenty or
thirty thousands go along with them, to carry their victu∣als,
and all manner of provision, being taken from the
plough, are constrained to this servitude, and notwith∣standing
the halfe of them never returne againe: Partly,
because of the change of food, and aire, and partly be∣cause
of their long travels and insupportable service, both
in heate and cold: And to these of the first reason, there
is an other perpendicular cause; to wit, that the whole
commerce of all commodiites in <HI>Turkey,</HI> is in the hands of
Iewes and Christians, to wit, <HI>Ragusans, Venetians, Eng∣lish,
French,</HI> and <HI>Flemmings,</HI> who so warily manage their
businesse, that they enjoy the most profits of any trading
there, dissappointing the <HI>Turkes</HI> owne subiects of their
due, and ordinary trafficke.</P>
<P>The last and most principall reason is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parcels of ground for <HI>Timariots.</HI></NOTE> which is a great
deale of more importance than his Revenues; to wit, the
great number of his <HI>Timars:</HI> for the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperours,
being immediate Maisters of the lands they ouercome,
they divide the same in <HI>Timars</HI> or commandements: lea∣ving
little or nothing at all to the ancient Inhabitants;
they dispose upon these proportions, to valorous Souldi∣ers,
that have done good service: And with this condi∣tion,
that they maintaine, and have alwayes in readinesse
Horses for the warres: which is an excellent good order
for the preservation of his Empire; for if these Timariots
were not rewarded, with such absolute possessions of par∣cell
grounds, the state of his power would suddenly runne
to ruine: for the profit of which lands, maintaining them∣selues,
their horses and their families, maketh them the
<PB N="167" REF="94"/>
more willing to concur in the infallible service of their
Emperour: These <HI>Timars</HI> or grounds, entertain through
all his Dominions, about two hundred and fifty thousand
horses, that are ever in readinesse to march at the first ad∣vertisement,
without any charge to the great Signior, be∣ing
bound to maintaine themselues in during the warres:
And yet these <HI>Timariots,</HI> and their horses cannot yearely
be maintained under the value of ten Millions of Gold:
The consideration whereof, makes me astonished, when I
recall, the relation of some ragged Authors, who dare
compare the great <HI>Turkes</HI> Revenues unto our petty
Princes of Christendome.</P>
<P>This establishment of <HI>Timars,</HI> and the by past election
of <HI>Azamglians,</HI> or young children to bee made <HI>Ianisaries</HI>
haue been the two strong Foundations, that supported so
inviolably the <HI>Turkes</HI> Empire. The <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours
for a long time vsed the selfe same manner for the assu∣ring
of their persons, and estate, in election of yong males
to be their guard. They were called the Pretorian Army,
and this taxation of children was the first thing that mo∣ved
the <HI>Flemmings,</HI> to revolt against the <HI>Romanes.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Turkish</HI> Cavalrie, they sustaine two impor∣tant
effects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Policies of <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> first they keepe under awe and subjection, the
great <HI>Turks</HI> subiects who otherwise perhaps wold teuolt:
And next they are ordained for any dependant interprise
for field Garrisons, yea, and the principall finewes of the
warres: and yet the election of the grand Signior, lieth
most in the hands of the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> who cannot perfect∣ly
say hee is Emperour before they confirme him in his
Throne.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkes</HI> have three things in their Armies which
are very fearefull, to wit, the infinite number of men,
great Discipline, and force of Munition: And for Disci∣pline,
<PB N="168" REF="95"/>
they are not onely gouerned with great silence, and
obedience, but they are ruled also with signes of the eye,
and being tractable, they are tied to main condusements:
And although their multitudes have often bred confusion
to them, so that little Armies have broke and overcome
them; yet in their flight they are so cautulous, that a small
number can do them no absolute violence nor finall over∣throw:
for as they assail, so they flie without feare.</P>
<P>The first Residence of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperour after his
comming from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> was at <HI>Priusa</HI> in <HI>Bythinia:</HI> thence
it was transported to <HI>Andreanople,</HI> and then to <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
where it abideth to this day: Besides, all his
great Bassaws in <HI>Europe,</HI> which are eight, one in <HI>Buda,</HI> in
<HI>Hungary,</HI> another in <HI>Moldavia,</HI> the third in <HI>Dacia,</HI> the
fourth at <HI>Bagaviliezza</HI> in <HI>Bosna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beglerb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs,</HI> or <HI>Bashaws.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. He hath also in <HI>Affrick</HI>
a Bassaw, in <HI>Algier,</HI> another in <HI>Tuneis,</HI> the third in <HI>Tripo∣lis,</HI>
and the fourth in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> &amp;c. And in <HI>Asia major,</HI> and
<HI>minor,</HI> to wit, one in <HI>Aleppo</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> one in <HI>Damascus,</HI>
another at <HI>Balsera,</HI> the fourth at <HI>Mecha</HI> in <HI>Arabia foelix,</HI>
the fift in <HI>Carmania,</HI> the sixt in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> the seventh in the
<HI>Rhodes,</HI> the eighth at <HI>Arzeron</HI> in <HI>Armenia major,</HI> the ninth
and tenth at <HI>Teslis</HI> &amp; <HI>Vpan,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Gurgestan</HI>
and <HI>Persia,</HI> &amp;c. For <HI>Arsenals</HI> hee hath foure for Sea, to wit,
one at <HI>Perah,</HI> or <HI>Galata,</HI> containing a hundred thirty and
three Galleys: The second at <HI>Gallipoli</HI> of twenty Galleys:
The third <HI>Arsenall</HI> is at <HI>Savezza</HI> upon the Red Sea, consi∣sting
of twenty five Galleys: And the fourth is at <HI>Belsara</HI>
in <HI>Arabia foelix,</HI> towards the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulfe, depending of
fifteene Galleys, which are kept there to afflict the <HI>Por∣tugals,</HI>
remaining in the Isle of <HI>Ormus;</HI> and other parts
adjacent there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have a custome, when they are Masters of
any Province, to extermine all the native Nobilitie,
<PB N="169" REF="95"/>
chiefly those of the blood Royall of the Country: And
neverthelesse they permit to all and every one of theirs to
live and follow his own Religion as hee pleaseth without
violence or constraint.</P>
<P>Amongst the <HI>Turkes</HI> there is no Gentilitie, nor Nobi∣litie,
but are all as ignoble and inferiour members, to one
mayne body the Great <HI>Turke,</HI> lineally descending of
the House of <HI>Ottoman:</HI> whose magnificence, puissance,
and power is such, that the most eloquent tongue cannot
sufficiently declare: His thousands of <HI>Ianizaries, Shouses,</HI>
and others daily attending him: which are the nerves and
sinews of the Warlike bodie of his whole Monarchy
and Imperiall Estate: His hundreds (besides his Queene)
of Concubines, hourely maintained by his means, and
monethly renewed: His Armies, <HI>Bashawes, Emeeres,
Vizier-bashawes, Sanzacks,</HI> Garrisons, and forces here
and there dispersed amongst his Dominions, would be
impossible for mee briefly to relate. The inhumane poli∣cie
of the <HI>Turks</HI> to avoid civill dissention is such, that
the seed of <HI>Ottoman</HI> (all except one of them) are strangled
to death: Wherefore, as <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> said of <HI>He∣rod</HI>
in the like case, It is better to be the Great <HI>Turkes</HI>
Dog, then his Sonne. His Daughters or Sisters are
not so used, but are given in Marriage to any <HI>Bassa,</HI>
whom so they affect; yet with this condition; the King
saith to his Daughter, or Sister, I give thee this man
to be thy slave; and if he offend thee in any case, or be dis∣obedient
to thy will, here I give thee a Dagger to cut off
his head; which always they weare by their sides for the
same purpose.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> differ much from the <HI>Turks,</HI> in nobilitie,
humanitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oble <HI>Per∣sians,</HI></NOTE> and activitie, and especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Re∣ligion:
who by contention thinke each other accursed,
<PB N="170" REF="96"/>
and notwithstanding both factions are under the <HI>Maho∣metanicall</HI>
Law. Neither are the sons of the <HI>Persian</HI> Kings,
so barbarously handled, as theirs; for all the brethren (one
excepted) are onely made blinde, wanting their eyes, and
are alwayes afterward gallantly maintained like Princes.
And it hath oftentimes faln out, that some of these Kings,
dying without procreate Heires; there have of these blind
sons succeeded to the Empire, who have restored again
the seed of that Royall Family.</P>
<P>And now▪ the great advantage, that the <HI>Turkes</HI> have
daily upon the <HI>Persians,</HI> is onely because of their Infan∣tery,
which the <HI>Persians</HI> no wayes are accustomed with,
fighting alwayes on Horse-back: neither are the <HI>Persi∣ans</HI>
adicted or given to build Forts, or Fortifications, nei∣ther
have they any great use of Munition, but exposing
themselves ever to the field in the extream hazard of bat∣tail,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Babylon</HI> regai∣ned by the <HI>Persians.</HI></NOTE>
become ever doubtfull in their victories: whose cou∣rage
and valour cannot be paraleld among all the people

may give sufficient testimony thereof.</P>

buriall of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> the Evangelist▪ It was said of this
place, in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apostles, that all <HI>Asia,</HI> and the

<HI>De natura Deorum,</HI> that <HI>Timaeus</HI> being demanded the
reason why the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> was set on fire that
night, when <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great was born: gave this
jest thereof, that the Mistris of it was from home; because
she being the Goddesse of Midwives, did that night wait
upon <HI>Olympias</HI> the mother of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, who
was brought to bed in <HI>Macedonia.</HI></P>
<P>Over against this Citie is the Isle <HI>Lango,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle <HI>Lan∣go,</HI> or <HI>Coos.</HI></NOTE> anciently
called <HI>Coos,</HI> wherein the great <HI>Hyppocrates</HI> was borne, and
<HI>Appelles,</HI> the Painter most excellent. It is both fertile,
and populous, and of circuit above fourescore miles.
There is a kinde of Serpent said to be in it, so friendly un∣to
the inhabitants, that when the men are sleeping under
the shadow of trees, they come crauling, and will linke
or claspe themselves about their necks and bodies, with∣out
doing any harme, neither when they awake are the
beasts affraid.</P>
<P>And neere to <HI>Lango,</HI> is the Isle <HI>Nixa</HI> of old <HI>Strangoli;</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="100"/>
and by some called <HI>Dionisa</HI> and <HI>Naxus,</HI> an Island both
fruitfull and delightfull. As we sailed by the west part of
the Isle, a <HI>Greekish</HI> passenger shewed mee the place,
where (as he said) <HI>Ariadne</HI> was deceived of <HI>Theseus,</HI>
which is not farre from the irriguate plaine of <HI>Dar∣mille.</HI></P>
<P>Continuing our Navigation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellent Swimmers.</NOTE> I saw the little Isle <HI>Eph∣dosh,</HI>
where the <HI>Turks</HI> told me, that all the Islanders
were naturally good swimmers, paying no more tribute
to their great Lord the <HI>Turke,</HI> save onely once in the yeare
there are certaine men and women chosen by a Turkish
Captaine, who must swimme a whole league right out in
the Sea, and goe downe to the bottome of the waters, to
fetch thence some token they have got ground: And if
they shall happen to faile in this, the Island will be redu∣ced
againe to pay him yearly rent. This I saw with mine
eyes, whiles we being calmed, there came a man, and two
women swimming to us, more than a mile of way, carry∣ing
with them (drye above the water) baskets of fruite
to sell, the which made me not a little to wonder. For
when they came to the ships side, they would neither
boord, nor boat with us, but lay leaning, or as it were re∣sting
themselves on the Sea, upon their one side, and sold
so their fruits, keeping Complements and discourses with
us above an houre. Contenting them for their ware,
&amp; a fresh gale arising, we set forward, accoasting the little
Isle of <HI>Samothracia.</HI></P>
<P>This Isle of <HI>Samothracia,</HI> was called of old <HI>Dardania,</HI>
and now by the <HI>Turks Samandracho;</HI> a place of small
note, considering the quantity of the Isle, &amp; the few num∣ber
of Inhabitants: their lives being answerable to their
meanes; ignorance and servitude, two strong comman∣ders
of infirme weaklings, and no lesse powerfull, than
<PB N="177" REF="100"/>
they are debile in the debt of worthines; which the yong∣lings
of understanding, and sucklings of far look'd to
knowledge, can never be able to escape, although a true
profession covereth many naturall imperfections; and in it
a hope for blessednesse, which indeed more wish for, then
rightly understand it. And upon the ninth day after our
departure from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> we arrived at the City of <HI>Rhodes,</HI>
so called of the Island wherein it standeth.</P>
<P><HI>Rhodes</HI> lieth in the <HI>Carpa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hian</HI> Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of <HI>Rhodes.</HI></NOTE> it was of old called
<HI>Ithrea, Telchino,</HI> and <HI>Phiula: Plinie</HI> saith it was called
<HI>Rhodes,</HI> because there were certain fields of Roses in it;
for <HI>Rhodos</HI> in the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue signifieth a <HI>Flowre:</HI> Not
far from the City, and at the entry of the Haven, I saw
the relicts of that huge, and admiredly erected Idoll, na∣med
<HI>Colossus Rhodius,</HI> or the mighty Image of the Sun;
which was made in honour thereof: from the which Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> termed the Inhabitants <HI>Colossians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Idoll <HI>Collossus.</HI></NOTE> It was builded by
the worthy <HI>Canete Lindo</HI> in the space of twelve yeares: o∣thers
have said, of <HI>Callasses</HI> the Disciple of <HI>Lisippus,</HI> ta∣king
the name <HI>Collossus</HI> of him, and it was thought wor∣thy
to be one of the seven earthly Wonders, and so it
might justly have beene: The quantity whereof (as yet)
may amaze the minde of the beholder: It was erected in
the Image of a man, being eighty Cubits high, and so
big that the little finger of it was as big as an ordinary
man: between whose legs, (it standing in the Harbours
mouth, with a leg on each side of the entery) Ships were
wont to passe under with taunt sails: When <HI>Mnavi</HI> Gene∣rall
of <HI>Caliph Osman</HI> first united this Isle to the <HI>Mahometan</HI>
Empire, and broke down the greatest part of this Statue▪
the brasse whereof was said to be so much that it loaded
nine hundred Camels.</P>
<P>This Isle belonged once to the Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> and
<PB N="178" REF="101"/>
were then sirnamed <HI>Knights of the Rhodes,</HI> but they
came first out of <HI>Acre</HI> in the Holy Land; who were cal∣led
<HI>Knights of St. Iohn;</HI> who viriliously expulsed the <HI>Sa∣razens</HI>
from thence, <HI>Anno</HI> 1308. who had formerly taken
it from the divided <HI>Grecians:</HI> These Knights sorely in
vested the <HI>Turkes</HI> for the space of two hundred yeares,
till <HI>Solyman</HI> the magnificent, at last invaded and subdued
it: The <HI>Rhodians</HI> were ever good freinds to the <HI>Romans,</HI>
in somuch that when all the other Mediterranean Islands
revolted to <HI>Mythridates</HI> of <HI>Pontus,</HI> this onely adhered to
the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>This Isle of <HI>Rhodes</HI> within the space of 25 yeares was
three times mightily indangered by violent and extreame
impetuosities of raine: in such sort that the last flood did
drowne the greatest part of the Inhabitants:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inundation of waters.</NOTE> which be∣ginning
in the Spring-time did continue to Summer, and
in all this time, it broke violently downe their houses, and
in the night killed the people lying in their beds; and in
the day time such as were sheltered under safegard of
their dwelling: which was a miserable destruction, and
the like of it scarcely heard of since the universall De∣luge.</P>
<P>But true it is, as these Ominous judgments falling upon
particular parts &amp; parcels of people are justly executed;
yet they serve for Caveats for all others in generall (sinne
being the originall of all) to take heed of offending the
Creator, in abusing the bestuse of the Creature.</P>
<P>The Citie of <HI>Rhodes</HI> hath two strong Fortresses, in
one of which these Knights (<HI>Lilladamus Villiers</HI> being
great Master, who were about five hundred onely, and
five thousand <HI>Rhodians</HI> who assisted them) were besie∣ged
by an Army of two hundred thousand <HI>Turkes,</HI> and
three hundred Galleys, for the space of sixe months. The
<PB N="179" REF="101"/>
chiefe obstacle, and impeaching of so great an Army
from taking it, was onely the resolute valour of the de∣fendants.
But in end, the multitude over-mastring valour,
and the <HI>Cavalieri di Rhodo,</HI> wanting furniture to their
Munition, and being penurious of victualls, were con∣strained
to render, upon the conditionall safety of their
lives, goods, and transportation; and remayned a long
time without any habitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rhodes</HI> take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by <HI>Solyman.</HI></NOTE> till the King of <HI>Spain</HI> gave
them the barren Isle of <HI>Malta</HI> to inhabit: This Isle of
<HI>Rhodes</HI> was lost by the <HI>Maltezes, Anno Domini</HI> 1522.
And on <HI>Christmas</HI> day <HI>Solyman</HI> entred the Towne as con∣querour,
though hee might justly have said (as <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>
once said of his victory over the <HI>Romans</HI>) that such
another victory would utterly have undone him; he lost
so many of his bravest Commanders, and best Soul∣diers.
It is ever since in the fruition of <HI>Turkes:</HI> The For∣tresse
of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and that Fortresse <HI>Famogusta,</HI> in <HI>Cyprus,</HI>
are the two strongest Holds, in all the Empire of the great
<HI>Turke.</HI></P>
<P>And by the way here I must record, that if the Great
<HI>Turke,</HI> and his great Counsell, were not good pay-masters
to their <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> and speedy rewarders of their com∣mon
Souldiers; it were impossible for him the Empe∣rour,
or them the <HI>Bassaws</HI> to manage so great a State, and
to keep under obedience so head-strong a multitude, and
such turbulent forces:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Souldiers should be re∣garded and rewarded.</NOTE> for by your leave, if a Souldi∣ers
industry be not quickned and animated with bounti∣full
rewards; hee hath lesse will to performe any part of
Martiall service; then a dead Coarse hath power to arise
out of the Grave: for what can be more precious to man,
then his blood, being the fountain and nurse of his vitall
spirits, and the ground of his bodily substance; which no
free or ingenious nature will hazard to lose for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="102"/>
And whosoever shall argument or discourse upon sound
reason, and infallible experience, may easily prove and
perceive, that these Commanders have ever best prospe∣red,
which have most liberally maintayned, and had in
singular regard, Military Arts and Souldiers; otherwise
the honourable mind, would account it a great deale bet∣ter
to have death without life, then life without reward:
yea, and the noble Commander, desiring rather to want,
then to suffer worth unrecompensed.</P>
<P><HI>Rhodes</HI> ioyneth near to the Continent, over against <HI>Ca∣ria,</HI>
now called <HI>Carmania,</HI> under which name the <HI>Turkes</HI>

Of which Towne also the Province tooke the name; for
<HI>Artemisia,</HI> who ayded <HI>Xerxes</HI> against the <HI>Grecians</HI> was

<P>After I had contented the master for my fraught and
victuals (who as he was an Infidell, used me with great
exaction) I found a Barke of the <HI>Arches</HI> purposed to <HI>Cy∣prus,</HI>

<P>The people are generally strong and nimble, of great
civility, hospitality to their neighbours, and exceedingly
affectionated to strangers. The second day after my arri∣vall,
I took with me an Interpreter, and went to see <HI>Nico∣sia,</HI>
which is placed in the midst of the Kingdome. But in
my journy thither, extream was the heat and thirst I endu∣red;
both in respect of the season, and also want of water▪
And although I had with me sufficiencie of wine, yet durst
I drinke none thereof, being so strong, and withall had a
taste of pitch; and that is, because they have no Barrels,
but great Jars made of earth, wherein their Wine is put.
And these Jars are all inclosed within the ground save
onely their mouthes, which stand alwayes open like to a
Source or Cistern; whose insides are all interlarded with
pitch to preserve the earthen Vessels unbroke asunder, in
regard of the forcible Wine; yet making the taste thereof
unpleasant to liquorous lips; and turneth the Wine, too
heady for the brain in digestion, which for health grow∣eth
difficult to strangers; and to themselves a swallowing

<P>The greatest imperfection of this Isle, is scarcity of

Robust Nature, and good Warriours, if they might carry
Armes: It is recorded, that in the time of <HI>Constantine</HI>

and that because it did not raine for the space of

yea, and would render the whole Signiory there∣of
to such a noble Actor. I do not see in that small judge∣ment,
which by experience I have got, but the redemp∣tion
of that Countrey where most facile; if that the gene∣rous
heart of any Christian Prince, would be moved with
condigne compassion to relieve the miserable afflicted In∣habitants.
In which worke hee should reape (question∣lesse)
not onely an infinite treasure of Worldly commo∣dities,
that followeth upon so great a conquest, but also
a heavenly and eternall reward of immortall glory. The
which deliverance <HI>Ferdinando</HI> Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> thought
to have accomplished (having purchased the good will of
the Islanders) with five <HI>Gallounes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Floren∣tines</HI> attemp∣ted to conquer <HI>Cyprus.</HI></NOTE> and 5000 Souldiers:
Who being mindfull to take first in the fortresse of <HI>Famo∣gusta,</HI>
directed so their course, that in the night, they
should hate entred the Haven, disbarke their men, and
scale the walles.</P>
<P>But in this plot they were farre disappointed by an un∣happy
Pilot of the Vice-admiral, who mistaking the Port,
went into a wrong Bay: which the <HI>Florentines</HI> conside∣ring,
resolved to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturne, and keepethe sea, till the second
night; but by a dead calme, they were frustrated of their
aymes, and on the morrow discovered by the Castle:
Whereupon the <HI>Turkes</HI> went presently to armes, &amp; char∣ged
the Inhabitants to come to defend that place: But a∣bout
foure hundred <HI>Greekes</HI> in the westpart, at <HI>Paphus,</HI>
rebelled; thinking that time had altered their hard for∣tunes,
by a new change: but alas, they were preuented, &amp;
every one cut off by the bloody hands of the <HI>Turks.</HI> this
massacre was committed in the year 1607. Such alwayes
are the torturing flames of <HI>Fortunes</HI> smiles, that he who
most affecteth her, she most and altogether deceiveth:
But they who trust in the Lord, shall be as stable as Mount
<PB N="188" REF="106"/>
<HI>Sion,</HI> which cannot be removed; and questionlesse, one
day God, in his all eternall mercie, will relieve their
miseries, and in his just iudgments, recompence these
bloody oppressors with the heavy vengance of his all-seeing
Justice.</P>
<P>In my returne from <HI>Nicosia,</HI> to <HI>Famogusta,</HI> with my
Trench-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, wee encountred by the way with foure
<HI>Turkes,</HI> who needs would have my Mule to ride upon;
which my Interpreter refused: But they in a revenge,
pulled mee by the heels from the Mules backe, beating
mee most pittifully, and left mee almost for dead. In
this meanewhile my companion fled, and escaped the
sceleratnesse of their hands; and if it had not beene for
some compassionable <HI>Greeks,</HI> who by accident came by,
and relieved me, I had doubtlesse immediately perished.</P>
<P>Here I remember betwene this Isle and <HI>Sydon</HI> that
same Summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sea combat</NOTE> there were five galleouns of the Duke of
<HI>Florence,</HI> who encountred by chance the <HI>Turkes</HI> great
<HI>Armado</HI> confisting of 100 gallees, 14 galleots, and two
Galleasses: The Admirall of which Ships did single <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
her selfe from the rest, and offered to fight with the whole
<HI>Armado</HI> alone; but the <HI>Turkes</HI> durst not, and in their fly∣ing
backe, the Admirall sunke two of their gallies; and
had almost seized upon one of their galleasses, if it had
not beene for 20 Gallies, who desperately adventured to
tow her away against the wind and so escaped.</P>
<P>For true it is, the naturall <HI>Turkes</HI> were never skilfull
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anaging of Sea battells, neither are they expert Ma∣riners▪
nor experimented Gunners, if it were not for our
Christian Runnagates, <HI>French, English,</HI> and <HI>Flemings,</HI> and
they too sublime, accurate, and desperate fellows, who
have taught the <HI>Turkes</HI> the art of navigation and especi∣ally
the use of munition which they both cast to them, &amp;
<PB N="189" REF="106"/>
then become their chief Cannoneers; the <HI>Turks</HI> would be
as weak and ignorant at Sea, as the silly <HI>Aethiopian</HI> is un∣expert
in handling of Arms on the Land. For the private
humour of discontented Cast-awayes is always an enemy
to publick good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christian Runnagates.</NOTE> who from the society of true Believers,
are driven to the servitude of Infidels, and refusing the
bridle of Christian correction, they receive the double
yoke of despair and condemnation. Whose terrour of a
guilty conscience, or rather blazing brand of their vexed
souls in forsaking their Faith, and denying Christ to be
their Saviour, ramverts most of them, either over in a tor∣ment
of melancholy, otherwise in the extasie of madnes:
which indeed is a torturing horrour, that is sooner felt
then known; and cannot be avoided by the rudenesse of
Nature, but by the saving grace of true felicity.</P>
<P>From the Fort and Citie <HI>Famogusta,</HI> I imbarked in a
<HI>Germo,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Tripoly,</HI> being 88 miles distant,
where I met with an <HI>English</HI> Ship called the Royall Ex∣change
of <HI>London,</HI> lying there at Anchor in the dangerous
Road of <HI>Tripoly,</HI> whose loves I cannot easily forget, for at
my last good night, being after great cheare, and grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
carousing, they gave mee the thundring farewell of three
peeces of Ordnance.</P>
<P><HI>Tripoly</HI> is a City in <HI>Syria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citie of <HI>Tripolie.</HI></NOTE> standing a mile from the Ma∣rine
side, neer to the foot of Mount <HI>Libanus:</HI> since it hath
beene first founded, it hath three times beene situated,
and removed in three sundry places: First, it was over∣whelmed
with water: Secondly, it was sacked with <HI>Cur∣sares,</HI>
and Pirates: Thirdly, it is like now to be over∣throwne
with new made Mountaines of sand: There is
no Haven by many miles neare unto it, but a dangerous
Road, where often when Northerly windes blow, Ships
are cast away.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="107"/>
The great Traffick which now is at this place, was for∣merly
at <HI>Scanderona</HI> or <HI>Alexandretta,</HI> a little more East∣ward;
but by reason of the infectious aire, that corrupted
the bloud of strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI></NOTE> proceeding of two high Moun∣tains;
who are supposed to be a part of Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI>
which with-hold the prospect of the Sunne from the In∣dwellers,
more then three houres in the morning. So that
in my knowledge, I have knowne die in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne Ship, in
a moneths time, twenty Mariners: for this cause the
Christian Ships were glad to have their Commodities
brought to <HI>Tripoly,</HI> which is a more wholsome and con∣venient
place.</P>
<P>The daily interrogation I had here, for a Carravans
departure to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> was not to me a little fastidious, be∣ing
mindfull to visit <HI>Babylon:</HI> In this my expectation I
took purpose, with three <HI>Venetian</HI> Merchants, to goe see
the Cedars of <HI>Libanon,</HI> which was but a dayes journey
thither. As wee ascended upon the Mountaine, our igno∣rant
Guide mistaking the way, brought us in a Labyrinth
of dangers; insomuch that wrestling amongst intricate
paths of Rocks: two of our Asses fell over a banke, and
broke their necks: And if it had not been for a <HI>Christian
Amaronite,</HI> who accidently encountred with us, in our
wilesome wandring, we had been miserably lost: both in
regard of Rocks, and heaps of snow we passed; and also
of great Torrents, which fell down with force, from the
steepy tops: wherein one of these Merchants was twice
almost drowned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cedars of <HI>Liba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.</HI></NOTE> When wee arrived to the place where
the Cedars grew, we saw but twenty foure of all, grow∣ing
after the manner of Oke-trees, but a great deal taller,
straighter, and greater, and the branches grow so
straight, and interlocking as though they were kept by
Art. And yet from the Root to the top they beare
<PB N="191" REF="107"/>
no boughes, but grow straight upwards, like to a Palme-tree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
who as may-poles invelope the ayre, so their circle
spred tops do kisse or embrace the lower cloudes; making
their grandure over-look the highest bodies of all other
aspiring trees: and like Monarchall Lions to wild beasts,
they become the chiefe Champions of Forrests and
Woods.</P>
<P>Although that in the dayes of <HI>Salomon,</HI> this mountaine
was over-clad with Forrests of Cedars yet now there are
but onely these, and nine miles Westward thence, seven∣teene
more. The nature of that tree is alwayes greene,
yeelding an odoriferous smell, and an excellent kind of
fruite like unto Apples, but of a sweter taste, and more
wholesome in digestion. The Rootes of some of these
Cedars are almost destroyed by Shepheards, who have
made fires thereat, and holes wherein they sleepe; yet
neverthelesse they flourish greene above in the tops, and
branches. The length of this mountaine is about forty
miles reaching from the West to the East: and continu∣ally,
Summer and Winter reserveth Snow on the tops.
It is also beautified with all the ornaments of nature, as
Herbage, Tillage, Pastorage, Fructiferous Trees, fine
Fountaines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Liba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></NOTE> good Cornes, and absolutely the best Wine
that is bred on the earth. The Signior thereof is a Free-holder,

fled into <HI>Italy</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Florence:</HI> And notwith∣standing
that the elder brother yeelded up <HI>Sydon,</HI> and be∣came
a pardond subject to the great <HI>Turke:</HI> yet this the o∣ther
brother would neuer yeeld nor surrender, himselfe,
the Fort, nor the Signiory of <HI>Libanus:</HI> The old Prince
<PB N="192" REF="108"/>
his father after two yeares exile, was restored againe to
his Emperours favour; with whom in my second Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>els,

as I shall make more cleer afterwards.</P>
<P>The most part of the inhabited Villages are Christians,
called <HI>Amaronites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>torians.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Nostranes, quasi Nazaritans,</HI> and

of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is written. The kinde <HI>Amaronite</HI> whom
wee met, and tooke with us for our best guide, in descen∣ding
from the Cedars: shewed us many Caves and Holes
in Rocks, where <HI>Coliers,</HI> religious <HI>Syriens</HI> and <HI>Amaro∣nites</HI>
abide: among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t these austere Cottages, I saw a faire

who conducted the people of <HI>Israel</HI> to the land of Pro∣mise.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> esteeme this to be a holy place, and

prayers to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> I saw upon this Mountaine, a sort of

<P>The Patriarch did most kindly entertaine us at his
house; so did also all the <HI>Amaronites</HI> of the other Villa∣ges,

<P>About the Village of <HI>Eden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Nestorian</HI> Paradic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> is the most fruitfull part
of all <HI>Libanus,</HI> abounding in all sorts of delicious fruits.
True it is, the varietie of these things, maketh the silly
people thinke, the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> was there: By which
allegeance, they approve the apprehension of such a si∣nistrous
opinion with these arguments, that Mount <HI>Li∣banus</HI>
is sequestra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om the circumjacent Regions, and
is invincible for the height, and strengths they have in
Rocks; and that <HI>Eden</HI> was still re-edified by the fugitive
Inhabitants, when their enemies had ransacked it: Also
they affirme before the Deluge it was so nominate, and
after the Flood it was repaired again by <HI>Iaphet,</HI> the sonne
of <HI>Noah,</HI> who builded <HI>Ioppa,</HI> or <HI>Iaphta</HI> in <HI>Palestina.</HI> Loe,
there are the reasons they shew strangers for such like in∣formations.</P>
<P>There are with this one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Georgian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dice.</NOTE> other two supposed places of
the earthly Paradice; The one is by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and some
ignorant <HI>Georgians,</HI> holden to beat <HI>Damascus,</HI> for the
beauty of fair fields, gardens, and excellent fruits there;
especially for the Tree called <HI>Mouflee,</HI> which they be∣lieve
<PB N="195" REF="109"/>
hath grown there since the beginning of the World.
Indeed it is a rare and singular Tree, for I saw it at <HI>Damas∣cus,</HI>
and others also of the same kinde, upon <HI>Nylus</HI> in <HI>Ae∣gypt:</HI>
The growth whereof is strange: for every yeare in
<HI>September</HI> it is cut downe hard by the root, and in five
moneths the Tree buddeth up a pace again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tree <HI>Mouf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></NOTE> bringing forth
leaves, flowres and fruit. The leafe thereof is of such a
breadth, that three men may easily stand under the shadow
of it, and the Apple is bigger then a football, which is
yeerly transported for <HI>Constantinople</HI> to the Great <HI>Turke;</HI>
and there is reserved for a Relict of the fruit of the forbid∣den
Tree: whence he surstiles himself keeper of the earth∣ly
Paradice.</P>
<P>But if he were not surer a greater Commander and Re∣server
of a large part, of the best bosome of the earth, than
he is Keeper of that <HI>Adamian</HI> Garden; his stiles of the
Earth, and mine of the World, were both alike, and that
were just nothing, save onely this, two naked creatures li∣ving
amongst naked people: or otherwise, if it were to
be kept or seen, certainly I would wish to be a <HI>Postillion,</HI>
to the great Porter, the <HI>Turk,</HI> but not his <HI>Pedagog,</HI> farre

<P>The third place by these <HI>Chelfaines,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>belfain</HI> Paradice.</NOTE> is thought to be
in the East part of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> neere to the joyning of
<HI>Tygris,</HI> and <HI>Euphrates;</HI> where, so they inhabit: I have
oft required of these <HI>Chelfaines,</HI> what reason they had
for this conceived opinion: who answered mee, they re∣ceived
it from time to time, by the tradition of their An∣cestors:
And because of the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and other
Rivers mentioned in the Scriptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which to this day,
detain their names in that Countrey. Some hold,
that Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> extended over all the Earth. But
contrariwise, it manifestly appeareth by the second
<PB N="196" REF="110"/>
Chapter of <HI>Genesis</HI> 2. 20. that this Garden, which we call
Paradice, wherein <HI>Adam</HI> was put to dresse it, was a cer∣tain
place on earth, containing a particular portion of a
Country, called <HI>Eden,</HI> which boundeth on the River <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣phrates.</HI>
To this, and all the rest, I answer, no certainty
can be had of the place where <HI>Eden</HI> was, either by reading
or travelling, because this River hath been oft divided in
sundry streams: And it is said, that <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when he wonne
<HI>Babylon,</HI> did turn the main channell of <HI>Euphrates</HI> to ano∣ther
course. But howsoever, or wheresoever it be, I resolve
my self, no man can demonstrate the place, which God for
the sins and fall of man, did not onely accurse; but also the
whole face of the Earth.</P>
<P>Many ancient Authors have agreed with the opinion of
<HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> constantly affirming, that Mountains,
Islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence of seas &amp; waters.</NOTE> and Countries, have received great alteration by
the inundation of Rivers, and violence of raging Seas.
<HI>Thracia,</HI> hath beene divided from <HI>Bythinia, Nigroponti,</HI>
from <HI>Thessalia: Corfu,</HI> from <HI>Epire: Sycilia,</HI> from <HI>Italie:</HI>
The Isles <HI>Orcades,</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and many other Islands,
and Countries cut through so in divisions after the same
forme. Wherefore the more a man contemplate to search
the knowledge of <HI>Eden,</HI> and such high mysteries (apper∣taining
only to the Creator) the more hee shall faile in his
purpose, offend God, become foolish, and fantasticall for
his pains.</P>
<P>But to turne backe to mine itinerary relation, after my
returne to <HI>Tripoly,</HI> I departed thence Eastward, with a
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aravan</HI> of <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kes</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> being ten days journey
distant. In all this way (leaving <HI>Scanderon</HI> on our left
hand) I saw nothing worthy remarking; save onely a few
scattered Villages, and poore miserable people called
<HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcomanni,</HI> living in Tents, and following their flocks
<PB N="197" REF="110"/>
to whom I payed sundry <HI>Caffars</HI> who remove their wo∣men,
children, and cattle where so they finde fountaines,
and good pastorage: like unto the custome of the ancient
<HI>Israelites:</HI> Which in their vagabonding fashion, did
plainly demonstrate the necessitie they had to live, ra∣ther
then any pleasure they had, or could have in their li∣ving.</P>
<P>They differ also in Religion from all the other <HI>Maho∣metans</HI>
in two damnable points:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Turco∣mans</HI> opinion of God and the Devill,</NOTE> The one is, they acknow∣ledge,
that there is a God, and that hee of himselfe is so
gracious, that hee neither can, being essentially good doe
harm, nor yet will authorize any ill to be done, and there∣fore
more to beloved than feared: The other is, they con∣fesse
there is a Devill, and that hee is a Tormentor of all
evill doers: and of himselfe so terrible and wicked, that
they are contented even for acquisting his favour and
kindnesse, to sacrifice in fire their first-born child to him:
soliciting his devillishnesse, not to torment them too sore
when they shall come into his hands: And yet for all this,
they think afterwards by the mercy of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> they shall
go from Hell to Paradice.</P>
<P>In this immediate or aforesaid passage, wee coasted
neere and within six miles of the limits of <HI>Antiochia,</HI>
one of the ancient Patriarch Seas;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Antiochi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> the first <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI></NOTE> so called of <HI>Antiochus</HI>

all which Massacres and Martyrdome, yet this
little graine of Mustard seed, planted by Gods owne
hand, and watered with the blood of so many holy Saints,
(<HI>Nam sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiae est</HI>) grew so great
a tree, that the branches thereof were dispersed through
every City, and Province of the whole World.</P>
<P>Before my arrivall in <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the <HI>Caravan</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI>
was from thence departed, which bred no small griefe in
my brest: The <HI>Venetian</HI> Consul, to whom I was highly

some insight of my intended Voyage) informed me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frustrate of <HI>Babylon.</HI></NOTE> that

and <HI>Chelfaine,</HI> a Province of the same, joyning
with <HI>Tygris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and returning the same way

The people here are for the most part believers in

And yet though without learning, or great under∣standing
therein, they are wonderfull zealous in their pro∣fession,
and great sufferers for it also.</P>

from whence North-east, and not far hence are the demo∣lished

This Country of <HI>Chelfaine,</HI> is the place most agreeable

<P><HI>Mesopotamia</HI> is seldome watered with raine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mesopotamia.</HI></NOTE> but by the

with <HI>Caldea,</HI> on the East: <HI>Euphrates</HI> on the South: <HI>Syria</HI> on
the North: and <HI>Arabia Petrea</HI> on the West. This <HI>Aleppo</HI> is
a City in <HI>Syria;</HI> the name of which hath been so oft chan∣ged
by <HI>Turks,</HI> that the true antiquitie of it, can hardly be
known: It is both large and populous, and furnished with
all sorts of Merchandize, especially of Indigo, and Spi∣ces,
that are brought over land from <HI>Goa,</HI> and other pla∣ces
in <HI>India,</HI> which draweth a concurrance of all Nations
to it.</P>
<P>Here I remember of a notable obedience done to the
Great <HI>Turke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A notable obedience.</NOTE> by the Great <HI>Bassaw</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who was also
an <HI>Emeere,</HI> or hereditary Prince: to wit, the yeere before
my comming hither, hee had revolted against his Empe∣rour,
and fighting, the <HI>Bassaws</HI> of <HI>Damascus,</HI> and <HI>Carahe∣men,</HI>
overcame them: The yeare following, and in my
being there, the Grand <HI>Signior</HI> sent from <HI>Constantinople</HI>
a <HI>Showse,</HI> and two <HI>Ianizaries</HI> in Ambassage to him: where,
when they came to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> the <HI>Bassaw</HI> was in his owne
Countrey at <HI>Mesopotamia:</HI> The Messengers make haste
after him, but in their journey they met him comming
back to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> accompanied with his two sonnes, and
sixe hundred Horsmen. Upon the high way they delive∣red
their message, where hee stood still, and heard them:
The proffer of <HI>Achm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> was, that if hee would acknow∣ledge
his Rebellion, and for that Treason committed
send him his Head, his eldest Son should both inherit his
possessions, and <HI>Bassawship</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> otherwise he would
<PB N="202" REF="113"/>
come with great forces in all expedition, and in his pro∣per
person he would utterly raze him and all his, from the
face of the earth.</P>
<P>At which expression, the <HI>Bassaw</HI> knowing that hee was
not able to resist the invincible Army of his Master, and
his owne presence, hee dismounted from his Horse, and
went to counsell with his sonnes, and neerest friends:
where hee, and they concluded, it was best for him to die,
being an old man, to save his Race undestroyed, and to
keepe his son in his authoritie and inheritance: This
done, the <HI>Bassaw</HI> went to prayer, and taking his leave
of them all, sate down upon his knees, where the <HI>Showse</HI>
strook off his head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bassaw of <HI>Aleppo</HI> be∣headed.</NOTE> putting it in a Box, to carry it with
him for <HI>Constantinople.</HI> The dead corps were carried to
<HI>Aleppo</HI> and honorably buried, for I was an eye witnesse to
that Funeral Feast: And immediatly, therafter, the <HI>Showse</HI>
by Proclamation and power from the Emperour, fully
possessed the sonne in his Fathers Lands, Offices, <HI>Bassaw∣ship,</HI>
and the authoritie of all the Easterne <HI>Syria,</HI> part
of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> and the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Countrey; for this <HI>Bas∣saw</HI>

of all the other <HI>Bassaws</HI> in the <HI>Turkes</HI> Dominions; ex∣cept
the <HI>Bassa,</HI> or <HI>Beglerbeg</HI> of <HI>Damascus;</HI> and yet the for∣mer
in Hereditary power, farre exceedeth the other; be∣ing

<P>In my expectation here, and the Spring come, (being
disappointed of me desired aimes) I pretended to visite
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> in my back-comming; and for the furtherance
of my determination, I joyned with a <HI>Caravan</HI> of <HI>Arme∣nians,</HI>
and <HI>Turks</HI> that were well guarded with <HI>Ianisa∣ries,</HI>
and Souldiers; of whom some were to stay at <HI>Da∣mascus</HI>
by the way, and some mindful to the furthest
marke. And for my better safeguard (being always alone
which by all, was ever much admired) the <HI>Venetian</HI> Con∣sull
tooke surety of the Captaine that hee should protect

tributes by the way, delivering me freely into the hand
of the <HI>Padre Guardiano</HI> at <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> Which being done, I
I hired a Mule from a <HI>Turke,</HI> to carry my victuals, and so
set forward with them. The number of our company
were about 600 <HI>Armenians, Christian</HI> Pilgrimes, men
and women: 600 <HI>Turkes</HI> trafficking for their owne bu∣sinesse,
and 100 souldiers three <HI>Showsses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Caravan of <HI>Armenians.</HI></NOTE> and sixe <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ani∣zaries,</HI>
to keep them from invasions.</P>
<P>Betweene <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Damascus,</HI> wee had nine dayes
journey, in five of which, we had pleasant travelling, and
good <HI>Canes</HI> to lodge in, that had bin builded for the
support of Travellers; and are well maintained: But
when we passed <HI>Hamsek,</HI> which is a little more then mid∣way,
we had dangerous travelling, being oft assailed with
<HI>Arabs,</HI> fatigated with Rocky Mountaines, and some∣times
in point of choaking for lacke of water. The
confusion of this multitude, was not onely grievous in
regard of the extreame heate, providing of victuals at
poore Villages, and scarcity of water, to fill our bottles,
made of Boare-skinnes; but also amongst narrow and
stony passages, thronging, we oft fell one over another
in great heapes; in danger to be smothered; yea; and of∣tentimes
we that were Christians, had our bodies well
beaten, by our couducting <HI>Turkes.</HI> In this iourneying I
remember the <HI>Turke</HI> who ought my Mule, was for three
dayes exceeding favourable unto me, in so much, that I
began to doubt of his carriage, fearefully suspecting the
Italian Proverb.</P>

But when I perceived, his extraordinary service and flat∣tery,
was onely to have a share of the Tobacco I carried
with me, I freely bestowed a pound there of upon him:
Which he and his fellowes tooke as kindly, as though it
had been a pound of gold, for they are excessively addict∣ted
to smoake, as <HI>Dutch</HI> men are to the Pot: which ever
made me to carry Tobacco with me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pagan flattery</NOTE> to acquist their fa∣vour,
over and above their fials, more then ever I did for
my owne use: for in these dayes I took none at all; though
now as time altereth every thing, I am (<HI>Honoris Gratia</HI>)
become a courtly Tobacconist; more for fashion then for
liking: The <HI>Turkish</HI> Tobacco pipes are more than a yard
long and commonly of Wood or Canes, beeing joyned
in three parts, with Lead or white Iron; their severall
mouths receiving at once, a whole ounce of Tobacco;
which lasteth a long space, and because of the long pipes,
the smoak is exceeding cold in their swallowing throats.</P>
<P>At our accustomed dismounting to recreate our selues,
and refresh the beasts, I would often fetch a walke, to
stretch my legs, that were stiffed with a stumbling beast;
wherewith the <HI>Turkes</HI> were mightily discontented, and in
derision would laugh, and mocke me: For they cannot
abide a man to walke in turnes, or stand to eate; their
usage being such that when they come from the horse
backe, presently sit downe on the ground, folding their
feete under them, when they repose, dine, and sup. So
doe also their Artizans and all the <HI>Turkes</HI> in the World
sit all wayes crosse legged, wrongfully abusing the com∣mondable
consuetude of the industrious Tailors. In their
houses they have no bed to lye on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chaire to sit on, nor
table to eate on, but a bench made of boords along the
house side, of a foot high from the floore spred over with
<PB N="206" REF="115"/>
a Carpet; whereon they usually sitting eating, drinking,
sleeping, resting, and doing of manuall exercises, all in one
place. Neither will the best sort of <HI>Mahometans,</HI> be na∣med
<HI>Turks,</HI> because it signifieth banished in the <HI>Hebrew</HI>
tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turks</HI> are cal∣led <HI>Musilmans.</HI></NOTE> and therefore they call themselves <HI>Musilmans,</HI>
to wit, good believers: where in deed for good, it is a false
Epithite, but certainly for firm believers they are wonder∣full
constant; and so are all ignorants of whatsoever pro∣fession:
even like to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who in the midst of all
his evils, yet he remayneth alwayes fidele to all the usur∣pations,
the <HI>Hispanicall</HI> Crown can compasse.</P>
<P>They never unclothe themselves when they go to rest,
neither have they any bed-clothes, save onely a coverlet

lie ranked like durty Swine, in a beastly stie, or loth∣some

<P>Upon the ninth day (leaving <HI>Cotafa</HI> behinde us on the

of length, adorned with many Villages, Gardens, and
Rivers; and arriving at <HI>Damascus,</HI> wee were all lodged
(some in Chambers wanting beds, and others without,

part of <HI>Galilee,</HI> which is the beginning of <HI>Canaan:</HI> two
of which three, we encountred with marishes and quag∣mires,
being a great hinderance to us: This barren, and
marish Countrie, is a part of <HI>Arabia Petrea,</HI> comming in
with a point between <HI>Galilee,</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> running along
even to the South-west skirt of <HI>Libanus,</HI> which indeed
in that place, farre more than <HI>Iordan</HI> divideth the true
<HI>Syria</HI> from <HI>Canaan;</HI> this Petrean Countrey it selfe, de∣valling
even downe to the limits of <HI>Iacobs</HI> bridge, cut∣teth
away the denomination of <HI>Syria,</HI> from this parcell
of ground, till you come Eastward to the more laborious
Plains.</P>
<P>Through this passage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dangerous way.</NOTE> it is most undoubtedly a very
theevish way; for as we travelled in the night there were
many of us forced to carry burning lights in our hands,
&amp; our souldiers had their Harquebuzes ready to discharge:
all to affray the blood-thirsty <HI>Arabians,</HI> who in holes,
caves, and bushes, lie obscured, waiting for the advantage
upon Travellers: not unlike unto the Lawlesse Wood-Karnes
in <HI>Ireland.</HI> This part of <HI>Arabia</HI> is called <HI>Petrosa,</HI> be∣cause
it is so rockie, and some thinke of <HI>Petra</HI> the chiefe
Towne: It was anciently divided into regions <HI>Nabathia,</HI>
and <HI>Agara,</HI> possessed first by the <HI>Hagarens,</HI> discended of
<HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Hagar:</HI> It is also thought to be the land of
the <HI>Midianites</HI> whither <HI>Moses</HI> fled to, and kept sheep, and
Mount <HI>Horeb</HI> is here, whereon the Lord did shew him
the land of Promise.</P>

Divers of the <HI>Petrean Arabs,</HI> converse and dwell amongst
the <HI>Turks;</HI> whom we tearm in respect of the other, civill
<HI>Arabs.</HI> South from hence, lieth <HI>Arabia Foelix</HI> bordering
with the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea; which is the most fruitfull and plea∣sant
soyle in all <HI>Asia;</HI> abounding with <HI>Balsome, Myrrhe,</HI> and
<HI>Frankincense, Gold</HI> and <HI>Pearls,</HI> especially about <HI>Medina,</HI> the
second City to <HI>Meccha:</HI> The other Towns of note are <HI>Ho∣ran,</HI>
the chiefe Port of the South Ocean. And <HI>Alteroch,</HI> the
only Towne where Christians are in greatest number in
that Country.</P>
<P>Truly with much difficulty and greater danger passed
we these <HI>Petrean</HI> journeys.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabia Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ea▪</NOTE> Here I remarked a singular qua∣lity,
and rare perfection, in the carefull conduction of our
Captaine; who would, when wee came to any dangerous
place, give the wat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h-word of S. <HI>Ioanne,</HI> meaning as much
thereby, that none should speak or whisper after that war∣ning
under the pain of a <HI>Harquebusado.</HI> And no more wee
durst, unlesse hee had stretcht out his hand, making us a
signe (when occasion served) of liberty, lest by our tumul∣tuous
noise in the night, our enemies should have the fore∣knowledge
of our comming; and knowing also that the
nature of a multitude, bred all times confused effects, with∣out
some severe punishment. Himself rode still in the Van∣gard,
upon a lusty Gelding, with two <HI>Ianizaries</HI> and forty
Souldiers, and the other foure <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> and sixtie
Souldiers, were appointed to be the backgard, for feare of
sudden assaults. Thus most dexteriously discharged he the
function of his calling, not with insolencie, but with pru∣dent
and magnanimous virility: for my part, I must needs
say, the diligent care of that benigne Caravan extended
over mee, was such, that whensoever I remember it, I am
not able to sacrifice congratulations sufficiently to his
<PB N="212" REF="118"/>
wel-deserving minde: yet in the meane while, my Purse
bountifully rewarded his earnest endevours; and notwith∣standing,
of this high conceived regard, yet in some fri∣volous
things, and for a small trifle, he privatly wronged
me, which I misknew, as unwilling (knowing his disposi∣tion,
and that my life hung in his hands) to be too for∣ward
too seek a redresse. For often times an inconvenience
is most convenient; and as the great corrupter of youth
is pleasure, and the violent enemy of age is griefe; even so
are the inordinate desires of inconscionable strangers to∣ward
Travellers, who preferring avarice above honesty,
care onely for that part of a man which is his fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town of <HI>Sarepta.</HI></NOTE>
whose friendship beginning onely in an outward show,
must end in the midst of a mans money; as who would say,
such like were rather employed, as their employments re∣warded,
and therefore in unlawfull things they must suck
the honey of their owne preposterous ends: And thus it
fared with him, at the paying of my Tributes, by the way
for my head, he caused mee oft to pay, more then reason,
to the <HI>Moores, Turks,</HI> and civill <HI>Arabs,</HI> receiving secretly
back from them the overplus; which my Turkish Servant
perceiving, made my Trenchman tell me, that I might be
before seene therein.</P>
<P>But such is the covetous nature of man, that with
his covenant hee cannot be contented, unlesse hee seeke
otherwise, by all unlawfull meanes to purchase him∣selfe
an unjust gaine: But the high respect I had of his
other perfections, made mee oversee and winke at that
imperfection of avaritiousnesse in him; and especially,
remembring my selfe to be under his protection, I al∣ways
endevoured my aymes so, that in his sight I wonne
extraordinary favour: insomuch, that in danger, or se∣curitie,
<PB N="213" REF="118"/>
he would euer have me neere by him, which I
also craved, and strove to observe the points of his will,
and my owne safety.</P>
<P>The obligation of my bounden duety, taught me to
no other end, then ever to respect the benevolence of his
his affection, and to suppresse my own weake judgement,
which could never mount to the true acquittance of his
condigne merit.</P>
<P>But to proceed in my Pilgrimage, on the aforesaid
third day, in the after-noone, we entred in <HI>Galilee</HI> pas∣sing
along a faire Bridge that is over the River <HI>Iordain,</HI>
which divideth a part of this stony <HI>Arabia</HI> from <HI>Galilee.</HI>
This Bridge by the <HI>Armenians,</HI> is called <HI>Iacobs</HI> Bridge;
and not farre hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iacobs</HI> Bridge▪</NOTE> they shewed me the place, where
<HI>Iacob</HI> wrestled with the Angell, and where <HI>Esau</HI> met
his brother <HI>Iacob,</HI> to have killed him being upon the
East side of the River: <HI>Iordain</HI> is scarcely known by the
name in this place: but afterward I saw his greater
growth, ending in <HI>Sodome</HI> whereof in the owne place, I
shall more simply discourse: between <HI>Iacobs</HI> Bridge and
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> we had sixe dayes journey, five whereof were
more pleasant than profitable, in regard of the great tri∣butes
I payd by the way for my head, that at sundry places
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d into one day, I have payd for my freedome in passage
twel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Chickens of gold, amounting to five pounds eight
shillings of English money: A journall tribute more fit
for a Prince to pay, than a Pilgrime; the admiration one∣ly
resting upon this, how I was furnished with these
great moneyes I dayly disbursed.</P>
<P><HI>Aprill</HI> the eighteene day, according to the computa∣tion
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Callender, and by ours, <HI>March</HI> the
eight and twenty, I entred in <HI>Gallilee,</HI> a Province of <HI>Cana∣an;</HI>
this Country was first called <HI>Canaan</HI> from <HI>Canan</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="119"/>
the sonne of <HI>Cham:</HI> secondly, the <HI>Land of Promise,</HI> because
it was promised by the Lord to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his seed to
possesse: Thirdly, the land of <HI>Israel,</HI> of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> so cal∣led
from <HI>Iacob,</HI> who was sirnamed <HI>Israel:</HI> Fourthly, <HI>Iu∣dea,</HI>
from the <HI>Iews,</HI> or the people of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah:</HI>
Fifthly, <HI>Palestine quasi Philistim,</HI> the land of the <HI>Philistims.</HI>
And now sixtly, <HI>terra sancta,</HI> the holy Land, because here∣in
was wrought many wonderfull miracles, but especially
the work of our salvation. It is in length 180, and in
breadth 60 miles: yet of that salubrity of aire and fertility
of soile flowing with Milke and Honey that before the
comming of the <HI>Israelites</HI> it maintained thirty Kings,
with their people, and afterward the two potent King∣domes
of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Iudah;</HI> in which <HI>David</HI> numbred one
million and three hundred thousand fighting men, besides
them of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin</HI> and <HI>Levi:</HI> It is most cer∣tain,
that by the goodnesse of the climate and soile,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Canaan</HI> great∣ly changed.</NOTE> espe∣cially
by the blessing of God, it was the most fruitfull
Land in the World: But by experience, I finde now the
contrary, and the fruitfulnesse thereof to be changed, God
cursing the Land together with the <HI>Iews,</HI> then the (but
now dispersed) inhabitants thereof. Neither are the grea∣test
part of these Eastern Countries so fertile, as they have
been in former ages, the earth as it were growing old, see∣meth
weary to beare the burthen of any more encrease;
and surely the two eyes of Day and Night, with the Pla∣nets,
and Stars, are become neither so forcible, so bright,
nor warme as they have been: Time from old antiquity,
running all things to devasted desolation, making the
strong things weak, and weake things feeble, at last it re∣turneth
all things to just nothing: and there is the end of
all beginnings, and an infallible Argument of the dissolu∣tion
to come by the day of judgement.</P>
<Q><PB N="215" REF="119"/>
<L>As things that are, still vanish from our eye,</L>
<L>So things that were, again shall never be:</L>
<L>The whirlwinde of Time, still so speedy posts,</L>
<L>That like it selfe, all things therein it tosts.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Iews</HI> are also tearmed <HI>Hebrai,</HI> or <HI>Hebrewes</HI> from
<HI>Heber</HI> one of <HI>Abrahams</HI> Progenitors, or <HI>Hebrae quasi A∣brahaei:</HI>
who at their descent into <HI>Egypt,</HI> were but seven∣ty
soules being the issue of <HI>Iacob,</HI> and his twelve Sonnes.
The posterity of which <HI>Patriachy,</HI> continned in bondage
two hundred and fifteene yeares, till in the yeare of the
World, two thousand foure hundred fifty three: At which
time, the Lord commiserating their heavy oppressions
under the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> delivered them with a strong hand,
and placed them here: which then was inhabited by the
<HI>Hittites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Land.</NOTE> <HI>Amorites, Perisites,</HI> and <HI>Iebusites. Canaan</HI> is di∣vided
into five Provinces, viz. <HI>Iudea, Galilee, Palestina,

in generall, <HI>Syria,</HI> by which Calculation, they
gathered all the Countries from <HI>Cilicia</HI> to <HI>Aegypt</HI> under
that name. But howsoever they differ in Descriptions, it
is most certaine, that at this day, it is onely, and usually
divided into these five particular Provinces: <HI>Galilee</HI> and
<HI>Palestina,</HI> for the present, are the most fertile and largest
Provinces thereof, especially <HI>Galilee,</HI> which in some
parts, yieldeth graine twice a yeare, and for abundance
of Silke; Cotton-wooll, delicate Wines, Honey, Oile,
and Fruits of all kinds; I hold it never a whit more de∣cayed
now, than at any time when the glory of <HI>Israel</HI> was
at the highest: This Province of <HI>Galilee</HI> is forty eight
miles long, and twentie five broad, having <HI>Phoenicia</HI> to
the North: <HI>Samaria</HI> to the West: <HI>Iordan</HI> to the South: and
<PB N="216" REF="120"/>
to the East and North-East, a part or point of <HI>Arabia Pe∣trosa,</HI>
and the South-West of <HI>Libanus.</HI></P>
<P>After we had travelled a great way, along the Lake
of <HI>Genasareth,</HI> which is of length eight leagues, and large
foure: where I saw the decayed Townes of <HI>Bethsaida,</HI>
and <HI>Tyberias,</HI> lying on the north-side of the same Sea,
we left the <HI>Marine,</HI> and came to <HI>Cana,</HI> to stay all night:
in which wee had no <HI>Canes</HI> to save us from the <HI>Arabs,</HI>
nor coverture above our heads, but the hard ground to
lye on, which was alwayes my Bed, in the most parts of
<HI>Asia:</HI> In the night when wee slept, the <HI>Souldiers</HI> kept
C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntinell, and in the day, when we Reposed, they slept,
and we watched.</P>
<P>This <HI>Cana</HI> was the town vvherein our <HI>Saviour</HI> wrought
the first <HI>Miracle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cana</HI> in <HI>Galilee.</HI></NOTE> converting at the <HI>Marriage,</HI> Water
into Wine: And is now called by the <HI>Turkes Callieros</HI> or
<HI>Calinos,</HI> being a towne composed of two hundred fire
Houses: The inhabitants being partly <HI>Arabs,</HI> partly
<HI>Iewes,</HI> and partly some Christian <HI>Georgians:</HI> the circum∣jacent
fieldes, being both Fertile, Delectable, and
plaine.</P>
<P>The day following, imbracing our way, we passed o∣ver
a little pleasant Mountain, where the <HI>Armenian Pa∣triarke</HI>
(for so was there one with them) went into an old
Chappell, and all the rest of the <HI>Pilgrimes</HI> thronged a∣bout
him, using many strange <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> for it was in
that place (as they said) <HI>Where Christ fed five thousand
people, with five Barley loaves, and two fishes.</HI> And indeede
was very likely to have beene the place: the auncient
Chappell, shewing as yet some beautifull decorements,
doe dignify both the Monument, and the <HI>Memory</HI> of the
<HI>Founder</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>Continuing our journey, wee saw Mount <HI>Tabor</HI> on our
<PB N="217" REF="120"/>
left hand, which is a pretty round Mountaine, beset a∣bout
with comely trees: I would gladly have seene the
Monument of that place, where the <HI>Transfiguration</HI> of
<HI>Christ</HI> was: but the <HI>Caravan,</HI> mindfull to visite <HI>Nazareth,</HI>
left the great way of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and would by no per∣swasion
go thither,</P>
<P>That night we lodged in a poore Village called <HI>Heer∣schek,</HI>
where we could get neither meate for our selves,
nor provender for our Beasts, but some of our Compa∣ny
for their supper, had a hundred stroakes from the
<HI>Moores</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> in that place, because the Christian
Pilgrimes had troden upon the graves of their dead
friends, which by no means they can tollerate: They
made no small uproare amongst us, desperately throw∣ing
stones and darts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caesarea Phi∣lippi.</NOTE> till we were all glad to remove halfe
a mile from that place; and the next morning we passed
by <HI>Caesarea Philippi</HI> which is now so miserably decayed,
that the ruined Towne affordeth not above twenty foure
dwelling houses, being for ruines a second Towne, to
sacked <HI>Samaria,</HI> or another spectacle of time like to the
now ragged Towne of the Moorish <HI>Bethulia;</HI> it was built
by <HI>Phillip</HI> one of the <HI>Tetrachs</HI> in honour of <HI>Tiberius Cae∣sar,</HI>
and now called by the <HI>Moores Hedarasco.</HI> Here was
<HI>Herod</HI> smitten by the Angell, and eaten of worms, after
the <HI>Sycophanticall</HI> people called his Rethoricall oration;
<HI>the voice of God and not of man.</HI> Here our Saviour healed
the woman of the bloody fluxe, and raised from death
to life the daughter of <HI>Iairus:</HI> Here Saint <HI>Peter</HI> baptized
<HI>Cornelius,</HI> and S. <HI>Paul</HI> disputed against <HI>Tertul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> in the
prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of <HI>Felix.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aprill</HI> the 20 day, about ten of the clocke (passing
the River <HI>Kyson</HI>) we arrived at <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and there re∣posed
till the evening, providing our selves of victuals
<PB N="218" REF="121"/>
and water: In this Towne dwelt <HI>Ioseph,</HI> and the Virgin
<HI>Mary;</HI> and in which also our Saviour was brought up un∣der
the vigilant care of <HI>Ioseph</HI> and <HI>Mary.</HI> After wee had
dined, the <HI>Armenians</HI> arose, and went to a heap of stones,
the ruines of an old House before the which they fell
downe upon their knees; praysing God: And that rui∣nous
lumpe (say they) was the House where <HI>Mary</HI> dwelt,
when <HI>Gabriel</HI> saluted her, bringing the Annunciation of
Salvation to the World: I am fully perswaded, they car∣ried
away above five thousand pounds weight, to keepe in
a memoriall thereof: then did I remember of the Chap∣pell
of <HI>Loretta,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A counter∣bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>et for <HI>Lo∣retta.</HI></NOTE> and told the Caravan, that I saw that
House standing in <HI>Italy,</HI> which (as the <HI>Romanists</HI> say) was
transported by the Angels: O, said he, we <HI>Armenians</HI> can∣not
believe that, neither many other assertions of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Church; for wee certainly know by Christians, that
have from time to time dwelt here ever since, that this is,
both the place, and stones of the House: Let Papists coine
a new Law to themselves, wee care not, for as they erre in
this, so doe they erre in all, following meerly the Tra∣ditions
of men, they run galloping post to Hell. The Pa∣triarch
being informed by the laughing Caravan of these
news, asked me in disdain (thinking it had been an Arti∣cle
of my beliefe) if I saw that House, or believed that
the Chappell of <HI>Loretta</HI> was such a thing: to whom I
constantly answered, I did not believe it, affirming it was
onely but a Devillish invention, to deceive the blind-fol∣ded
people, and to fill the Coffers of the <HI>Roman</HI> priests:
Now thou bottomlesse Gulfe of papistry, here I forsake
thee, no Winter-blasting Furies of Satans subtile storms,
can make shipwrack of my Faith, on the stony shelves of
they deceitfull deeps.</P>
<P>Thus, and after this manner too: are all the illusions of
<PB N="219" REF="121"/>
their imaginary and false miracles, first invented partly
by monasteriall pouerty, then confirmed by provincial
bribery, and lastly they are faith-sold for consistoricall
lucre. In the time of our staying here; the <HI>Emeere</HI> or Lord
of the Towne sent six women, conducted by 12 of his ser∣vants,
to an <HI>Armenian</HI> Prince, that was a Pilgrime in our
company: to be used by him and others whom so he
would elect to be his fellow labourers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Libidinous leachery.</NOTE> Which indeed he
did kindly accept, and invited me to that feast: but I gave
him the refusall, little regarding such a frivolous commo∣dity.
He, and fome of the chiefe Pilgrimes entertayned
them for the space of three houres, and sent them backe,
giving to their Conductors fifteene Piasters in a reward.
Truly if I would rehearse the impudency of these whoors,
and the brutishnesse of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> as it is most igno∣minious
to the actors; so no doubt, it would be very loath∣some
to the Reader.</P>
<P>Such is the villanie of these <HI>Orientall</HI> slaues under the
<HI>Turkes;</HI> that not onely by conversing with them, learne
some of their damnable Hethnick customes, but also go∣ing
beyond them in beastly sensualnesse, become worse
then bruite beasts: This maketh me remember a worthy
saying of that Heathenish <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour <HI>Marcus Au∣relius,</HI>
who in consideration of fleshly lusts, said; that
although he were sure, that the gods would not punish
him for the offence; yet he would forbeare it, in regard
of the filthinesse of the fact it selfe: Indeede of a Pagan
a noble and vertuous resolution, when such base and beast∣ly
Christians, these wretched <HI>Armenians,</HI> committed
with these Infidelish harlots a twofold kind of voluptu∣ous
abhomination, which my conscience commands me
to conceale: least I frequent this Northen World, with
that which their nature never knew, nor their knowledge
<PB N="220" REF="122"/>
have heard hearing of the like: but God in his iust judge∣ments,
that same night, threatned both to have punished
the doers, and the whole company for their sakes: For
wee having resolved to travell all that night, and because
the way was rocky and hard to be knowne, and peril∣lous
for <HI>Arabs;</HI> we hired a Christian guide named <HI>Ioab,</HI>
and agreed with him to take us to <HI>Lidda,</HI> which was two
dayes journey. But before we advanced to our passage,
<HI>Ioab</HI> had sent a privie messenger before us, to warne a∣bout
three hundred <HI>Arabs</HI> (who had their abode on the
South side of Mount <HI>Carmell</HI>) to meete him at such a
place as he had appointed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A villanous plot.</NOTE> giving them to know, wee
were rich and well provided with Chickens and Sultans
of Gold, and Piasters of silver, and that he should render
us into their hands for such a recompence and considera∣tion,
as their savage judgement should thinke fit; accor∣ding
to the spoyles and booties they should obtaine, to∣gether
with the miserable murder and losse of our lives.
This being done, and unknown to us, we marched along,
travelling faster then our ordinary pace, some on horse,
and some on foot, for my pilgrimage was ever pedestri∣all:
which our guide suspecting that by our celerity wee
should goe beyond the place appointed for his treache∣rous
plot, began to crosse us grievously; leading us up
and downe amongst pools and holes, whither he listed;
where many of our Camels &amp; Asses were lost, and could
not be recovered, because wee all began to suspect and
feare; which was the cause that the owners durst not stay
to relieve their perished beasts.</P>
<P>In the end, the Captaine and <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> intreated him
earnestly to bring us in the right way; but the more they
requested, the more obdurate was his heart, replying, he
was mistaken, and could not finde it, till day light: upon
<PB N="221" REF="122"/>
the which words, the company was stayed, and in the
mean-while there came a <HI>Turke,</HI> one of our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uldiers
unto the Captain, saying; hee saw the Guide, before our
departure from <HI>Nazareth,</HI> send a <HI>Moore</HI> before him, for
what respect hee knew not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A treacherou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Guide.</NOTE> being long at private confe∣rence.
Whereupon, they straight bound him with ropes,
on a horse back, threatning him with death, to cause him
confesse the truth.</P>
<P>In the midst of this tumult, I having got sight of the
North-starre, (which seem'd exceeding low to me) con∣sidered
thereby, that the Villaine had led us more to the
Southward, then to the Westward, which was our way to
Jerusalem: <HI>Whereupon I intreated the Caravan to turne
our faces Northward, otherwise we should be cut off, and
that suddenly: for although (said I) it may peradventure
be, that we are three or foure miles short of the place inten∣ded
for our massacre, yet they missing us, will like ravening
Wolves hunt here and there; wherefore, if wee, incline to
the North, (God willing) wee shall prevent their bloody
designes.</HI> To the which advice (being duely pondered)
they yielded; and so I became their Guide, in that darke
night, till morning: for none of them knew that Starre,
neither the nature of it. At last this desperate wretch con∣sidering
that either by our vanquishing, or the enemies
victory, hee could not escape, sith his Treason was re∣vealed;
began to beg pardon of the Caravan, saying that
if he could have any surety of his life, he would sufficient∣ly
informe us, how to eschew these iminent dangers, for
we were all in extream perill of our lives; and not so much
courage not comfort left us, as the very smallest hope of
any relief.</P>
<P>The Captain being distracted with feare, replied hee
would, and thereupon swore a solemne oath, so did the
<PB N="222" REF="123"/>
<HI>Ianizaries</HI> sweare by the head of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> for the like ef∣fect:
Which being done, he was untied, and confessed, that
if we had continued in our way he led us, we had been all
put to the edge of the Sword: and falling downe on his
knees, cried oft with teares, mercy, mercy, mercy.</P>
<P>All that night we went with that <HI>Starre,</HI> and against
morning wee were in the Westerne confines of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI>
and at the beginning of <HI>Palestine,</HI> close by the Marine, and
within halfe a mile of <HI>Tyrus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tyrus</HI> is called <HI>Sur.</HI></NOTE> This sometimes renowned
City of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> called now by the <HI>Moores Sur,</HI> was fa∣mous
for her Purples, and Collonies dispersed over all the
World by her Citizens; and once a Kingdome of great
antiquity and long continuance. The most worthiest of
her Kings, were <HI>Hiram</HI> in strict bond of Confederaie,
with <HI>Salomon,</HI> and <HI>Pigmalion</HI> the brother of <HI>Dido,</HI> who

more desolate. At the breake of day, I and certain <HI>Arme∣nians</HI>
went to visit this decayed Towne, and found the
most famous ruines here, that the Word for memory
can affoord, and a Delicious incircling Harbour, inclos'd
within the middle of the Town, fit to receive small Barks,
Frigots, and Galleots: the compassing fore-face whereof,
being all of foure squared Marble and Alablaster stones:
the most part of all which Houses have stood on pillars
<PB N="223" REF="123"/>
of the same stones: the infinite number whereof may as
yet be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ruines of <HI>Tyrus.</HI></NOTE> (above and below the sands) perspectively beheld.
There be onely some nineteene fire houses here, which are
<HI>Moores:</HI> and is now under the <HI>Emeere</HI> of the <HI>Drusians,</HI>
who remayneth in <HI>Sydon.</HI> The East part of this Country
aboundeth in Balme, Honey, and Oile, and was the Seat
of <HI>Asher,</HI> of whom <HI>Moses</HI> prophecied, <HI>Deut.</HI> 33. 24. that
he should dip his feet in Oile.</P>
<P>Here these <HI>Egyptian Moores,</HI> for so they were first bred
there: brought us a pillar lying upon the ground, of nine
severall colours of Marble, being one intire stone, and the
length of it was twenty two of my measure, and eight in
compasse: Which said they, was one of the Pillars that
<HI>Sampson</HI> pulled downe upon the <HI>Philistims</HI> at the
houre of his Death.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sampsons</HI> Pillar.</NOTE> To whom I answered, that
<HI>Sampson</HI> died at <HI>Azath,</HI> the furthest South-west part of
<HI>Palestine</HI> where he bore down the House of <HI>Dagon</HI> upon
the <HI>Philistims:</HI> And I thinke the ancient <HI>Tyrians,</HI> said I,
could not transport that Pillar so far hither: But they the
more constantly affirmed it, and so did these <HI>Armenians</HI>
that were with me confirme it also, some of whom, had
been twice there before: yet howsoever it was, I brought
home a pound weight of it, and presented the half there∣of,
to King <HI>Iames of blessed Memory.</HI></P>
<P>Here by accident, in returning back to the Caravan, I
met with an <HI>English Factor,</HI> named Master <HI>Brockesse,</HI>
who then remayned at <HI>Sydon,</HI> eighteene miles from this
place, and had beene down at <HI>Acre</HI> about some negotiati∣ons:
Who indeed eftsoons, and kindly tooke mee into a
<HI>Moorish</HI> House by the Sea side, and one of his acquain∣tance:
where instantly wee swallowed downe such joviall
and deep carouses of <HI>Leatick</HI> Wine, that both hee and I,
were almost fastned in the last plunge of understanding:
<PB N="224" REF="124"/>
Yet neverthelesse, he conveyed me backe to my compa∣ny,
and put me safe into the hands of the Caravan, with
whom afterwards I diverse times met with here at <HI>Lon∣don:</HI>
to whose kindnesse I celebrate the memory of these
lines.</P>
<P>But now the Sunne discovering the earth, and the
night banished to the inferiour world, we were all en∣couraged,
for the light of the day lends comfort: The
Captaine (sending backe that false <HI>Iudas,</HI> for so was hee
sworne to do) sent a post to <HI>Tyrus</HI> for a new guide, who
came forthwith, and brought us in our way to Mount
<HI>Carmell,</HI> for by it we behoved to go; and in our way we
met with the desolate Towne of <HI>Sarepta</HI> nigh thereunto
adjoyning, where <HI>Elias</HI> was sustained in a great famine by
a Widdow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A corrupted Caravan.</NOTE> whose sonne he raised from death.</P>
<P>Great are the mercies of God, for as hee hath made
man an excellent creature, so hath he also indued him
with two great powers in his minde: The one a wise po∣wer
of understanding, by which he penetrateth into the
knowledge of things: the other a strong power of dexte∣rous
resolving; whereby he executeth things well under∣stood,
for we having judged the worst, resolved the best:
and by his Almighty providence were freed from that
apparent danger, although the former dayes whoredome,
and unnaturall vices, deserved a just punishment.</P>
<P>This I intimate to all Travelers in generall, that if
they would that God should further them in their at∣tempts,
blesse their voyages, and grant them a safe re∣turne
to their native Countries (without the which, what
contentment have they for all their pains?) that they
would constantly refraine from whoredome, drunken∣nesse,
and too much familiarity with strangers: <HI>For a
Traveller that is not temperate, and circumspect in all his
<PB N="225" REF="124"/>
actions, although he were headed like that Herculean Ser∣pent</HI>
Hydra, <HI>yet it is impossible he can returne in safety from
danger of the</HI> Turkes, Arabs, Moors, <HI>wild beasts, &amp; the dead∣ly
operative extremities of heat, hunger, thirst, and cold.</HI></P>
<P>Approaching to Moun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Carmell,</HI> and leaving it upon
our right hand betweene us and the Marine coast, I
beheld a farre off upon the top of the hill, the place where
<HI>Elias</HI> ascended to Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, when hee left his Cloake be∣hind
him to <HI>Elizeus</HI> his Disciple. This mountaine is
foure miles of length, lying South and North, the North
end bordering with the Sea, neare to <HI>Acre,</HI> called ancient∣ly
<HI>Ptolomaeis,</HI> and the South end joyning with the borders
of <HI>Samaria,</HI> through the which confine we past.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Samaria</HI> on our left hand, wee entred into a
faire Plaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Samaria.</NOTE> adorned with fruitfull Trees, and all other
ornaments that pleasant fields afford; but no Village
wee saw. Marching thus about the declining of the
Sunne from the Meridian, wee came in sight of two
hundred Pavillians, all pitched in rankes; yeelding the
prospect of a little City, by a brooke side of water:
which being perceived, the Captaine began to cen∣sure
what they might bee; and immediately there came
riding towards us, sixe naked fellowes, well mounted
on <HI>Arabian</HI> Geldings, who demanded what wee were?
and whither we were bound with such a multitude; and if
there were any <HI>Franks</HI> of <HI>Christendome</HI> in our company.
To whom the <HI>Ianisaries</HI> replyed, we were purposed to <HI>Ie∣rusalem,</HI>
and that there was but one <HI>Franke</HI> with them:
Upon the which they presently sought mee, demanding
<HI>Caffar, Caffar;</HI> that was tribute for my head, &amp; caused me
perforce notwithstanding of the resisting <HI>Caravan,</HI> and
<HI>Ianisaries,</HI> to pay them presently for my life seven
Chickens of Gold, seven times nine shillings sterling:
<PB N="226" REF="125"/>
And this is, because sayd they, our King is resident in these
Tents, and therefore we haue tripled his tribute: And
yet were they discontented, because there were no moe
Franks in our company, for from the <HI>Armenians,</HI> they
could not, nor would not seeke any tribute, because they
were tributary slaves and subjects to the great <HI>Turke:</HI> nei∣there
also of any other Christians borne in his dominions,
when they shall happen to fall into their hands.</P>
<P>They returning backe to their Prince, with the male∣diction
of my heart, and the sorrow of a Pilgrimes purse,
we marching on in our way, that day wee travelled above
thirty foure miles, and pitched at a Village called <HI>Adoash,</HI>
being composed of threescore <HI>Moorish</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI>
Houses, standing in a fruitfull and delicate Plaine;
and garnished with Olive, Date, and Figge-trees,
which were both pleasant and profitable: where we
found also good Hearbs to eate, and abundance of
Water to drinke, and also to fill our emptied bottles:
As wee lay downe to sleepe after a hungry supper, on
the hard ground, and our guard watching us; that same
King of the <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bians</HI> came a little before mid-night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Savage <HI>Arabian</HI> King</NOTE>
with twenty four wel horsed Runagates, and naked Cour∣tiers,
being armed with bowes and arrowes, and halfe-pikes,
pointed at both ends with hard Steele; and asked
for the <HI>Caravan,</HI> who presently awoke, and went to salute
him, laying his hand on his breast, bowed his head very
low; which is the usuall courtesie amongst the Infidels
and Christians in these parts: For they never uncover
their heads to any man; and after some short parley, they
sate all downe on the grasse. The <HI>Caravan</HI> presented
his rude like maiesty with water, bread, hearbes, figs,
garlike, and such things as he had.</P>
<P>As they were thus merry, at this poore banquet, the
<PB N="227" REF="125"/>
awfull King tooke the Oath of our Conductor, if there
were any more <HI>Franks</HI> there then I; and he having sworne
the truth: the King by a malignant informer, in∣continently
caused mee to bee brought before him; and
staring mee in the face, asked my Interpreter where
were my companions? Who replyed I had none: then
said hee, tell that dogge, or <HI>Elishole,</HI> hee must acknow∣ledge
me with five peeces of gold more, otherwise (ma∣king
a signe to his owne throate) I shall cut off his head,
because (said he) I will not loose this nights travell for
nothing: The which I being informed, and knowing
that by no condition;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exaction of tributes.</NOTE> there was resistance against such
a scelerate Prince, gave it him forth of mine owne hand,
having consulted with my Captaine before, and that pre∣sently
with a halfe smiling countenance; which hee re∣marking,
told the rest, it seemed I gave it with a good
heart and a cheerefull gesture, and to recompence my
outward behaviour, he drunke a great draught of water
to me: thinking thereby, he had done mee more honour
then all the Chickens of gold I gave him now, and in
the morning would doe him profit or pleasure: pleasure
they could doe him none, for they were unlawfully
and dishonestly got, and too delivered from the in∣ward
sorrow of my sighing soule; and no wonder, ha∣ving
spent two yeares great charges in <HI>Turkey,</HI> before
this time, but that I should have beene exceeding penu∣rious
of money, and thereupon desolate of reliefe and
comfort.</P>
<P>Truely this was one of the greatest tributes I payed
for one dayes journey, that I had in all my voyage, in
<HI>Asia.</HI> There are two Kings in <HI>Arabia,</HI> the one who
liveth on <HI>Euphrates,</HI> the desarts of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> some∣times
in <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> and in some parts of <HI>Syria:</HI> And
<PB N="228" REF="126"/>
the other was hee to whom I paid this money) wan∣dereth
with his Tribes, Tents, and Bestiall, one while in
<HI>Arabia Petrea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two <HI>Arabian</HI> Kings.</NOTE> and <HI>Deserta,</HI> and sometimes in the <HI>Holy
Land,</HI> as hee findeth good pastorage, and fresh Foun∣taines.
These two Kings are mortall enemies: and if by ac∣cident
they meete, they fight most cruelly, bringing dam∣mage,
rapine, and destruction to themselves, and their fol∣lowers:
for it is a difficult thing in them to dominate their
inordinate passions, being untamed Savages, and mis∣regarders
of civility, who continually contend to corro∣borate
the malignity of their dispositions, with bloody
and inhumane interprises. And yet al the rest of that night,
after his returne from us, we still expected some treache∣rous
surprise, which made our Souldiers stand stoutly on
their guard, and we Pilgrims to our vigilant and naked
defence: For the <HI>Turkes</HI> will not suffer Christians to carry
weapons in al these Dominions, neither any where, where
they command. And for all this great tribute, and nights
danger of my life, here was my present resolution:
<Q><L>The more I am beset, with dreadfull snares</L>
<L>Begirded round, in shelfie gulfes of wracke;</L>
<L>And shipbroke left, on rockes of deepe despaires,</L>
<L>Where helples care, with tort 'ring thoughts me racke:</L>
<L>Then stoutly stand I, hoping for the end,</L>
<L>That time will change, and God will better send.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now by the way I recall the aforesaid <HI>Turke,</HI> the
master of the Mule that carried my provision, and on
whom in the journey I had bestowed the most part of my
Tobacco: When I had no more to give him, and hee sus∣pecting
the contrary, was councelled bee his associats to
beate me soundly, and dismount my Victuals and Wa∣ter
from the Mules backe, till I propined him with the
<PB N="229" REF="126"/>
rest. Which intention being by me understood; I forth∣with
run to the Caravan and complained: whereupon my
friend was bravely belaboured with a cudgel, and my bet∣ter
safety procured: Thus was his former shew of love
quickly expelled, and an inward grudge suddenly concei∣ved,
for it was the smoak, and not my self he respected.</P>
<Q><L>Loves whirling fancies, mortals fondly feed</L>
<L>As marish roots dissolve, even as they breed:</L>
<L>An humane creature, inhumanely taught,</L>
<L>Is worser given to ill, than evill fraught:</L>
<L>Things in themselves, be not so bad as ill,</L>
<L>The cause exeem'd, corruption hath free will:</L>
<L>Mans frail affection, is a cloudy mist,</L>
<L>Whose vapours fall, and fogge, as passions list:</L>
<L>Bad counsell's worse, than nature ill applies,</L>
<L>Weak judgement duls, when fear in reason flies:</L>
<L>Thus sad eclips'd, the dark eclipsed Moon</L>
<L>Did change, ere mine eclipsed light was won.</L>
<L>At last the Sun-shine, of my silver day,</L>
<L>Came crawling on, as Snails advance the way.</L></Q>
<P>The next morning, when the hopefull <HI>Aurore</HI> had fore∣shown
the burning birth of glassie <HI>Thetis,</HI> and that Orient
Majesty arising to overcirculate the earth, then marcht we
along in our way, and before mid-day pitched our Haire-cloth
Tents round about <HI>Iacobs</HI> Well,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iacobs</HI> Well.</NOTE> neere the decayed
City of <HI>Sychar</HI> in <HI>Samaria:</HI> This Province of <HI>Samaria,</HI> is
now for the most part quite destroyed and over-whelmed
with Mountains of sand: wee found this ancient Well so
wondrous deep, that scarcely all our ropes could sinke our
bucket in the water: The tast whereof was wondrous cold
and sweet, and for <HI>Iacobs</HI> sake, the whole number of us
<PB N="230" REF="127"/>
drunk more of it, then need required: The fiery face of
<HI>Phaebus</HI> declining to the <HI>West,</HI> we marched through a part
of the fields of <HI>Basan,</HI> of which <HI>Og</HI> was last King, a man of
such a large proportion, that his bed being made of iron,
was nine Cubits long, and foure broad: and all that after∣noon
we had exceeding pleasant travelling; and at night
we incamped by <HI>Lydda</HI> on the fields: <HI>Lydda</HI> is not above
ten miles from the ruinous <HI>Towne</HI> of <HI>Caesarea</HI> by the Sea
side, and is now called by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moores Alferron,</HI>
being a Village only of sixteen <HI>Moorish</HI> Houses. Here <HI>Peter</HI>
healed the man sick of the palsie.</P>
<P>The Towns situated by the Sea side in <HI>Phoenicia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sea-port Towns of the Holy Land.</NOTE> <HI>Pale∣stine,</HI>

a goodly City, and well peopled; and is governed by the
<HI>Emeere,</HI> or Prince of the <HI>Drusians:</HI> who being the off∣spring
of the Christians, which under the Conduct of
<HI>Godfrey</HI> Duke of <HI>Bulloine,</HI> descended into these parts, do
still maintain their liberty against the <HI>Turkes:</HI> The Sig∣nior

excepted.</P>
<P>Saturday morning before the break of day, setting for∣ward
from <HI>Lydda,</HI> through the curling playnes of fat-fac'd
<HI>Palestine,</HI> scarcely were wee well advanced in our
way, till wee were beset with more then three hundred
<HI>Arabs,</HI> who sent us from shrubby heights an unexpect∣ed
shoure of Arrows, to the great annoyance of all our
Company:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dreadfull conflict.</NOTE> For if it had not beene, that our Souldiers
shot off their Gunnes on a sudden, and stood manly also
to it, with their Bows and Arrows for our defence, wee
had then miserably, in the midst of their ravenous fury
perished. But the nature of the <HI>Arabs</HI> is not unlike to the
<HI>Iackals:</HI> For when any of them heare the shot of a Har∣quebuse,
they presently turn back with such speed, as if
the Fiends of the infernall Court were broken loose at
their heels.</P>
<P>In that momentany conflict, on our side there were
<PB N="232" REF="128"/>
killed nine Women, five Men, and about thirty persons
deadly wounded, which to our worthy <HI>Armenian</HI> Cap∣tayne,
and to the rest of our Heathnish Conductors bred
no small griefe: the mourning noyse among the multi∣tude,
beeing also wondrous pittifull. Till bright day
came, we stayed still in that same place, (expecting the
dangerous mutability of our austere fortune) and at our
departure thence, wee buried the slayne people in deep
graves, whereby <HI>Iackals</HI> should not open up their graves,
to eate their Corpes: for such is the nature of these cruell
beasts, that they onely love to live on mans flesh: these
ravenous beasts (as is thought) are ingendred of a Foxe
and a Wolfe.</P>
<P>Proceeding in our journy, we entred about two of the
clocke in the afternoone, in the hilly Countrey of <HI>Iudea,</HI>
having two of their courses to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which is about
twenty English miles: leaving <HI>Rhama</HI> on our right hand,
which contayneth some two hundred dwelling houses of
one story high, and ten miles distant from <HI>Ioppa,</HI> from
which it lyeth in the way to <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> Here remayneth
the <HI>Dragoman,</HI> a Christian, who receiveth and conveyeth
the Pilgrimes to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which land at <HI>Ioppa,</HI> each
Pilgrime paying seven Chickens of gold, is furnished
with an Asse to ride on, all the way tributes, at going
and comming being discharged by their Conductor, to
whom they resigne this tributary mony.</P>
<P><HI>Rhama</HI> is a Town inhabited by <HI>Christians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town of <HI>Rhama.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Arabs,</HI> and

are the ill best of all the three, yet all sworne enemies to
Christ. But when they know how to make any gaine by
strangers, O what a dissimulate ostentation shall appeare
in these detestable Villains, whose out-sides onely they
seem to affect, but intirely the in-sides of their purses? and
that is their ayme, and forcible end: wherefore they both
toile with all, and conduct strangers through many perils,
as eminent to themselves, as accessary unto our inevitable
destinies: Time discussing all, and money over-mastering
time; for Coine is the thing they must have, though ne∣cessity
sometimes may not spare it.</P>
<P>About foure of the clock before night, wee arrived at
<HI>Berah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beersheba.</HI></NOTE> called of old <HI>Beersheba,</HI> being eleven miles
distant from <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Having a little reposed there, gi∣ving
our Camels, Mules, and Asses some provender, but
could get nothing for our selves, from these despightfull
<HI>Moores,</HI> (for what we carried with us, was all spent) ex∣cept
a little Water: Wee embraced our Mountainous
way, as cheerfully as wee could, for wee were excee∣ding
faint, and travelled that day above forty three
miles; whereby we might arrive at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> before the
Gates were shut, sustaining great drought, burning heate,
pinching hunger, and not a few other the like inconveni∣ences.</P>
<P>And now about halfe way betweene <HI>Berah</HI> and <HI>Ieru∣salem,</HI>
I, and two <HI>Armenians,</HI> advancing our way a
flight shot before the Company. Wee I say, unhappily
rancountred with foure <HI>Moorish</HI> fellows, driving be∣fore
them six Asses loaden with roots, and shrubs of
Wood to burne: who seeing us, they thought alone,
layd hands upon us, robbed us of our pocket monies:
<PB N="234" REF="129"/>
whereat I resisting, one of them pulled forth a broad
knife,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grievous anger.</NOTE> and holding me by the Beard, thought to have
cut my throate, if it had not beene for one of his fellowes,
who swiftly stayed him.</P>
<P>Well, they leave us, and following their Beasts, our
Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers instantly appeared unto us; whereupon we
shouting, the <HI>Moores</HI> fled to the Rocks, and our foot Soul∣diers
following, apprehended two of the chiefest, and
brought them to the Captaine: One of which had my
money, which I presently received backe againe, but
mine associates money, was with them that escaped: the
Captaine and <HI>Ianisaries,</HI> meane while carried the two
<HI>Moores</HI> along with them, thinking to execute them at
<HI>Ierusalem.</HI> But their friends and neighbours following
fast on Horse-backe, and on foote relieved them from
the Caravan, restoring back again the two <HI>Armenians</HI>
money. Whereat all the <HI>Moores</HI> were exceding glad,
and wee no ways discontented: for if they had not bin
redeemed, certainely their friends and followers, who
were thicke flocking together, would have cut us all off,
before we could have attained to <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>At last wee beheld the prospect of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which
was not onely a contentment to my weary body, but al∣so
being ravished with a kinde of unwonted rejoycing,
the teares gushed from my eyes for too much ioy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A joyful har∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ony.</NOTE> In
this time the <HI>Armenians</HI> began to sing in their owne fa∣shion
Psalmes to praise the Lord: and I also sung the 103
Psalme all the way, till we arrived neere the wals of the
City, where wee ceased from our singing, for feare of
the <HI>Turkes</HI></P>
<P>The Sunne being passed to his nightly Repose, before
our arrivall, we found the Gates locked, and the Keyes
carried up to the <HI>Bashaw</HI> in the Castle; which bred
<PB N="235" REF="129"/>
a common sorrow in the company, being all both hun∣gry,
and weary: yet the Caravan intreated earnestly the
<HI>Turkes</HI> within, to give us over the Wals, some victuals
for our money, shewing heavily the necessity wee had
thereof, but they would not, neither durst attempt such
a thing. In this time the Guardian of the Monastery of
<HI>Cordeleirs,</HI> who remayneth there to receive Travailers
of <HI>Christendome,</HI> who having got newes of our late ar∣rivall,
came and demanded of the Caravan, if any
<HI>Frankes</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> were in his Society, and hee said, one∣ly
one. Then the <HI>Guardian</HI> called me, and asked of
what nation I was of, and when I told him, hee seemed
to be exceeding glad: yet very sorrowfull for our misfor∣tune.</P>
<P>Hee having knowne my distresse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dear nights Supper.</NOTE> returned, and sent
two Friers to me with Bread, Wine, and Fishes, which
they let over the Wall (as they thought in a secret place)
but they were espied, and on the <HI>morrow</HI> the <HI>Guardiano</HI>
payed to the <HI>Subbashaw</HI> or <HI>Sanzacke</HI> a great fine, being a
hundred <HI>Piasters</HI> thirty pounds sterling: otherwise both
hee and I had bin beheaded: which I confesse, was a

to me, being both in danger of my Life for star∣ving,
and then for receivi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of food, therefore suspect∣ed
for a traytor: for the <HI>Turkes</HI> alleadged, he had taken
in munition from me, and the other <HI>Christians,</HI> to betray
the City: this they doe oft, for a lesser fault then that
was, onely to get Bribes and money from the <HI>Grey Friers</HI>
which daily stand in fear of their lives.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1612, upon <HI>Palme-Sunday</HI> in the morning, wee
entered into <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and at the Gate wee were particu∣larly
searched, to the effect wee carried in no Fur∣niture
of Armes, nor powder with us, and the poore
<PB N="236" REF="130"/>
<HI>Armenians</HI> (notwithstanding they are slaves to <HI>Turkes</HI>)
behoved to render their weapons to the Keepers, such is
the fear they have of Christians. And my name was writ∣ten
up in the <HI>Clarkes</HI> Booke at the Port, that my tribute
for the Gate, and my seeing of the Sepulchre, might be
payed at one time together, before my finall departure
thence.</P>
<P>The Gates of the City are of iron outwardly, and a∣bove
each Gate are brazen Ordnance planted, for their
defence.</P>
<P>Having taken my leave of the Caravan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A foolish Ce∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emony.</NOTE> and the Com∣pany,
who went to lodge with their own Patriarch, I was
met and received with the <HI>Guardian,</HI> and twelve <HI>Friers</HI>
upon the streets, each of them carrying in their hands a
burning wax Candle, and one for mee also: who received
me joyfully, and singing all the way to their Monastery,
<HI>Te Deum Laudamus,</HI> they mightily rejoyced, that a Chri∣stian
had come from such a far Countrey as <HI>Scotia,</HI> to vi∣sit
<HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Where being arrived, they forth-with brought me to
a Roome, and there the <HI>Guardian</HI> washed my right
foot with water, and his Vicar my left: and done, they
kissed my feet, so did also all the twelve <HI>Friers</HI> that
stood by: But when they knew afterward that I was no
Popish Catholicke, it sore repented them of their la∣bour.
I found here ten <HI>Frankes</HI> newly come the neerest
way from <HI>Venice</HI> hither, sixe of them were <HI>Germans,</HI>
noble Gentlemen, and they also good Protestants, who
were wonderfull glad to heare mee tell the <HI>Gardian</HI> flatly
in his face, I was no <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicke, nor never
thought to be: The other foure <HI>Frankes</HI> were <HI>French∣men,</HI>
two of them <HI>Parisians</HI> old men, the other two of
<HI>Provance,</HI> all foure being Papists: with nine other Com∣mercing
<PB N="237" REF="130"/>
<HI>Frankes,</HI> also that dwelt in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Cyprus,</HI>
most of them being <HI>Venetians,</HI> who were all glad of
mee, shewing themselves so kind, so carefull, so loving,
and so honourable in all respects, that they were as kind
Gentlemen as ever I met withall, especially the <HI>Ger∣mains:</HI>
Such is the love of strangers; when they meete
in forraine and remote places. They had also in high
respect the adventures of my halfe yeares travaile, East,

which was anciently the heart of the old City; and they
have taken on the North side, now both Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI>

by <HI>Sultan Selim:</HI> So that thereby the difference of the

but a man may boldly affirme, that the most part of
this City is builded on that place, where the first <HI>Ierusalem</HI>

without their knowledge; nor yet goe forth without
their triall. This is a memorable note, and worthy of ob∣servation,
that at that time, when the Cities of <HI>Ierusalem</HI>
and <HI>Antiochia</HI> were recovered from the Pagans by the
meanes of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bolloigne;</HI> the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> that

And at the same time, and long thereafter, when <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI>
was re-inthralled and seized upon by <HI>Saladine;</HI> the
Popes name was <HI>Vrbanus;</HI> the Patriarch of <HI>Ierusalem
Heraclius;</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour <HI>Fredericke:</HI> After
<HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Idumean,</HI> sonne to <HI>Antipater,</HI> in whose time
Christ was born: <HI>Archelaus, Agrippa Herod,</HI> who impri∣soned
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iames,</HI> and was eaten of vermine, in
whose time Christ suffered; and <HI>Agrippaminor</HI> (before

(being strange Kings) in the last Kings time <HI>Ieru∣salem</HI>
was overthrowne, and the Kingdome made a Pro∣vince
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, <HI>Anno</HI> 37. After which de∣solation,
the <HI>Iews</HI> were over all the World dispersed; but
afterward in a zealous consideration, were banished from
the most part of the Christian Kingdomes: out of <HI>France</HI>
they were rejected by <HI>Philip</HI> the Faire, <HI>Anno</HI> 1307. out of

the fifth, 1290. out of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sycilia</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the
fifth, 1539. Yet they are found in great numbers in
divers parts of <HI>Germany, Poland,</HI> and in some Cities
of <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>Venice</HI> and her Territories, <HI>Florence</HI> and
the jurisdiction thereof, the principalities of <HI>Parma,
Mantua, Modena, Vrbino,</HI> and their extending limits;
and finally <HI>Rome,</HI> (besides her Ecclesiasticall papacie)
wherein there are no lesse than twenty thousand of them:
<PB N="242" REF="133"/>
They are also innumerable over all the Turkish Domini∣ons,
who so misregard and hate them, for the crucifying
of Christ, that they use to say in detestation of any thing,
<HI>I would I might die a Iew;</HI> neither will they permit a <HI>Iew</HI>
to turn <HI>Turk,</HI> unlesse hee first be baptized: And yet live,
where they will, the most part of them are the wealthiest
people in the world, having subtile, and sublime spirits.
Now for the severall Kings and Rulers of <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Is∣rael,</HI>
beginning at <HI>Moses,</HI> the Judges of the <HI>Iews</HI> were 16,
of whom <HI>Samuel</HI> was the last, at which time, the people

Of the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> there were seventeene,
of whom <HI>Oseas</HI> was the last, in whose time the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI>
were carried captives into <HI>Assyria,</HI> by King <HI>Sal∣manasser.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukes or Governours of <HI>Iewry</HI> were fifteene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dukes of Iewry.</NOTE> of
which <HI>Ioannes Hircanius,</HI> was the last Governour of <HI>Iu∣dea,</HI>
which descended from the stock of <HI>David.</HI> During
the government of which Captains, after the Babylonian
captivity, the Jewish Kingdome was plagued on both
sides, by the Kings of <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Syria:</HI> who slaughte∣red
their people, ransacked their Cities, made havock of
their goods, and compelled them to eat forbidden flesh,
and sacrifice to Idols.</P>
<P>To reforme which enormities <HI>Matathias</HI> and his five
sonnes valiantly resisted, and overcame the impetuous fu∣ry
of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes</HI> and his <HI>Syrians:</HI> Whereupon
the <HI>Iews</HI> chose <HI>Iudas</HI> sirnamed <HI>Machabeus</HI> for their Cap∣taine,
one of the Worlds nine Worthies; who thought
not of the line of <HI>David,</HI> was yet of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="133"/>
The <HI>Machabean</HI> Princes of <HI>Iury</HI> were onely foure:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Machabe∣an</HI> Princes.</NOTE>
<HI>Ioannes Hircanus</HI> the last who was slain by the <HI>Parthians.</HI>
Of the <HI>Machabean</HI> Kings of <HI>Iudah</HI> were other foure, of
whom <HI>Hircanus</HI> sonne to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Tyrant was the
last, who being disturbed in his Reigne by <HI>Aristobulus</HI> his
yonger brother, with his sonnes <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Antio∣chus,</HI>
he was firmly established in his Throne by <HI>Pompey;</HI>
and the other carried captives to <HI>Rome.</HI> But afterward
<HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Antiochus</HI> escaping, the other by favour of
<HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> villanously abused <HI>Hircanus:</HI> The former
was slaine by <HI>Scipio,</HI> and the latter for his villany
was slaine by <HI>Marcus Antonius,</HI> and the Kingdome
given to a stranger, <HI>Herod</HI> borne in <HI>Ascolon</HI> of <HI>Idumea,</HI>
as I formerly recited, of which strange Kings there were
foure.</P>
<P>The Christian Kings of <HI>Palestine,</HI> beginning at <HI>God∣frey</HI>
of <HI>Bulloine</HI> were nine. <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Lysingham</HI> being the
last King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christian Kings of <HI>Ie∣rusalem.</HI></NOTE> and was surprised by <HI>Saladine</HI> of
<HI>Aegypt,</HI> 1187.</P>
<P>And lastly, or at this present time, the Emperours of
the line and race of <HI>Ottoman,</HI> are Lords and Kings over
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the crost, or rather now curst land of <HI>Ca∣naan:</HI>
In whose hands it is faster kept, then the seventeen

<P>But to the intent the Reader may the better conceive,
and plainly understand the Monuments I saw within
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the circumjacent places of <HI>Iudea;</HI> I
thought best to prefixe the description thereof, by the
severall dayes as I saw them, not much condemning,
neither absolutely qualifying them, but shall (as it were)
neutrally nominate, and recapitulate these places, as I
was informed by the <HI>Padre Guardiano, Gaudentius,
<PB N="244" REF="134"/>
Saybantus</HI> a <HI>Veronesen</HI> born; whence hee, and every one
of them every third yeare are changed and recalled backe
to Christendome, and other new Friers sent in their
places: And especially the information of <HI>Iohn Baptista,</HI>
the <HI>Trenchman,</HI> who dwelt and had stayed twenty
five yeares in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and from whom the Friers
themselves have their informations: for a stranger
that understandeth not promptly the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue,
which they usually speake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The igno∣rance of Tra∣vellers.</NOTE> when they demonstrate these
places unto us, hee shall conceive ignorantly, dispose
his judgement blind-foldedly, and knows not how to
distinguish the circumstances and qualities of the things
delivered. As I have knowne some of these <HI>Franks,</HI> in
my company, simply mistaken, even when the exposi∣tion
of every object was largely manifested unto them;
and precisely declared such a thing to have beene there,
although perhaps the matter it selfe, be evanished and
transported.</P>
<P>About two of the clocke on <HI>Palm-sunday</HI> after dinner,
for all of us eat, drunk, and lay in the Monastery, each of
us paying a <HI>Piaster</HI> a day for our diet, sixe shillings ster∣ling,
besides all other costs and charges: The <HI>Guardian</HI> I
say, departed from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> to <HI>Bethphage:</HI> accompa∣nied
with twelve Friers, and many other Orientall Chri∣stians,
which were come thither to that Festivall time, but
I by no means would go, neither would the six <HI>Germans,</HI>
but reposing our selves on the top or platforme of the
Cloyster, wee stayed till their return: And yet from this
place, wee saw their back-comming from <HI>Bethphage</HI> as
they crossed the lower and South side of <HI>Olivet;</HI> deval∣ling
downward, toward the Valley of <HI>Iehosophat</HI> to
ascend Mount <HI>Syon,</HI> for the greater performance of their
foolery.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="134"/>
The ridiculous Ceremony which that day they use, is
thus: In an Apish imitation of Christ, at the foresaid
<HI>Bethphage,</HI> there was an Asse brought to the <HI>Guardiano,</HI>
whereupon hee mounted (being as it were, the greater
Asse, riding upon the lesser) and came riding to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>
the people cutting downe boughs of Trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A superstiti∣ous ceremony▪</NOTE> and also dis∣poyling
themselves almost to the skin, bestrewed the way
as hee rode along, crying, <HI>Hosanna, Hosanna, the Sonne
of</HI> David, <HI>blessed is hee that commeth in the Name of the
Lord:</HI> untill they came to the South gate of <HI>Syon▪</HI> where
the <HI>Guardian</HI> thought to have entred, riding through <HI>Ie∣rusalem</HI>
to his Monastery, with this shouting Convoy of
sixe thousand Orientall Christians, because their Patri∣archs
have not that liberty to doe so, as this <HI>Italian</HI> Guar∣dian:
Notwithstanding, the clamour of the people in∣censed
so the Turkish <HI>Garrison</HI> lying at this Gate, that
they not onely abused the poore Christians in their igno∣rant
devotion, but they pulled the Guardian also from
the Asses backe, beating him most cruelly, and all the
rest of the Friers and Francke Pilgrimes that were with
him: Where at last entring the Covent, most of them
came in groaning, and loaden with blacke and bloody
blowes; whereat I, and the other Protestants, did laugh
in our sleeves to behold their foolish Procession, so sub∣stantially
rewarded. At night after Supper, the <HI>Guardiano</HI>
knowing that I was a Protestant, and also these other <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI>
made an Oration, saying: <HI>You Pilgrims, who refuse
to be participant with us in the Sacraments, nor will not ad∣here
to our Masses, Processions and Ceremonies which we fol∣low
of the Roman Church: I would therfore intreat you (your
liberty being here as much as mine, whereby you may doe as
you please) onely to abstaine from scandaling and mocking
our Rites and ordinary Customes, which at this great Feast
<PB N="246" REF="135"/>
we must perform▪</HI> To which we condescended, and promi∣sed
to give no occasion of offence, seeing our outward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
carriage in going al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng with them to see their customes
tended no way to hurt the inward disposition of our
souls.</P>
<P>In the conclusion of his long Exhortation, he disclosed
this admonition, saying: All of you <HI>Travellers</HI> must in ge∣nerall
be indued with these three worthy gifts, <HI>Faith, Pa∣tience,</HI>
and <HI>Mony: Faith,</HI> to believe these things you shall
see here at and about <HI>Ierusalem: Patience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A flattering beggery.</NOTE> to endure the
apparent injuries of Infidels; and <HI>Money,</HI> to discharge
all Tributes, and costs, which here (meaning in his own
Monastery) and about this City must be defrayed. His
Sermon hee concluded like a Grey Frier, as indeed hee
was: for I am fully perswaded hee little cared for our
Faith, and Patience, providing, that our purses could
answere his expectation, as truly wee found the condigne
triall thereof afterward: making our Patience to startle,
our Faith to over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>top his lyes, and our monies to be a
slave to his greed; and wee left the last tributary spoyles
of two extortionable flatterers, <HI>Avarice,</HI> and <HI>Ignorance;</HI>
with the which our Reverend Guardian was fully inve∣sted.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> early, wee Pilgrimes went forth to view the
Monuments within the City, being accompanied with
the <HI>Padre Viccario,</HI> and a <HI>French Predicatore:</HI> the places
of any note wee saw were these: first they shewed us the
place where Christ appeared to <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> who said:
<HI>Touch mee not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father,
Iohn</HI> 20. 15. and this place by them is supposed to be the
Centre, or middle part of the World. Next, where Saint
<HI>Iames</HI> the first Bishop of the Primitive Church was be∣headed:
then the House of Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI> but that is
<PB N="247" REF="135"/>
doubtfull (say they) because it is not yet confirmed by the
Papall Authoritie: From thence they brought us to the
place where <HI>Annas</HI> one of the High Priests dwelt, and
also the Tree to the which our Saviour was bound, whiles
<HI>Annas</HI> was making himselfe ready to leade him to <HI>Cai∣phas;</HI>
but that I will not believe, for that Tree groweth
yet, being an Olive Tree. They shewed us also the house
where Saint <HI>Peter</HI> was imprisoned, when his fetters were
shaken off his legs, and the prison doores cast open,
and hee relieved: And where <HI>Zebedeus</HI> the Father of
<HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> dwelt, which are nothing but a lump of
Ruines.</P>
<P>Thence we came to the decayed Lodging of <HI>Caiphas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calphas</HI> Lodg∣ing.</NOTE>
without the City, upon the Mount <HI>Syon,</HI> whereupon
there is a Chappell builded, and at the entry of that lit∣tle
<HI>Domo,</HI> wee saw the stone, on which the Cock crew,
when <HI>Peter</HI> denied Christ. Within the same place is the
stone that was rolled to the Sepulcher doore of our Savi∣our,
being now made an Altar to the <HI>Abasines.</HI> These <HI>Aba∣sines,</HI>
are naturally born black, and of them silly Religious
men, who stay at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> in two places, <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> heer at
<HI>Caiphas</HI> House, on mount <HI>Syon,</HI> and the other <HI>Convent</HI> on
mount <HI>Moriah,</HI> where <HI>Abraham</HI> would haue sacrificed
<HI>Isaac:</HI> They wear on their heads flat round Caps of a
blackish colour, and on their bodies long gownes of <HI>white</HI>
Dimmety, or linnen cloath▪ representing Ephods: the
condition of themselves being more devout than un∣derstanding
the true grounds of their devotion, blind
zeale and ignorance overswaying their best light of know∣ledge.
They being a kinde of people which came from
<HI>Prester Iehans</HI> dominions.</P>
<P>And within that Chappel they shewed us <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI>
wherein (say they) Christ was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the night be∣fore
<PB N="248" REF="136"/>
he was brought to the Judgement Hall. Upon the
same side of <HI>Syon,</HI> we saw the place▪ where Christ did
institute the Sacraments: and not far hence, a decayed
House where (say they) the Holy Ghost discended vp∣pon
the Apostles, and also the Sepultures of <HI>David,</HI> and
his sonne <HI>Salomon:</HI> Over the which, their is a <HI>Moskie,</HI>
wherein no Christian may enter, to see these monu∣ments.
For the <HI>Turkes</HI> doe great Reverence, to most of
all the ancient Prophets of the old Testament.</P>
<P>From thence wee returned and entred in <HI>via dolorosa,</HI>
the dolorous way, by which our Lord and Saviour passed
when hee went to be crucified, carrying the Crosse upon
his Back: And at the end of the same street (say they) the
Souldiers met <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Cyrene,</HI> and compelled him to
helpe Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pilats</HI> judge∣ment Hall.</NOTE> to beare his Crosse when hee fainted. <HI>Pilats</HI>
Judgement Hall, is altogether ruinated, having but one∣ly
betweene the two sides of the Lane, an old Arch of
stone, under the which I passed, standing full in the high
Way: Here they shewed us the place, where Christ first
took up his Crosse, and on the top of that Arch, wee saw
that place called <HI>Gabbatha,</HI> where Jesus stood, when <HI>Pilat</HI>
said to the <HI>Iews, Ecce homo.</HI></P>
<P>A little below this, they brought us to the Church of
Saint <HI>Anna,</HI> where (say they) the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was born.
And going down another narrow Lane, they pointed in∣to
a House, and said, hee <HI>Dives</HI> the rich Glutton dwelt▪
who would not give to <HI>Lazarus</HI> the Crums of Bread that
fell from his Table: this I suspend, amongst many other
things, for all hold it to be a Parable, and not a History:
And although it were a History, who can demonstrate the
particular place, <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> having been so often transfor∣med
by alterations.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I must need say, with such lying Wonders, these
<PB N="249" REF="136"/>
flattering <HI>Friers,</HI> bring Strangers into a wonderfull ad∣miration,
and although I rehearse all I saw there, yet I wil
not believe al, onely publishing them as things in different,
some whereof are frivolous, and others some what more
credible: But as I said before I will make no (or very
small) distinction in the Relation.</P>
<P>From thence we came without the Eastern gate, (stan∣ding
on a low Banke, called the daughter of <HI>Syon,</HI> that
over-toppeth the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI>) unto an immove∣able
stone, upon the which they said St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was sto∣ned
to death, the first Martyr of the Christian faith; and
the faithfull fore-runner of many noble followers. As we
returned to our own Convent, they brought us to Mount
<HI>Moriah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Abrahams</HI> faith.</NOTE> and shewed us the place where <HI>Abraham</HI> offered
up <HI>Isaac,</HI> which is in the custody of <HI>Nigroes</HI> or <HI>Aethiopi∣ans:</HI>
to whom each of us payed ten <HI>Madins</HI> of Brasse, the
common coine of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> for our going in to that place.
And the other monastry that these <HI>Abasines</HI> detaine, is on
mount <HI>Sinay</HI> in the Desarts, where the body of S. <HI>Kathe∣rine</HI>
lyeth buried, which is richly maintained, and strong∣ly
kept by the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Emperor: There are 200. Re∣ligious
<HI>Abasines</HI> in it, and 100 souldiers to guard them
from the incursions of <HI>Arabs,</HI> who continually molest
them, because Mount <HI>Sinay</HI> standeth in the midst of that
desolate <HI>Arabian</HI> wildernesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount <HI>Sinay.</HI></NOTE> and far from any civill or in∣habited
place; being distant from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> above 70
English miles. Next they shewed us the place where Iesus
sayd, <HI>Daughters of Ierusalem, mourne not for me, &amp;c.</HI> And
neer unto this, where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> fell into an agony,
when Iesus passed by carrying his Crosse: Also, not farre
hence, we beheld the place, where (as they say) Iesus said
to his mother, <HI>woman, behold thy Sonne,</HI> and to S. <HI>Iohn</HI> be∣hold
<HI>thy mother.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="137"/>
Ascending more upward, they shewed us the House of
<HI>Veronica Sancta,</HI> and said, that our Saviour going by her
door, all in a sweat to Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> shee brought him a
Napkin to wipe his face, which he received, and gave it to
her again: in which (say they) the print of his face remai∣neth
to this day, and is to be seen at <HI>Rome.</HI> It is also said to
be in a Town in <HI>Spain,</HI> and another of them at <HI>Palermo</HI> in
<HI>Sicilia:</HI> wherefore I believe the one, as well as the rest.</P>
<Q><L>So out of one, if Papists can make three</L>
<L>By it, they would denote <HI>Heavens Deitie:</HI></L>
<L>But O! not so, these three revolv'd in one,</L>
<L>Points forth the Pope, from him his tripled Crown</L>
<L>He weav'd these Napkins, lying rear'd his seat,</L>
<L>For which this number makes his number great.</L></Q>
<P>As concerning the Temple of the most High, built by
<HI>Salomon</HI> (the description of which edifice yee may read in
the 3 of <HI>Kings</HI>) it was destroyed by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> at the
taking of <HI>Ierusalem, Anno Mundi,</HI> 4450. Secondly, it was
rebuilded again by the commandement of <HI>Cyrus</HI> King of
<HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temple of <HI>Salomon</HI> thrice builded and destroyed.</NOTE> after the <HI>Iews</HI> returned from the Captivity of <HI>Baby∣lon;</HI>
but not answerable to the state and magnificence of
the former: For besides the poverty and smalnesse of it,
there wanted five things which were in the other: First, the
Ark of the <HI>Covenant:</HI> Secondly, the pot of <HI>Manna:</HI> Third∣ly,
the rod of <HI>Aaron:</HI> Fourthly, the two Tables of the <HI>Law,</HI>
written by the finger of God: And fifthly, the fire of the
Sacrifice, which came down from Heaven, which were the
<HI>Symbols</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adges of Gods favour and mercy shown to
them, and their forefathers in his covenant of Love.</P>
<P>This Temple afterward growing in decay, <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great, (that killed the young Infants for Christs sake,
<PB N="251" REF="137"/>
who suffered for him, before he suffered for them) built
another much inferiour to the first, and superiour to the
second. And although some Authors would have him but
to repaire the second Temple, yet it is most certaine, he
did even from the foundation raise its greatest beauty
and glory. For this <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Ascolinite,</HI> was an <HI>Edo∣mite</HI>
stranger, or <HI>Idumean,</HI> who having gotten the King∣dome
contrary to the Law of <HI>Moses;</HI> and created King
of <HI>Iewry</HI> by <HI>Octavius Augustus;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herods</HI> the <HI>Idumean</HI> Tem∣ple.</NOTE> and knowing these peo∣ple
to be offended therewithall, to procure their fa∣vour
did build to them a third Temple: This was it, in
which our Saviour, and his Apostles did daily Preach;
and was set on fire by <HI>Titus</HI> the tenth day of <HI>August;</HI>
on which day likewise the first Temple, was burnt by <HI>Ne∣buchadnezzar.</HI>
And lastly, there is another great Temple
builded in the same place, by <HI>Sultan, Selim Seliman,</HI>
reserved by <HI>Turkes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Selim Selymans</HI> Temple.</NOTE> and highly regarded, for that respect
they carry to <HI>Salomon;</HI> neare the which, or within whose
Courts no Christian may enter under the paine of loosing
his head.</P>
<P>This present Temple hath two incircling Courts in∣vironed
with high wals, hauing two entires: in the inner
Court standeth the Temple, that is composed of five cir∣cling
and large Rotundotes, rising high and incorporate
from the ground with round tops: The outward fabrick
whereof we cannot see, save on Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> which is
over against the Citie, and twice as high as Mount
<HI>Sion.</HI></P>
<P>These are all the monuments which in one day, I saw
within <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> but as for Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> and the <HI>Ho∣ly
Grave,</HI> I saw them afterward, which in their owne
place shall be orderly touched. As we were spending that
day in these sights, the <HI>Guardian</HI> had prepared one hun∣dred
<PB N="252" REF="138"/>
souldiers, sixty Hors-men, and forty Foot-men, to
take with him the day following, for his conduction to
<HI>Iordan,</HI> and the Mountaine in the Wildernesse where
Christ fasted; which is his usuall custome once every yeare
between <HI>Palme Sunday</HI> and <HI>Easter,</HI> returning again before
<HI>Good-friday.</HI> These places cannot be viewed, save onely
at that time; neither may a Pilgrime goe along with the
Souldiers, unlesse hee give the value of seven Crownes or
Piasters (as a propine unto the Lievtenant, being forty
two shillings sterling: and if the Traveller will not goe to
that charge, hee may stay there till their return, which
I would not wish him to doe, if possibly hee may spare
the money, for the sight of <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Iordans</HI> sake.
That same night after supper, The <HI>Guardian</HI> demanded
of us Travellers, if wee would goe with him to see these
memorable, and singular things, upon the former condi∣tion:
To whom wee answered in a generall consent, wee
would, and so payed our moneys.</P>
<P>Early upon <HI>Tuesday</HI> morning all the Friers and Pilgrims
being mounted on Mules save onely pedestriall I,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Voyage to <HI>Iordan.</HI></NOTE> and
two M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les loaden with our provision of victuals; we de∣parted
from the City, about nine of the clocke in the
forenoone, keeping our faces South-east, and leaving
<HI>Bethphage</HI> and <HI>By<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hania</HI> on our left hand, wee had plea∣sant
travelling for seven miles; but in the afternoon wee
entred in a barren and desart Countrey till Sun-setting:
where at last wee arrived at a standing Well, and there
refreshing our selves and the beasts, wee reposed till two
hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es within night. After that the Captaine had cryed
<HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anga,</HI> that is, match away: we set forward, being
well gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded round about with our Keepers, because we
entred into a dangerous way, and a most desolate and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣bulous
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="138"/>
In all this deformed Countrey, wee saw neither
House, nor Village, for it is altogether desartuous, and
inhabited onely by wild Beasts, and naked <HI>Arabians.</HI>
Before wee came neere to <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> by se∣ven
miles: (for so wee behooved to passe by the East end
of it, before wee could arrive at that place of <HI>Iordan</HI>
which wee intended) we I say incountred with such deep
sandy ground, that the Mulets were not able to carry
our Company through: Whereupon they all dismoun∣ted,
wrestling, and wading above the middle part of their
bodies, and sometimes falling in over their heads, they
were in great danger of perishing, although the robust∣nesse
of my body carried mee through on my feete, re∣lieving
also divers times some of these <HI>Friers</HI> and Pil∣grimes,
that were almost choaked and over-whelmed
with Sand, but not for lacke of <HI>Wine.</HI> Even in the mid∣dest
of this turmoyling paine, (the night being darke) the
unwelcomed <HI>Arabs,</HI> environed and invaded us with a
storme of Arrows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fearfull danger.</NOTE> which they sent from the tops of lit∣tle
hard hils, whereupon they stood, for knowing the
advantage of the ground they took opportunity to give
the more fearfull assaults; yet they prevailed nothing (al∣though
they wounded some of our souldiers) such was
the resolute Courage of our valorous Defendants.
True it is, that in all my travailes I was never so sore fa∣tigated,
nor more fearefully indangered, as I was that
night▪</P>
<P>A little after midnight, these Savages leaving us, and
we leaving our troublesome way, wee accoasted the Lake
of <HI>Sodome,</HI> and marched along the marine shoare above
nine miles before we came to <HI>Iordan.</HI> This Lake is ca∣led
<HI>Lacus Asphaltites,</HI> it yieldeth a kinde of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, named
<HI>Bitumen Asphaltum;</HI> the which bituminous savour no
<PB N="254" REF="139"/>
living thing can indure. And now <HI>Mare mortuum,</HI> a Sea
because it is salt, and <HI>mortuum</HI> or dead, for that no li∣ving
thing breeds therein: and more properly for this
cause called the dead Sea, because of it selfe it is unmove∣able,
such is the Leprosie and stability of the water. It is
also called so, because if a Bird flie over it, she present∣ly
falleth downe therein dead: And as <HI>Salomon</HI> repor∣teth
of it, <HI>Wisdome</HI> 10. 7. it smoketh continually: from
whence proceedeth filthy Vapours, which deforme the
fields, lying about for certaine miles, as it were blasted,
scorched, and made utterly barren: this smoake I take
onely to be but the exhalation of <HI>Iordan:</HI> For this River
falling into it, and there ending his course, the two con∣trary
natures cannot agree; the one being a filthy puddle,
and the other a pure water, as I shall more approbably
record.</P>
<P>This Lake is foure score miles in length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The length of <HI>Sodo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Lake.</NOTE> and according
to its intervalling Circuite, sometimes two, three, foure,
or five miles in breadth: yet the body thereof; bending
directly South-west; keepeth a glassie course, till it salute
the austere conspicuosity of the fabulous and stony De∣sarts:
being compassed with the Rockes of <HI>Arabia Pe∣trea</HI>
on the South: On the North, with the sandy Hils of
the Wildernesse of <HI>Iudea:</HI> on the West, with the steepy
Mountaines of <HI>Arabia deserta:</HI> and on the East, with
the plaine of <HI>Iericho.</HI> How commeth it to passe there∣fore,
that the fresh running flood of <HI>Iordan,</HI> falling ever∣more
into this bounded Sea, that the Lake it selfe, never
diminisheth, nor increaseth, but alwayes standeth at one
fulnesse: neither hath it any issuing forth, nor reboun∣deth
backwards on the plaine of <HI>Iericho,</HI> which is one
of the greatest Wonders in the World. Wherefore, as I
have said, it must needs either exhale to the Clouds,
<PB N="255" REF="139"/>
or otherwise runne downe to <HI>Hell:</HI> for if it ranne under
the Rockes, and so burst in the Desarts, it would soone
bee knowne; but in all the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unds of <HI>Arabia Deserta,</HI>
which betwixt this Lake and the Red Sea, extend to 300
miles; there is no such matter, as Brooke, or strand, much
lesse a River, neyther hath it any intercourse with the
Ocean, unlesse it runne through some secret passage of
the earth under the Wildernesse, unto the Red Sea. And
that is doubtfull, although it may appeare probable, in
regard of <HI>Nilus,</HI> that runneth a hundred miles under
the ground in the exterior <HI>Aethiopia:</HI> and divers other
Rivers also after the same manner, obscuring themselues
under Rockes, Mountaines, and planures for many
miles: which particulars, by my owne experience, I could
denote.</P>
<P>But as for this River, the question may arise, whether
ran it during the time of these five Cities of the plaine
now ouerwhelmed with Water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The doubt∣fulnes of <HI>Ior∣dans</HI> ending.</NOTE> or where was the issue
thereof. To this I answere, was not the hand of the
Almighty, that rained downe from the Heavens Fire
and Brimstone to consume them, able also, to drowne
their situatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and intervalling plaines with water: Yes
and doubtlesse yes, and the course of the River keeping
still its former condition: And for moderne examples,
how many Cities, Mansions, and Stations, have beene
sommerssed with water: nay innumerable, and so remay∣ning
to this day, place, beauty, and being, all defaced:
As now in Scotland neere to <HI>Falkirk,</HI> rests the last and
latest memory of such woefull accidents, and superaboun∣ding
disgorgings.</P>
<P>It breedeth nor reserveth no kinde of fishes; and if by
the swelling of <HI>Iordan,</HI> any fishes be carried to it, they
immediately dye. Although <HI>Iosephus</HI> witnesseth that in
<PB N="256" REF="140"/>
his time, there was an Apple grew upon the banks there∣of,
like to the colour of gold, and within was rotten, and
would consume to powder; yet I affirme now the con∣trary:
For there is not such a thing (whatsoever hath bin
in his days) as either Trees, or Bushes, grow neere to <HI>So∣dom</HI>
by three miles: such is the consummation of that pe∣stiferous
Gulf.</P>
<P>Divers Authors have reported, that nothing will sinke
into it, of any reasonable weight, as dead men, or car∣kasses
of beasts: but by experience I approve the con∣trary:
For it beareth nothing at all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wrong infor∣mations made.</NOTE> yea, not the weight
of a Feather, nor the pile of withered Grasse, but it will
sinke therein, with the which my hands made sundry
trials; and dare approve it to be of truth, in spight of
the lying World, and all doting varieties of ancient Re∣lations.</P>
<P>The water it selfe, is of a blackish colour, and at some∣times
in the yeere, there are terrible shapes, and shews of
terrour in it, as I was informed at <HI>Iericho</HI> by the <HI>Arabian</HI>
inhabitants there, which is the neerest Town that borde∣reth
thereupon.</P>
<P>This contagious and pestilentious Lake of <HI>Sodom,</HI> re∣sembleth
much (as may be supposed) that infernall Gulfe
of Hell: but in my opinion, I hold it to be the purgato∣ry
of Papists: for they say <HI>Limbus Patrum</HI> is neere, or in
the second roome to Hell, which I thinke must needs
be <HI>Sodome:</HI> for although it be not Hell it selfe, yet I am
perswaded, it is a second Hell, having (as some report) no
bottome. Wherefore I conclude thus, that since Papists
will have a purgatory, I absolutely affirme, it must be
such a purgatory, as the purging of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomor∣rah,</HI>
which was with fire and brimstone, to their de∣struction.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="140"/>
About the breake of day on Wensday morning, wee
past by the ruines of an old house; where (as they say) S.
<HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist remained, when he baptized those that
came from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and other Regions about; which is
but the flight of an arrow from <HI>Iordan.</HI></P>
<P>Approaching to the banke-side wee dismounted, and
uncloathed our selues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Iordan.</HI></NOTE> going in naked to the River, wee
washed us to refresh our bodies; our Souldiers lying a
little off from us, as pledges of our lives and their owne
safegards, stayed as Bulwarks for our protection, &amp; a con∣nivall
obligation for two repugnant defences: Time pre∣senting
the awfull opportunity of both occasions. In this
place, as the <HI>Guardian</HI> said, was <HI>Christ</HI> baptized of Saint
<HI>Iohn,</HI> when the Holy Ghost came downe in a bodily
shape, like a <HI>Dove</HI> upon him, and their was a voyce from
Heaven, saying: <HI>Thou art my beloved Sonne, in Thee I am
well pleased.</HI> I saw also an apparant like testimony, of a
quadrangled stone, lying on the bank side; where upon are
ingraven letters of <HI>Hebrew, Greeke, Latine,</HI> testifying the
same thing: and may be also conjectured, in regard of the
auncient Habitacle, of that precursor, which is not far
from thence.</P>
<P>This river <HI>Iordan</HI> beginneth in Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> of two
fountaines, <HI>Iore,</HI> and <HI>Dan,</HI> which run separated till they
come to the lake <HI>Maronah;</HI> &amp; hence it maketh one body,
keeping his course, through the lake <HI>Genasereth,</HI> endeth in
<HI>Sodome.</HI> The river <HI>Tibris</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> &amp; <HI>Iordan</HI> are not much
different in quantity and colour; and not unlike other in
their courses: For <HI>Iordan</HI> falleth in the old <HI>Gomorah,</HI> and
<HI>Tibris</HI> runneth through the new <HI>Sodome.</HI> A history of
such evidence, as travell taught me by experience: For it
is the Priests confluence, which breeds in the <HI>Italians</HI> in∣solence:
if I erre, I will beg indulgence, of the Popes au∣reat
magnificence.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="141"/>
The Rivers themselves are both of a muddy colour, and
their quantity not far different from other, which <HI>Iordan</HI>
for greatnesse retaineth, and the length of their courses
are much semblable to other. The water of <HI>Iordan</HI> hath
beene transported to <HI>Venice</HI> in barrels, for that purity it
hath; which will reserve unspoiled, both moneths and
yeares, and the longer it is kept, it is the more fresher;
and to drink it, is an excellent remedy for the Fever <HI>quar∣tan</HI>
or <HI>quotidian,</HI> being neere in vertue to the Wine of
<HI>Libanon.</HI></P>
<P>Considering the ancient reputation of this famous Ri∣ver,
and the rare sight of such an unfrequented place, I
climbed up to the top of a <HI>Turpentine</HI> Tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Turpentine Rod brought from <HI>Iordan,</HI> and given to King <HI>Iames.</HI></NOTE> which grew
within the limited flood, a little above where I left my
company even naked, as I came from swimming, and cut
down a fair hunting Rod of the heavy and sad <HI>Turpen∣tine</HI>
Tree, being three yards long, wondrous straight, full
of small knots, and of a yellowish colour; which after∣ward,
with great pains, I brought to <HI>England,</HI> and did
present it (as the rarest Jem of a Pilgrimes treasure) to
his Majesty. But I remember in the choosing thereof an
unexpected accident fell out: For I being sequestrate from
the sight of the company, upon this solitary Tree, with
broad obscuring leaves, the Friers and Souldiers remo∣ved;
keeping their course towards <HI>Iericho:</HI> but within
two furlongs from <HI>Iordan,</HI> they were beset with the for∣mer
<HI>Nocturnall</HI> Enemies, who assailed them with a hard
conflict: For I hearing the Harquebuse go off, was straight
in admiration, and looking down to the place where I
left my associates, they were gone; so bending my eyes a
little further in the Plain, I saw them at a martiall com∣bate:
which sight gave mee suddenly, the threatning of
despaire: not knowing whether to stay intrenched, with∣in
<PB N="259" REF="141"/>
the circumdating leaves, to approove the events of my
auspicuous fortunes: Or in prosecuting a relief, to be par∣ticipant
of their doubtfull deliverance. In the end pon∣dering,
I could hardly, or neuer escape their hands, either
there, or by the way going up to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> leapt downe
from the tree, leaving my <HI>Turkish</HI> cloathes lying upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ground, tooke onely in my hand the rod &amp; <HI>Shasse</HI> which
I wore on my head; and ranne starke naked above a
quarter of a mile amongst thistles, and sharpe pointed
grasse, which pittifully be pricked the soles of my feete,
but the feare of death for the present expel'd the griefe
of that unlooked for paine. Approaching on the safe
side of my company, one of our Souldiers broak forth
on horsebacke, being determined to kill mee for my
staying behind: Yea, and three times stroke at mee with
his halfe-pike; but his horse being at his speede, I pre∣vented
his cruelty, first by falling downe, next by run∣ning
in amongst the thickest of the Pilgrimes, recove∣ring
the <HI>Guardians</HI> face, which when the <HI>Guardian</HI> espi∣ed;
and saw my naked body, hee presently pulled off his
gray gowne, and threw it to me whereby I might hide the
secrets of nature: By which meanes (in the space of an
houre) I was cloathed three manner of wayes: First, like
a <HI>Turke:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pilgrims three severall habits in half an houre.</NOTE> Secondly, like a wild <HI>Arabian:</HI> And thirdly, like
a grey <HI>Frier,</HI> which was a barbarous, a savage and a re∣ligious
habit.</P>
<P>The Captaine at last entring in parley with the <HI>Arabs,</HI>
by some contributing promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es did mitigate their fury▪
for their compounded acknowledgment was to be sent
them from <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> Whereupon, wee marching to∣ward
<HI>Iericho,</HI> reposed our selves under a cooling shade,
and dined there on the Wine and provision which we car∣ried
with us.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="142"/>
After Dinner wee arose, and went to the House of <HI>Za∣cheus:</HI>
(this was hee who sate uppon a Tree to see our
<HI>Saviour</HI> as he passed by,) the Wals whereof stand to this
day, the tecture being onely demolished. This new
<HI>Iericho</HI> is now a poore Village onely of mine dwelling
Houses, inhabited by a kinde of <HI>Arabs</HI> (which are in
subiection under the Governour of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI>) but I saw
many ruinous lumpes of the Wals, and demolishings of
the old Towne, which is a little from this distant, about
a short quarter of a mile. Here I saw two most dainty
kinde of fruits, the one was a little lesse then an Ap∣ple,
but more round: whose colour was like gold with∣out,
and within it was White as <HI>Snow,</HI> and sweete like
Sugar.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two sorts of rare fruits.</NOTE> I would gladly haue eaten of them; but the
<HI>Friers</HI> forbade me, saying they were the onely pest of
Death unto a stranger. The other Apple was like to a
greene Lemmon, long, and full of knots, of a reddish co∣lour,
like to a Mellon; being both delicate and whole∣some,
of which wee did eate to satisfie the naturall ap∣petite,
and so did all our Souldiers eate of them exces∣sively:
their Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s growing high and greene by a Brooke
side of delicate Water that runneth from the fountaine of
<HI>Elizeus.</HI> From <HI>Iericho</HI> we set forward, in the way of
the Wildernesse; our determination being such, as to
view the mountaine whereon <HI>Christ</HI> fasted forty dayes:
where arriued, being la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, we durst not go up til morning,
Wherefore we pitched that night by the fountaine of <HI>E∣lizeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Elizeus</HI> Foun∣tain.</NOTE>
the Water of which, was of old naturally bitter,
but by the prayers of that divine Prophet, was restored
to a sweet tast: It is good for digestion, and harmlesse for
health; and it is the lightest water the earth yeelds; having
on the morrow filled a Boares skin of it, to carry with me
to the mountain; I found it so light, that I had no weight
<PB N="261" REF="142"/>
nor pain in the bearing of it on my shoulders: notwith∣standing,
the way of it self was fastidious. This mountain
is called <HI>Quarantanam,</HI> or <HI>Quaranto,</HI> being of height, by
the computation of my painfull experience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fasted forty days▪</NOTE> above sixe
miles, and groweth from the bottome still smaller and
smaller, till that the top is covered with a little Chappell,
not unlike to the proportion of a <HI>Pyramede.</HI></P>
<P>There is no way to ascend upon this Hill, save one,
which hath been hewen out of the Rock by the industry
of men, experimented in Masonry; (which was done at
the cost of Queene <HI>Helen</HI>) going up by the Degrees of
forty five turns. In all our Company there were onely one
<HI>Frier,</HI> foure <HI>Germans,</HI> and I, that durst attempt to climbe
the Mountain.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> early at the breake of day, wee sixe made us
for the Mountaine, leaving our Souldies to guard the
passage below, lest some stragling <HI>Arabs</HI> should have
stolne after us for our Destruction. Where after divers
turnings, traversings, and narrow foot passages, having
come with great difficulty to the top, wee entred first into
a umbragious Cave, joyning to, and under the Chappell,
where the <HI>Frier</HI> told us, that in this place <HI>Christ</HI> did fast
forty dayes: and here it was, where hee rebuked Sathan.
The Chappell which covereth the top of this high and
steepy R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck is covered, and also beautified, with an old
Altar: between the outward sides whereof, and the craggy
face of this Mountain, two men may only go side to side:
Here wee di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and refresht our selves with water that I
carried on my back hither: From which place we saw the
most part of all the Holy Land, except the North parts of
<HI>Iudea, Palestine,</HI> and <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> and a great way in the two
<HI>Arabiaes, Petrea,</HI> and <HI>Deserta,</HI> and all the length of <HI>Iordan,</HI>
even from <HI>Sodom</HI> to <HI>Maronah.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="143"/>
At last in our Returne and fearfull descending, there
would none of us go down foremost: For although the
<HI>Frier</HI> led us freely upwards, yet first downward for his
life he durst not go: and that because at the narrow end of
every turning, there was aye betweene the upper and the
lower passage, about my height, and some were twice my
height, of the flat face of the Rocke, whereon there was
nothing but dimples and holes to receive our feet, which
in descending was perillous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dreadful dan∣ger in descen∣ding the Qua∣rantaram.</NOTE> Now the greatest danger, at
every turn, was in the down going of the foremost, who
was to receive them all, one by one, and foot their
feet in the shallow dimples: of which if any of them had
missed, his sliding down had miscarried them both over
the Rock.</P>
<P>Now for the noble <HI>Germans</HI> sake, two of whom were
great Barons, <HI>Signior Strowse,</HI> and <HI>Signior Crushen,</HI> and
borne Vassalls to the Marquesse of <HI>Hanspauch,</HI> I resolved
to imbrace the danger: Where downe I went, receiving
every one of them, at every turne, first leading their
feet by my hands, and then by inveloping them with
mine arms: Well, having past halfe way downwards,
wee came to the most scurrile and timorous Discent of
the whole passage, where with much difficulty, I set safe
the foure <HI>Germans</HI> in our narrow Rode hewen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of
the craggie Hill; and then was to receive the <HI>Frier:</HI>
Whence he comming downe from above, with his bel∣ly
and face to the Rocke, holding his hands grumbling
above, the fellow fell on trembling; and as I was pla∣cing
his feet in the holes, distempered feare brought
him downe upon mee with a rushling hurle: Whereupon
straight I mainly closed with my left arme his body fast
to the Rock, keeping strongly my right shoulder to the
same place: For I could not have saved my selfe, and
<PB N="263" REF="143"/>
letting him fall, but he would have caught me head-long
with him, over the Rock: And yet the <HI>Germans</HI> cried still
to me, <HI>Lascia ti quel furfanto cascar alla fondo conil Diavo∣lo,
esalva caro fratello la vita vostra,</HI> viz. <HI>Let that Villaine
fall to the ground with the Divell, and save, O deare brother,
your own life:</HI> But I neither would nor durst: at last his
feare, by my incouragement having left him, I suffered
him to slide s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ftly down between my arme and the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,
to the solid path: Where by and by, hee fell downe upon
his knees, and gave me a thousand blessings, vowing for
this, hee would do me a great good deed before I left <HI>Ie∣rusalem.</HI></P>
<P>At last towards the afternoon, wee safely arrived at the
foot of the Mountaine, and having saluted the <HI>Guardian,</HI>
and all the rest, who then were ready to take journey, the
<HI>Frier</HI> told his Reverence how I had saved his life: Where∣upon
the <HI>Guardian,</HI> and the other <HI>Friers,</HI> did imbrace
mee kindly in their arms, giving mee many earnest and lo∣ving
thanks.</P>
<P>And now the Souldiers and we being advanced in our
Way, as wee returned to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> wee marched by an
old Ruinous Abbey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint <HI>Ierom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Abbey.</NOTE> where (say they) Saint <HI>Ierome</HI>
dwelt, and was fed there by wilde Lions: Having tra∣vailed
sore and hard that afternoone, wee arrived at <HI>Ie∣rusalem</HI>
an houre within night, for the Gate was kept o∣pen
a purpose for us and our <HI>Guard:</HI> and entring our Mo∣nastery,
wee supped, and rested our selves till midnight;
having marched that halfe day, more then 34 miles. A
little before midnight, the <HI>Guardian</HI> and the <HI>Friers,</HI> were
making themselves ready to go with us to the Church
of the <HI>Holy Sepulchre,</HI> called <HI>Sancto Salvatore;</HI> where
we were to stay <HI>Good-friday</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> and <HI>Easter-Sunday</HI>
till mid-night: They tooke their Cooke with
<PB N="264" REF="144"/>
them also to dresse our Diet, carrying Wine, Bread,
Fishes, and Fruits hither in abundance. Mean while, a
<HI>Iew,</HI> the <HI>Trench-man</HI> of the <HI>Turkish Sanzacke,</HI> came to
the Monastery, and received from every one of us <HI>Pil∣grimes,</HI>
first two Chickeens of Gold for our severall
heads, and entry at <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> and then nine Chickeens a
piece, for our in going to the <HI>Holy Grave;</HI> and a Chickeen
of gold a man, to himselfe the <HI>Iew,</HI> as being due to his
place.</P>
<P>Thus was there twelve Chickeens from each of us dis∣patched
for the <HI>Turke:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our tributes for the Holy Grave.</NOTE> And last one, and all of us, beho∣ved
to give to the <HI>Guardian</HI> two Chickeens also for the
Waxe Candles and Fooleries he was to spend in their idle
and superstitious Ceremonies, these three aforesaid
nights: which amounted in all to every one of us, to
fourteen Chickeens of gold, six pounds six shillings ster∣ling.
So that in the whole from the six <HI>Germans,</HI> foure
<HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and nine commercing <HI>Franks</HI> in <HI>Cyprus</HI> and
<HI>Syria, Venetians</HI> and <HI>Ragusans,</HI> and from my selfe, the
summe arose for this nights labour to a hundred and
twenty six pounds <HI>sterling.</HI></P>
<P>This done, and at full mid-night wee came to the
Church, where wee found twelve Venerable like <HI>Turkes,</HI>
readie to receive us, sitting in the Porch without the
Doore; who forthwith opened at randon the two
great Brazen halfes of the Doore, and received us very
respectively: We being within, the doore made fast, and
the <HI>Turks</HI> returned to the Castle, the first place of any
note wee saw, was the place of Unction, which is a foure
squared stone; inclosed about with an iron Revele, on
which (say they) the dead body of our Saviour lay, and
was imbalmed; after hee was taken from the Crosse,
whiles <HI>Ioseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea,</HI> was preparing that new <HI>Se∣pulcher</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="144"/>
for him wherein never man lay: from thence wee
came to the holy Grave. Leaving Mount <HI>Calvary</HI> on our
right hand toward the East end of the Church; for they
are both contained within this glorious edifice.</P>
<P>The Holy Grave is covered with a little Chappell,
standing within a round Quiere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Grave.</NOTE> in the west end of the
Church: It hath two low and narrow entries: as wee
entred the first doore, three after three, and our shooes
cast off, for these two roomes are wondrous little, the
<HI>Guardiano</HI> fell downe, <HI>ingenochiato,</HI> and kissed a stone,
whereupon (hee said) the Angell stood, when <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI> came to the Sepulchre, to know if Christ was
risen, on the third day as he promised: And within the
entry of the second doore, wee saw the place where
Christ our Messias was buried, and prostrating our selves
in great humility, every man according to his Religion,
offered up his prayers to God.</P>
<P>The Sepulcher it selfe, is eight foote and a halfe in
length, and advanced about three foote in height from
the ground, and three foote five inches broad, being co∣vered
with a faire Marble stone of white colour.</P>
<P>In this Chappell, and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it, I meane without the
utter sides of it, and the inward incirclings of the com∣passing
Quiere, there are alwayes burning above fifty
Lampes of oyle, maintained by Christian Princes, who
stand most of them within incircling bands of pure
Gold, which is exceeding sumptuous; having the names
of those, who sent or gave them, ingraven upon the up∣per
edges of the round circles: each of them having
three degrees, and each degree depending upon ano∣ther,
with supporters of pure Gold, rich and glo∣rious.
The fairest whereof was sent thither by King
<HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> whereon I saw his Name, his Title,
<PB N="266" REF="145"/>
and Crowne curiously indented, I demanded the <HI>Guar∣diano</HI>
if any part of the Tombe was here yet extant, who
replied, there was, but because (said he) Christians re∣sorting
thither, being devoutly moved with affection to
the place, carried away a good part thereof, which cau∣sed
S. <HI>Helen</HI> inclose it under this stone; whereby some
relicts of it should alwayes remaine. I make no doubt but
that same place is <HI>Golgotha,</HI> where the holy Grave was,
as may appeare by the distance, betweene Mount <HI>Calvary</HI>
and this sacred Monument; which extendeth to forty of
my paces: This Chappell is outwardly decored, with
15 coupell of Marble Pillars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The glorious Chappell of the Holy Grave.</NOTE> and of 22 foote high; and
above the upper coverture of the same Chappell, there is
a little six-angled Turret made of Cedar wood, cove∣red
with Lead, and beautified with sixe small Columnes
of the same tree. The chappell it selfe standeth in a de∣micircle
or halfe Moone, having the little doore or entry
looking East, to the great body of the Church, and to
Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> being opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>site to many other venerable
monuments of memorable majesties.</P>
<P>The forme of the Quier wherein it standeth, is like
unto the ancient <HI>Rotundo</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> but a great deale
higher and larger, having two gorgeous Galleries; one
above another, and adorned with magnificent Columnes,
being open at the top, with a large round; which yeel∣deth
to the heavens, the prospect of that most sacred
place.</P>
<P>In which second Gallery we strangers reposed all these
three nights we remayned there: whence wee had the full
prospect of all the spacious Church, and all the Orientall
people were there at this great feast of <HI>Easter</HI> day, being
about 6000 persons: from this curious carved Chappell
wee returned through the Church to Mount <HI>Calvary▪</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="145"/>
To which wee ascended by 21 steps, 18 of them were of
Marble, and three of Cedar-wood: where, when we came
I saw a most glorious and magnifick roome, whose covert
was supported all about with rich Columnes of the <HI>Por∣phyre</HI>
stone, and the over-seelings loaden with <HI>Mosaicke</HI>
work, and over-gilded with gold, the floor being curious∣ly
indented with intermingled <HI>Alablaster</HI> &amp;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The beauty of Mount <HI>Calvary.</HI></NOTE> black shining
<HI>Parangone:</HI> On my left hand I saw a platform'd Rock, all
covered with thick and ingraven boards of silver; and in
it a hole of a cubits deep, in which (say they) the Crosse
stood whereon our Saviour was crucified: And on every
side therof a hole for the good and bad thieves, were then
put to death with him. Descending from Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI>
we came to the Tombe of <HI>Godfrey du Bulloine,</HI> who was
the first proclaimed Christian King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and re∣fused
to be crowned there, saying; It was not decent, the
servants head should be crowned with gold, where the
Masters head had been crowned with thorns; having this
Inscription ingraven on the one side:</P>
<P>Hic jacet inclytus <HI>Godfridus de Bullion,</HI> qui t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tam hanc
terram acquisivit cultui divino,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two famous Sepulchres.</NOTE> cujus anima requiescat in
pace.</P>
<P>And over against it, is the Tombe of King <HI>Baldwine</HI> his
brother, which hath these Verses in golden Letters curi∣ously
indented.</P>
<Q><L>Rex <HI>Baldevinus, Judas</HI> alter <HI>Machabeus</HI></L>
<L>Spes patriae, Vigor Eccl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siae, Virtus, utriusque;</L>

<L><HI>Caesar,</HI> Aegypti Dan, ac homicida Damasus;</L>
<L>Proh dolor! in modico clauditur hoc Tumulo.</L></Q>
<P>The other things within the Church they shewed us,
were these, a Marble Pillar, whereunto (say they) our
<PB N="268" REF="146"/>
Saviour was bound, when hee was whipped, and scourged
for our sakes: the place is a low Celler, about fourteene
stone degrees under the ground, where the Crosse was
hid by the <HI>Iewes,</HI> and found againe by S. <HI>Helen:</HI> the place
where Christ was crowned with thornes, which is reser∣ved
by the <HI>Abasines,</HI> and where the Souldiers cast lots for
his Garment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where Christ was nailed to the Crosse.</NOTE> the place where he was imprisoned, whiles
they were making of his Crosse, and where the Crosse,
being laid along upon the ground, our Saviour was nailed
fast to it; the Rocke, which (as they say) rent at his Cru∣cifying,
which is more likely to be done with hammers:
and set one peece a foote from another, for the slit lookes,
as if it had bin cleft with wedges and beetles. And yet the
sacred Scriptures say that it was not a Rock, but the Tem∣ple
that did rent in two from the bottome to the top,
wherein these silly soule-sunke Friers are meerely blinded,
understanding no more than leying traditions; perfiting
this their nationall Proverb;
<Q><L>Con arte, et con inganno, ci vivono medzo l' anno</L>
<L>Con inganno et con arte, ci vivono l' altera parte.</L>
<L>With guile and craft, they live the one halfe yeare</L>
<L>With craft and guile, the other halfe as cleare.</L></Q></P>
<P>And lastly, they take upon them below <HI>Calvary</HI> to shew
us where the head of <HI>Adam</HI> was buried. These and many
other things, are so doubtfull, that I doe not register them
for truth (I meane in demonstrating the particular places)
but onely relates them as I was informed.</P>
<P>There are seven sorts of Nations, different in Religion,
and Language, who continually (induring life) remaine
within this Church, having incloystered lodgings joy∣ning
to the walls thereof: their victuals are brought daily
to them by their familiars, receiving the same at a great
hole in the Church doore; for the <HI>Turkes</HI> seldome open
<PB N="269" REF="146"/>
the entry unlesse it be when Pilgrimes come, save one
houres space onely every <HI>Saturday</HI> in the afternoon, and
at some extraordinary Festivall days: and yet it doth not
stand open then, but onely opened to let strangers in
and shut again: For this purpose each family have a Bell
fastned at their lodging, with a string reaching from
thence to the Church-doore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven religi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Families.</NOTE> the end whereof hangeth
outwardly; By the which commoditie, each furnisher
ringing the Bell, giveth warning to his friends, to come
to receive their necessaries, for through the body of the
Church they must come to the porch-doore, and returne
from it to the Cloyster.</P>
<P>The number of those, who are tied to this austere life,
are about three hundred and fifty persons, being <HI>Itali∣ans,
Greeks, Armenians, Aethiopians, Iacobins,</HI> a sort of cir∣cumcised
<HI>Christians, Nestorians,</HI> and <HI>Chelfains</HI> of <HI>Mesopo∣tamia.</HI></P>
<P>The day before the Resurrection, about the houre of
mid-night, the whole Sects and sorts of Christians O∣rientall
(that were come thither in Pilgrimage, and dwelt
at <HI>Ierusalem</HI>) convened together, which were about
the number of sixe thousand men, women, and children:
for being separated by the Patriarchs in two companies,
they compassed the Chappell of the Holy Grave nine
times; holding in their hands burning Candles, making
the beginning pittifull, and lamentable regreetings, but
in the ending, there were beating of Kettle-drums, soun∣ding
of Horn-trumpets, and other instruments, dancing,
leaping, and running about the Sepulchre, with an intol∣lerable
tumult, as if they had been all mad, or distracted
of their wits.</P>
<P>Thus is the prograce of their procession performed in
meere simplicitie, wanting civilitie, and government.
<PB N="270" REF="147"/>
But the <HI>Turkes</HI> have a care of that, for in the midst of all
this hurley burley, they runne amongst them with long
Rods, correcting their misbehaviour with cruell stroaks:
and so these slavish people, even at the height of their Ce∣remonious
devotion are strangely abused.</P>
<P>But our Procession begun before theirs, and with a grea∣ter
regard, because of our Tributes: The <HI>Turkes</HI> meane
while guarding us, not suffering the other Christians to
be participant in the singular dotage of the <HI>Romish</HI> folly,
being after this manner: First, the <HI>Guardian,</HI> and his <HI>Friers</HI>
brought forth of a <HI>Sacrastia,</HI> allotted for the same pur∣pose,
the wooden portracture of a dead Corps, represen∣ting
our <HI>Saviour,</HI> having the resemblance of five bloody
Wounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An abomina∣ble Idolatry.</NOTE> the whole body of which Image, was covered
with a Cambrick Vaile: Where having therewith thrice
compassed the Chappell of the <HI>Holy Grave,</HI> it was carried
to Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> and there they imbalmed the five
Timber holes; with Salt, Oile, Balme, and odoriferous
perfumes.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Guardian,</HI> and the other twelve <HI>Friers</HI> knee∣led
downe, and kissed each one of the five Suppositive
Wounds: the <HI>Turkes</HI> meane while laughing them to
scorne in their faces, with miserable derision. Thence
they returned, and laid the senslesse blocke upon the <HI>Holy
Grave,</HI> whence being dismissed the Papall Ceremony
ended.</P>
<P>Truly hereupon, may I say, if the <HI>Roman</HI> Jesuites,
<HI>Dominicans</HI> and <HI>Franciscans,</HI> there Resident in certain
speciall parts of the <HI>Turkes</HI> Dominions, had onely be∣haved
themselves as their politick charge required, and
dismissed from the Paganisme eyes, onely their idola∣trous
Images, veneration of Pictures, Crosses, and the
like externall superstitious Rites. These Infidels I say, had
<PB N="271" REF="147"/>
long ago (without any insight of Religion) beene con∣verted
to the Christian Faith. For besides all this blind∣nesse,
what infinite abominable Idolatries commit they
in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spaine;</HI> in clothing the Pictures of dead Ab∣bots,
Monks, Priors, Guardians, and the better kinde of
Officiall Friers and Priests, with Robes of Sattin, Velvet,
Damask, Taffaty, long gowns and coules of cloth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damnable &amp; intolerable superstition.</NOTE> shirts,
stockings, and shooes: And what a number of livelesse
pourtrayed Prioresses, motherlesse Nuns, yet infinite mo∣thers,
be erected (like the <HI>Maskerata</HI> of <HI>Morice-dancers</HI>)
in silver, gold, gilded brasse, iron, stone, tinne, lead, cop∣per,
clay, and timber shapes, adorned with double and
triple ornaments: over-wrought with silk, silver and gold∣laces,
rich bracelets, silk grograims, and Cambrick Vails,
chains, smocks, ruffs, cuffs, gloves, collers, stockings, gar∣ters,
pumps, nose-gayes, beads, and costly head-geire,
setting them on their Altars, O spectaculous Images!
adoring them for gods, in kneeling, praying, and say∣ing
Masses before them: Yet they are none of their a∣vowed,
allowed, and canonized pontificall Saints: for al∣though
they be bastards and wooden blocks, yet are they
better clad, then their lupish legitimate ones, no, I may
say, as the best Kings Daughter alive. Which is a sinfull,
odious, and damnable idolatry; and I freely confesse at
some times, and in some parts I have torne a pieces those
rich garments from their senslesse Images &amp; Blocks, thin∣king
it a greater sin not to do it, than to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and staring on
such prodigall prophannesse, with any superstitious re∣spect,
or with indifferent forberance to winke at the wic∣kednesse
of Idolaters.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Guardiano</HI> offered for ten pieces of gold (al∣though
my due be thirty Chickeens said hee) to make me
Knight of the holy Grave, or of the order of <HI>Ierusalem▪</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="148"/>
which I refused, knowing the condition of that dete∣stable
Oath I behoved to have sworne; but I saw two of
these other Pilgrimes receive that Order of Knight
hood.</P>
<P>The manner whereof is thus: First, they binde them∣selves
with a solemne vow, to pray (during life) for the
Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Knights of the Holy Grave.</NOTE> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> from
whom the Friers receive their maintenance; and also in∣speciall,
for the <HI>French</HI> King, by whose meanes they ob∣taine
their liberty of the Great <HI>Turke,</HI> to frequent these
monumentall places. Secondly, they are sworne enemies
to Protestants, and others, who will not acknowledge
the superiority of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. Thirdly, they
must pay yearly some stipend unto the Order of the
<HI>Franciscans.</HI> These attestations ended, the Frier putteth
a gilded Spurre on his right heel, causing the yong made
Knight stoop down on his knees, and lay his hands on the

Lo here the fashion of this Papisticall Knighthood,
which I forsook.</P>
<P>Indeed upon the Knighthood they have certain privi∣ledges
among the Papists, of which these are two: If a
Malefactour being condemned and brought to the Gal∣lows,
any of these Knights may straight cut the rope and
relieve him: The other is, they may carry and buy silks
through all <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> or else-where, and pay
no Custome, neither in comming nor going, nor for any

After our <HI>Guardiano</HI> had ended his superstitious Rites

re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned to the Monastery, having stayed three dayes
within that Church: And the next day thereafter, the
nine <HI>Ragusan</HI> and <HI>Venetian</HI> Factors left us, returning back
to their severall Stations.</P>
<P>About sixe of the clocke on monday morning, the <HI>Pa∣dre
Viccario,</HI> and the aforesaid <HI>Iohn Baptista</HI> accompa∣nying
us, wee travailed abroad in the hilly Countrey of
<HI>Iudea.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Monu∣ments.</NOTE> In this dayes journey, the places of any note wee
saw were these. First, where the Daughters of <HI>Ierusalem</HI>
came foorth to meete <HI>Saul,</HI> crying, <HI>Saul hath slaine his
thousand, and</HI> Dauid <HI>his ten thousand:</HI> And for memory
of this standeth a certaine olde pillar of Marble. Next
the valley of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rebin,</HI> where <HI>David</HI> slew the great <HI>Goliah.</HI>
And for remembrance of that, there are a great heape
of stones layd together in the bottome of the valley, like
to the Relickes of an old monument. Thirdly <HI>Bezura,</HI>
where <HI>Absalom</HI> killed his brother <HI>Ammon</HI> for <HI>Thamars</HI>
sake, whereof nothing but the name is onely reser∣ved.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Castle of <HI>Emaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</NOTE> now altogether ruinated
except only three firehouses of <HI>Moores;</HI> in which our Sa∣viour

of that house being vaulted, is turned over for a shelte∣rage
to sheepe, and a soft paved lodging for quivering
Goates.</P>
<P>Fiftly, the valley of <HI>Gibeon,</HI> where the ray-beaming
Sunne stood still at the voice of <HI>Ioshua,</HI> from his naturall
course. <HI>Ioshua</HI> 10. 12.</P>
<P>Sixtly, the Tombe or buriall place of <HI>Samuel,</HI>
that divine Prophet of the Lord: over the which the
<PB N="274" REF="149"/>
<HI>Moores</HI> have a <HI>Moskque</HI> erected, wherein we could not
enter, but hard by and without it, we found one of the
finest Fountaines in all <HI>Iudea,</HI> and yet not a dwelling
house neere unto it by three miles, in regard of the sas∣cinous
and infertile ground about it, the water whereof
was exceeding light, sweete and pleasant in digestion.
Seventhly, the Tombes of the valiant Captaine <HI>Iudas
Macchabeus,</HI> and his Children, whereupon are now
onely the ruines of an old Chappell, which is converted
in a hold for Sheepe and Goates: And last of all, the bu∣riall
place of the noble Family of the Kings and Queenes

within a short halfe mile. The entry whereto was so
straite, that on our backes we behoved to slide downe,
above ten paces under the ground with light candles in
our hands.</P>
<P>In that spacious place we saw twenty foure Chambers
hewen out of a Marble Rocke. Each roome hath a
hanging stone doore of a great thicknesse, so artificially
done by the skilfull Art of Masons, that the rarest spirit
of ten thousand cannot know how these doores have
beene made, so to moove as they do, being a firme Rocke
both below and above; and the doores have neither iron
nor timber-worke about them: but by cunning are made
so to turne, and in that same place where they grew they
are squared; yea and so exquisitely done that the most
curious Carpenter cannot ioyne a peece of boord so neat∣ly,
as these stone doores joyne with the Rock. In each of
these roomes are two Sepulchers, wherein I saw the bones
of some of these dead Princes.</P>
<P>Thursday, the tenth day of my being at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> not
reckoning the two dayes we spent in going to <HI>Iordan</HI>
the weeke, before: We I say, issued forth of the City
<PB N="275" REF="149"/>
early with our aforesaid Guides, riding Westward:
The first remarkable thing wee saw, was the place (as
they say) where the Crosse grew, whereon Christ suf∣fered:
being reserved by <HI>Greeks,</HI> who have a Convent
builded over it: That Crosse is said to have been of foure
sundry kinds of wood, and not of one Tree, for they
shewed vs but one hole where it grew, and so they hold
it to have been of one peece of Olive Tree, but this I
suspend, leaving it to be searched, by the pregnancy of
riper judgements then mine, howsoever opinio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forget a dissembling knavish <HI>Greeke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lying v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lany of a Ro∣gish <HI>Greek.</HI></NOTE>
who came here to <HI>London</HI> some eight yeares ago, to beg
support for the reparation of this decayed Monastery of
the holy Crosse. Well, <HI>Gundamore</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassa∣dour
intertained him; and recommended his cause to our
politique power: A contribution is granted, over all
<HI>England</HI> for the same purpose, and also recoiled, besides
the severall acknowledgements of our Noble Courtiers:
Opportunity come, I rancountred with this counter∣feit
Rascall in <HI>White Hall:</HI> Whereupon divers Gentle∣men
his Majesties servants, desired me to try him, if he had
beene at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> or dwelt at the Cloyster of the ho∣ly
Crosse: presently I demanded him, where the Convent
stood, hee replyed within <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and upon Mount
<HI>Moriah:</HI> which was false, for the Convent is remote from
the Citie, about three <HI>English</HI> miles: I posed him further
ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the situation of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> &amp;c. The quantity of this
Cloyster, of its Church, of the number of Friers, who li∣ved
in it, with many more questions, whose circumstances
would be redious: To any one of which, he could not re∣ply,
but stood shivering for feare and shame; neither had
he never been in <HI>Asia</HI> nor these parts: whereupon stealing
out of the Court, hee was no more seen abroad: for hee
<PB N="276" REF="150"/>
had got at Court, and in the Kingdome, above twelve
hundred pounds sterling, besides the advancement of
the Papists, and Recusants: and here was a tricke, that
then the <HI>Spanish</HI> faction put on us and themselves also
being deceived by a deceiver, deceived us with a double
deceit, policy, and lyes.</P>
<P>About five miles further, we arrived at a Village, on
the Mountaine of <HI>Iudea,</HI> where wee saw a disinhabited
house, in which <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the mother of Saint <HI>Iohn Bap∣tist</HI>
dwelt when <HI>Mary</HI> came up from <HI>Galilee</HI> to salute
her; and neare to this, we beheld (as they say) the Sanctu∣ary
wherein <HI>Zacharias</HI> was stricken dumbe till <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI>
was delivered: Two miles further, on a Rocky
Mountaine, wee arrived at a Cave,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saint Iohn</HI> the Baptists Cave.</NOTE> wherein (say they) S.
<HI>Iohn</HI> did his penance till he was nineteene yeares of age,
afterwhich time, he went downe and dwelt at <HI>Iordan:</HI>
It is a pretty fine place hewen out of a Rocke, to the
which we mounted by twelve steppes, having a window
our through a great thicknesse of firme stone whence wee
had the faire prospect of a fruitfull valley: and from the
mouth of this delectable <HI>Grotto,</HI> gusheth forth a most de∣licious
Fountaine.</P>
<P>Returning thence, we passed over an exceeding high
Mountaine, from whence wee saw the most part of <HI>Iudea</HI>
and to the Westward, in the way of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the Castle
of the Prophet <HI>Elisha,</HI> and <HI>Idumea</HI> the <HI>Edomits</HI> land ly∣ing
also between <HI>Aegypt▪</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> This cloudy
height, is called, the Mountaine of <HI>Iudea,</HI> because it over∣toppeth
all the rest of the Mountaines, that circumviron
<HI>Ierusalem, Palestine, Gallilee, Phenicia,</HI> or <HI>Samaria.</HI> De∣scending
on the South of the same Hill, wee arrived
at <HI>Phillips</HI> Fountaine, in which he baptized the Eunuch
of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> standing full in the way of <HI>Gaza.</HI> Here we
<PB N="277" REF="150"/>
paid some certaine <HI>Madi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> unto the <HI>Moores</HI> of the Vil∣lage,
for accosting the place, and drinking of the wa∣ter:
So did wee also for the sight of every speciall Monu∣ment
in <HI>Iudea.</HI></P>
<P>At night, wee lodged in <HI>Bethleem,</HI> in a Monastery of
the same <HI>Fransciscans</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> being onely sixe <HI>Fri∣ers:</HI>
After Supper we went all of us (having Candles) to
the place, where our Saviour was borne▪ over the which,
there is a magnificent Church builded: yea, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost
large and royall workemanship that for a Church is in all
<HI>Asia,</HI> or <HI>Affrick,</HI> being decored with an hundred and fifty
Pillars. But before wee came where the Crib had beene,
wee passed certain difficile wayes; where, being arrived,
wee entred in a gorgeous roome, adorned with <HI>Marble,
Saphyre,</HI> and <HI>Alabaster</HI> stones; and there they shewed
us both the place and the resemblance of the Crib:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Crib at <HI>Bethleem.</HI></NOTE> ouer
which were hanging lampes of pure Gold, and within
their circles oile continually burning. Not farre from
that place, and within the body of the admirable
Church, they shewed us the part, over the which, the
Starre stayed, that conducted the three Wise-men from
the East, who came out of <HI>Chaldea,</HI> to worship Christ,
and presented gifts unto him. From thence they brought
us to a Caue without the Townh, wherein (say they)
the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was hid, when <HI>Herod</HI> persecuted the
Babes life, (from which also being warned by the An∣gell)
Shee and <HI>Ioseph</HI> fled downe into <HI>Aegypt</HI> with the
Child.</P>
<P>In this time of her feare, say they, the milke left her
blessed breasts, so that the Babe was almost starved, but
Shee praying to the Almighty, there came forthwith a∣bundance,
which overflowing her breasts, and falling
to the ground, left ever since, as they alledge, this con∣sequent

vertue to this Cave.</P>
<P>The earth of the Cave is white as Snow, and hath this
miraculous operation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Admirable dust.</NOTE> that a little of it drunke in any
Liqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, to a Woman, that after her Child birth is bar∣ren
of Milke, shall forthwith give abundance: which
is not onely available to Christians, but likewise to
<HI>Turkish, Moorish,</HI> and <HI>Arabianish</HI> Women, who will
come from farre Countries, to fetch of this Earth. I
have seene the nature of this dust practised, wherefore
I may boldly affirme it, to have the force of a strange
vertue. Of the which Earth I brought with me a pound
weight, and presented the halfe of it to our sometimes
Gracious Queene <HI>Anne</HI> of blessed Memory, with di∣vers
other rare Relicts also, as a Girdle, and a paire of
Garters of the Holy Grave, all richly wrought in silke
and gold, having this inscription at every end of them in
golden Letters, <HI>Sancto Sepulchro,</HI> and the word <HI>Ieru∣salem,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> following, wee hired foure and twentie
<HI>Moores</HI> to conduct us unto <HI>Salomons</HI> Fish-ponds,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Solomons</HI> Fish ponds.</NOTE> which
are only three, being never a whit decayed; and to <HI>Fons
Segnatus,</HI> whence commeth the water in a stone Con∣duit,
along the Mountains, that serveth <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which
worke was done by <HI>Salomon.</HI> The ponds being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewen
out, and made square from the devalling face of a preci∣pitating
Mountaine; through which the stream of <HI>Fons
Signatus</HI> runneth, filling the ponds till it come to its own
<HI>aquadotte.</HI></P>
<P>Returning thence, and keeping our way Southward,
wee passed through the Valley of <HI>Hebron,</HI> where <HI>Iacob</HI>
dwelt, and entred into the fields of <HI>Sychem,</HI> where <HI>Ia∣cobs</HI>
Sons kept their Fathers Sheep; and not farre hence,
they shewed us a dry pit, which they called <HI>Iosephs</HI> pit,
<PB N="279" REF="151"/>
that was at <HI>Dothan;</HI> wherein hee was put by his Brethren
before they sold him to the <HI>Ismaelites.</HI></P>
<P>In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur backe comming to <HI>Bethleem,</HI> wee saw a Cave
in the Desart of <HI>Ziph</HI> wherein <HI>David</HI> hid himselfe, when
he ws persecuted by King <HI>Saul;</HI> and the field <HI>Adra,</HI> where
the Angels brought the glad tidings of salvation unto the
Sheepherds. Unto all which parts our <HI>Moorish</HI> guard
and <HI>Iohn Baptista,</HI> brought us and conducted us backe
againe to <HI>Bethleem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Town of <HI>Bethleem.</HI></NOTE> where wee stayed the second night.</P>
<P><HI>Bethleem</HI> is the pleasantest Village in all <HI>Iudea,</HI> situa∣ted
on a pretty Hill, and five <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Ierusa∣lem:</HI>
It produceth commodiously, an infinite number of
Olive and Figge-trees, some Cornes, and a kinde of white
wine, wherewith we were furnished all the time of our a∣bode
there; also in, and about <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> In our way, as we
came backe to the City, the next day following the <HI>Vic∣cario</HI>
shewed us a little <HI>Moskee,</HI> kept by <HI>Turkes,</HI> in which
(said he) was the Tombe of <HI>Rachell, Iacobus</HI> wife, who
died in that place; as shee was travelling from <HI>Padan-Aram,</HI>
with her husband <HI>Iacob.</HI></P>
<P>The ruines also of a house, where <HI>Habacuk</HI> the Prophet
dwelt; a <HI>Turpentine</HI> tree growing yet by the way side,
under the which (say they) th Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was wont
to repose her selfe in traveling. Wee saw also a naturall
rocke in the high way; whereon (say they) <HI>Elias</HI> oft
slept, and is not ashamed to say, that the hollow dimples
of the stone, was onely made by the impression of his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dy;
as though the tender flesh of man could leave the
print of his portracture on a hard stone. And not farre
from this, hee shewed us the place, where the Starre ap∣peared
to the wise men, after they had left <HI>Herod</HI> to seeke
for the Saviour of mankind.</P>
<P>Approaching Mount <HI>Syon,</HI> we saw a quadrangled, dry
<PB N="280" REF="152"/>
pond; wherein (say they) <HI>Beersheba</HI> the Wife of <HI>Vriah,</HI>
was Washing, when <HI>David</HI> looked forth from the toppe
of his Pallace, gazing on the aspect of his lust, gave the
Bridle of reason, fast tyed in the hands of temptation;
and becomming subject to the subtilty of sinne, was be∣witched
by her beauty; wherewith corruption trium∣phed
in Nature, and Godlinesse decreased in voluntary
consent; and from a royall Prophet fell in the bloudy lists
of Murther and Adultery.</P>
<P>Over against this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Davids</HI> Palace.</NOTE> on the North side of <HI>Gehin∣non</HI>
wee saw the ruines of a Palace wherein <HI>David</HI> dwelt,
which had beene one of the Angles of the ancient Cit∣ty;
and standeth at the division of the valley <HI>Ennon,</HI>
which compassed (as a Ditch) the North part of Mount
<HI>Syon,</HI> even to the Valley <HI>Iehosophat,</HI> and so Eastward,
being now filled up with fragments of old walles, and
the Valley of <HI>Gehinnon</HI> lying West, and East; borde∣ring
along the South side of <HI>Syon,</HI> till it ioyne also with
the narrow Valley of <HI>Iehosophat,</HI> which invironeth the
East, and devalling parts of <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Neere to this
demolished tower, we saw the habitation of <HI>Simeon,</HI> who
hauing seene the blessed <HI>Messias</HI> said: <HI>Now, Lord, let thy
Servant depart in peace, for mine eyes haue seene thy Salva∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>And now lastly upon the twelfth day of my abode
there, early on <HI>Thursday</HI> morning, the <HI>Guardiano,</HI> twelue
<HI>Friers,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Baptista</HI> (because that was the last day of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeing any more Monuments, or was to be seene there)
accompanied us: as wee issued at the South-gate of the
City, wee came to a place, on the skirt of <HI>Syon,</HI> where (say
they) <HI>Peter</HI> after his deniall of Christ his Master wept
bitterly.</P>
<P>Descending by the side of that same Hill, we crossed
<PB N="281" REF="152"/>
the Valley <HI>Gehinnon,</HI> and came to <HI>Acaldema</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acaldema.</NOTE> the Potters
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield, or field of blood; which is a little foure-squared
Roome, oppositive to the devaling side of the South-falling
<HI>Syon:</HI> three parts whereof are invironed with a
naturall Rocke, and the fourth square bordering with
the Valley, is made up of stone worke: The top is co∣vered,
and hath three holes, where through they let
the dead Christians fall downe, for it is a buriall place of
Pilgrimes to this day. As I looked downe, I beheld a
great number of dead corpes; some whereof had white
winding sheets, and newly dead, lying one aboue an o∣ther
in a lumpe; yeelding a pestilent smell, by reason
they were not covered with earth, saue onely the art¦chitecture
of a high vault, which maketh that in a long
time the corpes cannot putrifie and rot.</P>
<P>Neare unto this <HI>Campo,</HI> we entred into a dark Cave,
where (say they) the Apostles hid themselues, when
<HI>Christ</HI> was taken. At the foote of the same valley, wee
came to <HI>Ponto N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ponto N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemia.</NOTE> in which place the <HI>Iewes</HI> did
hide the Holy Fire, when they were taken captives to <HI>Ba∣bylon;</HI>
walking more downeward, toward the Valley
of <HI>Iehosophat,</HI> wee saw a darke Celler under the ground
without windowes; wherein (said the <HI>Guardian</HI>) the Id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣latrous
<HI>Iewes</HI> made a sacrifice of their children unto a bra∣zen
Image called <HI>Moloch,</HI> which being made hot they in∣closed
them in the hollownesse thereof; and so slue them:
and lest their crying should have moved any compassion
towards them, they made a thundring noise with Drums,
and other Instruments, whereupon the place was called
<HI>Tophet,</HI> mentioned in <HI>Ier.</HI> 7. 31. Hence wee came to the
<HI>Poole</HI> of <HI>Siloam,</HI> in which wee washed our selves, the
water whereof falleth down through a Rock, from
the City above, running straight to the Valley of <HI>Ieho∣sophat;</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="153"/>
and there we saw also the remnant of that sacked
Towre of <HI>Siloam.</HI> Neare to this wee saw a Fountaine,
where (say they) the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> used oft to wash the
Babes cloaths and linnen clouts. From thence wee cros∣sed
the Brooke <HI>Cedron</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brook <HI>Cedron.</HI></NOTE> (which guttereth through the
Valley of <HI>Iehosophat:</HI> and is always dry, unlesse it be in
<HI>December,</HI> when the rain falleth there impetuously for a
moneth together, which is all the Winter they have in
these parts: during which time none may labour, nor tra∣vell,
but forced to keepe themselves within Houses:
Having past, I say, this Brook we came to the Tombes of
<HI>Absolom</HI> and <HI>Zacharias,</HI> and the Cave wherein Saint
<HI>Iames</HI> was wont to hide himselfe from the persecuting
<HI>Iews.</HI> Ascending more upward on the Hill, in the way
of <HI>Bythinia,</HI> wee saw these places, where <HI>Iudas</HI> hanged
himselfe, over which there is a Vault erected, like a
halfe Moone, in memory of his selfe murther: and hard
by they shewed us where the withered Fig-tree grew, the
place being inclosed within a high stone Dike; and halfe
a mile thence wee came to the ruined house of <HI>Simon</HI> the
Leper.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Bythania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lazarus</HI> Tombe in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y∣thania.</HI></NOTE> we saw the Castle and Tombe of
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> on whom Christ shewed a Miracle, in raising
him from the Grave, after hee had been foure dayes dead.
It is a singular and rare Alablaster Tombe, and so exqui∣sitely
done, that it excelleth (<HI>Ierusalem</HI> excepted) all the
Monuments in <HI>Iudea,</HI> erected for the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke purpose,
being inclosed within a delicate Chappell under the
ground. Not farre thence in the same Village, wee saw
the decayed House where <HI>Martha,</HI> and <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>
inhabited, and the stone whereon Christ sate (say they)
when hee said to <HI>Martha,</HI> Mary <HI>hath chosen the best
part.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="153"/>
Leaving this moorish <HI>Bythania,</HI> being now a Village
of no qualitie, wee returned by beggerly <HI>Bethphage,</HI> and
finding it farre worser, about mid-day wee arrived on
the top of Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> where wee dined on our owne
provision carried with us, and then proceeded in our
sights.</P>
<P>From this place we had the full prospect of <HI>Ierusalem:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount <HI>Olive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and the places of note there∣of.</NOTE>
For the City standing upon the edge of a Hill, cannot be
seen all at one sight; save on this Mountain, which is two
times higher then Mount <HI>Syon.</HI> These are the Monuments
shewn us upon the Mount of <HI>Olives:</HI> First, the print of
the left foot of our Saviour, in an immoveable stone,
which he made when hee ascended to Heaven; the <HI>Guar∣diano</HI>
told us further, that the right foots print was taken
away by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and detained by them in the Temple
of <HI>Salomon:</HI> But who can think our Saviour trod so hard
at his Ascension, as to have left the impression of his feet
behind him.</P>
<P>Next the place where hee foretold the judgement to
come, and the signes, and the wonders, that should be
seene in the Heavens before that dreadfull day. Thirdly,
the place where the <HI>Symbolum Apostolorum</HI> was made,
which is a fine Chamber under ground, like a Church,
having twelve pillars to support it. Fourthly, where
Christ taught his Disciples the <HI>Pater noster,</HI> and where
hee fell in an Agony, when hee sweat blood and water.
Fifthly, where <HI>Peter, Iames,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> slept, whiles our
Saviour prayed, and returned so oft to awake them; and
also below that, where the other Disciples were left. Sixt∣ly,
the Garden of <HI>Gethsemaine,</HI> where Christ used com∣monly
to pray; in the which place he was apprehended
by the Officers of the high Priests, and it was also where
<HI>Iudas</HI> kissed him, and the Serjants fell backward on the
<PB N="284" REF="154"/>
ground. Seventhly, they shewed us a stone marked with
the Head, Feet, and Elbows of <HI>Iesus,</HI> in their throwing of
him down, when as they bound him, after he was taken,
and ever since (say they) have these prints remayned
there.</P>
<P>And lastly, at the foot of Mount <HI>Olivet,</HI> in the Valley
of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> we descended by a paire of staires of forty
three steps, and six paces large, in a faire Church builded
under the ground: Where (say they) the Monument of
the Assumption of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is, and did shew
it unto us, whom (they think was born in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> dwelt
at <HI>Bethleem,</HI> and <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and died upon Mount <HI>Syon.</HI> I
saw also there, the Sepulchres of <HI>Ioseph</HI> her Husband,
<HI>Ioachim</HI> her Father, and of <HI>Anna</HI> her Mother. And for
which sights paying sixteene <HI>Madins</HI> a man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacred and singular Tombes.</NOTE> to certaine

us, having seen all the Antiquities and places of note,
were to be seen, in, and about all <HI>Iudea.</HI></P>
<P>Lo, I have plainly described all these Monuments, by
the order of these twelve severall days: The like hereto∣fore,
was never by any Travailer so punctually, and so tru∣ly,
and so curiously set down, and made manifest to the
intellective Reader. But as I said in the beginning of my
Description, so say I now at the conclusion, some of these
things are ridiculous, some of manifest untruths, some al∣so
doubtfull, and others, somewhat more credible, and of
apparant truth. The recapitulation whereof, is only by
me used, as I was informed, by <HI>Gaudentius Saybantus</HI> the
father <HI>Guardian, Laurenzo Antonio il Viccario,</HI> and the
Trenchman <HI>Iohn Baptista.</HI></P>
<P>Now in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> we the eleven <HI>Franks</HI> stayed three
dayes longer, preparing our selves for a new Voyage to
go down to <HI>Aegypt</HI> with a Caravan of <HI>Grand Cayro:</HI> In
<PB N="285" REF="154"/>
which time the aforesaid <HI>Frier Laurenzo,</HI> whose life I had
saved on the <HI>Quarantanam,</HI> propined mee privatly with
twelve Crosses made of the Olive Wood of Mount <HI>Oli∣vet:</HI>
Each Crosse having 24 Relicks indented in them,
with forty pair of Chaplets made of that same Wood, two
<HI>Turkish</HI> Handkerchiefs, and three paire of Garters and
Girdles of the <HI>Holy Grave:</HI> All wrought in silke and

there came a fellow to us, on

Which when the <HI>Guardian</HI> understood, what I had done
in memory of my Prince upon that Sacred Tombe, he was
greatly offended with me, that I should have polluted that
holy place, with the name of such an Arch-enemy to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church. But not knowing how to mend himself,
and hearing mee to recite of the Heroicke Vertues of our
matchlesse <HI>Monarch:</HI> who for Bounty, Wisdom, and Lear∣ning,
was not paragonized among all the Princes of the
earth: His fury fell; and begun to intreat me, to make it
known to his Majesty, that he never allowed any support
to their afflicted lives, neither any gratuity for maintayning
of these Sacred Monuments at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> his subjects being
as free here as they. Which indeed I performed, for after
my arrivall in <HI>England,</HI> and having propined his Majesty
with divers rare things, and a <HI>Turpentine rod</HI> from <HI>Iordan;</HI>
in the midst of my Discourses, I told his Highnesse, in the

indeed gave me a most gracious answer, saying, <HI>They never
sought any help of him, and if they had, he would have suppor∣ted

and being re-incloy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tred again, after breakfast, the

I recall, although the principall, be lost in the Inquisi∣tion

<P>Then had we avaricious <HI>Baptista</HI> our Guide and Inter∣preter
to reward every one of us propining him with two
Chickeens of Gold: And lastly, wee gratified the gaping
Steward, the <HI>Cerberian</HI> Porter, the <HI>Cymerian</HI> Cooke,

from each of us: amounting in all among the four <HI>Catz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cullioni,</HI>

<P>Nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greedy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>attering Friers.</NOTE> this was not all; for even when the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Ca∣ravan,
was staying for us without the City, the <HI>Guar∣dian</HI>
made a begging Sermon to us, imploring our boun∣ties
to commiserate and support their great calamities,
losses and oppressions inflicted upon them by the Infidels,
with many other base and flattering speeches: which in∣deed
nine of us refused, because of the great Extortion
hee had imposed upon us before; but the two <HI>Germa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

<P>And now finally, ere I leave Mount <HI>Syon,</HI> I think it

go where they will, but are freely maintained every

<P>Having bid farwell to <HI>Syon,</HI> we marched that afternoon
in the way of <HI>Gaza;</HI> and arrived at night in a goodly Vil∣lage,
more full of <HI>Iews</HI> than <HI>Moores,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kind <HI>Iews</HI> to us <HI>Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks.</HI></NOTE> called <HI>Hembaluda,</HI> si∣tuate
on the face of a fruitfull Hill, and the last limit of
<HI>Iudea:</HI> Here the <HI>Germans</HI> and I were well entertained <HI>gra∣tis,</HI>
by certain <HI>Iews</HI> that spoke <HI>Italian,</HI> and much rejoyced
to see such strangers in these bounds, for two of them had
been borne in <HI>Venice:</HI> The Captaine, and our company
were all <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> all of them being Christians, called
<HI>Copties, viz.</HI> believers: Their number was about 800 per∣sons,
who had come up from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to dignifie for devo∣tions
sake this <HI>Easter</HI> time, being the greatest feast of <HI>Ie∣rusalem;</HI>
of whom by the way we received great affability
and kinde respect without any offence.</P>
<P>That night the whole Caravan lay in the fields, and we
stayed within the Town making merry with our <HI>Hebraick</HI>
friends, early the next morning we imbraced our <HI>Idumean</HI>
way, finding this <HI>Edomitish</HI> land sorely dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressed by the
<PB N="291" REF="157"/>
<HI>Arabs,</HI> and yet the inhabitants were subject to the <HI>Turke:</HI>
In this long days journey wee found abundance of water,
and all other necessaries for our reliefe, and yet the people
were both rude and extream barbarous, having no more
shew of humanity then the foure-footed Leopards of
<HI>Berdoa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentlemen grew affraid at these Savages, as
being unacquainted before with such an awful fight; &amp; to
dispel their fear, tush, said I, courage Gentlemen, no scope,
no hope, and flash'd out these lines in <HI>Italian</HI> to them.</P>
<Q><L>To gallant minds, all kinde of soils they be,</L>
<L>Their native land; as fish imbrace the Sea:</L>
<L>For they who would traverse earths variant face,</L>
<L>Must take their hazard, as they finde the place;</L>
<L>And that's my soile; best means can me defray,</L>
<L>But Sirs be glad, we came not here to stay.</L></Q>
<P>Againe night wee declined towards <HI>Gaz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient City of <HI>Gaza.</HI></NOTE> and there
stayed in a fine Cane prepared for Travellers; where the
whole Caravan, Souldiers, Camels, Dromidores, Mules,
and Asses were all well satisfied and refreshed: The next
morning we went to the <HI>Bezestan,</HI> or Market place, and
there furnished our selves with provision of Bread, Hens,
Egs, Garlick, and Onions, sufficient enough to carry us
through the Desarts being ten days journey. <HI>Gaza</HI> now is
called <HI>Habalello,</HI> and is composed of 1200 fire-houses, and
fensible against the incursions of <HI>Arabs:</HI> The chiefe Citi∣zens,
being <HI>Turks, Moors, Iews,</HI> domestick <HI>Arabians,</HI> with
a few <HI>Georgians,</HI> and <HI>Nostranes.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Garrison here of Souldiers, and a <HI>Turkish</HI>
Captaine, that commandeth the Towne and Castle: In
the afternoone, wee set our faces forward to that feare∣full
<PB N="292" REF="158"/>
Wildernesse, and traviled ore night twelve miles,
pitching our Tents beside a source or standing Well.
Here our Guard kept a strict Watch about us all night;
and I kept as well the <HI>Germanes</HI> from langour, cherishing
them with joviall merriments, for they were my inward
friends yet of a faint and fearefull nature. At the breake
of day wee set forward, passing through diverse Rockey
and shrubby heights, till afternoone, and then wee de∣clined
to a sandy Valley: Where when come, what with
the deepnesse of the Way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burning Sands.</NOTE> and the great heate reflexing
upon the Sand, and from the Sand to our faces, wee were
miserable turmoiled and scorched, especially I, who went
alwayes on foot.</P>
<P>Having past this wearisome bottome, and before night
marching along the skirt of a craggy Hill, two hundred
<HI>Arabs</HI> broake out upon us from holes and bushes, and
shrewdly annoyed our Company with Arrowes, till a
contribution of sixt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene Piasters was sent to them. The
halfe of that night wee pitched our Tents, in a pastorable
plaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild <HI>Arabs</HI> selling water.</NOTE> where some scatering <HI>Arabs,</HI> sold us Water in
Wooden Cups, carrying it in Wild Boars skins upon
their naked backes. Two of which Savages our Cap∣taine
hired, to guide us the next day to the first Castle of
the three, that were built by the <HI>Turkes,</HI> and a dayes jour∣ney
distant one from another; being each of them strong∣ly
guarded with Souldiers, and that for the relief of Cara∣vans,
being the most dangerous, and most desolate place in
the Desarts.</P>
<P>Our Guides the day following, brought us through
the best and safest places of the Countrey, where we found
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertaine profitable parts, planted with haire-cloath tents,
and ouer-clad heere and there with spots of Sheepe and
Goates: and yet were wee not there without the invasion
<PB N="293" REF="158"/>
of stragling <HI>Arabs,</HI> and paying of tributes, which the
Captaine defrayed for us, our condition being formerly
made so at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Before night with great heate, and
greater drouth, wee approached to the first Castle, where
the Captaine thereof received us kindly, causing our
Tents to be pitched round about the quadrangled Tower.
Here we had abundance of water (though I would rather
have had Wine) to suffice the whole Company, drawne
out of a Cisterne, and reposing safely upon the hard
ground, the Castle Garrison watched us, and our guard
watched them.</P>
<P>Thence with a new Guide the sequell morne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rievous and desert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous travelling.</NOTE> we mar∣ched
through a fiery faced plaine scorch'd with burning
heate, and deepe rolling Sand, where diverse of our
smallest Beasts perished, with sixe men and Women also
in relieving their ouerwhelmed Asses. Long ere midday,
having got to a hard-heigth, we pitched our tents, re∣posing
under their shadowes till the evening, for wee
were not able to indure the intollerable heate of the Sun;
and so did wee likewise over-shadow our selves every
mid-day. The vigour of the day gone, and the cooling
night come, we advanced forward to the middle Castle,
being led by our guide, and the pale Lady of the night
leading him: Where when come, wee found neither
that Fort answerable to the former in strength, nor the
Captaine so humane as the other was here: wee were all
offended with the scarcity of Water, the Captaine
playing the Villaine, crossed us because the Caravanship
were Christians: at last about midnight some 30 <HI>Arabs,</HI>
came to us loaden with Water, carried on their backes.
To whom wee payed for every <HI>Caraff,</HI> being an <HI>English</HI>
quart, three <HI>Aspers</HI> of silver, ten <HI>Aspers</HI> going to a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ling:
Whereof my kinde <HI>Dutch-men</HI> drunke too much,
<PB N="294" REF="159"/>
the Water being thick and of a brownish colour; and hot
like pisse, offended their over-wained stomackes; which
as I supposed, was the chiefest cause the next day of some
of their Deaths.</P>
<P>After mid-night, the <HI>Turkish</HI> Captaine, and our Cara∣van
fell at variance about Water for our Beasts, who were
ready to choake, and if they had not bin prevented with
Souldiers on both sides, it had drawne us and them, to a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inall mischiefe. The discord vnpacified, before the follow∣ing
day, and within night, we imbraced our wilsome and
fastidious way, journying through many dens &amp; umbra∣gious
caves, over-shaded with mouldring heights; in some
whereof we found Savage Women lying in their Barba∣rous
child-bed: having their bodies naked (the fore-face
of their Wombe excepted) their beds were made of soft
Sand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Savage wo∣men having their Child∣bed in Caves.</NOTE> and ouerspred with leaves a foote thick; whose new
borne babes lying in their armes, were swadled with
the same Leaves. And for all their sicknesse, which was ve∣ry
small, they had none of our wives sugered sops, burnt
wines, Venison pasties, delicate fare, and great feasting, nor
a months lying in, and then Churched, putting their hus∣bands
to in comparible charges. No, no, their food is one∣ly
Bread, Garlick, Hearbs, and Water, and on the third or
fourth day instead of Churching, they go with Bows and
Arrows to the fields againe, hunting for spoils and boo∣ties
from passing Caravans.</P>
<P>Advancing in our course, wee fell down from the hils
in a long bottome of sand, above sixe miles in length:
Wherein with sore wrestling against the parching Sun,
and could get no ground to pitch our tents to over-shade
us, three of our <HI>Germans,</HI> the two Barons, Signior <HI>Strouse,</HI>
and Signior <HI>Crushen,</HI> with one Signior <HI>Thomasio,</HI> tumbled
downe from their beasts backes starke dead, being suffo∣cated
<PB N="295" REF="159"/>
with the vigorous Sunne, for it was in <HI>May,</HI> choa∣ked
also with extream drowth, and the reflection of the
burning sand; and besides their faire was growne mise∣rable,
and their water worse, for they had never been
acquainted with the like distresse before, though it was
always my <HI>vade Mecum.</HI> Whereupon the Caravan s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ai∣ed

Hill, wee digged a hollow pit, and disroabing them of
their <HI>Turkish</HI> cloathes, I did with my owne hands cast
them all three one above an other, in that same hole, and
covering the Corpes with moulding earth; the Souldiers
helped mee to role heavy stones about their grave, to
the end that the bloody <HI>Iackals</HI> should not devour their
corpes; and to conclude this wofull and sorrowfull ac∣cident,
the other <HI>Germans</HI> alive, bestowed on mee their
dead friends <HI>Turkish</HI> garments, because of my love and di∣ligent
care I ever did shew them; which one of their
empty Mules carried for me to <HI>Grand Cayro.</HI></P>
<P>Whence with divers assaults,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Castle of the Desarts.</NOTE> and greater paines ac∣coasting
the third Castle, with as great bewailing the
losse of our friends, as wee had contentment in our owne
safety, wee found this third Captaine both humane and
hospitable: Who indeed himselfe in person with his
Garrison, watched us all night, and had a speciall care
in providing Water for us all, propining our Captaine
and us eight <HI>Franks</HI> before supper, with three roasted
Hens and two Capons: This <HI>Turkish</HI> Captaine told us
there were three inhabited Townes in these Desarts, the
chiefest whereof was <HI>Sehan,</HI> situate on the Red Sea, ha∣ving
a harbor and shipping, that trade both to <HI>Aegypt</HI> and
<HI>Aethiopia,</HI> whose commodities are silken stuffs and Spices
<PB N="296" REF="160"/>
which they transport from <HI>Mecha,</HI> and carry to <HI>Melinda,</HI>
and the aforesaid places in <HI>Affricke:</HI> But now lest I sink in

<P>This <HI>Arabia deserta,</HI> is the place where the people of
<HI>Israel</HI> wandred forty yeares long, being fed with <HI>Man∣na</HI>
from Heaven, and with water out of the driest rockes.
In which is Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> where the Law of the two Ta∣bles
was promulgated. The most part of these Desarts
is neither fit for herbage nor tillage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The scurrile <HI>Arabian</HI> De∣sarts.</NOTE> being covered o∣ver
with a dry, and thick Sand, which the wind trans∣porteth
whither it listeth, in heates and mountaines, that
often intercept and indanger fatigated Travellers. The
Inhabitants here are few, so are their Cities, their dwel∣lings
being sequestrate dennes and haire cloath Tents:
The most of their wealth consisteth in Camels, Dromido∣ries,
and Goats.</P>
<P>Before our arrivall in <HI>Saleack,</HI> wee passed the little <HI>Ist∣mus</HI>
of ground which parteth <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Affrica,</HI> disioy∣ning
the <HI>Mediterranian</HI> and the red Seas: Divers have
attempted to digge through this strait to make both Seas
meete for a nearer passage to <HI>India,</HI> of whom <HI>Sesostris</HI>
King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> was the first: Secondly, <HI>Darius</HI> the great
<HI>Persian</HI> Monarch: Thirdly another <HI>Aegyptian</HI> King, who
drew a ditch 100 foote bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and thirty and odde miles
long. But when he intended to finish it, he was forced to
cease, for feare of overflowing all the lower land, the red
Sea being found to be higher by three cubits than the or∣dinary
plaine of <HI>Aegypt:</HI> Yet howsoever it was, the ditch
is hollow in divers parts, and fastidious, because of sand
to passe over.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="161"/>
At <HI>Saleack</HI> we overtook a great Caravan of two thou∣sand
people, &amp; twelve hundred Camels and Dromidores,
which were loaden with the ware of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> and came
from <HI>Damascus,</HI> intending their Voyage for <HI>Cayro,</HI> whose
company we subtilly left, and marched before them, for
receiving of water by the way for our selves and beasts out
of Cisterns, which we left dry behind us.</P>
<P>A Dromidore and Camell differ much in quality, but
not in quantity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of Camels &amp; Dromidores.</NOTE> being of one height, bredth, and length;
save only their heads and feet, which are proportionated
alike; and the difference is such that the Dromidory hath
a quick and hard-reaching trot, and will ride above 80
miles in the day, if that his Rider can indure the pain. But
the Camell is of a contrary disposition: For hee hath a
most slow and lazie pace, removing the one foot from
the other, as though hee were weighing his feet in a bal∣lance;
neither can he goe faster although hee would: But
hee is a great deale more tractable then the other: For
when his Master loadeth him, hee falleth downe on his
knees to the ground, and then riseth againe with his bur∣then,
which will be marvellous great, sometimes 600 or
800 weight.</P>
<P>The Red Sea, which we left to the Westward of us, and
our left hand, is not red as many suppose, but is the very
colour of other Seas: The reason for which it hath beene
called <HI>Mare rubrum,</HI> is only because of the banks, rushes,
sands and reeds that grow by the shore side, which are na∣turally
red. Some others have called it so, in respect of the
Brooks which <HI>Moses</HI> turned to red blood, who miscon∣struing
the true sense, took Seas for Rivers.</P>
<P>It is vulgarly termed <HI>Sinus Arabicus,</HI> whose length is
1600 miles. This Sea is famous for the miraculous pas∣sage
of the <HI>Israelites</HI> through it, and the drowning of
<PB N="299" REF="161"/>
<HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his people: and because of Spices that were
brought from <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> from
whence the <HI>Venetians</HI> dispersed the same through all <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
and the <HI>Mediterran</HI> Coasts of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Affricke:</HI>
But this Navigation is now discontinued by the <HI>Portu∣gals,
English</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> which bring such Wares to
their severall homes by the back side of <HI>Affricke:</HI> So that
the Trafficke of <HI>Alexandria</HI> is almost decayed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indian</HI> Spices much weak∣ned.</NOTE> and the
Riches of the <HI>Venetians</HI> much diminished; so is the ver∣tue
of the Spices much impaired by too much moy∣sture
contracted, with the long and tedious carriage
thereof.</P>
<P>This aforesaid <HI>Saleack,</HI> is thought to be seated on the
lower and Eastmost end of <HI>Gozan,</HI> consisting of eight
hundred dwelling Houses, being walled and fencible a∣gainst
the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and defended also with a Castle, and ten
troups of Horsmen being <HI>Ianizaries.</HI> Here we rested and
refreshed our selves two nights, providing us fresh victu∣als
for <HI>Grand Cayro,</HI> being foure days journey distant; and
at our leaving of <HI>Saleack,</HI> I saluted this new seen Coun∣trey,

who left mee all his owne gold, and what the

that he left mee absolute heire, to intromet with all and
whatsoever they had there: But eftsoons the treache∣rous
Consul knowing that I was a stranger to them, and
by accident met together at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and that they were
Gentlemen, and well provided with gold, forg'd a reason
to himselfe, and for his owne benefit, that hee would
meddle with all they left behind them, under this excuse,
that he would be answerable to their friends for it, at his

with great difficulty bought one grave for them all three

I sup'd, and reposed till the morrow, thanking God of
my good fortune: Yet was I exceeding sorrowfull for the
losse of these gallant Gentlemen, Religiously disposed,
and so affable, that for familiarity and kindnesse they were
the mirrours of noble minds, and vertuous spectacles of
humanity; whose Deaths were to mee a Hell, and whose
lives had beene my Paradice on earth. To whose memo∣ry
and prayse, I am not able to Congratulate the least
Commendation, their Heroicke dispositions, deserved at
my hands.</P>
<P>But what shall I say, their time was come, which mor∣tality
might sorrow, but sorrow might not prevent
Death, whose power is deafe to all humane lamentati∣ons.
Neither will I relye so much upon my owne wor∣thinesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods provi∣dent mercies.</NOTE>
as to thinke the benefit of the procrastination
of my Life, was by any merite of mine deserved, but
that God so much the more, might show his incompre∣hensible
goodnesse in delivering me, from the violence
of such unexpected accidents, and to tye my soule to bee
thankfull for his mercies. For all the beginnings of man
are derived from God, whose ends are either perfited or
disanulled by his determination; and nothing wee pos∣sesse
is properly our owne, or gotten by our own power,
but given us onely through his goodnesse and munifi∣cence.</P>
<P>And all the spaces of earth which our feet tread over,
the Light we enioy, and the excellent faculties we are

raised, guided, and distributed, by Gods impenetrable
Counsell, Will, and Providence: which although the
pride of our wicked nature doth not yeeld the true attri∣bution

<P>This incorporate World of Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> is the most
admirable and greatest City, seen upon the earth, being
thrice as large of bounds as <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and likewise
so populous, but not so well builded, being situate in a
pleasant Plain, and in the heart of <HI>Egypt,</HI> kissing <HI>Nylus</HI> at
some parts.</P>
<P>The City is divided in five Townes, first and formost,
<HI>Cairo novo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Ci¦ty of <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Cayre.</HI></NOTE> the new <HI>Caire,</HI> which is the principall and
chiefest place of all the other, lying in midst of the rest,
having Walls and Ports, the circuit whereof is twenty
two miles, containing all the chiefe Merchandise and
Market places within it.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Cairo Vecchio,</HI> the old <HI>Caire,</HI> called for∣merly
<HI>Cairo de Babylonia,</HI> or <HI>Babylon Aegyptiorum:</HI> for
there were two <HI>Babylons,</HI> one in <HI>Assyria</HI> called now by
the <HI>Turkes Bagdat,</HI> and the other is this that joyneth
with the new <HI>Caire:</HI> It was also anciently called <HI>Mem∣phis,</HI>
and was the furthest place <HI>Vlysses</HI> in his Travels vi∣sited,
so well memorized by <HI>Homer:</HI> yet a Voyage of
no such estimation as that Princely Poet accounted it;
for his Travels were not answerable to the fifteenth part
of mine:</P>
<P>The third Towne is <HI>Medin,</HI> joyning to the back∣side
of the old <HI>Caire,</HI> toward the <HI>Piramides:</HI> The fourth
is <HI>Boulake,</HI> running a great length down along and neer
the River side, having three Market places of no small
account: The fift and last, is the great Town of <HI>Caraf∣far,</HI>
bending Southward, in the way of the Red Sea for
many miles: All which are but as Suburbs to the new
<HI>Caire,</HI> that of many smalls make up a Countrey, ra∣ther
then a City: And yet all of them are contiguate
<PB N="306" REF="165"/>
one with an other, either to the left or right hand, or
to them both, with innumerable streets: The length
whereof in all, from the lowest end of <HI>Boulak,</HI> to the
South-most part of <HI>Caraffar</HI> is by my deepe experience
twenty eight <HI>English</HI> miles, and fourteene in breadth;
for tryall whereof I tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad it one day on foote from Sun

which for my bruised feet on the streets, was
one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orest dayes iourney that ever I had in my
life.</P>
<P>The principall gates of the new <HI>Caire</HI> are <HI>Babeh Mam∣stek,</HI>
looking toward the Wildernesse and the Red Sea:
<HI>Bebzauillah</HI> toward <HI>Nylus,</HI> and <HI>Babell Eutuch</HI> toward
the fields: The streetes are narrow, beeing all of them al∣most
covered to save them from the parching heate with
open vents for light; and their buildings commonly are
two stories high, composed either of mudde or brick,
and platforme on the tops; whereon usuall in the night
they use to sleep to imbrace the fresh and cooling ayre.
Their <HI>Bazar</HI> or exchange beginneth at the gate of <HI>Mam∣steck,</HI>
and endeth at a place called <HI>Babeso.</HI></P>
<P>At the corners of chiefe streetes and market places, there
are divers horses standing ready sadled and bridled,
that for a small matter, or according to the way, a man
may hire and ride where so he will, either to negotiate,
or to view this spacious spred City, and change as ma∣ny
horses as hee listeth, having the Masters which owne
them to convey them for lesse or longer way, which is a
great ease to weary passengers.</P>
<P>There is a great commerce here with exceeding ma∣ny
nations; for by their concurring hither, it is won∣derfull
peopled with infinite numbers: for the Coun∣trey
aboundeth in Silkes, Cornes, Fruits, Waxe, Ho∣ney,

and the soveraigne <HI>Balsamo</HI> good for all sores, be∣sides
many other Commodities of Cotten-wooll, rich
Stuffs of cloth of gold and silver, and the best Sattins,
Damask, Taffaties, and Grograims that are made in the
World are here.</P>
<P>The infinite populositie of which place, and the ex∣treame
heat, is the cause why the pest is evermore in
the City: in so much, that at some certaine times, ten
thousand persons have died in one day: Nay, the Citie
is reputed to be in good health, if there die but one, or
two thousand in a day, or three hundred thousand in a
whole yeare, I mean, when the sore encroaching pe∣stilence,

their under lips; hanging rich pearles and precious stones
to them; wearing also about their armes faire Bracelets,
and about their ancles below, broad bonds of gold or
silver. To which if the baser sort cannot attaine unto,
then they counterfeit their Betters with Rings, Bracelets,
and bonds of Brasse, Copper, Lead, and white Iron, and
thinke themselves not worthy to live unlesse they weare
these badges.</P>
<P>They also use here as commonly they doe through all
<HI>Turkey,</HI> the Women to pisse standing, and the men to
coure low on their knees, doing the like. They weare
here linnen breeches and leather Bootes as the men doe,
and if it were not for their covered faces, and longer
gowns, wee would hardly know the one from the o∣ther.
As for the Religion of the <HI>Copties</HI> or <HI>Egyptian</HI>
Christians, they are Circumcised, after the <HI>Iudaicall</HI>
manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Egytian</HI> Christians.</NOTE> but not after the eight day, but the eight yeare.
And it is thought, they follow the Religion of <HI>Eutyches,</HI>
holding but one nature in Christ: which was defended
by <HI>Dioscorus</HI> and the Counsell of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> in regard of
<HI>Eutyches.</HI> But the <HI>Copties</HI> themselves say, they have
their Religion from <HI>Prester Iehan,</HI> and so it is most
manifest, being no difference betweene the one and the
other.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="166"/>
They make frequently at all meetings the signe of the
Crosse to other, thwarting their two foremost fingers, lay
them on their brow, and then on their breasts, &amp; kissing
them, the salutation is done.</P>
<P>They will not suffer any Images,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Religion.</NOTE> nor Pictures to bee in
their Churches, and yet they have an Altar, and a kinde of

Dead, &amp;c. Neverthelesse auricular Confession is com∣monly

the land being so plentifull, and their nature libi∣dinous,
it increaseth both their insolence, and inordinate
affections. Neither doe they live long, in regard of the
great heat they indure. <HI>Aegypt</HI> being placed betweene
the two Tropickes, under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> bringeth to
passe, that seldome will any there attaine to threescore
yeares of age.</P>
<P>In all this Land of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which is a great Kingdome,
there is no running Well or Fountaine, save onely the
River <HI>Nylus:</HI> Neither doe the Inhabitants scarcely know
what Raine is, because they seldome see any, and if by
rare accident, a Cloud happen to dissolve upon them, it
bringeth to their bodies innumerable soares and diseases.
And yet for aboundance of Cornes, and all kind of fruites
the Earth yeeldeth, there is no Country can brag with
<PB N="310" REF="167"/>
<HI>Aegypt;</HI> whereupon it was called in the time of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
as well as <HI>Sycilia, Horreum populi Romani.</HI> And
notwithstanding this Kingdome produceth no Wines,
neyther is garnished with Vineyards, but that which
strangers make use of, are brought from <HI>Candy, Cyprus,</HI> &amp;
<HI>Greece.</HI> The defect being thus, these <HI>Mahometanicall
Moores</HI> observing strictly the Law of their <HI>Alcor an,</HI> will
neither plant wines, nor suffer any to be planted, accoun∣ting
it a deadly sin to drink wine; but for <HI>Coffa,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sherpet,</HI>
composed Liquors, they drinke enough of.</P>
<P>As for their <HI>Balsamo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Garden of <HI>Balsamo.</HI></NOTE> the Garden wherein it grow∣eth,
lyeth neere to the South-side of <HI>Cayre,</HI> and inclosed
with a high Wall, being sixe miles in compasse, and
daily guarded by <HI>Turkes.</HI> To which when I came, being
Conducted with a <HI>Ianizary,</HI> they would not suffer mee
to enter, neither any Christian, &amp; far lesse the <HI>Iewes:</HI> For
not long ago, they were the cause, that almost this Balme
was brought to confusion, they having the custome of it
for certaine yeares.</P>
<P>The Tree it selfe is but of three foote height, which
keepeth evermore the colour greene, having a broad
three poynted leafe, which being thrice in the yeare in∣cised
in the body and branches; it yieldeth a red Water
that droppeth in earthen Vessels, which is the naturall
<HI>Balsomo.</HI></P>
<P>And not far from this Garden, in a sandy Desart, is
the place called <HI>Mommeis,</HI> which are innumerable
Caves cut foorth of a Rocke, where unto the Corpes of
the most men in <HI>Cayro,</HI> are carried and interred. Which
dead bodies remayne always, unpurified; neither yield
they a stinkingsmell: Whereof experiments are plentifull
at this day by the whole Bodies, Hands, or other parts,
which by Merchants are now brought from thence, and
<PB N="311" REF="167"/>
doth make the <HI>Mummia</HI> which <HI>Apothecaries</HI> use: The
colour being very blacke, and the flesh clung unto the
bones.</P>
<P>Now having viewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pyramide of <HI>Aegypt.</HI></NOTE> and review'd this <HI>Microcosmus</HI> of
the greater world, the foure <HI>French</HI> Pilgrimes and I,
did hire a <HI>Ianizarie</HI> to conduct us to the great Pyramides,
surnamed the Worlds wonders; which are distant from
<HI>Cayre</HI> about foure Leagues, standing beside or neere to
to the banks of <HI>Nylus:</HI> Where, when come, I beheld their
proportion to bee Quadrangled, growing smaller and
smaller to the top, and builded with huge and large
stones, the most part whereof, are five foote broad, or
there abouts, and nine foot in length, being of pure
Marble.</P>
<P>All the Historians that ever wrot of these Wonders,
have not so amply Recived their admirable greatnesse,
as the experience of the beholder, may testifie their ex∣cessive
greatnesse and height. The first and East-most
we approached unto, is highest, and by our <HI>Dragomans</HI>
skilfull Report, amounted to eleven hundred and twenty
sixe foote. The Basis, or bottome whereof, being twelve
hundred paces in Circuite, allowing every square of the
foure faces three hundred paces, and every pace two
foote and a halfe. Every Pyramide having outwardly
to ascend upon (though now for the most part demolish∣ed)
three hundred fourescore and nine steps or degrees;
each degree being three foot high, and two foote and a
halfe broad. By which computation, they amount in
heigh, to the afore-said Relation, allowing to every
foote, twelve inches. At last having ascended upon
the South side of this greatest Pyramide to the top, and
that with great difficulty, because of the broken degrees
here and there; I was much ravished, to see such a large
<PB N="212" REF="168"/>
foure squared plat-forme, all of one intire stone, which
covered the head; each square extending to seventeene
foot of my measure.</P>
<P>It is yet a great marvaile to mee, by what Engine, they
could bring it up so safe to such a height: But as I conceive
it, they behoved certainely still to rayse it, and take it
with them, as they advance the Worke, otherwise the wit
nor power of man, could never have done it. Truely the
more I beheld this strange Worke, the more I was strick∣en
in admiration: For before we ascended, or came neare
to this Pyramide, the top of it seemed as sharpe as a
poynted Dyamond; but when we were mounted thereon,
we found it so large, that in my opinion, it would have
contained a hundred men.</P>
<P>In the bottome whereof wee found a great Cell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The greatest Pyramide of the three.</NOTE> and
within that through a straight and narrow passage, a
foure angled Roome, wherein there was standing the
Relicks of a huge and ancient Tombe, where belike
hee that was the first founder of this Pyramide was in∣closed.
From the top of this Pyramide, our <HI>Ianizary</HI>
did shoote an Arrow in the ayre with all his force, think∣ing
thereby it should have falne to the ground; but as
wee discended downe-wards, we found the Arrow lying
upon the steps, scarce halfe way to the ground: From
this, wee came to the middle Pyramide which a far off
looked some-what higher then the other two, but when
we came to the roote thereof, we found it not so, for the
stone-work is a great deale lower, but the advancement
of the height, is onely because of a high ground whereon
it standeth.</P>
<P>It is of the same fashion of the first, but hath no de∣grees
to ascend upon, neither hath the third Pyramide
any at all; being by antiquity of time, all worn and
<PB N="313" REF="168"/>
demolished, yet an admirable worke to behold such
Masse, and (as it werre) erected Mountaines all of fine
Marble. The reason why they were first founded is by
many ancient Authors so diversly coniectured, that I will
not meddle therewith. They were first called <HI>Pharaones.</HI></P>
<P>Yet the first and greatest is said to have beene builded
by <HI>Cheops,</HI> who in this worke imploied 100000 men
the space of twenty yeares: In which time, the charges
of Garlicke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The charges of the greatest Pyramide.</NOTE> rootes, and Onions onely came to 1600
talents of silver; the Basis whereof in circuit, was sixty
Acres of ground. It is recorded by <HI>Iosephus,</HI> and con∣jectured
by many good witnesses, that the Brickes which
the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were inforced to make, where part∣ly
imployed about the insides of these Pyramides, whose
outsides were adorned with Marble; neither can I for∣get
the drift of that effeminate <HI>Cheops,</HI> who in end wan∣ting
money did prostitute his daughter to all commers,
by which detestable meanes he finished his building, and
shee besides the money due unto her unnaturall Father,
desired for her selfe of every man that had the use of her
body one stone, of whom shee got so many, that with
them shee builded the second Pyramide, almost equall to
the first. Besides these three huge ones, there are a num∣ber
of smaller, whereof some were transported to <HI>Rome</HI>
in the time of her supreame domination.</P>
<P>Betwene the biggest Pyramide, and <HI>Nylus,</HI> I saw a
<HI>Colosse,</HI> or head of an Idoll, of a wonderfull greatnesse;
being all of one Marble stone, erected on a round Rock:
it is of height (not reckoning the Columne) about 815
foote, and of circuite, 68. <HI>Plini</HI> gave it the name <HI>Sphin∣go,</HI>
and reported much more of the bignesse, large∣nesse,
and length of it: but howsoever he erred in his de∣scription,
yet I resolve my selfe, it is of so great a quanti∣ty,
<PB N="314" REF="169"/>
that the like thereof (being one intire piece) the world
affordeth not, and may be reckoned amongst the rarest
Wonders: Some say, that anciently it was an Oracle, the
which so soone as the Sunne set, would give an
answere to the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> of any thing by them de∣manded.</P>
<P>In our way as we returned, our <HI>Dragoman</HI> shewed us
(on the bank of <HI>Nylus</HI>) where a Crocodile was killed the
yeare before, by the ingenious policie of a <HI>Venetian</HI>
Merchant, being licentiated by the <HI>Bassaw.</HI> The match
whereof for bignesse and length, was never seene in that
River, whose body was twenty two foot long, and in
compasse of the shoulders eight foot, who thus was
slaine: This beast for foure yeares together kept alwayes
about one place of the River, being seven miles above
<HI>Cayre;</HI> where for a mile of ground, there was no tillage
nor pastorage, being for feare of him laid waste: and ne∣verthelesse
he had devoured above forty sixe persons: his
custome was to come forth of the River every morning,
about our eight houres; where here and there hee would
lurke waiting for his prey till ten, for longer from water
he could not stay.</P>
<P>This <HI>Venetian</HI> leaving his ship at <HI>Alexandrea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A resolute <HI>Venetian</HI> Mer∣chant.</NOTE> and
comming to <HI>Cayre,</HI> was informed by the <HI>Consull</HI> my
adversary of the great spoil done by this beast: and
herewith generously hee undertooke to kill it, the <HI>Vice gerent</HI>
licentiating him: Whereupon going to his ship,
fetched thence his Gunner and a peece of Ordonance to
<HI>Cayre.</HI></P>
<P>The next day in the afternoone, hee being well hor∣sed,
and accompanied with twenty <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> the peece
is carried to the <HI>Crocodiles</HI> accustomary place of forth∣comming:
where straite there was an Asse slaine, and
<PB N="315" REF="169"/>
hung upon two standing and a thwarting tree, with his
open belly to the flood, and same twelve score paces
therefro: Behinde this carkasse▪ about other twelve
score,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The killing of a great Cro∣codile.</NOTE> the piece was planted, and leveld at the Carrion,
being charged with cut iron; and a traine of powder a∣bout
the touch-hole, and above it a night house to keepe
the traine dry from the nights serene; having a cock fast∣ned
thereto, and in it a burning match, to which a string
was tyed: Then forty paces behinde the piece, was there
a pit digged to hide the Gunner; wherein he was put,
holding the strings end in his hand, and his head vayled
with a wooden cover.</P>
<P>After this, and about midnight, the Horse-men re∣tired
themselves two miles off: The morning come, and
the convenient time: the <HI>Crocodile</HI> courts the land: where
when he saw the carkasse, came grumbling to it, and
setting his two formost feet on the Carrions middle, be∣gun
to make good cheare of the intrales: whereat the
squink-eyed Gunner perceiving his time, drew the string,
and giving fire, off went the peece, and shot the <HI>Croco∣dile</HI>
in three parts: well, his deadly wounded, and
making a horrible noise, the Gunner lay denned, and
durst not stirre; meanwhile the beast striving to recover
the water, tyred and lying close on his belly there hee
died.</P>
<P>After the shot, the horse-men drew neare, and find∣ing
the beast slain, relieved the Gunner, and brought with
them this monstrous creature to <HI>Cayre;</HI> where now
his skinne hangeth in the <HI>Consuls</HI> Hall, which I saw du∣ring
my stay in his house. For this piece of service, the
Merchant was greatly applauded, &amp; scorned to take from
the City 500 Sultans of Gold as a reward for his paines,
which they freely offered him, and hee as freely refused.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="170"/>
Now to discourse of <HI>Nylus,</HI> this flood irriguateth all
the low plaines of the Land, once in the yeare, which
inundation, beginneth usually in the latter end of <HI>Iuly;</HI>
and continueth to the end of <HI>August:</HI> Which furnisheth
with Water all the Inhabitants; being the onely drinke
of the vulgar <HI>Aegyptians;</HI> and of such vertue, that when
<HI>Pescennius Niger</HI> saw his Souldiers grumble for Wine:
<HI>What</HI> (saith he) <HI>doe you grumble for Wine, having the
Water of</HI> Nylus <HI>to drinke?</HI> And now because many
schollers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true knowledge of the flowing <HI>Nylus.</HI></NOTE> and learned men, are meerely mistaken about
the flowing of <HI>Nylus,</HI> I will both show the manner and
quality or course of its inundation, and thus. There is a
dry pond called <HI>Machash</HI> digged neare unto the brinke
of the river, in midst whereof standeth a pillar of eigh∣teene
Cubites height, being equall with the profundity
of the ditch, whereby they know his increasing: and
in the yeare following if they shall have plenty or scarcity
of things.</P>
<P>Now betwene the river and this pond, there are
sixe passages or spouts digged through the Banke; where
when the River beginneth to swell, it immediately fals
downe through the lowest passage into the Pond, and
being discovered there comes forth of <HI>Cayre</HI> certaine of
the Priests called <HI>Darvishes,</HI> accompanied with a hun∣dred
<HI>Ianizaries,</HI> and pitch their Tents round about this
Quadrangled pit. In all which time of the Inundation,
they make great Feasting, rare Solemnities, with Dan∣cing,
Singing, toucking of Kettle drumms, sounding of
Trumpets, and other ostentations of joy.</P>
<P>Now as the Water groweth in the River, and so from
it debording, so it groweth also upon the Pillar stand∣ing
in this pond, which pillar is marked from the roote
to the top, with Brasses, handfuls, a foote, a span, and
<PB N="317" REF="170"/>
an inch: And so if it shall happen that the water rise but
to ten Brasses, it presageth the yeare following, there shall
be great Death, Pestilence, and Famine. And if it a∣mounteth
to twelue Cubits, then the sequell yeare shall be
indifferent. And if it swell to fifteene Brasses, then the
next year shall be copious and abundant in all things: And
if it shall happen to flow to the top eighteen Brasses, then
all the Country of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> is in danger to be drowned and
destroyed.</P>
<P>Now from the body of <HI>Nylus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Schol∣lers mistaken about <HI>Nylus.</HI></NOTE> there are about three
thousand Channels drawne through the plain, on which
passing Ditches, are all the Boroughs and Towns builded;
and through which Channels the river spreads it selfe
through all the Kingdome: Which when scoured of filth
and Wormes, and the water become cleare, then every
house openeth their Cisterne window and receiveth as
much water, as is able to suffice them till the next Inun∣dation:
Neyther doth ever the River flow any where a∣bove
the bankes, for if it should, it would overwhelme
the whole Kingdome.</P>
<P>All which Channels here, or there do make intercourse
for their streames again, to the body and branches of
<HI>Nylus.</HI> Now Stoicall fools hold the opinion, that it over∣floweth
the whole face of the Land, then I pray you,
what would become of their Houses, their Bestiall, their
Cornes and Fruites: for the nature of violent streames do
ever deface, transplant, and distroy all that they debord
upon, leaving slime, mud and sand behind their brea∣ches,
and therefore such inunding cannot be called che∣rishings.</P>
<P>There are infinite venemous Creatures bred in this
river, as Crocadiles, Scorpions, Water-Snakes, grievous
mis-shapen Wormes, and other monstrous things, which
<PB N="318" REF="171"/>
oft annoy the Inhabitants, and these who Trafficke on
the Water. This famous flood is in length almost three
thousand miles, and hath his beginning under the <HI>Aequi∣noctiall</HI>
Line, from <HI>montes Lunae,</HI> but more truly from the
<HI>Zembrian</HI> Lake in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> interior, whence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bringeth
the full growth downe into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and in a place of the
exterior <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Alpes called <HI>Catadupa:</HI> The full and
roaring of <HI>Nyle,</HI> maketh the people deafe that dwell neer
to it.</P>
<P>The infallible reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason of the flowing of <HI>Nylus.</HI></NOTE> why <HI>Nylus</HI> increaseth so every
yeare, at such a time and continuance, is onely this;
that when the Sunne declining Northward to <HI>Cancer,</HI> and
warming with his vigorous face, the Septentrion sides of
these <HI>Cynthian</HI> mountaines, the abundant Snow mel∣teth:
from whence dissolving in streames; to the Lake
<HI>Zembria,</HI> it ingorgeth <HI>Nylus</HI> so long as the matter dela∣biates:
For benefit of which River the great <HI>Turke</HI> is in∣forced
to pay yearely the tribute of fifty thousand Sul∣tans
of Gold to <HI>Prester Iehan,</HI> least hee impede and with∣draw
the course of <HI>Nylus</HI> to the Red Sea, and so bring
<HI>Egypt</HI> to desolation: The ground and policy whereof,
begun upon a desperate Warre inflicted upon the <HI>Aethio∣pians</HI>
by <HI>Amurah,</HI> which hee was constrained to give
over, under this pact, and for <HI>Nylus</HI> sake.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Nyle</HI> had many names, for <HI>Diodore</HI> named it
<HI>Aetos,</HI> to wit, <HI>Eagle,</HI> because of its swift passing over the
<HI>Catadupian</HI> heights: It was called also <HI>Egyptus</HI> of a King
so named, that communicated the same to it and to the
Countrey.</P>
<P><HI>Festus</HI> saith it was called <HI>Melos,</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> tear∣med
it <HI>Mela: Epiphanio</HI> called it <HI>Chrysoroas,</HI> that is run∣ning
or coulan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in gold. The Holy Scripture tearmeth it
<HI>Seor</HI> or <HI>Sibor,</HI> to wit, Trouble, because of the great noyse
<PB N="319" REF="171"/>
it bringeth with it to <HI>Egypt;</HI> and the same Holy Letters
call it <HI>Gehou,</HI> and <HI>Physon.</HI> The <HI>Egyptians</HI> wont to name it
<HI>Nospra;</HI> and now presently the <HI>Abassines,</HI> and Inhabitants
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> name it <HI>Abanhu,</HI> to wit, the River of a long
c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse.</P>
<P>This River maketh the Isle of <HI>Delta</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of <HI>Delta.</HI></NOTE> so like∣wise
in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> that Isle of <HI>Meroa</HI> so renowned. The
ancient Authours, could not agree, touching the mouthes
of <HI>Nylus;</HI> for <HI>Melo, Strabo, Diodore,</HI> and <HI>Heredotus</HI> place
seaven; <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> and others nine; and <HI>Pliny</HI> eleven. And
some moderne Authours affirme it hath onely foure, as
<HI>Tyrre</HI> and <HI>Behou</HI> alleage, dividing it selfe two leagues
below <HI>Cayre</HI> in foure branches, the chiefest two where∣of,
are of these <HI>Damiota</HI> and <HI>Roseta,</HI> but that is false, and
so are the opinions of all the rest, for it hath now eight
severall mouthes, and as many branches drawne from its
mayn body.</P>
<P>The Water of <HI>Nyle</HI> is marvailous sweet above all
others in the World, and that proceedeth of the ex∣treame
vigour of the Sun, beating continnually upon, it
maketh it become more Lighter, Purer and Simple;
as likewise arrousing of so many Soyles, and his long
Course.</P>
<P>And truely it is admirable, to see this River to grow
great when all others grow small; and to see it diminish,
when others grow great. So alwayes it is no wonder,
that the nature of this River should so increase, when
even here, and at home the river of <HI>Rhine,</HI> hath the like
intercourse: and at the same time, through the Town of
<HI>Geneve,</HI> and so to the <HI>Mediterranian</HI> Sea: Their begin∣nings
being both alike; from the impetuosity of raynes,
and dissolvings of Snow.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> was first inhabited by <HI>Mifraim,</HI> the sonne
<PB N="320" REF="172"/>
of <HI>Chus</HI> from whom the <HI>Arabians</HI> name the land <HI>Misre,</HI>
in the Hebrew tongue <HI>Misoriae.</HI> It was also named <HI>Ocea∣na,</HI>
from <HI>Oceanus</HI> the second King hereof. Thirdly, <HI>Ostri∣ana</HI>
from <HI>Osiris;</HI> and now <HI>Aegyptus</HI> from <HI>Aegyptus</HI> the sur∣name
of <HI>Rameses,</HI> once a King of great puissance. It borders
with <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and the Confines of <HI>Nubiat</HI> on the South.
On the North with the Sea <HI>Mediterrane:</HI> The chiefest
ports whereof, are <HI>Damieta,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> towards
the occident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The confines of <HI>Egypt.</HI></NOTE> it joyneth with the great Lake <HI>Bouchiarah,</HI> &amp;
a dangerous Wilderness confining therewith, suppo∣sed
to be a part of <HI>Cyrene;</HI> so full of wilde and venemous
beasts, which maketh the West part unaccessable: And on
the East, with the <HI>Istmus,</HI> and Confine of Desartuous <HI>A∣rabia,</HI>
and a part of the Red Sea through which the people
of <HI>Israel</HI> passed.</P>
<P>This Country was gouerned by Kings first, and lon∣gest
of all other Nations: From <HI>Orisis</HI> (not reckoning his
Regall Ancestors) in whose time <HI>Abraham</HI> went downe
to <HI>Aegypt</HI> hee and his Successours, were all called <HI>Pha∣raoes;</HI>
of whom <HI>Amasis,</HI> is onely worthy mention, who
instituted such politicke Lawes to the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
that he deserueth to be Catalogized, as founder of this
Kingdome.</P>
<P>This Race continued till <HI>Cambises</HI> the second <HI>Persian</HI>
Monarch, made <HI>Aegypt</HI> a member of his Empire: and so
remained till <HI>Darius Nothus</HI> the sixt <HI>Persian</HI> King from
whom they Revolted, choosing Kings of themselues.
But in the eighteene yeare of <HI>Nectanebos</HI> the seventh King
thereafter, <HI>Aegypt</HI> was recovered by <HI>Ochus,</HI> the eight Em∣perour
of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>In end <HI>Darius</HI> being vanquished, and <HI>Alexander</HI> King
thereof, after his Death it fell to the share of <HI>Ptolomeus,</HI>

<P>Having passed <HI>Torine,</HI> and its Princely Court, whose
present Duke might have beene the mirrour of nobility,
I kept my way through <HI>Piemont</HI> or <HI>Pedemontano,</HI> the si∣ster
of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and second Garden of <HI>Europe;</HI> and
crossing the steepe and Snowy Mountaine of Mont <HI>Cola

top that it reserveth alwayes Gradinian mist, for a mile
of way long stakes, set in the Snow each one a Spears
length from another to guide the Passinger his dangerous
way; of the which stoopes if hee faile, hee is lost for
ever.</P>
<P>After I had traversed this difficult passage; I had two
dayes journey in climbing and thwarting the Rockey and
intricated hils of <HI>Liguria,</HI> over which <HI>Hanibal</HI> had so
much adoe to conduct his Army to <HI>Italy;</HI> making a
way through the Snow, with Fire, Vineger, and Wine
When it was said of him, <HI>Viam aut inveniet Anni∣ball,
aut faciet:</HI> Leaving these Mountaines behind me, I
arrived at <HI>Niece</HI> in <HI>Provance</HI> situate on the <HI>Mediterran</HI>
Sea; and passing the Townes <HI>Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o</HI> and <HI>Cana,</HI> to night
at <HI>Furges;</HI> there were three <HI>French</HI> murderers set upon
mee in a theevish Wood twelve miles long; one of which
<PB N="336" REF="180"/>
had dogged me hither from <HI>Niece:</HI> Where having ex∣treamely
given mee a fearefull chase, for a long league,
and not mending themselves, they gave me over. Well,
in the midst of the Wood I found an Hostery, and in it,
two Women, and three young Childeren, with whom I
stayed and lodged all night.</P>
<P>After I had sup'd and going to bed, in came these afore∣said
Villaines, accompained with my Host; where, when
seene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A happy e∣scape from murder.</NOTE> they straight accused me for my flight, and threat∣ning
me with stroaks, and consulted my Death. Then I
cryed to my Host for helpe, but hee stood dumbe, for hee
was their Companion, and to second their intention his
wife made fast the lower door. Whereat being moo∣ved
with deadly feare, I pulled my Turkish gowne from
my backe, and opening my Sacket; said; Now Chri∣stian
Gentlemen, I know you are distressed, and so am
I, come search my cloathes and Budget, and if you find
what you looke for, let me dye: Alas, I am a poore stran∣ger,
newly come from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the sepulcher of
Jesus Christ, and after long travailes, and loe there is
my Patent: And concerning my flight, I sweare, I onely
fled for the safety of my life, but not for the preservati∣on
of my money, for come see I have none: my griefe
is that I have it not for you: Good gentlemen consider
the dangers that I have past amongst Infidels, and let not
your Christian hands rob mee of my turmoyled life▪ ha∣ving
nought, wherefore you should, were a lamentable
thing to do.</P>
<P>This spoken, and much more, they never seatched me,
nor touched my Wallet, but went to Counsell, where
they concluded vpon my forwardnesse in opening my
body and other things to them, that I had no money,
and therefore confirme my life, which for the former
<PB N="337" REF="180"/>
respect, and the <HI>Holy Graves</HI> sake was granted. Where∣upon
packing up my Relicks againe; they called for
Wine, and drunke divers times to mee, and after a long
spent conference, their supper making ready, they dis∣missed
me for my bed: Whither, when led by my Ho∣stesse,
I privily made the doore fast suspecting still a sud∣daine
death: Well they sup'd, and were joviall, &amp; at the
first Cocke, went forth to the woode, and the high way
for their owne ends.</P>
<P>All which time I stood Centinell, and the morning
come, my Host confessed, that onely hee had saved my
life; for swearing himselfe of their former sight; but said
he, certainely they are Murderers. Leaving him with dis∣sembling
thankes, I arrived at <HI>Furges:</HI> where I learned
that my Host was suspected to bee a Cansort with these
and many more Murderers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A guard of Horsmen for a dangerous Wood.</NOTE> well afterwards I heard, hee
was arraigned, hanged, and quartered, the house razed,
and his wife put to death; and ever since the French King,
kepeth a guard of Horse-men there to keepe that filthy
and dangerous Wood free from Murderers. For now
may I say, like to a ship that after a long Voyage, is ey∣ther
in greatest danger, or else cast away entring the
Roade and Heaven from whence she came, even so was I
cast in the most eminent perill, that I had in all my Tra∣vailes,
being on the Frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> and as it were,
(in regard of remoter places) entring the Towne wherin
I was born.</P>
<P>Having given humble thankes and lofty prayers to the
Almighty for my deliverance, I traversed <HI>Provance,</HI> and
<HI>Langadocke,</HI> where neare to <HI>Montpiellier,</HI> I met with
the French gentlemans Father, whom I relieved from
the Gallies in <HI>Canea</HI> of <HI>Candy;</HI> who being over-joyed
with my sight kindly intreated mee for eight dayes, and
<PB N="338" REF="181"/>

for my sake that his sonne was at <HI>Paris:</HI> whence continu∣ing
my Voyage to <HI>Barselona</HI> in <HI>Catelogna</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> I
gave over my purpose in going to <HI>Madrile,</HI> because of

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Rue it is, that these who make distin∣ction

<P><PB N="341" REF="182"/>
As for the science <HI>Practicke,</HI> it doth first imbrace the

doth forme the manners of one man. Secondly in <HI>Ecce∣nomick,</HI>

But for their particular divisions I am not prolixi∣ous,
as inutile to my designe in hand: diverse dedicate
themselves to the knowledg of these sciences, not know∣ing
that they forget the most necessary, to wit, the science
of the world.</P>
<P>This is it above al things that preferreth men to honors,
and the charges that make great houses and Reipublicks
to flourish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The necessi∣ry use and ho∣nor of travels.</NOTE> and render the actions, and words of them
who possesse it it, agreeable both to great and small. This
science is onely acquisted by conversation, and haunting
the company of the most experimented: by divers dis∣courses,
reports by writs, or by a lively voice in com∣municating
with strangers; and in the judicious conside∣ration
of the fashion of the living one with an other. And
above all, and principally by Travellers, and Voyagers in
divers Regions, and remote places, whose experience
confirmeth the true Science thereof; and can best
draw the anatomy of humane condition. For which, and
other respects, it holdeth true that the heart of man is in∣satiable
being set upon whatsoever object, his predomi∣nant
affection listeth; neither may reason find place in the
violent rapt of such passions for as judgment is seldome
compatable with youth, but reserved to old age; so to
<PB N="342" REF="183"/>
an unconstant disposition, every accident is a constelation,
by which best thoughts are diversified, &amp; driven from the
center of deepest resolution: whiles contrariwise the
sound set man, though by opportunity altereth his pace,
yet still keepeth his way, serveth time for advantage, not
for feare; but as the Sun setteth to rise againe, so he chan∣geth
his course, to continue his purpose. Wherein tou∣ching
my particular, whether discontent or curiosity
drove me to this second perambulation, it is best reserved
to my own knowledge: As for the opinion of others, I
little care either for there sweetest temper, or their sow∣rest
censure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors Apologie.</NOTE> for they that hunt after other mens fancies
go rather to the market to sell then to buy, and love bet∣ter
to paint the bare fashion and outsides of themselves,
then to rectify or repaire, there owne defects and errours;
where with I leave them. Then it is well, if it please me, it
is enough; my pains are mine own, &amp; not others; &amp; there∣fore
best worthy to iudge of my owne labours, being best
knowne to my selfe who dearest bought them. And so to
to make short this preamble, or conducing complement, I
come to the matter it selfe.</P>
<P>Now as I began my first voyage from <HI>Paris,</HI> so from <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
must I beginne this my second peregrination: whence
leaving the Court, the Countery and <HI>Dover,</HI> I Courted

<P>To flee hence in a word, I measured all the <HI>Netherlands</HI>
with my feet in two months space; the description where∣of
is so amply set down by modern authors; that it requi∣reth
no more: onely this, for policies, industries, strong
towns, &amp; fortifications, it is the mirrour of vertue, &amp; the

who hath exactly trod it, may say he hath seen the map of
the whole Universe:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Weiste</HI> taken by <HI>Spinola.</HI></NOTE> And now ascendimg to <HI>Cleve</HI> I came
just to Grave <HI>Mourice</HI> Campe at <HI>Rhiese,</HI> as <HI>Spineola</HI> had ta∣ken
<HI>Weisle;</HI> between which armies for fiue weeks I had free
intercourse, being kindly respected by both the Generals:
for <HI>Spineola</HI> set me at his own table, and I lay in his second
Tent nine nights; the Duke of <HI>Newenberge</HI> &amp; <HI>Don Pietrod
Toledo</HI> being there both for the time: So with the Prince
of <HI>Orange,</HI> with whom I discoursed divers times, was the
<HI>Marques</HI> of <HI>Brandiburg,</HI> certaine Nobles, and forraine
Ambassadors. All which time, O how it grieved me to
<PB N="345" REF="184"/>
see the tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> daily executed upon the
distressed Protestants of <HI>Weisle,</HI> over whom they domi∣neered
like Devils: for these afflicted Citizens, being hea∣vily
oppressed, by their unsupportable usage, were belea∣gured
with their friends, when they were held captive by
their enemies; and obeying necessity, stayed their bodies
within the walls, though their minds were without, and
intirely with the assailants.</P>
<P>Bidding adiew to these Armies, and accompanied with
a young Gentleman <HI>David Bruce,</HI> the L. of <HI>Clekmanan</HI>
his sonne, whom I conducted to <HI>Italy:</HI> scarcely had wee
out-stript <HI>Rhineberg</HI> (where Colonell <HI>Edmond</HI> was slain) a
<HI>Dutch</HI> mile, till we were both robbed of our cloaks and
pocket-moneys, with five souldiers <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Wallones;</HI>
and that within a Village, women and children beholding
us, but no man to relieve us, they being with Carts ser∣ving
<HI>Spineolaes</HI> Campe.</P>
<P>Whence the next day approaching <HI>Culloine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fabulous miracles of <HI>Culloin.</HI></NOTE> and bills
of Change answered, wee visited the falsly supposed
Tombes of the three Kings that came to <HI>Bethleem,</HI> who
as the <HI>Romanists</HI> say, lie interred there. O filthy and base
absurdnesse for their holy Mother Church to confirme
hellish and erronious lyes; for these Kings came from
the East, and from <HI>Chaldea,</HI> and not from the North: Or
if they will have them to die there and so buried, surely
this is even such another damnable errour, surpassing tra∣dition,
as their wandring <HI>Iew,</HI> the Shoomaker of <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI>
is, of whom in <HI>Rome,</HI> they have wrote ten thousand fa∣bles
and fopperies: from this we visited the 11000 Vir∣gins
heads, Martyres, indeed we saw the Church-walls
all indented about with bare sculles, but whose heads they
were, the Lord knoweth, from thence a Gentleman
brought us to a Chappell, within a vinyard, called the
<PB N="346" REF="185"/>
Chappell of miracles; the originall whereof was thus.
Upon a Festivall day, being Vintage time, there came a
Peasant to the Towne, and passing by the Vines (as there
is a number within the walls) did eat his belly full of the
Grapes; and thereafter hearing a Masse, was confessed,
and received the Sacrament: And returning the same way
hee came, and just where hee had eaten the Grapes, hee
fell a vomiting, and casting up with what hee had eaten,
the Holy Sacrament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A forged mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acle.</NOTE> it straight turned in the likenesse of
a new borne Babe, being bright and glorious. Well, the
amazed fellow, ran back and told his Confessour, what
was done, and his offence who had eaten Grapes before
the Reception of the <HI>Eucharist.</HI> The Confessour told
the Bishop, where hee, and other Prelats comming to
the place, and beholding, as it were an Angel, grew asto∣nished.</P>
<P>In the end they wrapped up their little dead god in a
cambrick veile, &amp; there buried it, building this Chappell
above the place: where ever since there is a world of lying
miracles done: Loe these are the novelties of <HI>Cullen.</HI></P>
<P>Thence ascending the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and coasting <HI>Heidleberg,</HI>
I saluted the Princesse <HI>Palatine,</HI> with certaine rare Re∣licks
of the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> And leaving Monsieur <HI>Bruce</HI>
there till my returne, I went for <HI>Norrenberg</HI> to discover
the fixe <HI>Germans</HI> deaths, whom I had buried in the De∣sarts,
and <HI>Grand Caire</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> for the two Barons
were subject to the Marquesse of <HI>Hanspauch:</HI> Where ha∣ving
met with some of their Brethren, Sisters, and Kins∣men,
and declared to them their deaths, I was presently
carried to their Prince the Marquesse, to whom I related
the whole Circumstances. Whereupon a brother of the
one Baron, and a sister of the other, were instantly inve∣sted
in their Land; and I likewise, by them all greatly re∣garded
<PB N="347" REF="185"/>
and rewarded. And after ten dayes feasting, re∣viewing
<HI>Heidleberg,</HI> mine associate and I set forward for
<HI>Helvetia,</HI> or <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>This countrey is divided in thirteene <HI>Cantons,</HI> sixe
whereof are Protestants, and six Papists, the odde <HI>Can∣ton</HI>
being likewise halfe and halfe. The most puissant
whereof is <HI>Biern,</HI> whose Territory lying along the lake
reacheth within a leagve of <HI>Geneve.</HI> The people, and
their service to most Christian Princes, are well knowne,
being Manly, Martiall and trusty faithfull.</P>
<P>Here in the <HI>Canton</HI> of <HI>Bierne</HI> neere to <HI>Vrbs,</HI> wee went
and saw a young woman, who then had neyther eate,
nor drunke, nor yet excremented for thirteene yeares, be∣ing
truely qualified by her Parents, friends, Physitians,
and other Visitors. She was alwayes Bed-fast, and so

<P>The day following we entred <HI>Geneve,</HI> where viewing
the Towne, the chiefe Burgo-masters, the seven Mini∣sters,
and the foure Captaines were all familiarly acquain∣ted
with mee. The Ministers one night propining
mee with a Bible, newly Translated in the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue,
by one of themselues borne in <HI>Milane,</HI> told me there
was a Masse-Priest sixe Leagues off a curate of a Village
in <HI>Madame du longeviles</HI> Country, who had gotten
in his owne Parish, three Widdowes and their three se∣verall
Daughters with child, and all about one time:
and for this his Luxurious Cullions was brought to <HI>Dijon</HI>
<PB N="348" REF="186"/>
to be Executed: Desiring me to go see the manner, the
next day (leaving Master <HI>Bruce</HI> with them) I went hither,
and upon the sequell day, I saw him hanged upon a new
Gallowes, as high as a house: The three mothers &amp; their
three Daughters were set before him, being <HI>Gravidato,</HI>
whose sorrowfull hearts, and eye gushing teares for their
sinne and shame, were lamentable to behold: the incestu∣ous
<HI>Bugerono,</HI> begging still mercy and pardon for dividing
their legges, &amp; opening their wretched Wombs. Lo there
is the chastity of the Romish Priests, who forsooth may
not marry, and yet may miscarry themselves in all abomi∣nation
especially in <HI>Sodomy,</HI> which is their continuall plea∣sure
and practise. Returning to <HI>Geneve,</HI> &amp; acquainting the
Magistrates with his Confession, for they are great Intel∣ligencers,
I wrot this literall Distich.</P>

<P>The lake of <HI>Geneve</HI> is sixteene Leaguhs in length, and
two broad, at the South-west end whereof standeth the
Towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake of <HI>Geneve,</HI> and the River <HI>Rhone.</HI></NOTE> through whose middle runneth the River of
<HI>Rhone,</HI> whose Head and body beginneth from the Lake
among the very houses. The nature of which River is
not unlike to <HI>Nylus,</HI> for when all other Riuers decrease
(being in Summer) this increaseth. The reasons procee∣ding
from the excessive Snow that lie upon the <HI>Sangali∣an</HI>
and <HI>Grisonean Alpes,</HI> which cannot melt, till about
our longest day, that the force and face of the Sunne
dissolve it. And so ingorging the Lake, it giveth <HI>Rhone</HI>
such a body that it is the swiftest River in <HI>Europe.</HI> The
Towne on both sides the stood is strongly fortified with
rampierd walls, and counter-banding Bulwarkes; the

with wooden stakes, for preventing of suddain Scallets.
Many assaults have this handfull of people suffered by
Land and Water from the <HI>Savoyean</HI> Duke; the recitall
whereof would plunge mee in prolixity; and therefore
committing that <HI>Light shining Sion,</HI> and her Religious
<HI>Israelites,</HI> to the tuition of the Almighty, I stept over the
<HI>Alps</HI> to <HI>Torine.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the residence of the Dukes of <HI>Savoy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first be∣ginning of the Dukes of <HI>Savoy.</HI></NOTE> whose be∣ginning
sprung first from the House of <HI>Saxon:</HI> For <HI>Berold</HI>
or <HI>Berauld,</HI> being a neer Cousin to the Emperour <HI>Otton</HI>
the Third, and brother to the <HI>Saxon</HI> Duke; the Emperour
gratified him with these Lands of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and parts of
<HI>Piemont;</HI> where he and his Successors continued four hun∣dred
yeers under the Title of Earls: untill the Emperour
<HI>Sigismond,</HI> at the Counsell of <HI>Constance,</HI> did create <HI>Amee,</HI>
the eight Earle of his name Duke. And so beginning with
him to this present Duke now living, named <HI>Charles E∣manuel,</HI>
there have been only eight Dukes, and some of
them of short lives. And yet of all the Christian Dukes,
the most Princely Court is kept here, for Gallants, Gen∣try,
and Knights.</P>
<P>At the same time, of my being there, this present Duke
had wars with his own brother in Law <HI>Philp</HI> the Third,
about the Marquesade of <HI>Montferrat,</HI> and Dutchy of
<HI>Mantua,</HI> the issue whereof, but retorted to the Duke a
redoubling disadvantage; though now it bee gone from
the <HI>Gonsagaes</HI> to the French Duke of <HI>Naviers.</HI> This
Countrey of <HI>Piemont</HI> is a marvellous fruitfull and plaine
Countrey, and wonderfull populous, like to the River

in circuite, meaning of the Habitations and populosity of
the Soyle.</P>
<P>The rest of the surnames of the <HI>Italian</HI> Dukes are
these, viz. that of <HI>Parma</HI> is <HI>Fernese,</HI> signifying Partridges;
that of <HI>Modena</HI> is <HI>Astie,</HI> that of <HI>Florence de Medicis;</HI>
that of <HI>Vrbine, Francesco Maria,</HI> and the last Duke of <HI>Man∣tua,

<P>Leaving <HI>Piemont,</HI> and coasting the sassinious shoare of
<HI>Genoaes revieroe,</HI> I ported <HI>Ligorn,</HI> the great Dukes Sea-haven;
where I left Mr <HI>Bruce</HI> with a Galley Captaine a
voluntary Souldier; and inclining along to <HI>Florence</HI> by
the way at <HI>Pistoia,</HI> I found a comfortable crosse; for I view∣ing
the market place after supper, and carrying a <HI>French</HI>
Ponyard in my pocket,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A comfortable crosse.</NOTE> the head of it was espied by a
<HI>Badgello,</HI> Captaine of the Sergeants, who straight grip∣ped
me, bore mee to prison, and clapt me in a Dungeon
robbing me of all my moneys and Ponyard; and Post∣ing
that might to <HI>Florence;</HI> on the morrow shew the Justice
there a Stilletto of his own: upon which I was condem∣ned
to row in the Gallies for a yeare, else to pay a hun∣dred
Duckets: Hee staied there three days in this time
was I discovered to the Governour of <HI>Pistoia,</HI> a noble
Gentleman, and being brought before him, and acquain∣ting
him with the undeserved cruelty of the <HI>Badgello:</HI> not
that I never wore a Stilletto, but under pretext of that, had
robbed mee of three-score and twelve pieces of Gold:
Whereupon the Governour perceiving the knavery of
the Villaine, and that he had not acquainted him with my
apprehending, to whose place it belonged, he grew discon∣tented
and forthwith sent post to his Highnesse, shewing
him the trueth of the businesse: Whereupon the <HI>Badgello</HI>
was sent backe to the Governour with whom I was do∣mestickly
<PB N="351" REF="187"/>
reserved; and being accused before my face of
his roguery, could not deny it: well, my gold and my
Ponyard is restored againe, the <HI>Badgello</HI> banished the
territory of <HI>Pistoia</HI> for ever, with his Wife and Children:
and I received in compensation of my abuses, from his
Highnesse Chamber or Treasury there, fifty <HI>Floren∣tine</HI>
Crownes of gold, being modified by the Duke him
selfe; where at I extolled the knave that wrought his own
wracke in seeking my overthrow and brought me such a
noble reward.</P>
<P>Thanking God for this ioyfull crosse, and approaching
<HI>Florence,</HI> I found one <HI>Iohn Browne</HI> there, whose compa∣ny
I imbraced to <HI>Sicilia:</HI> Whence having privately past
<HI>Rome,</HI> and publickly <HI>Naples,</HI> we footed along the marine
by <HI>Salerno,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Consenza</HI> is <HI>Calabria.</HI></NOTE> and courting <HI>Consenza</HI> the capitall seate of <HI>Ca∣labria</HI>
where a <HI>Vicegerent</HI> remaineth, we reposed there cer∣taine
dayes.</P>
<P>The Towne is of no quantity nor quality, in regard of
the obscurenesse and solitarinesse of the Countrey, the
better sort of their Gentry living at <HI>Naples:</HI> having left
the lower, and entred the higher <HI>Calabria,</HI> wee arrived at
the Bourge of <HI>Allauria;</HI> and the next morrow traversing
close and couert mountaines twelve miles along, in the
midst of our passage wee were beset with foure Bandits
and foure Guns: To whom holding up my hand, and
imploring for our lives, shewing them mine adventures
and former travells, they unbend their fire-locks, and
reading my parent of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> uncouered their heads,
and did me homage, notwithstanding they were absolute
murderers: Our lives and liberty is granted, and for a
greater assurance, they tooke us both into a great Thicket
of wood, where their timber Cabin stood, and there
made merry with us in good Wine and the best cheare
<PB N="352" REF="188"/>
their sequestrate Cottage could afford.</P>
<P>And now because there were Forty more Bandits their
companions among these mountaines, one of themselves
for our safeguard, came along with us, and as neare <HI>Ca∣stellucia</HI>
as hee durst; making mee sweare that I should not
shew the Baron of that place of their private residence, nei∣ther
that I met with them at all; which I freely did, and
so gave him many hearty, and deserved thanks.</P>
<P>These Bandits or men-slayers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The liberty of <HI>Bandits</HI> in <HI>Calabria.</HI></NOTE> will come into any
free Towne in the night when they please, and recove∣ring
either a Church or Hospitall, they stay there as they
list, conducing with their friends, their wives, and their
affaires; being as safe in these places, as though they had
not committed any criminall fact; neyther may the pow∣er
of Justice reach to them, so long as they keepe them∣selves
within doores.</P>
<P>This is an ancient liberty which <HI>Calabria</HI> hath ever re∣tained,
and so is through the most part of all the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Dominions: Having arrived at <HI>Castelucia,</HI> the Baron
thereof made much of mee, &amp; wondred that I had safely
past the mountaines; for said he when I go for <HI>Naples,</HI> I am
forced to go by sea, notwithstanding I have forty in train.</P>
<P>The next day in passing <HI>Montecilione,</HI> the fairest &amp; fruit∣fullest
bounded Bourg in all <HI>Calabria superior;</HI> I saw a di∣stecture
house, which the people told me had beene the
Schoole, where <HI>Dionysius</HI> the third &amp; last Tyrant of <HI>Sici∣lia</HI>
(after his flight from the Kingdome &amp; Crown) taught
Children privately nine yeares, ere he was knowne to bee
a King, but a poore Schoolmaster.</P>
<P>The higher <HI>Calabria</HI> though mountanous, aboundeth
in delicious Wines, fine pastorage, and exceeding good
Silke: The Peasants alwayes commonly here are ad∣dicted
to eate Onions, whence rose this Proverbe, I <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣labrese

magniano di Cepoli,</HI> the <HI>Calabrians</HI> feed upon Oni∣ons.
Their women weare uncomely habits, being hoo∣ded
from their browes to their backes behind, with sixe
or seven sundry colours of cloth or stuffe; whose upper
gownes come no further downe than there middle
thighes: And their breeches and stockings being all one,
and their legs halfe booted, they looke like the ghost∣ly
<HI>Armenian Gargosons.</HI></P>
<P>I remember in passing this higher Countrey, I found
divers <HI>Cassales</HI> or <HI>Terraes,</HI> (small Villages) of certaine
<HI>Greekes</HI> called <HI>Albaneses,</HI> whose predecessors had fled
from <HI>Albania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Greek, Alba∣neses</HI> fled to <HI>Calabria.</HI></NOTE> when the <HI>Turke</HI> seased upon <HI>Epyre,</HI> and
this their Province; and was privileged here to stay by
the <HI>Spaniard Philip</HI> the first: And though exiled from
their naturall Patrimonies (<HI>Omne solum forti patria est</HI>)
yet are they exceeding kind to stranger, measuring large∣ly
their owne infranchized fortune, with the voluntary
exposement of many unnecessary <HI>Viadants:</HI> Declining
thence to the marine Bourge of <HI>Molino,</HI> being by land
which wee footed distant from <HI>Naples</HI> 400 miles; wee
crossed the narrow <HI>Faro,</HI> or <HI>Sycilian Euripus,</HI> to <HI>Messina</HI>
being two miles broad. Where, when landed and mee∣ting
with a young <HI>Scots Edenburgensen, William Wylie,</HI>
come from <HI>Palermo,</HI> and bound for <HI>Venice,</HI> I fastned
<HI>Iohn Browne</HI> with him to accompany his returne; and on
the following day imbarked them both backe for <HI>Cala∣bria.</HI></P>
<P>And now having followed the <HI>Italian</HI> saying <HI>Simegli∣or
a star solo come mala accompaniato,</HI> it is better for a
man to bee alone, then in ill company; I traversed the
Kingdome to <HI>Trapundie</HI> seeking transportation for <HI>Af∣fricke,</HI>
but could get none: And returning thence over∣thwart
the Island, I call to memory being lodged in the
<PB N="354" REF="189"/>
Bourge of <HI>Saramutza,</HI> belonging to a young Baron, and
being bound the way of <HI>Castello Francko</HI> eight miles di∣stan
and appertaining to an other young Noble youth, I
rose and marched by the breach of day where it was my
lucke halfe way from either Towne to finde both these
beardlesse Barons, lying dead, and new killed in the fields,
and their horses standing tyed to a bush beside them;
whereat being greatly moved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two young Barons killed at combat.</NOTE> I approached them, and
perceiving the bodies to be richly clad with silken Stuffes
easily conjectured what they might bee: My host having
told mee the former night, that these two Barons were
at great discord, about the love of a young Noble wo∣man;
and so it was, for they had fought the combat for
her sake, and for their own pride lay slaine here. For as
fire is to Gun-powder, so is ambition to the heate of man;
which if it be but touched with self-love, mounteth aloft,
and never bendeth downeward, till it bee turned into
ashes.</P>
<P>And here it proued for that Ladies sake that <HI>tropp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a∣more</HI>
turnd to <HI>Presto dolore:</HI> Upon which sight, to speake
the trueth, I searched both their pockets, and found their
two silken purses full loaded with <HI>Spanish</HI> Pistols; where∣at
my heart sprung for joy, and taking five rings off their
foure hands, I hid them and the two purses in the ground,
halfe a mile beyond this place: And returning againe,
leapt to one of their horses, and came galloping backe to
<HI>Saramutza;</HI> where calling up my host, I told him the ac∣cident;
who when he saw the horse gave a shout for sor∣row,
and running to the Castle told the Lady the Barons
Mother: where in a moment, shee, her children, and the
whole Towne runne all with mee to the place, some clad,
some naked, some on foote, and some on horse: where,
when come grievous was it to behold their wofull and
<PB N="355" REF="189"/>
sad lamentations. I thus seeing them all mad and di∣stracted
of their wits with sorrow, left them without
good night: And comming to my Treasure, made spee∣dy
way to <HI>Castello Francko,</HI> where bearing them the like
newes, brought them all to the like distraction and flight
of feet.</P>
<P>Well, in the mutability of time there is aye some for∣tune
falleth by accident, whether lawfull or not. I
will not question, it was now mine that was last theirs,
and to save the thing that was not lost, I travailed that
day thirty miles further to <HI>Terra nova.</HI> Whence the next
morning beeing earely imbarked for <HI>Malta,</HI> and there
safely Landed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>London</HI> ship called the <HI>Matthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> I met with a ship of <HI>London</HI> called the
<HI>Mathew,</HI> bound for <HI>Constantinople</HI> lying in the Road;
where indeed with the company I made merry a shoare
for three dayes, and especially with one <HI>George Clerke</HI>
their Burser, who striving to plant in my braines a
<HI>Maltezan</HI> Vineyard, had almost perished his owne
life.</P>
<P>Upon the fourth day, they hoysing sayle, and I staying
a shoare, it was my good luck within eight dayes to find
a French ship of <HI>Tolon</HI> come from the <HI>Levant,</HI> and bound
for <HI>Tunneis</HI> by the way in going home. With whom
desirously consorted, within three dayes wee touched at
our intended Port. And now to reckon the gold that I
found in the aforesaid purses, it amounted to three hun∣dred
and odde double Pistols; and their Rings being set
with Dyamonds, were valued to a hundred Chickeens of
<HI>Malta,</HI> eight shillings the peece, which I dispatched for
lesser: But the gold was my best second, which like <HI>Ho∣mers
Iliads</HI> under <HI>Alexanders</HI> pillow, was my continuall
<HI>vade mecum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tunneis</HI> is the Capitall seat of its owne Territory, and

of all the East and lower <HI>Barbary,</HI> containing ten thousand
fire-houses: And it is the place where old <HI>Carthage</HI> stood,
that was builded by the <HI>Tyrians</HI> and <HI>Phenicians</HI> of the <HI>Ho∣ly

had twenty miles in circuite: Which City in these times,
was the soveraign Queen of <HI>Affrick,</HI> and the onely envy,
and predominiant malice of the <HI>Romans,</HI> being more
then <HI>Romes</HI> rivall mate, in greatnesse, glory, and domini∣on:
Neverthelesse in end it was taken, sackt and burnt by
<HI>Scipio</HI> the <HI>Affrican Roman,</HI> some six hundred and two
yeares after <HI>Rome</HI> was first founded &amp; her ruines &amp; large

<HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="360" REF="192"/>
At last upon the twelfth day of our leaving <HI>Tunneis,</HI>
having arrived at <HI>Algier,</HI> and abandoning my Conduct
with a good respect, I stayed in a Spaniards house, tur∣ned
Runnagate, who kept a roguish Tavern, and a ground
planked Hospitall. In all this way of twelvescore
miles I payed no Tribute, neither had I any eminent
perrill, the Countrey being peaceable, though the people
uncivill.</P>
<P>This Towne of <HI>Algier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vish towne of <HI>Al∣gier.</HI></NOTE> was formerly under subject∣on
to the Kingdome of <HI>Tremizen,</HI> but because of insup∣portable
charges it revolted, and rendered to the King
of <HI>Arradetz</HI> or <HI>Bugia:</HI> Afterwards it was under the King
of <HI>Spaine,</HI> from whom <HI>Barbarossa</HI> did take it <HI>Anno</HI> 1515,
being now under the <HI>Turke,</HI> and is situate upon the pen∣dicles
of a flat devalling height, and standeth triangular.
The Marine side whereof is strongly fortified, with earth▪
back'd walles, Bulwarkes, and artilley, but the semi∣squared
land-walles, are of small importance, and easily
to be surprised; and three miles in circuite, containing
some thirty thousand persons.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Turkish Bashaw</HI> here and a strong Garrison
of sixe thousand <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> with two hundred Cursary
ships or Pirats, who ever preying upon Christian Com∣mercers,
by their continuall spoiles and prises, have
made the divelish Town wonderfull rich; and become an
inveterate enemy of Christendome; being now a King∣dome
of it selfe, and in length from East to West be∣tweene
the Townes <HI>Terracot</HI> and <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>argola,</HI> some sixe
score miles. It had a long reaching mould in the Sea,
that maketh a safe harbor for their ships against Norther∣ly
windes, which on that Coast are deadly dangerous.
At this time, the greatest part of the Towne were fled to
the mountaines, to shun the parching heate that beateth

violently on the Plaines, and Sea-shoare; so doe all the
maritine Townes of <HI>Barbary</HI> the like every Sommer, for
the moneths <HI>Iuly, August,</HI> and <HI>September:</HI> which then
being left halfe naked of defence, it were the onely time
for Christians to invade or surprise their Towns.</P>
<P>I found here abundance of slaves, most of them <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
whom they daily constrain within Towne to
beare all manner of burdens here and there, and without
Towne to drudge in the fields amongst their Vines, and
Cornes, and other toyling labours, abusing them still
with buffets and bastinadoes as their perverstnesse listeth:
Neither durst I leave my lodging, unlesse I had three or
foure Christian slaves to guide me, and gard me too from
scelerate vulgars, who beare no respect to any stranger nor
free <HI>Franck.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A naturall sublime po∣licie.</NOTE> Here I remarked a wonderfull policy in the

they licenciate them to make havock &amp; seaze upon all o∣ther

small ship, ruled by rash fellowes should adventure with∣in
the straits, as too many English doe, being unable

and remaine therein punishment, then any reliefe
or redemption to be wrought for them, who will naked∣ly
hazard themselves in knowne perrils, without Ordo∣nance,
munition and a burdenable ship.</P>
<P>But reverting to my purpose, the marine Provinces
which lye between <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Sewty,</HI> over against <HI>Gi∣belterre</HI>
being the Straits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Barbarian</HI> Provinces twixt <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Gibelterre</HI></NOTE> are these; <HI>Cerene, Barca, Mar∣morica,

of <HI>Tunneis, Abiroh, Arradetz, Tremizen, Al∣gier,</HI>
and a part of <HI>Fez;</HI> extending to two thousand and

cannot distinguish parts nor provinces, but even as the
Orientall <HI>Turkes</HI> do, that denominate all <HI>Asia minor,</HI>
under the name <HI>Carmania,</HI> and know no further of their
ancient not particular titles.</P>
<P>Now as concerning their Customes, it is the fashion of
all these <HI>Barbarian Moores,</HI> in marrying of their wives,
that after the Bridegroome and the Bride are inrolled by
their <HI>Totsecks</HI> or Priests in the <HI>Mosque</HI> before the Parents
of each party, and the Bride presently brought home
to the house of her husband, accompained with all their
Friends, Musicke, and Reueling: Hee immediately with∣draweth
her to a private Chamber, having onely one
old woman standing by them in a corner of the Roome:
where hee lying with the Bride, and shee being found a
Maide by a certaine cloath laid under her privy place,
<PB N="363" REF="193"/>
which being by the old <HI>Hagge</HI> drawne out, and found
sprinkled with spots of blood, shee presenteth it first to
him, as a token of virginity; and then forthwith run∣neth
through the house, among all the friends of the
new married couple, crying with a loud voice, and car∣rying
the bloody napkin in her hand, the Virgin-bride
is broken up; whereat they all rejoyce, giving rewards
and good chear to the Cryer: But if the bride be not found
a Mayd, then hee returneth her backe unto her parents,
which they account as an immor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all shame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The triall of <HI>Moorish</HI> Brides.</NOTE> and the nup∣tiall
feast, and all the assistants thereunto are suddenly dis∣missed:
But if a Virgin, the banquet continueth all the
first day, with great cheare, dancings, revellings, with
Musicall Instruments of divers sorts.</P>
<P>The second night is onely the feast of women for both
parties; and the third banquet is made on the seventh
day after the nuptiall, the provision of which the fa∣ther
of the Bride sendeth to the house of his new sonne
in law: where after this banquet, and the seventh day,
in the next morning the Bridegroome goeth then a
broad from his house (which hee doth not till the afore∣said
time) unto the market place, where hee buyeth a
number of fish to carry with him to his dwelling, as a
signe of good lucke, it being an ancient custome through
the most part of all the Northern <HI>Affrick.</HI></P>
<P>The men and women at such meetings dance a part,
each of them having their owne Musicke and orders of
meriment.</P>
<P>They have also a custome when that Infants beginne

The women through all <HI>Barbary,</HI> weare abundance of
Bracelets on their armes, and Rings in their eares, but not
through the nose and lips as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> doe; and turne
also the nayles of their hands and feete to red, accoun∣ting
it a base thing to see a white naile: The men here for
the most part, are the best Archers, and Horse-men that
are in <HI>Affrick,</HI> and take great pleasure in breeding of their
<HI>Barbes:</HI> So are they both active, and curragious, and very

<P>Whence advancing our way, some on Mules, and some
on foot, with Asses carrying our baggage and provision;
we left the marine Townes of <HI>Saly</HI> and <HI>Tituana,</HI> far to the
West on our right hand, and facing the in-land wee
marched for three dayes through a fruitfull and populous
soyle: And although the people barbarous and disdaine∣full
countenances were awfull, yet we two went still free
of tributes, as not being a thing with them accustomary, to
execute exaction on <HI>Francks</HI> as the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Moores</HI> do
in <HI>Asia;</HI> neither understood they what wee were, be∣ing
clad with company and after their fashion: save one∣ly
that nature had set a fairer stamp on my face, than
theirs, which oft I wished had beene as blacke as their
uglines. In this misculat journeying of paine and pleasure,
<PB N="365" REF="194"/>
we found every where strong Wines, abundance of excel∣lent
bread, and the best, and greatest Hens bred on the
earth, with plenty of Figs, Fruits, Olives, and delicious
Oile, yea, and innumerable Villages, the Houses whereof
are all builded with mud, and platformed on their tops;
and so are they in <HI>Asia,</HI> and all <HI>Affrick</HI> over.</P>
<P>Upon the fourth day having past the Plains, we entred
in a Hilly Countrey, yet pastorable; where I beheld here
and there clouds of Tents, filled with maritine people,
that were fled hither from the Sea coast for the fresh and
cooling aire.</P>
<P>And upon these pleasant and umbragious heights, I saw
the fields overclad with flocks of Sheep and Goats: which
Sheep are wondrous great, having from their rumps and
hips, broad and thick tayls growing, and hanging to the
ground, some whereof when sold, will weigh 16, 18, or
20 pounds weight, and upwards. Here among the Moun∣tains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My arrivall at <HI>Fez.</HI></NOTE>
our company knowing well the Countrey, tooke a

and one of our Drudges to attend him. And bearing
the charges of the other two, according to the former
condition: I set forward for my purpose, which ere long
turned to sad Repentance.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Ahetzo</HI> behind us, and entring the Coun∣trey

us for five dayes together South-eastward, and almost

in a dis-inhabited Countrey, being Desertuous and dange∣rous
for Wilde beasts, and full of Mountaines. Pitching
our Tent, neare to a Rock, we burnt all that night shrubs
of <HI>Tara,</HI> to affright the Beasts of all kinds, and so did wee
every night of that wofull wandring, which flaming light

their nature cannot abide. Day come, and our comfort yet
fresh, wee sought further in, thinking to find people and
Tents to relieve us with victuals, and informe us of the
Countrey, but we found none, neither seven dayes there∣after.
The matter growing hard, and our victuals &amp; water
done, we were forced to relie upon Tobacco, and to drink
our owne wayning pisse, for the time a fore-said.</P>
<P>The Soyle we daily traced, was covered with hard and
soft Sands; and them full of Serpents, being interlarded
with Rockey heights, faced with Caves &amp; Dens; the very
habitacle of Wilde beasts, whose hollow cryes, as we heard
in the night, so we too often sighted their bodies in the
day, especially Jackals, Beares, and Boares, and somtimes
Cymbers, Tygers, and Leopards, against whom in the

upon the fourth day of our seven being there, fal∣ling

<PB N="377" REF="200"/>
with death, to make mee seeke backe for our nearest re∣fuge:
Whereupon holding our course North-east, my
compasse-Dyall being our guide, wee rancountred earely
on the eight day, with nine hundred Savages, naked <HI>Ly∣bian
Sabunks:</HI> five hundred whereof, were women ar∣med
with Bowes and Arrows; who with their compli∣ces,
the former night had put to the sword three hundred
<HI>Berdoanes,</HI> their neighbour tribe: carrying away above
sixe hundred Sheepe and Goats besides other bestiall:
from whom after our sight of their <HI>Emeere</HI> or Prince, wee
had first liberty of life, and then reliefe of food; for hee
came up in the Reare, with a hundred Horse-men charged
with halfe Pikes, headed at both ends with sharpe Steele:
The person of their Prince was onely clothed from his
brests downe to his middle thigh with a Crimson vaile
of Silke hanging on his naked shoulders with coloured
Ribans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Sabun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks</HI> apparell.</NOTE> and on his head, a party coloured Shash▪ set like
a Garland: Both his knees were bare, so were his ancles,
the calues of his legges being girded with Crimson Silke;
and on his feet yellow shooes, his beard was like his face,
burnt with the Sunne, and his age like to my owne, of 33
yeares, his Religion is damnable, so is his life, for hee
and all the foure Tribes of <HI>Lybia</HI> worship onely for their
god, Garlick, having altars, Priests and superstitious
rites annexed to it: Thinking Garlicke, being strong of it
selfe, and the most part of their food, to have a soveraigne
vertue in a herball Diety. All his Courters were starke
naked, saving his Page, who was even covered like to the
King his Master.</P>
<P>And now having dismissed his Army for the way, and
falling in an houres parley with us at his departure; he pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pyned
me with his Bowe, &amp; a Quiver of Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owes, which

<P><PB N="378" REF="201"/>
There is a merry secret heare concerning the women,
which often I recited to King <HI>Iames</HI> of Blessed memory,
showing him also three Certificats of this my Desartu∣ous
wandring: one of which was confirmed by English
<HI>Ward</HI> at <HI>Tunneis</HI> upon the <HI>Dragomans</HI> Report; though
now they with all my other Patents are lost, in the In∣quisition
of <HI>Malaga.</HI> This former savage Prince, sent a
Guide with vs for foure dayes journey, the condition of
his mans Wages being made by himselfe, and franckly
advised us that <HI>Tunneis</HI> was our best and nearest recourse.
Which being forcibly considered, I was constrained to
renew my bargaine agayne with the <HI>Dragoman,</HI> at the
rate of forty five Sultans of gold to bring mee safely hi∣ther.</P>
<P>This <HI>Sabunck</HI> Guide, to whom I gave five Sultans, thir∣ty
five shillings, brought us through the most Habitable
vallies, and best cled passages of the Countrey with
Tents: where every day once wee found Water, Bread,
Garlick and Onions, and sometimes Hennes at twenty
<HI>Aspers</HI> the piece, two shillings▪ which we would Rost, or
scorch dry (if trueth may have credite) at the very face
of the Sunne, and so eate them. Upon the fift day, our
Guide leaving us in the after-noon, well setled among
foure hundred Tents of <HI>Numidian Moores,</HI> or bastard
<HI>Arabians,</HI> pitched in a pleasant Valley between two
sources of Water, wee stayed still there Reposing our
selves, and refreshing our bodies with Victuals, some
nine dayes,</P>
<P>Heere among these Tents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moorish Smiths forg∣ing horsshoos out of cold Iron without fire, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat of the Sun</NOTE> I saw Smiths Worke out

hireling, with a greater consideration, then
my two former conditions allowed me: Yet
being urged to it by Captaine <HI>Ward,</HI> I freely performed
his Direction. My Conduct gone, and I staying heere, Cap∣taine
<HI>Ward</HI> sent twice one of his servants with me, to see
two sundry Ovens drawne, being full of young Chickens,
which are not hatched by their mothers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he hatching of Chickens without their mothers.</NOTE> but in the Fur∣nace,

answerable to the naturall warmnesse of the Hens belly;
upon which moderation, within twenty dayes they

an usuall thing, almost through all <HI>Affricke,</HI> which ma∣keth
that the Hennes with them are so innumerable every

<P>And now it was my good fortune, after five Weekes
attendance for Transportation, being about the 14 of
<HI>February</HI> 1616, to meete here with a <HI>Holland</HI> ship called
the <HI>Mermaide</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> being come from <HI>Tituana,</HI>
and bound for <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Malta,</HI> touched here by the way.
In this time of their staying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>Dan∣sers</HI> employ∣ment.</NOTE> came one Captaine <HI>Danser</HI>
a Fleming, who had beene a great Pirate and Comman∣der
at Seas, and the onely inveterate enemy of the <HI>Moores;</HI>
being imployed by the French King in Ambassage, to
relieve two and twenty French Barkes that were there
Captivated, done by the policy of the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> to draw
<HI>Danser</HI> hither; notwithstanding that he was then Reti∣red
and married in <HI>Marseilles.</HI></P>
<P>Well, he is come, and Anchored in the Roade, ac∣companied
with two <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen: Two of which
came a shoare, and saluted the <HI>Bashaw</HI> in <HI>Dansers</HI> be∣halfe:
they are made welcome, and the next day the <HI>Ba∣shaw</HI>
went franckly aboord of <HI>Danser,</HI> seconded with
twelve followers: <HI>Danser</HI> tooke the presence of the <HI>Ba∣shaw</HI>
for a great favour, and mainely feasted him with
good cheare, great quaffing, sounding Trumpets, and
Roaring shots, and none more familiar then the dissem∣bling
<HI>Bashaw,</HI> and overjoyed <HI>Danser,</HI> that had relieved
the Barks, for they were all sent to him that morning, not
wanting any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="203"/>
After deepe cups, the <HI>Bassaw</HI> invites him to come a
shoare the day following, and to dine with him in the
Fortresse: To the which unhappy <HI>Danser</HI> granted, and
the time come, he landed with twelve Gentlemen, and
approaching the Castle, was met with two <HI>Turks</HI> to receive
him: where having past the draw-bridge, &amp; the gate shut
behind him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The untime∣ly death of Captain <HI>Dan∣ser</HI> a Fleming born.</NOTE> his company was denied entrance: where
forthwith <HI>Danser</HI> being brought before the <HI>Bassaw,</HI> was
strictly accused of many ships, spoiles, and great riches he
had taken from the <HI>Moores,</HI> and the mercilesse murther of
their lives, for he never spared any: Whereupon he was
straight beheaded, and his body throwne over the walles
in a ditch; which done, off went the whole Ordnance of
the Fort, to have sunke <HI>Dansers</HI> two ships; but they cut∣ting
their Cables, with much adoe escaped; but for the o∣ther
Gentlemen a shoare, the <HI>Bassaw</HI> sent them very cour∣teously
and safely aboord of the redeemed Barks, whence
they hoised Sailes for <HI>Marseilles.</HI></P>
<P>Loe there was a <HI>Turkish</HI> policy more sublime &amp; crafty,
then the best <HI>Europian</HI> a live could have performed. A litle
while thereafter, the aforesaid <HI>Hollander</HI> being readie to
go for Sea, I bad good night to generous <HI>Ward,</HI> &amp; his for∣ward
Runnagats, where being imbarked with prosperous
windes; upon the third day we landed at <HI>Malta,</HI> and there
leaving my kind <HI>Flemings</HI> and their negotiation, I cour∣ted
the shoare, saluting againe my former hoste.</P>
<P>The fift day of my staying here, I saw a <HI>Spanish</HI> Soul∣dier
&amp; a <HI>Maltezen</HI> boy burnt to ashes, for the publick pro∣fession
of <HI>Sodomy,</HI> and long ere night, there were aboue a
hundred <HI>Bardassoes,</HI> whorish boyes that fled away to <HI>Si∣cilie</HI>
in a Galleyot; but not one <HI>Bugeron</HI> stirred, being
few or none there free of it: The Knights that remaine
here, as they are of divers Nations, so have they diuers
<PB N="383" REF="203"/>
manners and inclinations; how soever they of the better
sort, are resolute in their atchievments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maltezes</HI> anciently did adore the Goddesse <HI>Iu∣no,</HI>
whose Temple was superbiously adorned with rich
decorements, and to which, for homage and devotion,
came all the Inhabitants of the circumjacent Isles, bring∣ing
rich presents and guifts; and they were also hono∣red
with the Temple of <HI>Hercules,</HI> the ruines of which ap∣peare
to this day.</P>
<P>Now as for the order of Knight-hood, the oath
which is made at their receiving the order of St. <HI>Iohn,</HI>
or of the Religion of the holy Hospitall of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The formall oath of the Knights of <HI>Malta.</HI></NOTE> is
this: I vow and promise to God, to the most blessed
Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the Mother of God, and to our glorious
Patron St. <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>Babtist,</HI> that by the grace and helpe
of Heaven, I shall ever be obedient to the superiour, that
God and this Religion have appointed; and from hence∣forth
that I shall live chast, forsaking marriage and all o∣ther
lusts, and to be without the proper possession of any
thing that may be mine.</P>
<P>After this, the Chappell clarke, a Priest of the order,
receiving him with divers ceremonies, taketh a blacke
Cloak in his hand, and shewing him the white crosse
that is fixed thereon, demandeth if hee doth not beleeve
that to bee the signe of the Crosse whereon <HI>Iesus Christ</HI>
was crucified for our sinnes: he confesseth it, kissing the
Crosse: After which, his receiver putteth the crosse of
the Cloake upon the heart and left side of the new made
Knight, saying, Receive this signe in the name of the tri∣nity,
the blessed Mother of God, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and
of St. <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> for the augmentation of the Ca∣tholick
faith, the defence of the Christian name, and ser∣vice
of the poore: Also we put this crosse on thy left side,
<PB N="384" REF="204"/>
to the end that thou maist love it with all thy heart, and
with thy right hand for to defend it: And in fighting a∣gainst
the enemies of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> thou shalt happen to
flee, and leave his holy Signe behind thee, thou shalt of
good right be depraved of this holy religious order, and
of our company: This done, hee knitteth the Gordon of
the cloak about him saying; Receive the yoke of our Lord
that is sweet, and light and thou shalt finde rest for thy
soule: Thus spoke, he kisseth the Gordon, and so doe all
the circumstanding Knights, and there are made unto
him divers Orations and precepts, contained in the Book
of their Ordinances: They have a Priest-hood too of
this same order, being Masse-Priests that weare this badge
of the white Crosse.</P>
<P>Now bidding farewell to <HI>Malta,</HI> and to mine afore∣said
Countrey Gentleman <HI>William Dowglas,</HI> I landed the

I begin to give you a perfect description thereof.</P>

<L>An Ile with corners three, out-braves the Main</L>
<L>From whence the name <HI>Trinacry</HI> it doth gaine.</L></Q>
<P>It is now called <HI>Sicilia</HI> from the <HI>Siculi</HI> or <HI>Sicani</HI> who
possessed it, and hath beene famous in all former ages:
<PB N="385" REF="204"/>
By <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> it was cognominated the <HI>Paragon</HI>
of Isles: By <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> the Garden of <HI>Italy:</HI> It was al∣so
anciently called the <HI>Grange</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and is ne∣ver

beside Trapundy; growing under the water greene and

Sea, and gulfe of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The most of the Townes and Villages within land,
are builded on the highest hills and greatest heights in the
Countrey; the reason is two-fold; first it serveth them for
strength: and a great defence in time of cursary invasi∣ons,
of which divers be so strait in ascending that one
man may easily resist and beat downe five hundred. The
second is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns set on heights re∣serve good ayre.</NOTE> because their dwellings being farre above the
parching plains, these situations are good preservatives
for their health, where on they have a sweet and cooling
ayre, which in such a hot climat, is the soveraigne salve
to prevent sicknesse.</P>
<P>Their Villages be farre distant, some sixe, ten, fifteene
twenty miles, one from another; in all which grounds
there is no sequestrate house, unlesse (being a high way)
it bee a Fundaco or Inne. About the sides of the hills,
whereon their Townes stand, grow all their Winds, and
on the Plaines nothing but red wheat, which for god∣nesse
is unparralleled, and the best bread and a bundance
<PB N="386" REF="205"/>
of it in the world is here. <HI>Sicilia</HI> was formerly devided

of <HI>Matzzara</HI> containing <HI>Palermo, Trapundy, Malzara,</HI>
and the angle of <HI>Cap di passero</HI> of old <HI>Pachinum:</HI> Many
thinke that <HI>Sicilia</HI> was rent from <HI>Italy</HI> by the violence
of waters, at the generall Deluge, some by infinit Earth∣quakes,
and some simply conjecture the cause to have
proceeded from combustious <HI>Aetna,</HI> which is meere ridi∣culous.</P>
<P>There are divers grounds and valleys in this Isle, that
abound so in Wheat, that the Inhabitants recoile a hun∣dred
measures for one, and commonly are called the
fields of a hundred measures.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sycilians</HI> for the most part are bred Orators,
which made the <HI>Apulians</HI> tearm them, men of three
tongues: besides they are full of witty sentences, &amp; plea∣sant
in their rancounters,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sicilians</HI> are brave Orators</NOTE> yet among themselves, they are
full of envie (meaning their former kindnesses was unto
strangers) suspicious and dangerous in conversation, being
lightly given to anger and offences, and ready to take re∣venge
of any injury committed: But indeed I must con∣fesse,
more generously than the <HI>Italians,</HI> who murder
their enemies in the night; for they appeale other to
single combat, and that manfully without fraudulent
practices.</P>
<P>They are curious, and great lovers of novelties, and
full of quicknesse and rare inventions in all kind of Sci∣ences,
great intelligencers and lovers of histories: As I
found in divers of them, who knew the passages formerly
<PB N="387" REF="205"/>
of my Countrey so exquisitely that I was astonished at
their relations so agreeable with the trueth and times
past. The Parlament of <HI>Sicily</HI> hath a wonderfull great au∣thority,
in so much that the <HI>Viceroy</HI> cannot have the free
gift (as they call it) which is every third yeare, nor no
extraordinary thing, nor the renewing of any matter con∣cerning
the common-wealth, without the generall con∣sent
of the whole Kingdome: The generall Counsell
whereof is composed of three branches called by them
the armes of the Kingdome:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Counsell of <HI>Sicilia.</HI></NOTE> viz. first the Prelats, and in∣feriour
Clergy men named the arme Ecclesiastick: se∣condly
of Barons called the arme Military: and the third
the Commissioners of Cities and Townes intitulated the
arme Signioriall: The Crowne-rent of this Kingdome
amounteth, to a million and a halfe of Duccats yearely,
which being disbursed euer for intertaining of Captaines,
Garrisons and of Gallies and cursary ships, the Badge∣loes
and servants for the fields, the maintaining of Tow∣ers
and watches about the coasts, the reparations of Col∣ledges,
high-wayes, Lords pensions, and other defrayings,
there rests little, or nothing at all to the King.</P>
<P>I remember in my twice being in this Kingdome, (es∣pecially
the second time, wherein I compassed the whole
Island, and thrise traversed the middle parts thereof from
Sea to Sea) I never saw any of that selfe Nation, to begge
bread or seeke almes; so great is the beatitude of their
plenty. And I dare avow it (experience taught mee)
that the poorest creature in <HI>Sicily</HI> eateth as good bread,
as the best Prince in Christendome doth. The people are
very humane, ingenious, eloquent and pleasant, their lan∣guage
in many words is neerer the <HI>Latine,</HI> then the <HI>I∣talian,</HI>
which they promiscuously pronounce, some∣what
talkative they are, and effeminate, but gene∣rally
<PB N="388" REF="206"/>
wonderfull kind to strangers. In the moneths of <HI>Iu∣ly</HI>
and <HI>August,</HI> all the Marine Townes every yeare, are
strictly and strongly guarded with them of the inland Vil∣lages
and Bourges, both on foote and horse-backe: who
are compelled to lie there at their owne charges, so long
as this season lasteth; in which they feare the incursions
of the <HI>Turks;</HI> but the rest of the yeare, these Sea-coast
Townes are left to the vigilant custodie of the Indwel∣lers</P>
<P>This Countrey was ever sore oppressed with Rebells
and Bandits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Sona</HI> Vice-roy of <HI>Sicilia.</HI></NOTE> untill such time that the military Duke of
<HI>Sona,</HI> came to rule there as <HI>Viceroy, Anno</HI> 1611. where in
the first yeare he brought in five hundred; some whereof
were hanged, some pardoned, and some committed to
the Gallies: So that within two yeares of his foure yeares
government, there was not a Bandit left at random in
all <HI>Sicilia;</HI> the like before was never seene in this Re∣gion,
nor one in whom <HI>Astreas</HI> worth was more ho∣noured,
infortitude of mind, and execution of true
Justice that this Duke before whose face the silly ones
did shine, and the proud stiffe-necked oppressors did
tremble.</P>
<P>And in a word, he has no suppressor of the sub∣jects
(as many now be) to satisfie either licentious
humours, or to inrich light-headed flatterers, but serving
Justice, he made Justice serve him: for the equity of
Justice of it selfe, can affond none, neither of any will it
be offended; unlesse the corrupt tongue and hand of the
mercenary Judge suffer sound judgment to perish for
temporary respects; which this noble Governour could
never doe, neither suffer any inferiour Magistrate to
doe the like under him: As it well appeared by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
proceedings against thy <HI>Iesuits</HI> of <HI>Pale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o</HI> and his au∣thority
<PB N="389" REF="206"/>
upon them imposed in spight of their ambition.
The circumstances whereof, were very plausible, if time
did not slaughter my good wil; and yet my patience could
performe my paines with pleasure.</P>
<P>And likewise against a Seminary Gallant, a Parochiall
Priest of that same City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An equitable Justice for in∣justicesake.</NOTE> who had killed a Knights ser∣vant
in a Brothel house, the brother of a Shoomaker,
which fellow, the <HI>Viceroy</HI> caused, to Pistoll the Priest in
spight of the Cardinall, and there upon absolved him for
the dead.</P>
<P>This Cardinall having onely for the Priests fact, dis∣charged
him to say Masse for a yeare, without satisfacti∣on
for the mans life: so the Duke inhibited the Shoo∣maker
to make shooes for a yeare, and neverthelesse
allowed him two shillings a day to maintaine him for that
time.</P>
<P>Many singular observations have I of his government,
the which to recite, would prove prolixious, though wor∣thy
of note to the intellective man, hee was afterward
<HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> and now lately deceased in <HI>Spain.</HI> It
is dangerous to travell by the Marine of the Sea-coasts
Creekes in the West parts, especially in the mornings,
least hee finde a <HI>Moorish</HI> Frigo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lodged all night, under
colour of a Fisher boat, to give him a slavish break-fast:
for so they steale labouring people of the fields, carrying
them away captives to <HI>Barbary;</HI> notwithstanding of the
strong Watch towers which are in every one sight of a∣nother,
round about the whole Island.</P>
<P>There arrivalls are usually in the night, and if in day
time, they are soone discovered; the Towers giving
notice to the Villages, the Sea-coast is quickly clad with
numbers of men on foot and horse-backe: And of∣tentimes
they advantagiously sease on the <HI>Moores,</HI>
<PB N="390" REF="207"/>
lying in obscure clifts and bayes. All the Christian Isles
in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, and the Coast of <HI>Italy</HI> and
<HI>Spaine,</HI> inclining to <HI>Barbary,</HI> are thus chargeably guarded
with watch Towers.</P>
<P>The chiefest remarkeable thing in this Isle from all An∣tiquity
is the burning hill of <HI>Aetna,</HI> called now <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
Bello,</HI> or <HI>Gibello,</HI> signifying a faire Mountaine, so it is, be∣ing
of height toward <HI>Catagna</HI> from the Sea side, fifteene
<HI>Sicilian</HI> miles, and in Circuite sixty. The North side
toward <HI>Rindatza</HI> at the Roote being unpassable steepe;
yet gathering on all parts so narrow to the top, as if it
had been industriously squared, having a large prospect
in the Sea; about the lower parts whereof grow exceeding
good Wines, Cornes, and Olives.</P>
<P>And now in my second Travails,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My second view of <HI>Aet∣na.</HI></NOTE> and returning from
<HI>Affricke,</HI> I not being satisfied with the former sight, the
kind Bishop of <HI>Rindatza</HI> courteously sent a Guide with
me on his owne charges, to view the Mountaine more
strictly. Ascending on the east and passable part, with
tedious toile, and curious climbing, wee approached
neare to the second fire being twelve miles high; which
is the greatest of the three now burning in <HI>Aetna:</HI> whose
vast mouth, or gulfe is twice twelve-score long and wide,
lying in a strait valley between a perpendiculur height
and the main Mountaine; whose terrible flames, and
cracking smoak is monstous fearefull to behold.</P>
<P>Having viewed and reviewed this, as neare as my
Guide durst adventure (the ground meane while where∣on
wee stood warming our feete, and is dangerous for
holes, without a perfect Guide) wee ascended three
miles higher to the maine top of <HI>Cima,</HI> from which the
other two fires had their beginning. Where when come,
wee found it no way answerable to the greatnesse of the
<PB N="391" REF="207"/>
middle fire; the other two drawing from it the substance,
wherewith it hath beene anciently furnished; yet be∣tween
them two upper fires, I found abundance of
Snow (being in <HI>Iuly</HI>) lying on the septentrion sides of
the Hill. It was here in this upmost Fornace, that <HI>Empe∣docles</HI>
the Phylosopher cast himselfe in, to be reputed for
a God.</P>
<Q><L>—De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s immortalis haberi</L>

<L>Insiluit—</L>
<L>To be a god this curious Wretch desires</L>
<L>And casts himselfe, in the fierce <HI>Aetnean</HI> sires.</L></Q>
<P>As we discended on the North-east side, we came to
the third and lowest fire, which is within a short mile of
the Mountaines foote, over against <HI>Rindatza;</HI> and if it
were not for a sulphurat River, which divideth the
Towne and the Hill, it would be in danger to be bur∣ned.
This last and least fire runne downe in a cumbusti∣ble
flood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lowest and third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Ae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></NOTE> from the middle above, <HI>Anno 1614. Iune</HI> 25.
Where the Sulphure streames, before it congealed, fal∣ling
in a bituminous soyle, where Wine and Olives grew
there seazed, and daily augmenteth more and more; ha∣ving
quite spoiled the Lands of two Barons in <HI>Rindatza:</HI>
But the king of <HI>Spaine,</HI> in recompence of their misera∣ble
mishaps, did gratifie them with some of his Crowne
lands for their maintenance.</P>
<P>I speake it credibly, I have found the Relickes of these
Sulphure streames, which have burst fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th from the up∣most
tops of <HI>Aetna</HI> Westward, above twenty miles in
the plaine. The reason of such ardent disgorgements,
is thus; that when the aboundance of Sulphure, being put
<PB N="392" REF="208"/>
on edge with excessive Raine, and the bitumenous sub∣stance
still increasing; which by the chaps, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lits, and hol∣low
chinkes of the ground (rent partly by the Sunne, and
by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e forcing flames) is blowne by the Wind, as by a
paire of Bellowes; the valt or vast bosome, of which
ugly Cell; not being able to containe such a composi∣ture

so long as the heate remaineth: and growing
cold, it congealeth in huge and blacke stones, resembling
Minerall mettall, and full of small holes, like to the
composed Cinders of a Smiths Forge, where with the
Houses of nine Townes Circumjacent thereunto, are buil∣ded.</P>
<P>This is that place, which the Poets did report to bee
the shop of <HI>Vulcan,</HI> where <HI>Cyclops</HI> did frame the thun∣der-bolts
for <HI>Iupiter:</HI> Whereof <HI>Virgill</HI> doth make his
Tract, called <HI>Aetna.</HI> Under this hill the Poets faine the
Giant <HI>Enceladus</HI> to be buried, whose hot breath fireth the
Mountain, lying on his face; and to conclude of <HI>Aetna,</HI> the
grosse Papists hold it to be their Purgatory.</P>
<P>The chiefe Cities therein are <HI>Palermo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palermo.</NOTE> the seate of the
Viceroy, situate in the North-west part ouer against
<HI>Sardinia:</HI> It is a spacious City, and well watered with
delicate Fountaines, having goodly buildings, and large
streetes, whereof <HI>Stradoreale</HI> is principall, being a mile
long. In which I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e seene in an evening march a long

being tyed to every Coach: the Gallies of <HI>Sicilia</HI> which are

<P>The second is <HI>Messina,</HI> toward the East, over against
<HI>Regio,</HI> in <HI>Calabria;</HI> being impregnable and graced with a
famous haven: having three invincible Castles, the chiefe
<PB N="393" REF="208"/>
whereof, is Saint <HI>Salvator</HI> by the Sea side; there be di∣vers
other Bulwarkes of the Towne wals, that serve for
offensive and defensive forts, which is the cause (in deri∣sion

<P>The third is <HI>Syrac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa,</HI> standing on the Southeast Coast
fifty miles beyond <HI>Aetna,</HI> and halfe way twixt <HI>Messina</HI>

in Ruby Corall, which setteth the halfe of the Towne at

<P>This City is in great request amongst the Papists, be∣cause
of the miraculous Lady heere, reputed the Islands
Protector and sole Governour of these narrow seas, for
Ships, Gallies, and Slaves: which indeed if an image
cut out in wht Marble were so powerfull, it might

<P>The first is <HI>Catagna,</HI> placed at the Marine foot of <HI>Aetna,</HI>
that was so vexed by <HI>Dionisius</HI> the Tyrant. The sixt is

<P>This Kingdome after it was rent from the <HI>Romans,</HI>
remaining in subiection under the <HI>French</HI> till the yeare

absolute opposition, and conditionall disagreement in all
fashions; and in their riding both different and defective:
For the <HI>Spaniard</HI> rideth like a Monkey mounted on a
Camell, with his knees and heeles alike aside, sitting on
the sadle, like to a halfe ballast ship, tottering on top-tem∣pestous
waves: And the <HI>French</HI> man, hangeth in the stir∣rop,

ostentation, pricking his horse with neck-stropiat
spurs, and beating the winde with his long waving
limbes, even as the <HI>Turkes</HI> usually doe, when they are tos∣sed

shedding teares, nor sorrowfull in heart, for they will

<P>This Island finally is famous, for the worthy Schollers

<P>But to proceede in my itinerary relation having twice
imbarked at <HI>Messina</HI> for <HI>Italy,</HI> from <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africke,</HI>
I have choosed the last time (double experience, deeper

at <HI>Naples,</HI> as in the one place shall be succinctly tou∣ched.</P>
<P>Here I found some 60 Christian Gallies, assembled to
the Faire of <HI>Messina,</HI> which holdeth every yeare the 17
of <HI>August:</HI> Wherein all sorts of Merchandize are to be
sold, especially raw Silke in abundance: thirty of which
Gallies went to scoure the coasts of <HI>Greece. Messinai</HI>
foure miles distant from <HI>Rhegio</HI> in <HI>Calabria,</HI> and two
miles from the opposite Maine. This <HI>Regium</HI> was that
Towne where Saint <HI>Paul</HI> arrived after his shipwracke at

we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etched up the little Isle of <HI>Strombolo:</HI> This Isolet is a
<PB N="399" REF="211"/>
round Rock, and a mile in Compasse, growing to the top
like to a <HI>Pomo,</HI> or <HI>Pyramide,</HI> and not much unlike the
<HI>Isolets</HI> of <HI>Basse</HI> and <HI>Elsey,</HI> through the toppe whereof, as
through a Chimney arriseth a continuall fire, and that so
terrible, and furiously casting forth great stones &amp; flames
that neither Galley nor Boate, dare Coast or boord it.</P>
<P>South from hence, and in sight thereof, on the
North Coast of <HI>Sicily</HI> lie the two Islands <HI>Valcan Maior</HI>
and <HI>Minor;</HI> whereof the lesser perpetually burneth, and
the greater is long since consumed. On the fourth day
we touched at <HI>Ischa,</HI> the greatest Isle belonging to <HI>Naples,</HI>
and 20 miles in Circuite, being strongly begirded with
Rockey heights. The chiefe Towne is <HI>Ischa,</HI> whither
<HI>Ferdinando</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> fled, being thrust out of his King∣dome
by <HI>Charles</HI> the eight.</P>
<P>There is a Fountaine here of that incredible heate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A boyling Fountain in the Isle of <HI>Isha.</HI></NOTE>
that in short time will boile any fish or flesh put in it, and
the tast agreeable to disgestion. Departing from thence,
and coasting the maine shoare, we had a Moorish Frigot
in Chafe, where seizing on her, we found 16 <HI>Moores</HI>
therein, and sixe Christians, three Men, two Women,
and a Boy, whom they had taken up, in going betwene
two Townes by the Sea side. The Peasants were set at
liberty, and the <HI>Moores</HI> immediately preferred to chaines
of Iron, bloody lashes, tugging of Gally oares, and per∣petual
slavery.</P>
<P>Neere the marine, and in sight of <HI>Naples,</HI> wee boor∣ded
close by the foote of the Hill <HI>Vesuvio,</HI> which in time
past did burne, but now extinguished: It was here that the
elder <HI>Pliny</HI> who had spent all his time in discovering the
secrets of Nature, pressing neer to behold it, was stifled
with the flame, so that he dyed in the same place, which
is most excellently described in the Booke of his
<PB N="400" REF="212"/>
<HI>Epistles</HI> by his Nephew the younger.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Naples,</HI> I gave joyfull thankes to God for
my safe returne to Christendome, and the day follow∣ing,
I went to review the ancient Monuments of <HI>Put∣zolo</HI>
or <HI>Pute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li:</HI> Which when I had dilligently remarked,
in my returne halfe way to <HI>Naples,</HI> I met the aforesaid
English Gentleman and Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> who neeedes would
have mee turne backe to accompany them hither. When
come, wee tooke a Guide, and so proceeded in our sights:
the first thing of any note we saw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The antiqui∣ties of <HI>Putzolo</HI></NOTE> was the stupendious
Bridge, which <HI>Caius Caligula</HI> builded betwene <HI>Putzolo</HI>
and <HI>Baia,</HI> over an arme of the Sea, two miles broad:
Some huge Arches, Pillars, and fragments thereof re∣maine
unruined to this day: The next was the new made
Mountaine of Sand, which hath dryed up <HI>Lago Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri∣no</HI>
being by an Earth quake transported hither; at the
foote of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abulous Hill, we saw the remnants of <HI>Ci∣ceroes</HI>
Village.</P>
<P>Thence wee came to the Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> standing on
the East side of <HI>Lacus Avernus,</HI> the Walles whereof,
and pendicles (the Tecture excepted) are as yet undemo∣lished.</P>
<P>This Lake <HI>Averno</HI> is round, and hemb'd in about with
comely heights, being as our Guide reported infinitely
deepe, and in circuite a short mile. The West end where∣of,
is invironed with the Mountaine of <HI>Cuma,</HI> whither
<HI>Aeneas</HI> arrived when hee fled from <HI>Dido</HI> Queene of <HI>Car∣thage,</HI>
and sister to <HI>Pigmalion</HI> King of <HI>Tyrus.</HI></P>
<P>Advancing our way, along the brinke of the Lake, we
came to <HI>Sybillaes</HI> Cave, the entry being darke because
of the obscure passage, between out and cut through the
maine Rocke, our Guide strooke fire, and so with a
<HI>Flambo</HI> marched before us. The first passage was ex∣ceeding
<PB N="401" REF="212"/>
high <HI>Cim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and the further end stopped with
moulding earth. Inclining to our right hand, wee passed
through a very strait and low passage, and so arrived in
<HI>Sybillaes</HI> Chamber, which is a delicate Roome, and Ar∣tificially
decored with <HI>Mosaicall</HI> Worke: Here it is said,
the Divell frequented her Company, and where shee
wrot her Prophecies. From thence hee conducted us
through a most intricate and narrow way, (wherein wee
were forced to walke sidling in) to a large and vast Room▪
The Rockey vault whereof, was hanging full of loose
and long stones, many of which were fallen to the bot∣tome.</P>
<P>This great Cell or Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The old di∣ning room of <HI>Sybill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> is a yard deepe of blackish
Water, and was the dining Room of <HI>Sybilla.</HI> In which,
hearing toward the further end, ascriking noise, as if it
had beene the croaking of Frogs, the hissing of Serpents,
the bussing of Bees, or snarling of Wolves; we demanded
our Guide from whence such a sound proceeded: Who
answered, they were Dragoris and flying Serpents, pray∣ing
us to Returne, for the fellow was mightily affraid:
Whereat I laughing, Replyed, there was no such matter;
and Mr <HI>Stydolffe</HI> desirous to know it, hee onely and I lea∣ving
the other two behind us, adventured the tryall: Ha∣ving
more then halfe way entered in this Sale, stepping
on huge stones because of the Water, and I carrying the
<HI>Flambo,</HI> for lacke of aire, being so far under ground the
light perished. Whereupon wee hollowed to our Guide,
but the Reverberating Eccho avoyded the sense of our
words, neither would he nor durst hee hazard to support
us.</P>
<P>Meanewhile it being Hell-darke, and impossible to
find such a difficult way backe, and tendering (as by du∣ty)
the worthy Gentleman, I stepped downe to my
<PB N="402" REF="213"/>
middle thigh in the water, wrestling so along to keep
him on the dry stones. Where indeed, I must confesse,
I grew affrighted, for my legs, fearing to be interlaced
with water Serpents, and Snakes, for indeede the di∣stracting
noise drew nearer and nearer us. At last,
falling neare the voice of our guide, who never left
shouting, wee returned the same way wee came in,
and so through the other passages, till wee were in open
fields.</P>
<P>Here indeede for my too much curiosity, I was con∣diginly
requited, being all bemired and wet to the mid∣dle,
yet forthwith the vigorous Sunne disburdned mee
quickly thereof: from thence (to be briefe) wee came to
the <HI>Bagni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient varieties of the antiqui∣ties of <HI>Put∣zolo.</HI></NOTE> the relicts of <HI>Pompeis</HI> Village, to the fort of
<HI>Baja,</HI> and the Laborinth of <HI>Ciento Camarello,</HI> into the ad∣mirable
fish ponds of <HI>Lucullus;</HI> (the coverture of which,
is supported by 48 naturall pillars of stony earth) to the
detriments of <HI>Messina, Mercato sabbato,</HI> and the <HI>Elisian</HI>
fields: Thence wee returned by the sepulcher of <HI>Agricu∣la,</HI>
the mother of cruell <HI>Nero,</HI> who slit up her belly to
see the matrix wherein he was conceived; and by the two
decayed Temples of <HI>Venus,</HI> and <HI>Mercury:</HI> Crossing o∣ver
in a boat to the Towne of <HI>Putzolo,</HI> the chiefe monu∣ment
wee saw, was the ancient Temple of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> who
serveth now for their <HI>Domo,</HI> or Parochial Church: the
latter Idolatry of which, is nothing inferiour to the
former.</P>
<P>Meanwhile here arrived the <HI>French</HI> Gallies, fetching
home <HI>Chevalier du Vandum,</HI> the Prior of <HI>France</HI> from
<HI>Malta:</HI> Who scouring the coast of the lower <HI>Barbary,</HI>
their fortune was to fall upon a misfortunate <HI>English</HI> ship
belonging to Captain <HI>Pennington,</HI> which they, as a Cur∣saro
or man of warre, confiscated. Their Anchors fal∣len,
<PB N="403" REF="213"/>
I boorded the Queenes Galley, where to my great
griefe I found a Countrey-man of speciall acquaintance,
<HI>George Gib</HI> of <HI>Burowtownnes</HI> (who was Pilot to the
<HI>English</HI>) fast chained to an oare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Master of <HI>a Scots</HI> ship distressed by evill misfor∣tune.</NOTE> with shaven head and

at the Isle <HI>Sardinia,</HI> and sold her at <HI>Naples</HI> being mise∣rably
worme eaten. To whose undeserved miseries,
in my charitable love, I made a Christian oath, that at my
arrivall in <HI>England,</HI> I should procure, by the helpe of his
friends, his Majesties letters to the Duke of <HI>Guyse</HI> Ad∣mirall,
for hindeliverance. But soon thereafter, being of
a great spirit, his heart broak, and so died in <HI>Marseiles.</HI></P>

<P>Departing from <HI>Putzolo,</HI> we came to the <HI>Selphatara,</HI>
where the fine Brimstone is made, which is a prety incir∣cling
Plain, standing upon a moderate hight; having three
vents, through two of which, the smoaking flame ariseth,
&amp; the other produceth no fire; but after an excessive raine
surgeth six foote high with black boyling water, which
continueth so long as the raine lasteth.</P>
<P>From thence (our Guide leaving us) we came to <HI>Grot∣to
di cane;</HI> wherein if a Dogge be cast he well suddenly
die, and taken thence, and cast in the Lake, he will forth∣with
revive: this <HI>Grotto</HI> or Cave, standeth on the side
and root of a sulphure hill, the brinke of <HI>Lago di Avagno:</HI>
We desirous to make triall of a Dog; and finding the fel∣low
<PB N="404" REF="214"/>
that purposely stayeth there, somewhat extortiona∣ble,
I adventured in stead of a Dog to make tryall of my
selfe; Whereupon Master <HI>Stydolffe</HI> holding up the quar∣rered
doore, I entered to the further end thereof, bring∣ing
back a warme stone in each hand from thence, where∣at
the <HI>Italians</HI> swore, I was a Divell and not a man: for
behold (say they) there was a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman the for∣mer
yeare, who in a bravado, would needes goe in; where∣upon
he was presently stifled to death, and here lyeth bu∣ried
at the mouth of the <HI>Grotto,</HI> to serve for a caveat, to all
rash and unadvised strangers to doe the like.</P>
<P>The relation indeede was true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dange∣rous Dogs Cave neer un∣to <HI>Putzolo.</HI></NOTE> put I counting nothing
of it, would needes (sore against the Gentleman and Ma∣ster
<HI>Woods</HI> will) goe in againe, where entred to the bot∣tome,
being ten paces long, the moyst and choaking
heat did so suffocate and benumbe my senses, that with
much adoe I returned backe; where receiving the fresh
aire, and a little Wine, I presently forgot my former
trance: which when the Dog-keeper saw, hee for an easie
composition made triall of his Dog; and having tyed a
string to his hinder leg, he cast the Dog scarce halfe way
in the Cave, where immediately his tongue hanging out,
he fell downe dead: And forthwith his Master repulling
him backe, cast him in the Lake, powring in water in his
eares, but hee never could recover his life. Whereupon
the poore man cryed out, alas I am undone, what shall
I doe, the Dog that wonne my daily fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d is dead; in
compassion whereof, the worthy Gentleman doubled his
wages.</P>
<P>In our way and returne to <HI>Naples,</HI> we passed through
<HI>Virgils Grot,</HI> being halfe a mile long, and cut through a
the maine body of a Rocke, whereby the Mountaine of
<HI>Cataja</HI> by the Sea-side is made passable; at the East end
<PB N="405" REF="214"/>
whereof neare the Cyme of the vault is <HI>Virgils</HI> Tombe:
and arrived at <HI>Naples,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Stydolffe</HI> reporting to
divers of his Countrey Gentlemen and mine, of mine ad∣venture
in <HI>Grotto di Cane,</HI> they could hardly be perswa∣ded
to believe it: But when avouched, they all avowed I
had done that (so did divers <HI>Neapolitans</HI>) which never
man had done before me reserving life.</P>
<P>Bidding farewell to my generous friends, I marched
through <HI>Terra di lavora,</HI> and in the way of Saint <HI>Germane,</HI>
and Mount <HI>Cassino</HI> to <HI>Rome;</HI> within ten miles of <HI>Capua,</HI>
I found the poorest Bishop (<HI>Nomen sine re</HI>) the world af∣foordeth:
having no more (nor never had he, nor any be∣fore
him) than <HI>dui Carolini</HI> or <HI>Iuletti,</HI> twelve pence a day

his legs, a good suit of clothes on his backe, and
his belly well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, so glorious are their stiles and so mise∣rable
their revenewes.</P>
<P>Touching at <HI>Rome,</HI> I secretly borrowed one nights
lodging there, and at the breake of day, another houres
sight and conference, with my Couzen <HI>Simeon Gra∣hame;</HI>
who ere the Sunne arose crossing <HI>Ponto flamingo,</HI>
brought mee on in my journey, till a high way Taverne

West.</P>
<P>And now ere I leave <HI>Rome,</HI> I thinke it best to let our Pa∣pists
here at home, see the shamefull lives &amp; cruell deaths,
of most of their Popes beyond Seas: which their own
best Authors in <HI>France, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> having justly and
condignely avouched and recorded; &amp; authorized also to
light by their prime powers civil &amp; spirituall. The Papists
<PB N="406" REF="215"/>
generally hold, that in their popes, is all power, <HI>Super
omnes Potestates, tam Coeli, quam Terrae;</HI> above all powers
both in Heaven and Earth: They terme him <HI>Alter Deus
in Terris;</HI> a second God upon the Earth, <HI>Deus mortalis in
terris, ei immortalis homo in Coelis;</HI> a mortall God upon
the Earth, and an Immortall man in the Heavens: Some
of them have allotted, that hee is <HI>Non Deus, non homo, sed
utrunque;</HI> neither God nor man, but both: The popes
former title was <HI>Servus servorum Dei;</HI> and they call him
<HI>Rex Regum, Dominus Dominantium,</HI> King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords.</P>

a plaine Stew or Brothel house?</P>
<P>What a pope-boy of twelve yeares old, was <HI>Benedict</HI>

Pope they had, whom they called <HI>Vnum pecus, in

A very Asse, for in the morning hee would grant many
great kindnesses, and at night revoke them all againe.
What a thiefe was pope <HI>Boniface</HI> the seventh? who rob∣bed
St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church? what a Sodomiticall Pope was
<HI>Sixtus</HI> the fourth? who builded Stews of both kindes,

23 was deposed by the counsel of <HI>Constance,</HI> for Heresie,

Concubine <HI>Stephana:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papists may looke here upon de∣villish Popes.</NOTE> He was a gamster, and playing

his predecessor <HI>Celestine,</HI> in speaking through the

noster,</HI> at a Masse saying, or a Masse said them:
<HI>Si cavano fuora dalla Purgatorio, tre anime qualche ci
vogliano, viz.</HI> You shall reliefe any three soules out of
purgatory whom you please. Nay I have seen the popes
Edict so gracious, that induring one Masse, as many <HI>Pa∣ters</HI>
as you can recite, as many soules you free from
thence.</P>
<P>And thus me thinketh in one halfe yeare, he might
soone empty that purging pit: Yet unlesse the Suppliant

the Altar; their <HI>Balla,</HI> their payment for it, their
<HI>Paters,</HI> their devotion for their friends soules, are all lost.
They say if peradventure, the friends of the defunct
be oblivious in this officiousnesse, and neglect both the
Ceremony, and <HI>Pater noster,</HI> might not the Pope justly
be reputed a cruell Monster, that for want of pattering
an abridged <HI>Pater,</HI> his <HI>Cerberian</HI> Office in Hell, should
detaine any poore soule in such torments, as they say are
in Purgatory.</P>
<P>Infinite passages of the like kind could I recite, if I
had longer time and larger leasure; and especially of their
miraculous lyes, or lying Miracles; in erecting of fals∣hood,
and maintaining of periury; but till a fitter oca∣sion,
I will revert to my Itinerary Discourse, and so pro∣ceede.
Having left mine aforesaid friend Master <HI>Gra∣hame</HI>
at a Taverne at <HI>Bilbo</HI> neere to <HI>Rome,</HI> I set for∣ward
through the vale of <HI>Ombria,</HI> and the Countrey <HI>Ro∣mania,</HI>
whereof <HI>Ravenna</HI> is Lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ravenna</HI> the chief City of <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia.</HI></NOTE> and the Pope Lord,
I arrived (the way of <HI>Ferrara</HI> and <HI>Padua</HI>) at <HI>Venice.</HI> Who
then was levying an army against the <HI>Croation</HI> Scokes of
<HI>Gradisca,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Grasso</HI> now Emperour, of
which Army Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> was generall, and with
whom I crossed the Gulfe to <HI>Pola</HI> in <HI>Istria,</HI> and from
thence to the siege of <HI>Gradisea:</HI> The discourse whereof,
I have here formerly avouched in the second part of my
first Travailes. Now to speake of a Souldier, certainely
hee is more then praise-worthy and fortunate, that
hath faced the Low Countries, reviewed <HI>Briscia</HI> in <HI>Lom∣bardy,</HI>
and footed and sighted the Arsenal of <HI>Venice;</HI> then
his eyes have first seen, the sonnes, the force, the policies
and Kingdome of <HI>Mars:</HI> Secondly the fiery shoppe of
<HI>Vulcan,</HI> where rarest Armes and Weapons are ham∣mer'd
out upon the Anvill, for the honour of <HI>Mars;</HI> and
<PB N="412" REF="218"/>
lastly the incomparable Armory or store-house for Sea &amp;
Land, the <HI>Magazin</HI> and treasury of <HI>Mars.</HI></P>
<P>Now leaving both the armies barking at other like to
<HI>Hercanian</HI> wolves, I traced the fertile soyles of <HI>Carindia,
Carneola</HI> and <HI>Stria,</HI> even to <HI>Vienna,</HI> all which were sub∣ject
to the Emperour, save a part of <HI>Carneola,</HI> that groanes
under the <HI>Turke.</HI> Being arrived at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I found the
Towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Au∣stria</HI> no way answerable to common fame.</NOTE> and the flying fame of it far different, either for
greatnesse, strength, or wealth: for the Towne rising
upon a moderate height circular, is but of small compasse
without, nor passing two <HI>English</HI> miles.</P>
<P>The suburbs round about, being twice as great as the
Towne; and the strength of it is no way comparable to a
hundred Cities that I have seene, neither is it for wealth
so much to be admired, being depraved of Seas, shipping,
and navigaion, having onely the needfull prosperity of
dry land Townes.</P>
<P>Here I found a <HI>Turkish</HI> Ambassador, going downe
the Champion <HI>Danubio</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> for <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI>
and with him <HI>Gratianus</HI> a <HI>Greeke</HI> his Interpre∣ter,
to whose familiar love I was much obliged; and
with whom I imbarked downe the river to <HI>Presburg:</HI>
a place where the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Crowne is kept, and
from thence discending the River to <HI>Comorre,</HI> the down∣most
Towne the Emperour retayneth on <HI>Danubio,</HI> I
left my noble interpreter, and traversed the Champain
Countrey.</P>
<P>The Chiefe Townes whereof I will briefly touch, &amp; so
proceed <HI>Buda:</HI> is the capitall Citie of <HI>Hungary,</HI> where∣in
the <HI>Turkish Bassaw</HI> hath his residence and was ta∣ken

<P>Neare the same place is <HI>Stridon,</HI> whey they say Saint

Towne of <HI>Gamorra,</HI> standeth in an Isle of the <HI>Danuby</HI> of

never could surprise it.</P>
<P>There is also <HI>Tockay,</HI> and <HI>Iauuarin</HI> or <HI>Rab</HI> seated too
upon <HI>Danuby,</HI> a Town as it were impregnable, yet it was

<P>The soile of <HI>Hungary</HI> aboundeth infinitely in all things

may compare with the Wines of <HI>Candy,</HI> yea and aboun∣deth
in all kind of bestiall, that it is thought this King∣dome
may furnish all <HI>Europe</HI> with Beefe and Mutton.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> are descended of the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> a peo∣ple
of <HI>Scythia</HI> or <HI>Tartary.</HI> The auncient Inhabitants di∣vided
their hàbitations in nine circles, which the <HI>Ger∣manes</HI>
named <HI>Hagyes,</HI> and impaled them with high
walls, made of earth and wood being twenty foote high,
and as much in breadth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first plan∣tation of <HI>Hun∣gary.</HI></NOTE> being rampired with diverse Bul∣warks,
and towers of earth, whereon grew all sorts of
hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and fructiferous trees.</P>
<P>The space from side to side of each one of these cir∣cles,
amounteth to twenty <HI>Dutch</HI> miles, the Townes,
Villages and houses being within, and so contrived, that
each one was within cry of an other, this was the first ad∣mirable
plantation of the <HI>Hunnes</HI> in this Kingdome.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> haue ever been thiftuous, treche∣rous
and false, so that one brother will hardly trust
another; which infidelity among them selves and distract∣ed
deceitfull governours, was the chiefest cause of their
<PB N="415" REF="219"/>
overthrow and subjection under Infidels: And so have
corrupt Counsellours, and insolent Princes beene the
ruine of their owne Kingdomes; for if we would have a
Prince fit to governe others, and so direct him selfe with
the square rules of wisdome and judgement, to know
how to become all places, and to use all fortunes, let
him bind his tender youth with a disposition tempered
with sadnesse: for such a man can never seduce his mi∣nority
with ill examples, nor marre his waxen age with a
false impression, too common a condition of these dess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lute
times.</P>
<P>Now as for the <HI>Hungar</HI> soile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The infinite riches of <HI>Hungary.</HI></NOTE> and Kingdome it selfe, &amp;
for the goodnesse of it, it may be tearmed the girnell of <HI>Ce∣res,</HI>
the garden of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> the Pastorage of <HI>Pan,</HI> and the ri∣chest
beauty of <HI>Silvan:</HI> for I found the wheat here grow∣ing
higher then my head, the vines over looking the trees,
the Grasse jusling with my knees, and the high-sprung
Woods, threatning the clouds: surely if I should enter on
particulars here, I have more subject to worke upon, than
any kingdome that ever I saw: The kingdome is diviped
in two parts the higher and the lower, the lowest, largest,
and best is under the <HI>Turke,</HI> and the other narrow propor∣tion
under the Emperour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles are the longest upon the earth, for
every one of theirs, is six of our <HI>Scots</HI> miles, nine <HI>English:</HI>
so that the most that ever I could travell in one day,
was but sixe miles: Their language hath no affinity with
any other kind of speech, and yet the greatest part of
the Countrey both under the <HI>Turke</HI> and Emperour, are
Protestants, and are the best of all the rest, the rest being
<HI>Arians</HI> and papists.</P>
<P>There is a great Gentry in this Kingdome, but untra∣velled
abroad, farre lesse mannerly at home, being luxuri∣ous
<PB N="416" REF="220"/>
and ill taught, and damnably given to that Mascu∣line
misery, the whole Southerne World is defiled with.
Having now traversed all the countrey to <HI>Grana,</HI> and so
to <HI>Gatterad</HI> in <HI>Valechia,</HI> I found the Country so covered
with Woods, and them full of Murtherers, (for I was
robbed on these confines, and hardly saved my life) I was
constrained I say, to returne to <HI>Tockai</HI> in the higher <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI>
and from thence in one day I stepped into <HI>Transil∣vania.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey is so environed with high and unpassa∣ble
mountaines about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of <HI>Transilva∣nia.</HI></NOTE> that their is but onely five entries
to come into it, which makes it so strong and impregna∣ble:
Within, there is a rich bottome or plaine of thirty
miles long, and sixe broad, being beautified with sixe faire
Townes; the chiefest whereof are <HI>Cromestate, Iuliastrad,</HI>
and <HI>Hermestat:</HI> the sides of the Mountaines within rise
all upward halfe levell way even to the tops, which ma∣keth
a pleasant and prospective Countrey, and the best
mixt soyle of <HI>Europe:</HI> For on the incircled plaine there
groweth nothing but Wheate, Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Barley, Pease, and
Beanes: And on the halfe, or lower parts of the Hills a∣bout,
nothing but Wines, and infinite Villages, and to∣ward
the extreame circulary heights, onely, Pastorage for
Kine, Sheepe, Goates, and Horses, and thickers of woods:
So fram'd that every one supplieth an other, for they of
the Valley furnish the other two parts with Victualls; and
they againe them with Wines, Bestiall, Butter, and
Cheese; each interchanging all necessary things with one
another as they neede. Here I found every where kind and
familiar people, yea, and the very Vulgar speaking fre∣quent
Latine, and so commonly doe all the <HI>Hungarians.</HI>
The Inhabitants here are all Protestants, but for their
<HI>Vayvod</HI> or Prince <HI>Bethlem Gabor,</HI> I saw him not, for hee
<PB N="417" REF="220"/>
was lying sick of a Feaver at <HI>Iuliastred:</HI> This Province is
a free Principality, &amp; notwithstanding adherent in some
respect to the authority of the <HI>Turke.</HI> But now having
left this religious Country, and crossing the North pas∣sage
of the Hills, called the <HI>Borean Berger,</HI> or north moun∣taine,
I entred in <HI>Moldavia;</HI> where for my welcome in the
midst of a border<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wood, I was beset with sixe murderers,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="418" REF="221"/>
<HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Moldavians:</HI> where having with many
prayers saved my life, they robbed me of three score <HI>Hun∣gar</HI>
Duckets of gold, and all my <HI>Turkish</HI> clothes, leaving
me stark naked; save onely they returned to me my Pa∣tents,
Papers, and Seals.</P>
<P>This done, and for their better secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itie, they carried
me a little out of the way, and bound my naked body fast
about the middle to an Oaken tree, with wooden ropes,
and my armes backward so likewise: swearing to mee,
that if I cried for help, or hindred them of their designes
before the Sun-set, they would turnback and kill me; pro∣mising
then to set me free.</P>
<P>But night come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A joyfull deli∣verance from a despe∣rate thral∣dome.</NOTE> and I forgotten, was left herein a
trembling feare, for Wolves and wild Boars, till the mor∣row;
were at last, by Gods providence, I was relieved in
the morning by a company of Heards: who clothing me
with an old long coat of theirs, and refreshing me with meat,
one of them carried me five leagues unto the Lord
of the ground, the Baron of <HI>Starholds</HI> a <HI>Moldavian</HI>
Protestant, with whom I stayed fifteene dayes: And wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
more than repaired of all my losses, by his owne boun∣ty,
and noble Kinsmen, his neigbouring friends, and
would not suffer mee to goe any further in the Countrey,
because of the <HI>Turkes</HI> jealousie over strangers, in regard
it was but lately wrested from a Christian Prince, with
whom I was conversant at <HI>Constantinople</HI> in Sir <HI>Thomas
Glover,</HI> the Ambassadors house.</P>
<P>Well, I yield to the Noble mans counsell, and gi∣ving
him all dutifull thanks for his kind regards, he sent
a guide with mee for two dayes journey through a part
of <HI>Podolia,</HI> the upmost Countrey of <HI>Polland,</HI> bordering
with <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P>The halfe of which Country, I found left disinhabited
<PB N="419" REF="221"/>
and desola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by incursions of <HI>Tartarians.</HI> Here I determi∣ned
to have entred <HI>Tartary,</HI> but finding no conduct
not assurance of my safety, I continued my course to
<HI>Crocavia;</HI> situa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the upper Frontiers of <HI>Polland</HI> bor∣dering
with <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tartary</HI> is thought to be six hundred leagues in length,
confining Eastward with <HI>China,</HI> to the South with the

with <HI>Podolia,</HI> and <HI>Muldavia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> are not expert in Warre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Tartars</HI> are mightie oppressors of <HI>Podolia</HI> in <HI>Polland.</HI></NOTE> neither are they
so valorous as the <HI>Turkes,</HI> not so manly as the <HI>Poloni∣ans,</HI>
who counter blow them at rancounters; never∣thelesse
by stealth of inroads, they mightily suppresse
the extreamest parts of <HI>Poland.</HI> The <HI>Turkes</HI> tearme the
<HI>Cham</HI> or Emperour of <HI>Tartary, Vlakim,</HI> that is a great
Prince and the <HI>Moscovites</HI> call him <HI>Catzar Cataiskci,</HI>
to wit, the <HI>Caesar</HI> of <HI>Cataia:</HI> And hee is so obeyed and
reverenced among the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that they intitulate him
the Sonne of God, the man of God, and the foule of
God: yea, and the greatest Oath that they thinke can
bee sworne, which they usually doe in ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers of
fidelitie and great importance, is by his Throne
Royall.</P>
<P>This custome of idolatrous obeysance came first by
one <HI>Rangavistah,</HI> who being chosen to be their Emperor,
would try their promptnesse and good will of obedience
towards him, commanding seven of his chiefest Prin∣ces,
and head Governours under him of the people, to
to kill their infants, with their own hands.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmandement seemed
verie rude and intolerable, yet they fearing the common
people, who esteeme their Emperours to be the divine
Kinsmen (as it were) of God; they did cut the throats
<PB N="420" REF="222"/>
every one of them, of their owne Children, before his
owne eyes, and the sight of the people.</P>
<P>Insomuch, that ever since, the life and death of the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
depend upon the good-will, and word of the King,
which no way they dare contradict; such is the ignorant
reverence they carry toward him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartarians,</HI> for the most part are small of body,
their eyes grosse, and bolstring out, their faces bee broad
and without haire, saving that in their upper Lippe and
Chin, they have thinne and moist haire; they bee com∣monly
slender in the middle; they shave their heads
from one eare to the other, by the top of the Crowne
to the hinder part, keeping long haire like unto a wo∣man,
whereof they make two folds or pleats, and so
binde them both behind the eares; and so bee all other
shaven that live amongst them. They be excellent horse∣men,
and ill foote-men; and therefore none goeth a foot,
but rides either on horse-back, or upon some other beast,
as Oxen, or Cowes. They take great pride to hang Bells
and other Tassells of silke about their horses necks, to
make them shew comely, and a meanes because of their
Bells, to keepe them from tyring, being hung at their
eares: When they drinke, they powre it in till they bee
drunken, which they take as a great glory or Conquest a∣mong
them, who can carry most drinke; a custome too
much used here in <HI>England,</HI> which I could wish were left;
For the glory of a drunkard is his owne shame. They
have no bread, nor use any baking, nor Table-cloaths,
nor Towells; they use no handkerchiefs, nor seldome or
never doe they wash their hands, body, or aparrell. They
eate no pot-hearbes, nor pulfe; but onely the flesh of all
kind of living things, not caring whether cleane or un∣cleane
creatures, as dogges, horses, &amp;c. They roast the
<PB N="421" REF="222"/>
bodies of such parties as they take in warre, to shew
their cruelty, and desire of revenge: And where many
meet together in the eating of them, they teare them
with their teeth like Wolves, and drinke their blood,
which they reserved before in Cups, otherwise they drink
Cowes Milke.</P>
<P>It is a hainous thing with them to suffer any drinke to
be lost, or any meate cast away; and therefore they cast no
bones to Dogs, before they have broken the bones and
taken out the Marrow. In warre they have swords of a
yard long: their horse-men are very skilfull in discharg∣ing
their Pistolls. Their Princes never enter into warre,
but standing afarre off, they call unto their owne compa∣ny,
to be of good courage, and exhort them to bee reso∣lute,
and fight manfully. They most commonly carry
their wives and children with them, because their wives
are attired like men: they also carry Images of men on
Horse-backe to their warres, which they thinke is a point
of policy, that they may seeme a great number, and to
dis-hearten their enemies. They count it no dishonour
or shame to runne away from their enemies, if they finde
themselves to be too weake for them. And if they do get
the victory, they spare none, neither women nor children,
young, nor old: They give quarter to none, but onely to
those who are Artificers, and handy-crafts men, whom
they reserve for their owne uses: They are very inconti∣nent,
and therefore they are suffered to take as many
wives as they please; they except none, neither mother,
daughter, or sister, and they are given much to <HI>Sodomy.</HI>
They do not esteem of any other womē as of their wives,
nor doe they thinke her worthy of any Dowry, before
that she hath brought forth a child: They may refuse any
wife which they have, if they bee barren, and may take
<PB N="422" REF="223"/>
another. They that are taken in the act of Adultry, are
surely put to death by their Law, having no pitty shewed
them. No man maketh water in his house, if he doth,
he is sure to be slaine: if necessity compeld him, that hee
could not stay, then his Tent and other things therein, are
purified and aired with fire, and other curious scen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>
<P>When they chuse and elect their Prince, they meet to∣gether
in a large field, and then they set him a stately
Throne richly guilded, placed in the view of all that are
then present, and falling downe before him, they pro∣claime
all after this sort, and with one consent. <HI>Wee be∣seech,
we will, and command, that thou beare rule over us.</HI>
Then their new King which is chosen answereth: <HI>If you
will have this done of me, it is necessary, that you be ready
to doe all that I shall command you: When I call▪ to come:
and wheresoever I send, to goe: and to commit and put the
whale rule into our hands:</HI> when they have answered, <HI>Wee
be ready;</HI> he saith againe, <HI>Therefore my word shall bee my
sword;</HI> then all the people clap their hands with great re∣joycing.
Then the Noble men take him from the Regall
Seat, and make him to sit softly upon a Cushion, or Car∣pet
upon the ground, saying thus: <HI>Looke up, and acknow∣ledge
God; and looke downeward to the Cushion whereon
thou fittest: if thou dost governe and rule well, thou shalt
have all things according to thy de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire: But if thou dost ill,
thou shalt be brought so low and so bare, that this small Cushi∣on
whereon thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itest, shall not be left thee.</HI> At which say∣ing,
they adjoyne unto him his dearest and best beloved
wife, and lifting them both up with the Cushion, they
salute them as their Emperour and head.</P>
<P>Then to such as be present at this Ceremony, of other
Nations, he commandeth gifts to be given them out of
hand: there is also all the treasure and jewells which the
<PB N="423" REF="223"/>
late deceased Emperour left, wherewith this new Empe∣rour
rewardeth every Noble man; and that which remai∣neth
he commandeth to be kept for his owne use. The
Seale that hee useth to seale with hath these words ingra∣uen
about it: <HI>God in heaven; and Chuithuth Cham on the
Land; the strength of God in heaven, and the Emperour of
men on earth.</HI> He himselfe speakes not to strange Em∣bassadors,
nor come they at any time in his sight, except
they, and their presents which they bring with them, have
bin first aired certaine daies. He giveth his answer by some
of his meanest Noble men, to whom, when, and how long
soever he speaketh, they ought to give eare upon their
knees bowed, and so attend; and they that deliver the
Emperours minde, dare not erre so much as in a word.</P>
<P>As for the idolatrous Rites they use at his death, in in∣closing
or interring quicke in a Vault neare to his Tomb,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A love not worthy things</NOTE>
one of every Office that he loved best, being alive, to goe

of <HI>Poland</HI> (though of small importance) I met with di∣vers
<HI>Scottish</HI> Merchants, who were wonderfull glad of
mine arrivall there, especially the two brothers <HI>Dicksons,</HI>
men of singular note for honesty and wealth. It was my
luck here, to be acquainted with Count <HI>du Torne,</HI> the first
Noble man of <HI>Boheme,</HI> who had newly broke out of
prison in <HI>Prage,</HI> and fled hither for safety, <HI>Matthias</HI>
then being Emperour, against whom he had mightily of∣fended,

and before his wife the Empresse: Loe, there is the right
hand that helped to put the Imperiall Crowne on thy
head, &amp; behold now there is my foot shall strike it off a∣gain.
This fugitive Earle stayed me with him ten dayes,
to discourse and beare him company, for then hee had
but onely one follower that came post with him: I found
him Princely disposed in all things, and very familiar in
his carriage: At last his train and treasure comming with
many more <HI>Bohemian</HI> Barons, and Gentlemen his friends,
I humbly left him, and touching at <HI>Lubilina,</HI> where the
Judges of <HI>Poland</HI> sit for halfe the yeare, I arrived at <HI>War∣sow,</HI>
the resident place for the King <HI>Sigismond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This <HI>Sigis∣mond</HI> King of <HI>Poland</HI> did marry two si∣sters of <HI>Ferdi∣nandos</HI> now <HI>Emperour.</HI></NOTE> who had

<P>But it is no matter, Pope <HI>Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Quintus</HI> gave him li∣cence,

Here I found aboundance of gallant rich Merchants my
Country-men, who were all very kinde to me, and so
were they by the way in every place where I came; the
conclusion being ever sealed with deep draughts, and
God be with you.</P>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> is a large and mighty Kingdome, puissant in
Horse-men, and populous of strangers; being charged
with a proud Nobility, a familiar and manly gentry, and
a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vidous vulgarity: They are all, for the most part,
of square and thicke bodies, having Bull-necks, great
<PB N="425" REF="224"/>
thighes and legs, grim, and broad faces, and commonly
their shaven heads are finely covered with overthwarting
strokes of crooked Shables: for they, and the <HI>Armenians</HI>
of <HI>Asia</HI> are of stature and thicknesse the biggest and gros∣sest
people the world affordeth.</P>
<P>The foile is wonderfull fruitfull of Cornes, so that
this Country is become the most fruitfulst place of We∣sterne
<HI>Europe,</HI> for all sorts of graine, besides Honey, Wax,
Flax, Iron, and other commodities; And for auspicuous∣nesse,
I may rather terme it to be a Mother and Nurse, for
the youths, and younglins of <HI>Scotland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poland</HI> is the Nurse of <HI>Scot∣lands</HI> young∣lins.</NOTE> who are yearely
sent hither in great numbers, than a proper Dame for her
owne birth; in cloathing, feeding, and inriching them
with the fatnesse of her best things; besides thirty thou∣sand
<HI>Scots</HI> families, that live incorporate in her Bowells.
And certainly <HI>Poland</HI> may bee termed in this kind to bee
the mother of our Commons, and the first commence∣ment

part of them.</P>
<P>And now ceasing to peramble through any more par∣ticulars
of this familiar Nation to us, I was kindly trans∣ported
from <HI>Warsow</HI> upon a Waggon to <HI>Dansicke,</HI> being
fifty Leagues distant, with a generous young Merchant

<P>Here in <HI>Dansick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> I fell deadly sicke for three Weeks
space, insomuch that my grave and Tombe was prepared
by my Country-men there.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse, in end (it pleased Almighty God) I re∣covered
my health, and then imbarked for <HI>Alseynure</HI> in
<HI>Denmarke,</HI> where being better convalessed, I recour∣sed
backe in a <HI>Flemish</HI> Pink to <HI>Stockhollem:</HI> where, after
five or sixe dayes being there, and finding my sicknesse

like to returne againe, and fearing the worst, I made haste
for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>At last finding the opportunity of an <HI>English</HI> ship belon∣ging
to <HI>Ratcliffe,</HI> we hoysed saile, &amp; set forward through
the Sound or <HI>Beltick</HI> Sea, for <HI>Alseynvere</HI> againe: Whence,
after three dayes abode, bidding farewell to that Town
and Castle, we coasted the scurrile and rocky face of <HI>Nor∣way,</HI>
at two severall parts, but not without great stormes,
and contrary winds; yea, and once finally indangered
with a threatning Shipwracke, which with good luck we
happily escaped.</P>
<P>These tempestuous dangers past, upon the seventh day
the windes favouring us, we safely arrived at <HI>London,</HI>

of my first and second Adventures; it
rest n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w most necessary, to relate the Meri∣torious
designe, and miserable effect of
my third Voyage. After I had (I say) by
the great providence of God, escaped infinite dangers by
Seas, suffering thrice shipwrack: by Land, in Woods, and
on Mountaines often invaded; by ravenous Beasts, craw∣ling
and venemous Wormes daily incombred; by home∣bred
Robbers, and remote Savages five times strip'd to
the skin; excessive fastidiousnesse, unspeakable adversities,
parching heats, scorching drouth, intollerable distresses
of hunger, imprisonments, and cold; yet all these almost
incredible sufferings past, could never abate the flame of
mine austiere affection conceived; but ambitious curiosi∣ty,
exposing me to a third Voyage, I may say as <HI>Aene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
did in his penetentiall Mood:
<Q><L>O socij neque eni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i ignari sumus, ante malorum,</L>

<L>O suffrings sad, God too, will end these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rosses.</L></Q></P>
<P>But to observe a methodicall order, I thinke it best to
shew the unacquainted Reader, a reasonable satisfaction
for undertaking the third, and almost invincible at∣tempt</P>
<P>First, the most speciall and urgent cause, proceeded
from a necessary good (the necessity of knowledge) in
the requisite perfection of <HI>Europes</HI> full and spacious
sight, the ancient Tierce, and now most Christian world;
wanting former no part thereof unseene, as well under
the Turke as Christian, except <HI>Ireland</HI> and the ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe of

<P>The second cause was moved from a more in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atiate
content,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certaine ap∣proved rea∣sons.</NOTE> that when I had, and having compassed all <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
my resolution was to borrow a larger dimmense
of ground in <HI>Affricke</HI> than formerly I had done in twice
before, even to <HI>Aethiopia▪ Prester▪ Iehans</HI> Dominions.
For the same effect, and a great impression to my Reso∣lution,
I set pen to paper, drawing from the distaffe of
the retractable Muses, a Poeticall pamphlet; Dedicated
to themselves, to their profound <HI>Apollo,</HI> his then
hopefull Heire, and divers Noble Peeres of both King∣domes.</P>
<P>And having from a Royall favour obtained his Maje∣sties
Letters and Seales of safe Conduct, and Regall re∣commendation
to all Kings, Princes, and Dukes, &amp;c. I
in all obsequious humility bad farewel to this sequestrate
and most auspicuous Monarchy; and arriving at <HI>Dub∣lin</HI>
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the two and twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> one
thousand sixe hundred and nineteene, I saluted the right
Honourable Sir <HI>Oliver</HI> St. <HI>Iohns</HI> late Lord <HI>Grandison,</HI> and

then Lord Deputy there, from whom for regard and
singular courtesies, I was greatly obliged: So was I also

who through the whole Countrey where ever I came en∣tertained
mee kindly, sending Guides with mee from

late Lord <HI>Chichester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The match∣lesse Lord of <HI>Chichester</HI> for vertue, wis∣dome, and valour.</NOTE> Baron of <HI>Belfast,</HI> &amp;c. Who in his

of Love, and Garland of true Noblenesse: Of
whom, and for whose losse, if I should more praise, and

<P>And now after a generall surveigh of the whole King∣dome,
(the North-west part of <HI>Canoch</HI> excepted) accom∣plished:
from the first of <HI>September</HI> til the last of <HI>February;</HI>
<PB N="431" REF="227"/>
I found the goodnesse of the Soyle, more then answera∣ble
to mine expectation, the defect only remayning (not
speaking of our Colonies) in the people, and from them,
in the bosome of two gracelesse Sisters, Ignorance and
Sluggishnesse.</P>
<P>This Kingdom is divided in foure provinces, although
some allude five, that is, Easterne and Westerne <HI>Maith,</HI>
but they are understood to be annexed to <HI>Leinster:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The foure Provinces of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> Their
names are these, <HI>Leinster, Munster, Vlster,</HI> and <HI>Canocht:</HI>
The South-most whereof, is <HI>Munster</HI> a foile (and so is
<HI>Leinster</HI> in most parts (nothing inferiour, if seasonably
manured, to the best grounds in <HI>England.</HI> The Island
lieth almost in a Rotundo, being every way spacious;
the greatest River whereof is <HI>Shannon,</HI> whose course, a∣mounteth
to eight score miles, inclosing within it many
little Isles.</P>
<P>And this I dare avo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, there are more Rivers, Lakes,
Brooks, Strands, Quagmires, Bogs and Marishes, in
this Countrey, then in all Christendome besides; for
Travelling there in the Winter, all my daily solace, was
sincke downe comfort; whiles Boggy-plunging deeps
kissing my Horse-belly; whiles over mired Saddle, Bodie,
and all; and often or ever set a swimming in great dan∣ger
both I and my Guides of our Lives: That for clou∣dy
and fountaine-bred perils, I was never before reduct∣ed
to such a sloting Laborinth. Considering that in five
months space, I quite spoiled six horses, and my selfe as
tyred as the worst of them.</P>
<P>And now I call to memory (not without derision)
though I conceal the particular place and prelate, it was
my Fortune in the County of <HI>Dunagale,</HI> to bee joviall
with a bishop at his Table, whereafter diverse Discour∣ses,
my ghostly Father grew offended with mee, for
<PB N="429" REF="228"/>
terming of his wife Mistresse: which when understood,
I both called her Madam, and Lady Bishop: Whereupon
he grew more incensed; and leaving him unsatisfied: re∣solve
me Reader, if it be the custome here or not? an di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣amends
shall repay over-sight, a ghostly wife shall be still
Madam Lady with me; if not, mine observed manner
shall be Mistresse.</P>
<P>But now to come to my punctuall Discourse of <HI>Ire∣land;</HI>
true it is, to make a fit comparison, the <HI>Barbarian</HI>
Moore, the Moorish <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the <HI>Turke,</HI> and the <HI>I∣rish-man,</HI>
are the least industrious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ignorant and sluggish life of the common <HI>Irish</HI></NOTE> and most sluggish li∣vers
under the Sunne, for the vulgar <HI>Irish,</HI> I protest, live
more miserably in their brutish fashion, than the un∣daunted,
or untamed <HI>Arabian,</HI> the Devillish-idolatrous
<HI>Turcoman,</HI> or the Moone-worshipping <HI>Caramines,</HI> shew∣ing
thereby a greater necessity they have to live, than any
pleasure they have, or can have in their living.</P>
<P>Their Fabricks are advanced three or foure yards
high, Pavilion-like incircling, erected in a singular
Frame, of smoak-torne straw, greene long prick'd
turffe, and Rain-dropping watles. Their severall Rooms
of Palatiat divisions, as Chambers, Halls, Parlours, Kitch∣ins,
Barnes, and Stables, are all inclosed in one, and
that one (perhaps) in the midst of a Mire; where, when
in foule weather, scarcely can they finde a drye part,
whereupon to repose their cloud-baptized heads. Their
shirts be woven of the wooll or Linnen of their owne na∣ture,
and their penurious food semblable to their ruvid
condition.</P>
<P>And lastly, these onely titular Christians, are so igno∣rant
in their superstitious profession of Popery, that nei∣ther
they, nor the greatest part of their Priests know, or
understand what the mystery of the Masse is; which
<PB N="433" REF="228"/>
they daily see, and the other celebrate, nor what the name
of <HI>Iesus</HI> is, either in his divine or humane Nature: Aske
him of his Religion, he replieth; what his father, his great
Grandfather were, that will he be also: And hundreds
of better than the commot sort, have demanded mee, if
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and Christs Sepulchre were in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and if
the <HI>Holy Land</HI> was contiguat with Saint <HI>Patricks</HI> Purga∣tory.</P>
<P>They also at the sight of each New Moone, (I speak
it credibly) bequeath their Cattell to her protection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A foolish and superstitious errour.</NOTE>
obnoxiously imploring the pale Lady of the Night, that
she will leave their Beastiall in as good plight as shee
found them: And if sicke, scabbed, or sore, they solici∣tate
her Maiden-fac'd Majesty to restore them to their
health, in which absurdity they farre surmount <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he silly
<HI>Sabuncks,</HI> and <HI>Garolinean Moores</HI> of <HI>Lybia:</HI> Indeed
of all things, (besides their ignorance) I onely lamented
their heavie bondage under three kind of Masters; the
Land-lord for his rent, the Minister for his tythes, and the
<HI>Romish</HI> Priest for his fees: And remarke when their own
<HI>Irish</HI> Rent-masters have any voyage for <HI>Dublin,</HI> or per∣adventure
superspended at home in feasting of strangers;
then must these poore ones be taxed and afflicted with the
supply of the devasted provision of their prodigal houses;
otherwise in supporting their superfluous charges for
<HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>O! what a slavish servitude doe these silly wretches
endure? the most part of whom in all their lives, have ne∣ver
a third part of food, natures cloathing, nor a secure
shelter for the winter cold.</P>
<P>The miserable sight whereof, and their sad sounding
groanes, have often drawne a sorrowfull remorse from
my humane compassion.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="229"/>
As for their Gentry, such as are brought up here at
<HI>London,</HI> learne to become a great deale more civill, than
those who are brought up at home after their owne
rude and accustomed manner: And this I observed,
in my traversing the whole Kingdome I never saw one or
other, neither could moove any of that selfe Nation, to
pledg or to present his Majesties health; but as many other
healths as you list; they will both fasten and receive from
you, till they fall in the muddy hotch potch of their dead
Grand-fathers understanding: indeed for intertainement
of strangers they are freely disposed: and their Gentle∣men
of any good sort reserve ever in their houses, <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Sack, and <HI>Irish Vscova,</HI> and will bee as tipsy with
their wives, their Priests, and their friends, as though
they were naturally infeft in the eleven royall Taverns of
<HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>And now amongst many, there are two intolerable
abuses of protections in that Kingdome:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two intole∣rable abuses in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> The one of
Theeves and Wood-carnes, the other of Priests and Pa∣pists:
I discourse of these corruptions now as I found
them then.</P>
<P>The first is prejudicall to all Christian civilnesse, tran∣quill
government, and a great discouragement for our
colloniz'd plantators there, belonging to both soyles of
this Island; being daily molested, and nightly incombered
with these blood-sucking Rebells.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding of their barbarous cruelty, ever
executed at all advantages, with slaughter and murder
upon the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>English</HI> dwellers there; yet they have
and find at their owne wills Symonicall protections,
for lesser or longer times; ever as the confused dispo∣sers,
have their law-sold hands, filled with the bloody
bribes of slaughtered lives, high-way, and house
<PB N="435" REF="229"/>
robbed people: And then thereafter their ill got meanes
being spent, like unto dogs, they returne back to their
former vomit; so jugling with their in, and outgoings,
like to the restlesse Ocean, that they cannot nor never did
become true subjects to our King, not faithfull friends
to their Country: Unlesse by extremity of Justice, the
one still hanged before the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The filthy corruption of <HI>Irish</HI> Priests and Wood-Carns, thie∣vish Rebels.</NOTE> the remnant by the
gallowes may examplify amendment, contrariwise, that
Land shall never be quiet: for these villanous Wood∣carnes
are but the Hounds of their hunting Priests a∣gainst
what faction soever, their malicious malignity is
intended: partly for intertainement, partly for par∣ticular
spleens, and lastly, for a generall disturbance of the
Countrey, for the Priests greater security and stay.</P>
<P>The other abuse is, their Libertinous Masses; the re∣dresse
whereof, I first to the Heavens, and then to my
Prince bequeath; whose Sabboth recusant mony, where∣of
they bragge (as they say) in derision of our luke∣warme
dispensation, tendeth to none other purpose, but
to obombrate the true light of the Gospell, and to feed
their absurd, and almost irrevocable ignorance.</P>
<P>And neverthelesse at their daily meetings (experi∣ence
taught mee) there was never a more repining peo∣ple
against our Prince and Church as they be: for in this
presumption twofold cause arriseth, want of zeale and
Church discipline in our parts and the officious nine
penny Masse on their part: yea, all and each of them, so
exacted and compounded with a higher or lower rates,
as the officers in this nature please.</P>
<P>The distribution whereof, I no wayes paralell to the
sleight concavi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting veynes of the earth, nor the sole sup∣ply
of high-rising <HI>Atlas,</HI> neither to invelope the perpen∣diculars

Churches, unpassable bridges, indigent Schol∣lers,
and distressed families be supported therewith, I am
as cleare of it as they, although I smart by the contrary
confusion.</P>
<P>But leaving this, and observing my Method, I remem∣ber
I saw in <HI>Irelands</HI> North-parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad &amp; un∣civill Husban∣dry in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> two remarkable sights▪
The one was their manner of Tillage, Ploughes drawne
by Horse-tayles, wanting harnesse, they are onely fastned
with straw, or wooden Ropes to their bare Rumps, mar∣ching
all side for side, three or foure in a ranke, and as ma∣ny
men hanging by the ends of that untoward Labour. It
is as bad a husbandry, I say, as ever I found among the
wildest Savages alive; for the <HI>Caramins,</HI> who understand
not the civill forme of Agriculture, yet they delve, hol∣low,
and turn over the ground with manuall and wooden
instruments: But they the <HI>Irish,</HI> have thousands of both

<P><PB N="437" REF="230"/>
<HI>Ireland</HI> is an excellent Country to live in for cheapnes
and all variety of mans sustenance: therefore I would in∣treat
the Reader to take this description of it, (though
already spoken of before, but not so fully.)</P>
<P>This Country of <HI>Ireland</HI> lyeth farre in the West Oce∣an,
and is accounted by the most expert in that kinde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The length of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE>
to be in length very neare three hundred Miles, from
North to South: in bredth, from East to West, one
hundred and twenty Miles: It much resembleth the
forme of an Egge; being as it were blunt at each end,
and smooth or plaine on the sides; not extending it
selfe forth to sea in Nooks and Armes of Land, as <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
doth.</P>
<P>The Country it selfe lyeth low, and is very waterish,
And containeth in it divers little Islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the Coun∣try.</NOTE> and is much
troubled with Bogs and Marishes. Some of their high∣est
Hills, I have seene them had standing pooles of wa∣ter
on their tops; the Country of it selfe is very fruitfull
in all sorts of Cattell, and very plentifull of all manner
of graine: The aire is very wholsome, yet not altoge∣ther
so cleare and subtle as <HI>England.</HI> The inhabitants are
much troubled with sicknesse, as defluxion of Rhumes,
and bloody Flixes; and for prevention and helpe there∣of
they drinke <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> which they conceive doth
dry up the Rhume, and keepe them healthfull: It hath
beene very full of Wood, and but little Champaigne
ground: It is mightily inhabited by our <HI>English,</HI> and
much civilized of late, by the great care of those which
are and have beene their Governours.</P>
<P>Sea-coale and Turffe is most of their fuell; it hath
great store of horses, but of no great stature, as they bee
in <HI>England:</HI> They have plenty of Fish and all manner of
Fowle: Great store of Bees, which yields them no small
<PB N="438" REF="231"/>
profit: Sheepe are the fewest and scarcest of all other
Cattell, and those are but small, and yield very course
Woole, whereof the women spinne and make their
Rugges and Mantles, which they weare about them.
No Venemous or Creeping Beast is bred, brought
forth, or nourished there, nor can live there if it were
sent in; and therefore the Spider of <HI>Ireland</HI> is well known
not to be venemous or hurtfull.</P>
<P>The most part of the better sort of people are inclined
to vertue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the people.</NOTE> and Religion; wondrous kinde, amorous, and
loving, where they take their first love; but very revenge∣full
and spleenfull otherwise. There are many Sorcerers
and Witches amongst this Nation. The gentlemen are
excellent horse-men; delighted with exercise of warlike
Armes, and are both stout and couragious; and very
free and bountifull in their Almes, and hospitality. At
the death of any friend or kindred, they follow the dead
corpes to the Grave with howlings and bitter cryings;
pittifull in outward shew. They are very apt to believe
and give credit to Miracles and old Prophesies, Rela∣tions
and foolish sayings. They are very desirous of
praise and honour; but very fearefull of dishonour.
They love an excellent Poet, who can or will extoll
Saint <HI>Patricke</HI> and their owne Nation, and will bounti∣full
reward them.</P>
<P>As for any other customes they have, to avoid pro∣lixitie
I spare; onely, before my pen flee over Seas, I
would gladly shake hands with some of our Church∣men
there, for better are the wounds of a friend, than
the sweet smiles of a flatterer, for love and truth cannot
dissemble.</P>
<P>Many dissembling impudents intrude themselves in
this high calling of God, who are not truly, neither
<PB N="439" REF="231"/>
worthily thereunto called, the ground here arising either
from a carnall or carelesse presumption, otherwise from
needy greed, and lack of bodily maintenance.</P>
<P>Such is now the corruption of time, that I know here
even Mechanick men admitted in the place of Pastors:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ecclesia∣stick corrup∣tion in un∣lawfull Prea∣chers.</NOTE>
yea, and rude bred Souldiers, whose education was at
the Musket mouth, are become there, both <HI>Lybian</HI>
grave, and unlearned Churchmen: Nay; besides them
professed; indeed professed Schollers: whose warbling
mouthes ingorged with spoonefu's of bruised Latine,
seldome or never expressed, unlesse the force of quaffing,
spew it out forth from their empty Sculs: Such I say,
interclude their Doctrine, betweene the Thatch and
the Church-wall tops; and yet their smallest stipends
shall amount to one, two, three, or foure hundred pounds
a yeare.</P>
<P>Whereupon you may demand mee, how spend they, or
how deserve they this? I answer, their deserts are nought,
and the fruit thereof as naughtily spent: for Sermons and
Prayers they never have any, neither never preached any,
nor can preach.</P>
<P>And although some could, as perhaps they seeme∣ing
would, they shall have no Auditour (as they say)
but bare Walles, the plants of their Parishes, being
the rootes of meere <HI>Irish.</HI> As concerning their carri∣age,
in spending such sacrilegious Fees, the course is
thus.</P>
<P>The Alehouse is their Church, the <HI>Irish</HI> Priests their
Consorts, their Auditors be Fill, and Fetch more, their
Text <HI>Spanish</HI> Sacke, their Prayers carrousing, their
singing of Psalmes the whiffing of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> their
last blessing <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and all their Doctrine sound drun∣kennesse.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="232"/>
And whensoever these parties meet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A flattering covenant twixt Mini∣sters and Masse Priests.</NOTE> their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting is
<HI>Dane</HI>-like from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pot, and the Minister still
Purse-bearer, defrayeth all charges for the Priest: Ar∣guments
of Religion, like <HI>Podolian Polonians</HI> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uc∣cumbe;
their conference onely pleading mutuall for∣bearance;
the Minister affraid of the Priests Wood-Carnes,
and the Priests as fearefull of the Ministers
apprehending, or denoting them; contracting thereby
a <HI>Gibeonized</HI> covenant, yea, and for more submissions
sake, hee will give way to the Priest to mumble Masse in
his Church, where he in all his life made never Prayer nor
Sermon.</P>
<P>Loe, there are some of the abuses of our late weak, and
stragling Ecclesiasticks there, and the soule-sunk sorrow
of godlesse Epicures and Hypocrites.</P>
<P>To all which, and much more have I beene an occular
Testator, and sometimes a constrayned consociate to
their companionry, yet not so much inforced as desi∣rous
to know the behaviour and conversation of such
mercenary <HI>Iebusites.</HI></P>
<P>Great God amend it, for it is great pitty to behold
it, and if it continue so still, as when I saw them last;
O farre better it were! that these ill bestowed Tythes,
and Church-wall Rents were distributed to the poore,
and needy, than to suffocate the swine-fed bellies of such
idle and prophane <HI>Parasites.</HI></P>
<P>And here another generall abuse, I observed that
whensoever any <HI>Irish</HI> dye, the friends of the defunct (be∣sides
other fees) paying twenty shillings to the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Curat, shall get the corpes of the deceased to bee
buried within the Church, yea often, even under
the Pulpit foote: And for lucre interre in Gods San∣ctuary
when dead, who when alive would never ap∣proach,
<PB N="441" REF="232"/>
one enter the gates of <HI>Sion;</HI> to worship the Lord,
nor conforme themselves to true Religion.</P>
<P>Truely such and the like abuses, and evill examples
of lewd lives, having beene the greatest hinderance of
that lands conversion; for such like wolues have beene
from time to time, but stumbling blocks before them;
regarding more their owne sensuall and licentious ends,
than the glory of God, in converting of one foule unto
his Church.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the conscionable carriage of the
<HI>Hybernian</HI> Cleargie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ministeriall officer strange∣ly abused.</NOTE> aske mee, and there my reply:
As many of them (for the most part) as are Protestant
Ministers, have their Wives, Children, and Servants, in∣vested
Papists; and many of these Church-men at the
houre of their death (like Dogs) returne backe to their
former vomit: Witnesse the late Vicar of <HI>Calin,</HI> (be∣longing
to the late and last, <HI>Richard</HI> Earle of <HI>Desmond,</HI>
who being on death-bed, and having two hundred
pounds a yeare; finding himselfe to forsake both life
and stipend, send straight for a Romish Priest, and
received the Papall Sacrament: Confessing freely in my
audience, that hee had beene a Roman Catholicke all
his life, dissembling onely with his Religion, for the
better maintaining of his wife and children. And being
brought to his burial place, he was interted in the Church,
with the which he had played the Ruffian all his life; be∣ing
openly carried at mid-day with Jesuites, Priests, and
Friers of his owne Nation, and after a contemptible
manner, in derision of our profession, and Laws of the
Kingdome.</P>
<P>Infinite more examples of this kinde could I recite, and
the like resemblances of some being alive; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut I respe∣ctively
suspend (wishing a Reformation of such Defor∣mation)
<PB N="442" REF="233"/>
and so concludeth this Cleargicall corruption
there. Yet I would not have the Reader to thinke, that <HI>I</HI>
condemne all our Cleargie there, no, God forbid, for
I know there are many sound and Religious Preachers of
both Kingdomes among them, who make conscience of
their calling, and live as <HI>Lanthornes,</HI> to uncapable Igno∣rants,
and to those stragling <HI>Stoicks</HI> I complain of, con∣demnatory
Judges; for it is a grievous thing to see in∣capable
men, to juggle with the high mysteries of mans
salvation.</P>
<P>And now after the fastidious ending of a tempestuous
Raine sacking toyle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My departure from <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> I imbarked at <HI>Yoghall</HI> in <HI>Munster,

Saint <HI>Mallo</HI> in <HI>Bretagne.</HI> Where, when transported, I set
face to <HI>Paris,</HI> where I found the Works of two scelerate

wrote against the life and Reigne of Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI>

the death of our late Queene <HI>Anne</HI> of ever blessed memo∣ry.
The circumstances whereof, I will not avouch, since

perfidiate pains.</P>
<P>A just reward (may I say) refounded, upon these fond

these superstitious straglers here; who, when,
they have sucked the Milke of their self-ends, and your

And there your meritorious thankes, and their

<P>Tell mee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fanta∣stick foolery of the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> if you be tied like Apes to imitate their e∣ver-changing

(in any Art or carriage) a greater draught, then they draw

<P>Besides these two infamous Authors, what hath <HI>Edee;</HI>
the <HI>Idea</HI> of a Knave, (and Gentleman of the <HI>French</HI>

and giddy headed Foole, (full of deficient Vapours) hath
shamefully stained with his shamelesse pen, the light of
this Kingdome, which now I omit to avouch till a fitter
time.</P>
<P>Thus, they fondly Write, thus they prattle, thus they
sing, thus they dance, thus they brangle, thus they dally in

conceit of sa, sa, sa, sa, sa, far beyond the inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstancie of
all female inconstancies.</P>
<P>But to conclude this Epitome of <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain cave∣ats for stran∣gers that goe to <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> three things I
wish Way-faring man to prevent there: First, the eat∣ing
of Victuals, and drinking of Wine without price
making; lest (when hee hath done) for the stridour of his
teeth his charges be redoubled. Next to choose his Lod∣ging
(if it fall out in any way-standing Tavern) far from
<PB N="444" REF="234"/>
palludiat Ditches, lest the vehemency of chirking Frogs,
vexe the wished for Repose of his fatigated body, and
cast him in a vigilant perplexity.</P>
<P>And lastly, unlesse early he would arise, I never wish
him to lye neere the fore-streetes of a Towne, because of
the disturbant clamours of the Peasant samboies or
nayle woodden shoes: whose noyse like an aequivox re∣sembleth
the clashing armour of <HI>Armies;</HI> or the clangour
of the <HI>Vlyssen</HI>-tumbling <HI>Horse</HI> to fatall <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>But now to my purpose, leaving <HI>Paris</HI> behinde mee, I
arrived at <HI>Pau</HI> in <HI>Bearne.</HI> This Province is a principality
of it selfe, anciently annexed to the Kingdom of <HI>Navarre:</HI>
lying between the higher <HI>Gascony</HI> of <HI>Guyan,</HI> and the <HI>Pyr∣henei</HI>
Mountaines of <HI>Baske,</HI> bordering with the North
parts of <HI>Navarre:</HI> Both of which, belongeth to the
<HI>French</HI> King, except a little of <HI>Baske</HI> toward the Colum∣bian
Alpes, and that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> commandeth.</P>
<P><HI>Pau</HI> is the Justice seate of <HI>Bearne,</HI> having a goodly Ca∣stle
situate on an artificiall Rock, and in this place was
that Martiall <HI>Henry du Burbone la Quatriesme</HI> borne, then
King of <HI>Navarre.</HI></P>
<P>Here be the finest Gardens in Christendome, the Gar∣dens
of <HI>Pretolino</HI> (5 miles from <HI>Florence</HI>) only excepted.
Yet for faire Arbors, spacious over-siling walkes, and
incorporate Trees interchanging growths, it surpasseth
<HI>Pretolino:</HI> but the other for the variety of fructiferous
Trees, rare and admirable ponds, artificiall fountaines;
<HI>Diana,</HI> and her Allablaster Nymphly-portrayed traine,
the counter-banding force of <HI>Aguadotti,</HI> and the exqui∣site
banqueting roome, contrived among sounding un∣seen
waters, in forme of <HI>Gargantus</HI> body, it much excel∣leth
<HI>Pau.</HI></P>
<P>Hence I discended the River of <HI>Orthes</HI> to <HI>Baion</HI> and
<PB REF="234"/>
<PB REF="235"/>
<PB N="447" REF="235"/>
crossing the River <HI>Behobia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Biscay</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> is a fer∣tile Country.</NOTE> which divideth <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Spaine,</HI> I entred in <HI>Biscai Iune</HI> 29 1620. This is a
Mountainous and invincible Countrey, (of which <HI>Victo∣nia</HI>
is the chiefe City) being a barren and almost unprofi∣table
Soile, the speciall commodities whereof, are
Sheepe, Wooll as soft as silk; Goats and excellent good
Iron: cornes they have none or little at all; neither wine
but what is brought from <HI>Navarre</HI> in <HI>Pelagoes</HI> or swine∣skins,
carried on Mulets backs.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Biscai,</HI> I entred <HI>Navarre</HI> and came to <HI>Pampe∣lona</HI>
its <HI>Metropolitan</HI> City: Heere I founde the poorest
<HI>Viceroy (nomen sinere</HI>) with the least meanes to maintaine
him that ever the World affoorded such a stile. <HI>Navarre</HI>
is but a little Kingdome, amounting in length (with the
South Pendicles of the high <HI>Perhenese</HI>) to twenty three
leagues: that is between <HI>Porto di St. Ioanne</HI> in <HI>Baske,</HI>
and <HI>Grono</HI> upon the River <HI>Hebro,</HI> dividing the old <HI>Casti∣lia</HI>
and <HI>Navarre.</HI> In breadth it extendeth to seventeene

in <HI>Arragon:</HI> The soyle is indifferent fertile of Corns and
Wines. From thence I set Eastward to <HI>Syragusa,</HI> the capi∣tall
Seat of <HI>Arragon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arragon,</HI> hath <HI>Navarre</HI> to the West; South, <HI>Valents</HI>
Kingdome; East, and South-East, <HI>Catalogna;</HI> and on the
North the <HI>Alpes Pyrhenese.</HI> It is an ancient and famous
Kingdome, under whose Jurisdiction were both the per∣ty
Kingdome of <HI>Valentia</HI> and <HI>Barselona:</HI> And not long
ago, traduced to the <HI>Castilian</HI> King by marriage. For al∣though
<HI>Castilia,</HI> hath the language, they have the lineall
dissent of the <HI>Romans;</HI> the inhabitants whereof, being in∣stinctively
endued with all humane affabilities. From
thence returning from the old <HI>Castilia,</HI> or Kingdome
of <HI>Burgos,</HI> in the way to St. <HI>Iago</HI> of <HI>Compostella</HI> in <HI>Galitia:</HI>
<PB N="448" REF="236"/>
It was my fortune, as St. <HI>Domingo</HI> to enter the Towne
Church accompanied with two <HI>French</HI> Puppies, mind∣full
to shew mee a miraculous matter.</P>
<P>Where when come, I espied over my head, opposit
to the great altar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lying mi∣racle.</NOTE> two milke white Henns, enraveled in
an iron Cage on the inner side of the Porches <HI>Promon∣tore.</HI>
And demanding why they were kept? Or what
they signified? Certaine <HI>Spaniards</HI> replyed; come along
with us, and you shall see the Storie, and being brought
to the (<HI>Choro</HI>) it was drawne thereon as followeth. The
father and the sonne, two <HI>Burboneons</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> going in
Pilgrimage to St. <HI>Iames,</HI> it was their lot to lodg here in
an Inne: Where supper ended, and reckoning payed, the
Host perceiving their denariat charge; hee entred their
Chamber when they were a sleepe, and in bed conveyi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g
his owne purse in the young mans Budget.</P>
<P>On the morrow early, the two innocent Pilgrims Foot∣ing
the hard brusing way, were quickly over hied by
the Justice, where the Host making search for his purse,
found it in the Sonnes bagge. Whereupon instantly
and in the same place hee was hanged, and left hang∣ing
there, seasing on their money by a sententiall for∣feiture.</P>
<P>The sorrowfull Father (notwithstanding) continued
his pilgrimage to <HI>Compostella,</HI> where, when come,
and devotion made, our Lady of mount <HI>Serata,</HI> appeared
to him saying: <HI>Thy Prayers are heard, and thy groanes
have pearced my heart, arise and returne to Saint</HI> Do∣mingo
<HI>for thy Sonne liveth.</HI> And hee accordingly re∣turned,
found it so, and the Sonne-hanged Monster,
after 30 dayes absence, spoke thus from the Gallowes,
<HI>Father, go to our Host, and shew him I live, then speedily
returne.</HI> By which direction the old man entred the
<PB N="449" REF="236"/>
Towne, and finding the Host at Table, in breaking up of
two roasted Pullets, told him and said: <HI>My sonne liveth,
come and see.</HI> To which the smiling Host replyed, he is as
surely alive on the Gallows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A damnable delusion of a devillish mi∣racle.</NOTE> as these two pullets be alive
in the dish. At which protestation, the two fire-scorched
fowles leapt out suddenly alive, with heads, wings, fea∣thers,
and feete, and cakling, took flight thrice about the
Table. The which amazing sight, made the astonished
Host to confesse his guiltines, and the other relieved from
the rope, he was hung up in his place, allotting his house
for an Hospitality to Pilgrimes for ever.</P>
<P>There are still two Henns reserved here, in memory
of this miracle, and are changed, as they grow fat for
the Priests chops, being freely given to the place. And
I dare swearing say, these Priests eate fatter Henns,
than <HI>Don Philippo</HI> himselfe, they being fed by the peo∣ples
devotion, at their enterance to the morning and eve∣ning
sacrifices, and are tearmed holy Henns. Infinite pa∣per
could I blot with relating the like absurdities, and mi∣raculous
lies of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, but leaving them till
a fitter occasion I proceed. From thence traversing,
a great part of the higher <HI>Asturia,</HI> I entred in <HI>Galitia,</HI>
and found the Country so barren, the people so poore,
and victuals so scarce, that this impoitunate inforcement,
withdrew me from S. <HI>Iacques,</HI> to <HI>Portugale:</HI> Where I
found little better, or lesser reliefe, their soyles being ab∣solute
sterile, desartuous, and mountainous.</P>
<P><HI>Portugale</HI> was formerly called <HI>Lusitania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The kingdom of <HI>Portugale.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Hispania
ulteriora:</HI> It is in length 320 miles, large 68, and some∣times
under: In the <HI>Moorish</HI> domination it was divided
in two Kingdoms, the one reserveth the name of all; the
other was called <HI>Agarbas:</HI> A word <HI>Arabick,</HI> that signifieth
the part Occidentall: And were divided with the River
<PB N="450" REF="237"/>
<HI>Guadion,</HI> and the two Castles <HI>Odebera,</HI> and <HI>Alcotino:
Agarbas</HI> was toward the South, and <HI>Portugale</HI> North∣ward.</P>
<P><HI>Portugale</HI> is now confined on the South, and South-east
with <HI>Andolusia:</HI> West and South-west, the maine Ocean.
<HI>Galitia</HI> to the North: And Eastward the old and new <HI>Ca∣stilia.</HI>
After twenty days fastidious climbing in this King∣dome,
I returned to <HI>Salamancha</HI> in <HI>Castilia, Vecchia;</HI> the
Sacerdotall Universitie of <HI>Spaine,</HI> whence springeth these
Flocks of <HI>Students,</HI> that over-swarme the whole Land
with Rogueries, Robberies, and Begging. From thence
traversing the <HI>Alps</HI> of <HI>Siera de Caderama,</HI> (which divide
the two <HI>Castiliaes</HI>) I descended the South side of the
Mountains, and arrived at the <HI>Escurial;</HI> where then late
King <HI>Philip</HI> the third, had his Residence.</P>
<P>This Palace standeth alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The palace of Escuriall.</NOTE> and founded upon the skirt
of a perpendicular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill of <HI>Caderama,</HI> squared out from
a devalling steepnesse, having a large prospect Southward∣ly
towards the <HI>Evenise</HI> Mountaines beyond <HI>Toledo.</HI> This

there is an high Turret erected above the coverture,
whose tops beare each of them a golden Globe. In the

Nay, at that instant, he was so private, that before
I saw his face, I could not believe, that the Patron of so

<P><HI>Spaine</HI> generally, is a masse of Mountaines, a bar∣ren

and commonly eight leagues without a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y house:

Provinces, or petty Kingdomes, hard lodging and poore,

your bed-lodging: Thus must the weary Stranger toile,

<P>The high-minded <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and their high-topped
Mountains have an infused contention together: The
one through arrogant ambition, would invade the whole
Earth to enlarge his Dominions: The other by a steepe
swolne height, seeme to threaten the Heavens, to pull
downe <HI>Iupiter</HI> from his Throne. And as I take it, the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> being of a low stature, borroweth his high-minded
breast from the high-topped Mountains, for the
one in quality, and the other in quantitie, be extraordi∣narily
infounded.</P>
<P>Certain it is, as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in all things standeth
maynly upon his Reputati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n (but never to avouch it
with single Combat) so hee vaunteth not a little of his
antiquitie, deriving his pedigree from <HI>Tubal,</HI> the Nephew
of <HI>Noe.</HI> But (especially as they draw it) how often hath
the Line of <HI>Tubal,</HI> beene bastarded, degenerated, and
quite expelled by invasions of <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> oppressions
of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> incursions of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> the
Conquest and planting of Provinces, and Colonies of

his owne Histories beare sufficient testimony and Record.
Then it is manifest, that this mixture of Nations,
must of necessity make a compounded Nature, such
as hauing affinitie with many, have no perfection in
any one.</P>
<P>Their Manners are conformable to their discent, and
their conditionall Vertues, semblable to their last and lon∣gest
Conquerours, of whom they retaine the truest
stampe.</P>
<P>The most penurious Peasants in the world be heere,
whose Quotidian moanes, might draw teares from
stones. There Villages stand as wast like as the <HI>Sabunck,
Garamont,</HI> or <HI>Arabian Pavillions,</HI> wanting Gardens,
Hedges, Closses, Barnes, or Backe-sides: This sluggish
and idle husbandry, being a naturall instinct of their
neighbour or paternall <HI>Moores.</HI></P>
<P>As for industrious Artes, inventions, and Vertues,
they are as dull thereof, as their late predecessors: and
truly I confesse, for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nun, shee is more holy
then the <HI>Italian;</HI> the former are onely reserved to the
<HI>Friers,</HI> and <HI>Priests:</HI> the latter being more noble, have
most affinity with Gentle-men. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> is of a
spare dyet and temperate, if at his owne cost hee spend;
but if given <HI>Gratis,</HI> he hath the longest <HI>Tusks</HI> that ever

<P>After a doubtfull and dangerous departure from
<HI>Madrid,</HI> (as Sir <HI>Walter Aston</HI> his Majesties Am∣bassadour
can testifie with his followers, as some of
his people have already here done the same,) being
<PB N="454" REF="239"/>
the drift of my owne Country-men, I came to <HI>To∣ledo,</HI>
twelve Leagues distant from thence: This Citie is
situate on a ragged Rocke upon the River <HI>Tagus,</HI> being
an Archbishops seat, the Primate and Metropolitan See
of all <HI>Spaine:</HI> Yet a miserably impoverished and defor∣med

<P>And although the <HI>Spaniard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naked condi∣tion conferred upon poore <HI>Toledo.</HI></NOTE> of all Townes in <HI>Spaine,</HI>

belongeth to it, amounting yearly (as they affirme)
to 200000 Duckats; for there is no other Episcopall
Seat in all <HI>Castilia;</HI> or Kingdome of <HI>Toledo.</HI> Giving back
to <HI>Toledo,</HI> I crossed the crossing <HI>Siera de Morada,</HI> (which
divideth the Kingdome of <HI>Grenada,</HI> from the <HI>Mansha</HI> of
the new <HI>Castilia</HI>) and arrived at <HI>Grenada,</HI> the Capitall of

<P>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re had the <HI>Moores</HI> their last Residence in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and
was magnanimously recovered, <HI>Anno</HI> 1499 yeares, by
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> the <HI>Castilian</HI> King, and his Wife <HI>Isabella.</HI> It
standeth at the foot of <HI>Siera de Nevada,</HI> (the Snowy
<HI>Alpes,</HI>) who reserve continually Snow on their tops, and
partly inclosed betweene two Snow-melting Rivers. In
this Citie is the principall Seate, &amp; Colledge of Iustice of
all South <HI>Spain:</HI> As <HI>Valladoli</HI> is for the North of <HI>Spain,</HI>
the high Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> having Prerogative over both.</P>
<P>It hath a spacious and strong Castle, which was
builded by the <HI>Moores,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d indeed a Kingly Mansion:
Where I saw the Halls and Bed-chambers of the <HI>Moorish</HI>
Kings, most exquisitely over-sieled, and indented with
Mosaicall worke; excelling farre any moderne industry
whatsoever.</P>
<P>The Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fift, and King of <HI>Spaine,</HI>
after his returne from that misfortunate Voyage of <HI>Al∣gier,</HI>
<PB N="455" REF="239"/>
left a monument here likely to have beene ac∣complished,
that is, the foundation of an admirable
work advanced two stories high, without it is quadrang∣led,
and within round; having two degrees of incircling
promontories supported by Marble pillars, and Alablaster
arches.</P>
<P>Being dismissed here, it was my fortune at <HI>Antecara</HI> to
encounter with a Merchant, (M. <HI>Woodson</HI> a Londoner,)
newly come from <HI>Venice,</HI> and bound to <HI>Malaga.</HI> With
whom desirously accompanied, the day following being
Sunday, with sore traveling wee came within night to
<HI>Malaga,</HI> and there after parting to our severall lodgings,
the next morning I addressed myselfe to the shoare side;
where I had notice given mee, of a French ship belong∣ing
to <HI>Tolon</HI> in <HI>Province,</HI> that was lying in the <HI>Mould,</HI>
and shortly bound for <HI>Alexandria:</HI> And finding that
Transportation most convenient for my designe (my sa∣fest
course lying through <HI>Aegypt</HI> and the Read Sea, for
<HI>Prester Iehans</HI> Dominions and Court) I presently made
bargaine with the Ships master, for my passage and Vi∣ctuals.</P>
<P>And now attending my departure thence, upon the
fift day after my comming hither <HI>Anno 1620 October</HI>
17 the English Fleete that went against the Pyrats of <HI>Al∣gier,</HI>
gave Anchor at mid-night in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he roade. Whose

Towne mistaking them for <HI>Turkes;</HI> for the
two Castle-hells Ringing back-ward, the thundring
Drums resounding and the Towne all the latter night in

and distraction to themselves, that their wives and chil∣dren
fled to the higher Castle, without the Towne; and

friends, and old Familiars, Londoners, and Courtiers,
with whom desirously met, wee were joviall together,
till Sunday morning: where then I went aboard of the
<HI>Lion,</HI> his Majesties ship, and saluted the Generall, who
kindly entertained mee to the next day that the Fleet
was divided in three Squaders, and he under sail, and then
unhappily came I ashoare in a Fisher-boat, to my deare
bought destruction, being sore against the Generals
will, but that I should have gone with him to <HI>Algier:</HI>
Save onely that my Linnen, Letters, and Packet was
lying in my Hostery, and so could not goe: but what

<P><PB N="457" REF="240"/>
I was no sooner entred the Towne, and drawing up
a private way to my lodging, to shun company and
acquaintance, for that night was I to have imbarked for
<HI>Alexandria,</HI> but I was suddenly surprised in that nar∣row
depopulated street with 9 <HI>Alguozilos,</HI> or Sergeants,
who inclosing me on both sides, laid violent hands on
me, wrapping mee up in a blacke frizado cloake, and
gripping my throat to stop my crying, they carried mee
on their armes to the governours house, and inclosed me
in a low Parlour.</P>
<P>To which when the Governour came,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sad request to a mercilesse Governour.</NOTE> for I was ac∣quainted
with him before, I sadly spoke, saying <HI>My most
noble Governour, and worthy Lord, I humbly beseech your
goodnesse to shew me for what offence or cause, I am thus vio∣lently
brought before you, knowing that in me, and from my
carriage there is no injury committed.</HI> Whereat, with∣out
answere and shaking his head, hee inclosed mee in a
little Cabinet within the parlour till he went to Masse,
commanding them with all possible dilligence to fetch
hither, the Captaine of the Towne, <HI>Don Francesco de
Cordava,</HI> the <HI>Alcademajor,</HI> and the States <HI>Scrivan,</HI> enjoy∣ning
them to conceale my apprehending till further tryal
under the paine of death.</P>
<P>At last hee from the Masse, and they come hither, the
Sergants were dismissed, the doores made fast, and I
was brought forth before these foure <HI>Cavallieros,</HI> all pla∣ced
in chaires, and the Scrivan-table set, with pen and
paper to write my Confession. Whereafter long silence,
the governour asked mee of my Nation, and how long,
and how often I had beene out of my Countrey, and
whether I was bound? and how long I had beene in
<HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>To whom I punctually returned my dividuat answers:
<PB N="458" REF="241"/>
Whereupon being inclosed in my former Cabinet, within
a while <HI>Don Francesco</HI> entred my Roome, demanding me
if I had been in <HI>Sivilia,</HI> or was come from it; and clapping
my cheeks with a <HI>Iudas</HI> smile, made this entreaty. <HI>My deare
brother, and gallant companion, confesse freely that you have
beene in</HI> Sivilia, <HI>for your countenance bewrayeth, there
are some hidden purposes in the closet of your brest, and</HI>
Para fuyr mas malo, <HI>you had best in time relate to mee the
truth.</HI></P>
<P>Whereat I saying no, as truth acquired, he went back,
resolving them of my stiffe deniall, and they therewith
incensed, I was invited to their former presence, and main
accusations ensuing. First, the Governour made me sweare
and hold up my hand, that I should tell the particular
truth of everything he was to demand of me; which in∣deed
I did according to my knowledge.</P>
<P>Then hee inquired if the <HI>English</HI> Generall, was a Duke,
or great Signior, and what could be the reason, that hee
refused to come ashoare there; for that was the first im∣pression
of their false conceived jealousie. Next; hee
asked mee, if I knew his name, and the other Captains
and what their names were? and what their intention
was? or if I had knowne of their comming abroad, or
preparation for it, before my departure from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Scrivan writing downe mean-while every word
hee spoke and what I answered: well; to all the former
particulars giving condigne satisfaction, and to the last,
denying that I knew of the forth comming of the Fleet,
they all foure gave a shout in the contrary. Whereupon
the Governour swearing, cursed and said, <HI>Thou lyest like
a Villain, thou art a Spie and a Traytor, and camest directly
from</HI> England <HI>of purpose to</HI> Spaine; <HI>and hath beene lying
nine moneths in</HI> Sivilia, <HI>getting sure intelligence, when
<PB N="459" REF="241"/>
the</HI> Spanish <HI>Navy was looked for from the</HI> Indies; <HI>and
that thou expresly here, came to meete with the</HI> English
Armado, <HI>(knowing of their drift) to give them credible
knowledge thereof: And that by thy information, they
might the more readily compasse their ends, and thus thy
treachery and subtilty, hath been imployed.</HI></P>
<P>Whereat I being astonished, and seriously answering
for the intention of the English Fleet, and my owne in∣nocencie
concerning them: Hee threatning said, I was
seene familiar a Board and a shoare, with the whole
Captaines, and knowne to be of their speciall acquain∣tance:
besides three hundred other Gentlemen, and Ma∣riners
with whom, and they with thee, were so in∣ward,
that it far exceeded the kindnesse of accidentall
meeting.</P>
<P>All this wee saw, and hourely remarked (said hee) and
thou art newly come from the Generall when thou wast
taken, where consulting with their Connsell of Warre
this morning, (concerning what they assigned thee to
accomplish) thou hast delivered thy opinion, and the ex∣pectation
of <HI>Sivilia,</HI> touching the return of his Majesties
<HI>Armado di Plato;</HI> and therefore thou art a <HI>Spiono,</HI> a Tray∣tour,
and a scelerate <HI>Velacco:</HI> for wee are not ignorant
(said he) of the burning of Saint <HI>Thome</HI> in the West <HI>In∣dies;</HI>
for there and then, wee had a certaine evidence of
the English infidelitie, and treacherous exploits in time
of Peace: Wherefore these <HI>Lutherans</HI> and sonnes of
the Devill, ought not from us, good Catholicks, to re∣ceive
no credit.</P>
<P>Whereupon I besought him, to send for some sufficient
English Factors, there sojourning, who would testifie the
contrary in my behalfe, their Countrey and their Fleete,
but that hee would not, for my being discovered. At last
<PB N="460" REF="242"/>
seeing his damnable opinion, and to cleare my selfe of
such false imputations: I requested him to send a Sergeant
to my <HI>Possado</HI> or lodging for my Cloakbag, where he
should see a more evident Testimony of my carriage and
honest purpose, and thereupon, the approbation of my
Prince.</P>
<P>This demaund liked him well, thinking thereby to
finde out all the secrets and practise of my Negotiation
with the English Fleete: Whereupon forthwith, and with
close Circumspection he had it brought unto him, my
hostage House not knowing where I was.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesties Letters and Seals misre∣garded.</NOTE> The Cloakbag
I opened my selfe, and showing him his Majesties Let∣ters
in parchment, and under his Hand and Seale, dated
at <HI>Theobals 1619. Iuly</HI> 17, and compiled and wrot by Mr.
<HI>Thomas Read,</HI> then secretary for the Latin Tongue, done
in my behalfe, and my intended Resolution for <HI>Aethio∣pia,</HI>
the Kings safe Conduct hee mis-regarded, giving it
neither respect nor trust.</P>
<P>After which, I show'd him divers patents, Seales, and
the great seale of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> Pasports, and my Booke
of armes, called <HI>Liber amicorum,</HI> wherein I had the
hand writs, and armes of sundry Kings, Dukes, Princes,
Vice Royes, Marquesses, Earles, Lords, and Gover∣nors,
&amp;c. done in Prose and Verse, in Greeke, Latine, or
their maternall tongues, being as propitious pledges of
their favour, in commendation of mee, and of my
Travailes.</P>
<P>But all these would not satisfie him, nay rather con∣firming
a greater jealousie of his former suspition: where∣upon
misconstruing all, they seased absolutely upon my
Cloak-bag, viewing and detaining all I had at their plea∣sure;
including me the third time. This done, and with¦in
night, being Represented againe, the Governour
<PB N="461" REF="242"/>
commanding me to subscribe my Confession, which I vo∣luntarily
obeyed; though they still urged me further and
further to confesse. Meane while, these foure Complices
consulting about my Imprisonment, the <HI>Aleade</HI> or chief
Justice, would have had me along with him to the Towne
Jayle, but the <HI>Corrigidor</HI> refused, saying <HI>Para non star
visto con sus Pesanos:</HI> that hee may not bee seene by his
Country-men, it behoveth me to have a care of his con∣cealment:
and I warrant you (said hee) I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall lodge him
well enough.</P>
<P>Upon the knowledge of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An injust robbery by unjust Judges.</NOTE> that I was secretly to
be incarcerate in the governours Palace, entered the Mr.
Sergeant, and begged my money, and Licence to search
for it: and liberty granted, he found in my pockets eleve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Philippoes or ducatons; and then uncloathing me bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re
their eyes, even to my shirt, and searching my breeches,
he found in my Doublet necke, fast shut between two
Canvesses, one hundred thirty seven double peeces
of gold. Whereat the <HI>Corrigidor</HI> arose and couu∣ting
my gold, being five hundred forty eight Ducats,
he said to the Sergant, cloath him againe, and inclosed
him there in the Cabinet till after supper, meanewhile
the Sergeant got the eleven duccatons of Silver; and my
gold, which was to carrie me for <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> the Gover∣nour
seased upon, giving afterwards two hundred
Crowns of it to supply the new laid foundation of a
<HI>Capuschine</HI> monastery there, reserving the rest (being
348 duccats for his own avaritious ends.</P>
<P>This done, and mid night come, the Sergant and two
Turkish slaves releasing mee from the inferiour Roome,
brought mee through certaine ascending passages, to a
chamber, in a sequestrate side of the Palace, toward the
Garden, and right about his summer Kitchin: Where
<PB N="462" REF="243"/>
there, and then the Sergeants, and the two slaves, thrust
on every ancle an heavy bolt, my legs put to the
full stride,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And here is the embleme of my misery.</NOTE> by a maine gad of Iron far about a yard long,
upon the ends of which, the two bolts depended, that
were fastned about my legs, in somuch that I could ne∣ver
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="463" REF="243"/>
sit up nor walke, nor stand, nor turne mee; but lay
continually on my back, the irons being thrice heavier
then my body.</P>
<P>Whereupon beholding my inevitable misery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A miserable and helplesse Lamentation.</NOTE> and such
monster-made irons, my sighing soule replyed thus:
<HI>Alas Sergant, and you two Slaves, remarke in mee the iust
Iudgments of god; and loe how the Heavens have reduct∣ed
mee to this meritorious reward, and truely deserved; for
I have dearely and truely bought it; that I, whose leggs and
feete the whole universe could scarcely containe, now these
bolts and irons keepe then fast in a body length, of a stone∣paved
Floore.</HI> O foolish pride, O suppressing ambition!
and vaporous curiosity! woe worth the fury of your as∣piring
vanities; you have taken mee over the face of the
earth, and now left mee in a Dungeon hole: My soule, O
my soule is leager unto this prouerbe <HI>Man proposeth,
and God disposeth:</HI> O happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>had I beene, thrice happy in
a Shepehards life.</P>
<P>Thus and more lamenting the destiny of nature, they
left mee with solacious words, and straight returned a∣gaine
with victuals, being a pound of boild Mutton, a
wheat bread, and a small pint of Wine: which was the
first, the best, and the last of this kinde, that ever I got
in that woefull <HI>Mansion.</HI> The Sergeant leaving me (ne∣ver
seeing him more, till a more unwelcome sight) hee
directed the Slaues, that after I had contented my dis∣contented
appetite, they should lock the doore, and
carry the keyes to <HI>Areta,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and keeper of the
silver plate.</P>
<P>A little while after hee was gone the other drudge left
me also, who was newly turned Christian: where being
alone with <HI>Hazier</HI> the naturall <HI>Turke,</HI> who was to at∣tend
mee, feede mée, and keepe me, lying nightly a con∣strayned
<PB N="464" REF="244"/>
Centinell, without the doore of my imprison∣ment;
hee demanded me for what Cause I was commit∣ted,
and what malefact I was guilty of? to whom I an∣swered,
onely for a naked suspition, mistaking the hono∣rable
intention of the <HI>English</HI> Armado, I am as a spy
apprehended, and falsly accused.</P>
<P>Where upon the silly Slaue falling downe on his knees,
held up his hands, crying, <HI>Hermano, Hermano, es m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
grand menester,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mourning of <HI>Hazior</HI> a <HI>Turkish</HI> slave.</NOTE> <HI>para tomar pacenza, &amp;c.</HI> Brother, Bro∣ther,
it is much needefull for you to take all in patience,
for it is impossible now you can escape some fearefull
tryall, and there upon a horrible punishment even unto
death; and alasse to relieve you, if I durst, (as I dare not
under death) to discover you to your Countrey-men,
I would doe it upon my knees; and leaving mee with a
weeping goodnight, hee made fast the doores, and trans∣ported
the keyes, as he was directed.</P>
<P>The day following the Governour entred my Prison
alone, intreating mee to confesse I was a spy, and hee
would be my friend, and procure my pardon, neither
should I lacke (intirim) any needefull thing: But I still
attesting my innocency, hee wrathfully swore I should
see his face no more, till grievious torments should make
me doe it, and leauing mèe in a rage, hee observed too
well his condition.</P>
<P>But withall in my audience, he commanded <HI>Areta,</HI> that
none should come neare mee, except the slave, nor no
food should be giuen mee, but three ounces of moosted
browne bread, every second day, and a <HI>Fuleto</HI> or <HI>English</HI>
Pint of water, neither any bed, pillow, or coverlet to be
allowed mee: And close up, said he, this window in his
roome, with lime and stone, stop the holes of the doore
with double Matts, hanging another locking to it, and to
<PB N="465" REF="244"/>
withdraw all visible and sensible comfort from him, let
no tongue, nor feete be heard neare him, till I have my
designes accomplished: And thou <HI>Hazior</HI> I charge thee,
at thy incommings to have no conference with him, nor
at thy out goings abroad to discover him to the <HI>English</HI>
Factors, as thou wilt answere upon thy life, and the high∣est
torments can be devised.</P>
<P>These directions delivered, and alas, too accessary to
me in the performance; my roome was made a darke-drawn
Dungeon, my belly the anatomy of mercilesse
hunger, my comfortlesse hearing, the receptacle of
sounding Bells, my eyes wanting light, a loathsome lan∣guishing
in dispaire, and my ground lying body, the
woefull mirrour of misfortunes, every houre wishing a∣nothers
comming, every day the night, and every night
the morning.</P>
<P>And now being every second or third day attended
with the twinckling of an eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A speedie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ex∣pedition for a mercilesse mischiefe.</NOTE> and my sustenance agree∣able
to my attendance, my body grew exceeding debile
and infirme, insomuch that the Gouernour (after his an∣swers
received from <HI>Madrile</HI> made hast to put in ex∣ecution,
his bloody and mercilesse purpose before <HI>Christ∣mas</HI>
Holy dayes, lest the expiring of the twelfth day,
I should bee utterly famished, and unable to undergoe
my tryall, without present perishing, yet unknowne to
me, save onely in this knowledg, that I was confined to
die a fearefull and unacquainted death: for it is a current
custome with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that if a stranger be appre∣hended
upon any suspition, he is never brought to open
tryall, and common Jaile, but clapped up in a Dungeon,
and there tortured, impoisoned, or starved to death.
Such meritorious deeds, accompany these onely titular
Christians: for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> accounteth it more to bee
<PB N="466" REF="245"/>
called a Christian, then either to beleeve what hee pro∣fesseth,
or to conforme himselfe to the life of Chri∣stianity:
yea, I sparingly avouch it, he is the worst and
baddest creature of the christian name; having no more
Religion (and lesse respective to devation) then an ex∣ternall
presumptuous show; which perfiteth this anci∣ent
Proverbe, <HI>The Spaniard; est bonus Catholicus, sed
malus Christianus.</HI></P>
<P>In end, by Gods permission, the scourge of my fiery
tryall opproaching; upon the forty seventh day after
my first imprisonment, and five dayes before <HI>Christ∣mas;</HI>
about two of clock in the morning, I heard the
noyse of a Coach in the fore streete, marvelling much
what it might meane</P>
<P>Within a pretty while I heard the locks of my Pri∣son-doore
in opening;<NOTE PLACE="marg">My transpor∣tation from prison to the fields to be racked.</NOTE> whereupon bequeathing my
soule to God, I humbly implored his gracious mer∣cie
and pardon for my sinnes: for neither in the former
night, nor this could I get any sleep, such was the force
of gnawing hunger, and the portending heavinesse of my
presaging soule.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the former nine Sergeants, accompanied
with the <HI>Scrivan,</HI> entered the room without word
speaking, and carrying mee thence, with irons and
all, on their armes through the house to the street, they
laid mee on my backe in the Coach: where two of
them sat up beside me, (the rest using great silence) went
softly along by the coach side.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Baptista</HI> the Coach-man, an <HI>Indian Negro</HI>
droving out at the Sea gate, the way of the shoare
side, I was brought Westward almost a league from the
Towne, to a vine-pressehouse, standing alone amongst
Vineyards, where they inclosed mee in a roome till
<PB N="467" REF="245"/>
day light, for hither was the Racke brought the night
before, and privily placed in the end of a Trance.</P>
<P>And all this secresie was used, that neither <HI>English,
French,</HI> or <HI>Flemings,</HI> should see or get any knowledge
of my Tryall, my grievous Tortures, and dreadfull dis∣patch,
because of their trecherous and cruel proceedings.</P>
<P>At the breach of day the Governour <HI>Don Francisco,</HI>
and the <HI>Alcalde,</HI> came forth in another Coach: where
when arrived, and I invited to their presence, I plea∣ded
for a Trench-man, being against their Law, to ac∣cuse
or condemne a stranger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A stranger ought not to be accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with strange∣ers without an Interpreter</NOTE> without a sufficient Inter∣preter.
The which they absolutely refused, neither
would they suffer, or grant mee an Appellation to <HI>Ma∣drid.</HI></P>
<P>And now after long and new Examinations, from
morning, to darke night, they finding my first and se∣cond
Confession so runne in one, that the Governour
swore, I had learned the art of memory: saying, fur∣ther,
is it possible hee can in such distresse, and so long
a time, observe so strictly in every manner the points of
his first Confession, and I so often shifting him too and
fro.</P>
<P>Well, the Gouernours interrogation and my Con∣fession
being mutually subscribed: He and <HI>Don Francesco</HI>
besought mee earnestly to acknowledg and confesse my
guiltinesse in time: if not, he would deliver me in the <HI>Al∣caldes</HI>
hands there present: Saying moreover, thou art
as yet in my power, and I may spare or pardon thee, pro∣viding
thou wilt confesse thy selfe a Spie, and a Traytour
against our Nation.</P>
<P>But finding mee stand fast to the marke of my spot∣lesse
innocency, he, invective, and malicious hee, after
many tremenduous threatnings, commanded the Scrivan
<PB N="468" REF="246"/>
to draw up a Warrant for the chiefe Justice: And done,
he set his hand to it, and taking me by the hand, delive∣red
me and the War<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rant in the <HI>Alcalde Majors</HI> hands,
to cause mee bee Tortured, broken, and cruelly Tor∣mented.</P>
<P>Whence being carried along on the Sergeants armes,
to the end of a Trance or stone-Gallery, where the <HI>Pot∣taro</HI>
or Racke was placed: The <HI>Encarnador</HI> or <HI>Tormentor,</HI>
began to disburden me of my irons, which being ve∣ry
hard inbolted he could not Ram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verse the Wedges
for a long time: Whereat the chiefe Justice being offen∣ded,
the malicious Villaine with the Hammer which hee
had in his hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A mercilesse hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, before they begun to rack me.</NOTE> stroake away above an inch of my left
heele with the Bolt. Whereupon I grievously groa∣ning,
being exceeding faint, and without my three
ounces of bread, and a little water for three dayes to∣gether▪
the <HI>Alcalde</HI> said, O Traytor, all this is no∣thing
but the earnest of a greater bargaine you have in
hand.</P>
<P>Now the Irons being dissolved, and my Torments
approaching, I fell prostrate on my knees crying to the
Heavens.</P>
<P>O Great and Gracious GOD, it is truely knowne
to thy allseeing Eye, that I am innocent of these fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
and fearefull accusations, and since therefore it is thy Good
will and pleasure, that I must suffer, now by the sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lerate
hands of mercilesse men; LORD furnish mee with Courage,
Strength, and Patience, least by an impatient Minde,
and feeble Spirit, I become my owne Murtherer, in
Confessing my selfe guilty of Death, to shun present pu∣nishment.
And according to the multitude of thy mercies,
O Lord be mercifull to my sinfull Soule, and that for Ie∣sus
thy Sonne and my Redeemer his sake.</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="246"/>
After this the <HI>Alcalde,</HI> and Scrivan being both Chaire∣set,
the one to examining, the other to write downe my
Confession and Tortures: I was by the Executioner strip∣ped
to the skin, brought to the rack; and then mounted
by him on the top of it: Where eftsoones I was hung
be the pare sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulders, with two small cords, which
went under both my armes running on two rings of
iron that were fixed in the Wall above my head.</P>
<P>Thus being hoysed, to the appointed height, the Tor∣ment
or discended below, and drawing downe my Legs,
through the two sides of the three planked Racke, hee
tyed a Cord about each of my ankles:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hams and lids of my knees were both broken.</NOTE> And then ascen∣ding
upon the racke, hee drew the cords upward, and
bending forward with mainforce my two kneels against
the two planks; the sinewes of my hams burst asun∣der,
and the lids of my knees being crushed, and the
Cords made fast, I hung so demayned, for a large
houre.</P>
<P>At last the <HI>Encarnador,</HI> informing the Governour that
I had the marke of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> on my right arme, joyned
with the name and Crowne of King <HI>Iames,</HI> and done
upon the <HI>Holy Grave;</HI> The <HI>Corridigor</HI> came out of his
adjoyning stance and gave direction to teare a sunder,
the name and Crowne (as hee said) of that Heretike
King, an arch-enemy to the Holy Catholike Church:
Then the tormentor laying the right arme above the
left, and the Crown upmost did cast a cord over both
armes seven distant times: And then lying downe up∣on
his backe, and setting both his feete on my hollow-pinched
belly, he charged and drew violently with his
hands, making my Wombe suppor the force of his
feete, till the seven severall Cords combind in one place
of my arme (and cutting the Crowne, sinewes, and flesh
<PB N="470" REF="247"/>
to the bare bones) did pull in my fingers close to the
palme of my hands; the left hand of which is Lame so
still, and will be for ever.</P>
<P>Now mine eyes began to startle, my mouth to foame
and froath, and my teeth to chatter like to the doubling
of Drummers stickes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">O cruell and inhumane murder.</NOTE> O strange inhumanity of Men,
monster manglers! I surpassing the limits of their national
Law; three score Tortures being the tryall of Treason,
which I had and was to endure: yet thus to inflict a sea∣ven-fold
surplussage of more intollerable cruelties: And
notwithstanding of my shivering lips, in this fiery
passion, my vehement groaning, and blood springing
fonts, from armes, broake sinewes, hammes, and
knees; yea and my depending weight on flesh-cutting
Cords, yet they stroake me on the face with Cudgels,
to abate and cease the thundring noise of my wrestling
voice.</P>
<P>At last being loosed from these Pinnacles of paine, I
was hand-fast set on the floore, with this their incessant
imploration: Confesse, confesse, confesse in time, for
thine inevitable torments ensue: where finding nothing
from me but still innocent, <HI>O I am innocent, O Iesus! the
Lambe of God have mercy upon mee, and strengthen mee
with patience to undergo this barbarous murder.</HI></P>
<P>Then by command of the Justice, was my trembling
body laid above, and along upon the face of the Racke,
with my head downe-ward, inclosed within a circled
hole;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heere begun my maine tor∣tures.</NOTE> my belly upmost, and my heeles upward toward
the top of the Racke, my legs and armes being drawne
asunder, were fastned with pinnes and Cords, to both
sides of the outward plankes; for now was I to receive
my maine torments.</P>
<P>Now what a <HI>Pottaro</HI> or Rack is (for it stood by the
<PB N="471" REF="247"/>
of Timber, the upmost end whereof is larger then a full
stride;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loe h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e manner how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rack∣ed.</NOTE> the lower end being narrow, and the three planks

in the downe-most end of the middle plancke there
was a hole, wherein my head was laid: in length it is lon∣ger

<PB N="472" REF="248"/>
then a man being interlaced with small cords from
plancke to plancke which divided my supported thighes
from the middle plank: Through the sides of which ex∣teriour
planks there were three distant holes in every one
of them; the use whereof you shall presently heare.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Alcalde</HI> giving commission, the executio∣ner
layd first a cord over the calfe of my leg, then an o∣ther
on the middle of my thigh, and the third cord over
the great of my arme; which was severally done on both
sides of my body receiving the ends of the cords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how my body was first fast∣ned to the Rack before my tortures were inflicted.</NOTE> from
these sixe severall places through the holes made in the
outward planks, which were fastned to pinnes, and the
pinnes made fast with a device: for he was to charge on
the outside of the planks, with as many pinnes as there
were holes and cords; the cords being first laid meet to
my skin: And on every one of these sixe parts of my bo∣dy,
I was to receive seven severall tortures: each torture
consisting of three winding throwes of every pinne;
which amounted to twenty one throwes in every one of
these five parts.</P>
<P>Then the Tormentor having charged the first passage
above my body (making fast by a device each torture as
they were multiplyed) he went to an earthen <HI>Iarre</HI> stand∣ing
full of water, a little beneath my head: from whence
carrying a pot full of water; in the bottome whereof,
there was an incised hole, which being st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pped by his
thumb, till it came to my mouth, he did poure it in my
bellie; the measure being a <HI>Spanish Sombre</HI> which is an
<HI>English</HI> Pottle: The first and second services I gladly re∣ceived,
such was the scorching drouth of my tormenting
paine, and likewise I had drunke none for three daies be∣fore.</P>
<P>But afterward, at the third charge perceiving these
<PB N="473" REF="248"/>
measures of water to be inflicted upon me as tortures, O
strangling tortures! I closed my lips againe-standing that
eager crudelity.</P>
<P>Whereat the <HI>Alcalde</HI> inraged, set my teeth asunder
with a payre of iron cadges detaining them there, at e∣very
severall turne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruelty be∣yond cruelt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</NOTE> both mainely and manually; where∣upon
my hunger clungd belly waxing great, grew
Drum-like imbolstred: for it being a suffocating paine,
in regard of my head hanging downeward, and the wa∣ter
re-ingorging it selfe, in my throat, with a strugling
force; it strangled and swallowed up my breath from
youling and gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nong.</P>
<P>And now to prevent my renewing griefe (for present∣ly
my heart faileth and forsaketh me) I will onely
briefe y avouch, that betweene each one of these seven
circular charges I was aye re-examined, each examina∣tion
continuing halfe an houre: each halfe houre a hell
of internall paine; and between each torment, a long
distance of life-quelling time.</P>
<P>Thus lay I five howers upon the Racke, between foure
a clock afternoone, and ten a clocke at night, having
had inflicted upon mee sixtie severall torments: Never∣thelesse
they continued mee a large halfe houre (after all
my torments) at the full bending;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hellish an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insupportable pain.</NOTE> where my body being
all begored with blood, and cut through in every part, to
the crushed and bruised bones, I pittifully remained, still
roaring, howling, foaming; bellowing, and gnashing my
teeth, within supportable cryes, before the pinnes were
undone, and my body loosed.</P>
<P>True it is, it passeth the capacity of man, either sen∣sibly
to conceive, or I patiently to expresse the intollera∣ble
anxiety of mind, and affliction of body, in that dread∣full
time I sustained.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="249"/>
At last my head being by their armes advanced, and
my body taken from the Racke, the water regusned a∣bundantly
from my mouth; then they recloathing my
broken, bloody, and cold trembling body being all this
time starke naked, I fell twice in a founding trance:
which they againe refreshed with a little wine, and two
warme Egges, not for charity done, but that I should be
reserved t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> further punishment; and if it were not too
truly known those sufferings to be of trueth, it would al∣most
seem incredible to many, that a man being brought
so low with starving hunger, and extreame cruelties,
cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d haue subsisted any longer reserving life.</P>
<P>And now at last they charged my br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken legs, with
my former eye-frighting irons, and done, I was lamenta∣bly
carried on their armes to the Coach, being after
mid-night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lamentable remembrance of inhuma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e crueltie.</NOTE> and secretly transported to my former Dun∣geon
without any knowledge to the towne, saue onely
these my lawlesse, and mercilesse Tormentors: where
when come, I was laid with my head and my heeles a∣like
high, on my former stones.</P>
<P>The latter end of this woefull night poor mourning
<HI>Hazier</HI> the <HI>Turke,</HI> was set to keepe me, and on the mor∣row
the governour entred my roome threatning me still
with more tortures to confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; and so caused hee every

and opening of doores:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A dreadful af∣frighting for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to tures.</NOTE> and all this they did of purpose to
affright and distract me, and to make me beleeve I was
going to be racked againe, to make mee confesse an un∣trueth;
and still thus they continued every day of five
dayes till <HI>Christmas.</HI></P>
<P>Upon <HI>Christmas</HI> day <HI>Mariana</HI> the Ladies Gentlewo∣man

brought aboundance of teares, presenting me also with a

the <HI>Turke</HI> comming to mee with bread and water, being

he and the Towne have instantly pulled downe, all

without the shore side adjoyning to the Townes

for there is above a hundred sayle seene comming hi∣thtr;
and therewith kissing my cheeke, he kindly left
mee.</P>
<P>Indeed, as for such news from <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagant;</HI> the detri∣ment
of twenty eight houses, the shoar-planted Cannon,
the suspition they had of the <HI>English,</HI> and the Towne
foure dayes in Armes, were all true, save onely the con∣federacy
of the <HI>English</HI> with the <HI>Moores,</HI> that was false.</P>
<P>Witnesse Sir <HI>Richard Halkins,</HI> and the Captains of his
Squader, who alittle after Christmas comming to the
Road, went to the Governour to cleare himselfe, and the
<PB N="476" REF="250"/>
Fleete of that absurd imputation laid to their charge.
The twelfth day of <HI>Christmas</HI> expired, they began
to threaten me on still with more Tortures, even till <HI>Can∣dlemasse:</HI>
In all which comfortlesse time, I was misera∣bly
afflicted with the beastly plague of gnawing vermin,
which lay crawling in lumps, within, without, and a∣bout
my body: yea hanging in clusters about my beard,
my lips, my nostrils, and my eye-browes almost inclo∣sing
my sight.</P>
<P>And for a greater satisfaction to their mercilesse
mindes, the <HI>Governour</HI> caused <HI>Areta,</HI> his silver plate kee∣per,
to gather and sweep the vermine upon me twice in
eight dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No pain so grievous, as a lame man to be still tor∣mented with gnawing ver∣mine.</NOTE> which tormented me to the death, being a
perpetuall punishment; for mine armes being broke, my
hands lucken, and sticking fast to the palms of both hands
by reason of the shrunke sinewes; I was unable to lift
mine armes to stirre my fingers; much lesse to avoid the
filthy Vermine: neither could my legs and feet per∣forme
it, being impotent in all. Yet I acknowledge the
poore Infidell, some few times, and when opportunity
served, would steale the keyes from <HI>Areta,</HI> and about
mid-night would enter my room, with sticks and
burning oyle, and sweeping them together in heapes,
would burne the greatest part, to my great release; or
doubtlesse I had beene miserable eat up, and devoured
by them.</P>
<P>And now some eight dayes before <HI>Candlemasse,</HI> the
slave informed me, that an English Seminary Priest, born
in <HI>London,</HI> and belonging to the Bishops Colledge of
<HI>Malaga;</HI> and a <HI>Scotish</HI> Cowper named <HI>Alexander Ley,</HI>
borne in <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and there married were in Transla∣ting

the <HI>Spanish</HI> tongue, bringing every other dayes numbers
<PB N="477" REF="250"/>
of wrot Papers to the Governour, and for their paines
had thirty duccats allowed, and that they were saying,
I was an Arch-Hereticke to the Pope, and the Virgin
<HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>Having re-dounded him concealed thanks, I was assu∣red
of their bloody Inquisition, preparing my selfe in
God, with Faith, and patience to receive and gain-stand
it: for my spirituall Resolution was surely founded; be∣ing
sightlesse of Company, and humane faces, I had in∣tirely
the light of my Soule celebrate to God Almighty.</P>
<P>And hereupon the second day after <HI>Candlemas,</HI> the
Governour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A politick en∣quiry of a damnable in∣quisition.</NOTE> the Inquisitor a Canonicall Priest, entered
my dungeon accompained with two Jesuites, one of
which was <HI>Predicator,</HI> and superior of the <HI>Tiatinean</HI>
Colledg of <HI>Malaga:</HI> Where being Chaire set, Candle
lighted, and doore locked; the inquisitor after diverse
frivolous questions, demanded me if I was a Roman
Catholik, and acknowledged the Popes Supremacy.
To whom I answered, I was neither the one, or did
the other. And what power (said I,) have you to chal∣lenge
me of my Religion, since it is a chiefe Article, of
the former concluded peace, that one of our Kings sub∣jects
should be troubled by your Inquisition; but as you
have murdred me for alledged Treason, so you meane to
Martyr me for Religion.</P>
<P>And you Governour, as you have Tortured and hun∣ger-starved
this helpelesse body, consumed with cold and
Vermine to the last of my life; the Almighty God who
revealeth the secrets of all things (although I be never
relieved) will certainely discover it to my Countrey and
to the World. And is this the best of your good deeds
you repay to our mercifull King, who then being onely
King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the time of your just over-throw
<PB N="478" REF="251"/>
of Eighty Eight, gave secourse to thousands of your
Ship-wracked people for many moneths; and in the end
caused transport them safely to their desired Ports. Lea∣ving
to the Worlds memory an eternall stampe of Chri∣stian
Bounty, Mercy, and Royall Charitid: and your ac∣quittance
to him, is an imputation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reachery to his
Fleete, detaining and mis-regarding his Letters and
Seales, and now imposing to a tormented Innocent, your
lawlesse Inquisition.</P>
<P>To which the Governour answered, all tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was true,
but it was done more through feare then love, and there∣fore
deserved the lesser thankes; but (intrim) wee will
follow the uttermost of our ends. And the Jesuite <HI>Pre∣dicator</HI>
to confirme his words, said, there was no Faith
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee kept with <HI>Heretikes,</HI> which directly or indirectly
is the sublime policy of Conquerours, which our migh∣ty
and innumerable Nation evermore taketh notice of
and observeth.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Inquisitor</HI> arising,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A damnable Inquisitor ap∣plying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse attributes to our blessed Lady.</NOTE> expressed himselfe thus:

and sole Gubernatrix of the Earth, &amp;c. How thou
being first taken as a Spye, accused for Trechery, and
innocently Tortured (as we acknowledge we were better
informed lately from <HI>Madrile</HI> of the English intention)
yet it was her power, her Divine power, which brought
these judgments upon thee it that thou hast wrote ca∣lumniously

<P>Then in leaving me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Sycophan∣ticall Oration from a jug∣ling Jebusite.</NOTE> the Jesuite <HI>Predicator</HI> making a

you deserve to be burnt quick; but by the grace of our Lady

save your soule and body:</HI> Spewing forth also this Faemi∣nine

imploring his grace to rectify my thoughts, illuminate

mundane Respects whatsoever.</P>
<P>The next morning, the three Ecclesiastickes returned,
and being placed with Chaires and Candles, the <HI>Inqui∣sitor</HI>
made <HI>interrogation,</HI> of what difficulties, errours, or
mis-beleefe I had: To whom ingenuously I answered I
had none, neither any difficulty, errour, nor mis-be∣liefe;
but was confident in the promises of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI>
and assuredly believed his revealed will in the Gospell,
professed in the Reformed Catholike Church; which
<PB N="480" REF="252"/>
being confirmed by Grace, I had the infallible assurance
in my soule, of the true Christian Faith.</P>
<P>To these words hee answered, thou art no Christian,
but an absurd <HI>Hereticke,</HI> and without conversion, a
member of perdition, whereupon I replyed, Reverend
Sir, the nature of Charity and Religion, doe not consist
in opprobrious speeches; wherefore if you would convert
mee (as you say) convince mee by Argument: if not, all
your threatnings of Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fury of a mad Inquisi∣tor to have almost slaine mee.</NOTE> Death, nor Torments, shall

on the face with his foote, busing mee with many Ray∣lings,
and if the Jesuits had not intercepted him, hee
had stabbed me with a knife; where when dismissed, I ne∣ver
saw him more.</P>
<P>The third day insuing (and having broake their pro∣mise)
the two Jesuits returned, and after a frowning si∣lence
the Superiour asked mee of my resolution: I told
him I was resolved already unlesse hee could shew mee
good reasons in the contrary. Whereupon having past
with me some few superficiall Arguments of their seven
Sacraments, Intercession, Transubstantiation? Images,
Purgatory, Miracles, Merit, &amp;c. he begun to brag of their

Christ had ever his owne Church (howsoever obscure)
in the greatest time of your darknesse,</P>
<P>So <HI>Rome</HI> foure hundred yeares and upward, was the
true Church; but afterward falling in apostacy by meanes
of her corrupt leaders, wee have left her in nothing, but
what shee hath left her former selfe. Universall? no, al∣hough
shee assumeth a Catholike name, was not the

<P>With no small adoe, <HI>Boniface</HI> the third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>btained of
<HI>Phocas</HI> the Emperour to bee called universall Bishop:
which was assisted afterward by <HI>Pippin</HI> the <HI>Frenh</HI> King,
and ratified by <HI>Paleologus,</HI> the Father of <HI>Constantine,</HI> who
lost <HI>Constantinople:</HI> And what long controversies about

<P>The <HI>Bavarians</HI> in their own language sing the Psalms

<P>It is most evident, what your former Popes have con∣firmed,

beare a true record.</P>
<P>And was there not at one time, three Popes in three

pray you (father) where your uniformity, much lesse your
universality and worst of all your antiquity.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded, the fiery fac'd Jesuits, with
boisterous menacings left mee; and the eight day thereaf∣ter,
being the last day of their Inquisition, they returned
againe, in a more milder disposition: where after divers
arguments on both sides, the two Jesuites with Teares
distilling from their eyes, solidly protested, they were
sorry from their heart, for that terrible death J was to
undergo, and above all, the loosing of my Soule. And fal∣ling
down on their knees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jesuits last allure∣ments for my conversion to their sect.</NOTE> cryed, <HI>Convert, convert, O deare
brother! for our blessed Ladies sake convert:</HI> To whom J
replyed, that neither death nor fire J feared; for J was re∣solved
for both: yet thinking my selfe unworthy to suf∣fer
for Christ and the Gospels sake considering my vile∣nesse
and my owne unworthinesse: yet the spirit of
God assureth my faith it is his divine pleasure it should
be so that J must suffer: Wherefore if J should divert,
trust mee not, for J would but dissemble with you
(through feare, flattery, or force) to shun present death.</P>
<P><HI>Whereupon they called the Governour, and after their
privy consulting, hee thus spoke;</HI> Dear brother, my grea∣test
desire is to have thee a good Christian, a Romane Ca∣tholike,
to which if thy conscience will yeeld, I will shew
thee as great curtesie, as thou hast received cruelty; for
pitty it were, that such an invincible spirit and endued
with so many good parts, should perish in both worlds fore∣ver.
Pluck up thy heart, and let the love of our blessed
Lady enter in thy soule: Let not thy former sufferings dis∣may
thee (for thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ores being yet greene and curable) I
shall transport thee to a fine Chamber; and there thou shalt
<PB N="483" REF="253"/>
haue all needfull things for the recouery of thy health and
strength. Thy money and Patents shall he refounded, but
thy hereticall Bookes are already burned: <HI>And lastly sayde
he,</HI> I will send thee with my owne seruant to Court, Counsell
and King, with letters from the holy inquisition, and from
mee, faithfully promising thou shalst enioy a Pension of
three hundred Duccats a yeare.</P>
<P>But hauing satisfied his bewitching policy with a Chri∣stian
constancy; they all three left me in a thundering
rage; vowing I should that night have the first seal of my
long sorrowes: And directing their course to the Bishop
and Inquisitor (for the Gouernour had wrested the in∣quisition
vpon mee, to free him of his former aspersion
layde upon the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, and my tryall therefore,
converting it all to matters of Religion) the Inquisition
(I say) sat forth with,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Conde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣natory Sen∣tence to death by the Inqui∣sition.</NOTE> where first I was condemned to
receiue that night eleuen strangling torments in my dun∣geon:
and then after <HI>Easter</HI> Holy dayes, I should be
transported priuatly to <HI>Grenada,</HI> and thereabout mid∣night
to be burnt body and bones into ashes, and my
ashes to be flung into the ayre: Well, that same night
the Scriuan, Sergeants, and the young <HI>English</HI> Priest en∣tered
my melancholly staunce: where the Priest in the
<HI>English</HI> tongue vrging me all that he could (though lit∣tle
it was he could doe) and vnpreuailing, I was dis∣burdened
of mine irons, vnclothed to my skin, set on
my knees and held vp fast with their hands: where instant∣ly
setting my teeth asunder with iron Cadges, they filled
my belly full of water, euen gorgeing to my throate:
Then with a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rter they bound fast my throat, till the
white of mine eye turned vpward; and being laid on my
side, I was by two Sergeants tumbled too and fro seuen
times through the roome; euen til I was almost strang∣led:
<PB N="484" REF="254"/>
This done, they fastned a small cord about each one
of my great toes, and hoysing me therewith to the roofe
of a high loft (for the cords runne on two rings of iron
fastned above) they cut the garter, and there I hung with
my head downward, in my tormented weight, till all
the gushing water dissolved: This done, I was let downe
from the loft, quite senslesse, lying a long time cold dead
among their hands: whereof the Governour being infor∣med,
came running vp stayres, crying, Is he dead? O fie
villans, goe fetch me Wine, which they powred in my
mouth, regayning thereby a slender sparke of breath.</P>
<P>These strangling torments ended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Turkish</HI> slaves charity in the bowels of compassion.</NOTE> and I reclothed,
and fast bolted againe, they left mee lying on the cold
floore praysing my God, and singing of a Psalme. The
next morning the pittifull <HI>Turke</HI> visiting mee with bread
and water, brought me also secretly in his shirt-sleeve,
two handfull of Rasins and figges, laying them on the
floore amongs the crawling vermine, for having no
use of armes nor hands, I was constrayned by hunger and
impotency of time, to licke one up with another with my
tongue: This charity of figs the slave did once every
weeke or fortnight, or else I had long ere then famished.</P>
<P>After which sorrowfull distresse, and inhumane usage,
the eye-melting <HI>Turke</HI> taking displeasure, fell five dayes
sicke, and bed fast: but the house <HI>Spaniards</HI> understand∣ing
his disease made him beleeve, I was a Divell, a Sorce∣rer,
a Negromancer, and a blasphemous miscreant, a∣gainst
their Pope, their Lady, and their Church; giving
him such a distast, that for thirty dayes, he never durst
looke me in the face, being affraid of witchcraft.</P>
<P>All this time of his absence, one <HI>Ellinor</HI> the Cooke,
an <HI>Indian Negro</HI>-woman, attended mee for she being
a Christian drudge, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d more liberty to visit mee, than

the slavish Infidell: who certainly (vnder God) prolon∣ged
then my languishing life, conveighing me for foure

<P>Now about the middle of <HI>Lent, Hazier,</HI> my former
Friend, was appoynted to attend me agayne, suspecting
<HI>Ellenors</HI> compassion; but as my miseries were multiplied,
my Patience in God was redoubled: For men are rather
killed with the impatience they have in adversity, then
adversity it selfe: And of all men, that man is most vn∣happy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An impatient mind in trou∣ble is a triple torture.</NOTE> to whom God in his troubles hath not given
Patience; for as the violent enemy of age is griefe, so is
the mindes impatiency, the arch corruptor of all our
troubles: But indeede in the weakenesse of judgement,
when men seeme lost by long affliction to themselves,
then they are often and ever neerest to God: for who
would have thought, that I who had seene so many sexs
and varieties of Religion, dispersed over the face of the
earth, could have stucke fast to any Religion at all: Tra∣vailers
being reputed to be <HI>Vbique et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mnibus parati.</HI> But
I will tell thee Christian, it was the grace of God in
me, and not mine: For as fire lying hid vnder ashes, and
touch'd will flame; so I seeming to my selfe carelesse of
Christianity, then God pricking my Conscience made
tryall of my Faith: For <HI>Christ</HI> forbid, that every Shippe
which coasteth the rockey shoare, should leave her ruines
there.</P>
<P>This I speake not for any selfe-prayse, but to glorifie
God, and to condemne the rash censures of opinion, and

of <HI>Grenada</HI> to <HI>Malaga,</HI> whom the <HI>Governour</HI> one night
invited to Supper, being of old acquaintance: where af∣ter
Supper to intertaine Discourse, the <HI>Governour</HI> rela∣ted
and disclosed to the stranger (God working thereby
my discovery and deliverance) all the proceedings and
causes of my first apprehending, my confessions, Tor∣ments,
starvings, their mistaking of the English Fleete,
and finally the wresting of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> upon me, and
their Condemnatory Sentence; seeming also much to
Lament my mis-fortunes, and praising my Travailes and
Deserts.</P>
<P>Now all this while, the Gentlemans servant, a <HI>Flan∣drish
Fleming,</HI> standing at his <HI>Maisters</HI> back, and ad∣hering
to all the <HI>Governours</HI> Relations, was astonished,
to heare of a sakelesse <HI>Stranger,</HI> to have indured, and to

the <HI>Discourse</HI> ending, and midnight past, the <HI>Stranger</HI>
re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned to his Lodging; where the <HI>Fleming</HI> having bed∣ded
his <HI>Master,</HI> and himselfe also in another Roome,
he could not sleepe all that night, and if hee slumbered,
still hee thought hee saw a man <HI>Torturing,</HI> and burning
in the fire: which he confessed to Mr. Wilds when mor∣ning
came.</P>
<P>Well, he longed for day, and it being come, and hee
cloathed, hee quietly left his lodging, inquiring for
an English Factor, and comming to the House of Mr. <HI>Ri∣chard

all what hee heard the Governour tell his Master, but
could not tell my name: only Master <HI>Richard Wilds</HI> con∣jectur'd

and of his first and former acquaintance with

<P>Whereupon the <HI>Fleming</HI> being dismissed, he straight

I was transported to a ship bound for <HI>England,</HI> the

eight pounds of Sugar, a number of excellent good bread

of his loue.</P>
<P>The kindnesses of whom to bury in oblivion, were in
me the very shame of ingratitude, I being then a lost man
and hopelesse of life, which argued in them a greater
singularitie of kindnesse and compassion. Yet I re∣member
for all my lamenes and distraction, I intreated
Sir <HI>Richard Halkins</HI> to goe ashoare to the Governour,
and demand him for my Gold, my eight Patents, my

the which he willingly obeyed, being accompanied with

had for wrongs past, no, neither (alasse) for any present
in either meane, or mighty falls: for when the Starres of

of the inconstancy of fortune; what shall I then in a pri∣uate
life, and publicke pilgrimage expect, but the com∣mon
calamity of this age, and the irrevocable redresse

<P>So would I,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Incompatible griefe without deserved re∣liefe.</NOTE> oppressed I, by mighty powers (though

me; then was I forcibly (I say) constrayned to preferre a
bill of grievance to the upper house of Parliament <HI>An∣no</HI>
1626. which I dayly followed 17. weekes: well; my

in behalfe of the Lords of the upper house: the order

apprehended by command of the Governor and Magistrates
there as a Spie, whom they suspected, had of purpose beene
left behind by our Generall, and us of the Counsell of Warre,
for the Discovery of that place, and other adjacent parts:
Whereupon being secretly imprisoned in the Governours
Palace; and after serious examination of our intention;
he was without any cause done, or offered by him, most
uniustly put to the cruell Racke and tortures; besides all
other his vnspeakable miseries, which for a long time he su∣stained
thereafter: whereof I was credibly and infallibly
informed by <HI>Mr▪ Richard Wilds,</HI> to whom he was first dis∣covered,

of his long imprisonment, and after his deliverance. And
afterward the Governour there beeing better informed of
our loyall proceedings in those parts, and to colour their
former cruelties▪ and suspition had of us, hee did wrest the
Inquisition vpon him, where being condemned to Death,
he had doubtlesse vndergone (as I was likewise truely infor∣med

Inquisition: if it had not beene, for the Religious care, and

And now to conclude this Tragical discourse, the Re∣ligious
eye, may perceive, Gods compassionate love, foure
wayes here extended. First, his powerfull providence
in my long and admirable preservation in Prison: hunger,
Vermine, and Tortures, being my comfortlesse Com∣panions.
Secondly, the pittifull kindnes of his All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>see∣ing
Eye, in the miraculous Wonder of my Discovery,
when the perverted policy of subtile Serpents, had scele∣ratly
suggested my concealement. Thirdly, his vnspeak∣able
mercy in my vnlooked-for deliverance, beeing by
hopelesse me, not thought, nor sought; and yet by his
munificence was wrought. And lastly, his gracious
goodnesse, in the recovery (after some large measure) of
my health and vse of my body againe; all praise and glory
be to his infinite Majesty therefore.</P>
<P>ANd finally, merit beeing masked, with the darke∣nesse

and so to <HI>Carlile:</HI> I found heere in <HI>Galloway</HI> in diuerse
Rode-way Innes, as good Cheare, Hospitality, and Ser∣uiceable

<P>The Wool of which Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nobility and commodi∣ties of Gallo∣way excell in goodnesse.</NOTE> is nothing inferiour

there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n sheepes backes: the Mutton whereof excelleth
in sweetnesse. So this Country aboundeth in Bestiall, e∣specially

All which in each degree, as they illuminat the soile with
grandure, so the soyle reflecteth on them againe with
beauty, bounty, and riches.</P>
<Q><PB N="505" REF="264"/>
<L>But least I partiall prove, because my breath</L>
<L>First sprung from <HI>Lanerk,</HI> so my Christian faith;</L>
<L>Where thence (O natall place) my soule did coyle,</L>
<L>Blood sprit, and sense, flesh, birth, life, love, and soyle,</L>
<L>I'le leave <HI>Clydes</HI> fragrant fields, resplendant banks,</L>
<L>Bedeckt with <HI>Silvans;</HI> stately beauteous ranks</L>
<L>Of <HI>Pandedalian</HI> sparks; which lend the sight</L>
<L>Of variable colours, best Natures light;</L>
<L>And close these silver shades, that dazeling bloome</L>
<L>Mongst thickest Groves; with many braue-fac'd broome;</L>
<L>Strict in the records of eternall fame,</L>
<L>For sight, for gaine, for birth, for noble name.</L></Q>
<P>And now the second soile for pleasure, is the platformd
Carse of <HI>Gowry,</HI> twelve miles long (Wheat, Rye, Cornes,
Fruit yards, being its onely commodity) which I may
tearme for its levell'd face, to be the Garden of <HI>Angus;</HI>
yea, the Diamond-plot of <HI>Tay,</HI> or rather the youngest
Sister of matchlesse <HI>Piemont:</HI> The Inhabitants being
onely defective in affablenesse, and communicating cour∣tesses
of naturall things, whence sprung this proverbe,
<HI>The kearlles of the Carse.</HI></P>
<P>The third, and beautifull soyle, is the delectable pla∣nure
of <HI>Murray,</HI> thirty miles long, and sixe in breadth:
whose comely grounds, inriched with Cornes, plantings,
pastorage, stately dwellings, overfaced with a generous
<HI>Octavian</HI> Gentrye, and topped with a Noble Earle, its
chiefest Patrone; it may be furstyled, a second <HI>Lombar∣dy,</HI>
or pleasant Meaddow of the North.</P>
<P>Neither may I (abandoning eye-pleasing grounds)
seclude here that <HI>Iudaick</HI> bottome, reaching thirty miles

life of <HI>Barwick.</HI></P>
<P>Now as for the Nobility and Gentry of the King∣dome;
certainely, as they are generous, manly and full
of courage; so are they courteous, discreet, learned
Schollers, well read in best Histories, delicate linguists,
the most part of them being brought vp in <HI>France</HI> or
<HI>Italy:</HI> That for a general compleat worthinesse, I neuer
found their matches amongst the best people of forrane
Nations: being also good house keepers, affable to stran∣gers,
and full of Hospitality.</P>
<P>And in a word the Seas of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Iles abound
plentifully in all kinde of fishes, the Riuers are ingorged
with <HI>Salmond,</HI> the high-landish mountaines ouercled
with Firre-trees, infinite Deere, and all sorts of other Be∣stiall,
the Valleyes full of pasture, and Wild fowle; the
low layd playnes inriched with beds of grayne; Iustice
all where administred, Lawes obeyed, malefactors puni∣shed,
Oppressors curbed, the Clergy religious, the people
sincere professors, &amp; the Country peaceable to all men.
The chiefest commodities whereof transported beyond
sea, are these, Wheat, Cornes, Hides, Skins, Tallow, Yearn
Linnen, Salt, Coale, Herrings, Salmond, Wool, Keilling

<P>Forsaking <HI>Cathnes,</HI> I imbraced the trembling Surges
(at <HI>Dungsby</HI>) of strugling <HI>Neptune,</HI> which ingorgeth
<HI>Pentland</HI> or <HI>Pictland</HI> Firth with nine contrarious Tides:
eath Tide over-thwarting another with repugnant cour∣ses,
have such violent streames, and combustious waves,
that if these dangerous Births be not rightly taken in pas∣sing
over, the Passengers shall quickely loose sight of
<PB N="512" REF="268"/>
life and land for ever: yea, and one of these tides so for∣ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,
at the backe of <HI>Stromaij,</HI> that it will carry any Ves∣sell
back ward, in despight of the winds, the length of its
rapinous current.</P>
<P>This dreadfull <HI>Firth</HI> is in breadth betweene the Con∣tinent
of <HI>Cathnes,</HI> and the Ile of South <HI>Rannaldshaw</HI> in
<HI>Orknay</HI> twelve miles: And I devote this credibly, in a
part of the Northwest end of this Gulfe, there is a cer∣taine
place of sea, where these destracted tydes make their
rancountering Randevouze, that whirleth ever about; cut∣ting
in the middle circle a devalling hole, with which if
either Ship or Boat shall happen to encroach, they must
quickly either throw over some thing into it, as a Barrell,
a peice of timber, and such like, or that fatall <HI>Euripus</HI>
shall then suddenly become their swallowing Sepulcher.
A custome which these bordering <HI>Cathenians</HI> and <HI>Orcadi∣ans</HI>
have ever heretofore observed.</P>
<P>Arriv'd at South <HI>Rannaldshaw</HI> an Ile of five miles long,
and thwarting the Ile of <HI>Burray,</HI> I sighted <HI>Kirkwall,</HI> the
<HI>Metrop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le</HI> of <HI>Pomonia,</HI> the mayne Land of <HI>Orknay,</HI> and
the onely Mistresse of all the circumjacent Iles being thir∣ty
in number. The chiefest whereof (besides this tract
of ground, in length twenty sixe, and broad five, sixe and
seven miles) are the Iles of <HI>Sanda, Westra,</HI> and <HI>Stronza:
Kirkwall</HI> it selfe is adorned with the stately and magnifick
Church of St. <HI>Magnus</HI> built by the <HI>Danes,</HI> whose Sig∣niory
with the Iles lately it was: but indeed for the time
present, more beautified with the godly life of a most ve∣nerable
and religious Bishop Mr. <HI>George Grahame,</HI> whom
now I may tearme (Soveraignity excepted) to be the Fa∣ther
of the Countries government, then an Ecclesiasticke
Prelat: The Inhabitants being left void of a Governour,
or solid Patron, are just become like to a broken battell, a
<PB N="513" REF="268"/>
scattered people without a head: hauing but a Burges-Shreiue
to administer Iustice, and he also an Aliene to
them, and a Resider in <HI>Edenburgh:</HI> So that in most diffe∣rences,
and questions of importance, the Plaintiues are
inforced to implore the Bishop for their Iudge, and hee
the aduerse Party for redresse.</P>
<P>But the more remote p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts of this auncient little King∣dome,
as <HI>Zetland,</HI> and the adiacent Iles there; haue found
such a sting of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccular gouerment within these few
yeares, that these once happy Iles, Which long agoe my
feet traded ouer, are Metamorphosed in the Anatomy of
succourlesse oppression, and the felicity of the Inhabi∣tants
reinuolued within the closet of a <HI>Cittadinean</HI> cluster.</P>
<P>But now referring the whole particulars, and diuidual
descriptions of these Septentrion Iles, the mayne conti∣nent,
and the Gigantick <HI>Hebridian</HI> Iles, to my aforesayd
worke to be published, intitulated <HI>Lithgows surueigh of
Scotland,</HI> I send this generall verdict to the world:</P>
<L>Now having seene most part of thy selfe glore▪</L>
<L>Great Kingdomes, Ilands, stately Courts, rich Townes,</L>
<L>Most gorgeous showes, pomp-glory deckt renownes,</L>
<L>Hearbagious fields, the Pelage-beating shoare</L>
<L>Propitious Princes, Prelats, potent Crownes:</L>
<L>Smoake shadow'd times, curst Churles, Misers, Clownes,</L>
<L>Impregnate Forts, devalling floods, and more</L>
<L>Earth-gazing heights, Vayle curling Plaines in store:</L>
<L>Court-rasing honours, throwne on envies frownes;</L>
<L>Worme-vestur'd workes, Enamild Arts, wits lore:</L>
<L>Masse-marbled Mansions, Mineralls coynd Ore,</L>

<L>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oath thy sight, pale streames, staine watry eyne,</L>
<L>Whose glorious shades evanish, <HI>no more seene.</HI></L>
<P><PB N="514" REF="269"/>
And now to conclude, as a Painter▪ may spoyle a Pic∣ture,
but not the face; so may some Stoicall Reader mis∣conster
and misconceiue some parts of this eye-set Histo∣ry,
though not able to marre the truth of it: yet howso∣ever,
here is the just relation of nineteene yeares travells,
perfited in three deare bought voyages: The generall
computation of which dimmensious spaces, in my goings,
traversings, and returnings, through Kingdomes,
Continents, and Ilands, which my paynefull feet
traced over (besides my passages of Seas and
Rivers) amounteth to thirty six thousand
and odde miles, which draweth neare
to twice the circumference of the
whole Earth. And so
farewell.</P>
