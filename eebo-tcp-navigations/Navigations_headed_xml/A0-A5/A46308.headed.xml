<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THe War in which the <HI>Confederates</HI> are at
present engag'd against that Disturber of
all <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King, having been
of late the chief Subject of Discourse a∣mongst
all sorts of People; nothing certainly can be
more diverting, than to entertain the Reader with
a <HI>Diary</HI> of the Proceedings this last <HI>Campaign</HI> in
<HI>Flanders;</HI> wherein is very carefully and particular∣ly
set down, whatever may be thought worthy of Re∣mark.
And, whereas in most <HI>Histories,</HI> many Things
are taken meerly upon Trust or Hearesay, our Author
(who was a Person of Worth and Note, and had a
Considerable Post in the Army) being an Eye Witness of
every Transaction; the Reader is not in the least Dan∣ger
of being impos'd upon, or of swallowing Fables and
Falsities instead of Truths. But, besides the <HI>Military</HI>
Transactions, you have likewise here a <HI>Topographical</HI>
Description of those Places the Army pass'd through in
their March; in which, the Situation of the <HI>Towns,</HI>
their <HI>Fortifications, Buildings, Curiosities, Customs</HI>
of the People, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not omitted.</P>
<P>And, what is still more inviting; all those who are
Friends to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest, must needs take
infinit Pleasure in seeing that good Agreement amongst
<PB REF="3"/>
the <HI>Confederates;</HI> which is no small Presage of Victory
and future Success. For, if the <HI>Christians</HI> by their
being Ʋnanimous, strike Terror and Amazement a∣mongst
the <HI>Infidels</HI> in <HI>Hungary, Venice, Dalmatia,</HI>
and wherever they come; we need not doubt, but, if
we take Advantage of this happy Juncture of Affairs,
and proceed as Ʋnaimously as we have begun; not only
to rescue from Slavery many of those poor Creatures who
groan under the <HI>French</HI> Yoak, but so to humble that
proud <HI>Monster,</HI> as to make him beg leave to live quietly at
home, without disturbing his Neighbours, and dispos∣sessing
them of their Dominions.</P>

<HEAD>A True Relation of the Actions and
Motions of the Confederate Army
in Brabant, Anno. 1689. With a
short Historical Account of Hol∣land
and Flanders.</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE N="June 9th 1689."/> HAving left <HI>London</HI> at the same time with his
Grace the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> in Company of the
Honourable the Earl of <HI>Pembrook,</HI> Embassador
for <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Lazington,</HI> Envoy to
the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who had one Man of War and
two Yaughts for their Convoy; <MILESTONE N="11"/> the first Land we made,
was the <HI>Brill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bril,</HI> Is surrounded with a Water and a Sodwork-Forti∣fication,
which is very Regular; here we made no stay,
but sailed with the greatest hast up the <HI>Maze</HI> to <HI>Rotterdam;</HI>
having by the way the diversion of seeing <HI>Howse<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dike,
Blackwall, Lorden, Skelden,</HI> and several other very pretty
Towns situated along the River.</P>
<P><HI>Rotterdam,</HI> Here we stay'd three days, and were di∣verted
daily with viewing the admirable neatness and curi∣ous
order of every thing, relating to the Houses and
Streets of this fair City, where no Carts are suffered, but
Sledds and Wheelbarrows, that the Pavements may not
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
be endamaged: <MILESTONE N="June 14th 1689."/> In the Market-Place of this Town, is the
Statue of <HI>Erasmus</HI> in Brass: In the great Church, is the Mo∣nument
of Admiral <HI>Du Wit;</HI> to the top of the Steeple is
One Hundred and Twenty Steps. Ships of large Burthen,
come up to most of the Houses in the Town; for the
Conveniency of their Passage there are several Draw-Bridges,
which are raised to give way when their occasions
lead them to bring them up or down. The Banks of
the Rivers, which are the Streets, are planted with Lime
and Elm-Trees, which give their Shade in Summer and
Shelter in Winter, and are a very great Ornament to the
Town; the middle of whose Streets, are very curiously
Paved with Stone; and the outside for two yards broad,
with Clinker-Brick: Their Doors and Window-shutters, are
all painted Green: Their Houses are neatly kept within,
and placed in admirable order without: Their Men are
tollerably fashionable, but their Women are generally Fat,
burly and unsightly; they all go in Slippers, and their
Coats come down but half way their Legs. Here is a
sumptuous <HI>Stadhouse</HI> and <HI>Exchange,</HI> and I think every thing
that can contribute to the composing of a lovely, decent,
rich, commodious City. On the 14th we went to <HI>Delf,</HI> in
order to see the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Delf,</HI> To this place it is by Water two Leagues from
<HI>Rotterdam.</HI> Our Boat was drawn by a Horse, rid by a Boy, who
Trots him all the way, and in two hours time comes to his
Journeys end. There are about sorty of these Boats (which
are much like your Aldermens Barges on the <HI>Thames</HI>)
which will contain about Forty Passengers; these Boats are
so ordered, that one of them is to go this Course every
half hour: There are likewise at <HI>Delf</HI> other Boats, which
are obliged to go every hour to the <HI>Hague.</HI> The Buildings
of this City are much after the same manner with <HI>Rotterdam:</HI>
Here are two spacious Churches, hung all round and richly
beautified with Coats of Arms; in the Old Church lyeth
the Body and Monument of Admiral <HI>Van Trump;</HI> in the
New Church lyeth Interred the Body of <HI>William Henrick
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Van Nassau<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> First Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> as stately a Monument
as most in <HI>Westminster.</HI> Here are likewise interred three more
Princes and Princesses; Over the Door of the <HI>Stadhouse</HI>
are Engraven these two <HI>Latine</HI> Verses,
<Q><L>Haec domus odit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat</L>
<L>Nequitiam, Pacem, Crimina, jura, probos.</L></Q>
From <HI>Delf</HI> to the <HI>Hague</HI> is a League by Water, and it costs
Two Pence half peny the Passage in one of the foremen∣tioned
Boats.</P>
<P><HI>Hague,</HI> Here is the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Court about a
quarter of a League from the Town (for this is not a City,
although it doth surpass several Cities iin Grandure.) In a
Grove hard by, is a very fine Mall. In the <HI>Stadhouse</HI> of
this Town is the Burgermasters Chamber, wherein is
placed the Strappado: Two Leagues from this place is
<HI>Hounslerdike,</HI> where the Prince hath a very stately Pallace,
whereunto appertaineth several Rarities, among which is
an Ostridg and some Indian Oxen; He hath likewise another
fine Pallace in the Grove near the <HI>Hague,</HI> in which is a very
spacious Hall adorned with several curious Sculptures; from
the <HI>Hague</HI> to <HI>Skeeveline</HI> is a Walk about two Miles in length,
paved all the way with Clinker-Brick. About half way is the
Heer <HI>Bentings</HI> House, now Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> whereunto apper∣taineth
a very famous Orange Garden, with a large Bird-Cage
which is sixteen Rood long, and twelve Foot broad:
To the top of the great Steeple of the <HI>Hagus</HI> is Three
hundred Steps, and in the Church thereof is the Monu∣ment
of <HI>Obdam,</HI> the famous Admiral of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet,
who was blown up together with his Ship as he was coming
to an Engagement with the <HI>English</HI> Fleet. Most of the
Gentry and Nobility in this part of the Country, have Ha∣bitations
in this Town; they use few Coaches, but generally
ride in an open kind of Chariot, which defends them from
neither Wind nor Sun; the Carriages thereof are not slung
as in <HI>England,</HI> so that they are little better than a gilded
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Car: <MILESTONE N="June. 20. 1689."/> The Women appear very modestly (or rather un∣mannerly
Coy) not suffering a Man so much as to touch
their Hands, without shewing a dislike thereunto. This
Town is likewise famous for a Spin-house, in nature of a
<HI>Bridewell,</HI> which is for restraining of Burgermasters Daugh∣ters
which lead lewd lives, upon discovery whereof they
are confined to this house for a year and a day. And from
hence we were ordered to <HI>Breda,</HI> to joyn the Troop of
Guards formerly gone thither; in Obedience to which we
came back to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and began our Journey from thence
on the Twentieth, and in two days arrived at our Journeys
end, through a Country where to see a Stone is a Miracle; the
Land there seems lower than the Sea, and I do believe so it
is; for, half the Country would be overflown with the Sea;
were it not for a great Multitude of Windmills that are kept
constantly imploy'd in draining the Land by a pretty kind of
Stratagem. There are several Towns, and good Entertain∣ment
on the Road, wherein I observed no great Superstition
(wherewith <HI>Brabant</HI> is horribly pestered) save in the matter
of the Stork, which they account lucky both to particular
Persons and the publick State; they being possest with a
fond conceit, that they have a secret Instinct in them, which
teaches them to abhor Monarchy, and that therefore they
will breed no where but in a free State; and therefore they
build their Nests for them in the Tops of their Chimneys,
where they delight to breed. But if they chance to breed
on the Top of a Burgermasters Chimney, they will rather
choose to lose the benefit of the Fire-place, than disturb
this lucky Bird; the Laws of the Land Protect them, and
make it Penal to destroy them; for which there is a natural
reason, especially in a Country where Frogs and Toads do so
much abound, of which Vermin these Birds are great
destroyers: and of which sort of Vermin, and Provision
for the Storks, there is such plenty here, that if almost
all the Birds in the Air were Storks, they may be feasted in
<HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<HI>Breda,</HI> <MILESTONE N="June 23. 1689."/> When we arrived there, we were surprized to
ride over five or six Draw-Bridges, before we came to the
Town; as soon as you enter the Gates, which (if a Stran∣ger,
they will not suffer you to do without a great deal of
Caution) you are carry'd to the Governour, before whom
you must give an Account of your self: This is a large
orderly City, only that they are not so curious in their
Houses, as they are in other Parts of <HI>Holland,</HI> though clean∣ly
enough. It belongs entirely to the Prince of <HI>Orange:</HI>
It is so well fortified, both by Nature and Art, that 'tis
even impregnable, besides the Rampierts, which are all
arched underneath with a strong Brick Arch, and are raised
higher than the Houses of the Town, whereon is an Enne∣agon;
there are two Pair of Outworks, each encompassed
with a broad deep Water; on the Government of this Ci∣ty
do depend seventeen other Towns of Note in the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Brabant.</HI> This City was taken by a Wile from the
<HI>Spaniard,</HI> by King <HI>Williams</HI> Grand-Father; our King hath
a very fine Castle and Garden here. There is likewise a
very remarkable Steeple here, which is in height four hun∣dred
and thirty four Steps, all of carved Stone; wherein is a
delicate Ring of Bells, which chime every half hour, to
give notice of the Clocks going to strike, which strikes here
so often; these Bells will readily and sweetly chime to any
time. Near to the Top of this mighty Structure, in a
round Ball, liveth a Trumpeter and his whole Family, which
by reason of the height, seems to them that stand on the
Ground, to be no bigger than that you may grasp it in your
Arms: This Trumpeter is to sound every Night, after the
Gates are locked, to give an Account that the City is safe.
<MILESTONE N="27"/> On the Twenty seventh, the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> received a
Portent from Prince <HI>Waldeck,</HI> to march to the Army, which
was encamped at <HI>Perway;</HI> <MILESTONE N="28"/> accordingly on the Twenty eighth
we marched to a City called <HI>Lunehout.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lunehout,</HI> Here we were quartered at Country Hou∣ses,
it being the Custom of this Country, to give Free
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Quarters to the Souldiers on their March; <MILESTONE N="June 28 1689."/> but the Houses
were forsaken by the Inhabitants. In our March through
this Country, I observed that every little House had a
Hop-Garden belonging to it; <MILESTONE N="29"/> the next Day we marched to
<HI>Skell.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29"/><HI>Skell,</HI> Here I had the Opportunity of Waiting on the
Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Antwerp,</HI> This is reputed the chiefest Town in all
<HI>Flanders;</HI> the most beautiful, and the strongest situated;
for the better Defence whereof, there is a strong Cittadel,
formed with five Bastions; <MILESTONE N="July 1 1689."/> some of the Streets of this City
are sixty Paces broad; in the Middle of the great Street is
the Statue of our Saviour on the Cross, carved at large and
gilded; at the Entrance of the Gates, and Corners of eve∣ry
Street, is carved the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> with our Saviour in her
Arms, and at the Foot of them a Place to kneel and wor∣ship:
In this City are twenty five Colledges, Nunneries,
and Religious Houses: No Art can exceed the Curiosity of
the Jesuits Chappel in its Structure and Ornaments, which
is wainscoated with all sorts of Marble; the Roof is painted
by the best Hands: They were so free as to shew us all
their Riches, which they valued to two Millions: They
have for every Holy Day a several Skreen to draw before
their Altar, which is richly painted and embroidered; you
may go from hence to any Part of <HI>Holland</HI> by Water, so
you may to <HI>Brussels:</HI> Here is likewise a Nunnery furnished
with <HI>English</HI> Nuns, who appear extream Civil, but are great
Bigots in their Religion, and great <HI>Athenians,</HI> as to News:
From hence we went to <HI>Lire.</HI> <MILESTONE N="2"/> </P>
<P><HI>Lire,</HI> Which is Two Leagues from <HI>Antwerp:</HI> Here is a∣nother
<HI>English</HI> Nunnery. This Town is not very strong,
but is a good Market Town, where all Provisions are
plentiful and cheap; <MILESTONE N="3"/> next Morning we went to <HI>Reminian.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HI>Reminian,</HI> <MILESTONE N="July 3 1689."/> Here all the Habitations were forsaken in a
Country full of standing Corn, whose Soil is very fertile,
and all well tilled, yet we found a great Scarcity of all
manner of Provisions, which we supposed the Inhabitants
had withdrawn, by reason of the Army marching that way.
We are now come into the Land of Idolatry, where the
Images of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> St. <HI>Ann</HI> and the Cross are wor∣shipped
in every Grove, under every green Tree, and at e∣very
cross Way; the <HI>Canaanites</HI> could never arrive to a great∣er
pitch of Idolatry; so that this Land can be so fitly like∣ned
to nothing as to a Paradice inhabited with Devils;
and to say the truth, for their Complexion, the Inhabitants,
both Men and Women, may keep the Feinds Company, there
being no such ill-favoured megre Creatures in the whole
Universe, as are these <HI>Walloons,</HI> who speak a broken <HI>French;</HI>
it is true, you may meet with a Priest or a Bacon-headed
Friar here and there that looks pretty plump and fat, the
Mobile being a Kind of ill shap'd Monsters, starved there∣unto,
'tis supposed by the Covetousness of the Clergy, who
Lord it over these poor Creatures, and have engrossed to
themselves all the fine Houses and Habitations, and I suppose
all the Riches and Provisions in the Country: The next Day
we marched through <HI>Veltum</HI> to <HI>Bissen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bissen,</HI> <MILESTONE N="4"/> Here we had the Help of an Ale-house for our
Refreshment, which is all the Advantage we had beyond
our former Quarters, where we could get nothing for Love or
Money: <MILESTONE N="5"/> The next Day we marched through <HI>Lovaine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lovaine</HI> Is a large uniform plentiful City, whither all
the Gentry do repair from the Country, whilst the Army is
in the Field. Here are eighteen Colledges and Monasteries,
among which are all Orders of Monks and Fryers: In the
great Church of this Town (which is a very stately Stru∣cture)
is painted the whole Story of the Bible in the Glass.
There is likewise the Statue of our Saviour riding on an Ass.
This Church is much beautified with famous Sculptures▪
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
among the Colledges, <MILESTONE N="July 5. 1689."/> one of them is said to be of the most
antient standing of any in the World; which is all my short
Stay in this Place would suffer me to observe, we being to
march that Night to <HI>Gree</HI> and <HI>Bee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gree and Bee,</HI> The Country began to be dangerous;
the Bores or Peasants being so bloody, rude, and surly, that
as they find an Opportunity, they knock what Souldiers they
can on the Head, and butcher them, though they gain no∣thing
thereby but their Cloaths; as they did two of the
Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI>'s Regiment, which lurked behind us, and were
never heard of after; for which Reasons we encamped in a
Meadow that Night, and foraged our Horses, but could
get no Meat but what we brought from <HI>Lovaine:</HI>
 <MILESTONE N="6"/> Hence we marched the next Day to <HI>Perway,</HI> and joyned the
Army.</P>
<P><HI>Perway,</HI> Several Branches of the Army being not yet
come in. Here the Army was encamped in one Line, ha∣ving
fifteen great Cannon, twenty six of a lesser sort, and
twenty five small Field-Pieces, with four Mortars, and
thirty Tin Boats; all the Camp we found plenty enough
of every thing, there being store of Sutlers. <MILESTONE N="9"/> Here we
staid till the ninth, and then marched in two Lines, the Pio∣neers
having first cleared the Way for us to <HI>Sombreife.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sombreife,</HI> Here we encamped in two Lines, and
were joyned with some <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> which
to all appearance were stout likely Men. Here some of the
Lord of <HI>Oxford</HI>'s Regiment began to mutiny about their
Pay; whereupon one <HI>Boad,</HI> their Major shot, one of them
trough the Head, who died within three Days, which qui∣eted
the Mutiny, and the Major was justified by the Court
Marshal for what he did. Here several <HI>Irish</HI> Men amongst
the Foot, having conspired to go over to the <HI>French</HI> Army,
were discovered, and shot to Death by Order of Court Mar∣shal:
 <MILESTONE N="14"/> We were encamped here until the Fourteenth, and
then marched to <HI>Gerempont.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<HI>Gerempont,</HI> <MILESTONE N="July 14. 1689."/> Here we encamped in three Lines, two
of the Army, and one of the Baggage and Artillery; here
were great Parties commanded out every Night, and fre∣quent
Alarums, but nothing of Action, saving that a Party
of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> under the Command of a Lieutenant, run
away from a <HI>French</HI> Party, the Commander whereof, and
some of his Men were taken by another Party of ours;
but our Lieutenant that fled was shot, and every Tenth
Man of his Men was hanged by Order of Court Marshal.
At the Camp several Souldiers were by a Priest inveagled
to desert our Army and go over to the <HI>French,</HI> some where∣of
were taken in the Act, and shot, but the Priest made his
Escape. Here the Inhabitants of the Country removed what
they had into their Churches, or rather Temples of their
Gods, which alone are free from the Plunder of the Soul∣diers,
having this Motto on them (<HI>Altare Privilegiatum.</HI>)
They keep their Markets at their Churches on the Sab∣bath,
where we might have Champaign and Rhenish Wine
plenty. Hence I attended on the Duke to <HI>Charleroy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Charleroy,</HI> <MILESTONE N="17"/> Here I had the Opportunity of observing
the Strength of a most regular Fortification, which is ac∣counted
the Key of <HI>Flanders;</HI> it was two Leagues distant
from the Camp; in the Town was a strong Guard, and
on the Road to the Camp were placed several Guards.
This Place is memorable for nothing but that it is a good
Garrison, which was the Design the <HI>French</HI> King had in
building it: There is plenty of Meadowing about the
Town, which makes it a good Quarter for Horse, and the
neather part of the Houses of the Town are all Stables,
which occasions the uncleanliness of the Streets. The Go∣vernour
entertained the Duke (after the <HI>Spanish</HI> manner)
with all sorts of the best Wine, and rode with us round
the Walls, which are raised so high, that none of the Hou∣ses
appear to any Body without the City; at this Town I
observed a great Market of <HI>French</HI> Horses, which had been
lately taken from their Army, and here exposed to Sail by
Beat of Drum. At the Dukes Departure he was comple∣mented
with the Discharge of the great Guns round the
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
Walls. <MILESTONE N="July 19. 1681."/> Thus we returned to the Camp, where I was
commanded on a Party to <HI>Brussels,</HI> to guard our new Ac∣coutrements
to the Camp, which were come thither out of
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brussels,</HI> This City was twenty Miles from our Camp;
the Road lying through several great Woods, made our
Passage dangerous, and gave us reason to expect an Attaque
from a <HI>French</HI> Party which lay in Ambush for us, but missed
us. <HI>Brussels</HI> is large, but not very strongly fortified, there
being only a dry Foss round the Outworks; within it are a
hundred and twelve Churches and Chappels, among which
are an <HI>English</HI> Nunnery, and several other Religious Houses;
the private Houses and Streets are but too much furnished
with Images and Crucifixes, which are most devoutly wor∣shipped
by the Priest-ridden <HI>Mobile.</HI> The great Church
here is sumptuously adorned, the outer Isles being hung with
Tapestry and Arras, which are raised on three large Rows of
Marble Pillars, compiled aster the <HI>Dorick</HI> manner of Archi∣tecture;
the Rails, as you go up to St. <HI>Ann</HI>'s Altar, are
made of massie Silver, so are the Pillars of the Altar, of
which sort there are above a hundred in this Church, which
the Spectators may say do all vie with one another for
Beauty and Riches; all the Windows, which are very large
and splendid, are glazed with painted Glass; before these
Altars, some Ladies or other (blinded with Popish Zeal)
are constantly prostrate, so that all I can say on their Behalf,
is, that they look like Christians; the Men and Women
of this Town appearing much more gentile and fashionable
than those of <HI>Holland;</HI> whereof (on a fair Day) you may
see abundance in a Walk which is in an handsome, natural,
regular Grove, leading to the Governours Pallace, which is
likewise very great and splendid, having on one side thereof
an Exchange; about it are divers magnificent Statues, with
curious Gardens and Water-words; near the House is pitched
a Tent which was taken from the <HI>Bassa</HI> before <HI>Buda,</HI> it is ve∣ry
Noble and Rich, being all green Silk without, and fine
Damask within, the Lodging Apartment thereof being wain∣scoated.
In this Town is an <HI>English</HI> Academy, and before
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
it lie encamped a thousand Men, <MILESTONE N="July 19. 1689."/> commanded by Prince <HI>Vada∣mont,</HI>
for the better Security thereof: It is said that Camlets
and Lace are not cheaper in any part of the World than
here. The Inhabitants have good Opportunities of Education,
saving the Superstition of their wicked Religion, and are ex∣tream
civil to Strangers, provided they intermeddle not with
that. Here is a great Ordinary at two Guilders, which is
three Shillings four Pence <HI>English,</HI> where you may have ex∣cellent
Fare. Here is likewise a Market once a Week for
Dogs, which they harness, and draw with them (in small
Carts made for that purpose) their heaviest Lumber. Here
we staid till the Twenty fourth, when we returned with
our Accoutrements to the Camp, <MILESTONE N="25"/> and on the Twenty fifth,
marched with the Army, which encamped at <HI>Monstrea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monstrea,</HI> Here we encamped in four Lines, and
staid but one Night, the <HI>French</HI> having forraged all that
Country. <MILESTONE N="26"/> On the Twenty sixth we marched to <HI>Nevill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nevill,</HI> Here we encamped in an oblique Round, with
the Baggage and Artillery in the middle. Out of one of our
Parties, we lost a <HI>Dutch</HI> Major, and an <HI>English</HI> Lieutenant,
with five Men; and in the Action, took and killed about
fifty <HI>French<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> A <HI>Dutch</HI> (forraging) Party lost thirty Horses,
which were taken from them by the <HI>French.</HI> The Army
had great Out-guards, the <HI>French</HI> being round about them,
and the Country extream woody; for the Defence of this
Town, there is an old Fortification, with several round
Towers thereon, not very strong; in it is a very magnifi∣cent
Chappel, where Ladies of noble Descent, called <HI>Chan∣nonesses,</HI>
officiate instead of Priests: They have a notable
Knack of singing out their Devotion, wherein they are
accompanied with Flutes and Organs. They entertained
the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> with a Ball, and in Requital he treated
them with a Collation one Evening at the Camp; their Go∣verness
is a Princess, without whom they stir not abroad;
they keep their Coaches (some with six Horses) and live
very Court-like. None are admitted into this Society, but
such as can evidence their Extract to have been Noble for
thirteen past Generations together. They are all great
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
Fortunes, and sometimes change this Condition for a marri∣ed
State; <MILESTONE N="July 19, 1689."/> when they happen to do that, they leave a hun∣dred
Pound <HI>per Annum</HI> to the Society. When they are a
their Devotion, they wear a white Linnen Vest, over which
is a black Veil lined with Ermins, which trails; at other
times they dress well, are Beautiful, Civil and well Carri∣aged.
There are of this sort at <HI>Brussels</HI> and <HI>Monts,</HI> but are
not so strict; neither can they boast that their Societies are
so ancient as this. Hence we removed the First of <HI>August,</HI>
and encamped in four Lines at <HI>Tressinean.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tressinean,</HI> <MILESTONE N="August 1. 1689."/> Here is the curiousest Garden and Wil∣derness
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> embellished with many Rarities. The Gen∣tleman
to whom this Place belongs, is a Protestant; who
was so fond of his Fine Garden and his House, which is
likewise very considerable, that he gave all his Money and
Substance to the <HI>French</HI> Army, on condition that the Houses
and Gardens might be spared; by which means this sumptu∣ous
Structure alone hath escaped the Fury of the <HI>French</HI>
Army. At this Place some <HI>Lunenburghers, Brandenburghers,</HI> and
more <HI>Spaniards</HI> joyned us, which compleated our Army for∣ty
five thousand Men. The next Day we marched through a
very dangerous Pass, to <HI>Fountaine Laveck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fountaine Laveck,</HI> <MILESTONE N="2"/> This Town hath been well
walled, but is ruined, wasted, and decayed with the continual
Wars, which this idolatrous Country is subject unto; which
though as fertile a Soil, and as good a Climate as can be in
the World, is of no use to any, save only to quarrel in: the
Inhabitants, after never so much Labour and Industry imploy'd
to raise Cattle or Corn, being certain to be plundered of all
by one Army or other; it being but just, that God Almigh∣ty
should withhold from them the Blessing of Plenty and
Peace for their Idolatry. Here we were encamped in four Lines
thus, <FIGURE REND="inline">
</FIGURE> in a triangular piece of Ground, joyn∣ing
to the Town, where our chief Officers were Quarter∣ed;
till the Seventh, when we marched in four Lines over
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
the <HI>Scombre,</HI> <MILESTONE N="August 7. 1689."/> by the help of Bridges made on Copper
Boats; and about a Mile beyond the River in the County
of <HI>Leige,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Territories, we Encamped in two
Lines in a Strong place, the Rear of our Camp being Co∣vered
with a River and a steep Rock; the Place where
we Encamped was called <HI>Mashero Pont.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Marshero Pont,</HI> <MILESTONE N="7"/> Here we remained only one Night,
having sent our Pioneers (covered with a strong Guard) to cut
a Passage for our Army through the thick Forrest of <HI>Arden;</HI>
in the Action the <HI>French</HI> Attaqued them, but were repulsed
with a considerable loss; this Forrest is noted to be the
greatest Forrest in <HI>Europe,</HI> perhaps in the whole World;
beginning at <HI>Brabant,</HI> it runs up into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and is said
to be Eight hundred Leagues in length: On the Eighth
instant we Decamped and Marched to <HI>Hemsurry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hemsurry,</HI> <MILESTONE N="8"/> Here we were got three Leagues into the
<HI>French</HI> Territories, and within two Miles of the Body of
their Army, encamped in a Wood, with a Line of Cir∣cumvallation;
which is stronger in Horse than ours; but
ours stronger in Foot than theirs, and that conside∣rably:
At this Camp we intrench'd our selves, and one
of the <HI>French</HI> Lieutenants of Horse coming to view our
Camp, mistaking our Out-guards for his own, came into
hem, and was taken Prisoner. Sir <HI>Richard Brown,</HI>
was this day run through the Body by Lieutenant
Collonel <HI>Billensly,</HI> who was exasperated thereunto by
some passionate ill Language, which the other used, who
dyed on the spot, and was the next day buried in the Forrest.
On the Tenth, the <HI>French</HI> General sent a Trumpet to ours,
to desire the exchange of Prisoners. On the Eleventh we
sent our Forragers under the Cover of Five Thousand
Horse and Foot▪ to Forrage close by the Enemy; where∣upon,
the <HI>French.</HI> Army was alarumed and drew out▪ but
would not be invited to leave the Shelter of their Woods▪
There was that day some Pickeering, but little hurt done▪
and now we are resolved, since we cannot Attaque the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
Army by reason of the strong Situation of the Place
where they are Encamped, <MILESTONE N="Aug. 15. 1689."/> that we will eat up the Forrage
round about them, and so starve them out of their En∣trenchments.
Thus we spent our time till the Fourteenth,
when we marched forward to <HI>Bressea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bressea▪</HI> Here we saw their Army draw forth, but they
did not offer to Attaque us, though it was supposed the two
Armys would have had some brushing here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the <HI>French</HI>
Army having received some considerable fresh supplies out
of the Garrisons) but that Night we decamp'd; the <HI>French</HI>
did not expect we would march so soon, having newly en∣trenched
our selves, and our Pioneers for a colour: but we
cut a large Pace, through a great Wood, quite another
way; our Vant-guard took 12 of their Dragoons, and kil∣led
one. Several Diserters came in to us, on our March;
and in conclusion, we got beyond their Army, and march∣ing
over Boated bridges towards <HI>Phillipville,</HI> we encamped
on the <HI>15th.</HI> at <HI>Tillroy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Villroy,</HI> <MILESTONE N="15"/> Here we were strongly posted, having on the
Rear a River, with a steep Ascent on each side, and on the
Front some Villages and Shottoes, which we had garrisoned
among which was <HI>Wall-Court,</HI> to which all the Peasants
of the Country, to the Number of Five Thousand had
flocked, bringing with them all their Provision and Substance,
thinking thereby to secure themselves, under Cover of the
<HI>French</HI> Army; whose General had commanded the Inhabi∣tants
of the Country, not to sell any Provision to our Army,
on pain of Death, and burning their Houses, whereupon
all Provisions began to grow very scarce and dear; whereat
our General being enraged, sent two Regiments of <HI>Bran∣denburgh</HI>
Foot, to require admission into the Town, and
that they should bring their Provisions to the Camp, where
they should receive the utmost value for them, which if they
declined to do, he would batter the Town about their
Ears: <MILESTONE N="14"/> These Proposals were with reluctancy condescended
unto, and the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> accordingly posted in the Town.
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
<MILESTONE N="Aug. 15. 1689."/> This is the Walled Village which was (more superstitiously
than wisely) so vigorously Attaqued by the <HI>French</HI> Army, on
St. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s day, which is their Kings Birth day; out of a fond
conceit, that that day is always prosperous to their Arms;
which day being on the Sixteenth of this Instant, proved
the direct contrary, their rashness being the occasion of
the loss of most of the principal Officers of their Army,
besides 3000 Sentinels killed in the Field, and a number
wounded, with the loss of not above 50 or 60 on our side,
among which was only one Officer of Note, who was a
Major. The Engagement began on a Party of the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
who gave way on the first Charge; but, our <HI>English</HI> being
there also, who were the Guards (that day) for cover∣ing
the Forragers, on whom the Design of the <HI>French</HI> Army
chiefly was (and indeed if they could have passed that
Guard, they might have taken 5000 of them) they bore
the Brunt of the Battle, and by their bravery, gained the
advantage of the Gound; which if the <HI>French</HI> could have
got, they would have made use of it to our great da∣mage.
All this while the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> in <HI>Wall-Court,</HI> were
not idle, but received the Attaque made on them, with a great
deal of courage, committing a great slaughter on the Ene∣my;
who demonstrated a great deal of desperate va∣lour
to little purpose. This Rancounter lasted ten Hours, the
Cannons playing all that while on both sides; theirs did
us on mischief, but ours cut off several of their Horse, and
made Lanes through their Foot as they Retreated; which
they did not do, till they saw the <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment, and
the <HI>English</HI> Guards advance; whereupon they sounded a
Retreat, and sent to our General for leave to bury their
Dead; to which the General gave his consent, after having
taken from them 12 of their Cannon, not esteeming it advi∣seable
to follow Victory too far. In burying their dead they
had the Boars to assist them, for which reason, before we de∣camped,
the General ordered their Villages to be burnt,
and gave the Soldiers leave to Plunder their Churches,
wherein they found great Booty. The <HI>French</HI> Army is now
Encamped within a Mile of us, and our Advance-guards
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
can see their whole Camp. In the Fight, and after the Fight,
several Deserters came in to us, who gave us Account that
a Multitude of their best Officers were slain, and that
Marshal <HI>De Humiers,</HI> narrowly escaped; one of his Field
Officers being cut off by a Cannon Ball, whilst he was lean∣ing
on his Shoulder. Here we stay'd till the 19th, when
we Marched about two Leagues, designing to Encamp;
but the <HI>French</HI> being Encamped too near us, and the Place
of our Encamping, not strong, our General thought fit to
change his Measures, and so marched the Army three
Leagues further, that day, a Party of the <HI>French</HI> following
us, but at a great distance. Near our Camp we received an
Alarum, that the <HI>French</HI> were in the Rear of us; whereupon,
our General in half an hour put the whole Army into an
advantageous Posture to receive them; but finding the
Alarum to be false, and that it was only our own Rear
Guard; we Marched to our Camp, where we stay'd till
the 22th: And being informed, that the Enemy designed to
get betwixt us and <HI>Charleroy;</HI> having likewise Advice from
the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> not to Engage them, we Marched
early that Morning, without sound of Trumpet, or beat of
Drum, through a very thick Wood, having the Evening
before sent away our Cannon and Baggage toward the <HI>Som∣bruff,</HI>
after having forraged and ravaged, in the <HI>French</HI>
Territories. For three Weeks through this Wood the <HI>French</HI>
followed us; whereof having Advice, and finding a little
Plain in the middle of the Wood, our General there drew up
the Army, lined the Wood, Manned a Shottoe, and turned our
Cannons upon them; which their Out guards perceiving,
<HI>Wall-Court</HI> being fresh in their memory, they were per∣swaded
to be so Mannerly as to keep their distance. How∣ever,
we Marched in a retreating Posture, relieving their
Rear, every half hour; by this means, the <HI>English</HI> Guards,
who led the Van in Morning, Marched in the Rear
in the Afternoon: thus we Marched over the <HI>Som∣bruff</HI>
by the help of four Bridges, on Copper Boats, guarded
with Cannon; as soon as we got over, we Encamped at a
Place called <HI>Jollie,</HI> by the River side.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="11"/>
<HI>Jollie,</HI> <MILESTONE N="Aug. 22 1689."/> Here we stayed till the <HI>29th.</HI> but on the <HI>27th.</HI> in
the Morning, by break of day, the <HI>French</HI> having raised two
Batteries over Night, laid on us with ten Pieces of Cannon
of twenty four pound Ball from one Battery, and eight Pieces
of eighteen pound Ball, from the other Battery; but we
were prepared for them, and had provided sixteen Cannon
to play against them, which were managed so well, that we
did a great deal of Execution, both on their Battery, and
Guards, and Attendants: We killed three of their Eminent
Officers with one of our Balls, and found several of their
Horses next day dead, near the Batteries: Of our side, we lost
only two Men and a Woman; a Bomb fell among the Officers
of Colloner <HI>Hayle</HI>'s Regiment without doing any harm, the
Fuzze being stifled; two more fell in a Meadow near our
Guards, with the same success; there likewise fell two Hun∣dred
Balls among our Tents, which injured neither Man nor
Horse. All the prejudice done, was, that some of the Tents
were torn, among which the Duke of <HI>Ormonds</HI> was one; not∣withstanding
which, the Duke stood his ground (with
the Troop drawn up) for three Hours, in the heat of the
Cannon adoing, the General having forgot to send him
Orders to draw off, without which he was resolved, not to
quit his post: This sort of game lasted from four in the Mor∣ning
till eleven, during which space of time, the Cannons
never ceased playing. In the end we constrained them to
quit their Battery, and we returned to our ground again,
where we encamped that Night, and the next day we marched
to <HI>Moutaine Sur le Samberg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mountaine Sur Le Samberg,</HI> <MILESTONE N="28"/> Here we stayed till the <HI>2d.</HI>
of <HI>September,</HI> when we marched to our old Camp, called <HI>Vill
de Perway.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vill de Perway,</HI> <MILESTONE N="Sept. 2 1689."/> Here we were encamped in two Lines, for
two days, without any Action; The Weather being very
bad, many of our Men fell sick of the Flux, with eating of
Fruit, wherewith this Country doth much abound: By this
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
and other Accidents, <MILESTONE N="Sept. 19 1639."/> four Regiments of our <HI>English</HI> Foot,
and two of <HI>Dutch</HI> were so wasted, that it was thought fit to
send them to Winter Quarters, with Orders to send fresh
Forces, out of the Garrisons, where they were to quarter,
which Forces joyned us at <HI>Lombeck:</HI> On the <HI>5th.</HI> we marched
to <HI>Jonep.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jonep,</HI> <MILESTONE N="5"/> Here the Weather was likewise very bad, and the

stayed till the <HI>9th.</HI> and then marched to <HI>Notre Dame de

<P><HI>Notre Dame de Hall,</HI> <MILESTONE N="9"/> This is a large Town of good Trade,

3000 Horse out of his own Army, and pursued
them, who were followed by twice as many out-of our Ar∣my,
under the Command of <HI>Mouns. de Bee:</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI>
Lieutenant General, Prince <HI>Vademont,</HI> came up with some of
them, killed 120, and brought 60 Prisoners into <HI>Brussels,</HI>
with the loss only of three Men, the rest fled; whereupon
he returned to the Camp, where we remained till the <HI>19th.</HI>
when we marched to <HI>Enghien.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Enghien,</HI> <MILESTONE N="19"/> This Town belongs to the Duke of <HI>Arcourt</HI> and
Prince of <HI>Brand Rambourge,</HI> where he hath an extraordinary
Mansion-House, and sumptuous Garden; some say it is as fine as
<HI>Versailes,</HI> the Fame whereof hath brought several from <HI>Paris,</HI>
and other remote parts to see it; it is likewise said, that
the Prince, before the War raged so much, kept two Hun∣dred
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
Workmen all the Year imployed about it: <MILESTONE N="Sept. 2▪ 1689."/> The Garden∣plat
which is well walled about, cannot be less than three
Hundred Acres; in one part thereof is a small Deer-Park,
planted with several Groves, of divers sorts of pleasant
stately Trees, as Fir, Walnut, Chesnut, Spruce-Fir; in
the pleasure Garden are 52 small Statues in several Postures,
and eight very large guilded, besides what are in the Hedges,
which all run Water: There are Flower-Pots betwixt every
Statue; there are likewise four Houses of Waterworks; in
the middle of the Park of <HI>Mazes</HI> is a Fountain, in an Octo∣gon,
arched on sixteen Pillars about twenty Foot high; on
the Top are eight great Lions cut at large in Stone; under
the Freez are eight <HI>Caesars</HI> Heads; The Fountain is railed,
and banastered about with Marble; the bottom being flagged,
and the sides lined with the same, as are the other four Hou∣ses
of Waterworks: From hence you see eight great Walks,
with Elm Hedges very curiously cut: Joyning to which are
eight Labyrinths; on the side of the Walls are several regu∣lar
Groves, some in a Triangle, some in a Quadrangle: In
this Town are several Convents of <HI>Carmelites,</HI> and <HI>Capuchines:</HI>
Here is also a Nunnery, and a stately Church curiously

Nevertheless we remained encamped at this place, till the

we encamped in two Lines, Prince <HI>Vademont</HI>'s Army still
keeping the Right.</P>
<P><HI>Cambroug,</HI> <MILESTONE N="27"/> Here the <HI>French</HI> Army was encamped within a

fair play, need not want a delicate plain Champion Country
for it; there cannot be a pleasanter sort of a Country, and
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
more capable of Improvement in the World: <MILESTONE N="Sept. 27 1689."/> But the Inha∣bitants
are so given to Superstition, and Idolatry, that it is
impossible any thing should prosper where they are. From
our Camp might be seen eleven Churches, the Country being
wholly dedicated to Religious Houses, which cannot be ter∣med
any thing, so properly, as Nests of idle Idolatrous Peo∣ple,
blind Leaders of the Blind, to whom the rest of the In∣habitants
are all Slaves; if it were not so, and if it would
please God to bless them with Peace, it would certainly be
as pleasant, and plentiful, and perhaps as flourishing a Coun∣try,
as any in the whole World: The chief of these Irreli∣gious
Places, is the House from whence our Camp derives
its Name; it is walled round, situate in the midst of this
Plain by a River-side, 'twixt two of our Garrisons, <HI>Ath</HI> and
<HI>Monts.</HI> Within these Walls is a famous Chappel, joyning to
the Cloyster, adorned with admirable Carvings, and extra∣ordinary
Painting; in it are many rich Altars, which they
(at last) refused to let our Guards see, because, said they,
they have given Offence in not kneeling, at the lifting up
of the Host; but another Chappel they were admitted in∣to,
where (among other Fopperies and Trumperies) I ob∣served
a little Prayer, hanged up in Latin, to be learnt
of all that came thither to devotion; the Prayer was to this
effect, <HI>That it would please the Lady of</HI> Cambrogue, <HI>for the sake
of the five Wounds, which her holy Image suffered in that place, by
the hands of an unsanctified Jew, to grant five things; Namely,
that in the Hour of Death, they may not want the Company of a
Priest, whereby they may have the benefit of Auricular Confession,
Absolution, receiving the Sacrament, and being anointed with
Oil:</HI> This is a <HI>Carmelite</HI> Convent; They stamp little Medals
of Silver, and sell them to the People, whom they perswade,
shall by the wearing of them be kept from Sickness, Disa∣sters,
Infection, or any Power of the Devil: This I heard
one of them aver. In the larger of these two Chappels is a
great Marble Pillar, <MILESTONE N="Octob. 2 1899."/> much like the Cross in <HI>Coventry,</HI> with
all the Popes and Fathers of the Church, engraven on it:
There is likewise engraven, the Expiration of our Saviour
on the Cross, under which is drawn to the life two Priests,
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
laying him in his Grave, with Women weeping, all cut at
large, in Marble: Here are likewise several large Tombs;
one of them, which is indeed very rich, belongs to the Fami∣ly
of <HI>Enghion;</HI> others lye in Arches in the Wall, cut at large,
(impailed) in Iron grates; which though of stone, are very
much defaced: which puts me in mind of <HI>Juvenal,</HI> who says,
That the very Marble Statues, and Monuments must yield to
the corroding Nature of Time, and pay a Tribute to Death.
It is said, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Army being about to
be betrayed into the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> by the treacherous
contrivance of these Fryars, he let his Soldiers plunder the
Church and take away all they had, whereof there is now no
sign, they having since admirably enriched themselves. Du∣ring

Out-works, answerable to every Bastion; It is Pallisadoed and
Stakudoed with Turrets on the Walls, whereon are Golden

irregular, and stronger by Nature than Art: It is surround∣ed
with a Wall, whereon are old-fashioned Turrets, notwith∣standing
which, the Situation of the place makes it really
admirably Strong. The <HI>French,</HI> in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Seconds
time, laid Siege to this Town, but were beaten from it by
the powers of the renowned Earl of <HI>Ossory.</HI> Within this
Town (on an hight) is Built a very high Piramid, whence
is a very great prospect, they say for Seven Leagues round:
On the top are Five round Turrets which are made use of
for Prisons; it is all Built of Carved stone: This Town lies
to the East End of the aforesaid place, and is from our Camp
Four Leagues; in it are several Churches, Monasteries, Nun∣neries,
and other Religious Houses; there are Two very
magnificent Churches, one of the Canons, the other of the
Canonesses; the latter is in every particular much after
the nature of them at <HI>Neville,</HI> but the Church is much more
a splendid Church, and most of the Ladies are related to
the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> King <HI>William,</HI> or Sisters to some of the
<HI>German</HI> Princes: Here Count <HI>Horne</HI> invited the Duke to a
Ball, where the Canonesses after Evening Service, Danced
(at their own House) with the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> and his Re∣tinue.
These Ladies meddle not with Consecrating the Sa∣crament,
which is left to the Priest. There occurred unto
me here a Superstitious Ceremony, namely, the carrying of
the Host in Procession, attended with Organs, Voices, and
other Musick playing all the way, whilst Priests went with
their Incense-pots fuming before it; it exceeds any <HI>Opera,</HI>
which is a shew they much admire in these parts: In this
Church is placed on a Pedestal in the middle of the Isle,
the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> Crowned, with our Saviour
in her Arms likewise Crowned; she is Apparelled in a fine
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
Cloth of Silver Gown, <MILESTONE N="Octob 4. 1689."/> and every one that comes thither to
Worship, makes a low bow to the ground, and kisses the
Hem of her Garment. After all this view of their Churches,
which strive every way to exceed one the other in Beauty and
Riches, wherein they come pretty near one the other, ex∣cept
that of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which exceeds the rest; I can only
lament that such Noble Structures should be dedicated to
Idolatrous uses. On the <HI>5th.</HI> we turned back to <HI>Combrogue,</HI>
where we remained as long as we could get any Forrage,
which was all devoured for Twenty Miles round, betwixt
the <HI>French</HI> Army and ours, I believe I may say Forty Miles,
without any great mistake; at last there grew a real scarci∣ty
of Horse meat. On the <HI>6th.</HI> Ten of the Grenadeers belong∣ing
to our Guard, unadvisedly went a Forraging without a
Convoy; Three of them were killed by the <HI>French,</HI> Five ta∣ken
Prisoners, and Two escaped without Horses or Coats,
which they had pulled off to work and make up their Trusses.
The Peasant that belonged to the House where they For∣raged,
brought the <HI>French</HI> upon them; but this action was
sufficiently revenged on the <HI>French,</HI> by the <HI>Lunenburghers,</HI> who
being a Forraging with their Carbines only, were set upon
by some <HI>French</HI> Soldiers disguised in <HI>Boors</HI> Frocks, but they
received them so warmly, that they killed Eight and twenty
of them, and took about Seventy Prisoners, with very little
loss. The day before we went to <HI>Monts,</HI> we marched a De∣tachment
of Eight thousand Men towards the <HI>French</HI> Camp,
together with Ten pieces of Cannon; when we came near
their Out-guards, we sent a Lieutenant of Horse with Thir∣ty
men to Fire on them, which he did, but they stirred not,
neither returned their Fire: It was near a Wood, where it
is supposed they had an Ambuscado, and thought to tra∣pan
us; however this Alarum was so great a surprize unto
them, that several of their Sutlers run away from them,
and several of their Officers sent away their Baggage: We
waited about Ten hours there to invite them to Engage
fairly, but they declined it; the next day they Decamped
and marched towards <HI>Tourney</HI> in order to send their Troops
to Winter Quarters, and in a few days after we began to
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
disperse our Army to the Frontier Garrisons, to wit, <HI>Ath,
Monts, Maestricht, Gaunt, Charleroy, Brussels,</HI> &amp;c. in con∣clusion
we marched towards <HI>Nevil,</HI> where we were discharg∣ed
at <HI>Nevil,</HI> on the when the Duke took his leave in
order to go for <HI>England,</HI> and the next day we marched, having
free Quarters all the way to <HI>Breda,</HI> to Winter Quarters;
where we arrived on the Twenty fourth, <MILESTONE N="24"/> and met with an
account that the Granadeers who were taken by the <HI>French,</HI>
had made their escape to <HI>Newburgh,</HI> where they are taken up
as Deserters; but we have sent for them, and in a short time
do expect them with us, where we now remain laid up for
the next Campain.</P>
