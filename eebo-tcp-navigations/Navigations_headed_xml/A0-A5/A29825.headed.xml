<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving given the English World an Account of some remote and seldome travelled Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the Year, 1673. I remained indifferent, as to the publishing any thing more, concerning nearer, or bet∣ter known places; a great part whereof hath been delivered by some good, and observing Writers; upon which conside∣ration, though written some years since, these Papers have not come abroad, and had still remained private, had not the desires of Friends solicited this Publica∣tion, and also a Promise in my former Book oblig'd me to say something of <HI>Vi∣enna;</HI> as likewise my Journey unto that Place from <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>Belgian Pro∣vinces</HI>
<PB REF="3"/> and <HI>Germany;</HI> and of my Return from <HI>Vienna</HI> by <HI>Austria Trans-Danu∣biana, Moravia, Bohemia, Misnia, Saxonia,</HI> unto <HI>Hamburg;</HI> hereof I have therefore given some Account in this Work, not much engaging into the Policy and State Government of Places, which have been so largely delivered, as to make up just Volumes, but have rather set down what is Naturally, Artificially, Histori∣cally, and Topographically remarkable; together with some Customes and Occur∣rencies which might be acceptable unto the Inquisitive Reader, or serve as hints of further Enquiry, to such Persons as may hereafter Travel into those Parts.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM NORWICH TO COLEN in <HI>GERMANY.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the year 1668. I left the large and pleasant City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and went by land to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> a Port Town in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> at the mouth of the River <HI>Hierus</HI> or <HI>Yare;</HI> large, fairly built and populous, very considerable for the great Herring fishing in the Au∣tumn, and the commerce it maintain∣eth in the Streights; <HI>Baltick, British</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Seas: With <HI>Italians, French, Spaniards, Dutch, Danes,</HI> and <HI>Swedes.</HI> I was here nobly entertained by that worthy and obliging person, Sr. <HI>Iames Iohnson,</HI> who also fur∣nish't me with letters of Credit, to <HI>Amsterdam, Franck∣fort, Venice</HI> and <HI>Vienna;</HI> Whereby I was readily and handsomely accommodated in all Parts where I had af∣terwards occasion to travel.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
<P><HI>August</HI> the 14. about six a clock at night I went a∣board the <HI>Angel-Ketch</HI> in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road, a Vessel of a∣bout 55 Tuns, and we immediately set sayl for <HI>Rotter∣dam;</HI> we left St. <HI>Nicholas-Sand</HI> on the Larboard, and after that the <HI>Nowles,</HI> a new Sand, not taken notice of to be raised above twelve years before. We kept our course all night, East and by South and East South East. The Sea burned at the head of the Ship at the beginning of the night, but the Moon rising there appeared nothing but froth. In the morning we discovered <HI>Gravesandt</HI> Steeple. It is the custom upon all this coast to send out Pylot-boats continually to meet all Ships at Sea, and furnish them with Pylots to bring them through the sands, and no Ship is to refuse one: Having taken in our Pylot, we soon discovered <HI>Goréé</HI> Steeple, and then the <HI>Briel.</HI> We entred the River <HI>Mosa,</HI> or <HI>Maes,</HI> a Large and noble Stream, which arising in the Mountaines of <HI>Vauge,</HI> or <HI>Vogesus,</HI> passing by <HI>Verdun, Dinant, Namur, Liege, Maestricht, Ruremond, Venlo,</HI> and many considerable Places, doth here fall into the Ocean, we had a very pleasant passage up the River, sayling by many neat Vil∣lages, as <HI>Maese-sluys, Schedam, Delfshaven,</HI> and hand∣some rowes of Trees upon the shore, and arrived at <HI>Rot∣terdam</HI> about six at night. This is one of the three chief passages by Sea into <HI>Holland,</HI> the other being by <HI>Flushing</HI> and the <HI>Texell.</HI> The nearest cut out of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> into <HI>Holland</HI> is from <HI>Laistoffe</HI> Point to <HI>Grave∣sandt,</HI> which is 28 Leagues, and the deepest part of the Sea is about 28 Fathoms. There lay two of the grea∣test Ships in <HI>Holland</HI> at that time near <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> the <HI>Crane</HI> and the <HI>Wassenaer;</HI> this latter built in lieu of that in which Admiral <HI>Opdam</HI> was blown up, fighting against his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>Yorke.</HI> The Heads or Keyes between which we entred the towne by water are
<PB N="3" REF="4"/> handsome, and Ships of great burden are received into the middle of divers streets without difficulty, (their Channels being deep and large) the houses are well built, and the town Populous, they have an Exchange or place for Merchants to meet at, the streets are so clean that the Women goe about in white Slippers, they being paved with Bricks laid edgwise. The <HI>Landthuise</HI> hath a fair front. In the great Church the Organs, the Tower and the Monument of <HI>De wit,</HI> upon the Bridge the Statue of <HI>Erasmus,</HI> as also the house where he was born, and the Pleasure boats of the States are worth the seeing. It be∣ing then the time of their <HI>Kermis</HI> or Faire, there were playes acted and many rarities shewn, as <HI>Lions, Leopards,</HI> &amp;c, and a great noise was made about a tall Woman to be shewn of seven foot high; but the Boor of <HI>Leckerkir'k,</HI> not far from this town, was higher. <HI>Parsons</HI> and <HI>Evans,</HI> porters to King <HI>Charles</HI> the first, did also exceed her, but I have seldom heard of any that was taller than <HI>Martin Wierwski</HI> a Polander, who at the age of forty two years was presented to the Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> the second, as a rarity of nature, and was full eight foot high, whose picture, as big as the life, I saw, near to the <HI>Franciscans</HI> Con∣vent at <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Rotterdam</HI> I passed by <HI>Overschee</HI> to <HI>Delft,</HI> by the Powderhouse, which is a handsome one, built now at some distance from the towne to prevent the like acci∣dent which befell when the former took fire and blew up part of the town. The <HI>Piazza</HI> or market-place is a very fair one, having the front of the town house at one end of it, and the high steeple of the new Church at the o∣ther. In the old Church, <HI>Van-Tromps</HI> Tombe is very well carved upon the side of the Wall, himself lying up∣on a Canon encompassed with Arms and trophies. In the middle Isle of the new Church there is a noble
<PB N="4" REF="5"/> monument, the Tombe of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassaw</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> together with his Wife and Son, Prince <HI>Maurice;</HI> his <HI>Statua</HI> is in armour with his Dog at his feet, and four Obelisks are supported by ten Marble pillars. In a house of this Town there were shewn me in a Wall the marks of the bullets shot at Prince <HI>William,</HI> who was thereby murthered 1584. and in another Church which was broad and spacious I saw a handsome Tomb for Sr. <HI>Charles Morgans</HI> Lady, and the Monument of <HI>Peter Hein</HI> the Admiral, who took the <HI>Spanish</HI> Silver∣sleet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hague, Haga Comitis,</HI> the ancient place of Resi∣dence of the Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> and now of the States ge∣neral; is about an hours-going distant from <HI>Delft;</HI> in which passage, at some distance, we had a sight of two of the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> houses. This place is well built; the Prince's Court handsome; The <HI>Piazza</HI> by it full of green trees; many fair Houses. The Course where the Coach∣es meet, the Pall-mall, the Wood, the Park, do much beautifie it, and the way from hence to <HI>Scheveling,</HI> from whence his Majesty returned into <HI>England,</HI> is very remark∣able, it being a streight way cut through the Sand-hills, and paved with Brick for three miles, having on each hand four or five rows of Trees, and <HI>Scheveling</HI> Steeple at the end of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hague</HI> and <HI>Mad rid</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> are accounted the greatest Villages, or open unwalled places, in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have thought it more honour to be Masters of the greatest Village, than of a place which, if it were walled, would come short of many Cities; but this may prove a dangerous resolution, for formerly upon this ad∣vantage, <HI>Martin van Rossem,</HI> Captain to the Duke of <HI>Gueldres,</HI> sacked the <HI>Hague;</HI> and it was lately in the like danger when the <HI>French</HI> Forces lay at <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Wor∣den,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/> if they had forced a passage into that part of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leyden</HI> is three hours or three <HI>Dutch</HI> miles from the <HI>Hague,</HI> at present one of the nearest Towns in <HI>Europe;</HI> Well built, hath divers large Streets, beautified with rowes of Trees, and the water passing through the middle of them, and also well fortified after the modern way; I took notice of that Antiquity called <HI>Hengist</HI> Castle, or the <HI>Berg,</HI> said to be built by <HI>Hengist</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and went up to the top thereof: Upon the top there is now an Arbour, and a Maze or Labyrinth round it, and a Well, out of which, they told us, they took a Fish alive when the Town was almost famished during the siege, which was shewed to the Enemy over the wall, endeavouring to make their condition to appear better than it was, and to dishearten the besiegers. There are now handsome stairs from the top to the bottom, and a good house built by it, where they have their publick sales and en∣tertainments. But a nobler Antiquity lieth under the Sea, than any above ground; not far from hence near <HI>Calwyck</HI> is a square fortress called <HI>Arx Britannica,</HI> built by <HI>Caligu∣la;</HI> in the declining of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire ruined in part by the <HI>Normans,</HI> and afterwards neglected, &amp; over whelm∣ed by the Sea. But in some years, and great retire of the Sea, the ruines have been discovered, and many no∣ble Antiquities brought from it, some having this in∣scription <HI>Ex. Ger. Inf. ex Germania inferiori.</HI> The <HI>Stadthuise</HI> hath a fair front towards the street. In the Anatomy Schools are a very great number of <HI>Skeletons.</HI> Two legs of an <HI>Elephant.</HI> The <HI>Skeleton</HI> of a young <HI>Whale,</HI> of a <HI>Horse, Deer, Cow, Cat, Fox,</HI> and many other Animals; divers <HI>Skeletons</HI> of Men and Women, some bodies preserved with their Muscles, and one intire, the flesh, skin and all parts defended from corruption. I saw also here what Monsieur <HI>de Bils</HI> pretended towards
<PB N="6" REF="6"/> the preservation of Bodies, but more accurately after∣wards at Dr. <HI>Ruisch</HI> his house at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> The Physick-garden, although but small, is well filled with Plants, where are also many other both natural, and artificiall Curio∣sities to be seen, and many sorts of <HI>Optick glasses.</HI> Near the garden are the Schools built of Brick with the <HI>Officina Elzeviriana</HI> on the top. In the Churches I saw the Monuments of many famous men. There is a Picture in the Chamber for the Burgermasters, represent∣ing the day of Judgment, drawn by <HI>Lucas van Leyden,</HI> so much esteemed that, it is said, the Emperour <HI>Ru∣dolphus</HI> would have given for it as many Ducats of Gold as would have covered it. The Table also upon which <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> wrought whilst he was a Taylor, is a Curiosity, because he proved afterwards so considerable a disturber of <HI>Germany,</HI> and came to be King of the <HI>Anabaptists.</HI></P>
<P>This City endured a hard siege by the <HI>Spanish</HI> forces, and they were reduced unto great extremity, but they saved themselves by overflowing the Country, and so forcing the Enemies to make away with great loss; and afterwards coyned a memorial-Medall with this Inscrip∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>Ut Senacherib à</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>sic Hispani a Leydae noctu fu∣gerunt.</HI> 1574.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leyden</HI> I came to <HI>Haerlem,</HI> a neat City, plea∣santly seated and having a Grove near it. The great Church is esteemed the largest in <HI>Holland,</HI> with a very high Lanthorn upon it. Within are many Inscriptions and Monuments, most of which are transcribed and set down in <HI>Gotfr. Hegenitii Itinerarium Hollandicum.</HI> In the Prin∣ce's house are all the Earles of <HI>Holland</HI> Painted upon the wall, and in the Garden in the Summer-house, the Pict∣ure of <HI>Laurentius Costerus,</HI> who is said to have first in∣vented the art of Printing in this Town; but others attri∣bute
<PB N="7" REF="6"/> it to <HI>Johannes Gottenberg,</HI> a <HI>German.</HI> On the o∣ther side there is a Picture of a Ship with Saws, in memo∣ry of the manner how <HI>Damiata</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> was formerly ta∣ken by those of this Town, who, as they report, accom∣panied <HI>Frederick Barbarossa</HI> in an expedition against the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and when the men of <HI>Pelusium</HI> or <HI>Damiata</HI> had chamed up their Port, by this invention of fastning strong Saws to the keels of their Ships, they cut the chains in sunder, and so took the Town. In the rooms are very good Paintings by <HI>Hemskerk,</HI> and <HI>Goltzius,</HI> as his <HI>Prometheus</HI> and other Peeces; but <HI>Cornelius van Haerlem</HI> most delighted me, in his peeces of <HI>Herods</HI> kil∣ling the Innocent Children; his feast of the Gods, in which <HI>Vulcans foot</HI> is esteemed at a great rate; and ano∣ther Picture of a Frier and a Nun at a Collation, not inse∣riour to the rest.</P>
<P>The old Mens house, or an Hospital for sixty aged persons, is large and handsome; having a good Qua∣drangle and a Garden in it. The Hospital also for the sick is very cleanly kept.</P>
<P>Here I first saw the manner of punishing Malefact∣ours by whipping them with rods, which is more se∣vere than I imagined; they lead them to a Post upon a scaffold, their hands tyed and by a pully drawn up as high as they can be extended, and then an Iron fastned a∣bout their wast to keep them steady; in which stretched∣out posture they receive sometimes fifty or sixty stripes or more, according to the merit of their offence.</P>
<P>Not far from this place there is a great Water, or no∣ted Lake called <HI>Haerlem Meere</HI> about twenty miles in length, which is frozen over in hard Winters, and men swiftly travel over it by sliding, or in sleds. When <HI>Haer∣lem</HI> was besieged there was a Naval sight upon it; The <HI>Dutch</HI> having about an hundred and fifty Vessels, and the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/> <HI>Spaniards</HI> not many fewer. The Town was afterwards taken by Composition, but such cruelty was used by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that they have not yet forgot it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Haerlem</HI> I went to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a City at pre∣sent for Riches, Trade, Shipping, fair Streets, and pleasant habitations, scarce yielding to any other of the World. It is seated upon the River <HI>Ye,</HI> and hath its name, as 'tis reported, from a Castle appertaining long since to the Lords of <HI>Amstel,</HI> to whom this place also belonged: At the beginning, the seat of a few fishermen; but after∣wards increasing, it received many priviledges from the Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was made a Town or City by the favour of their Grants and Charters. In the year 1470. it was walled about with a Brick-wall, to defend it a∣gainst the Citizens of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> they having been in great danger to have fallen into their hands, if those of <HI>Utrecht</HI> had pursued their victories. In few Months after also, the whole Town was almost reduced to Ashes by fire, but by the increase of their Traffick they easily overcame these losses, waded through all difficulties, and rendred good services to their Counts, and received the honour afterwards from <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperour to have the Imperiall Crown over their Armes, which are three <HI>Cros∣ses</HI> on a <HI>Pale</HI></P>
<P>About the year 1525. <HI>Gelen,</HI> sent from the new King of <HI>Munster,</HI> passed through <HI>Friesland</HI> and came to this City; where having made a party, and communicated his de∣sign, he resolved to surprize the Town by night, at the time of the sounding of the Bell; to which intent they were already entred the Market place, had set upon the Town house: and cut in pieces those who resisted them. When by great providence the rope to the great Bell was taken away; the Magistrates had notice of it, and caused all the streets and Avenues leading to the Market-place to
<PB N="9" REF="7"/> be stopped up with Woolsacks and Hopsacks, whereby they were hindred in their design of taking the Town by night, and the next morning their number being discover∣ed to be inconsiderable, they were set upon, driven into the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> and defeated.</P>
<P>Of late years this City is mightily encreased and en∣compassed with a new Wall, and fortified after the modern way. The new Streets are large and uniform: and the whole Town being in a low Marshy ground, the water is let in through all the considerable Streets. The River <HI>Amstel</HI> passeth through the City, being let in under a handsome well-contrived Bridge of Eleven Arches, which is so built as to make part of the Wall and Rampart, and is 26 paces broad. The whole Town is built upon Piles, or high Firr-trees, driven down perpendicularly into the Earth so thick together, that nothing more can be forced in between them: And by this means they build Houses in the Sea, and lay Foundations strong enough to support the greatest Buildings whatsoever, in places where no solid bottom is to be found. But they must needs be at a great expence and labour before they can lay the first Stone: And the number of Trees required to each Foundation is considerable; since for the Foun∣dation of one Tower or Steeple alone, over against the Church of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> Mr. <HI>J. de Parivall,</HI> who wrote <HI>Les Delices de la Hollande,</HI> reckoneth that there was ram∣med into the ground a <HI>Forrest,</HI> as he calls it, of Six thou∣sand three hundred and thirty four great Trees. About this manner of work, for the fixing their Foundations, I saw them employed in divers places, particularly at the <HI>East-India-house,</HI> and at a place where a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church was then designed to be built, So that it was not improbably said, <HI>That if a man could see all under this City, he could hardly behold a greater Forrest.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<P>The <HI>Stadthuis</HI> or <HI>Town-house,</HI> is the noblest Building in all these Countries. A Pile of Freestone of an hundred and ten paces in Front, being larger than the Magnified Front of the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> and eighty one paces deep, or on the sides. The Chambers in it, the Pictures and Statues, are worthy to be seen and admi∣red. The first Room on the right hand, or <HI>Judgment∣hall,</HI> where the Malefactors receive their Sentence, is a∣dorned with large Statues, hanging down their heads in mournful postures, as if concerned or grieving at what was then pronounced. The Floors are of Marble; the Roofs are richly gil't and painted. Upon the top of all stands <HI>Atlas</HI> or <HI>Columlus,</HI> holding a Globe upon his shoul∣der made of Copper, of about ten foot Diameter, which is as large perhaps as any Ball or Globe whatsoever em∣ployed to this ornamental use. That upon St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> as having been in it, I judge to be less; as like∣wise that at <HI>Florence.</HI> The <HI>Turkish</HI> Ornament to the Tower of their <HI>Mosques,</HI> is three Balls one above another, and an half Moon over them, but they are less by far, at least such as I have seen: and by relation from Eye-wit∣nesses, the largest of the three noble gilded Balls at <HI>Mo∣rocco</HI> are inferiour to this. But I will say nothing more of this great building, the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> since there is a peculiar description of it in Folio, with Cuts and Figures of the most remarkable Curiosities in it. The <HI>Exchange</HI> is fair and large, and above it are Shops: it is very well frequented, and he that cometh after twelve payeth six stivers.</P>
<P>Divers of their Churches are fair: In the new Church, the partition with Ballisters of Brass, and the carved Pul∣pit, are noble. In the old Church the Tomb of <HI>Van Hulse</HI> and <HI>Heemskerk</HI> are remarkable. <HI>Heemskerk</HI> did his Country great Services in their first attempts upon <HI>In∣dia:</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/> for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> having consiscated some of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Ships, who traded to his Dominions, which were then the Staple for the <HI>India</HI> Trade. It was resolved by the permission of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> and the States, to set out a Fleet of eight ships for the <HI>Indies;</HI> four of which were to pass by the way of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and the Cape of <HI>Good-hope:</HI> And the other four were to search a passage towards the Kingdoms of <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>China</HI> by the North-east, whereby the passage also into those parts might be expected much shorter than that which was known to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>To this intent these four last vessels sailed out of the <HI>Texel, June</HI> 5. 1594. and returned in <HI>September,</HI> not be∣ing able to proceed by reason of the Ice. But upon the relation of the Voyage by <HI>William Barenson,</HI> there were two other Expeditions afterwards to <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> in the last of which they wintered there, and <HI>Barenson</HI> lost his life. <HI>Heemskerk</HI> was the chief of the twelve which returned from that cold habitation, where none but Bears and Foxes could well endure the Winter, where he had been twice, and afterwards made two rich Voyages into <HI>India.</HI> Upon whose happy returns the <HI>Holland East-India</HI> Company was first established, and a prohibition made for any other of that Country to trade thither for the space of One and twenty years.</P>
<P>But to proceed to other publick Buildings in this Ci∣ty. The <HI>Tuchthuis</HI> or <HI>Raspelhuis,</HI> or House of Correction for debauched young men, such as are incorrigible and dis∣obedient to Parents or Laws, hath at the entrance of the Gate two Lions bridled, a proper Embleme, with this Inscription, <HI>Virtutis est domare quae cuncti pavent.</HI> This was formerly a Monastery belonging to the Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Clare,</HI> and converted to this use 1595. They who are put in, are forced to work and gain their Bread
<PB N="12" REF="9"/> with hard labour. I saw those who rasped <HI>Brazil,</HI> having a certain task set them every day, work so hard, that be∣ing naked and in a sweat, and the dust of the <HI>Brazil</HI> wood flying upon them, they were all over painted of a beau∣tiful red colour. Which odd sight made me call to mind the Phansie of my Lady Marchioness of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> of a Nation wherein the People were of Orange-tawny colour, and the King of Purple.</P>
<P>They told us that some that were committed to their charge, and not to be brought to work by blows, they placed in a large Cistern, and let the water in upon them; placing only a Pump by them for their relief, whereby they are forced to labour for their lives, and to free themselves from drowning. One we saw put into a narrow Dungeon, and kept from meat. Some are put into this House for a longer time, some for a shorter. It hath been a punishment for such as have drawn their Daggers, or offered to stab any one. And some Citizens, though able and rich enough, contrive it so, that when their Sons are extravagant and masterless, the Officers seize upon them, and carry them into this House, where they are not forced to any hard labour, but kept in till they see suf∣ficient signs of a mending their life.</P>
<P>This way of Correction may seem severe to many, yet is not comparable to that which is said to have been for∣merly used in <HI>Germany.</HI> Particularly at <HI>Colen,</HI> in the <HI>white Tower,</HI> at the North end of the Town, near the <HI>Rhine;</HI> where it is reported, that such Youths who were not otherwise to be reclaimed, were in a barbarous manner shut up in the <HI>white Tower.</HI> The height and thickness of the walls secured them from escaping, or from their complaints being heard. Near the top was placed out of their reach a loaf of bread, the last remedy against starving, which while their bold necessity forced
<PB N="13" REF="9"/> them to reach at, they executed their last sentence upon themselves, and miserably brake their own necks.</P>
<P>Somewhat like the <HI>Raspelhuis</HI> is the <HI>Spinhuis,</HI> or House of Correction, for the young women who live loosely, are taken in the night, or can give no account of their living. They are put in for a certain time, according as their fault meriteth, and are bound to make lace, sew, or employ their time perpetually in some honest labour.</P>
<P>Those of the better sort are permitted to have Cham∣bers apart. In one large Room I saw about an hundred of them, and some very well dressed and fine, which was an unexpected sight to me, and would sure be more strange to behold in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Weeshuis,</HI> or Hospital for Children, where there are Six hundred Orphans carefully looked after, and well educated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolhuis,</HI> or a House for such as are Delirious, Ma∣niacal, or Melancholical of both Sexes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gasthuis,</HI> or Hospital for the Sick, being large, and hath a great Revenue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mannenhuis,</HI> or Hospital for old Men, and such as are no longer able to labour towards their own sup∣port.</P>
<P>Besides all which, there are great Sums of mony col∣lected for the poor, so that there is not a Begger to be seen in the Streets, and upon all assignations or appoint∣ments of meeting at the Tavern, or elsewhere, and upon many other occasions, whosoever faileth to come at the exact time, forfeiteth more or less to the use of the Poor.</P>
<P>The <HI>East-India-houses</HI> are remarkable, and the great Stores of their Commodities, <HI>Cinamon, Green-ginger, Camphire, Pepper, Calecuts, Indico, &amp;c.</HI> The ships are of a great burden: their House was then enlarging, although
<PB N="14" REF="10"/> it was great before; and a perfect Town for all Trades within it self.</P>
<P>The <HI>Admiralteyt,</HI> or Admiralty where their Stores for War and Shipping are laid up, is encompassed with wa∣ter; near to it there lay then 72 Men of War. In the House we saw their Cables, Grapling irons, Pullies, Oars, Char∣ges for Powder, Lanthorns for ships, &amp;c. At the en∣trance of the Gate hangeth up a <HI>Canoe</HI> with a man in it, dryed up, so as to be preserved from corruption, and a Paddle in his hand: he was enclosed up to the waste in the <HI>Canoe,</HI> in such sort, as the Fish-skins, which were the cover to it, being so sewed together that no water could get in, he might keep the Sea in the greatest Storms with∣out danger. The top of this House, as of divers others also in this City, is a Reservatory for Rain-water, which they have the more need of, because they have little good water hereabouts.</P>
<P>The fairest Streets in the Town are <HI>Harlem-street,</HI> the <HI>Cingel, Princes Graft, Kaisers Graft,</HI> and the New Build∣ings in the Island towards <HI>Gottenburg.</HI> And if they con∣tinue to build with Freestone, they will still surpass these, which, I'le assure you, are in no small measure beauti∣ful.</P>
<P>I saw a Globe to be sold, made by <HI>Vingbomes,</HI> between six and seven foot Diameter, valued at Sixteen thousand Guldens: The Meridian alone, being of brass, cost a thousand Guldens. The Globe is made of Copper-plates excellently well painted, with all the new Discoveries in it, as that of <HI>Anthony Van Dimons</HI> Land, found out 1642. in 42 degrees of Southern Latitude, and 170 of Longitude, those towards the Northwest of <HI>Japan,</HI> and those places both about <HI>N. Z.</HI> and also in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Sea beyond the Streights of <HI>Voygats, New-Holland, West-Friesland, Cape d'Hyver, &amp;c.</HI> but I have since met with a Book, which
<PB N="15" REF="10"/> doth somewhat contradict this; entituled <HI>A Voyage into the Northern Countries by Monsieur</HI> Martiniere, who went in one of the three ships belonging to the Northern Company of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> in the year 1653. and by that means had occasion to converse with the <HI>Norwegians, Islanders, Lap∣landers, Kilops, Borandians, Siberians, Zemblians,</HI> and <HI>Samojedes,</HI> who are Neighbours to the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Tin∣gorses,</HI> in his 46 Chapter he expresseth himself after this manner. There having fallen into my hands several Geo∣graphical Charts of sundry eminent and much celebrated Authors, I am much amazed to see how they are mistaken in the position of <HI>Zembla,</HI> which they place much nearer the North Pole than really it is; they divide it likewise by the Sea from <HI>Greenland,</HI> and place it far distant from it, when as indeed those two Countries are Contiguous, the Coasts of <HI>Greenland</HI> butting upon the Coasts of <HI>Zem∣bla,</HI> so as did not the great quantity of Snow, and the violence of the cold render those Borders uninhabitable, the passage would be very easie by Land from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>Zembla,</HI> and from <HI>Zembla</HI> passing the <HI>Pater-noster</HI> Mountains to enter into <HI>Samojedia,</HI> from thence into <HI>Tar∣tary</HI> or <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as one pleased: But of the truth of this we shall be further informed at the return of Captain <HI>Wood.</HI></P>
<P>I was amazed likewise to see they had described the Streight called <HI>Voygat,</HI> not above ten French Leagues in length, whereas it contains above five and thirty Dutch Leagues, which is six times as much. Again, they would perswade us that through that Streight our ships might pass into the great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Ocean, which is a mistake. And although they indeed do affirm that in the time of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> a Dutch Vessel passed that way into that Ocean, yet it is a manifest errour, that Streight being bounded, as I said before, by the <HI>Pater-noster</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="11"/> Mountains, which are half a League high, and the tops of them covered with perpetual Snow, which never dis∣solves. And of this I can give a positive testimony, ha∣ving been my self in that Streight under those Mountains in the Dog-days, which is the hottest time of the year.</P>
<P>From the Steeple of the Old Church of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I had a good prospect of the Town, and the great number of ships lying upon one side of it, like a Wood; and all the Towns about it. The Roofs of the Houses being sharp, it is a most uneven Town to be looked upon downward, as it is a handsome one to be looked on up∣ward; and is not so divertising or pleasing to the sight, as some Towns in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> which have flatter Roofs, or else are covered with a fine black Slat or Ar∣doise. Upon this, and all other Towers of the Town, a Trumpet is sounded at Midnight, and in other parts of the City at six a Clock night and morning. At eleven a clock, the time of going on to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> there is good Musick at the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> given by the Earl of <HI>Lei∣cester.</HI> They make good Harmony also every hour in playing upon their Chimes and Bells in most Steeples. And there is a Musick-house or Entertaining-house, where any one is admitted for a Stiver, hears most sorts of Mu∣sick, seeth many good Water-works, and divers motions by Clock-work, Pictures, and other Divertisements.</P>
<P>During my stay at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I had the opportunity of seeing divers Learned Men, and Persons of Note. Dr. <HI>Ruish</HI> shewed us many Curiosities in Anatomy, as the <HI>Skeletons</HI> of young Children, and <HI>Faetus's</HI> of all A∣ges, neatly set together, and very white; the <HI>Lympha∣tick vessels</HI> so preserved, as to see the <HI>valves</HI> in them. A Liver excarnated, showing the Minute vessels, all shining and clear. The Muscles of Children dissected and kept
<PB N="17" REF="11"/> from corruption: entire Bodies preserved; the face of one was very remarkable, without the least spot or change of colour or alteration of the lineaments, from what might be expected immediately after death: he had then kept it two years, and hoped it would so continue. Dr. <HI>Swammerdam</HI> shewed us divers of his Experiments which he hath set down in his Treatise <HI>De Respiratione;</HI> and a very fair Collection of Insects brought from several Countries; a <HI>Stagg-fly</HI> of a very great bigness; an <HI>Indi∣an Scolopendria,</HI> or <HI>Forty-foot;</HI> a fly called <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> and many other Curiosities. Old <HI>Glawber</HI> the Chymist shew∣ed us his Laboratory: And we received much civility from <HI>Blasius</HI> the Physick Professour who hath wrote a Comment upon <HI>Veslingius.</HI></P>
<P>The Jews live more handsomly and splendidly here, than in any other place: Their chief Synagogue is large, adorned with Lamps of Brass and Silver. We happen∣ed to be there at the Feast of their <HI>New-year;</HI> so that their blowing of Horns, showting and singing was not omitted: Some of them understand divers Languages. I saw one <HI>Moses di Pas,</HI> a Learned young Man, and <HI>Orobio</HI> a Physician of Note. And I was sorry to see divers here to profess themselves publickly Jews, who had lived at least reputed Christians, for a long time in other places: One who had been a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Frier thirty years: and another who had been Professour some years at <HI>Tholouze,</HI> and before that Physician to the King of <HI>Spain. Juda Leo</HI> a Jew, hath taken great pains in making a Model of the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s House, the Fort of the Temple, the Tabernacle, the Israelites encamping, and other Curiosities. I was present at the Circumcisi∣on of a Child; which is performed by thrusting a Probe in between the <HI>Glans</HI> and <HI>Praeputium,</HI> and separating it, or dilating the <HI>Praeputium,</HI> so as the inward Skin may be
<PB N="18" REF="12"/> drawn forward as well as the outward; then by apply∣ing an Instrument joynted like a Carpenters Rule, or a Sector, the Skin is held fast beyond the <HI>Glans,</HI> and with a broad Incision-knife, or Circumcision-knife, the Foreskin is cut off close to the Instrument; and what remains of Skin is immediately put back, the blood stop∣ped with Powders, and a Plaister applyed; the Relations and Acquaintance singing all the while, whereby the cries of the Infant are less heard.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I passed by a peculiar Burial∣place of the Jews, who are not permitted to interr their dead within the Walls, by <HI>Overskerk, Bamburg,</HI> and in six or seven hours arrived at <HI>Utretcht,</HI> in a Boat drawn with Horses through artificial Cuts of Water, which is the way of Travelling in <HI>Holland, Utretcht,</HI> and divers other Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Utretcht</HI> is an ancient, large, handsome City, and chief of the Province of the same name, called formerly <HI>Anto∣nina,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Ultrajectum.</HI> Long famous for its Episcopal See founded by <HI>Dagobert</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who endowed it richly with Lands and Possessions: <HI>Willebald,</HI> or <HI>Willebrode</HI> an Englishman, was their first Bishop, who converted these Countries unto Christianity; and the following Bishops grew so powerful, that they were able to bring many thousand men into the field, and to wage great Wars against the Counts of <HI>Holland:</HI> Their Suc∣cession also continued for above Nine hundred years. It is now an University, founded by the States in the Year 1636. I shall not trouble you with the Names of the Pro∣fessors; the Learned Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> whom I had the honour to meet in divers places abroad, having already caused to be printed the <HI>Series Lectionum</HI> of this and many other Universities in the <HI>Low-Countries, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in his <HI>Observations Topographical, Moral. Physiological,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="12"/> set forth 1673. The great Church hath a very high Tower, or three Steeples one above another: From the highest of which I had not only a good sight of the Town it self, which lay under mine Eye like a Platform, but of many others also; <HI>Utretcht</HI> being in a plain flat Country, and so well seated, and encompassed with so populous a Country, that in a days Journey a man may go from hence to any one of fifty walled Towns and Cities. The <HI>English</HI> Church here is an ancient Building; the Pillar in the middle of it, whose Foundation could not be laid but upon Bulls-hides, is much taken notice of: It was built 1099. and hath the Picture of a Bull upon it with this In∣scription;</P>
<Q><L><HI>Accipe Posteritas quod per tua saecula narres,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Taurinis cutibus fundo solidata columna est.</HI></L></Q>
<P>There is an old Library belonging to this Church, which containeth divers old Books and Manuscripts. A large Bible in six Volumes, painted and gilded after a very ancient manner: Two Idols taken (in time of war) long since in <HI>Germany,</HI> and given to this place by the Emper∣our <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, are worth the seeing, not so much for their neatness, as their Antiquity and odd shape: As also a Horn made out of a Tooth, said to be given at the same time. There are also three <HI>Unicorns</HI> Horns, little differing in length; the longest being five foot and an half: I drank out of one of them, the end being tipp'd with Silver, and made hollow to serve for a Cup. These were of the <HI>Sea-Unicorn,</HI> or the Horn or long wreathed Tooth of some Sea-Animal much like it, taken in the Northern Seas; of which I have seen many, both in Publick Repo∣sitories, and in Private Hands. Two such as these, the one Ten foot long, were presented not many years since
<PB N="20" REF="13"/> to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> being taken near to <HI>Nova Zem∣bla;</HI> and I have seen some full fifteen foot long; some wreathed very thick, some not so much, and others al∣most plain: Some largest and thickest at the End near the head; others are largest at some distance from the Head: Some very sharp at the end or point, and others blunt. My honoured Father Sir <HI>T. B.</HI> hath a very fair piece of one which was formerly among the Duke of <HI>Curlands</HI> Rarities, but after that he was taken Prisoner by <HI>Doug∣las</HI> in the wars between <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> it came into a Merchants hands, of whom my Father had it, he hath also a piece of this sort of <HI>Unicorns</HI> Horn burnt black, out of the Emperour of <HI>Russia</HI>'s <HI>Repositorie,</HI> given him by Dr. <HI>Arthur Dee,</HI> who was Son to Dr. <HI>John Dee,</HI> and also Physician to the Emperour of <HI>Russia,</HI> when his Chambers were burned, in which he preserved his Curiosities. I have seen a walking Staff, a Scepter, a Scabbard for a Sword, Boxes, and other Curiosities made out of this Horn, but was never so fortunate as from experience to confirm its Medical Efficacy against Poysons, contagious Diseases, or any other evident effect of it, although I have known it given several times, and in great quanti∣ty. But of these <HI>Unicorns</HI> Horns no man sure hath so great a Collection as the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and his Fa∣ther had so many, that he was able to spare about an hun∣dred of them, to build a Magnificent Throne out of <HI>U∣nicorns</HI> Horns.</P>
<P>I had the honour to see divers Persons of Note in this City; as <HI>D. Cyprianus ab Oostergo,</HI> Dr. <HI>Regius, Voetius,</HI> the only Member then left alive of the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> and others; but missed the sight of the Learned <HI>Anna Maria Skurman,</HI> who was then gone out of Town, and was for∣ced to content my self with beholding her Picture, well drawn by her own hand, with this Inscription of hers un∣der it:</P>
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
<Q><L><HI>Ceruitis hic pict â nostros in Imagine vultus,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Si negat ars formam gratia vestra dabit.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Painters Hall is considerable, wherein are many good pieces to be seen of several Masters: Amongst which there are good Heads by <HI>Van Colen</HI> and <HI>Tuart;</HI> Land∣skips by <HI>Soft-lever;</HI> and good Drapery, especially in some Turkish Habits, by <HI>Van der Mere.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is also beautified with a fair Piazza or Market-place, divers long Streets, and a <HI>Pall-mall</HI> with five rows of Trees on each side. In the Church of St. <HI>Katherino</HI> is the Tomb of my Lord <HI>Gorge.</HI> Though I had seen <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Noble Cities thereof, which are worthily admired by all, yet I was much sur∣prized upon the first sight of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> espe∣cially of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the adjoyning places. He that hath observed the easie accommodation for Travel there∣in, both by Land and Water, their excellent order and regular course in all things; the number of Learned men; the abundance of Varieties in all kinds; the industry, frugality, and wealth of the people; their numerous good Towns; their extraordinary neatness in their Build∣ings and Houses; their proper Laws and administration of Justice; and their incredible Number of Shipping and Boats, will think it an omission to rest in the sight of other Countries without a view of this. A Country of little extent, and soon travelled over, but so replenished with People, with good Cities, fair Towns and Villages, as not to be met with upon so little a compass of ground, except perhaps in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Utrecht,</HI> in two hours, I came to <HI>Friswick,</HI> and passed over the River <HI>Leck</HI> to <HI>Viaenen,</HI> where there is lit∣tle remarkable besides the House and Gardens of Count
<PB N="22" REF="14"/> <HI>Brederode,</HI> one of the Ancient Nobility of <HI>Holland,</HI> or, according to common esteem, of the most Noble Family of all; the Family of the <HI>Egmonds</HI> being formerly esteem∣ed the Richest; the <HI>Wassenaer</HI>'s the most ancient, and the <HI>Brederodes</HI> the Noblest. The Mount in this Garden ser∣veth for the Rampart to the Town, and on a round <HI>Bull∣wark</HI> are divers small brass Guns planted. The Statua's of the twelve <HI>Caesars,</HI> of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> the Pyramids and Par∣titions, with the Paintings upon the wall, are the rest of its Ornaments.</P>
<P>From hence I passed still by Boat through the Land of <HI>Arkel,</HI> some say, derived from <HI>Hercules;</HI> belonging for∣merly to the Lords of <HI>Gorchom</HI> and <HI>Arkeland,</HI> till by <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> daughter to the last Lord of <HI>Arkeland,</HI> it sell to <HI>John</HI> Lord of <HI>Egmond,</HI> and afterwards was sold to <HI>William</HI> the sixth Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> I arrived this night at <HI>Gorchom,</HI> a Town well seated, near three Rivers, the <HI>Ling,</HI> the <HI>Wael,</HI> and the <HI>Maes.</HI> The Market-place is fair; the <HI>Stadt∣huis</HI> is sunk somewhat on one side. The Governour hath a good House, and the Church a very high thick Steeple: the Works are of Earth; the Water-gate is handsome, and over it in Great Letters is this Inscription;</P>
<Q>Civitas in quâ maximè Cives legibus parent, &amp; in pace beata, &amp; bello invicta. 1642.</Q>
<P>The more remarkable because it made good its Inscrip∣tion in the year 1672. when <HI>Louis</HI> the Fourteenth, King of <HI>France,</HI> came down with so powerful an Army into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> that in that Summers Expedition he took thirty walled Towns and Cities, this Water-gate being the Limit to his Conquests this way, beyond which his Forces were not able to attempt any thing.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
<P>Leaving <HI>Gorcum,</HI> I passed by <HI>Worcum,</HI> on the other side of the River, and then by the Castle of <HI>Lovesteyn,</HI> strongly seated and well fortified; and therefore hath been often made use of to secure Persons of Note. Sir <HI>George Ascue</HI> of late years suffered his Imprisonment here∣in, and formerly <HI>Barnevelt;</HI> upon which occasion this Castle hath been much spoken of, and hath given the name to that whole party who sided with him, well known at pre∣sent by the name of the <HI>Lovestein</HI> Faction. Passing on fur∣ther up the <HI>Maes,</HI> I left <HI>Proye</HI> on the left hand, and <HI>Huesden</HI> on the right, and the next day morning arrived at the <HI>Bosch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hertogen Bosch, Sylva Ducis, Boscum Ducis, Boisle∣duc, Bolduc,</HI> takes its name from a Wood belonging to the Dukes of <HI>Brabant:</HI> It is a strong pleasant City, seated upon the River <HI>Disa</HI> or <HI>Deese,</HI> which entreth the <HI>Maes,</HI> about two Leagues below it; one of the greatest Cities in <HI>Brabant;</HI> and for its strength, for which 'tis be∣holden both to Nature and to Art, the States of the <HI>Uni∣ted Provinces</HI> possess not any one more considerable, and is a very good Frontier against all Enemies on this side: It is encompassed on all sides with Fenns and Marshy Grounds. The <HI>Avenues</HI> to it are by narrow Causies, made turning and winding, to be commanded in all pla∣ces by one or other of the six Sconces or Forts built at some distance without the Town for its greater Security. Besides which, the Hollanders having some reason to be jealous of the Inhabitants, whose affections might incline them towards the neighbouring Princes, of whose Reli∣gion most of them are, they have built a Citadel within the Town, a Briel or pair of Spectacles to look more ac∣curately into their Affairs. It is a handsom regular Fort of five Bastions, each Curtain is 84 ordinary paces long; the Faces of each Bastion 63; and the Flank or Neck 24. There is a handsome House of Stone for the Centry
<PB N="24" REF="15"/> at the point of each Bastion, and the middle of each Cur∣tain, every one of which cost Seven hundred Guldens. Here is also a Field Canon of an extraordinary length, said to be able to fling a Bullet almost as far as <HI>Bommel.</HI> The Piazza in this Town is Triangular.</P>
<P>This City was made an Episcopal See, 1559. The Ca∣thedral is Dedicated to St. <HI>John.</HI> In the Quire are paint∣ed the Arms of many of the Knights of the <HI>Golden Fleece.</HI> And over the upper Stalls or Seats, an Inscription in <HI>French,</HI> which contains the History of the first Instituti∣on, and Model of this Order, by the most High and mighty Prince <HI>Philip</HI> the Good, Duke of <HI>Burgundy, Lo∣rain,</HI> and <HI>Brabant:</HI> Besides divers Statua's and Pillars. There are also several Monuments of the Bishops of <HI>Bosche</HI> and others.</P>
<P>This Town was taken from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> by the Forces of the Confederate Estates, in the year 1628. af∣ter a long and chargeable Siege; in which the little Sconce, one of the Forts towards the South, did excel∣lent Service.</P>
<P>Divers of the Nuns were still alive in this Town, but at <HI>Utretcht</HI> they were all dead.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Bosche</HI> we travelled through a plain Country, somewhat Sandy, to <HI>Breda</HI> upon the River <HI>Merck:</HI> A place very considerable, pleasantly seated, and well∣fortified. It hath formerly had more Outworks than at present: For they have taken away the Crown-works, and left only the Half-moons and Horn-works, and Con∣serves or Contregards about the Half-moons. There is a large Ditch of Water round the Counterscarp, and a small Ravelin between each Bastion, joyned to the Ram∣part within side of the Ditch. There is also a double Haye or Quickset-hedge almost quite round the Town, be∣sides Palisados. The <HI>Parapet</HI> is very thick, and strengthned
<PB N="25" REF="15"/> with a row of Elms, and seconded with another row at three or four yards distance, round the Town; the bo∣dies of the <HI>Bastions</HI> are sunk down or h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowed away, and filled with a thicket of Elms. The Half Moons are the like without the Town, and after all, a brest-work between the Town and the <HI>Bastions;</HI> and Cavaliers upon several places of the Rampart.</P>
<P>This Town belongeth unto the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> un∣to whom it hath descended by the right of the house of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>Engelbert</HI> the seventh Earle of that house, with <HI>Mary</HI> daughter and Heir of <HI>Philip</HI> the last Lord thereof, about the year 1400. It was taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the beginning of the Low Country Wars, and was afterwards Surprised by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by a stratagem performed by eighty men hid in a Boat covered over with Turf, and so let into the Castle. In the year 1625. the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took it again, as by In∣scriptions and <HI>Chronograms</HI> are to be seen in divers places, as that over the door of the Church.</P>

<P>The Church is fair and hath many good Monuments, as <HI>Renesse's</HI> Tombe; a Monument for Sir <HI>Thomas Alesbury</HI> set up by the Lord Chancellor <HI>Hide;</HI> an old Tombe e∣rected 1349. for <HI>John</HI> Lord of <HI>Lech</HI> and <HI>Breda;</HI> the Tombe of Grave <HI>Engleberg Van Nassaw</HI> and his family on the side of the Wall; the <HI>Here Van Horne</HI> and his three Wives; but the Principal Monument is that of Grave <HI>Hendrick Van Nassaw,</HI> whose Armour is support∣ed by four Warriers upon their Knees; he built the Ca∣stle of <HI>Breda,</HI> which is at present both strong and beau∣tiful: I observed the place where the Turfe-Boat came in, and where the Prince came over into the Town. The Gallery, the Garden, the Walks, and Dials are worth the seeing, the Town in handsomely built, populous, and generally hath a great Garrison in it.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Breda</HI> we soon came by Land to St. <HI>Gertruyden∣berg</HI> the last Town on the North of <HI>Brabant,</HI> where it joyneth to the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> a small place, but a good Town for fishing, lying upon a Hill near the great broad Water called <HI>de Waert,</HI> made by the falling of the <HI>Maes</HI> and many other Rivers into it. This Town is fortified and Garrisoned. The Church and Steeple have been Large and fair, and the ruines of the latter are observable, in regard that this Steeple was shot down by a Stratagem of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> while the Governour and chief of the Town were upon it, to observe a false a∣larm in the Prince's Camp, and so lost themselves and the Town. We Passed from hence over a large Water which hath overflow'd a great part of the Country upon one side of it, no less than seventy two Parishes being
<PB N="27" REF="16"/> drowned at once, the Village of <HI>Ramsdun</HI> onely escaping, and so by an old Tower called the house of <HI>Murney,</HI> to the <HI>Maiden</HI> Town of <HI>Dort,</HI> or <HI>Dordrecht.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dordracum,</HI> so called by some from <HI>Duri</HI> or <HI>Dureti forum,</HI> at present <HI>Dort,</HI> being seated in the Waves of those great Lakes made by the <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Waal,</HI> is not unaptly from its situation compared to a Swans nest, it is reckoned the first and chief Town of South <HI>Holland,</HI> in respect of its antiquity, as having served to secure <HI>Odo∣cer</HI> in his retreat almost eight hundred years since, and also in respect of its Priviledges, in having the Mint here, and being the Staple for Rhenish wine and English Cloath.</P>
<P>In this Town are many fair houses and pleasant Gar∣dens. The great Church is large, the Steeple 312 steps high; the top thereof being made of four large Dy∣alls. There is also an Exchange or Place for Merchants to meet. The <HI>English</HI> have two Churches, and the <HI>French</HI> one. The Key or Head to the water side is handsome, and the Country about very pleasant; we saw the Chamber wherein the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Dort</HI> was assembled 1611. a large fair room; and took a collation in the same house, in a high turret overlooking the Town and Coun∣try: Our seats Moving round about the Table continu∣ally; so as the diversity of the prospect made it more delightful. The great Vessels round-bellied, which trade between <HI>Coln</HI> and this City seemed strange; as also the long <HI>Luyck</HI> or <HI>Liege</HI>-boats; and the number of Peo∣ple that continually live in them. At my going away from hence I embarked in a Vessel bound for the Island of <HI>Walcheren,</HI> sayling by most of the Islands of <HI>Zealand</HI> and in sight of divers good Towns. as <HI>Willemstadt, Zirick∣ze, Tergoes;</HI> observing in some places where the Sea had overflow'd the Land; and in others where the Industry of
<PB N="28" REF="17"/> the Inhabitants still keep it out, by keeping up their banks, and thatching the Shoars of the Sea. We Land∣ed at <HI>Ter-Vere,</HI> where there is a good Haven and Harbour for Ships, the Walls were built in the year 1357, to∣wards the Sea are round towers. The <HI>Piazza</HI> is long. The <HI>Scotch</HI> have had a Factory here for above two hun∣dred years, and the <HI>Marquiss</HI> of this Place did formerly make one of the three States, by which <HI>Zealand</HI> was Go∣verned. The Abbot of St <HI>Nicholas</HI> in <HI>Middleburg</HI> re∣presenting the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and the Towns of <HI>Middleburg, Zirickzee, Ter-Veer, Flussing, Tolen, Martins-dike, Romerswal</HI> and <HI>Tergoes,</HI> supplying the Third: over against this place where a Town had former∣ly sunk into the Sea, the Steeple only remaineth to be seen. From hence to <HI>Middleburg</HI> the way is Paved with Brick; as it is also from Town to Town in most places of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Middleburg</HI> is the chief Town in the Island <HI>Walachria,</HI> seated almost in the middle of it, being well built, large, rich, and Populous, it is the fourth Port for the <HI>East-India</HI> trade: hath a large, broad Water within the Town, and a streight cut through the Land to carry Vessels out to Sea, the whole is very well Fortified, the Officers here are chosen by Strangers or Foreigners, the Churches are many and remarkable, the new Church is of an eight∣square figure with a <HI>Cupola,</HI> the Tower of the old great Church very high, the <HI>Stadthuise</HI> with the old statuas, a∣bout it, the round <HI>Piazza,</HI> and many private buildings are Considerable, and the whole Country about it is fruitful; either divided into Gardens and Orchards, or Planted with <HI>Madder, Pompions,</HI> or Grain and Fruits. The <HI>Zealanders</HI> are generally addicted to the interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and great Lovers of his Person. I found them not a little delighted that the Prince had been
<PB N="29" REF="17"/> with them some days before, and was made <HI>Premier</HI> Noble, or chief of the States of <HI>Zealand;</HI> which was chiefly brought about, as I was informed, by <HI>Pensioner Hubert, Le Sage, Duvelaer</HI> and <HI>Vriebergen,</HI> formerly no great friends to the Prince, especially <HI>Vriebergen,</HI> who was the most earnest of any to bring him in, in despite to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for General <HI>Worts</HI> his sake, who be∣ing set over the <HI>Zealand</HI> forces by those of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> lately affronted <HI>Vriebergens</HI> Son who was a Colonel, at the head of his Regiment. I was entertained at <HI>Middle∣burg</HI> very courteously by Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> the Minister, who also sent his Kinsman with me to <HI>Flussing. Flissinga</HI> or <HI>Vlus∣sing,</HI> hath Stone-Wals towards the Sea, and Mudworks towards the Land; a very good Port, and a strong Town; the waves of the Sea washing its walls; it was one of the first Towns which the Low Country men took from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the year 1572, and was made Cautionary to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> together with <HI>Rammakins</HI> and the <HI>Briel.</HI> 1585. The renowned Sr. <HI>Philip Sidney</HI> be∣ing the first Governour of it, and surrendred by King <HI>James</HI> to the United states. 1616. The Sea shoar here a∣bouts is not only faced with rushes, flaggs and reeds staked down as high as the Tide usually ariseth, but it is also strongly bound over with Osiers and hurdles and great Posts driven in to break the force of the Water, and secure the Piles which make the Harbour or Havens mouth. The Town-house is handsomely built, standing in the <HI>Piazza,</HI> having three rowes of Pillars in the Front one above another; the Lower <HI>Dorick,</HI> the second <HI>Io∣nick,</HI> and the highest <HI>Corinthian;</HI> and on the top there is a Gallery or Balcony to Discover ships at Sea. This is the third Port for the East-<HI>India</HI> trade; <HI>Amsterdam</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam</HI> being the first and second: here lay many great ships in the middle of the Town, and considerable
<PB N="30" REF="18"/> men of War, as the St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> and the Admiral of <HI>Zealand:</HI> we saw them also building of divers ships, and when the Prince was here, they Lanched one to diver∣tise him, to which he gave the name of William <HI>Frederick,</HI> they also presented him with a Golden Bottle; that be∣ing the Arms of the Town: the Prince Landed at <HI>Ar∣muyden</HI> and went from thence to <HI>Tergoes,</HI> and thence to <HI>Breda;</HI> they reported his entertainment in <HI>Walcheren</HI> a∣mounted to fifty thousand <HI>Guldens.</HI> The Women in this Island wear most of them red Cloth and straw-Hats, if a Man dies a great bundle of Straw is layd at the Door, if a Boy, a little one, if a Woman, the straw lies on the left side of the Door: when any Woman is brought to bed; they fasten a piece of Lawne to the ring and rapper of the Door; and make it up into a little baby or puppet finely pleated, and in such manner, as to distinguish of what sex the young Child is.</P>
<P>Returning to <HI>Middleburg</HI> by Land I observed there was a row of Trees round the Town between the moat and rampart, where ordinarily there is only a breast∣worke or a hedge, and embarked at <HI>Middleburg</HI> again, and passed down the River by the fort <HI>Rammakins,</HI> and so for the <HI>Schelde,</HI> Sayling up that noble River till we had passed the Fort <HI>Frederick Henrick</HI> and came to <HI>Lillo;</HI> where we stayd till the Vessell was searched. Over a∣gainst <HI>Lillo,</HI> lyeth another Fortification, called <HI>Lifgens hock;</HI> the Fort <HI>de la croix</HI> is the last that belongeth to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and lieth on the North side of the River; the Banks are cut nigh to it, and the Country drowned for its greater security. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Forts hereabouts to defend the Frontiers, are the <HI>Philip,</HI> the <HI>Pearl,</HI> and the <HI>Maria.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>Scaldis</HI> or <HI>Scheld</HI> mentioned by <HI>Caesar</HI> is a gallant River, affording plenty of fish, and convenience
<PB N="31" REF="18"/> for Navigation and passage unto several noted places: It ariseth in the Country of <HI>Vermandois,</HI> passing to <HI>Cambray, Valencienne,</HI> so to <HI>Tournay</HI> or <HI>Dornick, Oudenard, Gaunt, Rupelmond</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and pursuing its course is afterwards divided into two streams, whereof the Southern is called the <HI>Hont;</HI> the other runs by <HI>Bergen ap Zome,</HI> and so into the Sea between the Isles of <HI>Zea∣land.</HI></P>
<P>The next day morning we went on our Voyage still up the <HI>Scaldis</HI> or <HI>Schelde,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> Where I had the good fortune to see Mr. <HI>Hartop;</HI> one very well known in all those parts and of high esteem for his perso∣nal strength and valour. A Gentleman also so courteous that he makes it his business to oblige strangers; he shew'd me many curiosities in this City, carrying me with him in his Coach.</P>
<P>The Walls of <HI>Antwerp</HI> are very large, faced with Brick and freestone, having divrs rows of Trees upon them, broad walks, and conveniences for the Coaches, to make their tour upon. The <HI>Bastions</HI> are not so large as generally they build now a dayes, yet after the modern way. The Ditch is very broad and deep, the Country about it, all Gardens. The <HI>Cittadel</HI> is a regu∣lar fortification of five <HI>Bastions,</HI> wherein lies alwayes a Garrison of <HI>Spanish</HI> Soldiers: upon every curtain there are two mounts or Cavaliers; and between them below, a row of building or lodgings for the Soldiers; the ears of the <HI>Bastions</HI> are cut down, and <HI>Casamates</HI> made, and Palisados set round upon the <HI>Esplanade;</HI> the Walls are lined with excellent Brick and stone, nor is there any where a more regular beautifull Fortification of five <HI>Ba∣stions</HI> that is finished: it commands the City, the Ri∣ver and the Country: besides this <HI>Cittadel</HI> there is ano∣ther Fort within the Town near the <HI>Scheld,</HI> to command
<PB N="32" REF="19"/> the River, having eight Guns in it, called St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Fort.</P>
<P>The Exchange is handsome, supported by 36 Pillars e∣very one of a different carving, four streets lead unto it, so that standing in the middle we see through every one of them. The <HI>Meer</HI> or Largest street is considerable for the water running under it, and for the meeting of Coaches upon it every evening to make their tour through the streets of the City, which are clean and beautiful; at one end of it stands a large Brass Crucifix upon a Pedestall of Marble. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> Church goeth far beyond any of that bigness that I have seen out of <HI>Italy.</HI> The Front is noble, with the Statua of <HI>Ignatius Loyola</HI> on the top, A great part of the inside of the Roof was painted by <HI>Rubens,</HI> and some of it by <HI>Van Dyke:</HI> there be many Excellent peeces of flowers done by <HI>Segers</HI> a <HI>Iesuite;</HI> the Carving and gilding of all the works is exquisite: The Library of the Colledge is great, &amp; the Books disposed handsome∣ly into four Chambers; the Founder hereof was <HI>God∣fridus Houtappel,</HI> whose Monument, together with his Wife and Children are worth the seeing, in a Chappel on the South side of this Church. In the Church of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> is a large Silver Statua of our Lady, and models of Cityes in stone. <HI>Onsar Lieven Vrowen Kerck,</HI> or <HI>the Church of our blessed Lady</HI> is the greatest in the City; and the Steeple one of the fairest in the World, five hundred foot high: one of their feet is eleven of our inches; so as it is 459 of our feet. In this Church there is much Carving, and a great number of Pictures highly esteemed, among which one piece is much taken notice of, drawn by <HI>Quintin,</HI> at first a Smith, who made the neat Iron work of the Well before the West door; and afterwards to obtain his Mistress, he proved a famous Painter; his head is set up in Stone at the entrance of
<PB N="33" REF="19"/> the Church, with an inscription and this verse.</P>
<Q>Connubialis amor de Mulcibre fecit Apellem.</Q>
<P>I was at the famous Abby of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> pleasantly seated upon the <HI>Scheld;</HI> where among other curiosities, I saw a glass, which represented the Pictures of our <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> collected from the Putting together of divers other heads: One was represented from a Picture wherein were thirteen faces, and another from one of twelve; over the blessed Virgin was this In∣scription.</P>
<Q>Diva nitet variis expressa Maria Figuris.</Q>
<P>The Countess of <HI>Brabants</HI> Tombe, who was drowned, and her <HI>Statua,</HI> as also the Monument of <HI>Ortelius,</HI> are here shewn. <HI>Macarius Simoneus</HI> was then Abbot, the Monks 63. Near unto the Wharf-gate is the Church of St. <HI>Wal∣burgis</HI> an English Saint, who contributed much towards the conversion of these Countries.</P>
<P>The Town-house is fair, the House built for the East∣country Merchants is very stately and large, but runneth now to ruine, in this I saw among other curiosities, divers strange Musical instruments, which at present are not understood, or at least not made use of: The <HI>Hessen</HI> house hath been also formerly considerable. The water which they make use of in Brewing, is brought by an Aqueduct from <HI>Herentall</HI> about thirty miles distant from hence; and is conveyed into the Town by a large Chan∣nel, peculiarly walled in by it self where it passeth the Ditch; in this City are many good Collections of Pict∣ures both Ancient and Modern, and excellent Mini∣ature or Limning by <HI>Gonsol,</HI> one fine piece, which I
<PB N="34" REF="20"/> saw was peculiarly remarkable, it being the work of 35 several Masters.</P>
<P>From <HI>Antwerp,</HI> I passed to <HI>Brussels</HI> by water, chang∣ing Boats five times, and going through divers locks, by reason that the Country is so much higher about <HI>Brussels,</HI> and the water above two hundred foot lower at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> At <HI>Fontaine</HI> a league and half from <HI>Brussels,</HI> three Rivers cross one another: one of them being carried over a bridg. The <HI>Piazza</HI> of <HI>Brussels</HI> is fair. and oblong in fi∣gure upon one of the longest sides stands the Town∣house, and over against it the Kings-house, where upon a Scaffold hanged with Velvet, Count, <HI>Fgmond</HI> and <HI>Horne</HI> were beheaded, the whole <HI>Piazza</HI> being hanged with Black Cloth. Upon the top of the Town-house, stand: St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Patron of the City in Brass, Count <HI>Marsins</HI> house formerly belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> hath a fair Court, and overlooks a good part of the City, but a quarter of it is ruined by Lightning. The Thunder bolt or Stone which they affirm to have effected it, is bigger than two Mens heads, and hangs up upon the door at the entrance. The <HI>Iesuites</HI> Church is handsome, and in it the fair white Tower is beautifully gilded at the top. The <HI>Carmelites</HI> Church hath a noble Altar, and near unto the Church is the <HI>Statua</HI> of a pissing boy, which is a con∣tinual Conduit. The Armory was well furnished, as we were informed, before the Governours of the low Coun∣tries sold the Arms; and <HI>Cassel Roderigo</HI> the Governour left it very bare. There remains the Armour of <HI>Charls</HI> the fifth, of Duke <HI>Albert,</HI> of the Prince of <HI>Parma, Er∣nestus,</HI> and of the Duke <HI>d'Alva</HI> and of the Duke <HI>Alberts</HI> horse who being shot saved his Master, and died the same day twelve month; Spears for the hunting the wild Boar, one with two Pistols; The Armour of Cardinal <HI>Infan∣te,</HI> and of an <HI>Indian</HI> King; A <HI>Polish</HI> musket which carri∣eth
<PB N="35" REF="20"/> six hundred paces; <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth's Sword for the making the Knights of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth's Sword sent to declare war; Good Bucklers for Defence, and some well wrought; especially one with the Battel of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> and his Elephants; and Banners ta∣ken with <HI>Francis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> at the Battel of <HI>Pa∣via.</HI></P>
<P>Somewhat like <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillons</HI> shooting the three Pigeons near the Tower of <HI>David,</HI> is the shot which <HI>Infanta Isabella</HI> made, when with an Arrow she killed a Bird, in memory whereof, a Bird pierced with an Ar∣row is set upon the top of a Tower in the Count, which is large; and if the New Buildings and Design were con∣tinued, it would be very handsome. Before the Court stand five brass Statues. The Park is pleasant, with Trees set in order, and adorned with Grotto's, Foun∣tains, and Water-works, which come very near the <HI>Ita∣lian;</HI> one piece somewhat imitating <HI>Frascati,</HI> in which all Musical Instruments are imitated, and a perpetual mo∣tion attempted: and on the Front of the Buildings stand the <HI>Caesars</HI> head. But the Eccho is most remarkable; which may perfectly be distinguished to ten or twelve Replies. The greatest Church is that of St. <HI>Gudula;</HI> in which is her Statua, the Devil striving to blow out the Light of her Lanthorn. Two Chappels therein are re∣markable; the one built by <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> very fair on the outside: the other towards the North, hath been visited by five Kings, in which is the Host which bled being stabbed by the Jews. In the <HI>Dominican</HI> Church is the Monument of the Duke of <HI>Cleve</HI> and his Dutchess, in <HI>Go∣rinthian</HI> brass. But for a New Church that of the <HI>Be∣gennes,</HI> or Pious Maids, is very considerable; there be∣ing Eight hundred of them in this City, who have a par∣ticular place allotted to them, where they have built this
<PB N="36" REF="21"/> milk white Church. The Plague was much in this place at that time, three hundred Houses being shut up, and a Garland placed on the doors, in the middle of which † was written IHS. I saw the <HI>English</HI> Nunnery, and o∣ther considerable Buildings. And after I had refreshed my self at the Fish-Tavern, which is worth the seeing, especially for two Rooms in it, furnished from top to bottom with very good Pictures, I returned to <HI>Ant∣werp.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 4. I travelled through an open Country, and lodged at <HI>Molin bruslè.</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers met us upon the Road this day, some of them well mounted and armed, and begged of us, and were well satisfied with a small Benevolence. The next day we entred the Country of <HI>Liege,</HI> and passed great Heaths, and on the Sixth, in the morning, arrived at <HI>Maestreicht.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Trajectum ad Mosam,</HI> or <HI>Maestreicht,</HI> is a strong Town, seated upon the <HI>Maes,</HI> four Leagues below <HI>Liege.</HI> The Out-works are very considerable; the Wall is old. To∣wards the South-east lyeth a Hill, which ariseth gently, and overlooks part of the Town. Under this Hill is one of the noblest Quarries of Stone in the World. To se∣cure the Town from the disadvantage it might receive from this Hill, there was formerly a Fort built upon it, but it hath been long since slighted; and they have made out an Horn-work within Musket-shot of it, and the Ba∣stion answering to it is made very high, to cover the Town. On the other side of the River standeth <HI>Wicke,</HI> very well fortified also, and rather stronger than <HI>Mae∣streicht,</HI> into which they might retire if the Town should be taken by Storm, it being united to <HI>Maestreicht</HI> by a handsome Bridge over the <HI>Maes,</HI> consisting of Nine Ar∣ches. All about <HI>Wicke</HI> the Country is flat: there are
<PB N="37" REF="21"/> many Inhabitants in it, and a handsome Glass house.</P>
<P>The private Houses of <HI>Maestreicht</HI> are generally cove∣red with a black Slat, or Ardoise, otherwise not very beautiful. The Town house is fair, seated in one of the <HI>Piazza's,</HI> built of white Stone; it hath Nine large Windowes in a row on each side, and within is very well painted by <HI>Theodorus van der Schuer,</HI> who was Painter to the Queen of <HI>Sweden.</HI> In another <HI>Piaz∣za</HI> is a Fountain, rows of Trees, and the great Church. This Town was besieged and taken from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> by the Confederate States, in the year 1632.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> the Seventh I dined at <HI>Gallop,</HI> a small place, and came that night to <HI>Aken, Aix la Chapelle,</HI> or <HI>Aquis∣grane,</HI> an ancient noble City, the Inhabitants Courteous, and much frequented by reason of its hot Baths, of which I shall speak more particularly in my Journey from <HI>Colen</HI> to <HI>London.</HI> Leaving <HI>Aken</HI> I travelled to∣wards <HI>Juliers</HI> or <HI>Gulick,</HI> but it being late before we arrived, the Gates were shut up, so as we went on∣ly under the Walls, leaving it on our right hand. Near unto <HI>Gulick</HI> runneth a shallow swift River, called the <HI>Roer.</HI> At the Mouth of it, where it fal∣leth into the <HI>Maes,</HI> is seated a considerable Town, called <HI>Roermonde,</HI> through which I passed in the year 1673. when Sir <HI>Lionel Jenkins</HI> and Sir <HI>Joseph Wil∣liamson</HI> were sent Plenipotentiaries to <HI>Cologne,</HI> in our Journey from <HI>Antwerp</HI> to that City. We then pas∣sed the Country of <HI>Brabant,</HI> by the way of <HI>Thornhaut, Weert, Roermonde,</HI> and the next Night passing by <HI>Erke∣lens,</HI> lodged at <HI>Castro,</HI> or <HI>Caster,</HI> in <HI>Gulickland,</HI> where there are still the remains of an old Castle, formerly built for the Defence of that part of the Country. <HI>Roermonde</HI> is seated upon a rising Hill, near the River
<PB N="38" REF="22"/> <HI>Roer,</HI> hath a Colledge of Jesuits in it, a handsome <HI>Pi∣azza,</HI> and an old Abby with divers Monuments very ancient, founded by <HI>Gerard</HI> Earl of <HI>Guelderland.</HI> From this Town their Excellencies were saluted with the Guns from their Walls, charged with Bullets. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in most places striving to express the highest of their respects.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gulick</HI> I travelled to <HI>Cologne,</HI> where I arrived <HI>October</HI> the <HI>10th,</HI> 1668.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM COLEN TO VIENNA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Olen, Coln,</HI> or <HI>Colonia Agrippina,</HI> was anciently the Capital City of the <HI>Ubii,</HI> a people who were at first possessed of the Countries now called <HI>Berg</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> but being over run by the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> next to them, <HI>Agrippa,</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Gallia,</HI> received them into protecti∣on, and placed them upon this side of the <HI>Roman</HI> shoar of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> where they built this place, and called it <HI>Oppidum Ubiorum,</HI> and the <HI>Romans</HI> seating themselves here for the defence of the Country, in Honour of <HI>A∣grippina,</HI> daughter to <HI>Germanicus,</HI> and wife to <HI>Claudius,</HI> whose Birth-place it was, gave it afterwards the Name of <HI>Colonia Agrippina.</HI> It is at present one of the largest, if
<PB N="40" REF="23"/> not the greatest, of any City in <HI>Germany,</HI> secured to∣wards the Land by a high Wall, and two deep Trenches, and towards the Water by a Wall of Stone. The <HI>Rhine</HI> renders it delightful upon one side, and divers rows of Trees enclose the Town towards the Land. They have some Out-works, as Half-moons and Ravelins, but their best security is in the great number of men which they are able to raise within themselves. Many of the Streets are broad, and paved with broad stones.</P>
<P>It received the Christian Faith very early, and <HI>Ma∣ternus</HI> was their Bishop above 1350 years since, who subscribed, amongst others, to the Council of <HI>Arles.</HI> They have a great number of Churches, and well endowed, which take up a great part of the Town; The Prebends and Canons Houses having in many places Vineyards, and large Gardens adjoyning. Towards the North end of the Town, the Church of St. <HI>Kunibald</HI> is considerable. The Convent of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> is fair, and newly built, with a Garden in the Court, and all the Chambers uniform. The Jesuites Church is well built and stored with rich Copes, Altar-pieces, and other Ornaments. In the Church of St. <HI>Gereon,</HI> a Saint of great name here, marty∣red about <HI>Colen</HI> in the time of <HI>Maximianus,</HI> are about a thousand Saints heads, and on each side of the Altar a large Statua, whereof one is of a Moor; and under the Quire another Church. The Convent of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> is also considerable, wherein the Treaty of Peace was held with good accommodation in it, though with no success, in the year 1673. In the Church of St. <HI>Ursula</HI> is her Tomb, and the Tombs of divers of the Eleven thousand Virgins, martyred by the <HI>Huns.</HI> Upon the Monument of St. <HI>Ursula</HI> is this Inscription;
<Q>Sepulcrum Sanctae Ursulae indicio Columbae detectum.</Q>
<PB N="41" REF="23"/> Upon many of the Tombs which are old are Crosses and Lamps. Many Bones and Heads of the Martyrs are also kept in this Church. The Cathedral is dedicated to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and is very large, but not finished. The Body of the Church hath four rows of Pillars within it. The Quire is handsome and very high: behind it are believed to be the Tombs of the three Wise men which came from the East to worship our Saviour, or the Kings of <HI>Arabia,</HI> of whom it was prophesied that they should bring Gifts, commonly called the three Kings of <HI>Colen: Melchior,</HI> who offered Gold, <HI>Gaspar</HI> Frankincense, and <HI>Balthasar</HI> Myrrhe. Their Bodies, as the account goeth, were first removed to <HI>Constantinople</HI> by <HI>Helena</HI> the Mother of <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> the Great; then to <HI>Milan</HI> by <HI>Eustorfius</HI> Bishop thereof; and they have now rested at <HI>Colen</HI> for above five hundred years, being translated from <HI>Milan</HI> hither by <HI>Rainoldus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Colen,</HI> in the year 1164. There are also divers other Monuments of Bishops, and Noble Persons in Brass and Stone, and one in the shape of a Castle with six Towers. The Canons of this Church are all Noblemen; among whom the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> who ordinarily resides at <HI>Dusseldorff,</HI> about twenty <HI>English</HI> miles below this City, upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> hath two Sons. In a Church dedicated to all the Apostles, they shew a Tomb, which being opened by Thieves, intending to plunder it, the woman buried in it arose up and went home, and lived with her Husband divers years after. In one of the Streets is a Tower, or rather one Tower upon another, which seems to be ancient, now made a Prison. Upon another Ruine also in the Streets lies a Tombemade out of one Stone; of which sort of Tombs there are ma∣ny in this City and other places; but the greatest number of them I ever saw was at <HI>Arles</HI> in <HI>Provence.</HI></P>
<P>The Senate House is Noble, having a fair Tower upon
<PB N="42" REF="24"/> it, from whence there is a good prospect over the City. Upon the Front of the Senate House is a Man in <HI>Basso re∣lievo,</HI> fighting with a Lyon, who, as it was related to me, was formerly one of the Consuls, who having had a contest with some Clergy-men about the Government of the City, on a suddain they caused a Lyon to be let in up∣on him: upon which occasion he behaved himself so well, as he delivered himself, and slew the Lyon.</P>
<P>The Elector or Archbishop of <HI>Colen</HI> hath two Palaces in the City, but by agreement between him and the Town, he is not to stay here above three days together. Only this present Archbishop, upon the coming down of the Im∣perial Forces, and his loss of <HI>Bonna,</HI> took Sanctuary here in the Convent of St. <HI>Pantaleon,</HI> where he continued a great while.</P>
<P>The City is Imperial and Free, and yet it doth Ho∣mage to the Elector, much after this Form: <HI>We free Ci∣tizens of</HI> Colen <HI>promise to the Archbishop, to be faithful and favourable unto him as long as he preserves us in Right and Honour, and in our ancient Priviledges, Us, our Wives, our Children, and our City of</HI> Colen. Most of the City are of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and the whole Town so full of Convents, Churches, Church-men and Reliques, that it is not undeservedly styled the <HI>Rome of Germany.</HI> The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have also a Church within the Walls, and the <HI>Calvinists</HI> at <HI>Mulheim,</HI> half a League down the Stream on the other side of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>Over against <HI>Colen</HI> lieth <HI>Dútz,</HI> a small Village, inhabi∣ted chiefly by Jews. The Vessels which come out of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> hither are long, round bellied, and of great burden. Near to the Wall of the Town, upon the Quay or Key, is a kind of Harbour made for them, into which they may be drawn, and escape the Injuries they would otherwise suffer by the Ice in Winter.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="24"/>
<P>Besides the rich Clergy, there are many wealthy Citi∣zens and Merchants here, and they maintain a Traffick and Correspondence with divers Countries, especially by the convenience of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> They speak not the best <HI>High-dutch;</HI> but <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> are understood by many: Divers Hosts in Inns speak <HI>Latin,</HI> and the Ser∣vants <HI>French;</HI> which proves a good help unto Travellers. It was made an University about the year 1388. Besides the General Hospitals for young and old persons, there are two for the Sick, and well accommodated. They have a <HI>Pharmacopaea Coloniensis,</HI> or a <HI>Dispensatory</HI> proper to the place, whereby <HI>Apothecaries</HI> compound their Medicines. I was acquainted with one of the best, Mr. <HI>Elburg,</HI> a knowing and obliging person, who was his Majesties A∣pothecary while he resided at <HI>Colen,</HI> and whom my honoured Friend Sir <HI>Alexander Fraser,</HI> his Majesties chief Physician, made use of, who lived in great reputation in this City.</P>
<P>Two hundred years since <HI>Aeneas Sylvius</HI> left an high expression concerning this place, <HI>Coloniâ quae de conjuge</HI> Claudii <HI>matre</HI> Neronis, Agrippina <HI>dicta est, &amp; trium Magorum ossibus illustrata, nihil magnificentius, nihil orna∣tius, totâ</HI> Europâ <HI>reperias:</HI> which though, if strictly construed, will hardly be admitted by any who hath be∣held <HI>Paris, Naples, Venice,</HI> &amp;c. yet doth it declare the no∣bleness of this City, even in former times.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Colen</HI> about four a Clock in the Afternoon, be∣ing drawn up the Stream with Horses, they being made fast by a very long Rope to the Mast; we lodged in a small Village, having had a good prospect of <HI>Colen</HI> all this Evening from off the water. Near to this Place <HI>Ju∣lius Caesar</HI> made his Bridge over the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The next day we came to <HI>Bon,</HI> the Seat of the present Archbishop and Elector of <HI>Colen, Maximilianus Henricus,</HI> Duke of
<PB N="44" REF="25"/> <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hildisheim</HI> and <HI>Liege,</HI> and Arch-Chancellor of the Empire throughout <HI>Italy.</HI> This place was formerly called <HI>Bonna,</HI> or <HI>Castra Bonnensia,</HI> the win∣tering place, in the time of <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the sixth Legion. It was not long since very well fortified by the order of the present Archbishop, and the direction of Colonel <HI>Bi∣ser,</HI> a blind man, having <HI>Cataracts</HI> in both his eyes. The Archbishops Palace is very Noble, and there is a Cham∣ber seated a good way into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to which they pass thorow a Gallery. This Night we lodged at the foot of the highest of the seven Hills by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which are seen at a great distance; and upon divers of them stand old ruined Castles. On the <HI>15th</HI> we passed by a pleasant Island with a Convent in it: at <HI>Remagen</HI> is also a Con∣vent upon a Rock, fortified with round Towers. In the Evening we lodged near to a Castle, ruined four years before by the Electors of <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Colen,</HI> it belonging at that time to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> On the <HI>16th</HI> early in the Morning we came to <HI>Andernach,</HI> where the plague was very much at that time, and they kept a great many of their sick in Boats upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Andernach,</HI> of old <HI>Antenacum,</HI> was one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortresses. Upon this River, some think that <HI>Caligula</HI> was born, and that <HI>Valentinian</HI> was buried hereabouts. Near unto this place are also Mineral Springs, well fre∣quented, and much made use of. The Town is encompassed with an old Wall; and the Gates were shut up by reason of the Plague: Notwithstanding, there being divers Fri∣ers in our company, several of the Towns-men sent out dishes of Meat to them, which we eat in the Field upon Trees which were laid along near the Town. This day the passage by water seeming tedious to us, Mr. <HI>Mulstroth,</HI> a worthy <HI>German</HI> Gentleman, with whom I travelled as far as <HI>Spire,</HI> was willing we should hire a Coach toge∣ther,
<PB N="45" REF="25"/> which we did, and invited the Friers with whom we had breakfasted, to go along with us in it to <HI>Coblentz.</HI> We passed through a very pleasant Country, between rows of <HI>Walnut-trees,</HI> in sight of two of the Elector of <HI>Triers</HI> Houses, and near to a House belonging to the Count <HI>de Wert.</HI></P>
<P>We passed the <HI>Mosella</HI> over a hand some Stone-bridge of thirteen Arches, built by Archbishop <HI>Baldus,</HI> or <HI>Baldui∣nus,</HI> in the year 1344. and coming into the Town, we went to the <HI>Dominican</HI> Convent, which is pleasantly seated near the Banks of the River <HI>Mosella;</HI> but the Pri∣or of the Convent, whom we had brought with us, was so obliging, that he would not part with us that night; and we were very civilly entertained by him in his Lodg∣ings: He invited also some of the Convent to bear us company; and after a handsome Supper, with plenty of excellent <HI>Moselle</HI> wine, we went to bed between two Feather-beds.</P>
<P><HI>Coblentz,</HI> or <HI>Confluentia,</HI> is a Town of a Triangular Figure, seated at the meeting of two great Rivers, the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Mosella,</HI> which make two sides thereof, and the third is made by a Line drawn from one River to the other; which is now well fortified after the most re∣gular Modern way. The Wall within these Works had many old high Towers; and formerly there was another still nearer to the uniting of the Rivers, and consequent∣ly containing a less space of ground. This Town is un∣der the Elector and Archbishop of <HI>Triers, Carolus Caspar,</HI> of the Noble Family of the <HI>Leyen,</HI> Arch-Chancellour for the Empire in <HI>Gallia Belgica,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Arles.</HI> It was given to the Church of <HI>Triers</HI> when <HI>Me∣doaldus</HI> was Archbishop above a thousand years since, in the time of King <HI>Dagobert.</HI> The Situation is pleasant and convenient, and lieth over against the Castle of <HI>Her∣manstein,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="26"/> or <HI>Ehrenbreitstein,</HI> that is, <HI>The Stone of far extended Honour;</HI> at the foot of which Castle, upon the shoar of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> under a great Rock, stands a very Noble Palace of the Electors, two large Wings and the Front with five Pavilions standing towards the River, and from it a long Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Cob∣lentz:</HI> when any great Vessel passeth by, they let slip three Boats, whereby the passage lieth open, and make them fast again afterwards. In the <HI>German</HI> wars the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> thrust in a Garrison into this Town; which was af∣terwards beaten out by the <HI>Rhinegrave</HI> for the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> and the strong Castle of <HI>Ethrenbrietstein</HI> being put into the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> the Emperours For∣ces seized upon the Archbishop of <HI>Triers,</HI> who then was <HI>Philippus Christophorus,</HI> and carried him away to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>In places where the <HI>Rhine</HI> runneth through a low Coun∣try and a fat Soyl, it washeth away the Banks: to secure which, in divers places they have made great Works of Wood, and also to secure Vessels from the danger of the Ice. And I remember, riding near the Banks of the Ri∣ver <HI>Loire</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> I observed them in some places to be handsomly defended for a long way together with Free∣stone.</P>
<P>Near unto <HI>Coblentz,</HI> upon a Hill, is a Convent of <HI>Car∣thusians. October</HI> the <HI>17th</HI> we went up the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Bop∣part,</HI> a walled Town, upon the western bank, where <HI>Van Trump</HI> was at that time: It is a very old Town, one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortresses against the <HI>Germans,</HI> called anci∣ently <HI>Bodobriga;</HI> some would have it called <HI>Bopport</HI> from <HI>Beauport, Fair-haven,</HI> or <HI>Bonport,</HI> a good convenient place for Vessels to retire into, or to ride in.</P>
<P>On the <HI>18th</HI> we dined at St. <HI>Guer,</HI> a pleasant Town belonging to the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hesse,</HI> who hath a Castle
<PB N="47" REF="26"/> here. Coming on shoar we met with an odd custome: for upon the Wall side there is fastned a Collar of Brass at present, but was formerly of Lead, and given by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth; into this most Strangers that come put their Necks, at which time they ask them, <HI>Whether they will be sprinkled with water, or drink wine?</HI> and if they choose the latter, they give an entertainment of wine to the Company. The Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> passing by this place, gave a great Silver Cup, out of which they now drink at this Ceremony. We lodged this night at <HI>Wesel,</HI> a Town situated between a high Hill and the River, belonging to the Archbishop of <HI>Triers.</HI> Here in the Market-place they shew us the print of St. <HI>Huberts</HI> Hor∣ses foot in a Free-stone.</P>
<P>On the <HI>19th</HI> we came to <HI>Baccharach,</HI> or <HI>ad Bacchi aras,</HI> belonging to the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> a place famous for Ex∣cellent Wines. We passed by an old Castle seated upon a Rock in the middle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> being of an irregular figure, called <HI>Pfalts,</HI> where formerly the Prince <HI>Pala∣tines</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> were born, the Princesses being sent hither to be brought to Bed. We came this night to <HI>Dreickshausen;</HI> the next day we went by a dangerous Pas∣sage, there being many Rocks under water, which cause the River to run very rapid and unequally. A little a∣bove this we came to a round Tower, on a Rock in the <HI>Rhine,</HI> called the <HI>Mouse-tower,</HI> built by <HI>Hatto</HI> Archbi∣shop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> in the year 900. who, as the Story goeth, in a time of great Scarcity, pretending to relieve the poor who wanted bread, invited them together into a Barn, where he burnt them all, saying, <HI>They were like the Rats and Mice which would devour the Corn.</HI> After which he was so persecuted with Rats and Mice, that to avoid them he caused this Tower to be built in the middle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which did not avail him, for they followed him
<PB N="48" REF="27"/> thither also, and at last devoured him. A little above this lieth <HI>Bing</HI> upon the Western shoar; a considerable Town, belonging to the Elector of <HI>Mentz:</HI> here our Boat stayed to pay Custome, as it had done also at <HI>Bonna, Liutz, Hammerstein, Andernach, Coblentz, Lodesheim, Bopport,</HI> St. <HI>Gower, Cub,</HI> and <HI>Baccharach.</HI> For the trade of the <HI>Rhine</HI> being great, Princes and Lords, who have Towns upon it, make use of that advantage, which, though it abateth the gains of the Merchant, brings considerable profit to themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Bing,</HI> or <HI>Bingium,</HI> was an old <HI>Roman</HI> Fortress upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> where the River <HI>Navus</HI> or <HI>Naw</HI> entreth into it; over which latter there is a handsome Stone-bridge: In this Town were many of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Army sick and wounded, who three weeks before had main∣tained a fight against the Forces of the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> near this place. From <HI>Bing</HI> we continued our Journey to <HI>Mentz:</HI> at <HI>Rudesheim</HI> in <HI>Rhinegaw,</HI> a place noted for good Wine, they shewed us a Boy, whose hair was thick and woolly, like to the <HI>African-</HI>Moors, but of a fine white colour, which being somewhat an odd sight, I took away some of his hair with me.</P>
<P><HI>Mentz, Moguntia, Moguntiacum,</HI> and by the <HI>French Mayence,</HI> is seated over against the Confluence of the Ri∣ver <HI>Main,</HI> with the <HI>Rhine,</HI> or rather a little below it; in a fertile Country, abounding in all Provisions and good Wine; it lieth at length, and is most extended towards the River; and that part excelleth the other towards the Land, which is not so populous or well-built: It is a strong place, and well guarded; it hath many Churches and Monasteries, and some fair Buildings, especially those of publick concern, as the Palace of the Elector, and o∣thers: But the narrowness of the Streets, and many old Houses, take away much from the beauty of the City.
<PB N="49" REF="27"/> It is an University, begun about the year 1486. or as o∣thers will have it 1461. This place also challengeth the Invention of Printing, or at least the first promotion or perfection thereof: And the Territory about it is famous for the destruction of the <HI>Roman</HI> Legions under <HI>Varus,</HI> by the <HI>Germans. Gustaphus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was wonderfully pleased upon the taking of this City, 1631. entring into it in State upon the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> it be∣ing his Birth-day, which began the <HI>38th</HI> year of his life, and kept his Court and <HI>Christmas</HI> here; where at one time there were with him six chief Princes of the Empire, twelve Ambassadours of Kings, States, Electors, and Princes; besides Dukes and Lords, and the Martial men of his own Army. At the taking of the Town, they found great store of Ordnance and Powder; and the City re∣deemed it self from Pillage by giving the King a Ransome of Eighty thousand <HI>Dollars;</HI> and the Clergy and Jews gave Two and twenty thousand more, of which the Jews paid Eighteen thousand; Archbishop <HI>Wambold</HI> saving himself upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and retiring to <HI>Colen.</HI> The King caused also two great Bridges to be made, one over the <HI>Main,</HI> founded upon fifteen great flat bottom'd Boats, the rest being built upon great Piles of Wood: Another over the <HI>Rhine</HI> supported by sixty one great flat Boats, each lying the distance of an Arch from one another; and many Families of people living sometimes in the Boats un∣der the Bridge. The Bridge over the <HI>Main</HI> is taken a∣way; but that over the <HI>Rhine</HI> is still continued: Upon which I saw the present Elector passing in his Coach; a Person of great Gravity, of a middle Stature, having long grey Hair, and was very Princely attended; his Name <HI>Joannes Philippus</HI> of the Noble Family of <HI>Schoen∣burg,</HI> Elector and Archbishop of <HI>Mentz</HI> Bishop of <HI>Wurtz∣burg,</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Worms,</HI> Arch-Chancellour of the
<PB N="50" REF="28"/> Empire for all <HI>Germany;</HI> the first of the <HI>Electoral Colledge;</HI> in all publick Conventions he sits at the right hand of the Emperour, and is a Successour of the famous <HI>Boniface,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> man, Bishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> who so much promo∣ted the Christian <HI>Religion</HI> in these parts. But though his Dignity and Place excelleth the two other Ecclesiastical Electors of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>Triers,</HI> yet his Territories come short; and they lye not together, but scatteringly with those of the <HI>Palatinate, Spier, Franckfort,</HI> and divers places in <HI>Franconia.</HI> But of late he hath much encreased his Power, by seizing the great City of <HI>Erfurdt</HI> in <HI>Turingia,</HI> which he hath since much beautified and strength∣ned by a Citadel built upon St. <HI>Peters hill.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Mentz</HI> I passed by water up the River <HI>Main,</HI> to <HI>Franckfort,</HI> a free City of the Empire, called <HI>Trajectum Franconum,</HI> a Passage or Ford of the <HI>Franks,</HI> as serving them for a Retreat, when they entred or returned from <HI>Gaul;</HI> at present <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the <HI>Main,</HI> to differ∣ence it from <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the River <HI>Oder,</HI> which is an University: It is a large Town, divided into two parts by the River; the lesser called <HI>Saxonhausen,</HI> or <HI>Saxon∣houses,</HI> united to the other by a Stone-bridge over the <HI>Main,</HI> of twelve or thirteen Arches. It is a place of good Trade, and well seated for it, as having the ad∣vantage of the River <HI>Main,</HI> which passeth by <HI>Bamberg, Schweinfurt, Wurtzburg, Guemund,</HI> or <HI>Gaudia mundi;</HI> and also the <HI>Tauber,</HI> and other Rivers running into it, af∣fordeth conveniency for Commerce with the remoter parts of <HI>Franconia;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> running into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> makes a large communication both up and down that Stream.</P>
<P>But this place is most remarkable for the Election of the Emperour, which, by the Laws of the <HI>Golden Bull,</HI> should be in this City, as also for two great Marts or
<PB N="51" REF="28"/> Fairs kept in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> at which times there is an extraordinary concourse of people from remote parts, in order to buying and selling of several Commo∣dities, especially for Books, as well printed here as in other parts, whereof they afford two Catalogues every year, and have no small dealings that way, by the Fa∣ctors of the <HI>Germans, Hollanders, Italians, French,</HI> and <HI>English:</HI> although at other times their trading in Books seems not great; for when I was there out of the time of the Mart, the <HI>Stationers</HI> Shops being shut up, made but a dull show. Here are also a great number of good Horses bought and sold: and on the North-side of the City there is a spacious place for a Horse-Fair. The City is strong and well fortified; and most part of the Town are <HI>Luthe∣rans.</HI> In the <HI>German</HI> wars, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having taken <HI>Hanaw,</HI> sent a Messenger to <HI>Franckfort</HI> to know whether the City would peaceably and speedily set open their Gates unto him, and accept fairly of a Garrison, or stand to the hazard of a Siege: And although they were unwilling to yield, yet for fear of the worst, they con∣sented, That the King should have free passage for his Army through the City; and that for the better assurance of it, six hundred of his men should be received for a Garrison into <HI>Saxonhausen;</HI> and also that the Magistrates and People should take an Oath unto his Majesty. So that upon the <HI>17th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1631. the King's Army pas∣sed through <HI>Saxonhausen</HI> over the Bridge, quite through the Town. Colonel <HI>Vitzthumb</HI> was left Governour in <HI>Saxonhausen;</HI> and the King himself rode bare-headed through the Streets: and by his obliging behaviour did generally win the affections of the beholders; and three days after returned thither again with the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hessen-Cassell,</HI> and the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hessen-Darmstadt,</HI> where they met the Seventeen Earls of the <HI>Wetteraw,</HI> or
<PB N="52" REF="29"/> <HI>Veteravia,</HI> and were feasted in the same room where the Emperours at their Coronation use to be entertain∣ed.</P>
<P>In <HI>Saxonhausen</HI> there is a House anciently belonging unto the Knights of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, which hath the priviledge of a Sanctuary for Man-slayers and Bankrupts; but it is a security but for fourteen days. Upon this side there is the largest portion of Land belonging to <HI>Franck∣fort;</HI> on the other side very little.</P>
<P>This being a trading place, it is no wonder that there are so many Jews in it; for a distinction they wear great Ruffs, their Sons Bonnets, and their Wives a peculiar dress of their Head.</P>
<P>The Collegiate Church of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> where ma∣ny of the Emperours have been crowned, is large, hath a high Steeple, and is built of a red stone. There are divers handsome Fountains in the Town, and good Hou∣ses; in one of the best of which liveth Monsieur <HI>Pierre Neufville,</HI> a great Merchant, and a civil worthy person, well known in most places of Commerce; who obliged me with Letters to <HI>Venice,</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>From <HI>Franckfort</HI> I continued my Journey through the <HI>Bergstraes,</HI> passing by <HI>Darmstadt,</HI> which belongs to one of the Brothers of the House of <HI>Hessen,</HI> commonly known by the name of the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hessen Darmstadt;</HI> and afterwards through a fruitful plain Country, in the sight of Hills, and sometimes near them: the whole Country planted with Wallnut-trees, Vines, Corn, and in some places with Tobacco; till I arrived at <HI>Heidelberg.</HI></P>
<P>In coming into this Town we passed over the River <HI>Neccar, Nicer,</HI> or <HI>Necarus,</HI> upon a Bridge covered over from one end to another, with a large Roof of Wood: in the same manner is the long Bridge covered at the en∣trance of the City of <HI>Alessandria della paglia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<PB N="53" REF="29"/>
<P>The River <HI>Neccar</HI> ariseth near the <HI>Sylva Martiana,</HI> now <HI>Swartzwald,</HI> or <HI>Black Forest,</HI> and passing through the Territories of the Duke of <HI>Wittenberg,</HI> runneth into the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Manheim:</HI> This, though none of the great∣est, yet is a considerable River of <HI>Germany;</HI> and hath di∣vers good Towns upon it and near it, as <HI>Sultz, Tubingen, Wirtingen, Essingen, Stutgard, Canstat, Lauffen, Hallbrun, Heidelberg.</HI></P>
<P>There being wars at that time when I was in this Coun∣try, between the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lo∣rain:</HI> The Elector resided for the most part at <HI>Franken∣dale,</HI> to be near his Forces.</P>
<P><HI>Heidelberg</HI> is seated on the South-side of the River <HI>Neccar,</HI> between it and a ridge of high Hills, so as it cannot well admit of a modern Fortification, or hope to be extraordinary strong, as being over-looked by the ad∣jacent Mountains: It lieth most at length from East to West: It hath been an University since the year 1346. at which time it was begun by <HI>Rupertus,</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and at present is much frequented. In the great Church was kept the famous Library, which, after that the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> had taken this Town 1620. was carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> and added to the <HI>Vatican,</HI> where I saw it in the year 1664. being placed upon one side of a very long Gallery be∣longing to the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library; and the Duke of <HI>Urbin</HI>'s Library placed on the otherside, over-against it: both which made a notable addition to the Papal Library. In this Church and the Church also of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> are divers Monuments of Princes of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Family, and of Learned and Famous Men. The <HI>French</HI> have a Church here, and the present Elector is of the Order of the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> and his Son a Mareschal of <HI>France:</HI> and good <HI>French</HI> and <HI>High-dutch</HI> are both generally spoken here. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have also a Church in this Town, by the
<PB N="54" REF="30"/> favour of the present Elector; although he himself be a <HI>Calvinist:</HI> and to express his generous kindness the higher in this point, the first Stone was laid by himself and his Son; and it is called the <HI>Church of Providence,</HI> according to the Elector's Motto, <HI>Dominus Providebit.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Town-house is a Clock with divers Moti∣ons, and when the Clock strikes, the figure of an Old man pulls off his hat, a Cock crows, and shakes his wings, Souldiers fight with one another, and the like. The Prince's Stables for above a hundred Horses are seat∣ed upon the River very conveniently, but were fairer formerly, above half thereof having been ruined by the Imperialists; as also divers of the Statues on the out∣side of the Castle, which is seated high above the Town.</P>
<P>The present Elector is <HI>Carolus Ludovicus,</HI> Son to the King of <HI>Bohemia, Frederick</HI> the Fifth; he was born in the year 1617. and passed his Youth an Exile from his Fathers Kingdom and Electorate: and at the pacification at <HI>Prague</HI> 1635. he was excluded from any restitution to be made to him. But at length, in the Treaty of <HI>Mun∣ster</HI> 1648. he was restored to the lower <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and 1652. returned to the possession of his Fortunes: a highly accomplished Prince, much honoured and beloved by his Subjects. In the year 1650. he married <HI>Charlotta,</HI> Daughter to <HI>William</HI> the Fifth, <HI>Landgrave,</HI> and to the famous <HI>Amelia Elizabeth, Landgravess</HI> of <HI>Hassia;</HI> by whom he had the <HI>Chur</HI> Prince, or Electoral Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and a Daughter, the Princess <HI>Charlotta Elizabetha;</HI> but up∣on some discontent the Princess Electress since returned to her own Friends and Country. This Elector is also Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, Great Treasurer of the Empire, and together with the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> Vicar of the Empire.</P>

<P>In his Palace or Castle at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> are divers things remarkable; a very great Tower to be equalled by very few; within which is a Theatre for Comedies. This was formerly called <HI>Trutzkaisar,</HI> or the Tower that bad Defi∣ance, or threatned the Emperor; but since the Restaura∣tion of the Elector, there are some Works drawn about it in the figure of a Star, and the old disobliging Name is by Proclamation forbidden to be continued, and it is at present called the <HI>Sternschanz,</HI> or the <HI>Star-fort.</HI> By it is a handsome Garden; in the Ditch whereof there was then kept a great Bear, and a very large Wolf. The Grotto's and Water-works are very handsome: they were also making divers others, having the advantage of the side of the Hill to bring down the water, and to make Grots and Caves in the Rock. Amongst other Fountains, that of the Lions head with a Frog in his Ear, is taken notice of. The Cellars are very large and cool, filled with Vessels of no ordinary size; yet inconsiderable, if com∣pared to the great Tun kept in a great Building joyning to the Cellars; it was built by this present Elector's Or∣der, 1664. and goeth far beyond any made before: It contains 204 Faiders and odd measure, or about two hundred Tuns: instead of Hoops it is built with large knee Timber, like the ribs of a Ship, which are painted and carved, and have divers Inscriptions upon them, and supported by carved Pedistals. Upon one side of it is a handsome Staircase to ascend to the top of the Ves∣sel; upon the top of which is a Gallery set round with Ballisters, three and forty steps high from the ground.</P>
<P>About an <HI>English</HI> mile from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> between the Hills, is a solitary place, where three large Streams or Springs gush out of the Mountain, and presently fill five Ponds, have three handsome Cascates or Falls, and after run into the Plain, and are strong enough in a
<PB N="56" REF="31"/> small space to turn four Mills; this is called <HI>Wolfsbrun,</HI> or the <HI>Wolfs Fountain,</HI> from a Princess who formerly re∣tired into a Cave in this desart place, and was here de∣voured by a <HI>Wolf.</HI></P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> two <HI>English</HI> men came kind∣ly to me, Mr. <HI>Villers,</HI> and <HI>Timothy Middleton,</HI> belonging to <HI>Lobensfeldt Cloister,</HI> a Convent formerly of the Jesu∣its, but since let out to about an hundred <HI>English,</HI> who left their Country 1661. came up the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and by the permission of the Elector, setled themselves a few miles from hence, living altogether, men, women, and chil∣dren, in one House; and having a community of many things: They are of a peculiar Religion, calling them∣selves Christian Jews; and one Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> formerly li∣ving at <HI>Norwich,</HI> is their Head. They cut not their Beards, and observe many other Ceremonies and Duties, which they either think themselves obliged to from some Expressions in the Old Testament, or from some New Ex∣position of their Leaders.</P>
<P>From <HI>Heidelberg</HI> I made an excursion, and had a sight of <HI>Spire,</HI> seated in a Plain, on the West-side of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> a place of Antiquity, conceived to be <HI>Urbs Nemetum</HI> of old; a large place and populous. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> wars demolished the Works about it, not willing to spare so great a number of his Souldiers as was required to Garrison it, and make it good. It is an Episcopal See under the Archbishop of <HI>Mentz:</HI> there are many fair Houses in it, divers Churches, and a fair Cathedral, with four large Towers. The <HI>Romanists,</HI> the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> preach in it at several hours. It is the more populous, and filled with people of good quality, by reason of the concourse of persons from o∣ther parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> for the decision of Law Suits: For here the Imperial Chamber is held, and many differ∣ences
<PB N="57" REF="31"/> which arise in the Empire are determined, and the Electors and other Princes, in some tryals at Law, may be called hither. It is a settled Court, which <HI>Maximi∣lian</HI> the First, for the better ease of all persons, placed first at <HI>Worms,</HI> and not long after it was fixed at <HI>Spire,</HI> from whence it cannot be now removed, but by the con∣sent of all the Estates. Things Cognoscible in this Court are determined by an Imperial Judge, and sealed with the Emperours Arms, so that there lieth no appeal unto the Emperour.</P>
<P>Another day I went to <HI>Manheim,</HI> formerly a Village, seated at the Confluence of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Neccar;</HI> but walled about by the Elector <HI>Frederick</HI> the Fourth, and since is much encreased; all the Streets being large and uniform, and a Noble Citadel built; within which, over∣against the Gate, the Elector designs a Palace, the Model of which I saw: and at present, on the right hand, there are three Pavilions of Lodgings: in one of which lodgeth the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> in another the Prince his Son; and in the third the Princess his Daughter: behind these there is a handsome Garden and Lodgings for <HI>Degen Felderen,</HI> the <HI>Churfursts</HI> Mistress. Here are some good Pictures, as a Head of <HI>Hans Holben,</HI> and a Landskip with the Sto∣ry of the Union of the <HI>Swissers.</HI> The Bridge over the Moat of the Citadel into the Town, is also remarkable, as having six Draw-bridges upon it, three great ones, and three small ones on the side. There are Palisado's all a∣long the bottom, in the middle of the Ditch, and with∣out upon the <HI>Esplanade.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Heidelberg</HI> I travelled to <HI>Nurnberg</HI> in the Compa∣ny of Captain <HI>Wagenseyl,</HI> who had been in the <HI>Polish</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> wars, and was employed a little before in blowing up the Castle of <HI>Launsteyn,</HI> belonging to the E∣lector <HI>Palatine,</HI> to prevent its surprisal by the Duke of
<PB N="58" REF="32"/> <HI>Lorrain.</HI> He was then employed to raise a Company at <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> for the Service of the Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI> I had a good advantage in my Journey by his Company; for he travelled with Authority, and was a generous, knowing, and courteous person.</P>
<P>The first day we travelled near to the <HI>Neccar,</HI> in stony and rocky way; and it being dark before we came to <HI>Mospach,</HI> the Peasants conducted us from Village to Vil∣lage with bundles of lighted Straw.</P>
<P>The next day we came to <HI>Poxberg,</HI> where there is an old Castle, and in the afternoon reached <HI>Morkenthal,</HI> or <HI>Mergetheim,</HI> the Seat of the Grand Master of the <HI>Herrhn Deutchern,</HI> or the <HI>Teutonick Order.</HI> The Town is well∣built, hath a fair <HI>Piazza,</HI> with a large Fountain in it, and a Statue of one of the Grand Masters, with a long <HI>Corridore</HI> from his Palace. This Order hath been of great Fame, and hath had large Possessions, as may be seen in the exact Account of the <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> of <HI>Prussia,</HI> made out from the best Authors, by my worthy honoured Friend Mr. <HI>Ashmole,</HI> in his Noble Description of the Order of the Garter; and as <HI>Lewis du May,</HI> Counsellor unto the Duke of <HI>Wirtenberg,</HI> hath set it down. <HI>For the Knights Templars and of St.</HI> John, <HI>having fought prosperously against the Infidels, raised an Emulation in some</HI> German <HI>Gentlemen, who waited upon the Emperour</HI> Frederick <HI>the First, in his Expedition to the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>to take the</HI> Croisado. <HI>And because they were installed in the Church and Hospital of St.</HI> Mary <HI>at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>they were called</HI> Marianites. <HI>Their Order differed nothing from those above-mentioned, but in the form and colour of their Cross, and was approved by Pope</HI> Celestin <HI>the Third. Afterwards when</HI> Jerusalem <HI>was ta∣ken by</HI> Saladin, <HI>those Knights betook themselves to</HI> Ptole∣mais, <HI>from whence the Emperour</HI> Frederick <HI>the Second, sent them back into</HI> Germany, <HI>and employed them against the</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="32"/> Prussians <HI>and</HI> Livonians, <HI>who at that time were still Pa∣gans. But by the Valour and Piety of those Knights, their Souls were brought into subjection to Christ, and their Bo∣dies to the Order which began that war in the year 1220. a little while after these Knights found themselves Ma∣sters of a Country of very large Extent, which obeyed the Order, till the year 1525. at which time</HI> Sigismond, <HI>King of</HI> Poland, <HI>gave the investiture of</HI> Prussia <HI>unto</HI> Albert <HI>Mar∣quiss of</HI> Brandenburg. <HI>In the year 1563. the Great Ma∣ster became Secular again, and took a part of the Lands sub∣ject to the Order, with the name of Duke of</HI> Curland. <HI>And</HI> Livonia <HI>having been the Subject and Theatre of many wars between the</HI> Polanders, Muscovites, <HI>and</HI> Swedes; <HI>these last did at length become Masters of it, and have it in possession still. So that there is no more remaining of the</HI> Teutonick Order, <HI>but some Commanderies scattered here and there in</HI> Germany. <HI>And the Great Master hath his Seat and Resi∣dence at</HI> Mergenthal.</P>
<P>They wear on a white Mantle a plain black Cross. The Dignity of Grand Master is generally held by some Great and Honorable Person; and in the Great Assembly he ta∣keth place of all Bishops. The present is the Baron of <HI>Am∣ring;</HI> and the Grand Master before him was <HI>Leopold Wil∣liam,</HI> only Brother to the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Lauterbach,</HI> near which we passed through a Wood, and found a Noble Church up∣on the top of a high Hill, which being much frequented by Pilgrims, they have made handsome stone Stairs from the bottom to the top: then to <HI>Rotenburg,</HI> and lodged at <HI>Burgperner,</HI> and the next day by <HI>Schantzbach</HI> we came to <HI>Nurenberg. Rotenburg</HI> is an Imperial City, which some have likened unto <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for its Situation upon hilly places, and many Turrets in it. It is Situated near
<PB N="60" REF="33"/> the head of the River <HI>Tauber,</HI> which may be accounted the second River of <HI>Franconia,</HI> passing by <HI>Rottingen, Lan∣den,</HI> and <HI>Werthaim,</HI> where it runneth into the <HI>Main.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nurenberg</HI> is the fairest City that I saw in <HI>Germany;</HI> the Houses most of them of Free-stone, very high; and divers of them painted on the outside, and adorned with gilded Balls on the top; many are of six or seven Stories high. <HI>Der Herr Peller</HI> hath one of the fairest. The City is very populous and full of Trade, although it stands in a barren Country, and wants a Navigable River. The three best Churches are the <HI>Hospital Church,</HI> lately built very fair; St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> which is very large, with two high Steeples in the Front; and St. <HI>Sebald</HI> the best of the three. The Body of St. <HI>Sebald</HI> being laid upon a Cart drawn with Oxen, in that place where the Oxen stood still, they buried the Body, and erected this Church in his memory. In this Church is a Crucifix of Wood, very well carved, and esteemed at a high rate. The Cru∣cifix without the Church is very great, and of a black colour: and some fancy that the <HI>Raht Herrn,</HI> or Magi∣strates of the Town, have reposited a Treasure within it. The Pulpit is well carved and gilded, and the whole Church so stately, that it may pass in the first rank of <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches; that Religion being here practised in its splendour. The Priest every morning reads the Scripture to the people for half an hour, or preacheth a Sermon. The Town-house is well worth the seeing: In it the Hall is spacious, as also the Chambers, and furnish∣ed with good Pictures, and Stones well gilded and pain∣ted with white and gold, green and gold, dark coloured and gold, and the like. There is one Picture of most of the Great Persons in <HI>Germany</HI> entertained in the Great Hall; another of the three Brothers of <HI>Saxony;</HI> one of an Elephant as big as the life; a piece of St. <HI>John</HI> and
<PB N="61" REF="33"/> St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and another of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> both by <HI>Albert Durer:</HI> but the most rare piece is that of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> by the same Master, with this Inscription:
<Q>Albertus Durer Almang faciebat post Virginis partum, 1507.</Q> Another excellent one is that of St. <HI>Luke</HI> drawing the Picture of our Saviour and the blessed Virgin. Over the Gate at the entrance of the Shambles is a large Oxe carved in Wood, and painted over, with this Inscrip∣tion:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Omnia habent ortus suaque incrementa, sed ecce</HI></L>
<L><HI>Quem cernis, nunquam Bos fuit hic, Vitulus.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Castle standeth upon a high Hill, from whence the Town makes a handsome show: In it are observable a very deep well, the Emperors Chappel, his Picture, and the Pictures of the Electors; good Night pieces; and one of a man behind a white Curtain transparent, very well expressed. The Armour of <HI>Hebbele van Gailinghen</HI> the great Sorcerer is here shown; and in the Wall of the Ca∣stle the marks of his Horses feet, when he leaped from thence over the <HI>Town ditch.</HI></P>
<P>The new Fountain was not then finished; but the Sta∣tua's in Brass made for it were excellent; the Sea-Horses large, the Sea-Nymphs much bigger than the life; and <HI>Neptune,</HI> who was to stand on the top, is above three yards and a half high. When I came first into this place, I was not a little surprized to behold the fairness of the Houses, handsome Sreets, different Habits, industrious People, and neatness in all things, more than I had ob∣served in <HI>German</HI> Cities before; and no place hath grea∣ter number of curious Artificers in Steel, Brass, Ivory,
<PB N="62" REF="34"/> Wood, wherein they work at an extraordinary cheap rate; and there are Officers to inspect and enquire into the works of Artificers, that they be true, perfect, and without fraud: they make strong and handsome Clock∣work. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> presented the Grand Signi∣or with a very noble Clock, who took so much delight in it, that when it required some mending (the <HI>Turks</HI> be∣ing ignorant in Clock-work) he sent it from <HI>Adrianople</HI> as far as <HI>Nurenburg,</HI> to be set in order again.</P>
<P><HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was more magnifi∣cently received and entertained in this City, than in any other of <HI>Germany;</HI> which so incensed <HI>Wallensteyn,</HI> that he afterwards encamped before their Town, and did great spoil upon their Territories: But the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> marched thither towards their Relief, and from thence towards <HI>Lutzen,</HI> where in a bloody Battel he lost his life.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Pegnitz</HI> runneth through <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> and hath divers Stone Bridges over it; and below the Town, joyning with the River <HI>Rednitz,</HI> runneth into the River <HI>Main</HI> at <HI>Bamberg;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> runs at last into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The <HI>Reduitz</HI> ariseth at <HI>Weissenberg,</HI> and is not far from the River <HI>Altmul,</HI> which runneth into the <HI>Da∣nube,</HI> towards <HI>Regensburg.</HI> Upon this convenience, <HI>Charles</HI> the Great designed to make a Communication of passage between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and made a <HI>Canale</HI> thirty paces broad between the <HI>Rednitz</HI> and the <HI>Altmul,</HI> to joyn those Streams for the commodity of Pas∣sage by Boat; but after he had proceeded two <HI>German</HI> miles in this work, Boggs, Rains, and his warlike Di∣versions made him give over that noble Design, whereby there might have been a Commerce by water, from the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and even unto the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI></P>
<PB N="63" REF="34"/>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Lieutenant in <HI>Nero</HI>'s time, had a desire to unite the River <HI>Soane</HI> and the <HI>Mosella;</HI> and to make a passage between the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and the <HI>German</HI> Oce∣an; having been at the mouth of the <HI>Mosella</HI> by <HI>Coblentz,</HI> and passed from <HI>Chaalon</HI> upon the soft and noble River <HI>Araris</HI> or <HI>Soane</HI> unto <HI>Lyon,</HI> I cannot but think these ve∣ry goodly Streams, and fit for such a purpose. The present King of <HI>France</HI> hath a design to unite the River <HI>Aude</HI> with the <HI>Garonne,</HI> and so to have a passage by Boat from the <HI>Mediterranean Sea</HI> by <HI>Tholouse</HI> and <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> into the Ocean. When I travelled in those parts, view∣ing the Country well, I thought it would be a difficult work, and so it proveth: but the King hath proceeded already very far therein.</P>
<P>About four Leagues from <HI>Nurnberg</HI> lyeth <HI>Altdorff,</HI> be∣longing unto it, made an University in the year 1623. con∣taining, when I was there, about 150 Scholars. The Physick Garden is handsome, and well stocked with Plants, to the number of two thousand. Dr. <HI>Hoffman</HI> the <HI>Botanick</HI> and <HI>Anatomick Professour,</HI> shew'd me many of the most rare of them; and presented me with divers. The <HI>Anatomy</HI> School is not large; yet the only one in those parts of <HI>Germany:</HI> And they have divers Curiosities pre∣served in it, as the <HI>Skeleton</HI> of a Hart, of a Horse, of a Man, of a Bear bigger than a Horse: And some Pictures, as one of a <HI>Ninivite,</HI> and another of <HI>Moses,</HI> which they take to be Ancient. Dr. <HI>Wagenseyl,</HI> Professour of Law and History, brother to Captain <HI>Wagenseyl,</HI> who travel∣led with me from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> invited us to lodge at his House, and shew'd me his Library, and all his Rarities and Coyns, whereof he hath a good Collection, having lived in most places of <HI>Europe,</HI> and speaks many Lan∣guages well; he gave me a piece of the first mony that was coined in <HI>Germany.</HI> In the University Library I
<PB N="64" REF="35"/> saw a fair <HI>Hortus Eystetensis,</HI> and <HI>Youngerman</HI>'s Colle∣ction of Plants by his own hand.</P>
<P>At <HI>Nurnberg</HI> I met with the Son and the Secretary to the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador in <HI>Turky,</HI> who had travelled hi∣ther over-land from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in their return into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> travelling in <HI>Greek</HI> Habits.</P>
<P>From hence I went to <HI>Newmarkt,</HI> a good Town in the upper <HI>Palatinate</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the next day through <HI>Heinmaw,</HI> subject to the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> to <HI>Regensburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ratisbona, Regensburg, Augusta Tiberii, Colonia Quarta∣norum,</HI> the chief place of the <HI>Roman</HI> Forces in this limit of the Empire, where the fourth <HI>Italick</HI> Legion had a constant station; was made a Colony by <HI>Tiberius</HI> in the year, as some conceive, of the Passion of our Saviour. It was much augmented and adorned by the Emperour <HI>Arnulphus,</HI> who had a great affection for this place, so pleasantly seated, and in a good Country. Here the River <HI>Regen</HI> runs into the <HI>Danube;</HI> from whence it was called <HI>Regensburg.</HI> There are two Bridges, one of wood below the Town, and another Bridge of stone of about fifteen Arches; which is the fairest stone Bridge o∣ver the <HI>Danube.</HI> It is an Imperial City, but not with∣out some acknowledgment to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria:</HI> And although it be strongly fortified, yet it was taken by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> wars. There are many fair build∣ings in it, both private and publick; and though I am not able to confirm what some report, that there as many Churches and Chappels in this City, as there are dayes in the year; yet are there many fair Churches and Convents: As the Cathedral of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> in the South-side of which is the Picture of St. <HI>Peter</HI> in a ship; and on the North a∣other of the Apostles first Mission. In the <HI>Piazza</HI> stands a neat little Church, the Convent of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> founded
<PB N="65" REF="35"/> by St. <HI>Wolfgangus</HI> Bishop of this place, the Convent of St. <HI>Emerammus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> a Saint of great Ve∣neration here, though but of little mention or name in o∣ther parts. The name of <HI>Albertus Magnus,</HI> Bishop of this place, hath also added unto the Fame of <HI>Regensburg.</HI></P>
<P>But that which chiefly promoteth its lustre, is the General Diet or Parliament, which is often held in this City, and is not to be called in any part out of <HI>Germany;</HI> and the place is not unfit for the accommodation of such a noble Convention, as are the Estates of <HI>Germany.</HI> The Vice-Marshal taketh care to provide Lodgings respe∣ctively to their persons, and seeth that all things be brought hither, and at a just price; that the Hall or Place of Assembly be furnished and adorned sutably to the dignity of the Persons convened, and hath an especi∣al eye and regard towards the Publick safety. By this Convention the great Concerns of <HI>Germany</HI> are much secured, and their peace and quiet Established. Wherein <HI>Germany</HI> seems to have a better advantage than <HI>Italy;</HI> For <HI>Italy</HI> being likewise divided into many Dominions and Principalities, hath no Common Diet or Great Council, whereby to proceed for their Publick safety: Which makes them often so divided in their common Concerns in times of Danger, and when they most need a joynt Combination.</P>
<P>I entred the notable River <HI>Danubius</HI> at this place, which hath already run a good course, and passed by ma∣ny fair Towns or Cities; as the large City of <HI>Ulme</HI> in <HI>Swabenland,</HI> where it beginneth to be Navigable; as also <HI>Donawert, Neuburg,</HI> and <HI>Ingolstadt,</HI> and hath already received the considerable River of <HI>Licus</HI> or <HI>Leck,</HI> where∣by the Commodities of that great Trading City of <HI>Augs∣burg</HI> are brought into it. When I first embarked at <HI>Re∣gensburg,</HI> I thought I might have taken leave of the <HI>Da∣nube</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="36"/> not far below <HI>Vienna,</HI> but an opportunity made me see this great Stream beyond <HI>Belgrade,</HI> as I have declared in another Account of my Travels.</P>
<P>The first day we passed by <HI>Thonawsteyn,</HI> where there is a Castle seated upon a high Rock, and came to <HI>Pfeter</HI> or <HI>Vetera Castra</HI> of old, now but an ordinary place. The Boats upon the <HI>Danube</HI> are generally painted black and white, are flat bottom'd, and broad at the Head and Stern; there is a Chamber built in the middle; and the Rudder is very large, to be able to command the Boat where the River is rapid, and of a swift Course.</P>
<P>The next day we came to <HI>Straubing,</HI> a handsome walled Town, belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> the Streets are streight; and there is a Tower in the Market-place, painted all over with green and gold-colour: There is also a Bridge of wood over the <HI>Danube.</HI> We passed by <HI>Swartz</HI> in the Afternoon, where the Church is seated up∣on a Hill, and is frequented by Pilgrims, and lodged at <HI>Deckendorff,</HI> where there is another Bridge. Near this Town comes into the <HI>Danube</HI> that considerable River <HI>Iser,</HI> or <HI>Isara,</HI> having passed by divers considerable Towns; as <HI>Landshut, Frising,</HI> and <HI>München,</HI> the Seat of <HI>Ferdinan∣dus Maria,</HI> Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Great Steward of the Empire, and at present the first of the Secular Electors, and he is to take place immediately after the King of <HI>Bo∣hemia,</HI> it being so concluded on at the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI> where <HI>Maximilian</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was allowed to hold the Electorship, which was confirmed upon him by the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, when he excluded <HI>Frederick</HI> the Fifth, Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and in lieu hereof there was an eighth Electorship erected for the <HI>Palatinate</HI> Family, who also, if the <HI>Bavarian</HI> branch doth fail, are to re-enter into their ancient Electorship, and the other newly erected is to be abolished.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="36"/>
<P><HI>Thursday, November</HI> the fifteenth, we came by <HI>Wilsho∣ven</HI> to <HI>Passaw, Patavia,</HI> or <HI>Boiodurum,</HI> a long and no∣ble City in the lower <HI>Bavaria,</HI> or <HI>Bayern,</HI> made up of three Towns, <HI>Iltstadt, Passaw,</HI> and <HI>Innstadt,</HI> at the con∣currence of the River <HI>Inne,</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> and the <HI>Iltz.</HI> As Towns are commonly of great Antiquity which are built at the Confluence of great Rivers, for the Strength of the Situation and convenience of Commerce; so is this accounted ancient, as being a <HI>Roman</HI> Co∣lony, and the place of the <HI>Castra Batava</HI> in old times.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Stephen</HI> is stately, besides other fair Churches. The Bishop, who is Lord of the City, hath a strong Palace upon a Hill; his Revenues are large, and besides what he possesseth hereabouts, he hath the tenth part of the notable great Lead-Mine at <HI>Bleyberg</HI> in <HI>Carinthia.</HI> This place had lately suffered much by fire; but a good part was rebuilt, and very fairly after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner: So that this may well be reckoned as one of the ten considerable Cities, which are upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> accounting from <HI>Ulme</HI> unto <HI>Bel∣grade,</HI> as <HI>Ulme, Ingolstadt, Ratisbone, Passaw, Lintz, Vienna, Presburg, Strigonium, Buda, Belgrade;</HI> all which from <HI>Ratisbone</HI> I had the opportunity to see be∣fore the end of my Journey. Near to a Wall over a∣gainst the great Church at <HI>Passaw,</HI> which was then re∣pairing, I saw a vast Head cut in stone, the Mouth whereof was two spans wide, and the rest proportion∣able. The River <HI>Iltz,</HI> which runneth in here from the North, is considerable for the Pearls which are found in it; and the noble River <HI>Inne</HI> or <HI>Oenus,</HI> from the South, is the greatest River which hath yet entred the <HI>Danube;</HI> having passed by <HI>Insbrug,</HI> and taken in the River <HI>Saltz,</HI> upon which stands <HI>Saltzburg;</HI> and a∣rising in the <HI>Alpes</HI> in such a high Country as <HI>Tirolis,</HI>

The other is the <HI>Wurbel,</HI> or a kind of a Whirlpool, where the water turneth about with great force, being hindred in its direct Course by a great Rock.

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF VIENNA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>IENNA,</HI> or <HI>Wien,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Berch,</HI> is the chief City of <HI>Austria,</HI> in the Latitude of forty eight Degrees, twenty Minutes, not much differing from the Latitude of <HI>Paris.</HI> The old Seat of the Dukes of <HI>Austria,</HI> and for a long time of the Emperours of <HI>Germany.</HI> Ac∣cording to ancient account it standeth in <HI>Pannonia supe∣rior,</HI> the Bounds of <HI>Pannonia</HI> extending unto <HI>Kalemburg,</HI> or <HI>Mons Cetius,</HI> five or six miles Westward of <HI>Vienna;</HI> beyond which still Westward all that lieth between that Hill and the great River <HI>Oenus,</HI> or <HI>Inne,</HI> which runneth into the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Passaw,</HI> or <HI>Castra Batava,</HI> was anci∣ently called <HI>Noricum.</HI></P>
<P>It was an ancient place of Habitation in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and called <HI>Vindobona,</HI> as the Learned <HI>Petrus Lambecius</HI> hath at large declared, where the <HI>Classis Istrica</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="40"/> sometimes lay, and the tenth <HI>German Legion</HI> had its sta∣tion; all this shoar or side of the <HI>Danube</HI> being famous for the actions of <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours against the <HI>Marco∣manni</HI> and <HI>Quadi,</HI> who possessed the Country on the o∣ther side of the River, and especially for the wars of <HI>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Philosophus,</HI> who notably de∣feated those Nations, and who, as <HI>Aurelius Victor</HI> (who was Governour of <HI>Sirmium</HI> in <HI>Pannonia inferior,</HI> in the time of <HI>Constantius</HI>) affirmeth, fell sick at <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> now <HI>Petronel,</HI> and died at <HI>Vindobona,</HI> now <HI>Vienna.</HI> And to confirm the Antiquity hereof, besides what <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius</HI> hath delivered, not many years since some Anti∣quities were found. For in the year 1662. when a wall was digged up near the old Palace, the workmen digging still on below the Foundation, found a Stone Trough or Coffin, containing hard Earth and Bones, with a small Gold Coyn, a Glass Urn enclosed in a Brass one, an Iron Knife like a <HI>Sicespita,</HI> or Knife used about Sacrifices, a little Roll or Scroll of pure Gold, shut up with a Gol∣den cover at both ends, wherein was an Inscription in strange Characters: Not far from the Sepulchral Monu∣ment were found a Head in Brass, a Brazen <HI>Patera,</HI> Lamps, Lachrymatories, and other Vessels, and a Copper Coyn of <HI>Antoninus Caracalla.</HI> The writing in the Golden Scroll, which no man could read, was conceived by the Learned <HI>Lambecius</HI> to be the old <HI>Pannonian</HI> Character, and that this might be the Monument of some <HI>Pannonian</HI> Priest in the days of <HI>Caracalla,</HI> who, as good Authors deliver, spent some time about these parts.</P>
<P>It is seated on the South-side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> on the <HI>ripa Romana,</HI> that side nearest to <HI>Rome,</HI> and many <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies, according to the usual position of <HI>Roman</HI> Sta∣tions, both upon this River and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as may be ex∣emplified in <HI>Colen, Bonna, Andarnach, Coblentz, Ments,
<PB N="73" REF="40"/> Wormes, Spier,</HI> and <HI>Strasburg.</HI> And in like manner in the old <HI>Roman</HI> Stations, on the South or <HI>Roman</HI> side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> which were in no small number in or near the <HI>Austrian</HI> shoar, as <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> or <HI>Petronel, Vischmund,</HI> or <HI>Aquinoctium, Ebersdorff,</HI> or <HI>Ala Nova, Melck,</HI> or <HI>No∣male, Arlape,</HI> or <HI>Pechlarne, Lentia,</HI> or <HI>Lintz;</HI> for here∣by they better secured their Conquests, and hindred the incursions of the Barbarians before them.</P>
<P>It is not seated upon the main stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> but by a branch thereof; for the River running through a low Country; it is divided into several Streams, and maketh many Islands. A small River named <HI>Wien,</HI> run∣neth by the East part of this City, and entreth the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> below it, which upon floods doth often much hurt, yet sometimes low and very shallow, so as I have stepped over it; some will have it to give the Name unto this Ci∣ty: it divideth part of the Suburbs from it, and hath divers Bridges over it. For that we may have a distinct apprehension of <HI>Vienna,</HI> we must consider the City and Suburbs thereof; the Suburbs are very great, and not without fair Houses, Gardens, Walks, and all Accommo∣dations at large.</P>
<P>The City it self is that walled and fortified part, de∣signed not only for convenience of Habitation, but also to sustain a Siege, or any Attack from the <HI>Turk,</HI> and is now separated from the Suburbs by a fair <HI>Esplanade,</HI> or open Ground, above a Musket shot over. The Houses near the wall were pulled down since the last Fortificati∣on in the <HI>Turkish</HI> war, when they were in some fear that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Forces about <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>New-heusel,</HI> would move towards them. It is fortified <HI>a la moderna,</HI> with ten Bastions towards the Land, and a very deep Ditch, into which they can let the <HI>Danube:</HI> and with two other Bastions towards the water, on that part of the River
<PB N="74" REF="41"/> which lieth on the North-side of the Town. The Bastions are large; upon one of them I saw Count <HI>Souches</HI> muster a good part of the Militia of the City. The Ditch is large and very deep, into which although they can let in the River, yet it is commonly kept dry, lest they might incommode their deep Cellars. There are two walls, the one old and inward, little considerable at present, built at first with the ransome of our King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, who in his return from the Holy War, was detained Prisoner by the Duke of <HI>Austria</HI> upon the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI> 1192. The <HI>Austrians</HI> pretending they had received some affront from the King at <HI>Joppa,</HI> and that he had taken down the Ensign and Banner of Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> in a con∣temptuous way. The other outward of a great breadth, made of Earth, and faced with Brick, edged with Free∣stone, so well built, as to render this City one of the most considerable fortified places in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Espla∣nade</HI> gently descendeth from the Town for three hundred Paces; there are very few Out-works.</P>
<P>It is very uncertain who was the first Builder of <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> and after it had been long built, it ran to decay a∣gain for Four hundred years together, till <HI>Henry</HI> the First, Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> in the year 1158. did much re∣pair it; and the ransome afterwards of King <HI>Richard</HI> beautified it.</P>
<P>The whole compass, taking in the Suburbs, makes a very large Circuit, but the City it self, which is walled in, may be about three miles in Circumference, and is exceeding populous, as full of People, for the bigness of the place, as most of the great Cities. And I could not but take delight to behold so many Nations in it, as <HI>Turks, Tartars, Graecians, Transylvanians, Sclavonians, Hunga∣rians, Croatians, Spaniards, Italians, French, Germans, Polanders, &amp;c.</HI> all in their proper Habits.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>
<P>The chief Gates are six: 1. <HI>Stubnthor,</HI> or the <HI>Stuben Gate</HI> towards the East. 2. <HI>Karnterthor,</HI> or the <HI>Gate of Carinthia</HI> towards the South. 3. <HI>Burgthor,</HI> the <HI>Town Gate,</HI> or <HI>Castle Gate. 4. Schottenthor,</HI> or the <HI>Scotch Gate. 5. Newthor,</HI> or the <HI>Newgate;</HI> these two last to∣wards the West: And 6. the <HI>Gate of the red Tower</HI> to∣wards the North, which leadeth unto the Bridge over the <HI>Danube:</HI> and towards the water side, there is also a Port by the Emperours palace, and a Cloyster or Nunnery in the Town hath the Name of a Port called <HI>Himmel port,</HI> or the <HI>Gate of Heaven.</HI> The five first of these Gates are vaulted and arched with long passages through the Town∣wall, and have good Bridges of Wood, with Draw∣bridges to pass over the Town ditch: The sixth is un∣der a Tower, and leads to the Bridges of the <HI>Danube:</HI> For that River running here in a flat low Country, divi∣deth its streams, so that to pass it quite over, there are at present seven long Bridges made up of many thousand Tree laid one by another, after their way of making Bridges. There is also a Bridge within the City of <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> called the <HI>Hochbrug,</HI> or <HI>High-bridge,</HI> which is made by the crossing of two Streets at equal Angles; the ground of one street being as high as the tops of the Hou∣ses of the other, so that to continue it, they were for∣ced to build a Bridge or Arch in the <HI>Lower-street,</HI> to let the upper pass over it.</P>
<P>The City is fairly built of stone, and well paved; ma∣ny Houses are of six stories high; they are somewhat flat roofed after the <HI>Italian</HI> way; the Streets are not narrow, but the compass of ground will not admit them to be very broad; and their Buildings are remarkable both above and below ground; their Cellars are very deep. To sa∣tisfie my curiosity, I went into some of them, and found four Cellars one under another; they were arched, and
<PB N="76" REF="42"/> had two pair of Stairs to descend into them. Some have an open space in the middle of each roof, to let the Air out of one Cellar into another, and from the lowest an <HI>adit</HI> or <HI>tube</HI> unto the top, to let the Air in and out from the street, somewhat after the manner of the Mines.</P>
<P><HI>Aenaeas Sylvius,</HI> about two hundred years since, com∣mending the City of <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> among other expressions lets fall this: <HI>Cuperent Scotorum Reges tam egregiè quam mediocres Cives</HI> Norinbergenses <HI>habitare.</HI> The Kings of <HI>Scots</HI> would be content to dwell so well as the middle sort of Citizens of <HI>Nurnburg.</HI> I must confess, when I first entred <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> I was much surprised to see such a noble, large, spruce, rich, and well built City: But <HI>Vi∣enna</HI> doth also deserve the commendation which he af∣fordeth it: <HI>Ubi Palatia digna Regibus &amp; Templa quae mi∣rari</HI> Italia <HI>possit.</HI> Where there are Palaces fit for Kings and Churches, which <HI>Italy</HI> may admire. And this being spo∣ken so long ago, is now better verified of it.</P>
<P>The Imperial Palace is very Noble, Substantial, and Princely furnished, consisting chiefly of two Courts; the one very large, the other lesser, wherein the Emperour lodgeth. At the Entrance over the Gate, are set in Ca∣pital Letters the five Vowels, <HI>A, E, I, O, U;</HI> whereof the Phancies of men make various Interpretations. That which was told me was this, <HI>Austriae est imperare Orbi Universo;</HI> or, <HI>Alles Erdreich Ist Osterreich Unterthan, i. e.</HI> All the World is subject to <HI>Austria.</HI> Although I could hardly believe this was the first intended meaning. Be∣sides these two Courts is another small one, where some of the Pages lodge. I took notice of a large rough <HI>Jaspis</HI> stone lying upon the ground, little regarded or observed: it is about nine foot Diameter; it was presented unto the Emperour by the Archbishop of <HI>Saltzburg,</HI> whose Coun∣try affordeth notable Quarries, and stones of many sorts;

<P>There are also many fair Churches, rich Convents, and Conventual Churches; as that of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> of the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> of the <HI>Benedictines,</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> In this Church I could not but take notice of the late Sepul∣chral Monuments of Count <HI>Strozzi</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Ha∣rach.</HI> The <HI>Dominican</HI> Convent is very fair. The <HI>Au∣gustines</HI> have a large Church, in the middle whereof they have built a Chappel after the manner of the Holy House at <HI>Loretto;</HI> upon the top of which hang the Colours ta∣ken from the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> many of which Ensigns are not square like ours, but made Escucheon-wise, some fil∣led with Circles, wherein are expressed half Moons. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> Colledges are large, who seldome fail of noble Convents, especially in places where they have so good footing as in this. The Front of one of their Colledges openeth into a fair <HI>Piazza,</HI> in the middle whereof stands a large and high composite Column of Copper upon a Pe∣destal of white stone, with four Angels with Escucheons, and on the top the blessed Virgin; Inscriptions also, in which the Emperour dedicates <HI>Austria</HI> unto her Patro∣nage and Tuition. In another Market-place, where the Town-house is, there is a handsome <HI>Statua</HI> of Justice in Copper.</P>
<P>I could not but observe the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church and Cloy∣ster, which gave also the name unto the <HI>Scotch</HI> Gate of the City, because I somewhat wondered how the <HI>Scots</HI> in old time should be so considerable in this place, but I found by Information, and the Account of <HI>Lazius</HI> and <HI>Matthaeus Merian</HI> in <HI>High-dutch,</HI> that this Convent was in
<PB N="78" REF="44"/> former times a great Receptacle for the <HI>Scots</HI> in their long Pilgrimage unto <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> founded and endowed by Duke <HI>Henry</HI> the First, in memory of St. <HI>Gregory:</HI> and it may seem less strange that the <HI>Scots</HI> should have a Convent here, and be numerous in these parts in former Ages, if we consider that St. <HI>Colman,</HI> one of the Saints of the greatest Veneration in this Country was a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> and said to be of the Royal Blood of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who, in his passage to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was murdered by the <HI>Baurs</HI> or Coun∣try people at <HI>Stockerau,</HI> four <HI>German</HI> miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and hanged on a Tree, where, as the Story goes, his Body remained uncorrupted for a year and a half, and divers Miracles being affirmed of it, it was taken down, and honourably interred near <HI>Stockerau;</HI> but by <HI>Meginhard</HI> Bishop of <HI>Aichstadt</HI> it was translated unto <HI>Melk,</HI> and af∣terwards sent into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and his Head kept a long time at <HI>Stullweissenburg,</HI> or <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> according to the Account which is here given of this Saint.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is also considerable, not for its Splendour but Antiquity, as being accounted the ol∣dest in the City, standing in a place where in old time there stood an Altar in honour of <HI>Domitian,</HI> called <HI>Ara Flaviana.</HI> In this Church lieth the Body of that famous and learned Person <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius,</HI> with this Epitaph or Inscription:</P>
<P><HI>Magnifico Nobili Clarissimo atque summâ eruditione or∣natissimo viro Domino</HI> Wolfgango Latzio Vien. <HI>Philoso∣phiae atque Medicinae Doctori &amp; Professori Primario, Ce∣leberrimi Archigymnasii</HI> Viennensis <HI>Rectori &amp; Superinten∣denti</HI> Caesareo, <HI>&amp; ejusdem Sacrae</HI> Caesareae <HI>Majest.</HI> Fer∣dinandi <HI>Sanctissimae memoriae Consiliario &amp; Historico Pe∣ritissimo, defuncto Anno Domini</HI> MDLXXXVI.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
<P>In the Church of the <HI>Capucines</HI> Convent, are interred the Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> and his Empress, and the Em∣press <HI>Maria,</HI> wife to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third, who out of their Devotion and Humility, chose to be buried in a Church of this poor Order. And the <HI>Capucines</HI> not ad∣mitting of Magnificent Monuments in their Churches, as in the Churches of other Orders, no Tombs are erected worthy so great an Emperour, and such Empresses.</P>
<P>But the Cathedral Church of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> containeth divers Monuments of many Princes and Great Persons, and is a large stately Building, but somewhat dark by reason of the thick painted Glass: not covered with Lead, but with Tiles of wood, which is the only blemish thereof, yet makes a good show. The Steeple and Spire are very remarkable, as being high, large, strong, and handsome. On the top or Weathercock-place of the Spire stands a Cross under a Star and half Moon, according to the Figure I have elsewhere set down, which the People think to be of Gold, or at least very well gilded: and in the time of Thunder and Lightning it looked pale and whitish.</P>
<P>They have this Account how these came first to be set up in this place: That when <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent be∣sieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> perceiving the Forces in the City to be obstinate, he had an intent to batter down the Steeple a∣bout their ears: But some of the <HI>Bassa's</HI> and great Com∣manders, advertising him how unprofitable a business it would prove, and withal when he took the City, what an honour it would be unto him to have such a Noble Py∣ramid in his Dominions: He sent word into the Town, That he was willing to spare the Steeple, upon condition that they would set up the half Moon and Star (the <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Arms) upon the top thereof. They returned An∣swer that they would, if he would send the same
<PB N="80" REF="45"/> unto them, which he did, and they placed it where it standeth.</P>
<P>This Spire hath the largest Crockets I have observed in any, they being above a yard long, and adorned with foliage work. The Spire of <HI>Landshute</HI> in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> is accounted the highest in <HI>Germany;</HI> that of <HI>Strasburg</HI> the neatest and fairest; and this of <HI>Vienna</HI> the largest and strongest. And therefore it is no wonder that when the Ambassadours of <HI>Bosna</HI> formerly came unto <HI>Vienna,</HI> they so often viewed and admired this Fabrick, and plainly said that all the mony in their Country was not sufficient to have built it.</P>
<P>This Steeple is accounted about four hundred sixty and five foot high, being about half way up three hundred and thirty eight steps. Besides other Hills, I could see <HI>Haimburger</HI> Hill within two miles of <HI>Presburg,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Austria,</HI> which the long Course of the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> rendred very pleasant and delightful unto the eye. In the Chamber or Room from whence I had this prospect, there is a Clock, whose Case being of wood, was in part burnt down by Lightning, and therefore there is water always kept in this place to extinguish the fire, and a man continually watcheth in the place where the Bells hand. There is also an Instrument of wood, or wooden Bells or Hammers, which they make use of from <HI>Good∣friday</HI> till <HI>Easter-sunday,</HI> all the time that our Saviour was in the Grave, during which time they permit no Bells to ring.</P>
<P>At one of the doors of the Church there is a stone pla∣ced in the wall, which is generally conceived to be one of the stones wherewith St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was stoned. It seem∣ed to me some kind of pebble, and is worn and polished by the hands of the people, who when they enter at that door, do touch it with their fingers. I was also shewed

<P>In this Church of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> besides many Monu∣ments of great Princes and famous Persons, divers learn∣ed men have Sepulchral Inscriptions; as <HI>Johannes Faber Bishop of Vienna; Johannes Cuspinianus,</HI> and <HI>Sebastianus Tengnagelius,</HI> formerly Library-keeper, Historiogra∣pher, and Counsellor to the Emperour, an extraordina∣ry learned man, and skilful in fifteen Languages, as the Inscription delivers; as <HI>Hebrew, Syriack, Chaldee, Persian, Arabick, Turkish, Aethiopick, Greek, Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Belgick,</HI> and <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI></P>
<P>The University of <HI>Vienna</HI> is also remarkable, if we conssider the Antiquity thereof, the number of Scholars, their course of Studies, their accommodations, privi∣ledges and advancements.

<P>These Divisions take up all the Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and indeed there are Students here of many Nations: and upon Contentions and Differences the several <HI>Classes</HI> will hold unto their own, and take parts, and bandy against each other, but will all unite and hold together in differ∣ences with Towns-men or Jews, which happen sometimes unto an high degree.</P>
<P>They follow here the old beaten way of Knowledge: and I met with few who had any good insight in new <HI>Phi∣losophy;</HI> but there are many good <HI>Philologers,</HI> and are well versed in Languages, History and Antiquity: and there are many Learned Men either educated here, or come from other parts. Some who had taken notice of the <HI>Royal Socie∣ty</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> were very inquisitive after it; and when I had satisfied them in all particulars, were very much pleased therewith. If they should fall into the way of <HI>Experimental Philosophy,</HI> being very industrious, 'tis ve∣ry probable they may do much therein, and they were sure to have the countenance of the Emperour. I found them also much affected with the <HI>English</HI> Society in other parts of <HI>Germany.</HI> At the University of <HI>Altorff</HI> I was much enquired of concerning it: and a Magistrate of <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> who had got a <HI>Telescope</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> invited
<PB N="83" REF="47"/> me to his House, to practise the way of using it. <HI>Der Herr von Adlershelme</HI> of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> a Person of great Cu∣riosity, was very inquisitive after the same <HI>Society.</HI> And of late years the <HI>Curiosi</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> have held Learned Con∣ventions and Correspondence, and printed their <HI>Obser∣vations</HI> at <HI>Leipsick.</HI> And since my Return into <HI>England,</HI> I have been solicited from <HI>Cassovia</HI> in <HI>Upper Hungary,</HI> to send the <HI>Transactions</HI> into those Parts.</P>
<P>During my stay at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I went unto a publick Ana∣to my of a Woman that was beheaded: the <HI>Lecture</HI> lasted so long, that the Body was Nineteen days unburied. It was performed by a Learned Physician, Dr. <HI>Wolfstregel,</HI> who read in <HI>Latin</HI> to the satisfaction of all persons. What I most particularly observed therein was this, The <HI>Pyra∣midal Muscles</HI> very plain and large; the <HI>Uterus</HI> larger than is usually observed; the <HI>Cartilago Ensiformis</HI> double; the <HI>Lungs</HI> very black; the <HI>Eye</HI> was very well shown; he produced an artificial Eye of Ivory, and another large one of Pastboard and Paper, contrived and made by him∣self; the <HI>Muscles</HI> of the <HI>Pharynx, Larynx, Os Hyoides,</HI> and the <HI>Tongue,</HI> after their dissection, he reduced very handsomely into their proper places again, to shew their natural situation and position. The <HI>Anatomy-Theatre</HI> was of capacity to receive above an hundred persons; and according to the custome of other places, to avoid imper∣tinent Spectators, a piece of Mony was given for admis∣sion. Of <HI>Anatomy-Theatres,</HI> until of late, there have been few in <HI>Germany,</HI> or none. And when I was in the <HI>Anato∣my-School</HI> at <HI>Altorff,</HI> near <HI>Nurenburg,</HI> that learned and ci∣vil Professor, Dr. <HI>Mauritius Hoffmannus,</HI> told me that the same was the First in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paulus de Sorbait,</HI> Prime Professor, Physician unto <HI>E∣leonora</HI> the Empress Dowager, and Knight of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was the <HI>Rector Magnificus. Zwelfer,</HI> who writ <HI>Animad∣versions
<PB N="84" REF="48"/> upon the Dispensatory of Ausburg,</HI> was in great re∣pute in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and had built for himself a noble House in the City, but he died some time before my coming thi∣ther.</P>
<P>In fine, the University is noble, their Advancements considerable, their Priviledges great, and they have the power of life and death, from ancient and latter Conces∣sions of their Dukes and Emperours.</P>
<P>But the greatest lustre unto <HI>Vienna</HI> is the Residence of the present Emperour <HI>Leopoldus;</HI> he was born in the year 1638. he was Son unto the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third; he was baptized by the Names of <HI>Leopoldus, Ig∣natius, Franciscus, Balthazar, Josephus, Felicianus.</HI> His eldest Brother <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> died of the Small Pox in his Fathers time. His Brother <HI>Carolus Josephus,</HI> Master of the <HI>Teutonick Order,</HI> dyed 1662. He married <HI>Margareta</HI> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> daughter unto King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, whose Children died Infants; a ver∣tuous, affable, grave, and worthy Prince, and seemed to me to live very happily here, in the love and honour of his People, Souldiers, and Clergy.</P>
<P>His Person is grave and graceful; he hath the <HI>Austrian</HI> Lip remarkably, his Chin long, which is taken for a good Physiognomical mark, and a sign of a constant, placid, and little troubled mind. He is conceived to carry in his Face the lineaments of four of his Predecessours, that is, of <HI>Rudolphus</HI> the First, of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the First, of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the First. He was very affecti∣onate unto his Empress, who, though but young, was a modest, grave Princess, had a good aspect, was zealous in her Religion, and an Enemy unto the Jews. He shewed also great respect and observance unto the Empress Dow∣ager <HI>Eleonora,</HI> who was a sober and prudent Princess, well skilled in all kind of curious Works, and delighted
<PB N="85" REF="48"/> sometimes to shoot at Deer from a Stand, or at other Game, out of her Coach. He was also very loving unto his Sisters, beautiful and good Ladies; whereof one, the eldest, was since married unto that Noble Prince <HI>Michael Wisnowitzski,</HI> King of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>He speaks four Languages, <HI>German, Italian, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> He is a great countenancer of Learned Men, and delighteth to read, and when occasion permitteth, will pass some hours at it. The worthy <HI>Petrus Lambe∣cius</HI> his Library Keeper, and who is in great esteem with him, will usually find out some Books for him which he conceiveth may be acceptable. While I was there he re∣commended a Translation of <HI>Religio Medici</HI> unto him, wherewith the Emperour was exceedingly pleased, and spake very much of it unto <HI>Lambecius,</HI> insomuch that <HI>Lambecius</HI> asked me whether I knew the Author, he be∣ing of my own name, and whether he were living: And when he understood my near Relation to him, he became more kind and courteous than ever, and desired me to send him that Book in the Original <HI>English,</HI> which he would put into the Emperours Library: and presented me with a neat little <HI>Latin</HI> Book, called <HI>Princeps in Com∣pendio,</HI> written by the Emperours Father, <HI>Ferdinandus</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>He is also skilful in Musick, composeth well, and de∣lighted much in it, both at his Palace and the Church, which makes so many Musicians in <HI>Vienna;</HI> for no place abounds more with them; and in the Evening we seldom failed of Musick in the Streets, and at our Windows: And the Emperours delight herein makes the Church-men take the greater care to set off their Church-musick, for he goeth often to Church, and not to one, but divers, e∣specially the best Conventual Churches: and in his own Chappel some of his own Compositions are often play'd.
<PB N="86" REF="49"/> He hath also excellent Musick in his Palace, both Vocal and Instrumental; and his private Chappel is well ser∣ved, where besides the excellent Musick, there are al∣ways eight or ten Counts, Pages to the Emperour, who serve at the Altar with white wax Torches in their hands; and after the manner of the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, divers <HI>Eunuchs</HI> to sing.</P>
<P>For his Recreations abroad, he delighteth much in Hunting, especially of the wild Boar in due seasons; I have known him bring home six Boars in a morning. Some stout persons, particularly Count <HI>Nicholas Serini,</HI> would encounter a wild Boar alone, but at last he unfortunately perished by one, which hath made others more wary since; and therefore when the Boar is at a Bay, the Hunts∣men so stand about him, that the Emperour, or other great persons, may more safely make use of their Boar∣spears upon him.</P>
<P>Surely there are great numbers of them about the Country, for they are no unusual or extraordinary Dish in the City, though of a delicious and pleasing taste. They feed upon <HI>Acorns, Beech-mast,</HI> and <HI>Chesnuts,</HI> upon the spring or sprout of <HI>Broom, Juniper,</HI> and <HI>Shrubs,</HI> and up∣on the roots of <HI>Fern,</HI> and will range into Corn-fields, and come out of Forrests into Vineyards. The Hunts∣men are notably versed and skilful in that Game; for though they see it not, they will distinguish a wild from a common Swine, and ghess whether that which they hunt be Male or Female, old or young, large or small, fat or lean; and this they chiefly conjecture from their tread or foot, and the casting their hindfeet out of the track of their forefeet.</P>
<P>The Emperour being so good a Huntsman, it is the less wonder that he is esteemed a good Horsman. Certain it is, that he hath a very noble Stable of Horses, procured
<PB N="87" REF="49"/> from all parts, <HI>Turkish, Tartarian, Polonian, Transylvanian, Saxon, Bohemian, Hungarian, Naples, &amp;c.</HI> and they are well managed; and they ride them to the satisfaction of the Beholders.</P>
<P>Having seen the <HI>Arsenal</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> the <HI>Stores</HI> at <HI>Chat∣ham,</HI> and the <HI>Naval Provisions</HI> at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I am not like to admire any other, especially so far from the Sea, and looked for nothing of that nature in this place. Not∣withstanding I found an <HI>Arsenal,</HI> and place for Naval Vessels to be set out upon occasion, and some thereof were employed in the last <HI>Turkish</HI> war, when they at∣tempted to destroy the Bridge of Boats which the <HI>Turks</HI> had made over the <HI>Danube,</HI> a little above <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>Bare∣han.</HI> They are built somewhat like <HI>Galleys,</HI> carry great Guns, and a good number of Souldiers, and will make a sight upon the broad deep stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and may be handsomely brought into the Town behind one of the Bastions, when the River is high; and hereof there are some at <HI>Rab</HI> and <HI>Komora,</HI> as I have declared elsewhere.</P>
<P>The Emperour hath many Counsellors, great Souldiers and Courtiers about him; among which these seemed of greatest Note.</P>
<P><HI>Eusebius Wenceslaus</HI> Duke <HI>de Sagan,</HI> Prince <HI>Lobko∣witz,</HI> Pirme Counsellor, <HI>Hoff-meister,</HI> of the Or∣der of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> a person of a grave and sober Aspect, somewhat blunt in conversation, but of a gener∣ous temper, and free from all covetousness, who spent his Revenues nobly, and unto his great reputation: He was chief Favorite unto the Emperour; and though some had no great opinion of his Abilities, yet he was the first that discovered the last <HI>Hungarian</HI> defection and revolt, whereby those Noble Persons, Count <HI>Peter Serini</HI> and <HI>Nadasti</HI> (whom I saw at <HI>Vienna</HI>) were brought unto their ends.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="50"/>
<P><HI>Henricus Gulielmus,</HI> Count of <HI>Stahrenberg, Ober-hoff-Mareschal,</HI> or <HI>Lord Marshal of the Court.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Johannes Maximilianus,</HI> Count of <HI>Lamburg, Oberst-Kammer-Herr,</HI> or <HI>Chief of the Chamber,</HI> a Person of great esteem. The Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber are numerous, and many are in extraordinary; there may be an hundred of them, all <HI>Barons</HI> and <HI>Counts.</HI> Every one of them wears a Golden Key before his Breast: and the Grooms of the Bed-chamber wear one of Steel: Two of each attend every Night.</P>
<P><HI>Gundakerus,</HI> Count <HI>Dietrichstein, Oberst-Stall-Meister,</HI> or <HI>Chief Master of the Horse.</HI></P>
<P>These are the Chief. These following are also consi∣derable.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Sinzendorff, Oberste-Jag-Meister, Grand Ve∣neur,</HI> or <HI>Hunts-Master,</HI> a Person in good favour with the Emperour, who very much delighteth in Hunting, as have most of his Predecessors.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Aversberg Oberst Falken-Meister, Chief Falconer,</HI> who hath twelve Falconers under him.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Paar, Chief Master of the Emperours Post.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leopoldus Wilhelmus,</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Baden, Captain</HI> of an hundred <HI>Hartshires,</HI> who are the <HI>Horse-guard,</HI> and ride with <HI>Pistols</HI> and <HI>Carabines</HI> out of the City; but within <HI>Vienna</HI> they cary <HI>Launces</HI> and <HI>Javelins</HI> with broad points.</P>
<P><HI>Franciscus Augustinus,</HI> Count of <HI>Wallensteyn, Captain</HI> of an hundred of the <HI>Foot-guard,</HI> of a good Personage, and well esteemed of by the Emperour.</P>
<P>Sixty, or more, <HI>Pages,</HI> for the number is uncertain, and not limited; most of them <HI>Counts</HI> and <HI>Barons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Raymundus,</HI> Count <HI>de Montecuculi,</HI> was his <HI>General,</HI> President of the Council of War, Governour of <HI>Rab</HI> and
<PB N="89" REF="50"/> the Confines about it, and of the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Golden Fleece;</HI> a tall Person, somewhat lean, but hath a spirit in his look: he is one of the oldest Commanders in <HI>Europe,</HI> and performed good Service in <HI>Poland, Hungary, Ger∣many</HI> in many places, and is esteemed a prudent, valiant, and successful Commander.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Souches</HI> was also a <HI>Commander</HI> of great Fame, and in high esteem with the Emperour. He was a Native of <HI>Rochelle:</HI> he first served the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> wars, and was a Colonel, but upon some disgust he forsook the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and served the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> and was made Governour of <HI>Brin,</HI> the second Town in <HI>Mo∣ravia.</HI> After the taking of <HI>Crembs</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> General <HI>Torstenson</HI> besieged <HI>Brin,</HI> and sent word unto the Govern∣our <HI>de Souches,</HI> That if he refused to deliver up the Town he would give him no quarter. Who answered him, That he would not ask any, and also give none: and defended the place with such resolution, that after many Assaults, Underminings, and Attempts by <HI>Granado's, Torstenson</HI> was forced to rise, after a Siege of four months, which was so advantagious unto <HI>Austria</HI> and the <HI>Imperial</HI> affairs, that the Emperour took especial notice of him, made him a <HI>Baron,</HI> and of his <HI>Privy Council.</HI> He commanded also all the Forces in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and did notable Service in the last <HI>Turkish</HI> wars. He took the City of <HI>Nitra,</HI> or <HI>Nitria,</HI> not far from <HI>Strigonium</HI> or <HI>Gran;</HI> and took and slew six thousand <HI>Turks</HI> which were sent by the <HI>Vizier</HI> of <HI>Buda</HI> a∣gainst him: a worthy Person, and of a good Aspect. Count <HI>Souches</HI> the younger his Son, an Heroick Com∣mander, is Governour of the strong fortified place <HI>Leopold∣stadt</HI> by <HI>Freistadt,</HI> a Person of great Civility, unto whom I was much obliged.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Lesly,</HI> Nephew unto Count <HI>Lesly</HI> who was sent Ambassadour to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to the <HI>Sultan</HI> from the Em∣perour,
<PB N="90" REF="51"/> is a Commander worthy of that esteem he hath with the Emperour; a Person of great Courage, Civility and Humanity, which I must ever acknowledge.</P>
<P>The Courts of the Empress, and of the Empress Dow∣ager, are filled with Persons of Note; and there are a great number of Souldiers in this place of great Fame, as the Marquiss <HI>Pio, Spork, Cops,</HI> and many more. Many of the Clergy and Men of Learning, are in good esteem with the Emperour; but the <HI>Jesuites Milner</HI> and <HI>Bocca∣bella</HI> are his near Favorites. Many Strangers, both Soul∣diers and Scholars, have built their Fortunes here. And surely Strangers of parts and industry, so they be of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> are not like to raise their Fortunes any where better than in these parts.</P>
<P>Though the Emperour goeth not to war in Person, yet hath he been successful in his wars, especially in the last Battel with the <HI>Turks</HI> at St. <HI>Godart,</HI> where the business was handsomly and actively managed, to set upon the body of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which had passed the River <HI>Rab,</HI> before the whole Forces of the <HI>Vizier</HI> could come over, to the great slaughter of the <HI>Janisaries</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who fought stout∣ly, and were first put to a Retreat by the <HI>French</HI> Caval∣ry. For at first the <HI>Turks</HI> seemed to prevail, and had slain a great part of two Regiments of the <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> which came out of <HI>Franconia,</HI> and after their custome, had cut off their Heads.</P>
<P>Among the many notable things in <HI>Vienna,</HI> the <HI>Imperi∣al</HI> Library is very remarkable. He who hath seen the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the <HI>Vatican</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> would be much surprised to find such a notable one here, as may compare with them; especially upon the extreme Borders of the Learned part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The number and nobleness of the Books doth much ex∣ceed the receptacle or place which containeth them, as
<PB N="91" REF="51"/> making no fair shew at the entrance, and somewhat want∣ing light. But as for the number and value of the Books, they are of opinion here that it yieldeth unto none, but rather excelleth any other Library in <HI>Europe.</HI> There was a place designed for the building of a fit receptacle for them; but, I know not how, a Theatre for Comedies is now built in that place.</P>
<P>It is divided into eight Chambers or Rooms, which are so well filled, that many Books are fain to lye upon the Floor; and the Shelves stand so close, that there is but just room to pass between them. The Manuscripts stand distinct from the printed Books, according to their Languages, being divided into six <HI>Classes, Theological, Juridical, Medical, Philosophical, Historical, Philologi∣cal.</HI> There can scarce be a more admirable Collection than the Manuscripts in part of the first Chamber, of <HI>He∣brew, Syriack, Arabick, Turkish, Armenian, Aethiopick,</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> Books.</P>
<P>It was begun, at least the Books began to be placed in this receptacle, by <HI>Maximilian</HI> the First, but hath been much encreased by succeeding Emperours, most of them, since <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the First, being much addicted unto Learning, there having been large accessions from many noble Libraries, and most upon the cost of the Emper∣ours. The choicest Books in the famous Library of <HI>Bu∣da,</HI> of King <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> Son unto <HI>Huniades,</HI> are now in it. The notable Library of <HI>Wolfgangus La∣zius,</HI> who was Library-Keeper, was brought hither, and Three thousand Books of <HI>Johannes Sambucus</HI> are now in this Repository.</P>
<P><HI>Augerius Busbequius,</HI> sometime Library-Keeper hereof, added much unto it; and in his two <HI>Turkish</HI> Embassies procured great number of noble <HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which are inscribed with his own hand,
<PB N="92" REF="52"/> <HI>Aug. de Busbeck. emit Constantinopoli.</HI> A great many were added from the Library of the Learned <HI>Johannes Cuspini∣anus,</HI> Library Keeper, and Counsellor unto the Emper∣our. The notable Libraries and Mathematical Instru∣ments of <HI>Tycho Brahe, Kepler,</HI> and <HI>Gassendus,</HI> were pur∣chased for it. But the largest accession was made by the noble Library of Count <HI>Fugger,</HI> which consisting of six∣teen thousand Volumes, was purchased by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third. Many were brought, some few years past, from the <HI>Ambrasian</HI> Library by <HI>Inspruck,</HI> by the Learned <HI>Pe∣trus Lambecius,</HI> Library Keeper, Historiographer, and Counsellor unto the present Emperour; who hath also an excellent Library which is like to be added unto the <HI>Imperial.</HI> He then reckoned the Volumes in this great Library to amount at least to Fourscore thousand; and by this time that number may be increased, for he ad∣deth some yearly. And the number might almost be endless, if they would make use of their priviledge, for the Emperour hath a right to have two Books of all that are printed in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>They have also a great advantage at <HI>Vienna,</HI> to acquire good <HI>Manuscripts</HI> from the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, for the Emperour is obliged to have a Resident with the Grand <HI>Signor</HI> wheresoever he moveth or ordereth him to be; even at the last sight of St. <HI>Godart,</HI> the Emperour's Resident was in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp. And when I was at <HI>Larissa</HI> in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> the Resident <HI>Signor di Casa Nova,</HI> was inquisi∣tive after Books to be found among the <HI>Greeks</HI> in Mona∣steries and other places. And this Emperour, like his Father, will spare no cost toward such Acquiries.</P>
<P>By the especial favour of my noble Friend <HI>Lambecius,</HI> I went many times into this Library, and he was so cour∣teous as to let me have what Books I desired unto my pri∣vate Lodging: He would shew me divers Books upon
<PB N="93" REF="52"/> what Subject I required, and offered me a sight of what Books he thought rare and estimable; and amongst others I could not but take notice of these following.</P>
<P>A <HI>Letter</HI> of the present Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> in the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Tartarian</HI> Languages, unto the present Em∣perour of <HI>Germany,</HI> weaved in a very fine <HI>Roll.</HI></P>
<P>Another old <HI>Roll</HI> written in unknown Letters, yet a little resembling the <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Book</HI> in the <HI>Runick</HI> Language.</P>
<P>A very fair <HI>Manuscript</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> with the Mapps drawn in Colours.</P>
<P>The <HI>oldest Manuscript</HI> and <HI>true Exemplar</HI> of <HI>Livie,</HI> in large Letters, without distinction of <HI>Words</HI> or <HI>Sentences,</HI> very uneasie to be read, a thousand years old, and brought, not many years since, from the Library near <HI>Inspruck.</HI></P>
<P>An old fair <HI>Greek Manuscript</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> written eleven hundred years since, in very large <HI>Letters,</HI> without distance of <HI>Words,</HI> or <HI>Accents,</HI> wherein all the <HI>Plants</HI> are lively painted; also the <HI>Pictures</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides, Galen, Pamphilus, Cratevas,</HI> and other ancient <HI>Physicians,</HI> bought of a <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Constantinople</HI> for an hundred <HI>Ducats</HI> by <HI>Bus∣bequius.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Geometrical Propositions</HI> demonstrated in the <HI>China</HI> Language.</P>
<P>Another fair one in the <HI>China</HI> Tongue with <HI>Pi∣ctures.</HI></P>
<P>A noble old <HI>Greek Manuscript</HI> in great uncial <HI>Letters,</HI> without stops, points, or distance of words.</P>
<P>An ancient <HI>Greek Manuscript</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> in large <HI>Letters,</HI> without distance or accents, thirteen hun∣dred years ago; wherein are Forty eight <HI>Pictures</HI> or <HI>Draughts</HI> in <HI>Miniature</HI> or <HI>Water colours,</HI> much conducing to the knowledge of <HI>ancient Habits,</HI> the manner of <HI>Feast∣ing,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="53"/> postures at <HI>Meals,</HI> waiting of <HI>Servants</HI> and <HI>Musical Instruments:</HI> Wherein I could not but take notice of the <HI>Golden Spot</HI> upon <HI>Josephs</HI> breast; and the manner of the <HI>Execution</HI> of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Baker, his <HI>Head</HI> being put through a forked piece of wood, and his <HI>Hands</HI> tyed behind him.</P>
<P>A fair <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> wherein are many fine <HI>Paintings</HI> in <HI>Miniature</HI> or <HI>Limning;</HI> as also a <HI>Sphere,</HI> and within it a <HI>Globe</HI> carved and painted by him.</P>
<P>A fair <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> wherein, besides many rare things in <HI>Architecture,</HI> are all the <HI>paintings</HI> and <HI>de∣signs</HI> of the <HI>Belvedere</HI> in little.</P>
<P>A fair <HI>Alcoran</HI> in <HI>Arabick,</HI> interlined with the <HI>Turkish</HI> to explain it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bible</HI> in the <HI>Coptick</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Languages.</P>
<P><HI>Luther</HI>'s own <HI>Bible,</HI> marked with his own <HI>Hand,</HI> and interlined by him with <HI>Notes</HI> in many places.</P>
<P>A fair <HI>Greek Manuscript</HI> of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> fifteen hundred years ago written in <HI>Letters</HI> of <HI>Gold</HI> upon <HI>Pur∣ple.</HI></P>
<P>There was also a <HI>Magical Glass,</HI> obtained by the Em∣perour <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> whereby to see <HI>Apparitions,</HI> and con∣verse with <HI>Spirits;</HI> which some conceive to be the same, or of the like nature with that used by <HI>Kelly.</HI></P>
<P>Of ancient <HI>Greek, Roman,</HI> and <HI>Gothick Medals</HI> and <HI>Coyns,</HI> in <HI>Gold, Silver,</HI> and <HI>Copper,</HI> to the number of six∣teen thousand. Among the <HI>Copper Coyns</HI> they pretend to have two of the Emperour <HI>Marcus Otho.</HI></P>
<P>I let fall some <HI>Drops</HI> into this <HI>Ocean,</HI> adding some <HI>Coyns, Intaglia's,</HI> and <HI>Inscriptions</HI> not to be found in that large work of <HI>Gruterus;</HI> which having found in the Em∣perours furthest Dominions and <HI>Turkish</HI> parts, long out of his possession, where there had been no great enquiry af∣ter them; were shewed unto his Imperial Majesty by <HI>Pe∣trus
<PB N="95" REF="53"/> Lambecius,</HI> and so well accepted by him, that he said I might have the use of what Books I desired: and at my return into <HI>England</HI> he gave me a formal Pass in <HI>Latin</HI> for my safe Travel, and that my Trunks or Goods might not be searched, which takes off a great deal of trouble in passing so many <HI>Principalities</HI> and free <HI>Cities,</HI> Command∣ing all in his own Dominions, and Requesting all Princes in <HI>Germany</HI> to favour me, and permit me to pass freely without molestation: It was thus Subscribed,</P>

Yet having a fair opportunity, I would not leave <HI>Vienna</HI> without a sight of the most noble <HI>Trea∣sury</HI> or <HI>Repository</HI> of his Imperial Majesty; especially ha∣ving heard so much thereof, and knowing it to be the <HI>Collection</HI> of many succeeding Emperours. I therefore took a fit opportunity to remain divers hours in it, and was extremely delighted with the rich and magnificent Curiosities thereof. To set down all I saw, were a work too large for this Volume; and the Catalogue of them, which is kept in this place, taketh up a large Volume in <HI>Folio.</HI> I shall therefore only mention these following,

The <HI>Head</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the First King of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> in <HI>white Marble.</HI> A <HI>Pedistal</HI> of <HI>Amber,</HI> over which a <HI>Cross.</HI> The <HI>Head</HI> of St. <HI>Valerius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Triers.</HI> The <HI>Picture</HI> of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> of <HI>Sienna,</HI> drawn by <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of <HI>Poland.</HI> A Picture of the <HI>Emperour</HI> as he giveth <HI>Audience,</HI> to be looked upon through a little round hole. A neat <HI>Table</HI> of <HI>Inlay'd Stone</HI> made by the present Empress Dowager <HI>Eleonora.</HI> A <HI>Nail</HI> of our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s <HI>Cross</HI> almost a foot long; our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s <HI>Blood;</HI> and two <HI>Thorns</HI> of his <HI>Crown,</HI> the one whiter than the other. <HI>Priests Garments</HI> covered all over with large <HI>Pearl.</HI> The great and high esteemed <HI>Agate Dish,</HI> between three and four spans Diameter, with XRISOS naturally in it. Unto which one applied that of St. <HI>Luke, Dico vobis quia si hi tacuerint, lapides clamabunt.</HI></P>
<P>Unto which magnificent Rarities there is one more added, the noble <HI>Chain</HI> of <HI>Pearl</HI> of eight yards long, ta∣ken from the <HI>Graff Tokoly</HI> in the late <HI>Hungarian</HI> war, as I understand since my Return.</P>
<P>I went unto divers noted Places about <HI>Vienna:</HI> I walk∣ed unto the Hill of <HI>Vienna,</HI> two <HI>English</HI> miles distant from the Town, going up all the way by an easie Ascent; from whence I had a prospect of the City, and the Campagnia about it, together with the high Mountains in <HI>Steirmark</HI> covered with Snow: and in my return saw the Palace of the Empress Dowager without the Town, called <HI>la Favo∣rita,</HI> and passed by the Convent of the <HI>Paulini.</HI></P>
<P>About two <HI>English</HI> miles Eastward from <HI>Vienna,</HI> there is a very noble Garden-place belonging to the Emperour, built by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Second, which hath been formerly
<PB N="101" REF="56"/> well furnished, and provided with Plants, but now seems to be neglected, and somewhat ruinous. It consisteth of an inward and an outward square Garden: The inward is two hundred ordinary paces square, about the same big∣ness with the Place Royal at <HI>Paris:</HI> It hath a <HI>Portico</HI> or <HI>Cloyster,</HI> supported by Forty Pillars of white Stone on each side, and is covered with Copper; as are also the Pavilions which the common people think to be Gold. Besides this, there is an handsome row of Buildings well seated, called <HI>Néw-gabaú,</HI> in which at present are many wild Beasts kept. Lions and Tigres breed here, and have young ones. Some say this was the place of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificents Tent when he besieged <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>There is also, about two or three miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> a noted place of Devotion, called <HI>Arnols,</HI> much frequen∣ted, especially in <HI>Lent,</HI> divers carrying Crosses very heavy all the way upon their shoulders. There is here a little House built exactly after that of the Sepulchre at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and also a handsome Copy of the Picture of our Saviour and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with their exact heights. That of our Saviour is about two yards high; that of the blessed Virgin three or four singers breadth lower: These are taken from the Original in St. <HI>John de Lateran</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> Hither the Empress desired to go one morning from her own Palace on foot, out of Devotion, which she perform∣ed, though with a great deal of difficulty, she being not used to walk, and the way was dusty. The Emperour accompanied her, and all the Court followed on foot, which made a handsome shew.</P>
<P>Nearer unto <HI>Vienna</HI> there is also a remarkable place for Devotion, called <HI>Itzing:</HI> and in the way from <HI>Vienna</HI> unto it, the twelve Stations of the Cross are marked out in imitation of what is observed near <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in the <HI>Via Crucis,</HI> or <HI>Dolorosa,</HI> in our Saviours proceeding from
<PB N="102" REF="57"/> the City unto Mount <HI>Calvary;</HI> the Figures thereof are printed, and the several paces between every Station set down. The Emperour hath a handsome Park near <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> called the <HI>Brater,</HI> wherein I beheld the effects of the great Lightning and Thunder which happened three days before, upon many great Trees which were torn, split, or twisted. There is a House of Pleasure in it, where among other things, I could not but take notice of a Musical Instrument which I had not seen before, a <HI>Seat</HI> or <HI>Chest-drum;</HI> it hath a Cord like that of a <HI>Sea-trumpet,</HI> but soundeth like a <HI>Kettle-drum.</HI></P>
<P>I went also unto <HI>Laxambourg,</HI> whither the Emperour often retireth; he hath a House in this place, but it is old, and not large. There is also a House of Pleasure in the Mote, into which there is no other passage but through a high <HI>Gorridore.</HI> The Castle is commodiously seated for the Emperours recreation; and there is an eight-square House in the <HI>Marsh,</HI> from which the Nobility and the Empress Dowager sometimes used to shoot, she being very expert therein. Over the Gate of the Emperours House hangs a great Rib and Jaw-bone, whereof I could get no better account, then they were the Rib and Jaw-bone of a heathen-maid. They seemed to me to be Bones of an <HI>Elephant</HI> But many things that are old or obscure, they call, in this Country, Heathen: as <HI>Roman</HI> Coyns, they call Heathen mony. And the Peasants brought me, in a place which had been formerly an old <HI>Roman</HI> Station, part of the bit of a Bridle digged up, which they concluded to be a Heathen Key.</P>
<P>From hence I went unto <HI>Mannersdorff,</HI> seated not far from the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> where there is a natural <HI>hot Bath,</HI> called the <HI>Wildebath;</HI> it ariseth under a Church, the Church being built over the Spring-head. The water of it is but Lukewarm, and therefore when they desire it hotter, they boyl it, and so bathe in Tubs in a large room.
<PB N="103" REF="57"/> From that Substance which sticketh to the sides of the Coppers in the boyling of it, they judge it to be impreg∣nated with <HI>Sulphur, Salt-peter,</HI> and <HI>Chalk.</HI> The water colours the stones, and makes them look, when wet, like fine <HI>Turquoises.</HI> And the vapour of the Bath hanging up∣on the Moss on the sides, gives it an Amber or Gold co∣lour. The Physicians of <HI>Vienna</HI> have given a good ac∣count concerning the use of these Baths in <HI>High-dutch.</HI> Not far from hence is a noted Quarry of Stone, out of which a great part of <HI>Vienna</HI> is built. The Stones being large they cut and square them at the Quarry.</P>
<P>From hence I proceeded to the <HI>Newsidler-sea</HI> or <HI>Lake,</HI> so called from <HI>Newsidle,</HI> which is a Town seated upon the Northern part of it, consisting of one street and some back-houses, and a small, square, old Castle upon a Hill, from whence I had a good prospect over the Lake. It is about three <HI>German</HI> miles broad, and seven miles long. The fairest Lake in these parts, affording plenty of Fish; encompassed and thickly set about with small Towns and Villages; and hath no River, at least not considerable, running into or out of it. A little way from the Gate of <HI>Newsidle</HI> they dig out a black earth, out of which they make <HI>Salt peter.</HI> In this Journey, not far from <HI>Himburg,</HI> we passed by a place called <HI>Rauckward,</HI> which, though it seems not high, looks over a great part of <HI>Austria,</HI> and as far as <HI>Brin,</HI> the second City of <HI>Moravia,</HI> a part also of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and a part of the Kingdom of <HI>Hungaria.</HI> I went afterwards four <HI>English</HI> miles up the Stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> to see a noted Quarry of Stone in a Hill called <HI>Altenburg.</HI> The beds, rows, or cases of the Stones lye not horizontally, but rather elevated Northward, about the height of the Angle forty, yet are not always so regularly placed, but rather follow the shape of the Hill, and according to that are differently
<PB N="104" REF="58"/> situated. Here I also observed a Substance between a Clay and a Stone called <HI>Leberstein,</HI> or <HI>Liverstone;</HI> and upon many of these Stones I found the figures of Trees and Leaves, though not so deep or neat as upon the Stones by <HI>Florence;</HI> yet very prettily marked, and often with broader Leaves than I had elsewhere observed. I passed forward to <HI>Closter-Neuburg,</HI> a Town most of it belonging to that notable rich Monastery seated here, founded by St. <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Marquess of <HI>Austria,</HI> and since much enriched by succeeding Donations.</P>
<P><HI>Matthaeus Merian</HI> hath a goodcut of the Prospect of the <HI>Danube</HI> here abouts, and in what manner it passeth down∣wards between the two great Hills of <HI>Kalenburg</HI> and <HI>Bisn∣burg.</HI> Upon one Peak of <HI>Kalenburg</HI> live divers <HI>Camal∣dulenses,</HI> of an Order the most severe of any, living most upon Roots and Herbs, in the manner of <HI>Hermites.</HI> Near their Cells they had paved the ground with those Stones I mentioned, which were naturally marked with the shapes of Trees and Plants.</P>
<P>After an open Autumn there followed a sharp Winter at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the months of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The branches of the <HI>Danube</HI> were soon frozen over. The main Stream, by reason of its swift Current, held out longer, but was afterwards also frozen. Some have thought that this River is more apt to freez than others. And we read of Battels which have been fought upon this River frozen; but I could not make any regular Observation thereof. This hard weather the ground being covered with Snow, afforded handsome Recreations unto men, and some unto the Ladies, in running Courses in handsome Sleds and Devices upon the Snow. Their Sleds were well contrived in the shape of <HI>Gryphins, Tigers, Swans, Scallop Shells, Dolphins, Peacocks,</HI> and the like Curiosities, carved, paint∣ed, and gilded. The Lady sits in one of these, richly ha∣bited
<PB N="105" REF="58"/> in Velvet, lined with rich Furrs, set off with Lace and Jewels, in a Velvet Cap lined with Sables. The Sled is drawn by a Horse, dressed up with Feathers of all co∣lours, and Bells hanging about him, a pair of Stags horns behind his head, Ribbons and other Ornaments: one or more Pages ride by on Horse-back with Torches in their hands. And after this manner they perform their Course upon the frozen Snow about the streets of <HI>Vienna</HI> in the night, with good speed one after another. A Gentleman sits behind the Lady and guides the Horse. But the Frost breaking up put an end to these Recreations. The Frost began and ended here the same day that it began and end∣ed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Festivity of <HI>Christmas</HI> was observed much after the same Manner, Ceremonies, and Solemnities as in <HI>Italy.</HI> On <HI>Christmas-day</HI> the Emperour dined publickly, attend∣ed with many Nobles and great Persons, and three re∣markable low Dwarfs. Upon St. <HI>Stephens-day</HI> he went to the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and went up to the Altar, kneeled, and kissed the Plate whereon the <HI>Hostia</HI> had lain. At the <HI>Epiphany</HI> or <HI>Twelfth-tide,</HI> the old custome of choo∣sing King and Queen was observed at Court. Count <HI>Lesley</HI> happened to be King, the Emperour laid the Cloath, and the Empress filled out Wine, together with other old Customes.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Christmas</HI> there was extraordinary mirth and jollity at the Court upon occasion of a Marriage: For Count <HI>Serau,</HI> Governour of <HI>Gratz</HI> in <HI>Styria,</HI> married a natural Daughter of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was observed with many noble Solemnities and Bravery. And the Nobility and Ladies were so sub∣stantially splendid, that I was much surprised there∣at.</P>
<PB N="106" REF="59"/>
<P>This was followed by a Funeral Solemnity for the Count of <HI>Draun,</HI> who was Colonel of the Forces in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and who had one of the noblest Houses in the City; his Corps was brought out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and interred in the <HI>Dominican</HI> Church, where he formerly built a very fair Altar, there was raised for him a <HI>Castrum Do∣loris,</HI> handsomely contrived and set round with white Wax Torches and Candles.</P>
<P>While I was in <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Empress <HI>Margarita</HI> was delivered of a Daughter, which was Christned by the Name of <HI>Maria, Antonina, Josepha, Benedicta, Rosalia, Petronella,</HI> but she lived not many months. When the Empress came abroad, she brought the Child to the <HI>Au∣gustines</HI> Church, where Cardinal <HI>Carlo Caraffa,</HI> the Pope's Nuncio, received it, blessed it, and laid it upon the Altar.</P>
<P>During my stay here, the Election was in readiness for a King of <HI>Poland,</HI> after the voluntary resignation of that Crown by King <HI>Casimir;</HI> and Couriers often passed be∣tween that Country and this. There were Competitors the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Son, the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> moved actively for the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> the Emperour for the Prince of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was then at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in great favour with the Emperour, who greatly promoted his interest; a Person of great esteem, and who, if General <HI>Lubomirski</HI> had been living, who was his intimate Friend, in all pro∣bability might have obtained the Crown; and thereupon it was conceived that he should have married the Emper∣our's Sister. But the <HI>Poles</HI> made choice of one of their own Country, who was no Competitor, <HI>Michael Wisno∣witski,</HI> lately deceased, who also married the Sister of the Emperour.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="59"/>
<P>When I was here, there were many Ambassadours of Note, <HI>Don Balthasar de la Cueva,</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Malagon,</HI> and brother to the Viceroy of <HI>Naples,</HI> was Ambassadour for <HI>Spain.</HI> Cardinal <HI>Carlo Caraffa</HI> was the Pope's Nuncio. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Ambassadour Extraordinary, solicited for assistance for <HI>Candia,</HI> and he obtained the Regiment of <HI>Porcia</HI> under Marquiss <HI>Pio.</HI> Count <HI>Souches</HI> the younger, who was Governour of <HI>Leopoldstadt,</HI> and many noble and valiant Souldiers were preparing for that Expedition. The <HI>Turks</HI> gave assurance of the <HI>Grand Signor</HI>'s intention to maintain the Peace inviolably; and requested the Em∣perour not to assist the <HI>Venetians</HI> or <HI>Transilvanians,</HI> nor to promote, but rather hinder, the Election of the Em∣perour of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Son to the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> The Bishop of <HI>Beziers,</HI> sent by the King of <HI>France</HI> to the E∣lection of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> came not hither, but pas∣sed through <HI>Nurenburg,</HI> where I lodged at the same Inn: They were generally here against the <HI>French</HI> Interest, and so were a great part of the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility. An Ambassa∣dour came also from the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> to confirm a Peace, and afford mutual Assistance upon occasion. <HI>Cha Gagi Aga</HI> was the Ambassadour, who brought a Present of the best <HI>Tartarian</HI> Horses, which are of high esteem for swiftness, hardiness, boldness in passing frozen Ri∣vers, and taking and swimming over great Streams. He was dismissed with noble Presents of Plate. The Em∣perour presented the <HI>Cham</HI> of Tartary with a fair Silver Bason and Ewer, and a curious Watch; and sent Presents unto the <HI>Chammine</HI> his Wife,; and also to his Sister and four Brothers. His Followers were stout men, of good stature, course Complexions, wearing long furr'd Vests and Calpack's, or furr'd Caps. Some of them had silver Rings with the same Signatures of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Seales. They took much Tobacco in very long Pipes. Their
<PB N="108" REF="60"/> Tobacco is not in Rolls, but in Leaves, and dry. They went about wandring and gazing at most things, as Chur∣ches, Houses, Shops: And took much delight to be in the Fair, where they would take much notice of small trifles. Yet these are the men that make such sad Incur∣sions into the Eastern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and carrying away so many thousands, sell them to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and so repair the defect of People in <HI>Turky.</HI> And now after the Con∣sumption of men in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the Country about by the Plague, are like to be active in that Trade, ho∣ping to find better Markets for their Plagiaries and De∣predations.</P>
<P>There are divers <HI>Greeks</HI> who trade to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and ma∣ny live in the Town, among which I met with three con∣siderable persons. One a grave Abbot, who was forced from his Convent by the <HI>Turk,</HI> upon suspicion that he cor∣responded with those of <HI>Candia.</HI> Another who went by the name of <HI>Constantinus Catacuzenos,</HI> and was of the Blood Royal of the <HI>Catacuzeni.</HI> The third was <HI>Jeremi∣as</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> Priest, who had travelled through <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and from thence through the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and intended for <HI>Con∣stantinople.</HI> He came into <HI>England</HI> to enquire after a young man who was in a Ship which was first taken by an <HI>Algerine,</HI> and afterwards by an <HI>English</HI> man of war in the <HI>Levant.</HI> He was very kindly used in <HI>England,</HI> and particu∣larly at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> He did a great deal of honour at <HI>Vienna</HI> unto the <HI>English</HI> Nation, declaring that they were the most civil, generous, and learned people he had met with in all his Travels, and that he no where found so many who could speak or understand <HI>Greek,</HI> or who gave him so good satisfaction in all parts of Knowledge: And as a testimony of his respect and gratitude, requested me to enclose a <HI>Greek</HI> Letter unto Dr. <HI>Pierson,</HI> now Lord
<PB N="109" REF="60"/> Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> now Master of <HI>Tri∣nity Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>Most men live here plentifully, there being abundance of all provision. They have great quantity of Corn, which upon Scarcity, by the help of the <HI>Danube,</HI> might be brought unto them from remoter parts. The Country affordeth such plenty of wine, that they send a conside∣rable quantity up the River. They have also rich wines out of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and such variety, that there are more than thirty several sorts of Wine to be sold in <HI>Vien∣na.</HI> They are not also without good Beer. <HI>Halstadt</HI> in <HI>Austria</HI> affordeth them Salt, where they make it by letting in water into the hollow parts of a Mountain, where it drinketh in the Salt of the Earth, and is afterwards let out and boiled up. This affordeth great profit to the Emperor, and therefore the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Salt is not permit∣ted to be brought higher than <HI>Presburg.</HI> They have also plenty of Sheep and Oxen; but for Oxen at present they are also supplied from <HI>Hungary,</HI> nor only from the Coun∣tries in the Emperours Dominions, but from the Turkish parts, by permission of the <HI>Grand Signor;</HI> and they are brought hither by the Eastern Company of <HI>Vienna.</HI> They eat much wild Boar, whereof the Fat is delicious, like that of Venison with us. They want not Hares, Rab∣bets, Partridges, Pheasants. A Fowl called <HI>Hasenhendal,</HI> or <HI>Gallina Corylorum,</HI> is much esteemed by them, which made me the more wonder to meet with some odde dishes at their Tables; as <HI>Guiny-pigs,</HI> divers sorts of <HI>Snails,</HI> and <HI>Tortoises.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Danube,</HI> and many Rivers which run into it, afford them plenty of Fish, extraordinary <HI>Carps, Trouts, Ten∣ches, Pikes, Eels,</HI> several sorts of <HI>Lampries,</HI> and many Fishes finely coloured; the white Fish, <HI>Crevises</HI> very large; the best come out of the River <HI>Swechet,</HI> not far
<PB N="110" REF="61"/> from <HI>Vienna.</HI> They have also that substantial large fish, called a <HI>Scheiden,</HI> or <HI>Silurus Gesneri,</HI> larger than <HI>Pike, Salmon,</HI> or any of our River Fishes; but the great Fishes called <HI>Hausons,</HI> or <HI>Husones,</HI> in <HI>Johnstonus,</HI> for largeness ex∣ceed all others; some being twenty foot long. Some think this to be the same Fish which <HI>Aelian</HI> nameth <HI>An∣tacetus,</HI> and speaketh largely of the fishing for them in <HI>Ister.</HI> I was at the fishing places for <HI>Hausons</HI> in <HI>Schut</HI> Island, between <HI>Presburg</HI> and <HI>Komara,</HI> for they come not usually higher, especially in shoals; and it is much that they come so high, for they are conceived to come out of the <HI>Euxine-sea,</HI> and so up the stream. They eat them both fresh and salted; they taste most like <HI>Sturgeon.</HI> It is a Cartilagineous Fish, consisting of gristles, and they have a hollow nervous chord all down the back, which being dried serveth for a whip. When they fish for them they blow a Horn or Trumpet, and know where they go by the moving of the water. From <HI>Venice</HI> they are supplied with Oysters, with salt <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> and some∣times with red <HI>Herrings,</HI> and great variety of other Fishes pickled up: as also with <HI>Oranges, Limons,</HI> and other Fruits. Observing much freedom, musick, and jollity in the City. I wondered how they could content them∣selves without Plays, for there were few while I was there, till the Players came hither out of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and a∣cted here for a time. The Jesuites would sometimes en∣tertain the Emperour and Empress with a Comedy at their Colledge; and I had once the favour to be at one when they were present.</P>
<P>But they have Dancing and Fencing often, and every <HI>Holy-day</HI> after dinner, the people flock to some Inns where there is Dancing in the inward Rooms, and Fencing and Playing of Prizes upon a Stage in the Yard; and at the Windows, or from the Galleries, behold the Fencers

<P>In Treason and high Crimes they cut off the right Hand of the Malefactor, and his Head immediately after. I saw a Woman beheaded sitting in a Chair, the Executioner striking off her Head with a Fore-blow, she behaved her self well, and was accompanied unto the Market place by the <HI>Confraternity</HI> of the <HI>Dead,</HI> who have a charitable care of such Persons, and are not of any Religious Order, but <HI>Lay men,</HI> among whom also in this place there are many Fraternities and Orders; as of the <HI>Holy Virgin,</HI> of the <HI>Holy Cross</HI> and others. Another person also executed after the same manner; as soon as his Head fell to the ground, while the Body was in the Chair, a man ran speedily with a Pot in his hand, and filling it with the Blood yet spouting out of his Neck, he presently drank it off, and ran away; and this he did as a Remedy against the <HI>Falling Sickness.</HI> I have read of some who have ap∣proved the same Medicine; and heard of others who have done the like in <HI>Germany.</HI> And <HI>Gelsus</HI> takes notice, that in his time some Epileptical persons did drink the Blood of the <HI>Gladiatours.</HI> But many Physicians have, in all times, abominated that Medicine. Nor did I stay after∣wards so long as to know the effect thereof, as to the in∣tended cure. But most men looked upon it as of great uncertainty: and of all men the Jews, who suffer no Blood to come into their Lips, must most dislike it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Presburg</HI> they have a strange way of Execution, still used at <HI>Metz,</HI> and some other places, by a Maid, or En∣gine like a Maid finely dressed up with her hands before her. The Malefactor salutes her first, and then retireth. But at his second salute she openeth her hands and cuts his Heart in sunder.</P>
<PB N="112" REF="64"/>
<P>Though the Winter was sharp, yet the advantage of Stoves, and lying between two Feather-beds, made it tolerable: For they use Stoves here as in other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> where they lodge and eat in Stoves; and great Persons have Stoves in the Church, or such as look into the Church. There are Stoves also in the publick Schools where Lectures are read. And this way of ly∣ing between two Feather-beds, with a neat laced sheet spread over, is more convenient in a cold Country, than most others they make use of. For in the common Inns in <HI>Germany</HI> they generally sleep upon Straw, and also in <HI>Hungary</HI> almost every where; and more Easterly upon the ground, spreading a Carpet or Saddle-cloath under them: and more Northerly they content themselves with the Skins of Beasts, <HI>Bears, Elks,</HI> or the like; upon which they sleep in the night. Those that sleep lowest are coolest in a Stove; those that lye upon Tables, Benches, or higher, are more exposed to the heat. The Citizens of <HI>Vienna</HI> are well attired, and use Furs very much. The Women wear a high Velvet Bonnet, lined or faced there∣with. The Place seemed to be healthful; but they speak much of the <HI>Colica Austriaca,</HI> as an Endemial and Local Disease, very hardly yielding unto good <HI>Medicines.</HI> They speak good <HI>German</HI> at the Court and in the City; but the Common and Country people seemed to speak grumb∣lingly, and besides their accent, have divers words different from other parts.</P>
<P>They have a Custome upon St. <HI>Nicholas-day</HI> to put some small Gift into the Childrens shoes; among other things they put in Medals and Dollars made of paper and flower gilded and silvered over, yet scarce worth a penny. They sell <HI>Trochies</HI> or <HI>Tablets</HI> in the Markets, made of the pulpe of the Fruit of <HI>Hip-briar,</HI> made sharp with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Sul∣phur,</HI> very refreshing. Some carry about them a <HI>Thunder∣stone,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="64"/> as a defence against Thunder: and they rub their Chil∣drens Gums with a <HI>Wolfs</HI> tooth instead of <HI>Coral.</HI></P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Venice</HI> in the time of the <HI>Carnival,</HI> I ob∣served many Recreations and Shews, as Rope-dancing, flying down the Rope, cutting off Bulls-necks with Swords, and many other. But at <HI>Vienna</HI> a notable trick which I saw there pleased me much: A man of a middle Stature laid down upon his back, and a heavy Anvil was placed upon his Breast, as much as two men could well lift, then two other men with great Hammers laid on, un∣til they had given almost an hundred blows, and cut in sun∣der a great Horshoe of iron, about half an inch thick.</P>
<P>Here is no Christian Religion publickly permitted but the <HI>Roman,</HI> and therefore those of the <HI>Protestant</HI> and <HI>Re∣formed Religion</HI> are fain to resort unto <HI>Presburg,</HI> Forty miles off, for which they have some convenience by the <HI>Danube,</HI> and a <HI>Coach</HI> which goeth every day. In the time of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Second, they were permitted the Ex∣ercise of their Religion in the Church of the <HI>Holy Cross,</HI> in the City of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But afterwards were prohibited by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Second. The Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> gave them permission to meet at <HI>Hernals,</HI> a little more than an <HI>English</HI> mile from <HI>Vienna;</HI> and gave leave to their <HI>Mini∣sters</HI> to come into the City, and there to <HI>christen, marry, baptize,</HI> and <HI>visit</HI> the <HI>sick.</HI> From which time they encrea∣sed very much, till <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, returning from the Battel of <HI>Prague,</HI> banished their <HI>Minister</HI> from <HI>Vi∣enna</HI> and <HI>Arnols;</HI> sent the <HI>Freyherr Jorger,</HI> to whom the Castle of <HI>Arnolds</HI> belonged, Prisoner unto <HI>Lintz;</HI> and never gave over till he had taken away their Priviledges and Freedom of meeting publickly in any part of <HI>lower Austria.</HI></P>
<P>But here are no small number of <HI>Jews,</HI> who have a di∣stinct Habitation assigned them over the Water. They have
<PB N="114" REF="65"/> also a Street allowed them in the City for the day time, but they must all depart at night beyond the River into the Suburbs.</P>
<P>They are much distasted by the Citizens and Trades∣men, and the Scholars agree but ill with them. While I was at <HI>Vienna</HI> there was a quarrel between them to an high degree. For the <HI>Scholars</HI> assaulted the <HI>Jews</HI> Town, beat, wounded, and threw divers of them into the Ri∣ver. Divers <HI>Scholars</HI> were wounded, some killed, and also some Souldiers who were commanded out to com∣pose the Fray: and the <HI>Jews</HI> Town was guarded many days by the Souldiers of the City. This begot such ill Blood and Complaints; that a good number of the <HI>Jews</HI> were to be banished at a certain day. The <HI>Jews,</HI> to in∣gratiate with the Empress, then with Child, presented her with a noble <HI>Silver Cradle,</HI> but she would not receive it. And there was great danger of the general banishment of them when I left that City, which was afterwards effe∣cted, they being severely prohibited from living, not on∣ly at <HI>Vienna,</HI> but in any part of <HI>Austria,</HI> where there were formerly whole Villages of them, so as they were forced to betake themselves into the Dominions of the <HI>Turk,</HI> unto <HI>Venice,</HI> into <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Bohemia.</HI> They be∣ing not permitted to dwell in the Neighbour Countries of <HI>Hungary</HI> subject to the Emperour, <HI>Styria,</HI> or <HI>Carinthia.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess they seemed useful unto the place for rea∣dy accommodation of any thing, either by sale or ex∣change, but the people looked with an evil eye upon them, as taking away much of their Trade and Employ∣ment. They also looked upon them as useless in war for defence of the place; and were not without some jealou∣sie that they held correspondence with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and gave Intelligence of their Affairs unto them. Yet the Souldiery dealt much with them, and Captains for the suddain ha∣biting,
<PB N="115" REF="65"/> furnishing, and accommodating of their Compa∣nies. And dining one day with a Commander at a <HI>Jews</HI> House, amongst other Discourse I asked the <HI>Jew</HI> con∣cerning the <HI>ten Tribes,</HI> and where they were? He said <HI>they were far off in</HI> Asia, <HI>beyond a great Lake which was continually stormy, and scarce passable, but upon their Sab∣bath-day, upon which days the Jews do not willingly travel.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen their <HI>Circumcision</HI> at <HI>Rome, Padua,</HI> and o∣ther parts. Their <HI>Physicians</HI> ordinarily profess great skill in <HI>Urines;</HI> and the common people resort unto them rather than unto <HI>Christians,</HI> and are so credulous, and have such an opinion of them, that they might be made to believe they have some old <HI>Receipts</HI> of King <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>There are many <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> yet they seem to me to be in greater numbers in <HI>Germany.</HI> In <HI>Amsterdam</HI> they are also grown very numerous. At <HI>Franckfurt</HI> they told me there were seven thousand of them, which seemed scarce credible. At <HI>Colen</HI> they are in great numbers: at <HI>Ham∣burg</HI> not a few. But the greatest number surely is in <HI>Prague.</HI></P>
<P>Though they be permitted in many Countries, yet di∣vers <HI>Christian Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> have assigned them some mark in their <HI>Habits,</HI> to distinguish them. In <HI>Avignon</HI> their <HI>Hats</HI> are <HI>yellow.</HI> In <HI>Italy</HI> their <HI>Hats</HI> are covered o∣ver with <HI>Taffate.</HI> In <HI>Germany</HI> they wear <HI>Ruffs</HI> and <HI>Gowns</HI> with great <HI>Capes.</HI> In <HI>Holland</HI> I observed no distinction. But the <HI>Jews</HI> there, most of them having come out of <HI>Portugal,</HI> there may be some suspicion of them from their Complexion.</P>
<P>Lastly, when I consider the old strength of <HI>Vienna,</HI> consisting in an old <HI>wall</HI> and a deep <HI>ditch,</HI> I cannot much wonder that <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> took this City. And I must ascribe it, under God, unto the singular valour and resolution of the Defendants, that
<PB N="116" REF="66"/> <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, with two hundred thousand men, was not able to take it, and though he made large brea∣ches, could never enter it, but lost some thousands at an Assault, and departed at last with the loss of a great part of his Army. But this place is now in a far better con∣dition, strongly fortified, and able to resist the greatest Forces of <HI>Turky.</HI> The <HI>houses</HI> are cleared from the <HI>wall;</HI> and yet for better security, when I was there, Count <HI>Souches</HI> advised the Emperour to pull down part of the <HI>Suburbs</HI> upon the other side of the nearest branch of the <HI>Danube,</HI> lest the <HI>Turks</HI> might take advantage to play up∣on the two <HI>Bastions</HI> on that side.</P>
<P>It would be a sad loss for <HI>Christendome</HI> if this place were in the hands of the <HI>Turk;</HI> and no man knows where he would rest. If he should begin with this place, and take it, the strong holds of <HI>Rab, Komara,</HI> and <HI>Leopold∣stadt</HI> would want their support, and soon fall into his pos∣session; and if he were Lord of <HI>Austria,</HI> a great part of <HI>Germany</HI> would lye bare unto him: and probably it would not be long before he visited <HI>Italy,</HI> into which Country he would then find other ways than by <HI>Palma nova.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM VIENNA IN AUSTRIA TO HAMBURG.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Aking a farewel of the <HI>Imperial City</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> I ordered my <HI>Journey</HI> for <HI>Prague</HI> in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which is usually six days Journey by Coach in the <HI>Summer,</HI> and eight in the <HI>Winter.</HI> I went over the great Bridge of <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> upon the large Stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> passing by the <HI>Chappel</HI> of St. <HI>Bridget,</HI> of an eight-square Figure. This <HI>Bridge</HI> is a
<PB N="118" REF="67"/> very great and massy work, supported by many high <HI>Trees,</HI> and <HI>Timber,</HI> and hath between two and three thou∣sand <HI>Trees</HI> laid upon it cross, or side by side, from one side of the <HI>Bridge</HI> to the other, for the passage over it, af∣ter the <HI>German</HI> manner of making <HI>Bridges.</HI> At <HI>Ratisbone</HI> there is a handsome <HI>Stone-bridge</HI> over the <HI>Danube,</HI> and between that place and <HI>Vienna,</HI> divers of <HI>Wood;</HI> but from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Belgrade</HI> I observed none but what were made with <HI>Boats.</HI></P>
<P>Having passed the <HI>River,</HI> I entred into the <HI>Trans-Danubian Austria,</HI> or that part of <HI>Austria</HI> which lieth between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the River <HI>Theya,</HI> and came unto <HI>Corneuburg,</HI> a pretty Town, about which place the Em∣perour often hunteth; it is near the Hill <HI>Bisneberg,</HI> which is opposite unto <HI>Kalenberg.</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> advanced far when they took this place in the last wars, and held it so well, that they were not easily forced out of it. From thence I came to <HI>Stockerau,</HI> near the mouth of the River <HI>Mida,</HI> where it runneth into the <HI>Danube.</HI> A place much noted for the death of St. <HI>Colman</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Saint, highly honoured in these parts. From thence to <HI>Guntersdorff,</HI> so to <HI>Colnedorff</HI> or <HI>Koldorff,</HI> which although it be on the South of the River <HI>Theya,</HI> is accounted the first <HI>Village</HI> of <HI>Moravia,</HI> and then came unto <HI>Znaim.</HI></P>
<P>In all this part of <HI>Austria,</HI> which extendeth a great length on the North-side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> conceived to have been anciently inhabited by the <HI>Marcomanni</HI> and <HI>Quadi,</HI> there are few or no <HI>Towns</HI> of <HI>antiquity, large∣ness,</HI> or <HI>note;</HI> for the <HI>Romans</HI> made their Stations and Colonies upon the South-side of the <HI>Danube;</HI> but the Country is full of Villages, and populous. One of the chiefest Towns is <HI>Crembs,</HI> which some call <HI>Cremona Au∣striae,</HI> which I saw as I came down the <HI>Danube.</HI> A great part of this Country was notably harrassed and plunder∣ed
<PB N="119" REF="67"/> by the <HI>Swedes.</HI> The <HI>Soyl</HI> is light, and easie to be ploughed.</P>
<P><HI>Znaim</HI> is a handsome place, with many painted Houses in it, and accounted the fourth chief <HI>Town</HI> in <HI>Mahren,</HI> or <HI>Moravia; Olmütz, Brün,</HI> and <HI>Iglaw</HI> being the other three, famous for the death of the Emperour <HI>Sigis∣mund.</HI> It is seated by the River <HI>Theya,</HI> which divideth <HI>Moravia</HI> from <HI>Austria,</HI> and running at last into the River <HI>Mark,</HI> affordeth accommodation of passage into the <HI>Da∣nube.</HI></P>
<P>From thence we passed by <HI>Ulverskirken, Paulitz,</HI> and <HI>Moravian Budweisse</HI> to <HI>Zimmaw,</HI> and by <HI>Byrnitz</HI> came to <HI>Igla,</HI> or <HI>Iglau,</HI> upon the River <HI>Igla,</HI> which at last run∣neth into the great River <HI>Marck,</HI> a very pleasant place, seated upon a Hill, on the Frontiers of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> It is well fortified <HI>à la moderna,</HI> upon one side, and hath one of the largest <HI>Piazza</HI>'s that I have seen.</P>
<P><HI>Moravia,</HI> is a pleasant and fruitful Country affording plenty of necessaries for life; the people are plain-dealing, stout, and make good Souldiers. It is commodiously furnished with Rivers, the greatest whereof is the <HI>Mora</HI> or <HI>Marck,</HI> which arising in the Northern part thereof, runneth quite through the Country, and entreth the <HI>Do∣naw</HI> not far from <HI>Presburg.</HI> The other considerable Streams are the <HI>Theya</HI> or <HI>Thaisa,</HI> the <HI>Swarta,</HI> the <HI>Schwitta,</HI> which run into the <HI>Marck.</HI> In the last <HI>Turkish</HI> wars the <HI>Tartars</HI> having passed the <HI>Wag</HI> in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> made incursi∣ons into <HI>Moravia,</HI> and carried away some thousands of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Igla,</HI> we soon came into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> first coming into <HI>Stecken,</HI> then to <HI>Teutchin Broda</HI> by the River <HI>Sac∣zua,</HI> formerly a strong place, taken by <HI>Zisca</HI> the famous <HI>Bohemian General,</HI> who then forced the Emperour <HI>Sigis∣mund</HI> to fly out of <HI>Bohemia</HI> by the way of <HI>Igla.</HI> From
<PB N="120" REF="68"/> thence we came to <HI>Heberne,</HI> and so to <HI>Janikaw:</HI> At this place, upon the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1643. was fought that memorable Battel between the <HI>Swedes,</HI> commanded by <HI>Leonard Torstenson,</HI> and the <HI>Imperialists</HI> under Count <HI>Hatzfield, Goetz,</HI> and other <HI>Commanders.</HI> The <HI>Imperi∣alists</HI> had the better at first; but falling upon the Enemies Baggage, and being too greedy of Booty, they were de∣feated, three thousand slain, four thousand taken prison∣ners, with their General <HI>Hatzfield,</HI> and six or seven Colo∣nels. The success hereof gave the <HI>Swedes</HI> advantage to proceed further, and into <HI>Silesia</HI> and <HI>Austria.</HI> In this Town meeting with a Gentleman who came from <HI>Schaclitz,</HI> which is not far from the <HI>Risgeburg,</HI> or <HI>Mountain of Gy∣ants,</HI> about the Head of the River <HI>Elbe,</HI> I enquired of him concerning the spirit <HI>Ribensal,</HI> which is said to infest that Country, but he could say nothing therein of his own knowledge; and though he was confident that there was such a Spirit, yet he confessed that for twelve years it had done no hurt. In <HI>Hills, Mountains,</HI> and places of <HI>Mines</HI> such reports are ordinary. It is reported that a Spirit haunts the <HI>Silver Mines</HI> of <HI>Brunswick:</HI> And ano∣ther to be in the <HI>Tinn Mine</HI> of <HI>Slackenwalde</HI> in this Coun∣try of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and to walk in the shape of a <HI>Monk,</HI> who strikes the <HI>Miners,</HI> sings and plays on the <HI>Bag-pipes,</HI> and doth many such Tricks. And <HI>Agricola</HI> in the latter end of his Sixth Book <HI>Dere Metallica,</HI> gives this for one reason why <HI>Mines,</HI> or <HI>passages</HI> in <HI>Mines,</HI> are given over.</P>
<P>From <HI>Janikaw</HI> I travelled to <HI>Czaslaw,</HI> a good Town, and the chiefest in the <HI>Czaslawer</HI> Circle: In this place they say that <HI>Zisca</HI> was buried, that famous <HI>Bohemian Ge∣neral;</HI> he lost one Eye by an <HI>Arrow,</HI> and was at length blind of both, yet gave not over the war, and proved successful in it. He wished his <HI>Friends</HI> to make a <HI>Drum</HI> of his <HI>Skin,</HI> which should serve to fright away their E∣nemies.
<PB N="121" REF="68"/> And though he cared not for any Sepulchral Monument, yet he had one in this place.</P>
<P>From <HI>Czaslaw</HI> we came to <HI>Guttenberg,</HI> or <HI>Cottenberg,</HI> about eight <HI>Bohemian</HI> miles from <HI>Prague,</HI> every mile be∣ing five or six <HI>English</HI> miles. A large Town, and much frequented, not far from the River <HI>Albis</HI> or <HI>Elbe,</HI> of e∣specal note for the <HI>Silver Mines</HI> about it: The <HI>Hills</HI> near it are not high, and consequently the Mines are not so deep as those of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and some others in <HI>Germa∣ny;</HI> yet some are above seventy or eighty <HI>Fathoms.</HI> They have wrought at these <HI>Mines</HI> seven hundred years, and there are about thirty of them. I went down into that which was first digged, but afterwards left for a long time, but they work there now again, it is called the <HI>Cot∣na,</HI> or <HI>Auf der Cotten,</HI> upon the <HI>Cotten,</HI> or <HI>Coat-hill;</HI> and as the Story goeth, a <HI>Monk</HI> walking over this Hill found a kind of a <HI>Silver Tree</HI> sticking to his Garment, which was the occasion that they afterwards digged and built these <HI>Mines,</HI> and the place retains the name of <HI>Cotten∣berg.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mine</HI> into which I descended near the Town, is but nineteen <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep; the chief <HI>Vein</HI> of the <HI>Ore</HI> runneth South, and is about a foot in breadth: the <HI>Ore</HI> holdeth or containeth in it <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Copper,</HI> so that out of an hundred pound weight of <HI>Ore,</HI> they ordinarily get an Ounce of <HI>Silver,</HI> and eight, nine, or ten ounces or more of <HI>Copper,</HI> even to pounds, but it is not well known, for the <HI>Copper-works</HI> are the Emperours. The <HI>Undertakers</HI> get out what <HI>Silver</HI> they can, and afterwards sell the <HI>Ore</HI> unto the Emperours Officers; but some <HI>Ore</HI> is sorich as to contain eight or nine ounces of <HI>Silver.</HI> A blew <HI>Earth</HI> which they meet with in digging, affords the best hopes of <HI>Ore.</HI> Two men lately perished in this <HI>Mine,</HI> having made a fire in it, being either choaked with the smoak, or,
<PB N="122" REF="69"/> as they thought, by the poysonous exhalations forced out of the Minerals by the fire. I have read that <HI>Libussa</HI> the Princess, and reputed Sorceress of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> foretold many things concerning these <HI>Mines;</HI> but certain it is, that for the advantage and profit these bring, the Town hath suffered much in many wars. The Emperour <HI>Sigis∣mund</HI> made haste out of it upon the approach of <HI>Zisca,</HI> and seeing he could not hold it, burnt the Town; but it was soon rebuilt and possessed by <HI>Zisca,</HI> whose party called it the <HI>Purse of Antichrist.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Cottenburg,</HI> I came to <HI>Colline</HI> and to <HI>Bohemi∣an Broda,</HI> so named to distinguish it from <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Teu∣tonick Broda</HI> before mentioned, a considerable good Town, and from thence came to <HI>Prag,</HI> or <HI>Prague,</HI> the Capital and Royal City of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The <HI>Walls</HI> of this City seem to enclose the greatest Citcuit of ground of any I have seen in <HI>Germany,</HI> but the Hills and void spaces within it take up a large Tract, and therein it is like the City of <HI>Lyon</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> it is seated upon the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> by the <HI>Bohemians</HI> named <HI>Ultaue,</HI> a large rapid River, arising in the South part of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and before at arriveth at <HI>Prague,</HI> receiveth the River <HI>Sarsua</HI> and the <HI>Watta</HI> into it; and Northward of <HI>Prague</HI> the River <HI>Egra,</HI> and joyneth with the <HI>Elbe.</HI></P>
<P>This great place consisteth of three Towns, named the <HI>Old,</HI> the <HI>New,</HI> and the <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>lesser Town.</HI> The <HI>old Town</HI> lieth upon the East of the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> is very populous, full of Buildings, private and pub∣lick. Very considerable in this part is also the Universi∣ty, wherein are great numbers of Students and Scholars, there being but one University in <HI>Bohemia;</HI> many persons also resorting thither from other Countries. It is scarce credible what is reported of the number of Scholars in <HI>Prague</HI> in former Ages, as hath been delivered by divers
<PB N="123" REF="69"/> Authors. And <HI>Lewis du May,</HI> Counsellor unto the Duke of <HI>Wittenburg,</HI> affirmeth, That there are at present scarce so many Students in all <HI>Germany,</HI> as there were at <HI>Prague</HI> in the year 1409. when they reckoned above Forty thousand under the <HI>Rectorship</HI> of <HI>John Hus. Charles</HI> the Fourth, Emperour, and King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> founded the <HI>University</HI> of <HI>Prague,</HI> giving equal priviledges to the <HI>Bohemians, Polanders,</HI> and <HI>Germans:</HI> and when he would re∣trench his favours towards Strangers, there went out of the Town in a weeks time twenty four thousand Scholars, and a little after, sixteen thousand, whereby we may judge there were more Scholars in <HI>Prague</HI> than other persons in some great Cities. There are also in this <HI>old Town</HI> di∣vers <HI>Colledges</HI> and <HI>Cloysters.</HI> The <HI>Jesuites</HI> have a fair, handsome <HI>Colledge,</HI> near unto the <HI>Bridge,</HI> but the <HI>Build∣ings</HI> of the <HI>old Town</HI> are inferiour to those of the <HI>lesser Town.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>new Town</HI> is large, and together with the River, encompasseth the <HI>old,</HI> and is divided from it by a large <HI>Trench</HI> or <HI>Ditch,</HI> in o which they can let in the River. The <HI>Irish</HI> have a <HI>Cloyster</HI> of <HI>Franciscans</HI> near unto an old <HI>Tower</HI> in the <HI>Wall</HI> of the <HI>old Town.</HI> The <HI>Jesuites</HI> have also be∣gun a large <HI>Cloyster,</HI> which, if finished according to its beginning and design, will be very spacious and noble. They are now making <HI>Bastions</HI> about the <HI>Town</HI> at one end thereof; there is also a <HI>Citadel,</HI> but not finished, at <HI>Wisse∣raht,</HI> or <HI>Wissegrade,</HI> formerly the Seat of the Princes of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and also of the famous Princess <HI>Libussa,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Crocus,</HI> and Wife unto <HI>Primislaus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>lesser Prague,</HI> far exceedeth the other for pleasantness and beauty of Buildings and fair Palaces. This part lieth Westward of the River <HI>Mul∣daw,</HI> which between this and the <HI>old Town,</HI> is passable by a strong <HI>Stone-bridge,</HI> consisting of sixteen great Arches,
<PB N="124" REF="70"/> being about Seventeen hundred foot long, and Thirty five foot broad, and two open Gates under two high Towers of Stone at each end. A great part of this Town lieth high, and upon the Hill standeth <HI>Hratschin,</HI> or <HI>Upper Prague,</HI> and a Summer House of the Emperours, besides a Magnificent Palace of the Emperours, as King of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and by it a fair <HI>Cathedral Church</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Veit,</HI> first built by St. <HI>Wenceslaus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> 923. from whence the Town and River is best viewed. In this Church are divers <HI>old Monuments</HI> for great Per∣sons; as for <HI>Pogiebrachius</HI> a <HI>Bohemian</HI> King, <HI>Wenceslaus, Rodolphus</HI> the Second, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Ladislaus, Maximilian</HI> the Second, and other <HI>Arch-Dukes</HI> and <HI>Em∣perours.</HI> There are also many Houses of the <HI>Nobility</HI> in this part of the City. The Palace and Garden of <HI>Colare∣do</HI> is exceeding neat, though small. But I was most plea∣sed with the Palace of Count <HI>Wallensteyn,</HI> Duke of <HI>Fried∣land,</HI> General unto the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, who being suspected to Usurp that Kingdom, was after∣wards killed at <HI>Egra.</HI> This Palace was built upon the Ruins of an hundred Houses, purposely plucked down to make room for it; wherein the Hall is large, the Gar∣den handsome; upon one side whereof there is a place to manage Horses, and near unto it a Fish-pond: in ano∣ther part there is a noble <HI>Aviary</HI> with a Garden and Trees in it, after the manner of the <HI>Aviary</HI> of Prince <HI>Doria</HI> at <HI>Genoa,</HI> which is eighty paces long, and eighteen broad. The Stable is large, and worth the seeing, wherein there is a <HI>Marble Pillar</HI> between each Horse, and for every Horse there is placed in a nich of the Wall a Rack of Steel, and Manger of Marble, and over his Head hangeth a Picture of the Horse, as big as the Life, with his Name under it. Among the rest, I observed that a Bay-horse had for his Name <HI>Monte d'Oro,</HI> a Mare, <HI>Bella donna,</HI> ano∣ther
<PB N="125" REF="70"/> <HI>Espagnoletta,</HI> and his most beloved Horse was named <HI>Mas Querido.</HI></P>
<P>Some have thought that the best <HI>high German</HI> is spoken in this part of <HI>Prague;</HI> and there living so many of the Nobility and great Persons, it is not to be wondred at, that their Language is better than ordinary. But the common Language of <HI>Bohemia</HI> is a Dialect of the <HI>Sclavoni∣an,</HI> though very many speak also <HI>High dutch,</HI> as we found in all our passage through that Country. <HI>Koningsmark</HI> being with his Forces on the Frontiers of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> a discontented Colonel of the <HI>Imperialists</HI> came unto him, making it probable that he might surprize <HI>Hratschin,</HI> and the lesser side of <HI>Prague,</HI> which he suddainly attempted, and so successfully, that he surprized many Officers, and old <HI>Colaredo</HI> in his Bed, getting so great a Booty, that he could scarce carry it away.</P>
<P>A part of <HI>Prague</HI> is inhabited by Jews, and called the <HI>Jews Town;</HI> there are no small number of them, and ma∣ny rich, as trading in all Commodities, and have good skill in Jewels, and several sorts of Stones digged out of the <HI>Mines</HI> in <HI>Bohemia:</HI> I bought some <HI>Bohemian Topazes</HI> of them, neatly cut and well-figured, and some which were very large and clear, were at the rate of seven or eight <HI>Dollars.</HI> During my stay here, I had a great desire to have saluted <HI>Johannes Marcus-Marci,</HI> a famous Physici∣an and Philosopher of <HI>Prague,</HI> and also to have induced him to a Correspondence with the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> but I understood that he had left this World, to the great grief of Learned Men in these and other parts.</P>
<P>Many here do speak still of <HI>John Hus</HI> and <HI>Jerome</HI> of <HI>Prague,</HI> and I have seen <HI>Silver Medals</HI> of them. They were surely very notable men; and I shall only set down what <HI>Aeneas Sylvius,</HI> or Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the Second said of them. <HI>Jo∣hannes aetate major &amp; authoritate, doctrinâ &amp; facundiâ su∣perior
<PB N="126" REF="71"/> Hieronymus, pertulerunt ambo constanti animo necem, &amp; quasi ad Epulum invitati ad incendium properarunt, nul∣lam emittentes vocem quae miseri animi posset ferre indicium: ubi ardere ceperunt, hymnum cecinere quem vix flamma &amp; fragor ignis intercipere potuit, nemo Philosophorum tam forti animo mortem pertulisse traditur quam isti incendium. In Hist. Bohemica. John</HI> was or greater years and autho∣rity, <HI>Jerome</HI> of more Eloquence and Learning: both of them endured their Death with great constancy, and went unto the fire as though invited to a Banquet: when they began to burn, they sung an Hymn, which the flame and fire could scarce intercept. None of the old Philosophers endured their death with such a courageous mind as these the fire.</P>
<P>The same Author compareth <HI>Prague</HI> unto the City of <HI>Florence</HI> in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> wherefore having seen both places, I cannot omit to say something. I had a view of the Ci∣ty of <HI>Florence</HI> from the top of the <HI>Domo,</HI> or <HI>Cathedral,</HI> and of <HI>Prague</HI> from the Church of St. <HI>Veit,</HI> upon the Hill in the lesser Town: <HI>Prague</HI> seemed to my eye to contain a far greater Circuit than <HI>Florence;</HI> it seemed also more populous, and to exceed it very much in the number of People, the Streets larger, and the Windows of Palaces and fair Houses being of Glass, looked not so tatterdly as the ragged Paper Windows of <HI>Florence.</HI> The River <HI>Arno,</HI> which runs through <HI>Florence,</HI> is not to be compa∣red with the <HI>Muldau</HI> at <HI>Prague,</HI> having run about an hun∣dred miles from its Head. The large, massy, long Stone-Bridge exceedeth any of, if not all, the four Bridges of <HI>Flo∣rence.</HI> The Emperours Palace also upon the Hill is very stately: But as for the well-paved Streets of <HI>Florence,</HI> the <HI>Domo</HI> or <HI>Cathedral</HI> with black and white Marble, with a <HI>Cupola,</HI> second only to that of St. <HI>Peters</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> for the incomparable <HI>Chappel</HI> of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and the <HI>Dukes
<PB N="127" REF="71"/> Gallery</HI> and <HI>Rarities,</HI> I must confess I saw not any thing in <HI>Prague</HI> which answered them. At <HI>Weissenberg,</HI> or the <HI>white Hill</HI> near <HI>Prague,</HI> that deciding Battel was fought <HI>Novemb.</HI> 8. 1620. between <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> elected King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Forces of the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, which gave such a deep blow unto the <HI>Protestant Party,</HI> wherein so many of <HI>Frederick</HI>'s Forces were slain and drowned in the River in their slight, wherein also that famous Commander <HI>Pa∣penheim</HI> was found lying among the dead, who notwith∣standing died not of his wounds, but was reserved to end his days with the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the memorable Battel of <HI>Lutzen.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Prague</HI> I designed to pass by water down the <HI>Muldaw,</HI> which uniteth with the <HI>Elbe</HI> about <HI>Melnick,</HI> and so down the <HI>Elbe</HI> unto <HI>Hamburg.</HI> But the Winter advan∣cing, and the Weather proving cold, the Boats did not go as in Summer, and therefore I took my Journey by Land, and leaving <HI>Prague</HI> and the <HI>Muldau</HI> on the right hand, I passed the first day to <HI>Zagethal,</HI> the next to <HI>We∣luerne,</HI> and so to <HI>Budin</HI> and <HI>Labasitz</HI> upon the <HI>Elbe.</HI> Ha∣ving passed over the <HI>Egra,</HI> a considerable River, arising not far from the City of <HI>Egra,</HI> and at last running into the <HI>Elbe;</HI> the next day by the Castle of <HI>Kriegstein,</HI> or <HI>Warrestone,</HI> seated upon a high steep Rock, I came to <HI>Ausig,</HI> a small City not far from the <HI>Elbe,</HI> having little remarkable in it, like many other small Cities of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and so forward to <HI>Nolndorff,</HI> where we lodged upon Mount <HI>Kninsberg,</HI> the day after we entred into <HI>Misnia,</HI> passing by <HI>Peterswald,</HI> and <HI>Hellendorff</HI> the first Village in <HI>Misnia,</HI> and <HI>Kisibel,</HI> where are <HI>Iron Mines</HI> about eigh∣teen Fathoms deep, and <HI>Iron works.</HI></P>
<P>We now understood that <HI>Bohemia</HI> was a larger Country than we expected; it lieth round, and some say it is three
<PB N="128" REF="72"/> days postage over; others that the Diameter extendeth two hundred miles. From <HI>Igla</HI> upon the Confines unto <HI>Hellendorff,</HI> it took me nine days Journey in <HI>November</HI> by <HI>Coach,</HI> not reckoning the time I staid at <HI>Prague.</HI> In many places there are very ill Passages, and so rudely mended with great Trees, laid side by side, that they are often very troublesome to pass.</P>
<P>We travelled afterwards towards <HI>Dresden,</HI> in a fruitful Country, wherein were many <HI>Deer</HI> in most parts of the way, in sight of the Castle of <HI>Pilnitz,</HI> a strong place, and seated high. I could not but cast an eye on the <HI>Rocks</HI> behind us in the Forest of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which looked like the Ruines of a Wall which formerly enclosed <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which Country is described with a Forest or Woods round about it. But I confess I did not really perceive that there was such a Wood round about it as is common∣ly set forth in <HI>Mapps;</HI> only both within, and also in many parts of the Borders, there are great Woods which are conceived to have been part of the <HI>Hercinian Forest.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> are a strong, stout, and hardy People, make good Souldiers, and have made great wars both at home and abroad; and <HI>Histories</HI> are full of their warlike Exploits. The chief <HI>Magazine</HI> of the King is at <HI>Egra,</HI> a strong City, accounted the Second of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The Country affordeth also lusty and strong Horses. The common sort of People are boysterous, rough, and quarrel∣some, especially in drink, whereto they are too much addicted. The Nobility and Gentry are civil and kind unto Strangers. There are many great Families of the Nobility, among which that of <HI>Rosenberg</HI> and <HI>Popel</HI> is an∣cient, and of high esteem. Since the unhappy accepting of the Crown by <HI>Frederick</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the ill success upon it, there hath been a great alteration in this Country, both as to People and their Manners; for there∣upon
<PB N="129" REF="72"/> many thousands left the Kingdom, and many who re∣mained, turned their Religion. And the Emperours have used the like severity upon others in their Hereditary Dominions.</P>
<P>The next considerable place we came unto was <HI>Dres∣den</HI> in <HI>Misnia,</HI> as well worth the seeing, as almost any Town in <HI>Germany. Dresden</HI> is the Seat and Residence of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> seated upon the River <HI>Elbe,</HI> over which there is a very noble Stone-bridge of Seventeen Arches. The City is very well fortified after the Mo∣dern way, the <HI>Bastions Revestues,</HI> and in each <HI>Bastion</HI> a <HI>Cavallier:</HI> It hath also a large <HI>Trench</HI> or <HI>Ditch</HI> about it, in some places double; and the River <HI>Elbe</HI> addeth unto its strength. The Walls are very strong: and they say, that when the first Stone was laid to build them, there was placed in the Earth a <HI>Silver Cup</HI> gilded, a <HI>Book</HI> of the <HI>Laws,</HI> and another of <HI>Coyns,</HI> and three <HI>Glasses</HI> filled with <HI>Wine.</HI> It hath also three Gates. The places most worth the seeing are these: The <HI>Italian</HI> Garden in the Suburbs; the <HI>Hunters House</HI> in the <HI>old Town</HI> beyond the <HI>River;</HI> the <HI>Electors Palace;</HI> his <HI>House</HI> for <HI>wild Beasts;</HI> his <HI>Stable∣house</HI> and <HI>Arsenal,</HI> of which I shall set down some things observable in their kind. In the <HI>Electors Palace,</HI> the <HI>Hall</HI> is very large, and handsomely painted with Cities, Gy∣ants, and the Habits of several Nations, and set out with seven large branched Candlesticks: But that which af∣fordeth the greatest delight is his <HI>Kunstkammer, Art-Chamber,</HI> or <HI>Collection of Rarities,</HI> both of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Na∣ture.</HI> In the first Partition are to be seen all manner of well-made <HI>Instruments</HI> belonging to most <HI>Trades,</HI> as <HI>Joyners, Turners, Barbers, Smiths, Chirurgeons,</HI> and o∣ther <HI>Artificers: Instruments</HI> to force open <HI>Doors, Chests, &amp;c.</HI> In the other Chambers these and the like are obser∣vable.</P>

The <HI>Horn Gallery</HI> is also remarkable in this place, out of which there are three Chambers; one painted with seve∣ral sorts of <HI>Hunting;</HI> another with all sorts of <HI>Fowl;</HI> and a third with great variety of <HI>Beasts.</HI></P>

<P>In the <HI>House</HI> for <HI>wild Beasts</HI> I took notice of a <HI>Marian,</HI> which is a four-footed Beast, that hangeth upon <HI>Trees</HI> by the <HI>Tail.</HI> Also a <HI>wild</HI> or <HI>Mountain-Cat</HI> of a large size. Five <HI>young Bears.</HI> Five <HI>old black Bears.</HI> A <HI>white Bear</HI> very large; the <HI>feet,</HI> the <HI>head,</HI> and the <HI>neck</HI> are longer than those of the <HI>black,</HI> but not so thick.

<P>The <HI>Italian Garden</HI> and <HI>Summer-house</HI> in the <HI>Suburbs</HI> is very noble, wherein are two <HI>Obelisks,</HI> two gallant <HI>Fountains,</HI> a <HI>Theatre</HI> and good <HI>Landskips.</HI> This <HI>Garden</HI> and <HI>Summer house</HI> were built by two of the Prince Ele∣ctour's <HI>Eunuchs,</HI> and afterwards sold unto the Prince for Six and twenty thousand <HI>Dollars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dresden</HI> is but a late City, and was formerly a Village. The <HI>Churfurst,</HI> or <HI>Elector,</HI> was not in the Town; but the <HI>Chur-prince</HI> his Son was there: A Person rather of low than middle <HI>Stature,</HI> his Hair long and yellow, his Face ruddy, his Body well set and active, and he is very well beloved. The present Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> is <HI>John George</HI> the Second, <HI>Grand Marshal</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> a great and powerful Prince, who keeps a <HI>Royal Court</HI> and <HI>Attendance,</HI> having his <HI>Guards</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> after the manner of <HI>Kings.</HI> His <HI>Dominions</HI> lye in <HI>Misnia, Thuringia Voytland,</HI> and part of <HI>Lusatia.</HI> His <HI>Revenues</HI> are large, from <HI>Impositi∣ons</HI> upon <HI>Commodities.</HI> His <HI>Profits</HI> great, from the Tax upon <HI>Beer,</HI> which ariseth to no small sum, especially in <HI>Wittenberg, Torga,</HI> and <HI>Leipsick.</HI> And his <HI>Silver Mines</HI> are considerable. And the <HI>Funeral</HI> of the last Electour <HI>Joannes Georgius</HI> the First, was very magnificent 1657. at which there were twenty four <HI>Horses</HI> of <HI>State</HI> covered with <HI>black,</HI> and the Electoral <HI>Escutcheon</HI> embroydered
<PB N="134" REF="78"/> thereon, and every one led by two Gentlemen, and three thousand five hundred persons in mourning.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Luthers</HI> Holiday was kept when I was there. The chief Church is very fair: They preach every morning at seven a Clock. The <HI>Lutheran</HI> women mourn in <HI>white,</HI> as others do in <HI>Black:</HI> and the woman of the House doth ordinarily say Grace instead of the man. The best <HI>High∣dutch</HI> is spoken in this place, and other parts of <HI>Misnia,</HI> which is a very pleasant fruitful Country, and full of good Towns and Villages.</P>
<P>Leaving this noble place, I took not the nearest Road, but turned out of the way unto <HI>Freiberg,</HI> a place noted for <HI>Silver Mines;</HI> whereof I had read something in <HI>A∣gricola,</HI> and heard very much in these parts. About an <HI>English</HI> mile or two from <HI>Freiberg,</HI> there are many remar∣kable <HI>Mines.</HI> I took notice of three of them: One called <HI>Auff den hohen berg,</HI> or <HI>upon the high Hill,</HI> which is the deepest in these parts, as being seventy seven of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep; each of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> contains twelve of their <HI>Ells,</HI> and three of their <HI>Ells</HI> makes one of our <HI>Fa∣thoms.</HI> So that the depth of this <HI>Mine</HI> exceedeth any of those wherein I was in <HI>Hungary.</HI> There is another <HI>Mine</HI> called <HI>Himmelfurst,</HI> or the <HI>Prince of Heaven,</HI> where∣in not long since there was <HI>Ore</HI> found so rich, as in an hundred pounds weight to contain an hundred and thirty Marks of <HI>Silver,</HI> or sixty five pounds in the hundred, but there was not much of it: And where the <HI>Veyns</HI> are richest, they are observed to be thinest, about two sin∣gers broad; but the ordinary <HI>Ore</HI> is but poor, holding an ounce, or an ounce and a half, in an hundred pounds weight; and if it holdeth but half an ounce they work it. Nor is this much to be wondered at, for in the vast rich <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> they will work the <HI>Silver Ore</HI> which containeth four or five ounces in a hundred pound
<PB N="135" REF="78"/> weight, and ten or twelve ounces is the ordinary rate of the common <HI>Ore</HI> of that rich Mountain of <HI>Potosi,</HI> out of which Hill alone, if we believe <HI>Albero Alonso Barba,</HI> Cu∣rate of the Parish of St. <HI>Bernard</HI> in that City, there hath been more <HI>Silver</HI> taken than would cover all <HI>Misnia</HI> o∣ver and over: For thus he saith, Potosi <HI>hath already yielded between four and five hundred Millions of pieces of Eight.</HI> A quantity sufficient to make such another Hill of <HI>Silver:</HI> It is hard to form a conception equal unto so exorbitant a heap of Riches; but the better to help our imagination herein, know, that if the Ground were cove∣red with so many pieces of Eight, laid as close to one another as is possible, they would take up the space of six∣ty Leagues square.</P>
<P>Here at <HI>Freiberg</HI> they have many ways to open the <HI>Ore</HI> whereby it may be melted; as by <HI>Lead</HI> and a sort of <HI>Sil∣ver Ore</HI> which holds <HI>Lead</HI> in it. They have also <HI>Sulphur Ore</HI> found here, which after it is burned, doth help much towards the fusion of <HI>Metals:</HI> And besides these, <HI>Slich,</HI> or pounded and washed <HI>Ore;</HI> and <HI>Slacken,</HI> which is the Dross or Cake, or Skum taken out of the <HI>Vortiegel,</HI> or <HI>Pan</HI> which receiveth the <HI>melted Minerals</HI> let out at the bottom of the <HI>melting Furnace.</HI> Their <HI>Treibshearth,</HI> or <HI>driving Furnace,</HI> where the <HI>Litharge</HI> is driven off, agreeth better with the Figure of it in <HI>Agricola,</HI> than those of <HI>Hungary;</HI> some of the <HI>Litharge</HI> is green: Their <HI>Buck∣work</HI> and their <HI>Engines</HI> which pound the <HI>Ore,</HI> the <HI>Coal,</HI> and <HI>Clay,</HI> are also very neat. Much of their <HI>Ore</HI> is washed, especially the poorest, and that which is mixed with <HI>stones, quarts,</HI> or <HI>sparrs.</HI></P>
<P>This is peculiar in their working, that they burn the pounded and washed <HI>Ore</HI> in the <HI>Roasthearth,</HI> before they melt it in the <HI>Smeltzoven,</HI> or <HI>melting Furnace.</HI></P>
<PB N="136" REF="79"/>
<P>At these <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> where I was, they used not the <HI>Virgula divina,</HI> or forked Hazel, to find out <HI>Silver Ore,</HI> or hidden Treasure in the Earth; and I should little depend thereon: but here they have an esteem of it. And I observed the use thereof, and the manner how they did it. But I shall omit the Description of it, because it is set down in divers Books, and it cannot be so well de∣scribed as shown to the Eye.</P>
<P>I saw also another <HI>Mine,</HI> called <HI>Auff der Halsbrucker,</HI> about eighty of our <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep, and much worked: They have divers sorts of <HI>Ore;</HI> but they contain either <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Copper, Silver</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> or all three; but they work them only for <HI>Silver.</HI> They have divers <HI>damps</HI> in these <HI>Mines,</HI> where it is deep. The <HI>Mines</HI> are cold where the outward Air comes in; but where not, warm. The greatest trouble they have is by dust, which spoileth their <HI>Lungs</HI> and <HI>Stomachs,</HI> and frets their <HI>Skins.</HI> But they are not so much troubled with water; and have ve∣ry good <HI>Engins</HI> to draw the water out.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sulphur,</HI> or <HI>Brimstone Ore</HI> which is found here, is also rich; it is hard and stony, as other <HI>Ores</HI> are: that which hath <HI>red spots</HI> is accounted the best. They use a peculiar <HI>Furnace</HI> to melt the <HI>Brimstone</HI> from the <HI>Ore;</HI> some whereof yieldeth three pounds of <HI>Sulphur</HI> out of an hundred weight of <HI>Ore,</HI> which as it melteth runneth out of the <HI>Furnace</HI> into water, or the Exhalations from the <HI>Ore</HI> near or in the Fire, are condensed into <HI>Brimstone</HI> by the Surface of the Water placed to receive it; this is once again melted and purified. Some of the <HI>Brimstone Ore</HI> containeth <HI>Silver,</HI> some <HI>Copper,</HI> and some both in a small proportion.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Sulphur</HI> is melted from the <HI>Ore,</HI> the remain∣der serveth for two uses; that is, either for the melting of <HI>Silver,</HI> or for the making of <HI>Vitriol:</HI> To the former only

<PB N="137" REF="81"/> thus; A proportion is cast into the melting <HI>Furnace</HI> of the <HI>Silver,</HI> to this end, to use the <HI>Miners</HI> expression, to make the <HI>Silver</HI> which is hard, fluid.</P>
<P>The other use, and which is more considerable, is for the making of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> or <HI>Copperose</HI> in this manner: They take the <HI>Ore</HI> out of which the <HI>Brimstone</HI> hath been already melted, and burn it once again, or let it still burn in the open Air; then putting it into a large Fatt, they pour water upon it, so as to imbibe and drink in the <HI>Vitriol;</HI> this Water is afterwards boyled to a sufficient height, and let out into the Coolers, where sticks are set in it, as in the making of <HI>Sugar Candy:</HI> The purest Chrystallized <HI>Vitriol</HI> sticks unto the wood, the rest to the sides and bot∣tom. Thus the <HI>Sulphur Ore,</HI> after the <HI>Sulphur</HI> is taken out of it, still worketh upon the <HI>Silver Ore,</HI> and openeth the Body of it in the Fire; but when this <HI>Ore</HI> is also de∣prived of its <HI>Vitriol,</HI> it worketh no more upon <HI>Me∣tals.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friberg</HI> is a round well-walled City; hath handsome Streets, a <HI>Piazza,</HI> the Elector's Castle, and five Gates. the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is fair, where many of the Dukes and Ducal Family have been buried, and have fair Monu∣ments; especially Duke <HI>Mauritius,</HI> Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> whose Monument in <HI>black Marble</HI> is raised three piles high, adorned with many fair <HI>Statua's</HI> in <HI>Alabaster</HI> and <HI>white Marble,</HI> and esteemed one of the noblest, if not the best, in <HI>Germany.</HI> And when this Town was surrendred unto <HI>Holck</HI> and <HI>Gallas, Octob.</HI> 5. 1632. the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> paid 80000 <HI>Dollars</HI> to save the Monuments of his Prede∣cessours from being ransacked and defaced, it being the fashion of divers <HI>German</HI> Princes to be buried in their <HI>Robes,</HI> with their <HI>Ensigns</HI> of <HI>Honour, Rings, Jewels,</HI> and the like, which would have been booty, and probably have run the same fortune as the <HI>Cloister</HI> of <HI>Haibron,</HI> within
<PB N="138" REF="82"/> twelve <HI>English</HI> miles of <HI>Nurenberg,</HI> where some of the Marquisses of <HI>Onspach,</HI> who are of the Electoral House of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> lye entombed, where <HI>Tillie</HI>'s Souldiers brake open the <HI>Vault,</HI> and robbed the <HI>dead Corpses</HI> of the Marquisses, <HI>George Frederick,</HI> and <HI>Joachim Ernest,</HI> of the <HI>Jewels, Rings,</HI> and other rich <HI>Ornaments</HI> with which they were entombed.</P>
<P>There are some Vaults and Subterraneous Cavities in the City, by which there are passages into the <HI>Mines.</HI> This place was formerly streightly besieged by the Em∣perour <HI>Adolphus,</HI> for the space of a year and a month, and at last betrayed by a <HI>Fugitive,</HI> who let in a party of the Emperours into the Town by a Subterraneous Pas∣sage near St. <HI>Donats</HI> Gate, and upon the continual Batte∣ries made at the Town, and concussion of the Earth a∣bout it, the Earth sunk down in many places, and swal∣lowed great numbers of the Emperours Army.</P>
<P>These <HI>Mines</HI> afford great benefit unto the City, and also unto the Elector; They are said to have been found out in the year 1180. But there have been other <HI>Silver Mines</HI> discovered since; as at <HI>Schneeberg,</HI> at <HI>Anneberg,</HI> and at <HI>Joachims Dale,</HI> 1526.</P>
<P>Having passed some time at <HI>Friberg,</HI> I ordered my Journey for <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and travelling by <HI>Waltheim</HI> and <HI>Col∣dick,</HI> came unto it.</P>
<P><HI>Leipsick</HI> is seated upon the River <HI>Elster,</HI> which arising in <HI>Vortland,</HI> or <HI>Terra Advocatorum,</HI> passeth by it, and afterwards runneth into the River <HI>Sala.</HI> It is a rich and great trading City; hath three <HI>Marts</HI> in the year, and great resort unto it from many parts: It is well-built, and divers <HI>Houses</HI> are seven stories high. The <HI>Castle</HI> is strictly guarded, and hath in it a strong white Town: But the Works about the Town are not very considerable, al∣though they might be made strong.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="82"/>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is well adorned, and hath the name to be the fairest within side of any <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church in <HI>Germany;</HI> they have also a remarkable <HI>Burial∣place</HI> or <HI>Godtsaker,</HI> walled about, and cloystered near the Wall, wherein the better sort are buried, as the rest in the middle and open part. Which put me in mind of that noble <HI>Burial-place</HI> which I saw at <HI>Pisa</HI> in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> called <HI>Il campo Santo,</HI> because the Earth which the Em∣perour <HI>Frederick Barbarossa</HI> brought from the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> for the Ballast of his Ships, was laid upon that Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Leipsick</HI> is famous for two great Battels fought near unto it in the last <HI>Swedish</HI> wars; one between <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> General of the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> 1631. wherein the <HI>Swedes</HI> obtained a great Victory. <HI>Tilly</HI> was wounded, fled, and lived not long after. Another some years after in the same place, wherein <HI>Leonard Torstenson</HI> the <HI>Swede,</HI> overcame Arch∣duke <HI>Leopoldus Gulielmus,</HI> and <HI>Octavio Piccolomini,</HI> Gene∣rals of the <HI>Imperial Army.</HI> And about a mile and a half from hence, at <HI>Lutzen,</HI> another great Battel was fought, 1632. between the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and the <HI>Imperial Ar∣my,</HI> commanded by <HI>Albert Wallensteyn</HI> Duke of <HI>Friedland,</HI> wherein the <HI>Swedes</HI> obtained the Victory, but the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was slain; and on the <HI>Imperial</HI> side that famous Commander, <HI>Godfrey</HI> Count of <HI>Pappenheim.</HI></P>
<P>There is also an <HI>University</HI> at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> first occasioned by the <HI>German</HI> Scholars of <HI>Prague,</HI> who in the troubles of the <HI>Hussites</HI> came hither, to the number of Two thou∣sand in one day; and is still one of the <HI>Three Universities</HI> in the Elector's Dominions; the other being <HI>Jena</HI> by the River <HI>Sala,</HI> and <HI>Wittenberg</HI> upon the <HI>Elbe.</HI> In this <HI>Uni∣versity</HI> they are much addicted to the study of the <HI>Law,</HI> but there are also Learned men in other Faculties.</P>
<PB N="140" REF="83"/>
<P>The Magistrates of <HI>Leipsick</HI> are also considerable. <HI>Der herr von Adlershelme</HI> was the <HI>Burgomaster,</HI> a courteous Learned Person, and great <HI>Virtuoso,</HI> who had collected and observed many things: He hath had five fair Daugh∣ters brought up in all commendable ways of working, <HI>Drawing, Painting, Inlaying</HI> with <HI>Flowers,</HI> with <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Pearl, Stones,</HI> and other pretty <HI>Works.</HI> And they speak divers <HI>Languages,</HI> which they learned at a School in <HI>Holland:</HI> So that his House hath a great deal of excel∣lent Furniture of his Childrens work, and is one of the most considerable Curiosities to be seen in <HI>Leipsick.</HI> His <HI>Summer-house</HI> is handsome, painted both within and with∣out: And in the Water about, are <HI>Muscovy Ducks, Indian Geese,</HI> and divers rare <HI>Fowls.</HI> In his <HI>Chamber</HI> of <HI>Rari∣ties</HI> there are many things considerable: But I have seen divers of them in other places, and lately set down some <HI>Varieties</HI> of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> I shall mention but a few.</P>
<P>An <HI>Elephants Head</HI> with the <HI>dentes molares</HI> in it. An <HI>Animal</HI> like an <HI>Armadillo,</HI> but the Scales are much larger, and the Tail broader.

<P>Leaving this busie and trading City of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> I di∣rected my Journey unto <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> and travelled through a plain Country, between the River <HI>Sala</HI> and the <HI>Elbe,</HI> by <HI>Landsberg,</HI> nigh to <HI>Petersdorff,</HI> where there is a small Hill which overlooks all the Country, so to <HI>Kihten,</HI> the Resi∣dence of the Prince of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> then to <HI>Caln,</HI> and over the River <HI>Sala,</HI> before it runneth into the <HI>Elbe,</HI> which arising at <HI>Mount Fichtelberg,</HI> now hastneth towards it. <HI>Fich∣telberg</HI> is a considerable Mountain, near which are divers <HI>Mines, Bathes,</HI> and <HI>Mineral-waters,</HI> of which <HI>Gaspar Bruschius</HI> hath written a Description. And from it arise four Rivers, running to the four quarters of the World. The <HI>Maine</HI> or <HI>Moenus,</HI> towards the West; the <HI>Nab</HI> or <HI>Nabus,</HI> towards the South; the <HI>Aeger</HI> towards the East; and the forementioned <HI>Sala</HI> towards the North. These four afterwards fall into the three greatest Rivers of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Elbe.</HI> Then to <HI>Sals</HI> or <HI>Saltz,</HI> a placed noted for Salt-springs, and that night to <HI>Magdeburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Parthenopolis,</HI> or <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> is seated by the River <HI>Elbe,</HI> formerly the Metropolitan City of <HI>Germany,</HI> now under the Marquiss of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> of very great Circuit, but little more than half built again, since it was sacked and burnt by <HI>Tilly,</HI> and Thirty six thousand persons put to the Sword and destroyed. I could not but observe the ruinous and destructive effects of the late wars in many
<PB N="142" REF="84"/> parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> but not in any so great and flourish∣ing a place as this: And a man might think, that after this great destruction of Houses and People, this place should not be able to stand a Siege; yet a few years after it was besieged by General <HI>Hatzfield,</HI> unto whom (<HI>Bannier</HI> the <HI>Swede</HI> not being able to relieve it) it was yielded. The <HI>Cathedral Church</HI> is very fair, and built like an <HI>English</HI> one, by the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the First, and his Empress <HI>Editha,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> woman, Daughter unto King <HI>Edmund,</HI> whose <HI>Effigies</HI> in Stone I saw in the Church, with nine∣teen Tuns of <HI>Gold</HI> by her which she gave thereto. And to say the truth, <HI>English</HI> mony hath done great things in <HI>Germany,</HI> for hereby, or with a good part thereof, this Church was built or endowed. <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Au∣stria,</HI> built the old <HI>Walls</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> with the ransome of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, whom he detained in his return through <HI>Austria</HI> from the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the First sent a great Sum of Mony unto the Emperour <HI>Adol∣phus,</HI> for the raising of Souldiers in <HI>Germany,</HI> which the Emperour employed in purchasing a great part of <HI>Misnia</HI> for himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches are handsome, and their Pul∣pits are extraordinary noble, and richly set off, as I ob∣served, through all <HI>Saxony, Norimberg.</HI> And where they are Masters of the Places, and have not their Chur∣ches only by permission; here they shewed me in the <HI>Cathedral Church</HI> of St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> the <HI>Statua's</HI> of the <HI>five wise Virgins</HI> smiling, and of the <HI>five foolish Virgins</HI> lament∣ing, which are very well expressed: They shewed me al∣so two odd Reliques, which they still kept as <HI>Rarities;</HI> that is, the <HI>Bason</HI> wherein <HI>Pilate</HI> washed his hands, when he declared himself free from the blood of our <HI>Saviour;</HI> and the <HI>Ladder</HI> whereon the <HI>Cock</HI> stood when he crowed after St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s denying of Christ.</P>

He told me also that <HI>Dureus</HI> lodged with him, who was employed by King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, to endeavour a reconciliation between the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and to unite them if possible. We were now in the Territory of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg, Fridericus Wilhelmus,</HI> Great Chamberlain of the Empire, who is in effect pos∣sessed of <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> and next unto the <HI>Austrian Family,</HI> is the most potent Prince in <HI>Germany,</HI> being able to raise great <HI>Armies,</HI> and his <HI>Dominions</HI> so large, that they are reckoned to extend two hundred <HI>German</HI> miles in length, from the further part of <HI>Prussia</HI> unto <HI>Cleve,</HI> but they lay not together, but interspersed with many other Princes
<PB N="144" REF="85"/> Countries: Howsoever, a Horse-man may so order his Journey, as to lye every night in one of the Electour's Towns, in travelling from one end of his Territories to another.</P>
<P>I had now left the <HI>pure German Language</HI> behind me, for at <HI>Magdeburg</HI> comes in another kind of <HI>German,</HI> called <HI>Plat-Deutch, Broad-Dutch, Nidersachsische,</HI> or the <HI>Lan∣guage of lower Saxony;</HI> a great <HI>Language,</HI> spoken in the North part of <HI>Germany:</HI> They speak it at <HI>Hamburg, Lubeck,</HI> and many great Cities: But they can converse with the other <HI>High-dutch,</HI> and with some difficulty also with the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> the one speaking in his <HI>Language,</HI> and the other replying in his.</P>
<P>At this City of <HI>Magdeburg</HI> was performed the first <HI>Turnament</HI> that was in <HI>Germany,</HI> which was opened in the year 635. by the Emperour <HI>Henry,</HI> Surnamed the <HI>Fow∣ler,</HI> who coming from the war of <HI>Hungary,</HI> exceedingly satisfied with the <HI>Nobility,</HI> would oblige them to exercise themselves in handling their <HI>Arms,</HI> and managing their <HI>Horses,</HI> and therefore instituted these <HI>Sports,</HI> whereby the <HI>Nobility</HI> was powerfully attracted to <HI>Valour</HI> and <HI>Gallan∣try,</HI> and induced to perfect and accomplish themselves in all kind of <HI>Chevalry.</HI> No new <HI>Nobility,</HI> no <HI>Bastard,</HI> no <HI>Usurper,</HI> none guilty of <HI>High Treason,</HI> no <HI>Oppressor</HI> of <HI>Widows</HI> and <HI>Orphans,</HI> none born of <HI>Parents</HI> whereof one was of <HI>base Extraction</HI> and <HI>Ignoble,</HI> no <HI>Heretique, Mur∣derer, Traytor,</HI> no <HI>Coward</HI> that had run away from the <HI>Battel,</HI> nor <HI>indiscreet Person</HI> that had given <HI>offence</HI> to <HI>La∣dies</HI> by <HI>word</HI> or <HI>deed,</HI> were admitted to this <HI>Honour,</HI> nor above <HI>One</HI> of the same <HI>Family</HI> at a time. <HI>Princes</HI> came into the <HI>Lists</HI> with <HI>four Squires</HI> a piece, <HI>Counts</HI> and <HI>Ba∣rons</HI> with <HI>three,</HI> a <HI>Knight</HI> with <HI>two,</HI> and a <HI>Gentleman</HI> with <HI>one.</HI></P>
<PB N="145" REF="85"/>
<P>The hour and place for the <HI>Turnament</HI> being appoint∣ed, he that had a desire to break a <HI>Lance</HI> there, came to the <HI>Presidents Lodgings</HI> to have his <HI>Name</HI> written down, which was done in the presence of three <HI>Heralds,</HI> to whom the <HI>Champion</HI> delivered his <HI>Helmet</HI> and <HI>Sword,</HI> and after he had been at Confession, presented himself in the <HI>Lists</HI> with one or more <HI>Squires,</HI> according to his quality. The <HI>Horses</HI> of the <HI>Combatants</HI> were to be without fault or exception; the <HI>Caparisons</HI> and <HI>Furniture</HI> such as gave no offence; their <HI>Saddles</HI> without any extraordinary ri∣sing before and behind, and all things equal. After which they performed all kind of <HI>Exercises</HI> on <HI>Horse-back:</HI> and after the <HI>Jousts</HI> were ended, every man repaired to the <HI>President</HI> of his <HI>Nation,</HI> to wait for the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>Judges;</HI> and he that best deserved the <HI>Prize,</HI> received it either from the <HI>hand</HI> of some <HI>Lady,</HI> or from the <HI>Prince</HI> that gave it.</P>
<P>These <HI>Pastimes</HI> were afterwards disused, upon the E∣mulation it caused between the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> who strove to outvie one another; or upon wars, in which there was no leisure for such <HI>Exercises;</HI> or perhaps upon con∣sideration that divers <HI>brave men</HI> lost their <HI>lives</HI> in these <HI>Encounters:</HI> And no less a <HI>Prince</HI> than <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, King of <HI>France,</HI> neglecting to wear his <HI>Beaver</HI> down, was slain in a <HI>Turnament.</HI> And at <HI>Darmstadt</HI> also, in the year 1403. at the Three and twentieth <HI>Turnament</HI> which was held in <HI>Germany,</HI> the Gentlemen of <HI>Franconia</HI> and those of <HI>Hesse,</HI> drew so much blood upon one another, that there remained dead upon the place seventeen of the for∣mer, and nine of the latter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Winter</HI> growing on called me to make haste to <HI>Hamburg,</HI> from whence I intended to pass by Sea into <HI>England,</HI> and therefore I took the advantage of the <HI>Stage-Coaches</HI> at <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> and in four days came to <HI>Ham∣burg;</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="86"/> I travelled through a Country for the most part barren, of little accommodation, or scarce any thing ve∣ry remarkable, through part of the Electour of <HI>Branden∣burg,</HI> and then through the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg</HI>'s Coun∣try, passing by the City of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> a handsome wal∣led City, beautified with divers fair <HI>Churches,</HI> with high <HI>Spires.</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> of St. <HI>Lambert,</HI> the <HI>Town-house,</HI> and the <HI>Duke</HI>'s <HI>Palace,</HI> are fair. Here are <HI>Salt-springs</HI> in the <HI>Town,</HI> very beneficial to the place, and supplying the <HI>neighbour Countries.</HI> The <HI>Town</HI> is commanded by a <HI>Hill</HI> near to it, called <HI>Kalkberg,</HI> which lieth on the North-side.</P>
<P>In this Road through <HI>lower Saxony,</HI> I could not but take notice of many <HI>Barrows</HI> or <HI>Mounts</HI> of <HI>Earth,</HI> the burial <HI>Monuments</HI> of great and famous <HI>Men,</HI> to be often observed also in open Countries in <HI>England,</HI> and some∣times rows of great <HI>Stones,</HI> like those in <HI>Wormius</HI> his <HI>Da∣nish Antiquities:</HI> And in one place I took more particu∣lar notice of them, where three massy <HI>Stones</HI> in the mid∣dle, were encompassed in a large square by other large <HI>Stones</HI> set up an end.</P>
<P><HI>Hamburg</HI> is a fair <HI>City,</HI> and one of the great ones in <HI>Ger∣many;</HI> it is seated in a <HI>Plain,</HI> being populous, rich, and remarkably strong: It is fortified <HI>a la Moderne,</HI> much after the way of <HI>Holland,</HI> with <HI>works</HI> of <HI>earth,</HI> but in no place yet <HI>Revestues,</HI> or faced with <HI>brick</HI> or <HI>stone:</HI> The <HI>Territory</HI> belonging to it is but small; it is divided into the <HI>new</HI> and the <HI>old Town.</HI> There are five <HI>Gates:</HI> The <HI>Stone gate,</HI> leading towards <HI>Lubeck;</HI> the <HI>Dome-gate;</HI> the <HI>Alten-gate,</HI> or which leadeth unto <HI>Altenaw,</HI> a place near the <HI>Town,</HI> belonging to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the <HI>Romanists</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> have their <HI>Churches;</HI> the <HI>Bridge-gate;</HI> and the <HI>Dike-gate.</HI> The <HI>Buildings</HI> of this City are handsome, and commonly have a fair entrance
<PB N="147" REF="86"/> into them. The <HI>Senate-house</HI> is noble, adorned with carved <HI>Statua's</HI> of the <HI>Nine Worthies.</HI> The <HI>Exchange</HI> or place of meeting for <HI>Merchants,</HI> was then enlarging, it being too small to receive those <HI>Numbers</HI> which frequen∣ted it. Many of their <HI>Churches</HI> are very fair, with high <HI>Steeples,</HI> covered with <HI>Copper.</HI> The Front of St. <HI>Kathe∣rines</HI> is beautiful. The <HI>Steeple</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is sup∣ported with great gilded <HI>Globes.</HI> The other great <HI>Churches,</HI> are the <HI>Dome-Church,</HI> St. <HI>Peters,</HI> St. <HI>Jacob.</HI> The greater and less, St. <HI>Michael,</HI> the <HI>New-Church</HI> in the <HI>New town.</HI> The lesser <HI>Churches,</HI> are St. <HI>Gertrude,</HI> St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> They have a <HI>Sermon</HI> every day, as in other <HI>Lutheran</HI> Cities.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Alster</HI> runs through it into the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and turneth many <HI>Mills:</HI> and the <HI>Tide</HI> comes up into divers Streets through <HI>Chanels,</HI> although it be distant eighteen <HI>German</HI> miles from the <HI>Sea,</HI> or Mouth of the <HI>Elbe.</HI> This place aboundeth with shipping, and many of good Bur∣den, and is well seated for <HI>Trade,</HI> as having an open <HI>pas∣sage</HI> into the <HI>Ocean,</HI> and being but a days Journey from the <HI>Lubeck</HI> on the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> and being seated upon the long River <HI>Elbe,</HI> the third great River of <HI>Germany,</HI> whereby it may have Commerce with a great part of that Country, and as far as <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hamburg</HI> is full of <HI>Strangers</HI> and <HI>Merchants</HI> of several Countries. The <HI>English Company</HI> have good <HI>Priviledges</HI> and a rich <HI>Trade,</HI> and <HI>Ships</HI> come laden thither with <HI>Cloath</HI> to the value of an hundred thousand pounds <HI>sterling;</HI> and they live here in good Reputation, and to the honour of their Country: they are <HI>Persons</HI> of <HI>worth, courtesie,</HI> and <HI>civility;</HI> and I heartily wish them all success in their <HI>Af∣fairs.</HI> I must not omit the acknowledgment of my par∣ticular Obligation to that <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>worthy Person,</HI> Mr. <HI>Griffin,</HI> Preacher unto the Company, Mr. <HI>Free</HI> the Trea∣surer,
<PB N="148" REF="87"/> Mr. <HI>Banks,</HI> who hath been in many places of <HI>Na∣tolia,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jenkinson,</HI> and my very obliging Friends Mr. <HI>Catelin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Townly.</HI></P>
<P>This place hath the happiness to be quiet when the great Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> are at war; for it desires to hold a strict <HI>Amity</HI> with Princes, and declines all <HI>Dissention</HI> with them.</P>
<P>I found a Ship at <HI>Hamburg</HI> bound for <HI>London,</HI> and while it was fitting for Sail, I made a short <HI>excursion</HI> into part of the King of <HI>Denmarks</HI> Country; and returning to <HI>Hamburg</HI> again, I ordered my affairs for <HI>England</HI> upon the first wind, and hoped the next <HI>Tide</HI> to get over the <HI>Altenaw sand,</HI> and to pass the <HI>Blanckness,</HI> but a cross wind prevented, so that I left not <HI>Hamburg</HI> till the tenth of <HI>December,</HI> and then I had the good Company of Mr. <HI>Hoyle,</HI> who came from <HI>Narva,</HI> and set Sail in a new Ship; but the days being at the shortest, and the nights dark in the <HI>New Moon,</HI> the <HI>Tide</HI> falling also in the day time, we were able to get no further the first day than <HI>Stadt,</HI> or <HI>Stoade,</HI> upon the River <HI>Zwingh,</HI> a strong <HI>Town,</HI> belonging to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where the Ships that come up the River pay Custome, and where the <HI>English</HI> Merchants had formerly their <HI>Residence,</HI> when they left <HI>Hamburg</HI> upon a Discontent.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the <HI>11th.</HI> we came by <HI>Gluckstadt,</HI> belonging to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the <HI>Castle,</HI> the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Palace,</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI> are handsome, and Anchored that night before the Mouth of the River <HI>Oast,</HI> which ariseth in <HI>Bremerland,</HI> and falleth into the <HI>Elbe</HI> a mile from <HI>Bruns∣büttel,</HI> on the other <HI>Holsatian</HI> shoar.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the <HI>12th.</HI> we lost sight of the Northern shoar, and passed <HI>Cook</HI>'s <HI>Haven,</HI> in full hopes to put out to Sea that night; but about Three in the Afternoon we were becalmed a League and a half below it, where we were
<PB N="149" REF="87"/> forced to come to an Anchor again, lest the strong <HI>Ebbe</HI> should set us on ground among the <HI>Sands:</HI> So we lay that night between <HI>Thicksand</HI> on the North, and <HI>Newark</HI> on the South, right over against a <HI>Light-house.</HI></P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the <HI>13th.</HI> the wind turning Westernly, and blowing hard, we returned to <HI>Cook</HI>'s <HI>Haven,</HI> and came to Anchor. Here I came a shoar, and went up the Land to the Fort in this place belonging to the City of <HI>Ham∣burg:</HI> It is a high square Work, with a double Ditch, and some <HI>Vessels</HI> come up to the Fort; but the <HI>Ditch</HI> or <HI>Chanel</HI> which comes thither out of the <HI>Elbe,</HI> is dry at low water. The <HI>Town</HI> is called <HI>Reutsbüttel,</HI> not far from the Lands end. Two or three days after, with a cold North-East-wind, we set Sail for <HI>England.</HI> Coming out of the <HI>Elbe,</HI> we were all the Afternoon in sight of an Island, cal∣led <HI>Heilige-landt,</HI> or <HI>Holy-land,</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> which being very high Land, is to be seen at a good distance, and is of excellent use to direct and guide Ships into the Mouth of the <HI>Elbe,</HI> without which they would be at a great loss, the Country about that Rivers Mouth being all very low Land.</P>
<P><HI>Heiligeland</HI> is a small <HI>Island,</HI> having about two thou∣sand <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> and six or seven small <HI>Vessels</HI> belonging to it, which are imployed a great part of the year in bring∣ing <HI>Lobsters</HI> and other <HI>Fish</HI> to <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Quinborough,</HI> the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> living most upon <HI>Fish.</HI> We bore out to Sea all night, and the next day made towards the Land again, and sailed in sight of <HI>Schiemoniekeoghe, Amelandt,</HI> and <HI>Schelling:</HI> in the Evening we saw the Lights at the <HI>Vly</HI> and <HI>Texel;</HI> when we were near the Land, we were much troubled with the Frost and cold Weather, and less when we were off at Sea. The next day we had a fair wind, and made such way, that in the Evening we took down our Sails, and let the <HI>Vessel</HI> drive, not being wil∣ling
<PB N="150" REF="88"/> to deal with the shoar in the night. The next morn∣ing we soon discovered the <HI>Northforeland</HI> covered with Snow, and came to an Anchor in <HI>Margarite</HI>-Road, where the wind growing very high, we rode it out for two days and two nights, and came safe on shoar (praised be God) upon <HI>Christmas-day</HI> morning.</P>
<P>Now having made so long a walk in <HI>Germany,</HI> I must confess I returned with a better opinion of the Country, than I had before of it; and cannot but think it very considerable in many things. The Rivers there∣of are noble, and seem to exceed those of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>I∣taly.</HI> Of the Rivers of <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Padus</HI> or <HI>Po,</HI> is the most considerable, which notwithstanding, hath no very long course, before it runneth into the <HI>Adriatick Sea.</HI> And <HI>Italy</HI> being divided by the <HI>Appennine-hills,</HI> running from West to East, the Rivers which arise from either side, cannot be long, neither on the South-side, before they run into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> as the <HI>Arno, Garigliano,</HI> and others: Nor on the North side, before they run into the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> or the <HI>Po.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Rivers of <HI>France,</HI> as the <HI>Loyre,</HI> the <HI>Seine,</HI> the <HI>Rhosne,</HI> and the <HI>Garonne,</HI> I cannot but highly com∣mend, having passed upon them for divers days. There are also four great Rivers in <HI>Germany;</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and the <HI>Oder,</HI> but none of <HI>France</HI> seem comparable unto the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Danube. France</HI> having the Sea upon the North, the West, and the two large Pro∣vinces of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Province</HI> upon the <HI>Mediterra∣nean Sea,</HI> hath the opportunity of Noble Cities and Sea∣ports: But some doubt may be made, Whether any there∣of do exceed <HI>Hamburg, Lubeck,</HI> and <HI>Dantzick.</HI></P>
<P>The great number of populous, large, and handsome Cities, doth afford great content unto a <HI>Traveller</HI> in <HI>Ger∣many;</HI> for besides about Sixty six free Imperial Cities,
<PB N="151" REF="88"/> are many more of good note belonging to particular Princes, and divers highly priviledged. And surely a true Estimation of the Cities and Towns of these days, cannot be duly made from the Accounts and Descripti∣ons thereof left an hundred years since or more, for since those times, Buildings have been better modelled and or∣dered; Fortifications and Out-works more regularly contrived; Convents and Publick Houses more neatly and commodiously built; and the fair Colledges and Churches of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> which are now to be seen in most, do much set off the Beauty of great Places. Every where we meet with great and populous <HI>Towns, Villages, Castles, Seats</HI> of the <HI>Nobility, Plains, Forests,</HI> and plea∣sant <HI>Woods.</HI> And besides the satisfaction we may have from Objects above ground, we may find no small con∣tent in the wonders thereof under it, in <HI>Mines, Minerals</HI> almost of all sorts, of <HI>Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tinn, Lead, Quicksilver, Antimony, Coal, Salt, Sulphur, Cad∣mia,</HI> and others, where there are also singular <HI>Artificers</HI> and <HI>Workmen,</HI> in the several Artifices thereof. Con∣versation with the People is easie, they behaving them∣selves without much Formality, and are plain-dealing and trusty, so that a <HI>Traveller</HI> needs not to be so so∣licitous and heedful of what he hath, as in some other Countries, which are esteemed of greater Civility. The Women are generally well-complexioned, sober, and grave, and they have not yet learned the custome of their Neighbours of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to admit of being saluted by Men: faithful to their Husbands, and careful in the affairs of their Houses.</P>
<P>They make good provision against the cold of their Country, by sleeping between two Feather-beds and Stoves.</P>
<PB N="152" REF="89"/>
<P>The common <HI>Stoves</HI> in <HI>Inns,</HI> wherein there are for the most part several Companies eating, drinking, and in the night sleeping, are convenient, considering the great cold, or at least tolerable; but they being rooms close shut up, the smell of the meat, and especially of <HI>Cabbage,</HI> an usual Dish amongst them, makes them un∣pleasant, so that sometimes I preferred the course of hot Countries, while I called to mind, that in <HI>Pro∣vince</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> we drank frozen <HI>Julebs,</HI> which we dis∣solved with the heat of our hands; slept upon a sheet, on the outside of the Bed, with all the Windows of the Chamber open; and as we sate at dinner, there was a Fann in the middle of the Room, hanging over our Heads, about two yards broad, which with a string was pulled backward and forward to cool us, and divers had Pans filled with Snow, to cool the sheets when they went into their Beds.</P>
<P><HI>Germany</HI> is a great <HI>Hive</HI> of men, and the mighty de∣struction of men made by the last <HI>German</HI> wars, and by the Plague is so repaired, that it is scarce discernible. They are fruitful, and full of Children: They are not exhausted by <HI>Sea,</HI> Colonies sent forth, or by peopling <HI>A∣merican Countries;</HI> but they have some consumption by wars abroad, when they be at peace at home: few wars being made in other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein there are not some Regiments of <HI>Germans;</HI> the People being na∣turally Martial, and persons well descended, very averse from a Trading course of Life.</P>
<P>While I read in <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the old barbarous and rude State of <HI>Germany,</HI> how poorly they lived, that they had their Houses at a distance from one another; how igno∣rant they were in Arts; and it was doubted whether their Country afforded <HI>Mines;</HI> that they lived by exchange of things, making little or no use of mony, and the like,
<PB N="153" REF="89"/> I may justly wonder to behold the present advance and improvement in all commendable Arts, Learning, Civili∣ty, splendid and handsome Cities and Habitations, and the general face of things incredibly altered since those ancient times; and cannot but approve the expression of a Learned Man, though long since, <HI>That if</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stus, Civilis, <HI>and those old famous men of</HI> Germany, <HI>should re∣vive in their Country again, and look up to Heaven behold∣ing the Constellations of the Bears and other Stars, they might probably acknowledge that these were the same Stars which they were wont to behold; but if they should look downward, and well view the face of all things, they would imagine themselves to be in a new world, and never acknowledge this to have been their Country.</HI></P>

Hence these <HI>Thermae</HI> from their Discoverer have been named <HI>Aquae Graniae,</HI> and came to be frequented; and the <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Aquisgrane</HI> built and flourished, till <HI>Attila,</HI> the King of the <HI>Huns,</HI> or <HI>Hungarians,</HI> destroyed it.</P>
<P>About four hundred years after, <HI>Charles</HI> the Great ri∣ding out a <HI>hunting</HI> in these parts, as he passed through the <HI>Woods,</HI> his Horses Foot strook into one of these <HI>Hot∣springs;</HI> near which he also took notice of the <HI>Ruins</HI> of <HI>ancient Palaces</HI> and <HI>Buildings</HI> long before forsaken; and being still more and more delighted with the pleasant Si∣tuation of the place, and conveniency of these hot <HI>Ri∣volets,</HI> he renewed and adorned the <HI>Baths,</HI> built his <HI>Royal Palace</HI> near them: and appointed that the King of
<PB N="157" REF="91"/> the <HI>Romans</HI> should be crowned with an <HI>Iron Crown</HI> here as with a <HI>Silver</HI> one at <HI>Milan,</HI> and a <HI>Gold</HI> one at <HI>Rome.</HI> He also built a noble <HI>Collegiate Church,</HI> dedicated to the <HI>blessed Virgin,</HI> in the presence of many <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Bi∣shops,</HI> in the year 804, and endowed it with <HI>Revenues</HI> for the maintainance of <HI>Canons,</HI> who lived together in a <HI>Colledge</HI> at first, but at present separately in the manner of <HI>Prebends.</HI> He built also the <HI>old</HI> or <HI>inward Wall</HI> of the <HI>City,</HI> so that it flourished till the year 882. at which time it was again ruined by the Fury of the <HI>Normans,</HI> and the <HI>Emperours Palace</HI> burnt to the ground. This <HI>Ci∣ty,</HI> besides these Devastations from the Irruptions of the <HI>Huns</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> hath been divers times since de∣stroyed by <HI>Fire;</HI> as in the year 1146. which loss it overcame in such manner, that Twenty six years after, it recovered not only its former greatness, but was so much increased, that the large <HI>outward Wall</HI> was built by the command of the <HI>Emperour Frederick</HI> the First.</P>
<P>In the year 1224. happened another great <HI>Fire,</HI> in which, not only the <HI>Buildings,</HI> but many of the <HI>Inha∣bitants</HI> perished. And the <HI>Roof</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> was burnt in another <HI>Fire</HI> 1236. And now of late, for it is not long since it hath recovered its losses by the <HI>Fire</HI> in the year 1656. when twenty <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Chappels,</HI> and about five thousand private <HI>Houses</HI> were destroyed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Town-house,</HI> or <HI>Senate-house,</HI> was built 1353. being all of <HI>Free-stone,</HI> handsomely adorned with the <HI>Statues</HI> of the <HI>Emperours.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second Story</HI> of this <HI>Building</HI> is divided into <HI>Chambers;</HI> but the highest is all one entire <HI>Room</HI> or <HI>Hall,</HI> 162 Foot long, and 60 Foot broad. It is well <HI>painted</HI> in divers parts by <HI>Ami∣saga:</HI> Two Pieces of whose <HI>drawing</HI> are much esteemed here; one of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and another of <HI>Charles</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="92"/> the Great, giving the <HI>Charter</HI> to the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Aken.</HI> Here the <HI>Emperours,</HI> at the time of their <HI>Coronation,</HI> used to keep their <HI>Feasts,</HI> together with the <HI>Electours</HI> and other <HI>Princes.</HI> The <HI>Roof</HI> is supported by <HI>four Pillars;</HI> through the middle of which, the <HI>smoak</HI> of all the <HI>Chimneys</HI> of this <HI>Building,</HI> is by a handsome contrivance conveyed away.</P>
<P>Over against this <HI>House,</HI> in the middle of the <HI>Piazza,</HI> is a <HI>Fountain,</HI> considerable both for <HI>largeness</HI> and neat <HI>structure,</HI> contrived by a great <HI>Artist, Gerard Coris:</HI> where four <HI>Springs</HI> perpetually empty themselves from above into a large <HI>Bason</HI> of <HI>Copper,</HI> of thirty Foot <HI>Dia∣meter;</HI> from whence again it descends by six <HI>Pipes</HI> into a <HI>Cistern</HI> of <HI>Stone,</HI> handsomely engraved, and passeth to many other <HI>Fountains</HI> in the <HI>Town.</HI> On the top of this <HI>Fountain</HI> stands a large <HI>Statue</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, <HI>Patron</HI> of this <HI>City,</HI> made of <HI>brass,</HI> and gilded over. He is in <HI>Armour,</HI> and looketh towards <HI>Germany.</HI> About the edges of the great <HI>brass Bason</HI> is this <HI>Inscription:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hic aquis per</HI> Granum <HI>Principem quendam</HI> Romanum, Neronis <HI>&amp;</HI> Agrippae <HI>fratrem inventis, calidorum fontium</HI> Thermae <HI>à Principio constructae.

P. Q.</HI> Aquisgranensis, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1620.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> of our <HI>Lady,</HI> built by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, is of an odd <HI>Figure.</HI> At the West-end is a <HI>Steeple</HI> adorned with divers <HI>Pyramids;</HI> and on the top a large <HI>Globe</HI> and <HI>Cross.</HI> From hence, higher much than the <HI>Church,</HI> passeth a <HI>Gallery,</HI> supported by a large <HI>Arch</HI> to a <HI>Cupola</HI> near the
<PB N="159" REF="92"/> middle of the <HI>Church.</HI> At the East-end is also a small <HI>Turret</HI> or <HI>Lanthorn.</HI> The inside of the whole is adorned with <HI>Marble Pillars</HI> of divers sorts, with <HI>Pillars</HI> of <HI>brass,</HI> gilded <HI>Statues, brass Doors</HI> and <HI>Partitions,</HI> and much <HI>Mosaick</HI> work.</P>
<P>In the middle of the <HI>Church,</HI> where <HI>Charles</HI> the Great was buried, hangeth a very large <HI>Crown,</HI> given to this Church by the Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> the First. This <HI>Crown</HI> is made of <HI>silver</HI> and <HI>brass</HI> gilt, adorned with sixteen little <HI>Towers,</HI> and eight and forty <HI>Statues</HI> of <HI>silver,</HI> of about a Foot high, and thirty two which are lesser. Be∣tween these stand eight and forty <HI>Candlesticks</HI> to receive the <HI>Lights</HI> burnt here upon <HI>Festivals.</HI></P>
<P>Of these large <HI>Crowns</HI> I have seen at <HI>Colen,</HI> and other parts; and it hath been an ancient Ornament in <HI>Churches.</HI> The <HI>Greeks</HI> have a <HI>Crown,</HI> or large <HI>Circle</HI> much like this, in the middle of most of their best <HI>Churches;</HI> on which they hang many <HI>Ostrich</HI> Eggs, and the <HI>Pictures</HI> of the <HI>A∣postles</HI> and <HI>Saints.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> do likewise imitate it in their <HI>Mosques,</HI> but instead of <HI>Pictures</HI> place Lamps.</P>
<P><HI>Frederick</HI> the First took up the <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great out of its <HI>Sepulchre</HI> in the middle of the <HI>Church,</HI> and afterwards buried it again; partly in a <HI>silver Coffin</HI> under the <HI>Altar</HI> of the <HI>Quire,</HI> and partly near the <HI>Wall</HI> of the <HI>old Building,</HI> covering it with the same <HI>Tomb-stone,</HI> as before; which is here reported to have been first ta∣ken from the <HI>Tomb</HI> of <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI> It is of <HI>white Mar∣ble,</HI> and hath the <HI>Figure</HI> of <HI>Proserpina</HI> upon it. Out of this <HI>Tomb</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, were taken up a great number of <HI>Reliques</HI> and considerable <HI>Rarities,</HI> which he had got together in his life time; some of them given him by <HI>Aaron</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> by the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> and others; divers of which are still preserved here: and these following we had the opportunity to see.
<PB N="160" REF="93"/> Some of the blessed <HI>Virgins hair.</HI> One <HI>ring</HI> or <HI>link</HI> of the <HI>Chain</HI> with which St. <HI>Peter</HI> was chained in <HI>Prison.</HI> The <HI>Head</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great.

A piece of the true <HI>Manna.</HI> Some of the <HI>Bones</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> richly enchased, upon which the Emperours are sworn at their <HI>Inauguration.</HI> A piece of one of the <HI>Nails</HI> of the <HI>Cross.</HI> An <HI>Agnus Dei</HI> sent from the <HI>Pope</HI> to <HI>Charles</HI> the Great; and many other <HI>Reliques.</HI> Here is al∣so the <HI>Tomb</HI> of the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the Third, in <HI>black Marble,</HI> who in the year 1000, first constituted the Ele∣ctors of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Near to this <HI>City</HI> are many sorts of <HI>Minerals</HI> found; as <HI>Lead ore,</HI> the <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and <HI>Vitriol-stone, Iron, Coal,</HI> and <HI>Cadmia,</HI> or <HI>Lapis Calaminaris:</HI> With this latter we saw them make <HI>Brass,</HI> or multiply <HI>Copper,</HI> in this manner. They take calcined <HI>Cadmia,</HI> or <HI>Calmey,</HI> as they call it, <HI>Copper</HI> from <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the melted dross of both; to twenty eight pounds of <HI>Copper</HI> they put an hundred pound of <HI>Calmey:</HI> They put first into very large <HI>Crucibles,</HI> some old pieces of <HI>brass</HI> and <HI>slacken,</HI> or the dross, and after∣wards the <HI>Calmey</HI> and <HI>Copper,</HI> and let them stand in the Furnace twelve hours; after which, they put eight <HI>Cru∣cibles</HI> full into one, and let what will run over, the best sinking always to the bottom; and then cast it into a Frame made of stone, bordered with bars of Iron; and
<PB N="161" REF="93"/> so run it into brass Plates, which are afterwards cut in pie∣ces with large <HI>Cissars.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>hot Bathes</HI> are very much frequented at present. Within the inward Walls are three convenient ones: The <HI>Emperours Bath,</HI> the <HI>Little Bath,</HI> and the <HI>Bath</HI> of S. <HI>Qui∣rinus.</HI> The <HI>Emperours Bath</HI> is in the same place, and fed with the same Springs with that in which formerly <HI>Charles</HI> the Great took so much delight, that he frequently used to swim therein; in which Exercise few were more ex∣pert than himself; and spent the latter end of his days here, and would often invite to the <HI>Bath,</HI> not only his Sons, but his Nobles, his Friend and Guards; so as it was customary to Bathe a hundred together in those days. But now they are divided into lesser Partitions. The <HI>Emperours Bath</HI> having five Bathing Rooms; and the <HI>Lit∣tle Bath</HI> which cometh out of it three. These are reckoned to be <HI>Nitro-Sulphureus;</HI> and arise so hot, that they let them cool twelve hours before they use them. From un∣der a great round Stone which covered a Well, in which there were some of these <HI>Hot Springs,</HI> I saw <HI>Brimstone,</HI> hard, above an inch thick, and <HI>Salt-peter,</HI> and a petri∣fied Substance finely variegated, taken out.</P>
<P>Besides these, near unto the inward Wall of the City, there are <HI>Baths</HI> which are not so hot as the former, esteem∣ed to be <HI>Sulphureo-nitrous:</HI> The smell of them is some∣what offensive, and the water in the <HI>Cisterns</HI> not transpa∣rent. The first is the <HI>Bath</HI> of St. <HI>Cornelius,</HI> which hath two Receptacles. The second, the <HI>Rose Bath,</HI> so cal∣led from Mr. <HI>Rose,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>Aken,</HI> who built it. The third, <HI>Compus Badt,</HI> or the <HI>Poor man's Bath.</HI> Of this sort of warm Water there is also a <HI>Fountain,</HI> much resorted to, and drank of every morning in the <HI>Summer</HI> for many <HI>Chro∣nical Diseases.</HI> About a Furlong out of the South-gate of <HI>Aken,</HI> is a Village called <HI>Porcetum,</HI> or <HI>Borset,</HI> from the
<PB N="162" REF="94"/> great number of wild <HI>Hoggs,</HI> which formerly frequented that place; in which are many <HI>Hot Springs</HI> upon both sides of a little <HI>Rivolet,</HI> and let into <HI>Houses,</HI> where they are distributed into several <HI>Baths</HI> of <HI>Stone.</HI> There are fourteen of these <HI>Houses,</HI> and twenty eight <HI>Baths;</HI> the <HI>Baths</HI> holding ordinarily about fifty Tuns of Water, each of them: the Water is clear and pleasant, without any offensive smell; excessive hot when it cometh first out of the Ground, hotter than the hottest of <HI>Aken,</HI> and is left to cool about eighteen hours before they use it. They use also an Instrument of Wood, pierced with many holes, to help to cool them sooner, or to stir the Water when any one goeth in, whereby he is not so sensible of the heat. There are many cold <HI>Springs</HI> rise near these hot ones, whereby they might be tempered; and surely the quantity of the hot Water being so great, no place might be made more delightful, nor no <HI>Baths</HI> more noble. The <HI>Turks</HI> in our times, do most of any Nation beautifie their <HI>Baths,</HI> and render them serviceable to their health and pleasure.</P>
<P>In <HI>Austria</HI> at <HI>Baden,</HI> the <HI>Sawer Bath</HI> is built after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner, with a <HI>Cupola</HI> over it: and if any one hereafter shall build or beautifie these, they will yield to very few in <HI>Europe.</HI> At present most of them are of a square Figure, of about five or six yards over; and the Houses in which they are, very near one another. The first House hath the name of the <HI>Ladies Bath;</HI> the second is the <HI>Snake;</HI> the third and fourth the <HI>Sword;</HI> the fifth the <HI>Golden Mill;</HI> the sixth the <HI>Fool;</HI> the seventh the <HI>Cock;</HI> the eighth the <HI>Great Bath;</HI> the ninth the <HI>Fountain;</HI> the tenth the <HI>Crab;</HI> the eleventh the <HI>World Inverted;</HI> the twelfth the <HI>Glass;</HI> the thirteenth the <HI>Angel;</HI> and the fourteenth the <HI>Rose.</HI> There is also another in the open Air, called the <HI>Poor man's Bath.</HI> In the Street is a <HI>Well</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="94"/> or <HI>Fountain</HI> of these <HI>Hot-springs,</HI> of as great a heat as any I have seen; perpetually boyling or bubling. But of all these <HI>Baths</HI> Dr. <HI>Blondel</HI> and Dr. <HI>Didier</HI> have writ∣ten so particularly, as I need not to add any thing more, and particularly of their Uses.</P>
<P>Within two Leagues of <HI>Aken,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Lim∣bourg,</HI> is a <HI>Mine</HI> of <HI>Lapis Calaminaris,</HI> which we went to see, having a <HI>Corporal</HI> and eight <HI>Musquetiers</HI> for our Security to pass the <HI>Wood.</HI> This <HI>Mine</HI> heth over a∣gainst the Castle of <HI>Einenberg.</HI> As soon as I had delive∣red a <HI>Letter</HI> to Mr. <HI>John Franck,</HI> Comptroller of the <HI>Mine</HI> for his <HI>Catholick Majesty,</HI> he went along with us, to shew us the manner how the <HI>Cadmia</HI> groweth in the Earth, and other Curiosities. This <HI>Mine</HI> having been wrought Three hundred years, and being one of the most remarkable of that kind, it may not be impertinent to set down some particulars concerning it. It is about eighteen or nineteen <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep, lying all open like a <HI>Chalk Mine,</HI> of an Oval Figure; they digg at present in several places, and the best <HI>Calmey</HI> lieth between the <HI>Rocks,</HI> in the deepest part of the <HI>Mine:</HI> They have now found an excellent <HI>Veyn</HI> so placed, of eleven or twelve Foot thick, which they digg out with <HI>Pickaxes,</HI> with some difficulty, by reason that the <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> is so very hard. The <HI>colour</HI> of this <HI>Stone</HI> is of a dark <HI>yellow</HI> and <HI>red,</HI> and hath <HI>Veyns</HI> of <HI>natural Brimstone</HI> mixed thin∣ly in it. The <HI>Veyns</HI> of the <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> being so large, they follow them not only in one place, but digg over one anothers heads, and frame their work into the shape of large <HI>Stayrs,</HI> and one throws up what another diggs, and so upward till they lade the <HI>Carts</HI> with it. Some of the <HI>Cadmia</HI> is blackish and dark brown; and there are <HI>Fluores</HI> between the Cavities of the <HI>Stone</HI> hand∣somely figured, but most of a <HI>blackish colour.</HI> The <HI>works</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="95"/> about the <HI>Mine</HI> the most remarkable, are these: 1. An <HI>Overshot-wheel</HI> in the Earth, which moves the <HI>Pumps</HI> to pump out the <HI>water;</HI> and this not placed in the <HI>Mine,</HI> but on one side of it, and a <HI>passage</HI> cut out of the <HI>Mine</HI> to the bottom of it, by which the <HI>Mine</HI> is drained; and another <HI>passage</HI> or <HI>cuniculus,</HI> out of the place where the <HI>wheel</HI> is turned, which lets out the <HI>water</HI> which turns the <HI>wheel,</HI> and also the <HI>water</HI> which cometh out of the <HI>Mine</HI> into the Neighbouring <HI>Valley.</HI> 2. The <HI>washing</HI> of the <HI>Ore</HI> or <HI>Stone,</HI> which they perform, as at other works, by letting the <HI>water</HI> over it, and stirring it; and this they do wheresoever they begin to work near the <HI>Superficies</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> for there the <HI>Calmey</HI> is less, and more mixed with <HI>Clay</HI> and <HI>Earth:</HI> but the most remarkable <HI>work</HI> is the <HI>calcining</HI> of the <HI>Ore</HI> (for all our <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> of the <HI>Shops</HI> is the <HI>calcined Calmey</HI>) and it is worth the see∣ing; for they place <HI>Faggots</HI> in a handsome order first, and cover a large round <HI>Area</HI> with them, of about For∣ty or Fifty yards <HI>Diameter,</HI> upon which they place <HI>Char∣coal</HI> in as good an order, till all be covered and filled up a yard from the ground; then they place ranks of the largest <HI>Stones</HI> of <HI>Calmey,</HI> and after them smaller, till they have laid all on; and then by setting <HI>fire</HI> to the <HI>bottom,</HI> the <HI>fire</HI> comes to each <HI>stone,</HI> and all is handsomely <HI>calci∣ned.</HI> From hence we went to <HI>Limburg,</HI> meeting with di∣vers <HI>Souldiers</HI> upon the <HI>Road,</HI> who desired mony of us, but did not attempt any thing against us, we being many of us together in Company.</P>
<P><HI>Limburg</HI> is seated upon a high <HI>Rock,</HI> which overlooks all the Country, and a little <HI>River</HI> runneth almost round it at the <HI>bottom.</HI> The <HI>Avenue</HI> to the <HI>Town</HI> on the North∣side is difficult all along upon the edge of the <HI>Rock;</HI> and the <HI>Gate</HI> of the <HI>Town,</HI> over which is the <HI>Governour's House,</HI> spreads it self from one side of the <HI>Rock</HI> to the
<PB N="165" REF="95"/> other, and locketh up the <HI>passage.</HI> Here we shew our <HI>Pasports</HI> from the <HI>Spanish</HI> Plenipotentiaries; and in the Afternoon had a pleasant Journey to the <HI>Spaa.</HI> In the way we saw where the <HI>French</HI> Army had passed the Country towards <HI>Metz,</HI> having lain about a Fortnight at <HI>Vichet,</HI> after the taking of <HI>Maestreicht.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spà</HI> is a neat <HI>Villedge</HI> in the <HI>Forest</HI> of <HI>Ardenna,</HI> seated in a <HI>bottom,</HI> encompassed on all sides with <HI>Hills,</HI> and on the North with steep <HI>Mountains.</HI> So that it happening to <HI>rain</HI> while we were there, the place was, in some hours time, filled with <HI>water,</HI> the <HI>Hay</HI> washed out of the <HI>Mea∣dows,</HI> the <HI>falls</HI> in the <HI>River</HI> made even, and <HI>Pohunt,</HI> one of the <HI>Mineral Fountains,</HI> was drowned. There was not much Company when we were there, although it were in the hottest time of the year, which is most seasonable for drinking the <HI>waters;</HI> by reason of the wars, and the danger of coming through the Country to them. But in <HI>Spà</HI> it self all people are free from <HI>danger,</HI> all the Neigh∣bouring <HI>Princes</HI> protecting it, and would count it very dishonourable to disturb a place, which by the <HI>virtue</HI> of its <HI>Mineral Springs,</HI> is so beneficial to <HI>Mankind.</HI> These <HI>Waters</HI> are not only drunk upon the place, but are also sealed up in <HI>Bottles,</HI> and sent into many parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Coquelet,</HI> at whose <HI>House</HI> we lodged, told me that he sent it as far as <HI>Saragossa</HI> in <HI>Spain:</HI> and that he had at that time Thirty thousand <HI>Bottles</HI> empty, and waited for a good season to fill them, which is the <HI>hottest, dry∣est</HI> time of the <HI>Summer,</HI> and the <HI>hardest Frost</HI> in <HI>Winter;</HI> at which times the <HI>water</HI> is <HI>strongest, sparkling,</HI> and <HI>brisk,</HI> The chiefest of these <HI>Mineral Fountains</HI> are these, <HI>Geron∣ster, Saviniere, Tonnelet,</HI> and <HI>Pohunt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Geronster</HI> is in the middle of a thick <HI>Wood,</HI> about an <HI>English</HI> mile and a half Southward of the <HI>Spà;</HI> it is the strongest of any, and the best adorned, being built up
<PB N="166" REF="96"/> with <HI>stone,</HI> and a <HI>Pavilion</HI> over it, supported with four handsome <HI>stone Pillars.</HI> There is a green place cleared in the <HI>Wood</HI> near to it, and a little <HI>House</HI> for the <HI>Patients</HI> to warm themselves in early, in the <HI>morning,</HI> or in <HI>cold wea∣ther.</HI> The <HI>Arms</HI> of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Conrad Bourgsdorff,</HI> who adorn∣ed this <HI>Fountain,</HI> are placed over, on two sides; and on the other two this <HI>Inscription</HI> in <HI>French</HI> and <HI>High-dutch,</HI> in a handsome <HI>Oval.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Le Reverendissime &amp; Excellentissime S<SUP>r</SUP> S<SUP>r</SUP></HI> Conrade Bourgsdorff, <HI>Grand Chamberlan, &amp; premier Conseiller d'Estat, Colonel &amp; Gouverneur General de tous les Forts &amp; Forteresses du Serenissime Electeur de</HI> Brandebourg <HI>dans son Estat Electoral, Grand Prevost des Eglises Cathedrales</HI> d'Halberstadt &amp; Brandebourg, <HI>Chevalier de l'Ordre de St.</HI> Jean, <HI>&amp; Commandeur du Baillage de</HI> Lagow, <HI>de gros</HI> Machenau, Golbeck, Bouckow, Oberstorff, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Fountain</HI> smelleth very strong of <HI>Brimstone,</HI> and causeth <HI>vomiting</HI> in a great many, yet passeth chiefly by <HI>Urine,</HI> as they do all; and strikes a <HI>purple</HI> with <HI>Nut∣galls</HI> more inclining to <HI>red,</HI> than the <HI>waters</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> The <HI>Sediment</HI> is of a <HI>light blew</HI> in the <HI>Fountain,</HI> but of a <HI>dark dirty red</HI> every where else. Not far from this is a∣nother large <HI>Spring</HI> in the <HI>Wood</HI> much like it, but not as yet built and beautified.</P>
<P><HI>Saviniere</HI> is another <HI>Fountain,</HI> almost as far from the <HI>Spà</HI> Eastward, and built after the manner of a <HI>Tower:</HI> the <HI>Acidulae</HI> are not so strong as the former.

<P>The third is <HI>Tonnelet,</HI> arising in the <HI>Meadow,</HI> and built up with <HI>stone:</HI> But being there are no <HI>Trees</HI> nor <HI>Shades</HI> a∣bout it, it is not so delightful as the others. And <HI>Hen∣ricus ab Heers</HI> in his <HI>Spadacrene,</HI> saith that this is more <HI>ni∣trous</HI> than the rest, and causeth such a coldness in the <HI>mouth</HI> and <HI>stomach,</HI> that few can drink of it.</P>
<P>The fourth is <HI>Pohunt,</HI> in the middle of the <HI>Town,</HI> from whence most of the <HI>water</HI> is drawn which is sent abroad, if no particular one be sent for. This was beautified with handsome <HI>Stone-work,</HI> by the Bishop of <HI>Liege,</HI> to whom this place belongeth, and this <HI>Inscription</HI> set over it, <HI>Sa∣nitati Sacrum.</HI> It is also called the <HI>Fountain of St. Remaclus,</HI> to whom it was dedicated; and these <HI>Verses</HI> are likewise engraven upon it:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Obstructum reserat, durum terit, humida siccat</HI></L>
<L><HI>Debile fortificat, si tamen arte bibis.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P><HI>i. e.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>This opens all Obstructions,</L>
<L>And wears away hard Tumours;</L>
<L>This strengthneth much the weaker parts,</L>
<L>And dries up cold moist Humours.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Being at the <HI>Spà,</HI> we visited <HI>Franchimont</HI> one After∣noon, passing through a thick <HI>Wood,</HI> there is an old Ca∣stle, and good <HI>Brimstone</HI> and <HI>Vitriol-works,</HI> the same <HI>Stone</HI> affording both; and I presume may also make the <HI>Spa-water</HI> under ground, or at least be a principal <HI>In∣gredient</HI> in it. We saw the manner here how they mel∣ted, and cast their <HI>Brimstone</HI> first into great <HI>Pails,</HI> the florid and clear parts remaining at the top and middle, the thick and more obscure subsiding and adhering to the
<PB N="168" REF="97"/> bottom and sides, and is that which is sold for <HI>Sulphur Vivum.</HI> We saw also the manner of casting the <HI>Brim∣stone</HI> into <HI>Rolls,</HI> or <HI>Magdaleons:</HI> And near unto this place a smoaking, burning, little <HI>Hill,</HI> which is thus caused: They throw out the burnt <HI>Pyrites,</HI> out of which <HI>Brimstone</HI> hath been distilled, and the <HI>Vitriol</HI> drawn out by infusion, upon this <HI>Hill,</HI> which consists all of the same matter, which ferments in time, grows hot, smoaks, and burns perpetually, and withal, drinks in a new <HI>Vitriol</HI> into its self.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Spà</HI> we crossed over to <HI>Frapont,</HI> a <HI>Village</HI> seated upon the pleasant River <HI>Uta,</HI> or <HI>Ourte,</HI> where we took Boat and went down a rapid <HI>Stream,</HI> yet one of the pleasantest I ever saw, winding and turning between so many green Hills, in part of the <HI>Forest</HI> of <HI>Arduenna.</HI> We descended afterwards thirty or forty small Falls in a long Boat made on purpose. The <HI>Oar</HI> or <HI>Paddle</HI> being only a square piece of <HI>Board</HI> fixed to the end of a <HI>Pole,</HI> the <HI>Pole</HI> standing perpendicularly in the middle of it. The delightful River <HI>Vesa,</HI> or the <HI>Wesdret,</HI> soon met us, and joyning together, we fell down with them into the <HI>Maes</HI> near <HI>Liege.</HI> Upon the Banks of these Rivers all the <HI>Arms, Guns,</HI> and other <HI>Instruments</HI> are made, for which the Country of <HI>Liege</HI> is remarkable.</P>
<P><HI>Liege, Luick, Leodium,</HI> or <HI>Augusta Eburonum;</HI> Learned Men think this City to be seated near that <HI>Val∣ley,</HI> wherein two Legions of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> under <HI>Sabi∣nus</HI> and <HI>Cotta,</HI> were destroyed by <HI>Ambiorix,</HI> chief Com∣mander of the <HI>Eburones.</HI> It is seated upon the River <HI>Mosa,</HI> which entring with two <HI>Streams,</HI> makes some pretty <HI>Islands.</HI> Three other small Rivers arising in the <HI>Forest</HI> of <HI>Ardenna,</HI> are also here received into the <HI>Maes,</HI> whereby they have plenty of Fish and other Conveniencies. The City is very populous, and so it
<PB N="169" REF="97"/> hath been in former Ages, when as <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Pur∣gunay,</HI> sacked it, and destroyed an hundred thousand of the people.</P>
<P>It aboundeth with fair <HI>Churches,</HI> stately <HI>Convents,</HI> and <HI>Religious</HI> Foundations, richly endowed, so that it hath been called the <HI>Paradise of Priests,</HI> and is in that kind the most notable in all these parts. The Palace of the Bishop is a noble Fabrick, built by Cardinal <HI>Erardus,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Liege.</HI> The <HI>Cathedral</HI> beareth the Name of St. <HI>Lambert,</HI> who being Bishop of <HI>Maestreicht</HI> was murder∣ed by <HI>Dodo</HI> and others, about the year 622. The See was afterwards translated unto <HI>Liege</HI> by <HI>Hubertus,</HI> as it had been formerly from <HI>Tongres</HI> to <HI>Maestreicht,</HI> and the Bo∣dy of St. <HI>Lambert</HI> removed unto this Church, which is at present very noble, being built of a reddish Stone, very much carved without, and handsomely adorned within. Between the <HI>Quire</HI> and <HI>Sacristy,</HI> is this <HI>Inscrip∣tion</HI> in very large <HI>Letters:</HI></P>
<Q><P>D. O. M.</P>
<P><HI>Intemeratae Virgini</HI> Mariae, <HI>Sancto</HI> Lamberto, <HI>Eccle∣siae &amp; Patriae Divis Tutelaribus,</HI> Maximilianus Henricus <HI>utriusque</HI> Bavariae <HI>Dux, Archiepiscopus &amp; Elector</HI> Colo∣niensis, <HI>Episcopus &amp; Princeps</HI> Leodiensis, Ernesti <HI>&amp;</HI> Fer∣dinandi Bavariae <HI>Ducum, Episcoporum &amp; Principum</HI> Leodi∣ensium <HI>Nepos &amp; Successor in sui &amp; Praedecessorum memori∣am Ponebat.</HI> MDCLVIII.</P></Q>
<P>The Canons hereof are of great riches and power, and have the Election of the Bishop and Prince, who hath also had the Titles of Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Fran∣chimont,</HI> and Count of <HI>Lootz</HI> and <HI>Hasbania.</HI> In the
<PB N="170" REF="98"/> Coin of <HI>Maximilian,</HI> the present Elector of <HI>Colen</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Liege,</HI> I find this Inscription:</P>
<P>Maximilianus Henricus <HI>Dei gratiâ Archiepiscopus</HI> Colo∣niensis, <HI>Episcopus &amp; Princeps</HI> Leodiensis, <HI>Supremus</HI> Bul∣lonensis <HI>Dux.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Speutus</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Liege,</HI> bought the Principality of <HI>Liege</HI> of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> when he went to the <HI>Holy Land:</HI> And in the Treaty of <HI>Cambray,</HI> 1559. the pos∣session of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> and precedency of Title, was gran∣ted to the Bishop of <HI>Liege,</HI> although at this time also the Houses of <HI>La Tour</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> do bear the same.</P>
<P>Of the Parish Churches that of St. <HI>John,</HI> and of St. <HI>Servasius</HI> are fair. Of the Abbies that of St. <HI>Jacob</HI> with∣in the Town, and of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> built by Bishop <HI>Ra∣ginardus</HI> upon an Hill out of the Town, are noble. There is also a Colledge of <HI>English</HI> Jesuites, well-seated upon a Hill, where the Garden is handsome, and the Dyals made by <HI>Franciscus Linus,</HI> are worth the seeing: And an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Nunnery handsomely built. In the Church of the <HI>Gu∣lielmites,</HI> out of the Town, lieth the Body of our famous Country-man Sir <HI>John Mandeville,</HI> who, after he had travelled through so many parts, took an affection unto this place, and here passed the remainder of his life, and whose Epitaph, and some Rarities of his, are still to be seen.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Notger,</HI> who was consecrated by St. <HI>Gereon,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Colen,</HI> and died in the year 1007. built the walls of this City, and being Tutor to <HI>Otho</HI> the third, he found means very much to beautifie it, to repair and build divers Churches, and endow them with rich Re∣venues, and let the River <HI>Maes</HI> into the Town, which be∣fore ran upon one side of it.</P>
<PB N="171" REF="98"/>
<P>As their Churches are fair and numerous, so are their Bells and Chimes remarkable. In the Cathedral of St. <HI>Lambert</HI> there are eight large Bells, and twelve lesser; and there is one so great, as it is said to require Twenty four men to ring it. In the Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI> the Bells and Chimes are considerable; as also at St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> and the <HI>crossed Friers.</HI> It is also an University, and was so famous in former Ages, that they still take notice that at one time there have been Nine Sons of Kings, Twenty four Dukes Sons, Twenty nine of Counts, besides many of great Barons Students therein.</P>
<P>Their Speech here, as also at <HI>Spaw,</HI> is called <HI>Roman,</HI> and is a kind of old <HI>French,</HI> or Dialect of that Language, a great part of which is made up of <HI>Latin,</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> words: and they call the Neighbouring Language of the <HI>Dutch, Tuiscon.</HI> But many speak very good <HI>French.</HI> They have some Vineyards affording a small Wine. The Hills about furnish them with Quarries of good Stone, and of several kinds. They have also divers Mines and Minerals, and great quantity of Pit-coal for Fire, in some places fetched deep out of the Earth, in others nearer the Surface: and in one place I saw them beginning to dig where they immediately found Coal. Their Pumps and Engines to draw out the water, are very considerable at these Mines; in some places moved by Wheels, at above a Furlongs distance, to which they are continued by strong Wood-work, which moves backwards and for∣wards continually.</P>
<P>The <HI>Citadel</HI> standeth upon a Hill, and is of great Strength; It was built to keep the City of <HI>Liege</HI> under Subjection. For 1649. there being some disturbances in the City, <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Colen,</HI> offering to come into the Town to appease it, was opposed by the Consul, <HI>Ja∣cobus
<PB N="172" REF="99"/> Hennet,</HI> who was soon after surprised and behead∣ed, together with <HI>Bartholomaeus Rolandus;</HI> the Consul ha∣ving sworn the Elector should never come in whilst he were alive. And the <HI>Citadel</HI> soon after was ordered to be built. The Bridges are handsome: that over the great Stream of the <HI>Maes</HI> is very broad and fair, and hath large Arches. From hence we could read the Elector's name upon the Citadel, <HI>Maximilianus,</HI> although it were at a very great distance, the Letters were so large.</P>
<P>From <HI>Liege</HI> we had a pleasant passage down the Water to <HI>Maestreicht,</HI> passing by <HI>Argentau,</HI> a Castle seated up∣on a high Rock on the right side of the River, belonging then to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> afterwards by <HI>Vichet</HI> in the half way, and then by <HI>Navagne,</HI> a strong Fort in the <HI>Maes,</HI> which commands the River, and at that time did the <HI>Spaniard</HI> service; then by pleasant Rocks on our left hand, wherein many Cuts and Passages have been digged, till we came in sight of <HI>Maestreicht.</HI></P>
<P>This Town having been a little before taken from the <HI>United States</HI> by a sharp Siege, was full of <HI>French,</HI> and had a Garrison in it of about Ten thousand men; and in the <HI>Market-place</HI> stood about Two hundred large Field∣pieces. We saw the places where they had their Batte∣ries and their Mines, and the Half-moon which the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> took: the Out-works were very nume∣rous, and many of them undermined. Colonel <HI>Storff</HI> shew'd us a handsome Draught of all the Works, Ap∣proaches and Manner of taking of the Town.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a Mile out of the Town we went into the great Quarry of Stone, which is one of the no∣blest sure in the World. Between <HI>Padoa</HI> and <HI>Vicenza</HI> I had formerly seen the famous Cave of <HI>Custoza,</HI> or <HI>Cubola,</HI> said to be above Five hundred Fathoms in breadth, and
<PB N="173" REF="99"/> Seven hundred in length, but this doth far surpass it: the Roof is very high and stately in most places, the Pil∣lars not to be numbred, all very large; we passed two miles under ground amongst them: No <HI>Labyrinth</HI> can be contrived more intricate, and yet all parts are uniform. The <HI>Floor</HI> all in a level, and the <HI>Roof</HI> in most places of the same height, and so much hath that uniform rule, which I suppose was set to those who first digged, and so hath successively been observed, added to the beauty of this place, that there is scarce any thing more noble. It put me in mind of the <HI>hundred Chambers of Nero,</HI> which he caused to be made under Ground in the <HI>Rocks</HI> at <HI>Baiae.</HI> And the <HI>Water</HI> which we met with in one place, made me think of <HI>Nero</HI>'s admirable <HI>Fish-pond,</HI> built in the like manner within the <HI>Earth.</HI> We came out again near to a <HI>Convent</HI> upon the <HI>Banks</HI> of the <HI>River,</HI> and returned by <HI>water</HI> to <HI>Maestreicht.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we parted Company. Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ettrick,</HI> Mr. <HI>Grove,</HI> Mr. <HI>Carlton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newcomb</HI> went for <HI>Aken</HI> and <HI>Colen;</HI> Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> and Mr. <HI>Daston</HI> went up the <HI>River</HI> again to <HI>Liege,</HI> at which place, staying a day or two to find a convenience to pass to <HI>Brussels,</HI> we were nobly entertained at a Dinner with <HI>Venison, Wild-boar,</HI> and other <HI>Dishes,</HI> by that worthy Person and Learned Mathematician <HI>Franciscus Slusius,</HI> one of the great <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>Liege,</HI> who also continued his high <HI>Civilities</HI> to us to the last <HI>Minute</HI> we stayed in <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Liege</HI> we soon came in sight of <HI>Tongres,</HI> or <HI>Tungrorum oppidum,</HI> the most ancient place in all these Countries. <HI>Ortelius</HI> would have it to be called of old <HI>Atuatuca:</HI> It was a strong hold before the coming of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> into <HI>Gaul,</HI> and was afterwards made a <HI>Ro∣man Station,</HI> and in process of time became so great,
<PB N="174" REF="100"/> that <HI>Attila</HI> the <HI>Hun</HI> destroyed an <HI>hundred Churches</HI> in it, it being at that time a <HI>Bishops See,</HI> which in the year 498 St. <HI>Servatius</HI> removed unto <HI>Maestreicht.</HI> Many old <HI>Coins</HI> and <HI>Antiquities</HI> are still found here; and part of an old <HI>Chappel,</HI> said to be built by St. <HI>Maternus,</HI> Disciple to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> is still remaining. When the King of <HI>France</HI> made his great inroad into the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> 1672. he borrowed this Town of the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and then passed on to <HI>Maseick,</HI> where crossing the Country to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> by the sides of these great Rivers, <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Maes,</HI> he made that notable <HI>Incursion,</HI> and quitted not <HI>Tongres</HI> till he had taken <HI>Maestreicht</HI> the year following. We dined this day at <HI>Borchloe,</HI> and lodged at St. <HI>Trurn,</HI> or St. <HI>Truden,</HI> a handsome little <HI>Town,</HI> so called from a <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Abby</HI> herein dedicated to that <HI>Saint.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we dined at <HI>Tienen,</HI> or <HI>Tilmont,</HI> on the little River <HI>Geet,</HI> once one of the chief Towns in <HI>Bra∣bant,</HI> but long since decayed. In these <HI>Plain Countries,</HI> in many places we saw small <HI>Hills,</HI> or <HI>Sepulchral Eminen∣ces</HI> of the <HI>Ground:</HI> And near unto the <HI>Walls</HI> of <HI>Yienen,</HI> are three very remarkable ones, said to be the <HI>Tombs</HI> of great <HI>Commanders.</HI> In the Evening we came to <HI>Lo∣vain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lovain</HI> is the chief <HI>City</HI> of that quarter of <HI>Brabant,</HI> which comprehendeth <HI>Arschot, Halen,</HI> and <HI>Judoigne;</HI> an ancient and large City, pleasantly seated upon the River <HI>Dele;</HI> it is of great <HI>Circuit,</HI> and the <HI>compass</HI> of the <HI>wall</HI> accounted above <HI>four miles</HI> about: but there are many void <HI>Spaces, Hills, Fields,</HI> and <HI>Gardens</HI> within it, which makes it very pleasant and delightful. There are herein divers good <HI>Buildings, Convents,</HI> and <HI>Chur∣ches:</HI> the chief whereof is the stately <HI>Church</HI> of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> the <HI>Convent</HI> of the <HI>Carthusians,</HI> the <HI>Hospital.</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="100"/> The publick <HI>Palace</HI> or <HI>Senate-house</HI> are also No∣ble.</P>
<P>It is the great <HI>University</HI> of these parts, said to have had its beginning about 926. but endowed by <HI>John</HI> the Fourth, Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and confirmed by Pope <HI>Mar∣tin</HI> the Fifth, 1425. There are Forty three <HI>Colledges</HI> in it; whereof the four chief are <HI>Lilium, Falco, Castrum, Porcus. Goropius Becanus,</HI> a Learned Man, and Native of <HI>Brussels,</HI> affirmeth, That no <HI>University</HI> in <HI>Italy, France, Germany,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> is to be compared unto it for its e∣legant and pleasant Situation. The <HI>University</HI> is under the Government of <HI>Rector,</HI> who is in great esteem and honour among them. This <HI>University</HI> hath produced many Learned Men: But neither the <HI>Buildings</HI> of the <HI>Col∣ledges,</HI> nor their <HI>Endowments</HI> do equal those of our <HI>Uni∣versities,</HI> and the Situation thereof seems not to exceed that of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>We travelled from hence to <HI>Brussels,</HI> being most part of the way in the sight of the very high Tower of the <HI>Church</HI> of St. <HI>Rombald</HI> at <HI>Machlin.</HI></P>
<P>Count <HI>Monterei</HI> was then Governour of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and resided at <HI>Brussels,</HI> the ordinary Seat of the <HI>Governours</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands;</HI> which <HI>City</HI> he had taken care to fortifie, and to make it more tena∣ble, if it should be attempted by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Brussels</HI> we passed to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where we were handsomely treated by Mr. <HI>Wauters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hartop,</HI> and having visited some of our Friends, the next day we passed the River <HI>Schelde,</HI> and took Coach in the morning, travelling through a fruitful, plain, flat Country, set with rows of <HI>Trees</HI> in most places, and arrived in the e∣vening at <HI>Ghent.</HI></P>
<PB N="176" REF="101"/>
<P><HI>Gaunt, Gandavum,</HI> or <HI>Ghent,</HI> is esteemed to be the greatest <HI>City,</HI> not only of <HI>Flanders,</HI> but of all the <HI>Law-Countries,</HI> and challengeth a pace amongst the greatest in <HI>Europe;</HI> but at present it decreaseth and decays ra∣ther than encreaseth. And if <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth were now alive, he could not put <HI>Paris</HI> into his <HI>Gant,</HI> a greater Glove would not fit that City, which is so much increa∣sed since his time. In <HI>Ghent</HI> are many noble <HI>Convents,</HI> among which the <HI>Jesuites</HI> is one of the fairest: There is a <HI>Cloister</HI> also of <HI>English Nuns.</HI> The <HI>Cathedral</HI> is stately, and the <HI>Tower</HI> belonging to it being very high, gives a prospect of a pleasant and fruitful Country round a∣bout it. There are divers <HI>Piazza's,</HI> large and fair; in one of which stands a large gilded <HI>Statua</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Emperour and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was born in this City. The whole <HI>Town</HI> is generally well-built, and the <HI>Streets</HI> are fair and clean. The <HI>Inhabitants</HI> hereof have been taken notice of to be extreamly given to <HI>Se∣dition,</HI> and for their sakes a great many other <HI>Cities</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> are punished, and have in a manner totally lost their <HI>Liberties:</HI> For the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to curb the Sediti∣ous humour of the People of <HI>Ghent,</HI> were put upon the Invention of building <HI>Citadels</HI> in <HI>Cities,</HI> whereby a few <HI>Souldiers</HI> are able to suppress any <HI>Commotion,</HI> or beat down the <HI>Town,</HI> so that here I saw the first <HI>Citadel</HI> that was built in <HI>Europe</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth: It is not large, and the <HI>Bastions</HI> little, and though of a Regular Figure, yet not so convenient as those of latter days, since that Art hath been improved.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ghent</HI> we passed by water about Twenty <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> miles to <HI>Bruges,</HI> a very elegant large City, and for∣merly a place of very great Trade, being within three Leagues of the Sea; so that from the tops of their high∣est
<PB N="177" REF="101"/> <HI>Buildings,</HI> the Ships under Sail are visible, and at the same time a Fleet of Ships, and a large Territory of a fruitful, pleasant Country, cometh under your eye. It is fortified with Works of <HI>Earth</HI> and deep <HI>Ditches.</HI> The <HI>Convents</HI> are numerous: The artificial Cuts of <HI>Wa∣ter</HI> from this Town to all places, maketh it of easie ac∣cess; and though it hath no <HI>Port,</HI> the <HI>Passage</HI> from hence to <HI>Ostend</HI> by <HI>water</HI> is short: And they are at present up∣on a Design of bringing Ships up to this <HI>City.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ostend</HI> is about Ten <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Bruges,</HI> seated upon the waves of the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, which wash it continually on one side: And they have now contrived it so, as to let the Sea in almost round the Town for a great space, whereby it is become much more strong and de∣fensible than before. For when I looked upon it, and considered what it was when it was besieged by Arch∣duke <HI>Albertus,</HI> and taken by Marquiss <HI>Ambrosius Spino∣la,</HI> 1604. with an honourable Surrender after three years Siege, I cannot but ascribe very much unto their Sup∣plies from <HI>England,</HI> and the obstinate Valour of the De∣fendants, especially the <HI>English</HI> under Sir <HI>Francis Vere. Sluys</HI> being in the hands of the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>United Pro∣vinces,</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> under the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> possess no other <HI>Port</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> but this and <HI>Newport;</HI> and this being the most considerable, they are now ma∣king the <HI>Haven</HI> large, and are upon a considerable Work in order to the carrying of their Ships over into that Cut which goeth from <HI>Ostend</HI> to <HI>Bruges,</HI> out of their Har∣bour, by the means of a very great <HI>Lock</HI> or Receptacle of <HI>Water,</HI> which is to communicate with both; which, when it is finished, may be very advantageous to the <HI>Traffick.</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands.</HI> This <HI>Town</HI> stands very low, but the <HI>Streets</HI> are streight, large, and uniform</P>
<PB N="178" REF="102"/>
<P>From hence I went all along upon the Sea-shoar to <HI>Newport,</HI> a handsome <HI>Town,</HI> with large fair <HI>Streets,</HI> but low built. There were then a great number of small Ships in the <HI>Harbour.</HI> This place is famous for the Bat∣tel of <HI>Newport,</HI> fought here by <HI>Albertus,</HI> and Count <HI>Maurice,</HI> wherein the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces lost the day, and much of the honour of the Field was due unto the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> under Sir <HI>Francis Vere;</HI> since which time, although there hath been much blood shed in these Quarters, yet there hath not been so considerable a Battel ever since, al∣though the <HI>English</HI> had also the fortune to do great Ser∣vice hereabout at a fight called the Battel of the <HI>Sandhils,</HI> when a part of the Army of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> which besieged <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> fought with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces by <HI>New∣port,</HI> and overthrew them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Newport</HI> we put to Sea, sailing out of the Har∣bour, and intending for <HI>England;</HI> but the wind being ve∣ry high and contrary, after having been at Sea all the night, and had leisure to take notice of the great number of <HI>Sands</HI> upon that Coast, in the morning we put into <HI>Mardike,</HI> where at present there is only a Fort of Wood just above the High-water mark, with some few Guns mounted. The other Fort, more into the Land, being demolished.</P>
<P><HI>Dunkirk</HI> is much increased of late, and the King of <HI>France</HI> hath not spared mony to render it considerably strong. He hath very near finished a noble <HI>Citadel,</HI> begun by the <HI>English</HI> while this Town was in their possession, which hath the <HI>Sea</HI> on one side of it, the <HI>Haven</HI> on another, and the <HI>Sandhills</HI> towards the Land, which when the wind is at South-west, doth somewhat annoy it: To prevent which, the <HI>French</HI> have made divers Cuts and Chanels through the <HI>Sands,</HI> into which the Sea entring, doth moi∣sten and fix the Sand, so as they are not so apt to fly. And
<PB N="179" REF="102"/> every <HI>Bastion</HI> is sprucely kept and covered within with green Turf. Beyond the old Wall of the Town, there are now great Works drawn, which encompass so large a space of Ground, that the Town is made bigger by half: And in this part stands the <HI>English</HI> Nunnery, and many handsome Buildings. The new Fortifications are very large; and the Bastion towards the North the most stately, upon which the King of <HI>France</HI> entertained the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> The Port is large, and capable of receiving a great number of Ships, but at low water it is almost dry; and there are so many Sands before it, that at that time the Sea comes not in any depth within a mile of it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dunkirk</HI> we travelled by Land to <HI>Graveling,</HI> where the Works are of Earth, large and high, the Church stately, the Streets broad, but the Houses low, and at present not populous.</P>
<P>From <HI>Graveling</HI> I came to <HI>Calais,</HI> from whence setting Sail in the morning, we came to <HI>Dover,</HI> and the same day to <HI>London.</HI></P>
