<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS well known, that Ireland was conquer'd at first by the <HI>English,</HI> and bad been all along un∣der the easie Yoke of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> till <HI>James</HI> II. ascended the Throne. But he, by a Policy, contrary to all the World, designing to subdue <HI>Eng∣land</HI> to Popery and <HI>French</HI> Government, endeavour'd all he could to have made <HI>Ireland</HI> in her Turn the Instrument of that preposterous Conquest. To which purpose, he made use of the general Inclination of that People to the Romish Religion, sent for whole Regiments of that Nation into <HI>England,</HI> bred 'em up both for. Officers and Souldiers, with no less Care than the Turks do their <HI>Janizaries;</HI> and when he had fill'd all {iIre∣land} with expert Warriors, deliver'd up the whole Power of the Government into the hands of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks; so that all that part of the <HI>English</HI> Monarchy was only tackt to <HI>England,</HI> by the single Thread of Papistical Obedience, during a Catholick Reign. After which, King <HI>James</HI> himself, ha∣ving abdicated <HI>England,</HI> headed a general Revolt of the <HI>Irish</HI> from the Imperial Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which had only left subordinate to it the City of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and one Corner of <HI>Ulster.</HI> So that so fair a Portion of the <HI>British</HI> Dominion, so Convenient for spacious <HI>Harbors,</HI> so fertile for the Soil, so abounding in all Things for the support of humane Life, and so particularly famous for admitting no venomous Crea∣tures to live in it, but only Priests and Jesuits, was either to be quite lost, or quite to be re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conquer'd.</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>Therefore while the late King <HI>James,</HI> assisted with <HI>French</HI> Succours, commanded all things, and had set the forfeited Crown of <HI>Irleand</HI> upon his <HI>Head,</HI> Duke <HI>Schomberg</HI> was by King <HI>William</HI> sent to stop the Career of the abdicated Prince, and his abominated Crew of <HI>Gallick</HI> Foreigners. And first of all the Duke, like the Roman <HI>Fabius, Cunctando resti∣tuit rem.</HI> Next King <HI>William</HI> in Person, like the far-fam'd <HI>Scipio,</HI> forc'd the defeated Invader to abandon the King∣dom. And now, lastly, this Campaign, and second <HI>Summer</HI> from the Contest begun, you see the threatning War concluded, while the renowned <HI>Ginckle,</HI> like a Torrent, sweeps all before him, and after his having broken the Enemy in Battle, stript 'em of all their strong <HI>Holds</HI> by storm, or constrain'd 'em to surrender, and scatter'd the Fugitives to starve among the Moun∣tains, leaves no part of the whole Kingdom unreduced under the Obedience of her lawful Sovereigns. Atchievments not at∣tain'd by Number, but by Courage and Conduct, and meriting large <HI>Encomiums,</HI> beyond the narrow Limits of a Preface.</P>
<P>And now I would fain know what are become of those brisk <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who thought a languishing <HI>French</HI> Cause could be supported by laying malicious and extravagant Wagers. Where-e'er they are, they have nothing now to do, but to pay their lost Money, and, with <HI>Hudibrass,</HI> conclude, That Wa∣gers are Fools Arguments. And indeed, 'tis pity, they do not live at this time in <HI>France,</HI> where the King is setting so many Projects on foot to raise Money. For their Names would cer∣tainly be taken, to inform the King where the Men of Money liv'd. And then he presently sends his Officers for such a <HI>Sum</HI> to be re-paid <HI>ad Graecas Kalendas.</HI> I only tell'ent the <HI>Story;</HI> let them pick out the <HI>Inference</HI> themselves.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXACT JOURNAL OF THE Victorious Progress of Their <HI>Majesties Forces</HI> this <HI>Summer</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Majesty, King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> III. by the pro∣sperous Success of his Arms at the <HI>Boyn</HI> the last Year, was in a very short time become Master of the greatest patt of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and had driven the late King <HI>James</HI> quite out of the Kingdom; but the Season of the Year, and the excessive Rains, so frequent in that Country, would not permit him any farther Action. For which reason, after he had given order for his Forces to take up their Winter-Quarters in such a Manner, as to shut up the Rebels within the most narrow limits that might be, and prevent their Incursions into the regain'd Countries, His Majesty returned for <HI>England;</HI> leaving to Com∣mand the Army and compleat his Conquests, General <HI>Ginkle,</HI> a Person of great Experience, Fidelity, Conduct and Expedi∣tion; as will appear by the ensuing Journal. So that if Story receive its lustre from the Grandeur of the Actions which it re∣lates, perhaps this Journal may be thought as considerable as has for many years come forth; as well for the Courage of the Souldiers, the Difficulty and Success of their Euterprizes, and the Importance of their Conquests.
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>During the <HI>Winter,</HI> Both sides lay quiet, but the very Ap∣proach of Spring warm'd the <HI>English</HI> to Action, which tho' not so considerable, yet was preparatory to facilitate the Opening of the grand Campaign, which did not begin till sometime after. For upon the <HI>14th.</HI> of <HI>March</HI> (where this Journal begins) Colo∣nel <HI>Lillington,</HI> between eight and nine at Night, march'd from <HI>Roscreagh,</HI> with a Party of his own, which being joyn'd by ano∣ther from <HI>Bix,</HI> made up together Three Hundred Horse, Foot and Dragoons, and advanc'd toward <HI>Nagah;</HI> but finding the way to be longer then he expected, and day coming on, he de∣tach'd Eighteen Horse and as many Foot, which he mounted upon <HI>Garrans,</HI> and made all the haste he could to secure the Bridge about half a Mile from <HI>Nenagh.</HI> Upon which the whole Garrison sallied out, to oppose him: However with that small party he maintain'd the Pass, till his Foot came up; and then leaving them at the Bridge, he advanc'd with his Horse toward the Enemy, who at a distance were very free of their Shot, but so soon as the <HI>English</HI> came nere them, began to run: upon which the <HI>English</HI> pursu'd them, and kill'd about Twenty, of which number was a Lieutenant, and took one Cornet. This done, the Colonel sent a Detachment to secure the Pass on the other side of <HI>Nenagh,</HI> towards <HI>Limerick,</HI> while the rest of his Men entered the Town (the Rebels flying into the Castle) and burnt all the Houses, together with a great Quantity of Malt and Mcal, and brought away three hundred Head of black Cat∣tel, with the Loss but of two Men slain out-right, and another wounded; but of the Rebels were kill'd between forty and fifty.</P>
<P>At the same time News came from <HI>Cork,</HI> that upon advice that a Party of the Rebels were come before <HI>Ballimagoolis,</HI> a fron∣tier Garrison possess'd by the <HI>English</HI> in that County, a Party was sent from <HI>Cork</HI> to relieve it, of which the Enemy being inform'd, they drew off in great disorder; whereupon the Garrison sallied out, kill['d several of the Enemy, and took sever Prisoners.</P>
<P>Upon the 15th of <HI>March</HI> a detach'd Party or 150 Dragoons, 100 Militia-Horse, and 130 Foot, marched from <HI>Cork</HI> under the Command of Major <HI>Culliford,</HI> toward <HI>Ballyclongh,</HI> where the Rebels were about to have entrench'd themselves; but upon the appearing of the <HI>English,</HI> they quitted their Works, and fled with that haste, that all the <HI>English</HI> could do in the pursuit was,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>to take seven Prisoners, of which four were Officers. With better success a Party of Sir <HI>David Collier</HI>'s Regiment, quartered about <HI>Bandon,</HI> together with some of the <HI>Militia</HI> of that Place, 300 in all, Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <HI>George Hamilton,</HI> mar∣ched at the same time into the Enemies Quarters about <HI>Bantry,</HI> where they killed above seventy of the Rebels, took fifteen Priso∣ners, six hundred Head of Black Cattel, and a good number of Horses, without the loss of one Man.</P>
<P>Of this Action, soon after there came a more full account: That upon notice that Brigadier <HI>Caroll</HI> had a design to send five Companies of Foot, with some Ammunition, to joyn Collonel <HI>O Donavan,</HI> in order to maintain <HI>Bantry,</HI> and put the Country under Contribution; Lieut. Coll. <HI>Hamilton</HI> marched on the 15th of <HI>March,</HI> with 200 Foot of Sir <HI>David Colliers</HI> Regiment, 60 Horse commanded by Lieut. Coll. <HI>Ogilby,</HI> and 80 of the Militia, and the next day about two in the Afternoon, came in sight of <HI>Bantry;</HI> but finding that the Enemy had quitted the Place the same Morning, followed them with all the expedition he could. Whereupon the Enemy, perceiving themselves so closely pur∣sued, left all their Cattel behind, and betook themselves into the Bogs; however the <HI>English</HI> followed 'em four Miles, kill'd about 40, took 14 Prisoners, Coll. <HI>Courcy</HI> narrowly escaping, and brought off 1500 Head of Black Cattel, leaving several thousands be∣hind, for want of People to drive 'em, That night the <HI>English</HI> stay'd at <HI>Bantry;</HI> and the next day, after they had burnt the Town, returned back. In their way, the Enemy had laid 600 Men in Ambush, about six Miles from <HI>Bantry;</HI> but being disco∣vered by the Vantcurriers of the Party, after one Volly they ran away to their Hills and Bogs, whither the <HI>English</HI> could not pur∣suc them</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 25. Thirty of the Militia-Dragoons, commanded by Lieutenant <HI>Powel,</HI> were ordered to fetch up several Persons out of the County of <HI>Meath,</HI> who were suspected to have been concer∣ned in the Murther of Coll. <HI>Foulks</HI>'s Souldiers; but in his re∣turn, he had notice that a Party of Rapparees way-laid him not far from <HI>Hackets</HI>-Town, with a Resolution to rescue the Prisoners: Upon which, he sent away seventeen of his Dragoons with the Prisoners, and with the other thirteen marched to <HI>Hackets</HI>-Town; where sending for the Constable, after some hard threat∣ning
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>Words, the Constable inform'd him where the Rapparees lay; and then he immediately march'd to find 'em out. So soon as he approached the Place, he advanced with four of his Men into a Field adjoyning, where he fell in with a Party of twenty eight <HI>Irish,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>O Neale.</HI> The Enemy seeing so small a number, came up and fired at 'em, but without doing any hurt to the <HI>English,</HI> who answer'd them in the same Element to better purpose, killing two of the Rebels, and wounding <HI>O Neale</HI> himself. By which time, the rest of the <HI>English,</HI> being come in, charged the <HI>Irish,</HI> and kill'd four of them, put the rest to flight, and pursued them from place to place, till they had killed about twenty of them, and among the rest their Captain <HI>O Neale;</HI> who be∣ing wounded before, was now perfectly cured; his Enemies becom∣ing his Surgeons. Of the <HI>English</HI> only three were wounded, and two Horses kill'd.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 27. Captain <HI>Mark Baggot,</HI> who came as a Spy from <HI>Limerick,</HI> and was taken in Womens Apparel, was try'd, and sen∣tenc'd by a Court-Martial; but his Execution was respited, upon his offering to make some discovery. However, it appear∣ing afterwards that he did but dally with Justice, and that all his pretended Discoveries were of no moment, he was hang'd out∣right upon the Twentieth of <HI>May</HI> following. At the conclusion of this Month, a Proclamation was published in <HI>Dublin,</HI> bearing Date <HI>March</HI> 26. purporting,</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">That notwithstanding the great Clemency extended by their Majesties to the Popish, <HI>Irish,</HI> whereby upon their submission they have had equal protection with their Protestant Subjects, yet such was the inveterate Malice of many, that upon all occa∣sions they not only relieved their Majesties Enemies, but joyn∣ed with them in committing and concealing many horrid Mur∣thers, one of which of eight Souldiers inhumanly strangled at one time, and in one place, was lately discovered, to have been per∣petrated by the Inhabitants of the Place where the Souldiers were quartered, for which some of the Criminals had receiv'd just Punishment: And the Lords Justices-being fully satisfied that such Offences could not be committed without the help or con∣nivance of the Protected Inhabitants; and having received In∣formation that there was a Confederacy among them to relieve their Majesties Enemies, and to take all Opportunities to destroy
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>their Officers and Souldiers; their Lordships therefore declar'd, That if any such Murthers be hereafter committed, and the Inhabitants do not use their utmost endeavours to apprehend the Malefactors, that they shall be put out of their Majesties protection, and be proceeded against as Spies and Enemies, accor∣ding to the course of War.</Q></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2. Coll. <HI>Tiffin</HI> sent out from <HI>Ballyshannon</HI> a Party of two hundred Foot, and two Troops of Coll. <HI>Winns</HI> Dragoons, who marched within three Miles of <HI>Slego,</HI> where they kill'd thirty two of Captain <HI>Macksherry</HI>'s Men, and took nine, and brought away with them a Booty of 180 Cows, 50 Sheep, and 30 Horses; but the Captain with the rest made their Escapes to the Moun∣tains.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 4. A Party of <HI>Longford</HI> Garison, meeting with some of the Enemies Dragoons neear the River <HI>Enye,</HI> slew six; upon which, the rest taking the River where it was not fordable, ten more of them were drown'd: Such a strange thing is Fear, that it makes many Men run from one Death to another.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 5. A small Party of Dragoons, commanded by Quar∣ter-Master <HI>Topham,</HI> met with a detach'd Party of the Rebels, under the Command of Captain <HI>Bourke;</HI> of which they slew five, and an Ensign, the rest betaking themselves to their heels.</P>
<P>The same day Brigadier <HI>Stewart</HI> sent from <HI>Belturbat</HI> a Detach∣ment of fifty Foot and twenty Dragoons, under the Command of Captain <HI>Stewart,</HI> with Orders to march toward <HI>Mohil,</HI> to free the Country from the <HI>Rapparees.</HI> The next morning, by break of day, being come within a Mile of the Place, they discover'd two Troops of the Enemies Dragoons, and about fifty Foot, that were guarding some <HI>Kereights;</HI> upon which, the <HI>English</HI> see to work with them, without any Preambles; but the Rebels, after the first firing, quitted their Horses, and betook themselves to the Woods and Bogs, whither the <HI>English</HI> Foot pursuing them, made a shift to kill thirty, and take five Prisoners: Which done, the Victors return'd to their Quarters, without any manner of Loss, bringing along with them about an hundred Head of Black Cattel, and between sixty and seventy Horses.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 6. Quarter-Master <HI>Topham,</HI> with eighteen Dragoons and twelve Foot-Souldiers mounted upon <HI>Garrans,</HI> surpriz'd the Ene∣mies Guards near <HI>Newsastle,</HI> killed seventeen, and brought away
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>nine Prisoners, seven of which being found to be <HI>Rapparees,</HI> were immediately hang'd.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 7. Fifteen hundred of the <HI>Irish</HI> Army came before <HI>Inish∣keam,</HI> and attackt the Garrison of that Place, consisting of no more than forty four Men, commanded by Ensign <HI>Lindsay</HI> and Ensign <HI>Dalyel;</HI> but notwithstanding so great a multitude of the Rebels, a part of that small Garrison defended the two Avenues to the Town above two Hours, till some of the Popish Inhabi∣tants treacherously gave the Enemy entrance into the Town through a by-way, and then the <HI>English</HI> retreated to the main Guard, which they maintain'd six Hours longer, at what time the Rebels summoned the Defendants to surrender; and upon their refusal, had brought together several Hundreds of Faggots to fire the Guard-House; when in the very nick of Opportnnity, Collonel <HI>Ogilby,</HI> with a Party of Horse and Foot, came to their Relief; upon whose approach, the Enemy drew off in confusion; which the Garrison perceiving, sallied out upon the Rebels, and kill'd about fifty, with no more than the loss of one Man.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 9. Some of Captain <HI>Green</HI>'s Militia-Dragoons, marching into the Enemies Quarters, kill'd several of the <HI>Rapparees,</HI> and laid in Ashes a Village that gave them harbor. The same day also a Court-Martial was held, where Brigadier <HI>Stewart</HI> presided, and where several Persons, who upon their Tryals appear'd to be Spies, and such as had assisted and sheltered the <HI>Rapparees,</HI> were sentenced to be hanged.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 13. Quarter-Master <HI>Callaghan</HI> went out with a Party, and in a short time after, return'd with eleven Prisoners, twelve Horses, and seventy Head of Black Cattel.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 18. General <HI>Ginkle</HI> arrived at <HI>Dublin,</HI> whither most of the General Officers repaired at the same time, to consult with the Lords Justices about the Affairs of the Campaign, and hast∣ning their Majesties Forces to take the Field; which he was the more encourag'd to do, in regard that the <HI>Monmouth</HI> Yacht had already brought Money for the Army, and that several other Ships were arrived at <HI>Cork, Waterford,</HI> and <HI>Kingsale,</HI> with Re∣cruits both of Horse and Foot, of which two thousand were by that time come to <HI>Dublin,</HI> where, through the great Care and Diligence of the General, the Train of Artillery, with the Wag∣gons and Carriages lay all ready fitted.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<P>Much about the same time was published a Proclamation for the apprehending and securing <HI>Christopher Brown</HI> a Romish Priest, who by the Examinations of several Persons, appeared to be, if no the first Contriver, and principal Directer, yet a main Abetter and Incourager of the Murther of many of their Ma∣jesties Souldiers, in <HI>Mallahudder</HI>'s Church; and proposing a Reward of Fifty Pounds for any Person that should seize him.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 19. No less than seven hundred of the <HI>Irish</HI> standing-Army attackt a Stone-House, called <HI>Croghan,</HI> near <HI>Philipstown,</HI> and valiantly took a Corporal and six common Souldiers, after they had with much more Bravery defended themselves till all their Powder was spent, and that they had killed twelve of the Enemy.</P>
<P>But this Loss was reveng'd the same day with advantage; for the <HI>English</HI> being inform'd, that a considerable number of the Rebels were come near to <HI>Macromp,</HI> one of their Majesties Fron∣tier Garrisons, a Party of eighty Horse and an nundred and fifty Dragoons, of the Army, and as many of the Militia, was drawn out under the Command of Major <HI>Kirk.</HI> This Party marched the 19th in the Evening, and by break of day the next Morning came up with the Rebels, who presently took to their Sanctua∣ries in the Woods and Bogs, whither the <HI>English</HI> pursu'd them; and after a chace of some hours kill'd twenty, took five Prisoners, and brought off some Horses and Cattel. Much about the same time the <HI>Rapparees</HI> coming with a strong Party to <HI>Curraglass</HI> near <HI>Tallough,</HI> had stollen some Horses belonging to Collonel <HI>Denopp</HI>'s Regiment, and surpriz'd four Troops. Upon which, the Collo∣nel gave present Orders for the taking up several of the <HI>Irish.</HI> In∣habitants about that place; declaring withal, That if they did not procure the Horses and Men to be brought back by such a certain day, they should every one be hang'd: Which wrought so effectually upon the Prisoners, that both Men and Horses were brought back, by the time appointed, to the place where they were taken; and for a further Attonement of the Injury done, some of the Fellows also, that had been Actors in the Rob∣bery.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<P>At the same time three hundred <HI>Rapparees,</HI> lying in Ambu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cade, not far from <HI>Kennegad,</HI> had seiz'd upon forty eight Sack of Meal, that were going thither with a very small Guard that made their escapes; of which notice being given to the Town, a Party of the Garrison fally'd out, recover'd a good part of the Meal, and kill'd several of the <HI>Rapparees,</HI> with their Cap∣tain.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 24. Captain <HI>Pallaser,</HI> upon some intelligence that was given him of the <HI>Rapparees,</HI> march'd out with forty Fire-locks of the Army, and twenty of the Militia; but by the Treachery of one <HI>Terence Magragh,</HI> was drawn into an Ambush of no less than two of the Enemies Regiments of Foot and some Horse: Never∣theless, the <HI>English</HI> got into the Ruins of an old Castle, where theless, the <HI>English</HI> got into the Ruins of an old Castle, where they vigoriously defended themselves till all their Ammunition was spent; but then were forc'd to accept of Quarter, and were carried Prisoners to <HI>Nanagh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 27. The Earl of <HI>Meath</HI>'s, and the Lord <HI>Lisburn</HI>'s Regi∣ments arrived at <HI>Mullingar,</HI> and encamp'd without the Town. The same day one <HI>Walter Brown,</HI> formerly High Constable of the Barony of <HI>Delwyn,</HI> was hang'd for a Spy in the same Town. And upon the same 27th of <HI>April</HI> also it was, that five hundred of the Militia of the County of <HI>Dublin,</HI> marched out of that City to the Town of <HI>Kildare,</HI> where they joyn'd the Regiment of Horse, commanded by Collonel <HI>Piper,</HI> and which were design'd to clear those parts from the Robberies and Violences of the <HI>Rapparees.</HI> And the same day arriv'd in <HI>Dublin</HI> Road the Ships from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> laden with the Stores for the Artillery and Ordnance.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 28. Collonel <HI>Brewer,</HI> and Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Hamilton,</HI> with six hundred Foot and twenty Horse, marched into the Enemies Quarters beyond the Castle of <HI>Donere,</HI> between which place and <HI>Kilbegan,</HI> about two thousand of the <HI>Rapparces</HI> had for some time shelter'd themselves in Hutts and Cabins. But though at the first sight of the <HI>English</HI> they drew up in a kind of Bravado, upon the Hills, in several Bodies of Horse and Foot, yet upon the Collonels nearer approach, they flew to their Bogs and Woods, whither the <HI>English</HI> pursu'd them, kill'd about fifty, and after they had burnt a great number of their Hutts and Hovels, returned to their Quarters.</P>

<P><HI>April</HI> 30. Capt. <HI>Clayton</HI> was sent with a Party of Men, to relieve the Garrison of <HI>Ballimagooly,</HI> where Capt. <HI>Hornycrose</HI> then comman∣ded, and was the same day to have march'd his Men to <HI>Cork,</HI> so soon as Captain <HI>Clayton</HI> had relieved him. But understanding that the Garrison of <HI>Ballyclough</HI> had a design to intercept him, he thought it not convenient to march by day, and therefore set forward about 12 a Clock at Night. However, this was not so privately carried, but that the <HI>Irish</HI> had notice of it, and thereupon drew out a hun∣dred and twenty of their best Horse, and as many Dragoons, with two hundred and fifty Voluntiers and <HI>Rapparees,</HI> commanded by Brigadier <HI>Caroll,</HI> Sir <HI>James Cotter,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Kinsale,</HI> Collo∣nel <HI>Lasly,</HI> Major <HI>Slingsby,</HI> Captain <HI>Coppinger</HI> and Captain <HI>Comb∣don,</HI> who fell upon the <HI>English</HI> just on the other side of <HI>Six-mile∣water,</HI> about three of the Clock in the Morning. Upon their ap∣proach, the <HI>English</HI> faced, and about twenty fired upon the Ene∣my so well to the purpose, that they brake the Rebels Front, and put them into some disorder; which gave the <HI>English</HI> a good opportunity to retreat to an old Pound that had a Mud-wall about it, breast-high, and to clap up a Truckle at the place where they entred. Whereupon the advanced Party of the Enemy, belie∣ving the day their own, boldly made up to the Pound, and of∣fered the Captain and his Man Quarter; which he refusing, they began a brisk Charge, and pressed hard upon the <HI>English,</HI> by whom the Rebels were so warmly received, that several of their Number were slain, and carried off, during the heat of the Acti∣on: However, they made a second and a third Attack, though with the same ill success. And thus the Conflict lasted for seve∣ral hours, till notice of it being carried to <HI>Cork,</HI> a Party was forthwith sent from thence to the Captain's relief; but the Ene∣my were all fled before they arrived, leaving dead upon the place Captain <HI>Coppinger</HI> and Caprain <HI>Combdon:</HI> Collonel <HI>Lasly</HI> and the Lord of <HI>Kinsale</HI> were likewise dangerously wounded, and carried off, and about fifty more wounded. Major <HI>Slingsby</HI> was brought dangerously wounded to <HI>Cork,</HI> where, in little hopes of Life, he was so ingenious as to confess, That he believed the Hand of <HI>God</HI> was against their Party, for that altlio' they offered and promised Quarter to the <HI>English,</HI> yet had they yielded, they had resolved to put them all to the Sword. Of the <HI>English</HI> were lost no more than eight Men out of fourscore; but of the Enemy 'tis be∣lieved that more were kill'd and wounded than those they fought against.</P>

<P>At the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the Lords Justices put forth a Pro∣clamation, strictly charging and commanding all Officers, Civil and Military, and all Souldiers of their Majesties Army, not to molest any Sutlers that should have a Warrant from the Lord Justices, the General of the Army, or Collonel of any Regi∣ment, to follow the Camp; nor to take any thing from the said Sutlers, nor to use any violence towards them, upon pain of be∣ing severely proceeded against: And that the Collonels should take care that the Souldiers paid for every thing they had of the Sutlers, according to the setled Rates: And to prevent the Rob∣beries and Spoils committed upon the Country, by several unne∣cessary Persons that followed the Camp, they further ordered all their Majesties Subjects, both Protestants and Papists, to stay at, or repair to, their several Habitations, for the Preservation and Improvement of the same; and that no Persons should pre∣sume to follow the Camp, but such as brought Provisions to the Army, or upon some lawful occasion approved by the General, or Commander in Chief.</P>
<P>By another Proclamation, all the Inhabitants of the Counties of <HI>Waterford</HI> and <HI>Tipperary,</HI> were commanded to repair to their Places of Habitation, or the next Garrison; and the Inhabitants of the Counties of <HI>Cork, Limerick,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> were ordered to do the same, in order to their being employed in the Militia, for the Defence of the Country, when their Army should be drawn into the Field.</P>
<P>And by an Order of General <HI>Ginkle,</HI> all Officers and Souldiers, and all other Persons whatsoever, were strictly commanded not to press any Horses or Carts, without license from himself in writing; nor to press any Horse that was actually listed in the Militia, upon any pretence whatever.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 1. Captain <HI>Thomas White</HI> of the old Lord <HI>George Hamil∣ton</HI>'s Regiment, drew out an hundred Men under the Command of Captain <HI>Johnston,</HI> who marched with his Party to <HI>Belnamona</HI> in <HI>Kings County,</HI> where he had such good success, that by break of day he surprized two Troops of Dragoons of Brigadier <HI>Clif∣ford</HI>'s Regiment, and three Troops of Horse of the Lord <HI>Merrion</HI>'s Regiment, kill'd Lieutenant <HI>Archibald,</HI> Quarter-Master <HI>Barnell,</HI> and fifteen Dragoons, took two Ensigns, and other Pri∣soners, burnt the Town, and returned with a good Booty of Horses, Arms and Cattel.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> 3. The Governour of <HI>Clonmel,</HI> with a Detachment of
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>Horse, and two Troops of the Militia-Dragoons, marched by Night into the Enemies Quarters toward <HI>Michels-Town;</HI> but not meeting with any of the Rebels, was returning back to his Quar∣ters, when a Corporal of Horse making a halt a little behind, was shot at by four <HI>Rapparees:</HI> Upon which, the <HI>English</HI> surroun∣ded the Wood; and after some hours Man-Hunting, killed above thirty of the <HI>Rapparees,</HI> and one <HI>Cashan</HI> their Captain.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 4. Major <HI>Wood</HI> marched from <HI>Mountmilock</HI> to <HI>Castle-Cuff,</HI> with a Party of three hundred Foot, drawn out of Collo∣nel <HI>Lloyd</HI>'s and the Lord <HI>George Hamilton</HI>'s Regiment, and fifty Horse of Collonel <HI>Byerly</HI>'s. In his march, he divided the Foot in∣to several small Parties, in order to surprize the <HI>Rapparees</HI> in the woods and Bogs, keeping with the Horse along the skirts of the Bog, to hinder their escape: By which means, they made a shift to kill about seventy <HI>Rapparees,</HI> and to take a good num∣ber of their Cattel. Which done, Major <HI>Wood</HI> advanc'd with thirty Foot, and thirty four Horse, beyond the <HI>Togher</HI> of <HI>Mal∣lybone,</HI> and from thence sent the Cattel homeward under a Guard of thirty Men, and was returning to his Party with those few that were with him, about ten of the Clock in the Morning, when he discover'd two Bodies of Men of the late Kings Army, com∣puted to consist of four hundred each Body, marching silently between the Wood and the Mountains; but who, so soon as they perceiv'd themselves to be espy'd, beat their Drums; upon which, the Major drew up the chiefest part of his whole Party in a Plough'd field, and fac'd 'em: Presently the Enemies Granadiers came over the Hedge, and made towards the Major, till seeing the <HI>English</HI> stand firm, they also made a halt. Whereupon the Major, apprehending that the thirty Men that guarded the Booty, were not got clear of the Wood, and consequently might be exposed to the Enemies Numbers, wheel'd off by the skirt of the Wood to their succor; and by that time he had got his Horse and Foot over the Bog, he heard the Enemy firing very thick upon the thirty Men, who bravely however oppos'd 'em, under the Command of Lieutenant <HI>Ellis.</HI> The noise of this firing brought in fourscore more of the <HI>English,</HI> who had been laid to watch the <HI>Rapparees.</HI> Thereupon Major <HI>Wood</HI> order'd the Foot to march in two Parties on each side the River, while he with the Horse march'd between 'em both. Being in this manner come within sight of the Enemy, and judging that the Horse might do most service, by fetching a compass about, and getting behind
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>the Rebels, he gallop'd round, with an intention to fall upon their Reer; which the Enemy perceiving, and being at the same time hard put to it by the Foot, began to make an orderly Re∣treat. But then it was, that the Major, unwilling to lose his Ad∣vantage, fell immediately upon-their Flank with his Horse, and that with so much Courage and undaunted Bravery, that he put the Enemy first into great disorder, and soon after to an absolute flight. Both Horse and Foot pursu'd the Fugitives quite through the Wood down to the Bog, and kill'd about 150 among whom was Capt. <HI>Chales,</HI> with 2 Lieutenants, and took Prisoners Maj. <HI>John Fitz-Patrick</HI> who commanded the whole Force, 5 Captains, 9 Lieute∣nants, 2 Ensigns (belonging to the several Regiments of Coll. <HI>Butler</HI> of <HI>Ballyraggats,</HI> Collonel <HI>Robert Grace,</HI> Collonel <HI>Charles Moore,</HI> Sir <HI>Morice Eustace,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Simon Lutterel</HI>'s Dragoons) and a hundred and five private Souldiers, six Serjeants, seventeen Cor∣porals, a Surgcon and three Drums; together with a hundred and fifty Muskets: All which was done by a hundred and ten of the <HI>English</HI> Foot, and thirty four Horse. With the Foot were Major <HI>Rider,</HI> Captain <HI>Nenny,</HI> Captain <HI>Dixy,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Barton,</HI> and Ensign <HI>Russel.</HI> With the Horse were Cornet <HI>Joshua,</HI> Cornet <HI>Haslington,</HI> Adjutant <HI>Robinson,</HI> and Quarter-Master <HI>Cadford,</HI> who with their Men, both Horse and Foot, behaved themselves with an extraordinary Bravery; gaining so considerable a Victory over above six times their number, with the loss only of Adju∣tant <HI>Robinson,</HI> one Corporal, and two Foot-Souldiers kill'd out∣right, and one Trooper wounded.</P>
<P>The same day this memorable Action was performed; a Party of Collonel <HI>Brewer</HI>'s Men were going from <HI>Mullingar</HI> towards <HI>Kinnagan;</HI> at what time a Serjeant and four Souldiers lagging a good way behind, were surpriz'd and murther'd by the <HI>Rap∣parees;</HI> only one escap'd, whom they left for dead, and whose Eyes they had most barbarously pick'd out with a Skean.</P>
<P>But the next Day, being the 6th of <HI>May,</HI> three <HI>Rapparees</HI> were taken, who being brought to <HI>Mullingar,</HI> one of them, whose Name was <HI>Ellis,</HI> gave Evidence against the other two, who were thereupon immediately hanged. The same day Captain <HI>Richard Poynts</HI> went out of <HI>Mullingar,</HI> with a hundred Men of that Gar∣rison, and falling upon a Party of <HI>Rapparees</HI> near <HI>Managhan,</HI> kill'd above forty; and Lieut. Coll. <HI>Hodson</HI> sallying out at the same time from <HI>Mountmelock,</HI> posted his Men over night at a Place call'd <HI>Isikapog;</HI> the morning by break of day, the Foot antred the Woods and Bogs, while the Horse scoured the shirts
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>of both; to the destruction of 18 of the <HI>Rapparee</HI> Vermin kill'd out-right, and several taken Prisoners, among whom was one <HI>O Rourk</HI> their Captain; who because he was notoricusly known to have committed several Robberies, was hang'd upon the Place. A fair satisfaction, in so short a time, for the Mur∣ther of the four <HI>Mullingar English,</HI> and digging out the Eyes of the fifth.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 8. The <HI>French</HI> Convoy arriv'd at <HI>Linner</HI>-Lake, with Pro∣vision, Cloaths and Ammunition, but neither Men nor Mony: The Sieur <HI>de</HI> St. <HI>Ruth,</HI> who is to command the Rebels, and two <HI>French</HI> Lieutenant-Generals, came over in the same Ships. And this was lookt upon like the pouring of Brandy down the Throat of a dying Man.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 11. A hundred and fifty of the <HI>Irish</HI> Army came to <HI>Castle-Lyons,</HI> and took away some Cattel from thence: But Coll. <HI>Donep</HI> being there with about 20 <HI>Danes,</HI> and 20 of the Militia-Dragoons, pursu'd the Enemy; at what time a Lieutenant of the <HI>Danes,</HI> with 8 Horse and 6 Dragoons, getting before the rest, and overtaking the Rebels at <HI>Ballyderrawne,</HI> beat off 60 from the Hedges which they had lin'd in that part, though with the loss of the Licutenant, who was there slain. But then the Collonel coming up with the rest of his Party, constrain'd the Rebels to run; and being reinforc'd with 50 Men out of the Regiments of Col∣lonel. <HI>Boyle,</HI> Collonel <HI>St. Leger,</HI> and Captain <HI>Barry</HI>'s Militia-Troops that lay posted at <HI>Formoy,</HI> they continu'd the pursuit a Mile an half beyond <HI>Kilworth,</HI> kill'd about 50, of which two were Commission-Officers, took 40 Horses, and several Silver-hilted Swords, Cloaths, Arms, and other Accoutrements, recover'd the Booty, and got about 30 Cows besides.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 14. The Lords Justices and Council set forth a Proclama∣tion, declaring, That all Popish <HI>Irish</HI> Inhabirants, where any <HI>Rap∣parees</HI> should commit any Robberies, Burnings or Murthers, or make any Insurrections, if they did not immediately give notice of such <HI>Rapparees</HI> and Insurrections, to the Justice of Peace or Military Officer next to their Habitations, and assist them in their taking of such <HI>Rapparees,</HI> and suppressing such Insurrections, should be deem'd Confederates with the Rebels, and Enemies to their Majesties Government, and be proceeded against with the utmost severity of Military execution. They farther order'd, That no protected <HI>Irish</HI> Papists should be out of their Houses after nine at Night, nor stir out of their Houses before four in the Morning,
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>upon pain of being put out of their Majesties Protection. And that after the 30th of <HI>May,</HI> if any Arms or Ammunition should be found in the possession of such <HI>Irish</HI> Papists, they should be lookt upon as Rebels, and punish'd accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 26. The Train of Artillery, consisting of 36 Pieces of Cannon, and 8 Mortars, set forward from <HI>Dublin,</HI> and upon the 30th arriv'd at the general Rendezvouz near <HI>Mullingar.</HI> The same day General <HI>Ginkle</HI> went from <HI>Dublin</HI> to the Army, ex∣pecting General <HI>Douglass</HI> to joyn him with 12000 Men from the North.</P>
<P>They who beheld the vast Preparations for this Campaign, had a fair prospect of their Majesties extream Care and Provi∣dence for the total Recovery of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and were easily convinc'd that the Publick Treasure was not now as formerly given for the Welfare, but expended for the Destruction of the Monarchy; parted with for the Honour of the Nation, but wasted upon Plea∣sure, while they beheld all the proper Ports of the Kingdom con∣tinually fill'd with Ships and Vessels, some transporting Money, others Recruits to the Army; while they beheld such amazing Quantities of Provision, Arms and Ammunition; 500 Draught-Horses at a time for the Carriages, and such other vast stores for the Artillery, with all other Necessaries for so great an Enter∣prize. Which shews the difference of a Nation's being under the Care of good Stewards, and from being under the negligent Mis∣government of Profuseness and unthrifty Prodigality.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Irish,</HI> they were as busie at the same time, as their Assistance would permit 'em: And certain information was given, That their new <HI>French</HI> General <HI>St. Ruth,</HI> issu'd out all his Or∣ders in the <HI>French</HI> King's Name, and requir'd several of the Rebel's Officers to take new Commissions under the <HI>French</HI> King, in prosecution of a Design of subjecting <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> that had been long carried on in that Kingdom by <HI>Abbot Gra∣velle,</HI> and of which his own Letters to a great Person in <HI>France,</HI> that have been since intercepted, are a sufficient Evidence.</P>
<P>But before we launch into the grand Campaign, there is this Observation to be made, That though these lesser Encounters which have been hitherto related, may seem to be of little value, yet considering the continu'd success of the <HI>English,</HI> though for the most part their Parties were much inferior to the Enemy, and the continu'd bad Fortune of the Rebels, such a Prosperity must needs be a great Encouragement to the one side, and no
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>small Disheartning to the other, not to have one smile of For∣tune in their Favor. Add to this, the picking up of so many of the Enemy for Hawks-meat, not suddenly taken notice of by a cursory Reading, was like a kind of Hectick Feaver, wasting their Body by degrees; which if the condition of the Kingdom would have endur'd it, must have consum'd the whole Bulk of the <HI>Irish</HI> Opposi∣tion at the long run. For most certainly it may be found by an easie computation, that in less than two Months before the Campaign open'd, the Rebels lost, by these petty Gleanings, 1079, Men kill'd out right, and above 230 Prisoners, in all 1309 Men, of which some were considerable Officers, and perhaps in the Number of the most experienc'd and daring Commanders; whereas about 40 was the utmost of the <HI>English</HI> loss; besides, that the ill <HI>Omen</HI> of being always beaten, makes a deep impression in the Minds of Men more couragious than the <HI>Irish.</HI></P>
<P>But now all things being in a readiness for the <HI>English</HI> to take the Field, General <HI>Ginkle,</HI> Commander in Chief of their Ma je∣sties Forces in the Kingdom in <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon the 6th of <HI>May,</HI> de∣camp'd from <HI>Mullingar;</HI> and being joyn'd the same day by Ge∣neral <HI>Douglass</HI> with the Northern Forces, which made up the whole Army 15 Battalions of Foot, and 3000 Horse, upon the 7th of <HI>May</HI> came before <HI>Ballymore,</HI> seated upon a tongue of firm Land, jetting out into a Lake, being in circumference about a Mile, ending on the two sides with Bogs that are unaccessible, which leave but a very streight Avenue from the main Land. The Enemy had fortified this place with two Retrenchments in the Winter, of which the first was a Horn-work, the second two whole Bastions, whose outward Curtains on each side extended down to the Lake; and within the last Retrenchment was an old <HI>Danish</HI> Mount, so fortified as that it made a third Retreat.</P>
<P>Upon the General's approach to the Town, the Marquiss <HI>de Rovigny</HI> was sent before with a strong Detachment of Horse and Dragoons, to possess himself of a Pass between the Town and <HI>Athlone;</HI> and as soon as the advanc'd part of the Army appear'd upon the Hills that look into the Fort, the Enemy began to play upon the <HI>English</HI> with two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield-Pieces, but without doing any harm. In the mean time a Detachment of Foot was sent to pos∣sess themselves of the Rebels out Posts, which they quitted upon the approach of the <HI>English,</HI> and ran as fast as they could into <HI>Ballymore;</HI> only a Serjeant and twelve Men continu'd firing out of a round Tower, and kill'd two of the <HI>English:</HI> But the
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>Tower soon after being taken by Assault, the Serjeant was hang'd upon a high Hill, in sight of the Enemy, for firing upon the Be∣siegers after the Communication was cut off from him and the Town. That Night the Besiegers raised five different Batteries; the first of 12 Pounders, the second of six 18 Pounders, to ruin the second Retrenchment; the third of 8 Field-Pieces to break the Pallisadoes; the fourth of four 18 Pounders, and two 12 Pounders, which batter'd the Horn-work; as also a Lodgment on the same side for three Mortar pieces. All which were brought to play the same Night. About eight of the Clock the next Mor∣ning, the General sent a Message to the Governour, <HI>That if he and the Garrison would surrender within two Hours, he would save their Lives, and receive 'em as Prisoners of War: If not, that they should expect no quarter.</HI> To which the Governor returning a shuffling fort of an Answer, in hopes to get better Terms, the Bat∣teries play'd on, and about Noon the Breaches of the first and second Retrenchments were so far advanc'd, and the Pallisado's so effectually cut down, that the General resolv'd to storm the Town in five several Places, on the Hornwork, and the two sides of the Bog by help of Faggots, and by that means to divide the Garrison, which consisted of 1000 Men. The Besiegers also had four large Wherries a float upon the Lake, which were brought from <HI>Dublin</HI> with a great deal of trouble, into which were put an hundred and fifty Granadiers, that at the time of the general Aslault, were to attack the Besieg'd on that side that lay open to the Lake. All which Preparations, and their own Condition, put them into so great a Consternation, that they hung out several white Flags; and about seven a Clock in the Evening, when they left off firing on both sides, the Governour Collonel <HI>Mich. Bourk,</HI> and several Officers came out, and submitted to the General's Mercy.</P>
<P>Upon the 9th of <HI>May</HI> the Garrison came forth, consisting of 780 Men, drawn out of the Enemies standing-Army, besides 4 Field-Officers, 16 Captains, 14 Lieutenants, 12 Ensigns and Cor∣nets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and 259 <HI>Rapparees,</HI> all well arm'd; who all laying down their Arms, were made Prisoners in the innermost part of the Fort. Besides the Garrison, there were above 600 Women and Children, among whom a Load of Ammunition-Bread was or∣der'd to be distributed. There was found in the Place several Sacks of <HI>French</HI> Oat-meal, about ten Barrels of Powder, with Shot proportionable in their Magazine, two Field pieces and about
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>three hundred Head of Cattel, and five hundred Sheep, which were given to the Souldiers.</P>
<P>The same Night that the Town surrendred, there was a hot Alarum that the Enemy was at hand, with a Body of 25000 Men; which occasion'd the Besiegers to double their Guards, and send out a strong Party of Horse and Foot toward <HI>Athlone,</HI> who within two Miles of that place, surpriz'd an advanc'd Guard of the Enemies asleep the main Body consisting of 1000 Men who retreated in safety, in regard the <HI>english</HI> had no Orders to ad∣vance any farther.</P>
<P>So soon as the Town was taken, the <HI>English</HI> fell to work in re∣pairing the Breaches, making some additions of new Works, and levelling the Batteries; and a Garrison was put into it of 500 Men: The Prisoners, being 51 Officers, and 900 Souldiers, were sent a∣way to <HI>Mullingar,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Dublin.</HI> After this, the General lay a while encamp'd near <HI>Ballymore,</HI> in expectation of the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> who upon the 4th of <HI>June</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Thurles,</HI> with the Forces under his Command, consisting of 12000 Horse and Foot.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 5. They came to <HI>Roscreagh,</HI> where they rested all the next day.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 7. They marched on to <HI>Bir;</HI> and upon <HI>June</HI> the 10th, continu'd their march, and came to <HI>Streanes</HI> Town the 14th, and upon the 18th joyn'd the General, six Miles farther in the way to <HI>Athlone.</HI></P>
<P>On the 18 of <HI>June,</HI> early in the Morning, the Army march'd from <HI>Ballymore;</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> having joyn'd the General, they encampt at <HI>Ballymore</HI>'s Pass; from whence a strong Detachment of Horse and Dragoons was fent to <HI>Ath∣lone.</HI></P>
<P>On the 19th the Army came before the Place, passing through many narrow Lanes, which might have cost a great many Men, had the Enemy as floutly defended 'em, as they might have done; and it seem'd a new sight, to behold none but <HI>French</HI> Colours in four parts of an <HI>Irish</HI> Garrison.</P>
<P>Upon the 20th of <HI>June,</HI> a Battery of ten 18 Pounders was fi∣nish'd, and began to play upon the Bastion near the Water side looking toward <HI>Lanesborough;</HI> and the Guns were so well directed, that by three of the Clock in the Afternoon, the whole Face, Flank, and part of the Curtain, was laid in Ruins; and thereupon the General gave Orders for an Assault to be made, which was per∣form'd
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>in this manner: First march'd 300 detach'd Granadiers, then 50 Pioneers with Bavins, next 200 Fuziliers, and then 2 Re∣giments of Foot, commanded by Brigadier <HI>Stewart;</HI> after which follow'd 200 Pioneers with more Bavins, and 20 Men with Felling-Axes, to cut away any Barricado of the Enemies they might meet in their way. All things being thus in a readiness, about six in the Evening the Sign was given, by a discharge of all the Cannon in Battery: Upon which, the <HI>English</HI> advanc'd in very good Or∣der to the Assault. The Enemy seem'd resolv'd at first to have maintain'd the Breach; but upon the first sight of the Hand-Granadiers, they fled, retiring in great consusion to <HI>Connaught</HI>-side, divers also leaping over the <HI>Shannon</HI> for haste: So that the <HI>English</HI> had nothing to do but to enter; which the whole Party did, and advanc'd to the Bridge; where lying open to the Ene∣mies shot from the other side, several of the <HI>English</HI> were kill'd and wounded, till the Enginiers had compleated some Blinds to cover them from the Town. In this Action however, not above 20 of the <HI>English</HI> were wounded, and some few slain out-right: In the number of the first was Brigadier <HI>Stewart,</HI> who was shot in the right Arm and in the Neck, but not dangerously; but Lieut. Coll. <HI>Gore,</HI> that led on the Granadiers, was shot at the Breach; and Lieutenant <HI>Kirk</HI> of <HI>Villiars</HI>'s Regiment, was unfortu∣nately kill'd by a Cannon-Ball, as he was viewing the Place from the top of a Hill that was just by.</P>
<P>On the 24th, a private Souldier seeing one of the Enemies Colours floating upon the River near the Bridge, threw himself into the Water; and though many shot were made at him, brought it off, and presented it to the General, who gave him a good Reward.</P>
<P>And thus one part of the Town being taken, upon the 25th of <HI>June,</HI> the Batteries against the other part of it were all finish'd, and thirty two Pieces of Cannon, and six Mortars, planted upon 'em, which play'd upon the Castle and the Enemies Works, on the other side of the River, with great success.</P>
<P>The 27th at Night the Souldiers wrought hard to repair the Stone-Bridge, of which two Arches were broken down by the Ene∣my: One of them was quite made up, and the other almost fini∣shed, when early next Morning the Enemy pull'd away some of the Planks, and threw them into the River; which made the <HI>English</HI> resolve to carry on a close Gallery upon the Bridge; which being done accordingly, Orders were given for storming
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>the Place on the 29th, at seven in the Morning; but before all things were in a readiness for it, a small Party of the Enemy came out, and set fire to the Gallery, though with the loss of most of their Lives. This Accident occasion'd the deferring the Assault till the next day. In the mean time the Cannon and Bombs continually play'd upon the Town and Castle, doing most terrible execution. However, the success the Enemy had in burning the Gallery, gave them so great assurance, that they did not expect to be so soon attackt.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, all things being in a readiness, in pursuance of the Orders given by General <HI>Ginkle,</HI> upon <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 30th of <HI>June,</HI> about four a Clock in the Afternoon, the Attack was made by 1500 Granadiers, and 6 Battalions of Foot standing ready to sup∣port 'em, if occasion should be. The Signal was the ringing of the <HI>Church bell,</HI> upon which the Granadiers (with whom M.G. <HI>Talmash,</HI> tho' he did not Command that day, went along as a Voluntier) entred the Ford, which was the only Passage the Assailants had, in regard the Bridge was so broken, that they could not get over it. The Enemy at first fired very smartly, but the Assailants, who waded up to their Breasts in Water with continual <HI>Huzzaing,</HI> ad∣vanc'd under the shelter of their own Cannon; and throwing their Granadoes, forc'd the Enemy from their Posts and Tren∣ches; and in less than half an hours time, made themselves en∣tirely Masters of the Town, with all their Enemies Works and the Ruins of the Castle. Major-General <HI>Maxwel,</HI> with several other Officers, and 200 common Souldiers, were taken Priso∣ners; and between 1000 and 1200 were kill'd upon the Place, besides Officers of note, such as were Brigadier <HI>Mackelicuddy,</HI> Collonels <HI>Mac-Mahoon, O Neale, O Gara,</HI> Lieut Collonels <HI>Mac∣genis</HI> and <HI>Barnwel;</HI> and Maj. <HI>Murray,</HI> Coll. <HI>Grace,</HI> being slain the day before: The rest escap'd over the Ramparts, and fled to the Enemies Camp; from whence some Battalions were coming to their Relief; but meeting with the Fugitives, and receiving a warm Salute from those very Works that were so very lately their own, they retreated back to their Camp.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>English</HI> were about 20 slain, and 30 wounded; while all, both Officers and Souldiers, behav'd themselves beyond an ordi∣nary Imagination, and perhaps beyond the Parallel of many Histo∣ries, where so much Bravery of Enterprize is rarely to be found, for only 3000 Men to assail a fortified Town, cross a River, and make themselves Masters of it in so short a time, in the very
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>face and view of the Enemy; an Action, with which only the Taking of <HI>Buda</HI> can stand in competition: Particularly the Ma∣jor-Generals <HI>Teteau</HI> and <HI>Mackay,</HI> Brigadier <HI>de la Meloniere,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Hesse-Dermstadt,</HI> who conducted the Attack; the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> Major-General <HI>Talmash,</HI> Count <HI>Nassau,</HI> and Brigadier <HI>Bellasis,</HI> merited lasting Honour, in contributing so greatly as they did, by their Conduct and Courage, to the good success of so signal an Atchievment. There were in the Town six Pieces of Brass Cannon, and two Mortars; but the stores of Powder, Bullet and Provisions, were but small. The Town and Castle were reduc'd to a heap of Ruins; and the Pri∣soners said, That before the Attack, there were kill'd in the Town about 1200 Men, by the Besiegers Cannon and Bombs, of which, nor of their Bullets or Stones, the Assailants were no Niggards, as having bestow'd upon the Place, before it was taken, 10000 Bullets, 600 Bombs, and several Tun of Stones.</P>
<P>The Town being thus reduc'd, the Enemy decamp'd in the Night-time, between the 30th of <HI>June,</HI> and 1st of <HI>July,</HI> and re∣treated ten Miles off, to a Place call'd <HI>Bally-Nash,</HI> where they lay with the River <HI>Soke</HI> before 'em, giving out that they design'd to stand a Battel: In pursuance of which Resolution, they at the same time quitted <HI>Slego, James</HI>-Town, and <HI>Lanesborough,</HI> in so much haste, that they left their Powder and great Guns behind 'em.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>July</HI> General <HI>Ginkle</HI> pass'd the <HI>Shannon</HI> at <HI>Ath∣lone;</HI> the Foot over a Bridge of Boats below the Town, the Horse and Artillery over the Stone-Bridge; and that Night they encamp'd about five Miles from <HI>Athlone.</HI></P>
<P>The 11th they march'd, and encampt on the left side of <HI>Ballinaslow,</HI> upon the River <HI>Suc,</HI> with in three Miles of the Enemy, who lay very advantagiously encampt at <HI>Aghriam,</HI> their left Wing stretching out toward <HI>Kilkon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el</HI> Abby, and their right upon <HI>Rilcommodon</HI>-Hills: Before them lay two Bogs, between which, the Road leads to <HI>Galloway.</HI> On their left lay the Ruins of an old Castle, which was entrench'd and lin'd with Foot; and on their right they had made several Entrenchments for the security of their Camp.</P>
<P>On the 14th, in the Morning, the Army march'd from <HI>Bal∣linaslow,</HI> and by eleven a Clock had pass'd the River <HI>Suc,</HI> the Horse at two Fords, and the Foot over the Stone-Bridge: Where after some skirmishing, the <HI>English</HI> drove in the Enemies out-Guards,
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>and the left Wing of their Majesties Army drew beyond the Bog, which cover'd the Enemies right Wing, and made room for the Foot to advance between that and them. In the mean time, the <HI>English</HI> Cannon had dislodg'd the Rebels Horse, from the end of the narrow Lane that leads to <HI>Aghriam,</HI> and the Kings Horse and Foot took up their Post there, still pouring over Men into a small spot of firm Land, that lay between the two Bogs and the old Castle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Enemy drew down great Bodies of Horse and Foot upon the left Wing of the <HI>English,</HI> and were so strongly posted behind the high Banks that lay one behind a∣nother, that the Foot had a very warm dispute with the Rebels for two hours, but at last forc'd 'em to give ground, notwithstan∣ding new Supplies both of Horse and Foot were still sent by the Rebels to relieve and second those that gave way. At the same time also three Battalions of <HI>English</HI> Foot advanc'd on the right hand, over the skirt of the Bog, and a little River that supplies the <HI>Suc,</HI> into a Corn-Field, where they were warmly entertain'd by several of the Enemies Battalions and Squadrons. However, the <HI>English</HI> maintain'd their ground till more Regiments came to their assistance; and forcing the-Enemy to retreat, gave time for the right Wing of Horse to come on, who immediately charg'd up the Hills upon the Squadrons of the Enemy; at what time the left Wing of the <HI>English</HI> having beaten the <HI>Irish</HI> from their ground, and the Right pressing hard upon 'em at the same time, put 'em into an absolute Rout.</P>
<P>The Victors pursu'd the flying Rebels about four Miles; for Night would not permit 'em to do it any farther, in regard it was six a Clock in the Afternoon before both Armies engag'd, and eight in the Evening before the Enemy was absolutely routed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Irish</HI> were never known to fight with more Resolution, especially the Foot; besides, that the Rebels were much superior to the <HI>English</HI> in number, being no less than 20000 Foot, and 8000 Horse and Dragoons, with all the Advantage moreover imaginable, that the Situation of the Ground could afford 'em However, the superiour Valour and Conduct of the <HI>English</HI> was such, as surmounted all those Disadvantages, and wrested a com∣pleat Victory out of the hands of an Enemy more stubborn than had been known for some Ages in that Kingdom. But it was the last Effort, <HI>pro Aris &amp; Focis,</HI> wherein the gasping Honour of the
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>Choice of all the Catholick Nobility and Gentry of the King∣dom strugled to do its utmost.</P>
<P>Of the Enemy 5000, or if you will believe Major-General <HI>Do∣rington,</HI> who was one of the Prisoners, 8000 were slain upon the Place; among whom was the <HI>French</HI> General <HI>St. Ruth,</HI> who was slain by a Cannon Bullet; the Lord <HI>Galloway,</HI> Coll. <HI>Barker,</HI> Coll. <HI>Moore,</HI> and Coll. <HI>Baggot,</HI> with several others.</P>
<P>The Prisoners of note were Maj. Gen. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Tate,</HI> Lord <HI>Bellew,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Gourdon O Neale,</HI> Lieut. Coll. <HI>Ro∣berts</HI> wounded.</P>

<P>Trophies of Honour were also taken, 12 Standards, 30 Colours, and one Kettle-Drum; with which the Lord <HI>O Bryan</HI> was sent into <HI>England,</HI> to present 'em to the Queen.</P>
<P>Add to this, That never better Conduct nor Gallantry was ever shewn, than among the General Officers; never more Bravery and Resolution seen among private Souldiers, who, with a sur∣prizing Courage and undaunted Fury, prest on, beat down all before 'em, and forc'd the Enemy from their advantagious Posts and Entrenchments, to make way for Victory and a glorious Triumph, with the loss of no more than 500 slain, and 700 wounded. Of the number of the slain were Maj. Gen. <HI>Holtstaple,</HI> Coll. <HI>Charles Herbert,</HI> first taken Prisoner at the beginning of the Fight, and afterwards inhumanly murther'd by the Rebels when they saw the Battel lost; Coll. <HI>Mongatz</HI> of the <HI>Danes,</HI> Maj. <HI>Petit</HI> of <HI>Bel-Castle</HI>'s Regiment, Maj. <HI>Devenish</HI> of <HI>Earle</HI>'s, Maj. <HI>Colt</HI> of <HI>Brewer</HI>'s, Maj. <HI>Cornwal</HI> and Maj. <HI>Fox,</HI> of <HI>Fouke</HI>'s, with divers in∣seriour Officers. Among the wounded were the Prince of <HI>Hesse-Dermstadt,</HI> the Lord <HI>George Hamilton,</HI> the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> Coll. <HI>Earle,</HI> Lieut. Coll. <HI>Brudenell,</HI> with some others.</P>
<P>After the Battel was over, the General encampt where the <HI>wish</HI> lay, and the next day, being the 13th of <HI>June,</HI> sent away
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>Brigadier <HI>Eppinger</HI> with a Detachment of 1200 Horse Horse and Dragoons, to seize <HI>Portumney,</HI> where the Rebels had a great Ma∣gazine of Provisions, who soon possess'd himself of it; and the next day, being the 14th, the Fort and Castie of <HI>Banaker</HI> surren∣dred to Major <HI>Wood;</HI> whereby the <HI>English</HI> became Masters of all the Passes upon the <HI>Shannon,</HI> except <HI>Limerick,</HI> and those within eight Miles of it.</P>
<P>Upon the 17th of <HI>July</HI> the Army advanc'd to <HI>Loghreah,</HI> and from thence upon the 19th to <HI>Athenree,</HI> where the General left about 3000 Horse, under the Command of Lieutenant-General <HI>Scravenmore,</HI> and Major-General <HI>Rovigny,</HI> to observe the Ene∣mies motion, but more especially to secure the free Passage of the Convoys and great Guns; and from thence advanc'd to <HI>Gal∣loway.</HI></P>
<P>So soon as the General came before the Place, he sent a Trumpet to the Lord <HI>Dillon,</HI> Governour of the Town, and of∣fer'd him the Benefit of the Lords Justices Proclamation of the 7th of <HI>July,</HI> in case he surrondred before the Cannon were brought to fire upon the Garrison. His Answer was, <HI>That Mon∣sieur</HI> d'Ussone, <HI>who Commanded, was of the same Opinion with him and the rest of the Officers, and that they resolv'd to defend the Place to the last.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, the <HI>English</HI> immediately made their Approaches, and the next day, being the 20th, by break of day, the Besiegers attack'd a Fort upon a Hill, which commanded a Valley between the Town and them. The Granadiers that were drawn out for this Action, march'd with that silence, that they got to the soot of the <HI>Glacis,</HI> before they were discover'd by the Enemy; at what time delivering their Granadoes, they went on directly to the Pallisadoes, and entred the Fort without opposition, and made themselves Masters of it without the loss of one Man, the Enemy crying out for Quarter, which was readily granted.</P>
<P>Immediately the <HI>English,</HI> having thus taken the Fort, en∣trench'd themselves in the Valley; at what time the General hea∣ring that <HI>Baldarick O Donnel</HI> was on his march, in order to throw himself and and his Brigade into the Place, the Tin-Boats were immediately launch'd in the River, and six Regiments of Foot and four of Horse sent over the River, and posted full in the way where <HI>Baldarick</HI> was to pass: Who finding it impossible for him to bring about his Design, retreated with his Rabble into the Country of <HI>Mayo,</HI> burning and destroying all before him.
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>The taking this Fort, and crossing over the River so sudden∣ly, may well be thought to have frighted the Enemy into a Treaty; for upon the 21st, about ten in the Morning, the Go∣vernour sent for a safe Conduct for some Persons he intended to send to the General, in order to a Capitulation: Which being granted, three Lieurenant Collonels came forth as Hostages, in the Afternoon. The Treaty lasted the rest of the day and night, at what time the Commissioners were ublig'd to go back, and consult their Superior Officers. But at last it was agreed,</P>
<P>That the next <HI>Sunday,</HI> being the 26 of <HI>July,</HI> in the Morning, the Town should be deliver'd to such Officers as the General should appoint; and that in the mean time five Hostages should be deliver'd to the Besiegers, for due performance of Articles; and that all the Out-works of the Town should be put into their hands.</P>
<P>That the Enemy should forbear to fortifie in the mean time, and withdraw all their Cannon from the Walls; but that the Besiegers should be permitted to work and post themselves where they would, provided they came not within three yards of the Wall, nor planted any Cannon upon the Battery they made.</P>
<P>That the Garrison and Townsmen that remain'd behind, should have the Benefit of the Lords Justices Proclamation, which gives them their Estates and Liberties.</P>
<P>That they who had a mind to depart, should be conducted safe to <HI>Limerick,</HI> with their Arms, Drums beating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with six Pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>Lastly, That they shall have the liberty to send to the Lord <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> to acquaint him with what they had done, and per∣swade him to do the same at <HI>Limerick.</HI></P>
<P>According to this Capitulation, they sent the Lord <HI>Clanriccard,</HI> and four Officers more, for Hostages, and allow'd two Persons appointed by the General, to enter into the Place, and take an account of the Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus upon the 26th of <HI>July</HI> was the City of <HI>Galloway</HI> actually surrendred, the Garrison marching out in the Morning, and <HI>a'Ʋssone,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Lieutenant-General, departing the Town two or three hours before the rest, as it were <HI>Incognito;</HI> being a Civi∣lity desired by the Monsieur, and with no less Generosity allow'd by General <HI>Ginkle;</HI> who as soon as the Town was clear of the Rebels, put into it three Regiments of Foot, under the Command <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sir <HI>Henry Bellasis.</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15"/><HI>Galloway</HI> being thus reduc'd, upon the 28th of <HI>July,</HI> the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Army set forward from thence toward <HI>Portumney,</HI> where the great Cannon for Battery was to meet them from <HI>Athlone:</HI> And there it was that the General receiv'd advice, That Captain <HI>Coale,</HI> with a Squadron of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, and the Provision and Ammunition-Ships from <HI>Kinsale,</HI> was arriv'd be∣fore <HI>Galloway;</HI> upon which, the General order'd him imme∣diately to sail away for the <HI>Shannon.</HI> From <HI>Athernee,</HI> the Army advanc'd to <HI>Banabar</HI>-Bridge, where they were joyn'd by seven Regiments more that lay Quarter'd in those parts; and while the General stay'd there, a great number of Draught-Horses were taken up, in order to carty Provision and Ammunition to the Camp. At the same time also, several Deserters came from the Enemy; who gave an account, That the <HI>French</HI> that were in <HI>Limerick,</HI> had been endeavouring to get off a Night or two be∣fore; but perceiving several <HI>English</HI> Ships in the mouth of the River, they return'd back again. They further inform'd, that there were above twenty Merchant Ships and two Privateers, all laden and bound for <HI>France.</HI> Whereupon Orders were sent to Cap∣tain <HI>Coale,</HI> who commanded the Squadron then lying in the <HI>Shan∣non,</HI> to take care to secure those Vessels, and prevent their get∣ting out.</P>
<P>Upon the 3d of <HI>August,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> decampt from <HI>Banabar,</HI> and the same day Brigadier <HI>Leveson,</HI> with 500 Horse and Dra∣goons, got before, and in the Evening came to <HI>Nenagh;</HI> upon whose approach, the Governour, Brigadier <HI>Carroll</HI> quitted the Place in great haste, having first set it on fire; which, however, it was soon put out, by eleven of the <HI>English,</HI> who hapned to be Prisoners there, and were left behind.</P>
<P>On the 6th of <HI>August,</HI> Collon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <HI>Mitchelhourn</HI> having block'd up <HI>Slego</HI> on both sides, the Governour Sir <HI>Teague O Regan,</HI> sub∣mitted to a Capitulation, and sign'd Articles the same day, to surrender the Town by the 15th next ensuing. But afterwards, out of that same treacherous Inconstancy, natural to the meer <HI>Irish,</HI> he refused to yield upon the Capitulations he had sign'd. So that a more numerous Force was drawn out, and sent away to joyn with 3000 of the <HI>Militia,</HI> to bring him to another sort of Re∣pentance.</P>
<P>At the same time also <HI>Baldaric O Donnel,</HI> sormerly a Collonel in <HI>Spain,</HI> and said to be the true Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> whose Name has hitherto made a great Noise among the superstitious <HI>Irish,</HI> that pin their Faith upon Prophecies, sent to the General a Proposal
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>of some Conditions which he desired might be granted to him and his Followers, upon their laying down their Arms; and that for the present, an Article for a Cessation might be allow'd him, for continuing unmolested with his Men, in some place to be assign'd him, till their Majesties Pleasure should be known con∣cerning his Demands.</P>
<P>Upon the 7th or 8th of <HI>August,</HI> the <HI>Militia</HI> of the County of <HI>Cork</HI> made an Incursion into the Rebels Quarters, beyond <HI>Ban∣try,</HI> under the Command of Collonel <HI>Beecher,</HI> and Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Moore;</HI> who in their march to joyn with Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Freek,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Roberts,</HI> Major <HI>Wade,</HI> and Major <HI>Morris,</HI> met with a Body of the Enemy, consisting of 400 Men, near <HI>Skibberteine,</HI> which they presently defeated, kil∣ling above 60, and taking several Prisoners. Which done, they joyn'd the rest of the Party; and making up 500 in all, march'd toward a place where they were inform'd that <HI>Mac-Car∣ry Moore,</HI> and <HI>O Danavan,</HI> lay with their Regiments; and with great difficulty got over a Pass, which the Rebels might have defended with 20 Men, against 2000. Which put the Ene∣my into such a Consternation, that they betook themselves to their Heels, in so great a confusion, that they left behind, for a Prey to the <HI>English,</HI> a thousand Head of Black Cattle, five hun∣dred Garrans, as many Goats, two thousand Sheep, and store of other Booty.</P>
<P>Much about the same time, a Vessel, on board of which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>St. Ruth</HI>'s Goods and Plunder, attempting to get out of the <HI>Shan∣non,</HI> was taken by one of their Majesties Frigats that was cruiz∣ing about the Mouth of the River; at what time two other Ships, in which were <HI>Sarsfield</HI>'s Lady, and some other Persons of Quality, observing, as good luck for them would have it, the Misfortune of the first Vessel, return'd back to <HI>Limerick.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 11th of <HI>August,</HI> the General march'd from <HI>Nenagh</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Shadey,</HI> about two Miles from the Silver Mines. The next day he advanc'd to <HI>Tullen,</HI> and upon the 14th, to <HI>Caricken-Lysh,</HI> which is about four Miles from <HI>Limerick.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 15th, the General went with 1500 Horse and Dra∣goons, within sight of the Town; and having beaten in the Ene∣mies out Guards, took a view of the Rebels Works, from the Hills where their Majesties Artillery was lodg'd the last Year.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>
<P>On the 16th, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> who depar∣ted this Life the <HI>Friday</HI> before, as it was certainly said, out of meer Anguish of Mind, to see the ruinous Condition of his Ma∣ster's Affairs, was buried at <HI>Limerick;</HI> who being thus laid in his Grave, a Commission was produc'd from the late King, which Mr. <HI>Plowden,</HI> formerly one of the Commissioners of the Revenue in <HI>Ireland,</HI> had brought but a little before from <HI>France,</HI> appoine ting Sir <HI>Alexander Fitton,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Neagle,</HI> and the said Mr. <HI>Plowden,</HI> Justices of <HI>Ireland;</HI> who immediately, by virtue of the same Commission, took upon 'em to act, within the narrow Confines of <HI>Limerick,</HI> as Lords Justices of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>At the same time Collonel <HI>Henry Lutterell</HI> had been seiz'd by order of the <HI>French</HI> Lieut. gen. <HI>d'Ʋssone,</HI> for having made some Proposals for a Surrender; and was sentenc'd, by a Court-Martial, to be shot to Death. Of which General <HI>Ginckle</HI> being inform'd, sent word to the <HI>French</HI> Monsieur by a Trumpet, That if any Man were put to death for having a Mind to come over to the <HI>English,</HI> he would revenge it double upon the <HI>Irish</HI> Prisoners.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 25. The <HI>English</HI> Army drew near <HI>Limerick,</HI> and drove the Enemy from all their several Forts and Places of defence with∣out the Town; of which they quitted some upon the approach of the <HI>English.</HI> Nevertheless, in another Fort which they had new∣ly built, and wherein they had six hundred Men, they made a shew of greater Resistance; but upon the advance of fourscore Granadiers to attack it, they only gave one general discharge up∣on 'em, and then made a running Retreat by a Covert-way, within their Flank Lines, which they had newly raised round about the Town.</P>
<P>The next Morning, a considerable Detachment of Horse and Foot was sent away, with some Cannon, under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Hesse-Dermstadt,</HI> to take in <HI>Castle-Connel,</HI> where the Enemy had a strong Garrison: And another Party was sent to reduce three other Castles, in the Enemies possession, that lay upon the River below the Town.</P>
<P>Upon the 25th of <HI>August,</HI> the whole Army decamping from <HI>Carrick-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>glish,</HI> about three in the Afternoon came before <HI>Lime∣rick,</HI> the left Wing reaching to the River; but in regard the Enemy had planted two Pieces of Cannon on the other side of the River, to the Disadvantage of the <HI>English,</HI> a Regiment of Dra∣goons, and another of Horse, that were posted: nearest to the Banks of the Stream, were constrain'd to remove to a little far∣ther
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>distance out of Harm's way. Being thus come before the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Town, the <HI>English</HI> advanc'd to <HI>Cromwel</HI> Fort, without any oppo∣sition, the Enemy quitting both that and the Line of Commu∣nication, which they had made to the Church, and retreating to their Intrenchments that were nearer the Town. And at the same time, a Derachment of fourscore Granadiers were imme∣diately order'd to attack one of their Out-works, which was a new Fort, and guarded by six hundred Men; which upon the advancing of the <HI>English,</HI> they abandon'd after one single dis∣charge, and fled by the Covert-way into the Town. Upon which, the Granadiers entred the Fort; and pursuing the Fugi∣tives, kill'd several, and took about twenty Prisoners, with the loss of no more than one Man. Only one unhappy Accident sell out that night, that Collonel <HI>Donep</HI> of the <HI>Danish</HI> Horse, was un∣fortunately slain by a Random-shot.</P>
<P>The 26th the heavy Cannon and Mortars arriv'd, and the Souldiers began to work upon the Lines of Communication.</P>
<P>The 27th a Battery was raised by the Besiegers against <HI>Tho∣mond</HI> Bridge; and the same day Lieutenant-General <HI>Scraven∣more</HI> was sent with a Detachment to reduce <HI>Castle O Gunnel,</HI> which presently surrendred at discretion; so that the whole Garrison, consisting of a hundred and fifty Men, were all made Prisoners of War. At the same time some lighter <HI>English</HI> Frigats made up, and cast Anchor within sight of the Town, while Captain <HI>Cole</HI> with the rest of the Squadron lay about six Miles off. 'Tis said that the Besieged, upon the first appearance of the small Frigats, expressed an extraordinary Joy, believing them to have been <HI>French;</HI> but were as much appall'd, when they found their unlucky Mistake.</P>
<P>The 28th <HI>Castle-Connel</HI> surrendred to the Prince of <HI>Hesse-Derm∣stadt,</HI> which was attended with the surrender of several other petty Castles thereabout, and made the <HI>English</HI> Masters of above nine hundred Prisoners.</P>
<P>Upon the 30th the Besiegers began to play upon the Town with nine Mortars, which set it on fire in several places, though it burnt not very long, the Buildings being all of Stone, and very strong. However, the second Bomb that was thrown kill'd the Lady <HI>Dillon,</HI> and wounded several others. The next day nine Cannon began to play upon the Castle to ruin it, and to hin∣der the Enemies Communication with their Camp; and the same night was erected a Battery of two Mortars more, of eighteen
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>Inches diameter; and soon after two more Batteries were finish'd, one of fourteen Pieces, the other of ten, all carrying twenty four and eighteen pound Ball. The Report of all the Deserters, who daily came over to the Leaguer, at that time was, that the Gar∣rison in the Town was very numerous, but that they were not half arm'd, and that they were in great want of Previsions. But though it is not amiss for a General to hear what such People say, yet there is but little Credit to be given to their Reports, which are most frequently fram'd to curry favour. Thus in a few days after, other Deserters reported, That there were not Provisions in the Town for many days, and that <HI>d'Ʋssone</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Go∣vernour, had promised to dismiss the Militia that were forced in∣to the Town, after the Battel of <HI>Aghrim,</HI> if succour did not come from <HI>France</HI> in twelve days. Of the Truth of all which, an easie Conjecture may be made by what has hapned since.</P>
<P>However, after all these fair Stories, the General hearing that several Regiments of the Enemies Horse, with a Party of <HI>Rap∣parees,</HI> were drawn together in <HI>Kerry,</HI> about sixteen Miles from <HI>Limerick,</HI> sent away Brigadier <HI>Leveson</HI> with five hundred Horse and Dragoons, in pursuit of the whole Party; who being inform'd of his March, divided themselves into two Bodies, to make their retreat the more easie. Which Brigadier <HI>Leveson</HI> understanding, did the like; and with one part of his Detachment, himself pur∣sued one of the Enemies Bodies, while Collonel <HI>Newenhuys</HI> pur∣su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the other. Nor was it long before the Brigadier overtook the Party which he pursu'd; and so entirely put them to the rout, that very few escap'd; among the rest, the Lord <HI>Castle Con∣nel</HI> was taken, and sent to the Camp with the rest of the Pri∣soners.</P>
<P>Upon the 3d of <HI>September,</HI> the Enemies Horse quitted their Camp, under the Cannon of the Town, and betook themselves to another that lies in the Road between <HI>Limerick</HI> and <HI>Killalow;</HI> and thus their Horse being near to second 'em, they posted four Regiments of Dragoons to guard the Fords of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> in case the Enemy should attempt to pass the River. On the other side, the Besiegers had by this time finish'd their Line of Circum∣vallation, with four Redoubts to defend it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 4. Three hundred Horse and Dragoons were sent to re-inforce Brigadier <HI>Leveson;</HI> who after the Defeat of the two Regiments, and the Body of <HI>Rapparees,</HI> in <HI>Kerry,</HI> was advanc'd farther, in order to the reducing of those few small Garrisons
<PB N="31" REF="18"/>which the <HI>Irish</HI> had left in that County; to which purpose, is Pieces of Cannon were also order'd him for the more speedy ef∣fecting his Design.</P>
<P>About the same time, the <HI>Irish</HI> having put between 2 and 300 of the Protestant Inhabitants of <HI>Limerick</HI> into a little Island in the <HI>Shannon,</HI> under a sufficient Guard, their sad and starving Condition mov'd the Compassion of the Officers, to whose care they were committed; who being no less desirous themselves to go over to the <HI>English,</HI> sent to Maj. <HI>Stroud,</HI> who then lay posted with some of the <HI>Melitia</HI> not far from the Island, to let him understand their intentions; upon which, the Major went over with a Party in small Boats; and brought away not only the Guard, but the Pri∣soners, that were almost starv'd for want of Food, in a place where they had only two pitiful Hutts to shelter them from the Inconveniences of the Weather.</P>
<P><HI>Septemb.</HI> 8. The great Battery of 22 Pieces of Cannon began to play very early in the Morning, and in a short time made a Breach of about 30 yards in the <HI>English</HI> Town, on the North-East side of it. Upon the left of this Battery were also planted 8 Mor∣tars, two of which were 18 Inches in diameter. The next day, be∣ing the 9th, two more Batteries were finish'd, which play'd upon St. <HI>John</HI>'s Gate in the <HI>Irish Town.</HI> These Batteries and Mortars playing without intermission, made a world of Havock, dismoun∣ted the Enemies Cannon, made several Breaches, set the <HI>English Town</HI> several times on fire, and laid the greatest part of it in Rub∣bish; and all this by the 12th at night; at what time some of the Besiegers Bombs falling among the Enemies Stores, burnt three of their Magazines, one of Brandy, and the other two of Bisker, and shortly after fired and blew up another Magazine of Powder, which forc'd the Enemy to remove what Provisions and Am∣munition they had left, into the <HI>Irish Town.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Septemb.</HI> 15. The Lord <HI>Lisburn</HI> was kill'd by a Cannon Ball, as he was lying upon his Quilt in the Trenches.</P>
<P>On the 17. One Capt. <HI>Taffe</HI> came over to the <HI>English,</HI> and inform'd the General, that the <HI>English Town</HI> was utterly ruin'd; that the great Guns and Bombs had kill'd a great number of the Garrison, which at that time was reduc'd to 6000 Foot, and those but very ill clad.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>18th.</HI> an Express was sent to <HI>Dublin</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Granard,</HI> giving this Accompt, that upon his com∣ing before <HI>Slego</HI> with a Body of the Army, and Militia of the Country, consisting of about 3000 Men, to whom <HI>Baldaric
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>neale,</HI> who was absolutely come over to the <HI>English,</HI> had joyned his own Thou∣sand followers, the Irish quitted the Town, and retreated into the Fort; up∣on which his Lordship caus'd a Battery to be Rais'd against it. But then the Irish chusing rather to submit in time, then suffer the fatal Effects of a suc∣cessful Storm, surrender'd the Fort upon the <HI>15th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> and Marched out accordingly to the Number of between 5 or 600 Men. They left in the Place 16 Pieces of Cannon, 30 Barrels of Powder, more Shot in proportion, and a great Quantity of Provision. The Articles they obtain'd were almost the same with those that were granted to <HI>Galloway,</HI> wherein divers other pet∣ty Garisons were included, upon this Condition that they furrendr'd twenty four Hours after being Summon'd. Much about the same time, General <HI>Ginckle</HI> having determined that part of the Army should pass the <HI>Shannon,</HI> with a re∣solution to dissipate or remove the Irish Horse that lay Encamped in the Coun∣ty of <HI>Clare,</HI> and shut up the Town on that side also, the better to conceal his design, made a shew by giving Orders to draw off and ship the heavy Cannon, and quit several Castles near the Camp, as if he intended to raise the Siege; which the Enemy believing to be real, expressed their joy by loud and frequent∣ly repeated Shouts. But the same Night the <HI>Pontons</HI> were laid over the <HI>Shan∣non</HI> about a Mile above the Town; which was perform'd with that Order and Silence, that upon the <HI>16th.</HI> by break of day, the Royal Regiment of Dra∣goons, with a Detachment both of Horse and Foot had pass'd the River be∣fore they were discover'd by the Enemy. All this while Brigadier <HI>Clifford</HI> lay with four Regiments of Dragoons on the other side of the Water, to have hinder'd the <HI>English</HI> from getting over; and so soon as he perceiv'd himself frustrated in his design; brought down all his Men on foot (their horses being at grass) to make the best opposition he could. But they were presently routed, and forc'd to betake themselves to their Heels, flinging away their Arms, and leaving behind them all their Tents. Baggage, Saddles, Bridles and other Accoutrements, together with two Pieces of Cannon, and the Standard of <HI>Maxwell.</HI> Many were kill'd, and several taken Prisoners, among whom was a French Lieutenant Collonel. Upon this, the rest of the Irish Horse, that lay higher up towards <HI>Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lalow,</HI> took the <HI>Alarum,</HI> and drew out as if they had intended some stout resistance, but as it prov'd, 'twas only to secure their Baggage, and get time to take down their Tents. For so soon as the <HI>En∣glish</HI> drew near 'em, and had pass'd the first Lane that was between the Irish and Them, they March'd off in great disorder toward the Mountains. Which done, the Horse return'd to the Camp, and the Foot were posted at the head of the Bridge. At what time the <HI>English</HI> also took a Castle that stands in the Middle of the <HI>Shannon,</HI> the Garison of which consisting of about three-score Men, surrender'd at discretion; besides another Post not far from it which were of great Use to the Besiegers. The <HI>English</HI> also remov'd their Bridge of Boats nearer to the Town, and secur'd two more Passes to it, of which one was call'd the Pass of <HI>Annabegg,</HI> where the <HI>English</HI> went over the last year.</P>
<P>On the 22d. of <HI>September</HI> the General of the <HI>English</HI> passed the <HI>Shannon</HI> very early in the Morning with a strong Party of Horse and Dragoons, and Ten Regiments of Infantry, and fourteen Pieces of Cannon, leaving the rest of the Army under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Wittenbergh</HI> to secure the Be∣siegers Works on the other side of the River. About Noon the same day, both Horse and Foot were drawn up before the <HI>Irish</HI> Town, notwithstand∣ing that the Enemy play'd upon 'em all the while from the Castle, and seve∣ral Towers, both with their great Guns and small Shot. About four of the Clock in the Afternoon, the General Order'd all the Granadeers together with the Regiments of Collonel <HI>Kirk,</HI> Collonel <HI>Yiffin,</HI> and the Lord <HI>George Hamilton</HI> to Advance and Attack the Fort that secures <HI>Thomend</HI> Bridge; at what time the Besieged sent two great Detachments out of the Town, to re∣inforce
<PB N="32" REF="19"/>and second their own Party that defended it. But notwithstanding all this, the <HI>English</HI> went on with that Courage and Bravery, that they beat the Enemy from their Works, who thereupon fled to the Town in hopes to have been let in. But the Governour fearing least the Victorious <HI>English</HI> should have Enter'd with the fugitives, durst not let down the draw Bridge to receive them, which occasion'd a great slaughter of the vanquish'd Irish, so that nothing was to be seen from the foot or <HI>Thomond</HI> Bridge to the draw Bridge, but heaps of dead Bodies. Six hundred of the Enemy were slain, and about one handred and thirty raken Prisoners, among which Number was Collonel <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kelton</HI> (since dead of his wounds) two Lieutenant Collonels, two Majors, three Captains, seven Lieutenants and six Ensigns. The loss which the <HI>En∣glish</HI> sustain'd was occasion'd more by their own Contempt of Danger, and too eager pursuit of Victory, than the Resistance of the Enemy. For all the while the conflict endur'd, the Enemy play'd with their Great and Small Shot from the Walls of the Town at a more than ordinary Rate: which was the rea∣son that the Mettle of the <HI>English</HI> precipitating them too far, they were much more than they needed to have been, expos'd to the Enemies Fire: so that between two and three hundred were slain and wounded, tho not any one of Remark.</P>
<P>The next day in the Afternoon the Garison beat a Parley on both sides of the <HI>River,</HI> and desir'd a Truce, which was agreed upon by the General; which time being expir'd, <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and <HI>Wahop</HI> came forth, and desir'd the Truce might be continu'd for three days, to the End they might send to their Horse, which lay toward <HI>Clare,</HI> to know upon what Conditions they expected to be comprehend∣ed in the Capitulation.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>25th.</HI> Collonel <HI>Sheldon,</HI> and some other of the Enemies Officers came into the <HI>English</HI> Camp, and thence went into <HI>Limerick.</HI> The next Day <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsfield</HI> and <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hop</HI> din'd with the General; and the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> Sir <HI>David Collier,</HI> Collonel <HI>Tiffany</HI> and Collonel <HI>Fiper</HI> were sent as Hostages into the Town, and the Lords <HI>Westmeath, lveagh, Trimblestown</HI> and <HI>Lowth,</HI> remain'd in the Camp as Hostages for the Garison. Upon the <HI>27th.</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> sent out their Proposals, which the General not approving, instead of an Answer, sent back twelve other Articles, which was all he would allow them; and at the same time gave Orders for the great Guns and Mortars to be in a rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ness, in case they resas'd the Proposals he had sent; which brought down the Stomac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the <HI>Irish,</HI> who seeing the Resolution of the General and finding to other Remedy, at length, upon the third of this Month came to a final Conclusion, so that the Articles of Capitulation were signed the same Day, consisting of two Parts, the one relating to Civil Affairs, which were signed by the Lords Justices, the General, and the Persons deputed by the Garri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on; and the other in reference to the Military Affairs, which were subscribed by the Generals on both Sides, Such of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> as have a Mind to pass the Seas, are to have the Liberty, for their present Convenience, to stay in the <HI>English</HI> Town and the Island, till they can be ship'd away. And the Castles of <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Clare,</HI> together with all other Places and Castles that as yet are in the Possession of the <HI>Irish</HI> are by Vertue of the same Capitulation, to be forth with deliver'd up to the <HI>English.</HI> So that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urrender of this Town complents the Conquest of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In pursuance of the Agreement, one Gate of the Town was delivered up that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vening; it being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> late t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> march into the Town; but the next Day the <HI>Irish</HI> being quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out, the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in and took Possession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it with seven Reginments of Font. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> some others, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> design to re∣pair their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> themselves the more ac∣ceptable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> up some of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to go along with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may our next Journal attend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
