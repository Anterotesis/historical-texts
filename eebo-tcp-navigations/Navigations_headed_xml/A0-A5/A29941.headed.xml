<HEAD><HI>5.</HI> Why Cities were at first instituted.</HEAD>
<P>IN the time of <HI>William</HI> the Conque∣rour it is declared in these words, <HI>Item nullum mercatum vel forum sit, nec fieri permitratur nisi in Civitatibus regni nostri, &amp; in</HI> Burgis <HI>clausis, &amp; muro val∣latis &amp; Castellis, &amp; locis tutissimis, ubi con∣suetudines regni nostri, &amp; jus nostram commune: &amp; dignitates Coronae nostrae, quae constitutae sunt à bonis praedecessoribus de∣perire non possunt, nec defraudari, nec vi∣olari; sed omnia rite, &amp; per judicium, &amp; justitiam fieri debent: &amp; ideo Castella &amp;</HI> Burgi <HI>&amp; Civitates sunt &amp; fundatae, &amp; aedificatae,</HI> Sc. <HI>ad Tuitionem gentium, &amp; populorum regni, &amp; ad defensionem regni, &amp; idcirco observari debent cum omni li∣bertate, &amp; integritate, &amp; ratione.</HI></P>
<P>Out of this same Record we may pel∣lucidly and clearly collect, that Cities, Towns or Boroughs were instituted for three purposes. <HI>Sc.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7"/>First, <HI>Ad consuetudines regni nostri, &amp; jus nostrum commune &amp; dignitates coro∣nae conservand.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Ad Tuitionem gentium, &amp; populorum regni</HI>; and</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Ad Defensionem Regni</HI>; This in three particularities.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. For conservation of Lawes, whereby every man enjoyeth his own in peace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For Tuition and defence of the Kings Subjects, and for keeping the Kings peace in time of sudden up∣roars.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For defence of the Realm a∣gainst outward and inward Hostility.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Thus much out of our own Records, <HI>I</HI> now come to speak somewhat of this matter, that I have seen in foreign Authors.</P>
<P><HI>Tully</HI> sayes thus, <HI>Hanc ob Causam ma∣ximè, ut sua tenerentur Respublica &amp; Civitates constitutae sunt, nam etsi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>2.</HI> de Offic.</NOTE> <HI>duce natura, congregabantur homines, tamen spe Custodiae rerum suarum urbium praesi∣dia quaerebantur.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Pol.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>Civitas a natura pro∣fecta est, homo animal aptum est ad coetus proinde Civitatis Origo ad vivendum, in∣stitutio

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In Pol.

<P><HI>By</HI> these authorities, foreign and do∣mestick, it appears, that Cities, and Towns, were at the first invented, to the end that men might lead a civil Life amongst themselves, and be saved harmless against their Enemies.</P>

<P>Thus much for Cities and Towns in general. I now purpose to speak more particularly concerning the renowned City of <HI>London</HI>: in relation to which famous Metropolis, I shall presume to offer the Reader these particulars,</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the Origination or Etomology of the word <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TOuching the name of <HI>London,</HI> from what occasion the City should be so denominated, divers Authors conceit di∣versly.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that <HI>London</HI> took the name of <HI>Ludstone</HI>; for King <HI>Lud</HI> not onely repaired this City, but also increas∣ed the same with fair buildings, Towers, and Walls, and after his own name, cal∣led it <HI>Cair Lud, i. e.</HI> the Town of <HI>Lud,</HI> and the strong Gate, which he erected, in the west part of the City, he likewise for their own honour and reputation na∣med it <HI>Ludgate.</HI></P>
<P>Others say, it is so called from the word <HI>Llhwn</HI>; for seeing <HI>Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Stra∣bo</HI> do write, that the ancient Britains cal∣led those woods, and Groves by the names of Cities, and Towns which they had fenced with Trees, cast down and plashed, to stop up the passage; and see∣ing that such VVoods or Groves are in the Brittish tongue named <HI>Llhwn,</HI> they are in inclined to the opinion, that <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
thence took name, as one would say, by way of excellency, the City, or a Ci∣ty thick of Trees.</P>
<P>Again, Others are of opinion (which seemeth to be the most probable) that whence <HI>London</HI> had the same, there also it took the name, even from Ships which the Brittains in their dialect call <HI>Longh</HI>; so that <HI>Londinum</HI> may seem to sound as much as a Ship Road, or City of Ships: for the Brittains term a City <HI>Dinas,</HI> whence the the Latines have fetch'd their <HI>Dinum.</HI> And hence it is, that elsewhere it is cal∣led <HI>Longidinum,</HI> and in the Funeral Song of a most ancient Brittish Poet, <HI>Llong Porth,</HI> that is an Harbour or Haven of Ships: And by this very term <HI>Bononia,</HI> or <HI>Bolea</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calleth <HI>Gessori∣acum Novale,</HI> in the Brittish Glossary is named <HI>Bolung-Long.</HI> For many Cities have drawn their names from Ships, as <HI>Naupactus, Naustathmas, Nauplia, Nava∣lia Augusti,</HI> &amp;c. But of these none hath better right indeed to assume unto it the name of a Ship Road or Haven, than our <HI>London,</HI> as you shall understand at after. See more of this business in <HI>Hollinshead, Stow, Geoffry</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and <HI>Camb∣den.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>Stow</HI> in his Survey of <HI>London</HI> saith, that as the Romans to glorifie the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> drew the original thereof from gods, and Demy-gods, by the Trojan Progeny: So <HI>Geoffry</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the Welsh Historian, deduceth the founda∣tion of this famous City of <HI>London,</HI> for the greater glory thereof from the very same original. For he reporteth, that <HI>Brute,</HI> lineally descended from the Demy-god <HI>Aeneas,</HI> the Son of <HI>Venus,</HI> Daugh∣ter of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> about the year of the World 2855, and 1108 before the Na∣tivity of Christ, builded this City near unto the River now called <HI>Thames,</HI> and named it <HI>Troynovant,</HI> or <HI>Trenovantes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Of the Walls belonging to this renowned City.</HEAD>
<P>TOuching the Walls of <HI>London</HI> there are three things worthy of your Observation, <HI>scil.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The First Founder of them. <HI>Sime∣on</HI> of <HI>Durham,</HI> an ancient Writer, re∣porteth, that <HI>Hellen</HI> the Mother of <HI>Con∣stantine</HI> the Great, was the first that in∣walled this City, about the year of Christ, 306.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the City was walled round about by the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> as ap∣pears by <HI>William Fitz Stephen,</HI> who wri∣ting in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> 2. and writing of the Walls of this City, hath these very words. <HI>Muro Urbis alto &amp; magno, duplatis Heptapylae portis inter con∣tinuante, turrito ab Aquilone per inter cape∣dines. Similiter{que} ab Austo</HI> Londonia <HI>murata, &amp; Turrita fuit; sed fluvius maximus piscosus</HI> Thamensis, <HI>mari influo, refluo{que} qui illic allabitur, maenia illa tra∣ctu temporis alluit, labefactavit, dejecit</HI>: The Wall is high, and great, well tow∣red
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>
on the North side, with due distan∣ces between the Towers. On the South∣side also the City was walled, and tow∣red, but the fishful River of <HI>Thames</HI> with his ebbing, and flowing, hath long since subverted hem.</P>
<P N="3">3. The circuit of the wall on the Lands side. <HI>Stow</HI> tells us, that the circuit of the wall of <HI>London</HI> on the Lands side, to wit, from the Tower of <HI>London</HI> in the East, unto Aldgate is 82. perches: from Aldgate to Bishopsgate, 86. perches: from Bishopsgate, to the postern of Criplegate 162. perches: from Criplegate to Aldersgate, 75. perches: from Aldersgate to Newgate 66. per∣ches: from Newgate to Ludgate, 42. perches, in all 573. perches of Assize. From Ludgate to the Fleet-Dike, west, about 60. perches: from Fleete-Bridge South to the River <HI>Thames,</HI> about 70. perches; and so the total of these perches amounteth to 643. every perch consisting of 5. yards, and a halfe, which do yield 3536. yardes, and a half, containing 10608. foot, which make up two English miles, and more by 608. foot.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. Of the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TOuching the River of <HI>Thames</HI> ac∣cept the writings of <HI>Cambden', Stow,</HI> and of one that wrote in defence of this famous City.</P>
<P><HI>Cambden</HI> sayes, that in regard of both Elements most blessed and happy is <HI>London,</HI> as being scituate in a rich and fertile soyl, abounding with plentiful store, of all things, and on the gentle ascent and rising of an hill, hard by the <HI>Thames</HI> side, the most mild merchant, as one would say, of all things, that the world doth yield; which, swelling at certain set houres, with the Ocean Tides, by his safe and deep Channel, able to entertain the greatest ships that be, daily bringeth in so great Riches from all parts, that it striveth at this day with the Mart-Towns of Christendome for the second prize, and affordeth a most sure, and beautiful road for shipping.</P>
<P><HI>Stow</HI> sayes thus of <HI>Thames; Thames</HI> the most famous River of this Island, be∣ginneth a little above a village called <HI>Winchcombe</HI> in <HI>Oxford</HI> Shire, and still
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
increasing passeth first by the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and so with a marvellous quiet course to <HI>London,</HI> and thence breaketh into the French Ocean by main Tides; which twice in 24. hours space doth ebbe and flow, more then 60. miles in Length to the great com∣modity of Travellers, by which all kind of Merchandize be easily conveyed to <HI>London,</HI> the principal store house, and staple of all Commodities within this Realm, so that omitting to speak of great Ships, and other Vessels of Bur∣then, there pertaineth to the Cities of <HI>London, Westminster,</HI> and the Borough of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> above the number, as is supposed of 2000. Wherries, and other small boats, whereby 3000. poor people at the least be set on work, and maintained.</P>
<P>The Anonymous Authour hath these words; this Realm hath only three prin∣cipal Rivers, whereon a Royal City may well be scituated; <HI>Trent</HI> in the North, <HI>Severne</HI> in the South-west, and <HI>Thames</HI> in the South-east: of the which <HI>Thames</HI> both for the streight course in length reacheth furthest into the belly of the Land, and for the breadth, and stillness
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>
of the water is most navigable up, and down the stream: by reason whereof <HI>London</HI> standing almost in the middle of that course, is more commodiously served with provision of necessaries, than any Town standing upon the other two Rivers can be, and doth also more easily communicate to the rest of the Realm the commodities of her own enter∣course, and Traffique. Thus much for the honour of the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>

<P><HI>LOndon</HI> Bridge was first made of Timber, and maintained partly by the proper Lands thereof, partly by the liberality of divers persons, and partly by Taxations in divers Shires, for the space of 215. years before the Bridge of stone was builded; which Bridge of stone was 33. years in buil∣ding: A work very rare, having with the Draw-Bridge, 20.

<P>LEt us now come to the Gates of this City. <HI>Cambden</HI> in his <HI>Britannia</HI> speakes thus of them: On the West∣side, sayes he, there be two: to wit▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lud gate</NOTE> Lud-gate of King <HI>Lud,</HI> or Flud-gate, as <HI>Lelandus</HI> is of opinion, of a little flood, running beneath it, built again of Late from the very foundation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-gate</NOTE> and New-gate, the fairest of them all, so called of the newness thereof, whereas before it was termed Chamber-Laugate, which also is the publique Goal or Prison.

<P>Bishopsgate of a Bishop, which gate the Duch Merchants of the stilyard were bound by Covenant both to repair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishops-gate.</NOTE> and also to defend at all times of Danger, and extremity.</P>
<P>On the East side there is Ald-gate alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ald-gate.</NOTE> so named of the oldness or Elbe-gate, as others terme it, which at this present is by the Cities charge re-edi∣fyed.</P>
<P>It is thought (sayes he) that there stood by the <HI>Thamis,</HI> beside that on the Bridge, two Gates more, namely, Belins-gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belins-gate.</NOTE> a wharfe now, or a Key for the receipt of Ships, and Doure-gate, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dow-gate</NOTE> the Water-gate, commonly called Dow-gate.</P>
<P>These Gates in Latine are called <HI>por∣tae à portando,</HI> from carrying, and lifting the plough; and it was upon this occa∣sion: In the building of Cities, the founders thereof did usually con∣sult with their Gods in their Au∣gural Observations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godw.

built, by plowing up the ground; and because they left that space of ground unplowed, lightly lifting the plow over it, where they appointed the gate of the City, thence <HI>à portando,</HI> from car∣rying, and lifting the plough, they called the Gate <HI>Porta.</HI></P>
<P>Both the Gates, and Walls of Cities were looked upon as sacred things among the <HI>Romans</HI>; for the Civil Law Text speakes thus;</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. Of the Cathedral of <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are worthy of our notice, in relation to the famous Cathedral Church of <HI>London,</HI> these five things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Founder of this Church; <HI>Aethelbert,</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> under whom <HI>Sebert</HI> reigned in this tract of Ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stow</NOTE> as it were his vassal and by courtesie, founded here a Church, and Consecra∣ted it to S. <HI>Paul,</HI> and about the year of Christ, 610. he gave thereto Lands; and so did afterward <HI>Athelstan, Edgar, Edward</HI>: the Confessor, and others also.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Magnificence of its Building;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno</HI> 1086.</NOTE> <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> informeth us; That the beauty of St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church is so magnificent that it deserves, to be numbered in the Rank of excellent Edi∣fices: so large is that arched Vault underneath, and the Church above it of such Capacity, that it may seem suffi∣cient to receive any multitude of people whatsoever.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Dimensions of this Fabrick, in point of Longitude, Latitude, and Altitude.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="17"/>St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church (sayes <HI>Cambden</HI> out of an old writer) containeth in length 690. foot: the breadth thereof is 130. foot: the height of the west ar∣ched Roof from the ground carryeth 102. foot: and the new Fabrique from the ground, is 88. foot high. The stone work of the steeple from the plain ground riseth in height, 260. foot, and the Timber frame upon the same, is 274. foot high, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Stow</HI> thus, the height of the Steeple was 520. foot, whereof the stone work is 260. foot, and the Spire was likewise 260. foot, the length of the whole Church is .240. Taylers yards, which makes 720. foot: the breadth thereof is 130. foot, and the height of the body of the Church, is 150. foot.</P>

It hath likewise 30. Prebendaries, Ca∣nons 12. Vicars Corals six, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Note,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stow.</NOTE> that the Colledge of Petty Canons there, was founded by King R. II. in honor of Queen <HI>Anne</HI> his wife, and of her Progenitors, in 17. of his reign. In the year 1408. the Petty Canons then building their Colledge, the Mayor, and Commonalty of this Ce∣lebrious City, granted them their water courses, and other easements.</P>
<P N="5">5. The sad Accidents, that have befaln this famous Church at several times.</P>
<P>In the year 1087. this Church of St <HI>Paul</HI> was burnt with fire, and therewith the most part of the City: which fire began at the entry of the West-gate, and consumed the East-gate. <HI>Mauritius,</HI> then Bishop, began therefore the foun∣dation of a new Church of St <HI>Pauls.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1444. the Steeple of <HI>Pauls</HI> was fired by Lightning, in the midst of the shaft or spire, and in the year 1462. this Steeple was repaired, and the weather Cock again erected.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="18"/>In the year 1561. the fourth of <HI>June,</HI> betwixt the Hour of three, and four of the Clock in the afternoon, the great Spire of the Steeple of S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, was fired by Lightning, which brake forth (as it seemed) two, or three yards, beneath the foot of the Crosse, and from thence it brent downeward the Spire to the Battlements, stone worke, and Bells so furiously, that within the space of four hours, the same Steeple with all the Roof of the Church were consumed. After this mischance, the Queens Majesty directed her Letters to the Lord Mayor, willing him to take order for speedy repairing the same. And she of her princely, and gratious dispo∣sition, for the furtherance thereof, did presently give and deliver in gold 1000. marks, with a warrant for a thousand Loads of Timber, to be taken out of her woods or elsewhere.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stow.</NOTE>The Citizens also gave first a great benevolence, and after that 3. fifteens to be speedily paid. The Clergy of <HI>En∣gland</HI> likewise, within the Province of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> granted the fourtieth part the value of their benefices, charged with first fruits, the thirtieth part of
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>
such as were not so charged, but the Clergy of <HI>London</HI> Diocess, granted the thirtieth part of such as paid their fruits.</P>
<P>Six Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> and two Petty Canons of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, had charge to further and over see the work.</P>
<P>In the year 1650. &amp;c. It was made a stable for Horses, and a Denn for Thieves, and Rebells.</P>
<P>In the year 1666. it was burnt again to the ground together with all the Ci∣ty; and there is now (this being the year 1675.) began the Foundation of a new Church of St <HI>Paul,</HI> so that the founda∣tion of this <HI>London</HI> Cathedral, has been thrice laid; God Speed the work.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. Of the distribution of this renowed City into parts, and likewise of its extent.</HEAD>
<P>AS for the Division of this City for the better Regiment thereof, I shall vouch three several Authors, viz. Sir <HI>Edward Coke, Fitz-Sephen,</HI> and <HI>Stow.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Sir <HI>Ed. Coke</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Co.</HI> 4. <HI>Iust.</HI> 249.</NOTE> that in this City there are twenty and six wards, divided for the government of the Trenobants, or Citizens of <HI>London,</HI>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Fitz-Steven</HI> saith, that this City, even as <HI>Rome,</HI> is divided into wards; It hath yearly Sheriffs, instead of Con∣suls, it hath the Dignity of Senators, and Aldermen, it hath under Officers, and according to the Quality of Laws, it hath several Courts, and general, Assemblies upon appointed daies.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Stow</HI> informeth us, that this City of <HI>London</HI> is divided into Wards, or Aldermanries, and the number of them in <HI>London,</HI> were both before, and in the Reign of H. 3. twenty four in all, and in the year of Christ 1393. the 17.

<P>Moreover in the year 1550. the Lord Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> purchasing the Liberties of the Borough of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> appointed the same to be a Ward of <HI>London,</HI> which

<P>Note, the City of <HI>London</HI> is a County, and every Ward is an hundred in the County, and the Parishes are as Vills or Towns. But note likewise;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co.

<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> The Aldermen.</HEAD>
<P>IN relation to Aldermen three things are worthy of notice, <HI>sc.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Etymology of the words (Alderman, and Senator.)</P>
<P>An Alderman is among the Romans, <HI>Laticlavius, Senator,</HI> and <HI>Optimas.</HI></P>
<P>An Alderman from the <HI>Saxon</HI> word Ealderman, <HI>i. e. Senex, quod Senes solum∣modo illum dignitatis gradum accipiant</HI>: Hence among the Latins, he is called Senator.</P>
<P><HI>Gothofredus</HI> tells us, that <HI>Senatores dicti non sunt ab assentiendo,</HI> as <HI>Hugoli∣nus,</HI> and <HI>Bartolus</HI> suppose, but <HI>à senili aetate,</HI> or <HI>à virtute,</HI> for heretofore, <HI>Senes apud Romanos Viri optimi appellati sunt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="23"/><HI>Olim apud Britones</HI> (sayes one) <HI>tem∣poribus Romanorum in regno isto Britanniae vocabantur Senatores qui postea temporibus Saxonum vocabantur Aldermanas, non propter aetatem, sed propter sapientiam, &amp; dignitatem, cùm quidam adolescentes essent, Jurisperiti tamen &amp; super hoc experti.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Their election; The Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> were changed by election every year, until 28. E. 3. Then it was or∣dered, that they should not be removed, without some special cause.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Co.</HI> 4. <HI>Inst.</HI> 253.</NOTE> But <HI>Rot.

And so it still continueth.</P>
<P>Yearly on the Feast of St <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-Angel on of these Aldermen is elected to be Mayor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stow.</NOTE> for the year following, to be begun on the 28. of October, the other Aldermen his brethren, are to him assistents in Counsels, Courts, &amp;c.

<P N="3">3. The priviledge of these Alder∣men in respect of offices in the Coun∣trey, which will appear by this fol∣lowing case.</P>
<P><HI>John Abdy,</HI> Alderman of <HI>London,</HI> having a House at . . . . in the County of <HI>Essex,</HI> where it was pretended, that Constables should be elected out of the Inhabitants in every house by present∣ment every year in Leet of Sir <HI>William Hickes,</HI> Lord of the said Manor, and Leet; the said Alderman <HI>Abdy,</HI> by the name of <HI>John Abdy</HI> Esquire was nomi∣nated in a Leet such a day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro. <HI>3.</HI> part.

Alderman of <HI>London,</HI> ought to be there resident, the greatest part of the year, and if absent, is fineable; and all the Court of the Kings Bench held, that he ought to be discharged by his priviledg, and although it was said, he might execute it by Deputy, and his personal Attendance is not requisite, by the custome of the sad Mannor; yet <HI>non allocatur</HI>; whereupon the said priviledg was awarded.</P>

<P>A Recorder, is he, whom the Mayor, or other Magistrate of any City, or Town Corporate, having jurisdiction, or a Court of Record within their precincts by the Kings grant, doth associate unto him for this better direction in matters of Justice, and proceedings according to Law.</P>
<P>Thus much in general of the Recor∣der-ship of any City, or Town, but more particularly, we say, <HI>That the Recorder of London,</HI> is the person, whom the <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> and <HI>Aldermen</HI> do asso∣ciate unto them for their better dire∣ction in matters of Justice, and pro∣ceedings
<PB N="42" REF="25"/>
according to Law; and there∣fore he ought to be a grave, and Learned Lawyer, well seen in the Common Law, and skillful in the Customs of the City; and such a one indeed is that ho∣nourable and very grave person, <HI>Sir John Howell</HI> (a member of the Royal Society of <HI>Lincolns</HI> Inne,) who at this very time is Recorder of this most glorious City.</P>
<P>The Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> takes place in Councils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stow.</NOTE> and in Courts, before any man, that hath not been Lord Mayor, and learnedly delivers the Sentences of the whole Court.</P>

<HEAD><HI>4.</HI> The Sheriffs.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I speak in particular of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> I shall present to the Reader several Queries, (with resolutions given unto them out of our books of Law) touching Sheriffs in general. For the better Information of all such Officers through the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 1. Whence the word Sheriffs is derived?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> Sheriff is a word compounded of two <HI>Saxon</HI> words, viz. <HI>Shire,</HI> and <HI>Reve, Shire, Satrapia,</HI> or <HI>Comitatus,</HI> cometh out of the <HI>Saxon</HI> verb <HI>Shiram,</HI> i. e. <HI>partivi,</HI> for that the whole Realm is parted, and divided into Shires.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. Litt. <HI>168.</HI> a.</NOTE> And <HI>Reve</HI> is <HI>praefectus,</HI> or <HI>praepositus</HI>; so as Shireve is the Rive of the Shire, <HI>Prae∣fectus Satrapiae, Provinciae,</HI> or <HI>Comita∣tus</HI>; And he is called <HI>Praefectus,</HI> because he is the chief officer to the King within the <HI>Shire</HI>; for the words of his patent be <HI>Commissimus vobis custodiam Comita∣tus nostri, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quere</HI> 2. How a Sheriff was,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quere</HI> 2.</NOTE> and is to be elected?</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="26"/><HI>Resp.</HI> It is to be known, that the office of a Coroner ever was, and yet is eligible in full County by the Free∣holders, by the Kings writ, <HI>de Coro∣natore eligendo</HI>: and the reason thereof was, for that both the King, and the County had a great interest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. <HI>2.</HI> Inst. fol. <HI>174.</HI> &amp; <HI>175.</HI> &amp; <HI>558.</HI> &amp; <HI>559.</HI></NOTE> and be∣nefit in the due execution of his office; and therefore the Common Law gave the Freeholders of the County, to be electers of him. And for the same reason of ancient time the Sheriff called <HI>Vice-Comes,</HI> who had <HI>Custodiam Comitatus,</HI> was also eligible: for, first the Earl himself of the County had the office of the Sheriff of the County, and when he gave it over, the <HI>Vice-Comes</HI> (as the word signifieth) came instead of the Earl, and was eligible by the Free∣holders of the County; but this way by election is altered by divers Acts of Par∣liament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14. <HI>E.</HI> 3 <HI>c.</HI> 7.23. <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 8.12. <HI>R.</HI> 2 <HI>c.</HI> 3.</NOTE> viz the Act. of 9. <HI>E.</HI> 2. Lincolne <HI>de Vice-Comitibus</HI> 14. E. 3.12. R. 2. &amp; 23. H. 6. <HI>vide</HI> the Statuts themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 3. Whether the Day of the Billing of Sheriffs, may be deferred from the usual day?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> Upon the sixth of <HI>November</HI> the Term of <HI>Michael</HI> 16. <HI>Car. Regis,</HI> the
<PB N="45" REF="26"/>
Lord Keeper of the great Seal, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord privy Seal, Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> Earl Marshall, the Earl of Pembrok, Lord Chamberlin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro. <HI>3.</HI> part. Terme Mich. <HI>16.</HI> Car. Regis in Banco Regis</NOTE> the Lord <HI>Cotington</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer, were assembled in the Exchequer Cham∣ber, to nominate three persons, of every County throughout <HI>England,</HI> to be presented unto the King, that he might prick one of them, to be Sheriff of every County, which is usually done according to the Statute upon the 3. of <HI>Nov,</HI> being <HI>Crastino animarum</HI>; But because it was the first day of Parliament, and the Lords were to attend the King, It was resolved by the advise, and resolution of the Major part of the Justices, with whom Con∣ference was had in this cause, that it might be well put off to another day. And the Lord Keeper notwithstanding the Statute deferred it until this day.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 4. In what the office of the Sheriff doth consist?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> It belongeth to the Sheriff, to serve the Kings writs of pro∣cess, be they summons, or Attachments, to compell men to answer, to the Law, and all writs of execution of the Law, according to judgments of superior
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>
Courts, for taking mens goods, Lands or bodies, as the cause requireth; and by the Order of the Common Law, and Statutes of the Realm, he may for the better execution of his Majesties writs, and process of Law, after resistance, take <HI>posse Comitutus.</HI></P>
<P>He is to return indifferent Juries, for the Tryal of mens Lives, Liberties, Lands, and Goods.</P>
<P>He ought to see, that the publique Peace be kept, which is the Life of the Commonwealth; and therefore he is said to be <HI>Principalis Conservator Pacis,</HI> within the County.</P>
<P>It is his duty, to gather the publique monies, and profits of the Prince in his County, to collect, and bring into the Exchequer, all fines imposed, even by distreining.</P>
<P>He is to see condemned persons exe∣cuted. To conclude, he is to determine, and examine certain smaller pleas Civil and Criminal; the former are decided in the County Court; the latter in his Court, called the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 5. If one be in the Sheriffs Custody, by process of Law, and then another writ is delivered to apprehend
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
the body of the party, that is already in Custody, whether he be in Custody by vertue of the second writ, without an Actual Arrest?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> It was adjudged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. Lib. <HI>5.</HI> Frosts case f. <HI>89.</HI></NOTE> that when a man is in Custody of the Sheriff, by process of the Law, and afterward another writ is delivered unto him, to ap∣prehend the body of him, who is already in Custody; Immediatly he is in Custody, by force of the second writ, by judgment of Law, although he make no actual Arrest of him, for to what purpose should the Sheriff arrest the party, that is already in Custody; and <HI>Lex non praecipit inutilia; quia inutilis Labor est stultus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 6. Whether a Sheriff, Bailiff, &amp;c. may arrest one without shewing the warrant?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> It was adjudged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. Lib. <HI>9.</HI> Mackaleyes Case Lib. <HI>6.</HI> Count of Rut∣lands Case. Cro. <HI>2.</HI> part. Hodges vers. Markes.</NOTE> that an Arrest without shewing the warrant, and without telling at whose suit, until the party demand, is Legal, and well enough, and that he need not shew the warrant, until the other obey, and demand it.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 7. Whether an Arrest made in the night be good.</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> It is said, that an Arrest made in
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
the night time is valid in Law. <HI>Cro.</HI> 2. part. <HI>Mackaleyes</HI> Case <HI>Co.</HI> lib. 9. <HI>Macka∣leyes</HI> Case.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 8. Whether Arrests be good on the Sunday.</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> An Arrest upon the Sunday, and other ministerial Acts are good, but not judicial Acts; for a judicial writ bearing <HI>Teste</HI> upon a Sunday, or a Proclamation of affine upon a Sunday are ill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro. <HI>2.</HI> part. Waite vers. Hundred of Stoke <HI>496.</HI></NOTE> and erro∣nious; for they shall be intended, as fictions, because it is well known the Court do not sit that day, but an ori∣ginal writ, or patent, bearing <HI>Teste</HI> upon the Sunday, are good enough, for the Chancellor may seal writs, or patents upon any day.</P>
<P>An Arrest made by a Sheriff, or his Officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro. <HI>2.</HI> part. Mackaleyes case.</NOTE> is valid, although it be done upon a Sunday.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 9. In what Cases a Sheriff may break open houses to execute pro∣cess?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> As to this <HI>Quaere</HI> take these particularities, <HI>sc.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. When any house is recovered by any Real Action, or by <HI>Ejectione firmae,</HI> the Sheriff may break the house, and deliver seizin or possession.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="49" REF="28"/>2. In all cases, where the King is party, the Sheriff may break the house (if the doors be shut) and make execution of his writ, but before he break the house, he ought to signify the cause of his coming, and make request to have the Doors opened: but if the Officer break the house, when he might have the Doors opened, he is a Trespasser; for felony, or suspition of felony the officer may break open the door.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Sheriff cannot break open an house upon private process; neither can he upon private process rush into a house, which by craft, as knocking at the door &amp;c. he procured to be opened unto him.</P>
<P N="4">4. In all Cases where the door is open, the Sheriff may enter, and make execution of his writ, either for body, or goods, at the suit of a subject.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Sheriff at the suit of Com∣mon person (upon request made, and denial thereof) ought not to break open the doors, or the house, to exe∣cute any process at the suit of any subject; or to execute a <HI>Fierifac.</HI> Being a writ of execution, but he is a Tres∣passer, yet if he do execution in the
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
house it is good in Law, being done; according to the rule of Law; <HI>sunt multa, quae impediunt promovendum, quae non dejiciunt jam prometum.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The house of a man is not a Castle, or defence for any other person, but for the owner, his family and goods, and not to protect another, that flyeth into the same, or the goods of another, for then the Sheriff upon Request, and denial, may break the house, and do execution.</P>
<P N="7">7. Although, a Sheriff cannot break open an house, being to take execution by <HI>fieri facias,</HI> yet when the Door is open, that he enters, and be disturbed in his execution by the parties, who are within the house, he may break the house, to rescue his Bayliffs, and to take execution. <HI>Vide</HI> all these particulars <HI>Cro.</HI> 1. part. <HI>Seyman</HI> vers. <HI>Gresham.

<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 10. Whether a writ, or Com∣mission
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>
may be awarded to a Sheriff, to enquire of the Death of a man?</P>
<P><HI>Res.</HI> It was found before the Coroner, <HI>super visam corporis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. part, Harlestons Case</NOTE> that <HI>J. Harleston</HI> fell into a Marlepit <HI>fortuito,</HI> and so died. Afterwards by the procurement of the Queens Almoner a Commission issued out of the Crown Office (<HI>Quaesi</HI> in nature of a <HI>Melius Inquirendum</HI>) and was awarded to the Sheriff to enquire of his death, and of what goods, and Chattells, he was possessed at the time of his death. And it was found before the Sheriff, that he was <HI>felo de se,</HI> &amp;c. It was moved, that the writ, or Commission was not well awarded, but utterly void; for the Stat. of 28. <HI>E.</HI> 3. c. 9. is expressely, that no such Commission shall be granted, and that the Sheriff shall not take Indictment by writ, or Commission. But <HI>Ive,</HI> the Clerk said, that they have divers Presidents, since that Statute, of such Commissions awarded.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 11. Whether Rescous be a good Return upon mean process?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> It has been adjudged, that in an Arrest upon mean process, and not upon execution, the Sheriffs are not bound to take the <HI>poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Comitatas</HI> with

them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro <HI>2.</HI> part. May v. Proby, and Lum Sheriffs of Middlesex.</NOTE> and therefore upon such process, it is a good return, the Rescous, and that afterwards he was not found within their Bayliwick; and process shall, thereupon be awarded against the Re∣scussours: But if the Prisoner had been in the Goal, the Sheriff ought at his peril to keep him, and a Rescous from thence is no excuse for him: And upon process of execution, as upon a <HI>Capias ad satisfac.</HI> or upon a <HI>Capias ut legatum,</HI> after judgement, such a Return is no excuse for him, either against the King, or the party; for he at his peril ought to keep his prisoners taken in execution; for there the process is determined▪ which being the Life of the Law, and being once executed, the party may not have any new process, and therefore he shall answer to the party for the escape. And it is at the Sheriffs peril, to see that his prison be strong enough, to keep his prisoner, when he is once in execution. And being a mischeif to one it ought rather to fall on the Sheriff than on the party: But in the other cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is not any great mischief, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> party hath only lost his process, which he may renew; and he may also have
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>
an Action upon the Case against the Rescussours.</P>
<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 12. Whether an Averrement may be admitted against a Sheriffs Re∣turn?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> There is a difference between Acts ministerial, and Acts judicial, for against Acts, which a Sheriff doth as ministerial, an Averrement may be, but not against that, which is done ju∣dicially, and by one as judge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. part.

<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 13. Whether a prisoner for debt, making an escape, can be taken again upon fresh suit?</P>
<P><HI>Resp.</HI> Although a prisoner in execu∣tion escape out of view, yet if fresh suite be made, and he be taken again <HI>in recenti in secutione,</HI> he shall be in execu∣tion, otherwise at the turning of a corner, or by entring into an House, or other Means, the prisoner may be out of view, and although he fly into another County,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. lib. <HI>31</HI> Ridgewayes.

<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 15. Whether there may be an escape, altho the party alwayes con∣tinues in prison?</P>

<P>This word Constable is diversly us∣ed in our Common Law: And first, The Constable of <HI>England,</HI> who is al∣so called Marshal; of whose Autho∣rity and Dignity a man may find ma∣ny arguments and signs, as well in the Statutes, as in the Chronicles of this Realm, his sway consisteth in the care of the common Peace of the Land, in deeds of Arms, and matters of war.</P>
<P>Out of this Magistracy were drawn these lower Constables, which we call Constables of Hundreds, and Liberties, and first ordained by the Statute of <HI>Winton</HI> 13. <HI>Ed.</HI> 1. which appoints for the conservation of the Peace, and view of Armour, two Constables in every Hundred, and Liberty, and these be at this time cal∣led High Constables, because the in∣crease of People and Offences, hath again undet those made others in e∣very Town, called Petty Constables, who are of the like nature, but of in∣ferior Authority to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="40"/>Besides these, there are Officers of particular places called by this name, as Constable of the <HI>Tower,</HI> Constable of the <HI>Exchecquer,</HI> Constable of <HI>Do∣ver</HI> Castle, Constable of <HI>Windsor</HI>; and the now Constable of the famous Ca∣stle of <HI>Windsor</HI> is his Highness Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Duke of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> a Per∣son most renowned, not onely for his brave conduct and fortitude in marti∣al affairs both by Sea and Land; but also for his great zeal and Love, shewn abundantly in defence of the Prote∣stant Religion.</P>
