<HEAD>An Exact JOURNAL OF THE Siege of Lymerick, From the <HI>8th</HI> to the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> 1691.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From an Officer in the Camp, to his Friend in <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the Ninth, about Two in the Afternoon the Enemy came out, and appeared as if they intended a Sally, but design∣ed only to secure a Ditch that lay betwixt them and our Batteries, which was no sooner known, but our Men marcht down upon them, and beat them back into the Town, killing about 30, with the loss only of one Granadeer: All this day our Guns and Mortars plaid furiously on the Town, and so continued all Night without intermission; On the <HI>12th,</HI> in the Morning early came over to us one Captain <HI>Dobbins,</HI> who says, That yesterday in beating the Enemy into the Town we killed two of their Majors, and one of our Bombs killed Monsieur <HI>La Four,</HI> who was Brother to the Governour, and that the Governour and Officers, to keep up the Hearts of the Town and Garison, assure them, that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet have totally beat the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and forced those <HI>En∣glish</HI> Vessels with Captain <HI>Cole</HI> into the <HI>Shannon,</HI> but that day, or within 48 hours a Squadron of <HI>French</HI> would come into the River to their Relief, and wholly destroy the <HI>English,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That the Garison Consisted of about 15000, of which but 7 or 8000 were well armed, and had no Horse, nor did any Horse come there in the Night to Guard. All this day we con∣tinued Firing, and about Six and Night the Town appear∣ed on Fire, in many places; to prevent its spreading, the Enemy blew up Divers Houses and Buildings, notwithstanding which, some very Considerable Place continued burning with great violence un∣til Two the next Morning.</P>
<P>The <HI>11th</HI> in the Morning came to the General, some Officers of <HI>Cunningham</HI>'s Regiment Col. <HI>Echlin,</HI> of the loss of their Coll. and to pray the General's Favour to have the Regiment: The said Coll, Sir <HI>Albert Cunningham</HI>'s Regiment being detached from the Camp to join the Forces for the reducing of <HI>Sligo,</HI> and he staying after them, did follow with Ten Men only as a Guard. In their March, upon the Hills near <HI>Boyle,</HI> they unhappily mistook their way in a Fogg, and fell into the Hands of 2 or 300 <HI>Rapparees,</HI> to whom they sold their Lives at the utmost Rate, killing about 25, but were at last over∣pour'd,
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>and cut in pieces, whose Blood was soon reveng'd by <HI>Bal∣derick O Donnel,</HI> who was in hearing of the Guns, but came too late to save the Brave Coll. however he kill'd many of them, and Routed the rest: We continued to batter and Bomb the Town all this day and all night.</P>
<P>The <HI>12th,</HI> Last night and this day we continued firing into the Town without Intermission. This Morning came to us Ten Dragoons and an Officer, Deserters, who say, That in the great Fire that was in the Town on the Tenth at night, the Bombs set Fire to Three Magazines; one of Powder, which in blowing up, set Fire unto, and burnt great part of the <HI>English Town,</HI> and much o∣ther Mischiefs, the other two of Beef, Bisket, Oates, Brandy and Wine, which was all destroy'd, and would be soon wanted a∣mongst them.</P>
<P>The Weather hitherto continues very good; the Breach in the Wall is very wide, and is every moment wider: Our Guns con∣tinually firing thereat, which gives us hopes of being Masters there∣of in a very few days, above half the Town being already ruin'd with our Ball, Bombs, Carcasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our Men are Impatient to Storm, but when it will be we know not, all things being kept secret until put in Action.</P>
<P>The <HI>13th.</HI> the General sent an Express to the Queen, and we con∣tinued all day to Batter the Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>14th</HI> the General sent two Regiments towards <HI>Clonmell</HI> and <HI>Waterford</HI> to reinforce the Militia, there being many Prisoners at the latter, and the <HI>Irish</HI> in those parts become Insolent. His Excellency hath also sent Miners and Guards to support them, with Orders to blow up and demolish Castle <HI>Connell</HI> and the other Castles we have taken near <HI>Lymerick</HI> on the <HI>Shannon,</HI> and elsewhere, to prevent their being any more Nests of Rebels, Raparees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>15th</HI> we continued to Bomb and Batter the Town, and made the Breaches so wide that we plainly see into the Town, which looks ruinous. The Enemy have made much Sod-works, and a very deep Trench or Ditch with Pallisadoes and Stockadoes, yet the Men con∣tinue impatient to storm, they hoping to have had Orders to have made this night a general Assault, but as yet hear nothing thereof, though some think the Camp are ready for the work in all points.</P>
<P><HI>Dublin</HI> the <HI>17th.</HI> This night was Published a Proclamation of the Lords Justices for a full and free Pardon to all Raparees and others in Arms against the Government, provided they come in and lay down their Arms in 20 days, otherwise to be excluded from Mercy, and not only leave given for any Person to kill them, but a reward of 40 <HI>s.</HI> for each Head brought in, Which shall immediately be paid by the next Justice of Peace, and the publick Revenue to reimburse it, which it's thought will be an effectual way to clear the whole King∣dom, and prove more advantageous than droves of Cattel to the Raparee Hunters.</P>
