<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAving already published a brief Treatise called, <HI>Historical Remarks of London and Westminster,</HI> which hath found general acceptation, I was encouraged to prosecute the same design, upon every County in <HI>England,</HI> as also in <HI>Wales, Scotland and Ireland,</HI> wherein the Reader cannot be so unreasonable to expect an exact description of every Town or considera∣ble place, that having been already performed at large by divers others; this being only a Collecti∣on of the Natural, and Artificial Curiosities, Rarities and Wonders, &amp; likewise of several Re∣markable Places, and Persons, with the Prodigi∣ous Accidents in each County, as I find them in <HI>Mr.</HI> Fox, <HI>Dr.</HI> Heylin, <HI>Dr.</HI> Fuller, <HI>Sir</HI> Rich. Baker, <HI>Mr.</HI> Speed, <HI>Mr.</HI> Clark, and several o∣ther Authors of credit, which I have not parti∣cularly named to every Relation, because it would have taken up too much room most of the particu∣lars
<PB REF="3"/>
herein being very well known to the Learned, and for others it will not signify much, since this is published for the sake of those that are desirous of knowledge, but are not in a capacity to buy a multitude of Books; now though the Title speaks of Battels and Seiges, yet I have purposely omit∣ted all of that kind which have happened in our late Civil Wars, as having already published a book of the same price with this, wherein is a succinct Account of all the Transactions during the Reign of K. <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>1.</HI> till His Majesties Happy Restoration; I desire it may please all, since I intend to offend none, but only to serve the Publick and my self, wherein if I find suc∣cess, I shall be very well satisfied, neither can the Reader be much displeased to have so much variety for so little money, and to find that not∣withstanding some think there are no wonders but in other Countries, he may yet observe there are it may be as strange things at home as in o∣ther places.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>BRITTAIN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Island of <HI>Brittain</HI> is of all others the most famous, and has been accounted the greatest in the World; it compre∣hendeth all those Islands both great and less, which lie in compass about it, the length thereof from South to North (that is from <HI>Lysard</HI> Point in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> to the North of <HI>Scotland</HI>) is 624 miles, and the breadth thereof from the Lands end in <HI>Cornwall</HI> to the Isle of <HI>Thanet</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> about 300 <HI>English</HI> miles; It is a Country always very temperate, and was highly esteemed by the <HI>Romans,</HI> as appears by what hath been said concerning it, by one of their Orators, who calls it, the happy and most fortunate Island, endued by nature with all the blessings of Heaven and Earth, in that therein is neither extream cold in Winter, nor scorching heats in Summer, and that which is most com∣fortable, <HI>long daies, and very lightsome nights;</HI> wherein there is such an abundance of Grain, as may suffice both for Bread and Wine; the Woods thereof are without wild Beasts, the Fields without noysom Serpents, but therein are vast numbers of Milch Beasts, and Sheep weighed down with their own Fleeces. To which may be added what <HI>Alfred</HI> the Poet of <HI>Beverly</HI> writ long since of <HI>Brittain.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Insula praedive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, quae toto vix eget orbe,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A wealthy Island which no help desires,</L>
<L>Yet all the world supply from her requires,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>Able to glut King <HI>Solomon</HI> with pleasures;</L>
<L>And surfeit Great <HI>Augustus</HI> with her Treasures.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>As to the name <HI>Brittain</HI> there is no great certainty of its Original; that which hath passed for currant in for∣mer times (when almost all Nations did pretend to be of <HI>Trojan</HI> Race) was, that it took this name from <HI>Brutus,</HI> affirmed to be the Son of <HI>Silvius,</HI> Grand-Child of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and third King of the <HI>Latines</HI> of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Blood, which <HI>Brutus</HI> having unfortunately killed his Father, and there∣upon flying from <HI>Italy</HI> with his Friends and followers, after a long Voyage, and many wandrings, is said to have fallen upon this Island, and to have conquered here a race of Giants, and having given unto it the name of <HI>Brittain,</HI> to leave the Soveraignty thereof to his posteri∣ty, who quietly enjoyed the same, till subdued by the <HI>Romans;</HI> but this Tradition has been since laid aside, as altogether fabulous, since the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians never mention either <HI>Brutus</HI> or the Giants, <HI>Caesar</HI> telling us, that he found the <HI>Brittains</HI> under many Kings, and ne∣ver under the command of one sole Prince, but in times of Danger; it is therefore more probable that it was de∣rived from <HI>Britt,</HI> which in the <HI>Brittish</HI> Language signi∣fies <HI>Painted,</HI> and the word <HI>Tain</HI> a Nation, agreeable to the custom of the Ancient <HI>Brittains,</HI> who used to discolour and paint their Bodies, that they might seem more ter∣rible in the Eyes of their Enemies, such as the <HI>Romans</HI> called afterwards <HI>Picts,</HI> or Painted Men; other particu∣lars may be observed in the description of those parts into which it is now divided, that is, 1. <HI>England.</HI> 2. <HI>Wales.</HI> 3. <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ENGLAND</HI> is bounded on the East with the <HI>German;</HI> on the West with the <HI>Irish;</HI> on the South with the <HI>Brittish</HI> Oceans; and on the North with the Rivers of <HI>Tweed</HI> and <HI>Solway,</HI> and thereby parted from <HI>Scotland,</HI> invironed with Turbulent Seas, guarded by inaccessible Rocks, and where these are wanting, preserved against all Forreign Invasions by strong Forts, and a puissant
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Navy. The whole Island was first called <HI>Albion,</HI> either from the story of one of the Giants so called, or <HI>Ab al∣bis Rupibus, the white Rocks</HI> toward <HI>France,</HI> which name continued till the time of <HI>Egbert</HI> the first <HI>Saxon</HI> Mon∣arch, who called the Southern parts thereof <HI>England,</HI> from the <HI>Angles,</HI> who with the <HI>Juits</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> conque∣red it; <HI>Pelagius</HI> being Bishop of <HI>Rome, Gregory</HI> seeing some beautiful Children in the Market place of <HI>Rome</HI> to be sold, he inquireth what Country they were of, who answered <HI>Angli (Englishmen)</HI> and were Heathens; <HI>what pity is it</HI> (said he) <HI>that the Inhabitants being so fair and Angelical of Countenance, should yet be subject to the Prince of Darkness;</HI> asking further of what Province they were, they answered <HI>Deira</HI> (a Province in <HI>England</HI> then so called) <HI>These People</HI> (saith he) <HI>are to be delivered</HI> de Ira Dei, <HI>from the Wrath of God;</HI> and understanding the name of one of the Youths was <HI>Alle, They ought</HI> (saies he) <HI>to sing Allelujah to the living God;</HI> upon this <HI>Gregory</HI> was mighty desirous to come hither to convert these Heathens, but could not at that time, yet after <HI>Pelagius</HI> his death being chosen Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and remem∣bring his former intentions he sent <HI>Austin</HI> with about 40 more Preachers to undertake this work. This Nation enjoys a soil equally participating of ground fit for Til∣lage or Pasture; most of her other Plenties and Orna∣ments are expressed in this old verse following.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Anglia Mens, Pons, Fons, Ecclesia, Foemina, Lana,</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Mountains, Bridges, Rivers, Churches fair,</L>
<L>Women, and Wool, <HI>England</HI> is past compare.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>For the Mountains here and there lift up their lofty heads, and give a gallant prospect to the lower grounds; all of them having Mines in their Bowels, or else are clothed with Sheep, or adorned with Woods; the Bridges are in number 857, the chief whereof are <HI>Rochester</HI> Bridge over <HI>Medway; Bristol</HI> Bridge over <HI>Avon;</HI> and <HI>London</HI> Bridge over the <HI>Thames;</HI> the Rivers are 325, the Principal being the <HI>Thames,</HI> of which a <HI>German</HI> Poet thus truly spake,
<Q><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<LG>
<L><HI>Tot Càmpos, Sylvas, tot Regia tecta, tot Hortos,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We saw so many Woods and Princely Bowers,</L>
<L>Sweet Fields, brave Pallaces, and stately Towers;</L>
<L>So many Gardens drest with curious care,</L>
<L>That <HI>Thames</HI> with Royal <HI>Tyber</HI> may compare.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The Churches before the General Suppression of Ab∣bles, were most exquisite. The Women are generally handsomer than in other places, sufficiently endowed with natural Beauties, without the Adulteration of Art. In an absolute Woman (say the <HI>Italians</HI>) are required the parts of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Woman from the Girdle downward, of a <HI>French</HI> Woman from the Girdle to the Shoulders, over which must be placed an <HI>English</HI> Face; as their Beauties so likewise their Prerogatives are the greatest of any Nation, neither so servilly submissive as the <HI>French,</HI> nor so jealously guarded as the <HI>Italian,</HI> but keep∣ing so true a <HI>decorum,</HI> that as <HI>England</HI> is termed <HI>the Pur∣gatory of Servants, and the Hell of Horses,</HI> so it is ac∣knowledged <HI>the Paradise of Women:</HI> And it is a common by-word among the <HI>Italians, That if there were a Bridge built over the narrow Seas, all the Women of</HI> Europe <HI>would run into</HI> England: For here they have the upper hand in the Streets, the upper place at the Table, the Thirds of their Husbands Estates, and their equal share in all Lands; which are Priviledges wherewith other Wo∣men are not acquainted; they were of high esteem in former times amongst Forreign Nations, for the mo∣desty and gravity of their Conversations, but the Women of these times are so much addicted to the light Garb of the <HI>French,</HI> that they have lost much of their honour and reputation among sober Persons abroad, who before admired them. The Wool of <HI>England</HI> is of exceeding fineness, of which are made excellent broad cloaths, dispersed over all the World, to the great benefit of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> as well in return of so much Mony which is made of them, as in setting to work so many poor People, who from it receive sustenance.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly gone through the Method of the
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
old Verse, it is time now we should look upon the Men, and they are commonly of a comely Feature, and a gracious Countenance, for the most part grey Eyed, pleasant, beautiful, bountiful, courteous, and much resembling the <HI>Italians</HI> in Habit and Pronunciation; In matters of War they are both able to endure, and rea∣dy to undertake the hardest Enterprises, and for their Courage are deservedly renowned throughout the World. K. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. and his Son did carry their victori∣ous Arms through all <HI>France:</HI> K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. was crowned King at <HI>Paris:</HI> The D. of <HI>Bedford</HI> was Regent of <HI>France,</HI> and being slain in a Battle, was buried in <HI>Roan,</HI> whose Monument when <HI>Charles</HI> 8. K. of <HI>France</HI> came to see, a Nobleman standing by, advised him to raze it, <HI>Nay,</HI> (answered he) <HI>let him rest in peace now being dead, of whom in War, whilest he lived, all</HI> France <HI>stood in fear.</HI> Marshal <HI>Biron</HI> said, <HI>He liked not the</HI> English <HI>March,</HI> (being beaten by the Drum) <HI>because it was so slow;</HI> Sir <HI>Roger Williams,</HI> a gallant Souldier, answered him, <HI>That as slow as it was, yet it had gone through all</HI> France. Our Wooden Walls, the Ships, are a great security to this Nation, the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> having been generally accounted the strongest in the World: What service did our Ships do us in 88. Sir. <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and after him <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>, within the space of Three Years, and Three Months, travelled about the Globe of the whole Earth. Sir <HI>Ri∣chard Greenvill</HI> in a Ship of Q. <HI>Elizabeths</HI> fought against a great Navy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and his single Vessel was fought within turns by 15 other great Ships, whereof the great St. <HI>Philip</HI> of 1500 Tuns, Prince of the 12 Sea Apostles, was one, yet this valiant Knight sunk Two of their best Ships, and killed a Thousand Men: He is called by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> still, <HI>Don Richard</HI> of the <HI>Green∣field,</HI> and they fright their Children with him. Our Na∣tion without Vanity may assume to itself the Praise, con∣sidering its narrow Limits, to have produced as many Schollars, admirable in all degrees of knowledge, as a∣ny Country on this side the <HI>Alps,</HI> and received the Christian Faith as some say from St. <HI>Peter and Paul;</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<HI>Lucius</HI> was the first Christian King of any in <HI>Europe.</HI> Among many other worthy Men, Bishop <HI>Jewel,</HI> Bishop <HI>Andrews,</HI> Bishop <HI>Whitgift,</HI> and Dr. <HI>John Reynolds</HI> are very famous, of the last of whom the following account is very remarkable; this <HI>Jo. Reynolds</HI> had a Brother named <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI> who was at first bred up a Protestant of the Church of <HI>Eng.</HI> and <HI>John</HI> was trained up in Popery beyond the Seas; <HI>William</HI> out of an honest zeal to reduce his Brother to this Church, made a Journey to him, where after a confe∣rence between them, it so fell out that <HI>John</HI> being over∣come by his Brothers Arguments returned into <HI>Eng.</HI> where he became a very strict, and serious Protestant, and <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> being convinced by the reasons of his Brother <HI>John</HI> staid beyond Sea, where he proved a very rigid and violent Papist: of which strange accident Dr. <HI>Alabaster</HI> who had tryed both Religions (and among others had some notable whimsies) made this ingenious Epigram,
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>Bella inter geminos plusquam Civilia fratres,</HI> &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In point of Faith some undetermin'd jars</L>
<L>Betwixt two Brothers kindled Civil Wars;</L>
<L>One for the Churches Reformation stood,</L>
<L>The other thought no Reformation good:</L>
<L>The points propos'd, they traversed the Field</L>
<L>With equal skill, and both together yield.</L>
<L>As they desir'd his Brother each subdues,</L>
<L>Yet such their Fate that each his Faith did lose;</L>
<L>Both Captives, none the Prisoners thence to guide,</L>
<L>The Victor flying to the vanquish't side,</L>
<L>Both joy'd in being Conquer'd (strange to say)</L>
<L>And yet both mourn'd because both won the day.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The Government of <HI>England</HI> is Monarchical, of a per∣fect, and happy Constitution, wherein the King hath his full Prerogative, the Nobles all due respect, and the People amongst other blessings, extreamly happy in this; <HI>That they are Masters of their own purposes, and have a strong hand in making their own Laws.</HI> Of all the Seniories in the World (saith <HI>P. Comines</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Historian) the
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Realm of <HI>England</HI> is the Country where the Common∣wealth is best governed, the People least opprest, and the fewest Houses and Buildings destroyed in Civil War. It is a Country always most Temperate, the Air is thick, and much subject to winds, rain, and dark Clouds, and therefore <HI>Gundamore</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador here in K. <HI>James</HI>'s his time, bid the <HI>Spanish</HI> Post when he came to <HI>Spain</HI> commend him to the Sun, for he had not seen him here a great while, and in <HI>Spain</HI> he should be sure to find him. The Ocean which beateth upon the Coast of this Island aboundeth with all manner of Fish, and the Meadows and Pastures with Corn, Cattle, and all other necessaries; a <HI>Spaniard</HI> boasting, <HI>That they had ex∣cellent Oranges, Lemmons, and Olives growing in their Coun∣trey which ours wanted;</HI> Sir <HI>Roger Williams</HI> reply'd, <HI>It is true</HI> (said he) <HI>they do not grow here, yet all this is but sauce, whereas we have dainty Veal, and well fed Capons to eat with them, with many other delicate Dishes worth the name of Victuals indeed;</HI> There are more Parks, Forrests and Chases in <HI>England</HI> than in all Christendom beside, there are in no place of the World greater and larger Dogs than here, which caused them to be most in request by the <HI>Romans</HI> both for their baitings in their Amphithea∣ters, and in all other their huntings; the <HI>English</HI> Cock is a bold and stout Fowl, and will fight valiantly with his Adversary, and presently crows when he obtains the Victory, which seldom happens till death parts them. There are 44 Shires and Counties in <HI>England,</HI> every Shire consisting of so many Hundreds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and every Hundred of a number of Burroughs, Villages or Ty∣things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this may suffice by way of Preface, the design of this small Tract being not to give a particular, or exact description of every County, and the Towns and Villages therein (since that has been largely perfor∣med by Mr. <HI>Speed,</HI> Mr. <HI>Blome</HI> and others) but only to contract in a little volume, and price, the Natural, and Artificial Curiosities and Rarities in <HI>England, Scot∣land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with Remarks upon some famous Per∣sons and Places, as also an account of the Earthquakes,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Tempests, Seiges, Battels, and other strange Accidents, and Occurrences that have happened in each County, whereby my Countrymen may observe that there is hardly any thing worth wondring at abroad in the world, whereof Nature or Art hath not written a Copy in these Islands; and therefore I shall not confine my self so much to methodize matters as to time, as not to let slip any thing considerable; and because I suppose most Men have a desire to read something of their own Country first, I have (according to the method of Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> and others) placed the Counties Alphabetically for the more ready finding of them, and will therefore begin with</P>
<P><HI>BARKSHIRE</HI> (whether so called from a stri∣ped or bark-bared Oak is uncertain) is bounded by <HI>Wiltshire</HI> on the West, <HI>Hamshire</HI> on the South, <HI>Surry</HI> on the East, <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> on the North there∣of; the air is temperate, sweet, and pleasant, the soil plenteous of Corn, Cattle, Waters, and Woods, so that for profit and pleasure it gives place to none; The most remarkable place in this County is <HI>Windsor Castle,</HI> a most Princely Pallace both for strength and State, and hath in it a Colledge for Learning, a Chappel for Devotion, and an Alms-house of decayed Gentlemen for Charity; it is reported to have been built by K. <HI>Arthur,</HI> and K. <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror was so desirous of it, that by composition with the Abbot of <HI>Westminster,</HI> whose then it was, he made it to be the Kings Possession; in this Castle the Victorious K. <HI>Edward</HI> 3. was born, and herein after he had subdued the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> he kept at one time <HI>John</HI> K. of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scotland</HI> as his Prisoners; after which he graced it with greater Ma∣jesty by instituting the Honourable Order of the Garter, the Institution whereof some ascribe to a Garter occa∣sionally falling from the Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> though others affirm the Garter was given in testimony of that Bond of Love and Affection, wherewith the Knights and Fellows of it were to be bound severally one to ano∣ther,

<P>There is another of the same nature in <HI>Northampton∣shire,</HI> of which hereafter.

This was in the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> 7. In 1506.

In K. <HI>Henry</HI> 3. his Reign, while a Parliament was sitting at <HI>Northampton,</HI> an unsufferable outrage was com∣plained of to them, committed by one <HI>Falcacius</HI> a <HI>Nor∣man</HI> by birth, who seized upon <HI>Henry Braybrook</HI> a Judge, as he was upon the Bench at the Assizes at <HI>Dunstable,</HI> and clapped him close Prisoner in <HI>Bedford-Castle</HI> with a strong Guard upon him, because 30 Verdicts had passed against him upon Tryals at Law for Lands which he had forceably entred upon; the Judges Wife came to the Parliament, and with her Tears and complaints so mo∣ved them with pitty and indignation, that all other mat∣ters laid aside the Clergy, as well as Laity attended the King to besiege the Castle, <HI>Falcacius</HI> being Governor thereof, was gone himself into <HI>Wales</HI> with hopes of raising more Forces to maintain his Rebellion, but had left his Brother Lieutenant in his room, with a despe∣rate crew of Villains, and all manner of Ammunition, and Provision sufficient for a whole years Siege; yet af∣ter 2 Months the Castle was taken by Storm, the Lieu∣tenant and all his Companions hanged, and the Castle it∣self pull'd down to the ground as a den of Thieves, and to deter all others for the future from committing such Villanous and Treasonable Crimes. This <HI>Falcacius</HI> (as we said) was a <HI>French-man</HI> born, and a Bastard, and came o∣ver in K. <HI>Johns</HI> time in a very mean condition, by whom for his Courage he was made Governor of <HI>Bedford Castle,</HI> to defend it against the Barons; where by plunder and Rapine, he got a great deal of mony together, K. <HI>John</HI>

In the 7th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth; Henry Cheyney,</HI> High Sheriff of <HI>Bed∣fordshire</HI> was created Baron of <HI>Tuddington</HI> in this County, in his Youth he was very wild and ventrous, witness his playing at Dice with <HI>Henry</HI> 2.

In 1665. <HI>Jan.</HI> 20. about six a clock at night there was an Earthquake in some parts of <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> which was attended with an unusual kind of noise in the Air, but was quickly over; it much frighted some People on the sudden, to feel their Chairs and Stools quake under them, and to hear Tables, and such things to clatter in the rooms; and the whole House to shake, this Information (saith Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his Examp. p. 2.)

but if we believe reports, there is a more easy way, and that is by Dreams, by which it's said, works of great va∣lue have been found; as in K. <HI>Edward</HI> 6th time, a Gen∣tlewoman (Heiress to one <HI>Titsculiard</HI>) dreamed, a hand∣some man told her, that in such a Tenement of her Land she should find Tinn enough to inrich her self and her posterity; who telling her Husband, upon Tryal he found a Tinnwork there, which in 4 years was worth to him almost 4000 pounds; it is said likewise that one <HI>Taprel</HI> of St. <HI>Niot,</HI> by a dream of his Daughters was wished to such a place, which he farmed of the Lord of the Soil, and found a Tinnwork accor∣dingly, which made him a rich man; which Stories if true make much for the credit of Womens dreams. From the bottom of the Tinn-works if they be of any depth, you may see the Stars at noon-day in clear wea∣ther; the labour is so hard, and tedious, that they can∣not work above 4 hours in a day, they sometimes meet with loose earth, yet otherwhile they light upon such hard Rocks, that a good workman can scarce hew above a foot in a week; sometimes again they meet with great streams of water, and sometimes with stinking damps that distemper their heads for the present, though not dangerously; I hear of no Medicinal Water in this Countrey, but only one, and since he that telleth a mi∣raculous truth, must always carry the Author at his back (saith my Author) I will transcribe the words of B. <HI>Hall</HI> in his <HI>Myst. of Godliness,</HI> speaking of the good Of∣fices of Angels to Gods Servants; <HI>Of this kind,</HI> saith he, <HI>was that no less than miraculous cure which at St.</HI> Maderns <HI>in</HI> Cornwall, <HI>was wrought upon a poor Cripple, whereof besides the attestation of many Hundreds of the Neighbours, I took a strict and impartial examination in my last Visitation; this man for</HI> 16 <HI>years together was fain to walk upon his hands, by reason the sinews of his legs were so contracted, and upon Monitions in his dream to wash in that Well, was suddenly so restored to his Limbs, that I saw him able both to walk, and get his own maintenance, I found here was neither Art nor Col∣lusion the thing done, the Invisible Author being God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="20"/>In this County there are some stones called <HI>Hurlers,</HI> at a competent distance from each other, which are vainly reported to be men transformed into Stones; in St. <HI>Cleers</HI> Parish there are upon a Plain 6 or 8 Stones, such as are upon <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, which like them too, will be mistaken in the telling: near <HI>Helford</HI> is a Rock lying on the ground, the top whereof is hollow like the long half of an Egg, this they say holdeth water, which ebbeth and floweth with the Sea, and <HI>indeed,</HI> saith the Author, <HI>when I came hither to see this Curiosity the Tide was half gone, and the Pit or hollowness half empty,</HI> There is a rock in this County called <HI>Mainamber,</HI> erected as some conceive by <HI>Ambrosius</HI> that Valiant <HI>Brittain</HI> upon some Victory obtained by him against the <HI>Romans,</HI> or other Enemies; this is a Masterpiece of Mathematicks, and Critical Proportions, being a great Stone of so exact position on the top of a Rock that the push of a Fin∣ger will sensibly move it to and fro, and yet all the strength that men could make, was not thought sufficient to remove it out of the place; but know Reader (saith Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI>) that this wonder is now unwondred, for I am credibly informed that some Souldiers of late have utterly destroyed it, which shews how dangerous it is for Art to stand in the way of ignorance, surely Cove∣tousness could not tempt them to it, though it was the ruine of a fair Monument in <HI>Turky,</HI> where a Tomb was erected near the Highway (according to the fashion of that Country) on some Person of Quality, consisting of a Pillar, and on the top thereof a Chapiter or great Globe of Stone, whereon was written in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language; <HI>The Brains are in the Head;</HI> this stood many years undemolished (it being very criminal there to violate the Monuments of the dead) till one of less conscience, but more cunning than others, passing by it, resolved to unriddle the meaning of this Inscrip∣tion, and breaking the hollow Globe open, found it full of Gold, and departed the richer, though not the hone∣ster; certainly if any such temptation invited the Soul∣diers to this Act they missed their mark therein.</P>

<P>Yet these People have sometimes abused their valour to Rebellion, as in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. where upon the account of raising a subsidy granted by Parliament a∣gainst the <HI>Scots,</HI> they made a commotion, the Ringleaders being <HI>Thomas Flammock</HI> a Lawyer, and <HI>Mi∣chael Joseph</HI> a Smith, who having assembled an Army, went to <HI>Taunton,</HI> where they slew the Provost <HI>Peryn,</HI> one of the Commissioners of the Subsidy, and marching for∣ward, <HI>James Tutchet,</HI> Lord <HI>Audly</HI> joined with them, and took on him to be their Leader, at last they came to <HI>Black-Heath</HI> (intending to come to the King at <HI>London</HI>) and there incamped on the top of the Hill; the King sent the Earls of <HI>Oxford, Essex, Suffolk,</HI> and others to in∣compass the Hill, that so none might escape, and him∣self incamping in Sr. <HI>Georges Fields,</HI> he sent the Lord <HI>Dawbeny</HI> to set upon them, who won <HI>Debtford Bridge</HI>

from them, though strongly defended, their Arrows being reported to be a full yard in length, and assaulting them every way, killed 2000, and took many Prisoners, divers of whom the King pardoned, but none of the Leaders; the L. <HI>Audly</HI> was drawn from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Tow∣er-Hill</HI> in a Coat of his own Arms drawn upon Paper, reversed, and all torn, and there beheaded; <HI>Thomas Flammock</HI> and <HI>Michael Joseph</HI> were drawn, hang'd and quartered, and their quarters set upon stakes.

<P>They were likewise guilty of another Rebellion in the 2. of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 6, 1549. for injunctions being sent forth by that pious Prince for removing Images out of Churches, and that the Ministers should dissuade the People from praying to Saints, for for the dead, from use of Beeds, Ashes, and Processions, from Masses Dir∣ges, praying in an unknown Tongue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when Commissio∣ners went abroad to see them executed, Mr. <HI>Body</HI> a Commissioner as he was pulling down Images in <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> was suddenly stabbed with a knife into the body by a Popish Priest; hereupon the People flockt together from several parts of this Shire, and taking Arms, com∣mitted divers outrages, as they did also in several other Counties; these Religious Mutineers sent several Articles to the King, and among other things required to have the <HI>Latine</HI> Mass again, and the six Articles in K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. time (called the bloody Articles) revived again; now though the King knew reasons would little prevail with unreasonable men, yet he sent them answers in writing, and a general Pardon if they would desist, and lay down their Arms; the answer about the 6 Articles is worth re∣hearsing; <HI>You require,</HI> saith the King, <HI>to have the Statute of the</HI> 6 <HI>Articles revived, do you know what you ask?

Laws were indeed made, but as soon repented of, for they were too cruel and bloody to be endured by our People; oh poor Igno∣rant Subjects, how are you insnared and deceived by subtle Traitors? We out of pity took them away, beeause they were bloody, and you out of Ignorance desire them again, you know full well they made us to be cruel and severe, and gave us cause to draw our Sword very often; they were like a whetstone to our Sword, and for your sakes only we left off to use them; and since our mercy inclineth us to write our Laws in Milk and Equity, how come you to be so blinded as to desire they should be writ in blood? But assure your selves and be confident, that we make account of nothing under Heaven so much as this, to have our Laws obeyed, and this cause of God which we have underta∣ken to be throughly maintained, from which we will never re∣move a hairs breadth, nor give place to any Creature living, much less to any Subject, but therein we will venture our own Royal Person, our Crown, Treasure, Realm, and all our Estate, whereof we assure you of our high honour; and as to the Com∣mon Prayer which you are against, it cannot certainly offend any reasonable man that the service of God is changed from an unknown Tongue, since it is only to make him understand what before he knew not, and thereby to give his consent to those Pray∣ers which he hath most need of, and to affect his Conscience therewith, since God requireth the heart only, and that we should offer a reasonable Service to him.</HI> He concludes; <HI>We for our parts desire to live no longer than to be a Father to our People, and as God hath made us your Rightful King, so hath he com∣manded you to be obedient, by whose great Majesty we solemnly protest, you shall feel the Power of the same God in our Sword, which how mighty it is, no Subject knoweth, how puissant no private man can judge, and how mortal no</HI> English <HI>heart can think; therefore imbrace our Mercy while it is offered, lest the blood spilt by your means cry for vengeance from the Earth, and be heard in the ears of the Lord in Heaven.</HI> But the Rebels grew still more outragious, coming before the City of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and demanding entrance; which being refused, they endeavoured to take it by storm, and firing the Gates, and Mining, but all in vain, yet they lay so long before it, that the Citizens within suffered great want of

Victuals, making bread of the courfest bran, and fee∣ding upon Horseflesh, in which extremity an aged Citi∣zen bringing forth all his Provisions to the People, told them, <HI>That as he communicated to them his store, so he would partake with them in their wants, and that he would feed upon one Arm, and fight with the other before he would consent to put the City into the hands of the Seditious;</HI> but the L. <HI>Grey,</HI> and the L. <HI>Russel</HI> after many conflicts with the Rebels forced them to raise the Seige, and utterly routed them; the Sedition being thus suppressed, it is memorable what cruel sport Sir <HI>William Kingston</HI> the Provost Marshal made, by virtue of his Office upon men in misery; one <HI>Boyer</HI> Mayor of <HI>Bodmin</HI> in <HI>Cornwall</HI> had been amongst the Rebels, not willingly, but inforced; to him the Pro∣vost sent word he would come and dine with him, for whom the Mayor made great Provision; a little before Dinner the Provost took the Mayor aside, and whispered him in the ear, <HI>That an Execution must be that day done in the Town,</HI> and therefore required to have a pair of Gallows set up against Dinner was done; the Mayor provided them accordingly, presently after Din∣ner the Provost taking the Mayor by the hand, intrea∣ted him to shew him the place where the Gallows was, which when he beheld, he asked the Mayor, if he thought them to be strong enough; <HI>yes,</HI> said the Mayor, <HI>doubtless they are; well then,</HI> said the Provost, <HI>get you up speedily for they are provided for you: I hope,</HI> said the Mayor, <HI>you do not mean as you speak; In faith,</HI> saies the Provost, <HI>there is no Remedy, for you have been a busie Rebel;</HI> and so without respite or defence he was hanged to death; a most un∣courteous part for a Guest to offer his Host. Near the same place dwelt a Miller that had been very active in that Rebellion; who fearing the approach of the Mar∣shal, told a sturdy Fellow his Servant, that he had occa∣sion to go from home, and if any man should inquire for the Miller, he bid him say, that himself was the Miller, and had been so for 3 years before; soon after the Provost came, and called for the Miller, when out comes the Servant, and said he was the man, the Provost
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>
demanded how long he had kept the Mill: <HI>These</HI> 3 <HI>years,</HI> answered the Servant; the Provost then commanded his men to lay hold of him, and hang him on the next Tree; at this the Fellow cried out, <HI>That he was not the Miller, but the Millers Man; Nay Sir,</HI> said the Provost, <HI>I will take you at your word, and if thou beest the Miller, thou art a busie Knave; if thou beest not, thou art a false lying Knave, and however thou canst never do thy Master better service than to hang for him,</HI> and so without more ado he was dis∣patched.</P>
<P>I will conclude the Remarks of this County with somewhat more Comical. At the Dissolution of Abbeys K. <HI>Ken.</HI> 8. gave away large shares to almost every one that asked: Amongst other Instances take this merry story. It happened that two or three Gentlemen, the Kings servants, waited at the door, where the King was to come out, with a design to beg a large parcel of Ab∣by Lands; One Mr. <HI>John Champernoun,</HI> another of his servants, seeing them, was very inquisitive to know their suit, but they would not impart it to him; in the mean time out comes the King, they kneel down, so doth <HI>Champernoun,</HI> (being assured by an implicit Faith that Courtiers beg nothing hurtful to themselves) they present their Petition, the King grants it, they render him humble thanks, so doth Mr. <HI>Champernoun;</HI> after∣ward he requires his share; they deny it; he appeals to the King, who avows, <HI>that he meant they should have equal shares;</HI> whereupon his Companions were forced to allot him the Priory of St. <HI>German</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> valued at 243 pound a Year; so that a dumb Beggar met with a blind Giver, the one as little knowing what he asked as the other what he gave. This County is divided into nine Hundreds, wherein are 22 Market Towns, and 161 Pa∣rish Churches: It elects 44 Members to sit in Parlia∣ment, and is in the Diocess of <HI>Exeter.</HI></P>

King <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st dyed at <HI>Carlile</HI> in this County; for intending to invade <HI>Scotland,</HI> he raised a great Army, which he ordered to attend him at this City; but falling sick, and being sen∣sible it would be his death, he commanded his Son (af∣terward <HI>Edward</HI> 2.) to be brought into his presence, to whom he left many good Precepts and Admonitions, exhorting him, <HI>To be merciful, just, and courteous, constant and true both in Word and Deed, that he should be pitiful to those in misery, that he should carry his bones with him about</HI> Scotland <HI>till he had subdued it;</HI> and that he should <HI>send his Heart into the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>with Sevenscore Knights, and Thirty two thousand Pound of Silver, which he had provided for that purpose; lastly, that upon pain of eternal damnation the said Money should not be expended upon any other use:</HI> soon after which he died.</P>
<P>In the 17th Year of this Kings Reign the City of <HI>Car∣lile,</HI> with the Abby, and all the Houses belonging to the <HI>Friers Minors,</HI> were consumed with fire. In the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a rich Vein of most pure and native Brass was found at <HI>Keswrick</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> which had lain neglected a long time. In <HI>April</HI> 1651, about 5 a Clock in the Afternoon, there was a general Earthquake in the Counties of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Westmerland,</HI> where∣with the People were so affrighted, that many of them forsook their Houses, and some Houses were so shaken, that the Chimneys fell down: Presently after the <HI>Scot∣tish</HI> Army came into <HI>England</HI> to assist the Parliament, it rained Blood which covered the Church and Church-Yard of <HI>Bencastle</HI> in this County.

<P>The Sea hath eaten a great part of the Land away up∣on the shores of these Western Shires, and Trees are sometimes discovered, when the Wind blows at low Water, else they are covered over with Sands, and the People thereabout say that they dig up Trees without boughs out of the mossy places in this Shire, which they find by the direction of the Dew in Summer, which they observe never falls on the ground under which they lie. Some Emperick Chirurgions in <HI>Scotland</HI> take a jour∣ney to the <HI>Picts Wall</HI> the beginning of every Summer, to gather vulnerary Plants, which they say grow plenti∣fully there, and are very effectual, being sown and plant∣ed by the <HI>Romans</HI> for Chirurgical Uses. There is a small Burrough called <HI>Solway Frith,</HI> under which, within the very <HI>Frith</HI> or Bay, the Inhabitants report the <HI>Engl sh</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> fought with their Fleets at full Sea, and also with their Horsemen and Footmen at the Ebb.

The most remarkable thing in this County is the Peak, where∣in there is a Cave called the <HI>Devils Arse,</HI> which is a great Rock or Castle upon an high hill, under which there is a Cave in the ground of a vast bigness; the name is oc∣casioned by reason it seems to have two Buttocks stick∣ing out like a Mans, bending to the ground, the Arch of the Rock is very high, and through it drops of wa∣ter fall; having good store of Lights they enter into it, and going between two Rocks near together, lose the sight of day, the passage is so low, that they are fain to creep on their hands and knees, they then come to a dark River which runs slowly; beyond which they can∣not pass; there is another high hill called <HI>Maim Tour,</HI> or <HI>Mam Tor,</HI> called so (saith one) because maimed, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roken at the top, and looks like an old ruined wall, from which the Sand falls continually down, and yet the hill is not in the least diminished, having as it seems a spring of matter from whence it is recruited.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Hugh Willoughby</HI> was born of a worthy and ancient Family at <HI>Risely</HI> in this County; In the Reign of K. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> 6. he was imployed by the King and the Mer∣chants of <HI>London</HI> to find out the <HI>North East passage</HI> to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> having three Ships provided for that purpose with a large Commission, which did not bear date from the Year of our Lord, but from the Year of the World 5515, because in their long Voyage they might have occasion to present it to foreign Princes: They depart∣ed from <HI>Deptford May</HI> 10. 1553, and after much fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weather steered North-North-West; but <HI>Aug.</HI> 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tempest arose, whereby one of the Ships was divided

from the rest, and they never saw it again: Sir <HI>Hugh</HI> holding on his Course discovered a Land, which for Ice he could not come near in the Latitude of 72 Degrees; This was then called <HI>Willoughby</HI>'s Land, as well it might, since it had neither then nor since any Owner or Inha∣bitant pretending to the propriety thereof; It appear∣eth by a Will found in that Ship, which was the <HI>Admiral,</HI> in the Pocket of a Person of Quality, that in <HI>January</HI> 1554. Sir <HI>Hugh,</HI> and most of his company, were then in health, though all soon after frozen to death in a River or Haven, called <HI>Arzina</HI> in <HI>Lapland:</HI> The next Summer some other English Ships coming to the same place, found the Ship intire, and all the men frozen to death, with a particular account of all the passages of their Voy∣age. <HI>Lapland</HI> hath several times since been surrounded by the <HI>English,</HI> the West part whereof belongeth to the K. of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the East to the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> they are ge∣nerally Heathens, as poor in Knowledge as Estate, pay∣ing their Tribute in Furs, whose little houses are but great holes, wherein they generally live in the Ignorance of Money. Here let me insert a passage to refresh the Reader after this sad story: There is a custom in this barbarous Country, (as credible Merchants, who have been Eye-witnesses, report) that it is death to marry a maid without her Parents and Friends consent; there∣fore if any man have an affection for a Maid, a day is appointed for both of their Friends to meet, and see the young couple run a Race; the Maid hath the advantage of starting, and a third part of the Race, so that it is im∣possible, except she be willing her self, she should ever be overtaken; if the Maid outrun her Sweet-heart the bu∣siness is ended, he must never have her, nor make any further motion to her under a great penalty; but if the Virgin have any affection for him, though she at first may run hard to try the truth of his Love, yet she will pretend to stumble, or make a voluntary halt, before she comes to the end of the Race, so that he may over∣take her: Thus none are compelled to marry against their Wills, which is the cause that in this poor Country the
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>
married People are richer in their own content than in other Lands, where so many forced matches make feigned Love and cause real unhappiness.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1660, about <HI>Chesterfield</HI> it rained white Ashes, which fell in such quantities, that several Fields lookt white as if Snow had covered them. The same Year, <HI>Nov.</HI> 20. the River <HI>Derwent</HI> was at <HI>Derby,</HI> and 5 Miles above, and 5 Miles below that Town, for 3 or 4 hours totally dried up, so that no water during that time came to any of the Mills upon the River; the Boats were all on ground, and the Fishes upon the Sand, so that the Children took them up in their hands, and in several places the people went over the Channel dryshod, which is more remarkable, because <HI>Derwent</HI> is an inland River, and never ebbs or flows, and it is at <HI>Derby</HI> generally an 100 Foot broad, and 7 or 8 Foot deep, and is an ex∣traordinary quick, fierce stream.

<P>But it is more certain, and withal more lamentable, that the <HI>Danes</HI> first entred at <HI>Teignemouth</HI> to invade this Land about 787, unto whom <HI>Brightrick</HI> King of the West Saxons sent the Steward of his house to know their demands, whom they villanously slew, yet were they forced back to their Ships by the Inhabitants.

that would not stand or speak, he should not fail to kill him whosoever he were.</HI> Having thus provided, and intend∣ing to end his doleful Days, he in a dark night conveyed himself secretly out of his house, and walked alone in his Park; the Keeper in his Circuit hearing one stirring and coming toward him, asked, who was there, but no answer being made, he commanded him to stand, which when he would not do, the Keeper shot him dead, and coming to see who it was, found it to be his Master. In 1588. <HI>Twiford</HI> was burnt down, occasioned by burning straw in a Chimney, which fired the House, and so the Town about one Afternoon, the fury where∣of was so great, that in an hour and an half it consumed 400 Houses, to the loss of an Hundred and fifty thousand pounds, in Money, Plate, Merchandise, Houshold-stuff, and Houses; Fifty persons, Men, Women, and Chil∣dren, were consumed therein, yet through Divine Pro∣vidence, an Almshouse, with several poor people there∣in, was preserved, almost in the midst of the flames.</P>
<P>In the Year 1638. <HI>Oct.</HI> 21. being <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Pa∣rish Church of <HI>Withy Comb,</HI> during Sermon time there happened a very great darkness, which still increased, so that they could not see to read; soon after a terrible and fearful Thunder was heard, like the noise of many great Guns, accompanied with dreadful Lightning, to the great amazement of the People, the Darkness still increasing that they could not see each other, when there presently came such an extraordinary flame of Lightning, as filled the Church with Fire, smoak and a loathsome smell like Brimstone; a Ball of fire came in likewise at the Window, and passed through the Church, which so affrighted the Congregation, that most of them fell down in their Seats, some upon their knees, others on their faces, and some one upon another, crying out of burning and scalding, and all giving up themselves for dead: Mr. <HI>George Lyde,</HI> Minister of the Parish, was in his Pulpit, and though much astonished, yet through Divine Mercy, had no harm, but was a sad spectator of the hurt and sufferings of others, the Lightning seizing on his
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>
Wife, and burning her Cloaths, and many parts of her Body, and another Gentlewoman by her in the same manner, but her Maid and Child sitting at the Pue door had no hurt; another Woman attempting to run out of the Church, had her Cloaths set on fire, and was mise∣rably scorched and burnt, and her Flesh torn off her back, almost to the very bones; another Woman had her flesh so torn, and her Body so terribly burnt that she died the same Night. One Master <HI>Hill</HI> had his head suddenly struck against the Wall in his seat, with such violence, that he dyed the same night, no other hurt being observed, his Son sitting by him received no hurt; at the same Instance another man had his Head cloven, his Skull rent into 3 pieces, and his Brains thrown upon the ground whole, the Hair of his Head, through the violence of the blow, stuck fast to a Pillar near him; some Seats in the Body of the Church were turned up∣side down, yet those which sate in them had little or no hurt: One man going out of the Chancel door, his Dog ran before him, who was whirled about toward the door, and fell down stark dead, upon which the Master step∣ped back, and was preserved: The Church itself was much torn and defaced with the Thunder and Light∣ning, a Beam whereof breaking in the midst, fell down between the Minister and Clark, and hurt neither; the Steeple was much rent, and it was observed where the Church was most rent, there the least hurt was done a∣mong the People; there were none hurt with the Tim∣ber or Stones, but one Maid, who it was judged was killed by the falling of a Stone, which might easily hap∣pen, since Stones were thrown down from the Steeple as fast as if it had been by an 100 Men: A Pinnacle of the Tower being thrown down, beat through into the Church; The Pillar against which the Pulpit stood be∣ing newly whited was turned black and sulphury; there were in all 3 persons killed, and 62 hurt, divers of them having their Linnen burnt, though their outward Gar∣ments were not so much as singed; The Lightning be∣ing past, and the People in a terrible Maze, a Gentle∣man

in the Town stood up and said, <HI>Neighbours in the name of God shall we venture out of the Church?</HI> To whom the Minister answered, <HI>Let us make an end with Prayer, for it is better to dye here than in another place;</HI> But the Peo∣ple looking about them, and seeing the Church so terri∣bly rent and torn over their heads, durst not proceed in the publick Devotions, but went out of the Church. At the same time there were strange accidents else where; for a bowling Ally near the Church-yard was turned in∣to Pits and Heaps, as if plowed. And at <HI>Brixton</HI> near <HI>Plimouth</HI> at that time fell Hailstones as big as an ordina∣ry Turkey-Egg, some of 5, 6, and 7 Ounces weight: And it was discoursed, that the like Judgment happened at <HI>Norton</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire;</HI> the truth of these things was attested by the Minister, and diverse Inhabitants pre∣sent.</P>
<P>This County is divided into 33 Hundreds, wherein are 32 Market Towns, and 394 Parish Churches: Out of it are elected 26 Parliament Men; it is in the Diocess of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and gives the Title of Earl to <HI>William</HI> L. <HI>Ca∣vendish,</HI> as <HI>Exeter</HI> doth to <HI>John</HI> L. <HI>Cecil.</HI></P>
<P>DORSETSHIRE hath <HI>Devonshire</HI> on the West, <HI>Somerset</HI> and <HI>Wiltshire</HI> on the North, <HI>Hantshire</HI> on the East, and the narrow Seas on the South: It abounds in Wheat, Cattle, Wool, Kersies, and all other commo∣dities necessary for the Life of Man; <HI>Dorchester</HI> is the chief Market Town, which was formerly walled, where∣of some part yet standeth, especially upon the west and South sides; the Tract or Trench whereof in the man∣ner of a Quadrant, contains 1700 paces, but was de∣stroyed by the <HI>Danes.</HI> Other places are memorable for the Actions happening therein, though nothing now but Ruines, as <HI>Badbury</HI> now a Trench and decayed Castle only, though sometimes the Court of the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> Kings; such also is <HI>Cerne,</HI> where <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk, broke down the Altars and Idols of the <HI>Saxon</HI> God <HI>Hell,</HI> whom they devoutly worshipped as the preserver of their health; <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> likewise, wherein one <HI>Aquila,</HI> (ei∣ther

Man or Eagle) is reported to have prophecied of future times; In this City <HI>Edward,</HI> son of <HI>Edgar</HI> (who was murdered at <HI>Corf-Castle</HI> by his Step-Mother, to make way for her own Son,) was buried.</P>
<P>In the Reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 2 the great Earl of <HI>Lan∣caster</HI> married a Lady from <HI>Camford</HI> in this County, who was taken out of his house by one <HI>Richard Martin</HI> a de∣formed lame Dwarf, who challenged her for his Wife, alledging he had lain with her before the Earl married her, whereupon the Lady was examined, who volunta∣rily confessed it was all true, and thereupon the ugly Fellow in her right claimed the Two Earldoms of <HI>Lin∣coln</HI> and <HI>Salisbury.</HI> In the Fourth of this Kings Reign the Church of <HI>Middleton,</HI> with all the Monuments, were con∣sumed with Lightning, the Monks being at Mattens. In the 22d of <HI>Edward</HI> 3. a Plague was brought from be∣yond Sea into the Towns and Villages of <HI>England,</HI> on the Seacosts of <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> which raged so, both there and in other parts of <HI>England,</HI> that scarce the Tenth man was left alive in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>In 1506. King <HI>Philip</HI> sailing out of <HI>Germany</HI> to take pos∣session of the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> was driven by Tempest upon the Coasts of <HI>England,</HI> and landed at <HI>Weymouth</HI> to refresh himself, and was invited by Sir <HI>Tho. Trenchard,</HI> a worthy Knight of that County, to his House, who im∣mediately sent word to King <HI>Henry</HI> 7. of his Arrival, who, glad to have his Court honoured by so great a Prince, sent the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> at present to wait upon him till himself should follow; the Earl attended him with a gallant Troop of about 300 Horse, and for more state came to him by Torch light; upon this Message, though K. <HI>Philip</HI> had many reasons to hasten his Journy, yet not to distaste K. <HI>Henry,</HI> he came Post to <HI>Windsor,</HI> where after great and magnificent Entertainment, K. <HI>Henry</HI> taking an opportunity, when they were both in a private room, laying his Hand civilly upon K. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Arm, said, <HI>Sir, you have been saved upon my Coast, I hope you will not suffer me to wreck upon yours:</HI> The King of <HI>Castile</HI> asking him what he meant, <HI>I mean,</HI> saith the King, <HI>that

hair-brain'd Fellow the Earl of</HI> Suffolk, <HI>who being my Sub∣ject is protected in your Country, and begins to play the Fool when all others are weary of it.</HI> The King of <HI>Castile</HI> answer∣ed, <HI>I had thought Sir your felicity had been above these thoughts; but if it trouble you I will banish him.</HI> K. <HI>Henry</HI> answered, <HI>That his desire was to have him delivered to him;</HI> with this the King of <HI>Castile</HI> a little confused, said, <HI>That can I not do with my honour: Well then,</HI> said the King, <HI>the matter is at an end;</HI> at last the King of <HI>Castile</HI> who much esteemed K. <HI>Henry,</HI> composing his Countenance, said, <HI>Sir, you shall have him; but upon your honour you shall not take his Life: I promise it upon my honour,</HI> said K. <HI>Henry;</HI> and he kept his promise, for he was not put to death du∣ring all his Reign; but yet he took such order, that in the Reign of his Son K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. he had his Head cut off. This Earl of <HI>Suffolk</HI> had lately gone over to <HI>Flanders</HI> to the Lady <HI>Margret,</HI> K. <HI>Henry</HI>'s sworn Enemy, which made the King doubt of his Intentions: The Earl was accordingly brought over, and sent to the Tower, and after K. <HI>Philip</HI> had received the Order of the Garter, and Prince <HI>Henry</HI> that of the Golden Fleece, the King of <HI>Castile</HI> departed home.</P>
<P>In the 26. of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> 1558. at a place called <HI>Black∣more,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Armitage,</HI> in this County, a piece of ground containing 3 Acres, removed from its place, and went quite over another Close, with the Trees and Fences thereon, a great way off, stopping up an High∣way which led to <HI>Cerne,</HI> the same Hedges inclosing it as before, and the Trees standing very upright thereon, onely one Oak of almost 20 Load fell down; in the place from whence it removed there remained a great deep Pit. In 1613. <HI>Aug.</HI> 7. The Town of <HI>Dorchester</HI> was utterly consumed with Fire, which began in the house of a Tallow-Chandler, and destroyed the whole Town, save a few Houses near the Church, and all their Wares and Goods, to the value of Two Hundred Thou∣sand Pounds, yet no man perished therein. In <HI>June,</HI> 1653. a black Cloud was seen over the Town of <HI>Pool,</HI> and soon after dissolved into a shower of Blood, which
<PB N="60" REF="34"/>
fell warm upon mens hands, some green leaves with those drops upon them were sent to <HI>London,</HI> and seen by many. The Forrest of the <HI>White Hart</HI> is in this County, so called, because in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> 3. the King came hither to hunt, and having taken other Deer, he spared a most beautiful and goodly white Heart, which after∣ward <HI>Thomas de Lynd</HI> a Gentleman of this Country with others in his Company took and killed, for which the King put a mulct or Fine upon him, and the whole County, and the very lands which they held, pay even to this day every year by way of amercement a sum of Mony into the Exchequer, which is called <HI>White Hart Silver; My self,</HI> saith Dr. <HI>Fuller, have paid a share for the sauce, who never tasted any of the meat, so that it seems Kings Venison is sooner eaten than digested.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ignatius Jordan</HI> was born at <HI>Lime Regis</HI> in this County; and when he was young, was sent to <HI>Exeter,</HI> to be brought up a Merchant; in this City having passed through the several inferiour Offices, he at last came to be Mayor, and was a Justice of Peace 24 years together; yet his beginning was but very mean, which he was al∣ways ready to acknowledg for when some threatned him with Law-suits, and <HI>that they would not give over while he was worth a groat,</HI> he cheerfully told them, <HI>That he should be then but two pence poorer, than when he came first to</HI> Exeter, <HI>for,</HI> said he, <HI>I brought but six pence with me hither;</HI> He would often say, <HI>He wondred what rich men meant, that they gave so little to the Poor, and yet raked so much together for their Children; do you not see,</HI> said he, <HI>what becomes of it?</HI> and would reckon up divers examples of such as heaped up much for their Children, and they in a short time con∣sumed it all; on the other side, he spoke of such as had small beginnings, and afterward became rich, or of a competent Estate, giving a particular instance of him∣self, <HI>I came,</HI> said he, <HI>but with a groat or sixpence in my purse to this City, had I had a shilling in my purse, I had never been Mayor of</HI> Exeter. In his Troubles in the Star Chamber, when one told him, <HI>he was sorry that the Lord Keeper was against him;</HI> He answered, <HI>I have a greater Lord Keeper than
<PB N="61" REF="34"/>
him, the Lord is my Keeper, I will not be afraid,</HI> He was fa∣mous for Justice and Charity in his life, and at his death left very large Legacies to the poor, both of that City and County; he died in 1640.</P>
<P>This County is divided into 29 Hundreds, wherein are 19 Market Towns, and 248 Parish Churches.

<P><HI>DƲRHAM.</HI> This Bishoprick hath <HI>Northumberland</HI> on the North, divided by the Rivers <HI>Derwent and Tyne;</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire</HI> on the South; the <HI>German</HI> Ocean on the East; <HI>Cumberland and Westmoreland</HI> on the West; it abounds with Coals, Lead and Iron; near <HI>Darlington</HI> in this County, whose waters are warm, there are three Pits wonderful deep, cal∣led <HI>Hell Kettles;</HI> these are judged to come of an Earth∣quake which happened in 1179. For on <HI>Christmas day</HI> say our Chronicles at <HI>Oxenhall,</HI> which is this place, the ground heaved up aloft like a Tower, and so continued all that day, as it were immoveable, till evening, and then fell with so horrible a noise, that it affrighted the Inhabi∣tants thereabout, and the Earth swallowing it up, made in the same place three deep Pits; it is reported that Bishop <HI>Tonstall</HI> put a Goose into one of these Pits, ha∣ving first given her a mark, and the same Goose was found in the River <HI>Tees,</HI> which if true, these Kettles have passages under ground; within the River <HI>Weer</HI> at <HI>Butterby</HI> near <HI>Durham,</HI> in Summer Time their issues a salt reddish water, which the Sun makes white, and growing thick becomes Salt, which the People thereabout always use.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, one <HI>Wolstan</HI> was Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> whom upon <HI>Lanfranks</HI> reporting to be insufficient for the place, for want of Learning, the King commanded to put off his Pontifical Robes, and to leave his Bishoprick, when suddenly out of Divine In∣spiration, saith our Historian, <HI>Wolston</HI> answered, <HI>A better
<PB N="62" REF="35"/>
then you O King bestowed these Robes upon me, and to him will I restore them;</HI> and therewithal going to <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessors Shrine, who had made him a Bishop, and putting off his Robes, he struck his Staff upon St. <HI>Ed∣wards</HI> Monument, which stuck so fast, saith the Author, in the Stone of it, that by no strength it could be drawn forth, till he pluckt it out himself, which so terrified both <HI>Lanfrank</HI> and the King, that they intreated him to take his Robes again, and keep his Bishoprick.</P>
<P>When K. <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. was Victorious in <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> with <HI>David Bruce</HI> their King (by the incite∣ment of the <HI>French</HI> King) invade <HI>England</HI> with an Ar∣my of Threescore and two Thousand Men, and marched as far as <HI>Durham,</HI> supposing that none but Priests and Shepheards, were left at home, because such a vast num∣ber were abroad upon Service; but they found it other∣wise, for the Lords in the North, as <HI>Gilbert Ʋmfrevile,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Angus, Henry Piercy, Ralph Nevil, William Dayncourt,</HI> with the Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> and others of the Clergy, gathered such great Forces, and ordered them so well, that by the anima∣tion of Queen <HI>Philip,</HI> who though big with Child, rode in Person through the <HI>English</HI> Troops, and with wise and gracious words incouraged them, that they obtained a very signal Victory; for meeting the Scots at <HI>Nevils</HI> Cross in this Bishoprick, they utterly defeated their great Army, and took <HI>David</HI> their King Prisoner, with the Earls of <HI>Fife, Menteith, Murray, Sutherland, Dowglas,</HI> the Archbishop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> and others, and slew fif∣teen thousand <HI>Scots;</HI> who yet could not be charged for want of valour, especially the King himself, who had two Spears hanging in his body, his leg desperately wounded with an Arrow, his Sword and other weapons beaten out of his hand; and yet disdaining to be taken Captive, endeavoured by provoking language to induce the <HI>English</HI> to kill him, and therefore when one <HI>John Copland,</HI> Captain of <HI>Roxborough</HI> Castle, advised him to yeild, the King struck him so fiercely over the face with his Gauntlet, as beat out two of his Teeth; but since he
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>
could not force a death, he must submit to be a Prisoner, and was conveyed by <HI>Copland,</HI> and eight of his Servants out of the Field; the Queen retired to <HI>Newcastle</HI> to at∣tend the event of the Battle, and understanding that K. <HI>David</HI> was taken, she sent Letters to the Captain to de∣liver up his Royal Prisoner, which he refusing, she sends over a complaint to K. <HI>Edward;</HI> who ordered him to come to <HI>Calice,</HI> where he made so discreet a defence, that he was sent back, and had 500 pound a year in Land given him in any place which he should chuse near his own dwelling, with order to deliver up his Prisoner to the Queen, which he did accordingly at <HI>York</HI> with such a modest and ingenious Apology, as satisfied both the Queen and the Lords of the Council. King <HI>David</HI> was committed Prisoner to the Tower, and continued so e∣leven years, and then was set at liberty upon condition to pay one hundred thousand Marks in ten years, as a Ransom.</P>
<P><HI>Cicely Nevil,</HI> whose Fathers vast Estate, afforded him a Mansion House for every week in the year, cannot be here omitted, as being the clearest instance of humane frail felicity; she was youngest Daughter and Child to <HI>Ralph</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> (of which Family, <HI>Raby</HI> in this Bishoprick was the chief Seat) he had twenty one Chil∣dren in all, but she exceeded her Sisters in honour, being married to <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York;</HI> she was blessed with three Sons, each born in a several Kingdom, <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> (afterward K. <HI>Edward</HI> 4.) born at <HI>Burdeaux</HI> in <HI>France; George</HI> at <HI>Dublin</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> at <HI>Fothe∣ringhay</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> this was her happiness, behold now her Miseries; she saw her Husband killed in Battel, <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> her second Son cruelly murde∣red in a Butt of Malmsey; K. <HI>Edward</HI> her eldest Son cut off by his own intemperance in the prime of his years, his two Sons butchered by their Uncle <HI>Crookbackt Richard,</HI> who himself not long after was slain in the Battel of <HI>Bosworth;</HI> she saw her own reputation publickly murdered at <HI>Pauls Cross</HI> by the procurement of her youngest Son <HI>Richard,</HI> taxing his eldest Brother for Ille∣gitimate,
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>
and a Bastard; and yet our Chronicles do not charge her with haughtiness in her good, nor dejection in her ill Estate, an argument of an even and steddy soul in all alterations; indeed she lived to see <HI>Elizabeth</HI> her Grand-child married to K. <HI>Henry</HI> 7. but little com∣fort acrued to her by that conjunction, the party of the <HI>Yorkists</HI> were so depressed by him; she lived 35 years a Widdow, and died in the 10 of <HI>Hen</HI> 7. 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. and was buried by her Husband in the Collegiate Church of <HI>Fotheringay</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire;</HI> which Quire being de∣molished in King <HI>Henry</HI> 8. time, their bodies lay in the Church-yard without any Monument, till Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> coming thither in Progress, gave order that they should be interred in the Church, and two Tombs erected over them; hereupon their Bodies wrapt in Lead were remo∣ved from their plain Graves, and their Coffins opened; the Dutchess <HI>Cicely</HI> had about her Neck hanging in a Silver Ribbon a Pardon from <HI>Rome,</HI> which penned in a fine <HI>Roman</HI> hand, was as fair and fresh to be read as if it had been written but yesterday; this Lady was a great Benefactress to <HI>Queens Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>In former Ages the Bishops have had the Royalties of Princes over this County, and the Inhabitants have plea∣ded the priviledge not to pass over the River of <HI>Tees</HI> or <HI>Tyne</HI> to serve in War, whose charge as they alledged, was to keep and defend the Corps of St. <HI>Cathbert</HI> their great adored Saint, and therefore they called themselves <HI>The Holy Work Folks,</HI> and the repute of this <HI>Cuthbert</HI> and his supposed defence against the <HI>Scots</HI> was such, that seve∣ral of our <HI>English</HI> Kings went in Devotion to his Tomb on Pilgrimage, and gave large Possessions to his Church; among others, zealous <HI>Canutus,</HI> the greatest of all, came thither bare-footed, and at <HI>Cuthberts</HI> Tomb both inlar∣ged, and confirmed their Liberties. This County is not divided into Hundreds, but Wakes, which are 4, wherein are 118 Parishes, and is in the Diocess of <HI>Dur∣ham;</HI> It elects four Parliament Men, 2 for the County, and 2 for the City of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>

<HI>Richard</HI> 2. the Teeth of a Giant were found (if they were not of an Elephant) of a very great size, and not far thence in the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> more bones as monstruous were digged up. The Monks have recorded that a Pilgrim was sent by St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> to K. <HI>Edward the Confessor</HI> with a Ring, upon which account his house in this County was called <HI>Hav-a-ring;</HI> but the Clergy in those times made no Conscience to invent fictions daily for their own advantage: There were bones digged up at <HI>Ness</HI> near <HI>Harwich</HI> in this County, which with their bigness and length amazed the Beholders. I cannot see, saith Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> how such can maintain them to be the bones of men, who must confess that (according to the Proportion of the Doors and Roofs of ancient Building, which we have either seen or read of) if they were so big and tall, they must go into their Houses stooping, not to say creeping along; except those who affirm it be as careless of their credit as the Traveller was, who affirming he saw Bees as big as Dogs, and yet their Hives were of our ordinary size, and being demanded what shift they made to get in, <HI>Nay,</HI> said he, <HI>what know I, let them look to that.</HI> More probable it is, that these were bones of Elephants, store whereof were brought over into <HI>England</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Claudius.</HI> To these wonders it will not be amiss to adu the ensuing relation, written by Mr, <HI>Tho. Smith</HI> of <HI>Sewarstone</HI> near <HI>Waltham Ab∣by,</HI> a discreet person lately deceased; <HI>Toward the latter end of Q.</HI> Elizabeth, saith he, <HI>I served Sir</HI> Edward Donny, <HI>who lived in the Abby of</HI> Waltham Cross <HI>in</HI> Essex, <HI>which at that time lay in ruinous heaps and Sir</HI> Edward <HI>beginning to re-edifie it, one</HI> Tomkins, <HI>his Gardiner, being employed there∣in, among other things discovered a fair Marble Stone, which was the cover of a Tomb of the same Stone, this cover being re∣moved, there appeared the Anatomy of a man therein, the Bones only remaining in due order, and none of them out of place, and no other dust or filth whatsoever remaining in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Tomb; having well observed it, I told the Spectators, that if they did but touch any part thereof, it would fall in sunder, which being tried happened accordingly; for my part I am per∣suaded

that as the Flesh and Entrails of this Anatomy to us became in visible, so would the bones likewise have been in some longer time.

<P>This County hath no Cathedral, and the Churches therein cannot challenge to themselves any eminent Commendation; but for private houses <HI>Essex</HI> will own no Shire her superiour, whereof Three are most re∣markable. 1. <HI>Audly end</HI> built by the E. of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> which without compare was one of the best Subjects Houses in the Nation; yet is the Structure better than the stand∣ing thereof, as being somewhat low on the one side. 2. <HI>Newhall,</HI> built by the <HI>Ratcliffs,</HI> Earls of <HI>Sussex,</HI> which is extream pleasant for the shady approach thereunto, and for the Parks round about it. 3. <HI>Copthal</HI> highly seat∣ed on an hill in the midst of a Park, built by the Ab∣bot of <HI>Waltham,</HI> enlarged by Sir <HI>Thomas Heneage,</HI> and others; herein is a Gallery as well furnished, and more proportionable than any in <HI>England.</HI> In <HI>November</HI> 1639. there happened an <HI>Hurricano,</HI> or Whirl-wind, which entring in at the great East Window, blew that down, and carried some part thereof, with the Picture of the L. <HI>Coventry</HI> (singled from many more which hung on both sides untouched) all the length of the Gallery, being about 56 Yards, out of the West Window, which it threw down to the ground; some observed the like Wind in other places about the same time, as ominous and presaging our civil Dissentions.</P>
<P>There is a Proverb in this County, <HI>He may fetch a Flitch of Bacon from</HI> Dunmow: This Proverb dependeth on a custom practised in the Priory of <HI>Dunmow,</HI> which was founded by <HI>Juga</HI> a noble Lady, for black Nuns 1111. But it seems the property of it was after altered into a Male-Nunnery, the Friars whereof were sometimes, it appears, very merry: for they ordained, <HI>That if any person from any part of</HI> England <HI>would come thither, and hum∣bly
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>
kneel on two stones, yet to be seen, at the Church door be∣fore the Convent, and solemnly take the ensuing Oath, he might demand a Gamon or Flitch of Bacon, which should be freely gi∣ven him.</HI></P>
<Q><L>You shall swear by the custom of our Confession,</L>
<L>That you never made any nuptial Transgression</L>
<L>Since you were married Man and Wife,</L>
<L>By houshold Brawls, or contentious Strife,</L>
<L>Or otherwise in Bed, or at Board,</L>
<L>Offended each other in deed or Word,</L>
<L>Or since the Parish Clerk said <HI>Amen</HI></L>
<L>Wished your selves unmarried agen,</L>
<L>Or in a Twelve Month and a day</L>
<L>Repented not in thought any way,</L>

<L>As when you join'd hands in Holy-Quire;</L>
<L>If to these conditions without all fear</L>
<L>Of your own accord you will freely swear,</L>
<L>A Gamon of Bacon you shalt receive,</L>

<P>It appeareth in an old book on Record, that <HI>Richard Wright</HI> of <HI>Badesworth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk</HI> in the 23. of <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 6. when <HI>John Canon</HI> was Prior; and that <HI>Stephen Samuel</HI> of <HI>Little Easton</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> the 7th of <HI>Edward</HI> 4. and <HI>Thomas Lee</HI> of <HI>Coxhall</HI> in <HI>Essex</HI> the 2. of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. took the afore∣said Oath, demanded their Bacon on the premises, and received it accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Randolph Peveril</HI> of <HI>Hatfield-Peveril</HI> in this County, was in great esteem with K. <HI>Edward the Confessor,</HI> who was very bountiful to him, as having married the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Inglerick</HI> his Kinsman, who was of great Nobility among the <HI>English</HI> Saxons; this Lady was of such ad∣mirable beauty, that she therewith conquered <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> who desired nothing more than to be a Prisoner in her Arms, to obtain which, he inriched St. <HI>Martins Le Grand</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> first founded by her Father,
<PB N="69" REF="38"/>
and her Uncle K. <HI>Edward;</HI> he then preferred her two Brothers, <HI>William Peveril</HI> to be Keeper of <HI>Dover Castle,</HI> and <HI>Pain Peveril</HI> he made Baron of <HI>Bourn</HI> in <HI>Cambridg∣shire;</HI> having thus preferred her Kindred, he began to sollicite her by the Messengers of the Devils Bed-Cham∣ber, that is, subtil insinuating Pimps, and Bawds, and sometimes he himself visited her (like <HI>Jupiter</HI>) in a golden shower, by these forceable demonstrations of love, and unavoidable allurements (especially from a King) she was at length brought to his unlawful Bed, unto whom she bore a Son, named <HI>William,</HI> who was Lord of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> but his Mother being afterward touched with remorse of Conscience, to expiate her guilt, was taught by the Doctrine of those times to found a Colledge in the Village of <HI>Harpsfield,</HI> which she con∣secrated to the honour of God, and St. <HI>Mary Magdalen;</HI> wherein setting apart all worldly affairs, she spent the remainder of her days, and died about the year 1100.</P>
<P>In the 17th of <HI>Henry</HI> 2. there was seen at St. <HI>Osythes</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> a Dragon of wonderful bigness, which wherever it moved, burnt the Houses and places about it. In the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. the King commanded <HI>Hubert de Burg,</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> to be apprehended; who having notice thereof, rose at midnight, and fled into a Church in <HI>Essex;</HI> the Officers found him upon his knees before the High Altar, with the Popish Sacrament in one hand, and a Cross in the other, however they seized him, and car∣ried him away Prisoner to the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London; Roger Niger,</HI> then Bishop, made great complaint to the King, of this violence, and wrong done to Holy Church, and would not be satisfied till the Earl was carried back to the same Church again, though well guarded there; however this it is thought saved the Earls life, for the Kings anger cooled, and he was soon after reconciled to him. In the year 1510. in the Marshes of <HI>Dengey</HI> Hundred near <HI>South-Minster</HI> in this County there sudden∣ly appeared an infinite number of Mice, which over∣run those Marshes, tearing up the Grass by the roots, and so poysoned it with their venemous Teeth, that the
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>
Cattle which grazed thereon died, but at length a great number of strange painted Owls came, no man knew whence, and devoured all the Mice; it is reported that there happened the like in <HI>Essex</HI> in 1648.</P>
<P>There were no less than forty four Persons who suffe∣red Martyrdom for the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion in this Coun∣ty; among whom was <HI>William Hunter</HI> a young man of 19 years old, born of religious Parents, who instructed him in the Truth, and sent him to be an Apprentice in <HI>London,</HI> where refusing to go to Mass, and receive the Sacrament, he went home to his Parents at <HI>Burntwood,</HI> and one day going into a Chappel there, he found a Bi∣ble, which while he was reading, a Summoner came in, and asked him whether he could expound the Scrip∣ture, he answered, <HI>He did only read it to his Comfort;</HI> the Sumner replied, <HI>It was never a merry world since the Bible came forth in</HI> English; <HI>Hunter</HI> answered, <HI>Say not so for Gods sake, for it is Gods Book, out of which every one ought to learn how to please God, and therefore I pray God that we may have the Blessed Bible amongst us; Ay</HI> said the Sumner, <HI>I know your mind well enough, you are one of those that do not like the Queens Laws; but you and many more must turn over a new leaf, or you will broil for it; pray God give me grace,</HI> said <HI>Hunter, that I may believe his word, and confess his name whatever comes of it; Nay,</HI> said the Sumner, <HI>you confess the Devils name, and will all go to him;</HI> The Sumner then fetcht a Priest out of a blind Alehouse, who finding <HI>Hunter</HI> reading, reviled him for it, and then asked him what he thought of the blessed Sacrament of the Altar, whether there were not really Christs Body and Blood; <HI>Hunter</HI> said, <HI>He found no such thing in Scripture; ah,</HI> quoth the Vicar, <HI>now I find you are an Heretick; Hunter</HI> replyed, <HI>Would you and I were both tyed to a Stake to try whether of us would stick closest to our Faith;</HI> The Priest left him, and informing against him, he was seized and brought be∣fore Bishop <HI>Bonner,</HI> who finding that he stood firm to his Principles, caused his Officers to set him in the Stocks, in his <HI>Gate-house,</HI> where he lay 2 days, and had nothing but a crust of brown bread, and a cup of cold water;
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>
after Imprisonment three quarters of a Year, the Bp. condemned him, and sent him to <HI>Burntwood</HI> to be burnt; where his Father and Mother came to him, <HI>be∣seeching God he might continue constant to the end:</HI> His Mo∣ther added, <HI>she was happy in bearing such a Child, who could find in his heart to lose his Life for Christ's sake.</HI> At the stake he kneeled down, and read the 51st Psalm; then the Sheriff said to him, <HI>Here is a Letter from the Queen, if thou wilt recant thou shalt live, otherwise thou shalt be burnt: No,</HI> quoth <HI>William, I will never recant,</HI> and so he was fasten∣ed to the stake: He then said, <HI>Good People, pray for me while you see me alive,</HI> adding, <HI>Son of God shine upon me:</HI> and the Sun immediately shone out of a thick Cloud so full in his face, that he was forced to turn his head aside; fire being kindled he lift up his Hand to Heaven saying <HI>Lord, Lord, receive my Spirit,</HI> and so ended his Life in the Flames.</P>
<P><HI>John Lawrence</HI> was burnt at <HI>Colchester,</HI> whose Legs be∣ing lame with Irons, and his Body weak with cruel u∣sage, he was carried to the Stake in a Chair, and burnt therein; at his burning many young Children being a∣bout the fire, cried out to him, <HI>Lord strengthen thy ser∣vant, and keep thy Promise,</HI> which was lookt on as a pro∣duct of Divine Providence, who <HI>out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings hath ordained strength. Thomas Hawks</HI> Gentleman was first brought into trouble for refusing to baptise his Child after the <HI>Popish</HI> fashion: This man go∣ing to the stake, promised his Friends to give them some solemn Token of the clearness and comfort of his Conscience; in performance whereof, whilst his Body was burning, he raised up himself, and though having the sense, yet having no fear of the Fire, joyfully clap∣ped his hands over his head, to the Admiration of all the Beholders. There was an Idol called the Rood of <HI>Dover-Court</HI> in this County, to which multitudes of Peo∣ple went in Pilgrimage: Divers zealous Protestants at <HI>Dedham</HI> being much troubled to see the Almighty so dis∣honoured by wicked Idolatry, went from thence in a Frosty Moonshine Night 10 Miles to the place where
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>
the Idol was, where they found the Church Doors open, the <HI>Popish</HI> Clergy boasting the power of this Rood was such, that no man could shut the doors of the Church where it stood: These Persons taking the Image from the place where it stood, carried it a quarter of a Mile off, and there burnt it to ashes; for which three of them were by the bloody Papists hanged in Chains. In 1605. a great <HI>Porpus</HI> was taken at <HI>Westham</HI> in a little Creek alive, a Mile and half within the Land, and with∣in a few days after a Whale came up the <HI>Thames,</HI> whose lenght was seen divers times above Water, and judged to exceed the largest Ship in the River; but when she tasted the Fresh-Water, and scented the Land, she returned into the Sea.</P>
<P>This County contains 20 Hundreds, 21 Market Towns, and 415 Parish Churches: It is in the Diocess of <HI>London,</HI> and elects 8 Parliament men; for the County 2. <HI>Col∣chester</HI> 2. <HI>Harwich</HI> 2. <HI>Malden</HI> 2. and gives the Title of Earl to <HI>Arthur</HI> L. <HI>Capel.</HI></P>
<P>GLOCESTERSHIRE hath <HI>Worcester</HI> and <HI>Warwickshire</HI> on the North, <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Wiltshire</HI> on the East, <HI>Somersetshire</HI> on the South, <HI>Herefordshire</HI> with the River <HI>Wye</HI> on the West; the River <HI>Severn</HI> runs through it, and <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> the old Historian thus describes it: <HI>The ground of this Shire throughout,</HI> saith he, <HI>yieldeth plenty of Corn, and bringeth forth abundance of Fruits, the one only through the natural goodness of the ground, the other by diligent manuring and tillage, insomuch that it would provoke the most lazy Person to take pains; Here you may see the High ways and common Lanes full of Apple-trees and Peer-trees, not in∣grafted by the industry of Mans hand, but growing naturally of their own accord, the ground itself is so inclined to bear fruit, and those both in taste and beauty far exceeding others, and will endure till a new supply come; There is not any Coun∣ty in</HI> England <HI>so thick set with Vineyards as this is, so plen∣tiful of increase, and so pleasant in taste, the very Wines made thereof have no ill taste, and are little inferiour to the</HI> French; <HI>the Houses are innumerable, the Churches very fair, and the

Towns standing very thick, but that which addeth a greater glory to it, is the River</HI> Severn, <HI>than which there is not any in the Kingdom exceeds it for breadth of Channel, swiftness of stream, or for Fish better stored: There is in it a daily rage and fury of the Waters, which I know not whether to call a Gulf, or Whirlpool of Waves, raising up Sands from the bottom, winding and driving them upon heaps, and sometimes overflow∣ing its banks, roveth a great way on the bordering grounds, and then returneth again into its usual Channel; unhappy is the Vessel, which it taketh full upon the side, but the Watermen be∣ing aware of it, when they see it coming turn their Vessels, and cut through the midst of it, and thereby avoid the danger.</HI> Thus far he.</P>
<P>This encounter of the salt, and fresh water (as is supposed) here mentioned, is called in this Country the <HI>Higre,</HI> and by some the <HI>Eagre,</HI> for the keenness and fierceness thereof, which is such, that it is equally terri∣ble with the flashings, and noise, to those that see and hear it, much more to them who feel it; of which there can be no reason rendered, since the <HI>Thames</HI> where we find the same cause, hath no such disturbance.

<L>Shut up in narrower bounds, the <HI>Higre</HI> wildly raves,</L>
<L>And frights the stragling Flocks the Neighbouring shores o flie,</L>
<L>Afar as from the Main it comes with hideous cry;</L>
<L>And on the angry front the curled foam doth bring,</L>
<L>The Billows 'gainst the Banks when fiercely it doth fling;</L>
<L>Throws up the slimy Ouze, and makes the scaly brood,</L>

<P>We read that in the 2. of King <HI>Richard</HI> 3. at that time when the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> intended to pass with his Army over the <HI>Severn</HI> there was so great an Inundation of Water that men were drowned in their Beds, Houses were overturned, Children were carried a∣bout the Fields swimming in their Cradles; and Beasts
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
drowned even upon the Hills, which rage of the Wa∣ters continued for the space of 10 days, and is called to this day in those parts, <HI>The Great Water.</HI> In the 17 of Q. <HI>Elizabeth, Feb.</HI> 24. being a hard frost, after a flood which was not great, there came down the River of <HI>Severn</HI> such a swarm of Flies, and Beetles that they were judged to be above an 100 Quarters; the Mills therea∣bout were dammed up with them for the space of 4 days, and then were cleansed by digging them out with Shovels. In 1607. a mighty West-wind which conti∣nued 16 hours, brought the Sea into the <HI>Severn</HI> (after a great rain, and at a spring Tyde) with such violence, that the River began to overflow its banks from as far as the Mount in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> along on both sides up into <HI>So∣mersetshire, and Glocestershire;</HI> in some places the waters rose three foot, in others 5, and 7, and in some Towns and Villages they rose higher than the tops of the Hou∣ses, so that notwithstanding whatever course could be taken, there were 80 Persons drowned, besides much Cattle, divers Churches, and several Parishes overwhel∣med thereby; it did likewise a great deal of harm in <HI>Wales,</HI> the damages being reckoned above 20 thousand pound.</P>
<P>In the year 755 <HI>Kenwulf</HI> King of the <HI>West Saxons,</HI> gi∣ving himself up to all manner of Vice, and Debauchery, coming to <HI>Merton</HI> in this County to visit a Wench that he kept, was there slain, and buried at <HI>Winchester.</HI> About the year 1020. <HI>Godwin</HI> the subtle Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> cast a covetous eye on the fair Nunnery of <HI>Berkly</HI> in <HI>Glocester∣shire,</HI> and thus contrived it for himself; he left there a handsome young man as seemingly sick, for their Chari∣ty to recover, the Abbess was a fair and noble Lady, <HI>Godwin</HI> seeking not her but hers, gives the young man charge so long to counterfeit, till he had debauched the Abbess, and as many of the Nuns besides as he could intice to his pleasure, and left him withal Rings, Jewels, Girdles, and such toys to give them still when they came to visit him; the young man willing to undergo such a task, so plaid his part, that in a short time he got up
<PB N="75" REF="41"/>
most of their Bellies, and when he had done, told his Lord how he had sped; the Earl goes instantly to Court, tells the King that such a Nunnery was become a Bawdy House, procures a Visitation, gets them turned out, and begs the Land for his own use. At another time this <HI>Godwin</HI> had a mind to another rich Mannor in <HI>Sussex,</HI> called <HI>Boscham,</HI> and complemented it out of <HI>Ro∣bert</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in this manner; coming to the Archbishop, he said, <HI>Da mihi Basium,</HI> that is, <HI>Give me a buss or kiss,</HI> an usual favour from such a Prelate; the Archbishop answers, <HI>Do tibi Basium, I give thee a kiss,</HI> and therewith kissed him; upon which <HI>Godwin</HI> presently goes to <HI>Bascham,</HI> and takes possession thereof, and though here was neither any real intention in him that passed it away, nor valuable consideration to him, but a meer circumvention, yet such was <HI>Godwins</HI> power, and the Archbishops poorness of Spirit, that he quietly enjoyed it; these rich and ancient Mannors of <HI>Berkly and Boscham,</HI> though distant ten miles asunder, are both now met in the Right Honourable <HI>George</HI> Earl of <HI>Berkly,</HI> as Heir Ap∣parent thereof, his Ancestors being long since possessed of them.</P>
<P>In the Reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 1. the Monastery of <HI>Glo∣cester</HI> was burnt down to the ground. In King <HI>Henry</HI> 8. time, <HI>James Bainham</HI> Son to Sir <HI>Alexander Bainham</HI> of this County, was burnt for professing the Gospel; he was bred in Learning, and had knowledge of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues, of a virtuous disposition, and Religious Conversation, much addicted to Prayer, and a diligent Reader of the Holy Scriptures; he applied himself to the study of the Law, wherein he was very merciful to his Clients, ready to give Council to Widdows, Fa∣therless and Afflicted without mony or reward; at last he was suspected, and complained of to Sir <HI>Tho. More,</HI> then Lord Chancellor, and being brought to his House at <HI>Chelsey,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> laboured with frowns and flatteries to withdraw him from the truth, which not prevailing; he caused him to be tied to a Tree in his Garden (cal∣led by him the <HI>The Tree of Truth</HI>) and then most cruelly
<PB N="76" REF="42"/>
scourged him to make him renounce his opinion; this not succeeding, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> himself saw him cruelly racked in the <HI>Tower,</HI> till he was lamed, because he would not accuse some of his acquaintance, nor discover where his Books lay; then was his Wife Imprisoned, and his Goods confiscated, yet at last he was persuaded to abjure, and solemnly carried a Torch and a Faggot in St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church; but hereby he rather exchanged than escaped fire, feeling such a fire in his own Consci∣ence that he could not be quiet till he had asked God, and all the world forgiveness, which he did 1st in the Pro∣testant Congregation who met privately in a Ware-house in <HI>Bow-lane;</HI> the next Lords day he went to St. <HI>Austins,</HI> the next Parish Church to St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> that the Antidote might be brought as near as he could conveniently to the place of his poyson, where standing up in a Pew with an <HI>English</HI> New Testament in his hand, he declared o∣penly before all the People with abundance of Tears, <HI>That he had denied God, and prayed all the Congregation to believe him, and to be warned by his fall not to do the like; for,</HI> said he, <HI>if I should not return again to the Truth, this Word of God,</HI> (holding up his New Testament) <HI>would damn me both body and soul in the day of Judgement,</HI> and therefore he intreated them all, <HI>rather to dye presently, than to do as he had done, for he would not feel such an hell in his Conscience again for all the World;</HI> After this he was soon apprehended a∣gain, and cruelly handled by the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> put∣ting him in the Stocks, and whipping him barbarously for a fortnight together, to force him again to recant, but all in vain, so that he was condemned to be burnt; and being in the midst of the Flames which had half consumed his Arms and Legs, he spake these words; <HI>O ye</HI> Papists, <HI>behold you look for Miracles, and here now you may see a Miracle, for in this Fire I feel no more pain than if I were in a bed of Down, but it is to me as a bed of Roses.</HI> There was in this County one <HI>William Dangerfield,</HI> who (with his Wife) was imprisoned for the Protestant Faith, and was so cruelly used by the Bishop, that his legs were al∣most eaten off with the Irons; after a while the Bishop
<PB N="77" REF="42"/>
sent for him, and told him his Wife had recanted, who was as well learned as he, and therefore persuaded him to sign a Recantation which they brought; having signed it, they let him go to his Wife, and shewing his Recan∣tation, her heart was ready to break, crying out, <HI>Alas Husband, thus long we have continued one, and hath Sa∣tan now so far prevailed with you, as to cause you to break your Vow which you made to God in Baptism.</HI> This so far prevai∣led with him, that he repented of his Apostacy, and not long after through the extream cruelty used to them, they both dyed in Prison. In 1575. <HI>Feb.</HI> 16. between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, great Earthquakes happened in <HI>Glocester, Worcester, Hereford, York, Bristow,</HI> and the parts adjacent, which caused the People to run out of their Houses for fear they should have fallen on their heads; in <HI>Tewksbury, Bredon,</HI> and other places, the dishes fell off the shelves, and books in mens studies fell down before them; in <HI>Norton</HI> Chappel the People being at Prayers, and feeling the ground move, ran out for fear it should have fallen on their heads; part of <HI>Rithing Castle</HI> fell down, and likewise divers brick Chimnies in several Gentlemens Houses. In the year 1650. <HI>Nov.</HI> 30. being St. <HI>Andrews</HI> day, about Sun-rising, the Sky opened in a dreadful manner in the South west, over <HI>Standish,</HI> a Town 5 miles from <HI>Glocester,</HI> and there appeared a ter∣rible fiery Sword shaking, with the Hilt upward to∣ward the Heavens, and the point downward to the Earth; the Hilt seemed to be blew, the Sword of a great length moving to and fro, and coming lower to∣ward the Earth, there was a long flame of fire toward the point sparkling, and flaming in a fearful manner to the great astonishment of the Spectators, who were ma∣ny; at last the Heavens closing, the Sword vanished, and the fire fell to the Earth, and ran upon the ground; <HI>this,</HI> saith Mr. <HI>Clark, I had from an Eye-witness.</HI></P>

<HI>whispering</HI> place within, which is thus described by Sir <HI>Francis Bacon; There is a Church at</HI> Glocester, saith he, <HI>(and as I have heard, the like is in some other Places) where if you speak against a Wall softly, another shall hear your voice bet∣ter a great way off than near at hand, I suppose there is so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vault or Hollow, or Isle behind the wall, and some passage to it toward the further end of that wall against which you speak so as the voice of him that speaketh, slideth along the wall, and then entreth at some passage, and communicateth with the air of the hollow; for it is somewhat preserved by the plain wall, but that is too weak to give an audible sound, till it hath communi∣cated with the back air.</HI></P>
<P>In this Church lies the unfortunate <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> eldest Son to <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, in a pain∣ted wooden Tomb in the midst of the Quire, whose Eyes were pluckt out in <HI>Cardiff</HI> Castle, wherein he was kept Prisoner 26 years. Here also the unhappy King <HI>Edward</HI> 2. lies buried, under a Monument of Alabast∣er, who in the 20 year of his Reign was deposed by Parliament; who sitting at <HI>London,</HI> sent several Bishops, Lords, and Gentlemen in the name of the body of the State (if that may be called a body, which then had no head there) to <HI>Kenelworth</HI> Castle to the King, to whom one of the Commissioners represented, <HI>That the Commonweal had received such irreconcilable dislikes of his Government, the pa ticulars whereof had been opened in the General Assembly at</HI> London, <HI>that they were resolved never to endure he should be King any longer; that notwithstanding these dislikes had not extended themselves so far as for his sake to exclude his issue, but that with universal Applause and Joy, the Commonweal had in Parliament Elected his eldest Son the Lord</HI> Edward <HI>for King, that it would be a very acceptable thing to God if he did willingly give over an Earthly King∣dom for the common good and quiet of his Country, which they said could not otherwise be secured; that yet his honour would be never the less after his Resignation than it was before; only the Commonweal would never suffer him to Reign any longer, and finally they presumed to tell him, That unless he did freely of himself renounce his Crown and Scepter, the People would nei∣ther

<P>Out of the ruines of this City rose the fair Town of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> remarkable for bringing forth <HI>Alban</HI> the Mar∣tyr; for about the year of Christ 180. King <HI>Lucius</HI> reigned in <HI>Brittain,</HI> who hearing of the Miracles and Wonders done by the Christians in divers places, sent Letters to <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> desiring to re∣ceive the Christian Faith; the good Bishop being glad of this request, sent him two Preachers, <HI>Faganus</HI> and <HI>Damianus,</HI> by whose faithful endeavours, it pleased God, the King and many of his People were Converted, and Baptized, the Temples of Idols, and other Monuments of Gentilism were subverted; thus the true Religion increased, and Superstition and Idolatry decreased, ma∣ny Bishops being ordained, and set over the People, and all things setled in good order; after which this religi∣ous King sent again to <HI>Eleutherius</HI> for the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, according to which he desired to govern his People; to which request <HI>Eleutherius</HI> returned this answer, <HI>That for the</HI> Roman <HI>and</HI> Imperial <HI>Laws, they might have their defects, but the Law of God could not;</HI> and thereupon advi∣sed

The Christian Faith thus received by the <HI>Brittains,</HI> flourished here 216 years, till the coming of the <HI>Saxons;</HI> But the <HI>Ramans</HI> continuing Heathens, raised much trouble a∣gainst the Professors thereof, especially after the death of <HI>Lucius,</HI> who dying without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Barons and No∣bles disagreeing about a Successor, the <HI>Romans</HI> stepped in, and took the Crown into their hands, whereupon great ruine and misery ensued to the Kingdom; for sometimes the Idolatrous <HI>Romans</HI> reigned, and some∣times the Christian <HI>Brittains,</HI> according to the fortune of the War; The first remarkable Persecution which we hear of, was under <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> and <HI>Maximi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> when the Heathens raged so extreamly, that in <HI>Brittany,</HI> and some other Places, there are reckoned Seventeen Thousand Martyrs who suffered for the name of Christ; In this Persecution a famous Preacher called <HI>Amphibolus</HI> being searcht for to be Imprisoned, he to escape the fury of his Persecutors, hid himself in the House of <HI>Alban</HI> aforemen∣tioned, who was a Citizen of <HI>Verulam,</HI> now St. <HI>Albans;</HI> this <HI>Alban</HI> was at that time a Heathen, but observing <HI>Amphibolus</HI> to continue day and night in watching and Prayer, he began to be convinced, and to hearken to the Divine Instructions and Exhortations of this good man, and forsaking Idolatry, he became a very sincere Christian; The Enemy having intelligence that this Minister was in his house, Soldiers were ordered to search for him, which <HI>Alban</HI> having notice of, he apparel∣led himself in the cloths of <HI>Amphibolus,</HI> and offered him∣self to the Souldiers, who bound him, and carried him before the Judge, who was at that time sacrificing to his Idols; The Judge perceiving the business, said, <HI>Since thou hadst rather convey away the Rebel and Traytor to our

Gods, than deliver him up to undergo due punishment for his blaspheming our Deities, look therefore what Torments he should have suffered if he had been taken, the same shalt thou endure if thou refuse to practise the Rights of our Religion; Alban</HI> was regardless of these Threats, and being replenished with Divine Fortitude, boldly told the Judge to his face, <HI>That he would not obey his Commandment,</HI> Then said the Judge, <HI>Of what House and Stock art thou? Alban</HI> an∣swered, <HI>It is no matter of what stock I am, but if thou desirest to know my Religion, be it known unto thee that I am a Christi∣an, and that I imploy my self in the exercise of their Holy Re∣ligion;</HI> The Judge then demanded his name; <HI>my Parents,</HI> said he, <HI>named me</HI> Alban, <HI>And I Honour and Worship the True living God who made all things of nothing.</HI> The Judge being inraged hereat, said, <HI>If thou desirest to prolong thy life, come and Sacrifice to our Gods; Alban</HI> answered, <HI>The Sa∣crifice you offer to the Devil profits you nothing, but rather pur∣chaseth for you eternal pains in Hell-fire;</HI> The Judge was still more incensed hereat, and commanded the tormentors to beat him, thinking stripes might prevail more than words; yet <HI>Alban</HI> continued not only patient, but joy∣ful in the midst of all his Torments, the Judge percei∣ving that neither words nor blows would remove him from his Constancy, commanded him to be beheaded; The Executioner observing his fervent Faith and Pray∣ers, fell down at his Feet, throwing away the Sword, desiring rather to die for him or with him, than to do Execution upon him, and suffered accordingly, whereby he was made a Martyr for that Faith, of which he was before a Persecutor; The other Officers were astoni∣shed and trembled to behold this strange Providence, but at last one of them took up the Sword, wherewith he cut off the Martyr <HI>Albans</HI> head.</P>

banished his Realm; being put into a boat without Sail or Tackle, and arriving upon the Coasts of <HI>England</HI> was relieved by <HI>Offa,</HI> who was then a young Nobleman, and changed her name to <HI>Quenrid,</HI> of whom he became so much in love, that contrary to the Will of his Pa∣rents he married her; she being of a proud, cruel, and ambitious Nature, as appears by the sequel; For <HI>E∣thelbert</HI> King of the East Angles, a wise and religious Prince, coming to the Court of King <HI>Offa,</HI> being per∣suaded by his Nobles to desire his Daughter in Marri∣age, was accompanied with a great Train suitable to his Quality; but Queen <HI>Quenrid,</HI> envious of his grandeur, persuaded her Husband, that he came thither upon some treacherous design, and therefore he with some of his Council, contrived his destruction, which some say was by causing him to fall into a deep Pit, digged to that purpose under his Chair of State, and that then be∣ing alone, one <HI>Gimbert</HI> took and bound him, and then struck off his Head, which he presented to the King and Queen: Thus was this Innocent Prince unjustly mur∣dered, but not without divine Vengeance following the Actors; for the Queen, Author of this Villany, died in three months after, and was so tormented in her sick∣ness, that she bit and tore her Tongue in pieces, which had been the Instrument of this Barbarity, and <HI>Offa</HI> at length being satisfied of the Kings Innocence, and the heinousness of the Fact, gave the 10th part of his Goods to the Church, and according to the De∣votion of that Age, built the Abby of St. <HI>Albans</HI> and other Monasteries, and went afterward to do Pennance at <HI>Rome,</HI> where he gave to the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> a Penny from every House in his Dominions, which were commonly called <HI>Romeshot,</HI> or <HI>Peter-Pence,</HI> and at last was transformed from a King to a Monk: Thus the Almighty punished not only him and his Wife, but the whole Land suffered for this horrid Murder, in being made the Popes Vassals, for the Clergy seldom parting with any thing they get, the poor <HI>English</HI> were forced to pay this unjust Tax for many Hundred Years

<P>In the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> 3. the Abbot of St. <HI>Albans</HI> ordered his Servant to fetch him a mans Wife in the Town, with whom he pretended earnest business; the Servant accordingly brought her to his Masters Cham∣ber, and then withdrawing, the Abbot told her, that her Cloaths were but very mean, but if she would be ruled by him, she should wear as good Cloaths as any Woman in the Parish, and therewith began to be very brisk upon her; and finding persuasions would not pre∣vail, endeavoured by force to debauch her, but all in vain, whereupon he kept her several days a Prisoner in his Chamber, which her Husband having notice of, fetches her from him, and tells his Neighbours he will sue the Abbot for imprisoning his Wife; which he hear∣ing of, prosecuted the poor man in the Ecclesiastical Court for defamation, and thereby frighted him from any further proceedings. Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> (though a vi∣rulent Papist) reports a story of the like Nature, That a poor man found a Priest over familiar with his Wife, and because he told it abroad, and had no Witnesses to prove it, the Priest sued him in the Bishops Court, and at length the Poor man under pain of being cursed and excommunicated, was enjoined to stand up in the Church the next <HI>Sunday,</HI> and say, <HI>Mouth thou lyest;</HI> ac∣cordingly having repeated what he had reported of the Priest, he put his hand to his Mouth, and said, <HI>Mouth thou liest,</HI> and then laying his hands on his Eyes, he said, <HI>But Eyes, by the Mass, ye lye not a whit.</HI> In K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 7. time an Act was made to punish the incontinency of Priests, and <HI>Francis Petrarch</HI> an Archdeacon thus Anato∣mizes the <HI>Roman</HI> Clergy, which discovers the extream Chastity of the Popish Batchelors.</P>

this Hill with a Rock under it, made at first a mighty bellowing noise, which was heard a great way off, and then lifted up itself a great height, and began to travel, carrying along with it the Trees which grew upon it, the Sheepfolds, and flocks of Sheep abiding thereon at the same time; in the place from whence it first moved, it left a gaping distance 40 Foot wide, and 80 Ells long, the whole field was about Twenty Acres; passing along it overthrew a Chappel standing in its way, removed an Ewe-tree growing in the Church-Yard from the West to the East; with the like violence it thrust before it Highways, Houses, and Trees, it made <HI>tilled</HI> ground <HI>pasture,</HI> and again turned <HI>pasture</HI> into <HI>Tillage;</HI> having thus walked from <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Evening, till <HI>Monday</HI> Noon, it then stood still, and moved no more, mounting to a Hill 12 Fathoms high.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>William the Conqueror, Walter</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hereford</HI> attempted to force the Chastity of a Woman who was a Semstress, whom out of pretence of work∣ing for him he brought into his Chamber, but she refu∣sing to consent, wounded him in the Belly with a pair of Scissars, whereof he died. In 1233. a little before the Wars broke forth between K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. and his Barons, there appeared at <HI>Hereford</HI> five Suns at once, and a cer∣tain great Circle of a Christal colour about two Foot in breadth, as it were compassing all <HI>England.</HI> In the Reign of King <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. 1402. <HI>Owen Glendour</HI> being by the <HI>Welch</HI> made their King and Captain, having got together a considerable number, brake into the borders of <HI>Here∣fordshire,</HI> making spoil and Prey of the Country, as free∣ly as if they had leave to do it, and indeed they had none to oppose them, but only the Lord <HI>Edmund Morti∣mer,</HI> who was at his Castle of <HI>Wigmore,</HI> he assembling the Country Forces, and joining Battle with them was over∣thrown by them, himself being taken Prisoner, and then fettered, and cast into a deep and vile Dungeon, from whence King <HI>Henry</HI> would not be persuaded to de∣liver him, but could rather have wished both him and his two Sisters in Heaven, they being all three Competi∣tors

for the Crown with him, It was thought, if <HI>Owen Glendour</HI> had as well known how to use the Victory, as to get it, he might at this time have gone far in freeing the <HI>Welch</HI> from the <HI>English</HI> Yoak, but having killed a Thou∣sand of the <HI>English,</HI> he thought he had done enough for that time, and so giving over the pursuit, retired; The Inhumanity of the <HI>Welch</HI> Women was here memorable, who fell upon the dead Carkases of the <HI>English,</HI> first stripping, and then cutting off their Privy Members, and Noses, whereof the first they thrust into their Mouths, and the other they pressed between their Buttocks.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Oldcastle</HI> L. <HI>Cobham</HI> was born in this County, a valiant man, and a great Follower of <HI>Wickliff,</HI> for which he lost his life; for this worthy Lord imbracing his Doctrines, and being a zealous defender both of them and the Professors thereof, he thereby exposed himself to the utmost fury and malice of his <HI>Popish</HI> adversaries, and thereupon <HI>Arundel</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> called a Synod of the Clergy, who charged him with 246 Articles of Heresy, and then made grievous complaints of him to K. <HI>Henry</HI> 5. who having patiently heard these blood-thirsty Wolves, desired them that because he was of Noble Blood, and was <HI>his Knight,</HI> they would endea∣vour to reduce him with gentleness, rather than rigor, promising also that himself would seriously discourse with him concerning these matters; and accordingly sent for the L. <HI>Cobham,</HI> advising him as an obedient Child to submit himself to the Church, and acknow∣ledge his fault; To whom this Christian Knight answe∣red, <HI>Most worthy Prince, I am always ready and willing to obey you, whom I know to be the Minister of God, bearing the Sword for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of those that do well; unto you next to my eternal God, I owe all obedience, and submit all I have to you, being ready to obey at all times whatever you shall in the Lord command me, but as for the Pope and his Spiritualty, I owe them neither sute nor service, knowing him by the Scriptures to be the Great Antichrist, the Son of Perdition, the open Enemy to God, and the Abomination standing in the Holy place;</HI> When the King heard this

stout answer; he left him to the Bishops, not daring in∣deed to do otherwise, the Princes of that Age being miserably Priest-ridden and Inslaved by the Pope and his Clergy; Then the Archbishop proceeded further a∣gainst him, persuading him to recant what he had writ∣ten, or else threatning to condemn him as an Heretick; the L. <HI>Cobham</HI> answered, <HI>Do as you think best, for I am at a point, that which I have written I will stand to, to the death;</HI> Soon after the Archbishop came again, telling him he was ready to absol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him if he humbly desired it, <HI>No,</HI> said the Lord <HI>Cobham, I will not, for I never yet trespassed a∣gainst you,</HI> and so kneeling down, and lifting up his Eyes and Hands toward Heaven, he said; <HI>I humbly confess my sins unto thee O Eternal, and everliving God; In my frail youth I offended thee O Lord, by Pride, Covetousness, Wrath, and Ʋncleanness, many men have I hurt in mine anger, and have committed many other horrible sins, for which good Lord I ask thee forgiveness;</HI> And then weeping, he stood up and said, <HI>Lo good People for breaking Gods Laws, and his Holy Commandments, the Prelates never yet cursed me; but for their own Laws and Traditions they handle me most cruelly, and therefore they and their Laws shall according to Gods promise be utterly destroyed.</HI> After this they proceeded to read the Sentence of Condemnation against him, to whom the L. <HI>Cobham</HI> with a cheerful countenance said, <HI>Though you judge my body which is but a wretched thing, yet I am sure you can do no more harm to my Soul than Satan could to</HI> Jobs, <HI>for he that created it will, I doubt not, of his infinite mercy save it, and as for the Confession of my Faith, I will stand to it even to the very death, by the Grace of my eternal God;</HI> And then turning to the People, he spake thus to them with a loud voice; <HI>Good People for Gods sake be well aware of these men, or else they will beguile you, and lead you blindfold into Hell with themselves,</HI> and so falling down upon his knees, he prayed for his Enemies, saying, <HI>Lord God Eternal, I beseech thee of thine infinite mercy to forgive my Persecutors, if it be thy blessed will,</HI> and so he was sent back to the <HI>Tower,</HI> from whence he soon after escaped into <HI>Wales,</HI> where he lay concealed four years, though a great sum of money was offered to

bring him in alive or dead; But at last the Lord <HI>Powis,</HI> either for love of the mony, or out of hatred to the True Christian Religion, sought divers ways to play the <HI>Judas,</HI> and at last obtained his purpose, apprehending him, and sending him to <HI>London,</HI> where he was soon af∣ter drawn through the Streets, to the new Gallows in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s <HI>Fields,</HI> and there first hanged, and then burnt on the Gallows, and this was the end of this Godly Martyr of Jesus Christ; and though the Papists charge him with Treason, yet we know it hath ever been the practice of the Devil and his Instruments to accuse Gods Servants rather for Sedition than Religion, because they per∣ceive Princes are generally more careful of their own Honour, than Gods Glory; for thus they dealt with our Blessed Saviour, and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who were accused for Disloyalty, and stirring up Tumults; But the Almighty did not suffer his death to go unpunished, for the Arch∣bishop who sate in Judgment upon him, and condem∣ned him, was soon after struck with a disease in his Tongue, that he could neither swallow any thing, nor speak a word some days before his death, by which means he was starved to death. <HI>Robert Devereux,</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> was born in this County in 1567. He was a Masterpiece of Court and Camp, and came with many advantages to the Court of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who passio∣nately loving his Person, sent him once an angry loving Letter for going into <HI>France,</HI> often saying, <HI>We shall have this young Fellow knocked on the head, as foolish</HI> Sydney <HI>was, by his own forwardness,</HI> and was impatient till his return; after this upon some misdemeanors he was brought to a private Tryal, wherein some words in his Letters were produced against him, as that, <HI>No storm is more fierce than the indignation of an Impotent Prince, what, cannot Princes err? May they not injure their Subjects?</HI> These things be∣ing proved, he falling on his knees, professed he would not contest with the Queen, nor excuse the faults of his young years, protesting that he alwaies meant well, and therewith shed so many tears as made the Spectators weep too; he was then censured, but the Queen soon

forgave him, however he retired into the Country, and remembred himself to the Queen by the L. <HI>Howard</HI> in these words; <HI>That he kissed the rod, and the Queens hands, which had only corrected, not overthrown him; yet he should ne∣ver enjoy solid comfort till he might see those blessed Eyes, which had been his loadstars whereby he had happily steered his course while he held on his way at lawful distance; But now he re∣solved to eat grass with</HI> Nebuchadnezzar, <HI>till it pleased the Queen to restore his senses;</HI> she being overjoyed with these Speeches; <HI>Would to God,</HI> said she, <HI>his deeds would be answerable to his words; he hath long tried my patience, I must now make tryal of his Humility;</HI> Upon which the Earl be∣came so confident of the Queens favour, that being de∣nyed a Suit about farming sweet wines, he conspired with others to seize her Person, and which more aliena∣ted her affections than any thing else, she heard he de∣spised her Person, and that he had said, <HI>That the Queen was now old and decrepit, and withered as well in mind as in body;</HI> After this he made an Insurrection in <HI>London,</HI> which not succeeding he was sent to the Tower, and being arraigned (together with the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI>) by his Peers, was found guilty, and <HI>Feb.</HI> 25. 1601. was to be the fatal day; in the mean time divers Ministers were sent to comfort him; The Queen now wavered in her self, one while remembring former kindnesses, she would not, and then again she would have him die, be∣cause of his stubborness in not asking her mercy, and his openly saying, <HI>That he could not live, but she must perish;</HI> So that she gave order for his death within the <HI>Tower,</HI> where he spake to this Purpose; <HI>My Lords and Christian Bre∣thren who are present witnesses of my just punishment; I confess to Gods Glory, my self a most wretched Sinner, and that my sins in number exceed the hairs of my head, that good which I would have done, I did not, and the evil which I would not, that did I, for all which I beseech my Saviour Christ to be a Mediator, but especially for this my last crying sin; I beseech God, Her Ma∣jesty, and the State to forgive me, and bless her with a prospe∣rous Reign, with a wise and understanding Heart, to bless the Nobles, and Ministers of the Church and State; I likewise be∣seech

<P><HI>HƲNTINGTONSHIRE</HI> is surrounded with <HI>Northampton, Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Cambridgeshires,</HI> being small in extent, hardly stretching 20 miles outright, though measured to the most advantage; it is good for Corn and Tillage, and toward the East very plentiful for feeding Cattle; <HI>Huntington</HI> is the chief Town of all the County, called in their publick Seal <HI>Huntersdune, The Hill or Down of Hunters,</HI> and gives name to all the Shire; <HI>Godmanchester</HI> is a very great Country Town, and of as great repute for Tillage; no place having more Ploughs, or more stout Husbandmen, for they boast that in for∣mer times they have received the Kings of <HI>England</HI> as they passed in their progress this way, with ninescore Ploughs, brought forth in a rustical kind of Pomp, as a Gallant show; when K. <HI>James</HI> came first into <HI>England,</HI> the Bayliffs of this Town presented him with 70 Team of Horses, all traced to fair new Ploughs, to shew their Husbandry; of which when the King demanded the reason, they told him, <HI>That it was their ancient Custom, whensoever any King of</HI> England <HI>passed through their Town, so to present him;</HI> And added further, <HI>That they held their Lands by that Tenure being the Kings Tenants;</HI> The King was much pleased herewith, bidding them use well their

<P>There are two little Springs at <HI>Ayleweston</HI> in this Coun∣ty, the one fresh and the other somewhat brackish; the latter they say is good for Scabs and Leprosie, and the other for dim sights: The Lake of <HI>Wittlesmere,</HI> and other Meers near it in this Shire, do sometimes rise tempestu∣ously in calm and fair Weather, and make Water-quakes by reason the ground near it is rotten and hollow, as some think, which occasions vapours to break violently out of the Earth: The Natives who dwell about these Meers are healthy, and live long, but strangers are sub∣ject to much sickness. In the Year 1580. <HI>Sept.</HI> 23. at <HI>Fennystanton</HI> in this County one <HI>Agnes,</HI> Wife to <HI>William Linsey,</HI> was delivered of an ugly strange Monster, with a black Face, Mouth and Eyes like a Lion, which was both Male and Female. In 1584. there happened a strange thing at <HI>Spaldwick</HI> in this Shire; Mr. <HI>Dorrington,</HI> one of the Gentlemen Pensioners to Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> had a Horse which died suddenly, and being opened to see the cause of his Death, there was found in his heart a Worm of a wondrous form, as it lay together in a kall or skin, it resembled a Toad, but being taken thence the shape was hard to be described; the length of it di∣vided into 80 Grains, (which spread from the Body like the branches of a Tree) was from the snout to the end of the longest grain 17 Inches, having 4 Issues in the grains, from whence dropped a red Water; the Body was 3 Inches and an half about, the Collar being like that of a Mackrel; this prodigious Worm crawling about to have got away was killed with a Dagger, and being dried was shewed to many Honourable Persons as a great rarity.</P>
<P>We read that <HI>Henry Holland,</HI> Duke of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and E. of <HI>Huntington,</HI> who married the Sister of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 4.

It is observed by Mr. <HI>Speed,</HI> that the ancient Families of this County have been more outworn proportionably than in any other, few now remaining whose Sir-names were eminent in the Reign of K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. the reason whereof may probably be, because this Shire being generally Ab∣by Lands, after their dissolution, many new purchasers planted themselves therein; But,

They glory that they were never conquered, but were compounded with by the <HI>Norman</HI> Conqueror, of whom our <HI>English</HI> Poet writes thus:

Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Abbot of St. <HI>Austins,</HI> who were the chief Lords and Governours of <HI>Kent</HI> un∣derstood, they assembled the Commons, and told them of the dangers of their Country, the miseries of their Neighbours, the Pride of the <HI>French,</HI> and that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> till then were born free, and the name of Villains or Bondsmen not heard among them; <HI>but now slavery only attends us,</HI> said he, <HI>if we submit to the insolency of our Enemies;</HI> And therefore these two Prelates offered to command them, and to dye with them in the defence of their Freedom and Country, whereby the People were so extreamly encouraged, that they concluded to meet at a day appointed at <HI>Swanscomb,</HI> two Miles West from <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where being come accordingly, and keeping themselves private in the Woods, they waited the coming of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, filling up all the way by which he was to pass, with each of them a great green Bough in his hand, whereby they might hide their number from being discovered, and if occasi∣on were, fall upon the <HI>Normans;</HI> the next day the Duke came by <HI>Swanscomb,</HI> and was much amazed to see a Wood as it were marching toward him, for being as he thought free from the Enemy, he was now beset on all sides with Trees, and knew not but all the other vast Woods thereabout were of the same nature, neither had he leisure to avoid the danger, for the <HI>Kentish</HI> men imme∣diately enclosing his Army about, displayed their Ban∣ners, and throwing down their Branches, at the sound of a Trumpet, prepare their Bows and Arrows ready for a Fight; so that the Conqueror, who just before thought he had the whole Kingdom absolutely at Com∣mand, began now to despair of his own Life; of which Consternation the two valiant Prelates taking advantage, presented themselves to the Duke, and thus addressed him in behalf of their followers: <HI>Most noble Duke, behold here the Commons of</HI> Kent <HI>are come forth to meet and receive you as their Soveraign in peace, upon condition they may for ever enjoy their ancient Liberties, Freedoms, and Estates, which they received from their Forefathers; If these be denied, they are

here ready to give you battle immediately, being fully resolved rather to die, than to part with our ancient Laws, or to live in slavery and bondage, the name and nature whereof as it hath been hitherto unknown to us, so we will rather every man lose his Life than ever endure it.</HI> The Conqueror driven to a strait, and loth to hazard all upon so nice a point, their demands being not unreasonable, rather wisely than willingly granted their desires, and Pledges on both sides are given for performance, <HI>Kent</HI> yielding her Earl∣dom and Castle of <HI>Dover</HI> to her new King <HI>William:</HI> A∣mong other Customs they retain one called <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> that is, <HI>Give all kin,</HI> whereby Lands are divided among the Male-Children, or, if there be no Sons, among the Daughters, by which every man is a Freeholder, and hath some part of his own to live upon: By vertue of this also they are at full age, and enter upon their Inhe∣ritance at 15 Years old, and it is lawful for them to ali∣enate or make it over to any, either by Gift or sale, without the Lords Consent: By this likewise the Son, though his Parents be hanged for Felony or Murder, succeedeth them nevertheless, in such kind of Lands ac∣cording to that Rhime,

<P><HI>Canterbury</HI> is the chief City of this County, ancient and famous no doubt in the time of the <HI>Romans;</HI> The Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was called, <HI>Totius Angliae Pri∣mas,</HI> Primate of all <HI>England,</HI> the Archbishop of <HI>York</HI> on∣ly <HI>Primas Angliae,</HI> Primate of <HI>England;</HI> he is the first Peer of the Realm, and hath the Precedency of all Dukes not of the Royal Blood or great Officers of State, <HI>Anselm</HI> in recompence of his service in opposing the Marriage of Priests, and resisting the King about investing Bishops, had this accession of honour given him by Pope <HI>Ʋrbane, That he and his Successors should have place at the Popes right foot in all General Councils,</HI> the Pope adding these words, <HI>We include him in our Orb, as Pope of a∣nother world.</HI> This City hath had a rare Cathedral, it is in the midst of the Town, the body within being near as large as St. <HI>Pauls</HI> in <HI>London</HI> was; between the body and the Quire there hangeth a Bell called by the name of Bell <HI>Harry,</HI> being one of those which <HI>Henry</HI> 8. brought out of <HI>France;</HI> there are also four Spires like St. <HI>Sepulchres London;</HI> on each side of the great West Gate are 2 other Steeples, the one called <HI>Dunstan,</HI> and the other <HI>Arnold</HI> Steeples, in each of which are a very pleasant ring of Bells; in the same Cathedral there was the famousest window in <HI>England,</HI> for which they say the <HI>Spanish</HI> Am∣bassador offered Ten Thousand pound; being the whole History of Christ from his Nativity to his Passion, but it was afterward battered to pieces; In the Quire of the Cathedral, <HI>Edward,</HI> called the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> is buried in a Monument of Brass; underneath this Cathedral there is a great Congregation of <HI>French</HI> Protestants, the <HI>Dutch</HI> also have a Church in that Place, which is called the <HI>Bishops Pallace;</HI> there are many other Churches in the City and Suburbs.</P>
<P>It is reported by the Monks of that Age, that in the year 619. <HI>Canterbury</HI> being accidentally on fire, which
<PB N="116" REF="62"/>
raged so extreamly against all opposition, that the grea∣test part of the City was almost burnt down, and the furious flashes thereof extended to the Bishops Pallace, whereupon <HI>Melitus</HI> the Archbishop seeing mans help fail and trusting to Divine Assistance, commanded him∣self to be carried out of his house, and set against the fiercest flames, which were it seems in the place of the Martyrdom of four Saints, where the Bishop being ac∣cordingly placed, though grievously tormented with the Gout, yet went to Prayers, when behold the wind sud∣denly turned, and thereby the fire was soon after won∣derfully quenched. In the Reign of K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. 1172. <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who was Ca∣nonized by the Pope, though an Arch-Traitor to his King and Country, being murthered, was at first obscure∣ly buried, but afterward his body was taken up, and laid in a most sumptuous shrine in the East end of the Cathe∣dral by <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> his Successor; To this new shri∣ned Martyr, People of all degrees, and from all parts flocked in Pilgrimage, loading his Tomb with such large Offerings, that the Church all round about did a∣bound with more than Princely Riches, the meanest part being of pure Gold, garnished with many precious Stones; the chiefest whereof was a rich Jewel offered by K. <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who required, and we may be sure was told he had obtained, having bought it so dear, <HI>That no Passenger between</HI> Dover <HI>and</HI> Whitesand <HI>shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> perish by Shipwrack.</HI> There was such pressing to touc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> St. <HI>Thomas</HI> his body, and such creeping and kneeling to his Tomb, that the Prints of their Devotion, saith <HI>Lam∣bert,</HI> appear to this day in the Marble Stones, and every Pillar resounded the Miracles of this reputed Martyr, yea the Church itself which was dedicated to Christ, was forced to give place to the name of St. <HI>Thomas;</HI> his blood was almost matched in virtue with our Blessed Sa∣viours, and his old shoe was devoutly kissed by all Pas∣sengers; <HI>John Stow</HI> thus describeth the Shrine; it was built, saith he, about a mans height all of Stone, and from thence upward of Timber, within which was a

Divers Epitaphs, and An∣thems were composed in memory of this Martyr, and this among others.</P>

<P>The Pope likewise writ to the <HI>English</HI> Clergy to make a new Holyday for St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> as they expected pardon through his Intercession to God for them; At <HI>Halbaldown</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> there was an Hospital erected by Archbishop <HI>Lanfrank,</HI> wherein was reserved the upper leather of an old shoe, which they said had been worn by St. <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> and being set fair in Copper and Christal, was offered to be kissed by all Passengers. In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> 3. there was great variance be∣tween the A. Bishops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> and the <HI>Londoners</HI> were cursed by the A. B. of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> be∣cause they suffered he of <HI>York</HI> to carry his Cross in that City, but the King ended the difference, ordering they should both freely carry the Cross in each others Pro∣vince, but that in sign of subjection, the A. B. of <HI>York</HI> should send the Image of an Archbishop, bearing a Cross, or some other Jewel wrought in fine gold, to the value of 40 pounds to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and offer it publickly there upon St. <HI>Thomas Beckets</HI> Shrine; They likewise report
<PB N="118" REF="64"/>
that <HI>Thomas</HI> lying in an old House at <HI>Otford,</HI> and finding it want a Spring, he struck his Staff into the dry ground, from whence issued Water, and is called to this day St. <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> Well; and that a Nightingale disturbing his Devotions one time in that place, he commanded that from thence∣forth no bird of that kind should dare sing there; many o∣ther such ridiculous miracles are reported, which were invented by <HI>Popish</HI> Knaves, and believed by none but <HI>Popish</HI> Idiots. In 1386. <HI>William Courtney</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> summoned certain of his Tenants to answer an heinous and horrible Trespass, as he called it, which was, <HI>That they brought Straw to litter his Horses, not in Carts as formerly, but in Bags;</HI> for which wicked Offence, having confes∣sed their fault, and asked him forgiveness, he enjoined them this Pennance, That going leisurely before the Procession barefoot, and bare leg'd, each of them should carry upon his Shoulder a Bag stuffed with Strow hang∣ing out, whereupon these Rhimes were made:
<Q><L>This Bag full of straw I bear on my Back,</L>
<L>Because my Lords Horse his Litter did lack;</L>
<L>If you be not the better to my Lord Graces Horse.</L>
<L>You are like to go barefoot before the Cross.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the Reign of K. <HI>James</HI> Dr. <HI>George Abbot</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> being hunting in a Park, and shooting at a Deer, his Arrow by mischance glanced and killed a man; upon which Fact it was much debated, whether by it he were not become irregular, and ought to be de∣prived of his Archbishoprick, as having imbrued his hands (though unwillingly) in Blood; but Bishop <HI>An∣drews</HI> of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and Sir <HI>Hen. Martin</HI> Advocate, de∣fended him, giving such reasons for mitigation of the Fact, that he was cleared from all imputation of crime, and thereupon judged regular, and in state to continue in his Archiepiscopal Charge; yet out of a religious ten∣derness of mind, he kept that day in which the mis∣chance happened as a solemn fast all his life after. In the Year 1553. <HI>Nicholas Wotton,</HI> Dean of <HI>Canterbury</HI> be∣ing
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>
then Ambassadour in <HI>France,</HI> dreamed that his Ne∣phew <HI>Thomas Wotton</HI> was inclined to be a Party in such a Project, as if he were not suddenly prevented, would turn to the loss of his Life, and ruine of his Family; the night following he dreamed the same again, and knowing that it had no influence upon his waking thoughts, and much less the desires of his heart, he did then more seriously consider it, and resolved to use so prudent a Remedy by way of prevention, as might be no great inconvenience to either party, and thereupon writ a Letter to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> that she would cause his Nephew to be sent for out of <HI>Kent,</HI> and that the Coun∣cil might interrogate him in such feigned Questions as might colour his Commitment into a favourable Prison, of which he would hereafter give Her Majesty the true Reason; this was done accordingly, and soon after the Queen being married to K. <HI>Philip,</HI> divers persons decla∣red, and raised forces against it, among whom Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Wiat</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI> (with whom the Family of the <HI>Wot∣tons</HI> had an entire Friendship) was the Principal, who being defeated, suffered death with many others, for the same; and of this number Mr. <HI>Wotton</HI> in all probability had been, for he afterward confessed to his Uncle that he had some strong intimation of <HI>Wiat</HI>'s design, and be∣lieved he should have been engaged in it, if his Uncle had not so happily dreamed him into a Prison. Thus much for <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rochester</HI> is another City and Bishops See in this Coun∣ty; the Cathedral is low and little, saith Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> pro∣portional to the Revennues thereof, yet hath it, though no Magnificence, a venerable aspect of antiquity there∣in: There was a Castle built in K. <HI>William</HI>'s time, but now all in ruines: In the woful Wars of the Barons when K. <HI>John</HI> was viewing this Castle held against him by the E. of <HI>Arundel,</HI> he was espied by a very good Archer, who told the Earl thereof, adding, <HI>That if he would but say the word, he would quickly dispatch the cruel Tyrant; God forbid, vile Varlet,</HI> said the Earl, <HI>that we should procure the death of the Holy One of God: Why,</HI> said the Souldier, <HI>he
<PB N="120" REF="65"/>
would not spare you if he had you at the like advantage: No matter for that,</HI> said the Earl, <HI>let Gods Will be done, he will dispose thereof, but let us not hurt the King. Chatham</HI> joins to this City, and is now one of the Royal Docks for build∣ing Ships, of which this story is recorded: It happened the dead Corps of a man was cost ashore in this Town, and being taken up was buried decently in the Church-Yard, now there was an Image or Rood in the Church, called our Lady of <HI>Chatham,</HI> this Lady, say the Monks, went next night and roused up the Clerk, telling him that a sinful person was buried near the place where she was worshipped, who offended her Eyes with his ghastly grinning, and unless he were removed, to the great grief of good People she must remove from thence, and could work no more miracles, therefore desired him to go with her to take him up, and throw him into the River again; which being done, soon after the Body floated again, and was again taken up and buried in the Church-Yard; but from that time all miracles ceased, and the place where he was buried did continually sink downward; this Tale is still remembred by some aged People, receiving it by tradition from the <HI>Popish</HI> times of darkness and Idolatry. In the Reign of K. <HI>Will. Rufus</HI> all the Lands in <HI>Kent</HI> sometime belonging to Earl <HI>God∣win</HI> were by breaking in of the Sea covered with sands, and are called <HI>Godwins Sands</HI> to this day; It is said, that <HI>Thira</HI> a <HI>Dane, Godwins</HI> Wife, used to make Merchandise of the beautiful Virgins of <HI>England,</HI> by selling them to <HI>Denmark</HI> at a dear rate, seeking thereby to satisfie her own Covetousness and the <HI>Danes</HI> Lusts, which practice she continued till Divine Vengeance fell upon her by a Thunderbolt from Heaven, whereby she was slain. In 1199. The Town of <HI>Malling</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> with the Nun∣nery were consumed with Fire. In 1216. about <HI>Maid∣stone</HI> a certain Monster was found struck with Lightning which had an head like an Ass, a belly like a Man, and all other parts far differing from any other Creature. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the first of Q. <HI>Mary</HI> the bravest Ship then in <HI>England,</HI> cal∣led the <HI>Great Harry,</HI> being of Burden a Thousand Tun,

was burnt by negligence at <HI>Woolwich:</HI> About the same time the Parson of <HI>Crondall</HI> near <HI>Canterbury</HI> preaching up∣on a <HI>Shrove Sunday,</HI> went besides his Text into an imper∣tinent discourse in commendation of the Popes Articles lately set forth, and in disgracing the Protestant Religi∣on, speaking thus to the People; <HI>My Masters and Neigh∣bours, rejoyce and be merry, for the Prodigal Son is come home; for I know your hearts well enough, that the most of you are like my self, and I shall tell you what happened to me this Week; I have been with my Lord Cardinal</HI> Pool, <HI>and he hath made me as clean from my Sins as I was at the Font-stone, and he hath also appointed me to publish unto you the Bull of the Popes Par∣don,</HI> (reading it to them, and adding,) he thanked God that ever he lived to see that day, and he believed by vertue of that Bull he was clean from sin as the Night he was born; which words he had no sooner uttered, but he was struck with sudden death, and never stirred more, to the astonishment of the Spectators.</P>
<P>In 1575. a vast mighty Whale was cast upon the Isle of <HI>Thanet</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> Twenty Ells long, and 13 Foot broad from the belly to the backbone, and his Tail as broad; the nether Jaw was 12 Foot, and as much between the Eyes, some of his Ribs were 15 Foot long, and so was his Tongue; one of his Eyes being taken out of his Head was more than a Cart with 6 Horses could draw, the Oyl being boiled out of the Head was <HI>Parmacitte.</HI> In 1548. one Mr. Mr. <HI>Arden</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI> by procurement of his Wife was murdered in his own House; being dead, his Body was carried out and laid on the ground in a Close hard by, where this is memorable; that for two Years after, the ground where his Body lay bore no grass, but still represented as it were a picture of his Body, only in the space between his Legs and Arms there grew Grass, but where any part of his Body touched, none at all; yet this miraculous accident was not, it may be, so much for the Murder, as for the Curses of a Widow Woman, out of whose hands this Mr. <HI>Arden</HI> had bought this very Close, to her utter undoing; and thus Divine Justice even in this World oftentimes works Miracles upon Of∣fenders,

for a merciful warning to others, if they will be so wise to take it. In 1585. <HI>Aug.</HI> 4. a marvellous accident happened in the Hamlet of <HI>Mottingham</HI> near <HI>El∣tham,</HI> in this County, in a field belonging to Sir <HI>Perci∣val Hart;</HI> betimes in the morning the ground began to sink so much, that three great Elm Trees were suddenly swallowed into the Pit, the Tops falling downward in∣to the hole, and before 10 a Clock they were so over∣whelmed, that no part of them could be discerned, the place being suddenly filled with Water; the compass of the whole was about 80 Yards, and so deep, that a sound∣ing line of 50 fathoms could hardly find or feel any bot∣tom, ten yards distance from this place there was ano∣ther piece of ground sunk in the same manner near the Highway, and so nigh a dwelling House, that the Inhabi∣tants were greatly terrified thereby.</P>
<P>In 1602. <HI>April</HI> 20. Thirteen Persons were slain by misfortune at the Gunpowder Mill at <HI>Redriff,</HI> and much more hurt done in divers places. <HI>Nicholas Wood</HI> of <HI>Har∣rison</HI> in this County, Yeoman, did with ease eat a whole Sheep of 16 shillings price, and that raw, at one meal; another time he eat 30 dozen of Pigeons; at Sir <HI>William Sidlys</HI> he eat as much as would have sufficed 30 men; at the Lord <HI>Wottons</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> he eat at one meal 84 Rabbets, which number would have sufficed 168 men, allowing to each half a Rabbet; he suddenly devoured 18 yards of black pudding, <HI>London</HI> measure, and having once eat 60 pound weight of Cherries, he said they were but washmeat; he made an end of a whole Hog at once, and after it swallowed three pecks of Damasons, this was after break-fast, for he said he had eat one pottle of milk, one pottle of pottage with Bread, Butter, and Cheese before: he eat in my presence, saith <HI>Taylor the Water Poet,</HI> six penny Wheaten Loaves, three six penny Veal Pies, one pound of sweet Butter, one good dish of Thornback, and a shiver of a peck Houshold Loaf an inch thick, and all this in the space of an hour; the House yielded no more, and so he went away unsatisfi∣ed; one <HI>John Dale</HI> was too hard for him at a place called
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>
<HI>Lenham,</HI> he laid a Wager he could fill <HI>Woods</HI> belly with good wholsome Victuals for 2 Shillings, and a Gentleman waged on the contrary, that when he had eaten out <HI>Dales</HI> two shillings, he should then presently eat up a whole good Sirloine of Beef; <HI>Dale</HI> bought six pots of mighty Ale, and 12 new penny white Loaves, which he sopped therein, the powerful fume whereof conquered this Conqueror, and laid him in a sleep, to the preservation of the roast Beef, and unexpected winning of the wager; he spent all his Estate to pro∣vide provant for his belly, and though a landed Man, and a true Labourer, died very poor about 1630.</P>
<P>In 1652. One <HI>Adam Sprackling</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> lived at St. <HI>Law∣rence</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> he had a fair Estate, and Mar∣ried Sir <HI>Robert Lewkners</HI> Daughter, but growing extream∣ly debauched, brought himself into many troubles, and spent his Estate; This Gentleman coming home one night, fell into a great rage against his Wife, who was a very virtuous Lady, and resolving to mischief her, he first struck her with his Dagger, hurting her Jaw, which she bore patiently, saying little to him; He raged still more against her, and she rising to go away, he struck her with a chopping knife on the wrist, and cut the bone in sunder; he then dashed her on the fore-head with the Iron Cleaver, whereupon she fell down bleeding, but recovering her self on her knees, she prayed God to forgive her Husband his Sins, as she did; and likewise to pardon her own sins; while she was thus praying, her bloody Husband chopt her head in the midst, even to the very brains, so that she fell down dead immediately, then did he kill 6 Dogs, 4 of which he threw by his Wife, and chopped her twice into the Leg after she was dead; being apprehended for this horrid murther, he was carried to <HI>Sandwich</HI> Goal, and was Tryed, Condem∣ned and Executed for the same, dying very desperately; and refusing to discourse either with Ministers or Gen∣tlemen who came thither to speak to him.</P>
<P>In 1655. Sir <HI>George Sonds</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI> had two Sons grown up to that Age, wherein he might have expected
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>
most comfort from them, but the younger of them ha∣ving no apparent cause, or provocation, either from his Father or Brother, did in a most unnatural and barba∣rous manner murther his elder Brother, concerning which, Sir <HI>George</HI> in a Narrative written by himself, useth these expressions; <HI>For my Sons wickedness, I must needs say</HI> Cains <HI>was not greater, for he did it in the Field, and first talked with his Brother, and had some pretence of reason for it, and because</HI> Abel, <HI>and his offering was more respected, but thou,</HI> saies he, <HI>didst murther thy Brother basely and inhu∣manly, not in the Field, but in his Bed, thou didst not talk and dispute it with him, but didst kill him sleeping, and couldst hear nothing but sad groans from him; nor didst thou do it with a Sword or manly weapon, but with a butcherly Cleaver didst beat out his brains, and as if that had been too little, with a most cowardly Steeletto didst stab him</HI> 7 <HI>or</HI> 8 <HI>times in and about the heart; thou couldst have no such pretence as</HI> Cain <HI>had, for thou wast ever equally respected with thy Brother; Even pro∣phane</HI> Esau <HI>came short of thee, he did but resolve to kill his Brother, but when he met him he repented and imbraced him, but thou didst go through with thy work, in the height of malice, and when thou hadst brought me to him, after thou hadst slain him, I saw not any relenting in thee, not one tear to drop from thine eyes for that foul Fact;</HI> Judas <HI>did betray his innocent Master, but thou didst more, for thou didst kill thy innocent Brother;</HI> Judas <HI>did but deliver up his Master to the Judge for Tryal; but thou wast Judge and Executioner thy self; He might plead that the Devil (after he had taken the Sop) entered into him, and that he was hired for</HI> 30 <HI>pieces of Silver; thou hadst no Devil, nor any hire but thy own malicious nature; he did it in the dark night, as ashamed that the Light should see so foul a Fact; But thou in the fair morning when the Sun was risen, and shined clear; He gave his Master time to pray before he took him; but thou didst kill thy Brother sleeping, not suffe∣ring him to wake or speak, only to sigh and groan, and that most sadly, yet all moved thee not,</HI> &amp;c. This young man was soon after deservedly Executed for this horrid Fratricide, &amp; so this worthy Knight lost both his Sons at one time.</P>

A Whale came up the <HI>Thames</HI> as high as <HI>Deptford,</HI> and being discovered at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> many Boats made out after her, and a Marriner struck her with an harping Iron, whereupon she spouted forth much water and blood, and roared like a Lyon, and so beating her self up and down till she came below <HI>Greenwich,</HI> she there turned up her Belly and died; she was 59 foot long, and 15 foot high as she lay on her Belly; <HI>September</HI> 3. following, <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> dyed, three days before which there was such a Tem∣pestuous, and violent wind as overthrew divers Houses, brake and overturned many Trees by the roots, and did much mischief. In 1660. <HI>August</HI> 4. At <HI>Dover</HI> from 10 a clock at night till 2 next morning, were such storms of Hail, accompanied with Thunder and Lightning, as the like was never known, some of the Hailstones that fell were as big as Walnuts, and were measured 4 inches a∣bout; the damage was reckoned 50 pound in glass Windows which were broken. In 1662. <HI>July</HI> 2. about 3 in the afternoon there happened a very strange whirl∣wind in <HI>Mason Dufield</HI> between the Town and Castle of <HI>Dover,</HI> at the upper end of which Field the wind took up divers sheafs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wards of Pease, a vast height into the Air, and carried them over the Town into the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and it was judged they were carried two or three miles before they fell into the Sea; it also took up some Calves and other small Cattle, and threw them into a Ditch; a

Also much about the same time, and nine miles from this place, many credible Persons often saw a very dread∣ful Serpent come forth out of a Wood, the length there∣of being about five or six yards, and they judged it to be bigger than the biggest Cart Axel Tree; it was so great that some who viewed the place where it sometimes lay, near a Well at <HI>Dunkin Hall,</HI> affirm, that it made such an impression on the ground, as if an Ox or some more large and pounderous Beast had lain there.

The Earl of <HI>Richmond</HI> likewise sent to the L. <HI>Stanly,</HI> to repair pre∣sently to him, but he sent word, he must expect no aid from him till the Battles were joined, and therefore ad∣vised him with all possible speed to give the onset; which Answer somewhat staggered the Earl, because his num∣ber did but a little exceed one half of the Kings, yet to make the best shew he could, by the advice of his Coun∣cil of War, he made the Front of his Army thin and broad, of which the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> had the leading, the Earl himself leading the Battle; soon after the Fight be∣gun, and the Arrows being spent on both sides, they came to handstroaks, and just then came in the Lord <HI>Stanly</HI> to the Earls assistance; while they were thus con∣tending K. <HI>Richard</HI> was informed, that the Earl of <HI>Richmond</HI> with a small number was not far off, and there∣upon being of an invincible courage, whereof he was now to give the last proof, he made toward him, and gave such a furious assault, that first with his own hands he slew Sir <HI>William Brandon</HI> who bore the Earls Stand∣ard, next he unhorst and overthrew Sir <HI>John Chyney</HI> a stout man at Arms; and then assaulted the Earl of <HI>Rich∣mond</HI> himself, who unexpectedly, for all the Kings fury, held him off at the Lances point till Sir <HI>Wm.

<P>Yet notwithstanding this warning, this noble Duke continued firm to K. <HI>Richard,</HI> and lost his Life in his quarrel: The whole number slain in this Battle on K. <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>'s side was about 1000 Persons; Sir <HI>Wm. Catesby</HI> one of the chief Counsellors of K. <HI>Richard,</HI> with divers others, were two days after beheaded at <HI>Leicester:</HI> This Battle was fought <HI>Aug.</HI> 20. 1485. continuing a little above two hours: The Earl Knighted several persons in the Field, and then kneeling down he rendred hearty Thanks to Almighty God for the Victory he had obtained, and commanded all the wounded men to be cured; whereat the People rejoycing clapt their hands and cried K. <HI>Hen∣ry,</HI> K. <HI>Henry,</HI> of which joy Sir <HI>W. Stanly</HI> taking opportu∣nity, he took the Crown of K. <HI>Richard,</HI> which was found among the spoils in the Field, and set it on the Earls Head, as though he had been elected King by the voice of the People. The Body of K. <HI>Richard</HI> after he was slain was script and left naked to the very skin, not so much as a rag being left about him to cover his nakedness, and being taken up was trussed behind a pursivant at Arms, his Head and Arms hanging on one side the Horse, and his Legs on the other; thus all besmeared with Blood and dirt, he was brought to the <HI>Gray Friars</HI> Church in <HI>Leicester,</HI> and there for some time lay a mise∣rable spectacle, and afterward with small Funeral Pomp
<PB N="132" REF="71"/>
was there buried; But K. <HI>Henry</HI> 7. afterward caused a Tomb to be set over the place, with his Picture in Ala∣baster, which at the suppression of that Monastery was utterly defaced, since when his Grave overgrown with Nettles and Weeds, is not to be found, only the stone Chest wherein his Corps lay, is now made a drinking Trough for Horses at a common Inn in <HI>Leicester,</HI> and re∣taineth only the memory of this Monarchs greatness; but his body is reported to have been carried out of the City, and contemptuously laid under the end of <HI>Bow-Bridge</HI> near that Town; it is likewise said, that upon this Bridg there stood a stone of some height, against which, K. <HI>Richard</HI> as he passed toward <HI>Bosworth,</HI> by chance struck his spur, which a Witch or wise Woman obser∣ving, she should say; <HI>That where his spur struck, his head should be broken,</HI> as they say it was, when he was brought back dead. He lived 37 years, and reigned two years and two months; it is memorable that this Sir <HI>William Stanly,</HI> who so seasonably saved K. <HI>Henries</HI> life, and set the Crown on his head, was about 11 years after upon pretence of some dangerous words, beheaded at <HI>Tower∣hill</HI> by order of the same King <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wanly</HI> writes, that in St. <HI>Martins</HI> Church in <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI> there is this very remarkable Epitaph to be seen; <HI>Here lies the body of</HI> John Heyrick <HI>of this Parish, who died</HI> 1589. <HI>aged</HI> 76 <HI>years, who lived with his Wife</HI> Mary <HI>in one House full</HI> 62 <HI>years, and had issue by her,</HI> 5 <HI>Sons, and seven Daugh∣ters, and in all that time never buried Man, Woman nor Child, though they were somtime</HI> 20 <HI>in Houshold; the said</HI> Mary <HI>li∣ved to</HI> 97 <HI>years, and died</HI> 1611. <HI>She did see before her depar∣ture, of her Children, and Childrens Children, and their Chil∣dren to the number of</HI> 142. <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> relates of a Maid in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> who being exactly watched, was found in seven years together, neither to eat nor drink, but only that on <HI>Sundays</HI> she received the Sacrament, and yet continued fat, and good liking; which if true, we may well believe that in the Resurrection our life may be maintained without meat or drink. About <HI>Lut∣terworth</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> a Miller had murdered one in his

Mill, and privately buried him in a ground hard by; this Miller removed into another Country, and there li∣ved a long space, till at last guided by the Providence of God for the manifestation of his Justice, he returned unto that place to visit some of his Friends; while he was there, the Miller who now had the Mill, had occasion to dig deep in that very place, where he found the Carkass of a man; this known, it pleased God to put it into their hearts to remember a Neighbour of theirs who 20 years before was suddenly missed, and since that time not heard of; and bethinking themselves who was then Miller of that Mill, behold he was ready in Town, not having been there for many years before; this man was suspected, &amp; thereupon examined, &amp; without much a∣do confessed the Fact, &amp; was accordingly executed for the same. In 1660. <HI>Sep.</HI> 3. near <HI>Worthington</HI> in this County there happened a dreadful Whirlwind which tore up a great Tree by the Roots, casting it four or five yards from the place, rent off the great limbs of an Apple-Tree, and threw down a House in the Street; the Chap∣pel was much shaken, and the Chancel in danger of fal∣ling; then it passed on with great force and noise to <HI>Wor∣thington</HI> Hall, where it overturned five Bay of Barn-building, and a Gate-house, it blew down a stack of Chimnies, and hurried a man into the Garden, who by catching hold of a Tree stayed himself; at another Town, it rent a House, where a woman and three Chil∣dren were miraculously preserved, to which it brought a great Log of Wood, no body knew from whence; it carried away a Hive of Bees, and a load of Thorns, which could not be heard of, and turned up 20 Load of Wood by the roots; this whirlwind ran about three miles in length, and not above 20 yards in breadth, some said there were flames of fire seen in it. Upon the 24. of <HI>January</HI> following, between six and seven a clock at night there was a very great Earthquake in most parts of <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> which came at first like a noise in the Air at great distance, it shook the Houses very much, and in some places men could hardly stand without holding;

the continuance thereof was about a quarter of an hour.

Sir <HI>Robert Belknap,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Com∣mon Pleas in K. <HI>Richard</HI> 2. time was of this County, and that K. having a design to destroy certain Lords, sent for the Judges to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> where the Kings many questi∣ons were in fine resolved into this, <HI>Whether he might by his Regal Power revoke what was acted in Parliament;</HI> to this all the Judges, Sir <HI>William Skipwith</HI> alone excepted, an∣swered Affirmatively, and subscribed it, though this <HI>Belknap</HI> did it unwillingly, as foreseeing the danger, and putting to his Seal, said these words; <HI>There wants nothing now but an Hurdle, an Horse, and an Halter to carry me where I may suffer the death I deserve; for if I had not done this, I should have dyed for it, and because I have done it, I deserve death for betraying the Lords.</HI> Yet it had been more for his credit to have adventured Martyrdom in defence of the Laws, than to hazard the death of a Malefactor in the breach thereof; but Judges are but men, and most men desire to decline that danger which they think nearest to them; but he and the other Judges were con∣demned for High-Treason in the next <HI>Wonder working Parliament,</HI> and hardly had escaped death, if the Queen had not earnestly interceeded for them.</P>

<P>In 1666. <HI>Oct.</HI> 13. there was an extraordinary and dreadful Storm of Thunder in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> accompa∣nied with Hailstones much bigger than Pigeons, and some as large as Pullets Eggs; immediately after there followed a terrible storm and Tempest, attend∣ed with a very unusual noise, and with such violence, that at <HI>Welborn</HI> it threw most of the Houses to the ground, brake down some, and tore up other Trees by the Roots, scattering abroad much Corn and Hay, but by Divine Providence only one Boy was killed in that Town: It went thence to <HI>Willingore</HI> the next Town, o∣verthrowing some houses, and killing 2 Children with the fall; it fell so violently on the Church of the next Town to this, that it presently dashed the Spire Steeple to pieces, and rent the Stone and Timberwork of the Church so violently, that but a little of the Wall, and only the Body of the Steeple was left standing; it threw down many Houses, Trees, and out-houses in this Town, as well as in two others far distant: It was observed to move only in a channel or small breadth, and if it had been considerably broader, could not but have ruined a great part of the Country; to some that saw it at a di∣stance before it came near them, it had the appearance
<PB N="139" REF="74"/>
of Fire, and was by some observed to move in a kind of circle, though at the same time it kept its general course along: It passed also through <HI>Nottinghamshire;</HI> some of the Hailstones being measured were 9 Inches about; this Whirl-Wind extended above 60 Yards in breadth; In the Forrest of <HI>Sherwood</HI> it broke down and over∣threw at least 1000 Trees, it brake one short off in the Body which was three Foot in Diameter, it overthrew divers Wind Mills, some Boats in the River, and in one Town consisting of 50 Houses it left but 7 standing: The same Evening over <HI>Derby</HI> Town, and some other places, there appeared a fiery Sword hanging in the Air over them: The <HI>Thursday</HI> after in the Evening there were strange Fires seen hanging over <HI>Nottingham</HI> Town, sinsomuch that some of the Inhabitants coming home∣ward from a Country Market, thought the Town to be on Fire in three several places; these Informations, saith Mr. <HI>Clerk,</HI> I had from Eye-Witnesses worthy of Credit.</P>
<P>About <HI>April</HI> 26. 1661. at <HI>Spalding, Bourne,</HI> and seve∣ral other places in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> it rained Wheat, some grains whereof were very thin and hollow, but others of a more firm substance, and would grind into fine flower, several Pecks of it were taken up out of Church Leads, and other houses that were leaded, several Inhabitants who were Eye-Witnesses brought up a considerable quantity to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Proverb in this Country, <HI>As mad as the bait∣ing Bull of</HI> Stamford, the Original whereof was thus oc∣casioned: <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Warren,</HI> Lord of this Town in the time of King <HI>John,</HI> standing upon the Castle Walls of <HI>Stamford,</HI> saw two Bulls fighting for a Cow in the Meadow, till all the Butchers Dogs great and small pur∣sued one of the Bulls (being mad with noise and multi∣tude) quite through the Town; this sight so pleased the Earl, that he gave all those Fields called the <HI>Castle Mea∣dows,</HI> where first the <HI>Bull-duel</HI> began, for a common to the Butchers of the Town, after the first grass was eaten, upon condition they find a Mad Bull, the day 6 weeks before <HI>Christmas-day,</HI> for the continuance of the sport every year; some think that the men must be as mad as

the Bull, who can take delight in so dangerous a pastime, whereby Gods providence more than mans care is to be observed, that no more mischief is done.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Hussee</HI> was born in this County, he was Lord Chief Justice in the Reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 4. and lived till the time of K. <HI>Henry</HI> 7. In the first Parliament of whose Reign, it happened that many Members were returned, who being formerly his Friends, were at∣tainted by Crookbackt <HI>Richard,</HI> and thereby disabled to sit in Parliament, it being incongruous in the highest de∣gree, that they should make Laws for others, who were themselves outlawed; King <HI>Henry</HI> much concerned here∣at, remitted the Case to the Judges, who all agreed with Sir <HI>Wm. Hussee</HI> upon this grave and safe opinion, mixed with Law and convenience; <HI>That the Knights and Burgesses attainted by course of Law, should forbear to come in∣to the house till a Law were past for reversing their Attainders,</HI> which was done accordingly; when at the same time it was moved incidentally, what should be done for the King himself, who likewise was attainted; the rest unani∣mously agreed with Sir <HI>W. Hussee, That the Crown takes-a∣way all defects and stops in blood, and that by the assumption thereof the Fountain was cleared from all Attainders and Cor∣ruptions.</HI> He died in the 10th of <HI>Henry</HI> 7. <HI>Peregrine Berty</HI> Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> was a very valiant Gentleman, as ap∣pears by his Atchievements both in <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Ne∣therlands</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he could not brook the Flatteries of the Court, and was wont to say, <HI>he was none of those little Animals who could creep on the ground;</HI> the Camp was his proper Element being a great Souldier, and having a suitable magnanimity; when one sent him an insulting challenge whilst he lay sick of the Gout, he returned this answer, <HI>That although he was lame of his Hands and Feet, yet he would meet him with a piece of a Rapier in his Teeth:</HI> He once in a Battle took a <HI>Spanish</HI> Gennet managed for the War, which was in∣tended for a present to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and was desi∣red by a Trumpeter from the General to restore it, of∣fering this Lord a Thousand Pound down for him, or an

<P>The last pitcht Battle in <HI>England</HI> between the two Houses of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> was fought at <HI>Barnet.</HI> 1472. by K. <HI>Edward</HI> 4. who hearing that the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> on the behalf of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 6. was with his Army incamped on a Heath near <HI>Barnet,</HI> he marched to∣ward them upon <HI>April</HI> 13. being <HI>Easter Eve,</HI> and came that evening from <HI>London</HI> thither, where he would not suffer a man of his Army to stay in the Town, but com∣manded them all to the Field, and lodged with his Ar∣my nearer to the Enemy than he was aware, by reason of a thick mist, raised as some say, by Fryar <HI>Bongey</HI> the Conjurer, which made it so dark, that it could not well be observed where they were incamped; In taking his ground he caused his People to keep as much silence as was possible, thereby to keep the Enemy from knowing of their approach, great Artillery they had on both parts, but <HI>Warwick</HI> had more than K. <HI>Edward,</HI> and therefore in the night time they shot continually at the Kings Army, but did little hurt, because they overshot
<PB N="144" REF="78"/>
them as lying nearer than was conceived; on <HI>Easter</HI> day early in the morning both Armies are ordered for Battle; the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> appointed the command of his Right Wing, which consisted of Horse to his Bro∣ther the Marquess <HI>Montacute,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Oxford;</HI> the left Wing likewise consisting of Horse, was led by him∣self, and the Duke of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and the main Battle of Bills, and Bows was conducted by the Duke of <HI>Somerset;</HI> on K. <HI>Edwards</HI> part the Van was commanded by <HI>Richard</HI> D. of <HI>Glocester,</HI> the main Battle (in which the unfortu∣nate K. <HI>Henry</HI> was Prisoner) was led by K. <HI>Edward</HI> him∣self, and the L. <HI>Hastings</HI> brought up the Rear; after ex∣hortations for incouraging their Souldiers, the fight be∣gan, which with great valour was maintained for six hours without any apparent disadvantage on either side, only <HI>Warwicks</HI> Van seemed by the courage of the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to overmatch King <HI>Edwards,</HI> which made some flying toward <HI>London</HI> carry the news, that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> had won the Field, and so perhaps he had in∣deed, but for a strange misfortune which happened to the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> and his men, for they having a Star with streams on their Liveries, as K. <HI>Edwards</HI> men had the Sun, the Earl of <HI>Warwicks</HI> men by reason of the mist, not well distinguishing the badges, shot at the Earl of <HI>Oxfords</HI> men, who were of their own side, whereupon the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> cryed out, <HI>Treason, Treason!</HI> and fled with 800 men; at length after great slaughter made on both sides, K. <HI>Edward</HI> having the greater number of men, caused a new recruit of fresh Souldiers to come on, whom he had reserved to that purpose, which the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> observing, being a man of an invinci∣ble courage, nothing dismayed, rushed into the midst of his Enemies, where he adventured so far, that amongst the press he was struck down and slain; though some write, that seeing the desperate condition of his Army, the Earl leapt on his Horse to fly, and coming to a Wood where was no passage, one of K. <HI>Edwards</HI> men came to him and killed him, and stript him to his naked skin; The Marquess <HI>Montacute</HI> thinking to relieve his Bro∣ther,

lost likewise his life, and left the victory to King <HI>Edward;</HI> There were slain on both sides at least Ten Thousand Men; and hereby King <HI>Edward</HI> again got the Kingdom, and King <HI>Henries</HI> Friends not being afterward able to raise any considerable power on his behalf, he was soon after sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and there murdered by the Duke of <HI>Glocester.</HI></P>

<P>It is recorded that one chief occasion of the <HI>Danes</HI> invading this Kingdom proceeded from the following Accident; About the year 867. one <HI>Lothbrook</HI> a Noble∣man of the Royal Family of <HI>Denmark,</HI> being upon that Shoar, his Hawk in pursuing her Game, fell into the Sea, he to recover her, got into a small Cockboat alone, and by a sudden Tempest was driven with his Hawk to the Coast of <HI>Norfolk</HI> near <HI>Rodham,</HI> where being seized for a Spy, he was sent to <HI>Edmund</HI> K. of the <HI>East Angles,</HI> but having declared his birth and misfortune, the King took affection to him for his skill in Hawking, and his o∣ther good parts, and preferred him, but <HI>Berick</HI> the Kings Falconer envying this favour, as they were hun∣ting together in a Wood, privately murdered him, and hid him in a Bush; <HI>Lothbrook</HI> was soon missed, and by no inquiry could be found, till it pleased God his Dog, which would not forsake his dead Masters Corps, came fawning to the King several times, and then went back to the wood, which the King observing, at length follow∣ed the Hound, who brought him to the place where <HI>Lothbrook</HI> lay; and <HI>Berick</HI> being found guilty of the mur∣der, was sentenced to be put into <HI>Lothbrooks</HI> Boat with∣out Tackle or Sail, as he arrived here; but behold the Event, the Boat returned to the same place in <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> from whence it had been driven for <HI>Berick,</HI> as it were to be punished for this Murther; here the Boat
<PB N="147" REF="79"/>
being known, <HI>Berick</HI> was taken, who to free himself from that bloody Fact, added Treason to Murther, affirming, <HI>That King</HI> Edmund <HI>had put</HI> Lothbrook <HI>to death in</HI> Nor∣folk; In revenge whereof, <HI>Inguar</HI> and <HI>Hubba</HI> the 2 Sons of the murdered <HI>Lothbrook,</HI> being made Generals of a <HI>Danish</HI> Army arrived in <HI>England,</HI> and burnt up the Coun∣try, sparing neither Sex, nor Age, and breaking into <HI>Norfolk,</HI> sent this Message to K. <HI>Edmund, That</HI> Inguar <HI>the most victorious Prince, dreadful both by Sea and Land, having brought divers Countries under his subjection, was now arrived in these parts, where he meant to winter, and requireth thee</HI> Edmund <HI>to be subject, and a vassal to him, to yield up to him thy hid Treasures, and all other the riches of thine Ancestors, and so to reign under him, which if thou refusest to do, he ad∣judges thee unworthy both of life and Kingdom; Edmund</HI> hearing this proud Pagan Message, after advising with his Council, returned this answer; <HI>Go</HI> said he, <HI>and tell thy Lord, that</HI> Edmund <HI>the Christian King for the love of a Temporal life will not submit himself to a Pagan Duke, unless he will resolve to become a Christian;</HI> whereupon <HI>Inguar</HI> and <HI>Hubba,</HI> with their furious <HI>Danes,</HI> pursued the King to <HI>Thetford;</HI> who raising an Army, gave them Battle, but being overpowered by his Enemies, he retired to <HI>Fra∣mingham</HI> Castle, where pitying the terrible slaughter of his People, he submitted himself to the <HI>Danes,</HI> but be∣cause he would not renounce the Christian Religion, these bloody Heathens beat him with sticks, and whipt him with rods; but he still fervently calling upon the name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> they were so inraged, that binding him to a stake, they with their Arrows shot him to death, and cutting off his head, scornfully threw it into an hedg; But his body was afterward honourably buried at St. <HI>Edmundsbury,</HI> from whence that Town had its name.</P>
<P>At <HI>Walsingham</HI> in this County there was a Chappel built in the year 1601. dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and renowned throughout <HI>England</HI> for a Pilgrimage to our <HI>Lady of Walsingham,</HI> and those who did not visit, and present her with offerings, were counted irreligious;

hear the description of <HI>Erasmus,</HI> an Eye-witness, con∣cerning this place; <HI>About four miles from the Sea side,</HI> saith he, <HI>standeth a Town that lives on nothing else almost but the resort of Pilgrims to this place; there is a Colledge of Regular Canons, which hath scarce any other Revenues than from the libe∣rality of this Virgin, for the greater oblations are preserved, but the Mony and other Offerings of smaller value go to the maintenance of the Fryers; the Church is fair and neat, yet the Virgin dwells not therein, that honour</HI> (forsooth) <HI>she hath done to her Son; she hath her Church to her self in the right hand of her Son; neither doth she dwell there for all this, for the building is not yet finished, small light there was in it but by Tapers or Wax-Candles yielding a pleasant smell; and when you come into it, you would say it were an heavenly habitation indeed, so bright shining all over it with precious Stones, and Gold and Silver.</HI> This Chappel with all the Trinkets therein, fell in the general destruction of <HI>Popish</HI> Mona∣steries by K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. At St. <HI>Bennet in the Holm,</HI> there was a great Abby built by <HI>Canutus</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> which was after∣ward so fortified by the Monks with Walls and Bulwarks, that it seemed rather a Castle than a Cloyster, insomuch that K. <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conqueror</HI> could not win it by assault, till a Monk betrayed it into his hands, upon condition he himself should be made Abbot thereof; which was done accordingly; but the King presently hanged up this new Abbot for a Traitor, and so he was justly puni∣shed for his Treachery. K. <HI>Stephen</HI> had only one Son named <HI>Eustace,</HI> a Prince of much blossoming valour, as being cut off at 18 years of Age, some say by drowning, and others by a stranger Accident, but strange Relations must not alwaies be rejected, for though many of them be forged, yet some no doubt are true; and who knows but it may be of this kind which some writers relate of this Prince, <HI>That being at the Abby of</HI> Bury <HI>in the Diocess of</HI> Norwich, <HI>and denyed some money he demanded, he presently in a rage went forth, and set the Cornfields belonging to the Abby on fire, but afterward sitting down to Dinner, at the first morsel of bread he put into his mouth, he fell into a fit of madness, and in that fit dyed;</HI> certainly the Persons of Prin∣ces

<P>In the 11th of K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. there was so great an Earth∣quake in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and some other Counties, that it o∣verthrew many who stood upon their feet, and made the Bells towl in the Steeples. In his 18th Year the Ca∣thedral Church at <HI>Norwich,</HI> with the Houses thereto be∣longing, was burnt, and the Monks dispersed. In the Reign of K. <HI>Richard</HI> 1. a Jew being turned Christian at <HI>Lynn</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> he was persecuted by those of his own Nation, and assaulted in the street; who thereupon fly∣ing to a Church hard by, was followed thither also, and the Church assaulted, which the People of the Town see∣ing, in defence of the new Christian they fell upon the Jews, of whom they slew a great number, and after pil∣laged their Houses; By this Example the Jews were as∣saulted in other places, and vast multitudes of them mas∣sacred, and some of them being blocked up in a Castle at <HI>York,</HI> cut the Throats of their Wives and Children and cast them over the Walls on the Christians Heads, and then burnt the Castle and themselves; neither could this Sedition be stayed, till the King sent his Chancel∣lour, the Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> with force of Arms to punish the offenders. In the 5th of <HI>Hen</HI> 5. a great part of the City of <HI>Norwich</HI> was burnt, and all the Houses of the Fri∣ers Preachers, where two of the Friers themselves were burnt in the flames.</P>
<P>In the 2d of <HI>Edward</HI> 6. 1549 a dangerous Rebellion broke forth in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> about Grievances for <HI>Inclosures;</HI> The Rebels had got one <HI>Ket</HI> a Tanner to be their Lead∣er, who with others encouraged them to pull down In∣closures, and in short time they grew to a Body of 20000, so that the Sheriff of <HI>Norfolk</HI> commanding them in the Kings name to depart, or else he would proclaim them Traitors, he had been certainly slain, had not his Horse been too swift for them; they furnished them∣selves with Arms and Artillery, and for their better se∣curity they fortified themselves upon <HI>Monshold</HI> hill, near

St. <HI>Leonards</HI> hill by <HI>Norwich,</HI> where they carried a face as it were of Justice and Religion; for they had one <HI>Con∣vers</HI> an Idle Fellow for their Chaplain, who morning and evening read solemn Prayers to them, also Sermons they had often; and as for Justice they ordained a Seat of Judgment in an old Tree, whose Canopy was the Cope of Heaven; in this Tree sate the Tanner, as Chancel∣lour and chief Judge, giving out Warrants in the Kings name, and as his Deputy committed many Persons of Quality to Prison, he was assisted by two chosen men of every hundred among them, from whom Commissions were sent to bring in to them Powder, Shot, Victuals, and all things necessary, and here such as had exceeded their Commission were ordered to be imprisoned, so that this Tree was called, <HI>The Oak of Reformation,</HI> whence likewise some Sermons were delivered to the People, and once by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Parker</HI> which had like to have cost him his Life; and now beginning to grow to a height, they presented certain Complaints to the King, requiring he would send an Herald to give them satisfaction; the King, though he took it for a great Indignity to have such base Fellows capitulate with him, yet framing himself to the time, he returned this answer; <HI>That in</HI> October <HI>following he would call a Parlia∣ment wherein their Complaints should he heard, and all their Grievances redressed, requiring the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the mean time to lay down their Arms and return to their houses,</HI> and thereupon granting them a general pardon: But this was so far from satisfying the Seditious, that thereupon they first assaulted the City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> took it, and made the Mayor attend them as their servant, and then returned again to their Station at <HI>Moushold:</HI> Soon after the Mar∣quess of <HI>Northampton,</HI> the L. <HI>Sheffeild,</HI> with several other Lords, 1500 Horse, and a small Band of <HI>Italians</HI> were sent against them, whom the Seditious so stoutly op∣posed, that much mischief was done on both sides, the L. <HI>Sheffeild</HI> falling with his Horse into a Ditch, was taken Prisoner, and as he pulled off his Helmet, to make him∣self known, he was struck down dead by a Butcher; so

that the Marquess with his Forces not prevailing, the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was sent with 6000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, and many other Persons of Quality; When the Earl approached the Camp of the Rebels, he sent a He∣rald offering them the Kings Pardon if they would dis∣band, which they were so far from accepting, that a lewd Boy turned up his naked Breech toward the He∣rald, and bid him kiss it; upon this many skirmishes passed between the Earl and them, with loss sometimes of one side, and sometimes of another, at last they came to a Battle, where the Rebels placed in the Front all the Gentlemen they had taken Prisoners, designing they should first be slain, of whom yet very few were hurt, but of the Rebels above 2000 were killed; and now once a∣gain the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> offered them pardon, but for all their losses they continued obstinate; at last the Earl sent to know if they would entertain their Pardon if he should come in Person, and assure them of it; this mo∣ved them much, and they answered, <HI>That they knew him to be so honourable, that from himself they would embrace it;</HI> whereupon he went to them, and causing their Pardon to be read again, he confirmed it by his words so effectu∣ally, that they all cast away their Arms, and with one voice cried, <HI>God save K.</HI> Edward: The day following <HI>Robert Ket</HI> the Tanner, and Arch-Rebel, was taken, and hanged in Chains upon the Castle of <HI>Norwich;</HI> and <HI>Wil∣liam Ket</HI> the younger, was hanged upon the high Steeple of <HI>Wimondham,</HI> and 9 of the other principal Rebels were hanged upon the <HI>Oak of Reformation;</HI> and thus ended the Sedition in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the day of the defeat of the Re∣bels being a long time after observed as a Festival by the Citizens of <HI>Norwich,</HI> with no less joy than the Jews did when they escaped the sword of wicked <HI>Haman.</HI></P>
<P>In 1578. the 20 of Q. <HI>Elizabeth, Matthew Hamond</HI> of <HI>Hitherset,</HI> 3 miles from <HI>Norwich,</HI> Plow-Wright, for de∣nying Christ to be our Saviour, and publishing divers other horrible Heresies, was convented before the Bi∣shop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> condemned in the Consistory, and de∣livered to the Sheriffs of <HI>Norwich</HI> to be executed; but be∣cause

he had spoken seditious words against the Queen, he was condemned to lose his Ears, which was accord∣ingly executed, and 7 days after he was burnt in the Castle Ditch at <HI>Norwich.</HI> In the 23d Year, <HI>Aug.</HI> 12. there arose a great Tempest of Thunder, Lightening, Whirlwind, and Rain, in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> with Hailstones fashioned like the Rowels of Spurs, two or Three Inches about; it beat the Corn flat to the ground, rent up many great Trees and shivered them to pieces; at <HI>Hemming</HI> a Mile from <HI>Worsted,</HI> the West door of the Church of above 300 pound weight, was lifted off the hooks, and blown over the Font, within a Yard of the Chancel; the top of the Church was ript up, and the Lead blown away; five sheets of Lead were wrapt up to∣gether like a Glove, and blown into a Field without the Church-Yard. In Her 25th Year, <HI>Sept.</HI> 17. <HI>John Lewis</HI> for denying the Godhead of Christ, and holding other detestable Opinions, was burnt at <HI>Norwich.</HI> The 10th of <HI>October</HI> following at <HI>Castor</HI> near <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> a Fish was by the force of the Easterly Winds driven ashoar, the length thereof from the Neck to the Tail was 17 Yards and one Foot; the Head was great, for the Chap of the Jaw was 3 Yards and a quarter in length; with Teeth of 3 quarters of a Yard in Compass; it had great Eyes, with 2 great holes over them to spout Water, her Tail was 14 Foot broad; she was 4 Yards and an half in thick∣ness from the Back to the Belly. In 1656. <HI>July</HI> 20. being <HI>Lords-day,</HI> there was a sudden Tempest in and about <HI>Norwich,</HI> attended with Thunder and Lightning, the flashes whereof were very violent, and the claps of Thun∣der so dreadful, as astonished the hearers; about an hour after many saw a black Cloud like the smoak of a Furnace, which did oftimes cast forth flames of Fire; af∣ter this followed a White Cloud, labouring as it were to overtake the other, but the black Cloud presently co∣vering the City, there arose a sudden Whirlwind, which raised such a Dust in the Streets, that one man could not discern another, and the Clouds still grew thicker, especially in the South-West, out of which there broke

forth terrible Lightnings and Thunder-claps, accompa∣nied with Hail-stones of 5 Inches about, dashing all the Glass Windows to the Wind ward in pieces: In the Country adjoining many Corn-fields were destroyed; Trees were torn up by the Roots; Rabbets and Birds, yea some Sheep, Cows and Horses were killed; the Lightning ran upon the ground, many Houses being fi∣red by it, and more had been consumed, had not an ex∣traordinary shower of Rain quenched them; the Hail∣stones were not round, but flat pieces of Ice: This ac∣count was sent, saith Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> from several credible Persons upon the place. And here must not be forgot∣ten Sir <HI>Robert Venile,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who when the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>English</HI> were ready to give Battle, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, a certain stout Champion of great Stature commonly called <HI>Tournboll,</HI> coming out of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, and challenging any <HI>English-man</HI> to meet him in a single Combate, this Sir <HI>Robert Venile</HI> accepteth the challenge, and marching toward the Champion, and meeting by the way a certain black Mastiff Dog, which waited on the Champion, he suddenly with his Sword cut him off at the loins, and afterward did more to the Cham∣pion himself, cutting his Head off from his Shoulders,</P>

<P><HI>Robert Braybrook,</HI> born at a Village in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> was consecrated Bishop of <HI>London</HI> in the 4th of <HI>Richard</HI> 2. 1381. he was after Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> he died 1404. and was buried under a Marble Stone in the Chap∣pel of St. <HI>Mary</HI> in the Cathedral of St. <HI>Paul, London,</HI> yet was the body of this Bishop lately taken up, and found firm as to skin, hair, joints, nails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for upon that fierce and fatal Fire in <HI>London</HI> 1666. which turned so much of St. <HI>Pauls</HI> into rubbish, when part of the floor fell into St <HI>Faiths,</HI> this dead Person was shaken out of his Tomb, where he had lain, and slept so unchanged, as you have heard no less than 262 years. His body was for a great while exposed to the view of all Persons, many coming daily to see this strange Curiosity. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>Richard Noodvil,</HI> was born at <HI>Grafton</HI> in this County, she was Widdow to Sir <HI>John Gray,</HI> who lost his life for the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and petitioned K. <HI>Edward</HI> 4. to take off the sequestration from her join∣ture; Beauty is a good Solliciter, where youth is to be the Judge; the King fell inamoured of her, and be∣came

a Suitor to her for a nights lodging; and being importunate with her therein, she modestly told him; <HI>That as she did account her self too mean to be his Wife, so she thought her self too worthy to be his Harlot;</HI> The King fin∣ding he could not prevail by wanton love, resolves to marry her, though much to the discontent of his Council, and likewise of his Mother; who among other reasons alledged, <HI>That her being a Widdow might be suffici∣ent to restrain him;</HI> to whom the King replied, <HI>Whereas you say, Madam, that she is a Widdow, and hath already Children, by Gods blessed Lady I am a Batchellor, and have some too, and so each of us have a proof that none of us is like to be barren;</HI> and he accordingly married her, being the first of our Kings since the Conquest, that married his own Subject; yet was his love divided among three o∣ther of his Mistresses, of whom he was wont to say; <HI>The one was the fairest, the other the merriest, and the third the Holiest Harlot in</HI> England, <HI>as being alwaies at her Beads in the Chappel, when he sent for her to his Bed;</HI> His Queen lived to see the death of her Husband, murther of her two Sons, restraint of her self, and the rest of her Children, so that she had more greatness than joy, height than happiness by Marriage; she finished <HI>Queens Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and died not long after.</P>
<P>At <HI>Fotheringay Castle</HI> in this County, was acted the Tragedy of <HI>Mary</HI> Q. of <HI>Scots,</HI> Mother to K. <HI>James,</HI> in the 29 year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> 1587. This <HI>Mary</HI> was the Daughter, and only lawfully begotten Child of <HI>James</HI> 5. and succeeded in her Cradle to the Throne, she was promised in Marriage to King <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. of <HI>England,</HI> but by the power of the <HI>Hamiltons</HI> carried into <HI>France,</HI> and there married to <HI>Francis</HI> 2.

was presently bandying of the Lords of <HI>Scotland</HI> against the Queen Dowager, and each of them sent for Aid; she from <HI>France,</HI> and the Lords from <HI>England;</HI> but this was matter for Consultation; it seemed a bad example for a Prince to give Aid to the Rebellious Subjects of a∣nother Prince; on the other side it seemed no less than Impiety not to give Aid to Protestants of the same Re∣ligion; but most of all it seemed meer madness to suffer enemies to be so near Neighbours, and let the <HI>French</HI> nestle in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who pretend Title to <HI>England;</HI> upon such considerations it was resolved Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> should send them Aid, and thereupon an Army of 6000 Foot, and 1200 Horse were sent under the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and others, who going into <HI>Scotland,</HI> joined with the Lords, where passed many light Skirmishes, many Batteries, and sometimes Assaults, which growing tedi∣ous, soon after ended in a Peace between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>En∣gland,</HI> upon condition, <HI>That neither the King of</HI> France, <HI>nor the Queen of</HI> Scotland <HI>should thence forth use the Arms or Titles of</HI> England <HI>or</HI> Ireland, <HI>and that both the</HI> English <HI>and</HI> French <HI>should depart out of</HI> Scotland; <HI>and a general pardon should pass in Parliament for all that had been Actors in those Stirs;</HI> The Peace was scarce concluded, when <HI>Francis</HI> the young K. of <HI>France</HI> died, and left <HI>Mary</HI> Qu. of <HI>Scots</HI> a Widdow; soon after the House of Commons in Parliament humbly moved Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to Mar∣ry, who answered, <HI>That she was already Married to the Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>and behold,</HI> saith she, <HI>the pledge of the Covenant with my Husband;</HI> and therewith held out her Finger, and shewed the Ring wherewith at her Corona∣tion she gave her self in Wedlock to the Kingdom, <HI>and if,</HI> said she, <HI>I keep my self to this Husband, and take no other, yet I doubt not but God will send you as good Kings as if they were born of me, for as much as we see by dayly experience that the issue of the best Princes do often degenerate, and for my self it will be sufficient that a Marble Stone declare, that a Queen having reigned such a time, lived and dyed a Virgin.</HI> She had indeed many matches propounded to her, to whom she gave Testimonies of her Princely favour, but never

pledges of nuptial Love; about this time the Earl of <HI>Feria,</HI> who had Married the Daughter of Sir <HI>William Dor∣mer,</HI> being denied leave of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for some of his Wives Friends to live in <HI>England,</HI> he grew so inraged, that he persuaded Pope <HI>Pius</HI> 4. to Excommunicate her as an Heretick and Usurper; but the Pope pretending to great gentleness, writ to her lovingly, <HI>To return to the Ʋ∣nity of the Catholick Church;</HI> and made great offers, if she would hearken to his Counsel, particularly, <HI>That he would recall the Sentence against her Mothers Marriage, confirm the Book of Common-Prayer in English, and permit the use of the Sacrament in both kinds,</HI> but the Queen neither terrified with <HI>Feria</HI>'s practices, nor allured with the Popes great offers; according to her Motto, <HI>Semper eadem, always the same,</HI> persisted constant in her resolution to maintain that Religion which in her Conscience she was persua∣ded to be most agreeable to the Word of God, and the practice of the Primitive Church.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Mary</HI> after the death of her Husband went from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and then sent Letters to Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> offering readily to enter into a League with her, so she might by Authority of Parliament be decla∣red her Successor, which was but her Right; to which Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> answered, <HI>That though she would no way dero∣gate from her Right, yet she should be loth to endanger her own security, and as it were to cover her own eyes with a grave cloth while she was alive;</HI> The two Queens were indeed both of great Spirits, <HI>Mary</HI> doubting Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> meant to frustrate her Succession; and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> lest the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> meant to hinder her Succession, which created Jealousies, and many unkind passages between them, as by the sequel appears. The Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> having a desire to Marry again, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> propo∣sed the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> to her, but she Married the Lord <HI>Darnly</HI> Son to the Earl of <HI>Lenox,</HI> and thereupon the next Parliament again move Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to marry, to declare her Successor to the Crown, some of them boldly arguing, <HI>That Princes were bound to design a Successor, and that in not doing it, the Queen would shew her

self no better than a Parricide, and destroyer of her Country:</HI> The Queen was contented to bear with words spoken in Parliament, which out of it she would never have en∣dured, and commanded 30 of each House to appear before her, to whom she said, <HI>That she knew what danger hangeth over a Princes head, when a Successor is once decla∣red; she knew that even Children themselves, out of a hasty desire of bearing Rule, had taken up Arms against their own Father, and how could better be expected from Kindred? And therefore though she had given them leave to debate the matter of Succession, she bid them beware not to be injurious to their Princes patience;</HI> After which they never made any further motion to her; but now the love between the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Darnly</HI> began to cool, and their unkindness was fomented by one <HI>David Risio</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Musician, and afterward the Queens Secreta∣ry, who had often secret conference with her, when the King might not be admitted; this indignity the Lords a∣bout the King made him sensible of, and thereupon his death was contrived, and he was killed in an outer Chamber next the Queen, she being then with Child, and like by the affright to have miscarried; the Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> base Son to K. <HI>James</HI> 5. and base Brother to the Queen, was the chief instigator of this murther, of the foulness of which Fact when the King was sensible, he resolved to be revenged upon <HI>Murray,</HI> who having no∣tice thereof prevented it, with causing the like to be done to him, for soon after the King in a stormy tem∣pestuous night was strangled in his Bed, and then cast forth into the Garden, and the House immediately blown up with Gunpowder; the rumor of this murther being spread abroad common fame laid it upon <HI>Morton</HI> and <HI>Murray,</HI> and their Confederates; <HI>Morton</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> lay it upon the Queen; the King thus murthered, the Queen was advised by them to Marry <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Bothwell</HI> (though he was the man that had acted the Murther) but upon condition that above all things respect might be had to her young Son; and that <HI>Bothwell</HI> might be legally quitted both from the bonds of his former Mar∣riage,
<PB N="159" REF="85"/>
and also of the Kings Murther; hereupon it is plotted that <HI>Bothwell</HI> should be brought to the Bar, and <HI>Morton</HI> being his advocate, by the sentence of the Judg∣es, he is clearly acquitted; and then by consent of some of the Nobility he is Married to the Queen, being first made Duke of <HI>Orkney;</HI> which bred a suspition in many, that the Queen was conscious of the Murther, which was the thing the Confederates aimed at by this Marri∣age, for they by all means increased the suspition, that they might have the better colour against her, and so the very same men who absolved <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and consen∣ted to the Marriage, now take arms against her, as a De∣linquent in both, forcing her Husband to flee, and then seize upon the Queen, whom clad in a very homely garment, they thrust into Prison in <HI>Lochlevyn;</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> hearing of it, sends Sir <HI>Nicholas Throgmorton</HI> to expostulate the matter with them, who alledged <HI>The Queen was subject to no Tribunal under Heaven; That no Judge on Earth might call her in question,</HI> &amp;c. They again opposed the peculiar right of that Kingdom, and used <HI>Buchanans</HI> argument in his Treasonable Dialogue, <HI>That in extraordinary Cases the People have power both to create, and to depose their King;</HI> They then persuaded her to resign the Kingdom, which if she refused to do fairly, they threatned to question her openly for her inconti∣nent living, for the Kings Murther, &amp; for Tyranny, so that through fear She resigned her Kingdom to her young Son <HI>James</HI> at that time scarce thirteen months old, who was five days after anointed and Crowned King; and she constituted <HI>Murray</HI> Vice-Roy during his Minority; soon after some of <HI>Bothwells</HI> Servants were executed for the Kings Murther; who cleared the Queen from being concerned in it.</P>
<P>The Queen having been 11 Months Prisoner, after∣ward made her escape, and raised Forces, which being unexperienced were soon defeated by <HI>Murray;</HI> where∣upon she endeavoured to save her self by flight, and tra∣velled 60 Miles in one day, and contrary to the advice of her Friends went with a few of her Attendants in a

small Bark, and landed at <HI>Wickington</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> send∣ing Letters to Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that having made an escape from her insolent and rebellious Subjects, she was now come into <HI>England,</HI> upon certain hope of her approved Clemency, and therefore humbly desiring that she might be forthwith admitted to her presence; Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> sent her Letters of comfort, and promised her aid &amp; de∣fence according to the equity of her cause, but denied her access, since she was held guilty of many crimes, giving command to have her brought to <HI>Carlile</HI> as a place of more safety: Q. <HI>Mary</HI> then desired she might depart to some other Country, but upon consultation, most were of Opinion to have her detained as one taken by right of War, and not to be dismissed till she had made satisfaction for assuming the Title of <HI>England,</HI> and for the death of <HI>Darnly</HI> her Husband, who was born one of the Queens Subjects: After this many Conspiracies were made to set the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> at Liberty; The Pope sends out his Bull against Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> freeing her Sub∣jects from all Allegiance to her; and the Duke of <HI>Nor∣folk</HI> is beheaded upon her account: These and many o∣ther contrivances and conspiracies seemed very much to indanger the Life of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and tended to the In∣vasion of <HI>England;</HI> whereupon, the better to provide for her safety, a number of her Subjects, the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> being the chief, and others of all ranks and conditions enter into an <HI>Association,</HI> wherein they declare, That since by Her Majesties Life, they and all other Her Ma∣jesties Subjects do enjoy inestimable benefit, they do by this Writing make manifest their duty for the safety of their Sovereign Lady; They then proceed:</P>

Afterward it met with the liberality of divers of the Nobility, Prela∣cy and Gentry; <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> procured a great number of <HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and gave them thereto; <HI>William Laud</HI> A. B. of <HI>Canterbury</HI> bestowed 1300 choice Manuscripts upon it, most of them in the <HI>Oriental</HI> Tongues; at last to compleat this stately and plentiful mansion of the Muses, there was an ac∣cession to it of above 8000 Books, being the Library of that most learned Antiquary Mr. <HI>John Selden.</HI> By the bounty of these noble Benefactors, and many others it is improved in such a manner, that it is a question whe∣ther it be exceeded by any other Library in the world. To this may be added the most Noble Theatre lately e∣rected by Dr. <HI>Gilbert Sheldon</HI> late A.

<P>In the year 1036. <HI>Canutus</HI> the famous <HI>Danish</HI> King dyed, and <HI>Hardiknute</HI> his Son by Queen <HI>Emma,</HI> being then in <HI>Denmark, Harold</HI> his elder, but Bastard Brother, stept into the Throne, for the Nobility meeting at <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> the presence of the one out-weighed the absence of the other; so that they unanimously proclaimed him to be their King, &amp; he was soon after solemnly Crowned at <HI>Oxford</HI> by <HI>Elnothus</HI> A. B. of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> though for some time he seemed unwilling to perform that service; for it is reported, that he having the Regal Crown and Scep∣ter in his possession, he swore he would not consecrate
<PB N="175" REF="94"/>
any other for King, so long as any of Q. <HI>Emma</HI>'s Children were living; <HI>For,</HI> said he, Canutus <HI>committed them to my Trust and Protection, and to them will I give my Faith and Allegiance; this Scepter and Crown therefore I here lay down upon this Altar, neither do I deny, nor deliver them to you, but by Apostolick authority I require all Bishops that none of them presume to take the same away; neither therewith to consecrate you for King, as for your self you may if you dare, usurp that which I have committed to God on this his Table:</HI> But not∣withstanding these thundring words were soon allayed with golden showers of Promises of his future just and religious Government, though they were soon forgot; but he did not long enjoy his Usurpation, dying 4 years after and was buried at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>In 1258. a Parliament was called at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to recon∣cile the differences between K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. and his Barons; where the Lords and Bishops propounded several Ar∣ticles to the King, as, <HI>That he should faithfully keep and ob∣serve the Charter of Liberties which he had so often sworn to; That none should be Judges but those who would judge accord∣ing to right, without respect to poor or rich,</HI> &amp;c. Then they again renewed their Confederacy, solemnly swearing, <HI>That neither for life nor death, nor love, nor hate, they would not be drawn to relent in their purpose, till they had cleared</HI> England, <HI>in which themselves and their Forefathers were born, from Ʋpstarts and Aliens, and had procured laudable Statutes;</HI> Yea these turbulent Nobles went farther, and it was con∣trived by the Bishops, saith M. <HI>VVestminst. That</HI> 24 <HI>per∣sons should be chosen to have the whole Administration of the Kingdom, and to appoint yearly all Officers, reserving only to the King the highest places in publick Meetings, and saluta∣tions of honour in publick Places:</HI> And to inforce these Ar∣ticles they were strongly armed, and provided with Forces, so that the King and Prince <HI>Edward</HI> were com∣pelled to swear to these <HI>Oxford</HI> Provisions, as they were called, for fear of perpetual Imprisonment, the Lords having published a Proclamation, <HI>That whosoever resisted them should be put to death:</HI> Then the Peers and Prelates rook their Corporal Oaths to be true to the King, and
<PB N="176" REF="95"/>
that they would all stand to the Trial of their Peers; the Lords soon after required <HI>VVilliam de Valence</HI> the Kings half-Brother to deliver up a Castle to them; which he swearing he would not do, the E. of <HI>Leicester</HI> and the rest answered, <HI>That they would either have his Castle or his Head;</HI> The People seemed wholly theirs, which so heightened the Barons, that when <HI>Henry</HI> Son to the King of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmain</HI> refused the confederacy, or to take the Oath without his Fathers consent, they boldly told him, <HI>That if his Father himself did not hold with the Baronage of</HI> England, <HI>he should not have a furrow of Earth among them;</HI> These hot proceedings made all the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> about the King run from <HI>Oxford</HI> into <HI>France;</HI> yea <HI>Richard</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Kings Brother, coming to see the King and his Coun∣trey, the Barons grew suspicious of him, and therefore required him to take the following Oath: <HI>Hear all men,</HI> I Richard <HI>E. of</HI> Cornwall <HI>swear upon the holy Gospels to be faithful and forward to reform with you the Kingdom of</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>hitherto by the counsel of wicked men too much deform∣ed; and I will be an effectual coadjutor to expel the Rebels and Troublers of the Realm from out of the same: This Oath will I ob∣serve upon pain to forfeit all the Lands I have in</HI> England. These proceedings were too hot to hold; for a while af∣ter the Earls of <HI>Leicester</HI> and <HI>Glocester,</HI> two of the chiefest Confederates, falling at debate among themselves, the King took the advantage thereof, and in a little time re∣covered his former Power and Authority: But from hence we may observe that the <HI>Popish</HI> Nobility, Clergy nor Laity, have not at all times been so very Loyal to their Princes, as they would now make the ignorant be∣lieve.

<P>In 1400. a Conspiracy was contrived against K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. in the first Year of his Reign, in the house of the Ab∣bot of <HI>Westminster,</HI> who was a kind of a Book-Statesman, but better read in the Politicks of <HI>Aristotle</HI> than <HI>Solomon,</HI> who remembring some words of K. <HI>Henry</HI> when he was
<PB N="177" REF="95"/>
only Earl of <HI>Derby; That Princes had too little and Religi∣ous men too much;</HI> and fearing lest now being King he should put his words into Act, he thought it better to use preventing Physick before hand, than to stand to the hazard of curing it afterward; and thereupon invited to his House several discontented Lords, as the Duke of <HI>Exeter,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Surrey,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Aumerle</HI> E. of <HI>Sa∣lisbury,</HI> E. of <HI>Glocester,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Carlile, Maudlin,</HI> one of K. <HI>Richard</HI> 2. Chaplains, and several other Knights and Gentlemen, who after Dinner conferring together, and communicating their disaffections to each other against K. <HI>Henry;</HI> they resolved at last to take away his Life, and contrived this way to do it; They would publish a solemn Justs or Turnament to be held at <HI>Oxford</HI> at a day appointed, to which the King was to be invited to honour it with his presence, and there while all men were intent upon the sport, they would have him mur∣thered. This Plot was resolved on, Oaths of secrecy were taken, and solemn Indentures for performing the agreed conditions were signed, sealed and delivered: The Justs are proclaimed, the King is invited, and pro∣miseth to come, secrecy on all hands is kept most firm∣ly to the very day: But though all other kept Counsel yet Providence would not; for it happened that as the Duke of <HI>Aumerle</HI> was riding to the Lords at <HI>Oxford</HI> against the day appointed, he took it in his way to go visit his Father the Duke of <HI>York;</HI> and having in his bosom the Indenture of Conspiracy, his Father as they sate at din∣ner chanced to spy it, and asked what it was; to whom his Son answering, <HI>It was nothing that any way concerned him;</HI> By St. George (saith the Father) <HI>but I will see it,</HI> and therewithal snatching it from him read it; and then with great fierceness spake thus to him: <HI>I see Traitor that idleness hath made thee so wanton and mutinous, that thou play∣est with thy Faith and Allegiance as Children do with sticks; thou hast been once already faithless to</HI> K. Richard 2. <HI>&amp; now again art false to K.</HI> Henry, <HI>and art never quiet; thou knowest that in open Parliament I became Surety and Pledge for thy Allegi∣ance both in Body and Goods; and can neither thy Duty nor my

Desert restrain thee from seeking my destruction? In faith but I will rather help forward thine;</HI> And commanding his Horses to be made ready, he with all speed rid to the King to <HI>Windsor;</HI> but his Son knowing his danger rid in∣stantly another way, and came to the Court before him, where locking the Gates, and taking the Keys from the Porter, pretending some special reason, he went up to the King, and falling on his Knees asked his Pardon, the King demanding for what Offence, he then discovered the whole Plot; which he had scarce done when his Father came rapping at the Court Gates, and coming to the King shewed him the Indenture of Confederacy which he had taken from his Son: This amazed the King, and thereupon laying aside the seeing of the Just∣ing of others in jest, takes care that he be not justled out of the Throne in earnest: In the mean time the confe∣derate Lords being ready at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and hearing nothing of the Duke of <HI>Aumerle,</HI> nor seeing any preparation for the Kings coming, they were certainly persuaded their Treason was discovered, upon which considering their case was desperate, they apparel <HI>Magdalen,</HI> who was like K. <HI>Richard</HI> 2. in Royal Robes, and published that he was escaped out of Prison; next they dispatch Mes∣sengers to require assistance from the King of <HI>France,</HI> and then set forward against K. <HI>Henry</HI> at <HI>Windsor;</HI> but he be∣ing gone to <HI>London</HI> they could not agree what measures to take, and coming to <HI>Cicester</HI> the Bailiff of the Town couragiously set upon them, and with the assistance of the Townsmen beat their forces, killing the Duke of <HI>Sur∣rey</HI> and the E. of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and taking divers Prisoners; a∣bove 30 Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, with <HI>Magda∣len</HI> the Counterfeit being sent to <HI>Oxford</HI> to the King, and there executed. About this time also a strange piece of Treason is reported to have been practised against King <HI>Henry</HI>'s Life, that there was found in his Bed-cloaths an Iron with three sharp spikes standing upright, that when the King should lie down he might thrust himself upon them: Thus ended this Treasonable attempt, soon after which followed the cruel murder of K. <HI>Richard</HI> 2. in <HI>Pomfract</HI> Castle.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="96"/>In the Reign of K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. 1541. This ridiculous ac∣cident happened, as it is related by Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> which shews what disorders may fall out through errour and mistake; There was one Mr. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llary</HI> Master of Arts in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who for opinions contrary to the <HI>Romish</HI> Church was convented before the Bishops, and then sent to <HI>Oxford,</HI> there openly to recant, and carry a Faggot, to the terrour of the Students of that University: The next <HI>Sunday</HI> he was brought into St. <HI>Marys</HI> Church, many Doctors, Divines, and Citizens being present; Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> preached the Recantation Sermon, and Mr. <HI>Mallery</HI> stood before him with his Faggot; about the midst of the Sermon there was suddenly heard in the Church the voice of one crying <HI>Fire, Fire,</HI> in the Streets; occasion∣ed by one that came by and saw a Chimney a fire in <HI>Al∣hallows</HI> Parish, and so passing by the Church, cried <HI>Fire,</HI> thinking no hurt, this sound of fire being heard in the Church, went from one to another, till at length it came to the Ears both of the Doctors and Preacher himself, who amazed with sudden fear, began to look up to the top and Walls of the Church, which others seeing look up also; then began some in the midst of the crowd to cry out, <HI>Fire, Fire,</HI> where saith one, and ano∣ther, In the Church says one, the Church was scarce pronounced, when in a moment there was a great cry, <HI>The Church is afire, the Church is afire by Hereticks:</HI> Then was there such horrour and confusion as cannot be ex∣prest, which raised such a Dust as seemed like Smoak indeed; this and the outcries of the People made them all so afraid, that leaving the Sermon they began all to run away; but such was the press of the multitude crowd∣ing together, that the more they laboured the less they could get out; for they stuck so fast in the door that there was no moving forward nor backward; they ran to another little Wicket on the North side, and from thence to another door on the West; but there was so great a throng, that with the force thereof the great Bar of Iron, which is almost incredible to speak, was pulled out and broken with the strength of mens hands,
<PB N="180" REF="97"/>
and yet could not the door be opened for the vast con∣course of People: At last being past hope of getting out, they in great amazement ran up and down, crying out, <HI>That the Hereticks had conspired their death:</HI> One said he plainly heard the Fire, another affirmed he saw it, and a third swore he felt the melted Lead dropping down upon his Head and Shoulders; none made more noise than the Doctor that preached, who first of all cried out in the Pulpit, <HI>These are the subtleties of the Hereticks a∣gainst me, Lord have mercy upon me, Lord,</HI> &amp;c. In all this consternation nothing was more feared than the melting of the Lead, which many affirmed they felt dropping on their Bodies: The Doctors finding Authority and force could not prevail, fell to Intreaties, one offering 20 pound, another his Scarlet Gown, so that any man would pull him out though it were by the Ears: A Pre∣sident of a Colledge pulling a Board out from the Pews, covered his Head and Shoulders therewith against the scalding Lead, which they feared much more than the falling of the Church; one thought to get out at a Win∣dow, and had broken the Glass, and got his Head and one Shoulder out, but then stuck fast between the Iron Bars, that he could move neither way; others stuck as fast in the doors, over the heads of whom some got out: A Boy was got up to the top of the Church door, and seeing a Monk, who had got upon the Heads of men, coming toward him, with a great wide cowl hanging at his Back, the Boy thought it a good opportunity to make his escape, and handsomely conveyed himself into the Monks cowl; the Monk got out with the Boy in his cowl, and for a while felt no weight nor burden, but at last feeling his cowl heavier than ordinary, and hearing a voice behind him, he was more afraid than while in the throng, verily believing that the Evil Spirit which had set the Church on Fire had flown into his cowl, whereupon he began to play the Conjurer; saying, <HI>In the name of God, and all Saints I command thee to declare what thou art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at art behind my Back; I am</HI> Bertrams <HI>Boy,</HI> said the other, <HI>But I,</HI> said the Monk, <HI>adjure thee in the name

of the inseparable T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ity, that thou wicked Spirit do tell me who thou art, and from whence thou comest, and that thou go hence: I am</HI> Bertrams <HI>Boy,</HI> said he, <HI>and I pray good Ma∣ster let me go:</HI> When the Monk perceived the matter he took the Boy out, who ran away as fast as he could; In the mean time those without the Church seeing all things safe, made signs to them within to be quiet; but the noise being so great that no word could be heard, these signs increased their fear, supposing all the Church on fire without, and that they were bid to tarry within, and not to venture out, because of the dropping of the Leads, and the fall of other things; this trouble lasted many hours, but at length the mistake was discovered; the next day and Week following there was an incre∣dible number of Bills set upon the Church doors to en∣quire for things lost, as Shoes, Gowns, Caps, Purses, Girdles, Swords and Money, for in this hurry there were few but through negligence or forgetfulness left something behind: The poor Heretick who by this di∣sturbance had not done his sufficient Pennance, per∣formed the rest of it the next day at the Church of St. <HI>Frideswide.</HI></P>

K. <HI>Henry</HI> 4. was made sensible that a Crown can hardly sit easy upon the head, if it be not set right on at first, for now a new conspiracy was hatched against him, the <HI>Piercies</HI> Earls of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> with <HI>Henry Hotspur</HI> began at this time to fall off from K. <HI>Henry,</HI> because at their request he denied to redeem their Kinsman <HI>Mortimer</HI> from <HI>Glendours</HI> slavery; &amp; that he denied them the benefit of such Prisoners as they had taken of the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Hamilden,</HI> whereupon they themselves procured <HI>Mortimers</HI> delivery, and then entred into a League Of∣fensive and Defensive with <HI>Glendour,</HI> whereby they a∣greed to divide the Kingdom into three parts between them, wherein <HI>Glendour</HI> persuaded them they should ful∣fill a Prophecy, as though K. <HI>Henry</HI> were the Mouldwarp cursed of Gods own mouth, and they were the Lyon, the Dragon, and the Wolf who should divide the Land among them; all <HI>England</HI> from the <HI>Severn</HI> to <HI>Trent</HI> South and Eastward was to be the portion of the Earl of <HI>March;</HI> all <HI>Wales</HI> and the Lands beyond <HI>Severn</HI> West∣ward to be <HI>Owen Glendours,</HI> and all the remainder of the

<P><HI>That King</HI> Henry <HI>had falsified his Oath given at his lan∣ding, swearing that he came only to recover his Inheritance, and would not meddle with the King or Crown; That most Traitorously he had taken Arms against his Soveraign Lord King</HI> Richard 2. <HI>had Imprisoned him, and then most bar∣barously caused him to be murdered, and without any Title or Right had procured himself to be made, and crowned King; That ever since the Murder of King</HI> Richard <HI>he had unjustly kept the Kingdom and Crown from his Cousen</HI> Edmund Mor∣timer <HI>Earl of</HI> March <HI>to whom of night it belonged; That when no want compelled him he had imposed divers subsidies and Taxes upon the People to their great grief, of which they would willingly, but durst not complain; That no Justice could be expected from him, since contrary to his Coronation Oath he had by Letters sent into divers Counties, procured such Parliament Men to be chosen, as upon occasion might serve his turn; And lastly, that whereas for Affinities sake he ought to have ranso∣med his Cosen the Earl of</HI> March <HI>from his strait and loath∣some Imprisonment, he not only denied it, but falsely and untruly published, that he became a voluntary Prisoner; for all which and many other causes, they utterly defied</HI> Henry <HI>as a Traytor and Ʋsurper, and as an Enemy vowed his destruction, and the restoring the said Earl to his Right.</HI> K. <HI>Henry</HI> could not but know that all these Articles against him were true, yet since this knowledge did not hinder him from seek∣ing the Crown when he had it not; it would less hinder: him from seeking to keep it now he he had it; and if
<PB N="188" REF="101"/>
he were able, being a private man to get it from a King, he was likely to be more able being now a King to keep it from private Men; and as for any objections of Con∣science he could answer them all by this, That if his Title were good against King <HI>Richard</HI> by his resignation, it was good against <HI>Mortimer</HI> by his swearing Allegiance; and upon these grounds, with a mind as confident as if all Circumstances were on his side, he raised an Army, and marched toward the Lords, taking care they might by no means join with the <HI>Welch,</HI> and in <HI>Battlefield</HI> near <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> he encountred them, in which Fight though the <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Henry Hotspur</HI> shewed mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> valour, yet the Victory rested on the Kings side, <HI>Hotsp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r</HI> being slain, the Earl of <HI>Worcester</HI> taken Prisoner, with several others; On the Kings part the L. <HI>Stafford</HI> who that day revolted to him, and nine who were that morning Knighted were slain, and 1600 common Soldiers, but of the Conspira∣tors above 6000; The King was once unhorsed by <HI>Dow∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss,</HI> who in his presence slew <HI>Sir Walter Blunt,</HI> who was that day attired in all things like the King; <HI>Dowglas</HI> be∣ing afterward taken Prisoner by the fall of his Horse, was by the Kings Command for his valour set at liberty without ransom; In this Battel the young Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> though wounded in the face with an Arrow, lost not his Courage, but continued fighting still; After this Victory the King caused publick thanks to be given, and then ordered the Earl of <HI>Worcester</HI> to be beheaded, and ma∣ny others to be hanged, drawn and quartered; after which he sent Prince <HI>Henry</HI> into <HI>Wales</HI> with his whole Army, but before his coming all <HI>Owen Glendours</HI> Army forsook him, so that lurking in the Woods for fear of being taken he was there miserably famished: Many of his Associates were taken and put to death, and thus in the fourth year of his Reign all the great troubles of this K. <HI>Henry</HI> ended.</P>

<P>In this County K. <HI>Arthur</HI> was buried; for being mur∣dered by <HI>Mordred,</HI> at <HI>Cambula</HI> near <HI>Tintagel Castle</HI> in <HI>Cornwall</HI> as is aforementioned, he was carried from thence to <HI>Glastenbury</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> and was there buri∣ed in 542. and 600 years after was found and taken up on this occasion; King <HI>Henry</HI> 2. in the last year of his Reign being at <HI>Pembroke,</HI> chanced to hear certain Songs in praise of the worthy Acts of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> sung by a <HI>Welch</HI> Bard or Poet, to his Harp, wherein it is mentioned, that he was buried in <HI>Glastenbury</HI> Church-yard between two Pillars there standing; whereupon King <HI>Henry</HI> cau∣sed the ground to be digged, and at seven foot deep was found a huge broad Stone, whereon was fastened a lea∣den Cross; on the lower side of the Lead in rude and barbarous Characters was written, <HI>Hic jacet,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Here lies King</HI> Arthur <HI>buried in the Vale of</HI> Avelona; And digging nine foot deeper his Body was found in the Trunk of a Tree, the bones very large, and in his skull were per∣ceived ten wounds, one very great and plain; His Queen <HI>Guenever</HI> a Lady of excellent beauty, lay by him, whose Hair curiously plaited, and of a golden colour shewed perfect and whole till touched, but then it fell to ashes. The Cross of Lead with the Inscription was taken off,

and kept in <HI>Glastenbury</HI> Church, and the bones of King <HI>Arthur</HI> were put into a fair Tomb of Marble, and his Queen laid at his feet in the same Church; but were all raced at the general suppression of Abbies by <HI>Henry</HI> 8th.</P>
<P>In the 22. of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> 1580. a strange Appa∣rition happened in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> 60 Parsonages all clo∣thed in black, a furlongs distance from those that beheld them, who continued some time and then vanished; and immediately another strange company in like man∣ner, number and colour appeared in the same place, and encountred each other, and then vanished; and the 3d time appeared that number again all in bright Armour, and encountred one another, and so vanished away; This was examined before Sir <HI>George Norton,</HI> and swore by four honest men, that saw it, to be true; In Her 38th year <HI>Dec.</HI> 5 being <HI>Sunday,</HI> a great number of People being Assembled in the Cathedral Church of <HI>Wells</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> in the fore-noon during Sermon, a sudden darkness fell among them, and a great Tempest with Thunder and Lightning followed, which threw the People on the ground, and all the Church seemed to be in a flame, and there was a lothsome stink, some Stones were stricken out of the Bell Tower, and the wires and Iron of the Clock melted; the Tempest being over, and the people recovering their senses, some of them were found marked with strange Figures on their Bodies, and their Garments not perished, neither were any marked who stood in the Chancel. In <HI>January</HI> 1648. there was seen a great fiery Meteor in the Air near <HI>Bristol</HI> on the South side of the City for divers nights together, long in shape, and shooting out fiery streams East and West; this happened saith Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> a week before the death of K. <HI>Charles</HI> 1. and I had it from an Eye witness. In <HI>August</HI> 1655. a Carpenter living at <HI>Pennard</HI> in this County, went to a Fair at <HI>Lidford</HI> not many miles off to set up some Stalls; and left his Wife and four small Children at home; but at his return he found all his four Children murthered, (the eldest being

<P><HI>Wockey hole</HI> in <HI>Mendip</HI> Hills near two miles from <HI>Wells</HI> is very remarkable; It is an underground concavity, admirable for its spacious Vaults, stony Walls, and creeping Labyrinths.

<P><HI>John Courcy,</HI> Baron of <HI>Stoke-Courcy</HI> in this County was the first <HI>Englishman</HI> who subdued <HI>Ʋlster</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and therefore deservedly created Earl thereof; He was after∣ward surprized by <HI>Hugh Lacy</HI> (Corrival for his Title) sent over into <HI>England,</HI> and imprisoned by King <HI>John</HI> in the <HI>Tower;</HI> after this a <HI>French</HI> Castle being in controver∣sy, was to have the Title thereof tryed by Combate, the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> beholding it; <HI>Courcy</HI> who was of a lean lank body with staring Eyes, is sent for out of the <HI>Tower</HI> to undertake the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and because weakned by Imprisonment, a large allowance of Victuals is given him to recruit his strength; The Mon∣sieur who was to fight with him, hearing how much he eat and drank, and guessing at his courage by his sto∣mach, took him for a Canibal who would devour him, and was therefore afraid to encounter him; Afterward the two Kings being desirous to see some proofs of <HI>Cour∣cies</HI> strength, caused a steel Helmet to be laid on a block before him; <HI>Courcy</HI> looking about him with a stern and grim Countenance, as if he intended to cut it with his Eyes as well as with his Arms, cut the Helmet in two pieces at one blow, striking his Sword so deep into the
<PB N="194" REF="105"/>
wood also, that none but himself could pull it out again; Being demanded the cause why he looked so sternly, he replied, <HI>Had I failed of my purpose, I would have killed the two Kings, and all the rest in the place,</HI> words well spoken because well taken, saith Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> all Persons present being then highly in good humor. He died in <HI>France</HI> 1210.</P>

The Commodities of this County consist chiefly in Corn, Cattle, Alabaster, Wood, Iron, Pitcoal and Fish, where∣of the River <HI>Trent</HI> is very full; <HI>Stafford</HI> Town was built by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Elder, incorporated by King <HI>John; Litchfield</HI> is far greater, &amp; of much more fame, it is a very ancient City known to Reverend <HI>Bede</HI> by the name of <HI>Lichidfield,</HI> that is, <HI>The Field of dead Bodies,</HI> by reason of the number of Christians there Martyred in the bloody Persecution of <HI>Dioclesian;</HI> The City is low seated, of a good largeness and Fair withal, divided into two parts by a shallow Pool of clear water, which are joined by two Bridges made over them, having sluces to let out the water; the South part is the greater, consisting of di∣vers Streets, having in it a School, and an Hospital of St. <HI>John,</HI> founded for the relief of the Poor; The farther part is the less, but beautified with a goodly Cathedral Church, which is incompassed with a very fair Wall like a Castle, this Church mounteth up on high with three Pyramids or Spires of Stone, making an excellent shew, and for elegant and proportionable building yieldeth to few Cathedrals in <HI>England,</HI> but by the late confusions it was much defaced.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="105"/>In the 35th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> 1591. there was a great Tempest in <HI>Staffordshire</HI> whereby the shaft of the Steeple in <HI>Stafford</HI> Town was rent in pieces all along through the middle, and thrown upon the Church, wherewith the roof was so shattered, that a 1000 pound would not repair it; Many Houses and Barns were over∣thrown in divers places in that Shire; In <HI>Cauck Wood</HI> a∣bove 3000 Trees were blown down, and likewise more than 50 Steeples; soon after there was a strong North∣wind, and a very great rain which continued 24 hours. In 1662. <HI>July</HI> 30. between two and three a clock in the afternoon there happened a great storm at <HI>Eardly</HI> in this County, accompanied with Thunder, which made such a continual strange noise in the Air, that it struck a ter∣ror into all that heard it, of which there was no inter∣mission for a long time; also there fell a shower of Hailstones as big as Hens Eggs, some 5, 6, and 7 Inches about: I my self, saith the Relator, measured one after the Storm was over, and a good part of it melted, yet then it was five inches about; There was a Gentleman who measured some of them by a good big Watch, and they were full as big as it; within half a mile of this place the Hailstones lay upon the ground a quarter of a yard thick; there was a Man getting in a Load of Hay, and his Horses, as well as all others, would not be ruled, but ran about as mad, which forced the man to continue in the storm, and his back, shoulders and arms were black and blew with the Hail; it did much hurt to the Barley, and struck it out of the Ear as if threshed; it beat down other Corn as it stood on the ground all to pieces, it also killed abundance of Fowl, Sheep, and Lambs; some of the Hailstones tasted Salt, like <HI>Sal Prunella,</HI> and were kept long after without be∣ing at all wasted; The people were very much amazed, and the continual strange noise in the Air was very ter∣rible to them.</P>
<P>In the year 1669 <HI>July</HI> 31. There was a great dark cloud seen to arise in the East not far from <HI>Litchfield,</HI> which drawing nearer to the City, came over it about

noon, and then appeared to be a huge number of Ant∣flies, so thick that they darkned the Sky; and it being Market day there, they fell down in great abundance, so that they filled the very Houses; The People both within and without doors were much bitten or stung with them, yea the very Horses were so disturbed with them, that they ran about as if wild; The Market Peo∣ple were so plagued with them; that they were forced to pack up and be gone; People were driven out of the Field from their Harvest work, and thus they continued 2 or 3 hours, multitudes of them falling dead, and lying so thick in the Streets, that whole handfuls of them might be taken up and the People swept them in heaps; The remainder took their flight Northward, and mo∣lested other places; This was attested saith Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> by many Eyewitnesses.</P>

<P><HI>Thomas Cromwell</HI> was born at <HI>Putney</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> his Fa∣ther was a Blacksmith, and therefore could bestow no great matter on his Education, yet such was his wit and activity, that he made his own Fortune; He was in the service of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> after whose death he is recommended to K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. who finding the quickness of his understanding advised with him in many diffi∣cult matters, and upon occasion he informed the King how his Princely Authority was abused by the Pope and his Clergy, who being sworn to him, were afterward dispensed with and sworn anew to the Pope, so that he was but half a King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He also shewed him, that the Clergy by their Oath were fallen into a <HI>Premunire,</HI> and their Goods, Lands, Chattels and Possessions were fallen to the King; which he afterward demonstrated to the Bishops to be true, who gave the King above an hun∣dred thousand pound for Composition; after this by his persuasion the King suppressed all the Abbies and Mona∣steries in <HI>England,</HI> and commanded the Bible to be Printed and read in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, and the Bishop of <HI>Romes</HI> Power was by several Statutes abolished in <HI>England;</HI> howeuer divers of the <HI>Popish</HI> Bishops and Clergy privately endeavoured to restore it again, which he was alwaies aware of, and therefore calling his Ser∣vants together, he discovered to them in what a slippe∣ry condition he stood, considering the variable affections of the King, and the malice and subtlety of his <HI>Popish</HI> Adversaries, and therefore required them to be very circumspect, least by their default any quarrel might be pickt against him; and soon after some false witnesses accused him of Heresy, and of speaking some words a∣gainst the King; yet his Enemies durst not bring him to his answer, nor try him by his Peers, but procured an

Hearse was forsaken of all men, every one running to quench the Fire; That done, they return and carry the Corps to the Church; The Funeral Sermon being en∣ded, and the stone Coffin set in the Earth in the Chan∣cel, as the body was ready to he laid therein, there stood up one <HI>Anselm,</HI> and forbid the Burial, alledging, that that very place was the floor of his Fathers House, which this dead King had violently taken from him to build this Church upon, <HI>Therefore,</HI> said he, I <HI>challenge this ground, and in the name of God forbid, that the Body of this Oppressor and dispoyler be covered with the Earth of mine Inheritance;;</HI> They were therefore forced to compound with him for an hundred pounds; now was the body to be laid in that stone Coffin, but the Tomb proved too little for the Corps, so that pressing it down to gain an entrance, the Belly not bowelled, brake, and sent forth such an intolerable stink among the Assistants at the Funeral, that all the Gums and Spices suming in their Censers could not relieve them, but all in great amaze∣ment hastened away, leaving only a Monk or two to shuffle up the Burial, which they performed with all possible hast, and so got to their Cells; yet was not this the last of those Troubles that the Corps of this great Prince met with, but some years after at such time as <HI>Caen</HI> was taken by the <HI>French,</HI> his Tomb was rifled, his bones thrown out, and some of them by private Sol∣diers brought as far as <HI>England</HI> again, so that if we con∣sider his many troubles in life, and after his death, we may well think that notwithstanding all his greatness, a very mean man could hardly be persuaded to change Fortunes with him.

whereon is a very great Arch; The West part is incom∣passed with a very fair Wall, and the River together foursquare, having an entrance only at one Gate, from which a long and broad street reacheth to the very Bridge, which is beautified with handsome Houses, with Gardens and Orchards on the back, and pleasant Fields behind; On the East side the Houses stand very thick, and the streets are narrower, being fortified with a strong wall, and is divided on the South-East with the deep Channel of the muddy River <HI>Fosse,</HI> which entring into the heart of the City by a blind way hath a Bridge over it with Houses built upon it, and so close ranged one by another, that it seems rather a street than a Bridge, and soon after runs into the <HI>Ouse,</HI> where a stately Castle formerly stood, which commanded the whole City, but it is now gone to decay; toward the North stands the Cathedral Church, an excellent, fair and stately Fabrick.</P>
<P>We read that <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> after he had setled himself in this Kingdom, did much a bridge the power of the prelates in Temporals, ordaining that they should exercise no Temporal Authority at all; but yet in Spiri∣tuals he rather raised them, as appears by a passage be∣tween <HI>Aldred</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> and this King; for one time upon denying a certain suit, the Archbishop in great discontent offered to go away, but the King for fear of his displeasure staid him, and fell down at his feet, desiring his pardon, and promising to grant his Suit, the King for sometime lay at his fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and the Noble∣men that were present put the Prelate in mind that he should cause the King to rise; <HI>Nay,</HI> said the Archbishop, <HI>let him alone, let him find what it is to anger St.</HI> Peter. And as by this story we may see the insulting Pride of this Prelate in those days, so by another we may observe the equivocating falshood of another Prelate at that time, for <HI>Stigand</HI> A.

who being accused of Simony, and denying it, the Cardinal before whom he was to answer, told him. <HI>That a Bishoprick was the gift of the Holy Ghost, and therefore to buy a Bishoprick was against the Holy Ghost,</HI> and thereupon bid him say, <HI>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,</HI> which the Bishop beginning, and oft trying to do, saith our Historian, could never say, <HI>and to the Holy Ghost,</HI> but said it plainly when he was put out of his Bishoprick.</P>

On the top of a hill called <HI>Mynd-Morgan</HI> is a Monu∣ment with a strange character, which the Inhabitants thereabout say, if any man read the same, he will dye shortly after, whereby I suppose they mean, that it is impossible to be read; There is a Lake in <HI>Merionethshire</HI> near <HI>Bala,</HI> containing near 160 Acres of ground, into which the River <HI>Dee</HI> runs, and goes through it without mixing their Waters; This <HI>Pemble-Meer</HI> doth not swell with all the Waters and Land-floods which fall from the Mountains unto it, but a small blast of Wind will make it mount above its bounds and Banks.

<P><HI>Malcolm</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> was a very magnificent and couragious Prince in 1067. of which he gave proof in the beginning of his Reign, for being informed of a Conspiracy against his life, he dis∣sembled the knowing of it, till being abroad one day a hunting, he took one of the chief Conspirators aside, challenged him as a Traitor, adding; <HI>Here now is a fit place to do that manfully, which you intended to perform by Treachery; now if you have any valour, kill me honourably, and none being present you can incur no danger.</HI> With this Speech of the King, the man was so daunted, that he fell at his Feet, confessed his fault, asked forgiveness, and proved ever after Faithful and Loyal. This King repealed that barbarous Statute of K. <HI>Eugenius</HI> 3 by the persuasion of his Virtuous Lady <HI>Margret,</HI> Sister to K. <HI>Edward Atheling,</HI> which ordained, <HI>That when a man was married, his Lord should lye with his Bride the first night;</HI> He al∣lowing it to be redeemed with half a Mark of Silver, which sum is to this day put into the Leases which the Lords make to their Vas∣sals; this King besieging <HI>Aldwich</HI> Castle, an <HI>English</HI> Knight unar∣med, only with a light Spear in his hand, on the end of which he carried the Keys of the Castle, came riding into the Camp, where being brought to the King, and bowing his Spear, as though he intended to present him with the Keys, ran him into the left Eye, and left him for dead, and by the swiftness of his Horse escaped; hence some say came the great Family of the <HI>Pierceys;</HI> His Queen hearing of her Husband and Sons death, beseeched the Almighty that she might not survive them, and had her desire, dying within a days after.</P>

Mother of <HI>Scotland</HI> having received aid from <HI>France,</HI> forced the Protestants for a while to retire toward the Highlands, whereupon she scoffingly said, <HI>Where is now their God, my God is stronger than theirs even in</HI> Fife; but her boasting lasted not long, for within a few days 600 Protestants beat above 4000 <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots;</HI> This same Qu. Mother, when some <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> attempted to take <HI>Leith</HI> by Storm, and many of them were slain, because the Scaling Ladders were too short, beholding the slaughter from <HI>Edenburgh</HI> Castle, she burst forth into a great Laughter, saying, <HI>Now will I go to Mass, and praise God for what mine Eyes have seen;</HI> And when the <HI>French</HI> had stripped the flain, and laid the naked bodies along the Walls, the Queen looking on them, jeeringly said; <HI>Yonder are the fairest Tapestries that ever mine Eyes beheld, I wish that all the Fields which are between</HI> Leith <HI>and this place were all strewed with the same Stuff;</HI> But her Joy was very short, for presently after a Fire kindled in <HI>Leith,</HI> which burnt up all her Store-houses aad Provisions for her Army, and the Queen Mother for grief fell sick and died.

<P>The Earl of <HI>Kildare</HI> being charged before K. <HI>Henry</HI> 7. for burning the Cathedral of <HI>Cassiles,</HI> &amp; many witnesses rea∣dy to prove it, he suddenly confessed it to be true, to the great surprize of the Council wondring how he would justify it; By Jesus, <HI>saith he, I would never have done it, if it had not been told me the Archbishop was within it,</HI> and because the Bishop was one of the chief Accusers, the K. laughed at the plainness of the man, to hear him alledge that fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> excuse, which did chiefly aggravate his Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Ireland</HI> is divided into 4 Provinces, <HI>Monster, Lemner, Cor∣naught,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ʋlster,</HI> wherein are 33 Counties; <HI>Dublin</HI> is the Me∣tropolis, seated on the River <HI>Liffie,</HI> in which is an Uni∣versity; It hath 4 Archbish &amp; 19 Bish.</P>
