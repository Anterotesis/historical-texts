autority of which two graue authors
together with mine owne opinion cō∣curring
with their iudgement in this
point, caused me a long time to for∣beare
the publishing of this Epitome
of mine. But on the other side when
I considered, first that the subiect of
this booke containeth matter of state
and gouernment, which as saith <HI>A∣ristotle
Eth.</HI> 2. <HI>Principatum tenet
in omnibus artibus.</HI> Secondarilie,
that I shoulde but fight vnder the

thirdly; that the originall published

esteemed as a pearle of pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reles price.

I began to conceiue well of my tra∣uaile,
and to hope that the wise and
learned allowing so well of the booke
at large, woulde not disallow of my
paines in the abbreuiation therof. At
the least thus much I am well assured
of, that if I haue failed in the publi∣shing:
yet haue I not erred in the apt
adressing and dedication thereof, ha∣uing
(with all humility) presented it
to the protection of your most Hono∣rable
name, being as all forraine na∣tions
confesse the greatest politique
of this age, and as all England with
great ioye acknowledgeth, the sole
piller and onely <HI>Atlas</HI> as it were vn∣der
hir most excellent Maiesty of this
most flourishing common wealth, &amp;
lastly in regard of mine owne parti∣cular
the onely patron to whome I
owe euen by discent a peculiar hande
of all dewty and deuotion. Wherfore
<PB REF="4"/>
as I hope that the world wil pardon
the former fault (if it be any) in con∣sideratiō
of the amends that is made
thereof by the later fact: so doubt I
not but that your Honorable L. ac∣cording
to your accustomed clemency
will accept of this my poore endeuour
and protect this my attempt, with
the shield of your honorable autho∣ritie
and iudgement: whereby your
L. shall not onely stop the mouthes of
barking Mastifes, who thinke other
mens reprofes their owne praise, but
also thereby greatly increase the pri∣uate
band of my dewtie and seruice.
And thus no whit doubting but that
your L. will pardon my breuitie,
which I haue the rather vsed to the
end my Epistle may be answerable as
wel to your L. leasure as to the worke
it selfe beeing but an Epitome, most

to 30. And of Latitude, iust 4. degrees: namely,
from 50. to 54. the which space, allowing halfe
an hower for a Clymat, maketh the artificial day
to differ about three quarters of an howre.</P>
<P>The middle of the Contrey is <HI>Andwerp,</HI> which
standeth in the Longitude of 26. degrees, and
42 minuts, &amp; in the Latitude of 51. degrees and
a halfe, so that the highest that the Sun moūteth

when it entreth into the other, bicause it riseth
and setteth very perpendicularly.</P>
<P>The Countrey is seated very commodiouslie
for all the Prouinces of <HI>Europe:</HI> for Northwarde
it is but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> daies iourney by Sea from <HI>Den¦marke.</HI>
Southward, it confineth with <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Lorraine.</HI> Eastward, with <HI>Almayne.</HI> Westward,
with <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> It is also
commodious for <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Sweden:</HI> for a Ship
that depar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d out of <HI>Holland,</HI> arriued in <HI>Norway</HI>

and lesse, and out of Spayne in eight, ten, twelue,
or fifteene, according to the Hauen where you

<P>The circuit of the Countrey is about the fifte
par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Italie,</HI> and somewhat more: namelye, a∣bout
a thousand Italian miles, or 340 Flemishe

<P>The Leagues of the Countrey are of two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts,
the one Flemish, the other French. The Flemish

are greater, and yet greater in a great parte of
<HI>Guelderland,</HI> and in <HI>Frisland</HI> they are as great as
the Almayne leagues: namely, fiue or six Italian
miles long and better. The French leagues con∣taine
two Italian miles, and these are vsed all o∣uer
<HI>Flanders, Gallicante, Artoys,</HI> and the greatest
part of <HI>Haynault.</HI></P>
<P>In that part of <HI>Belgique</HI> that obeyeth K. Phi∣lip,

<P>Townes priuiledged as walled townes 150.</P>
<P>Villages with Parish churches, aboue 6300.</P>
<P>Besides a great number of other villages, &amp; ham¦lets,

strong places with garisons and particular Go∣uernours.</P>
<P>The Ayre within these 25. or 30. yeares is be∣come
much more holsome and temperate then
it was in times past: whether it bee by reason of
the great increase of the Inhabitantes, or of the
industrie of the people, whoe purge it sundrye
waies, or of some other superiour cause, I knowe
not.</P>
<P>The Countrey though it be not very propiti∣ous

singularly well qualified, hath a wonderfull rare
Garden.</P>
<P>The Beeues of <HI>Friseland</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are ve∣ry

lambs at a time, and the Kyne often two Calues

the which discharge themselues into the

Ha, Ems,</HI> besides diuers other, which shall bee
described hereafter in order.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rhine</HI> riseth out of the Mount <HI>Adula,</HI>
(commonly called the Mountaine of S. <HI>Gedart,</HI>)
with two fountaines. And out of the same moun∣taine
rise also, the Riuers of <HI>Rosne, Tesin,</HI> &amp; <HI>Rus.</HI>
So that within the Compasse of lesse than ten I∣talian
miles, you shall see (not without great ad∣miration)
foure famous Riuers to arise, the which
in the forme of a Crosse, take their waies and
course diuerslie, toward the foure partes of the
world.</P>
<P>The two Fountaines of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> vnite them
selues togither, foure leagues aboue the Cyttye
of <HI>Cur</HI> in <HI>Swisserland.</HI> But at <HI>Lobie</HI> in <HI>Guelder∣land,</HI>
the <HI>Rhine</HI> parteth it selfe againe into two
streames, the greater of the which, namely, the
left streame, taketh his course to the West, and
from thenceforth is called <HI>Wael.</HI> With the which
at <HI>Heruerden</HI> meeteth the <HI>Meuse,</HI> and sudden∣ly
they part againe, neither riuer losing his name:
and in this sort take their course apart, till they
come to <HI>Louuestain,</HI> where again they ioyne,
and there the <HI>Wael</HI> loseth his name, as in the de∣scription
of the <HI>Meuse</HI> shall be declared more
at large.</P>
<P>The lesser branch of the <HI>Rhine:</HI> namely the
right, neere to <HI>Arnem</HI> in <HI>Guelderland,</HI> diuideth it
<PB REF="11"/>
selfe againe in twaine. The one of the which
namely, that on the right hand, runneth a small

but of the cōmon sort <HI>New Ysel,</HI> bicause <HI>Drusus

there ioyned with the Riuer <HI>Ysel,</HI> to conuey ther

into the Septentrionall Sea. This Fosse beeyng
ioyned with <HI>Ysel,</HI> at <HI>Campen</HI> entereth into the
Gulfe of <HI>Zuiderzee:</HI> And you shall vnderstande
that the sayd Riuer <HI>Ysel,</HI> before it meeteth with
these waters of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is called olde <HI>Yssel,</HI> but
after their meeting, they are both named Newe
<HI>Yssel:</HI> bicause of the great increase of their wa∣ters.
And thus the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which before that time
had but two branches, is now deuided into three
namely, the <HI>Wael,</HI> which wee haue already des∣cribed:
this heere now described called <HI>Yssel,</HI> &amp;

<P>The right branch of the Riuer of <HI>Rhine:</HI> after

<HI>Leck,</HI> and leauing his olde course which was by
<HI>Vtrecht, Voerden</HI> and <HI>Leyden,</HI> into the Ocean
Sea, by reason that extreame tempests had stop∣ped

which retaineth the ancient name of <HI>Rhine,</HI> and

<HI>Catwick,</HI> and the Fort <HI>Britannique,</HI> where was in

<HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Meuse</HI> riseth in the mount <HI>Ʋogesus,</HI> not
farre from the fountaines of the twoe noble Ri∣uers,
<HI>Seine</HI> and <HI>Marne.</HI> At <HI>Heruerden,</HI> it mee∣teth
with the <HI>Wael,</HI> and suddenly they disioyne
againe, neyther riuer losing his name, and so a∣part
each taketh his course to <HI>Louuestaine,</HI> wher
<PB REF="12"/>
(hauing first made the little Isle of <HI>Bomler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI>)
they ioyn togither again, &amp; so ioyntly taking the
name of <HI>Merwe,</HI> they come to <HI>Dordrecht,</HI> where
(hauing made the Ile of <HI>Iselmont</HI>) the <HI>Meuse</HI> re∣sumeth
his name, and with such a furie entereth
the Sea, that it maintaineth his course &amp; keepeth
his water fresh a great space, not without great
cōmoditie and profit to the country, for by that
meanes it openeth the waie to diuers fishes, es∣peciallie
to sturgeons, the which findinge in the
Sea this sweete water, and being beyond mea∣sure
desirous thereof, enter so farre there into, that
in the ende comming into the shallowe waters,
they become a pray to those that lie in waight
for them. The like effect worke also the riuers,
of <HI>Pau, Tibre, Rosne, Garonne,</HI> and euerie other
Riuer that entereth the Sea with a violent course
But the <HI>Seine, Hebre,</HI> and the <HI>Thamis,</HI> entering
gentlie into the Sea, soone lose both their course
and their fresh water, and therefore worke no
such effect as the <HI>Meuse</HI> and the other Riuers
aboue mentioned do.</P>
<P>The Sturgeous of <HI>Meuse</HI> are so great, that
some of them waigh foure hundred, and some
foure hundred and twenty pound, &amp; are twelue
foote longe of <HI>Andwerp</HI> measure, which is as

<P>The time that the Sturgeon is in season, be∣ginneth

<P>Besides sturgeons the <HI>Meuse</HI> veeldeth also

diuers streames, but principally where the course
of the Riuer is largest and deepest: It deuydeth
these Iles into two principall parts: namely, East

<PB REF="13" MS="y"/>
which is aboue 30. leagues frō the mouth of the

<P>Into this Riuer, by reason of the vicinity that it

the Sea diuers sorts of fishes: namlye, Sturgeons,
Salmons, and Salmon-trouts, Lamprayes, Tur∣bots,
Congers, Shads, Mulets. Viues, Soles, &amp;c.
Besides a number of other sorts of fishes that run
into this Riuer out of the Sea, as well to feede as
to spawne (so commodious is the water for that
purpose) in such sort, that by the space of two or
three moneths in the Spring and in Summer (be∣sides
the great fish) such a deale of yoong frie is
taken in this Riuer, that an infinite number of

<P>Into this Riuer run also out of the Sea, the dog
fish or Sea-calfe, and the excellent Porpeses, cal¦led
in Latine <HI>Tursii,</HI> which two kindes of Fishe
spawne not, but ingender as land Beastes, and
bring forth their yoong perfect and accomplish∣ed.

<P>There are also at <HI>Andwerp</HI> besides these Marts,
two great Horse faires: the one at Whitsontide,
the other at our Lady day in September, &amp; like∣wise
two of Leather and skins of all sorts, which

<P>The second cause of the wealth of <HI>Andwerp</HI> is
this. In the year 1503. the Portugales began to
bring spices out of their Indias, and from <HI>Calicut</HI>
into <HI>Portugale,</HI> &amp; frō thence to <HI>Andwerp,</HI> which
before that time were wont to be broght by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed sea to <HI>Barnt</HI> &amp; thense to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> &amp; so to
<HI>Venice,</HI> which (before the Portugals voiage into
the Indias) furnished all Christendome ofspices.
But the king of Portugale, hauing partly by loue,
partly by force, drawne all the traffique of spices
in <HI>Calicut</HI> and the Iles adiacent thervnto into his
owne hands, and hauing brought them to <HI>Lis∣bonne,</HI>
sent his factor with spice to <HI>Andwerp,</HI>
by which meanes it drewe all Nations thyther
<PB REF="33"/>
to buy spices of the said Factor. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
by this occasion beginning to be greatly freque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted:
Afterward in the yeare 1516. diuers Mar∣chants

from <HI>Bruges</HI> to go and dwell at <HI>Andwerp,</HI> &amp;
after them others, and so by little and little all
strangers (a few excepted) left <HI>Bruges</HI> and went
to <HI>Andwerp,</HI> with no lesse commodity to this dit∣tie,
than discommodity to that.</P>
<P>The third cause of the wealth of <HI>Andwerp,</HI> was
the course that Monsieur <HI>de Longueuale</HI> &amp; Mar∣tin
<HI>van Rossem</HI> made with a mightie armie, An.

to haue spoiled <HI>Andwerp:</HI> by occasion whereof
the Cittizens of <HI>Audwerp</HI> to auoid the like peryll
herafter, haue since y<SUP>e</SUP> time maruelously fortified
their towne, for the safetie both of it &amp; of al Mar∣chants
traffiking to it: so that it is now free from

whereof, a great multitude of Noblemen and
