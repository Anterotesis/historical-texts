<L>WIth a sowre aspect, and a Critick eye</L>
<L>I have perus'd, thy well writ Tragedie;</L>
<L>My ravisht soul, grew sicker then the Age</L>

<L>As dreaming men, sometimes, do thinke upon</L>
<L>Who when they wake, are wroth and vexed sore</L>
<L>They of that sweet delusion taste no more.</L>
<L>I wisht thy Play had been more largely writ</L>
<L>Or I had ne're seene, or perused it.</L>
<L>In which <HI>Apollo,</HI> and the three times three</L>
<L>Sweet <HI>Thespian</HI> Ladies, chaunt (though dolefully)</L>
<L>Such stately layes, that famous <HI>Sophocles</HI></L>
<L>Would write his Plaies a new, saw he but these:</L>
<L><HI>Melpomene,</HI> girt in a purple Robe</L>
<L>Her hand in Heaven, her foot upon Earths Globe</L>
<L>Is taught by thee, to chaunt forth Tragick notes</L>
<L>Such as do damn the Rebels and their Votes.</L>
<L>He that can read thy Play, and yet forbear</L>
<L>For his late Murthered Lord, to shed a tear,</L>
<L>Hath an heart fram'd of <HI>Adamant</HI> and may</L>

So the Athenians courted thirty Tyrants to be the Par∣tie that should gall their heart-strings; and the fond Sy∣racusians laboured sore to have the <HI>Dionisii</HI> be their Consuls: Was ever any Nation bless'd with so good a Prince (as CHARLES our King) that so opprobriously deserted Him? succeeding Ages cannot chuse but say,</P>

<PB N="20" REF="15"/>my Master, I have led on with hopes of re-establishment so long, that now He doubts my feign'd reallity; and a strong Partie in the Junto sit, who without me, are now in Treatie with Him, but I shall breake the necke of their Designe (perhaps) before they thinke it, the severall Commanders of the Army are now all of my Faction, while <HI>Fairfax</HI> (silly Foole) sits like a Statue, as if he nothing knew, or nothing durst, I have propo∣sed unto the severall Officers to forsake the King, and yeild Him up (as one not fit to live) unto the block; I have informed them, (and it takes exceedingly, so for∣ward are the Fooles to worke my ends and their owne certaine ruine) that the King is a Man of bloud, by no meanes to be trusted, being of a rigid and implacable Spirit, hating (even to the death) all have opposed Him, and that should He regaine his former Power, He quick∣ly would make use on't to their ruine, that therefore they should make a retreat in time, nor yeild their necks unto a Tyrants mercy, that they having declar'd so highly for Him, might the more easily (by farre) entrap Him; nor was it a discredit so to doe, since in all Ages such a poli∣tick course hath been thought just and safe: they (sna∣red with my words) resolve to doe so, for to remove the King by violent death, and to set up a Military Power; now my plots worke, the Stage growes great with hor∣ror, the English Monarchy growes sick to death, its very Basis hath an Ague-fit, which wil not cease to shake it, till it be Levell'd to the humble earth.</P>

<P>Renowned Generall, under whose con∣duct we have been fortunate and victorious, I need not now recite, since you well know what vast expence of bloud, of toyle, and treasure, we have been at since we besieg'd this Towne, the third part of our Army quite consum'd by the immured Enemies frequent Sallies, by our unfruitfull Onsets, and hard Duty, and how mercy∣lesse
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>they have shewn themselves to those (of ours) whom Fortune gave them Prisoners; all which considered, I doe give my vote (and justice speaks the same) that <HI>Ca∣pel, Goring, Lucas,</HI> and stout <HI>Lisle,</HI> die without mercy, even that very day which we receive the Towne.</P>
