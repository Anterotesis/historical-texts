<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is commonly said a∣mong Gamesters, that the Standers by oft-times see more than the persons themselves that play.</P>
<P>The like may be said, as to the Writing of Books: That the Critical
<PB REF="4"/>
Reader soon discovers the Errors and Defects of the Writer.</P>
<P>Withall, it is a com∣mon Observation, even of the Vulgar and Inferior sort of the People of <HI>France</HI>; that when any Stranger chanceth to trip or falter, either in the Pro∣nunciation, or <HI>Idiom</HI> of their Language, they, instead of laughing at their failings, are still ready to help them out,
<PB REF="4"/>
and inform them bet∣ter.</P>
<P>In our present Affair therefore, there is no more to do, than to wish the good fortune of falling in∣to the hands of the most courteous and best natu∣red of Readers; and in∣deed, there is a kind of ne∣cessity for it: for, in treat∣ing of the <HI>Productions, Manufactures, Inventi∣ons,</HI> and other things herein contained, there
<PB REF="5"/>
is (if not more) at least, as much need of Con∣verse, as of Books; of consulting the Living, as the Dead.</P>
<P>Whatever then, through haste, Inadvertency, or want of convenient Assis∣tance; either of Mistake, or Omission of what is most Curious or Remark∣able (I say, most Curious or Remarkable; since a too particular, and Minute Account would swell each
<PB REF="5"/>
Head into a distinct Vo∣lume) may have escaped in this present Work; those Gentlemen who shall think it worth their while, and will give themselves the trouble, are humbly desired, against the next Impression, if the VVork shall be thought worthy of it, to impart their Advice and Informations.</P>
<P>Small Beginnings oft times grow up to conside∣rable Improvements: and

a little Cottage may be inlarged to a Commodi∣ous, if not stately Habi∣tation.</P>

<HEAD>THE Present State OF ENGLAND. PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Island of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the largest of the <HI>European</HI> Islands, and to very few Islands of the World inferiour in bigness, to none in Fertility, Power, Good Government and the Glory of its great Actions, lies between 52 and 58 degrees of <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude. <HI>England</HI> the noblest and largest part thereof, and a distinct King∣dom of it self, though at present united un∣der
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
one Monarch, hath undergone four se∣veral grand Revolutions. Not to mention the <HI>Samotheans, Albionists,</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> his <HI>Trojan</HI> Dynastie, whose credit depends ra∣ther upon fabulous Tradition than real Hi∣story, the ancient Inhabitants of this Island are scarce taken notice of by any Author of account but by the name of <HI>Britains</HI>; and the first certainly known Attaque that ever was made upon them, was by the <HI>Romans,</HI> under <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>; and after that several others by the Lieutenants of several suc∣ceeding Emperors, not without a World of Bloodshed: The Natives no less stoutly resisting, than the <HI>Romans</HI> furious assaul∣ting, till at length they gain'd a no less quiet than perhaps advantageous Possession among us; I mean, advantageous to this Island; so that the Losers may be said to have been the greatest Gainers, the Con∣quered the greatest Triumphers: For if we consider, from the several Descriptions that have been written thereof, what bar∣barous and absurd Customs the Ancient <HI>Britains</HI> had among them; we may con∣clude that Civility and Arts were so much the earlier introduced by the coming in of the <HI>Romans</HI>; who also by their long Habi∣tation here, and Familiar Converse with the Old Inhabitants, were of Foreigners
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
become as it were Natives, of Enemies Protectors, insomuch that when they were call'd away for the Defence of their Pro∣vinces Abroad, their Departure was no less regretted, than their Arrival was op∣pos'd.</P>
<P>The next Attempters upon this part of the Island were the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who being at first Invited in for their Assistance against the Invading <HI>Picts</HI> and other Borderers, became at length themselves the greatest Invaders; and playing upon the Easie and Luxurious Temper of the Prince that first Incourag'd their coming over, they got a Footing, which by continued fresh Supplies sent over from time to time, they made so sure, that all the Force the <HI>Britains</HI> were able to make against them for several Ages, was not able to unfix it. For notwith∣standing this great Opposition, in which several of the <HI>British</HI> Kings Signaliz'd them∣selves, even to the Fame of Heroes, espe∣cially the Great King <HI>Arthur,</HI> whose Glory nothing hath so much Eclips'd, as that his Actions (great enough in their Truth) are blown up into Storys, so Romantick and and Surpassing all Credit, maugre I say all the Force could be Mustered against them: They still Increased in Number and Strength, till in the end the <HI>Britains</HI> quite
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
tir'd out, were glad to retire into the Moun∣tainous and remote parts of the Land, (by which they kept themselves for many Ages a people intirely distinct, and their Lan∣guage to this very day unmixt; the Root of ours being evidently the <HI>Saxon,</HI> so that the other must needs be the Ancient <HI>British</HI>) and leave all the rest to be shar'd among the new Possessors, who, there be∣ing so many Proprietors in the Conquest, dealt out the <HI>British</HI> Monarchy into seven Parcels; which sevenfold Partition it may well be wondred how it could keep up so long, considering the Confusions, and as it were Civil Wars, that arose (as how could they but arise) among so many Petty Monarchs upon one Continent (that is, as to the bounds of each Kingdom) till at length one swallowing up the other, the stronger the weaker, this Seven-headed <HI>Hydra</HI> of Government came to a Period, and one bright face of Monarchy shot up again, and spread its Lustre over all this better part of <HI>Britain,</HI> which hath ever since been called the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and hath so continued, with little or no Interruption, from the Raign of the Great <HI>Egbert.</HI> He it was who first reduc'd this Heptarchy into a Perfect Monarchy, though it was tending toward it sometime
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
before, even to this day; and from him the <HI>Aera</HI> of our <HI>English</HI> Monarchies by Historians and Chronologers are reputed to commence: So that from the said <HI>Eg∣bert,</HI> his present Majesty that now Happily Reigns, is reckon'd the fourty sixth sole Monarch of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But scarce was this Government well setled, when the expected Tranquility thereof was disturbed by a new Generation of Invaders, more Barbarous and Mischiev∣ous, than ever any either before or since; Committers of far greater Outrages and Cruelties: Yet so often either driven out, or totally extirpated; so often bravely Conquered in the Field by the high Va∣lour and Conduct of several of our <HI>English Saxon</HI> Monarchs (whose Fame stands great in History to this day for their Vertue and Gallantry, both in Peace and War) that it may well be wondred, how any one Coun∣try could spare such Multitudes of People, as continually pour'd in upon us for se∣veral Ages together; and how such nu∣merous Forces could make such frequent Landings with so little Opposition: But then it must be considered, that we had no <HI>Summer</HI> Guards Abroad, no Squadrons of First, Second and Third Rate Frigats to Cruise about and Guard the <HI>English</HI> Coasts;
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
what kind of Ships there were in those either for War or Trade, cannot be col∣lected from any Account or Description we find recorded or publish'd; but thus much may well be concluded, that the best Man of War of those times was far Inferior to the meanest Merchant-Man now adays. For the space of about 174 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from 833, to 1017. was this poor King∣dom harrass'd by the continual Invasions of these <HI>Northern</HI> Pirates; yet could they not in all this space catch hold of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> till the said year 1017. and then they held it no longer than du∣ring the Reign of three Kings; after which it reverted again to the <HI>Saxon</HI> Line.</P>
<P>The Fourth and last Invasion was that of the <HI>Normans,</HI> if he can properly be call'd an Invader, who seems to have come in with the Consent, at least if not Invitation of several of the Nobility and Prelacy; for else doubtless his claim could not have been so easily decided by the dint of one Battle, and he so readily have had the Crown put on his Head by <HI>Aldred</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> who with several other Bishops and Noble∣men, met him upon the way, and pay'd him their Allegiance; and from this <HI>Nor∣man</HI> Conqueror the Monarchy of <HI>England</HI> hath been kept up in a continued, though
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
not Lineal Succession to this day. Among the Prae-eminences which this Kingdom hath above all the other Kingdoms of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> the chiefest and which most redounds to its Glory, is, that it was first Enlightned with the Knowledge of True Religion; so that whatsoever place it may claim in <HI>Europe,</HI> it deserves at least to be esteemed the first Kingdom of <HI>Christendom</HI>: And admit that <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> were not the first that Preached the Gospel here, though there are not wanting Testimonies, to make it out, not altogether contemp∣tible: However, it is most certain, that the Christian Religion here, is of a much elder date, than the coming over of <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk; that is, even in the very Apostles time, by the Testimony of <HI>Gildas</HI>; and as it appears by the mention of a Noble <HI>British</HI> Lady, <HI>Claudia Rufina,</HI> in one of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles; and it was not much above 100 years after e're it was own'd by publick Authority: For the first Chri∣stian King mention'd in History, is our <HI>British</HI> King <HI>Lucius,</HI> who was Contempo∣rary with the Emperor <HI>Commodus,</HI> also the first Christian Emperor, at least the first that publickly Profess'd, Protected and Maintain'd the Christian Faith, (for before him <HI>Philippus Arabs</HI> is said to have been a
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
a Christian, and Baptiz'd) was <HI>Constantine</HI> Surnamed the Great, a <HI>Britain</HI> Born, the Son of <HI>Constantius Chlorus</HI> (who also was a Favourer of the Christians, and died at <HI>York</HI>) by the Daughter of King <HI>Coilus He∣lena</HI> (a Princess most renowned for her Christian Piety, and for being the Inven∣tress of the Cross. And as this Nation boasts Antiquity equal with <HI>Rome</HI> it self, for the Dawning of the Gospel's Light among us, so it claims a Prerogative of Lighting the first Lamp of Reformation to the Christian World; and highly glories in this, that there is no where to be found so excellent and moderate an Establishment of Church-Government among all the Re∣formed Churches.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>The Riches of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Nation.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">And first of the Arable Pasture and Fruitage.</HEAD>
<P>THe Riches of any Nation, I mean the Native and Inland Riches, (for by Imported Commodities, the Barrenest Na∣tion in the World may be Rich,) consist chiefly in the Arable, the Pasturage, the Fruits, and other Plants of peculiar Use and Advantage. The Rich Veins of Earth for Mettals and other sorts of Minerals, and the Plenty of Fish and Fowl; all which things are both profitable in them∣selves, and for the Manufactures they produce; and though common to this Na∣tion, with the greatest part of the Earth in general, yet it will not be from the pur∣pose to discover how far the <HI>English</HI> Nati∣on excels in each of them, and what parts of the Nation are most peculiarly fam'd and commended for this or that Producti∣on. As to the Arable, it would be in vain to particularize any one part of <HI>England</HI> more
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
than another, since so great Plenty of all sorts of Corn and Grain is produced in all parts of this Nation. Nevertheless, it is worth the observing, how some Counties are more peculiarly celebrated for this or that Grain: I have heard it affirm'd, that the very best Wheat in <HI>England</HI> is from a Vale near <HI>Hessen</HI> in <HI>Middlesex,</HI> lying <HI>South∣ward</HI> of <HI>Harrow on the Hill</HI>; however a∣mong the four W's of <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> Wheat is one, the other three being Wool, Wood and Water. Moreover for <HI>Oates,</HI> if there be any where one sort better than another, the best Oats are said to be in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and in greater abundance than any other County; and for Barly and Malt, <HI>Bedford∣shire</HI> hath among some a particular men∣tion. Moreover, for what is said in gene∣ral of some places above others: It is suf∣ficiently considerable which is reported of the Town of <HI>Godmanchester</HI> in <HI>Huntington∣shire,</HI> in reference to the great Name that Town hath for Tillage, and its Prae-emi∣nence above all the Towns of <HI>England</HI>; besides for number of Stout and Able Husbandmen, namely that the Inhabi∣tans of this Place us'd in former times to meet the Kings of <HI>England</HI> as they pass'd this way in their Progress, in a kind of Ru∣ral Pomp and Pageantry of show, with no
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
fewer than 180 Ploughs; and in this manner King <HI>James</HI> at his first coming to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> was received in his Journey from <HI>Scotland,</HI> with 70 Team of Horses, fitted with all their Furniture to as many New Ploughs; the King expres∣sing much Delight and Satisfaction at so Brave and Happy a Sight, and highly ap∣plauded the Industry and well deserved Prosperity of the people of that Place. Remarkable also is the Vale of <HI>Evesham</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> so called of one <HI>Eoves</HI> a Swinheard to <HI>Egwin</HI> Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> so Renowned for its Fertility and excellent kind of Corn it yields, that it is called the Granary of those parts. The Vale of <HI>Alisbury</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> is also parti∣cularly taken notice of for its Pleasant Meadows and Rich Pastures. Nor are the Sheep-Pastures near <HI>Knetworth</HI> in <HI>Hart∣fordshire,</HI> which is called the Garden of <HI>England,</HI> to be forgotten. <HI>Portholm</HI> Mea∣dow also in <HI>Huntingtonshire</HI> is reckon'd among the <HI>Notabilia</HI> of that County. The like may be said in a great measure of the Pasturage: However there are some places so peculiarly remark'd either for the Large∣ness or Richness of their Pastures, that the mention of them cannot well be omitted. The Isle of <HI>Shepey</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> being about 21
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
Miles in compass, is without question so denominated from the numerous Flocks of Sheep which it feedeth. No less celebra∣ted is <HI>Rumny-Marsh,</HI> heretofore a part of the Sea, under the Name of <HI>Romanum Mare,</HI> which by common Speech is easily corrupted into <HI>Rumnense Marshium:</HI> Of this <HI>Marsh, Twine</HI> in his Commentary, <HI>De rebus Anglicis,</HI> making a particular men∣tion, thus concludes, <HI>Denique unde tot pingues peeudes,</HI> &amp;c. Lastly, saith he, <HI>Whence so many Fat Cattle come to the Sham∣bles, that not only all</HI> Kent <HI>is largely sup∣plied from this place, but even the City of</HI> London <HI>also, in some measure fares the better.</HI> In the <HI>Marsh-Country</HI> of <HI>Norfolk</HI> common∣ly called <HI>Marsh-Land</HI>; the Soyl is so very Mellow and Fruitful, that in a certain large Mead called <HI>Tilneysmeth,</HI> there are said generally to feed no less than 30000 Sheep at a time. <HI>Wormleighton</HI> in <HI>War∣wickshire,</HI> breeds Sheep of so large a size, that there are scarce the like to be seen elsewhere. <HI>Lemster</HI> upon the River <HI>Lug</HI> in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> feeds a Breed of Sheep which yields so Fine and Delicate a Wool, that our Noble Poet <HI>Draiton</HI> in his <HI>Polyol∣bion,</HI> compares it to the Wool of <HI>Apulia</HI> and <HI>Tarentum,</HI> which hath been always ac∣counted the Finest Wool of <HI>Europe.</HI> The
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Bread also of <HI>Lemster</HI> is no less noted by reason of the Fineness of its Flower, inso∣much that <HI>Lemster</HI> Bread and <HI>Weably</HI> Ale are united into a Proverb, as <HI>Leigh</HI> ob∣serves in his Description of <HI>England.</HI> Like∣wise the Sheep of <HI>Cotswold (i. e.</HI> a place of Sheep-Cotes or Folds upon a Hill) in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> yield so Fine a Wool, that nothing but the <HI>Spanish</HI> Wool can outvy it, and this advantage it owes to a Present that was made by King <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> to <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> very much to the prejudice of <HI>England,</HI> as it hath since proved. <HI>So∣merton</HI> once the chief Town, as some say, of <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> and gave the denomination to the Shire, consists almost wholly, with the Country thereabout, of Grasiers and Breeders of Cattle. After the Wool of <HI>Lemster</HI> and <HI>Cotswold,</HI> that of the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> comes next in estimation. Besides those places above-mentioned, there is one more, which for its largeness and Fruitfulness alike, is worthy to be men∣tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> The Vale of the <HI>Whitehorse,</HI> which is partly in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and partly in <HI>Barkshire.</HI> For Fruit, there is scarce any County in <HI>England</HI> that is not tolerably well stor'd in one sort or other; but above all for Cherries, and now of late for Pip∣pins, <HI>Kent</HI> bears the Name; and parti∣cularly
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<HI>Tenham,</HI> which is commonly styl'd the Parent of Fruit Gardens: But the first Pippins brought over, that is about 100 years since, were Planted in that part of <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> called <HI>Holland</HI>; and about <HI>Kirton</HI> in the same Shire: Nor are our Cherries of much longer date, being first brought over from <HI>Flanders</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight, and Planted in <HI>Kent,</HI> with that Success, that one only Orchard of but 32 Acnes, is said to have produced in one year, as much as yielded 1000 <HI>l.</HI> For all sorts of Apples and Pears, and for great quantity of ex∣cellent Syder, which furnish <HI>London</HI> and many other parts, <HI>Worcestershire, Glocester∣shire</HI> and <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> are the principal Counties.</P>
<P>Vines we have very frequent among us of several sorts, producing for the most part a very Sweet and Pleasant Grape, and good quantities of Wine, I have heard say, have been formerly made. At this day there are two places principally Eminent for making of Wine, <HI>viz. Claverton</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> a Seat of Sir <HI>William Bassets,</HI> where there are said to have been made some years, no less than 40 Hogsheads of a very pleasant and palatable Wine, and in <HI>Kent</HI> belonging to Collonel <HI>Blunt.</HI> At
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
<HI>Hatfield-House</HI> in <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> belonging to the Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> there is a parcel ground called the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> no doubt from the Plenty and goodness of the Vines there Planted. And in <HI>Glocestershire</HI> there are several places called Vineyards, out of which in former times, they yearly payed Rent-Wines, from the Plenty of Vines no doubt here growing. Moreover it is found in Ancient Records, that several Towns of this Shire payed Rent-Wines, as Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI> in his <HI>Worthys</HI> particularly observes.</P>

<P>BEsides those Beasts and Cattel which are of advantage for Food and Cloath∣ing, and which no Country of <HI>Europe,</HI> per∣haps of the World, bring forth more fair and large than <HI>England</HI>: There are some Beasts of service, which being common to <HI>England</HI> with other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> are ge∣nerally commended to be of a more excel∣lent Kind than any, especially that which is the most serviceable of all others, <HI>viz.</HI> the Horse, with all manner of respects consi∣dered, is doubtless the most noble and use∣ful of all four-footed Beasts; for though the Elephant, Camel, and Dromedary, with which most places of <HI>Asia,</HI> and many of <HI>A∣frica,</HI> abound, are more remarkable for vast bulk of body, especially the Elephant, and consequently more capable of carriage and bearing of great burthens; yet the same greatness of bulk renders them on the o∣ther side more unfit for expedition: and for the Ass and Mule, which indeed are fairer, larger, and more numerous in <HI>Spain</HI> and other Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> than in this Kingdom, they are not certainly to be com∣par'd
<PB N="17" REF="14"/>
either for shape, service, or expedi∣tion with the forementioned Animal; nor was ever any Grandee of <HI>Spain</HI> journying on his Mule with the Grand <HI>Pa</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> gravity so comely a sight, as a well accou∣tred Cavalier on horseback: and of all parts of <HI>England, Montgomeryshire</HI> is commended for excellent Horses: The Truth is, the <HI>Spanish Jenet,</HI> that of <HI>Barbary</HI> Race com∣monly, therefore called the <HI>Barbary:</HI> The Count of <HI>Oldenburgh</HI>'s Breed in <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> have the Name before all others for Swiftness, delicacy of Shape and Neatness, of Mark or Colour; but for Courage, Ability of Body, either for Travel, Draught or Carriage, sufficient Swiftness and Agility, Tractableness for the Great Saddle and Management in War; the Horses of <HI>English</HI> Breed, are reputed hardly match∣able by those of any other Country: And our Dogs much less, by the Testimony of divers Eminent Authors; <HI>Ortelius</HI> in his <HI>Thea∣trum Orbis Terrarum,</HI> affirms, that there is no part of the Earth, where there are better and larger Dogs to be seen, especial∣ly Hounds, he might also have added Mastives: To the same effect <HI>Cambden</HI> writes of our Dogs in general in his <HI>Hant∣shire</HI> and <HI>Middlesex: Burton</HI> also in his Com∣mentaries on <HI>Antoninus</HI> his Itinerary, pre∣fers
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
the <HI>British</HI> Hounds and Mastives be∣fore those of any other Country whatso∣ever. And of our Mastives a <HI>Spanish</HI> Geo∣grapher of good Account, <HI>Lucas de Linda,</HI> in his <HI>Descriptio Orbis,</HI> saith, <HI>That they are the Bravest, the Largest and the Fiercest of any in the World beside: Moreover, that they were in great Request Anciently among the</HI> Romans, <HI>and made use of in their publick Games and Baitings, exhibited in their Amphitheaters,</HI> appears by this Verse of the Poet <HI>Clau∣dian</HI>:
<Q>Magnaque Taurorum fracturi Colla <HI>Britani.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There are likewise some other sorts of Dogs of <HI>English</HI> Breed, which though not so much taken notice of by Authors, I am apt to imagine, are no less excellent and supereminent in their kind, than those above mention'd, as namely, Water-Spa∣niels, Grey-Hounds, Setting-Dogs, and such like of Sport and Game. Lastly, that sort of Dogs that serve only for Show and the slightest of Divertisement; I really be∣lieve that for Neatness of Mark and De∣licacy of Shape, there are scarce to be found elsewhere the like to our Beagles and little Spaniels; and this will appear the more evident to those that shall ob∣serve
<PB N="19" REF="15"/>
this one thing: namely, that where∣as it is a general Curiosity (not to say Va∣nity) among our <HI>English</HI> Gentry, to ad∣mire and delight in Birds, Beasts, and o∣ther things, brought over from <HI>France</HI> and other Foreign Parts, as Parots from <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Monkeys from <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> we find few or none of these above-mention'd Crea∣tures, but what are <HI>English,</HI> at least none so curiously Mark'd and Limb'd as ours. There is said to be bred about <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> a race of very little Dogs, which by their shape seem to be of the Species of Beagles.</P>
<P>As for the Cats of <HI>England,</HI> it is ob∣servable, that the number of Fine Tabby-Cats that are finely Spotted, and as it were Marbled, hath very much increased of late years, whereby it may be probably conjectur'd, that some kinds of those so Curiously Cloathed Cats, have been brought hither from other parts, and par∣ticularly those of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> have been ac∣counted for their Marbled Coats, the choicest of all others; but setting aside the consideration of the Curious Mark or Col∣our, to shew how far ours have the Pre∣eminence in the exercise of that faculty which nature hath implanted in this sort of Creature, that is, the Catching of Mice and other such Vermine; there needs no other

instance, than the History of a very Rich Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> some few Ages ago, who first raised his Fortune from the Venture of an <HI>English</HI> Cat. As for the Eatable Cattle, and several Beasts of Game, some places we find there are, which claim a special Propriety to this or that particular kind. The best Oxen in <HI>England</HI> are said to be in <HI>Lancashire</HI>: In the <HI>New-Forrest</HI> in <HI>Hantshire,</HI> there is very great store of Red-Deer. A late Park near <HI>New-market</HI> in <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> was called <HI>Hare-Park,</HI> by reason of the multitude of Hares, Rabbetts; the best and most are said to be in <HI>Norfolk</HI>; yet I cannot think they much exceed those of <HI>Auburn-Chace</HI> (belonging to my Lord of <HI>Pembroke</HI>) in <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> The best Hogs in <HI>Hantshire.</HI> Of Birds there are few (if any) sorts wan∣ting here, which are frequent in other parts of <HI>England,</HI> whether the most Curi∣ous of Singing Birds, the choicest Fowl both Wild and Tame for the Table, or Birds of Game and Delight: But of some it is observ'd, that what are bred in this Coun∣try, are peculiarly commendable above others, especially the Gallinaceous kind. <HI>Pliny</HI> observes of the Cock, that it is a Bold and Stout Bird, and crows in sign of Triumph immediatly after Victory, and
<PB N="21" REF="16"/>
doubtless scarce any Country affords so Couragious and Martial a Race of Game-Cocks as <HI>England</HI>; a right Cock of the Game seldom or never ceasing on this side Death or Victory. Nor do I remember to have read or heard Report of any Country where the Sport of Cock-Fighting, of which our Countryman <HI>Ascham</HI> hath written a Learned Treatise, is so much used as here: Thus the Dog among Beasts, and the Cock among Birds, seem proper Emblems of true <HI>English</HI> Valour: However let us not repose our chiefest glory in this Vertue alone, but strive to excel in others of a higher nature, which are proper to man alone, since Valour, we see, is a Vertue common to Man with Brute. In the Rocks of <HI>Pembrokeshire</HI> are Hawks of an extraordinary kind, but chiefly of the Species of the Faulcon: In the Forrest of <HI>Shirwood</HI> in <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI> and in the Forrest of <HI>Dean</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> the Hawk called the Lanar, whose Female is the Laneret, is very frequent: Near <HI>Kinsland</HI> in <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> is often seen the Hawk called Lanius, the Butcher or Murthering Bird. Along the Sea-Coasts of <HI>England,</HI> from the <HI>West</HI> as far as <HI>Dover</HI>; but chiefly upon the Sea-Coasts of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> there frequents a sort of Chough or Jack-daw,
<PB N="22" REF="17"/>
which is thence commonly called the <HI>Cor∣nish</HI> Chough, supposed the same with the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
of <HI>Aristotle.</HI> In <HI>New-Forrest</HI> in <HI>Hantshire</HI> chiefly breeds the <HI>Ʋpupa</HI> or Hoop. In the <HI>Fens</HI> of <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> the <HI>Attagen</HI> or Godwitt. On <HI>Newmarket-Heath</HI> and <HI>Salisbury-Plains,</HI> the <HI>Bistarda</HI> or Bustard. In the Isle of <HI>Thanet</HI> a sort of Wild-Goose, commonly called a Birgan∣der, in Latin <HI>Vulpancer.</HI> In several parts of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> two sorts of Birds, rarely seen elsewhere, <HI>viz.</HI> the Puffin and the Ganet. Also in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> the Foolish Bird called the <HI>Dottrel,</HI> is so frequent, that the people of those parts have very good Sport in the Catching of it, as <HI>Cambden</HI> relates.</P>
<P>The places of <HI>England</HI> most eminenly Famous for several sorts of Fish, are <HI>New-castle</HI> upon <HI>Tine</HI> for Salmon; as also <HI>Bywell</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and the River <HI>Wye</HI> in <HI>He∣refordshire,</HI> also the River <HI>Lune</HI> near <HI>Cocker∣fand-Abbey</HI> in <HI>Lancashire.</HI> The Coast of <HI>Cornwall</HI> for Herrings; there being there so great a Trade of Herring-Fishing, that there is scarce the like again in any place of <HI>Europe</HI>; at <HI>Limmouth</HI> also in <HI>Dorcetshire</HI> there is taken great quantity of Herrings; at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> the Herrings are very large and good, and are therefore called <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Capons. <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and some
<PB N="23" REF="17"/>
other places thereabout upon the <HI>Severn,</HI> for a Fish call'd a Mort, which in Taste hath very much of the Salmon in it; <HI>Sussex</HI> in general for Carps: For Lobsters <HI>Chichester,</HI> the chief Town of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and <HI>Selsey</HI> (so called, <HI>qu.</HI> Isle of Seals or Sea-Calves) in the same County; the first for small ones, but very Sweet and well Tasted; the se∣cond for those esteemed, not only because of their Goodness, but also their Fulness and Largeness; for Cockles▪ the same <HI>Sel∣sey.</HI> For Oysters <HI>Colchester,</HI> the chief Town of <HI>Essex,</HI> and several places of <HI>Kent,</HI> espe∣cially <HI>Whitstaple</HI> and <HI>Reculver,</HI> which for Oysters of savoury saltness, exceed all other parts of that County, especially <HI>Re∣culver.</HI> There is a sort of small Fish called a Pilchard, commonly about the bigness of a Herring (though I have heard say, that in some parts of <HI>Cornwall</HI> there have been taken Pilchards an Ell long) and not much differing in shape in several places on the Sea-coasts of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> At a place called <HI>Foreditch</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> there are Trouts of a treble remark: First, That they equal Salmon in Largeness. Secondly, That they remain nine Months in the Sea, and three in Fresh-water. Thirdly, That contrary to the nature of all other Trouts, they have been known but once to have been
<PB N="24" REF="18"/>
taken in that place with an Angle, so much more cunning they are than all the rest of their kind. In the River <HI>Kennet</HI> near <HI>Hungerford</HI> in <HI>Barkshire,</HI> there is great plenty of Trouts, remarkably large and good; also the Town of <HI>Hungerford</HI> it self, <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and some other Places there∣about, are noted for plenty and goodness of Cray-Fish. The River <HI>Stowr</HI> in <HI>Dor∣cetshire</HI> hath a particular commendation for Tenches, as some parts of <HI>Cambridge∣shire</HI> for the best Eels, and <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> for plenty of Pikes: But there is also another Stowr in <HI>Kent,</HI> which runs through <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> and is said to breed the best Trouts in the <HI>South-East</HI> of <HI>England</HI>: Yet those of <HI>Cashalton</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI> are accounted excellent Trouts. In <HI>Miander-Meer</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> there breeds a sort of Fish called a Chare, which they say is no where else to be found. Much more might be said, (but that it is not our business to dwell upon any particular, but to take a general Sur∣vey of several things) of the Animals which our Country excels in above others; but to speak of the Minerals and Vegetables which this Island produceth, would re∣quire each a large Volume; and though we have no Mines of Gold, yet the many Mines we have of other Mettalls, as Iron,
<PB N="25" REF="18"/>
Lead, Tin, Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (and it is said some discoveries have been also made of Silver, besides Mines of Allum▪ Coal and other Minerals, would, if utmost Im∣provement were made of our Trade and Manufacture, make a considerable compen∣sation. The <HI>Stanneries</HI> or Tin-Mines of <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devonshire</HI> have been famous from all Antiquity: And whereas it hath been formerly taken for granted, that the <HI>Britains</HI> were unknown to the rest of the World before the Arrival of the <HI>Romans</HI>; there are not wanting who are of Opinion, and have confirmed their Opinion with probable Evidences, that the Ancient In∣habitants of this Island, long before the <HI>Romans</HI> Arrival, had Commerce with the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Phaenicians</HI>; and that because they would not admit of Strangers into their Country, therefore they made the Isles of <HI>Scilly</HI> the Mart for the vending of their Tin; whereupon some suppose them to be those Islands which the Ancients cal∣led the <HI>Cassiterides,</HI> which imports as much as Tin-Isles; not as having any Tin-Mines in them, but as being the Mart, as we said before, for the Vending of that Commo∣dity. And of all parts in <HI>Cornwall, Godol∣phin-Hill</HI> is particularly taken notice of for its Rich and Plentiful Veins of Tin. Nor
<PB N="26" REF="19"/>
do the Mines of <HI>Cornwall</HI> abound in Tin only, but 'tis said there have been quan∣tities of Metallick Oar that have contain'd a mixture of Gold and Silver; and very memorable is the tradition of a quantity of Silver Oar, dig'd out of a place in the Parish of <HI>Comb-Martin</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> out of which <HI>William Wimondham</HI> coin'd 270 weight of Silver for <HI>Elionor</HI> Dutchess of <HI>Bar.</HI> A place called <HI>Newlands</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> is rich in Copper Mines, and hath some store of Black-Lead; especially about <HI>Keswick.</HI> In this County also, the Stone called <HI>Lapis Calaminaris,</HI> is said to have been here first found: But much of this <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> is digg'd out of <HI>Mendip∣hills</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire.</HI> At <HI>Wenlock</HI> in <HI>Shrop∣shire,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, there was found a Rich Copper Mine. The Rich Mines of Iron in the Forrest of <HI>Dean</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> have been an occasion of making those Woods very thin, in respect of what they have been formerly. <HI>Kent</HI> hath several Iron Mines, and also Veins of Marl. <HI>Darbyshire</HI> abounds much in Minerals, and several kinds of Stones; particularly in the <HI>Peak</HI> of <HI>Darby,</HI> there are Mines that afford plenty of Lead, likewise <HI>Stibium</HI> or Antimony, also store of Mill-stones and Whet-stones; nor less
<PB N="27" REF="19"/>
noted are the Lead-Mines on <HI>Mendip-hills</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire</HI>: As also those on the Hills of <HI>Richmondshire,</HI> where there are likewise Copper-Mines; near <HI>Moinglath</HI> in <HI>Denby∣shire,</HI> is a plentiful Vein of Lead: So like∣wise in the <HI>Abby of Fountains</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> not far from whence in the same Shire is store of Iron: Other Mines also there are, which though not so Rich, are no less use∣ful than those of Mettal; as Alom, Coal, Free-stone, Fullers-earth, Marl, with all which, take one with another, there is surely no Nation better stor'd; and indeed our Salt-pits are no other than a kind of Liquid-Mines. It is no less wonderful to observe what abundant Supplies of Fewel are yearly sent up from the Coal-Mines of <HI>Newcastle</HI> to this Vast City of <HI>London,</HI> and other parts of the Nation, besides what is Exported into Foraign parts; then it may seem hard to conjecture how this City could subsist before the discovery of this great Mine, which was not till the year 1305. Since we find by experience, up∣on any occasion of the obstructing of this <HI>Newcastle</HI> Fleet, and the raising of the Price of Coals, into what great distress and in∣conveniency the City is thereupon reduc'd; but then it must be considered that the City then was nothing near so large as
<PB N="28" REF="20"/>
now, and the Country far better stor'd with Wood; the want whereof for Firing, is not the only prejudice the Nation hath sustain'd by the vast quantity of Timber that hath been fell'd of late Ages; the number of Alehouses is also increas'd ten to one, at least within these 100 years, and pro∣portionably, as may well be imagin'd, the number of Brewhouses to supply them with Drink; which Houses cannot be maintain'd and carry on their Trade, with∣out a wonderful quantity of Fewel: Nor need it be wondred how other great Cities are able to subsist without the like con∣venience (as doubtless there is scarce any City of the World that hath the like ad∣vantage for Fewel) considering the diffe∣rence of Climate, of Customs, of manner of Living, and of Diet. There are who speak of <HI>Blackheath,</HI> as a place no less sufficient∣ly abounding with Pit-Coal to serve the City of <HI>London</HI> and parts adjacent, than <HI>Newcastle</HI> it self, but are willing to believe that the grand security of these Coal-pits, lies in the great prejudice to Navigation, which the breaking of them up would oc∣casion, in regard this Colliers Trade be∣tween <HI>Newcastle</HI> and <HI>London</HI> is the greatest Nursery of Seamen we have; which ob∣jection would easily cease, could the Fish∣ing
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>
Trade be once promoted, till when the Coal Mines of <HI>Blackheath</HI> must of ne∣cessity be laid aside. There is also Sea-Coal, like that of <HI>Newcastle</HI> at <HI>Wedsborough</HI> in the <HI>East-Riding</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI>: Likewise up and down in many of the Inland parts of <HI>England,</HI> there is abundance of Pit-Coal of another nature, that is too say, not Caking or Clinging together (a quantity of small Particles) into one great lump or mass, like that of <HI>Newcastle</HI>; but as it is laid on in great pieces, burning sheer a∣way into Ashes, each piece like Wood. Up and down in several parts of <HI>Darbyshire</HI> and <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> there is a sort of Pit-Coal, which is commonly called Cannel-Coal, perhaps as it were Candle-Coal, because it burns clear like a Candle; this Coal is of a bright shining gloss, and with∣al of so tough and solid a substance, that they frequently make thereof Standishes, Salt-Sellers, Candlesticks and other such like Utensils, which appear as it were of a courser sort of Jett. In <HI>Staffordshire, Pensneth-Chace</HI> is particularly made men∣tion of for plenty of Pit-Coal. In <HI>Leicester∣shire, Coal-Overton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>West-Goscot,</HI> and other parts of the <HI>North</HI> of this County, where there is store of Pit-Coal of a Bituminous nature, very hard and
<PB N="30" REF="21"/>
fast: In <HI>Warwickshire, Bedworth</HI>: In <HI>Somer∣setshire, Mendip-hill,</HI> and several places on the shore of the River <HI>Frome</HI>: In <HI>Rich∣mondshire,</HI> the tops of certain Hills. In the Isle of <HI>Anglesey</HI> there is said to be great store of an Aluminous Matter, out of which it is thought might be made very good Alum and Copperass, but nothing of this nature hath been brought to that perfecti∣on, as the Alum-works in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> through the great Industry of Sir <HI>John Bourchier,</HI> who in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> made away with a considerable Estate for the carrying on of this great work, in lieu whereof he obtain'd the grant of a Patent from the King, whereby he was Invested with the whole benefit of the said Alum∣work, which was valued at a Thousand Pound a year; but however matters were carried, his Grandchild Mr. <HI>Richard Bour∣chier,</HI> is now reduc'd to utmost necessity, receiving no relief by vertue of the Patent for the loss of the Paternal Estate: But <HI>Gesborough</HI> in this Shire is most particular∣ly noted for an Alum-Mine, which some say was first found out by Sir <HI>Thomas Cha∣loner</HI> Tutor to Prince <HI>Henry.</HI> As for the Stone-Quarries of <HI>England,</HI> they must in∣deed be confess'd inferior to those of <HI>Italy, Greece,</HI> and other parts, for all Curious

kinds of Marble, Alabaster and Porphyrie▪ (of Marble the Parian was Anciently ac∣counted the best:) However we have many Structures both publick and private to shew, which being built of our own na∣tive Free-stone, want not their State and Elegance. The principal Magazine of this Commodity, is the Isle of <HI>Portland</HI> in <HI>Dor∣cetshire,</HI> which hath supplied many of the grand Buildings of <HI>England.</HI> Likewise the Isle of <HI>Purbeck</HI> in the same Shire, hath Veins of Marble, which though not con∣tinued, but scatteringly here and there, as <HI>Cambden</HI> observes, yet run a great way under ground. At <HI>Edgcomb</HI> House near <HI>Plimouth</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> there is digg'd good quantity of a Stone, which is of great use and Ornament in Building; also on the Moors of the said County, there is found a sort of Stone, which is thence called the Moor-stone, of which there are frequently made Chimney-Pieces and Ornaments of Windows and Doors; besides another sort of the colour of Marble. In <HI>Nottingham∣shire</HI> there is digg'd a soft Stone, at least much softer than Alabaster, with which being burnt and made into a Plaster, they generally floor their Upper-Rooms, this Plaster being well laid, as soon as it comes to be dry, proves harder than any Plaster

of <HI>Paris,</HI> and is wonderful durable. In <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> hard by <HI>Snodhill-Castle,</HI> is a Quarry, from whence they say there is digg'd forth very good Marble. At a place called <HI>Peter</HI>'s-<HI>post</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> is a famous Quarry of Stone; also near <HI>Shirburn</HI> in the same Shire: Nor is that near <HI>Manchester</HI> in <HI>Laneashire</HI> inconsiderable; besides a Quarry of a fine Reddish-stone on the Banks of the River <HI>Irwell</HI> in the same Shire: Moreover, what we want in Alabaster, <HI>Porphyrie</HI> Marble, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is more than compensated to us by Stones of a greater value, particular∣ly in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> there are found in great quantities Stones of a natural Smoothness, formed into Angles, and considerably large, some of the bigness of a Walnut, or thereabout, and of such a lustre, that many scruple not to call them Diamonds, and probably they might pass for such, did not the cunning Lapidary know how to distinguish the true Orient Diamond from others by its <HI>Adamantine</HI> hardness and solidity: Likewise St. <HI>Vincents</HI> Rock at <HI>Bristol</HI> affords plenty of these <HI>English</HI> Diamonds, commonly called <HI>Bristol</HI> Stones: At <HI>Shugbury</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire</HI> is a sort of precious Stone, at least by some so accoun∣ted, called <HI>Astroites,</HI> from a mark it hath upon it resembling a Star. And on the
<PB N="33" REF="22"/>
Rocks of <HI>Guarnsey,</HI> there is a hard Stone called an Emeril. Nor are we wholly destitute of Marble and Alabaster, though doubtless short for Beauty and Fineness to those of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Greece</HI>; in some parts of <HI>Staffordshire</HI> there is digg'd a sort of Ala∣baster, thought to be the best in <HI>England.</HI> Fullers-Earth, Potters-Earth, Marl, Lime, Slate, Tobacco-Pipe-Clay, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are large Veins in several parts, particu∣larly <HI>Woburn</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire</HI> abounds in Fullers-Earth; as also <HI>Rigate</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI>: In some parts of <HI>Wiltshire</HI> the store of Marl that is found there, gives Appellation to one of the chief Towns of that Shire, <HI>viz. Marlborough,</HI> and in divers parts of <HI>Lan∣cashire,</HI> is found a Marl, which very much enriches the Land. Near <HI>Nonsuch</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI> is a large Vein of Potters-Earth. Near <HI>Walsal</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> are store of Lime-Pits: And not many Miles from <HI>Pomfret</HI> in <HI>York∣shire,</HI> it being averr'd by some that no less than 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year usually made of the Lime thereabouts.</P>
<P>In some parts of <HI>Cornwall</HI> there is Slate of three sorts and colours, <HI>viz.</HI> The Blew, the Grey, and the Sage-colour; particu∣larly at a place called <HI>Walling-slate</HI> in <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> is digg'd up great store of Slate: As also at <HI>Collyweston</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> at
<PB N="34" REF="23"/>
<HI>Pool</HI> in <HI>Dorcetshire,</HI> and in the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI> the best Tobacco-Pipe-Clay. And to the Mill-stones of the <HI>Peak</HI> before mentioned, we may add those digg'd up at <HI>Mowcup</HI> in <HI>Cheshire.</HI> There is a sort of Earth called Talcum, us'd by Painters and Colourers, of which store is dig'd up in several parts of <HI>Sussex</HI>: And the best of Saltpeter, is said to be found in <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI> Out of the Salt-pits of <HI>England</HI> is extracted so white and fine a sort of Salt, that the most refined Sugar looks not more white and fine; it is also commonly made up into Masses, in the form of Sugar-Loaves: Most of these <HI>Wiches,</HI> the most noted, are in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> all denominated accordingly, <HI>viz. Nantwich, Middlewich</HI> and <HI>North∣wich; Nantwich,</HI> besides the considerati∣on of its Salt-pit, which is generally called the <HI>Whitewich,</HI> is next to the City of <HI>Chester</HI> it self, the most Eminent Town of all <HI>Cheshire: Middlewich</HI> hath two Pits, between which there runs a small Brook and parts them: The Pit in <HI>Northwich</HI> is called the <HI>Black-wich</HI>; I suppose because the Salt drawn hence is Blacker and Courser than any of the rest. In <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> there is also a place of principal note for these Wiches or Salt-pits, <HI>viz. Droit-Wich,</HI> or <HI>Dirt-Wich,</HI> where there are three Wells,
<PB N="35" REF="23"/>
whose water from <HI>Christmass</HI> till <HI>Midsummer</HI> is of so Brackish a nature, that all that time they boil great quantities of Salt out of it in Furnaces, which for that end are erect∣ed near the Wells; whereas all the rest of the year the water is so fresh, that no Salt can be extracted out of it.</P>
<P>As for those Plants and Shrubs which are most peculiarly of the growth of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> it would be too particular a Sub∣ject for this so general a Work, to assign each its several place, as there are very many places where this or that Herb, Tree or Shrub, hath as it were its peculiar na∣tivity and education: All the whole Coun∣ty of <HI>Buckingham</HI> is denominated from the great number of Beech-Trees there grow∣ing: The Isle of <HI>Scalny</HI> in <HI>Pembrokeshire,</HI> is almost all over grown with Wild-Time; But there are some Plants, which being of themselves not ordinary or common, or of a more than common Vertue or Efficacy, do so much the more signalize the places where they grow, especially being the on∣ly noted places of their production. The Saffron about <HI>Walden</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> is so emi∣nently reputed above the Saffron of any other parts, that that Town is never men∣tioned but by the name of <HI>Saffron-Walden.

or <HI>Broken-Bridge</HI>; besides its strong and stately Castle, is noted for the great quantity of Liquorice that grows there∣about, (as also a sort of Plant called Skir∣worts, whose Root is much esteem'd and Eaten by the Curious for a great delicacy, by reason of its Richness and high Nourish∣ment:) Nor is <HI>Worksop</HI> in <HI>Nottinghamshire</HI> less eminent for Liquorice. <HI>Hallifax</HI> in the <HI>West-Riding</HI> of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> is noted for several things which we shall have occasion to make mention of elsewhere: But among other things the Nuts growing thereabout, are by way of eminency call'd <HI>Hallifax</HI> Nuts. At <HI>Barklow</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> there grows in great abundance an Herb, bearing Red-Berries, called <HI>Danewort,</HI> from a Traditi∣on that it sprang first from the Blood of the <HI>Danes:</HI> On the Cliffs between <HI>Deal</HI> and <HI>Dover,</HI> great plenty of Samphire grows; <HI>Westward</HI> from <HI>Dengeness</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> Pease spring up naturally in Clusters like Grapes, and differ not much in Taste from common-field Pease. Between <HI>Sandwich</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> a kind of Hops is observed to grow naturally among the Beach and Pebbles; Garlick is no where better nor more plentiful, than at <HI>Stratton</HI> in <HI>Cornwall</HI>: Several parts of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and <HI>Porbery</HI> most peculiarly in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="24"/>
produce wild Strawberies in abundance; no less noted is <HI>Axminster</HI> in <HI>Devonshire</HI> for Hurtleberries. At <HI>Summervil</HI> near <HI>Chappel,</HI> two Mile from <HI>Blanford</HI> in <HI>Dorcetshire,</HI> on on the hither side of the River at <HI>Sturpain,</HI> there is a most plentiful production of Madder; how long this Plant hath been in <HI>England</HI> is uncertain, but it is above 50 years since a considerable quantity of it was produced at <HI>Barn-Elms</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI>; and Sir <HI>Nicholas Crisp</HI> sow'd several sorts of it, as Crop-Madder, Umber Ow, and Pipe or flat Madder at <HI>Deptford</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> which County affords plenty of Flax; but the best Hemp is said to grow between <HI>Bemister</HI> and <HI>Bird∣port</HI> in <HI>Dorcetshire. St. Foin</HI> or Holy-Hay, was first brought out of <HI>France</HI> from about <HI>Paris,</HI> and first sow'd at <HI>Copt-Hall</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> Tamarisk was first brought over from <HI>Switzerland</HI> by Bishop <HI>Tindal</HI> in the days of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> (from whose displeasure he fled) and planted in his Garden at <HI>Fullham.</HI> On the top of <HI>Pendle-hill</HI> in <HI>Lan∣cashire,</HI> there grows a Plant peculiar to that place called <HI>Cloudesberry,</HI> probably for that it seems as it were to come out of the Clouds. In the Fens of <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> there is commonly gathered an Herb call'd Water-Germander; in Latin <HI>Scordium,</HI> which being the chief Ingredient, con∣sequently
<PB N="38" REF="25"/>
gives name to that great <HI>Alexi∣pharmacon,</HI> so much known and used a∣mong us called <HI>Diascordium.</HI> About <HI>Gla∣stenbury</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> there is plenty of Woad; and at <HI>Cashalton</HI> in <HI>Surry</HI> of excel∣lent Walnuts.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Wonders and Ra∣rities of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Wonders of <HI>England</HI> consist chiefly in Stones, Caves, Lakes, Fountains, Ditches, and several prodigious Tu∣muli or Hillocks cast up by Art and Labour; there was never doubtless heard of in any part of the World, so miraculous a Monu∣ment of Stones, for so it is generally sup∣posed to be, as that on <HI>Salisbury-Plain,</HI> within six or seven Miles of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> com∣monly called <HI>Stone-henge</HI>; it appears to have been a treble row of Stones, circu∣larly plac'd one within another, and rear'd streight up on end, notwithstanding they are of a prodigious bigness, that is to say, 28 Foot long for the most part, and 7 Foot broad, besides others of a vast bulk
<PB N="39" REF="25"/>
(though not so big as the upright ones) which lye overthwart from one to another, and are fastened with Tenent and Mortis; but the form of this wonderful Structure is very much defac'd, some of the greater Stones being either fallen, or reclining to∣wards the ground, and many of the over∣thwart Stones being fallen; how such huge Stones could be brought thither, by whom, and upon what occasion, is disputed by Writers; the most that hath been said on this Subject is written by Mr. <HI>Inigo Jones</HI> Surveyor General to King <HI>James,</HI> and his late Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the first, and Dr. <HI>Charleton,</HI> both various, and oft times contrary in their Opinions, and possibly neither of them altogether in the right: About half a dozen Mile further on the <HI>Plain</HI> towards <HI>Hungerford,</HI> I have ob∣served (nor do I remember it to have been taken notice of by any one else) a Stone of a great bulk, but not above a Foot and a half in heighth from the ground, which though of the same hardness and solidity with those above mentioned, hath the top of it driven all over full of Nails of the largest size. There is also a part of the <HI>Plain</HI> between <HI>Marleborough</HI> and <HI>Caun,</HI> which being strew'd all over with Stones of a Grey colour, is therefore called the
<PB N="40" REF="26"/>
<HI>Grey Weathers</HI>; the least of these Stones be∣ing of a considerable bigness, and some very large; those of the ordinary size seeming to be of about half a dozen or half a score Pound weight, one with another; and here and there in some odd nooks, a little out of the Road, a large Stone reared up on end, like those at <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> and sometimes not much inferior in bulk. In <HI>Staffordshire</HI> there is a Market-Town called <HI>Stone,</HI> from a large heap of Stones cast up there, as a Monumental mark of Infamy upon <HI>Wulpher</HI> the <HI>Mercian,</HI> who in this very place sacrific'd to his Heathenish fury his two Sons, <HI>Wulfald</HI> and <HI>Rufinus,</HI> for no other cause than their imbracing the Chri∣stian Faith. Near <HI>Burrowbridge,</HI> a little Town in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> there are four Stones of a very vast bulk, and Pyramidally shap'd, suppos'd to be erected by the <HI>Romans,</HI> in memory of some great Victory thereabouts obtain'd. Upon the Hills near <HI>North-Tine</HI> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> though Boggy and full of water, there are great heaps of Stones, which some take for a Memorial of some great Battle there fought. Near <HI>Enisham</HI> in the <HI>South</HI> part of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> there are Stones called <HI>Roll-rich-stones,</HI> erected in manner of those at <HI>Stone-henge</HI>; which certain fabulous Traditions have rendred
<PB N="41" REF="26"/>
to have been men so transform'd; but more certain History delivers them the Monument of a great Battle there fought by <HI>Rollo</HI> the <HI>Dane.</HI> At <HI>Bosken</HI> in <HI>Cornwall</HI> there is another of 18 large Stones erected, and plac'd in a circular figure 12 Foot distant each from the other; a Trophy of some <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Saxon</HI> Victory. In the same County are other Monumental Stones called the <HI>Hurlers,</HI> which fabulous Tradi∣tion will have to be the Stony Metamor∣phosis of certain Humane Creatures, but common reason gives the same conjecture of them as of the foremention'd. The like may be said of two other large Stones erected in St. <HI>Clares</HI> Parish, in one where∣of there is an Inscription in strange and intelligible Characters; other Remarks there are in the same County form'd by Nature only, as that Pile of Rocks one upon the other, called <HI>Wring-Cheese,</HI> near the lowest of them, having the resem∣blance of a Cheese hard press'd, by the accumulation of Rocks upon it; the other is a very wonderful Rock call'd <HI>Main-Amber,</HI> near <HI>Pensans</HI>; this Rock lies upon lesser Rocks, in such an exact <HI>equilibrium,</HI> that what the push of a Finger, can stir and cause as it were to totter, not the greatest force imaginable is able to displace.
<PB N="42" REF="27"/>
Likewise by <HI>Helford,</HI> is a vast Rock lying on the ground, the top whereof being hollow, containeth water which ebbeth and floweth like the Sea. Three Miles from <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> on the edge of <HI>Sussex,</HI> there lye scattered up and down in a dry Sandy-ground, divers Craggy-stones of a considerable magnitude; the two biggest whereof standing close together, seem by the crease which divides them in a straight line, as if they were but just saw'd asun∣der. In the same County, near <HI>Tenderden-Steeple,</HI> is a Stone, which by the falling of the Rain, palpably gathers increase of bulk. At <HI>Exmore</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> are great Stones erected, some in a Circular, some in a Triangular form, in memory doubtless of some <HI>Roman, Saxon</HI> or <HI>Danish</HI> Victory. In <HI>Westmorland,</HI> near the River <HI>Loder,</HI> there are Pyramidal Stones pitched for a Mile together, some 9, some 14 Foot thick. At <HI>Salcelds</HI> upon the River <HI>Eden</HI> in <HI>Cum∣berland,</HI> is a Monumental Trophy, con∣sisting of 77 Stones, called by the Inhabi∣tants <HI>Long-Meg and her Daughters</HI>; one of which Stones alone, called the <HI>Long-Meg,</HI> being 15 Foot high from the ground, all the rest but 10. On the Hill called <HI>Mind∣gate-Morgan</HI> in <HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> there is a Monument superscrib'd with a very fatal
<PB N="43" REF="27"/>
Character; for it hath been received from those that live thereabout, that whoever reads it shall die soon after, if there be not a fallacy herein, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Character is so strange and uncouth that no man is able to read it.</P>
<P>Some places are noted for Stones of another kind, that is to say, whose Ra∣rity consists in the unusualness of their Figure. At <HI>Alderly</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> upon the top of certain Hills are found Oysters, Cockles and Periwinkles of solid Stone; and at <HI>Puckle-Church</HI> in the same Shire, there is a Vein of Blew-stone, consisting of several Stones, Smooth, Square, and about half a Foot thick, as it were Arti∣ficial and ready cut out fit for work; they lye about seven or eight one upon another, as it were in beds very near, contiguous to each other for about the length of a Pearch. And at <HI>Lassington</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> there is plenty of that which we call the Star-stone, being of the figure of a Mullet, or what we commonly picture for a Star, of a Grey colour, and of the circumference of a single Penny, but the thickness of half a Crown; they stick together in Co∣lumns of about three or four Inches long, and being singly put into Vinegar, they na∣turally move and tend towards a Unition.
<PB N="44" REF="28"/>
Near <HI>Sayworth</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> are Stones that have a very near resemblance of Cockles. In a Town call'd <HI>Cainsham,</HI> in the Road-way between <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Bristol,</HI> and in the High∣way thereabout, there are Stones frequently to be seen wreathing in a Spiral form like Snails; this Town is commonly Nick-nam'd <HI>Smoaky-Cainsham</HI> upon this occasion: Some years since one of the Townsmen standing at his door with Tears in his Eyes, and be∣ing ask'd by one of his Neighbours that ob∣serv'd him as he pass'd by, what the cause of his Grief was, answered, <HI>That there was so great a Smoak in his house that he was not able to endure to stay within doors</HI>; When in truth he had been newly beaten by his Wife: Whereupon Travellers now and then to make themselves Sport, will ask, <HI>Whether that Town be called</HI> Smoaky-Cainsham: But the wiser sort of those that ask this question, prepare at the same instant to put on to a more than or∣dinary speed, for fear of some Hostility from the good Women of the place. At <HI>Whitbay</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> are Stones of a <HI>Ser∣pentine</HI> Figure: Also in the Stone-Quarry at <HI>Kingham</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire.</HI> On <HI>Rose∣mary-Topping</HI> a Hill in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> are Stones found in the shape of Sea-winkles and Cockles: At <HI>Huntly-Nab</HI> in the same
<PB N="45" REF="28"/>
County, at the roots of the Rocks, are Stones as perfectly round as any Ball, in which broken, are the shapes of Stony-Serpents, all but the head. Of the Caves of <HI>England,</HI> those of principal remark are, First, <HI>Ochy-hole</HI> near <HI>Wells</HI> in <HI>Somerset∣shire</HI>; it is a Cave of large extent into the earth, and in which, those that have made the farthest Incursions, are said to have discerned many Rivulets and Ca∣verns, or hollow Recesses. Secondly, A Cave very much talk'd of, under an Old Castle in the <HI>Peak</HI> of <HI>Darby,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Devils Arse in Peak</HI>; there is a strange story told by one <HI>Gervasius,</HI> of a Swinherd belonging to one <HI>William de Pe∣nerel,</HI> sometime Lord of the Place. This Swinherd having lost a Sow great with Pig, is said to have entred in earnest quest thereof into the mouth of this Cave, and passing through several obscure Nooks and windings, to have come at length into a spacious Field, where among a com∣pany of Reapers he found his Masters Sow which had newly Pig'd; and making his Case known to the chief person in Office there, brought back his Sow, together with her Pigs, returning the same way he came. Thirdly, In the same County another Cave, called <HI>Eldenhole</HI> in the <HI>Peak</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="29"/>
Forrest, which shoots directly down into the Earth, and as far as 60 yards of depth is to be seen into the mouth or entrance, on the top is about 30 yards in length, and 15 in breadth, but downwards it straigh∣tens into a much narrower space. Fourthly, Certain Caves called the <HI>Gyants Caves,</HI> be∣tween great <HI>Badmin</HI> and <HI>Lockington,</HI> on the border of <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> At a place called <HI>Oxen∣hall,</HI> not far from <HI>Darlington</HI> in the Bishop∣rick of <HI>Durham,</HI> there are three Pits of an extraordinary depth, commonly called <HI>Hell-Kettles,</HI> suppos'd to be produc'd by an Earthquake, which hapned in the year 1179. And near <HI>Tilbury</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> there are several Pits in a Chalky ground, which are judg'd to be no less than 12 Fathom deep. Also near <HI>Feversham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> there are many Pits, which being somewhat narrow at the top, and widening towards the bottom, are distinguished into several Rooms or Apartments, and supported as it were with Pillars of Chalk. At a House of the Marquess of <HI>Worcester</HI>'s at <HI>Emsbury,</HI> I have been told, that at the pulling down of an old Wall, the Labourers discovered a Cavity, which upon search led to a large Cave, where there was found a Monument of great Antiquity and Riches, which by the Character, and
<PB N="47" REF="29"/>
some other circumstances, appears to have been the Tomb of Queen <HI>Guinever,</HI> Wife to King <HI>Arthur</HI>: Near <HI>Kirby-Longdale</HI> in <HI>Westmorland,</HI> are many deep places like Caves. Fifthly, At <HI>Aberbarry</HI> in <HI>Glamor∣ganshire,</HI> there is a Cave at the bottom of a Hill, the mouth whereof is a gaping Clift or Chink, into which, when the Wind enters, there is heard a kind of har∣monious noice, as it were of Cymbals: There hath been also heard from a Clift on the Sea-side, near the Island <HI>Barry,</HI> a sound as it were of Smiths at work, and this by the Testimony of <HI>Lilius Giraldus.</HI> Lakes and Fountains there are very many among us, which have something strange and extraordinary in them: Near <HI>Brereton</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> which belongs to an Eminent Family of the same Name, there is a Pool, wherein the bodies of Trees swimming are said to presage the Death of some of the Family. There are two Lakes very near to each other, hard by St. <HI>Agnes-Hill</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> of which it is credibly reported, that in the one of them Fish will live and thrive, in the other not. In <HI>Lanca∣shire</HI> near <HI>Furness-Fells,</HI> there is a standing water, accounted the greatest in <HI>England,</HI> commonly called <HI>Miander-Meer,</HI> being no less than 10 Miles in length, and all along
<PB N="48" REF="30"/>
paved with stone at the bottom: It is said moreover, that a Fish call'd a Ohare, breeds here only, and no where else. In <HI>Huntingtonshire</HI> there are several Lakes, (and among the rest one called <HI>Wittlesmeer-Lake</HI>) which in fairest weather grow tem∣pestuous, and rage with violent surges like the Sea. In <HI>Staffordshire</HI> there are two remarkable Lakes; of one, <HI>Necham</HI> delivers, <HI>That by its Roaring it foretells things to come,</HI> the other is call'd <HI>Mahal,</HI> of which the Tradition goes, <HI>That Horses when tir'd, drinking of the water thereof, be∣comes fresh as ever</HI>: Of this <HI>Gervase</HI> of <HI>Tilbury</HI> makes particular mention. On the high Hills of <HI>Carnarvonshire,</HI> there are two Meers of a strange nature (if report be true) for one is said to produce a sort of Fish that hath but one Eye; the other to have a floatable Island, whereon no sooner any one sets foot, but it drives farther off from the shoar. There is also at <HI>Bala</HI> in <HI>Me∣rionethshire,</HI> a Pool which never fills by Land-floods, though rising never so high, but in tempestuous weather, swelleth above its Banks. At <HI>Lynsavathan</HI> in <HI>Brecknock∣shire,</HI> is a Meer which is said to have swal∣lowed up a City, that once stood in the room thereof; through this Meer runs the River <HI>Levenny,</HI> keeping its own stream in∣tire
<PB N="49" REF="30"/>
and unmix'd. At <HI>Kilken</HI> in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> is a little Well which hath a constant eb∣bing and flowing like the Sea. At <HI>Giggles∣worth</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> there are three small Springs, of two whereof there is nothing of observable, but the middlemost hath a constant course of ebbing and flowing four times an hour; the difference between its highest rise and lowest fall, being about eight Inches. Likewise in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> in the <HI>Forrest</HI> of the <HI>Peak,</HI> is such another Spring ebbing and flowing 4 times an hour, observing a constant and due revolution of its tydes. On the River <HI>Ogmore</HI> in <HI>Glamor∣ganshire,</HI> there is a Well which every full tyde in <HI>Summer</HI> time is almost destitute of wa∣ter, but at ebb is replenish'd, many times very near, but never totally to an overflowing. Another there is at <HI>Carry-Castle</HI> in <HI>Caermar∣denshire,</HI> which ebbs and flows. Another in <HI>Westmorland,</HI> near the River <HI>Loder,</HI> which ebbs and flows several times a day. At <HI>Lemington</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> a Salt Spring ariseth at a great distance from the Sea. Near <HI>Kenet</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> the water breaking but of certain stones, is accounted a sign of Dearth. The River <HI>Can</HI> in <HI>Westmor∣land</HI> hath Cataracts, which by their fall foretell either Rain or fair Weather. The rising of a Bourn near <HI>Croiden</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="31"/>
is said to presage Mortality. Near <HI>St. Al∣bans</HI> in <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> there is a Brook cal∣led, which when it breaketh out, pre∣sageth Dearth, or some other Calamity. In a private mans Yard at <HI>Pitchford</HI> in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> is a Well whose waters cast up a Skum of liquid <HI>Bitumen.</HI> In the <HI>North∣riding</HI> of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> are Wells called <HI>Tingtong</HI> Wells, three Miles within the earth. The Petrifying Wells and Springs of <HI>England</HI> are very many, nor is it worth the while to mention all of them, the chief are in these particular Places; at <HI>Newenham</HI> or <HI>Menham-Reges</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire</HI>: Three which are also of a Medicinal quality, as be∣ing strained through Allum, at <HI>Lutterworth</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire.</HI> Near <HI>Knarisborough</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> the <HI>Well-Drepa,</HI> whose Waters distil from the Rocks that hang over it. At <HI>Hodington-Hill</HI> near <HI>Oxford,</HI> upon the descent of the Hill. At <HI>Boxly Abbey</HI> near <HI>Maidston</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI>; at <HI>Egerton</HI> in the same County. Nor are those Wells and Springs to be forgotten, among the <HI>Memorabilia</HI> of Nature, whose Waters are of a Medi∣cinal virtue; the chief of this nature, not only of <HI>England,</HI> but even of all <HI>Europe,</HI> for the virtue of the Waters, the Magnificence of the Structures about the Wells, and the vast resort to them; are those famous
<PB N="51" REF="31"/>
Bathing Wells, which give denomination to the City <HI>Bath,</HI> and which were first found out by one <HI>Bladud,</HI> who is reckoned in the Catalogue of our Ancient <HI>British</HI> Kings, and renowned in History (if it may be called History, and not rather Histo∣rical Tradition) as well for Philosopher as King. Others there are, whose Waters esteemed for their Purging quality, are ge∣nerally carous'd, as <HI>Ebsham</HI> or <HI>Epsone-Wells</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> those of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> of <HI>Barnet</HI> in <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> and now of late of <HI>North-hall</HI> in the same Shire. Now I can∣not but fancy that there must needs be a very great advantage in this way of Phy∣sick, since those who Evacuate so merrily with so much divertisement, so many as it were together for good Companies sake, no doubt find a more effectual Operation, than those who coop'd up in a Melanchol∣ly Chamber, sup up a mixture of Nauseous and uncouth Ingredients out of an Apothe∣caries Shop: Other places there are, not altogether of no note for their Medicinal Wells, as <HI>Luckington</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> where there is a Well called <HI>Handcocks-Well,</HI> whose greatest Virtue consists in the Cure of sore Eyes; having also this property, that its Water is cold in <HI>Summer</HI> and hot in <HI>Win∣ter: Eckington</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> where
<PB N="52" REF="32"/>
there is lately discovered a Medicinal Well, accounted of great Virtue for several Distempers. <HI>Wallingborough</HI> in <HI>Northamp∣tonshire,</HI> where upon the account of the Waters, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> lay for several weeks. <HI>Lenisham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> six Miles from <HI>London,</HI> where in the year 1651. a Medicinal Wa∣ter was found, which hath been since much frequented. <HI>Dulwich</HI> Wells within three Miles of <HI>London</HI>: And within the City several, but the most noted, that at the Postern-gate by <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> and that called <HI>Crowders-Well</HI> hard by <HI>Cripple-gate. Aleyceston</HI> in <HI>Huntingtonshire,</HI> where there are two small Springs, one whereof being fresh, is accounted good for the Eyes; the other a little Brackish, for Scabs and Le∣prosy. <HI>Buxton</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> where within the compass of 24 Foot, there arise out of a Rock from under a Square Structure of Free-stone 9 Springs, whereof one only is cold, all the rest very warm: But among all these, it would be an unpardonable oversight to pass by unmention'd, that famous Well of St. <HI>Winifrid,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Holy-Well</HI> in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> formerly much frequented, partly by way of Pilgri∣mage, partly for the great Virtue it was reputed to have in the Cure of many Ma∣ladies, through the easie Faith, no doubt,
<PB N="53" REF="32"/>
and fond Credulity of the deluded Vulgar who are always apt to pay high Adoration and ascribe miraculous Cures to the Bodies; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elicks, or any Memorials of persons re∣commended to them for Saints; for here the Tradition goes, that the Virgin Saint <HI>Vinifrid</HI> being here Beheaded, a Fountain immediatly sprung up, as if the Earth be∣wailing her Martyrdom, burst forth into a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood of Tears; and the Pebble-stones at the bottom of the said Fountain being ob∣served to be of a Reddish colour, we are to suppose that they retain to this day, the tincture of the Virgins Blood: Those Springs and Waters that are on the top of high Hills, must be allowed to have something of Rarity in them, in regard to those that are not sufficiently vers'd in the knowledge of natural Causes and Pro∣ductions, it may seem wonderful, that the Water should rise so high above the com∣mon Surface of the Earth: Particularly on the high Hills of <HI>Carnarvanshire,</HI> are two Meers: Also a Spring on the top of <HI>Moilenly∣Hills</HI> in <HI>Denbyshire.</HI> Likewise among the Wonders or Rarities of <HI>England,</HI> may be reckoned those Ditches, which stand yet as Monuments of the Art and Industry of our Forefathers. First, That on <HI>New∣market-heath,</HI> which is commonly called
<PB N="54" REF="33"/>
the <HI>Devils-Ditch.</HI> Secondly, <HI>Wansdike</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> a work of many Miles extent, cast up in memory of a Battle between the <HI>Mercians</HI> and <HI>West-Saxons.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>Clough d'Offa,</HI> or <HI>Offa</HI>'s-<HI>ditch,</HI> a work not infe∣rior to the former mention'd, and much up∣on the same occasion made.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Populacy of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Nation.</HEAD>
<P>THe Populacy of a Nation is best esti∣mated from the number of its Towns and Cities: The Kingdom of <HI>En∣gland</HI> proportionably to its circumference is scarce inferior to any Kingdom or Coun∣try of <HI>Europe</HI> (which is also accounted the the most Populous of all the four parts of the World) except <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Low-Countries</HI>; which last being accounted no bigger in compass than <HI>York-shire,</HI> is judg∣ed to contain as many Towns and Inha∣bited places, as ten times the Circuit there∣of in most other Countries, and to some much superior, particularly <HI>Spain,</HI> late esteem'd the most considerable Monarchy of <HI>Christendom,</HI> and that it continues not so to

this day, we may in a great measure im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te to the paucity of people in that kingdom; for doubtless there is nothing that conduceth more to the Strength, Grandure, Prosperity and Riches of a Nation, than the Populousness thereof, especially where Industry is in the least in∣courag'd, and Idleness discountenanc'd. Wherefore that Nation that will ever hope to flourish, ought to use all means and endeavours possible for the increasing of its People, and to avoid as much as may be all occasions of Depopulation. The prin∣cipal causes of the Dispeopleing of <HI>Spain,</HI> which according to the Testimony of seve∣ral Creditable Authors, hath been Ancient∣ly much better Peopled than at present; have been first the multitude of Monaste∣ries and Religious Prisons, those Recep∣tacles of forc'd Chastity, and as they are ordered Impediments of the Worlds Lawful Increase: Next the Violent Expul∣sion of the <HI>Moors</HI> out of <HI>Spain,</HI> after that by a long establish'd settlement, and being habituated to the same Customs, Manners and Religion, they were become as it were one Body with the rest of the People.

The Cities and Market-Towns of <HI>England,</HI> are in num∣ber 607. to which the rest of the Burrough Towns, that is, such as send Burgesses to Parliament, and all the Inha∣bited Villages (whereof some are conder∣able) being added, make above 10 times the number, so that all the Parishes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> are reckon'd 9285. and doubt∣less within the said circumference, which is generally computed to be about 1352 Miles, might be very well comprehended five times as many Towns or Places of Ha∣bitation, if all the Forrests, Chaces, and unimproved vast Heaths and Commons, were taken in and improved to the best advantage.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondred at, that next to being born under a Happy Climate, the living under a Happy Government, the greatest advantage and Strength of a People, is to be numerous, proportionably to the extent of Territory they possess. Since in the first place it is apparent enough, that in a well Inhabited City, the People must needs be so much the better able to defend themselves from any Force or Op∣position. Next, if it be a place of any Trade, take any particular number of what
<PB N="57" REF="34"/>
Trade soever, and it is not to be imagin'd that they should be e're a whit the poorer, but rather the richer, than if the Inha∣bitants had been fewer: For admit them of the same Trade or Imployment, a profi∣table and corresponsible Trade is the more lively and vigorously carried on by many hands; and suppose them of several Occu∣pations, the circulation of Money from the one to other, helps all in general. Though 'tis true, that in a straggling Town or City, whose parts lye disjoyn'd and far asunder; the people however considerable in num∣ber, cannot be so assistant to each other in mutual Aid, Society or Commerce, as in a regular and well compacted City: So likewise in a Kingdom, that Prince who hath never so large an Empire, yet if thin∣ly Peopled, or divided into several parts remotely distant, and interrupted from mutual intercourse by long Voyages of Land and Sea, cannot be look'd upon as so powerful a Prince, as he that hath the like number of People in one intire and united Dominion. Certainly no Monarch of the World, much less of <HI>Christendom,</HI> (who∣ever he be that hath added most to his Empire by never so many new made Con∣quests) can pretend to so large a share or portion of the Earth, as the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="35"/>
who nevertheless (as the transactions of a few late past years have made appear,) hath born but his fourth part with other Princes and States, in opposition to a Prince far inferior to him in Jurisdiction; and what should be the reason of this, but that his Dominions lye so remote from each other, and his Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> which his Re∣sidence there chiefly enables, is the least Peopled of all the rest, and his Viceroys of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI> (the possession whereof hath been main occasion of Impoverishing <HI>Spain</HI> of its people) are in effect, setting aside the Title, as great Kings as himself; nor much less are those of <HI>Naples, Sicily, Millain,</HI> and what remains of <HI>Flanders,</HI> so that he seems in reality King of <HI>Spain</HI> alone, and of the rest of his Dominions, but in Title only: And to come a little nearer the matter, if all the Kings Subjects in <HI>New-England, Virginia, Maryland,</HI> &amp;c. were planted in those unpeopled Regions of this Island (their Native Soyl) which are more than large enough to receive them, there is no doubt to be made, but that they would be more capable of serving their King, than they can possibly be at such a distance, thus transplanted to the other end of the World: To be short, no Rational man will deny, but that that
<PB N="59" REF="35"/>
Prince, who from a Territory no larger than the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> is able to bring 100000 men into the field, is no less Potent than he who from a Territory 20 times as large is able to raise a not much greater number; and so much the more, by how much he levies them with less Trouble and Charge. That Soveraign Conquers best, who wins the hearts of his people by Mo∣deration, Justice, good Government, and wholsome Laws. He best plants Colonies, who maintains a flourishing Trade to Forraign parts; he best inlarges his Ter∣ritory, who husbands his People to the best advantage, and consults best for their Preservation and Increase; hereby approv∣ing himself all this while a true Christian Prince, not in Name only, but in reality no less; and upon this score, let the World judge, whether our <HI>Defensor Fidei</HI> have not a just Title to that of <HI>Christianissimus</HI> also. When as for any Potentate or Grandee of the World, Pontifical or other∣wise, to grasp at Power and Empire by War, Bloodshed and Rapine, though under never so spacious a pretence, even propoga∣ting the Faith it self, and at the same time to take upon him the Name of Christian, must needs be the highest affront to Hea∣ven, and shame to Religion imaginable.
<PB N="60" REF="36"/>
The Stile of Christian Cut-throat, (for that must necessarily follow) implying a cnntradiction not to be reconcil'd by all the art of Sopistry and Jesuitism; since he that hath but heard of the Christian Re∣ligion, cannot be ignorant that Peace and Charity are the very root and foundation of Christianity, and that Religion under what Title soever, which is otherwise grounded, is to be abhorr'd by all sober men. The <HI>Creator</HI> said to the Earth at the beginning, Increase and be Replenish'd: The <HI>Destroyer</HI> hath been saying to the same Earth from the beginning, from Age to Age; be ruin'd, laid wast and Dispeopled by humane Slaughter. Now how far the parallel will hold between the greater, and Man the lesser World, as to the necessity of Purging and Bleeding; and whether it be so wholsom, as some would have us think, that the superfluous blood of the World should be let out by the Phlebotomy of War, we shall wave the inquiry at this present; only I am of opinion, that it would be better to leave the Physicking of the World to the great Physitian there∣of, than that man upon man should so often practice his Fatal Chyrurgery. There is sufficient reason to believe that those frequent Inundations of People, those nu∣merous
<PB N="61" REF="36"/>
swarms of <HI>Cimbrians, Teutones, Lon∣gobards, Huns, Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> which <HI>Scythia</HI> in former times pour'd out into the milder Regions of <HI>Europe,</HI> were not so much the Luxuriance and off-scouring of an over-peopled Nation, (since not any one denomination of Country besides, takes up so large a part of the earth, or hath so many vast unhabited Vacancies) but a kind of agreement among certain numbers of men to carve themselves out better Commons than their own Country afforded; and throw off the <HI>Scythian</HI> Frost and roughness, by the Warm Sun-shine of <HI>Gallia, Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Now to come closer to the design of our Discourse: Three things are to be considered. First, Whether this Nation have not been in former Ages more Populous than at present. Next, what the occasion of this Dispopulation hath been. Lastly, The means of restoration to pristine Populacy, or at least of Replenishment in some degree. The first consideration is answered by the second: There is no que∣stion to be made, but that the complicated Invasions of <HI>Romans, Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> (especially the last so dreadfully Barbarous) was the Destruction of a World of People, and the Demolishment of many Towns and Cities; and after the <HI>Norman</HI> Con∣quest,
<PB N="62" REF="37"/>
the Bloody Civil Wars amongst us; first of the Barons, next of the two Roses: As for the <HI>Norman</HI> Invasion it self, it oc∣casion'd indeed no great matter of De∣vastation, since except a few inconsiderable Insurrections that happen'd afterwards, the business was decided by the dint of one Battle, and happily the Conqueror had not been sorry, had more of the <HI>English</HI> fallen in that quarrel; since, like a true Step∣father and Foraign Invader, more than like a Native Father of the Country, he could find in his heart to lay waste 28 Towns and Villages, to make a large ha∣bitation for wild Beasts. The last and main consideration, is how to repair this loss of People; shall we call the <HI>English</HI> of <HI>America</HI> back to their Native Soyl? or shall we invite the Industrious, or the Distressed of other Nations to come over and live among us? or shall we indeavour to People the Na∣tion better with those People, if I may so call them, we have already; that is, turn Drones into Bees, and two Legg'd Cattle into Men? The first I take altogether to be Impracticable and Irrational to go about; for it would be an endless thing for such mul∣titudes of People to unfix themselves from their setled Imploys and Habitations, and to be put to remove their Effects back to a
<PB N="63" REF="37"/>
Country now grown as strange and un∣couth to them, as any other Foraign Na∣tion. The second, according to my poor judgment, cannot be disadvantageous to this Kingdom, could it be well compas'd and well manag'd, so as to give no distaste to the present Inhabitants; for it hath been a general and frequent Complaint, in my hearing, among some Tradesmen of <HI>London,</HI> that Foraigners (especially these <HI>French</HI> Dogs, as they stile them) come over, settle themselves among us, and eat the Bread out of our Mouths. Nevertheless it is certain, that in many Towns of <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Canterbury, Norwich,</HI> &amp;c. many Families of Foraigners are well setled, exercise the Epidemick Trade of those Places peaceably and prosperously enough, and without envy or disturbance. Hospitality is a certain evidence of a good Nature and Generous Inclination; and it hath been formerly, and doubtless still is in a great measure, the particular Credit of the <HI>English</HI> Gentry, to keep Plentiful Houses, on purpose to En∣tertain Strangers, give Shelter to benighted Travellers, and Succour all persons in Distress: And as among particular per∣sons, no man but an Indigent Wretch, or Ill-natur'd Churl, will deny Relief to a person, that through real and remediless
<PB N="64" REF="38"/>
want makes application to him. So like∣wise among Nations, that People that re∣fuseth the Accomodation of their Country to their supplicant Neighbours, who un∣justly Banished their own Native Land, or driven, out by Persecution and Tyranny, fly to them for Refuge, must needs be the Inhabitants of a Beggarly and Unhospitable Soyl, or be themselves a sort of Inhumane and Savage-Bores. Our Kingdom, God be thanked, is sufficiently Fertile; our Na∣tives not accounted Ill-natured, and for Room we have not only to spare, but within the whole Circuit of <HI>England</HI> enough, as we have said before, to con∣tain a far greater power of People twice, if not thrice the number: So that an ac∣cession of peaceable Strangers can be no injury, may be a considerable benefit to us; so that in being Charitable to others, we shall be no losers our selves; and never was there so important and seasonable an occa∣sion offered as now, for the receiving of Foraigners among us; since never did any persecuted people so want our Entertain∣men and Succour, as at this time, these our Protestant Neighbours, who in their own Native Country, and among the Professors of Christianity, are denyed that Protecti∣on, which living peaceably, they could not
<PB N="65" REF="38"/>
doubt of among the severest of <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Ethnicks</HI>; and all this for no other rea∣son, then denying to fall down before the obtruded Idol, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> were dealt with in the days of the Tyrant <HI>Nebuchad∣nezzar</HI>: But by Divine Providence it falls out happily to be at a time that <HI>England</HI> is govern'd by the most Just and Benevo∣lent of Princes; who out of his Concern∣ment for the Protestant Religion, and that innate Generosity and Clemency where∣with he delights to oblige all mankind, hath by an Order of Councel of the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> of <HI>September</HI> this present year 1681. pro∣mised all those that shall come over, such ample Priviledges and Immunities, as will much soften and allay their present Af∣flictions, and in a great measure compen∣sate for their being forc'd to abandon their Native habitations. The last cannot be reasonably judg'd unfeasible, and is certain∣ly the most absolutely necessary, since those many thousands of Unimployed persons, burthens of the earth, who presume they were only born to Eat and Drink, are no better than so many Ciphers, being per∣fectly lost to their Country: Nay which is worse, they may justly be reckoned as so many Vermine and Noxious Animals; for Idleness it self cannot always subsist in its
<PB N="66" REF="39"/>
own station, but oftentimes is forc'd up∣on Action, but 'tis the worst part of Action, Mischief. As admit a Nation never so thinly Inhabited, and yet a Million of those Inhabitants prove utterly useless and unprofitable, that Nation may well be said to be too Populous by that Million: Inso∣much as Cut-purse, Pick-pocket, House-breaker, Highway-man, and whatever be∣sides can be imagin'd mischievous, are but the several Metamorphoses of an Idle Liver; and thus Idleness tends to a more fatal kind of Depopulation: The unworking person indeed, who in some sence may be said to be no person, but dead to the service of his Country, yet is capable of being quickned and inspir'd with the life of Action; but the worker of Iniquity, who is commonly the result of the unworking Person, takes courses which tend to an irrevivable Destruction. The first is but that Malefactor in <HI>Posse,</HI> which the Thief and Robber is in <HI>Esse</HI>; and doubtless were the Potential Maleficence, which is Idle∣ness, severely inquired into, and regulated by the Discipline of Law and Government, so many of the Kings Subjects would not yearly at every Session and Assize, as Essen∣tial Malefactors, be made sad Examples of Justice, and cut off from the Land of
<PB N="67" REF="39"/>
the Living, to which in this World there is no return. But what hath been said all this while of the unworking Person, (whom to compel to work, that he may be kept from Starving, and restrain from Stealing, that he may be restrained from the Gallows, is no Injurious, but Cha∣ritable part of a Magistrate) it is to be understood only of those narrow Soul'd Loiterers, who being not worth a Groat in the World, choose rather to go squan∣dring up and down Beg, Filch and be Lowsy, than Honestly to get their Bread by clean∣ly Industry and wholesome Labour: Whereas for him that hath enough to Live on, who shall hinder him, if he please and have the Conscience, to be Idle and good for nothing at his own Charges: As for those who are great in Money, Lands, or High Offices, great also are their Priviledges; for the World hath ge∣nerally a very great favour and respect for such as flourish and are prosperous in it, (as well as contempt for the Poor and Unfortunate) and except they shall unfor∣tunately happen to become Envy'd-Fa∣vourites, will be apt to have a favourable excuse for whatsoever is either omitted or committed by them. However, there is a real merit that cannot be denyed them,
<PB N="68" REF="40"/>
which is, that they have wherewithal to be serviceable to their King and Country: A Rich man, meerly as a Rich man, must needs be acknowledged a useful person in his Generation, especially if his Heart be answerable to his Purse, or however where something is to be had, there is a possibility of obtaining: On the other side, though it be just and rational to give Law to those who will not give Law to themselves, to compel men to their own as well as the publick good, to work that they may not Starve, to do well, that they may not suffer for doing ill. It is not yet so con∣sonant to reason, that any one should be forc'd to performance, though of things never so just, above Ability, or to make satisfactions out of nothing. That the Idle and Industrious alike, to satisfie the rigorous Justice of a Self-loving Creditor, should for being Idle or Unfortunate, be condemned to perpetual Idleness and Mis∣fortune, and for no other cause, than not working Impossibilities, be constrain'd to lie starving and stinking to death in a loathsom Gaol, is a piece of Judiciality. I do not understand, and I verily believe, that it is no less unjust, for any one to be Cruel and Rigorous in the exacting of his <HI>Own</HI> from him that <HI>Hath</HI> not, than for
<PB N="69" REF="40"/>
him that <HI>Hath,</HI> to forbear the payment of what he <HI>Owes</HI>; who also, if not willing of himself, may and ought to be made so by force and rigour: Which may be in∣flicted otherwise than by Confinement, for a Prison is least a punishment to those that most deserve it. To conclude, a too rigorous procedure either to Death or Im∣prisonment, seems an over-acting in Justice, and as it were tending much alike to∣wards a kind of Depopulation; there be∣ing no great difference between not to be at all, and not to be at Liberty; the first totally, the second after a manner, depriv∣ing the World of those whose Lives and Liberties might happily have been usefully enough, spar'd for the Commonwealth.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Manufactures of England.</HEAD>
<P>MAnufacture is to the Body Politick, what Exercise is to the Body Na∣tural, <HI>viz.</HI> Prosperity to the one, Health and Soundness to the other; Ildleness be∣ing alike pernicious to both, and causing to both alike Debauchery of Manners, Distemper and Beggary. There are few Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> as well a mother parts of the World, wherein some particular Towns are not particularly Eminent for some or other Manufacture, as in <HI>Anda∣lusia</HI> a Province of <HI>Spain, Corduba</HI> for the curious Dressing of Leather, which is thence called <HI>Cordovan-Leather</HI>; in <HI>Biscaia Bilboa</HI> for the making of excellent Temper'd Blades, <HI>Faenza</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> for fine Earthen Ware, <HI>Venice</HI> for that rare sort of Drinking Glasses, which are thence called <HI>Venice-Glasses</HI>; which Art of Glass-making, is by a late Discovery from thence, Im∣prov'd to a very great heigth in <HI>England,</HI> though we cannot bring Glasses to that perfection, for want of those Materials
<PB N="71" REF="41"/>
which are only to be had in those, <HI>viz.</HI> two sorts of Plants called <HI>Gazul</HI> and <HI>Subit,</HI> out of whose Liquified Ashes the right <HI>Venice-Glasses</HI> are blown. The most ge∣neral Manufacture of <HI>England,</HI> is that which of all others is certainly the most useful and profitable, and which from Ancient time hath in a measure conduc'd to the Wealth and flourishing Estate of the Nation; that is to say, the Woollen Manu∣facture, or the making of Woollen Cloths or Stuffs, which being encourag'd and rightly manag'd, is the chief prop of our Trade and Commerce, and (till the Fishery be set up, according to the Pro∣posals of several Worthy Persons) the chief Support and Honest Maintenance of the Poor, whom could there be work enough found out universally to imploy, it would be a happy means to take off that Lewd and Sordid course of Vagabond Beg∣ging, which introduces all those Thievish and unlawful practices, that bring so many daily to shameful and untimely ends. The first Broadcloth (so called, because of the Broad-Looms wherein it was wrought) made in <HI>England,</HI> is said to have been wrought by <HI>Jack</HI> of <HI>Newbury,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. The first famous Clothiers were the <HI>Webscloths</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="42"/>
and <HI>Clutterbucks</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire.</HI> For this In∣genious and profitable Art or Mystery of La∣nifice or Woollen-work, there is no place in <HI>England</HI> more fam'd than the City of <HI>Nor∣wich,</HI> which hath for a long time flourish'd by the making of Worsted-Stuffs, which be∣ing wrought here more Curiously than elsewhere, are thence called <HI>Nerwich-Stuffs</HI>; which Work hath been brought to the greater perfection, by the Industry of se∣veral <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Families, who have been here planted for several years. No Nation ever loseth, but gets by the Trans∣plantation of Industrious Foraigners, who by Interest and Converse, soon become one with the People among whom they Inhabit. The Stuffs here vended (the chief Trade whereof, as also of Stockings, is to <HI>London</HI>) are esteemed at 100000 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> which Stuffs are under the Go∣vernment of two Companies, the <HI>Worsted</HI> Company, and the <HI>Russel</HI> Company. The Stockings at 60000 <HI>l. per annum.</HI> But there is another Town in this County, which being called <HI>Worsted,</HI> seems to have been the first noted place wherein these Stuffs were substantially made, in regard they thence took their denomination. <HI>Kidderminster</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire</HI> drives a very Trade in the making of certain Stuffs,
<PB N="73" REF="42"/>
which are thence called <HI>Kidderminster-Stuffs</HI>; and in the same Shire the City of <HI>Worcester</HI> it self: And also <HI>Malmsbury</HI> for Woollen-Cloth. In <HI>Warwick-shire, Coventry</HI>; In <HI>Lancashire, Manchester</HI> is much Enrich'd by the Industry of the Inhabitants, in mak∣ing Cloth of Linnen and Woollen. <HI>Taun∣ton</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire</HI> drives so great a Trade in Mixt and White-Serges, that there are said to be sent up Weekly to <HI>London</HI> and other places, no less than 700 pieces, a sort of them, besides a sort of course Bays; in the making whereof, there are Weekly im∣ployed no less than 8500 persons. No less doth <HI>Wakefield</HI> in the <HI>West-riding</HI> of <HI>York-shire; Leeds</HI> also in the same County is accounted a Wealthy. Town, by reason of its Cloath∣ing. <HI>Exeter</HI> by the quantity of Serges there made, returns to <HI>London</HI> a 10000 <HI>l.</HI> a Week. <HI>Stroud</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> is a Town not only full of Rich Clothiers, but is also particularly Eminent for the Dying of Cloths, by reason of the peculiar quality of the Water for that purpose: <HI>Teuxbury</HI> also in the same County, is very Rich in Clothing: Likewise <HI>Sudbury</HI> or <HI>South∣bourg</HI> in <HI>Suffolk; Hadly</HI> in the same County. <HI>Reading</HI> in <HI>Bark-shire,</HI> which through the greatness of its Trade, is a very Wealthy Town; and <HI>Newbury</HI> in the
<PB N="74" REF="43"/>
same County. So likewise <HI>Shirburn</HI> in <HI>Dorcetshire,</HI> upon the same account: And also in <HI>Essex, Colchester, Dedham, Coxal,</HI> and other places, abound in Bays, Says, and other new Drapery. <HI>Appleby</HI> in <HI>Cumberland</HI> is no less Eminent for its strong Castle, and for being the place where the Assizes for the County are held, than for its great Cloth Manufacture; the like is <HI>Kendal</HI> in the same County.</P>
<P>Among the woollen Manufacture of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> may be reckon'd the weaving and knitting of Stockings, the use of which woven and knit Stockings hath not been in this Nation longer than about the begin∣ning of K. <HI>James</HI>'s Reign: It being ve∣ry memorable what D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Fuller</HI> relates of one <HI>William Rider,</HI> an Apprentice at the foot of <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, over against S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Magnes</HI>-Church, who seeing in the House of an <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> Merchant a pair of knit worsted Stock∣ings, which he brought from <HI>Mantua,</HI> and taking special observation of them, made a pair exactly like them, which he presented to <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and they are said to be the first of that sort worn in <HI>England,</HI> and thence-forward they became more and more in use; so that for many years they have been very much, and are now altogether worn, and are a great part
<PB N="75" REF="43"/>
of the Trade in most Places where there is any thing of woollen Manufacture, especi∣ally at <HI>Norwich</HI>; yet Jersie Stockings have for a long time had a particular name. The Next Place may properly be allow'd to our making of Bone-lace, which is the chief of the Ornamentals worn in this Nation, though not so totally as before the Needle-works came in fashion, which though brought to great perfection, yet have ob∣tain'd so much the less esteem, by how much those of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the Points <HI>de Venice</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Larron</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> came more in fashion, as all foreign Artifices usu∣ally (especially the <HI>French</HI>) have ever the chiefest vogue among our Gallants. So general is this Manufacture in many Parts of <HI>England,</HI> that the Poor of whole Towns are almost totally imploy'd, and in a great measure maintain'd thereby: Particularly, <HI>Honiton</HI> in <HI>Devonshire</HI> is a noted Town for his sort of Workmanship; as likewise <HI>Sa∣lisbury</HI> and <HI>Marlborough</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire, Ouldny</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire, Amersham</HI> and <HI>Chesham</HI> in the same Shire, <HI>Blandford</HI> in <HI>Dorcetshire</HI>; which last Place hath been famous also for making of Band-strings, and now Point-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aces, it is said, are much made there. It is observ'd, that the only Thread made in <HI>England,</HI> till within a few years, was at <HI>Maidstone</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="44"/>Besides the Cottons of <HI>Manchester,</HI> the Tickin, Pins, Points and Laces of that Place, have been thought not unworthy to be mention'd by several of <HI>England</HI>'s Topo∣graphers; so likewise the Gloves, Purses and leathern Points of <HI>Congleton,</HI> a Market Town of <HI>Cheshire</HI>; the Pins of <HI>Aberford</HI> in <HI>York-shire.</HI> The making of Ropes and Ca∣bles for Ships was heretofore not onely e∣specially eminent at <HI>Birtport</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire</HI> above all other places, but also so highly approv'd for the goodness and curiosity of the Workmanship, that a Statute is said to have been made for a time, ordaining that no Ropes or Cables for the King's Ships should be made any where else; but that Act appears to have been long since out of date, for there are great Rope-yards be∣longing to all the Ship-docks of <HI>England,</HI> particularly at <HI>Deptford</HI> there are very fa∣mous and large ones.</P>
<P>Smiths-work, whatever it is at present, hath been heretofore peculiarly attributed to the Artists of <HI>Salisbury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire, Bre∣micham</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire, Chedder</HI> in <HI>Somer∣setshire, Sheffield</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire, Malton</HI> in the same Shire, and <HI>Walsal</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire</HI>; particularly <HI>Salisbury</HI> is commended for Razors; <HI>Bremicham</HI> and <HI>Sheffield</HI> for Blades of Knives; <HI>Chedder</HI> for Teasels or Instru∣ments
<PB N="77" REF="44"/>
used in the dressing of Cloth; <HI>Mal∣ton</HI> for Instruments used in Husbandry; and <HI>Walsal</HI> for Bits and Snaffles for Horses; moreover this last Town is noted as well for Pewterers as Smiths. But by the way, the mention of Knives hath brought to mind a just occasion of admiration, that is, since the <HI>English</HI> have been observ'd, and not without just cause, to be a good stout eating People, there being more substantial Joynts of Beef and Mutton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> consum'd among us, than perhaps in any part of the World besides, how it should come to pass, that we should be so tardy in the Art of Knife-making; or what Invention we had in former days, to avoid those Indecencies at the Table, which the want of Knives must in all likelihood be the cause of: For it is credibly reported, that one <HI>Thomas Matthews</HI> living on <HI>Fleet</HI>-bridge, was the first that made Knives in <HI>England,</HI> which was in the 5<SUP>th</SUP> year of the Reign of Q. <HI>Eli∣zabeth.</HI></P>
<P>The best Tobacco-pipes, for neatness of shape and form, and for a curious shining gloss, are made at <HI>Ambresbury,</HI> vulgarly call'd <HI>Emsbury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> about a mile or two from <HI>Stonehenge</HI>; they are commonly call'd Gantlet-Pipes (having the mark of a Gantlet impress'd on the flat bottom of the
<PB N="78" REF="45"/>
Bowl) from M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Hugh Gantlet,</HI> who was the first that brought them to this perfecti∣on.</P>
<P>There are also several edible and potable Works of Art, which may in my opinion properly enough come under the Head of <HI>English</HI> Manufactures. The Coagulation of Milk into the Consistence of Cheese, is said to have been the first Invention of the <HI>Osci,</HI> an ancient People of <HI>Italy</HI>; but whence or from whomsoever proceeding, this sort of artificial Food is the most com∣mon and universal, in all Parts of the World where the most rational and civil way of Eating is in use. Of all the Shires of <HI>England, Cheshire</HI> for this kind of Edible, may, I judge, be allow'd the Bays, above all other Parts, at least of this Kingdom; and for ought I know, a true <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheese, if rightly valu'd, may stand in competition with the Parmesan of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Angelot of <HI>France,</HI> and the Full-moon of <HI>Holland,</HI> only with this pre-eminence reser∣ved to the last, that but for the bigness, it might serve as well for the Bowling-green as the Table. <HI>Suffolk</HI> in this particular challenges the next place, but doubtless in respect rather of quantity than quality; for this County furnishes with Cheeses not on∣ly several other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> but also

<HI>Spain, France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>; a lean Traveller may possibly be thought able to endure a long Journey better than one that's plump and fat. These are the two principal Cheese-Counties of <HI>England</HI>; but in other Counties, this Pretension is fixt to particu∣lar Places, as in <HI>Somersetshire</HI> to <HI>Chedder</HI> be∣fore-mention'd, the Cheeses whereof are of that repute, as to be frequently, preferr'd even before those of <HI>Cheshire</HI>; Opinion and Imagination are two great things.</P>
<P>In <HI>Warwickshire, Banbury</HI> hath a Name both for Cheeses and Cakes, the justifica∣tion of which Name is best left to the ex∣perienc'd taster of both. For Sugar'd-Cakes, <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> is without controversie allow'd to bear away the Bell from all other Places. But to save the Reputation of the Cake-makers of other Parts, this Super-ex∣cellence is attributed to the nature of the <HI>Severn</HI>-water in that Place. Other Places there are that challenge their Peculiars of this nature, but the most proverbially emi∣nent are the Whitepot of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and Dumpling of <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>Nor must the Potables of <HI>England</HI> be al∣together forgotten. For Ale, <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> and particularly <HI>Derby</HI>-Town; also <HI>Hull, Northdown,</HI> and <HI>Sandbitch,</HI> and <HI>Weably</HI> afore-mention'd, are most especially fam'd;
<PB N="80" REF="46"/>
for Sider, all <HI>Gloucestershire, Worcestershire</HI> and <HI>Herefordshire</HI>; for Metheglin, <HI>Shrop∣shire, Herefordshire,</HI> and some Parts of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>To the Manufactury of <HI>England,</HI> may not unfitly be added an account of those cu∣rious Arts and Inventions, which are now flourishing in this Nation, whether newly, or for some Ages last past. And among these, the first and principal is the excel∣lent, and by some highly applauded, and by others most condemned, Art of Print∣ting. This noble Invention, in many re∣spects useful, and no way so pernicious as some would have it thought, was first ex∣ercis'd by <HI>William Caxton</HI> Mercer, who in the Reign of K. <HI>Edw.</HI> the IV. kept his Printing-house in <HI>Westminster</HI>-Abbey, by the permission of <HI>Simon Islip</HI> Abbot of <HI>West∣minster</HI>; and the first Book set forth, some say, was <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>Offices</HI>; others say, a Book treating of the way of playing the Game at Chess.</P>
<P>The next Invention appearing here among us, must be allow'd little less inge∣nious than the former, but wonderfully more capable of doing mischief, I mean, the truly black Art of Gunpowder, the swarthy Invention of a swarthy <HI>Monk,</HI> and possibly by the Inspiration of the Prince of
<PB N="81" REF="46"/>
Darkness. Yet one thing is worthy to be observ'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that since the discovery of this gloomy Drug, whatever destruction hath been committed by whole-sale, some∣thing of amends hath been made by retail: For whereas in former Times, when the Bow, Lance and Javelin were in use, Histo∣ry makes nothing of 40 or 50000 slain in the Field; now that the Musket, Dragoon and Pistol came in fashion (even with the Cannon to boot) it is a great matter to hear of the fall of 10 or 20000. besides, as a Member sometimes is not ill lost to save a Man, so in greater Bodies, a House may be better spar'd than a whole Street or Town, which deliverance nothing but Gunpowder can effect. But then against this benefit may be oppos'd the springing of Mines, to blow up Castles, Forts and Cittadels, meerly for destructions sake.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, and it appears from Histories, that the Chariot hath been known in <HI>England</HI> as well as in other Parts of the World time out of mind; but the use of those portable Houses call'd Coaches, which at this day being increas'd to a vast multitude, make such a clutter in the Streets of <HI>London,</HI> to the great disturbance of the poor Foot-Passenger, is said to have first commenc'd about the year 1556. till
<PB N="82" REF="47"/>
when, 'tis to be presum'd, that great Per∣sons seldom stirr'd out but in fair weather, whereas now all Seasons for Visits are alike; otherwise the Cavalcade of Princes and Nobles on Horseback, may doubtless afford the Beholder as comely a Spectacle as a long train of Coaches. Together with the Coach, or not long after, I guess, came in the Coaches Epitome, the Sedan, more elegantly styl'd a Chair, a much more easie sort of passage, as perform'd not by draught but carriage, and that by the more rational sort of Animal. But there is another kind of moving Domicil of much later date, call'd a Calesh, which seems like a Coach cut off in the middle, wherein commonly the Driver and the Driven is one and the self-same person.</P>
<P>Watches, and other horary Motions of that nature, it is certain, came out of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and according to the best conjecture, somewhat more than a 100 years since. The principal Artists of this kind menti∣on'd are <HI>Janus Torrianellus,</HI> and <HI>Cornelius van Drebble</HI>; but since all kind of automa∣tous Motions by Clock-work have been wonderfully improv'd by those of our own Nation, particularly M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Davie Mell,</HI> besides his excellent judgement and fancy in Musi∣cal Compositions, and his great perfor∣mance
<PB N="83" REF="47"/>
on the Violin, above all others of his Time, (for within these 20 years, the very quintessence of that Instruments Mu∣sick hath been extracted, as being chiefly in fashion) was so prodigious an Artist in all Mechanick Motions by Clock-work, that if any one since hath equall'd him in Art, he hath at least fallen short in Fame.</P>
<P>But of all Inventions of this kind, the <HI>Pendulum</HI> of latest date, is also of greatest curiosity and use, being generally acknow∣ledg'd the Design of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hook,</HI> Fellow of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> a Person of much Esteem among the Learned and Vertuous, for his Mathematical and Mechanick Improve∣ments, however M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Oldenburg,</HI> late Secre∣tary to the said <HI>Society,</HI> made some Dispute in this Matter, as asserting it of <HI>German</HI> Original.</P>
<P>All sorts of Optick Glasses and Tubes, as the Telescope, the Invention of the noble <HI>Galileo,</HI> the Microscope, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been of late years wonderfully improv'd, especially by the Directions of the fore-mention'd M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hook,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Flamstead,</HI> and others of this most renowned <HI>Fellowship.</HI> But the first fa∣mous Artificer of these Tubes and Glasses, was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Reeves</HI> in <HI>Long-acre,</HI> after whom M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Cock</HI> hath continued the Imployment with prosperous success and approbation.

The Barometer, Thermometer, Hydroscope, and such like Contrivances, for the disco∣very of the Change of Weather, have cer∣tainly been the result of those unwearied Endeavours and Enquiries, that have been made into the depth of Natural Knowledg, since the foundation of this Noble <HI>Society.</HI> And among the sagacious Enquirers into Meteorological Philosophy, D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Goad,</HI> late Master of <HI>Merchant-Taylors</HI>-School, must be allow'd a principal place.</P>
<P>But for the Air-Pump, the rarest Inven∣tion ever found out for the proof of a <HI>Vacu∣um in rerum Natura,</HI> it particularly owns the Honourable <HI>Robert Boil</HI> its Inventor, who by his many Writings and Inventions, hath been a Worthy Contributor to the Ad∣vancement of Experimental Philosophy.</P>
<P>The Art of Torning, as it appears to have been not much less ancient in the World than Sculpture it self, so doubtless it is not very Modern in this Nation. But that curious Improvement of Torning, call'd the Rose-work, doubtless claims here but an Ages Antiquity. The first celebra∣ted Person for Work of this nature, was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Reeve,</HI> the Brother of the above-men∣tion'd Artist in Optick Glasses. And though this sort of Work hath since been very frequent among us, yet I cannot omit
<PB N="85" REF="48"/>
the mention of a Person, who from his own natural Fancy and Ingenuity, hath arriv'd to that perfection, as well in this as all manner of Torning else, that he is judg'd by knowing Persons not to be exceeded, if equall'd, by any that have been bred up to the Art, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Gearie,</HI> living in S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Anns</HI>-Lane in <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>Our Sculpture in Stone appears plainly not to be of Modern Invention or Discove∣ry in this Nation, by the delicate Workman∣ship in several of our Cathedrals and other Churches, and in the Schools at <HI>Oxford</HI>; and at this present time it is not any way diminish'd, but rather improv'd by the Art and Industry of several eminent Men, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pierce,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Latham,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pennel,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for Carving in Wood, never was any thing in <HI>England</HI> seen more curious and exquisite, than the Workmanship of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Gibbons,</HI> his Majesty's Carver, and a great Contributer to the Ornaments of the Royal Palace at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>Graving in Copper seems not to have been brought to any perfection in <HI>England</HI> till this present Age. The first Person ve∣ry eminent among us in this Art was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Faithorn,</HI> now living in <HI>Black-fri∣ers</HI>; and since there have sprung up several other ingenuous Artists in this kind, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="49"/>
M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Loggan,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>White,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sherwin,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The best for Etching, not only in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but perhaps in any other Parts, was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wenceslaus Hollar,</HI> who died here not many years since.</P>
<P>But that rough sort of Graving, or ra∣ther pecking upon Copper, call'd <HI>Mezzo Tinto,</HI> hath been us'd but lately, being ei∣ther the Design or Encouragement of his late Highness Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI></P>
<P>There is also a peculiar Art in the graving of written Letters from the Copies of the most exact writing-Masters. The first emi∣nent in this way was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Cocker,</HI> who was also himself a writing-Master, to whom, others that have succeeded, have not been inferiour; as M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Sturt,</HI> who grav'd the Copies of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Aires</HI>; and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Elder,</HI> who grav'd an ingenious Piece, entituled, <HI>Bra∣chyarithmia,</HI> of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edw. Noon,</HI> Teacher of Writing and Accounts, at the <HI>Hand</HI> and <HI>Pen</HI> in <HI>Maiden-lane</HI> in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
<P>For Graving in Steel, never was any Man so famous in <HI>England</HI> as M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Rawlins,</HI> last Graver of the <HI>Mint</HI> both to his late and to his present Majesty; the grand Excellency of whose Art was, his graving the Effigies of any one, true and exact upon a small Letter-Seal.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="49"/>As for Painting, our Nation can boast nothing like the Works of the great Sir <HI>Anthony Vandike,</HI> who though born a Fo∣reigner, died an Englishman. Nor hath he wanted several famous Successors; as <HI>Dobson, Fuller, Walker, Lillie, Greenhill,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The first Person famous among us for Painting in Miniature, was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Oliver</HI>; af∣ter whom, <HI>Francis Clein</HI> and his Brother <HI>John</HI> had been the Prodigies of the Age, had they lived. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Cooper</HI>'s loss comes next to be lamented; the Persons living are M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Gibson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Flattman,</HI> &amp;c. For Crayons or dry Colours, Mr. <HI>Ashfield,</HI> lately deceas'd.</P>
<P>Scene-Paintings and Machines have not been known in <HI>England</HI> till within these 20 years; and the only eminent Men in this kind have been Mr. <HI>Streeter,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ste∣venson,</HI> some years since deceased.</P>
<P>In Musick, it would be too tedious to determine, whether the Improvement or Alteration hath been greater. Certain it is, that several old <HI>English</HI> Instruments are laid aside; as the Orpharian, the Poly∣phone, an Instrument surely not to be de∣spis'd, considering its rare Structure, and the Esteem had of it by learned and there∣fore most judiciously Musical Persons of this Age, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Prujean,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Rugely.</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="50"/>
The Stump, whereon about, an Age ago <HI>Andrew Mark</HI> was famous for his rare per∣formance. The Bandore, the Ghittern, Cittern, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The treble Viol also is much out of doors, since the Violin came so much in request. The Base and Lyra Viol, in the making whereof, <HI>Wroth</HI> was without dispute the best Workman that ever wrought, keep pretty well in repute, espe∣cially the first, in regard it cannot well be wanted in Consort. Nor did ever any Age produce such wonderful Performers upon this Instrument as this present Age; particularly, <HI>Pol-wheel, Theodore Stephkins</HI> deceas'd, his Son <HI>Frederick,</HI> Mr. <HI>Young,</HI> Sir <HI>John Bolls</HI> of <HI>Scampton</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> Mr. <HI>Roger l'Estrange,</HI> Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gregory,</HI> &amp;c. The Lute is not wholly laid aside, but within these 20 or 30 years much neglect∣ed to what it was formerly, notwithstand∣ing the great Improvement of this Instru∣ment among us within a 100 years, by reason of the diversity of Tunings receiv'd from <HI>France,</HI> some of whose best Lute-Ma∣sters brought over not only these Harp-tu∣nings, but themselves also, and by their active Hands and airy Fancies, oblig'd the Musick-lovers of our Nation with transcen∣dant Harmony, <HI>viz. Goutier, Penel, Merceur, Mesanges, Du Faulx,</HI> &amp;c. after whom of
<PB N="89" REF="50"/>
our own Nation came Mr. <HI>John Rogers, Gou∣tier</HI>'s Scholar, Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> Dr. <HI>No,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Hubbard,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Wootton</HI> now living. And no less famous in their kind, that is, for Workmanship, were old <HI>Alla∣by,</HI> and <HI>Walter Johnson.</HI> But the fine easie Ghittar, whose performance is soon gain'd, at least after the brushing way, hath at this present over-topt the nobler Lute. Nor is it to be denied, but that after the pinching way, some good Work may be made of the Ghittar by such as Sir <HI>Francesco Corbetto,</HI> Mr. <HI>Janvier, Signor Pedro,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wootton</HI> afore∣mention'd, and the like. Nevertheless the Theorbo, which is no other than an Arch-Lute, keeping to the old Tuning, is still generally made use of in Consorts. And there are yet among the judicious, who think it the most agreeable and becoming Associate to vocal Musick, remembring how nobly it sounded in the Hands of Dr. <HI>Wilson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Henry Ferabosco,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Coleman,</HI> Mr. <HI>Alphonso Marsh</HI> lately decea∣sed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Play'd on alone, never did it speak such harmonious things in our <HI>English</HI> Climate, as when touch'd by the famous Dr. <HI>Walgrave,</HI> Physician at present to his Royal Highness, to whom Mr. <HI>Shadwell</HI> comes nearest for an excellent Hand. For Consort, our chief Theorbo-men at this
<PB N="90" REF="51"/>
day are Mr. <HI>Brockwell,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Flower.</HI> The Organ cannot well be laid aside, as being an Instrument of highest perfection, and the most proper of all others for Ca∣thedral Service. What Antiquity it chal∣lenges in our Nation is uncertain; but as no Nation can boast of greater Masters than old <HI>Bull, Tomkins, Jeffreys,</HI> Dr. <HI>Gibbons,</HI> Dr. <HI>Child,</HI> Mr. <HI>Matthew Lock,</HI> and at present Dr. <HI>Bleau,</HI> Organist to his Majesty, Mr. <HI>Henry, Pursel,</HI> Organist to the Abbey, Mr. <HI>Michael Wise,</HI> Mr. <HI>Francis Forcer,</HI> &amp;c. so it hath been wonderfully advanc'd of late years, by the addition of several melodious Stops, the greatest Artist at present, not to mention <HI>Pease, Burral,</HI> and others of late years, being Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> living in the <HI>So-ho.</HI> The Harpsicon is of late wonderfully im∣prov'd by the Invention of the Pedal, which brings it so much nearer to the Organ, that it only seems to come short of it in Lungs. The greatest Master on it now living in our Region, especially since the decease of Mr. <HI>Thatcher,</HI> is Mr. <HI>Disnier,</HI> and the greatest Fabricator Mr. <HI>Howard.</HI> And here also may not unfitly be mention'd, that pretty Fancy of a Musical Automaton, being a kind of Harpsicon, which by a Clock-work-motion discharcheth a certain set number of Tunes, according as it is wound up to this or that
<PB N="91" REF="51"/>
Tune. Of this sort of Automata, there is to be seen a very neat piece of Art of Reed∣work, at a House at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Mary-overs</HI>-Dock; the Artificer thereof, Mr. <HI>Thomas Hill</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> being a Person of remarkable Ingenuity, as well Musical in respect of his performance, as Mechanical for making of several other Instruments. His Pitch-Pipe, for the tuning of Musical Instruments to consort; Pitch is particularly worthy note for exactness, variety and curious Work, above any thing that is to be seen elsewhere of this nature. The Harp is rather increas'd than diminish'd in repute; and though the <HI>Welsh</HI> Gut-string formerly gave place to the <HI>Irish,</HI> Wire-string, by reason of the masterly Hands of Mr. <HI>John Cob,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lewis Williams,</HI> now the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gut-string comes up with it, through the excellent Mastery of Mr. <HI>Maurice,</HI> Mr. <HI>Evans,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bedhurst,</HI> Mr. <HI>Webster,</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert Grant,</HI> living with my Lord <HI>Mountague,</HI> and for the Outlandish way of Playing, Mr. <HI>Arn.</HI> The Violin is now of all others generally of highest esteem, and is indeed a very use∣ful Instrument in Consort, and now arriv'd to that perfection of performance, that it were endless to enumerate all that have been of late accounted great Violin-Ma∣sters. Wherefore let the mention of <HI>Far∣mer,
<PB N="92" REF="52"/>
Twiss, Ailworth, Ayrs, Claiton, Tomlins,</HI> serve for all. The best Workmen for the making of this Instrument have been ac∣counted <HI>Comer, Raimund, Florence Barnet.</HI> Of Wind-Instruments, the Flageolet with∣in this 20 years, and since that the Flute, have been highest in vogue and frequentest in use: The chiefest Performers on it being Mr. <HI>Banister,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sutton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Young,</HI> Mr. <HI>Car,</HI> the chiefest Artisans, Mr. <HI>Scottny</HI> in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-fields.</HI> But for all sorts of Musical Instruments in general, the Violin, the Base and Lyra Viol, the Harp, the Ghit∣tar, the Lute, (even the Flageolet and Flute not altogether excepted) Mr. <HI>John Shaw,</HI> living near the <HI>May-pole</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> is acknowledg'd by the most skilful in Mu∣sick of all sorts, to be a Workman in a great measure superiour to any that have been in this Nation. Nor have the Cre∣mona Violins or Loxmollar Lutes been late∣ly of such excessive prices as formerly. For Pegs for Lutes, Viols, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mr. <HI>Bland</HI> is re∣ported the only Man at present that serves all the Instrument-makers in Town.</P>
<P>It is not very many years since the seve∣ral sorts of fine Varnish have come into knowledge and use among us, which give so beautiful a gloss to Musical Instruments, Cabinets, Tables, Picture-frames, and the
<PB N="93" REF="52"/>
like; so that many of our varnish'd Cabi∣nets may vye even with those of <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>China</HI> themselves, their ways of Varnish being now not altogether unknown unto us, whereof the rarest of all is accounted that of <HI>Ceo.</HI> The first Persons eminent for Varnishing were Mr. <HI>Lilly,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Racket,</HI> since whom it is grown very common. But that noble Lacka-varnish which imitates the Gold-colour, and hath sav'd much cost that was formerly bestow'd in the guilding of Coaches, was brought into <HI>England</HI> a∣bout 30 years since, by the learned Advan∣cer of Learning and all Noble Arts, and my best of Friends, Mr. <HI>Evelin,</HI> of <HI>Says</HI>-Court by <HI>Deptford.</HI></P>
<P>The Bow-dy about 40 years since was brought into <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Kephler.</HI></P>
<P>Our Tapistry-work, now equal to what∣ever the <HI>Attalick</HI>-Court could anciently boast, was brought in hither by Sir <HI>Francis Crane,</HI> towards the latter end of K. <HI>James</HI> his Reign, by the Encouragement of that learned Prince, who gave 2000 <HI>l.</HI> toward the building of a House at <HI>Moreclack,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Francis Clein</HI> was the first Designer.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Vasa Fictilia,</HI> or Potters-Ware, by the Art and Industry of Mr. <HI>Doight</HI> at <HI>Ful∣lam,</HI> are brought to that height of Curiosi∣ty, that our common Vessels may easily out∣vye

<P>The making of Glasses is said to have been begun in <HI>England, anno</HI> 1557. about which time there liv'd at <HI>Chiddingsfold,</HI> a Person very famous for this Art, which as it grew improv'd, the finer sort were first made at <HI>Crotchet-friers</HI>; but the ma∣king of the Flint-Glass, which is the finest and clearest ever made here, and very near, if not altogether equal to those of <HI>Venice,</HI> was first begun by Mr. <HI>Bishop,</HI> and since car∣ried on with good success by Mr. <HI>Ravens∣croft.</HI> There is now a Company of 12 Men of the Potters Trade, who are Dire∣ctors of this sort of Workmanship, chiefly exercis'd at present at the <HI>Savoy</HI>-House in the <HI>Strand.</HI> But the first Glass-plates for Looking-glasses, Coach-windows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> were made at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> now a∣bout 10 years since, by the Encouragement of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the Direction of Mr. <HI>Reeves</HI> afore-men∣tion'd.</P>
<P>The first in <HI>England</HI> who cast brass Guns, <HI>viz.</HI> Cannons, Culverines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is said to have been one <HI>John Oaven</HI>; after him <HI>Peter Band</HI> a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> in the first year of the Reign of K. <HI>Edw.</HI> the VI. cast iron Falcons, Falconets, Minions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
<PB N="95" REF="53"/>
was exceeded by his Servant <HI>Thomas John∣son,</HI> who liv'd till the year 1600.</P>
<P>In Gunsmiths-work there hath been of late years discover'd a very large increase of Art and Ingenuity, as to the Locks and Barrels of Muskets, Carbines, Pistols, and the like. In which sort of Artifice there have been many excellent Workmen; whereof at this day, Mr. <HI>Shaw,</HI> and <HI>Gif∣fard,</HI> Gunsmiths to his Majesty, and Mr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> living in <HI>Exeter-street,</HI> are esteem'd the chiefest Artists of <HI>London,</HI> and by conse∣quence, in all probability, of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Another principal branch of Smiths-work, is the making of Locks and Keys, in which nothing, was ever seen so curious and inge∣nuous, as what is done at this day by Mr. <HI>Wilkins.</HI></P>
<P>Mathematical Instruments, as Compas∣ses, Quadrants, Rulers, are most certainly now more exquisitely made than ever. Herein Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> in <HI>Hosier-lane,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hays</HI> in <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> were lately the most celebrated Workmen; now Mr. <HI>Markham</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Winne</HI> in <HI>Chancery∣lane.</HI></P>
<P>The Projection of Globes, Spheres and Maps, is without controversie now more exactly understood than formerly, through the Ingenuity first of Mr. <HI>Moxon,</HI> now of
<PB N="96" REF="54"/>
Mr. <HI>Berry</HI> near <HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mor∣dant</HI> in <HI>Cornhil.</HI> Nor is there without all doubt in all things of this nature, a better Graver than Mr. <HI>Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>And here may not unfitly be mention'd the new Invention of an Iron Pen, which besides its lastingness, is equally fit for use with the best Goose-Quill whatsoever: By Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> Writing-Master to <HI>Christ-Church</HI>-Hospital.</P>
<P>Having spoken of Printing, it will not be unseasonable to intimate how much Let∣ter-founding hath been advanc'd of late. S. <HI>Henry Savil</HI>'s silver Character for the prin∣ting of his <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> was much admir'd at that time; but of late we have had many Books printed in very delicate Characters, both small and great, especially the fine small Greek Character, in which several Greek Poets have been printed at the <HI>Thea∣tre</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> is so curious, that nothing can be more, not excepting the fine small Prints of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> or <HI>Leyden.</HI></P>
<P>It would be endless to reckon up all the new Allamodes of Cloths, Stuffs, Silks, Ribbands, and the like.</P>
<P>But of the many curious Pieces in Wax-work, Straw-work, Acupiction in Silks and Sattins, cutting of Paper, Cloth, or fine Leather, into exquisite Figures, folding
<PB N="97" REF="54"/>
of Napkins into the shapes of Birds, Beasts, or Fishes, tho Ingenuity of former Ages (as to most of these Artifices) hath per∣haps not receiv'd much addition. Though in Wax there are to be seen very curious things of late Workmanship, which possibly have arriv'd to utmost Improvement: For Imbossment in Wax, Mr. <HI>Houseman</HI> was certainly the best Artist that hath been known in these Parts.</P>
<P>The rich Embroidery of former Times, as will appear to those, who visiting the Houses of the old Nobility and Gentry, be∣hold the pompous Furniture left by the An∣cestry of those Families, is, as I conjecture, not easily out-done, if equall'd, by any thing this Age can produce.</P>
<P>The Art of making fine white Thread, is said to have been brought into <HI>England</HI> about the year 1670. by Mr. <HI>Joseph Allen,</HI> Citizen and Merchant-Taylor of <HI>London,</HI> keeping a Thread-shop in <HI>Bishopgate-street,</HI> at the <HI>Golden Anchor</HI> near <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> even to the value of 3 <HI>l.</HI> the pound, and vying with the Nuns Thread of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>The Glassen Bee-hive is mention'd by my Ingenious Friend Mr. <HI>John Worlidge</HI> of <HI>Pe∣tersfield,</HI> to have been the Contrivance of Mr. <HI>William Mew,</HI> Minister of <HI>Easlington</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI> He also mentions a wooden
<PB N="98" REF="55"/>
Hive of an Octangle form, with a glass Window in one of the sides. This glassen Bee-hive, I remember, about 30 years ago, was much talk'd of as a great Rarity, when the late Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> Dr. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> had of them in his Garden at <HI>Wadham</HI>-Colledg, whereof he was then Warden; both sorts are now sufficiently common, but they are no where to be seen better order'd and more curious than at Mr. <HI>Evelin</HI>'s Paradice of a Garden by <HI>Deptford.</HI></P>
<P>The Plow, though as ancient as Tillage it self; the Improvements are but of late years: The chief whereof mention'd by Mr. <HI>Blith</HI> and Mr. <HI>Worlidge,</HI> are the single wheel'd Plow and the double wheel'd Plow, and the double Plow, which is in the nature of two Plows joyn'd together. Mr. <HI>John Houghton</HI> also (worthily for his great In∣genuity and Industry) a Fellow of the <HI>Roy∣al Society,</HI> in that most useful Design of his, call'd, <HI>A Collection of Letters for the Improve∣ment of Husbandry,</HI> inserts an Invention of <HI>Thomas Llewellin,</HI> at the <HI>George</HI> in <HI>Cateaten-street,</HI> for plowing with one Man and two Horses or Oxen, a greater quantity of Land than can be perform'd at the same time with double the number of Men and Cattel. He also in the same Sheet gives a large de∣scription of a Malt-kill at <HI>Nottingham.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="55"/>Engines of grand bulk, force and per∣formance, are doubtless near as ancient as whatever Art or Invention have produc'd, being of too great necessity to be unthought of by any thinking or inventing People.</P>
<P>Cranes and Engines for the drawing up of Goods of great bulk and weight, such as we have at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> and such like Places, are mention'd in ancient Authors.</P>
<P>Also in War, the <HI>Arcubalistae,</HI> and the <HI>Arietes</HI> or Battering-Rams, which against the Walls of besieged Towns did more than multitudes of Men.</P>
<P>What the Antiquity is of Corn Wind-mills, is hard to determine whether in this or any other Nation.</P>
<P>The Paper-Mill is certainly of no mo∣dern Invention, and it may be wonder'd that in all this time Paper-making hath not been brought to a greater height in this Na∣tion, it being judg'd very possible, that as good Paper might be made in <HI>England,</HI> as any is brought over from <HI>France, Holland,</HI> or any other foreign Part.</P>
<P>The Powder-Mill cannot be of very long standing, since it is scarce 200 years that Gunpowder it self hath bounc'd and made a smoak in the World.</P>
<P>Moreover, of these grand performing Engines, there is a very great number even
<PB N="100" REF="56"/>
of late Invention, of which I shall endea∣vour to call to mind at least the most no∣ted.</P>
<P>For the grubbing up of Stumps of Oak, there is an Engine call'd the <HI>German Devil,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Evelin</HI> in his incomparable Trea∣tise of Forest-trees, affirms to have been made use of by a Noble Person of this Na∣tion with that success, that by the help thereof one Man was able to do more than could otherwise have been done by 12 Ox∣en. He also in the same Treatise, <HI>p.</HI> 22. gives a description of another Engine for the transplanting of Trees.</P>
<P>The silk-Stocking Frame is surely one of the most curious Contrivances of this Age. It is said to have been first us'd at <HI>Notting∣ham,</HI> and was, as I have been told, the sea∣sonable Fancy of a poor <HI>Oxford</HI> Scholar, who to inch out the slender pittance of a small Living he had thereabouts, was glad to make use of his Wives manual Assistance; but that not sufficing neither to satisfie the importunate Stomachs of an increasing Fa∣mily, he prompted by Necessity, which is the Mother of Art, as ancient Authors af∣firm, joyn'd his Head to her Hands, his In∣genuity to her Industry, and thence brought forth this rare Device, to shorten the la∣bour, and increase the profit of her Work.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="56"/>The Saw-Mill or Engine for sawing of Timber is of <HI>Dutch</HI> Original, and about 25 or 30 years ago first brought in use among us, for so long it is since that on the <HI>Thames</HI> over against <HI>Durham</HI>-yard was first erected. The Wire-Mill of Mr. <HI>Mumma,</HI> a <HI>Dutch∣man,</HI> was first set up at <HI>Sheen</HI> within these 20 years.</P>
<P>All the Money coin'd in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> almost ever since his Majesty's Re∣storation, hath been by an Engine or Coin∣ing-Mill, brought in by the <HI>Rotiers,</HI> who thereupon became and so continue to this present, his Majesty's chief Moneyers.</P>
<P>The Weavers Loom-Engine hath not been in use many years in <HI>England,</HI> especi∣ally the highest Improvement thereof call'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Loom, brought in about 5 or 6 years since by Mr. <HI>Crouch,</HI> a Weaver in <HI>Bi∣shopsgate-street.</HI></P>
<P>A very useful Invention was that Engine call'd the <HI>Persian</HI> Wheel, for the watring of Meadows, which lye uncapably of being overflow'd. The first of these Engines brought to any considerable perfection, was erected at the end of <HI>Wilton</HI>-Garden, by the Direction of the above-mention'd Mr. <HI>Worlidge,</HI> Wood-Steward to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> in the year 1665. who in his <HI>Sy∣stema Agriculturae,</HI> takes notice of another
<PB N="102" REF="57"/>
Engine to the same purpose, call'd the Ho∣rizontal Windmil. And in his Treatise of Sider, he describes the <HI>Ingenio</HI> or rare Si∣der-Engine, a Contrivance doubtless very profitable for those that drive a Trade in the making of this Liquor.</P>
<P>There is also very lately found out the admirable Water-Engine, for raising of Ballas and towing of Ships. Yet as excel∣lent as these Inventions are, and as useful to the Publick, by dispatching at one in∣stant the tedious drudgery of many Hands, yet there are not wanting high Clamours against them, as robbing poor men of their Imployments, and consequently of their Livelihoods; so hard it is to find any Con∣venience totally exempted from Cavil and Exception. Even the Quench-fire Engine, that most excellent and salutiferous Inven∣tion of Sir <HI>Samuel Moreland,</HI> 'tis possible may be an Eye-sore to such <HI>Neronian</HI> Tem∣pers, as love to see Towns and Cities on fire. However the World is oblig'd to this learned Mechanick, as well for this as se∣veral other useful and ingenuous Contri∣vances, particularly his Arithmetical Instru∣ment, and his Stenterophonick or Speaking Trumpet, the chief use whereof is to treat or parly with an Enemy at a distance.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="57"/>There is to be seen by all Lovers of Art, a rare Invention of Mr. <HI>Edgebury,</HI> call'd the Horizontal Corn-mill, upon a piece of Land at <HI>Deptford,</HI> belonging to my most Honour'd Friend Mr. <HI>Evelin</HI> junior.</P>
<P>It is now about 7 or 8 years, since a Print∣ing-Press for the printing of Callcoes, was set on foot by Mr. <HI>Mellish</HI>; but he soon de∣sisting, the Design was taken up by Mr. <HI>William Sherwin,</HI> living in <HI>Little-Britain,</HI> and ever since carried on with great vigour and success.</P>
<P>To conclude: There remains yet to be spoken of one rare Engine, and in some sence above all that have been yet menti∣on'd, since it brings back Old Age to Youth, and makes threescore and ten ap∣pear as fine and gay as five and twenty. I do not mean simply the Perruke, or Frame of Artificial formerly worn, for that may possibly be as ancient as the Emperour <HI>Ca∣rolus Calvus</HI> his Time, who wanting Hair of his own, is reported to have call'd a Councel of <HI>French</HI> Barbers, to contrive an artificial Supplement of Natures Defect: But I mean, that lofty towring Structure or Machine of Hair, so heighten'd and or∣namented, as it hath been by Tonsorian Art and Industry, within these last 20 years, so frounc'd, so curl'd in a 1000
<PB N="104" REF="58"/>
amorous Annulets, so plump'd up, so streaming in the Air like a Ships Top-gal∣lant, that certainly never any <HI>Cincinnatus</HI> or <HI>Capillatus</HI> whatsoever, could boast a na∣tural Head of Hair comparable to this arti∣ficial; much more may it be judg'd easily to outvye the ancient <HI>Median Cidaris,</HI> the <HI>Persian Tiara,</HI> or the now <HI>Ottoman</HI> Turbant; and doubtless had it been devis'd in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Time, it would quickly have put out of countenance the best of his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>

It hath large Streets, and divers fair Buildings both publick and pri∣vate; besides its Churches, a strong Ca∣stle, the Bishop's Palace, the Tolbooth for Merchants, a fair large Key, affording a most pleasant Prospect of Ships, coming up to the very Town, and the Goutes or Sinks that carry the Water under ground, render the Streets exceeding neat and clean.</P>

<P><HI>Rochester</HI> is not only preferrable as a Ci∣ty, to all the Places in <HI>Kent</HI> next to <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> for its fair Building and pleasant Situation upon the River <HI>Medway.</HI> But the chief Grandure of this City consists in its Cathedral and stately Bridge: Of which more in its due place.</P>

this City and other Parts of the Nation. The most eminent of its Structures, are the Wall giving entrance by six Gates, and adorn'd with divers Watch-Towers, a strong and stately Castle, and a vary noble and sumptuous Cathedral.</P>
<P><HI>Salisbury</HI> Cathedral is accounted in some respects the noblest in <HI>England,</HI> at least there are very few equal to it. The City is pleasantly water'd with clear Rivulets, running through the length of each Street, and the Market-place very large and hand∣som.</P>
<P><HI>Glocester</HI> is pleasantly situated upon the River <HI>Severn.</HI> It hath been anciently much celebrated for its Monastery of Nuns, built by <HI>Keneburgh, Eadburgh</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and is at present for its stately Minster.</P>
<P><HI>Worcester</HI> hath a Wall about it, one thou∣sand six hundred and fifty paces in circuit, with a seven-fold entrance of Gates, and five Watch-Towers, for ornament and se∣curity: Nor is its Minster the least conside∣rable among the Cathedrals of <HI>England</HI> for Structure, besides the Monuments of Anti∣quity therein, elsewhere mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="62"/><HI>Bath,</HI> besides the Magnificence of its publick <HI>Bagno</HI>'s, is sufficiently recommenda∣ble for its private Buildings; the Streets thereof, when the season of the year ren∣ders them least frequented, seem to repre∣sent a kind of solemn and majestick Soli∣tude, as may be fancy'd in several of those Towns and Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> which consist of splendid Buildings, but thinly inhabi∣ted.</P>
<P><HI>Durham</HI> consists of good handsom old fashion'd Buildings; but for publick Stru∣ctures besides its Church, it chiefly boasts the Castle, built there by K. <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, which advanceth its Head lof∣tily upon a high Hill.</P>
<P><HI>Lincoln</HI> is also one of the noblest Cities of <HI>England.</HI> It hath at this day 15 Parish-Churches besides the Great Church, yet seems it but the Epitome of what it was anciently; for it is deliver'd to have had no less than 50 Parish-Churches, was won∣derful populous and well traded, and hath been adorn'd with many fair and ample Buildings, as well Monasteries as others, as appears by the Ruines, in which something of Magnificence is to be observ'd.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="63"/><HI>Winchester</HI> is a City pleasantly situated in a Valley, and walled about with a strong Wall, one thousand eight hundred and eighty paces in circuit, and entred by six Gates; on the East-side runs the River, and on the West-side stands a strong Castle. It hath seven Parish-Churches, and a good old large Minster, besides the Ruines of certain Monasteries and other publick Buildings; moreover the Colledge and School may be reckon'd among the Orna∣ments of this Place, though not standing in the City, but about half a mile out of the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Coventry</HI> is a City particularly noted by <HI>Speed</HI> for statelyness of Building, and was encompass'd with a strong and stately Wall, which with the Walls of several other Towns was pull'd down, since his Maje∣sty's Restoration. The Walls had 13 Gates for Entrance, and 18 Towers for Orna∣ment; but that which was heretofore the greatest Ornament of this City, was that stately Structure of a Cross, which was among the number of those erected to the memory of Queen <HI>Elianor,</HI> and the most magnificent of all next to that of <HI>Cheapfide</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> with which it underwent the same Fate, that is, to be demolish'd by
<PB N="115" REF="63"/>
the zealous multitude, the most lewd re∣formers of Lewdness, and the most super∣stitious haters of Superstition.</P>
<P><HI>Ipswich,</HI> besides that it is the Shire-Town of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> is also generally accounted the principal Town of <HI>England,</HI> and were it dignified with the title of City, would be equal to many, inferior to few of the Cities of this Nation. It hath 12 Parish-Chur∣ches yet standing, besides 6 fall'n to decay, and several fair Streets full of goodly and substantial Buildings, and a very commodi∣ous Haven.</P>
<P>S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Edmondsbury</HI> in the same County, ex∣cepting what it wants in ampleness of Cir∣cuit, comes very near in other respects, es∣pecially if we reckon the Grandeur of its once famous Monastery, of which there yet remains something of it very great and stately. But to sum up the Glory of this Place, it will be sufficient to repeat what <HI>Speed</HI> quotes from <HI>Leyland,</HI> viz. <HI>The Sun hath not seen a City</HI> (so he calls it) <HI>more fine∣ly and delicately seated upon an ascent of a Hill, having a River running on the East-side, nor was there ever a more noble Abbey, either for Revenues or incomparable Magnificence,</HI> in whose Circuit appeareth rather a City

than a Monastery; so many Gates for En∣trance, and some of Brass; so many Tow∣ers, and a most glorious Church, upon which attend three others, standing all in the same Church-yard, all of them passing fine, and of a curious Workmanship.</P>
<P><HI>Maidston</HI> is pleasantly seated upon the River <HI>Medway,</HI> and for a meer Town, is reputed the handsomest and most flourishing of all <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Feversham</HI> is also to be noted, not only for its Antiquities, but likewise for its plea∣sant and commodious Situation.</P>
<P><HI>Kingston upon Thames,</HI> so call'd, to di∣stinguish it from the other <HI>Kingston upon Hull,</HI> stands very pleasantly, and makes a fine Prospect upon the River <HI>Thames.</HI> It hath a very fair and spacious Market-place, and hath been in former Ages a Place of no mean Repute, (at least springs from such a one) as will appear by what we shall have occasion to speak of it elsewhere.</P>
<P><HI>Guilford</HI> comes here to be mention'd, only as a pleasant and well built Town; to which may be added, that for the big∣ness, there is scarce any other Place to com∣pare
<PB N="117" REF="64"/>
with it for number of fair and large Inns; so that this Town and <HI>Kingston, (Southwark</HI> being annext to <HI>London</HI>) may pass for the two chief Towns of <HI>Surry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> is esteemed worthily to stand in competition with the City <HI>Chichester</HI> it self, for largeness, populousness and fair Build∣ing, at least it is far surpassing all the other Towns of <HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Colchester,</HI> which <HI>Speed</HI> honours with the title of City, is pleasantly situated upon the River <HI>Coln,</HI> hath a Wall of 1980 paces in compass, raised upon a high Trench, and enter'd by 6 Gates and 3 Posterns Westward, and being also adorn'd with 9 Watch-Towers, within the circuit of which Walls there are 8 Parish-Churches, besides 2 without▪ Eastward, an old strong Ca∣stle stands upon a strong Trench, and upon another Trench hard by are to be discern'd the Ruines of an ancienter Castle; and though there are some other noted Towns in this Shire, as <HI>Maldon, Chelmsford,</HI> &amp;c. yet this <HI>Colchester,</HI> however no City, may well enough be allow'd to merit the Character it hath, <HI>viz.</HI> of Shire-Town of <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="65"/><HI>Buckingham</HI> is pleasantly seated upon the River <HI>Ouse,</HI> with which it is altogether surrounded, except on the North-side; 3 fair Stone-Bridges, giving entrance over the River, and though but a Town, hath the credit to be both the denominating and principal Town of the Shire.</P>
<P><HI>Ailesbury,</HI> of the same County, is a Town well enough for Building, and the handsomness of its Market-place; but that which makes it most perspicuous, is, that it stands in the midst of most delightful Meads and Pastures, and the whole Vale, which being one of the pleasantest and fer∣tilest of <HI>England,</HI> is perhaps one of the pleasantest and fertilest of <HI>Europe,</HI> is thence denominated the <HI>Vale of Ailesbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reading,</HI> a very ancient Town, and as <HI>Leland</HI> and others observe, excelling all other Towns in <HI>Barkshire,</HI> as well for fair Streets and sightly Buildings, as the Wealth of the Townsmen.</P>
<P><HI>Cambridge,</HI> a Town not despicable for its own proper Buildings, were the Situation as little liable to exception, but borrowing its chief Magnificence from the lustre of those 16 Colledges and Halls, which shine
<PB N="119" REF="65"/>
like so many Gems about it, yet far more illustrious by those bright Lamps of Learn∣ing, which from this Place have shot their Lights into the World. The most eminent Structure of all the rest in <HI>Cambridge</HI> is <HI>Kings-Colledge</HI>-Chappel; but there is now a Library building in this University, which, it is thought, will be able to compare with any of the best Buildings of this Age; but notwithstanding all, it is but the chief Town of <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> and not a City, though there be an Episcopal See in the same County.</P>
<P><HI>Southampton,</HI> a Town, saith <HI>Speed,</HI> beau∣tiful, rich and populous, and walled about with a strong Wall of square Stone, enter'd by 7 Gates, and adorn'd and fortified with 29 Towers; within the Walls there are 5 fair Parish-Churches, besides an Hospital called <HI>Gods-House</HI>; and without the Walls are to be seen the Ruines of another good∣ly Church called S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maries.</HI> On the West-end of the Town, a well built Castle of a circular form, mounted upon a high Hill so steep, as not to be ascended but by Stairs, gives a fair Prospect both by Land and Sea; and lastly, Two commodious Keys for Ships, give a great ornament to the Place. This Town, though <HI>Winchester</HI> predominates as
<PB N="120" REF="66"/>
a City, was doubtless, as by the Name ap∣pears, the ancient Metropolis of <HI>Hantshire,</HI> and is still accounted the Shire-Town.</P>
<P><HI>Marlborough,</HI> one of the most considera∣ble Towns of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> which as it is in general a good tolerable well built Town, so it hath one Street above the rest remarkable for its fairness and largeness, being also ve∣ry much graced with a large neat <HI>Forum</HI> or Market-place at the upper end thereof. About a dozen years ago there hapned a shrewd Fire, which burnt down a great part of this Street, which being rebuilt to ad∣vantage, the Street appears much more stately than before; and that which gives the greater grace to it, is the Prospect of a fine House of my Lord <HI>Seymour</HI>'s, at the Towns end, which is the more remarkable, by reason of a Mount which is ascended by a Path, which winds round about upward toward the top like a Screw.</P>
<P><HI>Warwick</HI> is most pleasantly situated upon the ascent of a Hill, taking its rise from the side of a River, whose stream runs point∣ing toward a stately Castle, the Seat of the famous <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Warwick,</HI> which having run much to ruine, was repair'd with sumptu∣ous Buildings by Sir <HI>Fulk Grevil.</HI> There
<PB N="121" REF="66"/>
have been 6 fair Churches in this Town, <HI>viz.</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Lawrence,</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Michaels, John Baptist,</HI> and <HI>John of Jerusalem,</HI> St. <HI>Maries</HI> and St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> all gone to ruine but the two last. This City, yet as the denominating and principal Town of <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> seems of equal repute with <HI>Coventry</HI> it self.</P>
<P><HI>Shirburn,</HI> a Town pleasantly seated on the side of a Hill, and very well adorn'd with Structures, especially publick, as Church, Castle, and School-house.</P>
<P><HI>Northampton</HI> must needs be at this day a very stately Place, for having had the com∣mendation, from the chief of our <HI>English</HI> Geographers, of being worthy to be <HI>rank'd, for Circuit, Beauty and Building, with the most of the Cities of our Land.</HI> It was by some unfortunate Accident burnt almost totally down to the ground, and Phaenix-like is risen out of its ashes, much more glorious than before; and notwith∣standing the City of of <HI>Peterborough</HI> stands within the County, claims to be the County Town of <HI>Northamptonshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nottingham,</HI> saith our most diligent and industrious <HI>Speed,</HI> is a Town seated most pleasant and delicate upon a high Hill; for
<PB N="122" REF="67"/>
Building stately, and for number of fair Streets surpassing many other Cities, and for a spacious and sumptuous Market-place, and 3 fair Churches, comparing with the best. Many of the Buildings of this Town are hewed out of the Rocks, besides many strange Vaults and Caves; among which those under the Castle are of especial Note: One for the Story of Christ's Passion, en∣graven in the Walls, by the Hand of <HI>David,</HI> the 2<SUP>d</SUP> of that Name, King of <HI>Scots,</HI> whilst he was there kept Prisoner: Another wherein <HI>Mortimer</HI> was apprehended, in the minority of K. <HI>Edw.</HI> the 3<SUP>d</SUP>, whence it hath ever since born the Name of <HI>Mortimer</HI>'s <HI>Hole.</HI> These have their several winding Stairs, Windows, Chimnies, and Room above Room, wrought all out of the solid Rock, as other Houses of the Town also have. This Town being the Principal of <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI> hath no City to stand in competition with it.</P>
<P><HI>Newark,</HI> the next Town of <HI>Nottingham∣shire,</HI> both for Reputation and Neatness. It is indeed a Town of a very pleasant Si∣tuation upon the River <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="67"/><HI>Manchester,</HI> the fairest and pleasantest, though not the principal Town of <HI>Lanca∣shire,</HI> and above all things else peculiarly remark'd for its grand Church, the Col∣ledge and Market-place.</P>
<P><HI>Wakefield,</HI> one of the chief Towns of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> as well for its pleasantness and goodly Buildings, as its great Market and Cloathing-Trade, and other Remarks: Of which elsewhere.</P>
<P><HI>Stamford,</HI> the pleasantest Place of <HI>Lin∣colnshire,</HI> next to the City of <HI>Lincoln</HI> it self, being adorn'd with 7 Churches, and an old Hospital.</P>
<P><HI>Boston,</HI> the best Town of <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> next to <HI>Stamford:</HI> Which is all need be said of it at present, in regard there will be occasion to speak more of it in the next Chapter of Towns and Places eminent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Barstable</HI> and <HI>Tavestoke</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> are commended above most in the West of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> for neatness, well compactedness, and elegance of Structure. <HI>Tavestoke</HI> is proba∣bly enough so call'd, from the River <HI>Taw,</HI> upon which it stands, and which at <HI>Barsta∣ble</HI> is said to be Navigable for great Vessels,
<PB N="124" REF="68"/>
both Places being well inhabited with Mer∣chants, and rich trading People.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> of all the Places of <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> not dignified with the title of City, <HI>Taunton</HI> is accounted of principal Note, and for pleasantness superior, accor∣ding to the Testimony of a learned Writer in these words: <HI>Taunton qu. Thonton, from the River Thone, is a very fine and proper Town, one of the Eyes of the Shire; the Country here most delectable on every side with green Mea∣dows, flourishing with pleasant Gardens and Orchards, and replenisht with fair Mannor-Houses, wonderfully contenteth the Eyes of the Beholders.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> as it is the principal Town of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> there being neither City nor any other Town of Note in that Shire that can stand in competition with it, so it may be reckon'd among the pleasantest of all <HI>England,</HI> being almost surrounded with the <HI>Severn,</HI> between which and a stately Wall are most delightful Meadows; the chief Streets graceful of themselves are set out with several graceful Buildings besides the publick, among which the most remarkable are the two Gate-houses on the Bridges, the Market-place of Free-stone, a strong
<PB N="125" REF="68"/>
Castle mounted on a Hill, a neat School∣house with a Library, 4 Parish-Churches, and 3 of them very large and goodly, be∣sides the Abbey forehead, without which bears the semblance of an old Cathedral.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> there are many other pleasant Towns in <HI>Shropshire,</HI> among which, the chiefest in repute are <HI>Ludlow</HI> and <HI>Bridg∣north. Ludlow</HI>'s chief State consists in its strong Castle, and its lofty situation upon a high Hill; and proper enough is the En∣comium it hath gain'd of <HI>Cambden,</HI> that it is <HI>a Town more fair than ancient. Bridgnorth</HI> also is proudly advanc'd a great part of it upon a Rock, out of which the chief Ave∣nues to that upper part are cut; moreover, the Castle, the Wall, and the <HI>Severn</HI>'s In∣closure, give addition of State as well as Strength.</P>
<P><HI>Tewksbury</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> is a Town that might well enough be insisted on for its elegancy of Building and pleasant Situa∣tion, but that other special Remarks re∣quire the mention of it elsewhere.</P>
<P>The like may be said of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> which hath yet some Ruines left of that Beauty and Magnificence which it receiv'd from the
<PB N="126" REF="69"/>
<HI>Romans,</HI> of whom it was anciently one of the principal Residences.</P>
<P>The Palaces Royal of <HI>England</HI> are in the first place <HI>Whitehal,</HI> built by Cardinal <HI>Woolfie,</HI> and from K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 8<SUP>th</SUP> to his present Majesty, the principal and Imperial Residence of all our Kings. This Palace is in general rather to be commended for its large Capacity and Convenience, than for State and outward Shew; yet that part which is call'd the <HI>Banquetting-house,</HI> for its sumptuous Appearance and Regularity of Architecture, is judg'd by most of the Cu∣rious, fit to stand in competition with the chief Structures of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Next, S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s, a House somewhat more sightly to view, and delicately situated in the most pleasant of Parks; it hath been usually the Residence of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> but is now of his Royal Highness, the same in Effect, though not in Title.</P>
<P><HI>Somerset-house</HI> is the usual Residence of the Queens of <HI>England,</HI> as it is now of her present Majesty.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="69"/><HI>Hampton-Court</HI> in <HI>Middlesex,</HI> hath been of late the Principal of our King's Residen∣ces out of <HI>London,</HI> a brave, large, Noble House, in the midst of a most stately Park.</P>
<P>But at present <HI>Windsor</HI>-Castle in <HI>Bark∣shire,</HI> is his Majesty's chosen Place of Plea∣sure and Retirement, being besides its most delightful Situation, as being advanc'd up∣on a high Hill, rising with a gradual as∣cent, which affords the sweetest Prospect imaginable, a Place of great Magnificence, and now improv'd to a wonderful heighth of State and Beauty.</P>
<P>Other Places of Note for Royal Seats are <HI>Richmond</HI> or <HI>Sheen, Nonsuch</HI> in <HI>Surry, Green∣wich</HI> and <HI>Eltham</HI> in <HI>Kent, Enfield</HI> and <HI>Han∣worth</HI> in <HI>Middlesex, Holdenby</HI> in <HI>Northamp∣tenshire.</HI></P>
<P>The Noblemens Palaces we shall have oc∣casion to give a full account of, in the Ca∣talogue of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility.</P>
<P>The Cathedrals of <HI>England</HI> are perhaps, take them one with another, as remarkable as those of any Country whatsoever; but the most eminent (besides S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Pauls</HI>) are those of <HI>Westminster, Salisbury, Canterbury,
<PB N="128" REF="70"/>
York, Worcester, Glocester, Chichester, Norwich, Winchester, Exeter, Wells,</HI> and <HI>Peterborough.</HI> Most of which have been already touch'd upon, in the several Places to which they belong; however it will not be improper to speak a little more particularly of them in this Place.</P>
<P>S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Pauls,</HI> before its last fatal destruction by Fire, had nothing to stand in competiti∣on but S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Peters</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI>; what it will be when rebuilt, may be in some measure con∣jectur'd, by the Grandure which already appears.</P>
<P><HI>Westminster-Abbey</HI> is a Noble Piece of Work, and is said to have been 50 years in building, and it receives a great addition of lustre, by the addition of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 7<SUP>th</SUP>'s Chappel, the Workmanship whereof for curiosity of Carving is hardly to be pa∣rallel'd.</P>
<P><HI>Salisbury-Minster</HI> is fam'd in general for one of the stateliest of <HI>English</HI> Structures, and particularly noted for its high spired Steeple, its double cross Isles, its Windows answering to the Days, its Pillars to the Hours, and its Gates to the Months of the Year, besides a Cloister belonging to it, fa∣mous
<PB N="129" REF="70"/>
for Largeness and fine Workman∣ship.</P>
<P><HI>Canterbury-Cathedral</HI> hath been famous for its rich Window, and the Tomb of <HI>Tho∣mas a Becket.</HI></P>
<P>That of <HI>York</HI> seems next of Note and Esteem, for an ample and stately Fabrick.</P>
<P><HI>Worcester-Cathedral</HI> is by a learned Writer deservedly entitled, a <HI>passing fair Building,</HI> adorn'd with many Princely and Noble Monuments.</P>
<P>Nor is <HI>Glocester-Cathedral</HI> accounted in∣ferior, besides the Fame of its Whispering Place.</P>
<P>Also that of <HI>Litchfield,</HI> before its demo∣lishment, is said for elegant and proportio∣nal Building to have yielded very few.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Chichester</HI> is not so large as neat, having a Spire-Steeple, which ad∣vanceth it self up to a majestick heighth▪</P>
<P>The Cloister of the Cathedral of <HI>Nor∣wich,</HI> is accounted the fairest in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="71"/><HI>Winchester-Cathedral</HI> is a brave old so∣lemn Structure; so likewise is that of <HI>Lin∣coln</HI>; which last is also famous for its great Bell call'd <HI>Tom of Lincoln,</HI> the biggest in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Exeter-Cathedral</HI> is remarkable for its brave, noble, carv'd Work, at the West∣end thereof; so likewise are those of <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, There are few or none of the Ca∣thedrals of this Nation, of whose Grandeur there is not enough to be said to make a Volume.</P>
<P>There are a number of Parish-Churches that deserve particular mention.</P>
<P>In <HI>London</HI> there are many, especially since the rebuilding of the City, remarkable for Beauty and State. But the chief are S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Se∣pulchre,</HI> and S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maries le Bow,</HI> whose Stee∣ple is such, that certainly a nobler is scarce to be seen.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> is much admir'd, for a Fabrick of such Magnitude and State, unsupported with Pillars.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="71"/>The like may be said of <HI>Lincolns-Inn</HI>-Chappel, which is also observable for the curious vaulted Walk over which it is built.</P>
<P>Likewise that round vaulted Roof of the <HI>Inner-Temple</HI>-Church, under which lye up∣on the ground several Sepulchral Statues of Knights, Templars, within a four-square Empalement of Iron-work, is a Structure of that kind not to be parallel'd by any.</P>
<P>Nor is the new built Church of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Cle∣ments</HI> to be wholly pass'd by, as exceeding much, both for the outward and inward Workmanship, and particularly the fine Fret-work on the Cieling.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Bath,</HI> though <HI>Litchfield</HI> be the Bishop's principal Seat, is by some call'd a Cathedral, and for largeness and elegance of Building may well enough be so accounted.</P>
<P>Of the 5 Churches of <HI>Derby,</HI> that nam'd <HI>All-Hallows,</HI> is of chief Reputel, for its Tower-Steeple, of a stately heighth, and excellent Structure, and whose Foundation was laid, and part of it built, by young Men and Maids, as appears by Letters gra∣ven thereon.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="72"/>The Church of <HI>Shirburn</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> is much noted for its curious Workmanship within.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Grantham</HI> chiefly emi∣nent for the excessive heighth of its Steeple, which possibly gives occasion of that vulgar Report of this Steeple's standing awry, and of that fabulous Tradition of its having been, built by Hell's great Architect, who misliking something or other, gave it such a Blow with his Ruler, that it hath stood awry ever since.</P>
<P>S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Maries</HI> of <HI>Ratcliff</HI> in <HI>Bristow,</HI> for the stately ascent to it, its largeness, curious Workmanship, embowed Arch of Stone, and its lofty Steeple, hath been accounted the noblest Parish-Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Another Church in the same City call'd the <HI>Temple,</HI> is remarkable for its Tower, which whensoever the Bell is rung, divides from the rest of the Building, with a Cleft from the bottom to the top, which gapes the breadth of three Fingers.</P>
<P>In <HI>Lancashire,</HI> the Collegiate Church of <HI>Manchester</HI> hath a Quire, which though not very large, is remarkable for its rich adorn∣ment of Wood-work.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="72"/>Among the Churches of <HI>Coventry,</HI> two standing near each other, <HI>viz. Trinity-Church</HI> and S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Michaels,</HI> are commended for their rare Workmanship and stately heighth.</P>
<P><HI>Coln,</HI> a little old Town in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> hath nothing but its fair Church to commend it.</P>
<P>Also <HI>Rippon,</HI> in the <HI>West-riding</HI> of <HI>York∣shire,</HI> whose three Steeples shew their lofty Heads at considerable distance, to Travel∣lers approaching the Place.</P>
<P>Upon the Bridge of <HI>Wakefield,</HI> in the same <HI>Riding</HI> of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> is a beautiful Chappel, erected by K. <HI>Edward</HI> the 4<SUP>th</SUP>, in memory of those of his Party who lost their Lives in the Battel there fought.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> be∣side its largeness, curious Workmanship, and its aspiring Tower-Steeple, hath this also memorable, that from the bottom to the top, the Steeple is ascended by as many Steps as there are Days in a Year.</P>
<P><HI>Yarmouth-Church</HI> (for it hath but one) gives no small addition of commendation to that Town, which is reckon'd among the most considerable of <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="73"/><HI>Oundale</HI> in <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> is render'd no less memorable for its fair Church, than for its Free-School and Alms-house.</P>
<P>At the Castle of <HI>Warkworth</HI> in <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> there is a Chappel wonderfully hewn out of a Rock, without Beams, Raf∣ters, or any thing of Timber-work.</P>
<P><HI>Wrexam</HI> in <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> hath a Church, which for neat Building, and the loftiness of its Steeple, is concluded to surpass all the Churches of <HI>North-Wales.</HI></P>
<P>But of all the Churches of this Island, (and they are among the 6 chief Remarks thereof) the Chappel of <HI>Kings-Colledge</HI> in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> already mention'd, is for rare∣ness of Architecture and Contrivance, re∣nown'd above most Structures, not only of <HI>England,</HI> but even of <HI>Europe</HI> also.</P>
<P>The Castles of <HI>England</HI> were in ancient Times the chief-Seats of our Nobility; but since the dissolution of the Abbeys, and the demolishment of very many Castles, in the several Wars of <HI>England,</HI> divers of the said Abbeys have become the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen. Yet some Noblemen at this day have ancient Castles for their chief
<PB N="135" REF="73"/>
Seats: As <HI>Barkly</HI>-Castle in <HI>Glocestershire,</HI> gives Title to the Honourable Family of the <HI>Barklys. Skelton</HI>-Castle is the Seat of the Barons <HI>Bruse.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Castles now in the several Counties, are in <HI>Cheshire, Beeston,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Chester.</HI> In <HI>Barkshire, Windsor</HI> afore-mention'd. In <HI>Cumberland,</HI> the Ca∣stle of <HI>Carlile.</HI> In <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> the Castle of the <HI>Peak.</HI> In <HI>Devonshire,</HI> the Castles of <HI>Dertmouth,</HI> and <HI>Castle-Rugemont</HI> in <HI>Exeter.</HI> In <HI>Dorcetshire, Shirburn</HI>-Castle.

In <HI>Kent,</HI> the Castles of <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Queenborough,</HI> that of <HI>Canterbury</HI> being demolisht. In <HI>Lancashire, Hornby</HI>-Castle, and that of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> which is accounted one of the three chief Magnifi∣cences of the Town, the other two being the Church and the Bridge. In <HI>Lincoln∣shire, Belvoir</HI> and <HI>Castor</HI> Castles. In <HI>Mon∣mouthshire, Chepstow</HI> and <HI>Strighal</HI> Castles. In <HI>Northamptonshire, Fotheringhay,</HI> menti∣on'd upon another account, <HI>Baibroke, Rock∣ingham</HI> and <HI>Maxey</HI> Castles. In <HI>Northumber∣land, Newcastle, Thrilwale, Tinmouth, Mor∣peth, Withrington, Warkworth</HI> and <HI>Alnwick</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="74"/>
Castles. In <HI>Richmondshire,</HI> the stately Ca∣stle of <HI>Bolton.</HI> In <HI>Shropshire, Bishops</HI>-Castle, <HI>Clun</HI>-Castle, <HI>Shrawarden</HI>-Castle, <HI>Knocking</HI>-Castle, <HI>Whittington</HI>-Castle, <HI>Routon</HI>-Castle, <HI>Tongue</HI>-Castle, whose Bell is very loud, as in noise, so in fame, in all those Parts. The Castles of <HI>Shrewsbury, Ludlow</HI> and <HI>Bridgnorth.</HI> In <HI>Somersetshire, Dunster</HI>-Ca∣stle, which was built in <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Con∣querour</HI>'s Time, by the Family of the <HI>Mo∣huns,</HI> which flourisht from that time till the Reign of K. <HI>Richard</HI> the 2<SUP>d</SUP>, in very great splendor, and ever since hath continued in considerable reputation. In <HI>Staffordshire, Stourton</HI> and <HI>Dudly</HI>-Castle, with those of <HI>Tamworth, Chartly</HI> and <HI>Tutbury</HI>; to which may be added, the memory of an old Ca∣stle at <HI>Stafford,</HI> now demolisht. In <HI>Suffolk, Framlingham</HI>-Castle, a Place of great State, Strength, Beauty and Convenience, and the Ruines of <HI>Burgh</HI>-Castle. In <HI>Surry, Holm, Beckworth</HI> and <HI>Sterborough</HI> Castles. In <HI>Sussex, Amberly</HI>-Castle, and that of <HI>Bo∣diam,</HI> belonging to the Family of the <HI>Lewk∣nors.</HI> In <HI>Warwickshire, Studly, Macstock</HI> and <HI>Ausley</HI> Castles, and the Castle of <HI>War∣wick</HI> it self. In <HI>Westmorland, Whellep</HI>-Ca∣stle and <HI>Apelby.</HI> In <HI>Wiltshire, Castlecomb, Yainsborough</HI> and <HI>Warder.</HI> In <HI>Worcestershire, Hertlebury, Holt</HI> and <HI>Elmesly</HI> Castles. In

the <HI>VVest-Riding</HI> of <HI>Yorkshire, Sheafield, Co∣nisborough, Tickil, Sandal, Harewood, Knas∣borrow</HI> and <HI>Cawood</HI> Castles. In the <HI>East-Riding,</HI> the strong Castle of <HI>VVreshil.</HI> In the <HI>North-Riding,</HI> the Castles of <HI>Scarborough, Kilton, Skelton,</HI> already mention'd, <HI>VVilton, Kildale, Gilling, Skerry-hutton</HI> and <HI>Hinder∣skell.</HI> In <HI>VVales,</HI> the most noted Castles in <HI>Caermardenshire, Carreg.</HI> In <HI>Denbighshire,</HI> the strong and almost impregnable Castle of <HI>Denbigh.</HI> In <HI>Flintshire, Flint</HI> and <HI>Har∣ding</HI> Castles. In <HI>Glamorganshire, Cardiff,</HI> now belonging to the Earls of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> but once the famous Residence of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Marmion∣with</HI> his 12 Knights, little less renown'd in Story than K. <HI>Arthur</HI> and his Knights of the round Table, and whose Effigies were late∣ly to be seen in the Hall of this Castle.</P>
<P>The Bridges of <HI>England</HI> are not the least of the 7 Remarks of this Nation.</P>
<P>And first, They are remarkable for num∣ber, as being reckon'd in all 875.</P>
<P>In the next place, They plead prece∣dence in the generality with all others in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Prime is <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, which is said to have been anciently built of Wood, and was then accounted a very stately
<PB N="138" REF="75"/>
Bridge; but afterwards receiv'd a far grea∣ter pitch of lustre by being built of Stone, insomuch that without controversie it is judg'd the noblest Structure of that kind in <HI>Europe.</HI> It stands upon 19 Arches of Stone, which support a Street of very fair Edifices, of a quarter of a Mile in length, for so much the breadth of the <HI>Thames</HI> is account∣ed in that place.</P>
<P>The next for Beauty and Magnificence, is that of <HI>Rochester</HI>; and after that the Bridg of <HI>Stratford upon Avon.</HI></P>
<P>Among the three Beauties of the Town of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the Bridge is one, the other two being the Church and Castle.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Ouse,</HI> which encircles the Town of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> all but the North-side, are three fair Bridges of Stone.</P>
<P>The same River <HI>Ouse</HI> runs through the midst of the Town of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and hath over it a handsom Stone-Bridge, with two Gates upon it.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Dee</HI> is a stately Stone-Bridge, which leads to the City of <HI>Chester.</HI> It is supported with 8 Arches, and hath at
<PB N="139" REF="75"/>
each end two strong Gates, from whence the Walls commence, within which the City lyes in an oblong Square.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> a small Brook runs through the Town of <HI>Darby,</HI> (which lyes on the Western-bank of that River) under 9 Bridges. But the stateliest of all is that in the North-East part of the Town, upon which standeth a fair Chappel of Stone.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>VVeer,</HI> with which the City of <HI>Durham</HI> is almost wholly incom∣pass'd, two neat Stone-Bridges, one from the South, the other from the North-Road, lead into the midst of the Town.</P>
<P>The Bridge leading into <HI>VVarwick</HI>-Town, over the River <HI>Avon,</HI> is both sight∣ly and strong.</P>
<P>But particularly sumptuous with their Towers and Gates, are those two over <HI>Se∣vern,</HI> at the East and West Entrances of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI></P>
<P>That over the River <HI>Ouse</HI> at <HI>York,</HI> which stands on each side the River, hath one Arch, the largest and loftiest of any Bridge in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="76"/>Several others there are, and some per∣haps not unworthy of memory, but these being the very chiefest, it will not be worth the while to mention any more.</P>
<P>The grand Ornaments of any City are the publick Buildings thereof; and next to the Churches, Palaces and Bridges, are the Monumental Structures, that present them∣selves most obviously to the view of Passen∣gers in Streets and High-ways, as Aque∣ducts, Arches, and the Columnal or Image∣ry-Works, erected as Trophies in memory of some great Action or Person; as also Pla∣ces for publick Games and Spectacles.</P>
<P>For Structures of this kind, never any City of the World was so famous as old <HI>Rome,</HI> whose Circus's, Amphitheaters, Co∣lumns, Pyramids, Tryumphal Arches, Eque∣strian Statues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> next to the massie Pyra∣mids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> were accounted the greatest Pieces of Art and Magnificence the World ever saw. Nor are the Pyramids, Columns and Aguglia's of the present <HI>Rome,</HI> altoge∣ther unmemorable.</P>
<P>Of Monuments of this nature in <HI>England,</HI> the Crosses erected in Streets and publick Places were the chief. And of those the
<PB N="141" REF="76"/>
principal were <HI>Coventry</HI>-Cross; and in this City <HI>Charing</HI>-Cross, and that of <HI>Cheapside,</HI> which last was certainly the noblest Piece of Workmanship of this nature, as well for the largeness as the curiousness of the Ima∣gery that ever was seen.</P>
<P>Next, The Aqueducts or Conduits have been accounted no small Street-ornaments in many Towns and Cities, but the men∣tion of those that were in <HI>London,</HI> may serve for all the rest.</P>
<P>The chief that were in <HI>London</HI> before the Fire of 66. were the Standart in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> a Structure that might have pass'd for a no∣ble Piece of Workmanship, had it not stood so near so rich a Cross. Another at the lower end of <HI>Cheapside.</HI> Another in <HI>Corn∣hil.</HI> That in <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> hard by <HI>Shoe-lane</HI> end; and another in <HI>Holborn,</HI> near <HI>Holborn</HI>-Bridge, besides several others of less Note. The only Conduit lately erected, now standing, is a pretty little Structure be∣tween <HI>Cow-lane</HI> and <HI>Snow-hill.</HI></P>
<P>Since the Fire, other kind of Monuments have been rais'd, which add not a little to the Ornament of the City in general, and give peculiar Grace to the Places where they
<PB N="142" REF="77" MS="y"/>
stand. The chief whereof is the Monu∣ment erected where the Fire began, a Py∣ramid of stately heighth and curious Work∣manship.</P>
<P>Another Monument much of the same nature is design'd, and the Edifice rais'd some yards above the ground, at the lower end of <HI>Cheapside,</HI> at or very near the Place where the Conduit formerly stood: A ve∣ry rare Design, as appears by the Model which I have often seen at the House of the ingenious Designer thereof, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jasper La∣tham,</HI> the City-Mason.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Stocks-Market</HI> is an Equestrian Statue in Stone of his present Majesty.</P>
<P>And another more excellent than that in Brass, of his late Majesty of happy Memory, in the Place where <HI>Charing-Cross</HI> stood.</P>
<P>In <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Square is a Columnal-Dial, which only wants somewhat of Mag∣nitude to make it a very graceful Ornament to the Place.</P>
<P>Our Theaters at present are only two, That of his Majesty's Servants, between <HI>Bridges-street</HI> and <HI>Drury-lane</HI>; and that of
<PB N="143" REF="77"/>
his Royal Highness's Servants, in <HI>Salisbury-street,</HI> with a majestick Front towards the <HI>Thames</HI> side.</P>
<P>Artificial publick Bagno's have not been known in <HI>England</HI> till of late: The only one yet built is aside of <HI>Newgate-street,</HI> a pretty well contriv'd Piece of Building, had it been more publickly expos'd to view on the Street side.</P>
<P>The Gates of Towns and Cities are not the least of Ornaments to the said Towns and Cities. Of the chief of them, except those in <HI>London,</HI> we have toucht in the re∣spective Places to which they belong. The principal Gates of <HI>London</HI> are <HI>Ludgate, New∣gate, Aldersgate, Algate, Bishopsgate</HI> and <HI>Tem∣ple-bar</HI>; and the two Gates at <HI>Westminster,</HI> between <HI>Whitehal</HI> and <HI>Kings-street,</HI> most of them not inferior in Magnificence to the chief in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But to close all that hath been said of publick Ornaments, there remains one thing more, not to be neglected by any Admirer of Art, which is a Piece of Sculp∣ture in Stone, representing the Resurrecti∣on, over a Gate in <HI>Shoo-lane,</HI> that gives en∣trance
<PB N="144" REF="78"/>
into a Caemetery or Burying-place, which belongs to S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Andrews</HI>-Church. This Piece of Carving I have heard com∣mended by the best of Artists in this way, for the noblest Piece of Workmanship in its kind that hath been seen in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Towns and Places of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> eminent for some remarkeable Accident, Person, or Transaction.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal Things that render any Town or Place remarkable, are either the Glory and Antiquity of its Original, some notable Revolution of Government, Accidents hapning there, whether prospe∣rous or adverse, Battels fought, or other grand Action perform'd in or near it, and the Birth, Residence or Death of Princes, and other eminent Men.</P>
<P>For most if not all of those Remarks, there are many Towns and Cities of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> famous and principally of all, that which is the principal of all our Towns and Cities, <HI>London,</HI> for the most part the Seat of Kings from its Original; with which as the City <HI>Westminster</HI> is so united in Place,

that it seems in a manner one and the same City, so thē mention and discourse of them cannot well be separated. Of the Anti∣quity, Splendor of Government, Flourish∣ing Trade, and Magnificence of Structure, in all which <HI>London</HI> hath the pre-eminence, not only of all the Places of <HI>England,</HI> but perhaps of all <HI>Europe,</HI> several have discours'd at large, besides what we may haply have occasion to touch at elsewhere.</P>
<P>It can't be imagin'd, but that in a City which hath been a flourishing City for so many Ages, many remarkable Accidents must have hapned, and great Actions been perform'd, in the mention whereof how∣ever all possible brevity must be us'd.</P>
<P>King <HI>Lud,</HI> who reign'd here a little be∣fore <HI>Caesar</HI>'s arrival, if he were not the first Founder, as some think, he was at least not only the Enlarger, but also the Denomina∣tor. For among other things he built the West-Gate, which to this day retains the Name of <HI>Ludgate</HI>; and what was before of a City, by the Name of <HI>Trinobantium,</HI> took the Name of <HI>Caer-Lud</HI>; and the present appellation of <HI>London</HI> is fancy'd by many to be deriv'd from him, as it were <HI>Luds-Town.</HI> About the year 285. here <HI>Alectus,</HI> Lieute∣nant to the Emperor <HI>Diocletian,</HI> was slain by <HI>Asclepiodotus,</HI> D. of <HI>Cornwal</HI>; and together
<PB N="147" REF="80"/>
with him was slain his Companion <HI>Gallus,</HI> at a Brook, which from him still retains the name of <HI>Gall-brook,</HI> or <HI>Wall brook.</HI> Here <HI>Sigebert,</HI> third King of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> who began his Reign in the year of our Lord 596. and <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> who be∣gan his Reign in the year of our Lord 562. built the Cathedral of St. <HI>Pauls</HI> in the ve∣ry place, as 'tis said, where there had been a Temple of <HI>Diana.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Ed∣mund,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Ironside,</HI> this City was close∣ly besieg'd by the <HI>Danes,</HI> but the Siege was soon rais'd by that valiant Prince King <HI>Ed∣mund.</HI> About the year 1077. the Tower of <HI>London</HI> was built by K. <HI>William</HI> the Con∣queror, whose Successour K. <HI>William Rufus</HI> built new walls about it. <HI>Anno</HI> 1135. in the Reign of K. <HI>Stephen</HI> the greatest part of this City was consumed by an accidental Fire. In K. <HI>Richard</HI> the Seconds time was the great Rencounter with <HI>Jack Straw</HI> and <HI>Wat Tiler</HI> in <HI>East-Smithfield,</HI> where in an overture of treaty <HI>Wat Tiler</HI> behaving him∣self with extraordinary insolence, was in presence of the King stabb'd by Sir <HI>William Wallworth,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> with a Dagger, in memory whereof the City of <HI>London</HI> hath to this day a Dagger for its Coat of <HI>Arms.</HI> This City hath had the honour to entertain several great Kings,
<PB N="148" REF="81"/>
Princes, and Nobles; but the grandest transaction that <HI>London</HI> can boast of, was that most stately Cavalcade which his pre∣sent Majesty made through it the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May An.</HI> 1660. when he returned from a long Exile to the Government of these Kingdoms: But the year 1666. was fatal to it by reason of that most dreadful fire that consum'd all before it from <HI>Grace-Church</HI> Street to the Inner Temple, de∣stroying to the number, as is generally com∣puted, of 13000 dwelling-houses; and this preceded but the year before by the fiercest Pestilence that ever raged within the cog∣nisance of the Weekly Bills. In this City King <HI>Stephen</HI> kept his Court at <HI>Crosby-house</HI> in <HI>Bishopsgate-street</HI>; King <HI>Edward</HI> the third in <HI>Cornhil</HI> where now the Pope-head Ta∣vern stands; King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth at <HI>Black-friers,</HI> and sometimes at <HI>Bridewell,</HI> once a Regal Palace, where also the Em∣perour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth was lodg'd when he came over into <HI>England.</HI> The Palace of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, which is in the <HI>Pomaeria</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and which was first built for a Spittle for Maiden Lepers, hath been the Birth-place of his present Majesty K. <HI>Charles</HI> the 2<SUP>d</SUP>, his Highness <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York, Henry</HI> late Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> late Princess of
<PB N="149" REF="81"/>
<HI>Orange,</HI> and all the Children of his pre∣sent Highness by his late Dutchess; <HI>Edgar</HI> Duke of <HI>Kendal, James</HI> Duke of <HI>Cambridg,</HI> deceast; the Lady <HI>Henrietta</HI> and the Lady Lady <HI>Katherine</HI> deceast; <HI>Mary</HI> now Princess of <HI>Orange,</HI> the Lady <HI>Anne</HI> yet unmarried; as also of two Daughters (both soon ha∣sten'd to a better World) by his present Dutchess. Other persons of eminent note and immortal memory were born at <HI>London, viz. Thomas Becket</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 2<SUP>d</SUP>, by four of whese Courtiers he was mur∣ther'd in <HI>Canterbury</HI> Church, <HI>Anno</HI> 1170. after a long contest with the King; Sir <HI>Jeoffry Chaucer</HI> the most famous of ancient <HI>English Poets,</HI> who flourisht in the Reigns of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<SUP>th</SUP>, <HI>Henry</HI> the 5<SUP>th</SUP>, and part of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 6<SUP>th</SUP>. <HI>Edmund Spencer,</HI> styl'd also the Prince of English Poets, who flourisht in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth; John Leland,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> Bishop <HI>An∣drews.</HI> The Tower of <HI>London</HI> is very emi∣nent for the Confinement, Murther, and Execution of Illustrious persons: to men∣tion all, especially those who have been meerly Prisoners, would be almost endless; but the most memorable Imprisonment was that of two Kings at one time in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="82"/>
King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and of <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>France</HI>; the first a Prisoner 11 years, the other four. Here the unfortunate King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, after <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth had got the Crown from him by Conquest, was basely mur∣ther'd by King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Brother <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> afterward King of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> Here <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> ano∣ther Brother, was by the practice of the said Duke of <HI>Glocester,</HI> drown'd in a Butt of <HI>Malmsey:</HI> but the most fatal Tragedy of all was the murther of King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth's two Sons, poor harmless children, <HI>viz. Edward</HI> commonly entitled King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the fifth, and his Brother <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and all by the order and contrivement of their <HI>Dear</HI> Uncle of <HI>Glo∣cester,</HI> who, as most great persons have their peculiar Sports and Recreations, was prin∣cipally taken with that of killing men, e∣specially those of nearest kin; for such he chiefly markt out for death out of meer kindness to himself, that he might the soon∣er obtain the possession of that Crown he had long since aspir'd to: and indeed he got it sooner, and kept it longer: (so easie it is for one witty man to delude a Multi∣tude,) than a curious descanter upon the worlds affairs would have allow'd a person so getting it; however what he got by
<PB N="151" REF="82"/>
the death of others he lost by his own, on∣ly more handsomely, not by treachery, but fairly in the field.</P>
<P>In <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>London</HI> three great Queens had their Sepulture, <HI>viz. Margaret</HI> the Daughter of King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>France</HI> sir∣named the Hardy, and second Wife of King <HI>Edward</HI> the second of <HI>England. Isabel</HI> the Daughter of the French King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fair, and Wife to King <HI>Edward</HI> the second of <HI>England. Joan</HI> the Daughter of the said <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Isabel,</HI> and married to <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Westminster</HI> hath been the most constant residence of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> since the Conquest, till <HI>Whitehall</HI> was built by Car∣dinal <HI>Wolsey.</HI> It will be needless to men∣tion all the Kings that have been crown'd and buried here, in regard since the Con∣quest there are not very many who have not been buried, and fewer that have not been crown'd in <HI>Westminster</HI> Abby.</P>
<P>At <HI>Isleworth,</HI> now <HI>Thistleworth,</HI> a Village pleasantly situate upon the River <HI>Thames, Richard</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> had a stately Palace, which was burnt to the ground in a tumultuous sally that was made upon it by certain Malecon∣tents of the <HI>London</HI> Mobile.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="83"/>In <HI>Surry</HI> are places of as eminent note as in most Counties of <HI>England.</HI> In the first place <HI>Lambeth</HI> is chiefly renowned for be∣ing the principal Palace and most usual residence of the Archbishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> from the time of Archbishop <HI>Baldwin</HI> who first founded it, and made it his Seat in the year 596, and from whom it hath con∣tinued so to this day, the most reverend and learned Prelate Dr. <HI>Sancroft</HI> late Dean of <HI>Pauls,</HI> being worthily advanc'd to this high Dignity, and having here his present residence. Here <HI>Canutus</HI> sirnamed the <HI>Har∣dy,</HI> the third and last of our short-liv'd Dy∣nasty of <HI>Danish</HI> Kings, ended his days of a surfeit, as most Writers affirm, by eating and drinking over freely at a Wedding Feast.</P>
<P><HI>Croydon</HI> is another Seat belonging to the Archbishops of <HI>Canterbury</HI>; and where the Reverend Dr. <HI>Gilbert Sheldon,</HI> late Archbi∣shop, lies buried, having a most statety Mo∣nument newly elected to his memory, the Artful Contrivance and skilful Workman∣ship of Mr <HI>Jasper Latham,</HI> the present City Mason.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ockly</HI> in this County <HI>Ethelwolph</HI> Son of <HI>Egbert</HI> won a great Battel over the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="83"/><HI>Oatlands</HI> is not more famous for being a Royal Palace, than for the Neighbourhood of <HI>Coweystakes</HI> where <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> pass'd the <HI>Thames</HI> into the Borders of <HI>Cassibe∣saunus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Putney</HI> is chiefly considerable in story as being the Birth-place of one of the most advanced Statesmen and Favourites (for he was but the Son of a Black-smith) that our Nation hath produced, <HI>viz. Thomas Cromwell,</HI> chief Minister of State, for the time, to King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and by him created Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who nevertheless had the ill fate, falling under his Princes displeasure, to be beheaded on <HI>Tower-Hill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wimbleton</HI> (where the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> hath a pleasant seat) still retains the me∣mory of a notable defeat given by <HI>Cheaulin</HI> King of the West-Saxons to <HI>Ethelred</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> with the slaughter of two of his Dukes in the year of our Lord 560.</P>
<P>At <HI>Richmond,</HI> to which in former ages the Kings and Queens of <HI>England</HI> retired for pleasure, as of late to <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> and <HI>Windsor,</HI> there deceased that victorious Prince King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Anne</HI> the Daughter of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth, and Wife of King <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Richmond</HI> the seventh of that name King of <HI>England,</HI> and that learned
<PB N="154" REF="84"/>
and renowned Princess Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of happy memory.</P>
<P><HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames</HI> a very pleasant and much frequented Market Town, was pro∣bably the usual place of Coronation of the Saxon Monarchs; for there was kept the Chair of Instalment: but the Kings most particularly mentioned to have been there crown'd, were King <HI>Athelstan, Edwin,</HI> and <HI>Ethelred.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Guilford</HI> a Town otherwise of especial note, is also famous for having been the Royal Seat of the <HI>English</HI> Saxon Kings.</P>
<P><HI>Merton</HI> is doubly upon record, first for the untimely death of <HI>Kenulph</HI> King of the West-Saxons, who was here slain by <HI>Kine∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> King <HI>Sigeberts</HI> Brother; next for the Parliament there held <HI>An.</HI> 21 of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the third, which Parliament produc'd an Act, which to this day is called the Statute of <HI>Merton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Okeham</HI> hath its chief credit as being the native place of that famous English Philo∣sopher <HI>William de Okeham.</HI> Likewise</P>
<P><HI>Ripley</HI> no less by the birth of that learned Chymist <HI>George de Ripley.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Essex, Colchester,</HI> which is the County Town, hath the honourable tradition of having been built by the ancient British
<PB N="155" REF="84"/>
King <HI>Coilus</HI>; but that which redounds chiefly to its honour, is, that it is said to have brought into the world three persons of immortal memory, <HI>viz. Lucius</HI> the first not only <HI>British,</HI> but <HI>European</HI> King that embrac'd the Christian Faith. <HI>Constantine</HI> the first <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, who openly pro∣professing Christianity, gave countenance and protection to the Christians of all parts, and put an end to those heavy Persecutions which they groaned under so many Ages; and if by his extraordinary bounty and mu∣nificence to the Clergy, he made an inlet to that pride and ambition among them, which hath proved mischievous to Chri∣stendome ever since, it was an errour on the right hand, and however succeeding otherwise, an evidence of his pious gene∣rosity and zeal for Religion and Vertue. <HI>Helena</HI> the Wife of <HI>Constantius,</HI> born also in <HI>England,</HI> and, as it is generally suppos'd, in <HI>York,</HI> and Mother of the said <HI>Constantine</HI>: her fame shines bright in History for her piety in general, and particularly for the fame of her being <HI>Inventrix Crucis.</HI></P>
<P>The next Town of note in this County is <HI>Maldon,</HI> a very ancient Town, and the Seat Royal of the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> of whom <HI>Cunobelinus</HI> was King about the time of our
<PB N="156" REF="85"/>
Saviours Nativity; it was taken by the Emperour <HI>Claudius,</HI> and made a <HI>Roman</HI> Garison, being call'd by the <HI>Romans Cama∣lodunum,</HI> rased to the ground by Queen <HI>Bunduca</HI> or <HI>Boadicia,</HI> after a mighty defeat given to the <HI>Romans</HI> in revenge of some high affronts and indignities she received from them, but was afterwards rebuilt, and is of some reputation at this day, though doubtless far short of its pristine splendor.</P>
<P>At <HI>Walden,</HI> famous for Saffron as is alrea∣dy mentioned, was born Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Secretary to Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kent,</HI> as it is a large County, is enobled with very many Towns and places of note; in the first place <HI>Canterbury</HI> is a City of that eminence, that next to <HI>London</HI> there is hard∣ly a City in <HI>England</HI> memorable upon so many accounts: It is said to have been built 900 years before Christ: it is the prin∣cipal of the <HI>Archiepiscopal</HI> Sees of <HI>England</HI>; it was given by <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> to <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk and his Companions, upon whose preaching 10000 were baptized in one day. By the said <HI>Austin</HI> the Cathedral is said to have been founded, in which eight Kings of <HI>Kent</HI> were interred. Even the misfortunes of this City have been also memorable, for it suffer'd very much se∣veral
<PB N="157" REF="85"/>
times by the fury of the <HI>Danes,</HI> espe∣cially in the Reign of <HI>Ethelred,</HI> when 42000 of the Inhabitants were sacrific'd to their fury and revenge; it hath had the honour of the Coronations, Nuptials and Inter∣ments of several great Kings and Princes. Here King <HI>John</HI> and his Queen <HI>Isabel</HI> were Crown'd, King <HI>Henry</HI> the third and King <HI>Edward</HI> the first Married: <HI>Edward</HI> the Black Prince, King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth and his Q. <HI>Joan</HI> were Interred: and also with far more cost and magnificence that great Pre∣late, and even to adoration adored Saint <HI>Thomas a Becket,</HI> of whose rich and stately, Tomb mention hath been elsewhere made.</P>
<P><HI>Rochester</HI> said to be built by one <HI>Roff</HI> Lord thereof, is also a City, and not much inferiour in repute to <HI>Canterbury.</HI> Several Counties there are which have no City, the Bishops See being but in one of half a dozen Counties, but <HI>Kent</HI> is the only one County that hath two. This City was al∣so miserably harrass'd by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and suffer'd very much ruine by two dreadful Fires, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first and King <HI>Henry</HI> the second; but being very much restored by the munificence of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, it hath continued a flourishing City ever since.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="86"/><HI>Maidstone,</HI> a pleasant and well-seated Town is the more memorable by the great defeat given there to the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who headed the Kentish-men rising for the King, by <HI>Fairfax</HI> General of the Parlia∣ment Forces.</P>
<P><HI>Feversham</HI> is enobled by the Burial of King <HI>Stephen</HI> and his Queen <HI>Maud.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dover,</HI> besides the renown of its Castle, said to be built by <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> and the great honour of the Government thereof, hath given reception and entertainment to many great Kings and Princes.</P>
<P><HI>Queenborough</HI> Castle was built by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third.</P>
<P><HI>Wye,</HI> a Sea-port Town, where the learn∣ed and famous <HI>J. Kemp</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> was born.</P>
<P><HI>Horsted</HI> is chiefly noted for the Monu∣ment now defaced of <HI>Horsa,</HI> one of the first Leaders of the invading <HI>Saxons,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Hengift.</HI></P>
<P>The like Monument was made for <HI>Cati∣gern,</HI> another of the Brothers, at <HI>Circotes-house,</HI> which is standing to this day.</P>
<P><HI>Black-heath</HI> hath been the place of several grand Recounters in the Barons Wars in King <HI>Henry</HI> the third's time, as also of <HI>Wat Tiler</HI> in King <HI>Richard</HI> the second's time, and of <HI>Michael Joseph</HI> and the Lord <HI>d' Au∣henie</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="86"/>
in King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh's time. But that which gives the greatest glory and re-renown to this place, is the memory of that grand appearance at his Majesties Re∣storation, when all the Gentry and Nobi∣lity of the Nation, and all the Pomp and splendor of the City of <HI>London</HI> met to re∣ceive his Majesty and his two Brothers, and conduct them through the City to the Roy∣al Palace of <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and even the armed part of the Nation that but lately had drawn the Sword against him, now met him with the highest acclamations of wel∣come.</P>
<P>In <HI>Buckinghamshire, Buckingham</HI> the Shire Town was fortified by King <HI>Edward</HI> sir∣named the <HI>Elder,</HI> against the fury of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and still shews the ruins of a strong and stately Castle built upon a hill.</P>
<P><HI>Stony-Stratford</HI> was a Station of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> and by them call'd <HI>Lactorodum.</HI> Here the said King <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Elder</HI>▪ gave a stop to the violent incursions of the <HI>Danes</HI> up∣on those parts; and this is one of those pla∣ces where the first of that name since the Conquest rais'd a stately monumental Cross in memory of Queen <HI>Eleanor.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Chilton</HI> in this Shire was born that learned Writer in the Law Sir <HI>George Crook.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="87"/><HI>Amersham,</HI> so call'd <HI>qu. Agmondsham,</HI> is not only eminent by the name of the great <HI>Agmond,</HI> from whom it takes denomina∣tion, but by the birth of several learned Writers, especially <HI>John,</HI> sirnamed from the place of his Nativity, <HI>Amersham</HI>; and <HI>John Gregory</HI> of the present Age, whose posthume works are worthily reckon'd a∣mong the principal of English Writings.</P>
<P>At <HI>Windover</HI> was born <HI>Roger,</HI> thence sir∣named <HI>de Windover,</HI> Historian to King <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P>At <HI>Houton, Roger Goad,</HI> a man of good repute for learning.</P>
<P>In <HI>Barkshire</HI> are several places of note. <HI>Reading</HI> boasts the Interment of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, in a Collegiate Church of an Abby founded by himself, together with his Queen and his Daughter <HI>Maud</HI> the Em∣press. He also built here a strong Castle which was rased to the ground by King <HI>Henry</HI> the second. But this Town is yet more remark'd by the birth of <HI>William Laud,</HI> who of a poor Clothiers Son of <HI>Reading,</HI> was advanc'd to the highest Ec∣clesiastical Office and Dignity of the Nati∣on, <HI>viz.</HI> the Archiepiscopal See of <HI>Canter∣bury:</HI> nor is it to be forgotten how man∣fully this Town was held out in the time

of the late Civil War by Sir <HI>Jacob Aston</HI> a∣gainst the whole power of the Earl of <HI>Es∣sex,</HI> General of the Parliaments forces for a whole twelve month's time, but at length it was taken by the said Earl. And from this place, in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the second a learned Writer, <HI>viz. Hugh</HI> of <HI>Reading,</HI> took both Birth and Sirname.</P>

<P><HI>Bosworth,</HI> a Town of no great note but for the memory of a most signal battle fought near it on <HI>Redemore, August</HI> 22<SUP>d</SUP> 1485. which put an end to all Controversies between the two houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and in which fell that most Tyrannical of <HI>English</HI> Kings <HI>Richard</HI> the third, with four thousand of his men, and some say, though we are not bound to believe it, with the loss but of ten men on the Earl of <HI>Richmonds</HI> side.</P>
<P><HI>Cleycester</HI> of which there are now scarce any ruins remaining, was once a famous City in the West part of this Shire, and by the <HI>Romans</HI> call'd <HI>Bennone.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wainfleet</HI> had been doubtless a place of little note, but for the birth of <HI>William Wain∣fleet</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who living in the reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, with whom he was great in favour, built here a Free-School, and founded <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Grimsby</HI> likewise though an ancient Mar∣ket Town, hath its chiefest repute from its being the Birth-place of Dr. <HI>Whitgift</HI> Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the reign of King <HI>James.</HI></P>

Here also <HI>Constantius Chlorus,</HI> the Father of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, is said to have depar∣ted this life; nor does the death of these two Emperours more ennoble this Place, than the Birth of the Learned <HI>Alcuin,</HI> who was Tu∣tour to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Great.

<P><HI>Wakefield</HI> is a Town not more considera∣ble for its Cloathing, than for the memo∣ry of a great battle fought between the Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> besides a de∣feat given in the late Civil Wars to the Earl of <HI>Newcastles</HI> Forces by Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Exeter</HI> in <HI>Devonshire</HI> is both of sufficient antiquity, for the Castle call'd <HI>Rugemont,</HI> was once the Palace of the West-<HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and afterwards of the Earls of <HI>Corn∣wal,</HI> and the Walls and Cathedral were built by King <HI>Athelstan</HI>; and also memora∣ble for several transactions; here was born that most renowned <HI>Latin</HI> Poet of <HI>England, Josephus,</HI> hence sirnamed <HI>Iscanus,</HI> or <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Exeter.</HI></P>

And, for Garlic, doubtless, this County abounds in general with this sort of Plant, for that it is much eaten by the <HI>Cornish</HI> men; whose Health and Longaevity is, by many, imputed to their frequent feeding upon this <HI>Country man's Treacle,</HI> as they call it.</P>
<P><HI>Dorcetshire,</HI> especially the Isle of <HI>Portland,</HI> or thereabouts, produces a rare sort of Plant, which is accounted much of the same
<PB N="258" REF="136"/>
nature, if not the same, with that which the <HI>Greeks</HI> called <HI>Isidis Plocamos.</HI> But, par∣ticularly, <HI>Birdport,</HI> in this Shire, is noted for the excellent Hemp growing therea∣bout.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dengeness</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> Holly Trees grow thick for a Mile in length, among Beech and Pebbles.</P>
<P><HI>Axholm</HI> in <HI>Shropshire</HI> is noted for a sort of Shrub called Galls, growing peculiarly thereabout.</P>
<P>About <HI>Keinsham</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> great store of <HI>Percepier,</HI> or Parsely Break Stone.</P>
<P>Neither is Fern so inconsiderable a Plant, but that <HI>Cambden</HI> takes notice of abundance of it growing about <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P>But in <HI>Sabernacle</HI> Forest in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> there is a sort of Fern more remarkable than or∣dinary, by reason of the sweetness of its scent.</P>
<P>Several Fruits, and Flowers, and other Plants have not been known in <HI>England,</HI> till of late Ages. First Pippins and Cher∣ries, as hath been already intimated, and as Mr. <HI>Leonard Mascal</HI> of <HI>Plumstead</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's-Gardiner observes, af∣ter that, Apricots, about the fifteenth of the said King's Reign. And about the same time, Hops from <HI>Artois.</HI> Some say Apri∣cots, Malacotoons and Muscmelons came
<PB N="259" REF="136"/>
in about the twentieth of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth.</HI> Others say, Melon-seeds were first sent out of <HI>Italy,</HI> to King <HI>James,</HI> and the Stem of a yellow Rose, which flowers from <HI>May</HI> till <HI>Christmas.</HI> Choice Flowers were first in use and reputation at <HI>Norwich,</HI> by means of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who first brought them thither. The latest are Gillyflowers and Carnations, the Province and Red Rose, and that of <HI>Jericho:</HI> Also the Tulip (per∣haps the Lilly, of the Valley) and the White-Chappel Flower. Moreover, Ar∣tichoaks and Asparagus, Oranges and Le∣mons, are but of late date here. As like∣wise, both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Smirna</HI> Corants; perhaps the soonest of them about an hun∣dred and fifty years since. Tobacco was first brought into <HI>England</HI> by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> though never thought fit to be planted. About the same time came in Sugar. The first planting of Mulberries was about <HI>Anno</HI> 1609.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Flax, <HI>Staffordshire, Shropshire,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Man</HI> are particularly mentioned; and the last for Hemp. Also <HI>Tewksbury</HI> in <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the Wonders of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Monument of Stones at <HI>Stanton Drew,</HI> near <HI>Pensford,</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> deserves a particular description, but much more that of <HI>Aubury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> about four Miles West from <HI>Marleborough.</HI> About this Village is cast a Ditch of a prodigious depth; <HI>viz.</HI> as deep as that of <HI>Winchester,</HI> which is the deepest that hath been obser∣ved: and, not without (as usually) but within this Ditch is raised a very high Bank, or Trench, not in a form absolutely Circular, but somewhat near. Within the Trench, and answerable to the form thereof, Stones are set round, excepting those Gaps which appear to have been made by the Invasion of the Villagers upon these Stones, with Sledges, for their use in Building. Within this prodigious Round of Ditch, Bank and Stones, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Village: and two Piles of these large Stones, <HI>viz.</HI> about eighteen, nineteen or twenty Foot high, in a manner, somewhat Circular, bur pretty compact together: but the Church stands wholly without the Round of the Ditch. Moreover, there is another thing no less remarkable than the rest,
<PB N="261" REF="137"/>
namely, a streight Walk made by two long Tracts of Stone, about five, six or seven Foot high on either hand, of about a Mile long, leading, as an Avenue, to the said Work. And, at the beginning thereof, two other Tracts, which make another Walk, leading on the Right Hand to two other Circles of Stone, one within another, The River <HI>Kinnel</HI> running just underneath.</P>
<P>This Description, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether with a Deli∣neation of the Stones at <HI>Stanton Drew,</HI> I received from a particular friend, Mr. <HI>John Aubrey,</HI> of the Royal Society; a person of much worth and ingenuity; but, most especially curious in the search of Antiqui∣ties. And this favour is so much the greater, for that before he had designed the Description thereof himself, in a Work he intends to publish, Entituled <HI>Monumen∣ta Britanica.</HI></P>

<P>Near <HI>Flamborough-Head</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> are certain Waters called <HI>Vipsies,</HI> which flow out of Neighbouring Springs every other Year; and fall with a violent Stream into the Sea.</P>
<P>On <HI>Cadier Arthur Hill</HI> in <HI>Cheshire</HI> is a Spring, deep as a Well, and four square, and having no Streams; but there are Trouts found in it.</P>
<P>To the Medicinal Wells, already men∣tioned, lately found out, may be added, that of <HI>Sellenge,</HI> and that of <HI>Egerton,</HI> near <HI>Lenham</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI>; both which were disco∣vered about forty years since; and the last turns Wood into Stone.</P>

<HEAD>To the Manufactures and Inventions of <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MAsons, Painting and Glasing first brought into <HI>England,</HI> by <HI>Benedict, Anno</HI> 728.</P>
<P><HI>Antonio Bonese,</HI> an <HI>Italian,</HI> first taught the <HI>English</HI> to spin with a Distaff, 20 <HI>H.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>Fine <HI>Spanish</HI> Needles were made in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> Reign, by a <HI>Negro</HI> in Cheap∣side, who refused co communicate his Art; but it was afterwards taught by <HI>Elias Crouse,</HI> a <HI>German, Anno</HI> 8<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>Elizabethae.</HI></P>
<P>In the tenth year of the said Queen, <HI>Ri∣chard Dyer</HI> came from <HI>Spain,</HI> and taught his Country-men the way of making Earthen Fire-Pots, Furnaces and Transportable Ovens for baking of Earthen Ware. He had the first sole profit by Patent, <HI>Anno</HI> 1555.</P>
<P><HI>Walter Rippon</HI> is said to have made the first Coach in <HI>England</HI>: for the Earl of <HI>Rut∣land, Anno</HI> 1564. a hollow turning Coach: for the Queen: <HI>Anno</HI> 1585. a rare Chariot.</P>
<P>Others say, <HI>William Boonen,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI>-man, Coach-man to Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> first brought the use of the Coach into <HI>England.</HI> And about the same time came in Long Waggons.</P>
<P>Making of Copperas in <HI>England</HI> was first practised by <HI>Cornelius de Vos,</HI> a Merchant, <HI>An.</HI> 1587.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="140"/><HI>William Saunders,</HI> a Fishmonger, was the first that brought our Caelestial and Terrestrial Globes to any considerable per∣fection; but since, they have been much improved.</P>
<P><HI>William Matthews,</HI> in the 5th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was the first rare Artist in the making of fine Knives and Hafts, which were marked with a Half Moon; and for which he had the Queens Letters Patents.</P>
<P>About the same time Pins, which were formerly brought in by Strangers, to the value of 60000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> were first made in <HI>England</HI>; and now excell all that are made in any other part of the World.</P>
<P>One <HI>Bourass</HI> first made the Engin for Scale-Board.</P>
<P>One <HI>Ross</HI> is said to have been the first that made Bandores in <HI>England</HI>: and, to this, day, that called the <HI>Ross</HI> Viol is ac∣counted the choicest of all other Viols.</P>
<P>The ancient way among us of keeping Accounts was by Tallies; and is, in some measure, and on some occasions, retained to this day. The most considerable instance is, in the Tallies of the Exchequer. And, not only common Accounts, but the Ac∣count of Time, and the Motions of the Sun, Moon, and other Planets, anciently in some parts of <HI>Derbyshire</HI> (and some say, <HI>Stafford∣shire</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="140"/>
also) were usually notched and mar∣ked out upon a piece of Wood. This sort of Calender-Log, or Wooden Alma∣nack, hath scarce been taken notice of, till of late; and now some few there are who understand the way of it. The only one I have seen of them, is in the custody of Mr. <HI>John Bagford,</HI> a Searcher into Antiquities, Arts and Ingenuities, much above what might be expected from one of his Educa∣tion and Literature.</P>
<P>An Engin for Clock-Wheels was inven∣ted about a hundred years since. An En∣gine for the speedy cutting down of Wheels for Watches, forty years ago, none now made after the same manner.</P>
<P>An Engin for drawing of Pinion Wire, of Steel for Watches, about ten years ago.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tomakee,</HI> about ten years since, was famous for making Chains for Watches especially, as being the first. His Wife lives in <HI>Rose</HI> Street, near <HI>Long Acre.</HI></P>
<P>Other late Inventions there are, not un∣worthy to be mentioned. An Engin for Rasing of Glass, an Engin for Spinning of Glass, the Engin for Cutting Tobacco, the Rolling Press for Printing off from Copper Plates, Damask Linnen, and the Watering of Silks. The way of separating Gold from Silver. Enamelling in Gold, Silver and Brass;
<PB N="268" REF="141"/>
Boulting Mills, Dark Lanthorns, the Trum∣pet-makers Trade, Cane-Chairs; a choice way of Colouring, used by Book-binders; boyling of Whalebone, making of Horn∣ware. Perriwigs, Womens Masks, Busks, and Fans, and Muffs are said to have come in here about the time of the <HI>Paris</HI>-Mas∣sacre.</P>
<P>The first pair of black Silk Stockins in <HI>England</HI> presented to Queen <HI>Elizabeth, An∣no</HI> 1660.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> reputed by some, the first Improver of our late Models of Ships.</P>
<P>The best Saddle-Trees are said to be made at <HI>Burford</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and some parts of the North of <HI>England.</HI> The best Riding-Whips at S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Edmundbury</HI> in <HI>Suf∣folk.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the Fire-Engin above mentioned, there is lately brought into use a portable one, of extraordinary advantage, in re∣gard it is capable of being directed into any particular Room or Chamber.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>THat Inland &amp; Maritim Trade &amp; Traf∣fick are (with Gods Blessings on mens Indeavours) the chief Pillars and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upport of all Nations, and from whence
<PB N="2" REF="148"/>
they had their first rise and greatness is so evident that Arguments to prove it would be ineffectual; yet from the World's Ori∣ginal it had not it's perfection, nor indeed could it till Mankind increased, and by spread∣ing wide in the Earth, Peopled it's vast Immensity; nor then, for some thousands of Years was it National, but rather in se∣cret between man and man, few People knowing the Benefit of any other commo∣dities then what were of the native growth of those Countries they inhabited; nor so could Riches abound, for Coyn was for the most part useless, or indeed not mentioned till the days of <HI>Abraham</HI> the Patriarck; Exchange of Goods being the only Traffick▪ and consequently on that score few Traded for more then they had pre∣sent occasion to use, by Reason many things were not of lasting quality, and for that they for the most part Travelled from place to place. Their chiefest Riches consisted in Cattle, but at last when they Builded Ci∣ties and Towns, and found the conveni∣ency of a Settlement they extended their Traffick farther, and one City Traded with another, which still spread wider; yet long was it 'er they found means to plough the Bosom of the Sea, and to hold Commerce and Traffick with remote Nations, which no
<PB N="3" REF="148"/>
sooner was brought to my Perfection, but Riches abounding, and Plenty Flowing in on every side, men then (and not till then) began to give their thoughts large scope, and not contented with the Portion of Earth alotted them, began to grow emulous &amp; aspire to universal Soveraignty; as likewise to plant Colonies in (till then) unhabitable Islands▪ which had not Shipping been invented must have continued without inhabitants; as at this time (past doubt) for want of disco∣very many do in the remote Seas, especial¦ly under the Artick Pole, whose extremi∣ty renders them unaccessible, or at least un∣habitable; and of all Nations the <HI>Greeks</HI> were the first that brought Navigation to any Perfection, by which they grew o∣pulent and extended their Colonies to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> utmost Orient, acquiring the Empire of the then known World; their Fame growing every where great, nor could the <HI>Romans</HI> bring their Warlike Expeditions to any perfection till they were Lords of the Sea, and inriched themselves by Traffick, bringing into that one City the Stores of all Nati∣ons; so that from Cottages of Shepherds, who lay'd her first Foundation, she soon became Magnificent, thrusting up her Lof∣ty Spires, bedecked with Gold so high that they in a manner kissed the Clouds, and
<PB N="4" REF="149"/>
rendered her the awfull Mistriss of the Uni∣verse; and by Trade and Industry, more then by Arms, kept up her Reputation for six hundred Years, when ranging the World to find out Countries unconquered, at last, from <HI>Gallia,</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> under the leading of <HI>Caesar,</HI> they entered <HI>Brittain</HI>; a Place then wild and rude, not knowing how to use the abundant plenty that Nature be∣stowed upon them, but refusing all manner of Dainties, fed upon Roots of Herbs, and Barks of Trees; not Tilling any Ground, nor sowing Corn, otherwise then scatter∣ing it on the untilled Surface of the Earth, and harrowing it over with Bushes, suf∣fering their Cattle, Fowl, and Fish, of which they had store, to continue useless, scarcely knowing any shoar but their own: Their Traffick, or Merchandise, for the most part amongst themselves, and that but mean; their chief Riches consisting (as <HI>Strabo</HI> saith) in Ivory-Boxes, Sheers, Onches, Bitts, Bridles, Chains of Iron, Wreaths, Glass coloured and the like, which they usually delivered to each other as currant Coyn, for what their necessity required; but no sooner had the <HI>Romans</HI> Civilized them, and instructed them in such Arts as were most sutable to their Capacities, and might stand them in greatest stead, but
<PB N="5" REF="149"/>
they began to Build Houses (living before for the most in Huts, and going naked) and turned their Leather Boats into Tall Ships, Furrowing the Seas broad back, and discovering many Nations, to them, till then, unknown: So that by Traffick abroad, and Improvement at home, this Island grew famous, and spread it's Name to the ut∣most Limit of the known Earth; so that being rightly termed the Store-House of the Western World, all the Neighbour-Nations Traded hither; so that those Ports and Havens that were for a long time use∣less, were now filled with Ships of all Na∣tions: So that Silver and Gold was had in Abundance, and Coyns in imitation of those the <HI>Romans</HI> Stamped with the Effigies of their Kings and Princes, which then were many, each County containing two or three, and they for the most part at variance a∣mongst themselves, which gave the <HI>Romans</HI> an opportunity to become Conquerors at an easier rate then otherwise they could.</P>
<P>During the four hundred Years and odd that the <HI>Romans</HI> Governed here by their Lievetenants, and sometimes by their Em∣perors in Person; <HI>Rome,</HI> and after her <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the new Seat of Empire, abounded with our Stores, so that more Tribute was pay'd by this Island then by
<PB N="6" REF="150"/>
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> tho Ten times as large; but the fame of <HI>Brittains</HI> Wealth proved her unhappyness, for the <HI>Goth</HI> breaking in upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, whose spread∣ing Top was too large to be supported by the slender Bole, her Branches was torn off on every side, so that to support their own, the <HI>Romans</HI> were forced to recall their Legions, who took with them the Flower of the Brittish-Youth, and left her open to the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>wild-Irish,</HI> who spoiled and wasted all her pleasant Places with Fire and Sword, and after them the <HI>Saxons</HI> (who were called in to expell them) far worse, so that of a Flourishing Island, it became for many Years a place of Ruin and deso∣lation, all her Nobility Slain, and the re∣sidue of her Natives forced to betake them∣selves to the Fastnesses of Mountains, so that Strangers having grasped the Scepter, which then Multiplyed into seven, from thence called the Heptarchy of the <HI>Saxons</HI> Trade again ceased, all the Ships either Sunk or Burnt in the Ports; but no sooner was the Bloody Tempest over, but the wounded Island again began to lift up her Head. Forraign Nations again came in with the growths of their distant Soil, and so she again became a Store-House of Wealth; but especially, when the sole Monarchy was
<PB N="7" REF="150"/>
reduced under <HI>Egbert</HI> the nineteenth King of the <HI>West-Saxons</HI>—under whom things Flourished in a peaceful manner. But soon after, as if Fate had envied her happyness, the <HI>Danes</HI> (no less Bloody then the <HI>Sax∣ons</HI> had been) made an Invasion, tempted by the glittering Wealth of this fair Isle, and never left off till they had grasped the Scepter, and reduced it to the obedience of <HI>Canute,</HI> under whom again she Flourished more then ever, and so continued to do (Trade increasing and Arts duly improv∣ed) till the Conquest by the Norman-Duke, who for a while put a stop to her aspiring, yet soon after gave incouragements to Industry by Grants, Charters, and large immunities; and from him, through the Reigns of several Peaceful Kings, the cur∣rent of her Prosperity continued. Maritim affairs being prosecuted with such Success, that our Sailers began to Plough (till then) unknown Seas, and so Succesfully that they brought home great store of Riches, open∣ing a way to those that succeeded, to bring to perfection what at this day renders us happy in all temporal Blessings.</P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded in general to shew what <HI>Brittain</HI> has been in her infancy, I shall now proceed to give the Reader an account of such matters as have more im∣mediately
<PB N="8" REF="151"/>
conduced to the prosperous and Flourishing Estate, wherein she has for ma∣ny Years past remained, and does at pre∣sent remain; which chiefly, next Heaven, we must attribute to her store of Shipping, and Expertness in Navigation, so long in∣couraged by her indulgent Kings, who in Peace and War have maintained the So∣veraignty of the Seas with Navies almost incredible; so that no Neighbour-Nation durst disturb our Traffick. Not to insist up∣on King <HI>Arthure,</HI> who found out the Rus∣sian Tracts, and passed on conquering al∣most to the utmost Orient, attended by a Squadron of three hundred Ships; nor <HI>Ed∣gard</HI> his Successor, who Ploughed the Bo∣som of the deep with four hundred Sail, asserting his Soveraignty on the Main, to the admiration of the Neighbour-Nations. Nor was <HI>Canute</HI> the Puissant Danish King, then Reigning in <HI>Brittain,</HI> less formida∣ble on his watery Empire, being proud to have annexed to his Style Lord of the Ocean. Nor <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, less Potent in Naval forces, as appears by the many Ships of War he set forth to give Battle to his Brother in Law <HI>Godwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> who kept the Seas with a great number of Ships that spoiled and wasted the Coasts of <HI>Brittain,</HI> as appears
<PB N="9" REF="151"/>
in the Reign of that King; tho indeed Heaven at that time prevented the Shedding of <HI>English</HI>-Blood, by sending just as they were about to ingage a thick Fogg to co∣ver the Face of the Deep, so that none could see a Ships length. By this means Seamen were brought up and fitted for Navigation, in such sort that in the Non∣age of the Norman-Conquest, as is be∣fore said, Traffick abroad began to Flourish; nor was Manufacture, that Sinew of a Na∣tion, less regarded, People being incou∣raged thereto, not only by the Princes themselves with large Indulgencies, but by such Wealthy Peers and others, as more sought the good of the Publick-Weal than their own Private interest, which ever re∣dounds in the end to their profit. For tho the Poor be never so industrious, yet wanting what to Trade with, their Indu∣stry will faint; but if they have imploy∣ment to improve themselves, Lands, and all things else will be improved, and ad∣vanced to a higher Estimate, and the growth of <HI>England</HI> be made of value equal, if not exceeding any <HI>European</HI> Commodity what∣soever: So that this spot of an Island may, nay is, rightly termed the Store-House of the World, who can subsist of her self, but without whose Commodities few Na∣tions
<PB N="10" REF="152"/>
can maintain their Grandure.</P>
<P>But to the purpose: The Kings after the Conquest intending to make this their constant Seat, and making little esteem of their Ancient Inheritance, the Dutchy of <HI>Normandy</HI> did not let to increase the Gran∣dure of this Kingdom, by granting large Pri∣viledges and immunities to those that were Industrious, but especially to the City of <HI>London,</HI> the chief residence of Royalty, named by many Kings, their Royal Cham∣ber: Nor was any thing thought too dear that might conduce to her Felicity, as ap∣pears by the Charter granted by King <HI>William</HI> the first, commonly called the Con∣queror, which was in these words.</P>
<P>William <HI>King, greeteth</HI> William <HI>Bishop, and</HI> Godfry Porters <HI>and all the Burgesses within</HI> London, French, <HI>and</HI> English, <HI>and I grant you, that I will that you maintain and injoy all your Laws, that you did in the days of King</HI> Edward (meaning the Confessor<HI>'s) and I will, that each Child be his Fathers Heir; and further, I will, that no man wrong you, and so God keep you.</HI></P>
<P>This free concession gave scope to Trade, being much augmented by succeeding Kings, so that Tradsemen growing numerous, they so prevailed upon the Benign Boun∣ty of the Reigning Princes, that they af∣ter
<PB N="11" REF="152"/>
long Fraternities obtained at several times to be incorporate in distinct Bodies, or Companies, to Implead, or be Implead∣ed as one man. The account of which as it happened in divers Kings Reigns, shall in the following Chapters be set down, be∣ginning at the first of the twelve, and so to proceed in order.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Original of the Companies of the City of <HI>London, viz.</HI> the Principal twelve, of the time of their being incorporated, and by what Kings and Queens: As likewise the names of all the other Companies, as at this day they stand confirmed.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THe <HI>Mercers</HI> (tho then Trading for the most part in Stuffs of the Na∣tive growth) were inabled to be a Com∣pany, and Permitted to Purchase twenty pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> Lands, in the seventeenth
<PB N="12" REF="153"/>
Year of King <HI>Richard</HI> the second's Reign, <HI>Anno Domini,</HI> 1393.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Grocers</HI> (tho at that time not brought to half the Perfection that now it is) called Pepperers, before were Incor∣porated, by the name, aforesaid, in the twentieth Year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1345.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Drapers</HI> for the most part Woollen, were Incorporated in the seventeenth of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1430. hav∣ing been a Fraternity from the time that King <HI>Edward</HI> the third so earnestly pro∣moted the Woollen Manufacture by admit∣ting the <HI>Flemins</HI> and other Nations, the free use of Manual Operation within his Dominions. That so his Subjects might learn the Craft, and not be beholden to o∣ther Nations, to work the growth of our own Country, and pay them extraordinary Rates, by the advance of Exportation and Importation; for what might be otherwise ordered to the Advantage and Glory of our own Nation by setting many thousands of Poor people on work, otherwise incapa∣ble of getting whereby to subsist.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Fishmongers</HI> (a Vocation no less advantagious to this Kingdom by their in∣couragement of the Fishing-Trade, of which hereafter I shall speak) were (in
<PB N="13" REF="153"/>
former times) two Companies <HI>viz. Stock-Fishmongers,</HI> and <HI>Salt-Fishmongers</HI>; but in the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight, <HI>Anno</HI> 1509. did bear their Arms as at present they do, and in the twenty eight Year of the King, <HI>Anno</HI> 1536, were United and incorporated in one Body with∣out distinction.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Goldsmiths</HI> (an Ancient Craft, so I may rightly term it, for formerly those that sold worked likewise their own Plate) were Incorporated and confirmed in the six∣teenth Year of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second's Reign.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Skinners</HI> had the Favour to be in∣corporated in the first Year of the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Anno</HI> 1327. and were made a Brotherhood in the eighteenth of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second's Reign.</P>
<P N="7">7. The <HI>Merchant-Taylors</HI> had their first pattent of Arms granted by Sr. <HI>Thomas Holne</HI> Clarencieux King at Arms, being then called <HI>Taylors,</HI> and <HI>Linnen Armourers, viz.</HI> in the twenty first of King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1480. and since Incorporated by <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, by the name of <HI>Merchant Taylors. viz.</HI> in the seventeenth of his Reign, <HI>Anno</HI> 1501.</P>
<P N="8">8. The <HI>Haberdashers,</HI> or <HI>Hurrers,</HI> for∣merly so called were Incorporated a Bro∣therhood
<PB N="14" REF="154"/>
of St. <HI>Catharine</HI> in the twenty sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1447. and by the name of <HI>Merchants Haberdashers,</HI> con∣firmed in the seventeenth Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Salters</HI> had their Arms, and as many suppose, were confirmed in the twen∣tieth Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth 1530. be∣ing a Company of good Esteem.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iron-Mongers</HI> had the Favour to be Incorporated in the third Year of King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1462. at which time they were greatly increased, and the Mines of our Nation much improved.</P>
<P N="11">11. The <HI>Vintners,</HI> formerly called <HI>Wine-Tunners</HI> were Incorporated in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, after he had Con∣quered all <HI>Normandy,</HI> and by that means ingrossed most of the French Vintage; But were not confirmed till the fifteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth.</P>
<P N="12">12. The <HI>Cloath-Workers</HI> had their Arms granted by <HI>Thomas Benolt,</HI> Clarenceux, in the twenty second Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, but the time of their Incorporation uncertain.</P>
<P>And thus in brief, have I declared the Original of the twelve Principal Compa∣nies, upon whom the greatest Stress of Trade depends, and by whose prudent Management, and Industry, <HI>Brittain</HI> Flou∣rishes,
<PB N="15" REF="154"/>
and at this day lifts up her Head above her Neighbour Nations.</P>
<P>Those that remain, are these (whose names I shall only recite, because they tend not much to our purpose, the <HI>Dyers, Brew∣ers, Leathersellers, Pewterers, Barbers, Chy∣rugeons, Armourers, White-Bakers, Wax-Chan∣dlers, Tallow-Chandlers, Cutlers, Girdlers, Butchers, Sadlers, Carpenters, Cordwainers, Painters, Curriers, Masons, Plumbers, In∣holders, Founders, Embroiderers, Poulterers, Cooks, Coopers, Bricklayers,</HI> and <HI>Tylers, Bow∣yers, Fletchers, Blacksmiths, Joyners, Plai∣sterers, Weavers, Fruterers, Scriveners, Bo∣tlemakers,</HI> and <HI>Horners, Stationers, Marblers, Wool-packers, Farriers, Paviers, Lorimors,</HI> or <HI>Lorinors, Brown-Bakers, Wood-mongers, Ʋpholsterers, Turners, Glaziors, Clarks, Wa∣termen, Apothecaries,</HI> and <HI>Silk-Throwst∣ers.</HI></P>
<P>All of these are Fraternities, and most of them Incorporated and have Charters of Priviledge, and large Immunities, tho in the days of our Forefathers, many of them were not known, not having brought their several Trades and Crafts to perfection, for many of which they were obliged to be beholden to Strangers; but the Natives of this Kingdom being▪ naturally Ripe-wited and of a toward Genius, soon
<PB N="16" REF="155"/>
became Arts-Masters, and out-did their Teachers; so that at this day, no Nati∣on under Heaven can exceed them (if the Materials be alike) in all respects.</P>
<P>But having given the Reader an account of the Respective Companies, whose in∣dustry at home, improve to a Miracle, what is brought to them from distant Lands, I shall proceed to give a Relation of the Respective Merchants, whose Tra∣ffick by Sea Inriches the Land, whilest the Land finds them with wherewithal to drive on their Commerce with all Nations, from whence any Valuable Merchandise is brought. But before I Lanch altogether into the Ocean, I think it would be necessary to relate the Incorporation of the Mer∣chant of the Staple, who once were the chiefest boast, and most profitable to this Nation: Nor indeed less profitable to o∣thers, as <HI>France, Flanders, Holland, Saxony,</HI> and many other Countries, the chief Mart being Established at <HI>Calis,</HI> a little before taken from the French, by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the profit of our English Wool then chiefly obliging the Flemings to side with us, against their Potent Neigh∣bour.</P>
<P>The Merchants of the Staple having been a long while a Fraternity were In∣corporated
<PB N="17" REF="155"/>
by the aforesaid King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and by him indowed with ma∣ny large Priviledges, tho at this day the Woollen Manufacture, being greatly increased, every one buyes his Commodity where he can find it best Cheap, so that there remaining no fixed Staple, these Merchants are not now of such Repute as formerly.</P>

fourth, from which time, they Traded with good Success, until the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who, for a further incou∣ragement to their Industry, not only confirmed them, but inlarged their Privi∣ledges.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Merchants of <HI>Russia</HI> or <HI>Muscovia,</HI> who having improved their Trade and Commerce in that Remote Kingdom, to the Inriching their Native Land, were In∣corporated by King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, greatly incouraged by Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and had their confirmation, with an Augmenta∣tion of their Priviledges, from the ever fa∣vourer of Navigation the Bounteous Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Merchants of <HI>Elbing,</HI> were In∣corporated by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and by her greatly incouraged; she, like a prudent Queen, and Patroness of her Country, well knowing, that by Traffick, not only her Revenues would be improved, but likewise her People be Inriched, and she rendered formidable to her aspiring Neigh∣bours, tho since upon some distast, they have left Trading in that place, and Trade at <HI>Hambourg,</HI> and other free Cities and Ports.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Turky-Merchants, or Merchants of the <HI>Levant,</HI> were likewise Incorporat∣ed
<PB N="19" REF="156"/>
by the same Queen, and were con∣firmed with a large addition, to their Priviledges by King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Merchants of <HI>Spain,</HI> or more properly, Spanish Merchants, or such of our Nation as Traded to <HI>Spain,</HI> were Incorpo∣rated by Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>East-India</HI> Merchants were In∣corporated by Queen <HI>Elizabeth, Anno</HI> 1600. from which time they have continually in∣proved their Trade in those remote parts of the World, being now one of the Wealthiest Corporations in <HI>Europe</HI>; their first rise was by imploying a Joynt-stock to build Ships (of which now they have Store) and so themselves in imitation of the <HI>Porteguese,</HI> and other industrious People, Traded to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and soon found the advantage by bringing home the same Commodities which we before were behold∣en to Strangers for at second Hand, and dear Rates.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign and in the beginning of King <HI>James</HI>'s, the <HI>Eastland, Greenland,</HI> and French Mer∣chants, were setled in companies and Trad∣ed with great Success, Building many Ships, and continually imploying some thousands of Persons in the Management of their Affairs, Exporting Commodities of our

<P N="8">8. There are likewise a Company of <HI>Virginia,</HI> or <HI>West-India</HI> Merchants, whose Industry has much improved our Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and advance the King's Reve∣nues in his Customs twenty thousand pound <HI>per Annum</HI>; which Trade into those parts has, and dayly will increase and turn to the Advantage of our Nation, and be a means of making further Discoveries in those vast Seas, in which lie hid past doubt many fair Islands, if not Continents as Rich as those which yield the <HI>Spaniard</HI> yearly so many Millions of Ducates in Gold Ore, and Bars of Silver. These and other Traders in remote parts make <HI>England</HI> Flourish, and stand the envy of her Neighbour Nations. There is likewise the <HI>Guinnie</HI> and <HI>Barbary</HI> Companies, both Rich in Shipping and Merchandise, having since their Incorpora∣tion gotten great Esteem, and much improv∣ed Navigation. And now, having given an account of the Constitution and settle∣ment of those in general that drive on the Trade, and Commerce both by Land and Sea, before I Lanch into the Ocean, to take a view of other Countries, or to describe their Trade and Traffick I shall ex∣pose to Publick view the Commodities of

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of <HI>England,</HI> and the Trade thereof in General and Particular, with a Survey of all the Measures, Weights, Currant Coynes, Inland Commerce, and what tends to Navigation. A De∣scription of the most material Counties, and of the Trade of <HI>Wales</HI> in gene∣ral.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ENgland,</HI> the Head of the Brittish Em∣pire, is in every Place so admirable abounding with plenty, that to describe
<PB N="22" REF="158"/>
her in every part of her Trade and Beau∣tiful Situation, would exact a large Vo∣lum. Therefore I shall only in brief expose to view what is most material as to my purpose: And first, I shall begin with <HI>Cornwell,</HI> as being the remotest of the Eng∣lish Counties, or Provinces; tho it be in it self, in many places, to appearance a Barren and Mountainous Country, yet does it pro∣duce Rich Mines of Tinn, which brought to perfection, is of great esteem in all Countries. With it there is also digged Gold and Silver, tho hardly worth refining, the Earth not having heat enough to bring it to perfection; there is found likewise a Stone Transparent, naturally formed in Angles and Points like a Diamond, which was it not so common, might merit high esteem. On that Coast, Herrings and Pilch∣ards are taken in great number, which not only sustain the Inhabitants, but being dryed prove good Merchandise in <HI>Spain, France, Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> The Sea Coast is adorned with many Towns, of which <HI>Falmouth</HI> is chief, being capable of recei∣ving many Vessels; nor is St. <HI>Ives</HI> of less note, yielding great store of Fish, not reckoned less yearly then four or five thou∣sand Hogsheads of Pilchards, and five hundred Barrels of Herrings, besides some
<PB N="23" REF="158"/>
Tuns of Congerdoust, &amp; great store of Ray-Fish, which imploys some hundreds of the Inhabitants, and inables them to provide plentifully for their Families, and reserve, as the old saying is, a Penny against a rainy day.</P>
<P>These Commodities, <HI>viz.</HI> Pilchards, are vended by the Hogshead, four of them making a Tun, as likewise by the thousand, they allowing twelve hundred small Tale to the thousand, and a Bar∣rel of Herrings, commonly thirty Gallons, is sold to the Merchants for eighteen Shil∣lings, twenty Shillings, or according as the fishing Season is propitious; Congerdoust is sold by the Kintale, <HI>viz.</HI> one hundred and twelve pound to the Kintale; Ray-fish are for the most part sold fresh, and that by the Dozen, at two Shillings four Pence, two Shillings six Pence, and some∣times three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Dozen, but their Dozens are extraordinary large, they al∣lowing sometimes sixty to the Dozen, but sometimes less, according to the Cu∣stom of the Place; their Weight is one hundred and twelve pound according to the Stander, their Yard and Ell equal to those of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Their Bushel for Grain and Salt import∣ed contains twenty eight Gallons Water
<PB N="24" REF="159"/>
Measure, and so proportionable the greater or the lesser Measures; but their Bushel us∣ed in Publick Markets for Corns is but twenty Gallons, their Gallon agreeing with the <HI>Winchester</HI> Gallon. The Bakers in those parts are but few, and the most thing they stand in need of is Salt, Ten thousand Bushel being yearly spent in Curing their Fish.</P>
<P>The manner of taking Pilchards and Herrings is with Nets, but the Ray-Fish with Hooks; the first being Fished for from the first of <HI>July</HI> till the first of <HI>Janu∣ary</HI>; the second, from <HI>Michalemass</HI> till <HI>Christ∣mass</HI>; and the third and last, only in the Prime of Summer; sixty Boats, and about four hundred men being imployed therein.</P>
<P><HI>Devonshire</HI> is no less Rich in Veins of Tin: adorned it is with many Towns and good Havens; as <HI>Exon, Dartmouth,</HI> and <HI>Pli∣mouth,</HI> the latter famous for producing the worthy Sr. <HI>Francis Drake.</HI> The Sea-Ports, as the former, most Subsist by Fishery.</P>
<P><HI>Dorsetshire</HI> abounds in Cattle, Fertile Pastures, and Linnen Manufacture; it's chief Towns being <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and <HI>Way∣mouth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Somersetshire</HI> is famous for the many Trading Places contained in it's Circuit,
<PB N="25" REF="159"/>
but especially in <HI>Bristol,</HI> the second City of <HI>England</HI> for Naval Commerce, as being stored with Merchants Trading into most parts of the known World; it abounds in Riches, and the County no less in Corn, Cattle, Wool, Woollen, Cloth Serges, and other valuable Commodities, which they Trade withal to other adjacent Coun∣ties.</P>
<P><HI>Darbyshire,</HI> the Head of which is the Town of <HI>Derby</HI> abounds in plenty of Corn, Leaden Mines, and other Minerals.</P>
<P><HI>Wiltshire</HI> is an Inland County, but the people Frugal and industrious, their chief Commodity is Woollen-Cloth, which is dispersed all over <HI>England,</HI> and brings them a good return, maintaining at least three thousand Persons in Carding, Spining, Weaving, Shearing, Dressing, and the like; the Head of this County is <HI>Salis∣bury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hampshire,</HI> famous for the great Trade of Hony therein, whose chief Cities are <HI>Southampton,</HI> and <HI>Winchester.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Barkshire,</HI> is famous for Cloth-working, abounding in Cattle, Rich Pastures, Artifi∣cers, Fruits of all sorts, and all things else necessary for the Subsistance of man.</P>
<P><HI>Surry,</HI> is no less abounding in all plenty than the former, and of greater Trade, by
<PB N="26" REF="160"/>
Reason of it's nearness to the City of <HI>London,</HI> that Mouth of the Nation, by Rea∣son of which it's Inhabitants have the better opportunity to vend the growth of that County.</P>
<P><HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> abound in Fruits, Corn, Wood, Wax, Hony, Cattle, and all other necessary Commodities, which by Reason they border on the Sea, they have opportu∣nity to dispose of at good rates.</P>
<P><HI>Glocestershire,</HI> is for the most part imployed in the Woollen Manufacture, <HI>Glocester</HI> being the Head City. In it are found those fa∣mous Hills of <HI>Cots-Wold</HI> on which nume∣rous Flocks of Sheep Feed, and affoard the best Wool in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oxford,</HI> is famous for her Rich Pastures, store of Cattle, and Corn, but above all for her University in her chief City of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Buckingham, Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Hertfordshires,</HI> are adorned with pleasant Buildings, rich Pastures, store of Corn, pleasant Rivers abounding with Fish, and Forrests of Stately Oaks, with which the Wall of the Nati∣on, <HI>viz.</HI> our Ships of War are made; nor is Venison in abundance wanting, nor any sort of Fowls common in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Middlesex,</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> the first famous for Buildings, and so long together con∣taining
<PB N="27" REF="160"/>
the Pallaces of our Kings Courts of Judicature, and above all incompassing the famous City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The second, for store of Cattle the many famous Ports, and the Commodity received by shipping, the Silver <HI>Thames</HI> Washing her Southern Shoar as far as the <HI>Hope,</HI> it abounding likewise in Corn, Cheese, Butter, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> next take place; the first famous for Butter, Cheese, Cloath, Cattle, Corn, Wool, and what not: The second for Deer, Conneys, Sheep, Daries, and store of Corn; but above all, for con∣taining the famous City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> which for Industry ought to be accounted the chief Boast of <HI>England,</HI> it being seated up∣on the River <HI>Yare,</HI> from whence <HI>Yarmouth</HI> takes it's name, and thirty Miles from the Sea by Water, tho not above sixteen by Land, has little forrain Trade, save on∣ly with <HI>Holland</HI>; the chief Trade being with the City of <HI>London,</HI> the chief Com∣modities being Stuffs, and Stockings, which are made for the most part in the Ci∣ty; it not being guessed, that less then one hundred thousand pounds-worth of Stuffs every Year are sent up to <HI>London</HI>; which Stuffs making and disposing of are under the Government of two Companies,
<PB N="28" REF="161"/>
the one called the Worstes Company, the o∣ther the <HI>Russia</HI> Company: Those Manufactures under the Government of the Worsted Com∣pany (and approved by the Wardens there∣of) have a Seal affixed to each, on the one side inscribed <HI>Norwich,</HI> on the other, such letters as stand for the Wardens Names, that are at the Sealing thereof. The other Seal has on one side these words, <HI>viz. Wor∣sted Reformed,</HI> and on the other in Figures containing the quantity of Yards the Piece contains. Those called the <HI>Russia</HI> Compa∣ny, the Manufacture, under whose Govern∣ment to be approved, by them is Sealed on the one side with these words▪ <HI>Fidelitas Artes alit.</HI></P>
<P>This Suff Trade is managed by Part∣ner-Ship between the <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Norwich</HI> Merchants, great quantities whereof have been, and are exported to furnish other Nations, especially <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>West-In∣dias.</HI> The Stockings here vended, are reckoned to amount to near sixty thousand pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> being most knit by Children incapable of other Labour; so that at eight Years of Age, many of them will earn four pence or six Pence a day▪ these latter are not under any Governour, but have their Materials found them by cer∣tain Citizens, as well of that City, as of
<PB N="29" REF="161"/>
<HI>London,</HI> which when made into Hose, are sent over Sea, most of them, to furnish the Neighbour Nations. The County like∣wise affoards Sheep, Conies, and Kine in abundance, as also, store of Corn, especi∣ally Barly; which being turned into Mault is sent up to <HI>London,</HI> as likewise into <HI>Scot∣land</HI>; all Corn is sold according to the Custom of the Country by the Score, which is twenty Cooms, every Coome containing four Bushels, and to every Score one Coom is allowed over-plus. Their Weights and Measures, both dry and wet, are consistent to the <HI>London</HI> Weights and Measures. In the like manner abound <HI>Cambridgshire, Northamptonshire, Huntington∣shire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Lincolnshire, noting∣gamshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Staf∣fordshire, Shropshire, Cheshire, Herefordshire, Yorkshire,</HI> the County of <HI>Richmond, Bishop∣rick</HI> of <HI>Durham, Lancashire, Westmoreland, Cumberland, Northumberland.</HI> And the strong Town and Territories of <HI>Barwick</HI> up∣on <HI>Tweed,</HI> all abounding in store of things necessary and convenient for the profit and pleasure of man.</P>
<P>In brief, <HI>England</HI> affoards more Merchan∣dise than any one Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> as <HI>Per∣petuanas</HI> Bays, Says, Serges, Cotton, Wool∣len, Cloath of all sorts, Kersies, Buffins,
<PB N="30" REF="162"/>
Mocados, Grogram, Sattins, Calimancates, Velvets, Plushes, Worsted, Fustains, Du∣rances, Tukes, Cony-Skins, Squiril-Skins, Fitches, Calf-Skins, Hides.</P>
<P>Also by Mines it produceth, first by Tin twelve hundred thousand pounds yearly, Lead eight hundred Foders yearly, Allum eight hundred Tuns yearly, Iron of all sorts eight hundred Furnaces daily, Sea Cole yearly 50000000. Chaldron yearly, Salt 300000. Ways yearly; as likewise all manner of Grain, as Oats, Wheat, Barly, Rye, Pease, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> likewise Linnen Cloth, Tallow, Leather, Glass, and Glasses of all sorts, <HI>Venice,</HI> Gold, and Silver, Train Oyl, Salmon, Pilchards, Herrings, Conger, Ha∣berdine, Hops, Wood, Cheese, Butter, Salt-Peter, Gunpowder, Honey, Wax, A∣labaster, Wools, Yarns, and the like, too many here to insert. Nor is <HI>Wales</HI> in most parts less furnished, it consisting of the Isle of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> the shires of <HI>Flint, Denbigh, Carnarvon, Merioneth, Montgomery, Car∣digan, Pembrook, Carmarden, Glamorgan, Radnor, Brecknock, Monmouth,</HI> abounding in Cattle, Pastures, divers useful Manufa∣ctures; nor are the industry of the Inha∣bitants wanting to improve the product of their Country to the best advantage, being a frugal sort of People, insomuch
<PB N="31" REF="162"/>
that whereever they Plant themselves they are thrifty, and increase the smallest Stock to considerable advantage.</P>
<P>Thus having taken a view of all <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Wales, viz.</HI> as to Traffick, and the native Commerce, <HI>London</HI> excepted: I shall now take a view of that great Me∣tropolis, having purposely reserved her for the last, she being as Crown to the rest of the Nation, and indeed the Beauty of the Universe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Traffick of London.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LOndon,</HI> the Mistriss of Cities, is placed upon the Banks of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> whose Silver Ebbs and Flows continually wash her Beautiful Walls, she being sup∣posed to be eight Miles in Circuit especi∣ally if the Liberties be included, and be∣fore the dreadful Conflagration in sixty six, was adorned with one hundred twenty two stately Churches, and now not guessed
<PB N="32" REF="163"/>
to contain less (within the Circuit of her Liberties and all) than 5 if not 600000. Souls, she being the Center of the Nation, and chief Receptacle of all Commodities, as well of the native growth, as from all Parts of the Earth, being the residence of the Merchants and Factors of all Trading Nations, abounding in the Riches of <HI>France, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Sweedland, Russia, Italy, Turky, Arabia, China, Persia, Egypt,</HI> both the <HI>Indias,</HI> and of all other Places where any Commerce is had, or from whence any Commodities are brought. For an instance of the greatness of her Trade and Traffick, I shall only insist upon the Levant Merchants, who yearly imploy four or five thousand Sailers, besides Porters, Weighers, Bargemen, Lightermen, Car∣men, Shipwrights, Cankers, and others which cannot amount to less then three thousand more, and are not adjudged to pay less than five thousand pound <HI>per Annum</HI> for Customs. The Goods they export is Cloth, Tin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which they import Silks, Cottons, Galls, Grograms, Spices, Drugs, Currans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The general Traders in this City are the Companies in the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Chapter, who Trade for ready money by Bills of Exchange, Verbal credit; and some Trades deal one with another by Exchange
<PB N="33" REF="163"/>
of Commodities, by mutual allowance at such prices as the Commodity bears. The general way of buying valuable Merchandise, as to Inland Trade, is by keeping Factors in the Country, or by holding Correspondence with those that make it their business to improve Manufacture or keep Fairs and Marts, there to buy up Commodities of all sorts, when advantage offers. As for Merchandise imported from other Coun∣tries, the Royal Exchange is the place most proper for Bargains, where every day, Sun∣day and other high days excepted, between the Hours of 11. and 1. Merchants of all Nations meet and discourse of their af∣fairs. The way of payment is, either to draw a Bill upon some Shop-Keeper, Mer∣chant of <HI>London,</HI> or other Wealthy Per∣son: Or upon some Correspondent beyond Sea; which Bill specifies payment upon sight, or the time in which it is to be Pay∣ed (which shall be more at large demon∣strated when I come to Treat about Bills of Exchange) or to take the Parties word for 3.6.9.12. Months, or a Bill under his Hand for performance, for which there is no certain rule, but as those who Trade can agree. There are likewise several Per∣sons imployed that are called Change-Broak∣ers, who are usually imployed to buy up Com∣modities
<PB N="34" REF="164"/>
for Shopkeepers, as they see ad∣vantage, also to make returns of money, <HI>viz.</HI> for so much money received in <HI>London</HI> or any adjacent City, Town, or Village, you shall have a Bill to receive to the va∣lue of it in the Currant Coyn of <HI>France, Spain, Holland,</HI> or any other Neighbouring Country, where your Occasions require it. There is likewise an Office that if any Per∣son delay, to pay a Bill he has accepted, and Trifle with him that is to receive the money, or refuse to accept of a Legal Bill, you may protest against the Party or Bill, which is entered, and may at any time be seen, that so men may be cautious in accepting Bills drawn upon any such Persons: If a Merchant fail in the World, it is no sooner known, but notice is given upon the <HI>Change.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A view of the Weights and Measures used in <HI>England,</HI> as they are Esta∣blished by Standard, and confirmed by the Laws of the Nation, and by Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>THe usual Weights that pass through∣out <HI>England,</HI> are Troy Weight, and Averdupois-Weights; the former consisting of twelve Ounces, each Ounce to consist of twenty Penny Weight, the Penny Weight to consist or twenty four Grains; and this Weight is commonly used in Weighing of Bread, Gold, Silver; all Physical matters, as Electuaries, Powders, and the like; eight pounds of this Weight being reckoned to Weigh a Gallon, and from thence Multi∣plyed to any greater Measure; four Gal∣lons making a Peck, four Pecks a Bushel, and <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Bushels a Quarter. Wet Mea∣sures are likewise derived from this Weight, both at Land and Sea, <HI>viz.</HI> twelve Troy Ounces is a Pint of Liquids, eight Pints a Gallon; which of either Wine, Beer,
<PB N="39" REF="166"/>
or Ale, is eight pounds Troy, according to the Standard of the Exchequer, and Acts of Parliament of the XI. and XII. of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the seventh. And by this Rule the Coop∣ers make their Casks for all vendible As∣size, <HI>vix.</HI> a Hogshead to contain sixty three Gallons, a Tearce eighty four, a Pipe one hundred twenty six, a Tun two hundred fifty two Gallons; as likewise all Casks made for packing up Fish, as a Salmon Butt to contain eighty four Gallons, the Barrel twenty four, a Herring Barrel thirty two, an Eele Barrel forty two, a Sope Barrel thirty two Gallons, the lesser Casks to be divided accordingly.</P>
<P>The other Weight, <HI>viz.</HI> Averdupois, wherewith is Weighed Butter, Cheese, Flesh, Wax, all manner of Grocery, and indeed most Commodities vended in <HI>England</HI>; it consists of sixteen Ounces to the pound, and is called Garbel, by Reason a Draught or Wast is allowed to every weighing: Seven pound of this Weight is accounted to weigh a Gallon of Wheat, and so Multi∣plyed to fifty six pound the Bushel; seven pound Averdupois, is one hundred and two Ounces of Troy; from whence it is accounted that a Bushel of Wheat must weigh one hundred and twelve pound, and a quarter four hundred forty eight pounds
<PB N="40" REF="167"/>
Averdupois, and so consequently fourteen pound Averdupois is sixteen pound eleven Ounces Troy; and as one penny Sterling is the twentieth part of an Ounce Troy, so seven pound twelve Shillings Sterling is eighty four Ounces, a half and two penny Weight of Troy, and six pound eight Shil∣lings Sterling, is eighty two pound ¾ Ounce, and one penny Weight; and from these two are the Weights of Houshold, Wheat∣en and White Bread Calculated.</P>
<P>The Weigh of Cheese is by Averdupois, and runs thus. The Weigh of Cheese one hundred and twelve pound Averdupois, and the two hundred containing two hundred twenty four pounds, consists of thirty four Cloves, every Clove being seven pound. The Weigh of Suffolk Cheese is two hun∣dred fifty six, and the Weigh of <HI>Essex</HI> Cheese three hundred thirty six pound A∣verdupois.</P>
<P>A Sack of Wool was accounted three hundred fifty four pound Averdupois: two Weighs of Wool make a Sack, and two Sacks a Last.</P>
<P>The last of Herrings is ten thousand, every one thousand to contain ten hundred, and every hundred sixscore, that is, before they are Barrell'd. Lead is sold by the Fod∣der, containing nineteen hundred and ½ at
<PB N="41" REF="167"/>
one hundred and twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> Averdu∣pois. This Weight likewise of sixteen Ounces to the pound is made three several Quintars for Weighing several sorts of Merchandise; the first is of fivescore pound just to the hundred, and called one hun∣dred Sutle, whereby fine Commodities as Spices, Drugs, and the like are sold, which are accounted by the pound, and to which over and above is allowed by the Seller four pound, upon one hundred and four pound taken from the overplus, derived from the Weights of <HI>Antwerp</HI> for Spices, and called by the name of <HI>Tret.</HI> The second of the Quintars is one hundred and twelve, <HI>viz,</HI> fivescore and twelve to the hundred, by which all Gross Commodities are weighed.</P>
<P>The third is sixscore to the hundred, by which Tinn is weighed to his Majesties Farmers, and some other few Commodi∣ties; and is called by the name of the <HI>Stan∣nery</HI> hundred. From this Averdupois Weight, by division the Weight called the Stone, which is twofold, the long, and the short; the long is accounted four pounds Averdupois, and the short eight, but in this there is no certainty, for it differs accord∣ing to the Customs of Counties and Markets. There is an other thing in use called a <HI>Tod,</HI> some places seven pound,
<PB N="42" REF="168"/>
others eight, and some again ten, being altogether variable. They have likewise a Clove of twenty pound, twenty eight pound, thirty two pound, and the like. There are likewise in most Markets for weigh∣ing of Flesh Stillyards used, but without the Approbation of the Buyers; they being unin∣telligible to many, and oftentimes false; first invented for the Weighing Hay, and Straw, for which uses indeed they are only proper.</P>
<P>Averdupois consists of sixteen Ounces, every Ounce consisting of eight Drams, and every Dram of sixty Grains; so that by it the Raw-Silk of <HI>Persia,</HI> and <HI>Turky,</HI> are sold, but then twenty four Ounces are allowed to the pound, or a pound and an half, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having distinguished these Weights which are of such use in this Nation, it is not amiss that I shew you what accord the one hundred and twelve pound Suttle has with other Nations, and Places of Traffick, as for the Equality of Weight tho they differ in number.</P>
<P>In <HI>Europe,</HI> it agrees with the Weights of <HI>Mersella,</HI> the <HI>Venetia Sotile,</HI> the <HI>Ve∣netia Gross, Sicilia, Lisbon, Florence, Anvers, Lions, Sevil, Dantzick, Bruges.</HI></P>

<P>This Kingdom abounds in Navigable Ri∣vers, store of Fish, Cattle, and Hides; which are Transported into <HI>Spain, France,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>; Salmon are caught in such a∣bundance in <HI>July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> that many Servants in the places of that Fishery, Covenant with their Master upon their be∣ing hired, that they will not feed upon

<P>THe Ocean Islands are scattered in the British Sea like so many Pearls to a∣dorn the Imperial Diadem, and are first, the <HI>Orcades,</HI> or Isles of <HI>Orkney,</HI> thirty two in number. The chief of which is <HI>Pomonia,</HI> which abounds in Mines of Tinn and Lead:

The next <HI>Hethy</HI>; and the other (there be∣ing only three of them of note) <HI>Shethland</HI> bearing Fruit-Trees of strange kinds. Es∣pecially those whose Blossoms dropping into the Warter become Flying Birds.</P>
<P>The next are the Islands of the <HI>Hebrides,</HI> in number forty four; the chief whereof is <HI>Illa,</HI> abounding with store of Venison. And <HI>Jona,</HI> famous for the Sepulchers of the Scottish Kings; as likewise <HI>Mulla,</HI> where the <HI>Redshanks</HI> inhabit, once so fearful to <HI>England</HI>; the rest are of little note.</P>
<P>The Islands called the <HI>Sorlings</HI> are one hundred forty five: The Principal are <HI>Ar∣math, Agnes, Samson,</HI> and <HI>Scilly,</HI> after which name all the rest are called. The Inhabi∣tants thereof Trade in Fishery, sow Corn, and addict themselves to Manufacture.</P>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Man,</HI> is a square Island, be∣ing ten Miles in Length, and as many in Breadth; the growth of it is Flax, Hemp, Oats, Barly, and Wheat, having store of Cattle and other Merchandise brought in thither by Shipping; the chief Towns are <HI>Ballacury, Russin,</HI> or <HI>Chasteltown.</HI></P>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> is accounted a Shire of <HI>Wales</HI>; and by some called the Mother of <HI>Wales,</HI> being twenty four Miles in Length, and seventeen Miles over; Fruitful

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A further Account of the Measures of <HI>England,</HI> with a true Proportion of the Weight of English Cloths.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, for the Breadth, Measure and Weight of English-Cloath, that chief of Staple-Commodities, <HI>Kent, York,</HI> and <HI>Redding</HI> Cloaths are six quarters and a half broad, and ought to weigh eighty six pounds; the Cloath in the Peice are in length thirty, and thirty four Yards. <HI>Suffolk, Norfolk,</HI> and <HI>Essex</HI> Cloaths of seven quarters wide, are eighty pounds Weight, twenty nine and thirty two Yards in Length. <HI>Worcester, Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Hereford</HI> Cloaths of six quar∣ters and a half, are in Weight seventy eight pound, and in Measure thirty, &amp; thirty three Yards. <HI>Glocester, Oxon,</HI> and <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and <HI>Summersetshire</HI> Cloaths, of seven quarters wide weigh seventy six pounds, and in length twenty nine, and thirty two Yards. <HI>Suffolk</HI> Sorting Cloaths of six quarters and a half wide, ought to weigh sixty four pound, and to be in length twenty four and
<PB N="54" REF="174"/>
twenty six Yards. All sorts of Cloaths that are six quarters and a half wide, ought to weigh sixty pound, and be twenty four and twenty six Yards in length; broad and narrow <HI>Yorkshire</HI> of four quarters wide, weigh thirty pound, and in length are twenty four, and twenty five Yards. Broad-Cloath of <HI>Taunton, Dunstable,</HI> and <HI>Bridg-Water</HI> of seven quarters, weigh thirty pound the Cloath, and in Measure are twelve, and thirteen Yards. <HI>Devonshire</HI> Kersies, and Dossens of four quarters, weigh thirteen pounds, in Mea∣sure twelve, and thirteen Yards. Chequer Kersies, Grays, Striped and Plain of four quar∣ters are in Weight twenty four pound, in Mea∣sure seventeen, and eighteen Yards. Ordinary Penistons or Forrests of three quarters and a half, in Weight twenty eight pound, in Measure twelve and thirteen Yards. Sort∣ing Peniston of six quarters and a half are pounds thirty five, Yards thirteen and fourteen. Washers of <HI>Lancashire</HI> and others the Cloaths are seventeen pounds in Weight, in Measure seventeen and eighteen Yards. This Custom of assizing Cloaths at a cer∣tain Weight was first imposed for the pre∣venting defrauds in making slight sleasy, or imperfect Cloaths, and if any of the aforesaid Cloaths prove otherwise then is specifyed,
<PB N="55" REF="174"/>
the maker, or seller, ought to allow accord∣ing to the want, either in Width, Length, or Weight, and for so refusing, may be sued for a defraud.</P>
<P>To bring this to perfection the Weight of Wool is thus, the Sack of Wool doth contain three hundred sixty four pounds, the Tod twenty eight pound, thirteen Tods being accounted to a Sack; every Tod being four Nales, and every Nail, seven pound: The Sack of Wool is imputed to finish four Standard Cloaths, of twenty four Yards each in length, &amp; six Yards &amp; half quar¦ter wide, of sixty pound Weight, commonly called Sorting Cloaths. In the Weight it is to be noted whether the Cloaths are thick Mill'd, well scoured, and throughly dryed, that the same be Measured by the Yard, and that an Inch be allowed to every Yard: And thus much for Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>And now I am entering on Ship-Board, to view the World, and to pass the unfa∣thomed Paths of the Deep. It will not be amiss to give a more full tho brief account of the Measures whereby such things are Measured as are sent on Board for the Sub∣sistance of those that go down into the Deep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as thus, the English Measures for all Grain according to the Statues in that case made and provided are the Pint, Quart,
<PB N="56" REF="175"/>
Pottle, Gallon. A Gallon being eight Pints, four Quarts, two Potles; the Peck two Gallons, the half Bushel, two Pecks, the Bu∣shel, two half Bushels, the Strike two Bushel, the Cornock two Strikes, the Quarter, two Cornocks. The Weigh either of Corn or Salt is forty six Bushels; and the Last is eighty Bushels. Note in Salt Water Measure is allowed, <HI>viz.</HI> five Pecks to the Bushel. Liquid Measures thus, the Ale Firkin to contain eight Gallons, Kil∣derkin sixteen, and the Barrel thirty two. A Beer Firkin ought to contain nine Gal∣lons, the Firkin eighteen, and the Barrel thirty six; the Kilderkin of Wine ought to be eighteen Gallons, the Barrel thirty one, the Hogs-Head sixty three, the Tertian eighty four, the Butt, or Pipe one hundred twenty six, the Tun two hundred fifty two. A Runlet of Oyl ought to be eight Gallons and a half, a Hogs-Head sixty three, a Pipe one hundred twenty six, and the Tun one hundred fifty two; tho as to Oyl in the Measure thereof, the Custom of <HI>London</HI> differs from the Statute, allowing but seven pound to each Gallon, and by that means the Tun is reduced to one hundred thirty six, and so at this day 'tis sold; and thus far having proceeded to give those that are desirous to Trade, or Traffick,

<P>This Immensity is for the most part possessed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and divided in∣to two parts, <HI>viz.

<P>The Commodities of <HI>Mexico</HI> (now cal∣led <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> the Residence of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Viceroy, and Arch-Bishop) are Gold, Silver, Sugar, Tobacco, Ginger, Tallow, Hides, and Spices; and above all, in that Province grows a Tree, called both by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and Natives, a Mettle Tree, the Leaves of which make Confections, Pa∣per, Mats, Flax, Mantles, Shoes, Girdles,

having the Bay of <HI>Roanoake,</HI> and Cape <HI>Florida</HI> to the Southward, and <HI>Mary-land</HI> to the Northward. The main entrance out of <HI>Virginia</HI> into the Sea, is about 10 Leagues; the Country is full of Navigable Rivers, stored with Fish, and some of them abounding with Oysters, Crabs, and Sturgeon, many of the Rivers being 7, 8, 9, or 10 Miles over, running 140 and 150 Miles up in the Country, so that Ships Anchor with great Security, no Trade be∣ing permitted but with <HI>England.</HI> So that as soon as any Vessel arrives, the Master, or Captain, resorts to the Governour, to give him an account from whence he came, his Residence being for the most part at <HI>Jame</HI>'s City lying 40 Miles up <HI>Jame</HI>'s Ri∣ver; and round about the English Colony, the <HI>Indians</HI> Inhabit, whose Treacheries prove too often fatal to our Country-men, as the several Massacrees they have made can te∣stifie. Their Courts of Judicature chiefly consist of 4 quarterly Courts, the Go∣vernour and his Council being Judges, to try and determine, as well in matters Criminal, as Suits between man and man, and every year once an Assembly meet in imitation of our Parliament, to settle weigh∣ty Affairs. Their Laws are the same with ours, as likewise what Monies they have
<PB N="62" REF="178"/>
are of English Coyn. The Soil is every∣where Fertile, and the Woods abound with Oaks of divers sorts, Black Wall-nuts, Chess-nuts, Ash, Pine, Day-Wood, Cedar, Saxafras, Mulbury, Small-nuts, Wild Grapes, and the like. The Weather is much like ours, only in the Summer continues a Month longer hotter, and are troubled with Flashes of Light'ning, dismal Claps of Thunder, and now and then a Hur∣ricane. The days are about an Hour and an half shorter in Summer, and so much longer in Winter. All sorts of English Fruits and Cattle thrive there, and their chief Com∣modities▪ amongst themselves are Horses, Oxen, Sheep, Hogs, Turkies, Geese, &amp; Ducks. Corn of which they have store, and their Woods abound with Hairs, Roacoons, Pos∣sums, Squirrils, Wild-Cats, Foxes, Bears, Wolves, Elks, and in remote Parts some Lyons are found.</P>
<P>Their Corn called <HI>Indian</HI> Corn or Maiz they buy and sell by the Barrel, which Bar∣rel contains 5 Bushels, <HI>Winchester</HI> Measure, and the <HI>Indians</HI> sell their Corn, Pease and o∣ther Commodities of the like nature amongst themselves by the Baskets, each Basket containing half a Bushel.</P>
<P>The chief Commodities they Trade with our Merchants for, except Tobacco, of

<P>The Commodities carryed from <HI>England</HI> thither, are Linnen, and Woollen-Cloath, Nailes, Iron wrought into Tools, Sope, Starch, Gunpowder, Shot, Wine, Strong-Water, Brandy, Sugar, Spice, and the like; and when any one comes over with Servants to Inhabit, as a Planter, he has 50 Acres of Land allotted him, to manure even where he will choose, unless in such Places as are before in Possession; and for that Parcel of Land, he pays 12 pence <HI>per Annum</HI> quit Rent.</P>
<P>The manner of planting, and bringing to perfection their Tobacco, accounted by them the Staple Commodity of the Colo∣ny is thus; in <HI>January</HI> they sow the Seed, which is smaller than Mustard-Seed, and when it comes up, they take up the Plants, and place them upon little Hills, which is usually done in <HI>May,</HI> 4 or 5000. Hills be∣ing

contained in one Acre, every Hill con∣taining a Plant, the which when it is about 2▪ Foot high, they Crop to give more Nourishment to the Leaves, which Leaves are a Foot or two Foot long, and some a Foot broad▪ and when they are at the big∣est they cut them up Stalk and all, and hang them up in Sheads to dry, which done they strip them from the Stalks, and so bind them up in Handfuls for pack∣ing in Casks, or make them up in Rolls.

As for Fowl, they Trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> as likewise for Muscat, Beaver, Otter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which they deliver them Strong-Waters, Shagged-Cloath, Beads, Looking-Glasses, and the like; and thither likewise are brought Provisions from St. <HI>Martins, Long Island, Road Island, Shelter Island</HI>; and other places, they all being little spots, standing in the Sea, and have their Trade chiefly consisting in Provision. The chief Roads for the safe Riding of Shipping are
<PB N="66" REF="180"/>
<HI>Boston, Charlestown, Salem,</HI> and <HI>Pascata∣qua.</HI></P>
<P>A Mint they have, in which they Coyn English money, as 12 pence, 6 pence, 3 pence, and smaller piece, both Silver and Tinn. The Reason of setting it up, was upon the spreading of many adultera∣ted Pieces of Eight amongst them, brought from <HI>Peru</HI>; but notwithstanding the Eng∣lish Coyn, <HI>Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Sevil</HI> Royals, go currant at a Crown apiece.</P>
<P>Their Accounts are kept after the <HI>Itali∣an</HI> Fashion, by such as understand the way, and those that do not keep them as in old <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Their Weights are <HI>Averdupois,</HI> and <HI>Troy</HI>; the former consisting of 16 Ounces the pound, and the latter of twelve; their hundred <HI>Averdupois</HI> is 112 pounds, and by that they weigh all their gross Com∣modities, using <HI>Troy</HI> only for Silk, Gold, and Silver. Their Measures are likewise consistent with ours.</P>
<P>Their chief Merchandise consists in Hogs, Oxen, Fish, Flower, Pease, Kell, or Rice, Biskets, Beaver, Muskat Skins, Otter, Pipe-Staves, Masts, and the like; and some Tobacco, for which they receive in exchange <HI>English</HI> Linnen, and Woollen-Cloath, Iron-Tools, Stockins, Shoes, Thred,
<PB N="67" REF="180"/>
Buttons, Ribons, Lead, Puter, Tinn, small Ordnance, Gunpowder, Shot, Strong Wa∣ters, Wines, Oyls, Fruit, Salt, and the like; not taking any Customs for ought imported, except Wines, and Strong Wa∣ters, and for that not above 30 or 40 Shil∣lings <HI>per</HI> Tun; Consolage they take none, their Factorage is from 5 to 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> for Sails and returns only, and that not fixed, but as the Trader, and the Factor can agree. Sugars they have likewise, which they sell in Casks, and have not many Ships belonging to the Plantation.</P>
<P>Their chief Fishing consists in dry Cod, and poor Jack, which every Spring and Fall, they take by Hooks, and sell by the Quintal, or hundred Weight, each for 28. or 30 Royals, sometimes more, tho some∣times they Barrel them up; their Fraight <HI>per</HI> Tun from thence to <HI>London,</HI> is 3 pound, 3 pound 10 Shillings, and sometimes 4 pound. They have likewise an Office of Assurance, now much in request, both by the Inhabitants, and such as Trade thither. And thus much for <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. A View of <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> and of the Customs and Trade thereof.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MAryland</HI> is upon the main Continent of <HI>America,</HI> being an English Colo∣ny, lying between 38 and 40 Degrees North Latitude, bounded on the North by <HI>Virginia,</HI> and on the South by <HI>New-England</HI>; the great Ocean on the East, and on the West the River <HI>Pattowmeck,</HI> and was first a Colony of English, <HI>Anno</HI> 1633. and for the better Increase of Trade, tolerate the Christian Religion of what Profession so∣ever; and is held by a Governour, or Proprietor, in Fee of the Crown of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> It abounds with fair Rivers, stored with Fish, and Commodious for the receipt of Shipping.</P>
<P>The usual way of Trading is Goods for Goods, and the chief of their Commodi∣ties is Tobacco; their Weights, and Mea∣sures are consonant with those of <HI>England,</HI> without any Tret or over allowance; some Beaver, Otter, and other Furs they have,
<PB N="69" REF="181"/>
which the English that Trade thither purchase, and the Inhabitants receive them for Tobacco, and Strong-Water of the <HI>In∣dians.</HI> Mulberry Trees are there in Abundance, and some Silk. Their Customs or Taxes are but seldom taken as to the Subjects of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The greatest abuse that Merchants re∣ceive, is the Packing of Tobacco; which loose Packed, or either too dry or wet put up, often deceives their Expecta∣tions; therefore the only way to discover such Frauds, is by weighing it. A full Hogs-Head, well Packed, will hold 400 Weight, and never less than 300.</P>
<P>For their Commodities, they receive Cloath-Hangings, Stuffs, all manner of I∣ron-Ware, Strong-Water, Wine, and the like; and what they Trade with the Na∣tive <HI>Indians</HI> for, they deliver them Coats, commonly called Match-Coats, made of coarse Shagged-Cloath, <HI>viz. Dutch</HI>-Duffields, or English Hogbays, either Red or Blew.</P>
<P>The new <HI>Netherlands,</HI> a place Situate in 41 Degrees North Latitude, upon <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, is Inhabited by a Colony of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have Incroached upon the English Trade with the Natives for Beavor, Otter, Elk-Skins, Bears-Skins, Dear-Skins, and the like; for which they
<PB N="70" REF="182"/>
deliver them Iron Instruments, and Shag∣ed Cloath, and sometimes Guns, Powder, and Rapier-Blades, the fatal Execution of which they have twice felt by two <HI>Massa∣crees,</HI> Committed upon them by the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> to the loss of half their Colony. Their chief Town is <HI>New-Amsterdam,</HI> indowed with many Priviledges, as the old the better to draw People thither.</P>
<P><HI>Corterialis, Nurembega,</HI> and <HI>Nova Fran∣cia,</HI> are accounted <HI>Mexican</HI> Provinces, and for the most part possessed by the <HI>French,</HI> and some few <HI>Portugals.</HI> Their Trade is small, consisting only of Skins, and Furs.</P>
<P><HI>Estotiland,</HI> or <HI>New-foundland,</HI> discover∣ed 1527 by the English, in Winter is so Extream cold, that it is not inhabited but by some few Natives, and all the advan∣tage (which indeed is considerable) that the English Reap thereby, is their Fishing Trade; the Fish in <HI>England</HI> being known by the Name of <HI>Newland</HI> Fish, and is taken in such abundance, that with them are furnished most parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The manner of the Fishing thus:</P>
<P>The Ships sometimes 40 Sail depart from our Coast, about the end of <HI>Februa∣ry,</HI> and about the middle of <HI>April</HI> arriv∣ing there, they unrigg their Ships, and go∣ing on Shoar Build Huts; and in Shallops,
<PB N="71" REF="182"/>
with Hooks and other Tackling, take sometimes 30 or 40 great Fish in an Hour, that is one Shallop, which they slit and dry upon Rocks, and Sandy-Banks; after which they Salt them, and in such manner con∣tinue till <HI>September</HI>; when loaden with their Fish they return and dispose of them in <HI>Spain, France</HI> and other Places to good advantage, selling them either by the hundred Weight, or by Tail; and many times they sell them before they have caught 'em; that is, Bargain for the deli∣very of them when taken; and of late there is an Art found of making Oyl commonly called <HI>New-Land</HI> Oyl.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. A View of the <HI>Peruanan</HI> Provinces, and of their Trade and Customs.</HEAD>
<P>THis South part of <HI>America,</HI> is divided from the North part, by the Streights of <HI>Darien,</HI> a Neck of Land of 10 Miles over; and consists of these Pro-Provinces,
<PB N="72" REF="183" MS="y"/>
<HI>viz. Castella-Aurea, Guinnia, Peru, Brasilia</HI> and <HI>Chile.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Castella Aurea,</HI> takes its Name from the abundance of Gold that is found therein, and was first discovered by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>: The chief Cities are <HI>Portabel,</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> at which two Places the <HI>Viceroy</HI> makes his Residence as he sees fit, and at the Latter of which the <HI>Spanish</HI> Plate-fleet for the most part is Loaded. It abounds with standing Pools and deep Waters, and the chief Com∣modities are Spices, Drugs, Gold Ore, and Silver. About it are several small Islands, of which the chiefest are, St. <HI>Antonio,</HI> and St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> situate against <HI>Cape Verd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Guinnia</HI> is situated under the Equinoctial Line, being fruitful in all parts, abound∣ing with rate Fruits, and so Incompassed and branched with great Rivers, that in Winter time many of the Inhabitants dwell in Trees for fear of Inundations, often cau∣sed by the overflowing of the Ri∣vers. Of this Countrey our famous Sir <HI>Walter Reighley</HI> made the first effectual Sur∣vey, and gave Name to the great River <HI>Arinoque</HI> calling it <HI>Ralinia,</HI> a River naviga∣ble for 1000 miles, and for Shallops and Wherries 2000. The chief City of this Pro∣vince is <HI>Manoa,</HI> otherwise called the Gold∣en City, of the abundance of Gold that is
<PB N="73" REF="183" MS="y"/>
found therein, most of the Trade consist∣ing of Gold-Ore.</P>
<P><HI>Peru</HI> is for Gold, the richest Province of <HI>America</HI>: The Mines being more plentiful then Mines of Lead and Iron in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and the Riches thereof may be Con∣jectured by this: When <HI>Piscario</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain subdued it, and took the King Pri∣soner, he proposed his Ransom, and deli∣vered to the treacherous <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon so∣lemn Promise for his Life and Liberty, as much refined Gold and Silver as amounted to ten Millions, but perfidious as he was, when he had Possession of the Treasure not∣withstanding his Oath, he slew him. The chief City is St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; the Soyl brings forth all man∣ner of Fruits, as likewise store of To∣bacco; but one thing is more admirable, on the Banks of the River <HI>Riolaplata</HI> grow Figtrees, one side of which bear Figs in Winter, and the other in Summer, and this River is 130. miles over, and 2000. in length; and in it are many Islands.</P>
<P><HI>Brasile</HI> is abounding with Cattel, Corn, and has in it some rich Mines of Gold and Silver; but especially Red-Wood by us, called <HI>Brasile</HI> Wood, the Trees of which are so large, that a dozen Families will make themselves Huts and dwell in the
<PB N="74" REF="184"/>
Branches of one Tree. It was first disco∣vered and peopled by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but now the <HI>Dutch</HI> have got strong footing in it, and derive a great Trade form thence, e∣specially in dying-Woods.</P>
<P>The manner of getting the Gold in these remote Parts of the World, are by Mining, or Washing and Fishing; As thus, they first search the ground, and finding it stockt with Ore, they dig into the Mountains, and still as they go under-prop, or Arch, so that a Mine sometimes is a Furlong under ground; their Earth they wash through Sieves, and the Mold separated, the Gold appears. Silver run in Veins or Sprigs, and therefore is got more easily. As for the Fishing for Gold, it is thus: They turn the Course of small Rivers or Brooks, at the bottom of the Golden Mountains; or with such things as take up Ballast in the Thames, drag up the Sand, and then sift it. The Gold which is found in the Rivers is washed from the Mountains, by the fierce Rains which in those parts are frequent.</P>
<P>As for the Islands in these and the <HI>Virgi∣nian</HI> Seas, they are many; as the Isles of <HI>So∣lomon,</HI> by some taken for the Land of <HI>O∣phir</HI>; the Isle of <HI>Margarita,</HI> in which is found many precious Stones, though void of any other Commodity; the Island of <HI>Tre∣nidado</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="184"/>
abounding in choice Tobacco; the Island of <HI>Baccaloes,</HI> discovered by <HI>Sebastian Cabot,</HI> whose Rivers abound in Fish, and the Land with Trees bearing Fruit; the Isle of <HI>Beriguen,</HI> of which the chief City is St. <HI>John</HI>'s, inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Island a∣bounds with Gold, <HI>viz.</HI> the North part of it, and the South part is as much famed for fertility; the Island of <HI>Jamiaca,</HI> now an <HI>English</HI> Colony taken from the <HI>Spaniards, Anno.</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> abounds with all manner of Plen∣ty, as Sheep, Oxen, Corn, Hens, Geese, Ducks, Fruit-Trees, Sugar, Tobacco and the like, and is governed by a Governour, under his Majesty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI>; the Weights, Measures, Monies, Laws and Re∣ligion, are the same with ours, and has of late been much increased by the Trading of <HI>English</HI> Merchants thither for Pepper, and other valuable Commodities.</P>
<P><HI>Cuba, Luca</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> abound in Gin∣ger, Cassia, Mastick, Almonds, Cinnamon, Sugar, Brass, Gold, and Corn, which are brought thence, and dispersed all over <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and in the latter, the Land is so fertile that it will produce Herbs, and Roots in sixteen days after setting or sowing, fit for use.</P>
<P><HI>Barmudos</HI> is a fruitful Island, abounding with Orange-Trees and other Fruits.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="185"/><HI>Barbados</HI> is an Island possessed by the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> containing in length 28. miles, and in breadth 18. and according to Compu∣tation consists of 126000. Acres of good Land, being naturally fortified with Rocks and Shelves: accommodated with several Bays and Harbours, for the safety of ship∣ping, the Principal of which is called <HI>Carlile Bay,</HI> and is Guarded by Forts and Plat∣forms, containing a large Town called St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, being a place of great Trade, before which 500. Ships may safely Ride. The next Town of Note, is <HI>Charles</HI> Town, situate on <HI>Oysten-bay,</HI> about two Leagues from the former, the Houses are built af∣ter the <HI>English</HI> fashion, of Timber, Lime and Brick, and round this Island lye other small Islands, <HI>Maevis, Monsirat, Antego,</HI> and St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> many of them inhabited by the <HI>English,</HI> others by the <HI>Dutch, French,</HI> and Native <HI>Indians</HI>; the Island of <HI>Barbados</HI> is divided into 11. Parishes, or petty Shires, out of which are chosen two Freemen Plan∣ters, to joyn with the Governour and his Council, which are 7, to discuss all impor∣tant Matters, and to make such Orders, as are necessary for the well regulating the Plant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, and the better to quell any In∣surrec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that may be made by the Slaves, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccounted at least 60000. a stand∣ing

The growth of the Island is Tobacco, Sugar, Indico, Cotton-Wool, Log-Wood, Lig∣num Vitae, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Season of exporting Sugars, and other Commodities of the Native growth, is from <HI>January</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> or <HI>October.</HI> Wines are imported in abundance, and are sold in publick as in <HI>England:</HI> So that there is not less then 2400. Tuns of all sorts spent Yearly, besides Spirits, and other Liquors. From this Island they transport to <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barmudos,</HI> a Liquor made of the Su∣gar Canes, &amp;c. called Rum, and for it re∣ceive
<PB N="78" REF="186" MS="y"/>
Pork, Fish, Flower, Bisket, Pipe Staves, and the like: The Apparel of the Planters, is the same with what is worn in <HI>England</HI>; as for Customs they have none, save only for Wines and other Liquors, which are Rated at a certain quantity of <HI>Muscavado</HI> Sugar, and further are obliged to pay half a pound of Powder, for every Tun upon Entery.</P>
<P>Factorage or Factory-Provision is 10. <HI>per cent.</HI> 5. <HI>per cent.</HI> for Sail, and 5. for re∣turn, as also 3. <HI>per cent.</HI> for Store-House Room; if any one will export Corn, or a∣ny manner of Provision being the growth of the Island, they must ask the Governours Con∣sent; 200. <HI>English</HI> Vessels and upward Trade hither Yearly; and the usual fraight to <HI>London</HI> is 4. and 5. <HI>per</HI> Tun, when Ships are Plenty, 3. pound, when scarce, 6. or 7. pound <HI>per</HI> Tun: There is no publick Assurance-Office, nor Exchange, unless sometimes in Sugar, for which Mony is received in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> And thus much for <HI>Barbados.</HI></P>
<P>The main Land about 100. Leagues from this Island, is called <HI>Guinia,</HI> lying South∣wardly, and containeth a Colony of <HI>English</HI> planted within the River of <HI>Serenam.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cracus</HI> lyeth 4. Leagues from the Sea∣side, and is very fruitful, having a Port, whose entrance is Guarded with two Forts

<P>The Piratical Trade is thus, 2 or more set out a Vessel of Prizage, or Free booty to Prey upon Merchants Ships, the which when they have taken and brought into the Port, the Owners divide the Spoil by Lot, mak∣ing the Partitions or Dividends as even as possible; as for the Captives they do the like, and if there happen to be an odd man, they either cast Lots for him, or sell him in the Market; and divide the Money, the manner of selling of them is to carry them into the Market, and place them in Stalls like Beasts, where the buyer Views and handles them; but especially their Hands, by which he is satisfyed, whether they have been Inured to Labour or not, as likewise in their Mouths, to see if they have good Teeth to bite Biskets as hard as deal Boards; and according to their Youth, Healthy Complexion and Ability of Body, they go off to the Buyer, he being ever after acknowledged for their Patron.

<P>THis Kingdom takes it's name from the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> City, <HI>viz.</HI> the City <HI>Fess,</HI> being the Goodliest City in <HI>Barbary</HI>; adorn∣ed with 700. Moschs or Temples, of which 50 are Beautifyed, with Pillars, Jasper, and Alabaster, the chief of which called Ca∣rucen, and Seated in the Heart of the Ci∣ty contains a Mile in compass, consisting of 190 Arches, and is born up by 2500 Mar∣ble Pillars, hung all about with Silver Lamps, and hath 31 Gates, and all things else porportionable, and the City computed to contain 8600 Families.</P>
<P>The Commodities in General are Dates, Almonds, Figs, Rasins, Hony, Olives, Wax,
<PB N="89" REF="191"/>
Gold, Hides, Furs, and a sort of Cordi∣vant Skins, Cotton, and Wool very fine, which is dispersed into <HI>Spain, Italy, France,</HI> and <HI>England</HI>; and of late the Inhabitants have found out the Art of making Cloath.</P>
<P>The Principal Money of this Kingdom, is the <HI>Xerif,</HI> or Gold Ducate, and account∣ed worth 10 Shillings Sterling; and is di∣vided into 8 equal parts.</P>
<P>The Weights are two, one used for weighing Gross Commodities, called the Rotolos, 64 of which are computed to Ballance our 100 <HI>Averdupois,</HI> and 100 Rot∣tolos go to the Cantar. The other is the <HI>Mittigal</HI> used in weighing Gold, Pearl, Sil∣ver, Musk, and the like; and agrees with those of <HI>Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Argier.</HI></P>
<P>The long Measure is the Cavado, of which 12 are Accounted to a Cane, and 181 or 182 Cavados to make 100 Yards English.</P>
<P>The Customs are 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> to all Strangers, but to the Natives 2 <HI>per cent.</HI> and for what soever they hand, they must pay, whether sold or not, which makes Mer∣chants sell their Wares on Shipboard, for the most part where Customs are Payed only for what is sold.

<P>THis Kingdom as the former takes it's Name from the chief City and Cen∣ter of it's Trade, and is very Beautiful; tho Inferious to <HI>Fess</HI>; in it is found a Burse, and Exchange, formerly much frequented by Merchants, but now for the most part taken up by Artizans.

The chief Trade is among them∣selves, for Dates, Hides, Furs, and Fruits of all sorts; Cattle they have, but have not the Art of improving them, their Coyns are few, but those they have are of Brass and Silver; their Weights and Measures for the most part Equallizing those of <HI>Fess,</HI> and <HI>Morocco</HI>; tho they are little in use, few Merchants Trading with them.</P>
<P><HI>Lybia</HI> is bounded on the East with <HI>Ni∣lus,</HI> on the West with the Atlantick Ocean, on the South with <HI>Negrita,</HI> and on the North with <HI>Numidia</HI>; and is Barren for the most part by Reason the heat is Excessive; their Trade, Coyn, Weights, and Measures, are not worth mentioning; by Reason their Commerce is little, no Merchants caring to deal with the Natives, they being in a manner Savages.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A View of <HI>Negrita,</HI> or the Land of <HI>Negroes,</HI> with the Trade, Currant Coyn, Weights, Measures, and Cu∣stoms.</HEAD>
<P>THis Province is Inhabited with <HI>Negroes,</HI> or <HI>Blackamoors.</HI> Bounded on the West with the Atlantick Ocean, on the East with <HI>Ethiopia</HI> Superior, on the South with <HI>Manicongo,</HI> and on the North with <HI>Lybia,</HI> containing a large Tract of Land, and is fertilized by the overflowing of the River <HI>Niger,</HI> or <HI>Sanaga</HI>; and is under the Re∣gency of 3 Kings, who have of late made 3 Kingdoms of 5, as <HI>Tombutue, Berneo,</HI> and <HI>Gouga.</HI> Each having many famous Havens, Commodious for Shipping.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Tombutue,</HI> from whence that Kingdom has it's Name, is Situate beyond the River <HI>Niger</HI>; and is Traded to by the <HI>English, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>; and with∣in four Miles of it is the City <HI>Gouga,</HI> which is likewise a place of great Trade, but as for <HI>Berneo,</HI> the Inhabitants thereof are for
<PB N="94" REF="194"/>
the most part Breeders of Cattle, and Hunters of Wild-Beasts.</P>
<P>The Commodities of these Countries, are Corn, Sugar, Cattle, Rice, Fruits, Gold Sands, and Ingots; which they expose to Sail for Cloath, Callicoes, Copper, Basons, Iron∣work, Guns, Shot, Glass, Beads, and the like; but Principally Salt, of which Com∣modity that Country is deficient; but the chief <HI>Maritim</HI> parts are <HI>Guinny,</HI> and <HI>Benin,</HI> first discovered by the Portugals, and for the abundance of Gold the Country af∣foards called the Golden Coast; the Ru∣mour of which spreading wide in <HI>Europe,</HI> the English soon found it out, and after them the <HI>Dutch</HI>: and now the <HI>French</HI> have some Trade there. The manner of Trad∣ing thus: The Ships coming into the Road cast Anchor, and the Merchants or Factors going on Shoar, declare what Wares they have on Board, to the Persons called Tol∣kens, or Brokers, which live in little Huts along the Coast, and when the <HI>Moors</HI> come down with their Gold, they are in∣formed by them that such and such Com∣modities are to be had, upon which taking Boat together they come on Board, and laying by such things as they like, propose what Gold they will give for them, which if accepted the Bargain is made; and
<PB N="95" REF="194"/>
they return with their Goods on Shoar.</P>
<P>The Customs are various. Particular Officers, being set in every Port, to take an Account of what is bought and sold; and every one that comes to buy, tho he buy nothing, must pay a small Stipend for his Person; upon his returning from on Shipboard, and to prevent defraud, there is still a Son, Brother, or Kinsman of the Kings, to whom the Port belongeth, to see the Toll be duly taken; and he that buyes Commodities under the value of 2 Ounces of Gold, makes his price for Customs as he can, but he that buy's above which they call a Benda, pays to the Value of an An∣gel in Gold for every Benda.</P>
<P>As for Coyns they have none, the Trade among themselves being for Gold-Sands, or Ingot by Weight, the fineness of which they try with Artificial Needles, in number 24; in some Places they melt their Gold, and draw it into Wire, and so cut into small pieces, the better to di∣vide it as occasion requires, and in other places they have pieces of Iron, which goes Currant instead of Mony.</P>
<P>Their Weights consist of Copper, the greatest of which is a Benda, containing 2 Ounces Troy, a Benda offa, or half a Benda. The Asseva which is two Pesoes
<PB N="96" REF="195"/>
and a half, the Egebba, or 2 Pesos which is half an Ounce, and so lesser tell they come to Drams, and Scruples of Troy Weight, but their pound is found the ¾ part of an Ounce heavier than ours.</P>
<P>Their Measures for Cloath is a Jactam, accounted 12 Foot English, which they di∣vide into two parts; as for their Wool∣len Cloath, they cut it into long Slips, and make Girdles of it.</P>
<P>Formerly the Trade in those parts was very advantagious, but of late (one Na∣tions striving to outvye each other) have given them an insight into the true value of Gold, and of such Commodities as they receive for it.</P>
<P>The Sugar Trade which is considera∣ble, is ingrossed by the <HI>Portugals</HI> at a certain Annual rate, and no other Nation suffered to deal therein, the Sugar made there being Transported to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> is from thence dis∣percsd throughout <HI>Europe.</HI> And thus much for <HI>Negrita,</HI> and the <HI>Guinny</HI> Trade.</P>

<P>THe Superior <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Abasine,</HI> is a Plentiful Country Go∣verned by <HI>Prester John,</HI> and the Inhabi∣tants for the most part Christians; it abounds in Cattle, Fruits, and Minnerals, but be∣ing an Inland Province, yields little. Trade to Merchants.</P>
<P>The Inferior <HI>Ethiopia</HI> is bounded on the West with the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Ocean; on the East with the Red-Sea, and contains Pro∣vinces or divisions, <HI>Ajan, Zanbiar, Mono∣motapa, Caffaria,</HI> and <HI>Monicongo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ajan</HI> is chiefly Traded to by the Por∣tugals, and yields store of Cattle, Wax, Hony, Corn, Gold, Ivory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zanibra</HI> contains 15 Towns, from which 15 Petty Kingdoms take their Names, and was first discovered by the Portugals; a∣bounding in Ivory, and Gold, the chief Town being <HI>Mosambique,</HI> where they have

a Castle, and ingross the Trade for the most part.</P>
<P><HI>Monomotapa</HI> is almost invironed round with Water. And is stored with Gold Mines; and Elephants of which 5 or 6000 are yearly killed for their Teeth.</P>
<P><HI>Manicongo</HI> was discovered by the Portu∣gals <HI>Anno</HI> 1486. And for a long time yielded them 30000 Slaves yearly, which they carryed to <HI>Brasile</HI> to dig in their Sil∣ver Mines.</P>

<P>This River is in Length 3000 Miles, and when it over-flows not, it portenteth some fatal disaster to the King or King∣dom;
<PB N="99" REF="197"/>
and by this means the Land is Fer∣tilized, for as for Rain there is none. The chief Places of Traffick are <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI> a famous Sea-Port, founded by <HI>A∣lexander</HI> the great, and <HI>Cairo</HI> commonly cal∣led Grand-<HI>Cairo,</HI> and in these Center the Trade of the whole Country. Therefore o∣mitting Places of lesser note, I shall on∣ly take a View of these two Cities, and their Commerce, with such as Trade in those parts, and first of <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alexandria</HI> first founded by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, in Expedition to Conquer the World, is the chief Maritim City of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and from all parts of the Kingdom are thi∣ther brought Flax, Hemp, Hony, Wax, Rice, Balsoms, Dates, Drugs, and Spices; and the Country in general produceth a∣bundance of Palm Trees, besides hither are brought the Plenty of <HI>Arabia, India,</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI>; as Spices, Drugs, Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that the Custom-House is accountable yearly for great Summs of Gold.</P>
<P>The nature of the Palm Trees that grow in that Country is this, they always grow in Cupples twisted, or twined, <HI>viz.</HI> Male and Female, the Female Palm only bears Fruit, and that not without the Male, for if the Male Palm be cut away, the Fe∣male will not bear; the Fruit is Cods with
<PB N="100" REF="198"/>
Seed, and pleasant Juice, the Pith of these Trees is excellent in tast, and very nou∣rishing; of the Leaves, they make Fans, Mats, and Baskets; of the outward Husks of the Cod Cordage, and of the inward Brushes; the Fruit they bear is like a Fig which serves the Inhabitants for Meat green, and dryed for Bread.</P>
<P>The Weights used here are four sorts, first the Quintar of <HI>Zera,</HI> second the Quin∣tar of <HI>Forfor,</HI> third the Quintar of <HI>Zaidin,</HI> the fourth the Quintar of <HI>Mina</HI>; the first is found to be English 112 pounds, the second 93 pounds English, the third 134 pounds English, the fourth the 167 pounds English, Averdupois Weight.</P>
<P>The Measures are two-fold, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Pico Barbaresco,</HI> which is used for the Mea∣suring of Cloath, both Linnen, and Wool∣len, and is in Length 25 ⅞ English Inches; and the <HI>Pico Turchesco,</HI> with which is Mea∣sured Silks, fine Stuffs, Cloath of Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and is found to be 22 ¼ English Inch∣es; as for wet and dry Measures, they are of little use, the Customs being to sell by Weight for the most part.</P>

<P><HI>CAiro</HI> is a famous City, Situate in the vast Plain beneath the Mountains of <HI>Mucatun,</HI> and not above 2 Miles from the Bank of <HI>Nilus,</HI> adorned with many state∣ly Buildings, as Pallaces, Colledges, Tem∣ples, and the like; and has in it a large Burse, or Exchange of 3 Story high, the first of which consists of Ware-Houses, for Gross Goods; in the second, is laid up Musk, Amber, Silks, Spices, and the like; and in the third the Merchants who have Ware-Houses, there lodg with their Reti∣nues; which Merchants are of 6 sorts, first the Native <HI>Egyptians</HI>; secondly the <HI>Arabi∣ans,</HI> or <HI>Moors</HI>; thirdly the Merchants of <HI>Europe</HI> Christians; fourthly the <HI>Turks</HI>; fifthly the <HI>Jews,</HI> and sixthly the Christians of <HI>Affrica,</HI> as, <HI>Greeks, Armenians,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Lord of this City, and Country is the grand Signeour who governs by his <HI>Ba∣shaw</HI>

or Vice-King. The Commodities Traded for by the <HI>Europian</HI> Merchants, are Flax, Rice, Balsoms, Puls, Fruits, Cot∣tons, Sugars, Hemp, and the like; which according to the overflowing of <HI>Nilus</HI> the Soil yields in plenty, or Scarcity, so that when they have a plentiful Year; they make a Feast to <HI>Nilus,</HI> or the River God; as they Term him, and exceedingly Rejoyce thereto.</P>
<P>The yearly Revenue of this Kingdom, accrueing by Customs, and other ways a∣mount to 3 Millions of Sheraffes, each valued at 8 Shillings Sterling, one Million of which is sent to the grand Signeur, one for maintaining the forces of the Kingdom, and the other to enable the <HI>Bashaw</HI> to keep his Court.</P>
<P>The Customs are either payed in Species or compounded for at 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> only Money entred pays but one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> but outward all Commodities pay 11 <HI>per cent.</HI> which is accounted the <HI>Soldan</HI>'s Custom.</P>
<P>The Customs of <HI>Alexandria</HI> are farmed by the <HI>Jews</HI> at 20000 Medins <HI>per diem,</HI> which according to computation, amounts to 55000 pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>Their Weights and Measures, are the same with those of <HI>Alexandria.</HI>

<P>Their Accounts are variously kept, some in one sort of Coyn, and some in ano∣ther. The chief Trade driven here by the <HI>European</HI> Christians, is by the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI>; the English having of late declined it, as having the growth of the Country or the same Commodities, at cheaper Rates in <HI>India,</HI> and <HI>Aleppo.</HI> And thus much for the Continent of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>

The first abounds in Ginger, Cloves, and Silver Mines, and was discovered by the Portugals <HI>Anno</HI> 1506. The money in use amongst the Natives are Glass Beads of <HI>Cambaia,</HI> which passes currant amongst them; their Weights and Measures are few, and those uncertain.</P>
<P>The second lyeth in the Mouth of the Red Sea, 10 Degrees Northward from the <HI>Equator,</HI> and yieldeth Cattle and Corn, but the chief thing Traded for is <HI>Aloes,</HI> which are sold by the Quintar, which Averdupois English is 93 pound.</P>
<P>The third lies under the Equinoctial, in which is a Colony of Portugals; the chief Commodity it yieldeth is Sugar, of which so much is made, as ladeth yearly 50 Ves∣sels of good Burthen; their Weights and Measures being the same with those used at <HI>Lisbone,</HI> as indeed wherever the Portu∣gals Plant themselves they impose their own Weights and Measures on the Inhabitants.</P>

<P>The Weights in use, is the Quintar, which contains 100 Rotolos, or 24 Oaks, which are found to be 400 Drams. They have likewise the Lodoro, being 176 Drams, and the Pound Averdupois, has appeared to be 148 Drams, and the Quintar of 42 Oaks to be 119 pound English, tho some∣times but 117.</P>
<P>Their Measures are two, <HI>viz.</HI> one for Linnen, and the other for Woollen, to which as before in the Weights, I shall re∣fer the Reader to those of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> they being in effect the same.</P>

Merchants, unless upon Extraordinary oc∣casions; and altho there has been an Edict, Published by the Grand Signeour, that no Goods paying in one Port of his Domini∣ous, and brought into an other Port, shall pay any more duty, yet it is not observed, but the Merchants are obliged to compound with the Customers upon that occasion. But this Custom of 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> is only to the English, by virtue of their Treaty, for the <HI>French, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> pay 5 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The charges of the Port for Ships, before they can be cleared, are sometimes pay'd in Commodities, and sometimes in Money, as they can agree; and the most part are thus. To the Cadie 5 Pico of Venetian Cloath, and Cony Skins to leave it. To the Cadies Servant, 3 ½ Picos English Cloath, to the Cadies Caya, 3 Picos of what Cloath he shall chuse, to the Cadies Scrivan, a Chicquen in Gold. To the Cadies Page, 2 ½ Dollars, to the <HI>Mosier Bashaw,</HI> 1 ½ Picos of Cloath, to the Cadies <HI>Janizaries,</HI> a Chicquen in Gold; all of which is commonly accounted to be worth 68 or 69 Dollars. But to conclude, the Trade of this Port, is most in request for the abundance of Cotton; which grows in the adjacent parts, after this manner

<P>In <HI>Phaenicia,</HI> are Principally found the Ci∣ties of <HI>Acria,</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> where the chief Trade and Commerce is with the <HI>Vene∣tians,</HI>

<P>Their Weights are the Cantar of <HI>Acria</HI> which makes 603 pound English, and the Rottolo which is 4 pound 5 ½ Ounces Eng∣lish, and 650 Drams.

<P>And this is the chief Scale of Trade, for our English Levant Merchants; all other of his Majesties Subjects, being prohibit∣ed to Trade thither: and by what is vend∣ed there yearly, the Reader may Judge of the profits accruing thereby, <HI>viz.</HI> 6000 Cloath and upwards, of several sorts 600 Quintals of Tinn, and not less then 100000, Ryals of 8/8 in ready Money, besides Lin∣nen, Stuffs, Furs, and other things of English growth, for all which they have large re∣turns.</P>

<P><HI>Arabia</HI> is divided into 3 parts, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Mesopotamia</HI> is in subjection to the <HI>Otto∣man</HI> Empire, and has for its chief City <HI>Carumite,</HI> the Seat of the Turkish <HI>Bashaw,</HI> but is of little note as to Trade.</P>

<P><HI>HIspahan</HI> formerly called <HI>Hecatompolis,</HI> from it's 100 Gates, is one of the Principal Cities of the <HI>Persian</HI> Domini∣ons; Beautifyed with Red Marble-Walls, of prodigious height, stately Buildings, as Palaces, Seraglio's, and the like; adorn∣ed with Ivory, Ebony, Alabaster, and Car∣pets of Silk and Gold. The Inhabitants do all their business on Horseback, unless such as are Slaves; and the City abounds in the stores of <HI>India, Arabia, Turky, Rus∣sia,</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> which for the most part are brought thither upon Dromidaries; and again disposed of to such Merchants as Trade thither.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="214"/>The price of Carriage is thus, 100 Maunds of Wares from <HI>Sciras</HI> to <HI>Hispahan</HI> cost 70 Sehids, and from <HI>Hispahan</HI> to <HI>Casan</HI> 60 Sehids, from <HI>Hispahan</HI> to <HI>Ormus,</HI> by <HI>Sciras</HI> 120 Sehids; and lastly from <HI>Hispahan</HI> to <HI>Tauris</HI> 40 Sehids.</P>
<P>The Weights are the Dram, the Mit∣tigal, and the Maund, or Maundshaw, 100 of the first make 66 ⅔ of the Second, and of the second 1200 maketh the third: the Mea∣sures are the Cavedo, long and short, and are as in the foregoing Chapter; as also the Coyns currant here agree with those of <HI>Ormus.</HI> Silks are found here in abun∣dance, both wrought and Raw.

<P>The Commodities of the Country are Rice, Grain, Ruhbarb, Coral, Silk, Wool, Hemp, and the like; they have likewise Silver Mines, and some yielding Gold Ore, yet their Coyn for the most part is made of the inmost Bark of a Mulbery Tree cut round, stamped with the Princes Seal,

and upon pain of Death, none dare Coyn any other, or refuse to take it, tho in some places they have pieces of Coral, twigs of Gold, and Salt Loaves which go at certain rates in Exchange; but the mo∣ney is as aforesaid, and those Merchants are obliged to take it for their Richest Commodities, and put it away again for such as the Country affords; they have Spices, Gems, and Drugs; but not of natural growth, but are beholden to the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> for them; their Coun∣try by Reason of the long continuing cold, not being capable of producing them.</P>
<P>Their Weights are those used general∣ly throughout the Provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> the gross Cantar, and the small Cantar; the former of which is only used in weighing Gross Goods, and is accounted 268 pound English, the small Cantar is 103 pound English.</P>

But the Natives who are called the <HI>Gensurates,</HI> and <HI>Banians,</HI> are the Richest Merchants, and greatest Traders; as like∣wise of late grown so Politick, that they have an insight into-most Commodities.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="217"/>The Commodities this City and Coun∣try afford are Callico's of all sorts, Corn, Rice, Butter, Oyl, rich Carpets, fine Chests, Cupboards, Carved and Imbellished with Mother Pearl, Plates of Silver, Ivory, and the like; there are found in this Country many precious Stones of great va∣lue, as Rubies, Jacinths, Chrisolites, Amber, Jaspar, Spinals, Granads, and Agats, as likewise several Rich Drugs, as Opium, Camphora, Bangue, and Sandal-Wood; as also Sugars and Indico in abundance.

<P>The currant Coyns are <HI>Mahomodies</HI> tho very Scarce, and are each accounted 12 pence Sterling, the <HI>Casanna Ruppy</HI> Esteem∣ed worth 3 Shillings 3 pence Sterling, the <HI>Jaquire Ruppe,</HI> 5 of which make 6 <HI>Casanna Ruppies,</HI> the <HI>Saway Ruppy</HI> valued at 11 Shil∣lings 3 pence Sterling, the <HI>Honde Ruppy</HI> valued at 2 Shillings 3 pence.

<P>The Weights used throughout the <HI>Mo∣gul</HI>'s Dominions are 3, one proper for Silk, and the other for all other Merchandise, <HI>viz.</HI> the pice which in Silk is accounted 5 ½ Mittigals, a Mittigal being about 13 Troy penny Weights, and the Sear small and great, which vary much, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sear of <HI>Surrat</HI> is 18 Pices Weight of Copper-money, and accounted 13 ½ Ounces Aver∣dupois, the Sear of <HI>Agra</HI> called the Sear. <HI>Acoberg</HI> is 30 Pices and 22 Ounces Aver∣dupois.

<PB N="141" REF="218"/>
Java, Molucco,</HI> and <HI>China</HI>; a Port it has, Capacious for the Reception of Shipping, but those of great Burthen are obliged to Anchor at <HI>Bardes,</HI> some Miles short of <HI>Goa,</HI> by Reason of the Shallowness of the Wa∣ter, where are purposely Built Sore-Hous∣es, for the reception of such Merchandise as are brought thither, which are set to Sail in the chief Street every day, from 7 to nine in the Morning, in the nature of our Fairs in England; during which time a great concourse of Merchants and others buy up what Commodities they like best, or can agree for; and in this place all the Natives of one Craft live in distinct Streets, being injoyned under severe Penalties, not to Marry out of their own Trade, nor put their Children to any other Trade. Their Winter which consists only in terri∣ble Rains, begins about the last of <HI>April,</HI> and continues till <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>The Commodities of the growth of this Island, consist only in Palm-Trees and Co∣cus; but hither are brought Silk, Spices, Jewels, and all the Manufactures of <HI>India, Arabia, Persia, Armenia, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Weights used here, are the Quintal and Rove, the proper Weights of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and are used in weighing most <HI>European</HI> Com∣modities. They have likewise a Maund of 12
<PB N="142" REF="219"/>
pound <HI>Averdupois</HI>; another Weight they have proper to the Weighing of Pepper, which is here found in abundance and near∣ly corresponds with our neat hundred.</P>
<P>Their Measure for Grain, and the like, is the Medida of which 24 make a Maund, and 20 Maunds are 14 Bushels English. Their Measure of Length is consistent with those of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to which I refer the Rea∣der.</P>
<P>As for their Coyns, they are two sorts, good and bad, so that when Merchants Trade, they as well include in their Bar∣gain, what Coyn they shall receive or pay, as what Goods they buy or sell.</P>
<P>The common Money is the Pardus Xe∣raphin, worth 300 Res of Portugal, or 3 Testons, which are valued at 4 Shillings 6 pence Sterling, one Pardus is worth 4 good Tangas, and one good Tangas is worth 4 good Ventins or 5 Badoves, a Ventine good is worth 18 bad Basarucos or 15 good ones, 3 Basarucos good, are 2 Res of Por∣tugal. There are currant likewise the <HI>Per∣sina</HI> Larins of Silver worth 110 Basarucos, also the Pagode of Gold worth 10 Tangas, and is accounted 8 Shillings Sterling, the <HI>Ve∣netiander</HI> of Gold worth two Pardus Shera∣phin, the St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of Gold worth 8 Tangas, the Royal of 8/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> called Pardus d' Reales worth
<PB N="143" REF="219"/>
440 Res of Portugal; as for the Larins of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> they continue not at any setled price, but rise &amp; fall, as the trade increases or decreases.</P>
<P>All the money received in way of Trade, passes through the Hands of the Sheraffs; a kind of Officers, who for a small consi∣deration for telling each Summ, are bound to make it good, either in Tale or good∣ness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded, I shall now give the Reader a Relation of the Pearl-Fishery; a View of which may be both pleasant and profitable to the Reader, as thus.</P>
<P>When the time of this Fishery draweth near, which is about the middle of <HI>March</HI>; the Boats go out, and let down their Di∣vers to find where the Beds of Oysters lye, by Reason they continue not always in one place; which being found, the <HI>Gal∣lies</HI> Armed, that are appointed to defend the Fisher-men from Rovers, Anchor, or Cruse at a distance from the Shoar, and then the Fisher-men set up a kind of a Wooden Village to contain their necessaries, and to Lodg in till the time of Fishing be over, and then put out their Boats or Barks, in each of which is 10 men at least, who moor∣ing by their Anchors, fasten a great Stone, or Iron Weight to the end of a Rope, and
<PB N="144" REF="220"/>
then one of them Stripping, has his Ears and Nose stopped with Wool, dipped in Oyl, and sometimes a Sponge dipped in Oyl in his mouth, and a Basket fast'ned to his left Arm, or about his Neck; he gets astride upon the Stone or Weight, and with it Sinks to the Bottom, his Companions hold∣ing one end of the Rope, by which when he has filled his Basket, they draw him up, he giving them notice when to do so by pulling the Rope, and when he is come up, another is ready to go down; and so take it by turns till their Bark is full of Fish; which then they carry to Shoar and lay on heaps, every Boats heap by it self, and so continue diving, for the most part in 14 or 15 Fathom Water, till the middle of <HI>April,</HI> or sometimes till the latter end; by which time those they first took are opened by the heat of the Sun, which drys away the moisture; and then each Boats Crue and such others as they have to help them fall to searching for the Pearls, but find them not in every Shell, nor at all times of the same perfection; when the Pearls are gathered, there are certain Persons that View and sort them, dividing them into 4 distinctions, and accordingly set Prices on them, as they are in Largeness, Beauty and Goodness, which they discern by a small in∣strument full of holes.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="220"/>The divisions of Pearls are these: The first, second, third and fourth sort, <HI>viz.</HI> the round Pearl which they call the <HI>Aja,</HI> or <HI>Ʋnja</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the wrinkled Pearl cal∣led the <HI>Aja</HI> of <HI>Bengala,</HI> the third sort cal∣led the <HI>Aja</HI> of <HI>Canora,</HI> and the 4 or worst sort are called <HI>Aja Cambaia</HI>; and when they are thus divided, great is the striving amongst the Merchants, who shall make the best purchase; for note that none are allowed to Fish for them, but such as will pay tribute and acknowledgment for so do∣ing, and indeed few there are that are ex∣pert therein. And thus much for the Pearl Fishing. As for the manner of their Sail and the Prices they are sold for in <HI>India,</HI> I shall speak hereafter.</P>
<P>As for the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> it abounds with Pepper which is bought up by the Portugals, six months before it's Ripe, and when it comes to perfection, stored up till the Arrival of their Ships; and to this Coast are accounted these places, <HI>viz. Romes, O∣nor, Barsellor, Mongalor, Cananor, Calicut, Granganor, Cochin, Coulon,</HI> and <HI>Cape de Co∣mery.</HI></P>

Miles, and more, so swift that Boats drive with incredible speed without Sails or Oars; at the entrance of this River, is a place called the <HI>Butter,</HI> where Merchants Build Booths of Straw and Branches of Trees, against the com∣ing in of the Ships, and furnish them with all manner of Merchandise, by Reason the Ri∣ver will not admit of Ships of great Burthen so high as <HI>Satagan,</HI> the which sheds when the Ships depart, they set on fire and remove their Goods to <HI>Satagan</HI>; nor are the Commodities vended her a few, for no less then forty Ships of Divers Nati∣ons, find sufficient to Load them and some to spare.</P>

<P>In these parts the English-<HI>East-India</HI> Company has Factories, and greatly improve themselves thereby; the Portugals likewise in this Tract have 2 small Forts, but no considerable Trade, that Nation of late much declining in matters of Navigati∣on.</P>

<P><HI>PEgu</HI> is divided into two parts.

From <HI>Malacca</HI> Vessels Arrive laden with Pepper, Porcelan, Sanders, Camphora, and other Rich Commodities. There Arrives several Vessels likewise from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> with Pepper, and other Commodities, who for the most part Anchor in a Port called <HI>Cosmia,</HI> not far distant from the City; as for the Customs they are narrowly look∣ed into by Broakers, who are imployed for that purpose, and have two <HI>per cent.</HI> out of all Commodities, paying Custom for their own share, and are bound to sell the Merchants Goods for them, and to make good what debts they contract, or false money they take upon that occasion, and in their dealings they are very Just; as likewise they are bound to find Lodgings and Ware-Houses for Merchants; their con∣tracts are made in Publick, yet in such a method that none but the parties concern∣ed can tell what is done, for by putting

their Hands under a Carpet, and squesing such and such Joynts, they know each o∣thers meanings without speaking a word, which is registred by the Broaker, if they come to a conclusion, in Leaves of Trees, used there instead of Paper.</P>

In this Island of <HI>Summatra</HI> upon its first Discovery, the Islanders had a Barbarous Custom to eat man's Flesh; and hoard up their Sculls, which they passed from one to the other as currant Coyn, he being counted the best man that had most Sculls by him, but of late they have in imitation of the <HI>Europe∣ans,</HI> Coyned money both Gold and Silver, as the Mass worth about 12 pence Sterling, the Tale which is 16 Masses, and the Cat∣tee which is 8 Tales, or sometimes 7 ½ Tales is Accounted a Cattee, and these Coyns are currant throughout the King of <HI>Achin</HI>'s Dominions, who is the most Potent Prince in the Island.

<HEAD>CHAP. LIV. A Description of Gold and Silver, their Intrinsick Value: The means to find out their Fineness and Allays, after the best and most exact Me∣thod.</HEAD>
<P>THe Weight used in <HI>England</HI> for Sil∣ver and Gold, is the Troy pound con∣sisting of 12 Ounces, and each Ounce again divided into 150 Carots, and from thence
<PB N="175" REF="235"/>
into 480 Grains, each Ounce of Silver fine being according accounted worth 5 Shillings 2 pence of our money, and so more or less according to the addition or diminu∣tion of allay. The pound Troy of fine Gold is Accounted worth 36 pound, the Ounce 3 pound or if very fine something more, or again less as the Allay is, as thus: The Ounce of fine Gold is valued at 3 pound, 33 Kes fine at 2 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, 22 Kes fine at 2 pound 15 Shillings, 21 Kes 2 pound 12 Shillings 6 pence; the Ounce of 20 Kes fine is worth but 2 pound 10 Shillings, and so losing value 2 Shillings 6 pence <HI>per</HI> Ounce, as it wants a Carot in fineness in 24, or the Troy pound. Now to know the goodness or fineness of Gold and Silver upon the Touch-Stone, by way of Essay, is to procure Needles of Gold and Silver, and Copper Allay sutable to any sort of Gold and Silver in Allay, and to be of 4 sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> the first of fine Gold and Silver, the second of Gold and Copper, the third of Gold Silver and Copper, and the fourth of Sil∣ver and Copper only; the first for the try∣al of Gold, and the latter for Silver, and of these Mixtures make 24 Needles differing in fineness from each, as thus; The first must be all fine Gold without any Allay, <HI>viz.</HI> 24 Carots, the second 23 Carots of fine
<PB N="176" REF="236"/>
Gold and one of Silver, the third 22 Carots of Gold and 2 of Silver, and so one Carot worse till there remains but one Carot of fine Gold in Mixture, with 23 Carots of Silver. And by this Rule the Gold and Copper, and Silver and Copper must be Allayed; and each Needle marked of what fineness it is. And by this means you may know the fineness of any Ingot or Piece of Gold or Silver; as thus, touch the said In∣got or Piece of Gold or Silver upon your Touch-Stone, and by it the Needle you think is nearest it in fineness; and if that suit not with it, try another till it suits with it, which when wet, will appear, and so by the mark of your Needle, you may be assured of the fineness of the Silver or Gold so touched, which is a better, easi∣er, safer, and surer way then to try it by Fire. And thus much for Gold and Silver, as to their Tryal of fineness.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LV. A Treatise of Precious-Stones, how to know them and their true value, <HI>viz.</HI> Diamonds, Rubies, Saphyrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as also the goodness and worth of Pearles in General.</HEAD>
<P>THe Weight usual in <HI>India</HI> for Diamonds and Precious Stones, were brought thither by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> called the Mange∣ar or Fanan, which differs not much from the Carot, whereof 150 Carots make an Ounce Troy; and is divided into 64.33.16.8.4.2.1. ½ ¼ ⅛ 1/16 Parts. The Mangelue or Mangear is near or altogether 5 Grains Weight, or 2 Tars ⅔ Accounted the ⅔ of 1 Carot, so that 4 Grains and 4 Tars weigh a Fanan, the Fanan being somewhat above 2 of our Carots, for 11 ¼ Fanans are 1 Mittigal. and 6 Mittiglas and ½ make the Ounce Troy; this Fanan in many parts of <HI>India</HI> goes currant for a Coyn, being E∣qually valued with a Spanish Ryal; and thus having laid down the proportion of the Weights, I shall first begin with the Dimonds, the chief of Precious Stones,
<PB N="178" REF="237"/>
then to know a good and true Diamond take this rule. A good and right Diamond is fast and no ways porous, so that it will re∣sist the Fire, and after several hours con∣tinuance therein, come out bright as at first; and in choice of such a one▪ it must be nei∣ther Brown, Yellowish, Blewish, nor a Dullish-Black, but of a good Water-Chri∣staline; not wanting any corner when Po∣lished on a Mill, nor be too thick nor too thinn, but so as it may be set firm, and to good advantage in a Ring, or Collet without being upholden by Velvet, and such a Diamond weighing 1 Carot is worth 35 pounds Sterling or upwards.</P>
<P>Note when you have found out the true value of a perfect Diamond or Diamonds, this Rule is to be observed. Suppose a Dia∣mond weighing a Carot Weight be worth 40 Ducats more or less, then the 4th. part being ten Ducats is the price of a Diamond weighing half a Carot, so the Diamond weighing a Carot is worth but the 4th. part of the value of one weighing 2 Ca∣rots, <HI>viz.</HI> 40 Ducats, and that weighing 2 Carots worth 160 Ducats; and so if there be over Weight by Grains, you must di∣vide all into Grains, and then a Diamond weighing 3 Grains is worth but the 4th. part of that weighing 6. And this is a Ge∣neral
<PB N="179" REF="237"/>
Rule, not only for Diamonds but all manner of precious Stones, according to Equality in goodness, as for Example a thick Table Diamond of the goodness a∣foresaid weighing 1 Grain is worth 1 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, weighing 2 Grains is worth 7 pound 10 Shillings, weighing 3 Grains is worth 16 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, weighing 1 Carot is worth 30 pound, and so proportionably to 8 Carots, yet there are some Diamonds imperfect, and not of any Extraordinary value, which are called Brut Diamonds, Naifs, Rocks, and flat-Stones, which are bought and sold at uncertain rates.</P>
<P>The Ruby is found in <HI>Zeilam</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> and called commonly the Carbuncle, try∣ed in the Fire to know its perfection, the which if it abide and come out Burning like a Cole and of a high Colour, it is Ac∣counted perfect; a Stone of which perfecti∣on weighing but one Carot or ½, a Fanan is valued at 30 Fanans in <HI>Callicut,</HI> and in∣crease in value as the Dimonds according to their Weight; there is another sort on∣ly called a Ruby, found in a River in the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI>; but it will not indure the Fire, but looseth it's Colour▪ when put to the Tryal; there are likewise several sorts of Rubies as the Carbuncle, Ballas,
<PB N="180" REF="238"/>
Spinal, Garnat, and Rubas; but this Ruby of <HI>Pegu</HI> is accounted the next in value to the Carbuncle, and a Ruby square table-wise, perfect, and of high Colour of 16.18.20. or 24. Carots in Colour, weigh∣ing a Fanan is worth sometimes in the <HI>In∣dia</HI>'s, 100. Ducats, and in <HI>England</HI> weighing 11 ½ Carots, and of 20 Carots in Colour perfect and without Blemish, is worth 350 pound Sterling or rather more.</P>
<P>Saphyrs are found in <HI>Zeilam, Calucut, Ba∣singer, Canoner,</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> and those are accounted best that are of a pure Azure or Sky-Colour, and in that hardness excelleth all other Stones the Diamond excepted, and according to their Colour are held in Esti∣mation; as for example, Saphyr weigh∣ing one Carot is worth 2 Fanans, one weighing 2 Carots is worth 5 Fanans, one weighing 3 worth 10 Fanans, and one weighing 4 Carots worth 15 Fanans, and so Proportionably each Fanan being Ac∣counted 2 Carots; after this manner Tur∣quoise, Topaze, Berrils, Crysolites, Jacynths, Amathists, and other precious Stones are known and valued every one according to their goodness and Weight; as for Pearls, how they are taken, I have before set down, and now I shall as far as is necessary make a report of their true value
<PB N="181" REF="238"/>
according as they are in goodness.</P>
<P>The Rule to value Oriental Pearls, from a Grain in Weight to what bigness any will afford, is by the Colour, Round∣ness, Pear-Fashion, or Oval; and that is in all parts perfect, as to Water and Gloss, without Knobs, Specks, Yellowness or other imperfections, and a Pearl of this perfection weighing a Carot is worth a Ducat in <HI>India.</HI> But before I proceed fur∣ther, as to their value it will not be a∣miss to relate how they are sold, by those that have the disposing of them, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> sell them by Sieves of Latten full of holes in number 12, one bigger then the other as to their holes, and according to the largeness or smallness, the price is re∣gulated; for those of the 10, 11, and 12 Sieve are seldom capable to be holed, and therefore are called Seed-Pearls; most fit for Apothecaries, to be used by them in their Physical Preparations; but the others for the use of Ladies, and others to adorn themselves withal; and for the price of all large Pearls, they are valued as is said by Weight and fairness, as Diamonds and o∣ther precious Stones, tho seldom before they be holed for fear of their breaking in the holing; as thus, a Pearl of one Grain is worth 7 pence, of 2 Grains 2 Shillings
<PB N="182" REF="239"/>
6 pence, of 3 Grains 5 Shillings 7 pence, of 1 Carot 10 Shillings, and so in pro∣portion to those of greater Weight, as for Seed-Pearls, the smallest of which are Ac∣counted 4500. to the Ounce, and the larg∣est 400 or 450 to the Ounce, and com∣monly divided into 6 parts, the Prizes are these: The 6th. or smallest sort 4500 are commonly sold for 2 pound 4 Shillings the Ounce, the 5th. sort are sold for 1 pound 6 Shillings the Ounce, the 4th. sort at 10 Shillings the Ounce, the third sort at 18 Shillings the Ounce, the second at 1 pound 6 Shillings, and the first at 1 pound 15 Shillings. But note that the first is termed the sixth sort, and so Consequently the sixth the first; the Rag Pearls which are sold likewise by the Ounce, according to their bigness are divided into thirds, se∣conds, and firsts, an Ounce of which con∣taining 350 Pearls, is Accounted worth 1 pound 18 Shillings, an Ounce containing 250 Pearls is Accounted worth 3 pounds, an Ounce of 150 worth 4 pounds, and so according to their lesser quantity or num∣ber, in making the Ounce, all sorts of half round Pearls of pure Water, and Gloss are Accounted worth a round Pearl of half the Weight. And thus much for Gold, Silver, precious Stones, and Oriential
<PB N="283" REF="239"/>
Pearls; with which I shall return to <HI>Europe,</HI> as the common Receptacle of those rich Commodities, which were of little value to the <HI>Indians,</HI> before the <HI>European</HI> Navi∣gators set Prizes thereon, and by that means taught the Natives how to Esteem them; for in the first Discovery of the <HI>In∣dies</HI> by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> they bought them for Beads of Glass, and such like Trifles, but now they are not purchased; but at Extra∣ordinary rates.</P>

<P>And at <HI>Alicant</HI> the Merchants keep their Accounts in Livers, Solds, and Deniers, 12 Deniers making a Sold, and 20 Solds a Liver, which is Accounted worth 5 Shil∣lings Sterling, the Sold being Accounted 3 Pence, and the Denier a Farthing.</P>
<P>The Weights in use are the Cargo and Rove, 10 of the latter making the former,
<PB N="191" REF="243"/>
and of these Roves there are two sorts, one computed 18 Ounces, and the other 12 to each pound, and by that means tho one be reckoned 36 pound, and the other but 24, yet in Weight they are equal as to the number of Ounces; and by these are sold Pepper, Rice, Almonds, Cloves, Cin∣namond, and the like; by the Cargo is weighed all Gross Commodities, it con∣taining 280 pound English. There is sometimes used a Quintal of 96 pound A∣verdupois, and by it Drugs are weighed.</P>
<P>The Measure of Length is the Vare, which wants a ⅙ part of the English Yard. The Liquid Measure for Wine is the Can∣tar, which is about 3 Gallons English, and the dry Measure for Corn is called the Chaffise, and is near 3 Bushel English.</P>
<P>The Customs for the most part are rat∣ed at 11 Deniers <HI>per centum</HI> Livers, and is payable at 8 Deniers to the Duana and 3 Deniers to the Sisa, payed as well by the Buyer as Seller as often as Goods are bought, sold, or bartered; for so that the Buyer and Seller pay between them 9 <HI>per cent.</HI> And thus leaving <HI>Alicant,</HI> I return to take a View of <HI>Madrid,</HI> Accounted the Principal City of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<P><HI>MAdrid</HI> is Situate in the Provinces of <HI>Castill,</HI> and of late become famous, for being the place where for the most part the Spanish Court resides; and in it the Mo∣nies that are dispersed over <HI>Spain</HI> have their Original. This City abounds with all manner of Commodities, that either <HI>Spain, India, Barbary, Arabia, Persia, Egypt</HI> or other Countries affoard; as Spices, Gold, Silks, Drugs, Stuffs, Jewels, Drugs, and the like. The Native Commodities of this Province are Honey, Allum, Wine, Oyl, Fruits, Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Measures and Weights are those common throughout <HI>Spain,</HI> but by Reason all the Coyns of the Kingdom Center here, I think it not amiss to set down their Names and true values.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Ducat of <HI>Castil</HI> is worth 375 Maruedies.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Castiliano 485 Maruedies.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="193" REF="244"/>3. The Florin of <HI>Castile</HI> is worth 265 Maruedies or near 4 Shillings Ster∣ling.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Ducat Count or Quento of Marue∣dies is a Million.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Count or Quento of Maruedies is Ducats 2666 2/3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and at <HI>Dobra</HI> is accounted worth 2739 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>/73 Dobras, the which accord∣ing to computation amounts to 733 pound 6 Shillings 8 pence Sterling.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Ryal Single of <HI>Castile</HI> is worth 34 Maruedies or 6 pence Ster∣ling.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Quento of <HI>Mar</HI> is worth 3258 Ryals and 3 Maruedies.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Crown of <HI>Castile</HI> is worth 323 Maruedies.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Ducat of <HI>Spain</HI> is 5 Shillings 6 pence of our money, the Ryal is 6 pence and the Maruedie about the bigness of one of our Farthings.</P>
<P>In this City when they give money up∣on Exchange, they commonly agree to be repayed in Ducats of Gold, or to the same value in Gold or Silver, for the most part by Weight to prevent the taking base money, with which <HI>Spain</HI> abounds, so that should they not take this course, they would often lose 4 or 5 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>In this Province are yearly 4 Fairs or
<PB N="194" REF="245"/>
great Marts, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Medina Del Campo</HI> which lasts 50 days, at <HI>Medina de Riosecco</HI> which lasts 30 days, at <HI>Medina del Campo</HI> again which lasts 50 days, and lastly at <HI>Villa Lyon</HI> which lasts 20 days.</P>
<P>These Fairs, <HI>viz.</HI> the 3 first are Fairs of Exchange: And when they make pay∣ments they make them in Banco not say∣ing forth, and they are to remit in Ducats <HI>de Oro, in Oro Largo</HI> and forth of Banco, and when they agree forth of Banco, and for ready money there is got 1 <HI>per cent.</HI> and when they agree for Ducats of Gold or the worth of them, it is understood that the worth if the payment be not pay∣ed in Ducats, is to be payed in Maruedies at 375 to the Ducat.

<P><PB N="197" REF="246"/>The Measures of length used in this Ci∣ty are the Coueda, which is the third part of an English Yard, and the Ware which wants but a Nale of an English Ell; by the for∣mer they Measure Woollen Cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and by the latter Linnen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>FRance</HI> is a large and Fertile part of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> bounded on the North with the Brittish Ocean, on the West with the <HI>Aqui∣tanian</HI> Sea, on the South with the <HI>Medi∣terranian,</HI> and on the East with the <HI>Pirenae∣an</HI> Hills and River <HI>Rhine</HI>; and is divided in∣to several Provinces, the Trade of which I shall instance in these following Cities,
<PB N="199" REF="247"/>
<HI>viz. Burdeaux, Rouen, Paris, Lyons,</HI> and <HI>Marselia,</HI> of these in order.</P>
<P><HI>Burdeaux</HI> is Situate on the Banks of <HI>Ge∣ronde,</HI> being the Principal City of the Province of <HI>Aquitain</HI>; and is placed in a very Fruitful Soil, especially for Wines: The Principal Vineyards of <HI>France</HI> being accounted in its Neighbourhood; of the Grapes therein growing, are made Whitewines and Claret in abundance; and of late all Palled Wines and such as other∣wise are foul &amp; not Merchantable, they Lmi∣beck off into Brandies, which for the most part is vended in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> They have likewise several Vineyards yield∣ing Grapes that make Sweet-Wines, com∣monly called high Country Wines, the which lest it should hinder the Sail of the other, they prohibit to be sold in their City till Christmass day; when the high Country Merchants bring it in, and sell it to Strang∣ers there resident; and such is the Custom of the place, that that Vessel or Lighter that first sets her Head on Shoar, is accounted free from Impost or Custom, yet must in lieu thereof for that day give Wine on Free-cost, to such as come on Board to Drink it. To this City it is that our Eng∣lish Merchants Trade, and from whence they yearly bring 20000 Tuns of Whitewine,
<PB N="200" REF="248"/>
Claret Sweet, and Brandy Wines in times when no prohibition is layed, this City formerly for many Years having been English; there are found great quantities of Prunes of the Neighbouring growth, and some other Commodities, tho these are the chief, and to this place monies are remitted, for which mostly the Inhabitants Trade not as in other places ef Traffick, freely bartering Goods for Goods. Their Ac∣counts are kept for the most part in Li∣vers, Sold's, and Denies; as indeed through∣out the Kingdom. Their Weight is the pound, 100 of which are reckoned a Quin∣tar, or 110 English, 90 ¾ pound being 100 pound English. Their Measure of length is an Auln accounted 42 English Inches, their Wines are computed by Hogs-Heads and Tearces, <HI>viz.</HI> Claret and White∣wines, and their Brandy by Punchings of no certain Gauge.</P>

<P><HI>ROuen</HI> is the Principal City of <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI> being the Parliamentary Seat of that Province, and is Seated on the Banks of the River <HI>Sein</HI>; all its Territo∣ries being Fertile, and it abounding with rich Merchandise, as well of other Nati∣ons as the Growth of the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> and is visited by most of the Mer∣chants of all the Northern Kingdoms Trading in the Growth of <HI>France</HI>; the place affording of natural Growth and Native Manufactury, fine and coarse Linnens, Buck∣rams, Paper, Cards, Wine, Stuffs, Combs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which the Inhabitants or such <HI>French</HI> Merchants as send their Commodities thi∣ther to be vended, receive of the English Kersies of <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> Bays of <HI>Coxal,</HI> Cottons of <HI>Wales,</HI> Pepper, Gauls, Yarn, Tinn, Lead, Fish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but of late they have got a Custom to Trade for Sterling, many Commodities being allowed at no other Exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="249"/>Their Accounts are kept in Solds, Li∣vers, and Deniers. As for Weights here is principally found the Kings Beam called the Viconte, which exceeds our long hun∣dred, <HI>viz.</HI> 112 pound 14 <HI>per cent.</HI> so that it makes English, 126 pound, tho sometimes less. Their Measure of length is the Auln, accounted 46 Inches or somewhat more, by which they Measure Woollen, and Linnen Cloath, and in this Measure they allow 24 for 20 called the Merchants Auln; this City affords great store of Canvas for the Sails of Ships and such like uses, which is likewise Measured by the Auln, and has al∣lowance as aforesaid, tho not unless great quantities are bought. In this City 3 Fairs are yearly held, at 2 whereof Liberty for 15 days is granted to buy and Transport all Commodities of the growth Custom-free, provided the Commodities be laden and fallen down the River, to a Place limited within 15 days after, or else to pay Custom as at other times, the first of which be∣gins the 3d. day of <HI>February</HI> and ends the 18th, the second begins on Whit-Monday and lasteth 15 days, the third begins on the 23 day of <HI>October</HI> and continues 8 days only, and is not Custom-free as the for∣mer.</P>

<P><HI>PAris</HI> is the Principal city of <HI>France,</HI> and is accounted 10 Miles in Circumference, being Situate on either side the River <HI>Sein</HI>; that River Gliding smoothly through it, thereby rendering it more Commodious for Traffick; tho through the Sloath of the Inhabitants it is not improved to the ad∣vantage it might be, yet here are found Commodities of the growth of the whole Kingdom, as likewise of most Nations tho in no abundance.</P>
<P>The Commodities exported hence are Linnens, Paper, Cards, Combs, Stuffs, Thread, Plushes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which they re∣ceive
<PB N="204" REF="250"/>
English Cloath, Stockings, Lead, Tinn, Bays, old Shooes, Silks of <HI>Italy,</HI> and some <HI>Indian</HI> Commodities. The Inhabi∣tants are for the most part Gentry, and therefore not addicted to Manufa∣cture.</P>
<P>The Weights of <HI>Paris</HI> are the Quintal, which is accounted 100 pound Gross, but found to make 100 pound of <HI>London</HI> Suttle 2 <HI>per cent.</HI> more or less, and is of <HI>Lyons</HI> Weight of 16 Ounces 116 pound, and <HI>Venetian</HI> Sottle 144 pound, 100 Sottle in <HI>Venice</HI> making Sottle of <HI>Paris</HI> Weight but 62 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>/2 pound of 15 Ounces to the pound, the Cargo or great Quintal of <HI>Paris</HI> is 300 pound of Troy Weight, yet makes in <HI>Florence</HI> 487 pound. The Concave Mea∣sures for Wine is the Cistern, which con∣tains 8 Pints or a <HI>French</HI> Gallon, 96 of which are accounted a Tun.</P>
<P>The Measures of length are two, one for Linnen, and the other for Silks, and are much about the length of the vantaged and unvantaged Aulns, but seldom used in Gross, by Reason in this City Silks, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are sold by Weight, which to the buyer is advantageous by Reason he cannot be imposed on with slight Silks, and Stuffs, but that what it wants in goodness will be made out in Measure.</P>

<P><HI>LYons</HI> was once the famousest Mart of <HI>France,</HI> and a great Scale of Trade, but by Reason of its Incommodious Situ∣ation, in wanting a Port or Navigable Ri∣ver for great Ships, it has given place to the Haven Towns, yet continues some Trade, especially Inland, being Seated on a Fruitful Soil, Fertilized by the Branches of the Rivers <HI>Rhoan</HI> and <HI>Soame,</HI> the chief Manufactory of Silks in the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> being setled in it, which when wrought is sent through <HI>Europe,</HI> the Inha∣bitants having Commerce with <HI>Marselia,</HI> the chief Port for the residence of Ship∣ping. Here Exchanges are practised, the Bankers or Merchants of <HI>Venetia, Florence</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> having Factors resident in <HI>Lyons</HI> for that purpose, and hither it is that the
<PB N="207" REF="251"/>
English Merchants bring Lead, Tinn, Bays, Cony-Skins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to Exchange for the growth of the Province; the Accounts are kept as in other parts of the Kingdom. The Coyns currant being the same with those of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Fairs are 4, in which all payments either by Exchange or Merchandise are made, and all payments run from 3 Months to 3 Months, if agreed to in a Publick place or Burse appointed for that purpose; the first of these Fairs begins immediately after the Octaves of Easter, the second, the first Monday after the Assumption of the Bles∣sed Virgin, the third the day after All Souls, the fourth the day after Epiphany, each continuing 15 days; all Exchange business is done, and all Bills of Exchange are made and dated in one day, and within 2 days following, they settle the rate of Exchange, and by these Fairs they limit their payments, and the time allowed in their Bills from hence to <HI>Venice, Florence,</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> is com∣monly 30 days, to <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Valentia</HI> 25 days; and so consequently according to the distance of the place it is payable at, tho agreement be made for longer time it is of∣ten granted.</P>
<P>The Weights most in use is the Kings Beam of the Custom-House, and the 2
<PB N="208" REF="252"/>
Town Beams, the King's Beam is found to be 100 pound the Quintal, and is greater then the largest of the Town Beams by 8 <HI>per cent.</HI> and by the Weight thereof all Cu∣stoms are Proportioned. This large Town Beam for Gross Goods is accounted like∣wise 100 pound of 16 Ounces to the pound, the third Weight is known by the name of the pound of Mark, and is only used in weighing of Silks containing 100 pound of 15 Ounces, being the least of the three.</P>
<P>The Measure of <HI>Lyons</HI> is the Auln which is 46 English Inches, 7 of them being found to make 9 English Yards, and 100 pound of <HI>London</HI> Suttle is found to make in <HI>Lyons</HI> 96 2/2 pound Silk Weight, and one Liver or pound Sterling of <HI>London</HI> is 10 Livers <HI>Tur∣nois.</HI> And thus much shall Suffice for <HI>Lyons</HI> and the Trade thereof.</P>

The Exchange that is wanting here, is supplyed by the currant and intercourse of <HI>Lyons,</HI> it be∣ing Governed thereby in matters of Trade.</P>
<P>And hither the English bring Bays, Cloath, Lead, Tinn, Herrings, Pilchards, <HI>Newland</HI>-Fish, <HI>Affrican</HI> Hides, Wax, Calves-Skins, Salmond, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in Exchange receive Oyls, Wines, Verdigreese, Paper, Linnen, and other Manufactures, &amp; at this Port they have free Licence to Transport Spanish Ryals of 8/8
<PB N="210" REF="253"/>
which are found in abundance, and by that means preserve their Trade with <HI>Turky,</HI> and other Places of Traffick in the <HI>Medi∣terranean,</HI> from whence they bring Silks, and some spices; but of late have not been so venturous as formerly, for fear of the Pirates, by whom they have sustained with∣in a few Years dammages to the value of 3 Millions of Crowns, which has much im∣paired their Traffick in those parts.</P>
<P>The Accounts here are kept in Deniers, Solds, and Livers, and in Ryals of 8, which sometimes are Inhaunced to a ¼ part more then their true value.</P>
<P>The Weight is Originally the pound of 16 Ounces, 100 of which make the Quin∣tal, and 3 Quintals the Cargo, the Quintal is found to make English 88 ½.</P>

<P>IN Describing the Trade of this City from whence the Kingdom takes its Name, I shall lay down what is found of value or Merchantable throughout the Pro∣vince.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Naples</HI> is a fair City and accounted 7 Miles in compass, formerly called <HI>Parthenope,</HI> and is now Governed by a Vice-Roy to the Behoof of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and yieldeth divers Mettals brought from adjacent Mines; likewise Saffron, Raw and wrought Silk, Oyls, Anniseed, Brim∣stone, Argals, Corn, Cattle in abundance and other things of value; for which they receive out of <HI>England</HI> Bays, Says, Serges, Cloath, Lead, Tinn, Herrings, Pilchards, and <HI>Newland</HI>-Fish. There is found like∣wise the growth of <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and many <HI>East-Indian</HI> Commodities, and it was formerly a City of great Traffick. The
<PB N="213" REF="254"/>
Country generally abounds in Mulberry-Trees, and other pleasant Fruit-Trees.</P>
<P>The Weights of this City, and conse∣quently of the whole Kingdom, are the Roto∣lo and Cantar, 100 of the former making the latter, which is accounted 196 pound English Averdupois Weight, as likewise in <HI>Goeta</HI> they have a Cantar, by which all Gross Commodities are weighed which is reckoned 254 pound of <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>The Measure of Length is the Cane di∣vided into 8 Palms, nine of which Palms make the Auln of <HI>Lyons,</HI> and the Cane is 18 ½ English inches.</P>
<P>The Concave Measures of <HI>Naples</HI> are the Salmo and Staio, by which they Measure Oyl, Wine, Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Customs are for some Commodities 2 ½, for other 4 ½ <HI>per cent.</HI> more or less, as the Vice-Roy gives order to these that are appointed to receive them, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> receiving yearly for Customs upon the Oyls of <HI>Gallipoly,</HI> adjacent to this Kingdom one hundred thousand Ducats.</P>

the most part being very rich by Reason of the great Banks maintained in this Ci∣ty, where is practised exchange from all parts.</P>
<P>Their accounts are kept in Livers, Solds, Deniers, 12 Deniers making a Sold, and 20 Solds accounted a Liver, and some in Crowns, 7 ½ Livers making a Crown; they have currant in Trade, the <HI>Florence</HI> Ducat worth 7 Livers, each Liver accounted 9 pence Sterling.</P>

<P>Then this City is the fairest of <HI>Lomber∣dy,</HI> being seven Miles in compass, and Fur∣nished with all Commodities of the growth of the Dukedom, nay of all <HI>Italy,</HI> being now in Subjection to the <HI>Spanish</HI> King; the chief Commodities are Oyl, Wine, Rice, Corn, Raw Silk, which is wrought by the Inhabi∣tants into curious Fabricks, Chambets, Fu∣stians, Gold Thread, and Iron; which are dispersed over all <HI>Italy, Savoy, France, Flan∣ders, Holland, England, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>The Weight used here is the pound, 100 of which make a Quintal, which is account∣ed 70 pound English.</P>
<P>The Measures of Length are the Bra∣ces, one for Cloath, and the other for Silk, the 100 Braces of the last containing 43 Ells of <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>THe City of <HI>Venice</HI> gives Name to the Territories, and has been and yet is famous for Trade by Navigation, being so Commodiously Seated for the reception of Shipping, that nothing can be more; as thus, it is Seated at the bottom of the A∣driatick Sea or <HI>Venetian</HI> Gulph, upon 72 Islands 5 Miles distant from the main Land, and is defended against the rage of the Sea by a Bank of 20 Leagues, through which are cut several passages for Boats, but no Ships are capable of passing but at <HI>Mala∣mecco,</HI> the mouth of which is guarded with strong Castles; and at the Castles of <HI>Lio,</HI> the Sea runs through most of the Streets, so that the commerce is held by Boats and Bridges, 12000 of the first, and 4000 of the last; and as for the Inhabitants they are naturally addicted to Merchandise, and once made their City the Store-House of
<PB N="221" REF="258"/>
the Commodities of <HI>India, Persia, Arabia, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> being both Politick and Powerful at Sea, so that for those Com∣modities, most <HI>European</HI> Merchants Traded thither as the Principal Mart of the World, but of late the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Portugals</HI> have found the way to purchase them at the first hand, and by that means much im∣paired the Traffick of that Common-Wealth, yet still they have Factories at <HI>A∣leppo, Constantinople,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and Trade in Silk, Spices, Drugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the chief Commodities found here are Cloaths of Gold and Silver, Wine, Oyl, Woollen Cloath, Paper, Anniseeds, Agal, Looking-Glasses, Drinking-Glasses, and Quick-Sil∣ver, for which the English Merchants Trading thither, exchange Bays, Furs, Perpetuanos, Lead, Tinn, Cloves, Nut∣megs, Pepper, Ginger, Serges, Says, Woollen Cloath, Herring, Pilchards, Sal∣mond, and <HI>Newland</HI> Fish, Indico, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and serves for a Mart to <HI>Austria</HI> and upper <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The Weights of <HI>Venetia</HI> are 4, the first and greatest is called the pound Gross, and 100 pound with which they weigh Wool, Brass, Iron, Copper, Flesh, Fish, and other Gross Commodities. The second is the Golden Weight in use for weighing Gold,
<PB N="222" REF="259"/>
Silver, Precious Stones and Pearls only, and is called the Mark consisting of 8 Ounces, and each Ounce of 144 Cariots; the third is applyed to the Weight only of Gold and Silver Thread; the fourth is the pound Sut∣tle, with which are weighed Silks, Drugs, Spices, Cottons, Cotton-Yarn, <HI>viz.</HI> by the 100 Weight composed of the Suttle pound, 100 pound Gross being of this Sut∣tle pound 158 pound, and so on Proporti∣onablely; but in Gold and Silver Thread 100 pound Gross is Suttle, but 116 pound 8 Ounces, the Mark of Gold 8 Ounces, and from these our English Traders have derived their Weight commonly called <HI>Venice</HI> Weight, 100 pounds of <HI>Venice</HI> Sut∣tle make of <HI>London</HI> Weight 64 pound, and Gross 106 pound.</P>
<P>The Liquid Measures for Wine are the Amphora, the Bigonsa, the Quart, the Sachio and Lyre, <HI>viz.</HI> the Bigonsa 4 of them make the Amphora, and each Bigonsa is 4 Quarts, and 1 Quart is 4 Sachi, each Sachi being 4 Lyras, and each Lyra a pound Weight, tho in Gross the lesser Measures hold not out; as for Oyl it is sold both by Weight and Measure, the Weight is called the Staliero, and the Measure the Miaro, and is 40 Mire which is Gross Weight, 120 pound, one Mire by Weight is 30 pound 3 Ounces,
<PB N="223" REF="259"/>
and by Measure 25 pound. Corn is sold by the Staio, each Staio being Gross 132 pound of <HI>Venetian</HI> Weight.</P>
<P>The Accounts are kept several ways ac∣cording to the Pleasure of the Merchant, as sometimes in Ducats, and Grosses, ac∣counting 6 Livers, and 4 Solds to a Du∣cat or 24 Grosses, others again in Solds and Grosses.</P>
<P>As for their Exchanges, to their great advantage in way of Trade, they make a difference between their money payed for Merchandise, and that returnable upon Bills, the disproportion being between 20 and 21 <HI>per cent.</HI> their Customs are Extraordinary, especially upon the English Trading to <HI>Zant</HI> for Currans, which is in Subjection to that Seignory, both upon Goods imported and exported, the which has caused the decay of Trade, and was the main Reason of re∣moving the Scale of Trade to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> a place no ways so Commodious nor abounding in Commodities of the Native growth.</P>

<P><HI>LEghorn</HI> the Principal Port, and Scale of Trade in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, is Si∣tuated on a large Plain, and accomodated with a good Harbour for the reception of Shipping, so that almost the whole Scale of Trade is removed from the City of <HI>Ve∣nice</HI> thither; it is now a part of the <HI>Floren∣tine</HI> Dominion, having some time past been purchased by the Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI> for 120000 Ducats of the Genoese, and from him received large Priviledges and Immuni∣ties, being inlarged by a new City Build∣ed to the old, and by Reason of the small Customs taken there; it is of a Nest of Pirates, Murtherers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who formerly In∣habited it, become famous throughout the World; in this Port the great Duke keeps his Gallies, and here are found all the sorts of Commodities <HI>Italy</HI> yields, the Trade of it being as aforesaid regulated by <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Pisa,</HI> and to this Port are brought the

Commodities of <HI>England, Spain, France, Holland, India, Arabia, Persia, Egypt,</HI> and other Countries.</P>
<P>The Accounts of Merchants in <HI>Leghorn,</HI> are kept in Livers, Solds, Deniers, 12 Deniers being a Sold, and 20 Solds a Li∣ver, and their other monies are the same with <HI>Florence,</HI> except Quadrins and Cra∣ches, 8 Craches being accounted worth 6 pence Sterling, and of Quadrins 60 to a Liver, tho sometimes a different value is fixed upon the Mony of either place, but it continues not long.</P>
<P>The Weights are the same with <HI>Flo∣rence, viz.</HI> the pound of 12 Ounce, 100 of which make a Quintal, which is compu∣ted to make 75 pound English, and by this they weigh their Gross Commodities. An other Quintal they have of 150 pound, which makes of <HI>London</HI> Weight 113 pound, as also an other of 160 pound making with us 121 pound, by which they weigh Fish, woolls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Kintar of Allum is at <HI>Leghorn</HI> 150 pound, but in <HI>England</HI> found to make but 143 ⅞ pound, the Kintar of Sugar 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Kintar of Fish 160 pound, and make Eng∣lish Weight proportionably.</P>
<P>The Measures are the Brace and Cane, 4 of the former making one of the latter, each Brace being 23 Inches English, 100

<P>The Concave Measures for Corn and Salt, are the Stare, the Sack, and the Sal∣mo, 3 of the first making one of the second, and 3 ⅔ of the second making one of the third, which is a <HI>London</HI> Quarter; they have a Measure likewise called a Maggio, which contains 8 Sacks.</P>
<P>The Custom of this Port is, that any Merchant may Land his Goods without paying any Custom, so be they are sold with∣in a Year; but if not, he must pay Custom; but if for the better disposal of Commo∣dities, they are sent into any other part of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> they must pay Custom at <HI>Pisa.</HI></P>

the Citizens are turned Userers, which has put a stop to their Navigation, and the Excessive Customs upon Goods imported, deters Merchants from Trading thither to any purpose. The Merchantable Wares that are found in this City are Silks, Stuffs, Damasks, Drugs, Wine, Oyl, and some Fruits, for which they receive the growth of the Countries, whose Merchants Trade thi∣ther. Their Accounts especially as to Mer∣chandise are kept in Deniers, Solds, and Livers, 12 Deniers being a Sold, and 20 Solds a Liver, which is 16 pence Sterling. Their other Coyns for the most part Con∣cord with those of <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>The Weights are the pound of 12 Ounc∣es, and Quintal, 100 of the former mak∣ing the latter, which is accounted the Quin∣tal Suttle, the Gross Quintal being 150 pound, and makes Suttle Weight of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> 105 pound, and by the Gross Quintal are sold Anniseeds, Honey, Rice, Brass, Lead, Tinn, Sope, Wools, and other Weighty Commodities.</P>
<P>The Measure of Length is the Cane, found to make 9 Palms or 4 Braces of <HI>Florence,</HI> which is used in the Measuring Stuffs and Silkes, and for Measuring of Linnen, the Cane is 10 Palms, 100 of which Palms have rendered 27 English

<P>Corn is sold by the Mine, each Mine paying Custom 6 ½ Solds, and Weighs 270 pound, 2 ½ of which are found to be a <HI>Harwich</HI> Quarter.</P>
<P>Oyl is sold by the Barril, 7 ½ of which make a <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Butt.</P>
<P>Wine is sold by the Mesorole, 5 of which make a Botta Dimena of <HI>Na∣ples.</HI> All Goods entering the River or Port pay Consolato of the River 6 Denier <HI>per</HI> Liver, which is payed by the Buyer, if a contract be not before made with the seller for the discharge thereof.

<P>THe <HI>Papacy</HI> containeth several stately Cities, but none of any considerable Trade as for Merchandise therefore I shall Summ up all in Describing, the Trade of <HI>Rome,</HI> once the Mistriss of the World, but now her Splendor is much abated.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> is Situate on the Banks of <HI>Tiber,</HI> adorned with 750 Towers placed on her Walls, and is accounted to contain 466000 Families, and in it are found these Merchan∣dise, <HI>viz.</HI> Corn, Oyl, Wine, Gloves, Al∣lum, Lutestring, Kid-Skins, and curious Fabricks of Silk, for which they receive from <HI>England</HI> Lead, Tinn, Bays, Says, Stuffs, Pilchards, Herrings, <HI>Newland</HI> Fish, Calves-Skins, Salt, Salmon, Tallow, Wax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are for the most part Landed at <HI>Civitaveccia,</HI> and from thence carryed up the River <HI>Tiber</HI> in Boats to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The Coyns here and through the <HI>Pa∣pacy,</HI> are the same that are currant in most parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Pope having so ordain∣ed, that his Incomes may be the more.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="264"/>The Accounts are kept in Crowns, Ju∣lios, or Paulos, Baiochos, and Quatrins, the Weight is the Quintal or 100 pound which makes 80 pound English, tho some∣times they weigh by a Quintal of 160 pound, and 150 pound, according to the fineness or Grosness of the Commodity.</P>
<P>Their Measures of Length are 2, one for Linnen and the other for Woollen, the one a Brace, and the other the Cane, 30 Canes making 100 Braces.

Of these in order.</P>
<P><HI>Antwerp</HI> is Situate upon the River <HI>Scheld,</HI> that River sending forth eight Channels to Water the City by running through her Streets, and has been formerly accounted a great Scale of Trade, insomuch that all <HI>European</HI> Merchants brought their Commo∣dities thither to vend, the acquirement of which Trade was principally by the means following, first by Reason of 2 free Marts, yearly holden for 45 days, in which no Person Trading there could be Arrested in his Goods or Person for Debt or other∣wise, secondly by Reason the <HI>Portugals</HI> dis∣covering the <HI>East Indias Anno</HI> 1500. di∣verted the course of Trade driven by the <HI>Venetians</HI> from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and the Red-Sea to <HI>Lisbon</HI>; and so kept a Factory at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and exposed to Sail all <HI>Indian</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="265"/>
Commodities which drew most of the Trading Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> to Trade thi∣ther, exhausting the Trade of <HI>Bruges</HI> where the English Merchants Adventurers before resided; the third and last cause was the Wars between <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth Empe∣ror, and the <HI>French,</HI> which obliged the Nobility, and Gentry for safety to re∣move their Families thither, who after∣wards being taken with the pleasantness of the place would not remove, but Built them stately Houses, and made that City for the most part the Place of their resi∣dence.</P>
<P>The cause of the decay of Trade in the City of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> was the Wars with <HI>Spain,</HI> in which Merchants were Pillaged, their Ships taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Abridgement of Pri∣viledges, and the Trade which the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> found in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> bring∣ing home in their own Bottoms, what be∣fore they were obliged to the <HI>Portugals</HI> for; but as it is at this Day, a pretty Trade is driven in the City, most of the Neigh∣bouring Countries bringing in their Growth and Manufacture.</P>
<P>The Commodities found in <HI>Antwerp,</HI> are Wines, Silks, Arras-Hangings, Spices, Drugs, Fruit, store of Corn, Woollen Cloath, some Oyl, and the like; brought out of
<PB N="235" REF="265"/>
its Neighbourhood, and the Adjacent Pro∣vinces.</P>
<P>The Accounts of <HI>Antwerp</HI> are kept in Livers, Solds, and Deniers, which they reckon Pounds, Shillings, Pence, 12 De∣niers making a Sold, and 20 Solds a Li∣ver or pound Flemish, tho worth no more then 12 Shillings Sterling, or as they com∣pute it 240 Grosses, 12 Grosses being a Sold, and according to these Values on Coyn they make their Exchanges. The other currant Coyns are Doits, 4 of which make a Stiver, and 10 Stivers make 1 Shilling Sterling. 2 Blanks make a Stiver, and half 6 Stivers make the Flemish Shilling, 28 Stivers make a Guilder, which is 3 Shil∣lings 4 pence Flemish, so that 100 pound Flemish is found to make but 50 pound English, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Weight is the pound of 16 Ounces, 100 of which pounds make their Quintar, and the Quintar found to be 104 pound English. So that from this allowance or over Weight, many imagine that the Tret of <HI>London</HI> had its Original.</P>
<P>The Measure of length is the Ell, 100 of which are found to make 60 <HI>London</HI> Ells in the Measure of Linnen Cloath. They have likewise an Ell for Measuring of Silk, which is 1 ½ in the 100 less then the Cloath Ell.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="266"/>Beer is sold by the Barrel, which in <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> is accounted 54 Stops, each Stop being 2 Quarts English.</P>
<P>Their Corn they sell by the Vertules 23 ½ of which are a Last of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and 10 ¼ Quarters <HI>London</HI> Measure.</P>
<P>Wine is sold by the Ame, the Stop and the Butt, 1 Ame making 50 Stops, and one Stop 6 pound, so that the Butt is 300 Stops or 6 Ames, the Wine Stop being accounted 3 ⅓ Quarts of <HI>London</HI> Wine Measure.</P>
<P>The Exchanges are very great, by Reason most of the Bills of <HI>Spain</HI> are drawn upon the Merchants and Traders of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> for the disbursement of mo∣ney, for the maintainance of the Army, that is for the most part kept on Foot in the Provinces.</P>

<P>And by the addition or a new City to the old, it is become Commodious and strong; and by the advantage of the Ri∣ver passing through all Land-carriage is saved, the Boats in the 5 Principal Streets coming up to the Doors, especially where the Merchants Ware-Houses are. The Inhabitants are generally Prompt to Navi∣gation, and have so improved themselves thereby, that most of the Citizens are Merchants, and have Vessels of their own, or venture in other Vessels, wholly relying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the advantage that Accrues by Trad∣ing in forrain Countries, as wanting Land to improve their Stock at home, so that
<PB N="238" REF="267"/>
of late it has been observed they put out their Money to Interest in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> to more considerable interest then it will allow in their own Country; 4 or 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> being great interest there, which is so ordered that by such means, People may be the willinger to venture in way of Trade by Merchandise, which returns them for the most part 50. <HI>per cent.</HI> and all charges pay'd.</P>
<P>The Commodities found in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> as Silks, Cloath, Woollen, and Linnen, Stuffs, Drugs of all sorts, Spices, Dies, Oyls, Allum, Brimstone, Gold and Silver-Thread, Wines, and indeed all sorts of Commodities that are found of any use in the known World, but the chief Com∣modities that the Country affords, which may properly be called the Growth or Manufacture, are Cattle, Butter, Cheese, Flax, Corn, Linnen Cloath, Coarse Wool∣len Cloaths, Tapestry, Pictures, and all sorts of Fish, but especially Herrings, of which they make an Extraordinary advan∣tage, imploying in the Season for that Fishery 6000 Persons.</P>
<P>The Weight commonly used in <HI>Amster∣dam</HI> is the pound of 16 Ounces, 100 of which make 107 of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> 110.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="267"/>The Measure of length is the Ell, 134 of which make 100 Yards of <HI>London,</HI> or 100 <HI>London</HI> Ells make 167 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ells of <HI>Am∣sterdam.</HI></P>
<P>Their Concave Measures are for Corn, the Last, the Barrel, the Muyden, the Sack, the Archeteling, and the Sheple; as thus, 24 Barrels make the Last, each Barrel con∣taining 1 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2 Muydens, a Muyden containing 1 2/24 Sacks, each Sack being 3 Archetelings, or 3 21/29 Shepels 108 Shepels, making the Last.</P>
<P>The Measures for Wine, Oyl, Beer, and other Liquids, are for the most part the same with those of <HI>England</HI>; and therefore I shall pass them over.</P>
<P>The Coyns in which the Accounts are kept, are the same with <HI>Antwerp, viz.</HI> Li∣vers, Solds, and Deniers, the Liver or Pound Flemish being 12 Shillings Sterling, 6 Florins make the Flemish pound at 20 Sti∣vers <HI>per</HI> Florin, so that 120 Stivers are the Flemish pound or 12 Shillings Eng∣lish, 5 Stivers being 6 pence Sterling or 5 Solds Turnois, a Gross is 6 Deniers, a Carolus Gulden is 20 Stivers or 2 Shil∣lings Sterling, or 2 Sols Turnois.

all of its own Growth and Manu∣facture.</P>
<P>The Cities and Towns of the Empire, may by good Right be divided into 3 parts, as first the Hans-Towns, which enjoy large Privileges and Immunities, and are com∣puted to be about 70, which for the most par are accommodated with Navigable Ri∣vers, and abound in rich Manufactures. Secondly those called the Imperial Cities, which are imputed free Cities, by Rea∣son of their great Priviledges, above the rest in Coyning money, barring any acknow∣ledgement of Subjection unless to the Em∣peror, whom they only do acknowledge for their Protector, and in lieu of it pay an annual Tribute, being 60 odd in num∣ber. And thirdly those that are under the Subjection of the Electoral Princes, which are commonly called Principalities.</P>
<P>The Rivers by which these Towns for the most part are inriched are 4, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Danube</HI> which running 1500 Miles receives about 58 Navigable Rivers, and at last disimbogues it self into the <HI>Euzine</HI> or Black-Sea. The River <HI>Rhine</HI> which after passing through <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Belgia</HI> for 800 Miles falls into the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, the River <HI>Albis</HI> which is large and Navigable for near 400 Miles, and the River <HI>Odera,</HI> which passing

<PB N="243" REF="269"/>
who find great incouragement, and by their Labour is the common Stock improved; tho since its falling into the Hands of the <HI>French</HI> King, they have not proceeded with such Alacrity as formerly, by Reason of the little assurance they have of keeping what they acquire by their La∣bour.</P>
<P>The Commodities Traded for hither are Linnen Cloath, Iron, Diaper, Rhenish Wine, Copper, Wax, and Hemp, for which they receive out of <HI>England</HI> Tinn, Lead, and Woollen Cloath; out of <HI>Spain</HI> Fruits▪ Wines, Oyls, Salt, and Wool; and out of <HI>Italy</HI> Silks, both Raw and wrought.</P>
<P>The Weights are two, <HI>viz.</HI> the Gross and Suttle, where upon Tryal it has been found, that the 100 pound Suttle of <HI>London</HI> has made Incirca 70 in 71 of the Gross of <HI>Stras∣burg,</HI> which Gross Weight is 16 Ounces to the pound, and the Suttle but 12 Ounces, by the latter of which all <HI>Indian</HI> Com∣modities are weighed, as Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamond, Drugs of all sorts, Indicoes and rich Dies.

<P>The Weight is the pound, which in the Sale of some Commodities is divided in∣to 32 Coets, and in others into 128 Quints, and by some again into 512 Fennings, of this pound 100 makes the Quintar, which in <HI>London</HI> is found to make between 122 and 123 pound.</P>
<P>The Measures of length are 2, one for Linnen, and the other for Woollen, the 100 Yards of <HI>London,</HI> are found to make 103 Ells of <HI>Vienna</HI> Linnen Measure, and of the Woollen Measure 113 Ells.</P>

<P><HI>HAmburg</HI> is an Imperial City, Seated on a large Plain, and has on the South side the River <HI>Elve,</HI> being Accom∣modated with a fair Haven, cross which is cast a Chain to hinder Ships from entering without Licence; and on the North-East side, some distance from the Walls of the City runs the River <HI>Alster,</HI> and is adorned with many fair Buildings, fortifyed with strong Walls, Ditches, and Bulwarks. The Trade at present is very considerable, by Reason of the residence of our Merchants there, and the Factories held in other parts, it being the Key as it were of that part of <HI>Germany,</HI> whither the Inland Towns bring their Commodities to vend, as Quick-Silver, Stuffs, Silks, Cloath, Wine, Wax, Cor∣dage, Corn, and the like; most <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> Commodities are found here, and great quantities of the Growth of <HI>Spain,</HI> and here the English vend Cloath, Iron, Tinn, Lead, Drugs, Spices, and the like,
<PB N="247" REF="271"/>
receiving for them the Growth and Manu∣factures of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Weight is the pound; 120 of which are accounted the Quintar, which is divided into 3 parts or denominations, <HI>viz.</HI> the 12 Stone of 10 pound to the Stone, 300 pound are accounted the Skip pound, which is the second, &amp; that which is call'd the third, is 20 Lispound of 15 pound to the 300, which may be said to be one Quin∣tar of 120 pound, and another of 300 pound.</P>

And of the Islands I shall treat in their order. And first of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and the Trade there∣of.</P>
<P><HI>Copenhagen</HI> is the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the Seat of the <HI>Danish</HI> Kings, for the most part, being Commodiously Seated on the Sea-shore, and provided of a safe and goodly Haven, for the reception of Ship∣ping, being strongly Fortifyed and Beau∣tifyed with a Castle and other stately Edifices, which are for the more part possessed by Merchants that Trade there,

for the Growth and Manufacture of the Kingdom, which chiefly consists in Hides, Tallow, Fish, Bucks-Skins, Armour of all sorts, Furniture for Shipping, Corn, Cat∣tle and the like; for which they receive Drugs, Spices, Tinn, Lead, Gold, Silver, Silks, Woollen and Linnen Cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The currant Coyn is the Dollar and Shil∣ling, one Danish Shilling making one <HI>Lu∣beck</HI> Shilling, and 66 Danish Shillings ac∣counted to the Dollar, which is 5 Shillings Sterling.</P>
<P>The Accounts in this City are kept by Merchants, in Marks of 16 Shillings Da∣nish.</P>

<P><HI>ELsinore</HI> is Situate upon the Straight leading to the Sound, and greatly frequented by Seamen; by Reason of the Extraordinary passage through the Straight, for which every Vessel pays to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> a considerable Summ for permis∣sion, no Ships being otherwise capable to pass by Reason of the Castles that Guard that pass on either side, <HI>viz. Coronsburg,</HI> and <HI>Elsburg,</HI> the latter being in the Kingdom of <HI>Norway</HI>; on the East side of the Sealand near to <HI>Elsinore,</HI> the King has a Pallace for his Summer Recreation, which has a Prospect over the Sea, and 'tis reported that this Tole or Duty arising upon the passing and repassing over Ships into the Sound and Baltick, amounts to more then all the Crown Revenues besides. The Commo∣dities vended here are for the most part Fish, Cattle, Corn, Oyl, Beer, Cordage, Masts, Sails, and the like, for fitting out, and revictualling Ships, for which they re∣ceive the Growth of <HI>England, Holland, Ger∣many,</HI>
<PB N="251" REF="273"/>
and <HI>France</HI>; the Monies currant here are the same with those of <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>The Weights are as in <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and in most parts of the Kingdom, the great and shall 100, the former being accounted 120 pound to the 100, and the latter 112 pound, being accounted 12 Stone of 10 pound to the Stone; they have likewise a Skip-pound of 32 Stone of 10 pound the Stone, or 20 Lispound of 16 Mark pound is a Skip-pound, and 20 times pounds 16 are 320 pound.</P>
<P>The Measures of the Kingdom in General are for Length, are the Ells for Woollen, Linnen, and Silks, 160 of which are ac∣counted to make the 100 Ells English. As for Concave Measures they are little in use unless for Corn. The Trade of this King∣dom by Navigation is but small, they sel∣dom Sailing out of their own Seas, or at most, no further then the <HI>German, British,</HI> and <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Seas or Oceans.

<P><HI>NOrway</HI> is bounded on the West and South with the Ocean, and on the East and North with <HI>Lappia,</HI> and the <HI>Dofrine</HI> Mountains, and abounds in Firr-Trees, which are brought into <HI>England</HI> in abun∣dance and serve for Masts, Boards, and Building Houses; the other Commodities are Stock-Fish, Furs, Train Oyl, Cor∣dage, some Rossen and Sail-Cloaths. The Towns by Reason of the coldness of the Clime and Dampness caused by the Sea are but few, the chief being <HI>Nidrosia</HI> and <HI>Ber∣gen,</HI> once a famous Mart, but now reduc∣ed to nothing in respect of Trade, the Trade that it had having passed through several Cities, is at last setled in <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI> and what Trade does remain is from the Ships that pass this way to <HI>Mosco∣via.</HI></P>
<P>The Weight most in use is the pound, 100 of which renders 92 <HI>London</HI> Averdu∣pois Weight, tho of late they have got a Custom to Weigh in a String, which is
<PB N="253" REF="274"/>
very uncertain, rendering sometimes more, sometimes less. Their Measure of Length and Concave Measures, the latter of which is for the most part used in Measuring of Salt, are agreeable to our Yard and Bu∣shel.</P>
<P>The Commodities vended here are Bays, Says, Linnen, Wine, Spices, Sugars, Gun∣powder, Lead, Tinn, Iron, and such like.

the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Kingdom; and Seated in a Watery Marsh in the nature of <HI>Venice,</HI> and is much frequented with Merchants, being for the most part the Regal Seat, so that to it Flow all the Commodities of the Kingdom; which are chiefly Buck-Skins, Goats-Skins, Ox Hides, Barly, Tallow, Malt, Tar, Pitch, Rosin, Furs, Lead, Cop∣per, Silver, Iron, Wax, Honey, and the like; and for its advantageous Situation, it is much Traded to, having a Channel capable of receiving Ships of any Burthen; and so well guarded with Castles of Extraordi∣nary Strength, that no Ship can pass in nor out without lieve first obtained; the Build∣ings are pleasant to behold for their Anti∣quity and fine Devices; a place being pur∣posely erected in the Principal Street, for the conveniency of Merchants, and the lay∣ing up such Commodities, as they either have to vend or have purchased; so that in this City are found the Growths and Manu∣factures of almost all Nations.</P>
<P>The currant Coyn of this Kingdom is the Dollar, which is divided into 8 Marks, and each Mark into 2 Clippings, each Clipping being accounted 9 ½ Stivers Fle∣mish, and in exchange the Dollar is only used.</P>
<P>The Weight is the pound 116 of which
<PB N="255" REF="275"/>
is found to make the 100 pound of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>; they have likewise 2 Skip-pounds, the one the proper Skip-pound of <HI>Stock∣holm,</HI> which is 320 pound of the before mentioned pound, the other is 340 pound and proper to <HI>Dantzick.</HI> Of which in order I shall come to Treat.</P>
<P>The Measure of Length is the Ell, 166 of which are 100 Yards of <HI>London</HI> Measure, sometimes more sometimes less; for this is the Rule, they take a Piece of Rope, and Measure it by the bigness of a mans Head, which they call their Ell, so that according to the largeness or small∣ness of the Head, by which they take their Measure, the Measure is found to consist.</P>
<P>Their Concave Measures are of little use, unless for Corn and Mault, and those are Measured by a Loop, 23 of which make a Last in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and in <HI>London</HI> 10 Quar∣ters. And thus much shall Suffice for <HI>Sweed∣en,</HI> and the Trade thereof.</P>

<P>These Provinces abound in Corn, Cat∣tle, Furs, Hides, Flax, Hemp, Whales, Grease, Canvas, Ropes, Cavier, Tallow, Honey, Wax, Venison, Flax, Hemp, and Fish. The Trade being begun by the English about the Year 1575 in general, tho before some Vessels of Private Mer∣chants had Traded thither, and found out the Commodities since so much sought af∣ter;
<PB N="257" REF="276"/>
and upon the increase of Trade in these parts, a Society of Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> are incorporated by the Name of <HI>Muscovia</HI> Merchants, having setled a Facto∣ry at <HI>Archangel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mosco</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Moscovia,</HI> is Seated on the River <HI>Mosca,</HI> which falls in to <HI>Tanais</HI>; this City is reckoned 6 Miles in compass, and is for the most part the imperial Seat, being much Beautifyed since it was Burnt by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> upon their invading the <HI>Moscovite</HI> Empire; and here the English Merchants find kind enter∣tainment, unless in Troublesome times, as of late it happened upon the murther of the <HI>Czar,</HI> in which general Calamity ma∣ny suffered in their Goods; but now things are again reduced to a quiet and setled con∣dition, so that Trade again begins to Flo∣rish, the Country affording great store of Furs, as Beaver, Otter, Sables, White, Black, Red, and Dun Fox-Skins, with many others of the like nature; which are sold by the Timber, Weight, or Tale, be∣ing highly valued of late by the Natives, who perceiving the desire Merchants have for them, learn thereby to set prices on them accordingly.</P>
<P>The Merchants Accounts are kept here Divers ways, as those of <HI>England</HI> in Ru∣bles
<PB N="258" REF="277"/>
and Pence, called by the Natives Mus∣kofkins, 200 of which make a Ruble, which is rated at 2 Rix Dollars, the <HI>Dutch</HI> by Rubles, Grevens, and Muscof∣kins, 20 pence being accounted to the Gre∣ven, and 10 Grevens to the Ruble which is only an Imaginary Coyn.</P>
<P>The currant money is the Capeck worth a Stiver Flemish, and something more in value then an English penny, 10 of which make a Greven, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h is worth 12 pence Sterling, and the Ruble 10 Shillings Ster∣ling, 3 Capecks is called an Altine, by which name all receipts of Bargain, and contracts are made, 33 Altines and one Capeck making the Ruble.</P>
<P>At <HI>Archangel</HI> there is exchange practised, and the price of monies Russ as the Plenty or Scarcity will allow, for sometimes the Rubles in exchange pass for 11 Shillings 6 pence Sterling, the Receipts being in <HI>August,</HI> to return in <HI>London</HI> about the lat∣ter end of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>The Weight most in use is the Pood, by which all fine Goods are weighed, as Silk, Beavor, Wool, and the like; but for Gross Goods they have a Weight cal∣led a Berzovet accounted 10 Poods or the Russ Ship-pound computed to be 360 pound Averdupois, so that all Goods bought by

this Weight, are accounted to be 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> profit, so that many have reck∣oned the Goods so bought to pay the Fraight with over Weight; and all Goods bought by the Pood are reckoned 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> less.</P>
<P>The Measure of Length is called the Archin, and is accounted 28 English Inch∣es, so that the 100 Archings are suppos∣ed to produce Incirca 78 Yards of <HI>London</HI> Measure.</P>
<P>Oyl they sell by the Barrel, each Bar∣rel being accounted ½ a Hogshead, and Tar by the Hogs-head; as for Concave Measures I observe, they are but rarely in use by way of Trade, by Reason of the small quantities of Commodities the Empire affords, that are proper to be Measured thereby. Therefore I shall put a conclusion to the Trade of <HI>Moscovy,</HI> and proceed to a View of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Cracovia</HI> is the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> Situate on the Banks of the River <HI>Vistula,</HI> which is Navigable for near 400 Miles, being as it were incompassed with distant Mountains, and fortifyed with strong Walls and fair Buildings; being the Seat of the Kings of <HI>Poland,</HI> and is found to produce the Commodities of the whole Kingdom, as Tar, Rosin, Pitch, Hemp,
<PB N="261" REF="278"/>
Wax, Honey, Barly, Oats, Amber, Tal∣low, and Hides, which Commodities are sent up the River; and distributed to such Merchants as come to Trade for the Growth of the Kingdom. There are likewise found Furs of divers sorts, some Minerals, and the like; for which the Inhabitants re∣ceive the Commodities of divers Nations which are brought both by Land and Sea.</P>
<P>The Coyns of this City, and consequent∣ly of the Kingdom, are the Ducat of Gold called the <HI>Polander</HI>; which is accounted 70 Polish Gross. The Silver Guilden which is worth 30 Polish Groshe or 2 Shillings Sterling, a Dollar in <HI>Specie</HI> is worth 4 Polish Groshes, but in all contracts of buy∣ing and selling, the Doller is accounted 36 Groshe, a Crietszar is worth 3 Pot-chanels, 18 Deniers make one Groshe, a Groshe of <HI>Poland</HI> or <HI>Bohemia</HI> is worth 7 Whites, 16 Whites make one Ort, 4 0rts make a Dollar, and a Dollar is accounted 4 Shillings 4 pence. The Weight is the pound, 136 of which is accounted the Quin∣tar, which is found in <HI>London</HI> to render 114 pound, and the 100 of <HI>London</HI> yield∣eth 120 of <HI>Cracovia,</HI> but the common pound is reduced to a Stone of 40 pound, 10 of the said Stones being accounted the
<PB N="262" REF="279"/>
Skip-pound. The Measure of Length is the Ell, 20 of which are 10 English Ells, but their Linnen they sell by the Shock, the Shock being 57 ½ English Ells.</P>
<P>And to this City it will not be amiss to add <HI>Elbin,</HI> once a Scale of Merchandise, where the English Merchants had a Facto∣ry, being here known by the Name of the Merchants of <HI>Elbin,</HI> but since this City has fallen into the Hands of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> it has lost the great Trade it had upon the Abridgement of the Liberties and Priviledges it enjoyed, during its being in the possession of the Teutonick Knights, so that now it only is famous for what it has been, and not for what it at present remains, the Trade being dispersed into several Eastland Cities, or Hans Towns, but from <HI>Danzick</HI> especially are brought Soap-Ashes.</P>
<P>The Weights are the Pound and Stone, 40 pound making the Stone, and 40 of those Stones make the Ship-pound, which is 400 pound, and 100 pound of <HI>London</HI> is found to make 120 of <HI>Elbin.</HI> Their Last of Wheat is reckoned to weigh 5200 pound. Their Measure of Length is the Ell, 163 of which make 100 <HI>London</HI> Yards. In this Tract is found <HI>Coninsberg, Rhiga, Stetin, Stralesond,</HI> and <HI>Revel,</HI> from the former

Mines, of Gold and Silver, Salt-Pits, Wines; and Mountains of Brimstone, which Commodities they send to <HI>Constan∣tinople, Aleppo,</HI> and other Marts of the <HI>Turk∣ish</HI> Empire, and receive in exchange the Commodities of all Nations, as for Weights and Measures, they are rarely in use, they selling and buying for the most part by those of the Marts, whether they resort with their Commodities; their Coyns are those currant throughout the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em∣pire. Of which I shall come to speak, in the View of <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sclavonia</HI> is bounded on the South with the Adriatick Sea, on the North with <HI>Hun∣gary,</HI> on the West with <HI>Italy</HI> part, and on the East with the River <HI>Drinus,</HI> and a Line that passes from thence to the Sea; and is chiefly divided into 2 parts, <HI>viz. Illyria</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> the name of the former being lately by the <HI>Turks,</HI> changed into that of <HI>Windismark,</HI> the which abounds in Butter, Cheese, Cattle, Corn, Oyl, Wine, Hemp, Wool, Wax, Honey, Tallow, Iron, and the like. Of <HI>Dalmatia, Rhagusa</HI> is the Prin∣cipal City, so that I will not be amiss to reduce the Trade of that Province, which is not Extraordinary into its <HI>Metropolis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rhagusa</HI> formerly called <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> is Seated on the Adriatick Shoar, and was
<PB N="266" REF="281"/>
once a Common-Wealth of great Traffick, and the first in those parts that Furnished out Ships of War of considerable force, with which they awed their Neighbours, and gave Laws in those Seas, but since the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Navigators have turned the currant of Traffick another way, and drained those parts of the Commerce that was wont to Flow in upon them like the Ocean. The Inhabitants are no ways considerable, yet the Commodities of the Province are found there, as Honey, Wax, Horses for War, Hides, Tallow, Silver, and Gold unrefined, some Amber, Corral and the like, but of small value; for which they receive of those English, that make Trading Voyages, <HI>Hampshire</HI> Carsies, and other Coarse Cloath, Lead, Tinn, and such like; and that mostly for provision.</P>
<P>The Coyns in use here is the Gross, 59 of which are accounted a Sultany, or 8 Shillings Sterling.</P>
<P>The Weight is the pound 100 of which make 80 pound English, which is the Quin∣tal of <HI>Rhagusa.</HI> Their Measure of Length is the Brace, according with the <HI>Venetian</HI> Brace, thus, 100 Braces of <HI>Rhagusa</HI> of the Cloath Brace, are 120 in <HI>Venice</HI> of the same, and of the Silk Brace 116 of <HI>Venice</HI> make the 100 of <HI>Rhagusa.</HI> And thus leaving <HI>Hun∣gary,

<P><HI>GReece</HI> famous for being once Mistriss of the Vniverse, is bounded on the South with the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea, on the North with the Mountain <HI>Hemus,</HI> on the East with the <HI>Hellispont, Aegean</HI> Sea, <HI>Propontis,</HI> and the <HI>Thracian Bosphorus,</HI> and is Ferti∣lized by these considerable Rivers; <HI>viz.

<P>The famous City of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> once
<PB N="268" REF="282"/>
the Seat of the Roman Eastern Empire, and now of the Ottoman Emperor, for the most part is Seated upon a large Stream, that passeth from the <HI>Euxine</HI> to the <HI>Medi∣terranian</HI> Sea, commonly called the Black and White Seas, so that by such means Ships from either Sea have a free passage, which causes a quicker return then otherwise could be made, by Reason from one part or other the Wine rarely fails: It Fronts likewise <HI>Asia,</HI> receiving most of the Commodities by Sea and Land that are found in that large quarter of the World, and stands as it were the Bulwark of <HI>Europe,</HI> lastly founded by <HI>Constantine</HI> the great, and made the Seat of the Roman Empire as aforesaid, being taken after a long Siege by the Turks <HI>Anno</HI> 1453, who ever since have possessed it, it being Build∣ed in a Triangle, having the 2 large Angles Bordering on the Sea, and the other stretch∣ed into the Land, and is incompassed with a Triple Wall, upon which are divers Towers, and the Walls themselves Guard∣ed by deep Ditches, and Cannons all a∣long the works to the Sea; the Buildings for the most part are very stately, but especially the Grand-Signeours Pallace, on the point of the Angle, being surrounded with a Wall of 3 Miles in compass, and
<PB N="269" REF="282"/>
strong works furnished with great and small Artiliry.</P>
<P>This City is the common Mart for all Commodities of the Empire, receiving &amp; dis∣persing inwards and outwards the growth of each Province: And hither the Merchants of <HI>London</HI> first began to Trade <HI>Anno</HI> 1586, and in a short time found such incourage∣ment upon Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> sending an Ambassador to mediate on their behalf; that they soon obtained to be incorporated by the said Queen, and growing in Trade, were confirmed by King <HI>James,</HI> with an Augmentation of their Priviledges, and then by King <HI>Charles</HI> the first, under the Title of the Merchants of <HI>England,</HI> Trading in the <HI>Levant</HI> Seas, or <HI>Levant</HI> Merchants, up∣on whose account a Leiger Ambassador re∣mains at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to protect the Com∣panies Factories, and take care that right be done them, who before his departure from <HI>England,</HI> is always approved of by his Majesty, but himself and retinue have their charges defrayed by the Company, which Honourable trust now remains in the right Honourable the Lord <HI>Shandois,</HI> they have likewise several Consuls to protect their Factories throughout the Empire, who keep Janizaries, Druggermen or Interpreters, Secretaries, and Ministers,
<PB N="270" REF="283"/>
with other the like necessary attendants in Sallary, being permitted free exercise of Religion: And hither it is at present that the English are found the Principal Trad∣ers, tho the <HI>Venetians, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> by sundry devices have indeavoured to in∣sinuate themselves, into the good opinions of the Turkish Merchants; who are ac∣counted 4 kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> the Native <HI>Greek,</HI> the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and lastly the <HI>Jews.</HI> The chief Commodities found here are Grograms, Mohairs, Chamlets, <HI>Persian</HI>-Silk, wrought and unwrought Gold, Car∣pets, Anniseeds, Cumminseeds, Cottons, Galls, Pepper, Jndico, Nutmegs, Cinamon, Mace, and Drugs, these last being the Commodities of the <HI>East-India's,</HI> are brought cheaper and better from thence, therefore not Traded for by the English at <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> but rather carryed by them thither, and exchanged for the Growth of the Em∣pire, as likewise Lead, Tinn, Cloath, Furs, as Martins, Cony-Skins, Sables, Titchues, and the like; at the change of every Am∣bassador, the Company make a present to the Grand-Signeour, which is levyed by the Company themselves by way of im∣position, the like are the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> obliged to do upon some occasion, and for the support of their Factories and Ambas∣sadors.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="283"/>The Accounts are kept in Dollars and Aspers, a Dollar being computed 80 Aspers, tho sometimes in way of Merchandise 100 Aspers are accounted to the Dollar, and and 120 Aspers to the Sultany.</P>
<P>The Coyns currant in this City, and consequently throughout the Empire are the Sultany of Gold, agreeing with the <HI>Venice</HI> Chequin, or is as aforesaid 120 As∣pers, the <HI>German</HI> Dollar, the Ryal of 8/8 Spanish, currant at 80 Aspers; the <HI>Lyons</HI> Dollar is currant at 75 Aspers, the <HI>German</HI> Sesetine at 70 Aspers, and indeed any Coyn if found good Gold or Silver is currant in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and most parts of the Empire; a Policy used to procure plenty of Coyn, for the maintainance of the <HI>Jan∣izaries</HI> and others, in pay of all Nations.</P>
<P>The Weights are the Grain, 4 of which make a Quillat, a Dram which is 16 Grains of which all greater Weights are composed by Multiplication: as a Yursdrome is 100 Drams, and found to be 1 pound Sotile of <HI>Venice,</HI> or 72 Mittigals: a Lodero is 176 Drams, or 19 ½ Ounces Averdupois: an Oake is 400▪ Drams accounted 2 pound 11 ½ Ounces: 100 Lodero's are accounted 24 Oaks; and compose the Quintar of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> which has been found to render be∣tween 118 and 120 pound English Suttle.
<PB N="272" REF="284"/>
A Batman is 6 Oaks, or 16 ⅓ pound Eng∣lish, by which all Silks are bought, and according to these all other Weights of the Empire are regulated.</P>
<P>The Measures of Length are the Pico's, which are 3. The first for Cloath which is accounted 26 ½ Inches.</P>
<P>The second for Grograms, Chamlet, and such like, containing 24 Inches, so that 24 of these Pico's are found to make 16 Eng∣lish Yards. The third is the Linnen Pico, which is the former doubled. To none of these is any advantage allowed as in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>The Concave Measure is called the Kil∣low, by which for the most part Corn is Measured, 8 ⅔ of which are observed to make the <HI>London</HI> Quarter, Wines, Oyls, and almost all Liquids are sold by the Me∣ter, weighing 8 Oaks, and is about ⅔ of an English Gallon, as indeed most Commodities are sold by Weight.</P>
<P>The Customs payed by the <HI>Italians, French,</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> outward and inward are 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> themselves pay nothing, the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> pay 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> inward, and the like outward, which is payed in Specie, unless the Merchant does compound with the Customer for money; and further it is to be observed, that, besides these Customs,
<PB N="273" REF="284"/>
there is by agreement payed 1 ½ <HI>per cent.</HI> up∣on all pondrous Commodities, and 1 up∣on all Measurable Commodities, which is to be defrayed between the buyer and sel∣ler, but if a <HI>Turk</HI> be one, his part is remit∣ted, and this is levyed for the Maintain∣ance of a Hospital founded by <HI>Sultan Ach∣met,</HI> which duties are farmed by an Emine or Farmer call'd the Grand-Seigenors re∣ceiver, and are most commonly payed the one half in Aspers, of 80 Aspers to the Dollar, and the other in Sultanies of Gold, or otherwise as the Merchants and Cu∣stomer can agree. And thus having at large described the Trade of this great City, I shall proceed to take a View of the Islands of note, lying in the <HI>Egean, Ionian, Mediterranian,</HI> and Adriatick Seas.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCII. A View of the Islands in the <HI>Ionian, Ege∣an, Mediterranean,</HI> and Adriatick Seas; with a Description of the Trade, Weights, Measures, Coyns, and Commodities of the Growth and Manufacture of the most con∣siderable of them.</HEAD>
<P>THe Islands in these Seas are many, therefore I shall only name those of little note and insist upon the chief.</P>
<P>First then there is found the Island of <HI>Te∣nedos,</HI> abounding with Wines.</P>
<P>The Isle of <HI>Samothracia,</HI> commodious for the Harbouring Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Lemnos</HI> from whence comes that Antidote, called <HI>Terra Sigilata,</HI> or <HI>Terra Lemnos,</HI> then <HI>Scio</HI> or <HI>Chios,</HI> abounding in Trees, from which they distill Mastick, which Commodi∣ties the Grand Signeour claims as his right.</P>
<P>Next the famous Island of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> which by Reason of its commodious Situation in the Ocean, is found to be a Place of great resort. In the chief City from which the Island takes name, is a considerable Mart, affording Corn, Wines, Oyls, Rasins, Wax, Honey, Cotton, Cordovants, Cotton Wools,
<PB N="275" REF="285"/>
and Cotton Yarn, Dimities, Vermilions, Damask, Stuffs, Silks, and the like; be∣ing the Commodities of divers Islands in those Seas, and here some Factories are maintained; and the Accounts kept in Aspers of <HI>Turky,</HI> and the other Coyns for the most part the same. The Weight is the Rotolo, 100 of which makes the Quintar or 536 pound English. The Measure of Length is the Cane, which is found to be 84 Inches of English.</P>
<P>The next Island that offers, is the fa∣mous Island of <HI>Candia,</HI> which cost the <HI>Turks</HI> so dear a purchase. Therefore I shall not think it amiss to describe its Commodities, Weights, and Measures.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="93" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XCIII. A View of the Isle <HI>Candia</HI> and other I∣slands.</HEAD>
<P>THe Isle of <HI>Candia</HI> is Seated in the Mouth of the <HI>Egean</HI> Sea, and is now in sub∣jection to the Grand-Signeor, being ex∣ceeding Fruitful and affords considerable Commodities, as Muskadels, Fine-Sugars, Gums, Honey, Wax. Dates, Oranges, Li∣mons,
<PB N="276" REF="286"/>
Olives, Rasins, Corn, Cattle, Fish, and the like; containing several Cities of note as <HI>Candia</HI>; from whence the Island has its name, <HI>Canea, Rhettmio, Sittia,</HI> and <HI>Suda,</HI> being a Haven capable of receiving 1000 or 1500 large Vessels, and before the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI> lost it, their Coyns were currant throughout the Island, and their Weights the Quintars Suttle and Gross. The Gross 100 of <HI>Candia</HI> rendering 110 of the like Gross Weight of <HI>Venice,</HI> or 118 English pound, and 100 pound Suttle of <HI>Candia,</HI> 114 pound of <HI>Venice</HI> Suttle, or 76 pound English. The Measures of Length are the Pico's, one for Cloath, another for Silk, and their Measure for Wine called the Me∣stach; but the <HI>Turks</HI> have since their con∣quest made some alteration in the Weights, Measures, and Coyns which as yet are not come to my knowledge, I not having been there since the reduction.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ionian</HI> Sea are also found the Isle of <HI>Cerigo,</HI> abounding with Marble, the <HI>Strophades</HI> or <HI>Strivalia,</HI> the <HI>Cursalari</HI> Islands, and <HI>Corfue,</HI> the last of which abounds in Wax, Honey, Oyl, and Wine, Stuffs, Silk-Fabricks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is likewise found St. <HI>Mairo, Ithaca, Zeffalonia,</HI> and <HI>Zant,</HI> the 3 latter of which are famous for the Cur∣rans found growing there in abundance, and
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
from thence dispersed throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> but mostly spent in <HI>England,</HI> wherefore I shall somewhat inlarge in describing the Trade thereof.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCIV. A View of <HI>Zant, Zeffalonia, and Ithaca,</HI> together with their Trade, Commodities, Weights, Measures, Coyns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Commodities that these Islands prin∣cipally afford are Honey, Wax, Oyl, Wine &amp; Currans, being Subject to the Signeo∣ry of <HI>Venice</HI>; and hither it is that the Eng∣lish Trade for Currans, now being of great use; and from whence they yearly bring 3000 Tuns or upward, which at first they bought for small matters, but the <HI>Veneti∣ans</HI> seeing that Fruit so much coveted, be∣gan to inquire into the use they were put to, the which when they found, and there∣upon imagined the English could not Sub∣sist without them, the better to recover the lost Trade of <HI>Venice</HI>; that State im∣posed a Tax of 5 Ducats upon every 1000 Weight, which is since Augmented, not∣withstanding the Custom payed in <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
with this Proviso; that the Currans be laden in a Vessel that comes purposely to lade that Commodity, but if She Landeth her outward Fraight in <HI>Venice</HI> or ⅔ part thereof, and then goeth to Lade at any of these Islands, the Customs then are mo∣derated.</P>
<P>For the Growth of these Islands; the English Merchants Exchange Cloath, Per∣petuano's, Serges, Lead, Tinn, Herrings, <HI>Newland</HI>-Fish, and Pilchards, tho the great∣est Trade is for Spanish Ryals; all the o∣ther money currant amongst the Islanders, being the same with that of <HI>Venice.</HI> The Natives keeping their Accounts as in <HI>Venice,</HI> tho Merchants Strangers often keep theirs in Dollars, which are those Ryals of 8/8 and Gassets 80 to the Dollar.</P>
<P>The Weight is the pound of 12 Ounces, 100 of which pounds make the Quintar, and agrees with <HI>Venice,</HI> thus the 100 pound Suttle of <HI>Venice</HI> make but 63 ½ pound of these Islands, and the Gross hundred of <HI>Venice</HI> renders but the common 100 pound. Currans are bought by the 1000, which 1000 Weight is reckoned to make 1070 pound English, tho of late by the careles∣ness of the Factors, or defraud of the Island∣ers, it is found much less.</P>
<P>The Measures of Length are the two Brac∣es,
<PB N="279" REF="287"/>
the long and the short, the long is for Woollen and Linnen Cloath, and the short for Silks, the former being found 27 Eng∣lish Inches, and the latter to be 6 in 7 <HI>per cent.</HI> lesser.</P>
<P>Oyl is sold by a Measure called the Li∣ver, and is computed to weigh 13 pound English, 10 of which make a Candia, Bar∣rel. Wine is sold by the Jar 3 ½ of which make the Candia Barrel. Corn they sell by the Bechelo 3 of which are accounted the Starro, and should weigh 44 pound, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Customs raised upon the Commo∣dities of these Islands yearly, are between 40 and 50000 Chequins of Gold; which are the Income of the Signory of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>The Islands found in the Adriatick Sea are <HI>Absertides, Cherso, Vegea, Grissa, Leli∣va, Cursola, Brassia, Lissia,</HI> and <HI>Zara,</HI> which yield Wine, Corn, Oyl, Cattle, and the like; but enjoy at this Day little or no Trade, except <HI>Zara</HI> the chief of them. And therefore I shall pass them over, and enter the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> to take a View of the Islands Seated therein.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCV. Of the Islands in the <HI>Mediterranian</HI> Sea, and the Trade of the Principal of them.</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Mediterranian</HI> Sea are found these Islands <HI>viz. Sicilia, Malta, Corsica, Sar∣dinia, Majorica,</HI> and <HI>Minorica,</HI> of the chief of which in order.</P>
<P><HI>Sicilia</HI> is the chief of these Islands, com∣puted 700 Miles in circuit; Fertilized with many Navigable Rivers, and adorn∣ed with many fair Cities, and is divided in 3 Provinces as <HI>Vallis-de-Nota, Masara,</HI> and <HI>Mona.</HI> In this Island is found the Flaming Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> and Mount <HI>Hiblia,</HI> in which is found great store of Honey, but for Brevities sake, I shall reduce the Trade of this Island into that of <HI>Messina</HI> the chief Port thereof, which stands oppo∣site to <HI>Regio</HI> in <HI>Calabria,</HI> the Island being divided from <HI>Italy</HI> by a narrow Frith or Channel, commonly called the Fare of <HI>Mes∣sina,</HI> and formerly accounted dangerous for Sailors, by Reason of a Rock on the one side, and a Sand on the other, known by the names of <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charibdis.</HI></P>
<P>This City for some Years past, has been
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
Garisoned by the <HI>French,</HI> which put a stop to Inland Commerce, by Reason that the other Cities were in possession of the <HI>Spani∣ard,</HI> but since their abandoning it, the Trade is again returned, many Merchants of note residing there, and by Reason of its Com∣modiousness for the reception of Shipping, it has acquired a great Trade, so that hi∣ther are brought the Commodities of the whole Island, as Wines, Oyls, Wax, Ho∣ney, Saffron, Sugars, Corral, Agates, Pu∣mice, Corn, Cattle, Hides, Skins, Cavear, Tuny Fish, and the like; so that altho <HI>Pa∣lermo</HI> is the chief City and residence of the Spanish Vice-Roy, yet this is the chief Scale of Trade.</P>
<P>The Merchants keep their Accounts in Ounces, Tarries, and Grains, one Ounce making 30 Tarries, and 1 Tarry 20 Grains, and by the same they account their mo∣ney, <HI>viz.</HI> one Ounce or 30 Tarries is 5 Florins or Carlins, 12 Carlins making the Florin, one Tarry is accounted 12 Solds, 6 Deniers, or one Carline, the Carline being 10 Grains or 12 Livers, one Grain is 6 Pi∣cholis, and is 7 ½ Dew money of Siciliano, one Pancto is 8 Picholis, and the Ducat of Gold is worth 13 Tarries, and this money is cur∣rant throughout the Island.</P>
<P>The Weights of <HI>Messina</HI> are two, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
the Gross Cantar, by which they weigh all manner of Gross Commodities, the small or Suttle Cantar 10 pound less then the former, and is 100 Rotolo's of 30 Ounces, or 2 ½ pound Siciliano pounds, the former having been found to make 196 in 198 pound English, 20 Peso's being accounted the Suttle Cantar, and 22 the Gross Can∣tar.</P>
<P>The Measure of Length is the Cane, di∣vided into 8 Palms or 81 ½ Inches <HI>London</HI> Measure.</P>
<P>The Concave Measures are the Salmo and Tomelo, 16 of the latter making the former, which is accounted 11 ¼ Staio's of Florence, Oyl is sold by the Cantar, which is 2 ¾ Barrels Florence, and hath been found to render in Weight 180 pound English.</P>
<P>The Custom of this place and of the I∣sland in general, is for the most part 9 and 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon all Sollid goods, but Fish and other Edible Commodities pay 12 <HI>per cent.</HI> and all Commodities of Weight imported, whether they are sold or not sold; pay 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> at <HI>Messina,</HI> and remov∣ing from Ship to Ship, pays 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> and sometimes 3 ¼, all Merchandise conveyed out of the Island at the Port of <HI>Messina,</HI> pay 6 ⅓ <HI>per cent.</HI> unless when the fair is, and
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
then according to a Custom granted, some Commodities pay less then other some, as for instance, Silk pays but 3 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The Islands of <HI>Malta, Corsica,</HI> and <HI>Sardi∣nia,</HI> afford store of Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Honey, Wax, Oyls, Figs, Rasins, Wines, Honey, Allum, Box-Wood, Iron, Hides, Cheese, Cattle, and the like; but are not much Traded too. And therefore I shall forbear to describe them further.</P>
<P><HI>Majorica</HI> and <HI>Minorica,</HI> the former 300 Miles in circuit, and the latter 250 are Seated in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> 9 Miles distant from each other; and abound in Corn, Oyl, Wine, Fruits, Drugs, which are yearly lad∣ed for <HI>England</HI> and other Countries; but especially Oyl. Their Monies are for the most part those currant in <HI>Spain.</HI> Their Weights 2, <HI>viz.</HI> the Rotolo and Cantar, 100 of the first making the last called Bar∣baresco, which there is 117 pound making in <HI>London</HI> 110 pound, they have likewise another Cantar of 104 pound, called the Cantar of <HI>Majorica,</HI> they likewise sell some Commodities by the Cargo, as Pepper Gin∣ger, Cinnamond, Nutmegs, Rice, and the which Cargo is 3 Cargo's, of 104 pound. The Measure of Length is the Cane, found to make 67 in 68 <HI>London</HI> Inches. The The Oyl Measure is the Quartano, 12 of
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>
which make the Odor, and 212 that of 126 Gallons which is a Tun of Oyl, according to <HI>London</HI> Gauge, and the Customs and o∣ther charges are reckoned to 2 pound 7 Shillings 6 Pence <HI>per</HI> Tun.</P>
<P>In this Sea are the Islands of <HI>Javisa,</HI> afford∣ing store of Salt, as also the Isles <HI>Lipara Promentary, Pantcleria, Caprea, Ischia, Pro∣gitue, Elba, Gages</HI> or <HI>Cales,</HI> with some o∣thers of smaller note, affording Cattle, Corn, Olive, Oyl, Wine, Gapars, Cave∣re, Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Fish, and the like; most of them in the possession of the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> And thus leaving the <HI>Me∣deterranian,</HI> I shall enter the North Oce∣an, to take a View of the Islands not as yet mentioned in this Treatise.</P>

of the Mountains of Ice that Float there∣in, and for that none ever yet passed o∣ver Land to the extent of that dismal Coun∣try; where from the 14 of <HI>October</HI> to the 12 of <HI>February</HI> no Sun appears, but the Moon shines as in <HI>England,</HI> and for 3 Months and a half, in Summer time they have no Night, as for humane Inhabitants there are none; yet the Woods and Caves a∣bound with Bears, Foxes, and Dear, and the Voyages the English make thither, are upon the account of the Whale Fishery, Whales in abundance being found in those deep Seas, the Ships seting out in <HI>May,</HI> and Arriving in <HI>June</HI> at <HI>Green-Harbour</HI> and <HI>Bell-Sound.</HI> They set up their Caldrons Pres∣ses and other necessaries, then put again to Sea, and when they perceive the Whales coming by the rising of the Water, they send out Skiffs with Hasping-Irons and Ca∣bles; when the men therein taking their advantage strike the Whales, who no sooner find themselves wounded but Plunge to the Bottom, those in the Boat giving them Rope, and by their Sinking know where they will rise; and give notice to the Ships who stand off for fear of being overset, when they rise with horrible Bellowing, they make towards the Shore spouting Blood and Water; the Reason of their so doing
<PB N="186" REF="291"/>
is to indeavour the rubing out of the I∣rons upon the Sands, but in vain for then by force of Cables they draw them on shoar, and their cut out their Pulps, of which they make the Oyl, and their Fins, of which our Whalebone is made by drying and prepar∣ing; so that sometimes one Whale is found to yield 3 Tuns of Oyl, and half a Tun Weight of Whalebone. Here it was that several Persons were left a whole Winter (the Ship going away during their Hunting up in the Country) and lived in a Hutt upon Bears-Flesh, Venison, Wild-Foxes, Birds, and the Greens or pressings of the Whales, till next year the Ships came a∣gain, and fetched them off. For 7 Months, all the Seas are Frozen over, and the Country is covered with Mountains of Snow.</P>
<P>In this Tract is <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> where the Pole is elevated 76 degrees, and whither the <HI>Dutch</HI> yearly resort to Fish for Whales, and such other Fish as yield matter for Oyl. It abounds in Dear, Wild-Foxes, and the like as <HI>Greenland</HI>; and in it likewise not long since several <HI>Dutchmen</HI> were forced to Winter, &amp; suffered great Extremity by Rea∣son of the excessive cold. There are found likewise Sr. <HI>Hugh Willoughby</HI>'s Island, called Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Foreland; likewise <HI>Freez∣land,
<PB N="287" REF="291"/>
Iceland</HI> and others of lesser note, but by Reason of the excessive cold, few of them are Inhabited, and the chief Com∣modities they yield are Ling, Cod, and Fish Oyls.</P>
<P>And thus according to my promise hav∣ing taken Survey of the Trade of all the known part of the <HI>Ʋniverse,</HI> as near as can be gathered from long experience and cre∣dible Authority, I shall return with Joy to Tread my Native Soil, and there take a View of what yet remains in relation to Trade and Commerce. And first I shall be∣gin with Exchanges, that one necessary part of all Navigational and Inland Com∣merce.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCVII. A View of the Practice of Exchanges in Ge∣neral, and the advantage accruing there∣by.</HEAD>
<P>THat Exchanges are a Principal part of Merchandise, it is most certain, and has been so found for 200 Years p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, tho not brought to perfection till of late Days. The places most apt for Exchanges are
<PB N="288" REF="292"/>
those where many Merchants of divers Nations reside; and have frequent meetings in relation to Trade, and Prizes of Com∣modities, whose returns are Subject to great Exchanges, which are ever advantageous to the place where they are Practised. Now some places there are that have Exchanges in themselves, yet are compelled to de∣pend upon other places; having only cer∣tain times or Fairs appointed by the Cu∣stom of Exchangers, in which, or to which Bills of Exchange are either expired, re∣newed, or dated, one of which is <HI>Placentia</HI>; and indeed all Towns in Countries where there is more then one Exchange establish∣ed, the <HI>Metropolis</HI> or Principal Exchange gives Rules, and Rates to the rest; provid∣ed the Coyns be of equal value and good∣ness, nor indeed tho many places have at∣tributed the name of Exchanges, yet that Exchange remains not so much in <HI>Esse</HI> as in the will of the Merchants, Bankers, and Exchan∣gers, in whose Power it is to assign the place as they think convenient; and for the most part pitch upon Principal places, where their Bills are sure to have a quick dispatch. Now there are several Cities that exchange in one and the same Monies, Coyns, and Denomination; as <HI>Naples, Lechie, Bar∣ry,</HI> the two latter included in the former,
<PB N="289" REF="292"/>
<HI>Palermo,</HI> and <HI>Messina,</HI> comprehended in <HI>Si∣cilia; Valentia, Saragosa,</HI> and <HI>Barselona</HI> in <HI>Cattalonia; Sevil, Alcala,</HI> and <HI>Medina-del-Campo</HI> in <HI>Castilia; Frankford, Colona, Norem∣burg,</HI> and <HI>Augusta</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> with many other of less note. But exchange now from a Plain and easie Method is reduced to so many mysterious Points, that it is extraor∣dinary difficult to understand it aright in all places, therefore I shall only lay down such Particulars as chiefly concern English Merchants; and are conducing to the Trade of the Brittish Empire. The first thing then that is to be observed, is the true value of the Coyn of the City, or Port where you make your exchange, which is not to be taken according to the value of the Coyn as it is currant, but according to its Weight and fineness, and so the return may be proportionable; but if Bills are drawn to pay a Merchant residing in any place where the Coyn is currant, and he dispo∣ses of it for Commodities of the Growth, or Manufacture of the Country, then it matters not how the Coyn has been in∣haunced above its true value, by Reason it is currant, tho perhaps should the Coyn be carryed into an other Kingdom, it might redound to the loss of the receiver a third part; and this equallizing Coyns of divers
<PB N="290" REF="293"/>
Nations by Ballance I called a Par, by which all Coyns of Silver or Gold espe∣cially, are reduced to an equal value; as for example, <HI>Placentia</HI> exchanges with <HI>Lon∣don</HI> one Crown of currant money there for 1 Shilling 6 pence ½ <HI>ob.</HI> Sterling, <HI>Lyons</HI> the Crown currant for 2 Shillings 8 pence Sterling, <HI>Rome</HI> exchanges her Ducat 87 ½ pence Sterling, <HI>Genoa</HI> her Crown of Gold at 83 pence Sterling, <HI>Millain</HI> her Crown of Gold 84 pence ½ <HI>ob.</HI> Sterling, <HI>Venice</HI> her Ducat at 60 pence Sterling, <HI>Florence</HI> her Crown at 80 pence, <HI>Luca</HI> her Ducat at 67 pence Sterling, <HI>Naples</HI> her Ducat at 66 ½ pence Sterling, <HI>Lechy</HI> her Ducat at 6 pence Sterling, <HI>Bary</HI> her Ducat at 62 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Palermo</HI> her Ducat at 78 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Messina</HI> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Valentia</HI> her Ducat at 72 ½ pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Saragosa</HI> her Ducat at 73 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Barsalonia</HI> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Sevil</HI> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Lisbon</HI> her Ducat at 69 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Bolonia</HI> her Ducat at 67 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Bergamo</HI> her Ducaton at 67 pence Ster∣ling, <HI>Frankfort, Noremburg, Augusta,</HI> and <HI>Viena</HI> (in all which Cities one and the same Coyn is currant) Exchange their Florin at 50 pence Sterling; all these Cities and Towns <HI>London</HI> exchanges within broken numbers
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
(that is by pence) at the rates aforesaid, and so Multiplies into greater Summs as occasion requires, but with <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Collen, Amsterdam, &amp;c,</HI> in whole number, as one pound Sterling for 34 ½ Flemish Shillings, and proportionable for greater Summs.</P>
<P>Again in <HI>London</HI> and throughout all <HI>Eng∣land</HI> Exchangers and Merchants keep their Accounts in Pounds, Shillings, Pence, and cast them up as is done in other places, by Solds, Livers, and Denire, <HI>viz.</HI> 12 pence to the Shilling, and 20 Shillings to the pound, and are found to exchange with <HI>Transmarine</HI> Cities thus, <HI>viz.</HI> to allow 64 pence Sterling, for the Crown of <HI>Placentia</HI> 64 pence Sterling, for the Crown of <HI>Ly∣ons</HI> 66 pence Sterling, for the Ducat of <HI>Rome</HI> 65 pence, for the Crown of Gold of <HI>Genoa</HI> 64 2/4 pence, for the Crown of Gold of <HI>Millain</HI> 50 pence, for the Ducat in <HI>Ban∣co</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> 61 pence, for the Crown of <HI>Florence</HI> 53 ½ pence, for the Ducaton of <HI>Luca</HI> 50 pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Naples</HI> 50 ½ pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Lechy</HI> 51 pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Bary</HI> 57 ½, for the Du∣cat of <HI>Palermo</HI> 56 ½, for which Ducat of <HI>Messina</HI> one pound Sterling, for 34 ½ Shil∣lings Flemish, with <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Collon</HI> 57 ½ pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Valentia</HI> 59
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Saragosa</HI> 64 pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Barselona</HI> 59 ½ pence, for the Florin of <HI>Frankford</HI> 52 pence, for the Ducaton of <HI>Bergamo</HI> 53 ⅓, for the Ducaton of <HI>Bolonia</HI> 53 ½ pence, and for the Ducat of <HI>Lisbon</HI> 53 ½. And thus the currant Ex∣change is setled, and continues unless in times of War, when Princes to Inrich their Cof∣fers, make an Inhaunsment upon the cur∣rant Coyns in their respective Domini∣ons, and at other times when the Banker or Exchanger takes the advantage of the Par∣ties necessity, upon whose Accounts the ex∣change is to be made.</P>
<P>The Terms of paying Bills of exchange in <HI>London</HI> with other Cities, are commonly these. To <HI>Venice</HI> at 3 Months after date, and so upon return to <HI>Antwerp</HI> at one Month after date; and so back to <HI>Genoa</HI> at 3 Months, and so back to <HI>Lyons</HI> for the Fair, and so from Fair to Fair as the Custom of that City is; to <HI>Pisa</HI> at 3 Months after date, and so back to <HI>Placentia,</HI> from Fair to Fair according to the Custom of the place; to <HI>Florence</HI> at 3 Months after date, &amp; so upon return to <HI>Rou∣en</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> at one Month after date, and so back; and these Bills are currant money, insomuch that many Millions are pay'd by Bills without telling any money, Merchants passing the Bills to one another by assign∣ment
<PB N="289" REF="294" MS="y"/>
as currant Coyns, of which Bills their Presentations, Intimations, Accepta∣tions, Protests, and Returns, I shall in the following Chapter, expose to the View of the Reader.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCVIII. A Discourse of the Forms of Bills of Exchange, how they ought to be drawn, presented, payed or protested in default; with a caution against delays, and the danger thereof, according to the Law and Custom of Merchants.</HEAD>
<P>A Bill of Exchange in it self is held so excellent a speciallity, and carries with it not only as it were a command∣ing Power to pay; but is for the most part ob∣served and satisfyed with all due regard, tho drawn by a Servant upon his Master, such a high esteem being ever had for the quality thereof, that nothing in the way of Trade can be more, for upon it depends the reputation of the Drawer &amp; Accepter: So that those who fail in the payment of accepted Bills, wound their credit by suffering Pro∣test to be made, which soon gets Wind
<PB N="294" REF="295"/>
and spreads wide upon the Exchange, and not only so but obliges the Acceptor to pay the char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the Protestant return, and cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s into question the credit of the draw∣er.</P>
<P>Of bills of exchange there are two sorts, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Inland, <HI>viz.</HI> the former drawn upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Merchant Banker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Liv∣ing beyond the Seas, the second upon a Merchant Banker or other Person living in the same Country, tho distant from the place where the Bill is drawn; as to make a Bill payable at <HI>London,</HI> for money taken up at <HI>Bristol</HI>; each having equal force ought to have due observance alike.</P>
<P>As to an Exchange, four, three or two Persons may make it thus, 2 at the place where the money is taken up, and 2 at the place were it is payable, first the deliverer, secondly the taket, thirdly the Person that is to take the money, and fourthly the party upon whom the Bill is drawn. 3 Persons thus, first the taker, secondly the deliverer, and thirdly the Person on whom the Bill is drawn.</P>
<P>2 Persons, first the Drawer, and second∣ly the Party on whom it is drawn, the for∣mer making his Bill payable to himself or order, which may of Exchange is very advantageous as well to Merchants as other Traders.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="295"/>There is another sort of Exchange cal∣led a dry exchange, which is practised thus, if a Person have occasion for 100 pound, he goes to a Banker who takes a Bill of Exchange of him to be payed at <HI>Lyons,</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI> at double or treble Usance; tho the Drawer has no Correspondence in either of the Cities, then the Bill growing due, the Banker receives a Protest for non-pay∣ment, upon which the Drawer in <HI>London</HI> must pay the money with costs, which is a Trick to evade the Statute against Extor∣tion.</P>
<P>There is likewise a feigned Exchange which is thus, the Banker agrees to lend me money upon Bill of exchange payable at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> yet between our selves it is payable here, which if I pay at the time appointed, I receive my discharge accord∣ing to agreement, but if I make default, then the Banker Writes to his Friend at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who sends him a Bill of Ex∣change for the like Summ owing him here, so that I who borrowed the money, am obliged to pay the cost of the exchanges and other charges.</P>
<P>Another Exchange there is called the petty Exchanges as thus, to exchange 20 Shilling in Silver, for 21 Shillings in Brass or Copper, which is the most inconside∣rable.

And thus much for the several sorts of Exchangs.</P>

<DIV2 N="100" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="300" REF="298"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XCX. Several useful observations to be carefully noted, in the Management of Bills of Ex∣change.</HEAD>
<P>OBserve to note in your Book the Name of the place of aboad of the Person who presents the Bill, keep Cop∣pies of the Bills sent to get accepted, make the direction of Bills on the inside, and all for the Reasons following.</P>
<P>First by knowing the place of Aboad of him that presented the first Bill, he may be the better excused, if he except against the second Bill from the same Hand, before the first be satisfyed.</P>
<P>Secondly by taking Copies of Bills sent to get acceptance, you may know how Ex∣changes go in all places, and at the same time to know without any great trouble, on whom you are to call for your money, and what Day.</P>
<P>Thirdly to make the direction of Bills on the inside, will give larger Scope to Write this Assignment on the back side.</P>
<P N="4">4ly. Every Person who receives a Bill to get it accepted, whether for himself or
<PB N="301" REF="298"/>
another must, tho some hold the contra∣ry, present the said Bill in due time; that the Person who is to accept it, may order his affairs accordingly, and not be surpriz∣ed with the presentation of a Bill, just when it becomes due.</P>
<P N="5">5ly. If a Bill be protested after accep∣tance, it does not clear the party who was faulty in non-payment, but renders him lyable to pay the charges; and exposes him to an Action at Law, to which before he was not lyable, nor is the Drawer cleared, but obliged to see the Bill satis∣fyed.</P>
<P N="6">6ly. Times of payment are according to the distance or Custom of the places, where the Bills are drawn, &amp; were payable, as has before been briefly touched, as from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Antwerp, Midelborrough, Rotterdam, Lysle, Rouen</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> at a Months Usance.</P>
<P N="7">7ly It is dangerous to draw a Bill payable to the bearer, by Reason if a Bill should happen to be lost, any Person might bring it for acceptance or payment, therefore the safest way is to make it payable to a particular man, or his order; for otherwise if it should be payed to the wrong party, and the Bill received, he on whom it is drawn, is not lyable to pay it again unless a Fraud be proved.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="302" REF="299"/>81y. A Bill of Exchange is held so Au∣thentick, that it requires no witness, nor is it requisite that any Person unless the Per∣son that receives it be present at the Writ∣ing thereof, or that any one be present, when the party who accepts it under-writes his name, for if any Person either Draw∣er or Subscriber should deny his Hand, it may be easiely proved by comparing his Letter or Books of Account, and if that be proved his credit is inevitably ruined.</P>
<P N="9">9ly. If you receive an Outland Bill pre∣sent it presently, and if it be refused pro∣test without delay, and send it back to the Drawer with Protest, which will be for the advantage of both. Twenty four Hours is the longest time, that you are obliged to give any Merchant to consider whether he will or not, and after that, it is at your pleasure whether you will protest or give longer time, and after protest advice ought to be given to the Drawer by the first Post.</P>
<P N="10">10. If a Bill be drawn on two Persons, and not to them or either of them, but joyntly, yet if one do accept it and the other refuse it the Bill ought to be pro∣tested.</P>
<P N="11">11. If a Bill be presented to any Per∣son, and he by word of mouth, desires
<PB N="303" REF="299"/>
it may be left in his Hands, and does Ver∣bally accept it, altho he afterwards refuse to Subscribe it, yet such an acceptance is valid, and he may be Sued upon due Protest, tho Protest must not be made till the money becomes due.</P>
<P N="12">12. If a man accept a Bill for part and not for the whole, alledging he has no more in his Hands; the Person to whom the money is payable, may receive the part and give an acquittance for so much as he receives, but must enter Pro∣test for non-payment of the rest, and send it away as soon as the party refuses to ac∣cept for the whole.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Drawer is Master of the Bill till it becomes due, and may Countermand it by sending an Express to the party, who has accepted it not to pay it without fur∣ther order, which order must be made, and passed before a publick Notary, and noti∣fyed to the party that hath accepted the Bill, but if the money be pay'd it is past re∣covery.</P>
<P N="14">14. A Bill of Exchange may be pay'd at Usance single, double or treble, that is length of time according to the quality of the Person; the occasion or difficulty of passage by Reason of different Seasons, but general Usance is accounted a Month from
<PB N="304" REF="300"/>
the Date of the Bill, each month tho dif∣ferent in number of Days being accounted, the Month required on that occasion.</P>
<P N="15">15. A Bill payable at Days sight, is from the Day after it is accepted, else Pro∣test ought to be made. If an accepted Bill be lost, yet it will not Bar the payment, but may be Sued for as if the Bill were in be∣ing, nor is the party who accepted it bound to pay a second Bill, before the first be dis∣charged, unless the second Bill be directed to the party who lost the Former in lieu thereof.</P>
<P N="16">16. When a Bill is accepted, there is no revoking it, but it must be either payed or Protested; tho sometimes it hap∣pens that the Acceptor and the Party to whom the Bill is payable, do conclude upon longer time then the Bill specifies, or to take it by Parcels; yet if he doubt the honesty of the Acceptor, the Presentor must nowithstanding make Protest, or the Acceptor may refuse further payment, and yet not lye lyable to be Sued.</P>
<P N="17">17. If a Bill be directed to a party, and he be out of Town, not leaving any Warrant of Attorney, to impower his Wife or Servants to accept it; and another Mer∣chant to support the Drawers credit, will accept and pay it, yet Protest must be made against the party on whom it was drawn for non-acceptance.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="305" REF="300"/>18. In some cases half Usance is allow∣ed, especially in Inland Bills, which is ac∣counted 15 Days.</P>
<P>Note that all Bills must be Protested 3 Days after they become due, it being dangerous to exceed that time, altho one of the Days happened on a Sunday, yet tho the 3 Days are expired, 'tis not at all unne∣cessary to Protest.</P>
<P N="19">19. Bills payable at a fixed Day, are not meant one, and the same Day if they come from any place where the new Style is practised, because the old and new ad∣mits of ten Days difference. As for Example, if a Bill be dated new Style payable on the 10 of <HI>March,</HI> it is not payable till the 10 of <HI>March</HI> old Style, which is the 20th. of <HI>March</HI> new Style.</P>
<P N="20">20. A Wife or a Servant cannot accept a Bill of Exchange, unless the Husband or Master impower them by a Warrant of At∣torney so to do, or that formerly they have accepted Bills with his good liking, and by him discharged.</P>
<P N="21">21. If a party on whom a Bill is drawn, live at a distant City or place of Exchange, from him that is to receive the money, he must go himself or send the Bill down to some Friend to get it accepted, which if not accepted, Protest must be entered, if it
<PB N="306" REF="301"/>
be a place of Exchange, or by the help of a Letter of such refusal, from the Friend who endeavoured to get it accepted, Protest may be made at <HI>London,</HI> tho the party live at <HI>Southampton,</HI> but if accepted and your Bill returned when it becomes due, if it be made payable at <HI>london,</HI> you must expect there your money, or enter Protest for non-payment.</P>
<P N="22">22. If a Merchant that accepted a Bill prove non-Solvent, and absent himself from the Exchange; you must before the Bill be due, cause demand to be made by a Notary for better Security, and in default thereof cause Protest to be made, and send away the Pro∣test by the next Post to the Drawer of the Bill, who must defray the charges of such Protest, and all Protests must be made be∣tween Sun and Sun, that is, between Sun Rising and Sun Setting; other Hours being accounted unseasonable, and held amongst Merchants Illegal.</P>
<P N="23">23. If a Protest be returned to the Drawer or Indorser, he must get an able man to under-write the Protest, and ob∣lige himself to make speedy payment with Costs and Rechange, but if the Protest be returned for want of payment, and you have had Security already upon the Protest for non-acceptance or want of better Se∣curity, then upon receipt of your Protest
<PB N="307" REF="301"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or non-payment, you may only acquaint the Drawer or party that took up the money, and tarry out the proportion of time, at which the Bill was made payable, to be accounted from the time it fell due, before you demand your Principal money, with the Rechange and charges of the par∣ty who drew the Bill or his Security, which according to the Law of Merchants, they are bound to satisfy either joyntly or severally.</P>
<P N="24">24. When you have an accepted Bill protested for want of payment, keep the Bill, but send away the Protest, by which means the money is recoverable of the Draw∣er.</P>
<P N="25">25. If a Bill be delivered to a party to be accepted, and yet by the carelesness or otherwise of the party that received it in order to accept be Lost, then must he who brought it demand a note under the Hand and Seal of the Merchant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who received the Bill for the payment of the money, at the Day specifyed in the Bill, upon a second Bill if it come to hand, or if not upon the note it self, and if such note be refused to be given, then the party who should receive the mo∣ney upon the lost Bill, must enter protest and send it away, and when the money be∣comes due upon the lost Bill, he must make
<PB N="308" REF="302"/>
demand of it, and for non-payment enter Protest a second time, and send it away, or if he have a note, yet if it be not payed at the time therein limited, he must Protest as upon a Bill of Exchange.</P>
<P N="26">26. If a Person send a Bill to a Friend of his to get it accepted, tho drawn upon no particular Person, but a Blanck left to put in the parties Name that will accept it, it is according to the Law of Merchants suffi∣cient.</P>
<P N="27">27. If a Bill be drawn by one Merchant upon another, upon the account of a third man; he upon whom it is drawn has liber∣ty to chuse whether he will accept it upon the account of the third Person, or on his account who drew it; but then he must go before a Publick Notary, and declare his intent, of which the Notary must make an Act indue Form to be sent away to the party whom it concerns; and he must also cause an Act to be made for payment there∣of when it becomes due, declaring that he will pay it for the Honour of the Drawer, but upon no other account then is the Draw∣er accountable to him for the Summ specifyed in the Bill.</P>
<P N="28">28. If a Bill be drawn upon a Merchant, who after acceptance for want of money, or otherwise fails to pay it when due, another
<PB N="309" REF="302"/>
Merchant for the Honour of the Drawer may pay the Bill, yet Protest must be made against him that made default, and sent a∣way, and the safest way in that case is to have the receipt for discharge of the Bill Writ∣ten under the Protest, and to keep the ac∣cepted Bill as an Evidence against him who failed in the payment thereof.</P>
<P N="29">29. If a party dye between the time of acceptance, and the time money becomes due upon a Bill, you must go to the place of his last aboad, when the money becomes due, and demand it of the Executors, and if payment be refused, you must Protest as you would have done if the party were living.</P>
<P N="30">30. If the party dye to whom a Bill is payable before it become due, altho the Will be not proved, nor Letters of Administra∣tion taken out, yet you must demand the money when due, offering at the same time Security to save the Payer harmless from the Executors or Administrators, and if upon such offer payment is refused, you must Protest for non-payment.</P>
<P N="31">31. If a Bill be drawn upon a Person, and upon inquiry no such Person can be found, you must have your Bill Protested in due Form.</P>
<P N="32">32. If when you go to get your Bill

<PB N="310" REF="304"/>
accepted, no Person can accept it be at home, and that at 2 or 3 goings, you must enter Protest, either for non-acceptance or non-payment; either at his dwelling House or Lodging in his absence, which accord∣ing to the Law of the Merchants is suffici∣ent, for he ought at Seasonable times to attend his own business, for there is no avoiding Protest, whether absent or pre∣sent.</P>
<P N="33">33. If the Figures and words at Length in a Bill of Exchange disagree, then you ought to be guided by the words at Length and not by the Figures.</P>
<P N="34">34. If a Name be mended or words in∣terlined, and the Bill be accepted, tho it is a foul fault in the Drawer, yet it is not an excuse sufficient for the Acceptor to refuse payment, but if the party who accepted alledge that it has been mended, or interlined since he accepted, he must prove it, the which if he do he may re∣fuse payment, till a second Bill comes to Hand.</P>
<P N="35">35. If a Bill be made payable Positive∣ly to a Person by name, then an Assignment will not be available; for it must be the very man spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fyed to whom the Bill must be pay'd, lest by paying to a wrong party, you are obliged to pay it again in your own wrong.</P>
<P N="36"><PB N="311" REF="304"/>36. If a Bill come to any party to get it accepted, and by an oversight it be not di∣rected to any Person by name, yet in the Letter of credit, the party to whom it was intended be mentioned; then must it be presented in order to its being accepted, and if the party for want of his name on the Bill refuse to accept it, then Protest must be made for the Drawers Omission; and he is lyable to pay the charges.</P>
<P N="37">37. If a Bill be accepted, and protested for non-payment, yet if the Drawer do satisfy the contents of the Bill, he that ac∣cepted the Bill is discharged, as to the party to whom the Bill was due, but must nevertheless stand ingaged to the Drawer; and if a Bill be by one Person Assigned over to another, if the first Person be sa∣tisfyed, the Bill becomes useless, nor can it by Law be recovered.</P>
<P>And thus much for Bills of Exchange, and now I shall only proceed, to give the Reader an insight into the nature of Letters of Credence, and so conclude this one great and necessary part of Merchants affaires.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXI. Of Letters of credit, and to what intent they are drawn.</HEAD>
<P>THere are divers sorts of Letters, that pass between Merchants and Merchants, or Merchants and their Factors. As Letters of Commission for buying and selling, Let∣ters of advice, Letters of Fraight, and Let∣ters of Credit; the latter of which are properly such as are Written to furnish mo∣nies by Exchange, upon the credit of him that Writes them, so that by virtue of the Letter or Letters so Written, the Mer∣chant or Banker that Writes the Letter or Letters, are bound as firmly, as if they had given Bond to satisfy by Bill of Ex∣change; or otherwise any Summ or Summs of money, taken upon them by those Per∣sons specifyed therein. And these Letters are two sorts, the one General and the o∣ther special.</P>
<P>The first is when I Write my open Let∣ter to all Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who shall Furnish such and such Persons upon my Letter of credit, wherein I do bind my self, that what Monies shall be delivered unto such and such
<PB N="313" REF="305"/>
parties therein specifyed, within the time limited at such and such rates, or as the Exchange is currant; I will repay by Bills of Exchange or otherwise: and if any one should refuse to pay Bills for monies receiv∣ed upon his Letters of credit, yet those Letters being produced, and proved to be his, are as binding as Hand and Seal, and stand as good in Law.</P>
<P>The special Letter of credit, is directed to a peculiar Person, and is of force equal with the former; as for the Forms of the General Letters of credit, they are vari∣ous and sutable to the occasion of the Wri∣ter, but the form of a special or particular Letter of credit may run thus.

into their consideration the condition of Merchants Trading into Forrain parts, that they were frequently Robbed, and spoiled by Pirates and Picaroons, and Ships of War of divers Nations, under pretence of Letters of Reprizal. They the better to prevent such outrages, thought it con∣venient to Grant his Majesty a Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, payable upon all Merchandise imported or exported, unless Herrings and some other Fish therein ex∣cepted. The better to inable his Majesty to maintain at Sea several Ships of War, for the securing and convoying Merchants Ships to and from the divers Ports and Places, whither they are bound or have a∣ny Commerce, and to over-awe and keep un∣der such Pirates and others, as would o∣therwise grow numerous, and obstruct all Naval Commerce, the Principal Commo∣dities paying Tonnage and Poundage, com∣monly called Customs. I shall here recite, and for the rest, refer the Reader to the Book of Rates, rated by the advice and approbation of most of the eminent Mer∣chants of <HI>England</HI>; and since published and confirmed by Parliament.</P>
<P>As for Tonnage every Tun of Wine of the Growth of the French King or Crow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>France,</HI> that shall come into the Port of
<PB N="316" REF="307"/>
<HI>London</HI> or the Members thereof by way of Merchandise; being the proper Goods of a natural Born Subject, pays eight pounds 10 Shillings the Tun; or being the proper Goods of an Alien or Stranger, it pays 10 pound, and so lesser or greater quantities proportionably; but into any other Port of <HI>England,</HI> the Native pays 20 Shillings less, and the Stranger the like <HI>per</HI> Tun.</P>
<P>Muscadels, Malmasies, Cutes, Tents, A∣licans, Bastards Sacks, Canaries, Mallagoes, Maderoes, and other Wines; of the Growth of Levant, <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> or any of the Islands or Dominions belonging to them, or any of them which shall be brought in∣to the Port of <HI>London,</HI> as Merchandise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by a Native, shall pay the Summ of 7 pound 10 Shillings the Tun, a Stranger nine pound, and into any other of his Majesties Ports 20 Shillings less, the Pipe or Butt, by either Native or Alien, for Rhenish Wine of the Growth of <HI>Germany</HI>; also note that always the Stranger pays 30 Shillings in the Tun more then the Native is to pay, the Ancient duty of Butlerage which is 2 Shillings in the Tun; and in these Duties or Customs is included, the Duty formerly of 20 Shil∣lings <HI>per</HI> Tun, upon all Wines of the Growth of the Levant, by Strangers known by the name of <HI>Southampton</HI> Duties, for which sort
<PB N="317" REF="307"/>
of Wines the Stranger is to pay to the use of the Town of <HI>Southampton,</HI> 10 Shillings for every Butt or Pipe, as for prize Wines they pay no Customs.</P>
<P>Note that if any Wines be imported, and within a twelve month exported; they are not lyable to pay the Additional Duty, or if it be pay'd it is to be returned, <HI>viz.</HI> 4 pound every Tun of French Wine, and every Tun of Wine of the Growth of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> or <HI>Madera,</HI> 3 pound brought into the Port of <HI>London,</HI> as in Statute 12 of <HI>Car.</HI> 2, it more at large appears.</P>
<P>And all such Wines as are Landed at a∣ny of the out-Ports, and afterwards brought into the Port of <HI>London</HI> by a certificate, shall pay so much more Custom as was pay'd short of the Duty in the Port of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P>For every Tun of Beer to be exported in Ships, English built, must be pay'd 2 Shil∣lings, and for every Tun exported in any other Ship 6 Shillings. If at any time there shall chance Goods to be exported or im∣ported, not mentioned in the Book of Rates, agreed on by the commons, Intitled the rates of Merchandise, and that by such omission there is no set value on them, then it shall be Lawful for the Customer in being to levy twelve pence in the pound,
<PB N="318" REF="308"/>
upon such Goods according to the true va∣lue: which value is to be given by the Mer∣chant or owner upon Oath, before the Cu∣stomer, Collector, Comptroller, Surveyer, or any two of them.</P>
<P>If Vineger, Perry, Rape, Cider, or Ci∣der-Eager, be imported by a Native from Forrain Parts, he pays 6 pound 10 Shil∣lings the Tun, but by an Alien only 6 pound, but if they shall again export any such Liquids, then 3 pound 10 Shillings the Tun shall be repayed to the Native, and 4 pound 15 Shillings to the Alien. There is likewise imposed on Wines, Vine∣ager, Cider and Beer 10 Shillings <HI>per</HI> Tun, and on Brandy and Strong-Water 20 Shil∣lings <HI>per</HI> Tun. For Coynage-Duty, and the money that arises by this Duty, is to be payed at the Custom-House, to the Collectors and other Officers, to be by them kept a∣part from other monies; and payed quar∣terly into the Exchequer without Salary or Fee, and if neglect be made in the pay∣ment of this Duty, the Goods are Forfei∣table; but note if that within a twelve-month, they are Transported, then the mo∣ney so pay'd is to be returned according to Statute the 18 of <HI>Car.</HI> 2.

<HEAD>CHAP. CXIII. A Survey of the Custom commonly called Poundage, according to the Book of Rates, and such other Customs and Priviledg∣es, as are for the profit of the Mer∣chant.</HEAD>
<P>POundage is a Custom Established by Act of Parliament made in the 12 of his now Majesty, whereby the Book of Rate called the Rates of Merchandise, is approved and confirmed, that is a Subsidy granted to his Majesty of the 20 part of all Goods im∣ported or exported, <HI>viz.</HI> 1 Shilling in the pound, according as they are Rated in the said Book, and for Goods not found Rat∣ed
<PB N="320" REF="309"/>
in the aforesaid Book, according to the value Sworn to by the Merchant, as it is mentioned in the foregoing Chapter. As likewise a Subsidy of Woollen Cloaths or old Drapery; agreed on by the Commons-House in Parliament, assembled and Signed by the Hand of their Speaker, an account of which take as followeth.</P>
<P>Every Native shall pay for each short Cloath containing in Length not above 28 Yards, and in Weight not exceeding 64 pound, White or Coloured, by him to be Shipped or carryed out of the Kingdom, 3 Shillings 4 pence, being after the Rate of 2 Farthings ½ Farthing the pound Weight, and after the same Rate for all other sorts of Cloath of greater Length and Weight, not allowing above 28 Yards, and 60 pound to a short Cloath, <HI>viz.</HI> for every pound Weight over and above 64. pound 2 Far∣things and ½ Farthings, and for all other lesser Cloaths to be allowed to the short Cloath; but note if a Stranger do export any short Cloath containing 28 Yards, and in Weight not exceeding 64 pound, either White or Coloured, he shall pay 6 Shillings 8 pence, besides the old Duty of one Shilling 2 pence, and after the same Rate for all short Cloaths, and Cloaths of greater Length and Weight; for a de∣scription
<PB N="321" REF="309"/>
of the several sorts of which, I refer you to my Observations upon Woolen Manufactory, in the 11 and 12 Chapters of this Treatise.</P>
<P>Salt out of <HI>Scotland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> pays a ½ penny the Gallon, all Logwood imported pays 5 pound the Tun.</P>
<P>The Parliament taking care that Ships of force should be imployed by Merchants, have imposed on all Merchandise imported or exported, from and to the <HI>Mediterra∣nean</HI> Sea beyond <HI>Malaga,</HI> in any Ship not having 2 Decks and 16 Guns, allowing two men to each Gun, for such default one <HI>per cent.</HI> on all Merchandise that contrary to the express words of the Act, shall be import∣ed or exported, Ships laden or half laden with Fish only excepted.</P>
<P>There are likewise divers Duties paya∣ble Aliens for Goods imported in Aliens Ships, commonly called Navigation Duties, by the Act of Navigation made in the 12 of <HI>Car.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>And note that in all cases where Petty Custom inwards is payable, it is understood of the fourth part of a Subsidy, according to the Book of Rates of 5 pound <HI>per cent.</HI> and is called <HI>Parva Customa,</HI> granted to King <HI>Edward</HI> the first; the Merchants Strangers agreeing to pay to him and his Heirs 3
<PB N="322" REF="310"/>
pence in the pound, for every pounds worth of Goods, imported or exported.</P>
<P>There is another Custom called the <HI>Ali∣ens</HI> Custom, for all Fish, Oyl, Blubber, Whale-Bone or Whale-Fins, not being caught in Vessels of which the English are Proprietors; they are to pay double Cu∣stom. There is likewise an Impost to be payed for several sorts of Salt-Fish or dry∣ed Fish, not imported in English Vessels be∣longing to English Proprietors, or not hav∣ing been taken in such, as appears at large in the Statute of the 15 of <HI>Car.</HI> 2, intitled an Act of Trade.</P>
<P>Likewise all sorts of Forrain Coyn, or Bullion of Gold or Silver, may be export∣ed without paying any Duty or Fee for the same, entry being first made at the Cu∣stom-House, as also Precious Stones and Pearls of all sorts.</P>
<P>Any Person may import from any part beyond the Sea in English Ships, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into <HI>England, Wales, Guernsey, Jersey, &amp;c.</HI> paying the Customs always, provided they before the lading thereof, give notice to the Commis∣sioners or Farmers of the Customs, how much they intend to lade, and the name of the Vessel in which they design to import it, and procure a Licence under their Hands,
<PB N="323" REF="310"/>
or any 3 of them, if Goods are Wreck∣ed and the Lord Seises them, yet they ought not to pay Custom, unless in some Extra∣ordinary cases. Upon the exporting and importing of most Commodities, Fees are claimed over and above Custom. In the Port of <HI>London,</HI> the Members and Creeks there∣unto belonging, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Officers of the Petty Custom outwards of the Subsidy outwards, Petty Customs inwards Subsidies inward, great Customs, Clarks Fees, in∣wards and outwards the Kings Waiters being 18 in number. The Register of the Kings Warrants. The Usher of the Custom-House. The Saugers of French Vessels chief Search∣er, and the Kings 5 under-Searchers in the Port of <HI>London,</HI> and his 2 Searchers in the Port of <HI>Graves-End,</HI> were likewise entered in a Table which was setled and allowed of by the Commons Assembled in Parliament, and signed by their Speaker; at which time the Question being put, that for all such Goods as payed not one pound Custom in∣wards or outwards, there should be but half Fees taken for Cocquets, Debentures, Warrants, Fransieres, Certificates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it was resolved Affirmatively.</P>
<P>Societies or Companies that Trade in one Joynt-Stock, and make but one Single-En∣tery, tho the Adventurers are many, yet
<PB N="324" REF="311"/>
the Fees do not hinder, but the Officers and Weighers may receive such Gratuities, as the Master or Merchants will allow them out of their free Will.</P>
<P>All Goods valued in the Book of Rates at 5 pounds, and paying Subsidy but 5 Shillings, or under, shall pay no Fees.</P>
<P>If any English Merchant shall Land Goods out of one Ship into another (altho the Receipt of the Subsidies be distributed into several Offices) yet he shall pay but for a Single-Entry.</P>
<P>The Goods appertaining to Partners, are to pass as if they appertained to one single Person. Fish taken by the English men in English Bottoms, whether inward or outward pay no Fees.</P>
<P>Post-Entries under 5 Shillings inward pass without Fees, but if above 5 Shillings and 40 Shillings, then pay 6 pence, but exceeding 40 Shillings then full Fees.</P>
<P>The Merchant for all Goods that are opened, and not entered above 10 Shillings Custom shall pay Fees; he shall likewise pay for weighing all Goods short entered above 20 Shillings Custom, but if duly entered, then he is to be at no charge.</P>
<P>Note that the Merchant is to be allow∣ed for Tare, <HI>viz.</HI> abated in the Customs; which Tare upon all Commodities to which
<PB N="325" REF="311"/>
it is allowable is setled by the Customers, and fixed in a Table not to be any ways altered, without the consent and appoint∣ment of the Commissioners-Farmers, such under-Officers as they shall impower, as the General Surveyers of the Ware-House, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus much shall Suffice as to Cu∣stoms and order of Fees upon the Subsidy of Poundage; untill I come to speak some∣what more of the Priviledges and Customs of the City of <HI>London</HI>; and now I shall proceed to give the Reader an insight into the nature of Policies of Assu∣rance, now greatly in Request amongst Mer∣chants.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="114" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CXIV. Of Policies of assurance, their Original, their Legality, Nature, Quality, and of the great Incouragement they give to Navi∣gation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MOst are of opinion that this way of insuring, was first invented by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> will have it that <HI>Clau∣dius Caesar</HI> was the first contriver thereof, and by that means so incouraged Merchants,
<PB N="326" REF="312"/>
that they ventured into the till then sup∣posed innavigable Seas; proposing to themselves that if they escaped with their Lives, tho both Ships and Goods were lost, they should not be much indammaged.</P>
<P>All assurances are either Publick or Pri∣vate, the first are those that are entered in the Office or Court of Assurance, for the Conveniency of Merchants kept upon the Royal Exchange in <HI>London</HI>; where any one may have knowledge of what <HI>Cargo</HI> is in∣sured and of the <HI>Premio.</HI> The last is in Pri∣vate between man and man, and not enter∣ed in the Office, and are of equal Validity at common Law, but by the Statute of the 43 of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> only those that are enter∣ed in the Court of Assurance can be tryed and determined there, the other being left to the common Law only. These Assuran∣ces are divers of sorts, some being made for places general, others certain; those upon certain places or Ports are made upon Goods laden, which if they miscarry before they are safely Landed at the place agreed on, the Insurer must make good as far as he has insured, but upon certain notice of their safe Arrival, he may demand the Premio a∣greed on, and the Policy is then void, and the like upon Goods inward bound, or ac∣cording as the Merchant and Insurer can a∣gree.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="312"/>A General Ansurance is when a Ship goes a Trading Voyage, taking in at one Port and vending at another; so that the Insurer is lyable to any damage she sustains till she returns in safety to the Port from whence She sets out, that is in her Cargo only, unless the Ship and her Appurtenances are insured, which are frequently included, tho then the Premio runs higher.</P>
<P>Goods sent by Land may likewise be in∣sured, tho that seldom happens; or if any Person fears being taken by the <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> he may insure his Person of a cer∣tain Premio, and then if he be taken, the insurer is obliged to Ransom him: that is, pay so much money as is insured, some∣times the <HI>Assurers</HI> insert in their Policies lost or not lost, that is, when Ships have been a long time abroad, and no advice of their being in any Port, but then the Premio runs high as 30, 40, and sometimes more <HI>per cent.</HI> for if the Ship be lost at the time the Poli∣cy is Subscribed, yet so much as is insured must be made good, but then it must be contrary to the knowledge of him that in∣sures, or otherwise it will be accounted a Fraud.</P>
<P>If any Person assures a Rotten Vessel for more then She is worth, and then going out of the Port or Harbour, She Privately
<PB N="328" REF="313"/>
causes to be Wrecked or Sunk, if it can be proved it is a Defraud, and he who Sub∣scribed the Policy, is not bound to make satisfaction, but it is observed of late that seldom any one Person will insure a whole Ship; but Subscribe 50 pound, 100 pound or more at a certain Premio, currant at the time of assuring; which when the adven∣ture is Born they receive; but if a loss hap∣pens, the Premio is deducted together with the usual Abatements; so that the insured seldom receives more then 80 pound in the 100 pound, and many now adays are so adventurous, that they will ensure against Heaven and Earth; Stress of Weather, Storms, Enemies, Pirates, Rovers, and all other Casualties. If a Merchant ensures a Ship, he only names in the Policy of such a Burthen, then if She be lost the Insurers are bound to make the Ship only good, and not the Wares: If the Wares be insured it matters not whether each particular is mentioned in the Policy, but in general up∣on the chief Commodities, and all other Commodities laden or to be laden for the ensured.</P>
<P>If a Ship be Ensured and take Fire 'ere She break Ground, the <HI>Assurers</HI> in such a case are not lyable to make Restitution, unless the words be in the Policy at such
<PB N="329" REF="313"/>
a Port, or from such a Port, unless She had first broken Ground, and had been forced back again by Storm.</P>
<P>If a Ship be Ensured and prove Leaky, and the Master for preservation of the Car∣go, lade it into another Ship, and that Ship be lost, the Ensurer is not bound to make the Cargo good, unless in the Policy it is mentioned, untill the Goods by the said Ship or any other should be safely Landed at such a place, naming it.</P>
<P>It is held that if a Person Ensure more Goods then he has on Board, and several Persons Subscribed the Policy, yet the first Subscribers are only bound to pay the loss if they miscarry, and those that Subscribed over and above the value of the Goods, remitting their Premio 10 Shillings <HI>per cent.</HI> reducted for their Subscriptions are discharged: If a Cargo be Ensured to such a Port there safely to be unladed, and her Cargo is sold on Board, the Property be∣ing altered, if the Ship afterwards miscarry, the Ensurer is not obliged to make it good, if the buyer agrees for the Fraight to be car∣ryed to any other Port.</P>
<P>If Goods be Ensured, and the Ensured contrary to the knowledge of the Ensurer, Lades prohibited Goods, by which the Ship may become forfeited, then the Ensurer
<PB N="330" REF="314"/>
is not lyable to make good the Cargo, unless after the lading of such Goods they are prohibited.</P>
<P>If any Goods be damaged in the Ship by neglect of the Master or Mariners, the Ensurer is not bound to make Satisfaction. And further 'tis always expedient to prevent differences that may arise between the En∣surer and the Ensured, that the Bills of lading consist of three parts, one to be sent over Sea, the other left with the Master, and the last with the Lader.</P>
<P>This Office or Court of assurance, was erected by the Statute of the 43 of <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> Chap. 12, whereby the Judges or Com∣missioners appointed to determine differen∣ces arising, were the Judges of the Court of Admiralty, the Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> two Doctors of the Civil Law, two Barristers, eight discreet Merchants or any five of them, and that they or the Major part, should have Power to hear, examine, order or decree all such causes in a Summary way, without pleading or expence, and to have Power to Summon Parties to Examine up∣on Oath, commit to Prison upon disobedi∣ence, or the like; but this way being found tedious, because so many parties as made a Court, were not at all times to be Conve∣ned, it was taken into consideration, and

<P>The Judgments are there given upon mature deliberation, by Persons well Skil∣led in Marine affairs; and if the Sentence be supposed unreasonable, then the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, may upon an appeal determine the same; tho no appeal from thence can lye before the whole mo∣ney is deposited, and the full cost payed to the appelled. So that it prevents the trouble of taking up the Party by Execu∣tion, against whom the Decree has passed, and a further advantage is, they may in this Court decree against 20 Ensurers at once, which at common Law must be Sued di∣stinctly, tho the Execution cannot lye a∣gainst Body and Goods, but against either as at Common Law.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXV. The Original of the word Bottomery, and the Signification thereof, together with the Commodity and Discommodity accruing thereby.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FOenus Nauticum</HI> or <HI>Bottomery,</HI> is by the <HI>Dutch</HI> called <HI>Bomery, Bodmery,</HI> or <HI>Boddemerii</HI>; from the Keel or Bottom of a Ship, the Part being taken for the Whole, and was called by the Ancient Britains <HI>Bodo</HI> or <HI>Bo∣dun,</HI> the bottom of a Ship, Signifying the bottom or the Cargo therein contained, the which as Land is mortgaged for certain Sums of Money taken up thereon, and is bound to satisfy the same at return, with such interest as is agreed on the Statute of usury, in that case being excluded by Rea∣son of the Hazard the Lender runs; for
<PB N="333" REF="315"/>
in many cases money is taken up thus. I lend 100 pound upon a Ship, to receive 150 if the Ship arrives safe at such a Port, but if She chance to Miscarry, my money is lost, and many times Masters of Ships could not set out, if they did not in this nature take up Monies; for which them∣selves, their Ship or Cargo become Pledges; but some Persons have taken hold of this occasion to Bar the Statute of usury: thus they get the Party to feign he has a Ship bound for <HI>Amsterdam</HI> or any such Port, making a special obligation to pay the mo∣ney again at so much <HI>per cent.</HI> at a reason∣able time Granted for the return of the Ship; and if She do not in that time return the money to be pay'd notwithstanding, but certain it is if a Person have 500 or 1000 pound lying by him, and knows of an ingenious Merchant or Master of a Ship, who is fitting out for a Voyage, and is Slen∣derly stocked, and he lends him this money to buy such Commodities as will vend in the places whither he is bound, running the Risque to have nothing, if the Ship miscarry, and 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> Interest, if She re∣turn safe, it is altogether as profitable for the merchant as Master; as to take up mo∣ney at Brokerage, and to Ensure his Ship or Cargo. And if the Merchant or Ma∣ster
<PB N="334" REF="316"/>
makes double return of the said mo∣ney he gets sufficiently, as well as the Venturer, and this cannot be accounted usury.</P>
<P>There is yet another way both profita∣ble and Honourable, as thus, suppose a Per∣son puts a stock into the Hands of a Com∣pany or Society, which is termed a per∣petual stock, the Principal being never to be recalled, tho it may be often sold for good advantage, but he that put it in or buys it receives still his dividend, which produces sometimes twenty and sometimes more <HI>per cent.</HI> and the Hazard only is if the proportion of the stock that goes out be lost, he must abate, un∣less by remitting the dividend he will keep up the stock. And 100 pound in the <HI>East-India</HI> Company has been of late sold at 180 or 190 pound.</P>

<P>IF there be several Partners, or Owners of a Vessel, and one refuses to Furnish her out, according to his proportion, or to suffer her to go the Voyage intended by the other, he must sell his part, the which if he refuse to do or to set a price thereon, the other Partners may set her out, and refuse to let him have any part of the profit accruing thereby; only if the Ship be lost, they must make good his part according as it shall be valued; but if it happen the Major part of such Owners re∣fuse to set out any such Vessel, wherein they have equal propriety, they cannot be compelled, but then such Vessel is to be valued and sold, and the like where any of the partners prove deficient or unable to set her forth.</P>
<P>The Master is to be chosen by the Own∣ers, and so he had need, for they are ly∣able
<PB N="336" REF="317"/>
to the Merchants for all dammages, he or his Marriners shall suffer or cause to be done in any Port, Haven, or on the main Ocean; both by the Law Marine and common Law of <HI>England,</HI> and they must sue the Master for reparation.</P>
<P>If a Ship be broken up with an intent to convert her Timber to other uses, and then the parties mind alter, and they will have her rebuilt with the same; the pro∣perty by that means is altered, and the Partnership dissolved: If a man take Planks of another mans to mend his Ship, yet the property remains in the owner; but if a man take Timber designed to Build a Ship, and build a Ship, the property of the Ship shall remain in him whose Timber it was, and not in the Builder: But if the Timber was not designed for the Building a Ship, it is otherwise; if a Master of a Ship take up monies for refitting or victualling his Ship, &amp; there be occasion for so doing, the owners must pay it, but if there be no oc∣casion, they are not bound so to do.</P>
<P>If a man gets possession of a Ship, hav∣ing no Title thereto by the Law Marine, he shall pay dammages; such as shall be prov∣ed to be sustained by the unjust detaining of it from the right owner. If a Ship is Fraighed out, and in any Port an Imbargo

is lay'd thereon, it Bars not the Owners from the Recovery of their contract for Fraight: If any one shall be killed by a fall on Shipboard, in a fresh River, being within the Body of a County, the Ship is accounted a Deodand, and becomes Seisable, tho in such cases it is not strict∣ly observed; but if any one fall and be killed on the Ocean, it is otherwise, for there by Reason of storms or the like, it is supposed such Accidents cannot be a∣voided.</P>

<P>IF a Master of a Ship be intrusted with Goods, and they be imbeselled either in Port or upon the main Ocean, he's Respon∣sible to the Owners or Merchant, and must make them good; nay if a Ship be Fired by carelessness, the Master lies lyable to make both the Ship and Fraight good, nay tho Goods sustain any other dammage, by the neglect of the Master, he is bound to
<PB N="338" REF="318"/>
make them good, for he is <HI>Exercitor Na∣vis,</HI> and is either by the Marine and com∣mon Law, lyable to answer for the neglect or Misdemeanour of his Mariners; but if a Ship be taken by an Enemy, founder, or be lost in a Storm, the Master is not lyable to make satisfaction. If a Master send off his Boat to receive Goods at a Wharf, and they be imbeselled, he must make them good. If a Master lades Goods on Board any of the Kings Enemies Ships, tho his own be Leaky, and by that means such Goods are seised, he becomes lyable to make satisfaction to the Owner, nor at his Pe∣ril ought he unknown to the Merchant or owners to Ship prohibited Goods; and if when he is home-ward laden, he enter or lye by in any Creek, unless driven in by Tem∣pest, and by that means the Cargo becomes Seisable, he shall answer it to the Owner, by Reason he ought to have entered one of his Majesties great Ports; nor must he Sail with false Colours, carry false Coc∣quets or other Papers, for if by such means the Goods are involved in Trouble, lost, or the like, he lies lyable to make Restitution. He must not lade the Ship a∣bove the Birth-mark, set Sail with insuf∣ficient Rigging, stay in a Port, unless up∣on an extraordinary occasion, if the Wind
<PB N="339" REF="318"/>
stands fair for his prosecuting his Voyage, unless it be Tempestuous Weather; or re∣fuse in any Port to pay due Custom, by which any damage may befall the Merchant or Owners, upon pain of his making satis∣faction for the same: if he sends Goods to a Wharf in close Lighters, and send his Mariners to watch them; then if they be im∣bezled, he is bound to make them good, but on the contrary the Wharfenger must be accomptible. If when a Master brings a Ship into any Port, and through his neg∣lect She suffers damage, he is lyable to ans∣wer for it. A Master may sell or impawn part of the lading for money, to mend on refit the Ship, if She be in any danger, but may not do it to defray any charges of his own: no Master is to import or export any Commodities from any of his Majesties Plantations, but in <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Irish</HI> bottoms, or bottoms belonging to the Natives of those Plantations, and that in such a case, the 3 Fourths of the Mariners be likewise English upon pain of Forfeiting the Ship and Goods. These and many Obligations are binding upon a Master, both by the Laws-Marine, and Common.

<HEAD>CHAP. CXVII. Of Fraight and Charter part, according to the Laws, Common, and Marine, with use∣ful observations thereon.</HEAD>
<P>FRaight is commonly agreed on between the owners and the Merchant, by a Writing of Charter-party, wherein are concluded the particulars of the contract; and if there be no such Writing but only earnest given, then if the Merchant recant 'tis held by some, nay and often observed that he only loses his earnest, and that if the owners recant they lose double earnest; tho many learned in the Law are of opi∣nion, that an Action for dammage, if any be su∣stained by such revocation will lye; if a Merchant should hire a Vessel, and not have his Goods ready at the time appointed, and the Vessel lose the Season of the Passage, or a Ship hired be unfiting to Sail, so that the Merchant must either lose the passage of his Goods, or lade them on another Vessel, dammage may be recovered by an Action at common Law.</P>
<P>If a contract be made to such a Port, the
<PB N="341" REF="319"/>
Fraight full laden, and the Ship has broke Ground; altho the Merchant revoke his intentions, yet the Fraight is by the Law Marine due. If in a Voyage a Ship without the neglect of the Master be disa∣bled, he may lade the Goods on Board a∣nother Vessel, and if that Vessel be cast a∣way, he is not lyable to make satisfaction, if he can prove his own Ship was in a sinking condition, had not the Goods been taken out of her; but if this latter appear not he is lyable, unless both of the Ships are cast away: If a Ship be laded in Gross, and no particular number of Tuns mentioned, yet the Merchant shall pay the Summ agreed for. If Pirates set upon a Ship and take part of the lading, yet if the other part be carryed safe to the Port concluded on in the Charter part, Fraight for the whole is due.</P>
<P>If any one Fraight prohibited Goods with∣out the knowledg of the Master or Own∣ers, and they be seized in any Port, or the Ship be detained, the Merchant shall pay Fraight notwithstanding. If a passenger die in the Ship, and none claim his Goods in a Year and a Day, they shall be divided be∣tween the Master, his Mates, and the Cloaths are to be brought to the Ship-Mast head, and after an appraisement made to be
<PB N="342" REF="320"/>
distributed amongst the Mariners, as a re∣ward of their care for seeing the Body put into the Sea; if Fraight be contracted for Transporting of a Woman, and She by the way be delivered, there is no Fraight due for the Infant.</P>
<P>If the owners Fraight out a Ship, and af∣terwards take into it Goods secretly con∣trary to the knowledge of the Merchant, by the Law Marine he loses his Fraight, and if in such a case any of the Merchants Goods be cast overboard in stress of Wea∣ther, the owner must make them good, but this is only when a full Fraight is a∣greed for, but if the owner be not privy to such Goods bringing in, he is not lyable for the defaults of others to the damage a∣foresaid.</P>
<P>By Law the lading of a Ship is tacitly bound for the payment of Fraight, if a Ship put into any Port then that in which She was Fraighted for, and there receives damage, the Owner or Master shall answer the same to the Merchant; for the Charter party ob∣liges the owners to deliver them safe at the Port therein mentioned, unless Ene∣mies or Storms prevent it, and if a Ship suffer damage by Reason of defect in Tack∣ling, the Owners or Master are bound to make it good.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="320"/>If Goods are sent aboard in general it must be specifyed so much, or such Goods as are accustomed for such a Voyage. If a Ship be Fraighted for so many Tuns, and She will not bear them, then there is no more Fraight due, then the Ship is com∣puted to be of Burthen, or for so many Tun as are sent on Board; but if a Ship be Fraighted by the great, and no certain Burthen mentioned, then the Summ agreed upon must be pay'd, or if a Ship be Fraighted for 200 Tuns over or under, 5 Tuns are the allowance either over or under and no more.</P>
<P>If Wines be Fraighted, and by the way a great part of them Leak out, yet the Fraight is due, the defect being in the Cask; tho some are of opinion, that unless eight Inches of Wine be left in each Cask, it is in the Election of the Fraighter, whe∣ther they will pay Fraight or throw the re∣mainder up to the Master for his Fraight. If a Ship be taken in War, and afterwards retaken and proceed on her Voyage, the property is not altered, but when the Voy∣age is performed the Fraight becomes due. If any one contract with a Mariner for Fraight, who is not impowered by the own∣ers, and loss happens, that Mariner is Sub∣ject to an Action only, and the Master or Owner free: If a Ship agree for so much
<PB N="344" REF="321"/>
<HI>per</HI> Month to be pay'd at her return, and She upon her return be cast away, yet the Fraight is to be pay'd for so many Months, as She was abroad on that occasi∣on, as Mariners that dye at Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXIX. Of Wrecks what may properly be termed such according to the Laws Marine, and Common, with Instructions for owners and Masters in case of a Wreck.</HEAD>
<P>A Wreck is properly when a Ship is cast away, and no live thing escapes to Shoar; and then those upon whose Grounds the Goods are cast by the Sea, ought unless they are Perishable to keep them a twelve-month, to see if any will claim them; and if any do take such Goods, and contrary to the known Laws convert them to their own use, they are upon Conviction of the same, to pay four times the value to the owner, and as much to the King; but if the Goods are Perishable, then the Sherif, Cor∣roner, or Bailif, in whose Jurisdiction they are found may sell them, but must be accoun∣table for so much money, to those that can make out the Goods were theirs; and to pre∣vent such Wrecks as much as may be, all
<PB N="345" REF="321"/>
Fisher-men upon severe Penalties are forbid to Fish with Lights in the Night. But if Goods Wrecked be not owned or Sued for within a Year and a Day, they fall to the King's Exchequer by the Law of <HI>Oleron,</HI> and the Islue must be tryed before the Judges of the Wrecks; always provided this Law do not extend to Pirates, Sea-Rovers, Ro∣bers, <HI>Turks,</HI> or Enemies to the Christian Faith, and if any who unjustly detains any such Wrecked Goods, shall refuse to deli∣ver them, or satisfaction to the full value, he shall be Imprisoned, and if a Lords Bailiff be therein found to offend, the Lord is ob∣liged to deliver his Balif's Body to the King. And as for Custom, Wrecked Goods rarely pay any, but if the Ship be cast away, or all the Goods or the Major part of them saved, in such a case they pay an easie Custom, as the Labour of saving them was more or less difficult, and in that case light Goods as Silver and Gold, according to value shall pay less then heavy and Gross Goods. All Wrecks of Whales or great Sturgeon are properly the Kings.</P>
<P>There are other sorts of Wrecks as <HI>Flotsam, Jetsam,</HI> and <HI>Lagan</HI> or <HI>Ligan</HI>; the former is when a Ship is Sunk, and the Goods are found Floating on the Sea. The second is when a Ship is about to sink, and to endea∣vour
<PB N="346" REF="322"/>
to save her, the Goods are cast into the Sea; notwithstanding which the Ship Perish∣es, and the third is when Goods are cast o∣ver to lighten the Ship and She perishes not, but a Buoy is fixed to note the place, that so they may be possibly recovered, especially such Goods as sink down-right, in these cases the King shall have <HI>Flotsam, Jetsem,</HI> and <HI>Lagan</HI>; provided the Ship perishes, or when the owners of the Goods are not known; but when the Ship Perishes not they belong to the Merchant, who upon proof will re∣cover them. These three are commonly the Kings grant, within the high and low Wa∣ter marks by prescription, as it appears by those in the West Countries, who prescribe to have Wrecks as far as they can see a Humber Barrel.</P>
<P>If a Ship be ready to Perish, and all the men for preservation of their Lives escape in their Long-Boat; yet if the Ship drive afterward into any Port, it is no Wreck; and the like if a Ship be taken by Pirates, and after taking out the Men and Goods turned it a Drift.</P>
<P>All owners claiming Wrecks, must make their Proof by their Cocquets or Marks Personal, Testimony upon Oath or the Books of Entery in the Custom-House, and if any such Wreck belongs to the King, the
<PB N="347" REF="322"/>
party must Sue out a Commission to hear and determine, and that by the Oaths of twelve men, or else he may bring his Acti∣on at Law, and make his proof by Verdict, but let him be careful that such his Action be brought within a Year and a Day, or it will not lye; all <HI>Flotsams, Jetsams,</HI> and <HI>Legans</HI> appertain by grant of Charter to the Lord high Admiral, and must be decided if found upon the high Sea, in the Court of Admi∣ralty. Wrecked Goods tho such as are pro∣hibited, are not Forfeitable, by Reason they were not brought in but by the Wind and Tide, contrary to the will of the Owner, as by Law is supposed.</P>
<P>If the Wreck happen by the negligence or fault of the Master, he is lyable to make Satisfaction, but if otherwise the Owners and Fraighters sustain the loss.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXX. Of Averidg and Contribution, according to the Law Marine, if Goods are cast overboard in a storm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and what Goods may in such a case be Ejected, and what not.</HEAD>
<P>IF when a Ship is Fraighted, and at Sea a storm arises, the Master if he finds the Ship in danger, may by the consent or ra∣ther
<PB N="348" REF="323"/>
by consulting his Mariners throw such heavy Goods overboard, as may tend to the Lightning or saving the Ship, and if the Mariners refuse to consent, then it is Law∣ful for him to command it to be done; always provided that he throw over the coarsest Goods, and those that are most Ponderous, and in that case the rest of the Goods in the Ship, shall contribute to those thrown over∣board; the Sailers Cloaths and Provision ex∣cepted. If they are thrown over before half the Voyage is made, then the contribution shall be according to what the Goods cost, but if when above half the Voyage then proporti∣onable to what those that remain are sold for. But upon the arrival of the Ship at the Port intended, the Master and Part of his Crue must swear that such Goods were thrown over for the preservation of the Ship, and the rest of the Goods; and if af∣terwards the Merchant bring his Action a∣gainst the owners or Master, they may plead the special Matter, which will remain in Bar to the Plaintifs proceedings; but if any of the Ships Tackling be lost, no Ave∣ridge or Contribution shall be made, unless the Masts be cut by the Board, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or if a∣ny Goods be secretly brought into the Ship, contrary to the knowledg of the Master and Purser, be ejected, no contribution shall be
<PB N="349" REF="323"/>
made: And by the Law Marine, the Master may refuse (in case of ejection) to deliver the remainder of the Goods before the Con∣tribution is setled, or if in a storm part of the Goods are dammaged, without any neg∣lect of the Master or Sailers, such Goods for so much as they are dammaged, ought to come into the contribution.</P>
<P>If two Ships meet and strike each other, and if it can be proved that either of them did it willfully or by carelesness, then that Ship shall satisfy the damage received by the other, but if either Ships crew Swear their inno∣cency, then the dammage is to be Levyed proportionable between them; if any Eje∣ction of Goods happen by the indiscretion of the stowers in lading the Ship above the Birth mark, or the like; then the Master or Owners ought to make satisfaction. If when a Vessel is entering a Port or otherwise part of the Goods be put into a Lighter or Ship-Boat, and the Boat be cast away, there Contribution must be made; but if the Ship be cast away, and the Lighter or Boat saved, then no Contribution; for note where the Ship at any time Perishes, tho a great part of the Goods be saved, yet they allow no Contribution.</P>
<P>If a Ship be taken by Pirates or Enemies, and the Master contracts with them for
<PB N="350" REF="324"/>
the dismission of the Ship at such a Summ of money, and till the same be pay'd yields himself Prisoner, in that case Contribution must be levyed upon the Ship, and lading for the Ransom of the said Master; and so where a Pirate by consent takes part of the Goods to spare the rest, Contribution must be made, but if he takes them by force or at his own pleasure, then no con∣tribution is to be made, unless the Mer∣chants yield so to do after the Ship is Robbed, but if taken by an Enemy, Letter of Marque or Reprisal the contrary. If Jew∣els be on Board in a Box and not discover∣ed, and they be cast overboard, Contribution shall be for no more then they appeared, <HI>viz.</HI> a Parcel. If any thing in a storm be cast into the Sea, and afterward recovered, then Contribution shall be made for no more then the damage sustained. The Ma∣ster and Purser in case of a storm shall con∣tribute towards Goods Ejected, for the pre∣servation of the Ship and Passenger for such Wares as they have; and if they have no Wares, then for their Cloaths, Rings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to estimation.</P>
<P>Contribution is to be pay'd for a Pilots Fee, for bringing a Ship safe into any Harbour where she is not bound.</P>
<P>If the Master of a Ship, after he has

<P>If Contribution be setled, and the Mer∣chant will not consent to pay it, the Ma∣ster may refuse delivering the Goods, and if an Action be brought, he may Barr the Plaintif by pleading the special matter, yet in a storm there are some Ladings, which ought not to be ejected.

<P>First then the Port of <HI>London,</HI> as by Ex∣chequer setled and declared, extends from the Promontory or Point, called the North Foreland, in the Isle of <HI>Thannet.</HI> Thence Northward to the Nase Point beyond the Sunfleet upon the Coast of <HI>Essex,</HI> and so continues Westward up the River of Thames; and the several Channels, Streams, and Rivers falling into it to <HI>London-Bridge.</HI> The usual known Rights, Liberties, and Priviledges, to the Ports of <HI>Sandwich</HI> and <HI>Ipswich,</HI> and their Members excepted, and in regard that Ships did formerly come up to the Port of <HI>London,</HI> and unlade in seve∣ral obsure Creeks at Staires, to defraud his Majesty of his Customs, it was there∣fore ordained, that a Commission should be forthwith Issued out of the Exchequer, to af∣fix and nominate all such Wharfes, Keys, and other places as his Majesty by virtue of such Commission should appoint, in pursu∣ance of which his Majesty has been pleased to Nominate and Constitute as Lawful Keys, Wharfs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> these following for the Land∣ing of Goods, Merchandise, <HI>&amp;c. viz. Brew∣ers-Key, Chestors-Key, Wool-Dock, Porters-Key, Bear-Key, Wiggons-Key, Youngs-Key,
<PB N="353" REF="325"/>
Ralphs-Key, Smarts-Key, Lyons-Key, Buttolf-Wharf, Hammons-Key, Cocks-Key, Fresh-Wharf, Billingings-Gate,</HI> and the <HI>Bridge-House.</HI> The former of the two latter being appointed a common open place for the Landing or bringing in of Fish, Salt, Vi∣ctuals, or Fuel of all sorts, Fruit of all sorts, Grocery excepted; all Native Mate∣rials for Building, and for exporting the like, but no other Merchandise; and the latter, <HI>viz.</HI> the Bridge-House is appointed for the Landing of Corn for the City store, tho under pretence of the same several Persons at this Day Landed their proper Corn; moreover there are these Keys, <HI>viz.</HI> the Custom-House Key, some Stairs on the West side whereof are declared not to be places for Lading or Shipping of Goods. <HI>Sabs</HI>-Dock has a pair of Stares not held Law∣ful for the Landing or lading of Merchan∣dise. The like has <HI>Dice-Key, Summers-Key,</HI> and <HI>Gaunts-Key</HI>; tho otherwise allow∣able. Therefore it is to be supposed those Stairs that are accepted against were built for Conveniency, since the declaring them free places of lading, and Landing Mer∣chandise.</P>
<P>These Keys, Wharfs and Docks, yearly produce a great Income to the City of <HI>London,</HI> by Scavage, Portage, Packing and Water-Bailage.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="326"/>As first Scavage being an Ancient Toll or Custom, taken by the Majors, Sherifs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Wares shewed or offered to Sail within their Precincts, consists of two parts, <HI>viz.</HI> that which is payable by the Denizen, &amp; that which is payable by the Alien or Strang∣er; and that all Persons Subject to such Duties, may not be imposed on by such as take them, there are Tables mentioning each particular set up and approved of by the Lord Chancellor, Treasurer, President, Steward, and two Justices of the Common-Pleas; and by them Subscribed or some four of them at least, and are to be levyed on Goods inwards and outwards.</P>

<P>All Strangers are to pay the Labour∣ing Porters for making up their Goods ac∣cording to Custom.</P>
<P>Strangers must also pay the Water∣side Porters belonging to the Package-Of∣fice, such Fees for Shipping and Lad∣ing as for several Years past they have done.</P>
<P>The Packers and Waterside-Porters, have Tables expressing the Duties paya∣ble; and such Goods as are not menti∣oned therein must pay according to their true value, so much in the Pound as a∣foresaid for Package and Porterage-duties o∣ver and above.</P>
<P>Another Ancient duty there is called Water-Bailage, which for many Years past the City of <HI>London</HI> have claimed and received for all Goods and Merchan∣dise
<PB N="356" REF="327"/>
imported from any part in the Realm, or out of the Realm, into the Port of <HI>London</HI>: and so the like duties with a little alteration, for all Goods ex∣ported out of the Port of <HI>London,</HI> un∣less the Goods or Merchandise of Free∣men, who are exempted from paying this Du∣ty, tho many Freemen for Reason best known to themselves notwithstanding do voluntarily pay it; but of late there has been considerable Debates, whether the same be due or not, tho no Clause in the Act of Tonnage or Poundage, does any ways Bar those duties.</P>
<P>All Lighters, Wherries, Fisher-Boats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> occupying the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> with∣in the Limits of the Cities Jurisdicti∣on, confirmed by their Charter, pay Summs of Acknowledgement or Duty for the same, which amounts annually to a considerable value. All Markets within the Precincts of the City, pay the Duty of Toll to the behoof of the City.</P>
<P>The Citizens of <HI>London, viz.</HI> those that are Resident are exempted from the Custom or Impost called Prizage, which is, that out of ten Tuns of Wine the King is to have one, paying for it 20 Shil∣lings, but Citizens must not own any Wines so imported under Colour, to se∣cure
<PB N="357" REF="327"/>
Strangers from paying Prisage. If a Freeman live in another City, and send Wines to unlade at the Port of <HI>London</HI>; he shall not be capable of this Priviledge, but must be resident as aforesaid, for by a private Act in the 24 of <HI>Hen.</HI> 6 com∣plaint was made, that the Lord Major would make Strangers Citizens; whereup∣on it was there declared, that this Benefit to be discharged from payment of Prisage, extended not to such Citizens as were made so by Gift, but such as were Legally Citi∣zens, according to the true, intent and mean∣ing thereof, by Service or Adoption, and resident in the said City; and 'tis further observed that if any Merchant not a Citizen break Bulk, tho he deliver but part of his Cargo, yet the Duty is to be levyed upon all, as if all had been unladen. And this Privi∣ledge likewise enjoy the Inhabitants resident in the Cinque-Ports.</P>
<P>Butherage, as I have before said, is 2 Shillings <HI>per</HI> Tun, upon Wines imported by Strangers; but the English are exempted from that Duty. And thus much for the Priviledges, Customs, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> of the City of <HI>London,</HI> in relation to Trade.</P>

<P>These Ports or Publick places are those to which the Officers of the Cu∣stoms are appropriated, which contain and include the Guidances, and Privileges of all the Members and Creeks to them appertaining; being the places appointed for the Lading, and unlading Merchan∣dise.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="329"/>The Members are such places as for∣merly enjoyed Custom-Houses, and have yet Offices or their Deputies attending; they being accounted Lawful places of Lading or unlading all Commodities unless such as are prohibited.</P>
<P>The <HI>Creeks</HI> are places where Officers do or formerly have given their Atten∣dance by way of Prevention, not out of Duty or Right, and are not accounted lawful places to Land or Lade any Goods without Licence or sufference from the Port or Members, under which any such Creek or Creeks is placed; all which as they be at present accounted at the Cu∣stom-House, are as aforesaid being respe∣ctively in the Body of the Counties, and consequently out of the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty; in case any thing more then ordinary is done, or sustained in any of them. And now I shall only inform the Reader, that Commodities of English Growth and Manufacture, may be export∣ed when sold in <HI>England</HI> at certain rates, according to the Statute made in the 12 of <HI>Car.</HI> 2. and so put an end to this Work.</P>
<P>Gunpowder when it exceedeth not the price of five pound <HI>per</HI> Barrel, may be exported; Wheat, Rye, Pease, Beans, Bar∣ly,
<PB N="362" REF="330"/>
Malt, Oats, Pork, Beef, Bacon, But∣ter, Cheese, and Candles; when they do not exceed the Prizes following at the Ports where they are Laded at the time of their Lading, <HI>viz.</HI> Wheat the quarter forty Shillings, Rye, Beans and Pease the quar∣ter twenty four Shillings, Barly and Malt the quarter twenty Shillings, Oats the quar∣ter sixteen Shillings, Bief the Barrel fifty pound, Pork the Barrel six pound ten Shillings, Bacon the pound six Pence, But∣ter the Barrel four pound ten Shillings, Cheese the pound thirty Shillings, Can∣dles the dozen pounds five Shillings, pay∣ing the respective rates according as they are set down in the Book of rates; al∣ways provided that his Majesty may when he sees occasion, prohibit the Exportati∣on of Gunpowder and other Ammuniti∣on.</P>
<P>And thus Reader, have I with much Labour Sailing through many Tempestu∣ous Seas, once again cast Anchor in safe Harbour; hoping this Work may be ad∣vantageous unto many, and useful unto all who are any ways concerned in Trade or Commerce, whether by Navigation or o∣therwise, the which if it does, I have ob∣tained the end of my Design.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FOrasmuch as men who are in a decaying condition, or who have but an ill opinion of their own concernments, instead of being (as some think) the more industrious to resist the evil they apprehended, do contrarywise become the more Languid and ineffectual to all in all their en∣deavoures; neither caring to at∣tempt
<PB REF="332" MS="y"/>
or prosecute even the probable means of their relief: I as a mem∣ber of the Common-Wealth, next to the knowing the precise truth in what Condition the common interest stands, would all in doubtful cases thinkthe best and consequently not dispair without strong and manifest Reasons, care∣fully examining what ever tends to les∣sen my hopes of the Publick Well∣fair.</P>
<P>I have therefore thought fit to ex∣amine the following perswasions, which I find too currant in the World, and too much to have affected the
<PB REF="333" MS="y"/>
minds of some to the prejudice of all, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the Rents of Lands are Generally fallen, that therefore and for many other Reasons, the whole Kingdom growes poorer and poorer; that formerly it abounded with Gold; but now there is a great Scarcity both of Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>That there is no Trade nor im∣ployment for the people, and yet that the Land is underpeopled, that Taxes have been many and great. That <HI>Ireland</HI> and the Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> and other additions to
<PB REF="334" MS="y"/>
the Crown are a Burthen to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that <HI>Scotland</HI> is of no ad∣vantage; that Trade in General doth lamentably decay, that the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> are at our Heels in the Race of Naval power, the <HI>French</HI> grow too fatt upon both, and ap∣pear so Rich and Potent, that it is but their Clemency, that they do not devour their Neighbours; and final∣ly that the Church and State of <HI>England,</HI> are in the same danger with the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> with many other dismal Suggestions, which I do rather Stifle then repeat.</P>
<P><PB REF="332" MS="y"/>'Tis true the Expence of Forraign Commodities, have of late been too great: Much of our Plate had it re∣mained money, would have better serv∣ed Trade, too many matters have been regulated by Laws, with natures long Custom and general consent, ought on∣ly to have Govern'd the Slaughter and Destruction of men by the late Civil Wars, and Plague have been great the Fire of <HI>London</HI> and disaster at <HI>Chattham</HI> have begotten opinions in the Vulgar of the World to our preju∣dice, the Nonconformists increase, the people of <HI>Ireland</HI> think long of their
<PB REF="333" MS="y"/>
settlement. The English there appre∣hend themselves to be Aliens, and are forced to seek a Trade with For∣raigners, which they might maintain with their own Relations in <HI>England,</HI> but notwithstanding all this (the like whereof was always in all places) the Buildings in <HI>London</HI> grow great and Glorious, the <HI>American</HI> Plantations employ <HI>400</HI> Sail of Ships; Auctions in the <HI>East-India</HI> Company are above double the principal money: Those who can give good Security, may have mo∣ney under the Statute interest, materi∣als for Building (oven Oaken Tim∣ber)
<PB REF="334" MS="y"/>
are little the dearer, some cheap∣er, for the rebuilding of <HI>London;</HI> the Exchange seems as full of Merchants as formerly; no more Beggers in the Streets, nor executed for thieves as hereto∣fore: the number of Coaches, and Splendor of Equipage, exceeding former times; the publick Theatres very magnificent; the King has a greater Navy and strong∣er Guards then before our Calamities: the Clergy rich, the Cathedr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls in repair, much Land have been improved, and the price of Food Reasonable; and in Brief no man needs to want that will take moderate pains; that some are poor∣er then others ever was and will be, and
<PB REF="335"/>
that many are Querulous, and En∣vious is an Evil as old as the World.</P>
<P>These general Observations, and that men Eat, and Drink, and Laugh as they use to do, have incouraged me to try if I could comfort others, being satis∣fied my self that the Interest and Af∣fairs in <HI>England</HI> are in no deplorable condition; the Method I take to do this is not yet very usual, for instead of using only Comparative and Superla∣tive words and Intellectual Argu∣ments, I have taken the course (as a Specimen of the Political Arith∣metick

<HEAD>A Discourse of Trade. Being a Comparison between <HI>England</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein the Incouragement of Industry is pro∣moted in these Islands of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. That a small Country and few People by Situation, Trade, and Policy, may be equivalent in Wealth, and Strength to a far greater People and Territories; and particularly that conve∣niencies for Shipping and Water-Carriage do most eminently and fundamentally conduce thereto.</HEAD>
<P>THe first principal Conclusion by reason of it's Length I consider in three parts, whereof the first that a small Country and few People may be e∣quivalent in Wealth and Strength to a far greater People and Territories.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="337"/>This part of the first principal Conclusion needs little proof, forasmuch as one Acre of Land may bear as much Corn and feed as many Cattle as twenty by the difference of the Soyl, some Parcels of Ground are natu∣rally so defensible as that 100 men being possest thereof, can resist the Invasion of 500. Bad Land may be improved and made good, Bog may by dreining be made Mea∣dow; Heath Land may (as in <HI>Flanders</HI>) be made to bear Flax, and Clover-grass, so as to advance in value from 1. to 100. the same Land being built upon may centriple the Rent, which it yieldeth as pasture; one man is nimbler and stronger and more pa∣tient of Labour than another; one man by Art may do as much work as many, <HI>viz.</HI> one man with a Mill can grind as much Corn as 20. can pound in a Mortar, one Printer can make as many Copies as an hundred can write by hand; one horse can carry as much upon Wheels as five men upon their backs, and in a Boat, or upon Ice as 20; so that I say again the first point of this ge∣neral position needs little or no proof.</P>
<P>But the second and more material part of this Conclusion is, that this difference in Land and People arises principally from their Si∣tuation Trade and Policy.</P>
<P>To clear this I shall compare <HI>Holland</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="337"/>
and <HI>Zealand</HI> with the Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> do not contain above 1. Million of <HI>English</HI> Acres, whereas the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> contains above 80.</P>
<P>Now the original and primitive difference holds proportion as Lands to Land; for it is hard to say that when these places were 1st. planted, whether an Acre of Land in <HI>Holland</HI> was better then the like quantity in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI>: Now is there any reason to suppose, but that therefore upon the first Plantation the number of Planters was in proportion to the quantity of Land; wherefore if the People are not in proporti∣on as the Land the same must be attributed to the Situation of the Land, and to the Trade and Policy of the People.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The next thing to be shewn is that <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> at this day is not only <HI>80</HI>th. as rich and strong as <HI>France,</HI> but that it hath advan∣ced to the <HI>3</HI>d. or thereabouts, which I think will appear upon the ballance of the following Particulars, viz.</HEAD>
<P>As for the Wealth of <HI>France,</HI> a certain Map of that Kingdom set forth <HI>An.</HI> 1647. represents it to be 15 Millions, whereof six did belong to the Church, the Author thereof (as I sup∣pose) meaning the Rents of the Land only
<PB N="4" REF="338"/>
And the Author of a most judicious Discourse of Husbandry (supposed to be Sir <HI>Richard Weston</HI>) doth from reason and experience shew that Lands in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> by bear∣ing Flax, Turnips, Clover-grass, Madder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will easily yield 10 pound <HI>per</HI> Acre, so as the Territories of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> should by this account, yield at least 10 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI>; yet I do not believe the same to be so much, nor <HI>France</HI> so little as aforesaid, but rather that one bears to the other as about 7 or 8 to one.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> are one 3d part of those in <HI>Paris</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> which two Cities differ not in People a 20th part from each other as hath appeared by the Bills of Buri∣als and Christenings from each, but the va∣lue of the Buildings in <HI>Amsterdam</HI> may well be half that of <HI>Paris</HI> by reason of the Foun∣dations, Grafts and Bridges, which in <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> are more numerous and chargeable than <HI>Paris</HI>: Moreover the Habitations of the poorest People in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> are twice or thrice as good as those of <HI>France</HI> but the People of the one to the People of the other being but as 13 to 1. the value of the Housing must be as about 5 to 1. The Ship∣ping of <HI>Europe</HI> being about 2 Millions of tuns I suppose the <HI>English</HI> have about 5000000, the <HI>Dutch</HI> 900 thousand, the <HI>French</HI> 100
<PB N="5" REF="338"/>
thousand, the <HI>Hamburgers</HI> and the Subjects of <HI>Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Dantzick</HI> 250 thousand, and <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy, &amp;c.</HI> 250 thousand; so as the Shipping in our case of <HI>France</HI> to that of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> is about 1 to 9: which reckoned great and small one with another at 8 pound <HI>per</HI> Tun makes the worth to be 800 thousand pounds to 7 Mil∣lions, &amp; 2000000 pounds the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Capital in the <HI>East-India</HI> Company is worth about 3 Millions where the <HI>French</HI> has little or nothing.</P>
<P>The value of the Goods exported out of <HI>France</HI> into all parts are supposed quadruple to what is sent to <HI>England</HI> alone, &amp; consequent∣ly in all about 5 Millions; but what is ex∣ported out of <HI>Holland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> is worth 3 Millions; and what is exported thence into all the World besides is sextuple to that Summ.</P>
<P>The Moneys yearly raised by the <HI>French</HI> King, as the same appears by the Book inti∣tuled the <HI>State of France,</HI> dedicated to the King printed <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1669. and set forth se∣veral times by Authority, is 82 Millions of <HI>French</HI> Livers, which is about ½ Millions of pounds Sterling, of which Summ the Author sayes that one 5th part was abated for Nonva∣luers or Insolvencies.</P>
<P>So as (I suppose) not above 5 Millions were effectually raised, but whereas some
<PB N="6" REF="339"/>
say the King of <HI>France</HI> raised 11 Millions as the ⅕ of the Effects of <HI>France,</HI> I humb∣ly affirm, that the Land and Sea forces, all the Buildings and Interleguments which we have heard by common Fame to have been set forth and made in any of these last 7 years needed not to have cost 6 Millions Sterling; wherefore I suppose he hath not raised more, especially since there were ⅕ insolven∣cies when the Tax was at that pitch.</P>
<P>But <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> paying 67 of 100 pay'd by all the United Provinces, and the City of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> paying 27 of the said 67, it follows that if <HI>Amsterdam</HI> hath pay'd 4000 pound <HI>Flemmish per diem,</HI> or about 146000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> or about 80 thousand pound Ster∣ling, that all <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> have paid above 2 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI>; now the Reasons why they pay so much, I think are these <HI>(viz)</HI> 1. the Author of the State of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> saith so.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Excise of Victuals at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> seems above half the Original value of the same <HI>(viz)</HI> ground Corn pays 20 Stivers the Bushel, or 63 Gilders the Last, Beer 113 Stivers the Barrel, housing ⅙ of Rent, fruit ⅛ of what it cost; other Commodities 1/7 ⅛ 1/9 1/12 Salt <HI>ad libitum,</HI> all weighed Goods pay besides the premises a vast sum: now if the expence of the People of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> at a Medium, and
<PB N="7" REF="339"/>
without Excise, were 8 pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> whereas in <HI>England</HI> 'tis 7 pound, then if all the several Imposts above named raise it 5 pound more, there being 160 thousand Souls in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the Sum of 800 thou∣sand pound Sterling <HI>per Annum</HI> will thereby be raised.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Though the Expence of each Head should be 13 pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> 'tis well known that there be few in <HI>Amsterdam</HI> who do not earn much more than the said Ex∣pence.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. If <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> pay <HI>per Annum</HI> 2,000,000 pounds, then all the Pro∣vinces together must pay about 3 Millions, less then which Sum <HI>per Annum</HI> perhaps is not sufficient to have maintained the Naval War with <HI>England,</HI> 72 thousand land Forces besides all other the ordinary charges of their Government, whereof the Church is there a part. To conclude, it seems from the Premi∣ses, that all <HI>France</HI> doth not raise above thrice as much from the publick Charge, as <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> alone do.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Interest of Money in <HI>France</HI> 7 pounds <HI>per Centum,</HI> but in <HI>Holland</HI> scarce half so much.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. The Country of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zea∣land,</HI> consisting as it were of Islands guarded with the Sea, Shipping and Marshes, is de∣fensible
<PB N="8" REF="340"/>
at ¼ the charge of a plain open Country is, and where the Seat of War may be both Winter and Summer, whereas in others nothing can be done but in the Summer only.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. But above all the particulars hi∣therto considered that of Superlucration ought chiefly to be taken in, for if a Prince have never so many Subjects and his Country never so good, yet if either through sloath or extravagant Expences or oppression and injustice, what ever is gained, shall be spent as fast as gotten, the State must be account∣ed poor. Wherefore let it be considered how much, or how many times rather <HI>Hol∣land</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> are now above what they were 100 years ago; which we must also do of <HI>France</HI>; now if <HI>France</HI> hath scarce doubled it's Wealth and Power, and that the other have decupled theirs; I shall give the preference to the latter, even altho the 9 increased by the one should not exceed the one half gained by the other; because one hath a Store for 9 years, and the other but for 1. To conclude upon the whole, that though <HI>France</HI> being Peopled to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> as 13 to 1, and in quantity of good Land as 80 to 1, yet is not 13 times Richer and Stronger, much less 80 times, nor much above thrice, which was to be proved.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="340"/>Having thus dispatched the two first Branches of the first principal Conclusion, it follows to shew that this difference of im∣provement in Wealth and Strength, arises in particular from conveniencies for Shipping and Water-carriage.</P>
<P>Many writing on this Subject do so magni∣fie the <HI>Hollanders</HI> as if they were more, and all other Nations less then men, (as to the matter of Trade and Policy) making them Angels, and others Fools, Brutes and Sots as to those particulars, whereas I take the foun∣dation of their Atchievements to lie ori∣ginally in the Situation of the Country, whereby they do things inimitable to o∣thers, and have advantages whereof others are incapable.</P>
<P>First, The Soyl of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> is low Land, rich and fertile, whereby it is able to feed many men, and so as that men may live near each other for their mutual Assistance in Trade, I say that 1000 Acres that can feed 1000 Souls is better than 10000 of no more effect, for the following reasons to it <HI>(viz.)</HI> first suppose some great Fabrick were in building by 1000 men, shall not much more time be spared if that they lived all upon 1000 Acres, then if they were forced to live upon 10 times as large a Scope of Land?</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="341"/>2dly. The charge of their care of their Souls, and the Ministry would be far greater in the one case then the other, as also of Mutual defence in case of invasion, and even of Thieves and Robbers; moreover the charge of the Ad∣ministration of Justice would be much easier where Witnesses and Parties may be easily Summoned, Attendance less expensive when mens Actions would be better known, when wrong and Justice would not be covered as in thin-peopled places they are.</P>
<P>Lastly those who live in solitary places must be their own Soldiers, Divines, Phy∣sicians and Lawyers, and must have their Hou∣ses stored with necessary provisions (like a Ship going upon a long Voyage) to the great wast and needless expence of such pro∣visions: the value of this first conveniency to the <HI>Dutch</HI> I reckon to be about 100 thousand pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Holland</HI> is a level Country, so as, if in any part thereof a Wind-Mill may be set up, and by it's being moist and vaporous, there is always Wind stirring over it, by which advantage the labour of many thou∣sand hands is saved, forasmuch as a Mill made by one man in half a year will do as much labour as 4 men for 5 years together; this advantage is greater or less where im∣ployment and ease of Labour is so, but in
<PB N="11" REF="341"/>
<HI>Holland</HI> it is eminently great, and the worth of this Conveniency between near 100 and 150 thousand pound.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. there is much more to be gained by Manufacture than Husbandry, and by Mer∣chandise than Manufacture, but <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> being seated at the Mouths of 3 long great Rivers, and passing through rich Countries do keep all the Inhabitants upon the sides of those Rivers but as Husbandmen, whilst themselves are the Manufactors of their Commodities, and do dispence them into all Parts of the World, making re∣turns for the same at what price almost they please themselves; and in short, they keep the Trade of those Countries through which the same Rivers pass, the va∣lue of this 3d convenience is 200 thousand pound.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. In <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> there is scarce any place of work or business one Mile distance from a Navigable Water, and the charge of Water-carriage is generally but the 15th or 20th part of Land-carriages, wherefore if there be as much Trade there as in <HI>France,</HI> then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> can out-sell the <HI>French</HI> 14/15 of all the Expence of all travel∣ling postage and carriage whatsoever, which even in <HI>England</HI> I take to be 300 thousand pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> where the very postage
<PB N="12" REF="342"/>
of Letters costs the People perhaps 50 thou∣sand pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> though farmed at much less, and all other Labours of Hor∣ses and Porters at least six times as much; the value of this conveniency I estimate to be above 300 thousand pounds <HI>per An∣num.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. The defensibleness of the Country by reason of it's Situation in the Sea upon Islands, and in the Marshes, impassible ground, dicked and trenched, especially considering how the place is aimed at for it's Wealth, I say the charge for defending this Country is easier than if it were a plain Champion at least 200 thousand pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6thly. <HI>Holland</HI> is so considerable for keep∣ing Ships in Harbour with small Expence of men and ground-tackle that it saves them <HI>per Annum</HI> 200 thousand pounds of what must be spent in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Now if all these natural Advantages do amount to above one Million <HI>per Annum</HI> of profit, and that the Trade of all <HI>Europe,</HI> nay of the whole World, with which our <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI> do trade, is not above 45 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI>; and if 1/50 of the value be 1/7 of the profit, it is plain that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> may command and govern the whole Trade.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. Those who have their Situation
<PB N="13" REF="342"/>
thus towards the Sea, abound with Fish at home, and having also the command of Ship∣ping, have by consequence the Fishing Trade, whereof that of <HI>Herring</HI> alone brings more yearly profit to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> than the Trade of the <HI>West-Indies</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> or of the <HI>East</HI> to themselves, being as some say <HI>viis</HI> and <HI>modis</HI> of above 3 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI> pro∣fit.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. It is not to be doubted but those who have the Trade of Fishing and Ship∣ping will secure themselves of the Trade of Timber, for Ships, Boats, Masts, and Casks, of Hemp for Cordage, Sails and Nets, of Salt, of Iron, as also of Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Brimstone, Oyl and Tal∣low, as necessary Appurtenances to Shipping and Fishing.</P>
<P N="9">9thly. Those who predominate in Fishing and Shipping have more occasion then o∣thers to frequent all parts of the World, and to observe what is wanting or redun∣dant every where, and what each People can do, and what they desire, and conse∣quently to be the Factors and Carriers for the whole World of Trade, upon which ground they bring all Native Commodities to be Manufactured at home, and carried back to the Country where they grow, all which we see, for do they not work the
<PB N="14" REF="343"/>
Sugars of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> the Timber and Iron of <HI>Baltick,</HI> the Hemp of <HI>Russia,</HI> the Lead, Tin, and Wool of <HI>England,</HI> the Quick-Silver and Silk of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Yarn and dying Stuffs of <HI>Turkey? &amp;c.</HI> to be short in all the ancient States and Empires those who had the Shipping had the Wealth; and if 2 <HI>per Centum</HI> in the price of Commodities, be perhaps 20 <HI>per Centum</HI> in the Gain, it is manifest that they who can in 45 Millions under-sell others by one Million (upon Account of Mutual Interest and instrin∣sick Advantages only) may easily have the Trade of the World, without such Ange∣lical Wits and Judgments as some attribute to the <HI>Hollander.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Having thus done with their Situation I come now to their Trade.</HEAD>
<P>It is commonly seen that each Country flourisheth in the Manufacture of it's own Native Commodity, <HI>viz. England</HI> for Woollen-Manufactures, <HI>France</HI> for Paper, <HI>Swihltand</HI> for Iron-ware, <HI>Portugal</HI> for Con∣fectures, <HI>Italy</HI> for Silks. Upon which princi∣ple it follows, that <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> must flourish most in the Trade of Shipping, and so become Carriers and Factors to the whole World of Trade; now the Ad∣vantages
<PB N="15" REF="343"/>
of Shipping Trade are as follow∣eth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. Husbandmen, Sea-men, Souldiers and Merchants are the very Pillars of the Com∣monwealth, all the other great professions do arise out of the infirmities and miscarri∣ages of those: Now the Sea-man is 3 of these 4; for every Sea-man of industry and in∣genuity is not only a Navigator, but a Mer∣chant, &amp; also a Souldier, not because he has of∣ten occasion to fight, and handle Arms, but because he is Mamilarized with hardship and hazards extending to Life and Limb; for Training and Duelling is a small part of a Soldier, in respect of his last men∣tioned Qualifications, the one being quickly and presently learned, the other not without many years most painful Experience, wherefore to have the occa∣sion of abounding in Sea-men is a vast con∣veniency.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. the Husbandmen of <HI>England</HI> earn but about 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Week, but the Sea-man has as good as 12 <HI>s.</HI> in Wages, Victuals, Drink, and (as it were) Housing with o∣ther Accomodations, so a Seaman is ineffect 3 Husbandmen, wherefore there is little Ploughing or Sowing of Corn in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Zealand,</HI> or breeding of young Cattle, but their Land is improved by building
<PB N="16" REF="344"/>
Houses, Ships, Engines, Dickes, Wharfs, Gardens of pleasure, extraordinary Flowers and Fruits, Dairy and feeding of Cattel, for Rape, Flax, Madder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Foun∣dations of several Advantagious Manufa∣ctures.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Whereas the imployments of other men is confined to their own Country, that of a Sea-man is free to the whole World; so as where Trade may (as they call it) be dead, here or there, now and then, it is certain that somewhere or other in the World, as Trade is always quick enough <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Provision is always plentiful, the Benefit whereof they who command the Shipping enjoy, and they only.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The great and ultimate effects of Trade is not wealth at large, but particularly abundance of Silver, Gold, and Jewels which are not perishable, but are wealth at all times and all places; whereas abundance of Wine, Corn, Fowl, Flesh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are riches but <HI>hic et nunc</HI>: So as the raising of such Commodities, and the following of such Trade is not profitable before others, which do store the Countrys with Silver, Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the labour of Seamen and Freight of Ships, of the Nature of an exported Commodity, the over-plus whereof a∣bove what is imported brings home Mo∣ney, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="17" REF="344"/>5thly. Those who have the command of the Sea-Trade may work at easier Freight, with more profit then others at greater, for as Cloth must be cheaper made, when one Cards, another Spins, another Weaves, ano∣ther Draws, another Dresses, another Pres∣ses, and Packs; then when all the Operati∣ons above mentioned were clunsily perform∣ed by the same hand; so those who com∣mand the Trade of Shipping, can build long slight Ships, for carrying Masts, Firr, Timber, Boards, Bolkes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that one is for Lead, Iron, Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one sort of Vessels to Trade at Ports, where they need never ly aground, others where they must jump upon the Sand, twice every 12 hours, one sort of Vessel, and way of Manning in time of Peace, and for cheap gross Goods, ano∣ther for War, and precious Commodities, one sort of Vessel for the Turbulent Sea, another for Inland Waters and Rivers, one sort of Vessels and Rigging where hast is requisite, for the Maidenhead of a Market, another where ⅕ or 4/1 part of the time makes no matter, one sort of Masting and Rigging for long Voyages, another for Coasting, one sort of Vessels for Fishing, another for Trade, one sort for War, for this or the contrary, another for Burthen only, some for Oars, some for Poles, some
<PB N="18" REF="345"/>
for Sails, and some for draught by men or Horses, some for the Northern Navigations amongst Ice, and some for the South a∣gainst Storms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this I take to be the chief of several Reasons why the <HI>Hollanders</HI> can go at less Freight than their Neighbours <HI>(viz.)</HI> because they can afford a particular sort of Vessels, for each particular Trade.</P>
<P>I have shewn how the Situation has gi∣ven them Shipping, and how shipping in ef∣fects has given them all other Trade, and how Foreign Traffick must give them as much Manufactures as they can mannage themselves, and as for the over-plus make the rest of the World but as Work∣men to their Ships; it now remains to shew the effects of their policy superstru∣cted upon these natural advantages, not as some think the excess of their understand∣ings. I have omitted to mention that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were 100 years since a poor and oppressed People, living in a Country natu∣rally cold moist and unpleasant, and were withal persecuted for their Etrodoxy in Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>From whence it necessarily follows that this People must labour hard, and set all hands to work, and Rich and Poor, young and old must study the Art of Number, Weight and Mea∣sure, must fare hard, provide for Impotents,
<PB N="19" REF="345"/>
and for Orphans, out of hope to make profit by their Labours, must punish the Lazy by Labours. I say all these particulars, said to be the subtile Excogitations of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> seem to me but with what could not almost have been otherwise.</P>
<P>Liberty of Conscience, Registry of Con∣veyances, small Customs, Banks, Lom∣bards, and Law-Merchant, rise all from the same Spring, and tend to the same Sea. As for Loans of Interest, 'tis also a necessa∣ry effect of all the premises, and not the fruit of their contrivance.</P>
<P>Wherefore we shall only shew in parti∣cular, the Efficacy of each, and first, of Li∣berty of Conscience; but before I enter upon these, I shall mention a practice almost for∣gotten, whether it refers to Trade or Poli∣cy is not material, which is, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> undermasting and sayling of such of their Shipping as carry cheap and gross Goods, and whose Sail doth not depend much upon Season.</P>
<P>It is to be noted that of 2 equal and like Vessels if one spreads 1600 yards of like Canvas, and the other 2500, their Speed is but as 4 to 5, so as one soon brings home the same Timber in 4 days, as the other will in 5, now if we consider that although those Ships be but 4 or 5 days under Sayl, that
<PB N="20" REF="346"/>
they are perhaps 30 upon the Voyage, so as the one is but 1/30 parts longer upon the whole Voyage than the other, tho ⅕ longer un∣der Sail; now if Masts, Yards, Rigging, Cables, and Anchors, do depend upon the quantity and extent of the Sails, and con∣sequently hands also, it follows that the one Vessel goes at 3/1 less charge losing but 1/80 of the time and of what depends there∣upon.</P>
<P>I come to the first Policy of the <HI>Dutch, viz,</HI> Liberty of Conscience, which I can con∣ceive they grant upon these grounds, (but keeping up always a force to maintain the Common Peace)</P>
<P N="1">1st. They themselves broke with <HI>Spain</HI> to avoid the Imposition of the Cler∣gy.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Dissenters of this kind are for the most part thinking, sober and patient men, and such as believe, that Labour &amp; Industry is their duty towards God, (how Erroneous soever their Principles be.)</P>
<P N="3">3dly. These People believing the Justice of God, and seeing most licentious persons to enjoy most of the World and it's best things, will never venture to be of the same Religion and Profession with voluptua∣ries, and men of extreme Wealth and Pow∣er, who they think have their Portion in this World.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="21" REF="346"/>4thly. They cannot but know, that no man can believe what himself pleases, and to force men to say they believe when they do not, is vain, absurd, and without Honor to God.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> knowing them∣selves not to be an Infallible Church, and that others had the same Scriptures for guide as themselves, and withal the same Interest to save their Souls, did not think fit to make this matter their business, no more but to make Bonds of the Seamen they im∣ploy, not to cast away their own Ships and lives.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> observe that in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> especially the Latter, the Church men are about 100 to one, to what they use or need, the principal care of whom is to preserve Uniformity, and this they take to be a superfluous charge.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. They observe where most endea∣vours have been used to keep Uniformity their Exterodoxy hath most abounded.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. They believe that if ⅕ of the Peo∣ple were Exterodox, and that if the whole quarter should by Miracle be removed, that within a small time 4/1 of the Remainder would again become Exterodox some way or other, it being Natural for men to differ in Opinions in Matters above sense and rea∣son,
<PB N="22" REF="347"/>
and for those who have less Wealth to think thry have the more Wit and Under∣standing, especially in the things of God which they think chiefly to belong to the Poor.</P>
<P N="9">9thly. They think the case of the Primi∣tive Christians, as it is represented in the Acts of the Apostles, looks like that of the present Dissenters, (I mean externally) moreover it is to be observed that Trade does not (as some think) best flourish under popular Government, but rather that Trade is more vigorously carried on in every State and Government by the exterodox par∣ty of the same, and such as profess O∣pinions differ from what are publickly e∣stablished (that is to say) in <HI>India</HI> where the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion is Authorized.</P>
<P>There the <HI>Banians</HI> are the most considera∣ble Merchants, in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, the <HI>Jews</HI> and Christians, at <HI>Venice, Naples, Le∣gorn, Genica,</HI> and <HI>Lisbon Jews,</HI> and now Pa∣pists Merchants Strangers. But to be short, in the part of <HI>Europe</HI> where the <HI>Roman</HI> Catho∣lick Religion now has, or lately has had Esta∣blishment, there 3 qrs. of the whole Trade is in the hands of such as have separated from the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Eng∣land, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as also these of the United Provinces, with <HI>Denmark,
<PB N="23" REF="347"/>
Sweden</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> together with the Sub∣jects of the <HI>Norman</HI> Protestant Princes, and the Hans-Towns do at this day possess a quarter of the Trade of the World, and e∣ven <HI>France</HI> it self the <HI>Hugonets</HI> are propor∣tionably far the greatest Trades, nor is it to be denyed but that in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the said <HI>Roman</HI> Religion is not Authorized, but the professors thereof have a great part of the Trade, from whence it follows that Trade is not fixed to any Species of Religi∣on as such, but rather as before hath been the said, to the heterodox party of the whole; the truth whereof appears also in all the par∣ticular Towns of greatest Trade in <HI>England</HI>; nor do I find reason to believe that the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Seamen in the whole World are sufficient to man effectually a Fleet equal to what the King of <HI>England</HI> now has, but the now Papist-Seamen can do above thrice as much. Wherefore he whom this latter party does effectionately own to be their Head, cannot probably be wronged in his Sea-con∣cernments by the Author; from whence it follows, that for the Advancement of Trade (if that be a Sufficient Reason) indul∣gence must be granted in matters of Opinion, those Licentious Actings as even in <HI>Holland</HI> be restrained by force.</P>
<P>The 2d. Policy or help to Trade used by
<PB N="24" REF="348"/>
the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> is Securing the Titles to Lands and Houses, for although Lands &amp; Houses may be called <HI>Terra firma et res immo∣biles,</HI> yet the Title unto them is no more certain then it pleaseth the Laws, and Authority to make them, wherefore the <HI>Hol∣anders</HI> do by Registries and other ways of assurance make the Title as immoveable as the Lands, for there can be no incourage∣ment to Industry where there is no Assu∣rance of what shall be gotten by it, and where by Fraud and Corruption one man may take away with ease and by a trick what another has gotten by extream labour and pains.</P>
<P>There has been much Discourse about introducing of Registories into <HI>England,</HI> the Lawyers for the most part do object against it, alledging the Titles of Lands in <HI>England</HI> are sufficiently secure already; wherefore omitting the considerations, of small and oblique Reasons, <HI>pro et contra,</HI> it were good that enquiry were made from the Officers of several Courts to what Sum or Value pur∣chasers damnified for these last 10 Yeahs, by such fraudulent conveyance as Registries would have prevented, the 10th part where∣of at a Medium is the annual loss which the People sustain for want of them, and then Computation is to be made, of the annual
<PB N="25" REF="348"/>
charge of Registring such extraordinary con∣veyances, would secure the Titles of Lands more by comparing these two Summs, the Que∣stion so much agitated, may be determined.</P>
<P>Their third Policy is their Bank, the use whereof is to encrease money or rather to make a small Sum equivalent to Trade in a greater, for the effecting whereof these things are to be considered: First how much Money will drive the Trade of the Nation, 2dly, how much current Money there is actually in the Nation. 3dly. how much will serve to make all payments of under 5 Pound, or any other convenient Sum throughout the year. 4thly. for what Sum the Keepers of the Bank are unquestionable security. If all these 4 particulars be well known, then it may be also known how much of ready Mo∣ney above mentioned, may safely and pro∣perly be lodged in the Bank, and to how much ready current Money the said deposi∣ted Mony is equivalent; (as for example) suppose 100 thousand pounds will drive the Trade of the Nation, and suppose there be but 60 thousand pounds of ready Mony in the same; suppose also the 20 thousand pound will drive one, and answer all pay∣ments made of under 150 pound, in this case 40 of the 60 being put into the Brank will be equivalent unto 80, which 80, and 20,
<PB N="26" REF="349"/>
kept out of the Bank, do make up 100, <HI>viz.</HI> enough to drive the Trade, as was purposed. Where note that the Bank-keepers must be re∣sponsible for double the Sum intrusted with them, and must have power to levy upon the General weight they happen to lose, unto particular Men; upon which grounds the Bankers may freely make use of the re∣ceived 40 pound, whereby the said Sum and with the like Sum in credit, makes 80 pound, and with the 20 reserved 100.</P>
<P>I might here add many more particulars, but being the same has already been noted by others, I conclude only with adding one observation which I think to be of conse∣quence; That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do ridd their hands of 2 Trades, which are of great tur∣moil and danger, and yet of least profit. The 1st whereof is that of a common and private Soldier, for such they can hire from <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> to ven∣ture their Lives for 6 pence a day, whilst themselves safely and quietly follow such Trades whereby the meanest of them gain 6 times as much, and withal by this enter∣taining of Strangers for Souldiers their Country becomes more and more peopled, forasmuch as the Children of such Strangers are <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and take to Trades, whilst new Strangers are admitted <HI>in finitum</HI>; be∣sides,
<PB N="27" REF="349"/>
these Souldiers at convenient intervals, do at least as much work as is equivalent to what they spend; and consequently by this way of imploying of Strangers for Souldiers, they people the Country, and save their own Persons from Danger and Misery, without any real Expence; effecting by this Method, what others have in vain attemp∣ed by Laws for naturalizing of Strangers; as if men could be charmed to transport themselves, from their own native, into a forreign Country, meerly by words, and for the bare leave of being called by a new Name. In <HI>Ireland,</HI> Laws for Naturalizati∣on have had little Effect, to bring in Aliens; and 'tis no wonder if Englishmen will not go thither, without they may have the pay of Souldiers, or some other Advantage a∣mounting to Maintainance.</P>
<P>Having intimated the way by which the Hollanders do increase their People, I shall here digress to set down the way of com∣puting the value of every Head one with another, and that the instance of People in <HI>England; (viz.)</HI> Suppose the People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> be six Millions in number, that their Ex∣pence at 7 pound <HI>per</HI> head be forty two Mil∣lions, suppose also that the Rents of Lands be eight Millions, and the profit of all the personal Estate be six Millions more, it must
<PB N="28" REF="350"/>
needs follow, that the Labour of the Peo∣ple have supplied the remaining thirty six Millions; the which multiplyed by twenty, (the mass of Mankind being worth twenty years Purchase as well as Land) makes five hundred and twenty Millions, as the value of the whole People; which number divi∣ded by six Millions, makes above eight Pound Sterling to be the value of each Head, Man, Woman, and Child, and of a dull Per∣sons twice as much: From whence we may learn to compute, the Loss we have sustain∣ed by the Plague, by the slaughter of Men in War, and by sending them abroad unto the Service of forreign Princes. The other Trade the Hollanders have ridd their Hand of, is the old patriarchal Trade of being Cowkeepers, and in a great measure of which concerns plowing and sowing of Corn, have put that Imployment upon the Danes and Polanders, from whence they have their young Cattle and Corn. Here we may take notice that as Trades and curious Arts in∣crease, so the Trade of Husbandry will de∣crease, unless the Wages of Husbandmen must rise, and consequently the Rents of Lands must fall.</P>
<P>For proof whereof I dare affirm that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andmen of <HI>England,</HI> who now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Pence a day, or thereabouts,
<PB N="29" REF="350"/>
could become Tradesmen, and earn sixteen Pence a day, which is no great Wages, two Shillings, and two Shillings and six Pence being usually given; that then it would be the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI> to throw up their Husbandry, and make no use of their Lands, but for Grass, Horses, Milch-Cows, Gardens and Orchards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which if it be so, and that Trade and Manufacture have increased in <HI>England, (viz.)</HI> If a quarter part of the People apply themselves to these Faculties more then they did heretofore, and if the price of Corn be no greater now then when Husbandmen were more numerous, and Tradesmen fewer: It follows from the single Reason (tho others may be added) that if the Rents of Lands must fall: as for Example, suppose the price of Wheat be fifty or sixty Pence the Bushel; now if the Rent of the Land whereon it grew be the third Sheaf, then of the sixty Pence, twenty Pence is for the Land, and fourty Pence for the Husbandman; but if the Husbandman's Wages should rise ⅛ part, or from eight to nine Pence <HI>per diem</HI>; then the Husbandman's Share in the Bushel of Wheat, raised from fourty to fourty five Pence, and consequently the Rent of the Land must fall from twenty to fifteen Pence; for we suppose the price of the Wheat still re∣mains;
<PB N="30" REF="351"/>
especially since we can't raise it, for if we did attempt it Corn would be brought unto us as unto <HI>Holland,</HI> from Forraign parts, where the State of Husbandry was not changed.</P>
<P>And thus I have done with the first Prin∣cipal Conclusion, That a small Territory and even a few people may by Situation Trade and Policy be made Equivalent to a far greater, and that conveniences for Ship∣ping and Water-Carriage do most Eminent∣ly and Fundamentally conduce thereunto.</P>

the case would be also the same; but if what is levied as aforesaid be only Transferred from one Hand to another, then we are only to consider whether the said money or Commo∣dities are taken from an improving Hand, and given to an ill Husband, or <HI>vice versa</HI>; as for Example, suppose money by way of Tax be taken from one, who spendeth in Superfluous Eating and Drinking, and de∣livered to another, who imploys the same in improving of Lands, in Fishing, in work∣ing of Mines, and Manufacture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is manifest, that such Tax is an advantage to the State whereof the said different Persons are members; nay, if money be taken from him who spendeth the same as aforesaid upon Eating and Drinking, or any other Perishing Commodities, and Transferred to one who bestowed it on Cloaths, I say that even in this case the Common-Wealth has some little advantage, because Cloaths do not perish al∣together so soon as Drinks; but if spent in Furniture of Houses, the advantage is yet little more; if in Building of Houses; yet more; if in improving of Lands, working of Mines and Fishing, yet more; but most of all in bringing Gold and Silver into the Country, because those things are not only perishable but are esteemable for Wealth at all times, and every where; whereas other
<PB N="32" REF="352"/>
Commodities, which are Perishable or whose value depends upon the Fashion, or which are Contingently scarce and plentiful, are Wealth <HI>pro hic &amp; nunc,</HI> as has been else∣where said; in the next Place if the People of any Country, who have not already a full imployment, should be injoyned or Tax∣ed to work upon such Commodities as are imported from abroad, I say, such a Tax does also improve the Common-Wealth; moreover if Persons who live by Begging, Cheating, Stealing, Gaming, Borrowing without intention of Restoring, who by these ways do get from the Credulous and careless more then is Sufficient for the Sub∣sistance of such Persons, I say, that tho the State should have no present imployment for such Persons, and consequently should be forced to clear the whole charge of their lively-hood, yet it were more for the Publick Profit to give all such Persons a regular and Competent allowance by a Publick Tax, then to suffer them to spend extravagantly at the only charge of careless and credulous and good natured People, and to expose the Common-Wealth to the loss of so many o∣ther men, whose lives are taken away for the crimes which ill Discipline does occasion; on the contrary, if the Stocks of Labori∣ous and ingenious men, who are not only
<PB N="33" REF="352"/>
Beautifying the Country where they live by Elegant Diet, Apparel, Furniture, Housing, Pleasant Gardens and Orchards and Publick Edifices <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but also are increasing the Gold, and Silver, and Jewels thereof, by Trade and Armes; I say, if the Stock of these men should be Diminished by a Tax, and Transferred to such as do nothing at all but to Eat, Drink, Sing, Play, Dance, nay to such as Study the Metaphysicks, or other needless Speculations, or else imploy themselves in any other way which pro∣duceth no material thing, or things of real use and value, in the common Wealth; in this case the Wealth of the Publick will be diminished otherwise then as such exer∣cises are Recreations and Refreshments of the minds; and which being moderately used, do qualify and dispose men to what in it self is more considerable.</P>
<P>Wherefore upon the whole matter, to know whether a Tax will do good or harm, the State of the People and of their Imploy∣ments must be well known, that is to say, what part of the People are unfit for Labour by their impotency and infancy, and also what part are exempt from the same by rea∣son of their Wealths, Function or Dignities, by reason of their charge and imployments, otherwise Governing Directing and Prefer∣ring
<PB N="34" REF="353"/>
those who are appointed to Labour and Arts.</P>
<P>In the next place Computations must be made, what part of those who are fit for Labour and Arts, as aforesaid, are able to per∣form the Work of the Nation in it's present State and Measure.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is to be considered, whether the re∣mainder can make all, or any part of these Commodities which are imported from a∣broad, which of them and how much in par∣ticular; the remainder of such Sort of Peo∣ple, if any be, may safely and without pos∣sible prejudice to the Common-Wealth be imployed in Arts and Exercises of Pleasure and Ornament; the greatest whereof is the improvement of Natural Knowledge.</P>
<P>Having in general illustrated this Point, which I think needs no other Proof but il∣lustration, I come next to intimate that no part of <HI>Europe</HI> has paid so much by way of Tax as <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> for these last Forty years; and yet no Country has in the same time increased—comparably to them; and it is manifest they have followed the ge∣neral rates above-mentioned; for they Tax Meats and Drinks most heavily of all, to restrain the excessive expence of those things which twenty four hours do's as to the use of man, wholly annihilate; and they are
<PB N="35" REF="353"/>
more Favourable to Commodities to the greater duration: nor do they tax accord∣ing to what men gain, but in extraordinary cases, but alwaies according to what men spend, and most of all to what they spend needlesly and without Prospect of return; up∣on which Grounds their Customs upon Goods imported and exported are general∣ly low; as if they intended by them only to keep an Account, of what Forreign Trade, and to retaliate upon their Neighbours States, the prejudices done them by their Prohibiti∣on and Imposition.</P>
<P>It is farther to be observed that since th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> year 1636, the Taxes and Publick Levies made in <HI>England Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> have been Prodigiously greater then at any time heretofore, and yet the said Kingdoms have increased in their Wealth and Strength for these last Forty years, as shall hereafter be shewn; it is said that the French King doth at present levy the Fifth part of his peoples Wealth, and yet great Obstructions is made of the present Riches and Strength of that Kingdom; altho great care must be had in distinguishing between the Wealth of the peo∣ple and that of an absolute Monarch, who taketh from the people where, when, and in what Proportion he pleaseth, the Sub∣jects of two Monarchs may be equally Rich,
<PB N="36" REF="354"/>
and yet one Monarch may be double as Rich as the other; <HI>viz.</HI> If one take the Tenth part of the Peoples Substance to his own dispose, and the other Twentyeth; nay, the Monarch of a poor people may appear more splendid and glorious then that of a Richer; which perhaps may be somewhat the case of <HI>France,</HI> as hereafter shall be exa∣mined. As an Instance and Application of what has been said I conceive that in <HI>Ireland</HI> where∣in is above one hundred thousand people, near three hundred thousand Smoaks or Hearths, it were more tolerable for the people, and more profitable for the King, that each head paid two Shillngs-worth of Flax, then that each Smoke should pay two Shillings in Sil∣ver, and yet for these following Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ireland</HI> being under-Peopled, and Cat∣tle and Land very cheap, store of Fish and Fowl, the Ground yielding every where ex∣cellent Roots (and particularly that bread like Root-Potatoes) and withal they be∣ing able to perform their Husbandry with such Harness and Tackling as each man can make, living in such Houses as (almost) every man can Build; and every Houswife being a Spinner and Dyer of Wool, and Yarn, they can live and Subject after their present Fashions, without the use of Gold and Silver money, and can supply them∣selves,
<PB N="37" REF="354"/>
with necessaries above named, with∣out Labouring two Hours <HI>per diem.</HI> Now it has been found by reason of insolvencies a∣rising, rather from the uselesness, then want of Money amongst these poor People, that from 300000 Hearths, which should have yielded 30 thousand pounds, not much above 15000 thousand pounds of money could be levied; whereas it is easily imagined that 4 or 5 People dwelling in that Cottage which has but one Smoke could easily have Plant∣ed a ground-Plat of 40 Foot Square with Flax, or the 50th. part of an Acre; for so much ground will bear eighth or Ten Shil∣lings-worth of that Commodity, and the rent of so much ground in few places amounts to a Penny; nor is there any skill requisite to this Practice, wherewith the Country is not already Familiar. Now as for a Merchant for the said Flax, there is imported into <HI>Holland</HI> it self, over and above what the Country produces, as much Flax as is there sold for between eighth Score and 200000 pound. And into <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land</HI> is imported as much Linnen Cloth made of Flax and there Spent as is worth above half a Million of money, as hereafter shall be shewn. Wherefore having shewn that Silver money is useless to the poor People of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> that half the Hearth-money could
<PB N="38" REF="355"/>
scarce be raised by Reason thereof, that the People are ⅕ part imployed, that the People and Land of <HI>Ireland</HI> are competently qua∣lifyed for Flax, that one Penny-worth of Land will produce Ten Shillings-worth of the same, and that there is Market enow and enow for above 100000 pounds-worth; I conceive my Proposition sufficiently prov∣ed, at least to set forward and promote a practice, especially since if all the Flax so produced should yield nothing, yet there is nothing lost, the same time having been worse spent before upon the same Ground: the like Tax of two Shillings <HI>per</HI> head, may be raised with the like advantage from the People of <HI>England</HI> which would amount to Six hundred thousand pounds.—<HI>per Annum</HI> to be paid in Flax manufactured in∣to all sorts of Linens, Threds, Tapes and Laces which we now receive from <HI>France, Flanders, Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> the value whereof does far exceed the sum last men∣tioned, as has appeared by the examination of Particulars.</P>
<P>It is observed by Clothiers and others who imploy great numbers of poor people, that when Corn is extreamly plentiful the La∣bour of the Poor is Proportionably dear, and Scarce to be had at all; (So licentious are they who Labour only to Eat, or rather
<PB N="39" REF="355"/>
to Drink:) wherefore when so many Acres of Corn as do usually produce sufficient store for the Nation, shall produce perhaps dou∣ble to what is exported, or necessary; it seems not unreasonable, that this common Blessing of God should be imployed to the common good of the People, represented by their Sovereign; much less that the same should be abused by the vile and brutish part of Mankind, to the prejudice of the Common-Wealth; and consequently that such Surplusage of Corn should be sent to Publick Store-Houses, from thence to be disposed of to the best advantage of the Publick. Now if the Corn spent in <HI>England</HI> at five Shilings <HI>per</HI> Bushel Wheat, and two Shillings six Pence Barley be worth 10,000,000. It follows that in Years in great Plenty when the said Grains are ⅓ part cheaper, that a vast advantage might accrue to the Common-Wealth, which now is spent in once feeding the People in quantity, or quality, and so▪ in disposing them to their usual Labour. The like may be said of Sugar, Tobacco, and Pepper, which Customs has now made necessary to all sorts of People, and with overplanting them has made un∣reasonably cheap; I say, it is not absurd that the Publick should be advantaged by this
<PB N="40" REF="356"/>
Extraordinary Plenty.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>That an Excise should be laid upon Corn also is not unreasonable not only for this but for other Reasons.</HEAD>
<P>The way of the present <HI>Militia</HI> or train-Bands in a Gentle Tax upon the Country, because it is only a few Days Labour in the Year, of a few in respect of the whole, using their own Goods, that is, their own Armes. Now if there be 300,0000. of Males in <HI>England</HI> there be above 200,000. of them who are between the Age of sixteen and thirty unmarryed Persons, and who live by their Labour and Service; for of so many the present <HI>Militia</HI> consists, and if 150,000. of these were Armed and trained as Foot, and 50000 as Horse, the said Force at Land together with 30,000. men at Sea, would by Gods ordinary Blessing, defend the Na∣tion being an Island against any force in view; but the charge of Arming, disci∣plining and rendevouzing all their men twice or thrice a Year would be a very Gentle Tax levied by the People themselves and paid to themselves. Moreover if out of the said number ⅓ part were selected of such as are more then ordinary fit for War, and exercised and rendevouzed fourteen or fif∣teen
<PB N="41" REF="356"/>
times <HI>per Annum,</HI> the charge thereof being but a fortnights pay in the Year, would be also a very Gentle Tax. Lastly if out of this last mentioned number ¼ again should be selected, making 16,000. Foot, and 6000 Horse to be Exercised and rendevouzed forty Days in the Year, I say that the charge of all these three <HI>Militia</HI>'s, allowing the latter six Weaks pay <HI>per Annum,</HI> would not cost <HI>per Annum</HI> above 120,000. pounds which I take to be so easie a burthen for so great a Benefit.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as the present <HI>Navy</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> requires 36,000. men to man it, and for that the <HI>English</HI> Trade of Shipping re∣quires about 48,000. men to manage it, it follows that there ought to be about 48,000. competently qualifyed for these Ser∣vices; for want whereof, we see it is a long while before a Royal <HI>Navy</HI> can be made, which till it be, is of no Effectual use but lies at charge. And we see likewise upon their occasions that Merchants are put to great straights, and inconveniencies, and do pay excise-rates for the carrying on their Trade. Now if 24,000. able Bodyed Trades∣men whereby 6000 <HI>per Annum</HI> brought up and fitted for Sea-service, and for their incou∣ragement allowed twenty Shillings <HI>per Annum</HI> for every Year they had been at Sea, even
<PB N="42" REF="357"/>
when they stay at home, not exceeding six pound for those who have served six years or upwards; it follows that about 72000. pound at the <HI>medium</HI> of three pound <HI>per</HI> man would so satiate the whole number; and so forasmuch as half the Sea-men which manage the Merchants Trade are supposed to be always in Harbour, and are about 40000 together with the said half, the Auxi∣liaries last mentioned, would upon Emer∣gencies man out the whole Royal <HI>Navy,</HI> leaving to the Merchant 12000 of the able Auxiliaries to perform their business in Harbour, till others come home from the Sea; I say that more then this Summ 72000 pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> is Fruitlesly spent &amp; over-paid by the Merchants whensoever a great Fleet is to be fitted out. Now these whom I call Auxiliary Seamen are such as have another Trade besides wherewith to maintain themselves when they are not imployed at Sea; and the charge of main∣taining themselves the 72000 pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> I take to be little or nothing for the Reasons above-mentioned, and conse∣quently an easie Tax to the people because levied by and paid to themselves. As we pro∣pounded, that <HI>Ireland,</HI> should be Taxed with Flax, and <HI>England</HI> by Linnen and other Manufactures of the same; so I con∣ceive
<PB N="43" REF="357"/>
that <HI>Scotland</HI> might be Taxed as much to be paid in Herrings, as <HI>Ireland</HI> in Flax. Now these three Taxes of Flax, Linnen and Herrings, and the maintenance of the Triple <HI>Militia,</HI> and of the Auxiliary Seamen above-mentioned, do all five of them together a∣mount to 1,000,000. pounds of money, the raising whereof is not a Million spent but gain'd to the Common-Wealth, unless it can be made appear that by Reason of all or any of them the Exportations of Wollen Manufactures, Lead and Tin, are lessened, or of such Commodities as our own East and West <HI>India</HI> Trade do pro∣duce; for as much as I conceive that the Exportation of these last mentioned Com∣modities is the Touch-stone, whereby the Wealth of <HI>England</HI> is Tried, and the Pulse whereby the Health of the Kingdom may be discerned.</P>

<HEAD>CAP. III. That France cannot by Reason of na∣tural and perpetual Impediments be more Powerful at Sea then <HI>England,</HI> or the low Countries.</HEAD>
<P>POwer at Sea consists chiefly in men a∣ble to fight at Sea; and that in such Shipping as is most proper for the Seas. Wherein they serve; and those are in these Northern Sea-Ships from between 300 to 1300 Tuns, and of these such as Draw much Water, and have a deep latih in the Sea, in order to keep a good Wind and not to fall too Leward, a matter of vast advantage in Sea-Service; wherefore it is to be Examined, first, Whether the French King has Ports in the Northern Seas, where he has most occasion, for his Fleets of War in any Consists above, to receive the Vessels above-mentioned in all Weather, both in Winter and Summer Seats; for if the <HI>French</HI> King could bring to Sea an equal number of Fighting men with the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Hol∣landers</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="358"/>
in small Float Leward Vessels, he would certainly be of the weaker side; for a Vessel of 1000 Tuns man'd with 500 Fight∣ing men with five Vessels of 200 Tuns each man'd with 100 men apiece, shall in com∣mon Reason have the better offensively and defensively; for asmuch as the great Ship can carry such Ordnance as can reach the small ones at a far greater distance, then these can reach, or at lest hurt the other, and can batrer and sink at a distance, when a small one can scarce pierce.</P>
<P>Moreover it is more difficult for men out of a small vessel to enter a tall Ship, then for men from an higher place to leap down in∣to a lower; nor is small Shot so effectual upon a tall Ship, as <HI>vice versa.</HI> And as for Vessels drawing much Water, and conse∣quently keeping a good Wind, they can toke or tear Leward Vessels at pleasure, and secure themselves from being boarded by them.</P>
<P>Moreover the Windward Ship has a fair∣er mark at a Leward Ship, then <HI>vice versa,</HI> and can place her shot upon such parts of the Leward Vessel as upon the next tack will be under Water. Now the French King having no Ports able to receive large Wind∣ward Vessels between <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Ʋshant,</HI> what other Ships he can bring into those
<PB N="46" REF="359"/>
Seas will not be considerable; as for the wide Ocean which his Harbours of <HI>Breas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Brovage</HI> do look into, it affordeth him no advantage upon an Enemy, there being so great a Latitude of engaging, or not, even when the Parties are in sight of each other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wherefore altho the French King were immensly rich, and could build what Ships he pleased both for number and quality, yet if he have not Ports to receive and shelter that sort and size of Shipping which is fit for his purpose, his Riches will in this case be Fruitless and a meer expence, without any return or profit. Some will say that other Nations can't build so good Ships as the <HI>English,</HI> I do indeed hope they can't; but because it seems too possible that they may sooner or later, by Practice and Ex∣perience, I shall not make use of that Ar∣gument, having only bound my self to shew that the Impediments of <HI>France</HI> (as to this purpose) are natural and perpetual, Ships and Guns do not fight of themselves, but men who act and manage them; where∣fore it is more material to shew that the French King, neither has, nor can have men sufficient to man a Fleet of equal Strength, to that of the King of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Navy</HI> consists of
<PB N="47" REF="359"/>
about 70,000. Tuns of Shipping, which re∣quires 36,000. men to man; these men be∣ing supposed to be divided into eight parts, 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part must be Persons of great Experience and Reputation in Sea-Service; another ⅛ part must be such as have used the Sea seven Years, and upwards; half of them or ¼ part must be such as have used the Sea above a twelve Month, <HI>viz.</HI> 2, 3, 4, 5, or six Years, al∣lowing but one quarter of the whole compli∣ment, to be such as never were at Sea at all, or at most but one Voyage, or upon one Expe∣dition; so that at a medium, I reckon the whole Fleet must be men of three or four Years growth one with another. <HI>Fournier,</HI> a late judicious Writer making it his business to persuade the World how considerable the Kings of <HI>France</HI> was, or might be at Sea, in ninety two or ninety three Pages of his Hierography, saith, that there was one place in <HI>Britany</HI> which had Fur∣nished the King with 1400 Seamen, and that perhaps the whole Sea coast of <HI>France</HI> might have furnished him with fifteen times as many. Now supposing the whole Allega∣tion were true, yet the same number a∣mounts but to 21,000, all which if the whole Trade of Shipping in <HI>France</HI> were quite and clean abandoned, would not by above a third man in a Fleet, be equiva∣lent
<PB N="48" REF="360"/>
to that of the King of <HI>England,</HI> and if the Trade were but barely kept alive there would not be one third part men e∣nough to man the said Fleet.</P>
<P>But if the Shipping Trade of <HI>France</HI> be not above a quarter as great as that of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and that one third part of the same, namely the Fishing Trade to the Banks of new-found Land is not peculiar nor Fixed to the <HI>French</HI>; then I say, that if the King of <HI>England</HI> who has Power to press men cannot under two or three Months time man his Fleet, then the French King with less then a quarter of the same help can never do it at all; for in <HI>France,</HI> as shall be elsewhere shewn, there are not a 15000 Tun of Trading Vessels, and consequently not a∣bove 15,000. Seamen reckoning a man to every tenth Tun, and it has been shewed that the French King can't at present man such a Fleet as is above described.</P>
<P>We come next to shew that he never can bring under natural and perpetual impe∣diments <HI>viz.</HI> First if there be but 15,000. Seaman in all <HI>France</HI> to manage it's Trade, it is not to be supposed that the said trade should be distinguished, nor that it should spare above five of the said 15,000. towards managing of the Fleet, which requires 35,000. men; now the deficient 30000 must
<PB N="49" REF="360"/>
be supplyed out of these four ways; e∣ther by taking in Land-men, of which sort there must not be above 10,000, since the Seamen will never be contented without being the Major part, nor do they Hear∣tily wish well to Land-men at all, or re∣joyce even at those Successes of which the said Land-men can claim any share, think∣ing it hard that themselves, who are bred to Miserable and Painful and dangerous im∣ployments and yet profitable to the Com∣mon-Wealth, should at a time when Booty and purchase may be gotten, be Dog'd or hindred with any Conjunction, which Land∣men are forced to admit these to any e∣qual share with themselves.</P>
<P>Secondly the Seamen which are suppo∣sed 20,000 must be had, that is, shired from other Nations, which can't be without Tempting 'em with so much wages as ex∣ceeds that given by Merchants; and with∣al Counterpoyse the dammage of being hang∣ed by their own Prince, and allowed no quarter if taken, the trouble of carrying themselves away when restraints are upon 'em, and also the infamy of having been Apostates to their Country and Cause. I say their wages must be more than double to what their own Prince gives them; and their <HI>Aurum</HI> must be very great, that they
<PB N="50" REF="361"/>
shall not at long run be abused by those who imploy them (as hating the Traytor tho loving the Treason) I say moreover that those who will be thus tempted away must be of the basest &amp; lewdest sort of Seamen, &amp; such as have not enough of Honor and Conscience to qualifie them for any Gallant performance.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another way to exonerate Seamen is, to put great numbers of Land-men upon Ships of War in order to bring always Sea∣men; but this course can't be effectual, not only for the abovementioned Antipathy between Land-men and Seamen, but also because 'tis seen that men at Sea do not ap∣ply themselves to Labour and Practice with∣out more necessity then happens in over man'd Shipping. For where there are fifty men in a Vessel that Ten can sufficiently Navigate, the Supernumerary forty will improve little; but where there shall be of∣ten but one or two Supernumeraries, then necessity will often call upon every one to set his hand to the work, which must be well done at the Peril of their lives; more∣over Seamen shifting Vessels every six or twelve months, do sometimes Sail in small Barges, sometimes in midlingships, and sometimes in greater Vessels of defence, sometimes in Lighters, sometimes in Hoyes, sometimes in Ketches, sometimes in three
<PB N="51" REF="361"/>
wasted Ships, sometimes they go to the north∣ward, sometimes to the Southward, some∣times they Coast, sometimes they Cross the Ocean; by all which Varieties of Ser∣vice they do in time compleat themselves is every part and Circumstance of this fa∣culty: Whereas those who go out for a Summer in a man of War, have not the Variety of Practice, nor a direct necessity of doing any thing at all; besides it is three or four Years at a medium that a Seaman must be made, neither can there be less then three Seamen to make the fourth of a Land¦man, consequently the fifteen thousand Sea∣men can increase but five thousand Seamen in three or four Years, and unless their Trade should increase with their Seamen in Pro∣portion, the King must be forced to be at the charge of this improvement, out of the quick Stock which is intolerable, so as the question which now remains is whether the Shipping Trade of <HI>France</HI> is like to increase, upon which account it is to be considered, that <HI>France</HI> is stored with all kind of ne∣cessaries within it self, as Corn, Cattle, Wine, Salt, Linnen-Cloth, Rape, Silk, Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As they need little Shipping to import more Commodities of Weight and Bulk, neither is there any thing of Bulk exported out of <HI>France</HI> but Wines and Salt,
<PB N="52" REF="362"/>
the Weight whereof is under 1000,000. Tun <HI>per Annum,</HI> yielding not imployment to above twenty five thousand Tun of Shipping, and these are for the most part <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> who are not only already in pos∣session of the said Trade, but also are bet∣ter fitted to maintain it then the <HI>French</HI> are, or perhaps ever can be, and that for the following Reasons, <HI>viz.</HI> Because the <HI>French</HI> can't Victual so cheap as the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> nor Sayl with so few Hands. Se∣condly the <HI>French</HI> for want of good Coasts and Harbours, can't keep their Ships in Port under the charge that the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Hollanders</HI> can. Thirdly by Reason of the pau∣city and distance of their Harbours one from another their Seamen and Tradesmen relating to Shipping can't correspond with, or Assist, one another so easily, cheaply, advantageously, as in other places; wherefore if their Shipping-Trade is not like to increase within themselves, and much less to increase by their beating out the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> from being the Carriers of the World, it follows then, their Seamen will not be increased by their increase of their Trade, wherefore and for that they are not like to be increased by any of their several ways above spe∣cifyed, and for that their parts are not
<PB N="53" REF="362"/>
fit to retain Ships of Burthen and quality fit for their purpose, and that by Reason of less fitness of their Ports then those of their Neighbours: I conceive that which was propounded has been competently proved.</P>
<P>The aforenamed <HI>Fournier</HI> has Laboured to prove the contrary to all this in the ninety Second and ninety eight Page of his Hydrography, unto which I refer the Rea∣der, not thinking his Arguments of any Weight at all in the present case, nor in∣deed does he make his comparison with <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Hollanders</HI> but with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who, nor the Grand Senior (the latter of whom has greater advantages to be Power∣ful at Sea then the French King) could never attain to any illustrious greatness in Naval Power, having after attempted but never succeeded in the same, nor is it easie to believe that the King of <HI>England</HI> should for so many Years have continued in his Title to the Soveraignty of the narrow Seas, against his Neighbours ambitious enough to have gotten it from him, had not their impediments been natural and per∣petual, and such as we say do obstruct the most Christian King.</P>

And if any man will be Heterodox in behalf of the French Interest, I could be contented against my Judgment to allow the <HI>French</HI> King's Territories to be a seventh, sixth, or fifth part greater then those of the King of <HI>England,</HI> believing that both Princes have more Land then they do imploy to its ut∣most use.</P>
<P>And here I beg leave among the several matters, I intend for serious, to interpose a jocular, and perhaps a Ridiculous digression, and which I indeed desire men to look upon rather as a Dream, then a rational Propositi∣on: Which is if that all the moveables and People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the High-lands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were transported into the Kingdom of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> that then the King and his Subjects, would thereby become more Rich and Strong; both offensively and defensive∣ly, then now they are.</P>
<P>Its true, I have heard many wise men say, when they were bewailing the vast Losses of the <HI>English,</HI> in preventing and suppressing Rebellions in <HI>Ireland</HI>; and considering how little profit has returned either to the King or Subjects of <HI>England</HI> for these five hundred Years doing and suffering in that Countrey; I say, I have heard Wise men in such their Melancholies, wish that the Peo∣ple
<PB N="56" REF="364"/>
of <HI>Ireland</HI> being saved, that that I∣sland were sunk under Water. Now it troubles me that the Distempers of my Mind in this point, carry me to Dream, that the Benefits of these Wishes may Practically be obtained without sinking that vast Moun∣tainous Island under Water; which I take to be somewhat difficult, for altho <HI>Dutch</HI> En∣gineers may drein its Bogs, yet I know no Artists that could sink its Mountains.</P>
<P>If ingenious and Learned men, amongst whom I reckon Sr. <HI>Thomas Moore,</HI> and <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> have disputed that we who think our selves awake, are, or may be really in a Dream: And if the greatest absurdity of Dreams, is but a Preposterous and Tumul∣tuary Contexture of Reallities, I will crave the umbrage of these great Men to say some∣thing too, of this wild Conception, with Sub∣mission to the better Judgments of all those that can prove themselves awake: If there were but one man Living in <HI>England,</HI> then the benefit of the whole Territories could be but the third Lively-hood of that one Man: But if another man were added, the Rent or Benefit of the same would be double, if three triple; and so forewards until so many were Planted in it, as the whole Territory could afford Food unto; for if a man would know what any piece
<PB N="57" REF="364"/>
of Land is worth, the true natural questi∣on must be; how many Men will it feed, and how many Men are there to be fed.</P>
<P>But to speak more Practically, Land of the same quantity and quality in <HI>England,</HI> is generally worth three or four times as much as in <HI>Ireland</HI>? And but one quarter, and a third of what it is in <HI>Holland</HI>; because <HI>England</HI> is four times so well Peopled as <HI>Ireland,</HI> and be a quarter so well as <HI>Holland</HI>: And moreover, where the Rent of Land is advanced, by reason of the multitude of People, there the number of years pur∣chase for which the Inheritance may be sold is also advanced, tho perhaps not in the ve∣ry same Proportion; for twenty Shillings <HI>per Annum</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> may be worth but eight pound, and in <HI>England</HI> where Tithes are very sure about twenty pound, in <HI>Hol∣land</HI> about thirty pound, I suppose that in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> there may be above 1800,000 People, or about ⅕ part of what is in all the three Kingdoms. Where∣fore the first question will be, whether <HI>Eng∣land, Wales,</HI> or the <HI>Lowland</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> can't afford Food, that is to say, Corn, Flesh, Fish, and Fowl, to a ⅕ more People then are at present planted upon it; with the same Labour that the said ⅕ part does now take where they are, for if so, then what
<PB N="58" REF="365"/>
is propounded is naturally possible. Second∣ly it is to be inquired into, what the move∣ables which upon such removable, must be left behind are worth; for if they are worth less than the advancement of the price of Land in <HI>England</HI> will amount unto, then the Proposal is to be considered.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the relict Land and the immovables left behind upon them may be sold for mo∣ney, or if no other Nation shall dare to meddle with them without paying well for them, and if the Nation who shall be admit∣ted shall be less able to prejudice and annoy the Transplanters into <HI>England</HI> then before; then I conceive the whole proposal will be a pleasant Dream indeed.</P>
<P>As to the first part, whether <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Lowlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> will mantain one fifth more then they now do, that is to say, nine Millions of Souls in all, I say, first that the said Territories of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> con∣tain about thirty six Millions of Acres, that is four Acres for every Head, Man, Woman and Child, but the united Provinces do not allow ½ Acre, and <HI>England</HI> it self, rescind∣ing <HI>Wales,</HI> has but three Acres to ever Head according to the present State of Tillage and Husbandry. Now if so considered that <HI>Eng∣land</HI> having but three Acres to a Head, do so abound in Victuals as that it makes Laws
<PB N="59" REF="365"/>
against the importation of Cattle, Flesh and Fish from abroad, and that the Drein∣ing of the Fens, improving of Forrests, in∣closing of Commons, Sowing of cinque-Foyl and Clover-Grass be grumbled against by Landlords, are the way to depress the price of Victuals, then it plainly follows, that till then three Acres improved, as it may be, will serve the turn, and consequently that four will Suffice abundantly. I could here set down the very number of Acres that would bear Bread and Drink, Corn, toge∣ther with Flesh, Butter, and Cheese, suffici∣ent to Victual nine Millions of Persons, as they are Victualled in Ships and regular Families; but I shall only say in general that 12,000,00. will do it, with supposing that Roots, Fruits, Fish, and Fowl, and the or∣dinary profit of Lead, Tin, Iron-Mines, and Woods would piece up any defect that may be found. As to the second I say that the Land and Housing of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>High∣lands</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> at the present Merchant-Rates, are not worth ten Millions of money, nor would the actual charge of making the Transplantation amount to two Millions more; so then the question will be whether the benefit expected from this Transplanta∣tion will exceed two Millions.</P>
<P>To which I say that the advantage will
<PB N="60" REF="366"/>
probably be six times the last mentioned Summ, or about seventy two Millions. For if the rent of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> and the low Land of <HI>Scotland</HI> be above nine Mil∣lions <HI>per Annum</HI>; and if this fifth part of the people be Superadded unto the present inhabitants of these Countries; then the rent will amount to 10,800,000. and the number of Years purchase will rise from seventeen ½ to ⅕ more which is twenty one, so that the Land which is worth but nine Millions at seventeen ½ Years purchase mak∣ing an hundred fifty seven Millions and a half will then be worth 10,800,000. at one and twenty Years purchase, <HI>viz.</HI> 226,800,000. that is, 69,300,000. more then was before; and if any Prince willing to enlarge his Territories will give three Millions for the said relinquished Land and Housing, which were estimated to be worth ten Millions, then the whole profit will be above 72,000,000. or six times the value as the same was above computed; but if any man should ob∣ject that will be dangerous unto <HI>England</HI> to be put into the Lands of any other Nati∣ons, I answer in short that that Nation who ever shall purchase it being divided by means of the said purchase, shall not be more able to en∣joy <HI>England</HI> then now in it's united condition.</P>
<P>Now if any man shall desire a more clear
<PB N="61" REF="366"/>
explanation how and by what means the Rents of Lands shall rise by this closer coha∣bitation of people above described, I an∣swer that the advantage will arise in Trans∣planting about eighteen thousand people from the Poor and Miserable Trade of Hus∣bandry, to more Beneficial Handicraft; for which the Superaddition is to be made, a ve∣ry little addition of Husbandry to the same Lands will produce a fifth part more Food; consequently the additional Hands earning but forty Shillings <HI>per Annum</HI> more, (as they may very well to eight pound <HI>per An∣num</HI> at some other Trade; the superlucra∣tion will be above 3,600,000. pound, which at twenty Years purchase is seventy two Millions. Moreover as the Inhabitants of Cities and Towns spend more Commodi∣ties and make greater consumption then those who live in wild thin Peopled Countries; so when <HI>England</HI> shall be thicker Peopled in manner before described, the very same peo∣ple shall then spend more then when they lived more sordidly, inurbantly and further asunder, and more out of the sight, obser∣vation and Emulation of each other; every man desiring to put on better Apparel when he appears in company, then when he has no occasion to be seen.</P>
<P>I further add to the charge of the govern∣ment,
<PB N="62" REF="367"/>
Civil, Military, and Ecclesiastical, would be more cheap, safe and effectual, in this condition of close habitation then otherwise, as not only Reason, but the ex∣ample of the united Provinces do demonstrate. But let this whole digression pass from a meer Dream, I suppose will serve to prove that in case the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Terri∣tories should be a little less then those of the <HI>French</HI> King, that forasmuch as neither of them are over Peopled, that the diffe∣rence is not material to the question in Hand; wherefore supposing the French Kings ad∣vantages to be little or nothing in point of Territory, we come next to examine and compare the number of Subjects which each of those Monarchs do govern. The Book called the State of <HI>France</HI> makes the King∣dom consist of twenty seven Parishes; and another Book written by a Substantial Au∣thor, who profoundly enquires into the State of the Church and Church-men of <HI>France,</HI> sets down as an extraordinary case, that a Parish in <HI>France</HI> should have six hun∣dred Souls, where I suppose the said Author who has so well examined the matter, is not of opinion that every Parish one with a∣nother has above five hundred, by which reck∣oning the whole people of <HI>France</HI> are a∣bout thirteen Millions 500,000: Now the
<PB N="63" REF="367"/>
people of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> with the Islands adjoyning, by computation from the number of Parishes (which com∣monly have more people in Protestant Churches then in Popish Countries) as also from the Hearth-money, Post-money and Excise, do amount to above nine Millions; there are in new-<HI>England</HI> about fifty thou∣sand men mustered in Arms, about eighty thousand able to bear Arms, and conse∣quently about five hundred thousand in all; but this last I leave to every man's con∣jecture, and I see no Reason why in all the rest of the Plantations there should not be five hundred thousand more, and conse∣quently I suppose the King of <HI>England</HI> hath above ten Millions of Subjests, <HI>ubivis terra∣rum orbis.</HI> Altho it be very material to know the number of Subjects, belonging to each Prince; yet when the question is con∣cerning their Wealth and Strength, it is also material to examine how many of 'em do get more then they spend, and how many less: in order whereunto, it is to be considered, that in the King of Englands do∣minions there are twenty thousand Church∣men, but in <HI>France,</HI> as the aforementioned Author of theirs does aver who sets down the particular number of each Religious order, there are about 270000. <HI>viz.</HI> 250000.
<PB N="64" REF="368"/>
more then we think are necessary; that is to say, two hundred and fifty thousand with-drawn out of the World; now the said number of adult and able-Bodyed Persons are equivalent to about double the same number of the Promiscuous Mass of Mankind; and the same Author affirms that the said Religious Persons do spend one with another above eighteen pence <HI>per diem</HI> which is Triple to what a Labouring man requires: Wherefore the said two hundred &amp; fifty thousand Church-men, living as they do make the <HI>French</HI> King 13,500. thousand to be really no better then twelve Millions or thereabouts. In the next place it is to be considered that the inhabitants of the inner parts of <HI>France</HI> remote from the Sea can't be probably Superlucrators. Now if there be two Millions in the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Dominions more then in the French Kings who earn more then they spend, or if ten men in <HI>England</HI> earn more then twelve in <HI>France,</HI> then the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> are as effective as to the gain∣ing of Wealth and Riches as those of <HI>France,</HI> and if Ten men can defend themselves as well in Islands as twelve men upon the Continent, then the said Ten being not con∣cerned to increase their Territory by the invasion of others are as effectual as the
<PB N="65" REF="368"/>
twelve in point of Strength also; where∣fore that there are more Superlucrators in the <HI>English</HI> then in the <HI>French</HI> Dominions, we say as followeth. There be in <HI>England Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> about sixty Millions Seamen, in <HI>France</HI> about a quarter so many; but one Seaman earns as much as three com∣mon Husbandmen; wherefore this diffe∣rence of Seamen added to the account of the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Subjects, the equivalent of 90,500,000. Husbandmen.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> six thousand Tuns of Shipping, worth a∣bout 4500,000. 4 ½. and the actual charge of maintaining the Shipping aforesaid by new building and reparation is about ⅓ of the said Summ, which is the wages of 150. Husbandmen, but it is not the wages of a∣bove ⅓ so many Artisans as are imployed upon Shipping of all sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> Ship∣wrights, Calkers, Joyners, Carvers, Paint∣ers, Blockmakers, Rope-makers, Mastmak∣ers, Smiths of several sorts, Flagmakers, Com∣passmakers, Brewers, Bakers, and all sorts of Victuallers, all sorts of Trades-men relat∣ing to Guns and Gunners-Stores; wherefore there being four times more of these Arti∣sans in <HI>England</HI> then in <HI>France,</HI> they further add to the account of the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Subjects the equivalent 80 m. Husbandmen more.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="369"/>The Sea line of <HI>England Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> and the adjacent Islands is about 3,800. Miles, according to which length and the whole content of Acres the said Land would be an oblong or Parallelogram Figure of 3,800. long, and twenty five Miles broad, and consequently every part of <HI>England, Scot∣land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> is one with another but about twelve Miles from the Sea; where∣as <HI>France</HI> containing but about one thousand Miles of Sea line is like the computation above sixty five Miles from the Sea-side, and considering the paucity of Ports in compari∣son to what are in the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Dominions as good as seventy Miles di∣stance from a Port; upon which grounds it is clear that <HI>England</HI> can be supplyed with all Gross and Bulky Commodities of For∣reign growth and manufacture at far cheaper rates then <HI>France</HI> can be; <HI>viz.</HI> above four Shillings <HI>per Annum</HI> Rent cheaper the Land carriage; for the difference (betwen <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>France</HI>) of the distance from a Port being so much or near thereabouts, now to what advantage this convenience a∣mounts upon the importation and expor∣tation of Bulky Commodities, can't be less the Labour of one thousand of People, mean∣ing by Bulky Commodities all sort of Tim∣ber Blank and Staves for Cask, and all Iron,
<PB N="67" REF="369"/>
Lead, Stones, Brick, and Tiles for build∣ing; all Corn, Sart and Drink, all Flesh and Fish, and indeed all other Commo∣dities, wherein the gain and loss of four Shillings <HI>per cent.</HI> is considerable. Where note the like Wines are sold in the inward parts of <HI>France</HI> for four or five pounds a Tun which near the Ports yield seven pound.</P>
<P>Moreover upon this principal the decay of Timber in <HI>England</HI> is no very formida∣ble thing; as the rebuilding of <HI>London,</HI> and of the Ships wasted by the Dutch-War, do clearly manifest: nor can there be any want of Corn or other necessary provision in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> unless the Weather has been universally unseasonable for growth of the same, which seldom or never happens; for the same cause which makes dearth in one place, does after cause plenty in another, wet-weather being propitious to Highlands, which drown∣eth the low.</P>
<P>It is observed that the poor of <HI>France</HI> have generally less wages then in <HI>England,</HI> and yet their Victuals are generally dearer there, which being so, there may be more Superlucration in <HI>England</HI> then in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly I offer it to the consideration of all those who have travelled through <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> whether the Plebeian of <HI>England,</HI> for they constitute the Bulks of
<PB N="68" REF="370"/>
any Nation; do not spend one sixth more then the Plebeian of <HI>France</HI>; and if so it is necessary they must first get it, and conse∣quently that Ten Millions of the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Subjects are equivalent to twelve of the French Kings, and upon the whole matter to the thirteen ½ Millions, at which the <HI>French</HI> Nation was estimated.</P>
<P>It will be here objected that the Splendor and Magnificences of the French King ap∣pearing greater then those of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> that the Wealth of <HI>France</HI> must be proportionably greater then that of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> but that does not follow forasmuch as the apparent greatness of the King does de∣pend upon the quarter parts of the peoples Wealth which he levieth from them; for supposing the People are equally Rich; if one of the Sovereigns levy fifth part, and the other fifteenth, the one seems actually thrice as Rich as the other, whereas potentially they are both equal.</P>
<P>Having now dicoursed of the Territory, People, Superlucration and defensibleness of both Dominions, and in some measure of the Trade, so far as we had occasion to mention Ships, Shipping and nearness to Ports, we come next to enlarge a little further upon the Trade of each, some have esti∣mated that there are not above three hun∣dred
<PB N="69" REF="370"/>
Millions of people in the whole World, whether that be so or no is not very material to be known; but I have fairer Ground to conjecture, and would be glad to have it more certainly, that there are not above eighty thousand with whom the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have commerce, no <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI> I know of Trading directly or in∣directly where they do not so as the whole commercial World or World of Trade con∣sists of eighty thousand of Souls as afore∣said.</P>
<P>And I further estimate that the value of all the Commodities, yearly exchanged a∣mong them, does not exceed fourty five thousand; now the Wealth of every Nati∣on consisting chiefly in the share which they have in forreign Trade with the whole com∣mercial World; rather then in the Do∣mestick Trade of ordinary Meat, Drink, Cloth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And which brings in little Gold, Silver, Pearls and other universal Wealth; we are to consider the Subjects of the King of <HI>England</HI> (Head for Head) have not a greater share hereof then those of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>To which purpose it has been consider∣ed that the manufactures of Wool, yearly exported out of <HI>England</HI> into sevesal parts of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> all sorts of Cloth,
<PB N="70" REF="371"/>
Serg, Stuff, Cotton Bayes, Frize, or also Stockens, Caps, Rugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> exported out of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; do amount unto five hundred thousand pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>The value of Lead, Tin and Coals, to five hundred thousand pound.</P>
<P>The value of all Cloths, Houshold-Stuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> carried into <HI>America</HI> two hundred thousand pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>Silver and Gold taken from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sixty thousand pound.</P>
<P>The value of Sugar, Indico, Tobacco, Cottham, and Catao from the Southward part of <HI>America</HI> six hundred thousand pound.</P>
<P>The value of Wool, Butter, Hides, Beef, Herrings, Pilchers, Salmon, exported out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> eight hundred thousand pound.</P>
<P>The value of Coals, Salt, Linnen, Yarn Herrings, Pilchers, Salmon, brought out of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> five hundred thousand pound.</P>
<P>The value of Salt-Peter, Pepper, Calli∣cots, Diamonds, Drugs, and Silks, brought out of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> above what was spent in <HI>England,</HI> eight hundred thousand pound.</P>
<P>The value of Slaves brought out of <HI>A∣frica</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="371"/>
to serve in the <HI>American</HI> Plantation twenty thousand; which with the freight of the English Shipping Trading into for∣reign parts being above fifteen hundred thousand makes in all Ten Millions and a hundred and eighty thousand.</P>
<P>Which computation is sufficiently justi∣fied by the Customs of three Kingdoms, whose intrinsick value are thought to be near about one Million <HI>per Annum: viz.</HI> Six hundred thousand Payable to the King, one hundred thousand for the charge of collecting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> two hundred thousand Smackled by the Merchants, and one hun∣dred thousand gained by the Farmers, ac∣cording to the common opinion and men saying; and this agrees also with that pro∣portion or part of the Trade of the whole World, which I have estimated the Subjects of the King of <HI>England</HI> to be possessed of, <HI>viz.</HI> for about Ten of forty five Millions; but the value of the <HI>French</HI> commodities brought into <HI>England</HI> (notwithstanding Mr. <HI>Fortree</HI>'s estimates) are not above twelve hundred thousand <HI>per Annum,</HI> and the value of all the export into all the World besides not above three or four times as much, which computation also agrees well enough with the accompt we have of the Customs of <HI>France</HI>; so as <HI>France</HI> not exporting above
<PB N="72" REF="372"/>
half the value of what <HI>England</HI> does, and for the commodities of <HI>France</HI> except Wines, Brandy, Paper, and the first Patterns and Fashions for Cloths and furniture, of which <HI>France</HI> is the mint, are imitable by the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and having withal more people then <HI>Eng∣land</HI> it follows that the people of <HI>England &amp;c.</HI> have Head for Head, near thrice as much forreign Trade as the people of <HI>France,</HI> and above two parts of nine of the Trade of the whole commercial World, and 2/7 of all the Shipping; notwithstanding all which is not to be denied that the King, and some great men of <HI>France,</HI> appear more Rich and splendid then those or the like quality in <HI>England</HI>; all which arises, rather from the nature of their Government, then from the intrinsick and natural cause of Wealth and Power.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="75" REF="372"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V. That the Impediments of <HI>England</HI>'s Greatness are contingent and remo∣vable.</HEAD>
<P>THe first impediment of Englands Great∣ness is, the Territories thereunto be∣longing are too far asunder and divided by the Sea into so many several Islands and Countries; and I may say into so many Kingdoms and different Governments, <HI>viz.</HI> There be three distinct Legislative Powers in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the which of instead of uniting together do often cross one and others Interest, putting Bars and Impediments upon one and others Trades; not only as they were forraigners to each other, but sometimes as Enemies.</P>
<P>The Islands of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Guernsey</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Man</HI> are under jurisdictions diffe∣rent from those either of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The Government of <HI>New-England</HI> (both civil and Ecclesiastical) do so differ from
<PB N="76" REF="373"/>
that of his Majesties other Dominions, that it is hard to say what may be the Consequence of it.</P>
<P>And the Government of the other Plan∣tations do also differ very much from any of the West, altho there be naturally sub∣stantial Reasons for the Situation, Trade and Condition of the People, why there should be such differences; from all which it comes to pass the small divided remote Governments being seldom able to defend themselves, the Burthen of the Protecting them all, must lye upon the chiefest King∣dom of <HI>England</HI>; and all the small King∣doms and Dominions, instead of being addi∣tions, are really diminutions.</P>
<P>The Wealth of a King is three-Fold, one is the Wealth of Subjects, the second is the quota parts of his Subjects Wealth given him for the Publick Defence, Honour and Ornaments of the people, and to man∣age such undertakings for the common good as no one, or a few private men, are suffi∣cient for.</P>
<P>The third sort are the quota of the last mentioned quota parts which the King may dispose of as his own Personal inclination and discretion shall direct; now it is most manifest that the aforementioned distance and differences of Kingdoms, and jurisdicti∣ons,
<PB N="77" REF="373"/>
are great impediments to all the said several sorts of Wealth, as may be seen in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. In case of War with forraign Na∣tions, <HI>England</HI> commonly beareth the whole Burthen and charge, whereby many in <HI>England</HI> are utterly undone.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>England</HI> sometimes prohibiting the Commodities of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> (as of late it did the Cattle, Flesh, and Fish, of <HI>Ireland,</HI>) did not only make Food, and con∣sequently Labour, dearer in <HI>England,</HI> but also has forced the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> to fetch these commodities from <HI>France, Holland</HI> and other places which before was sold them from <HI>England,</HI> to the great Prejudice of both Nations.</P>
<P N="3">3. It occasions an unnecessary trouble and charge in collecting of Customs upon Commodities passing between the several Nations.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a dammage to our <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and other American Trades, that the Goods, which might pass thence immediately to se∣veral parts of the World, and be sold at moderate Rates, must first come into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and there pay Duties, and afterwards (if at all) passing to those Countries whi∣ther they might have gone immediately.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Islands of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Guernsey</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="374"/>
are protected at the charge of <HI>England,</HI> nevertheless the Labour and Industry of that People (which is very great) redound most to the profit of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. In <HI>New-England</HI> there are vast num∣bers of able Bodied English-men imployed chiefly in Husbandry, and in the meanest part of it (which is) breeding of Cattle, whereas <HI>Ireland</HI> would have contained all those Persons, at the worst would have afforded them Lands in better Terms then they have them in <HI>America,</HI> if not some other better Trade withal, then now they can have.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Inhabitants of the other Plan∣tations, altho they do indeed Plant commo∣dities which will not grow so well in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> it grasping at more Land then it will suffice to produce the said exotics in a suf∣ficient quantity to serve the whole World, they do therein but distract and confound the effects of their own Indeavours.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is no doubt that the same peo∣ple far and wide dispersed must spend more upon their Government and Protection then the same living compactly, and when they have no occasion to depend upon the Wind, Weather, and all the Accidents of the Sea.</P>
<P>A second impediment to the greatness of <HI>England,</HI> is the different understanding of
<PB N="79" REF="374"/>
several material points, <HI>viz.</HI> The Kings Prerogative, Priviledges of Parliament, the obscure differences between Law and Equity, as also between Civil and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, doubts whether the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> has Power over the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> besides the wonderful Paradox, that the English-men lawfully sent to suppress Rebells in <HI>Ireland</HI> should (after having ef∣fected the same) be (as it were) disfran∣chised, and loose that interest in the Legis∣lative Power which they had in <HI>England,</HI> and pay Customes as forraingers for all they spend in <HI>Ireland,</HI> whither they were sent for the Honour and Benefit of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>The third impediment is that <HI>Ireland</HI> be∣ing a conquered Country, and containing not the Tenth part of as many <HI>Irish</HI> Mastives as there are <HI>English</HI> in both Kingdoms, that natural and firm Union is not made between the two Peoples by Transplantation and proportionable Mixture, so as there may be a Tenth part of <HI>Irish</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the same Proportion in <HI>England,</HI> whereby the necessity of maintaining an Army in <HI>England</HI> at the expence of the quarter of all the Rents of that Kingdom may be taken away.</P>
<P>The fourth impediment is that the Taxes in <HI>England</HI> are not levied upon the expen∣ces,

but the whole Estate, not upon Lands, Stock and Labour, but chiefly upon Land alone, and that not by any equal and indifferent Standard, but the casual Predo∣minacy of Parties and Factions; and moreo∣ver that these Taxes are not levied with the least trouble and charge, but let out to Far∣mers, who also let them from one to ano∣ther without explicit knowledge of what they do, but so are to conclude the poor people pay twice as much as the King re∣ceives.</P>
<P>Now the fifth impediment is the inequa∣lity of Shires, Diocesses, Parishes, Church-livings, and other Precincts, as also of the Representations of the people in Parliament, all which do hinder the operations of Au∣thority, in the same manner as a Wheel irregularly made, and excentrically hung neither moves so easily, nor performs it's work so timely, as if the same were duly framed and poised.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whether it be an impediment that the Power of making War and raising money be not in the same hand much may be said; but that I leave to those who may more properly meddle with Fundamental Laws. None of these impediments are natural but did arise as the irregularities of Buildings do by being built part at one time and
<PB N="81" REF="375"/>
part at another, and by the changing of the State of things from what they were at the respective times, when the Practice we com∣plained of were first admitted, and perhaps are but the warpings from the rectitude of the first institution.</P>
<P>As these Impediments are contingent so they are also removable, for may not the Land of Superfluous Territories be sold, and the people with their moveables be brought away? may not the <HI>English</HI> in the <HI>American</HI> Plantations who Plant Tobacco, Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> compute what Land will serve their turns, and then contract their Habita∣tions to that proportion, for quantity and quality? As for the people of <HI>New England</HI> I can but wish they were Transplanted in∣to old-<HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> according to Pro∣posals of their own, made within this twen∣ty Years, altho they were allowed more li∣berty of Conscience then they allow one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>May not the three Kingdoms be united into one, and equally represented in Parlia∣ment? might not the several Species of the Kings Subjects be equally mixt in their ha∣bitations? might not Parishes and other Pre∣cincts be better equaliz'd? might not juris∣dictions and Pretences of Powers be deter∣mined and ascertained? might not Taxes be
<PB N="82" REF="376"/>
equally aplotted and directly applyed, to their ultimate use? might not dissenters in Religion be indulged, they paying a com∣petent force to keep the Publick-Peace? I humbly venture to say all these things may be done; if it be thought fit by the Sove∣raign Power, because the like has often and Succesfully been done already at Several Places, and Times.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. That the Power and Wealth of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> has increased these last forty Years.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not much to be doubted but that the Territories under the Kings Dominions have increased, for as much as <HI>New-Eng∣land, Virginy, Barbados,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica, Tangier,</HI> and <HI>Bombay,</HI> have since that time been ei∣ther added to his Majesties Territories, or improved from a desert condition to abound with the People, Building, Shipping, and the Production of many useful commodi∣ties.
<PB N="83" REF="376"/>
And as for the Land of <HI>England, Scot∣land</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> as it is not less in quantity then it was forty Years since, so it is mani∣fest, that by Reason of dreining of Fens, Watering of dry Grounds, improving of Forrests, and Commons, making of Heaths and barren Grounds to bear Cinquefole, and Clovergrass, meliorating and multi∣plying several sorts of Fruits and Garden-stuff, making some Rivers Navigable, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I say it is manifest, that the Land in it's present condition is able to bear more pro∣vision and commodities then it was forty Years ago.</P>
<P N="2">2. Altho the People of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which have Extraordinarily Perished by the Plague and Sword with∣in this last forty Years, do amount to about three hundred thousand, above what have dyed in the ordinary way, yet the ordina∣ry increase by Generation of Ten Millions, which doubles in two hundred Years, as has been shewn by the observations upon the Bills of Mortality, may in forty Years (which is a fifth part of the said Time) have increased near a fifth part of the whole number or two Millions. Where note by the way, that the accession of <HI>Negroes</HI> to the <HI>A∣merican</HI> Plantations, being all men of great Labour and little Expence, is not considera∣ble.
<PB N="84" REF="377"/>
Besides it is hoped that <HI>New-England,</HI> where few or no Women are Barren, and must have many Children, and where peo∣ple live long and Healthfully, has produ∣ced an increase of as many people as were destroyed in the late tumults in <HI>Ireland.</HI> As for Housing these Streets of <HI>London</HI> it self speaks it, I conceive it double in value in that City to what it was forty Years since; and for Housing in the Country, they have increased at <HI>Bristol, New-Castle, Yarmouth, Norwich, Exeter, Portsmouth, Cowes, Dublin, Kingsale, Londondary, Coolervin</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> far beyond the Proportion of what I can learn has been dilapidated in other places; for in <HI>Ireland</HI> where the ruine was greatest, (the Housing taken altogether) is now more valuable then forty Years ago; nor is this to be doubted, since Housing is now more splendid then in those days, and the number of Dwellers is increased by near a fifth part, as in the last Paragraph is set forth.</P>
<P>As for Shipping, his Majesties Navy is now triple, or quadruple to what it was forty Years since, and before the Sove∣raign was Built; the Shipping-Trading to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> which are now about eighty thousand Tuns could not then be above a quarter of that quantity; first because the
<PB N="85" REF="377"/>
City of <HI>London</HI> is doubled; secondly be∣cause the use of Coal is also at least dou∣bled, because they were heretofore sel∣dom used in Chambers as now they are; nor were there so many Bricks Burned with them as of late, nor did the Coun∣try on both sides the <HI>Thames</HI> make use of them as now; besides, there are imployed in the <HI>Guinny</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Trades above forty thousand Tun of Shipping, which Trade in those days was inconsiderable, the quantity of Wines imported was not near so much as now, and to be short, the Customs upon imported and exported com∣modities did not then yield a third part of the present Value; which shews, that not only Shipping, but Trade it self has in∣creased somewhat near that Propor∣tion. As to money the interest thereof, was within these fifty Years at Ten pound <HI>per cent.</HI> forty Years ago at eight pound, and now at six pound, no thanks to any Laws which have been made to that purpose; for as much as those who can give good security may now have it less, but the natural fall of interest, is the effect of the increase of money.</P>
<P>Moreover if Rented Lands and Houses have increased, and if Trade has increased also, it is certain that money, which pay∣eth
<PB N="86" REF="378"/>
those Rents and driveth on Trade, must have increased also.</P>
<P>Lastly I leave it to the consideration of all observers, whether the number and Splendor of Coaches, Equipage, and Hous∣hold Furniture have not increased since that time. To say nothing of the postage of Letters, which have increased from one to twenty, which argues the increase of Business and Negotiation; I must add that his Majesties Revenues is near tri∣ple, and therefore the means to pay and Bear the same has increased also.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. That one tenth Part of the whole ex∣pence of the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Sub∣jects is sufficient to maintain one hundred thousand Foot, forty thou∣sand Horse, and forty thousand men at Sea, and defray all other Charges of the Government; both ordinary, and extraordinary, if the same were re∣gularly Taxed and raised.</HEAD>
<P>TO clear this point we are to find out what is the middle Expence of each Head in the Kings Dominions between the highest and the lowest; to which I say it is not probably less then the Expence of a Labourer, who earns about eight pence a day, for the wages of such men is four Shillings a Week without Victuals, or two Shillings with it; wherefore the value of his Victuals is two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week, or five pound four Shillings <HI>per Annum.</HI> Now the value of Cloaths can't be less then wages given to the Poorest Maid-Servant in the
<PB N="88" REF="379"/>
Country, which is thirty Shillings <HI>per An∣num,</HI> nor can the charge of all other neces∣saries be less then six Shillings <HI>per Annum</HI> more, wherefore the whole charge is seven pound.</P>
<P>It is not likely that this Discourse will fall into the Hands of any that lives at se∣ven pound <HI>per Annum</HI>; and therefore such will wonder at this Supposition; but if they consider how much the number of the Poor and their Children is greater, then that of the Rich, altho the personal Expence of some Rich men should be above twenty times more then that of a Labourer; yet the expence of a Labourer above menti∣oned, may well enough stand for the Stan∣dard of the expence of the whole Mass of Mankind.</P>
<P>Now if the expence of each man one with another be seven pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> and if the number of the Kings Subjects be Ten thousand; then the tenth part of the whole Expence will be seven thousand; but about five thousand, or a very little more will amount to a years pay for one hundred thou∣sand Foot; forty thousand Horse, and forty thousand men at Sea, Winter and Summer, which can rarely be necessary, and other ordinary charge of the Government in the time of deep and secute peace was not 600000 <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="379"/>Where a People thrive there the In∣come is greater then the Expence; and consequently the tenth part of the Expence is not the tenth part of the Income. Now for men to pay a tenth part of their ex∣pence in a time of greatest exigency (for such it must be when so great forces is re∣quisite) can be no hardship, much less a de∣plorable conditon, for to bear the tenth part, a man must needs spend a twentyeth part less, and Labour a twentieth part more for half an hour <HI>per diem</HI> extraordinary; both which in common Experience are very Tolerable, here being very few in <HI>England,</HI> who do not eat by a twentieth part more then does them good: and what Misery were it, instead of wearing Cloaths of twen∣ty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard to be contented with that of nineteen Shillings, few men having skill enough to discern the difference?</P>
<P><HI>Memorandum</HI> that all this while, I sup∣pose all of these Ten thousand of people are obedient to their Soveraign, and within the reach of his Power, for as things are otherwise, so the Calculation must be varied.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. That there are spare Hands enough a∣mongst the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Sub∣jects to earn two Millions <HI>per An∣num</HI> more then they now do, and that there are also Imployments ready, proper and sufficient, for the purpose.</HEAD>
<P>TO prove this point, we must inquire how much all the People could earn if they were disposed or necessitated to La∣bour, and had work whereupon to imploy themselves, and compare the Summ with that of the Total Expence abovemention∣ed; deducting the Rents and profit of their Land and Stock, which properly speaking saveth so much Labour. Now the proceed of the said Land and Stock in these Countries is about three parts of seven of the whole Expence; so as where the expence is seventy thousand, the Rent of the Land and profit of all Personal Estate, interest of money <HI>&amp;c.</HI> must be about thirty thousand, and consequently the value of the Labour forty
<PB N="91" REF="380"/>
thousand; that is, four pound <HI>per</HI> Head; but it is to be noted, that about a quar∣ter of the Mass of Mankind are Children Males and Females under seven Years old, from whom little Labour is to be expected; it is also to be noted that about another tenth part of the whole people are such as by Reason of their great Estates, Tythes, Dignities, Offices, and professions are ex∣empt from that kind of Labour; we now speak of their business being or ought to be to Govern, Regulate, and direct the La∣bours and Actions of others, so that of Ten Millions there be about six thousand &amp; a half, or two thirds which if need requires might actually Labour, and of these some might earn three Shillings a Week, some five Shil∣lings and some seven Shillings, that is, all of them might earn five Shillings a Weak at a <HI>medium</HI> one with another, or at least Ten pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> allowing for Sickness and other Accidents whereby the whole might earn fifty six thousand pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> that is, twenty five more then the Ex∣pence.</P>
<P>The Author of the State of <HI>England</HI> saies that the Children of <HI>Norwich</HI> between six and sixteen Years old do earn twelve thousand pound <HI>per Annum</HI> more then they spend. Now for as much as the people of <HI>Norwich</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="381"/>
are a three hundredth part of all the peo∣ple in <HI>England</HI> (as appears by the Accompt of Hearth-money) and about the five hundredth part of all the Kings Subjects throughout the World, it follows that all his Majesties Subjects between six and six∣teen Years old might earn five thousand <HI>per Annum</HI> more then they spend. Again forasmuch as the number of People above sixteen Years old are double the number of those between six and sixteen, and that of each men can earn double to each of the Children, it is plain that if the men and Children every where did do as they do in <HI>Norwich</HI> they might earn twenty five thou∣sand pound <HI>per Annum</HI> more then they spend; which estimate grounded upon matter of Fact and Experience, agrees with the for∣mer.</P>
<P>Altho as has been proved the people of <HI>England</HI> do thrive, and that 'tis possible they might Superlucrate twenty five thousand pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> yet 'tis manifest they do not nor twenty three which is less by two thousand herein meant; for if they did Su∣perlucrate twenty five thousand, then in a∣bout five or six Years time the whole Stock and Personal Estate of the Nation would be double, which I wish were true, but find no manner of Reason to believe; where∣fore
<PB N="93" REF="381"/>
if they can Superlucrate twenty five, but not actually Superlucrate twenty three, nor twenty, nor ten, nor perhaps five, I have then proved what was propounded, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are spare hands among the Kings Subjects to earn two Millions more then they now do.</P>
<P>But to speak a little more particularly concerning this matter, it is to be noted, that since the fire of <HI>London,</HI> there was earned in four Years by Tradesmen (re∣lating to building only) the Summ of four Millions, or one Million <HI>per Annum</HI> with∣out lessening any other sort of Work La∣bour or Manufacture, which was usually done in other four Years before the said occasion; but if the Tradesmen relating to Building only, and such of them as wrought in and about <HI>London</HI> could do one Milli∣on-worth of Work extraordinary, I think that from thence and from what has been said before, that all the rest of the spare Hands might very well double the same, which is as much as was propounded. Now if there were spare Hands to Superlucrate Millions of Millions, they signifie nothing un∣less there were Imployment for them, &amp; may as well follow their Pleasures and Specu∣lation as Labour to no purpose; therefore the more material point is to prove that
<PB N="94" REF="382"/>
there is two Millionsw-orth of Work to be done, which at the present the Kings Subjects do neglect.</P>
<P>For the proof of this there needs little more to be done than to compute how much money is paid by the King of <HI>Eng∣lands</HI> Subjects to Forreingers for freight of Shipping.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> gain by their Fishing-Trade Practised upon our Seas.</P>
<P N="3">3. What the value of all the commo∣dities imported into and sent into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> which might by diligence be produ∣ed and Manufactured, here to make short of this matter upon perusal of the most authentick accompts relating to these se∣veral particulars I affirm that the same a∣mounteth to above five Millions whereof I propounded but two Millions.</P>
<P>For a further proof whereof Mr. <HI>Samu∣el Fortry</HI> in his ingenious discourse of Trade exhibited the particulars, wherein it ap∣pears that the Goods imported out of <HI>France</HI> only amount yearly to 2600,000. pounds, and I affirm that the Wines, Pa∣per, Cork, Rosin, and Capers, and a few other Commodities which <HI>England</HI> can't produce, do not amount to one fifth part of the said Summ; from whence it follows that (if Mr. <HI>Fortry</HI> has not erred) the
<PB N="95" REF="382"/>
two Millions here mentioned may arise from <HI>France</HI> alone, and consequently five or six Millions from all the three Heads last above specifyed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. That there is money sufficient to drive the Trade of the Nation.</HEAD>
<P>SInce his Majesties happy Restauration it was thought fit to call i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and now Coyn the money which was made it the times of Usurpation. Now it was observed by the general consent of Casheers that the said money (being by frequent revoluti∣ons well mixed with the Gold) was about a seventh part thereof, and that the said money being called in was about 800,000. pound, and consequently the whole 5600,000. pound or five Millions and a half, whereby 'tis probable (that some allowance being given for hoarded money) the whole Cash of <HI>England</HI> was then about six Millions, which I conceive is sufficient to drive the
<PB N="96" REF="383"/>
Trade of <HI>England,</HI> not but that the rest of his Majesties Dominions have the like means to do the same respective fully.</P>
<P>If there be six Millions of Souls in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and that each spendeth seven pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> then the whole expence is forty two Millions or about 800,000. pounds <HI>per</HI> Week; and consequently if every man did pay his expence Weekly and that the money could circulate within the compass of a Week, then less then one Million could answer the ends proposed. But for∣asmuch as the Rents of the Lands in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> which are paid half yearly are eight Millions <HI>per Annum,</HI> there must be four Mil∣lions to pay them; and forasmuch as the Rent of Housing of <HI>England</HI> paid quarterly are worth about four Millions <HI>per Annum,</HI> there needs but one Million to pay the said Rent; wherefore six Millions being enough to make good the three sorts of Circulation above mentioned, I conceive what was pro∣posed is proved, at least till something better be held forth to the contrary.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="97" REF="383"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. That the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Subjects have Stock competent and convenient to drive the Trade of the whole com∣mercial World.</HEAD>
<P>NOw for the further Incouragement of Trade, as we have shewn, that there is Money enough in <HI>England</HI> to manage the affairs thereof, so we shall now offer to con∣sideration whether there be not competent and convenient Stock to drive the Trade of the whole commercial World. To which purpose it is to be remembred, that all the Commodities yearly exported out of every part of the last mentioned World, may be bought for forty five Millions, and that the Shipping imployed in the same World are not worth above fifteen Millions, and con∣sequently that sixty Millions at most will drive the whole Trade abovementioned without any trust at all; but forasmuch as the Grovers of Commodities do commonly trust them to such Merchants or Factors as are worth but such a part of the
<PB N="98" REF="384"/>
full value of their Commodities as may possibly be lost upon the sail of them which is rather to be expected; it follows then less then a Stock of sixty Millions, nay then half of the said Summ is sufficient to drive the Trade above mentioned; it being well known that any Tradesemen of good Reputation worth five hundred pound will be trusted with above one thousand pounds-worth of Commodities, where less then thir∣ty Millions will suffice for the said purpose, of which Summ the Coyn, Shipping and Stock already in Trade do at least make one half.</P>
<P>And it has been shewn how by the Poli∣cy of a Bank any Summ of money may be made equivalent in Trade unto near the double of the same. By all which it seems that even at present much is not wanting to perform what is propounded; but sup∣pose twenty thousand or more were want∣ing, it is not improbable that since the ge∣nerality of Gentlemen and some Noble-men do put their Younger Sons to Merchandise, that they will see it reasonable as they in∣crease in the number of Merchants so to in∣crease the Magnitude of Trade, and conse∣quently to increase Stock; which may effectu∣ally be done by in-banking twenty Mil. worth of Land not being above a sixth or seventh part of the whole Territories of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="384"/>
that is to say, by making a Bond of such value, to the security for all Commodi∣ties bought and sold, upon the account of that Universal Trade above menti∣oned.</P>
<P>And thus it having appeared, that <HI>Eng∣land</HI> having in it as much Land, like <HI>Hol∣land</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> as the said two Pro∣vinces do themselves contain, with abun∣dance of other Land, not inconvenient for Trade, and that there are spare Hands enough to earn many Millions of money, more then they now do; and that there are also Imployments to earn se∣veral Millions (even from the Consumpti∣on of <HI>England</HI> it self) it follows from▪ thence, and what has been said in the last Pa∣ragraph about inlarging of the Stock both of Monies and Lands, that it is not impossible, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very visible matter for the keeping of <HI>Englands</HI> Subjects, to gain the Universal Trade of the whole Com∣mercial World.</P>
<P>Nor is it unseasonable to imitate this matter, forasmuch as the younger Bro∣thers of good Families of <HI>England,</HI> can't otherwise be provided for▪ so as to live according to their Birth and Breeding; for if the Lands of <HI>England</HI> are worth
<PB N="100" REF="385"/>
eight Millions <HI>per Annum,</HI> then there be at a Medium about ten Millions. Fami∣lies of about eight hundred pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> in each of which one with ano∣ther, we may suppose there is a young∣er Brother, who in less then two or three hundred pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> will not main∣tain suitable to his Relations. Now I say that if neither the Offices at Court, nor Commands in our ordinary Army and Na∣vy, nor Church-preferments, nor the u∣sual gain by the profession of Law and Physick; nor the imployments under No∣ble-men, and Prelates will all of them put together furnish Livelyhood of above three hundred pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> to three thousand of the said one thousand younger Brothers, wherefore it remains that Trade alone must supply the rest; but <HI>if</HI> the said seven thousand Gentlemen be apply∣ed to Trade, without increasing of Trade, or if the hopes to increase Trade with∣out increasing of Stock (which for ought appears is only to be done by in-Banking a due proportion of Lands and Money) we must necessarily be disappointed: where note that selling of Lands to Forraign∣ers, for Gold and Silver, would inlarge the Stock of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="385"/>Whereas doing the same between one and other does effect nothing, for he that turns all his Land into Money, dis∣poses himself for Trade, and he that parts with his money for Land does the contrary, but to sell Land to Forreigners increaseth both money and people, and consequently Trade; wherefore it is to be thought, that when the Laws denying Strangers to purchase, and not permit∣ing them to Trade without paying Ex∣traordinary Duties, were made, that then the Publick State of things, and Interest of the Nation were far different from what they now are.</P>
<P>Having handled these ten Principal Conclusions, I might go on with others <HI>ad infinitum</HI>; but what has been said already, I look upon as sufficient to shew what I mean by Political Arithmetick, and to e∣vince the uses of knowledge of the true State of the Peoples Lands, Stock, Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Secondly that the Kings Subjects are not in so bad a Condition, as dis∣contented men would make them; Third∣ly to Demonstrate the greatest effects of Unity, Industry, and Obedience, in or∣der

to the common Safety, and each mans particular Happiness, other then which I have now.</P>
