<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THou art here presented with The Present Pro∣spect of the Island of <HI>Tobago,</HI>
about forty Leagues distant from <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but far excelling that Island, and indeed
any other of the Caribee-Islands, in the Fertility and Richness of the Soil, and in the
Commodiousness of its Bays and Harbors: And it is no Paradox to affirm, That though it lies
<HI>more South,</HI> the <HI>Air</HI> is as <HI>Cool</HI> and <HI>Refreshing</HI> as that of
<HI>Barba∣does:</HI> and yet Exempted from those affrighting and destructive
<HI>Hurricanes</HI> that have been often Fatal to the rest of the <HI>Caribee</HI>-Islands.</P>
<P>Nor is it unfurnished with any thing necessary for the Sustenance and Preservation of
Humane Life; as you will see by the Ensuing Prospect of it, in which there is nothing set
down but what will be attested by several that have been upon the Island, and what thou wilt
find there, if Providence should bring thee thither: For there is variety enough of the real
Products of the Island to di∣late upon, without Interlarding it with fictitious Stories:</P>
<PB REF="3"/>
<P>And I am perswaded there is no Island in <HI>America,</HI> that can afford us more ample
Subjects to contemplate the Bounty and Goodness of our Great Creator in, than this of
<HI>Tobago;</HI> And this I speak not by hearsay, or as one that has liv'd always at home; but
as one that has had Experience of the World, and been in the greatest Part of the
<HI>Caribee</HI>-Islands, and most parts of the Conti∣nent of <HI>America,</HI> and almost
all his Majesties For∣reign Plantations; and after having view'd them all, have chosen this
Island of <HI>Tobago</HI> to take up my <HI>Qui∣etus est</HI> in.</P>
<P>To which end I have purchased a Grant from the Duke of <HI>Courland</HI> (to whom by vertue of
an Agree∣ment with His present Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the said Island does
solely belong) of <HI>120000</HI> Acres of the said Island for my self and Company, upon very
Advan∣tagious Conditions, for which I refer thee to the Proposals at the end of the Book; and to
the Grant it self, in my own Custody; Being very willing to give all reasonable Satisfaction
to those whose hearts shall incline to settle there.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Present Prospect OF TOBAGO: WITH</HI> A Description of the Situation,
Fertility, Growth and Manufacture of that Island.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I design only to describe the Flou∣rishing Island of <HI>Tobago,</HI> so I
re∣solve by the Methods I have taken, not to build the <HI>Porch</HI> too big for the
<HI>House:</HI> For that end let this small Introduction admit you to a Prospect of
<HI>Tobago,</HI> which is a Sub∣ject that needs no Encomium to il∣lustrate so fertile a Soil as
deservedly may speak her own Praise, because consented to by most that have known her,
to vye with the Glory of all the <HI>Caribes:</HI> So that I approve it convenient she be heard
to speak, and in her own Dialect too; then upon Exa∣min by those that consult her, she'll
be found to evince the Incredulous beyond suspicion.</P>
<P>And since in the Frontispiece I have promised to in∣troduct
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>you to the Situation of the Island, I do it by telling you that it lies in
Eleven Degrees Thirty Mi∣nutes North-Latitude, and in Fifty Three Degrees Six Minutes Longitude,
West from the <HI>Lizard;</HI> and about Forty Leagues distant from the flourishing
<HI>Barbados,</HI> as Captain <HI>Lloyd</HI> asserts in his Breviat; who also affirms it the
most Convenient, Commodious, and Salubrious Island in the <HI>Caribes;</HI> and truly so it
may, being so sweet∣ly tempered with those moderate and Soveraign Breezes of Wind that
refresh the Planter by Day, and purges the Air by Night: So that the Day-Breez springs by
fa∣vour from the Ocean, and rises with the Sun, as does the Night-Breez refresh by softer
Gales, sent from her Rocks and Mountanous Elevations. Nor is the rage of a Tempest at any time
heard to dread the Inhabitants, nor the terror of a Hurricane ever known to invade them; which of
all things is most dreadful, and con∣sequently most fatal, to the rest of the
<HI>Caribes;</HI> this be∣ing the Southermost Island (and nearest to the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Coast) which no Hurricane has hitherto invaded, as ever was heard of by any of the Inhabitants.
How∣ever it exceeds not Thirty two miles in Length, and I should err to say more then Eleven in
Breadth; which disproportion is sufficiently recompenc'd by the Natu∣ral Scituation of the Bays
and the Harbours for Shipping; as are the Rivers, Rivulets, &amp; larger Openings convenient for
Navigating of Sloops and smaller Vessels, whereby to furnish the Inhabitants, and commode
them for desence.</P>
<P>Inasmuch therefore as by reason of her Fertility she acquires to her self the Sirname of
<HI>Fortunate,</HI> except otherwise the <HI>Dutch</HI> superscribe her Unfortunate, when,
because to involve them in her Redolent Em∣bracements, or to invite forreign Princes to emulate
their Prosperity: However at present she lives in peace,
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y"/>and to out-live her troubles, and by the Provi∣dence of God sleeps in
the Arms of Security; whose Soil is so rich without Art or Cultivation, that some have
fancied her the <HI>Paradise</HI> of the <HI>Indies;</HI> drest up in a beauteous Complexion of
Soil, that represents in some parts a most pleasant Redness, whilst to admiration in
other places it shines with Blackness; and because min∣gled for the most part with a Marley
Substance, pene∣trates the Earth a considerable depth; which evidently proves by convincing
Argument, the prodigious growth of her massy and ponderous Timber-Trees, of which we shall
speak in their proper Classis; as also of the Natural Plenty and Produce of Provision,
the Delicacy of Fruits, and the Soveraign Vertue of Roots, Herbs, Flowers, and Medicinal Drugs;
besides Natures Boun∣ty in Variety of Beasts, and Heavens Benediction in the multiplication of
Fish and Fowl, that abound both in fresh and in salt Water; which because of another
Or∣der, will the rather admit of a distinct Discourse: So the Staple of the Island, and the
Natural Product, will give us an occasion to offer it somewhere else.</P>
<P>But the Planters and the Inhabitants present a new Prospect; whose Charge will be much
lessned to those that live Northwardly, by reason of a warm yet tempe∣rate Heat, because
moderated by a continued Breez of Wind; So that here's no Summer spent on purpose to accumulate
or heap up Provision for Winters Accom∣modation; because all the year long both Herbage and
Fruits sprout and bud up by a perpetual Spring; and the Warmth in it self so natural to
nourish Age, as is the Germinating (or budding) Spring to give encou∣ragement to Youth. And the
Island is so replenish'd with materials for Building, that provided you bring dextrous Hands
and good Artificers, you may in a lit∣tle
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>Time, and with sinall Charge, build both Houses and Towns, or
Fortifications.</P>
<P>The next thing to consult is, The Growth and Ma∣nufacture of the Countrey, improvable by
Industry, and the Mediums of Art; which will fall in course at the Opening of Individuals; so
that we may proceed to the several particulars, referring the Reader for satis∣faction to the
Proposals, if desirous to consult the Grant, Government, Religion, Liberty of Conscience,
the Settlement, Insurance, Accommodation, Factories, Shipping, and Encouragement for
Transportation; which is fully exprest, without Fraud or Ambiguity.</P>
<DIV2 N="grain" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of GRAIN.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst therefore let us begin with <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> which is either such as grows in
<HI>Virginia, New-York, Caro∣lina,</HI> &amp;c. and so proceed to <HI>Guiney-Corn,</HI> or any
other that hath growth in the Island. But I shall delude you if to tell you that <HI>English
Grain</HI> grows here: However there are English Pease, and of various sorts; and Beans, and
Pulse enough, as you may observe if you please, by the ensuing Discourse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian-Corn</HI> buds, and grows out with a small stem upon a strong stalk,
(which stalk they burn in <HI>Barbados</HI> under their Coppers in Crop-time, to boil up their
Sugar) and has a fibrous or stringy Root; some of it brings one Ear, some two, and some
others three: But the green Leaves in most of the <HI>Caribe</HI> Isles, they fre∣quently
strip off, and give them to their Cattel. Of this sort of Corn, you may expect at least two,
if not three Crops yearly, to a very great Increase; whereof
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>very good Bread is made; and with indifferent Art, a most delicate Drink.</P>
<P>The <HI>Guiney-Corn</HI> is much of the figure and the nature of <HI>Rice;</HI> save onely
<HI>Rice</HI> has a slender stalk, and a smal∣ler Ear, and grows in Swamps and moist
Bottoms; but this will grow on the Tops of Rocks, and produce its Increase upon any Soil. The
stalk is strong, very large and tall; and the Corn sprouts forth on the top, or ex∣treamest
part of the stalk, (it has a fibrous Root) and augments to a prodigious increase; for one Grain
by natural Product, without the Art of Cultivation, mul∣tiplies of it self into many thousands.
Of this they make Bread, Dumplins, and Puddings; and some hull it like <HI>Rice,</HI> and boil it
with Milk.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bonivis</HI> represents the shape of a Pea, save only its some what longer;
which if once put into the ground, the Art of Man can hardly destroy it; for it seldom dies,
but continually buds, and blossoms, ac∣commodating the Planter with green, and ripe Pease all
the year about. Nor think I them inferiour to the best of <HI>French Beans,</HI> if indifferently
boiled, and eaten with sweet Butter; but then it must be while they are green and tender; for
when they are ripe, their Case or Rind turns white; which if dried, and as other Pulse boiled,
are eaten with Pork, and are a Nourishing Food.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>French Pea,</HI> so much admired in <HI>Martinego;</HI> I confess it a
wholesome and strengthen∣ing Food, both for Native and Planter; which also thrives to a
prodigious increase, and bears without in∣terruption all the year about.</P>
<P>So of the <HI>Jamaica</HI> (or the five weeks Pea) by slender Art or Industry you can never
want them; and he that wants them not, has always something that's good and wholesome to seed
on. But as Idleness is the Darling
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>of Ease, so through a vain Remisness some slide into Poverty.</P>
<P>There is also the <HI>Kidney-Pea,</HI> and the <HI>Black-ey'd-Pea,</HI> much of one nature and
vertual property; and be∣cause of its figure, formation, and likeness to the
<HI>Kid∣ney-Bean,</HI> have almost to superstition made some fancy it a Specifick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pidgeon-Pea</HI> grows here also, and is a pleasant Food; but they must be
gathered whilst as yet they are young, and eaten with sweet Butter whilst their Buds are
tender.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>French-Bean</HI> (of a very large size) which, if eaten with sweet
Butter and Bacon, makes a Harmony in the Stomach. Besides several other vari∣ous and curious
sorts of Pulse this Island produceth, to the admiration of all men: So that if Summer Grain
be so happy to fall into that fertile Soil, it never misseth of a generous increase.
Moreover, here are all manner of Pulse, as if naturally strewed up and down the Coun∣trey; and
which also springs up all the year about: So that People need not to be tempted into the
considera∣tion of Starving, except through Obstinacy, or a vain Neglect, or degenerating from
Mankind, they offer an Unnatural Violence to Themselves.</P>
<P>I remember the wonderful preservation of <HI>Otto Eden,</HI> (a Dutchman) that sled in a
small Vessel from <HI>Surinam,</HI> to preserve himself and Family; which by Gods
Pro∣vidence were miraculously preserved in this Fortunate Island of <HI>Tobago;</HI> but a
Stranger on the place, and be∣cause having no Bread to eat, and his half-famish'd Children
lamenting about him, it struck him into a deep Melancholy: So that whiles under a heavy
pressure of mind, and considering what to do, a Protestant-<HI>Indian</HI> that fled along
with him, asked Mr. <HI>Eden, Why out of
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>measure so sorrowful?</HI> Mr. <HI>Eden</HI> replies, <HI>I that have fed
so many scores of People, have not at present where withal to eat:</HI> To which the
<HI>Indian</HI> answered, <HI>That God that gave you Preservation, has brought you into a Land
of Plenty; Despair not, Mr.</HI> Eden; <HI>Furnish me with a Ne∣gro or two, and a couple of
Axes, and I'll suddenly bring you some Provision to eat:</HI> Which was presently
perfor∣med by striking down a large <HI>Macaw</HI> Tree (about the bigness of a mans middle)
and of the whitish pithy substance near to the Top, he beats in a Mortar, then pressed
out the Juyce, and boiled it to the consistency of a Hasty-Pudding: But the residue he
dried, and rub'd to a perfect Flower; which with nothing else but fair Water only, he moulds into
Cakes; of which like Bread I eat at my arrival in <HI>Tobago,</HI> at the same <HI>Eden</HI>'s
House, and did verily perswade my self (before I heard this Relation) that it was Dutch
Wheaten Bisket.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="fruit" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of FRƲIT.</HEAD>
<P>I Am now entred upon the Classis of <HI>Fruits,</HI> and shal first begin with the
<HI>Cushen Apple,</HI> which is meat and drink; only made distinguishable by the Art of
boyling, whose Nuts if preserv'd you may eat, and of the Rind whiles green make an excellent
Lamp Oyl, which by small Artifice is easily obtainable.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Bmano</HI> is a fruit of that singular Admiration that the Superstitious
<HI>Papist</HI> durst not cut it with a Knise; lest desponding with himself he divide the
Cross. This Fruit also may be eaten raw, or bettered by an easy Decoction of Fire.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<P>Here is also the <HI>Figg-Tree,</HI> such as is that in <HI>Spain,</HI> and
<HI>Portugal,</HI> and several parts in <HI>America;</HI> which Fruit may be eaten while as yet
its ripe; or exposed to better Husbandry, it serves for good Drink.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Prickle-Apple,</HI> of a sharp brisk taste; (and an <HI>Indian</HI>
expedient against the <HI>Bloody-Flux</HI>) it makes a brave <HI>Marmalade:</HI> and helps for
staining and colouring any thing. But the <HI>Prickle-Pear,</HI> to speak its due praise, is
one of the most Soveraign Fruits in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pome-granate,</HI> is a Fruit of that singular Eminen∣cy, as hardly to be exprest,
without a Scriptural Phrase: They are plentiful here, a Restringent and Cooler; Consulted by
the Natives in Fevers, and Fluxes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pine-Apple,</HI> I must confess is a Fruit of that Ex∣cellency, that I want
Rhetorick and Oratory to express it. Some bears a Crown, and is the King of Fruits; but to them
with three Crowns, the Idolatrous pay their Superstitions, The Fruit of it self is of Fruit
most delicious, and the Liquor botled up, makes an admira∣ble Drink.</P>
<P>Here are also <HI>Pum-Citrons,</HI> that make an excellent l'reserve.</P>
<P>But of <HI>Oranges</HI> here are three sorts; The sower for sauce, and the Flowers for
Essences, the sweet ones are eaten for Reereation. But the <HI>China-Orange</HI> that grows
here in <HI>America,</HI> super-excels those in <HI>Europe</HI> be∣yond express.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Lemons</HI> also, here are two several sorts; the sower one, for
<HI>Lemanadoes;</HI> and the sweet one for Delectation. So of Limes also, here are sweet and
sower: with the last of which, they make Limeads and Punch.</P>
<P><HI>Guavers</HI> are a Fruit that's very stony, there's the white and the Red; but they differ
in Virtue: and if baked
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>or boyled green, are either of them Specificks against immoderate Purgations.
Moreover if you weed, or pick out the stones; you have then a basis for Marmalade, to equalize
Quinces.</P>
<P><HI>Tamerinds,</HI> grow here by natural instinct; they'r a delicate fruit, and vertual in
Feavers.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Planton</HI> of all fruits, the <HI>Nigros</HI> love best; and is a nourishing
Soveraign wholesome food. Some eat them raw when Nature has ripned them; and some a∣gain
roast them before they be ripe. Some eat them green, and some take and boyl them, and
othersome eat them as often as they get them. Now to roast them they are bread, and to boyl
them they are sawce; or Marmelade may be made: but to barbacue or dry them in the Sun you may rub
them to a Flower.</P>
<P>Here are Grapes great store, but are eaten off the Clustre; for the Planter has another
Prospect more pro∣fitable than Wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Custard Apple,</HI> to my taste I must confess is very delightful.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Sower Sop,</HI> a mediocrity of nourish∣ment: to some its meat, when to
othersome drink.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Papaw-Apple,</HI> which to my liking is very grateful, and apetizing when shaped
into sawce, by boyling it with Salt-beef: and if so happy to mingle it with sweet and fresh
Butter: except the <HI>Squash,</HI> there's nothing beyond it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mamme Apple</HI> grows to the Magnitude of a Pound Pear, its of a yellow colour, and
eats like Marmalade. Then there's the Mamme Supporter, much of the same Nature with the former,
save only the last has two stones, and the first as in order is indewed but with one.</P>
<P>The <HI>Yellow-plum,</HI> grows every where here, and is of
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>Plums a most Luscious Food. But then there's more cry then wool, for what
with the greatness of the Stone and the thickness of the external rind, the fruit can
scarcely get a Habitation betwixt them.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Cherry-trees</HI> also, (which bear the year a∣bout) whose fruit is somewhat
of a sharpish taste; then there's the Cherry which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> calls
<HI>Purgas,</HI> which, when throughly ripe, are mellifluous and sweet, of a cooling and opening
Nature, which if preserv'd would be a Rariety for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Cocur-Nut-tree,</HI> and the fruit that hangs up∣on it, the <HI>Indians</HI> idolize
it, and call it Gods-tree: be∣cause to produce both meat, drink, and Cloth: its true beyond
dispute, that the Nut of it self is a sweet be∣yond the sweetest <HI>Almond;</HI> and the
Liquor that lodgeth in the bosom of this fruit, is to my liking beyond <HI>Flo∣rens</HI> at
<HI>Frontiniack:</HI> but the Shell serves for Cups, Spoons, and Dishes; and the Rind
encompassing the Shell, serves the <HI>Indians</HI> for covering, and with the Leaves they
thatch their Houses, and make Baskets, but some more ingenious make Ropes, and Lines for
<HI>Fishing.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>Maccaw-Nut</HI> Shell, the <HI>Indians</HI> make the boles of their <HI>Tobacco</HI>
pipes; the kernel is eatable, Yet not very admirable; but the Nut of it self makes an excel∣lent
Lamp-Oyl.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Physick-Nut,</HI> of whose tree they make sences: the Nut of it
self is a violent Emetick, as also a <HI>Cathartick:</HI> but the whole macerated, and boyled
with Water, by a culinary Operation affords you Lamp Oyl.</P>
<P>Here are also two sorts of <HI>Melons;</HI> the one is called <HI>Musk,</HI> but the other
the <HI>Water-Mellon.</HI> The first is a food of incomparable taste; but the last affords
you
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>both Drink and Meat; of which you can never eat to a Surfeit.</P>
<P><HI>Penguins</HI> are a brisk and sharp fruit, extoll'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> for their
excellency in Feavers.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Cucumbers</HI> of two sorts; the one to eat raw, and the other to pickle.</P>
<P>And prodigious <HI>Pumkins,</HI> I blush to express their mag∣nitude: with <HI>Simnels</HI>
and <HI>Squashes</HI> much of a Nature concordant: these make excellent sauce to eat with
Salt Beef; and if rightly ordered, far Excel Cole∣worts.</P>
<P>Then there's two sorts of <HI>Gourds;</HI> the sweet one which the Planter boyls to make
broth Medicinal; and the wild Gourd for Instruments, and vessels to con∣tain Liquors.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="roots" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Roots.</HEAD>
<P>THis Island of <HI>Tobago</HI> Accommodates the Planter with three sorts of
<HI>Potatoes;</HI> the white, the Yel∣low, and the red <HI>Potato:</HI> but the White and the
Yellow they boyl for food; and are the general Nourishment all the <HI>Indies</HI> over. Now of
the Yellow sort the more ingenious with a Tincture of the Red make a pleasant Liquor, which
when sweetned with Sugar, they bottle it up; and after twenty four hours its ready for drink∣ing:
this is a Liquor known only by the name of <HI>Mobby,</HI> and is the universal drink in the
Island of <HI>Tobago.</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Eddies</HI> also, a most incomparable Root; and <HI>Yames,</HI> the whole
World has not better to boast of, for a wholesome, toothsome, and a Nourishing Root,
besides divers other Roots that I have no name for
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>These and <HI>Potatoes</HI> are their natural bread, if not impro∣per to call
it so; however it's food, if not bread of ano∣ther fashion. Then there's <HI>Turnips,
Parsnips, Onions,</HI> and <HI>Carrots:</HI> but these last are nourisht by art, in as much
as none of them are <HI>America's</HI> natural product.</P>
<P>The Cassado Root ranges it self in another order, whose Liquor intoxicates, and is as
truculent as Death. But the Bread thereof, if by a diligent hand well ordered, is as pleasant,
and wholsome as our <HI>English</HI> Flower; and the Drink which afterwards is made of the
Bread; is a Liquor steddy (and heady enough) known by the name of <HI>Pereno.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Herbs and Spices.</HEAD>
<P>HEre for the most part you may by your industry cause all sorts of sallating to grow,
since Nature has been bountiful by the preordinate Councel of Hea∣ven to influence, and
impregnate this Island with vari∣ety; and truly I have wondred how the soil comes to be so
rich, till considering its nourished by a Nitrous Air. And this is the place wherein
<HI>Tea</HI> grows naturally (&amp; plentifully) meaning such <HI>Tea</HI> as is frequently
sold in our <HI>English</HI> Coffee-houses.</P>
<P>There is also a certain Bark that's called by the name of <HI>Tobago</HI>-Cinnamon, that grows
upon a Shrub or a small Tree. Then there is long Pepper, that sprouts up in every Angle; and
<HI>Codd Pepper, Bell Pepper,</HI> and <HI>Round Pepper;</HI> some red, and some green, that
grows naturally withour cultivation. Then there's that fa∣mous <HI>American Spice,</HI> (or
<HI>Jamaico Pepper</HI>) that gives both the redolency, Flavour, and tact of Cloves, and
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>Cinnamon; with a complicated mixture of several and various sweets; but
these fall from the <HI>Bay-tree.</HI> Ma∣ny other profitable Rarities, as <HI>Fruits, and
Roots,</HI> be∣sides what's set down in this short Paragraph, this I∣sland, because
adorned with <HI>Roots</HI> &amp; <HI>Herbage,</HI> liberally and freely presents them to the
industrious Planter; but not as a gratuity to compensate his labour; rather out of a bounteous
and innate generosity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="flesh" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Flesh.</HEAD>
<P>ANd now we present you with the Clasis of <HI>Flesh,</HI> give me leave therefore in the
first place to begin with the <HI>Wild-Hogg,</HI> of which sort of Cattle their num∣bers are
innumerable; when yearly the people cut off at least twenty thousand, and yet they increase
soprodigi∣ously fast, that neither Gun, nor Engin, nor any other Ar∣tifice can be found to
destroy them. It's truth beyond sus∣pition that the <HI>Barbadians</HI> kill some of them;
but the rest of the <HI>Caribes</HI> and others are daily visitants; who to save it for
transportation, or preserve it for their own accom∣modation, commonly Jerk, and dry salt it
in the Sun, or in Bulk or Pickle. But here you are to consider in the description of Flesh, I
onely touch upon the natural produce of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pickery</HI> is a Beast much resembling a Hogg, save onely he draws his Breath at
his ventricle; which for the most part concentrates on the middle of his Back; which Creature by
observation is swifter of foot than the Hog is; But then his Flesh is leaner, and relishes
more of Venison then of Pork; and is taken with more diffi∣culty then usually Hogs are;
because swifter of Foot,
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>and many times endangers the Doggs that attempt him. So that he's seldom
destroyed without Gun, or Dart, by reason of the excessive largness of his tusks that
branch themselves upwards, as also downwards: yet as formidable as he presents himself to
the apprehension of some men, hitherto none has known him to set up∣on a man.</P>
<P>Then here's great quantities of the <HI>Armidillas</HI> (which the <HI>Hollander</HI> calls
<HI>Tattoos</HI>) that are Arm'd with Armour on their Backs; and the largest amongst them but
of an indifferent size, seldom exceeding one foot in height. They are a Creature that generally
feeds upon Fruits, and Roots: and when roasted have the natural taste of a Pigg, but then the
Flesh is much more Physical; as if Nature had made it a Specifick for a Surfeit.</P>
<P>Moreover, for accomodating <HI>Horses, Cows, Ass-Ne∣goes, Sheep, Deer, Hoggs, Goats,
Rawbits, &amp;c.</HI> I should lame my Description, and unworthily conceal the plenty of a
Countrey that represents to every one the bounty of Nature by Heavens generosity.</P>
<P>In this Island you will meet with two sorts of <HI>Guanos;</HI> the one of a green, but the
other of a grey colour, which is shaped like a <HI>Lizard,</HI> somewhat resembling the
<HI>Alle∣gator.</HI> I have seen some of those Creatures four and five foot in length: they
live upon Herbs, Insects and Fruits; and burrow like a Coney in the hollow Pits in sand. The
<HI>Indians</HI> extol them for Food, but the green <HI>Guano</HI> is a more delicate, and
nutricious meat; who lives only by eating of Fruits and Flies; nor is he all out so bigg as the
gray one (resembling the Creature we call the Ca∣melion) he lodgeth upon Trees, not in Cavities
of Rocks, nor will he soil himself in marley Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Coney is a delicate Creature, much big∣ener, much taller, and larger than
ours are. Their meat
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>is pleasant, wholsome, and delicious. And their Skins aromatically smell
of Musk; which occasioned some strangers to call them Musk Squirrils (or sweet Rats, though
somewhat improper) however their Skins are a good sort of Furr, and the rather because of
their natu∣ral Perfume.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Apossum,</HI> another sort of a Crea∣ture, who is in resemblance
much of the cast and figure of our <HI>English Badger</HI> (but his Leggs are equal) and the
most of any thing assimulates the <HI>Racone,</HI> and naturally because so affected with
mankind in general, that he follows him, comes to him, and delights to gaze on him. So that by
industry and an easy arti∣fice, there's but little difficulty to make him tame: However the
Femal has a false, or loose belly, where she suckles her young ones, and secures them
from at∣tempts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="armoured creatures" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Armed Creatures.</HEAD>
<P>SUch is the Land <HI>Tortois;</HI> which vulgarly goes by the name of <HI>Turtle.</HI> But they
are of two sorts, and inhabit different Soils. For the lesser (to his liking) padds the dry
ground, whiles the larger contents him∣self in low and moist bottoms: some sort of people
eat them, and commend their food for good Diet; some of them are bigger, and some less: but
the weightiest to my Observation exceeded not thirty pound.</P>
<P>Here in the Island are three sorts of Land-Crabbs <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Red, the black, and
the white Crab; but the Red of himself is naturally so, because Nature adorns him with more
Beauty externally, then internally she
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>inriches him with Aliment and Nutrition. Yet some have fancyed them very good
food, and highly applaud them; but this sort of Crab loves a rockey, and dry Land; who seldom
or rarely consults the Water.</P>
<P>The next in order we call the black Crab, from which the blew Crab differs but a little; they
are both good food, yet their excess breeds Fluxes; the one storms the Hills because high
minded, but the other more Sub∣missive contents himself in Dales.</P>
<P>Then there's the White Crab (larger then the rest) that generally lives in swamps, and miery
places: I know not what they feed on, but are of themselves most delicious food. Of this sort
the Carbs because so nume∣rous the Lazy <HI>Indian</HI> wont leave his <HI>Hamacca</HI> to
catch them; except in rainy Weather, when they creep into their houses; it may be then they'l
take so much pains as to stretch forth an arm to fling them into the fire; so roast and eat
them. These Crabs we call Delvers, because of their Undermining.</P>
<P>Of the same Classis is the <HI>Land Shell Souldier</HI> whose Claws resemble the Claws
of a Crab, but is of himself a very little Creature; some say they are eatable, but I Warrant
not that: however their fat is a soveraign Oyl, and of that singular Vertue and excel∣lency, as
to blunt the Venom of a Poysoned Dart.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="fish" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Fishes.</HEAD>
<P>ANd now I am got into the Classis of Fish, I shall offer you a present of the
<HI>Groper</HI> first, because he's a Fish generally much bigger than the
<PB N="17" REF="11"/><HI>Salmon;</HI> whose Head super-excels the head of a <HI>Cod</HI> for
goodness; but an Angler may distinguish Salt-water-fish from <HI>Salmon.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the <HI>Grooper,</HI> we bring you the grey <HI>Porgo;</HI> who though in Stature and
figure seems a lesser fish, yet is he nothing inferiour for delicate food. Then there's the
Red <HI>Porgo,</HI> of a faint pinck-colour, and scaled like the Grey, as is the Grey like the
<HI>Grooper;</HI> this fish of fish is the Fishermans charm, and every mans purchase,
whose hook and line may easily reach him.</P>
<P>But there are two sorts of <HI>Cavallas,</HI> the Green and the Grey; the last we call
<HI>House-eye,</HI> of the size of a <HI>Sal∣mon,</HI> and scaled much alike. But the Green
<HI>Cavalla</HI> is less than a <HI>Grooper,</HI> and is infinitely prefer'd before the Grey for
delicacy of taste; more excellent food, and much more Nutritious.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Mullet</HI> here are plenty; some bigger, and some less: from the size of a
<HI>Mackerel,</HI> to the extent of a <HI>Pickerel.</HI> This fish I prefer for its delicacy of
food, and by an ingenious artist makes excellent Scaveche.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Sea-chub</HI> in <HI>Tobago</HI> is a fish of that excellency, that any ways
drest is a food extraordinary; but then he must be fresh and bleeding new; otherwise he
nei∣ther affords good food, nor will he make but indifferent Physick, this fish of all fish
makes the royal <HI>Scaveche,</HI> as the Row of the <HI>Mullet</HI> makes the best
<HI>Buttargo.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Manatee</HI> or <HI>Sea-cow,</HI> is of an Amphibious Nature, that eats grass like an
Ox, and swims like an <HI>Otter:</HI> that lives sometimes under Water, and grows to a
prodigious greatness; for some of them have weighed ten and twelve hundred pound weight; they
are struck with Harping Irons, or other Engines, and so taken, whose flesh of fish
necessity only extols it; but the skin if well managed, makes a kind of Bendleather; and
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>the ill Management thereof is when they Manatee the poor <HI>Nigros,</HI> with
straps made thereof.</P>
<P>Of the fish called <HI>Turtle,</HI> there are various sorts; the <HI>Hawks-bill,</HI> the
<HI>Vandoras,</HI> the <HI>Logerhead,</HI> and the green <HI>Turtle;</HI> which the Native
<HI>Indian</HI> out of a strange admi∣ration, have to a degree of Superstition thought among
themselves, that the last was sacred; for they call it Gods fish, by reason of the
extraordinary vertue that's found therein; as if compendiously sum'd up to serve all
<HI>America.</HI> And truly I can assert it a Medicinal food, for it cured me of Poyson; from
that intoxicated Palm-Wine that the <HI>Nigros</HI> gave me, when last in <HI>Guiney;</HI> which
Poyson was expelled at the <HI>Caiamanos,</HI> about ten months after, by eating of
<HI>Turtle;</HI> but for the <HI>Gho∣norea,</HI> the <HI>Yaws</HI> and the <HI>French-pox,</HI>
there is not in Na∣ture a food more effectual. This rariety of a Creature has three large hearts
that hang together in one string; and as the <HI>Manattee</HI> is, so is she, an Amphibion
that lives in the Water, and without it; that swims like a fish, yet in the Sand lays Eggs like
a Fowl; whose fish is flesh, and admits of various tastes; as of Veal, of Beef, but the fat
is green, and eats like Marrow; and their Eggs undistinguishable from those of a Hen; which
if pickled, strung up, and barbacued in the Sun, are little or nothing inferiour to
<HI>Buttargo.</HI> And though notwithstanding the <HI>Vandoras Turtle</HI> assimilates some
what the Nature of the Green, yet is her fat not by half so sweet; and is of a more yellowish
Complexion. But the <HI>Hawks-bill</HI> is smaller, and not so Soveraign; but then it excels
the former in Substance, for our <HI>Tortois</HI> Combs are shaped from that shall: who
also lays her Eggs in the Sand as the rest do. But the <HI>Logerhead,</HI> because larger in
the front then his Fellows, shews more bulkey, and is a bigger fish. Now we
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>propound you three ways to take them; either by fools, which are shaped into
Netts: or by a strong prong of Iron, fastned to a Pole; or otherwise by turning of their
<HI>Calopeia</HI> upwards. These are the usual ways we take them, and their plenty is such in
this Island of <HI>To∣bago,</HI> that one nights work may supply a thousand peo∣ple with food
for more than twice twenty four hours.</P>
<P>The next that presents in order, is the <HI>Barracooto,</HI> and they are of two forts, and
some about two foot in length, they have a long beak, or snout, filled full of Teeth: which
when you would surprise them by a hook, and line, be sure you arm well with wier, for at
least two foot in length. The white mouth'd <HI>Barracooto</HI> is the wholsomest Fish; for
the black mouth'd Fish his Teeth are venemous, and the fleshy substance, especially near
the Back bone.</P>
<P>Then there's the great <HI>Garr,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> calls <HI>Needle Fish,</HI>
about some two foot long; whose bill is shaped like a <HI>Snite,</HI> good and wholsom
Diet. But the smaller <HI>Garr-fish,</HI> which also has a long beak, and sel∣dom exceeds
twelve inches in length; if by an Artist drest and fried with fresh Butter, its difficult to
distinguish his taste from a <HI>Smelt.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pilchard</HI> we have also here (but then its smaller then ours in <HI>England</HI>)
which rush into the Bays for self-preservation, when chased or pursued by a Master
Fish: So that sometimes part of their Shoals are forced a Shoar, and taken up by casting Nets
(and others) in very great quantities. But the <HI>Pilchards</HI> in <HI>Barbados</HI> are
feavourish some months in the year.</P>
<P>Here also we have a Fish which we call an <HI>Anchovy,</HI> much smaller than a
<HI>Pilchard,</HI> and of an <HI>Anchovy</HI> shape; which if taken in season, and pickled by
Art, may for
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>ought I know, vye with those from Forreign Part</P>
<P>The <HI>Hedg-hogg</HI> Fish we have here also, that are arm'd with prodigious strong
Prickles: which in bigness and largness exceed the Land <HI>Ʋrchin.</HI> Some have eaten
them, and say they are very good food; But I rather ap∣prove of their Oyl for Aches.</P>
<P>So of the <HI>Coney Fish,</HI> which is of a smaller size, that has purchased his name
from the shape of his mouth. He's a Fish as seldom fed on as any Fish, but his Flesh
drawn out and neatly stuft, they send them to <HI>England,</HI> and other Parts for
Rarities.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Indian Sturgeon</HI> (so called by the <HI>English</HI>) frequents the Bays, and
are some of them five or six foot in length. The Fish wants only the art of well cu∣ring, to
preserve it for transportation into Remoter Parts. However if you eat him fresh, you will
find him excellent Food: they are taken with the line, and sometimes with Nets; but take them at
all times they are seldom out of season. Now were there a Fishery erected in this Island,
without dispute it would turn to a very good accompt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolphin</HI> is a Fish that gives chase to the flying Fish; which are numberless
here. But the <HI>Dolphin</HI> in his chase, shines of a golden colour, when at other times (he
preys not) his Scales shew like Silver. They are taken with the Hook, as we sail round the
Island; some of them two, or three foot long, and more. They are delicate food, and make a fine
Scaveche; which to admiration when their lives expire, they reflect a tin∣cture of what presents
unto them. By which we may perceive, that the privation of water (which is their natural Element)
causes an immediate Cessation of the actions of life.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flying fish</HI> is not all out so bigg as a <HI>Herring,</HI> nor
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>by much so boney, but is delicate food: which makes se∣veral
<HI>Fishes</HI> in the Sea prey upon him: who in a fresh gale dilates his finns, which Nature
has lent him, as wings to fly with; &amp; which conveys him sometimes half a furlong, or further.
So that dipping his wings again into the salt Ocean, he readily prepares for another flight, and
mind∣ful of the <HI>Fish</HI> persuing after him, he flies into the chains or midship of a
vessel: and sometimes on the quar∣ter Decks; as it happened to me in my passage to
<HI>Bar∣bados,</HI> that a flying Fish as I sat at the Table; sprung out of the Sea, and flew
into my Lap.</P>
<P>The <HI>Boneto</HI> likewise he prays upon flying Fish, and is taken with the Hook, though
sometimes we stick them with Fisgigs, which with sharpened &amp; barbed Prongs of Iron are
fastned to a Pole, having some Lead on the ex∣treamest part. Some of this kind are thirty
inches long; which boyled and eaten with fresh Butter, and the juyce of a Lemmon, maks a Food
most delicious.</P>
<P>So the <HI>Albacore</HI> that has the figure and shape of a <HI>Bo∣neto;</HI> yet is he
bigger, longer, and larger; much of the nature and relish of the <HI>Boneto;</HI> and preys on
the fly∣ing Fish, as the <HI>Boneto</HI> does. By which you may con∣clude, that the flying Fish
of all Fish is surrounded with Enemies.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Amber Fish,</HI> an excellent Food; so is the <HI>Angel Fish,</HI>
and the <HI>green Swallow</HI>-Tail; but the last is a Fish not much bigger than a
<HI>Herring:</HI> all of them take the hook, and if they like their commons dispond not of death,
when to sacrifice their lives to the Angler.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parrot Fish</HI> whose Scales shine with green and yellow, his head resembles
the head of a <HI>Parrot,</HI> let the delicacy of the Food praise it self. So of the
<HI>Golden Fish,</HI> called <HI>Dorado</HI> (by the <HI>Spaniard</HI>) his Scales all
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>glister like Gold. This and the other is about the size of a
<HI>Mackarel,</HI> equivalent in Food with the former Fish. And of fresh Fish, every River
and Rivulet swarms with Plenty.</P>
<P>The next <HI>Armado</HI> that in order approach us, are the Shell-Fish; for that end let us
martial the <HI>Lobster</HI> or <HI>Craw-Fish,</HI> first; which are of a prodigious growth
in these parts, yet have not their fore Claws, as those in <HI>England;</HI> but they are
extreamly delicious, to the <HI>Gusto,</HI> because they have a sweet, and if with liberty I
may presume to say it, a pleasant and delightful taste. But then the <HI>Tobago</HI> Crab
as much excells our <HI>English Crab,</HI> as the <HI>Lobster</HI> is approved above
comparison. But they have <HI>green Crabs</HI> which in shape are like those in
<HI>England,</HI> save onely by nature they have a larger growth; these sort of
<HI>Crabs</HI> are delicious <HI>Food.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sea-souldier</HI> assimilates the <HI>Crab,</HI> by reason of the great and
smaller Claws: whose Shell resembles a Snail the most of any thing, and looks like Pearl of
an ob∣scure colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cunck</HI> is a Shell Fish, of which we have plenty, nor have I known a sweeter
Food; two boys in two hours may take enough for 500 men. This <HI>Fish</HI> may be boiled, stewed
with wine, or fryed with fresh Butter; eat them any ways, or any how, there's no <HI>Fish</HI> I
per∣swade my self, better of his kind; whose Shell has the tincture of Pearl colour, slame
colour, and white, some part thereof being taken out, the <HI>Indians</HI> makeof it their
<HI>Wampam Pieg;</HI> which Shell is a staple Commodity</P>
<P><HI>The Horn-fish,</HI> I have seen some of them ten inches long, and not unlike the
resemblance of a <HI>Post-boys-horn:</HI> The Shell of this <HI>Fish</HI> is of a sine
<HI>figure,</HI> and partly of a Pearl colour, but not very Orient; yet the meat very
excellent.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
<P>The <HI>Orney</HI> also is a sort of <HI>Shell-fish,</HI> that sticks and adheres to the
sides of Rocks; some of them you may pick up as big as an Egg, which if eaten with sweet
butter, are a delicious food: and the shell of this fish has an Orient Tincture.</P>
<P>So of the <HI>Scollop-fish,</HI> whose shell is as big as a saucer, and partly
resembling a Pearl in colour. This Fish has but half a Shell, and sticks on the Rocks as
birdlime to a twigg: which if neatly drest, and well ordered, you'l have little cause to
complain of your diet.</P>
<P><HI>Cockles</HI> grow here to the bigness of an Egg, but then there's an inferiour growth that
never arrive to that Maturity: both lye in Sand, but examin'd by the fire, and if you have no
aversion to fish, I'll pass my word you will find good food.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Sea-Snail,</HI> here are very great quantities: and some of them you will meet with
as big as your fist: they lye very thick, and close together, on very Sholes and Rocks, and
sometimes on banks that are almost dry: which without difficulty may be attempted, and taken at
low-water. Their Shells are of a curious Fi∣gure to form Cups of: and as much as any fish
imitates the Oriental.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rock Oyster,</HI> adheres to the cliffs of the Rocks: the inside of whose Shell is
of a shining colour; his Li∣quor brackish, and his flesh good food. But that other
<HI>Oyster</HI> that produceth the Pearl, they lye in some four or five fathom Water, which the
<HI>Indians</HI> dive for, to obtain that treasure: but we think to examin a readier expedient,
if when once we come to have Dredges a∣mongst us.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Mangrove Oyster,</HI> that grows upon Trees on the tops of boughs, &amp; the
smaller branches; for you must know the Red <HI>Mangrove</HI> grows always in Salt-water, and
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>the tops of the trees because bending their boughs down wards (peradventure
lick on the Surface of the water) which by natural instinct incline towards their roots By this
means the Oysters Cluster, and clung together about them: that not a bough is barren. Now
some folks eat them out of Curiosity, but truly I cannot commend them for good food. Their
Shells partly Pearl colour, and almost transparent, and because very thin and clear, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> substitute them in lieu of Glass.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sea-Egg</HI> is of two sorts: some black, and some grey. But either sort are
guarded, and arm'd with Prickles. But the grey eggs are the Oysters, because re∣sembling them
in taste: and are eaten raw, with Vine∣gar and Pepper; but better stewed with Wine, and
Shellots, and sometimes with a cast of <HI>East-India Spices;</HI> which so ordered, I
confess, there's no richer food. So that you may read in the Compendions Catalogue, Some Fish
are for food, and some others for Physick.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="fowl" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Fowl.</HEAD>
<P>NOw Gentlemen, as we have described the Race and Family of Fish; so if you please let us
con∣sult the Genealogy of Fowl; their vertue, and variety; because multiplied here, as if
<HI>Tobago</HI> was a Paradice for <HI>English</HI>-men to inhabit in. First therefore give me
leave to begin with the <HI>Bill-Bird,</HI> whose Bill, or Beak shews as bigg as his Body; an
evidence whereof is in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park: but the <HI>Indians</HI> eat them, and extoll
them for <HI>Food.</HI></P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Black-Bird,</HI> about the bigness of a <HI>Crow,</HI> which feeds on the
<HI>Berries</HI> that fall from the <HI>Palmeto;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>whose flesh is nothing inferiour to a Pidgeon. But the smaller Black-bird
resembles ours in <HI>England;</HI> save on∣ly it has a longer bill, and the Fleshy part of
the taste of our <HI>English</HI> Starlin so that you must strip him of his skin,
otherwise he eats bitter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Booby</HI> so called, is a bird over credulous; be∣cause when to proffer him your
hand, he'l perch on your fist. He feeds upon fish, and his flesh eats fishey; and some of
them you shall see as big as a Capon, whose Down is rich, beyond degrees of Comparison; and
less than two ounces from each individual Bird, you need never doubt of, and their Numbers so
numerous that in ten days time, and by easy Artifice, an ordinary man may procure ten
thousand.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blew headed Parrot,</HI> is a very pretty bird, but in largeness he's somewhat
inferiour to the Green: they may be taught to talk any dialect: because naturally affect∣ed with
the Vanity of tattle. Roast, or boyl them, you'l commend the Diet. So of the
<HI>Parraketoes,</HI> of which there are two sorts; one about the bigness of our <HI>En∣glish
Thrush,</HI> but plumed like a Parrot, and because inclinable to prattle, the difficulty's the
less to learn them to speak. But the smaller <HI>Paraketo</HI> exceeds not a Spar∣row in
bigness; and like the green Parrot may be taught to talk, whose flesh is equivalent with that
of the Par∣rot, save only you have not so much at a meal. Then there's the <HI>Main
Parrot,</HI> whose head is Yellow, and has a yellow brest: which to make him more beautiful
Nature has cloathed him though in green. This bird speaks the best, and is more Docible then
the rest; and if I mistake not, is a rich food to feed on.</P>
<P>Then there's the <HI>Macaw,</HI> that's headed like a Parrot, but his body in proportion is four
times bigger, whose Feathers because shaded with blews, reds, and green,
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>makes him shine with lustre, since beautified with such e∣minent
colours One of them is to be <HI>seen</HI> in St <HI>James</HI>'s Park.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Flamingo</HI> of all fowls is the fairest; and as they generally fly in Covees
together, so they frequent∣ly feed in flocks together: whose stature is tall and upright;
equal to the height of a man. Some call them good food, but I assert they have curious
Feathers, and of various colours. Truly to admiration when I have viewed this Creature, I have been
led into speculation to Contemplate the Creation: whose outside, because most beautiful,
interprets a more glorious inside. But to the <HI>Flamingo</HI> whose wings are skin'd with a
glori∣ous Pin-colour, inclinable to Scarlet: and because, fring∣ed and tipt with sables: make
them show rich, as to the Majesty of birds.</P>
<P><HI>Tobago</HI> also has a <HI>Duck</HI> which is delicate food: but then they are smaller
than ours in <HI>England;</HI> and dege∣nerate as to setting, for ours will set all night on
the Sand, but these sort aloft, and lodge in Trees.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sea-gull</HI> is much of a Cast with those in <HI>England,</HI> somewhat larger
then a Duck, and of a dunnish co∣lour.</P>
<P>And so the <HI>Sea-mew</HI> is plentiful here, and much of the Nature with those in
<HI>England:</HI> if different in any thing, their food eats better.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plover</HI> we have here, are of two distinct sorts, and are generally grey, but the
one is distinguishable from the other, by reason of different proportion, they are both good
food, and delicious to feed on,</P>
<P>The <HI>Turtle-dove</HI> also admits of a double distinction, because here are two
sorts, one bigger then another, but the larger they only coo, and the lesser sort have a
kind of mournful murmuring Note; both of them are eatable, and delicate food.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>
<P>The <HI>Man of War Bird</HI> (so called) makes to the ship∣ping some distance from the
Coast, ere ever the Sea∣men can discover Land: he preys upon Fish, and has a fishy taste.
His Body seemingly is as bigg as a Tur∣key; whose Feather is of a blackish grey, but his
Gills look red, like a <HI>Turkey Cock</HI> when he Bristels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bird of Paradice</HI> (or the <HI>King-fisher</HI>) is much a∣bout the bigness of
our <HI>English Starlin,</HI> whose Feathers represent all colours imaginable: he lives upon
Flies that swim on the surface of the water, and that's his Food which Nature affords him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pelican</HI> is a Bird about the bigness of a Goose, that has a great head, and a
very large swallow, and a Crop or Craw larger than other Birds. Some of our people has made Caps
of their Craws, which they wore to cover their heads. This Bird feeds upon <HI>Fish,</HI> and has
himself a fishy taste; but his Down is excellent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cockerrico</HI> is the <HI>Indian</HI> name for the <HI>Tobago Phe∣sants,</HI> which
are as large, and as fair as our <HI>English Phe∣sants;</HI> and those that have fed upon
them, say, they are better food. They are easily taken in Glades with Nets, or struck with
shot from the Bows of Trees.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of <HI>Curlews,</HI> the one of them is red, and as bigg as a Capon; that
has a crooked long beak, and gets his living by sucking in salt-water-plashes. But the grey
<HI>Curlew,</HI> which is shaped like the red one, differs onely in colour, and in feeding in the
freshes. They are both choice food, for those that feed on them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wood-Pidgeon</HI> so called here, feeds most upon Ber∣ries; and is to my thinking
the choicest food in <HI>Ameri∣ca.</HI> This Bird is bigger than an <HI>English Pidgeon,</HI>
and are sometimes so fat that they burst with their fall, when we have taken them off from
tops of Trees with our
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>Shot. Here are many other Birds, and Fowls fit for food, but I want names for
them; moreover their Fea∣thers are serviceable and profitable to the Planters, either for
present use, or transportation.</P>
<P>Moreover this Island of <HI>Tobago</HI> for raising of stock, may make such improvement
by <HI>Geese, Ducks, Turkies, Pullin,</HI> &amp;c. (I speak within the bounds of modesty)
<HI>Ame∣rica</HI> cannot produce a richer Soil.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="wood" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Timbers.</HEAD>
<P>I Begin with the <HI>Cedar</HI> first, because its a Tree of emi∣minency (and stature)
that naturally grows in the Island of <HI>Tobago,</HI> and affords excellent Timber from two
foot, to five foot diameter; with this sort of Wood they generally build their houses, and
shipping; except what's transported to <HI>Barbados</HI> and other Parts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Green Hart</HI> is next, which I take to be <HI>Hercules;</HI> and of this sort of
Wood they make all manner of In∣struments, either for inlaying, or the use of Turnery.</P>
<P>Then there is the <HI>Locust</HI> of two several sorts, the one white, and the other is red,
from two to three foot dia∣meter; either of them are very good Timber for building Houses, Shores
for Milnes, Spindles, and Shafts: they are good to make Beams, and Knees for shipping, or
in∣deed, to speak generally, any thing else.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mastick</HI> is a Timber Tree of so fine a grain, that it plains like our
<HI>English Box;</HI> some of them are three and four foot Diameter, it's sit for all uses,
and of a na∣ture so durable, that the <HI>Caribe</HI>-Planters call it Wood e∣verlasting.</P>
<P><HI>Mohogeny</HI> is a Tree that resembles the <HI>Cedar</HI> in colour,
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>and is excellent Timber for building of Ships: the <HI>Indi∣an Spaniard</HI>
uses it much in their building, in regard it's a Timber the worm will seldom touch under water.
Now I fancy this Timber an excellent sheathing for Shipping.</P>
<P>The <HI>Man-grove,</HI> by some called <HI>Red-wood,</HI> the proper use of the Wood is for
Diers: which if further exami∣ned, the Bark is useful in Tanning. But white <HI>Mangrove</HI> is
of little use, save onely good to make Ropes with.</P>
<P>The <HI>White-wood</HI> is a Tree of that singular vertue, the worm will seldom touch it,
therefore have the <HI>English A∣mericans</HI> consulted with this Timber to build their
ship∣ping, in regard of the singularity and durability of the Wood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Yellow Sander</HI> Tree, is from two to five foot di∣ameter; a Timber of excellent
use, and may be fitted to any purpose; it's very useful in the place where it grows, and it's
profitable also to those that transport it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bay-tree</HI> is a Tree of that admirable vertue, most people admire it: whose Bark
is like Cinnamon, and whose Berries, as are those in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> of a Clove, and a
Cinnamon scent and taste, qualifies it with a double na∣ture of Spice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Box-tree</HI> here is a solid, and firm wood; but sel∣dom or rarely grows to that
degree of Timber.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fiddle-tree,</HI> so called, has a sweet Flower, and grows up to Timber also, and
is useful in building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Brazil Tree,</HI> Nature has given it the growth of Timber; and a tincture of that
vertue, that it's useful for Diers, in staining of stuffs, or colouring of Cloth.</P>
<P><HI>Brazilleto,</HI> is a Minor or Junior <HI>Brazil,</HI> seldom or rarely arriving to the
magnitude of Timber; but as useful in dying as the former.</P>
<P><HI>Bully-Tree</HI> is a ponderous, durable and compact Wood; that sinks if put into the
Water: they use it
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>in <HI>Barbados</HI> for Rolers, but principally for Coggs, to Spindles, and
Shafts in their Windmills: besides seve∣ral other uses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cocus Tree,</HI> we thought it unnecessary to range that among the Timber Trees,
having considered it very useful to inlay with; and as profitable as plentiful to the
industrious Turner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cassia Fistula</HI> is a Tree, but I cannot warrant it Timber; however the Fruit
is for Physical Use.</P>
<P>The <HI>Callabash Tree,</HI> is a kind of tough Timber, which we shape into Pumps,
Pump-boxes, Knees, and Timber for small Vessels; and with the shell of the fruit, some
folks make drinking Cups, which are called <HI>Calabashes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Granadilla</HI> is a <HI>bastard Cocus;</HI> much of its nature, and useful in the
like cases.</P>
<P><HI>Green Fustick</HI> is a sort of Timber fitted for Instru∣ments, or the art of inlaying;
but the <HI>Yellow Fustick</HI> is more proper for Diers, as it may be directed; or suited at
pleasure to other uses.</P>
<P><HI>Lignum vitae</HI> is a compact and ponderous Wood, good to make Bowls with, and as good to
make Bowls of; I mean your Punch Bowl, and also Pestles and Mortars; but the <HI>Gum,
Flowers,</HI> &amp; <HI>Bark,</HI> are preserved as Druggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Ale or any other
Liquor, if provided it have stood ten or twelve hours in a <HI>Lignum-vitae</HI>-Cup, and drunk,
it helps against Consumptions.</P>
<P><HI>Manchioneel,</HI> is a sort of Timber for Plank, and Shea∣thing, so naturally
seasoned with some bitter taste, that the Worm willby no means touch it.</P>
<P><HI>Yellow Plumb-tree,</HI> is a very good <HI>Timber,</HI> and fitted for several uses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cabbage Tree,</HI> grows to a prodigious heighth, some to one hundred foot in length,
yet has but a fibrous root and the <HI>Cabbage</HI> you shall observe at the extreamest part;

<PB N="31" REF="18"/>save onely a lovely Plume of green leaves over shade it. But it's no
<HI>Timber</HI> tree, by reason it contains so very much Pith: however it's useful for
Palasades, and to make Pumps, Gutters, Troughs, and Pailing with: but of the hard, and outmost
Rind, the <HI>Indians</HI> by the use of fire make Piles for their Arrows; and with the leaves
they cover the tops of their Houses, or Wiggwams; but the <HI>Cabbage</HI> it self is a most
delicious food, and su∣per-excells our in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ebony tree</HI> grows naturally here, I need not to speak the use of that.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Shrubs</HI> that grow here, are the <HI>Physick Nut</HI> and <HI>Flowerfence:</HI>
which are planted in rows (or lines) as our Hedges are to divide and distinguish Plantations,
And the <HI>Sensible Plant,</HI> which contracts it self as soon as you touch it, is but a
Shrub neither, that grows plenti∣fully here</P>

<HEAD>The Staples of <HI>Tobago.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Cocao</HI> (that maketh <HI>Chocolatto</HI>) is a Nut so generally known, that it
needs no discription: but yet I thought good to incert for encouragement, that in the Latitude of
the Island of <HI>Tobago,</HI> one Acre of Land by modest computation may yield to the Planter
400 pie∣ces of Eight <HI>per Annum,</HI> (which in <HI>Barbados</HI> is valued at 100
<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> Sterling</HI>) after the Trees have been planted six years. Then there's
another thing worthy your conside∣ration, that never any <HI>Herricane</HI> nor the Blasts
(satal to <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola</HI>) has been ever known in the Lati∣tude of
<HI>Tobago</HI> to strike the tender blossom, and buds, with its perishing stroke: which
experience confirms
<PB N="32" REF="19"/>unto us, that by opening of the Woods in those parts thereby to plant Canes,
or ground provision; they let in the Blast, that invaded the <HI>Cocao</HI> (but in this
latitude, were we open to the Ocean, it's never the worse; for it never blasts here) which
<HI>Cocao</HI> was so plentiful in <HI>Jamai∣ca,</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola</HI> formerly, that in
the year 1654. I was at the taking of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessel loaden with <HI>Cocao,</HI>
which came from <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> so great was the plenty, then, and to admiration; but the
reason I have already laid down, why there is such a searcity now, and think it needless to
make repetition, save onely to tell you that the <HI>Cocao Tree</HI> grows naturally wild in the
Woods here in <HI>Tobago,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> here gathered of the Nuts and brought to
us; which Nuts were transported to <HI>Bar∣bados,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Rodderigo</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI>
now in <HI>England</HI> can evi∣dence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sugar Cane</HI> was planted here by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and I almost blush to
express their wonderful increase, that the produce of one Acre of Canes should amount to
six thousand pound of Sugar, besides <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Mollassos:</HI> which in
<HI>Barbados</HI> and the <HI>Leward Islands</HI> they esteem it great profit if at any time
one Acre yields them three thousand. And yet the Sugar Cane we approve to be none of the best
Staples in the Island of <HI>Tobago.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Tobacco</HI> that grows in this Island is nothing inferiour to <HI>Spanish
Trinidado,</HI> that lies distant about some seven Leagues, and not above twenty miles North
from the <HI>Verines;</HI> from whence comes the best <HI>Tobacco</HI> in the world. Several
small Vessels have I seen loaden from <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and the <HI>Tobacco</HI> sold
in the <HI>Role</HI> for 2 <HI><ABBR>s.</ABBR> per</HI> pound, which Merchandize they transport
to old <HI>Spain</HI> and other Parts to advance the price, which turns to considerable profit.
So that in <HI>Tobago</HI> I perswade my self that a stout labouring man may make 3000
<ABBR>l.</ABBR> of <HI>To∣bacco</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="19"/>into Roll every year, and do it with a great deal of ease, which if sold
but at seven pence <HI>per</HI> pound ster∣ling, comes to a considerable sum; as the
<HI>Holander</HI> when they had the Island ingrossed the same, and gave six
<HI>Sti∣vers</HI> for it there: which was afterwards transported to considerable profit.</P>
<P><HI>Indigo</HI> is a certain vveed that grows in <HI>Barbados,</HI> and in most of the
<HI>Leward</HI> Islands: but the best to my obser∣vation grevv in <HI>Guatimale,</HI> vvhich
lies in or near the la∣titude of <HI>Tobago;</HI> by vvhich I may rationally conclude that as good
<HI>Indigo</HI> may be made here, as there; that one hand may dress up, and cure 1500 pound
vveight in one year, all materials fitted, and the vveed brought to the place.</P>
<P>There are tvvo sorts of <HI>Cotton;</HI> Ravil and Vine, of either sort of vvhich an
industrious Planter may Plant tvvo thousand vveight in a year: and this I look upon is the
meanest staple in <HI>Tobago</HI> for a man to go upon, and employ his hands.</P>
<P><HI>Ginger,</HI> That's another Staple; and as good grows here as in any part of the World,
which admits of two several ways of curing to better it: so that some scal'd and dry it,
othersome scrape it; but the last is best, and more then doubles the price, let Markets
rule as they will. But of the first its ordinary for one man to make seven Thousand pound
vveight a year.</P>
<P><HI>Sarsaparilla,</HI> is a Spanish drug that grows in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> of which by
reason of the great plenty in <HI>Tobago,</HI> one man I perswade my self, may gather and dry
as much as by modest Computation comes to eighty, or a hundred pound Sterling a year.</P>
<P><HI>Semper Vioum,</HI> is a certain Juicy Plant, that's guard∣ed with a priekle Leaf; I need not
tell you the use, and vertue of this Plant, of which the Planter here, as in
<PB N="34" REF="20"/><HI>Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. may make as good Aloes, as that which comes from
<HI>Succotrina.</HI> So that a Thousand weight of Aloes <HI>Succotrina,</HI> will countervale the
value of two Thousand of <HI>Hippatica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bees-wax,</HI> is another Staple; of the Honey we make Metheglen, or expose it to other
uses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vinillios</HI> grows like the Cod of a French bean, and is somewhat flat, and thinner,
and full of small seeds. It generally grows upon bushes, or Brambles that spread
themselves upon Rocks. So that when it blossoms, it sends forth such a fragancy as
perfumes the Air; and when the Codds are ripening, they first turn green, after that brown, and
last of all a more Ob∣scure Colour. Some use them as a perfume for <HI>Choca∣lata,</HI> or
other wise to put amongst Cloths. But the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> pickle them for Transportation,
and their way, and manner is by scalding them in a pickle made up with Salt and Lime-water, which
afterwards they dry up, and bind them in Bundels of about one hundred in a bundle; which bundles
have been sold in <HI>England</HI> for twenty, thirty, or fourty Shillings a Bundle: of these
sweet Cods I perswade my self that an active man may gather as much in a season, as will
amount to the value of ten thousand Codds, and not loose much time.</P>
<P>The Natural <HI>Balsam</HI> (as we call it) is a certain sappy juice, that issues forth
of the body of the tree, after you have wounded it, by making a hole therein; so tap it, and the
Liquor descends into a clean Gourd, or any o∣ther Vessel that's placed under it. The leaf of
this tree differs but a little from that of the Fig-tree, and the <HI>Bal∣sam</HI> of most
soveraign use for wounds, both in ward and outward. Yet the true Valuation of this excellent
Balsam, is hitherto unknown. However great quanti∣ties,
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>as thirty or fourty Gallons, may be gathered in a year, by a diligent and
industrous man.</P>
<P>And then there's the <HI>Balm,</HI> (like that) of <HI>Gilea,</HI> (and equal in Vertue for
ought I know) that comes from the Flower of the Balsam-tree, whose Leaf is Yellow, of a golden
colour, and as big as a Rose when the flower is full blown, in which yellow Rose, there appears
about some three or four bubbles, or drops of an Amber colour, each of the bigness of a Pea,
which springs out of the Rose, and is that excellent and miraculous Balm, more valuable then
Money. But the vertues I acquired of an <HI>Indian,</HI> who instructed me in the use on't,
which at that juncture of time proved fortunate to me, when to consider the cut, and bruise of
my finger that made me languish under intollerable pain, yet in one Minutes time to be released
from pain: and within less than twenty four hours to receive an absolute cure, confirm∣ed it a
Medicament of admirable vertues. Of which pre∣cious Balm, I modestly judge near forty pound
weight might be gathered (by an industrous man) in less space of time then eight or ten
months, besides other Labor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Silk-Grass,</HI> so called, is a Plant that flourishes most in moist bottoms,
and has a large broad long and thick Leaf, guarded with Prickles, not much unlike the teeth of a
Saw, yet spread themselves every way; out of the Centre of these Leaves there grows a
stalk, twelve or fourteen foot high, to four or five inches Diameter, to∣wards the Bottom. When
this stalk begins to Wi∣ther, then the leaves are cut away, and laid in Water as you do Hemp;
afterwards they dry it in the Sun, then hackle off the rotten pitthy substance which adheres to
the more purer part of the silk-grass, which may be spun to the fineness of silk,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereof you may make furniture for houses, or habits for your self and others.

<PB N="36" REF="21"/>But the general use of it is to make Ropes, and fishing Lines, of which to
my certain knowledge there's no stronger, nor better in the World, and is a good Staple.</P>
<P><HI>Arnotto</HI> or <HI>Annotto,</HI> its all one, (the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call it
<HI>Rocoo</HI>) it strikes a deep red, and is profitable for Dyers. The plenty of this Plant is
such here that one man on an Acre of ground may in one years time make a thousand pound Weight:
but the <HI>Annotto</HI> is cured two several ways: First the <HI>Barrel,</HI> which is an
inferiour sort, and barrel'd up whiles as yet its moist: but the Cakes are dryed in the
<HI>Sun.</HI> I have set down the method, and or∣der for both. This <HI>Annotto</HI> groweth in
prickly Burrs, like Teasels, which Burrs when they be ripe, are full of Red seeds that are to
be gathered in dry Weather, and put on a clean floor to thrash out the seed, which af∣terwards
ought to be put into a Fatt, and steeped there till the water elicites a deep red Tincture: which
the rather and sooner is done, if provided you sometimes stir it. Then with a sieve, (or
somewhat else of a like nature) they separate the seeds from the tincture by let∣ting the
water run through a Fosset till nothing visibly remains, but a Recrement or Sedement in the
bottom, which substance when like batter, they put it into Bar∣rels, and so transport it.
But others more curious, dry it in the <HI>Sun,</HI> which makes it better, and fitter for sale;
and to yield almost a double price.</P>
<P>The <HI>Green Tarr</HI> issues out of the earth from the <HI>Mun∣jack Rocks,</HI> and is
commonly gathered after a shower of Rain, by skimming it off from the surface of the Water; and
then put it into a great Gourd, or such like Vessel, that has a hole at the bottom, they
separate the Oyl from the Water, by suffering the Water to slide gently out, but vvhen the
Oyl appears, they cautiously stop and pre∣serve it for several servile uses, as to burn
in Lamps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="21"/>and has a most foveraign vertue to help against pains, and Aches in any
part of the Body. In the Island of <HI>Tobago</HI> great quantities of this Oyl is
procurable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Munjack</HI> is nothing else than a Confirmation or Coagulation of the <HI>Tarr</HI>
(we spoke of) into a more so∣lid body, which <HI>Munjack</HI> were it in a frigid, as it is in
the torrid <HI>Zone,</HI> would be absolute Cole, such as we burn in <HI>England.</HI> This
<HI>Munjack</HI> after its beat into pow∣der, they incorporate or mingle it with Earth, to burn
under their Coppers in <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> otherwise it runs in∣to an oily Substance, by
reason of the heat; as has been observed by melted Pitch, instead whereof the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> substitutes <HI>Munjack.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Soap Earth,</HI> represents to me a kind of Clay, that Nature has indued with vertue,
and the Qualifica∣tion of cleansing, and purifying other bodies: which dissolves in Salt, or
in fresh Water; and makes a lather like sope-sudds, wherewith I washed my hands; and it not
only scoured them, but took off the tanning to Ad∣miration, and so it happens either to Linnen
or Wool∣en; by reason of its Mundificative Vertue and Quali∣ty.</P>
<P>There is also a <HI>Clay</HI> that serves to clay Sugar with, or you may if you please
make Earthen ware thereof. Moreover it will make good Brick or Tile, or to mingle it with Sand, you
may shape it into Glass.</P>
<P>Many curious Shells, stones, Markasites, and Mine∣rals are found up and down the Island of
<HI>Tobago,</HI> whose vertue and worth is as yet unknown, and as by the Bounty of Heaven here's
plenty enough for the Susten∣tation of Man, and Beast: so by a natural instinct, and
inclination Nature opens her doors of Treasure, where∣with to adorn, and inrich the industrous:
God is pleas∣ed to endue this Island with plenty, so let her Inhabi∣tants
<PB N="38" REF="22"/>be mindful not to Surfeit with excess: for if ful∣ness, and ease, be the
parents of idleness; idleness must of Necessity be the darling of a soft and remiss
Genera∣tion, that slides into the foolish Embracements of Ho∣nour and Ambition, which is the
overthrow of civil So∣ciety; and from which two evils, <HI>Libera nos Domi∣ne.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Directions for Improvement in the Island of <HI>TOBAGO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUppose a Man that has an hundred pound Sterlin is minded to transport himself; and
Family, consist∣ing of eleven in number, to this Island of <HI>Tobago,</HI> and suppose
their passages may cost him fifty pound; and Manuals with other things requisite and
necessary for Planting, as also Provision for the first twelve months, together with the
charge of Houshold stuffs, and all o∣ther Necessaries, may stand him in 47
<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> more: Suppose also this man takes a Lease of fifty Acres
of Land for a thousand years, at the rate of twelve-pence an Acre anually, it amounts but to two
pound ten shil∣lings a year, (except otherwise he purchase the Fee simple of the
Proprietors) which compleats the hun∣dred pound; This is the first Money laid out; nor need he be
at any more charge, for in twelve months time he will have ground provision enough, and in all
Pro∣bability two Crops of Tobacco.</P>
<P>The next thing to consider of, is the Improvement of the said Land; which is as followeth.
After your Arrival in the Island of <HI>Tobago</HI> the first six Months may
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>be spent to clear fifteen Acres of Land, and to put Provisions into the
ground; to build Conveniencies to accomodate your self, and Family, to adapt and fit the ground
for planting a Nursery of <HI>Cacoa-nuts;</HI> as also a bed sowed with <HI>Tobacco</HI>
seeds, and be sure to keep your Nursery clear from Weeds. Then about a Months time after you
have sown your Tobacco seed (provided the Seasons be good) you may then draw your Tobacco
Plants, and plant them about some four foot distance, one from another, regularly and in rows:
which said Tobacco <HI>Tobago</HI> produces, is nothing inferiour to <HI>Spa∣nish
Trinidado,</HI> that lies about seaven Leagues distance from the said Island of
<HI>Tobago,</HI> where I have seen the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (when I was a Prisoner amongst
them) sell great quantities of <HI>Trinidado Tobacco</HI> at the rate of two Shillings a pound;
which said <HI>Tobacco</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> transport from thence, to old
<HI>Spain;</HI> and sell it there to considerable advantage. Now amongst your
<HI>Tobac∣co</HI> plants, you may plant your <HI>Cocoa,</HI> and transplant them when about six
Months old, into new ground, fitted at ten or twelve foot distance; and be sure to keep clean
from Weeds; In which latter six Months time, you may have on your cleared ground two Crops of
<HI>Tobacco.</HI> Now admiting you make but eight thousand weight of Neat <HI>Tobacco</HI> on the
said Ground; yet in all probability (provided your People be healthy) it may double the number to
sixteen thou∣sand. But if it do not, and put the case your <HI>Tobacco</HI> fell but for an
eighth part of what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sell for in <HI>Trinidado</HI> (which is but three
pence <HI>per</HI> pound fold here in our Island) yet will this Crop yield you one hundred pounds
Sterlin, which is your Money gained the very first year, and in six month time, all charges
being born.</P>
<P>Now suppose that at the beginning of the second year
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>the said fifteen Acres be all cleared; and Provision e∣nough put into
<HI>the ground</HI> sufficient for double your num∣ber of hands: you may rationally then expect
four Crops in twelve Months time, when as formerly you made two Crops in the last six Months.
So that with the hundred pounds you gained last year, you may now purchass seven or eight
slaves, or Servants; which may in all probability treble the first year. But put the case it
but only double, yet at the worst it may yield you (and all charges born) two hundred pounds
Sterlin.</P>
<P>Now we cannot otherwise conclude (if things suc∣ceed well) but that the third year will
double the second year by improvement, as above is exprest; and if so, then your Crop will
amount to four hundred pounds Sterlin.</P>
<P>And the fourth year doubles the third year, by rea∣son the <HI>Cocoa</HI> that was planted the
first year on the fif∣teen Acres of Land, may produce to the value of thir∣ty pounds Sterlin an
Acre; besides the encrease of <HI>To∣bacco,</HI> and clearing of more ground, together with
your encrease of Servants, and slaves; and planting of more <HI>Cacao</HI> Trees, which at
least will arise to eight hundred pounds sterlin, the fourth year.</P>
<P>The fifth year, in all Probability doubles the fourth; by reason the <HI>Cocoa</HI> that was
first planted, yeilds now to the value of sixty pound Sterling an Acre, as the se∣cond years
planted <HI>Cocoa</HI> yielded but thirty pounds per Acre. So that clearing of more ground, and
purcha∣sing more slaves, and Servants; your produce of <HI>Cocoa</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI>
clears you at least one thousand six hun∣dred pounds Sterlin, as now the price goes.</P>
<P>The sixth year you may very well clear three thousand pounds sterlin, and all charges
borne; by reason the <HI>Cocoa</HI> planted the first year, is now come to perfection, &amp; is
at its full height of bearing; Which in this Latitude may yield
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>one hundred ponnd Sterling an Acre. <HI>(viz.)</HI> the first fifteen Acres
which were Planted the first year. And the second years Plants Planted the second year, will
yield you sixty pound sterling, &amp; the third years Plants, as by the same calculation, may
yield you thirty pound Sterlin an Acre. So that by purchasing the more ser∣vants, and slaves,
you may if you please decline so much planting of Tobacco as formerly you did.</P>
<P>The seventh year you will have all your Land Planted with <HI>Cocoa;</HI> and that
encreasing, you need not plant a∣bove ten, or fifteen Acres of <HI>Tobacco</HI> this year,
amongst your <HI>Cocao;</HI> but you may Plant provisions amongst them for support and
maintenance of your self and Family. So that from that increase of your seventh years Crop,
you may hope, and expect by a modest computation, to clear from the said fifty Acres of Land,
at least five thousand pounds Sterling a year.</P>
<P>And now we come to the Reasons for this great im∣provement; you must consider, that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Trinidado, &amp;c.</HI> give among themselves one hundred pounds
Sterling, for a Nigro Slave, and yet the said slave will not stand his master in one
single penny, at the years end for his purchase. And all the labour and ser∣vice the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> imploys him in the year about, is on∣ly in <HI>Cocoa,</HI> and <HI>Spanish
Tobacco,</HI> in this our Latitude.</P>
<P>Now pray consider, that we can have Nigro Slaves brought and delivered to us at fifteen pound
sterling a head; by reason we have an open trade, and the <HI>Spani∣ard</HI> allows not of a
free trade. VVhere note the <HI>Spani∣ard</HI> pays sixpence, or more for every thing he wants;
when we can have the same for a single peny. That's one reason.</P>
<P>The second Reason is, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> cannot have any <HI>Tunage</HI> for goods from
old <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and
<PB N="42" REF="24"/>home again, for less then forty or fifty pounds sterling <HI>per Tun;</HI>
besides the Duties run very high. And we can have Freight for five or six pounds <HI>per
Tun,</HI> and no Duties from us to a free Port. VVhen therefore to consider and compute the
charge on either side, we pro∣fit by what we transport, six to one. VVhich makes the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> generally so poor in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and we ge∣nerally to flourish so
much the more.</P>
<P>The third reason is, that in a Ship of three hundred <HI>Tun,</HI> the Spaniard has seldom
less then two hundred men belonging to her; and the wages of each man comes at least to Fifty
Shillings Sterling <HI>per</HI> month: which in the whole amounts to five hundred pound a month,
barely for wages; then you are to Consider the month∣ly Provision to accomodate these men
cannot come to less then one hundred and sixty pound Sterlin, and ten months at six hundred
and sixty pound <HI>per</HI> Month, amounts to six thousand and five hundred pounds Sterlin
for ten Months. Moreover this Ship of three hundred Tun, seldom carries less then forty Pieces
of Ordinance, which with their Provisions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by modest computation takes up no
less room then one hundred and fifty Tun. So that the Ship in all Probability cannot bring home
more then one hundred and fifty tun of Merchants goods, and the fraight of these goods comes to
forty pound Sterlin a tun. So that by this Calculation they must be loosers at least six
hundred pound Sterlin, and at fourty five pound-<HI>per</HI> tun, to pay ware and tare of the Ship,
and mens wages. So that for the ships ware and tare it comes barely but to one hundred and fifty
pound Sterlin clear:</P>
<P>Now admit an <HI>English</HI> ship of three hundred tun, be bound for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and
suppose the fraight of this ship be at six pound sterlin <HI>per</HI> tun, this ship
shall make her voy∣age
<PB N="43" REF="24"/>better in eight months time then the <HI>Spaniard</HI> shall in ten Months;
now the fraight of the <HI>English</HI> ship comes to one thousand eight hundred pound
sterlin, and the Wages and Victuals of the said Ship at sixty pound <HI>per</HI> Month, comes
to four hundred and eighty pound ster∣lin, so that you see the Ship clears for her ware and
tare the sum of one thousand three hundred and twenty pound sterlin: See here therefore the
great difference.</P>
<P>The fourth and last reason is this; The King of <HI>Spain</HI> contracts with a body of
Merchants to furnish the <HI>West-Indies</HI> with four thousand <HI>Nigros</HI> every year;
and the <HI>Nigrillos</HI> or Merchants there engage to pay the King one hundred peices of Eight
Custom for each <HI>Ni∣gro</HI> slave brought unto them. VVhich comes to four hundred
thousand pieces of Eight by the year, which is paid to the said King, the King therefore
prohibits all Merchants, and others, for bringing <HI>Nigros</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies:</HI>
And each piece of Eight is valued at five shillings sterlin in <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but in the
<HI>Lee-ward Islands</HI> it goes for six.</P>
