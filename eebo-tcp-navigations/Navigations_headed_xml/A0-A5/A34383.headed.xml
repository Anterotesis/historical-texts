<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y last to you was of the 10th. of <HI>November</HI> past, (which, in regard we have had much Westerly Winds since) I hope ere this time you have re∣ceived; according to the best Information I had or could procure, I made bold to acquaint you with sundry Passages, that before the date there∣of, came to pass amongst us: I also sent you two of our Orders in Print by Order of the Council here; The one for the Confinement of our <HI>Neetop</HI> (i. e. <HI>Friend)</HI> Indians, the other for a general Fast throughout this Col∣lony: By the one you may see the great Care our Authority hath, as well to make a distinction visible, betwixt our Friends the Christian <HI>Indians,</HI> and our Enemies the Heathens, as also, to secure the one from injuries, and to lay the other open, and make them liable to the hand of Justice: By the other you may see what sence of the immediate hand of God upon us our Magistrates have; and truly <HI>Sir,</HI> we have great cause to bless the Lord for that we have such Magistrates and Councellers that we are so well assured do aime at the Glory of God, and the peace and welfare of his people in this Wilderness; that however the mighty hand of God is lifted up upon us, and he hath given Commission to the Sword to destroy, yet we are well sa∣tisfied there is nothing wanting that lyeth within the reach of their wisdom or strength: Wherefore in the midst of our troubles we comfort our selves in this, that we are satisfied they do what in them lyeth: I hope in some short time I may hear of your receipt thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> In my last I also gave you (at first) an Account of the Reasons of the Rise and Origin of these unhappy Wars, in which, my Information was not so perfect, but that there was somewhat amiss; although, at that time, the Account thereof was generally receiv'd, and the alteration is not much, only in some few particular circumstances: Wherefore, that you might be the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> more certain thereof, I shall give you an account wherein I missed, Thus: About six years since one <HI>Sosoman,</HI> (an <HI>Indian</HI>-Schollar and Minister) having spent some years in the Study of Divinity, being by that time judged capable of Preaching the Gospel, was by the Authority of <HI>Plymouth</HI> sent to Preach to King <HI>Philip;</HI> he with some seeming-kind of Devotion, heard him for a while at several times; and however his Zeal was in outward appearance, yet all that time, and a good while before, he, with several of his own men, had a Conspiracy to cut off the <HI>English</HI> thereabouts, and scrupled not to make the business known to <HI>Sosoman,</HI> as supposing he might be of great use to him, in the car∣rying on that bloody design; whereupon this <HI>Sosoman</HI> soon after makes this thing known to the Governor of <HI>New-Plymouth-Collony, Josiah Winslow</HI> Esq; King <HI>Philip</HI> suspecting he either would divulge, or had already made known this secret to the <HI>English,</HI> took Councel to kill this <HI>Sosoman;</HI> where∣fore in order thereunto, one day, as he sat fishing by a River-side, two or three <HI>Indians</HI> came and barbarously Murthered him in the place; where∣upon, as soon as the Governor and Councel of <HI>Plymouth</HI> heard thereof, sent and took the said Murtherers; as also a small Party went to King <HI>Philip</HI> and brought him and most of his chief men to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and there Examined them, and had several meetings in Consultation about the business; but King <HI>Philip</HI> behaved himself very uncivilly (like a Heathen,) however due proof could not be produced against him, and he nor his Men not having yet shed any English Blood after his entring into a League of Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> was dismist; only the Murtherers after a legal Condemnation were Hanged. Here lies the occasion of our present difference, which I have made bold to acquaint you of.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Towards the close of my last to you, I gave you an Account of what was done at <HI>Hatfield</HI> the 19th. of <HI>Octob.</HI> last; in which Fight the Heathens were so put to it, that they were forced to go to their last refuge, that is, the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> who I wrote you, word we feared every day more and more would prove perfidious to us; wherefore the Authority of the United Collonies having Intelligence that King <HI>Philip</HI> with his whole retinue, as well Women and Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did harbor themselves under the pro∣tection of <HI>Ninicroft,</HI> who is the King of the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> as also hearing that that same <HI>Sachem,</HI> that came to <HI>Boston</HI> about the end of <HI>September</HI> last, (being <HI>Ninicroft</HI>'s Eldest Son) is since Marryed to the <HI>Squaw Sachem;</HI> which Marriage doth signifie a near Alliance: and also seeing that what that <HI>Sa∣chem</HI> did agree unto with our Authority, when in <HI>Boston,</HI> is not at all regard∣ed by them, (for that <HI>Sachem</HI> sent word when he came home into his own Country, that <HI>Ninicroft</HI> would not agree to what he had done:) these things so falling out near the same time, put our Authority then in Coun∣cel upon some necessity of finding out a speedy way to remedy the same. But notwithstanding their perfideousness hitherto, yet about three weeks after, five <HI>Sachems</HI> came together from <HI>Ninicroft</HI> to <HI>Boston,</HI> and engaged that our Enemies, entertained by them, should be delivered up instantly; but nothing being done of what they promised, the Commissioners of the United Collonies, sitting in Councel here, (the several consid erations here exprest, with others moveing them thereto) in the first place published this following Remonstrance (here inserted <HI>verbatim)</HI> and ordered a Body of Souldiers,
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y"/> Horse and Foot to march hence; in order thereunto, on the 10th. of this Instant <HI>December,</HI> six Companies of Foot and Horse marched hence un∣to <HI>Seaconck:</HI> The number of the Souldiers were thus; Of <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>Plimouth</HI> Collonies 700. Foot and 200. Horse, and <HI>Connecticot</HI> Collony having 300. Foot and 100. Horse ready to meet them at <HI>New London,</HI> whereof Governour <HI>Josiah. Winslow</HI> is gone out General: From <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Collony is gone out in Command, Major <HI>Appleton</HI> of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> Captain <HI>James Oliver,</HI> Captain <HI>Samuel Moseley,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Nath. Davenport</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> Capt. <HI>Johnson</HI> of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Capt. <HI>Gardner</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Tho∣mas Prentice,</HI> Capt. of the Horse. These were Commanders of those seven Companies that marched hence. The 16th. Instant we had advice from them, that the Enemy had burnt Mr. <HI>Jeremiah Balls</HI> House at <HI>Narragan∣sett,</HI> and killed 18. Men, Women, and Children that were in it, and that they had taken 55. <HI>Indians,</HI> and killed 10. more, and burnt 150. Wigwams with the loss of four of our Men, and as many wounded. This exploit was performed by Capt. <HI>Prentice,</HI> a Capt. of the Horse.</P>
<P>The weather now being extream cold, having, both Frost and Snow in most places two foot, in many places three foot deep, we have as yet had nothing like to a Field Battel with the <HI>Indians,</HI> save that Fight we had at <HI>Hatfield,</HI> of which I gave you an Account of in my last, until these Soul∣diers went out last; since which time, by several Posts coming daily thence, as also by private Letters, I have this Account of this Fight in particular.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 19th. Instant, the General Mustered up the whole Ar∣my in <HI>November,</HI> as before, having with them three Ministers, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dudley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Buckley,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Nowel,</HI> at Capt. <HI>Smiths</HI> House, (the same Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> I told you in my last, that came to <HI>Boston</HI> with <HI>Ninnicroft</HI>'s Eldest Son a <HI>Sachem)</HI> whose dwelling is about four miles off the <HI>Narragansetts</HI> dwellings, and is now the strongest Garrison in those parts) and having given orders for a march, according to discretion, marched to∣wards the <HI>Narragansets</HI> Country (or Town) where finding no <HI>Indians,</HI> they were at a stand, not knowing which way to go in pursuit of the <HI>Indians;</HI> but however during their stay, their Capt. <HI>Prentice,</HI> with his Company disco∣vered some place under ground, wherein was Indian-Corn laid up in store by them; this encouraged them to look farther; whereupon in their search they found several good quantities of that grain in like manner, which after∣wards was conveyed to the Garrison. In the Afternoon of that <HI>Saturday,</HI> some of the Souldiers accidentally espied an <HI>Indian</HI> alone, whom they took and carried to the General, who upon his refusal to answer to those questions demanded, was ordered to be Hanged forthwith; whereupon the <HI>Indian</HI> to save his life, told them where the whole body of the <HI>Indians</HI> were together, as well King <HI>Philip,</HI> and all other Confederate <HI>Sagamores</HI> and <HI>Sachems</HI> with their whole retinue, as also the whole body of the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> being joyned all in a body in <HI>November,</HI> about 4500. <HI>Indian</HI> men, besides Wives and Children: Whereupon, keeping this <HI>Indian</HI> for their Guide, they having provisions with them, marched all night, the <HI>Indians</HI> being then 16. Miles distant from them, and that Night there fell a very hard Snow two or three foot deep, and with-all an extream hard Frost, so that some of our Men were frozen in their hands and feet, and thereby disabled for Service:
<PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y"/> The next day, about Noon, they come to a large Swamp, which by rea∣son of the Frost all the Night before, they were capable of going over (which else they could not have done) they forthwith in one body entered the said Swamp, and in the midst thereof was a piece of firm Land, of about three or four Acres of ground, whereon the <HI>Indians</HI> had built a kind of a Fort, being Palisado'd round, and within that a clay Wall, as also felled down a∣bundance of Trees to lay quite round the said Fort, but they had not quite finished the said work: The General placed Capt. <HI>Moseley</HI> in the Front, to enter the Fort, and the rest of the Companies were placed according to dis∣cretion: In their march they met with three <HI>Indians</HI> sent out as Scouts, whom they shot dead at sight thereof: as soon as ever the <HI>Indians</HI> saw our Army comeing, they shot as fast as ever they could, and so our Men did the like. Before our Men could come up to take possession of the Fort, the <HI>In∣dians</HI> had shot three Bullets through Capt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> whereupon he bled extreamly, and immediatly called for his Lieutenant, Mr. <HI>Edward Ting,</HI> and commited the charge of the Company to him, and desired him to take care of his Gun, and deliver it according to order, and immediatly died in the place; his Company were extreamly grieved at his death, in regard he was so courteous to them; for he being Commander of that Company, be∣longing to <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Watertown,</HI> &amp;c. was a Stranger to most of them; and at the time that he came to take possession of his Company, he made a very civil speech to them, and also gave them free liberty to choose their Serjeants themselves, which pleased them very well, and accordingly did so; and it is very probable the <HI>Indians</HI> might think that Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> was the General, because he had a very good Buff Suit on at that time, and therefore might shoot at him.</P>
<P>In a short time our Forces entred the Fort, Captain <HI>Moseley</HI> being in the Front, the <HI>Indians</HI> knowing him very well, many directed their shot to him, as he afterwards told the General that he believed he saw 50. aim at him: As soon as he and they had entred the Fort, he espied a heap of above 50. <HI>Indians</HI> lay dead in a corner, which the <HI>Indians</HI> had gathered together; as soon as ever our Men had entred the Fort, the <HI>Indians</HI> fled, our men killed many of them, as also of their Wives and Children, amongst which, an Indian Black-Smith (the only man amongst them) that fitted their Guns and Arrow-heads; and amongst many more Houses burnt his, as also demolished his Forge, and carried away his Tools; they fought with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and pursued them so long as was advantagious to them; then the General gave order to sound a Retreat, which was done according to order. The Retreat was no sooner beaten, and the Souldiers were in a Marching posture, before they were got all out of the Fort, a thousand fresh <HI>Indians</HI> set on our Men, but in an hours time the <HI>Indians</HI> were forced to Retreat and Flie: Our Men, as near as they can judge, may have killed about 600. Indian Men, besides Women and Children: Many more <HI>Indians</HI> were killed which we could have no account of, by reason that they would carry away as many dead <HI>Indians</HI> as they could. Our men be∣fore they had been set on by the fresh <HI>Indians,</HI> had set fire to most of the Waggons in and about the Fort (which were near 1000. in all,) how ma∣ny
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> were burnt down they could not tell positively, only thus; That they Marched above three miles from the Fort by the light of the Fires. Here is an Account of the number of <HI>English</HI>-men slain by the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Engagement.</P>

<P>We wanting good Accomodation for our Wounded men, our General ordered them to be removed to <HI>Road-Island,</HI> where they have good Quar∣ters provided, and care taken for their Recovery.</P>
<P><HI>Ninegret</HI> the old <HI>Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> hath lately, with a small Party of <HI>Indians</HI> separated himself from the rest of his People, disowning their Actions, and all that joyn with King <HI>Philip,</HI> and professes himself a true Friend to the <HI>English</HI> Interest.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<P>It may not be amiss to acquaint you that the Night before the Fight was, and all that day, and the night after, there sell such an extraordinary Snow that the like hath not been known for many years; and in regard that we had no Post come from our Army for 4. or 5, days, many fears arose a∣mongst us that our men were lost either by the Enemy, or the Snow, which made many an heart-ake amongst us: But so it was, that which we feared would spoil us, did very much disable the Enemy; for we having burnt down almost all their Wigwams, as also all their Corn that we could find, they thereby have less shelter and less subsistence left them, which misery of theirs is much aggravated by that great Snow. The Fight being over, our men Retreated to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s House, where the Noble General gave Order that the Wounded and Sick should first of all be cared for, which was done accordingly; and that they might have the better Accomodation in the House, the General himself lay in a Barn belonging to the said House.

<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> supposing that <HI>Hatfield,</HI> a Town on <HI>Conecticot</HI>-River, was very thin of men; he drew together 7 or 800. of his <HI>Indians,</HI> among which they had several Horses, and suddenly entred the Town on the 19th. of <HI>October,</HI> 1675. which after they had set on Fire in three places, they di∣vided themselves into two bodies, and began to act several Cruelties on the Inhabitants: The <HI>English</HI> by their dilligence soon quenched the fires; and making up a body of 200. men, most of which were newly come into the Town, they fell on the <HI>Indians</HI> with a great deal of fury, and after two hours Fight, compelled the <HI>Indians</HI> to leave the Town with more hast than they entred; the English having slain about 100. <HI>Indians,</HI> with very little loss to themselves, pursued the rest to the River-side, where many were drowned that could not swim to the farther side. After this Fight, <HI>Philip</HI> and his <HI>Indians</HI> fled to the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> which caused the Counsel of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> to publish in Print this Remonstrance before spoken of</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Although you cannot be Ignorant, how studious this Govern∣ment hath been to preserve Peace in this Colony, and hath taken up and Compromised diverse Quarrels that have Risen between our Selves, our Neighbours, &amp; the <HI>Indians;</HI> And thereby at several times prevented those Calamities wherewith we are now Pressed: Yet to satisfie you that the same Mind, and the same Endeavours are continued in the present Government, we have thought it necessary to let you understand the Rise and Progress of our present Troubles, with our endeavours to have prevented the same.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>IN</HI> June <HI>last, we were Certified by our Friends and Confederates of</HI> Plimouth, <HI>that</HI> Philip <HI>the Sachem of</HI> Mount. Hope <HI>was in Arms, and had solicited all the</HI> Indians <HI>to joyn with him against the English; and withal, they desired our Assistance to Suppress him: which we by the Articles of Confederation could not deny, and therefore applied our selves to Raise some Force for their Assistance: but were stil desirous to pre∣vent a war with the</HI> Indians; <HI>and therefore upon a for∣mer Experience of a good Effect wrought upon the said</HI> Philip, <HI>we resolved to use the same means,</HI> viz. <HI>sending Messengers from hence to</HI> Philip <HI>to Treat with him, hoping of the like Issue, which upon the like case about four years since we by Gods good hand obtain∣ed. But our Messengers arriving at</HI> Swanzy, <HI>in their way towards Philip, found divers</HI> English <HI>Murthered on the Road, and were informed by the</HI> English <HI>there, of divers hostilities of the</HI> Indians, <HI>which rendred our</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/> <HI>Design and their Negotiation hopeless: Vpon which they returned, &amp; informed us as abovesaid. where∣upon our Forces began their march in Aid of our Friends at</HI> Plymouth; <HI>and having driven</HI> Philip <HI>from his Country, we being informed that the</HI> Narragansets <HI>harboured his women, and aided him with men, we ordered our Souldiers to march to</HI> Narraganset, <HI>in or∣der to keep them quiet, and prevent their succouring or harbouring the Enemy: where, after some delay, they were drawn to consent to our demands, promi∣sing neither to entertain nor assist our Enemies which they since confirmed in a Treaty with the Commissio∣ners of the Colonies; Further engaging that they would deliver all those of Philips party, that upon his Rout near</HI> Scatoneck, <HI>or since, were fled to them; but have failed in every particular.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You may also take notice, That before any of our Souldiers marched to</HI> Mount-Hope, <HI>we were very careful to understand the state of the</HI> Nipnet-Indians, <HI>to prevent Philips design, &amp; secure those</HI> Indians, <HI>&amp; therefore dispatched two Messengers well known to them, to certifie them of Philips motion &amp; of our desire to keep amity &amp; friendship with them, according to the Cove∣nants made with them long since, no ways Violated on our part. And by the said Messengers, received fair returns from the most of them, being in 10. or 12. Plan∣tations. Some of them pretended fear of us: For their further satisfaction (when our Forces were sent out against Philip) we to satisfie &amp; secure them, sent them by</HI> Ephraim Curtice, <HI>a Declaration under the Publick Seal, that we had no design or intent to disturb them, or any other</HI> Indians <HI>that would remain in their Plan∣tations peaceably: which Message &amp; Messenger was evilly treated by many of them then Assembled, &amp; the Messenger much endangered by the younger men, and not with any satisfaction by their Sachems, as the Event shewed, though at that present more mode∣rately received.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
<P><HI>Soon after this dispatch &amp; before</HI> Philips <HI>flying from</HI> Pocasser, <HI>and march up towards the</HI> Nipnet <HI>Country, some of the said</HI> Nipnet-<HI>Indians Assaulted &amp; slew divers of our people at</HI> Mendam; <HI>whereupon Captain</HI> Hutchin∣son <HI>with a small Guard, was sent up to the said</HI> Nipnet-Indians, <HI>(if possible to keep them quiet) who arriving at</HI> Quabaog; <HI>whereabouts was a Randezvous of the</HI> Indians, <HI>and having sent to them, they promised to meet him in a certain place, whither he at the time repair∣ing, found not the Indians; and being incouraged by the English of</HI> Quabaog, <HI>that the Indians were peaceable,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>he advanced forward towards the place of the</HI> Indians <HI>Randezvous to Treat them: But in the way, was by Ambuscado treacherously way-laid, by which himself, with several others were wounded and slain, the</HI> Eng∣lish <HI>of</HI> Quabaog <HI>immediatly Assaulted, and the Town, except one House, totally destroyed; at which time, as we understand,</HI> Philip <HI>also with his broken party came up to the said Indians, &amp; upon the first, or immediately before the arrival of the Forces, we sent up for the Re∣lief of those of</HI> Quabaog, <HI>Philip and his whole crew re∣treated (as we then feared, and afterwards were in∣formed) towards</HI> Conecticot-<HI>River, from whence Re∣cruiting himself with Ammunition from</HI> Albany, <HI>and with men, partly from the treacherous</HI> Indians <HI>about</HI> Hadly <HI>and</HI> Spring-field, <HI>to have prosecuted his first design to Ruine and destroy the</HI> English. <HI>And notwithstand∣ing all the opposition of our Forces, hath done much mischief and spoil; and since the Repulse he received at</HI> Hatfield, <HI>withdrew into the</HI> Nipnet. <HI>Country, and since that (as we understand) towards the</HI> Narragan∣sets, <HI>who we do conclude, have favoured, abetted, and assisted him therein; and by entertaining and harbouring our Enemies, have dealt falsly and perfi∣diously with us: whereby we find our selves necessa∣rily Ingaged, with the Consent, Advice and Assi∣stance of the rest of the Colonies, in a War with them,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="7"/> <HI>as well as with <HI>Philip,</HI> unless they prevent the same by a timely Complyance and Performance, and Se∣curity for the future: for the managing and carrying on whereof, we hope for, and expect (as we have hi∣therto had) the Assistance of all his Majesties Sub∣jects of this Colony in their respective Capacities, in the just Defence of the Glory of God, the Honour, De∣fence &amp; safety of our King, Country, and our Selves, from the Subtilty, Rage, and Treacherous Attempt of our Barbarous Enemies.</HI></P>

<HEAD>BOSTON In <HI>NEW-ENGLAND, February</HI> the 8th. 1675/6.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last to you beared Date the 21st. of <HI>December,</HI> 1675. wherein I gave you a true Account of the state of our Affairs in <HI>New-England,</HI> particularly of the Engagement of our Forces with the <HI>Indians</HI> on the 19th, of <HI>December,</HI> 1675. and the number of the Slain and Wounded. I shall now continue my Intelligence according to your request, and my promise, and give you a true Account of all trans∣actions here (worth your information) since the foresaid <HI>19th.</HI> of <HI>De∣cember.</HI></P>
<P>Our wounded men (thanks be to God) are most of them pretty well re∣covered, and only Captain <HI>Sealy</HI> is dead that I can hear of. By some Indian-Prisoners, lately taken, we are certainly informed that they had 355. men killed out-right, besides several burnt in their Waggons, with Women and Children, and 180. wounded, many of which are since dead, particularly <HI>Sachem Quanepins</HI> Brother, who was a man of great Com∣mand among the <HI>Indians.</HI> That Night the <HI>Indians</HI> left the place where the Fight was, and Retreated 5. miles farther into the Country. <HI>Ninecroft</HI> an old Sachem in that Country, who hath hitherto continued Neuter, and neither assisted the <HI>Indians</HI> nor us, sent some of his men the next day, and Buried the dead <HI>Indians,</HI> and as many of the <HI>English</HI> as were left behind dead.</P>
<P>On the 23. and 24th. of <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> sent some Commissioners to our General to Treat of Peace, which they had no mind to conclude; but we soon perceived it was only to prevent our falling upon them, and to gain themselves more time to remove their Army and Provision twenty miles farther into the Country, to some Rocks where we could not get at them without great danger. Although our General knew this, he was desi∣rous to keep the Treaty on foot by reason the Forces of the Collony of
<PB N="14" REF="8" MS="y"/> <HI>Connecticot</HI> had left our Army, and we at home to recruit, and those sup∣plies from <HI>Boston,</HI> that are daily expected, not being yet Arrived, our Army was not in a condition to make any new attempts on the Enemy; but had not the <HI>Connecticot</HI> Forces left our Army, we had hopes that we might have compelled the Enemy to yield to our mercy. During this time, our Forces foraged the Country, and brought in great quantities of Indian-Corn to the Army.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> the Forces from <HI>Boston</HI> that were sent to Reinforce our Army arrived at <HI>Narraganset,</HI> where our Army then lay: the extream coldness of the Season had mightily incommended them in their march; they lost Eleaven of their Men on their march, that were frozen to death, and brought many others sick and disheartned with the ex∣tream coldness of the Season: they were joyfully received by the Army; and soon after them the Connecticot Forces came to the Army, having Re∣inforced their Companies with some fresh men, and brought with them <HI>Unkus</HI> an Old <HI>Sachem,</HI> who dwelt in the <HI>Connecticot</HI> jurisdiction; he brought with him some Companies of his own <HI>Indians</HI> to the assistance of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The Winter being now broke up, and the Snow and Ice all gone, our Army consisting in all of 1600. men, began their March to the Rocks, where the <HI>Indians</HI> were fled for protection; but in their way, they had in∣telligence that 300. <HI>Indians</HI> had been at <HI>Patuxit,</HI> an English Plantation on the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Bay, where they had burnt Mr. <HI>Carpenters</HI> Corn and Hay, and all his Houses, except his dwelling House, which likewise they had set on fire, but it was again quenched by some <HI>English</HI> that were in it: They likewise drove away with them 180. Sheep, 50. head of large Cattle, and 15. Horses: Besides, they took much Cattel from young Mr. <HI>Harris,</HI> and killed a Negroe-Servant of his; and having done this mischief, returned home with their Booty.</P>
<P>Our Army being Arrived in <HI>Pumham</HI>'s Countlry, an <HI>Indian Sachem,</HI> we burnt his Town, and had a small Reincounter with some of his <HI>Indians,</HI> where we wounded his chief Captain <HI>Quaquash</HI> on the knee, and killed five of his Men, and had four of our <HI>Connecticot</HI> men wounded.</P>
<P>Our Scouts brought in Prisoner one <HI>Tift,</HI> a Renegadoe English man, who having received a deserved punishment from our General, deserted our Army, and fled to the Enemy, where he had good entertainment, and was again sent out by them with some of their Forces; he was shot in the Knee by our Scouts, and then taken before he could discharge his Musket, which was taken from him and found deep charged, and laden with Slugs: He was brought to our Army, and Tryed by a Counsel of War, where he pretended that he was taken Prisoner by the <HI>Indians,</HI> and by them com∣pelled to bear Arms in their Service; but this being proved to be false, he was Condemned to be Hanged and Quartered, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Our Army beat the <HI>Indians</HI> from the foresaid Rocks, and pursued them almost as far as <HI>Quabog,</HI> in which pursuit we killed about 60. or 70. of them, and found many of the Matts scattered in the way, with which they cover their Houses, which we suppose they could not carry with them by rea∣son
<PB N="15" REF="8"/> of our close pursuit. Some Prisoners taken from them, inform us, that their body consists of 4000. whereof 1800. were Fighting Men, half of which wanted Arms, that they were in great want of Powder, and greater want of Provisions.</P>
<P>Provision growing scarce in our Army, and the Enemy having cleansed the Country of things that might tend to our Relief, our General resolved to pursue them no farther, but to hasten homewards, which accordingly was done with what speed we could; but the scarcity of Victuals daily en∣creasing, we were forced to kill several of our Horses for our Sustenance. Our General dismist the <HI>Connecticot</HI>-Men, and sent them home the nearest way, and Old <HI>Unkus</HI> and his <HI>Indians</HI> along with them. They proved very faithful in our Service, and were well treated by us. Our General having left 60. men in Garrison at Mr. <HI>Smiths</HI> House, at <HI>Narraganset,</HI> where the Fight was on the 19th. of <HI>December,</HI> came home by the way of <HI>Malborough:</HI> Many of our Souldiers are troubled with the <HI>Flux,</HI> of which our General is one.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> hath not yet been at <HI>Narraganset,</HI> as we feared; but is retired with his Men near <HI>Albany,</HI> where he hath kept his Winter Quarters. We very much fear the <HI>Indians</HI> falling on our Out-Towns this Spring, which if they should, would extreamly damnifie us.</P>
<P>Our Friend Mr. <HI>H. O.</HI> went out again into the Army, before he was cured of his old wound, and hath received another on his Elbow-joynt, which we fear will cause him to lose his Arm, if not his Life. Our Enemies are yet very Unmerciful, sparing no persons life that they can Master.</P>
<P>I see no likelihood of any Peace, but much fear our Wars are far from an end: Our Trade to <HI>Virginia</HI> is quite decayed, not one Vessel having gone from hence thither since the Wars began; but by a small Vessel Arrived here from thence, we are informed that the <HI>Indians</HI> have fallen unexpected on the <HI>English,</HI> and destroyed many of them, and done much harm with very little loss to themselves, but this report finds very little credit with us; by the next Shiping I shall (God willing) give you a farther Account of our Affairs, and in the mean time shall neglect no opportunity of informing my self of the transactions of these Parts, being sensible how much you have obliged</P>

<P>I Thought it needful to acquaint you that on the 21th. day of <HI>March,</HI> Anno. 1621. the <HI>English</HI> made a League of Peace with <HI>Massasoiet,</HI> who was Grand father to the present King <HI>Philip,</HI> on the following Terms and Conditions,</P>
<P N="1">1. That neither he nor any of his should injure or do hurt to any of our people.</P>
<P N="2">2. That if any of his did any harm to any of ours, that then he should send the Offender unto us for punishment.</P>
<P N="3">3. That if any <HI>English</HI> took any Goods belonging to the said <HI>Massasoit,</HI> or any of his <HI>Indians,</HI> they should restore them again: and he obliged himself to do the like.</P>
<P N="4">4. That if any of the Neighbours of the said <HI>Massasoiet</HI> should make war against him, the <HI>English</HI> should assist him: and he obliged himself to assist the English on the like occasion.</P>
<P N="5">5. That he should inform his Neighbours and Confederates of these Co∣venants, that they might be careful of wronging either party.</P>
<P N="6">6. That where any of his <HI>Indians</HI> came amongst the <HI>English,</HI> they should have no Bows or Arrows, or any other Arms with them.</P>
<P N="7">7. That in so doing, our Soveraign Lord King <HI>James</HI> should esteem him as his Friend and Ally.</P>
<P>These Articles were agreed on to the good satisfaction and content of both Parties, and <HI>Massasoiet</HI> was content to become the Subject of our Soveraign Lord King <HI>James,</HI> his Heirs and Successors, and gave to the English all the Lands adjacent, and to their Heirs for ever.</P>
<P>On the 25th. day of <HI>September,</HI> in the year 1639. this great Sachem <HI>Massasoiet,</HI> with <HI>Moanam</HI> his Son, came personally to the Court held at <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and desired that the League and Confederacy for∣merly made with the Government of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> might stand and remain in∣violable, and the said <HI>Massasoiet</HI> and his Son <HI>Moanam</HI> did faithfully promise to keep and observe the Covenants and Conditions therein expressed and contained; and that neither of them should needlesly or unjustly raise any quarrel, or do any wrong to other Natives, or provoke them to War against them; and that neither of them should give, sell, or convey any of their Lands, Territories, or Possessions whatsoever, to any person or persons whomsoever, without the privity and consent of the Government of <HI>Pli∣mouth:</HI> All which conditions the said <HI>Massasoiet</HI> and <HI>Moanam</HI> his Son, for themselves and their Successors, did then faithfully promise to observe and keep; and the whole Court, in the name of the whole Government for each Town respectively, did then ratifie and confirm the aforesaid ancient League and Consederacy; and also did further promise to the said <HI>Massasoiet</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="9"/> and to <HI>Moanam</HI> his Son, that they shall and will from time to time defend them and their Successors when need and occasion shall require, against all such as shall rise up against them, to wrong or oppress them unjustly.</P>
<P><HI>Anno.</HI> 1662. There being occasion of some suspition of a Plot intended by the <HI>Indians</HI> against the English; <HI>Philip;</HI> the Son of the aforesaid <HI>Moanam,</HI> and Grandson of <HI>Massasoiet,</HI> and now the implacable Enemy of the English, made his personal appearance at the Court held at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> August the 6th. and did there earnestly desire the continuance of that amity and friendship that had formerly been between the Governours of <HI>Plimouth</HI> and his De∣ceased Father and Grand-father; and for that end the said <HI>Philip</HI> doth for himself and his Successors, desire that they might for ever remain subject to the King of England, his Heirs and Successors; and doth faithfully promise and engage that he and his will truly and exactly observe and keep inviolable such conditions as have formerly been by his Predecessors made; and par∣ticularly, that he will not at any time needlesly or unjustly provoke or raise war with any of the Natives, nor at any time give, sell, or any way dispose of any Lands to him or them appertaining; to any Strangers, or to any without our privity or appointment; but will in all things endeavour to carry it peaceably &amp; inoffensively towards the English. And the said Court did then also express their willingness to continue with him and his the above∣said Friendship; and do on their part promise that they will afford them such friendly assistance by advice and otherwise, as they justly may; and we will require our <HI>English</HI> at all times to carry it friendly towards them: in witness whereof, the said <HI>Philip</HI> the Sachem hath set to his hand; as also his Unkle, and witnessed unto by sundry other of his chief men.</P>

<P>In the said year, 1621. the <HI>Narroganset Indians</HI> sent a Messenger to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> with a bundle of Arrows tyed together with a Snakes skin, which he understood was a threatning and a challenge. Upon which the Governour sent them this Answer; That if they loved War ra∣ther than Peace, they might begin when they would; he had done them no wrong, neither did he fear them, nor should they find him unprovided; and by another Messenger sent the Snakes skin back with Bullets in it, but they would not receive them, but sent them back again; but the <HI>Indians</HI> were better advised than to quarrel with the English at that time.</P>

<HEAD>BARBADOES, Spickes-Bay, <HI>November</HI> the 30th. 1675.</HEAD>
<P>MY last to you was an information of a bloody Tragedy intended a∣gainst his Majesties Subjects here in this Island, by the Heathen the Negroes, which was by the Providence of God miraculously discovered eight days before the intended Murder should have been acted: The manner of the discovery was thus; A Negroe man be∣longing to Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> Senior, being absented from his said Master, among se∣veral other Negroes who had a hand in the Plot: In a Councel among them, they did contrive that the Negroes belonging to each several Planta∣tion, should in the dead time of the Night fall on at the sound of the Allarm, which was to be given in one hour, and at several places through the Island, which Negroes so allotted was to kill their Master and Mistresses with their Overseers; this foresaid Negroe of Mr. <HI>Halls</HI> (though one of the chief Plotters) yet having a respect to his Master, would by no means consent to the killing of his Master, and upon refusal was much threatned; and being afraid of his Life, makes his escape and returns home; and one day, which was a little before the prosecution of the murder, was over-heard (telling the Plot to his Country-men) by a Negro Woman, who waited and attend∣ed on her Mistress, which the Negro Woman immediately reveals. The Negroe man being taken to examination, confest the whole truth, which was immediately told the Governour, who appointed some Captains to raise their Companies for depressing the Rebels, which accordingly was done, and abundance taken &amp; apprehended, &amp; since put to death, and the rest kept in a more stricter manner; yet <HI>Jethuran</HI> like, we have kicked a∣gainst God, and slighted the mercy of so great a deliverance. The man∣ner of their proceedings I wrote to your more at large; and as the Lord did deliver us from the Tyranny and barbarous cruelty of Savage Heathens, and we still remaining obstinate, &amp; refusing to return to him by Repentance; the Lord hath taken us into his own hand to chastise us, which chastilements lyeth very heavy on the poorer sort, and none of the Rich excepted. Sir, upon the last day of <HI>August</HI> last, about six of the Clock in the Afternoon, there did arise a Violent Storm of Wind &amp; Rain out of the North West, and continuing between the North and the South so violent, that before the hour of Twelve at Night, there was not twenty Houses standing in our Pa∣rish, in which there is above three hundred Families, and those that did stand, much damnified; our Neighbouring Parishes tasting of the same Cup. There is kill'd out-right (by the falling of Houses) in this Parish, thirty seven, and many more is since, with the violence of the wind and cold, dead, and many lying in their beds of sickness; and as to our Ships,
<PB N="20" REF="11"/> all drove Ashore to pieces, except one of the Kings Men of War, which went to Sea, and returning next day after the Storm was ceased, did pro∣test to the Governour, that twenty Leagues off there was no Storm, for he carried his Top sail half Mass high. Our fellow-subjects in <HI>New-England,</HI> have the 28th. of the same month tasted of the same Cup, and was very hard put to it this last Summer by one King <HI>Philip</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> King, who hath Re∣volted without cause given him by the <HI>English,</HI> neither will he shew any reason why; but being by an Embassador from the Governour of <HI>Boston,</HI> demanded why he would maintain the War, refused to Treat with the Em∣bassador, telling him, <HI>The Governour was but a Subject, and that he would not Treat except his Brother King</HI> Charles <HI>of</HI> England <HI>were there:</HI> There is abundance of Families destroyed, besides those kill'd in the War; but it is very much hoped this Winter they will be Routed; the reason is, because they have no Woods nor Bushes to shelter in, which is a great help to a Flying-Army, such as they are, for they will not bide any pitch Battel. Our Bre∣thren in <HI>Virginia</HI> had been hard put to it this last Summer, if it had not been for the Relief of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>New York,</HI> which makes it the harder with us here: pray God mend it.</P>
<P>By the tempestuous Wind, and the violent raging of the Sea, which hath much over-flowed our banks, and incroacht upon the Land, here are many Houses lost; among which mine was in number, where I saved no∣thing to cover us from the violence of the Storm but what was on our backs. Pray God that I may make a sanctified use of the Chastisement, because the Lord hath not given over our Life to Death.
