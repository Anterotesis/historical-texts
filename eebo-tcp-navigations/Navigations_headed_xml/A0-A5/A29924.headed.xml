<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Present you the
vast body of the
Spanish Mo∣narchy,
which,
though it hath spread its roots
into many and distant Pro∣vinces,
is but of late growth,
having but little before the last
age first aspired, not only to a
competition with the two anti∣ently
<PB REF="3"/>
ballancing powers of
Christendom, <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> (for two they were
when <HI>France</HI> depended not on
<HI>England)</HI> but the Empire of
the World. Our near concern∣ments
either in peace or war
with it, rendring it very neces∣sary
to be known to us, I am wil∣ling
to shew it you in such par∣ticular
remarks of the people
and Countrey, as I think you
have not yet seen, with some∣thing
of observation on its
sodain advance, and almost
as sodain decay; so that it
is no longer a competitor
with the other two, but
<PB REF="3"/>
so much fallen from it,
it could scarcely any longer
subsist, did not the moderation
and justice of one of those
Monarchs, oblige him ra∣ther
to joyn in supporting
its Throne, then enjoy his
share of the many advantages,
his maritime power and scitu∣ation
of his Dominion, might
reasonably promise by the fall
of it; especially in regard by
sending abroad he shall not
need to fear such a depopu∣lation
as it suffers under, when
his doors shall be opened by
Acts of Naturalization and
Registers, to admit and secure
<PB REF="4"/>
such as (out of considerati∣on
of the fertility of his Coun∣trey,
temperature of its Air,
and convenience for Trade)
will abundantly supply what
may be so exhausted.</P>
<P>The time of taking this sur∣vey
sufficiently discovers it
self in it, and though some
years since relates to several ve∣ry
modern transactions of Chri∣stendom
of the highest concern,
as the English rebellion, renun∣ciation
of the Queen of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
and imprisonment of the
Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> neither
have any changes very conside∣rable
since happened to <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
either in its Government, Cu∣stoms,
or Negotiations.</P>
<P>You have in it a clear pro∣spect
of decay of Power, with
increase of Wealth, which
shews you are not undone by
scarcity (whether real or
pretended) of those adored
Metals for which this People
have sold themselves and aban∣doned
their Countrey, whilest
you abound in all things else
that contribute either to use
or pleasure, and they (though
Masters of the Fountains of
them) are indeed as indigent
and miserable as you fancy your
selves to be in the want of
<PB REF="5"/>
them alone. It makes no less
evident that when a Nation
(especially its Nobility and
Gentry) contemns or neglects
Arms, it is at the highest, if not
declining. If it be a little Sa∣tirical
as to the haughtiness and
singularity of that People, it
hath also something of Pane∣geric
as to several of their Vir∣tues,
without which yet I sup∣pose
it might be tolerated, our
Press having formerly made
as bold with most of the other
Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> as they
with us.</P>

<HEAD>A
JOURNEY
INTO
SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen we left <HI>Italy,</HI> we resolved for
<HI>Spain;</HI> but because <HI>M. P.</HI> intend∣ing
his Son should take that Jour∣ney
with us, had ordered him to
expect us at <HI>Monpellier,</HI> whither
he had commanded him to repair, from the house
of a Gentleman of <HI>Xaintonge,</HI> where he had resided
some months, we were obliged to tarry for him.
He came not till the later end of <HI>December,</HI> the
extremity of which season pressing us to spend
the Winter there, we deferred our departure till
the Spring: and the weather in <HI>Languedoc</HI> being
pleasant in March, we went away the 6th of that
month. I shall not concern my self in describing
what we saw in that most agreeable Province,
nor in repeating what we learned that was consi∣derable,
whilst we traversed it almost from one
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
end to the other; nor yet say any thing of <HI>Gas∣cony,</HI>
through which we passed; nor of <HI>Bayonne,</HI>
where we took our leaves of <HI>France.</HI> Having
travail'd those parts only as they lay in our way
to <HI>Spain,</HI> I shall reserve all my curiosity for it,
and not charge my Table-book with any obser∣vations
till I come to the Frontiers of that King∣dom.
That I may not neglect many particulars
I learned of the Government, Customs, and pre∣sent
Condition of the Imperious Nation that in∣habits
it, I will here make an Extract of what I
scattered in several Papers during our abode at
<HI>Madrid:</HI> to put which into method, were to
unravel confusion it self; every thing shall there∣fore
have its place, as I saw or heard it; and if
some be repeated more than once, it is because I
design not a polished work, but to give liberty to
my discourse according to Time, Place, Persons,
Companies, and Entertainments, and such refle∣ctions
as have presented from them; not
confining my self to what I saw, or happened to
me, or my Company, but enlarging to what was
told us, having ever endeavoured to get the best
informations possible. It ought not to seem
strange if in some places I happen to speak un∣truths
without lying, and in others to wander
without knowing I am out of the way, and de∣voting
my Book to those only that have seen its
foundations laid, and materials gathered toge∣ther,
to serve us as memorials of part of that time
which for six years we employed in studying the
World in its great School, which is Travail: The
mistakes and errors made either by me, or such
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
as I conversed with, will not to them appear very
considerable or uneasie to be effaced as soon as
discovered: and if it accidentally happen into o∣ther
hands, they may make choice of what is
weighty and certain, leaving what seems light
and doubtful, without any just cause of complaint
against me on account of that which I write not
for their sakes. I have nevertheless endeavoured
to make as few errors as possible, and what I set
down at night according to the several Objects
and Companies of the day, I overlook'd next
morning, and made farther enquiry of such per∣sons
as I thought likely to disabuse me if ill in∣formed,
and give me clearer light if what I had
received were imperfect. According to this
method I have (better or worse) satisfied my cu∣riosity
in examining this grave and haughty Na∣tion
at its own home, since it seldom goes abroad
unless to command others, and secure its King
of their obedience by Garrisons and Colonies sent
into all parts of his Dominions in the new and old
World, and by the Governments and Magistra∣cies
he bestows upon it, with an intire exclusion
of the Inhabitants of those Countries to which
he distributes them.</P>
<P>Resolving to enter by way of <HI>St. Sebastian,</HI>
which is the most easie, we lodged at the last
Town of <HI>France</HI> called <HI>St. John de Luz.</HI> It is the
Seat of Commerce between the two Frontiers,
and may pass for a good City, being large, well
built, and rich: Its Mariners are esteemed and
employed in fishing for Cods, and Whales; and
we found Dutch men there that had hired fifty to
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
be made use of at <HI>New-found-land.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as we had passed <HI>Baione</HI> we perceived
the humour of the people to incline to that of
their Neighbourhood, being insolent and little
complying with strangers: the women in passing
the Streets cast their Coats over their heads, and
so to cover their cheeks discover their buttocks.
The next day we wanted but two leagues to the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Dominion, and at a good distance discern∣ed
<HI>Fontarabia,</HI> a Fort at the falling of <HI>Bidassao</HI> in∣to
the sea: This River, or rather Torrent, sepa∣rates
the two Kingdoms; it is pretty broad at the
Ferry, the Country thereabouts being fenny, and
ebs and flows with the Sea: at low water it is in
many places fordable. <HI>Andaie</HI> a little Town or
Village is seated on its bank, right over against
<HI>Fontarabia,</HI> and separated from it only by that
stream: but we were fain to go higher to seek
the Ferry-boat, and were troubled how to find
it, having been wrong directed by the Post∣master,
who does all ill offices he can to those
that travail on their own horses: The <HI>Toll</HI> paid
by the Boats goes half to the <HI>French,</HI> and half to
the <HI>Spanish,</HI> one of them receiving it of such as
pass into <HI>Spain,</HI> and the other of those that tra∣vail
into <HI>France,</HI> but both of them equally squeez∣ing
the Passenger. These Frontiers have no less
Communication than if there were no war be∣tween
the two Nations; and it is well for them
it is so; for otherwise an universal desolation
would follow. The Country is barren and moun∣tainous,
producing nothing but Iron, as well that
which belongs to <HI>France,</HI> as that which is pos∣sessed
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> which is the greatest part▪
It is called <HI>Biscai:</HI> the language is understood on¦ly
by the Inhabitants, and so poor that one word
hath diverse significations, so that it cannot
without difficulty be made use of in Commerce:
None write it, and the Children at School learn
French or Spanish, as they are subject to either
King.</P>
<P>It does not a little surprise, when having pas∣sed
<HI>Bidassao,</HI> one is no more understood without
speaking Spanish, when a moment before French
was intelligible. Half a quarter of a league further
is <HI>Iron,</HI> the first Town belonging to the King of
<HI>Spain;</HI> they neither demand Passport nor Ac∣count
of any's business; and one would think
there were neither warr nor distrust; only the
Alcalde came for two Reals as a due belonging to
him: but such as return and pass into <HI>France</HI> are
not used with the like indifference: We were
entertained at the Posthouse, much as we had
formerly been in <HI>Italy</HI> on the way to <HI>Naples,</HI> but
more slenderly: little Dishes with little bits of
meat, made us despair of filling our bellies; but
at last one after another enow were brought to
satisfie us. When the reckoning came they flee∣ced
us, and we were forced to give four Crowns
for a Meal that was not worth one. Over several
Mountains, and by a way very rough and stony,
we got that night to lye at <HI>St. Sebastians,</HI> where
we arrived before we were aware, it being co∣vered
by a great bank of sand, which passed, the
Town appears at the foot of a Mountain that
keeps off the sea, though she embraces it almost
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
on all sides, and enters far enough to make a Ha∣ven;
but for greater safety to Ships, there is a
Redout in form of a Basin, they riding at the
Town side, and foot of the Mountain, where
they seem secure from storms, though we were
told some have risen to that height that they have
broken in pieces such as anchored there.</P>
<P>Greater Vessels cannot enter, the water serv∣ing
only for Barks and Shallops: Ships of Warr
ride a quarter of a league lower, towards <HI>Fonta∣rabia,</HI>
where is the Arsenal for the Oceans Fleet,
at present in no very good condition. It returned
from <HI>Bourdenux</HI> much weather-beaten, and for
want of money nothing is done towards refit∣ting
it.</P>
<P>Before <HI>St. Sebastian</HI> there is a great Ship on
the Stocks intended for Admiral: it will be a
stately Vessel if ever finished: we were told it
had been long in the condition in which we saw
it, and that more money had been spent about it
than would have served for a dozen such Fabricks,
of which the greatest part became a prey to the
Overseers.</P>
<P><HI>Bilbo</HI> and <HI>St. Sebastian</HI> are the principal Ha∣vens
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath on the Ocean;
<HI>Corugna</HI> also is spoken of, where the Marquis of
<HI>St. Cruz</HI> tarried somewhat too long, whilest re∣volted
<HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> for want of his Succors, was
ready to return to its Kings obedience: he could
not have chosen a fitter place to refresh his Fleet,
none on that Coast abounding more with Limons
and Oranges, which from thence are transported
into <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and if he
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
was better pleased there than he should have
been in fighting, Monsieur <HI>de Vendosme,</HI> he payed
dear enough for it, having been detained priso∣ner
ever since his return from so famous an expe∣dition.
<HI>St. Sebastian</HI> is seated in a very little
Province called <HI>Guipuscoa;</HI> Trafick draws to it
a great concourse, though the Town be but small,
it is very compact, and extremely populous, one
house containing several Families. A Merchant
Stranger is there forced to lodge with some Citi∣zen,
it not being permitted him to be a House∣keeper:
many Dutch men are obliged to live in
this manner. The custom was thus introduced;
strangers at the first settling of Trafick out of
meer liberality gave their Landlords as a Gratuity
one in the hundred of all the Commodities they
sold; and the Inhabitants to preserve this profit
made such an Order, which hath caused some that
would not observe it to be sued at Law. That
which most pleased me in this Town, was, that
the Streets are wide, streight, and very well pa∣ved
with a broad stone, like that of <HI>Florence.</HI> The
principal Revenue of the Country is drawn from
Iron-mills, some of them of a very pure mettal,
and so rich they may furnish all <HI>Europe:</HI> Wools
of old <HI>Castile</HI> are also shipped here, sent in good
quantity by the Merchants of diverse places. The
Baron of <HI>Batteville,</HI> a Gentleman of the <HI>Franch
Contie</HI> (who was then present) is Governor,
and with it of all <HI>Guipuscoa.</HI> Though he hath
rendered very many good services to <HI>Spain,</HI> par∣ticularly
in the Troubles of <HI>Gasconie)</HI> and so sea∣seasoned
himself with Spanish Customs, that he
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
hath forgotten his own Language and Country;
this employment, to which that of Admiral is
joyned, draws on him no little envy. We waited
on him, and he received us well, but returned not
our Visit, and we went away without bidding
him adieu. Here we stayed three dayes, and
kept our Easter: we had been recommended to
a worthy Merchant, who after Dinner carried us
to a Nunnery, where we heard most pitiful Mu∣sick.
This Cloister is on an Eminence, from which
the Town that is overagainst it may be very well
battered; and the Castle or Citadel which is on
the top of a hill, at whose foot the Town stands,
seems rather a Sentry-house to watch, than a For∣tress
to defend it.</P>
<P>On Tuesday in Easter-week, having been
treated by our Merchant, we took the way of
<HI>Madrid,</HI> 84 leagues distant. The Country we
passed through is mountainous and barren, and
we perceived that we traversed the tops of the
<HI>Pirenean,</HI> which almost divide <HI>Spain,</HI> as the <HI>Ape∣nine
Italy.</HI> Necessity quickly taught us the Mode
of the Country, which obliges Travailers to
buy in several places all accommodations neces∣sary.
We tarried a while at <HI>St. Sebastians,</HI> part∣ly
to provide us a <HI>Moco de Mulas,</HI> that is a Ser∣vant
or Guide, to bring us to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to whom
it belongs to buy victual, and carry other provi∣sions:
Forty Crowns were demanded of us for
the attendance of one of those Rascals, which
being so dear, we resolved not to take any, and
to guide our selves as well as we could. The part
of <HI>Moco de Mulas</HI> fell to my share: I shall give
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
you the particulars of this imployment, and of
travailing in <HI>Spain.</HI> At the first arrival at an Inn
you ask for Beds, which being provided, you ei∣ther
give the meat you bring raw with you to the
Host to be dressed, or go your self and buy it in
the Market: if you find any Capon, Pullet, or Par∣tridge
you seek to make sure of them. We were
told we should meet plenty of the last, fatter,
larger, and better than those of <HI>France;</HI> but in
all our Journey we found but one, neither had it
all those advantages. The best way is to carry
your provision along with you in Wallets, and
provide what you find on the place to be made
use of the next day. Coming to your Inn, you
go abroad to buy bread, wine, and eggs; for
something of those is usually to be had, but none
allowed to sell them except such as farm that
Priviledge: Excise goes so high, that the King
hath a <HI>quarto</HI> upon every egge. These Inns are
sad spectacles, and the sight of them gives one a
belly full. The fire is made on a hearth in the
middle of the Kitchin, choked with so thick a
smoke, that you would think your self in the Ken∣nel
of a Fox that the Hunters would drive out▪
a man or woman all in rags like a begger, and no
less lowsie, measures the wine to you, which is
drawn from a Hogs, or Goats skin, in which it is
kept, and which is to it both Barrel and Celler:
the best wine out of these is a very unpleasant
liquor, having a most abominable taste of the
pitched hide. The White-wine is as fiery as <HI>Aqua∣vitae,</HI>
yet bears not water, the least drop being
mixed with it, becoming insipid and without
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
spirit. By what I have said may be gathered how
ill living is in <HI>Spain;</HI> yet I found it not so bad as
I expected, especially in <HI>Biscai,</HI> though a Coun∣try
less fertile then <HI>Castile.</HI> It is true indeed, that
being a Frontier, it is not so much taxed, and the
People enjoy greater liberty, and some provisi∣ons
may be found in the Inns, but at double their
value.</P>
<P>About a day and a halfs Journey from <HI>St. Se∣bastian</HI>
we passed over a pretty high Mountain
called <HI>St. Adrians;</HI> it is none of the steepest or
craggiest, but that which I found most remarka∣ble,
is that on the top of it runs a ridge of rock,
which hinders passing; one would think it pla∣ced
there by nature, as a fixed and insurmounta∣ble
separation between <HI>Biscai</HI> and old <HI>Castile,</HI> in
such a manner, that they have been fain to open
a way with much difficulty; for the rock is cut
thorough thirty or forty paces: In this there is
one house, which must needs be very well roofed,
having so great a Mass of the quarry to cover it.
Freed from this wonderful passage, we descended
into old <HI>Castile,</HI> something more plain, though not
much more fertil. We found here no less trouble
than on the <HI>Alpes</HI> at the Mountain of St. <HI>Godard,</HI>
night surprising us in the middle of the descent,
and for increase of our misfortune, we could get
no lodging at the next Village: this the more
incommoded us in regard one of our horses had
lost both his shoes before: notwithstanding which
we were forced to seek entertainment in another
miserable Village (to which the Host was our
Guide) which afforded us only bread and wine,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
and two wretched Beds, whose Sheets and Ma∣tresses
could not oblige us to put off our cloths.</P>
<P>We began now to approach the heart of <HI>Spain,</HI>
having entred the old <HI>Castile,</HI> where stands the
City of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> for a long time the Seat of its
Kings, the Country is all sand, and little hillocks
of unfertil earth, often interrupted by Mountains
hooded with rocks, unless in some few places
where small Plains and Valleys appear, that af∣ford
the Inhabitants such provisions as sustain
them. But never did I see any Country less beau∣tified
with Gardens: I know not whether by
reason the soil affords them not, or that the peo∣ple
are not industrious enough to take care of
them.</P>
<P>Coming near <HI>Vittoria,</HI> the first City of <HI>Castile,</HI>
we passed through the fairest and best cultivated
Plain we had till then seen: that little City is seat∣ed
at the end of it, as seemed to us, very plea∣santly:
we rested there half a day, as well to shoe
our horses, as to deliver a letter we had for the
Master of the Custom-house, from whom we
hoped addresses necessary to continue our Jour∣ney
securely. We heard rumours of Theeves, and
beyond <HI>Burgos</HI> a great Robberie had been lately
committed. This Letter was very useful to us,
for till then we had not been any wayes molested
about our horses or baggage, but we were assu∣red,
that had we only passed the Gate without a
Ticket from the Custom-house all had been con∣fiscated.
It fell out very luckily for us to have a
letter to him that is the Kings Farmer, who as
soon as he had received it, visited us, and not only
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
caused a sufficient Passport to be given us,
but made us a Present of Wine, Capons and
Neats-tongues, with which furnishing our Knap∣sacks,
we had recourse to them in case of neces∣sity.
The civility of this <HI>Spaniard</HI> was very plea∣sing
to us, and made us judge this Nation more
generous then the <HI>Italians,</HI> though they be equal∣ly
for their particular interests, and one of them
as little communicable as the other.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>April</HI> we dined at <HI>Pancorbo,</HI> and
lay at <HI>Miranda,</HI> and the next day did the like
at <HI>Barbiesca</HI> and <HI>Monasterio de Rodillas;</HI> the
Third we arried at <HI>Burgos,</HI> the chief City of
<HI>Castile,</HI> and so considerable in both <HI>Castiles,</HI>
that it possesses the first place, though disputed
by <HI>Toledo:</HI> we were not at all troubled with
heat on our way, but not a little that day with
cold; a sharp wind caused a hoar frost, and in
some places Ice: <HI>Burgos</HI> is the coldest City of
<HI>Spain,</HI> being seated at the foot of a high Moun∣tain;
it hath formerly enjoyed a considerable
Trade, which of later days is almost lost; it is
not very great; and the most remarkable things
in it are the Church and Arch-bishops Palace,
admirable Fabricks for <HI>Spain,</HI> where generally
they build ill; in some places because they are
poor, and in others for want of Lime and Stones,
so that in every part, and even in <HI>Madrid</HI> it
self, many houses are made of earth; and the
best Fabricks cimented with Clay instead of
Mortar. Another ornament of <HI>Burgos,</HI> is a
large and very convenient Bridge, passing from
the Suburbs to the City: its inhabitants are
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
thought to speak the best <HI>Castilian;</HI> this Ter∣ritory,
of a certain breeds the best soldiers, and
very few afford the King a greater number; we
received extraordinary civilities from a Merchant,
to whom we were recommended by the Customer
of <HI>Vittoria.</HI> He did not only inquire us out com∣pany
for our journey to <HI>Madrid,</HI> because of the
danger of Thieves; but finding us in a lodging
where we could not be well entertained, after
shewing us the Town, carried us to his House,
where he Treated us at Dinner with a frankness,
much more valuable then his good cheer; it was
served in dish after dish, and began by a slender
potage, with two or three slices of bread in it;
every one of us had an earthen porrenger of
it presented him, but the Saffron and Pepper
gave such a hogo, it could hardly be eaten.
It was on a <HI>Saturday</HI> and according to the custom
of that Countrey to eat on such days, the heads
and intrails of Sheep and Oxen, we had such
meats, so that we fared much better then we
should have done by hunting among the Ta∣verns
and victualing houses to make our own
provision: besides, the gallantry of his manner
of Treating, surprzed us, conducting us with a
great deal of freedom into the chamber where
the Cloth was laid, and his wife lay sick abed of
a Quartane Ague; that day I spurred up my me∣mory
to furnish me with all the Spanish, had
lain dormant there, since I studied it at <HI>Florence,</HI>
and lighting on any expression of civility,
repeated it so often, that it was very evident,
Compliments were scarce with me; <HI>M. P.</HI> spoke
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
now and then a word, and <HI>M. S.</HI> was continu∣ally
silent, so that the burthen of the entertain∣ment
lay all on me, who knew not very well how
to acquit my self, especially, when the wife
began to speak from the bed; I knew not whe∣ther
I was to Treat her with <HI>Vuestra Merced,</HI> or
<HI>Vuestra Sennoria,</HI> which so confounded me, that
often supposing, the first belonged onely to men,
I blushed as if I had committed some hainous
crime, and recalling my self, brought out the
second, due only to persons of eminent Qua∣lity,
for <HI>Vuestra Merced</HI> is of all genders, and
so common, that Grooms and Footmen ho∣nour
one another with it: To bring my self
off, I drank her good health, saying, <HI>Sennora
a la Salud de</HI> XXXX and there was gravell'd,
not knowing which word to chuse, and I think
I made use of both, <HI>que dios le dia prompta gua∣rison,</HI>
I cannot tell whether she understood me,
for I have since been told, the last word is not
Spanish; but this I am sensible of, that I com∣mitted
a great incivility by putting off my Hat,
which is never done there at Table: Having
made better use of our teeth then tongues,
it was at last, time to be gone; the Master of the
house, according to the custom of the Coun∣trey,
leading the way, for as they button con∣trary
to other nations, they are also contrary in
this particular; and they say, that in accompa∣nying
the stranger, the Master of the house goes
first to leave the other in possession. I forgot to
give the woman a parting Compliment. Coming
back to the Inn, where we alighted, we found
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
the widow that kept it, drunk, on which I must
take occasion to say, that I never saw so many
women drunk in <HI>Germany,</HI> as on this side the
<HI>Pireneans;</HI> this was the second that gorged
with wine, which they send for to Taverns,
came to piss before us all in the Stable. Though
we had almost resolved to lie at <HI>Burgos,</HI> as soon
as we had left our Merchant, our minds alter'd,
because we were told that three Leagues from
thence we should find a very good Inn, but our
servants being walked abroad, had like to have
hindred our putting this in execution. One of
them having enter'd a Church with spurs on,
the Gates were shut upon him, till he payed
money exacted as on shipboard, but at last he
freed himself; we presently took horse, and as
soon as out of Town, missed our way; after which,
making use of a Priest we met with for our guide,
we happened to be very ill lodged: the next day
cold and rainy, we dined at <HI>Lerma,</HI> where ha∣ving
lit on a good Inn, we continued till the
morning after; we went to see the Palace of the
Lord of it, next the <HI>Escurial,</HI> esteemed the fai∣rest
in <HI>Spain,</HI> It is a vast Fabrick, but ill con∣triv'd,
without either Garden or Plantation for
Walks: being holiday, the inhabitants were to∣gether,
drinking in a large Hall, into which, as
soon as we enter'd, they very civilly presented
us Wine, and the Corrigidor, or chief Officer of
the place, entertained and shewed us several
rooms of the Palace.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Lerma</HI> the 5th, we arrived at <HI>Ma∣drid</HI>
the 9th. where we were very glad to be, as
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
well to rest our selves as to enjoy a milder Climat,
for in <HI>Castile</HI> we were tormented with continual
cold wind and rain, and a Countrey so Steril,
that we could not but rejoyce to approach one
something less savage. An inexpressible number
of <HI>French</HI> pilgrims pass to and from <HI>St. James</HI> in
<HI>Galicia,</HI> the occasion of the Spaniards calling them
<HI>Gavachos,</HI> this makes evident that <HI>France</HI> abounds
in people, and those very idle, in such a man∣ner
to pester the roads of <HI>Spain.</HI> Ignorance,
poverty and abuse in matters of Religion, cause
this disorder, and that a great many poor pil∣grims
(not entertain'd here as in <HI>Italy,</HI> the
Hospitals affording only house-room) die every
year in <HI>Spain.</HI> The best Town we saw on the way
was <HI>Aranda de Duero,</HI> where we provided our
selves to pass the 7th the Mountain of <HI>Samosierra,</HI>
which separates Old <HI>Castille</HI> from New, in which
<HI>Madrid</HI> stands. These passages are called Ports,
as if there were Rivers to be forded or ferried
over, and at first deceived us with the expecta∣tion
of some rapid and difficult Torrent. This
day we suffered by rain, hail, snow, and wind,
and found not <HI>Spain</HI> hotter then other Coun∣treys,
being almost frozen in so advanced a sea∣son,
and between the two <HI>Castiles.</HI> We were not
free from the Mountains, till within Three or
Four Leagues of <HI>Madrid,</HI> the snowy tops of
which are discerned at it: the Plain in which
it is seated is somewhat uneven, rising and fall∣ing
every halfe quarter of a League: it is not
adorned by any one tree, the Land on that
side by which we went towards it is tilled, yet
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
seems very barren, consisting onely of Sand and
light Earth, unless some few eminences; no wood,
and abundance of stones: the way all along is
good, as is usual where Land is bad; and when
we enquired after it, we were answered with a
Spanish Rhodomontado, that we could not possi∣bly
miss it, because the greatest high-way in the
world. On the side we enter'd it appears not
much, but on that where <HI>Buon retiro</HI> stands,
gives a very agreeable Prospect. It is not walled,
the Streets are large, but foul, and stinking They
which calculate all the ordures cast into them,
say they are daily perfumed by above a hundred
thousand Close-stools; the Pavement is so defe∣ctive,
and the Coaches so ill hung, that to ride
in them over so uneven ground is to be broken
on the Wheel. Houses (as well as all things else)
are very dear here. They build only with brick
and clay, having little lime, and no stone but
what is brought seven leagues from about the Es∣curial.
A House that in another place were very
inconsiderable is sold here for 20 or 25 thousand
crowns. Whoever builds is concluded to have a
Purse very well lined. They which return from
Governments beyond sea, demolish their Houses
and build Palaces, which make appear they have
either been Viceroys of <HI>Naples,</HI> or Governors
of <HI>Flanders</HI> or <HI>Milan.</HI> In this manner this
Town, which is new, and the greatest part very
slightly built, according to the abilities of the In∣habitants,
becomes every day more beautiful, as
the better part of the Kings Revenue, is appro∣priated
to those that have the managing of it.
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
<HI>La Placa Major</HI> is very fair, something more
long than large, the houses on all sides uniform,
and the highest in <HI>Madrid.</HI> They are all en∣compassed
by two or three ranks of Balconies,
which serve to see the Feasts of Bulls, the famous∣est
Ceremonies of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Report speaks this Divertisement to have been
derived from the Moors, and indeed it savours
not a little of their Brutality: It suits so strange∣ly
with the genius of this People, that no Town
is so mean but it hath its peculiar Feasts, and
think a Curse would follow should they omit
solemnise them. The King cannot absent himself
from those of <HI>Madrid</HI> without the murmurs of
the People. His Palace is at one end of the Town,
on an almost indiscernable rising, that side on
which we went to it enjoys the prospect of a
little River, and part of a Valley in which are
some trees: by it he can pass to <HI>la Casa del
Campo,</HI> a wretched House of Pleasure, without
other Ornament than a few Walks in a Wood.</P>
<P>On this Brook, rather than River, <HI>Philip</HI> the
Second built a very great and broad Bridge, some
of its arches not touched by any water: And I
believe it was rather made for a more commodi∣ous
passing the descent of the Valley, than to be
a great Bridge to little or no River. The Kings
House hath nothing magnificent, yet is not so
mean as was reported to us. There is a very fair
Piazza before it, to which it represents no un∣handsome
Frontispice, were the building higher,
and a defective Tower finished. It hath two Qua∣drangles
very large: All Councils meet in the
<PB N="19" REF="14"/>
Palace, and the King by private Galleries can go
to any of the Rooms where they sit. There is a
great Concourse, and no less noise, when any of
them are assembled: But in the Kings Apartment
all is very still, and no body appears till he goes
to Mass, the only time of seeing him: His Hal∣berdiers
are then drawn out on each side the Gal∣lerie,
by which he passes; These are <HI>Germans,
Burgundians,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> about two or three
hundred, wearing all Liveries of yellow trim∣med
with red Velvet. When he comes from his
Apartment the Captain of the Gard goes before
him, and he is followed only by two or three
Persons. Passing between these Halberdiers he
receives such Petitions as are presented him. One
day as he went to Chappel we would have gone
in before, the better to view him, but a Door-keeper
(as formerly happened at <HI>Ratisbone</HI> on
such an occasion) told us, that none were to en∣ter
unless clothed in black. I liked no House in
this Town so well as the Prison, where yet I
would least desire to lodge: It is a massie solid
building, the Windows fortified with great barrs
of Iron, as much for ornament as security: they
are artificially wrought and guilded, so that my
mistake will not seem very strange, who at first
thought it the habitation of some Grandee of
<HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>All agree that no City of <HI>Spain</HI> is so populous
as this, and excepting <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> I never
saw so many Coaches in any; they are drawn by
Mules only, and none but the Kings and the Ma∣sters
of his Horse with more than four: They are
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
no wayes magnificent but in some slight guildings
of the Iron-works, and about the Boots: the
greatest part of them are covered with waxed
cloth. On one side of the Town is the <HI>Prado,</HI> a
large Walk made use of for the <HI>Tour;</HI> near it is a
great Fabrick, but low, called <HI>Buen Retiro.</HI>
The Duke of <HI>Olivares,</HI> during his administration,
spent many Millions on a Structure that is not
very considerable: I saw but part of it, where
a Comedy was preparing with Scenes, that would
amount to a great expence; a <HI>Florentine</HI> was the
Undertaker. For ordinary Comedies here are
two Theaters, where they act every day: The
Players have to themselves not above three half
pence for every person, the Hospital as much,
and as much the Town-house; to set down it
costs seven pence, the whole amounting to fifteen
pence. I can say little to the Lines or Plots, not
being skilful enough in the language to under∣stand
Poetry, nor the figurative fashion of speak∣ing
that belongs to it: but know they play their
parts ill, few or none having either the meen or
genius of true Actors. They present by day-light,
so that their Scenes appear not with ad∣vantage:
Their Clothes are neither rich, nor ap∣propriated
to their Subject; and the Spanish ha∣bit
serves where the Scene is <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI>
The Playes I have seen have but three Acts, called
<HI>Jornadas:</HI> They usually begin by a Prologue in
Musick, but sing so ill, that their harmony re∣sembles
little Childrens whinings: Between the
Acts there is some little Farce, Dance, or Intri∣gue,
the most diverting of the whole Piece: The
<PB N="21" REF="15"/>
people are so taken with them it is hard to get
place, the best being bespoken, and the excessive
idleness of this Country, as that of <HI>England,</HI> is
made evident in that in <HI>Paris</HI> it self, though there
are not Playes every day, there is no such crowd∣ing
to them. Having with some exactness re∣ported
the particularities of such places as we saw,
I will now acquaint you with what I in general
observed of the Spanish humor and Government.
This Nation is thought to be very proud and dis∣dainful,
but is really neither so much as it seems:
its meen doubtlesly is deceitful, and they which
frequent it find not all the vanity imagined, and
may perceive it to be a vice proceeding rather
from erroneous Morals than an insolent temper.
To Hector it both in words and gestures, seems
to them a symtome of a great soul; and visiting
other Countries, little or not at all they discover
not this defect, derived to them from the first
milk they suck, and the first Sun gives them
light.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Spaniards</HI> are so ignorant that they be∣lieve
not there is any other Country than <HI>Spain,</HI>
other City than <HI>Madrid,</HI> or King than their own.
When I speak of ignorant <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I mean
those meer <HI>Castillians</HI> who never having quitted
their Threshold, know not whether <HI>Amsterdam</HI>
be in <HI>Europe,</HI> or the <HI>Indies.</HI> The Nobility and
Grandees go little out of <HI>Madrid,</HI> neither as
Soldiers nor Travailers, unless commanded and
employed. They have no information either by
Gazetts or other news written or printed, and I
never more admired any thing than that this Na∣tion
<PB N="22" REF="16"/>
we esteem so politick, and imperious, Ma∣sters
of the secret of the universal Monarchy, and
capable of imposing fetters on the rest of Chri∣stendom,
hath so very few able heads, amongst
whom it is thought the Earl of <HI>Castriglio,</HI> Vice∣roy
of <HI>Naples</HI> is none of the meanest: <HI>Pignoranda,
Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> and <HI>Don Fernando de Con∣treras</HI>
govern all. The Earl of <HI>Ognate</HI> is a great
head-piece, but the Favourite is jealous of him,
and as much as possible keeps him from affairs.
The Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> appear such only at a
distance: here they seemed to me very little, and
without any other advantages than to put on
their hats, and sit down in the Kings presence;
in other particulars I never observed less inequa∣lity
in the most popular Republick. A Shoe∣maker
when he hath laid aside his Awl and Last,
and hung his Sword and Dagger by his side, will
hardly give the first salute to him he wrought for
in his Shop a moment before. You cannot speak
to one of the most inferior of the rabble without
giving him titles of honor; and they treat one
another with <HI>Senores Cavalleros.</HI> If a Beggar
seeks an Alms, and you refuse him, it must not be
without a Compliment, <HI>Pardone Vuestra merced,
no tengo diveros:</HI> pardon me Sir, I have no money.
No other Prince lives like the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his
employments are continually the same, in such a
manner, that he at all times knows how every
day of his life is to be passed over: You would
think some indispensable Law prohibited his omit∣ting
to do according to custom; so that neither
weeks, months, years, nor hours change any
<PB N="23" REF="16"/>
thing of his manner of living, nor present him
any thing new. As soon as he rises and recollects
what day it is, he knows what businesses he is to
dispatch, or what pleasures to enjoy. He hath cer∣tain
hours for forain and domestick Audiences,
and for signing all that tends to the expedition of
his Affairs, dispos▪d of his Treasure, Meals, and
Devotions. And I have been assured that what∣ever
happens he continues firm in such a manner
of acting. Every Saturday he goes to a Church
at the farther end of the old Pardo called <HI>At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cha,</HI>
where he hath a most particular Devotion to the
Holy Virgin, saying it is from her he hath recei∣ved
so great favours, and admirable assistances in
his greatest extremities. <HI>France</HI> also imputes all
its successes to her mediation, and the advanta∣ges
of these potent Kingdoms, having been so
long diametrically opposite, it seems something
inconsistent, that (little happiness coming to one
without the others misfortune) they can both
boast to have her propitious. Every year at the
self same time he goes to his Houses of pleasure,
and they say nothing but sickness can prevent his
retiring to <HI>Aranjuez, Pardo,</HI> or the <HI>Escurial</HI> in
the Months he had wont to enjoy the Air of the
Country. In a word, they which have spoken to
me of this humor, tell me it is very conformable
to his Meen and Port, and they that are near
him assured me, that when they speak to him he
changes neither look nor posture, but receives,
hears, and answers them with the same counte∣nance,
nothing in all his body being moveable
but his lips and tongue. This gravity, whether
<PB N="24" REF="17"/>
natural or affected, is in this Country so essential
a part of Majesty, that we were told that the
Queen one day, transported at dinner to a more
than ordinary laughter, at the ridiculous postures
and discourses of a Buffoon, was put in mind, that
to do so became not a Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> who
ought to be more serious at which surprised,
being young, and but newly come out of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
she said she could not help it unless that
fellow were taken away, and that they should
not have brought him thither if they would not
have had her laugh at him. Two dayes in the
week he gives publick Audiences, principally to
receive Petitions and Memorials of such as beg
any favour of him. He answers not immediately,
but causes them to be all carried into a certain
place, where they are perused by a Secretary of
State, who distributes them to such of the seve∣ral
Councils, as their contents relate to; after
which he that would be dispatched, must enquire
at the Secretaries Office what answer is returned,
but seldom finds any, especially if the pretence
be arrears or reward; and when he hath lost all
hope of hearing what is become of his Petition,
it is permitted him to present as many more as
he pleases, but to little purpose, for the King sel∣dom
sees any, and all are carried to the Council
that received the first, which having no intention
to satisfie him, returns neither Petition nor An∣swer:
For this reason <HI>Madrid</HI> is ever full of
pretenders, who with the attendance of whole
years, lose their ink and Paper. His Majesty
hath also certain hours in which he signs all ex∣peditions
<PB N="25" REF="17"/>
of State, and of his Treasurie; so that
nothing is done, nor one penny given out without
an Order signed by him, whereas in <HI>France</HI> the
Secretaries of State have the Seal and Signature
of the King in their power, which would give
them oppportunities of doing many things on
their own accompt, should they abuse it. It is true
yet, that neither here nor there the Secretary
signs or presents any thing to be signed, but by
consent of the Favourite or chief Minister: and
<HI>Don Fernando de Contreras,</HI> principal Secretary,
who with <HI>Pigneranda,</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI>
governs all, causes nothing to be signed but what
is approved by the later, and the King intirely
confiding in him, signs all he presents without
reading it: for never any Prince was more easie,
nor put greater confidence in his Ministers:
When delivred from <HI>Olivares,</HI> he was no longer
without a Favourite then till the Queens death,
which happened very sodainly after the disgrace
of that chief Minister: Then he received into his
privacy (as they call it here) the Nephew of the
former, at present the most powerful in this
Court: He is also one of the richest, and posses∣sing
the great wealth he inherited from his Uncle,
contents himself to enjoy his fame, and neglect
his maximes, which would probably be attended
by the publick hatred, his politicks having been
thought very corrupt and biassed. It is believed
this Favourite makes no use of his Masters coffers;
and it is but necessary he spare them, they having
never been so exhausted; for besides the Monthly
Pensions of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and those that
<PB N="26" REF="18"/>
follow him, which are very ill paid, this Court is
obliged to an extraordinary charge in <HI>Catalonia,</HI>
and its forces being very weak there, to treat for
three or four thousand Wallons and <HI>Germans,</HI> of
which the poorest foot Souldier will stand it in six
score crowns. The Marquis <HI>Serra</HI> a noble <HI>Ge∣nouese</HI>
(who on that condition returned to <HI>Bar∣celona)</HI>
is promised a hundred thousand crowns a
month to maintain that Army, and to resist the
<HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet was expected, which
brought but 800 thousand crowns on the Kings
accompt the last year; what it would then bring
was very uncertain, thought it was given out to be
very rich, and that it had aboard it two years Re∣venue.</P>
<P>Before the King went to <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> he assem∣bled
the Estates of both <HI>Castiles,</HI> which consist
of the Deputies of 22 Towns, each Town send∣ing
two. Such Assemblies are called <HI>las Cortes.</HI>
The King made them a Speech, and told them,
that of the ten Millions of Gold, his Kingdoms
yearly supply him with, not above three came in∣to
his Coffers, and necessities of State considered,
it was his pleasure they should consult of wayes
to bring the entire sum into his hands. That to
this purpose every Town and Province should
take care themselves to bring their proportion
into his Exchequer, where he willed them to
suppress many of the Officers that managed his
Revenue, and devoured the greatest part of it:
after this he also demanded some augmentation.
The <HI>Cortes</HI> met, and laboured in this affair, but
it was much feared they would not consent to
<PB N="27" REF="18"/>
such a suppression, which would undo many, and
some of their Relations, for the augmentation,
it was believed they would not think the people
able to pay any more, the miserie and poverty
of the Country considered. In the mean time
this King, (his ten Millions of crowns excepted)
draws little or nothing from the People; and
<HI>Navarre, Arragon,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Valentia,</HI>
(not united to the <HI>Castiles)</HI> are not thought to
bring up above two Millions.</P>
<P>The great expences to which his Warrs oblige
him, are known to all the world, but some near∣er
home consume the best of his Revenue: these
are many Pensions, there being hardly any Gran∣dee
of <HI>Spain,</HI> Duke, Earl, Marquis, or Knight
that hath not something from the Publick: not
in recompence of service in War; but because the
most of them are extremely necessitous, in so
much that I have been assured that many of them
compounding with their Creditors, have assign∣ed
them their Pensions, reserving only some small
sum towards a wretched subsistance. Neither are
any accompted rich (the three Favourites above-mentioned
excepted) but the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> the
Marquis of <HI>Leganes,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Ognate,</HI> and two
or three others whose names I have forgotten;
the rest of the Nobility wanting wherewithal to
supply their ordinary expences. But did the King
allow no Pensions to them, he payes enow to o∣thers
to divert a very considerable part of his In∣com.
His Armies abound with Reformadoes,
who receive pay as if actually in service: it is
true indeed that these are so il paid, that I connot
<PB N="28" REF="19"/>
imagin how they subsist, and I spoke with an <HI>Al∣fieres</HI>
that came from <HI>Portugal,</HI> whose Pension is
twelve crowns a month, that protested he had
not recived six in six year.</P>
<P>The Jesuits have of late been obliged to bring
sixty thousand crowns into the Kings Coffers,
which very much disgusted them, and allayed
their zeal in these quarters for the House of <HI>Au∣stria.</HI>
This Sum was shipped by them on the
Indian Fleet, without registring it, and upon dis∣covery
confiscated according to the Law. The
Jesuit to whose care it was entrusted, playd his
part so well that the Kings Officers could not
find it, but that which belonged to other Cloy∣sters,
being seised, they peached, and it became
the Kings, notwithstanding the good Fathers al∣leged
it designed to build a Church in <HI>Navarre,</HI>
in the Town where the Saint the Founder of
their Order was born.</P>
<P>This King spends nothing either in Buildings
or Gardens. Much of ornament might be added
to his Palace, and its height require a Wall in
form of a Terrass, to support its declining, that
increases daily. A Wood below it, that serves
only for a Shelter to Rabbits, and a Nest for
Crows, brought by <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th out of the <HI>Low
Countries,</HI> might be converted into a fair Garden.
The river that passes by it is called <HI>Maucanarzes,</HI>
not so broad as its name is long; its Channel is
gravelly, and it self in Summer so low, that in
<HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> Coaches at the <HI>Tour</HI> go through
it. The Bridge, or rather Causey, by which it is
passed, is both long and large, and cost I know
<PB N="29" REF="19"/>
not how many thousand Ducats; and he was no
fool, that being told that <HI>Philip</HI> the Second be∣stowed
so much cost on so poor a River, said it
was fit either to sell the Bridge or buy Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>Gentlemen here contrary to the customs of
<HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> live in Cities; few
of them having any priviledges for Hunting or
Hawking, neither Mannors or Vassals as with
us, where they are most of them Lords of the
Parishes they dwell in: and indeed the quality
of a private Gentleman is here scarcely intelligi∣ble,
the people having respect only for Orders of
Knighthood, and such as are Titulados, which
comprehends Dukes, Marquisses, and Earls. Here
are yet some Families whom they call <HI>Solari∣egas</HI>
or <HI>de Solar Conocido,</HI> who alone are true
Gentlemen, and can derive pedigrees, of which
they may have testimonies, called <HI>Cartas Execu∣torias,</HI>
and on accompt of them, enjoy some in∣considerable
priviledges. The most antient of
their Titles, was that of <HI>Riccos Hombres,</HI> very
different from <HI>Hombre Ricco,</HI> which last implies
no more but a rich man, but the othet antiently
were the great Lords of <HI>Spain,</HI> before Dukes,
Marquisses and Earls were heard of: They were
covered in those days in presence of their King,
and alone had deliberative voices in Assem∣blies.</P>
<P>Neither Governments, nor Military, nor Civil
Charges are here sold, which is not altogether so
commendable as it seems at first sight; for un∣unworthy
persons (if well looked on by Favo∣rites)
<PB N="30" REF="20"/>
may more easily attain them then if they
paid for them, and several of antient extraction
and great abilities are willing to lay out their
money to put themselves in a condition to serve
their King with honour: neither in Countreys
where Charges are most vendible, are they so to
all Chapmen; but to Gentlemen only, and such
as are qualified for them.</P>
<P>All the while <HI>Olivares</HI> was in favour, he caus∣ed
an ill understanding between the King and his
wife, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>Bourbon.</HI> In order to which
(as some report) he sought to corrupt his
Master with an abominable opinion of certain
graceless People who in <HI>Madrid</HI> joyned toge∣ther
in a Sect, and called themselves <HI>Alum∣brad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI>
as much as to say illuminated, or (if you
please) Phanaticks; these seeking to counte∣nance
themselves in their villanies, that they
might commit them with the greater liberty, held
it out as a Maxim, that part of the Gospel was
mis-understood, and that it was an error to
believe Copulation with a woman (on what
account soever) could render a man blameable
before God.</P>
<P>This King is supposed to have had natu∣ral
issue by several, but none is owned but
<HI>Don John of Austria,</HI> whose Mother was a <HI>Come∣dian.</HI>
Of legitimate Children none grew up but
the Prince and the Infanta, the rest dying very
young. The Prince seemed couragious, but, as
was conjectured, of a nature violent and cruel.
Some report he was taken from so many King∣doms
(as whose sole Heir he was considered)
<PB N="31" REF="20"/>
by an accidental connivence of <HI>Don Pedro de Ar∣ragon</HI>
first Gentleman of his Chamber, who one
night giving way to his lying with a Curtezan, he
so overheat himself that next morning he fell into
a violent Feavour; and the Physitians ignorant of
what had passed, by letting him blood so ex∣tremely
exhausted his Spirits, whose dimunition
was the only cause of his Disease, that they ha∣stened
his death. <HI>Don Pedro</HI> either for not pre∣venting
or not discovering this to the Physitians,
continues in disgrace, and though Brother of
the Favorite, may not yet return to Court: Per∣mission
only being given him to dwel at one end
of the Town, where he neither receives nor re∣turns
Visits with any Splendor.</P>
<P>The fall of <HI>Olivares</HI> hath been very publick in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and made appear that Favour, which
hath no other foundation than the Princes affecti∣on,
nor supports it self otherwise than by the dex∣terity
of him that possesses it, cannot be so dura∣ble,
as his that established on the Basis of his good
service, renders him necessary to whom he is
agreeable, and it is reported that this man did
sometimes buoy himself up in the Kings good af∣fection
and opinion, by the very same inconside∣rable
Artifices, that at last sunk him. Amongst
other inventions this is discoursed; Complaint
having been made that Bread was very dear,
and so scarce it could hardly be had in <HI>Madrid,</HI>
because he had taken money of all the Neighbou∣ring
Villages, to exempt them from an Obliga∣tion
lay upon them, to bring a certain quanti∣ty
every day to Market, he gave Order that all
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
that was in the Town dispersed among several
Bakers, should be brought and exposed in the
street, by which the King was to pass to our La∣dy
of <HI>Atocha.</HI> They to whom he gave this com∣mand
performed it so well, that the Shops and
Stals were loden. The King at sight of such plen∣ty
said he perceived that they which had told
him of scarsitie of Bread were impostors and ly∣ers:
For better Confirmation the <HI>Conde</HI> Duke
Ordered they should bring every day into the
publick Market place all the Bread, they were ob∣liged
to, notwithstanding the Exemptions, upon
which the complaints ceased, and the King a
long time believed that what had been told him
was an effect of the Malice, of such as emula∣ted
and envied his Favourite: But the Queen by
her Wisdom and Patience, at last ruined him,
and by degrees entred on part of the Govern∣ment,
from which his Ambition and Jealousie
had so long excluded her. As soon as she had
gotten credit with the King her Husband, she
made him understand the disorder of affairs, and
danger of the Crown by his Favorites ill conduct:
and this with so much Prudence that he was bani∣shed
the Court; and at last preparations made to
bring him to this trial. The Queens chief Coun∣cellour
on this Extraordinary occasion, was the
Earl of <HI>Castriglio,</HI> a very near Kinsman of him
she designed against. They could not without
great difficulty bring the King to condescend, but
at last the Inquisition concerning it self, and
charging him with that accurs'd Doctrine of the
<HI>Alumbrados,</HI> and an endeavour to Corrupt the
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>
King with it, he was very neer being abandon∣ed
to it, but this was prevented by his death,
suspected to have been hastened by poison, and
that good turn done him by his relations, that
they might the sooner possess his wealth. <HI>Don
Lewis de Haro</HI> inherited the best part of it, and to
so great a value that I was told, by one that had
it from his own mouth, his yearly Revenue a∣mounts
to 130 thousand Crowns: it is not there∣fore
to be wondered if he contents himself with
the quality of Favorite, or Chief Minister, with∣out
a greedy hunting after all advantages he
might acquire by it: but though by this he
exempt himself from the clamors raised against
his Uncle; he is yet supported by very few crea∣tures,
not endeavouring to make any, accord∣ing
to the Pasquil, comparing him with his
Predecessor. Two persons have ruined <HI>Spain,</HI>
one by doing ill to all, the other by doing good
to none.</P>
<P>Before he came into favour, he was in the
Coach with <HI>Villa Medina,</HI> when he was poni∣arded.
This Gentleman was the gallantest Cour∣tier,
and greatest wit of <HI>Spain:</HI> the Curious
relate many of his Reparties, of which this is
none of the worst; coming into a Church, a
Bason was presented him, the usual receptacle
of Money to redeem souls from Purgatory; and
he (demanding what sum served to deliver one,
and being answered, what he pleased) put in
two pistols; withal, desiring to know if the soul
were free, which the other assuring him, he
took again his two pistols, telling him he had
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>
done enough; the soul being in no danger of
returning. Of all his Gallantries, none cost him
dearer then that of a Mask: he was in love
with the Queen, which he mannaged with so
little caution; it occasioned him to be censured
rash and indiscreet; the goodness of this Prin∣cess
inclining her to favour men of parts, caus∣ed
her (altogether ignorant of his folly) to look
well on him. This hastened his fall, for besides
that he could not forbear to mention his Mi∣stress,
which terms better becomming a gallant
then subject, he appeared in a Mask, in a Suit
embroidered with pieces of Eight, with this word
<HI>Mis amores son reales.</HI> This, though equivocal,
gave occasion of discourse to all the world, be∣cause
it was very evident, that he rather de∣signed
the eminent object of his love, then
the avarice of which he accused himself. The
violence of his passion, made him provide a Co∣medy
with Scenes, in which he spent 20 thou∣sand
Crowns, which (to gain an opportunity
of embracing the Queen, whilst he carried her
out of the danger) he set on fire, and with
them burnt almost all the house. Subjects that
incite their Masters jealousie, stand on precipices.
This man was stabbed in his Coach at noon-day:
when accompanied by <HI>Don Lewis de Haro.</HI></P>
<P>One may very reasonably inquire the occa∣sions
of the great expences of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
how they undo themselves, little of pomp or
luxury appearing amongst them, and few of
them going into the wars. They which are
well acquainted with <HI>Madrid,</HI> assure, that most
<PB N="35" REF="22"/>
Families are ruined by Women: every man keeps
a Mistress, or is besotted on a Curtisan; who
(none in the world being more witty, impu∣dent,
or better skilled in that accursed mistery;)
as soon as they ensnare any, plume them to the
quick; they must have Robes of 30 pistols
price, which they call <HI>Gardepies,</HI> other accou∣trements
answerable, Jewels, Housholdstuff,
and Coaches. To deny any thing to that Sex,
is accounted dishonourable. I was assured that
the Admiral of <HI>Castile</HI> (none of the richest)
gave at once to one of these Cattle, Fourscore
thousand Crowns. One of the <HI>Palavicini</HI> of
<HI>Genoua,</HI> told me, that not long before, an inclina∣tion
cost him Two thousand Crowns, and find∣ing
himself delayed by the Baggage to whom he
made his Addresses, he abandoned her, without
obtaining any thing. Here are four Processions
without the Town, whereas at so many So∣lemn
Rendezvouses they endeavour to set out
themselves. All Gallants then present them,
which if any neglect, they are lost, and no more
thought persons of Honour; this makes all with
emulation strive to adorn these infamous Crea∣tures,
and glory not a little in it. No Town in
the World offers so many to publick view ever at
all hours of the day, all Streets and Walks are full
of them; they wear black Vails with which they
hide their faces, but discover one eye. They ac∣cost
all men boldly, being no less impudent, than
dissolute. In <HI>Italy</HI> they are more modest, not
seeking Men as here; and as the disorder is uni∣versal,
so the mischief caused by it is almost in∣fallible,
<PB N="36" REF="23"/>
These Sinners yet enjoy alone all the
liberty of <HI>Madrid,</HI> for Ladies of Quality, and
honest Women, scarce ever go abroad, neither by
Coach, nor otherwayes, to take the Air. Most
of them hear Mass in their own Houses, and ex∣cepting
some few Visits, never appear in Publick,
and then in Sedans. It must needs be granted,
that this Sex hath here a great deal of Wit, ex∣ercising
it self in Reparties; and this with much
liberty, One I have heard of, that seeing on a
Wall the figure of what Women are so careful to
conceal, with this Inscription, <HI>Without bottom;</HI>
with a Coal instantly added, <HI>For want of
line.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is so frequent, as the alterations Love
is pleased to make in the inclinations of those he
inflames, liberal men by them becoming prodi∣gal,
and avaritious liberal; and he whom he in∣spires
not to spend all for the sakes of Ladies, ha∣zards
here to be esteemed a Beast the rest of his
dayes, and persons of a parsimonious humor, and
sordid thrift, how high soever their birth be, shall
be thought base, and the infamy of this defect fol∣low
them to their Graves.</P>
<P>At the Tour, the Curtains of their Coaches
are usually drawn close, and if a man be in their
company, none speak to them, otherwise they
may be discoursed with very freely; They all
paint, and lay on the Ceruse and Vermillion so
grossely, they disgust the Beholders. In short,
they ae generally unhandsom and unwholsom,
and paint as much to hide the symptoms of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocks in their Faces, as to beautifie them. Hus∣bands
<PB N="37" REF="23"/>
that desire to have their Wives live ho∣nestly,
begin so arbitrarily, that they treat them
almost like Servants, lest by a handsom liberty,
they should pass the limits of Chastity, little un∣derstood,
and worse observed by this Sex. In
<HI>Andalusia,</HI> they say, the Husbands are yet more
violent, using them like Children or Slaves. If at
meals they suffer them to approach the Ta∣ble,
it is not to eat, but serve them; with which
if the more Civil dispence, they give them meat
from the Table on the ground, where they sit on
Carpets or Cushions, like <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Taylors;</HI> in
which manner, they also sit in Churches, and in
most Houses, instead of Chairs, you see only a
few Cushions set one on another, by the walls
side.</P>
<P>The Tour of Coaches when in Town, circu∣lates
in the high street, otherwise in the <HI>Prado,</HI>
near <HI>de Retiro,</HI> or by the Rivolet below the Pa∣lace.
The greatest Lords appear with little splen∣dor
above the rest, only their Coaches are drawn
by four Mules, and attended by some few Foot∣men
more than ordinary; the Pages have place
in the Boots of the Coaches. They wear not
Liveries; but most commonly are cloathed in
black; scarce any of them have coloured Lace,
except on the Sleeves: The Kings are still worst
clad, and worst paid. In all Great mens Houses,
they every Night eat up all that remains, and
burn all the Candles, consuming also the Oyle
and Salt, the Servants otherwise taking it as
Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="24"/>
Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> are of two sorts, this Ho∣nour
being sometimes personal, sometimes here∣ditary.
The first, the King bids be covered them∣selves;
the second, themselves and Heirs for
ever. This is all the Ceremony in making a
Grandee, neither do any other priviledges be∣long
to it; so that it is but a Chimerical and Airy
Honour, without any profit; they which marry
the Heiress of a Family of a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI>
that is such hereditarily, become Grandees in
right of their Wives.</P>
<P>This is all I could learn concerning Grandees,
but Spanish Books mention three sorts, one of
which the King commands to be covered before
they speak to him, another after they have spo∣ken,
but before he answers; and the last cover
not, till they have spoken and he answered. When
the King creates a Duke, he is also a Grandee,
and the consequence is good; he is a Duke,
therefore a Grandee; but not he is a Grandee,
therefore a Duke; many Marquesses and Earls
being also Grandees. Their Wives sit in the
Queens presence, and she rises at their coming
in. The King in all Edicts and Letters calls them
Princes: In his Chappel, they have a Seat called
the Grandees Bench, where, without regard to
Antiquity, they sit as they come promiscuously.
The Title of <HI>Sennioria</HI> belongs to them by pa∣tent
of <HI>Philip</HI> the Third. These are, in a man∣ner,
all the advantages they have above other
Gentlemen, who, as well as they, are exempted
from all Taxes, unless when the Publick is in dan∣ger;
at such times, they have been so hea∣vily
<PB N="39" REF="24"/>
burthen'd, that they have paid near half their
Revenue. They are not oblieged to quarter,
unless when the Court goes a Progress; but to
speak in general of the Spanish Nobility, they
have a very considerable priviledge (at least if it
be made good to them) which is, that how great
soever their Debts be, the Revenue only can be
attached, the rest being in <HI>Mayorazgo</HI> (as I un∣derstand
it) entailed, which goes farther; so
that when the Revenue is seized on, the Judges
will appoint the Gentleman, whose Quality ob∣lieges
him to keep Servants, Horses, Coaches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
a Stipend sufficient to support him according to
it; and though he owes as much as a Revenue of
50 thousand Crowns can be worth, and hath but
30, his Creditors can pretend to no more, than
the overplus of what is ordered for his sub∣sistence.</P>
<P>Here are very few Knights of the Golden
Fleece, nor many pretenders to that Honour, be∣cause
difficult to be obtained, and bringing no
profit. It was lately sent to the Archduke <HI>Leo∣pold,</HI>
eldest Son of the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the
Third. The other Orders are <HI>Calatrava,</HI> known
by a Red Rose worn on the Cloak, and <HI>Alcanta∣ra</HI>
by a green one, St. <HI>Jago</HI> wears a Sword gules
or an Arrow, these are near of an equal esteem
and dignity; these Knights have sometimes pro∣fit
by the Commands they now and then obtain
by the Kings favour. A great number of them
were slain before <HI>Lerida,</HI> since which time it is
not believed there are above 1800 in all the
three Orders, whereas before there were above
<PB N="40" REF="25"/>
4000. <HI>Alcantara</HI> is most esteemed, which they
that pretend to, must prove themselves Gentle∣men
of four Descents, two being sufficient to ei∣ther
the other.</P>
<P>In the second Court of the Palace, are Cham∣bers
for several Councils. The Council of State
assembles under the Kings Apartment, where the
welfare of all his Dominions is consulted. There
is also a Council of War, where the wayes of
executing what hath been resolved in the Coun∣cil
of State, are taken into consideration: Near
these is the Council of <HI>Castile,</HI> called <HI>Roial;</HI> it
is very powerful, and consists of Seventeen Coun∣sellors
and a President. Many Affairs of the o∣ther
Councils are referred hither, especially of
the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> in which the people of
both <HI>Castiles</HI> are very much concerned. <HI>Arra∣gon</HI>
hath also its Council, <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI>
theirs. The Council for the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the Kings
Revenue called <HI>de la Hazienda,</HI> sits in another
place; so doth that <HI>de las Ordenes,</HI> which deter∣mines
the differences of the Orders of Knight∣hood,
and Judges of the proofs of Gentry of
such as pretend to them. All these are within the
Palace Walls. That of the Inquisition hath its
Tribunal in the House of the President of that
holy Office: That of the <HI>Cruzada,</HI> which gives
Dispensations to eat Flesh on Saturdayes, and
some other priviledges granted by Popes to the
King, is also held at the Presidents. None of
these pretend to be so absolute, as the Inquisition.
I have been assured, that it is not alwayes in the
Kings power to free those that are accused there:
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
And though this Jurisdiction derives its Authori∣ty
from the Pope, in some Conjunctures it hath
had no regard to his Orders. It extends not on∣ly
to those which in matters of Religion go con∣trary
to the Church, but is a sharp curb to all
whose temper gives jealousie to the State, and dis∣patches
them without noise, as was intended a∣gainst
<HI>Antonio Perez,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Olivares,</HI>
had he not dyed. All resolutions of these several
Councils, pass through that of State, before put
in execution, which examines whether there be
any thing in them, contrary to the general good
of all the members of the Crown.</P>
<P>A Mornings, because then all the Councils as∣semble,
there is a great crowd in the Palace, yet
only below in the two Courts, whither they
which have Business or Suits (as they say here,
<HI>para pretensiones)</HI> come to follow them. Amongst
others, you may see many undertakers of Levies
of Souldiers, solliciting their Disbursments.
When Horse are raised, all the Horses are
brought into the <HI>Piazza</HI> before the Palace,
where one Ear of each of them is cut off. By
this mark they are made known to be the Kings,
and a Trooper selling one of them, or one of
them being sound in the possession of a man that
serves not the King, he may be seized, and carri∣ed
away without any formality of Law; but the
Troopers sometimes cut off the other Ear, and
then presenting the Captain some Dollars, ob∣lieged
him to depose before the Commissary, that
the Horse is dead, after which he is sold without
difficulty. This is one of the greatest profits of
<PB N="42" REF="26"/>
Captains of Horse in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> as they which
have served there informed me.</P>
<P>It is not only very difficult to raise men for
<HI>Catalonia,</HI> but to maintain them, when brought
thither: enduring much hardness, they quickly
die, <HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> especially; <HI>Castili∣ans</HI>
and <HI>Neopolitans</HI> disband and run away, the
latter getting into <HI>France,</HI> present themselves
there to the General, who usually gives them a
piece of money to bear their charges to their
Country, the other coasting to the <HI>Pireneans</HI> on
the side of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> return into <HI>Castile</HI> by
<HI>Navarre</HI> or <HI>Biscai.</HI> Old Soldiers, of what Na∣tion
soever, know the Country, and will certain∣ly
escape, young ones, besides that they are of
little use, last not, as being unaccustomed to so
great fatigue.</P>
<P>The War here is more troublesome to the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> than any where else, and more
important, being in a part of his Dominion, of
which he is very jealous, and where he would
redeem any loss by twice the value in <HI>Italy</HI> or
<HI>Flanders.</HI> They which penetrate into the se∣crets
of this Court, assure that it hath a kind of
contempt for losses in other places, but those in
<HI>Catalonia</HI> touch to the quick, and are as so many
wounds the State seems to receive in its heart,
by which it appears, that they which have con∣cluded
the certain way of shaking the Spanish
Monarchy, to be by making war upon it in its
own Countrey, have doubtlesly very well disco∣vered
where it is weakest.</P>
<P>To defend it self, it must be at a vast expence,
<PB N="43" REF="26"/>
for very small forces, because in great want, not
only of Victual and Amunition, but much more
of men In this it is become defective but in this
last age; for by what <HI>Cicero</HI> said of it, we find
it otherwise in time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who giving
the epethite of couragious to <HI>England,</HI> gave that
of populous to <HI>Spain,</HI> reserving to themselves
that of Piety only. This alteration is easily un∣derstood
by those that consider, how the falling
of the <HI>Gothes</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> into this Country,
with the irruption of the <HI>Moors,</HI> that immedi∣ately
followed it, scattered the greatest part of
the Inhabitants: and when these strangers had
so well settled themselves, that the Cities again
abounded with people, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI>
that conquered all <HI>Spain,</HI> destroyed a great ma∣ny,
and exiled more.</P>
<P>The discovery of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> that hap∣pened
soon after, drew away great Colonies,
and peopled the new World with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
as well by the great concourse of such as (finding
it a better Country than that they abandoned)
seated themselves there, as by a necessity of fur∣nishing
Navies, and transporting Soldiers to form
an Army, and Garrison Forts and Cities; and
this in such manner, that the best of <HI>Spain</HI> is
now in the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Kings wants having ob∣liged
him to sell his Subjects for gold, though
neither the Mines of <HI>Potosi,</HI> nor all <HI>Peru,</HI> are a∣ble
to supply the expence he is fain to be at for
want of men; neither do the Gallions ever bring
wealth enough to discharge the States debts;
for besides that the greatest part of it belongs to
<PB N="44" REF="27"/>
particular persons of <HI>Flanders, Holland, Genoua,</HI>
and <HI>France,</HI> that which comes on the Kings ac∣count
is due to several that have assignations up∣on
it: So that <HI>Spain</HI> is no more than the chan∣nel
by which the Gold of the <HI>Indies</HI> passes to
discharge it self in the vast Ocean of other Coun∣tries:
and therefore in that similitude, where
the world is compared to a living body, <HI>Spain</HI>
is the mouth, which receives, chaws, and pre∣pares
the nourishment, but immediately con∣veys
it to other parts, retaining nothing to it
self but the savour alone, or the little that acci∣dentally
sticks between the teeth. And he had
reason, that considering <HI>Spain,</HI> where little Gold
appears, all other Nations abounding with her
Pistols, said she serves them as the <HI>Damnati ad
Metalla</HI> did the ancient Emperors; or else that
she is like the Ass of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> that laden with
Gold, fed on thistles. But that which com∣pleated
her desolation, was the general expul∣sion
of the Moors. There were many
reasons for the quitting her self of so cursed a
Generation, and impoisoning the waters thereby
to destroy all the Christians, having been impu∣ted
to them, and their continual corresponden∣cies
with the <HI>Africans, Turks,</HI> and other Ene∣mies
of the Kingdom discovered, <HI>Philip</HI> the
third possibly could not have taken a better re∣solution,
than at once to free himself from the
continual apprehension of them: Though it may
well be objected, that a good Polititian ought
as little as may be to make use of such universal
punishments, by which a State is more enfeebled,
<PB N="45" REF="27"/>
than amended; and that when with the dagger
at the brest, we go about to free our selves from
some ill we apprehend, we act rather as desperate
then as couragious and prudent: that it is igno∣rance
of lenitives that forces so soon to cut and
cauterise: That it is a greater vertue to instruct
the vicious, and convert them, then to drive
them from their homes, and shut the doors a∣gainst
them: In a word, that we may oppose er∣rors
without destroying persons. It is very cer∣tain
that this Edict cost the King of <HI>Spain</HI> a great
many rich and good Subjects, of no turbulent
principles, and that with time might have been
made sensible of the truth, and profession of
Christianity. But they were altogether deprived
of the means of it; for if they embraced Christi∣anity,
dssimulation was objected against them;
and that it was only to avoid the rigour of the
Edict. This gave opportunity to the avarice of
those that executed it to play its game, passing
by without molestation such as bribed them,
and suffering them to continue quiet in their
houses.</P>
<P>What discourses soever are made on this ex∣traordinary
rigour, which some have admired
as a policy very high and generous, and others
blamed as a most unnatural cruelty, it having
deprived a King of his Subjects, and almost a
Nation of its native Country: It is very certain,
that since that time <HI>Spain</HI> hath been a desert,
and could never recover the loss (as is reported)
of some millions of people: But besides this
her voluntary depopulating her self, the Indies
<PB N="46" REF="28"/>
prevailing either on the necessity or inclination of
her Subjects, draw them still away, by frequent
and numerous Colonies, in such manner that it
is believed more people have left <HI>Spain</HI> than at
present remain in it.</P>
<P>After these misfortunes (at first looked on as
incomparable felicities by those which boasted
the possession of the West-Indies, and expulsion
of the Moors) Wars arose, and so violent, that it
is computed, that in twenty years they consu∣med
a million and a half of Inhabitants, and that
the Plague, which often afflicted this Country,
carried away near another million; so that e∣ver
since <HI>Philip</HI> the third, <HI>Spain</HI> hath extremely
wasted both in men and money: this is very
true, and in so extraordinary a manner, that if
its Enemies had understood it, and those that
were left behind had not after their separation
differed amongst themselves, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would
have been altogether unable to have resisted
them.</P>
<P>Besides this great ambiguity of good or evil,
which they which judge according to the event
or their own sense, observe in the discovery of
the Indies, and expulsion of the Moors, another
policy is spoken of, which not directed against
the Kingdom in general, attacques only that
part of it which is most noble and illustrous.
<HI>Philip</HI> the second, styled the <HI>Solomon</HI> of his age,
apprehending that the Grandees and Nobility
might at some time or other make use of their
wealth and power against his authority, or that
of his Successors; and remembring that they had
<PB N="47" REF="28"/>
discovered their turbulent inclinations under
<HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, in such a manner, as had like
to have given him great troubles, thought he
could not better secure himself against such of
them as meant ill, than by the weakness of that
whole body; to which purpose he cast the seeds
of vanity and envy amongst them, increasing
the number of Grandees, Dukes, Marquises, and
Earls. The smoke of this drove from their Fa∣milies
all thoughts of profit, and their honours,
redoubled their expenses, by every ones endea∣vouring
to surpass his Companion.</P>
<P>When he saw them deeply engaged, he gave
way to attacquing their Lands, and deprived
them of the Priviledge of <HI>Mayorasgo,</HI> the most
considerable that belonged to them; and that
they might not have in their hands any places of
strength, or houses to retire to when they had
a mind to be troublesome, he forbad them to
repair their Castles: and such as have travailed
between <HI>Valentia</HI> and <HI>Madrid,</HI> observe many
ancient Castles advantagiously scituated for com∣manding
the Country, that decay and fall to the
ground. Thus by heaping honours on them he
took away their power, and obliged them to a
greater charge; and by sparing them that of
keeping up their Castles, deprived them of the
submission and respect their Tenants formerly
had for them: Since this they have lost daily,
and complain that that Prince did not only clip, but
cut off the wings of their Predecessors, reducing
them to that inconsiderable condition they are
in at present; which, like original sun, so closely
<PB N="48" REF="29"/>
follows, that it destroys such of them as find not
remedy, by obtaining some employment at a
distance from the Court, by means of which the
publick Treasure may pass through their hands.
Then they neglect not to fill their baggs, and in∣rich
themselves and Posterities. It is reported,
that besides those which endeavour to repair
their fortunes in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> by some
employment suitable to their birth, many return
rich from the <HI>Indies.</HI> I speak not of Viceroys,
who are canged every 3 years, and lay up milli∣ons,
it being sufficiently known, that very many
Officers under them make great advantages, and
that in <HI>Madrid</HI> they hide the Treasures they
bring home even from the Sun that gave them
birth, lest their discovery cause an account of
their administration to be demanded, or they
be obliged to lend the King a good part without
any hope of ever being paid: so that they nei∣ther
dare put their mony to use, nor buy land
with it, but choose rather to eat up the main
Stock than to hazard it: Thus by little and little
they consume what they so sodainly amassed, of
which their Family sometimes enjoys nothing
beyond the second generation.</P>
<P>They which are employed in the Kings
Councils or Treasurie, have a certainer and secu∣rer
way of enriching themselves, because seated
at the helm of Government. These men thri∣ving
without any apprehension of being molest∣ed,
and demanding account of others, themseves
not obliged to render it to any; make use with
splendour of what they have acquired, building
<PB N="49" REF="29"/>
palaces of extraordinary expence in a Countrey
where Stone and Mortar are excessive dear.
Their plenty alone is with ostentation, that of
others so reserved, and as it were bashfull, that
it often pretends necessity that it may avoid be∣ing
really reduced to it: and some Dutch Inha∣bitants
in <HI>Madrid</HI> told us, that some few years
before, a Tax had been laid upon them, only
because they were thought to be rich and at
their ease: The manner of doing it seems very
severe. A rich Merchant being sent for to a
Committee of the Council, was told that the
King commanded him to bring three or four
thousand crowns into his Exchequer; if he went
about to excuse himself as unable, or by reason
of mony due to him from the King, it signified
nothing; and he was sent away with notice, that
if he paid it not in three dayes he must go six
leagues from <HI>Madrid</HI> in custody of the Mini∣sters
of Justice on his expence. That time ex∣pired
without paying, he was sent 20 leagues
from the Court. They which paid at first freed
themselves from this charge and trouble; they
that were obstinate against what appeared so
unjust to them, suffered both, and were at last
constrained to pay what had been imposed be∣fore
they were permitted to return to their
houses.</P>
<P>Gown-men and Pen-men are here the richest,
and none spoken of but Councellors, Senators,
and Secretaries, who from very poor beginnings
sodainly become wealthy: They which ma∣nage
the affairs of the <HI>Indies</HI> are thought to sur∣pass
<PB N="50" REF="30"/>
all others: and the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda,</HI>
who served his Master so well in the negotiati∣ons
of <HI>Munster</HI> and the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and is
the Favourites Favourite, chose rather to be
President of the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> than of
that of <HI>Flanders,</HI> which questionless had been
more proper for him than any other.</P>
<P>That Council advantages it self as well by the
employments of which it hath the disposal, as
by all Merchandise that passes to and again:
Amongst which wine makes a very profitable
and speedy return, none but Spanish being suf∣fered
to be transported, which is sold with so
great gain, that that which in <HI>Andalusia,</HI> or o∣ther
part where it grows, costs one crown, is
worth 6 or 7 there.</P>
<P>That this may be continued, planting Vines
is there prohibited on pain of death, though that
soil would as well bear them as any part of
<HI>Spain.</HI> Traffick in general (as I before observed)
is not equal to what it hath been; for which (a∣mongst
many other pretended here) this reason
may be given, that the profit made on occasion
of it by the King and his Ministers hath discou∣raged
Merchants, to the loss of a very great Re∣venue
to the Crown: whatever is shipped for
the <HI>Indies</HI> must be registred, and pay the tenth
penny for fault of which it is confiscated. By
this the wealth of the Fleet is known to a far∣thing,
as well what belongs to the King as to
particular persons. Some years since his Catho∣lick
Majesty (wanting money) laid hands on that
which appertained to Merchants, under the no∣tion
<PB N="51" REF="30"/>
indeed of borrowing, but (besides that such
forced lones suit not well with Merchants affairs)
it was never returned: For which reason many
do not register their Gold and Silver, but chuse
rather to combine with the Captains (though it
cost them more) than to abandon all for fair
words. Before the Fleets arrival at Cadis, <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
or <HI>Holland</HI> Ships meet it either near that
Port, or that of <HI>St. Lucar,</HI> and receive there
from such Captains as they correspond with, that
which is on account of those that send them,
and carry it away before it enters any <HI>Spanish</HI>
Haven; and even the Merchants of <HI>Sevil</HI> and
other <HI>Spanish</HI> Cities send their money into those
Countries, where they may freely dispose of it
without fear to have it seised on. It is said that
the Fleet comes this year more rich than usually;
but that the wealthiest ship is stranded, and un∣certain
whether the silver all saved. But they
which will have nothing lost report that more
Gold and Silver hath been recovered than was
registred, if so the King will have the advantage
of it by confiscation.</P>
<P>If we consider the general Government of
these Kingdoms, it seems to move so steadily,
that it declines not at all from those bold Poli∣ticks
which are never disturbed, and that trample
on the sharpest thorns as resolutely as if they
walked on roses: but going to particulars we
shall discover, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who give much
to appearances and the exterior, use no fewer
meens and grimaces in their publick affairs, then
in their particular comportment.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="31"/>
In the Streets, at the Tour, and in the Thea∣ters,
where many eyes are upon them, they seem
very grave, serious, and reserved: but in pri∣vate,
and to those that are familiarly acquain∣ted
with them, they act in a manner so diffe∣rent,
you would not take them for the same per∣sons,
being as vain, wanton, and humorous as
other Nations.</P>
<P>The Politicks of every Country are of a tem∣per
and genius like that of the people that in∣habit
it; and the <HI>Spanish</HI> considered by an un∣biassed
judgement are so as well as the rest.</P>
<P>At first view they seem firm, constant, re∣solute,
and entirely swayed by reason and judg∣ment;
but coming nearer, and examining them,
piece by piece, we may discover weaknesses we
could not have imagined them capable of. Their
pace is sometimes so unsteady they stumble in
the smoothest way, and sometimes so positive,
on account of Reputation and Interest, they
haz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd all for trifles; but always so flow, that
of a thousand of their Artifices, scarce any one
succeeds: I shall not give such examples as I
might of this truth in times past, particularly,
in the revolutions of <HI>Flanders</HI> under <HI>Philip</HI> the
II. and what happened during the League in
<HI>France</HI> in the same Kings Raign, being provided
of later in the insurrection of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and
revolt of <HI>Portugal,</HI> both foreseen, without ap∣plication
of necessary remedies, not only, be∣cause
of obstinacy, but of irresolution and slow∣ness.
I will mention no more here then what is
disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed of at <HI>Madrid:</HI> opinions very much
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>
differ about Sequestration of the Goods of the
Genoueses, some declaring it to have been ve∣ry
just and prudent; others the contrary: but all
agreeing, that having been so vigorously begun,
it ought to have been continued in the same
manner, and being an affair of reputation and
interest, that so great a Monarch should not
have boggled at going through with it, or an
accommodation appearing necessary, by reason
of the prejudice this Rupture gave to affairs,
they should not have moved so heavily towards
it, because in that interval they suffered for
want of returns from <HI>Genoua,</HI> which during such
a suspension they could not supply with the Mo∣ney
they had seised.</P>
<P>They which negotiated in this Court for that
Republick, endeavoured to make understood
that the Siege of <HI>Arras</HI> failed the year before,
because the Merchants recalled the Bills of Ex∣change
they had drawn on <HI>Antwerp;</HI> but the
Spanish Ministers would not acknowledge this,
though it was evident they began to have some
light of it. In the mean time, punctilios only
span out a year before matters could be accom∣moded,
though the Spaniards were no less de∣sirous
of it then the Genoueses; though these
many demurs had no other end but to save the
Spanish reputation, they failed peradventure of
that effect; what had passed was nullified by the
agreement; what had been seised, released, and
the dispute about <HI>Final,</HI> which had caused it,
referred to arbitration.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="32"/>
They had long been agreed of all that was
substantial; but a punctilio of honour caused
the execution to be delayed, it was this: The
Republick would not set at liberty the prison∣ers
taken before <HI>Finale,</HI> unless the King asked
them to do it, and the King would have them
sent home before he made any proposal: all
being like to break off an expedient, was found
(by means of Marquis <HI>Serra,</HI> brother of
him that commands in <HI>Catalonia)</HI> that the Am∣bassador
should visit the Earl of <HI>Ognate,</HI> and
ask him, if he thought the Republick might
oblige his Majesty by setting the prisoners at
liberty, and the other answering yes, all should
be ended; but they add, that this Earl, who
is both high and crafty, and that at his return
from <HI>Naples</HI> had been the first cause of the mis∣understanding,
soundly ratled the Ambassador:
In this proceeding, appears to me a very great
zeal in the Spanish Ministers, in resenting the
affront done them by the Republick, but it con∣tinued
not, and the honour of it was blemish∣ed
by useless delays, all at last being concluded
on conditions, that might have been obtained
at first.</P>
<P>The good understanding that hath continued se∣veral
years between the French and Genouses,
caused the first of these to offer their assistance
to the other towards righting them against the
Spanish violence; on account of which the
Republick held it self so much obliged to the
French King, that it sent <HI>Lazaro Spinola,</HI> a No∣ble
Citizen, in Quality of Extraordinary Am∣bassador,
<PB N="55" REF="32"/>
to return thanks for the assistance
and protection offered; that difference gave
the Genoueses such distaste of the Spanish Al∣liance,
that it moved them to do this to those
they had formerly looked on as the greatest
enemies of this liberty. If we except such in
<HI>Genoua</HI> as by Alliance and Interest are bound to
the Spanish party, the rest of their inclinations
are very contrary to what they were in their
Fathers days during the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> the
I. of <HI>France,</HI> and the Genoueses have at pre∣sent
no other kindness for the Spaniards, then
a Creditor for a Debtor, out of whose hands
he would fain recover what belongs to him;
after which they would little value them: but
however the Genoueses comport themselves,
their patience will never oblige their debtors
to satisfie them, who think they do enough
when they pay the interest without any longer
considering the principal, which the Spaniards
are well enough content to be thought unable
to discharge, whether it be so to free them∣selves
from being demanded it, or that the ne∣cessity
of their affairs obliges them to it.</P>
<P>This in the mean time is a good caution to
the Genoueses, by little and little to free them∣selves
from the Spanish clutches. All strangers,
what services soever they may have done them,
ought to fear them, they considering themselves
and interests only,, in such manner that the <HI>Ita∣lians</HI>
and <HI>Flemings</HI> that are this Kings subjects,
are used no more favourably then if born un∣der
another Master: If they pretend to imploy∣ments,
<PB N="56" REF="33"/>
either at Court or in the Armies, they
are told they are not natural Spaniards, who
engross all, as well to keep up the glory of the
Nation, as out of diffidence of others, whom
they in a manner declare incapable of all trust
because not born in <HI>Spain:</HI> this Countrey
are nevertheless abounds in strangers, but they
only Artificers and Mercenaries invited by gain,
and that meddle with nothing but their ped∣ling
traffick. It is thought that there are above 40
thousand French in <HI>Madrid,</HI> who wearing the
Spanish habit, and calling themselves <HI>Burgun∣dinians,
Walloons</HI> and <HI>Lorrainers,</HI> keep up Com∣merce
and Manufacture; it concerns them to
conceal their Countrey, for if it be discover∣ed,
they are obliged to pay a daily Pole-money
of about a penny to the Town, and, any bad
success happening to the publick, appearing in
the streets, are liable to a thousand insolencies,
even to blows.</P>
<P>They that know what number of strangers
are in this Town report, that would they
undertake it, they might make themselves ma∣sters,
and drive out the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Such as have business, or intend to stay any
time, habit themselves after the manner of the
Countrey, which we must have done had we
been <HI>para pretensiones</HI> (as they call it;) we must
then have put on the Cassock and all the rest
of the Castilian Harness, none being welcome
to the Court without it: nor can any speak to
the King unless clothed in black, in which they
are so punctual, that an Envoye from the Prince
<PB N="57" REF="33"/>
of <HI>Conde</HI> was fain to wait till he suited himself
in that colour before he could have Audience;
even Women, and of those the loosest, least de∣sirous
to appear such, immediately solicite stran∣gers
to quit the habit of their Countrey, which
causes them to be the more observed when
they make their visits. The Spaniards wear a
Cassock with deep skirts which sits very close to
the body from the neck to the hanches, a black
leather Girdle, which buckles on the Breast,
or toward the Navil; their Breeches are so
streight, that for more easie putting them on
and off, they are buttoned at the sides towards
the bottom; their shooes are shaped exactly to
their feet, with narrow soles; and a little Foot
and large calf of the leg, are in such request,
that Gallants bind their feet about with Riband,
to their no small torment, whilst by quilted
stockins they put themselves perfectly in the
mode: their silk stockins are knit very open,
almost like Net-work, which they stretch very
streight upon white, that is seen through them;
they wear no longer broad brimmed Hats, but
very narrow ones lined with Taffata; they
esteem it very gallant, and of more then ordi∣nary
magnificence, to wear Hatbands of many
broad black Bone-laces, which doubtlesly cost
as much as Plumes, they sending for them to
<HI>France</HI> or <HI>Flanders:</HI> they are not curious in
their Linnen, using little Bonelace on it.</P>
<P>The reason of their beginning to dress them∣selves
from above, and to button from below,
is not to be contrary to other nations in all
<PB N="58" REF="34"/>
they do, but because the Air is so penetrating,
that if they be not very careful to keep their
breasts warm a mornings, they hazard sickness;
many for neglecting this, having suffered ter∣rible
accidents, and lost the use of their Mem∣bers;
this hath also happened to others by lea∣ving
their windows open a nights: Black Bays
and Rattin is their Winters wear; in Summer
they use Taffata Suits, but leave not off the
Baise Cloak and Cassock.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>May</HI> we saw the Tour of Coaches
without the gate of <HI>Toledo,</HI> this is one of the
most celebrated, and at it appear many of all
sorts, some drawn by four Mules, if Dukes or
great Lords, with a Postillion, and the former
Mules fastened by long Harness; such as
have six Mules, you may conclude belong to
persons very eminent, who are not allowed this
Magnificence but without the Town, which
prohibition was occasioned by the Kings being
told that the Tour was little frequented, by rea∣son
of the vanity of such as unable to appear
with six Mules, forbore it, that they might not
seem less then those with whom they pretend
equality.</P>
<P>No Coachman sits before the Coach, but on
one of the foremost Mules; this having been
forbidden by the Conde Duke, who had a se∣cret
revealed by the Coachman: they almost
all use Mules, since the Coach-horses were ei∣ther
effectually taken away, or threatened to
be sent into <HI>Catalonia.</HI> The breed of horses is
by this means so neer lost, that if something be
<PB N="59" REF="34"/>
not done to prevent it, <HI>Spain</HI> will be entirely
disfurnished, the greatest part of Mares being
reserved to bear Mules, the profit of them be∣ing
great by reason of a quick and advanta∣gious
Market. The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath re∣medied
this, by forbidding the use of Mules,
and the Clergy refusing to obey under pre∣tence
of certain priviledges, he gave them ex∣emption,
but on pain of death forbad the Far∣riers
to shooe any Mule, by which means he
easily reduced them to observance of his order.</P>
<P>The glory of this solemnity principally con∣sists
in the bravery of the Ladies, who are ex∣traordinarily
industrious to appear with splen∣dor,
putting on their richest accoutrements,
they forget not Ceruse and Vermillion:
they are seen in divers postures in their ser∣vants
Coaches, some making a half discovery of
themselves, others with open Curtains, expo∣sing
their gallantry and beauty; such whose
servants cannot or will not accommodate them
with Coaches, stand in the streets that pass to
the place where the Tour is made, or at one
end of it.</P>
<P>Part of their liberty, or rather licentiousness
consists in an indifferent demanding of any to
pay for Lemons, Wafers, Sweet-meats or Per∣fumes,
which are carried up and down to be
sold; they give intimation of this by those
that sell them, and it is accounted a great inci∣vility
to refuse, though for six penny worth of
ware one pay a Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="35"/>
Here appear also many fair Horses with rich
Saddles, and their Mains and Tails tied with
Ribbands; the Riders are either such Gallants
as have lent their Coaches to Ladies, or such
others as having no Coaches, are willing on
horseback to enjoy the pleasure of the Tour.
After many circuits, and the view of the seve∣ral
files of Coaches; evening coming on, all
make a stand, and in their Coaches eat such pro∣visions
as they have brought with them. This
custom is not peculiar to this solemnity, but al∣most
every day, especially Sundays, you walk
amongst Bevers and Collations; so much the
Spaniards are pleased to Feast in the field,
though but on an Onion, a Salad, or a few hard
Eggs.</P>
<P>Hither also come some Women of Quality
with their Husbands, and Gallants with their
Mistresses, who being under their eye comport
themselves so modestly, they hardly looke on
any, or return a salute. Ordinary Citizens are
dispersed about the fields, or sit on the River
side, or some corner of the Medow or green
Corn: they feast on very slender provision
with much Majesty and Jollity, accompanied
by some friend, or their Wives and Families. I
have been assured, that besides these slight de∣bauches,
the Spaniards in their houses seldom or
never Treat one another: and they which have
been at their Feasts add, that the dishes, assoon
as set on the Table, vanish, each guest seising
one with this word <HI>Con licentia,</HI> to send it to his
Mistriss, in such manner that the company is
<PB N="61" REF="35"/>
sometimes without any meat, and almost ever
without so much as tasting the best.</P>
<P>At this time the King is usually at <HI>Aranjuez,</HI>
from whence he often comes to view the Tour,
and having ridden about, returns without en∣tring
the Town, which at first seemed to me
but a poor diversion, it being Seven long
Leagues from <HI>Aranjuez</HI> to <HI>Madrid;</HI> but con∣sidering
how swiftly he passes them, with Six
Mules, ever driven at their best speed, and
changed at half way, I could neither think it
tedious nor inconvenient, the seven Leagues
being dispatched in little more then three hours;
but I could never apprehend what pleasure he
can take at the Tour, since as he passes by, all
Curtains out of respect, are drawn, so that he
sees nothing but the Coaches, though the de∣sign
of it is only to appear with splendor, and
enjoy the view of all that is gallant: Respect
here questionless destroys the pleasure it aug∣ments
in other Countreys, where at the Prin∣ces
approach, all make a stand, and Women un∣mask,</P>
<P>The 5th of <HI>May</HI> we went to <HI>Aranjuez</HI> to
see the Court; this pleasant seat where the
King every Spring resides a moneth, is cer∣tainly
very agreeable, and the Spaniards that see
nothing equal to it, mention it no otherwise
then as the <HI>Elisian fields:</HI> their Poets call it the
Metropolis of <HI>Floras</HI> Kingdom, and her Trea∣sury;
in the way to it we passed the River
<HI>Tagus</HI> by a wooden Bridge, which hath a Gate
at one end of it, that is shut when the Court
<PB N="62" REF="36"/>
is not there, then people Ferry over, paying
some Duties, which are part of the Rents of
<HI>Aranjuez.</HI> The first thing presents it self is a
Park with Earthen walls, called <HI>Tapia,</HI> it is
large, and beautified by divers Allies; in the
Heath on each side the passage to it, are Cony-Warrens:
by the Park side is a very large
Walk, from which several others like it; ex∣tend
to the right and left, it leads to a Gate
at the end of a bridge over a Canal, drawn
thither from the River; this forms an Island
in which the Garden is, very fair and neatly
kept, its entrance is from the Palace, and as soon
as the Bridge is passed, two Statues of Brass
appear, from the cut off Arms of one of which,
water distils; hard by these is the Cistern of
the Fountain of <HI>Diana,</HI> which stands in the
middle of a Mount raised of Stone, Wood,
Moss and Earth; many Figures of several Crea∣tures
are joyned to it, who pleasantly spout out
water as they receive it by Pipes from the River;
in all this Garden I saw not any Fountain that
derives its stream from a Spring; round about
the Cistern stand Eight Ships (if I mistake not)
of Mirtle, whose Branches are so accommoda∣ted,
that the poops, prows, and all the rest of
the hulks are well shaped; on each of these is
a little Statue that spouts water against the
Beasts that are on the top of the Mount. We
came next to the Fountain of <HI>Ganimed,</HI> who
is mounted on an Eagle at the top of a Pillar;
at the Cistern side stand <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Hercules;</HI> a
little from it is the Fountain of the <HI>Gelosia,</HI> or
<PB N="63" REF="36"/>
small Lattice, so called, because at the top of it,
the water represents the form of one of those
Lattices or Gelosias that are usually set before
windows: neer it is another, called the Gold∣en
Rowel; and at the entrance of the middle
Ally, that of the Harpies, the fairest of all; its
Cistern is square, and at the four corners on
four Pillars, stand those monstrous Creatures,
vomiting water against the statue of a man,
that sitting on one of the middle Columns, seeks
a thorn in the sole of his foot: in the same
Ally not far from the end of the Garden is the
Fountain of Don <HI>John of Austria,</HI> whose Sta∣tue
is placed on the top of it, water distilling
from his hair; it is made of a stone that was
found in a Turkish ship after the battle of <HI>Le∣panto,</HI>
it hath two Cisterns, and below four
<HI>Cupids</HI> with several Emblems: this Garden is
very pleasant, as well in it self, as by reason of
its particular ornaments which are not yet equal∣ly
taking; the Walks are almost all too narrow,
and one would think they had been niggards
of ground for the parterres; the Arbors are
low, and upheld only with Laths instead of
Deal spars, which would not have been spared
by a rich private person; round about the Isle
by the River and Canals side is a large Walk,
well kept and swept, shaded by tall Elms;
this is the fairest, and in which their Majesties
most delight, in it is one Arbor, looking into
the highway of <HI>Madrid,</HI> in which the Queen
was the day the Bulls were fought, to see them
pass by, after the King and his Court had
<PB N="64" REF="37"/>
brought them from the Heard from which they
had separated them: the day of this sport is
made a great secret, the King never declaring
it till the night before he sends away the <HI>Her∣radores,</HI>
or markers of the Bulls, then also giving
notice to the countrey people to bring them in:
we had the first news of it in the great walk, of
which I will speak anon, where we met the Queen
going to take the Air; as soon as her Coach and
that of her Maids of Honour were passed by, a
man on horseback, said to be the Guardian or o∣verseer
of that Sex, taking us for Dutchmen, cal∣ling
to us told us, that one of those Ladys or Maids
of Honour had a Cousen married in the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI>
and would be glad to enquire of him,
we turned back and after some short discourse,
she acquainted us, that possibly the sight of
Bulls might be the next day, not daring posi∣tively
to declare it: this caution is to prevent
too great a concourse: immediately the Ladies
Guardian interrupted our small entertainment,
bidding us go off from the Coach, having talk∣ed
long enough with the Ladies▪ we returned,
admiring no less his incivility, then the imperti∣nence
of the Queens Buffoon, presenting one of
us a pipe of Tinn to speak to him with, be∣cause
deaf as he feigned; this great Walk is
beyond the Village of <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> so wretched,
it scarcely affords any lodging, so that at our
arrival there we were fain to go farther, and
though the Moon shone, and we had guides,
lost our way; in the place where we stayed
we had much ado to get Stable-room for our
<PB N="65" REF="37"/>
Horses, and shelter for our selves, and were
very well contented to sleep on Chairs and
Benches. This is not occasion'd by reason of
a great Court, for almost all the Officers are
lodged in the Kings house, though very small;
but the Village affords but one Inn, which was
taken up by the Emperours Ambassadors, so
that we could have no place there till next
morning. That day we resolved to make an
end of seeing <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> and when we had
been where the Camels are kept, where there
was only one Female, and a young one, the
rest being abroad to carry wood, as we return∣ed
by several f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Allies, our guide told us, that
after a birth the Females are two years before
they again bring forth: He said also, that they
sometimes bait them with Dogs, and that it is
very pleasant to see how dexterously those ill
shaped creatures defend themselves against Ma∣stiffs;
and that their fury sometimes break
through the Rails and discharges it self on the
Spectatators: coming near our lodging, he
mentioned a rare Waterwork with so many cir∣cumstances,
that he incited our curiosity to go
and see it, by we discovered his simplicity, it
being nothing but a Mill to saw boards. This
confirmed our opinion that what is very com∣mon
in other places, passes often here for mi∣raculous:
in the afternoon we went to see the
great and magnificent Walk at the end of the
Village, neer the way to <HI>Alcala de Henares:</HI>
on each side it is a double row of fair young
Elms, towards whose better growth, they can
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
at pleasure let in water between the ranks: it
is very long and large, and in two or three
places are wide circles where Coaches may
wheel about as at our Tour in <HI>Hidepark:</HI> at the
end of it is a bridge over <HI>Tagus</HI> with a door, in
such manner, that the King when at <HI>Aran∣juez,</HI>
either without Guards, or only with 10
or 12 Halberdiers, is as within an entrench∣ment,
not to be passed but by these bridges;
on the right hand is another Walk leading to
a Grange where three Asses are kept to cover
Mares for production of good Mules; in my
life I never saw any so big, the youngest being
as high as any Mule, the two other not much
lower; the First cost Two and twenty thou∣sand
Reals, which amounts to <HI>600 l. sterling;</HI>
they are exempted from Duty but two days
in the year, that is, on <HI>Corpus Christi,</HI> and the
<HI>Feast of the Ascension;</HI> at other times, as we
were told, the Male Caresses the Female twice
a day, by this appears that most of the Mares be∣ing
made use of to bear Mules, the breed of
Horses will by degrees be lost here, and they
would have much ado to raise Cavalry, were
there occasion for it. Rumours have been spred
that Mules should be prohibited, but this was
found difficult; I know not whether by means
of the Clergy, if so, it had been easie to have
applied the remedy made use of by the King
of <HI>Portugal;</HI> Though above the folly of those
Travailers, that mind no more of the Courts of
the Countreys they pass thorow, then to see
the Princes Diss or Ride. Our little stay in
<PB N="67" REF="38"/>
<HI>Spain,</HI> and difficult access to the Court, by rea∣son
of its great privacy, obliged us to amuse
our selves with what takes the eyes, but little
satisfies the intellect. On <HI>Ascention day</HI> by means
of Sir <HI>Benjamin Wright,</HI> we were permitted to
stand in a corner of the chamber where the
Queen dined; she is of a middle stature, ra∣ther
inclining to be low; over against her stands
a Lady that presents the dishes, and doth the
Office of Carver; on each side of her stands
another; she on the right, presents the
Glass, she on the left, the Napkin; she drinks
very little, but eats well; she was served with
many dishes, but as we thought, few good ones;
she hath a Buffoon that talks continually to en∣deavour
to divert her; four or five youths of
the best families in <HI>Spain</HI> bring in the meat out
of the next chamber, these are called <HI>Meni∣nos,</HI>
all habited in Gray, yet with difference
in the Colour: we wondred to see the Spanish
gravity suffer such neglect of Majesty; these
<HI>Meninos</HI> using very little respect in the Queens
presence, they often prated and shared a dish
of Apples with the Buffoon, and some of them
at the door pushing one another, made a great
noise, without any reprehending them; none
are admitted to see the Infanta dine, and up∣on
our expressing a curiosity for it, it was ru∣moured
that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was <HI>incognito</HI>
at <HI>Aranjuez:</HI> an honest Spaniard after the fight
of Bulls, brought me into a Garden where I
saw her take Coach: she is low, of a sprightly
meen and quick eye, her face rather long
<PB N="68" REF="39"/>
then round. It is pity the custom of the Coun∣trey
obliges her to paint, for with less red she
would certainly appear more lovely, though
the Queen and she seem less inflamed then the
rest of the Court, whose cheeks are Scarlet, and
that so grosly laid on, it seems rather to aim
at disguise then beauty; and indeed the most of
them are so ill favoured, that all the paint in
the world made use of with the greatest Art, can∣not
help them. The Maids of Honour take
the first three or four Coaches: and the Due∣nas:
(who are old Women clothed in white,
and almost covered with Vails) the last; the
Queen and Infanta follow in a Coach with six
Horses, an old Lady sitting in the Boot; their
wide Farthingales extreamly fill the Coach, and
one would take their thick and knotty Elflocks
for Hempen stuffing, broke out of an old pack-saddle.</P>
<P>Their Whisks or rather Cravats are made of
great points, which doubtlesly cost a great
deal, though unhandsome: almost all of them
have Looking-glasses, Watches or Pictures
hanging at their Girdles; I saw none Court them
but the Marquis of <HI>Aytona,</HI> who walked by a
Coach side talking with one that sate in the
boot; but I was told this is done with freedom
enough in the Queens withdrawing room; and
whensoever they appear at windows by signs
agreed on between them and their servants in
order to so gallant a conversation. When
they marry, the Queen adds Fifty thousand
Crowns to their portions, which are very will
<PB N="69" REF="39"/>
paid; besides these Ladies and some Querries,
the Queen hath no attendance at her going
abroad but her Buffoon, with some mean Offi∣cers
and Footmen: she hath no Guards, and
I admired her being publick with so little state.
The King hath about a dozen Firelocks that wait
daily at his Stair-head; these are either <HI>Fle∣mings</HI>
or <HI>Burgundians,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Arcos</HI> is their
Captain. On the Guard they wear the Kings
Livery (which at other times they lay aside)
and an odd Kind of Sword or Hanger called
<HI>Cuchilla:</HI> They are in all 150. There wait also dai∣ly
sixteen <HI>Spanish,</HI> and as many <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Hal∣bardiers.
This Guard was first introduced in <HI>Spain</HI>
by the House of <HI>Austria:</HI> and we were told there
are besides these two old Companies of <HI>Spaniards</HI>
formerly the Guards of the Kings of <HI>Castile,</HI>
which are but ill payed, and the rest not much
better. The morrow after Ascention day <HI>Dom
Lewis de Haro</HI> arrived, the King having sent
for him to the Solemnity of the <HI>Herradura</HI> or
marking of Bulls: a little after which his Majesty
took horse at the point of the Island of the Gar∣den,
and having commanded the people to go
without the rails, went with all his Court to the
end of a great Alley, to drive the Bulls into that
part of the field that is inclosed: Men on horse∣back
with great cudgels enrage them, whilst o∣thers
behind drive them forward with shouts
and blows. Then comes the King with his Court,
and the sport is at an end.</P>
<P>Their Majesties having heard Mass, the Go∣vernor
of <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> the best Torreador, that
<PB N="70" REF="40"/>
is Champion against Bulls, of all <HI>Spain,</HI> begins
the second hunting of these beasts, to drive them
into the innermost partition, where they are to
be marked with a hot iron: There they remain
till 3. in the afternoon, at which time all Win∣dows
and Scaffolds abounding with Spectators,
their Majesties take their seat, and give order
to begin: within the Barricadoes stand several
young Country fellows (whom they call Her∣radors)
expecting the Bulls to grapple with them,
and two or three being let loose, the bravest
run and seise their horns, or tails, and seconded
by the rest endeavour to cast them on the
ground, whilst others with hot irons mark them
on the thighs, some the mean while slitting
their ears. Much agility is necessary in this acti∣on,
as well in performing it as afterwards, the
Bulls being very furious. To deceive them, the
assailants present each a Cloak or Hat, and the
Beast shutting his eyes when he gores, one of
the boldest leaps upon his neck, and catches
hold of his horns, the rest doing the like to such
other parts as they can light on, but he over∣throws
and hurts many, and it is strange that
he kills not the most, for oftentimes running
right upon them, he casts them down and pas∣ses
over them, but those one would think dead
(I know not how) sodainly rise again. They are
indeed very nimble in avoiding their horns,
and ready in falling to let them go by. This
sport may be very pleasant, but not to the act∣ors,
and I admire so great a King vouchsafes
to look on it, and conceive he does it ra∣ther
<PB N="71" REF="40"/>
out of policy to comply with the custom,
then invited by any delight, he takes in it; but
that something extraordinary might be done
for his diversion; <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> caused his
Fool or Buffoon to enter the Lists, who clad in
all manner of colours, and mounted on a white
Steed, was with it tossed into the Air, and af∣terwards
trampled on the ground: Twenty two
or twenty three of the Bulls were marked, which
will be made use of at the Festivals of <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
amongst which we hope to see that of
<HI>St Isadore,</HI> the Patron of the Town.</P>
<P>A while after we went to the Escurial,
which to give it no less then its due, may in
<HI>Spain</HI> pass for an admirable Structure, but where
building is understood, would not be looked
on as very extraordinary. In a general consi∣deration,
it seems a mass of stone of great per∣fection,
but going to particulars, scarce any of
them but falls very short of the Magnificence
imagined, and that so much, that if <HI>Philip</HI> the
Second who built it, and was called the <HI>Solomon</HI>
of his age, did no more resemble that wise King
then this edifice does his Temple, to which it is
often compared; the copy comes very short of the
Original: in the mean time to stretch the com∣parison
they please themselves in saying, that
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth like another <HI>David</HI> only de∣signed
this Holy work, which (being a
man of war and blood) God reserved for his
Son. Ignorant strangers are entertained with
this tale, but such as are versed in History tell
us, that after the battle of <HI>St Quentin, Philip</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="41"/>
the Second made two vows, one never to go in
person to the wars, the other to build this Cloy∣ster
for the Order of <HI>St Hierom</HI> instead of that
which had been burnt, it cost him neer six Mi∣lions
of Gold, though out of consideration of
parsimony and convenience of bringing stone,
he made choice of the worst scituation in na∣ture,
for it is at the foot of a barren Moun∣tain,
and hard by a wretched Village called
<HI>Escurial,</HI> that can hardly lodge a man of any
fashion; this may seem very strange to those
that know the Court is there twice in a year:
the place it stands on, is by transcendence called
the Seat, because it was levelled in order to
build on.</P>
<P>The Fabrick is very fair, with four Towers
at the four corners, but coming to it, one knows
not which way to enter, for as soon as out of
the great Walk, in a kind of Piazza, you see on∣ly
little doors, which when you are over it,
lead into two Pavilions that contain Offices and
Lodgings for some of the Court; when you
have well viewed this side of the square, you
come to that which is towards the Mountain,
where is a very large Magnificent Portal, on
each side beautify'd with Pillars; by this state∣ly
Gate you enter a Quadrangle, where right
over against it stands the Church, ascended to
it by a Stair of five or six steps, as long as the
Court is large, extending from one side of it to
the other: very fair Columnes support the
Porch, and on the top of the wall stand six
Statues, the middlemost of which are <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="41"/>
and <HI>Solomon,</HI> by whom they would represent
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Philip</HI> the Second. About
the Church are many Pavillions, all compre∣hended
in the exact square which environs that
building. Report mentions many Bascourts, but
we could not reckon above 7 or 8. That this
is a very fair Cloyster for Friers cannot be de∣nied,
neither can it be allowed to be a Pal∣lace
Magnificent enough for such a Monarch as
<HI>Philip</HI> the Second, who having built it in One
and twenty years, and enjoyed it Twelve or
Thirteen, boasted, that from the foot of a
Mountain and his Closet, with two inches of
Paper, he made himself obeyd in the old and
new world.</P>
<P>The King and Queens apartment have no∣thing
in them that appears Roial, they are al∣together
unfurnished, and they say, when the
King goes to any of his houses of pleasure,
they remove all to the very Bedsteds: the rooms
are little and low; the Roofs not beautiful e∣nough
to invite the eyes to look up to them:
its many pictures of excellent Masters, and espe∣cially
of <HI>Titian,</HI> that wrought a great while
there, are very much vanted, yet there are not
so many as report gives out. The Spaniards have
so little understanding of pictures, they are
alike taken with all, and the Marquis <HI>Serra</HI> a Ge∣nouese
that accompanied us sufficiently, laugh∣ed
at the foolishness of a <HI>Castillian,</HI> who wil∣ling
to have us admire the slightest and wretch∣edst
Landskips of a Gallery where we were,
told us nothing could equalize them, because
<PB N="74" REF="42"/>
in a place where their King sometimes walked.
There are yet in the vestry some good pieces,
especially a <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Mary Magdalen;</HI> and
in the Church, others very estimable. For paint∣ings
in <HI>Fresco,</HI> the Quire done by <HI>Titian</HI> is doubt∣lesly
an excellent work, and so is the Library,
I think by the same hand, where amongst the
rest is represented the antient Roman manner
of defending Criminals, who stand by bound
hand and foot; <HI>Cicero</HI> is also there pleading for
<HI>Milo,</HI> or some other, I not being sufficiently ac∣quainted
with his meen, to be positive and with∣out
apprehension of mistaking: this Library is
truly very considerable, as well for its length,
breadth, height and light; the Pictures and Mar∣ble
Tables that stand in the midst of it; as for
its quantity of choice and rare Books, if we may
beleeve the Monks; they are certainly very
well bound and guilded, and if I mistake not,
but seldom read. In the Vestry they shew Priests
Copes, where embroidery and Pearl with emu∣lation
contend, whither Art or Matter renders
them more rich and sumptuous; they shewed
us a Cross of very fair Pearl, Diamonds, and
Emeralds; it is a very pretty knack, and would
not become less such if it changed Countreys;
I would willingly have undertaken for it if they
would have suffered it to pass the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI>
had it been only to shew my friends a hun∣dred
thousand Crowns in a Nutshel. The Libra∣ry
I have spoken of; the high Altar and Mo∣nument
of their Kings, which they call <HI>Pan∣theon</HI>
(though I know not why, unless because
<PB N="75" REF="42"/>
a single round Arch like the Pantheon at <HI>Rome)</HI>
are certainly the best pieces of this Magnificent
Fabrick. The high Altar is approached by steps
of Red Marble, and invironed by Sixteen pil∣lars
of Jasper, which reach the top of the Quire,
and cost only a matter of 50 or 60 thousand
Crowns cutting, between these are Niches with
Statues of guilded Brass, and so there are on
the side of the Tables, and Praying places▪
the Pantheon is under the Altar, and descended
by stairs, though narrow, very light; at the en∣trance
of this rich Chappel, a Marble shines,
whose luster is heightned by reflexion of the
Gold, with which, all the iron work and part
of that fair stone are overlaid: In the middle
of it, and right against the Altar is a fair Can∣dlestick
of Brass, guilded, and in six several
niches, 24 Sepulchres of black Marble to re∣ceive
as many bodies: above the Gate are two
more. This stately monument is small, but
sumptuous, it was finished by the present King,
who about six months since placed there the
bodies of <HI>Charles</HI> the V, <HI>Philip</HI> the II, and <HI>Philip</HI>
the III. The first was most intire; in the niches
on the left, lie the Queens, and the last of them
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>Burbon.</HI> He that preached
the day that these seven Tombs or Sepulchres
had bodies laid in them, began by his appre∣hension
to speak in presence of so many Kings
who had conquered the world, and expressed
himself so well, and so highly pleased the King
that he got a yearly pension of a thousand
Crowns. Nothing attaining such perfection as
<PB N="76" REF="43"/>
to secure it from the Teeth of Criticks, the
three pieces I have now mentioned, have been
attacqued by them. It is objected against the
Library, that its entrance suits not with its Mag∣nificence
and Grandeur, and that it stands as if
stoln in, and not of the same piece with the
rest.</P>
<P>Over against the great Altar, where all is so
well proportioned, they wish away a silver
Lamp, whose size corresponds not with that of
the place it burns in, which is vast and large.
In the Pantheon they find great fault, that all
the steps by which it is descended are not Mar∣ble,
and that the sides of the walls are not in∣crusted
with it, the Chappel being all so, and a
like Magnificence requisite every where: In the
brazen Candlestick, the inner part which is not
guilded is discerned amongst the black and foul
branches that extend from it. It cost 10 thou∣sand
Crowns, which is ten times more then it is
worth; but it is common in this Countrey to
boast things of excessive price, which they
would have admired on that account, as if be∣cause
they are foolish Merchants, the ware
they buy too dear, were therefore the more va∣luable.
These are my observations of the so fa∣mous
Escurial, adorned only by some smal Par∣terras
and Fountains; one side of it affords a
handsome prospect, but the ground near it is the
greatest part Rock or Heath; some Walks and
Groves are planted about it, but being cold
and windy, trees thrive not. There are some
Deer in a kind of Park, ill designed, and with
<PB N="77" REF="43"/>
very low walls; the way to it is nothing plea∣sant,
and the King who goes thither thrice every
year, one of which times is in the Winter, can∣not
certainly find any great diversion in those
journeys, for during three months, all is cover∣ed
with snow. I have no more to say of these
two wonders of the world, <HI>The Escurial for Art,
and</HI> Aranjuez <HI>for Nature, The paralels of the
Son of</HI> Austria, (as is here said,) <HI>according to
times and fancies.</HI></P>
<P>The Twentieth of this month, all <HI>Madrid</HI>
assembled in the great Piazza to see the Bulls
fought; they mention this solemnity so ad∣vantagiously,
as if it were to be compared to
the Noblest Spectacles of the antients: every
Town of <HI>Spain</HI> hath several days set apart for
it, and not any one of them but enjoys this
pleasure about Midsummer. The people have so
great an esteem for it, that they think you ex∣treamly
injure them if you prefer it not to all
others, and if you seem not to admire all its cir∣cumstances,
you may as safely deny their King
to be the greatest in the world.</P>
<P>The prospect of the Piazza this day must needs
be very agreeable: People of the best quality adorn
all the Windows and Balconies, hung with Silks
and Tapestrys of divers colours, with the great∣est
ostentation possible: Each Council hath
its Balcony hung with Velvet or Damask, with
a Scutcheon of the Arms belonging to it. The
Kings is guilded, and under a State; the Queen
and Infanta sit by him, and the Favorite or
chief Minister in a corner of it; on his right
<PB N="78" REF="44"/>
hand is another great Balcony for the Ladies of
the Court, the rest are promiscuously taken up
by others. Both men and women set out them∣selves
to all advantage possible, paying very dear
for the Balconies; those on the first and second
stories cost Twenty or five and Twenty Crowns,
though the first rank cannot contain above
five or six persons: the King pays for those of
such as are considerable to him, as Ambas∣sadors
and Envoies of forreign Princes. Be∣fore
the Balconies are Scaffolds that extend some
feet into the Piazza; they are extreamly croud∣ed,
all the people taking places dearer or cheap∣er
according to the posts they make choice
of.</P>
<P>Though these solemnities are very frequent,
three or four being yearly celebrated in <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
the meanest Citizen will not once neglect
to see them, and rather pawn his Goods then
fail for want of Money. This takes its name
of distinction from <HI>St Isidore,</HI> protector of the
Town, which therefore bears the charge; the
reason it passes not for a Royal Spectacle; it
costs the King nevertheless something, and I
was told, he gives every Council that day Three
thousand Crowns: those at <HI>Midsummer</HI> and
<HI>September</HI> are most esteemed, when several en∣ter
the Lists a horseback, whereas at this of
<HI>St Isidore</HI> all do it afoot. There are four passages
to the Piazza, which is strewed with Sand, and
freed from those moving Shops or Booths that
at other times pester it; some ride, others walk
about it till the King appears, then his Guards
<PB N="79" REF="44"/>
break through the croud, and place themselves
on each side to attend him: as soon as their
Majesties are seated in their Balconies, all go
out of the Piazza, which being cleared, fully
discovers its beauty. At the same time four or
five <HI>Alguazils</HI> well mounted, and better then
becomes ordinary catchpoles, attend bare∣headed,
and as soon as the King gives the word,
he of them that hath authority over the Wag∣gons,
causes them to move from the place they
stand ranged in, and the barrels and sheep∣skins
that are in them, distil water so artificially,
that the whole Piazza is equally bedewed: af∣ter
which, they immediately depart by the four
Gates, which are shut as soon as they which are
to fight the Bulls are entered; amongst these gal∣lant
champions was a fellow of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> mount∣ed
on a Bull, he had mannaged and accustomed
to bridle and saddle; one a foot carrying his
Lance by him: he rid streight up to the King,
and after a profound obeisance, endeavoured to
shew his own and his Bulls address; he caused
him to trot, gallop, and turn every way, but
that undisciplinable creature, weary at last of
the tediousness of the mannage, fell a kicking
and bounding so fiercely, he threw the poor
Peasant, who not at all daunted at his misfor∣tune,
ran after his Bull that made away, at∣tended
by the hooting of all the assistance till
he had retaken him; but these quickly began
again, for as soon as an <HI>Alguazil</HI> had recei∣ved
the keys of the place where the Bulls were
inclosed, which <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> threw to
<PB N="80" REF="45"/>
him in observence of the custom, which re∣quires
the Kings giving them to his favorite, and
his casting them from the Balcony to the <HI>Al∣guazils;</HI>
and that those wild beasts were let
loose, and furiously attacqued one another; his,
though so well mannaged and harnassed, set on
a running without regard either to spur or bri∣dle,
making it impossible for his Master to en∣gage,
who stood prepared to that purpose with
his Lance in Rest; so without any other effect
then the laughter of the assistants, after se∣veral
attempts, he retreated without striking
stroke, though his Bull and he had received
many from those that avoided not the shock,
but ran to it. At the beginning of this sport
they usually let one Bull loose after another, who
according to his greater or lesser fury with pre∣cipitation
attaques such as are within the Lists,
whom he soon drives away; but such as are slow∣er
then the rest, when they can no longer avoid
him, fall flat at their lengths, or present him their
Hats or Cloaks; he passes by those that lie on
the ground without hurting them, because when
he gores he shuts his eyes, and commonly
strikes nothing but the Air; they which pre∣sent
their Cloaks or Hats, by them, put a stop
to his rage, which lighting on any thing, is sa∣tisfied.
What I have hitherto mentioned, is but
the farce; the serious part, and that in which
the activity consists, is the darting certain Ar∣rows
or little Javelins, which the skilful fix be∣tween
the Bulls horns, with admirable dexte∣rity,
without which they would be torn in
<PB N="81" REF="45"/>
pieces. A Barber signalized himself, the Bull feel∣ing
the smart of these little Javelins, (which for
their better support through the Air are wing∣ed
with red Paper) grows to a higher rage,
whilst by his strugling and tormenting himself, the
iron heads piercei farther. It is said, that be∣tween
the horns of these creatures is a little
place, so very tender and delicate that the smal∣lest
wound there is mortal; at which some of
the Champions can aim so well, that they kill
a Bull at the first stroke; when he seems almost
tired and spent, the Trumpets sound, the signal
to hamstring him: then with Swords and Hang∣ers
they endeavor to cut the sinews of his hin∣der
legs, after which, thrusts and slashes which
they call Cuchilladas showre on the poor beast.
In this the common people make their bloody in∣clination
apparent, for such as can come at him,
would scarcely think themselves sons of honest
Mothers, did they not plunge their Daggers in
his body, after which, <HI>quasi re bene gesta,</HI> they
march off triumphantly: When he moves no
more, Mules come a gallop to draw him out
of the Lists, and another is let loose. About
a score were killed that day, the skins so
pinked, they could be of no use but to make
Sives; Dogs are sometimes set against them when
it is too troublesome and dangerous for men
to joyn them, and the pleasure would sure be
greater, if when the dogs have fastened on them,
they forbore wounding them on all sides: the
only horseman that appeared this day, was the
Buffoon of Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI> the same that
<PB N="82" REF="46"/>
shewed himself at <HI>Aranjuez;</HI> he made one car∣rier
with his Lance handsome enough, but the
King unwilling he should get mischief, caused
him to retire. This manner of fight is to be
performed with short stirrups, otherwise a leg
may be easily spoiled; not with mannaged hor∣ses,
but such only as are fleet, and have tender
mouths: when the Bulls are to be attacqued
on horseback, such as have horses proper for
it, cannot handsomly refuse to lend them, nor
with honour pretend to any satisfaction, if (as
it often happens) they be spoiled in the service.</P>
<P>This days sport properly belonging to Pea∣sants,
one such, in affront to Cavaliers, came in
mounted on an Ass, which the Bull at first over∣threw,
but the fellow having recovered his cou∣rage,
and silly animal, attacqued the Bull with so
good success, that he gave him a great wound
between the horns, which bled extremely: af∣ter
so gallant an exploit, he begged the Bull of
the King, which being given him he went
away with his famous prize, better satisfied then
if crowned with Laurel. The Bull oftentimes falls
upon the Guards, who stand ranked on one
side of the Piazza with Darts and Halbards;
if they kill him he is theirs; he twice charged
them through, and overthrew some of them,
nothing of gallantry appearing on their side, who
suffered the Bull to trample on their bellies, in∣stead
of killing him at their feet. The Algu∣azils
or Serjeants are very conspicuous, with fair
embroidered Saddles, and their horses adorned
with Ribands, and tassels; they were very nim∣ble
<PB N="83" REF="46"/>
in quitting all places the Bulls approached,
and it had been the best of the sport to have
seen them charged home, at least this was
most wished, but by the readiness of their
flight, they escaped these horns, though probably
not those which are so common in <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>The grand solemnity begins not till the af∣ternoon,
but five or six Bulls are attacqued in
the morning, for the sakes of such as cannot
be present afterwards: at this, order is not so
well observed, which sometimes occasions mis∣chief.
I was told that this day in the morning
several were hurt, and one kill'd by a horn that
entred by his eye. They end not but with day-light,
and every Gallant gives his Mistriss a Bal∣cone
and Collation. In all the circumstances of
this diversion, a certain inveterate cruelty derived
from <HI>Africk,</HI> and hat forsook not this Coun∣trey
with the Moor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is very remarkable: for
the pleasure of ordinary Spaniards is not fight∣ing
the Bulls, the rabble delighting in nothing
so much as shedding his blood. At <HI>Tunis</HI> and
<HI>Algier</HI> are the like solemnities, but (as they
say) with greater splendor.</P>
<P>As the publick sports, the Moors introduced
in <HI>Spain;</HI> whilst they possessed it, continue after
their exile; the Church also retains something
of their superstition, especially on <HI>Corpus Chri∣sti</HI>
day. The Twenty seventh of <HI>May</HI> we saw all
its Ceremonies, which are many, and last long;
they begin by a procession, whose first ranks
are intermixed with several Hoboies, Tabors,
and Castanettas, a great many habited in par∣ty
<PB N="84" REF="47"/>
coloured clothes, skip and dance as extrava∣lantly
as at a Morrice. The King goes
to <HI>St Maries</HI> Church not far from his Palace,
and after Mass, returns with a Torch in his
hand, following a silver Tabernacle, in which
is the Holy Wafer, attended by the Grandes of
<HI>Spain,</HI> and his several Councils. This day to a∣void
dispute, they observe not order, so that the
Counsellors <HI>de la Hazienda,</HI> joyn with those
of the <HI>Indies;</HI> before these Counsellors and cer∣tain
other persons, move Machines, represent∣ing
Giants; these are Statues of Pasbord car∣ried
by men concealed under them: they are
of several shapes, some very hideous; all of
them represent Femals, except ths first, which
is only the Figure of a great head painted, with∣in
which is concealed a little man that gives
it meen and motion: it being a <HI>Colossus</HI> over
the body of a Pigmie. Amongst these chimeri∣cal
Monsters, there is one which represents two
Giantesses, Moors, or Aethiopians, such having
really been if we may beleeve the vulgar, who
call them <HI>Hios de Vicinos,</HI> that is, neighbors chil∣dren.
The people are so taken with these
Gothick figures, that there is scarce any Vil∣lage
without them. They report the Giantesses
to have lived in the time of King <HI>Mammelin,</HI>
and on that account sometimes call them
<HI>Mammelins,</HI> after the name of that Gothick
or Moorish King, who once Reigned in <HI>Spain.</HI>
I was told of another terrible Pageant which
they call <HI>Tarasca,</HI> from a wood that was for∣merly
in <HI>Province,</HI> where at present stands the
<PB N="85" REF="47"/>
City of <HI>Tarascon</HI> on the banks of <HI>Rosne,</HI> over
against <HI>Beaucaire.</HI> They fancy that in this
place was once a Serpent (no less enemy of
Mankind, then that which seduced our first An∣cestors
in Paradice) called <HI>Behemoth,</HI> and re∣port
that <HI>St Martha</HI> by oraisons triumphed
over it, leading it prisoner in her apron strings.
Be this History or Fable, the <HI>Tarasca</HI> is a Ser∣pent
of enormous greatness, in form of a Wo∣man,
moving on wheels, the body covered
with scales, a vast belly, long tail, short feet,
sharp talons, fiery eyes, gaping mouth, out of
which extend three tongues, and long tusks.
This Bulbegger stalks up and down and they
which are under the pastboard and paper, of
which it is composed, by certain Springs, cause
it to move so dexterously, that it puts off the
Hat to the Sots that stare at it, and sometimes
lays hold on Countrey fellows, whose fright
moves laughter amongst the people. Such as
please themselves in telling wonders of this fop∣pery,
relate that a certain Town having sent to
some of its neighbors six of these paper Giants,
two Pigmies, and the Tarasca to be made use
of on <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> day, they which give them
their motion being entred, to divert themselves
in the passage, caused them to dance as at pro∣cessions
by couples: they were met by certain
Muliters or Carriers, who (Moonshine disco∣vering
at a distance, these imaginary Monsters,)
marching with a great deal of prattle and
loud laughter, for their merrier passing two
<PB N="86" REF="48"/>
or three Leagues) not recollecting what was
to be done the day after, were so affrighted,
that the terror still augmenting, by their con∣templating
those fantasmes, they at last run
away with all their might. The conducters of
the Monsters perceiving this, casting off their
Vizards, went out of the Machines to disabuse
them, running after them to cause them to come
back to their Mules and charges; this increased
their astonishment, and hastened their pace,
which aided by the wings of fear, soon trans∣ported
them cross the fields to a village, which
they allarmed to free the Countrey of high∣way
men, so hideous, they could be little less
then Devils: the other in the mean time slip∣ping
their cases, and perceiving themselves ma∣sters
of the the spoils, the muletiers had aban∣doned,
began to visit the baggage, and finding
Wine, drank so much they fell fast asleep till
morning. The Muletiers after their raising the
Village, and bringing the Justice to the place,
perceived their mistake, and the Countrey fel∣lows
laughing heartily at them, drank the re∣mainder
of the Wine in recompence of their
trouble. The Village of the solemnity, a great
while waited for those grim Puppets, which
came too late, and by their excuse and relati∣on
of what had happened, disordered the whole
procession, changing it into a Ring of such as
abandoned the Cross and Banner, to heark∣en
to their story. The pleasantest posture of these
Mammelinas that I saw was, when they made
their salutes before the Queens Balcony, be∣sides
<PB N="87" REF="48"/>
some seats of activity by address of those
that dance them. The King passing by it, salutes
the Queen with a smile, and the Queen and
Infanta rise a little before he comes at them,
to return his compliment; The Procession ha∣ving
filed to the Piazza, returns by the High
street or Calle Major, adorned by many Ta∣pestries
waving on the Balconies, filled with men
and women of all conditions: the croud is so
great, one cannot pass without difficulty, and
we had much ado to return to <HI>St Maries</HI>
Church where the procession ended. As soon
as free from it we went to the Palace, and
there saw the King, Queen, and Infanta, return
with all the Court Ladies: I think I have men∣tioned
all that is worth notice, unless it be that
as on this day all the men put on Summer
cloaths, so do all the Ladies, and those new and
very rich, of several fashions and colours. In
the afternoon about five a clock, <HI>Autos</HI> are re∣presented:
these are ghostly Comedies, with
interludes, very ridiculous to give rellish to what
is serious and tedious in the pieces themselves.</P>
<P>The two companies of Players that belong
to <HI>Madrid</HI> at this time, shut their Theaters,
and for a month represent these Holy Poems:
this they do every evening in publick on Scaf∣folds
erected to that purpose in the streets be∣fore
the houses of the Presidents of several
Councils. They begin at Court the day of the
Solemnity, where a seat under a State is pro∣vided
for their Majesties: the Stage is at the
foot of these Scaffolds, and little painted Booths
<PB N="88" REF="49"/>
rowled to it, environ it, and serve as tiring
houses. This is continued certain days, every
President having one, and a Stage and Scaffold
erected before his house: before these <HI>Autos</HI>
begin, all the foppery of the Procession dances,
and the Gigantine Machines make the people
sport; but what I most admired in that which I
saw at a distance in the old <HI>Prado,</HI> is, that in the
streets and open air they use Torches to those
pieces, which in the daily Theaters, and with∣in
doors, they represent without other light
then that of the Sun: all these antick ceremo∣nies
appeared much more ridiculous to those
that beheld them, then they can possibly do in
my describing them, and confirm me in what
I often observed, that the Spaniards, and other
wise and grave nations seem fondest in their di∣versions,
as Misers at their Feasts sometimes
become most prodigal.</P>
<P>The next day the Alguazils came to the
house where we lodged to demand account of
our hoste of his provision of victuals and what
Poultry he fatted. They were very inquisitive,
what he did with such abundance, and where
and why he had bought it; he told them we
gave him Money to be our Caterer, but this
would not serve his turn, because so great store
is forbidden by Law, and gives a jealousie that
the Master of the house keeps an Ordinary or
Pension, which is not allowed: besides all which
certain witnesses deposed that he sent victuals
abroad to some of the company that lay sick,
and that he bought some at the private Kit∣chins
<PB N="89" REF="49"/>
of Don <HI>Lewis</HI> de <HI>Haro</HI> and others, all ve∣ry
streightly prohibited. The reason why nei∣ther
Ordinaries nor Pensions are allowed in <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
nor any part of <HI>Spain,</HI> seems very strange,
when they tell you that consideration of the ste∣rility
of the Countrey, gives apprehension of
Famine, and an entire disfurnishing the Markets
by those that keep such houses; for it appears
to me, that liberty being left to every one to
buy what he pleases, and as much as he pleases,
provided it be by his Domestick, the same in∣convenience
will no less follow.</P>
<P>However, it is good to keep out of the
Laws clutches in <HI>Spain;</HI> especially, in occasions
where the Catchpoles interpose; for, for a matter
of nothing, they seize and carry away all, and
the Master to prison, from whence he escapes
not without the aid of Money, be his cause right
or wrong; especially, if he be thought rich:
false witnesses are never wanting, and here
the neighbors had deposed against our hoste out
of envy; but his good luck was to be Tenant
to an Alguazil; this Serjeant mediating with
his Comrades, assisted by four pistols, the In∣formation
was cancelled, and our Host not car∣ried
to prison as they had intended: by this,
all here appears vendible, though had this cheat
of the Alguazils been complained of they had
run hazard of being sent to the Gallies. This
was almost the only punishment inflicted in those
times by reason of want of men to be em∣ployed
at the Oar.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="50"/>
An Assentista, that is a Patentee or Farmer
of Levies of soldiers, or of the Kings Revenue,
was a little before assaulted in his chamber by
Theeves, one of which being taken, discover∣ed
his confederates; amongst whom, (though
they set daggers at his throat, and wounded him
in the head) was a Frier; the first with his
Comrade was whipped and sent to the Gallies,
and the Frier condemned to pass the remainder of
his days between four walls with bread and wa∣ter.
This man being a stranger, little befriend∣ed,
and ignorant of the customes of the Coun∣try,
had much ado to obtain this Justice. He
was born at St. <HI>Omer,</HI> but resides ordinarily at
<HI>London,</HI> from whence he sends Irishmen to serve
in <HI>Catalonia.</HI> Such French as they take at Sea are
in like manner sent to the Gallies, from which
none can be freed, without putting one in his
place, which costs dear, there being no other
way but to find out some <HI>Negro</HI> Slave.</P>
<P>The Commerce of the Indies hath restored
rights of servitude in these Countries, and in
<HI>Andalusia</HI> there are few other Servants. The
greatest part of these are either Moors or perfect
Blacks, which gives occasion to the Proverb, <HI>No as∣si
tratan los hombres Blancos:</HI> White Men are not
be so used. Christianity requires, that such as
embrace it be enfranchised, but this is not ob∣served
in <HI>Spain,</HI> and those wretches are not
made freemen by becomming Christians. They
are much more cruelly used in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
inhumanity hath so long prevailed, that all ima∣ginable
rigor is exercised on those unhappy crea∣tures,
<PB N="91" REF="50"/>
who are only such by occasion of their
Mines of Gold and Silver, to which their Ma∣sters
owe all their fortune and greatness. An in∣credible
number of them found their graves,
whilest they digged for those Metals, so that
scarce any remain to pursue that fatal imploy∣ment.
Besides this destruction made by the
Mines, it is said the Wine sent thither, occasi∣ons
so many diseases, that the greatest part of
the Indians die. They are passionate Lovers of
this liquor, and spare nothing that may obtain
it; and the Spaniards to discover the Treasures
they may have concealed, sell it them, to the
ruin of their goods, health, and strength for la∣bour;
and I remember to have read a Book in∣tituled
<HI>Las Excellentias del Espannol,</HI> in four or
five Chapters where the Author makes appear
the prejudice the King and Traffick of the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
receive by the Vines planted in <HI>Peru;</HI> and
often repeats, that the vice of the West-Indians
being Drunkenness, many of them perish by
Wine, not like their <HI>Chica,</HI> made of Maiz and
more agreeable to their Constitutions; besides
that, the Spaniards to get more, and by selling it
cheap, to make quicker returns, falsifie it, in such
a manner, it is little better than poison. On
these occasions the Indians are so much wasted,
that for some years there have not been enough
to work in the Vine-yards nor Mines of <HI>Peru.</HI>
Negro's are therefore made use of, bought in
<HI>Guine,</HI> or the Kingdom of <HI>Angola;</HI> by which
means the profit is much lessened, a Negro cost∣ing
50 or 60 Crowns, and since <HI>Portugal</HI> hath
<PB N="92" REF="51"/>
re-established their true King, and that all those
Countries of the <HI>Indies</HI> that are strongest in Co∣lonies,
have acknowledged him, Negro's are
not had so cheap; for besides the 60 Pieces of
Eight they cost, the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath laid
an Impost equal to the Price, so that a Negro
comes not to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> where they land, till
he stands the Spaniards in above 200 Crowns.
The profit the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> makes by this, is
incredible, those that understand Trade, assu∣ring
it amounts yearly to some Millions of Gold.
The consideration of this and some other things
before mentioned, make evident to me what I
was often told at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the great wealth
of the <HI>Indies</HI> belongs more to particular persons
and strangers, than to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and
that at this time when the Gallions are expected
richer than in many late years, because of the
return of the Viceroy, it is thought 3 quarters
of what it brings is on account of Merchant Stran∣gers,
and that there will not come to the King
and natural Spaniards above Three Millions of
Gold.</P>
<P>They which manage the Affairs of that Coun∣trey,
very prosperously advance their own, and
the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI> President of its Council,
draws vast sums for Licences to French Mer∣chants;
One I knew, that for leave to bring a
hundred Hides from St. <HI>Domingo</HI> by the Gallions,
gave Ten Pistols. Notwithstanding all which,
much deceit is used in that particular, and the
greatest part of the French that trade into <HI>Spain,</HI>
import and export at their pleasure all manner of
<PB N="93" REF="51"/>
Commodities, by pretending to be Walloons,
Burgundians, Lorrainers, or Flemings. For
this reason the King was counselled to give free∣dom
to trade, and to abolish the Fees of Licen∣ces,
and Impost of the Tenth Peny on all French
Merchandise; representing that his profit would
be greater, because the usual duties would be
paid without any fraud; whereas to avoid this
Tenth, the Merchants combine, and they that
have French Goods, get one or other to attest
they are English or Flemmish, and so (at most)
pay but the ordinary Custom, of which also
they are sometimes crafty enough to deceive
him.</P>
<P>The Commerce of these is principally in <HI>An∣dalusia,</HI>
where they have found a place of free∣dom
as convenient as <HI>Cadis;</HI> this is the haven of
<HI>Santa Maria,</HI> a little Town belonging to the
Duke af <HI>Medina Coeli,</HI> who protects them, and
draws great Trade to the prejudice of <HI>Cadis</HI> and
<HI>Sevil.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were at peace, Traf∣fick
was more difficult then at present, little Mer∣chandise
arriving that was not confiscated under
pretence of coming from <HI>Holland.</HI> There never
wanted two or three Knights of the Post to
swear this, but time and care have given remedy
to this mischief, and false swearers escape not,
Merchants by presenting a Bever, or some other
Knack, putting themselves under the protection
of some Grande.</P>
<P>By this is evident that <HI>Spain</HI> cannot well be
without Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> not only on the
<PB N="94" REF="52"/>
Frontiers of <HI>Biscai</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> where it hath
been almost ever permitted, but through the
whole Countrey where it is prohibited, for <HI>Pro∣vence</HI>
hath ever had correspondencies in the
Kingdom of <HI>Valentia,</HI> by its necessity of the o∣thers
Commodities; and for the same reason
<HI>Britaign, Normandy,</HI> and other parts on the O∣cean
have continually sent theirs to <HI>Cadis</HI> and
<HI>Bilbo.</HI> I speak not of Corn and Stuffs of all sorts
brought from that Country, but even of Iron∣work
and Sword; by which it appears a mistake
to think that in these dayes the best come out of
<HI>Spain.</HI> No more being now made at <HI>Toledo,</HI>
few but forrain are used, unless a very small
quantity that come from <HI>Biscai,</HI> which are ex∣cessivly
dear.</P>
<P>It is moreover hard to imagine how much
<HI>Spain</HI> suffers for want of manufactures: So few
Artificers remain in its Towns, that native Com∣modities
are carried abroad to be wrought in
forrain Countries. Wools and Silks are trans∣ported
raw, and being spun and weaved in <HI>Eng∣land,
France,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> return thither at dear
rates. The Land it self is not tilled by the peo∣ple
it feeds. In Seed-time, Harvest, and Vintage,
Husbandmen come from <HI>Bearn</HI> and other parts
of <HI>France,</HI> who get a great deal of money by sow∣ing
and reaping their Corn, and dressing and
cutting their Vines. Carpenters and Masons
are (for the most part) also strangers, who will
be paid treble what they can get in their own
Countrey. In <HI>Madrid</HI> there is hardly a Water-bearer
that is not a Foreigner, such are also the
<PB N="95" REF="52"/>
greatest part of Shoomakers and Taylors, and it
is believed the third of these come only to get a
little money and afterwards return home, but
none thrive so much as Architects, Masons, and
Carpenters. Almost every house hath wooden
windows (here being no glass) and a balcony
jutting into the Street. Once in five years all
Fabricks are re-builded, of which the Frontis∣piece
only is done with Lime, the sides and back-parts,
being usually earth.</P>
<P>Every house in <HI>Madrid</HI> pays duties to the
King which mount high, the first floor of eve∣ry
one is his, which if not redeemed, he may
sell at his pleasure; This the Proprietors usually
buy, to do which if they be not able they build
no more but it alone. This is the reason there
are so many little houses in <HI>Madrid,</HI> with only
one stair to get up to the Garret. The most con∣siderable
Architecture is that which is adorned
with some Tower, only one of these is allowed,
and he that will build more, must have permis∣sion
to do it: A fellow that thought he should
have much ado to obtain this, begged leave but
for one, which being easily granted, he built
one on account of the permission, and another
because one had never been prohibited. No∣thing
is more notorious, then that <HI>Madrid</HI>
wanting both some Rivolet to void its filth and
Vault to receive it, casts all into the Street; but
it is admirable to see that by vivacity and pene∣tration
of the Air, all is consumed in a moment,
it being as drying and corrosive (if one may so
call it) as lime that devours a body before the
<PB N="96" REF="53"/>
corruption discovers it self, and I have found
dead Dogs and Cats in the Streets that smelt
not, by which we may perceive they had reason
that chose this place for the Seat of their Kings,
the Air being not only hard to corrupt, but
takes away even the cause of corruption, by dis∣solution
of Elementary qualities as sudden as
imperceptible. In antient times their Queens
repaired hither to lie in, that the Princes might
at their births breath an Air whose purity is not
to be equalized. The Waters of this place have
been weighed against several other, and none
have been found so light. The Cardinal Infant
had them carried with him into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and
great care was taken to ship for him Tuns of the
same the King drinks, the Fountain of which is a
little without the Town. The Streets here being
Common Shores, one ran great hazard, were it
allowed at all hours to cast out at window what
the people will no longer keep in their houses;
but from day break til ten at Night this is forbid∣den
under a pecuniary mulct. Once I remember
I saw a Woman that had forgot this, whom the
Serjeants, that wait on such little advantages,
immediately caused to pay the Fine, which is
Sixty Rials, about <HI>25 s.</HI> of our Money. They
which walk a Nights, carry neither Torch nor
Lantern, which I never saw born before any,
whether in Coach, a horsback, or a foot; La∣dies
of quality only make use of these, such as
belong to the Court especially, who then mu∣ster
all their Footmen. Women here go abroad
with much more splendor than their Husbands,
<PB N="97" REF="53"/>
for besides a great number of servants about
their Sedans, a Steward or Master of the Horse
still follows them on horseback: in great houses,
Footmen neither enter their Lords chamber,
nor yet his apartment, they being served by
their Gentlemen, Pages, and other Officers;
when called, they kneel, receiving their
Commands; this custom hath gone higher in
the Favourites family, for I have been assured,
that when Don <HI>Lewis</HI> gives Audience, and his
Secretary serves as Interpreter, he kneels; and
what is stranger, that <HI>Fernando de Contreras</HI>
(none of his Domestick, but the Kings servant,
and the most considerable of his Secretaries of
State, as having charge of the <HI>Despecho</HI> Univer∣sal)
pays him that honour. For what concerns
the respect due to the King and all such as are
near him; they have many little customs very
extraordinary; amongst others, that no man ever
mounts a horse the King hath once made use
of: and they say, that after the taking of <HI>Bar∣cellona,</HI>
in the Cavalcade his Majesty made to
<HI>Atocha;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Medina de los torres,</HI> sent
to present him his most beautiful horse that
was so famous in <HI>Madrid;</HI> but the King re∣turned
him saying, <HI>Scrina lastima,</HI> that is, it
were pity, since by that means he would be∣come
useless, and rid only by Querries: and in∣deed
no horses are so little rid as the Kings,
who almost burst with fat, acquired by continu∣al
standing in the Stable, which is not very well
furnished, because he gives away the best; he
lately sent the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> Twelve of the
<PB N="98" REF="54"/>
greatest value; the wars have made horses very
scarse and dear in <HI>Spain,</HI> especially in the be∣ginning
of winter, when all provide themselves
to ride about the streets of <HI>Madrid,</HI> whose dirt
is so troublesome, it can neither be avoided nor
got out of any thing it lights on.</P>
<P>They are cheaper in <HI>June,</HI> people going afoot
during the fair weather, which lasts till the end
of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>We were told of another custom, no less
extraordinary, that no natural Son of the
King, owned to be such, may enter <HI>Madrid;</HI>
and that Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> who at pre∣sent,
Commands in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> was never there,
he was bred at <HI>Ocanna,</HI> some Leagues from the
Court where the King sometimes visited him,
and not long since he was within a League of
this Town where he also met him. It is belie∣ved
this King hath more such issue, but being
by Ladys of quality, he owns them not; he sel∣dom
attempted any without success; yet a cer∣tain
Lady of <HI>Madrid,</HI> is reported to have been
inexorable to him, though she was not so to
all the world; she still excused her self with pro∣testations
of as much esteem as respect for his
person, but that she could not without hor∣ror
apprehend to become a whore of Hi∣story.</P>
<P>I enquired the reason why the Kings natu∣ral
issue may not come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> but found
none could satisfie me; for that which is gene∣rally
received, that it is to avoid disputes of
the precedence between them and the Grandes
<PB N="99" REF="54"/>
of <HI>Spain,</HI> is of no validity, since I have seen
a Letter of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> to <HI>Don John</HI> of
<HI>Austria,</HI> which treats him, not only with High∣ness,
but most Serene Highness; but whatso∣ever
the cause may be that the Gates of the
Court are thus shut against them, and of the
jealousie real or imaginary, might be occasi∣oned
by their presence there; it is most certain
that this nation hath a great deal, for whatso∣ever
in the least concerns it in love or Honour,
of which, many little stories of daily passages
in <HI>Madrid</HI> are related, where the extravagance
of Women produces various passions in the com∣merce
of criminal Gallantry, which hath its
punctilios of honor as well as a knot of high∣way
men, its justice within it self; They which
keep <HI>Amancebadas;</HI> that is, Mistrisses main∣tained
at their charge, are more jealous of them
then of their wives; and such of these as have
a servant that ordinarily visits them, call him In∣fidel
and Traytor, if they ever know he goes to
others, and to this purpose I have been told that
the King himself being with a Lady the Ad∣miral
of <HI>Castille</HI> kept, that young lord trans∣ported
by jealousie, forgetting all respect and
consideration, having knocked violently at the
door, gave the Mother of that wench who open∣ed
it, many boxes on the ear, saying, Jade,
thou makest me Cuckold, but if I could get
up, I would strangle both thee and thy daughter,
were it in the Kings presence.</P>
<P>Though the Profession of Curtisans admits no
conceptions but of interest and design for rapine,
<PB N="100" REF="55"/>
they are sometimes excellent Counterfeiters of
Passion, and borrow the transports of real af∣fection.
The Earl of <HI>Fieschi,</HI> who at his first
arrival at <HI>Madrid,</HI> passionately attacked that
Sex, tells as a Gallantry, his usage by one of
those Cattle, who openly at the <HI>Tour</HI> fell upon
him with reproaches of infidelity, calling him
<HI>Traidor</HI> and <HI>Picaro,</HI> because she had heard he
had a new Mistress.</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>de Mogeron</HI> was not a little surprized, by
a Womans treating him in the same manner one
Evening, pulling him by the hair with reproaches
and injuries; because he had not visited her ac∣cording
to a promise made her at the <HI>Tour,</HI> where
he met her the day before. They do a thousand
such extravagances, and are really Mistresses of
the Epithite <HI>Bizarre,</HI> which in their Language
is understood in so good a sense. They are ridi∣culous
in their habit, and wear their richest ac∣coutrements
under others very homely, so that
you would not take any of them to be braver
than the rest, unless you see them at some Festival,
or that as they pass by, they let the Clinquant of
their Wastcotes appear; their Linnen is Cam∣brick
most generally used and best esteemed in
<HI>Spain:</HI> they paint not their faces only, but change
also the colour of those parts that least appear.
Their Smocks are also laid with Bonelaces, where
visible only to their Gallants, indeed of those
slight ones that are made in <HI>Provence</HI> or <HI>Lorrain,</HI>
those of <HI>Flanders</HI> being unknown to them, un∣less
when they force some bits of them from
Strangers, tearing their Bands or Cuffs.</P>

Besides the great numbers of loose Women
that are to be found up and down <HI>Madrid,</HI> there
are others in certain fixed quarters, countenan∣ced
by Publick Authority, for accommodation
of any that will go to them. These are called
<HI>Cantonera's,</HI> perhaps <HI>Bulkers.</HI> They have a Sa∣lary
from the Town, for which cause so infamous
an imployment is sought after, and when one of
the Jades dies or is disabled by the Pox, the Ma∣gistrates
are sollicited for the vacancy. What
their Pension is I could not learn, but those
which assured me of this beastly establishment,
told me that every one that visits them is obliged
to pay them 12 <HI>Quarto</HI>'s, about 6 Pence of our
Money. Physitians are fee'd by the publick, to
take care they be free from those Pestilential Dis∣eases
that are gained by so honourable a Professi∣on.
A Matron also belongs to them, who is
obliged to advertise the Magistrate or Physitian,
as soon as she discovers any thing amiss. They
which described to me the lives of these miserable
creatures, told me that when they are accompa∣nied,
a second man is never admitted, on which
account there never happens any disorder; the
first enterer leaving his Sword and Dagger at the
Door, which when they which come after per∣ceive,
they retire without more ado. Sinning
thus with impunity and toleration of Publick Au∣thority▪
they seldom forsake the vice they so
openly professe, though one day in the year is
devoted to exhort them to repentance: On a
Friday in <HI>Lent,</HI> they are by an <HI>Alguazil</HI> or
two conducted to the Church of Penitents, and
<PB N="102" REF="56"/>
there seated near the Pulpit, where the Preacher
does his best to touch their hearts, but seldom
with success; after many vain exhortations to
amend their lives, descending from his Pulpit, he
presents them the Crucifix, saying, <HI>Behold the
Lord, embrace him;</HI> which if any does, she is
immediately taken away, and shut up in the
Cloister of Penitents; but usually they only hang
down their heads and shed a few tears, without
laying hold on what is offered, and after their
grimaces continue their deboshed life; neither
can the Story of St. <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> so often
inculcated to them, move them to imitation
of her.</P>
<P>In this antick of remarques which I have dau∣bed
with so many colours, I must not forget what
concerns the imprisonment of the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain.</HI>
He failed but very little of an escape,
and that news had not come of his being enter∣ed
the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal</HI> when he was thought
still in the heart of <HI>Castille.</HI> As soon as he arri∣ved
in <HI>Spain</HI> he was confined to <HI>Toledo,</HI> without
being admitted to the Kings presence. When
misfortunes of War of State cast one Soveraign
into the hands of another, methinks he ought
not to be treated altogether as a Prisoner, but
that his Captivity should be made use of, to
work upon him and gain his affection by Offices
of honour and civility. Of the two French Kings
that were taken Prisoners, it is notoriously
known that <HI>Francis</HI> the First left <HI>Spain</HI> intirely
possessed by thoughts of hatred and re∣venge
on account of his ill usage by <HI>Charles</HI> the
<PB N="103" REF="56"/>
Fifth: and that <HI>John</HI> returned from <HI>England</HI> so
well satisfied, that he was ever afterward careful
to live with <HI>Edward</HI> as with a Friend and Bro∣ther:
but the Spanish austerity suffers not a Max∣ime
that may be deceitful, and graspes hard what∣ever
it laies hold on to prevent escape: She would
never let Duke <HI>Charles</HI> taste the air of her Court,
and notwithstanding his many instances, ever
treated him as a simple prisoner of State, though
she suffered him to go abroad under good Guard
both to Church and to take the Air, which in∣cited
him to attempt greater liberty. Thus he
laid his design, One of the Kings Coaches was
appointed to attend him, whose Coachman hap∣pened
to be a Lorrainer, and consequently his
subject. He supposed this mans affection to his
natural Prince, would oblige him to be assisting
towards his liberty, and resolved to have him
sounded. I could not learn whom he made use
of to engage him, nor in what manner he set it
a foot, but it is said, that having gained him, he
several times left Tickets under the Cushions of
the Coach, and the place he sate on, which the
Coachman very carefully took away; and by
means of a Lorrain Embroderer, sent to
those that had the principal management of the
Affair. This went so far before its discovery,
that the Coachman had received instructions to
drive the Duke very often beyond a ruinated
Building that was near the part he usually fre∣quented,
and one day, when least suspected, 50
Horsmen were appointed to lie concealed behind
it, who having killed his Guards and set him at
<PB N="104" REF="57"/>
liberty, were to convoy him to the Frontiers of
<HI>Portugal,</HI> where 500 Horse should be ready to
receive him. A Ticket, and perhaps the last
that was necessary to this Negotiation, discovered
it; for whether it were that it was not handsom∣ly
enough conveyed under the Cushion, or
whether the Captain that then commanded the
Guard, and was in the Coach with him, ob∣served
better what was done than others, or that
he was more jealous, going out of the Coach,
searching the Cushion, he found the Ticket;
upon this the Duke was more straitly shut up, the
Coachman imprisoned, and the Ticket sent to
<HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Dukes Secretary and the
Embroiderer were secured; the last of these was
racked, but the particulars of what he deposed
never published The light that appeared at the
bottom of this Affair, moved the Spaniards
themselves to say, <HI>That to hold the Duke faster
at the very time his liberty was most earnestly solli∣cited,
they perswaded him he would have made an
escape:</HI> whatever may be of it, it is certain the
Duke was not afterwards allowed to go out of
<HI>Toledo,</HI> and that this unfortunate Prince might
justly complain, <HI>That if the French Neighbour∣hood
was a smoke that drove him from his House
with tears in his eyes, the Spanish Friendship was
a fire that burnt him alive.</HI> Which if we may be∣lieve
publick report, was his own expression to
the Captain that guarded him. All that hath
been given out of the causes of his imprison∣ment
hath divulged but part of the mistery, and
I sought at <HI>Madrid</HI> to inform my self of the real
<PB N="105" REF="57"/>
motive. They which speak and judge most so∣lidly
say, <HI>That this was rather done on account of
reason of State, and to spare money, than that he
had indeed be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raied his party;</HI> and truly the taking
quarters in the Land of <HI>Liege</HI> that Winter, ren∣dred
him no more culpable that year, then his
seeking them at his Swords point had done in
those that went before: but the conjuncture dif∣fered,
and the Elector of <HI>Cullen,</HI> who had made
himself absolute Master of that people, desirous to
give them a more powerful protection, clamored
much at the Diet of <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> from whence,
as misfortune would have it, he retired dissatis∣fied
with the Emperour, for having decided to the
advantage of him of <HI>Mentz,</HI> the Dispute that
was between them about the Function of crown∣ing
the King of Romans. As soon as he arrived
at <HI>Cullen,</HI> he wrote to the Emperour, that
without speedy succors, according to the Laws of
the Empire, to free his Countrey from the deva∣stations
of the Lorrainers, he must have recourse
to the protection of some foraign Prince. This
Affair being taken into consideration, the Em∣perour
only wrote about it to <HI>Brusselles</HI> and <HI>Ma∣drid.</HI>
The Elector in the mean time took heat,
and resolving no longer to expect the event of
those delays, raised forces, treated with <HI>France,</HI>
and gave her opportunity of re-assuming the
Black Eagle in her Colours, and renuing the
Title of <HI>Preserver of the German Liberty.</HI> Car∣dinal
<HI>Mazzarin,</HI> who during his retirement
had been so well received by this Elector, lost
not the opportunity of making his acknowledg∣ments,
<PB N="106" REF="58"/>
and sent him Troops under the Com∣mand
of Monsieur <HI>Faber,</HI> which joyned to his
own, forced the Lorrainers to discamp, whom
it was resolved to pursue even into <HI>Brabant,</HI> to
revenge the havock they had made in the Land
of <HI>Liege,</HI> and assist the French in some Con∣quest.
I his bold proceeding, awaked the Em∣perors
jealousie, who perceived that in that ve∣ry
moment he had re-established his Authority
in the Empire, and when he had given an end to
a Diet, in which he had caused his Son to be
crowned King of Romans, one of the power∣fullest
Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> sought other pro∣tection
than his, and gave example to all his
Neighbours to do the like, as often as they
should be oppressed by Troops entertained by
<HI>Spain.</HI> These considerations obliged the Em∣perour
to send the Earl of <HI>Furstemberg</HI> to the
Elector of <HI>Cullen,</HI> to work him, and prevent
his going farther in the Treaty with the French,
promising him an effectual and real satisfaction
for what was passed, and for the future to esta∣blish
such order, he should no more need to ap∣prehend
the like visits. At the same time he
wrote to <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Brusselles,</HI> with all possi∣ble
efficacy, to represent the dangerous conse∣quences
of this Affair, how prejudicial it was
to him, and necessity of the remedies he pro∣posed,
which were to satisfie the Elector of
<HI>Cullen</HI> with Money, so to oblige him to lay
down Arms and dismiss the French, to make
sure of the person of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that
he might be no less so of his Conduct, the cause
<PB N="107" REF="58"/>
of all these inconveniences, and to use his Bro∣ther
Duke <HI>Francis</HI> for continuing the Army in
the Spanish Service, which he thought might
easily be prevailed upon, by giving it a Head of
the same Family, and presenting the Chief Offi∣cers
with money. These reasons and expedients
were the better rellished by the Spanish Mini∣sters,
out of apprehension of the Storm that
began to gather against them. The great
Services the Duke had rendered the House of
<HI>Austria,</HI> were of no advantage to him in their
Council, nor any thing examined but his avari∣tious
and unequal Politicks, his irresolutions a∣lone
were represented, and the times in which
he had declined their Service, when they might
have obtained great advantages, if he would
have acted with his forces.</P>
<P>The accompt was also cast up of the great
Sums he had cost the King of <HI>Spain</HI> yearly, by
a crafty selling him his Army as if at an outcry,
so that if they would make use of it in the be∣ginning
of a Campagne, or continue it at the
end of it, he must be paid at his own rates. It
was at last concluded as well at <HI>Madrid</HI> as <HI>Brus∣selles,</HI>
that for a certain remedy to all these mis∣chiefs,
to prevent falling again into the like in∣conveniences,
and put a stop to the preparati∣ons
making at <HI>Liege,</HI> the Elector was not only
to be indemnified, and the protection of the
Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> abandoned, but his person to
be seised on and sent into <HI>Spain.</HI> Thus this
Prince saw himself treated as a Soldier of for∣tune,
and not like a Soveraign, by a Family
<PB N="108" REF="59"/>
whose friendship caused the loss of his Countrey,
and reduced him to the sad necessity of living
like a vagabond at the Head of an Army that
subsisted only by his industry. If what hath
been reported of the first heats of his youth be
true, and that he then lamented he was not born
a private Gentleman, to try how far his wit and
courage could carry him; one would think he
had devested himself of his Dominions, only to
shew what he could do without them. That he
had very eminent parts, is undeniable, but over∣shadowed
by such uncouth Policies, and in such
a manner intermixed with humor and vanity,
that one would think he had but one Maxime
sacred and inviolable to him, <HI>To prefer what
was profitable above what was honourable or honest.</HI>
It is not therefore strange that he built his ruin
on so bad foundations, nor that after his imita∣tion
of that crafty <HI>Lewis</HI> the Moor Duke of <HI>Mi∣lan,</HI>
and all his shifts and slights of hand, he is
caught in a trap, from whence his deliverance
is very incertain, and whether he end not his
dayes in the Castle of <HI>Toledo,</HI> as the other did
in the Tower of <HI>Loches;</HI> though it is believed
here, that were his Army disbanded, his liberty
might be obtained without much difficulty, be∣cause
the Spaniards are confident they need ap∣prehend
nothing from this Prince, who loves
his money too well to employ it in his revenge,
and the 200 thousand Livres a year he is report∣ed
to have within the Dominions of the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> to forfeit them. To which they adde,
that were he desirous to take Arms, he needs the
<PB N="109" REF="59"/>
support of <HI>France,</HI> which he will probably fail
of obtaining, without an entire giving up <HI>Lor∣rain,</HI>
which they will either keep still, or re∣store
on conditions but little better, and such as
he will never accept, for fear of depriving him∣self
of what belongs to him for so small an ad∣vancement
towards his particular satisfaction.
On these grounds they adde, that even the Mi∣nisters
of <HI>Spain</HI> wish the destruction of his Ar∣my,
which in the fashion it subsists and is disci∣plined,
costs them very dear, but they would
gladly gather together its ruins, and incorporate
them with their other Troops, that their Ene∣mies
might not profit by them, the fear of
which hinders their undertaking it. This makes
evident that Princes are incommoded by Auxi∣liary
forces that serve in a Body, and under a
Head they own as their absolute Master, for it
is alwayes hard to oblige them to do well, and
no less difficult to disband or be quit of them,
and therefore the wisest Princes, that have been
necessitated to make use of such, have at first
endeavoured to separate and mix them with
their own, to prevent their correspondence,
and diminish the Authority of those that
brought them. The Venetians once endeavo∣red
to deal in this manner with the Marquis of
<HI>Roquelaure,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> at relie∣ving
<HI>Berghen ap Zome,</HI> would have obliged
<HI>Mansfelt</HI> to suffer such a separation: but nei∣ther
of them would consent, but made ap∣pear
that this is not to be propounded or ob∣tained,
but of a Soldier of fortune, that hath
<PB N="110" REF="60"/>
drawn together forces he is not able to make
subsist.</P>
<P>The most publick curiosity, whilst we were in
<HI>Spain,</HI> was to divine the designes of that Fleet
<HI>Cromwel</HI> sent into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and at our arrival
at <HI>Vittoria,</HI> being saluted by a man of good pre∣sence,
who enquired what was spoken of it in
the parts we came from, when we told him it
was believed those great preparations were made
to subdue the Isle of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> he assured us
that if the <HI>English</HI> began there they would fail
of success, that he knew that Country very well,
having lived some time in it, and that this Island
was one of the strongest and most populous of
<HI>America.</HI> That after the year 1586, in which <HI>St.
Domingo</HI> (its Capital City) was sacked by Sir
<HI>Francis Drake,</HI> it was put in such a posture as
could no more apprehend the like misfortune,
and a very fair Citadel raised adjoyining to it,
whose scituation is so advantageous, it seems,
destined to command the neighbouring Sea.
When we came to <HI>Madrid,</HI> I found that those
little Cabals, as well of <HI>Spaniards</HI> as Strangers,
that met a Mornings in the first Court of the Pa∣lace,
usually entertained themselves with the as∣surances
<HI>Cromwel</HI> had given the Spanish Ambas∣sador,
that the Fleet he had sent into the <HI>Indies</HI>
should attempt nothing against his King: that
they therefore made no question but it was to
drive the <HI>French</HI> out of what they possessed in
<HI>New France,</HI> and that it was there he would be∣gin
a Warre against them, and break that Trea∣ty
of Peace from which he had often declined,
<PB N="111" REF="60"/>
and again complied with, the better to amuse
them. But the clear sighted easily judged so con∣siderable
preparations aimed not at so slight a
Conquest. Computing his charge, they found
that all the <HI>French</HI> possessed, whether Islands or
Continent in those quarters was not equivalent
to any considerable part of his expences, and
therefore concluded he had some vaster and
more important design. These men seemed to
me to flatter themselves least, and to be most
reasonable, for I had often heard such as had
negotiated with <HI>Cromwell</HI> say, that if they had
any judgement, they assured themselves they mi∣stook
not in this observation, that he had a par∣ticular
passion for some great Enterprise in the
<HI>Indies.</HI> After he had made all <HI>Europe</HI> admire
and fear his Naval Power by a War against <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
which yet was more glorious than profi∣table
to his Country, it is probable he contri∣ved
how to imploy his arms in some part where
he might reimburss part of his charges. Although
of all his Neighbours he at that time used the
<HI>French</HI> worst; yet it may easily be judged it was
not his interest to come to an entire rupture with
them; because their Traffick for the most part
making use either of <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> Vessels,
he should by that means displease either his own
Merchants, or those with whom he had lately
made peace, besides that the <HI>French</HI> had for some
years been Masters at free-booting against whom
if he sent a Fleet, they would easily avoid it, their
design being only to pillage; so that he should
be at a great charge against them that would al∣wayes
<PB N="112" REF="61"/>
flye from him, and waiting for his Mer∣chants,
oblige him to convoy's; unless he would
lose all the Trade of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and part
of that of the Ocean. <HI>Cromwels</HI> interest there∣fore
requiring a War, and a War by sea, that
may yield him profit proportionable to the great
equipage of Men, Arms, and Ships he is obliged
to maintain, to make himself feared, by which
he hath obtained the Command of both Seas, he
will not attaque <HI>France,</HI> who having all within
her self, waits till Strangers bring home to her
that she can be without, and fetch from her
that which is absolutely necessary to them. For
it hath been observed that her greatest and weal∣thiest
Cities are not scituated near the sea
(though two wash her Coasts) but in the middle
of the Country. By this appears that her Stock
of wealth is within her self, and that (according
to the Polititians rule) she is rather <HI>Vendax</HI> than
<HI>Emax,</HI> selling more than she buys. Her soil
being so rich and fertil, it is no wonder she hath
in all times abandoned the Ocean to be plough'd
by her Neighbours, who employ a great part of
their art and labour to send her as tribute the
fruits of it. To make a war therefore against
<HI>France</HI> with profit, it must most certainly be
done by land; but if we consider the present
condition of <HI>England,</HI> a War of this nature seems
not to agree with it; for we may easily judge
that <HI>Englands</HI> design now aims at no more then
to maintain her self in her present posture, and
to become redoubtable to all the Princes of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
by a power suitable to her scituation, which
<PB N="113" REF="61"/>
hinders their attempting any thing against her,
and obliges them (though against their wills) to
approve what hath passed, by owning her Re∣publick.
To this purpose she resolves to be con∣tinually
potently armed both at home and a∣broad,
one of which puts her in a condition to
concern her self in all the affairs of her Neigh∣bours,
without their interposing in hers, whilst
she is invironed by a prodigious number of in∣vincible
moving Castles, which when she plea∣ses
she joyns for her defence, and causes to fly
for her advantage to what part soever seems
good to her; by the other she thinks securely
to fix her innovated tyranny, in continual dan∣ger
of an insurrection of the people, to restrain
whom her Militia is a curb, as it is lightening to
destroy those that attempt to war upon her. In
fine she can make use of these winged coursers
both near hand and at a distance, and nothing
confining them to her Coasts, where there will
always remain enow; for Guards and Rounds
exact enough to justifie her <HI>Media insuperabilis
unda,</HI> the rest may seek their fortune abroad,
and either wait for the <HI>Indian</HI> Treasures in their
way to <HI>Spain,</HI> or seize them in their mines. But
it is not thus with her land-forces▪ who must
ever be at home to keep up her usurped power,
which will be hazarded by the first shock she re∣ceives
from the many male-contents that have
much ado to suffer her.</P>
<P>A War by land must needs therefore be preju∣dicial
to <HI>England</HI> in the present Conjuncture,
and with <HI>France</HI> destructive, it being the most
<PB N="114" REF="62"/>
potent Nation of Christendom in this age, its
Forces the most united, and that may with the
greatest ease be drawn to any part where there
shall be occasion for them, so that it cannot be
attacqued, but by great and courageous Armies;
of which if this pretended Republick make use,
she must disfurnish her self of her trustiest Com∣manders,
and stoutest Souldiers, which she can∣not
do without danger of losing her new form of
Government. Neither is it very much to the
purpose to say, that for securing it she can make
new Levies, to supply the places of the old ones
she sends abroad; for to an unsettled power,
supported only by the boldness of the Usurpers
that raised it, such a change is very dangerous.
It cannot be denied that <HI>England</HI> uniting with
<HI>Spain</HI> would turn the ballance that way; but be∣sides
that, to do so would be of little advantage
to her, there would be an incounter of the same
inconveniencies. For she must either joyn her
Forces to theirs, and then <HI>France</HI> that is so great
a nursery of Souldiers, having put an end to its
civil warre, minding only that which is forraign,
would not need much to strain it self to oppose
Armies belonging to several Masters, and of di∣vers
interests, which seldom succeed in any thing
they undertake; or else send an Army of her
own, against which <HI>France</HI> would immediately
unite all its power, and be the mean while only
on the defensive against <HI>Spain,</HI> who to make a
thrifty use of such a conjuncture, would move
but slowly and weakly to assist her. However
she might proceed, this is most certain, she
<PB N="115" REF="62"/>
would be constrained to weaken her Land For∣ces,
the only Supporters of that New Repub∣lick.
Should she act only by Sea, and furnish
the Spaniards with Money, to recruit their Ar∣mies,
it hath been already shewed she would
make no advantage by the former, and that a
War attended by such Booty and Conquest as
may countervail the charge and labour is only
proper for her: for the second, it is sufficiently
known that the Treasure of <HI>England</HI> is much ex∣hausted,
and that she owes large sums both to
her Land and Sea Forces; and that to prevent
her over-charging her People, by the great Ex∣pence
she is obliged to, the Gold of <HI>Peru</HI> is
more necessary to her, then to supply from her
own Treasury those that are Masters of it.</P>
<P>During these Discourses, Letters came to
<HI>Madrid</HI> that cleared all Doubts, for after a long
amusing the World with expectation of the Fleet
and the great Treasure it was to bring with it,
and after knowledge that what was on the prin∣cipal
Gallion, which had been wracked, was
for the most part saved, a rumor arose that it
had been met with by the English, who made
no difficulty of attacquing it, but that after a
vigorous defence, in which it sunk two or three
of their Ships, it had retired into the <HI>Havana,</HI>
the Chief City of the Isle of <HI>Cuba.</HI> I know
not whether this particular was true, but am
certain it was written from <HI>Cadis</HI> and <HI>Sevil,</HI> and
from that time believed that <HI>Cromwell</HI> intended
to have his share of the Treasure of the <HI>Indies.</HI>
More to confirm this, the English Merchants
<PB N="116" REF="63"/>
that resided in <HI>Spain,</HI> began to send away, and
as well as they could to conceal their Goods,
fearing a Confiscation in case of Rupture; a lit∣tle
after which it appeared that this Pre-caution
was not useless, for Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> who had pas∣sed
the Spring and part of the Summer in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> returned into the Ocean just at
the time the Gallions were expected. It is said
he desired to careen, which not being permit∣ted,
but on certain conditions, he seemed of∣fended;
and having taken aboard him several
English Merchants with their Consul, put out
to Sea, and scouted about Cape St <HI>Vincent.</HI> It
was then quickly understood that he looked for
the Gallions, with intention to fight them if
they escaped <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables,</HI> who were in the
<HI>Indies;</HI> this caused several Advice Boats to be
dispatched from <HI>Cadis</HI> by Order of the Council
in <HI>Madrid,</HI> to give notice to the Gallions that
they should not leave the Haven they were reti∣red
to, till farther Order: at the same time a re∣solution
was taken to fit up some Ships, partly at
the Kings Charge, and partly at that of the Mer∣chants,
that were concerned to watch the moti∣ons
of this Admiral. Great part of the Traf∣fick
of <HI>Europe</HI> depending on the arrival of the
Gallions, many Ships are ever about <HI>Cadis</HI> at
the time it is expected. Of these and some o∣thers
a Fleet was quickly made ready, and sent
to anchor near <HI>Blake,</HI> yet without hostility, if
the other began not, and only to endeavour
(in case the Gallions had not received the ad∣vice
sent them) to secure them from him. These
<PB N="117" REF="63"/>
two Fleets contemplated one another two or
three moneths without any act of hostility, either
general or particular, and whilest one of them
thus waited for his prey, and the other to secure
it from him, news came that the <HI>Spanesh</HI> Fleet
was advertised of the design against it, and would
not leave the Haven it had retired into without
express order. At the same time also it was said
that <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables</HI> had attacqued <HI>St. Domin∣go,</HI>
but with so bad success, that after loss of
many of their men, they went off for the Island
of <HI>Jamaica</HI> and conquered it.</P>
<P>This proceeding of <HI>Cromwell</HI> changed the dis∣courses
of those that looked on him as one of the
nearest and faithfulled Allies of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had
first of all acknowledged him: For as soon as an
execrable Party of the scum of this Nation, vio∣lating
all Laws divine and humane, had possessed
themselves of its Government, and (by an at∣tempt
so horrible it cannot be paralelled in fore∣going
times, nor scarce mistrusted in the worst
that shall succeed) at one stroke deprived their
King of his Crown and head, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Am∣bassador
received order from <HI>Madrid</HI> to endea∣vour
to make advantage by it, and court the
friendship of that new Republick for his Master,
by giving it in his name all such titles and rights
of a legitimate Power as it should desire: it was
very likely he might succeed in this, there being
probability enough of a league against <HI>France,</HI>
who not only received the exiled Family of the
King of <HI>England,</HI> and refused to own <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
but seised all his Ships, and gave freedom of
<PB N="118" REF="64"/>
his Havens to those that remained faithful to
their King.</P>
<P>The hopes of so advantageous a Treaty in∣creased
in <HI>Madrid,</HI> not only by <HI>Englands</HI> giving
Letters of Reprisal against <HI>France,</HI> and landing
forces hostilely in <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> but by her being so
kind to <HI>Spain,</HI> that she caused her Fleet to take
those ships <HI>France</HI> sent to succour <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be∣sieged
by it. All these fair appearances of Amity
proved insignificant, and the Usurper that governs
in <HI>England,</HI> who seems no less crafty than bold
so well understands the interests of his infant
Republick, that he by degrees accommodates all
to them.</P>
<P>She is Mistriss of many strong and populous
Isies scituated on the passage to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
that are keys to to the Gates that may lay open
a way to so rich a Conquest, by means of
which, she may surprize its treasures as they
pass by, if she will not take the pains to dig
them out of the Mines, of which she may cer∣tainly
make her self Mistriss: she knows that
all the great extent of Land the Spaniards pos∣sessed
there, adheres to their Dominion, more
out of apprehension of their violence, and be∣cause
none hath vigorously attempted to deprive
them of it▪ then by any real power they have
established, capable of preventing this, <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
thus understanding the advantages she hath
towards getting her share of the new world,
with the weakness of those who pretend it
discovered for them alone; it is not strange if
she endeavor to profit by both of them; espe∣cially
<PB N="119" REF="64"/>
in a time, where they which sit at Helme
are obliged to be powerfully armed, and to
employ their many Fleets in some profitable
war, that may make them subsist without the
peoples murmuring at their great charge in en∣tertaining
them: and the Spaniards, as quick
sighted in their politicks, as slow paced in their
enterprizes, very well foresee, that if the French
Negotiations with <HI>Cromwel</HI> effect a peace be∣tween
them, he will pursue his interest, and
forget all advances <HI>Spain</HI> hath made to gain his
friendship, This they think they ought the firm∣lier
to believe, when they remember they could
never get satisfaction for several prizes ta∣ken
by the English, especially, for the money
designed for a whole Campagne which they
sent by sea to <HI>Flanders,</HI> not knowing how to
make it over by Bills of Exchange, by reason
of their difference with <HI>Genoua:</HI> however, that
they might not in so considerable a conjuncture,
be wanting to themselves, and out of conside∣ration
of the advice, <HI>Philip</HI> the II gave his Son
at his death, to be in peace with <HI>England,</HI> that
he might be able to make a war with all the
world; they neglected nothing that might ob∣lige
<HI>Cromwel</HI> to a good understanding with
them. <HI>Alfonso de Cardenas</HI> their Ambassador in
<HI>England,</HI> and who having resided there since
the beginning of the troubles, is looked on as
very able in manageing those affairs, endeavour∣ed
all means of a good understanding, and to
thwart the French Treaty▪ but his politicks be∣ing
apprehended at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to be less under∣taking
<PB N="120" REF="65"/>
then those of <HI>de Bourdeaux</HI> the French
Ambassador; a resolution was taken to send thi∣ther
out of <HI>Flanders</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Leda,</HI> Go∣vernour
of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> as Extraordinary; these
two persons joyned all their adress to bring
<HI>Cromwel</HI> to some friendly composure of dif∣ferences
about the complaints the Spaniards
made against him, and his against them; but
finding no favourable Audience of their many
proposals, the last of these resolved to be gone,
with regret, to have done nothing for his Ma∣sters
service, but to have given him clearer light
of <HI>Cromwels</HI> bad intentions against him: it there∣fore
began to be more publickly discoursed in
<HI>Madrid;</HI> that the many delays in his Negoti∣ation
with <HI>France,</HI> were but tricks to lull the
Spaniard asleep, whilst he sent to attacque his
<HI>Indies;</HI> and that the Treaty which he some∣times
seemed ready to break off, and again to
renew, had been agreed on, and privately sign∣ed
three moneths before. <HI>Spain</HI> now beleeved
<HI>England</HI> intended a breach with her, and though
the passion of the <HI>Castilians,</HI> inveighed sharp∣ly
against the avarice and ambition of <HI>Cromwel,</HI>
which moved him to invade their Treasure;
the moderate sort reasoned otherwise, and in
what was passed, sought the causes of what was
present and to come. But by such discourses, one
could not judge of the whole secret, or entire
cause of the war they apprehended▪ the thoughts
of such as sit at the Helme of Government be∣ing
covered with a cloud of appearances, which
disguise them even to those that have the nearest
<PB N="121" REF="65"/>
prospect; for the most part discovering nothing
but the pretences; their actions being like great
Rivers, of which, though the streams are view∣ed
by all, the heads are invsiible. They yet
at last easily perswaded themselves, that whilst
their King had so many irons in the fire, that
he knew not where to find either Wood or
Coals to heat them, <HI>Cromwel</HI> would make use of
the occasion to attacque him both in the new
and old world, where expecting little resistance,
he needed not doubt of a certain profit, more
considerable to him then the jealousie of the
French progressions or cautions given by the
maxime, <HI>Decreseat Iberus nec crescat Gallus.</HI></P>
<P>On these grounds they concluded, that <HI>Crom∣wel</HI>
fearing a peace between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>
and standing in need of an advantagious war to
justfy his continuing in Arms, would attacque
the weakest, and let the future safety of his estate
giue way to the present necessity, and on that
account agree with <HI>France,</HI> that he might share
in her victories by leaving Land enterprizes to
her, and applying himself to those of the sea,
which better suit with his affairs and the sup∣port
of his power.</P>
<P>But if all this discourse be grounded on con∣jectures,
by which they which are curious in
<HI>Madrid,</HI> seem to divine of the future, and fan∣cy
reasons perhaps very different from the En∣glish
Councils; it is not so where it concerns
what they say of the right the English may
have to attempt the <HI>Indies.</HI> Such amongst
them as are most reasonable and least scrupu∣lous
<PB N="122" REF="66"/>
freely confess, that by the law of nations,
Countreys that have made no Treaty or Com∣pact,
may be assaulted by them that on other
accounts are in peace with those which appropri∣ate
them: So that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> having,
in all Treaties he ever made with the Kings
his neighbors, declared, that whoever goes to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> either to settle or traffick, not be∣ing
natural Spaniards, shall be used as enemies,
cannot complain of such acts of hostility, as are
made by other nations, since himself hath cho∣sen
a perpetual State of war, owning neither
friend nor ally beyond the Line, especially in
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpose the answer of a great <HI>Spanish</HI>
Minister is remarkable, rallying on two healthes
were drank to him, one to his Masters Wife, the o∣ther
to his Mistress: <HI>America</HI> says he, is my Masters
wife, and the <HI>East-Indies</HI> his Mistress; for the later
he is not so jealous as to think himself concern∣in
honor, if any of his friends too freely caress
her; but his Wife he would keep chaste and re∣reserved,
without suffering any to court her.
Questionless when he called <HI>America</HI> his Masters
Wife, he alluded to the Popes Bull, which gave
him power and propriety in this intended Mar∣riage;
but it is generally said that a Rape merits
not such a benediction, since he possesses <HI>Ameri∣ca</HI>
without either her own consent, or that of
her relations, <HI>Europe, Africa,</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>To speak seriously, the Popes donation is a
ridiculous title to those that own not his Au∣thority;
besides, that a great number of those
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>
that do, believe not that it extends to things of
this nature; so that if <HI>Spain</HI> have no other right
than what is derived from <HI>Rome,</HI> she is not well
invested in the possession of the new world, nei∣ther
can they which dispute it against her be ac∣cused
of injustice, since some of them say they
owe him no obedience, and others that he can∣not
dispose of that which belongs not to him.
Nothing then appropriates it to <HI>Spain</HI> but the
first discovery, to have landed Colonies here
and there, to have built Cities and Forteresses,
subdued the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and given names to Ri∣vers
and Havens: But all this cannot have ac∣quired
a possession absolutely general, and with∣out
exception; and since it made its seisure by
the law of such things as are <HI>Nullius &amp; quae fiunt
primi occupantis,</HI> it hath right to no more than
it inhabits, cultivates, and hath entirely con∣quered.
Any Nation may with justice take his
part of the remainder, and <HI>(Spain</HI> going about
to hinder) make use of force, and by force drive
away him that hath settled himself only by
force.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> the second fortified himself by
the Popes Bull, for invading <HI>England,</HI> he added
to that title the most considerable forces that had
ever appeared on the Ocean: What is spiritual
thus stands in need of what is temporal, one of
them well seconding the other, without which
admirable conjunction it is very hard to seise
what belongs to others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Council spared neither wit nor
industry, nor the wealth of the whole Kingdom
<PB N="124" REF="67"/>
for this redoubted Fleet, in which they neg∣lected
not to send fetters to enslave the Inhabi∣tants
of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> but their Forces both
spiritual and temporal had very ill success, and
that prodigious Navy which could hardly be
compleated in two years, was lost in two hours;
part of it the sea swallowed, and the rest fell
into the hands of those it went to subdue, and
of all that proud Armado, scarse any escaped to
carry the sad news into their Country: by which
it is very discernable that Heaven does not al∣wayes
correspond with the visible Head of the
Church. If he disposes of what belongs to the
<HI>Indians,</HI> because Barbarians, one would think
it ought to be restored as they become Christi∣ans;
but their Conversion is to little purpose as
to recovery of their Country; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
very exactly imitate Ecclesiasticks in their ac∣quisitions,
like so many dismembrings of the Pa∣trimonies
of the Laity, from whom whatsoever
is taken returns no more; and if they well keep
what they have once laid hands on, they can as
well cause themselves to be obeyed. Their Em∣pire
is formidable, and he that doubts of this
truth, may be convinced of it in their Cloysters,
where such religious persons as have neither
dignity or parts to set them out, are rather
Slaves than Brothers in Christ to the other. If
within their walls they exercise so absolute a
power, on those which are as it were their fel∣low
prisoners, and make the same profession,
what will they not do to such as are of a diffe∣rent
condition, if they obtain the authority they
<PB N="125" REF="67"/>
desire, and which some of them know so well
how to make advantage of under pretence of
Religion and directing consciences, without fear
of punishment, forsaking the functions of legiti∣mate
Confessors, to creep into Families, and
make themselves arbitrators of their affairs and
interests.</P>
<P>But to return to this Papal Donation, it is ve∣ry
clear, that this imaginary propriety of a world
as yet not well known, and of which probably
not so much is hitherto discovered as we are ig∣norant
of, cannot, nor ought not to hinder o∣ther
people from trafficking there, because it
belongs to the first finder, and that the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
acquired those parts of it they possess, with∣out
any consent of other Nations to enjoy the
propriety and soveraignty of the whole as heirs
of it.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>English</HI> now attacque the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> such as are just acknowledge that
this is not so much to begin as to continue a
War, since they alwayes (more or less) molested
them there, and that no formal Treaty concern∣ing
that Country was ever made with them.
I have heard some very curious persons examine
what good or evil might by it accrue to either
of these Potentates; and they hold that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> would be the first gainers, by an im∣mediate
seising all that belongs to the <HI>English</HI> in
their Dominion. They would find considerable
summs in the hands of Merchants of that Nati∣on,
as well at <HI>Bilbo, Cadis,</HI> and <HI>Sevil,</HI> as in ma∣ny
<PB N="126" REF="68"/>
other of their Port Towns, which might assist
them towards the first charge of the War.</P>
<P>For we may remember that <HI>England</HI> hath
for many years been possessed of all the Trade
of <HI>Spain, Hollanders,</HI> during their War, and the
<HI>French,</HI> since their breach, trafficking only by
her interposal. So that the <HI>English</HI> have establish∣ed
themselves very considerably, and possessed
themselves of much wealth in a Country that a∣bounds
in money, and is poor in Commodities,
and that cannot receive from its Neighbours
what is necessary for it but by their hands.</P>
<P>We cannot oppose against this Confiscation
of the goods of <HI>English</HI> Merchants in all parts of
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Territories, the like to be done to
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> for as they never go
abroad to serve any forrain Prince in his Wars,
they have a Maxim for security of their Com∣merce,
not to exercise it but in Countries where
their King is Master. They go not therefore a∣broad
how great soever their Trade be, but con∣tent
themselves to deal at home with Merchants
Strangers, who for want of correspondence are
forced to settle amongst them, which they do
the more willingly, because having to deal with
people not very well understanding their Com∣modies
they make the greater profit.</P>
<P>We see now the King of <HI>Spain</HI> without danger
of a retaliation of his Subjects▪ when he shall
seise what belongs to those of <HI>England,</HI> inhabi∣ting
here and there in his Dominion: But this
small and inconsiderable advantage, prejudicial
only to private persons, is not to be compared
<PB N="127" REF="68"/>
to that the <HI>English</HI> will obtain, by cruising in both
seas, and attacquing what ever is sent to <HI>Spain</HI>
from its Neighbours, without which it cannot
without difficulty subsist. <HI>Genoua, Naples, Am∣sterdam,</HI>
and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> whose Comerce with it
is so great, will then be able to send little or no∣thing
that shall not run hazard of falling into
their hands; and if they ever make Conquests
in <HI>America,</HI> or take the Plate-fleet (to which it
seems they are forward enough) the <HI>Thames</HI>
will be covered with the spoils of both worlds.</P>
<P>To all these considerations of particular loss
one of State is to be added, which is, that by a
War with <HI>England,</HI> the vast and scattered body
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy will lose its ligaments,
and all communication with its remoter Mem∣bers.
France leaves her little liberty but by
sea, of which this potent Nation, that attributes
to it self the Empire of it will deprive her. It
is true, some object that shift will be made to
open a passage as was done in her War with <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
but others observe great difference be∣tween
those powers, for besides that <HI>England</HI> is
so advantageously scituated, that it can with∣out
difficulty break all correspondence between
<HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Naval Pow∣er
appeared not at its height, till the War was
grown old, and the first animosity decayed, where
as now <HI>Spain</HI> will have to do with a Nation,
that does not raise forces to fight, but fights to
employ those that are already raised. Besides
all which, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was not then so
drained of men and money, as at present, but
<PB N="128" REF="69"/>
could set out considerable Fleets to oppose the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> who making Traffick alone the end
of their Navigation, rather sought for them∣selves
free passage through all seas, then to de∣prive
their enemies of Communication by them;
and this so much, that though they have some∣times
attempted the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleets, and taken
some of them, we may perceive they were not
very greedy of such Conquests, because their
own Merchants were concerned, and received
almost as much prejudice as those of <HI>Cadis</HI> or
<HI>Sevil.</HI> It is well known that at the same time
their ships cruised up and down to interrupt the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Traffick, their Merchants passed and re∣passed
between <HI>Flanders, Genoua,</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> in
favour of it, and carried thither the secretest in∣telligence,
and best ammunition, whereas in a
War with <HI>England</HI> all will go in a more serious
and real manner, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> little caring to
advance his Nations Trade, will vigourously fall
on, and aiming directly at Conquest of the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
endeavor every where to incommode <HI>Spain</HI>
in order to it.</P>
<P>About this time two Books were published in
<HI>Madrid,</HI> which clearly and ingenuously disco∣vered
the great exigencies of the State. This
was admired by such as could not imagine a na∣tural
<HI>Spaniard</HI> would ever own its spirits spent,
and it in a languishing condition. The Author
of the first was one <HI>Don Philippo Antonio Alosa,</HI>
a Knight of the Order of <HI>Calatrava,</HI> of the
Kings Council, and his Secretary in the Coun∣cil
general of the Holy Inquisition. It contained
<PB N="129" REF="69"/>
an Exhortation to Ecclesiasticks to supply the
King by voluntary Contributions, in the so very
pressing necessity of his Kingdom; of which
having first declared the Causes, which he deri∣ved
from the time when <HI>Philip</HI> the Second en∣gaged
almost all his Revenues, for aiding the
French League and building the Escurial, and
represented how under <HI>Philip</HI> the Third his Son,
occasions of expence augmented, by reason of
the Wars of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> removal of the
Court from <HI>Valladolid</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> with his
great Charges in entertaining the Princes of
<HI>Savoy,</HI> and Reception of the English and
French Ambassadors; and that which compleat∣ed
the ruin of the State, and drew on it the ex∣tremest
misery, the raising the value of Copper
Money, by which <HI>Sajavedra</HI> says more mis∣chief
happened to <HI>Spain,</HI> than if all the Serpents
and Monsters of <HI>Africk</HI> had attacked it: he
makes out, that the present King at his Succes∣sion
received the Crown so poor, it was admira∣ble
there could be found wherewithal to resist
so many Enemies as at once proclaimed War a∣gainst
it; and concludes, that after the many
shocks it hath sustained, it will hardly any long∣er
prove able to defend it self, without recourse
to some sudden supply, though it be useless to
fancy New Imposts, or augmentation of the
old ones, there being a general incapacity in the
subjects to pay what is already laid upon them.
This pre-supposed, he continues that applications
ought to be made to the Clergy only, who have
ever kept their doors open to all manner of
<PB N="130" REF="70"/>
acquisitions, and closely shut against the least
alienation, and who with little or no expence
possess the greatest wealth of the Kingdom, till
a more learned Pen make evident, they may just∣ly
be compelled to contribute to the Kings ur∣gent
occasio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he declares his design to be no
more but to oblige them to a voluntary loane,
which he shews will be to their advantage; be∣cause
if the Kings necessities force him to press
the Laity with rigor, they will abandon Tillage
and the Country, in such manner, that Ecclesi∣astical
Rents, deduced only from the hands of
the other by Tythes, and the like, will fail.</P>
<P>Going on he adds that such a liberality is
more especially due to the most Catholick King,
who aims only at the Churches good, and re∣quires
assistance for continuing the War only in
order to an advantageous Peace, neither does
he demand any thing that he first gave not, all
of them having received their benefices and dig∣nities
from his Majesty as their Patron: That
they need only spare part of their Plate, Jewels,
and rich Moveables, abating something of their
great Trains, entertained questionlesly by them,
shew that grandeur, they will more handsomly
make appear by assisting their King: afterwards
he sayes that to give this greater efficacy, the
King may please to make choice of one of his
great Ministers of State, to whom the Clergy
have some kind of obligation on account of
their preferments, and from whom they may
reasonably expect more, by his report to the
King and Council of their forwardness and libe∣rality:
<PB N="131" REF="70"/>
he advises farther, that addresses be not
made to the Body or Convocation, but to par∣ticulars,
and an exact register kept of the wil∣lingest,
which will on all occasions be useful to
them, towards acquiring greater favors. By
this method, which is nothing else but a Collecti∣on
of State, he supposes the King may amass a
considerable sum towards paying his Troops,
that perish for want, and re-establishing his Af∣fairs,
which the same necessity hath so much
disordered.</P>
<P>The Second Book was a Memorial drawn up
by a certain Captain called <HI>Joseph Puteol,</HI> in
which he represented to the King, that by
easing his people he would be the better en∣abled
to make War, <HI>Como assistiendo à to∣dos
se pue da lograr el hazer mejor la Guerra.</HI></P>
<P>The Expedients he propounded, spoke him
a man of parts to such as knew him not, but in
others prejudice, raised a contempt of his rea∣sons
because he was not in an eminent condition;
as if the validity of a medicine depended on the
quality of the Physitian, <HI>&amp; aliquando etiam
Olitor commode potest esse locutus, &amp;c.</HI> but passing
by these, I will here recount what the former
look on as most judicious in his Book, which will
also very much tend to the better understanding
the condition in which I shall leave <HI>Spain.</HI> Af∣ter
particulars of all the Revenues his King draws
from his Kingdoms of <HI>Castille</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI>
(which in gross amount to no more than Eigh∣teen
Millions of Gold, and of which <HI>Philip</HI> the
Fourth when he came to the Crown found but
<PB N="132" REF="71"/>
Eight Millions two hundred seventy four thou∣sand
Crowns without incumbrances, which to
supply his Wars against <HI>France,</HI> he was imme∣diately
necessitated to engage, and afterwards
to alienate, (for reducing <HI>Catalonia,</HI> appeasing
the troubles of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> defence of
the Dutchy of <HI>Millain,</HI> recovery of <HI>Portolon∣gone</HI>
and <HI>Piombino,</HI> and many Towns in <HI>Flan∣ders;</HI>
besides assisting such Princes as had sided
with him in the French revolutions:) he con∣cludes
a very exact and parcimonious oeconomy
for the future to be the only means of replenish∣ing
the Kings Coffers.</P>
<P>The wayes he proposes for this, seem so ma∣ny
remarques of the former ill dispensation and
administration of the Publick Treasure.</P>
<P>In the first place he sayes, That what is neces∣sary
to the subsistance of their Armies, fails of
being supplied, not only by reason of the En∣gagement
of the principal Revenues of the
Crown to such as have furnished the King in
his necessities, but no less by the prodigious
cheats of an infinite number of Officers employ∣ed
towards their recovery; which gave the King
just cause to complain to the <HI>Cortes,</HI> That of Ten
Millions paid yearly by <HI>Castille,</HI> six stuck to the
fingers of Under Treasurers, Secretaries, Recei∣vers,
Tellers, and other Exchequer men, that
subsist only by Rapines exercised on the King and
his People.</P>
<P>Then he desires that difference be made be∣tween
Monopolists and Farmers of Customs,
as well old as new, and that such of them as
<PB N="133" REF="71"/>
have dealt franckly, without making malicious
advantage of the necessity of affairs, may be di∣stinguished
from those that have thriven by
craft and design, in purchasing or renting the
Kings Duties. With the first he holds it but rea∣sonable
to make a fair composition, and after∣wards
that they be permitted the enjoyment of
what they acquired with so great equity: the
other he would have treated with all possible
severity, and compelled to refund with no less
rigor than Sorcerers are burnt and Theeves
hanged. For what concerns rewards, he allows
it just to recompence all such as have done the
Crown service, be its necessities never so great;
but even for this he would not have the King
draw any thing from his own Purse, nor pre∣tend
to liberality at a time when he hath not
wherewithal; he therefore advises (since high
birth is not ever the source of eminent actions,
neither do Children alwayes inherit the Pru∣dence
and Vertue of their Parents) not to con∣tinue
in the same Families, 49<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commanderies,
which the Eight Orders of Spanish Knighthood
possess, worth above a Million of Gold yearly;
but instead of bestowing them out of favour for
the most part to persons unworthy and useless,
hereafter to distribute them to such as either
have preserved or extended the Limits of his
Monarchy, or at least by an Honourable Profes∣sion
of Arms are in a capacity to do it. And if
he ever suffers any of them to be diverted from
the advantage of Soldiers, to whom only they
of right appertain, that it be to some able States∣man
<PB N="134" REF="72"/>
or Dextrous Ambassador, who without
drawing Sword, hath saved some Town or
Countrey, surprized an Enemy, broken in Pie∣ces
his Levies, cut off Ammunition and Victual
from his Armies, drawn in Neighboring Prin∣ces
to unite against him, obliged some of them
to quit a Neutrality, succored some Ally, or con∣firmed
some other that wavered; in a word, to
such a person whose industry and prudence hath
been highly advantageous to his King and Coun∣trey.
He no less complains, that instead of gi∣ving
what is substantial in these Orders to Per∣sons
of Merit, the very Badges of them, which
are only superficial, are for the most part refu∣sed.
He instances in Mr <HI>de St Maurice,</HI> a Gen∣tleman
of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> who after very good ser∣vice,
pretended several years without obtaining
this, though Marquis <HI>Caracene</HI> writ in his fa∣vour,
and attested his Valour and eminent Me∣rit.
This takes away his admiration, that in
all the Troops that serve in the Dutchy of <HI>Mil∣lain,</HI>
there are but Eight Knights that have this
honour, the peculiar recompence of Soldiers, be∣ing
frequently bestowed on Pen-men, or such as
depend more on the Gown than Sword, though
they wear the later, as a Mark of what they
ought to be, rather than of what they really
are. After this detection of abuses in manage∣ing
his Kings Treasure, he passes to the wayes of
increasing and better securing it. Towards in∣creasing
it, he would have taken into conside∣ration
that <HI>Spain</HI> is inhabited by some persons
that are very rich, others indifferently so, the
<PB N="135" REF="72"/>
rest very poor, which is the greatest number,
and that in raising Contributions neither of these
three can be favoured, without prejudice not
only of the other two, but of the Soveraign
himself: Such a Geometrical proportion is
therefore to be observed, as considers the means
and faculties of each, and prevents that incon∣venience
in the State that often afflicts our Bo∣dies,
when all the ill humors fall on the part
that is weakest. After so good a Foundation, he
attacks those that possess most and pay least,
and makes appear that the Spanish Clergy, being
very wealthy, pays the King but Four hundred
forty seven thousand Crowns, a trifle compared
to its ability, and concludes that an augmenta∣tion
of the Kings Revenue might in so pressing a
necessity be charged on it with all justice and
reason imaginable. He thinks it not fit to impose
more on the Nobility and Gentry, who ought to
be in a continual posture to do the King personal
service, but upon Citizens and Farmers, and
concealed Treasure for the greatest part in the
hands of Persons faulty or disaffected, and that
this might bring up a considerable aid, were the
sources of their abundance well examined. For
such Taxes as are settled ill, he says that which
is imposed on the Eighth part of Flesh, Oil, and
Wine, is the worst of all others, giving occa∣sion
to a thousand cheats, as well by the Offi∣cers,
as by such as endeavour to bring those
provisions into <HI>Madrid</HI> and other Towns with∣out
paying Duties. To which I can adde, that
I have been assured, an infinite number live
<PB N="136" REF="73"/>
only by that imployment, in so much that not
only some poor Gentlemen and Ranting Hectors
that will live on nothing, and without doing
any thing, with whom Courts and great Cities
ever abound, concern themselves in it; but e∣ven
Churchmen and the greatest Noblemen, that
are weakly revenued. For this cause Guards
have been appointed to attend the Collection
of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mposts, on condition that what they
can seise of Goods that have entered without
paying Duties, shall be their own. But this
which was established, to redouble their dili∣gence,
they have turned into small Politicks,
that causing them to consider the Kings interest,
if vigorously pursued, as that which would put
an end to their profits, they are not very exact,
perceiving that should they not sometimes con∣nive,
they which busie themselves in stealing
Customs, would give over the Trade, finding
no effect but Confiscation of their Goods, after
which the Kings Duties would be well paid, but
they get nothing. They therefore correspond
with them, and seise not their Goods, till so
much hath entered, as will make them more
than savers. This Confederacy against the
King, is maintained at his Charge, and drones
suck the blood of the poor people, the effects
of so great a disorder falling on their heads. A∣mongst
other Impositions he thinks ill laid, and
which I will not give my self the trouble of reci∣ting▪
he mentions Seal'd Paper, and says it is a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery incertain Revenue, because founded on
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw Suits, to which the folly and obstinacy of
<PB N="137" REF="73"/>
humane nature alone gives being; it is true that
in <HI>England,</HI> madder in this particular than <HI>Spain</HI>
or any other part of the World, more profit
might be derived from this, than in a Countrey
where that infamous imployment is not so much
in request; whereas in <HI>England</HI> it is exercised
with such avarice, rapine, and so prodigious
delays, that this horrible Pestilence which feeds
it self fat by means of infinite numbers of vile In∣sects,
Attorneys, Solicitors, Attorneys Lieutenants
and Sub-solicitors, it must needs pass for one of
the heaviest scourges of the Nation, and plagues
of its best Families.</P>
<P>To conclude, he implores his King to cast off
all those ill designed Impositions, that will be
destructive both to him and his Subjects, and to
lay the burthen more equally, which will make
it light, and his people bear it chearfully, when
free from Vexations, that tend more to the
advantage of Pettifoggers, than of his Re∣venue.</P>
<P>If what he proposes may be endeavored, he
doubts not but his King will vanquish all his
Enemies, there being already so many Victo∣ries
that testifie his Valour, and so many Books
that publish his Prudence, besides so much Gold
and Silver stamped with his Effigies, currant
thorow the World, though <HI>Spain</HI> admits none
that is Foreign; an invincible demonstration of
its inexhaustible Treasure.</P>
<P>Whilst these two Books were Subjects of our
Discourse, by reason of their surprizing Novel∣ty,
the Genius of that Nation considered, which
<PB N="138" REF="74"/>
seldom discovers where the Shoo wrings it, and
whose constancy is so admirable, it alwayes sets
a good face on an ill game; we received Letters
for some of the Principal Ministers of the Catho∣lick
King: had they come to us at our first arri∣val
at <HI>Madrid,</HI> they would have introduced us
to a nearer speculation of that Court, but arri∣ving
in <HI>June,</HI> and we being resolved, for avoid∣ing
the great heats, to repass the <HI>Pyreneans</HI> be∣fore
they began, we had but little time to con∣tinue
in a Countrey, where the Sun is something
too prodigal of his beams. To make use there∣fore
of all advantages possible, and that accord∣ing
to Formalities, which are here essential, I
addressed my self to Don <HI>Martin</HI> Secretary of
the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda,</HI> desiring him to give his
Lord the Letter of Recommendation we had for
him. I acquainted him with the qualities of
my Lord <HI>B.</HI> and <HI>A.</HI> and inquired at what hour
we might have access, least we should apply our
selves to him when he gave not Audience. Such
precautions are necessarily to be observed in this
Court, by all Strangers, who without any to
introduce them, desire to be particularly admitted
to a Principal Minister of State: by means of which
they escape being exposed to that dry gravity
which receives Strangers with a leaden austere
Fore head, close and reserved, all such whom they
apprehend they may mistake in its Civilities, for
want of knowledge of their quality; besides that,
generally speaking, such as understand the World,
ought never themselves to deliver such Letters,
which serve only to make them known to those
<PB N="139" REF="74"/>
they never saw before; for if they be read in their
presence, they suffer some time of vexatious incivi∣lity,
and if the reading them be deferred till after
their departure; at the first Visit they have but a
cold Reception, the Complements faint and con∣fused,
directed more to him that sent the Letter,
then to those that bring it, and for whose sake it
was written. This we avoided, for the Earl ha∣ving
been informed, as well by the Letter of Dom
<HI>Estevan de Gamarra,</HI> as report of his Secretary,
who we were, received us as well as we could
wish: And to speak truth of him, none in this
Court understands Civility and the World bet∣ter.
His first presenting himself is graceful and
winning, and makes appear, that with the seve∣rity
of his Countries Customs and imperious gra∣vity
of his Nation, he hath mixed a certain fo∣rain
air, that takes off from the austerity, and
makes him so agreeable, that if the Address
and Gallantry of the first of the <HI>Tarquins</HI> cau∣sed
it to be said, <HI>Graecum ingenium miscuerat I∣talicis
artibus,</HI> he had added the Complacency
of <HI>Greece</HI> to the Arts of <HI>Italy.</HI> We may con∣clude
that those of this great man make evident,
<HI>Hispanicum supercilium potest moribus exteris &amp;
comitate exotica dilui.</HI> That Spanish severity
may be moderated by forain Civility. His Wit
and Judgement appeared in his Embassy as
Plenipotentiary to <HI>Munster;</HI> and when News
came to <HI>Madrid</HI> of the promotion of Cardi∣nal
<HI>Chigi</HI> to the Pontifical Chair, and the
great desire he expressed for Peace between
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> this man was spoken of
<PB N="140" REF="75"/>
to be sent to <HI>Rome</HI> with the Embassy of
Obedience: though indeed he was chiefly
designed to that Employment, because it was
hoped that by reason of the great friendship
he had contracted with the new Pope when
he was <HI>Nuncio</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> he might do his
Master good service in all manner of Negotia∣tions.
Many advantages are also reported to
have been offered on behalf of the King to ob∣lige
him to accept this, besides a considerable
sum of ready money, particularly Three thou∣sand
Ducats a Moneth, his Son to be made an
Earl, and himself continued President of the
Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that the Golden Key
he carried only as a Badge of Honour, should
be conferred <HI>à Exercicio,</HI> that is to be made use
of, with all Priviledges belonging to it: but no∣thing
of this is yet effected, and they which un∣derstand
the confidence of Don <HI>Lewis de Haro</HI>
in his fidelity and capacity, assure he will not re∣move
him from the Council where he is now
President, till needs must. Having thus recei∣ved
all manner of satisfaction in our first Visit,
to so accomplished a Person, who omitted no∣thing
that might assure my Lord <HI>B.</HI> of the esteem
he had for his quality and merit, at the very first
sight remarkable to him by that vivacity which
is so natural to Extraordinary Persons, they
need not speak twice to those to whom they
would make themselves known: We thought
our selves very forward on our way, to obtain
the like from Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI> when we
should wait on him: For besides the Letter we
<PB N="141" REF="75"/>
had for him, we doubted not but the Earl would
acquaint him with the Visit we had made him▪
and with all that could oblige him to receive us
well. Besides our Letter for Don <HI>Lewis de Ha∣ro,</HI>
we had another for a Gentleman called <HI>A∣lonzo
Vercoca,</HI> Cosin to Dom <HI>Stephen de Gamar∣ra</HI>
the Catholick Kings Ambassador in <HI>Holland,</HI>
who, we were assured was very well with this Fa∣vorite.
We therefore thought best first of all
to visit Seignior <HI>Alonzo,</HI> that he might deliver
our Letter, and present us when it should be
seasonable. We were not a little troubled in in∣quiring
after his Loding, but at last learned that
he was usually resident in the Countrey, and only
a Son of his who was one of Don <HI>Lewis de Ha∣ro</HI>'s
Gentleman lived in <HI>Madrid.</HI> Enquiring
for him at the Palace of this Chief Minister▪ I
was told he had a Chamber in the Town, and
came not thither whilest his Master was with
the King at <HI>Buen Retiro;</HI> the Civility of the Of∣ficers
of whom I enquired his Lodging, extend∣ed
not so far as to send some body to shew it me,
and he being seldom at home, I was either to
seek him very early in the Morning or late in
the Evening. At last I found him just out of
Bed, no less troubled how to enquire after us,
because he had received a Letter from the Am∣bassador
to his Father, by which he reiterated
his request for doing us all manner of good Of∣fices
in that Court. Some dayes passed, in
which he neither visited us nor returned any an∣swer.
This made me imagine that eithet he did
not much value the Ambassadors Letter, or else
<PB N="142" REF="76"/>
had not sufficient access to his Master to perform
what was recommended to him.</P>
<P>As soon as we thought of leaving <HI>Spain,</HI>
I began to consider how we might obtain
an authentick passport, being sufficiently
informed of the insolence and impudence on
the passes called <HI>Puertos,</HI> as well by the Farmers
of the Customs as such as are there in guard. On
which account many formalities are necessary
to be observed in the Passes, that they may be
effectual enough to check the importunity and
knavery of those Harpies that lie in expectati∣on
of travailers, especially strangers, to put all
imaginable affronts upon them.</P>
<P>I made very solicitous enquiry of all circum∣spections
necessary, and the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI>
having told my Lord <HI>B.</HI> that not to leave <HI>Spain</HI>
without carrying along one of its greatest rari∣ties,
he should do well to take some horses;
to which purpose he would provide him all suffi∣cient
passports; we did not in the least distrust, ob∣taining
them as advantagious as we could wish:
they which have no friends in Court, are obliged
to petition a certain Council, whose Secretary is
called <HI>Carnero:</HI> the petition considered on, if
the Pass be granted, the Result goes from thence
to the Kings Council, from whence it is return∣ed
sometimes confirmed, sometimes annulled,
and often limited or amplified, according to the
petitioners success in his solicitations. In∣deed,
though either by favour or bribe,
authentick Passports are sometimes obtained,
and that without delay; such as are unknown
<PB N="143" REF="76"/>
and unfriended, find this trifle become a trou∣blesome
and tedious negotiation. Ours was not
so, for having drawn up a very exact memo∣rial,
and according to the sense of those that
understand the form of a Passport, to go out
of <HI>Spain</HI> without lett or molestations: I carried
it to Don <HI>Martin,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI>'s Se∣cretary:
he read it, and told me so many par∣ticulars
were not necessary; and that our Pass∣port
being to come immediately from the Kings
Council, there needed no more but to translate
into Spanish, that we had brought from the
Arch-Duke; the like whereof, which would be
every where respected, should be dispatched
us; I acquiesced in this, and went with him to
<HI>Geronimo de la Torre,</HI> one of the Secretaries of
State, to whom he delivered a Memorial for
the said Passport, recommending it to him in
the name of his Master; he promised to carry
it to the Council of State that very day, using
us with great civility, and accompanying us
to the bottom of his stairs.</P>
<P>Our Passport being in this forwardness, Mr.
<HI>B.</HI> and I, went one morning to visit Segnior
<HI>Versosa,</HI> by it the better to understand the nati∣ons
humour, and whether negligence or want
of credit had caused his failing in what the Am∣bassador
desired of him: he instantly excused
his not having waited on us, and told us he had
delivered the Letter to Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI> who
had commanded him to accompany us to Au∣dience
(such is the manner of speaking in this
Court) which he would give us the next day.
<PB N="144" REF="77"/>
This discovered that his slowness in returning us
answer, was rather an effect of the humor of
his nation, (not very punctual nor forward in
its civilities, no more then in its affairs) then of
his negligence or little power to perform what
had bin recommended to him; being a kin to
the Secretary <HI>Geronimo de la Torre,</HI> who had re∣ceived
our Memorial, he would needs go along
with us to him, and recommend it in our pre∣sence;
but I was strangely surprized to see this
man in this visit we made in company of his kins∣man,
so different from what I had before found
him; for instead of our former civil reception of
which I spoke but now, he would scarcely move
from his Table and Papers, entertaining us with
interrupted sentences, whilst he ranged the wri∣tings
he held in his hand. I was scandalized at
such an inequality, and the favourablest judge∣ment
I could make, was (whilst I considered
him to be of that nation which is esteemed so
unvariable in its humor and actions) that his
thoughts were that day entirely possessed by
something very important and vexatious. This
prevented not our repairing next morning ac∣cording
to our appointment to visit the chief
Minister of so superbe a Court. He is not
difficult of access, nor environed with the pomp
and splendor usually affected by such as pos∣sess
the place next their Master: he is not court∣ed,
nor his withdrawing room crouded with any
that have not business with him; none are re∣fused
admittance, but every man in his turn
brought into his chamber, where having spo∣ken,
<PB N="145" REF="77"/>
he retires and gives place to others▪ To
such as are not admitted, if they have former∣ly
moved him in their concerns; he signifies his
pleasure by his Secretary, which (if they have
nothing new to offer) must of force content
them; such as have never opened their affair,
or have any thing to add, are referred to the
next day or another hour: so that few go a∣way
without some kind of satisfaction or hopes to
receive it, at least, in obtaining Audience. In other
places, Favourites or chief Ministers seldom are
accessible, and never till after many refufals; and
not content to participate of the Soveraigns au∣thority,
pretend to a degree of adoration above
it: and we may assure our selves, that though this
quality occasions in most of these, pride, vanity,
and pleasure; it gives Don <HI>Lewis</HI> (as he makes
use of it) trouble alone, and that amongst all
that are in publick employment he is not only
first in rank, but in attachment and subjection
to the service of his King; to which, to speak
the truth, he intirely resigns himself: for in the
morning immediately after his devotions, and
visit of the Kings apartment, about Seven a
clock he sits down in his chamber of dispatch∣es,
where he continues till one; giving order to
his Secretaries in all that is to be done, and
hearing such as are to speak with him, pre∣ented
by order as hath already bin said: after din∣sner
he reposes, or retires some hours; and about
four or five, returns to the same chamber, and
like imployment till seven. Two days in the
week he, as well as the King, gives publick Au∣dience;
<PB N="146" REF="78"/>
then all enter, and I have seen there of
all qualities, even lame and naked soldiers, who
amongst others present themselves and preten∣ces,
without any other difference, then obliging
them to advance with discretion and respect, if
perhaps they observe it not.</P>
<P>To all this is to be added, his care of the
Court, he being Master of the Horse, with his
hours at both Councils of State and Privy, be∣sides
Audiences of ceremony, and affairs of Am∣bassadors,
and Agents of forreign Princes; so
that I can imagine no life more agitated nor
busied then his. I shall say nothing of his parts,
which the Spaniards hold not equal to those of
his predecessor; the other having bin quick and
active in the most eminent degree; but they
add that they were not therefore more succes∣ful,
either in publick or particular; and that
the great moderation and good nature of this
man, is equivalent to the heat and zeal of the
former, who to attain his ends, suffered none to
enjoy quiet: so true is that of the Politians,
that the greatest intellects are not most proper
to govern States and Kingdoms; and that they
look so far before them, they often stumble in
such a manner as casts them into extremities,
from whence all their dexterity hath much ado
to free them, and the height of their good for∣tune
to secure them from ruine; whereas the
middle sort by moving softly are not subject to
those politick transports, which often toss interest
of State into the air with the sublimest maximes
of him that governs.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="78"/>
As soon as we came to <HI>Don Lewis</HI> his lodging,
which was then at the Hermitage of <HI>Buen retiro,</HI>
we were received by Don <HI>Christopher</HI> his Secre∣tary.
He is a little man, of address and subtilty
beyond what is usual in his nation, being a Ger∣man,
of which Countrey he hath so little the
meen and presence, one would rather take him
to have been born at the foot of the <HI>Apennine</HI>
or <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> then on the banks of <HI>Rhine</HI> or
<HI>Danube.</HI> He takes care of all forreign affairs,
and serves his master as interpreter; we were
immediately presented to him, and thus he re∣ceived
us: He sate in a Chair at the end of a Ta∣ble,
with his Cloak on his shoulders, and his
sword by his side; he rose up at our entrance,
and after we had saluted him, caused seats to be
presented us; and immediately <HI>Don Christopher</HI>
placed himself on his knees, on the Carpet that
was between his Chair, and that of my Lord <HI>B.</HI>
who having spoken, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> answered by in∣terpretation
of Don <HI>Christopher,</HI> as obligingly as
was possible. After the first compliments, he en∣quired
after our journey, and continuance at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and finding us inclined to leave it, ask∣ed,
if we would not pass by <HI>Sevil;</HI> and we ex∣cusing
our selves, by reason the Summer was so
far advanced; he replyed, our time indeed
pressed us, if we desired to be out of <HI>Spain</HI> be∣fore
the great heats; but not visiting <HI>Andalusia,</HI>
we lost the sight of the pleasantest Countrey in
the world; he afterwards made us many offers
of service, and when we acquainted him that
we desired to pass through <HI>Arragon,</HI> and, if pos∣sible,
<PB N="148" REF="79"/>
enter <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Catalonia;</HI> he promised
us two Letters of recommendation; one to the
Duke of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Arragon,</HI> the
other for Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Austria.</HI> He asked us if
we would kiss the Kings hands; but our time
for leaving the Countrey being so near, we
thought it unnecessary to give him the trouble
of obtaining that honour for us, having so of∣ten
seen his Majesty. In a word, he omitted no∣thing
that was obliging, or might render our
visit satisfactory; he is indeed of a humour to
discontent no body, and never favorite did less
hurt: he suffers to live at Court, not only such
as envy him, but his professed enemies, as the
Duke <HI>de Medina de los Torres,</HI> and goes abroad
with so small pomp, that his Train little or no∣thing
exceeds the meanest Grand of <HI>Spain:</HI>
he is not crouded after, but observed to follow
much better then his predecessor, the advice of
a favourite of the same nation, who after his fall
admonished all of the like condition, themselves
to put a spoke in the wheel of fortune, when by
too great an elevation she almost equalized them
to the King, adding, that he which thinks him∣self
advanced highest, is often nearest his ruine,
and therefore ought never to be transported to
receive such honours and attendances, as his
fall cannot deprive him of, without shame; on
occasion of which I must needs mention, what
was reported to me to have been spoken by a
great Statesman of this Court: <HI>That a Favo∣rite
ought to have the moderation and prudence of
that Angel before whom St</HI> John <HI>prostrated him∣self
<PB N="149" REF="79"/>
with adoration,</HI> and refuse some kind of re∣spects
that may be rendred him with a <HI>Vide ne
feceris, conservus tuus sum:</HI> for if God in that
immensity of glory and power he possesses to
reduce the universe to nothing, admits no com∣panion
in his adorations: Kings whose Autho∣rity
is limited, and whose Might only weakly
imitates that which is infinite, will much less
endure it. Such boundless ambition, and exces∣sive
thirst of grandeur, in two years time strange∣ly
shook Cardinal <HI>Spinola,</HI> one of the greatest
Favorites of <HI>Philip</HI> the II. and at last overthrew
that famous Conde Duke <HI>Olivares,</HI> whose place
is at present possessed by Don <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P>Besides what I have touched concerning his
Ministry, the curious find a considerable diffe∣rence
between the favors of the Uncle and Ne∣phew,
as well in the foundation as manage∣ments
of them; they consider that of the for∣mer
was derived from his conformity of man∣ners
(real or affected) with those of his King;
and from the care he took to second his incli∣nations,
and make himself a necessary in∣strument
of his satisfaction in pleasures, perhaps
contrary to his greatness and condition: but that
of the second had its source from the Kings ob∣ligations
to him, for services rendred him in en∣counters
where his Life and Crown were con∣cerned:
that the first had his good will and
affection, which are but as blossoms that a thou∣sand
accidents blow away, whilst the other is
established in the intellect, having been fixed
there by experience, the true and only root of
<PB N="150" REF="80"/>
favour, proof against time and humor; that the
first arrived at so eminent a degree almost at the
same time and the same manner as the Duke of
<HI>Luines</HI> rose near <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII of <HI>France,</HI>
and the later by a way very like that ascended
by Cardinal <HI>Richlieu:</HI> the Nephew had time to
make use of the faults and misfortunes of the
Uncle, as well as the Cardinal of the failings of
his Predecessor. But for what concerns the ex∣ercise
of his authority, they observe it is very
different from the other three. The Duke <HI>de
Luines,</HI> and the Conde Duke <HI>Olivares</HI> disturbed
the quiet of their Masters Dominions; the first,
that he might make use of the sword of Con∣stable
he had newly received, and the other to
make ostentation of the vast capacity he pre∣tended
to above all mankind. <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who
succeeded the first of these, though with very
different maximes, thought nevertheless he was
to continue the war he found begun, to gain
him reputation, and remove all obstacles that
might prevent such a one as was more the in∣terest
of <HI>France,</HI> and would give him oppor∣tunity
of entring the Lists with that ambitious
Conde Duke. Don <HI>Lewis</HI> was no sooner infa∣vour,
and entred on business, but he endeavour∣ed
to make understood, that the whole world
and especially the house of <HI>Austria,</HI> suffered by
emulation of those two Ministers. He well fore∣saw
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the condition of the Spanish Monarchy,
attacqued in Trunck and Branch, considered)
that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peace, (the least dishonourable that could
be obtained) was necessary to prevent final de∣struction.
<PB N="151" REF="80"/>
It is said, he effectually represent∣ed
to the King and his Council the faults of his
predecessor, and made it appear, that the uni∣versal
desire of all the lesser Potentates of
<HI>Europe,</HI> who wish equality amongst the great∣est,
as ballances where every one may find his
counterpoise is very suitable both to the inclina∣tions
and interests of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain▪</HI> though
not often so to the ambition of their Kings,
and vanity of the Ministers that serve them;
and that which soever of them gains upon the
other, would acquire most enemies, were not
<HI>Europe</HI> by artifice of their Favorites (who set
their Masters together by the ears to make osten∣tation
of their own address during the combat,
as Pilots their skill in the height of a tempest)
divided into Leagues, and almost all of it in
arms in favor of one or other of these Crowns▪
that whilst war continued, the allies of <HI>France</HI>
would never forsake her to become Neuters,
or turn their swords against her, but that in the
mean time the dangers into which they preci∣pitated
themselves, were to be represented to
them, with a great inclination to peace, even
so far, as to purchase it at what price soever.
That experience in all ages had made evident,
they recovered by Treaties what they had lost
that by wars. That in <HI>Germany</HI> even they were to
be incited to cry up peace that were confederates
with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> to oblige them to which,
they should have intimation, that nothing was
taken into greater consideration, then their sa∣tisfaction;
and that it was high time to divert
<PB N="152" REF="81"/>
the jealousie of their liberty against two forraign
Potenthtes, more ready to invade it, then ever
the Emperor was to impose fetters upon it. That
in <HI>Italy, Flanders,</HI> and all other parts where
there were Leagues against <HI>France,</HI> the like was
to be done; and at the general Treaty of peace,
all desirable conditions given to their weakest
enemies, to enfeeble the more potent by depri∣ving
them of the others assistance. Thus the
beginning of his Ministry, (if what hath been
informed me, and I have here represented be
true) was not to cry up war in his Masters ears,
out of consideration only, of what might augment
his own power, as is done by such Epicures of
favor as turn it to their particular advantage:
He would neither seem idolatrous in his poli∣ticks,
by giving no council but such as was to
his Masters advantage; nor Atheistical in valuing
nothing but the good of the people, but with
respect to both of them, shewed himself a good
Statesman▪ dealing with them like Husband and
Wife, and concluding that for their living hap∣pily
together, they should admit no friend that
might separate their interests. I had bin made
acquainted with some of these particulars be∣fore
I visited Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> and could set down
more, were not a great part of the remarques
as well effaced from my Tablebook, as vanish∣ed
from my memory: if it be expected, I say
something of his person; I must add, it is suffici∣ently
taking, and that I was told, his wit was
neither of the finest or grossest temper, not ex∣travagantly
high, nor insipidly low; his coun∣tenance
<PB N="153" REF="81"/>
neither very airy nor excessively seri∣ous.
Nothi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be discovered in his eyes, ei∣ther
too he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> or too light, his make and po∣sture
of body is neither eminently heroick nor
contemptibly vulgar, <HI>Ʋt staturae &amp; oris non est
plus quam Heroici, ita nihil in eo quod nimium
vulgare sit.</HI> And he is looked upon to be no
ways incommodious, either to Prince or Peo∣ple;
and as he charms not the first by extraor∣dinary
endowments either of mind or body;
neither does he disgust the later. And a Spani∣ard
one day told me, <HI>En el semblante mismo este
privado no enfada por lo atrevido, in desluce por l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
disanimodo:</HI> to which I will give no other Eng∣lish,
but, the meen of this favorite is neither in∣solent
nor abject.</P>
<P>The great revolutions in the affairs of this
Monarchy since Don <HI>Lewis</HI> had the managing
of them, present me a vast field to expatiate on
what seems vigorous or weak in his conduct;
for some particulars are observable, in which,
nothing more could be wished then what he
did, and others as discernable, in which he
seems not to have made use of all advantages
that presented themselves. The peace conclu∣ded
at <HI>Munster</HI> with the Hollanders, is thought
a masterpiece, they having received as an eter∣nal
maxime, never to have it with his King;
and the miracle became greater, not only in
that he disarmed them by a particular Treaty,
under no other garranty, but that Seal and Oath
they had so many years protested never to con∣fide
in; but made use of the family of <HI>Orange,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="82"/>
which seeming no other way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the
affairs of the world, then in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it great
Captains, could not act towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, with∣out
setting a knife at the throat of its own
glory and reputation.</P>
<P>After so politick an atchievement, he might
have effected another little less considerable, if
we may credit such as determine the affairs of
Princes, according to their particular capacities,
had he (during the troubles of <HI>France)</HI> endea∣voured
a peace with that Crown, which in such
an extremity must needs have accepted it, on
conditions, more advantagious to <HI>Spain,</HI> then
the Towns retaken by it, because giving way to
her intestine commotions, by removing the for∣raign
object that might divert her dissentions
and civil enmities, her fury would have rebound∣ed
on her own bosom, and she like a good Mo∣ther
have abandoned the greatest part of her
conquests, to gain more leisure and better op∣portunity
to chastise her disobedient children:
here it is that considering affairs by their event,
and seeing <HI>France</HI> again in as good a way as
ever to pursue her victories, the Spanish Coun∣cils
are blamed for neglecting that opportunity
of putting such a stop to them, as should have
prevented their progression. Instead therefore
of Treaties with the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> siders with
the Princes, and the Princes themselves, it is
said, <HI>Spain</HI> ought to have negotiated with the
Court alone, from which, as is believed, it might
have had good terms for abandoning the sedi∣tious,
and their endeavors to encourage the re∣bellion,
<PB N="155" REF="82"/>
in which interim, the Catholick King
might probably have succeeded beyond the Py∣reneans,
in reducing the Catalonians, and re∣covering
<HI>Portugal,</HI> much more considerable to
him, because very certain, that the revolt of the
former, and separation of the later, are the
greatest mischiefs, that have attacqued that
Monarchy during the whole war; for remedy
of which, it should have neglected some slight
bruises in other places, and applyed it self only
to the cure of those two wounds so near its heart.
The ways of doing this, had bin more easie, more
safe, and of less expence then those which re∣covered
<HI>Barcelone;</HI> they which examined the af∣fairs
of that time, were of opinion that the Spa∣niards
lost more by retaking that Town, and
neglecting to relieve <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> then they
would have done by some condiscentions to
<HI>France</HI> in order to peace. For it was freely dis∣coursed
in that Court, that the siege of <HI>Barcel∣lone</HI>
cost so dear both in men and money, that
so great a failing of spirits followed, that all the
repose obtained by the French disorders, was
not sufficient to their restoration, and that neg∣lecting
to relieve <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> gave the French
opportunity of freeing themselves from the dif∣ficulties
of appeasing their civil war, and almost
at the same time of re-beginning an offensive
one against the forraigners with vigor equal
to their former. In the judgement therefore of
these criticks, the Spaniards could neither make
all the progressions, might have been expect∣ed
from them in such a conjuncture, notwith∣standing
<PB N="156" REF="83"/>
their recovering three or four of the
principal places they had lost, nor embrace the
opportunity of the peace, to which <HI>France</HI> seem∣ed
necessitated, nor yet supply the flames of ci∣vil
discord already so well kindled, but after so
great charge and small profit, they looked on
them as negligent Merchants that had let slip
the best time of the Fair, and perhaps brought
but one commodity from it, that will never sell
for what was laid down in ready Money, and is
hereafter to be paid for it: I mean the Prince
of <HI>Conde</HI> and rest of the French that are at pre∣sent
only a charge to them, and whom deceased
<HI>Quevedo,</HI> were he now alive, would joyn to the
late Queen Mother of <HI>France</HI> and Duke of—
for that new kind of stratagem by which the
King of <HI>France</HI> may batter by disgusting all his
family, who repairing in discontent to the Spani∣ard,
will oblige him in assisting them to consume
that which is designed to maintain his Armies.
Now the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is retired to them, and
hath no more places nor Troops in <HI>France,</HI>
they seem to understand this, and notwithstand∣ing
the miracles he did at the rout before <HI>Ar∣ras,</HI>
and on occasion of which it is reported,
the King writ to him in these terms. <HI>Mi primo,
he intendido todo estava pardido,</HI> V. A. <HI>ha
conservado todo;</HI> Cosin, I looked on all as lost,
your Highness hath preserved all; they com∣plain
of the large pensions they allow him,
though they pay them ill. In a word, some ob∣serve,
that whilst they consume their Treasure
in entertaining him, and such as have followed
him, the profit of those great pensions accrues
<PB N="157" REF="83"/>
to <HI>France,</HI> as well as the confiscation of his vast
estate, by means of which she may well support
the loss of some Regiments to the weakening
her own and strengthening her enemies Army.
Their esteem for his person is indeed equal to his
merit, and his name is in such veneration both
amongst Nobility and People, that he is looked
on as the greatest Captain that Europe hath
seen in many ages, and to be above all encomi∣ums
due to the highest courages; his actions
surpassing all that can be imagined; notwith∣standing
which they consider him to be a stran∣ger,
and Prince of the blood of a Crown that is
enemy, which makes the establishment of an
entire confidence between him and <HI>Spain,</HI> very
difficult, but to prevent all appearance of such
distrusts, which they have much ado to disguise,
they have made use of an artifice, that hath been
well enough discovered by his Agents; which is,
that such of them as cannot be concealed, are im∣puted
to the misunderstanding between him and
<HI>Fuensaldaigne,</HI> Master of the intrigue of <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
whilst to content him, they find expedients
that rather amuse then satisfy him; to take a∣way
which the Prince hath declared against
<HI>Fuensaldaigne,</HI> and caused his calling home to
be sollicited in Court, with protestation, that as
long as he continues in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> with
the present power, he will not only ruine
his affairs, but the Kings his Masters.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Mazecolles</HI> his Agent told me,
he had made them sufficiently sensible of all the
mischiefs occasioned by this mans conduct, but
<PB N="158" REF="84"/>
the kindness <HI>Don Lewis</HI> hath for him, prevails
against any remedy. That the Arch-duke had
given the same advice, all which could not pre∣vent
their obstinacy in continuing him, ground∣ed
perhaps on this Maxim, which requires (as
well in Kingdoms as Families) to nourish dissen∣tion
amongst those which serve, lest they con∣spire
to betray us, or are not exact enough in
observing the comportments of one another,
nothing being so industrious or penetrating, as
envy and animosity, which prie not only into
what the Master would not be ignorant of, but
into such things of which he cares not for get∣ting
information.</P>
<P>In the mean time let politick Censors, who
often judge of counsels and resolutions, rather
by the events, and what is discernable, than
the inductive reasons of which they are igno∣rant,
please themselves in discoursing according
to their fancies of this great intrigue of State, the
effect of the <HI>French</HI> troubles: they shall not yet
hinder my observing, that in consideration of
several successes caused by them, as well in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
where a King of <HI>Romans</HI> was chosen, as
in <HI>Italy,</HI> where the affairs of the Dutchy of
<HI>Milan</HI> were secured▪ <HI>Casal</HI> changed Master,
<HI>Piombino,</HI> and <HI>Portolongone</HI> were retaken, the
Rebellion of <HI>Naples</HI> severely punished, and that
furious Courser reduced to curb and cavison, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are generally pretty well satisfied, with
little other displeasure than that by not succour∣ing
<HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> they suffered the <HI>French</HI> civil
flames to be too soon extinguished; so that they
<PB N="159" REF="84"/>
cannot without indignation mention the negli∣gence
of the Marquis of <HI>St. Cruz,</HI> when he en∣deavoured
with the Fleet under his command,
that had been fitted up at <HI>St. Sebastians,</HI> to open
the passage of the River to the besieged. He was
encharged with this employment, because not
having comported himself satisfactorily in one
like it, it was believed he would strive to make
amends by some very eminent action in so pres∣sing
a necessity: but he failed even at his first
setting out; for having received his orders at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Fiesque</HI> arrived to
hasten him, he went away in a Litter, with all
the conveniencies of one that had time enough
before him, and as if he had not had a Com∣mission
that required the most extraordinary
diligence. His delays were the same in embar∣king,
and having shewn himself at sea▪ and
scarcely taken view of the Enemy, he retreated
to <HI>la Corugna</HI> in <HI>Gallicia,</HI> where amongst the
delightful Limon and Orange-trees, that grow
there abundantly, he let the bad weather pass
over, and with it the opportunity of securing
<HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> whose loss was the intire ruine of
the disaffected party in <HI>Gasconie,</HI> and of the
Treaty of the Prince of <HI>Conti.</HI> His manner of
proceeding astonished all that were concerned,
though some suspected his orders required no
more but to make a shew of relieving the place;
whether it were that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would hazard
nothing in a War that could not last long in that
part, or whether there were an understanding
(according to the ravings of such as on all occa∣sions
<PB N="160" REF="85"/>
vent their imaginations) by the return of
<HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to its Kings obedience, to obtain the
like for <HI>Barcelona.</HI> Whatever may be of this,
he was secured and confined to a Castle where
he still remains, as is thought, more on accompt
of reason of State then of his guilt.</P>
<P>To conclude, the French troubles presented
great speculations to the chief Minister and o∣ther
Wits here, how far they ought to concern
themselves in them: but those of <HI>Naples</HI> which
happened a little before, and which the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> beheld as a fire kindled in a corner of his
Dominion, he most valued, and distrusted were
no less subjects of the discourse of such as had
curiosity for the affairs of either Crown. All a∣gree
that <HI>France</HI> drew not so great advantages
from them as she might have done, had she
more streightly embraced the <HI>Neopolitan</HI> inte∣rests,
and such as have discoursed with me about
it, have made it evident, that <HI>Spain</HI> in no occa∣sion
ever judged more solidly, or acted more
effectually. At the first advice of that revolu∣tion
she was not deceived in taking her mea∣sures,
and the Earl of <HI>Ognate</HI> giving his sense
of it, made the mischief and its remedy so in∣telligible,
that he was employed to admini∣ster
the later. I saw an Extract of his Letter,
which represented that the fury of that people
could not last, having at first declared open war
against the Nobility and all that were powerful.
That such commotions (the better part of the
State being contrary to them) bring forth on∣ly
confusion and disorder, without any possibi∣lity
<PB N="161" REF="85"/>
of erecting a true form of Government,
which must be done (if at all) in a moment, and
that a multitude that had neither feet nor wings
proportionable to mounting so high must ne∣cessarily
fall of it self, being imprudent in its
Councils, rash in its Designes, and slow and time∣rous
in its Executions. That the people of <HI>Na∣ples</HI>
went very aukwardly about forming them-themselves
into a Republick, beginning by deso∣lation
of the richest Families, which could not
be so totally ruined, but they would retain pow∣er
to joyn with the offended Prince in the pub∣lick
revenge; and that that which would be im∣posed
on this enraged Multitude would be the
more advantageous, in that it would give oppor∣tunity
of drawing the reins of Government
streighter, and binding them so fast, that not∣withstanding
their former several bloodlettings,
a vein should then be opened, by which should
be drawn the greatest part even of that which was
best, provided all that was corrupted came a∣way
with it. His council was followed, and his
hand employed in the Execution, whilest he
doubtlesly played the part of an able Surgeon,
the whole body of the Rebels suffering his lan∣cet,
and the Ringleaders his Saw and Rasor. All
the world is witness of his admirable conduct in
so dangerous a Malady. I shall only add that
he is looked on here as the ablest and zealousest
Polititian of <HI>Spain;</HI> and it is not doubted but if
he had employment suitable to his wishes, he
would add something of vigor that in several
mens opinions is wanting. But his parts being
<PB N="162" REF="86"/>
apprehended he is kept at the greatest distance
possible from the intrigue; and setting aside what
he must necessarily be made acquainted with by
reason of his employments, little is communica∣ted
to him. He therefore passes his time in
building, and employing part of the great trea∣sure
he amassed in <HI>Naples,</HI> on a Pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce that will
be one of the fairest and vastest of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>Among the great affairs and eminent negoti∣ations
of <HI>Dom Lewis,</HI> was one from the North,
whose interest was at first well enough under∣stood:
for none admired that <HI>Spain</HI> kept an Am∣bassador
at <HI>Stockholm</HI> for facilitating the Electi∣on
of the Son of the Emperor to be King of <HI>Ro∣mans.</HI>
The <HI>Swedes</HI> were judged to have great
credit in the Empire, and known to have too
long opposed the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> to look well
on its elevations; a man of parts might sound
their intentions, discover their designes, and by
dexterity allay their greatest animosity against
the Emperor, if not obtain something really fa∣vourable
in his behalf. <HI>Piementelli,</HI> chosen for
this imployment, had success beyond what was
expected, quickly possessing himself of the good
opinion of that Queen, ever charmed by novel∣ty;
for amongst the great affluence of stran∣gers
she drew to her Court, the last comer still
carried it from all the rest. She was so much plea∣sed
in a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> having never yet received any
respects from that Nation, that it was not diffi∣cult
for him to make himself acceptable without
taking pains to corrupt any of her Council.
Such as understood how matters passed in <HI>Swede</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="86"/>
were not suprised at her letters during the Diet
of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> as well to the Emperor, as to the
Electors and other Princes about election of a
King of <HI>Romans.</HI> They easily perceived that the
Counsellors of the Kingdom and ablest heads
had not contributed to so open and authentick a
Declaration in favour of the King of <HI>Hungary.</HI>
During her Fathers reign, and in her minority,
they had been otherwise inspired; and if their
opinions might have prevailed, doubtlesly the
Party of the Princes and Towns had rather been
supported, who demanded a making good of
all that had been agreed on by the Peace of
<HI>Munster</HI> before they would proceed to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Ele∣ction.
This makes easily comprehended that
an Ambassador from this Court was necessary
during all that time, but that he should be con∣tinued
after the resignation of this Princess, and
that when she had left the Kingdom <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iemente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>
should every where follow her under that chara∣cter,
is a mystery, of which no reason can be ima∣gined,
that seems not too flat and feeble to be
real. For why should the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be at such
cost to keep in with this Princess after she had
dispossessed her self of her Dominion, or court
her then, their enemies having received all her
favours whilst she sate on the throne? The <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
I say, that never do any thing, where that
interest, that as much governs Kings as Kings do
Subjects, is not exactly observed: that repine
at the entertaining the many discontented Prin∣ces
that have sided with them, and that seldom
abandon what is solid and necessary, for what is
<PB N="164" REF="87"/>
plausible and superfluous. Notwithstanding all
which they not only caused her to be attended
by an Ambassador, when she had no right to one,
and who (her Prerogative being gone with her
Soveraignty) must needs appear rather a
Gentleman Usher than Publick Minister, but
omitted not to complement and present her
from <HI>Madrid</HI> it self, with 12 of the beautifullest
Horses of the Kings Stable. What is rumored
here that she hath still the disposal of Forces,
and that <HI>Koningsmarc</HI> by her Order marches to
assist the Arch-Duke with an Army of Twelve
thousand men, is a meer raillery.</P>
<P>Her resignation was doubtless a secret of
State, spun and wove with more art than is ima∣gined,
and nothing less than what it seemed;
she retained neither credit nor authority to make
her Mistress of any thing more than her Pensi∣ons;
and though because the Pill was very well
gilt, the World believed she swallowed it wil∣lingly,
and tasted nothing bitter, a Person of
as great judgment as curiosity, told me, That as
the <HI>Palatine</HI> appeared a great Captain when <HI>Ge∣neralissimo</HI>
in <HI>Germany,</HI> he no less approved him∣self
an able Polititian, in a quiet possessing him∣self
of the Crown of the Great <HI>Gustavus</HI> his
Uncle, even in the life-time of his Daughter
and only Heir: The manner of doing this seems
very subtle, for after he was declared her Suc∣cessor
(partly on occasion of the over-heroick
inclinations of that Princess, who seemed amo∣rous
only of her own wit, and more ambitious
to be thought a Woman learned and liberal,
<PB N="165" REF="87"/>
than a Queen prudent and capable of governing
partly by reason of the inclination of the Coun∣sellors
and States of the Kingdom, who grew
weary of obeying a Maid, more sollicitous to be
the Miracle of her Sex than of her Dignity)
and a resolution taken that if she should marry,
it must be with none but him, all his endeavors
tended to make known he was fitter to espouse
the Kingdom than Queen: in effect he quickly
appeared equal to the former, and (were it na∣turally
or artificially) so well acted the part of a
King, that it was very apparent that whilest he
fell back from probability of being such by
means of the later, he advanced in hopes of it,
by the general inclination of the People, and
Interest of State. His Conformity of Humors
and Manners with those of that Coun∣trey,
opened him so fair a way to the Throne,
that the Queen (whose Customs were directly
contrary) became jealous, with such an aversi∣on
for his Person, as she could not sufficiently
conceal. This obliged him to retire to an Island,
part of his Inheritance, leaving all to time and
the Queen her self, who confirmed the People
in their dislike of her. She continued to value
less than she ought the most considerable Per∣sons,
and most important Affairs. Her vast fan∣cy
and ardent thirst after curious Sciences, joyn∣ed
to that extraordinary manner of conduct that
possessed her, made her flie from thought to
thought, and from employment to employment,
without ever fixing on the Duties of her Charge,
and Care of her Crown and Subjects. One while
<PB N="166" REF="88"/>
she was entirely taken up by Letters with <HI>Des
Cartes, Salmasius,</HI> and <HI>Bouchard,</HI> whom she
had sent for, with the first to engage her self
in the Labirinth of his Modern Philosophy,
with the other to trace the Antiquities of <HI>Rome</HI>
and <HI>Greece,</HI> and with the last to penetrate the
Mysteries of the Catholick and Protestant Faith.
Sometimes she abandoned both Books and Scho∣lars,
calling all the first Bawbles, and the last
Pedants. At the time of this gay humor, crowds
of young people that swarmed about her, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed
their time very agreeably. Masks, Balls, Plays,
Collations, Huntings, Tours, with all the lit∣tle
pleasures that are the principal ragouts of the
idleness of Courts, were then alone in request.
Wit and Fancy, with all that boundless and ex∣travagant
jollity can produce, then displayed
themselves with the highest advantages, and
his parts were most applauded, that seemed ca∣pablest
of these fond Diversions which lead from
pleasure to pleasure and pastime to pastime,
without knowing what they seek, or on what
to settle. In these several manners of living she e∣qually
scattered the Crowns Revenue amongst
Strangers, by whose Counsel she governed her
self in many things, and by her own head in all
the rest. This gave occasion to one <HI>Missenius,</HI> a
Physitian or Historian, if I mistake not, that had
been advanced by her, to publish a Book little to
her advantage. He highly extolled the Prince Pa∣latin,
then declared Heir of the Crown, ad∣dressing
himself to him and the Kingdoms Sena∣tors,
for remedy of the disorders he observed.
<PB N="167" REF="88"/>
His Stile discovered him, and the Queen made
appear very great moderation on occasion of his
ingratitude, and the Prince no less address and
judgment, in satisfying her that he too much de∣tested
the Crime of that unworthy fellow, to
have contributed any thing towards it. All
this while a secret aversion for the Queen insinu∣ated
it self amongst the greatest part of the Sena∣tors
and People. Some said they must have a
Soldier to command them, others lamented the
poverty of their Country, and that Rixdollers
were so scarce amongst them. That Peace suited ill
with a Countrey that produced nothing but iron,
which they ought to truck for the Ducats of <HI>Po∣land</HI>
or Patagons of <HI>Germany.</HI> That an occasi∣on
of rupture with one of these could not be
wanting, that the truce with <HI>Poland</HI> was almost
at an end, and that they stood in need of no∣thing
but a King, either a <HI>Charles</HI> or another
<HI>Gustavus.</HI> That all that was defective in his
Daughter abounded in his Nephew; notwith∣standing
all which their respect to the next blood
of that great King, suffered them not to open
their mouths wide, nor to speak publickly; but
whether it were that the Senators had more par∣ticularly
expressed themselves to the Queen in
private, or that of her self she well understood,
by the Conjuncture of Affairs and Inclination
of the People, that she had not long to raign,
or else by some transport of Heroick fancy, or
were it that all these things together contributed
to her renunciation, it at last became publick to
the admiration of all the world. This change was
<PB N="168" REF="89"/>
the discourse of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and as there had
not happened any thing in many Ages so supri∣zing,
every man endeavored to find the causes
of it in a thousand Chymerical reasons. This
great Queen was so unfortunate, she escaped not
the teeth of Satyrists on occasion of it. They be∣gan
by a bad opinion of her understanding, and
jealousie of ill guided Morals; her affections and
judgment seemed very unstable, and her Ene∣mies
reported she quitted not a Crown and Scep∣ter
on a Principle of Vertue to live to her self,
and in a solitude where she might the better cul∣tivate
her Mind and exalt her Faith, but out of
of an inclination to wander, and expose to Fame
that Prodigy of the North she had so highly
vaunted. This so feeble Motive of so great an
Action made some conjecture it was not her
choice, but that her Descent from the Throne
might be glorious, she was permitted or advised
to cover with the Mantle of Generosity and au∣stere
Vertue, the necessity to which they redu∣ced
her of resigning the Crown to her Cosin be∣fore
her death. That great Soul and vigorous
Intellect she ever pretended to, on this occasion
doubtlesly furnished her with such Maximes, it
represented her resigning the Soveraiguty as
much better than its forsaking her, and that by
anticipation of her defeat she should triumph in
it: That a timely retreat is oftentimes better
than an obstinat combat. That a good Horseman
alights, when he perceives his Horse will not
carry him to his journeys end. That she should
do well to imitate that Illustrious Roman that
<PB N="169" REF="89"/>
vaunted to have been employed before himself
desired it, and to have quitted before it was de∣sired
by others; by the first designing the effect
of his good fortune, and by the second giving
testimony of his good Conduct. The Event
shews she yielded to these reasons, and the bet∣ter
to disguise all appearance of constraint, omit∣ted
nothing that might conceal her displeasure.
<HI>Piementelli</HI> her Favorite wrote in such terms to
this Court, clearly discovering the bottom of
this affair and humor of this Princess, with
which he had order to comply, and offer her all
manner of honour and good reception in the
Dominion of the King his Master. He effected
this without difficulty, because so well with her
that all was acceptable from him. Having en∣tirely
resigned her self to his Counsel and Con∣duct,
she had no sooner cast off the Royal Robe,
than she left <HI>Swede</HI> in the Equipage and Habit
of a Modern Amazon. She did not only in her
actions retain nothing of the Customs of her
Sex, whose weakness was so contemptible to her,
but avoided all conversation with it, her Atten∣dants
and Servants were all Men, scorning to use
Women either at her rising or going to bed.
Her own habit was mixed of what is used by both.
A loose Coat reaching to the middle of her Leg,
and under it a kind of Vest almost to her Heel,
a Handkerchief like a Cravat about her Neck, a
Black Periwig, though her own Hair was flaxen;
with a Hat and Feather, were her ordinary Ac∣coutrements,
or rather her Disguise, whilest
she travailed: Nay at <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Brusselles,</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="90"/>
where she continued some time, she changed
nothing; and they which have written of her,
represent her in a Dress very little different. Hu∣mor
or aversion made her alwayes (as much as
possible) avoid the Visits of Women, and as
<HI>Thalestris</HI> for <HI>Alexander,</HI> so she at first expres∣sed
a great impatience and extraordinary passi∣on
to see the Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> She publickly
said, <HI>She was sorry there was no House in</HI> Brus∣sels
<HI>large enough to lodge them both; that he
was her Hero, and the only Man she admired.</HI>
He was at that time at the Siege of <HI>Arras,</HI> whi∣ther
she writ to him she would come, and after
his Example make no difficulty of wearing the
Spanish Colours. This Prince having augment∣ed
his glory, though by an unfortunate con∣clusion
of that Enterprise, her desire of seeing
him was redoubled; to testifie how much she
was concerned in the honour he had acquired by
a retreat that had equalized the defeat of the
Spaniards, to the victory of their enemies. Af∣ter
so handsom advances and obliging addresses
for an Interview she passionately desired, one
would hardly believe she could become cold, and
change so many evident testimonies of impati∣ence,
to as visible ones of indifference. One of
that Princes Agents told me, that out of an hu∣mor
very extraordinary and surprizing, she stu∣died
Punctilio's on the form of his Reception,
when he was even ready to make his Visit. The
Arch-Duke after the rout before <HI>Arras,</HI> went
to see her at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and she received him with
excessive respects and honours; for not satisfied
<PB N="171" REF="90"/>
to attend him at her Stair-foot, she passed over
a great Court, and met him at her outer Gate.
The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> whose courage may justly
equalise him to what is greatest, and whose birth
yields to few that wear not Crowns, desired to
know how she would comport her self towards
him; those he employed in this could never ob∣tain
any satisfactory answer, and therefore
doubting she might make some difference
between him and the Archduke, he resolved not
to see her: but because he was already on his
way, and importuned not to come to an open
rupture, he resolved of an expedient to see her
<HI>incognito.</HI> He therefore sent his Train to attend
her as if himself were gone back, and that he
might see her unknown to her, resolved to enter
her chamber when full of his people, and to ap∣pear
no otherwise than as one of those that wait∣ed
on her on his account. At first she knew him
not, but at last discovering him, when he went
away she would have accompanied him; but he
told her <HI>he must have all or nothing,</HI> and without
staying for an answer went as he came. It is most
certain that he whom she looked on as the Hero
of this age, at that interview lost the opinion that
she was the Heroine. Her resolution yet, that
hath on so many occasions been remarquable,
was not the principal cause of her inequality to∣wards
him: It was a trick put upon her by the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> contrived by <HI>Piementelli</HI> at instigati∣on
of the Earl of <HI>Fuensaldaigne,</HI> that was very
ill with him: For though the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had
expresly ordered that he should be treated e∣qually
<PB N="172" REF="91"/>
with the Archduke, and the same honors
paid him, this was not the first time that more
had been promised at <HI>Madrid</HI> than performed at
<HI>Bruxels,</HI> she who is entirely devoted to the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI>
and governs her self by their Councels on∣ly,
did nothing on this occasion that was not a∣greed
on with them: and most certain that the
Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> made appear such a contempt of
their vanity, and indifference for her, that they
were ashamed as well of their own as his pro∣ceeding:
this obliged the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to endea∣vour
their reconciliation, and to find a neutral
place where they might accidentally meet: which
happened in the <HI>Pall mall,</HI> where a game was
agreed on, in which both of them were on the
same side; but this had no effect, and they par∣ted
with the same indifference as at first.</P>
<P>What I have observed of the humour and
comportment of this Princess, is but the sum of
what I have heard from those that discourse of
the designe of this Court in its many caresses to
her: of which publick curiosity hath gained so
little light, we may conclude that nothing is so
certain as the uncertainty of it. Some will have
that no Northern puissance having been so fatal
to the House of <HI>Austria</HI> as that of the Kingdom
she abandoned, the chief Minister aimed at ac∣quiring
her affection, and making use of her ani∣mosity
against her Country for discovering its
greatest secrets. To this fancy they add, that
it being improbable that the King that succeeds
her should continue long in peace with the Em∣peror,
her Councils and Creatures that continue
<PB N="173" REF="91"/>
in <HI>Swede,</HI> may be useful as most proper
against all correspondence he may have in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
for thwarting the Election of the King
of the Romans, and forming a party capable
of recalling him, with another manner of pow∣er
then what he had before <HI>Prague,</HI> when he
retired with so great regret, and discovered that
if he had not so strong a hand, nor so long an
Arm as the great <HI>Gustavus</HI> his Uncle; he had
no less thirst after victory. Others as ridicu∣lous,
imagine that a principle of generosity and
bounty obliges the King to maintain an Ambas∣sador
with this Queen, to comfort her in her
Eclipse of Dignity, by continuing such an ac∣knowledgement
of Power and Honour; and
that to mitigate her resentments, he will in time
make her Vice-Queen of <HI>Naples,</HI> or some other
Realm, where though she command not over
so largely extended a Dominion, nor with a pow∣er
so ablolute, as when she sate on the Throne,
she will have the satisfaction to enjoy a plea∣santer
Climate. There are that when they must
needs acknowledge they cannot comprehend to
what purpose the chief Minister is so solicitous
in cultivating this Queens good graces, have re∣course
to Zeal for Religion; and that he pro∣poseth
to himself no other end nor other glory,
then to cause an abjuration of her Faith, to fol∣low
the renunciation of her Crown, and to send
her to <HI>Rome</HI> as his triumph for so great a work.
Whatever it be that moves the Spaniards to a
Negotiation, that to most wits seems very use∣less;
this is most certain that if they have com∣placency
<PB N="174" REF="92"/>
for this Princess, she hath no less for
them. For besides what I have already said, I
have had advice that at her arrival at <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
she extolled the beauty of that City with such
excess, she made no difficulty of preferring it
before the kingdom she had quitted; nor of
saying, <HI>She had rather be Marchioness of</HI> Antwerp
then Queen of <HI>Sweden.</HI> It is most certain, that
in <HI>Stockholm</HI> it self, in her familiar discourse she
made it manifest, she had no great value either
for her Countrey or Subjects, whither this were
a designe and foresight, that as she should not
long command the latter, so she would soon
quit the former, or an effectual aversion for
her people, caused by frequentation of stran∣gers,
and contempt of her Countrey by reason
of the relations they made her of the benignity
of the Air they breathed in the parts where
they were born. Besides all this, it is well
known, that after she had testified a desire to
become Mediatress of a peace between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> about which she had discourse with
Mr <HI>Chanut,</HI> when he was to see her, (assuring
him that the Spaniards wished it, and would
put their concernments into her hands, if <HI>France</HI>
would do the like) she was angry when she
knew her interposal was not accepted, and writ
to him in terms very different from the for∣mer,
and more advantagious to <HI>Spain:</HI> amongst
her respects for all that comes to her in the name
of that King, might be reckoned her manner
of living with <HI>Antonio Piementelli,</HI> were it be∣lieved
she had the same value for his Character
<PB N="175" REF="92"/>
as for his person: she hath an extraordinary
propensity to all he propounds, even to a forcing
her own inclinations to a compliance with his.
She is known to be Learned, and to love Books
and Schollars, yet busies her self in trifles to suit
his <HI>Genius,</HI> in such a manner, that if any Learn∣ed
men visit her whilst he is present, she avoids
such discourses as may discover his weakness,
be tedious to him, strike him dumb and con∣strain
that gay humour is reported to be so na∣tural
to him.</P>
<P>Having reported all that the Spanish Criti∣cisms
informed me in those matters of State,
(whether Catholic or Paradoxical) which be∣cause
of freshest date are their most usual en∣tertainments,
and having mentioned their opi∣nions
of those that manage them, or that are
or have bin their principal or accessary objects;
it is time to say something of such Ministers of
forreign Princes as I had the honour to be ac∣quainted
with in this Court, the first of these
was the Earl of <HI>Fieschi,</HI> Agent for the Prince
of <HI>Conde;</HI> he was very kind to us, and being
as well one of the greatest wits as Gallants of
the French Court; it is pity he hath engaged
himself in a party and employment that hath so
much altered his constitution, and changed his
humor, so that he is hardly to to be known by
those that have been most particularly acquaint∣ed
with him: he is fallen into a sickness that
by intervals makes him pale, disorders his pulse
and disables him for company or discourse. He
keeps a good Table, the Countrey he is in con∣sidered:
<PB N="176" REF="93"/>
when we eat with him, it afflicted us
to see him in the middle of a meal rise from his
seat and cast himself on a bed. At access of the
fit, he sodainly changes colour, and one would
think him fainting: this is supposed to be the
effect alone of melancholly and displeasure caus∣ed
by the troubles in which he is engaged, which
have separated him from his relations, estate,
and tranquility of the life he had wont to lead.
He took the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s party out of in∣clination
and generosity only, for it is said, he
had not the least cause of discontent either from
the Court or chief Minister, and his interest
would rather have led him to have followed
the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> and Madamoiselle then a∣ny
other, his wife relating to that Princess; but
he thought he was to go on, and not boggle
when he had once chosen a master. After ser∣ving
him well at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and several ren∣counters,
he was sent hither to give greater
reputation to the affairs of that Prince, man∣aged
by <HI>St Agolin,</HI> in quality of Gentleman of
his chamber. At first he endeavoured to divert
himself by all the recreations this place afford∣ed,
besides which, he enjoyed one peculiar to
himself by reason of the excellent verses he com∣posed:
he was pleased to repeat to us some son∣nets
he had made in praise of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI>
and almost a whole Scene of a piece he begun
in imitation of <HI>Senecas Medea:</HI> but neither love
nor the Muses had charms powerful enough a∣gainst
that discontent and melancholly, which
reduced him to the lamentable condition in
<PB N="177" REF="93"/>
which we lef him; his health being disturbed
by so frequent and sodain alterations as neither
himself, his friends, nor Physitians could under∣stand.
He therefore forsook all pleasures, for De∣votions,
and instead of seeking company that
might divert his thoughts from contemplating
his affairs and infirmity; he made <HI>la Casa del Cam∣po,</HI>
his Hermitage, whither he often went, either
alone, or accompanied by one friend, whom he
tired with silent walking. The King allowed him
a Coach with four Horses, neither good nor bad;
but the Coachman and Footman very ill cloath∣ed
for servants of so great a King. Besides
this equipage which he commands whensoever
he pleases; he hath his particular Train which
consists of Some Footmen, a Secretary, a Ma∣ster
of the Horse, a Page, and some other Of∣ficers;
to maintain himself and them, the King
allows him 1800 Crowns a month and pays his
house-rent: he wears the Spanish habit, and seems
so far concerned in the interests of that Court,
whither really, or to justify his engagement with
it, that he speaks of it with passion, and will
allow nothing to be comparable to the manner
of living in it; this is not because without cause
of complaint▪ but, (as is supposed) obliged by
prudence: He medles with little at present, as
well by reason of his indisposition, as that the
Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> sometime since, sent one of his
Counsellors, who seems to have the intrigue and
principal affairs in his hand; he is called <HI>Ma∣zeroles,</HI>
and well qualified: he hath as much
Learning as is necessary to manage the affairs of
<PB N="178" REF="94"/>
the time; he perfectly understands this Court
and Nation; his wit is solid, yet quick and sup∣ple;
his judgement exquisite, and in the affairs
he handles there needs be no distrust of his
mistaking the shadow for the substance, nor
the point for the hilt; his conversation is both
agreeable and serious in such a manner, that
none go from him without satisfaction, and in∣struction
of many things remarkable in them∣selves
or circumstances. In a word, one may say
of him that his parts are solidly established, both
by Art and nature, were he not tormented by
an Astma, that gives him little repose. This
indilposition was acquired by riding post on his
Masters occasions, and it is so violent, that for
some years he hath not slept but in a chair,
not daring to lie in a bed, for fear of being
suffocated by a defluxion and shortness of wind.
The King of <HI>Spain</HI> allows him also one of his
Coaches, drawn by as many Horses as that which
attends the Earl of <HI>Fiesque.</HI> In the Palace which
is called <HI>Conde house</HI> remain still some of those
that followed that Princes party, and accepted
not the <HI>Amnesty;</HI> the chief of these is Mon∣sieur
<HI>de Trincars,</HI> Counsellor in the Parliament
of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> he is a man of parts and honour,
and that was very well with Monsieur <HI>d' Esper∣non,</HI>
but that carried with the stream, abandon∣ed
himself to follow the fortune of the Prince
of <HI>Conde,</HI> when he came to possess himself of
the Government of <HI>Gascone;</HI> that party decli∣ning,
the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> sent him into <HI>England</HI>
to solicite succors, whilst he was there, they of
<PB N="179" REF="94"/>
<HI>Bourdeaux</HI> returned to their Kings obedience,
which exposed him to a great deal of rigor, the
effects of which, would have been sensible to
his Estate, had it not been secured as his wives
Dowry. That his person might be in no less
safety, he retired to this place; after which, the
Prince made him Intendant of his Army, but
he cannot obtain from these Ministers 500 pistols
the Prince gave him to be paid out of his pen∣sions;
neither doth he solicite them longer, nor
press any thing but his discharge, which he
knows they will not grant without the 500 pi∣stols,
lest his arrival with the Prince, give
him a new subject of complaint by so much the
more just, in that this Counsellor, whom he
summons to an imployment, in which he will
be necessary to him, demands not any gratifi∣cation
or <HI>Ajuda de costa,</HI> as it is here called, but
the payment of part of a sum that is due to him;
by what I guessed, the difficulty lay not in the
expedition of the pasport, but of the Money,
without which they would not have him go a∣way.
In the same house lives also an Agent of
Monsieur <HI>de Marcin</HI> who solicits his Masters pen∣sions
(which amounts to 12000 Crowns a year)
as General of the Kings Armies; besides the assig∣nation
the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> gives on the Money
he draws from hence; all these and some others
that are in this house, live on the 18 hundred
Crowns a month that are given the Earl of
<HI>Fiesque;</HI> it is true, that by the death of <HI>St Agolin</HI>
who was the Princes first Envoye; this charge
will be somewhat eased: <HI>St Agolin</HI> was a Gen∣tleman
<PB N="180" REF="95"/>
of <HI>Auvergne</HI> that lay sick long, and was
at last killed by hot Medicines; they speak very
pleasantly of his Doctors, who after six months
application of all manner of cold remedies, told
him, that since those availed not, they must try
hot ones, and so brought him to his end, in
which he was happier then in so crasie a life: I
saw his Grave, and was pointed out one of the
sumptuosities of this Countrey, which requires
persons of quality to have crimson Velvet or
red Sattin nailed to their Coffin, adorned
with gold and silver Lace, at least on the seams,
if not covered over.</P>
<P>The second Agent or Ambassador of forrain
Princes, was the Dukes of <HI>Florence;</HI> he is a
Clergy-man that wants not wit, of good meen,
and free and affable conversation. His brother,
whom we knew at the great Dukes Court, where
he is very considerable, had given us a Letter for
him, which we delivered quickly after our ar∣rival
at <HI>Madrid:</HI> he received us well, and made
many offers of service to my Lord . . . . . but
gave us occasion to observe that the study of <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
and its near relation to the <HI>Italian,</HI> made
it very difficult for us to use the latter without
mixture of some words of the former: nay some
<HI>Italians</HI> could scarcely avoid this, nor speak their
own languaage with purity after acquisition of
some little of the <HI>Castillian.</HI> No Prince in <HI>Italy</HI>
being more streightened by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> than
the Great Duke, he alwayes keeps an Ambassa∣dor
in this Court to get intelligence of what∣ever
passes: for besides that which this King
<PB N="181" REF="95"/>
possesses in the Isle of <HI>Elba,</HI> he is Master of the
best Havens in <HI>Toscany</HI> that belonged to the Re∣publick
of <HI>Sienna,</HI> and therefore much concerned
in the affairs of this Crown particularly in those
that belong to it in <HI>Italy.</HI> Seignior <HI>Encontri,</HI> of
whom I now speak, is very intelligent in these
matters, and too active and quick-sighted to be
ignorant of what passes here. He discovered
the Treaty of the <HI>Genoueses</HI> with this King for ac∣quisition
of <HI>Pontremoli;</HI> and as soon as he had ven∣ted
the mine, and recived the great Dukes or∣ders
to act with all his might towards gaining a
place so advantagious to him, he so well thwarted
the <HI>Genoueses</HI> in their Bargain, he broke it off,
and struck up for his Master. In acknowledg∣ment
of which that Prince a little after sent the
Ambassador a horse of massie Gold, made some∣time
before for <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, or <HI>Lewis</HI> the
thirteenth of <HI>France,</HI> and removing the effigies
of one of those Kings which was of the same
mettal, there needed no more but to place in its
stead that of <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth, to be presented
to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> who accepting it, decla∣red
to do so on no other termes, but to bestow
it in his Masters Cabinet, where, as was reported,
he effectively placed it. My Lord . . . . . made
many visits to this Ambassador, who also came
twice or thrice to see him; being an Ecclesiastick
he only wore along Robe, without taking the
habit of the Country.</P>
<P>The third forrain Minister was Seignior <HI>Qui∣rini,</HI>
Ambassador for the Republick of <HI>Venice:</HI>
He is very magnificent and splendid, and of a
<PB N="182" REF="96"/>
meen altogether suitable to the Majesty of that
<HI>August</HI> Senate: whose dignity yet he better sup∣ports
by an acquired knowledg of all that belongs
to a person of quality, accompanied by a judg∣ment
whose solidity incomparably moderates the
exuberance of his memory in such a manner,
that the promptitude of the one never clashes a∣gainst
the maturity of the other.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of <HI>Piedmont</HI> called <HI>Ranusio,</HI> who
had been sent by the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to the Dut∣chess
of <HI>Mantua,</HI> his Aunt, made us known to
Seignior . . . . . Secretary of the Embassy, who
presented us to that excellent person. He re∣ceived
us perfectly well, and assured my Lord
. . . . . that the memory of his Grandfather was
dear to the Senate, to whom he had been Am∣bassador,
and that they which then governed saw
so many excellent qualities in that great Perso∣nage,
they mentioned him to their Children▪ as
one of the ablest headpieces had ever appeared
before them; after this he discoursed with us
about the troubles of <HI>England,</HI> and the War be∣tween
<HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> then lately ended,
and told us that the Seigniory of <HI>Venice,</HI> who
was the first that sent Ambassadors to <HI>Henry</HI> the
fourth of <HI>France,</HI> before seated on his Throne,
which the League with great might and fury dis∣puted
against him, and that had made no diffi∣culty
of acknowledging the States of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI>
when they had freed themselves from
the Spanish obedience, had not as yet sent any
Ambassador into <HI>England</HI> to own that Repub∣lick
or Protector. The reason he gave us was,
<PB N="183" REF="96"/>
that that prudent Senate would do nothing it
might be forced to revoke; and though these
later might seem (however so sodainly) better
established than the former, they could not subsist
long, and would therefore wait till their power
were better settled, less tumultuary and precipi∣tous
than as yet: That it would see what time
would do with them, lest with other Sove∣raigns
it might suffer the displeasure to have a∣dressed
it self to Mushrums, who started up in
a night, and might vanish in the morning; for
though the forces and industry of the King of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> had till that time failed of resto∣ring
him to his Throne, it was probable enough
he might recover it by means of internal revo∣lutions,
and such flowings of State, as return
what the like ebbs have carried away. Visits
and acquaintance of this nature give a soul to
travail, when a moment presents one part of
what great Personages resident, in the Country
where he is, have been long acquiring. And as
such men observe all with great exactness, and
have opportunity to do so, their discourses are
sometimes more instructive than some years re∣sidence,
they being usually most open to stran∣gers.</P>
<P>The three Ambassadors I have mentioned
were all we knew here, though there was also
one on accompt of the Emperor▪ called <HI>Comte
Lambert,</HI> who succeeded the Comte of <HI>Grain;</HI>
but we never visited him. At our being at <HI>Ant∣werp</HI>
he was also there with all his Family; his
Wife is Daughter to <HI>Compte Wallenstine,</HI> Lord
<PB N="184" REF="97"/>
High Chamberlain of his Imperial Majesty. He
received the Collar of the Golden Fleece from
the Kings own hands, and went away no less sa∣tisfied
than we, by vacancy of several Chambers
in the Inne, for want of which we did little less
than Camp the night before his departure. He
is a tall man, thin-faced, and of no extraordina∣ry
meen. They say he agreed better with this
Court than the Earl of <HI>Grain,</HI> a bold wit, that
made himself more feared than loved, that
spoke free truths to the King, and medled in
more than belonged to his charge: he slighted
the Order, that no Coach, except the Kings and
Masters of his Horse should be drawn with six
Mules or Horses in the Town. He did not think
himself obliged to observe this, and still went
through the streets as formerly: He was once in
a passion against those that admonished him of
it in the Kings name, whereas the last complies
and uses but four like other Ambassadors.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> hath also an Agent
here, but we had no acquaintance with him;
he lives privately, and the people one day as he
passed called him <HI>Lutheran;</HI> the King himself
(on occasion of a difference he had) not using
terms more favourable. Besides some small in∣terests
of State of his Masters in this Court I
think his residence is only to facilitate the Com∣merce
of his Subjects and Allies, he was upon his
departure, and staid only for a pass from <HI>France,</HI>
that he might not be arrested on the Frontier.</P>
<P>An Envoy of the <HI>Landgrave</HI> of <HI>Armstadt</HI> was
also upon going with more satisfaction, (as I
<PB N="185" REF="97"/>
found by his discourse) as well that he was no
longer to trouble himself with ineffectual soli∣citations,
as that he had obtained (as he thought)
something for his Masters interests. He came
to demand the Pensions the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ought to
pay him according to Treaties made with him
in <HI>Germany,</HI> and of which the arrears mounted
very high, but he carried away nothing but Pa∣per
with assignations very incertain (as I was
told) and no ready mony, besides <HI>Aynda de
Costa,</HI> that is something to bear his charges.</P>
<P>We saw also the Popes <HI>Nuncio</HI> who was like∣wise
on his departure, for which he had long
prepared, but, because he that was to succeed
him, called Seignior <HI>Massimi</HI> (if I mistake not)
had at his landing in the Kingdom of <HI>Valentia</HI>
been arrested in the Kings name, with prohibi∣bition
to go forward, he was fain to stay till that
difference was accommoded, which arose from
<HI>Innocent</HI> the Tenth's sending him that was to suc∣ceed,
without having first given the Court ad∣vice
of it, and known whether it were accepta∣ble;
and since the <HI>French</HI> had on the same oc∣casion
arrested the <HI>Nuncio</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> it was
thought <HI>Spain</HI> might do the like; besides that,
this came charged with some instructions
relating to <HI>Portugal</HI> and this Court, which in
the Kings opinion were not sufficiently Catho∣lick,
who possessed of that title with precedence
of all others, required them after his own fa∣shion.</P>
<P>These difficulties, and such other as concerned
his reception, being at last removed, after his
<PB N="186" REF="98"/>
passing sometime as a private person in the King∣dom
of <HI>Valentia,</HI> he was permitted to come to
this Town, and exercise his function: He arri∣ved
on the Eve of <HI>Corpus Christi,</HI> or a little be∣fore
it, and saw the solemnity through a grated
Window, not appearing because not received;
and he in whose place he came (doubtlessly not
a little troubled to be removed from so profitable
an employment) did that day his last office in
attending the King in that Ceremonie.</P>
<P>Now I am speaking of the Ambassadors and
Ministers of forrain Princes, I will not omit what
I have to say of <HI>Margarite</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> Dutchess of
<HI>Mantua,</HI> who prepared to leave the Court, and
pass the rest of her life in the Dutchy of <HI>Millan,</HI>
where the King had assigned certain lands for
her entertainment. She is Daughter of an In∣fanta
of <HI>Spain</HI> and of <HI>Charles Emanuel</HI> Duke of
<HI>Savoy:</HI> She was married to Duke <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the
last Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> of that Line, and had but
one Daughter during the life of her Father mar∣ried
to the Duke of <HI>Rethel,</HI> Son of the Duke of
<HI>Nevers,</HI> to secure to him the succession of those
Estates as nearest Heir; but <HI>Spain</HI> resolving to
dispute it with him; this woman, whose inclina∣tions
were totally <HI>Spanish,</HI> sided with the house
of <HI>Austria</HI> against her own Daughter; the Com∣motions
that were consequences of this in <HI>Italy,</HI>
are known to all the world, it is enough that I
remember here that this Princess being retired
to this Court, for which she had so openly de∣clared,
was well received, and to employ her
wit and zeal made Vice-Queen of <HI>Portugal;</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="98"/>
where, to speak truth she comported her self
prudently. But the insolence and avarice of the
Ministers imposed to act under her, seconded
by the countenance and approbation of the
Condeduke, at that time Favorite, was so great
she could not prevent their driving the people
to dispair, discontenting the Grandes, and
wronging the Clergy, giving occasion to all of
them to take Arms for reestablishng their liber∣ty.
These things she often wrote both to the
King and his chief Minister, particularizing all
exorbitancies committed, and danger of a gene∣ral
revolt: But the Favourite caused little regard
to be given to her advice, ever crying out she
was a Woman, and all she writ trifles, more
crediting the letters of the Ministers he had
sent with the intrigue than hers; on which ac∣compt
after affairs in <HI>Lisbonne</HI> had changed face,
and a short exile that permitted her not to come
to Court was passed over, at her return from
that lost Kingdom, getting opportunity to speak
with the King, she assisted towards ruining the
Duke of <HI>Olivares</HI> in his opinion. She was af∣terwards
entertained at <HI>Madrid</HI> by his Majesty,
who now at last gave her permission to retire
to her native Country, there to lay her bones,
being very aged. Some nevertheless suppose her
sent into <HI>Italy,</HI> to be a means of inticing the
Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> her Nephew (now of age) from
the French alliance, and of continuing the Duke
of <HI>Mantua</HI> her Grandchild in the Spanish inte∣rests,
into which he entred after the taking <HI>Ca∣sal,</HI>
and from which they distrust he may be bi∣assed
<PB N="188" REF="99"/>
by his great engagements to <HI>France,</HI> as
well on accompt of his birth as of the Estate he
possesses there.</P>
<P>During our stay at <HI>Madrid</HI> we had many
faithful Companions of our Travails Monsieur
...... in whom to the desire of knowing things
that are considerable, is joyned such a compre∣hension
of them, he is become capable of signa∣lizing
himself in service of his Country, as soon
as he shall attain the rank his own merit, and his
deceased fathers services seem to have acquired
him. I will say nothing of his other vertues,
that have made too deep impression in my me∣mory,
to believe they can ever be effaced, I had
the happiness to know him in <HI>Florence,</HI> where
Mr. ..... and he renewed the friendship they
had contracted in their tender years, when they
bore arms together in <HI>Holland</HI> under Prince <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
of <HI>Orange.</HI> Coming out of <HI>Italy</HI> he landed
in the Kingdom of <HI>Valentia,</HI> and from
thence went streight to <HI>Madrid</HI> in hope of
meeting us, but having continued there some∣time,
despairing of our arrival, he resolved to be
gone: when he least thought of us, and could
not expect at <HI>Madrid</HI> in the Middle of the
Spring those that should have passed the Winter
there▪ four horse-men passed by his lodging,
whose habit and horses discovered them to be
of the other side the Mountains, his curiosity ob∣liged
him to follow them to the place where they
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ghted, not a little surprised to find those he had
so impatiently expected: he was then in such an
equipage, that I must confess at first I knew him
<PB N="189" REF="99"/>
not, he wore the Cassock, Rocket, thin and
streight Stockings, with Pumps and Breeches like
Holsters, which so strangely diguised him he
seemed not the same person we had been ac∣quainted
with in <HI>Florence;</HI> his mustaches or
whiskers grown long and turned up with irons,
made me more a stranger to the air of his face, he
not a little resembling the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> of
whom he hath more of the meen in that habit,
than of himself, when clothed after the fashion
of his Countrey. After mutual expressions of
our joy, we acquainted him with the delayes of
our journey, and he told us the successes of his,
and having passed three moneths in <HI>Madrid,</HI>
during which we failed not one day of seeing one
another we resolved to pass together into <HI>France</HI>
by way of <HI>Arragon:</HI> but before we put this in
execution, a Troop of illustrious Strangers, whom
we were very glad to see arrived in <HI>Madrid:</HI>
amongst them were two Gentlemen whose per∣fections
of mind and body made evident, that if
heaven hath given them great advantages by
eminent birth, their education and docility have
contributed no less to that virtue and prudence
which surpasses their age. They brought many
Letters from the Earl of <HI>Fuensaldaigne,</HI> Dom <HI>Ste∣phen
de Gamarra,</HI> and other of the King of <HI>Spains</HI>
Ministers in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> to the best of this
Court, who received them very well, but wanting
the language they took along with them a <HI>Bur∣gundian</HI>
Doctor called <HI>Rognar,</HI> imployed in the
businesses of several Officers that serve in the
Kings Armies, and other persons of his Nation
<PB N="190" REF="100"/>
that are concerned in this Court to be their in∣terpreter,
they were caressed by all, especially by
<HI>Don Lewis</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Ognate</HI> &amp; <HI>Pigneranda:</HI>
Though they resolved to stay at <HI>Madrid</HI> no lon∣ger
then Midsummer day to see the fight of Bulls,
they habited themselves according to the mode
of the Country, and intending within two Mo∣neths
to leave it for <HI>Portugal,</HI> they began at first
to provide horses, and solicit the expedition of
a Pass to make the <HI>Tour</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> notwithstand∣ing
the excessive heat of those Regions.</P>
<P>As soon as we got our Pass we prepared to be
gone, it was in the same form as that we brought
out of <HI>Flanders</HI> from the Arch-Duke, very am∣ple
and unlimited, as well to time as persons.
Having taken our leaves, and besides the Nags
we brought out of <HI>France</HI> furnished our selves
with some <HI>Spanish</HI> Horses, we left <HI>Madrid</HI> the
17th of <HI>June,</HI> taking the way of <HI>Arragon▪</HI> in the
forenoon we rid six leagues, the Country very
dry, which continued to be so till we came to
the River <HI>de los Henares,</HI> on which stands the
City of <HI>Alcala,</HI> in Latin called <HI>Complutum.</HI> It is
very famous for its University, founded (as is re∣ported)
on the Model of that of <HI>Paris,</HI> and like
it divided into several Colledges, every one pro∣vided
of Professors called <HI>Cathedraticos.</HI> Divini∣ty
and Philosophy florish more here than in any
other University of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Salamanca</HI> in the
Kingdom of <HI>Leon</HI> most for Students in the Civil
Law, alone equalls it.</P>
<P>The Town is long but narrow, having little
more than one fair street, in which the Scholars
<PB N="191" REF="100"/>
lodge. Here, as I was told, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>
was a Student, sent by Cardinal <HI>Colonna</HI> when
Legate in <HI>Spain:</HI> the little River of <HI>Henares</HI> that
passes by it makes the land about it fertil, and
renders it more agreeable than the rest of the
Country, where for want of water there are nei∣ther
trees nor grass: leaving here the poste
Rode, and taking the shortest way that led to
<HI>Arragon,</HI> we lay at <HI>Marcamalo▪</HI> about 4 leagues
distant; this is a little Village without any thing
remarkable.</P>
<P>The <HI>18th</HI> we dined at <HI>Hita,</HI> a small Town
seated on the top of a little hill shadowed by a
greater: that night we lay at <HI>Cadadra</HI> a pretty
Town in a Valley: From hence we went the
next morning early, and dined at <HI>Saguença;</HI>
we inned in the Suburbs, where we drunk wine
esteemed the best of <HI>Castile;</HI> but it is like <HI>aqua∣vitae,</HI>
not only strong but fiery, yet bears not
water. Having refreshed our selves, for we had
a very cool chamber, and plenty of snow, we
went to lodge at <HI>Fuente Caliente:</HI> or rather to
do penance there for the pleasure we enjoyed
at noon. Its name (interpreted, the hot foun∣tain)
is not given it without reason; we suffer∣ed
here very much, not only by heat, but bad
accommodation on all accounts; the Host was
rude and barbarous, suitable to so savage a habi∣tation.</P>
<P>The <HI>20th</HI> over a very barren Countrey and
hot Mountains we came to <HI>Arcos,</HI> the last Town
of new <HI>Castile,</HI> where consequently is a Puerto or
Customhouse: It was a Sunday and Holiday, and
<PB N="192" REF="101"/>
the people all at Mass when we passed; we traver∣sed
it very leisurely without any one's saying any
thing to us; but as soon as we were beyond a cer∣tain
gate, by which we went from the Village
to the High-way, in that part very streight by
reason of the Brook and Mountain, and had got∣ten
about 100 paces beyond all the Barricado's,
we perceived people running and calling after us;
I staied to know what they would have, and when
they overtook me, they told me the Puerto or
Custom-house was in that Town. I replied we
we were not Merchants, nor had any obligation
upon us on that account, having sufficient
Passports from the King, and that if they had
had any thing to say to us, they ought to have
done it in the Town, and there have acquainted
us that there was a Custom-house, we having no
<HI>Moco de Mulas,</HI> or Guide to inform us. They
desired that one of us would go back to shew
our Pass, which I did, though unadvisedly; for
I have been told since we might have gone on,
and gained <HI>Arragon,</HI> and so have avoided the
cavils and impudence of those Harpies. When
I shewed my Pass they said they must call a
Council to consider if it were valid, and that
therefore I should send to the Company to re∣turn.
Which being done they told us we might
go <HI>a la Posada, e que toda la nuestra ropa estava
descaminada;</HI> that we might go to the Inn, for all
our baggage was confiscated: then guessing
they intended by terrifying to get money of us,
I bid them read our Pass, which was in these
termes.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I thought this Pass sufficient to prevent these
Publicans detaining us, but thirst of gain in
which, on several other occasions they had had
success against all Justice and Reason, made them
obstinate by expectation of the like. I asked the
cause of their disrespect to His Majesties Passe?
sometimes they said it was shewd too late, and
otherwhiles that it was not on sealed paper; by
which I perceived they designed to bring us to
a composition of 50 or 60 pistols. Finding us
<PB N="194" REF="102"/>
not at all compliable, and that I caused a Cer∣tificate
to be made by a publick Notary;
that <HI>Francisco Salazar,</HI> Alcalde of the place,
stayed us contrary to the Kings Passe, (having
plotted together to that purpose) they began to
talk high, hoping so to terrify us, and the Alcalde
seising our <HI>Valises,</HI> caused them to be carried
to the Custom-house, where opening them he
took an Inventory of all, and not only of such
Money as we had in them, but in our pockets,
and forming an accusation, obliged us to put in
our answers; in which they endeavoured to cir∣cumvent
us, but I looked so near to what they
writ, I suffered nothing to pass I had not spoken,
otherwise protesting against signing it: these
many formalities were made use of to fright
us with the name of Justice, of which, all their
noise and scribling coming short, a Priest that
belonged to them and another fellow that did
the Office of a Secretary, told me in private,
that giving 50 pistols we might go freely; I
slighted this, but told them, I cared not if I gave
them 30 Patagons, though their insolence did
not deserve it. And such indeed it was, parti∣cularly
on the part of the <HI>Alcalde Salazar,</HI> a
Knight of <HI>St Jago,</HI> but an arrant <HI>rascal</HI> as well
as the Customer <HI>Nicholas Lopes de Cordoua</HI> that
had the meen of a Jew; at last they became
impudent and desperately outragious when they
saw they could not effect their design of plunder∣ing
us; and perceiving it, resolved that I should
return post to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to complain of them and
desire Justice; they also provided one to carry
<PB N="195" REF="102"/>
their Justification to the Receiver-General of
the Customs, and sent him away afoot: the re∣mainder
of the day was spent in such contesta∣tions
with them, but at last they suffered me
to go about Eight in the evening; their mes∣senger
being first dispatched: My Lord—
writ all to the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda.</HI> I was im∣posed
upon by them at my first mounting, in
the prices of the Horses; no Posts in the world
furnisht with better then those of <HI>Spain,</HI> nor that
are less ridden; for, excepting such as carry
Letters and some extraordinary Couriers that
are sent to Court from several parts, especial∣ly
<HI>St Sebastians</HI> and <HI>Catalonia,</HI> this way is lit∣tle
made use of, they preferring Hackney Mules:
which indeed are more commodious, as I found
by experience on this occasion, for though the
Horses be good, one is tormented by wretch∣ed
Saddles, with very narrow Seats, high Pum∣mels,
and extraordinary hard. So that to be
mounted in such a manner, one is little more at
ease then on a rack. At the 3d Stage, the hor∣ses
for all furniture had only Pannels with wood∣en
stirrups hung in Ropes. Finding fault with
such equipage; the Postmaster told me, it was
not strange he had no Saddles, and that I should
find the pannel easier, I complied, and at first
was in a great deal of disorder, because I could
not settle on the stirrups, and by reason of the
extraordinary breadth of the pannel; but this
passed over, I liked their Pannels better then their
Saddles, and called for one at the next Stage,
but could not have it, and took a Saddle, not so
<PB N="196" REF="103"/>
convenient as the Pannel I was so unwilling
to ride on. At the 3d Stage they took me for
the express of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> carrying some good
news to the King, which I did not much con∣tradict,
because I found my self better used on
account of it; they demanding for each Horse
but four Rials, about 2 s. 6 d. of our Money.
Few Post-masters keep above two or three hor∣ses;
neither are they obliged to more, They
have Salaries of 3 or 400 Crowns; nay some
500, for the keeping only of two Horses and a
Post-Boy. The Earl of <HI>Ognate</HI> is Post-master-General,
which is very profitable to him; my
Horses were every where very good, and gal∣loped
all the way, but the Postilions often stop∣ping
to give them breath, which they call <HI>Re∣zelar,</HI>
is very troublesome: Besides, that at chan∣ging
Horses, especially in the night, they are
very tedious. The Post way is not the same we
passed in going to <HI>Arcos,</HI> but over a very fer∣tile
Plain, watered by the River <HI>de los Henares;</HI>
5 or 6 Leagues are often rid on the same horses,
because the Posts are not established as they
ought to be at every two Leagues.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Madrid,</HI> after some repose, and
dining with Monsieur <HI>de Mogeron,</HI> I was forced
to stop till the heat of the middle of the day pas∣sed
over, before I could endeavour any thing in
my business, for all here sleeping after dinner,
I could not see the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI> (with
whom I resolved to begin, and for whom I had
a Letter) till about five a clock; and there∣fore
in the interim, went to consult of my bu∣siness
<PB N="197" REF="103"/>
with some friends, and meeting in the
<HI>Calle Major,</HI> a very honest Fleming, called
Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> that understood this Court well,
and spoke excellent Spanish, giving him account
of our accident, he drew a Memorial to be pre∣sented
by the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI> to the Coun∣cil
Royal, not doubting of my success, but ad∣vising
me not to be impatient of delays, it be∣ing
most certain, that this people as much ob∣serve
formalities in the slightest affairs, as in
those of the highest concernment, and withal
letting me understand there was great indulgence
for Farmers of Customs, because the Kings princi∣pal
Revenue, rising from it, their exactions are
sometimes connived at. Indeed, Taxes on land
bring up little or nothing in <HI>Spain,</HI> because the
Countrey is not sufficiently manured, and were
Husbandmen burthened, would be less so, even
to a want of necessary sustenance. He told me
more, that when the Customs are Farmed, it is
done in so absolute a manner, that nothing p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣ses,
not for the Kings own use, without paying;
and if he give any exemptions, they are deduct∣ed
from the Rent the Farmers agreed for. Those
fellows therefore make use of a hundred cheats
(too tedious to be here related) in order to
confiscation, which if they cannot effect with
justice, they forge false suppositions, and under
pretence of the Kings rights, exercise their Ra∣pine
with Soveraignty, and are so insolent, that
on all occasions they vaunt themselves to be the
Kings servants; and a wretched waiter or other
spawn of a Publican, will sometimes be fancy
<PB N="198" REF="104"/>
enough to threaten an honest man to beat him,
or break open his Trunk if he be slow in de∣livering
the Key. In <HI>France</HI> one suffers no less
by the extravagant greediness of this kind of cat∣tle;
and I cannot forget the pains they took at
<HI>Diep,</HI> to send an Army of Guards aboard the
vessel I arrived in, to visit my <HI>Valise,</HI> tossing up
and down my cloaths, annd taxing a bit of cloth
that remained of a suit I had made at <HI>London</HI>
two Crowns; so that if Princes or their Mini∣sters
limit not their exactions, Travailers are
miserably exposed to them, and this is their great
scourge, the more to be apprehended, because
seldom or never punished: the greatest part of
those fellows in <HI>Spain</HI> are thought to be Jews,
and when their plunderings have gorged them
with wealth, the trap of the inquisition is set for
them. Going at nine a clock to the Earl of
<HI>Pignerandas,</HI> he was not returned, but I ac∣quainted
his Secretary Don <HI>Martin</HI> with my
business, desiring him to move it to his Lord,
and to give him the Letter I brought from my
Lord—with the Memorial: the next day
about the same hour I went again, and found
that Lord very much troubled at what had
happened to us, who after, offering me a Coach,
Money, and all else in his power, desired me
to have a little patience, and told me he was
very sorry my Lords—and—were in
so bad a place, and arrested by the insolence of
those <HI>Picaros,</HI> who should be exemplarily pu∣nished,
and we receive all manner of satis∣faction:
the like I did to Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="104"/>
and found the like civility. To make short, my
solicitations had such effect, that the King ap∣pointed
a Commission to be dispatched by the
Council of <HI>Castille</HI> for an <HI>Alguazil de Corte,</HI> and
a Secretary to go along with me to <HI>Arcos</HI> and
bring <HI>Francisco Salazar</HI> to the publick prison
of <HI>Madrid</HI> in order to his punishment, and
an ampler Passport was given me that we might
no more apprehend the like inconvenience.</P>
<P>The Alguazil and Secretary that were ap∣pointed
to go with me, refused to travail by
night, or to ride Post, so that I was fain to tar∣ry
till the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> and then return by
Mule. Experience taught me, that this way of
travailing, is very inconvenient; for, besides
that, for more expedition, the Mules always
trot, one cannot express how much their hard
mouths press and weary the hand, nor what a
torment it is, going down hill to suffer their slow
progression. Being thus excellently mounted,
and in this honourable company; I neglected
nothing towards my speedy arriving at <HI>Arcos,</HI>
whither I came the 29th of <HI>Iune,</HI> and found the
Lord—and—already advertised of the
success of my journey by a Letter from <HI>Madrid;</HI>
I immediately carried the <HI>Alguazil</HI> and Secre∣tary
to execute their Commission; the Alcalde
was much surprized, but making use of his pri∣viledge,
as Knight of the Order of <HI>St Iames,</HI>
refused to obey without a Mandate from the
Council of the Orders. My <HI>Alguazil</HI> who was
of the higher Order, and one of those that are
called <HI>Alguazil de Corte,</HI> often summoned him to
<PB N="200" REF="105"/>
go along with him to <HI>Madrid</HI> as his prisoner,
but he still refused to obey, of which the <HI>Al∣guazil</HI>
took witness, saying; he could not use
force, because that Town belonging to the Duke
of <HI>Medina Celi,</HI> there was no <HI>Corrigidor above</HI>
the <HI>Alcalde,</HI> but that this would undo the <HI>Al∣calde,</HI>
and that he doubted not to return from
<HI>Madrid</HI> with power to carry him thither bound
hands and feet; and we heard afterwards, that
(as Spanish justice never pardons) he was pu∣nished
according to his deserts; the rest of the
Officers of the Custom-house seeing the bad
condition of their Protector, were as compli∣able
and civil as they had been arrogant and in∣supportable:
they returned all that belonged to
us without the least diminution, and they which
before pretended to plunder us, and threaten∣ed
that we should pay for the tedious writings
they had drawn, desired now nothing more
then to be quit, not only of us, but of the prey we
had redeemed from their clutches: we had no
less impatience to get from amongst such Rascals,
which that we might the sooner do, we con∣tented
our selves, to recommend the punish∣ment
of them to those other Harpies, who sel∣dom
suffer such as they seise on to escape, gi∣ving
them all damages and costs we might
pretend the more to incite them to our re∣venge.</P>
<P>As soon as freed from those troubles, we
made all haste towards <HI>Arragon.</HI> Several parts of
this <HI>Province</HI> are very agreeable, and when we
had left the Mountains that inclose <HI>Arcos,</HI> we
<PB N="201" REF="105"/>
came to very pleasant Vallies, and the 29th of
<HI>Iune</HI> in the evening, entred <HI>Erizza</HI> or <HI>Herizo,</HI>
the first Town on that side of that kingdom: the
next day we dined at <HI>Texa,</HI> that hath nothing
remarkable, and lay at <HI>Callatajud▪</HI> one of the
principle Cities of the Kingdom, seated at the
end of a very fertile Plain, but in nothing con∣siderable,
unless in giving birth and abode to
<HI>Lorenzo Brachian Infanzon,</HI> a modern writer,
very famous amongst the Spaniards; he hath
published several Treatises of Morality and Po∣licy,
amongst which, one is called <HI>el Criticon,</HI>
of which, two parts only are printed, a kind
of Satyr, very ingenious in imitation of <HI>Barclais
Euphormio:</HI> in this piece his stile differs much very
from those small Treatises in which he is so con∣cise,
abrupt, and strangely laconick, one would
think he had made it his business to be obscure;
the Reader must often divine his sense, which
found, he perceives an <HI>enigma</HI> hath been made
of something not very extraordinary. <HI>Seneca</HI>
and <HI>Tacitus</HI> are very short of him in this man∣ner
of writing, and if it be said of the former,
that his Stile is Sand without Lime, and that
the second is so mysterious, he contains more
then he expresses: we may conclude that of
<HI>Gracian,</HI> hath so little connexion in its periods
and so much restraint in its words, that the con∣ception
is like a Diamond ill set, whose flame
and luster appear not so that it looses the esteem
of the better half of the work.</P>
<P>There lives in the same Kingdom another
<HI>Virtuoso,</HI> affecting like him the <HI>Lacedemonian</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="106"/>
eloquence, he is called <HI>Vincencio Ivan de Lasti∣nosa.</HI>
by whose means most of the works of
<HI>Gracian</HI> are printed. This <HI>Lastannosa</HI> is looked
on as the most curious person of <HI>Spain;</HI> he dwels
at <HI>Huesca,</HI> the second City of <HI>Arragon,</HI> where
he is reported to have collected a Cabinet
that is a very agreeable Theatre of Grecian
and Roman antiquities; there are many Statues,
Vases, Urnes, Arms, Precious Stones, antient
Moneys, Medals and Rings; in which he is so
well studied, that he hath written a Treatise of
the antient Moneys of <HI>Spain,</HI> which passes for
exquisite in its kind, and rare in its observations.
The first of <HI>July</HI> having dined at <HI>Ofranco</HI> we lay
at <HI>Almunia,</HI> seated in a fruitful valley, and
yielding a fair prospect on which side soever it
is beheld: <HI>Saragosa</HI> is but nine Leagues from
it, and we intended to dine the next day at
<HI>la Muela,</HI> and to arrive before the heat, but
unhappily lost our way on a great heath, with∣out
house, tree, bush, or water; it extended even
to the walls of <HI>Saragossa,</HI> without giving any
opportunity to refresh, or to avoid the Suns
beams for 5 or 6 Leagues. It fell out well for us,
that the day was not excessively hot, so that
our sufferings were not extreme, though
some of the company were in no little choller,
to ride so far without drawing bit, and com∣plained
no less then if they had traversed the
Sands of <HI>Libia,</HI> but it is folly to be troubled
where no remedy can be had, and before our
patience was quite tired, half a League short of
<HI>Saragosa</HI> we came to a Brook, where we all
<PB N="203" REF="106"/>
alit to refresh our selves, and as nothing seems
hard to a sharp hunger, our vehement thirst
made that water (none of the best) to be drunk
with pleasure: we came at last to <HI>Sarragossa</HI>
the capital City of <HI>Arragon,</HI> seated in a large∣ly
extended Plain; it is divided by the River
<HI>Ebro,</HI> but the greatest part of it on the side where
we arrived. A little short of it is an old Castle
called <HI>Alta Feria;</HI> with a pitiful graft about it,
we were told it had formerly bin a palace of
their Kings, and was then of the Inquisition.
The Farmer of the Customs had Guards at the
Gate, who hearing that our servants followed
with our baggage, detained us not long: we de∣sired
notice might be given them, that they should
know where we lodged at the house of one <HI>Red∣mondon</HI>
a Merchant, for whom we had Letters
of credit; we alit at his house and found him
at dinner, he presented us very good Wine,
which refreshed us, and restored the vigor the
long journey and excessive heat had deprived
us of; he afterwards brought us to the best Inn
in the Town, where we had a fair and cool
room, and to prevent our <HI>Valises</HI> being de∣tained
at the Custom-house, whither they must
of necessity be brought; I went to speak with
the Arrendador-General, and shew him our
Pass, which obliged him to be civil and to send
us our baggage as soon as it came to him; we
tarried here all day to repair our loss of bait∣ing
at <HI>la Muelan;</HI> some of the company went
to bed, others only casting off their clothes,
<PB N="204" REF="107"/>
shifted their Linnen. Monsieur—who ar∣rived
last, was the most thirsty, though not the
most weary, therefore he lay not down; but at
his first coming in, drank so much water, and
afterwards so much wine to correct its crudity,
he became sick, besides too suddain an attempt
to quench his thirst; he walked long unbutton∣ed,
and almost naked, not only about the house,
but came to us in slippers and without doublet,
where we were on the banks of <HI>Ebro</HI> that ran
behind the Inn, where we sucked a gentle gale
that came down the river; on the morrow a
Feavor took him which continued 5 or 6 days,
and obliged us to tarry 10 in that City: soon
after our arrival we visited the Duke of <HI>Mon∣teleon,</HI>
Viceroy of this Kingdom; he is one of
the greatest Noblemen of <HI>Naples,</HI> of whom in
the last revolution of that City, the Spaniards
became jealous, though he had served them ad∣vatagiously
in the former: that they might no
longer fear him they sent for him into <HI>Spain,</HI>
and that they might disguise their distrust, made
him Viceroy of <HI>Arragon.</HI> This Charge is ho∣nourable,
but not profitable, the King allowing
but little, and the Kingdom bringing in less,
neither is any thing splendid in his family; we
delivered him the Kings Letter, and that of
Don <HI>Lewis;</HI> having read them in our presence,
he made us offers of all that lay in his power:
he seemed not to us of a Genius much elevated,
whither his resentments of the Spaniards ill usage
have dejected it, or whither he conceals a part,
least ostentation of the whole might be preju∣dicial
<PB N="205" REF="107"/>
to him. Besides the Viceroy, whose charge
ceases every three years; here is a Governour of
the City, or rather of the Countrey, since his
power is reported principally to extend over it;
this Charge is the more considerable because for
life.</P>
<P>Though the Viceroyalty and Government of
<HI>Saragossa</HI> are the two great charges of this King∣dom,
yet no authority is equal to that of the
Chief Justice, called <HI>El Justicia,</HI> to shew that he
is to <HI>do justice</HI> in all and above all: so that he
determines of what concerns the King, King∣dom,
Subjects, Laws and Priviledges: but for
the better understanding this, and that which I
shall hereafter observe touching the great con∣testation
here between high powers: it is ne∣cessary
that I set down what I have been told
concerning the Priviledges of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>After the Moors had entred <HI>Spain,</HI> on occa∣sion
of the Injuiry done by <HI>Don Rodrigo</HI> to
Comt <HI>Don Julian</HI> in person of his Daughter,
called <HI>la Cava,</HI> whom he ravished, <HI>Arragon</HI>
was the first Province that freed it self from the
yoke of the Infidels, and that finding not only
the race, but memory of its ancient Kings total∣ly
extinct, by it self, made a recovery of
its self, to it self, without owning any Sove∣raign.
But lest they should be a Body without a
Head, and that they might enjoy secure repose
in their new liberty, they soon after deliberated
of electing a King, and cast their eyes on a pri∣vate
Gentleman called <HI>Garcia Ximenez.</HI> It must
yet be acknowledged that they made him rather
<PB N="206" REF="108"/>
Prince or President of their State than their So∣veraign;
and in imitation of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> so
much limited his authority, that that of <HI>Theo∣pompus</HI>
was not more streightned by the <HI>Ephori,</HI>
than that of this King by the rules imposed upon
him: and it being very easie to violate the most
fundamental Laws of a State, when the supreme
power is concerned so to do, if there be none
with hazard of his life obliged to watch for their
preservation, they established <HI>El Justicia,</HI> a Ma∣gistracy
of which I have spoken, that who
might fear nothing in the vigorous executing his
charge, they ordered he should not be liable to
condemnation either in person or goods on
what accompt soever, but in the general Assem∣bly
of Estates called <HI>las Cortes,</HI> that is the King
and Kingdom.</P>
<P>Having thus bound up him they should elect
for their King, they made a Law called <HI>de la Va∣jon,</HI>
which imported that as soon as the King in∣fringed
their Priviledges, it should be in their
power to elect another, though a Pagan; and in
case of wrong to any Vassal or Subject, the No∣bility
and most considerable of the Realm might
assemble to protect him, and hinder any duties
to be paid the King, till the party injured were
indemnified, and the Priviledge re-established
in its former validity. They erected <HI>El Justi∣cia</HI>
as Gardian of this Law, (with several others,)
who for greater authority sate in a Chair with
his hat on his Head, whilst the King bare and on
his knees swore their Priviledges between his
hands: afterwards they owned him as their
<PB N="207" REF="108"/>
King, but in a very grange fashion; for instead
of vowing fidelity, they told him <HI>nos que valemos
tanto como vos os hazemos nuestro Rey y Sennor, con
tal que guardeis nuestros fueros y libertades, sino,
no:</HI> that is, We that are equal to you make you
our King and Lord, on condition that you pre∣serve
our Laws and Liberties, and if not, not.
This detestable fashion of owning a King so
much disgusted <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> surnamed <HI>the Dagger,</HI>
that partly by intreaty, partly by intrigue, and
offering other Priviledges in the place of it, he
caused it to be abolished in an Assembly of the
Estates, and as soon as he got the Parchment in
which the Law for it was written, voluntarily
cutting his hand, he said; that a Law which im∣ported
that Vassals might elect and limit their
King, was to be effaced with the blood of a King.
<HI>Ley de poder elegir Rey los Vassallos sangre de Rey
avia de Costar,</HI> these are reported to be the ve∣ry
words he pronounced, on which occasion
the surname of <HI>the Dagger</HI> was given to him:
His Statue is yet to be seen in <HI>Saragossa,</HI> in the
Hall of Deputation, with the Dagger in one
hand, and the Priviledge cancelled with his
blood in the other. And indeed the sacred blood
of Kings can on no accompt be better employ∣ed
(no not against a forain Enemy) then in sup∣pressing
such exorbitant Priviledges of Subjects
as destroy the very foundation of Monarchy.</P>
<P>Besides the two Priviledges I have mentioned,
not at all regarded by later Kings, there is ano∣ther
still in force called the Law of manifesta∣tion:
by this every Subject that thinks himself
<PB N="208" REF="109"/>
injured either in goods or person, by what Tri∣bunal
soever, may complain <HI>a el Justicia,</HI> who
is obliged to make an exact enquiry, and cause
the Judge that hath given a corrupt sentence
to be punished. This City at our being there
was much discontented, because endeavours
were used to violate this Law. Teo Judges
were accused for a Sentence by which a certain
Woman thought herself injured, who, according
to custome, deputed 500 Crowns, and com∣plained
of the Judges. The King, the Tribunal
<HI>d'el Justicia,</HI> the Viceroy, the Governor, and
some others that sought to augment the Autho∣rity
of the Prince, and lessen the Kingdoms
Priviledges, took these Judges into their prote∣ction.
The Party grieved finding she could get
no remedy, for the wrong she pretended done
to her self and the Law, had recourse <HI>a las Cor∣tes,</HI>
or the States of the Kingdom, who (though
the Inquisition favoured the Judges that were
accused) deputed Commissioners called here
<HI>Judicantes.</HI> These are 9 persons drawn from
the four Bodies of <HI>Arragon,</HI> that is the higher
Nobility intituled <HI>Sennores,</HI> the Clergy, the Gen∣try
called <HI>Hidalgos,</HI> or <HI>Cavalleros,</HI> and the Ci∣ties.
From the first of these Bodies three are
taken, and from each of the other two they u∣sually
make choice of the most illiterate to
judge Gown-men, whether that it may be done
without partiality, or that their Laws ought to
be so plain, that even Peasants and others the
most ignorant may understand their equity, and
judge if it hath been observed.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="109"/>
These 9 Deputies or Commissaries condem∣ned
the Judges of injustice, and ordered them
to be banished, and their Estates confisca∣ted.
This Sentence made great noise, and the
Viceroy and Governor by order of the Court did
their best to hinder its effect, nay the King him∣self
writ to the <HI>Justicia.</HI> The People concerned
themselves in the business, and Pasquils and
Libels were every where cast abroad with mena∣ces,
should it not be put in execution. Coun∣trey
people flocked to the Town, entertain∣ing
themselves only with the violation of their
Priviledges. Doubt that this affair going to ex∣tremity
might cause great disorders, in a time
when the War of <HI>Catalonia</HI> made the People of
<HI>Arragon</HI> more fierce and hardie, caused the Vice∣roy
and other favourers of the Judges, without
any farther unseasonable mention of the Kings
pleasure to suffer them to be dismist from their
charges, and banished the Town. Were the like
practised in all places, there would not be so
many sentences given out of favor, passion, and
interest, rather than according to law and equi∣ty,
not distinguishable but in this one part of
<HI>Europe,</HI> where the Judges are reported to trem∣ble
when they give sentence, fearing it may be
their own condemnation, either as to body or
goods, if unjust or erroneous in the least. Not∣withstanding
all this, justice here is soveraign;
for though the Judge that hath determined a∣miss
be punished, the Sentence he hath pro∣nounced
remains in full efficacy: so that he
which accuses his Judge hath only the satisfacti∣on
<PB N="210" REF="110"/>
of revenge, and serves the Publick rather
than himself, by preserving the Peoples Privi∣ledges,
in prosecuting him that hath done wrong,
and putting other Judges in mind of their duties.
He that is found to have accused his Judge
without cause only loses the 500 Crowns he de∣positated,
and though it appear he have reason,
recovers little more, which in that case is levied
on the Estate of the unjust Judge. The banishment
of those two Judges freed <HI>Saragossa</HI> from appre∣hension
of troubles, the People, by execution of
the Sentence, satisfying themselves, that at that
time no attempt would be made upon their Pri∣viledges.</P>
<P>Had we continued longer at <HI>Sarragossa</HI> we
might have seen a Ceremony observed in be∣heading
Murtherers; for he which hath slain a
man face to face, receives the stroke that
beheads him before; but such as treacherously
came behind him are punished in the same man∣ner:
this is only for distinction sake, for pro∣bably
the blow behind gives less pain to the
Criminal than that before. Whilst we sojourn∣ed
in this Town we received many civilities from
<HI>Dom Pedro Miranda,</HI> born at <HI>Oleron</HI> in <HI>Bearn,</HI>
and one of the richest Bankers of this Town.
We had Letters of credit to him, of which
though we made no use, he did us all manner of
good offices, every day sending us his Coach,
and sometimes accompanying us to what was
most remarkable. The Buildings here are large
and high, and generally fairer than in <HI>Madrid:</HI>
there is one long and broad Street where the
<PB N="211" REF="110"/>
<HI>Tour</HI> is made as at <HI>Madrid</HI> in the <HI>Calle Major.</HI>
The most considerable house belongs to the
Duke of <HI>Villa Hermosa,</HI> who pretends to descend
from the ancient Kings of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and thinks
they which enjoy the Crown do him wrong.</P>
<P>To speak generally of the humor of the Peo∣ple
of <HI>Arragon,</HI> they are no less proud than the
<HI>Castilians,</HI> and value themselves above them
and all other of <HI>Spain;</HI> and it must be
granted that they are equal to, and sometimes
surpass the most of them in wit, whether applied
to good or evil. Their soil is barren, and, ex∣cepting
some Valleys and such parts to which
the waters of <HI>Ebro</HI> are conveyed by cut Chan∣nels
to moisten it, all sand, heath and rock,
so that it hardly affords corn to sustain its In∣habitants.
Though so little fertil in fruits it hath
ever produced gallant men, and from their first
King to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> they reckon not one that
made not himself considerable to his Neigh∣bours,
either by his wit or courage: that last above
all other was so prodigious in the art of reign∣ing,
and vast ambition ill suited to the narrow
limits of his little Kingdom, that he endeavou∣red
to extend them, and did so even from
the foot of the <HI>Pireneans</HI> to the Streights of
<HI>Gibralter.</HI> That success with some other put
him upon the design of an universal Monarchy,
and his Successors are still accused to retain the
Intrigue and Model of it, which he then impart∣ed
to his Grandchild, who was to be Heir of so
many Provinces, and in his own person unite
the many Dominions, that when single had been
<PB N="212" REF="111"/>
so formidable to their Neighbours: Besides which
he had the wealth of a new World to facilitate
his enterprise, and assist towards establish∣ing
so vast an Empire, as had never been known
before. It is true, some of the curious say, that
to pretend he had a thought of this, is to accuse
him of a Chimera; but that famous <HI>Arragonian,</HI>
who hath given us a contracted draught of his
Politicks, tells us <HI>Parecieronle a Ferdinando Estre∣chos
sus hereditarios Reynos de Arragon para sus
dilatados desseos, y assi anhelo siempre a la grande∣za
y anchura de Castilla, y de alli a la Monarquia
de toda Espanna y aun a la universal de entram∣bos
mundos;</HI> which is to say, <HI>The vast designs of</HI>
Ferdinando <HI>being too much confined in his here∣ditary
Realms of</HI> Arragon; <HI>he first aimed at</HI> Ca∣stille,
<HI>then at the Monarchy of all</HI> Spain, <HI>and at
last of both worlds.</HI> He was not for all this any
great Captain; neither was this ambition the ef∣fect
of valor, living in a time when wit and
policy bore more sway then courage. He made
use of the politicks of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XI. of <HI>France,</HI>
the industry of Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the VI. the
subtilty of <HI>Lodowick Storza,</HI> Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> the
vigilance of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. of <HI>England,</HI> and
prudence of the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> the I.
All their dissimulation and all their cunning the
put into so good a cruicible, that he separated
what was solid from what was airy, discover∣ing
what was strong and what weak in them,
and extracting such an establishment for him∣self
and successors, that <HI>Philip the</HI> II had great
reason, when looking on his Picture, he said;
<PB N="213" REF="111"/>
<HI>We owe this man all.</HI> Spanish writers are trans∣ported
when they speak of the grandeur of
their Royal Family, some of them even to impi∣ety,
and a modern Author says of it, <HI>Casa que
escogio dios en la ley de Gracia, assi como la de
Abraham en la Escrita, para Ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>marse dios de
Austria, Dios de Rodolpho, de Philippo e de Ferdi∣nando.</HI>
A Family elected by God in the new
Law, as the seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> in the old, that
he might call himself the God of <HI>Austria,</HI> the
God of <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> of <HI>Philip,</HI> and of <HI>Ferdi∣nand.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the people, amongst whom
this dextrous Prince was born, and whom the
Polititians equalize to <HI>Tiberius</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> the
XI of <HI>France,</HI> for a third Idol of their <HI>Ragione
di Stato;</HI> I must add, that they are nothing hos∣pitable
nor civil to strangers. Their lofty humour
is not allaied with so much affibility as that of
the <HI>Castilians,</HI> and it is from this Province, that
the Highway-men they call <HI>Vandaleros</HI> spred
themselves even into <HI>Castille,</HI> making the Roads
very unsafe; perhaps, by reason of its being so
near a neighbor to the war, its inhabitants in∣cline
more to Arms then other Spaniards;
the Gentry certainly pretends to an effectual
Gallantry, by continual protestations, they are
ambitious of nothing so much as drawing their
swords in their Kings service: neither are
they free from the Rodomontados natural
to all Spaniards, and I was told that a young
Gentleman having mounted himself, with all
advantages his purse would reach to, to go in∣to
<PB N="214" REF="112"/>
to <HI>Cat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lonia,</HI> and serve a Campagnia, pleased him∣self
above a Month in riding about the streets of
<HI>Saragossa,</HI> sometimes on one horse, sometimes on
another; and meeting any that commended his
Horses, his Arms, or his own activity; he asked
whither with such an equipage and arms as his, it
were not easie to draw the Frenchmens teeth: <HI>con
estas armas y esto Brao no se sacaran las muelas a
los Gavachos?</HI> He no sooner arrived in <HI>Cata∣lonia,</HI>
but he met an opportunity of shewing
his courage, but was so unfortunate, he was at
first wounded both in his arm and leg, which
last was for ever lamed, and he ever since called
the Tooth-drawer. In the mean time if the war
have in some manner incomoded this kingdom,
it hath made it richer, for the passage of the
forces and rendezvous of Ammunition have
caused the Kings money to Roll up and down
in its chief Cities; and having particular privi∣ledges,
and not governing it self according to
the Courts Orders, but its own customs, not∣withstanding
the war with <HI>France,</HI> it ever kept
up a Trade beyond the Mountains; and the
Merchants of <HI>Oleron, Tholouse,</HI> and other parts
of <HI>Bearn</HI> and <HI>Languedoc,</HI> pass and repass free∣ly,
as well to <HI>Saragossa</HI> as the adjacent quar∣ters,
nay the greatest part of the Banquiers of
<HI>Saragossa</HI> are of those Countries. It is true they
are concerned to make no noise of this, nor to
do any thing that may give the least occasion of
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling upon them; for being known to be rich,
Justice looks on them as a prey she would be glad
to have pretence to seise on. <HI>Don Pedro Mi∣randa</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="112"/>
is one of the most splendid of these, and
best supported, having married a Wife very well
allied in this Country. He is the most curious
person in <HI>Saragossa,</HI> and by every Ordinary re∣ceives
the Gazets of <HI>Paris,</HI> and other written in∣telligence,
but communicates them not except
to particular friends. He told us that at the time
of the Siege of <HI>Arras,</HI> there came an Order
from <HI>Madrid</HI> to the Magistrate of this Town,
to make preparations for a publick rejoycing for
taking a place of so great importance. None
doubting to hear very sodainly of its surrender,
Scaffolds were begun to be erected for a fight of
Bulls; before which were half finished, <HI>Miran∣da</HI>
by a particular Letter understood that <HI>Arras</HI>
had been relieved: but not daring to publish
such bad news, he (with admiration) saw that
work go on, yet could not imagine but the Vice∣roy
and other of the principal Inhabitants had
the same intelligence with him, though they pre∣pared
for a triumph before a Victory. A while
after, and when all was ready for the Festival,
the Viceroy received a Letter from <HI>Madrid</HI>
that the Siege of <HI>Arras</HI> had failed, who sending
for the Governor and Magistrates of the Town,
when he shewed them his Letter, they were not
a little surprised, and for their better satisfaction
summoned <HI>Miranda,</HI> who acknowledged that
besides that one of his correspondents in <HI>Paris</HI>
had acquainted him with it eight dayes before,
he had then with the Gazets, received a Print
which gave all the particulars. One of the Ma∣gistrates
grew very angry and ready to af∣front
<PB N="216" REF="113"/>
him, that he had not advertised them to
prevent the unnecessary charge, and their being
laughed at by the people, threatning that he
should be made to pay the four or five hundred
pound it had cost the Town. But the Viceroy,
and such as were more moderate, pacified that
man, and sent away <HI>Miranda</HI> without ever after
troubling him about it. The people in the mean
time seemed more concerned for pulling down
the Scaffolds erected for the Festival, than for
the failing in recovery of <HI>Arras.</HI></P>
<P>After we had sojourned eight dayes at <HI>Sara∣gossa</HI>
and resolved to return into <HI>France</HI> rather
by <HI>Navarre</HI> than <HI>Catalonia,</HI> where, as was re∣ported,
was neither safety nor convenience for
travailers, we took leave of the Duke of <HI>Mon∣telion,</HI>
who gave us a Letter for the Earl of <HI>St.
Stephen,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Navarre:</HI> the 10th of <HI>July</HI>
we went away, and lodged at <HI>Halagon,</HI> a poor
Village. A Factor of <HI>Miranda</HI> called <HI>Bertrand</HI>
served us as Guide in this Journey, and we had
in our company a Spaniard, a man of parts and
good fellow according to that Countries mode.
He travailed in a very pleasant equipage; ac∣cording
to the faishon of <HI>Spain;</HI> his Valisa he
carried before him on the pummel of his Saddle,
leaning upon it, at each side and on his thighs
hung his Wallet of provisions, instead of Hol∣sters
two leathern Cases contained two bottles
of wine, cooled by ice he put in every time he
filled them: for which reason such cases of lea∣ther
are called <HI>Refread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res.</HI> Every league or half
league he drew out a bottle, and very civilly in∣vited
<PB N="217" REF="113"/>
us to refresh our selves with his wine,
which when we excused he made use of <HI>Ber∣trand</HI>
(better accustomed to such debauches
than we) to bear him company. He told us
many pleasant stories, but I have forgot all but
two gallantries of the Duke of <HI>Ossuna,</HI> so fa∣mous
for wit and humour, when Viceroy of <HI>Na∣ples.</HI>
One day, he said, to revenge himself of
a Widow that had been something cruel to him,
and who, he yet knew, was not so to every
body, he caused a certain Frier suspected to be
well with her, and that was believed the con∣solation
of her Widowhood, to be watched:
As soon as he knew he was in her house, he
came, and with his Gards invested it, command∣ding
the door to be opened, for a search that
was important to the Kings service: it was late
in the night, yet the Servants were so much sur∣prised,
that they let him in whilest the Monk was
with their Lady, without giving her any notice.
He tarried rallying with her all night, and about
8 in the morning caused the reverend Frier to
be taken up behind a Trooper, a Trumpet going
before, which was to make a stand at every turn∣ing,
and after sounding to point him out and
say: whoever stand in need of a Frier to comfort
Widows at midnight, let them address themselves
to this Gallant, and they shall be accommodated;
afterwards he sent from Cloyster to Cloyster to
enquire which of them had lost a Frier, and when
discovered, returned him to his Abbot, who
was to be intreated at his going to bed to take
with him the Key of that good fellows Cell, least
<PB N="218" REF="114"/>
he might wander another time. His other sto∣ry
was, that three Curtesans living at <HI>Naples</HI>
so excessively proud they hardly bowed
when they met him, he caused them one day to
be invited to a Collation; they failed not to come
drest to all advantages, but with difference,
as well in that as in their beauties, though alike
proud; so that they played the Queens with this
Viceroy, who received them very civily; but
perceiving they became nothing more humble,
be obliged them to undress themselves on pre∣tence
of heat, and being two much streightned
in their clothes, afterwards causing many Com∣fits
to be scatte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the Chamber, he made
them gather them up without quitting their
Chioppins, whilst with a Trunck he shot
the sugar pellets sometimes at one, some∣times
at another. The Father of this Spaniard
had been the Dukes Servant, and he told us ma∣ny
such tales, which I shall not trouble my
self to repeat, they not deserving it no more
then these, which I have set down only to dis∣cover
the Genius of this Nation, very much ta∣ken
with trifles and frothy relations. Besides
such Gallant Stories which they call <HI>Dounosas,</HI> or
conceits, they have others that they stile He∣roick,
amongst which are reckoned all the Sen∣tences
of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> Apothegms of <HI>Charles</HI> the
fifth, and Reparties of <HI>Philip</HI> the second: those
of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth they say imply Courage, of
<HI>Philip</HI> the second Prudence, of <HI>Philip</HI> the third
Piety, and of <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth Love; but their
greatest esteem is for those of <HI>Philip</HI> the second,
<PB N="219" REF="114"/>
whom they take to have been a Prince of the
quickest and sublimest fancy: amongst many o∣ther
testimonies of which, they with admiration
report this of his wit and liberality. A certain Por∣tughese
having brought to his Court a Diamond
of great value, immediately looked on by the
Courtiers as the richest Miracle the East had ever
produced, he not at all moved, beheld it with in∣difference,
which the Portughese perceiving, said,
<HI>Sennor setenta mille ducados que abrevie en este dig∣no
nieto del sol no son de asquear: Sir, seventy thou∣sand
Ducats which I have contracted in this wor∣thy
ofspring of the sun are not contemptible;</HI> the
King pleased in his confidence, asked what he
thought when he laid out so much upon it, and
the crafty Portughese answered. <HI>That there was
a Philip the second.</HI> This sublety or flattery was
so agreeable, that <HI>Gracian</HI> who relates it in
his <HI>Hero,</HI> adds that the King immediately not
only paid for the Diamond▪ but gave him more.
<HI>Ostendando</HI> (sayes he) <HI>la superioritad de su gusto en
el precio y en el premio,</HI> manifesting the height
of his satisfaction in the price and in the reward.
The jollity of this Spaniard, who travalled to
<HI>Biscai,</HI> hath made me forget to follow my own
way; but having omitted nothing of what I
saw or heard, the follies I have now set down
may pass amongst the rest. He will give me no
farther occasion of digression; for we parted
at <HI>Tudela,</HI> a pretty Town, but as standing on the
Frontiers of <HI>Castile, Arragon,</HI> and <HI>Biscay,</HI> a
Nest of Rogues and Banditi, that have forsaken
their Country to escape the punishment due to
<PB N="220" REF="115"/>
their crimes; yet in some parts of it there are
fair buildings, which makes us believe it is inha∣bited
by some people of quality amongst the
exiles. At our going away the Guards pretend∣ed
to stop us, but seeing our Passport durst not
persist. We were told that the Cardinal <HI>de Rets,</HI>
after he had escaped out of <HI>France,</HI> passing from
St. <HI>Sebastians</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Valentia,</HI>
where he intended to embark for <HI>Italy,</HI> was
stayed and very streightly garded in this City.
He came in a Litter with a small Train, and
the Alcalde who was then walking on the Bridge,
sent to demand who he was, but he unwilling
to be known, refused to tell his name and quality,
upon which the Alcalde set a Guard upon him
in the Inn where he alighted. This surprised
him, and he knew not what to think of such
usage in a Countrey where he thought he had
secured the liberty lately recovered, and that he
should not have lost it as soon as he began to
rellish it: he therefore dispatched one of his
Servants to <HI>Pampeluna,</HI> with a letter of his arri∣val
to the Viceroy, desiring him to punish the
insolence of that Judge, and deliver him out
of his hands: The Alcalde in the mean time
sent to the Viceroy and Council of <HI>Navarre</HI> a
formal Narrative of what he had done, accord∣ing
to the duty of his place, hoping so to avoid
the blame might be laid upon him; for having
acted rather on account of humor and curiosity,
then reason and judgment: then he had no other
advantage by his Letter, than the preventing the
Cardinals enlargement one day, because the
<PB N="221" REF="115"/>
Viceroy was obliged to assemble the Council of
<HI>Navarre,</HI> where the punishment of the Alcaldes
insolence was resolved on, and he turned out of
his place, and for some time banished the Town,
where the Cardinal as soon as known received
many civilities, and at his going away was at∣tended
by the principal Inhabitants with all re∣spect
and honour. At that time came news that
the <HI>French</HI> had stormed the lines, and beaten the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> from before <HI>Arras,</HI> but he maintained
so effectually that this was impossible, that he left
in all places where he came a contrary impressi∣on,
which continues still amongst those people.
<HI>Pedro Miranda,</HI> or some that belonged to him,
being then at <HI>Tudela,</HI> shewed him Letters of it
received from <HI>Paris,</HI> but he persisted. One
may easily perceive he endeavoured to cajole
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by this flattery, not at all con∣cerned
that time would destroy it▪ provided it
obtained him the better reception in his passage,
and made them sensible that he had intirely en∣gaged
himself in their interests.</P>
<P>The 12th of <HI>July</HI> we dined at <HI>Laborosso,</HI> and
traversed <HI>Olitor,</HI> where the antient Kings of <HI>Na∣varre</HI>
kept their Court and something of their
Palace still remains, though the Town be now
a miserable Place, ruined by warrs between the
true Inheritors of the Crown, and such as inva∣ded
them: we lay at <HI>Tessalia,</HI> a good Town,
and its Territory more fertil than the rest we
had passed. Next day we came to <HI>Pampeluna,</HI>
the capital City of that Kingdom, it stands at
the end of a large Plain that seems but barren;
<PB N="222" REF="116"/>
it is near the <HI>Pireneans,</HI> yet out of command of
any eminence. Its Citadel, so famous in the
world, looks towards the Plain, and is on one
side environed by a great Marais. The Town is
not considerably fortified, and the ground it stands
on hath many little risings and descents scarcely
perceptible: there is a large Piazza where the
Bulls are fought. The people are clownish,
much addicted to small Traffick, which they free∣ly
enough exercise with <HI>France,</HI> and as if there
were no war between the two Crowns: We ar∣rived
at the end of a Fair, and met many French
Merchants: we tarried here three dayes as well
because of the indisposition of my Lord—
not well recovered of the Fevor he got at <HI>Sara∣gossa</HI>
as that one of our horses were lame. The
mean while we visited the Earl of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI>
Viceroy and Captain General of this Kingdom▪
and delivered him the Letter we brought for
him; he is a little man very civil, and no less cu∣rious
of all rarities. He received us well,
and ordered the Captain of his Guards to shew
us the Citadel in the afternoon. Between the
Town and Citadel is a spacious place set with
trees for Walks: it hath five Bastions, and was
built by <HI>Philip</HI> the second with a great deal of
consideration, as a strong Rampier against
<HI>France:</HI> the Bastions are covered with Stone,
the Grafts large, in most parts of them water;
it hath no Outworks, neither doth it need any,
because of the Marais on that side where it may
most easily be attacked: it stands on a Rock, but
though the most important place of the King∣dom,
<PB N="223" REF="116"/>
and the only one that can hinder the
<HI>French</HI> from marching to <HI>Madrid,</HI> after they
have passed the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> it is not well looked
after. The works in many places want repara∣tions,
and the Garrison is very inconsiderable,
there being few Souldiers, for want of which
the Country people are to come in on the first
summons: of whom they then had sent for a
good number, and mixed them with the Soul∣diers,
that we might not perceive that want:
but we could easily distinguish, so little had they
the meen of Sword-men, some of them not
wearing any, and parading with a Musket only,
or an old Pike, which they handled so ill, it ap∣peared
they were more accustomed to the Pitch∣fork.
The Body of the place is well designed,
for in the middle of the Bracks where the Soul∣diers
lodge, there is a great round place to draw
up in Battaglia, from whence by five broad streets
they may march streight to the five Bastions.</P>
<P>They shewed us the Magazins not very well
furnished either with ammunition or victual, and
a very fair Towr built to keep powder, of which
it is altogether unprovided, and serves for a pri∣son
for greatest Criminals; they shewed a very
fine Handmill for turning which they may also
make use of horses. It is the best Engin in its
kind that I have seen, it hath 4 or 5 Wheels and
as many Bins, in each of which they said they
could in one day grind 24 load of Corn: but this
I thought impossible. I told them that so great a
Body composed of so many different pieces,
could hardly move long without being disor∣dered,
<PB N="224" REF="117"/>
and consequently uselese, and that unless
the Artist that made it lasted as long as the Mill,
nothing amiss in it could be amended, because
I took it to be a particular invention, and that
none but himself knew the Fabrick, and all the
Springs, so as to set them right when broken;
but they replied they successivly kept one that
understood it, who, that they might never be de∣stitute,
still taught some Apprentice. Here are
two or three Ponds, as they say, derived from
Springs. There were not many Sentries on the
Rampart, nor at the Canon. It hath a particu∣lar
Governor, that immediately depends on the
King: He was absent, but we were very civily
received by his Lieutenant, who after he had
led us about the Walls gave us a Collation; his
frankness pleased us, and we perceived that as
by degrees we got farther from the Gravity of
<HI>Castile,</HI> and severity of <HI>Arragon,</HI> as little open
to one another as to Strangers, we approached
a more sociable Country.</P>
<P>Nothing else being to be seen in the Castle,
that we might not trespass on the Lieutenants
civility, nor tire that of the Viceroys Captain of
his Gard, we took leave of the first, expressing
our satisfaction in his reception, and went
with the other to our Coach. Next day we
returned thanks to the Viceroy, and finding him
at leisure, had opportunity to discourse with
him more particularly than at our first visit. Be∣ing
a knowing person, and one of the Councils
of State and Warre, he presently fell upon the
<PB N="225" REF="117"/>
Government of the Low-Countries, making it
appear he understood those affairs very well.
He told us afterwards that the Earl of <HI>Pigne∣randa</HI>
was his near Kinsman, and we could do no
less than express the esteem we had for so ac∣complished
a person one of the ablest Ministers
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to whom we had especially been
recommended; so we took our leaves. The
15th in the Morning when we were about to take
horse, that we might get that night to the last
Village of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Dominions in the
upper <HI>Navarre,</HI> a Servant of the Viceroys Cap∣tain
of his Guards came to enquire, if his Ma∣sters
Gloves, which he thought he left in our
Chamber the day before, had been found: we
ordered search to be made every where, and sent
him with my Lord—s <HI>valet de Chambre;</HI>
but having long looked for what had never been
lost he went away, and by his meen and com∣portment
made us well enough comprehend, he
came not on that account, but to try, if we would
send him some pairs of those perfumed ones we
had in our Valises, and that were mentioned in
our Passes: but none being deafer than they
which will not hear, we let him go, without
seeming to understand him. But this served not
our turn; for thinking we were not ingenious
enough to do so, he sent back his man with a very
bad compliment, in plain terms to beg <HI>de los no∣stros
guantes de Ambar.</HI> We were amazed at this,
and our Valises being on the Horses, and our
selves ready to mount, let him see how trouble∣some
it would be to take them off, and open
<PB N="226" REF="118"/>
them, but that if he pleased we would write to
our Merchant in <HI>Madrid</HI> to send him as many
pair as he desired. We thus freed our selves
with all dexterity possible, not thinking we had
done any thing contrary to civility, since he that
demands too boldly, and without consideration,
ought to take to himself the greatest part of the
shame of a refusal Having thus got out of <HI>Pam∣pelone,</HI>
we took the great Road of the <HI>Pyreneans</HI>
that leads to <HI>France.</HI> We were not far from the
Town ere we began to ascend a hill, and before
we came to the next Village met some Souldiers
that belonged to the Garrison of the Castle,
who begged, which surprised me, for though the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> wants money, yet he never med∣dles
with the forty thousand Crowns they say the
Kingdom of <HI>Navarre</HI> brings up, and I have been
assured that all that is levied, though it exceed
the sum I have spoken of, remains in the Coun∣try
to pay the Viceroy, who hath a Salary of 10
thousand Crowns (though he of <HI>Arragon</HI> hath
but six) for the entertainments of a President and
six Counsellors, and maintaining his Forts and
Garisons.</P>
<P>They which know this kingdom, averr that
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> receives no advantage from
it, besides the securing and extending his fron∣tiers,
even to the Pyreneans, the true and na∣tural
barricade God hath placed between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain:</HI> yet were the Taxes levied here as
in <HI>Castille,</HI> he might draw something. But
the priviledges the people of <HI>Navarre</HI> reser∣ved
to themselves, and the consideration that
<PB N="227" REF="118"/>
if they should rebel, they might possibly re∣turn
to the obedience of their natural Prince,
for whom yet they have inclinations,
son is the reason they are not pressed with
Taxes; so that the certainest Leavies for sup∣port
of the publick charge come from the Cu∣stome,
and are reported to be 24 thousand
Crowns; but the avarice and deceit of those
that finger the Money, raised there for main∣taining
the Garisons that ought to be better
paid then any others in <HI>Spain,</HI> reduce the poor
soldiers to beggery, and cause the Kings ser∣vice
to be so much neglected, that were an
Army sent thither, it would probably make ve∣ry
great progression. It is true, that if we except
the inconveniences they would give the King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> there is not expectation enough of
advantages from that Quarter to cause the
best Troops to be sent thither, which might
more profitably be imployed in <HI>Flanders, Mi∣lan,</HI>
or <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>Before our arrival at <HI>Burguette,</HI> we rather
baited then dined at a pitiful village, where
the Guardian looked on our Passes with a great
deal of civility, and discoursed with us of the
times in which he had served in <HI>Flanders</HI> un-Marquis
<HI>Spinola.</HI> Having traversed Woods, Hills,
and Valleys with sometimes good sometimes bad
way; we arrived in the evening at the Plain of
<HI>Roncevalles,</HI> famous for the great battle <HI>Charle∣main,</HI>
fought, and lost in it, against the Sarazens.
My Lords—and—spurring on, got
to <HI>Burguette</HI> before it was dark: They had much
<PB N="228" REF="119"/>
ado to find lodging, and were fain to adress
themselves to the Justice, who ordered them
to be entertained in the house where we pas∣sed
the night. The next day being the 6th of
<HI>Iuly,</HI> without much suffering by heat in so wide
a Plain, encompassed by the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> we tra∣versed
it, and by some Merchants of <HI>Oleron</HI> that
often pass it, were shewed the place where the
battle was fought; here said they <HI>Roland</HI> was
killed, notwithstanding the force of his Lance;
where this Cross stands, died the brave <HI>Renaldo,</HI>
and had we been curious of all that tradition,
true or false, had taught them, I believe they
would have pointed out to us where every one
of the 12 Peers of <HI>France</HI> fell, and perhaps
have shewed us some of their blood, for that
of <HI>Hero</HI>'s never perishes, and they went about
to perswade us, that one place is still Red with
it; but we, whose curiosity never went so
low as to busie it self about dumb objects, look∣ed
on those things only as we passed by, and
went not a step out of our way to taste the air
where they said so great persons had rendred,
or vomited, the prodigious souls that ani∣mated
bodies ranked amongst the antient Gi∣ants.
Spurred on by impatience to be quickly
beyond the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> we hasted over this Ro∣mantick
or Historical Valley; Coming to the
end of it, we found a Mountain, to whom it
gives the name of <HI>Roncevalles;</HI> we were told
this was the highest of the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> yet there
was no snow on the top of it, though most of
the other on our right hand had hoary heads;
<PB N="229" REF="119"/>
but notwithstanding this, it seemed to approach
nearer Heaven then those that wore its Livery;
and that it changed colour betimes, and in the
beginning of the Summer, by reason of the seas
neighbourhood; the acrimony of whose vapors
aids to melt and dissipate its snow sooner then
that of such as are more remote. When we
were at the heighth of the Mountain of <HI>Ron∣cevalles,
Egregia contemplatione pavimus animum;</HI>
and we paused to consider, on the one hand
<HI>Spain,</HI> that we had just then abandoned, and on
the other <HI>France,</HI> which we were about to en∣ter.
The first seemed a scorched Campania,
where the bald Mountains discovered only na∣ked
Rocks, and concealed few Plains or Vallies
that bore grass, or any thing else that is useful.
The later on the contrary presented us a Gar∣den,
where Nature had disposed eminencies and
depressions, Plains, Hills, Woods, and Valleys,
to boast variety on a fair Theater of universal
fertility, so plentiully sowed, that the Land we
saw, though none of the best of <HI>France,</HI> was
surprizingly delightful, as soon as compared
with that we had left. To conclude, without
hyperbole or exaggeration, and in a plain man∣ner
of describing things as they really are, I
must declare, that contemplating two so differ∣ent
objects; me thought that in the one the day
of judgement would find little unburnt; and
that in the other▪ the flames which shall cele∣brate
the worlds Funeral, would be last extin∣guished,
because it seemed the fire of Heaven
had already fallen on the first, and almost rost∣ed
<PB N="230" REF="120"/>
it; and that to the other, it had imparted
only a cherishing warmth to animate it: and
the <HI>Italian</HI> perhaps had reason, who vexed at
the Doctors that disputed about the seat of Pur∣gatory,
said, he wondred men of learning
should be so ignorant, for had they understood
Maps, they would have placed that of <HI>Europe</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> and that of <HI>Africk</HI> in <HI>Lybia.</HI> I shall
not determine whither he spoke sense, or raved,
but only add, that what I have said of the dif∣ference
of these two prospects; takes not off
my esteem for <HI>Spain,</HI> nor hinders my admi∣ring
the wisdom, temperance, prudence, and o∣ther
moral and political virtues, that are emi∣nent
in the greatest part of the men it produ∣ces:
it is not therefore out of contempt of the
one, or too elevated an <HI>Idea</HI> of the other,
that I register the difference I observed: I know
very well that the fattest soils are not ever most
beneficial, neither do they always produce the
greatest personages. The ablest of all the Gre∣cians
was born amongst the rocks of <HI>Ithaca;</HI>
and in <HI>Provence</HI> there is a certain nook, called
<HI>la Crau,</HI> covered with Flint, whith its Lord will
not exchange for any other that abounds with
Fruits and Flowers, because in that very seat
of barrenness there grows an herb of such vir∣tue,
that one twig of it is worth many handfuls
of those of the most luxurious meddows; this
makes appear, that fruits of perfectest savor
often abound in the defectiv'st foils, and that
though <HI>Spain</HI> be lean and dry, she is yet strong
and vigorous: and experience teaches, that the
<PB N="231" REF="120"/>
Spaniards are stouter and more capable of great
fatique, then such as are born in more pleasant
and plentiful Countreys, and even amongst
themselves, the most couragious Races flourish
amongst Rocks and Mountains, and in the sandiest
Provinces; the other being inhabited by per∣sons
neither of so warlike spirits, nor elevated
fancies, pusillanimity being almost always the
companion of fertility; and the Romans were
scarce ever more put to it, then in the conquest
of this nation; its invincible courage, the dif∣ficulty
of passage, scarsity of Provisions, and ex∣cess
of heat, predominating, almost through the
whole peninsula, resisted them Sixscore years;
neither could it in less time be overcome in our
age, were it still as populous as formerly.</P>
<P>But ere I give over, and that I may do <HI>Spain</HI>
right before I loose the sight of it; I must ob∣serve
that this sterility and penury objected a∣gainst
it, is not caused so much by the default
(if I may so speak) of the Countrey, as by that
of its inhabitants; were they more industrious,
and instead of feeding themselves with smoak
and vanity in their wretched Cabins, tilled bet∣ter
their Land, and contemned not mechanick
Arts, she would be a liberal mother of all things
necessary for life, whither to cloath or feed them,
and they might have Corn, Wine, Oyl, and
all manner of fruits, to suffice them, without
being beholding to their neighbors; and did
they understand Husbandry, or would apply
themselves to it, it would maintain them in
such abundance, that not only the more fertile
<PB N="232" REF="121"/>
Provinces would supply the sterility of some that
are barrener, but they might vent part to for∣rainers,
wools of <HI>Segovia,</HI> Silks of <HI>Grenada,</HI> Cor∣dovans
of <HI>Ciudad Rodrigo;</HI> the Flax and Hemp
of <HI>Andalusia;</HI> the Iron and Copper of <HI>Biscai,</HI>
with many other rich dispoils of its Cattle, Land,
and Mines, might croud its Cities with Artifi∣cers,
and fill them with the best manufactures of
<HI>Europe;</HI> but they send these abroad unwrought,
which when Forrainers have metamorphosed
and disposed to humane use, part return to them
from those who double the money they first
paid for them.</P>
<P>I have now passed the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> and top of
the high mountain that separates <HI>France</HI> from
<HI>Spain,</HI> and whilst I contemplated those two
great Kingdoms, having ventured to compare
their Climates, and contract as in one mass all
the remarks of my journey; I will conclude by
setting against each other the customs and po∣liticks
of this neighbouring people; no less con∣trary
then the motions that cause fire to mount
and earth to descend. Whilst I stayed at <HI>Madrid</HI>
I used my utmost endeavor to discover; if the
antipathy reported to be so natural and recipro∣cal,
were really and substantially as strong as
it seems, and is imagined; but I found that the
contrariety attributed to their humors, and com∣portment,
whither publick or private, proceeds
rather from several tempers and Genius's, then
any true and real antipathy that renders the
French more incompatible with Spaniards, then
with Englishmen, Germans, Italians, or any o∣ther
<PB N="233" REF="121"/>
nations every one of which hath its parti∣cular
character and specifick impression, as well
in body as mind, which may (if I be permitted
the expression) be called its principle of distin∣ction.
If besides this common and general vari∣ety,
proceeding from the Air we first breath,
there be any more express and formal between
one people and another; it is caused by some
accidents, conjunctures or other circumstances,
which as to contempt and hatred have the same
influence on nations as on particular persons,
who (that excepted) have no more of contrari∣ety
then two Rivers that run different courses,
and ever follow their Channel with equal in∣clination,
though not always with the same im∣petuosity.
This granted, I averre, that besides
competition of power and State of Rivalship, in
which these people have so long continued, and
which have been animated by many wars and
differences not yet reconciled or ended, no an∣tipathy
can be observed between them, more
then each of them hath with all others: and
when these considerations have bern removed,
and the causes of aversion of State for State, and
publick animosities have ceased they have lived
as well one with another, as either of them hath
done with other forrainers. My self have seen
very many French inhabiting <HI>Madrid,</HI> and <HI>Sa∣ragossa,</HI>
who not concerning themselves in the
interest of their Countrey, agree very well with
the Spaniards; and the Catalonians and Portu∣gueses
give convincing testimonies of this ve∣rity▪
All the world knows that these renoun∣cing
<PB N="234" REF="122"/>
the Catholick Kings Dominion, and abju∣ring,
with the fealty they owed him, all the mi∣steries
of the Spanish Monarchy, there followed
so great confidence and correspondence between
them and <HI>France,</HI> that notwithstanding diffe∣rence
of humors, they have reciprocally been as
well received and looked upon at <HI>Paris</HI> and
<HI>Lisbon</HI> as they could be at <HI>Stockholme</HI> or <HI>War∣sovia,</HI>
where I suppose no man will imagin any
antipathy for either of them: the former of
these wheeled a little more, and cast themselves
into the arms of <HI>France,</HI> the difference of cu∣stomes
and inclinations not preventing their
corresponding as well as <HI>Spaniards, Neapolitans</HI>
and <HI>Flemings.</HI> It is only since that emulation of
glory, which beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n with the advancement of
the Spanish Empire under <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> increased
under the <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, and continued un∣der
his Successors, that these people cannot
brook one another either in publick or particu∣lar,
and that have added to the difference of
their tempers and natures, a spirit of envy, ha∣tred,
and contempt, which make them incom∣patible.
For one of them is not only reserved
and speculative, but impatient of the gay and
sociable humor of the other; one of them is
not only slow and dilatory, but cannot suffer the
others activity and brisk temper; one of them
is not only satisfied to walk as if he counted his
steps, but cannot abide the others negligent and
interrupted gate: one of them does not only
salute by leaning backwards, but scoffs at the o∣ther
when he bows to do it. In a word one of
<PB N="235" REF="122"/>
them hath neither humor nor custom that dis∣pleases
not the other, and which he blames not
out of the principles of jealousie and ambition I
have formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>These different qualities caused and height∣ened
by that emulation of grandeur, and thirst
of precedence, that hath so long tormented them,
and cost Christendom so much blood, are the
sourses of the diversity of their Politicks. Not∣withstanding
all which one of them sometimes
borrows something of the nature and qualities
of the other, and imitates some of its most sub∣til
tracings; but the hand and pencil ever differ:
neither is it possible so to settle other mens
clothes on our own backs, that it will not be dis∣covered
they were not made for us. There is
ever something in their manner of acting, which
makes apparent its principles are no more the
same then its agents. They which have read
the famous contest between Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth
and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and observed the forms and
ends of those great Potentates, for glory and
interest, may find a manifest proof of this verity.
It is most certain that in their Politicks they
now and then tread in one anothers footsteps;
but it is more so, that their pace is never equal
which way soever they go. <HI>Spain</HI> is represent∣ed
in a Chariot, seated on a Throne of Tortois-shell,
drawn by Remora's, who in tedious tra∣versing
vast spaces of time, lose many opportu∣nities:
yet her extraordinary patience and close
application to the game, with her skill in pack∣ing
the Cards, oftentimes disturbs the designes of
<PB N="236" REF="123"/>
the craftiest Gamesters. When at more violent
exercises she never stumbles by too much haste,
she waits the rebound of the ball, and if she
misses it, is satisfied to have judged it well, and
not to have lost her stroke by precipitation, and
giving it before it came to ground. By a vast
speculation she embraces the whole extent of
an object, discovers the most minute parts of it,
all its joynts and muscles; and if she makes not
her self Mistress of it, it is never because she
mistook the most advantageous part of lay hold
on, but because too intent in studying the hour
and moment, which either passes over, or is
snatched away whilst she waits for it, or delibe∣rates
on it.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged that this misfortune
doth not often happen to her in her Council-Chamber,
nor in such affairs as depend on ne∣gotiations
only. Of all parts of the art of go∣verning
she succeeds best in this, where her con∣siderations
fixed on all circumstances are very
happy, here she makes appear the ingenious
Fabrick of those artificial Springs which give
motion to a slow and circumspect proceeding,
that secures her of a good effect in what ever
she hath leisure and time to manage. But in the
field, and affairs of warre, where she hath nei∣ther
time nor liberty to comply with a long and
mature deliberation, such occasions as can∣not
easily suffer this, and where oppor∣tunity
must be anticipated, and more usually
left to hazard and fortune, than to prudence and
reason, she hath not the like advantage, and of∣ten
<PB N="237" REF="123"/>
comes so short in her reckoning, that she
sees her most important designes perish because
begun too late, and her self deceived in the hour
she destined for their bringing forth. I will
not be busie about examples of this truth; for,
besides the Siege of <HI>Mastricht,</HI> (the opportuni∣ty
of raising which she lost by delaying to un∣dertake
it as soon as it was begun, and where
she pretended so much to force and Council, that
she at last employed neither the one nor the o∣ther,
but in order to receiving a more publick
affront) the late warrs might furnish us testimo∣nies
so well known to all the world, that it were
to no purpose to insert them here.</P>
<P>But I will add that this gravity, and two great
circumspection, which sometimes makes the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> fall by endeavouring to fix their feet
more steadily, is in a manner recompensed by a
very considerable quality, which is an extraor∣dinary
constancy after misfortunes that have
been almost destructive to her, and an incessant
perseverance with indefatigable vigor to pursue
all advantages after good success. If we consider
the rude trials of this to which she hath been
exposed by insurrections of so many people, re∣volt
of one of her richest Provinces, and separa∣tion
of a Kingdom; if we observe the great
shocks she hath received both by land and sea,
from the Armies of so many Princes allied a∣gainst
her, and examine the many Battails she
hath lost, we shall find cause enough of admira∣tion
that she is still on her feet, and that it is a
grandeur altogether peculiar to that Nation, to
<PB N="238" REF="124"/>
endure, so much without fainting, and that no
other stomach could digest so many hard mor∣sel
without loss of appetite: that any thing of
which remains is alone to be imputed to that
gentle and natural heat which acts without pre∣cipitation,
and suffers without alteration what
it can neither concoct nor evacuate, casting it
on time and a more favourable conjuncture:
I mean that her policies are so pliable and con∣stant,
that if her expedients and power often
fail, her heart never does so, though contem∣plating
her condition, she hath nothing many
times to comfort her, but patience, and such o∣ther
vertues as she ever makes use of both in
Field and Cabinet, how low soever. Neither
hath she been wont to give ove a loser, how
unfortunate soever, seldom abandoning the gave
and hope of revenge. Though she lately con∣sented
to the liberty of the United Provinces,
and renounced her right to dispute it, it was not
till after a war of fourscore years, nor without
that absolute necessity which obliges of two evils
to choose the least, so that we cannot inferre
from it she was sick at heart, nor that she often
regorges what she hath once swallowed. And
perhaps if she ever disengages her self from the
many tyes that restrain her, and gets leisure to
make a free use of her power and wisdom, it will
appear she laied not aside the Cards, but because
she had too many Gamesters upon her hand, and
that she will reassume them with this protestati∣on,
that there is no prescription to Soveraigns;
and that the solemnest Othes, if contrary to
<PB N="239" REF="124"/>
those of their Coronation oblige them not, and
that there may as well happen to them as to the
honest Casuist, a certain apprehension that may
dispense with their making good their pro∣mise.</P>
<P>If we consider on the other side (to return to
what I have said of the equality of their vigour
in prosperity) how we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under∣stand
to make use of the favours of fortune, and
all their advantages, when heaven hath compli∣ed
with that circumspection and remote fore∣sight
according to which they act, we must needs
acknowledge all other policies come short of
theirs, being boldest, activest, and most vigilant
after good success, that best pursue the gain of
a battail, and carefullest secure a Town after its
surrender, that most aptly impose fetters on Peo∣ple
they have conquered, or reduced to their
ancient subjection, if straied from it; and that bet∣ter
than any other accommodate to their own
interests, those of the Princes allied with them;
(in a word) that after victory are more solicitous
to gather all the fruits that can be derived from
it, and draw all the good consequences it can
possibly afford. Others in prosperity languish,
and their industry stackens after conquest, chu∣sing
rather to enjoy the fruits of their good for∣tune,
than to make an advantageous use of it,
and to lose the honor and profit of their great∣est
actions, then not to repose and take breath
at the end of the course. Such politicks belong
only to those that have better arms then heads,
and that value not the Prise so much as the
<PB N="240" REF="125"/>
Race, nor Crowns and Triumphs as Battails and
Victories; I mean that preferre the way before
the end, and great actions above the felicities
they lead to.</P>
<P>To the two high advantages I have mention∣ed
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Politicks, derived from the
great circumspection that attends them, a third
may be added, which is that whensoever they
have any design in hand, they can so secretly
give it maturity, that nothing is discovered of it
till at once it surprises and ashonishes. They
work under ground, and with much care that
nothing of their design takes vent, least which
may be discovered by their meen &amp; countenance
they counterfeit sleep when most awake, at Sen∣try,
and ready to discharge, and (though at other
times very jealous of reputation) are not then
displeased to have their power decried, nor to
be accused of weakness, that such erroneous
judgment may cause their enemies so much to
neglect standing on their Gard, they may take
them unprovided and overthrow those that think
them to be in a condition neither to attacque, nor
defend themselves. Shadowed by such secresie,
and secured by such artifice, they have some∣times
very sodainly advanced, and passing by
the conquest of all <HI>Sicilia,</HI> it is known that in
our daies they have successfully done this, and
when least apprehended appeared before <HI>Tarra∣gon</HI>
and <HI>Lerida</HI> with more forces then they were
thought to be Masters of. In a word they have
ever been secret to admiration and so excellent∣ly
practised in that politick dissimulation, so use∣full
<PB N="241" REF="125"/>
in governing, and that can so well aid it
self with disguise, that they have often by it ob∣tained
such effects, as by force they could never
have arrived at. And when these little Max∣ims
fail of success in warr, they have recourse
to Treaties and Conferences, where they so
dexterously make use of them, that in one ma∣ner
or other they gain all advantages can be ex∣pected
from them. On account of which I must
needs take notice, that they obtain the better
in Negotiations, by means alone of that flegma∣tick
and extraordinary patience, that tires and
quenches the heat of other people, leading
them about through so many labyrinths, that at
last weary of conferring so long, and concluding
nothing, they comply with part of what is de∣sired,
and perhaps in conclusion yield to the rest,
so to purchase that repose <HI>Spain</HI> seems so un∣willing
to grant them, because sensible of their
weakness, and that they pursue with impatience
whatsoever they have once hoped for.</P>
<P>Thus by a judicious obstinacy they oftentimes
overcome the greatest opposition against what
they design, and by compliance possess them∣selves
of what they cannot obtain by contesta∣tion.</P>
<P>But to stay no longer on consideration of Po∣licies
that have within themselves turnings and
windings very particular, I will only add that it
is conceived something might be amended in
their Catholicon, I mean in that excess of zeal,
real or pretended, they make appear in matters
of Religion. It is very evident that this fire
<PB N="242" REF="126"/>
sometimes warms <HI>Spain</HI> to its prejudice, and may
sooner consume her, than convince those she
would by it win to her interests: And no less
known that the Popes are not kinder to her on
this account, but suspect her passion for the
Church of an humane infirmity, that stretches
toward heaven only to grow higher upon earth:
and that she gains no friends intirely, but a
share only of their inclinations, by those wayes
that make her real enemies, that have a perfect
hatred and aversion for her. In a word her con∣stant
designe, and to which she seems engaged
as by oath not to suffer Protestants in her Do∣minions,
and to persecute them in their own, is
a state secret that hath been so well examined
by Catholicks, that its true price and value is
sufficiently understood by them, and no less by
those against whom it is directed, which causes
them to apprehend, that on such specious
principles, she engages to their ruine, to satisfie
her ambition, and that high aim of which she
is accused, by uniting in one body so many dif∣ferent
Dominions, to become head of Christen∣dom.
In the mean time the present composure
of <HI>Europe,</HI> and form of the establishment of
Christianity considered, she ought to cast off this
thought, and recollect that the two parties into
which it is divided, are almost equal, and if they
should come to a shock with the Body of their
Forces, victory would a long time hover incer∣tain
which side to take, and perhaps not hers,
though seconded by all the Roman Legions.
She ought to understand her <HI>Catholicon</HI> to be but
<PB N="243" REF="126"/>
a thin visard to her <HI>Ragione di stato</HI> that it hath
often discovered the secret, which hath been
known every where; and to examine how small
the advantages are of following Maxims that ex∣asperate
one party, and gain not the other. My
meaning, is she should confine her self within the
limits of temporal interest, without mixing Re∣ligion
with it, which descended not from heaven
to destroy Society, and that it will nothing avail
her to make so many signes of the cross, against
Protestants. Let her therefore permit them to
live, and living with them make them under∣stand,
she hath absolved her self from that vow
(at least if there were any such) which obliged
her on all occasions to endeavour their destru∣ction
and that of their Church. From such a
change of conduct she would derive two great
advantages, for she would be more considerable
at <HI>Rome</HI> by seeming less attached to the interests
of that Court, and more redoubted by <HI>France,</HI>
by diverting part of the inclination of those of
the Reformed Religion, which it believes it self
alone possesses, with exclusion of all other Ca∣tholick
Princes, never giving testimonies of open
hatred, nor persecuting with fire and fagot, that
which ought to be the object only of prayer and
perswasion.</P>
<P>Having drawn some lines of the nature and
qualities of the Spanish policies, it remains that I
give such a draught of those of the French, as
may discover part of their extent and Forces, that
by comparing them we may judge which is like∣ly
to get the better of its rival: The later are
<PB N="244" REF="127"/>
so variable, and of a form so transient, that
hours and moments, which ever fly, have no
swifter revolution; and the former are as con∣trary,
and appropriated to fixation; it is very
difficult to paint the one because of the rapidity
of its course, and no less so to determine which
of the two is more potent, by reason of the
continual conflict they have so long strugled in,
without yielding on either side. One would
think they had divided between them all the
skill of the Fencing-school, and that the one
comes on with better grace, and hath its arm
more supple, but that the other reaches farther,
and makes its thrust more home: Thus Heaven
to preserve the power of these Nations near an
equality, hath opposed to the vivacity and spirit
of one of them the prudence and constancy of
the other, that what the last comes short in a∣gility,
may be recompensed by its attention to
all it undertakes; and what the first wants of
circumspection and patience may be supplied by
incredible diligence.</P>
<P>It is yet probable that the <HI>French</HI> fire so allay∣ed,
as not to dasle the judgment, produces grea∣ter
effects than the <HI>Spanish</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eam, how conside∣rable
soever. It is capable of all that is Heroick
even to miracle, it forces an alteration in the
face of affairs, and chains fortune and victory to
attend its banners; when they seem inclining to
forsake it. It is as quick in discovering and pre∣venting
mischiefs as in applying remedies to
those that surprise it. Its eye, hand, and heart
are continually directed to what may help or
<PB N="245" REF="127"/>
hurt it; the first is usefull to embrace or avoid,
the second to seise whatever is advantagious, and
repel all that may be fatal, whilst the last ani∣mates
to support all burthens, and often attains
what its strength could not extend to, whilst
with all three it on one side levels a way for mis∣fortune,
and banishes it, and on the other opens
a door to success and meets it: Whereas the
profound intellect of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by means of
frosty irresolution and tedious deliberation, suf∣fers
the fruits of its best Enterprises to be nipt in
the blossom, because not so diligent to execute
as subtle to invent them. I could draw examples
from our present times conclusive enough of this
truth, if I were not desirous to make an end. I
will therefore only add that that I am not un∣sensible,
that the <HI>French</HI> airiness often causes
their designes to miscarry, that their diligence
is not alwayes joyned with prudence, and that
it sometimes hastens with so little discourse and
reflexion, it observes nothing, and as if it had
no other members but hands and feet, violently
plunges into confusion, and falls headlong into
misfortune, by reason of that precipitation which
often astonishes, and puts it besides it self, so
much that its great courage abandoning it, it
retreats in disorder. The reproach of this is ne∣vertheless
much out of date, by reason of ma∣ny
modern great and couragious actions and en∣terprises,
where it hath made appear a diligence
in executions, as little destitute of judgement
as courage.</P>
<P>This was long ago, when experience had not
<PB N="246" REF="128"/>
purified their fire, nor moderated that excess
of it which made them begin well and end ill,
on which account all they did was attributed to
furie and a blind transport, that after the first
attempt was changed into fear: but they are
no more the same men, neither, after going on
like Lions, do they come off like Hares; and
when their enterprises fail of success, they ma∣ny
times retreat with honor, and without con∣fusion.
And certainly the greatest promptitude
when accompanied by reason and judgement is
as often the Mother as Stepdame of good for∣tune.
<HI>Alexander</HI> conquered all because he would
leave nothing for the morrow; and <HI>Caesar</HI> al∣lowed
but a moment between deliberation and
action, apprehending that either the greatness
of the design might discourage it, or the oppor∣tunity
be passed if he took time to examine it:
but as the celerity of these two Heroes was ever
fortunate, by reason of their prodigious Capa∣cities
in all they undertook, and the circumspe∣ction
and delays of <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> and the
great <HI>Gonsalvo</HI> re-established Empire, and con∣quered
Kingdoms, we may say that each of these
Nations, according as their predominant humor
is allaied by prudence, and illuminated by rea∣son,
can disgest the toughest morsels, and diffi∣cultest
thwartings of fortune, though one of
them hath defects of stomach, that sometimes
cause vomitings, and the other is now and then
afflicted with megrims that oblige it to repose.
<HI>Augustus</HI> had felt the pulse of both of them
when he pronounced his <HI>Festina lente:</HI> and we
<PB N="247" REF="128"/>
may infallibly conclude that a third Constituti∣on
participating of the <HI>French</HI> promptitude and
<HI>Spanish</HI> solidity, were alone capable not only
of conquering the World but governing it. And
a great and wise Frenchman having owned
<HI>l interest d' Angleterre estant bien suivi establira
dans la Chretientè vne troisiem puissance:</HI> that
<HI>England</HI> pursuing her true interest will become
a third Power, equal to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> (and
this meant in regard of her scituation &amp; strength
alone) I think I may modestly enough add, that
the equality and harmony of her temper (which
neither heavily slumbers away opportunities,
nor rashly snatches at them before maturity)
considered, did not some mistaken principles,
introduced by a fond doting on such a liberty as
is inconsistent with Government, make the sub∣ordinate
wheels too heavy, and the Spring (that
is the supreme power) too weak to produce re∣gular
and vigorous motions in them, by a per∣fect
submission to her Soveraign, she might un∣der
his conduct be able to make a farther progres∣sion
towards giving laws to mankind than any
other people ever arrived at.</P>
