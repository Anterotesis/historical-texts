<HEAD>Good News from the English Fleet: Being an ACCOUNT OF A <HI>Great &amp; Bloody Engagement</HI> Which hapned Yesterday, betwixt Their Majesties Fleet, Commanded by the Earl of Torrington, <HI>And the French Fleet.</HI> Near the <HI>BEACHY,</HI> upon The Coast of Sussex.</HEAD>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">With a Particular Relation of the Blowing-up of Six of the Biggest of the <HI>FRENCH</HI> Men of War; The Breaking the Lines of the <HI>FRENCH;</HI> And several other Occurrences.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday the 23th. in∣stant, the Earl of <HI>Tor∣rington</HI> Sailed with their Majesties Fleet from St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> and the <HI>Spithead;</HI> the Wind being at North-East, and stood to∣ward the <HI>French</HI> Fleet (which, as the Advice Boats brought an Ac∣count, lay at Anchor about two Leagues from Shore, off of <HI>Fresh∣water-gate</HI> in the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI>) with a Resolution to Fight the <HI>French;</HI> but the Witd coming about, and taking them short, he came to an Anchor, off of a place called <HI>Dun∣nose,</HI> which is within Five Leagues, or Fifteen English Miles, of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, who were removed, and were at Auchor in <HI>Compton-Bay.</HI> The next day, being Tues∣day, about Three in the Morning, there came up with us, and joyned our Fleet, several Men of War, <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English;</HI> and in the E∣vening, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral <HI>Evertz∣zen,</HI> in a Ship of Ninety delicate Brass Guns, with Two <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War more, one of which was a Rear Admiral. Also their Ma∣jesties Ships, the <HI>Lyon</HI> and <HI>Con∣stant Warwick,</HI> all joyned our Fleet.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, about Five in the Morning, our Admiral, the Earl of <HI>Torrington,</HI> stood to the Westward, the Wind at South and by East, with a Windward Tide; and about Noon they were with∣in fight of <HI>Dunnose Point,</HI> about Four Leagues from the Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Fleet stood at the same time to the East-ward, being
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>at the like distance from the Shore; and about Three of the Clock in the Afternoon, the two Fleets were within a little above a League of each other; so that it was verily expected an Engagement would immediately ensue, by the Dispo∣sition of the <HI>French</HI> in their seem∣ing to meet us; but on a sudden, the Admiral of the <HI>French</HI> Ordered a Gun to be Fired, and Tacqued about, and the rest of the Fleet stood after and followed him; who steered directly West-ward, and from us. Our Fleet follow'd them till Night, but we could not reach them near enough to Engage.</P>
<P>The next day being Thursday the 26th. the <HI>French</HI> Fleet came to an Anchor, on the South side of the <HI>Isle of Wight.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday there arose so great a Mist and Fog, that both the Fleets continued at Anchor.</P>
<P>Nothing of moment happened on Saturday.</P>
<P>On Sunday, being the 29th. in the Morning, there joyn'd our Ad∣miral, Their Majesties Ships the <HI>Mil∣ford</HI> and <HI>Garland,</HI> and a Dutch Man of War of 72 Guns. And in the Afternoon, our Advice-Boats brought Word, That the <HI>French</HI> Fleet had weighed Anchor, and were put to Sea; upon which, our Fleet weighed likewise, and made towards the <HI>French,</HI> who steered their Course as if they had endea∣voured to get the Wind of us, or rather to avoid Fighting, and make for their own Coast, would the Wind have permitted them.</P>
<P>And Yesterday, being Monday, (the 30th. Instant) about Eight in the Morning, our Fleet came up with the <HI>French</HI> (who steered East∣ward) early in the Morning, near the. <HI>Beechy,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Sussex,</HI> about Three Leagues off of the Shoar: And the two Fleets being drawn up into Lines, in order of Battel, ours in the Form of a Half-Moon, immediately the two Ad∣mirals advanced at the Head of their Squadrons; and several S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots be∣exchanged by each Fleet's Defiance-Frigats and Advice-Boats, about Ten a Clock a most furious and bloody Fight ensued between both Fleets, engaging Board and Board; which though it continued, till Night put an end, yet 'tis obser∣vable, That after a few Hours, we took the Lines of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and put them into great Confusi∣on. They Fought retreating for several Hours before Night, and tis thought this Morning our Fleet has engaged them again, the Wind 'being still at East South East; so that they cannot well escape us, by making to any of their own Ports that can harbour them, the nearest <HI>French</HI> Ports being <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Calice,</HI> neither of which can har∣bour their great Men of War, by reason of the shallowness of the waters, that they cannot get over the Bars: So that we Doubt not, but our Fleet (by the Blessing of GOD) will destroy most of the <HI>French,</HI> before we let them go off from the <HI>English</HI> Coast.</P>
<P>The particulars of this Engage∣ment, also what Ships we have Taken, Sunk, and Men Killed, is expected with grert impatience: But several Gentlemen from the Hills of <HI>Sussex,</HI> with their Tele∣scopes, affirm, that they saw Six large Ships of the <HI>French</HI> on Fire, one of which being the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> a Ship of 110 Brass Guns; on Board of which was their Grand Admiral M. <HI>Turville.</HI></P>
<P>And thus we see how the great Monarch of the Universe, and So∣veraign Disposer of all Sublunary things, is graciously pleas'd to bless their Majesties Armes, as well by Sea as Land; to be, in so great a measure, instrumental in pulling down the <HI>French</HI> Tyrant, who has arrived to that pitch of Pride and Vain glory (like the great Tyrant in the Gospel) that neither fear'd G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, nor regarded Man.</P>
