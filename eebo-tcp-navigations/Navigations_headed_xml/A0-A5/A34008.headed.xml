<P>THe Author of this

continued nine years in an

<P>His Genius led him to be
curious and inquisitive,

that were difficult to be at∣tained
to; and perhaps he
found the means of gather∣ing
these few Papers toge∣ther,
as hard and uneasie as
any thing that he endea∣voured
after in all his Tra∣vels.</P>
<P>He had the happiness to
be a Favourite to the Great

<HEAD>A
SURVEY
Of the present State of
RUSSIA,</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Russians</HI> nature in general, their con∣tempt
of Learning, their Clergy, Litur∣gy,
Churches, Ceremonies in Devotion,
hours of Prayer, the Priests names, Ha∣bit,
Wives, Baptism: The unnatural
death of Apostates.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S for the Situtaion of <HI>Russia;</HI>
it is so well known, that it
would be a needless labour
for me to set it down; my
design at present is to Survey
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Religion and Manners of the Inhabi∣tants.
And to this purpose, I have made a
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
slender Essay, the truth whereof, I hope,
will excuse the plainness of the dress;
the stuff is course, and the thread not
fine▪ but the matter I conceive will be
both pleasant and profitable. Having
had therefore fair opportunities, and
good intelligence, I am the more wil∣ling
to give you an account of this Em∣pire.
Indeed, hitherto no man of parts
or abilities has been suffered to travel the
Country. For the people are very jea∣lous,
and suspect those who ask them
any questions concerning their Policy,
or Religion, they being wholly devoted
to their own Ignorance, and Education;
(which is altogether illiterate, and rude,
both in Civil and Ecclesiastical Affairs)
look upon Learning as a Monster, and
fear it no less than a Ship of Wildfire;
and thus they verifie the old Saying,
<HI>Ars nullum habet inimicum praeter igno∣rantem.</HI></P>
<P>In the year of our Lord, 1560. the
Art of Printing was brought in amongst
them (as <HI>Thevet</HI> relates in the life of <HI>Ba∣sil)</HI>
and a Latin School also was erected,
but the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> soon destroyed it,
<HI>Vi &amp; Armis.</HI> I shall therefore com∣mence
<PB N="3" REF="14" MS="y"/>
my discourse with them, who
are not set apart for this Function, as in
other Nations, but any Lay-man of a
good life and conversation may take up∣on
him the Priesthood.</P>
<P>This Nation received the Christian
Faith about six hundred years since, from
a certain Priest of <HI>Chioff,</HI> who is said to
cure one of the Dukes of <HI>Musco</HI> by
prayer, upon which Miracle he and all
his people were baptized. They bor∣row
their Liturgy from the Greek
Church, which is written in the Scla∣vonian
Language, and used in their de∣votion
with as much knowledge, as the
Latin amongst the Papists. They fol∣low
the Greeks, though lamely, in the
Architecture of their Churches, whose
chief ornaments are Images, adorned
with rich Stones and Pearls, wherein
they admit no Sculpture but only paint∣ing;
for they look upon the Romish
Statue-worship as Idolatry. They kneel
not in their devotions, but lie prostrate▪
and upon some great Vigils they stay all
night in their Churches, at certain
times prostrating and crossing them∣selves,
and knocking their heads against
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
the Ground. At certain Intervals they
discourse of business, and most com∣monly
the Emperor dispatches the Af∣fairs
in the time of their Service, where
he is attended with all his Nobility;
and if he miss any, he makes inquiry af∣ter
them. At <HI>Whitsontide</HI> they fall pro∣strate
upon Sycamore branches (our
Maple, which they call Sycamore with
us, but falsely) wherewith their Chur∣ches
are strew'd, upon a fond perswasi∣on
that the holy Ghost descends upon
these leaves, as <HI>Manna</HI> upon Oake∣leaves.
They have no Instrumental Mu∣sick,
for the last Patriarch abrogated it,
because the Papists used it. In their
Prayers, three hours after Sun-rising,
they call <HI>Obedny,</HI> at Sun-set <HI>Vecherney;</HI>
about one a clock in the morning, <HI>Zaou∣trinys.
Miserere mei Domine</HI> (which they
call <HI>Hospody p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mele)</HI> they repeat an hun∣dred
times; and that Priest is counted
the best fellow that can mumble most in
a breath. You shall have five or six
reading confusedly together, one a Chap∣ter,
another a Psalm, a third a Pray∣er,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="15" MS="y"/>
A Parish-Priest they call a Pope; as
Pope <HI>Petro,</HI> Pope <HI>Iuan;</HI> a Bishop <HI>Me∣tropolite;</HI>
a chief Pope <HI>Protopope.</HI> The
Popes go most commonly in Purple,

distinguish'd with two flaps on both
sides their breast, and a purple Scul-cap
to cover their shaven crowns. They
never cut the hairs of their heads or
beards; a thing not observed by any
other Clergy in the world. A Pope
must be a married man, and the Husband
but of one Wife; grounded on that
Text, <HI>a Bishop must be the Husband of one
Wife.</HI> Hereby it appears, the Popes
Priesthood is wrapped up in his Wives
Smock; for when she dies he must offi∣ciate
no longer, which makes them in∣dulge
their Wives more then ordinary
for their Office sake. They marry young,
that they may come early into a liveli∣hood,
their Wives are also distinguish'd
from others by a flap on each side their
breast. Their Baptism differs not from
the Romish, but only in dipping all over.
He that takes up the Russian Faith, be
he Lutheran or Papist, must first re∣nounce
his former Baptism, curse Father
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
and Mother, and spit thrice over his
shoulder. It was a custom to hire
Strangers to christen the Russians, but now
they are grown wiser than to buy souls at
that rate. 'Tis observed by some old
Standers here, that of two hundred <HI>Eng∣lish,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Marriages are not very solemn;
a few attend the Bride about three
a clock in the afternoon, and at their
coming out of the Church, the <HI>Panna∣ma,</HI>
or Clerk, strews Hops upon the
Bride, and wishes her children as thick
as Hops; another with a Sheep-skin
coat turn'd outward meets her, and prays
she may have as many children as there
are hairs on his coat.</P>
<P>The Bridegroom is led home by
young Fellows, and the Bride (being
cover'd all over) by an old Woman, and
the Pope marches before with his Cross.
They sit a while down at Table with
Bread and Salt before them, but eat no∣thing;
In the mean time a Quire of Boys
and Girls standing aloft, sing <HI>Epithala∣miums,</HI>
or nuptial Songs, so bedawb'd
with scum of bawdry and obscenity, that
it would make <HI>Aretines</HI> ears glow to
hear them. After this they are conduct∣ed
by the Pope and Old-women to a
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
Room, where she advises the Bride to be
debonair and buxom, and exhorts the
Bridegroom to bestow due benevolence,
and here they are shut up for two hours;
the old Woman in the interim attends
for the tokens of Virginity, which ha∣ving
gotten, she goes triumphantly, and
demands <HI>Albricias</HI> of the Parents, first
tying up the Brides hair which before
hung over her ears. The married cou∣ple
must have no earth over their
heads (a Ceremony strictly observed, as
if mortality then ought not to be the
object of their meditations) for you must
know all warm Rooms are covered with
earth half a yard thick to keep in the
heat.</P>
<P>The Bridegroom has a Whip in one
Boot, and a Jewel or some Money in the
other, he bids the Bride pull them off,
if she happens upon the Jewel, he counts
her lucky, and bestows it upon her; but
if she lights upon the Boot with the
Whip in it, she is reckon'd amongst the
unfortunate, and gets a Bride-lash for
her pains, which is but the earnest-penny
of her future entertainment. The
Russians discipline to their Wives is very
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
rigid and severe, more inhumane in
times past then at present. Yet three
or four years ago a Merchant beat his
Wife as long as he was able, with a
Whip two inches about, and then cau∣sed
to put on a Smock dipt in Brandy
three or four times distilled, which he
set on fire, and so the poor creature pe∣rished
miserably in the flames: Cer∣tainly
this person was a Monster, not a
Man, born of a Tygress, not a Woman,
and in no wise deserved the Epithete
of good or wise. For the Heathens
themselves condemn such unchristian
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illany.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Hom. II.</BIBL><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
<P>And yet what is more strange, none
prosecuted her death; for in this case
they have no penal Law for killing of a
Wife or Slave, if it happen upon cor∣rection;
but it is a strange chastisement
to kill, seeing the design hereof was ne∣ver
intended to end people, but to mend
them. Some of these Barbarians will
tye up their Wives by the hair of the
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
head, and whip them stark naked. But
this severity is not commonly used, un∣less
it be for Adultery or Drunkenness:
And I perceive it begins to be left off, or
at least the Parents endeavour to pre∣vent
it, by their cautious contracting
their Daughters; For in their Joyntures
they oblige their Husbands to find them
with clothes suitable to their quality, to
feed them with good wholsom meat and
drink, to use them kindly without whip∣ping,
striking or kicking them, many
more terms and tautologies they use;
not unlike the Common Laws of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
Upon Forfeiture they put this in
execution, which is determin'd in one
Court, but not without bribery, as all
other Suites are. I wish the English
had more of the former (I mean their
expedition) and less of the latter, <HI>viz.</HI>
their corruption. Seldom a Wedding
passes without some Witch-craft (if
people of quality marry) chiefly acted
as 'tis thought by Nuns, whose prime
devotion tends that way. I saw a fel∣low
coming out of the Bride-chamber,
tearing his hair as though he had been
mad, and being demanded the reason
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
why he did so, he cry'd out: I am un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one:
I am bewitch'd: The remedy
they use, is to address themselves to a
white Witch, who for money will un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avel
the Charm, and untie the Cod∣piece-point,
which was this young mans
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase; it seems some old Woman had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed up his Codpiece-point. The Ec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesiastical

after four Girls together, 'tis thought
she would have been sent to her Devoti∣ons.
His Imperial Majesty intending to
marry, had divers young Ladies brought
before him, at last he liked one (which
they say is very beautiful still) but his
chief Confessor had a mind to perswade
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
him to another, who had an younger
Sister, so when this fair Lady was
brought, they found his Majesties incli∣nations
so strong for her, as they fear'd
she would get the Crown, and indeed
so she did; it being a Ceremony, upon
his liking, to tye the Crown upon her
head, but the plot was so laid, that the
Women should tye up her hair so hard
as to put her into a Swoon, which they
did, crying out she had the Falling-sick∣ness:
Upon this her Father was accused
of Treason for proposing his Daughter,
whip't, and sent with disgrace into <HI>Sybe∣ria,</HI>
where he died. The Maid remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

The Emperor being conscious of the
wrong: he had done her, allows her a ve∣ry
great Pension. The King's Father in
Law, <HI>Eliah</HI> the Son of <HI>Daniel,</HI> dares not
say the Empress is his Daughter, nor
dare any of her Kindred own themselves
to be so; non dare <HI>Iuan Paoloidg Mar∣tischca</HI>

only Relations may see young children
among the Russians, for they will seldom
permit any Strangers to look upon them,
for fear they should cast some ill aspect
upon them.</P>
<P>Their Children are commonly strong
and hardy, they give them suck not above
a month or two at the most; after which
they feed them with an Horn, or Silver
Cup made Horn-wise, with a dryed
Cows-dug tied to the small end, through
which they suck. At two years old
they observe their Fasts, which are se∣vere:
They have four in a year, and in
<HI>Lent,</HI> upon <HI>Wednesdayes, Fridays</HI> and <HI>Sa∣turdaies,</HI>
they eat no Fish, but feed on
Cabbage and Cucumbers, and course
Rye bread, and drink <HI>Caenasse,</HI> which is a
Liquor one degree below our small
Beer.</P>
<P>They will not drink after a man that
eats Flesh. If a Medicine has <HI>Cor. cer∣vi,
ungul. Al.</HI> or <HI>pil. lepor.</HI> in it, they
will not take it, though to save their
lives, so precise are they in observing
their Fasts: Their Pennance commonly
is so many bowings, and knockings of
their heads before an Image, and some∣times
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
to eat nothing but Bread and Salt
and Cucumbers, and to drink Water
for a season. That which is <HI>Poga∣no</HI>
(or unclean) may not be eaten at
any time; as Horse-flesh, Mares-milk,
Asses-milk, Hares, Squirrels, Coneys,
Elks: <HI>Theriaca</HI> or Treacle, is <HI>Pogano,</HI>
because it has Vipers flesh in it. <HI>Castori∣um,</HI>
Musk and Civet are not to be

or prohibited in Fasting-dayes; a Knife
that has cut Flesh is <HI>Scarumna</HI> for a

policy, as it happens, that they are so
strict, else the Flesh in the Country
would soon be destroyed; For the

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Patriarch is supream Head in all
Church-Affairs, highly honoured
by his Majesty: But upon some pett he
retired himself to his Countrey-house
about two years ago: Some say he be∣gan
to innovate certain things, or rather

After this manner.</P>
<P>The Emperour accompanied with all

with a rich embroyder'd Handkerchief
on his right Arm, then he goes to a
Church, called <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and by the
way prays at a place made up of Stone,
and round like a plate-form, here he
bows towards the East, and after enters
into the Church hard by, from whence
after an hour he returns with the end of
the Patriarchs Bridle upon his right Arm,
whose Reins are four yards long, sup∣ported
by three Noblemen behind his
Majesty: The Patriarch sits side long up∣on
an Horse covered all over with fine
white Linnen, in his hand he holds a rich

I fear I shall die for hunger. But how∣ever,
in this hungry posture he was fain
to continue with great affliction and re∣luctancy,

Of their Carnaval and excessive
drinking: The sad consequence there∣of.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Burials are strange, as soon as
the breath is out of the body (as
we commonly express it) they carry the
Corps into the Church, where it abides
not long before it be buried in the
Church-yard. The Wife of the deceased
is obliged to howl most pitifully, and
hire others to do the like, but little rea∣son
have they to do it, considering their
severe usage; but custom, not love, may
possibly incite them to do it: <HI>Ut fleren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

observation on the whole Sex. The
Russians count that the greatest Funeral
where are most Women-mourners; such
were the <HI>Praeficae</HI> among the old Romans.
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
These therefore in a doleful tone cry
out (as the wild Irish do, <HI>O hone) Tim∣minny
Dooshinca;</HI> Alas my Dear, why
hast thou left me, was I not obedient to
to thee in all things? was I not careful
of thy House? did I not bring thee fine
Children? hadst thou not all things in
abundance? Or thus; Why wouldst
thou die? hadst thou not a fair Wife,
pretty Children, much Goods, good
Clothes, and Brandy-wine enough? As
soon as any one is dead they open the
windows, and set a Bason of holy Wa∣ter
for the Soul to bath in, and a Bowl
of Wheat at the head of the Corps,
that he may eat, having a long Journey
to go.</P>
<P>After this they put on his feet a pair
of black-shoes, and some Copeakes, or
pieces of money in his Mouth, with a
Certificate in his hand (from the Metro∣polite
of the place) to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> of
his life and conversation.</P>
<P>If any one dies without Confession
and Extreme-Unction, he is denied
Christian burial. Such as are kill'd or
frozen to death, are brought into the
<HI>Zemzky precaus,</HI> an Office for that, and
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
many other trials, and there they are ex∣posed
to view three or four dayes; if
any own them they are carried away,
if not they are sent to the <HI>Bosky</HI> or <HI>Bogh∣zi
Dome (i.e.</HI> God's House) which is a
great pit in the fields arched over, where∣in
they put an hundred or two hundred,
and let them rest till <HI>Midsummer,</HI> and
then the Popes go and bury them, and
cover them with earth.</P>
<P>Thirty daies after burial, they read
the Psalter over daily upon the Grave,
having a little Booth made up of Mats
to shelter them from the weather, but
what their meaning is in this, I cannot
understand.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Carnaval</HI> before <HI>Quadragessima,</HI>
or <HI>Lent,</HI> they give themselves over to all
manner of debauchery and luxury, and
in the last week they drink as if they
were never to drink more. Some drink
<HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> four times distill'd, until it
fire in their mouths, and kindle a flame
not unlike that of <HI>Bocca di inferno,</HI> which
issues out at their throat; if they have
not milk given them to drink, they pre∣sently
die. Much wiser in my judgment
are our English Bully-rocks, who love
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
to keep fire at its due distance, no less
then a Pipes length off their Noses.
These drinking bouts are commonly at∣tended
with quarrels, fightings and mur∣thers.
This custom the Jovial Poet
look'd upon no less then barbarous: <HI>In∣ter
potandum pugnare Thracum est, barba∣rum
tollite morem, verecundum{que} rixis
prohibete</HI> Bacchum. Some of these go∣ing
home drunk, if not attended with a
sober companion, fall asleep upon the
Snow (a sad cold bed) and there they
are frozen to death. If any of their
acquaintance chance to pass by, though
they see them like to perish, yet will
they not assist them, to avoid the trouble
of examination if they should die in
their hands: For those of the <HI>Zemsky
precaus</HI> will extort something out of eve∣ry
bodies purse, who comes to their Of∣fice.
'Tis a sad sight to see a dozen
people brought upright in a Sledge fro∣zen
to death, some have their arms ea∣ten
off by Dogs, others their faces, and
others have nothing left but Bones:
Two or three hundred have been brought
after this manner in the time of Lent.
By this you may see the sad consequence

<P>THeir Imagery is very pitiful paint∣ing,

they were not proud. When a Picture
is worn out, they bring it into the God-market,
where laying it down, they
chuse out a new one, and deposite mo∣ney
for the exchange (for they must not
be said to buy it) if the money be not
enough the God-maker shoves it back,
and then the <HI>Devoto</HI> adds more, till the

themselves, cry, <HI>Prosty Bradt,</HI> God be

strive above all things to save their Ima∣ges:
but if they escape not the Confla∣gration
they must not be said to be
burnt, but gone up. If a Church be
burn'd, they say it is ascended, they must
not say burn'd. <HI>These are their pretty ridi∣culous

staid the fire by that means, held his

him no good, he threw him into the

This year a Woman, who had
formerly adorn'd her <HI>Micola</HI> with some
Pearl, being necessitated, came to the

Church, and pray'd <HI>Micola</HI> to lend her
some of his Jewels, for she was at pre∣sent
in great want, the dumb brute not
speaking any thing to the contrary, she
(thinking silence gave consent) made bold
to take a Ruby or two off him: but the
Pope spying her, complains to the Ju∣stice,
who commanded both her hands
to be cut off, which was done three
months since.</P>
<P>In their private houses they do ordina∣rily
give and take, as they thrive in their
business; for if they have any great
losses, they will come home and rob
<HI>Micola</HI> to his shirt. Herosie among the
<HI>Russes</HI> is punished with fire. The Here∣tick
goes up to the top of a little house,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Tragical Relation of a Monkey. His
several tricks. How he threw down the
Images, and scar'd the Priest. His ap∣prehension,
and final condemnation. The
Authors Reflections.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw that I am discoursing of the
Russian Church, it will not be amiss
to relate a sad Tragical story, which
was acted in the time of our English
Resident, who it seems had a Monkey
famous amongst the Muscovites to this
day, for he would take money in his
mouth, and go into the Market, and
shew it to the Costard-mongers, who
in kindness would give him Nuts and
Apples; many such apish pranks he was
wont to play. But we come now to the
Catastrophe of his mirth. Being not
content to act a merry part in <HI>Foro,</HI> he
begins <HI>lu dere cum Sacris,</HI> and goes into a
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
Church hard by the English House,
where he crept in and tumbled down
their Gods. The Priest amaz'd to see
what was done, crosses himself a thou∣sand
times, and sets their God-ships in
their places again, exorcises the foul
Fiend, taking his Horse-tail dipt in holy
water, he dashes the doors and win∣dows,
that this Devil might not re-enter.
But for all this, one morning early Pug
came in at a window, and began with
St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and the rest of the Gods
and Goddesses in order, as they stood in
his way; down he throws <HI>Dagon</HI> and
the wares of <HI>Rimnon</HI> as zealously as if
he had been bred up in new <HI>England,</HI> and
ever and anon he grinn'd in the Popes
face, who standing arm'd with a Cross
and holy Water, therewith besprinkled
Pug, who (hating it as bad as the Devil,)
fled home.</P>
<P>Presently the Pope goes to the Patri∣arch,
and complains most bitterly a∣gainst
a <HI>Nincheen</HI> (or Stranger) living
in the English house, for throwing down
many of their Gods, breaking their
Lamps, pulling off their Jewels and
Chains of Pearl wherewith they were
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
adorn'd and lastly for prophaning the
holy place. Hereupon an order was
sent to search and examine the Embassa∣dors
house; all his Retinue was brought
forth. No, it was none of them, but
a little <HI>Ninicheen;</HI> so the young chil∣dren
were brought out, and by chance
the Monkey came jumping in with the
Children: O that is the <HI>Nincheen,</HI> quoth
the Pope, apprehend him, which was
done accordingly, and the Patriarch
finding out the folly, was asham'd, and
sent away the Priest with disgrace for a
Fool. But however, poor Pug (to pa∣cifie
the angry Gods) was deliver'd over
to the secular power, who chastisd him
so severely that he dyed upon it. Now
Chronology would be enquir'd into,
Whether <HI>Ben Johnsons</HI> Zeal of the Land,
or Countrey man of <HI>Banbury,</HI> who in a
Fanatick fury destroy'd the Ginger-bread-Idols
in <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, for
which he suffer'd persecution, and was
put into the stocks: Or this American
Reformer, who threw down the Russi∣an
Ginger-bread (for if you saw their
Images, you would take them for no
better than guilded Ginger-bread) I
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
say whether of these two is the Pro∣to-Monkey,
Martyr, and ought to have
precedency in their Canonization. But
I leave the determination of this nicety
to those who are profess'd Criticks, and
well vers'd in Controversie.</P>
<P>This special piece of the Russian
Church-History was forgotten to be in∣serted

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEfore you go out of this holy
Church (which I never desir'd to

of the Russian Musick: Ever since

<HI>Orpheus</HI> his time these Beasts have de∣lighted

</LG></Q>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> call the <HI>Russes</HI> Bears, or
<HI>Ursae septentrionales.</HI> By the way suffer
me to tell you a story of <HI>Eliah</HI> when he
was Embassador in <HI>Holland.</HI> This man
being treated with all Dainties both of
Flesh and Fish, said, he had rather have
a piece of <HI>Paultusse,</HI> or Turbet half salt∣ed,
which begets such an <HI>Hogo</HI> as best
suits a Russian pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at, but strong enough
to destroy a whole Guild of squeasy
stomach'd Cockneys. The Hollanders
willing to gratifie his ears with the best
Musick in all <HI>Holland,</HI> both Vocal and
Instrumental, asked him how he liked
it, to which he replied; very well, for
the Beggars use to beg in such Tunes in
<HI>Russia.</HI> What tunes they were I know
not. But all the Beggars here beg sing∣ing,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
as well Prisoners as Cripples, and a
strenuous voice looseth nothing by its
harsh notes. For the Russians love no∣thing
soft or smooth but their womens
fat sides. But I come to their Musick,
least I should tyre you with tuning it.
You must know they have Musick-Schools,
where Children are brought
up with great diligence, and in much
severity. Their notes are very strange,
borrowed, I suppose, of the Greeks, or
Sclavonians. Their Gamut has small
variety; instead of <HI>Fa, sol, la,</HI> they sing
<HI>Ga, ga, ge,</HI> warbling them out, as if they
were indeed either gag'd or throttled.</P>
<P>Their Cadences and Closes are so un∣expected,
that they seem frighted into
them, as our Fidlers are when a Con∣stable
comes in the midst of a Lesson.
Sometimes they will run hard upon a
scent, as though they meant to imitate
the Italian Recitative Musick. Finally,
when they have brought up these chil∣dren
to a perfection, what with Bases,
Tenors, Contratenors, and Trebles, you
shall hear as good a Consort, as ever
was sung a at <HI>Cats Vespers.</HI> They have
but little Instrumental Musick, it being
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
prohibited by the Patriarch in oppositi∣on
to the Romish Church. And it has al∣so
been thought State policy to forbid
all Musick or Jollity among the Com∣mons,
to prevent Effeminacy. They
have Bagpipes, and small Fiddles with
bellies like Lutes, wherewith they play
four or five notes.</P>
<P>As for their Warlike Musick they
have Kettle Drums, whose dull sound
does well agree with the Russian Satur∣nine
Genius. And the Trumpet, which
I think has not been long used, for they
can hardly blow it so well as a Sow-Gelder
does his Horn. In their hunting
they use brass Bugles, which altogether
make an hideous noise. In short, if you
would please a Russian with Musick,
Get a consort of <HI>Billings-gate</HI> Nightin∣gales,
which joyn'd with a flight of
screech Owls, a nest of Jackdaws, a pack
of hungry Wolves, seven Hogs in a win∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y

Corrivals, and let them sing <HI>Lacrymae,</HI>
and that will ravish a pair of Russian
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uggs, better than all the Musick in <HI>Ita∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI>

neither: For example, at this time <HI>Bo∣ris
Juanoidg Morosof,</HI> the second man in
the Empire propounds one of his Re∣tainers
in marriage to a rich Widow of
Dutch extract, but Rebaptiz'd into the
Russian Faith. The Widow falls down at
<HI>Boris Juanoidges</HI> Ladies feet, Sister to the
press, and intreats her to interceed for
her to her Lord, for she was minded to
remain a Widow during life. No re∣quest
would be granted: What, said
she, wilt thou <HI>Bischest, i.e.</HI> dishonour
my Lord so far as to refuse that man, to
whom my Lord has given his word that
he shall marry thee. A great disgrace
it is to offer the least affront or denial to
that which may tend to the breach of my
great Lords word.</P>
<P>They do most by Brokers,, and the
Young-man seldom sees his Wife till
they come into the brides Chamber; if
she be ugly she pays for it soundly, it
may be the first time he sees her. To
prevent future mistakes, the Bride∣grooms

see the Bride stark naked, and ob∣serve
whether she has any defect in her

she must be cured of it before she mar∣ries.</P>
<P>One at <HI>Vologda</HI> intending to marry his
Daughter, employ'd a Broker to a young
man, who would not have her till he
had seen her: Hereupon it was order∣ed
she should pass through such a Street
at Noon-day, the fellow was placed in
an house, and was to see her through an
hole; now the wench (you must know)
had but one eye, and he was set on the
right side, where she appear'd hand∣some,
and passed for currant; so the
Indentures were drawn, and Sureties gi∣ven
that he should not beat, but how
they were kept, I have not yet learned.
A Woman that kills her Husband is bu∣ri'd
alive, put into the ground up to the

soon done in Winter. <HI>Here the crime and
the punishment are well accommodated: For

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A merry story of a great Fish, which the

being discover'd, they are asham'd, and
make an Entertainment. Another story
of a Fish, but more Tragical. What en∣sued
upon it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEfore I leave the Church-men, I
must tell you a merry story of the
Monastery of <HI>Rostone,</HI> which stands up∣on
a Lake, and not far from this Friar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there is a Nunnery also, for commonly
they are near together. In this Lake,
about twenty years since, a Fish was
seen of such a magnitude, that they sup∣posed
it could not be a Fish, but rather
some <HI>spectrum, Leviathan,</HI> or Water-Devil.
It would often appear half a∣bove
water, which made an Eagle stoop
at it with such violence, that piercing
his Talons into the Flesh, he could not
pull them out again; but <HI>Leviathan</HI>
plunging to the bottom with his enemy,
carried him into an unknown element,
<PB N="39" REF="34"/>
and so overcame him, but could not be
so rid of him, for his Talons still stuck
fast, which made him repair to the
shore, where being seen by the Friars
with feathers on his back, he confirm'd
their Fears; and therefore to prevent
further mischief, they fell a ringing the
Bells, went on procession with all the in∣struments
and weapons of defence,
wherewith these Friars-militant wont
to resist the foul Fiend, but all this did
little avail to profligate the supposed
enemy of Mankind. At last one Mr. <HI>Ro∣ger
Eaton</HI> a Merchant coming by, hears
this sad Relation, and being curious to
see with the rest, who stood upon the
shore, he undertook to encounter the
Monster; an attempt no doubt as peri∣lous
by Water, as that of St. <HI>Georges</HI> was
by Land; the worst was, he could not
find a <HI>Russ</HI> so bold &amp; hardy as to row the
Boat for him, till he had made one cou∣ragious
by drinking. In short, he shots
the Beast with a screw'd Gun, who be∣ing
taken up, proved to be nothing else
but an over-grown Pike▪ a yard and an
half long, and as big as a Man. The
Fraternity asham'd of their Processions
<PB N="40" REF="35"/>
made against a silly Fish, did neverthe∣less
to gratifie their Champion, make
themselves and him drunk, and so the
Play ended. But a worse Tragedy was
acted, when they took another Pike not
so large at this, intending to entertain
one Mr. <HI>White</HI> an English Merchant; for
the Cook cutting it open, found a new-born
Infant in its belly, which was sus∣pected
to be thrown in by one of the
Nuns: This accident spoil'd their in∣tended

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Chircasses</HI> hold the same Greek
Faith with the Russians, but are
not altogether so superstitious; for
they permit Strangers to come into their
Churches. One of their <HI>Protopopes</HI> had
appointed one in the Parish to come to
him about mid-night unto private con∣fession,
<PB N="41" REF="35"/>
but as the story goes, she fail'd
of her promise. Next morning in the
Church she stands aloof by her self, and
after the <HI>Protopope</HI> had incens'd the rest
of the good women, he comes to her,
and instead of a Benediction, he de∣mands
why she kept not her promise;
to which she replied. <HI>Chichaco Boyallis,</HI>
I was afraid of <HI>Chichaco</HI> (a curst Cur
which he had) then he incens'd her again,
and said he was tyed up, Then (quoth
she) <HI>Moya Dooshinco,</HI> My Dear, Ah
what a sinner was I, that I knew not so
much before. Excuse this Drollery,
which only serves as a Farce to fill up the
Scene of a jejune story; for I shall hard∣ly
make the Description of this barba∣rous
place worth the pains and trouble
of Reading.</P>
<P>Now we are in <HI>Chichass</HI> Land, it will
not be amiss to tell you what people
they are, <HI>viz.</HI> A kind of Tartars, a rude
swarthy look'd people; their Women
are very unhandsome, gross, and grosly
given to drinking; so that at an Enter∣tainment
they will be drunk before meat
comes on the Table, and with eating
recover themselves, and after Dinner
<PB N="43" REF="36"/>
be drunk again, and then recover them∣selves
by Dancing, which they love so
much, that they count him a mean man
who does not keep a Fidler in his house.
Their Government is perfectly Anarchi∣cal,
for upon an Insurrection they de∣stroy'd
all their Nobility and Gentry,
and are now govern'd by Collonels of
their own chusing, with whom the
meanest is Hail Fellow well met. Soul∣diers
they call in their Language, <HI>Cos∣sacks,</HI>
which makes some mistake, and
think them to be a Nation. These people
are much devoted to Witch-craft, and
count it an extraordinary piece of learn∣ing
practised by the chief Women in the
Countrey. They are more hospitable
to Strangers than the Russians, and their
Countrey or Land is better and war∣mer.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Russian Government is perfectly
Monarchical, it has offices call'd
<HI>Precauses;</HI> the dispensation of their Ju∣stice
is commonly Arbitrary, for they
have very few written Laws, they go
much upon Presidents (but money is
their best President, which overthrows
all the former) They waste abundance
of Paper in writing down things at
large (as our Common-law Clerks do)
all in Rolls of a great length, and al∣though
they have a Table before them,
they cannot write but upon their knees,
after the old fashion that St. <HI>Jerom</HI> is
pictur'd. Their Clerks they call <HI>Podi∣acks,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="37"/>
and he that is Lord Deputy, <HI>Di∣ack.</HI>
They borrow most of their Cha∣racters
from the Greeks, (in num∣ber.

<P>All things are transacted by way of
Petition, which is roll'd up like a Wa∣ser,
and the Petitioner holds it up be∣fore
the <HI>Boyar,</HI> who if in a good humour
puts forth his hand to receive it,
and either reads it presently, or gives
it to his <HI>Diac,</HI> who commonly must
be brib'd for a Remembrancer. His
Imperial Majesty is a goodly per∣son,
two months older than King
<HI>Charles</HI> the Second, of a sanguine com∣plexion,
light brown hair, his beard
uncut, he is tall and fat, of a majesti∣cal
Deportment, severe in his anger,
bountiful, charitable chastly uxorious,
very kind to his Sisters and Children, of
a strong memory, strict in his Devoti∣ons,
and a favourer of his Religion;
and had he not such a cloud of Syco∣phants

who blind his good intentions, no doubt
he might be numbred amongst the best

</ARGUMENT>
<P>REturn we now to our Great Empe∣rour,
who is an absolute Morarch,
but has a Council both general and par∣ticular
to advise with. His Dominions
<PB N="47" REF="39"/>
are inlarged by his Forefathers; for at
first they were but Dukes of <HI>Volodimir,</HI>
and increasing in strength possess'd them∣selves
of <HI>Mosco,</HI> or (as they write) <HI>Mos∣cua.</HI>
The Emperours Pallace to this
day is called, <HI>Crimlena Gorod,</HI> or <HI>Crim-Castle.
Juan Vasilowidg</HI> (that is called
the Tyrant) was a stout Prince, but had
many strange humours. One day he came
to his <HI>Diac,</HI> and gave him a Petition, de∣siring
him that he would be pleased to
make ready 20000 Men and Arms by
such a time, and he should be very thank∣ful
to him, and pray for his health, and
so he subscrib'd himself, <HI>Thy humble Ser∣vant,</HI>
Jocky <HI>of</HI> Moscua. In this Expe∣dition
he conquer'd <HI>Casan,</HI> a thousand
<HI>Versts</HI> down the River <HI>Volga,</HI> and <HI>Astra∣can
(quasi civitas)</HI> the Imperial City two
thousand <HI>Versts</HI> hence; Took <HI>Syberia</HI>
three thousand <HI>Versts</HI> distant, and one of
the best flowers of the Empire. The
people loved him very well, for he treat∣ed
them kindly, but chastised his <HI>Boy∣ars.</HI>
He had a Staff with a very sharp
Spike in the end thereof, which in dis∣course
he would strike through his <HI>Boy∣ars</HI>
feet, and if they could bear it with∣out
<PB N="48" REF="40"/>
out any flinching, he would highly prefer
them.</P>
<P>He once sent to <HI>Vologda</HI> for a <HI>Colpack</HI>
of Fleas, and because they could not
bring him full measure, he fined them.</P>
<P>On a Festival he play'd certain mad
pranks, which caused some Strangers,
<HI>viz.</HI> Dutch and English Women to
laugh; he taking notice hereof, sent for
them all to his Pallace, and had them
strip't stark naked before him in a great
Room, then he commanded four or five
bushels of pease to be thrown down be∣fore
them, and made them pick them all
up, when they had done he gave them
some wine, and bad them take heed how
they laugh'd before an Emperour again.
He sent for a Nobleman of <HI>Casan,</HI> who
was call'd <HI>Plesheare,</HI> which is Bald, and
the <HI>Vayod</HI> mistaking (as the Russians say)
thought he had sent for an hundred and
fifty Baldpates: <HI>Polteraste</HI> sounding like
his name signifi'd so many. He therefore
got together about eighty or ninety, and
sent them up speedily, with an excuse
that he could find no more in his Pro∣vince,
and desir'd pardon. The Emperor
seeing so many Baldpates, wonder'd what
<PB N="49" REF="40"/>
it meant, and cross'd himself; at last
one of the chief delivering the Letter, he
ask'd his <HI>Diack</HI> what he wrote to the
<HI>Vayod,</HI> who shew'd him the copy, by
which he found out the mistake, and so
making the Bald-pates drunk for three
dayes, he sent them whom again. Ano∣ther
<HI>Vayod</HI> had taken a Goose for a
bribe stuff'd full of Ducats, and being
complained of, he took no notice of
him, till one day passing through the
<HI>Poshiarr</HI> (an open place like <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
where execution was us'd to be done) he
commanded the Hangman to cut off his
Arms and his Legs; and at every blow
the Hangman asked him whether Goose
was good meat.</P>
<P>He courted Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> very
much to marry her, and was a great
friend to the English. Once upon a sus∣picion
of Treason, he fortified <HI>Vologda,</HI>
and drew all his Treasure thither, and
as some think upon extremity, intend∣ed
his flight for <HI>England.</HI> This Empe∣rour
erected the best buildings in all
<HI>Moscua.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Juan Vasilowidg</HI> nail'd a French
Embassadors hat to his head. Sir <HI>Je∣rom
<PB N="50" REF="41"/>
Boze</HI> a while after came as Embas∣sador,
and put on his Hat, and cock't it
before him, at which he sternly de∣manded
how he durst do so, having
heard how he chastis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the French Em∣bassador.
Sir <HI>Jerom</HI> answer'd, he re∣presented
a cowardly King of <HI>France,</HI>
but I am the Embassador of the invin∣cible
Queen of <HI>England,</HI> who does not
vail her Bonnet, nor bare her Head to
any Prince living; and if any of her
Ministers shall receive any affront a∣broad,
she is able to revenge her own
quarrel. Look you there (quoth <HI>Juan
Vasilowidg</HI> to his <HI>Boyars)</HI> there is a brave
Fellow indeed, that dares do and say
thus much for his Mistris; which
Whoreson of you all dare do so much
for me your Master? This made them
envy Sir <HI>Jerom,</HI> and perswade the Em∣ror
to give him a wilde Horse to tame;
which he did, managing him with such
rigour, that the Horse grew so tyr'd and
tam'd, that he fell down dead under
him; this being done, he asked his Ma∣jesty
if he had any more wild Horses to
tame. The Emperour afterwards much
honour'd him, for he loved such a da∣ring
<PB N="51" REF="41"/>
fellow as he was, and a madd blade
to boot.</P>
<P>When <HI>Juan</HI> went his progress, many
of the Commons as well as Gentry
presented him with fine Presents: A
good honest Bask-shoemaker, who made
shoes of Bask for a <HI>Copeak</HI> a pair, con∣sults
with his wife what to present his
Majesty; says she, a pair of fine <HI>Lop∣kyes,</HI>
or shoes of Bask; that is no rarity
(quoth he); but we have an huge great
Turnip in the Garden, we'l give him
that, and a pair of <HI>Lopkyes</HI> also. Thus
they did; and the Emperour took the
present so kindly, that he made all his
Nobility buy <HI>Lopkyes</HI> of the fellow at
five shillings a pair, and he wore one
pair himself. Thus put the man in stock,
whereby he began to drive a Trade, and
in time grew so considerable, that he
left a great estate behnd him. His Fa∣mily
are now Gentlemen, and call'd
<HI>Lopotsky's.</HI> There is a tree standing
near his <HI>quondam</HI> house, upon which it
is a custom to throw all their old <HI>Lop∣kyes</HI>
as they pass by, in memory of this
Gallant.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="42"/>
A Gentleman seeing him so well paid
for his Turnep, made account by the rule
of proportion to get a greater Reward
for a brave Horse; but the Emperour
suspecting his design, gave him nothing
but the great Turnep, for which he was
both abash'd and laugh'd at.</P>
<P><HI>Juan</HI> in a disguise sought a lodging in a
Village nigh the City, none would let
him in but a poor man whose wife was
then in Travel, and deliver'd whilst he
was there; away he went before day,
and told the man he would bring him
some Godfathers next day; according∣ly
he and many of his Nobility came
and gave the poor Fellow a good largess,
and burn'd all the houses in the Village
but his, exhorting them to charity, and
telling them, because they refused to
admit Strangers into their houses, they
should be forced to seek their Fortunes,
and try how good it was to lie out of
doors in the Winter.</P>
<P>Sometimes he would associate with
Thieves in a disguise, and once he ad∣vis'd
them to rob the Exchequer; for
(says he) I know the way to it; but one
of the Fellows up with his Fist, and
<PB N="53" REF="42"/>
struck him a hearty good blow on the
Face, saying, Thou Rogue, wilt thou
offer to rob his Majesty who is so good
to us; let us go rob such a rich <HI>Boyar</HI>
who has cozen'd his Majesty of vast
sums. At this <HI>Juan</HI> was well pleased,
and at parting changed caps with the
fellow, and bid him meet him next
morning in the <HI>Duaretz</HI> (a place in the
Court where the Emperour used often
to pass by) and there (said he) I will
bring thee to a good cup of <HI>Aqua vitae</HI>
and <HI>Mead.</HI> The Thief came accord∣ingly,
and being discover'd by his Ma∣jesty,
was call'd up, admonish'd to steal
no more, preferr'd in the Court, and
serv'd for a discoverer of Thieves.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THis present Emperour comes of
<HI>Juans</HI> Race by the Mothers side: He
had an elder Brother, an hopeful Prince,
although he would take Pigeons, and
pick out their eyes, saying to one, thou
art a Traytor, and to another, cutting
off his head, Thou art <HI>Ivan</HI> such an one,
a Rebellious Traytor to my Father and
me. But he dyed young.</P>
<P>All the Emperours Sons are call'd
<HI>Czarowidges,</HI> that is to say <HI>Czar's</HI> Sons,
<HI>As for the word</HI> Czar, <HI>it has so near re∣lation
to</HI> Cesar <HI>(as</HI> Thevet <HI>observes in</HI> Ba∣sils
<HI>life) that it may well be granted to sig∣nifie

have in to be an higher Title than King,
and yet they call <HI>David Czar,</HI> and our
<PB N="55" REF="43"/>
Kings, <HI>Kirrols,</HI> probably from <HI>Carolus
Quintus, whose history they have among
them.</HI></P>
<P>The present Emperours name is <HI>A∣lexie
Michalowidg Romanove.</HI> viz. <HI>Alex∣is</HI>
the Son of <HI>Michael</HI> the <HI>Roman.</HI> He puts
in many Titles into his broad Seal as
the Spanyards do. And thus he stiles
himself.</P>
<Q>BY the Grace of God We the

and <HI>Groozinian</HI> Dukes:
And of many other Dominions
and Countreys, East, VVest and
North Heir thereof, From Fa∣ther
and Grandfather Lord and
Monarch.</Q>
<P>The Emperour in his Arms gives the
spread Eagle, as descending from the
Roman Emperours, but he carries a
distinction, for he bears between the
double head of the Eagle a mitred
Crown, and in the Eagles breast St.
<HI>George</HI> on Horse-back; which some say
was added upon Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> be∣stowing
the Order of the Garter to <HI>Juan
Vasilowidg.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Czarowidg</HI> (as I said elsewhere) is
not seen of the people till he is about
fifteen years old, nor of many Noble∣men;
but then he is exposed to publick
view, carried upon mens shoulders, and
set on high in the Market-place, which
<PB N="57" REF="44"/>
is to prevent Impostors, wherewith
this Land has often been deceived.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> marries not out of his own
Dominions, but takes a wife where he
pleases, though seldom out of the Nobi∣lity.
When she dyes, all the interest
of her Kindred and Relations dies with
her. <HI>Eliah</HI> the present Emperours Fa∣ther
in law was of so mean account, that
within this twenty years he drew wine
to some English men, and his daughter
gather'd <HI>Mushrooms,</HI> and sold them in the
Market. The other which he should
have had was a Captains Daughter.
The Imperial Pallace is built of Stone
and Brick, except some lodgings where∣in
his Majesty sleeps and eats all the win∣ter:
For they esteem wooden Rooms
far wholsomer than Stone; and they
have some reason to think so, because
their stone Rooms being arched thick
reverberate a dampness when the Stove
is hot. The Emperour lodges three sto∣ry
high. His drink is <HI>Brague</HI> made of
Oates. His bread is made of Rye, which
the Russians esteem a stronger nourish∣ment
than Wheat. The <HI>Czar</HI> lyes in no
sheets, but in his Shirts and Drawers,
<PB N="58" REF="45"/>
under a rich sable Coverlid, and one
Sheet under him. His Recreations are
hunting and hawking. He keeps above
three hundred Falconers, and has the
best Ger-Falcons in the World, which
are brought from <HI>Syberia;</HI> he flyes at
Ducks or other Fowl. He hunts the
Bear, Wolf, Tyger, Fox, or rather baits
them at his pleasure.</P>
<P>Whensoever he goes forth, the East
Gate of the inner Wall of the City is
shut till he returns. He seldom visits
any Subject, yet the last year he did,
but went not in the common way, for the
side of a wall was pull'd down. At the
birth of the <HI>Czaroidg</HI> the Commons for
joy bring him great Presents, which he
returns back again, but if he likes any
of them, he gives the full worth. On
the <HI>Saturday</HI> after Good <HI>Friday,</HI> he goes
into some of the Prisons, examines the
Prisoners crimes, and delivers many of
them. An English man put in for coyn∣ing,
was lately releas'd. They put very
few to death here, only whip them,
which is worse than the paines of death.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS the Emperours Territories are
great, so is his Revenue; For (First)
he is master in a manner of every man's
Estate, the Son does alwaies petition
for his Fathers Land. They all hold in
<HI>Capite.</HI> He is heir to all who dye inte∣state,
criminally or without heirs.</P>
<P>Secondly, his Customs are very con∣siderable.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>Cabacks</HI> (or places where
in are sold <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> and strong Beer)
are his Royalty, and farms out fome for
10000 Rubbles <HI>per annum,</HI> and some
again for 20000 Rubbles.</P>
<P>Fourthly, His Bath-Stoves, which
<PB N="60" REF="46"/>
are very frequent here, are a great <HI>En∣trado,</HI>
for their Religion obliges to free-Baths,
both Men, Women and Chil∣dren.
When they are hissing hot, they
cast cold water upon them. Some come
out into the Snow, and tumble in it stark
naked, and then go into the Stove again.</P>
<P>Fifthly, He is the chief Merchant in
all the Empire.</P>
<P>Sixthly, His Sable Trade in <HI>Syberia</HI>
yields a vast treasure, brought in by the
exil'd Slaves sent thither in disgrace.</P>
<P>Seventhly, The <HI>Caviare</HI> made at <HI>A∣stracan,</HI>
as also the <HI>Ithyocolla</HI> and <HI>Agarick,</HI>
all which he monopolizes.</P>
<P>All his Provision is brought in by
those who hold Lands in <HI>Villenage.</HI> This
year a Fire hapning in his Store-house
burnt and broyl'd sixty thousand Flitches
of Bacon. By which you may see the
Russians are no Tartars, abhorring
Swines flesh. Yet they retain some of
the Mosaical Law about Hares, Squir∣rels
and Coneys: Yea, they hold it <HI>Po∣gano</HI>

a flock of blind Owls are they, more in

<PB N="61" REF="47"/>
sight of their understanding is dazled
with the bright beams of truth. When
the Greeks or Persians come the Empe∣rour
ingrosses all their Commodities at
a price. To <HI>Archangel,</HI> he sends great
quantities of Hides, Wax, Potash,
Hemp and Flax, and so furnishes him∣self
with their Commodities, which
serve him to give away amongst his Sub∣jects;
for most of his Graces are be∣stow'd
in Silks, Sables, Cloth, Velvet,
or cloth of Gold. To his Houshold
Servants he gives allowances of Meal,
Honey, Fish, Nut-oyl, Oates, Beer and
Mead. His Imperial Pallace is encom∣pass'd
with an high brick Wall, larger
by half than the circumference of the
Tower, herein are twenty four Churches
and Chappels, most of them have guild∣ed
<HI>Cupola's,</HI> and great Crosses, which
make a splendid show altogether. The
high Tower, called <HI>Ivan Velicky,</HI> was
built by <HI>Juan Vasilowich.</HI> It stands by
its self, and serves for a Belfry, wherein
are thirty or forty Bells. The <HI>Cupola</HI> of
this Tower is guilt, the body of Brick
and Stone, and the height as great as
St. <HI>Marks</HI> Tower at <HI>Venice.</HI> Some of
<PB N="62" REF="48"/>
the chief <HI>Boyars</HI> have Pallaces of Stone
within the walls of the Court, as <HI>Knez
Jacob a Chircasse</HI> Prince, <HI>Boris Juannoidg,
Morosof▪</HI> the Emperours Guardian in his
minority: <HI>Knez Alexis</HI> Master of the
Fur-Office, <HI>Mehectowidg Trebotsky</HI> a Ge∣neral,
<HI>Eliah Danelowidg, Meluslafsky</HI> the
Emperours Father in law, <HI>Knez Juan
Vasiloidg Adofsky.</HI></P>
<P>There are also five Monasteries, and
two or three Nunneries together, with
most of the <HI>Precauses,</HI> or Courts of Ju∣stice,
the <HI>Apotheca,</HI> or Ammunition Gal∣lery.
The <HI>Czar</HI> has Officers of State as
other Princes have, but not of so great
value. His Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber
come not into his Chamber,
but wait in the next Room to it, and at
the Table also, some two or three Rooms
off. The <HI>Czar</HI> is temperate in his Diet,
drinks very little Wine, sometimes he
drinks at meales a little Cinnamon wa∣ter,
or oyl of Cinnamon in his smal beer.
For Cinnamon here (you must know)
is the <HI>Aroma Imperiale,;</HI> the scents of
Musk and Ambergreece are not
much esteem'd, but Rose water is much
used at Court, and so is holy Water in
the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="48"/>
At the entertainment of his Nobili∣ty,
the Emperour sits in his Chair, and
delivers out of his hand a <HI>Chark</HI> of treble
or quadruble Spirits, which are able to
take away his breath who is not ac∣custom'd
to them. His Majesty will
laugh to see his Subjects handsomly
fuddled, and sometimes he will put <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>
into their Liquor. Old General
<HI>Alexander Leshly</HI> a <HI>Scot</HI> aged ninety nine
years; now alive at <HI>Smolensko,</HI> had dis∣course
with the Emperour about the
storming of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> who being ear∣nest
to hear would not dismiss <HI>Leshly,</HI>
then afflicted with an uncessant <HI>Diarrhaea▪</HI>
his modesty kept him a little too long,
but at last being necessitated, he got away
abruptly: The Emperour wondring at
it, demanded the reason of his suddain
departure; but understanding how the
case went with the old man, who had lost
nothing but the bolt of his back-gate,
he fell into such a laughter as sufficiently
declar'd he was not displeased with the
Generals abruptness.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Cannot at present give you an ac∣count
of their Judiciary proceedings,
which are very confused, and yet they
have a method, and every Province its
<HI>Precause</HI> or Office, wherein is a <HI>Bayor,</HI>
or Lord, and a Chancellor call'd a <HI>Diac,</HI>
who hath many Clerks under him: He
represents the <HI>Boyar,</HI> who is the Repre∣sentative
of his Imperial Majesty. If
there be a Suit in Law, and no bribes on
either side, most commonly the Plain∣tiff
gets the better for they presume he
has most right.</P>
<P>Murther is here to be bought off with
money; If a Man kill his Slave or his
Wife in correcting them, there is no
<PB N="72" REF="53"/>
law against them. Or if a man is mur∣ther'd,
and no body prosecured his mur∣therer,
the law takes no notice of his
death.</P>
<P>The accused cannot be condemn'd
although a thousand witnesses come in a∣gainst
him, except he confesses the Fact;
and to this end they want not torments
to extort Confessions; For first, they
put them upon the Strappado, if this
does not, they secondly whip them, and
herein their Hangmen are very exqui∣site:
For 'tis said at six or seven lashes
they are able to kill a man. Sometimes
the consederate will see the enemy to
execute such a piece of his office, to pre∣vent
farther mischief.</P>
<P>They can strike to an hairs breadth,
and with a sharp kind of Iron pierce
through the very Ribs; they will slice
down a mans back like a Chine of Pork,
and when that's done, they will salt the
raw place, bind his hands and legs, and
putting a Cowlstaff through them, hold
him over the Fire, and Carbonadoe him.
If he persists (for may be the party has
nothing to confess) they let him loose,
and the Hangman sets his shoulders, and
<PB N="73" REF="53"/>
lets him rest twenty days, till he be al∣most
well, and then repeats the former
Torments, and perhaps pull out a Rib
or tow with a pair of hot Pincers; If
all this will not do (for some will out∣stand
all these Tortures) they will then
shave the crown of his Head, and drop
cold water upon the bare place, which
some that have felt, acknowledge to be
the quintessence of all Torments; for
every drop strikes like a dart to the
very heart. All this is done where the
Hangman is not brib'd, for he will then
cut deep. I have seen some whose backs
have been scarifi'd like the bark of a
Tree, which afterwards were healed,
but they could never wear out the scars
and marks thereof.</P>
<P>The punishment of Coyners is to
melt some of the coyn, and pour it
down their throat. <HI>Neque enim lex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣stior

also who said he saw a Sea beyond <HI>Sybe∣ria</HI>
wherein were Ships and Men in
strange habits, like the <HI>Chinesses</HI> by their
description, rich in cloth of Gold and
Jewels, no Beards but on their upper
lip. From hence this latter brought
<HI>Chay</HI> and <HI>Bour Dian.</HI> The <HI>Chay</HI> is that
which we call <HI>Teah</HI> or <HI>Tey,</HI> and <HI>Bour∣dian.</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="55"/>
is <HI>Anisum Indicum Stellatum,</HI>
the Merchants say they use it (as we do
in <HI>England)</HI> with Sugar, and esteem it
a rare Remedy in diseases of the Lungs,
<HI>flatus Hypochondriaci,</HI> and distempers of
the Stomach; 'tis brought over in pa∣pers
about one pound weight, written
on with <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters. They who
travel into these parts are six years in
their Journey, staying for winter way
in some places, and summer in others.
The Metropolis of <HI>Syberia</HI> is <HI>Zambul,</HI>
the Residence of the chief <HI>Vayod.</HI> They
trade in Furs, and chiefly in Sables,
which, as some say, are found in no o∣ther
part of the world beside. They
feed on a Berry or Nut, which here grows
plentifully upon trees, what it is I can∣not
learn, but am promised some of
them, with further information. They
hunt six or seven weeks together, and
are drawn by Dogs, whom they feed
with Fish, wherewith their Lakes and
Rivers abound,: they put forty or fifty
Dogs in a Sledge, and are cloth'd with
treble Furs; they lie out all night in
the coldest season, and make fires, with
which they dress their Fish. The Dogs
<PB N="77" REF="55"/>
are expert in finding out the <HI>Sable,</HI> and
the Men as dextrous in shooting them in
the nose with a bolt, which makes
them become a prey to the hounds. Ex∣cept
they hit the <HI>Sable</HI> in the nose they
lose him, for he is an hardy Beast, and
will run away with an Arrow in his Bo∣dy;
besides, it spoils the Fur.</P>
<P>'Tis so excessive cold here, that wa∣ter
thrown up into the Air will descend
congeal'd into Ice. The most Northern
parts afford no Bread, but Fish in abun∣dance,
which they eat dryed instead of
bread, and yet they live to a great age.
They feed their Cows with Fish during
the frost, which makes the milk taste
fishy. The River <HI>Ob</HI> is a vast River,
whose end is as yet unknown: there is
great store of Fish call'd <HI>Bebuga,</HI> much
like a Whale, but better meat, out of
whose spawn and the Sturgeons toge∣ther,
they make <HI>Caviare</HI> at <HI>Astracan,</HI>
which they lay in great heaps of salt,
and after a little fermentation press it,
and barrel it up. We have some here
unpress'd; 'tis a great dainty, but will
not keep.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="56"/>
The North of <HI>Syberia</HI> is call'd <HI>Samo∣geda,</HI>
or <HI>Tsamoeida,</HI> which signifies Ca∣nibals,
or Men-eaters, for they eat those
whom they conquer in battel. Their
food is most Fish, their riches Deer, of
which they have great herds, and so
tame, that at whistle they will appear at
hand, and suffer themselves to be har∣nessed,
and put to the sledges by pairs,
which they will draw swiftly as wind
eighty miles a day. When they hunt
for new Deer, they consult the Priest,
who, after many ceremonies and conju∣rations,
tells them in what quarter they
must go, and most commonly they find
his predictions true. There is no di∣stinction
in the clothes of Male or Fe∣male,
but both are made of Deer
skins, with the hair side outward, which
by experience they find the warmest.
You can hardly distinguish the men and
women by their visage, neither wear
Beards, and both have faces like Ba∣boons.</P>
<P>Their Manners, Language and Religi∣on
are brutish, for they worship the Sun
and Moon, and good reason have they to
adore the one, and make good use of
<PB N="79" REF="56"/>
his light, which they enjoy so little in
the winter. They are excessively jea∣lous
of their Wives, which puts me in
mind of the strength of fancy and cu∣stom:
One being ask't if he thought
not an English Woman (then present,
young and handsom) as pretty and fair
as his Lady ugly; answer'd, no surely,
thy Wives complexion is pale, like the
belly of a Fish, our Womens colours
are natural and genuine. Their Daugh∣ters
are esteem'd great Riches, and must
not be seen by young men, till contract∣ed
in Marriage, which they are at six or
seven years old, that they may be sure
to have them Virgins: they buy them of
their Parents for so many head of Deer,
and take them home to their houses, and
lock them up <HI>al Italiano.</HI> The men like∣wise
serve their wives so, when they go an
hunting, and 'tis as ordinary as strings
to a purse. For they have a Proverb,
<HI>He that leaves his purse open invites a
Thief to it;</HI> such as have seen their En∣gines,
say they come not short of the
Italian ones.</P>
<P>Their houses are only round tents
made of Deer-skins and Matts, with a
<PB N="80" REF="57"/>
fire in the midst, and a hole at the top
for the smoke, about which they lye
round, and find themselves warm e∣nough.
In the Summer they remove
near the Rivers to fish, which they dry,
and preserve against Winter, they kill
their fishes with arrows, and most com∣monly
eat them raw: they eat young
Puppies, and count them a rare dish.
They are not thought worthy of a Go∣vernour
by his Imperial Majesty, nor
so considerable as to be taxed, only vo∣luntarily
they pay a few Deer. None
understand their barbarous language
but themselves, nor yet their Laws
which they execute secretly. When
they sell a Deer to Strangers, they are
sure to indent to have the garbage, which
they eat after a slight squeezing out of
the excrements. He is best qualifi'd a∣mongst
them who knows most in Magick,
wherein they are excellent, especially
before Strangers, but amongst the <HI>Russes</HI>
they dare not play any feats, least they

reason why they are such dwarffs, is, be∣cause
<PB N="82" REF="58"/>
they are so often burnt down by
Strangers or Travellers, who making
fires in the Autumn catelesty depart, and
the grass being long and dry takes fire,
which sometimes has pursued them to
death, two or three hundred Furlongs
have been burnt at a time. These trees
yield a sine red Cherry, but very tart:
Such as have been transplanted have
proved very good. I have spoken with
those who have seen here variety of Tu∣lips,
Damask and red Roses. Asparagus
exceeding large, Onions, Marjoram,

Coneys, When Colonel <HI>Crafords</HI> Re∣giment

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or certain they say, that their Burroughs
are very finely contriv'd, and that they

that if any of them dye in the Burrough,

short, and of little warmth; this beast
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s said to be very civil in carrying
Squirrels and Ermines over Rivers, and
this is the reason why he is called <HI>Perri∣voshick,

worth. They celebrate the Festivals
of their own Saints with greater honour
than the Apostles. For they say of St. <HI>Ni∣cholas,</HI>
he is <HI>Nasha Bradt,</HI> one of our Bre∣thern,
and has a greater kindness for us
his Countrey-men, than St. <HI>Peter</HI> or
St. <HI>Paul</HI> who never knew us. When
they have extorted a vast Estate out of
the bowels of poor people, and grind∣ing
the faces of Strangers, they think to
expiate all their wicked actions at last by
building a Church, and endowing it with
abundance of Images adorn'd with Je∣wels,
and furnishing it with a Ring of
Bells; this they account a meritorious
work, and indeed it is so when the glory
of God is chiefly aim'd at, and not self∣interest
and vain applause sought there∣by.
Greater Rogues there are not in
the whole world, yet there is many good
people also. Such as have improv'd
their parts by conversing with Stran∣gers,
are more civiliz'd; yea those who
have seen the Polish way of living, which
though I cannot much admire, yet sure∣ly
'tis not so barbarous as the Russian;
for they have a way to improve their
wits by Learning, which they are de∣bar'd

civil and hospitable to Strangers,
till they have seen all their pomp, and
have been drunk twice or thrice, and

<P>Their Laws are the most barbarous
of any people living, for homicide is
satisfi'd by a pecuniary mulct, a Crown
(as I remember) for killing a Peasant,

<P><PB N="94" REF="64"/>
Their King may be stiled <HI>Rex Baccha∣torum,</HI>
for in their <HI>Comitia,</HI> when a vote
has passed all but one peremptory Cox∣comb,
he will rise up in the spirit of
contradiction, and laying his hand up∣on
his Cimitar saucily protest against
it, though not able to give a reason for
what he says, and perhaps the business
is demurr'd for that time; next day be∣ing
half drunk, he will be the first in
passing the very same vote. Their King
is little better than a painted Rudder,
which seems to steer, but does not.
<HI>Henry</HI> the Third, afterwards King of
<HI>France</HI> was (as I take it) King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and so weary of his Kingship, that he
would willingly have chang'd it for a
pair of Shoes of good running Leather.
On a certain day he made an entertain∣ment
for many of the Nobility, whom
he made drunk, having for his own wine
nothing but fair water colour'd red:
One of these drunken Lords he laid in
his own Royal Bed, the Curtains were
drawn, and Waiters stood by the bed
side, who knew nothing of the design.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY Lady <HI>Lues Venerea</HI> is as well
known in <HI>Poland</HI> as in the place
where she was born; not a <HI>mushy panny</HI>
(Lord) nor a <HI>pannya</HI> (Lady) but are inti∣mately
acquainted with her, and so is
the Court and the Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Russes</HI> in the conquests of <HI>Vilna,</HI>
and many other Towns and Pro∣vinces
on the Borders of <HI>Poland,</HI> have
taken her Ladiship prisoner, whom they
are like to keep longer than their Towns.
For till this War she was not known
<PB N="97" REF="65"/>
here this thousand years: But when she
gets into such a cold Countrey as this,
she earths like a Badger so deep, that
there's no driving of her out without a
Pickaxe or Firebrand; <HI>juxta illud, les
Veroles de Rouen et la boue du Paris ne ja∣mais
sortont la pais sans oster la piece.</HI> The
Pox of <HI>Rouen,</HI> and the Dirt of <HI>Paris</HI> ne∣ver
go away without taking a piece out.</P>
<P>But what is worse, the <HI>Poles</HI> have the
<HI>Plica</HI> as familiar among them, as the
French have the Itch; and so infectious
too, that few in a house escape it when
'tis once crept in amongst them. Cer∣tainly
there cannot be a greater plague
in the world, for besides its many
dreadful symptoms, the nasty elfish lock
stinks like an old Ulcer, and yet they
wear it as a badge of Nobility. Some
you shall have with hair full of
brayds or knots, as I saw a Monks, which
look'd like <HI>Medusa's,</HI> who for this
monstrosity was accounted a man of
more than ordinary sanctity. The like
esteem they have of Horses, who are

good courage and service, If an envi∣ous
<PB N="98" REF="66"/>
person cuts off never so little of the
<HI>Plica,</HI> the Horse either dyes, runs mad,
or becomes blind and lame.</P>
<P>They say the first use of Hair-powder
came from the <HI>Poles,</HI> who were fain to
perfume the <HI>Plica</HI> to abate its odious
stench. 'Tis hard escaping this disease
if you pass through the Countrey, where
Arsenical Mines poyson the water, for it
comes on a suddain; <HI>Unico aquae Arseni∣cae

<P>The Poles are more honourable in
keeeping their Articles and Covenants
than the Russians, who seldom keep faith
with an enemy, if the breach thereof be
but advantageous. Yet in private con∣cerns
the <HI>Russ</HI> fears an oath, because 'tis
seldom administred, which makes it the
more to be reverenced.</P>
<P>Their Languages differ not much, just
as English and Scotch, the Polish is
said to be the more copious and com∣plemental,
but to my ears, which judge
by outward sounds, it seems the more
harsh in pronunciation, and worse than
a medly of Welsh, Irish and Cornish.</P>
<P>They spit in your face when they talk.

salutations are in lofty terms, they bow
not so much as the Russians. The Tar∣tars
salute with their fore-finger upon
their mouth, and a little nod, and em∣brace
their Superiors about the knees.
The Chircasses salutes are blunt and
rude, as, how do thy Children and thy
Servants, thy Cows and thy Sheep, thy
Horses and Goats and Swine, thy Cocks,
Hens and Turkeys, are they all in good
health? This they punctually repeat
every morning they meet. They are of
the Greek saith, but not so superstitious
as the Russians, who think their Chur∣ches
defiled if a Stranger sets his foot in∣to
them, and therefore wash them after
that pollution, and the Stranger must ei∣ther
turn <HI>Russ,</HI> or satisfie his folly with
the loss of his life; in which they imi∣tate

this would become the history
of the <HI>Czars</HI> life, which I wish I had
opportunity and ability to write: For
certainly since Kings raign'd upon earth,
there never was a man heard of more
prodigiously Tyrannical, and yet a more
fortunate Prince than he.</P>
<P>The Father of this present <HI>Czar</HI> was
was <HI>Michael,</HI> a Prince of incomparable
clemency and magnificence, a lover of
peace and amity with all Christian
King's, kind to Strangers, and very Re∣ligious.
<HI>Grave Wolmer,</HI> the late King
of <HI>Denmarks</HI> natural Son should have
married his Daughter, but the Clergy
objected he was an Heretick, hereupon
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proffer'd his Chaplains should main∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain
the truth of his Faith, which the

days after going well to bed, about
mid-night he was taken with a vomit∣ing,
and dyed in the morning, and (after
the Russian fashion) was carried into the
Church the next night. So the dis∣pute
ended. His <HI>Czaritsa</HI> did not long
survive him, and <HI>Grave Wolmer</HI> was fain
to leave his Mistris, and shift for him∣self
as well as he could.</P>
<P>This <HI>Czar</HI> often charged his Son to
follow his Governours counsel in all
affairs, who was <HI>Boris Juanoidg Moro∣sove</HI>
by name, of whose Father the
<HI>Russes</HI> relate this story, That he being a
favourite of the great Tyrant, presumed
(being a Widdower) to beg one of his
handsome Concubines for a Wife, which
was granted him, but whilst they were
at their amorous enjoyments shut up in
the Bathstove, he secretly convey'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
wild Bear, which fell upon them, and
devour'd them both. He had two Sons
<HI>Boris</HI> and <HI>Chleab,</HI> which the Emperou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
educated. <HI>Boris</HI> being a kind of Lord
Protector, diminished the number o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the old Dukes to Governments afar off;
<HI>Ripnine</HI> to <HI>Belgorod,</HI> and <HI>Corakin</HI> to <HI>Ca∣zan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> being to take a Wife, all the
choice beauties in the Countrey are
brought before him, one he fancies, and
gives her a Handkerchief and Ring, she
appears again in a Royal dress; but <HI>Bo∣ris</HI>
ordered the Crown to be tyed so
hard about her head, that she fell into
a swoon, this was presently construed
an Epileptick fit,; her Father being ex∣amined
with torments, was, alas poor
old Gentleman, sent into <HI>Syberia,</HI> and died
by the way with grief, and left his Fa∣mily
in disgrace. The maid is still alive,
but never known to have had any more
fits. She has been offer'd many Noble∣men,
but refuses all, and keeps the Hand∣kerchief
and Ring. The <HI>Czar</HI> allows
her a pension to expiate the injury done
to her Father and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Juanoidg</HI> proposed <HI>Mary</HI> the
Daughter of <HI>Eliah Daneloidg</HI> of obscure
Gentility, rais'd by the death of his
Uncle <HI>Grammatine</HI> the Chancellor of the
Embassadors Office, to whom he fill'd
wine in his minority, The present
<PB N="104" REF="69"/>
<HI>Ctzaritsa</HI> has often gone into the woods
to gather Mushrooms. She was a tole∣rable
beauty. adorn'd with the precious
jewels of modesty, industry and religi∣on.
She was married prrvately for fear
of Witch-craft, which is here com∣mon
at Nuptials. <HI>Boris</HI> petitioned for
the younger Sister <HI>Anna,</HI> and obtain'd
her, and from thence concluded his in∣terest
well rivetted. But the Lady was
not so well pleas'd with him being an
old Widdower, and she a succulent
black young Lass; so instead of chil∣dren
jealousies were got, which produ∣ced
a leathern lace about a finger thick,
a complement that often passes between
the Russian Lords and their Ladies, when
their Amours are extravagant, or the
Brandy wine too strong in their heads.
One <HI>William Barnsly</HI> an English man
(born at <HI>Barnsly</HI> Hall in <HI>Worcestershire)</HI>
was sent to <HI>Syberia</HI> by this <HI>Boris</HI>'s insti∣gation
for being suspected too familiar
in his house. He has been their above
twenty years, and at last he turn'd <HI>Russ,</HI>
and was richly married.</P>
<P>This height of <HI>Boris</HI> draws envious
eyes from the ancient Nobility, whom
<PB N="105" REF="69"/>
he daily makes to decline, and brings in
creatures of his own. The people mur∣mure
at their new Taxes, accuse <HI>Boris,</HI>
and peremptorily demand him of the
<HI>Czar,</HI> who finding himself surpriz'd, de∣sir'd
the life of <HI>Boris</HI> might be spared,
and kissing the Cross, swore he should
never come to the Court again. The
old Nobility are countenanced for a
time: In the mean while the commons
are complemented underhand to petiti∣on
for <HI>Boris</HI> his Restauration, which was
easily granted. <HI>Boris</HI> hereupon gratifies
the people, and becomes their Favou∣rite,
and a patron also to Strangers. He
died six years since, in a good old age,
successful he was in his Counsels, belo∣ved
of his Prince, lamented by the
People, but not of the Nobility, who
cannot yet accomplish their designs.
For <HI>Eliah Daneloidg</HI> is made <HI>Generalissi∣mo.</HI>

<HI>Cizaritsa</HI> has often gone into the woods
to gather Mushrooms. She was a tole∣rable
beauty. adorn'd with the precious
jewels of modesty, industry and religi∣on.
She was married prrvately for fear
of Witch-craft, which is here com∣mon
at Nuptials. <HI>Boris</HI> petitioned for
the younger Sister <HI>Anna,</HI> and obtain'd
her, and from thence concluded his in∣terest
well rivetted. But the Lady was
not so well pleas'd with him being an
old Widdower, and she a succulent
black young Lass; so instead of chil∣dren
jealousies were got, which produ∣ced
a leathern lace about a finger thick,
a complement that often passes between
the Russian Lords and their Ladies, when
their Amours are extravagant, or the
Brandy wine too strong in their heads.
One <HI>William Barnsly</HI> an English man
(born at <HI>Barnsly</HI> Hall in <HI>Worcestershire)</HI>
was sent to <HI>Syberia</HI> by this <HI>Boris</HI>'s insti∣gation
for being suspected too familiar
in his house. He has been their above
twenty years, and at last he turn'd <HI>Russ,</HI>
and was richly married.</P>
<P>This height of <HI>Boris</HI> draws envious
eyes from the ancient Nobility, whom
<PB N="150" REF="71"/>
he daily makes to decline, and brings in
creatures of his own. The people mur∣mure
at their new Taxes, accuse <HI>Boris,</HI>
and peremptorily demand him of the
<HI>Czar,</HI> who finding himself surpriz'd, de∣sir'd
the life of <HI>Boris</HI> might be spared,
and kissing the Cross, swore he should
never come to the Court again. The
old Nobility are countenanced for a
time: In the mean while the commons
are complemented underhand to petiti∣on
for <HI>Boris</HI> his Restauration, which was
easily granted. <HI>Boris</HI> hereupon gratifies
the people, and becomes their Favou∣rite,
and a patron also to Strangers. He
died six years since, in a good old age,
successful he was in his Counsels, belo∣ved
of his Prince, lamented by the
People, but not of the Nobility, who
cannot yet accomplish their designs.
For <HI>Eliah Daneloidg</HI> is made <HI>Generalissi∣mo.</HI>
He is a goodly person, has limbs
and muscles like <HI>Hercules,</HI> a bold man,
of great parts, and such a vast memory,
that he knew all the Commission Officers
of an Army eighty thousand strong,
where they quarter'd, and what their
qualifications were; the <HI>Czar</HI> rather
<PB N="106" REF="72"/>
fear'd him than lov'd him; but the
<HI>Czaritsa</HI> alwaies kept up his Interest. He
is made Lord Treasurer, and six or seven
Offices more are conferr'd upon him,
all which he manages with great vigour,
but not without Bribery. Which the
<HI>Czar</HI> did the more connive at, because
he knew full well that this Silver stream
at long running would fall into the Oce∣an.
Notwithstanding all these expecta∣tions,
at last perceiving <HI>Eliah</HI> too kind
to some of his handsome Tartar and
Polish slaves, he urged him (being an
old Widdower) either to marry or re∣frain
the Court. For the Russians high∣ly
extoll marriage, partly to people
their Territories, and partly to prevent
Sodomy and Buggery, to which they
are naturally inclined, nor is it punish∣ed
there with Death. A lusty Fellow
about eight years since being at this
beastly sport with a Cow, cry'd to one
that saw him <HI>Ne Misheay,</HI> do not inter∣rupt
me; and now he is known by no
other name over all <HI>Muscovy,</HI> then <HI>Ne
Misheai.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eliah</HI> at present having had an Apo∣plectick
fit, is disabled in body and

mind, and knows no body without be∣ing
told. His miss had been the greater,
had not that great States-man <HI>Nashockin,</HI>
succeeded and suppli'd his place in many
Offices.</P>
<P>It was this <HI>Nashockin</HI> who concluded
the peace with <HI>Poland</HI> upon honourable
terms, and finished the League with
<HI>Swedland.</HI> He is now made Chancel∣lor
of the Embassadors Office, Treasu∣rer,
Lord of <HI>Russia</HI> minor, and has seve∣ral
other Offices. He contriv'd the
Silk-trade through <HI>Russia,</HI> and 'tis
thought all the Indian Trade will be
drawn that way. He is now about re∣forming
the Russian Laws, and new mo∣delling
all the <HI>Czardom.</HI> There shall be
no delatory Suites; all Governours with
their Assistants shall have power of life
and death; for before all Criminals
were brought to <HI>Mosco,</HI> with no less
trouble than charge to the <HI>Czar.</HI> This
same counsel <HI>Jethro</HI> gave to <HI>Moses.</HI> This
<HI>Nashockin</HI> is one who will not be corrup∣ted,
he is a very sober abstemious man,
indefatigable in business, an admirer of
Monarchs: Speaking about the French
and Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> siding with the Hollander a∣gainst
<PB N="108" REF="73"/>
<HI>England,</HI> he brake forth into these
words. I wonder that these two King's
should have no more prudence or rea∣son,
than to support or countenance such
Boors against the Monarch of <HI>England,</HI>
who should rather joyn together with
the rest of the Princes in <HI>Europe</HI> to de∣stroy
all Republicks, which are no bet∣ter
than the Nurseries of Heresie and
Rebellion. I have heard him say, that
'tis the <HI>Czars</HI> interest to keep a good
correspondence with the King of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
above any other Christian Prince.
He is the only Patron the English have.
Being sollicited to admit of English
goods, he produced the <HI>London</HI> Bill of
Mortality, wherein very few dyed of the
Plague; notwithstanding (said he) how
do we know but the Goods may be
brought out of some of the infected
houses, and one spark of fire will kindle
a whole sack of Charcoale. 'Tis a
strange custom to publish your infirmi∣ties.
Beggars indeed expose their ul∣cers
to to raise commiseration, and get
relief. But they who proclaim the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st,
give a caveat against all commerce of
them, as men set up lights to keep ships
<PB N="109" REF="73"/>
off their coasts. Another thing seems
strange unto us, that Royal Letters are
often sent privately to us in in behalf of
private men to demand Justice, as if
our <HI>Czar</HI> had not made sufficient provi∣sion
for Strangers as well as Natives.
We seldom have any such applications
from any other Prince but that of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
where we hear they are purchas'd
at a cheap rate: What they cost in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
we know not, but what have we to
do with the customs of other Nations.
Their clothes will not fit us, nor our
cloths them: thus he ended his discourse
abruptly, and if he had spoken more
then he had mind should be repeated.
<HI>But by this you may judge</HI> (tanquam ex
unque leonem) <HI>that he is a great Politician,
and a very grave and wise Minister of
State, not inferiour peradventure to any one
in</HI> Europe.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Czars</HI> description. His answer to a
Stranger. How he appears in publick.
He never visits any Subject. His Court
without noise. He seldom dines publick∣ly.
At <HI>Easter</HI> his Subjects kiss his
hand. How he pays his <HI>Strelsies.</HI> What
he has done to employ the poor. The
<HI>Czaritza</HI> governs the Women. From
whence the Emperour's chief Revenues

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I shall now give you a further descrip∣tion
of the Czar. He is a goodly
person, about six foot high, well set, in∣clin'd
to fat, of a clear complexion,
lightish hair, somewhat a low forehead,
of a stern countenance, severe in his
chastisements, but very careful of his
Subjects love. Being urged by a Stran∣ger
to make it death for any man to de∣sert
his Colours; he answer'd, it was
a hard case to do that, for God has not
given courage to all men alike. He ne∣ver
<PB N="111" REF="74"/>
appears to the people but in magni∣ficence,
and on Festivals with wonderful
splendor of Jewels and Attendant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ He
never went to any Subjects house but his
Governours when he was thought past
all recovery. His Centinels and Guards
placed round about his Court, stand
like silent and immoveable Statues. No
noise is heard in his Pallace, no more
than if uninhabited. None but his Dome∣sticks
are suffer'd to approach the in∣ward
Court, except the Lords that are
in Office. He never dines publickly but
on Festivals, and then his Nobility dine
in his presence. At <HI>Easter</HI> all the No∣bility
and Gentry, and Courtiers kiss
the Emperours hand, and receive Eggs.
Every meal he sends dishes of meat to
his Favourites from his own Table. His
stores of Corn, and dry'd flesh are very
considerable, with these he pays his
<HI>Strelsies</HI> or <HI>Janzaries,</HI> giving them some
cloth, but very little money; for they
have all Trades, and great Priviledges.</P>
<P>The Emperour with his <HI>Pottash,</HI> Wax
and Honey, he buys Velvet, Sattin, Da∣mask,
cloth of Gold and Broad-cloth,
with which he gratifies his Officers for
their service.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="75"/>
He hath now seven <HI>Versts</HI> off <HI>Mosco,</HI> built
Work-houses for Hemp and Flax, in
that good order, beauty and ca∣pacity,
that they will employ all the
poor in his Kingdom with work. He
hath allotted many miles of wast Land
for that design.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czaritza</HI> is to govern the wo∣mens
side for her use and profit. Thus
the <HI>Czar</HI> improves the Manufactures of
his Countrey, feeds all the Labourers
as cheap as we do our Dogs. And lays
up the money that comes out of the
Cabacks, Bath stoves, Tart, Pitch, Hemp,
Flax, Honey, Wax, Caviare, Sturgeon,
Bellusa, and other salted and dry'd fish
from <HI>Astracan, Cazan,</HI> the Lake <HI>Belsira,</HI>
and many other Lakes and Rivers with
which the Countrey abounds, especi∣ally
<HI>Syberia</HI> in the latter.</P>

<P>The <HI>Czar</HI> goes every year to a house of plea∣sure
call'd <HI>Obrasawsky.</HI> Of the curious
tents erected there. How cautious the
Emperour is of letting the vulgar sort
behold his pastimes. This commended
for several reasons. None are to petition

a poor Russian Captain for so doing. The
Emperours resentment for his death.

'Tis death to reveal any thing spoken

</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVery year towards the latter end of
<HI>May</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> goes three miles out
of <HI>Mosco,</HI> to an house of pleasure call'd
<PB N="114" REF="76"/>
<HI>Obrasausky:</HI> In English Transfiguration,
being dedicated to the Transfiguration
in the Mount. And according to that,
<HI>Master 'tis good for us to be here, let us
make three Tabernacles;</HI> So the Empe∣rour
has most magnificent Tents, his
own is made of cloth of Gold, lined
with Sables. His <HI>Czaritsa's</HI> with cloth
of Silver, lined with Ermines. The
Princes according to their degree. His
and <HI>Czarritsa's,</HI> with those of his eleven
children and five Sisters, stand in a circle
with the Church-Tent in the middle,
the most glorious shew in its kind that
ever I saw. There are Rails and Guards
set Musquet shot from them, beyond
which no man may pass without order:
Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Czar</HI> will have none of the vul∣gar
people to be eye-witnesses of his pa∣stimes.
Indeed the too near approaches
of the common Rabble make discovery
of Princes infirmities, not to say vani∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,
Majesty is jealous of Gazers.
<HI>This made</HI> Montezume <HI>King of</HI> Mexico
<HI>keep his Subjects at such a distance that
they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urst not behold him, familiarity
breeds contempt, when Princes expose them∣selves
too much unto publick view, they
<PB N="115" REF="76"/>
grow cheap, and are little regarded. There∣fore
in a Theatre, the Stage is rail'd in, that
the Spectators may not crowd upon the
Scenes, which shew best at a distance. And
so it fares with Princes, the more they are
reserv'd the more they are observ'd, the
more implor'd the more ador'd; otherwise
they run a great hazard of being contemn'd,
and reckon'd no better than their Subjects,
seeing an equal mortality and frailty of flesh
attends all men.</HI> When the <HI>Czar</HI>
goes into the Countrey or fields to
take his pleasure he gives strict charge
that none should interrupt him with
Petitions. A Captain of white <HI>Russia,</HI>
and native of that Countrey being three
years without pay, and finding no re∣stress
from <HI>Peter Solticove</HI> Lord of that
Province, came and press'd too near the
<HI>Czars</HI> coach; the <HI>Czar</HI> perceiving no
petition in his hand, suspected he might
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e an Assassinate, and with his staff
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>once <HI>Cxar Juans)</HI> not unlike a dart, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending
to push the fellow away, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruck him to the heart, and he died.
The Nobility rid up to the coach, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arching what arms the man had, found
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>othing but a wooden spoon, and a peti∣tion
<PB N="116" REF="77"/>
for three years Arrears, Where∣upon
the <HI>Czar</HI> smote his Breast, saying,
I have kill'd an innocent person, but
<HI>Peter Solticove</HI> is guilty of his blood,
whom God forgive; and immediatly
sending for him, after a severe check,
he turn'd him out of his place, banish∣ed
him from the Court, and appointed
<HI>Nashockin</HI> that great Minister of State to
take his Office, and examine and find
out the misdemeanours thereof. This
hapned in <HI>June</HI> last, and this action was
but whispred, and that too with much
peril of a mans tongue.</P>
<P>In the night season the <HI>Czar</HI> will go
about and visit his Chancellors Desks,
and see what Decrees are pass'd, and
what Petitions are unanswer'd. He has
his spyes in every corner, and nothing is
done or said at any Feast, publick Meet∣ing,
Burial or Wedding but he knows
it. He has spyes also attending his Ar∣mies
to watch their motions, and give a
true account of their actions: These
spyes are Gentlemen of small fortunes
who depend on the Emperours favour
and are sent into Armies, and along with
Embassadors, and are present on all pub∣lick
occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="77"/>
'Tis death for any one to reveal what
is spoken in the <HI>Czars</HI> Pallace. I being
curious to see the fine buildings for the
Flax and Hemp, ask't to what end they
were built, but not a Workman durst
tell me, though they know it well e∣nough;
but they replied, God and the
Emperour know best, this was all I
could get from them. The <HI>Czars</HI> chil∣dren

<P>THis Summer a Jew turn'd

Interpreter to the Persian Mer∣chants,
came in their behalf with
a loud complaint against <HI>Na∣shockin</HI>
for a business depending
in the Embassadors <HI>Precause,</HI> or
Court. To whom the <HI>Czar</HI> re∣plied,
saying, I have left <HI>Na∣shockin</HI>
to determine all affairs of
Merchants, let him do you Ju∣stice,
but if I find your Inter∣preters
complaint impertinent, I
shall place all my displeasure on
his back; and so it prov'd, where∣upon
he was graced with thirty
good ashes laid on in order like
red tape upon tawny leather, and
doubtless they will out-last the
best Garment he hath: For their
whippings are very keen, and cut
to the bone.</P>
<P>The Jews of late are strange∣ly
crept into the City and Court,
<PB N="120" REF="79"/>
by means of a Jewish Chyrurgi∣on
(pretendedly baptiz'd Luthe∣ran)
who assists <HI>Bogdan Matfeidg</HI>
(Steward of the Houshold) in his
amours, and supplies him with
Polish handmaids, he being bred
up in <HI>Poland.</HI> But his Lady (as
she had good cause) being jea∣lous
of these handsome Slaves
which her Husband kept, some
in his Gardens, and some in his
House, became a burthen unto
him; they therefore one night
last Winter brought her some
Dainties, which she eat, and was
merry after it, but in the morning
was found dead in her bed. O∣thers
say 'twas a poysoned glass
of wine they gave her, which cu∣red
her of all diseases. This cau∣sed
much grumbling among the
Commons, and since that time
<PB N="121" REF="79"/>
the <HI>Czar</HI> has urged him to marry,
and abandon that wicked life he
led with his Polish Doxies, or else
he should his place. 'Twas said
he would take one of his Mi∣stresses
for his wife. This <HI>Bog∣dan</HI>
is the <HI>Czars</HI> great Favourite,
Lord High Steward, and regu∣lates
all domestick Affairs. He
was bred up from a child with the
<HI>Czar,</HI> and is of the same age.
They call him the whispering Fa∣vourite,
because when ever he
comes to Council, he acts behind
the Door. <HI>Nashockin</HI> is no friend
to him, nor he to the English, be∣ing
better suppli'd with money
from the Dutch.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Czars</HI> Religion, he
is of the Greek Faith, and very
strict in the observation thereof.
He never misses divine Service,
<PB N="122" REF="80"/>
if he be well he goes to it, if sick
it comes to him in his chamber.
On Fast-dayes he frequents mid∣night
prayers (the old vigils of
the Church) standing four, five
or six hours together, and pro∣strating
himself to the ground
sometimes a thousand times, and
on great Festivals fifteen hun∣dred.
In the great Fast he eats
but three meals a week, <HI>viz.</HI> on
<HI>Thursday, Saturday Sunday;</HI> for
the rest he takes a piece of brown
bread and salt, a pickled Mush∣room
or Cucumber, and drinks a
cup of small beer. He eats Fish
but twice in the great Lent, and
observes it seven weeks together,
besides <HI>Maslinets</HI> (or cleansing)
week, wherein they eat milk and
eggs. Out of the Fast he ob∣serves
<HI>Mondays, Wednesdays</HI> and
<PB N="123" REF="80"/>
<HI>Fridays,</HI> and will not then eat
any thing that comes of flesh. In
fine, no Monk is more observant
of Canonical hours, then he is of
Fasts. We may reckon he fasts
almost eight months in twelve,
with the six weeks fast before
<HI>Christmas,</HI> and 2 other small fasts.</P>
<P>Those that instituted so many
Fasts advanced fish to spare flesh,
which else would be destroy'd,
because they are forc'd to house
their Cattle all the winter, some∣times
five months space. The
<HI>Czar</HI> does not disdain to assist at
the Processions bare-headed, and
on foot if it be not rainy. He is
a great Patron of the Church, yet
restrains the profuse bounty of
dying men to the Clergy. None
can found a Monastery without
his licence. He makes bold with
<PB N="124" REF="81"/>
the Church Treasary upon loan
in time of war, and pays it again
<HI>ad Graecas Calendas.</HI> For indeed
should he not do so his contribu∣tion
would fall short, seeing the
Church holds almost two third
parts of the <HI>Czardom.</HI> In his
Pallace he has an Hospital of very
old men, 120 years old, with
whom he often discourses, and
delights to hear them tell what
pass'd in his Ancestors time. Once
a year, <HI>viz</HI> upon good <HI>Friday,</HI>
he visits all the prisons in the
night, and taking personal cogni∣zance
of all the Prisoners, buys
out some that are in debt, and re∣leases
others that are criminal, as
he thinks fit: He pays great
sums for such as he is inform'd are
really necessitated. His <HI>Czaritza</HI>
buys out Women. He disposes
<PB N="125" REF="81"/>
of all Ecclesiastical preferments,
but has left the election of the
Patriarch to lot, having (as he
thinks) had ill luck in using his
Prerogative for the late Patriarch
<HI>Nicon.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this Chapter,
without doubt this present Em∣perour
of <HI>Russia</HI> is as pious, con∣scientious,
clement, merciful and
good a Prince as any in the world.
As for his People and Ministers

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Trading in Russia very low. Eng∣lish
Cloth a drug, why slighted.
The Authors Reflection. If
Persians trade there, what Eng∣lish
are like to suffer. What the
Russians are in general. Concer∣ning
the Dutch, what the English
must do to out-vye them. How
much they abuse us to the Empe∣rour.
'Twere convenient for Eng∣land
to undeceive the <HI>Czar.</HI> How
things should be represented to
<HI>Nashockin</HI> and <HI>Bogdan.</HI> The
Russians mightily pleased with
their peace with <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Trade last Summer was
very low in <HI>Mosco,</HI> by reason
of their late war, which had
<PB N="127" REF="82"/>
dreyn'd them of two Fifths, besides the
raising of their Customs, and taking
their Goods by force for copper mo∣ney,
which fell from an hundred to
one, till at last it was call'd in, to the
undoing of many men. Divers hang'd
themselves, others drunk away the resi∣due
of their States, and dyed with
drinking,</P>
<P>English Cloth is a Drug, because
dearer than the Dutch, which though
slight, and shrinks a sixth part in wet∣ting,
yet the Russians like it, because
they say none but new cloth will shrink,
but we are too blame for not fitting
them with the like. Again, we keep
our old trade of Cloth, but they bring
Silks, and all manner of pedlary ware,
which vends better than cloth, the
which grows now much out of Fashion.
<HI>Sed si populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI></P>
<P>If the Persian and Indian Silk trade
prevail in <HI>Russia,</HI> the <HI>Czar,</HI> I fear will
think it too great a boon to restore the
English Immunities, and 'twill be as
hard for them to regain their priviledges,
<PB N="128" REF="83"/>
as it was for <HI>Pharoahs</HI> people to drive
their Charriots through the Red Sea,
when their wheels fell off.</P>
<P>As I have nothing to say against the
magnificence, splendor, clemency and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtue of the <HI>Czars</HI> own person, So I
have no reason to recommend the <HI>Russes</HI>
integrity, for the generality of them
are false, Truce-breakers, subtile Foxes▪
and ravenous Wolves, much altered,
since their traffick with the Hollander,
by whom they have much improv'd
themselves in villany and deceit,</P>
<P>The Dutch, like Locusts, swarm in
<HI>Mosco,</HI> and eat bread out of the Eng∣lish-mens
mouths, they are more in
number, and richer, and spare no gifts
to attain their ends; whereas the Eng∣lish
depending on their old priviledges,
think 'tis enough to say with the Jews,
<HI>We have</HI> Abraham <HI>to our Father,</HI> we
are English men, do us right, or we
will complain: But the Russians are of
<HI>Solomons</HI> opinion, that money answers
all things.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="83"/>
If we would out-do the Dutch
Trade, it must not be driven on by such
as take up Goods upon trust and time,
as it has been these twenty years last
past. At present they come like Lo∣custs
out of the bottomless pit, and so
they do all the world over, where there
is a Sun-shine of gain. In <HI>Russia</HI> they
are better accepted than the English,

<P>The Hollanders have another advan∣tage,
by rendring the English cheap and
ridiculous by their lying pictures, and
libelling pamphlets, this makes the
Russian think us a ruined Nation. They
represent us by a Lyon painted with
three Crowns revers'd and without a
tail, and by many Mastive Dogs, whose
ears are cropt and tails cut off. With
many such scandalous prints, being
more ingenious in the use of their Pen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ils

It would not be impertinent, in my
opinion, if some intelligent person in

his Majesty of Great <HI>Britains</HI> King∣doms,
Forces and Territories to the
best advantage, and also his Colonies
in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> with all their Re∣venues,
and drawing a Map of the

Nashockin,</HI> to breed in him an opi∣nion
of his Brittish Majesties real
greatness, which the Dutch have so
much extenuated. <HI>Bogdan Matfoidg</HI>
the Chamber-Favouritie should not be
neglected neither. He fancies Rari∣ties,
and therefore should be present∣ed▪
with some. For as <HI>Nashockin</HI>
maintains reason of State, so <HI>Bog∣dan</HI>
must be the man to procure the
<HI>Czars</HI> personal affection towards his

<P>The <HI>Russes</HI> are very proud of, and
much pleased, with the honourable
peace they have made with <HI>Poland,</HI>
and now think no Nation superiour;
<PB N="131" REF="84"/>
for they are never good natur'd but
when they are either beaten or bri∣bed.

<P>Of <HI>Caviare,</HI> how and where made.
The length of the Fish <HI>Bellu∣ga.</HI>
<HI>Caviare</HI> of two sorts.
The <HI>Belluga</HI> swallows abun∣dance

<P>HAving elsewhere mentioned <HI>Ca∣viare,</HI>
I shall now give you a full
account thereof; It is made at <HI>Astra∣can,</HI>
of the Rows of Sturgeon and <HI>Bel∣luga.</HI>
The <HI>Belluga</HI> is a large Fish, a∣bout
twelve or fifteen foot long, with∣out
scales, not unlike a Sturgeon, but
more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ushious and large; his flesh is
whiter than Veal, and more delicious
than Marrow. Of these two Fishes
they take great numbers only for their
Rows sake, which they salt and press▪
and put up into Casks, some they send
<PB N="133" REF="85"/>
unpress'd, and a little corn'd with Salt
being accounted a great Dainty. <HI>Ca∣viare</HI>
is of two sorts, the first made of
the Sturgeons spawn, this is black, and
small grain'd, somewhat waxy, like
<HI>Potargo,</HI> and is call'd <HI>Eekra</HI> by the Rus∣sians,
the Turks make this. The se∣cond
sort is made of the <HI>Belluga's</HI> Row,
in whose belly is found an hundred and
fifty, and two hundred weight of spawn,
'tis a grain as large as a small pepper
corn of a darkish gray. The <HI>Belluga</HI>
lyes in the bottom of the River, and
swallows many large pebbles of an in∣credible
weight to ballast himself a∣gainst
the stream of <HI>Volga,</HI> augmented
by the snows melting; when the wa∣ters
are asswag'd he disgorges himself.
His spawn is call'd <HI>Arminska Eckra,</HI>
perhaps the Armenians were the first
makers of <HI>Caviare.</HI> This they cleanse
from its strings, salt it, and lay it up∣on
shelving boards to drain away the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yly part, and the more unctuous fat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
substance; this being done they put

<P>THis Copy I received from the hands of
a Gentleman that attended upon
the learned Dr. <HI>C.</HI> all the time of his
being with the Emperor of <HI>Russia,</HI> It was
then in the form of a Letter written with
the Doctors own hand to an eminent Do∣ctor
of Phisick here in <HI>London.</HI> After∣wards
I was advised by several Persons of
Quality to put it into the hands of some
that were learned and skilful, to distribute
it into Chapters and Sections, for the more
easie finding out anything contained there∣in,
and the better methodizing it, that it
might answer the Title designed for it. And
in regard the Author died before it came to
the Press, which prevented his looking it o∣ver,
or correcting any thing that might be oc∣casioned
through his hasty writing of it, I was
necessitated to get another worthy person to
Transcribe it, who being altogether a stran∣ger,
not only to the Doctors stile and way of
writing, but also to the stile and language
of this Country of <HI>Russia</HI> except by reading.
The Reader I humbly conceive will not won∣der
<PB REF="95"/>

in that Language have escaped his hand,
which is most in the proper names of Men
