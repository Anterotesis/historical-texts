<HEAD>THE General Description OF ASIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>SIA,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Semia,</HI> from <HI>Sem</HI> the eldest Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> to whose Lot it fell; and now by Naviga∣tors, <HI>The Levant,</HI> from the <HI>Italian</HI> Word <HI>Levante,</HI> i. e. <HI>The East,</HI> from its Easterly Situa∣tion; hath been generally accounted, by Ancient Writers, the biggest of the Three formerly Known Divisions of the WORLD, and by some estimated equal to the other Two, <HI>EUROPE</HI> and <HI>AFRI∣CA;</HI> and is moreover Ennobled with several grand Prerogatives above the rest: For here that Glorious Work of Creation first manifested it self, and terminated in that greatest of God's Handy-works, the Formation of Man: Here flourish'd the Terrestrial Paradise, or Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> which our first Parents Inhabited, Culti∣vated, and in the end, by their Disobedience, lost. And as the Creation, so also the Redem∣ption of Man-kind was here wrought, by our Blessed Saviour's Incarnation, Nativity, Preach∣ing, Miracles, and lastly, Suffering upon the Cross, and Resurrection: And here the Divine Monument of his Passion, the Holy Sepulchre, is yet preserv'd, by God's Providence, even un∣der the Guardianship of <HI>Infidels</HI> themselves. From hence, as from the Fountain of Plantation, and first Inhabited Part of the World, <HI>Colonies</HI> were sent forth into all Parts, and the whole Globe of Earth was supply'd with People. Here was the first Foundation of Cities, Institution of Laws and Government, Civilising of Manners, Ori∣ginal of Arts and Sciences, and the Communica∣tion of all Literature, both Divine and Humane, to the rest of the World. And as the two first Great and Famous Empires of the World, the <HI>Assyrian</HI> and <HI>Persian,</HI> were here Founded, and suc∣ceeded each other, continuing for the space of 1368 Years, namely, from the Year of the World 2000, to the Year 3368; so at this day the greatest Empires of the Universe are con∣tain'd in this Part thereof; as namely, the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, which though it extend it self into <HI>Europe,</HI> yet the greatest part of it is contain'd within the Verge of <HI>Asia;</HI> that of the <HI>Sophi</HI> of <HI>Persia;</HI> that of the Emperor of <HI>China;</HI> that of the <HI>Great Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary;</HI> which two last Em∣pires are now by Conquest united under one Head, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Great Chan:</HI> and that of the <HI>Great Mogol.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Seven Wonders of the World, Four were in <HI>Asia,</HI> namely, The Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> at <HI>Ephesus;</HI> The <HI>Mausoleum,</HI> or Sepulchre of <HI>Mauso∣lus,</HI> at <HI>Halicarnassus;</HI> The Walls of <HI>Babylon;</HI> and the <HI>Colossus,</HI> or Statue of the Sun, at <HI>Rhodes.</HI> Of the other three, one is in <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> The Statue of <HI>Olympick Jupiter;</HI> the other two are in <HI>Africa, viz.</HI> The <HI>Pharos</HI> or Watch-Tower, and the <HI>Aegy∣ptian Pyramids.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, Of the Fruitfulness and Pleasantness of this Part, this may serve for a great Argument, That here was chosen out by God himself that <HI>Land of Promise,</HI> for his Chosen People to dwell in, which the Scripture it self sets forth by the Commendation of <HI>A Land flowing with Milk and Honey:</HI> And <HI>Cicero</HI> represents it no less advantage∣ously, in one of his Orations to the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> in these Words; <HI>Caeterarum Provinciarum, Vectigalia, Quirites, tanta sunt ut iis, ad ipsas Pro∣vincias tutandas vix contenti esse p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssumus, Asia verotam opima est &amp; fertilis, ut &amp; ubertate agrorum &amp; varietate fructuum, &amp; magnitudine Pastionis, &amp; multitudine earum rerum quae exportent facile omnibus terries antecellat: The Tributes and Taxes, Renowned</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>Romans, <HI>gather'd from other Provinces, are scarce sufficient for the Maintenance and Defence of the Pro∣vinces themselves; but</HI> Asia <HI>is so fertile, that in the plentiful Production of its Corn-fields, the variety of its Fruits, the richness of its Pastures, and the mul∣titude of those things which for their Rarity are Ex∣ported into other Parts, it far excells all the Earth beside.</HI> And thus far <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Commendation of <HI>Asia</HI> agrees with the common Suffrage of other Writers, namely, That <HI>Asia</HI> in general, for Fruit∣fulness, Delight, and being well Peopled, is far superior to <HI>Africa;</HI> and for costly Traffick, and its abundance of high-valu'd Commodities, which hereafter shall be particulariz'd, exceeds <HI>Europe</HI> also, and may well stand in competition with the new-found World <HI>America,</HI> with all its Mines of Gold.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Denomination of <HI>Asia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COncerning the Denomination of <HI>Asia,</HI> there is some variety of conjecture, as upon all such Occasions happens; but the most generally receiv'd is (and that by the Authority of <HI>Herodotus</HI>) That it is deriv'd from the Nymph <HI>Asia,</HI> who is reckon'd by <HI>Hesiod</HI> among the Forty Daughters of <HI>Oceanus</HI> and <HI>Thetys,</HI> in this Verse:</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q>
<Q>Crisia, <HI>and</HI> Asia, <HI>and</HI> Calypso <HI>fair.</HI></Q>
<P>This Nymph, the Wife of <HI>Japetus,</HI> and Mother of <HI>Prometheus,</HI> is said to have been a Queen of great Power and Authority, extending her Domi∣nions through a great part of <HI>Asia,</HI> and thereby to have given Denomination to the whole. How∣ever, others derive it from <HI>Asius</HI> the Son of <HI>Cocy∣tus;</HI> others, from <HI>Asius</HI> the Son of <HI>Manaeus</HI> the <HI>Lydian;</HI> others, from another <HI>Asius,</HI> an ancient Philosopher, who gave the <HI>Palladium</HI> to the <HI>Tro∣jans.</HI> But the Learned <HI>Bochart,</HI> as in all his <HI>Ety∣mologies</HI> he goes a more critical way to work, so also in this, deriving it from the Word <HI>Asi,</HI> which in the <HI>Punick</HI> Tongue signifies <HI>A Middle,</HI> because it lies in the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Hinc in∣tranti dextra est Africa lae∣va Europa, inter utras{que} est Asia. <HI>Plin.</HI></NOTE> middle between <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> or perhaps because the Mountain <HI>Taurus</HI> runs through the middle of it, from East to West, as <HI>Strabo</HI> ob∣serves, thereby dividing it into two Parts, <HI>Asia Interior,</HI> and <HI>Exterior;</HI> that Part to the North being call'd <HI>Asia within Taurus;</HI> that to the South, <HI>Asia without Taurus.</HI> The Extension of this Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> from <HI>Pamphylia</HI> Eastward, through the midst of <HI>Asia,</HI> as far as the <HI>Indies,</HI> is elegantly describ'd by <HI>Dionysius Afer,</HI> in his Po∣em <HI>de Situ Orbis.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Form and Bounds of <HI>Asia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Form of <HI>Asia</HI> is observ'd by <HI>Lau∣rentius Corvinus,</HI> out of <HI>Anthoninus Ve∣ronensis,</HI> to be Conical; that is, be∣ginning from the West with a more ample Extent, and falling sharper and sharper towards the East, and ending, according to the Account of the Ancients, at a Place which being call'd <HI>Dionysii Columnae,</HI> or <HI>The Pillars of Bacchus,</HI> was once thought to be the utmost part of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The Partition between <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> was generally by old <HI>Geographers</HI> agreed to be the Ri∣ver <HI>Tanais,</HI> now <HI>Don.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (saith <HI>Scylax Cariandensis</HI> in his <HI>Periplus</HI>) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>From the River</HI> Tanais <HI>begins</HI> Asia. This he saith, as having just before finish'd his Course through <HI>Europe.</HI> To the same effect <HI>Stra∣bo; To</HI> Europe, Asia <HI>is continuous, joyn'd to it at the River</HI> Tanais. And <HI>Pliny,</HI> though he deter∣mine not the Bound between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> yet when of two distinct Portions of the Earth he makes <HI>Europe</HI> one, he continues thus; <HI>In duas par∣tes ab amne Tanai ad Gaditanum Fretum Universo Orbe diviso: The whole World being divided into two Parts, by a Line from the River</HI> Tanais <HI>to the Bay of</HI> Cadis, which is now the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth. Moreover, <HI>Strabo</HI> makes mention of a <HI>Peninsula</HI> made by the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> the Lake <HI>Maeotis,</HI> and the <HI>Euxine</HI> and <HI>Caspian</HI> Seas (with which, that <HI>Dor∣sum</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> between the Lake <HI>Maeotis</HI> and the <HI>Sarmatick</HI> Ocean, above the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> which he makes the Bound between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> seems to have some correspondence) the Entrance into which <HI>Peninsula</HI> is that <HI>Isthmus</HI> with which the Poet <HI>Dionysius</HI> parts <HI>Europe</HI> from <HI>Asia,</HI> and de∣scribes to be between the <HI>Euxine</HI> and the <HI>Caspian</HI> Seas, in these Verses.</P>

<P>The Boundaries of Modern <HI>Geographers,</HI> agree∣ing in the main with those of the Ancients, are yet somewhat more exact. <HI>Cluverius</HI> bounds <HI>Asia,</HI> Nothward, Eastward, and Southward, in like manner as <HI>Mela,</HI> only to the <HI>Indian Sea</HI> he adds the Term also of the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> Westward, with the <HI>Arabian Gulph,</HI> and the <HI>Isthmus</HI> between the <HI>Arabian Gulph</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> then the <HI>Phoenician</HI> and <HI>Aegaean Seas,</HI> the <HI>Propontis, Pontus,</HI> Lake <HI>Maeotis,</HI> Rivers <HI>Tanais</HI> and <HI>Ob.

<PB REF="6"/>the <HI>Indian</HI> and the <HI>Red Sea</HI> one, or on the same Side, he puts the <HI>Red Sea</HI> among the Western Bounds: He also calls the <HI>Eastern Ocean, The Sea of China.

<P>FRom the Mouth of <HI>Canopus</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Pontus, Timosthenes,</HI> quoted by <HI>Pliny,</HI> accounts XXVI. XXXIX Miles. Which though according to the common Inter∣pretation of these ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Numbers, it seems to be in the vulgar way of Numbring, 26039; yet in regard of the extravagant rec∣koning, and so exceeding all bounds of Truth that would follow hereupon, the Translator of <HI>Pliny</HI> reckons the first XXVI onely so many Hundreds, and brings down the Number to 2639, as indeed in probability it can be no other; and so conse∣quently in the rest. From the Mouth of <HI>Pontus,</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Maeotis, Eratosthenes</HI> reckons XV. XLV, or 1545 Miles, which together comes to XLI. LXXXIV, or 4184 Miles: But <HI>Artemi∣dorus,</HI> and <HI>Isidorus,</HI> reckon the Whole, with <HI>Aegypt,</HI> as far as <HI>Tanais,</HI> LXXXVIII, or 8800 Miles. <HI>Pliny</HI> himself, by whom all these Au∣thors are quoted, in more express Terms affirm'd the Length of <HI>Asia</HI> to be LXIII. DCC Miles; which to hold proportion with the former Num∣bers, can be but 7050. However here the <HI>Pli∣nian</HI> Interpreter forgetting himself, suffers it to run on to 630750, perhaps because of the DCC that comes after the LXIII: But this, as it would exceed the Proportion formerly observ'd, so it would bring back that Contradiction to common Sense and Reason, which he seem'd before to en∣deavor to avoid.

LXXV, or 1875 Miles, reckoning the Miles as the manner then was, by so many thousand Paces. <HI>Strabo</HI> speak∣ing of the Mountain <HI>Taurus</HI> running through the midst of <HI>Asia,</HI> from West to East, and measuring the Length of <HI>Asia</HI> by it, affirms the Length of the Mountain to be 45000 Furlongs, which comes to 5625 <HI>Italian</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Mile. <HI>Matthias Qua∣dus,</HI> though he almost follows the Words of <HI>Stra∣bo,</HI> yet he makes a longer Mount <HI>Taurus;</HI> for he accounts the Length of it 58060 Furlongs, that is, 7257 of our Miles, and four Furlongs over; and without particularizing the Breadth, affirms it to exceed the Breadth of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> put to∣gether. <HI>Mercator</HI> extends the Length of <HI>Asia</HI> from the most Western Meridian, passing through the 57<SUP>th</SUP> Degree of <HI>Longitude,</HI> to the most East∣ern, passing through the 178<SUP>th</SUP> Degree, including 121 Degrees, which reduc'd to Miles, comes to 7260. The Breadth he reckons from the <HI>Aequa∣tor</HI> to the 80<SUP>th</SUP> Degree of Northern <HI>Latitude,</HI> which amounts to 4800 Miles. <HI>Cluverius</HI> allots to <HI>Asia,</HI> between the <HI>Hellespont</HI> and <HI>Malacca,</HI> the farthest <HI>Emporium</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> the length of 1300 <HI>German</HI> Miles, which is of our Miles 5200: And for Breadth, between the Mouth of the <HI>Arabian Gulph</HI> and the Promontory <HI>Tabis,</HI> which is at the Streight of <HI>Anian,</HI> 1220 <HI>German</HI> Miles, which is of our Miles 4880. With this Measure <HI>Golniti∣us,</HI> and <HI>Lucas de Linda,</HI> exactly agree. <HI>Martiny</HI> determines the Extent of <HI>Asia</HI> from West to East, that is, from the <HI>Archipelago</HI> to the <HI>Chinese Ocean,</HI> to be 1750 Leagues; from South to North, that is, from <HI>Malacca</HI> to the Sea of <HI>Tartary,</HI> 1550 Leagues <HI>P. du Val</HI> accounts its Length from West to East, that is, from the most Western Parts of <HI>Anatolia,</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>to the Eastern Parts of <HI>China,</HI> 2500 <HI>French</HI> Leagues; the Breadth (not comprehending the Isles) 72 Degrees, that is, 1700 of the same Leagues; and all under the Septentrional Tem∣perate Zone, except some <HI>Peninsula's,</HI> which are found in the Torrid Zone.</P>
<P>Now to reduce all these several Computations to one Standard, <HI>viz.</HI> of our own Miles; there will be no great difference among the three Mo∣derns last mention'd, provided we reckon in <HI>Mar∣tiny</HI>'s Account three Leagues to a Mile, and in <HI>P. du Val</HI>'s, two <HI>French</HI> Leagues to a Mile; ac∣cording to which Reckoning, all the Modern Ac∣counts come short of the Ancient: which is the more strange, in regard late Discoverers have pe∣netrated into such remote Easterly Parts of <HI>Asia</HI> as were altogether unknown in <HI>Strabo</HI>'s, <HI>Pliny</HI>'s, or <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s time, and therefore may well be sup∣pos'd to have stretch'd it to a far greater extent. But some Mistakes may possibly arise from our not exactly enough accommodating of the Ancient Numbers or Measures to our own, as may evi∣dently appear by the vast Error that might easily have slipt from an inanimadvertency of <HI>Pliny</HI>'s Numbers.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Lakes or Seas of <HI>Asia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE greatest Lake (if it be not more properly call'd a Sea) not onely of <HI>Asia,</HI> but (generally so reputed) of the World, is the <HI>Hircanian</HI> Lake, which contains in Length 270 <HI>German</HI> Miles; in Breadth, above 100: and although there be no visible En∣trance of any other Sea into it, yet in regard its Waters are generally Salt, it is suppos'd to com∣municate with the Ocean, or some other Sea, by certain Subterraneous Passages; as undoubtedly it partakes also of several great Rivers, since in ma∣ny Places it hath Fresh Water, and abounds with some sorts of Fresh-water or River Fish. The Ancients believ'd this to be a Bay of the <HI>Scythian Ocean;</HI> but <HI>Herodotus,</HI> one of the most ancient of the <HI>Greek</HI> Writers, as also <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus,</HI> were of a different Opinion, affirming it to be a particular Sea by it self, as being no where mix'd with the Ocean: And <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> for that Reason, would rather have it call'd a Lake than a Sea; to which Opinion of his, many other Writers have given their Suffrage. However, it hath common∣ly had in times past the Appellation of <HI>The Caspian Sea,</HI> and at present is term'd <HI>Mare di Sala,</HI> or <HI>The Sea of Sala.</HI></P>
<P>The next great <HI>Asian</HI> Lake is call'd <HI>Lacus Asphaltites,</HI> or <HI>The Lake of Brimstone;</HI> the same which in Holy Writ is call'd <HI>Mare Mortuum,</HI> or <HI>The Dead Sea,</HI> in regard the Water remains fixt and immovable in so vast a Circuit. Upon this Lake stood the Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorra, Ad∣mah</HI> and <HI>Zeboim,</HI> the two first whereof are men∣tion'd in Sacred Scripture to have been destroy'd by Fire from Heaven; whereupon it hath been also known by the Name of <HI>The Lake of Gomorra.</HI> And if the fore-mention'd, much more this may be term'd a Lake, in regard it is but very small in respect of that. Over this Lake, like as over that of <HI>Avernus</HI> or <HI>Aornus</HI> in <HI>Campania,</HI> no Birds endure to fly, neither are any Fish able to live in it, by reason of the evil and noxious Savour and intollerable Stench of the Water, which is not mov'd or stirr'd by any Wind, because the Bitu∣minous Quality thereof resists, by condensing the Surface of the Water, which is so thick, that the heaviest Creatures are born upon it without swimming: But it is not Navigable by any Ships, both in regard of the thickness and immovable∣ness of the Water, and the noisomness of the Lake to all Passengers.</P>
<P>The next is the Lake or Sea in <HI>Persia</HI> call'd <HI>El-Catif.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth is the Lake of <HI>Genesareth,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and by some <HI>The Sea of Galilee.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth is the Lake <HI>Samochonites,</HI> between which, and that of <HI>Gennesareth,</HI> the River <HI>Jordan</HI> flows.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Chief Rivers of <HI>Asia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE are many Rivers of Principal note in <HI>Asia,</HI> as <HI>Euphrates, Tigris, Jor∣dan, Indus, Ganges, Ob, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Euphrates</HI> riseth in <HI>Great Armenia,</HI> and is call'd by the Inhabitants generally <HI>Phrat:</HI> But in its Progress through several Countries, it changeth its Name; for, some space from its first rising it is call'd <HI>Pyxirates;</HI> towards its entrance into the Mountain <HI>Taurus, Omira;</HI> again, coming forth from out of the said Mountain, it takes the Name of <HI>Euphrates;</HI> afterwards it toucheth upon <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> on the Left Hand, and <HI>Syria, Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Babylonia</HI> on the Right, and then divides it self into several Arms, one whereof takes its Course to <HI>Seleucia,</HI> and falls into the River <HI>Tigris;</HI> ano∣ther runs through <HI>Babylon,</HI> and loseth it self in cer∣tain Lakes of <HI>Chaldaea,</HI> but afterwards shoots it self forth again, and from thenceforth anciently it ran directly towards the Sea, where it disem∣bogu'd it self with a great Mouth; but since, ha∣ving that Course stopt by the People thereabout, for the fertilising of the Ground, it was forc'd to take its way through the <HI>Tigris</HI> again. This Ri∣ver swelling like <HI>Nilus</HI> in some places, useth to overflow the Fields of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> and make them very Fruitful.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tigris,</HI> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Tigil,</HI> in like manner hath its Source in <HI>Great Ar∣menia,</HI> in a plain Champaign place. There where this River runs with a slow gentle Stream, it is call'd <HI>Diglito;</HI> where it carried with a swift pre∣cipitous Course, <HI>Tigris,</HI> which in the <HI>Median</HI> Lan∣guage signifies <HI>A Dart.</HI> It breaks through the Lake <HI>Arethusa,</HI> and a little after, the Mountain <HI>Taurus</HI> hindring its Course, makes it self a hidden way under Ground, and rises on the other side of the Mountain; then having pierc'd through ano∣ther Lake nam'd <HI>Thospites,</HI> sinks again under Ground, and with another Subterranean Course measures six <HI>German</HI> Miles. After it hath ta∣ken in other Rivers in <HI>Assyria</HI> and <HI>Armenia,</HI> it se∣parates <HI>Assyria</HI> from <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> and at <HI>Seleucia</HI> is
<PB REF="7"/>divided into two Branches, one whereof glides to <HI>Seleucia,</HI> and the other to <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> and so makes, as it were, an Island, though of no great Magni∣tude: As soon as its Streams conjoyn into one again, it is call'd <HI>Pasitygris.</HI> At length it insinu∣ates it self into a Lake of <HI>Chaldaea,</HI> out of which having broken forth with great violence, it di∣rectly tends to the <HI>Persian Gulph,</HI> in which it ter∣minates with two Out-lets.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Jordan</HI> springs from two Fountains, though not far distant frnm each other, the one of them nam'd <HI>Jor,</HI> the other <HI>Dan,</HI> of the contex∣ture of which two Words is fram'd the Name of <HI>Jordan.</HI> This River is extremely pleasant and beautiful in its Prospect: About twelve Miles from its Source it runs into the Lake <HI>Samochonites,</HI> thence into the Lake <HI>Genesara,</HI> or <HI>Tiberias;</HI> after which it waters <HI>Judaea</HI> and <HI>Samaria;</HI> and lastly, is immerst into the Lake <HI>Asphaltites,</HI> or <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> in the way making several Turnings and Wind∣ings, as if loth to lose it self and its sweet Wa∣ters in such a noisom Sea.</P>
<P>In <HI>India</HI> are two most Noble Rivers, <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges. Indus,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Hiind,</HI> or <HI>Inder,</HI> rising from the Mountain <HI>Parapomisus,</HI> takes in nine∣teen Rivers, whereof the Chief are <HI>Hydaspis</HI> and <HI>Hypasus.</HI> The greatest Breadth of this River is fifty Furlongs, and the Depth of it fifteen Paces: With seven Mouths it empties it self into the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Ganges</HI> (now <HI>Guengam</HI>) ariseth out of the <HI>Scy∣thian</HI> Mountains, affords in many places very rich Pearl, and plenty of Gold-dust. The least Breadth of this River is said to be two <HI>German</HI> Miles, and its least Depth 100 Foot.</P>
<P>The grand Rivers of <HI>Tartaria Asiatica</HI> are <HI>Ob,</HI> and <HI>Parapomisus,</HI> now <HI>Orchardus;</HI> both which fall into the <HI>Northern Ocean: Rha,</HI> now <HI>Volga; Jax∣artes,</HI> now <HI>Chesel;</HI> and the River <HI>Edel,</HI> which disgorge into the <HI>Hircanian Sea.</HI> Of <HI>Persia, Oxus,</HI> now <HI>Abia,</HI> or <HI>Abiamu; Arbis,</HI> now <HI>Ilment;</HI> and <HI>Samydaces.</HI> Not to omit in <HI>Media</HI> the Rivers <HI>Cy∣rus, Cambyses, Amardus, Strato,</HI> and <HI>Corindas:</HI> Of <HI>China, Cantao</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the Chief Mountains of <HI>Asia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Principal Mountains of <HI>Asia</HI> are in <HI>Colchis,</HI> under the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, <HI>Corax:</HI> Not to speak of <HI>Caucasus,</HI> which is accounted part of the Moun∣tain <HI>Taurus;</HI> as likewise <HI>Imaus</HI> in <HI>Scythia;</HI> in <HI>Me∣dia, Coronus, Jasonius, Orontes, Zagrus,</HI> and <HI>Choa∣tras:</HI> In <HI>Galatia, Olgasis, Didymus,</HI> and that call'd <HI>The Tomb of the Celaeni:</HI> In <HI>Bithynia, Orminius:</HI> In <HI>Phrygia,</HI> the greater <HI>Cadmus:</HI> In <HI>Mysia,</HI> the lesser Mount <HI>Ida:</HI> In <HI>Lydia, Sipylus, Tmolus, Mesogys,</HI> and <HI>Mimas;</HI> In <HI>Caria, Phaenix, Mycale,</HI> and <HI>Lar∣mus:</HI> In <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> Mount <HI>Libanus, Antilibanus,</HI> and <HI>Carmelius:</HI> In <HI>Antiochia, Casius</HI> and <HI>Pieria:</HI> In <HI>Mesopotamia, Masius</HI> and <HI>Singaras:</HI> In <HI>Arabla Petraea, Sinai</HI> and <HI>Horeb:</HI> In the Isle of <HI>Cyprur,</HI> Mount <HI>Olympus:</HI> In <HI>Palaestine,</HI> Mount <HI>Gilead.</HI> But the Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> which extends from the Coast of <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> over against that of the Isle of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> through the whole length of <HI>Asia,</HI> as already specified, is certainly the biggest Moun∣tain not onely of <HI>Asia,</HI> but of the whole World, if it be not rather a Conjuncture of several Moun∣tains into one; for so it seems to be, by taking se∣veral Names, as it passeth through several Pla∣ces; as, <HI>Imaus, Emodus, Parapomisus, Circius, Chambades, Pharphariades, Croates, Oreges, Oroan∣des, Niphates, Caucasus, Sarpedon, Coracesius, Cra∣gus,</HI> and at last <HI>Taurus</HI> again. Those Gaps where the Mountain divides, and affords Passage through, are call'd <HI>Pylae, i. e.

<HEAD>Of the Productions of <HI>Asia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NO wonder the Luxury of the <HI>Persian</HI> Empire still overcame those that were Conquerors by the Sword, as being anciently the Chiefest, and still one of the Principal Kingdoms of that Quarter of the World; which besides its fruitfulness of all things necessary for Humane Sustenance, produ∣ces also all those richest of Commodities that have in all Ages been sought for from other the remotest Parts of the Earth; and which, especi∣ally at this day, now that much more of <HI>Asia</HI> is discover'd than was formerly known, render the <HI>Levantine</HI> Trade the richest and most flourishing of all others.</P>
<P>The Ancients were not silent of the great Riches of <HI>Asia;</HI> but seem'd not to have that parti∣cular knowledge thereof, that the late Voyages, and the Relations of those who Traffick thither, give us. <HI>Pliny</HI> writes of great Quantities of Crystal found in several Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> particularly at <HI>Ala∣banda</HI> and <HI>Orthosia;</HI> and <HI>Xenocrates</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> is quo∣ted by him to affirm, That in the Isle of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and divers Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> great Pieces of Crystal have been thrown up in the Plowing of Lands. The same <HI>Pliny</HI> makes mention of the Stones <HI>Alabastrites</HI> and <HI>Coralliticus,</HI> the first to be found about <HI>Damas∣cus</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> the other in some other Parts of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Solinus</HI> having describ'd those two rich Gums of <HI>Arabia,</HI> Frankincence and Myrrh, and those two rare Birds, the <HI>Phoenix</HI> and <HI>Cinnamolgus,</HI> comes to speak of the Gems or Precious Stones of this Country, and in particular of that famous <HI>Sardo∣nix</HI> Stone which from the Coast of <HI>Arabia</HI> was presented to <HI>Polycrates</HI> King of <HI>Samus.</HI> The other Stones he mentions, are the <HI>Molochites,</HI> something resembling in Colour a <HI>Smaragdus</HI> or <HI>Emerald,</HI> onely of a deeper Green; the <HI>Iris,</HI> so call'd be∣cause held in the Sun, it represents all the Co∣lours of the Rain-bow; the <HI>Androdamas,</HI> so call'd as partaking something of the Nature of the <HI>Adamant,</HI> or else because it abates the force of Anger and Passion; and the <HI>Paederotes,</HI> a very beautiful Stone, and by some thought to be the same with the <HI>Opal.</HI> Neither forgets he the Bal∣som of <HI>Judaea,</HI> which indeed is generally account∣ed the richest of all other Balsoms (not that of <HI>Peru</HI> it self excepted:) nor in <HI>India</HI> the Pepper and <HI>Eben</HI>-wood which are produc'd about Mount

<P>But at present, as there is much more of <HI>India,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> discover'd, than was for∣merly; so we have a more perfect and certain Account of all the Chief Places of Trade, and what the peculiar Productions and Exportations are of the several Provinces and <HI>Emporiums</HI> of <HI>Persia, India, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Olearius. <HI>Tobacco in</HI> Asia.</NOTE> For the Province of <HI>Chilan</HI> in <HI>Persia</HI> abounds with Silk, Oyl, Wine, Rice, To∣bacco, Lemons, Oranges, Pomegranates, and other the most delicious sorts of Fruit. The Pro∣vinces of <HI>Iruan, Nachtxuan, Kerabath, Aderbeit∣zan,</HI> and <HI>Chorasan,</HI> bring forth in very great plen∣ty Cotton, which the <HI>Persians</HI> call <HI>Pambeh.</HI> The Trade of Pearl-fishing is most especially eminent in three Places, near the Isle of <HI>Baharem</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Sea, near the Isle of <HI>Manar</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>India,</HI> and near that of <HI>Ainan</HI> towards <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Near the City <HI>Saha,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Erac,</HI> grows abundance of Cotton and Rice, in which the Inhabitants drive a great Trade.</P>
<P>In the City <HI>Katschan</HI> is a great Trade driven of Silk Stuffs, and Gold and Silver <HI>Brocados.</HI> At <HI>Caswin,</HI> the Chief City of <HI>Erac,</HI> are bought <HI>Tur∣queses,</HI> which the Natives call <HI>Firuse</HI> (and which are found near <HI>Nisabur</HI> and <HI>Firusku</HI>) as also Rubies and Granats, very cheap. At <HI>Scamachie,</HI> the Principal City of <HI>Media Atropatia,</HI> the Chief Commerce lies in Stuffs of Silk and Cotton, as also Gold and Silver <HI>Brocadoes,</HI> and rich Scymi∣tars. The Provinces of <HI>Kilan</HI> and <HI>Sahetzan</HI> are noted for Silks. Near <HI>Baku</HI> are several Sources of <HI>Nefie.</HI> From the Salt-pits of <HI>Kutb, Urum, Kemre, Hemedan, Bisethun, Suldus,</HI> and <HI>Kilissim,</HI> there is drawn out great quantity of Salt as clear as Cry∣stal.</P>

<P>The Isle of <HI>Ceilon</HI> produces Cinnamon, all sorts of Precious Stones except Diamonds, Pearls somewhat-inferior to those of <HI>Baharam;</HI> but the best Ivory of the World. It abounds also in all sorts of rich Fruits, as <HI>Ananas, Bananas, Cocos, Jacques, Mangas,</HI> Citrons; and hath whole Fo∣rests of Oranges and Lemons, and also Mines of Brass and Iron, and, it is thought, of Gold and Silver, especially in the Kingdom of <HI>Candy.</HI> The Soil also is very Productive of Corn, Wine, Oyl, Cotton, several Roots for Dyers, Ginger, Nutmegs, <HI>Cardamoms, Mirobalans, Corcoma,</HI> and divers other Medicinal Drugs.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>India,</HI> the Chief City of the Province <HI>Odya,</HI> the principal Commerce consists in Stuffs brought from <HI>Suratta</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> all sorts of <HI>China</HI> Commodities, Pre∣cious Stones, Gold, <HI>Benzoin,</HI> Wax, Copper, Lead, <HI>Indico, Calamba</HI> Wood, <HI>Brasil</HI> Wood, Cotton, Saphires, Rubies: Likewise great quan∣tities of Rice are hence transported to the neigh∣boring Islands, and Deer-skins to the <HI>Japoneses.</HI></P>

<P>Several Missions have been appointed by <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Princes for the Propagating of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion: that is to say; Those of <HI>Turkie,</HI> under the Protection of <HI>France;</HI> Those of <HI>India,</HI> under the Protection of <HI>Portugal;</HI> Those of the <HI>Philip∣pines,</HI> under the Protection of <HI>Castile.</HI> In the <HI>East-Indies</HI> are four Archbishopricks, and seven Bishopricks: There also the <HI>Jesuits</HI> have three Provinces; that of <HI>Goa,</HI> that of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and that of <HI>Japan.</HI> From <HI>France</HI> the Bishops of <HI>He∣liopolis, Metellopolis, Beritus,</HI> and <HI>Coesarea</HI> were sent to propagate the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion in <HI>China.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF THE KINGDOM OF PERSIA.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Kingdom of <HI>Persia</HI> hath for se∣veral Ages by that Name been known to the an∣cient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> and at this Day to most People of <HI>Europe;</HI> and it may pro∣perly be so call'd from <HI>Perseus,</HI> Son of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Danae.</HI> The In∣habitants term it <HI>Agem,</HI> or <HI>Agiam.</HI> By the <HI>Turks</HI> it is call'd <HI>Agem Vilager,</HI> or <HI>Agem Memlaket;</HI> the first signifies <HI>The Countrey,</HI> and, the second <HI>The King∣dom of the Persians:</HI> But the proper Name, as <HI>Texeira</HI> affirms, is <HI>Agem</HI> or <HI>Pars;</HI> and that of the Inhabitants, <HI>Parsey</HI> or <HI>Agemy,</HI> though the Name of <HI>Pars</HI> belongs peculiarly to the Province of <HI>Per∣sia.</HI> It was anciently a Noble and very famous Country, having for two hundred and thirty Years been the Head of the second Monarchy; nay, it rose to that heighth, that (according to <HI>Brisonius</HI>) no Kingdom upon Earth could either in Power or Riches compare with it; wherefore the Governors were call'd <HI>The Great Kings,</HI> or <HI>Kings of Kings,</HI> as appears by <HI>Plato, Strabo, Suetonius,</HI> and other eminent Writers.</P>
<P>The Borders of this Kingdom formerly extend∣ed very far, many populous Provinces being under its Jurisdiction, as (amongst other Remarks) ap∣pear'd by the great Army, and the mighty Train thereto belonging, with which King <HI>Darius</HI> pre∣par'd to oppose <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as <HI>Quintus Cur∣tius</HI> hath related at large.</P>
<P>How far the Limits of this Empire anciently extended, may be found in <HI>Strabo, Pizarrus,</HI> and other ancient Writers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its ancient Limits and Extent.</NOTE><HI>Persia</HI> in former Times compris'd most of the Countries of <HI>Asia</HI> towards the East, as also a part of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> which then was within the Bounds of <HI>Asia, viz.</HI> it extended in length from the <HI>Hellespont</HI> beyond the Mouth of the River <HI>In∣dus,</HI> two thousand eight hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles; and in breadth, from the <HI>Pontus</HI> to the Jaws of the <HI>Arabian Gulf,</HI> two thousand: in which Circumfe∣rence were comprehended many Provinces and Kingdoms. But since the downfall of the second Monarchy of <HI>Persia,</HI> which flourish'd two hundred and thirty years from the first rise thereof by <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>This Kingdom, partly by Intestine Wars, and partly by the Invasion of Forein Princes, was so much abated in its former Splendor, that the Inhabitants thereof were absolutely enslav'd, and after the <HI>Arabians</HI> had Conquer'd them, forc'd to deny their Name, and from that time forward were not permitted to style themselves <HI>Persians,</HI> but <HI>Saracens.</HI> Not long after which it was sub∣du'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and first brought under Sub∣jection of the <HI>Chinguis Chan,</HI> and then under <HI>Ta∣merlane;</HI> yet at length it began again to flourish, and regain'd much of its ancient Lustre in the last Age, by the Valour of <HI>Ismael Sefi,</HI> and is now rec∣kon'd amongst the most powerful Monarchies of the East.</P>
<P>As to the present Extent of <HI>Persia,</HI> it cannot certainly be said, because of the various Alterati∣ons in the Frontiers, by means of the War against the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> divers times losing a Pro∣vince
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>or two, and sometimes regaining them, or others in lieu thereof, from the Enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Extent of <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE><HI>Olearius,</HI> from his observation of the <HI>Persian</HI> Maps, makes <HI>Persia</HI> to extend (taking in all the circumjacent subdu'd Provinces) from the North to the South, from the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Persia;</HI> from East to West, from the Borders of <HI>Candahar</HI> to the River <HI>Euphrates</HI> or <HI>Moratsu;</HI> nay, it extends half way on the West side, from the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> upward, to the <HI>Armenian</HI> Mountains; and Eastward towards the River <HI>Ruth Chane,</HI> for∣merly <HI>Oxun;</HI> on the North side whereof dwell the <HI>Usbeki</HI> and <HI>Bucharian Tartars,</HI> who partly pay Tribute to the <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maginus</HI> makes <HI>Persia</HI> extend from East to West 38 Degrees, because its Longitude from the Meri∣dian of <HI>Tenariff,</HI> is in 82 Degrees, and the most Eastern in 129. but from the North to the South, to 20 Degrees, <HI>viz.</HI> from the 23. to the 43. De∣gree: So that the Dominion of <HI>Persia</HI> hath five hundred and sixty Leagues in length, and three hundred in breadth, a Degree being reckon'd to contain eighteen <HI>German,</HI> or sixty <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Cluverius</HI> and <HI>Golnitius,</HI> it makes out the same length, reckoning from <HI>Araxis</HI> to the River <HI>Indus,</HI> a thousand eight hundred and forty <HI>English</HI> Miles and the breadth, from <HI>Oxus</HI> to the <HI>Persian Sea,</HI> eight hundred and ten.</P>
<P><HI>Botteras</HI> makes the breadth from North to South to be eighteen Degrees, a Tract of eight hundred and ten Miles.</P>
<P>But <HI>Olearius</HI> confutes all these Writers in this Point, and affirms, That <HI>Persia</HI> hath 12 Degrees in breadth from North to South; for if you take the utmost Limits or Corners which lie at both the opposite Seas, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> and <HI>Persi∣an Gulf,</HI> you will find that the City <HI>Hasum,</HI> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Resht,</HI> is situate scarce two Leagues from the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> under 37 Deg. and <HI>Ormus</HI> at the <HI>Persian Gulf</HI> in 25 Degrees; so that the extent of this breadth is but 12 Degrees, a Tract of two hundred and eighty <HI>German</HI> Miles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Borders.</NOTE>This Kingdom hath for Borders in the East, the River <HI>Indus,</HI> the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Countrey, as also the Countrey of <HI>Zakatey;</HI> On the West it contermi∣nates with <HI>Diarbek</HI> and <HI>Great Armenia,</HI> the Coun∣tries of the <HI>Turks,</HI> the River <HI>Tigris,</HI> and the Lake <HI>Giocho;</HI> on the North it verges with the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> or <HI>Bachu,</HI> besides the <HI>Tartars</HI> from <HI>Usbeki</HI> or <HI>Zagatey,</HI> and a part of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to the <HI>Eder</HI> or <HI>Vola;</HI> and on the South is partly wash'd by the <HI>Persian Gulf,</HI> the rest limiting with <HI>Ormus</HI> and a lit∣tle part of the <HI>Indian Sea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cluverius</HI> affirms, That the Empire of <HI>Persia</HI> is on the North inclos'd with the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> the Ri∣ver <HI>Oxos,</HI> and <HI>Mount Caucasus;</HI> on the East, with the River <HI>Indus;</HI> in the South, with the <HI>Indian Sea</HI> and <HI>Persian Gulf;</HI> and in the West, with the <HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tigris,</HI> the <HI>Nifean</HI> Mountains, and River <HI>Araxis.</HI></P>
<P>The same Borders are set down by <HI>Golnitius, viz.</HI> on the East, the Stream <HI>Indus,</HI> and a part of <HI>Tartary;</HI> on the North, the <HI>Tartars,</HI> besides the <HI>Oxos</HI> and the <HI>Caspian Sea;</HI> on the West, the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Lake <HI>Giocho</HI> and <HI>Euphrates, Tigris</HI> and <HI>Araxis;</HI> and on the South, the <HI>Persian Gulf</HI> call'd <HI>Elkatist,</HI> and the <HI>Indian Sea.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Province of <HI>Persia</HI> or <HI>Fars.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Province of <HI>Persia,</HI> (anciently call'd <HI>Persis</HI>) from which the whole Kingdom is so call'd, is in the Country Language nam'd <HI>Fars</HI> and <HI>Farsistan;</HI> which last properly signifies <HI>The Country of Fars;</HI> for <HI>Stam</HI> in the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Tongue generally signifies <HI>A Country. Niger,</HI> besides several others call it <HI>Azamia,</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> according to <HI>Megisser, Farsik.</HI> It is a great Country, and hath on the East the two <HI>Carmania;</HI> the West part thereof borders at <HI>Susiana,</HI> now call'd <HI>Suse</HI> or <HI>Suster,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Kusistan;</HI> the North verges with <HI>Media,</HI> now <HI>Sarch;</HI> and the South shoots to the <HI>Persian Bay</HI> or Sea of <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The Coast of <HI>Persia</HI> is every where an open and sandy Plains, and without Harbors; yet the In∣habitants call all those Places where Boats can put in, <HI>Brendor,</HI> that is, <HI>A Haven.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea-Coast of this Province comprehends the Country inhabited by the <HI>Nautaques, Arabi∣ans,</HI> and <HI>Mihelus</HI> or <HI>Nichilu,</HI> which have their Name from that Sea-Coast, and maintain them∣selves by Piracies: They pay Tribute to the <HI>Sefi;</HI> yet some of them own the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and Sail freely with their Passes, which secures them from being molested by the <HI>Portuguese Carraks.</HI></P>
<P>On the Bay of <HI>Persia</HI> stands the Fort <HI>Rexel;</HI> and more Northward into the Country lies <HI>Resh Cey∣fadin,</HI> that is, <HI>The Tract of Sand of Ceyfadin.</HI></P>
<P>The Metropolis of this Province is <HI>Schiras,</HI> by the <HI>Italians</HI> and Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> nam'd <HI>Siras,</HI> and (according to Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI>) from the pronunciati∣on of the <HI>Persians</HI> themselves, <HI>Scheraz.</HI> By reason of its Situation on a Plain, some term it <HI>Imurezam,</HI> that is, <HI>A Plain-City. Ben Jonas</HI> calls it <HI>Syahaz; Osirus, Niras; Sephanus, Cynebatha;</HI> and <HI>Ctelius, Cyropolis,</HI> though mistaken, as Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> affirms, because all the ancient Geographers place the City of <HI>Ciropolis</HI> near the River <HI>Cyrus</HI> in <HI>Hyrcania,</HI> lying in 39 Degrees and a half Northern Lati∣tude, whereas <HI>Sciras</HI> lies in 28 Degrees and 44 Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Aelian</HI> affirms, That there is a <HI>Ciropolis</HI> in <HI>In∣dia,</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> hath observ'd a River of the same Denomination in <HI>Armenia;</HI> but none of the An∣cients make mention of any City of that Name: yet nevertheless <HI>Garcias de Sylva</HI> and <HI>Fiqueroa</HI> certainly believes <HI>Schiras</HI> to be the ancient City of <HI>Ciropolis,</HI> lying in the Province of <HI>Pasargadas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Herbert</HI> would have <HI>Scheraz</HI> to be deriv'd from the word <HI>Sheer,</HI> which signifies <HI>Milk</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue; or else from <HI>Sherap,</HI> which is <HI>A Bunch of Grapes;</HI> for no Place in all <HI>Asia</HI> affords better Vines.</P>
<P>Some, but especially <HI>Philips</HI> of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> would have <HI>Sciras</HI> to be the ancient City <HI>Persepolis,</HI> or at least that <HI>Sciras</HI> was built out of its Ruins on the same Foundation: but this is a grand Mistake, because <HI>Schiras</HI> is not an ancient City, and the Place where <HI>Persepolis</HI> stood, is above ten <HI>Persian</HI> Miles to the Northward from <HI>Schiras:</HI> Yet ne∣vertheless Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> affirms, that <HI>Schiras</HI> was rai∣sed out of the Ruins of <HI>Persepolis.</HI></P>
<P>Some ascribe the building of this City to <HI>Jam∣shid,</HI> fifth King of <HI>Persia,</HI> who (as the Chronicle makes mention) was succeeded by <HI>Chedorlaomer,</HI> not long after the Death of <HI>Noah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Botterus</HI> tells us, That <HI>Schiras</HI> was built when <HI>Grand-Cair</HI> was but a Village; but according to the Registers of the Country, it was built not above seven hundred and fifty years ago, a consi∣derable time after the <HI>Arabians</HI> made themselves Masters of <HI>Persia.</HI> Moreover, if ancient Traditi∣ons may be credited, which are there certainly believ'd, this City is much elder, especially if it be true what is related of an <HI>Asian</HI> General call'd <HI>Jenpsit,</HI> who is said to have liv'd many Ages be∣fore their Account of Time: And though they differ amongst themselves in the Time and Reign of the foremention'd Heroe, yet 'tis very proba∣ble that he liv'd a thousand years after the <HI>Flood.</HI> They affirm that he was the Person who made the great and strange cut Channel, which so abun∣dantly waters the whole Country of <HI>Schiras,</HI> by undermining and cutting through the great Moun∣tains that lie between the City and Springs, and thereby brought them to their present Perfection; and by this means they furnish the City with such an abundance of Water, that if all the Channels were cut into one, they would make a very large River.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Schiras,</HI> lying in 28 Degrees and 44 Minutes Northern Latitude, is situate about ten Leagues from the Ruins of <HI>Persepolis;</HI> near the Stream <HI>Bendamir</HI> or <HI>Bendimir,</HI> on a great Plain in∣clos'd with Mountains (except on the side where you go over a Bridge from <HI>Pasa</HI> into the same) two Leagues distant from the City, but on the North scarce half a League.</P>
<P>This City was formerly much bigger, and had many more magnificent Buildings than at this day, as plainly appears both within and without its Walls: And the <HI>Arabian</HI> Geographer <HI>Ulug Becig,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> affirms that it was in his Time three Leagues and a half in Circumfe∣rence. The like bigness <HI>Contasing</HI> ascribes to the same, as also the number of twenty four thousand Houses.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this Age <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> to punish the Insurrection of one <HI>Jacob Chan,</HI> Gover∣nor or Lord of <HI>Schiras,</HI> pull'd down that part of the Wall which was then remaining, and fill'd up the Moat and Trench which surrounded the City.</P>
<P>Both without and within the City are many <HI>Mosques</HI> or Temples, amongst which some are built very magnificent and beautiful, and especially one, which being of an extraordinary bigness, hath a much higher Steeple upon it than any of the other. These Towers, which the <HI>Persians</HI> call <HI>Al∣corons,</HI> are narrow, but high, having without two or three Galleries one above another; from whence the <HI>Marabouts</HI> (a sort of Priests) publickly read their Prayers with a loud and strong Voice three times a day, and walking round about the Gallery, that they may be the better understood.</P>
<P>There are very few handsom Structures either without or within the City, except the <HI>Mosques;</HI> for besides three Royal Palaces, (of which one is in the City, and the other two in the Suburbs) there is not one fair House: 'tis true, that of the <HI>Chan</HI> or <HI>Sultan,</HI> thoug it be not very beautiful on the out-side, yet large, and hath many Painted and richly Gilded Apartments within, besides Galleries, Gardens, Orchards, and pleasant
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>Walks. All the other, inhabited by Citizens and other eminent Persons, are small and mean; the Rooms, except the Hall and two or three Chambers, are so little, that an indifferent Trades∣man here, hath better Accommodation than a Nobleman there.</P>
<P>The City hath several Gates, one of which re∣spects the River <HI>Pasargadas,</HI> and is call'd <HI>Darva∣za Pasa,</HI> that is, <HI>The Gate of Pasa,</HI> anciently <HI>Pasarga∣das:</HI> it is very little, and supported only by the Relicks of an old Mud Wall. Opposite to this Gate, towards the West, is another call'd <HI>Dar∣vaza Achem,</HI> that is, <HI>Iron Gate,</HI> at which begins a very fair Street above 2000 Paces long, and every where exactly 90 Paces broad. On each side of this Street is a Wall of about sixteen Foot high, Plaister'd over with Mortar, and without any Houses; behind are spacious Gardens and Or∣chards, full of Fruit-trees and curious Banquet∣ing-houses, which belong to the King, and are neatly built, with large Galleries and pleasant Prospects.</P>
<P>In this fair Street the <HI>Persians</HI> run Races, and perform their Exercises on Horseback. At the end of the Streets stands the King's Palace, very handsomly built, with Balconies and Terrace Walks. Before the Court you ascend by two Steps to a little Plain, which is rais'd higher than the Street. At the Entrance, and near the Gal∣lery, in the midst of the Plain, lies a fair and large Pool of Water.</P>
<P>Most of the Inhabitants of the City appear every Friday, being the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Sabbath, in a spacious Plain, both on Foot and Horseback, and are there Exercis'd and Train'd, and afterwards dispose themselves to other Recreations as they think fit.</P>
<P>Near the King's Palace is a fair House with a pleasant Garden, the Work of the Great <HI>Ismael Sofi,</HI> very curiously built three Stories high; in the second of which, among other very conveni∣ent Apartments, is a large and spacious Hall, ha∣ving in the middle an Arch'd <HI>Lover,</HI> full of Glass Windows. In this Apartment, as also in the rest on this Story, are divers Pictures of Women, most of them Cloth'd after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner.</P>
<P>Under the Galleries which surround this Stru∣cture, two are much bigger than the other; one of which being over the Gate looks into the Street, and also to that Gate of the City which is call'd <HI>Darvaza Pasa.</HI> The other standing above the first, is over the Gate, through which you pass to go into the Garden, and respects the West. Each of these have three Doors one against another, so that being in the Hall, which is in the middle of the Edifice, you have the Prospect not only of the foremention'd Streets and Walks, but also of the City Gate, and that of the <HI>Haram</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI> in the middle of the Garden, which may justly be accounted a Wood of all sorts of Fruit-trees, di∣vided into Walks, but those of the Cypress and Palm are the chiefest, which begin at the Court Gate, and extend nine hundred Paces in length, and thirty in breadth; the Walks are very straight and even Planted on both sides with tall Cypress-trees, which are so big that three Men can scarce fathom them, and so high and straight, that they represent great Obelisks. At the bot∣tom of the Trees is rais'd a Gravel Path or Bank, somewhat higher than the middle Walk, and a∣bout five or six Foot broad, where all People walk; for they go not into the middle part, be∣cause that must be kept always green. At the bottom of these Cypress-trees, on the out-side of the Walk, runs a pleasant Brook, which after∣wards dividing it self into several Branches, wa∣ters all parts of the Garden. At the end of the Walk is the <HI>Haram</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI> built after the same manner as the House before mention'd, but not so large nor high: It is erected on a Plain rais'd seven Foot higher than the Garden. On each side of this Structure is forty Foot of Ground, in which are ten eight-square Ponds, which are each half a Fathom deep, to serve the House with Water. This Edifice is not cover'd with Tyles, but with Lome and chopt Straw or Chaff, which being temper'd together and bak'd, becomes so hard that no Water will soke through, but runs off into Gutters join'd to the Wells. On this Roof, as also on those of all other Houses, stands a Marble Pillar of about three or four Foot long, and one thick. On the top of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> you have a Prospect of the whole Garden, as also a cool walking-place in the hot Summer Nights.</P>
<P>This Garden affords all sorts of <HI>European</HI> Fruits, but especially Pears, and Grapes of divers sorts, beautiful to the Eye, and very large; also Pista∣cho's, Almonds, and Filberds.</P>
<P>Sixty or seventy Paces from the <HI>Haram</HI> appears a square Fountain, with a handsom Ascent; each Square is about a hundred Foot long, and Wall'd with Marble; also fill'd with Water, in which are kept two Pleasure-boats for the Women to recreate themselves with.</P>
<P>All the Walks are on both sides Hedg'd in with <HI>Province</HI>-Roses, out of which they Distill abun∣dance of Rose-water, and send it in great quanti∣ties to <HI>Ormus,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and other remote Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>In this large Garden are abundance of great Pheasants, Woodcocks, and other Fowls, which are there as in a Cage, breeding and hatching up their Young.</P>
<P>Ten Leagues from <HI>Schiras</HI> is a Village call'd <HI>Maragaskan,</HI> otherwise <HI>Mardash;</HI> it lies in 28 De∣grees and 48 Minutes Northern Latitude, four League North-West from the Village <HI>Mahin;</HI> between which the Way is very straight, pleasant, and delightful, being overgrown with Grass. This Village contains about two hundred Houses, so inclos'd with Trees, that at a distance it appears to be a Wood divided into several small Parks. The Air thereabouts is very temperate, and the Water good and fresh, besides which all sorts of Provisi∣ons very cheap.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Mardash,</HI> at the end of a neighboring Plain, nigh the Foot of a high Mountain not far from the Brook <HI>Sirt,</HI> may be seen the Ruins of an old Ca∣stle, in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Tzehilminar,</HI> that is, <HI>Forty Towers,</HI> though at this Day only thirty of them remain, <HI>viz.</HI> nineteen high ones, and eleven broken ones; but (as <HI>Della Valle</HI> affirms) there are not above twenty, which may be true, and the Place not misnam'd; for though now so few re∣main, without doubt there were more at first, the <HI>Persian</HI> word <HI>Thehil</HI> signifying <HI>Fort,</HI> and <HI>Minar A Tower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Joseph Barbaro</HI> affirms, that the Towers before mention'd are as big as three Men can Fathom, and (as <HI>Mandeslo</HI> relates) consists of black and white Marble.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> relate, that this Edifice was erect∣ed
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>by a King call'd <HI>Tzemshied Schach,</HI> famous for Wisdom; but <HI>Olearius</HI> questions that. Others say That King <HI>Solomon</HI> built it: and some believe that <HI>Darius</HI> was the Founder thereof, and that <HI>Iskander,</HI> which is <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> ruin'd it: But <HI>Aelian</HI> ascribes the erecting thereof to King <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>The Foundation or Platform of this Structure is about eighty Yards, being cut out of an intire Rock of Marble: They ascend the same on four pair of Stairs, consisting of ninety five Steps; cut out of white Marble: On the top, not far from the Stairs, appear four Pieces of a broken Wall, that seem to have been two large Gates; on the first two are cut two great Horses, with strange Furni∣ture; and on the other two are other kind of Beasts, with Bodies like Horses, but Heads like Lyons with Crowns upon them, and Wings at their Shoulders. Not far from hence, on the right side, stand the thirty foremention'd Pillars. A lit∣tle distant from these Towers, and somewhat higher were two indifferent large Chambers, of which are remaining some of the Doors and Win∣dows, which are of Marble, as also the Walls, which are so polish'd, that one may see their Face therein as in a Looking-Glass. Farther in, on the side near the Doors, are all manner of ancient Shapes and Figures, hewn in Stone, and bigger than the Life, some sitting, others standing, with long Hair, broad Beards, and long Coats down to their Feet, with wide Sleeves, a Sash about their Middle, and strange round Caps on their Heads. Not far from these Chambers stands a square Pil∣lar, with a great polish'd Stone in the top, which some judge to be a Jasper; on this also, as on se∣veral other Columns, are strange Characters En∣graven which none can Read.</P>
<P>All that remains of the Relicks or Ruins of an∣cient <HI>Persepolis</HI> we find very well describ'd in Mr. <HI>Herbert,</HI> wherefore we shall give you the De∣scription in his following words:</P>
<Q><P>The Ribs or Ruins of <HI>Persepolis</HI> (saith he) are at this Day call'd <HI>Chill-Manor,</HI> or <HI>Chehel-Manor,</HI> that is, <HI>Forty Towers</HI> in the Idiom of <HI>Persia;</HI> and might more properly have said <HI>Hashtot-Manor,</HI> or <HI>Eighty Towers,</HI> for so many are easily told two Yards out of the Ground; and if from so many Pillars as are perfect and lofty, then may they say <HI>Nouzda-Manor,</HI> or <HI>Nineteen Towers,</HI> at this Day no more standing, one excepted at the East below, above a Bowe-shot thence. The whole Basis is cut by incredible toil out of the solid Marble Rock, twice the compass of <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, ascended by fourscore and fifteen easie Steps, dissected from the durable black Marble, so broad that a dozen Horses may go abreast: the Perpendicular is two and twenty Geome∣trick Feet, and where the Stairs are not, the Rock is precipitious: near the highest Step is the Entrance into the Palate; the Breadth is visible, in despight of Flame and Weather: on one side of the Gate stands a monstrous great Elephant, on the other a Rhinoceros; the di∣stance is about twenty Foot; the Portraicts are cut out of the shining Marble, ten Yards high either of them, fixt and perpetual. A few Paces thence are of like Work, Bulk, and Matter, two gallant Towers; and (to finish the Porter's Lodge) near them is another Ruine, a <HI>Pegasus,</HI> an Invention of the Sculptor to illustrate his Art: And being past this Portal, the <HI>Apollo</HI> opens, a fair even Ground, deplorable in many Ruins, a hundred white Marble Pillars, whole and broken, dignifying this once most excellent Structure. Upon many of these white Marble Pillars the Storks have builded their Nests, where the rage of Wind and Weather is more offensive to them than any dread they have of the People who inhabit near them. In all un∣seasonable, stormy, or cold Weather, they for∣sake the Region, and fly where the Sun can com∣fort them. The <HI>Persians</HI> have many superstiti∣ous Stories concerning them, and suppose them (as else-where I have noted) the Emblems of Piety and Gratitude. The Pillars which are at this day standing (but seem to groan under the Tyranny of Time) are betwixt fifteen and twenty Cubits, and rise beautifully in forty Squares or concave Parallels, every Square ha∣ving full three Inches, whereby the Circuit may be gather'd. Most excellent is the Matter, most elegant the Work, and no less commenda∣ble the Order and Shape how they are plac'd; in posture and shew to this day admirable; but when they stood in lustre and perfection, were elsewhere scarce imitable. From the ordinary standing, we easily enjoy'd a most delightful Prospect; but in the Summity or Advantage, a brave Horizon of thirty Miles unlimited Plains, every way gave it self to this Imperial Palace, as seeming to submit it self in a happy lowli∣ness.</P>
<P>In part of this great Room (not far from the Portal) in a Mirror of polish'd Marble, we noted above a dozen Lines of strange Characters, very fair, and apparent to the Eye; but so mystical, so odly fram'd, as no <HI>Hieroglyphick,</HI> no other deep Conceit can be more difficultly fancied, more adverse to the Intellect. These consisting of Figures Obelisk, Triangular, and Pyramidal, yet in such Symetry and Order as cannot well be call'd Barbarous: Some resemblance I fan∣cied some Words had of the Antique <HI>Greek,</HI> sha∣dowing out <HI>Ahasuerus Theos:</HI> And though it have small concordance with the <HI>Hebrew, Greek,</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> Letter, yet questionless to the Inventer it was well known, and peradventure may con∣ceal some excellent Matter, though to this day wrapt up in the dim Leaves of envious Obscu∣rity.</P>
<P>Adjoyning this, is another square Room, from Angle to Angle ninety Paces, in circuit three hundred and threescore Paces, beautified with eight Doors, four of them being six Paces broad, and the other four, three apiece; all eight severally compos'd of seven great polish'd Marbles, fix'd one upon another; each of which Stones are four Yards long, five Quarters high, and most excellently engraven with Ima∣ges of Lions, Griffins, Tygers, and Bulls: and in other Places (for the Walls are durable) Bat∣tels, Hecatombs, Triumphs, Olympick Games, and the like, in very rare Sculpture and Propor∣tion. Above each Door is engraven the Idea of a Majestick Monarch; his Robe is long, a <HI>Tiara</HI> or <HI>Mithra</HI> on his Head, his Hair very long, and curl'd; in one Hand he holds a Globe, in the other his Scepter: A Garb and Session never us'd by <HI>Persian</HI> Princes. The silly Inhabitants (who made no account of it till of late) name him <HI>Jamshet,</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and <HI>Samson,</HI> and <HI>Solo∣mon:</HI> A wonder they leave out <HI>Rustan,</HI> their <HI>Hercules,</HI> and as easie for invention. A third
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>Chamber conjoyns the last we spoke of: This (if they lie not that told us so) was a <HI>Gynecie,</HI> or Nursery. It has four unequal Angles; two sides are sixty, the other two seventy of my largest Paces. From that, we issued into a fourth Room, two sides whereof are twenty, and the other two, thirty Paces. The Walls are very eminent in this Chamber, of black shining Marble, in ma∣ny Places so bright and jetty, as we could easily view our Reflex, no Steel Mirror comparing with it. In most parts the Walls are cut into Gygantive Images, illustrated with Gold, to this day permanent. Somewhat further, over Heaps of Stones of valuable Portraictures, we mount towards the most lofty part of this Pa∣lace, where we saw the Resemblances of a de∣vout King, adoring his three Deities, the Sun, the Fire, and a Serpent, all which are cut upon the perpendicular Mountain. The other side of this high Hill is a Precipice, down which is no descending. But whether this Fabrick was <HI>Ionick, Dorick,</HI> or <HI>Corinthiack,</HI> in the perfection, I cannot determine; the Ruins forbid a positive Judgment. But such at this day it is, that a rea∣dy Limner in three Months space can hardly (to do it well) depict out all her Excellencies. Pi∣ty it is, it is not done, the barbarous People eve∣ry day defacing it, and cleaving it asunder for Grave-stones and Benches to sit upon. Five Miles West from <HI>Chehel-manor</HI> is also a gallant Monument, a Giant cut into a monstrous pro∣portion, whom the Illiterate <HI>Persians</HI> say was <HI>Rustan,</HI> and from him call'd <HI>Nocta-Rustan.</HI> I rather judge it the Image of Great <HI>Alexander,</HI> who had a desire that after-Ages might think him more than a Man, and his Men more than Monsters, as appear'd in his Conceit to make many Armors big enough for three Men, and scatter them in <HI>India,</HI> that the People might not dare to rebell, lest those <HI>Polyphems</HI> came to lash them. So far Mr. <HI>Herbert.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Some suppose this Edifice to have been a Tem∣ple; others, a part of the Royal Court, or a Bu∣rying-place for the Kings: but <HI>Della Valle</HI> inclines to the first of these Opinions. This Ruine is, in truth, all that is left or the ancient City <HI>Persepolis,</HI> being burnt by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> to satisfie the Humor of his Concubine <HI>Thais.</HI></P>
<P>At the Foot of the Mountains, a League Northward from <HI>Hhehel-manor,</HI> are several old Images by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Nocsci Rostam,</HI> that is, <HI>The Figures of Rostam,</HI> who was an anci∣ent <HI>Persian Heroe,</HI> for his notable Exploits and great Atchievements, very famous in their Histo∣ries, as <HI>Hercules</HI> among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> and said to have liv'd in the Reign of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Cam∣byses.</HI></P>
<P>Near these are also carv'd on a large and smooth Rock several other Statues or Images; one where∣of sitting on Horse-back, is clad in a long Gar∣ment, with a Cap or Bonnet on his Head: In his left Hand he holds a Club, as <HI>Hercules</HI> is usually represented, and in his Right Hand a Ring, which another Horse-man that is plac'd near him also holds, both seeming to pull as if they would break it in sunder. This second Horse-man is cloath'd almost after the same manner with the first, but is bare-headed, and hath very long Hair. There is also in another place a third Horse-man, accou∣tred after the same manner, laying his left Hand on the Hilt of his Sword, his right Hand grasp∣ing the Sword of a Foot-man that stands before him, threatning as it were another Foot-man, who is bare-headed, and kneeling on one Knee before the Horse-man.</P>
<P>Not far from hence are seen the Representati∣ons of several Women, of which the Inhabitants relate many Fables, but especially of one, who they say was the Mistress of their Renowned <HI>Ro∣stam.</HI></P>
<P>On another side of this Rock, which is very steep like a Wall, are many Holes like Win∣dows, a great distance from the Ground, and some bigger than others; yet the least are so large, that a Man may easily lie at length in them: and therefore it is very probable that these Holes serv'd for Places of Interment for the Dead; for <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> affirms, That the ancient Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> were buried in the Country about <HI>Per∣sepolis,</HI> in Holes cut in high Rocks, into which they were lifted with Engines made for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>On another adjacent Mountain there is, as <HI>Della Valle</HI> relates, the Image of a Man call'd <HI>Gemschid,</HI> (or as others, <HI>Choscid,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Sun</HI>) who is said to have Reign'd a considerabe time in <HI>Persia</HI> before <HI>Cyrus the Great,</HI> and still lives in their Memory, for his great Knowledge in <HI>Necromancy.</HI> Some take this <HI>Gemscid</HI> to be <HI>Nebuchodonosor.</HI></P>
<P>About the City <HI>Schiras</HI> lie many Hamlets and Villages, as also several Lordships, call'd in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue <HI>Mulk,</HI> that is, <HI>Possessions,</HI> which are under one peculiar Family; for the Possessors thereof hold them not of the King, neither can he take them away.</P>
<P>On the North side of the City, as you go to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> lies a Mountain over which you travel along a Stony Road, through which runs a Stream which waters all the adjacent Gardens and Or∣chards.</P>
<P>Three Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Schiras</HI> stood a large <HI>Caravansera,</HI> which though half ru∣in'd, yet by its great Walls and Arches sufficient∣ly testifies its former Magnitude.</P>
<P>This Province contains four great Cities be∣sides <HI>Schiras, viz. Casirum, Bunitzan, Firusabath,</HI> and <HI>Astar;</HI> as also the Towns <HI>Arboy, Chiminar, Sa∣va,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Savas,</HI> formerly the Coun∣try of the <HI>Massabates:</HI> It comprises likewise <HI>Fi∣rusbate, Berdezzil, Senorgande, Cazaran,</HI> by <HI>Texei∣ra</HI> call'd <HI>Carriu,</HI> and by <HI>Ananie, Casrum;</HI> also <HI>Camara, Zemilen, Bendarepe, Serustan, Agiane, &amp;c. Texeira</HI> also places in this Province these Towns and Villages, <HI>viz. Tarum, Iaharom</HI> or <HI>Jarum, La∣sta</HI> or <HI>Lastan, Stahabanon, Neriz, Pacah, Daragued,</HI> and <HI>Duzgun,</HI> near <HI>Lastan,</HI> between <HI>Comoron</HI> and the City <HI>Lara,</HI> eighteen Leagues from <HI>Ormus.</HI> There are also the Cities of <HI>Rey</HI> and <HI>Gibal.</HI></P>
<P>The first City of this Province, according to <HI>Figueroa,</HI> is <HI>Guin,</HI> as also <HI>Benaru,</HI> with the Ruins of the Castle <HI>Gabriel,</HI> in the utmost Confines of the Kingdom of <HI>Lara;</HI> though both Places lie very near one another, in a great Plain. The City <HI>Guin</HI> is separated from the rest of <HI>Persia</HI> by high Mountains, over which you must travel to go to <HI>Jarum,</HI> and thence with the <HI>Caravans</HI> through the Desart.</P>
<P>It is apparent that this City hath been built many Years, and Peopled by a Colony of <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI> because the Inhabitants are of a better Spi∣rit, and more Morallised than the neighbouring wild <HI>Arabians:</HI> Their Complexion also is whiter,
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>and the Habit of the Women neater and more Civil. On the left Hand going from <HI>Guin</HI> lies a Village call'd <HI>Denia,</HI> full of fair Houses.</P>
<P>About two days Journey from <HI>Guin</HI> lies the lit∣tle City <HI>Horum,</HI> so call'd from its Beauty and great plenty of Dates; as also another of the same denomination, between <HI>Cabrestan</HI> and <HI>Lara.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Guin</HI> and <HI>Horum</HI> you meet with a bar∣ren and uninhabited Desart, of three days Jour∣ney, not having in all that way above two Pits of Water.</P>
<P>The Village <HI>Tarum,</HI> which is the Chief of ma∣ny Villages, was much decay'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1630. The Inhabitants thereof are subject to the Prince of <HI>Lar.</HI> It hath under its Jurisdiction the Village <HI>Seid Geuder,</HI> beyond which is a large Plain, and at a small distance runs the Brook <HI>Absciur,</HI> which signifies <HI>Salt Water.</HI> A little further is a Village call'd <HI>Pelengon,</HI> that is, <HI>A Panther;</HI> so nam'd from the great number of that sort of Beasts breeding thereabouts.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Pelengon</HI> you come to a narrow way between the Mountains, in the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Der Tenghi Cebar Rud,</HI> that is, <HI>The narrow Gate of four Streams;</HI> because in Rainy Weather four great Currents, which come from several Places, unite their Waters there.</P>
<P>After three or four Leagues travelling through a pleasant Way, you come to a Place call'd <HI>Curi∣hazirgon,</HI> that is, <HI>The Merchants Grave;</HI> perhaps so call'd because a Merchant died and was buried there. Four Leagues further lies a solitary and ruin'd Place, nam'd <HI>Ser Zehi Rizevon,</HI> about which stands onely a few Huts, shaded on one side by a Grove of Date-trees: And four Leagues further is <HI>Tastek,</HI> inhabited by none but the <HI>Rabdary</HI> or Watchmen to guard the Way.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Tastek,</HI> along an even Way between the Mountains, lies a Place call'd <HI>Abi Dungher,</HI> the utmost extent of the Dukedom of <HI>Lar,</HI> and the beginning of the Country which be∣long'd to the King of <HI>Ormus,</HI> when he was absolute Master of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Road from <HI>Schiras</HI> to <HI>Ispahan.</HI></NOTE>Travelling from <HI>Schiras</HI> to <HI>Hispahan,</HI> you pass by these Places: <HI>viz.</HI> First, the Village <HI>Zargan,</HI> in which is a handsom and well-built <HI>Mosque.</HI> Four Leagues further you come to <HI>Mahin,</HI> which being an open Town, contains between five and six hun∣dred Houses; but is so inclos'd with Gardens and Orchards of all sorts of Fruit-trees, that it rather seems at a distance a shady Grove than a Town.</P>
<P>A little forward from <HI>Mahin</HI> you come to ano∣ther Village call'd <HI>Amanzada,</HI> consisting onely of a few Houses, all enclosed within a Wall'd <HI>Ca∣ravansera,</HI> in which stands also a rich <HI>Pagode,</HI> out of whose Revenue all Travellers that rest there are maintain'd for three days.</P>
<P>The whole way from <HI>Mahin</HI> to this <HI>Caravansera</HI> is very craggy, and troublesom to travel, and is border'd on the left Hand by a high Mountain, whose top lies crown'd with Snow till the middle of Summer.</P>
<P>Three Leagues from <HI>Amanzada</HI> lies <HI>Ugion,</HI> a Village on a Plain; and between both, a very steep Mountain, whose Southern side is full of <HI>Lentisk</HI> Trees, out of which drops <HI>Mastick.</HI></P>
<P>In this Place stands a <HI>Mosque</HI> to which the Na∣tives shew great Reverence, by reason of a Tomb in which lies Interr'd one of <HI>Aly</HI>'s Successors; and the Villagers report, that many sick, blind, and decrepit People have receiv'd Health, and been restor'd to their Sight and Limbs, by imploring the aid of the foremention'd Person, whom they account a Saint. The Plain on which this Vil∣lage is situate is water'd by a small River, whose Stream, though muddy, is yet very full of Fish.</P>
<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Ugion</HI> is <HI>Acopas,</HI> a small Vil∣lage, enclos'd with a Mud-wall, and surrounded with high Mountains. In the middle of the Vil∣lage, on a Mount, stands a small decay'd Fort, round about which, and within the Walls, are above a hundred Houses, most of them Inhabi∣ted by <HI>Circassians.</HI> Hard by stands a large <HI>Cara∣vansera;</HI> and not far from it a Garden, planted with divers sorts of Fruit-trees, and curious Walks of Cypress and Palm-trees, which one <HI>Alavardy Chan</HI> planted a little before his death.</P>
<P>Four or five Leagues from <HI>Acopas</HI> lies <HI>Curcuzar,</HI> a small Fortified Town, with a <HI>Caravansera</HI> ad∣joyning. All the way between <HI>Acopas</HI> and <HI>Cur∣cuzar</HI> is low and Morassie; the Air also is unwhole∣som: Wherefore the <HI>Persians</HI> have not without great reason call'd this Place <HI>Curcuzar,</HI> which sig∣nifies <HI>Infectious Air.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond this is the Village <HI>Dergriger,</HI> three Leagues from which stands a <HI>Caravansera,</HI> and another pretty Town; next to which follows <HI>Comixan,</HI> containing about fifteen hundred Fami∣lies.</P>
<P>A little beyond <HI>Comixan</HI> lies the Dorp <HI>Mahiar:</HI> And lastly, between that and <HI>Hispahan,</HI> about a League from the latter, is a Village nam'd <HI>Ja∣rustan.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Persia</HI> is water'd by a large River, call'd <HI>Cur,</HI> which is a corrupt Name of <HI>Cyrus. Philip of Ferara</HI> in his <HI>Geography, Olearius,</HI> and others, will have this to be the same River which the <HI>Latins</HI> call'd <HI>Begradas:</HI> But <HI>Della Valle</HI> contradicts this Opinion, affirming, That <HI>Bendemir</HI> is the Name of a Bridge which lies cross the Ri∣ver, near the way coming from <HI>Ispahan</HI> to <HI>Schiras;</HI> but its right name is <HI>Curis,</HI> as is before mention'd; for <HI>Bend-Emir</HI> signifies <HI>The Bridge of Emir,</HI> because the <HI>Persians</HI> call a Bridge <HI>Bend,</HI> and <HI>Emir</HI> was the Name of the Builder.</P>
<P>The ancient Writers make mention of two Ri∣vers in <HI>Asia</HI> which bear the Name of <HI>Cyrus;</HI> the one whereof having washt <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Albania,</HI> discharges its Water into the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> and, as <HI>Olearius</HI> says, is at this day call'd <HI>Cur</HI> or <HI>Aras.</HI></P>
<P>The other, which we now speak of, glides from the North to the South through <HI>Persia,</HI> by the Walls of the City <HI>Schiras,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Gulph. From the Banks of this River the famous <HI>Cyrus</HI> was thrown in his Infancy, and gave his Name to the Place, and not to that where he was born, which was call'd <HI>Agradat.</HI></P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Persian Geographers,</HI> as <HI>Olearius, Garcias de Sylva, Figueroa,</HI> and others, judge the River <HI>Cur,</HI> or <HI>Bendemir,</HI> to be the same; with <HI>Araxes.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Araxes</HI> is the biggest of all those Rivers which water the Provinces of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Lara;</HI> not∣withstanding which, it is not very broad, but runs in a narrow Channel, in many Meanders, between high Mountains, being well replenish'd with all sorts of Fish.</P>
<P>This River takes its Original out of the Moun∣tain <HI>Jessel,</HI> lying between the famous Cities <HI>Suster</HI> and <HI>Margascan,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Susa</HI> and <HI>Persepolis;</HI> and first directingits Course Southward, bends
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>afterwards to the East, separating the ancient Province of <HI>Susiana</HI> from the Western part of <HI>Car∣mania,</HI> and so enters into the Kingdom of <HI>Persia;</HI> and after having receiv'd the Waters of many little Rivolets, and divided the Province of <HI>Ker∣man</HI> and the ancient <HI>Caramie Foelix,</HI> finding its Current to the Sea stopt by the exceeding high Mountains, it returns with great force to the North-East, being grown bigger than before, and much deeper, by the Waters which fall from the fore-mention'd Mountains; thence it again runs Southward, visiting the ancient <HI>Gedrosie,</HI> and at last falls into the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, making a spacious Bay.</P>
<P>Near the Ruins of <HI>Cehil Minar,</HI> and the ancient <HI>Persepolis,</HI> glides the River <HI>Pelevar,</HI> which takes its Course towards the South, and falls into the <HI>Cur,</HI> after having first water'd one of the fruitful∣est Parts of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Persia</HI> is very Mountainous in several Places; but they are not altogether sterill: for the Moun∣tains of <HI>Neriz</HI> have many Iron Mines; and some relate that many <HI>Smaragds</HI> are found in this Pro∣vince. About ten or twelve Leagues from <HI>Schi∣ras</HI> are several high Hills, full of Palm and Len∣tisk-Trees, where breed many Wild Hogs.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Schiras,</HI> which is common to all the other Provinces of this Kingdom, are very white, the Women generally beautiful, and the Men well-proportion'd.</P>
<P>There is also a great Trade driven in <HI>Schiras,</HI> occasion'd by the <HI>Caravans,</HI> which coming from <HI>Samarcand</HI> and <HI>Zagatay,</HI> pass through this Place with great Quantities of Silk, Musk, Rhubarb, and <HI>Turcoises;</HI> all which those of <HI>Chorazzan</HI> re∣ceive from the Merchants which come from <HI>Ca∣tay,</HI> or the Northern <HI>China.</HI> And by this means <HI>Schiras</HI> furnishes other Countries with Provisions, as Wooll, Copper, and many other things; be∣sides Distill'd Rose-water; for they make ano∣ther sort than we in <HI>Europe,</HI> by decocting the Ro∣ses. They also get abundance of Silk from the Silk-worms they breed here; and have likewise Rubies, <HI>Balayses</HI> (which come from the City <HI>Bala∣san,</HI>) and great store of <HI>Lazuus</HI> Stones, and <HI>Tutty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Persia</HI> or <HI>Fars</HI> is not very cold, though its Situ∣ation be more Northerly than the other Provin∣ces; for in <HI>December</HI> all the Gardens about <HI>Schiras</HI> are green, and the Trees retain their Leaves; be∣cause the Ground being moisten'd by so many Rivers, is not onely preserv'd from all extraordi∣nary Scorchings, but so cooled, and the Fruit be∣comes ripe so late, that it may be preserv'd all the Winter, and kept very good till <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Schiras,</HI> and the Plains be∣tween the Mountains and the River <HI>Pasa,</HI> is natu∣rally dry and barren.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Rexel,</HI> near the Sea-coast, yields very excellent Wheat, and also good store of Fruit: That Tract of Land which extends Southerly produces abundance of Dates; as also the Ground about the City <HI>Com:</HI> but no Vines. The Country of <HI>Tarom,</HI> with the other neigh∣boring Places, are all planted with Date-trees, under whose the Inhabitants sow Cotton. There is also abundance of Sweet-briar, out of whose Flowers the Inhabitants distill a sort of Water which they call <HI>Gulaep,</HI> that is, <HI>Rose-water.</HI></P>
<P>Out of the gaping Ciefts of a high Mountain in the Country <HI>Stahanon,</HI> distils a Liquor or Juyce which the King of <HI>Persia</HI> causes to be gather'd by Persons sworn for that purpose, which yearly take up thirty <HI>Meticals,</HI> or about forty or fifty Ounces of the said Distillation, which by the <HI>Persians</HI> is call'd <HI>Monmaky Cony,</HI> that is, <HI>Precious Water;</HI> and is kept onely for the King's Use: it being, as they affirm, an excellent Antidote against all Poyson, and an infallible Remedy against inward Bruises, as also outwardly apply'd for Sinew-strains, Con∣tusions, and the like. The King many times be∣stows some of it upon those Princes that are in League with him, as an extraordinary Mark of his Favor. In stead of this, the <HI>Turks</HI> use <HI>Terra Si∣gillata;</HI> the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> of the Eastern Countries, <HI>Pazar Cony,</HI> which is a kind of <HI>Jews-Gum,</HI> gather'd at <HI>Maxulpata,</HI> or <HI>Musulipatan,</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> but is not of that Vertue and Power as this of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Schiras</HI> the <HI>Persians</HI> find a sort of bitter Root, by the Apothecaries call'd <HI>Cost,</HI> from the example of the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> though they generally add the Word <HI>Talk</HI> to the same, <HI>viz. Cost-Talk,</HI> that is, <HI>Bitter Cost,</HI> to distinguish it from the common <HI>Indian Cost,</HI> which they call <HI>Cost Xerir,</HI> that is, <HI>Sweet Cost.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bitter Cost</HI> hath a Root very hard and firm, of a yellow Colour, somewhat inclining to white, if it be fresh and good; but if it be digg'd out of season, or carelesly dry'd, it becomes blue or brown: The Shell or Rind is streak'd, and the Pulp white, and bitterish: The old Roots are very unsavory and ill-tasted. It is brought into <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> either in round Pieces, or else in long Slices.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Lastan</HI> produces abundance of <HI>Ingo,</HI> by the Apothecaries call'd <HI>Assa foetida.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Fars</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> especially about <HI>Schiras,</HI> they have very excellent Wine, the best in all <HI>Persia,</HI> which they call <HI>Xarao</HI> or <HI>Charab;</HI> and it is sent to all Parts of the Country, especially to the Court; for the King and his Nobles drink no other: and if any Person of Quality entertains another, he al∣ways treats him with this Wine.</P>
<P>This Province also produces Bezoar-stones, which the <HI>Persians</HI> properly call <HI>Pazahar,</HI> which is a Compound Word of <HI>Pa</HI> and <HI>Zahar,</HI> the first signifying <HI>Against,</HI> and the other <HI>Poyson:</HI> They are chiefly found in a County call'd <HI>Stabanon,</HI> three days Journey from <HI>Lara;</HI> where also grows in the Fields a Plant like Saffron, which the Goats eating, causes the foremention'd Stones to grow in their Stomachs, and are esteem'd above all other Gems by the King of <HI>Persia:</HI> Nay, the Fields wherein the said Goats graze are constantly guarded, and the collecting of the Stones look'd after by Officers appointed particularly for that purpose.</P>
<P>There is also a Stone by the Physicians call'd <HI>Lapis Judaicus,</HI> that is, <HI>The Jews Stone;</HI> and by the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Arabians, Ager Alyud,</HI> that is, <HI>The Stone of Judas.</HI> There is likewise the <HI>Armenian Stone,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> and in the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Tongue nam'd <HI>Ager Armeni,</HI> that is, <HI>The Arme∣nian Stone.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst many other Beasts which breed in <HI>Persia,</HI> there is one peculiar to this Province, which the <HI>Persians</HI> call <HI>Castar,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards, Adives;</HI> and is perhaps the <HI>Hyena</HI> of the Ancients. They breed for the most part in the Hedges about <HI>Schi∣ras,</HI> and are, as <HI>Garcias de Sylva</HI> affirms, a kind of Dogs bred first in <HI>Barbary.</HI> They come in great companies out of the Hedges in the Night, to seek for Prey, making a hideous howling. They are naturally so subtile, that if they were not so
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>very greedy, they could not be taken. They tear up the Graves in the Fields, and devour the Dead Bodies; and often, when hungry, they ven∣ture into Houses, where if they find any thing, they call their Companions, by making a great noise; whereof the Inhabitants taking notice, surround and catch them.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Persia</HI> comprehends the an∣cient Kingdom or Dukedom of <HI>Lar,</HI> or <HI>Lara,</HI> with a Metropolis of the same; denomination; from whence the <HI>Laryns</HI> (a Coin so current in all the Eastern Countries) had their name, as we ob∣serv'd before.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Lara</HI> is by <HI>Figueroa</HI> accounted part of the old <HI>Carmanie,</HI> as <HI>Oëssa</HI> (commonly call'd the Kingdom of <HI>Monbareca</HI>) the other part; be∣sides the Countries of <HI>Mogosthan.</HI> This ancient Dukedom was formerly possess'd by a peculiar Prince, who Govern'd with an Arbitrary Power, and not subject to the Crown of <HI>Persia.</HI> The last Prince, according to <HI>Gaspar Bernardino,</HI> was call'd <HI>Abrahi Mochom;</HI> but by <HI>Della Valle, Ibrahim Chan;</HI> by <HI>Figueroa, Hambrain Chan;</HI> and by our Mr. <HI>Her∣bert, Erahim Cawn;</HI> an Atheistical and bloody∣minded Person. But <HI>Alvaredy Chan, Sultan</HI> of <HI>Schiras,</HI> invading him, <HI>Anno</HI> 1602. by the Com∣mand of <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> storm'd the City of <HI>Lar,</HI> and kill'd the King, besides all the Nobility and Gentry, to the number of five thousand; causing also the Castles to be pull'd down, and the Walls thrown to the Ground, leaving nothing standing that was of any Strength or Consequence. And in this manner the Kingdom of <HI>Lar</HI> was joyn'd to the Crown of <HI>Persia,</HI> and added to the Dominion of <HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Lar</HI> at <HI>Lara</HI> is a very ancient City, and of great note amongst the <HI>Arabians,</HI> being the Metropolis, as <HI>Figueroa</HI> supposes, of the old <HI>Car∣manie.</HI> It is situate in 27 Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude, at the end of a great Plain, so enclos'd with Mountains, that they leave onely a little Opening or Way, which leads to <HI>Schiras.</HI> When this City was first built, cannot certainly be resolv'd: Some ascribe the Age thereof to that of our first Forefathers; others say, it was founded not much above a thousand years ago.</P>
<P>The Walls of the Houses are made of Sun∣dry'd Bricks and Clay, and plaster'd over with a kind of Mortar made of chopt Straw and Earth, which the <HI>Persians</HI> use in all their Buildings, espe∣cially in the Provinces of <HI>Lara, Querman,</HI> and <HI>Per∣sia.</HI> Most of them are but one Story high, having few Windows, and those very small, and cover d with Lattices, or stopt with Mats.</P>
<P>In this City is an ancient Palace, formerly the Residence of the Prince, with a large Court be∣fore it; which had stood empty a considerable time, when the <HI>Chan</HI> of <HI>Schiras</HI> came to <HI>Lar</HI> to take possession thereof.</P>
<P>Here are likewise two other remarkable Pla∣ces: The one, a Castle or Fort; the other, the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Exchange. The first, being almost half a League in circumference, is built of Free-stone, on the West side of the City, on a little Hill, and fortified with thirty eight strong Bulwarks, which defend the City from any outward At∣tempts, and also Commands it.</P>
<P><HI>Figueroa</HI> affirms, That the Castle covers the whole top of the Mountain, which is Oval, and fortified with a Stone Wall, and a Breast-work, with divers Loop-holes for small Shot. It is ve∣ry large in circumference, and hath a Well with excellent Water, above two hundred Fathom deep; for it reaches quite down to the City: yet is the Water nevertheless very easily drawn up, with a Wheel turn'd by an Ox.</P>
<P>The other Place of note in this City, is the <HI>Bazar;</HI> that is, A Street full or Shops, like the Exchange. This <HI>Bazar</HI> was the Work of <HI>Alva∣redy Chan,</HI> the before-mention'd <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Schiras;</HI> and is without doubt one of the fairest and best in all <HI>Asia.</HI> It consists of an exact Square, en∣clos'd within high Walls of white Stone, each Square being 150 Paces, and in every one a large Gate, through which you enter into a fair Walk, that opens into four Rows of Shops, each twenty Foot broad, making a Cross-way; in the middle whereof is a very high Turret, full of large Win∣dows, built on four Arches of Stone, which ta∣king their beginning from thence, cover the four Walks: The Materials so neatly painted and po∣lish'd, that they out-vie Marble: The Ground is also very curiously pav'd. In four other Squares, but much less than the former, are four other small Cross-ways, which have also a Turret in the mid∣dle of each; from whence, as from the great one, run four other lesser Arched Walks of fifteen or sixteen Foot broad. Almost in the middle, un∣der the great Turret or Arch, is a Spring of Fresh Water, which is brought thither in Pipes from Places far distant, and convey'd from thence to all Parts of the City.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bazar</HI> are sold all manner of Merchan∣dises, as well in the Shops by the Inhabitants, as by Foreign Merchants, who stay here all day to vend their Goods, and return to their Lodgings in the Evening, when the <HI>Bazar</HI> is lock'd up, and guarded by a Company of Soldiers appointed for that purpose. In some of these Shops are sold both Green, Dry'd, and Preserv'd Fruit; as also In-land Bread, call'd <HI>Hapas</HI> or <HI>Curichas:</HI> But the Country-People which bring their Commodities to sell, have no peculiar Shops, but lay their Mer∣chandise on Stalls before the Shops, leaving a sufficient space between, for the People to pass.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Bazar</HI> is the Mint, where they Coin the <HI>Laryns</HI> before-mention'd.</P>
<P>There are few <HI>Mosques</HI> here; but amongst those which are, there is one built round, to represent <HI>Eternity,</HI> after the same manner with the <HI>Alcaba</HI> or Holy <HI>Mosque</HI> at <HI>Mecha,</HI> which <HI>Schach Abraham</HI> is said to have brought from Heaven. On some Places thereof are <HI>Arabian</HI> Letters, Cyphers, and short Sentences graven, after the <HI>Mosaick</HI> manner. It is a low Structure, having in stead of Windows onely Carv'd Ballisters. The Entrance into the same is through a Copper Gate, near which hangs a great Looking-glass. There are also many Lamps, some of which are kept continually burn∣ing, and others hang onely for Ornament. Some of the <HI>Persian</HI> Prophets lie here interr'd; and amongst others, one call'd <HI>Emir Ally Zedday Amir,</HI> who, if what they affirm upon Oath may be cre∣dited, hath been there above 1500 Years, <HI>viz.</HI> 600 Years before <HI>Mahomet;</HI> yet nevertheless, they stick not to affirm, that he was a good <HI>Muselman</HI> or <HI>Mahumetan.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Lar</HI> is the usual meeting-place of the <HI>Cara∣vans</HI> or <HI>Cafilas</HI> which travel from <HI>Persia, Querman,</HI> and other Places, to the Isle of <HI>Ormus;</HI> and come from thence, and <HI>Arabia,</HI> to these Provinces: Wherefore this City is much frequented by Mer∣chants,
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>as well <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> as <HI>Benjans</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> and to that purpose are built many <HI>Ca∣ravanseras,</HI> for the accommodation of strange Mer∣chants that come thither with their Commodities.</P>
<P>This City hath been much ruin'd by Earth∣quakes, one of which, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1400. threw down above a hundred Houses; and another, <HI>Anno</HI> 1593. above three hundred, or, as <HI>Texeira</HI> affirms, five hundred; at which time also many Water-Ce∣sterns, and the greatest part of the City Walls were spoil'd. The ancient Castle formerly built by a <HI>Georgian</HI> call'd <HI>Melek,</HI> on a Stone Rock on the East side of the City, was also cast down.</P>
<P>A League from <HI>Lar</HI> is a <HI>Caravansera</HI> call'd <HI>Char∣caph.</HI></P>
<P>The last Place in this Dukedom of <HI>Lar,</HI> at the entrance of the Country which belong'd to the King of <HI>Ormus,</HI> when he was absolute Master of his whole Kingdom on the Main Continent of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> is <HI>Abi Dunger.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Climate, we cannot say there is any great Cold at <HI>Lar,</HI> the Air being so tempe∣rate, that in <HI>March</HI> you can scarce get into the City, for the abundance of Flies and Gnats, which in great Swarms fill the Air. But in <HI>June</HI> there blows such a hot and dry Wind, that on all Pla∣ces over which it passes, it leaves Impressions as of Fire; and withal scorches the Faces, Hands, and Legs of Strangers, to their great trouble and pain; call'd therefore by the <HI>Persians Bad Semum,</HI> that is, <HI>An infectious and burning Wind.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Country of <HI>Lar</HI> is very destitute of Water; for there are neither Brooks, Springs, nor Wells; onely in several Places on the Road are plac'd Troughs, which catch the Rain-water, which serves for the accommodation and refresh∣ment of Travellers. Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> says, this Wa∣ter is very unwholesom, and occasions many Di∣stempers, as well in the Inhabitants as Strangers; <HI>viz.</HI> Rheums, Sore Throats, and Worms in the Legs, which causes Itching and Lameness, and is not to be cur'd without taking out the Worm; and this must also be done with great care; for if the Worm chance to break, it causes Putrefaction and Numbness in the Part affected, which is only to be remedied by continual cutting and slashing of the Flesh.</P>
<P>There is nothing worthy of praise in all the Country about <HI>Lar,</HI> but the Charitable Inclina∣tions of divers of the Inhabitants, who, besides the Cesterns which the ancient Kings of <HI>Lara</HI> and their Governors made, for the Publick good and Refreshment of the Inhabitants and Travellers which come daily hither, in their last Wills ap∣point certain Persons to build with their Estates Cesterns, <HI>Caravanseras,</HI> and Alms-houses; some great, and others little, according to their Capaci∣ties, and Zeal in their Religion: and by this means there are so many Cesterns, that the adja∣cent Plain is full of them; and the Water therein is very clear and cool in Summer, notwithstanding the great Heat.</P>
<P>About <HI>Lar</HI> and the Parts adjacent are several sorts of Fruit-trees, as Oranges, Lemmons, and the best Dates in all <HI>Persia.</HI> Most of the Inhabi∣tants live on Dates, partly by making them their Food, and partly by selling and bartering them for other Necessaries.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Lar</HI> and <HI>Gamron</HI> grows abundance of <HI>Assa Foetida,</HI> by the <HI>Maleyans</HI> and <HI>Javanners</HI> call'd <HI>Hin.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were <HI>Arabians,</HI> of which there are yet many living.</P>

<P><HI>Magin</HI> supposes <HI>Xyruan</HI> to comprehend all <HI>Me∣dia,</HI> though it be onely a part, as <HI>Minadoi▪ Leun∣clavius, Olearius,</HI> and others have observ'd, who take it onely for old <HI>Media,</HI> or <HI>Atropatia.</HI> Our Mr. <HI>Jenkinson</HI> will have the same; to be <HI>Hircania.</HI> But <HI>Schirwan</HI> is rather the Northern <HI>Media,</HI> as ap∣pears by the nature of the Soil; for (accordtng to <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI>) that part of <HI>Media</HI> is moun∣tainous, as the Countrey now call'd <HI>Schirwan</HI> is found to be.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bounds.</NOTE>This Province conterminates in the East, with the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea; on the West, with <HI>Georgia;</HI> on the North, with <HI>Albany,</HI> and somewhat higher with the wandring <HI>Tartars,</HI> which inhabit be∣tween Mount <HI>Caucasus</HI> and the River <HI>Volga;</HI> and in the South it juts out against <HI>Great Armenia,</HI> where the River <HI>Canack</HI> running betwixt, serves for a Boundary, and thence passes on till at last it comes to limit <HI>Great Media.</HI> Its whole length is accounted about a hundred Miles.</P>
<P>The Metropolis of this Province of <HI>Schirwan</HI> is by divers Writers differently nam'd; by <HI>Bizar∣ro</HI> and <HI>Barbaro, Sumachia;</HI> by others, <HI>Samachia;</HI> and by the <HI>Spaniards, Namachi;</HI> but the com∣mon Name is <HI>Schamachie,</HI> of which Namet here is but one City in <HI>Media</HI> or <HI>Persia;</HI> notwithstand∣ing <HI>Ferrarius</HI> in his short <HI>Geography</HI> makes men∣tion of two, one anciently call'd <HI>Ciropolis,</HI> and the other <HI>Samunis.</HI> It lies in 84 Degrees and 30 Minutes Longitude, and 40 Degrees and 50 Mi∣nutes Latitude, about six days Journey from the City <HI>Derbend,</HI> or <HI>Demircapi,</HI> by reason of the turn∣ings and by-ways which you must travel through the Mountains; but it is not above two days Journey along the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, through <HI>Bacuy</HI> and the Mountains of <HI>Lahats,</HI> and very passable either on Foot or on Horseback. The Cammels com∣monly go the first Way, finishing the Journey according as they are laden. It is situate in a Val∣ley betwixt Mountains, which prevent its being seen till you come just upon it. The Castle thereto belonging stands on a Hill near the City Walls, which together with the City, was built (as the <HI>Persians</HI> affirm) by King <HI>Schirwan Sehach.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of the City <HI>Scha∣machie.</HI></NOTE>This City formerly was much bigger in cir∣cumference than at this day, having been much ruin'd in King <HI>Abbas</HI>'s time by the <HI>Turkish</HI> Wars: It was anciently divided into two parts, each be∣ing severally inclos'd with a Wall; but the fore∣mention'd King seeing that the <HI>Turks</HI> aim'd at no∣thing but strong and well fortifi'd Places, for the better maintaining of their Conquest, and never medled with open Villages; also observing that the Forts lying in the middle of the Coun∣trey and not on his Borders, did him more hurt than good, he caus'd the Walls of the Southern part of the City to be pull'd down, and likewise those that inclos'd the Cities <HI>Tauris</HI> or <HI>Tabris, Nachtzuan,</HI> and <HI>Kentze.</HI></P>
<P>This South part of <HI>Schamachie</HI> lies like a pecu∣liar Town, separated from the Northern by a little Hill, which serves as a publick Market-place to both.</P>
<P>It is said, that when the <HI>Turk</HI> conquer'd this City, and went about afterwards to fortifie it, he demolish'd the <HI>Persian</HI> Tombs, to repair the City Walls with the Material thereof.</P>
<P>The North part of the City lies at the foot of another Hill, and being somewhat less than the foremention'd South part, is surrounded with a sleight Stone Wall, so ruin'd, that though the Gates, which are five in number, belock'd, you may get into the City at any time of the Night over the Walls.</P>
<P>The Streets in both Towns are narrow, and the Houses, built of Stone or Earth, are very low, after the Eastern manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Cara∣vansera's</HI> or Royal Inns.</NOTE>Hard by the Market-place stand two great <HI>Caravansera's,</HI> or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Built at the Kings Charge.</NOTE> Royal Inns, provided with many Galleries and large Rooms, in which the Merchants of other Countreys dispose of their Commodities which they sell by whole-sale. The one call'd <HI>Schach Caravansera,</HI> is appointed for the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who lay up their Goods in the same. The other, nam'd <HI>Losgi Caravansera,</HI> is built for the <HI>Circassian Tartars,</HI> who also bring thither their Merchandise, which for the most part consists in Horses, Women, young and full grown Maids, and sometimes little Chil∣dren, which they either buy, or take from the <HI>Russians</HI> on their Borders, or else from one ano∣ther. Moreover, the <HI>Jews</HI> have their Residences in the <HI>Caravansera Losgi,</HI> bringing very fine Wooll thither from <HI>Tabessaran.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Hamans</HI> or publick Baths.</NOTE>There are likewise three publick <HI>Hamans,</HI> or Baths, in the City, which are very much fre∣quented by the <HI>Persians;</HI> two of them stand open in the day-time for the Men, and in the Night for the Women. The third, call'd <HI>Ham∣mam Schech,</HI> being onely for Men, near which stand two large Trees, which are held in great veneration by the <HI>Persians,</HI> as having been planted there by one of their Saints, call'd <HI>Schich Murith,</HI> who not far from thence lies bury'd in a <HI>Metzit,</HI> or Temple, to which the People flock more than to any other in the City, which contains in all six <HI>Metzits,</HI> or Temples. The Revenues which the Baths produce yearly, are bestow'd on those things which go to the set∣ting forth of their Funerals, and what happens to be over and above, is distributed amongst the Poor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market-place.</NOTE>On the South side of the City is a <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market-place, with several little Streets, or rows of Shops, furnish'd with all sorts of Cotton, Stuffs, Silk, Cloth-of-Silver, Bowes, Arrows, Simiters, and other Manufactures, which are all to be bought at easie Rates.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are generally <HI>Persians, Arme∣nians,</HI> and <HI>Georgians,</HI> speaking each their pecu∣liar Languages besides the vulgar Tongue of <HI>Scervan,</HI> which is the <HI>Turkish.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing remarkable, or of An∣tiquity in this City, excepting the great Tower, which Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> affirms to be built of Free-stone and Flint, intermixt with the Sculls of their ancient Noblemen, who being overcome
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>and taken Prisoners in a War against the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> were put to death, and had their Heads so fixt for a signal Mark of terror, to prevent fu∣ture Insurrections: But this Assertion is by some deny'd, and judg'd to have been grounded upon the appearance onely of Heads carv'd there in Stone.</P>
<P>Half a League Northward from the City, on a pretty high Hill call'd <HI>Caleculistan,</HI> appear the Ruines of a decay'd Fort, where there is a large Cave, Vaulted with Free-stone, and near it a deep Well.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Culistan,</HI> whence deno∣minated.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> have a Tradition, that <HI>Schirvan,</HI> an ancient King of this Province, caus'd this Ca∣stle to be built in memory of <HI>Culistan,</HI> one of his Concubines, from whom it also took Denomina∣tion. They add moreover, that it was taken by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and afterwards by him de∣molish'd. But it is more probable, that it receiv'd the Name of <HI>Culistan</HI> from an adjacent Valley, made very fruitful by a Brook, and exceeding pleasant in the Spring, from the variety of Tu∣lips, and other diverse colour'd Flowers, <HI>Culistan</HI> signifying a Valley of Roses, Tulips, or whatever sort of curious Flowers, and <HI>Cale</HI> a Castle, or Fort.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Cale-Culistan</HI> towards the side of <HI>Schamachie,</HI> stand two Chappels on another high Hill: In the first and chiefest, which is built in form of an oblong Square, appears a high Sepul∣chre Rail'd about, each Bar arm'd at the top with an Iron Spike, and adorn'd with Tassels, or small Pennons of divers colour'd Cloth. In the other Chappel are other Tombs, bedeck'd after the same manner, being the Sepulchres of their Saints, to whom the <HI>Persians</HI> often kneel, and pay their usual Devotions. This last Chappel leads to a deep Vault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amaleck Can∣na'<HI>s Tomb.</HI></NOTE> in which (they say) <HI>Amaleck Canna,</HI> one of their King's Daughters lies bury'd, who being forc'd by her Father, contrary to her Inclination, to Marry a <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince, slew her self; and some have reported, that all Virgins thereabouts come yearly to the foremention'd Burying-place of <HI>Amaleck Canna,</HI> to Mourn there over her Tomb. 'Tis true indeed, the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Schamachie,</HI> and those also of the neigh∣boring Villages, in some Weeks in the Summer, do repair to the foremention'd Mountain, not for <HI>Amaleck Canna</HI>'s sake, as some imagine, but rather for the coolness of the Air which at that Season they find upon the tops of those Hills, when at the same; time it is intolerabe hot below: Some Artificers, and those of the meaner sort that use Manufacture, go thither in the Morning, and having tarry'd there all day at their Work, re∣turn to their Houses in the Evening; but the Nobility commonly take up their Residences there for three Moneths together, during which time the Heat continues. The Cattel at that time also are driven to Mount <HI>Elburs,</HI> where there is not onely a temperate Air, but also good Pa∣sturage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elburs</HI> is part of Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> bordering on the side of <HI>Tabesseran</HI> and <HI>Georgia,</HI> and may plainly be seen from <HI>Culistan</HI> and other Moun∣tains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wor∣shippers of <HI>Orimasda</HI> fled to <HI>India.</HI></NOTE>It is said, that in ancient times the <HI>Persians</HI> preserv'd and worshipp'd their <HI>Orimasda,</HI> or ever∣burning Fire, on this <HI>Elburs;</HI> but at this day neither the Fire nor the Worshippers thereof, are (according to <HI>Texeira</HI> and others) to be found in all <HI>Persia</HI> nor <HI>Jesche;</HI> but some relate that they are fled from thence to <HI>India,</HI> where they affirm is at this day a sort of Fire-Worshippers.</P>
<P>At <HI>Schamachie</HI> is yet to be seen a Cross of hard black Wood, which some believe was a piece of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ark.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Village <HI>Mordow.</HI></NOTE>To this City belongs a Village call'd <HI>Mordow,</HI> which in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language signifies <HI>Morass,</HI> because the Countrey about it is Fenny, and all drown'd with abundance of Water, which de∣scending with the concourse of many Brooks and Rivulets, falls with such violence, that the distur∣bed Waters never freeze in the hardest Winter.</P>
<P>The Rusticks live here like the <HI>Tartars</HI> in <HI>Astracan,</HI> in little Houses like Huts.</P>
<P>In the foremention'd Village, and in others thereabouts, dwell a People call'd <HI>Pedar,</HI> which speak a peculiar Dialect, though not much differ∣ing from the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> and are of their Religion, with some different Perswasions: for they account it a great Crime to eat their Meat hot, holding it as an Abomination that any should breathe upon it, which if any one chance to do, they will not touch it, but judge the same to be defil'd by their prophane Breath.</P>
<P>Three Leagues from <HI>Mordow</HI> lies the Village <HI>Tachousie;</HI> and three Leagues from <HI>Schamachie</HI> lies <HI>Pyrmaraas,</HI> in which is the Tomb of an eminent Saint, or Holy Man of <HI>Persia,</HI> call'd <HI>Heid Ibrahim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heid Ibrahims <HI>Tomb.</HI></NOTE> held in great veneration amongst the <HI>Persians,</HI> as a very ancient Monument, and left undemolish'd by <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> who destroy'd all things else here∣abouts: It is, Chappel-like, inclos'd with a Stone Wall, having before the access to it, two fair Courts; in the first whereof appear many Tomb-stones, whereon are Engraven in <HI>Arabick</HI> several Inscriptions; under it are also divers Vaults, which receive a glittering Light through little low Windows: In one of the deepest Vaults stands a high Stone Altar with two Steps; on the one side a Door leads into a Penetrale, or Withdrawing-Room, the Floor whereof is co∣ver'd with rich Tapestry; at the upper end hangs a Table of Stone, with this Inscription in <HI>Arabick, To God I commit my Actions, he is my Helper.</HI> On the right-hand is another Vault, which contains eight Chappels, or sepulchral Monuments; and from that you enter into a third, wherein stands the Tomb of the Prophet himself; round about which are plac'd great Candlesticks with Wax Tapers, which are kept continually burning; and from the Roof hang also Lamps. So choice are the <HI>Persians</HI> of this Tomb, that they do not willingly admit any Strangers to see it.</P>
<P>Near the Village <HI>Pyrmaraas</HI> stands another ce∣lebrated Monument in a Rocky Mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tirihabba</HI>'s Tomb.</NOTE> in which lies bury'd a Saint call'd <HI>Tirihabba,</HI> the Master or Instructer of <HI>Heid Ibrahim;</HI> over the Door of it stands written, <HI>O God, open this Door.</HI> This <HI>Tirihabba</HI> (as the <HI>Persians</HI> say) was always on his Knees incessantly praying, clad in a grey Coat, upon which his Disciple <HI>Heid Ibrahim</HI> ob∣tain'd from God, that his Tutor after his De∣cease, as well as in his Life-time, might be found in a zealous and praying Posture; whereupon it is reported, that after his Death he continu'd in that Posture, as if he had been living; with other such like Stories, not over easily to be credited. Round about <HI>Tirihabba</HI>'s Tomb are divers Caves cut in the same; Rock, furnish'd with Beds, where the Pilgrims Lodge when they come to make their Offerings.</P>

<P>By the said Village, next to <HI>Ibrahim</HI>'s Tomb; is a Cavern seventy two Foot long, and twenty broad, Vaulted with square Stones, in which the Inhabitants preserve Snow, Ice, and Water, in the Winter against the Summer, for themselves and their Cattel, because there is little good Wa∣ter else thereabouts.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Situati∣on of the Ci∣ty <HI>Derbend.</HI></NOTE>The City <HI>Derbend,</HI> by the <HI>Turks</HI> call'd <HI>Demir∣capi,</HI> or rather <HI>Temircapi,</HI> that is <HI>Iron Gate,</HI> lies West of the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, in 85 Degrees Longi∣tude, and 41 Degrees and 30 Minutes Northern Latitude, according to <HI>Olearius</HI>'s observation: It extends in length from East to West, half a League; and hath in breadth from North to South, and from one Gate to the other, onely four hundred and fifty Paces: The Waves of the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, upon which it stands, beating against the Walls, blocks up the Passage on that side, which, together with the inaccessible Moun∣tains on the other side, gives it the foremention'd Name of <HI>Temircapi,</HI> or <HI>Iron Gate to the Kingdom of Persia,</HI> it reaches on one end to the foot of the Mountains, on the other to the Sea.</P>
<P>Not onely several Writers, but also the In∣habitants to this day affirm, that this City was built by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, (whom they call'd <HI>Iscander</HI>) as a Retreat or place of repose for his Ar∣my, and from his own Name call'd <HI>Alexandria,</HI> whereas in truth he onely erected the Castle and Wall on the South side; but that on the North side was built by <HI>Nawschirwan,</HI> an ancient King of that Countrey: The Walls are high and broad, built of that sort of Stone before mention'd, which seems commix'd with broken Mussle∣shells: Over one of the Gates of the Wall which was built by <HI>Alexander,</HI> are certain Lines written in <HI>Syriack</HI> Characters, and in another place <HI>Ara∣bick,</HI> with some strange Hieroglyphicks, worn out by Time, and not legible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dee Descri∣ption of the City.</NOTE>This City is divided into three parts, the up∣permost stands upon an acclivity of the Moun∣tain, being the Residence of the Governor, forti∣fi'd with Guns, and Garrison'd with five hundred Soldiers of two several Nations, <HI>viz. Ajurumlu</HI> and <HI>Coidurscha.</HI> The middle part inhabited by <HI>Persians,</HI> hath been several times ruin'd; once by their own King <HI>Emir Emse, Chodabende</HI>'s Son, when he re-took the City from the <HI>Turkish</HI> Em∣peror <HI>Mustafa,</HI> to whom the Townsmen had free∣ly surrendred it. The lower part, being not five hundred Paces long, hath at this day very few Houses left standing, being now nothing but a parcel of Gardens, Orchards, and Plough'd-Lands. It is said, that this part was formerly in∣habited by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> wherefore it is to this day by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Schaher</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Junan</HI> pro∣bably from <HI>Iones.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Junan,</HI> that is, <HI>The Greeks City:</HI> Both the Walls are founded on Rocks. The Shore also about <HI>Derbend</HI> being all very Rocky, is altogether unfit for Anchorage, and unsafe Harbor for Shipping.</P>
<P>On the Mountains, which are very wooddy, above the City, appear the Ruines of a Wall, which (as they say) extended fifty Leagues along the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea: it appears by some parts of it yet remaining of six Foot high, to have been of equal breadth with the present Walls of the City, which are so broad, that a Coach may drive upon them. Moreover, on the upper side of the City stand several Castles apart on several Hills, whereof two, the nearest to the Town, being built square, are kept in indifferent good Repair, and well Garrison'd. There are also divers woodden Watch-houses, from whence they have a clear and large Prospect, and can timely see the approach of any Enemy, there being conti∣nual Watch kept in them.</P>
<P>Amongst other Remarks near the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tzumtzume</HI>'s Tomb.</NOTE> is the Tomb of <HI>Tzumtzume,</HI> of whom the <HI>Persians</HI> relate this following Story:</P>
<P><Q><HI>Eissi,</HI> a great Prophet amongst the <HI>Persians,</HI> passing by there on a certain time, and finding a Man's Scull lying on the Ground, desirous to know whose Scull it was, pray'd to God to make it again a living Person; whereupon he became immediately so inspir'd, that he brea∣thed the Breath of Life into it; and asking who he was? he reply'd, <HI>Tzumtzume, once a wealthy King of this Countrey, who possess'd a great City, abounding with all things; That he had spent daily forty Cammels load of Salt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A certain number for an uncertain.</NOTE> <HI>had forty thousand Head of Kine, forty thousand Stage-players, forty thousand Servants, who wore Pearls in their Ears, and as many more inferior Servants.</HI> Then said <HI>Tzumtzume</HI> to <HI>Eissi, Who are you? and what is your Religion?</HI> To which the Prophet an∣swer'd, <HI>I am</HI> Eissi, <HI>who teach the true Belief. Tzum∣tzume</HI> reply'd hereupon, <HI>Then I will embrace your Belief.</HI> After which he begg'd of <HI>Eisi,</HI> that he would permit him to die again; for he ra∣ther chose to die, than to be depriv'd of that happy Life he formerly enjoy'd: Whereupon his Request was granted by <HI>Eissi,</HI> and <HI>Tzum∣zume</HI> suffer'd to return a lifeless Carcase to his Grave.</Q></P>
<P>Near the same; Tomb stands an old Tree, on a Bank rais'd in form of a Stage, inclos'd within a Wall four Yards high and seven in the square, to which rhere is an Ascent by several Degrees or Steps.</P>
<P>One side of <HI>Derbend</HI> is noted for Tomb-stones and Monuments, amounting to several thou∣sands, most of them three Foot broad, and on the top of them <HI>Arabick</HI> and <HI>Syriack</HI> Characters Engraven.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> relate the following Story of the foremention'd Tomb <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That not many Ages after after <HI>Mahomet,</HI> a King "call'd <HI>Cassan</HI> Reign'd in <HI>Media,</HI> who in a Battel against the <HI>Tagestan Tartars,</HI> whom the <HI>Persians</HI> call <HI>Lesgi,</HI> losing many thousands of his Men, caus'd the chiefest of his Officers to be bury'd in the fore∣mention'd place, with Tomb-stones and Inscri∣ptions to perpetuate their Memory.</Q></P>
<P>There is yet another peculiar <HI>Coemeterie,</HI> or Burying-place, towards the Sea, surrounded with a Wall, within which are to be seen four of the foremention'd kind of Tomb stones together, by
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Tziltenan,</HI> and by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars, Kerchler.</HI> They say also, that forty Prin∣ces, all devout Men, who dy'd in the aforesaid Fight, lay bury'd there: Wherefore the <HI>Persians,</HI> both Men and Women; come daily to kiss the Tomb-stones, and laying their Hands upon them, Pray very devoutly.</P>
<P>In the City <HI>Derbend</HI> dwell no <HI>Christians,</HI> but onely <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Ben∣jamin.</HI></P>
<P>There is no considerable Trade driven here, ex∣cept that the <HI>Tartars</HI> bring their stoln Children, as also full grown <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Russians,</HI> to sell, which afterwards are sent farther into <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tombs of <HI>Pyrhr Mu∣cur,</HI> and <HI>Imam Chur∣chud.</HI></NOTE>A quarter of a League from the City, where the Borders of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Tagestan</HI> are separated by a small Brook, are two Sepulchres of <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Prophets: The first being that of <HI>Pyrhr Muchar,</HI> stands in a Plain; and the other of <HI>Imam Curchud,</HI> in the Mountains, of whom the Tradition goes, that he was ally'd to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and that being al∣ways with him, he was instructed by him, and liv'd three hundred years after him. Moreover, that going to the King of <HI>Cassan,</HI> he so prevail'd with him by playing on a Musical Instrument, and Singing, that he drew him to side with the <HI>Lesgi,</HI> or <HI>Tagestan Tartars:</HI> But when he under∣took to Convert the <HI>Lesgi,</HI> who were <HI>Heathens,</HI> and began to Preach amongst them, they con∣spir'd against him and murder'd him: His Grave is in a great Cavity, cut in a Rocky Mountain, the Coffin being onely four Planks nail'd toge∣ther without any Ornaments, and to be seen by all People, onely with the leave of an old Wo∣man, who sits continually by to watch it. But when they come hither to make Offerings, they cover the Floor with Straw Mats, and hang Ta∣pestry before the Cavity in which the Coffin stands. Women and Maids repair thither in great numbers from the City, and other remote places, and go bare-footed into the Sepulchre, kiss the Chest, and kneel down to Pray by it; which done, they make their Offerings to the old Woman, who is reverenc'd as a holy Person, and keeps a Lamp burning all Night long in the Tomb. Their Offerings consist in Cheese, But∣ter, Milk, Bread, Money, Wax, and the like.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Ba∣chu.</HI></NOTE>Another City call'd <HI>Bachu,</HI> or as others write, <HI>Bacuse,</HI> lies also near the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and is a safe Harbor for Ships, insomuch that some Writers have given this Sea the Name of <HI>Mare de Bacu,</HI> or, <HI>The Sea of Bacu.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moun∣tain <HI>Barmach.</HI></NOTE>Three Leagues from the Village <HI>Tachousi</HI> lies the Mountain <HI>Barmach,</HI> which appearing at a great distance is round, and hath a very high steep Rock on the top, which in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language they call <HI>Barmach</HI> that is, <HI>A Finger,</HI> because it reaches above other Mountains like a pointing Finger. From the Valley there leads a Way up to the same, which is dangerous to be ascended by those that are unacquainted with it.</P>
<P>On the top of this Mountain the Air is so cold, that the Grass and Herbs are as it were candy'd or crisp'd over with Ice, when yet it is very plea∣sant and warm Weather below: The broken Walls and other pieces of Ruine, sufficiently te∣stifie, that it was anciently crown'd with a strong Castle, and is said to have been built by <HI>Alexan∣der,</HI> and ruin'd by <HI>Tamerlane;</HI> for at the foot of the high Rock is a Plain of fifty Rods square, about which are to be discern'd the Foundations of an ancient thick Wall with Bulwarks: In the middle thereof is a deep Well wall'd about, and not far from thence two Tombs cover'd with great round Stones. On the North side also, and at the going up to the Rock, stands a great piece of a Wall, and heaps of Stone, which without doubt are the Ruines of another Castle; from whence several Steps lead to the top of the Rock, where there is another Arch, which serves for a third resting place. Near the old Wall on the Stone Rocks, grow Fig-trees in several places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trade of this Province</NOTE>The Inhabitants of this Countrey drive a great Trade in Silk, especially in the City <HI>Ser∣wan,</HI> where it is sold in such abundance, that it is Transported from thence through all <HI>Muscovy</HI> and the East Countrey. The City <HI>Eres</HI> also was formerly famous for the abundance of white Silk, which the Merchants call'd <HI>Mammodees;</HI> but through the long Wars, and destruction of <HI>Ser∣wan,</HI> both Staples, formerly so famous, are now fail'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Military Strength.</NOTE>The Military Strength of this Province of <HI>Schirwan</HI> herein chiefly appears, that the City <HI>Schamachie</HI> alone is able in time of need to set forth eighteen thousand Horse. The natural For∣tifications are also no less considerable, the chief whereof is that foremention'd Pass call'd <HI>The Iron Gate,</HI> being one of the strongest Bulwarks in the whole Province, securing the Way against the <HI>Albains, Russians, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Change of Government.</NOTE>The ancient Kings of this Province, with their several Dynasties and Revolutions, are suffici∣ently known in History; but the last of the na∣tive <HI>Median</HI> Kings was <HI>Aydar,</HI> who was slain by <HI>Farrock Yacar,</HI> whose Son <HI>Xa Ismael Sophi</HI> reduc'd the Kingdom to a Province, since which time it hath been Govern'd by his <HI>Chans</HI> or Lieutenants.</P>
<P>There belong to the Province of <HI>Schirwan</HI> the Territory call'd <HI>Muscur</HI> extending along the <HI>Cas∣pian</HI> Sea from <HI>Derbend</HI> to <HI>Kilcan,</HI> comprising two hundred Villages.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Coun∣trey of <HI>Mus∣cur.</HI></NOTE>This Countrey of <HI>Muscur</HI> is every where very pleasant to the Eye, affording a green Prospect till <HI>November.</HI> The Soil is fertile, producing plenty of Barley, Rice, and Wheat, besides all manner of excellent Fruit, and Trees of delight∣ful shade, and harbor to melodious Birds. The Cattel lie abroad in the Fields as well in Winter as in Summer, so that they have little need of providing Hay, more than what just serves for Travellers and Strangers. The Vines grow up and down without Planting, and run upon the Elms, or such like Trees, as in <HI>Italy.</HI> There is likewise variety of wild Fowl here, especially Pheasants; also store of Hares, and a sort of Foxes, call'd by the Inhabitants <HI>Schacal,</HI> having thick Wooll on their Backs, white Hair under their Bellies, black Ears, and a less Tail than or∣dinary, which they call <HI>Tulki.</HI> In the Lakes and Pools about the Village <HI>Mardow</HI> are abundance of wild Swans, which are commonly taken in the Winter, much esteem'd for the fineness of their Down. The Rusticks keep Buffalo's, which are us'd in their Draughts; their Fodder is <HI>Schenbile,</HI> or <HI>Grecian</HI> Hay, with which whole Fields are Sow'd; it is Mow'd when green, and given Seed and all to the Buffalo's, which makes their Milk so rich, that it yields Cream two Inches thick, of which is made excellent Butter.

<P>This Province of <HI>Erack</HI> borders Eastward at <HI>Arie,</HI> and by a long Road at <HI>Corazan;</HI> on the West it conterminates with <HI>Media;</HI> on the North, with <HI>Hircania;</HI> and juts Southerly towards the Wilderness of <HI>Caramia.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Bounds of the City <HI>Ispahan.</HI></NOTE>This City, lying in 32 Degrees and 26 Mi∣nutes, North Latitude, and 86 Degrees and 40 Minutes Longitude, is situated upon a Plain, and half environ'd with Mountains at three or four Leagues distance, <HI>viz.</HI> towards the South and South-West, with the Mountains <HI>Demawend;</HI> and towards the North-East, those of <HI>Jeilack Perjan:</HI> It is eight Leagues in circumference, with its Suburbs; but it is fenc'd onely with a a slight Wall of Earth, six Yards thick at the bot∣tom, and not above a Foot on the top, with seve∣ral Stone Redoubts: The Moat about the same is almost quite dry, insomuch that one may go over it dry-foot in several places both in Winter and Summer. The Castle, which is also the Treasury, is built pretty strong, and Plaister'd over with Lime. On the South-West side of the Town runs an indifferent large Stream, call'd <HI>Senderuth,</HI> which springing out of the Mountain <HI>Demawend,</HI> divides it self into two several Bran∣ches, call'd <HI>Haws</HI> and <HI>Burke.</HI> Besides which, there are divers Wells and Springs up and down, so that the whole City is very well serv'd with Water. Out of the same River runs a third Branch just above the City, into a Park of Deer, call'd <HI>Hazartzirib;</HI> and in another place it is con∣vey'd in Pipes under Ground, into the King's chief Garden, call'd <HI>Tzarbag,</HI> a little below which <HI>Al∣lawerdich, Chan</HI> of <HI>Schiras,</HI> built a fair Stone Bridge cross the Stream. <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> during his fourteen years Reign, made it his principal Business to lead another Stream (which passes on the other side of the Mountain <HI>Demawend</HI>) through the said Mountain, though in a manner all Rock, into the River <HI>Senderuth,</HI> employing daily a thou∣sand Men about it, allowing each man four <HI>Abas</HI> a day; but by reason of the excessive Cold, and abundance of Snow which falls thereabouts, they were never able to work above three Moneths in a year, which very much retarded the Work; yet through the alacraty of the Nobles and Gran∣dees in assisting the King, it was brought to a great forwardness, and had been quickly finish'd, had <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> liv'd, but after his Death his Successor never employ'd a Man about it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of the City.</NOTE>This City was also twice laid waste by <HI>Ta∣merlane,</HI> first when he conquer'd it, and next when it rebell'd against him: In <HI>Schach Ismael</HI>'s time it began to flourish a little, but when <HI>Scach Abbas,</HI> by reason of its pleasant Situation remov'd his Royal Seat from <HI>Casvyn</HI> thither, he not onely en∣larg'd and beautifi'd the City with fair Buildings, but also made it very populous, by reason of the great concourse of People that flockt thither from all parts, insomuch that at this day the Inhabi∣tants thereof are estimated to be above five hun∣dred thousand. Every House of the City (which much enlarges it) hath two fair Gardens, being generally much esteem'd by the <HI>Persians,</HI> who though they beautifie them not so much with all manner of various colour'd Flowers, as is usual in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet they Plant them very handsomly with divers sorts of Fruit-trees, Vines, and especi∣ally the <HI>Tzinar</HI> Tree; besides which, they adorn them with pleasant Fountains, and conveying the Water from one Pipe to another, cause them at their pleasure to overflow the whole Garden. Persons of Quality have also commonly two or three Pleasure-houses in every Garden, which are better furnish'd than their Dwelling-houses. Be∣sides the Citizens ordinary Habitations, there are several Palaces in the City, which are not so beautiful without as within; they are for the most part built of Sun-dry'd Brick and square Tile, and after the <HI>Persian</HI> manner, many two, some three, and others four Stories high, each having a pecu∣liar Name; the Cellar they call <HI>Sirsemin;</HI> the lower Story, or Hall, <HI>Chane;</HI> the Rooms or Chambers above it, <HI>Cush;</HI> the third Story, <HI>Tzaufe;</HI> the fourth, <HI>Casser;</HI> and the upper Chambers or Garrets, being built like Galleries, winding about the top of the House, <HI>Eiwan,</HI> which by rea∣son of their coolness serve them for Sleeping-Rooms in Summer: the Windows, which are almost as big as their Doors, and reach down quite to the Floor, have no Glass, but are onely Bars or Rails like Balconies, which in the Winter they close up with Oyl'd Paper: Their Winter Rooms are commonly below, and have Stoves in them: Most of the Houses have Courts, through which they go into their several Apartments. It is said, that the Lanes and Streets were formerly so broad, that above twenty Men could Ride abreast in them; but since <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> built more Rows of Houses, most of them are become
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>so narrow, that two can scarce pass one by ano∣ther, especially not far from the <HI>Maidan</HI> and <HI>Basar,</HI> where there commonly walk many People, who are forc'd when Mules come loaden, which fre∣quently happens, twenty or thirty one after ano∣ther, to stand still t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll they are all pass'd by.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the <HI>Mai∣dan</HI> or Mar∣ket-place.</NOTE>On the East side of the King's Palace is a <HI>Mai∣dan</HI> or Market-place, of seven hundred Paces long, and two hundred and fifty broad; the like whereof is not in any other City. On the West side, where the King's Court stands, are two Arches built along the <HI>Maidan,</HI> one against ano∣ther, under which Goldsmiths, Jewellers, and other Handicrafts, drive a Trade in <HI>Eiwans,</HI> or open Shops; before which stand Trees, by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Schin-schad,</HI> which with their large Boughs shade the Shops; before the Trees are long Troughs or Gutters of Stone, by which fresh Water is convey'd all about the <HI>Maidan.</HI> The East side, which is opposite to it, hath a broad Walk Arch'd and supported with Pillars; under which also all manner of Artificers have their Working-places; for the <HI>Persians</HI> seldom or ne∣ver work in their Dwelling-houses. Aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nst this Walk, near the King's Court, is a Structure, which having two Entries, is call'd <HI>Nacarachane,</HI> where the Kettle-Drums, Sackbuts, and Cornets, are play'd on every Evening at Sun-set, and when∣ever the King passeth either in or out. This play∣ing at Sun-set, us'd through all <HI>Persia</HI> in those places where <HI>Chams</HI> and great Lords dwell, hath been in use ever since <HI>Tamerlane</HI> was Lord of this Countrey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the King's Place,</NOTE>The King's House or Court, which is near the <HI>Maidan,</HI> by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Dowbet Chane,</HI> or <HI>Dor Chane Schach,</HI> hath a high Wall about it, but is not otherwise fortifi'd against any Assault: Be∣fore the Palace Gate lie several great pieces of Ordnance, which <HI>Nicholas Hemming,</HI> a <HI>Hollan∣der,</HI> who travell'd through most parts of <HI>Persia,</HI> affirms to have been brought from <HI>Ormus,</HI> the least carrying a Bullet of thirty six Pound weight, the biggest, of forty eight: Over the Gate is a large <HI>Forum,</HI> or place of Judicature, where the <HI>Diwanbeki,</HI> or Judge, commonly Exe∣cutes Justice: In the day-time the Gate is guar∣ded by three or four, and in the Night by fifteen Halberdeers; but at the King's Chamber thirty Men, most <HI>Chans</HI> Sons, Watch, whil'st as many more go the Rounds. The <HI>Kischicktzi,</HI> or Cap∣tain of the Guard, delivers the King an Account every Evening, of such Persons as are to Watch that Night, that so he may know what People are near him. The said <HI>Forum</HI> over the Gate is a very high Room, glittering with fair Windows on all sides, and adorn'd with rich Pictures, and gilded Carv'd work. The other chief Rooms of the Court, are first the <HI>Tabchane,</HI> or great Hall, in which the King with his <HI>Chans</HI> and other great Lords keeps a splendid Feast on <HI>Naurus,</HI> or <HI>New-years-day:</HI> next, an open Room, call'd the <HI>Divan∣chane,</HI> that is, <HI>House of Justice,</HI> in which the King hears and determines all Businesses of State, and gives Entertainment to foreign Princes. The <HI>Tab∣chane,</HI> or Banquetting-house, ascended by three Steps, is twelve Yards long, eight broad, and abought six high: The Pillars which support the Roof, being eight-square, are of Wood, and Gilded: The Room within is also adorn'd with Gilded Sculpture, or Carv'd-work: The Floor is commonly cover'd with rich Carpets, and hath a Fountain in the middle of it: Before the <HI>Divan∣chane</HI> is a long narrow Walk, Planted with <HI>Tzinar</HI>-Trees: These kind of Walks they call <HI>Chiewan.</HI> The third is the <HI>Haramchane,</HI> or Hall for the Wo∣men, in which his <HI>Casseha,</HI> or Concubines, which are at other times kept up in private Apartments, come together to Dance before the King, to the Musick of several Instruments, or the Voices of Eunuchs. The fourth is the <HI>Deke,</HI> or place in which the King spends his time most part of the day, and ever, but at Festival times, or when bu∣sied about State Affairs, Dines with his Queen and the rest of his Wives. Besides these there are other fair Apartments, which contribute to the splendor and accommodation of a King's Pa∣lace, besides divers brave Banquetting-houses and pleasant Gardens. But above all the rest, about forty Paces from the chief Gate, is a Door on the right-hand which leads to a great Garden, in the middle whereof stands a Chappel. This Garden being a priviledg'd Place, is by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Allacapi,</HI> that is. <HI>Gods Gate.</HI> Hither Debtors, Man-slayers, and other Malefactors, flie for san∣ctuary, and so long as they can maintain them∣selves there at their own Cost and Charge, they are unmolested; but Thieves they will not suffer to be there long.</P>
<P>Behind the Palace is the <HI>Taberick Cale,</HI> or Trea∣sury, being rather a Castle than a House, for the word <HI>Cale</HI> signifies a Castle: It is an indifferent large Structure, encompass'd with high Walls and Redoubts of Earth, which <HI>Nicholas Hemmius</HI> takes to be Towers. This Castle is constandy Garri∣son'd with divers Companies of Soldiers; and the King having a considerable Magazine, often keeps his Court in it. Moreover, on the other side of the <HI>Maidan,</HI> in a peculiar Street, is ano∣ther Sanctuary, or priviledg'd House, call'd <HI>Tse∣che hit Sutun,</HI> so call'd from forty Beams or Pieces of Timber, all which resting upon one single Pil∣ar, which stands in the middle of the <HI>Metzid</HI> be∣longing to it, support the Roof thereof.</P>
<P>Hither the <HI>Persians</HI> flock'd in great numbers, when <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> going to destroy the rebelling Citizens, resolv'd to spare onely the Temple and all those that were in it; for he put to the Sword them that were in the Temple Court, and caus'd all the Houses thereabouts to be pull'd down, which <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> re-building, made it a privi∣ledg'd Place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persians</HI> Belief con∣cerning <HI>Me∣hedi,</HI></NOTE>On the South side of the <HI>Maidan</HI> is a large and sumptuous <HI>Mosque,</HI> which being begun by <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> and almost finish'd, his Successor com∣pleated it, and overlaid the Walls with a rich sort of Marble, brought from <HI>Erwend. Anno</HI> 1037. this <HI>Mosque</HI> was Consecrated to <HI>Mehedi,</HI> the last of their twelve <HI>Imams,</HI> or Saints of the Race of <HI>Aali,</HI> of whom it is vulgarly believ'd, that he lies slumbering in a Cave near <HI>Cusa,</HI> from whence he is expected to return at the <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> and Riding about the World on <HI>Dul∣dul Aaly</HI>'s Horse, to convert all People to the <HI>Alco∣ran;</HI> wherefore it is call'd <HI>Metzid Mehedi Sahese∣man,</HI> which words are inscrib'd over the biggest Gate in <HI>Persian</HI> Characters.</P>
<P>At the end of the great <HI>Hejat,</HI> or Court, before the <HI>Metzit,</HI> is a Gallery or rais'd place, Pav'd with square Stones, in the midst of which is a large Cistern of Water, where those that go to Pray wash themselves. Behind this Cistern you ascend by Steps to a Porch through a Row of Marble Pillars; and one Step higher, to the Temple it self, that being very large and high, and sup∣ported
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>with large Marble Pillars, where the <HI>Me∣herab</HI> or Altar, and the <HI>Cahib</HI> or Vestry is: The Gate is of fine Marble, and as high as that at <HI>Sulthanie,</HI> at the <HI>Meschaich</HI> of <HI>Chodabende;</HI> the en∣trance through which is under an Arch of an ex∣ceeding heighth, of blue Stone Gilded; beyond which is a broad Walk, the Floor whereof is spread with Mats, on which the <HI>Persians</HI> kneel when they Pray. Over the lower Walks are lesser ones like Galleries, supported by Marble Columns gilded. On the right-side of the <HI>Mosque</HI> is a large Garden.</P>
<P>The greatest splendor and magnificence of this <HI>Mosque</HI> is, that all the Walls, Galleries, Gar∣dens, and the chief Temple, are from the bottom four Yards high upwards, cover'd with polish'd Marble, each piece, which is for the most part white, and excellently well polish'd, being five or six Foot square: The Marble is all cut out of one Stone, except the two Pillars on each side of the Pulpit.</P>
<P><HI>Schach Abbas</HI> caus'd the like <HI>Metzid,</HI> though smaller, to be built at <HI>Tabris,</HI> in honor of the same <HI>Mehedi,</HI> all of pure white Marble, and as slick as Glass, being fetch'd from the Mountain <HI>Erwan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Places of Games and Exercises.</NOTE>In the middle of the City, not far from the King's Palace, stands a Pole, not unlike our Posts in which we put the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings that are to be run at, on which they often put a Melon, <HI>Arupus,</HI> or Ap∣ple, and sometimes a Silver Plate with Money up∣on it, at which the King and his <HI>Chans</HI> run full speed for great Wagers, and whoever hits off the same, comes off with great honor and applause; but the Money which falls from the Plate, is ta∣ken up by the Pages and Footmen.</P>
<P>Great Lords also have another Exercise call'd <HI>Kuit Schaucan,</HI> which they perform in the same place, <HI>viz.</HI> Riding full speed, they strike a Ball with a crooked. Stick to a set Mark; and also toss the <HI>Tziud,</HI> or Bar.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Maidan</HI> stands a little woodden Hut nam'd <HI>Chaneschin,</HI> which is set upon four Wheels, for the conveniency of its moving from place to place, in which the King often sits a Spectator of the foremention'd Games.</P>
<P>Hereabouts, especially on the West side, not far from the <HI>Dewletchane,</HI> sit divers Soothsayers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses of En∣tertainment.</NOTE>Opposite to the Northern part of the <HI>Maidan</HI> stand several Houses of Entertainment; the first whereof is the <HI>Schire Chane,</HI> to which resort the most loose und debauch'd sort of People, who hire the <HI>Surkers,</HI> or Dancing-Boys, as also com∣mon Strumpets, to Dance before them naked, with all kind of leud and obscene Postures.</P>
<P>The second is the <HI>Tzai,</HI> or the <HI>Chattai Chane,</HI> that is, <HI>The Catayan,</HI> or <HI>Chinese Tee-house,</HI> in which they generally play at <HI>Chess.</HI></P>
<P>The third is the <HI>Caweh Chane,</HI> or <HI>Coffee and To∣bacco-house.</HI></P>
<P>These three Houses are also frequented by their Pot-Poets and Comedians, who commonly sitting in the midst of the House on high Stools, tell all manner of pleasant Tales, and talk conti∣nually with a little Stick in their Hands like our Juglers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbers Shops.</NOTE>Not far from these Houses two sorts of Bar∣bers keep their Shops; some whereof practising Chirurgery, and call'd <HI>Tezerrah,</HI> never shave or Trim Men; the other call'd <HI>Dellack,</HI> shave and cut Hair, and are made use of to Circumcise Chil∣dren. To this last sort of Barbers there is conti∣nual resort of People, because they always keep their Heads shav'd, and every one brings his own Rasor with him, because the <HI>Persians</HI> fearing the Venereal Distemper, will not suffer a strange Rasor to touch their Heads.</P>
<P>From the North part of the <HI>Maidan</HI> you go directly to the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Street full of Shops, where there is a square large <HI>Portico,</HI> under which are all manner of rich Merchandise to be sold; over the Entrance of which is a stately Dial, which is said to have been made in <HI>Schach Abbas</HI>'s time by an <HI>English</HI>-man, call'd <HI>Festy,</HI> which at first (there being then no Clocks nor Dials in all <HI>Persia</HI>) was look'd upon as a great Wonder.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market-house it self, is divided into many Divisions, with Passages between them like little Lanes, which are most of them cover'd on the top, where all manner of Goods that the Countrey affords are to be sold, every thing in a peculiar place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The famous Coffee-house in <HI>Ispahan.</HI></NOTE>In the <HI>Caravansera</HI> near the <HI>Bazar,</HI> where the King receives foreign Ambassadors, is a House, which is one of the fairest in the whole City <HI>I∣spahan,</HI> and call'd <HI>The Coffee-house,</HI> from the Liquor which is sold in it. In this House also are brought up Youths of several Nations, but most <HI>Mahume∣tans,</HI> though some are of <HI>Christian</HI> Parentage, as <HI>Circassians, Georgians,</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> who are taught all manner of Dances. At the Entrance of this House is a Court with a Fountain in the midst of it. The King oftentimes Dines here with foreign Ambassadors, but is satisfi'd with few Dishes, having sometimes but two, whereof one is Mutton, the other roasted Poultrey, which whil'st he is eating, the Youths Dance before him in a very strange and ridiculous manner.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ispahan</HI> dwell also Merchants and Shop∣keepers of several Nations, of which some sell their Goods by Wholesale, others by Retail; for besides the <HI>Persians, Indians, Tartars</HI> from <HI>Chua∣ressam, Chineses,</HI> and those from <HI>Buchare,</HI> there are <HI>English, Dutch, French, Italians, Spaniards, Portu∣guese, Turks, Jews, Armenians,</HI> and <HI>Georgians.</HI> The <HI>Indians,</HI> who generally have their Shops next to the <HI>Persians,</HI> Trade in Silk, Cotton, and other such like Stuffs.</P>
<P>By reason of the great Trade in <HI>Ispahan</HI> there are many <HI>Caravansera's,</HI> where the several Com∣modities are dispos'd of by Wholesale.</P>
<P>Amongst other places , the Kings Parks for wild Beasts are none of the meanest, having tow∣erd Lodges, call'd <HI>Kelemenar,</HI> inclos'd with Walls, made of several sorts of Deers, and other Beasts Horns, mix'd with Earth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Garden <HI>Izarbag.</HI></NOTE>Without the City Walls, not far from the great Bridge, on the South side, is a Garden call'd <HI>Tzarbag,</HI> which hath not its equal for curiosity and delight in all <HI>Persia.

<P>On the other side of the River <HI>Senderuth</HI> lie the Suburbs <HI>Tabrisabath,</HI> otherwise <HI>Abasabath,</HI> so call'd, because <HI>Scach Abbas</HI> brought the Inhabitants thi∣ther from <HI>Tabris.</HI></P>
<P>Another part of the Suburbs call'd <HI>Hassenabath,</HI> is inhabited by <HI>Castilians,</HI> brought thither from <HI>Georgia,</HI> they are great Merchants, and, like the <HI>Armenians,</HI> travel from one Countrey to another.</P>

When any one dies, they drive a Cock in∣to the Fields out of the House of the Deceased, which if it be caught by a Fox, then they believe that the Soul of the Deceased is taken up into a better World; but if this proof chance to be hindred by any Accident, then they try another way, on which their assurance chiefly depends, <HI>viz.</HI> they carry the Corps clad with their best Appa∣rel, and adorn'd with Gold Chains and other Or∣naments, to the Church-yard, where they set the Body up against the Wall, propping up the same by placing a Pole under the Chin, where if the Fowls of the Air pick out the right Eye, then they assuredly believe the Soul to be ascended to Heaven; but if the left, they judge it to be gone to Hell. They have also two sorts of Graves, in one they tenderly lay the Bodies of their supposed Saints; and into the other, those whom they believe to be Damn'd are thrown headlong.</P>

<P>Besides this there are several other Structures (upon what occasion built we find not) on the said Mountain; but the greatest Wonder is, how such a quantity of Brick or Stone could be carry'd up such a vast heighth, it requiring above three hours time to get to the top, by reason of the steepness of the Mountain.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Casbin.</HI></NOTE><HI>Casbin</HI> (as the same <HI>Texeira</HI> and <HI>Olearius</HI> have it) is a City belonging to the Province of <HI>Parthia</HI> or <HI>Erack;</HI> notwithstanding <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> makes it a peculiar Kingdom, and is in some Maps plac'd near <HI>Aderbajon,</HI> in others farther towards the North-East than <HI>Rey Xarear.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Situation and Descri∣ption.</NOTE>The City <HI>Casbin</HI> or <HI>Caswin,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Cas∣bin,</HI> and formerly <HI>Arsatia,</HI> lies (as the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> inform us) in 85 Degrees Longitude, and 36 Degrees and 15 Minutes Northern Latitude, as <HI>Olearius</HI> hath also observ'd: It is situate on a barren and sandy Plain; about half a days Journey from which, on the South side, begin the high Moun∣tains <HI>Elwend,</HI> which extend South-West towards <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon.</HI> The City is a League in cir∣cumference, hath no Walls, nor any Soldiers in Garrison, because it lies a great way from an Ene∣my, yet (as they say) hath a hundred thousand In∣habitants, out of which on all occasions a good Army might easily be rais'd. The ordinary Hou∣ses are built of Stone after the <HI>Persian</HI> manner, which, though they seem mean on the out-side, yet are handsome and well contriv'd within, ha∣ving several Apartments, white, or else curiously Painted. All the Streets being unpav'd, and the Ground naturally sandy, the least Wind raises Dust, and makes it very troublesom walking to the Inhabitants. There are no Springs nor Wells, but all the Water is convey'd from the Mountains in Pipes laid under Ground into publick Cisterns, where it is free for every ones use. There are also many Conservatories, wherein they keep Ice and Snow to use in Summer. The City hath two great <HI>Maidans</HI> or Market-places, the chiefest whereof is call'd <HI>Atmaidan,</HI> being somewhat longer than that of <HI>Ardebil,</HI> though not so broad. On the South side thereof stand large and magnificent Structures, built most of them by the Princes or <HI>Chans</HI> of <HI>Persia.</HI> In the <HI>Bazars</HI> or Shops of this Market-place, as also in the <HI>Senke Maidan,</HI> which lies more Westward, commonly all manner of Rarities and rich Merchandizes are to be had at reasonable Rates, especially <HI>Turkoises,</HI> Rubies, and Granates: But after Sun-set another kind of Trade is driven on the East side of the <HI>Maidan, viz.</HI> divers <HI>Cahbeha,</HI> or Girls of Pleasure, stand in a long Row with cover'd Faces, holding up their Coats, and behind every one of them an old Wo∣man call'd <HI>Delal,</HI> who carries a Cushion and Blan∣ket, or Cotton Quilt on their Backs, and an un∣lighted Candle in their Hands, which, as soon as any one comes and discourses with the <HI>Cahbeha,</HI> she lights, and presents the Party; whereupon he turning up their Vails, bids her whom he fancies best follow him</P>
<P>In this City are likewise above fifty <HI>Metzids</HI> or Temples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temples,</NOTE> whither the <HI>Persians</HI> daily go to their Devotions; the chiefest is <HI>Tzame Metzid,</HI> towards the South, not far from the <HI>Maidan,</HI> where their Sabbath or <HI>Friday</HI> Meeting is principally celebra∣ted. There are also many well built <HI>Caravanse∣ra's</HI> for strange Merchants, and likewise many publick Baths.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Palace.</NOTE>Near the great <HI>Maidan</HI> is a large and Royal Pa∣lace, with an Orchard of vast extent belonging to it, built by <HI>Schach Ismael,</HI> some say <HI>Schach Thomas;</HI> the Portico's and Arches are of Stone, Painted and Gilded; but the Rooms within are adorn'd with Sculpture and Imagery, richly Gilded also and Painted, all in Grotesque-work after the <HI>Persian</HI> manner.</P>
<P>Over against this Palace is another Orchard, a Mile in circumference, in which are divers Ban∣quetting-houses, and handsom Walks Set with all sorts of Fruit-Trees, as Apples, Pears, Peaches, <HI>Morello's,</HI> Granates, Almonds, and the like; but the cross Ways are the pleasantest, being neatly Planted with tall <HI>Tzinar</HI> and Cypress-Trees, which make a very delightful Prospect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bath <HI>Haman Cha∣rabe</HI> made fa∣mous by the Story of <HI>Lockman.</HI></NOTE>Behind the King's Palace and Garden is an old decay'd Bath, which they call <HI>Haman Charabe,</HI> and tell the following Story of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That at <HI>Cas∣win</HI> there formerly dwelt a famous Physician call'd <HI>Lockman,</HI> an <HI>Arabian Black</HI> born, whom the <HI>Persians,</HI> not onely for his excellent Books of Physick which he writ, but also for his great Judgment in all things, had in great veneration. This <HI>Lockman</HI> was believ'd by the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> to have liv'd amongst the <HI>Israelites</HI> in <HI>David</HI>'s time, and to have been a Servant or Slave of one <HI>Abyssine,</HI> and that he was no less deform'd. Some will have him to be the same with <HI>Esop;</HI> others, that he liv'd in the time of <HI>Solomon: Texeira</HI> is of opinion, that he liv'd in the time of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> the first grand <HI>Persian</HI> Monarch. It is farther deliver'd, that when this <HI>Lockman</HI> being arriv'd at the utmost period of old Age, perceiv'd the hour of Death approaching, he gave his Son three Glasses full of precious Water, with advice, that the same would fetch a dead Corps to life again, provided it were not putrifi'd; that if they sprinkled the Water which was in the first Glass on the Dead, it would make them breathe again, and stir their Limbs; that the se∣cond Water would make them rise, and the third restore them to perfect health. But <HI>Lockman</HI> al∣ledg'd, that it was a great Sin for a Man to un∣dertake that which belong'd onely to God, <HI>viz.</HI> to restore Life to the Dead, and therefore he would not suffer this piece of Art to be often practis'd, but onely in time of need, to shew what the pro∣found knowledge of Nature could do, and there∣fore strictly commanded his Son <HI>Lockman Sade</HI> to forbear the practise of it, who accordingly would not try the Vertue of the Water on his deceased Father; but soon after falling sick himself, he commanded his Servant to try the Experiment upon him as soon as the Breath should be departed out of his Body, having first laid the Corps in a warm Bath, where the Water was to be us'd, ac∣cording to the foremention'd Instruction. After <HI>Lockman Sade</HI>'s Decease, the Servant, to perform his Master's last Command, carry'd the Body to the <HI>Haman</HI> or Bath, and pour'd the two first Glas∣ses of Water on him, whereupon the dead Body began to move and rise up; but as he was prepa∣ring to poure out the third Viol, the half reco∣ver'd Body cry'd suddenly <HI>Bris, Bris,</HI> that is,

Some say that an Angel struck the Glass out of his Ser∣vants Hand: Moreover, a Voice crying <HI>Bris, Bris,</HI> is (as the Inhabitants confidently affirm) heard at this day near the foremention'd Bath, call'd <HI>Haman Charabe.</HI></P>

<P>This City <HI>Casbin</HI> hath been the Residence and Seat of the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> ever since the Reign of <HI>Schach Thamas,</HI> who is said to have been the first that remov'd his Seat from <HI>Tabris</HI> thither.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperature of the Air.</NOTE>It is almost incredible how cold it is in <HI>Ispahan</HI> from <HI>November</HI> till <HI>March,</HI> notwithstanding the City lies in one and thirty Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude; but of this no other reason is generally given, but the pureness and thinnes of the Air.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>The Soil about <HI>Ispahan</HI> is much lower than the Stream <HI>Senderuth;</HI> by which means Nature pre∣vents the great inconveniences which the exces∣sive Heat would occasion here in Summer, the In∣habitants being able to overflow their Lands and Gardens when they please, which <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> says infects the Air; but this is contradicted by <HI>Davity,</HI> and it is certain that the Air about <HI>Ispahan</HI> is the wholsomest of all <HI>Persia,</HI> except in some pla∣ces near the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>In and about <HI>Ispahan</HI> is plenty of all sorts of Pro∣visions; and the Mountains lying on each side of the City, are also very fruitful, and the Way from <HI>Ispahan</HI> to <HI>Arabia</HI> full of great Woods. The same Countrey also produces excellent Wine, the best whereof is as good as Canary; and of all sorts of Fruits, the best in the World. Moreover, the Countrey about <HI>Caxion</HI> abounds with all manner of Fruits.</P>
<P>About the City of King <HI>Xarear,</HI> the Inhabi∣tants gather abundance of <HI>Manna,</HI> but it is not so pure and good as that of <HI>Hrey.</HI></P>
<P>This Province likewise abounds with Horses and Mules, and such lusty strong Cartel, that they carry near double the Burthen of others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scorpions of <HI>Cashan.</HI></NOTE>There is no place in all <HI>Persia</HI> that is more in∣fested with Scorpions than <HI>Cashan;</HI> wherefore if they would wish any ill to befall a man, they com∣monly say, <HI>Acrab Cashan de Bestet stenet,</HI> that is, <HI>May Cashan Scorpions sting you in the Head:</HI> Some that are most poysonous are Coal-black, and about the big∣ness of a Man's Finger in thickness and length; They run very fast, and are in shape not unlike a Cra-fish, onely they have a blunter Head, and less Body. By reason of these Animals the Inhabi∣tants never sleep in Ground-Rooms, but in upper Stories, call'd <HI>Tzarmi.</HI> The Townsmen say, that a Stranger coming into the City, and crying, <HI>Men Caribem,</HI> that is, <HI>I am a Stranger,</HI> the Scorpi∣ons will not meddle with him. The most general Cure against the Stings of these Scorpions, is a piece of Copper suddenly clapt on the Wound; wherefore the Inhabitants continually carry the
<PB N="20" REF="32"/>Copper Coin call'd <HI>Pull</HI> about them, which they immediately lay on the place where they are bit, and letting it lie a pretty while, they afterwards anoint it with Honey and Vinegar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Taran∣tula</HI> of <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE>There is likewise another sort of Animal about the City <HI>Cashan</HI> almost like a Spider (for some hang by Threds and Cobwebs on the Trees,) and are by the <HI>Petsians</HI> call'd <HI>Eubureckhan,</HI> and by the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards, Tarantula;</HI> they breed in Rocky places for the most part, under a certain Shrub with broad and strong scented Leaves, by the <HI>Persians</HI> nam'd <HI>Tremne,</HI> and by the <HI>Turks, Jau∣schan.</HI> These Vermine touching any part of a Man's Body, leave a drop of Poyson on it like a drop of Water, which causes great pain, and strikes into the Stomach, makes the Head to ake, and benumming all the Limbs, casts the Party into a deadly Sleep, out of which he cannot be awak'd by any means whatsoever, so long as the Poyson remains upon him, being for the time bereav'd of natural Sense. The best Remedy is to kill the Animal, and lay the same on the benumm'd parts, which (they say) draws out the Poyson again; but if none of them can be got, then they lay the Patient on his Back, poure as much Milk down his Throat as possibly they can, notwithstanding he immediately disgorges the same; then they put him into a Trough, which hanging up by three Strings, they turn round till the Patient's Head being very giddy, he is provok'd to vomit up all he hath in his Stomach, and to Urine (though not without great pain) a white and thick Water, which eases the Patient, who nevertheless at certain times in the year endures great pain, occasion'd by the re∣maining Poyson. But that which is the greatest wonder of these Animals is, that the Sheep run very eagerly after them, and eat them without the least hurt.</P>

The same sort of Melons are to be found in several other places in <HI>Persia,</HI> as also a very strange kind of Cucumbers, which are near three Yards long, crooked, and about the thickness of a Man's Arm, and therefore call'd <HI>Schunchiar,</HI> or <HI>Crooked Cucumbers,</HI> which, like Gurkins, are laid in Vinegar and Salt, and eaten raw.</P>

<P>Within the compass of a hundred and fifty years last past, this City hath undergone sundry Mutations, both by the great <HI>Turk</HI> and the <HI>Persians:</HI> for in the Year 1514. it was surrendred to <HI>Selymus</HI> the <HI>Turk,</HI> who contrary to his Word exacted a great mass of Money from the Inhabitants, and carry'd away with him three thousand Families, amongst whom were the best Artificers in the City. Afterwards in the Year 1535. it was by <HI>Solyman</HI> wholly given up to merciless rage and avarice of his Soldiers, who left neither House nor Corner thereof unplunder'd, abusing the miserable Citizens with all manner of insolency; besides the most stately Palace of King <HI>Thamas,</HI> together with the most sumptuous and rich Houses of the Nobility, were by the great <HI>Turk</HI>'s Command∣ment all ras'd down to the Ground, and the great∣test part of the best Citizens, and beautifullest Per∣sons of what Condition or Quality soever, were carry'd away Captives. And in the Year 1585. it was miserably spoyl'd by <HI>Osman,</HI> Visier unto <HI>Amu∣rat</HI> the Third, and remain'd near four and thirty years under the <HI>Turkish</HI> Slavery; during which time the poor Inhabitants suffer'd most unheard-of Miseries, through the countenanc'd Outrages and barbarous Cruelties of <HI>Osman</HI>'s Soldiers. But in the Year 1603. <HI>Abbas</HI> having obtain'd the Crown of <HI>Persia,</HI> march'd with great expedition to <HI>Tauris,</HI> and (what with the inclination of the Citizens to∣wards him, by reason of their extream aversion to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Government, and the use of the Can∣non he brought with him, which till that time the <HI>Persians</HI> scorn'd, as not becoming valiant Men) af∣ter six Weeks Siege took the City.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all the several Brunts that this City underwent, <HI>Minadoi</HI> affirms, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1607. it had six Leagues in circumference; but since that time also the Calamities and Ruines of War have fall'n heavy upon it, especially in the Year 1618. wherein <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> caus'd it to be wholly de∣serted and lest desolate, upon the <HI>Turkish</HI> Armies approach.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultania <HI>built by</HI> Sul∣tan Choda bende.</NOTE>About half a League from this City, on the right hand of the Way which comes from <HI>Hame∣dan,</HI> stands a large Stone Gate and Tower, belong∣ing to the City, and is said to be the remainder of an old Palace, which, as likewise the whole City, was built by <HI>Sultan Muhammed Chodabende,</HI> a <HI>Tartar</HI> of the Family of the <HI>Usbechies,</HI> out of the Ruines of the City <HI>Tigranocerta</HI> (of which <HI>Tacitus</HI> makes mention in several places,) as appears by the Name of <HI>Sultania;</HI> for till after his time the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> did not Intitle themselves <HI>Schach,</HI> but <HI>Sultan,</HI> as the <HI>Turks</HI> do at this day; as also from an Inscription on his Tomb yet to be seen.</P>
<P>The Fields about this City (as the Inhabitants relate) were formerly very unfruitful; but King <HI>Chodabende</HI> Cultivating the same, made it not onely very fertile, but also exceeding pleasant, moistening it with Water, which was con¦vey'd a great way under Ground in Pipes. They add moreover, that the same Night that the fore∣mention'd King dy'd (who was going about to add to the Building of the City, and to fill the same with a new supply of Inhabitants, fetch'd from other Countries) the People that were then in it began to leave it, insomuch that in that Night fourteen thousand Women march'd out of the same on seven thousand Cammels, two on each Cammel: Nevertheless after this it flourish'd for some time, and was daily increasing in Riches and Repute, when <HI>Chotza Reschid,</HI> King of <HI>Persia</HI> (whom <HI>Josaphat Barbaro</HI> calls <HI>Giausam</HI>) upon a Mutiny of the Inhabitants, destroy'd a great part of it; and not long after <HI>Tamerlane</HI> compleated the destru∣ction thereof: There remains a great part of the Walls of a very strong and sumptuous Castle, which was also the King's Palace, built of Free∣ston<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with many square Towers, of which some are yet to be seen; but the onely Structures stand∣ing yet in view, are two <HI>Meschaiches,</HI> or <HI>Mosques,</HI> wherein <HI>Sultan Mahumeth Chodabende</HI> lies bury'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of <HI>Cho∣dabende</HI>'s Tomb.</NOTE> the Inscription on whose Tomb (as we said before) speaks him the Builder of <HI>Sultania,</HI> all things about the same being exceeding curious, and above all, its three Gates, though not of Copper (as <HI>Bizarro</HI> writes) yet of polish'd Steel. The greatest Gate, which is opposite to the <HI>Maidan</HI> or Market, can∣not (as they say) be open'd, though never so many Men endeavor it, unless they speak these words, <HI>Beask Aly Buckscha,</HI> that is, <HI>Be open'd for Aly's sake,</HI> and then it turns so easily upon the Hinges, that a Child may open it. The Roof is very high, and rises by degrees towards the middle into a round Tower: The Walls are overlaid with white and blue glaz'd Stones, form'd into several Shapes and Characters: It hath a Gallery or long Walk jut∣ting out like a Balcony, over which are certain Repositories, where there lie several <HI>Arabian</HI> Books, some a quarter of a Yard deep and three quarters long; the Characters in them are three Inches long, and every second Line neatly written with Gold and Ink, all transcrib'd out of the <HI>Al∣coran.</HI> Several Leaves of one of these Books came to the hands of <HI>Olearius,</HI> who kept them as a great Rarity.</P>
<P>At the farther end of this Temple, in the Way towards the <HI>Meherab</HI> or Altar, the Tomb of the Sultan <HI>Mahumed Chodabende</HI> appears through a very fine polish'd Grate, which is accounted a great piece of Art, because it is made of <HI>Indian</HI> Steel, each Bar about the thickness of a Man's Arm, and all of them so neatly joyn'd together, that no Joynts are seen; it is said that it was cut out of a whole Piece, as also the Gate, and that seven years were spent in <HI>India</HI> about the making of them. Moreover there are two great Guns to be seen in the same <HI>Emerad</HI> or <HI>Mosque,</HI> with a Mortar∣piece, each plac'd on Carriages with four Wheels, besides Demi-cannons, and other Field-pieces, which belong to the Castle: On the Mortar-piece is the Figure of a Spread-eagle, and over it two Letters, <HI>A</HI> and <HI>Z:</HI> The Bullets thereto belong∣ing are of Marble. The Tower which crowns this Structure is eight-square, and surrounded on the top with a Gallery; a little above which stand eight little Spires like Pillars, to which there is an Ascent by winding Stairs. Before the Temple is a great square Well, which receiving its Water from the Mountain <HI>Keider,</HI> is inclos'd within a Wall; behind which is a large pleasant Garden, Planted with Rows of high and low Trees, and a stately Banquetting-house in the middle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Schach Isma∣el<HI>'s Mosque.</HI></NOTE>The other <HI>Metzid</HI> was built by <HI>Schach Ismael</HI> the first: the Entrance into the same is through a very high Door, over which stands a round Tower; near which also rises a high Pyramid, surrounded by eight Marble Columns. The Temple it self hath lofty Arches and Pillars, as also Galleries round about, and in the middle a very high Pulpit. To this Structure belongs a very pleasant Garden, and in it a Tower, whose top ends in the form of a Pyramid. But the most beautiful part of the <HI>Mosque</HI> is a peculiar place built like a Chappel, and separated by a Partition from the rest of the <HI>Mosque:</HI> In the middle of it, opposite to the Door, stands like an Altar, a large Tomb, built for one of the <HI>Sultans,</HI> and cover'd with rich Cloth-of-Gold and Silk. This Chappel is enter'd at an Iron Door, neatly Carv'd and Gilded.</P>
<P>Not far from this Temple stands a high Arch, which seems to be the Ruines of an old triumphal Arch, built between two Towers above a hundred Foot high.</P>
<P>A days Journey from <HI>Sultania</HI> lies the Village <HI>Chorademh,</HI> pleasantly seated among shady Woods and Gardens, and by a sweet River.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Ardebil,</HI> by the <HI>Turks</HI> call'd <HI>Ardevil,</HI> and in the Maps wrongly spell'd <HI>Ardonil,</HI> is an an∣cient City, and of great repute amongst the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI> partly for being the Seat and Burying-place of divers ancient Kings, especially of <HI>Schach Sefi,</HI> who also was born there; and secondly for its great Trade to all parts: It is said that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, in his Journey to <HI>Persia,</HI> kept his Court there for a considerable time; and it appears the more probable, in regard of the affinity of its Name with <HI>Arbela,</HI> of which <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> makes mention: It lies in 38 Degrees and 5 Mi∣nutes Northern Latitude, and in 82 Degrees and 30 Minutes Longitude, thirty seven Leagues Westward from <HI>Sultania,</HI> on a Plain three Leagues over, and surrounded with high Hills; the highest whereof, call'd <HI>Sebelahu,</HI> lies West ward, and is ne∣ver without Snow; but towards the South-East is the Mountain <HI>Bacru.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ardebil</HI> is somewhat bigger in circumference than <HI>Schamachie,</HI> though without Walls: Each
<PB N="23" REF="35"/>House hath an Orchard belonging to it, which makes it seem rather a Wood than a City; yet there is no Timber there fit for Building, but what is brought thither from the Province of <HI>Kilan.</HI> Through the City flows a little Brook call'd <HI>Bacuchlu,</HI> which coming out of the Village <HI>Schamasbu,</HI> a League Southward from the City, and having over it several Stone Bridges, di∣vides it self into two Branches just before the Town; the one runs quite through, and the other gliding about by the left side, falls into the Stream <HI>Carasu.</HI> By reason of the abundance of Snow, which melting in <HI>June,</HI> and running down from the Mountains, this Brook swells into a great Stream, so that if it were not led in time over an adjacent Plain (which is done by casting up a Bank before the River,) it would quite drown the City, as it hapned in the time of <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> when the Water breaking through, carry'd away a great number of Houses, and drowned many People and Cattel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Streets.</NOTE>Besides many little Streets, this City hath five eminent ones, <HI>viz. Derwane, Tabar, Niardawar, Cambalan,</HI> and <HI>Cafircutze,</HI> all of them pretty broad, and Planted with Ash and Willow Trees, which afford the Inhabitants a pleasant Shade in Sum∣mer. There is also a great <HI>Maidan</HI> or Market-place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Market-place.</NOTE> three hundred Paces long, and half as broad, full of Shops on each side, wherein Trades∣men of sundry Vocations have their Shops apart, each Trade by it self; wherein at the Entrance thereof, on the right side, behind <HI>Schach Sefi</HI>'s Tomb, is a <HI>Metzid</HI> or Temple, wherein <HI>Imam Sade,</HI> one of their twelve chief Saints, lies bury'd. If a Malefactor escape thither, he is secure from being Apprehended, and may from thence im∣mediately get to <HI>Schach Sefi</HI>'s Tomb, which is a place of greater priviledge. Behind the <HI>Maidan</HI> is a <HI>Bazar</HI> or Exchange, where under a high square Roof call'd <HI>Caisere,</HI> are sold all manner of Gold and Silver Works, Precious Stones, rich Silks, and other Commodities.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of <HI>Schach Se∣fi</HI>'s Tomb.</NOTE>Not far from the <HI>Maidan</HI> is the foremention'd stately Tomb of <HI>Schach Sefi,</HI> one of the most re∣nowned of the late Kings of <HI>Persia.</HI> The Gate through which you must go into the first Court is exceeding large; from the top of which hangs a great Silver Chain, which the <HI>Chan</HI> of <HI>Merraga</HI> is said to have Offer'd with great Devotion: The Court, which is very large, and Pav'd with great square Stones, hath on each side long and high Arch'd Walls, under which are several Shops; and behind the Court a pleasant Garden, where every one may freely recreate themselves. Not far from hence is another Gate, over which hangs also a Silver Chain in a Triangle, plac'd there by <HI>Mahumed Chan</HI> and <HI>Kentz.</HI> No man is permit∣ted to enter into this Temple with any manner of Weapon, not so much as with a Knife, upon pain of Death: The Threshold of this Gate is of white Marble, Carv'd round in form of a Pil∣lar, and not to be trod upon, but stept over with the right Leg foremost, because many thou∣sands coming to the Tomb kiss the same. On the right side of the Garden is a Fountain of ex∣cellent clear Water, which through a great Cop∣per Spout made fast in the Wall, is convey'd thi∣ther in Pipes from the Mountains, lying a League from thence, and serves those for Drink that are Dieted there. At the end of the Garden on the same side, is a fair, spacious, and round Arch of green and blue Stone, in the middle whereof are two great Copper Candle-sticks. Round about the Walls are Seats, wherein the Priests, Cloth'd in white Apparel, us'd to Sing. It is a Tradition, that <HI>Schach Sefi</HI> us'd to sit every year forty days to∣gether here, Fasting and Praying, his daily Suste∣nance being onely one Almond and a little Wa∣ter, from whence it is call'd <HI>Tschillachane.</HI> Out of this Court you pass through another Gate, where there also hangs a Silver Chain, given by <HI>Allican, Chan</HI> of <HI>Gappan.</HI> The Entrance into the Tomb is under a pretty large Room over which is a round Tower, through a Door Plated with Silver, and adorn'd with thick Silver Rings: The Floor at the Entrance is spread with Carpets, on which those that will pass to the Tomb must walk bare∣footed. When <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> came to visit this Tomb, he pull'd off his Shoes half a League be∣fore he came to the City, and walk'd thither bare∣footed, in testimony of the great zeal he bore to this Saint. This Entry hath a little Wicket on one side, cover'd with Plates of Gold, which leads to a stately Room. It is said that <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> made this Door, as also another at the <HI>Meschet</HI> in <HI>Chorazan,</HI> before <HI>Imam Risa</HI>'s Tomb, upon the ma∣king of a certain Vow at the time of his marching against the <HI>Usbechies</HI> in <HI>Chorazan,</HI> viz. <HI>That if these Saints would help him to drive the Enemy out of</HI> Cho∣razan, <HI>he would give each of them a Golden Door:</HI> which he accordingly perform'd after his Victory. The Vault is forty eight Foot long, and thirty broad, and set round with many Silver and Gold Branches for Lamps, of an extraordinary large size; near which commonly sit twelve Singing Priests call'd <HI>Hafisan,</HI> with little Stools before them, on which lie great Parchment Books, in which as they look, they move their Bodies after the same manner as those in the <HI>Tschillachane.</HI> Pas∣sing through this Vault you come into a kind of <HI>Sacristy,</HI> ascended unto by three Silver Steps, with Rails and Balasters likewise of Silver. The <HI>Persians</HI> commonly kiss these Stairs before they go up the same. This Room is exceeding costly, and rises with another Step, upon which a Rail of massy Gold runs cross the Room, and behind it the Tomb of <HI>Schach Sefi,</HI> made of polish'd Marble (not of Gold, as some say,) three Foot high from the Ground, about nine long, and four broad. The Door of the Golden Rail is always lock'd, and may not be open'd to any mortal Man, not to the King himself. On the left hand of this Room is another Vault, in which <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> the First,
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>with several other Kings, lie bury'd. On the right side of the foremention'd Entrance is a great Vaulted Room, curiously Gilded, and re∣sembling a Church, the Cieling adorn'd with se∣veral pieces of Carv'd Work, but not supported by any Pillars. This Room, being call'd <HI>Tzenet∣sera,</HI> is the Library, where the Books lie in seve∣veral Chests, not set side by side, but heap'd one upon the other, and lock'd up; they are most of them in <HI>Arabick,</HI> but some in the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Language, written neatly either on Paper or Parchment, and the Histories adorn'd with va∣rious Sculptures. In divers corners of this Room are Shelves and Cupboards full of <HI>Porcelane</HI> Dishes, and other Vessels, of which some contain the quantity of three Gallons, wherein the King and other Lords are serv'd when they come hi∣ther; for this being a sacred Place, and a holy Gift, no Silver or Golden Vessels are to be us'd in it: and it is said, that <HI>Schach Sefi</HI> was wont, out of zeal and humility, to eat here out of wood∣den Platters. Opposite to the Library or <HI>Tze∣netsera,</HI> is the Kitchin, the Door whereof <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d also to be Plated with Silver: Eve∣ry thing in the same is kept very neat; divers large Cauldrons or Boyling-places are made in the Wall, with great Covers to them; The Wa∣ter convey'd in Pipes round about the Kitchin, and let into great Vessels by Copper Cocks. Out of this Kitchin above a thousand Servants belonging to the Temple, besides a great number of Alms-People, receive their Allowance three times a day, namely, Morning, Noon, and Night: The two first times of Serving are from <HI>Schach Sefi</HI>'s Donation (in which are daily spent about a hundred and fifty <HI>Aba's,</HI> or three <HI>Tomams,</HI> which is fifty Crowns;) but the third Service is on the King's Account. These Meal-times are proclaim'd by two Officers, who go about beat∣ing on Kettle-Drums, which (as 'tis said) were us'd by <HI>Mahumed,</HI> and brought thither by <HI>Schach Sedredin,</HI> together with <HI>Medine</HI>'s Flag; upon which Signal every one repairs thither, and re∣ceives from the Butlers and <HI>Manciples</HI> in a Dish, Broth, Flesh, and Rice, in such plenty, that ma∣ny not able to cat all themselves, sell it to those that are asham'd to fetch it. Out of the Kitchin you go into the Garden, where are the Graves of <HI>Sultan Aider, Schach Thomas,</HI> and other Kings that lie bury'd under the open Skie, without either Tomb-stone or any thing else.</P>
<P>The chiefest Persons that lie bury'd in several places of this <HI>Meschaich,</HI> are <HI>Schach Sefi,</HI> Son of <HI>Seid Tzeibrail; Schach Sedredin,</HI> Son of <HI>Sefi; Schach Tzinid,</HI> Son of <HI>Sedredin,</HI> in the <HI>European</HI> Histories by a mistake call'd <HI>Guined; Sultan Aider,</HI> Son of <HI>Tzinid,</HI> who was flay'd alive by the <HI>Turks; Schach Aider,</HI> Son of <HI>Sultan Aider; Schach Ismael,</HI> Son of <HI>Aider; Schach Thomas,</HI> Son of <HI>Schach Ismael; Schach Ismael,</HI> the second Son of <HI>Schach Thomas; Schach Mahumed Chodabende,</HI> Son of <HI>Ismael; Ismael Myrsa,</HI> and <HI>Chodabende Hemsa Myrsa,</HI> Brothers, and Sons to <HI>Schach Abbas.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">By whom this Tomb was built.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> relate, that a Platform of this above described Tomb, was dictated by <HI>Schach Sedredin,</HI> to the chief Architect, whom he em∣ploy'd in building it after a wonderful manner; that is to say, he caus'd him to shut his Eyes, and shew'd him, as in a Dream, a stately Edifice, according to which he built the foremention'd Structure; which <HI>Schach Tzinid</HI> hath enlarg'd, adding a base Court and several Houses to it, so that now it is like a great Castle, with a conti∣nual concourse of People walking up and down there, as in a little City: It hath great allow∣ance from the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Revenues be∣longing to it.</NOTE> besides other Revenues and daily Presents, which makes it worth many Millions; nay, 'tis said that this <HI>Metzid</HI> is able in time of War, with ready Money to raise more Men than the King; for besides the great Sums in yearly Money, it hath many Houses and Lands belonging to it, which either pay Rent or Taxes to the same, which amounts in all to to a consi∣derable Treasury, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Ardebil</HI> are two hundred Houses, nine <HI>Hamans</HI> or Baths, eight <HI>Caravanse∣ra's,</HI> the great Vaulted Exchange, with all the Shops and Walks about it; a hundred other Shops in the <HI>Bazar,</HI> the Cattel, Corn, Salt, and Oyl-Market; the <HI>Afrabnischins,</HI> which are those that sell their Goods in Tents; of the Villages belonging to <HI>Ardebil,</HI> thirty three belong to the said Tomb, as also five Houses in <HI>Serab;</HI> in the City <HI>Tabris,</HI> sixty Houses and a hundred Shops, besides two Villages near the City; several <HI>Ca∣ravansera's</HI> and Baths in the City <HI>Caswin,</HI> as also in the Provinces of <HI>Kilan</HI> and <HI>Astara;</HI> in the Plains of <HI>Mochan,</HI> the Villages <HI>Abchur</HI> and <HI>Eles∣chur,</HI> with divers others in the Counties <HI>Chalchal, Kermuth,</HI> and <HI>Hascheruth,</HI> besides what comes out of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> where several Places inclin'd to the <HI>Persian</HI> Religion, pay also Tribute to the same. Moreover, it is a Custom amongst the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI> that when they go to Travel, or undertake any Business of concernment, or when they are in Sickness or Trouble, they make great Vows to <HI>Schach Sefi,</HI> which they perform as surely and wil∣lingly, as they would desire to be sav'd; nay, many of them, when they come to celebrate the annual Obsequies of their Saint, bring great Pre∣sents with them, and often in their Wills and Te∣staments leave their whole Estates to the fore∣mention'd Tomb, where also there are daily Of∣fer'd Sheep , Horses, Camels, Money, and other things. Those that bring the Presents, re∣ceive a handful of Anniseed, in testimony that their Souls shall receive an extraordinary Conso∣lation for the same. The Presents are receiv'd by two sworn Stewards, by them call'd <HI>Nessurtzian,</HI> from the <HI>Arabick</HI> word <HI>Nessurt,</HI> which signifies a Promise or Vow: they sit every day in a House on the left side, near the <HI>Metzid Tschillachane,</HI> where between them stands a round Coffer, co∣ver'd with red Velvet, into which is put the Mo∣ney through a slit at the top. The Camels, Horses and Mules that are Offer'd, are immedi∣ately sold, and converted into Money; but Sheep and Oxen are kill'd and distributed amongst the Poor.</P>
<P>To these Stewards <HI>Schach Ismael</HI> gave the Re∣venue of a large Village call'd <HI>Sultanabeth,</HI> a League from the City <HI>Ardebil,</HI> for their Mainte∣nance; but <HI>Anno</HI> 1618. this Village was demo∣lish'd by <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> upon the approach of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, together with the City <HI>Ardebil.</HI></P>

In this City is a very long Street, being rather a Market-place full of Shops, with all sorts of Commodities, which though it be not so long as that of <HI>Schiras,</HI> yet is much broader, and beautifi'd with Trees that stand ranging on both sides, and are a shade to the Houses. But that which is most ornamental to this City, is their stately <HI>Caravansera,</HI> built <HI>An.</HI> 1610. being able to Lodge very many Strangers, with all accommodation and convenience of Re∣ception. Near this stands a stately Palace, erected by King <HI>Abbas,</HI> which though but indifferent on the out-side, yet magnificent and beautiful with∣in, and indeed one of the best contriv'd Houses that the King hath in his whole Dominions; within whose Walls having pass'd one Garden, you enter into another larger than the former, be∣ing the <HI>Haram</HI> or <HI>Seraglio</HI> for his Women, and surrounded with a Hedge of delicate Fruit-Trees.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Caxem</HI> is none of the biggest, nor the least in this Province, yet the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> always held the same in great esteem, partly be∣cause the People were civil and quie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and in their Dealings just and honest; and party for its Wealth and flourishing Trade in all manner of Silk-Stuffs, but especially the best and fairest Carpets of all <HI>Persia,</HI> made in the Villages be∣longing to the Jurisdiction of this City, none, in all <HI>Persia</HI> comparing with them, except those of <HI>Ispahan.</HI> The Weavers live all together in a little part of the City, inclos'd with a Wall, and all those other Workmen who prepare and make ready the Silk. But the Suburbs are much more pleasant than the City it self, being full of de∣lightful Gardens, and having many fair <HI>Caravan∣sera's,</HI> for the reception and accommodation of Strangers. There is no Water about this City, but what is in Wells, which nevertheless is very wholsom. Moreover, there is little good Water all the way between <HI>Ispahan</HI> and <HI>Casbin,</HI> by reason of the thirsty and hot Earth; but this want is supply'd by the abundance of Snow, which lies thick on the tops of the Mountains all the year.</P>
<P>A days Journey from this City is a Village,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Village <HI>Cen∣cem.</HI></NOTE> call'd <HI>Cencem,</HI> whose adjacent Hills exhale bitu∣minous and sulphureous Vapors, which makes the Air very unwholsom, especially in the Night, when these Vapors chiefly rise; they also make the Summer Heats extream sultry. This Town hath onely one small <HI>Mosque</HI> in it, and that not remarkable for any thing that may require a De∣scription: In the Year 1617 it had a hundred and fifty Families, but the next year following they had been all swept away with a pestilential Distemper, had not the <HI>Spanish</HI> Agent <HI>Garcias de Silva,</HI> coming there by chance in his way to <HI>Hispahan,</HI> given them advice to be Let-blood, which prov'd a present Remedy.</P>

It conterminates in the South, with the Province of <HI>Erack;</HI> in the North, with the <HI>Cas∣pian</HI> Sea; and in the West and North-West, at <HI>Schirwan,</HI> or the Mountains of <HI>Schamachie</HI> and the Plains of <HI>Mocan.</HI></P>
<P>This Province af <HI>Gilan</HI> is divided into twenty Counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Division.</NOTE> in which there are several Towns, Villages, and Hamlets, <HI>viz.

<P>You enter this Province on the South from <HI>Erack,</HI> through a narrow but well known Road, by Writers call'd <HI>Caken,</HI> or <HI>The Straight of Hirca∣nia;</HI> but in the time of <HI>Alexander</HI> it was call'd <HI>Pylae,</HI> and is the same which <HI>Olearius</HI> calls now <HI>The Caspian Gate.</HI></P>
<P>The Way is very narrow through which you come into the Province of <HI>Kilan.</HI></P>
<P>At the Mouth of this Pass are two Streams that coming from the right and left side of <HI>Erack,</HI> con∣joyn their Waves, and gliding along, come at last to a Stone Bridge, which being Vaulted, and ac∣commodated with several Rooms of Entertain∣ment, supplies the place of a <HI>Caravansera;</HI> and pas∣sing thence, divide again and fall by two Mouths into the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea.

<PB N="27" REF="39"/>and steep Passages, incumbred with great Stones, and often so narrow, that a Camel and a Horse can scarce pass one by another; but the right Way that leads to <HI>Kilan</HI> is rather worse, having such Caverns and Precipices, that Travellers are forc'd to walk afoot and lead their Horses over the Mountains, of which, at the same Season, one side is very cold, and the other extream hot; but more Northerly through <HI>Kilan,</HI> are very pleasant Shades, with all manner of Fruit-Trees, and others fit for Timber.</P>
<P>In a Valley near the Stream <HI>Isperuth,</HI> lies a Village call'd <HI>Pyle Rubar</HI> encompass'd with Hills. Though this Village be at the Entrance into <HI>Ki∣lan,</HI> yet the <HI>Persians</HI> will not allow it to belong thereto, but to the Mountains of <HI>Tarum.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Appa∣rel.</NOTE>The Habit of these People in general, is much shorter than of other <HI>Persians,</HI> occasion'd by the wetness of the Place wherein they live, onely herein they differ, that the <HI>Kilaneans</HI> wear Caps of course Linnen, and the <HI>Talians</HI> of black Sheep-skins.

There is no Province in <HI>Persia,</HI> wherein the Wo∣men have so much Respect, and do so little Work, as <HI>Kilan,</HI> where they employ themselves onely in points of Huswifery, as Spinning, Wea∣ving, making <HI>Dubarsita,</HI> or Syrrups (which they sell in great quantities to Houses of publick En∣tertainment;) for in other Places they Till the Ground and Sowe Rice; and whil'st the Man Ploughs the Ground, the Woman in her best Apparel brings the Seed into the Field in Bas∣kets, which he takes and scatters abroad; she Weeds, whil'st he Waters the Land, and as he Reaps the Corn, she binds it up in Sheaves, which being brought home by him, she Threshes, Sifts, and Sells: And here we are to observe, that eve∣ry mans particular Ground lies behind, or about his Dwelling.</P>
<P>This Countrey, by reason of its strong Situa∣tion, seems almost invincible, being surrounded by a continu'd Ledge of Rocky Mountains, through which there are but four Passages; the first whereof runs Northward by the Desart of <HI>Mocan,</HI> through the Province of <HI>Lengercunan;</HI> the second South-West, through <HI>Mazanderan, Fera∣bath,</HI> and by <HI>Astarabath</HI> through <HI>Chorazan.</HI> These Ways or Passages are (as <HI>Oleareus</HI> supposes) the <HI>Portae Caspiae,</HI> or <HI>Caspian Gates,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Stra∣bo, Pliny, Solinus, Ptolomy,</HI> and others of the An∣cients; and they might so be call'd, because they led out of <HI>Persia</HI> to the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and are indeed so narrow, that through some of them two Horses or Camels cannot go abreast, and in others scarce one, as particularly appears by the Descri∣ption of <HI>Pyle Kubar.</HI></P>
<P>Within this Province is reckon'd the City <HI>Derbend</HI> near the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, where there is also a narrow Passage (being the <HI>Iron Gate</HI> before men∣tion'd) out of <HI>Tartary</HI> into <HI>Persia.</HI> Camels go with ease along this Way to <HI>Gilan,</HI> but Men that ride that way (excepting some desperate People) are forc'd to lead their Horses over the Moun∣tains; wherefore a few Men plac'd at these En∣trances, may keep a great Army out of the Coun∣trey. And that the Way over the Mountains might be kept secure, a great Wall was built from that City fifty Leagues in length down to the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and onely one Gate through it; and this in part is manifested by the Name <HI>Derbend,</HI> for <HI>Der</HI> signifies a Gate, and <HI>Bend</HI> a Line. Moreo∣ver (as we hinted before,) whoever takes notice of this City, and the Countrey about it, will cer∣tainly conclude, that <HI>Derbend</HI> is the strongest and safest Door to those that will travel by Land through <HI>Persia;</HI> and that if the same be secur'd, it is impossible for any on that side to come thither: And they are no less safe by Sea, in regard no Ships can approach the Shore, by reason of the many Sands and shallow Water; the <HI>Cossacks</HI> onely now and then with their small Vessels pilfer along the Sea-Coast.</P>

In the middle it is so deep that it cannot be plumm'd with a fifty or sixty Fa∣thom Line. Hundreds of Rivers discharge their Waters into the same; for between <HI>Rescht</HI> and <HI>Schamachie,</HI> being distant about twenty days Jour∣ney from each other, it receives of great and small Streams, above fourscore; the chiefest of them are the <HI>Volga,</HI> anciently call'd <HI>Rha;</HI> the <HI>Araxis</HI> or <HI>Aras,</HI> united with the <HI>Cyrus</HI> or <HI>Cur, Ki∣silosein, Bastro, Acsai,</HI> and <HI>Coisu;</HI> from the North comes the <HI>Jaik;</HI> from the South and East, the <HI>Jems, Nios, Oxus,</HI> and <HI>Orxantes,</HI> by <HI>Curtius</HI> call'd <HI>Tanais.</HI> It may seem a Wonder, that this Sea, which receives the Water of so many Rivers, should have no apparent place for Discharge of the same; and therefore some have affirm'd, that it percolates into the main Ocean through invi∣sible Pipes or Channels, <HI>Olearius</HI> says he was in∣form'd by the <HI>Persians,</HI> that there is a great Mouth between <HI>Tabristan</HI> and <HI>Mazanderan,</HI> not far from <HI>Ferabath,</HI> into which this Sea falling, sinks away under the Mountains; but we insist not thereon. The Water near the Shore is sweet, by reason of the many fresh Streams, which (as we said) fall into it, but in the middle is very salt, and (according to <HI>Petreus</HI>) as black as Ink; but <HI>Olearius</HI> affirms the contrary to this last Point from ocular experience; neither is there any Island re∣plete with Towns and Villages, onely <HI>Ensil</HI> near <HI>Ferabath,</HI> affording good Pasturage for Cattel, hath some few Huts for Herdsmen, Nor are any great Serpents caught in this Sea, as <HI>Curtius,</HI> nor red Fish, as <HI>Pedro Bizarro</HI> relates from <HI>Ambrosius Contarenus,</HI> being without a Head, yet an Ell long; out of whose boyl'd Fat the Inhabitants extrad Oyl, and make Salve for Camels; but the People hereabouts want not the foremen∣tion'd Oyl, for they have great plenty of <HI>Nefta,</HI> being another sort of liquid Matter, which they burn in Lamps, and make use of on other like oc∣casions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Fish <HI>Naca.</HI></NOTE>There is a great Fish call'd <HI>Naca</HI> taken in this Sea, having a short Head and Belly, wide Mouth, and round Tail, three or four Yards thick.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>White-Fish.</HI></NOTE>No less dangerous is the <HI>White-Fish,</HI> of which so many breed here, that the Fishermen dare not go into above four Fathom Water; which <HI>Pom∣ponius Mela</HI> seems to have observ'd, when he saith in his <HI>Geography, This Sea is more dangerous than any other, by reason of the many Monsters that breed therein.</HI> It hath been reported, that in <HI>Kilan,</HI> over against the Mountain <HI>Sahebelan,</HI> where they breed most, they are taken with Hooks, fastned to thick Lines, and Baited with Flesh.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers other sorts of Fish.</NOTE>Nor doth it onely breed Monsters, for (con∣trary to the Opinion of <HI>Contareno</HI> and <HI>Bizarro</HI>) it produces several sorts of excellent Fish, as Sal∣mon, Sturgeon, Carps an Ell long, a sort of Her∣rings, great Breams call'd <HI>Chascham, Scwit</HI> or <HI>Schi∣vit,</HI> and a sort of Barbels a Yard and a half long, but others less, which are tough, and not fit to be eaten.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants there catch another sort of Salmon-Trouts, which they dry in the Smoak, and Dress after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> They lay the smoak'd Fish, wrapt in a Linnen or Cotton Cloth, upon a hot Hearth, and then cover it with Ashes till it be enough, whereby it gaineth a most delicate taste.</P>
<P>This abundance of Fish breeding in the Sea, causes the King of <HI>Persia</HI> to Farm out the Fishing thereof towards the Mouth of the fresh Rivers, which brings him yearly considerable Sums of Money. This Fishing Farm begins in <HI>September,</HI> and lasts to the end of <HI>March;</HI> during which time the Rivers are shut up, to prevent Intruders, that have no right to Fish there, but all the rest of the year not onely the Rivers, but the Sea it self lies free and open to all Persons.</P>
<P>This Sea in the Summer the <HI>Persians, Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Russians</HI> Navigate in sleight and miserable Vessels, with which they dare not Sail but onely before the Wind, nor venture from the sight of the Shore.</P>
<P>There are but few Harbors, and those neither good nor safe; the place between the Island <HI>Tzenzeni</HI> and the main Land, is counted one of the securest, and therefore the <HI>Persians</HI> always An∣chor there in the Night: they also us'd to Ride with their Vessels near <HI>Bacu, Lenkeran,</HI> and <HI>Fera∣bath,</HI> according as the Wind favors them: But the best in all that Sea, is towards the East on the <HI>Tartars</HI> side, and is call'd <HI>Chuaresm</HI> and <HI>Minkisch∣lack,</HI> but by some nam'd <HI>Manguslave.</HI></P>
<P>This Sea (according to <HI>Herodotus, Ptolomy,</HI> and <HI>Aristotle</HI>) is distinct: from all other, being wholly inclos'd within the Land, so that it may justly be call'd a <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> from whence appear the Errors of <HI>Dionysius</HI> the <HI>Alexandrian, Pomponius Mela, Strabo, Pliny, Solinus, Basilius Magnus,</HI> and others, who would make it to mix with the <HI>Scy∣thian</HI> or <HI>Tartarick</HI> Sea; or else a Bay of the Northern Ocean, and not totally surrounded by the Land.</P>

The Houses are built un∣der high Trees, and so shaded with the Boughs, that they are scarce to be seen, insomuch that one may doubt whether <HI>Eskerf</HI> be a City erected in a Wood, or a Grove inhabited like a City. In the middle of the Gardens behind the Houses, stand Chambers, or rather, Galleries, (because they are onely cover'd on the top) which being about a Man's heighth above the Ground, are ascended to by Steps, and serve both for Eating and Sleeping Rooms in Summer, by reason of their coolness, and are in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Balachane,</HI> that is, <HI>A high House:</HI> And this is so common, and the Inhabitants so us'd to repose in open Rooms, that they would incur great incon∣venience by a more close retiredness.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Appa∣rel.</NOTE>All these new Inhabitants of this Countrey wear long Breeches and short Coats, not reach∣ing down to their Knees, with an upper Garment made fast about their Middle with a Girdle; they wear no <HI>Turbants,</HI> onely a little Cap, in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Cork,</HI> made of Leather, and Lin'd with Cloth, sharp on the top, and broad at the bottom; which were invented by King <HI>Abbas.</HI> These kind of Caps are very common, and worn within Doors in stead of <HI>Turbants</HI> by Persons of Quality, but when they go abroad they put on their <HI>Turbants,</HI> yet their Servants carry these after their Masters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Lan∣guage and Government.</NOTE>The Language which is spoken in this Pro∣vince, is the vulgar <HI>Persian.</HI></P>
<P>The supream Command of the whole Province belongs to a Vice-Roy or Lieutenant, who bears the Title of <HI>Chan,</HI> and keeps his Court in <HI>Ferha∣bad.</HI> But in former times this Province was Go∣vern'd by a peculiar King, which paid Tribute to the <HI>Sophy;</HI> but he rebelling, <HI>Xa Abas</HI> sent his Ge∣neral thither to reduce him.</P>
<P>This Province is surrounded with great Woods, cut through by several Brooks, and inclos'd with Mountains overgrown with Trees, insomuch that <HI>Della Valla</HI> affirms, that this Countrey bore so great a resemblance with those of <HI>Europe,</HI> that he saw not the like in all those Parts through which he travell'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>The Soil is very fruitful, and us'd to lie Fallow, through the neglect and idleness of the Inhabi∣tants: The Earth being fat and Morassy, is en∣compass'd by the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> and River <HI>Teggine Rude.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperature of the Air.</NOTE>The temperature of the Air is much like that at
<PB N="33" REF="44"/><HI>Rome, viz.</HI> in the Winter moist, and subject to tempestuous Weather: moreover, they feel the same Heat or Cold there, which is no great won∣der, because both the foremention'd Places lie al∣most in one and the same Northern Latitude, ha∣ving great, and almost continual Winter Rains.</P>
<P>At the entrance on the South out of the Ter∣ritory of <HI>Arack,</HI> into that of <HI>Mazanderan;</HI> lies a very narrow Valley at the foot of several Moun∣tains, which after three Leagues Journey grows somewhat wider, and is wash'd by a little Brook. This Plain, though well cultivated, produces no∣thing but Rice; and the like do most places in this whole Province, being indeed most fit for that Grain, by reason of the abundance of Wa∣ter and moistness of the Soil (for Rice requires moisture,) or else that it is the chiefest, if not one∣ly Grain of the Inhabitants, for they use no other Bread, not setting any esteem upon Wheat or Rye, neither use much Milk, Whit-meat, or But∣ter, because they think them unwholsom; but of Rice, which they boyl sometimes one way, and sometimes another, mingled with Flesh or Fruit, they make several savory Dishes, which they call <HI>Pilao's,</HI> according to their several Palats. This <HI>Pilao</HI> is convenient for Travellers, because it may be made ready in a short time, and keeps good a great while, and withal is a wholsom and palata∣ble Food.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Inhabitants.</NOTE>The Inhabitants are of a sallow Complexion, occasion'd by the Heats of the Climate, and con∣stant eating of Rice, and their Hair and Eye∣brows very black. The Women are very hand∣som Body'd, and have good Features, which they grace with a courteous Behavior, and affability in Discourse; and this is the more pleasing, be∣cause (according to their Custom, in which they differ very much from other <HI>Mahumetans</HI>) they ne∣ver cover their Faces, nor shun the Company of Men. Both Men and Women are hospitable, treating Strangers in their Houses with the highest Civility imaginable, not expecting any Return, yet refuse not any thing Presented to them; for there are no Inns or <HI>Caravansera's</HI> to give public Entertainment, but every House (as we said, is free to receive Strangers; wherefore we may justly say, that there is no Countrey where the Inhabitants are more hospitable and civil; so that <HI>Hircania</HI> (which the Ancients reported to be full of Tygers and other wild Beasts,) if <HI>Mazan∣deran</HI> be compris'd in the same, is one of the most civiliz'd Territories that can be found in all <HI>Asia,</HI> and the Inhabitants thereof have a suitable com∣mendation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Soil.</NOTE>The Land between the City <HI>Ferhabad</HI> and <HI>Es∣kerf</HI> is even and plain, on which grow wild Arti∣chokes, Parsnips, and the like.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns and Villages.</NOTE>You may see here also many Towns and Villa∣ges, as you travel from <HI>Arack</HI> Southward to <HI>Fer∣habad,</HI> particularly a Village call'd <HI>Mynikelle.</HI> Four Leagues from thence lies another call d <HI>Giru;</HI> the Road between both which in the Win∣ter is very bad arid deep, by reason of the con∣tinual wetness of the Ground. A days Journey farther you come to <HI>Tellara Pescet,</HI> a large Hamlet, having on one fide many dispersed Villages, and on the other, a Hilly Countrey. Beyond these appears a great Wood, through which is a broad Way shadow'd by high Trees. This Road is very plashy, because many little Brooks run in it, which in the Winter makes it so deep and rotten, that the Camels, though they have long Legs, often sink up to the Knees. Four Leagues from this Village lies a strong, large, and populous Place, call'd <HI>Saru,</HI> where the King hath a magnificent Pa∣lace, and thereby has gain'd the repute of a City, though consisting chiefly of a sort of Thatch'd Houses, except a few scatter'd Dwellings that are Tyl'd: It is call'd <HI>Saru,</HI> which signifies <HI>Yellow,</HI> from the abundance of Oranges, and other yel∣lowish Fruits that grow about the same. Beyond <HI>Saru</HI> lie several great Plains, which in former Ages were overgrown with Woods, but since that being clear'd and Manur'd, they are become very fertile, and the Ways, which then were very deep are now (the Ground lying open to the Sun) be∣come very hard, and some places of late made into Pav'd Cawseys. These Plains are also in∣habited by several People, most of them <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> sent thither from divers Countreys <HI>An.</HI> 1620. to make several Plantations, especially from <HI>Ar∣menia</HI> and <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P>The Way from <HI>Saru</HI> hath all along the sides, Houses rais'd onely of Boughs and Mud, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Trees which were cut down in the same place by the Inhabitants, to make the Countrey fit for Cultivation.</P>
<P>This Province is divided from the South to the North by, the River <HI>Teggine Rude,</HI> which taking original out of the Mountains more Southward of the <HI>Rice-Valley,</HI> runs through it, as also the City <HI>Ferhabad;</HI> two thousand Paces from which it dis∣charges its Waters into the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> having in the Way receiv'd so many Brooks, Streams, and Rivulets, that from the City <HI>Saru</HI> it is Na∣vigable with flat-bottom'd Boats, made on pur∣pose of the Bodies of great Trees to Row with Oars: Some of them can carry ten or twelve Men, or Goods of the like Burthen. The Towns∣men of <HI>Ferhabad</HI> often go out a Fishing for their Pleasure into the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> with such Boats, and make use of them in the City to go from one place to another.</P>

<P><HI>Erack Ajan</HI> compriseth yet two Kingdoms, <HI>viz. Macran</HI> and <HI>Guadel.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these two <HI>Carmania's,</HI> this Countrey com∣prehends <HI>Mogostan,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wild Carmania</HI> borders (according to <HI>Ptolomy</HI>) in the North, upon <HI>Parthia;</HI> the West verges <HI>Per∣sia;</HI> the South looks upon <HI>Great Carmania;</HI> and in the East it lies terminated by <HI>Aria.</HI></P>
<P>The old <HI>Wild Carmania</HI> compriseth the well known Kingdoms of <HI>Lara</HI> and <HI>Oessa,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>The Kingdom of Monbareca</HI> or <HI>Mombareck,</HI> from the Name of the Governor, besides the Countreys of <HI>Mogosthan.</HI></P>
<P>The Countreys which lie to the Northward from the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> at the side of <HI>Persia,</HI> were formerly possess'd by one <HI>Mombareck,</HI> Son to a mighty <HI>Arabian,</HI> which <HI>Texeira</HI> places hard by <HI>Bagdad</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> where there are many good Ci∣ties, as <HI>Magdon, Oexa,</HI> and <HI>Ooreca,</HI> surrounded with rich Land, yet lying waste for fear of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who have many Garrisons in this <HI>Mombareck</HI>'s Countrey, to guard those which pay him Tri∣bute.</P>
<P>The greater <HI>Carmania</HI> borders in the North up∣on <HI>Wild Carmania,</HI> in the East faces <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> the West looks upon a part of <HI>Persia</HI> and a part of the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf, and the South is limited by the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Bagrada,</HI> so call'd by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> and plac'd in <HI>Wild Carmania,</HI> is now nam'd <HI>Bintmir,</HI> or (as others) <HI>Budmir;</HI> by <HI>Niger, Biserti;</HI> and in the <HI>Arabick,</HI> as <HI>Thevet</HI> affirms, <HI>Biquelmick.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey, <HI>Davity</HI> tells, was possess'd by <HI>Zizaerian Arabians</HI> that formerly dwelt in <HI>Bassora. Wild Carmania,</HI> as <HI>Maginus</HI> writes, hath not one City; nor indeed doth <HI>Ptolomy</HI> mention any therein.</P>
<P><HI>Great Carmania</HI> boasts the River <HI>Bassiri,</HI> and the Cape <HI>Jasquette</HI> or <HI>Jasques,</HI> about twenty five or twenty six Leagues from <HI>Ormus,</HI> near the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulf, opposite to <HI>Arabia Felix: Ortelius</HI> says <HI>Pto∣lomy</HI> call'd it <HI>The Cape of Ormus.</HI> Up into the Countrey lie the Towns <HI>Sirgian, Tesirco, Serent,</HI> and <HI>Kirman</HI> or <HI>Kirmon,</HI> the chief City of the Region.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Olearius, Kirman</HI> is a great Coun∣trey, and lying between <HI>Farsi</HI> and <HI>Sagistan,</HI> exten∣ding Northerly to the Sea and the Isle of <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Kirman,</HI> Northerly, lies a great Desart; but Southward, towards the Sea, <HI>Kirman</HI> hath much till'd Land, and many fine Towns, the Names whereof are <HI>Bersir, Bermasir, Bem, Chabis, Tzirefft,</HI> and <HI>Gamron,</HI> which lying near the Sea, is often call'd <HI>Bender</HI> or <HI>Bander Gamron,</HI> that is, <HI>The Haven of Camron,</HI> for <HI>Bender</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue signifies a Haven.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Gamron,</HI> or <HI>Bender Gamron,</HI> by <HI>Della Valle</HI> call'd <HI>Cambru,</HI> lies in 27 Degrees of Northern Latitude, West-South-West about three Leagues from the Isle of <HI>Ormus,</HI> being formerly a little Village, inhabited by Fishermen, who came thither for its convenient Situation near the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Gulf. But since the conquering of the fa∣mous Isle of <HI>Ormus,</HI> and driving the <HI>Portuguese</HI> from thence, <HI>Gamron</HI> being frequented by the <HI>Eng∣lish, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> Vessels, grew to a hand∣som Town, and is enlarg'd daily by the Merchants and Travellers which come thither in <HI>November,</HI> (for then the heat of the Weather is over), either
<PB N="35" REF="45"/>from the Court at <HI>Ispahan,</HI> or other adjacent Ci∣ties.

The Streets are very crooked, narrow and dirty. The chiefest Houses, as those of the <HI>Sultans,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> Store-houses, stand on the Shore, against which the Sea oftentimes beats with great violence; yet they are very conve∣nient to lade and unlade Goods. The Ships Ride about a Cannon shot from the Land, in five or six Fathom Water. There are also many little Huts of Boughs and Date-tree Leaves, which are much us'd here; and because there are no hard Stones hereabouts, and the Timber extraordinary scarce; many stately Houses have been pull'd down on the Isle, and the Materials thereof car∣ry'd away to build Houses on the Main.</P>
<P>On the East side of the Countrey stands a Fort, built after the ancient manner with Towers. Upon the Shore also, about a Gun-shot from the Water, is another Fort, built of Free-stone, sur∣rounded with a dry Trench, a low Vaumure, and on the West side a Stone Redoubt, of sufficient Strength against any sudden Onset.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Village <HI>Cambru.</HI></NOTE>The great Village <HI>Cambru</HI> (according to <HI>Della Valle</HI>) stands upon the Sea-shore in 27 Degrees of Northern Latitude.

The Walls of the Houses are of Lime or Clay, and may rather be call'd Barns than Houses, being nothing but large and inclosed places, cover'd with a Roof for a shelter in bad Weather, and to keep off the heat of the Sun, which in these Countreys is very pow∣erful.</P>
<P>Here is a general Toleration of Religion: for besides the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> there are abundance of <HI>Jews, Banians</HI> from <HI>India,</HI> and many other People of divers Beliefs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort <HI>Cambru.</HI></NOTE>There is a Fortress in a low Tract of Land near the Sea; and not far from it the Fort of <HI>Cambru,</HI> which being square, is encompass'd with a double Wall; the first hath no Redoubts nor Flankers, but the outmost hath some Sconces and Curteyns, sufficient to bear Musquet-shot: The inner Wall is somewhat higher, and hath several little round Turrets, built at certain distances one from ano∣ther; between each of which lies a great Stone, which in time of need may be thrown down on the Enemy: Over the Gate appears a square place like a Gallery full of Port-holes, through which the Soldiers with Musquets defend the Pas∣sage to the Gate: Outermost is abroad and deep Moat, fortifi'd with Half-moons and Breast-works, but so weak, that they may be batter'd down with a small Field-piece.</P>
<P>On the Shore of <HI>Cambru</HI> lie abundance of Sea-Cockles, by which the Coast may easily be known.</P>
<P>The Ferry from <HI>Cambru</HI> to <HI>Ormus</HI> is not above a days Sailing, in Vessels as big as Sloops, by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Cuibet.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> in former times had another Fort near the Shore, which the <HI>Persians</HI> after their Con∣quest pull'd down; but they built the foremen∣tion'd Fort in stead thereof farther up in the Coun∣trey, and afterwards in the Year 1623. in <HI>January,</HI> they rais'd another on the Shore, in the same place where that belonging to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> stood, find∣ing that so far up into the Countrey unable to de∣fend the Ships and Haven, which is much fre∣quented from several Places in <HI>Persia, India</HI> and <HI>Arabia.</HI> There is also a Governor of the Town, and another of the Fort, and a Judge call'd <HI>Cadhi.</HI></P>
<P>Once a year commonly there happens an Earth∣quake in <HI>Cambru,</HI> which often overturns several Houses.</P>
<P>In the Way from <HI>Schiras</HI> to the Haven of <HI>Cam∣bru,</HI> whither the <HI>English</HI> come yearly with the <HI>Ca∣ravan</HI> to ship their Silks, are the following Places, <HI>viz.</HI> the Burrough of <HI>Passa,</HI> the Plain of <HI>Gigangli,</HI> the Village <HI>Haian Havask,</HI> the <HI>Caravansera</HI> of <HI>Ma∣mui,</HI> the City <HI>Passa, Tambustan</HI> or <HI>Temerista,</HI> the barren place between the Mountains <HI>Seciah,</HI> that is, <HI>The three Pits,</HI> because of certain Pits there, and beyond that the Village <HI>Zirevan;</HI> some Leagues from which the Way parts into two, the one runs to the City <HI>Darabghierd,</HI> and the other to <HI>Dechair,</HI> a Village, a days Journey beyond this parting of the Road. The many Dates and other Trees which grow in <HI>Darebghierd,</HI> make it seem a very pleasant Place, which extending a great way, hath abundance of Inhabitants. There is nothing re∣markable in the same but a Brook, which running through the Market makes a standing Pool in the middle: However, it is very eminent for its An∣tiquity and Name, which it hath preserv'd to this day, <HI>viz.</HI> from the ancient <HI>Persian</HI> King <HI>Darius,</HI> who built it, and call'd it <HI>Darab,</HI> according to the Name which this Place bears, <HI>viz. Darabghierd,</HI> or <HI>Darabkera,</HI> that is, <HI>Darius's City.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Darabghierd</HI> we see the Villages <HI>De∣chair,</HI> and beyond that the Wilderness of <HI>Mog∣hokiel.</HI></P>

In the middle of this Court stands a great Palm-Tree, by whose Foot runs another Brook, replenish'd with all sorts of Fish for the Service of the Court.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meir Aba<HI>'s Tomb.</HI></NOTE> On one side of the <HI>Mosque</HI> is <HI>Meir Abas</HI>'s Tomb, cover'd with sleight <HI>Turkish</HI> Linnen.

<PB N="36" REF="46"/>which were brought from <HI>Kierrila,</HI> and the famous <HI>Hossein</HI>'s Tomb, on which were Imprinted in <HI>Ara∣bick</HI> Letters the name of <HI>GOD,</HI> and some other pious words, as <HI>Elhemdu lillah,</HI> that is, <HI>God be praised.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond this Tomb you come between narrow Mountains, which formerly serv'd for the Boun∣daries between the two Provinces of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Lar,</HI> when <HI>Lar</HI> was a peculiar Dukedom, and not subject to the <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P>Somewhat farther you come to the Village <HI>Furg;</HI> and beyond it to several Heaps of Rubbish, being the Ruines of an ancient Structure, by the Vulgar call'd <HI>The Mountain of the King of Behmen,</HI> who (as they report) Reign'd a considerable time in <HI>Persia,</HI> before <HI>Darius</HI> was conquer'd by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great.</P>
<P>Next you approach the Village <HI>Tascui,</HI> and <HI>Seid Geuder</HI> in the County of <HI>Tarom;</HI> the salt Water of <HI>Absicur,</HI> the Village <HI>Pelengon,</HI> and the <HI>Tenghi Ce∣barrud,</HI> or <HI>Narrow Gate;</HI> beyond which a Brook glides gently into a Moat; near which Travellers commonly resting themselves, cut their Names and Verses on the Rocks, which shadow this Brook from the heat of the Sun all the day.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Metro∣polis.</NOTE>The Metropolis of <HI>Tagestan,</HI> call'd <HI>Saru,</HI> lies partly upon, and partly between the Mountains, which are Rocky, and at a distance appear as if they were cover'd with Mussle-shells, for there is scarce any piece, to the bigness of a Mans Hand, but what hath five or more Shells sticking upon it. The Stones of the Rock are as hard as a Pebble. Beyond these craggy Mountains are good Pastures for Cattel. Behind <HI>Tarcu</HI> lies the Castle <HI>Suchur.</HI> In the City, which hath no Walls, are about a thousand Houses, built after the <HI>Persian</HI> manner, though somewhat sleighter. Out of the Rocks spring several Brooks, which with a pleasant mur∣muring noise glide down the Mountains through the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tagestans</HI> of <HI>Tarcu,</HI> and those of <HI>Boinack,</HI> that dwell towards the North, are call'd <HI>Caitack.</HI> Westward beyond <HI>Tarcu</HI> is another sort nam'd <HI>Cu∣muck</HI> and <HI>Casucumuck,</HI> who are under the Jurisdi∣ction of peculiar Lords.

<P>The Natives maintain themselves by breeding of Cattel, which the Women take care of, whil'st their Husbands Ride abroad to steal whatever comes to hand, not sparing Men, Women, or Chil∣dren; for they account it no Sin to sell their nearest Relations, Brothers or Sisters, to the <HI>Turks.</HI> Those that dwell near the Rivers live by Fishing, espe∣cially by catching of Sturgeon, which they take with strong Harping-Irons, and the Pole to which the Line is fastned fix'd in the Ground.</P>
<P>The Diet of the Grandees or <HI>Chans,</HI> is com∣monly Mutton cut into small Slices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man of Eating and Drinking.</NOTE> and roasted on a woodden Spit; as also Sturgeon cut in little Pieces, which being boyl'd with Salt, they eat it with Butter and Vinegar. They use no Knives, but pull their Meat in pieces with their Fingers. When any one of them lays down a Bone, he that sits next to him taking it up, picks it much cleaner, and sometimes it is taken up by three or four after the same manner. Their Drinking-Cups are long Cows Horns, out of which they Drink a Liquor made of Barley, and call'd <HI>Brega,</HI> which in colour is like Mead. They are very boisterous in their Cups.

<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Tarcu</HI> are wild and valiant, but the Women are very courteous; they are all <HI>Ma∣humetans,</HI> and suffer themselves to be Circumcis'd yet are great Zealots, and some of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Wo∣men are privately inclin'd to the <HI>Christian</HI> Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Village <HI>Andre</HI> have amongst other Nuptial Ceremonies these follow∣ing, <HI>viz.</HI> Every Guest brings an Arrow with him, which he shoots either into the upper part of the Wall, or the Roof of the House, where they stick till they rot or fall down of themselves: what the signification hereof is none knows. They are a valiant and undaunted People, caring neither for the King of <HI>Persia</HI> nor the Great Duke of <HI>Muscovia,</HI> but boast themselves <HI>Tagestans,</HI> and consequently subject to none but God: which their audaciousness depends chiefly on the inac∣cessible Mountains, whither they retire when any stronger Enemy falls into their Countrey. The Merchants that travel through their Dominions are forc'd to pay great Customs, and yet if they are not strong enough to defend themselves, are sure to be Robb'd; and therefore they always go with the Caravans in great Companies.</P>
<P>This Countrey is under the Subjection of seve∣ral Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> by one general Name call'd <HI>Myrsa;</HI> but many Cities are Govern'd by a peculiar Lord; yet they have a supream Commander nam'd <HI>Schemchi,</HI> and by others <HI>Schafcal,</HI> who is as a King, and chosen by the throwing of an Apple, <HI>viz.</HI> at the Election all the <HI>Myrsa's</HI> or Princes meet together, and standing in a Ring, their Priest throws a Gilded Apple amongst them, and who∣ever he hits therewith is immediately chosen <HI>Schemchal,</HI> who though he hath great Honor and Respect, yet he finds but litte Faith and Obedi∣ence from them, and therefore cannot be said to Govern with arbitrary Power: He keeps his Court in a Village nam'd <HI>Andre,</HI> situate on a Hill near the River <HI>Coisu:</HI> His Habit is a Silk Coat of green <HI>Darai,</HI> and over it a black Furr Mantle: and when he Rides out he is commonly Arm'd with a Scimiter, Bowe and Arrows.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Tarcu</HI> lies a wild and brambly Coun∣trey.</P>
<P>Five Leagues from <HI>Tarcu</HI> lies the Stream <HI>Coisu,</HI> which abounding with Fish, takes its original from Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> and runs very swift, the Water muddy, of a reasonable breadth, and ge∣nerally eighteen or twenty Foot deep, which <HI>Ole∣arius</HI> supposes to be the <HI>Albanus</HI> of the Ancients, which (according to <HI>Pliny</HI>) falls into the River <HI>Cassia.</HI> In this Water breeds abundance of Stur∣geon, and another sort of Fish not much unlike it.</P>
<P>Two Leagues and a half from <HI>Coisu</HI> runs a Brook nam'd <HI>Acsai,</HI> which is not above twenty five Yards broad. Some take this <HI>Acsai</HI> to be onely a Branch of <HI>Coisu,</HI> which unites with the same again not far from the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI> If any Stran∣gers are desirous to Ferry over this River with their Goods, they are forc'd either to pay a great Sum of Money to the Inhabitants, or else they take away their Goods.</P>
<P>Beyond <HI>Acsai</HI> is a barren Heath seven Leagues long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> half a days Journey beyond which runs the River <HI>Bustro,</HI> which is also one of the chiefest, and almost as deep as the <HI>Coisu;</HI> the Water thereof is muddy, but runs not so swift as the foremention'd; it serves for a Boundary between <HI>Circassia</HI> and <HI>Ta∣gestan:</HI> Northward about two Leagues from the <HI>Caspian</HI> Shore it divides it self into two Branches, one of which (now call'd <HI>Temenki,</HI> but formerly, and by some to this day, <HI>Terk</HI>) is about thirty Yards broad, and hath given the City by which it glides, the Denomination of <HI>Terki,</HI> which is the last Town in those Parts under the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Musco∣vy;</HI> the other, beyond this, and of the same big∣ness, bears the Name of <HI>Kisilar,</HI> because it carries along in its Sand a kind of Gold-dust; and lying somewhat higher than the former, is

<P>All these Brooks come Out betwixt the North and the West, and the <HI>Kisilar</HI> is the last in these Parts; but fifty six Leagues farther is the <HI>Volga,</HI> which springs in the North. <HI>Olearius</HI> (according to <HI>Ptolomy</HI>) will have the <HI>Acsai</HI> to be the <HI>Caesius,</HI> the <HI>Bustro</HI> to be the <HI>Gerras,</HI> the <HI>Timeki</HI> or <HI>Terk</HI> to be the <HI>Alonia,</HI> and the <HI>Kisilar</HI> to be the <HI>Adonta:</HI> for between the River <HI>Albanus</HI> or <HI>Coisu</HI> and the <HI>Volga</HI> or <HI>Rha,</HI> no other Rivers are to be found.</P>

<P>THe Kingdom of <HI>Amadan</HI> or <HI>Hamadan,</HI> is by <HI>Texeira</HI> call'd <HI>Amedon,</HI> as also the chief City thereof, which lying between <HI>Cas∣bin</HI> and <HI>Curdistan,</HI> extends thirty Leagues, and boasts fifteen Towns, the Inhabitants whereof are all Merchants.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that the City of <HI>Amadan</HI> lies in the Way which leads from <HI>Bagdad</HI> or <HI>Ba∣bylon</HI> to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and is large and populous, and much frequented by Strangers, though the Buil∣dings are very mean, rather like those in an ordi∣nary Village; yet behind these Houses are fair Gardens full of Fruit-trees, so also are the Streets, Markets, and other publick Places, which are also well furnish'd with all manner of Provision at reasonable Rates: All the Streets where the Shops are (by them call'd <HI>Bazars</HI>) are Arch'd and Pillar'd like <HI>Piazza's.</HI> It is exceeding cold here, for you not onely see Ice in the Streets, but it of∣ten Freezes any liquid thing in the Chambers though there is a constant Fire kept.</P>
<P>This City is the Residence of a <HI>Chan,</HI> who hath many Towns and Villages under his Jurisdiction, as also a <HI>Daroga</HI> or Deputy.</P>
<P>Thus much of every Province of the King∣dom of <HI>Persia</HI> in particular; next we will give you an Account of what concerns <HI>Persia</HI> and all the Provinces in general, and also of such Remarks of some Provinces in particular, as shall be requisite to be spoken of, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Air, Property of the Soil, Plants, Beasts, Customs, Food, Liquors, Language, Learning, Funerals, Arms, Religions, Government, and what else is necessary to be describ'd.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Temperature of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>THe Air of these Countreys is for the most part very healthful and temperate, with very little Rain, especially towards the South, and in some places (as in <HI>Gamaron</HI> near the Sea-Coast) not once in three years.</P>
<P>By reason of the vast Extent of <HI>Persia, viz.</HI> from the twenty fifth Degree of the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> to the thirty seventh Degree Northward, and likewise for the rough rocky Mountains of <HI>Taurus,</HI> which run through the middle of the Coun∣trey, and spread out with several Arms, the Air is not every where alike temper'd, but different in many Provinces. Such as dwell Southward from the Mountains feel the Heat exceedingly in the Summer, but those to the Northward have the Seasons more temperate; wherefore the <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Kings us'd formerly at Set-times in the Year, for their Pleasure and Health sake, to remove their Courts to such Provinces, where they judg'd the Weather would best agree with them: for in the Summer they kept their Courts at <HI>Ecbatane,</HI> now call'd <HI>Thus,</HI> where because of the Mountains in the South-West, it is very cool, and in the Winter at <HI>Susa,</HI> now <HI>Susistan;</HI> which City lies next to the Northern Mountains, on which the Sun-beams reflecting, make the same a warm and delightful Place, as appears by the Name, for <HI>Susa</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue signifies a <HI>Lilly.</HI> In <HI>September</HI> and <HI>March</HI> they remov'd to <HI>Persepolis</HI> and <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> to this day make use of this convenience of the Air, for <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> in the Winter resided in the Province of <HI>Mazanderan</HI> at <HI>Ferabath; Schach Sefi</HI> (according to the Custom of the <HI>Persian</HI> Kings) often going on Progress, some∣times kept his Court in <HI>Tabris,</HI> otherwhile in <HI>Ar∣debil</HI> or <HI>Casbin:</HI> But the present Seat of the Kings being in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> is no inconvenient Place either in Winter or Summer, because it is situate on a Plain three Leagues from the Mountains, and en∣joys commonly a very temperate Air.</P>
<P>All Strangers in their travelling through <HI>Per∣sia</HI> are sensible of this alteration of the Air in se∣veral places, not without great prejudice to their Health, being forc'd by reason of the excessive Heat to travel in the Night, and rest in the Day, especially between the Mountains, where the Passage goes Southward. But in all parts of <HI>Per∣sia</HI> it is very cold in Winter, and sometimes tra∣velling Eastward with a Northerly Wind it is so exceeding cold, that the Travellers lighting from their Horses in the Morning, are so benumm'd that they can hardly stand.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> says, that the Heat in <HI>Persia</HI> is not very great, yet the Beams of the Sun in the Plains are much hotter than in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Inhabitants in the Summer go Cloth'd in a thin Sute of Callico, in which they walk and do all their Business. Neither is the Cold troublesom to them, partly because it is not very great, notwithstanding it Snows much there, and partly because it lasts but <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Di∣stempers in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE>By reason of this difference in the Air, there are several Places in <HI>Persia</HI> less healthful than others, and the Inhabitants subject to all manner of Di∣stempers, and especially in <HI>Schirman</HI> and <HI>Kilan,</HI> where Fevers and Agues much afflict them. The Air at <HI>Tabris</HI> is accounted the most healthful in all <HI>Persia,</HI> for the Inhabitants thereof are never sensi∣ble of any such Diseases; nay, they affirm, that if any so troubled come thither, they immediately recover; from whence (as the Inhabitants say) the City <HI>Tabris</HI> or <HI>Tebris,</HI> after the <HI>Kilan</HI> pronuncia∣tion, hath receiv'd its Name; for a Feaver is by them call'd <HI>Teb,</HI> and <HI>Ris</HI> signifies <HI>To poure out.</HI> But besides Agues and Feavers there are many other Distempers which rage amongst them, as the Bloody-flux and Plague, though not so often and vehement as in <HI>Europe;</HI> also <HI>Morbus Gallicus,</HI> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Schemetcaschi,</HI> that is, <HI>The Casehanian Pox,</HI> because it is most there.</P>
<P>In <HI>Kilan</HI> the Dropsie is very common, yet few

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persians</HI> live long.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> generally attain to a great Age, many of them living above a hundred years; and at that time when <HI>Olearius</HI> was in <HI>Persia,</HI> the Go∣vernor was above a hundred and forty years old. They commonly suffice themselves with a little, and not too high Food, and live for the most part very temperate.</P>

<HEAD>The Soil.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>AS to what concerns the Soil in this great circumference of Land, it is of a different Nature: for in some places it is exceed∣ing fruitful, by reason of the many Rivers which water the same, especially on the side towards the <HI>Caspian Sea;</HI> the rest is subject to great Drought, and hath many Wildernesses and craggy Moun∣tains. But to speak in general, most of these Pro∣vinces have plenty of several sorts of Grain, and excellent Fruits, as well of those that grow natu∣rally them, as transplanted from <HI>Europe</HI> and elsewhere.</P>
<P>The Soil in <HI>Persia,</HI> specially so call'd, is very dry and stonie, and therefore requires much Ma∣nuring to fatten it, by which, and the Water con∣vey'd in Pipes, the Fields are fertiliz'd, and pro∣duce several sorts of Corn and Fruit in great a∣bundance.</P>
<P>About the Village <HI>Becktahab,</HI> a League from <HI>Ispahan,</HI> the Land is barren and white, which <HI>Della Valle</HI> ascribes to the Salt with which it is mix'd.</P>
<P>The Champain, except that of <HI>Kilan, Olearius</HI> reporteth to be mix'd with red Gravel, and over∣grown with Brambles and Thorns, which the In∣habitants, wanting Wood, use for Fewel. But in the low Grounds, where the most Villages are built, it is green and fertile, for the Inhabitants convey the Brooks, which are not above four or five Foot broad, and spring out of the Mountains, about and through all their Lands and Gardens, which they water therewith: for (as we said be∣fore) there is little Rain falls in <HI>Persia.</HI> Their Fields are generally ten or twelve Rods in the square, which being surrounded with Water, and inclos'd with Banks about a Foot high, they (stop∣ping their Sluces, drown the same when they please, and can let the Water out of one Trench into another; nay, oftentimes when occasion re∣quires, they let their Lands lie under Water in the Night, and in the day-time drain it off again to be dry'd by the Heat of the Sun. Every <HI>Chile</HI> of Land affords ten Truss of Hay.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Plants.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants and Grain.</NOTE>THe Grain which the <HI>Persians</HI> commonly Sowe, are for the most part Rice, some Wheat, Barley, Rye, and Oats, though of no great esteem; they have also <HI>French</HI> Wheat, Tares, and Pease, which are of two sorts; the best they call <HI>Nagud,</HI> and the worst <HI>Culul;</HI> and likewise whole Fields of <HI>Ricinus,</HI> by the <HI>Arabians</HI> call'd <HI>Kicaion, Santjone, Alcaroa, and Kerva;</HI> by the <HI>Persians, Cuntzut;</HI> by the <HI>Italians, Gira Sole;</HI> and with us, <HI>The Sun-Flower;</HI> which in those Coun∣treys continues many years, but with us dies eve∣ry Winter. Out of the Seed they press a sweet and delicate Oyl call'd <HI>Schirbache,</HI> which the <HI>Per∣sians</HI> poure on certain Meats: The Rusticks eat
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>the Seed whole, mix'd with Currans in stead of Sweet-meats.</P>
<P>Cotton, by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Pambeh;</HI> by the <HI>Indians, Algodon;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotton a∣bounds in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE> and by the <HI>Arabians</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Gotne Mesegiar,</HI> is Planted in most Provinces in great abundance, and grows on a Sprig of a Yard long, having Leaves like those of the Vine, but much bigger: On the top of the Stalk grows a Cod about the bigness of a great Walnut, which when ripe, opens in three or four places, through which the Cotton appearing, is gather'd, and much thereof made into Cloth, and the rest sold in Bags. There are several Villages which do nothing else but plant and sell Cotton, which most of all grows in <HI>Armenia, Iran, Nachzuan, Ca∣rabach, Adirbeitzan,</HI> and <HI>Chorazan.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Kilan,</HI> because there grows no Cotton, they Sowe much Line-seed, which they Spin into Thred and make Linnen thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plant <HI>Gontscheh.</HI></NOTE>There is also a sort of Grass, in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Gontscheh,</HI> which being Sow'n, grows a Yard and a half high, and having Leaves like Clover, bears blue Flowers, and being twice Mow'd in eight Weeks, grows up again six years one after another without new Manu∣ring; but in the seventh Year the Land must be turn'd up and Sow'd afresh. This requires also as much Moisture as that of Rice or Wheat. Of this Grain they make Hay for Great Mens Horses, as their best Food; but in some places where it is warm and moist, especially in <HI>Muscur</HI> near the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> where there is no want of Grass either in Summer or Winter, they have no occasion to make such Hay.</P>
<P>Here also are whole Fields of <HI>Faenum Graecum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fenugreek.</NOTE> or <HI>Fenugreek,</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Schem∣bebile:</HI> It is excellent Fodder for Oxen, Cows, and Buffalo's, which are fatned therewith. The <HI>Persians</HI> say, that if Butter lose its taste, and be∣come rank, being melted with the Seed of this Plant, and a piece or two of Onion put therein, it recovers its former rellish.</P>
<P>By reason of the Heat in <HI>Persia,</HI> where it is more Summer than Winter, and in the Summer much constant and Sun-shiny Weather, there are many excellent Garden Fruits, not onely for the Kitchin, but to delight the Palate, as also all man∣ner of Herbs which we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> and among others, great and delicate Colliflowers.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Tarum</HI> grow Onyons of three pound weight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sorts of Melons.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> esteeming Melons, Plant them in great abundance, and being very delicate, eat them before Meals. There are several sorts of Melons, <HI>viz.</HI> Summer and Winter; the first call'd <HI>Kermeck</HI> (from <HI>Kerm,</HI> that is, <HI>Warm,</HI>) are the sweetest, and ripen in <HI>July;</HI> the Harvest Melons, call'd <HI>Charbusei Pasi,</HI> are ripe in <HI>September,</HI> and weighing from thirty to fifty pound, not onely keep good all Winter, but the whole Year, if hung up between green Canes or Reeds, where they are well preserv'd till they have new ones, and are not known from them but by the softness of the Rind. After the same manner they keep Grapes and other Fruits a whole year, so that they have them fresh as if from the Trees in the midst of Winter. There is yet another sort of Melons call'd <HI>Schammame,</HI> about the bigness of an <HI>Orange,</HI> with red, yellow, and green Spots, between which the Rind glitters exceedingly; and though they smell very sweet, yet taste unpleasantly, and there∣fore they are onely carry'd in the Hand for their curious colour and smell, which hath given it the <HI>Arabian.</HI> Name of <HI>Schammame.</HI> There is also a sort call'd <HI>Tochmesksems,</HI> being half <HI>Persian</HI> and half <HI>Arabian,</HI> and signifies <HI>Grain,</HI> or <HI>Seed of the Sun,</HI> which is of an excellent scent and taste. There are likewise Water-Melons nam'd <HI>Hindu∣duane,</HI> from their original out of <HI>India;</HI> as also many sorts of <HI>Calabashes,</HI> among which one call'd <HI>Cabach</HI> is bigger than a Mans Head, with a long Neck and round Knob on the top: The outermost Rind of the ripe ones areas hard as the Bark of a Tree, and tough as Leather: The Pulp dry'd, affords nothing but the Seed, which taken out, they use the Shells in stead of Bowls or Cups, to put Water or Drink in.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fruit <HI>Badinstan.</HI></NOTE>There is another sort of Fruit, not known to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> call'd <HI>Badinstan,</HI> in bigness, form, and manner of growing, like our lesser Melons; the Fruit is commonly grey, except at the end of the Stalk, where it is of a Violet colour; the Seed is round and long, and by reason of the bitterness not eaten raw, but being boyl'd or fry'd with But∣ter, is a pleasant Dish.</P>
<P>Many Vines grow also in <HI>Persia,</HI> and in all the Provinces thereof, which bear large and sweet Grapes, of which <HI>Texeira</HI> says the Inhabitants make excellent Wine, in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language call'd <HI>Xarao</HI> or <HI>Charab:</HI> But the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> are forbidden either to make or drink it. The <HI>Persians</HI> of the Lees of this Wine compose a Syrrup,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persian</HI> Composition <HI>Duschab.</HI></NOTE> by them call'd <HI>Duschab,</HI> after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> They boyl the Lees a sixth part away, till it comes to a thick Oyl, which being mix'd with Water and Vinegar, makes an excellent Liquor; and some∣times they boyl their <HI>Duschab</HI> so thick, that it may be cut with a Knife, which Travellers commonly carrying with them, and putting the same in Wa∣ter to dissolve, Drink. Moreover, the <HI>Persians</HI> of∣ten put this <HI>Duschab</HI> in their Wine, especially those of <HI>Kileck,</HI> because their Wine there is not so sweet as that in the Southern Provinces.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tabris</HI> they make an excellent Dish of <HI>Dus∣chab,</HI> and call it <HI>Helwa,</HI> after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> They take bruis'd Almonds, Wheat Flowre, and Kernels of great Walnuts, all which being put in∣to long Bags with the <HI>Duschab,</HI> is pounded toge∣ther, and dry'd till it become so hard that they must chop it in pieces. Of this Mixture they also make a sort of long Puddings, which they call <HI>Sutzuch.</HI></P>
<P>Here are are several sorts of Grapes, but the sweetest and best are at <HI>Sciras</HI> and <HI>Tabris,</HI> where they are call'd <HI>Tabersel,</HI> which though they may be found in several other Places, yet not in so great abundance; they are long, without Kernels, and keep good a whole Winter. <HI>Keseki</HI> is ano∣ther sort of Grapes, yellow, and exceeding sweet, growing most in <HI>Tarum, Tabris,</HI> and <HI>Ordebath,</HI> but attended with this evil Quality, that whoever eats of them too freely, is sure to be tormented with the Bloody-flux.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Currans <HI>Kismisch.</HI></NOTE>There are also Currans without Stones call'd <HI>Kischmisch,</HI> which are long, green, and bigger than those brought into <HI>Europe,</HI> and grow chiefly about the Village <HI>Bawanat</HI> near <HI>Herat;</HI> those both new gather'd and dry'd give an excellent taste to the <HI>Pilao</HI> and other Meats, wherewith they may be mix'd. Besides these there are two sorts more which are not in <HI>Europe,</HI> the one call'd <HI>Hallage,</HI> which bears Grapes an Inch and a half long, and an Inch thick, brown of colour, and having a hard Pulp, without much Juice or Kernels; these may
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>be kept fresh and good till the ensuing Year pro∣duces others. The second sort is nam'd <HI>Encur Aali Deresi,</HI> the Bunches whereof are extraordi∣nary big, and half a Yard long, each Grape as big as our Pear-plumb, brown of colour, very juicy, but of short continuance, therefore are eaten as they are pull'd from the Trees; they grow in no place but <HI>Iran,</HI> between <HI>Ordebath</HI> and <HI>Chodaferum:</HI> why they are call'd <HI>Encur Aali Deresi</HI> the <HI>Persians</HI> give us this Account, <HI>viz.</HI> That some Ages since in the Winter, their great Saint <HI>Aali</HI> coming to the foremention'd place, met with a Vine-Plan∣ter, whom he ask'd for some Grapes; but he tel∣ling him the impossibility thereof at that time of the year, was commanded by <HI>Aaly</HI> to go into the next Vineyard, where he should find enough; the Man giving credit to those words of <HI>Aaly,</HI> went immediately thither, and saw the Vines hang sull of the best and biggest Grapes that ever his Eyes beheld; from whence (as they say) the Grapes before mention'd grew and were call'd <HI>Encur Aaly Deresi,</HI> that is, <HI>The Grapes in Aaly's nar∣row Valley.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit-Trees and Fruit of several kinds.</NOTE><HI>Persia</HI> hath also all manner of Fruit-trees which grow in <HI>Europe,</HI> besides many other of their own, among which a kind of Pear at <HI>Ordebath</HI> call'd <HI>Melletzo,</HI> in colour and outward shape like a Cit∣tron, sweet of smell, and very juicy.</P>
<P>Granates, Almonds, Dates, and Figs, grow also in several places, especially in the <HI>Kilanean</HI> Wilderness and Mountains. The wild Granates are all sowre, but the Kernels of them dry'd (in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Nardan,</HI> from <HI>Nar</HI> a Pomegranate) are carry'd to be sold in remote Provinces, where they use them to colour their Meat black, and make it tartish, by laying them to soke in Water, and squeezing the Juice tho∣row a Cloth. Many also boyl the Juice out of them when green, and poure the Liquor over Rice, to give it a sharp rellish.</P>
<P>There are also whole Gardens of white and red Mulberry-trees, the Leaves whereof serve to feed the Silk-worms; they are Planted so close, that a Man cannot go betwixt them; neither do they suffer them to grow above five Foot and a half high, that they may the better reach to lop all the Boughs.</P>
<P>There grows a sort of Shell-fruit call'd <HI>Mask,</HI> which is green, and about the bigness of a Pescod, but not so flat.</P>
<P>About <HI>Ispahan</HI> may be seen a little Tree nam'd <HI>Bidmisk,</HI> that is <HI>Willow-Musk,</HI> from its resemblance with the Willow, and smell of Musk; it hath in stead of Leaves or Flowers, a kind of Cod of pale green Threds, out of which is press'd a very cool∣ing Liquor, being an excellent Medicine against any Burning.</P>
<P>There is likewise the <HI>Tziaccacuei,</HI> or <HI>Fistick</HI>-Tree, both Male and Female, which differ little in shape, but the Males onely bear Fruit, being Berries, like those of a Lawrel, which grow at the ends of the Leaves five or six together. In these Berries breed little Flyes.</P>

<HEAD>Beasts.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts breed∣ing in this Countrey.</NOTE>THe Beasts for Food or Burden are gene∣rally Sheep, Goats, Beeves, Buffalo's, Camels, Horses, Mules, and Asses. The Sheep are kept in great Flocks as in <HI>Europe,</HI> for Mutton is their daily Food, but different from ours in taste, shape, and bigness, being for the most part bigger than ours, with high crooked Noses, long hanging Ears like Spaniels, with Tails of ten, twenty, and thirty Pound weight, which are nothing but Fat, yet their Bodies lean enough; though their Tails have exactly the same Joynts as our Sheep, yet the Fat grows so thick about them, that they are much larger in circumference, which makes them that they can∣not run fast or skip. The same kind of Sheep are amongst the <HI>Tartars</HI> on the West and North side of the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI></P>
<P>There are also whole Herds of Goats, whose Flesh is eaten, and their Tallow (of which one hath often twenty five Pound weight) made into Candles: Their Skins being Tann'd, are sent in∣to <HI>Poland, Muscovy,</HI> and all over <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There breed likewise many Buffalo's, especi∣ally in the Northern part near the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> in <HI>Serab,</HI> near <HI>Ardebil, Ervan,</HI> and <HI>Scherul,</HI> where some Husbandmen have five or six hundred of them: They thrive best in moist places, and their Milk is said to be very cooling. The <HI>Kilanean</HI> Buffalo's, like those in <HI>India,</HI> have a fat Bunch in their Necks near their Shoulders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persian</HI> Cows will not suffer themselves to be Milk'd, except their Calves be near them, so that when the Calf dies (for they never kill any) they stuff their Skins full of Straw, and strowing Salt thereon, bring the same to the Cow, which they Milk whil'st she licks off the Salt, for else she would never give down her Milk.</P>
<P>They have little regard for Hogs, and seldom or never eat of them; therefore the <HI>Armenian Christans</HI> which living amongst them have Dwel∣lings apart, as in <HI>Tzulfa</HI> and the <HI>Suburb</HI> of <HI>Ispahan,</HI> keep onely a few. But <HI>Crusius</HI> affirms, that they eat Swines-flesh by permission of their Prophet <HI>Aaly</HI> and <HI>Schach Ismael.</HI></P>
<P>Those Swine which breed here are most of them speckled.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants keep many Camels of several kinds; for some of them have two Bunches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camels of several sorts.</NOTE> and those we name Dromedaries, and the <HI>Persians Bughur,</HI> and those with one Bunch, <HI>Schuttur;</HI> of which last they have four sorts, and being of se∣veral Natures, are valu'd accordingly; the best sort are by them call'd <HI>Ner,</HI> which are generated by a <HI>Bughur</HI> and a <HI>Schutter;</HI> those which seldom breed, being call'd <HI>Maje,</HI> are very strong, and at cer∣tain times are able to carry a thousand weight, but that is onely when they are hot after Generation, which lasts commonly forty days, and is for the most part in Winter; during which time they eat little, foam at the Mouth, and are very fierce and angry, and therefore the Owners are forc'd to Muzzle them with an Iron Muzzle call'd <HI>Agrab.</HI> These <HI>Ners</HI> are generally sold for a hundred Crowns apiece; but if they chance to couple with the Female, then they lose their Strength, and grow lazy and disobedient, chusing rather to stay at home, wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> call them <HI>Jurda Caidem,</HI> which signifies <HI>Those that think of their Stable,</HI> and may be bought for thirty or forty Crowns. The third sort, call'd <HI>Lohk,</HI> though they are also sensible and hot for Procreation, yet they are not so good as the <HI>Bughurs;</HI> neither do they foam at the Mouth as the <HI>Ner,</HI> but in stead
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>thereof they blow forth a red Bladder out of their Throats, and swallow the same in again, hold out their Heads and gruntle, being neither so hardy nor so strong as the <HI>Ner;</HI> they are sold for sixty Crowns. The <HI>Persians</HI> from these two Beasts call a stout or va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iant Man <HI>Ner,</HI> and a Coward <HI>Lohk.</HI> The fourth and strongest sort they style <HI>Schutturi baad,</HI> and the <HI>Turks, Jeldowesi,</HI> that is, <HI>A Wind-Camel,</HI> which <HI>is</HI> smaller, and much swifter than the other, being able to out-run a Horse. The <HI>Sophy</HI> and his <HI>Chans</HI> or Vice-Roys, keep several Teams of these lesser Camels, which are employ'd either to fetch in Ambassadors, at which time they are caparison'd with Crimson Silks, and Bells, and other Ornaments about their Necks and before their Breasts, and have rich Embroider'd Saddles; or else they are us'd as we our Post-Horses, and carry Goods from Place to Place like Pack-Horses; and moreover they use them in their Wars, for if a Party chance to be defeated, they with more speed convey away their Baggage; but some of them Trot so hard, and as it were, Jumping, that no Man would be able to endure it long. One Man is able to ma∣nage seven or more, for he makes them fast one be∣hind another, and either rides upon, or walks be∣fore the foremost. It is very convenient travel∣ling in <HI>Persia</HI> by the help of these Camels, for by them Merchants have their Goods carry'd at rea∣sonable Rates; and if any Persons are not minded to travel alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Camels Diet.</NOTE> they go for their better security with the <HI>Cavila</HI> or <HI>Caravans.</HI> A Camel is for the most part fed with Nettles, Thistles, and other Weeds. On the Thistles oftentimes breed poy∣sonous Snails, in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Mohere,</HI> by which if a Camel be stung in the Nose, he dies soon after; therefore when the <HI>Persians</HI> are angry with them, they wish the <HI>Mo∣here</HI> to sting them in the Nose. They also mix Chaff and Barley together, and make Dough thereof in form like a long Loaf about three Pound weight, which they give them to eat: Sometimes they mix the Seed of the Cotton-Tree, which is about the bigness of a Pease, with it, which makes it very sweet, and with which a Camel being well fed, will travel two days with∣out Drinking, which is a great Providence in Nature, because in the Wildernesses and Sandy Desarts, through which they often travel, there is no Water to be found. The Camels of <HI>Persia</HI> are (according to <HI>Della Valle</HI>) fed with Barley Meal mix'd with Straw, and made into Balls: for if they eat Grass, it debilitates them both for Travel and Service: They are very willing to take up their Loads, for striking them onely on the Knees with a Switch, they immediately kneel-down, and lying with their Bellies on the Ground, suffer themselves to be loaden. They go much faster,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are pleas'd with Musick.</NOTE> and carry their Burdens with delight (as Mr. <HI>Sandis</HI> affirms) when their Drivers Whistle or Sing to them, or make them any other Musick; wherefore the Owners of them tie two Bells above the Knee of one of their fore Legs, and a Collar of small ones about their Necks. Mr. <HI>Pur∣chas</HI> relates, That the <HI>Arabians</HI> for the foremen∣tion'd Reason, never travel without a Drum and Drummer through the Desarts. The same is ju∣stifi'd by <HI>Leo Africanus,</HI> who adds, That when Travellers have tir'd their Camels, they need not beat them (which they regard not) to make them go forward, but onely Sing or Whistle a pleasant Tune, which so animates and refreshes them, that they go faster than a Man is able to run, to the end of their Journey.</P>
<P>These Beasts have a strong Memory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are revenge∣ful.</NOTE> are vin∣dicative, and do not easily forget an Injury done to them, wherefore the <HI>Persians</HI> commonly say, That a revengeful Man hath a Camels Spleen. But that there should be an Antipathy betwixt a Camel and a Horse (as <HI>Xenophon</HI> writes) is a mi∣stake, because it is very common in <HI>Persia,</HI> in one <HI>Caravan</HI> to have Camels, Horses, and Asses, which are often put in one Stable together, without offe∣ring the least hurt to one another.</P>
<P>The she Camels carry their Young twelve Moneths, and do not Generate backward, as some will have it, though it be true, that when they stand in the Stable they Urine backwards, which perhaps hath been the occasion of that mistake; for they Couple like other Beasts, onely the Fe∣male falls on her Belly.</P>
<P>Now in regard a Camel is a Beast that may be kept at a small charge, they are seldom kill'd in <HI>Persia,</HI> except they are stung by a <HI>Mohere,</HI> or fall down tir'd on the Road (as it often happens in deep Ways) and then they kill and eat them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Very good Breeds of Horses.</NOTE><HI>Persia</HI> is also stor'd with plenty of good Horses, most of them having very handsom Heads, Ears, Crest and Legs. In ancient time the Province of <HI>Media</HI> was famous for breeding of excellent Hor∣ses, which were call'd <HI>Nisean</HI> Horses, from a City of that Name; and (as <HI>Strabo</HI> tells us) the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> us'd no other. But though at this day the <HI>Median</HI> Horses, especially those in <HI>Erscheck</HI> near <HI>Ardebil,</HI> are good, yet the <HI>Arabian</HI> far exceed them, and are now us'd by the Kings, because they have very handsom Heads, Crest, Breast, and Feet, are long Winded, and have all the good Qualities else that Nature can bestow on a Horse. Next these the <HI>Turkish</HI> Horses are in great esteem, especially those that are bred in <HI>Turcomania,</HI> of which there are many in <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The King hath several peculiar Places for the breeding of Horses, especially at <HI>Erscheck, Schir∣wan, Carabach,</HI> and <HI>Mocan,</HI> where the best Pastu∣rage is. They generally use them to Ride on, but in <HI>Muscur</HI> they also draw in Carts, for Wa∣gons with four Wheels they use none. And be∣cause they are great lovers of Horses and Riding, and their chiefest Force consists in their Cavalry, therefore they breed them with great care. But in stead of Straw they Litter them with their own Dung, dry'd in the Sun, and strew'd a Foot thick under them, on which the Horses lie as soft as on Cotton; and if any of it become wet, it is taken from the rest and dry'd: They cover them also with a Hair Cloth Lin'd with Wool.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> have been Masters of these excel∣lent Horses since the Death of the Sultan <HI>Borisir,</HI> whom the King of <HI>Persia</HI> caus'd to be put to death, after his coming from <HI>Carmania</HI> into <HI>Persia,</HI> with many beautiful Horses, to the number of ten thou∣sand, of all which he made himself Master, and from them the <HI>Persians</HI> have had such excellent Breeds, that the <HI>Turks</HI> are inferior to them.</P>
<P>They bring up and diet their Horses for the Race; and those that are swift-footed they style <HI>Badpay,</HI> that is, <HI>Wind-footed;</HI> they also colour the Tails, Mayns, and Bellies of their white and dapple Horses, red or yellow. They are very cu∣rious in their Furniture, and therefore Persons of Quality Embroider their Sadles, Bridles, and Cloths with Gold and Silver, which is an ancient Pride of the <HI>Persians</HI> ever since the Reign of <HI>Xerxes.</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>These Horses, though employ'd night and day in a Battel, can endure thirty hours without Meat.</P>
<P>There are also a sort of Stags, by the <HI>Turks</HI> call'd <HI>Tzeirra,</HI> and by the <HI>Persians Ahu,</HI> of a sad colour, have great Horns, and being very swift-footed, are to be seen in no place but the Province of <HI>Mo∣can,</HI> and by <HI>Schamachie, Carabach,</HI> and <HI>Mearaga.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants likewise keep many Mules, especially to Ride on, being us'd by great Lords, nay, by the Kings themselves to travel on, they are valu'd at as dear a Rate as the Horses, and those that are any thing handsom are sold for a hundred Crowns. Moreover some have reported, that there are wild Mules found in several places in <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> but being very rare, they are onely sent as Pre∣sents to the King and <HI>Chans;</HI> and as <HI>Asia</HI> breeds more Asses than any other Place in the World, so <HI>Persia</HI> exceeds any of the Eastern Countreys.</P>

<HEAD>The several sorts of People.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>Persia</HI> are divers sorts of Inhabitants, <HI>viz.</HI> First Strangers of several Nations, which come thither to Traffick, amongst which the <HI>Indians</HI> are the most; as also <HI>Banians,</HI> who come thither out of the Province of <HI>Guzaratte.</HI> There are like∣wise several sorts of <HI>Christians, Assyrians, Nestorians,</HI> and <HI>Maronites;</HI> but the greatest number are <HI>Geor∣gians</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> who drive a very great Trade, and by reason of their Wealth, monopolize as it were most of the Commodities into their own hands, especially the Silk in the Countreys near the <HI>Turks,</HI> and dwell in great numbers in the Sub∣urb <HI>Zulfa</HI> in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> where several People out of <HI>Europe</HI> have their Residences, as <HI>English, Hollan∣ders, Portuguese,</HI> and others, to Trade.</P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>Persia</HI> are of two sorts, <HI>viz.

The Men go all after one fashion in their Habits; their Caps are round, like those of the present <HI>Persians,</HI> commonly quite white, without any other colours. The Women are also Cloth'd after one manner, but their Apparel hath greater resemblance with the <HI>Arabian</HI> or <HI>Chaldean,</HI> than the <HI>Persian:</HI> On their Heads they wear a handsom long Veyl of a green colour, which hangs down to their Wastes before, and touches the Ground behind; they always walk unvey'ld in the Streets, for a distinction from the <HI>Mahumetan Per∣sian</HI> Women. They are very simple, and speak a peculiar Language, differing from the modern <HI>Per∣sian,</HI> and use different Characters, which they Carve on the Doors of their Houses. They wor∣ship, and keep to this day, the <HI>Orimasda,</HI> or ever-burning Fire, after the same manner as the ancient Priests did, in the time of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Darius.</HI> They never go to Wars without the consecrated Wa∣gons, adorn'd with Gold, wherein the Fire was kept burning on Silver Altars. They also Pray three times a day, <HI>viz.</HI> Morning, Noon, and Evening, and Believe in one onely God, Creator of all things, who is invisible and omnipotent; where∣fore the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> have unjustly given them the Name of <HI>Gauren,</HI> or <HI>Idolaters.</HI> It hath been written by several, that they worship the Sun, Moon, and Stars, for lesser Angels, or rather, as they say them-themselves, by the Names of Angels. They curse <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and take him and all his Followers for Unbelievers. They abhor, and are afraid of Frogs, Tortoises, Lobsters, Crabs, and the like. They neither bury, nor burn their Dead, but keep them above Ground in a certain Wall'd place, where setting them upright with their Eyes open as if living, they prop them up with Forks, and so leave them till dropping down they dissolve by putrefa∣ction.</P>

The word <HI>Kisilbasch</HI> is by <HI>Euro∣rean</HI> Writers spell'd several ways, but the right Name (according to <HI>Olearius</HI>) is <HI>Kisilbasch,</HI> being a <HI>Turkish</HI> word, compounded from <HI>Kisil,</HI> that is, <HI>Red,</HI> and also signifies <HI>Gold,</HI> and <HI>Basch,</HI> that is, <HI>A Head,</HI> and apply'd to them by reason of the several sorts of red Caps they wear.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Jovius</HI> and <HI>Bizarro,</HI> the first In∣venter of these Caps amongst the <HI>Persians,</HI> was one <HI>Techellis,</HI> a Disciple of <HI>Harduellis,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Eider;</HI> but <HI>Minadoi</HI> and <HI>Olearius</HI> think otherwise: for they say, when the <HI>Persians</HI> upon the advice of <HI>Sofi</HI> or <HI>Sefi,</HI> the Promoter of their Sect, fell from the <HI>Turkish</HI> Religion, and began to honor <HI>Aaly</HI> be∣yond <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his Followers, <HI>Omar, Osman,</HI> and <HI>Abubeker,</HI> they would have the twelve Succes∣sors of <HI>Aaly</HI> (as shall be declar'd at large in their Religion) to be accounted and worshipp'd as <HI>Imams</HI> or Saints: As a testimony whereof, the religious Orders were, according to a Law made at that time,
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>to wear Caps with twelve Plaits or Folds, sharp on the top, and broad at bottom: But because the <HI>Turks</HI> after this fell up on the <HI>Persians</HI> several times, and kill'd the Priests, who were accounted the chief Incendiaries, they began upon this Divisi∣on to leave off their Caps, that so they might not be known:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ismael Sefi</HI> prepares an Army against the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> But when <HI>Schach Ismael Sefi</HI> prepar'd to set out an Army against the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had alrea∣dy penetrated far into <HI>Persia,</HI> he sent from <HI>Kilan,</HI> whither he retir'd, to the eminentest Provinces and Towns, to acquaint them with the intolerable Op∣pression the Countrey and their Religion would lie under, in case the <HI>Turks</HI> should become their Ma∣sters; therefore he desir'd the Natives to joyn with him to beat out the Enemy, with a Promise, that if he should re-gain the Kingdom, he would make all those Persons that so assisted him, a general In∣franchisement, without paying any manner of Tribute, which so pleas'd the <HI>Persians,</HI> that in a short time they rais'd an Army of three hundred thousand Men, and made their first Attempt upon the City <HI>Ardebil,</HI> from whence they drove the <HI>Turks</HI> Garrison without any resistance; after which the several Provinces entred into a Con∣tract with the King, that they would venture their Lives and Fortunes in defence of him and their Religion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first red Caps.</NOTE> In testimony whereof the King order'd the foremention'd plaited Caps, which were to signifie the twelve <HI>Imams,</HI> or <HI>Aaly</HI>'s Successors, to be made and distributed amongst the Soldiers; but there being not so much red Cloth in <HI>Ardebil,</HI> a Shoemaker made the first twelve of red Leather, and presented them to the King, who save them to his prime Commanders: After which time, every Soldier in King <HI>Ismael</HI>'s Army wore a red Cap, which the <HI>Turks</HI> seeing, call'd them <HI>Kisilbasch,</HI> or <HI>Red-Heads.</HI> These Caps are by them call'd <HI>Tash</HI> or <HI>Tagh,</HI> that is, <HI>A Crown,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Persi∣ans</HI> are well pleas'd with the Name <HI>Kisilbasch,</HI> be∣cause it signifies <HI>Red,</HI> or rather <HI>Gold-Heads.</HI> The yet remaining Successors of <HI>Aaly</HI> also wear these Caps, which being commonly ty'd about with Rib∣bons are call'd <HI>Taky.

Six∣teen of these Families are call'd <HI>Right-handed,</HI> and the other sixteen <HI>Left-handed Men,</HI> because the first sixteen are always seen on the Kings right, and the other sixteen on his left Side, as well in Mar∣ches and other Cavalcades, as in the <HI>Divan</HI> or Council-house, or the Kings Court.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinguish'd into Tribes.</NOTE><HI>John</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> saith the Tribes of the <HI>Quizil∣bascies</HI> are as so many Noble Houses or Families, as Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls. But this <HI>Della Valle</HI> contradicts, affirming, that they are not Fa∣milies, but Tribes, distinguish'd by peculiar Names or Titles, which they either made choise of them∣selves, or were given to them by King <HI>Ismael</HI> in the beginning, for their heroick Exploits. Moreover, the great number of the <HI>Quizilbascies</HI> is a sufficient testimony of the Tribes: Likewise those of one Tribe have no Relation to those of another, but onely bear the same Name. Add hereunto the great difference in the Qualities of the People in one Tribe, for some of them are <HI>Chans, Sultans,</HI> and <HI>Beigs,</HI> which may stand in competition with our Lords; others, nay the greatest number, are poor People, in so mean Condition, that they are for∣ced to serve for Grooms and Servants; yet never∣theless they bear the same Title with the <HI>Sultan</HI> or <HI>Chan</HI> of the same Tribe.</P>
<P>There are also a People call'd <HI>Reajet</HI> or <HI>Tat,</HI> that is, <HI>Subjects,</HI> which are, as among us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reaja</HI> or <HI>Tat,</HI> what it signi∣fies.</NOTE> accounted the vulgar or meanest of the Commonalty; for the Name <HI>Tat</HI> is given to Mechanicks: Yet never∣theless, if we make a farther enquiry into the Name <HI>Tat,</HI> we shall find it to be more Noble than that of <HI>Quizilbasci,</HI> because <HI>Tat</HI> is the Name of those Ex∣tracted from the real and ancient Loyns of the <HI>Persians,</HI> and therefore the King gives it not onely to People of mean Condition, but also to the richest and most powerful, nay, to the <HI>Myrsa</HI> and Princes of the Blood; and lastly, to all those, who out of fear, or for other Reasons have laid down Arms, or resigning publick Offices have deserted the Court.</P>

<HEAD>Complexion, Nature, and Shape of the Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the <HI>Persians.</HI></NOTE>THe <HI>Persians</HI> are naturally endu'd with Pru∣dence and Understanding, quick Witted, and Learned, wherefore there are many excellent Poets amongst them; they highly esteem Moral Philosophy, are not inclin'd to any disdain∣ful Behavior, but are affable and courteous, not onely to one another, but especially to Strangers, to whom (as we said before) they are also very hos∣pitable; and in their Discourses use many comple∣mental Expressions. When they invite any one to their House, they commonly say, <HI>Honor my House with your Presence; I offer my self to you;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com∣plements.</NOTE> <HI>I pro∣strate my self at your Feet,</HI> and the like; for they are very full of such obliging Expressions. <HI>Della Valle</HI> affirms the contrary, and that their Meetings con∣sist in Eating and Drinking without speaking, all their Ceremonies being onely these words of course, <HI>You are welcom; How do you? There is your appointed place;</HI> which they repeat many times. <HI>Olearius</HI> says, that it is no shame among them in the
<PB N="48" REF="52"/><HI>Persian</HI> Tongue, to say <HI>Drug Micui,</HI> or in the <HI>Tur∣kish, Galan Dierfen,,</HI> that is, <HI>You Lye,</HI> or <HI>Galantzi, You are a Lyer,</HI> but in ancient Times they were of another Nature, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirms. They are very faithful one to another, especially if they are sworn Friends, for it is common among them to swear Fidelity and Friendship one to another as long as they live, which is perform'd after the fol∣lowing manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">They swear Friendship to one another.</NOTE> The great Families or Tribes ge∣nerally meet once a year, when they Feast and make Merry; and if any one have a peculiar kind∣ness for another, then he says, <HI>Come let us be sworn Brothers;</HI> and this is commonly perform'd between two: And because these Brothers must have a Fa∣ther, they chuse one whom they think fit, and ta∣king him by the Lappet of his Coat, say, <HI>We make you our Babba,</HI> or <HI>Father,</HI> which he dare not refuse. These going to the <HI>Califf</HI> (who hath every ones Fa∣mily Registred) kiss his Hand in token of their Friendship; and being set down in a Register for that purpose, they lay themselves down one behind another on their Bellies, first the Father, and next the Brothers; whereupon the <HI>Califf</HI> gives each of them three light Blows with a Stick on their Backs, and at the first says, <HI>Alla,</HI> that is, <HI>God;</HI> at the second, <HI>Mahumet;</HI> and at the third, <HI>Aaly;</HI> which done, they kissing the Staff, Sign and conclude the Agree∣ment of Brotherly Friendship, which they really keep, and are more faithful to one another than Brothers, affirming, that they shall sooner meet in Paradise than real Brothers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An annual Feast of fra∣ternal So∣ciety.</NOTE>They also keep an annual Feast of fraternal So∣ciety on the twenty fifth day of <HI>November,</HI> in com∣memoration of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s declaring his Son <HI>Aly</HI> Heir and Successor in the Califfdom on that day; when also not onely many Enemies are reconcil'd one with another, but divers, from the Example of their Lawgiver <HI>Mahomet,</HI> adopt Strangers, which they do by putting them naked between their bare Bodies and Shirt, and so pulling them out at the bottom thereof. This Friendship they acccount so inviolable, that they repute other Crimes in respect of the breach thereof but as Peccadillo's, and therefore in ordinary Discourse say proverbially, <HI>Mei buchur munbur bussusan ote∣schei, Ender Chihesen Sakini, But chane basch merdum Asari,</HI> that is, <HI>Drink Wine, Set the Pulpit and Church on Fire, Burn an Abdalla's Coat, Be seen in an Idols Temple,</HI> (all which are abominable, and forbidden Sins) <HI>But wrong not your Friend.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Recon∣ciliation after Difference.</NOTE>If any thing chance to happen which causes a Contention among the Brotherhood, they are forc'd to reconcile it at the next general Meeting the following year; for then the Offended goes to the Offenders Door, and stands in a mournful Posture, with his Head and Hands hanging down, till the Offender hath invited him three several times into his House, from whence they go toge∣ther to the Assembly, which judges who is most to be blam'd of them, and condemns the Offender to make a Feast; and upon this Reconciliation they are Registred a second time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature and Disposi∣tion of the People.</NOTE>They are grateful to those that give them any thing, but revengeful to those that do them a Pre∣judice; they are valiant, and consequently good Soldiers, and often hazard their Lives in apparent danger. They seem to be modest and bashful, be∣ing never seen to make Water standing, but squatting down, and immediately after washing their Hands to which purpose at all their Feasts stand Pots of Water in private places, or if there be a Brook near them, they run thither; wherefore the <HI>Turks</HI> call them <HI>Cher Schahei,</HI> that is, <HI>The Kings Asses,</HI> because the Asses, whenever they go cross a Stream, always Urine in the same. The <HI>Turks</HI> on the contrary are by the <HI>Persians</HI> call'd <HI>Secksunni,</HI> or <HI>Dogs,</HI> because they Urine a∣gainst the Wall, which commonly the Soldiers and vulgar <HI>Turks</HI> do, yet the better sort sit down like the <HI>Persians.</HI> No <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Turk</HI> eases himself with his Face or Back towards the South, because <HI>Mahomet</HI> lies bury'd in the South.</P>
<P>The right Hand is by the <HI>Persians,</HI> as amongst us, accounted the chiefest and highest place of Honor; but on the contrary, the <HI>Turks</HI> esteem the left most worthy. They never pull off their Caps or <HI>Turbants,</HI> unless when they go to Pray, or appear before the King or other great Lords; for their usual way of Salutation, is to bow, and to lay their Hands on their Breasts. They account it a great piece of rudeness to ask any Person of Quality his Name or Condition, or in his Pre∣sence to enquire after it. They are lean, and very strong Limm'd, of a dark brown, or sallow Com∣plexion, and in general are Hawk-nos'd, as 'tis said that great <HI>Persian</HI> King <HI>Cyrus</HI> was. The Men shave the Hair off their Heads, which is very, black, every eight days, but the <HI>Seids</HI> wear long Hair, as they say <HI>Mahomet</HI> did: they all have long Mustacho's, and the longer they are, the more pride they take in them for such as wear Mustacho's that hang downwards, are ac∣counted great Zealots but such as turn up their Beards, they say are presumptuous, as if they were minded to Engage with Heaven.</P>
<P>There are also a sort of People in <HI>Persia</HI> which never cut the Hair upon their upper Lip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persians</HI> take great care of their Hair, and why.</NOTE> but let∣ting it grow over their Mouths, are call'd <HI>Suffi</HI> or <HI>Sefi;</HI> and this they do, because (as they say) <HI>Aly</HI> wore his Beard after that manner, and the reason thereof they give in the following Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That when <HI>Mahomet</HI> was commanded by God up to Heaven, <HI>Aly</HI> went after him, and knocking at Heaven Gate, they would not at first permit him to come in, but saying that he was <HI>Schir Chadda,</HI> that is, <HI>Gods Favorite,</HI> he was let in, and saw the Angels Entertain <HI>Mahomet</HI> with a celestial Liquor, of which a Cup being also brought full to him, he drunk, and therefore he thought it would be a great Sin to diminish the least Hair which had been drench'd in so heavenly a Liquor. Moreo∣ver, the <HI>Persians</HI> have a great aversion to red Hair, neither do they delight in fair, but are great ad∣mirers of Cole-black Hair; wherefore many co∣lour their Hair, which they do after this manner: They take the Herb with the Seed, by them call'd <HI>Wesme,</HI> and brought from <HI>Babylon</HI> (which <HI>Olearius</HI> supposes to be one and the same with <HI>Securidaca,</HI> an Eastern Plant not known among us,) adding Gauls, a little Soap and Orpement amongst them, and boyling it in Water, dip their Hair therein, washing it off again with Lye mix'd with un∣slak'd Lime. They also gather the Water which in the Spring comes from the pruned Vines, and wet their Mustacho's therewith, as also the Wo∣men their Hair, for they affirm that it makes their Hair grow long and black.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They Paint their Hands.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians,</HI> as also the <HI>Turks,</HI> colour their Hands red and yellow, though some do onely their Fingers and Nails; and this kind of colour∣ing is at all their Nuptials set upon the Table amongst other Dishes before the Guests, to use when they please. It is also affirm'd, that they Paint their dead Bodies, specially those of Virgins,
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>with the dry'd Leaves of <HI>Chinne</HI> or <HI>Alcanna,</HI> that they may appear beautiful in their Grave to their two Angels or Confessors. Some, to make the Colour look brown, rub their Hands with the Leaves, or green Rinds of Walnuts, which keeps fresh on their Hands above forty days, notwith∣standing they warn them every day.</P>
<P>In their Walking they waddle from side to side like Geese, especiallv the Women; and there is not one <HI>Persian</HI> that hath a steady or hand∣som Gate, which <HI>Oleariues</HI> supposes to proceed from their manner of sitting on the Floor like Taylors, with their Legs under them; but this is not probable, for then all the Eastern People which use to sit after the same manner, would be subject to the like Impediment.</P>

<HEAD>Of their Venery.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Persians</HI> much inclin'd to Wanton∣ness.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> exceed most Countreys in Wantoness and venerial Exercises: for besides their great number of Wines, they are very much inclin'd to variety of Women, and in all their Cities, except <HI>Ardebil,</HI> are kept publick Brothel-houses, under the Protection of the Magistrates: for which Priviledge the <HI>Cabeh,</HI> or Strumpets, pay great Tribute.</P>
<P>The present <HI>Persians</HI> never keep any great Feasts; nay, the King himself at Court seldom Entertains foreign Ambassadors; yet divers Ladies of Pleasure always attend there, which are expert in Dancing, Singing, and the like. But in <HI>Ardebil,</HI> it being a Consecrated Place, none of their Debaucheries are permitted, by special Order from <HI>Schach Abbas.</HI></P>
<P>A Master of a Feast always Presents his Guests with several sorts of Liquor, and then such Wo∣men efpecially as they best like; whereupon those that please retire into a private Chamber fit∣ted for that purpose; from whence after most in∣ward Embraces, they come forth without the least bashfulness, the Man to his Place, and the Woman falls to Dancing.</P>
<P>This Custom of providing Women at a great Feast is very ancient amongst the <HI>Persians:</HI> for long since when the <HI>Persian</HI> Ambassadors were highly Entertain'd by <HI>Anuntas,</HI> King of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> they also desir'd to have Women, saying. <HI>It is a Custom amongst us</HI> Persians, <HI>when we make great Feasts, to bring in such, to the heightning md compleating our Pleasures;</HI> as is at large describ'd by <HI>Herodotus.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Sefi</HI> kept several of these Women for his Recreation; and <HI>Curtius</HI> tells us, that <HI>Darius</HI> car∣ry'd three hundred and sixty Concubines along with him in his Progresses and Travels, which were all Cloth'd in Royal Attire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are guilty of Sodomy.</NOTE>But that which is worse, they are extreamly ad∣dicted to the horrid Sin of Sodomy, which <HI>Herodo∣tus</HI> affirms they learn'd from the <HI>Greeks;</HI> but that seems an unjust Imputation, because the <HI>Persians</HI> were guilty of the same before they had any Con∣verse with the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that at <HI>Cambru</HI> there are ma∣ny <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Youths, which from their Girdles upward, are Cloth'd like Men, and from their Wastes downward, like Women, and go up and down, the Streets inviting to this Abomination. But 'tis no wonder they give themselves over to this kind of Sin, since their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> did not a little encourage them therein: Nay, they are instructed, that all carnal Delights whatsoever will be the greatest and chiefest Enjoyment in the other World by which means this Religion is the more follow'd.</P>

<HEAD>Their Apparel.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habits.</NOTE>AMongst the <HI>Persians</HI> the Men let their Gar∣ments hang loose about their lower Parts, so that at a distance they shew like Wo∣men; which Fashion <HI>Diodorus</HI> tells us they took from the <HI>Virago Semiramis,</HI> who went accordingly Habited.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Della Valle,</HI> the <HI>Persians</HI> Clothes differ much in fashion from the <HI>Turks,</HI> as being narrower, sleighter, and cut and slash'd: The under Garment next the Shirt, by reason of its shortness not seen, is generally of very fine <HI>Indian</HI> Cotton, stain'd with colour'd Imagery. Their upper Sum∣mer Garment is long, strait-body'd, and hangs loose over their Bellies, having long and plaited Sleeves, and from the Girdle downward made wider like a Bell, and Lin'd with Cotton. This Coat is com∣monly made of fine colour'd <HI>Indian</HI> Linnen, others of Cotton or Silk, which when new, having a Gloss like Sattin, is call'd <HI>Cotoni.</HI> Their upper Garment in Winter is a short Coat, which being worn by Troopers, just covers the Horses Back; the common People wear somewhat longer, yet not so long as to hang below their Knees: These Coats are for the most part made of Cloth, and sometimes, though very seldom, of Silk and Cloth of Tissue, and Lin'd with Furr, which the <HI>Persians</HI> have in great abundance, and adorn'd with Silk Buttons and Loops, of a different colour from the Cloth. Not onely the Soldiers, but also the com∣mon People, have two sorts of these upper Coats. The Men wear a great <HI>Turbant</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Mendil,</HI> made of Cotton or Silk Ribbons or Sashes wound one over another, and some intermix'd with Golden Thred, sixteen or eighteen Yards long. <HI>Della Valle</HI> saith, that the <HI>Turbants</HI> are made of spotted Cotton, and very seldom all white. Persons of Quality most com∣monly wear them stitch'd with Silver and Gold; but the meaner sort make them of such Stuffs as please their Fancy. These <HI>Turbants</HI> being always very large, cover the Caps that are worn under them. There is no distinction of Persons by their <HI>Turbants,</HI> as amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> but the <HI>Christians</HI> may wear the same fashion'd Clothes and <HI>Tur∣bants</HI> as the other <HI>Persians,</HI> except the red Cap which they call <HI>Tat,</HI> that is, <HI>A Crown,</HI> which is a peculiar Badge of the Nobility, and sometimes (as we said before) of the Soldiery. The Succes∣sors of <HI>Aaly,</HI> their greatest Prophet next <HI>Mahomet,</HI> wear Caps with high Crowns: In the Winter against the Cold they wear a long Cap under their <HI>Turbants,</HI> Lin'd with Furr, the end whereof appears out of the top of the <HI>Turbant,</HI> and being wide at bottom, they pull the same quite over their Forehead and Ears, to keep off the Wea∣ther. Priests, especially the <HI>Hasis,</HI> wear for
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the most part white ones, of which colour also is their other Apparel; some of them wear a Lap∣pet about half a Yard long down behind their <HI>Turbants.</HI> The <HI>Seids,</HI> which are such as boast them∣selves to be Extracted from <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and conse∣quently his Successors, wear the fore-mention'd Lappet of green Cloth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The several Habits of Men.</NOTE> Some <HI>Persians,</HI> especi∣ally great Lords, wear Caps, cover'd without and Lin'd with a finer sort of Sheep-skins, and turn'd up with the same; the Wooll whereof being as soft as Silk, is about a Fingers length. These Caps are as highly esteem'd there as our Beavers are here. Noblemen wear a fort of <HI>Turbants</HI> with high Plumes, adorn'd with Precious Stones and Pearls; and by these a Nobleman may be distin∣guish'd from other Persons: for the Nobility one∣ly are permitted to wear a Coronet with twelve Points, which was brought up by the first <HI>Sophy.</HI> The Stuff of these is brought out of <HI>India,</HI> and are stronger, and of a better colour than those of <HI>Per∣sia.</HI> But a <HI>Molla</HI> or Priest that wears the foremen∣tion'd Silk Sashes, must lay it by him out of Re∣verence to God, when he Prays before the <HI>Ma∣here.</HI> Under these Sashes they wear their Hand∣kerchiffs, Knives, Purses, Inkhorns, and Table-Books. Over their Coats the King and other eminent Persons wear a <HI>Curdu,</HI> or short Jump, which comes down to their Hips, but Fac'd down before with Sable. When they go abroad, or Ride, they commonly hang another Coat over the same, made of Silk, and wrought with Gold, and is therefore call'd <HI>Jacub Cahni,</HI> from a King of the same Name which first us'd it. Their Breeches, made of Cotton, and very narrow, reach down to their Ancles, and are ty'd on the top with a String, over which hangs their Shirt, which is commonly Strip'd Red, and Lac'd on the Breast or Sides with yellow Laces. The Mens Stockings, made of fine Cloth, are ill shap'd, and hang unhandsomly a∣bout their Legs; some are of green Cloth, which the <HI>Turks</HI> cannot endure, because it is a scandal to their Religion; for they say that <HI>Mahomet</HI> wore a green Cap, which Colour the <HI>Persians</HI> in disdain wear on their Feet. Moreover all their Clothes are of several Colours; but above all, the Car∣nation is in greatest esteem amongst them, and is call'd <HI>Al</HI> Amongst other dark Colours, they have of late years gotten a <HI>French,</HI> or sad Green, which they call <HI>Nefti,</HI> from an Oyl of the same Name. Their Shoes call'd <HI>Kef,</HI> end in a sharp Point, and have such low Quarters, that they can slip their Feet in and out without any trouble, as if they were Slippers, though with high Heels, and plated underneath with Iron. When they go into their Halls, or other Apartments, they leave their Shoes at the Door like the <HI>Turks,</HI> by which means there areas many Shoes commonly stand∣ing before the Court or Council Chamber, as in a Shoemakers Shop, and a Man appointed for that purpose to take charge of them, who gives to every one his own.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Persians</HI> gird them∣selves almost under their Bellies with two Gir∣dles, one upon another; the longest is made of cer∣tain thick Silk-Stuff, which being pretty broad and very long, they wind three or four times about their Bodies; some of them are streak'd and wrought with Gold; others curiously flower'd, and some plain. Some Girdles also are double, and made of two sorts of Silk, without any Orna∣ments, except that the one side is of one colour, and the other of another. The upper Girdle, which they wear above the great one, is shorter, narrower, and of one colour, and is either made of Silk, Camels Hair, or Cotton, yet not less esteem'd than those of Silk, because they are of∣ten richer, and sometimes dearer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habits of Women.</NOTE>The Habits of the ordinary Women are very mean, but the rich wear Cloth and Silk wrought with Gold; they are clear, and of a more beco∣ming shape than the <HI>Turkish</HI> Women. Those that are Marry'd or Betrothed, are permitted to wear a Girdle and a Plume of Feathers, which is also a distinction of Nobility.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Habits of the Women.</NOTE>The Womens Garments are much thinner than the Mens, and hang loose about their Bo∣dies, having underneath Shifts and Drawers down to the Ancles like the Men. Their Stockings are commonly either Crimson or green Velvet, Cloth of Tissue, or other rich Stuffs. They have no pe∣culiar Head-Tires, but are dress'd after the same fashion as the Ladies of <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon.</HI> Their Hair hangs down in Tresses, both behind and in Locks, and curls before. About their Heads they wear two or three Strings of Pearl, but none about their Necks, and let them hang below their Cheeks. Young Maids also wear a Diamond Ring in their right Nostril, several Gold Rings on their Fingers, and broad Silver Armlets.</P>
<P>The Men, according to a Law made by <HI>Maho∣met,</HI> may onely wear Silver Rings.</P>
<P>Women of Quality go after the Eastern man∣ner in the Streets with a long white Vail over their Faces, which hangs down to the Ground, and have onely a little Slit therein, through which they look. And this Fashion they took up, not so much out of Modesty, as some suppose, or the Jealousie of their Husbands, or by reason of any Law amongst the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> but rather from their proud Humor, judging very few worthy to look them in the Face: for before <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s time, the Women of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> went al∣ways with cover'd Faces. And to this purpose <HI>Peter Bizarro,</HI> in his ancient History of <HI>Persia,</HI> makes mention of King. <HI>Tyridates</HI>'s Queen, who coming with her Husband into <HI>Italy,</HI> was Vail'd with Cloth of Tissue. And the modern Custom confirms this Opinion, because a great Lady, in the Presence of a Nobleman, King or Prince, uncovers her Face, in testimony of the great Honor, and high Esteem she hath for him; but no Woman will shew her Face either to her Equal or Inferior: And on the contrary, the Women of inferior Rank expose their Faces to open view both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>If the Clothes of Noble Persons be never so little soil'd or spotted, they immediately leave them off; but the poorer sort wash theirs every Week.</P>
<P>Foot-boys or Pages wear no Liveries there, because it is not the Fashion, but are Clothed in various colour'd Stuffs, unsuitable one to another, though one Mans Servants.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hourse-keeping, very mean.</NOTE>THe <HI>Persians</HI> House-keeping is generally very mean, and the Utensils belonging to their Larder, Kitchin and Cellar, if they have not many Wives, require no great Charge.</P>
<P>Besides Rice, their chiefest Food is Flesh, which is to be had every where in great abun∣dance, except at <HI>Ispahan,</HI> because that is a very populous Place.</P>
<P><HI>Bizarro</HI> avers them to be great Gluttons, but it seems to be without cause.</P>
<P><HI>Justin</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> say the <HI>Persians</HI> eat little Flesh, but have store of Confections, which <HI>Alexander ab Alexandro</HI> also affirms.</P>
<P><HI>Olearius</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Persians</HI> keep but one set Meal a day, besides which they eat a little Bread, Butter, Cheese, and Fruit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pilao</HI> their chief Dish.</NOTE>The chiefest Dish, and always brought first to the Table, is boyl'd Rice, by them call'd <HI>Plau,</HI> or <HI>Pilao,</HI> with Mutton. After that they bring roasted Fowl, Fish, Spinnage, and white Cabbage (for brown they esteem not,) to the Table.</P>
<P><HI>Ispahan</HI> hath little fresh, but plenty of salt Fish, because of its great distance from the Sea, and
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>the Brook which runs about <HI>Ispahan,</HI> having no manner of relation to the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea. There are likewise abundance of Fowls, of all which they eat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Dyer.</NOTE> except Turkeys, whereof a <HI>Georgian</HI> Mer∣chant in the time of <HI>Schach Abas</HI> brought some from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and sold them for Sixteen Crowns apiece. Though they use Rice in stead of Bread, yet they have Rouls, or Loaves made of Wheat; one sort thereof call'd <HI>Comasch,</HI> is three Fingers thick, and a Yard long: the <HI>Lawash</HI> are round Cakes of an Inch thick: the <HI>Peasekean</HI> are also a Yard long, baked in the <HI>Tenurs,</HI> or House-Ovens, and being five Inches broad, have their name from thence. The <HI>Senged</HI> are hollow; the <HI>Jucha</HI> are thin, like Parchment or Wafers, about a Yard long, and as broad, which being used first as Napkins to wipe their greasie Fingers on, (for they take the Rice out of the Dish with their Fin∣ger with which they also pull their Meat asun∣der, seldom using either Knives or Forks) they pull the same to pieces, and rouling Rice or Pieces of Flesh into them, eat them up with a great Appetite. They sup their Broaths, or Pot∣tages with woodden Spoons, made after an Oval fashion with a small Handle, but a quarter of a yard long, like short Ladles.</P>
<P>The Grandees going to Dinner, spread a <HI>Sofra</HI> on the Floor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of eating.</NOTE> that is a painted Cloth as big as the whole Room: They use no Napkins, but every one according to the Countrey fashion, makes use of his Handkerchief tuckt at his Girdle, being very large, made of painted Linnen, and either wrought with Silver or Gold. Noblemen, though they have good Kitchins to cook their Meat in, yet oftentimes they will have it drest where they please, not so much out of curiosity, as suspition of being poison'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Drink.</NOTE>The meaner sort of People for the most part drink Water, sometimes mixt with <HI>Duschab,</HI> and a little Verjuice to make it good <HI>Beverage;</HI> and though Wine by very cheap, yet many abstain from it, because it is forbidden in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law. Moreover, the <HI>Hatzi</HI> which have been at <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina</HI> by <HI>Mabumets</HI> Tomb, are also de∣barr'd from Wine all their lives.</P>
<P>Nevertheless many of the Courtiers drink Wine freely, and are of opinion that the Sin com∣mitted by the drinking thereof, may be pardon'd by the same means as their other Sins; neither are they concern'd the next morning at their be∣ing over-taken. The Cups out of which they drink are woodden Skiffs, or little Dishes. They never force any to drink; and though, according to our Custom, they give the Cup round, yet those that are unwilling may pass it by, without any breach of Drinking-Law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Prohibition against the drinking of Wine.</NOTE><HI>Anno</HI> 1620. King <HI>Abbas</HI> falling into a great Fit of Sickness at <HI>Ferhabad,</HI> occasion'd by a Potation of too much Wine, he caused an Edict to be publish'd with the sound of Trumpet; wherein all the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> in <HI>Ispahan</HI> were forbid to drink Wine, yet the <HI>Armenians, Georgians, Franks,</HI> and other <HI>Christians</HI> may Carouse as much Wine as they please, provided they neither sell nor give any to the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> upon pain of death.</P>
<P>This Law was with great strictness observ'd publickly by all the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> not onely in <HI>Is∣pahan,</HI> but through all the Kings Dominions, in∣somuch that some for violation thereof were put to death. This seem'd to be too severe a Law for the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> especially the Courtiers, where∣fore they address'd themselves to the <HI>Aga Chizi,</HI> the Kings greatest Favorite, and other great Lords at the Kings Court, to implore the King to Repeal it, with promise that they would raise him a great Sum of Money; but all prov'd in vain, for the King continu'd firm in his Resolution.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle,</HI> who at that time was at <HI>Ispahan</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> tells us, that he had more Visitants, espe∣cially of the Grandees, than usual, because the King had not onely given him a Toleration for drinking Wine himself, but to distribute to those <HI>Mahumetans</HI> that Visited and made Addresses to him, provided he suffer'd them not to use any such excess; as to be seen inebriated in the Street repair∣ing home.</P>
<P>Moreover, the King himself drank Wine pri∣vately, yet very little, that so he might not be an ill Example to his Subjects; to which he pretend∣ed that his Distemper forc'd him, according to the directions of his Physicians, who prescrib'd him to drink onely what might be conducible to his better Health.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants in the Province of <HI>Persia,</HI> of which <HI>Sciras</HI> is the Metropolis, drink Wine pub∣lickly; and the rather, because being far from the Court they are become as it were Lawless: But in the other Provinces the Laws are so observ'd, that it is dangerous to mention Wine.</P>
<P>In all the Country about <HI>Ardebil</HI> are no Vines, partly by reason of the Cold, and partly because the <HI>Sceichavends,</HI> that is, <HI>Scheicks Successors,</HI> would not plant any there, because it was a sacred Place, where <HI>Scheich Sofi</HI> set up a New Sect, which next to <HI>Mahomets</HI> at <HI>Mecha,</HI> and that of <HI>Aly</HI> and <HI>Hussein,</HI> is most follow'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kitchin Furni∣ture.</NOTE>In their Kitchins they use Pots or Kettles of Clay, and some of Copper Furnaces, Tin'd over. Their Dishes are also of Copper most curiously wrought, and being Tinn'd over, feem to be of Silver; besides which, they use abundance of <HI>China</HI> Dishes and other Vessels: but in the Villages they have Earthen Ware.</P>
<P>In all the Towns of the Kingdom are abundance of Cooks Shops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abundance of Cooks Shops.</NOTE> wherein they sell Meat ready drest; which is so common, that Persons of great Quality (though they have Cooks in their Hou∣ses) when desirous of Varieties of Meat well drest, they send to those Shops for them.</P>
<P>Those tyfeats which they baste with their But∣ter, at first seem very ill tasled to a Palat not ac∣custom'd thereto, but afterwards obtain a more pleasing Rellish.</P>
<P>They also have a Bak' d-meat call'd <HI>Perian,</HI> and another call'd <HI>Carik,</HI> dress'd after the <HI>Indian</HI> manner.</P>
<P>There are also preserv'd Cucumbers, which are very palatable; and in the midst of Summer cooling.</P>
<P>They have likewise a dainty Dish, call'd <HI>Peluda;</HI> made up of <HI>Ameldonk</HI> or <HI>Amelcores,</HI> in the manner of a Tart; either made white like Snow, or else they colour them with Saffron. The Tart cut in pieces, is put into a <HI>China</HI>-Dish, and Rose∣water and Sugar pour'd over it, and a great piece of Ice laid by it; which melting in the Rose-wa∣ter with the Sugar, makes a delicious and cool Liquor; into which are put Almonds, and the Herb Purslan cut into small pieces; which give it a very pleasing Rellish: This Liquor put into the same Dish with the pieces of Tart, is both Meat and Drink, and a choice Delicate in the midst of Summer.</P>
<P>They also highly esteem the Herb <HI>Dragon;</HI>

</FIGURE> and whenever they cover the Table, they eat a great quantity thereof, with Salt and Bread which they usually chaw before Dinner to provoke their Appetite, and after to help Digestion; of which, most of the Common-people make their Meals, eating onely some Bread dipt in <HI>Sechien;</HI> a Liquor made of Vinegar and Sugar, and carried about the Streets to be sold in Tubs; which is not onely pleasing to the Palat, but also comfortable to the Stomach.</P>
<P>In the Southern Countreys, especially West∣ward, about <HI>Ormus;</HI> they use many Herbs in their Drinks; as also Brandy, and other hot Liquors, amongst which, one call'd <HI>Jarkin;</HI> which is in great esteem in the Island of <HI>Java,</HI> and all the Southern Provinces of the Eastern Countreys, they use also much Sale, and though between <HI>Ispa∣han</HI> and <HI>Ferhabad,</HI> there is a large Plain that yields great quantityes, the Soyl being full of Salt, yet they use another sort; contemning this, though good, by reason of it's great plenty.</P>
<P>Before and after Meals, the <HI>Persians</HI> both in Winter and Summer, have warm Water to wash their hands, which they wipe with their Handker∣chiefs. After Supper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They paint their Skins.</NOTE> they commonly present their Guests with dryed Leaves of <HI>Hanna</HI> or <HI>Al∣kanna</HI> to colour their Hands; and this Ceremo∣ny is as much to the satisfaction of the Eastern Countrey-people, as a Ball, with Dancing or Mu∣sick after a Banquet. Some discolour their skins all over in this manner when they please, <HI>viz.</HI> they lay the <HI>Alkanna</HI> tempered in water on their Hands, or that part of the Body which they intend to colour, and binde it on with a String, that it may not fall off; this the Women do (for the most part) after Supper, before they go to Bed, that so the Colour lying on all Night, may make the better Impression in the Morning; the Paste being dry falls off, and leaves an Orange-tincture on the Skin; but if over-dawb'd, it makes them Red, or Black.</P>

<HEAD>Amfion or Opium, Thee, Coffee, and Tobacco.</HEAD>
<P>MOst <HI>Persians</HI> use <HI>Amfion</HI> or <HI>Opium,</HI> that is, Juice or Oyl of Poppy; by them call'd <HI>Offiuhn</HI> and <HI>Tiriak,</HI> (as the Berry <HI>Chas Cehask</HI>) and by the <HI>Turks</HI> onely, <HI>Maslac;</HI> which they making up in little Pills like Pease swallow: Those that use themselves to it, may take a quarter of an Ounce or more at a time: Some take it every other, or third day, onely to set them into an intoxicating Extasie, where they please themselves with strange Ima∣ginations. They are gathered in several Places of <HI>Persia,</HI> especially about <HI>Ispahan,</HI> after this man∣ner: The white Poppy being cut produces a milky Juice, which having stood a while, and be∣coming black, is taken and made fit to be used. The Druggists and Apothecaries make great ad∣vantage thereof. But <HI>Opium</HI> is not onely used much in <HI>Persia.</HI> but also in <HI>Turky,</HI> and <HI>India.</HI> It is also said, that some Women when their Husbands and they cannot agree, contrive their dispatch with a Dose of <HI>Opium.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coknar</HI> a sort of Drink, and the use there∣of.</NOTE> From the Husk or Shell the <HI>Persians</HI> also extract a Juice, which they call <HI>Coknar,</HI> much drunk by the Soldiers, especi∣ally in the time of <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> when they were forbidden to drink Wine; for it revives the Spi∣rits for the present, but is nothing so wholsome; for soon after their Bodies are so debilitated that they are unfit for Service; wherefore <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> prohibited upon pain of Death, either to make or fell this Liquor: Moreover all Vessels with this Liquor wherever they were found, were bro∣ken no, and stav'd immediatly before their Doors. But after all this, and the before mention'd first Law made by King <HI>Abbas,</HI> he preferring an Incon∣venience
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>before a Mischief, permitted the People to drink Wine again as formerly, in stead of <HI>Cocknar.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Take much Tobacco.</NOTE>They are great Takers of Tobacco, insomuch that People of all sorts and Degrees Smoak it in their Temples and other publick Places: They have it from <HI>Bagdad</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> and <HI>Curdistan,</HI> but so ill prepar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that they desire our <HI>European</HI> To∣bacco, which they call <HI>Inglis Tambacu,</HI> because the <HI>English</HI> bring the greatest quantities thither: They take it not as we do, but suck it through two Pipes joyn'd together; but first they take a Glass Bottle or <HI>Indian</HI> Nut, or a <HI>Cabach,</HI> which is a kind of Shell, that holds about a Pint, into which they put more or less (sometimes sweet) Water, leaving sufficient room for Smoak; then they put the two Pipes through the Mouth of the Bottle; the one contains the Tobacco in one Bowl, and through the other goes the Smoak; the end of one Pipe stands as far from the bottom, as the end of the other is from the Water, <HI>viz.</HI> about a Thumbs breadth.</P>

Rich Merchants who Trade in divers Places in the Countrey, make a great Convenience of it; having at their Coun∣trey-houses, and where else they Trade, not onely Furniture, but a Wife; so that where e're they come, they are still at Home.</P>
<P>They Marry their nearest Relations, but not so incestuously as of old they were wont to do; for in antient times (as <HI>Brissonius</HI> affirms out of several Writers) they commonly married their own Mothers, Sisters, or Daughters; but at this day none may marry so near in Blood. Moreo∣ver, it is accounted a horrid Sin, for any man to defile his Sister; which was not customary in <HI>Persia</HI> before <HI>Cambyses</HI> time; but grew very com∣mon after his marrying of his own Sister, which he lov'd exceedingly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Court∣ship.</NOTE>When a young man intends to marry, and hath an Affection for any Maid, then he informs him∣self by a second and third Person, of her Conditi∣on and Quality; for neither he, nor his Parents may see her: It she be to his minde, he sends two of his nearest Kindred, which were at his Cir∣cumcision, to the Maids Father, to acquaint him with his Love: To which, shewing some feign∣ed unwillingness to part with his Daughter; af∣ter short Enquiry, if liking the Match; he begins to treat about the Portion, which is not to be paid by the Brides Friends, but by the Bridegroom, or his Friends; for in <HI>Persia,</HI> as in all other Eastern-Countreys, they buy their Wives not ma∣king either Dowry or Joynture, neither recei∣ving Portions, but purchasing them at a Price, which is paid two several ways: for either the Bridegroom sends it to the Brides Fathers House a little before the Wedding, consisting in Pendants, Jewels, Armlets, or the like, which is a Reward to the Parents (who may either keep or give it again to their Daughter) for their careful breed∣ing up of the Bride; or else he makes over a cer∣tain Sum of Money, or a quantity of Silk-Stuffs, which she is oblig'd to return, if at any time they should part; to which purpose Writings are Drawn and Sign'd by a <HI>Cadi</HI> or <HI>Molla:</HI> After this Conclusion the Bride and Bridegroom chuse each of them a Trustee, who, if in a City, go to the <HI>Casi</HI> or Spiritual Judge, but if in a Village, to the <HI>Molla</HI> or Priest, impower'd by the <HI>Casi,</HI> and in the Bride and Bridegrooms Name (who appear not in Person, nor go to the Church to be Marry'd) de∣sire that they may be united, which the <HI>Casi</HI> (after being well assur'd of the Consent of the Parties) performs in the Name of <HI>God, Mahomet,</HI> and <HI>Aaly;</HI> and this is generally done by the foremention'd three Persons in a private place, either in a Cham∣ber or in the Fields.</P>
<P>Every one is free to Marry at any time in the year, except in the Moneth of <HI>Ramesan,</HI> or their <HI>Lent,</HI> and the ten days Mourning and Abstinence call'd <HI>Ashur.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cele∣brating of Matrimony.</NOTE>When the Wedding is to be celebrated, the Bridegroom sends the Bride the day before a pair of Pendants, Armlets, and other Ornaments, ac∣cording to his Capacity, and some Provisions. After Dinner, which generally is pretty late in the Evening, the Bride, set on a Horse, Camel, or Mule, with a red Silk Hood hanging down into her Lap, and accompany'd with all her Friends, Relations, and several sorts of Musick, is con∣ducted to the Bridegrooms House, where with some Women she is put into a peculiar Apart∣ment, and the Men into another, and Meat set be∣fore them, which when they have eaten, the Bride is soon after carry'd into the Bed-Chamber, and the Bridegroom being brought to her, there first at once enjoys both her Sight and Company, having never seen her before, and if he find her to have been vitiated, he may frely cut off her Nose and Ears, and turn her out of his Chamber; but if he find her a Virgin, he signifies his Joy to her old Nurse and to his Friends: Then they Feast three days one after another. They also use Dan∣cing, which is in Couples, but the Men by them∣selves in one Room, and the Women in another; the Musick never go into the Womens Cham∣ber, but stand and Play at their Door. In the Evening the Leaves of <HI>Alcanna,</HI> with which they color their Hands, are laid on a Cotton Handker∣chief, with two Spoonfuls of <HI>Alcanna;</HI> both which they take home with them: After which the Guests make Presents to the new Marry'd Couple, every one according to their Capacities.</P>

<P>After the Wedding is over, and that the New∣marry'd Couple dwell in the Brides Fathers house, the new Wife may not be seen with her Face un∣cover'd before her Father-in-Law, nor speak with him; but if occasion require, she is to ex∣press her mind by Signs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way to get women</NOTE>Besides their Marrying, they have another way to acquire a Companion to their Bed, <HI>viz.</HI> To hire them with a Sum of Money for a certain time; and is practised chiefly by those that travel from Place to Place, and by such as are not willing to be seen in the publick Stews.</P>
<P>A third way is by buying in the Market, slaves, with whom they may do what they please. These are commonly taken by the <HI>Tagestan Tartars,</HI> from the Christians in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and sold to the <HI>Persians.</HI> Nor is this Priviledge all allow'd onely to Men, for Women especially of Quality may as often change their Husbands as they please.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To help a wo∣man in Labor.</NOTE>When the Women are in labour, and cannot be suddenly deliver'd; then the Relations and Neighbors run to the Schools, and give the <HI>Molla</HI> money, to spare and forgive all those Schollars that have offended, and are condemned to be whipt; which they believe to be a great means to further her speedy Delivery: And for the same purpose, they think it very effectual to creep three or four times under a Camels belly.</P>
<P>If at any time, though without Cause, a Man suspect his Wife, they pass it not by, but take speedy and sharp Revenge; as appears by the following Relation.</P>
<P>Some years since, in the Province of <HI>Lenkeran,</HI> dwelt a Person nam'd <HI>Jakut Tirkenam,</HI> who was the Kings Bow-bearer; his Wife being reported to be of a loose behavior; at last <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> himself heard thereof, who order'd Notice to be given to the foremention'd <HI>Tirkenam,</HI> either to reform his House, or else to keep out of the King's Presence: Whereupon, he fearing to lose his Place, being of great Profit and Honor, made a real and thorow Reformation, by killing not one∣ly his Wife, but four Children; and all that re∣lated to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, to the number of twelve Persons; which though it seem barbarous to us, yet it pre∣serv'd his Reputation and Employment, with the King, his Master.</P>
<P>The Men likewise have the Power which they often execute, that if they catch any committing Adultery with their Wives, they may either im∣mediately kill both, or else bedivorc'd; and this last is very common.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Children very obedient.</NOTE>The Children are very obedient to their Pa∣rents; when a Father of Quality gives Audience in his own House; his Sons stay without, to con∣duct those that go out or in. These are not at the present brought up, as in antient times; <HI>viz.</HI> Lock'd up with the Women, without sight of their Fathers; for (according to <HI>Strabo</HI>) they might not before the fourth, or (as <HI>Herodotus</HI>) not before the fifth, and (as <HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> saith) not before the seventh year, be brought to the presence of their Fathers: But so soon as they can write and read, they put them to Trades, or to Study; for few amongst the <HI>Persians,</HI> though of the meanest Condition, but are taught to read and write.</P>

Then the Priest holding some Earth over the dead Body, reads another Chapter; then throws it on the Corps, and reads ano∣rher Chapter, and so goes home with the rest of the Company.

Three Trees full of red Apples were carry'd, and also three Locks of Hair of the Deceased's Wive's, who had cut or pull'd off the same in Sign of Mourning; and likewise several green and red Pieces of Paper. 11. The Body it self was carry'd by eight Persons; upon the Coffin lay a Silk-coat lin'd with <HI>Bucharian</HI> Sheep-skins. 12.

<P><HI>Texeira</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Persians</HI> call the twen∣tieth of <HI>March, Neuruz,</HI> that is, <HI>New-years-day;</HI> be∣cause they then begin the Account of their Year, which they make to contain three hundred sixty five Days, six Hours, 48 Minutes, and 53 Se∣conds; adding a Day to each fourth or fifth Year, since the time of <HI>Sultan Gelaleddin.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their diffe∣rent Years.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> reckon their Year two ways; the first is, that if <HI>Jezdagird</HI> or <HI>Yeztzird,</HI> Son to <HI>Shah∣riar</HI> the last <HI>Persian</HI> King after the Incursion of the <HI>Arabians</HI> into <HI>Persia.</HI> And this Account according to <HI>Uleg Beig</HI> commenc'd on a Tuesday, whereon he began his Reign.</P>
<P><HI>Albumazar</HI> affirms that the <HI>Persians</HI> reckon'd their Year to comprehend three thousand six hundred thirty four Days; which is ten Years, and ninety
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>four days after the <HI>Hegira,</HI> or flight of <HI>Mahomet</HI> from <HI>Mecha;</HI> but others do not begin it till after his Death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Account of their Years</NOTE>The beginning of <HI>Jezdagird</HI>'s Reign was in the eleventh Year of the <HI>Hegira,</HI> on the two and twen∣tieth of the first Moneth <HI>Rabbi,</HI> being the sixteenth of our <HI>June,</HI> Anno 632.</P>
<P>The other Account they call <HI>Gelasee,</HI> from the Name of Sultan <HI>Gelaleddin Meleck Sa Alb-Arselan,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Persia, Chorazan</HI> and <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> who commanded eight of the wisest Astronomers to rectifie the <HI>Persian</HI> Year;.

<P>This Year is call'd <HI>Senathi Gelali,</HI> that is, <HI>The Year of Majesty,</HI> or <HI>Neuruz Elsultani,</HI> that is, <HI>The Year of the Emperors,</HI> because it begins almost at their <HI>Lent-Eve.</HI> Moreover, we may easily com∣pute how many years they have of <HI>Jesdagird,</HI> by abstracting six hundred thirty two of our years; and of <HI>Gelasee,</HI> by abstracting a thousand and seventy nine.

<P>The Year is by the <HI>Persians</HI> divided into twelve Moneths, and (according to <HI>Ulug Beig</HI>) were for∣merly in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Fervardin, Ar∣dabahesht, Chordad, Tir, Mordad, Ram, Sharivar, Abru, Adar, Di, Behman,</HI> and <HI>Esfandermod.</HI></P>

<P>The beginning of <HI>Fervardin</HI> is generally call'd <HI>Neuruz;</HI> but the sixth day is properly <HI>Neuruz.</HI> The sixteenth of <HI>Mehermah</HI> is the common <HI>Meherjan.</HI> They say that <HI>GOD</HI> created the World in six days, which they call <HI>Cahenbarha.</HI></P>

<P>Of all these the <HI>Tscharschembe,</HI> or <HI>Wednesday,</HI> is accounted the most unfortunate. The last <HI>Wednes∣day</HI> of the Moneth <HI>Safar,</HI> or <HI>January,</HI> all <HI>Mahume∣tans,</HI> especially the <HI>Persians,</HI> account the most fatal day of the whole year, so that they will not go out of doors, nor permit any Person to visit them, and are most nicely circumspect in all things, and suspi∣cious least some Disaster should befall them. Moreover, the whole Moneth of <HI>Safar</HI> being esteem'd unfortunate, no one will venture to begin a Journey, or undertake any Business of conse∣quence.</P>
<P>They also put great confidence in the Plane∣tary Hours, and ascribe the twelve Hours to the twelve celestial Signs, <HI>viz.</HI> the first Hour on <HI>Sun∣day</HI> to <HI>Aries,</HI> and so of the rest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> highly esteem Books of <HI>Astrology,</HI> which they receiv'd from the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are great admirers of Astrology.</NOTE> who were famous in that Art, and are so addicted thereto, that a <HI>Minatzim</HI> may perswade them to undertake or forbear any thing, either out of hopes of future good, or fear of evil.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hakims</HI> generally spend their time in read∣ing Books of Physick and Astrology. Amongst these there are some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their For∣tune-tellers.</NOTE> that by casting Lots will foretell future Events; of which fort many have Booths on the <HI>Maidan</HI> or great Marker-place in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and are of two Qualities, <HI>viz. Remals</HI> and <HI>Falkirs.</HI> The <HI>Remals</HI> use six or seven Dice, strung on two Copper Wyres, and by the Casts thereof they Predict. The <HI>Falkirs</HI> go another way to work, for they have thirty or forty Chips of an Inch square lying before them, and written on the undermost side; on one of these they lay Money, and propose such Questions as the Inquisitor de∣sires to be resolv'd of; whereupon the Fortune∣teller takes up the Chip with the Money, and reads the words that are written under it; this done, he takes up a great Book, all the Leaves whereof are full of horrid Shapes, as Dragons, and all manner of Beasts and Animals painted, and muttering to himself, looks with an affrighted Countenance on the People; at last he turns over many Leaves to a certain Picture in the Book, and comparing the foremention'd Writing on the Chip therewith, resolves the propos'd Question.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ephe∣meris.</NOTE>They commonly in the beginning of the Year publish a Table of the Days, in the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Ephimerides,</HI> and in the <HI>Persian, Tacuin</HI> or <HI>Tackwin,</HI> which are not, as ours, made for many years; and though they be written, yet are they so numerous, that there is no Person but carries one of them in his Bosom, that he may be ready on all occasions, to know whether it be a good or bad Hour wherein they begin any Business of Conse∣quence:

<HEAD>Of their Poesie.</HEAD>
<P>POesie is here also highly esteem'd, for in most places are many <HI>Shaers</HI> or Poets (for <HI>Shaer</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue signifies a Poet, as <HI>Casiechuan</HI> an Orator) which compose Ver∣ses in Writing, but <HI>extempore,</HI> which they recite publickly in the <HI>Maidan</HI> or Market-place, or in Houses of Entertainment, for a small Reward, and are often invited to great Feasts by Persons of Quality, to make their Entertainment more so∣lemn by the rehearsal of their Poetical Fancies. <HI>Della Valle</HI> affirms, that they have some knowledge in Poetry, Morality, and Oratory, yet it is but su∣perficial, consisting onely in words, for they are very shallow of Invention, which is the most no∣ble part, and like the Soul of the whole Body.</P>
<P>The King, as also the <HI>Chans,</HI> have each their own Poets, which do not make themselves com∣mon in the Streets, but keep in their Houses, and make new Verses to delight their Lords, and if they chance to hit on a Subject pleasing to them, they are rewarded with great Presents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The difference of their Poets</NOTE>These Poets differ from other People in their Habit, for like the Philosophers they wear white under-Coats, open before, with broad and wide Sleeves, and a Bag by their Girdle, in which they carry their Paper and Inkhorn: Their Cloaks are without Sleeves, their Stockings short, and their Breeches run down sloaping to their Feet: In the Winter they wear Coats which reach down to their Ancles; but they never wear <HI>Turbants,</HI> onely Caps. Those that stand in the <HI>Maidans</HI> or Mar∣kets, tie a painted Cloth about their Bodies, which hang over their right Shoulder and under their left Arm, in which manner they read their Poetry; but these are not all to be suppos'd excellent, for some scarce deserve the Name of Rhimers; these may be seen venting their Froth in publick Hou∣ses and in the Market-places, to the illiterate Vul∣gar. But there are many excellent Copies of the ancient <HI>Persian</HI> Poets, as well in the <HI>Turkish</HI> as <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Language; for as they esteem both Tongues alike, so they read the <HI>Turks</HI> Poetry with as much pleasure as the <HI>Persian.</HI> The best Poets amongst them are distinguish'd by these Names, <HI>viz, Saadi, Hasis, Firdausi, Fussuli, Chagani, Eheli, Schems, Nawai, Schahidi, Deheki, Nessimi.</HI> Their Verses close almost after the <HI>German</HI> manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their method in Versifying.</NOTE> having re∣gard to like sounding words at the end of each Verse, but mind not the number of Feet. Some Verses are onely a few words, which being trans∣pos'd into several places, make the Verses divers; and to this purpose they often use such words as have a double signification; some end with the ending word of the former Line, as thus:</P>
<Q><L>Tzire, tzire, tzirag Janitze,</L>
<L>Adamira demag Janitze?</L>
<L>Tzire, tzire, tzirag Osteri bud?</L>
<L>Adamira demag Cheri bud.</L></Q>
<P>Some begin with the ending word, and end with the beginning word of the former Line, as in the following Verses:</P>
<Q><L>Kalem be dest Debira beh hasar derem,</L>
<L>Derem be dest neajed Meker nauk kalem.</L></Q>
<P>Here the second Verse begins with the word wherewith the first ended, and the last ends with the same with which the first begins; so that we may conclude, though they have a high conceit of themselves, yer we can discover nothing by this, but that they are very mean Poets.</P>

<HEAD>Lawyers and Physicians.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Few Lawyers here.</NOTE>THere are few Lawyers amongst the <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI> because they have onely a few written Laws, and those taken out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the Explanation and Practise whereof is wholly reserv'd to the <HI>Casi</HI> and <HI>Di∣wanbech.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they practise Phy∣sick.</NOTE>In matter of Physick they follow the Directi∣ons of <HI>Avicenna,</HI> and use for the most part the Pre∣scriptions of <HI>Galen.</HI> They also apply many things outwardly to their Patients, but without reason, as those that have inflam'd their Blood by drink∣ing too much of hot Liquors, they endeavor to cure by laying a great piece of Ice on their Bo∣dies, being of opinion, that the readiest Cure for all Diseases, is by contrary Applications.</P>
<P>If a Child or Woman falls sick, a Physician is not suffer'd to come to them, but onely a Nurse, who sends to the Doctor, and informs him of the state and condition of the Disease, who without more a do immediately prescribes Medicines, which are taken by the Patient with exceeding care.</P>
<P>They call all Physicians <HI>Hikim,</HI> that is. <HI>Wise,</HI> because of their Skill and Knowledge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Cure for the Head∣ache.</NOTE>About <HI>Casbin</HI> (as <HI>Olearius</HI> tells us) stands a large Tree, under which (they say) an old Saint lies bu∣ry'd, to which they make address for cure of the Tooth-ache, or other Aches or Pains; the man∣ner how as followeth:</P>
<P>The Persons affected coming to the Tree, drive a Nail into it, having first touch'd the grieved part therewith; then killing it, they make Offer∣ings, and give Alms to the Poor.</P>
<P>Their Paper differs not much from ours, being for the most part made of Cotton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Paper Ink, and Pens</NOTE> but sometimes of Silk, and polish'd with a Pumice Stone or smooth Shell, which makes it very free from Knots or Hairs, and as smooth as Glass.</P>

<P>Their Pens are not made of Quills like ours, but of Canes, which being brown, are somewhat thicker than ours; they are brought from <HI>Sciras</HI> and the <HI>Arabian Gulf,</HI> near which they grow in great abundance.</P>

<HEAD>Their Language.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Persians</HI> have a proper Language, yet in many things agreeing with the <HI>Ara∣bick,</HI> and divided into three Dialects, call'd <HI>Xirazy, Rostazy,</HI> and <HI>Harmazy;</HI> the first is the Court Language of <HI>Sciras;</HI> the second is us'd by the Gentry, but not so eloquent as the former; and the third is the vulgar, being of a harsh and un∣pleasant sound, and chiefly spoken in the Kingdom of <HI>Ormus.</HI> But besides this general Language, each Province hath a peculiar Speech, though most of them covet to speak the <HI>Turkish</HI> besides their own, but especially those that inhabit the Provinces heretofore possess'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> viz. <HI>Schirwan, Adirbeitzan, Erack, Bagdat,</HI> and <HI>Eruan;</HI> in which Places most Children are taught the <HI>Turkish</HI> Lan∣guage, but especially those that reside in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> and frequent the Court, and therefore they slight their native Tongue; and the reason hereof may be, because the <HI>Militia</HI> consists in <HI>Quizilbascies,</HI> most of which are natural <HI>Turks</HI> and the King's Slaves, though intermix'd with several Nations, which speak that Language, so that not onely the Officers, but also the King himself, who spends most of his time amongst them, is oblig'd to speak that Language, if he intends to be understood by, and convese with them; by which means it is common through all the Court: But the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue is us'd in all their Books and Writings, as also in all Obligations and Edicts publish'd by the King, and in all Matters of consequence and State Businesses.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language is esteem'd by the <HI>Persians,</HI> so is the <HI>Sclavonian</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Persian</HI> by the <HI>Indians;</HI> nay, it is at this day com∣mon through all the East, especially in the <HI>Mo∣gull</HI>'s Countrey, and from thence to <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The modern vulgar Tongue us'd by the <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI> is a confus'd Mixture, started up since <HI>Maho∣met</HI>'s time, from the several Nations which have harras'd and inhabited these Countreys.</P>

<P>The <HI>Greeks,</HI> according to the Testimony of <HI>Brissonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty to learn the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue.</NOTE> accounted the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue very hard to learn; but we suppose that the difficulty, if there be any, is in pronouncing the Letters, which are for the most part gutturals; but as <HI>John Gra∣vius</HI> and <HI>Olearius</HI> witness, there is not one of all the Eastern Tongues which require fewer Rules than the <HI>Persian,</HI> by reason of it's few <HI>Anomala:</HI> but the want of the Vowels makes great difficulty in the reading of their Books, for many Words with one and the same Consonants, onely with se∣veral Vowels, signifie several things; <HI>viz.

<P>One Word in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue, hath often∣times several significations, from whence many conclude that it is <HI>Lingua nuda,</HI> a barren Speech: As for Example from the word <HI>Chane,</HI> which pro∣perly signifies a House, there are many other words are deriv'd and compounded, <HI>viz.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Alpha∣bet.</NOTE>As to what concerns the Alphabet of the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI> they had antiently their own Letters and Characters; but after the <HI>Arabians</HI> had made themselves Masters of <HI>Persia,</HI> they were not onely laid aside, but upon their <HI>Califs</HI> Command all the Writings of that sort were burnt, for they judg'd that so long as the <HI>Persians</HI> kept the Books which contain'd the Laws and Religions of their Idols, they would never be brought to be good <HI>Mahume∣tans,</HI> so that the <HI>Arabians</HI> establish'd their Letters and manner of Writing, which the <HI>Persians</HI> affe∣cted so much, that they totally neglected their own, insomuch, that there is at this day not one amongst them that understands their own antient Letters.</P>
<P>All those that ever intend to speak the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue, must first be well experienc'd in the <HI>Ara∣bick;</HI> for the <HI>Persians</HI> not onely use <HI>Arabick</HI> words apart, but also joyn them to their Names; of which <HI>John Gravius, Lodowick de Dieu, Reyer</HI> and many others, treat more at large in their <HI>Persian</HI> Grammars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They study Philosophy.</NOTE>Notwithstanding there are not so many in <HI>Per∣sia</HI> as in <HI>Europe,</HI> which learn the Liberal Arts and Sciences, yet they highly esteem those that study therein, which they corruptly call <HI>Filosuf.</HI> The <HI>Persian</HI> Phylosophers in Matters of Phylosophy and other Sciences, highly esteem the Christian Books, especially such as treat of Morality, natu∣ral Phylosophy, and Religion: They also hold Disputations with great Confidence concerning the Mystery of their Religion, with People that are or another Opinion, quite contrary to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who out of stubborness will not admit any to speak thereof.</P>

Their chief Book is (as we said before) <HI>Culustan,</HI> that is, <HI>Rose-Valley,</HI> made by the famous Poet <HI>Schich Saadi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their chief Books.</NOTE> and some Years since Translated in∣to the <HI>German</HI> Tongue by <HI>Olearius;</HI> it consists not onely in pleasant Prose, but delightful Verses; and therefore every <HI>Persian</HI> hath this Book in his House; nay, some there are which carry it in their memory, and are therefore accounted very learned; this they repeat at all Feasts and other Merry-meetings.</P>

They have likewise several other Books, as Chronicles, as well of their own Kings Reigns and Wars, as other eminent Transactions; and these are term'd <HI>Mirchond, Emveri, Tzami, Walehi, Nussegri,</HI> and the like; a∣mongst which, the chiefest is <HI>Mirchond,</HI> who in an excellent Style hath written a <HI>Persian</HI> Chronicle in Four Volumes, which are there sold for two hundred Crowns; but we cannot credit the <HI>Per∣sians</HI> much in their Histories, and Matters of Reli∣gion, because they often mix fabulous Invention with real Truths.</P>
<P>The number of Books that treat of Philoso∣phy are but small in these Countreys, and those few are in the Hands of the most learned Persons who keep them as a great Treasure: The Books that are generally sold there, are either Roman∣ces or Verses treating of their Law, besides which, they have no Books worth mentioning.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They use ma∣ny Stratagems</NOTE>In former times the <HI>Persians</HI> always engag'd their Enemies on Horse-back, but since the use of Musquets was brought amongst them, they have made a Body of Foot, which in these last Wars hath done them great Service. Moreover they are very subtile in contriving Plots and Strata∣gems to circumvent their Enemies.</P>
<P>At the Siege of <HI>Iruan, Anno</HI> 1633. the <HI>Persians</HI> had a sort of Poyson in little Glasses which they shot with Darts into their Enemies Forts, by which means they so infected the Air, that it swell'd the Inhabitants Arms and Legs to an ex∣traordinary thickness, and by that means made them unable to resist. Their defensive Arms are Brest-plates, Shields, Coats of Mail, and Helmets.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soldiers of <HI>Persia</HI> made up of three Bodies.</NOTE>The Soldiers of <HI>Persia</HI> are made up of three sorts: The first sort are <HI>Turkomans,</HI> which are like Hirelings, and have <HI>Ziefs,</HI> that is, <HI>Pensions,</HI> which the Sons inherit from their Fathers, and are bound to furnish the King with a certain number of Horse as often as occasion shall require: The se∣cond sort is that which <HI>Leunclaivus</HI> and <HI>Soranzo</HI> call <HI>Corrises</HI> or <HI>Coridsches;</HI> but in the <HI>Turks</HI> Language might more properly be call'd <HI>Curchins</HI> or <HI>Georgi∣ans,</HI> which receive no pay, but have onely their Dyet, Horses, Apparel, Arms, Tents, and all o∣ther Necessaries. The third sort are Friends and Allies, <HI>viz. Armenians,</HI> and other <HI>Georgians</HI> who are Enemies to the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Four Degrees in their <HI>Mili∣tia.</HI></NOTE>In <HI>Persia</HI> are four Orders or Degrees in their <HI>Militia;</HI> the first are Musquetiers, or they that use Fire-arms, not many years since brought in by King <HI>Abbas,</HI> through the perswasions of Sir <HI>An∣thony Sherley,</HI> one of our three famous <HI>Sherleys,</HI> so much celebrated in former times.</P>
<P>All the Musquetiers are Natives and Inhabi∣tants of the Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Musquettiers.</NOTE> Towns, and Villages, though more dwell in the Villages than the Towns or Cities, and they are accounted <HI>Tat</HI> or ignoble, and may not wear the <HI>Tag,</HI> but the common <HI>Tur∣bant.</HI></P>
<P>Formerly they continually fought on Foot, yet march'd on Horseback like our Dragoons. All the Captains of these and other Companies are by a <HI>Turkish</HI> Name call'd <HI>Juzbassi;</HI> that is, The Head of a Hundred; for <HI>Juz</HI> is a Hundred, and <HI>Bassi</HI> the Head, notwithstanding they often have above two hundred, and sometimes under one hundred in their Companies.</P>
<P>Those that dwell in several Provinces or Pla∣ces, meeting at a general Rendezvouz, march to∣gether to the Army, either with the <HI>Chans</HI> of the Province, or else alone, especially those that have no <HI>Chans.</HI></P>
<P>Those of <HI>Mazanderan</HI> are accounted the best Mus∣quettiers, but there are more beside them whose number are always kept, and paid by the King, and are said to be twenty thousand.</P>
<P>The second Order is that of the Vassals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vaassls.</NOTE> or the Kings Servants, which are nobler than the Mus∣quettiers, and are all Christians by Extract, bought in their Infancy, or presented by several People, as <HI>Circassians, Georgians, Armenians,</HI> and the like: The <HI>Georgians</HI> who are the most numerous, are from Christians become <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> they fight all on Horse-back, and use several Weapons, as Spears, Bowes and Arrows, Musquets, Iron Clubs, crooked Swords, Daggers, and Battel-Axes.</P>
<P>The Kings Vassals are permitted to wear the <HI>Tag,</HI> and use the same on certain occasions, they have a peculiar Commander, and are to the num∣ber of fifteen thousand; <HI>viz.</HI> Those that belong to the King and are in his pay, for the <HI>Chans</HI> and Grandees keep many others in their own Service: Besides which there are fifteen thousand more which are no Soldiers, and officiate in several places at Court, or follow several employments, to which they are brought up from their Infancy.</P>
<P>Martial Law is also new, having been first esta∣blish'd by King <HI>Abbas,</HI> from the Example of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chisilbassi</HI> or Red Caps.</NOTE>The third Order consists in <HI>Chisilbassi,</HI> that is, Red Caps, and is more noble than that of the Vas∣sal; these also fight on Horse-back, carrying such Arms as they like best; in former times they us'd onely Bowes and Arrows, Shields and Swords, for they despis'd Guns as base Arms for a Gentleman to use; but since the Year 1620. they have all carry'd Fire-Arms, beside their old Weapons: Moreover some, especially Knights, keep their first Arms, which are less troublesome to carry than the other: They are free, and need not serve longer than they please or are paid; nay, they may change their Masters if they can make any advan∣tage thereby to themselves, they may leave the Kings Service and go to a <HI>Chan</HI> or <HI>Sultan,</HI> or from the one to the other, as it is very common.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Corci,</HI></NOTE>The fourth martial Order of the <HI>Persians</HI> being the most noble, is that of the <HI>Corci,</HI> call'd from the word <HI>Corma,</HI> which in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language signi∣fies to keep, who are in a manner like to our Life∣guards, because their office is to guard the King at Court, and all other Places.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Chizilbassi</HI> which neither serve the <HI>Chans</HI> nor <HI>Sultans,</HI> or any other people but the King him∣self, and are in his pay, are call'd <HI>Corci;</HI> the num∣ber whereof, amounts to twelve thousand; they use the same Arms as the other <HI>Chizilbassi;</HI> and fight on Horse-back; they have peculiar Com∣manders call'd <HI>Corcibassi;</HI> that is, Heads of the <HI>Cor∣ci:</HI> In these four Martial Orders the King's whole <HI>Militia</HI> consists, there being but few besides them.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are likewise the <HI>Jasakci,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Jasakci</HI> what Service they do.</NOTE> or Precursors, to clear the way for the Army, and detain all those they meet with, that they may

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Lasauls,</HI> what they are</NOTE>There are also others, as <HI>Lasauls,</HI> which are like Centinels, and have onely a Club or Staff in their hands; but these are rather Officers in the King's Court, than Soldiers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Titles of their Com∣manders.</NOTE>The supream General is call'd <HI>Sardar;</HI> a Com∣mander of ten or twelve thousand Bowe-men, <HI>Curtzschibacht;</HI> a Colonel over a thousand, <HI>Minbas∣chi;</HI> a Captain over a hundred, <HI>Jusbaschi;</HI> a Decu∣rion that commands ten, <HI>Ohubaschi;</HI> which if they have behav'd themselves valiantly, and perform'd any notable Exploit, they are without any respect of their Birth or Quality bountifully rewarded, and promoted to greater Dignity.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Enemies to <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE>The King hath powerful Enemies both on his right and left Hand, which oftentimes engage with him, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Zagatay,</HI> or the <HI>Usbecan Tartars</HI> in and upon the Borders of <HI>Chorasan,</HI> who many times invading him with ten or twenty thou∣sand Men, pillage all the Countrey: But the <HI>Turks</HI> are his greatest Enemies about <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Iruan,</HI> near which places many bloody Battels have been fought; the great <HI>Mogul</HI> also makes frequent War upon them for <HI>Candahar</HI> and <HI>Herat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boterus</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Sofi</HI> troubles himself but little with the Mogul; because between both Realms (as betwixt <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI>) are very narrow Passages, and the Situation of the Borders very Rocky and troublesome; by which means the conveying of Provisions that way, and the keeping of Forces there is very inconvenient.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Forces in pay.</NOTE>It is said, that King <HI>Abbas Anno</HI> 1620. kept con∣stantly one hundred thousand Horse in Pay, of which about thirty thousand guarded the Cities on the Frontiers, from whence they never stirr'd to a∣ny Engagement, onely when it was judg'd fit, then they are remov'd from one Quarter to another. Besides this numerous Army which receives Pay, are also many Voluntiers, persons of Quality, of which, some keep fifty, nay a hundred Men in their Service, which receive annual Revenues, and carrying Arms, are reckon'd amongst the <HI>Militia,</HI> as likewise Sutlers, Merchants, Handicrafts, Cam∣mel-drivers and Commissaries, which all bear Arms; besides their Wives which are no less in number than the Men, according to the antient Custom of the People of <HI>Asia,</HI> which (as <HI>Xenophon</HI> affirms) carry their Families with them to the Wars; so that the King's Army consisting as well of other men as Soldiers, amounts to between two and three hundred thousand Men.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Ispahan</HI> with the Villages belonging to the same, is able in a short time to raise sixty thousand Men besides the standing Forces.</P>
<P>The Soldiers marching in the Army observe a good Order, and make little noise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their order in marching.</NOTE> using neither Drums, Trumpets, nor any other Musical or War∣like Instruments; none daring to take any thing but what they pay for where ever they are Quar∣ter'd, by which means the Countrey-People re∣ceive great benefits by the Army's marching through their Towns or Villages, and the Mer∣chants or Handicrafts without any suspition of being wrong'd of their Goods, let the Soldiers have such things as they want, Sutlers travel with Fruit, Sweet-meats, and Snow in the midst of Summer, to such places where they expect the Army to come. For their better accommodation the Inhabitants of those Countreys in hopes of gain store up great quantities of all manner of Provision against the time that they expect the Army to come thither, where they dispose of them at their own Rates, which is not ordinary. The Pay which a Trooper receives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pay.</NOTE> amounts yearly to five <HI>Tomans,</HI> each <HI>Toman</HI> is sixteen Crowns, with which he may maintain himself ve∣ry handsomly there; the Officers pay is either more or less according to their places.</P>
<P><HI>Olearius</HI> tells us that the yearly pay of a private Soldier, <HI>viz.</HI> of a <HI>Curtschi</HI> or Bow-man, is three hundred Crowns, with which he must maintain himself and his Horse, and that of a <HI>Tufenktschi</HI> is two hundred.</P>
<P>The pay allow'd certain persons of Quality exceeds all the rest, and extends to two or three hundred <HI>Tomans</HI> a year; these also maintain whole Companies at their own Charge; not∣withstanding these Grandees are listed but as private Soldiers in the King's Book.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Persian</HI> Soldiers which receive the Kings pay, are oblig'd to be ready upon his Command, and if need require, immediately to go to such places as they are call'd to.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No orderly Discipline in Battels.</NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> observe no order of Marshalling their Forces in Field Battels, the King onely pla∣cing the <HI>Chans</HI> over the <HI>Sultans,</HI> and other Com∣manders according to the number of men which they have under them. The Office of a Cap∣tain is onely to guard the place where he is ap∣pointed.

<HEAD>Their Coyn.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their several sorts of Mo∣ney.</NOTE>THe currant Money in <HI>Persia</HI> is Silver and Copper.

<P>An <HI>Abascy</HI> is about a Crown in value, though not above a quarter of an Ounce in weight. These <HI>Abascies</HI> have their Denomination from <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> who caus'd them to be Coyn'd, as also the half <HI>Abas;</HI> and the <HI>Chodabendes,</HI> because <HI>Schach Chodabende</HI> was the first maker of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Schahis</HI> make each a quarter of an <HI>Abas,</HI> and two <HI>Bisties</HI> and a half, being the least Silver Coyn, one <HI>Abascy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Laryns</HI> or <HI>Lari,</HI> are two pieces of Silver of a certain weight, bow'd together in two parts, and stamp'd at the end with the Governor of <HI>Lar</HI>'s Arms, and hath its Name from the City or Do∣minion, or from the Princes of <HI>Lar,</HI> when they were absolute, and not subject to the Kings of <HI>Persia.</HI> And because the value of this Coyn con∣sists onely in the weight and goodness of the Sil∣ver, it passes currantly through all the Eastern Countreys, and not onely allow'd by the <HI>Chans</HI> and Princes of <HI>Lar,</HI> who first Coyn'd it, but by all the Princes of <HI>Asia:</HI> for the <HI>Turks, Persians, Mo∣gulls,</HI> and others, Coyn the same with their pro∣per Names. But after the uniting of the Duke∣dom of <HI>Lar</HI> with the <HI>Persian</HI> Realm, this Coyn hath much declin'd, as <HI>Olcarius</HI> affirms. In former times they had another Coyn call'd <HI>Lari,</HI> which was of bended Silver Plate, beaten out, and stampt in the middle.

<P>Their Copper Money is in general call'd <HI>Pul,</HI> and in particular <HI>Casbechi,</HI> of which forty make an <HI>Abascy.</HI></P>
<P>Each great City hath its peculiar Copper Coin, which goes in no other Place, and no longer than one year, because the Stamp is alter'd every year. The Coyn of one City is mark'd with a Deer, and of another with a Goat, Satyr, Fish, Serpent, or whatever they fancy. Moreover, against their new Year, which happens in <HI>February,</HI> the old <HI>Casbechies</HI> are either call'd in, or cry'd down, after which two are not worth one, and are forc'd to be brought to the Mint again, where they are beaten out and stamp'd anew. A Pound of Copper is sold here for one <HI>Abas,</HI> of which they make sixty <HI>Casbechies.</HI></P>
<P>They have also <HI>Xerafs,</HI> or <HI>Xerafies,</HI> or <HI>Xerafins,</HI> of Gold, which make eight <HI>Laryns;</HI> and likewise Deniers, which are about one <HI>Spanish</HI> Ducat and a half apiece. But <HI>Texeira</HI> doth not clear this Point, because in one place he saith, that a Million of Gold Deniers makes almost twelve Millions of <HI>Spanish</HI> Ducats, and in another place, that fif∣teen hundred Deniers are near upon two thou∣sand <HI>Spanish</HI> Ducats; and in another place, that fifty thousand Deniers are about seventy thou∣sand <HI>Spanish Ducats.</HI> But a <HI>Xerafin</HI> is by the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> on the Island <HI>Ceylon,</HI> accounted to be four Shillings.</P>
<P>Others affirm, that the Coyns in <HI>Persia</HI> are <HI>Be∣sorchs, Pays, Soudy, Chay, Mamoudy, Laryn,</HI> and <HI>To∣mams.</HI> Ten <HI>Besorchs</HI> make a <HI>Pays,</HI> which is Cop∣per, and made like a <HI>Dutch</HI> Doit; four <HI>Pays</HI> a <HI>Chay,</HI> or Four-pence-halfpeny <HI>English;</HI> twenty <HI>Pays</HI> a <HI>Mamoudy,</HI> or Nine-pence <HI>English;</HI> twenty five <HI>Pays</HI> a <HI>Laryn,</HI> five <HI>Laryns</HI> a Crown, and a hundred <HI>Mamoudies</HI> a <HI>Tomam,</HI> which is sixteen Crowns.</P>

At <HI>Ban∣der-Gamron</HI> the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> have their Facto∣ries, as also in <HI>Lar</HI> and <HI>Ispahan.</HI> The <HI>Persian</HI> Trade being very considerable to the <HI>Holland East-India</HI> Company, doth not a little add to their Gain from the <HI>Indian</HI> Commodities: for the Trade which the said Company drives from the Island <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> to <HI>Persia,</HI> is not onely for the utterance of their Pepper, Cinamon, Carda∣mom, and other Commodities, which are Trans∣ported to <HI>Persia,</HI> and turn to a good Account; but chiefly for the ready Money which they carry from <HI>Persia</HI> to <HI>Ceylon;</HI> for they Import yearly unto <HI>Persia</HI> about eight hundred thousand Pound weight of Cardamom, seventy thousand of <HI>Japan</HI> Wood, and between twenty and thirty thousand of Ci∣namon.</P>

But they are not the onely Traders there, for the <HI>Banians, Moors,</HI> and other Eastern People, supply their Markets with the like Merchandise.</P>
<P>For the promoting of Trade in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> the <HI>Hol∣landers</HI> are forc'd every year to make great Pre∣sents to the King and his Courtiers, who believe that they are oblig'd thereto, if they receive but a Grant to buy thirty or forty <HI>Cara's,</HI> or such incon∣siderable quantities of Silk, from peculiar Per∣sons (for else they are bound to Deal onely with the King for their Silk) which they Transport without paying any Custom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> having a Factory on the Island of <HI>Barain,</HI> receive half the Custom there, as also divers Sums of Money of all <HI>Moorish</HI> Vessels, and <HI>Arabian</HI> Pearl-Ketchers, extending their Trade into the <HI>Persian</HI> Bay near <HI>Bassora, Congo, Bander-Gamron, Cabo de Jaques,</HI> and several other Places.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants and Foreigners may travel whither they please, and Trade to all Places, pay∣ing onely the Custom, and some small Imposts to the Crown.</P>
<P>But this is of special remark, that by virtue of an Agreement made between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per∣sians,</HI> they drive an unmolested Trade both in or out of the Countrey, as well in times of War as Peace; the <HI>Caravans</HI> travelling from place to place without any disturbance, to the great advantage of both Countreys.</P>

<HEAD>The King's Revenues.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's yearly Reve∣nues.</NOTE>THe yearly Revenues of the Kings of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> are said to amount to twenty Millions of our Money: for not onely the Towns and Provinces pay great Tributes, but also the Customs, Taxes, and Presents, amount to a consi∣derable Sum.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs ta∣ken off in Trade from Port to Port, and of what paid.</NOTE><HI>Schach Thamas</HI> was the first King that took off the Customs formerly paid for the Transporting of Commodities from one Place to another, being Farm'd for above a hundred thousand <HI>Tomans</HI> yearly, each <HI>Toman</HI> being sixteen Crowns; but afterwards he commanded them onely to pay the bare Fees of what Goods were Exported or Im∣ported; so that most of his Revenues came from the Lands, Woods, Vineyards, and Fruits, of which he had a seventh part of the Product. They also paid for their Cattel, <HI>viz.</HI> for forty Sheep, fifteen <HI>Bisties</HI> yearly; and for each Cow, ten. Besides which, the <HI>Christians</HI> paid from Five to Eight in the Hundred, according to the good∣ness of the Lands possess'd, and Trade which they drove.

The <HI>Armenian Christians,</HI> of which there are many thousands in the Countrey, pay two Dol∣lars apiece.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The form of Noblemens Houses.</NOTE>THe Houses of Noblemen are for the most part large, containing many Apartments, fitted for several uses; each Room is built alone in a handsom form, and separate from the rest, so that you need not go out of one into an∣other, as is usual here, but directly to that where you are design'd. The Houses (according to the Eastern manner) have no Windows towards the Street, are flat Roof'd, and have very little Doors of one intire piece of Marble, unpolish'd, and of an unhandsom shape, for all the <HI>Asian</HI> People take but little care to beautifie their Houses on the out∣side. The Rooms of Entertainment are generally open before like Galleries, and look either into Gardens, or other spacious Walks. At the far∣ther end of the Hall, opposite to the Entrance, is an Apartment cover'd on the top with glaz'd Tyles; so also is the Floor and Walls, but the last not above four Foot high, that those that sit on the Ground may lean against them with their Backs. After the same manner the Kitchin Walls and Floor are also Pav'd; in the Floor are several round Holes, into which putting Fire, they either stew or bake Meat, or keep it hot. The Fire be∣ing under the Floor like a Stove, you can neither perceive Smoak nor Flame, because the Smoak hath a peculiar place to go out at. Under these round Holes are little Springs, which spouting up, the Water is receiv'd in Troughs, and serves to wash their Meat with, as also for other occasions, after which it runs away through private Drayns.</P>
<P>The Houses are but indifferently Furnish'd, ha∣ving neither Chests of Drawers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Furni∣ture.</NOTE> Cabinets, Tables, Chairs, Stools, or other Lumber, as is usual a∣mongst us, but onely Carpets, Cushions, Mats, Quilts, and the like, to sleep and sit upon. The Floors of the Lodging Rooms are cover'd with very fine Carpets, on which they sit and walk without their Shoes, eitheir when they talk one with another, or eat together, and also sleep on them. In these Chambers no Dogs are suffer'd to enter; and to keep them clean, they have always a <HI>Tuftan</HI> or empty Platter standing by them, into which they throw all their Bones, Shells, and the like. These <HI>Tuftans</HI> are much us'd at Meals, being set betwixt every two Persons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caravansera's</HI> what they are.</NOTE>There are likewise two kind of Buildings in <HI>Persia,</HI> call'd <HI>Caravansera's,</HI> which are erected at the King's Charge, the first up and down in the High-ways, for the accommodation of Tra∣vellers, and the others in the Towns, for Mer∣chants Goods: Those which are in the Countrey are common Inns, and built like Cloysters, <HI>viz.</HI> with a spacious Court in the middle, and many Chambers round about. As to what concerns the Place it self, any one may dwell therein a whole year and not pay any thing for his Lodging. Those which are in the Towns, and serve for Store-houses, have many large Rooms, on the Doors whereof hang great Padlocks. In these the Merchants keep their several Goods for very small Rent, which is bestow'd upon Locks. In these Rooms are nothing but the bare Walls. He that comes first thither makes choice of as many empty Chambers as he hath occasion for, and for as long time as he intends to stay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sum∣mer-houses.</NOTE>In the Villages, especially between <HI>Eskerf</HI> and <HI>Ferhabad,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Mazanderan,</HI> are di∣vers Summer-houses built against the heat of the Sun, which are call'd <HI>Balachane,</HI> consisting of high Poles, cover'd both on the tops and sides onely with Mats made of thin Reeds, which they use like Curtains, rolling them up, or letting them down, according as they find it for their conveni∣ence. They go not up to these <HI>Balachanes</HI> by Steps, but on a piece of Timber, which lies sloap∣ing, and at easie distances hath several Notches to set their Feet on in stead of Stairs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses like Beehives.</NOTE>The Roofs of the Houses in the Villages <HI>Aran∣zague</HI> and <HI>Polesofium,</HI> are round on the top like a Bee-hive, after the manner of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Huts and Tents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of making Fires.</NOTE>In <HI>Ispahan</HI> and other places, where there is but little Wood, and likewise through all <HI>Curdistan,</HI> necessity hath taught the Inhabitants a means to keep themselves warm in Winter in their Houses, <HI>viz.</HI> they make a Hole in the Earth, which they call <HI>Tenur</HI> or <HI>Tennor,</HI> whereinto they put burning Coals; over it they set a kind of Table with a broad Carpet upon it, about which setting them∣selves, they cover half their Bodies with the Car∣pet, and also sleep about it in the Night: It warms a Room very considerably with a few Coals; and for conveying away the Smoak, Pipes are laid un∣der Ground from the <HI>Tenur</HI> to the Garden or base Court. The Fewel which they burn is according to the nature of what the Countrey affords, ei∣ther Wood and Shrubs, or else Cows and Camels Dung.</P>
<P>Amongst the Nobility in the <HI>Diwanchane,</HI> or places of Audience, are us'd long Wax-Candles, which weigh about three pound apiece, and serve three or four Evenings, the remaining Ends being us'd in other places that are not so much fre∣quented.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Candles and other Lights.</NOTE>They also burn Tallow in Candlesticks, made of Silver or other Metal like Lamps; under which is plac'd a Bason or Platter, to receive that which drops down, that it may not fall on the Carpets.</P>
<P>They also use round Iron Fire-pans, in which they burn old Rags dipt in Grease, which kind∣ling instantly, give a greater light than our Links or Torches. These Pans they commonly carry about on Sticks, which serve them in stead of <HI>Flambeaux;</HI> they sometimes set them on Poles in the open Air before the <HI>Diwanchane;</HI> nor may they be carry'd in the Night before any other than Persons of the greatest Quality.

<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> as well as the <HI>Turks</HI> call them∣selves <HI>Muselmans,</HI> from the <HI>Arabick</HI> word <HI>Salama,</HI> which signifies <HI>Releasing</HI> or <HI>Freeing,</HI> and was first impos'd or assum'd, because when <HI>Mahomet</HI> first set afoot his Doctrine, all those were put to Death that would not declare their Belief in the follow∣ing words: <HI>La Ilah Illa Alah, Muhammed Resul, Allah,</HI> that is, <HI>There is no other but one onely God, and Mahomet his Prophet.</HI> Upon this Declaration the Remonstrants were released, and call'd <HI>Musel∣man;</HI> but now they call the Children as soon as they are Circumcis'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cir∣cumcision.</NOTE> <HI>Muselman:</HI> Their Youths they Circumcise in the seventh, eighth and ninth year, at which time they inebriate them with sweet Liquors, that they may not feel the pain: They not onely Circumcise the Males, but also use a Ceremony signifying the Circumcision of Females; but the <HI>Turks</HI> onely cause their Daugh∣ters to lift up their Hands and speak some certain words.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherein the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> dif∣fer or agree.</NOTE>In this Matter and the <HI>Alcoran</HI> the <HI>Persians</HI> agree with the <HI>Turks,</HI> but differ in several others, as 1. Their Expositions and Explanations of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> are not the same. 2. Their <HI>Imams</HI> or Saints are different. 3. Their Ecclesiastick Cere∣monies and Customs are several. 4. The Mira∣cles wrought by their Saints are repugnant to each other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> also differ from the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> in many other things: for the <HI>Persians</HI> af∣firm, that God is the cause of all Good, and the Devil of all Wickedness; which the <HI>Turks</HI> deny, saying, That then we should have two Gods, one good and the other bad. The <HI>Persians</HI> believe that God is immortal, but that the Soul of Man, as well as of other things, is mortal: On the con∣trary the <HI>Turks</HI> hold, That the Glory of the Law is a Work of God, and that all God's Works are without beginning or end, as likewise the God∣head. The <HI>Persians</HI> affirm, That the Souls of the Good in the other World do not behold God in Essence, because he is a Spirit, but onely see his Glory, Mercy, Goodness, and the like, which are his Attributes: But the <HI>Turks</HI> say, That the Souls of the Blessed see God as he really is. The <HI>Per∣sians</HI> also say, That when <HI>Mahomet</HI> receiv'd the Law from Heaven which he was to publish to the World, his Soul onely was by the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> carry'd to God: But the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> say, that not onely his Soul but his Body also appear'd before God. The <HI>Persians</HI> reckon the Sons of <HI>Aaly</HI> and <HI>Fatime,</HI> and their twelve Nephews, the most eminent of all Prophets, except <HI>Mahomet:</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> allow them Prophets, but deny that they exceed others. The <HI>Persians</HI> judge it suffici∣ent to worship God three times a day, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Morning at the rising of the Sun, which they call <HI>Sob;</HI> at Noon, which they name <HI>Dor;</HI> and in the Evening when the Sun sets, by them styl'd <HI>Ma∣garib:</HI> But the <HI>Turks</HI> Pray five times a day, <HI>viz.</HI> in the three foremention'd times of the <HI>Persians;</HI> and beside these, a little before the Sun sets, which time they call <HI>Hacer,</HI> and likewise when they go to Bed. The <HI>Persians</HI> chiefest Prayer is the <HI>Fa∣tah</HI> and <HI>Alhemdo Lilla,</HI> which Translated is to this effect: <HI>Praise be to God, the Lord of Creatures,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Persian</HI> Prayer.</NOTE> <HI>and the King of Judgment: We honor thee; on thee our Aid we call: Lead us in the right way, in the right way of those whom thou hast done good unto, but not in the way of those against whom thou art incens'd, nor in the way of such as go astray. Amen.</HI> Moreover, all the Chapters in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> begin with these words: <HI>Bismilla Rahman Rahin,</HI> that is, <HI>In the Name of God, Gracious and Merciful.</HI> So likewise in all their Actions they have the word <HI>Bismilla</HI> in their Mouths: No Linnen Draper will measure out an Ell of Callico, nor a Shoemaker set Stitch in a Shoe, but first he repeats the word <HI>Bismilla,</HI> and sometimes also <HI>Benam Oukinamesch Herestzane∣haft,</HI> that is, <HI>In the Name of him who is the Protector of Souls.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> diffe∣rent Ceremo∣nies in prepa∣ring them∣selves to pray¦er.</NOTE>When the <HI>Persians</HI> prepare themselves to pray∣er, first they wash themselves, but not like the <HI>Turks,</HI> for they making bare their Arms above the Elbows, first wash their Hands which they stroak twice down from their Elbows to their Fingers, and with their right Hand onely wash themselves twice over the Face, whereas the <HI>Turks</HI> rub their Face with both hands, and stroak their Arm three times upwards and three times downwards, and also wash their Mouths and Nose.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> with their wet hands stroke twice over their Heads, from their Necks to their Fore∣heads, and afterwards cross their feet to their Ancles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> pick their Ears with their foremost Finger, and rub round them with their Thumbs, then scratch the Nape of their Neck over their Heads to their Throats, these Ceremonies are perform'd at Home before their going to Church.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> oftentimes in their Praying hold before their Foreheads a made Stone consist∣ing of a greyish Earth, digg'd up near <HI>Cufa,</HI> where <HI>Hossein</HI> is imagin'd to have been bury'd with <HI>Aaly</HI> his Father, from whence the Stone have great Power; It's eight square, about four Inches over, in the middle thereof in a Circle, are written the Names of the foremention'd twelve <HI>Imams,</HI> with that of <HI>Fatima Aaly</HI>'s principal Wife, of whom the <HI>Imams</HI> sprang.</P>
<P>These Stones are made by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who bring them to sell amongst the <HI>Persians.</HI> But the <HI>Turks</HI> esteem them not, entring in the <HI>Mosque,</HI> they begin the Prayer of <HI>Aaly Ekber:</HI> The <HI>Persians</HI> let their Hands hang downwards, and cast their Eyes on the Ground; but the <HI>Turks</HI> keep their hands on their brests: Moreover the <HI>Persians</HI> lay their Hands on both Ears and turn their Faces to <HI>Kible,</HI> that is, the South, because <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina</HI> are opposite to <HI>Adirbeitzan</HI> and <HI>Ardebil,</HI> lying towards the South, which when the <HI>Persians</HI> respect they begin their <HI>Ahlhemdo Lilla,</HI> and holding their Hands on their Knees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pray∣ers.</NOTE> stand bent and pray the <HI>Subhanna Rebbi, &amp;c.</HI> repeat the <HI>Alla Ekber;</HI> then kneeling on the ground they strike their Heads on the foremention'd Stone, and say the <HI>Subhanna Rebbi</HI> again, after which they hold up their Hands, this done they repeat their last Prayer kneeling, then rising up they turn to the right side, saying to themselves <HI>Ssalom alecum Ssalom alecum;</HI> with which words they salute the Guardian that hath stood by them and defended them from the De∣vil that he should not disturb them in their Devo∣tion, as if he were present.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence this difference pro∣ceeds.</NOTE>This difference in Religion between the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> is said to proceed from this Cause, <HI>viz. Mahomet</HI> on his Death-bed made his Brother and adopted Son <HI>Aaly</HI> (for he was espous'd to <HI>Fa∣tima</HI> Daughter to his first Wife <HI>Cadie</HI>) to be his Successor, (as the <HI>Persians</HI> affirm) not onely in the Dominion of Spiritual, but worldly Affairs; gi∣ving him the Title of <HI>Calif.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Arabians</HI> say, that <HI>Abubeker, Omar,</HI> and <HI>Odsman,</HI> being great amd mighty Lords, and in high esteem with <HI>Mahomet,</HI> took the Government upon them alternately after his Death, alledging that he had so commanded them; which <HI>Aaly</HI> and his Friends judg'd not onely untrue, but un∣just; and therefore oppos'd them, but at length was forc'd by reason of his inconsiderable strength to submit to <HI>Abubeker, Omar,</HI> and <HI>Odsman</HI>'s Propo∣sals; nay, to be contented to see himself berea∣ved of his whole Inheritance. But <HI>Abubeker</HI> not long after dying, <HI>Omar</HI> succeeded, who being kil∣led by his Slave, a <HI>Persian,</HI> made room for <HI>Odsman,</HI> who was also slain by a Soldier belonging to <HI>Aaly,</HI> who on the same day that <HI>Odsman</HI> dyed, was made <HI>Calif.</HI></P>
<P>After a Reign of four years and two hundred sixty two days, <HI>Aaly</HI> was kill'd as he was going to Morning Prayer, by <HI>Abdurahman,</HI> Son to <HI>Melgjem,</HI> and his Body bury'd at <HI>Tuhafa</HI> or <HI>Cufa,</HI> in a Castle. On the same day his Son <HI>Hossein</HI> was made <HI>Calif,</HI> but he resign'd his Dominion to one <HI>Muavias,</HI> and dy'd in the sixth year and fifth day of his Reign; they say that his Wife by the Instigation of <HI>Mua∣vias</HI> poyson'd him: But <HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us that <HI>Hossein</HI> was by his Antagonists (which are ban∣nish'd by the <HI>Persians</HI> as Vagabonds) set upon in the High-way, and kill'd with his whole Retinue of seventy or eighty men, <HI>viz.</HI> In a place in wild <HI>Arabia,</HI> call'd <HI>Kierbula,</HI> where his Tomb is yet to be seen, and highly honor'd and visited by many <HI>Mahumetans</HI> which come thither from Remote Countreys, who account him a Martyr and a great Saint, nay, the true <HI>Imam,</HI> and the <HI>Sophy</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> himself boasts that he was lineally descended from him. Moreover, many to honor themselves as∣sume the name of <HI>Hossein-culi,</HI> that is, <HI>Hossein</HI>'s Slaves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Original of <HI>Scheich Sofi</HI></NOTE>In this posture Affairs continued till the year 1343. at which time a learned man call'd <HI>Sofi</HI> or <HI>Scheich Sofi,</HI> started up in the City of <HI>Ardebil;</HI> who boasted that he was the Successor of <HI>Aaly,</HI> as being extracted from <HI>Musai Casim,</HI> one of the twelve Sons of <HI>Hossein.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Sofi</HI> gave many Testimonies of great Holi∣ness and prudence, and therefore caused himself
<PB N="69" REF="62"/>to be nam'd <HI>Schich</HI> or <HI>Scheich,</HI> liv'd a reserv'd Life seeming to despise the World and the glory ther∣of; went cloth'd in a Sheep-skin, and never would put on a Garment of Silk, but onely of Wool, from whence some suppose, because <HI>Suf</HI> in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue signifies Wool, he receiv'd that Denomination of <HI>Sofi.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Schich Sofi</HI> began to teach in publick, that the Succession in the place of <HI>Calif</HI> belong'd right∣ly to <HI>Aaly:</HI> as being <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s adopted Son, and accordingly his true Heir; and that <HI>Abubeker, Omar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Doctrine and Opinion.</NOTE> and <HI>Odsman</HI> had unjustly depriv'd <HI>Aaly</HI> and his whole Family of that Honor, to the great dishonor of <HI>Mahomet</HI> himself, which had exceed∣ingly enrag'd God, and made him to awake <HI>Sofi,</HI> and endue him with ability to regain <HI>Aaly</HI>'s Right, which had so long been trampl'd under foot: And as a Sign that <HI>Aaly</HI> was a true Prophet, <HI>Sofi</HI> related many Miracles wrought by him, which the <HI>Turks</HI> had kept in obscurity.</P>
<P>In the next place he declar'd that <HI>Aaly</HI> made an exact Explanation of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which he left to his Successor <HI>Tzaferfadack</HI> in Manuscript.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> being a People much inclin'd to Novelties, easily embrac'd <HI>Sofi</HI>'s Doctrine, espe∣cially certain <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Slaves, who thereby obtain'd their Freedom, by which he got so great an Esteem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are ge∣nerally em∣brac'd and re∣ceiv'd.</NOTE> that they all turn'd to <HI>Scheich Sofi,</HI> as their Redeemer and Protector: By this means he soon perswaded them to his Opinion, and thereby increas'd the Number of his Followers. Whereupon he commanded his Doctrine and Ceremonies, to be observ'd in the <HI>Mosques,</HI> which being somewhat contrary to the <HI>Turks,</HI> they be∣gan to rage exceedingly against him, and perse∣cute the <HI>Persians</HI> with Fire and Sword; who nevertheless, promoted <HI>Alay,</HI> and added to their Articles of Faith, these Words, <HI>Aaly Welli Alla. There is no other but the onely God,</HI> Mahomet <HI>his Pro∣phet, and</HI> Aaly <HI>his Successor and General:</HI> Nay, they stick not to say that though <HI>Aaly</HI> be not the God∣head himself, yet he was as one of the Almighty's Brothers: That the <HI>Alcoran</HI> which God design'd to give to <HI>Aaly,</HI> was by a Mistake deliver'd to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in which Saying they prefer him before <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and the Clark standing on the top of the <HI>Mosque,</HI> at the time when he calls the Peo∣ple thither, speaks aloud to this effect: <HI>Curs'd be</HI> Abubeker, Omar, <HI>and</HI> Odsman, <HI>God be merciful to</HI> Aaly. They also have a deriding Proverb, <HI>viz. Kiriseck der deheni Abubeker, Omar, Hanife bat;</HI> That is, <HI>A Dogs T— in</HI> Abubeker<HI>'s Teeth;</HI> which to the <HI>Turks</HI> seems so great an abomination, that it makes them exceeding inveterate against the <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another ground of dif∣ference.</NOTE><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us that the greatest differences between the <HI>Persians</HI> and other <HI>Mahumetans</HI> pro∣ceeded from this occasion, <HI>viz.</HI> When <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his last Expedition with his Army between <HI>Me∣dina</HI> and <HI>Mecha,</HI> riding upon a Camel before all his Followers, taking <HI>Aaly</HI> by the Hand, com∣manded him to get up behind him; saying to his People, <HI>Those that have had me for their</HI> Veli, <HI>shall also have</HI> Aaly <HI>my adopted Son.</HI> The word <HI>Veli</HI> in the <HI>Arabick</HI> hath two significations, and may be ta∣ken either for the Chief or Head of a Church or for a Friend or Favorite <HI>Aaly</HI> and his Suc∣cessors believ'd the first signification, and ever since maintain'd that <HI>Mahomet</HI> by this Saying chose <HI>Aaly</HI> to succeed him, as well in the Government of Spiritual as Temporal Affairs, and that by the Power of this Declaration, <HI>Aaly</HI> and his Successors ought for ever to be the Governors of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Race; but after <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Death a Will was brought forth, wherein <HI>Abubeker Mahomet</HI>'s Fa∣ther-in-Law (for <HI>Mahomets</HI> last Wife <HI>Aisne,</HI> was <HI>Abubeker</HI>'s Daughter) was nam'd Heir and <HI>Califa,</HI> or spiritual and worldly Successor; which Will was made by the Practice of <HI>Aisne,</HI> or as the <HI>Persians</HI> say, forg'd by her; but the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Ara∣bians</HI> say that <HI>Mahomet</HI> himself chang'd his opini∣on, because <HI>Aaly</HI> was too yong and unexperienc'd; whereas <HI>Abubeker</HI> was aged, and a man of prudence and good conduct; so that they conclude that <HI>Mahomet</HI> by the foremention'd discourse never in∣tended to make <HI>Aaly</HI> his Heir or Successor, but onely to make known to him that they should shew the like respect arid honor to <HI>Aaly,</HI> as they had done to him; And in truth they do little less, for they reverence <HI>Aaly</HI> as a great Saint, and account him the chief Head of their Religion; nay, for the true <HI>Calif</HI> or Successor of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> though not the first immediately after him, as the <HI>Persians</HI> relate, but the fourth in order, <HI>viz.</HI> after <HI>Abubeker, Omar</HI> and <HI>Odsman.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A great Feast in Honor of <HI>Aaly.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Persians</HI> celebrate yearly that Day of the Moneth, on which <HI>Mahomet</HI> chose his adopted Son <HI>Aaly</HI> to be his Successor, as a great Feast, and call it the <HI>Sheep roasted.</HI></P>
<P>Now in regard the <HI>Persians</HI> promote <HI>Aaly</HI> to that Dignity, and ascribe divine Vertues and Powers to him, they judg'd it fit that his Succes∣sors (which were undoubtedly inspir'd with the like Graces) ought to have more Honor shew'd them than other Common-people, and therefore they visit their Tombs, and pray at them with great devotion, and make rich Offerings to them. They also give <HI>Aaly</HI> the Name of <HI>Mortoza,</HI> which is a name of Holiness, or at least hath some such signification.</P>
<P>Moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Offspring</NOTE> the <HI>Persians</HI> say that <HI>Aaly</HI> had the mark of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Seal-Ring on his back.

<P>They may not marry out of their Families, nor drink Wine, yet are free to go to Feasts where in stead of Wine they drink Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seyds</HI> which dwell in the Cities are gene∣rally rich People, for they possess whole Villages, and are free from all manner of Taxes, which makes them not a little proud. There are another Sort that pretend themselves <HI>Seyds,</HI> that go from Town to Town shewing their Marks, and living on the Alms of People, but these are commonly Deceivers and are call'd <HI>Cherseyds,</HI> that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cherseyds</HI> what they are.</NOTE> Holy Asses; some carry Hair in a round silver Box, al∣ledging that it was cut from <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Head, which through a little hole they shew to the Peo∣ple: This Hair is sold at a great Rate, and laid on their Books when they read or pray.</P>
<P>At <HI>Kisma</HI> in <HI>Kilan,</HI> was one of these Deceivers, who with a piece of Crystal held in the Sun, would fire Cotton or Paper, and perswaded the People that he was of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Race, and had made a Contract with the Heavens.</P>
<P>There are also a Sort of these who boast their original from <HI>Aaly,</HI> and are here as the <HI>Dervises</HI> among the <HI>Turks,</HI> which are such as live retir'd lives like Recluses.</P>

<HEAD>Their Festivals.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Festi∣vals.</NOTE>THe <HI>Persians</HI> keep several Festivals, and amongst others, one in commemoration of <HI>Aaly,</HI> celebrated every year with great Ceremony, especially at <HI>Ispahan,</HI> on the twenty fourth of the Moneth <HI>Ramadan;</HI> on which day they make two Processions, whereat are present, not onely many Persons of Quality, but also the King himself.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proces∣sion therein.</NOTE> In the Head of this Procession are lead two Horses richly caparison'd after the man∣ner of the Countrey; on the Saddles lie Bowes, Arrows, Shields, and Swords, and on the Pum∣mels thereof hand two <HI>Turbants,</HI> and which things represent the Arms of the Deceased <HI>Aaly;</HI> then come several Men carrying huge Pennons or Flags; next follows the Bier, cover'd with black Velvet, under which lie all manner of offensive and defensive Armor, as also Plumes and other such like Ornaments; about this go divers sorts of Musical Instruments and Singers; Persons of Quality follow on Horseback, but the vulgar sort on foot: Those that accompany this Procession take a turn about the <HI>Maidan,</HI> stopping a while before the Gate of King's Palace, and also before that of the great <HI>Mosque,</HI> where, after ha∣ving pour'd forth their Prayers, every one re∣turns to his own Habitation. The Visier of <HI>Ispa∣han</HI> and the King's Treasurer also appear on the <HI>Maidan,</HI> one on one side, and the other on the other, accompany'd by many Horsemen, which keep off the throng of People, and likewise pre∣vent Quarrels.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Festival of Roses.</NOTE>The Festival of Roses is kept when Roses blossom, and continues as long as that Season lasts. At this Feast they have peculiar Dances after their barbarous Musick, not onely in the Evening, but at Midinight and Noon-day, in publick pla∣ces and Coffee-houses; the Servants whereof be∣ing all expert in their manner, Dance from Street to Street with great delight, and use several po∣stures like our Morris-Dancers, follow'd with great Acclamations of the People, with lighted Torches, Lanterns, and Basons full of Lamps, which they carry on their Heads, and strewing Roses in all places as they pass, for which every one that meets them, gives them a small piece of Money. In other places, especially out of the City, the Men and Women flock together, Fro∣licking and making Garlands of Roses; so that this Feast seems to have some resemblance with that of the Goddess <HI>Flora.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> according to an ancient Custom, make many Offerings on the tenth of the
<PB N="73" REF="64"/>twelfth or last Moneth <HI>Difilhatze,</HI> killing two or three Lambs in each of their Houses, where they eat one part thereof, and give the other part to the Poor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Customs in <HI>Persia</HI> differ∣ing from the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE>But they have another Custom in <HI>Persia</HI> much differing from that us'd among <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians:</HI> for in all eminent Towns and Places where the King resides, whether in a City or in the Camp, they Offer a Camel with great Ceremony, be∣cause (they say) <HI>Abraham</HI> in stead of his Son (who they believe was <HI>Ismael</HI> and not <HI>Isaac</HI>) Offer'd a Camel and not a Ram, as the Scripture makes mention; but the <HI>Turks</HI> affirm that it was a Ram and not a Camel, and therefore mock at the <HI>Per∣sians</HI> Offering of Camels, though perhaps they agree in that of <HI>Ismael.</HI> They Offer their Camels after the following manner: Three days before the <HI>Biram</HI> they lead the Camel prepar'd for Offer∣ing about and through all places of the City;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of their Ca∣mel-Offer∣ings.</NOTE> and being hung full of Garlands, and cover'd with Flowers and Herbs, is attended by several Men playing on Pipes and beating on Drums, which are follow'd by a <HI>Molla</HI> or Preacher, who Sings their Creed and several Hymns, whil'st the Spe∣ctators endeavor as the Camel passes by to pluck off some of the Hair, which if they obtain, they judge themselves born in a happy hour, and pre∣serve the same as a holy Rellick; wherefore if those who are appointed to clear the Way did not prevent them, the poor Beast would undoubtedly be torn in pieces, before it could possibly be brought to the place of Offering, or at least come thither with a naked Skin: After having thus led the Camel about three days, all the Nobility, together with King, go on the fourth or <HI>Biram</HI> day, richly Habited to the <HI>Muffale,</HI> that is, <HI>The House of Prayer,</HI> which every City hath a little distance from it, set a part on purpose for this Offering: whither the Camel being brought, one of the chiefest amongst the Company, being Porter to the Kings <HI>Haram,</HI> or some other noted Person, takes a Spear and runs it into the Camels right side, be∣ing laid bound on the Ground; whereupon seve∣ral fall on promiscuously with Battel-Axes, Clubs Knives and Swords, cutting the Beast into a thou∣sand pieces. What remains of this Camels Flesh is boyl'd some part of it fresh, and the rest salted and kept, which they looking upon as Consecra∣ted, preserve with great care, as being an infalli∣ble Cure against all Distempers, and therefore ne∣ver eat thereof but when sick, onely the Head is, according to the Custom of the Countrey, sent to the King's Court.</P>
<P>This <HI>Biram</HI> Day is proclaim'd at the rising of the Sun with Trumpets, Drums, and other Instru∣ments, as also by the discharging of great Guns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Feast <HI>Asciur.</HI></NOTE>On the first day of the new Moon, which hap∣pens in the latter end of <HI>December</HI> or in the begin∣ning of <HI>January,</HI> or if the Moon appears first in the night, on the succeeding day they begin to keep the high Feast <HI>Asciur,</HI> in commemoration of <HI>Hos∣sein,</HI> which lasts ten days, during which the <HI>Persi∣ans</HI> manifest, their sorrow for his unhappy Death the manner whereof hath been already related: They Habit themselves like People overwhelm'd with Grief and Despair, neither shaving the Hair nor bathing themselves, not onely abstain∣ing from what their Law forbids, but also from all kind of Pleasures. Many poor People digging a deep Hole in the most populous Street, go into it, where standing up to the Chin, they cover their Heads with an Earthen Vessel full of Holes; in which manner they stand a whole day, whil'st an∣other poor Man sitting near, begs Alms of those that pass by. Others, as an extraordinary sign of sorrow, anoint their Bodies with a black shining Colour, which makes their Skin like Jet; some paint their Bodies red, thereby to represent the innocent Blood and cruel Derth of <HI>Hossein,</HI> and Sing several Elegies in a doleful Tone, in which they relate the Circumstances of his Death. One of the <HI>Molla's</HI> or Priests, especially of those that boast their Extract from <HI>Mahomet,</HI> stands every day at Noon in the <HI>Maidan</HI> or other open place, upon a high Stool, with a green <HI>Turbant,</HI> where he makes a Sermon, declaring the noble Acts and Holiness of <HI>Hossein,</HI> and the Circumstances of his Death. The like Sermons are Preach'd in their <HI>Metzids</HI> or Temples.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Feast and Proces∣sion.</NOTE>On the tenth of the Moneth <HI>Muharrem,</HI> which they call <HI>The Murthering Day,</HI> and is our eighth of <HI>January,</HI> they go in Procession through all the Streets in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> as on the day of <HI>Aasly's</HI> Death: for they wear the same Clothes, and have the other things belonging to that Ceremony, as Pennons, Ensigns, and Horses richly caparison'd and loaden with Armor and <HI>Turbants:</HI> Moreover, they have a Camel which tarries a Basket, wherein are two or three Children, which represent the Children of <HI>Hossein</HI> that were carry'd to Prison: These are follow'd by Biers cover'd with Velvet, on the top whereof stands a <HI>Persian Tag</HI> or <HI>Turbant.</HI></P>
<P>In these Processions the Men for the most part go Arm'd, and oftentimes Fight one with another, thereby to represent the Confusion and Hurry in which <HI>Hossein</HI> was Martyr'd, certainly believing, that whosoe're is kill'd in this Bussle, goes di∣rectly to Paradice; nay, they affirm, that during these Days of <HI>Asciur</HI> the Gates of Paradice stand always wide open, and the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> which die in that time, go directly thither without stop or stay. Lastly, all the Ceremonies for <HI>Hossein</HI>'s Mar∣tyrdom, are one and the same with those of <HI>Aaly</HI>'s, though the first are kept with greater State and Magnificence. The night before the last day the Effigies of <HI>Abubeker, Osman</HI> and <HI>Omar,</HI> and some other contrary Parties, are burnt publickly in the <HI>Maidan</HI> or Market-place.</P>
<P>On the twenty fifth of <HI>November</HI> the <HI>Persians</HI> keep a Feast of the Brotherhood, as is already mention'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Feast <HI>Abrisan.</HI></NOTE>On the fifth of <HI>July</HI> they keep a Feast, by them call'd <HI>Ab Pascian,</HI> or rather <HI>Abrizan,</HI> that is, <HI>Sprinkling of Water,</HI> for <HI>Ab</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue signifies Water, and <HI>Risan</HI> to Sprinkle; on which day the King and all his Nobles Clothe them∣selves in short Vests after the <HI>Mazanderan</HI> manner, and wear little Caps in stead of <HI>Turbants;</HI> in which Dress they repair to a Brook or some other plea∣sant watry place, where taking up the Water in little Cups, they poure the same over one anothers Bodies; but at last they grow so zealous, that throwing away the Cups, they endeavor to force each other into the Water with such eagerness, that this Day never passes without the loss of ma∣ny Persons.</P>

<P>From whence this Feast hath its original, we do not certainly know, neither do the <HI>Persians</HI> themselves, as we suppose: Some ascribe the rise thereof to the <HI>Christians,</HI> in commemoration of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist;</HI> and this Opinion they strengthen with this Reason,<HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Christians,</HI> and al∣most all People of <HI>Asia,</HI> keep the same, though not upon one day; or (as others say) in memory of the three Kings, and because our Saviour was Baptiz'd at the River <HI>Jordan</HI> by <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist.</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> call this Day <HI>Cackciuciran,</HI> that is, <HI>Cross-water-day,</HI> for they place a Cross in the Water on that Day, from whence this Festival Day hath receiv'd its Denomination.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses, Japanners,</HI> and many other of the neighboring People, keep such a kind of Feast as this, which they call <HI>Tuonu.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Their Policy in Government, Oeconomy, and Splendor of the Court.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Govern∣ment abso∣lutely Mo∣narchical.</NOTE>THe Government of this Countrey is by absolute Monarchy, for the King being the Chief, hath all things in his own power, to do whatsoe're he pleases, being able to make or break Laws without any contradiction, nay, to take away any ones Estate or Life, though he be the greatest Lord in the Countrey; in short, his Will is a Law in all things to his Peo∣ple.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Ti∣tle.</NOTE>The general Title of the King is <HI>Sophy,</HI> deriv'd from the <HI>Arabick</HI> word <HI>Suff,</HI> which signifies <HI>Woolly,</HI> because the last Kings have instituted an Order to wear Woollen, and not Cotton or Linnen <HI>Tur∣bants,</HI> as the <HI>Turks</HI> do; or else because <HI>Sophy</HI> signi∣fies <HI>Wise,</HI> or <HI>Experienc'd,</HI> according to the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Olearius</HI> tells us, that Writers call the last <HI>Per∣sian</HI> Kings <HI>Sophy,</HI> because the Promoter of their Sect was call'd <HI>Schach Sefi,</HI> from whom it is become a Title of Honor, as <HI>Defender of the Faith</HI> to his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain, Most Christian</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Catholick</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Ismael</HI> also caus'd himself to be nam'd <HI>Schach Sade,</HI> that is, <HI>The Son of Schach,</HI> as a token of his Extract from <HI>Schach Sefi,</HI> who was so highly esteem'd amongst them.</P>
<P>Some say that this Name <HI>Sophy</HI> signifies a Man, which renouncing the World, endeavors onely to serve God; so that <HI>Xeque Ismael</HI> bore the Title of <HI>Sophy,</HI> because he appear'd to be the greatest Pro∣moter of his Sect. And sometime before him, <HI>Halilah</HI> being advanc'd to great Dignity, was for the same reason call'd <HI>Sophy.</HI> But since <HI>Schach Is∣mael</HI> none of his Successors have us'd that Title; and though there are a great number of <HI>Sophies</HI> through all <HI>Persia,</HI> yet we must know they are all Ecclesiasticks.</P>
<P>The right Name which the <HI>Persians</HI> give to their King, is <HI>Schach</HI> or <HI>Sa,</HI> after the <HI>Italian</HI> pronuncia∣tion, which signifies <HI>King;</HI> or <HI>Patxa,</HI> which others write <HI>Padischa,</HI> that is, <HI>The supream Schach,</HI> or <HI>King of Kings:</HI> They also call him <HI>Sahib,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>Governor.</HI> Some also affirm, that the Kings are likewise nam'd <HI>Choda</HI> or <HI>Chodohon,</HI> which in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue signifies <HI>God;</HI> but that is onely a mistake, for <HI>Choda</HI> or <HI>Chodabende</HI> as the Sir-name of <HI>Schach-Abbas</HI>'s Father; the natural signification of the word is one that is oblig'd to God.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Persian</HI> Court are many which bear the Title of <HI>King,</HI> as <HI>Chan</HI> and <HI>Sultan</HI> have the signifi∣cations of <HI>King,</HI> the one in the <HI>Turkish,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue, which proceeds from hence, because the chief Princes of <HI>Persia,</HI> to make themselves the more eminent, will have Subjects that are styl'd Kings, though in truth they are but Vice-Roys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mirza,</HI> its signification.</NOTE><HI>Mizza</HI> or <HI>Mirza,</HI> is in the <HI>Arabick</HI> properly a Title of Honor, and signifies <HI>Prince,</HI> or more pecu∣liarly, <HI>A Prince of the Blood,</HI> according to which signification the eldest Son, who is Heir apparent to the Crown, bears no other Name, being gene∣rally call'd <HI>Sultan Mirza,</HI> i.e. <HI>Prince of the Realm.</HI></P>
<P>Persons of Quality generally bear two Names, besides a third, which is a Title of Honor, which last is commonly put behind, as <HI>Assa Chan Beid,</HI> that is, <HI>Isa,</HI> or <HI>Jesus Chan Lord,</HI> which is quite con∣trary to the <HI>Christians,</HI> who always place their Title before their Name.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Turks</HI> style the <HI>Persian</HI> Kings.</NOTE>The <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor in his Letters to the King of <HI>Persia</HI> doth not style him <HI>Schach,</HI> but <HI>Schach Ogli,</HI> that is, <HI>A holy Mans,</HI> or <HI>Prophets Son.</HI></P>
<P>The King to be distinguish'd from other Per∣sons wears a red <HI>Turbant,</HI> differing in fashion from others, with twelve Ribbons, instituted by <HI>Schach Ismael,</HI> in commemoration of the twelve Sons of <HI>Aaly,</HI> from whom he boasted his Extract. This <HI>Turbant,</HI> which some call <HI>Tage</HI> or <HI>Tache,</HI> is as much with them as a Crown with us. <HI>Minadoi</HI> tells us, that the first <HI>Calif</HI> or <HI>Mustaed Dini,</HI> puts the said <HI>Turbant</HI> on the King's Head at his Coronation, or taking upon him the Government. The King also wears his <HI>Turbant</HI> after another manner than other People, for that which they wear before, he wears behind, which none in all <HI>Persia</HI> dares do but him∣self, upon pain of Death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kingdom descends by Inheritance.</NOTE>This Kingdom is Hereditary, and the King's eldest Son always succeeds him in the Throne. So long as there be any Heirs of the lawful Wife, they Inherit, but for want of such, those that are begotten on the <HI>Chassees</HI> or Concubines, and for defect of such, it devolves upon the deceased King's nearest Relations. These, as also those that boast themselves to be deriv'd from the old <HI>Sefi,</HI> are call'd <HI>Schach Elwend,</HI> or <HI>Schachavends,</HI> that is, <HI>Successor</HI> of <HI>Schach,</HI> and have great Priviledges in the Coun∣trey, yet for the most part live very sparingly.</P>
<P>The Houses in which the King's Children are
<PB N="75" REF="65"/>born, they make priviledg'd places, and if it be from the Court, and in any remote place, the House is immediately inclos'd with a Wall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Arms.</NOTE>In ancient times the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> bore a Cre∣scent proper for their Coat of Arms, as the <HI>Greeks</HI> the Sun; but now it is quite contrary, for the <HI>Per∣sians</HI> bear a Sun, and the <HI>Turks</HI> which possess <HI>Greece,</HI> a Half-Moon. But <HI>Schach Sefi</HI> bore in his Great Seal, which was about the bigness of a Half-Crown, nothing but this Inscription, <HI>I Schach Sefi am a zealous Servant of the onely God,</HI> and about the edges was Engraven, <HI>Aaly, they may say of you what they please, I am always your Friend; who before this Seal doth not account himself Dust and Earth, though he be an Angel, may he be turn'd to Dust and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Corona∣tion.</NOTE>The Coronation is celebrated in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> though formerly at <HI>Cafa</HI> or <HI>Cufa,</HI> near <HI>Bagdad,</HI> but remov'd from thence by reason of the too near neighbor∣hood of the <HI>Turks;</HI> the manner of it is as follow∣eth: On a Table an Ell high they lay as many rich Carpets as there have been Kings of that Dignity since the beginning of <HI>Schach Ismael Sefi;</HI> upon these they set their new King, to whom the chief <HI>Chans</HI> carry the Crown, which he kisses three times in the Name of <HI>GOD, Mahomet,</HI> and <HI>Aaly,</HI> and then rubbing his Forehead with the same, his Chamberlain, whom they call <HI>Lele,</HI> sets it upon his Head, at which they all cry, <HI>God save the King, God grant him to Reign from one to a thousand years;</HI> then kissing his Feet they bring him great Presents, and spend the day in Mirth and Jollity. <HI>Minadoy</HI> tells us, that the chief <HI>Calif</HI> sets the <HI>Tur∣bant</HI> or <HI>Tage</HI> on the King's Head at his entring into the Throne; but they take no Oaths, nor have any Restrictions laid upon them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Bury∣ing-place.</NOTE>The Kings, and those of the Royal Family are generally bury'd at <HI>Ardebil,</HI> and lie interr'd round about <HI>Schach Sefi</HI>'s Tomb.</P>
<P>When the King appears at any publick Meet∣ing, he is generally accompany'd, besides twelve Courtiers, with the <HI>Seder, Minatzim,</HI> and <HI>Hakim.</HI> The <HI>Hakim</HI> is his Physician, and tells him what Meat is wholsom, and what unwholsom. The <HI>Mi∣natzim</HI> is his Astrologer, who acquaints him with all the good and bad Hours wherein he is to un∣dertake any great Design, and is herein credited like an Oracle, the King undertaking nothing without his Advice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seder</HI> is the chief of the Clergy, and is as the <HI>Muffi</HI> amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> elected by the King and <HI>Casi,</HI> being generally a Learned Man, well skill'd in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and must be ready to give his Opinion on all such things as are demanded of him, because according to his Judgment they pass Sentence. Some Decrees are also Pass'd by the <HI>Seder</HI> himself, who Sealing them with his own Signet, sends the same to die King, who writes un∣der him, <HI>This is the Opinion of the Seder, which We confirm;</HI> under which he puts his Great Seal.</P>
<P>The Causes of Citizens are Judg'd by other Lawyers, who are call'd <HI>Orf,</HI> and are under the chief Judge <HI>Diwanbeki,</HI> who is no less experienc'd in the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Tenents than the <HI>Seder.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Juridi∣cal Courts.</NOTE>The Days on which they keep their Courts of Judicature are <HI>Mondays</HI> and <HI>Thursdays,</HI> on which they meet at <HI>Ispahan</HI> near the King's Palace, in a publick arch'd place, where they hear and deter∣mine Causes, and if any thing chance to come be∣fore them, which they judge to be of too great consequence for them to decide, then they order it to be heard before the King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Punish∣ments of Of∣fenders.</NOTE>All Offenders or Criminals are punish'd with extream severity, the manner whereof is several, and many times invented by the Judges, accord∣ing to the nature of the Crimes; but the most asual are to cut off their Noses, Hands, and Feet, ripping up of the Belly, flaying alive, and hang∣ing up by the Heels; which last is perform'd after this manner: They make two Holes in the Ma∣lefactors Legs behind the Ancle, between the Bone and the great Tendon, through which they put a Rope, whereby they hang them on a Tree so high, that their Heads do just touch the Ground; in which manner, if the Malefactor be condemn'd to die, they let him hang two or three days, till after an intolerable number of Pains he gives up the Ghost; or if he die not in that man∣ner, then they shorten his time by ripping open his Belly. Others for smaller Offences are hang'd up an hour or two with their Head downwards. He that Ravisheth a Woman, and is convicted by her Swearing three times, or commits Sodomy, hath his Genitals cut off.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Usury for∣bidden.</NOTE>Their Laws forbid the putting of Money out to Use, which nevertheless they do privately; but if any one be accus'd and found guilty thereof, he is accounted worse than a <HI>Jew,</HI> and not permitted to come in company with any Persons of note. In <HI>Ardebil</HI> dwelt one, who lending Money by the Moneth at a Dollar and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> had his Teeth knock'd out with a Hammer. Such Per∣sons as practise this, are call'd <HI>Suchur,</HI> which sig∣nifies <HI>Usurer.</HI> But at they permit the Mortgaging of Lands for a Sum of Money, which the Lender re∣pays himself by the Rent, without receiving any other Interest.</P>
<P><HI>Schach Abbas</HI> and <HI>Schach Sefi</HI> us'd strange and horrid ways to punish Criminals; some they caus'd to be made fast betwixt two Boards, and then Saw'd in two in the middle.</P>
<P>A <HI>Persian</HI> Ambassador being on a time sent to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and treating his Servants ill in his Journey thither, and they complaining of it, the King, at his Return into <HI>Persia,</HI> with his own Hands cut off his Nose and Ears, and a piece of Flesh out of his Arms, which he forc'd him in his Presence to eat.</P>
<P>It is also a very common Punishment at <HI>Ispahan,</HI> to throw down Malefactors from the Steeple built on the Mosque <HI>Haron Viliaier,</HI> and afterwards to burn them. To this Death Women which have committed any hainous Crimes are condemn'd.</P>
<P>When any Person of Quality that is in the King's Service hath committed a Crime which he supposes may hazard the loss of his Life, he goes with a naked Sword hung about his Neck before his Majesty's Privy-Chamber, to beg pardon for his Offence.</P>
<P>Robbers and Highway-men are set in the Ground up to the Middle, and the upper part of their Bodies inclos'd with great Posts six Foot high, and so starv'd to death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Good travel∣ling in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE>But because <HI>Persia</HI> is inhabited in most places, it is very secure travelling, insomuch that the whole Countrey is free from Thieves. If any be robb'd in his Journey, though it be by his own Servants, the Villages near which the Fact is committed, or the Magistrates thereof, upon the Complaint of the Person robb'd, either pay the value, or restore to him the like Goods taken from him. There is also Guards for the security of the Roads, which are call'd <HI>Rabdari,</HI> to whom Tra∣vellers give small Sums of Money.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The several Officers of the Court.</NOTE>At the Court are divers Officers which have each a Title according to their employments, and follow one another in their several Degrees.</P>
<P><HI>Eahtemad-Dowlet</HI> is the Chancellor, whose bu∣siness it is to look after the Revenue of the Realm, and to increase the same; from whence he bears his Title, and is like a Vice-Roy, and not onely publick, but also all manner of private Business doth pass through his Hands.</P>
<P>A <HI>Curtzibaschi</HI> is a Commander over ten or twelve thousand Bowe-men, which being first rais'd by <HI>Schach Ismael,</HI> dwell in several Parts of the Countrey as a Free-people, and upon any occasion march to a known Rendezvouz, where the said General meets and commands them.</P>
<P><HI>Meheter</HI> is a Gentleman-usher, who is constant∣ly with the King in his Chamber or at any publick Meeting, and in the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and therefore is often permitted to speak with more freedom than the Chancellor.</P>
<P><HI>Wakeunis,</HI> is a Privy Councellor and Secretary, who writes the King's Letters and Edicts, and also keeps an Account of the Revenues of the Crown; to which purpose he hath eleven Clarks or Under-Secretaries allow'd him.</P>
<P>Every Precinct or Ward of a City hath a pe∣culiar Governor or Magistrate, whom they call <HI>Aksacal,</HI> that is, Grey-beard, though never so young, which amongst other Affairs take care of the King's Guests that are lodg'd in any <HI>Caravan∣sera</HI> standing within their Liberty, that they want nothing they are desirous to have.</P>
<P><HI>Assas</HI> is a Constable of the Watch, but hath greater Power, for he is not onely authoriz'd to take or apprehend any suspitious Persons, but al∣so to punish them; nay, take away their Lives according to Martial Law; provided, the Offen∣der be taken in the Fact.</P>
<P>The <HI>Diwanbeki</HI> though a Supream Judge, and often sitting on the Bench with the <HI>Seder</HI> and <HI>Casi,</HI> is forc'd, when the King punishes any person of Quality with Death, to perform the Office of Executioner himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Culargasi</HI> bears Command over the <HI>Culams,</HI> that is, Slaves or Servants who have sold them∣selves to be the King's Servants, who performing the Office of Soldiers, are eight thousand in Num∣ber, and like the <HI>Curtzi</HI> are Quarter'd in the Countrey at the King's charge.</P>
<P><HI>Eischicagasi-Baschi</HI> is the chief Marshal or Com∣mander of forty <HI>Eischicagasi,</HI> who though they dwell in several Parts of the Countrey, wait by turns, five at a time, and generally stand at those Doors through which you must go into the pre∣sence of the King, from whence they are call'd Door-keepers. When any strange Ambassadors have Audience before the King, then the <HI>Eischi∣caga-Baschi</HI> having a <HI>Dekemek</HI> or Staff, leads them up by the Arm.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jesaul Sohebet</HI> or Master of the Ceremo∣nies, places all Strangers that are invited to eat at the King's Table, in their proper Places, where∣fore he always attends with a Staff in his Hand be∣fore the Pallace Gate to receive and comple∣ment such strange Guests.</P>

<P>The <HI>Dawattar</HI> is the Secretary, who always carries a little Ball like our Printing Balls, with which, when occasion requires he wets the Seal with Ink, which the King constantly wears about his Neck to make an Impression with, from whence he also receives his Denomination <HI>Dawat</HI> or Ink-carrier, for the <HI>Persians</HI> Print all their seals wetted with Ink on Paper, in stead of making Im∣pressions in Wax.</P>
<P><HI>Mohur</HI> signifies a Signet or Seal-Ring, and the word <HI>Dar,</HI> which hath a general signification of Officer, is us'd in a commanding sense, in stead of having; as if you would say, Haver or Keeper of the Seal. Besides the Great Seal, the King hath a less Signet to seal his Letters withal, which he sends to his Vice-Roys and Governors, and o∣ther publick Writings wherewith no Person is intrusted, for the King wears the same in his Ring, and makes an Impression with his own Hand therewith.</P>

<P>The King also ordains another peculiar <HI>Mehi∣mander,</HI> to take care and provide for such Ambas∣sadors as he esteems more than ordinary; the other Officers are of meaner degree, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Isauly,</HI> are a People who as Messengers, wait at Court, and are sent abroad on all occasions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kischiktzibaschi,</HI> is Captain of the Guard, as the <HI>Tzabedar</HI> is Master of the Ordnance, and the <HI>Tzartzi</HI> chief Herald at Arms, who proclai∣meth all the King's Edicts.</P>

<P>All Officers or Servants belonging to the Court, have each according to their Qualities, great Pension or Salary, which is not paid them out of the King's Revenue or Treasury, but from several Villages which are allotted for that purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Allow∣ance of the <HI>Chans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Chans</HI> have certain Lands and Villages thereto belonging allowed them, yet they receive the Revenue and are as Magistrates, judging and determining all things but Matters of Life and Death; some have certain Customs given them, others receive for their Salary, the Taxes laid on Houses of Entertainment.</P>

<P>On their <HI>Neuruz</HI> or New-years Day, the King according to an antient Custom receives Presents from all his chief Officers, unless the day be sus∣pected ominous, for then the King never comes out of his <HI>Haram</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the King gives Audi∣ence to Am∣bassadors.</NOTE> as we have before mention'd.</P>
<P>The King seldom grants Audience to any Am∣bassadors in private, but always at a publick Din∣ner, and in presence of all the Guests, notwith∣standing their business be never so secret. No <HI>Persian</HI> whatsoever, whether Subject or Stranger, may appear before the King without great Pre∣sents; nay, not the Ambassadors from strange Princes, which is a very antient Custom, and was (as <HI>Philostratus</HI> tell us) us'd in the time of the Kings of <HI>Media.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ex∣pects Presents</NOTE>The Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> demand Presents from those that are their Homagers, who pay no Tri∣bute, and this Custom is kept amongst all Eastern Princes to this very day; they pub∣lickly provide that if any Foreigners bring Presents that are not thought fit for the Emperors Greatness, they make him remain still there, with more of the like Petitioners, so by that means their Presents make the greater shew and appear the more glorious to the Spectators; they report further, that if the Present seems not equi∣valent to the King's Greatness, there is an additi∣on out of the Wardrobe, silently hinting that they or whoever else, cannot come too well provided or their next Addresses. But the reciprocal presenting of these Princes one to another, they look upon as such a Due, that they expect it as a Debt, and the neglect thereof hath bred so much animosity as hath caus'd a War, and par∣ticularly between the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Persians, Anno</HI> 1618. because King <HI>Abbas</HI> had many years neg∣lected his Presents, which amounted to a very considerable value to the Grand Seignior. Those that bring the Ambassador's Presents to the King, are a poor sort of people kept by the King for that purpose: To every Present are order'd as many people to carry it as there are pieces and several sorts of things, for every man is to carry but one piece though never so small.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Order how the <HI>Ha∣ram</HI> travels.</NOTE>If the King's Wives travel in Company with him, they always ride on Horse-back unveyl'd but strongly guarded: Moreover, the King on all such occasions always rides in the Middle of his <HI>Haram,</HI> and spends his time in Discourse, first with one, and then with another. And when the Women of the <HI>Haram</HI> travel alone, or in company with the King, they always go in the following order:</P>
<P>A League before march a certain number of Eunuchs, who drive all those that they meet with both by Night and Day out of the Way, that they may not meet the <HI>Haram;</HI> nay, they have Power to clear whole Towns and Villages; and wound and kill all such as contest and will not retire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women never seen un∣veyl'd.</NOTE>The Eastern Princes account it a great Abo∣mination for any of their Women to be seen by their Subjects; for not onely Ladies of Quality, but also the meanest Slaves that belong to the Court, are never seen by any strange men, but onely the King himself and his Eunuchs: After them follows a Company of Soldiers call'd <HI>Jasacksi,</HI> which are like the King's Life-guard, who prevent all Persons of what Quality soever, from passing to the <HI>Haram.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Haram</HI> what it means.</NOTE>Because the Word <HI>Haram</HI> is often mention'd, we will explain what it means: <HI>Haram</HI> is an <HI>Ara∣bick</HI> Word, and signifies properly amongst the <HI>Arabians,</HI> that which is forbidden and disallow'd by the Law.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persian-Mahumetans</HI> and those that inhabit the Eastern Countreys of <HI>Asia,</HI> understand by the <HI>Haram,</HI> the <HI>Seraglio</HI> of Concubines, and accord∣ingly, when they intend to say that the King or Prince is in the Womens Lodgings, they say, The King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is in the <HI>Haram;</HI> the Servants of the <HI>Haram,</HI> and so with all other things.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Recrea∣tion of the King's Wives</NOTE>The King never travels abroad, nay, not to the Wars without his <HI>Haram.</HI> The King's Wives recreate themselves every <HI>Wednesday</HI> in <HI>Ispahan</HI> with great freedom, in the Street <HI>Tziaharbag,</HI> and in the Gardens thereabouts, where they are at∣tended by many Ladies of Honor but during their stay, all the <HI>Avenues</HI> and Ways are guard∣ed to keep out the men, whil'st the Women some∣times spend whole Nights in several Pastimes by Torch and Candle-light.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">All places fit∣ted for the King's Recep∣tion, and the Reason why.</NOTE>The King's Gardens in all his Royal Cities, as in <HI>Ispahan, Casbin, &amp;c.</HI> are provided with Con∣cubines, Slaves, and all manner of Necessaries, because the King stays not long in one place, nei∣ther goes with much Company, for he often tra∣vels with onely two or three Horse-men, which many times ride so hard, that they finish a Jour∣ney of thirty days in five or six; to which pur∣pose he keeps exceeding swift Horses at appoint∣ed Stages, where they always stand ready saddl'd and bridl'd, because they are uncertain of his coming; and because his Train cannot follow him with that speed, therefore he hath a House in most of the wall'd Cities of his Realm, furnish∣ed with all manner of Necessaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Pa∣lace a privi∣ledg'd place.</NOTE>The King's <HI>Douletchane</HI> or Pallace in <HI>Ispahan,</HI> is a priviledg'd Place or Sanctuary for all Male∣factors that fly thither and touch the Ring, Ham∣mer or Knocker of the Gate, which is in such e∣steem or Veneration, that the whole Court re∣ceive it's Name <HI>Astane</HI> from it, and as a Token thereof, when they name this Royal <HI>Knocker,</HI> they add the Word <HI>Doulet</HI> thereto, that is, good Luck, and say <HI>Astane Doulet,</HI> that is the Knocker of good Luck, and understand the King's Court by the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another pri∣viledg'd place</NOTE>The <HI>Alcapy</HI> is also a priviledg'd Place, where no Person, nay, not the King himself hath power to touch any Malefactor or Debtor; wherefore many flying thither stay there till they have compounded with their Creditors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Familia∣rity of the King.</NOTE>The King, as also most of the Nobility in <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> cause most of their Meat to be drest in their Presence; nay prepare the same with their own Hands; nay, more than this, he for all his great∣ness, sometimes makes himself very familiar a∣mongst his Subjects, eats as he passes along the Streets, and in the midst of the <HI>Bazars</HI> or Exchan∣ges; often standing still before a Cooks Shop, and sees what Meat they dress, and sometimes goes unexpectedly into a Tradesman's House, where sitting down, he eats with great and un∣imaginable freedom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Lodgings</NOTE>In the Chambers or Tents in which the King sleeps, are always eight or ten Beds made ready, so that no person knows which he intends to lie on, nay, sometimes when he wakes in the night,
<PB N="79" REF="67"/>he goes from one Bed to another, and so lies on three or four in one Night, which he doth to no other end but to prevent sudden Assassination, and that by that Means he might have time to Arm himself for his Defence.</P>
<P>In many of the High-ways the King hath di∣vers Houses and Gardens; the Houses for the most part are built and furnish'd after one fashion, <HI>viz.</HI> small, with many little Chambers, which have divers Doors: The Walls and Cielings be∣ing very smooth, are Painted and richly Gilded, yet without Order or Art.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Houses.</NOTE>The King hath many handsom Houses, but his chiefest Court is kept at <HI>Ispahan</HI> in the Summer, and in the Winter in <HI>Ferhabad.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of the Moneth <HI>Ramadhan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Hunting.</NOTE> which is our <HI>Lent,</HI> the King goes to <HI>Abicurrong</HI> in the Mountains to take the fresh Air, and to Hunt, in which Sport he spends several days, attended by some thousands of People. At the Ears of those Beasts which the King takes alive he hangs golden Plates, on which are Engraven certain Marks, and then setting them at Liberty again, often re-takes them; nay some have been taken who have had the Marks of King <HI>Thamas, Ismael Sefi,</HI> and other ancient Princes.</P>
<P>In all the Provinces of <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bull-baiting.</NOTE> Bull-baiting is very common, but especially about <HI>Caxem,</HI> the Inhabitants whereof travel up and down into seve∣ral Countreys to find out the strongest and fairest Bulls, which they bring to <HI>Ispahan,</HI> where upon the <HI>Maidan</HI> or Market-place, naked Men En∣counter with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Musical In∣struments among the <HI>Persians.</HI></NOTE>In the Kings Palace at any Entertainment, as also at Entertainments in Noblemens Houses, are commonly young Women, who Dance to the sound of a <HI>Diara</HI> or little Drum; but their com∣mon Instruments are Cymbals and Citterns; yet besides these they have another call'd <HI>Scig,</HI> made of Copper, round, and hollow within, which holding in one Hand, they strike upon it with the other; but the chiefest Instrument is a Tabor, hung round about with Bells. This Instrument is very common in all the Eastern Countreys, but especially in <HI>Persia,</HI> the Inhabitants whereof take such delight in them, that the King never makes any great Entertainment, but he always hath se∣veral who Dance to the sound of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Dan∣cing.</NOTE>The manner of Dancing us'd by the <HI>Persians</HI> is not unpleasing, for they Sing and Dance together in a King; he that leads the Dance Sings a Verse or two of some merry Song, the rest bearing the <HI>Chorus</HI> or Burden.</P>
<P>The Nobles also at the Kings Court every Evening, at the sound of several Instruments, play at a certain Game with a Hammer and Ball, not unlike our Palmall, which every one that pleases may come and see.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Recrea∣tion of the Nobles.</NOTE>The King often invites mean Persons that are well experienc'd in this Game, to play at it, which is perform'd after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> The Gamesters divide themselves into two Parties on Horseback, one at each end of the place where the Game is to be play'd, and with a woodden Hammer, which they hold in the right Hand, they strike a light woodden Ball (not with the flat Head of the Hammer, but with the side, which is somewhat hollow'd out) at the set Mark, in which the winning of the Game consists; without any wrangling or dispute; but the chiefest part of the Game is to follow the Ball, and strike it beyond the Mark, before those at the other end can pre∣vent them. Great dexterity is requir'd in this Game, and also exceeding swiftness, as well of he Horse as the Rider; and this is the onely way whereby the <HI>Persians</HI> learn to Ride so well. Those that play are also dress'd after a peculiar manner in Clothes of several colours, with rich <HI>Turbants</HI> a∣dorn'd with Plumes of Feathers and other Orna∣nents.</P>
<P>They have another Exercise call'd <HI>The Baiting of the Wolf,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wolf-baiting</NOTE> but it is us'd by none but the inferior sort of People, <HI>viz.</HI> A Wolf being let loose, the People, having each Man a Cloak on, encompass the Beast in great numbers, shouting and hollow∣ing; and if at any time the enraged Wolf falls in amongst them, and seizes any one, the whole Croud rescue the Person in danger, and assail the Beast. And these two are the chiefest, and most esteemed Exercises amongst the <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Furni∣ture of their Tables at Meals.</NOTE>All the <HI>Chans</HI> and other great Lords residing at the Kings Court, being prime Officers of State, have their Tables spread with a large eight cor∣ner'd Carpet of Cloth-of-Gold, or embroider'd Sattin, with rich Fringe: The Dishes wherein the Meat is brought to the Table are of massie Gold, as also their Drinking-Cups, which hold about a Pint and a half. But <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> had all his serv'd up in Glass for a distinction from others. They deliver with every Cup a great woodden Spoon or Ladle with a long Handle, which they use more to drink out of, than to eat withal, nei∣ther do they make use of any other Spoons but what are made after that manner, and of sweet-smelling Wood, which having been once us'd, are never brought to the Table again. They never use Forks or Knives, but the Steward (who per∣forms the Office of a Carver) cuts the Meat with a great square Golden Slice, which he always car∣ries in his Hand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How their Meat is serv'd up.</NOTE> In the setting the Meat on the Table, the Servants bring not the Dishes toge∣ther, but standing in a row from the Kitchin, they hand them from one to another to the Table. They commonly have but one Mess, for they set all their Dishes at once upon the Table. Each Person also receives Wine from a Waiter, in or∣der according to his Quality, out of a golden Tumbler. Every one is permitted to rise from Table without shewing Reverence to any, and if their Occasions chance to call them out of the Room, they go away without taking leave of any, though the King himself be present. The Wa∣ter with which they wash their Hands is brought in gold en Basons. The King and other great Persons seldom drink any Wine without Ice or Snow. The Ice which they use is made of the clearest Water after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> Not far from the City in a great Plain, a Bank is rais'd or cast up, directly from East to West, which being about a hundred and fifty Foot long, and very thick, is so high, that it shadows the Plain from the Sun-beams when the Sun is at the heighth: At the end of this Bank are two Arms, which ex∣tending from the South to the North, are full as high as the main Bank, and about twenty four Foot long, and keep off the Morning and Evening Sun; so that this Plain lies shaded all the day long: In this shady place is a Moat of about twen∣ty or thirty Foot deep, extending from the one Arm of the Bank to the other: In the midst of Winter when it Freezes hardest, they Plough this Plain, which lies open to the Northern Winds, full of small Furrows about three or four Fingers deep, and so letting in the Water, overflow it,
<PB N="80" REF="68"/>which in one Night freezing to the bottom, is the next Morning before the rising of the Sun thrown into the Moat, and Water pour'd upon it to make it condense the harder; and this Practice they continue for a whole Moneth together, or longer, till the Moat is fill'd to the top with Ice; then they cover it with Straw to prevent the melt∣ing thereof by the heat of the Sun, and to keep it from Rain, In the Summer this Ice being bro∣ken with Pick-axes, is carry'd through the City to be sold on Horses or Mules, two or three pieces being a sufficient Burthen. The Ice being broken with a Hammer into greater or lesser pieces, is ei∣ther put into the Vessel with the Wine, or into the Cups when they drink. They also lay pieces of Ice in their Dishes with Fruit and other Cates, which is very pleasing to the Eye, especially if that which lies under the Ice appears through it. The King's Dishes, Urns, and Drinking-Cups, which he uses at his Table, are all of massie Gold. The <HI>Chans</HI> and other Nobles have their <HI>Pilao</HI> or Rice, colour'd black and yellow, and made savory with Herbs, or else dulcifi'd with Sugar, brought on their Tables also in Gold and Silver Dishes.</P>

<HEAD>The Government of the peculiar Provinces.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Provinces are Govern'd.</NOTE>ALl the Provinces in <HI>Persia</HI> which are remote from the King's Court, are Govern'd by <HI>Chans, Sultans, Calenters, Darago's, Visiers,</HI> and <HI>Caucha's.</HI> The King chuses the <HI>Chans</HI> (who are as much as Princes or Vice-Roys,) and makes them Governors of what Provinces he pleases; but commonly he elects them who by their vali∣ant Exploits, Piety, or other noble Vertues, have gain'd the love of their Countrey: wherefore ma∣ny, in hopes to attain to that Honor, behave them∣selves very valiantly in any Engagement, and desperately venture their Lives for the Title of <HI>Chan.</HI> But the Children of those who are thus chosen, Inherit not amongst the <HI>Persians;</HI> for though they are held in great Respect, and enjoy their Father's Goods, yet they are not honor'd with his Title, nor succeed him in his Office, ex∣cept they are judg'd worthy thereof by their own Merits. But <HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that the King gives the Dignity of <HI>Chan</HI> to one of his Subjects, not onely for his Life, but also permits his Children to succeed him after his Death, and that there are Families found that have enjoy'd this Title above two hundred years.</P>
<P>As soon as the King hath made any one a <HI>Chan,</HI> he immediately gives him Lands and Men to sup∣port his Grandeur, which he enjoys as long as he lives; but if at any time he chance to be suspected by the King, he is immediately turn'd out of his Employment, and all his Goods seiz'd.</P>
<P>Each Province hath a <HI>Chan</HI> and a <HI>Calenter,</HI> who resides in the Metropolis thereof. The <HI>Chan</HI> be∣ing the King's Vice-Roy, Executes the Law, doth Justice to all, and passes Sentence of Death on Criminals, without any special Order from the Court.</P>
<P>The chiefest <HI>Chan</HI> is he who Governs <HI>Sciras,</HI> the Metropolis of the Province of <HI>Persia,</HI> properly so call'd, who is able to bring an Army of thirty thousand Men into the Field, the Countrey which he Commands being said to be bigger than <HI>Por∣tugal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Calenter</HI> is as a Collector or Treasurer of the Province, gathering all the Revenues, and giving an Account thereof either to the King or <HI>Chans.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Darugo</HI> or <HI>Darago,</HI> otherwise <HI>Hacom,</HI> is like a Governor or Mayor of a City, every City ha∣ving one.</P>
<P>A <HI>Caucha</HI> is as much as an under Sheriff.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Equi∣page of Am∣bassadors.</NOTE>The King usually sends the <HI>Chans</HI> and <HI>Sultans</HI> as Agents to foreign Princes, and fits them out af∣ter this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> The King orders them to give great Presents to those Princes unto whom they are sent, of which the one half is given out of the King's Treasury, and the other part, as also all other Necessaries, the Province which the <HI>Chan</HI> Governs is to provide, which often causes great disturbance and confusion.</P>
<P>In some Provinces the <HI>Chans</HI> must maintain a certain number of Soldiers for the King, which besides their own, must be ready for Service on all occasions; but then the King receivs no Tribute from them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chans</HI> make great Presents to the King.</NOTE>The <HI>Chans</HI> commonly on <HI>New-years-day</HI> make great Presents to the King.</P>
<P>Some Provinces, especially where there are no <HI>Chans,</HI> but onely <HI>Darago's,</HI> and therefore no Sol∣diers kept, as in the Towns of <HI>Caswin, Ispahan, Cashan, Theheran, Hamadan, Meschet,</HI> and <HI>Kirman,</HI> pay great Tributes to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> affirms, that in <HI>Ispahan</HI> and several other eminent Cities, there are no <HI>Chans,</HI> because they are Royal Cities, and the King many times keeps his Court there.</P>
<P>On the Feast of <HI>Neuruz</HI> all annual Officers are chosen, especially the <HI>Darago's,</HI> the chiefest where∣of enter upon their Employments in great State, with the sound of many Instruments.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they re∣verence the Kings.</NOTE>The King's Vice-Roys, whither <HI>Sultans</HI> or <HI>Chans,</HI> of what Degree soever, when coming out of any remote Province to make their appearance before the King, or when they take leave, or are to return to their own Countreys, they kneel on both Knees before the King, and kiss his Feet, and in testimony of Honor, squeeze the same against their Foreheads, which they do three several times. This Ceremony they perform divers times as they walk about the King, which they com∣monly do three times one after another, there∣by to manifest, that those who perform this Ce∣remony, make themselves Sureties against all Misfortunes whatsoever that may befall the King.</P>
<P>It is also a Custom amongst them, to make a Circle with their Hands about the Heads of those whom they would shew Honor to, and wish that all future Misfortunes, and such as have already hap∣ned unto them, may fall on themselves. This Action is accounted by them a sign of a perfect and faithful Friendship.</P>
<P>Thus much of the modern State and manner of Government in <HI>Persia,</HI> now it will be necessary to give you a short Account after what manner it was Govern'd in former times.</P>
<P>THe King of <HI>Persia</HI> anciently styl'd himself <HI>The Great King,</HI> especially at that time when they had conquer'd the <HI>Greeks.</HI> But <HI>Suidas</HI> tells us, that these Monarchs were not satisfi'd with this Title, but assum'd to themselves the Title of <HI>The King of Kings,</HI> as appears by the In∣scription on <HI>Cyrus</HI>'s Tomb.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="68"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their order of Succession.</NOTE>The Sons of these Kings succeeded them, which was also observ'd amongst the <HI>Parthians,</HI> when they had made themselves Masters of this Realm; and when the <HI>Persians</HI> were afterwards restor'd, they still maintain'd the same Custom. The el∣dest Son, according to the Laws of Nature, Inhe∣rited before the younger, but if he was born be∣fore his Father came to the Crown, then he that was first born after his being King succeeded him in the Throne.</P>
<P>They never gave the Crown to a one-ey'd, squint-ey'd, or deformed Person, as appears by the squinting Son of <HI>Cahade</HI> or <HI>Robad,</HI> who notwith∣standing he was a valiant Man, yet for the Ble∣mish in his Sight was disinherited. But when the <HI>Persian</HI> Monarchy began to decay, this Custom was laid aside, and the Crown became elective; but the Nobility, who had Voices therein, still reserv'd it for those who were of Royal Extract.</P>
<P>Natural Sons succeeded not their Fathers in the Throne, so long as there remain'd any that were legitimate; yet notwithstanding the illegitimate <HI>Darius</HI> was chosen before <HI>Isogee,</HI> lawful Son to <HI>Artaxerxes.</HI></P>
<P>When the King at any time went out of his Dominions, he was oblig'd to nominate a Deputy to Govern during his absence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies at Installing the King.</NOTE>The Kings were by the Priests of their Coun∣trey with great Ceremony Inaugurated after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> They were led into a Temple of a warlike Goddess, where they pull'd off their Clothes, and put on those which <HI>Cyrus</HI> us'd to wear when he was but a private Person; which done they are a few Figs, chew'd a little Turpen∣tine, and drank a draught of sower Milk.</P>
<P>They incircled the Heads of these new Kings with a Crown or Mitre, and a <HI>Cydaris,</HI> which was made of Purple, and ty'd with a blue Ribbon mix'd with white.</P>
<P>King <HI>Sapor</HI> instead of a Crown wore a Cap made like a Rams Head, beset with Precious Stones. They also wore a <HI>Tiara</HI> or <HI>Turbant,</HI> like those which the Magistrates of the several Pro∣vinces wore, but with this distinction, that those of the Kings stood upright, and the other bended behind.</P>
<P>The Honor of putting the Crown on the Kings Head belong'd to a peculiar Person call'd <HI>Surene,</HI> who was the second Nobleman in the Kingdom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habit or Robes of the King.</NOTE>The Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> also wore a long Vest, hanging below their Ancles, which was embroi∣der'd with several Representations of Birds, Beasts, and the like, and beset with Gold and Precious Jems. They likewise wore a Coat with Sleeves, call'd <HI>Candis,</HI> differing from those of the other <HI>Persians,</HI> both in colour (being Purple) and value: moreover, the Subjects durst not approach any Man without hiding their Hands in their Sleeves, but the Kings held them out. The Kings Habit, as <HI>Xenophon</HI> says, was also half purple and half white, which none else might wear. They like∣wise wore long Hair, Pendants, a Girdle, and long Stockings like the other <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P>They were honor'd like Gods, for those that approach'd them, bow'd not onely their Heads and Bodies, but fell flat on their Faces, with their Hands upon their Backs; in which posture they lay as long as they suppos'd him to be in sight; which was also perform'd by Strangers, who were not permitted to see the King, unless they pro∣mis'd to worship him after the <HI>Persian</HI> manner, for otherwise they were forc'd to let him know their Business by Proxy, or else in Writing; which when he perus'd, he return'd his Answer without being seen.</P>
<P>Those that Saluted the King, wish'd him <HI>Ever∣lasting Life and perpetual Government;</HI> but he sel∣dom appear'd to his People, who were not per∣mitted to set a Foot into the Royal Palace without his Majesty's leave; but his Noblemen waited without at the Door to receive his Commands. His Throne was of massie Gold, which none durst touch; and if at any time the King went abroad, they strew'd the Streets and Ways which he was to pass with Flowers; and every where burnt Per∣fumes. They likewise kept the Kings Birth-day every year with making of Offerings, and other great testimonies of joy, and whence dy'd, the whole Kingdom Mourn'd for five days together; during which time all Courts of Judicature were shut up.</P>

Their Royal Palaces were very stately and magnificent, having many great Officers attendant, insomuch that <HI>Apuleius</HI> call'd them <HI>The Houses of Gold.</HI></P>
<P>They would never eat of any other Bread but what was brought out of the Province of <HI>Aeolia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> and of all things the Kingdom afforded the First-fruits were sent to the King; also their Salt <HI>Ar∣moniack</HI> was brought to them out of <HI>Egypt.</HI> They drank of the Wine <HI>Chaliboonien,</HI> brought from <HI>Assyria,</HI> and no other Water but what was taken out of the Stream <HI>Choaspes,</HI> which glides by <HI>Susa.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of those Places through which they travell'd always Entertain'd them at a Ban∣quet, on which they spent above twenty or thirty Talents. They generally Din'd alone, but some∣times their Wives and Children were permitted to sit with them at their Table, as also the Kings Mother and Brothers. If the King invited any to eat with him, they sat with a Curtain drawn be∣tween them in such a manner, that the King could see them and not be seen again.</P>
<P>King <HI>Cyrus</HI> (as <HI>Xenophon</HI> observ'd) plac'd those in whom he repos'd greatest confidence, on his left, and others on his right side, because (they say) the left side lies more open to those that design to do Mischief than the right.</P>
<P>But these Entertainments were without free∣dom, because the Guests were forc'd to cat with bowing Heads, and cast-down Eyes.</P>
<P>The Kings never appear'd on foot to the Peo∣ple, but always came out of the Palaces either in a Coach, or else on Horseback.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their care in visiting their Provinces.</NOTE>They were wont to visit their several Provin∣ces, or else to send faithful Lieutenants to such Places where they could not go themselves, to give order to all Husbandmen to let no Ground lie waste, that the Merchants should promote their Traffick, and Handicraftsmen be diligent in fol∣lowing their Employments, that so they might be the better able to pay them their Tribute.</P>
<P>They also kept several Noblemen call'd <HI>Megi∣stanes,</HI> who always waited at their Doors to re∣ceive their Commands, besides the <HI>Surene</HI> or Ma∣gistrate, who set the Crown on the Kings Head, and several who constantly attended to receive Ambassadors, or all such as had Business with the
<PB N="82" REF="69"/>King, into whose Presence they could not be per∣mitted without them.</P>
<P>Great numbers of Eunuchs were also kept at the Kings Court, who attended on the Queens and Concubines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Se∣cretaries.</NOTE>The Kings likewise kept their Secretaries, who going into the Wars with them, writ down all the Passages thereof, as also the Edicts or Letters Patents which were given to the Governors, the beginning whereof were to this effect, <HI>The King saith thus.</HI> Moreover, when he writ to his Com∣manders, he wish'd them Peace, as also they to him. His Letters were not onely written in one Language, but in the several Languages of those People whom they Govern'd.</P>
<P>There were also some, whose Office it was to tell the King the hour of the day, and many other such like Officers, amongst whom were some call'd <HI>The Eyes and Ears of the King.</HI></P>
<P>Those Kings that liv'd lasciviously, endeavor'd to die without pain, by means of a Poyson which they kept onely for themselves and their Mothers. This Poyson was made of the Dung of a small <HI>Indian</HI> Bird call'd <HI>Dicodre,</HI> a piece whereof about the bigness of a Barley-corn being put into their Liquor, caus'd them to die an easie, and also a sudden Death.</P>
<P>They had stately Tombs at <HI>Persepolis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Tombs</NOTE> <HI>Pasarga∣des,</HI> and <HI>Ecbatane,</HI> on all which were Motto's and Inscriptions Engraven.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Education of their Sons.</NOTE>The Kings Sons were highly reverenc'd, and taught in the seventh year of their Age to Hunt and Ride the great Horse: The eldest, who was to succeed in the Throne, was in his four∣teenth year committed to the Charge of four Tutors, who amongst the <HI>Persians</HI> were accounted the most wise, just, sober, and valiant Men in their Dominions; the first taught him Wisdom, and the Rules of Government; the second admoni∣shed him to affect Truth; the third, to curb the Desires of the Flesh; and the fourth, to fear no∣thing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reward of approved Counsel.</NOTE>If it hapned that any Man undertook to give the King Advice or Counsel in Business of great consequence, he was plac'd on a square Cushion of Gold, which he was permitted to carry away with him if his Advice was approv'd of, but if not, he was whipt about the Court.</P>
<P>One of the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber wak'd the King every Morning, and desir'd him to rise and mind the Concerns of the Kingdom, which the God <HI>Merosomasdes</HI> had given to him.</P>
<P>They themselves judg'd and determin'd Causes, pass'd the Sentence of Death on Criminals, whom they kept some time in Prison before they were Executed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Division of the Coun∣trey.</NOTE>The whole Kingdom was divided into <HI>Satra∣pia's,</HI> Counties or Lordships, though Writers dif∣fer in the number of them: for (as some affirm) <HI>Darius</HI> divided the same first into 360 Lordships, over which three more principal <HI>Satrapae</HI> were plac'd. Others write, that <HI>Darius</HI> had onely a hundred and twelve <HI>Satrapia's</HI> or Lordships, whose Governors were forc'd to give an Account of their Government to the first three. Some also make more, and others less. But after the <HI>Parthi∣ans</HI> had made themselves Masters of <HI>Persia,</HI> they divided the whole Realm into twenty <HI>Satrapia's,</HI> several of them being Govern'd by one Person.</P>
<P>These Lordships were given to the Kings Sons, and the King often in his Will gave all the Cities thereof to his youngest Son.</P>
<P>The Office of these Governors was to Com∣mand the Inhabitants, protect their Goods, ga∣ther in the Revenues, and advise the King of all Transactions.</P>
<P>Besides these Governors of Countreys there were others, who order'd Husbandmen, Trades∣men, and other People, to be diligent in their Employments, and not be idle; and others were Commanded to prevent the Soldiers, or any Enemy from oppressing the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>In this place it will not be amiss to subjoin the several Dynasties of the Kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> that have had the Government of this renowned Empire, wherein by way of Entrance we will note, That when this Countrey was first peopled, the several Tribes were under the Command of their own Princes, among which was <HI>Chedorlaomer,</HI> who was overthrown by <HI>Abraham,</HI> as holy Writ mentions: By this means their Princes were scarce known till the time of <HI>Perses,</HI> who wrested the same from <HI>Sardanapalus,</HI> the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Monarch, and first laid the Foundation of this great Empire, in whose Race it continu'd six Descents in this Or∣der:</P>

<P>This Countrey of <HI>Georgia</HI> is very fertile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Fertility.</NOTE> and in many places produces plenty of Corn, Wine, and other Fruits. Most of the Vines grow up by the Trees. There are likewise many Woods and Mountains, and abundance of Mulberry-ttees for the feeding of Silk-worms, which furnish <HI>Persia</HI> with great quantities of Silk.</P>
<P>Wild Beasts are also here in great numbers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Beasts.</NOTE> and likewise Faulcons and Eagles, which they call <HI>Avigi.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Cyrus</HI> or <HI>Cur,</HI> which the Natives of the Countrey call <HI>Ser,</HI> the <HI>Turks Chur,</HI> and others <HI>Elkar,</HI> takes its original with the <HI>Araxes</HI> out of Mount <HI>Taurus</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> from whence it glides down to the Plains of <HI>Georgia,</HI> where augmented with the Waters of many Rivers, and at last united with the <HI>Araxes,</HI> disembogues into the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI></P>
<P>There are also two very eminent Lakes; the one call'd <HI>Geluchalatdu,</HI> in the North, is four days Journey in circumference, and hath on its Banks the Castle of <HI>St. Leonard;</HI> the other nam'd <HI>Esechie,</HI> is taken for the ancient Lake <HI>Licinitis.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The People very cour∣teous.</NOTE>The <HI>Georgians</HI> are very civil and courteous after their manner. The Nobles are call'd <HI>Asnaure,</HI> which going continually Arm'd, always maintain War against the Unbelievers or <HI>Mahumetans:</HI> But they are not so much inclin'd to Learning, as the <HI>Greeks;</HI> neither are they so ambitious, proud, and subtle, but very meek and honest, of an affable nature, and so easie of belief, that their greatest misfortunes have fall'n upon them from the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> through their too much credulity.</P>
<P><HI>Cootwick</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Georgians</HI> are much inclin'd to Drinking, and that they will not En∣gage with an Enemy before they have drank their Fill. The Women are very courteous, civil, mo∣dest, and the best featur'd in all <HI>Asia;</HI> both Men and Women are tall and slender, having generally brown Hair, black full Eyes, white and ruddy Complexions, occasion'd perhaps by the abundance of Wine which they drink.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lan∣guage one through the whole Coun∣trey.</NOTE>Through the whole Countrey is but one sort of Language spoken, which being peculiar and com∣mon to these People, is by them call'd <HI>Cardueli;</HI> it is written with two distinct Characters or Letters, the one call'd <HI>Cudsuri,</HI> which is us'd onely in godly Books, and in their Churches; and the other <HI>Chedroli,</HI> is us'd in all other Affairs.</P>
<P>The Alphabet of the vulgar <HI>Georgians</HI> hath thirty six Letters, shap'd like those represented in the Sculp.</P>
<P><HI>Figueroa</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Georgian</HI> Characters differ from the <HI>Caldean, Hebrew,</HI> and <HI>Armenian,</HI> and that they write like the <HI>Europeans,</HI> from the left hand to the right.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</NOTE>The <HI>Georgians</HI> receiv'd the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion in the time of the Emperor <HI>Constantine</HI> (who kept his Court at <HI>Constantinople,</HI>) from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> by means of a strange Slavess, of whom they relate many great Wonders, but to this day none of them know her Name; yet the <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> in their Book of Martyrs, call her <HI>Ancella.</HI> And as they receiv'd the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> so they likewise observe their Church Ceremonies and Liturgies. They perform Divine Service in their own Language, and not in the
<PB N="87" REF="71"/><HI>Greek,</HI> as <HI>Minadoi</HI> and others affirm; nor do they boast the antiquity of their Church, as the <HI>Greeks</HI> do; and though they acknowledge the Patri∣arch of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> yet nevertheless they are not subject to him, for they chuse their own Church-Rulers. They bear great reverence to <HI>Rome, St. Peter, St. Paul,</HI> and the Pope, to whom (contrary to the <HI>Greeks</HI>) they attribute the anti∣quity of their Church. They shun the company of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and abhor their Superstition, but affect, the <HI>Latines</HI> and <HI>Roman-Catholicks;</HI> and what Conquests soever the <HI>Turks</HI> and other People have gain'd over them, yet they have always re∣main'd firm in the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith; and though their Princes have very often apostatiz'd, and forc'd many after several ways to change their Opinions, yet nevertheless the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion hath gotten the upper hand, and the <HI>Christians</HI> have regain'd the Dominions which they had lost, or forc'd their Princes again to embrace <HI>Christia∣nity,</HI> which they had forsaken.</P>
<P>Many Ways lead into <HI>Georgia,</HI> especially three, the first and shortest whereof is through <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> from whence they travel thither by Land, <HI>viz.</HI> through <HI>Scutarie</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI> with the Caravans, who go along the Way of <HI>Trabizonde,</HI> and finish their Journey in a Moneth; though it is much shorter over the <HI>Black Sea, viz.</HI> in five or six days, more or less, according to the Season. The second Way is through <HI>Persia,</HI> from whence they go easi∣ly with the Caravans into the Prince <HI>Luarsab</HI>'s Countrey. The third and last Way is through <HI>Poland</HI> cross the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> from whence in a few days you arrive in <HI>Georgia,</HI> as we said before.</P>

<P>Formerly the Princes of <HI>Dadian</HI> and <HI>Guriel</HI> were subject to the Prince of <HI>Basciaciuk</HI> or <HI>Imereti,</HI> and serv'd him as Gentlemen of the Horse, one holding his Stirrup, and the other the Bridle, when he mounted on Horseback; but being of late grown more powerful, they have not onely freed them∣selves from his Authority, but made themselves his Equals; nay, by their Warring against him, are fear'd, not onely by him, but by other neigh∣boring Princes.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1622. when the Prince of <HI>Dadian</HI> had obtain'd a Victory against the Prince of <HI>Imereti,</HI> and done him much hurt, he forc'd him to send Agents into <HI>Persia,</HI> to request Aid there, with pro∣mise to become Tributary to the <HI>Sofi,</HI> if he would send him the Soldiers which lay in Garrison in the Towns of <HI>Teflis</HI> and <HI>Gori,</HI> under the Command of a <HI>Georgian</HI> Nobleman call'd <HI>Battoni Mehrab;</HI> but <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> receiv'd the Message with much dis∣pleasure, refusing their Presents and Request, say∣ing that they did it out of a private Design and treacherous Intention; yet proffer'd him some <HI>Persian</HI> Soldiers; but the King disliking to admit Strangers into his Countrey, refus'd that Offer, and Espous'd one of the Prince of <HI>Dadian</HI>'s Sisters, so closing the Breach that had been made upon him.</P>

That they should be his if he could make them come: Upon which the King sending for them, they in obedience to his Command were coming, but seeing the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army so near, durst not de∣clare themselves for the <HI>Persians,</HI> but flatter'd the one as well as the other, excusing themselves to the <HI>Persians,</HI> but came not into his Army, which highly incens'd the King against them, and as soon as a Peace was concluded, and the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army gone out of his Dominions, the King of <HI>Persia</HI> growing subtilly malicious, and plotting Revenge, sow'd the Seeds of Contention between <HI>Luarzab</HI> and <HI>Teimuraz,</HI> and at last wrought it to that heighth, that they fell to open War one with ano∣ther, notwithstanding they were nearly related (for <HI>Teimuraz</HI> his second Wife was Sister to <HI>Luar∣zab</HI>) and had undoubtedly given Battel to one an∣other, their Armies being already drawn into the Field, if they had not been prevented by means of some faithful Councellors, who offering them∣selves to be Mediators between them in order to a Reconciliation, discover'd to them, that their Difference was occasion'd by the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> who sought nothing but their utter ruine.</P>
<P>Moreover, the King of <HI>Persia</HI> bred also Discon∣tent and Difference between <HI>Teimuraz</HI> and his Mother <HI>Ketevan Dedupali,</HI> or <HI>Queen Ketevan,</HI> who then was a Widow: for he perswaded <HI>Teimuraz</HI> into a belief, that she was resolv'd to Marry with an eminent Commander, in whom for his valor and grand policy in State Affairs she repos'd great confidence; and that she endeavor'd first to de∣stroy him, that so she might bestow the Realm on another Son, which she might have by her se∣cond Husband; all which so incens'd the inno∣cent <HI>Teimuraz,</HI> that he caus'd the foremention'd Commander, who was the prime Man of the Countrey, to be put to death, and took the Go∣vernment from his Mother; but being young, un∣experienc'd and little regarded by his Nobility, he found himself involv'd in great troubles: for the King of <HI>Persia</HI> still prosecuted his Design, ma∣king him to be despis'd, and esteem'd but a Child amongst the Nobles, who whensoe're they came into <HI>Persia,</HI> were courteously receiv'd by the King, who also gave them great Presents, and permit∣ted them to use their own Religion, which high∣ly satisfi'd and pleas'd them; and by this means they grew Strangers to their natural Prince.

But though they could not keep the Countrey, yet they would not lose so great a Booty of so many brave People as they had taken, and such as perhaps were worth more to them than the Countrey it self: for which rea∣son they forc'd them all, both Men and Women, as well Noble as Ignoble, great and small, with what Moveables they were able to carry, to for∣sake their native Countrey, whil'st the King's Army marching behind, drove them into <HI>Persia,</HI> where afterwards they were sent into several Pro∣vinces remote from <HI>Georgia;</HI> and by this means the Provinces of <HI>Persia</HI> proper, <HI>Kirman</HI> or <HI>Garma∣nia, Mazanderan</HI> at the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> and many more, are at this day so full of <HI>Georgian</HI> and <HI>Cir∣cassian</HI> Inhabitants; amongst whom the Vulgar who are the greatest number, remain <HI>Christians,</HI> yet are but meanly instructed, by reason their Pa∣stors are both few and ignorant; but the No∣bles, and most of the Soldiers, as also many of the common People, stirr'd up partly by ambition, and partly out of covetousness, hoping that by changing their Religion they might obtain some∣thing from the King, who was always favorable to such Apostates, and gave them Gifts continu∣ally, to draw them to his Opinion, and partly forc'd thereto by necessity, are turn'd <HI>Mahume∣tans.</HI></P>
<P>With these kind of People the King's Army was so much increas'd, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1622. he had above thirty thousand <HI>Georgians,</HI> besides a great number of <HI>Circassians,</HI> and some strange <HI>Armeni∣ans,</HI> some of which bore the chief Command, as well in the Army as Civil Government of the Countrey, and were rais'd to many of the highest Dignities, as <HI>Sultans</HI> and <HI>Chans.</HI> But besides these, a great number of them, not onely of the Vulgar, but also of the Nobility, who resisting the <HI>Persians</HI> at their coming into <HI>Georgia,</HI> were subdu'd, and by force brought from thence, and made perpetual Slaves; the number whereof was formerly so great, that there was scarce a House in all <HI>Persia</HI> which was not full of them.</P>

<P>The Air of this Province is very moist by rea∣son of its Situation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air.</NOTE> for on the one side it hath Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> out of which flow many Streams. The Woods with which it is overgrown prevent the swift passing of the Clouds, and the nearness of the Sea, and constant Winds which blow from the same, bring commonly Mists and Rain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabi∣tants afflicted with many Diseases.</NOTE>The Inhabitants are generally troubled with the Spleen, which turns to the Dropsie, if they use not good Medicines. The Tertian and Quartan Agues are also very common here. Ancient Peo∣ple commonly die of Rheums and Apoplexies; Youth of the Jaundise and Dropsie.</P>
<P>The Cold is also very great here, though there is no appearance of it till the latter end of <HI>Decem∣ber;</HI> from which time there likewise falls abun∣dance of Snow, till <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey is very Morassie near the Sea, but very Hilly up into the Inland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers in this Countrey.</NOTE><HI>Mengrelia</HI> is also divided by several Rivers, which, like most of the great Rivers of <HI>Asia,</HI> have their head Springs in Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> and disem∣bogue into the <HI>Black Sea.</HI> The first of them, which rises Eastward, is the Stream by the Ancients call'd <HI>Fasis,</HI> and now <HI>Faso</HI> or <HI>Fas,</HI> by the <HI>Scythians</HI> (according to <HI>Thevet</HI>) <HI>Debbassetcha,</HI> and by the In∣habitants, <HI>Rione,</HI> which (as <HI>Procopius</HI> affirms) falls with such force and violence into the Sea, that it makes the Water fresh for some Miles. But this is contradicted by <HI>Agricola:</HI> And <HI>Archangel Lam∣berti,</HI> who hath seen the same several times, says this River at first runs very swift from its Fountain Head, but coming amongst the Plains, it is so slow, that 'tis scarce discern'd to move, and yet certain it is, that its Water doth not commix with the Sea.</P>
<P>The Stream <HI>Faso</HI> disembogues it self into the Sea through two Mouths, between which it makes an Island, by the Ancients call'd <HI>Ea,</HI> wherein the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year 1578. built a Fort, which was since pull'd down. At the same time the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor <HI>Amurat</HI> took the City <HI>Teflis</HI> from the <HI>Persians,</HI> supposing it would have been a very con∣venient Harbor for him to keep his Galleys in, that from thence they might go with the more ease to conquer <HI>Persia</HI> (which then he design'd) and make himself Master of the City <HI>Colatis,</HI> the En∣trance and Key into the Countrey on that side; to which purpose his Galleys also went a great way up the Stream: But the <HI>Georgians</HI> having for∣tifi'd themselves at the Entrance of the River, where it is narrowest, Entertain'd them so rough∣ly, that they forc'd them to return. Above the Island the Stream is above half a Mile broad, where its Banks are also overgrown with Trees, and frequented by Fishermen, who come thither to catch Sturgeon. Farther up into the River lie many small Islands, of which several are Inhabi∣ted: To each House which is built on the same belongs a small Barque, made of a hollow Tree, in which the Women Row from place to place.</P>
<P><HI>Arrianus,</HI> who by the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI>'s Com∣mand went to discover this River, saith in one of his Letters, that on the left side of the Mouth of the River he saw the Image of the Goddess <HI>Rhea</HI> in a Temple, which in the time of the Emperor Emperor <HI>Zenon</HI> was Dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Recas.</HI></P>
<P>The next River is <HI>Sceni-Skari,</HI> that is, <HI>The Horse-River,</HI> by reason of its swiftness.</P>
<P><HI>Arrianus,</HI> and all those Geographers that fol∣low him, place other Rivers between the <HI>Faso</HI> and <HI>Sceni,</HI> but by mistake: for it is certain, that the <HI>Sceni</HI> is the first Stream which falls into the <HI>Faso,</HI> but afterwards receives the <HI>Abassin</HI> and <HI>Tachut;</HI> the <HI>Abassin</HI> is the <HI>Glaucus</HI> of <HI>Strabo,</HI> and the <HI>Tachut</HI> the <HI>Sigam</HI> of <HI>Arrian,</HI> though he places it towards <HI>Copo.</HI></P>
<P>There is at this day another Tract of Land, through which this Stream flowing receives its Denomination.</P>

<PB N="91" REF="75"/>Inhabitants call the same <HI>Ciani Skari,</HI> and in the Maps <HI>Cianeus,</HI> from a People which dwell on its Banks, and come very often to Trade in <HI>Mengrelia.</HI></P>
<P>Next follows the River <HI>Enguria,</HI> anciently call'd <HI>Asteltes,</HI> which <HI>Arrian</HI> places near the <HI>Cia∣neus:</HI> It falls with extraordinary swiftness from the Mountains inhabited by the <HI>Sovanies,</HI> and swelling with the melted Snow that likewise glides from them, to that heighth, that it cannot be cross'd without a Barque.</P>
<P>The next in order to the <HI>Enguria,</HI> is the Rivu∣let <HI>Heti,</HI> which is not found in the Maps by reason of its smalness, but is very eminent for a strange sort of Fish which is taken therein: It discharges its Water into the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> at a place call'd <HI>Gah∣bidas.</HI></P>
<P>Another River nam'd <HI>d'Ochums</HI> glides through a Tract of Land call'd <HI>Tarscen,</HI> from which per∣haps the Name <HI>Tarsura</HI> had its original, and by which it is mention'd in the Maps.</P>
<P>The next is the <HI>Echalis;</HI> and after that the Stream <HI>Moquis,</HI> which borrows its Denomination from the City and Bishoprick of <HI>Moquis,</HI> through which it passes.</P>
<P>The last is the Stream call'd <HI>Coddors,</HI> anciently <HI>Corax.</HI> This divides <HI>Mengrelia</HI> from the <HI>Abascians,</HI> as the <HI>Fasis</HI> from <HI>Guriel</HI> and <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P>In many places of <HI>Mengrelia</HI> are great Lakes, especially on the Plains where the Ground sounds hollow when any one Rides over it, which is no small testimony of the affinity between the <HI>Black</HI> and <HI>Caspian Seas;</HI> to which may be added, that in these two Seas one sort of Fishes are found: for there is abundance of Sturgeon in the <HI>Black</HI> as well as in the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sorts of Sturgeon.</NOTE>At the Mouth of the <HI>Paso</HI> and <HI>Enguria,</HI> the In∣habitants catch abundance of Sturgeon from <HI>April</HI> till <HI>August,</HI> of which they have three sorts, one of which call'd <HI>Zuthi,</HI> being of a far better taste than the rest, is carry'd to the Court, and dres'd for the King's Table. The second sort call'd <HI>An∣giachia,</HI> differs not much from the first, onely it is the bigger, and the Flesh not altogether so good. The third sort nam'd <HI>Poronci</HI> is yet larger, and al∣most like a Buffalo, but its Flesh is not compara∣ble to the other. The Inhabitants cut these Fish into pieces of two Hands breadth, which the Salting, dry in the Sun, and afterwards use as Rarity. Of the Rocs they make <HI>Caveare,</HI> which putting into small Vessels, they Salt, setting it in the Sun till it condense into a Body or thick Sub∣stance. The least Sturgeon call'd <HI>Zuthi,</HI> hath a bigger Roe than the rest, neither is any part of thrown away but the flat Bones which stick in the top of the Skin, besides which it hath no other except a Gristle about a Finger thick, which ex∣tends from the Head to the Tail.</P>
<P>The Fishermen have certain signs whereby to know when it is best Fishing, as by the hollow∣ness of the Water, which from the melted Snow falling into the same, is greedily coveted by the Sturgeon.</P>
<P>They also take here another sort of Fish call'd <HI>Suia,</HI> and by the <HI>Turks, Calcan Baluch,</HI> which signi∣fies a Pilcher, being exactly of that form, and co∣ver'd with little Scales, but hath two Eyes on one side, the one grey and the other white.</P>
<P>This Fishing begins in <HI>December,</HI> and continues till <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>In some Seasons there are abundance of Her∣rings in this Sea, and the greater the number of them is, the more Sturgeons they are sure to catch that year.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1642. the Sea had thrown so great a num∣ber of Herrings on the Shore between <HI>Trebizonde</HI> and the Countrey of the <HI>Abcassians,</HI> that they lay above half a yard thick upon one another, like a Bank.</P>
<P>There are also Oysters, which the Fishermen throw into the Sea again when they catch them in their Nets; yet some of them have course Pearls in them, such as <HI>Pliny</HI> writes he saw in the <HI>Bosphorus</HI> of <HI>Thracia.</HI></P>
<P>The Rivers are full of <HI>Voorn,</HI> of which there are two sorts, the one call'd <HI>Calmakka,</HI> is very small, and the other <HI>Aragoli,</HI> which is bigger; the first sort are catch'd in the North Sea, and the other onely in the Rivers; in which, and on whose Banks are likewise Beavers, contrary to <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s opinion, who affirms, that no four-footed Beasts can live in the Sea.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Venison car∣ry'd hence in∣to <HI>Greece.</HI></NOTE>The Countrey abounds also with all manner of Venison, and great numbers of Pheasants, which Bird hath its Denomination from the Ri∣ver <HI>Fasis,</HI> about whose Banks it breeds, as also through all <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> from whence (if <HI>Marshal</HI> may be credited) the <HI>Argonautes</HI> carry'd them into <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>There are all manner of Birds of prey, but especially Goshawks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds▪</NOTE> which they teach in eight days time, and use for the taking of Quails, whose Season being over, they set them at liberty to seek for their Food where they can get it.</P>
<P>Eagles are likewise very common here, and are taken by the Inhabitants onely for their Wings, the Feathers whereof they fallen to their long Arrows.</P>
<P>Every Man in <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> though never so poor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> keeps a Horse, for it costs them nothing. Some Noblemen have two hundred, and the Prince himself two thousand, which are every year Train'd in the Field; they never shoe them but in the time of War.</P>
<P>Sheep do not thrive well in this Countrey, by reason of the moistness thereof, yet their Wooll is exceeding fine.</P>
<P>In the Mountains breeds also a certain Beast, which is half like a Goat, and half like a Stag, and of the same bigness, with brown Hair; its Horns are like a Goats, bending backwards. The Flesh of this Beast is very delicate, and accounted bet∣ter than that of a Stag. They also breed in <HI>Cir∣cassia.</HI></P>
<P>There are likewise all sorts of wild Beasts which are in <HI>Europe,</HI> and many white Bears, espe∣cially on the Mountain <HI>Cyrus,</HI> which seem to be peculiar to that place, because there are none in any of the neighboring parts.</P>
<P>On the Borders of the <HI>Abcassians</HI> are said to breed wild Buffalo's and Wolves, which do great mischief to the grazing Cattel, which get toge∣ther in a Body, and defend themselves with their Heels.</P>
<P>There are no Foxes, but a Beast call'd <HI>Tourra,</HI> which resembles them, but are somewhat big∣ger, and hath more shaggy Hair; they go toge∣ther in Herds, and make a great noise in the Night; they are very mischievous, besides their Prey carrying away Shoes, Boots, or other Ap∣parel, from such People as lodge in the Fields.</P>
<P>This Countrey hath great variety of Fruits.</P>
<P>On the Banks of the River <HI>Fasis</HI> grows sweet Wood.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="76"/>
<P>In this Countrey is also the best Honey in the whole World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Honey.</NOTE> although <HI>Strabo</HI> and some of the an∣cient Writers affirm that it is very unwholsom, and causes vertiginous swimmings in the Head.</P>
<P>They have also another sort of white and hard Honey, like Sugar: Its colour perhaps caus'd <HI>Pliny</HI> to affirm, that there bred white Bees about the <HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI> or <HI>Black Sea;</HI> which the In∣habitants contradict, affirming, that the Bees which make this Honey are like others, and that the whiteness thereof proceeds from the abundance of Dew which falls in this Countrey, out of which the Bees extract the Honey. This white Honey is much coveted in this Countrey, but not carry'd to <HI>Constantinople</HI> like the other, because gather'd in Winter, when they drive no Trade, the Sea being lock'd up. The Inhabitants oftentimes put their Honey into the Rind or Shells of bitter <HI>Citrullen,</HI> from whence <HI>Strabo</HI> writes, that the Honey which is gather'd on the Mountains in the time when the Lawrel blossoms, makes all those vomit that eat of the same, and therefore is taken by them for a Vomit in Physick.</P>
<P>It is certainly believ'd, that there is plenty of Gold and Silver on that part of Mount <HI>Caucasus</HI> which verges this Countrey, but the Inhabitants conceal it, because they would not intice the <HI>Turks</HI> thither.</P>
<P>They get abundance of Gold near the City <HI>Arudan,</HI> in the Province formerly subject to the Prince <HI>Artabegi.</HI> There is also Antimony.</P>
<P>Some have reported, that the Prince of <HI>Imereti</HI> keeps divers Men at work in the Mines in his Dominions, but so privately, that he caus'd one of his Subjects resident in <HI>Dadian,</HI> at his Return from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> whither he had carry'd a Proof of the Gold and Silver which was digg'd out of those Mines, to have his Hands and Feet cut off, as a Punishment for his holding Correspondence with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>They say there is also a Gold-Mine in the Bishoprick of <HI>Cavis.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several sorts of <HI>Mengre∣lians.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Mengrelians</HI> are of several Degrees and Qualities; the first call'd <HI>Ginasca,</HI> are eminent Lords; the second <HI>Ginandi,</HI> are Nobles; the third <HI>Sakkurs,</HI> are the Rich; and the fourth nam'd <HI>Moinalli,</HI> are the Commonalty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ginasca</HI> onely attend upon the Prince, and are themselves serv'd by the <HI>Ginandi;</HI> and these again are waited upon by the <HI>Sakkurs</HI> and <HI>Moi∣nalli.</HI></P>
<P>None can attain to a higher degree of Honor than the Family in which they were born: for he that is born amongst the Commonalty can never rise higher, though he be the richest Man in the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moinalli,</HI> or common sort of People, do all servile Offices for the Nobility, <HI>viz.</HI> chop their Wood, follow them on foot, carry their Baggage when they travel, and the like, The richest of them must give a Cow, a Basket full of Corn, Bread, Wine, and Fruits, for an acknowledgment of their Vassalage; nay further, they must Lodge all Strangers which the Nobility send to them, and also Entertain their Landlords whensoe're they are minded to visit them.</P>
<P>When a Family of the Peasants is wholly ex∣tinct, their Lords inherit their Goods; and some∣times when all are dead except one, they sell him to the <HI>Turks;</HI> so that their greatest Riches con∣sists in having many Slaves.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Mengrelians</HI> spend their time in Tilling and Manuring their Lands, and the rather, because they have no manner of Corn brought them from any other Parts. Their greatest Labor after they have Sow'd their Corn, is Weeding; to which purpose the Fields are always full of Workmen, who are Entertain'd by their Master with great Feasting: for after their Day-labor is finish'd, they go Singing to his House, where is provided for them great store of Meat, as also Wine; which that they may not want at that time, they generally in Harvest-time Consecrate some Tuns of their best to <HI>St. George,</HI> with promise not to taste it till the Feast-day of <HI>St. Peter</HI> and <HI>St. Paul,</HI> which is the time before mention'd; but when that is come, they bring a Priest in all his Ha∣bits into their Wine-Cellar, where reciting some Prayers, he broaches the Cask, and sends a Pot full of the Wine to <HI>St. George</HI>'s Church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first Money.</NOTE>Before Prince <HI>Dadian</HI> invited the <HI>Armenians</HI> to Trade in his Countrey, there was no Money, but they barter'd Commodities for Commodities; but this Prince, to his great benefit and advantage, caus'd a Coin to be made with <HI>Arabian</HI> Hierogly∣phicks, like that which passes in <HI>Persia,</HI> and is call'd <HI>Abassi;</HI> notwithstanding the Inhabitants rather affect Pieces of Eight, and other strange Coin.</P>
<P>They Trade with the <HI>Turks</HI> in several places, and at several Fairs, the biggest whereof is kept in <HI>September,</HI> just before the Church of <HI>Cipourias</HI> and the other in <HI>St. George</HI>'s Church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade with the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Turks</HI> about this time coming from <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> bring Carpets, Stools, Bowes, Arrows, Cloth, Iron, Copper, Wooll, Cotton-Clothes, Salt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which they carry back Honey, Flax, Yarn, Swords, Beaver Skins, Slaves, and Box∣wood, by which they gain great Sums of Money: for 'tis evident, that for every four hundred Crowns-worth of Salt which they bring into this Countrey, they get above five thousand of Wood.</P>
<P>The Lords sell their Subjects for Slaves to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Men their Wives, whereof the chief Lord of the Soil always receives a third part, the Parents of the Women another part, and the Husband the rest.</P>
<P>A Nobleman once having a mind to a <HI>Turkish</HI> Horse, gave his own Mother in Exchange for him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mengrelians,</HI> who account it a happiness to change their Habitations when they please,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> like the <HI>Tartars,</HI> never bestow any great cost on their Buildings, notwithstanding they have all manner of Materials to Build withal, but especially good white Stone. Common Houses are not divided into several Apartments, but consist in one large Room, in which the Master, Mistress, Servants, and all, both Men and Women, dwell together. They always keep a great Fire in the middle of the Hall in the Winter. The Walls of their Houses are of Wood, and the Roofs cover'd with Straw, which makes them very subject to take fire. Their Halls are generally full of Smoak, and dark, having no other Light than what comes in at the Door. They leave these Houses with great willingness, whensoe're they are minded to remove.</P>
<P>In the Winter they commonly goe into the Woods, where being secur'd from the sharp Winds, they spend their time in Hunting. In the Summer they dwell on the Hills, and in the Spring and Harvest they chuse such places for their abode, where they may have the benefit
<PB N="93" REF="76"/>both of warm Weather and cold but they al∣ways dwell a great distance from the Sea, partly for the bad Aire, and partly to be secure from the Invasion of Pyrates.</P>
<P>Before Noblemens Houses are generally large Squares, surrounded with Moats and Gardens, planted full of Trees; round about the Squares are built divers Lodges at a certain distance one from the other to prevent Fire; that which stands next to the Entrance is call'd <HI>Ochus,</HI> where they receive all Strangers, the rest serving either for Cellars, Kitchins, and Wardrobes, which being stronger than the rest, are built in the form of a Tower. In the middle of all these Lodges or little Houses, which stand round about the Garden inclosing the Square, there commonly stands a Chappel, wherein they all go to Mass.</P>
<P>The common People are generally very poor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habits.</NOTE> wearing onely a woollen Lappet about their Bo∣dies, from their middle down to their Knees. Per∣sons of Quality Clothe themselves in foreign Stuffs, but wear a Girdle cover'd with a Plate, at which they hang their Sword, and all other things which are requisite to be us'd on a Journey, <HI>viz.</HI> a Knife, a Hone, a Leather of three Inches broad, and half a Yard long, a Tinder-box, a lit∣tle Bag full of Salt, and another full of Pepper and other Spices, and a Wax Candle. The Shirts which they wear are wrought with Gold at the bottom and about their Necks, and hang out over their Knees; their upper Garment is also shorter than their Shirts. In cold Weather they wear Furr'd Coats. Their Bonnets or Caps are sharp on the top. They account the <HI>European</HI> Hats an easie and commodious Wear; but since none in that Countrey could learn to make them of Wooll, some have made them of Straw, and co∣ver'd them with Sear-cloth, as also with Woollen Cloth and other Stuffs; which Hats they put on over their Bonnets or Caps in rainy Weather, or else against the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their home∣ly manner of Entertain∣ment.</NOTE>By reason of the poorness of the Countrey they very seldom make any Feasts or great Enter∣tainments; yet they live plentifully, and are very free of what they have. Amongst other Dishes they boyl pounded Barley to a Dough, which they set on a woodden Peel before their Guests, who eat the same instead of Bread. They bring this first to the Table, and the Person appointed for that purpose runs with it from one Man to an∣other; which done, he gives another sort of finer Dough to the most noble Person on a Chip, the Cook serving up the other Dishes in the mean time. They never set Chairs nor Stools for their Guests, but they stand round about the Table, which serves them also both for Dishes and Tren∣chers. When they have any Spoon-meat they make a Hole in their Dough, into which they put their Broths: In stead of a Table-cloth they spread a Carpet of Leather, which is thirty Foot long, and so greasie, that the sight thereof is enough to turn a squeamish Stomach.</P>
<P>As these People spend their whole Life-time in the Field, so their greatest delight is Hunting, in which every one recreating himself, hath made a Proverb amongst them, <HI>That a Mans Happiness in this World consists in a Horse, a good Dog, and a Hawk.</HI> The Prince appoints set-times for Hunting, to which he invites all his Nobles. The time which Prince <HI>Dadian</HI> generally chose to Hunt in, was when the Deer went a Rutting, at which time going into the Thickets with his Attendants, he ambuscado'd himself, and shot the Stags as they pass'd by.</P>
<P>Amongst other Games and Pastimes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recreations.</NOTE> they use to play with a Ball on Horseback after this man∣ner: The Gamesters standing in a row, the Ball is thrown up into the Air by him that stands at the upper end, whilst others following him, endea∣vor with a Racket of four or five Foot long, to strike the Ball forward; he that catches it last, throws it to the end of the Line, and begins the Game again.</P>
<P>All trouble and charges of celebrating their Nuptials, consist in Presents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nuptials.</NOTE> which the Men are bound to give to the Brides Parents.</P>
<P>Some years since the Prince of <HI>Odisci</HI> Courted the Princess <HI>Casciach Mepe,</HI> Daughter to the Prince of <HI>Circassia,</HI> who demanded of him a hundred Slaves loaden with Cloth and Carpets, two hun∣dred Head of Cows and Oxen, and a hundred Horses.</P>
<P>When a young Man or Suitor goes to visit his Mistress, he is oblig'd to carry some Wine and an Ox with him, with which her Parents Feast and make Merry. On the Wedding Day, if the Bi∣shop or Priest be not present to Betroth them, they go into their Cellar, a place no less reve∣renc'd amongst these People than the Temples; the Priest holding two Garlands, and first setting one on the Bridegrooms Head, says, <HI>N.N. Be Crown'd the Servant of God for the Maid N. of God;</HI> the se∣cond he sets on the Brides, saying, <HI>The Maid of God N. N. be Crown'd for the Servant of God N.</HI> which done he takes a Glass of Wine, and prof∣fers the same to the Bridegroom, whil'st the Clerk holds the Garlands, and after they have drank, cuts the Thred which held their Clothes toge∣ther, and so ends the Ceremony.</P>
<P>When any of their Parents or Friends die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funerals.</NOTE> all those that dwell in the House lament with many distracted signs of sorrow; the nearest Relations pull off their Clothes, and go naked from their Middle upwards; then they divide themselves in∣to two Parties, who make Responces one to ano∣ther, often repeating the word <HI>Ohi.</HI> This time of Mourning sometimes lasts three years. The Bi∣shop also celebrates Mass for the Deceased, to his great benefit, getting many times five hundred Crowns. After Mass is finish'd they all give the Bishop a Treat, and new Habits to all the Priests which attended the Funeral: for the greatest Costs and Charges which they bestow on any thing, is on these Solemnities. They also invite the Prince or Lord of the Countrey to mourn over the Deceased, whose Dogs they place under one Pavilion, his Horses under another, and un∣der a third his Sword, as also other things which he us'd when he was living. The Prince being naked from his Middle upwards, and bare-footed, falls on his Knees under each Pavilion, where gi∣ving himself several blows on the Face, he cries, prays, and sighs: after which rising, he goes to the House of the Person which invited him, where a Feast is prepar'd for him, and also a Present.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commemo∣ration of the Dead.</NOTE>The next day after <HI>Easter-day,</HI> is the Comme∣ration of the Deceased, on which they carry Meat to the Graves, where they set a Chest strew'd on the top with Flowers, putting also a lighted Wax-Candle thereon. The Priest having Consecrated the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, they carry it to a great Tree which stands before the Temple, where each Family eat their own. This kind of making Merry they believe to be a very meritorious Act.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians are highly ap∣prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d here.</NOTE>There is no Place in the World where Physi∣ans are better receiv'd and approv'd of, and espe∣cially <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> of which when they get one, they endeavor by all means to stay him in their Countrey; and the reason of this may be, because they have none of their own, but a sort of Women, who pretend experience and knowledge in the Vertue and Preparation of some medicinal Plants and Drugs.</P>
<P>They give no other Food to their Sick but stamp'd Barley, mix'd with some Leaves of Cori∣ander, and a little Wine. In the greatest Fea∣vers they cover the Patient with Willow Leaves. They never Purge them, unless desir'd, and then give them the Juice of <HI>Tithimal</HI> or <HI>Devils-Milk.</HI> They also make use of Rhubarb, infus'd into some kind of Liquor proper against Feavers and Agues. Those that have onely Physick to provoke Seige, pass for able Physicians in this Countrey.</P>
<P>For Feavers they have learnt this Medicine from the <HI>Abcassians, viz.</HI> They put the Patient into the coldest Water that can be got in all the Countrey, and hold him a considerable time therein by two lusty Fellows; and this they ac∣count an infallible Remedy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they go to War.</NOTE>All the <HI>Mengrelians</HI> go to War, insomuch that the Prince, notwithstanding the Countrey is but small, is able in a short time to raise thirty thou∣sand Men, but commonly every House provides one Man, but all the Nobility in general are obli∣ged to follow their Prince.</P>
<P>As these People are mightily inclin'd to War∣ring, so they carry all the best things they have with them. They never make any Attempts in the Night, but spend it in Mirth and Jollity. They keep no Order or Discipline in their Bat∣tels, yet nevertheless they gain daily remarkable Conquests on the Prince of <HI>Imereti</HI> or <HI>Basciaciuk</HI>'s Subjects, and force the Prince himself to be always in a posture of Defence, sometimes driving him to the City of <HI>Cottis,</HI> and compelling his Subjects to secure themselves in the Mountains, whensoe're the <HI>Dadians</HI> make an Invasion into his Countrey. The <HI>Dadian</HI> having of late years endeavor'd to make himself Master of his Countrey, and to that purpose caus'd his Guns to be carry'd thither, but having no Persons that were able to manage a Siege, he was forc'd to desist.</P>
<P>The Women as well as the Men travel on Horseback, with a sharp Crown'd Hat made of Cloth, Lin'd with Sable Skins, and with Embroi∣der'd Coats. Ladies of Honor, according to the Custom of the Countrey, generally follow their Princess in rich Habits; Page also comes after with a Foot-stool, cover'd with Velvet, and Em∣broider'd with Silver, on which they mount and dismount their Horses. When the Court travels it is a most pleasant Sight, to behold the several troops of Ladies, all mounted on stately Steeds, follow the Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are very hospitable to Strangers.</NOTE>The <HI>Mengrelians</HI> are for the most part very civil and hospitable to Strangers, the greatest Lords ac∣counting themselves oblig'd, if a Stranger request any thing of them. When they salute any Per∣son, they kneel down on the Ground. To those that bring them good tydings they give a Spoon∣ful of Sugar, which the Prince with his own Hand puts into the Mouths of his Messengers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Go∣vement.</NOTE>The Countrey of <HI>Mengrelia</HI> is at this day Go∣vern'd by a supream Prince, who is styl'd <HI>Chesilpes Dadian; Chesilpes</HI> signifies <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Dadian</HI> is the Name of his Family: he is one of the powerfullest Princes of this Countrey, yet not deriv'd from the Kings of <HI>Georgia,</HI> but from one of his Comman∣ders or Servants, who took this part of the Domi∣nion into his possession, of which he was <HI>Eristave</HI> or Governor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Royal Seat of the Dominion.</NOTE>The ancient Kings of <HI>Georgia</HI> kept their Seat in the City <HI>Cottis,</HI> and sent Deputies into the several Provinces, to manage Affairs of State and Go∣vernment, the most eminent whereof was the <HI>Eristave</HI> of <HI>Odisci</HI> or <HI>Colchis,</HI> call'd <HI>Dadian.</HI></P>
<P>One of these Kings of <HI>Georgia,</HI> which then pos∣ses'd the whole Countrey between the <HI>Caspian</HI> and <HI>Black Sea,</HI> to Mount <HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Azerum,</HI> and Northerly to <HI>Caffa</HI> divided his Dominion amongst his Children, keeping nothing for himself but the Territories of <HI>Basciaciuk</HI> or <HI>Imereti, Odisci, Samsche,</HI> and <HI>Guriel,</HI> which also were Govern'd by his <HI>Eri∣staves.</HI> The <HI>Turk</HI> on the one side sensible of his weakness, took from him the City <HI>Teflis,</HI> eight days Journey from <HI>Azerum;</HI> and on the other side, the <HI>Persian</HI> took <HI>Taurus,</HI> and all that part of his Realm which lies between <HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Gaguete.</HI> The State thus impair'd, the <HI>Eristaves</HI> or Vice-Roys of the other Provinces found themselves to be almost as powerful as the King himself, and therefore let slip no opportunity to make them∣selves absolute Matters of the Places which they Govern'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of the first Revolt.</NOTE>Upon a Set-day, on which all the Kings De∣puties sat with him at the Table, his Cup-bearer after Dinner proffer'd him Drink, as also all the other Nobles in order, according to the Custom of the Countrey, by virtue of which all those that had the Cup presented to them, are oblig'd to make Presents to the Cup-bearer, each according to his Quality; Next after the King the Cup was presented to <HI>Dadian,</HI> who before he made his Present, ask'd <HI>Artabeg</HI> (one of those that sat near him, and accounted the most ingenious and emi∣nent Person at the Court) what Present he inten∣ded to give the Cup-bearer; whereupon <HI>Artabeg</HI> answering, <HI>A hundred Crowns,</HI> mov'd <HI>Dadian</HI> to make one far greater; which <HI>Artabeg</HI> observing, promis'd the Cup-bearer a thousand Crowns upon the delivery of the Cup to him. When <HI>Dadian</HI> saw himself thus deceiv'd, not regarding the Kings Pre∣sence, he fell upon <HI>Artabeg,</HI> and cut off his Beard; which Injury <HI>Artabeg,</HI> respecting the King's Pre∣sence, would not at that time revenge; but not long after, <HI>Dadian</HI> pursuing a Stag into the Gover∣nor <HI>Artabeg</HI>'s Dominions, his Subjects finding him separated from his Company, seiz'd on him, and brought him to their Lord, who put him into a Dungeon under Ground; in the mean while his Followers suspected that he had broke his Neck by Riding down some steep Rock, and accordingly bemoan'd his Death; but at length having re∣main'd a considerable time in Prison, <HI>Artabeg</HI> went to visit him, where amongst many other Discour∣ses, <HI>Dadian</HI> declar'd his intention that he had to make himself absolute Master of his Territory, shewing him also the easiness to accomplish it: Whereupon <HI>Artabeg</HI> promis'd him his aid and as∣sistance, telling him that he had the same De∣sign; so they both invented ways to execute their intent, and made their Subjects to acknowledge them their Kings, who before had the same Power, though derivative, under the Title of <HI>Eristaves.</HI> The King himself was forc'd, not being willing to hazard the remaining parts of his Kingdom, to acknowledge his Servants for his Companions, insomuch that his Successors entred into a League
<PB N="87" REF="77"/>with them; yet nevertheless they went to War with him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The present King of <HI>Men∣grelia.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Chesilpes</HI> or King which now Governs <HI>Men∣grelia,</HI> nam'd <HI>Levan Dadian,</HI> is the fifth of that Fa∣mily, and Son to thc King of <HI>Munacchiar,</HI> who up∣on a certain time going a Hunting, Rode with such force unawares againft another Horseman, that his Horse tumbling backwards, broke his Rider's Neck whil'st Prince <HI>Dadian</HI> was yet very young, so that one of his Uncles, nam'd <HI>George Li∣pardian,</HI> Govern'd the Realm during his Minority. This young Prince Marry'd afterwards a Daugh∣ter of the Prince of the <HI>Abcassians,</HI> of the Family of <HI>Sciarapsia,</HI> which is very much affected by this Nation. <HI>Lipardian,</HI> though very ancient, also Marry'd a young Virgin, who Name was <HI>Dareg∣gian,</HI> out of the Family of <HI>Ciladze;</HI> but this Lady delighted more in the company of <HI>Dadian,</HI> who was equal to her in years, than in her Husband <HI>Lipardians;</HI> of which <HI>Dadian</HI> taking notice, and resolving to slip no opportunity to satifie both his own and her desire, took advantage of this occa∣sion; One of his prime Nobles call'd <HI>Paponia,</HI> in∣sinuated himself into the Queens Favor, which being nois'd abroad about the Countrey, was fo ill resented by the King, that (according to the Custom of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church) he Divorc'd her, cut off her Nose, and sent her in the Head of an Army to her Father, and committed <HI>Paponia</HI> to Prison under the custody of the Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> his Nephew: After this more publickly declaring his Amours towards his Uncle's Wife, he took her out of his House, and made all his Subjects acknowledge her for <HI>Dalboda</HI> or Queen. In the interim, whil'st <HI>Dadian</HI> kept his Nuptial Feast with all the signs and testimonies of Joy, <HI>Lipar∣dian</HI> in his House perform'd all the Funeral Cere∣monies, as if his Wife had been dead, going with his whole Court into Mourning, and crying for forty Days together, according to the usual Cu∣stom, each Person also sympathizing with him; he was also visited daily by many of the Nobles, till at last being poyson'd, his Wife became absolute Queen. After this the Countrey had re∣main'd quiet a long time, had not <HI>Paponia,</HI> to re∣venge himself of <HI>Dadian,</HI> perswaded the Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> to proclaim War against him, and also contriv'd a Plot betwixt him, the <HI>Abcassians,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Basciaciuk,</HI> the design of which was to kill <HI>Dadian,</HI> and to Crown one of his Brothers, nam'd <HI>Joseph,</HI> in his stead; to which purpose they hir'd an <HI>Abcassian,</HI> who on a set-day, as <HI>Dadian</HI> was looking over a Balcony, ran him through the Back with a Lance; which done, the Assassinate immediately fled, and was never heard of after; but one of the Officers that stood by when the King received the Stab, which was not mortal, being committed to Prison, discover'd the Plot; upon which <HI>Paponia</HI> was Strangled, and his Body being cut into divers pieces, was ramm'd into a Cannon and shot into the Air; his Brother also was con∣demn'd to have his Eyes put out, and committed to perpetual Imprisonment; the Prince of <HI>Guriel</HI> was likewise taken Prisoner, and his Eyes put out, his Wife and Children taken from him, and his Territory given to the Patriarch his Uncle, call'd <HI>Malachia.</HI> Moreover, <HI>Dadian</HI> afterwards Warred against the <HI>Abcassians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dadian</HI> con∣quers the <HI>Ab∣cassians.</HI></NOTE> who during these Disturbances had made Incursions into his Domi∣nions, in revenge of the Disgrace done to his first Wife, their Prince's Daughter; but he in a short time reduc'd them, and made them pay Tribute.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dadian</HI> an ex∣cellent Ptince</NOTE>This King <HI>Dadian</HI> which now Governs this Countrey, is of such excellent Parts, that had he been bred amongst a civiliz'd People, he would undoubtedly have been one of the greatest Princes in his time: for he abhors Gluttony and Drunken∣ness, to which the Natives are much inclin'd, of∣ten dispensing with his Dinner to dispatch Busi∣ness; he is of an undaunted Courage, Prudent, Generous, and a great lover of his Subjects, whom he supports and assists on all occasions, suppressing all manner of Tyranny and Oppression: And that the <HI>Turk,</HI> his too near Neighbor, may not have an itching desire towards his Countrey, he uses this policy: When he expects Agents from <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> he sends several of his Nobles to meet them upon his Borders, and to conduct them through Mountains, Woods, and the worst Ways they, can find, and also to Lodge them in mean Huts, where they have nothing but a little Straw to lie on, and Cheese to eat: When they are admitted to Audience, he receives them sitting under a Tree on an old Carpet, in mean Clothes, with a great many Servants in pitiful Habits standing about him: After Audience they are Lodg'd in a House which will scarce keep the Weather out; where they are so ill Entertain'd, that the Agents return∣ing to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> affirm this Countrey to be the meanest in the World. 'Tis not long since he caus'd one of his Noblemens Eyes to be put out for endeavoring to extol his Subjects. He Enter∣tains both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> in his Dominions, and by that means gains a considerable Trade; he also sends for Workmen out of all the adjacent Countreys, whom he obliges to stay, by giving them Wives and Lands. He also makes daily great Presents to the Temple and Spiritual Per∣sons, and wants nothing but Architects, to build magnificent Churches.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Panish∣ment of Ma∣lefactors.</NOTE>Of all Punishments which they inflict on Ma∣lefactors, they account the bereaving them of their Sight the worst, which they do after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> They drive four Stakes into the Ground, to which they tie the Malefactor's Hands and Feet in such a manner, that he is no way able to stir; then they take two sharp Plates of Iron, about the bigness of a Shilling, made fast to two Irons which have one woodden Handle, which making red hot, they put them upon the Malefactor's Eyes, so bereaving him of his Sight with the greatest torment imaginable, which appears sufficiently by the sad effect thereof: for the whole Face and Breast swell, putting the Malefactor into such a condition, that it renders him uncapable of eating in three or four days after. They also cut off their Criminals Hands with a red hot Iron, thereby to prevent the effusion of Blood, and with a Stick take away the Marrow from the Bone, that the Flesh may not putrifie. If the Crime be small, and any one be apprehended for stealing of a Cow, he is bound to restore fifteen times the va∣lue thereof before he can be freed, of which the King receives one third part, the Court of Judi∣cature another, and the injur'd Person the rest. If the Offender be not certainly known, then they
<PB N="96" REF="78"/>lay a Cross in the bottom of a Kettle of Water, which they hang over a Fire till it boyls, and then force the suspected Person to put his naked Arm into the same, and pull out the Cross; which done, they put his Arm into a Bag, and Sealing up the same, let it remain on three days, after the expiration whereof they open it, and if no signs of scalding appear, then the accused Person is re∣leased. When the Evidence is not clear, and the Crime but small, they cause the Person whom they suspect, to swear by the Images of their Saints. They also make suspicious Persons to fight one with another after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> They run a Tilt at each other, and he that is first wounded, is punish'd as Criminal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they de∣termine Dif∣ference.</NOTE>The <HI>Mengrelians</HI> have no written Laws, yet what they follow are justly executed. In Matters which are of no great difficulty, the Prince him∣self is the Judge, and decides the fame either at his Table, when he is Hunting, or in any other place where he is when it is brought before him; but Matters of consequence are heard and deter∣min'd after this manner: The Parties concern'd chuse each of them an Arbitrator, to whom they refer the Controversie these also chuse a Solici∣tor; they often meet in the Fields under a Tree, where the Plaintiff appearing first, makes his Demand, and then gives room to the Defendant, to whom the Solicitor declares his mind; where∣upon the Defendant also with the same freedom gives his Relation; then the Plaintiff is call'd again, and the Solicitor acquaints him with the Defendant's Answer to his Demands; and if af∣ter this both Parties are silent, then the Judges pass Sentence.</P>
<P>They also maintain another Custom in their Differences, which is, never to go directly to the Person of whom they demand any thing, but al∣ways to make use of a Friend in such a Case.</P>
<P>The People formerly acknowledged the Patri∣arch of <HI>Antioch,</HI> but now him of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> yet they have two Patriarchs of their own Coun∣trey, whom they call <HI>Catholicks,</HI> the one from <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the other from <HI>odisci:</HI> He of <HI>Georgia</HI> hath under him the Provinces of <HI>Cardueli, Gaghetti, Baratralu,</HI> and <HI>Samsche;</HI> he of <HI>Odisci</HI> the Territo∣ries of <HI>Odisci, Imereti, Guriel,</HI> the <HI>Abcassians,</HI> and <HI>Suaniers.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wealth of their Pa∣triarchs.</NOTE>These Patriarchs have almost as great a Re∣venue as the Prince himself: for he continually visits his substitute Places, and in stead of ta∣king care to preserve his Flock, he fleeces them by his frequent Visits: for whenever he comes, all are oblig'd to make him great Presents; neither doth he make any Man a Bishop without a Re∣ward of five or six hundred Crowns: The Grand Visier gave him for one days Service eighty Crowns, yet he was not satisfi'd; for not long after the same Visier lying sick, sent for him, who return'd Answer, <HI>That it was not worth his while to go to him, since he gratifi'd him so ill at first;</HI> yet at last, upon promise of a more noble Reward, he went to him.</P>
<P>Every three or four years the Patriarch carries all the Money which he hath thus gotten, to the holy Sepulchre at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> verily believing, that by these Offerings he shall purchase for him∣self an entrance into Heaven.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishopricks in this Cour∣trey</NOTE>There were formerly twelve Bishopricks in this Countrey, of which there are now but six remaining, the other six being turn'd into <HI>Ab∣bacyes.</HI></P>
<P>The first Bishoprick call'd <HI>Andra,</HI> lies at the River <HI>Carax;</HI> the second, <HI>Moquis;</HI> the third, <HI>Bedias;</HI> the fourth, <HI>Kiais,</HI> so call'd from the Mountain <HI>Kiais,</HI> near which it lies; the fifth. <HI>Sca∣lingicas,</HI> hath a Cathedral, which is Dedicated to our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and is the Burying-place of the Princes of the Countrey; the sixth is <HI>Scondidi,</HI> the Church whereof is Dedicated to <HI>All Saints.</HI></P>
<P>The Bishopricks translated into <HI>Abbacyes,</HI> are <HI>Chiaggi, Gippurias, Copis</HI> and <HI>Obbugi,</HI> where formerly the Princes were bury'd, but since carry'd to <HI>Sca∣lingicas;</HI> the fifth is <HI>Sebastoli,</HI> ruin'd by the Floods; the sixth, <HI>Anarghia,</HI> was formerly call'd <HI>Heraclea.</HI></P>
<P>The Bishops are richer than any Lords of the Countrey, some of them having three or four Wives, nay more. It hapned some years since, that a Bishop being in Love with a Woman, he sold her Husband for a Slave to the <HI>Turks,</HI> that he might with the more freedom enjoy her: And not∣withstanding these Extravagancies, yet because they keep their Fasts very strictly, they account themselves better than the Prelates of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. They believe that there is no Sin, but what may be wash'd away by the Satisfaction of good Works, neither do they Pennance but very seldom; but when they find their Consciences troubled for some hainous Crime which they have committed, then they make a Present to the Church, believing that so their Sin is expi∣ated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ThePriests veyr ignorant.</NOTE>The Abbots and Priests are no whit better than the Bishops, but generally more ignorant: for the Priests are forc'd to say Mass in the <HI>Georgian</HI> Language, because they understand not so much as their <HI>A B C.</HI> This Ignorance being common amongst all their Clergy, hath made them lose the form of the Sacraments. They never Baptize their Children till they are three or four years old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they Baptize.</NOTE> when carrying them into a Cellar, which is the place where this Ceremony is perform'd, the Priest, clad in his Vestments, consecrates a great Vessel full of Water, according to the direction of the <HI>Greek</HI> Liturgy, out of which he onely reads what is written in the fame, not once offering to do what it directs or commands, which he leaves to his Clerk to perform; who then taking a little of their <HI>Mirom,</HI> or consecrated Oyl, marks the Child therewith in the Forehead with a Cross.</P>
<P>If the Church-doors be lock'd, then they say Mass in the Church-yard. Their Caps are of Wooll, and <HI>Calabashes</HI> serve them for Oyl-pots.</P>
<P>They believe to have perform'd all the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Commandments, by strictly observing the Fasts.</P>
<P>On <HI>Easter-day</HI> they do no Pennance, nor receive the Sacrament, but go two hours before day-light to Church, and so quickly return to Feasting.</P>
<P>Their greatest Festival is that of <HI>St. George,</HI> being celebrated on the twentieth of <HI>October</HI> at the Church bearing his Name;<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>George</HI>'s Feast.</NOTE> whither on the Feast-Eve the Prince after Sun-set goes, accom∣pany'd with a great Train, and sets his Seal on the Church-door, which finding untouch'd in the Morning, he again takes off, and opening the Door, discovers an Ox, which is certainly be∣liev'd by the common People to have been put in there by <HI>St. George</HI> miraculously, and presage from the motions thereof future Events, <HI>viz.</HI> If the Ox defends himself against those that endeavor to touch him, then they believe there will be Wars in the Countrey: If he be very dirty, it is a sign of a fruitful year: If he hath red Hair, great

There is also one Family amongst these People, which hath the priviledge to kill this Ox, and distribute the several parts thereof in this manner: The Head with the Horns they send to the Prince, who adorns the fame with Gold and Precious Stones; afterwards each Tribe or Family in the Countrey hath a part thereof; the rest being cut into small pieces, is divided amongst the People, who dry the same, and keep it as an infallible Re∣medy against all Distempers.</P>
<P>They strictly maintain their Fasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fasts.</NOTE> as we said before, on the three last days whereof (for they continue seven Weeks together, beginning on the <HI>Monday</HI> after <HI>Quinquagesima</HI>) they eat no Flesh.

<P>There is not a more superstitious People under the Sun than the <HI>Mengrelians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Superstions.</NOTE> which sufficiently appears by their Conceits which they hold of the Moon, accounting all their Misfortunes to pro∣ceed from thence; and therefore they abstain from all manner of Food on <HI>Mondays.</HI> He that first discovers the new Moon, gives notice thereof to his Neighbors; whereupon he that wears a Sword, draws it out, or else a Knife, wherewith they threaten it.</P>
<P>They also keep <HI>Fridays:</HI> for it is certain, that those who in the time of <HI>Constantine</HI> embrac'd <HI>Christianity,</HI> also kept that day in commemoration of the Passion of our <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>At the Birth of their Children they advise with their Priest, asking him what they must do to make them Happy? who pretending to consult with their Books, counsels them to abstain from Venison, and all things of the like nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremony at a Funeral.</NOTE>They carry not the Corps of their Dead into the Church, but onely into the Church-yards, after which they perform Divine Service in the Church, where in, stead of the Corps they set up the Spade with which they made the Grave.</P>
<P>They adorn the Front of their Churches with the Heads of Stags and wild Bears, which they account an Ornament very acceptable to God; and believe that it is of great consequence to have a good Fishing Season, if their Boats be made in a lucky time.</P>
<P>When they are out at Sea, and the Wind fails them, all that are in the, Vessel blow to fetch it again; and when the Wind is good, they permit no body to Sew any thing Aboard, or use any Needle or Thred, alledging, that the Wind with the turning backward and forward of the Needle would be at a stay.</P>
<P>They commonly impute all their Misfortunes which befall them, from the Curses of their Ene∣mies; which to prevent, some of the Nobility cause the Images of their Saints to becarry'd be∣fore them, that so they may clear the Air.</P>
<P>When they buy any thing, they always give a Present to the Seller to bless the same; neither do they ever give the thing which they sell into the Hands of the Buyer, but fetor lay it before him, being perswaded, that if they should do the contrary, all things would be lost out of their House without being able to prevent it.</P>
<P>When they wish for Rain to refresh their Corn, they take an Image of one of their Saints, and set it every day in Water till it Rains, and the first which falls they conclude to proceed from hence.</P>

The most civiliz'd are the <HI>Sovanians,</HI> who willingly desire to be in∣structed they possess a great part of the Moun∣tains towards the side of <HI>Odisci</HI> and <HI>Imereti,</HI> and serve the Prince of <HI>Imereti,</HI> Vice-Roy to the King of <HI>Dadian.</HI> They are of a large Stature, and well Limb'd, but ill Featur'd; they are valiant Sol∣diers, good Archers, and have the Art of making Guns and Powder; but yet they are so very slo∣venly, that it would be loathsom to any nice Per∣son to touch them. They have plenty of Provi∣sions, yet come every Spring to <HI>Georgia,</HI> where they enter into Service, work in the Fields, and after Harvest return, carrying away with them Copper Plates, Kettles, Iron, Linnen Cloth, Carpets, and Salt, but with Silver they will not meddle, and about the beginning of Winter carry Wood to <HI>Odisci,</HI> which is much wanting there.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of Mount <HI>Caucasus</HI> which dwell more Northerly, by the <HI>Turks</HI> call'd <HI>Abasses</HI> or <HI>Abcassians,</HI> are well proportion'd, of a good Complexion, and strong for all laborious Em∣ployments. The Countrey which they inhabit is very healthful, pleasant, and full of fruitful Hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fruitful Countrey.</NOTE> and is water'd by two Rivers, the one call'd <HI>Soutbesu</HI> and the other <HI>Subasu:</HI> There is also a brave Harbor, nam'd <HI>Eschissumeni.</HI> They possess great Herds of Cattel. They never eat Fish, though they have great quantities thereof, both in the Sea and Rivers, and utterly abhor Lobsters and
<PB N="98" REF="79"/>Crabs, mocking their Neighbors the <HI>Mengrelians</HI> for accounting them delicate Meat. They have no Corn, neither do they make use of Salt. There are an innumerable company of Hawk sand Fal∣cons, which they teach so well in eight days, that letting them flie at the Game, they return with the same upon the gingling of a Bell; and are from thence lent to <HI>Constantinople, Persia,</HI> and <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of living.</NOTE>Hunting and Hawking is their chiefest Busi∣ness and Recreation. They inhabit neither in Towns nor Castles, but fifteen or twenty Fa∣milies together, who erect Tents or Huts on the top of some pleasant Hill, which they fortifie with a kind of Pallisado's, that they may not be sud∣denly surpris'd and taken by their own Natives. Some affirm, that the Woods are their places of Residence, and that when once they setlte them∣selves in any one place, they never desert the same.</P>
<P>They endeavor to take away and sell one another for Slaves to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who highly esteem these Countrey People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Riches and Trade.</NOTE>Their Riches and Merchandise consist in all manner of Skins, Wax, Honey, and Slaves. Their Nobles commonly sell their Vassals to the <HI>Turks,</HI> in Barter for other Commodities.</P>
<P>There come yearly into the Haven of <HI>Eschissu∣muni</HI> several Ships from <HI>Lazi, Trebizonde, Constan∣tinople,</HI> and <HI>Caffa,</HI> where they stay sometimes all the Winter. The Merchants which come in them go not ashore with their Commodities, but sell them aboard, having beforehand given Oath or Hostages not to hurt one another.</P>
<P>Amongst other Customs peculiar to these Peo∣ple, one is, That they neither bury nor burn their Dead, but put the Corps into the Body of some hollow Tree, hanging up the Arms and Garments of the Deceased about it.</P>
<P>They go Cloth'd after the manner of the <HI>Cir∣cassians,</HI> onely their Hair they wear otherwise:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habit.</NOTE> They let their Mustacho's grow, but shave their Beards: On the contrary, the <HI>Papari</HI> let all their Beards grow.</P>

<P>The <HI>Circassian</HI> Horses are more esteem'd of than the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> for their extraordinary swiftness.</P>
<P><HI>John de Luca</HI> affirms, That there are no fairer People in the World than the <HI>Circassians;</HI> but we approve not thereof: for although the Men have well proportion'd Bodies, yet they are swar∣thy, and somewhat broad Fac'd; their Hair is long and black, which cutting off a Thumbs breadth from the Forehead to the Neck, they leave a small Lock on their Crown, which hangs down into their Neck. The Women are gene∣rally well shap'd, of a pleasant Countenance, and indifferently fair of Complexion; they let their Hair, which is also black, hang down intwo Braids over their Cheeks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habits of the <HI>Circas∣sians.</HI></NOTE> and go bare-fac'd. The Mens Clothes are like those of the <HI>Tagestan Tar∣tars,</HI> onely their Caps being broader, resemble those that the Jesuits wear; Their Cloaks, which are for the most part Sheep-skins, hang by a String over their Shoulders, on that side from whence the Weather comes, for they cover onely half the Body. Their Shirts being made of Cot∣ton, are Dy'd red. The Women wear black Hoods, Edg'd in stead of Lace with fine Cotton Cloth, which they tie under the Chin. The Widows wear behind on their Heads two great blown-up Bladders, cover'd with white Cotton, on each side one, which at a distance shews like three Heads. In the Summer they go onely in their Shifts, which are either colour'd red, green, yellow, or blew, and are open down to their Na∣vels; they likewise wear Amber Beads, painted Shells, Stones, Tin and Copper Plates, about their Necks, which hang down below their Breasts. The Women are very familiar, especi∣ally with Strangers, the Parents permitting their Daughters to be handled by any Person; and if Strangers be Lodg'd in their Houses, their Daugh∣ters in the Mornings visit them, arid entertain them with amorous Discourses; Virgins also go naked in the prefence of all Persons into the Ri∣vers to Bathe themselves.</P>
<P>Their chief Employment is keeping of Cattel and Husbandry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Em∣ployment.</NOTE> Those of <HI>Terki,</HI> and others near the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> maintain themselves by Fishing; and some of them Trade with Slaves, Stags, Oxen, Tyger-skins, and Wax, which they plen∣tifully find in the Woods.

<P>It is accounted ill breeding amongst the No∣bles, to have any knowledge in Arithmetick, or to drive any Trade, because a Nobleman (as they say) should never trouble himself with anything but to preserve and defend his People, Hunt, and be a good Warriour.</P>

<P>Their Marriages are nothing else but recipro∣cal Promises, made by one to another in the pre∣sence of one single Witness, without any farther Ceremony.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they or∣der their Children.</NOTE>The Women being generally Deliver'd of their Children on Beds of Straw and Chaff made

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of living.</NOTE>They live for the most part upon Sturgeon and other Fish, though sometimes they eat both tame and wild beasts: Their Bread is principally of Barley, and the usual Drink of the common People is Water; but they make a Liquor of a sort of Grain which they call <HI>Boeza,</HI> or (as <HI>John de Luca</HI> saith) they mix their Water with Honey and Barley, which letting stand ten days to soak, they afterwards boyl, whereby it becomes pleasant to the taste, and as strong as Wine. In stead of Cups or Glasses, the Vulgar use the Horns of wild Buffalo's, or other Beasts; but the Nobles drink out of Golden Cups, worth from three to five hundred Ducats; some also are of Silver, out of which they drink with great deliberation and Ce∣remony, and commonly in the Name of God, and their Saints or deceased Friends.</P>
<P>They commonly sleep with a Coat of Mayl under their Heads in stead of a Pillow, and with their Arms by them. As soon as they rise they put on the foremention'd Coat of Mayl. The Men and Women lie together, but Head to Feet, yet on one Bed, which is commonly made of Leather, and fill'd with Rushes and Rose-Leaves.</P>
<P><HI>John de Luca</HI> affirms, That the Houses are made of two rows of Poles stuck in the Ground, be∣tween which they lay plash'd Boughs, which they cover with Mortar and Straw; nor are the Prin∣ces Palaces built of better Materials, though bigger.</P>
<P>The <HI>Circassians</HI> often Engage with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> for there is not a year passes, but the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as well <HI>Mogaians</HI> as others, make Incursions into their Countrey, on purpose to get Slaves.</P>
<P>The continual Alarms in which their Enemies keep them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms.</NOTE> hath made them the best Horsemen in all these Parts. They use Arrows, which they shoot forward and backward, and wear a Sword by their Sides, and a Helmet on their Heads, which covers their Faces; they also use Lances and Ja∣velins, all which they handle with extraordinary dexterity.</P>
<P>They never make any difficulty to rob one an∣other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thievery en∣courag'd.</NOTE> which makes Stealing common here, for they never punish those which are taken in the Fact; may, ancient People, and Persons of Qua∣lity never proffer any Drink at Meals to young Folks, if they have not committed some notable Robbery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Opi∣nions in Re∣ligion.</NOTE>The <HI>Circassians</HI> are of different Opinions, for some follow <HI>Mahumetanism,</HI> others the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, but the number of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> is far the greater: for though the Priest who is at <HI>Derki</HI> Baptizes, yet he instructs them little in Matters of Religion; wherefore they daily turn <HI>Turks,</HI> and retain nothing of the Greeks, but the Custom of carrying Meat to the Graves of the Dead, and to keep some Fasts.</P>
<P>In the Countrey of <HI>Cudosci,</HI> or <HI>Holy Places,</HI> are abundance of Rams Heads, which be Relicks of the <HI>Curbans</HI> or Offerings made there.

<P>The <HI>Circassians</HI> incline much to <HI>Paganism;</HI> and though they suffer themselves to be Circumcis'd, and Believe in God, yet they have neither Scri∣pture, Priest, nor Temple, but at some set-times make their own Offerings, especiallyon <HI>Elias</HI>'s day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies at the Death of a Noble∣man.</NOTE>Upon the Decease of a Nobleman, both Men and Women coming into the Field, kill a Goat at for an Offering, and hanging his Skin Upon a Pole, having first made Merry with the Flesh, some Men stepping forth, Pray to the Skin one after another; which done, they all depart home. The Skin remains on the Pole till such time as they take it down to make room for another. Af∣ter this they raise a great Bed of Earth in the Fields, on which they lay the Corps, having first been imbowel'd; and for the space of eight days, his nearest Relations, Friends, and Vassals, come to visit him, and bring him Presents of Silver Cups, Bowes, Arrows, and other things; then they take a great Tree, hollowing the Body into the form of a Chest, into which they put the Corps with the foremention'd Presents, and so carry it in great State to the Burying-place.</P>
<P>Some of these <HI>Circassians</HI> (as <HI>Soranzo</HI> affirms) are free, others pay Tribute to the <HI>Precopenses</HI> or <HI>Crim Tartars;</HI> but as others assert, they neither acknowledge the <HI>Turks</HI> nor <HI>Tartars,</HI> but are Go∣vern'd by five prime Heads.</P>
<P><HI>George Interian</HI> attests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their De∣grees.</NOTE> that there are Nobles, Subjects, and Slaves amongst them; the Nobles being the chiefest, have many Vassals under them, whom they Govern by an arbitrary Power, allowing none to be above them but God; nei∣ther have they any Judges, nor any written Laws, but make use of their own Authority in deciding of Differences. Some affirm that they Serve the <HI>Turk, Persian,</HI> and <HI>Muscovites</HI> for Pay.</P>
<P>They have no Money in this Countrey, espe∣cially in those Places lying up into the Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Money. here.</NOTE> but value all things by <HI>Bokissins,</HI> which are pieces of Linnen or Woollen Cloth.</P>
<P>They Fight on Horseback, Arm'd with Bowes, Arrows, Swords, and Lances. There are no Fotts in all the Countrey, but onely a few old Towers, to which the People repair in time of War.

The River which comes out of the Northermost Spring, is call'd <HI>Kinsuar,</HI> as that out of the Sou∣thern, <HI>Benhora;</HI> but by their conjunction losing their former Denominations, are call'd <HI>Ganga</HI> like the other. But this River at last discharges its Waters into one of the Mouths of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> between <HI>Angely</HI> and <HI>Picholda,</HI> in about 20 Degrees of Northern Latitude. The Inhabitants also hold this Water in great veneration, by which means it is very advantageous to the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Lords of the Countrey through which it runs, because they permit no Person to wash his Face in the same without paying them a certain Sum of Money.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Bark</HI> rises from another Spring on the West side of <HI>Mount Gate,</HI> and empties it self through the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Bombain,</HI> separating the Kingdom of <HI>Zuratte</HI> or <HI>Cambaya,</HI> from that of <HI>Decan.</HI></P>
<P>The Stream <HI>Aliga</HI> likewise discharges its Wa∣ter on the West side of the same Mountain, against the middle of the Isle <HI>Anchedive,</HI> in 14 Degrees of Southern Latitude, having before separated the two Kingdoms of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Canara.</HI></P>
<P>The great River <HI>Nagundy</HI> gliding from <HI>Mount Gate,</HI> which is beyond <HI>Cananop</HI> and <HI>Calicut,</HI> runs Northerly, but within sight of the <HI>Aliga</HI> changes its course Eastward, and passes on through the Metropolis of <HI>Bisnagar</HI> and the Province of <HI>Orixa,</HI> and afterwards loses it self in the Bay of <HI>Bengala,</HI> between the sixteenth and seventeenth Degree, where the two Towns, <HI>Guadenary</HI> and <HI>Masulipatan,</HI> are built.</P>
<P>The Lake of <HI>Chiamay,</HI> lying in the North to∣wards <HI>Tartary,</HI> is the Head of six great Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lake of <HI>Chiamay.</HI></NOTE> of which three uniting one with the other, make a large Stream, which cuts through the middle of the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> as the other three fall into the Bay of <HI>Bengala.</HI></P>
<P>Many more Rivers and Lakes hath <HI>India</HI> and the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Countrey, which in our following Discourse shall be describ'd in their proper places.</P>
<PB N="106" REF="85"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Floating Bridges.</NOTE>Cross the Rivers near which any High-ways lie, are almost no other Bridges made than of Ships, by reason of the Waters in the rainy Sea∣sons, which would carry away any other that do not float.</P>
<P>In several places of <HI>India</HI> are Wells or Cisterns, on which the Inhabitants bestow great Cost, be∣ing very large and spacious, rais'd up with Free∣stone, neatly joyn'd together, and cover'd on the top with an Arch; the Water is drawn up by Oxen in little Pales or Buckets.</P>
<P>The <HI>Stagna's</HI> or Ponds, which are all artificial, of which there are very many in <HI>India,</HI> may just∣ly be accounted amongst the best of their Rarities, though they account them for things of small con∣sequence; they are made in low places, and some of them very deep and broad, and a Mile or more in circumference, and are able to furnish a popu∣lous City with Water a whole year; most of them are inclos'd within a low Stone Wall, ha∣ving several Doors, and about the inside of the Wall are many Steps leading down to the bottom, which is pav'd with Free-stone. These kind of Ponds are near populous Towns, for the accom∣modation of the People, and built for the most part at the charge of the Publick; they are fill'd with Water in the rainy Seasons, being first made clean, that so the Water may be clear; and it continues so sweet, that not onely Men and Beasts drink of it, but they also use it upon all other occasions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moun∣tains.</NOTE>As to what concerns the vast Mountains in this Countrey, the most famous are those of <HI>Balla-Gate,</HI> which begin in the North, and extend Southward to the Cape of <HI>Comory,</HI> by the Inhabitants, and also by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call'd <HI>Cory,</HI> a Tract of a hundred and twenty Leagues; they begin to raise their tops near the River <HI>Carnate,</HI> not far from the Cape and Mountain <HI>Dely,</HI> and are good Marks to those that Sail along the Coast, and lying in twelve De∣grees and a half of Northern Latitude, divide the Kingdoms of <HI>Decan, Cuncan, Canara,</HI> and <HI>Malabar,</HI> from <HI>Balla-Gate,</HI> the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> and <HI>Fish-Coast,</HI> of which particularly, and their general De∣nominations, more hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>India</HI> abounds with great and small Beasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> as Oxen, Cows, Goats, Sheep, Hogs, and all man∣ner of other Cattel, the Flesh whereof is not so well tasted as ours, by reason of the great heat of the Countrey. They seldom kill any Oxen, be∣cause they use them to work. Mutton is little esteem'd, so that all sick Persons are prohibited to eat thereof; but Pork is reckon'd very wholsom Food.</P>
<P>The Horses here are but ordinary, the best be∣ing brought thither from <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and of late from <HI>Usbeck</HI> are yearly brought twenty or thirty thousand, as also a great number through <HI>Candahor</HI> out of <HI>Persia;</HI> some also are transported hither by Sea from <HI>Ethio∣pia, Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> out of the Havens of <HI>Moca, Bassora, Bander,</HI> and <HI>Abassy.</HI></P>
<P>But here are great numbers of Buffalo's, of whose Milk the Owners make little dry and salt Cheeses, and when they do not yield that plenty, they kill and eat them.</P>
<P>Here are also many Elephants, and Rhinoce∣rots call'd <HI>Abadas,</HI> as also abundance of Apes and Bats as big as Cats, which some call <HI>Flying-Cats.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Malacca, Siam,</HI> and <HI>Bengala,</HI> are abundance of wild Goats, whose Horns are good against Poyson; the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call them <HI>Cabras de Mato,</HI> that is, <HI>Wild</HI> or <HI>Forrest-Goats.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>India</HI> likewise are great numbers of Fowls, as Pheasants, Partridges, Pigeons, Parrots, and Parraketo's of all sorts of colours. There are also Camelions, divers sorts of Serpents, and Hedghogs.</P>
<P>In <HI>Balagate</HI> are Rams without Horns, yet not∣withstanding are so strong, that a Youth may ea∣sily ride on them.</P>
<P>In many places of <HI>India</HI> up into the Countrey, breed abundance of Tygers, especiall in <HI>Bengala,</HI> near <HI>Mount Caucasus,</HI> and the Island of <HI>Iava,</HI> inso∣much that the Natives for fear of them dare not venture to gather such quantities of <HI>Gum Benzoin</HI> as they would. Some say this Beast is about the bigness of an Ass; others, that it is no bigger than a Greyhound; but <HI>Nearchus</HI> swells it to the big∣ness of a Horse, affirming to have seen the Skin of one above five Foot long; it much resem∣bles a Cat, having a thick Head, spotted Skin, glittering Eyes, sharp Teeth, Claws with Talons, and long Hair upon the Lips, which is so poisonous, that if either a Man, or the Beast it self should swallow one of them, it would certainly kill him; and the Inhabitants have observ'd, that it never goes to drink in any River, but al∣ways with its Mouth before the Stream, and ne∣ver against it, that so the Water infected by its poysonous Hair may not occasion its own death; and for the same reason it never drinks out of Lakes, Pools, or any standing Waters; and there∣fore all Persons are forbidden by the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> to keep any of the Bristles of a dead Tyger, but on pain of death must send them all to his Court, where by the King's Physician most poisonous Pills are made thereof, which are given to those whom the King condemns to die at his pleasure.</P>
<P>The Tygre exceeds all Beasts in ravening, for he is said to be the most voracious and fiercest Creature in <HI>Bengala,</HI> and that he will follow a Ship from which he receives the least injury, a∣bove thirty Leagues along the Shore, and there∣fore the Inhabitants are greatly afraid of him, and call him by several Names.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> saith the Tyger is a Beast of wonderful swiftness; which <HI>Bontius</HI> contradicts, affirming that he is very flow, and therefore lurks, or ra∣ther watches for Man-kind, who are not so swift as Stags, wild Swine, and other Beasts, which may easily escape from him by flight; wherefore he never catches any Beast, except it be by surprize, lying sculking in a Hedge or Thicket, from whence he leaps suddenly upon them; and if he chance to miss his prey, then he returns growling back, and runs into the Wood, to see what he can find there; he generally strikes his Tallons into the Necks of those Beasts he seizes, and beats the strongest down with one stroke, and having first suck'd out the Blood, drags the re∣maining part into the Wood to satisfie his Hunger with the Flesh by Meals. He keeps generally in the Woods, water'd by Rivers, that when other Beasts come to drink, he may surprise and prey upon them.</P>
<P>There are likewise Jackalls, in the <HI>Greek</HI> call'd <HI>Hyena,</HI> Camelions, and Lizzards, besides vast numbers of Ravens, which flying into the Houses, if the Windows be open, carry away the Meat from the Table.</P>
<P>The Rats of this Countrey are as big as suck∣ing Pigs, which do much mischief to the Houses, by undermining the Foundations, and eating through the Walls. Another fort of Rats, which are lesser, and have red Hair smelling like Musk,
<PB N="107" REF="85"/>also molest this Countrey, and therefore the In∣habitants set their Chests and Cupboards on four Pillars a good distance from the Wall, placing Tubs with Water underneath; for else they would immediately swarm with the said Insects. Besides these, there are other Pismires, which be∣ing a Finger long, do great mischief to Plants.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Coun∣trey stor'd with Plants.</NOTE>This Countrey is stor'd with all manner of Plants; and though there grows little Wheat, yet it abounds with Rice and Barley, as also <HI>Maiz,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and abundance of Shell∣fruit. There are few or no Apples, Pears, Cher∣ries, Plums, Peaches, and fewer Grapes, except in <HI>China:</HI> But in stead of them, there are many other Trees, Plants, and Fruits, unknown in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> The chiefest of the Trees is the <HI>Coco</HI>-tree, which bears <HI>Coco</HI>-nuts, and affords many other Commodities.</P>
<P>The other Plants, Fruits, and Drugs are <HI>Banana's</HI> or <HI>Pisang, Anana's, Jaca, Mangas, Kaions, Jambes, Jambolins, Jangomas, Carambolas, Brindoins, Durions, Papaios, Inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes, Areka, Betel, Cubebs, Tamarind, My∣robalanes, Ambare, Caranda's, Mangostans,</HI> Pepper, Ginger, Cloves, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, <HI>Cardamom, Galanga, Cost, Spikenard, Aloes, Camphir, Calam∣bak, Sandal-wood, Benzoin, Amphion</HI> or <HI>Opium, In∣dico, Ambergreece, Musk, Civet, Assafoetida, China Roots, Great Canes,</HI> and many other Plants and Fruit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chewing of <HI>Betel</HI> very common, with its Descripti∣on.</NOTE>The chewing of <HI>Betel</HI> with <HI>Areca</HI> and Chalk is very common through <HI>India,</HI> and therefore ought to be briefly described. The <HI>Betel,</HI> or <HI>Betre,</HI> is by the <HI>Arabians,</HI> as <HI>Avicenna</HI> testifies, call'd <HI>Tembur,</HI> or <HI>Tambul;</HI> by the <HI>Turks, Japrach Industani;</HI> by those of <HI>Decan, Zuratte,</HI> and <HI>Canaria, Pan.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Betel</HI> runs up by Poles like our Hops, and also on the Bodies of Trees: Some, to their greater advantage, permit them to grow up by the Pepper or <HI>Areca</HI> Trees. They constantly wa∣ter their <HI>Betel,</HI> the Leaves whereof are like those of the Lemmon-trees, but a little bigger, longer, and sharper at the end.</P>
<P>This Plant, according to <HI>Garcias,</HI> resembles that of the Pepper so exactly in Twigs, Leaves, and manner of growth, that one who doth not very well know it cannot distinguish them. The <HI>Be∣tel</HI> also produces a Fruit like that of the White and Long Pepper, or rather like a Rats Tail, which the <HI>Malayans</HI> call <HI>Syriboa,</HI> and is for its strange shape in greater esteem than the <HI>Betel</HI> Leaf it self.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption and Use of <HI>Areka.</HI></NOTE>The Fruit <HI>Areca,</HI> or <HI>Arecka,</HI> so called in general by the <HI>Indians,</HI> and by the <HI>Portugues,</HI> with a cor∣rupted Name, <HI>Arequero,</HI> is in <HI>Zurratte</HI> and <HI>Decan</HI> call'd <HI>Suppary;</HI> on the Island of <HI>Zeilan, Paoz;</HI> in <HI>Malacka,</HI> by the <HI>Javans, Pinang;</HI> in <HI>Cotzyn, Cha∣cany;</HI> by the <HI>Arabians, Fausel;</HI> and by <HI>Avicenna, Filfel</HI> and <HI>Fufel;</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> by the Vulgar, <HI>Pak;</HI> but by the Nobles, <HI>Areca. Varto∣man</HI> calls the Tree <HI>Areca,</HI> and the Fruit <HI>Coffol.</HI></P>
<P>The Tree it self on which this Fruit grows shoots up with a straight Body, having so smooth a Bark, that none can climb up without some help. The Boughs shoot not downwards, but upwards, and also turn up at the ends, and there∣fore at some distance seem Globular. The Leaves thereof grow like the Teeth of a Comb, one by another. The Fruit grows on the undermost Boughs, ten or twelve of them in a Cluster, at a thick long Stalk, and being cover'd with a rough yellow Shell, is about the bigness of a Nut∣meg, or small Acorn; and before it grows hard, it is like a Date, full of pale red Veins, and flat at one end: Yet nevertheless there are three se∣veral sorts of it; the first is flat on one side, and on the other broader and bigger; the second be∣ing less, blacker, and harder, is by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Checanum,</HI> and grows for the most part in <HI>Cotzyn:</HI> It draws the Rheum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Vertues.</NOTE> and makes the Mouth look of a reddish black colour, like the Mulberry. The third sort makes a man giddy, and intoxicates the Brain; though this quality is ascrib'd only to the unripe Fruit, There is also a white sort, which grows in great abundance in <HI>Zeilan.</HI> Out of the great Fruit, by the power of Fire and Glass Instruments, the Inhabitants distil a Water, which is a most excellent Medi∣cine against a Flux. The Fruit grows very plen∣tifully in <HI>Malabar,</HI> on the Island <HI>Zeilon,</HI> and also in <HI>Zurratte, Decan,</HI> and <HI>Malacka;</HI> but the best of all, on the Island <HI>Mombain,</HI> and in <HI>Basaim.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they use it.</NOTE>The <HI>Indians</HI> break this Fruit into four pieces, if it be pretty big, or else into two; and roul them up in a <HI>Betel</HI> Leaf, with a little Ashes, or Chalk of burnt Oyster-shells: for the <HI>Betel</HI> being chew'd alone is bitter; therefore, to take away that bitterness, they mix the same with <HI>Areka</HI> and a little Chalk, and esteem the same, thus pre∣par'd, of a pleasant taste. Some also put a Juyce call'd <HI>Cate</HI> amongst it, which with them is an ex∣cellent Remedy against sore Gums.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Juyce of <HI>Cate</HI> how made.</NOTE>The Juyce <HI>Cate</HI> is extracted out of a Tree about the bigness of an Ash, with Leaves like those of the <HI>Tamarisk,</HI> having many Thorns, and said to blossom, but bearing no Fruit. The Wood is ve∣ry strong, hard, close, and heavy, and not subject to rot, whether it stands in the Air or Water; wherefore the Inhabitants call it <HI>Hacchie,</HI> that is, <HI>Semper vivens;</HI> of which, by reason of its hard∣ness, they make great Pestles to stamp their Rice in Wooden Mortars, six Foot in circumfe∣rence.</P>
<P>This Tree grows for the most part in <HI>Cambaya,</HI> especially in and about the Towns <HI>Bacaim, Manora,</HI> and <HI>Daman,</HI> as also on the Main Land of <HI>Goa,</HI> and in many other Places, though not in such abun∣dance as in those foremention'd, from whence the Juyce <HI>Cate</HI> is carried in great quantities to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Malacka,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carri'd much to <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> (because it is much used there with <HI>Betel:</HI>) but to <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> in lesser quantities, as a Drug.</P>
<P>The manner of extracting this Juyce is thus: The Boughs of the Tree being cut small, are de∣cocted in Water, then stamped, and made up into Cakes with the Meal of <HI>Nachoani</HI> (which is a small black Seed, of taste like Rye, and good to make Bread) and the Saw-dust of a kind of black Wood, which are dried in the Shade, that the Sun may not attract their Vertue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Very Physi∣cal.</NOTE>It is an excellent Remedy not onely to preserve the Gums, and fasten the Teeth; but also to stop a Flux, and to cure sore Eyes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thought to be the <HI>Lucium</HI> of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI></NOTE><HI>Garcias</HI> will have this to be the <HI>Lucium</HI> of the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> for the manner of ex∣tracting it is by all described to be the same with theirs, and judg'd to have one and the same ope∣ration with the <HI>Cate.</HI></P>
<P>This Juyce hath received the Name <HI>Cate</HI> from the <HI>Arabians, Persians,</HI> and other People of <HI>Asia,</HI> because the greatest quantity thereof is used in <HI>Malacka,</HI> where it bears the same denomination, except that the last Letter E changed into O, makes it <HI>Cato.</HI></P>
<P>Noble-men mix their <HI>Betel</HI> with <HI>Burnean</HI> Cam∣phir,
<PB N="108" REF="86"/><HI>Calamback</HI> or Aloe-wood, Musk, and Am∣bergreece.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The general use of <HI>Betel.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Betel</HI> being thus prepared, is of an extra∣ordinary pleasant taste, and by its being perfum'd causes a sweet Breath, and for that reason is con∣stantly chew'd by the Inhabitants, as also others, according to their Estates and Quality; though some chew their <HI>Areka</HI> with Cloves and Carda∣mom.</P>
<P>The Kings and Princes use also Pills of beaten <HI>Areka, Cate,</HI> Camphir, and Aloe-wood, which they chew with <HI>Betel</HI> in stead of <HI>Areka.</HI></P>
<P>When they, use their <HI>Betel,</HI> they first nip out the Veins in the Leaves; then they roul up the Ashes of burnt Oyster-shells and the bruis'd <HI>Areka</HI> in a <HI>Betel</HI> Leaf, which they put into their Mouthes and chew. The first Moisture, being red like Blood, they spit out, that its acrimony may not prejudice their Mouthes; the rest they swallow: and some which account it an excellent Medicine for the clensing of the Brain, swallow the first also. The redness of the Moisture is occasion'd by the Ashes, the Juyce of the <HI>Betel</HI> being of it self green. It also makes the Lips and Teeth red, and black if too much used, which the <HI>Indians</HI> extol as much as we white Teeth.</P>
<P>The Kings themselves present these Leaves by their Servants to their Nobles and others. Those who go to travel have Silk Bags full of <HI>Betel</HI> gi∣ven them: Neither doth any Friend go from the other without a Present of <HI>Betel,</HI> that being a Farewel-Gift.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Brindones,</HI> a Fruit.</NOTE>In several Parts of <HI>India</HI> grows a certain Fruit call'd <HI>Brindones;</HI> and by <HI>Linschot, Brindoins;</HI> which is a little reddish on the outside, but blood-red within, and of a very sowre taste: yet many People are much pleased with it; and the Dyers make great use of it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ambare</HI> Tree.</NOTE>The <HI>Ambare</HI> is a large thick Tree, with Leaves like those of the Walnut, of a pale green, and interlac'd with many Veins. The Flowers are small and white; the Fruit about the bigness of a Walnut, with a smoother Shell, of a strong scent, and a firm and well-rellish'd Pulp.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canarians</HI> call this Tree <HI>Ambare;</HI> the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> the Fruit <HI>Ambares;</HI> the <HI>Persians, Ambereth;</HI> the <HI>Turks, Aarab:</HI> And all use the Juyce thereof among their Meat instead of Verjuyce. The ripe Fruit being also eaten with Salt and Vinegar cau∣seth an appetite. The <HI>Indians</HI> look upon the same as an excellent Medicine against the Rising of the Gall. The Fruit being pickled up in Salt and Vinegar, keeps good a long time. <HI>Texeira</HI> tells us, that this Tree loses its Leaves so soon as any Water falls on the same, and that the like of it is not in all <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Amba</HI> Tree.</NOTE>Another Fruit-tree by the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> call'd <HI>Amba;</HI> in <HI>Canaria, Ambo;</HI> and by others, <HI>Mangas,</HI> grows also in several parts of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>It is a large spreading Tree, like our Oaks, ha∣ving many great and crooked Boughs. The Blos∣soms or Flowers are yellow, growing in clusters; and the Fruit is for the most part bigger than a Goose Egg.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Fruit Me∣dicinal.</NOTE>The <HI>Mangas,</HI> or <HI>Amba,</HI> is the best Fruit that grows in <HI>India,</HI> the same Tree producing Fruit different in Colours; for some are of a pale green, others yellow, and a third reddish, which are of a very pleasing smell, but of a bitter taste, and is accounted a good Medicine against the Worms.</P>
<P>The green Fruit is very sowre, and if eaten raw hurts the Teeth; wherefore many make a Pap thereof, which mix'd with Sugar tastes like scalded Goosberries: And thus prepar'd, it forti∣fies the Stomach, cools the Inflammation of the Blood, Liver, and Reins.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The immo∣derate use of it breeds the Flux.</NOTE>The ripe Fruit not onely changes its green co∣lour into yellow, but also loses its cooling quality, becoming sweeter, and more moist wherefore if any eat thereof immoderately, he is certain to have the Bloody Flux.</P>
<P><HI>Acosta</HI> tells us, That this Fruit is sometimes cut into Slices, steep'd in Wines, and so eaten. It is also preserv'd with Sugar, that so it may keep the longer; and sometimes opened in the middle with a Knife, and stuff'd full of Ginger, Garlick, Mustard-seed, Salt, Oyl, and Vinegar.</P>
<P>Before this Fruit is fully ripe it hangs from <HI>April</HI> till <HI>November</HI> upon the Tree, according to the nature of the Soil, and situation of the Place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Caran∣das.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Carandas</HI> is a Tree about the bigness of a Crab-tree, hath the same sort of Leaves, and abundance of Blossoms, The Fruit also resem∣bles a Crab, which, ripe, some eat with Salt; but generally they pickle them green in Salt and Vinegar, and eat them to provoke an Appetite.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nimbo,</HI> a Physical Tree, and its Ver∣tues.</NOTE>Another Tree, highly extoll'd for its Physical Vertue, though very scarce, is call'd <HI>Nimbo;</HI> and by those of <HI>Malabar, Bepole.</HI> It grows to the big∣ness of an Ash, and at a distanee seems very like it. The Boughs are full of Leaves, and white Cinque-foil'd Flowers, with yellow Stalks smelling like Thyme. The Fruit is like an Olive, cover'd with a thin Shell, and grows at the ends or extremities of the Boughs. This Tree is much used in Physick. The Leaves are very excellent; for being bruis'd, and dipp'd in Lemmon Juyce, and laid on Ulcerated Wounds, as well of Men as Beasts, they suddenly heal the same, because they first draw out all the Purulent Matter, mundisie the Flesh, and make the Skin to grow. The Juyce of the Leaves is very good, taken either alone, or with Wine, Water, or Broth, or applied outwardly upon the Navel, with a little Ox-gall, Vinegar, or Aloes, to kill and de∣stroy all sorts of Worms; and therefore the In∣habitants of this Countrey, especially those of <HI>Malabar,</HI> much use it. The Flowers and Fruits also do them great kindness, in curing of Aches, Pains, Ulcers, Swellings, and Weakness of the Limbs. Out of the Fruit they extract an Oyl exceeding good against the shrinking of, or pains in, the Sinews, if used warm, and applied by the <HI>Malabars</HI> to cure Wounds, Stitches, and other Di∣stempers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Nigun∣da,</HI> another Physical Tree.</NOTE>Two other Trees grow in many Places of <HI>In∣dia,</HI> especially in the Province of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and are found to be excellent Remedies against divers Distempers. The first is accounted the Male, and by the <HI>Canarians</HI> call'd <HI>Varalo Nigunda.</HI> It is about the bigness of an Almond Tree, with Leaves green at the top, and woolly underneath, with notches round about the edge.</P>
<P>The other, being the Femal, is by the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> call'd <HI>Negundo,</HI> or <HI>Norchila;</HI> in <HI>Malabar, Noche;</HI> in <HI>Balagate, Sambali;</HI> and commonly in <HI>Canaria, Nyergundi:</HI> But the <HI>Arabians, Persians,</HI> and the In∣habitants of <HI>Decan,</HI> call both the Male and Female <HI>Bache;</HI> and the <HI>Turks, Ayt.</HI></P>
<P>They both grow to about the same height; or, as <HI>Garcias</HI> affirms, to the height of a Peach-tree: but have broader and rounder Leaves, much re∣sembling those of the white Poplar.</P>
<PB N="109" REF="86"/>
<P>The Leaves of both are in taste sharp, and bitter on the Tongue. Underneath most of Leaves in the Morning lies a kind of white or Froth, which distils out of them in the Night. The Blossoms of both are of a whitish Ash-colour, resembling that of the Rosmary; and the Fruit also of both is like black Pepper.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Vertues.</NOTE>This Tree is very serviceable in the Countreys where it grows, to all Diseased People; and therefore would long ere this have been extin∣guish'd, or at least been raised to a great value, if the cut-off Sprigs did not grow again: But the more the Boughs are cut, the better the Tree thrives. The Leaves and Flowers being bruis'd together, and boyl'd in Water, or fry'd in Oyl, are with great success applied to all Sores whatso∣ever, and have wonderful Operations on Bruises, Sprains, and Aches.</P>
<P>The Women wash and bathe their Bodies at all times with the Water wherein the Leaves of this Tree are boyl'd; nay, they believe that the Juyce of the Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit cause Conception. The <HI>Daya's</HI> or Ladies also make use of this Tree.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jambolins,</HI> a wholesom Fruit.</NOTE>In the Fields of <HI>India</HI> grows a wild Plant, shap'd like a Myrtle Tree, but with Leaves like those of a Crab-tree, or, as <HI>Paludanus</HI> saith, of a Haw∣thorn, which bears a Fruit exceedingly resem∣bling a great Olive, but of a very sharp taste, by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Jambolins,</HI> which are pickled up like Olives. The Bark of this Tree is almost like that of the Mastick, and, according to <HI>Acosta,</HI> is not used in Physick, but boyl'd and eaten with Rice, because it creates a good Appetite.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jangomas,</HI> what it is like</NOTE>The <HI>Jangomas</HI> is a Fruit in colour like Rasber∣ries, but in taste like a green Plum, growing upon a large and prickly Tree.

<P>The best way (as <HI>Garcias</HI> hath it out of the Mouthes of credible Persons) of Planting this Tree is, to sow the Seeds with the Dung of a certain Bird who feeds on the Fruit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Vertue.</NOTE><HI>Jacob Bont</HI> affirms, That this Tree is very like the Sloe-tree; wherefore the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in <HI>Java</HI> call the <HI>Jangomas, Javan-Sloes,</HI> or <HI>Little Plums.</HI> When ripe, they turn yellow; and the Juyce of these, like that of ours, mix'd with the Water of <HI>Champacka</HI> and Roses, cures the Heat in the Throat, and is an infallible Medicine against the Bloody-flux, Loosness, and Gripings.</P>
<P><HI>Prosper Alpinus,</HI> in his Book of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Plants, calls this Tree <HI>Paliurus,</HI> out of whose Fruit is made a Syrrup, which is no less famous than was the Juyce of <HI>Acacia</HI> amongst the An∣cients.</P>
<P>Amongst the cheifest and most delicious Fruits of all <HI>India,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mangostans.</NOTE> is that call'd <HI>Mangostans,</HI> which, as <HI>Garcias</HI> tells us, is as big as an Orange, having an Ash-colour'd Skin, and a Pulp like an Orange, but not sticking to the Shell.</P>
<P>This Fruit grows on a small Tree, like an ordi∣nary Apple-tree, but having Leaves like Laurel, and yellow Flowers.</P>
<P>The Fruit in the Shell represents exactly the Granate, and hath the same taste, onely a little bitterer. At the bottom about the Stalk it is co∣ver'd with three or four little Leaves, like a Rose; but hath a Crown on the top, the number of whose spiry points agree exactly with the Kernels within.</P>
<P>The Fruit which the <HI>Malabars</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Corambola's,</HI> is in <HI>Decan</HI> nam'd <HI>Camariz;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Corambola's,</HI> their Description.</NOTE> in <HI>Canara, Camarix</HI> and <HI>Carabeli;</HI> in <HI>Malaya, Bolimba</HI> or <HI>Balimba;</HI> by the <HI>Persians, Chamoroch;</HI> and by <HI>Linschot, Bolunbak.</HI> This Fruit is about the bigness of a small Hens Egg, separated into four parts, of a yellowish colour, and grows on a Tree about the bigness of a Quince-tree. The Blossoms thereof consist in five reddish-colour'd Leaves, and like those of a Caper, small, and of no pleasing smell; but fair to the Eye, and in taste like Sorrel.</P>
<P>This Fruit, as <HI>Bontius</HI> affirms, lies in an oval Cod, divided by thin Skins into four parts, which in∣close the Seed. The green Fruit is sowre and at∣tracting; but the ripe is not of that quality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Use and Vertues.</NOTE>They commonly pickle them in Vinegar (as many other <HI>Indian</HI> Fruits) with Garlick, Onions, Green Ginger, and Pepper, and serve them to the Table in stead of Capers, Olives, and other Sawces, to create a Stomach. Of the Juyce thereof they make a Syrrup, very good against the Bloody-flux, Gripings, Cramp, Burning Fe∣vers, and all other Distempers proceeding from the Gall; to which purpose the Inhabitants of the Island <HI>Java</HI> preserve the same. Moreover this Syrrup, being mix'd with Honey, is taken for sore Throats.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canarians</HI> make of its Juyce, and other In∣land Medicines, an excellent Water against Dim∣ness, and other Distempers incident to the Eyes.</P>
<P>Their Midwives, which they call <HI>Dayas,</HI> use also the dry'd beaten Fruit, by mixing <HI>Betel</HI> amongst the same, to force away the Secundine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Preci∣ous Stones found here.</NOTE>Between the Island <HI>Zeilan</HI> and the Cape of <HI>Co∣mori,</HI> near the Island <HI>Manar,</HI> the Natives Fish for Pearl.

<P>The Seasons in <HI>India</HI> are much differing from ours, and one Coast from another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Rain in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE>In <HI>Suratte,</HI> and through all <HI>India,</HI> there falls lit∣tle or no Rain, excepting at the Season in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Pausecal,</HI> which lasting about three Months, begins in <HI>June:</HI> and by rea∣son of these constant Rains, some name these three Months Winter: Notwithstanding, at this time, as well in <HI>India,</HI> as in other Countreys lying in 23 Degrees from the Equinoctial Line, they feel the greatest and powerfullest Heat.</P>
<P>On all the Coasts of <HI>India</HI> the Rainy Seasons begin not at one time's; for it begins first in the Southern Countrey from the Cape <HI>Comoryn,</HI> and runs from thence to the Northern Parts; where∣fore it begins later in <HI>Cambaya,</HI> and other Northerly Places, than at <HI>Goa,</HI> where it appears on the ele∣venth of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore the farther the Places lie to the Northward, the longer it is before the Rainy Sea∣son comes thither: And for the same reason the <HI>Persians,</HI> in their Table-books and Almanacks, set the down the Rainy Seasons to begin in <HI>India</HI> on the fifteenth of their third Month, which they call <HI>Cordad,</HI> and, according to our Account of Time, falls out on the twenty third of <HI>May:</HI> For these Almanacks are made suitable to the Latitude of the Northern Countreys, as to <HI>Cambaya, Surat,</HI> and many other Places where the <HI>Portuguese</HI> drive the greatest Trade.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin∣ning of their Winter and Summer.</NOTE>From the Kingdom of <HI>Cambaya,</HI> which is the first Westward to the Cape of <HI>Comoryn,</HI> along the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> Winter begins about the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> and continues till <HI>August;</HI> and at the same time from this Cape to the Coast of <HI>Corman∣del</HI> it is Summer, and the contrary in the follow∣ing Moneths, when it is Summer every where else, for from <HI>August</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> so long as it is Winter in the Eastern parts of <HI>India,</HI> or on the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> the Inhabitants Westward on the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> enjoy plenty of Summer Weather, whenas both these Places lie under one Climate, and in one Latitude.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Benefit of the great Rains.</NOTE>Many years since it hath been found by expe∣rience, that this Rain having continu'd some days in <HI>India,</HI> and ceasing, and fair Weather following for many Weeks after, it begins to Rain with greater violence than before; and therefore without doubt this Rain is the onely work of Di∣vine Providence, because <HI>India</HI> without these great Rains would not be inhabitable in those times, by reason of the exceeding Heat and Drought, which is made temperate by the Rain, which also moi∣stens the Ground, being before parch'd and burnt, and not onely makes these Countreys habitable, but also fruitful, causing the Ground to produce all things in a plentiful manner, whil'st the Air grows much sweeter and pleasanter, and much healthier for all Persons.</P>
<P>There is also this difference in respect of the se∣veral remote Countreys, <HI>viz.</HI> the Rain being sooner, and much more in one place than the other; as in <HI>Bagnola,</HI> and along the Coast of <HI>Cor∣mandel,</HI> to the Island <HI>Ceilon,</HI> it begins and ends a Moneth sooner than on the Coast of <HI>Malabar.</HI> In <HI>Bagnola</HI> the rainy Season continues four Moneths, and sometimes it Rains eight days and Nights without ceasing; whenas in <HI>Doly</HI> and <HI>Agra</HI> it is nothing near so vehement, nor of that continu∣ance, three or four days passing together without a drop of Rain, and commonly from Sun-rise till nine or ten a clock it Rains very little or not at all. But the most remarkable difference is, that the Rain which falls in these several places comes out of divers parts of the World, as towards the City of <HI>Dely</HI> it comes out of the East, in which <HI>Bengala</HI> lies, whenas there, and on the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> it comes out of the South, and on the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> always out of the West. Accor∣ding as the Summer Heats come earlier or later, or are hotter or milder, so the rainy Season comes also sooner or later, falls in more or less abun∣dance, and continues longer or shorter. It seldom Rains at <HI>Dely</HI> till after several days abundance of Clouds are driven Westward.</P>
<P>Lastly, this rainy or tempestuous Season is com∣monly by a corrupt <HI>Arabick</HI> word call'd <HI>Mauzon Mausem.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anciently five thousand great Cities in <HI>India.</HI></NOTE>Ancient Geographers relate, that in former Ages five thousand great Cities flourish'd in <HI>India,</HI> the best of which was <HI>Nysa,</HI> in which (as the Natives affirm) Father <HI>Liber</HI> or <HI>Bacchus</HI> was born; and to this day all the Towns and Cities in <HI>India</HI> are very large and populous, which is no wonder, considering the <HI>Indians,</HI> an ancient People, never went out of their native Countrey.</P>
<P><HI>Bacchus</HI> was the first that marching with his Army into <HI>India,</HI> subdu'd them, after which the <HI>Persians</HI> vanquish'd and possess'd the Countrey ly∣ing between the <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges,</HI> till <HI>Alexander</HI> having vanquish'd <HI>Darius,</HI> defeated <HI>Porus</HI> King of <HI>India;</HI> after this it enjoy'd the happiness of a luxuriant Peace, every one under his peculiar King, till they were invaded by the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> the first whereof was <HI>Vasques de Gama,</HI> who setting Sail <HI>Anno</HI> 1497 from <HI>Spain,</HI> discover'd the Sea-Coasts from <HI>India;</HI> after which others of the same Nation; and lastly, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> a∣bout the latter end of the last Age, have made farther Inspections into these Countreys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their gene∣ral Name.</NOTE>All the Inhabitants of <HI>India</HI> are by a general Name call'd <HI>Indig</HI> or <HI>Indians,</HI> though they have several other Titles given them, according to their several Qualities, or the divers Countreys where∣in they reside.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Indians</HI> along the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Division.</NOTE> and other Countreys thereabouts, are divided in∣to four Tribes, <HI>viz.</HI> those of the <HI>Brahmanes, Set∣trea's, Weinsja's</HI> or <HI>Benjans,</HI> and <HI>Soutra's;</HI> others add a fifth, but themselves think it not worthy to be reckon'd amongst them.</P>
<P><HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> anciently divided these People into seven Tribes, who all follow'd several Employments or Studies; and amongst these the first were the Philosophers, which with∣out doubt were the <HI>Brahmans</HI> or <HI>Brahmines,</HI> con∣cerning whom they say, that as amongst Beasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> highly esteem'd.</NOTE> the Cows, amongst Birds, the <HI>Gorouda,</HI> (which is a red Sparrow with a white Circle about the Neck) amongst Trees, the <HI>Rawasistow</HI> is the most esteem∣ed, so likewise amongst Men, the <HI>Brahmans</HI> are best belov'd of God, and therefore are highly re∣verenc'd and honor'd by their own Natives. The <HI>Vedam</HI> or Law-Book hath not a little added to the Honor of this Tribe: for by that Law no <HI>Brah∣man</HI> can be put to death, let his Crime be never so hainous; but if for some capital Offence he hath deserv'd to die, they onely put out his Eyes: for they account it one of the five deadly Sins that cannot be pardon'd, to put a <HI>Brahman</HI> to death; wherefore whoever kills a <HI>Brahman,</HI> must, accord∣ing to the Order of the <HI>Vedam,</HI> go in Pilgrimage twelve years, and beg Alms with the deceased <HI>Brahmans</HI> Scull, out of which he must eat and drink whatsoever is given him, and after expira∣tion of that time be bountiful in giving Alms, and build a Temple in honor of <HI>Eswara.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Settrea's</HI></NOTE>The second Tribe in order is that of the <HI>Set∣trea's,</HI> consisting in the Nobility of the Countrey, who are call'd <HI>Raies</HI> or <HI>Ragias,</HI> and are (as we say) <HI>Comites Regis,</HI> the King's Companions or Cousins, who therefore writes in his Letters, <HI>Raja of Raja's.</HI> In ancient times this Tribe had onely two Branches, the one call'd <HI>Souriwansjam,</HI> and the other <HI>Somowansjam; Souri</HI> signifies in the Coun∣trey Idiome, <HI>Samscortam,</HI> or the <HI>Sun;</HI> and <HI>Somo,</HI> the <HI>Moon.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these two, there are at this day many other, though of less Dignity, because they de∣graded their Pedigree, by mixing with other in∣ferior Tribes; wherefore those of the two Bran∣ches will not contract any Marriuges or affinity with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Noble∣mens duty.</NOTE>The Office of these Noblemen is to defend the Countrey, oppose their Enemies, take care for the maintenance of the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> see that the Laws be not violated, and in short, to inspect the Government of the whole Realm.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Weinsja's</HI></NOTE>The third Tribe is that of the <HI>Weinsja's,</HI> and comprehends some which are call'd <HI>Comiteia's,</HI> and others <HI>Setti Weapari.</HI> They maintain themselves by Merchandizing and <HI>Broakage,</HI> which Office they are bound to perform with great fidelity, and be contented with a reasonable Gain. Most of
<PB N="111" REF="87"/>them live after the manner of the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> and like them, never eat any thing which hath life, when as those of the second and fourth Tribe eat Fish and Flesh, Beef onely excepted, which in the <HI>Vedam</HI> or Law-Book is generally forbidden to all the Tribes.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Soudra's</HI></NOTE>The fourth Tribe is that of the <HI>Soudra's,</HI> and consists of the vulgar or common sort of People, but most especially of Tradesmen and Artificers, This Tribe is also divided into many several Branches, distinguish'd by peculiar Names.

From these Marriages this Family sprang; into which are receiv'd all such as have lost their Pedigree, and therefore they compare it to the Sea, which receives the Wa∣ters of all Rivers, and yet never becomes full. Some of this Family are Governors, but the most are such as Paint on Cotton, which is partly us'd for Clothing in their own, and partly transported to foreign Countreys.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sitties</HI> are Chapmen or Pedlars, and some of them wanting Estates to Trade, perform the Offices of Porters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Paly</HI> are either Drovers, who sell Cattel, Husbandmen, Painters, or Soldiers, and were an∣ciently accounted a valiant People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cottewaneni, Sitties,</HI> and <HI>Illewanies,</HI> Trade in all manner of Fruit and <HI>Jagara</HI> or brown Su∣gar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caiclle</HI> are a despicable People, most of the Women being Strumpets, which they account no disgrace.</P>
<P>The <HI>Catalja's</HI> are Smiths working both in Gold and Iron, Masons, Carpenters, and Bricklayers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carreans, Patnouwa's, Maccova's,</HI> and <HI>Calli∣a's,</HI> are Fishermen; the first and third Fish with great Nets, the second with small ones, and the last after a different manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conapule</HI> are Scriveners; the <HI>Gurrea's</HI> and <HI>Bargurrea's,</HI> Herdsmen; and the <HI>Berga's,</HI> though the last are accounted a noble Family.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kiddi</HI> are generally Husbandmen, but some of them Soldiers; the <HI>Camawaers</HI> are also Farmers; the <HI>Inmadi</HI> and <HI>Montrea's</HI> are for the most part Military; and the <HI>Berga Willala's.</HI> are Drovers.</P>
<P>The Family of the <HI>Corewa's</HI> have no setled Ha∣bitations, nor City to dwell in, but range up and down the Countrey with their Wives and Chil∣dren, sleeping in small Huts, which they build in those places where they come, and at their remo∣val pull them down, and with the rest of their Goods carry them away on Asses, which they keep for that purpose. They maintain themselves by making of <HI>Soupen</HI> and <HI>Tatous,</HI> which are little Fans wherewith they winnow their Rice, and Potlids to cover it when it boyls; they also fetch Salt from the Seaside on their Asses Custom-free, because they are poor, and their Asses carry but small Loads. The Women, who generally go with a Basket under their Arms, boasting them∣selves to be Fortune-tellers, get great Sums of Money from ignorant People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Perrea's</HI> (who are the Men, for the Women are call'd <HI>Perresies</HI>) are a very despicable People amongst these <HI>Heathens,</HI> not being accounted wor∣thy to be styl'd a Family, nor suffer'd to live near others, but dwell all together in a corner of the City, and in the Countrey have not their Habi∣tations in Villages, but in Houses built at a large distance; neither are they permitted, to fetch Water out of any Wells or Pits belonging to the Villages, but forc'd to dig some near their own Houses; nor may they go through any Street or Village wherein the <HI>Brahmans</HI> dwell, nay, are for∣bidden to enter the <HI>Pagode</HI> or Temple of their Gods <HI>Wistwow</HI> and <HI>Eswara;</HI> they do all manner of Drudgery which none else will undertake, and eat Horseflesh and the like Carrion; so that 'tis no wonder why the other Tribes not onely despise, but account them unclean, especially the chief <HI>Brahmans.</HI> This Family is divided into two Parries, the one call'd <HI>Perrea's,</HI> and the other <HI>Siripera's;</HI> which last are Tanners, Potters, and the like. The <HI>Perrea's,</HI> being the first, are of better esteem than the <HI>Siripera's,</HI> and therefore will never eat in any of their Houses; but the <HI>Siripera's</HI> are per∣mitted to eat in the <HI>Perrea's,</HI> where they shew them reverence by lifting up their Hands, and ri∣sing from their Seats. These, upon the decease of one of the <HI>Comittys, Ritties, Palies,</HI> and others, are oblig'd for a small Reward, to shave off their Beards and follow the Corps, when it is carry'd out of the City or Village to be burnt.</P>
<P>Every one of these Tribes must perform the Of∣fice which he hath once undertaken as long as he lives, without changing his Condition, and neither expect to be promoted, or fear to be degraded.</P>
<P>The Family of the <HI>Pulia's</HI> also is accounted un∣clean, and are much despis'd: for the other Tribes will not suffer them to come into their Houses, nor touch any thing that belongs to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> have their Denomination from one <HI>Brahma</HI> or <HI>Bramma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Original of the <HI>Brah∣mans.</HI></NOTE> from whom they boast their Extract; and though they ascribe the origi∣nal of the other Tribes likewise to him, yet they affirm that they have gotten the Name or <HI>Bramma</HI> because they proceed from the chiefest part of him, <HI>viz.</HI> the Head, as the <HI>Settrea's</HI> out of the Arms, the <HI>Weinsja's</HI> out of the Thumb, and the <HI>Soudra's</HI> out of the Feet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vedam</HI> is the Book of their Law.</NOTE>How and from whence this <HI>Brahman</HI> had his original, some of his Sect relate out of their <HI>Vedam</HI> after this manner: Before the World was created, <HI>Wistnow,</HI> that is, <HI>God,</HI> had some inclination to have a new place to recreate and delight himself in; are and that upon the Leaf of a Tree he swam on the Water (for according to their opinion there was nothing but God and Water before the Creation) like a little Child, with his great Toe in his Mouth, in the form of a Circle, in testimony that he is without beginning or end; and that God caus'd a Flower (in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Temara,</HI> and by us a Water-Llliy) to grow out of his Navel, and not long after out of that this <HI>Bramma</HI> sprang. So soon as he had receiv'd Life, he stood with great admiration, and consider'd from whence lie was deriv'd, which because he could not possible find out, God declar'd it to him;
<PB N="112" REF="88"/>whereupon he shew'd great signs of thankfulness and obedience; wherewith <HI>Westnow</HI> was so well pleas'd, that he gave <HI>Bramma</HI> power to create the World; who thereupon created the same, and gave Life to all things in it.</P>
<P><HI>Barthruerri,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> Writer, in his Book of the Way to Heaven, confirms this, and says, <HI>One of great prudence and understanding created this World;</HI> and more plainly in another place, <HI>Why hath</HI> Bramma <HI>made the Mountain Merouwa?</HI> and again in another, <HI>Bramma hath made nothing in the World that is constant;</HI> by which it appears, that this is really these <HI>Pagans</HI> opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> That this <HI>Bramma</HI> was the first Man (as they say) that by the power which God gave him, created the World, with all things therein. Yet neverthe∣less few amongst them positively ascrib'd the Creation of the World to one Man, but either to God himself or his Son; whence we may suppose, that the <HI>Brahmans</HI> judge their foremen∣tion'd Chief to be the Head of the Angels, or the Son of God. These further affirm, that this <HI>Bramma</HI> had anciently five Heads but from the power which had been given him growing more ambitious, he attempted to defile <HI>Eswara, Wist∣now</HI>'s Consort, which when he heard, he was so enraged, that he caus'd her to bring forth the Daemon <HI>Beirewa,</HI> the chief of the Devils, who with his Claws scratch'd off the middlemost Head of <HI>Bramma,</HI> as a punishment for his bold at∣tempt; so that he kept onely four, Heads, with which he is represented in their <HI>Pagode:</HI> Not long after which <HI>Bramma</HI> made many Verses in praise of <HI>Eswara,</HI> who was so delighted therewith, that she promis'd to let him live in great Honor and Repute with his four Heads, and put the fifth on her own.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Bramma,</HI> as the <HI>Brahmans</HI> affirm, shall in the other World serve in a lower Degree; and that <HI>Annemonta,</HI> a faithful Servant to <HI>Wistnow,</HI> shall enjoy his Place, all which will be inflicted on him as a punishment for his ambition.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Brahmans</HI> do not onely ascribe the Creation of the World to this <HI>Bramma,</HI> but also the Government thereof; God (as they say) not once taking cognisance of it; for they alledge, that as a King will not take the trouble upon him to Govern his Realm himself, but appoint Vice-Roys or Lieutenants for that purpose; so likewise God doth not concern himself with the Govern∣ment of this World, but gave the Charge there∣of to <HI>Bramma.</HI></P>
<P>The same <HI>Brathrouherri</HI> in the foremention'd Book, ascribes the limitation of time which a Man is to live here on Earth to <HI>Bramma,</HI> saying. <HI>The longest time which</HI> Bramma <HI>hath granted Men to live, is a hundred years;</HI> and, <HI>All things which happen to Mankind on Earth, is by the appointment of</HI> Bramma; which in his Book of good Conversation he thus expresses, <HI>According as</HI> Bramma <HI>designs, so it shall be: for it is with a Man as with the Bird</HI> Tzataca, <HI>who whether it Rains much or little, he gets not above one drop thereof:</HI> His meaning is, That though a Man strive never so much to raise his Fortune, it will be in vain: for whatever <HI>Bramma</HI> hath ap∣pointed for him, he shall attain to, and no more. The Bird <HI>Tzataca,</HI> as the <HI>Brammans</HI> relate, drinks not of the Water which falls on the Earth, but in rainy Weather holds open his Bill to receive the Drops, so that whether it Rains much or little it avails not, the Bird not being able to take above a Drop at once.</P>
<P>The same Author affirms in another place, that whatever <HI>Bramma</HI> hath decreed for Man∣kind, that will happen to him, and if any one be poor, it is by his appointment: <HI>For</HI> (saith he) <HI>he hath appointed the Winds to feed the Serpents, and the Grass for Beasts;</HI> whereby it appears, that this <HI>Bramma</HI> is the principal, who hath some others under him, to whom he commits the care of some peculiar Places; but these are not accounted Gods, but onely <HI>Geweta's,</HI> or Angels. The most eminent of them is a <HI>Dewendre,</HI> who bears great sway, and is chief over all the Heads of the eight Worlds: to seven whereof (they say) those that have liv'd well here, go after their Decease, and are all commanded by <HI>Dewendre,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Indre,</HI> as the supream Governor, besides whom every Place hath a peculiar Tutelary Angel, who Commands one of the eight Worlds, which are plac'd above the Earth. Next follow the fore∣mention'd eight Worlds, lying between ours and <HI>Bramma-lokon,</HI> that is, <HI>The Residence of Bramma,</HI> the one in the North, the other in the South; the <HI>Brahmans</HI> call them as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> the first <HI>Indre-Lokon,</HI> where <HI>Dewendre</HI> or <HI>Indre</HI> hath his Residence; the second, <HI>Achmi-Lokon;</HI> the third, <HI>Jamma-Lokon,</HI> which is Hell, wherein the Wick∣ed are punish'd; the fourth, <HI>Niauti-Lokon;</HI> the fifth, <HI>Warronna-Lokon;</HI> the sixth, <HI>Cubera-Lokon;</HI> the seventh, <HI>Wajouvia;</HI> and the eighth, <HI>Isangja-Lokon:</HI> But these Worlds are not such as we in∣habit, onely places of happiness like the <HI>Elysian</HI> Fields.</P>
<P>Besides the care which these Governors have of their peculiar Places, they have other Concerns to look after, <HI>viz. Achmi</HI> hath the Charge over the Fire; <HI>Warrouna</HI> commands the Waters; <HI>Wa∣jouvia,</HI> the Wind; <HI>Cubera,</HI> Riches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Some account this <HI>Bramma</HI> to be the same with <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and accordingly the <HI>Brahmans</HI> have some Books, which they firmly believe to be <HI>Py∣thagoras</HI>'s own Works, which agrees with what <HI>Jarchas</HI> (according to <HI>Philostratus</HI>) told <HI>Apollonius Thyaneus, viz.</HI> That the <HI>Indians</HI> believ'd that which <HI>Pythagoras</HI> taught them concerning the Soul, and instructed the <HI>Egyptians</HI> therein. But <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> who writ the Life of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> makes mention in no place, that ever he was in <HI>In∣dia,</HI> or that he had any acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antance with the <HI>Brah∣mans;</HI> therefore it is to be suppos'd, that if <HI>Py∣thagoras</HI> hath taught the <HI>Indians</HI> any thing of his Doctrine, he did it not himself, but by his Books, that perhaps were brought into these Countreys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The several Sects of the <HI>Brahmans.</HI></NOTE>These <HI>Brahmans</HI> differing amongst themselves, are divided into six several Sects, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Wist∣nowa, Sciva, Smarta, Scharwacka, Pasinda,</HI> and <HI>Tschecktea,</HI> which have each their peculiar Fol∣lowers. The <HI>Wistnowa's</HI> account <HI>Wistnow</HI> the su∣pream God, and none equal to him, and from him they take their Denomination.</P>
<P>This Sect is again divided into two, the one call'd <HI>Tadwadi Wistnowa,</HI> or <HI>Madwa Wistnowa,</HI> and the othe <HI>Ramanouja Wistnowa. Tadwadi</HI> signifies a Disputer, and <HI>Tadwa</HI> Knowledge of God: for the Followers thereof are accounted great Disputers, knowing how to discourse of God and all his Works, firmly maintaining all their Arguments. The Name <HI>Madwa</HI> is deriv'd from one <HI>Madway As∣jaria,</HI> who (as they say) was the first Promoter and Raiser of this Sect; as also the Name of <HI>Ram∣nouja,</HI> from one <HI>Ramanouja Asjarr,</HI> the Promoter of the Sect <HI>Ramanouja, Wistnowa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Westnowa's</HI> have each a peculiar way and
<PB N="113" REF="88"/>manner to know one another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies of the <HI>Tad∣wadistes</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Tadwadistes</HI> mark themselves daily with a white Stroak, which from their Forehead comes down their Nose, and with a round Circle about the bigness of a Groat on their Temples, as also the upper part of the Arms near the Shoulder, and on both Breasts, which they say is the work of <HI>Wistnow,</HI> and serves as a Shield to defend them against the Devil and <HI>Jamma,</HI> the infernal Judge, that they dare not touch nor approach them.</P>
<P>They make Promises to <HI>Wistnow,</HI> to acknow∣ledge him for the onely God, to whom they owe Reverence and Obedience; neither do they think it sufficient to make the foremention'd Pro∣mise, but they must always lead a pious and vertu∣ous Life.</P>
<P>They are under one supream Head, who dwells up in the Countrey near the City <HI>Pallacatta,</HI> in a Place call'd <HI>Combeconne:</HI> He wears not the Cord call'd <HI>Tsandhan</HI> about his Neck, as the other <HI>Brah∣mans,</HI> neither hath he a Wife, but upon his entring into that Office he forsakes all worldly things, and commonly walks with a Cane in his Hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Rama∣nouja's</HI> Te∣nets.</NOTE>The <HI>Ramanouja Wistnowa's</HI> mark themselves with a Sign in form like the <HI>Greek</HI> Letter <HI>Ypsilon, viz.</HI> they begin from their Noses upwards to their Foreheads, which is done with a Stuff like Whi∣ting or Chalk. They also burn another Mark in their Flesh under their Armpits, which some ac∣count sufficient, thinking it needless to mark all their Limbs every day. This Sect think it enough when they have once with an upright Heart pro∣mis'd their God to be his Servants, and believe, that though they live wickedly all their days af∣ter, God will be merciful to them for that Promise sake; that <HI>Wistnow</HI> will never forsake those he once hath receiv'd into his favor, alledging, that a Father will not kill his Child, though it offend, that a Man cannot live without sin, and therefore it is impossible that <HI>Wistnow</HI> should cast off those whom once he lov'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ramanouja's Wistnowa's</HI> must go bare∣headed, with short Hair, except one Lock on the top of their Heads, which in a Knot hangs down their Neck. The supream Head of this Sect, who resides in the City <HI>Causjewaram,</HI> in the King∣dom of <HI>Carmatica,</HI> may from a peculiar Priviledge, wear a Cloth about his Head, yet not always, but onely when he speaks with any body.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ramanouja's</HI> esteem their Sect to be better than that of the <HI>Tadwadistes,</HI> because they are no Traders, nor frequent Houses of publick Enter∣tainments.</P>
<P>The second Sect of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> is call'd <HI>Sei∣via,</HI> or <HI>Ardhiha;</HI> the Followers thereof believe one <HI>Eswara</HI> to be the supream God, making all other Deities inferior to him, nay, <HI>Wistnow</HI> himself. They make two or three Stroaks with the Ashes of burn'd Cow-dung on their Foreheads. Some also wear a certain Stone call'd <HI>Lingama</HI> about their Necks, others in the Hair of their Heads, in testimony that they put their whole confidence in <HI>Eswara,</HI> and acknowledge no other God but him. Their Children also wear this Stone cover'd with Wax at a String ty'd about their Arms, when they come to be eight or ten years of age.</P>
<P>The third Sect is call'd <HI>Smarta,</HI> whose Promo∣ter was <HI>Sancra Atsjaria;</HI> the Followers of whom account <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara</HI> to be one and the same, though they worship them in two several Shapes. They wear no outward Marks of distin∣ction. Amongst the common People this Sect is not much esteem'd, and therefore hath not very many Followers, because their Opinion is some∣what above the Vulgars apprehension, as to the Deity of the two foremention'd Gods.</P>
<P>The fourth Sect is call'd <HI>Scharwaka;</HI> the Fol∣lowers whereof, after the opinion of the <HI>Epicure∣ans,</HI> believe no Life after this; and whatever others alledge to demonstrate it, they deny, and will not be convinc'd without a peculiar Demon∣stration.</P>
<P>The fifth Sect is call'd <HI>Pasenda,</HI> the Followers whereof affirm, that the Doctrine taught amongst the <HI>Heathens</HI> is irrational and senceless, and there∣fore they regard it not, but onely mind their Bel∣lies, and let all things run at random, belie∣ving also with the <HI>Scharwaka's,</HI> that the Soul of a Man dies with his Body: <HI>For how</HI> (say they) <HI>is it possible, that the Body of a Man, being burnt to Ashes, should ever come to life again?</HI> But this Argument they maintain not against the <HI>Christian</HI> Belief of the Resurrection of the Dead (of which they have no knowledge,) but contradict the <HI>Heathens</HI> Opi∣nion herein, who set down a certain time, after the expiration of which all things shall be as they are now.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annus Plato∣nicus.</NOTE> This Opinion was held by <HI>Plato</HI> and others, who make the time to be thirty six thou∣sand years.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pasenda's</HI> are by the <HI>Brahmans</HI> esteem'd worse than those of the fourth Sect, not onely for this their Opinion, but also because like Beasts they make no distinction between Father and Mother, Brother and Sister. They eat with all Men, and sleep by any Women, alledging, that in the Person of another Woman they lie with their own Wives, and for a good Name amongst Men they regard it not; yet they are afraid to dispute their Opinion with the other Sects, as fearing they should suffer Death, for the other be∣ing provok'd with indignation against their wick∣ed and abominable manner of living, would cer∣tainly fall upon, and kill them, as hath often hap∣ned, to the ruine and destruction of many of these Atheists.</P>
<P>The sixth Sect call'd <HI>Tschectea,</HI> neither Believe in <HI>Wistnow</HI> nor <HI>Eswara,</HI> but acknowledge one <HI>Tschecti</HI> for the supream God, from whom they af∣firm <HI>Wistnow, Eswara,</HI> and <HI>Bramma</HI> to have had their original, and also their power; and likewise that the World and all things in the same proceeded and had their Being from him.</P>
<P>These three last Sects being by the <HI>Brahmans</HI> accounted superstitious, have but few Followers of their wicked Opinions.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Brahmans</HI> who by their retir'd way of living are separated from the others, are call'd <HI>Jaques.</HI> All other People that live so retiredly, are either the <HI>Wanaprasta's,</HI> or <HI>Sanjasies,</HI> or <HI>Ava∣doutes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Wanaprasta's</HI> go with their Wives and Children into the Wood, where they live on Roots and Fruits, without doing any kind of Labor.</P>
<P>Some are of so scrupulous a Conscience, that they will not pluck the least Root out of the Ground, fearing to sin, and be the occasion of di∣sturbing a transmigrated Soul, which perhaps might be in the same.</P>
<P>This kind of living in the Woods is amongst them accounted a great piece of Religion, and the Maintainers thereof look'd upon as a very holy People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sanjasies</HI> are a People that pretend to de∣spise
<PB N="114" REF="89"/>the World and all earthly things, and are much more retir'd than the <HI>Wanaprasta's,</HI> and are not permitted to Marry, to chew <HI>Betel,</HI> or eat and drink above once a day, and then not out of Cop∣per, but earthen Vessels: Moreover, they live on the Alms of others. They go Cloth'd in Linnen, colour'd with red Earth, and carry a long Cane in their Hands; they may not so much as touch Gold or Silver, much less be Possessors of any Money. They judge it unholy to stay above one Night in a place, and therefore are continually travelling from one place to another. They are also oblig'd to conquer five Enemies, <HI>viz. Cama,</HI> that is Desire; <HI>Croota,</HI> Anger; <HI>Lopa,</HI> Covetous∣ness; <HI>Madda,</HI> Pride, and affection for transitory things; and lastly <HI>Mattzara, Concupiscence.</HI> In this Conquest they are to persevere all the days of their Lives, studying spiritual things.</P>
<P>Those that lead this kind of Life, and are of the Family of the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> are call'd <HI>Sanjasies</HI> for their excellency; but <HI>Permaansa</HI> if of the <HI>Tettrean</HI> or <HI>Weinsjan</HI> Tribe, and <HI>Jogies</HI> of the <HI>Soudrean;</HI> whlch last take more freedom in their manner of living than the true <HI>Sanjasies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Avadou∣ta's</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Avadouta's</HI> being the third sort of <HI>Brahmans</HI> that live retiredly, not onely forsake their Wives and Children like the <HI>Sanjasies,</HI> but pretend to greater Holiness, abstaining from many things which the <HI>Sanjasies</HI> regard not, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Avadou∣ta's</HI> wear onely a piece of Cotton Cloth before their Privities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of living.</NOTE> and some (though few) nothing at all, but go stark naked, without the least shame; neither do they use Earthen Vessels, nor walk with a Cane or any other kind of Staff, all which the <HI>Heathens</HI> look upon as a sign of their Perfe∣ction, and as a testimony of their despising the World and all things therein. They also strew Ashes over their Bodies, and when hungry, go into a House without speaking, and beg Alms by holding out their Hands, which the <HI>Pagans</HI> im∣mediately understanding (for they know them by their going naked,) give them part of what they have in the House, which they presently eat up before they stir. Some of them will not so much as go into the Street to get Alms, but are conten∣ted to sit down by some River or other which the Inhabitants accounted holy, and there expect such Food, as the People that dwell thereabouts will bring them, which indeed is done in a plentiful manner, for they furnish them with Milk, Fruit, and other Food, because they account it a very pious Work.</P>
<P>Those amongst the <HI>Brahmans</HI> that live most re∣serv'd, and are earnest in maintaining of their Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Boti</HI></NOTE> perform the Office of Priests, and are call'd <HI>Boti,</HI> being had in great honor and reputation; they live on Alms, never Marry, despise all tran∣sitory things, and to all outward appearance live very precisely, yet many of them commit most abominable Crimes in secret.</P>
<P>In most parts of <HI>India</HI> there reside a pensive sort of People, who either through the passion of Love, or the death of a Relation whom they highly esteem, or some other Misfortune, forsaking their native Countreys out of a desperate humor, take great Journeys, and range about like Vagabonds, nothing at all considering or fearing any ill that may befall them.</P>
<P>These kind of People, if Idolaters, are call'd <HI>Giogi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Giogi.</HI></NOTE> otherwise <HI>Jogies;</HI> but if <HI>Mahumetans, Der∣wies,</HI> and <HI>Abbali,</HI> and <HI>Abdalla's;</HI> the last go almost stark naked, wearing onely a piece of Leather on their Backs like a Badge, and carrying a Staff or Cane in thir Hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habi∣tations and Study.</NOTE>These <HI>Giogi</HI> have no other Dwelling-places than the Portals of the <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples, or under the Shades of large Trees, or the open Skie. They chiefly study Natural Magick, and the several Vertues of Herbs, Plants, and the like, as also Sorcery and Conjurations, boasting thereby, and by Prayer and Fasting to do great Wonders, and that they have strange Revelations, whenas in∣deed they attain not to the knowledge of any thing by any other Art than the help of the Devil, who appearing to them in several Shapes, deludes them; nay, they have familiar Conversation with him, yet imagine the contrary, affirming them∣selves to be onely familiar with certain immortal and unknown Women, to the number of forty, which they distinguish by their several Shapes and Names assum'd by them. They honor them as Goddesses; and not onely the <HI>Indians,</HI> but also the <HI>Moorish</HI> Kings shew them great Reverence, keeping great Festivals, and making annual Offe∣rings to them in certain deep Pits, wherein they say they reside. Wherefore if any of these <HI>Giogi,</HI> after long Fasting and Praying, can attain to the presence of one of the said Women, and by that means have future things reveal'd to them, they are for ever after highly esteem'd amongst their Sect; but much more if he can attain to that de∣gree of being her Brother, or any other step of Relation to her; but most of all, if he can attain to be her Husband: for then he is cry'd up as a Saint, and said to have gotten more than humane Nature.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Live under one Head.</NOTE>These <HI>Giogi</HI> are very exact in their Prognosti∣cation, and live in common under the Obedience of one supream Head, but stand not in that awe of him as the <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> of their Superior; neither is he onely respected by his Followers, but also held in great esteem by Persons of Qua∣lity, who also shew Obedience to him, kiss his Hands, and often stand by him in a melancholy posture to hear him speak, accounting his Voice like that of an Oracle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Giogi</HI> go all naked, onely covering their Privities with a small Lappet: They wear their Hair very long, and let it hang carelesly over their Shoulders, and oftentimes out of a strange super∣stitious humor, paint their Foreheads with <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, Saffron, and other colours, either yellow, white or red, but keep the rest of their Body very neat and clean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another sort of <HI>Giogies.</HI></NOTE>There are likewise other <HI>Giogies,</HI> who lead a more strict Life, but are very slovenly, first co∣louring their Bodies black, and afterwards whi∣ting it with a Stone like Chalk. They also fre∣quently strew Ashes upon themselves, to put them in mind of their mortality: They let the Hair of their Heads and Beards grow very long, wearing them very carelesly, and often painting them with divers colours, which makes them look more like Devils than Men.</P>
<P>These <HI>Giogi</HI> are undoubtedly the same with the ancient <HI>Gymnosophists,</HI> who liv'd after the same manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther bas∣er sort.</NOTE>There are also another sort of People almost like these <HI>Giogi,</HI> who also strew Ashes on their Bodies; they are of a despised Tribe of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> being unclean, slovenly, and beastial, for they eat of all things that come before them, without making the least scruple, nay, of those Beasts, which others account an abomination to touch;

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> wherefore they are by the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Language call'd <HI>Halalchor,</HI> that is, <HI>Eat-alls:</HI> But the <HI>Indians</HI> in their Language name them <HI>Der,</HI> and abhor their Company and Conversation. They are all very poor, living generally on Alms, or on what they can get by their Labor, which they freely bestow in the most despicable and filthiest Employments of the Commonalty; which they do, either because they therein obey their Laws, which prescribe them such a kind of Life; or else out of necessity, for a Maintenance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vertiaes,</HI> their manner of life</NOTE>There are also <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Vertiaes,</HI> which shave their Heads. <HI>Peruschi</HI> tells us, That the <HI>Vertiaes</HI> live together in great numbers, go cloth'd in White, with bald Heads, and bare Chins; for they pluck out the Hair by the Roots, leaving onely a little Tuft on the Crown of their Heads. They live poorly upon Alms, remain single, and drink warm Water, because they believe the Wa∣ter to have a Soul, and that they should kill that Soul which God hath created, if they should drink it cold. For the same reason they constant∣ly carry little Brooms, or rather Mops, in their Hands, made of Cotton Thrums, with which, as they walk, they sweep the Ground, so to prevent accidental treading on any Animal: Wherefore some will not sit down before they have swept the place very carefully where they intend to rest themselves. They are under one Supreme Head to the number of a hundred thousand, and wear a piece of Cloth of about four fingers broad be∣fore their Mouthes, with a hole on each side, through which they put their Ears.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Opi∣nions.</NOTE>They say that the World hath been created many hundred thousands of years, and that God in the beginning sent twenty three Apostles, and a four and twentieth in this third Age, which is not above two thousand years past, since which they receiv'd written Laws, which before they had not. The Opinion of their Sect is written in Books, with <HI>Surat</HI> Letters and Characters.</P>
<P>There are several other Sects, which differ very little from those beforemention'd; as the <HI>Janje∣ma,</HI> the <HI>Giaugami, &amp;c.</HI> and therefore we will not here any farther particularize concerning them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Priviledges of the <HI>Brahmans</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> have four things allow'd them in their <HI>Vedam</HI> or Law-book.</P>
<P>First, They may freely keep the Feast <HI>Ja∣gam.</HI> And,</P>
<P>Secondly, They are permitted to instruct others therein; whereas the <HI>Weinsja's</HI> and <HI>Soudra's</HI> may neither keep, nor learn the manner thereof.</P>
<P>Their third Privilege is to read the <HI>Vedam,</HI> and teach it to others; which is forbidden to all else, but especially to the Family of the <HI>Weinsja's,</HI> which may neither read it, speak any Words that are in it, nor hear them spoken by others; nor may they look into the <HI>Jastra,</HI> by which Name all Books are understood which treat of Religion.</P>
<P>Their fourth Privilege is, That they may give Alms if they please, and ask the Charitable Bene∣volence of others: And though those of other Families may give Alms, yet they are not allow'd to beg.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They give many Alms.</NOTE>In their Books they write much of giving Alms, highly extolling all Charitable Acts; though they themselves seldom practise it, unless perchance among some few of their fellow-<HI>Brah∣mans:</HI> And if any other Sect happen to come to their Gates or Doors, they have nothing but the Word <HI>Po, Po,</HI> that is. <HI>Away, away;</HI> because the <HI>Brahmans</HI> believe they should be defiled, if they should admit the Conversation of any other Tribe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Office.</NOTE>The Office and Exercise of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> agrees very much with that of the <HI>Levites</HI> amongst the <HI>Jews;</HI> yet some of them study Astronomy; others, Physick; others are put into Offices by Princes and Governors; some teach Children to read, write, and cypher: and all this, without re∣ceiving any Reward for their Pains. But those that are poor, and have little to live on, may take a small Reward from their Scholars.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> also govern and serve in the <HI>Pa∣godes;</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="90"/>and notwithstanding the large Munifi∣cence of their Kings, and though, they swallow a third part of the Revenue of the Countrey, yet by reason of their great number many of them are very poor, and forc'd to beg: However, the greatest Necessity must not compel them to learn any Trade, nor perform any servile Office, though for the King himself: For if any <HI>Brahman</HI> should offer to do the same, he would not onely be de∣spised by his Companions, but excommunicated. Nevertheless, they are permitted to be employ'd as Secretaries, Agents, Counsellors, and the like; for which Businesses they are very fit, and few Persons else follow those Employments.</P>
<P>In former Ages, in the time of King <HI>Rama-raia,</HI> the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> according to his Command, re∣ceiv'd onely one half of the Revenues of the Villages which had been given them before by his Predecessors, the other half being receiv'd by the Lords of the Countrey; but they have since re∣triv'd the whole Revenue into their own Hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Policy of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> to keep what they have got</NOTE>Sometimes the Countreys or Villages are taken from them, which to prevent, they use this means: <HI>viz.</HI> When the King hath given them a Village, they desire to part it amongst some of their Poor; which if granted, they have a Letter of License graven on a Copper Plate, by vertue of which they make their intended Division: And after this, such Places are never taken from them by the King, or any of his Successors. For, as they suppose it to be a Duty to do good to the <HI>Brah∣mans,</HI> which is a Work acceptable to their Gods <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara,</HI> whom they serve; so they believe likewise, that by doing them any preju∣dice, they should offend their foremention'd Dei∣ties, and incur their heavy displeasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies at the Birth of Children.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> never marry out of their own Tribe; for those which do so are accounted to be no <HI>Brahmans.</HI> And though any one, out of Zeal, or to be accounted a Saint, be permitted to lead the same course of life as the <HI>Brahmans;</HI> yet they cannot be made <HI>Brahmans,</HI> but must be so born.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> account all Children unclean during the space of ten days after their Birth (after the same manner as the Infants and Women in Child-bed amongst the <HI>Jews</HI>) none daring to touch them but those which tend them. Moreo∣ver, the House wherein the Child is born is accounted unclean during the foremention'd time; wherefore no Stranger or Friend is per∣mitted to go in till ten days are expir'd, after which, <HI>viz.</HI> on the eleventh day, the House is made clean, and all the Womans Clothes, being of Cotton, are wash'd; all Earthen Vessels are thrown away, and the Copper ones scowr'd.</P>
<P>On the twelfth day they make a <HI>Hamam,</HI> or Fire, which they account Holy, and throwing Myrrhe into it, say several Prayers, After the Fire is extinguish'd, they give the Child such a Name as is usual amongst them; as <HI>Mainopa, Na∣raina, Beiaewa, Damersa, Padmanaba, Ragoa, Tirre∣nata, Marlepa, Dewela, Tannopa, Carpa, Wellopa, Rama, Goyenda, Warreda, Weinketi,</HI> or others of that kind. The Child thus nam'd, they make Holes in the Ears, wishing it also much joy and felicity. This making Holes in the Ears is not done to hang Jewels therein, as many do; but is done in compliance with a Promise of Obedience made to <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara,</HI> and for a Testimony that they will ever acknowledge them as their Deities, and ever be constant in their Religion.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Children of the <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> are <HI>Brahmans</HI> in respect of their Extract, yet they are not so accounted before they have got∣ten the Cord call'd <HI>Dsanhem</HI> about their Necks. This <HI>Dsanhem</HI> is like fine Packthred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cord <HI>Dsanhem</HI> to be worn by the Children of the <HI>Brah∣mans.</HI></NOTE> consisting of three Strings, each of nine fine Cotton Threds. None but <HI>Brahmans</HI> make these Cords, and onely with their Hands, without a Wheel, or any other Tools. They wear the same like a Gold Chain, letting it hang on their left Shoulder, cross their Breasts, under their right Arm. About the fifth Year of their Age the <HI>Brahmans</HI> Children begin to wear the said Cord, though they may forbear till they are ten Years old; and commonly those that are of a poor Capacity stay till the tenth Year before they wear the <HI>Dsanhem,</HI> which can∣not be put on without a considerable Charge; for the foremention'd Fire <HI>Homam,</HI> which is made on a rising Ground, under a Canopy of stretch'd∣out Linnen, must be kept lighted four days with the Wood <HI>Rawasittow</HI> (the Tree whereof they account very holy, and believe that it is most ac∣ceptable to their Gods) on which every <HI>Brahman</HI> throws Rice in the Ears, also some boyl'd, toge∣ther with Butter, the Seed <HI>Zingele,</HI> Wheat, and Myrrhe, whilst they say several Prayers, and use many other Ceremonies. Moreover, the Parents of the Children must during the time of four days entertain the <HI>Brahmans</HI> which attend the Ceremo∣ny, which stands the Nobility in great Sums of Money.</P>
<P>The Children having received the Cord, which is done in <HI>August,</HI> on the Feast <HI>Traswanala Poudewa,</HI> at the Full of the Moon, are call'd <HI>Bramasory's,</HI> which Name they hold till they marry: Neither may they by vertue of the <HI>Vedam</HI> lie with any Women in that time, nor chew any <HI>Betel,</HI> or eat above once a day, and then of no other Food but what is begg'd, that by their Abstinence they may be the more capable of Learning.</P>
<P>This Cord is highly esteem'd amongst them; insomuch that if, age having worn it out, it chan∣ces to break, a <HI>Brahman</HI> is not allow'd to eat or drink before he hath another; for he that hath not a <HI>Dsanhem,</HI> though he be a <HI>Brahman,</HI> is not ac∣counted one amongst them so long as he hath no Cord: Therefore, by way of prevention, they always yearly renew their Cords in <HI>August,</HI> on the Feast <HI>Tsrawannala Poudewa,</HI> in the time of the Full Moon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Igno∣rance in A∣stronomy and Philosophy.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> are very ignorant in Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, not being able to give a Reason of the Sun or Moons Eclipse, or any Conjunction of the Stars; yet despise they the <HI>Europeans</HI> Knowledge in Astronomy, and sup∣port their own with this ridiculous Fable.</P>

<P>The <HI>Dewetaes</HI> and <HI>Raetsjasjaes</HI> were order'd to draw the Mountain, in which work while they were busie, it produc'd many strange Wonders; and amongst other things, a Poyson call'd <HI>Calecote Wisjam,</HI> which was so venomous, that it infected all the World, which was forc'd to call for aid to <HI>Wistnow:</HI> When <HI>Eswara</HI> observing that the Peo∣ple were in great pain by this Poyson, she, out of the affection which she bare to them, swal∣low'd

<P>After this, there appear'd a most beautiful Woman, admir'd and coveted by all; but at last <HI>Wistnow</HI> took her to himself for his Wife; she being call'd <HI>Laetsemi,</HI> hath a place in the Tem∣ple of <HI>Wistnow,</HI> wherein her Image stands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Immor∣tal Liquor.</NOTE>Not long after, when they had turn'd the Mountain round several times, there appear'd that which they had consulted about; <HI>viz.</HI> the thing which should take away Hunger, Drought, and Faintness, and procure Immortality to such as drank thereof. This excellent <HI>Elixir,</HI> by the <HI>Brahmans</HI> call'd <HI>Amortam,</HI> is a Liquor like Milk; wherefore the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> which dare not drink Water in any House, are allow'd to drink Milk.</P>
<P>When <HI>Wistnow</HI> had made this discovery, re∣solving to refresh the faint and wearied <HI>Dewetaes</HI> and <HI>Raetsjasjaes,</HI> he commanded them to stand be∣fore him, giving some of the <HI>Amortam</HI> out of one Pot to the <HI>Dewetaes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">It is denied to the <HI>Raets∣jasjaes.</HI></NOTE> but to the <HI>Raetsjasjaes,</HI> to whom he had not so much kindness, he gave somewhat else out of the same Pot, which was of no value.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sedition of <HI>Kagou</HI> and <HI>Ketou.</HI></NOTE> But <HI>Kagou</HI> and <HI>Ketou,</HI> two <HI>Raetsjasjaes,</HI> suspecting the fallacy, went and stood amongst the <HI>Dewetaes,</HI> by which means they got also some of the <HI>Amortam;</HI> which the Sun and Moon see∣ing, inform'd <HI>Wistnow</HI> of. Whereupon <HI>Wistnow</HI> inrag'd to think that they should drink of the <HI>Amortam,</HI> caus'd both their Heads to be cut off: Yet they died not, because they had drank of this for the injury which they had suffer'd, demand∣ing why the <HI>Amortam</HI> was not given to them equally with their Companions. <HI>Wistnow,</HI> in answer to <HI>Kagou</HI> and <HI>Ketou,</HI> commanded them henceforth to be without Bodies; yet they should live as happy as others with Bodies. Now by reason the Sun and Moon had made that com∣plaint of them, they were incens'd with a per∣petual hatred against them; and when ever ei∣ther of those Luminaries are Eclipsed, they af∣firm that <HI>Kagou</HI> and <HI>Ketou</HI> are in Battel with them; and that the darkness proceeds from hence, be∣cause they are swallow'd up for a little while by their Adversaries, which have the shapes of Ser∣pents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> Children.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> marry their Children very young, especially the Rich; many about their eighth year, and some immediately after the re∣ceiving of the Cord <HI>Dsanhem</HI> in their fifth year: for before the receiving of this Cord, neither the <HI>Brahmans, Settreaes,</HI> nor <HI>Weinsjaes</HI> may marry. The Maid must always be elder than the Youth, which is strictly observ'd.</P>
<P>A <HI>Brahman</HI> takes special notice of all things that he meets with in the way when he goes to chuse a Wife for his Son; and as often as he meets any thing which he judges ominous or un∣fortunate, so oft he returns, and defers his intent.</P>
<P>If those of the Family <HI>Weinsja</HI> meet a Serpent on the day when they go to make their first Vi∣sit, they look upon it as an ill omen, giving over their Suit, and will never be brought to renew their Addresses, judging that it will prove a most unfortunate and bad Marriage.</P>
<P>The Maidens Fathers, to whom the Addresses for Marriage are made, commonly desire to see the Young Man, and make inquiry into his Estate; which if they approve, and like the Suitor, then he is permitted to go to her Friends, and to see the Maid.</P>
<P>After the Consent of both Parties is obtain'd for the Marriage, then a time is appointed, on a Good day, for the Friends to meet to celebrate the Ceremonies.</P>
<P>When the appointed time of the Marriages is come, then they kindle the Fire <HI>Homam,</HI> made of the Wood of their consecrated Tree <HI>Rawasittow;</HI> and a <HI>Boti</HI> or Priest repeats several Prayers. After this, the Bridegroom takes three Handfuls of Rice, which he throws on the Brides Head, who
<PB N="118" REF="91"/>doth the same to him; which done, the Brides Father according to his Quality adorns the Bride, and also dressing the Bridegroom, washes his Feet.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Father taking his Daughter by the Hand, puts into same Water (if he be rich) Money and Jewels, and gives it to the Bridgroom in the Name of God, saying, <HI>I have nothing more to do with you; I here give her to you.</HI> When the Father gives his Daughers Hand to the Bride∣groom; he also gives with her a Precious Gem call'd <HI>Tali,</HI> which being a Golden Head of an Idol fastned to a String, is shew'd to the Specta∣tors, and, after some Prayers, and Good Wishes, is by the Bridgroom tied about the Brides Neck; and this confirms the Marriage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marriage proclaim'd.</NOTE>All these Ceremonies are perform'd in the Brides Father's House; besides which, the Con∣firmation of the Marriage (because it is a Business which concerne the Publick Good; and a thing necessary to be known) is openly proclaim'd, and notified to all Persons: For before they confirm the Marriage, some days before the celebrating thereof, they set an Arbor as a Sign before the Bride's Door, as also four <HI>Pisang</HI> Trees, if they can get them. This Canopy is properly four erected Poles, which being about seven Foot high, are cover'd on the top with small Sticks, on which they lay green Boughs, and wind the Poles round about with <HI>Pisang</HI> Leaves in sign of joy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bride carried home in State</NOTE>On the seventh day the Bride and Bridegroom go abroad, or else are carry'd in a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> through the most eminent Streets of the City, with many Torches, Cimbals, and Fire-works before them, accompany'd by all their Friends: And thus the Bride is publickly carried to her Husbands House.</P>
<P>The Married Children of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> are no more call'd <HI>Brahmasaries,</HI> but <HI>Garhasta's,</HI> when they receive a second Cord, consisting of three Strings like the first. Every ten years that they increase in their age, they add another Cord to the former, and also another at the Birth of eve∣ry Child: But this is not so exactly observ'd by all; yet the more zealous they are in their Paga∣nism, the more strictly they oblige themselves to these Circumstances.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They marry not out of their own Tribe.</NOTE>They never marry their Children, whether Sons or Daughters, to any but those of their own Family; which those of other Tribes also observe, unless to those of a higher Degree: But the <HI>Brahmans</HI> cannot be deceiv'd thereby, because there are none above them. Yet there are some <HI>Brahmans</HI> which marry Wives out of other Tribes, but it is accounted so heinous a sin, that their Companions believe they can never be admitted into Paradise.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Poranes</HI> or Ancient Histories also relate, That a <HI>Brahman</HI> of great Quality, call'd <HI>Sandra∣goupeti Naraia,</HI> was very melancholy in his old age, because his Son <HI>Barthrouherri</HI> was born of a Woman of the <HI>Soudran</HI> Family; for he afterwards had familiarity with three hundred Women.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abhor Forni∣cation.</NOTE>They abhor Fornication, accounting it one of the five deadly sins; and, according to their <HI>Ve∣dam,</HI> he that so transgresses should have his Geni∣tals cut off, and so bleed to death: Also they per∣mit none to marry within the Degrees of Con∣sanguinity: But they differ very much from the <HI>European</HI> Nations in reckoning their Rela∣tions and Allies with whom they are not permit∣ted to marry; for they are allow'd to marry with their first Wifes Sister, nay, they may marry two, three, or more Sisters at once; but if two Bro∣thers marry two Sisters, it is accounted Fornicati∣on. They may also marry their Fathers Sisters Daughter; but not their Fathers Brothers Daughter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> seldom desert their Wives, though taken in the act of Adultery; partly, be∣cause it should not be publish'd, and so redownd to their disgrace; and partly out of the extraordi∣nary affection which they bear to their Wives, and therefore endeavor to keep all their miscar∣riages secret: But if it be known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Womans Punishment offending in such case.</NOTE> and civil Peo∣ple thereupon avoid coming to the House, and they, on the contrary, out of an affection to their Wives, have a mind to enjoy them honourably, then they makes a great Feast, to which they in∣vite many <HI>Brahmans</HI> and <HI>Sanjasys,</HI> on whom the Adulteress is to wait at the Table, which they look upon as a sufficient Punishment for her Of∣fence. But if a Woman with her own free will consented to, or sought to commit, the foremen∣tion'd Crime, then they immure her, where she is is kept so long as she lives with a slender allow∣ance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Obser∣vers of Days and Times.</NOTE>They are great Observers of Critical days, and will not undertake any Business unless preceded by some good Day or happy Omen.</P>
<P>When they intend to go a Journey, they often set out before their time, if a good Day or fortu∣nate Hour happens: And that they may the bet∣ter know these times exactly, they have Books written after the manner of our Almanacks, which they call <HI>Panjangam,</HI> and are of two several sorts; the one made by a <HI>Brahaspeti,</HI> Teacher to the <HI>Dewetaes;</HI> the other by <HI>Succra,</HI> Tutor to the <HI>Raets∣jasjaes,</HI> that is, <HI>The Chief of Devils.</HI> The first in∣structs, That some Days are good, and some half good; as also some Hours. According to these <HI>Panjangams</HI> the People of this Countrey govern themselves, they being made new every Year, like our Almanacks. The last are very exact; for they make Observations on every one of the sixty Hours, whereinto, according to their Ac∣count, the Day and Night is divided; declaring whether they are fortunate or not, and what may be done or let alone in every Hour; for which they highly esteem this <HI>Panjangam,</HI> supposing it infallible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their good and bad days.</NOTE>As to what concerns the Good and Bad Days, the <HI>Amawasi,</HI> or first Day after the last Quarter of the Moon, is good: The <HI>Padeni,</HI> or first Day af∣ter the New Moon, before it is seen, is bad; as on the contrary, the <HI>Widdia,</HI> or Day on which the Moon first appears, is good: The fourth Day, and the <HI>Lecadesi,</HI> or ninth Day after the New Moon, are both bad; as also the eleventh, their Fast-day, if it happens on a <HI>Wednesday;</HI> but good, if on another day. And thus they reckon their Good and Bad Days throughout the whole Year, going from the Full to the New Moon. Moreo∣ver, they judge of the Hours and Minutes by the Accidents that happen to them, and narrowly observe the same.</P>
<P>They all account it a good Omen when the Bird <HI>Garrouda</HI> (which is a reddish Hawk, with a white Circle about his Neck) or the Bird <HI>Pala,</HI> flie from their right to their left side, or before them as they walk: But the contrary in other Birds; for if they flie before them cross the way, from the left hand to the right, it is a good sign; and a bad one, if from the right to the left. If
<PB N="119" REF="91"/>any be touch'd by Jackdaw (of which there are many here in this Countrey) flying, it is a very bad Omen; and they certainly believe, that ei∣ther the Party which is to touch'd, or some of his Relations will infallibly die within six Weeks. To Sneeze as they travel is accounted very ill, insomuch that if it happen in any House, they will surely turn back. Many other things of that nature they observe from all Adventures they meet with, from whence they commonly conclude a good or bad event of the Business which they have in hand.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> Beha∣vior in their Chambers.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> behave themselves in their Chambers after this manner: They generally rise two, or at least one hour before Sun-rise, and call upon the Name of God as soon as they awake; this done, they warn their Faces, Hands, and Feet, and then set themselves down on a Plank or Carpet, with their Faces towards the East or North; being thus seated, they begin to Sing the History of <HI>Gasjendre Mootsjam,</HI> and afterwards, if they have time, another Anthem in praise of God; then standing up, they wash their Hands and Mouth, nay, their whole Body in a consecrated Stream, or other Water, as convenience will ad∣mit, and then put on clean Clothes; when they are Dress'd, they set themselves down a second time on the place where they sat before, and cause fresh Water to be brought them, which taking up in their Hands three several times, they throw it into their Mouthes in the Name of God; when the Sun rises, they take up Water three times, and having said a short Prayer, throw the same on the Ground in honor of the Sun, and then wor∣ship it, and the chief of the lower Region, because
<PB N="120" REF="92"/>they are the best of Gods Servants; after this they worship an Image call'd <HI>Salagramma,</HI> which is of Stone, with a Hole in the middle, and make Offerings to it of <HI>Sandal</HI> wood, sweet-smelling Flowers, and the Herb <HI>Toleje,</HI> all which they do in a praying posture; this done, they repair to a Copper Image, which stands somewhat higher, and Offer the same things to it as to <HI>Salagramma;</HI> on each side of this they set one, two, or more Candles, according to their pleasure, and after∣wards set Meat ready dress'd before it, or else Milk and Fruit; lastly, throwing Flowers upon the Image, they walk thrice round it from their right Hand, and as many times as they have walk'd round, so often they must kneel before the Image; then they set, themselves down by it, and sprinkle the Water <HI>Tiertum</HI> on their Heads, and put some of it into their Mouthes with a little of the Herb <HI>Toleje,</HI> and also into their Ears, yet no other but what hath been already Offer'd, and black their Foreheads with <HI>Angaram,</HI> that is the Coals of the Offer'd <HI>Benjamin:</HI> This colouring their Foreheads with <HI>Angaram</HI> serves, as they say, as a Buckler against Sin; the <HI>Toleje</HI> which they put in their Ears, against the uncleanness which might defile them by touching any dead thing; neither (as they believe) can the Devil approach any that wear it: The Water <HI>Tiertum,</HI> they say, cleanses them from all their sins which they have committed from their very Childhood. When the <HI>Brahmans</HI> have thus wash'd and mark'd them∣selves, they sprinkle a little <HI>Tiertum</HI> towards those that are near them, and burn some Myrrh. These Ceremonies perform'd, they go again to their Idol, strew Flowers upon him, or else <HI>Toleje,</HI> set∣ting Meat that is dress'd for them before it; for they are not allow'd to eat any Meat but what hath first been plac'd before the Idol: After Din∣ner they cleanse themselves again: Towards the Evening before the Sun set, they wash and mark their Bodies as before, and also say their <HI>Japon,</HI> that is naming God twenty four several times, and throw Water upon the Ground in honor of the Sun as in the Morning.</P>
<P>In this manner the <HI>Brahmans</HI> are by their Law oblig'd to behave themselves, though many of them give themselves more liberty.

<P>One <HI>Draupeti,</HI> who in her life-time was a very religious Woman, was withal affectionately loving to her Husband, being never displeas'd at him, although he had spent his whole Estate, and so weakned his Body, that he was no longer able to visit his Strumpets, yet his inclinations were still such, that he declar'd he could not live, unless he might see his Mistresses: whereupon <HI>Draupeti</HI> out of extraordinary affection, taking him one Night on her Shoulders, carry'd him to his Con∣cubines; but going along in the Dark, she una∣wares ran against a Stake, on which a holy Man nam'd <HI>Galowa</HI> sat, and hit him with such force, that she overturn'd and hurt him; whereupon he cry'd, <HI>He that did me this Injury, let him die before the Sun rises;</HI> which <HI>Draupeti</HI> hearing, and pitying her Husband, said, <HI>Then let not the Sun rise;</HI> and so it hapned, the Sun not rising for several years af∣ter: Hereupon the People pray'd to <HI>Indre</HI> and <HI>De∣weta,</HI> to permit the Sun to rise; but they either could or would: not grant their Request: Then they address'd themselves to <HI>Bramma,</HI> who with the <HI>Deweta's</HI> went to the fore-mention'd Woman, saying, <HI>What will you have, and we will satisfie you, that the Sun may rise;</HI> whereto she reply'd, <HI>The Sun may rise, but I desire my Husband;</HI> which last word <HI>Husband</HI> she repeated five times; whereupon they answer'd, <HI>This shall be done in the other Life;</HI> then she immediately dy'd, and the Sun arose the next day as before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Liverty given to Women.</NOTE>A Woman may Dress her self when her Hus∣band is from home, or be merry during his ab∣sence; but she must die with her Husband, or presently after; and in confirmation of this some <HI>Brahmans</HI> maintain, that the Women ought to hold their Husbands in so great esteem, that they must be the first thing in their thoughts, and spend their whole time in studying how to oblige them, tel∣ling them, that though they spend their time with∣out one thought of God, yet it is no sin, especially if they will die with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Brahman</HI>'s Funeral.</NOTE>When a <HI>Brahman</HI> is dead, and his Body brought to the place where it is to be burnt, they wash their Hands, and lay each a little Rice on the Deceased's Mouth; which done, they wash their Hands a second time; then a <HI>Beteani</HI> (which is a <HI>Perrea,</HI> one of those which beat on small Drums when a Corps is to be burn'd) goes thrice about the Body, which is laid on a Pyle of Wood, and afterwards makes an Oration to the People after his manner, speaking earnestly in the Name of the Deceased, alledging, that he Governs over all, young and old, rich and poor; and that those which do good in their life-time, shall be requi∣ted after their Death; and those that do ill, shall meet with the same. But all the Bodies of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> are not burnt, but some are bury'd. Likewise the Bodies of the <HI>Wistnowa's</HI> and <HI>Smar∣ta's</HI> are always burnt; but those of the <HI>Seivia's</HI> and <HI>Sanjasies</HI> are bury'd. The two first give this Reason for the burning of their Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> be∣cause the Fire purifies the Souls from sin, for those that have serv'd <HI>Wistnow</HI> never so faithfully, are not wholly free from sin, and therefore must on necessity be purifi'd by Fire.</P>
<P>The Defunct, whether those which are to be bury'd or burnt, are in some places clad in rich Ap∣parel, as if living, and sitting in a Sedan, and so carry'd to the place of Interment, the Sedan be∣ing open before, that the Corps may be seen; behind follow several Persons carrying Vessels of Oyl, which are to be thrown into the Fire with the Body.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Woman may not Mar∣ry after her Husbands Death.</NOTE>A Woman is not permitted to Marry after her Husbands Death, but the Man may; neither will any Marry her, because she would be ac∣counted Dishonest to have had two Husbands.</P>
<P>These severe and strict Laws prove very preju∣dicial to young Widows, who being cautious to preserve their Reputation by continuing single, do privately prostitute themselves to People of ano∣ther Religion, or to any else; others on the con∣trary abhorring so wicked a Life suffer themselves to be burnt with their Husbands dead Body, which is done after this manner:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How she is burnt with his Corps.</NOTE>As soon as the Breath is departed out of the Man's Body, if his Wife hath resolv'd to follow him at his death, they immediately make ready all Necessaries thereto belonging: for then the Woman cannot go back from her word, of recall her promise: if she be a <HI>Brahmans</HI> Wife, she is carry'd to the Funeral Pyle in a handsom Sedan under a Canopy, accompany'd by all her Friends, who encourage and extol her resolution, present her with <HI>Betel,</HI> and delight her Ears with the noise of Cymbals and Drums. The <HI>Settrea's</HI> and <HI>Sou∣dra's</HI> mix their <HI>Betel</HI> which they give to the Wo∣man with a certain Powder, which takes away all apprehensions of fear, and makes them courage∣ous and bold; but this is never done by the <HI>Brah∣mans,</HI> they being not permited to force, perswade, or use any means to a Woman, to gain her con∣sent to be burn'd. If she be of the Family of the <HI>Settrea's</HI> or <HI>Soudra's,</HI> then she carries a Lemmon in one Hand, and a Looking-glass in the other; but if of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> or <HI>Weinsja's</HI> Tribe, onely a few red Flowers, such as they strew in the <HI>Pagodes</HI> on their Idols, and have already been Offer'd to them. Coming to the place where her Husband is to be burn'd, she first go's to a Pool of Water to wash her self, giving away her Jewels, if she hath any; after which a <HI>Brahman</HI> says a Prayer; this done, and the Woman having put on a yellow Garment, she goes with great joy to the place from whence she is to leap into the Fire, which is made of glowing Coals in a deep Pit; and that she may not be terrifi'd with the sight of the Fire, they put Mats quite round to prevent her looking into it.</P>
<P>At the side of the Pit is a little rising Ascent made, on which she sits down against the Mats, and takes leave of her Relations and Friends, who still encourage her Undertaking. Lastly, having thus taken her leave, she throws a <HI>Pilang</HI> or Pestle, with which she us'd to stamp Rice, a small Rice∣pot, and the like Kitchin Utensils, over the Mat into the Fire, poures also a Pot of Oyl over her Head and Body; whereupon the mat being ta∣ken away, she suddenly leaps with the Pot of Oyl into the Fire; round about which stand divers People with great pieces of Wood in their Hands, which they throw upon her as soon as she is in the Fire, and cover her therewith above a Man's heighth.</P>
<P>Thus the Women of the <HI>Settrean, Weinsja's</HI> and <HI>Soudrean</HI> Tribes come to their ends; but those of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> endure far greater pain, <HI>viz.</HI> they leap not into the Fire, but are laid on a Pyle of Wood by their dead Husbands, as if they were to sleep by them; then they lay over them a great heap, leaving onely their Heads bare, on which they pour Oyl, and other such combustible stuff.</P>
<P>It is a great wonder, how the Women can be perswaded to this horrible Death, and brought to make a promise thereof; but this is effected by the Delusions of the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> who not onely instance

</FIGURE> several Women for an Example, which have done the same, but also make them believe, that they do their Husbands an extraordinary kindness therein, freeing them from torments in the other World: Neither are the Women a little per∣swaded to it by their Husbands, because they live in derision and scorn of all People if they refuse: for they are not permitted to wear long Hair, but forc'd to shave it off; nor to eat <HI>Betel,</HI> wear Jew∣els, or Marry a second time; in short, she is sub∣ject to all manner of sorrows, and displeasures of of all People; so that Women of any courage do seldom refuse, and the rather, because they are be∣reav'd of all their Honor and Dignity, and their Goods taken from them; so that the Women lose all when their Husbands die, and if they live af∣ter them, they can expect nothing but sorrow and trouble.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Not allow'd amongst the <HI>Mahumetans</HI></NOTE>This Burning is not allow'd in those Coun∣treys which are under the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> unless the Governor of the Countrey gives consent thereto, who first examines the Person whether she be willing; which if he find, then he gives permis∣sion. Neither is this Custom at all observ'd ex∣cept amongst People of great Quality, who are more exact in preserving their Honor than other People: for Noblemens Wives account it a great testimony of their love and fidelity to their Husbands, to be burnt with their dead Bodies.</P>
<P>Others are carry'd on Horseback about the Towns in State, with a Lemmon in one Hand, and a Looking-glass in the other, in which they look as they ride, and in a mournful tone sing cer∣tain Elegies, whil'st many other Men and Wo∣men follow them on foot; over her Head they carry an <HI>Umbrella,</HI> after the Custom of the Coun∣trey; and before her walk several beating on Drums: In all their Passage they shew a pleasant and undaunted Countenance, not shedding one Tear, expressing more sorrow for the death of their Husbands than their own, and seeming more joyful to go to him in the other World, than sor∣ry to leave this. But some chuse to be burnt alive with him after this manner:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some bury'd alive.</NOTE>The Preparations for the burning and burying of Women after their Husbands Death are one and the same, the difference onely consisting in he Burning it self. After the Woman hath wash'd her self, she steps amongst the noise of Pipes, Drums, Cornets, and the like, to the Grave in which her Husband lies bury'd, where setting her self down on a Bank of Earth, she em∣braces her dead Husband; which done, they be∣gin to fill the Vault or Grave, throwing the Earth in; when the Earth begins to come up to her Chin, two of the attendant Officers hang a Cloth before the Mouth of the Grave, and give her a Cup full of Poyson, which immediately changes her Countenance, and suddenly after they break her Neck.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Alms and other. Works done for the benefit of the De∣ceased.</NOTE>The <HI>Heathens</HI> also believe that they are able to perform many works, which may extend to the benefit of the Deceased, and to that purpose they give Alms to those that request it of them, make <HI>Tampandals</HI> or Cisterns of Water near the High-ways, where Travellers may always have cold or warm Water, and sometimes <HI>Canje,</HI> which is Water boyl'd with Rice and Beans, <HI>gratis;</HI> which in all Cases is very beneficial to the living, and a very necessary Business in these Countreys; for by this means Travellers which are become faint through the exceeding heat of the Sun, are reviv'd and refresh'd. They also build Temples or <HI>Pagodes</HI> on the Graves of their deceased Friends, though they never worship any Images in the same, because they account those peaces unclean; and though there are Images in some of them, yet they are not set up to be worshipp'd as other Idols, but onely to represent the Person that lies bury'd there. They also make Wells and Ponds of Wa∣ter in the behalf of the Dead, which are com∣mon for all People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Outward signs of their Mourning.</NOTE>Their outward signs of Sorrow and Mourning are these: When the eldest Person of a Family
<PB N="123" REF="93"/>dies, all the Friends and Relations shave off their Beards, and chew no <HI>Betel</HI> in ten days, neither do they cat above once a day: But if a younger Per∣son dies, then those that are older, though his near Relations, never mourn: Wherefore the Men mourn not for their Wives, because they are al∣ways younger than themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Mourn∣ing.</NOTE>But the <HI>Soudra's</HI> mourn as well for young as old; and not onely shave off their Beards, but also the Hair of their Heads, leaving onely one Lock on the Crown, about which they tie a Cloth, not wearing their usual Cap in three days. They also abstain from <HI>Betel,</HI> though not so long as the <HI>Brah∣mans,</HI> but only three or four days. Upon the de∣cease of a Child the <HI>Soudra's</HI> shave not off the Hair of their Heads, but onely eat no <HI>Betel</HI> for three days.</P>
<P>When any one dies in a Noblemans House, all the Slaves must shave off their Beards, in sign of mourning. If a Husbandman dies out of the Fa∣mily <HI>Walala</HI> or <HI>Ambria,</HI> then twelve several sorts of People come and shew Reverence to the Dead: <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The <HI>Brahmans</HI> which serve the <HI>Pagodes.</HI> 2. The <HI>Bateani</HI> or <HI>Perrea's,</HI> which beat the Drums at Funerals. 3. The <HI>Pannejawa's,</HI> which play on long Cymbals. 4. The Smiths. 5. The Joyners. 6. The Goldsmiths. 7. The Laundrers. 8. The Barbers. 9. The <HI>Poumale Andi,</HI> which carry Flow∣ers to the Dead. 10. The <HI>Canacapule</HI> or Secreta∣ries. 11. The <HI>Salewadi.</HI> 12. The <HI>Caicullen</HI> or Dauncers, whose Wives are common Strumpets, as hath been mention'd before.</P>
<P>This Order in former times was very strictly observ'd but is of late not much regarded; for the <HI>Brahmans, Canacapule,</HI> and <HI>Andi,</HI> are grown to such a degree of Greatness, that they never go to shew Reverence, as do the other nine.</P>
<P>Every one that comes receives, as a Reward, a Cloth which they tie about their Heads, letting it hang down on their Backs; at the receipt where∣of they fall with their Faces on the ground, near a place where <HI>Nili,</HI> or unthresh'd Rice, is given out for Alms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of their Fu∣nerals.</NOTE>Before we conclude the manner of these <HI>Indian</HI> Funerals, it ought not to be omitted what <HI>Peter Delia Valle</HI> says concerning them; <HI>viz.</HI> That they keep not their dead Bodies above twenty four Hours in the House, but burn them with the fol∣lowing Ceremonies.</P>
<P>The Corps is laid naked on a Pile of Wood, made like a Bed, with the Face towards the near∣est Water; then they cover the Private Parts of the Corps with a piece of Wood taken from the Pile, rub the Hands and Feet of the Defunct with Oyl, and put a Cole into his Mouth. All things thus being ready, they kindle the said Cole, and then the Pile of Wood, first under the Deceased's Head, sprinkling Water round about the Pile, still laying up the Fire again as it falls down, and letting the Ashes of the Body remain in the same Place, and sometimes also the Bones, though but half burnt: The Relations and Friends of the Deceas'd in the mean time fill the Air with their Lamentations.</P>
<P>The Bodies of Noblemen, and those that are rich, are burnt with sweet-smelling Wood, as <HI>Sandal, Aguilla, Brava,</HI> and the like but those of mean Persons with ordinary Wood. Children under two years of age are not burnt, but buried.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The various Diet of their several Sects.</NOTE>The <HI>Settreaes</HI> and <HI>Soudraes</HI> eat Fish, Flesh, and whatever else is set before them, except Beef, from which all the four Chief Tribes, <HI>viz. Brah∣mans, Soudraes, Setteraes,</HI> and <HI>Weinsjaes</HI> abstain, insomuch that they would rather starve than kill a Cow, or eat of the Flesh.</P>
<P>The <HI>Boti,</HI> as also the <HI>Weinsjaes</HI> or <HI>Benjans,</HI> will not eat of any thing that ever had Life, and much less kill any Creature, believing they should com∣mit a great sin if they should so do. They also abstain from Herbs that are of a reddish tincture, reason of their resemblance in colour with Blood; for to shed Blood they account one of the greatest sins that can be committed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They kill no living Crea∣tures, but buy them to set at liberty.</NOTE>They often buy Birds, and other Creatures that are kept in Cages, with considerable Sums of Money; as also those that are taken by Hunts∣men, whether <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Christians,</HI> for no other end but to preserve them from death, and give them liberty. From this Custom, which is very com∣mon amongst them, hapned once a pleasant Quar∣rel, <HI>viz.</HI> A Christian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A pleasant, quarrel be∣tween a <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> and an <HI>Indian.</HI></NOTE> clad after the <HI>Indian</HI> fashi∣on, bought some Birds to eat of a Bird-catcher, who by his Garb taking him to be an <HI>Indian,</HI> open'd his Cage, as soon as he had receiv'd his Money, and let them flie; whereupon the <HI>Christi∣an</HI> contesting, would have the Birds deliver'd to him, or his Money; and in short, the Bird-catch∣er, though he lost his Birds, was forc'd to repay the <HI>Christian</HI> his Money in the presence of all the Spectators, to their no little laughter.</P>
<P>There is great deceit in this kind of dealing; For many poor People, of a contrary opinion, to make an advantage, take any live Bird, and bringing the same to sell amongst these <HI>Indians,</HI> cry like mad-men, <HI>I will kill it instantly, I will wring of its Neck:</HI> Whereupon the innocent <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> immediately come running, and buy it above its worth, onely to release it from death.</P>
<P>To this purpose they have Cages in many pla∣ces to keep lame or hurt Birds, and also for four∣footed Beasts, which with great care are cured and fed at the Publick Charge.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cages for Birds, like Hospitals.</NOTE>Not very far from <HI>Cambava</HI> are, according to <HI>Della Valle,</HI> divers such Cages; <HI>viz.</HI> one for wounded and sick Birds, another for sick or lame Beasts, as Goats, Rams, and Sheep; and another for great Cattel, as Cowes and Calves, of which there were a great number, some with broken Legs, others sick, old, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, which were put in there to be fatned and cur'd.</P>
<P>Amongst these foremention'd Beasts was also a poor Mahumetan, who for a Robbery which he had committed had both his Hands cut off; but was by these <HI>Indians</HI> put in amongst the Beasts to be cured and fed.</P>
<P><HI>Perusci</HI> also makes mention, out of <HI>Emanuel Pinner</HI>'s Letter, of such Places for Birds, in these words, <HI>There are several Hospitals for Birds in</HI> Cambaya, <HI>but none for Men or Women, whom they suffer to perish without any relief.</HI> In their own Ci∣ties they suffer no <HI>Indian</HI> to kill any manner of Beast: Wherefore strange Merchants run a great hazard in killing a Sheep, or any other Beast, pri∣vately in their Houses to eat; for if it should hap∣pen any way to be discover'd, it would undoubted∣ly cost them their Lives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great esteem they have for Cows.</NOTE>Amongst all Beasts, Cows are the most highly esteem'd; for they tip their Horns with Gold, and beset them with Precious Stones: Nay, they hold them in such Veneration, that when the <HI>In∣dians</HI> Trading with <HI>Christians,</HI> or any other Peo∣ple, are provok'd to swear, their onely Oath is, By the death of a Cow; <HI>viz.</HI> He that swears, having a Cow by him, and a Knife in his Hand.
<PB N="124" REF="94"/>says, that if he doth not speak the truth, and the business be otherwise than he affirms, he wishes that the Knife which he hath in his hand may kill the Cow.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Marriage of Bulls and Cows.</NOTE>These Heathens have another ridiculous and unheard of Custom about this Beast, especially in <HI>Surat; viz.</HI> they marry Bulls and Cows to∣gether publickly, with many Ceremonies, after this manner. The Beasts having a Rope tied about their Necks, are led to a River, where the Priest washeth their Heads. Then the Priest standing on the Shore, makes strange Signs to them with his Hands, whilst the Owners of the Beasts making a Fire of dry'd Cow-dung, set themselves round about it: Whereupon the Priest also drawing near the Fire, throws in Sandal-wood, Benjamin, and Aloes. Then going to the Water again, the Beasts are brought before him, and held so as that their fore-legs may stand on the Shore, and the hindermost in the Water; whilst the Priest taking off the old Ropes that a were about their Necks, puts on new. This done, they hold the Beasts Mouthes close together, while the Priest marks them with a yellow Stroke in the Forehead.</P>
<P>Mean while the Priest reads many strange Prayers out of a Book; which done, he throws several Perfumes into a Copper Pan full of glow∣ing Coals, with which he smokes the new-married Beasts under their Heads, Bellies, and Tails; then he goes again praying about the Fire, and at last perfumes the Tails of both, which are held toge∣ther.</P>
<P>If by chance the Beasts, during this Cere∣mony, happen to urine, the Women strive one with another to catch it, some with Pots, others with their Hands, and drink it; for they esteem this Water holy, and good for a barren Womb.</P>
<P>After this Marriage and Ceremonies are per∣form'd, the Beasts are led home again, accompa∣nied with a great number of Men, Women, and Children, who make a Feast. <HI>Texeira</HI> tells us, That a <HI>Benjan</HI> Merchant spent 12000 Ducats at the Marriage of his Cow with a Bull of his Neighbors.</P>
<P>Moreover, at some Seasons they have a Custom to feed their Cows with unthresh'd Rice; which done, they wash their Dung in a Sieve, and dry those Corns which are undigested, and remain in the Sieve; which Corns being afterwards conse∣crated by the Priest, are accounted holy, and being made into Cakes, and bak'd, are given to sick People for a wonderful Medicine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>In∣dians</HI> have Cows in great esteem.</NOTE>The <HI>Indians</HI> shew this great reverence to a Cow for three special Reasons. The first is, Be∣cause they believe, that the Souls of the Pious, which have liv'd justly, and such as God will not punish in this World, are transmigrated into these Beasts. Secondly, Because, with the <HI>Mahume∣tans,</HI> they believe, That the Foundation of the World is supported onely on the Horns of these Beasts, by them call'd <HI>Behemoth,</HI> which name they have taken out of <HI>Job;</HI> and that when the Cow moves any faster than ordinary, it occasions Earth∣quakes. Thirdly, When <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> being on a time highly incens'd by reason of the many sins which the People had committed, had resolv'd to destroy the World, a Cow appeasing him, ob∣tain'd Pardon for all their sins, and deliver'd the World from utter ruine.</P>
<P>Moreover, this their abstaining from Flesh, and from killing of Beasts, the <HI>Indians</HI> seem to have suck'd out of <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s Doctrine, if it was not customary amongst them before; for <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> after the same manner, and by reason he believ'd the Transmigration of Souls, forbade also his Scholars to eat Flesh.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> forbid the eating of Flesh, and why.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> also maintain, That the eating of Flesh is not to be allow'd, because it cannot be done without forcing the Soul from the Body, which they account a horrid sin. And as it is ac∣counted a sin to kill a Man or Woman, because thereby is occasion'd a separation of Soul and Bo∣dy; for the same reason, say they, it is sin to kill any Beast, since by the death thereof the Soul is separated from the Body, and necessitated to pass to another, whereby its condition is not made better, but worse; for the Soul which formerly resided in a Cow, might chance to be transmi∣grated into the Body of some despis'd Beast or Plant: For the <HI>Brahmans</HI> believe, That not onely the Souls of Men transmigrate into Beasts, but also into Trees and Herbs; and that Humane Creatures, Beasts, Trees, and Plants, have all one and the same Soul, and differ onely in the outward appearance of the Body.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sendra's</HI> and <HI>Settrea's</HI> condemn'd by the <HI>Brahmans</HI></NOTE>And for this reason the <HI>Brahmans</HI> condemn the <HI>Soudra's</HI> and <HI>Settrea's,</HI> declaring them guilty of unpardonable sins, because both these Tribes kill all manner of Beasts for their Food, except onely Cows, from which they all abstain.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Settrea's,</HI> on the contrary, affirm, That they do better than the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> who disturb many Souls, by plucking divers Herbs out of the Ground to feed one Person; when as they, by killing a Beast, disturb onely one, to feed many People. But the <HI>Brahmans</HI> answer, That they by the pulling of many Herbs out of the Ground, do not sin so much as the <HI>Settrea's</HI> by killing of one Goat; because the Souls which reside in Herbs are in the meanest condition, and by their transmigation remove into nobler Bodies, as Men or Beasts. Nevertheless, they pretend that they would, if it were possible, live without Food, so to prevent the disturbing of any Soul. Yet few amongst them are so exact, but freely eat of the Fruits, Herbs, Roots, and Plants which the Earth produces, judging they may do it without of∣fence: But they will never eat of any thing that had life, chusing rather to die of Hunger.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> are very moderate in their Diet, and have no peculiar Dainties; nor do they use to drink Wine, or any other strong Liquor; but their common Drink is clear Water, without any kind of mixture: yet sometimes, with great de∣light, they drink a Draught of Milk at Meals, with which to supply them most People of Note keep Cows.</P>
<P>Their usual Food is Rice, Plants, and Herbs, according to the Season of the Year. They ex∣tremely abhor Drunkenness and account it one of their five Mortal Sins.</P>
<P>Those amongst them who perform the mean∣est Offices, and do the greatest Lahor, have the most freedom allow'd them in their Diet, because they require the most Sustenance, which makes many of them not scruple to drink Wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans,</HI> out of a high esteem or self-conceit of themselves, will in no wise be perswa∣ded to eat or drink any thing in a House inhabited by one of another Tribe, but onely <HI>Teyer,</HI> that is, thick Milk; because they account that to be a sort of <HI>Amortam,</HI> or <HI>Nectar of the Gods:</HI> Nay, a <HI>Brahman</HI> will not eat in another <HI>Brahman's</HI> House
<PB N="125" REF="94"/>that is of a different Sect; and if a <HI>Byahman</HI> be Marry'd to a Woman of another Family, she is not allow'd to eat with, nor to see him eat; but if a Man out of love to his Wife, permit her to eat with him, and other <HI>Brahmans</HI> are informed there∣of, they will not onely resent it very ill, but shun the House of such a Person, and account him un∣worthy of their Society.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pride of the <HI>Pandite</HI> or <HI>Boten.</HI></NOTE>These Idolaters are very proud, for those of any Quality will, if possible, avoid to eat with any of a meaner Degree. There are some amongst the <HI>Brahmans</HI> call'd <HI>Pandite</HI> and <HI>Boten,</HI> who being highly esteem'd, will not eat in the House of a <HI>Brahman, Sinai, Naike,</HI> or any other Nobleman, because they eat Fish. These <HI>Sinai</HI> or <HI>Naike</HI> are vulgarly call'd <HI>Mazarens,</HI> and are of less esteem than the other, eat freely with a <HI>Pandite</HI> or <HI>Boti,</HI> and account it a great favor, and so with the other. Some are so vainly curious, that they will not eat in a place where another of a contrary Sect or Tribe hath Din'd or Supp'd before the Floor is rubb'd over with Ox-dung, which they believe cleanses it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> never eat with any of another Re∣ligion, nor will they drink out of one Cup with them, but shun their company; and, endeavor by all means possible to avoid touching of them, fear∣ing to be defil'd thereby; nay, an <HI>Indian</HI> of great Quality will not onely refuse to eat with another of a lower Degree, out will not be touch'd by him, and if he should accidentally, he would im∣mediately cleanse his Body, by rubbing it with Herbs.</P>
<P>The common People shew great reverence and obedience to their Nobility: for meeting them in the Street, they not onely give them the Way, but run from one side of the Street to the other like mad Men, for fear of touching them; nay, the Noblemen, if they did otherwise, would beat them into better manners.</P>
<P>In regard no <HI>Indian</HI> will drink with another of a different Opinion out of one and the same Cup, for fear of being defil'd, therefore when they are in the Field, and have but one Cup, with which they are forc'd to make shift, they have found out a means not to defile one another by drinking together, <HI>viz.</HI> they touch not the Cup with their Lips, but holding it with one Hand a pretty distance from their Mouths, pouring the Liquor therein very dexterously, not spilling a drop.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fast-days of the <HI>Brahmans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> are also very strict in keeping certain appointed Fast-days, <HI>viz.</HI> they Fast the eleventh day after the full Moon; and again eleven days after a new Moon, when they eat no kind of Food, not so much as <HI>Betel,</HI> for the space of twenty four hours, but spend that time in Read∣ing and Praying.</P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> the <HI>Brahmans</HI> of the Sect <HI>Seivia,</HI> as also the <HI>Soudra's,</HI> who are of the same Opinion with the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> and in some Observances as religious as they, Fast every <HI>Monday,</HI> and abstain from all manner of Food till the Stars arise.</P>
<P>They are generally not allow'd, during their time of Fasting, to undertake any manner of Bu∣siness, though of never so small a Concern. Some of them Fast eight, others fifteen, twenty, and thirty days, contenting themselves with very lit∣tle Sustenance, and a draught of Water.</P>
<P><HI>Perushi</HI> relates, that a certain penitent Person by long Fasting lost his left Eye, which flew out of his Head.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fast <HI>Dauli.</HI></NOTE>They have also a Fast of nine days call'd <HI>Dauli</HI> or <HI>Davili,</HI> during which whole time the <HI>Sammi,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>The Giogi,</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Party,</HI> utterly abstain from Meat and Drink, sitting all that time on one place in a <HI>Pagode,</HI> fearing if they should stir, to provoke an appetite; notwithstanding they do this freely, and without any Obligation.</P>
<P>Commonly in the last Evening of the Fast, a great number of Singers go with the noise of little Bells and other Instruments to the <HI>Pagods,</HI> just as if they were going to a Funeral, where finding the afroesaid <HI>Giogi</HI> sitting on Carpets on the Ground, they place themselves round them in a Circle, and having spent a considerable time in Sing∣ing and jingling their Bells, one of the <HI>Sammi</HI> gives each of them out of a Dish two or three Kernels of Pomegranate with several little pieces of Quin∣ces; after this he plucks several Ears of Corn, which is planted near the place where they sit, whil'st the Singers fill the Air with their Voices, and the jingling noise of their Bells and other In∣struments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sammi</HI> relate, that this Corn which they cut was Sow'n with their own Hands in the be∣ginning of their Fasting, and that they had every day since water'd and bless'd the same with all their usual Ceremonies.</P>
<P>On the last Evening of their Fast they begin gain to eat a little, so to bring their Stomachs by degrees to its usual appetite, fearing that if they should eat too much at first, they might prejudice their Healths, and endanger their Lives.</P>
<P>We might justly suspect, the truth of this their long Fasting, did not very credible Eye-witnesses confirm the same.</P>
<P>All the Moneth of <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Brahmans</HI> eat a Pap made of Rice, Sugar, and some Fruit mixt together.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diet of the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE>As to what concerns the Meat and Drink of the <HI>Indians,</HI> it is several, according to the Situa∣tion of the Countrey, but most <HI>Indians</HI> use boyl'd Rice in stead of Bread. The <HI>Coco</HI>-tree is the chief and onely thing of their subsistence: for it affords Fruit, Oyl, Milk, Honey, Vinegar, and Wine. The greatest Delicacy amongst the common Peo∣ple, is Rice boyl'd with green Ginger, and mix'd with a little Pepper and Butter. Their ordinary Food is of wheaten Flowr, but of a certain course Grain, though well tasted, which they make up into great round and thick Cakes, and bake them on thin Iron Plates, which they carry with them from one place to another when they travel; they spread a little Butter on these Cakes, and so eat them.</P>
<P>They have also a certain Dish call'd <HI>Massack,</HI> or <HI>Matsack,</HI> which is made of two parts Water, and one of Brandy, some Eggs, beaten Cinamon, Su∣gar, and Bread, which is boyl'd like a Posset.</P>
<P><HI>Baril</HI> is a Broth which the <HI>Indians</HI> make of the Juice or Milk of <HI>Coco-nuts</HI> and Butter, with all manner of Spices, and amongst others, Carda∣mom, Ginger, Herbs, Fruit, and several other Ingredients. The <HI>Christians,</HI> especially the <HI>Por∣tuguese,</HI> adde to the same the Flesh of Hens and Chickens chopt in small pieces, which they lay upon the Rice, that is boyl'd onely with Water and Salt.</P>
<P>They also boyl the Root <HI>Curcuma</HI> with their Meat and almost throughout all <HI>India</HI> they boyl no Meat without a little Bundle of Cammels Hay, in <HI>Greek</HI> call'd <HI>Schoenanthos,</HI> to give it a savory taste, and to fortifie the Stomach, as also a quan∣tity
<PB N="126" REF="95"/>of <HI>Calamus Aromaticus,</HI> or <HI>Nard,</HI> in the <HI>Malaian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Diringo.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> in many places have also a delicate Dish, or rather Sawce, to procure an Appetite, which is call'd <HI>Achor</HI> or <HI>Astjar,</HI> and is us'd there af∣ter the same manner as here our Gurkins, Olives, and Capers; it is likewise brought from thence into <HI>Europe,</HI> where many People eat it with much delight, it being made of Cucumbers, <HI>Mangos</HI> or long Pepper, Garlick, green Ginger Roots, and the young juicy Sprigs of Canes, which are laid in Pickle with Vinegar, Pepper and other Spices. The Bunches of green Pepper are also laid in Pickle, and brought to the Table either with roast or boyl'd Meat as likewise the Roots of green Ginger and <HI>Galanse,</HI> besides the Fruit <HI>Manga, Carambolas, Astjae, Billinbing, Curcuma;</HI> likewise Gurkins, Melons, and Pumpions in stead of Capers and Olives, which in <HI>Zurratte</HI> and other places, are also in great abundance.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Indians</HI> also eat that kind of Apple, call'd in <HI>Latine Pomum Amoris,</HI> and <HI>Pomum Aureum,</HI> and by the <HI>Portuguese, Pomod' Oro,</HI> which is a sort of <HI>Mandragora,</HI> or Mandrake cold in the third degree; though some put <HI>Achay,</HI> or <HI>Brasilian</HI> Pepper, in the <HI>Malaian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Lada Chili,</HI> that is, <HI>Pepper from Chili,</HI> which is very hot, to temper the ex∣traordinary Cold thereof, and pouring Oyl and Vinegar over them, eat the same with roasted Flesh or Fish. Some accustom themselves to chew <HI>Achay</HI> just as some People chew Tobacco. These golden Apples are sometimes Preserv'd with Su∣gar; but the <HI>Chineses</HI> on the Island <HI>Java,</HI> roasting them in Ashes, eat them with Pepper and Vine∣gar. The Fruits <HI>Carambolas</HI> are also for the same purpose laid in Pickle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their several sorts of Li∣quor.</NOTE>The Drink which is commonly drunk by the Vulgar, is Water; but People of note, especi∣ally <HI>Moors,</HI> mix Cinamon Juice and Sugar with their Water, which being a pleasant Liquor, is call'd <HI>Scherbet.</HI></P>
<P>In many places they drink in stead of Wine, a Liquor which is tapt out of the Palm-tree, into a Pot which hangs at it a whole Night. The <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> call this Wine <HI>Vinho de Palma,</HI> that is, <HI>Palm-wine;</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Cambaya, Tari</HI> or <HI>Ter∣ri;</HI> others, <HI>Sura</HI> and <HI>Toddy;</HI> and the <HI>Amboynans, Towack.</HI> This Liquor is of a white colour, and somewhat thick, and of a tart, yet pleasant taste, intoxicating the Brain like Wine, if drank to ex∣cess, but if moderately, it is accounted an excel∣lent Medicine against the Dropsie. They gene∣rally tap this Liquor out of the Tree after Sun-set, letting their Vessels hang to the same till Sun-rising, for then it keeps sweet and pleasant all the day after: for that which is tapt in the day-time is not so delightful to the Palate, but is flat and eager; which is occasion'd by the heat of the Sun, and is good for nothing but to make Vinegar, for which it is us'd by the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Liquor <HI>Tara</HI> or <HI>Terri,</HI> which of it self drops out of the Trees, they make another sort of Wine, by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Uraca,</HI> which is the onely Wine of all <HI>India,</HI> and being of a white co∣lour, is very hot and strong, which the <HI>Indians</HI> ne∣vertheless drink like Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> temper this Wine, by putting ston'd Raisins into the Vessel, which they do not stop close, but leave the Bung-hole open, least by reason of the extraordinary heat and strength the Fat should flie asunder, because it ferments like boyling Water. Every day for a fortnight toge∣ther they stir this Liquor, after which it becomes of a deep Red, and is of a sweetish taste. They also drink abundance of the fresh Juice, which is inclos'd within the <HI>Coco</HI>-nuts.</P>
<P>Another sort of Liquor call'd <HI>Zaguer,</HI> brought from <HI>Banda</HI> and the <HI>Molucko</HI> Isles, which drops out of a Tree not unlike the <HI>Coco.</HI> But this Liquor is very unwholsom to drink, especially for Stran∣gers, for it not onely occasions a great Loosness, but also a kind of dead Palsie, call'd by the <HI>Indi∣ans, Beribery.</HI></P>
<P>They have likewise a very strong Liquor like Brandy, call'd <HI>Arack,</HI> made of the Moisture that is inclos'd in the <HI>Coco</HI>-nuts, and also of that which drops out of the Tree it self, which they burn with Rice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> to make the most of their Rice, adulterate the same, by putting into it a sort of poisonous Weed, which drives upon the Sea, whereby the <HI>Arack</HI> receives a corroding Heat, very prejudicial to the Lungs, and causing Con∣sumption, vomiting of Blood, and other deadly Distempers, especially to all Strangers that drink thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> in many places have a Liquor which they make of Spring-water, <HI>Javansagar, Tamarinds,</HI> and Lemmons, which they put all to∣gether in a Vessel hoop'd with Iron Hoops, and stopping it very close, let it stand twenty four hours in the Sun, whereby throwing the Dross and Filth upwards, it becomes a most excellent Liquor, almost like <HI>March</HI> Beer.</P>
<P>Moreover, in most places of <HI>India</HI> a certain Li∣quor is made call'd <HI>Palipuntz,</HI> which by some is made after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> they take half Bran∣dy and half Water, into which they put Nut∣megs, Cinamon, Sugar, and Line Juice.</P>
<P>This Liquor, by the <HI>English</HI> call'd <HI>Punch,</HI> is ve∣ry hurtful to <HI>European</HI> Bodies, if drank excessively, for it occasions Loosness.</P>
<P>Some also drink a Brewage made onely of clear Water and brown Sugar, which if drunk in hot Weather is very unwholsome, but is much tem∣per'd, if a Draught of the Liquor <HI>Palipuntz</HI> be ta∣ken after it.</P>
<P>Moreover, they distill a kind of Brandy out of Dates, Sugar, and Palm-wine.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality in the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Countrey drink <HI>Chirassan</HI> Wine, for they have no Wine of their own, there being no Vines planted in all <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They take strong To∣bacco. and chew <HI>Betel.</HI></NOTE>Most of the <HI>Indians</HI> take very strong Tobacco, but after a peculiar manner, agreeing most with the <HI>Persians.</HI></P>
<P>All <HI>Indians</HI> likewise, as well <HI>Moors</HI> as <HI>Pagans,</HI> constantly chew the <HI>Betel</HI> Leaf with <HI>Areca</HI> and a little Chalk, or Ashes of burnt Oyster-shells.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Have good skill in Herbs</NOTE>The <HI>Pagan Indians,</HI> especially those of <HI>Zuratte</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> have extraordinary understanding in the nature of Herbs, knowing how to distinguish the good from the bad: for as these People, according to the <HI>Pythagorean</HI> man∣ner, do not eat of any thing that hath Life, but onely Roots and Herbs, so they know by daily ex∣perience how to distinguish the eatable Herbs from the medicinal or venomous.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> never use any Table-cloths, but in stead thereof lay a great Leaf of the Tree <HI>Mauz,</HI> which also serves them for Dishes and Trenchers; neither do they use Spoons, but wholly make use of their Hands and Fingers.</P>
<P>They commonly wear Jewels and Pendants in
<PB N="127" REF="95"/>both Ears, especially all the Idolaters, who also highly esteem all Strangers or <HI>Christians</HI> that wear them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Appa∣rel.</NOTE>The Apparel of the <HI>Indians</HI> is for the most part of Cotton or Callico, either fine or course, ac∣cording to every ones Quality: for Linnen they wear none, because <HI>India</HI> produces no Flax. These Clothes are put on over their bare Skins, and from the Middle upwards serve at once for Vest and Shirt, being very narrow at top, wide at bot∣tom, and reaching down to their Knees. From the Middle downwards they wear a pair of Draw∣ers of the same Stuff, which reaching below their Legs, touches their Feet.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Indian</HI> Women, who for the most part are swarthy, and have long Legs, but short Bo∣dies, go barefoot both at home and abroad. Women of Quality have commonly great <HI>Um∣brella's</HI> carry'd over their Heads to keep off the Sun.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Men, some go bare∣foot; others that are of higher Degree, either wear Slippers or Sandals; but in most places they go barefoot: Their Sandals are very easie, be∣cause of the extraordinary Heat of the Coun∣trey. They wear likewise, according to the Cu∣stom of their Predecessors, very long Hair, quite contrary to the manner of the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> who shave it all off, as also the lower part of their Beards. On their Heads they wear a fine <HI>Turbant,</HI> flat on the top, and almost square. The whitest People generally wear a <HI>Turbant</HI> whipt with di∣vers colour'd Ribbons upon a white Ground, and sometimes also Gold. Their Girdles are of white Cotton; but the richer sort have silken ones, stitch'd with Gold. They ride on Horseback with a Simitar by their Sides, a Shield about their Necks, and a little broad Dagger sticking at their Girdle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They anoint their Bodies.</NOTE>The <HI>Indians,</HI> both Men and Women, anoint their Bodies against the heat of the Sun, as also to make their Joynts nimble and pliable. This Ointment is made by the Women of all the sorts of <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood pulveris'd, the Leaves of <HI>Chan∣pock,</HI> the Flowers <HI>Mogori,</HI> of each a handful, Cam∣phire, so much as will give it a scent; all these In∣gredients being ground like Colours, are mix'd with Oyl of <HI>Coco</HI>-nuts or Roses, which is brought thither from <HI>Persia,</HI> and made thick like Paste; and though these People look very strangely with this Ointment, as if colour'd with Saffron, yet the smell thereof is very pleasant. For the same pur∣pose also they make another Ointment of the Flowers of a certain Tree, which is not very high, and hath Leaves like a Peach-Tree; both Leaves and Flowers are by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Sam∣paga,</HI> otherwise <HI>Champacka</HI> and <HI>Champe,</HI> which are of great esteem amongst them: for the <HI>Indians,</HI> especially the <HI>Moors,</HI> are extraordinary lovers of sweet and pleasant Smells, and chiefly those of Flowers; wherefore there are scarce any Women that walk along the Streets, but wear those or the like Flowers in their Hair, to render them the more acceptable to their Husbands or Suitors.</P>
<P>Through all <HI>India</HI> are likewise highly esteem'd the Leaves of a Tree, by the <HI>Arabians</HI> call'd <HI>Al∣canna,</HI> of which we have spoken before at large.</P>
<P>Moreover in the hot Seasons Persons of Qua∣lity, whether lying on their Floors or sitting, have several Servants stand by them, who continually fan them with Leather Fans, with which they not onely cool them, but also keep off the Flies, whil'st they cause their Barbers to rub their Backs, Shoulders, and other parts of their Bodies, so to cause the motion of the Blood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Places of Recreation.</NOTE>Their places of Recreation consist in Woods and Orchards, in which grow many pleasant Fruit-trees, as also in their Gardens; wherein, a∣mongst other Plants, grow small Vines, which bear extraordinary sweet and delicious Grapes, which they eat green or dry'd: for Wine they make none, because most People by their Law dare not drink any. There are also many Pome∣granate-trees, besides divers other excellent Flowers. In the middle of their Gardens are livers Springs or Fountains, which are considera∣bly rais'd above the Ground. From these Springs the Water is convey'd through narrow open Channels (for they know not the use of Leaden Pipes) to all parts of the Garden in the droughty Season of the Year. Moreover, there are round Cisterns to Bathe in, rais'd up and pav'd with Free-stone, and cover'd with fine Plaister.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Furni∣ture of their Houses very mean.</NOTE>In their Houses they have neither Stools, Ta∣bles, Beds, or Bedsteads: for all their Orna∣ments consist in the Floors, which are made very even of fine Earth or Plaister, on which they lay rich Carpets, as well in their Houses as in their Tents, laying a worse Cloth underneath to pre∣serve the other: On these they sit both when they eat and drink, after the Eastern manner, with their Legs across under them, and without their Sandals, which are left off partly for neatness, and partly to keep their Feet cool. They also sleep in the Night on these Carpets, or else on a hard Quilt or Hammock, call'd <HI>Cot;</HI> but whereever they lay themselves to sleep, they stretch them∣selves out to their full length, and for the most part lie on their Backs, without either Pillow or Bolster under their Heads. The common People sleep on the Floor in the dry Season of the Year, covering themselves from Head to Foot with a white Cotton Cloth, so that they appear like dead Bodies laid out. The Hammocks or <HI>Cots</HI> hang by two Ropes a little above the Floor, which be∣ing made fast at four corners, are by the Servants mov'd to and again to rock them asleep.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They go al∣ways Arm'd.</NOTE>The <HI>Indian Pagans,</HI> as well as <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> go al∣ways Arm'd, whether walking in the City, or way travelling, with a Sword, Shield, Bowe and Ar∣rows; nay, perform all manner of Offices, though in their own Houses, thus Arm'd, never leaving their Armor off but when they go to sleep.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Persons of Quality live.</NOTE>Persons of Quality live after a noble manner, and when they are either in a Coach or on Horse∣back, cause a Taffaty Flag to be carry'd before them. The priviledge of the Inhabitants here is very great in this point: for not onely great Per∣sons, but also every private Man, of what Coun∣trey or Religion soever, may live at as high a rate as he pleases, and imitate the King in his Fashi∣ons if he fancy, them, and his Estate be able to maintain it. Every one that is able keeps a great number of Servants, wherefore most of them live like Lords; which they may easily maintain, partly because the King, notwithstanding he sees his Subjects richly Cloth'd, and that they live with a great Retinue like Princes which have great Revenues, yet he lets them live in quiet, and undisturb'd, never taking any thing from them, though it justly belongs to him, because the <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally inclin'd thereto: for by rea∣son of the abundance of mean People and cheap∣ness of Provisions they may live nobly for a small
<PB N="128" REF="96"/>matter, allowing a Servant not above three <HI>Ro∣pia's</HI> a Moneth (each <HI>Ropias</HI> being 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. Sterl.</HI>) to buy him Provisions and Clothes with. There are likewise an innumerable company of Slaves, which cost little or nothing the keeping: for they wear nothing but a white Cotton Coat, which is very cheap, and eat little else but Rice and Fish, a very common Food in this Countrey, so that with small charge they can keep a great Family, and the rather, because the Commodities and Goods which are made by the Inhabitants are many, and the increase of their Land, by reason of its extraordinary fruitfulness, almost incre∣dible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women good Dan∣cers.</NOTE>The Women are very expert in Dancing to the sound of divers Bells, and other such like In∣struments, on which the Men play.</P>
<P>In <HI>Zuratte</HI> and divers other places in <HI>India,</HI> are several Women-Dancers, who are hir'd to Dance for Money, having Rings about their Legs, Strings of Pearl about their Necks, and many other rich Ornaments. Some also wear Breast-plates of Leather, almost round like a Shield, beset with Precious Stones, and the like, which glitter ex∣ceedingly in the Sun.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chans</HI> and other Nobles cause the fore∣mention'd Dancers to Dance before them after Meals, either to their own Voices, or to the sound of a Cymbal and <HI>Tumbeck,</HI> which is a kind of Tabor, and two small Drums.</P>
<P>These People go stark naked from one City to another, nay, through the whole Countrey, and sometimes to the Borders of other Countreys, and maintain themselves onely by Dancing and Singing. They wear gilded Rings on their Fin∣gers. Toes, and in their Noses, and each of them five gilded Copper Rings, and two red Silk Arm∣lets, with Gold Buttons below their Elbows on their Arms. After the same manner they adorn their Legs also.</P>
<P>These Women, besides their Dancing, prosti∣tute themselves to all those who desire them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Games and Pastimes.</NOTE>The <HI>Indians,</HI> especially the <HI>Mogolleans,</HI> spend much of their time in Hawking, and for that pur∣pose keep several sorts of great and small Hawks. Their Dogs with which they Hunt are (as <HI>Terry</HI> tells us) like our Greyhounds, though much smal∣ler; but <HI>Peruschi</HI> affirms, that they have no Hun∣ting Dogs, but make Leopards and Tygers tame, and teach them to Hunt, and at one Leap to seize and kill the Game: They also carry Guns with them when they go a Hunting, and kill their Game with a single Bullet, for smaller Shot they have none. They are very expert in Shooting with a Bowe and Arrow; their Bowes are made of Buffalo's Horns, and their Arrows of Canes, with which they shoot Birds flying, and Beasts as they run at full speed.</P>
<P>The wild Fowl which keep in the Water they catch after a subtil manner, <HI>viz.</HI> a Man going into he Water with an artificial Bird of the same kind which he designs to take, imitates its Voice, whil'st he swims under Water in such a manner, that the artificial Bird being on the Crown of his Head, appears just above the Water, by which means coming near the Birds, he pulls them down by the Legs, and takes as many of them as he pleases.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Pastime within their Houses, they have Cards, though differing from ours in the Pictures, and in the number; they also are expert in playing at Draughts. They delight very much in the company of Quacks, Juglers, and the like, the Quacks carrying poysonous Ser∣pents in Baskets, and suffering themselves to be bitten or stung by them at their pleasures; the stung part swelling, they immediately cure the same with Oyl and certain Powders which they lay thereupon, afterwards proffering to sell the same Medicaments to the Spectators.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juglers.</NOTE> Their Juglers also are very dexterous in their Art, and do strange things by the sleight of Hand, <HI>viz.</HI> they set Dishes or wide open Baskets on the Ground, three or four one above another, which seem to be all em∣pty as they set them down, but in the taking them up one after another there seems to be living Birds in them, either Turtle-doves or others, which they seemingly cover again with the same Dishes, turning them backwards and forwards, as if they took them away, the Birds being afterwards no more to be seen, the Spectators not being able to discern either how they are brought thither, or ta∣ken away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Hun∣ting.</NOTE>The <HI>Great Mogol</HI> often goes a Hunting with a thousand, sometimes two thousand Men.</P>
<P>About <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Dely,</HI> along the Stream <HI>Gemna,</HI> as far as the Mountains, as also on each side of the High-way, which runs to <HI>Lahor,</HI> is a large quantity of untill'd Land; some parts are wooddy, others overgrown with Grass of a Man's heighth. In all these places are many Game-keepers, who go from place to place, to prevent Hunting or Hawking there, except for Partridges, Quails, and Hares, which the <HI>Indians</HI> catch in Gins or Snares; so that there are abundance of wild Beasts in all places. When these Keepers of the Game know that the King or <HI>Mogol</HI> is in the Field a Hunting, and near their Station they acquaint the chief Master Huntsman with the quality of the Beast which is Hunted, and where there are most of them; whereupon all the Avenues to that place are guarded, that Travellers may not go through that place, but pass by on one side or other. They Hunt several Beasts, as <HI>Gazelles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Beasts they chiefly Hunt.</NOTE> <HI>Nil∣gaux,</HI> or grey Oxen, Lyons, Cranes, and others. They Hunt <HI>Gazelles</HI> with tame Leopards after this manner: When they discover a Herd of <HI>Gazelles</HI> (for they commonly graze five or six in a compa∣ny) they unchain the Leopard, that lay Chain'd in a little Wagon where they are kept; he being let loose, doth not immediately run at them, but goes creeping along to hide himself, till the <HI>Gazel∣les</HI> passing by, he leaps with incredible swiftness upon them, and seizing one of them, strangles the same, satisfying himself by onely sucking the Blood, and tearing out the Heart and Liver; but if he misses his prey, which often happens, then he stands still, very well knowing it to be in vain to run after them, because they are much swifter than himself: When the Game is ended, the Keeper approaches by Degrees, stroaks the Leo∣pard, and throwing the Flesh to him, blinds his Eyes, putting on his Chain, and so conveys him into the Wagon again.</P>
<P>The catching of the <HI>Nilgaux,</HI> or grey Oxen, which are a kind of Buffalo's, is of no great diffi∣culty: for they surround them with a strong Net, which they close by degrees, and having brought them into a narrow compass, the King, with his <HI>Omrahs</HI> and Husbandmen stepping in, kill them as they please, either by throwing Darts at them, or with Bullets, Arrows, and Swords, and in such great numbers, that the King sends whole Quar∣ters thereof for Presents to his <HI>Omrahs.</HI></P>
<PB N="129" REF="96"/>
<P>In their catching of Cranes it is very pleasant, to see how these Fowls defend themselves against the Birds of prey, whom sometimes they kill, but very often get from them, because the Hawks or Falcons are not so nimble as they in turning and winding.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of Hunting the Lyon by the <HI>Great Mogol.</HI></NOTE>But of all their Hunting, that of the Lyon is not onely the most Royal (for none but the King and Princes may perform the same without spe∣cial permission) but also the most dangerous, and is perform'd after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> When the King is in the Field, and the Keepers thereof have discover'd the place where the Lyon keeps, they tie an Ass to a Tree near the same; the Lyon coming out and devouring the Ass, goes after∣wards unmolested to seek for some other prey, ei∣ther of Oxen, Sheep, or whatsoever he can light on; then going to drink, he comes back to his old place, and there rests till the next day; when co∣ming forth again, he finds another Ass in the same place, ty'd there by the Keepers; having fed him thus for several days together, at last, the day be∣fore the King is to come to Hunt, they tie another Ass in the same place, having first given it abun∣dance of <HI>Opium,</HI> that the Flesh thereof may make the Lyon sleep the better; then calling in all the Rusticks thereabouts, they inclose the Lyon within strong Nets made for that purpose, bring∣ing the same by degrees to a small circumference, as they do in catching the <HI>Nilgaux;</HI> this done, and all things in readiness, the King mounts on an Elephant, Arm'd with Iron Plates, in company of the chief Master Huntsman and some <HI>Omrahs,</HI> all likewise mounted on Elephants, several <HI>Gourze∣berdars,</HI> and many other Huntsmen on foot, Arm'd with Half-pikes and Musquets; in which manner approaching the Net, they fire at the Lyon, who when he feels himself wounded, comes directly, according to the custom, to one of the Elephants, but finds himself intangled in the Net, where the King shoots at him so long till he hath kill'd him. But some Lyons have often been known to leap over the Net, to the destruction of many People. The <HI>Indians</HI> account it a good Omen when the King kills a Lyon, and a very bad one when he misses him, believing the whole State to be in danger if he doth not destroy him. They also use great Ceremony at the end of this Hunting: for the dead Lyon is brought before the King in pre∣sence of all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> who after they have ex∣actly view'd and measur'd it, give an account thereof to the Secretary to Register the same, <HI>viz.</HI> That such a King, at such a time, kill'd a Lyon of such a bigness, and such colour'd Hair, and having Teeth and Claws of such a length, and all other Circumstances whatever.</P>
<P>In <HI>India</HI> they use no Torches or Links, as we do here, but Copper Fire-pans, almost like those which in several Paintings are seen held by infer∣nal Furies. In these Pans they feed the Fire with Pitch, and the like, which makes a great Flame. A Servant commonly carries this Fire-pan in a Copper Case, with a very long and narrow Neck in stead of a Handle, by which he holds the same, and still feeds the Flame With fresh Matter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indians</HI> manner of Writing.</NOTE>Most <HI>Indians,</HI> especially the <HI>Malabars,</HI> use in stead of Paper, to write on the long Leaves of the <HI>Coco</HI>-tree, on which they neatly cut their Letters with an Iron Instrument.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Lan∣guage.</NOTE>As to what concerns the Language of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> it onely differs in general from the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> but they have also several different Dialects amongst themselves. Amongst all their Languages, there is none which spreads it self more than the <HI>Malayan</HI> (as shall be declar'd more at large,) and therefore it will not be amiss in this place to render into <HI>English</HI> some of their chiefest words.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Speech the same, but the Character different.</NOTE>According to <HI>Della Valle</HI> all the Provinces in <HI>India</HI> have one and the same Language, though peculiar Letters; for notwithstanding that the Language or Speech is understood in divers Countreys, yet the Characters are different.</P>
<P>The Learned sort, or <HI>Brahmans,</HI> have a Lan∣guage and Letters by <HI>Kircher</HI> call'd <HI>Nagher,</HI> which being accounted Sacred, is onely known to their Tribe or Family, and us'd amongst them as <HI>Latine</HI> amongst the Learned in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Their Characters are fair and large, taking up much room: They also differ much from the Letters us'd by the <HI>Benjan</HI> Merchants in <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>According to Mr. <HI>Edward Terry,</HI> the Vulgar Tongue of the Countrey of <HI>Indostan</HI> hath great Affinity with the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Tongues; but is pleasanter and easier to pronounce. It is a very fluent Language, expressing many things in few words. They write and read like us, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Left to the Right Hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court-Language is wholly <HI>Persi∣an.</HI></NOTE>In <HI>India,</HI> and the Countreys under the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Jurisdiction, the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue is more common <HI>Indian,</HI> being generally spoken by the Nobility at Court, and us'd in all Publick Busi∣nesses and Writings; which cannot seem strange to any, considering the <HI>Mogollean</HI> Princes have their Extract from <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>Samarcand,</HI> whence the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue was first brought.</P>
<P>The Vulgar <HI>Mahumetans, Peruschi</HI> tells us, speak the <HI>Turkish</HI> Tongue, but not so eloquently as the natural born <HI>Turks.</HI> Learned Persons, and <HI>Mahu∣metan</HI> Priests, speak the <HI>Arabick,</HI> in which the <HI>Al∣coran</HI> and other Books are written.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Malayan</HI> Tongue much us'd.</NOTE>But no Language extends further, and is of greater use, than the <HI>Malayan,</HI> so call'd from the City <HI>Malacka,</HI> from whence it hath its Original. It is spoken in all the Isles lying in the Straights of <HI>Sunda,</HI> and through the adjacent Countrey; but especially us'd by Merchants.</P>
<P><HI>Linschot</HI> tells us, That many People of divers Nations, which came to build the City, and set∣tle in <HI>Malacka,</HI> made this peculiar Language of all the other <HI>Indian</HI> Tongues, consisting of the most pleasing Words, and neatest manner and way of speaking, of all other the Neighboring People; which makes this Language to be the best and most eloquent of all <HI>India,</HI> and also the most use∣ful, and easiest to learn: For there is not one Mer∣chant which comes from the neighboring Coun∣treys to Trade here, but learns this Tongue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Netherland East-India Company</HI> have lately printed a Dictionary of the Common Discourse in that Tongue, as also the New Testament, and other Books, in the same Language. Moreover, the <HI>Holland</HI> Ministers, in their several Factories in <HI>India,</HI> teach in the <HI>Malayan</HI> Tongue, not onely in their Churches, but Schools also.</P>

<HEAD>The Creation of the World in Ten Bodily Appearances of <HI>Wistnow,</HI> or <HI>Mahadeu.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creation of the World.</NOTE>THe Creation of the World (as we have already mention'd) the <HI>Brahmans</HI> ascribe to one <HI>Bramma,</HI> by the Power given him from <HI>Wistnow,</HI> or <HI>Mahadeu:</HI> But these People rest not in the making of one; for they form di∣vers imaginary Worlds, which in the form of an Egg drive on the Water, which being without the Principal World, is God himself, as shall be declared hereafter more at large.</P>
<P>Some have not stuck to affirm. That <HI>Bramma</HI> made fourteen Worlds, agreeing with the Parts of Humane Bodies; <HI>viz.</HI> the first, and uppermost Celestial World, out of the Brain; the second, out of the Eyes; the third, out of the Mouth; the fourth, out of the Left Ear; the fifth, out of the Roof of the Mouth; the sixth, out of the Heart; the seventh, out of the Belly; the eighth, out of the Privities; the ninth, out of the Left Thigh; the tenth, out of the Knees; the ele∣venth, out of the Legs; the twelfth, out of the Toes of the Right Foot; the thirteenth, out of the Toes of the Left Foot; and the fourteenth, out of the Air round about him. Out of these Worlds he also created Man, according to the qualities of Humane Bodies: <HI>viz.</HI> Out of the first he created Men with Prudence and Under∣standing; out of the second, with Conduct in Transitory things; out of the third, good Ora∣tors; out of the fourth, subtile and crafty People; out of the fifth, Gluttons and debauch'd Persons; out of the sixth, Noble and Famous Men; out of the seventh, Slovens and Ill-natur'd: out of the eighth, Lascivious and Venerial Humorists; out of the ninth, Handicrafts and Husband-men; out of the tenth, Gard'ners and Rusticks; out of the eleventh, poor Laborers; out of the twelfth, Murderers, Robbers, and Thieves; out of the thirteenth, Oppressors of the Poor; and out of the fourteenth, People endued with all manner of excellent qualities.</P>
<P>In this manner they describe the great <HI>Bramma,</HI> Creator of so many People and Worlds; which they believe so firmly in every particular, that they represent his Image in all their <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples, with a Circle on every of the fore∣mention'd Parts, in stead of a World.</P>
<P>The World (as we said before) they affirm to drive on the Waters in the form of an Egg, which incloses Heaven, Earth, and Hell.</P>
<P>In this Egg they also know how to find the fourteen Parts of the World. Under the Earth they place <HI>Patalam,</HI> that is, <HI>The Infernal Pit;</HI> above it, the <HI>Surgam,</HI> that is, <HI>Heaven,</HI> or <HI>Brammar-Lokon;</HI> and above that, <HI>Kailosom, Lilaweicontam,</HI> and <HI>Weicontam;</HI> in which three last Places, they say, God himself resides. The Earth, or Globe of the World which we inhabit, they call <HI>Boulocon.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Boulocon,</HI> say they, comprehends seven Worlds more, each separated from the other by a Sea. The World seated at the Center, they say, is surrounded with a Sea of clear, sweet Water; the next to it, with a Sea of Milk, on which they make the Mountain <HI>Tricoweta</HI> stand, which is 10000 Leagues high and as many broad; the third, with a Sea of Butter; the fourth, with a Sea of <HI>Tayer,</HI> or Cream; the fifth, with a Sea of Wine; the sixth, with a Sea of Syrrup; the seventh, with a Sea of Salt Water, which is our World; all which have their Names from those Seas which surround them.</P>
<P>According to others, there are seven Seas in this our World alone, <HI>viz.</HI> one of Water, one of Milk, one of Cream, one of Butter, one of Salt, one of Sugar, and one of Wine.</P>

<P>In the Watery Sea they place five Paradises; in the Milky Sea, the Spiritual Priests which are call'd <HI>Jogues;</HI> in the third, by them nam'd <HI>The Glory of Divenderen,</HI> those which are inclin'd to Bodily Pleasures; in the fourth, which is <HI>The Glory of Brama,</HI> the Happy and Fortunate; in the fifth, which is <HI>The Glory of Wistnow,</HI> the Unfortu∣nate; in the sixth, call'd <HI>The Glory of Kailasan,</HI> the Poor; and in the seventh, call'd <HI>The Glory of Va∣jacandam,</HI> the Rich.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mountain <HI>Merowa.</HI></NOTE>In this World they place the Mountain <HI>Merowa,</HI> which they affirm higher than the eight foremen∣tion'd Worlds which are above <HI>Boulocon,</HI> and ex∣tends a vast way downwards below <HI>Patalam,</HI> or <HI>The Infernal Pit;</HI> and that the Sun, Moon, and Stars move about it; and that those which shall taste of the Fruits which grow thereon, will never be hungry, dry, nor grow old.</P>
<P>On this Mountain come no Humane Crea∣tures, except the <HI>Deweta's,</HI> which are the Sons of <HI>Diti</HI> Wife to <HI>Cassiopa.</HI></P>
<P>And notwithstanding they ascribe the Begin∣ning and Creation of the World to <HI>Bramma,</HI> yet they seem to make the World in a manner perpe∣tual, ascribing to it four Ages:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The four A∣ges of the World.</NOTE> The first they call <HI>Critaigom,</HI> or <HI>Cortesuigke;</HI> the second, <HI>Tretasuigke,</HI> or <HI>Treitagom;</HI> the third, <HI>Duaparugam,</HI> or <HI>Duaper∣suigke;</HI> the fourth, <HI>Caligom,</HI> or <HI>Calisuigke.</HI> The three first are already expired; but the last is still in being.</P>
<P>The first Age (say they) continu'd 17 <HI>Lak</HI> and 28000 Years (each <HI>Lak</HI> they reckon to be 100000 Years;) the second 12000 <HI>Lak</HI> and 96000 Years; the third, 8 <HI>Lak</HI> and 64000 Years; the fourth Age which is yet running, will last 4 <HI>Lak,</HI> or 432000 Years, of which, according to their Annual Accounts, are already expir'd, to this present Year 1671, 4772 Years: So that the World, according to their Calculation, will scarce ever have an end; for they certainly af∣firm, That a thousand times turning of the Four Ages <HI>Cotesuigke, Tretasuigke, Dwapur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gam, Calli∣suigke,</HI> is but onely one day in the Account of <HI>Bramma</HI> who, they say, is to live a hundred Years of such Days, and that fifty thereof are already past, and the one and fiftieth running on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They believe a general Conflagrati∣on of the World.</NOTE>After the expiration of this time, they believe the World shall be consum'd by Fire; after which, the surface of the Earth will be cover'd with Water, and the Rain fall in such abundance, as if it were powr'd out of the Trunk of an Ele∣phant; and not long after, <HI>Bramma</HI> will die.</P>
<P>In these four Ages great Miracles and Wonders have, as they affirm, been perform'd by four of their Idols, of which they make mention in their Writings call'd <HI>The Ten Altars.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ten Ap∣pearances of <HI>Wistnow.</HI></NOTE>And, as they affirm, their Supreme God <HI>Wist∣now,</HI> or <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> performed these Miracles in this lowermost World in ten peculiar Bodily Shapes, which is also mention'd by <HI>Barthrouherri,</HI> in his Book of Conversation, where he saith, <HI>Wistnow hath taken the trouble upon him of being reborn ten times;</HI> and that these Births were in the manner following.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Wistnow</HI> was born, and appear'd as a <HI>Matja</HI> or Fish.</P>
<P>Secondly, As a <HI>Gourma</HI> or Tortoise.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Like a <HI>Warraha,</HI> or Hog.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Like a <HI>Narafimha,</HI> half Man, half Lion.</P>
<P>Fifthly, By the name of <HI>Wamana,</HI> a little <HI>Bram∣masary.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, By the name of <HI>Paresje Rama,</HI> a <HI>Set∣trean.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly, By the name of <HI>Deserratha Rama</HI> An <HI>Ajot-ja.</HI></P>
<P>Eighthly, By the name of <HI>Cristna,</HI> Brother to <HI>Bella Rama</HI> a <HI>Settrean.</HI> Amongst all the ten Ap∣pearances this is accounted the most eminent; for when <HI>Wistnow</HI> came into the World by the name of <HI>Cristna,</HI> he was accompanied with his whole God∣head, and left the Heavens empty; when as in the other Appearances he came onely with a part of his Godhead, like a Spark which flies from a Great Coal of Fire.</P>
<P>Ninthly, By the name of <HI>Boudha.</HI></P>
<P>And tenthly, In the shape of <HI>Kelki,</HI> or a Horse.</P>
<P><HI>Kircher</HI> relates, from the Information of <HI>Henry Roth</HI> a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> long conversant in these Parts, That the Heathen <HI>Indians</HI> which live about <HI>Ganges</HI> acknowledge in some measure a Trinity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They ac∣knowledge in some measure a Trinity.</NOTE> and af∣firm, that the second Person hath already appear'd nine times in the Flesh, and is to appear once more. The Persons of the Trinity are by them nam'd <HI>Brahma, Bexno,</HI> and <HI>Mahex,</HI> which are all one and the same in Nature, though distingush'd by several Names; as <HI>Acher,</HI> that is, <HI>Immovable; Paramanand▪</HI> or <HI>Supreme Lord; Ons,</HI> or <HI>Being;</HI> and many such like.</P>
<P>Moreover, that which <HI>Mahadeu</HI> perform'd in the World in each of the formention'd Bodily Shapes, some relate more at large; and being written in their <HI>Vedam,</HI> or Law-book, is to this effect.</P>

<P>WHen in the First Age the World was wholly spoil'd, and no Belief amongst Men, the Serpent <HI>Signage,</HI> or <HI>Seesja,</HI> with a hun∣dred Heads (who supported the World) fainted through the weight of the Peoples sins; insomuch that not being able to bear the same up any long∣er, he went from it, and thereby turning the whole World topsie-turvey, at last thrust it into a bottomless Sea, where all the Creatures were drown'd.</P>
<P>Thereupon <HI>Bramma</HI> the four-headed God im∣plor'd <HI>Wistnow</HI> to fetch the World out of the bot∣tomless Water, and place it on the dry Land again.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahadeu</HI>'s strange shape in his third appearance.</NOTE> <HI>Mahadeu</HI> consenting to his Request, de∣scended in the following Shape; <HI>viz.</HI> He had a Head like a Hog, with two mighty Tusks, bigger than those of an Elephant; a Body like a Man, with four Arms and Hands, in one of which he held the great and terrible Sword <HI>Godda,</HI> and on the first Finger of the other Hand a Ring; in the third the before-mention'd great Horn which they call <HI>Sank;</HI> and in the fourth, the Book <HI>Kittaep.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner <HI>Mahadeu</HI> descended, first no big∣ger than a Dwarf; but grew ere long to that horrible bigness, before he came quite down, that had the Earth been above the Waters, and he stood upon it, he would undoubtedly have touch'd the Heavens with his Head.</P>
<P>In this horrid Shape he div'd into the Deep, where he kill'd the Monstrous Giant <HI>Hirnacks,</HI> or <HI>Hirnacas,</HI> which colour'd the whole Sea as red as Blood; and <HI>Mahadeu</HI> made him his Footstool to tread on, and striking his Tusks into the World, pull'd up the same out of the Waters; and calling the Tortoise and thousand-headed Serpent <HI>Signage</HI> to him, he plac'd the Tortoise above the Waters, and upon the Tortoise the Serpent <HI>Signage,</HI> and above him the World. This done, he ascended again into Heaven; and with one word <HI>Bramma</HI> created new Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans,</HI> and other Tribes of the <HI>Indians,</HI> seem highly to esteem this Appearance of <HI>Wistnow</HI> in the shape of a Man, with four Arms, and a Hogs Head; for in the City <HI>Trimottam,</HI> about <HI>Zinzi,</HI> is a <HI>Pagode</HI> or Temple call'd <HI>Adi Warraha,</HI> in which a Hogs head stands to publick view, which the <HI>Brahmans</HI> affirm grew out of the Ground, and worship as the Image of <HI>Wistnow,</HI> in commemoration of his Birth in that shape.</P>
<P>Above <HI>Wistnow</HI> or <HI>Mahadeu</HI> sits the fair dancing Maid <HI>Remba,</HI> with her Legs across under her.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Giant <HI>Hirnacs</HI> re∣presentation.</NOTE>The Giant <HI>Hirnacs,</HI> lying under <HI>Mahadeu</HI>'s Feet, is represented in the shape of a horrible Demon, with two Horns on his Haed, mighty great Ears, and bristly Hair on his Forehead and the Crown of his Head. Cross his left Shoulder hangs a Black String; his Body, from Head to Foot, full of bloody Spots: His Fingers are like those of a Man; but his Toes are rather Claws.</P>

<P>WHen in the First Age the Giant <HI>Hirren∣kessep</HI> had by great Penance and Religi∣ous Exercises moved <HI>Bramma</HI> the four-headed God to appear unto him, and had obtain'd his Request, he ask'd him what he desir'd: whereto <HI>Hirrenkessep</HI> replied,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hirenkessep</HI>'s Request to <HI>Bramma.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Most powerful</HI> Bramma, <HI>make me by your Favours a Monarch, and mighty Prince on Earth; and thereby grant that I may never be kill'd either by Heaven, Earth, Water, Sun, Moon, Planets, Clouds, Wind, Hail, Snow, Rain, Thunder, Lightning, Birds, Beasts, Fishes, Men, Devils, Serpents, Adders, Poyson, Swords, Arrows, nor by any other Weapons, neither without my House nor within it, by Day nor by Night.</HI> All which <HI>Bramma</HI> promising him, the Giant <HI>Hirrenkessep</HI> raised himself, and left off im∣ploring <HI>Bramma</HI> any longer; but marching into the Field, conquer'd many Towns and Countreys, and by Degrees subdu'd the whole World: Which done, he publish'd an Edict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Edict.</NOTE> whereby he commanded all Men, on pain of death, to worship no Deity but him onely; and that all those which should be found to do the contrary, should die without mercy.</P>

Soon after <HI>Brellade</HI> was com∣manded by <HI>Mahadeu</HI> to enter on the Throne in his Father's stead, who Reigned many years very pi∣ously, and kept his Mother <HI>Naeksea</HI> by him during his Life.</P>
<P><HI>Mahadeu</HI> having perform'd all this in three days, ascended up to Heaven again; and so ended the fourth Altar in the first Age <HI>Cortesingke,</HI> after a Reign of seventeen hundred twenty eight thou∣sand years, in which hapned all the foremention'd Wonders.

<HEAD><HI>Vanam</HI>'s Altar, the Fifth, begins with the second Age <HI>Tretrsingke.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>MAhadeu,</HI> in the first Age, had plac'd a <HI>Ragia Inder</HI> in Heaven, to Govern the happy Souls, as a Reward for his pious Life and continual Offerings, which whil'st he liv'd on Earth he made every day in honor of <HI>Ma∣hadeu,</HI> with promise mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>over, that he should enjoy that place till some body else should exceed him: for he had made a hundred <HI>Siasjas,</HI> which are costly Offerings, in honor of <HI>Mahadeu;</HI> and besides all that, forsook his Estate, Wife and Children, nay, his own Life, and spent all his time in Fasting and Praying.</P>
<P>Moreover, in this second Age was born a <HI>Bell Ragia,</HI> who growing up to a Youth, betook him∣self to the reading of holy Books, and amongst many other things read, that a King was plac'd in Heaven to Govern the happy Souls, till such time as some one should exceed him, as abovesaid. Since which this <HI>Ragia,</HI> being a powerful King, to exceed <HI>Ragia Inder</HI> in Piety, spent whole days in searching and reading of holy Books; nor had he any sooner ended one <HI>Siasja</HI> or Offering, but he immediately prepar'd another, insomuch that the ninety ninth <HI>Siasja</HI> or Offering was burning in ho∣nor of <HI>Mahadeu.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ragia Inder</HI> fearing that he should be conquer'd in Piety, begg'd <HI>Mahadeu</HI> to prevent <HI>Bell Ragia,</HI> that he might not exceed him in his constant De∣votion; whereupon <HI>Mahadeu</HI> answer'd, <HI>Be of good chear,</HI> Ragia Inder, <HI>I will never permit any one to pluck you out of your Throne;</HI> and immediately af∣ter descending in the shape of a black Dwarf, and taking upon him the Name of <HI>Vanam,</HI> he in that manner went to <HI>Bell Ragia</HI>'s Court, before the Gates whereof the Priests and <HI>Brahmans</HI> were continually reading of holy Books, and explain∣ing them; for which they receiv'd a Reward ac∣cording to their merits from the King, who to some gave Jewels and Precious Stones, to others Money, and the like. Amongst these learned Peo∣ple <HI>Vanam</HI> betaking himself, read with wonderful exactness and distinction, and explain'd the most mysterious places so well, that he was admir'd by all that were present, especially by <HI>Bell Ragia;</HI> who causing him to be brought before him, ask'd him if he was the Person that read with such wonder∣ful exactness? <HI>Vanam</HI> replying <HI>Yes,</HI> was answer'd by <HI>Bell Ragia</HI> in this manner: <HI>I have long study'd and read the words of God, and have heard many a Learned</HI> Brahman, <HI>but never any equal to you; pray tell me who you are, and of what Family.</HI> To which <HI>Vanam</HI> reply'd, <HI>I am a poor distressed</HI> Brahman, <HI>and come to beg Alms of you for</HI> Mahadeu<HI>'s sake.</HI> Then <HI>Bell Ragia</HI> bid him ask what he would, and it should be granted him. Whereupon <HI>Vanam</HI> de∣sir'd that he would give him so much free Land as he could stride over at three Paces. <HI>This is but little</HI> (reply'd <HI>Bell Ragia</HI>) <HI>you had better have ask'd a a pleasant Dwelling with a great Tract of Land, and Springs of Water belonging to it, some rich Jewels, or large Sums of Money, which might afford you a Main∣tenance as long as you live.</HI> But <HI>Vanam</HI> persisting in his former Request, and <HI>Bell Ragia</HI> agreeing to it, <HI>Confirm this to me,</HI> said <HI>Vanam;</HI> which <HI>Bell Ragia</HI> did, by taking a golden Cruise fill'd with fresh Water, and pouring the same over both <HI>Vanam</HI>'s Hands (which from that time to this day hath been us'd amongst the <HI>Heathens,</HI> to confirm any thing of great consequence;) this being done, <HI>Va∣nam</HI> made one step from <HI>Bell Ragia,</HI> and took the second step from the Earth into the Clouds; which when <HI>Bell Ragia</HI> saw, it so amaz'd him, that he cry'd out, <HI>This cannot be done without Divine As∣sistance, the Hand of God is in this Business.</HI> Then <HI>Vanam</HI> ask'd where he should take the third step? <HI>Bell Ragia</HI> reply'd, <HI>I know no other place (for you have already stradled over Heaven and Earth, which I command) but my Heart and Body, on which you
<PB N="138" REF="105"/>freely step:</HI> Whereupon <HI>Vaman</HI> stepping with wonderful swiftness and strength on <HI>Bell Ragia</HI>'s Breast, forc'd him into the infernal Pit call'd <HI>Patalseegh</HI> or <HI>Patalam,</HI> where <HI>Nagelook,</HI> or horrid Serpents like Men reside, over which <HI>Vanam</HI> made him Prince or <HI>Ragia,</HI> and chang'd his Name from <HI>Bell Ragia</HI> into that of <HI>Worron. Bell Ragia</HI>'s Wife being much troubled hereat, ask'd <HI>Mahadeu</HI> why he had dealt so by her Husband? and if that were the Reward for all his pious Actions? To which <HI>Mahadeu</HI> answer'd, <HI>Be of good chear, Woman, you shall be brought to your Husband, to live with him in the place where he is;</HI> which he had no sooner said, but he convey'd her to <HI>Worron,</HI> whom (as a Re∣ward for his many great Offerings) he made Prince of the Pit of Darkness; and in token of Honor, debased himself so low, as to be his Porter for nine days in his dark Realm.

<HEAD><HI>Prasseram</HI>'s, or <HI>Paresje Rama</HI>'s Altar, the Sixth.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of <HI>Prasserams,</HI> or the second Altar of this Age, <HI>Braman</HI> and <HI>Braminin,</HI> a Marry'd Couple, dwelling near the Stream <HI>Bewa,</HI> liv'd a long time very piously; but the Woman being barren, had neither Son nor Daughter, which made them both very melan∣choly, because it is a great reproach amongst the <HI>Benjans</HI> to be barren: But that they might not be despis'd nor scorn'd, they resolv'd to go from thence, and went into a solitary and thirsty Wil∣derness, that there they might worship <HI>Mahadeu</HI> out of sight of all People, and implore him to open her Womb; after long ranging through divers Wildernesses, they at last came into a Wood, near an ancient consecrated <HI>Pagode,</HI> sha∣dow'd by a great Tree, under which they lying down together to rest, the Woman said to her Husband, <HI>Let us call upon</HI> Mahadeu <HI>here in this place, that he may open my Womb, and make me fruit∣ful;</HI> then both kneeling down on the Ground, they Pray'd with great zeal; but not being heard, the Woman said to her Husband, <HI>Perhaps</HI> Maha∣deu <HI>is not pleas'd, that we should worship him with so much ease in so cool a place, and therefore would be bet∣ter pleas'd if we should first chastise our Bodies, and so humble our selves; come therefore and let us forsake this shady and delightful place, and in the day-time ex∣pose our Bodies to the heat of the Sun, and in the night to the cold Winds, Rain, and all other hardships for his sake, that he may hear our Prayer, and make me fruit∣ful.</HI> After having a long time been thus earnest in their Prayers, they still, as before, had no au∣dience; whereupon the Woman said to her Hus∣band, <HI>I have no mind to live longer, but had rather die (if it would please God) than live under this re∣proach.</HI> To which her Husband reply'd, <HI>Let us try the last means, and continue so long Fasting and Praying till we end this miserable Life by hunger and hardship, or else be heard.</HI> Whereupon they both betook themselves to Fasting and Prayer more than ever they had done before, and after they had spent nine days without eating or drinking, <HI>Mahadeu</HI> appear'd to them in the likeness of a lit∣tle beautiful Child, and ask'd them what they re∣quested of Heaven in this their humble Posture? whereupon they reply'd, <HI>Our Prayers are to</HI> Maha∣deu, <HI>onely for a fruitful Womb, and that I</HI> (said she) <HI>may bear as fair, a Son as your self:</HI> Mahadeu an∣swer'd, <HI>Why do you ask for Children to trouble you more in this miserable Life? had you not better have begg'd for Gold, Silver, or other Riches, to make your days happy, in stead of spending them in sorrow and trouble.</HI> The Woman replying, said, <HI>No Treasures or Pleasures of this Life can bring such joy, as a Son of that perfection with your self.</HI> Mahadeu hereupon reply'd, <HI>Your Desires shall be fulfill'd; and as you have Pray'd three times one after another, so shall you have three Sons one after another;</HI> which said, he vanish'd, and both the <HI>Brahman</HI> and his Wife be∣ing consum'd and wasted by long Fasting, dy'd, and the Ghost of the Woman was sent into the Body of the new born <HI>Reneka,</HI> and that of the <HI>Braman</HI> into the Body of a new born <HI>Brahman,</HI> call'd <HI>Siamdichemi,</HI> who coming to age, were Marry'd together. This <HI>Reneka,</HI> Consort to <HI>Si∣amdichemi,</HI> had a Sister who was Marry'd to a powerful <HI>Ragia,</HI> call'd <HI>Sistraersim,</HI> with a thousand mighty Arms. <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> and <HI>Reneka</HI> going both to a great Wood lying near the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> there built a Straw Hut, where they resolv'd to lead a religious Life, and feed on nothing but the Fruits of the Field and Trees; thus spending their time in Praying without cessation, they ob∣tain'd from <HI>Mahadeu</HI> power to raise the Dead to life again. Not long after, <HI>Reneka</HI> (according to <HI>Mahadeu</HI>'s Promise) was impregnated, and bore a beautiful Son, which she call'd <HI>Prasseram,</HI> whom they instructed in all pious Exercises, and brought him up very religiously, insomuch that by the twelfth year of his age he understood the mysteri∣ous meaning of all those things which his Father read to him, and could readily explain them. His Mother had also by her pious Life obtain'd a Cloth which held Water, which she daily fetcht in the same out of the River <HI>Ganges;</HI> but on a time going thither as she was wont, she espy'd the mighty <HI>Ragia Sistraersim,</HI> with his Consort her Sister, and the whole Court, riding a Hunting; <HI>Reneka</HI> stepping on one side, ask'd one of the Ser∣vants who it was that Hunted with so great a Train? whereupon the Servant reply'd, <HI>It is the mighty</HI> Ragia Sistraersim, <HI>with his Queen;</HI> who not taking any notice of her, caus'd her to go mourn∣fully to the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and there to pour forth these sorrowful Complaints: <HI>O how happy is my Sister! and to what a high pitch hath Fortune rais'd her above me! she is a Queen, and I disconsolate</HI> Brahman<HI>'s Wife; she is stor'd with Riches and Honor, I with Poverty and Sorrow; O how unequal are these transi∣tory things distributed! with how much more delight doth the one spend his days beyond the other?</HI> After these Complaints ended, she went to take up her Cloth full of Water as she us'd to do, to carry it to her Hut, but it suddenly ran through, and would not hold as it had done formerly, which made her very sorrowful, insomuch that she fear'd to go home, and stay'd till almost Sun-setting. When <HI>Siamdichemi,</HI> who extreamly long'd for her, look∣ing out at the Door, saw her stand in a mournful posture whereupon he ask'd her whether she had brought any Water? she with a sorrowful Coun∣tenance said <HI>No,</HI> relating what had hapned, he angrily reply'd, <HI>Well I am assur'd, that you have spoken something in scorn and derision of my pious Life,</HI>

Have not I ever been careful to do you Service to the utmost of my power? Have I not night and day spent my Sighs, Groans, and Prayers to</HI> Maha∣deu, <HI>and willingly undergone all the Pennances that can extend to Piety?

Moreover, <HI>Prasseram</HI> being so far learn'd in their Religion and the Mysteries thereof, though he was but twelve years old, that his Father was not able to teach him any more, he upon his Father's Command, went to <HI>Ragia Inder,</HI> King of the happy Souls in the Realm of <HI>Happiness,</HI> that he might be better instructed by him. No sooner was <HI>Prasseram</HI> departed from his Father, but set∣ting himself down on the Ground, he laid his Legs across under him, with a stedfast resolu∣tion to sit in that posture twelve years, and spend all that time in Praying to <HI>Mahadeu.</HI> Mean while <HI>Reneka</HI> serv'd her Husband with her utmost endea∣vors, and the Love between them grew to that heighth, that next to <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> there was nothing which she affected more than <HI>Siamdichemi;</HI> when at last the mighty <HI>Ragia Sistraersim</HI> going a Hunt∣ing with his whole Retinue, which made a small Army, and ranged through several Hills, Dales, Woods, and Mountains, came at last to the Ri∣ver <HI>Ganges,</HI> and knowing the Wood where his Wives Sister and her Husband dwelt, resolv'd to visit him with his whole Train, commanding all his People to pack up their travelling Apparel, and other things, and Lodge with him at <HI>Siamdi∣chemi</HI>'s Habitation: Immediately after all things were made ready, they entred into the pious <HI>Siam∣dichemi</HI>'s Hut, and found him in a deep sleep, in∣somuch that he wak'd not with all their noise, as beating of Drums, sounding of Horns, and bark∣ing of Dogs; but his Wife taking warm Water, wash'd the Crown of his Head therewith, and so wak'd him. <HI>Ragia Sistraersim</HI> having saluted <HI>Siam∣dichemi,</HI> told him, that he had heard much of his religious Life, which had brought him thither, with intention to lie there that Night with all his Followers, and to Sup with him. <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> was not a little troubled hereat, not knowing how to feed so many thousand People; but remem∣bring that <HI>Ragia Inder</HI> kept the white Cow <HI>Cam∣doga,</HI> and that those which have the same in their House should want for nothing, he therefore earnestly implor'd <HI>Inder</HI> to lend him the same for a small time, that these People might see what it was to be pious, and that the Religious never want for any thing. <HI>Inder</HI> granting his Request, imme∣diately sent the white Cow, with Orders to run directly through the Woods to <HI>Samdichemi</HI>'s poor Hut, where coming, she was by him receiv'd, and ty'd by a small Cord. The time to eat, being come, <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> desir'd <HI>Ragia Sistraersim,</HI> that he would be pleas'd, with his Retinue, to seat him∣self, whil'st he fetch'd them Meat, asking also what they would please to have? desiring each Person to tell him what they lov'd best, for he could furnish them with any thing. <HI>Ragia Sistraer∣sim</HI> being onely come to see his poor manner of living, and to despise it (for he thought it impos∣sible that he and his Followers could be all En∣tertain'd there,) stood seemingly amaz'd, and mer∣rily ask'd his Brother-in-law to Present him with some Jewels and Precious Stones? who answer'd, <HI>All what you desire, Brother, you shall have,</HI> and im∣mediately gave him such Jewels as he had never seen before. Next he ask'd for Clothes, not onely for himself, but for all his Attendants, which he likewise fetch'd out of his Hut, and all things else which he requested, besides a great Sum of Mo∣ney to each of his Servants; which the <HI>Ragia</HI> ob∣serving, stay'd with him that Night, and the suc∣ceeding Day. When it was time to eat, they wanted neither Meat nor Drink, but whatsoever they desir'd was brought them. After the same manner they were Entertain'd the third day. The mighty <HI>Ragia Sistraersim</HI> could not admire sufficiently from whence all the Riches, Clothes, Meat and Drink was brought: for that which <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> had already expended, amounted to a very great Sum of Money, his House or Hut not being able to contain a third part of the Goods, which he had distributed amongst them; where∣fore the <HI>Ragia</HI> suppos'd that the Hut stood over a deep Pit, out of which all things were brought, and to discover it he sent Spyes, who looking through a Creviss, saw the foremention'd Cow, which vomited all these things out of her Mouth; which they told <HI>Ragia;</HI> who taking his leave the next day, and being ask'd by <HI>Sistraersim</HI> if he had receiv'd satisfaction in his Entertainment, and if he desir'd ought else? <HI>Ragia</HI> reply'd, <HI>Nothing but the white Cow which is in your Hut;</HI> which exceed∣ingly troubled him, and being amaz'd, answer'd, That she was none of his own, and therefore he could not give her away: <HI>How!</HI> (said <HI>Sistraersim</HI>) <HI>Do you now refuse to give me this Cow, whenas you have given me so many excellent things before?</HI> To which <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> reply'd, <HI>The other was in my power, but this is not.</HI> To which <HI>Sistraersim</HI> an∣swer'd, <HI>Do you not know my might and power, that though you refuse me the Cow, I can immediately take her away by force?</HI> and immediately calling his Men together, commanded the stoutest to take away the Cow from <HI>Siamdichemi,</HI> who seeing her thus pull'd away, cry'd aloud, <HI>Whether do you go? how shall I pacifie</HI> Ragia Inder? <HI>do not suffer your self to be thus carry'd away for a spoil, but take revenge at once of yours and my Enemies.</HI> The Cow hearing these words, and being provok'd thereby, imme∣diately became thrice as big as she was before, and
<PB N="140" REF="107"/>began to trample and to push down many of them, insomuch that several thousands were kill'd, ei∣ther by her Horns, or else trodden to death under her Feet; after which she immediately fled to the Habitation of <HI>Ragia Inder. Sistraersim</HI> seeing such a destruction made amongst his Followers, and the Cow out of his power flown into the Skie, believ'd that his Brother-in-law had pri∣vately utter'd some conjuring words, which made the Cow do him so much mischief, therefore be∣ing highly incens'd, said to his Attendants, <HI>Come, let us all go back to the cursed Hut of</HI> Siamdichemi, <HI>for I will not depart hence, till I have reveng'd my self by his Death:</HI> Accordingly they with all their force fell upon his Hut, and as a Reward for all his kindness in Entertaining him and his Retinue for three days together, and giving him so many rich Presents, most cruelly and ungratefully beat out his Brains. The unfortunate <HI>Reneka</HI> seeing her beloved Husband thus inhumanely murther'd, fetch'd the Corps into her Hut, where laying the same in her Lap, she resolv'd not to live long after him, but setting fire on the Hut, burnt her self, and mix'd her Ashes with those of her Husbands. Mean while the Cow coming near <HI>Ragia Inder</HI>'s Habitation, met with <HI>Prasseram,</HI> who asking her from whence she came, was told, That upon <HI>Ra∣gia Inder</HI>'s Command she had been at his Father's House; and also related what had hapned there, <HI>viz.</HI> how ill <HI>Sistraersim</HI> had rewarded his Father for his extraordinary kindness, and how treache∣rously he was murther'd: Whereupon <HI>Prasseram</HI> answer'd, <HI>Let me die, if I do not revenge this one and twenty times over, and destroy all the Ketteries;</HI> now the <HI>Ketteries</HI> were a very wicked People, destroy∣ing more pious <HI>Brahmans</HI> than ever the Giants and Deities had done. Wherefore <HI>Mahadeu</HI> having long before resolv'd to root out the <HI>Ketteries,</HI> he gave the greater strength to <HI>Prasseram,</HI> whereby he obtain'd Victory over them. <HI>Prasseram</HI> hereupon descending in great rage with his <HI>Persy,</HI> Bowes and Arrows in his Hands, amongst the Company of <HI>Ragia Sistraersim,</HI> defeated him and all his Guards; from thence going to all parts of the World, he slew all the <HI>Ketteries</HI> he could meet with, which struck such a terror into the rest, that they forsook and deny'd their own Families and Sects; yet nevertheless <HI>Prasseram</HI> could not find them all out, for in a few years after, a great num∣ber of them getting together, rebell'd again, and forc'd him a second time to War against them, whenas he suppos'd he had before slain them all; but as Weeds will still spring up, so likewise this cursed Tribe was increas'd by those who had be∣fore deny'd their Names, or hid themselves, and thus forc'd <HI>Prasseram</HI> to revenge himself twenty two several times, till at last he left not one of them alive. Moreover <HI>Mahadeu</HI> remembring that he had ask'd <HI>Prasseram</HI>'s Parents three several times what they desir'd, and they crav'd nothing but such a fair Child as he himself then appear'd to them, therefore he resolv'd to give them two such Sons more as this <HI>Prasseram</HI> was: wherefore he commanded the four-headed <HI>Bramma</HI> to send the Souls of <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> and <HI>Reneka</HI> into the Bo∣dies of the <HI>Ragia Disserat</HI> and his Consort <HI>Consila,</HI> who were slain amongst the <HI>Ketteries;</HI> for <HI>Maha∣deu</HI> had promis'd to promote their Family. <HI>Bram∣ma</HI> hereupon looking into the Books of Secrets, and though he found the time of these People come to a period, yet to oblige <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> he ful∣fill'd his Command, and accordingly sent the Soul of <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> into <HI>Ragia Disserat,</HI> and that of <HI>Reneka</HI> into <HI>Consila;</HI> out of which Couple <HI>Ram</HI> was afterwards born, who when he was come to age, Marry'd a <HI>Sita;</HI> but as the Bride and Bride∣groom, according to the Custom of the <HI>Benjans,</HI> were Riding about the City, <HI>Prasseram</HI> met them, and asking the Spectators from what Family the Bridegroom proceeded, was answer'd, That his Name was <HI>Ram,</HI> and that he was of the Tribe of the <HI>Ketteries:</HI> Whereat <HI>Prasseram</HI> being mightily enrag'd, said, <HI>Are there yet more remaining of this Vermin? I will instantly destroy him, as I have done his Predecessors;</HI> and immediately drawing his Bowe to shoot <HI>Ram</HI> as he rode upon an Elephant, <HI>Ram</HI> seeing him aim at him, also drew his Bowe, and coming near one another, let flie their Ar∣rows, which meeting together in the Air, all <HI>Pras∣seram</HI>'s Power went into <HI>Ram</HI>'s Arrow, who by that means was bereav'd of all his Strength, insomuch that he was afterwards no more than an ordinary <HI>Brahman.</HI></P>
<P>Thus with <HI>Prasseram</HI>'s Power also ended his Al∣tar, after a Reign of a thousand years, after which <HI>Ram</HI>'s Altar immediately commenc'd.</P>

<P>AFter the ending of <HI>Prasseram</HI>'s Altar, <HI>Maha∣deu</HI> continu'd the sole <HI>Numen,</HI> and supream Governor of Heaven and Earth; and a∣mongst others, one <HI>Rawan</HI> had continually call'd upon him for three hundred years together, and Offer'd him daily a hundred Camomile Flowers. <HI>Mahadeu</HI> desirous to try the fidelity of <HI>Rawan,</HI> pri∣vately took away one of the Flowers which were prepar'd for the Offering, and then ask'd him why he brought a less Offering than before? <HI>Rawan</HI> ignorant of this Deceit, told over his Flowers, and found but ninety nine, which made him so impa∣tient, that he attempted to pull out one of his Eyes to make up the number; but <HI>Mahadeu</HI> pre∣venting him by holding his Hand, said, <HI>I have sufficient proofs of your integrity, ask therefore of me what you think fit, and I will grant it. Rawan</HI> re∣joyc'd hereat, and begg'd that jointly with him he might Govern the whole World, and Com∣mand over all the People upon the Earth; which though granted, he still persever'd in his Prayers, and continu'd his Oblations; which <HI>Mahadeu</HI> ta∣king notice of, ask'd him why he still kept his old Custom, since his Request was granted? <HI>Because</HI> (reply'd <HI>Rawan</HI>) <HI>I may by your favor obtain ten Heads, and twenty Arms:</HI> All which <HI>Mahadeu</HI> granting, <HI>Rawan</HI> went and setled himself in the Countrey of <HI>Lanka,</HI> now call'd <HI>Ceilon.</HI> After he had Reign'd some thousands of years, he grew very insolent and proud, insomuch that he would not acknow∣ledge <HI>Mahadeu</HI> for his Benefactor, though he had so often worshipp'd him before; nay, he com∣manded his Subjects not to worship <HI>Mahadeu</HI> any longer, but himself, pretending that he could pro∣tect them better: His Subjects obey'd him twenty five years, but at last return'd to their old wont, and

Mean while these People kept a Fast, ab∣staining from all manner of Sustenance for the space of three days.</P>
<P>There was at the same time in the Countrey of <HI>Assouthan,</HI> a <HI>Ragia</HI> or King call'd <HI>Dasserat,</HI> who had three Wives, one of which nam'd <HI>Consila</HI> bore him a fair Son, which by the <HI>Brahmans</HI> was call'd <HI>Wissote Ram,</HI> who grew up in extraordinary Wis∣dom and Knowledge.

<P><HI>Ram</HI> was by the <HI>Brahman Wismawerter</HI> instru∣cted in all Arts and Sciences, in which he made so great a progress, that after many extraordinary Atchievements, he went up to Heaven, and left his Authority to <HI>Hanneman,</HI> a great Ape, who had been his Assistant on Earth, to whom he promis'd, that he should be immortal that consecrated a <HI>Pa∣gode</HI> in honor of him; and that he would always protect his Servants on Earth.</P>
<P>This concluded the whole work of <HI>Ram</HI>'s Altar, and also the <HI>Tretangke,</HI> or second Age, which had lasted one Million two hundred sixty nine thou∣sand years, of which <HI>Ram</HI> had Reign'd two thou∣sand years.</P>
<P>For the good Services done by the Apes to <HI>Ram</HI> in his time, they are held in great veneration by the <HI>Indians;</HI> and in the Kingdoms of <HI>Pegu, Cei∣lon,</HI> and other Places, they set up several Figures of Apes in their <HI>Pagodes;</HI> and this is affirm'd by <HI>Linschot,</HI> who saith, That in former Ages there was no greater, nor more precious a Relick in all <HI>India,</HI> than an Apes Tooth, which being tipt with Gold, and beset with Precious Stones, was kept in a <HI>Pagode</HI> on the Mountain <HI>Piko d' Adam</HI> on the Island <HI>Ceilon;</HI> to which place the <HI>Indians</HI> went in Pilgrimage from all places thereabouts, nay, some came thither out of several Countreys lying four or five hundred Leagues from thence.</P>

The <HI>Ragia Kans,</HI> upon their recommendation sending for him, gave him his Sister in Marriage; and when she had attain'd to the twelfth year of her age, and the <HI>Brahman</HI> to the nineteenth or twen∣tieth, the <HI>Chan,</HI> according to Custom, shew'd them to all his Subjects; after which he commanded <HI>Denki,</HI> and a certain <HI>Brahman</HI> call'd <HI>Naret,</HI> experi∣enc'd in the Art of Astrology, or rather Cheiro∣mancy, and lately come into that Countrey, to come before him, requiring the said <HI>Brahman</HI> to look in <HI>Denkies</HI> Hand, and to tell him whether she should be fortunate or unfortunate, rich or poor, have few or many Children, be short or long liv'd, live joyfully or sorrowfully, what de∣gree of Honor she should attain to, and in short, what would happen to her, strictly charging him to declare the plain truth, without flattery or dis∣simulation. The <HI>Brahman</HI> looking into her Hand upon the Kings Command, and having view'd the same, bespake him after this manner: <HI>My Lord and King, according as the Lines appear here, she will be the Mother of seven Children,</HI> viz. <HI>six Sons and one Daughter, the last whereof will bereave you of your Life and Crown, and Reign in your stead.</HI> This Prog∣nostication of being destroy'd by his own Blood, made the King exceeding sorrowful, insomuch that he commanded <HI>Denki</HI> to depart out of his Pre∣sence, as not worthy to see his Face; nay, he gave order to lock her and her Husband up in the Castle, and to set strong Guards about the same, and commanded all the Midwives, that as soon as ever <HI>Denki</HI> was Deliver'd of a Child, it should immediately be brought to him; which was ac∣cordingly perform'd: for no sooner was the un∣happy <HI>Denki</HI> Deliver'd, but the Infant was in∣stantly carry'd to her Brother, who forthwith kill'd it: Thus he did six several times, <HI>viz.</HI> to five Sons and one Daughter; and when <HI>Denki</HI> had Conceiv'd the seventh time, and <HI>Kans</HI> in∣form'd thereof, he caus'd a stricter Guard to be kept upon her than before, locking her up in a Chamber with seven Iron Doors, and setting a hundred Soldiers to guard them, strictly charging them, that as soon as they heard the Child cry, they should give him notice thereof, that he might dispose of it as he had done of the rest. In the Moneth <HI>Sawanne,</HI> or <HI>Srawanam,</HI> which is our <HI>August,</HI> on the Day <HI>Aerhem,</HI> being the eighth of the dark Moon, the time of her Delivery ap∣proaching, she was exceedingly troubled, to think that this her last Child, of which she expected to be Deliver'd, should be so cruelly murder'd as all the former had been: Sitting thus melancholy, she was on a sudden, without pain, about Mid∣night
<PB N="142" REF="109"/>deliver'd of a most beautiful Son, whose Face was resplendent like the Moon in the Full, insomuch that he enlightned the whole Room. At this <HI>Denki</HI> rejoyc'd exceedingly, and wondred not a little at her beautiful Son; but very much lamented to think what hard fortune was decreed him: But <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> who had inspir'd this Child with his Divine Power, gave him also Speech, so that he comforted his sorrowful Mother with these Words, <HI>viz. That she should rest satisfied, and he would find means to escape his Uncles bloody Hands, and also deliver her from her Imprisonment.</HI> And turning to his Father, he said, <HI>Come swathe me up, and carry me to</HI> Goggel, <HI>on the opposite Shore of the Stream</HI> Siemmena, <HI>into the House of the</HI> Brahman Nen, <HI>whose Wife</HI> Jessouda <HI>is just deliver'd of a Daughter; change me for her, and leaving me there, bring the other Infant hither, and all things will be well.</HI> But the Father replying, said, <HI>How is it pos∣sible for me to carry you out of this close Prison, where not so much as the Wind can find any passage out or in? How then shall I be able to get through these Iron Gates, and great number of Centinels? Trouble not your self</HI> (said <HI>Kisna,</HI> for that was the Name given the Infant by his Father) <HI>about effecting what I have desir'd; for the Doors will fly open, and the Watchmen all fall asleep, so that none shall discover you.</HI> Which the Infant had no sooner said, but the Locks and Bolts flew open, and <HI>Wassendeu</HI> taking the Child in his Arms, walk'd by the Watches, without be∣ing seen by any of them: But coming to the Ri∣ver <HI>Siemmena,</HI> opposite to the City <HI>Goggel,</HI> he was much troubled to see the Water extraordinary high, and run down with great violence; till <HI>Kisna</HI> commanding the River to open a way in the midst for his Father, the Water immediately divided it self, and stood firm on each side, like Walls, until they were past over. Being come to the House of the holy <HI>Brahman Nen,</HI> the Door where∣of opened of it self, <HI>Wassendeu</HI> entred boldly with his Son, and found the <HI>Brahman Nen</HI> with his Wife in a sound sleep; and they not hearing him, he chang'd <HI>Kisna</HI> his Son for the new-born Maid, with whom he return'd to the Prison, the Stream <HI>Siemmena</HI> opening a Path for him, as before. When he was come to the Gates, he found them open, and the Watch still asleep; but no sooner was he entred one Gate, but the same shut after him, and so likewise all the seven. Being come into the Prison, he deliver'd the Child to his Wife; but the Watch awaking, and quickly hearing it cry, they entred the Chamber where these two unfortunate Lovers were lock'd up, and taking the Child from them, carried it to <HI>Ragia Cans,</HI> who seeing that it was a Maid, said, <HI>What did this foolish</HI> Brahman Narret <HI>Prognosticate? He was mad, and did not know the truth of the business. Cans</HI> nevertheless, for fear she might hereafter be∣reave him of his Life, resolv'd to murther her; but taking the Infant by its Legs, intending to strike it against the Wall, it slipp'd out of his Hands, and starting up, said, <HI>O most inhumane Blood-hound! What do you seek to murder me for? I am not the right Party; but he that shall bereave you of Life, Crown, and Realm, and revenge the death of his Bro∣thers and Sister so inhumanely butcher'd by you, is alive and well in the City</HI> Goggel. Which said, the Child flew into the Air, where <HI>Mahadeu</HI> trans∣form'd it into Lightning, which was never seen before that time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ragia Cans</HI> exceedingly amaz'd hereat, and calling all his Council, ask'd what this Won∣der might portend. They all told him, that some great Event would suddenly follow; yet none knew certainly what the issue thereof would be, which made him sorrowful and perplex'd in mind. Mean while being inform'd, That in <HI>Goggel</HI> was a most beautiful Youth, kept by the Pious <HI>Brahman Nen,</HI> he fear'd that he might be the Revenger of the Infants death which he had murder'd, as the Maid had told him; therefore he seriously con∣sider'd how this Youth might also be destroy'd, which by force he durst not attempt, fearing that all his Subjects would oppose him, and the rather, because of the Piety of the <HI>Brahman:</HI> But at last he invented the following means: <HI>viz.</HI> He call'd his eldest Sister <HI>Poetena,</HI> saying; Poetena, <HI>if at once you love me, your own Life, and will preserve my Realm and Crown, then do me this kindness;</HI> viz. <HI>Take Presents with you, and go to the House of the Pious</HI> Brahman Nen, <HI>whose Wife hath lately been deliver'd of a Son, whom I desire you by some means or other to let suck out of your Breast, which you must first annoint with the most powerful Poyson that can be had, that by that means when the Child comes to suck you it may be kill'd.</HI> Which she promising to do, was sent with many rich Presents to <HI>Goggel,</HI> where so soon as she was arriv'd she went to the House of <HI>Nen,</HI> whose Wife she wish'd much Joy with her young Son, giving her great Presents, thereby to be the less mistrusted, and cover her false design; and desir'd to have the Child lie in her Lap, which being given her, and she looking upon it, said, <HI>Indeed the Reports which go of this Youth in</HI> Mottera <HI>are no ways false; for I never saw a more beautiful Babe in my whole life: I do not repent my trouble of coming hither.</HI> Thus <HI>Poetena</HI> flattering the Babe, sometimes kiss'd it, and danc'd it up and down, the better to hide her wicked intent. At last opening her poysonous Bosom, she laid the Infant <HI>Kisna</HI> to the same, hoping that it would there breathe its last; but the Child strengthned by, <HI>Mahadeu</HI>'s Power against all Poysons, taking the Nipple into its Mouth, not onely suck'd away all her Milk, but the Blood out of her Veins, and also her Soul; and by that means immediately growing cold and stiff, she fell down dead: Which when King <HI>Cans</HI> heard, he grew exceeding sor∣rowful, practising divers ways to destroy the In∣fant <HI>Kisna,</HI> but all in vain; for, growing up in years, he for a time became a Herdsman, and under that form wrought many strange Miracles, too tedious to insert: And, amongst others, when the last Hour of his Altar was come, he went out of <HI>Dowarca,</HI> and taking up a handful of Dirt, threw the same over the City, by which means all the Golden Roofs, Streets, and stately Stru∣ctures, became nothing but Hay, Clay, Wood, and Stones. Imediately after which, <HI>Kisna</HI> de∣serting the World, ascended to Heaven, so end∣ing his Altar, which had lasted only a hundred Years, in the third Age call'd <HI>Duapersing,</HI> contain∣ing 864000 Years.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> affirm, That though all the Seas were Ink, and the whole Earth Paper, and all the Inhabitants thereof did nothing but write Night and Day for the space of a hundred thousand Years, yet it was impossible for them to de∣scribe all the Wonders which <HI>Kisna</HI> wrought on Earth in the time of his hundred Years Reign: And they believe, That all those which write the History of <HI>Kisna,</HI> read the same, or hear it read, shall merit very much: Nay, that all those who read it with devotion, shall enter into

<P>AS to what concerns the Religion in these Parts, the Natives are of two sorts, <HI>viz. Pagans,</HI> and <HI>Mahumetans.</HI></P>

<P>That which we will here declare of the <HI>Indians</HI> Religion, is drawn from the <HI>Vedam,</HI> or Book of their Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <HI>Vedam,</HI> what it con∣tains.</NOTE> which comprehends both their <HI>Cre∣denda,</HI> and <HI>Agenda;</HI> what they are to believe, and what Ceremonies they are to perform. This Book being written in Rhyme in the <HI>Samscortam</HI> Tongue, is divided into four Parts: The first call'd <HI>Roggowedam;</HI> the second, <HI>Issourewedam;</HI> the third, <HI>Samawedam;</HI> and the fourth, <HI>Adderawa∣nawedam.</HI></P>
<P>The first part treats of the Original of things; as also of Angels and Souls; of the Reward for good, and Punishment of bad Angels; of Gene∣ration and Corruption; what Sin is; how it can be forgiven; who can do it, and wherefore.</P>
<P>The second gives account of the Governors to whom they ascribe the Dominion of all things.</P>
<P>The third instructs them in Morality, perswades them to be vertuous, and to abhor all manner of Vice.</P>
<P>The fourth describes the Ceremonies which are to be us'd in their <HI>Pagodes,</HI> Offerings, and Feasts. But this Part hath a long time since been lost, by which means the <HI>Brahmans</HI> have lost much of their Power and Respect, which per∣haps was not long before the Birth of our Savior; for it is apparent, that the <HI>Vedam</HI> at that time was very much altered, it sufficiently appearing there∣in, that the Writers thereof were not altogether Strangers to the knowledge of our Saviour, not∣withstanding they kept the same secret, according to the Custom and Manner of the <HI>Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> judge themselves bound and oblig'd to observe the <HI>Vedam,</HI> without any con∣tradiction or exception, when any Text is taken out of the same: But about the sence it self (which is to be observ'd) there arise many diffe∣rences amongst them; for some explain it after one manner, and others after another; though for the clearing or deciding of these Disputations, they have made a <HI>Jestra,</HI> which is a Comment or Explanation thereof.</P>

<PB N="144" REF="112"/>and several other places in <HI>India,</HI> acknow∣ledge not onely one God, but also one onely su∣pream Deity, though perhaps in several places they differ in the Name: for the <HI>Wistnowa's,</HI> other∣wise <HI>Benjans,</HI> account <HI>Wistnow,</HI> by some call'd <HI>Ma∣hadeu,</HI> for the supream; but the <HI>Seivia's</HI> make <HI>Eswara</HI> the chief, which they call by many other Names, and also make him to be of two different Sects; yet nevertheless they adore him not, but make choise of other lesser Deities, which they worship.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> opinion of God.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> judge generally of God, as of a Man, and that that which is pleasing and accepta∣ble to Men, should likewise be so to God; like∣wise that all things which recreate Men, delight God also; wherefore the <HI>Wistnowa's</HI> allow their prime God <HI>Wistnow</HI> a most beautiful Woman, call'd <HI>Laetsemi,</HI> which was thrown up out of the Sea, when it was disturb'd by the Mountain <HI>Me∣rowa,</HI> as is before related. The <HI>Seivia's</HI> or <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> who account <HI>Eswara</HI> for the supream God, allow him another Wife, whom they call <HI>Parvati, Isweri,</HI> or <HI>Parma Isweri,</HI> and also by many other Names.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The extent of <HI>Garrouda</HI> and <HI>Anne∣monta.</HI></NOTE>Amongst the chief of their lesser Deities, which are erected in the great Temple built by the <HI>Wist∣nowa's</HI> in honor of <HI>Wistnow,</HI> stand the Images of <HI>Garrouda</HI> and <HI>Annemonta,</HI> who are both accounted very faithful Servants to <HI>Wistnow,</HI> being ready on all occasions to perform his pleasure: Their Ex∣tract they relate fictitiously, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Garrouda</HI> sprung out of an Egge after a pullulation of five hundred years, with other ridiculous Circum∣stances; and the other of <HI>Annemonta,</HI> who was in the form of an Ape, to be preternatural without Coition of his Parent-Apes. This <HI>Annemonta,</HI> which (as the <HI>Brahmans</HI> affirm) properly signifies the Wind, was ever since his Birth a faithful Ser∣vant to <HI>Wistnow,</HI> when he frequented the Earth under the Name of <HI>Ramma,</HI> wherefore he hath a place set apart for his particular Service in <HI>Wist∣now</HI>'s Temple or <HI>Pagode;</HI> and as <HI>Garrouda</HI> serves <HI>Wistnow</HI> in Heaven, so <HI>Annemonta</HI> executes his Commands on Earth, which he also will desert at last, and ascend up to Heaven.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>India, Cambaya</HI> and <HI>Bengala,</HI> all observe the <HI>Moorish</HI> or <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, be∣cause the <HI>Moors</HI> which are brought Slaves into <HI>India,</HI> have by degrees made themselves Masters, and subduing many of the <HI>Pagans,</HI> have forc'd them to embrace their Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Indians</HI> have many Gods, which they worship as their Protectors, and consecrate <HI>Pagodes</HI> to them. These their Deities were formerly Kings of the Countrey, or famous Heroes, who for their heroick Exploits were very highly reverenc'd amongst them, honoring them as the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> did <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Mars.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mahumeta∣nism</HI> profes∣sed in some places.</NOTE>These divine Heroes are not all one and the same, but very different: for those on the main Land of <HI>India,</HI> which is under the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Jurisdiction, are quite contrary to those in the Kingdom of <HI>Coutzyn,</HI> and in the Countreys lying near the Sea, as also others in <HI>Pegu, Siam, China,</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> This is to be concluded from the se∣veral Names, that differ exceedingly, which pos∣sibly may arise from the several Languages us'd in the various Countreys where they are worship∣ped; yet nevertheless these Demi-gods are but the same, as he who anciently by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> was worshipp'd by the Name of <HI>Osyris,</HI> was by the <HI>Greeks</HI> reverenc'd under the Name of <HI>Bacchus.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their high e∣steem of <HI>Ramna.</HI></NOTE>The number of these ancient Heroes amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> is almost infinite; amongst others one nam'd <HI>Crusen,</HI> is highly esteem'd by them; but the chiefest of all is <HI>Ramo,</HI> or <HI>Ram,</HI> or <HI>Ramna,</HI> which Name is in such veneration amongst them, that they use the same in their Salutations, and in stead of bidding one another Farewel at their de∣parture, they say <HI>Ramo, Ramo.</HI></P>
<P>This Idol is very eminent amongst the <HI>Japan∣ners,</HI> and known by several Names, as <HI>Sotoqui, Siacka, Amida,</HI> and <HI>Saka;</HI> amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> by that of <HI>Sekia</HI> or <HI>Saka;</HI> amongst the <HI>Tungkindans,</HI> by that of <HI>Tecka.</HI> What this <HI>Ramo</HI> did during his stay on Earth, we have already related.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They have Houshold Gods.</NOTE>Besides <HI>Ram,</HI> and many other Gods, they make another every <HI>New-years-day</HI> of some Creature or other, every one selecting that which prov'd suc∣cessful to him on the first day of the new Year. They also carefully preserve that thing which they have elected for their Idol in their House, and worship it as the <HI>Romans</HI> their <HI>Dii Penates,</HI> or domestick Gods, committing all their Concerns to their discretion.</P>
<P>About the latter part of the year they repair to the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> to throw their old Idols into it, that they may chuse new ones, as they had done the year before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Idosl giving answer like Oracles.</NOTE>In many places of <HI>India</HI> are also Idols, which by the delusion and instigation of the Devil are like Oracles, resolving Questions after the same manner as in the time of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> They make their Demands, and speak to them after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> the Implorer having said several Prayers, puts a Flower, or any such like thing into the Hands or Bosom of the Idol, which they desire either to throw to the right Hand, if their Business shall be successful, but if not, to the left; whereupon (as they say) the Idol immediately casts the Flower to the one or other side, according to the intended good or bad suc∣cess of the Business; but if the Idol chance to keep the Flower some time before he throws it away, then they desire him not to delay, and judge also, that the longer he keeps it, the more difficult it will be to accomplish their Designs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They worship the Sun.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> also worship the Sun when it rises and sets, building <HI>Pagodes</HI> in honor of it, wherein they shew Reverence to its Image. Good Angels they call <HI>Dewetaes;</HI> and evil Spirits, <HI>Raets∣jasjaes,</HI> which they believe were begotten by a Man, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Brahman Cassiopa,</HI> who was Father to both his Wives, the one call'd <HI>Deti,</HI> Mother of the <HI>Dewetaes,</HI> and the other <HI>Aditi,</HI> or <HI>Caddrowa∣wiuneta,</HI> Mother of the <HI>Raetsjasjaes.</HI> Moreover, the <HI>Cassiopa</HI> before mention'd, some suppose to be <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Aditi</HI> to be <HI>Eve:</HI> for they maintain that <HI>Cassiopa</HI> was the first <HI>Brahman,</HI> who had a Son by <HI>Bramma:</HI> And (as we have already mention'd) they do not make God to be the Creator of Man∣kind, but one <HI>Bramma,</HI> whom they affirm to have created nine in the beginning, and out of these nine, and those which he begot by his Wife <HI>Saras∣wati,</HI> the whole Generation of Mankind pro∣ceeded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their belief and opinion of the im∣mortality of the Soul.</NOTE>All the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> except some few of them) firmly believe the Immortality of the Soul, but are of divers opinions concerning its original: for some suppose that the Soul had no beginning, but was comprehended in God and his Being; but ac∣cording to others, it lay asleep before the Crea∣tion of the World.

<P>Outward zeal in Religion they judge very ne∣cessary, as appears by their following the Com∣mandments written by <HI>Bramma,</HI> wherein consisted (according to his testimony) the Service of <HI>Wist∣now</HI> and <HI>Eswara,</HI> who require as well the outward Worship as inward Devotion, and to that purpose they have these Commandments, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣mandments impos'd by the <HI>Brahman.</HI></NOTE>I. A Man must not be proud, but wholly give his Thoughts and Soul to God.</P>
<P N="2">II. He must remain God's Servant.</P>
<P N="3">III. He must always be a great Friend to God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. He must think on his Might and Omni∣potence.</P>
<P>Those which concern their outward Worship are these:</P>
<P N="1">I. A Man must always be ready to hear any Discourse of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. He must often call on his Name, and speak of his Glory.</P>
<P N="3">III. He must make use of, and perform his Laws according to the Explanation of the <HI>Brah∣mans.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Their Images they must adorn and beau∣tifie with Ornaments.</P>
<P N="5">V. Lastly, they must worship their Images.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> affirm, that those who for a cer∣tain time faithfully perform and obey the fore∣mention'd Commandments, shall attain to great knowledge, nay, to that perfection, that they shall never need more to observe the outward Ceremonies, but do God great Service by onely thinking on him, and thereby merit Heaven.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their outward Worship, they first (according to the Contents of these Rules) build Temples in honor of <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara,</HI> which are not onely bigger than those erected for lesser Deities, but have also indifferent high Steeples, which the other have not. And because the Disciples of <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara</HI> are scatter'd through the whole Countrey, therefore there is a <HI>Pagode</HI> in every Town, dedicated to these two Deities.</P>

</FIGURE> Day, a great Wonder in the <HI>Pagode Camaet∣sema,</HI> Consort to <HI>Eswara.</HI> On this Day they bring a great quantity of Fruit into the <HI>Pagode,</HI> in which also they place a Child near a deep Pit run∣ning a great way under Ground. In the Evening they lock and seal up the Door of the <HI>Pagode,</HI> lea∣ving onely a Child with a Garland of Flowers about his Neck in the same, which about Mid∣night is with all the Fruits that are in the Tem∣ple fetch'd away from the Pit, and brought again in the Morning, with a new Garland about its Neck.</P>
<P>The Pagode at <HI>Trisinapoli</HI> is become famous by means of an Image, standing in the same, which is said to have worshipp'd <HI>Bramma</HI> in Person as we have already related at large.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Pagodes</HI> of <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara</HI> are of a considerable bigness, being much larger than those of the lesser <HI>Numens,</HI> yet are they not comparable to the Churches of <HI>Europe,</HI> being very low and flat; yet some of them have high Stee∣ples, as amongst others the <HI>Pagode</HI> near <HI>Tegnepa∣tram,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>The White Pagode.</HI></P>
<P>In many places the <HI>Pagodes</HI> are built in the Fields, and are without Windows or Holes, so that no Light comes into them but through the Doors, so that they are generally very dark; they are commonly divided into three Walks, the first being a Vault resting on Stone Columns, into which any one may come, it being always open: In it are several Statues of Elephants, Oxen, Hor∣ses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are us'd in the Service of the Idol, who is often drawn upon them through the Streets of the Cities. The second having a strong Gate, is open onely in the day-time; but the <HI>Brahmans,</HI> who inhabit the same, suffer none to come in thi∣ther, which is generally furnish'd with Images of horrid Shapes as Men with many Heads and Arms. In the third Isle, which is lock'd up with a strong Door, stand the Images of <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara.</HI></P>
<P>They represent their God <HI>Wistnow</HI> or <HI>Mahadeu</HI> (according to <HI>Della Valle</HI>) in the likeness of a small Stone Column, which grows less and less from the bottom upwards. The Name <HI>Mahadeu</HI> a∣mongst the <HI>Indians</HI> signifies properly <HI>Great God,</HI> whose Vertues they highly extol, believing him to be very wonderful, adding moreover, that whil'st he liv'd on Earth, he daily grew bigger and bigger, nay, that his Image still grows greater as it stands in their Temples.</P>
<P>They also represent <HI>Mahadeu</HI> in another Shape, of Crystal, and make Offerings at his Fet, which consist in Milk, Oyl, Rice, and the like. They al∣so represent him like a Man, but having sixteen Arms on each side.</P>
<P>Round about the <HI>Pagodes</HI> is a large inclos'd Plain full of smaller Buildings, serving for their lesser Deities.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Pagode</HI> of <HI>Wistnow, Laetsemi,</HI> Consort to <HI>Wistnow,</HI> hath a Chappel; as also <HI>Garrouda</HI> and <HI>Annemonta,</HI> both faithful Servants of <HI>Wistnow.</HI> The Image <HI>Garronda</HI> is represented like a Man, with Wings; that of <HI>Annemonta</HI> or <HI>Hanneman,</HI> with a Face like an Ape.</P>
<P>On the foremention'd Plains stand Cisterns, in which grows the Herb <HI>Toleje,</HI> which with its use is mention'd before. They never go on these Plains about the <HI>Pagodes,</HI> but always with their right Side towards the Temple.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> account their <HI>Pagodes</HI> to be the Houses and Residences of their Gods, and there∣fore enter into them with great Reverence. Part of the Customs for Goods sold and bought, are bestow'd on them; as also part of the <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and long Pepper, and likewise of all Monies that are Coin'd. They also go in Pilgrimage to the <HI>Pagodes,</HI> and upon certain Feast-days make great Presents and Offerings to them.</P>
<P>The Pagode <HI>Winket Eswara</HI> in the City <HI>Tripeti,</HI> hath yearly three Feafts; one in <HI>September,</HI> at which time great numbers of People flock thither from all parts of the Countrey, especially the <HI>Soudra's,</HI> who commonly carry many Presents with

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> them. The second is in <HI>December,</HI> when the <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> repair thither with Presents; and the third not long after.</P>
<P>By means of the great concourse to this <HI>Pagode</HI> it hath great advantages, amounting to a vast: Re∣venue, which arises wholly from the Presents brought thither, none of the <HI>Heathens</HI> going with empty Hands, but discharging their Promises and Vows there, which they make for the obtaining of Health, or accomplishing any Business.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of worship∣ping <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara.</HI></NOTE>They seldom have any publick Meetings in their <HI>Pagodes,</HI> nor any set-day for Worship, but frequenly carry die Image of <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara</HI> on their Shoulders through the Streets of the City, <HI>viz.</HI> they carry <HI>Eswara</HI>'s about every Month on the <HI>Amawasi,</HI> or first day; and on the ninth day after the new Moon, that of <HI>Wistnow.</HI> They are car∣ry'd after this manner: The Image is plac'd on a woodden Horse, with his fore Feet rais'd, and his hinder Legs standing on a Plank, and so carry'd on the Shoulders of several Men; before the Horse they bear lighted Torches, and <HI>Umbrella's</HI> over its Head; near the Horse stands one who constantly fans the Image, to keep the Flies from it; and when they have done, they return it to the old place in the <HI>Pagode</HI> again, where some ap∣pointed for that purpose, Dance before the Image, whil'st others Sing Anthems in praise of the Idol, playing on Cymbals, and beating on Drums.</P>
<P>It is also a Custom in this Countrey, to devote young Virgins to the <HI>Pagodes,</HI> after which they are bound never to Marry, but spend their Lives onely in Dancing before their Gods, to whom (as they say) it is so acceptable, that they shall merit Heaven by it.</P>
<P>Each Person also according to his Sect, by virtue of their eighth Commandment of internal Religion, studies to do honor to his Idol, bestow∣ing on it all manner of Service which he supposes to be best pleasing to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wistnowa's</HI> strew their Images erected in ho∣nor of <HI>Wistnow,</HI> with Flowers, put rich Clothes on it, adorn'd with Diamonds, Rubies, and other Pre∣cious Stones, thereby to make him appear glori∣ous In the Eyes of all Men. But their God <HI>Eswara,</HI> they affirm, delights in something else, <HI>viz.</HI> to be wash'd constantly with sweet Waters, which his Worshippers are no way negligent in performing, but continually wash the aforesaid Deity with all sorts of perfum'd Waters.</P>
<P>They also carry these Images every year on their Festival days through the most eminent Streets of their Cities, in a Wagon as high and large as an ordinary House; those which draw it are Fishermen, and the like mean People, accom∣pany'd by a a great number of divers Tribes, which is a Custom observ'd through the whole Coun∣trey. The Image of <HI>Wistnow</HI> every year on the tenth of <HI>January</HI> in the afternoon, they carry out of the City into the Fields on a woodden Horse, where they let loose a Ram, which they endeavor to kill as he runs; as also a Fox, which they strive to destroy with their Clubs, but he commonly escapes them. Towards the Evening they carry the Image home again through the Streets, ac∣company'd with abundance of People carrying lighted Torches, and at last set it in the old place. The following day they shew honor to the God <HI>Eswara,</HI> by carrying of his Image into the Fields after the same manner, as also on the twelfth, though not on Horseback, but onely on Mens Shoulders.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that the greatest part of the Service which the <HI>Indians</HI> perform to their Gods, consists onely in Singing, Dancing, playing on Musical Instruments, serving them with Meat, Bathing, Washing, Perfuming them, and the like. Few of them spend their time in Praying or Read∣ing, which as some believe, are onely to bring them to the perfect knowledge of God, to which when they have attain'd, the Books become alto∣gether useless. Some Priests Dance stark naked, before their Idol, excepting a Cloth about their Middle, to cover their Privities, whil'st others

They also worship and make Offerings to <HI>Dewendre,</HI> and other Princes of the lower Region, as <HI>Achni, Wayouvia, Warrouvo, Isan-ja,</HI> and se∣veral others, but erect no Temple to them; <HI>viz.</HI> They Offer <HI>Jagam</HI> to <HI>Indre,</HI> that thereby they may obtain plenty of Meat, Clothes, and Wo∣men. <HI>Achni</HI> they reverence, to procure Fame and Honor; <HI>Warrouva,</HI> that they may have strength and power of Body. From <HI>Cubera</HI> they implore Riches. And from <HI>Isan-ja</HI> they crave Power and Dominion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> affirm, that their worshipping of the inferior Deities is onely advantageous to them in this World; but by the Service perform'd to their supream Gods they merit Heaven; they therefore account it no sin to worship the lesser Deities, provided they adore them not with that zeal as they do their supream, which if they should, they would be guilty of mortal sin.</P>
<P>Some affirm, that there are no <HI>Pagodes</HI> built in honor of <HI>Bramma,</HI> neither is he worshipp'd, not∣withstanding he hath so great a Command a∣mongst them; the reasons thereof the say is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That anciently a Saint commanded that they should erect no Temples of <HI>Bramma;</HI> but others suppose this to be onely a pretence of the <HI>Brah∣mans;</HI> that they themselves may be better and more esteem'd of amongst the People, and have some advantage from them: Yet <HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that there is a <HI>Pagode</HI> built in honor of <HI>Bramma,</HI> in a Village call'd <HI>Agra,</HI> not far from the City <HI>Cambaya,</HI> wherein are erected divers white Marble Images, and in the midst of the <HI>Pagode</HI> the Image of <HI>Bramma</HI> naked, with many Arms, three Faces, and a long picked Beard, but roughly Carv'd; at his Feet stand two other Images of his Children, the one call'd <HI>Savetri,</HI> and the other <HI>Garetri;</HI> and in another corner of the Temple, on the left Hand of <HI>Bramma,</HI> stand two Images more, being the Representations of two of <HI>Bramma</HI>'s Disciples, one call'd <HI>Cheskuer,</HI> and the other <HI>Ciavan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are very zealous in serving their Idols, daily perfuming, washing, and setting Meat before them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They Offer to the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vils</NOTE>According to a Custom us'd anciently by most People, they also worship and make Offerings to evil Spirits, of which the chiefest in esteem are <HI>Ganga</HI> and <HI>Gournatha.</HI> The Image of <HI>Ganga</HI> hath one Head and four Arms; in one of the left Hands it holds a Cup, and in one of the right a Trident. In most parts of the Countrey are <HI>Pagodes</HI> built in honor of this Demon, but none for <HI>Gournatha,</HI> though he is above <HI>Ganga,</HI> and the Son of <HI>Eswara,</HI> notwithstanding the <HI>Wistnowa's</HI> account him a De∣mon; yet nevertheless, though it be not customary, there is a <HI>Pagode</HI> built in honor of him at <HI>Carmellon,</HI> a Place not far from <HI>Paliacatta;</HI> but in the Fields they erect several Images in honor of him, but commonly they worship him under a Tree, where they pretend to have seen him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soudra's</HI> keep a yearly Feast in commemo∣ration of <HI>Ganga,</HI> though at no set-time: The Rice which they Offer to his Image, is boyl'd either in or near the <HI>Pagode</HI> in the forenoon: In the after∣noon the Idol is put into a high Charriot, and con∣ducted through the Streets of the City, where both

</FIGURE> Rich and Poor with folded Hands fell down be∣fore the charriot; against the coming of which several Goats being brought thither to be kill'd for Offerings, have their Heads cut off by the Ser∣vants belonging to the <HI>Pagodes,</HI> who keep the Heads for their own share. Many Goats are kill'd after this manner at this time, for all those that can by any means purchase a Goat, bring him thither to be kill'd: Some also bring three or four, with the Flesh whereof they make merry at night. The Charriot wherein the Idol is plac'd is follow'd by another, on which stands a Gibbet with two Iron Hooks, whereon such as have made any Promi∣ses in sickness or adversity to <HI>Ganga,</HI> suffer them∣selves to be hook'd in at their Backs, and drawn up into the Air, where they Fence with a naked Sword which they hold in their Hands, or else fire off a Gun, and charge the same again; and not onely the Men suffer themselves to bo tortur'd so, but also the Women, professing that they feel no pain thereby; yet for fear, those through whose Bodies the Iron Hooks are driven should cry, and thereby strike a terror to others, the Spectators make a mighty noise, so to drown the cry of them that are tortur'd. It hapned nevertheless on a time, that a Slavess belonging to the Governor of <HI>Palia∣catta,</HI> being perswaded that she should feel no pain, suffer'd her self to be hook'd in her Back, and so drawn up, but confess'd afterwards that she was much deceiv'd, being sufficiently made sensible of the contrary, and therefore would never be per∣swaded to be serv'd so again. Some out of a su∣perstitious zeal to this <HI>Ganga,</HI> suffer themselves to have Holes made through their sides, and a small Cord drawn backwards and forwards through them, not without great pain; which neverthe∣less they regard not, but look cheerfully, and Dance all the time. Others that dwell farther up in the Countrey, likewise superstitiously throw themselves before the Chariot, suffering it to run over their Bodies, and break them to pieces.</P>
<P>In ancient times, as these <HI>Heathens</HI> make men∣tion, they offer'd yearly a Man to <HI>Ganga,</HI> but they say he hath of late been satisfi'd with a Buffalo; but no such bloody Offerings are made to <HI>Wistnow</HI> or <HI>Eswara:</HI> and though this kind of diabolical Worship be very common amogst the <HI>Soudra's,</HI> yet it is not allow'd by the <HI>Brahmans.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Brah∣mans</HI> belief concerning the transmi∣gration of the Soul.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> believe, that each Man hath had a Life before this present, and that that which he meets withal in this, whither good or bad, is either a reward or punishment for his works in the for∣mer, so likewise they maintain, that no Man meets with any reward for his good works in this Life, but is to undergo the punishments inflicted upon him for his sins in his former Life, and that those which do good in this Life, shall meet with a reward proportionable in that to come. And notwithstanding few see any probability by their good works to attain to, or merit <HI>Wemcontam,</HI> that is, <HI>Heaven,</HI> or a place of everlasting happiness, be∣cause that is onely appointed for the faithfullest Servants of <HI>Wistnow</HI> and <HI>Eswara,</HI> and find them∣selves destitute of these Perfections requir'd there∣to, yet they speak much of the forgiveness of sins, and in order thereunto have invented several means whereby they alledge the remission or for∣giveness of sins may be obtain'd; nay, some of them are so superstitiously zealous, that they un∣dertake to do more than their <HI>Vedam</HI> requires of them, meerly out of an ambition to live a more perfect Life, in hopes that thereby they may ob∣tain an extraordinary place in Heaven, and there∣fore many undergo great hardships, torture and punish themselves divers ways; some wearing Iron Collars about their Necks of twenty four pound weight, in form of a Grate four Foot square. Others have Iron Chains made fast about their Legs at one end, carrying the other on their Shoul∣ders. Some also go on woodden Clogs full of Iron Pins, which are so sharp, that it is a wonder how they can go upon them. Many others there are, who chain themselves by the Legs to a Tree, resolving there to end their Lives. Some also
<PB N="151" REF="115"/>lock themselves up in little square Houses, or ra∣ther Cages, built on two Images of the Idol <HI>Ma∣hadeu,</HI> with intentions never to come out of them, notwithstanding they endure great hardship, part∣ly by the heat and smoak of the many Lamps which they burn therein, and partly for the incon∣venience of the Rooms, which are so little, that they can but just sit in them, with their Legs across under them on the Floor. Others hang a conside∣rable time on a cross piece of Timber, by an Iron Hook driven into their Sides, notwithstanding the pain and effusion of Blood, whilst with a Shield and Sword which they hold in their Hands, they Fence in the Air, and Sing Songs in honor of their God. Others wound and kill themselves before the Idols. There are likewise some, who being desirous to go to Paradise, leap into the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> across which they swim several times, in hopes to be devour'd by the Crocodiles. All those People that torture themselves after this manner, are call'd <HI>Fakyrs,</HI> or begging Monks, of which some that go stark naked, neither set nor lay them∣selves down to sleep at no time, but when they will rest themselves or sleep, they tie a Rope to a House or Tree, with a piece of Wood at one end, on which only leaning with their Arms and Head, they sleep.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Places ac∣counted holy, and visited by the <HI>Brahmans</HI> Followers.</NOTE>Besides these means, the <HI>Brahmans</HI> have in∣vented several others for remission of their sins, and to purifie themselves, <HI>viz.</HI> to visit such holy Places as are highly esteem'd amongst them, the chiefest and holiest whereof are six, <HI>viz. Ayot-ja, Matura, Casi, Canje, Awentecapouri,</HI> and <HI>Dwaraweti.</HI></P>
<P>Many things they relate of these Places, <HI>viz.</HI> That all those which die in the <HI>Casi,</HI> shall imme∣diately ascend to Heaven, whether Man or Beast, but those that die in any other of the forementi∣on'd Places, shall go to <HI>Bramma,</HI> and there having stay'd a considerable time, shall return into the World again, to be transmigrated into one or other Body; but if they have liv'd out their time, and have dy'd twice, then they shall go directly to Heaven, and not return again into this World.</P>
<P>They affirm, that it is sufficient for the Vulgar to die onely in the holy Places, from whence they undoubtedly go to Heaven.</P>
<P>These Places have each their Limits, but are not of an equal bigness: for that of <HI>Casi</HI> is but a Mile; that of <HI>Ayot-ja,</HI> twelve Leagues; and not∣withstanding they account it a happiness to die in one of them, yet none are allow'd, out of a long∣ing desire of Salvation, to bereave themselves of life there, except at <HI>Preyaga,</HI> of which more here∣after. As to what concerns these Places in parti∣cular, they are describ'd after this manner:</P>
<P><HI>Ayot-ja,</HI> lying twelve Leagues Northward from <HI>Casi,</HI> was the Birth-place of <HI>Wistnow</HI> under the Name of <HI>Ram.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Matura</HI> near <HI>Agra,</HI> the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Court, <HI>Wistnow</HI> came into the World by the Name of <HI>Cristna.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Casi,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Waranasi,</HI> lying in <HI>Bengala</HI> near the Kiver <HI>Ganges,</HI> twelve Leagues from <HI>Ayot-ja,</HI> and twelve from <HI>Preyaga,</HI> is situate twelve Leagues higher up the <HI>Ganges</HI> then <HI>Casi,</HI> and nearer to the City <HI>Agra,</HI> where three Branches of the <HI>Ganges</HI> uniting, are accounted so holy, that the <HI>Heathens</HI> believe those which die in this Water to be certainly purg'd from their sins; and therefore this Place is very famous amongst them, which in∣deed is no wonder, because (as they say) all those which die there are happy.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Canje,</HI> or <HI>Cansjewaram,</HI> a great and well known City in the Kingdom of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> hath many <HI>Pagodes,</HI> and is therefore accounted very holy.</P>
<P><HI>Awentecapouri,</HI> or <HI>Awenteutica,</HI> is a City lying Northward from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dwaraka</HI> or <HI>Dwaraweti,</HI> formerly lay near <HI>Zur∣ratte,</HI> but is said to have been wash'd away by the Sea. In this Place they relate that <HI>Cristna</HI> dy'd, and that his Body when (according to the Custom of the Countrey) it was going to be burnt, was al∣so wash'd away by the Sea, and driven to <HI>Sjanger∣nata</HI> or <HI>Prousotamai,</HI> a Place near <HI>Bengala;</HI> where∣fore they account the Pagode <HI>Sjangernata</HI> to be very holy.</P>
<P>The visiting of these holy Places extends not onely to the forgiveness of sins, but they also ascribe so great a power thereto, that by the na∣ming of them onely they believe they shall obtain pardon; wherefore Persons of Quality that are religious read over the Names of them every Morning; therefore those that cannot go to <HI>Casi</HI> and other holy Places, content themselves onely with the bare naming of them.</P>
<P>They hold that the keeping of their Feasts, and washing their Bodies with salt Water, also merits remission of sins; also they go in Pilgrimage to the Pagode <HI>Rammeswara,</HI> by the <HI>Malabars</HI> call'd <HI>Rammanatakovil,</HI> partly for the great Sanctity of the Place, and partly because the Sea-water that flows by this <HI>Pagode,</HI> is always clear, and fit to wash in.</P>
<P>The like opinion they have of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and therefore the Inhabitants of <HI>Bengala</HI> which dwell about it, have a Custom to bring all dying Per∣sons thither, and put one half of their Bodies into it to wash away their sins. But all Persons are not permitted to wash themselves therein without paying Tribute to those Kings through whose Countreys the River runs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> derive the Sanctity of this River from Heaven, and confirm their Fancy with many ridiculous Fables, yet they firmly believe the same, because their <HI>Vedam</HI> or Law-book doth con∣firm it.</P>
<P>All the foremention'd ways the <HI>Heathens</HI> pra∣ctise to obtain remission of their sins; and if any chance not to have endeavor'd the same, yet they believe, that their Friends or Relations which sur∣vive may do something for their benefit after Death; particularly, they carry and throw the Bones of the Deceased into the holy River <HI>Gan∣ges,</HI> which they firmly believe will turn much to the Deceased's advantage, who for every year that their Bones lie in the said River, they shall enjoy a thousand years of pleasure in <HI>Dewendre.</HI></P>
<P>Thirty Leagues Southward from <HI>Casi</HI> lies a City call'd <HI>Goya,</HI> where it is said, that God setting his Foot on a great Stone, left the print thereof be∣hind him, which is yet to be seen. Round about this City is a Fort for the preservation of the foremention'd Relick.</P>
<P>Those that go in Pilgrimage to <HI>Preyaga,</HI> com∣monly spend a whole month there, and wash themselves daily before the Sun rises in the River <HI>Ganges;</HI> after the expiration of which they go from thence to <HI>Casi,</HI> where also they spend a considera∣ble time, they come again to <HI>Gaga,</HI> where ma∣king a Paste of fine Flour, they lay several pieces thereof on the foremention'd Stone, naming at the laying down of each piece one of their deceased Friends, who (as their <HI>Vedam</HI> or Law-book affirms)
<PB N="152" REF="116"/>are deliver'd out of <HI>Jamma Locon,</HI> or <HI>Hell,</HI> and con∣vey'd to the place of <HI>Dewendre.</HI></P>
<P>They maintain that the Wicked shall meet with more or less punishment after this Life, ac∣cording to their deserts, and that some after Death are punish'd in this World, and others in some other place.</P>
<P>They also believe, that the Souls of some when they die, transmigrate into other Bodies. Amongst those whose Souls are transmigrated in∣to the Bodies of Beasts, they account those which enter into a Cow the most happy, because of all Beasts that is most acceptable to their God.</P>
<P>Some they believe are for their sins, condemn'd to be evil Spirits, flying up and down in the Air, till the time of their punishment be expir'd.</P>
<P>Those that are not punish'd in the World, are tortur'd in <HI>Jamma,</HI> or Hell, though some are re∣leas'd after the expiration of many years, and co∣ming again into this World, enter into one or other Body; yet some never return from thence, but are for ever punish'd there, <HI>viz.</HI> those that are put into the <HI>Antam Tappes,</HI> that is, <HI>The Pit of Dark∣ness,</HI> out of which none can come, but must remain there for ever, and undergo perpetual torments, the place being full of Thistles and Thorns, Crows with Iron Bills, devouring Dogs, stinging Worms, and all things else to make them miserable.</P>
<P>Moreover they affirm, that there are five deadly Sins never to be forgiven, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. To commit Incest with their Mother, (by the word Mother they not onely understand their natural Mother, but also their Mother-in-law, and the Wife of their Masters or Tutors.) 2. To kill a <HI>Brahman.</HI> 3. To steal Gold. 4. To be a Drunkard; and 5. To converse with them.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the condition of those that are esteem'd happy after Death, they give this Account: That some of them return again to the World, after the expiration of a certain limited time; though others attain a perpetual and ever∣lasting happiness at the first; That such as are or∣dain'd to come a second time into the World, have seven places appointed for them, <HI>viz. Indre-Locon</HI> or <HI>Dewendre-Lokon, Agni-Locon, Niruti-Locon, Wajoiva-Locon, Cubera-Locon, Isanja-Locon,</HI> and <HI>Wasrouna-Locon,</HI> all of them so call'd from the Per∣sons which Govern them. Those which come in∣to these Places, enjoy so much happiness in them, that they wish for no greater, and every one ac∣counts his own Place the best. But besides these seven, which are call'd by the general Name of <HI>Dewendre-Locon</HI> or <HI>Surgam,</HI> there is another call'd <HI>Bramma-Locon,</HI> the place where <HI>Bramma</HI> resides, and is the nearest Heaven: Those which go thither after Death, must after the expiration of some years return again into the World, where having stay'd their appointed time, they certainly go to Heaven, for ever to enjoy all manner of Delights and Pleasures.</P>
<P>Those that inhabit the <HI>Surgam</HI> they name <HI>De∣weta's,</HI> which are of two sorts; some staying there onely for a time, return again into the World, af∣ter which they enjoy all manner of Pleasures.</P>
<P>Other <HI>Deweta's</HI> stay for ever in the <HI>Surgam,</HI> as also the Sun, Moon, Stars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They also beget Children in the <HI>Surgam,</HI> where they affirm no sins are committed, because God himself appearing therein, instructs them. Moreover, the happiest that depart from hence, are those which attain to the <HI>Weicontam,</HI> which is Heaven it self: But the <HI>Brahmans</HI> make mention of two <HI>Weicontams,</HI> a <HI>Lila-Weicontam,</HI> that is, <HI>The Delightful Heaven,</HI> and a <HI>Singel-Weicontam,</HI> where God himself hath his Re∣sidence.</P>

<HEAD>The Religion, Customs, and Constitution of the <HI>Hassenists</HI> or <HI>Moors.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MAny years since the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion was brought by the <HI>Arabians, Persians,</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> into <HI>India,</HI> where it hath got∣ten no small footing, having gain'd many Prose∣lytes, insomuch that most of the Nobility; nay, the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> himself is a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> as also the Kings of <HI>India, Cambaya,</HI> and <HI>Bengala;</HI> which sprang from hence: The <HI>Moors</HI> which were brought as Slaves into <HI>India</HI> after some time making them∣selves Masters of the Countrey, forc'd the Idola∣ters to embrace their Religion. Yet although these <HI>Mahumetans</HI> have the <HI>Alcoran</HI> like the <HI>Turks,</HI> and use it, yet they differ in many-things: for the <HI>Turks</HI> onely worship God and <HI>Mahomet,</HI> but the <HI>Indian Mahumetans</HI> reverence also <HI>Aaly</HI> and his Son <HI>Hassan,</HI> but chiefly <HI>Hassan,</HI> whom they account their chiefest Mediator; yet they agree in all out∣ward Ceremonies of Marriage, Burying, Eating, and Praying, with the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Arabians:</HI> They also go without Shoes into their <HI>Metzids</HI> or Temples, where, when many of them are in com∣pany, they stand in Rows with their Faces towards the South, whil'st the <HI>Molla</HI> or Priest standing be∣fore them, fixes his Eyes on a place in the Walk which hath an Inscription upon it, and shakes both his Arms up and down like a Bird that is going to flie, which all die Congregation imitate in silence; after which the Priest and People falling down on their Knees, bow their Heads down to the Ground, which some kiss, and standing up again, perform the same five several times together; which done, they salute God and their Prophet <HI>Hassan</HI> in these words, <HI>Ssalom Alecum;</HI> then they Pray aloud after the <HI>Molla;</HI> after which some go away again, and others staying in the Temple, discourse one with another about worldly Affairs, as if on an Exchange, and also take Tobacco in the same; to which purpose many carry a Steel, Flint, and Tin∣der, with Pipes and Tobacco at their Girdle. Amongst them are commonly two or three Bar∣bers, who carry Raisins, a Steel Mirror, and a Copper Bason about with them, proffering their Service. Many also as soon as their Service is done in the Temple, go immediately after to the publick Stews, maintaining nevertheless that they are faithful Servants to God and their Prophet.</P>
<P>Some to be reputed zealous, Pray on the Roofs of their Houses.</P>
<P>No Women are permitted to go to their Tem∣ples, but are kept lock'd up in their Houses, so that they neither know nor hear any thing of Reli∣gion, more than what their Husbands acquaint them with.</P>
<P>They Circumcise their Children not before the
<PB N="153" REF="116"/>eighth year, wherein they differ also from the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI> who do it in the seventh, eighth, and ninth years.</P>
<P>They Pray five times every day like the <HI>Turks, viz.</HI> first, two hours before the Sun rises; second∣ly, about noon; thirdly, at four of the clock in the afternoon; fourthly, about six; and fifthly, at nine; at all which times they are summon'd thereto by a kind of Sexton, who cries aloud from the Steeple of their Temples. But for what reason they Pray thus often, they give this ridiculous Tale, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>In the Creation God created <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Light in the shape of a Peacock; which Light God afterwards put into a great white Pearl, hanging it on a Tree, whereby the Creator was magnifi'd above a thousand years; after which God made a Glass of life, and set before <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Peacock, who when he saw his curious shape, worshipp'd God five times; from whence it comes to pass that the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> Pray five times aday; but the <HI>Per∣sians</HI> Pray onely three times.</P>
<P>Amongst these <HI>Hassanists</HI> are also a sort of Monks, who by the <HI>Arabians</HI> are call'd <HI>Derwis,</HI> and by the <HI>Persians, Abdalles;</HI> they agree with those by the <HI>Heathen Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Jogues</HI> or <HI>Jogiis.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Order of the <HI>Der∣wises</HI> amongst the <HI>Hassanists</HI></NOTE>These <HI>Derwises</HI> range up and down through Towns and Countreys, having no setled Residence in any place, but sleep wheresoever they go in the <HI>Metzids,</HI> their Bed being onely a Sheep-skin, which in stead of an upper Garment they wear on their Backs. They are of several Orders, each bearing the Name of their chief Saint, after the same man∣ner as amongst the <HI>Persians.</HI> No Person of whom they Beg, may turn them away without giving them something. They are for the most part inge∣nious and well learn'd in their Books. They stand oftentimes in the Market-places, where calling the People about them, they extol their own Religion, and despise that of the <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI> Some of them scruple not to affirm, that by <HI>Has∣san</HI>'s means (so much interest they are perswaded he hath with God) the Devil may obtain mercy, but not the <HI>Christians,</HI> because they believe not in <HI>Hassein.</HI></P>
<P>Any Man may enter into this Order, as those that cannot live by their Trades commonly do, and under that Name commit all manner of Vil∣lanies: yet some of them voluntarily undergo very great hardships, either living like Hermits on the tops of Mountains overgrown with Trees and Brambles, and remote from all People, where they spend their Lives, without ever stirring from the place where they once seat themselves, except it be to be to disburden Nature, continually saying these or the like words, <HI>I affect You and not the World, I do all this for Your sake, therefore look upon me, O Almighty God.</HI></P>
<P>Those People that betake themselves to this kind of Living, never shave themselves, nor pair their Nails, but let them grow like Claws; they will rather endure hunger, than go out of their Huts; wherefore those that know their Abodes, out of compassion will send them Food and Rai∣ment, which must be of the meanest, or else they will not eat it, and no more than they can eat at once. Some take up a resolution to Fast a certain number of days, and will eat no kind of Meat du∣ring that time, till they have in a manner quite starv'd themselves. Others go stark naked, ex∣cept a Cloth before their Privities, and beg for their Food.</P>
<P>These People by some strange means or other, prognosticate wonderful things, which makes the Vulgar flock about them, and hearken with great earnestness to what they say. There are some some amongst them call'd <HI>Mandees,</HI> who as a pen∣nance for their sins cut and slash their Bodies; and others wear such Chains about their Legs, that they are scarce able to stir, going bare-foot on the hot Ground with blue Cloaks about them in Pil∣grimage, to the Burying-places of their Saints.</P>
<P>There are also a sort of <HI>Jogues</HI> amongst the <HI>Moors,</HI> who (according to <HI>Texeira</HI>) are call'd <HI>Ca∣lendares,</HI> that travel to colder and more populous Countreys, especially through <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Turke∣stan,</HI> and therefore taking greater care of them∣selves than the other <HI>Jogues,</HI> cover their Bodies with Sheep-skins, and also make Stockings and Shoes of them. They also act the parts of Juglers, carrying a green Purse, with Flowers or the like, in their Hands, which proffering to those they meet with, they read some <HI>Arabian</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> Ver∣ses to them, by that means to get some Alms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diet of the <HI>Hassanists</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Hassanists</HI> eat onely once a day, <HI>viz.</HI> about three a clock in the afternoon, not sitting on Stools at high Tables like us, but the Floor, co∣ver'd with a Carpet, serves them not onely for Stools, but a Table also, sitting on the same with their Legs under them; being thus seated, espe∣cially at Feasts, a Servant comes with a Bason and Ewer, and going from one to another, pours out the Water for them to wash their Hands; after which the Meat is brought in Copper Dishes, Tinn'd in the inside, and about three yards in cir∣cumference; they are commonly fill'd with Rice, boyl'd with Butter, Flesh, Onions, Garlick, Pep∣per, Almonds, Raisins, and the like: They often colour their Rice green, yellow, brown, blue, and red, according to the <HI>Persian</HI> way: After the Meat is set before them, they fall to eating thereof, say∣ing no other Prayer but this, <HI>In the Name of God, gracious and merciful,</HI> which words stand before eve∣ry Chapter in the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> They have no Bread, there growing onely a little Wheat, and no Rye in all the Countrey, and therefore eat scalded Rice in stead of Bread. Their Trenchers are Cakes bak'd thin, which many after they have Din'd also eat, or put them up in their Handker∣chiefs.</P>
<P>Their common Drink is Water, which they drink not till after their Meals, when it is brought to every one by a Servant, in a Copper Cup; they never drink standing, but always sitting, ac∣counting it very unwholsom to do the contrary.</P>
<P>After Meals they have again warm Water brought them to wash their Hands; which done, some rise up, and go away without speaking a word, or returning thanks to the Master of the Feast; others, especially if they are Friends or intimate Acquaintance, stay and smoak a Pipe of Tobacco and drink a Dish of Coffee.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Hassanists</HI> are temperate at Meals, yet most of them are inclin'd to Drinking in pri∣vate, and commonly in the Night, that they may not be discover'd; for to be Drunk is accounted an abomination amongst them.</P>
<P>The best Liquor which Persons of Quality drink, is <HI>Persian</HI> Wine; they also drink Spirits, distill'd out of Dates and Sugar; also Palm-Wine, call'd <HI>Terri</HI> or <HI>Tori,</HI> which they drink when fresh tapt out of the Palm-trees.</P>
<P>These <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Hassanists</HI> use the same Funeral Ceremonies as the <HI>Persians, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI>

</FIGURE> <HI>viz.</HI> When a <HI>Hassanist</HI> dies, the Women that are nearest related to the Deceased, as also the Chil∣dren, make a doleful noise, pull the Hair from their Heads, and crying out, ask, <HI>Oh! when did you die? what is the cause of your Death? did you want any thing in your Life?</HI> and the like. The mournful noise is augmented by the coming of the Neighbors, and continues six hours or more, whil'st others set Meat before the dead Corps, and a Feast is pre∣par'd for the Friends; after which the Body, if of a Man, is by three or four Men, carry'd naked to the Water to be wash'd; which done, they cut off the Nails both of the Hands and Feet, and shave the Hair from off the Head and Face; but if it be of a Woman, then it is order'd after the same manner by Women, onely they do not shave the Hair from off her Head; the Corps be∣ing wash'd, they put a clean Shift upon it, as also a Sute of Clothes, and then lay it in an open Chest, which being set on a Bier, is by four Men carry'd to the Grave, whither it is follow'd by three or four <HI>Molla's</HI> or Priests, who Singing or Reading all the way, are follow'd by the nearest Relations and Friends; the Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, or nearest to the <HI>Molla,</HI> wringing their Hands, cry aloud, <HI>Oh, why did you die and leave me so sorrowful, I would fain have dy'd for you, if our Prophet</HI> Hassan <HI>would have permitted me:</HI> Coming to the Grave, the Body is taken out of the Chest and laid into the Grave, Clothes and all, and co∣ver'd with Stones, Mortar, Shells, Flowers, or Moss; and whil'st the Corps is laying in the Ground, and the Grave filling, the By-stauders say several Prayers to themselves; which done, they return all to the House of Mourning, where the Friends staying together, keep the <HI>Molla's</HI> for some time, to Read and Pray for the Soul of the De∣ceased: The day following, two hours before Sun-rising, a great number of Women go to the Grave, loaden with variety of Meats, and several Stone Cups full of <HI>Terri</HI> and Strong-waters, all which they set down by the Grave, and proffer it to the Defunct, beginning also to cry and lament, but all in order, <HI>viz.</HI> four Women begin first, who when tir'd, four more take their places, and after them four more, so continuing round till Sun-set, whil'st those that are weary with lamenting, re∣fresh themselves with eating and drinking; after which going home, they return again in two days, and perform the same Ceremonies; and if the Deceased were a Person of Quality, then their Mourning lasts fourteen days. Their Mourning Habits are blue. They never bury their Dead in the <HI>Metzids,</HI> but without the City in very low Grounds. But Noblemen, and Persons of great Estates make stately Tombs for themselves, which are generally of a great circumference, and sur∣rounded with strong Walls near a Pool of Water; within the Walls they erect small <HI>Metzids,</HI> and close by them the Tombs, which are either built round, square, or with six or eight corners, and co∣ver'd Archwise: The remaining part of the Ground is planted with Fruit-trees and Flowers, just as if they would make the <HI>Elysium</HI> Fields, wherein the Souls may delight themselves; and certainly no Place in all the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Countrey yields more delight than some of these Burying-places; neither do the <HI>Moors</HI> bestow so much Charge or Art in any thing as on their Tombs. Amongst many other stately Tombs, the most fa∣mous is at <HI>Secandra,</HI> a Village lying a small League distant from <HI>Agra,</HI> which was begun to be built by King <HI>Achabar,</HI> who began his Reign about the Year 1560. and was finish'd by his Son, who lies by him: The Materials of it consist of Marble of divers colours, which is so neatly joyn'd together, that it seems to be one intire Stone, built high in the form of a Pyramid, having a large <HI>Metzid</HI> and pleasant Garden, surrounded with Marble Walls adjoining to it.</P>

Their Hair appears for the most part black, of a dark brown, hanging lank and flaggy; white and yellowish Hair they account a sign of Leprosie. Most of them, except the Priests or <HI>Molla's,</HI> shave off their Beards, lea∣ving onely Mustacho's (which they let grow very long,) as also all the Hair from their Heads, ex∣cepting that on their Crowns, which they let grow, because thereby they believe they shall be drawn up to Heaven by <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Terry</HI> tells us, that they keep the Hair of their Mu∣stacho's when they grow old in its natural colour, by combing the same with Cedar Combs; but when Age hath made their Hair so grey that they cannot hide them any longer, they give over sha∣ving of themselves, and let their Hair grow all over their Faces.</P>

Their Shoes made after the fashion of the Countrey, either of Leather or rich Silk, they tread down at the Heels, that they may pull them off with the more ease when they go into their Temples or Houses, or sit down on their Floors, which are cover'd with white Carpets. On their Heads they wear <HI>Turbants</HI> after the <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> manner, generally made of fine white or red Callico, wrought with Silk and Gold, which they never take off when they salute one another. About their Shoulders both noble and ignoble wear in stead of a Cloak, a yellow, red, green, white, or other colour'd Cloth call'd <HI>Pomerys,</HI> a∣gainst the Cold or Rain. About their Middle they wear a Girdle wrought with Gold and Silk, and over it another small white Linnen one plei∣ted.

<HEAD>The Realm of the <HI>Groat Mogol,</HI> otherwise <HI>Hindostan,</HI> or <HI>Indostan.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bounds of the King∣dom.</NOTE>THe Kingdom of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> or <HI>Mo∣gor,</HI> which for its bigness, and Power over the Substitute Kingdoms, deserves the Name of Empire, is on the West bounded by the River <HI>Indus,</HI> and Eastward by the <HI>Ganges;</HI> in the South it verges with one part at the Ocean, and with the other at the Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan</HI> or <HI>Visiapour;</HI> in the North it borders at <HI>Usbeck,</HI> the Mountains of <HI>Tibeth,</HI> and the Kingdoms of <HI>Srina∣gar, Caparangue,</HI> and <HI>Radock;</HI> and lastly, in the East at the Kingdom of <HI>Neckbal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward Terry</HI> makes this Kingdom border in the East at the Kingdom of <HI>Maug,</HI> or <HI>Mavy;</HI> in the West, at <HI>Persia;</HI> in the South, at the Ocean, the Kingdom of <HI>Decan,</HI> and Gulph of <HI>Bengala;</HI> and in the North, at the Mountains of <HI>Caucasus</HI> and <HI>Tartary. Texeira</HI> conterminates the same on one side onely with the <HI>Indus,</HI> and on the other with the <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>According to <HI>Peruschi,</HI> the <HI>Mogols</HI> Kingdom is properly the Main Land lying between the <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges,</HI> just like the <HI>Holy Land</HI> between the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>Others, as <HI>Bulaye, le Gouze,</HI> and <HI>Daviti,</HI> bound this Kingdom in the North at the Countrey of the <HI>Great Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and at <HI>Samarcan;</HI> in the South, at the Kingdom of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> the Gulph of <HI>Bengala,</HI> the great <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, <HI>Diu,</HI> and <HI>Damaon,</HI> both Countreys lying under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> in the East, at the Kingdom of <HI>Pegou, Edrabat,</HI> and <HI>Thebet;</HI> in the West, at <HI>Age∣mistan,</HI> or the Empire of the <HI>Schach</HI> or King of <HI>Persia.</HI> But there can be no certain Boundaries ascrib'd to this Kingdom, because of the continual losing of old, and taking in of new Provinces.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1582. the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Dominions extended Northward to the Mountain <HI>Imaus,</HI> now call'd <HI>Cumae,</HI> which separates the <HI>Mogol's</HI> from the <HI>Tar∣tars;</HI> in the South it border'd at <HI>Calecut,</HI> the Gulph of <HI>Bengala,</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea along <HI>Cambaya;</HI> in the East, at the utmost Borders of <HI>Bengala;</HI> in the West, at the Stream <HI>Indus,</HI> and the Border of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey of the <HI>Mogols,</HI> compris'd with∣in these Bounds (<HI>viz.</HI> from the River <HI>Indus</HI> to <HI>Ganges</HI>) the Ancients call'd <HI>Inward India,</HI> or <HI>India within the Ganges;</HI> otherwise <HI>Indostan,</HI> or <HI>Hindostan,</HI> that is, <HI>The Countrey of the Indus;</HI> for <HI>Stan</HI> signi∣fies <HI>Countrey.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Circum∣ference and Extent.</NOTE>The Circumference of the whole Realm was at that time 900 <HI>French</HI> Miles; the Length, from East to West, 600; and the Breadth, from North to South, 400. Others affirm, That it is at least a thousand <HI>Cos</HI> from East to West; two <HI>Cos</HI> being an <HI>English</HI> League, or three Miles.</P>
<P><HI>Terry</HI> tells, That this Kingdom 1615. had in length, from the North-west to the South-west, above 2000 <HI>English</HI> Miles, and from North to South about 1400, laying the utmost South Point in twenty, and the utmost North Point in forty three Degrees of Northern Latitude: And that the Breadth at that time, from the North-east to the South-west, was about 1500 <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Division.</NOTE><HI>Purchas,</HI> according to the Instructions of Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> divides the Realm of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> in∣to five Kingdoms, the first whereof is call'd <HI>Pen∣gab,</HI> (by <HI>Davity</HI> taken to be the Countrey lying near the River <HI>Hind,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Pangab,</HI> which signifies <HI>Five Waters</HI>) the Metropolis where∣of is call'd <HI>Lahor;</HI> the second <HI>Bengala,</HI> its Metro∣polis being <HI>Sonargham;</HI> the third <HI>Malua,</HI> with its Metropolis <HI>Vagain;</HI> the fourth <HI>Decan,</HI> whose Chief City is <HI>Barampor;</HI> the fifth <HI>Cambay,</HI> with the City <HI>Amadavar. Boterus</HI> maintains, That the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> Governs over forty seven Kingdoms.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Edward Terry,</HI> the <HI>Great Mogol, Anno</HI> 1615. had thirty seven Provinces, anciently peculiar Kingdoms, under his Subjection, the Names whereof, being by him copied out of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Books of Account, are these: <HI>Candahor, Cabul, Multan, Haiacan</HI> or <HI>Bolochi, Buckar, Tatta, Soret, Jesselmeera, Attak, Peniab, Chismeere, Banchish, Jengapore, Delii, Bando, Malway, Gwaliar, Ayra, Sanbat, Bakar, Chytor, Guzarat, Chandis, Berar, Nar∣var, Nagrakat, Siba, Cacares, Gor, Petan, Canduana, Patna, Jesuat, Mevat, Udessa,</HI> and <HI>Prugale.</HI> A Pro∣vince is by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Soubach.</HI></P>
<P>The South side of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Countrey, be∣tween the Bay of <HI>Cambaya</HI> and that of <HI>Bengala,</HI> extends a vast way Southerly, in the form of a Triangle. There are neither Gold nor Silver Mines in <HI>Hindostan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bengala</HI> a fer∣tile and rich Kingdom.</NOTE>The Kingdom of <HI>Bengala</HI> is exceeding fruitful, the whole Countrey being stor'd with rich Com∣modities, as Silk, Cotton, <HI>Indico,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>This spacious Countrey possesses fruitful Plains, and abundance of all sorts of Provisi∣ons; it lying between the two great Rivers of <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges,</HI> which with their Branches wa∣ter the whole Countrey like a Garden; besides many other Rivers, which make this Countrey exceeding fertile.</P>
<P>The Tract of Land from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Brampore</HI> is exceeding pleasant, and full of Rivulets and Springs; but the way from <HI>Brampore</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> is Mountainous, and troublesom for the Camels to Travel; yet it is free from Robbers. The Countrey affords good Wheat, Rice, and Barley, besides many other sorts of Grain, and Bread-Corn, which may be bought, at easie Rates. Of the Wheat, which is fuller and whiter than the <HI>Euro∣pean,</HI> the Inhabitants bake good and savory Bread upon the Lid of a Pot which hangs over the Fire. The Countrey is beautified with many Woods, Orchards, and Gardens: Yet nevertheless, in this vast Tract of Land are many Places which are nothing but sulphureous and unfruitfut Moun∣tains, and therefore uncultivated and desolate.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cambay</HI> to <HI>Lahor</HI> are sandy, barren, and unfrequented Desarts; but twenty Leagues on this side of <HI>Lahor</HI> the Ground is fruitful and fat. There are very few Springs or Rivulets in all this way, and nought but dry Sand, which being often rais'd by impetuous Winds up into the Air, blows into Travellers Eyes, and is ready to smother them, partly by reason of these great Wildernes∣ses, where there is no Provisions nor Water to be had. For fear of robbing, most People in <HI>India</HI> travel in great Companies, which the <HI>Arabians</HI> call <HI>Caravans,</HI> and the <HI>Persians, Cafila,</HI> sometimes to the number of four or five thousand People. <HI>Caravan</HI> in the <HI>Arabick</HI> signifies properly a Com∣pany
<PB N="157" REF="118"/>of Travellers. Out of the whole <HI>Caravan</HI> they chuse a Guide, who, when it is time to pro∣ceed forward on their Journey, beats three times upon a Drum; at the first beating they put up all the Tents under which they sleep in the Night; at the second beating they prepare their Camels and Wagons; and at the third, they set forward. When they travel in the Night, to prevent all Persons from going astray, they give notice by beating on Drums when they shall stand still; as also when they meet with any Water-pits by the way, which sometimes are digg'd above forty Cubits deep, out of which they draw the Water with Oxen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Indostan</HI> sup∣plied with Elephants and Horses from other Parts.</NOTE> There are many Elephants in the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Do∣minions, which are us'd in War, and for other occasions of the King and the Nobility; they also serve them for Carriage, in stead of Camels, of which there are but few. And though the Elephants do not breed here, yet they are brought hither in great numbers from the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala</HI> and <HI>Siam,</HI> and from the Island of <HI>Zeilan.</HI> There are also few Horses or Mules here, but what are brought from <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Arabia.</HI> Those Hor∣ses that breed here, are small, and well-truss'd, like those of <HI>Norway,</HI> fit to carry Loads, like the Asses, of which there are great numbers in the Countrey. There also many Buffaloes, which are put to very hard Work: Their Flesh is not edible; but their Milk is accounted very whole∣som, especially for sick People.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caravanseras,</HI> or Houses of Entertain∣ment.</NOTE>In the Countreys of <HI>Indostan</HI> and <HI>Surat</HI> are no Inns to entertain Travellers, onely in the greatest and chiefest Towns, and in some Villages, are uninhabited Houses, in the <HI>Arabick</HI> call'd <HI>Cara∣vansera's,</HI> that is <HI>Caravan-houses,</HI> otherwise <HI>Ser∣rays,</HI> or <HI>Sarraas,</HI> which are whole Streets and Wards appointed for strange Merchants, and other Travellers, who take up what Rooms they please, and put Locks upon them.</P>
<P>Each <HI>Caravansera</HI> hath a <HI>Backal</HI> or Porter, who at set times every Evening locks up the outward Gates, which are not opened till the Sun rises. This Porter also keeps a Cooks Shop, where Tra∣vellers may either have Meat ready dress'd, or dress it themselves. When they set forward on their Journey again, and leave the Town, they pay a <HI>Jeckas</HI> of Copper for a Beast to carry their Goods, besides their Diet. But in the <HI>Caravan∣seras</HI> which are built in the Countrey, they need not give any thing for their Lodging, whilst the have their Meat from the Porter, but these words <HI>Salom alecun, Peace be with you.</HI> These <HI>Serrays,</HI> or <HI>Caravanser as,</HI> are built by some eminent People, out of Charity, for the accommodation of Stran∣gers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idostan</HI> very rich.</NOTE><HI>Hindostan</HI> possesses great quantities of Gold and Silver, notwithstanding it hath neither Gold nor Silver Mines, but is all brought thither by Stran∣gers, never returning out again: For they melt down the <HI>European</HI> or Forreign Coins, and re∣coin them with the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s, Stamp.</P>
<P>Moreover, all Ships, as well <HI>Indian,</HI> as <HI>English, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which carry Commo∣dities yearly from <HI>Hindostan</HI> to <HI>Pegu, Tanasseri, Si∣am, Zeilan, Achem, Maoassar, Maldives,</HI> and other Places, carry also much Gold and Silver back to <HI>Hindostan;</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> also carry great quanti∣ties of Silver thither from <HI>Japan.</HI> Lastly, for all the Gold and Silver which is transported thither from <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> nothing comes in return thereof from thence but Commodities, the Money being all kept in the Countrey.</P>
<P>They have no Pepper, Copper, Cloves, Nut∣megs, Cinnamon, Lead, Cloth, nor several other Commodities, but what are brought from <HI>Japan,</HI> the <HI>Molucco Islands, Zeilan,</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> Moreo∣ver <HI>Hindostan</HI> is destitute of Fruits, which are car∣ried thither from <HI>Samarcand, Balk, Bocara,</HI> and <HI>Per∣sia;</HI> as Almonds, Apples, Pears, Grapes, Raisins, which are sold all the Winter long at <HI>Dely,</HI> though very dear. They have also from the forementi∣on'd Places several sorts of dry'd Fruits, as Al∣monds, Pistachioes, Nuts, Plums, Apricocks, Raisins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are also little Sea-Cockles taken near the Island of <HI>Maldivia,</HI> which in <HI>Ben∣gala</HI> and other places go currantly for small Mo∣ney. They have also Ambergreece from the same Island, and from <HI>Mozambick;</HI> and likewise Rhinocerots Horns, Elephants Teeth, <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Slaves, Musk, Porcelane, Pearls, besides many other Commodities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indians</HI> manner of Sailing.</NOTE><HI>Texeira</HI> affirms, That the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Ships carry greater Burdens than those of <HI>Europe,</HI> and may be compar'd to those Gallions of the <HI>Grand Sig∣nior</HI> which go from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> but are built after another fashion. They use neither the Compass nor Quadrant; but Sail from <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Persia, Bassora, Mocha, Mozambick, Mombas, Sumatra, Macassar,</HI> and other Places, onely by the help of the North-Star, and the Rising and Set∣ting of the Sun.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabi∣tants of <HI>In∣dostan.</HI></NOTE>There are divers sorts of People in the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Dominions; the Chiefest and most nu∣merous whereof, being the Natives, are <HI>Heathens,</HI> or Idolaters; and next them, the <HI>Moors,</HI> other∣wise call'd <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> from <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Institu∣ter of their Religion; also <HI>Mogols,</HI> or <HI>Mogolleans,</HI> from the <HI>Tartar</HI> Tribe <HI>Mogol,</HI> from which the real <HI>Mogolleans</HI> are deriv'd: for not all those which at this day bear the name of <HI>Mogols,</HI> are extracted from the <HI>Tartar Mogols;</HI> but also those are call'd <HI>Mogols,</HI> who, though <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> are in the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Service, notwithstanding they are <HI>Turks, Persians,</HI> or <HI>Arabians:</HI> But there are generally a hundred <HI>Heathens</HI> to one <HI>Mahumetan.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Indostan</HI> were anciently all <HI>Heathens,</HI> and are generally call'd <HI>Hindoes,</HI> or <HI>Hin∣dous;</HI> but by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders, Indostans.</HI></P>
<P>They shave off all the Hair of their Heads; but the Baldness thereof is not seen, because they always keep them cover'd with <HI>Tulbants,</HI> which they never take off in saluting one another, as we do our Hats.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Manufa∣cture of the Countrey.</NOTE>The Handicrafts Men of this Countrey, though naturally lazy, follow their Employments very close, being either forc'd thereto by necessity, or otherwise; and make Carpets, Embroideries, Cloth of Gold and Silver, and all manner of Silk and Cotton Stuffs, and Linnen, which is worn in the Countrey, and transported to other Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogol</HI> or King is necessitated, by reason of his many Inland and Forreign Enemies, to keep continually a mighty Army, as well in time of Peace as War, a considerable Body whereof are always near his Person, either of Natives, as are the <HI>Rajas</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> which for several Reasons he is necessitated to keep in his Service, as is before mention'd more at large; or chiefly of <HI>Mogollers,</HI> as he himself is, or at least those which are taken for such, though indeed Strangers: For the King's Court is not now, as formerly, all of real <HI>Mogols</HI> deriv'd from <HI>Tartary;</HI> neither are those which officiate in Offices and
<PB N="158" REF="119"/>Places of Honor in the Wars, all of the Tribe of the <HI>Mogols;</HI> but are Strangers, and People of other Nations, most or them <HI>Persians,</HI> some <HI>Arabians,</HI> others <HI>Turks,</HI> of their Children; though the Chil∣dren or the third and fourth Generation of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> before-mention'd, are not so much honor'd and esteem'd as the new-come <HI>Mahume∣tans,</HI> and are but seldom preferr'd to any Degree of Honor, and therefore seem very well satisfied to be ordinary Troopers, or Foot-Soldiers. It is sufficient in these later times for any one to be ac∣counted a <HI>Mogollean,</HI> though he be a Stranger, if he haue but a white Face, and be of the <HI>Mahume∣tan</HI> Religion, to distinguish him from the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are brown, and <HI>Heathens;</HI> as also from the <HI>Christians</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> who are call'd <HI>Franks,</HI> or <HI>Franguis.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is necessitated to keep strange Sol∣diers, that go by the name of <HI>Mogols,</HI> as we said before, because the chief Power of his State con∣sists therein but it stands him in an incredible Charge. The strange Soldiers, as well Horse as Foot, are divided into two Parties, whereof one is continually near him, and the other scatter'd up and down into all the Provinces. In the Troops which attend the <HI>Mogol</HI> are first <HI>Omrah's,</HI> which are the highest Officers; in the second Place, <HI>Mansehdars;</HI> in the third, <HI>Rouzindars.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Omrahs</HI> Children in∣herit not their Fathers E∣states.</NOTE>The <HI>Omrahs,</HI> or Lords of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court, are not, as we might suppose, the Sons of <HI>Omrahs,</HI> or of the House or Family of Noblemen, inherit∣ing their Fathers Estates and Honors, as here, and in <HI>France;</HI> for since all the Lands in the Kingdom are the Kings, it follows, that there are neither Noblemen, nor any other Families, that have Estates in Lands, Goods, or Offices by Inheritance: Insomuch that the Children, or at lest the Ne∣phews of the most powerful <HI>Omrahs,</HI> are after their Fathers deaths reduc'd to great Poverty, and forc'd to List themselves for Common Troopers, under the Command of other <HI>Omrahs.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI> commonly leaves a small part of the Estate to the Widows, and sometimes to the Children: But if their Father lives long, they are oftentimes promoted by him, especially if they are well∣shap'd, handsom-bodied, have white Faces, and, not having gotten too much of the <HI>Indian</HI> Cu∣stoms, pass for real <HI>Mogols:</HI> Though of late this kind of preferring their Children hath been less observ'd than formerly, by reason it is become a general Custom to rise from small Offices to great ones; and accordingly their Pay is more and more advanc'd. Therefore these <HI>Omrahs</HI> are nought but Adventurers, and Strangers of all Nations and Degrees, nay, sometimes Slaves, who going to serve at the Court, are by the <HI>Mogol,</HI> for some or other piece of good Service, promoted to that Degree of Honor, of which they are again be∣reav'd at his pleasure.</P>
<P>Amongst these <HI>Omrahs</HI> are some call'd <HI>Hazary,</HI> others <HI>Dou-Hazary,</HI> and others <HI>Penge Hecht</HI> and <HI>Deh-Hazary:</HI> The King's Eldest Son was also a <HI>Dovazdeh Hazary,</HI> that is, A Lord or Commander over 10 or 12000 Horsemen.</P>
<P>The number of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> reckoning as well those which are scatter'd up and down in the seve∣ral Provinces, as those which attend at Court, is very great, and not justly to be set down: At the Court are generally from 25 to 30000.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Office and State of an <HI>Omrah.</HI></NOTE>These <HI>Omrahs</HI> attain to the chiefest Places at the Court, and Offices in the Army; and are ac∣counted the Supporters of the Realm, and Splen∣dor of the Court. They never come into the Street but in very rich Apparel, riding either on Elephants, Horses, or in a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> and attend∣ed by a great number of Horsemen, which keep Guard before their Houses, besides several Foot∣men, who going before, and on each side of them, make room, and by fanning them keep off the Wasps, Flies, and Dust, with the Wings of Pea∣cocks.</P>
<P>All those that are at Court, are bound, on pain of forfeiting some of their Sallary, to appear twice a day before the King, when he sits on his Throne; or else visit him every Morning at ele∣ven a Clock, and every Evening at six. Moreo∣ver they are oblig'd to watch once a Week in the Castle by turns, for the space of twenty four Hours; and therefore carry their Beds, Carpets, and other Houshold-stuff with them; the King providing nothing for them but meat, which they receive with great Ceremony; <HI>viz.</HI> they bow three times with their Faces towards his Cham∣ber, first holding their Hands over their Heads, and next on the Ground.</P>
<P>They are also oblig'd to attend on the King to all Places, when he goes abroad, what Time or Weather soever it be, either in <HI>Palanquins,</HI> on Elephants, or on <HI>Tacravans</HI> or Thrones, carried each of them on eight Mens Shoulders. Yet ne∣vertheless the King favors some, by reason of their peculiar Offices, their Age or Indisposition, or to avoid too great Attendance, as he doth com∣monly when he goes a Hunting, or to some Ban∣quetting-house near the City, or rather when he goes into his <HI>Mosque;</HI> for then he takes no other with him than those that have the Guard that day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Manseb∣dars.</HI></NOTE><HI>Mensebdars</HI> are Officers of those Troops <HI>Manseb,</HI> and have a competent Salary, yet not comparable to that of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> but exceeding those of inferior Degrees; and therefore they are accounted little less than <HI>Omrahs,</HI> being in the degree of those which are next to that Prefer∣ment; and the rather, because they acknowledge no Superior but the King, and are in general oblig'd to do all things which the <HI>Omrahs</HI> do: nay, they would be perfect <HI>Omrahs,</HI> had they but a considerable number of Horses under their Command; but they have onely six, which wear the King's Badges, and their Salary also is gene∣rally no more than from five to seven hundred <HI>Ropies</HI> a Month. The number of them being un∣limited, is far greater than that of the <HI>Omrahs;</HI> for at the Court are generally 2 or 300000, be∣sides those that are up and down amongst the Ar∣my in the several Provinces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Rouzin∣dars.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Rouzindars</HI> are also Horsemen, but in Pay onely for a day, as the Word signifies: Yet ne∣vertheless it is often far greater than that of most of the <HI>Mansebdars;</HI> but not in that Quality, nor yet so Honorable. The number of these People is very great; but they perform small Offices: for most of them are Secretaries, Clerks, and Seal∣ers of <HI>Barattes,</HI> or Bonds.</P>
<P>The Common Troopers are under the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> the chiefest whereof, and those that receive most Pay, are such as keep two Horses, which are mark'd with the Arms of their <HI>Omrahs.</HI> Their Pay is not limited, but is left to the discretion and generosity of the <HI>Omrah,</HI> who can pay them as he pleases; though, according to the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Order, their Pay is no less than 25 <HI>Ropias</HI> a Month, or thereabouts; and at that rate he reckons with the <HI>Omrahs.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Infantry.</NOTE>The Salary of the Footmen is less. They are generally Musquetiers, but very unexpert; for when they discharge, they sit on the Ground, and rest their Piece on a Stick, being always fearful of burning their great Beards and Eyes, and lest one or other <HI>Dogen,</HI> or Evil Spirit, might make their Musquets fly to pieces: Yet some of them have twenty <HI>Ropias,</HI> others fifteen, and some but ten. There are, nevertheless, some Musquetiers and Gunners who have great Pay, especially the <HI>Franks</HI> or <HI>Christians,</HI> as <HI>English, French, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who deserting the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Service, went over to them from <HI>Goa.</HI> Before the <HI>Mogols</HI> knew the Use of Great Guns, they gave very great Pay to the foremention'd Gunners to instruct them; nay, there are some who to this day have 200 <HI>Ropias</HI> a Month, though the com∣mon Pay for a good Gunner is but 52. Their Guns are of two different sorts the first great and heavy, the second light. Some of their heaviest Guns must be drawn by 20 Pair of Oxen, besides Elephants to help them, by turning the Wheels of the Carriages round with their Trunks, when they come into bad Way, or go up a Hill.</P>
<P>When King <HI>Oranchzef, Anno</HI> 1662. March'd with his whole Army to <HI>Caximir,</HI> one of his Nor∣thern Provinces, to spend the Summer there, he carried 70 great Copper Guns with him, besides 2 or 300 small Field-pieces, which were carried on Camels Backs; and 50 or 60 little Brass Guns, mounted on handsom Carriages, each drawn by two brave Horses, adorn'd with red Flags, and driven by the Gunner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His whole Military Strength computed.</NOTE>The Militia which is kept abroad, differs no way from that which is kept by the King; there being <HI>Omrahs, Mansebdars, Rouzindars,</HI> common Troop∣ers, and Footmen, in all Places: Neither is there any difference but in the number; for the Soldi∣ers which are kept abroad are very numerous. The Army which the <HI>Mogol</HI> is oblig'd to keep constant∣ly in <HI>Decan</HI> only, to curb the mighty King of <HI>Gol∣conda,</HI> and the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> with all their Assistants, is seldom less than about 25000 Horse The Kingdom of <HI>Cabul</HI> requires, for its usual pre∣servation against the <HI>Persians, Augans, Balouchs,</HI> and other People which inhabit the Mountains, 12 or 13000 Horse: the Kingdom of <HI>Caximir,</HI> above 4000; and the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala,</HI> many more. So that the number of the Horse which are really kept always by the King, with the Horse of the <HI>Rajas</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> amounting to 35 or 40000, ad∣ded to those which are abroad in the Field, will be found to be about 200000. The Foot, as we said before, is of little consequence; for those which the King keeps by him, with the Musque∣tiers and Gunners, will scarce amount to 15000: from whence we may judge of the number which may be abroad in the Field-Army. Wherefore the great numbers of Foot which some affirm to be in the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Army, cannot be well apprehend∣ed, unless they take in all those Sutlers or Trades∣men which follow the Army, which being rec∣kon'd up together with the Soldiery, they may then account near 300000 Men in the King's Ar∣my onely, and especially when he hath been long out of his Metropolis.</P>
<P><HI>Pyrard</HI> affirms, That the <HI>Mogol</HI> is able in a short time to bring 300000 Elephants, 80000 Horse, and 200000 Foot, which are generally kept with∣in five Leagues from the Place of his Residence, into the Field.</P>
<P>When any come to speak with the King, either about State or other Affairs, they are conducted by the first Watch they meet withal to the second, and so from one to another, till they come to the Royal City, where they are presented to those whose Office it is to receive them: But the first Watch, which conducts them to the second, takes from the Commander of that Guard a Receipt for their delivery, as also he from the third, and so likewise the rest: And by this means they have certain knowledge of all Persons that pass and repass.</P>
<P>The Kings Militia or Army with which he in
<PB N="160" REF="120"/>Person march'd into the Field <HI>Anno</HI> 1630. to pur∣sue the fled Duke <HI>Chaen Chan,</HI> consisted of 154500 Horse, besides many Camels, Elephants, Mules, and other Beasts of Burthen; yet nevertheless there remain'd 62400 Horse in Garison at <HI>Barampour.</HI></P>
<P>According to a Custom amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> no Person may use any other Arms than what he hath been train'd up to, nor change them, though in the Wars; from whence it happens, that there are Soldiers which fight onely with the Sword, others with Sword and Shield, some with a Lance, others with Bowes and Arrows, and others with Musquets; and so likewise every one with such Weapons as he hath been ever us'd to: which makes them to be very expert and undaunted in any Engagements.</P>
<P>Most Troopers wear two great Tassels made of fine white Hair of certain wild <HI>Indian</HI> Oxen, which are highly esteem'd) fastned behind to the Saddle-tree, and also two more before at the Pum∣mel, and two on the Rains, near the Bit or Curb; so that each Horse hath six of them.</P>
<P>The Horsemen ride half naked; nor do the foremention'd Tassels any way trouble the Rider, but swing to and fro with the moving of the Horse, in such manner that at a distance they seem like Wings.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> punishes all Persons that do not be∣have themselves valiantly, or that deal treache∣rously in the Wars, after a severe manner.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1646. the third of <HI>February,</HI> two <HI>Chans, Hassan Aly,</HI> and <HI>Sahad Chan,</HI> were, for surrendring the Fort <HI>Darund</HI> to the <HI>Usbecan Tartars,</HI> con∣demn'd to die a miserable death, <HI>viz.</HI> to be flea'd alive, to the great sorrow of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>One of the King's Eunuchs, an intimate Friend to one of these <HI>Chans,</HI> being assur'd that they were necessitated, for want of Provisions and Supplies, to surrender the Fort, deliver'd a Peti∣tion to obtain their Pardon from the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> who was so inrag'd thereat, that he immediately caus'd the Eunuch's Head to be cut off, none be∣ing allow'd to intercede for those with whom the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> is displeas'd.</P>
<P>The Skins of the foremention'd <HI>Chans,</HI> being stuff'd, were hung on a high Pole erected near the <HI>Maidan,</HI> and their Flesh thrown to the Dogs: Soon after which, the King caus'd their Wives and Children to be Beheaded, and sent out Sol∣diers to kill their Relations which dwelt up and down in the Countrey; which was accordingly perform'd, and their Heads brought before the King.</P>

<P>Others affirm, That the City <HI>Agra</HI> is the Chief Residence of the King in the Winter; besides which, he hath several other Towns and Fortresses wherein he resides in the Summer Season, <HI>viz.</HI> from the latter end of <HI>March</HI> till the beginning of <HI>August,</HI> sometimes at <HI>Gasmir,</HI> sometimes at <HI>Cabul,</HI> and sometimes in <HI>Mandoa.</HI></P>

On that side which is towards the City it hath a Gate or Entrance, be∣fore which is a spacious Quadrangular Plain, on which the most eminent Traders keep their Shops. On each side of the Gate is a huge Ele∣phant cut in Stone, where stand several Cen∣tinels.</P>
<P>About half a Mile inwards from the Gate, you come to the <HI>Namchas,</HI> or the Court where the King appears daily to his Subjects, which being a large Place, is built round with Lodgings for the <HI>Amurouwen</HI> or Nobles, who stay in them till the King comes to his Throne, when every one of them must appear before him, standing in their se∣veral Places.</P>
<P>The King's Throne is first encompass'd with a large Wooden Rail, within which stand all the Servants with Wooden Clubs; and within this Rail is another of Silver, about which stand the Kings Guards clad in red Cloth embroyder'd with Gold, and Arm'd with Swords, Shields, and Sil∣ver Truncheons. Within this Rail lie many rich Golden Quilts. In the midst of the Square stands the Throne, rais'd about a Mans height from the Ground, and is of massy Gold, emboss'd with Pre∣cious Stones, and richly enamell'd.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Kings Attendance at Court, it is very Magnificent, and exceeds all the other Eastern Princes. The Persons which wait upon him daily are 12000 in number, besides 1200 Concubines, and 600 Eunuchs, which he buying as Slaves, trains them up in all manner of Warlike Exercises, so to enable them to serve him on any occasion.</P>

<P>Next a Tygar being let in, a strong Person en∣tred the Lists to encounter him; but the Tygar being too subtil and nimble, leap'd suddenly upon him, first tearing out his Throat, and afterwards his whole Body.</P>
<P>In the third place, a little Man of mean aspect entring the Lists, ran undauntedly like a Mad-man to the Tygar, and at the first Encounter cut off both his fore Feet, which forcing him to fall, he gave him his mortal Wound: Whereupon the King calling to him, ask'd him his Name; he answer'd, <HI>Geiby;</HI> then the King immediately or∣der'd one of his Servants to carry him a Cloth of Gold <HI>Cambay,</HI> or Coat, who when he deliver'd it to him, said, <HI>Geiby, receive this Coat, which the</HI> Mo∣gol <HI>of his Bounty hath sent you.</HI> He receiving the Coat with great humility, kiss'd it seven times, pressing it each time upon his Eyes and Breast, and soon after holding it up, Pray'd to himself for the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s prosperity; which done, he cry'd aloud, <HI>God grant the</HI> Mogol <HI>to grow as great as</HI> Tamerlane, <HI>from whom he is deriv'd, may he live</HI> 700 <HI>years, and his Generation continue for ever:</HI> No sooner had he utter'd his Wishes, but he was conducted by an Eunuch to the King, and coming near the place where his Majestry sat, he was receiv'd by two <HI>Chans,</HI> and brought before him to kiss his Feet, and at his going away the King said to him, <HI>Be prais'd,</HI> Geiby Chan, <HI>for your heroick Exploit; this Name you shall keep for ever; I am your favora∣ble Lord, and you my Vassal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> also keeps several tame Lions, which walk up and down peaceably like Dogs at the Court amongst the People, never hurting any; yet they have Keepers that always have an Eye over them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> possesses an incredible and unvalua∣ble Mass of Treasure, having (according to report) in ready Money in his Treasury, seventeen <HI>Caroor,</HI> or <HI>Caroras,</HI> each <HI>Carora</HI> being a thousand Tun of Gold, besides Jewels and other Rearities. <HI>Purchas</HI> affirms the Revenue of his whole Realm to amount to fifty <HI>Crous Ropias,</HI> or five thousand <HI>Lecks,</HI> that is seven Millions and a half yearly of <HI>English</HI> Money.</P>

<P>In <HI>Lahor</HI> is another very rich Treasury.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> keeps a great part of his Riches in six strong Castles, <HI>viz.</HI> in that of <HI>Agra, Guallier, Ra∣tomboe, Hassier,</HI> and <HI>Boughtaz.</HI> His Throne in the Royal Metropolis <HI>Lahor</HI> is of massie Gold, Inlay'd with Precious Stones, and richly Enammell'd. Likewise the Throne at his Court in <HI>Agra,</HI> which <HI>Schach Selim</HI> made, is beset with Precious Stones and Pearls, worth many Millions. The Architect of this last was one <HI>Augustine Hiriart</HI> a <HI>Frenchman.</HI></P>
<P>All the Ground and Land of the whole Coun∣trey is the Kings own, so that no Man possesses a Foot of Land but through his favor.</P>
<P>The King gives to each of his Commanders and Grandees that are in his Countrey, certain Lands, Lordships, and Revenues; for which they are oblig'd (excepting onely one Third, which is the Kings) to maintain a certain number of Sol∣diers, as well in time of Peace as War, as also some Elephants, Horses, Camels and Leopards.</P>
<P>When a Nobleman dies, all his Goods, not onely what was given him by the King, but also what he purchas'd himself, falls again to the <HI>Mo∣gol,</HI> who commonly leaves their Widows the Horses and Housholdstuff, and gives to the Chil∣dren some Place of note: for if a Father Com∣manded over a thousand Horse, he will make the Son Commander over fifteen hundred, and after∣wards increase or decrease his number, according to his Deserts.</P>
<P>The King's Treasure is not a little increas'd by the many Presents which are made to him; for none, whether Stranger or Subject, may appear before him without a Present, especially on <HI>Neu∣ruz,</HI> or <HI>New-years-day:</HI> for then rich Presents are sent him from all parts of his Dominions. They make their Presents with great Ceremony and Cost, some giving ten, nay, a hundred and twenty thousand pound <HI>Sterling</HI> worth in Jewels.</P>
<P>Moreover, he receives Custom from the Com∣modities of his Countrey; and causes all Travel∣lers to pay Toll at every Town through which they pass.</P>

<P>THe Weight in <HI>Zurratte</HI> being all of one sort, is call'd <HI>Mao,</HI> that is, <HI>A Hand,</HI> with which they weigh Butter, Flesh, Sugar, Indigo, Wood, Salt, and the like, each <HI>Mao</HI> con∣taining forty <HI>Ceer,</HI> that is thirty pound and a half <HI>English,</HI> and a <HI>Ceer</HI> eighteen <HI>Peyses</HI> (a sort of Cop∣per Money like our Farthings) each <HI>Peyse</HI> weighing three quarters of a pound <HI>Troy</HI> weight.</P>
<P>In Measuring they use two sorts of Ells, nine∣teen of the biggest making about seventeen Yards and a half. The least differ onely an Inch from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ell, or three quarters of a Yard.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> Coins several sorts of Money in di∣vers places of his Dominions, <HI>viz. Mamoedys</HI> and <HI>Ropias,</HI> both of Silver. The <HI>Mamoedys,</HI> which are Coin'd in <HI>Zurratte</HI> of course Silver, are worth about an <HI>English</HI> Shilling, and go currant onely in the Towns of <HI>Brochia, Cambaya, Brodera,</HI> and <HI>Zurratte.</HI> The <HI>Ropias,</HI> otherwise <HI>Ruky, Rupias,</HI> and <HI>Copias Chagamy,</HI> make each 2 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> they are good Silver, and pass through all <HI>Zuratte.</HI> There are also <HI>Tols, Savoys,</HI> and <HI>Jagaries;</HI> the <HI>Tols</HI> make each a silver <HI>Ropia,</HI> and ten <HI>Tols</HI> a golden <HI>Ropia;</HI> a <HI>Savoy</HI> is one <HI>Tol</HI> and a half, and five <HI>Jagaries</HI> six <HI>Tols.</HI></P>
<P>On the Coast of <HI>Cormandel</HI> is a Coin call'd <HI>Pa∣gode,</HI> from an Idol which is stamp'd on the same, and goes for 7 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> There is likewise a Coin call'd <HI>Fanos,</HI> of ordinary Gold, which are pieces like the Scales of Fish, and go for Five-pence-halfpeny.</P>
<P>Their small Money being of Copper, is call'd <HI>Peysa,</HI> and resemble our Farthing, but are heavier according to the common Accompt, ten Peny Weights; five or six and twenty of them make a <HI>Mamoedye,</HI> and three or four and fifty, a <HI>Ropia.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, Almonds in the Shells pass for Mo∣ney, thirty six of them making a Copper <HI>Peysa,</HI> as also a sort of Cockles with a black Speck, in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Cauries,</HI> which are found on the Shore along the Sea-coast, eight whereof make a <HI>Peysa.</HI></P>
<P>There are also <HI>Laryns,</HI> a <HI>Persian</HI> Coin, of good fine Silver, of an oval fashion, each worth 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI></P>

<P>There are likewise Ducats, which are carry'd thi∣ther from <HI>Venice, Turky,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> each worth eight or nine <HI>Mamoedies. Spanish</HI> Ryals and Rixdollars go commonly for five, and the <HI>Lyon</HI>-Dollars

<P>There is also another sort of Coin call'd <HI>Jeckas</HI> or <HI>Jeckai.</HI></P>
<P>The Money of this Countrey doth not always bear one Price, but rises and folls very often, ac∣cording to the Exchange, in which many <HI>Benjans</HI> drive a vast Trade to their great advantage, for they buy all the Gold and Silver upon the coming of the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and other <HI>European</HI> Ships, and the <HI>Moors</HI> Vessels from <HI>Aden</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> when commonly they are at the lowest, and afterwards raise the Money when any quantity is to be sent up to the places lying up in the Countrey.</P>
<P>All the Gold and Silver, both Coin'd and un∣coin'd, which is brought thither out of other Countreys, is melted and Coin'd into Money, stamp'd with <HI>Persian</HI> Characters, expressing the Name and Dignity of the Kings. But there is great deceit in this Coin, wherefore in many pla∣ces and corners of the Streets sit <HI>Benjan</HI> Exchan∣gers of Money, call'd <HI>Parastes,</HI> who for a small Reward looking upon the Money, try the same with such nimbleness and exactness, that they di∣stinguish all the good from the bad, so that few receive any Money without shewing it to these <HI>Parastes,</HI> who are oblig'd, after it hath been shewn to them, if there be any clipt or nought amongst it, to make it good; but this seldom happens, be∣cause they are very exact in the telling and look∣ing of it over. They reckon great Sums by <HI>Crous,</HI> otherwise <HI>Carroras</HI> or <HI>Caroor,</HI> and by <HI>Lecks,</HI> though there be no Coin of so great a value, a <HI>Carrora</HI> be∣ing a hundred thousand Tun of Gold, or (as others affirm) a hundred <HI>Lecks,</HI> a <HI>Leck</HI> being a hundred thousand <HI>Ropias.</HI> They reckon also with uncoin'd Gold, or other precious things, by a certain Weight call'd <HI>Barman</HI> or <HI>Maun,</HI> which is fifty five pound <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Tra∣velling.</NOTE>They travel on Horseback, Mules, and Camels, both Men and Women, as also in Coaches or Chariots. The Grandees use Elephants and <HI>Pa∣lakins,</HI> which are carry'd on the Shoulders of se∣veral Men, especially Noblemen and Persons of Quality, who account it a great Disgrace to go on Foot.</P>
<P>In <HI>Zurratte</HI> and several other Places in <HI>India,</HI> and most part of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Countrey, they travel in a pretty sort of Chariots with two Wheels, the bottoms whereof are square, and rais'd very high from the Ground above the Wheels; there are no Seats in the same, but they sit on the Floor after the Eastern manner, with their Legs across un∣der them; both before and behind are Cushions to lean against. These Chariots are very like those us'd by the ancient <HI>Indians,</HI> and mention'd by <HI>Strabo;</HI> they are for the most part us'd in the Plain-Countrey, to travel withal from one Town to another, and also to ride abroad in for Recrea∣tion, they being very light and easie: When they come to a bad Way or Hills, they take out their Oxen and the Wheels from the Chariot, which also, if occasion require, may be taken in two pie∣ces, and with ease carry'd by two Men on the top of a Mountain or Hill, and put together again when they are past the troublesom Way. After our manner of sitting, two would scarce be able to sit in one of these Chariots, but after the <HI>Indian</HI> manner, four with ease. They are drawn by Oxen in stead of Horses, two to each Chariot, generally fastned to the Axletree, which is made like a Yoke. These Oxen are of a curious shape and colour; the best are generally white, and some speckled black; they are very slender, and have on their Shoulders towards their Necks, a Bunch like the Camels; they trot and gallop as fast as Horses, and are able to travel thirty five or thirty six Miles in a day; they are guided by a Cord, run through Holes made in their Noses, and are as easie to be commanded therewith as Horses.</P>
<P>These Oxen, which are kept by Noblemen, have rich Furniture, their Bodies being cover'd with Crimson Foot-Clothes, Edg'd with yellow
<PB N="165" REF="124"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Fringe, and about their Necks silken Collars, with twelve Bells or more; some also have their Horns tipt with Copper or Silver.</P>
<P>In like manner the Chariots are neatly adorn'd with the like crimson Cloth, or else with Velvet.</P>
<P>When any Women ride in these Chariots, they shut them close round about to keep them from being seen.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality, who are allow'd to use Elephants, travel on them in little Towers, which are like Bedsteads, hung round with Cloth of Gold and Silk; they stand longways cross the Beast, and are so long, that a Man may easily lie at his full length in them; but the breadth is such, that two can but just lie together side by side.</P>
<P>They also use these kind of Towers on Ele∣phants in the Wars, placing nine or ten Musquet∣teers or Bowemen in them, according to the man∣ner of the Countrey: He that guides the Ele∣hant sits stradling upon his Neck, and governs him not with a Bridle, but with a sharp Iron Hook, with which he pricks his Ears, Mouth, or any other part.</P>
<P>The <HI>Palakins,</HI> being like little Beds cover'd with Cloth, are carry'd by four or six Men, with a great Cane, which reaching from one end to the other, lies on their Shoulders: These Bear∣ers go not on the sides, but two before and two be∣hind. This way of being carry'd is very easie and common in <HI>India,</HI> insomuch that all <HI>Europeans,</HI> when they travel, are carry'd after this manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Musick</NOTE>The common Musick of the <HI>Indians</HI> is very un∣pleasing, consisting onely in making of a strange noise. But they have amongst them an Instrument not altogether unharmonious, which is made of two black varnish'd Globes of Wood, with Holes through for the sound to pass through. These two Globles are fastned to both ends of a little Board about three spans long, on which are strung several Brass or Copper Wyres, which are supported in as many places as there are Notes in the Tune which they intend to play. The Musi∣cian playing with his right Hand, takes away the Supporters of the Strings with his left when he pleases to alter the Notes, though not with his Fingers, but with certain Iron Wyres made fast to little Rings, which he moves on the ends of his Fingers, with which striking gently on the Strings, he makes a pleasant noise. For the more ease in playing, the Musician hangs this Instrument a∣bout his Neck, and holds it before him like a Lute.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> also have Flutes, so big, that an Elephant carrying one on each side, and an <HI>Indian</HI> in the middle, hath a sufficient Load. They have also Trumpets of a vast bigness.</P>
<P>Many of the Sea-bordering Places of <HI>India</HI> are at present under the Subjection of the <HI>English, Hol∣landers, Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who there pos∣sess several Towns, Forts, and Factories, for the accommodation of Trade.</P>
<P>The greatest Monarch which is at present in <HI>India,</HI> is call'd, <HI>The Great Mogol</HI> (and not <HI>Mogor,</HI> as <HI>Boterus</HI> and other Geographers have wrongly pro∣nounced) because he possesses the greatest part of <HI>India,</HI> which is the most considerable part of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Officers of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court.</NOTE>The chief Offices and Employments at the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI>'s Court, are officiated by Eunuchs. His first and prime Councellor, is the Visier, or chief Chancellor of the Realm, who Commands like a Vice-Roy, hearing and determining all grand Causes that are brought before the <HI>Mogol.</HI> But though this Chancellor's Honor be very great, yet he is in continual danger of his Life, as may ap∣pear by several Examples, of which this is one: A certain Chancellor perswading his King not to War against <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> was flea'd alive.</P>
<P>Next to the first Visier is the <HI>Wasanbasi,</HI> or Trea∣surer, who keeps one and twenty sworn Secreta∣ries, who attend every forenoon with their Books before the <HI>Corchana,</HI> or Treasury, keeping an exact Account of all things that come in or go out of the same. The Accompts being adjusted,
<PB N="166" REF="125"/>are Sign'd by the <HI>Mogol</HI> himself, the first Visier, Treasurer, and <HI>Diwanbeck</HI> or Judge. This Officer being one of the powerfullest of all those that be∣long to the King, is commonly clad in a long Coat of Cloth of Tissue. He is often carry'd in a <HI>Palakin,</HI> with four silver Scepters and ten Stan∣dards before him, all Men shewing as much ho∣nor to him, as to the King himfelf.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Execu∣tion of Cri∣minals.</NOTE>The third Person of Quality in order is the prime Judge, who Condemns and Examines all Criminals, who are not Executed by a com∣mon Executioner, but by one of the People that are present when they receive their Sentence, who willingly perform the Office. If any Person have committed Murder, he is deliver'd into the hands of his Relations, who Execute him accord∣ing to the Sentence pass'd upon him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Guard.</NOTE>The next Person in order, is a <HI>Rassy</HI> or <HI>Ragia,</HI> who Commands twelve thousand Slaves, who always are at or about the Court at <HI>Lahor</HI> or <HI>Agra,</HI> and are as the King's Guard, travelling with him wheresoe're he goes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nassire,</HI> or King's Steward, is also in high esteem, and provides all Necessaries and Provisi∣ons for the Court.</P>
<P>The Nobles that attend upon the King, are styl'd <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and receive a Sallary from him, more or less, according to the number of Horse they Command.</P>
<P>Besides these <HI>Omrahs</HI> there are several eminent Lords, call'd <HI>Chans,</HI> or <HI>Ragias,</HI> who are always near the <HI>Mogol,</HI> and wait upon him with great hu∣mility, though not without fear, for he that is in favor one hour, often chances the next to be in high displeasure, and danger of losing his Life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Or∣ders of <HI>Chans.</HI></NOTE><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that there are three prime Persons in the Realm, who are next to the King; the first whereof is call'd <HI>Chan Chanon,</HI> that is, <HI>Chief of Nobles,</HI> or <HI>Lord of Lords;</HI> for <HI>Chan</HI> pro∣perly signifies <HI>Lord.</HI> The second bears the Name and Quality of <HI>Mir Miron,</HI> or <HI>Emir Emirs,</HI> which signifies also <HI>Lord of Lords,</HI> though in a meaner sence than the former. The third is the <HI>Chani Alem,</HI> that is, <HI>Chan,</HI> or <HI>Prince of the People.</HI></P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Commanders are <HI>Quizil∣bascies</HI> from <HI>Persia,</HI> who (constrain'd by poverty) forsaking the King of <HI>Persia</HI>'s Service, offer them∣selves to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> where they generally come to great Preferment.</P>
<P>Besides these there are several other Officers and Magistrates, who hear and determine Causes, and pronounce Sentence <HI>verbatim</HI> and not in wri∣ting: for they having no written Laws, not onely the King's word is absolute, but also his Gover∣nors, being authoriz'd by him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King sits in Person in Court.</NOTE>Once a week the King sits in Person in open Court, and passes Sentence on Criminals, and al∣so gives Judgment in Civil Causes.</P>
<P>It is not the practice of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> to strangle his Brothers, or put out their Eyes, when he comes to the Crown, as is usual with several of the Eastern Princes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Variety of punishment for Crimi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></NOTE>Criminals are punish'd several ways, some they sew up in an Ox or Asses Hide while it is moist, that when drying it comes to shrink, it may crush them to death. Some they condemn to go through every Street in the City with Oxes Horns on their Heads. Some they deoculate; Poyson some, and Hang others. But when Noblemen are con∣demn'd to die, they have the priviledge to fight for their Lives with a Lyon; which the King ne∣ver refuses them, except they are convicted of High-Treason.</P>
<P>Those that murder their Fathers, are ty'd to the Tail of an Elephant, and dragg'd along the Streets so long till they die. Others are kill'd by Elephants, wild Beasts, and Serpents.</P>
<P>No Malefactor lies above one Night in Prison, and sometimes not at all; for if he be apprehen∣ded in the Morning, he is immediately carry'd be∣fore a Judge, who either discharges him, or pas∣ses Sentence upon him; which if it be to be whipt, he is immediately stript naked, receiving his punishment in the presence of the Judge; if to die, they instantly carry him to the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market-place. This sudden way of punishing Of∣fenders keeps the People in such awe, that they seldom commit any Crime to deserve it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Robes given to the <HI>Omrahs</HI></NOTE>It is said that the <HI>Mogol</HI> never wears a Sute of Clothes above one day, after which he sends the same with great Ceremony to such <HI>Omrahs</HI> as are his Favorites, who account it a great honor to be clad in the King's Robes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is weigh'd upon his Birth-day.</NOTE>The <HI>Mogols</HI> Birth-day is kept as a great Festi∣val, on which he is weigh'd in the Scale against some Jewels, Gold, Silver, Cloth of Tissue, Butter, Rice, Fruit, and many other things, each of them successively being put into the Ballance; all which falls to the <HI>Mollas</HI> or Priests share. This is done in great state, whil'st several Elephants, hung with Chains, Bels, Gold and Silver Capa∣risons, and Breastplates beset with Rubies and Emeraulds, are brought before him.</P>
<P>From the weight of the King (of which the Physicians take an exact Account) they boast to know his Abilities.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Mogol</HI> is thus weigh'd, he throws small pieces of Silver amongst the Spectators, as also some Gold, in the form of Flowers, Cloves, or Nutmegs, but very thin and hollow; which done, he drinks with his Nobles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of Salutation.</NOTE>The usual Salutation which the <HI>Indians</HI> shew to their King, as also to one another, is in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Teslim;</HI> in the <HI>Indian, Sumback;</HI> and by a corrupt Name amongst the <HI>Europeans, Som∣baya.</HI> The manner of Salutation is perform'd with the right Hand, without taking off their <HI>Tur∣bants,</HI> with which they almost touch the Ground, and lifting it up again very leisurely to their Mouthes, as if they would kiss it, and so still higher and higher by degrees, till they hold it above their Heads.</P>
<P>After the same manner, but with both Hands folded together, they Salute, and shew Reverence to their Gods, and other Consecrated things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian Heathens,</HI> in stead of wishing one another Health, or a good Day, salute one ano∣ther with the Name of their Idol <HI>Ram.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reve∣rence they shew to their Prince.</NOTE>When the King's Vice-Roys come to the Court, or any other place where he is, they bow down their Heads to the Ground, and touch the same with their Hands; after which approaching him by degrees, they bow several times one after another, till they are very near him, when they are search'd by those whose Office it is to see if they carry any Arms about them; after which they go to touch his Feet, whil'st he stands as if immovable: The greatest sign of Friendship that he can shew them, is to lay his Hand on their Shoulders.</P>
<P>Moreover, the rest of the Kings of <HI>India</HI> who are not his Substitutes, when they speak of him, bow their Heads in sign of Reverence.</P>

<P>The King of <HI>Persia</HI> was generally in a League with all the three, and they often corresponded by Ambassadors and Presents, and were always in Amity one with another; which Leagues they maintain'd onely to be the better able to resist the <HI>Mogol,</HI> whose Power they dreaded exceedingly.</P>

But by his refusal to marry his Step-mothers Daughter, he incurr'd her hatred and displeasure, and forc'd her, contrary to her first resolutions, to give her in Marriage to his Brother <HI>Scheriar.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Sultan Peruis,</HI> the second Son, who had his Residence in the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala,</HI> near the Mouth of the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> and Govern'd by the Title of Vice-Roy, no further mention is made.</P>
<P>At the same time the third Son, <HI>Sultan Chorrom,</HI> rebell'd against his Father, with intention to make himself Master of the Kingdom of <HI>Surrat:</HI> Wherefore <HI>Schiah Selim</HI> sent one of his Chief <HI>Chans,</HI> call'd <HI>Ajat Chan,</HI> to <HI>Agra,</HI> to convey his Treasure from thence, before <HI>Sultan Chorrom</HI> came thither.</P>
<P>This <HI>Chorrom</HI> was Governor of that part of <HI>Decan</HI> which he had conquer'd for the <HI>Mogol</HI> his Father; and the occasion of this Rebellion was as followeth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of <HI>Chorrom</HI>'s Rebellion.</NOTE><HI>Chorrom</HI> by his own subtil Contrivance and Conduct, and by the high esteem of his Father-in-Law <HI>Ajat Chan,</HI> and his Sister <HI>Nurmahal,</HI> had so wrought with the King, that the Prisoner <HI>Sultan Chosrou</HI> was committed into his Custody, but with Commands to use him well, and take special care of him: Which being effected, <HI>Chor∣rom</HI> would neither go to his Territory, nor march into the Field with an Army, though his Father requested him, unless he might carry <HI>Sultan Chos∣rou</HI> along with him; under pretence, that it would not be convenient for him to depart from the Court, and leave <HI>Chosrou,</HI> his great Enemy, there. No sooner was <HI>Chosrou</HI> deliver'd up to him, but he immediately went from thence, and kept him two Years in an honorable manner. But at last <HI>Chorrom,</HI> who had no other design but by his Bro∣thers death to secure himself of the Kingdom, practic'd all the time since his coming from his Father's Court, as some affirm, to poyson him; in order to which, he charg'd all those that wait∣ed upon, and guarded him, to force him to eat the poyson'd Meat whether he would or no, or else destroy him after another manner; which they accordingly attempted several times, but <HI>Chosrou</HI> having notice thereof, would not eat any of the Meat that was brought to him by them, expresly telling them that it was poysond. The Keepers seeing no way to perform their Masters Com∣mand by Poyson, fell all upon him with drawn
<PB N="171" REF="128"/>Swords, and after long resistance strangled him with a Bowe-string. Some affirm, That <HI>Sultan Chorrom</HI> kill'd <HI>Chosrou</HI> in publick with his own Hand; but however it hapned, <HI>Chosrou</HI> died an untimely and violent death, and left a young Son call'd <HI>Sultan Bulachi.</HI></P>

<P>Two years before, <HI>viz.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chara∣cter of his Children.</NOTE>The eldest Daughter of <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> was na∣med <HI>Begum Saheb,</HI> that is, <HI>My Lady Princess;</HI> and the youngest, <HI>Raichenara Begum,</HI> that is, <HI>Illustrious Princess,</HI> or <HI>Light of Princesses;</HI> which kind of Names are very frequently given to the Princes and Princesses of this Countrey, because all the Lands belonging to the King, there are no Duke∣doms, Earldoms, nor Lordships, from whence the Nobles can derive their Names and Titles, they having nothing but Rewards for their good Ser∣vices, either in Lands or ready Money, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> gives them, and increases, decreases, or takes away when he pleases; wherefore the <HI>Omrahs</HI> or <HI>Omars</HI> have no other but such kind of Names as these, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Darasja,</HI> the eldest Son, wanted not good Parts; for he was courteous in Conversation, subtil, very civil, and exceeding bountiful, yet so self-conceited, that he believ'd himself able to do all things, and could not imagine that any one was capable of giving him Advice. He often scoffed at those that had given him Council; so that his best Friends durst not adventure to discover to him the secret Intentions of his Brothers. He also on a small occasion would rail, curse, and threaten the greatest <HI>Omrahs</HI> or Lords in his Passion, which soon ceas'd. And although he was a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and manifested the same in his publick Devotion, yet he privately profess'd himself a <HI>Heathen</HI> a∣mongst the <HI>Heathens,</HI> and a <HI>Christian</HI> amongst <HI>Chri∣stians.</HI> He constantly kept some <HI>Pendelt,</HI> or <HI>Hea∣then</HI> Teachers, by him, who receiv'd great Re∣wards, and perswaded him into an Opinion con∣trary to the Religion of the Countrey. He also hearkned some time since to the Instructions of a <HI>Jesuit</HI> call'd <HI>Buze,</HI> and took great liking to his Doctrine; and yet some affirm that he was of no Religion at all, and that that which he did was onely out of curiosity, or for his pleasure, or rather out of subtilty, to make himself belov'd by the <HI>Christians,</HI> of which he had great numbers in his Army, and especially to gain the <HI>Rajas</HI> or <HI>Heathen</HI> Lords Tributary to this Realm, that when occa∣sion should require, he might get them to side with him; but let it be how it will, it did not much tend to his advantage, as shall appear in the fol∣lowing Relation: for the Pretence which <HI>Orang∣zef</HI> made use of to cut off his Head, was because he was turn'd <HI>Caffer,</HI> which is properly an Unbeliever, or one without Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Sujas,</HI> or <HI>Chasausa,</HI> was almost of the same Temper and Disposition, but more subtil and re∣serv'd, and withal very politick in contriving of Plots; for the management whereof he got many Friends, by making Presents to the chief <HI>Omrahs</HI> and eminent <HI>Rajas;</HI> yet still at times of recess was so exceedingly inclin'd to the Sports of <HI>Venus,</HI> that keeping many Concubines, he spent whole Nights and Days in their company. Singing, Drinking, and Dancing with them. He profess'd himself of the <HI>Persian</HI> Belief, although <HI>Schach Je∣han</HI> and all his Brothers were of the <HI>Turks</HI> Opi∣nion; which he did for this reason, because the most eminent Persons at the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court, and those which have the greatest Employments, be∣ing for the most part <HI>Persians,</HI> as also their Chil∣dren, he hop'd by this means to gain their Affe∣ctions to be of his Party.</P>
<P><HI>Oranchzef</HI> had not that generous Spirit, nor af∣fable Deportment as <HI>Darasja,</HI> but seem'd to be of a more profound reach, well knowing all his People, and chose those that would certainly stick to him in time of need. He was very reserv'd, subtil, and a great Dissembler, insomuch that he preten∣ded himself a long time to be a <HI>Fakier</HI> or <HI>Derwis,</HI> that is a poor Monk, who hath deny'd all the Glo∣ries of the World, and seemingly disown'd any Interest in the Crown, and that he desir'd to spend his days in Prayers and Devotion, whil'st he was still plotting at the Court, especially when he was made Vice-Roy of <HI>Decan,</HI> and carry'd his whole Designs with so much secrecy, that no Per∣son could take any notice thereof. He also insi∣nuated himself exceedingly into his Father <HI>Schach Jehan</HI>'s favor, who notwithstanding the great in∣clination he had towards <HI>Darasja,</HI> could not hide his affection to <HI>Oranchzef;</HI> which bred such Jea∣lousies in <HI>Darasja,</HI> that he us'd often to say to his Friends, <HI>Of all my Brothers I fear none but this Nemaz,</HI> that is, <HI>This great Dissembler.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moradbeck,</HI> the youngest of all, was none of the most subtil, thinking on nothing but how to recreate himself, either in Drinking, Hunting, and Arching; yet nevertheless he had some good Parts, and accounted it a great Vertue to keep no∣thing secret. He was indeed a Prince of a noble Temper, which had it been accompany'd with a little more reservedness and prudent Conduct, he would certainly have been preferr'd before his Brother, and made King of <HI>Indostan,</HI> as shall ap∣pear hereafter.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Daughters, <HI>Begum Sa∣heb</HI> being very beautiful, and of a noble Spirit, she was exceedingly belov'd by her Father, and ac∣cording to report, he admir'd her beyond belief, alledging for his Excuse, that (according to the opinion of his <HI>Mollas</HI> or Priests) it was lawful for

<PB N="173" REF="130"/>a Man to eat of the Fruit of the Tree which he had planted: He repos'd so great confidence in her, that he resolv'd to make her the onely Guard of his safety, and to oversee all things that were brought to his Table, so well she knew how to please him, whom she made to do all things to the advantage of such as she affected. She was very rich by the great Rewards and Presents which she receiv'd for her Service in several Businesses: also very expensive, generous, and noble. She declar'd her self wholly for <HI>Darasja,</HI> which was not a little to his advantage, and strengthning of his Father's Affections towards him: for she having a great kindness for him, inform'd him of all things that proceeded between her Father and her other Bro∣thers, which was not so much because he was the eldest Son, and she the eldest Daughter, as the common People believ'd, but because he promis'd to Marry her as soon as he should be King, which is altogether unusual, and a thing almost never heard of in <HI>Hindostan,</HI> because the Husband to a Princess, which must needs be very powerful, would al∣ways be suspected to lay claim, or pretend to the Crown; besides which, the Kings account their Blood so high, that according to their opinion, there can be none found worthy of their Daugh∣ters. She was always kept lock'd up in the <HI>Sera∣glio,</HI> by reason of her great inclination to venerial Sports, as may appear by the following Relation, <HI>viz.</HI> She caus'd a beautiful and well shap'd Youth, of an indifferent Extract, to be brought to her into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which she could not do so privately but that she was discover'd, and the news thereof carried to her Father <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> who resolv'd to surprise her under the pretence of a Visit. When <HI>Begum Saheb</HI> on a sudden seeing her Father unex∣pectedly coming towards her, she had no time to hide her Lover but under a Bathing-tub, which was not done so secretly, but that <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> dis∣cover'd it, yet he neither chastis'd her, nor seem'd to take any notice thereof; but having sat a a considerable time discoursing with her, he said, that to his thinking she was not very well, and ap∣pear'd to him much out of order, which must of necessity proceed from too much Bathing her self, and in a seeming rage commanded the Bathing-tub to be immediately set on fire, resolving in himself not to stir from thence before the Youth and Tub were burnt to Ashes. Not long after she procur'd a <HI>Persian</HI> call'd <HI>Nazerkan,</HI> het Father's <HI>Caneseman,</HI> or Steward of his Court: He being a young <HI>Omrah,</HI> comely, and the most civil of all the Court, was exceedingly belov'd by all Per∣sons, insomuch that <HI>Hestkon,</HI> Uncle to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> endeavor'd to Match him with the Princess; which was very ill resented by <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> who resolv'd, after the Secret had been disclos'd to him, to kill <HI>Nazerkan,</HI> by giving him poyson'd <HI>Betel</HI>-leaves. This young Lord thinking on no∣thing thing less than being poyson'd, going out of the King's Presence very merry, went into his <HI>Pala∣kin,</HI> but dy'd by the Way before he came home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI>'s youngest Daughter <HI>Raichenara Be∣gum,</HI> was never accounted so beautiful nor ingeni∣ous as <HI>Begum Saheb,</HI> but delighted as much in lasci∣viousness: She always sided with <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and declar'd her self an Enemy to her Sister and <HI>Da∣rasja,</HI> which made her not to be so well belov'd, nor had she so much Interest to dispatch Busines∣ses like her Sister; yet nevertheless being in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and holding Correspondence with many Intelligencers, she was not negligent in discovering many Secrets to <HI>Oranchzef.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Schach Jehan</HI> a little before these Troubles see∣ing himself charg'd with these four Princes, all grown up and Marry'd, and observing that each of them pretended to the Crown, and carrying them∣selves as Enemies one to another, sought privately to compass their Designs, was exceedingly per∣plex'd, not knowing what to do, and began to fear his own Person, as if he foresaw what afterwards befell him; to lock them up in <HI>Govaleor</HI> (which is a Fort where Princes are generally secur'd, and in∣vincible by reason of its situation on an inaccessi∣ble Rock, and the abundance of fresh Water, and Provisions for the Souldiers in Garrison) was no small Business, they being already very powerful, and liv'd in the State and Splendor of Princes: Moreover, he could not in honor send them away to any Place, without giving them Dominions ac∣cording to their Birth, and therefore timorous that they might rebell, and make themselves absolute Princes in their respective Jurisdictions, as indeed afterwards they did; yet nevertheless, out of fear least they should destroy one another in his Pre∣sence, which might chance to happen, if he kept them at his Court, he resolv'd to send them away;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sons sent to Govern se∣veral Provin∣ces, onely the eldest stays at the Court.</NOTE> and accordingly seat <HI>Sultan Chasousa</HI> to the King∣dom of <HI>Bengala; Oranchzef,</HI> to <HI>Decan; Moradbeck,</HI> to <HI>Zurratte;</HI> and gave the Government of <HI>Cabul</HI> and <HI>Multan</HI> to <HI>Darasja:</HI> The three first left the Court well satisfi'd with their new acquir'd Do∣minions, where they made themselves supream Governors, and kept the Revenues of the Coun∣treys for the maintenance of strong Armies, un∣der pretence to keep their Subjects and Neigh∣bors in quiet. But <HI>Darasja</HI> being the eldest, and Heir to the Crown, dwelt not from the Court, which was the Design of <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> who al∣ways fed him up with a Promise that he should succeed him; and also granted him to give Com∣missions, and had a small Throne underneath his amongst the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> so that there seemingly were two Kings; but as two equal Powers can scarce agree, so <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> notwithstanding <HI>Darasja</HI> was very respective to him, and shew'd him great Reverence, was still in fear of being poyson'd by him, and the more, because <HI>Darasja</HI> was jealous of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> whom for his excellent Parts his Fa∣ther judg'd fitter to succeed him than any of his other Sons.</P>
<P><HI>Schach Jehan</HI>'s Wife, being exceeding beauti∣ful, was call'd <HI>Tage Mahalle,</HI> that is, <HI>The Crown of the Female Sex.</HI></P>
<P>But for the better explanation of this Story con∣cerning the foremention'd four Princes, and the <HI>Mogol Schach Jehan,</HI> we must relate what hapned a little before these Troubles between <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> and his Visier <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> because this will declare the Nature and Consti∣tution of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who afterwards came to be the <HI>Mogol</HI> and King of <HI>India.</HI> Hereby also it will appear after what manner <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> was em∣ploy'd to lay the first Foundation of <HI>Oranchzef</HI> his Royalty.</P>
<P>At the time of <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s residing in <HI>Decan,</HI> the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> kept the foremention'd <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> as his Vice-Roy, and General of all his Forces. He being a <HI>Persian</HI> born, and very fa∣mous in <HI>India,</HI> was of no high Extract, yet a Man fit to undertake any Design, being a great Cap∣tain, and of a noble Spirit.

But <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> suspecting <HI>Darasja,</HI> and out of fear that he might be poyson'd, gave strict order to watch narrowly all things that he should eat of. He wrote also, as it was reported, to <HI>Oranchzef</HI> concerning it; which <HI>Darasja</HI> hearing, could not contain himself from venting high and passionate Threats. Mean while <HI>Schach Jehan</HI>'s Sickness increasing, and a rumor of his Death spreading through the City, the whole Court was in great disorder; the Citizens taking up Arms, kept their Shops shut up three days, whil'st the four Brothers made great Preparations every one for himself, and not without reason; for they very well knew, that they could not expect any mercy from one another, there being no other way but conquer or die; and that whoever got the better would destroy all the rest, as formerly their Father had done his Brothers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The four Bro∣thers take up Arms, each in his own defence.</NOTE><HI>Sultan Chasausa,</HI> who had gotten a vast accumu∣lation of Treasure in the rich Countrey of <HI>Ben∣gala,</HI> by destroying some of the <HI>Ragias,</HI> or petty Kings, and extorting great Sums of Money from others, came first into the Field with a mighty Army, and proceeded on his Way by the help of the <HI>Persian Omrahs,</HI> of whose Sect he was, to <HI>Agra,</HI> reporting all the way that his Father was dead, and his Brother <HI>Darasja</HI> had poyson'd him, and therefore he resolv'd to revenge his Father's Death, and, in a word, pretended to be king. Mean while <HI>Darasja</HI> sent Letters to him from his Father, with Orders not to come any nearer to <HI>Agra,</HI> assuring him that his Sickness was insigni∣ficant, and that he found himself much better than he had been. But <HI>Chausausa</HI> having Friends at the Court, who assur'd him of the danger of his Father's Distemper, he took no notice of the said Letters, but proceeded on his March, saying he very well knew that his Father was dead, but if he did live, he was resolv'd to go and kiss his Feet and receive his Commands.</P>

Meanwhile I can make use of some of your Forces and Guns, as you shall think fit: You may also lend me a Sum of Money, as you have often proffer'd me: And then I think it will be fit to try Fortune, and that each of us play our Parts, that so we may see and find out the best ways.

But as this was nothing but a design'd Plot, so these Insurrections were soon allay'd, by that which was publickly declar'd to the Chief Offi∣cers of <HI>Emir</HI>'s Army, and by the presence of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who with his two Sons first speaking to one, and then to another, made them great Promises and Presents; insomuch that all <HI>Emir</HI>'s Troops, and most of those of <HI>Schach-Jehan,</HI> see∣ing themselves in this confusion, and without a General, and also believing that <HI>Schach-Jehan</HI> was dead, and the great Promises which were made them of raising their Pay, and that they should have three Months Advance, thereby be∣come altogether improbable, immediately de∣clar'd themselves for <HI>Oranchzef;</HI> who being thus become Master of all <HI>Emir</HI>'s Forces, Cammels, Tents, and Amunition, went into the Field, with a resolution to go to tho Siege of <HI>Surat,</HI> and hasten the taking of it, (which his Brother had protra∣cted) because his Chiefest Men were engag'd there, and found greater resistance than they ex∣pected: But <HI>Oranchzef</HI> having March'd some days, heard that the Governor had surrendred the Place to <HI>Moradbech;</HI> wherefore he immediately wrote Letters to his Brother, advising him of all things that had pass'd between him and <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> and also that he had Forces, Money, and private Friends enough at the Court; and that since he wanted nothing, he resolv'd to March directly towards <HI>Brampour</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> and there∣fore that he should hasten to meet and joyn with him. But <HI>Morabech</HI> found not so much Silver in the Fort of <HI>Surat</HI> as he expected, either because there was not so much as was reported, or that the Governor had convey'd part of it away, as most believ'd: Nevertheless, there was enough to pay his Soldiers, which had entred into his Ser∣vice in hopes to enrich themselves with the Plun∣der of the foremention'd Castle. Neither had he any great reason to boast of the taking of this Place; for they lay before it above a Month: nor had they then effected their design, had not the <HI>Hollanders</HI> assisted, teaching them to spring a Mine, which overthrowing a piece of a Wall, drove the Besieg'd to the utmost extremity: But this Conquest did not a little advantage his De∣sign, the fame thereof being spread all over the Countrey, <HI>That</HI> Moradbech <HI>had won</HI> Surat <HI>by springing a Mine:</HI> Which sounded strange in the <HI>Indians</HI> Ears, who till that time knew not the In∣vention.

But as this young Prince <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> full of Courage, thought on nothing, but how by some Heroick Exploit he might make himself Famous; and <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> fear'd that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> by the winning of a Field-Battel would first make himself Master of the Treasures and Cities of <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Deli:</HI> So it was impossible for <HI>Raja Jes∣seingue</HI> to prevent their engaging one with ano∣ther: For the two Armies were no sooner in sight, but they prepar'd to fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He fights <HI>Cha∣sausa</HI>'s Army, and gets the Victory.</NOTE> and staid not long before they saluted each other with a Volley of small Shot. The first On-set was very fierce on both parts; but at last <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> with great force and eagerness broke the Ranks of <HI>Chasausa,</HI> and forcing him to retreat, soon after put his whole Army to flight; insomuch that if <HI>Jesseingue</HI> and <HI>Patan Delickan</HI> (one of the Chiefest Commanders and valiantest Men, but a private Friend to <HI>Raja,</HI> without whose advice he did no∣thing) had faithfully assisted him, <HI>Chasausa</HI>'s whole Army had been destroy'd, and he himself in danger of being made a Prisoner. But <HI>Raja</HI> (besides that he was commanded to the contrary) was too subtile to lay Hands on a Prince of the Blood, and Son to the King; so that he gave <HI>Chasausa</HI> time to retreat without losing of many People. But because <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> was Ma∣ster of the Feld, and had gotten some Guns, the Report immediately went at Court, that <HI>Chasausa</HI> was utterly destroy'd. This Victory made <HI>Soli∣man Chekouh</HI> very famous, and lessening the esteem which the People formerly had of <HI>Chasausa,</HI> made all the Hearts of the <HI>Persians</HI> which were formerly inclining to him grow very cold.</P>
<P>The young Prince having spent some days in pursuing <HI>Chasausa,</HI> and having daily Information from Court, understood that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Mo∣radbech</HI> approach'd with a great Army; and knowing also that <HI>Darasja</HI> his Father had many private Enemies, he resolv'd to give over his Pursuit, and return speedily to <HI>Agra,</HI> where <HI>Da∣rasja</HI> might perhaps give Battel to <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbech.</HI> This was the best course which he could have taken; for doubtless it he had come thither time enough, <HI>Oranchzef</HI> could not have had any advantage of his Enterprise: nay, some are of opinion, that he durst not have given Bat∣tel, by reason of his small Party; but <HI>Darasja</HI>'s bad fate would not suffer it.</P>
<P>Whilst all things were thus carried on the side
<PB N="178" REF="134"/>towards <HI>Elabas</HI> (which is a Place where the River <HI>Gemna</HI> unites with the <HI>Ganges</HI>) there was quite another Scene acted towards the side of <HI>Agra.</HI> At the Court they fear'd that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> might cross the River of <HI>Brampour,</HI> and have pass'd the trou∣blesom Way between the Mountains, and there∣fore sent several Troops to prevent his passing over the Stream <HI>Eugenes,</HI> whilst the whole Army was made ready, and two of the chiefest Nobles of the Realm were chosen to Command the same; one of them call'd <HI>Casemcan,</HI> a famous Captain, and a great lover of <HI>Schach Jehan;</HI> but having no kind∣ness for <HI>Darasja,</HI> he went thither against his will; yet was perswaded to undertake that Office by <HI>Schach Jehan.</HI> The other, nam'd <HI>Jesseingue,</HI> was a mighty <HI>Raja,</HI> and Son-in-law to that <HI>Raja Rana,</HI> who in the time of <HI>Ecbar</HI> was as if he had been Emperor of the <HI>Rajas. Darasja</HI> before their de∣parture made great Presents to both, and protesta∣tion of Friendship, whilst <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> found out a means to tell them in private, the same which he told <HI>Jesseingue,</HI> before he went with <HI>Soliman</HI> to meet <HI>Chasausa.</HI> Moreover, they neglected not du∣ring their March, to send time after time to <HI>Oranch∣zef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> to perswade them to return to their own Countreys, but all in vain, neither did their Agents come back; whilst the Army mar∣ched with that speed, that from the top of a Hill, lying not far from the River, it was seen sooner than they expected; and by reason of the great Heat, it being in the midst of Summer, the River was fordable, which made <HI>Casemcan</HI> and the <HI>Raja</HI> to prepare themselves for Battel at the same in∣stant, before they knew <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Intentions; for he endeavor'd to oppose them, although his Army was not all come up, for he saluted them with a Volley of Shot, thereby designing onely to deter them; for he fear'd that they would come over the River, and not onely prevent his passing over, but also hinder him from chusing a convenient place to Encamp his Army in, which was in great disorder, and so weary'd with Travel and Heat, that undoubtedly they might easily have been de∣stroy'd, if they had been immediately set upon; but they were satisfi'd according to the Order they had receiv'd to Guard the opposite Shore, and pre∣vent <HI>Oranchzef</HI> from coming over. After <HI>Oranch∣zef</HI> had rested his Army two or three days, and by retarding the Enemy, had so order'd his Business, that he could get over the Stream, he commanded his Guns which were planted along the Bank of the River, to Discharge on the Enemy whilst his Men cross'd the Water. Whereupon <HI>Casemcan</HI> and the <HI>Raja</HI> also Discharging their Guns, and standing in a posture to oppose their Landing, be∣gan a fierce Battel, especially where <HI>Jesseingue</HI> Commanded; but for <HI>Casemcan,</HI> though he was always accounted a valiant Man, yet he gave no great proofs of his Valour in this Fight; nay, some accus'd him of Treachery, and affirm'd, that he bury'd the Powder and Shot in the Night un∣der the Ground. But however it was, the Fight slackned not, for whilst one Party endeavor'd to get over the Water, the other as much striv'd to oppose them: The middle of the River being full of Rocks, prov'd very troublesom to <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Party; who also found the Banks very high and craggy in many places. At last <HI>Moradbeck</HI> cast himself into the Water with such fierce eagerness, that the Enemy not able to oppose him, he got over a good part of his Army, which made <HI>Casem∣can</HI> retreat, and put <HI>Jesseingue</HI> in great danger of lo∣sing his Life; for the Enemy falling so thick upon him, and having slain most of his <HI>Ragipous</HI> that were about him, had also undoubtedly slain him, if he had not fled speedily from thence, and left all his Bag and Baggage to the Enemy; nor durst he go to <HI>Agra,</HI> by reason he had lost so many of his Soldiers; for of seven or eight thousand he had not above five or six hundred left.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The courage and passion of <HI>Jesseingue</HI>'s Wife.</NOTE>Great anger did <HI>Rama</HI>'s Daughter express a∣gainst her Husband <HI>Jesseingue,</HI> in reference to his Flight and Defeat: for when her Servants heard that their Lord was hard by, and had inform'd her what had hapned in the Fight, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Jes∣seingue</HI> had fought with extraordinary valour, lo∣sing all his Men except four or five hundred, and at last, not able to resist the Enemy any longer, was forc'd to flie, she commanded, in stead of sending to receive him and condole his Misfor∣tunes, to lock up the Gates of the Castle, strictly charging not to let in so base a Blot to her Family: adding, that he was none of her Husband, and that she would never see him: The Son-in-law of the noble <HI>Rama</HI> could never have so mean a Soul; that he must think, since he was entred into so noble a Family, he ought to follow their Vertues, and, to speak in one word, either to have con∣quer'd or dy'd. The next moment she was in a greater Passion than before, commanding a Pyle of Wood to be laid for her, that she might burn her self; when to pacifie her, they endeavor'd to per∣swade her that her Husband was slain, and that it could not possibly be otherwise; then on a sud∣den her Countenance changing, and her Gall ri∣sing, she broke out into thousands of Exclamati∣ons against him. In this frantick humor she con∣tinu'd nine days, before she would consent to see him; but at last her Mother comforting her, promis'd, that as soon as the <HI>Raja</HI> was refresh'd, he would raise an Army against <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and regain his lost Honor though at never so dear rate.</P>

<P>In the interim <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> clearly perceiving the Design of <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> and that he
<PB N="179" REF="134"/>had no hopes of perswading them to return, he knew not in that Exigent what to do; fain he would have prevented this Battel, on which all depended, and to which <HI>Darasja</HI> made all imagi∣nable Preparations; but what could he do to op∣pose it? he was still very weak, and in the custo∣dy of <HI>Darasja,</HI> in whom, as is said before, he re∣pos'd no great confidence; wherefore he was forc'd to leave the management of all things to his dis∣cretion, and surrendred to him the chief Forts and Castles in his Dominions, and likewise comman∣ded all his Officers to obey him. Whereupon all Persons were immediately put into Arms, so that an Army was form'd, as it was reported, of a hun∣dred thousand Horse, and twenty thousand Foot, and a vast Train of Artillery: Yet notwithstand∣ing this was the most compleat and biggest Army that ever was seen in <HI>Hindostan,</HI> and sufficient to defeat three or four such as that of <HI>Oranchzef</HI> (who had not above thirty five or forty thousand Men in all, and those tir'd and spent by their long and troublesom March, by reason of the excessive Heats) a thing almost incredible, there was scarce one Person, but ominously presag'd <HI>Darasja</HI>'s ru∣ine, especially because none of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> had any respect or kindness for him, and all the prime Sol∣diers on whom his dependance lay, were in <HI>Soliman Chekou</HI>'s Army. To venture a Battel, all his Friends, as well as <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> disswaded him from. His Father also proffer'd himself in the heighth of his Sickness, to be carry'd into the Field before <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> which undoubtedly would have been a great introducement to Peace, and al∣so very beneficial to <HI>Schach Jehan:</HI> for certainly <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI> would never have dar'd to fight against their own Father; and though they had bin powerful enough to have attempted, they would certainly have suffer'd for it, not onely because their Forces were not equal, and all the great <HI>Omrahs</HI> were so fix'd for <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> that they would not have fail'd, seeing him in the Head of the Army, to have fought very resolutely, but also because that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI>'s Com∣manders had so great an affection for this Prince, whose Creatures most of them were, that they would have turn'd their Swords against them their Generals, and perswaded the whole Army to De∣clare themselves for their old Prince. Then they perswaded <HI>Darasja,</HI> since he would not hearken to any Advice, not to march with his Army into the Field, but to stay till <HI>Soliman Chekou</HI> came to joyn with him, which would be very suddenly, he be∣ing already on his March to <HI>Agra;</HI> which also was good Counsel, because he was a Person belov'd by all, having return'd victoriously, and the most loyal and brave Soldiers being still in his Army. But <HI>Darasja</HI> would not regard any Propositions that were offer'd to him, how reasonable and ad∣vantageous soever, thinking on nothing but giving speedy Battel to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> whom he resolv'd to Encounter in Person; and certainly he did not amiss herein, in respect to his own Honor and par∣ticular Interest, if Fortune had befriended him; but things fell not out as he had contriv'd them, and very probably for these reasons:</P>
<P>He look'd upon himself as Master of <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> whom he knew he could sway as he pleas'd: He was at that time Owner of all his Treasures and strong Holds: <HI>Chasausa</HI> was half defeated, and his two other Brothers came with a faint and tir'd Army to throw themselves into his Hands, which they could not miss if he won the Battel: That then he should at once be absolute Master, at the end of all his Troubles, and attain to the heighth of his Wishes without any ones contra∣diction; when as on the contrary, if his Father should go into the Field, all Affairs would be ac∣commodated, and his Brothers return to their Do∣minions: Moreover, that if he should stay for <HI>So∣liman Chekou</HI> his Son, <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> might plot some Design to his Disadvantage, or contrive some∣thing with <HI>Oranchzef;</HI> and that whatever he should do to gain the Victory, the Reputation his Son had already gotten, would give him all the Honor thereof: What would not he be capable to undertake, swoln with so much Glory and Suc∣cess, and especially being supported as he was by the Favor and Affection of <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> and the greatest part of the <HI>Omrahs?</HI> What did he know whether he would keep any Respect or Duty for his Father, and what his Ambition might prompt him to?</P>
<P>These Considerations made <HI>Darasja</HI> conclude to refuse all Persons Advice, and act according to his own Humor, and thereupon immediately com∣manded his whole Army to march into the Field, and went himself to take his leave of his Father, then in the Castle of <HI>Agra,</HI> who shed a multitude of Tears, embracing him, and thus bespeaking him; <HI>Well,</HI> Darasja, <HI>you are resolv'd to follow your own Will, go, and God bless you; but remember these few words; if you lose the Battel, take heed of ever coming into my Presence.</HI> But all this making no great impression on him, he went away boldly, and taking Horse, rode with his Army to block up the Passage through the River <HI>Schembel,</HI> about twelve Leagues from <HI>Agra;</HI> where Intrenching himself, he resolutely expected his Enemy. But <HI>Oranch∣zef</HI> (who being more subtil and crafty, wanted not good Spyes, that inform'd him of all Transactions) knowing it there to be very difficult, never attemp∣ted to force it, but coming to Encamp himself on the other side, opposite to <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Army, was seen by them, whilst he sent to a rebellious <HI>Raja,</HI> nam'd <HI>Chempet,</HI> several rich Presents, and made him many Promises, if he would permit him to march through his Countrey, that so he might find a place where the River was more fordable. <HI>Chempet</HI> not onely consented, but proffer'd to be his Guide, to lead him cross his Countrey through the Woods and Mountains. Whereupon <HI>Oranchzef</HI> rai∣sing his Camp privately in the Night, left onely some Tents standing, thereby to amuse <HI>Darasja,</HI> and marching night and day, got over the River before he had any notice thereof; but as soon as ever he receiv'd the news, he left his Station, and hasted to Engage his Enemy, who was said to march with great speed towards <HI>Agra,</HI> to gain the River <HI>Gemna,</HI> and there without trouble, and at his pleasure to use the Water, and fortifying him∣self, expect <HI>Darasja</HI>'s coming. This Place, for∣merly call'd <HI>Samongues,</HI> and now <HI>Fatabad,</HI> that is, <HI>The Place of Victory,</HI> is not above three Leagues from <HI>Agra.</HI> Not long after <HI>Darasja</HI> appearing on the Shore of the said River, Encamp'd with his Army between <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> whilst <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> wrote several Letters to <HI>Darasja,</HI> acquaint∣ing him that <HI>Soliman Chekou</HI> was not far off, and therefore it would be prudence in him not to begin the Battel, but to draw nearer to <HI>Agra,</HI> and chuse a good place where he might fortifie himself, and expect his Son's coming. But <HI>Darasja</HI> return'd him in answer, That before three days pass'd, he would bring <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI> bound Hand and
<PB N="180" REF="135"/>Foot before him, to punish them as he should think fit; and without any farther delay, at the same hour drew out his Army, planted all his Guns before, and fastned them together with Iron Chains, to prevent the Enemy's Horse from breaking in upon him; behind these Guns he also plac'd many Camels, each with a Musquet made fast on their Breast, which a Man might Charge or Discharge without setting a Foot on the Ground; behind these Camels were drawn up the greatest part of the Musqueteers, and behind them the rest of the Army, which chiefly consisted in Horse Arm'd with Sword, Bowes, and, a Quiver full of Arrows, as commonly the <HI>Mogols</HI> (by which Name are understood the white People, as <HI>Mahu∣metans, Persians, Turks, Arabians</HI> and <HI>Usbeques</HI>) or with a Sword and a Half-pike, like those which the <HI>Ragipous</HI> carry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wings how order'd, and their strength.</NOTE> Of all these foremention'd sorts of Men he made three Bodies; the right Wing whereof, being Commanded by <HI>Cali-lullah∣kan,</HI> consisted in thirty thousand <HI>Mogols;</HI> the left was Commanded by <HI>Rustam-kan Dakny,</HI> a very eminent and valiant Commander, besides <HI>Raja Chatresale</HI> and <HI>Raja Ramseingue Routle.</HI> Mean while <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI> on the opposite side, drew out their Army almost after the same manner, onely they privately plac'd in the midst of the Troops of some <HI>Omrahs,</HI> several Field-pieces (an Invention of <HI>Emir Jemla</HI>) with no ill effect; they also plac'd here and there several Men to throw <HI>Bannes,</HI> which being a sort of Granadoes fastned to a Stick, are cast amongst the Horse, which often frighting them, puts them into disorder, and many times do great mischief.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Horse very expert.</NOTE>All their Horse fall back and draw up with ex∣ceeding swiftness, and Discharge six several Flights of Arrows sooner than the Musquets two Volleys: They also keep close together in a Body under their respective Officers, especially when they come up to Fight Hand to Hand with their Swords.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battel.</NOTE>Being thus drawn out, the Guns began to play from both sides, (for they always Discharge their Cannons first,) and Arrows were now seen to flie through the Air, when on a sudden there fell a mighty Shower of Rain, that interrupted the Combat, which began again as soon as it ceas'd: <HI>Darasja</HI> mounted on a stately Elephant, command∣ed his Men to fall on on all sides, whilst he advan∣ced in the midst of a Body of Horse directly to∣wards his Enemies Artillery, which receiv'd him so valiantly, that abundance of Men were kill'd round about him; and not onely that Body which he Commanded put into disorder, but also the other Horse that follow'd him; nevertheless he being seen to sit firm on his Elephant, without of∣fering to retreat, and courageously looking about, and making signs with his Hands, to advance and follow him: This disorder soon ceas'd, and every Man resuming his Rank, march'd on with him; but he could not reach his Enemy before he was saluted with another Volley of Cannon-shot, which caus'd a second and great Disorder amongst his Men, making many of them Retreat; yet <HI>Da∣rasja</HI> without changing his Countenance, sat fast on his Elephant, and encourag'd his Men, giving them still signs to follow him, and to advance with all possible speed, without any loss of time: Thus vigorously pressing forward, he forc'd the Enemies Artillery, broke their Chains, entred into their Camp, and hewing down the Camels and Infantry which stood in his way on that side, he open'd a good Passage for the Cavalry that fol∣low'd him; when the Enemy's Horse facing him, they began a fierce Combat: A shower of Ar∣rows fill'd the Air from both sides, <HI>Darasja</HI> him∣self letting flie several amongst them. But these Arrows do but little Execution, most of them be∣ing broken either in the Air, or faln on the Ground without doing any hurt. The first flight of Ar∣rows being made, they fell upon one annother with their Swords, whilst <HI>Darasja</HI> sitting still on his Elephant, encourag'd his Soldiers, call'd and made signs to them, and at last advanc'd with so much resolution and force against all that oppos'd him, that he overthrew the Cavalry, and forc'd them to retreat and flie. <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who also sat on an Elephant, seeing this disorder, was exceed∣ingly perplex'd, yet labour'd with all his might to defend them, though to little purpose; wherefore he drew up the Body wherein his choicest Men were, to make a Head against <HI>Darasja,</HI> who like∣wise forc'd them to retreat in great disorder, not∣withstanding all that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> could do to hinder it; yet nevertheless he lost neither his Valour nor Courage, though he saw the whole Army in a confus'd and flying posture, insomuch that he had not above a thousand, some say but five hundred, that stood to defend him; he also saw that <HI>Da∣rasja,</HI> notwithstanding the difficulty of the Way, which was uneven and full of Holes in many pla∣ces, made as if he would rush in upon him; yet still his Courage abated not, but he kept his Sta∣tion, without the least apprehension of fear, or thought of retreating; and calling every one of his Commanders that were about him by their se∣veral Names, cry'd out <HI>Delirane Codahi,</HI> that is, <HI>Take courage, my old Friends, God is; what hope is there in flying? know you not where our</HI> Decan <HI>is? Codahi, Codahi, God is, God is;</HI> and that none might doubt his Valour, but see how far his Heart was from recoiling, he instantly commanded in the presence of them all, that Chains should be put on his Elephants Feet; which had certainly been done, but that all those that were near him, de∣clar'd their courage and resolution to live and die with him. Mean while <HI>Darasja</HI> endeavor'd to break in upon him, though he was a good distance from him, but the difficulty of the Way much hindred him, and also the opposition he met with from the disorder'd Horse, which cover'd all pla∣ces he was to pass. This Encounter with <HI>Oranch∣zef</HI> he look'd upon as that which was to assure him of the Victory and decide the Battel; and doubtless he would have overcome all the sore∣mention'd Difficulties, and <HI>Oranchzef</HI> with the small number which he had left, would not have been able to resist his, till then, victorious Army; but <HI>Darasja</HI> not knowing how to make use of his advantage, fail'd in the whole, of which I will now shew you the occasion, and how thereby the Scale turn'd to <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Darasja</HI> perceiving that his left Wing was in great disorder, was inform'd, that <HI>Custam-kan</HI> and <HI>Chatresale</HI> were both kill'd; that <HI>Ramseingue Routle</HI> having advanc'd very far, had forc'd the Enemy, and made way through the midst of them, but was now encompass'd by them, and in great danger; all which made <HI>Darasja</HI> desist from his Design, of making directly towards <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and turn to assist his left Wing, where the Fight in the be∣ginning was very smart; but <HI>Darasja</HI> at last got the Victory, forcing and routing all that oppos'd him, yet not so, but that there still remain'd some

But after all, this Treachery would have done no great mischief, if this infamous Man had contented himself with this first effect of his old Grudge, but see how far he carry'd his Rage and Revenge: for he deserted his main Body, and ta∣king onely a few Men with him, rode with all possible speed to <HI>Darasja,</HI> at the same time when he was forcing his way up to <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> and call'd to him with a loud voice, saying, <HI>Mohbareck-bad, Hazaret, Salamet, Elhamd-ulellah; Much joy to you; I rejoyce to see your Majesty in health, you have ob∣tain'd the Victory; what will you do any longer upon your Elephant? is it not enough that you have expos'd your self so long to danger? if the least of those Shots that have been made into your</HI> Dais, <HI>had reach'd your Person, what would have become of us? are there Trai∣tors wanting in this Army? in the Name of God come down quickly, and take Horse; what remains more to be done then, but to pursue these Run-aways? let us not suffer them to escape our hands.</HI> If <HI>Darasja</HI> had at this instant been but so quick of apprehension to have discover'd this Cheat, and likewise to have consider'd the pernicious consequence of his not appearing still upon his Elephant in the view of his whole Army, which ey'd him continually, and withal to have caus'd the Head of this parasitical Traitor immediately to have been cut off, he had undoubtedly been Master of all; but the good Prince suffering himself to be deluded by the fair words of this treacherous Villain, hearkned to his Advice, as if it had been sincere, and free from base Dissimulation, and descending from his Ele∣phant, mounted himself upon a Horse, when scarce a quarter of an hour being past, he perceiv'd the Treachery, and too late repented his too easie cre∣dulity, and looking round about him, ask'd what was become of <HI>Calullakan,</HI> calling him Traitor, and vowing his Death; but the perfidious Villain be∣ing fled, it was too late to threaten him: In the mean time the Army not perceiving <HI>Darasja</HI> on his Elephant, presently imagin'd Treachery, and that he was slain, and were all struck with such a pannick fear, that they thought on nothing but how to escape the fury of <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and save them∣selves; in short, all things were in a confusion, the Army disbanded and fled; a strange and sud∣den alteration! he that saw himself but just now victorious, finds himself in few moments van∣quish'd, abandon'd, and forc'd to flie for the safe∣guard of his Life, whilst <HI>Oranchzef</HI> by sitting but a quarter of an hour longer upon his Elephant, had the Crown of <HI>Hindostan</HI> on his Head, and <HI>Darasja,</HI> for coming down but little more than a minute too soon, saw himself precipitated from the Throne, and become the most unfortunate Prince in the World.</P>
<P>Thus Fortune seem'd to recreate her self, to make the gain or loss of a Battel, and the obtain∣ing of a great Empire to depend as it were on a meer Nothing.</P>
<P>These great Armies of the <HI>Indians,</HI> its certain, do often great things; but when once terror sei∣zeth, and disorder cometh amongst them, there is no stopping of them, but they are like a great River, which breaking through its Banks, overflows all the adjacent Countreys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Behavior af∣ter the Battel.</NOTE><HI>Oranchzef</HI> encourag'd by such wonderful success, was not idle in employing his skill, subtilty, and courage, to promote his interest by all the advan∣tages which so favorable an occasion had put into his hand. <HI>Calullacan</HI> coming to him, proffer'd him his Service, and all those whom he had kept of his Troops; for which he made him many Promises, yet was cautious in receiving them in his own Name, but carrying him to <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> he was re∣ceiv'd by him with stretch'd-out Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Oranchzef</HI> congratulating <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> extoll'd his valour, giving also the honor of the Victory whol∣ly to him, and gave him the Respect of a King in the presence of <HI>Calullacan,</HI> shewing himself as sub∣missive as a Subject ought to be to his Prince; yet in the interim was not negligent of his own Inte∣rest and Concern, but wrote to all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> making sure every day one or other of them; whilst <HI>Chah-kestcan</HI> his Uncle, a great Enemy to <HI>Darasja,</HI> by reason of an Affront which he had re∣ceiv'd from him, did the same for him on his part, setting all People, and raising Parties against him.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Oranchzef</HI> practis'd his subtil∣ty; for whatsoever he acted, treated of, and pro∣mis'd, was not (as he pretended, professing that he design'd himself to live a <HI>Fakier</HI>) upon his own ac∣count, but for <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> by whose Command he did all things, he being the Person design'd to be King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Darasja</HI>'s sad Case.</NOTE>Mean while the unfortunate <HI>Darasja</HI> went in despair to <HI>Agra,</HI> where he durst not visit his Father, remembring the words which he spake to him at
<PB N="182" REF="136"/>his departure, <HI>viz. That he should never think to see him if he lost the Battel.</HI> Yet <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> sent se∣cretly a trusty Eunuch to comfort him, and assure him of his affections, and also to declare to him his trouble for his misfortune, and to demonstrate to him, that the case was not yet desperate, con∣sidering that there was a good Army with <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> his Son, and that he should go to <HI>Deli,</HI> where he would find a thousand Horse in the Roy∣al Stables, and that the Governor of the Fortress had order to furnish him with Money and Ele∣phants: Moreover, That he should be as little ab∣sent as he could, and write often to his Father: And lastly, That he should find out a way to cha∣stise and punish <HI>Oranchzef.</HI> It is said, that when the Eunuch brought this News from his Father, <HI>Darasja</HI> was in such a sollitary and despairing hu∣mor, that he did not give the Eunuch one word in answer, nor send any Messenger to his Father; but after having sent several times to his Sister <HI>Begum Saheb,</HI> he went privately at midnight, with his Wife, Daughter, and youngest Son, <HI>Sepeche∣kouh,</HI> to <HI>Deli,</HI> in the company of not above two or three hundred Persons. Thus leaving him a while on his Journey to <HI>Deli,</HI> we will stay a little at <HI>Agra,</HI> to consider the dexterity and craft where∣with <HI>Oranchzef</HI> proceeded to manage Affairs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Oranch∣zef</HI> manag'd his Affairs af∣ter the Battel.</NOTE>He well knew that <HI>Darasja</HI> and those of his Party had yet some hopes in the Victorious Army of <HI>Soliman Chekouh;</HI> and therefore he endeavor'd to bereave him thereof, or at least to make the same useless to him. To this end he wrote divers Letters to the <HI>Raja Jesseingue,</HI> and to <HI>Delilcan,</HI> the Prime Commanders of <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI>'s Army, telling them, <Q>That there was no more hopes to be built on <HI>Darasja</HI> and his Party; That he had lost the Battel, his whole Army having aban∣don'd him, and submitted themselves to him; and that he being fled alone to <HI>Deli,</HI> could not possibly escape his Hands, he having laid wait in all Places to seise on him.</Q> As to what concern'd <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> he told them, <Q>That he was in a desperate condition, and beyond any hopes of recovery; That they should take great care what they did, and if they were People of un∣derstanding, and desirous to share in his Fortune, and to be his Friends, they should seize on <HI>Soli∣man Chekouh,</HI> and bring him to him.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jesseingue</HI> found himself sufficiently perplex'd in what he had to do, exceedingly fearing <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> and more to lay Hands on a Royal Person, well knowing, that at one time or other some mischief might befal him even from <HI>Oranchzef</HI> himself. Besides, he knew that <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> had too much Courage to suffer himself to be ta∣ken after that manner, and that he would rather die in defending himself. Wherefore having con∣sulted with <HI>Delilcan</HI> his great Friend, and after they had renew'd their Oaths of Mutual Fidelity, he went directly to the Tent of <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> who with great impatience expected him, (he ha∣ving also heard the News of his Father's being defeated) and had already sent for him several times: He then made the Prince a free discovery of all things, shew'd him the Letter of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> told him what course was best for him to take, represented to him the danger he was in, adding, That there was no reason he should repose any confidence in <HI>Delilcan,</HI> or in <HI>Daoudcan,</HI> or any of the rest of his Army; but that as soon as was possible he should flie to the Mountains of <HI>Serena∣guer,</HI> which would be the best Expedient he could take: for the <HI>Raja</HI> of that Countrey being in un∣accessible Places, and not knowing <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> would undoubtedly receive him with much free∣dom; and from thence he might from time to time see how things would go, and always be rea∣dy to return again when he pleas'd. But the young Prince immediately apprehended by this Discourse, that henceforth there was no great confidence to be put in <HI>Jesseingue,</HI> and that there was no safety there for his Person, because he knew <HI>Delilcan</HI> to be of his Party; so that he saw there was a necessity of making use of <HI>Jesseingue</HI>'s Counsel: Whereupon commanding his Baggage to be pack'd up, he immediately march'd towards the Mountains. Some of his most affectionate Friends, as a good number of <HI>Mansebdars, Saieds,</HI> and others, went along to attend him; whilst the rest of the Army, altogether astonish'd, remain'd with <HI>Jesseingue.</HI> But that which was very mean, and a base and sordid act of such eminent Persons, was, that <HI>Jesseingue</HI> and <HI>Delilcan</HI> sent a Party after him, to rob him of his Baggage, and also, among other things, an Elephant laden with golden <HI>Ro∣pias,</HI> which caus'd great disorder amongst those small Troops that follow'd him, occasioning ma∣ny to desert him, and return to the Army; and, to compleat his misfortune, the Countrey People also set upon his Men, pillaging and destroying several of them. Yet nevertheless he got to the Mountains with his Wife and Children, where the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Serenaguer</HI> receiv'd him with all the Honour and Civility he could desire, assuring him also, that he was as much in safety as the King of that Countrey, and that he would pro∣tect and assist him with all his Forces. Mean while Affairs were carried after the following manner at <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oranchzef</HI> comes to <HI>Agra.</HI></NOTE>Three or four days after the Battel at <HI>Samon∣guer, Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI> came directly to the Gates of the City <HI>Agra,</HI> into a Garden about two Miles from the Castle, whither <HI>Oranchzef</HI> sent a trusty Eunuch with Salutations to his Father, and a thousand Protestations of his Affection and Submission, and that he was exceeding sorry for what had pass'd, and for having been forc'd, by reason of the Ambition and evil Designs of <HI>Da∣rasja,</HI> to proceed to all these extremities; more∣over, that he rejoyc'd extremely to hear that he began to find himself better, and that he was come thither for no other end than to receive his Commands.</P>
<P><HI>Schach Jehan</HI> was not wanting to express much satisfaction to the Eunuch as to the Proceedings of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and receiv'd the Submissions of his Son with all possible appearances of Joy, though he very well saw that matters had been carried too far, and sufficiently knew the reserv'd and crafty humor of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and his passion for the Crown, and that he was not to be trusted for all his Words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schach Jehan <HI>circumvented</HI></NOTE> yet nevertheless he suffer'd himself to be circumvented; and in stead of playing the surest Card, by using his utmost Power, by stir∣ring, by appearing, by causing himself to be car∣ried through the Town, and by assembling all his <HI>Omrahs</HI> (for it was yet time to have done all this) he went to out-wit <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> one that was his Crafts-master, and attempts to draw him into a Snare, in which he will be found taken himself. He then sent an Eunuch to him, to let him know, That he well understood the ill Conduct and in∣capacity of <HI>Darasja;</HI> That he could not but call to mind the particular inclination he always had
<PB N="183" REF="136"/>and express'd towards him; That he could not doubt the continuance of his Affection; and last∣ly, That he should come to see him, and advise with him what was best to be done in these dis∣orders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Counter-policy of <HI>O∣ranchzef.</HI></NOTE><HI>Oranchzef</HI> on his part also saw, that he was not to trust too much in his Fathers words, well knowing, that <HI>Begum Saheb,</HI> his Enemy as well as his Sister, was night and day about him, and that it was very probable he acted nothing without her advice: He apprehended likewise, that if he should come unto the Fortress, he might be seiz'd on, and ill treated; it being indeed, according to report, so resolv'd on, and that several of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Women which serve in the <HI>Seraglio</HI> were armed to set upon him so soon as he should enter into the Castle; yet however it was, <HI>Oranchzef</HI> would not hazard himself, though he caus'd it to be rumor'd abroad, that the next day he intended to visit his Father; but when the time was come, he sent away the People which came to wait on him till the next day, and so prolong'd the time, by putting them off from one day to another, insomuch that he never went. Mean∣while he continu'd his secret Counsels and Cabals, and sounded the minds of all the greatest <HI>Omrahs</HI> so far, that at last, after he had well and closely laid his Design, and politickly dispos'd all things for the success thereof, he sent his eldest Son <HI>Sul∣tan Mahmoud</HI> into the Castle, under a pretence of speaking with his Father; who was no sooner en∣tred, but he fell boldly upon the first Sentinel, and drove away all that oppos'd him, whilst a great number of Men appointed for that purpose, force∣ing their passage after him, immediately made themselves Masters of the Walls, which exceed∣ingly astonish'd <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> he seeing himself taken in the same Snare which he had prepar'd for another, imprison'd in his own Palace, and <HI>Oranchzef</HI> Master of the Fort: 'Tis said that he presently sent to try the temper of <HI>Sultan Mah∣moud,</HI> and promis'd him by his Crown and the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> That if he would be faithful to him, and serve him in this Conjuncture, he would make him King; and that in order thereunto, he should immediately come to him, and not slip this op∣portunity: Besides that it would be an action that would accumulate on him the Blessings of Hea∣ven, and an immortal Glory, in regard it would be said for ever, That <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> had deli∣ver'd <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> his Grandfather out of Prison. And certainly if <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> had been resolute enough to undertake the Work, and <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> could have come abroad to shew himself to the Town, and to take the Field, no Man doubts but all his great <HI>Omrahs</HI> would have follow'd him, nor would <HI>Oranchzef</HI> have had the boldness to fight against his own Father in Person, especially since he must have apprehended, that all the World would have abandon'd him, and possibly <HI>Moradbech</HI> himself. And thus it appears that <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> committed a great error, that he did not come out of the Castle after the Battel and <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Flight; though, as others affirm, he did very prudently therein. The same Reasoners maintain, That the greatest fault which <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> could possibly commit, was, that he knew not how to make use of this occasion to se∣cure himself of the Crown, by the most generous Action that ever he could be capable of, to set hi Grandfather at liberty, and thus to do himself Right and Justice, as the Sovereign Umpire of Affairs; whereas, as things then stood, he must one day go and die in <HI>Govaleor:</HI> But <HI>Sultan Mah∣moud</HI> (whether he fear'd that <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> would not keep his Word, or durst not displease his Father) would not hearken to any Offers, nor en∣ter into the King's Appartment, alledging, That he had no Order from his Father to see him; but that he was by him commanded not to return from thence without bringing him the Keys of all the Gates of the Fortress, that so he might come with all safety and kiss his Majesties Feet. Two days were past before it could be resolv'd whether the Keys should be deliver'd to him; during which, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> watch'd night and day with all his Troops about him; till at length <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> seeing all the Guards which watch'd at the little Gate to disband one after another, and perceiving no more safety on his part, deliver'd the same to him, with Order to tell <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> that he should come and see him that day, if he were wise; for he had Business of grand concern to im∣part to him: But <HI>Oranchzef</HI> being too subtile to commit so great an error, instantly made his Eu∣nuch <HI>Etharcan</HI> Governor of the Fort, who present∣ly lock'd up <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> with his Daughter <HI>Be∣gum Saheb,</HI> and all his Women, causing many Gates to be stopp'd up, that so he might neither speak nor write to any body, nor go out of his Appartment without leave. Mean while <HI>Oranch∣zef</HI> wrote a short Letter to <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> which before he Seal'd he shew'd publickly to all; in which, amongst other things, he told him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Letter to his Father.</NOTE> <Q>That he knew from good hands, that notwithstand∣ing those great Protestations of esteem and af∣fection he made to him, and the contempt he express'd of <HI>Darasja,</HI> he had for all that sent two Elephants charg'd with <HI>Ropias</HI> of Gold to <HI>Darasja,</HI> to enable him thereby to recommence the War; and that therefore, in truth, it was not he that Imprison'd him, but <HI>Darasja,</HI> and that he might thank him for it, as the cause of all these Misfortunes; and if it had not been for him, he would have come the very first day of his arrival to him, and paid him all the most dutiful respects he could have look'd for from an humble Son: That for the rest he begg'd his pardon, and a little patience; and that as soon as he should have disenabled <HI>Darasja</HI> from exe∣cuting his evil designs, he would come himself and open the Gates to him.</Q> And indeed the same night that <HI>Darasja</HI> left <HI>Agra, Schach Jehan</HI> sent him two Elephants laden with golden <HI>Ropias,</HI> of which the youngest Sister <HI>Rachenara Begum</HI> gave notice to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and also of the Plot laid against him with the foremention'd <HI>Tartarian</HI> Women; and <HI>Oranchzef</HI> himself had intercepted several Letters sent from his Father to <HI>Darasja.</HI> Others maintain, that there was no such thing; and that the Letter which <HI>Oranchzef</HI> shew'd in publick was onely to blind the People, to labor in some de∣gree to justifie himself in so strange an Action, and to devolve the cause of it on <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> and <HI>Darasja,</HI> as if by them he had been forc'd to these Proceedings. But however it was, so soon as <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> was shut up, almost all the <HI>Omrahs</HI> were in a manner necessitated to go and shew Re∣verence to <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbech;</HI> and (which is almost incredible) there was not one that had the Courage to stir, or attempt the least in behalf of their King, and for him that had made them what they were, and rais'd them from the Dust, and perhaps from Slavery it self (which is com∣mon
<PB N="184" REF="137"/>in this Court) to advance them unto great Riches and Honor; yet some few there were, as <HI>Danechmendcan</HI> and others, that took no side; but all the rest Declar'd for <HI>Oranchzef:</HI> Who thus assur'd of <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> and all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> took what Sums of Money he thought fit out of the Treasury, and then having made <HI>Chabestcan</HI> his Uncle, Governor of the Town, he left <HI>Agra,</HI> and march'd with <HI>Moradbeck</HI> to pursue <HI>Darasja.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sutan Sujas</HI> guilty of the same fatal Error with <HI>Darasja.</HI></NOTE>We are now to reflect upon the Battel at <HI>Sa∣monguer,</HI> and the seeming slight Accident which there prov'd the overthrow of <HI>Darasja:</HI> for the like Oversight, or rather the like piece of Trea∣chery destroy'd <HI>Sultan Sujas,</HI> viz. <HI>Alla Vordica,</HI> one of his chief Captains, made use of the same kind of subtilty which <HI>Calullacan</HI> put in practise a∣gainst <HI>Darasja:</HI> for seeing all <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Army in disorder, he ran to <HI>Sultan Sujas,</HI> and saluted him with the word <HI>Mohbarreck,</HI> that is, wishing of Joy, and praying him with folded Hands not to expose himself any longer to danger on his Elephant, saying, <HI>Come down in the Name of God, get a Horse∣back, God hath made you chief of</HI> India; <HI>let us pur∣sue these Villains, that</HI> Oranchzef <HI>may not escape us. Sultan Sujas,</HI> who had no more consideration than <HI>Darasja,</HI> committed the same fatal Error: for he was no sooner got down from his Elephant, but the whole whole Army missing of him, was struck with terror, and suspecting Treason, suppos'd him either to be taken or slain; whereupon they dis∣banding, fled as <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Army had done, and al∣so forc'd the <HI>Sultan</HI> to flie for the safeguard of his own Life.</P>
<P><HI>Jesseingue</HI> hearing this unexpected news, and perceiving it was not very safe for him to stay there, contented himself with the Spoil he had gotten, and speedily march'd to <HI>Agra,</HI> with inten∣tion from thence to pass to his own Countrey.</P>
<P>In the mean time the noise was already in <HI>Agra,</HI> that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> had lost the Battel, and that <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> was taken Prisoner, whom <HI>Sultan Sujas</HI> brought along with him; nay, <HI>Chahestcan,</HI> Gover∣nor of the Town, and Uncle to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> seeing <HI>Jesseingue</HI> (whose Treachery he had heard of) at the Gates, and despairing of his Life, had taken up a Cup full of Poyson to kill himself; if his Women had not prevented him; so that it was thought, if <HI>Jesseingue</HI> had had the wit and courage to have staid longer in <HI>Agra,</HI> threatned, made Promises, and acted vigorously for <HI>Schach Jehan</HI>'s Freedom, he might undoubtedly have releas'd him, and with the more ease, because all the Inhabitants of <HI>Agra</HI> certainly believ'd for two days together, that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> was overcome. But <HI>Jesseingue</HI> knowing the contrary, durst not stay long, nor attempt any thing, and therefore passing onely through the City, march'd home with all possible speed.</P>

And as for <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> he very well knew his Force, Conduct and Prudence, which made him suspect him; for he knew him to be very wealthy, and his Fame great, and that he pass'd for the first Mo∣ver in all Affairs, and the ablest Man in all <HI>India,</HI> so that he doubted not, but that according to the Examples of <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> he could expect no great good from him. All this would certainly have perplex'd a mean Spirit: but <HI>Oranchzef</HI> in stead of despairing, found a Remedy for all; for he knew how to remove both with so much pru∣dence and kindness, that neither of them could complain of him. He sent them both against <HI>Sul∣tan Sujas</HI> with a mighty Army, and privately told <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> that he had design'd the Governorship of <HI>Bengala,</HI> which was the best Place in all <HI>Hindo∣stan,</HI> for him, during his Life, and his Son after his Death; and that thereby he would begin to ex∣press his Acknowledgments for the great Services he had done him; and that therefore it belong'd to him alone to defeat <HI>Sujas,</HI> which so soon as he had done, he would make him <HI>Mirul Omrah,</HI> which is the first and most honorable Place in <HI>Hindostan,</HI> and no less than the Prince of the <HI>Omrahs.</HI> To <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> his Son he said onely these few words: <HI>Remember that you are the eldest of my Chil∣dren; it is for your self you go to Fight; you have done much, yet is 'tnothing if you conquer not</HI> Sujas, <HI>who is our greatest and most powerful Enemy; I hope God will assist me to be soon Master of the rest.</HI> With these words he dismiss'd them both with the usual Ceremonies of bestowing upon them rich <HI>Serafs</HI> or Clothes, some Horses and Elephants, with rich Caparisons, prevailing in the mean time with <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> to consent to let his onely Son,
<PB N="187" REF="138"/><HI>Mahomet Emircan</HI> stay with him, to be brought up in good Education; or rather, as a Pledge of his Fidelity. In like manner he perswaded <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> to leave his Wife the King of <HI>Golconda</HI>'s Daughter, in <HI>Agra;</HI> pretending that it would be too great a trouble to him to carry her along with him in the Army.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Sujah,</HI> or <HI>Chasausa,</HI> being always very suspicious that the <HI>Raja</HI>'s of the <HI>Lower Bengala</HI> might be rais'd against him, and dreading nothing more than to engage with <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> no sooner heard these Tydings, but out of fear that he might cut off his way to <HI>Bengala,</HI> and that <HI>Emir</HI> might cross the <HI>Ganges</HI> either above or below <HI>Elabas,</HI> he instantly went to <HI>Benaros</HI> and <HI>Patna,</HI> from whence he march'd to <HI>Moguiere,</HI> a little City lying on the Bank of <HI>Ganges,</HI> generally call'd <HI>The Key of Bengala,</HI> lying between the Mountains and Woods.</P>
<P>In this place he judg'd it convenient to Incamp and fortifie himself, causing, for his better securi∣ty, a great Trench to be made from the Town and the River to the Mountains, with a resolution to stay and expect <HI>Emir Jemla</HI>'s coming, and fight with him for the Passage: But he was exceed∣ingly amaz'd when he heard, that several of <HI>Emir</HI>'s Troops which came slowly along the <HI>Gan∣ges,</HI> were sent to no other end than to Alarm him; that he was not there; that the <HI>Rajas</HI> of the Mountains which lay on the right side of the River were joyn'd with <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> and <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> who came marching night and day through their Countrey, directly towards <HI>Rage∣mehalle,</HI> with the main Body of the Army, in∣tending to intercept him; which News forc'd <HI>Chasausa</HI> suddenly to desert his Fortresses, and ma∣king extraordinary haste (notwithstanding he was forc'd to follow those Windings which the River <HI>Ganges</HI> makes on that side) he came some days before <HI>Emir</HI> to <HI>Ragemehalle,</HI> where he had time to fortifie himself, because <HI>Emir,</HI> when he was in∣form'd thereof, went up along the left side of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> through bad Ways, there to expect his Troops, with the Artillery and Baggage that were also coming along the River.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Casausa</HI> put slight by <HI>E∣mir Jemla.</HI></NOTE> No sooner was his whole Army come together, but he went to encounter with <HI>Sultan Chasausa,</HI> who for five or six days time defended himself valiantly; but seeing that <HI>Emir</HI>'s Cannon batter'd down all his Works, which were made onely of Earth and Bushes, and could not possibly oppose him much longer in that Place, besides that the Rainy Sea∣son approach'd, he fled in the night, leaving two Pieces of Ordnance behind him, besides Ammu∣nition and Provision, which in that hurry he could not possibly carry away. <HI>Emir</HI> fearing Ambus∣cades, durst not pursue him in the night, but staid till the next morning; when, just as if Fortune would favor <HI>Chasausa,</HI> there fell a mighty Storm of Rain, which lasted three days: so that <HI>Emir</HI> was not onely detain'd at <HI>Ragemehalle</HI> during that time, but necessitated to take up his Winter-Quarters there; for these Rains render the Ways so trou∣blesom for above four Months, <HI>viz. July, Au∣gust, September,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> that no Army is able to march. Thus <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> had time to re∣tire, and to chuse a convenient Place of Defence, the better to recruit both his Forces and Train of Artillery from <HI>Lower Bengale,</HI> because he had been very friendly to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> which for the fer∣tility of the Countrey were come to settle there, and had always been very respective to the Ca∣tholick Priests which are in this Province for the promulgating of their Religion, making them great Promises to enrich them all, and give them free leave to build Temples wheresoever they pleas'd. And indeed they were capable enough to serve him, there being in <HI>Bengale</HI> at least eight or nine thousand Families of <HI>Franks,</HI> either Na∣tive <HI>Portuguese,</HI> or <HI>Mestizes,</HI> being such as are got∣ten by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> on <HI>Indian</HI> Women.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> who for the foremention'd Reasons was grown very insolent, and perhaps at that time aspir'd to greater things than he ought, pretended to command the Army absolutely, and that <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> should follow his Orders, letting also from time to time many insolent Words fall in reference to his Father <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> as if he were oblig'd to him for the Crown, and utter'd con∣temptible and threatning Expressions against <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> which caus'd a great coolness between them; but at last, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> being inform'd that his Father was much dissatisfied with his ill Conduct, and fearing that <HI>Emir</HI> might have Or∣der to secure his Person, he went, accompanied with a small number of Men, to <HI>Sultan Chasausa,</HI> to whom swearing Fidelity, he made great Promi∣ses: But <HI>Chasausa,</HI> who look'd upon it as a Plot of <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Emir,</HI> durst not confide in him, but kept a continual Eye over him, and gave him no considerable Command; which so dissatisfied him, that some Months after he concluded to leave <HI>Sultan Chasausa,</HI> and went again to <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> who favorably receiving him, promis'd to write in his behalf to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> whom he would endeavor to perswade to forget and pardon his Errors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Mah∣moud <HI>sent to</HI> Govaleor.</NOTE>Some are of opinion, that this Escape of <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> was altogether by the contrivance of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who car'd not much to hazard this Son to destroy <HI>Chasausa,</HI> and was sensible that this would be a very just pretence to secure his Person. But however it was, he shew'd himself much dis∣pleas'd with him; yet at last he wrote him a Let∣ter of Pardon, and commanded him also to come speedily to <HI>Deli:</HI> But in the interim he gave Or∣der that he should not come so far: for no sooner had <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> cross'd the <HI>Ganges,</HI> but he met with a Party appointed to seize him, who locking him up in an <HI>Embory</HI> (after the same manner as they had done <HI>Moradbech</HI>) carried him to <HI>Govaleor.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Oranchzef</HI> freeing himself from great perplexity, told his second Son, that the Point of Reigning was so ticklish a thing, that Kings must be jealous of their own Shadow: Therefore if he were not discreet and careful, the same thing might happen to him as had befallen his Brother; but that whilst he kept himself within the bounds of his Duty and Obedience, he should find him a loving and indulgent Father: Protesting likewise, That he intended not to offer the least violence to the Person of <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> his Father. But <HI>Oranchzef</HI> had at this time no occasion to suspect his Son <HI>Sultan Mazum,</HI> or to be dissatisfied with him; for never was any Slave more humble: nor did ever <HI>Oranchzef</HI> himself appear more careless of Greatness, nor more given to Devotion, than <HI>Sultan Mazum:</HI> Yet some knowing Persons be∣liev'd, that he was not so in reality, but by super∣lative Policy and Craft, like his Father, of which we may have a Proof in time.</P>
<P>Whilst Matters were thus transacted in <HI>Bengala,</HI> and <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> oppos'd <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> the best he could, <HI>Emir</HI> marching first on one side of the
<PB N="188" REF="139"/><HI>Ganges,</HI> and then on the other, <HI>Oranchzef</HI> kept about <HI>Agra,</HI> marching from Place to Place, and having put <HI>Moradbech</HI> into <HI>Govaleor,</HI> he went to <HI>Deli,</HI> where he began to act the Part of an Abso∣lute King, giving Order for all Affairs of the Kingdom; and especially he plotted means to take <HI>Darasja,</HI> and get him out of <HI>Surat,</HI> for the Reasons beforemention'd: And by his great For∣tune and exceeding subtilty he soon drew him thence, in the following manner.</P>

Therefore writing to him several Letters, <Q>he made him sen∣sible of the great danger he underwent to ex∣pose himself in that manner; That <HI>Oranchzef</HI> would never pardon him; That he was a <HI>Raja</HI> himself; That he should think on sparing the Blood of the <HI>Ragipous;</HI> That if he thought to draw the <HI>Raja's</HI> to his Party, he would find those that would attempt to hinder his Design: In a word, That it was a Business which concern'd all the Gentry of <HI>Indostan,</HI> and would expose them to danger, if such a Fire were suffer'd to kindle, which could not be extinguish'd at plea∣sure. But if he would leave <HI>Darasja</HI> to him∣self, <HI>Oranchzef</HI> resolv'd to forget all that was past, restore again whatever he had taken from him, and at the same time make him Governor of <HI>Surat,</HI> which would be very advantageous to him, because that Countrey lay near to his Lands, and that there he might be in safety so long as he pleas'd.</Q> In short, this <HI>Raja</HI> prevail'd so much, that he made <HI>Jessomseingue</HI> return to his own Countrey. Mean while <HI>Oranchzef</HI> approach'd with his whole Army to <HI>Asmeer,</HI> and incamp'd in sight of <HI>Darasja.</HI> And now what could this poor Prince <HI>Darasja</HI> do? He fees himself abandon'd, and frustrate of all his hopes: To return with his Army safe to <HI>Amadabad,</HI> he saw was altogether im∣possible, because it is above thirty five days Journey, and in the midst of Summer, and he wanted Water; the Countreys likewise through which he was to pass belonging to the <HI>Raja's,</HI> all Friends or Allies to <HI>Jesseingue</HI> or <HI>Jessomseingue;</HI> and that also <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Army would certainly pursue him: <HI>Wherefore</HI> (said he) <HI>we must die on the Spot; and therefore let us resolve, though we are very unequal to them in Power, to give them Battel, and hazard All.</HI> But in vain does he exhort his Soldi∣ers; for he is not onely abandon'd by them, but having <HI>Chah-Navazecan</HI> with him, in whom he repos'd great Confidence, he was by him betray'd, and all his Designs made known to <HI>Oranchzef.</HI> It is true, that <HI>Chah Navazecan</HI> was slain in the Battel, either by <HI>Darasja</HI>'s own Hand, as many believe; or, more probably, by <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Sol∣diers, who being private Friends to <HI>Darasja,</HI> found out a means to seize upon and kill him, for fear he might have some knowledge of a Letter they had written to <HI>Darasja,</HI> and so discover them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Battel between <HI>Da∣rasja</HI> and <HI>O∣ranchzef.</HI></NOTE>The Battel began in the morning about nine or ten a Clock. <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Artillery was planted on a Hill, and sufficiently heard; but most be∣liev'd they shot nothing but Powder, so great was the Treachery of his Officers. And indeed this was properly no Fight, but a meer Plot to ruine him; for the Fight was scarce begun, when <HI>Jes∣seingue</HI> finding himself near <HI>Darasja,</HI> perswaded him, that unless he was resolv'd to be taken Pri∣soner, he should fly: So that <HI>Darasja</HI> exceeding∣ly amaz'd, was forc'd at the same instant to re∣treat in such confusion, that he had not time to load away his Goods and Carriage, but with great difficulty escap'd with his Wife. Moreover it is certain, that if the <HI>Raja Jesseingue</HI> had pleas'd, <HI>Darasja</HI> could never have escap'd; but he was al∣ways ways inclin'd to be favourable to the Royal Fa∣mily; or rather, he was too subtile and politick, and too sensible of future things, to hazard the danger that might ensue for laying hands on a Prince of the Blood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daraja</HI>'s Flight and Misery.</NOTE>Thus this unfortunate Prince, abandon'd by all except two thousand Men which accompanied him, was necessitated, in the midst of Summer, without Tents, or necessary Accommodations, to travel through all the Countreys of the <HI>Raja's</HI> which lie between <HI>Asmeer</HI> and <HI>Amadabad;</HI> whilst the <HI>Koullys,</HI> the Rusticks of this Countrey, and the greatest Villains and Robbers of all <HI>India,</HI> pursuing him day and night, kill'd and robb'd all those which they found straggling from the Main Body, if they lagg'd never so little behind. Yet notwithstanding, <HI>Darasja</HI> made shift to get within a days Journey of <HI>Amadabad,</HI> hoping the next morning to refresh himself in the Town, and en∣deavor once more to raise some Forces: But all things fell out contrary to the expectation of this unfortunate Man; for the Governor whom he had left in the Castle of <HI>Amadabad</HI> had already re∣ceiv'd both menacing and promising Letters from <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> so that his Courage failing, he declar'd for his side; wherefore he wrote to <HI>Darasja,</HI> That he should not come any nearer, for the Gates of the City were shut, and every Man up in Arms against him.</P>
<P><HI>F. Bernier,</HI> Physician to this Prince, and at∣tending then on him, saith, <Q>When he oblig'd me to follow him, having then no other Phy∣sician about him, and the night before he re∣ceiv'd this News from the Governor of <HI>Amada∣bad,</HI> he did me the Honor to make me come into the <HI>Caravansera</HI> where he was, out of fear to be set upon that night by the <HI>Coullys;</HI> and I was (a thing incredible in <HI>Hindostan,</HI> where all No∣blemen are so exceeding jealous) so near to this Princes Consort, that the Cords of the <HI>Canates,</HI> or little Houses (for they had not so much as a Tent) were fastned to the Wheels of my Cha∣riot. I relate this Circumstance by the by, one∣ly to shew the Extremity <HI>Darasja</HI> was reduc'd to. When the Women heard the forementi∣on'd sad News, That they could not get into the City (which was about the break of day) they broke forth into strange Cries and Lamen∣tations, and all things were in an inexpressible confusion, every one looking upon his Neigh∣bor, and none knowing what to do, or what would become of them: Soon after <HI>Darasja</HI> coming forth strangely terrified, first spoke to one, and then to another, even to the meanest

<PB N="189" REF="140"/>Soldier: But seeing them all amaz'd, and ready to abandon him, what Counsel can he take? Whether can he go? He must fly instantly, but whether he knew not: And you may judge of the extremity he was in by this small accident I shall here relate: <HI>viz.</HI> Of three great Oxen which drew my Chariot, one died the day be∣fore, another in the night, and the third was not able to go; for during the small time I was with him, we march'd night and day, the Heat and Dust being intolerable; so that, to my good Fortune, he left me behind, not being able to get either Oxen, Horses, or Camels for me. I saw him march away with Tears in his Eyes, accompanied with four or five hundred Cava∣liers at the most, and with two Elephants, which were said to be laden with Treasure, with in∣tention to go to <HI>Tatabacor,</HI> seeing he could do no better, though it seem'd almost, if not altogether impossible, in respect of the few Men which he had left, and the vast Sandy▪ Desarts, for the most part without Water, which he was to cross in the heat of Summer, which destroy'd many of those that follow'd him, especially several of his Women, who perish'd either of drought, the unwholesom Waters, tiresom Ways, ill Food, or by the <HI>Coullys</HI> beforemention'd: Yet nevertheless with much pains he reach'd the Countrey of the <HI>Raja Catche,</HI> though it had been happier for him to have died also in his March thither.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Darasja</HI> be∣tray'd by the <HI>Raja Gatche.</HI></NOTE>This <HI>Raja</HI> at first gave him a very good Re∣ception, even so far as to promise him assistance with all his Forces, provided he would give his Daughter in Marriage to his Son: But <HI>Jesseingue</HI> inform'd thereof, soon prevail'd with this <HI>Raja,</HI> as he had done with <HI>Jessomseingue;</HI> so that <HI>Darasja</HI> observing the kindness of this <HI>Barbarian</HI> to cool on a sudden, and that consequently his Person was in danger there, he betook himself to the pursuit of his Expedition to <HI>Tatabacar.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Darasja</HI> proceeded forward in his Jour∣ney, the War continu'd still in <HI>Bengala,</HI> and much longer than was expected; <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> using his whole endeavor to conquer <HI>Emir Jemla:</HI> Yet this troubled not <HI>Oranchzef</HI> so much, because he knew it was a great way between <HI>Bengala</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> and being sufficiently assur'd of the Fidelity and Valor of <HI>Emir Jemla;</HI> but that which dis∣quieted him, was to see <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> almost at his Gates, (for it is not above eight days Journey from <HI>Agra</HI> to the Mountains) and being perpe∣tually allarm'd by the Rumors which were spread, That he was coming out of the Moun∣tains with the <HI>Raja:</HI> And indeed it was very dif∣ficult to draw him from thence; but he compass'd his Design after this manner. He made the <HI>Raja Jesseingue</HI> write divers Letters to the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Sere∣naguer,</HI> promising him very great things if he would surrender <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> to him; and threatned to proclaim War against him, if he re∣fus'd to comply with his desire. But the <HI>Raja</HI> re∣ply'd, That he would rather lose his Estate than do so unworthy an action. Whereupon <HI>Oranch∣zef,</HI> seeing his resolution, march'd with his Army directly to the Foot of the Mountains, where, by an infinite number of Workmen, he cut a Passage through the Rocks: But the <HI>Raja</HI> laugh'd at his vain Attempt; and indeed he had no cause to fear, though <HI>Oranchzef</HI> cut never so long, the Moun∣tains being inaccessible for an Army, and the Rocks able to withstand all the Powers of the <HI>Indostans,</HI> which forc'd <HI>Oranchzef</HI> to return with∣out effecting any thing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Siege of <HI>Tatabacar,</HI></NOTE>Mean while <HI>Darasja</HI> approaching the Fortress of <HI>Tatabacar,</HI> and being come within two or three days Journey of the same, receiv'd Advice, That <HI>Mirbaba,</HI> after having Besieg'd the Place a consi∣derable time, had at length reduc'd it to the ut∣most extremity, insomuch that a Pound of Rice or Flesh was sold for a Crown, and all other Pro∣visions accordingly: Nevertheless the Governor holding out, made divers Sallies, which extreme∣ly incommoded the Enemy, and express'd all pos∣sible Prudence, Courage, and Fidelity, deriding the Proposals of <HI>Mirbaba,</HI> and all the Menaces and Promises of <HI>Oranchzef:</HI> And when he heard that <HI>Darasja</HI> was not far off, he redoubled his Libera∣lities, and knew so well to gain the Hearts of all his Soldiers, and to encourage them to fight brave∣ly, that there was not one but what resolv'd to Sally out upon the Enemy, and to hazard all to raise the Siege and force <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Entrance: Mean while he sent Spies into <HI>Mirbaba</HI>'s Camp to assure the Soldiers that they had seen <HI>Darasja</HI> ap∣proach with great Resolution, and considerable Forces, which struck such a fear amongst the Sol∣diers, that had <HI>Darasja</HI> come at that instant, as it was expected, the Enemies Army had on sight of him undoubtedly Disbanded, and a great part thereof gone over to him: But he was still too unfortunate to atchieve any thing for his own ad∣vantage; wherefore considering with himself, that it was impossible for him to raise the Siege with such a handful of Men as he had, he resolv'd to cross the River <HI>Indus,</HI> and get into <HI>Persia,</HI> which could not have been done without great trouble, by reason of the Desarts, and want of Water which is in those Parts; besides those Countreys are Govern'd by Petty <HI>Rajas</HI> and <HI>Patans,</HI> who ac∣knowledge neither the <HI>Persian</HI> nor <HI>Mogol</HI> for their Superior. But his Consort disswaded him from that Resolution, for this weak Reason, <HI>viz.</HI> That if he went into <HI>Persia,</HI> he must be contented to see his Wife and Daughter Slaves to the King of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> which was a thing no ways befitting the Gran∣deur of his Family; and that he ought rather to die, than undergo that Infamy. <HI>Darasja</HI> being in this perplexity, at last remember'd, that not far from thence resided a Powerful <HI>Patan,</HI> call'd <HI>Gimcan,</HI> whose Life he had formerly twice sav'd, when <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> had commanded he should be cast under the Feet of an Elephant, for having rebell'd divers times against him: Therefore he resolv'd to go to him, hoping that he would give him sufficient Succors to raise the Siege of <HI>Tataba∣car;</HI> for he made full account to fetch his Treasure from thence, and going with it to <HI>Candahor,</HI> find out a means to get into the Kingdom of <HI>Cabul:</HI> And this he thought the more feasible, because he repos'd great confidence in <HI>Mahobetcan,</HI> who being Governor of that Place, was exceedingly belov'd, and obtain'd his Government by <HI>Darasja</HI>'s means. But his Nephew <HI>Sepe Chekouh,</HI> though very young, observing his Resolution, threw himself down at his Feet, and begg'd of him not to enter into the Countrey of that <HI>Patan:</HI> His Wife and Daugh∣ter also did the same, remonstrating to him, That he was a Robber, a Revolted Governor, and that he would infallibly betray him; That he ought not to stand upon raising of the Siege, but rather endeavour to gain <HI>Cabul,</HI> which would not be al∣together so impossible, because it was very impro∣bable that <HI>Mirbaba</HI> would raise his Siege to follow
<PB N="190" REF="141"/>him, and prevent his getting into the forementi∣on'd Countreys. But <HI>Darasja</HI> being carry'd headlong by the violence of his unhappy Destiny, rejected this Counsel, and would hearken to no∣thing that was propos'd to him, alledging, as was true, that the March would be very difficult and dangerous, and being confident that <HI>Gioncan</HI> would not be so base as to betray him, after all the good Service which he had done him; wherefore he went thither, notwithstanding all that could be said to him, and went to prove at the price of his Life, that no trust is to be put in a wicked Man. This Traitor believing at first, that he had nume∣rous Troops following of him, gave him the fairest Reception that could be, and to all appearance Entertain'd him with great civility and kindness, Quartering his Soldiers here and there amongst his Subjects, with strict Orders to treat them well, and give them what Refreshments the Countrey afforded; but as soon as he found that <HI>Darasja</HI> had not above two or three hundred Men, he quickly appear'd what he really was. It is uncertain whe∣ther he receiv'd any Letters from <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> or whether his Avarice was not tempted by some Mules which were said to be laden with Gold, being all that could be sav'd hitherto, as well from the hands of Robbers, as from those that convey'd it: But whatsoe're it was, one Morning, when all Persons thought themselves most secure, and the wearied Soldiers took no care but how to rest and refresh themselves, believing all to be safe, be∣hold! this Traitor, who had bestirr'd himself all Night to get Armed Men from all Parts, fell up∣on <HI>Darasja</HI> and <HI>Sepe Chekou,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Darasja</HI> is made Priso∣ner by <HI>Gion∣can.</HI></NOTE> kill'd some of their Men who stood up to defend themselves, seiz'd on the Mules, and Camels, and all the Womens Jewels, and caus'd <HI>Darasja</HI> to be ty'd fast upon an Elephant, commanding an Executioner to go be∣hind him and cut off his Head on the least sign gi∣ven, in case he should be seen to make any resi∣stance, or if any one should attempt to rescue him. In this manner he was carried to the Army at <HI>Ta∣tabacar,</HI> and deliver'd to the General <HI>Mirbaba,</HI> who caus'd him to be conducted in company of this vile Traitor to <HI>Lahor,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Deli.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Darasja</HI> was come to the Gates of <HI>Deli, Oranchzef</HI> consulted whether he should be brought through the midst of the City, or sent directly to <HI>Govaleor.</HI> Many were of opinion that he ought to travel guarded, to prevent any Disorder that might happen to arise, or lest some Attempt should be made to rescue him, which would be a great dishonor to the Royal Family. Others maintain'd the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was abso∣lutely necessary he should pass through the Town, to astonish the World, and manifest the absolute Power of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and to free the common Peo∣ple from their doubtings, who else might more firmly be perswaded in their Minds that it was not he, as indeed many <HI>Omrahs</HI> were, and also take a∣way all hopes from those that entertain'd any af∣fection for him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is carried in teiumph through <HI>Deli.</HI></NOTE> which Arguments prevailing, he was set upon an Elephant, with his two Nephews on each side, and behind him <HI>Badurcan</HI> in stead of the Executioner: This was none of those stately Elephants from <HI>Geylon</HI> or <HI>Pegu,</HI> richly caparison'd, on which he us'd to Ride, but an old poor dirty Beast, with a ragged Cover, and a pitiful Seat all open: He had then no more the Necklace of Pearls which those Princes use to wear, nor those rich <HI>Turbants</HI> and embroider'd Vestures, his Gar∣ments being a Vest of dirty course Linnen, and a <HI>Turbant</HI> of the same, with a tatter'd Scarf of <HI>Cackmire</HI> over his Head like a Varlet; his Son <HI>Sepe Chekouh</HI> was in the same Equipage. In this miserable posture he was made to enter into the Town, and to pass through the high Streets, to the end he might be seen by all People, and by that means fully satisfie all those, who till then very much doubted that it was not he. Most People were exceedingly amaz'd at the boldness of ma∣king him pass through the Town, and the more, because he was but ill guarded, and exceedingly belov'd by the Vulgar, who at that time exclaim'd highly against the cruelty and tyranny of <HI>Oranch∣zef,</HI> as one that kept his Father in Prison, and also his own Son <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Mo∣radbeck;</HI> but not one Man had the boldness to draw his Sword, onely there were some of the <HI>Fakiers,</HI> and some poor People, who seeing that infamous <HI>Gioncan</HI> ride by his side, began to rail and throw stones at him, and to call him Traitor; and indeed all the tops of the Houses and Shops being throng'd with Spectators, there was nothing heard but loud Outcries and Lamentations, with Invectives and Curses heap'd upon <HI>Gioncan;</HI> in a word, both Men and Women, great and small, so compassionate are the <HI>Indians,</HI> were ready to melt into Tears, yet none durst attempt to rescue him. Being thus conducted through the City, he was put into a Garden call'd <HI>Heider Abad.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Consultati∣on held, whe∣ther to put him to death, or send him to <HI>Govaleor.</HI></NOTE>Several Persons of Quality that were there pre∣sent, were not wanting to tell <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> that most of the People seeing <HI>Darasja</HI> pass by, lamented for him very much, and cursing the <HI>Patan</HI> that had de∣liver'd him, were ready to stone him to death, and consequently there was great fear of an In∣surrection or Disturbance. Whereupon the Coun∣cil being call'd, they again consulted what was best to be done, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether they should send <HI>Darasja</HI> away to to <HI>Govaleor,</HI> as they had before concluded, or whether they should put him to death without any farther delay. Some were of opinion, that he ought to be carry'd to <HI>Govaleor</HI> with a strong Party of Horse; upon which <HI>Da∣neck Mendcan,</HI> though an old Enemy of <HI>Darasja</HI>'s insisted very much. But <HI>Raichenara Begum,</HI> in pro∣secution of her hatred against this Brother of hers, perswaded <HI>Oranchzef</HI> immediately to destroy him, and not run the hazard of sending him to <HI>Go∣valeor.</HI> In like manner all his old Enemies, as <HI>Ca∣lullacan, Chahestcan,</HI> and especially a certain dis∣sembling <HI>Peruschian,</HI> who was fled out of <HI>Persia,</HI> first call'd <HI>Hakim Daoud,</HI> and afterwards, when created a great <HI>Omrah, Tacarmbcan.</HI> This Villain boldly standing up in the publick Assembly, cry'd out, That it was expedient for the safety of the State, to put him to death immediately, and the rather, because he was not a <HI>Musselman,</HI> or <HI>Mahu∣metan;</HI> that long since he was turn'd <HI>Caffer,</HI> Ido∣later, a Man without Religion, and by that means had brought upon himself this, which was a just punishment for his sins. But certain it is, this vile Wretch afterwards felt the smart of his unjust Imputation; for in a short time he fell into Dis∣grace, being treated like an infamous Fellow, and dy'd a miserable Death. But <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> carry'd a∣way by these Instances and Motives, commanded that he should be put to death, and that <HI>Sepe Che∣kou</HI> his Nephew should be sent to <HI>Govaleor.</HI></P>
<P>The Charge of this Tragical Execution was given to a certain Slave call'd <HI>Nazer,</HI> who had been bred up by <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> and was known to have been misus'd by <HI>Darasja.</HI> This Executioner,
<PB N="191" REF="141"/>accompany'd by three or four Parricides more, went to <HI>Darasja,</HI> who was dressing some Meat for himself and his Nephew, fearing to be poyson'd if he should trust any one else to do it. As soon as he espy'd <HI>Nazer,</HI> he cry'd to <HI>Sepe Chekou</HI> his Ne∣phew, <HI>Behold, my Son, yonder are those that come to kill us,</HI> laying hold at the same instant on a small Knife, which was all the Weapon that was left him, with which he defended himself to little pur∣pose, whilst some of the Villains seiz'd on <HI>Sepe Che∣kou,</HI> and the rest pressing upon him, threw him down to the Ground, and held him by the Hands and Feet till <HI>Nazer</HI> cut off his Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Darasja</HI> murder'd.</NOTE> which was immediately carry'd to the Castle to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who commanding the same to be put into a Char∣ger of Water, call'd for a Handkerchief, and ha∣ving wash'd off the Blood, and seeing that it was the real Head of <HI>Darasja,</HI> he fell a weeping, utter∣ing these words: <HI>Oh unhappy! Oh unfortunate Man! Take away this Sight from mine Eyes, and bury it in the Grave of</HI> Homayon.</P>
<P>In the Evening they put <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Daughter into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> though afterwards upon her Re∣quest she was sent to <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> and <HI>Begum Saheb.</HI> As for <HI>Darasja's</HI> Wife, she ended her Days before at <HI>Lahor,</HI> poysoning her self, when she foresaw the Extremities she was falling into with her Husband. <HI>Sepe Chekou</HI> was sent to <HI>Gova∣leor;</HI> and after a few days <HI>Gioncan</HI> was sent for to appear before <HI>Oranchzef</HI> in the Assembly, where several Presents being made to him, he was again dismiss'd; but in his Way home he was rewarded according to his Deserts, being kill'd in a Wood; this barbarous Man not knowing nor considering, that though Kings do sometimes permit such Acti∣ons for their Interest, yet they abhor the Actor, and sooner or later revenge them.</P>
<P>Mean while,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tatabacar</HI> surrrendred.</NOTE> the Governor of <HI>Tatabacar</HI> was forc'd, upon an Order press'd and obtain'd from <HI>Darasja,</HI> to surrender the Fort, though upon a good Composition if it had been real; but the poor Go∣vernor coming to <HI>Lahor,</HI> was, together with the few of those Men that accompany'd him, upon the Command of the <HI>Calullacan,</HI> Governor of that Place, cut in pieces. The reason why the Articles of Agreement were not perform'd, was because it was reported that the Governor made private Pre∣parations to go to <HI>Soliman Chekou;</HI> to which pur∣pose he distributed divers pieces of Gold amongst the <HI>Franks</HI> that came with him out of the Fort, thereby to intice them to follow him, under a pre∣tence to accompany him to <HI>Deli</HI> to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> as having a great desire to see that brave Man, who had defended himself so valiantly.</P>
<P>There remain'd now none of <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Family but <HI>Soliman Chekou,</HI> who was not easily to be fetch'd from <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> if the <HI>Raja</HI> had continu'd in his first Resolution; but the private Correspondence of <HI>Jesseingue,</HI> the Promises and Threats of <HI>Oranch∣zef,</HI> the Death of <HI>Darasja</HI> and the other <HI>Rajas</HI> his Neighbors, who had been gain'd, and made Pre∣parations by Order from <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> and at his Charge, at last stagger'd the Fidelity of this perfi∣dious Protector,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Soliman Che∣kou</HI> taken and imprison'd.</NOTE> and made him consent to their Demands. <HI>Soliman Chekou</HI> inform'd thereof, fled through uninhabited Countreys and desolate Mountains, to the greater <HI>Tibet;</HI> but the <HI>Raja</HI>'s Son closely pursuing him, caus'd Stones to be thrown at him, which wounding the poor Prince, so disa∣bled him, that he was forc'd to yield to his Ene∣mies Mercy, who carry'd him to <HI>Deli,</HI> where he was imprison'd in <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> a little Fortress, the same Place wherein they formerly had put <HI>Morad∣beck.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is brought to the Court.</NOTE><HI>Oranchzef,</HI> to observe the same method as he had done in the Case of <HI>Darasja,</HI> that none might doubt but that it was <HI>Soliman Chekou</HI> himself, he commanded him, in the presence of all his No∣bles, to be brought to the Court: At the entrance of the Gate his Fetters were taken off from his Legs, leaving onely those on his Hands.</P>
<P>When this young and noble Person, being ex∣ceeding beautiful and well proportion'd, was seen to enter the Gates, many <HI>Omrahs</HI> could not with∣hold their Tears. In like manner it is said, that all the Ladies of the Court which had leave to see him come in, fell a weeping. <HI>Oranchzef</HI> himself also seeming to be affected with his Misfortunes, began to comfort him, saying to him, <HI>That he need not fear any thing, for no harm should come unto him, but that he should on the contrary be well treated; and therefore</HI> (said he) <HI>be of good chear, God was powerful, and would be merciful; That he had taken off his Fa∣ther for no other reason, but because he turn'd</HI> Caffer, <HI>a Man without Religion.</HI> Whereupon the young Prince return'd him the <HI>Salam,</HI> or Thanks, with his Hands down to the Ground, and then lifting them as well as he could up to his Head, according to the Custom of the Countrey,. Moreover, he re∣quested <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> that he would let him drink the <HI>Poust,</HI> that he might instantly die, he being very willing to submit to his Fate. But <HI>Oranchzef</HI> pro∣mis'd him publickly, that he would not make him drink it, therefore he might rest satisfi'd, and not entertain any said thoughts about it. This said, he once more repeated the <HI>Salam;</HI> and after they had ask'd him several Questions in the Name of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> concerning the Elephant which was la∣den with <HI>Ropias</HI> of Gold, taken from him when he went to <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> he was sent to <HI>Govaleor</HI> to the rest.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poust,</HI> what it is.</NOTE>The <HI>Poust</HI> mentioned before, is nothing but Poppy steep'd a Night in Water, being that Po∣tion which those Princes that are kept at <HI>Govaleor,</HI> whose Heads they do not think fit to cut off, are commonly forc'd to drink in a Morning fasting, which enervates and debilitates their Limbs, con∣sumes their Inwards, and makes them die insensi∣bly. With this Potion <HI>Sepe Chekou,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> and <HI>Soliman Chekou,</HI> were poyson'd.</P>
<P>At to what concerns <HI>Moradbeck,</HI> he was put to death after a more cruel manner: for <HI>Oranchzef</HI> observing, that so long as he was in Prison, the Affections of the generality of the People were to∣wards him, he thought it would not be safe for himself to put him to death in private with <HI>Poust,</HI> as he had done the rest, for fear the Vulgar should always be doubtful of his Death, and still believe him to be in Prison, and therefore devis'd the fol∣lowing Crime to accuse him withal.</P>
<P>The Children of a very rich <HI>Sahed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moradbeck</HI>'s Death.</NOTE> whom <HI>Mo∣radbeck</HI> had put to death in <HI>Amadabad,</HI> onely to get his Goods when he rais'd his Army, and forcibly took or borrow'd all the Money from the Mer∣chants, made complaint thereof in the publick As∣sembly, and demanded his Head for the Blood of their Father, which not one of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> durst contradict; first, because he was a <HI>Sahed,</HI> that is one of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Relations, to whom for that rea∣son they shew'd great respect; and secondly, be∣cause they all observ'd <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Design herein, and that it was onely a meer pretence to put him to death publickly; so that the Head of him who had kill'd their Father was given them
<PB N="192" REF="142"/>without any farther Examination. And there∣upon an express Order was immediately sent to <HI>Govaleor</HI> to Behead him.</P>
<P>And now there remain'd no other Thorn in <HI>Oranchzef</HI>'s Foot, but <HI>Sultan Chasausa,</HI> who still defended himself in <HI>Bengala;</HI> yet he was at last forc'd to submit to the Power and Good Fortune of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who sent so many Forces to <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> that he at last encompass'd him on both sides of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and all the Isles which lye in the Mouth thereof, which forc'd <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> to flie to <HI>Dake,</HI> the last City of <HI>Bengala,</HI> lying on the Sea-shore. And here comes the Conclusion of this whole Tragedy:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chasausa</HI> flies for refuge to the King of <HI>Racan.</HI></NOTE> For this Prince being de∣stitute of Ships to put to Sea, and not knowing whether to betake himself, sent his eldest Son <HI>Sultan Banque</HI> to the King of <HI>Racan,</HI> or <HI>Moy,</HI> a <HI>Hea∣then,</HI> to know whether he would permit him to make his Court his Place of Refuge for some time, and do him the favor, when the <HI>Mousons</HI> or Trade-Winds should come, to furnish him with a Vessel to <HI>Mecha,</HI> that from thence he might pass into some Parts of <HI>Turkey</HI> or <HI>Persia.</HI> The King return'd <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> word, That he should be very welcom to him, and have all possible Assi∣stance: With which Answer <HI>Sultan Banque</HI> re∣turn'd to <HI>Dake,</HI> the King having also supply'd with several Galleys, (Mann'd with <HI>Franks, viz. Re∣negade Portuguese,</HI> and other <HI>Christians,</HI> who had enter'd into the foremention'd King's Service, and maintain'd themselves by Plundering of the <HI>Lower Bengale.</HI>) In these Gallies <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> Em∣barquing, with his whole Family, <HI>viz.</HI> his Wife, his three Sons, and Daughters, set Sail; and ar∣riving at their desir'd Port, they were courteously receiv'd, and supplied with all things which the Countrey afforded, at the King's Charge. Some Months being past,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He requests a Ship to tran∣sport him to <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cha,</HI> but is deny'd.</NOTE> the Season for the Trade-Winds came; but he could not obtain the Ship that was promis'd him, though he desir'd it upon no other account but for his Money; for he want∣ed not as yet either Gold, Silver, or Precious Stones, but had rather too much of them, his Riches being the occasion of his Destruction, or at least a great Inducement thereunto: For these <HI>Barbarian</HI> Kings are destitute of all true No∣bleness, neither do they regard Fidelity or Pro∣mises, minding nothing but their present Interest, and never considering the Inconveniences and Mischiefs that may befal them for their Perfidi∣ousnes. To get out of their Hands, one must ei∣ther be very Powerful, or at least have nothing that may tempt their Avarice. And the more <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> implor'd for a Ship, the further he was from having it; the King on the contrary beginning to grow very cool, and complaining that he did not come to see him.</P>
<P>It is not known whether <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> look'd upon it as a dishonor to himself, and a thing be∣low him, to go and visit a King; or whether he fear'd that he might secure his Person when he should come into his Palace, and so make himself Master of all his Treasure, and deliver him to <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> who promis'd him great Sums of Money, and many other considerable Advanta∣ges, to do the same: However it was, he would not go thither, but sent his Son <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> who being come near the King's House, shew'd his Li∣berality to the People, throwing handfuls of <HI>Ropias</HI> of Gold and Silver amongst them; and coming before the King, he presented him with several Embroider'd Coats, and wrought Pieces of Gold, beset with Precious Stones, and excus'd his Father <HI>Chasausa</HI>'s not coming, by alledging he was in∣dispos'd; desiring him also to furnish him with a Ship, and perform the Promises which he had made to him: But all this avail'd not; for five or six days after, the King sent to <HI>Sultan Chausasa,</HI> to request one of his Daughters in Marriage, which he not granting, so highly incens'd this Barba∣rous Prince, that he suffer'd <HI>Chasausa</HI> to be driven to great Extremities, the Season for putting to Sea being now past: When, behold, he took a strange Resolution, which may give a great Example of what Despair can do.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Plot a∣gainst the King of <HI>Ra∣can</HI> disco∣ver'd.</NOTE>Though this King of <HI>Racan</HI> was a <HI>Heathen,</HI> yet he had abundance of <HI>Mahumetans</HI> in his Domini∣ons, which either retir'd thither voluntarily, or have been brought thither as Slaves by the <HI>Franks:</HI> These <HI>Chasausa</HI> privately gain'd to be of his Party, and with two or three hundred Men which he had yet remaining, he resolv'd one day to fall unexpectedly upon the <HI>Barbarian</HI>'s House, and putting all to the Sword, make himself Ma∣ster of <HI>Racan:</HI> Which indeed was a very bold Enterprise, and had more of the Desperado in it than of a Prudent Man; yet the thing was not impossible to be done: But the day before the Stroke was to be given, the Plot being discover'd, quite overthrew <HI>Chasausa</HI>'s Design, and in a short time prov'd the occasion of his Ruine: For see∣ing there was no way to recover himself, he at∣tempted to flie to <HI>Pegu,</HI> a thing in a manner im∣possible, by reason of the vast Mountains and Fo∣rests which he was to pass: Besides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is pursu'd and defeated.</NOTE> he was im∣mediately pursu'd so close, that he was overtaken the same day he fled; when defending himself very valiantly, he kill'd a great number of <HI>Indi∣ans;</HI> but they at last press'd upon him in such Multitudes, that he was forc'd to quit the Battel. <HI>Sultan Banque</HI> being not so far advanc'd as his Fa∣thers defended himself also like a Lion; but after having receiv'd divers Wounds, with Stones which the <HI>Indians</HI> threw at him, he was taken Prisoner, and carried away, with his two younger Brothers, Sisters, and Mother.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncertain what became of him.</NOTE>Some say, That <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> himself fled, with his Wife, one Eunuch, and two other Per∣sons, to the top of a Mountain, where he re∣ceiv'd a Wound in his Head, by a Stone, which strook him down; but recovering himself again, and the Eunuch having bound up the Wound with his <HI>Turbant,</HI> they afterwards escap'd by the shelter of the Woods.</P>
<P>Others affirm, That <HI>Sultan Chasausa</HI> was found amongst the dead, but was not well known: And this Story is related so many several ways, that it is very difficult to know justly what became of him. But most certain it is, that this uncertainty of his death hath been the occasion of the several Alarms which afterwards hapned at <HI>Deli:</HI> For at one time it was reported, That he was arriv'd at <HI>Maslipatan,</HI> to joyn with the Kings of <HI>Golconda</HI> and <HI>Visiapour:</HI> At another time, That he had pass'd in sight of <HI>Surat</HI> with two Ships, carrying the red Ensigns which the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> or <HI>Siam</HI> had given him: Soon after, That he was in <HI>Persia,</HI> and that he had been seen in <HI>Schiras;</HI> and then in <HI>Candahor,</HI> ready to enter the Kingdom of <HI>Cabul. Oranchzef</HI> himself said one day smiling, <HI>That</HI> Sultan Cha∣sausa <HI>was at last become an</HI> Agy, <HI>or Pilgrim;</HI> as if he would say, <HI>He was gone to Mecha.</HI> And at this very day there are many Persons who maintain, That he was return'd from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Persia,</HI>

Besides which, it is reported, That not long after his Defeat his Sword and <HI>Canger,</HI> or Ponyard, had been found; so that it is credible, if he died not on the Place, he did not long sur∣vive, but became the Prey of some Robbers or ravenous Beasts, with which the Forests of these Countreys abound.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chasausa</HI>'s fa∣mily ill treat∣ed, but at last pardon'd, yet soon after ex∣tir pated.</NOTE> But whatever became of <HI>Chasausa,</HI> after this his last Design, his whole Fa∣mily was put into Prison, where they were very ill treated, but after some time again set at li∣berty, and us'd more mildly, when the King cau∣sing <HI>Chasausa</HI>'s eldest Daughter to be brought to him, married her, the Kings Mother endeavoring likewise to have married <HI>Sultan Banque.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while the Servants of <HI>Sultan Banque,</HI> with some of the foremention'd <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> laid another Plot, not unlike the former; but the day being come, one of the Conspirators being half drunk, began the Work too soon, and so spoil'd the whole Design. But this incens'd the King so exceedingly against the unfortunate Family of <HI>Chasausa,</HI> that he commanded the same to be quite rooted out, sparing not so much as the Daughter he had married, though she was suppos'd to be with Child. <HI>Sultan Banque</HI> and his Brothers had their Heads cut off with blunt Axes, and the Wo∣men being lock'd up in several Rooms, died mi∣serably with Hunger.</P>
<P>And thus ended the War which ambition of Rule had kindled amongst these four Brothers, af∣ter the expiration of five or six Years, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Anno</HI> 1655, till <HI>Anno</HI> 1660, or 1661, and left <HI>Oranchzef</HI> in the peaceable Possession of this mighty Empire.</P>
<P>And now Ambassadors were sent to <HI>Oranchzef</HI> from several Neighboring Princes and States,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oranchzef</HI> sick.</NOTE> to congratulate his happy Victories; but having scarce Reign'd two Years, he fell sick of a violent Fever, insomuch that it was reported he was dead, and several were contriving to release his Father <HI>Schach Jehan;</HI> which to prevent, and to unde∣ceive the People, he caus'd himself, in the height of his Distemper, four several days to be carried into the Assembly of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> where calling for Pen, Ink, and Paper, he wrote to <HI>Etbarcan,</HI> and sent for the Great Seal, which was kept by <HI>Raichenara Begum,</HI> and commonly enclos'd in a small Bag, seal'd with a Seal he always wore about his Arm, fearing she had already made use of it for her Designs: But soon after recovering, he settled all things in good Order, preferr'd those that had assisted, and been faithful to him in the Wars, especially <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> whom, after he had vanquish'd <HI>Chasausa,</HI> and drove him to the Sea side, as was before mention'd, he made <HI>Mir Ul Omrah</HI> (which in this Realm is the highest Degree of Honor any of the Kings Favorites can arrive at) and also Governor of <HI>Bengala;</HI> and his Son <HI>Mahomet Emircan</HI> was made <HI>Great Bakchis,</HI> that is, <HI>General of the Horse,</HI> and the second or third Place in the Kingdom.

<P>Many other Remarkable Passages hapned in this Empire from <HI>Anno</HI> 1661, to 1667; of which we will only mention these sew: <HI>viz.</HI> In the Year 1664, on the fifth of <HI>February,</HI> the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Vice-Roy of <HI>Surat,</HI> call'd <HI>Enachat Chan,</HI> was inform'd by one of his Officers which liv'd two Leagues from the City, That a great Army was advancing towards the Town, the General whereof call'd himself <HI>A Servant to the Mogol,</HI> and pretended to March with ten thousand Men to the City <HI>Amada∣bad:</HI> but it afterwards appeared that this was only a Pretence, he being in truth a great Robber, nam'd <HI>Sawasi:</HI> Which not a little amazing the Governor, he caus'd immediately the Bridges which lay cross the Moat that inclos'd the City to be pull'd down, notwithstanding it was dry in most places; neither was there one Gun planted for a Defence, which made him send to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> there residing, for aid in this ex∣tremity; which seem'd not a little strange to them: for they having not above forty Men apiece in their Factories, were forc'd to take each seventy or eighty Men more into their Service. The next Morning <HI>Sawasi</HI> was advanc'd within a League and a half of <HI>Surat,</HI> where resting near the Village <HI>Utena,</HI> the Governor sent Messengers to request him, That he would not come any nearer the Ci∣ty, because many of the Inhabitants fled already for fear, and that the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> would resent it very ill if he should offer the contrary: But <HI>Sawasi</HI> not regarding this, kept the Messengers in custody, and still drew nearer the City, in which about midnight there hapned a sudden Fire, which burnt so furiously, that it consum'd a considerable num∣ber of Houses.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Surat</HI> taken by a Robber.</NOTE> <HI>Sawasi</HI>'s People taking this op∣portunity, march'd into the Town without any resistance, though they might easily have been oppos'd. The Governor having ten thousand Horse of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s, went with them and his Chief Officers to the Castle, whence he fired several Guns, but did more mischief to the Houses than the Enemy, who minded nothing but Plun∣der, breaking open Windows, and Chests, which lasted several days, till <HI>Sawasi</HI> having gotten a vast Treasure, left the Place, saying, <HI>Long have I wish'd to get into</HI> Oranchzef<HI>'s Beard, which I have now obtain'd:</HI> For this rich and brave City <HI>Surat</HI> is for its Beauty and Stateliness, by the <HI>Moors</HI> call'd <HI>The King's, or Mogol's Beard.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Robber taken, and committed to Prison; but escapes.</NOTE>The <HI>Mogol</HI> seeing what a mighty Enemy, Rob∣ber, and Destroyer of his Countrey <HI>Sawasi</HI> was, and that he could not hope to overcome him by force, he having already an Army of a hundred thousand Men, he thought to work that by Policy which his Power could not effect; and therefore to get him into his custody, he made him large of∣fers of Honors and Preferment, promising him the third Place in his Realm; which Design ta∣king effect according to his desires, he was no sooner come to Court, but he was there appre∣hended, and committed to Prison: But about three Months after he cunningly made his escape; and although <HI>Oranchzef</HI> sent Agents after him, to excuse his being kept a Prisoner, and promising upon his Royal Word that he would prefer him to a high Degree of Honor, yet he having been once caught in the Snare, would not be taken again, but reply'd, <HI>That he thank'd him for his Proffers; but he had rather be his own Master than another Man's Servant; and that at one time or other he would pay</HI> Oranchzef <HI>for his kind Entertainment;</HI> and so went again with his Army to <HI>Wingerla,</HI> a Place which he had taken from the <HI>Mogol.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ananias,</HI> from the information of a <HI>Persian</HI> call'd <HI>Anvadat,</HI> saith that the King of <HI>Balassy</HI> first gave this Countrey to the <HI>Persian,</HI> for assisting him a∣gainst the <HI>Mogollans</HI> and <HI>Tartars;</HI> yet <HI>Jarrick</HI> tells us, that the King of <HI>Candahar,</HI> whom he calls <HI>Candazar,</HI> gave his Realm to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> when he was not able to defend it any longer against <HI>Abduxan,</HI> King of <HI>Usbeck.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Persia</HI> himself pretends, in a Letter written to the <HI>Chans</HI> of <HI>Sciras,</HI> that the Province of <HI>Candahar</HI> always belong'd to the Crown of <HI>Per∣sia,</HI> and that the <HI>Mogol</HI> had unjustly taken it from him; which is confirm'd by <HI>F. Bernier,</HI> who saith, that the <HI>Mogol</HI> King <HI>Ecbar</HI> taking <HI>Candahar</HI> from the <HI>Persians</HI> by force, kept the same during his Life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">When it be∣came subject to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> and its several vicis∣situdes.</NOTE><HI>Anno</HI> 1618. the City of <HI>Candahar</HI> became sub∣ject to the <HI>Great Mogol:</HI> for the <HI>Persian</HI> Governor thereof, whether out of dislike to the <HI>Persian</HI> Go∣vernment, or whether Brib'd with a great Sum of Money, selling the Countrey and Garrisons to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> entred into his Service according to the Examples of other <HI>Persians, Chorazans,</HI> and <HI>Usbecks,</HI> who Listed themselves in the foremen∣tion'd Prince's Service. The <HI>Persian</HI> hath often de∣manded the same again by Ambassadors, as in the Year 1622. a little before it was re-taken by <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> who march'd thither some Months before with a mighty Army, to Fight against the <HI>Great Mogol.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Letter which the King sent to his Peers, the City <HI>Candahar</HI> was not taken by violence, but the Townsmen surrendred them∣selves, and most of the Inhabitants de serted the same with all their Goods, because they were sensible that the City could not be defended a∣gainst so vast an Army, there being not above eight hundred in it.</P>
<P>After this <HI>Candahar</HI> fell again into the hands of <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> not by force of Arms, but by means of the Governor <HI>Alimerdancan,</HI> who also surren∣dred himself, he having before been suspected of Treason by the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> who had sent for him to give an Account of his Transactions.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1649. in <HI>February,</HI> the Fortress <HI>Candahar,</HI> after a Siege of forty days, and discharging of ma∣ny great Guns (which made two Breaches in the City Walls,) was taken again by <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> the Second. The <HI>Indostans</HI> had not surrendred the Fort so soon, had they not wanted Provisions and Gunpowder.</P>
<P>It is a wonder that this Fortress of <HI>Candahar,</HI> standing on the Borders of two mighty Kingdoms, and having been so often contested for, was not better furnish'd with Ammunition and Provisions; but perhaps the <HI>Mogol</HI> suppos'd that his Ambassa∣dors, whom <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> put off with Delays, would have concluded a Peace, the Soldiers in Garrison else fighting very valiantly, insomuch that they could not be discern'd to abate any thing of their courage, notwithstanding the forementi∣on'd want.</P>
<P>After the conquering of the City, a <HI>Persian</HI> Horseman or <HI>Quizilbasci,</HI> was commanded to stand upon the Guard without the Gate, till such time as all the <HI>Indostan</HI> Soldiers were come out of the fame, as a testimony of the <HI>Persians</HI> Victory a∣gainst the <HI>Indostans:</HI> he was Accoutred in this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> On his Back hung a Tyger's Skin; on his Head, in stead of a <HI>Turbant,</HI> he wore a round Copper Helmet, with a Plume of Feathers, hang∣ing down behind on both sides of the same; in his Hand he held a Truncheon.</P>
<P>On the fifth day after the Conquest, the <HI>Indo∣stan</HI> Soldiers march'd out of the City to <HI>Cabul,</HI> ly∣ing eight days Journey from <HI>Candahar:</HI> They were, according to the Agreement, not allow'd to take any thing with them, more than what each Man could carry on his Horse, and not without being search'd, because some things were forbid∣den them to meddle with. The Citizens for the most part promising to be obedient to the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> staid in the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Myrub Chan,</HI> who had conquer'd the Fortress <HI>Bust,</HI> was made Governor of <HI>Candahar,</HI> and charg'd on pain of Death to be very careful in the preser∣vation of it.</P>
<P>After <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> had conquer'd the City and Fortress of <HI>Candahar,</HI> and given order for repairing of the demolish'd Walls, he went with his Army back to the City of <HI>Herat.</HI></P>
<P>Some days after <HI>Myrub Chan,</HI> the new-made Governor of <HI>Candahar,</HI> sent a flying Post to the King, to inform him, That it was certainly re∣ported the <HI>Mogol</HI> was coming towards <HI>Candahar</HI> with six hundred thousand Men, and that one of his Sons was already entred into the City <HI>Cabul</HI> with ten thousand Men; which being affirm'd by several Messengers that came one after another, the King sent his <HI>Chans</HI> back with the Army im∣mediately to <HI>Candahar,</HI> where the <HI>Persians</HI> in good order expected the <HI>Mogol</HI> to give him Battel: The <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Army coming thither three days after, Encamp'd at first about half a Mile distant from the <HI>Persians,</HI> whilst the Trumpets sounding, the
<PB N="196" REF="146"/><HI>Indostans</HI> with loud shouts fell in amongst their Troops, which consisted most in Oxen, and some ordinary <HI>Tartarian</HI> Horses, the <HI>Persian</HI> Horses being too dear for a common <HI>Mogol</HI> Trooper to buy. The Battel being very fierce at first, the <HI>Persians</HI> behav'd themselves very valiantly; and when their Reserve came up with them, they unawares fell upon both Wings of the Enemy, breaking their Ranks, and killing their General (who had behav'd himself nobly, but ventur'd too far a∣mongst the <HI>Persians,</HI>) and putting them to flight, kill'd great numbers of them in the pursuit; yet there were about six thousand <HI>Persian,</HI> and not above two thousand <HI>Indostans</HI> slain in this Battel. The <HI>Indostans</HI> left all their Ammunition and Pro∣visions to the disposal of the <HI>Persians,</HI> whilst the <HI>Mogol</HI> having no mind to adventure any farther, march'd back with his Army. The <HI>Persian Chans</HI> leaving half their Army before <HI>Candahar,</HI> En∣camp'd themselves before the City, and march'd back to <HI>Herat</HI> with the other half.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Candahar</HI> Be∣sieged.</NOTE>Whilst the <HI>Persians</HI> possess'd <HI>Candahar,</HI> it was twice Besieg'd in vain by the <HI>Mogol Schach Jehan;</HI> the first time it escap'd being taken, partly by ill Conduct, and private Correspondence of the <HI>Per∣sian Omrahs</HI> that were in the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Service, and the most eminent at his Court, and partly by the Respect they bare to their native Prince; for they all behav'd themselves very ill, and would not fol∣low the <HI>Raja Roup,</HI> who had already planted his Standards on the Walls towards the side of the Mountains. The second time it was hapned not to be taken by means of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who would not Storm that part of the Wall where the <HI>Eng∣lish, French, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> had planted great Guns; for which this was his reason, <HI>viz.</HI> because he would not have it to be said, that the Fortress of <HI>Candahar</HI> should be conquer'd in <HI>Daras∣ja</HI>'s time, who was the first Agitator of this De∣sign, and at that time resident with his Father in the City of <HI>Cabul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Schach Jehan</HI> some years before these last Trou∣bles, was also resolv'd to Besiege <HI>Candahar</HI> a third time, had not <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> and <HI>Aly Merdaman</HI> dis∣swaded him from it, and advis'd him to send his Forces towards <HI>Decan.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, King <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> like his Predecessors, in these later years made Preparations to Besiege <HI>Candahar,</HI> whether because he was provok'd there∣to by Letters which the King of <HI>Persia</HI> had sent to him, or for the bad Entertainment and Disgrace which his Ambassador <HI>Tarbietcan</HI> receiv'd from him is uncertain; but being inform'd of the King of <HI>Persia</HI>'s Death, he retreated, alledging (as some say) that he would not War against a Child: but this seems not very probable, for <HI>Schach Soliman,</HI> who succeeded his Father, was then twenty five years old.</P>

Mean while <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> King of <HI>Persia</HI> went from thence to his grand Army at <HI>Candahar</HI> ten days Journey, with the <HI>Cafili</HI> or Caravan from <HI>Calabust.</HI> Moreo∣ver, they cast up onely one Battery (having no convenient place to raise any more,) from whence they daily play'd their great Guns at the Walls, being continually answer'd not onely with great but small Shot. This continu'd one and twenty days, when having made a Breach in the Wall, they Storm'd three several times, yet were beaten off with the loss of three hundred Men. On the same day a <HI>Tzapor,</HI> or Royal Messenger, came with a Letter to the General; who in the presence of two other <HI>Chans</HI> opening the same with great Re∣verence, they read it one after another: Where∣upon all the prime Commanders, as also some of the chief <HI>Quizilbascies,</HI> being sent for, the Letter was publickly read before them all; the Con∣tents whereof was to this effect: <Q><HI>Myrub,</HI> do you eat the King's Bread and Salt, and not press on with the Souldiers under your Command? Remember that you formerly surrendred <HI>Cala∣bust</HI> to the <HI>Mogol:</HI> Cleanse your self from your Crime, and look you gain me the Fortress in a few days, which if you do not, expect to re∣ceive a Sword from me.</Q> The next night they Storm'd more fiercely than before, and <HI>Myrub Chan,</HI> whether out of fear of the threatned Punish∣ment, or out of Despair, press'd on daily more and more, nay, resolv'd to lose all his Men rather than break up the Siege: but after a sharp Encounter the <HI>Persians</HI> forc'd their way into the City, and slew above ten thousand Men, the rest flying into the upper Castle; the Governor of which, nam'd <HI>Bourdel Chan,</HI> coming down alone with his Sword drawn, was espy'd by <HI>Myrub Chan,</HI> who saluted him with the word <HI>Hoschammedi;</HI> but <HI>Bourdel Chan</HI> making no answer, still advanc'd to∣wards him, and laying down his Sword, fell at <HI>Myrub Chan</HI>'s Feet, who bid him rise up; then <HI>Boardel</HI> standing up, said, <HI>There lies my Sword at your Feet; I am conquer'd, I am your Slave, do with me what you please onely spare my Wife and Children. Myrub Chan</HI> hereupon commanded his Men not to hurt him, nor any that belong'd to him, and stretch∣ing out his Hands, laid them under <HI>Bourdel Chan</HI>'s, and withal kissed him. Then causing the Trum∣pets to be sounded, he commanded all the <HI>Indostan</HI> Soldiers that were remaining, to lay down their Arms, and acknowledge themselves the King's Slaves, which if they refus'd to do, they must ex∣pect no Quarter: But the <HI>Indostans,</HI> not regard∣ing this Threatning, would not lay down their Arms, and so were every Man kill'd.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Quizilbascies</HI> deoculated the slain <HI>Indostans,</HI> cut off their Hands, and then flead and stuft up the Skins: The Heads they carry'd on their Launces, as Trophies of their Victory; some carried four or five stuck one above another on long Pikes to <HI>Candahar;</HI> for amongst the <HI>Per∣sians,</HI> he who brings home most of his Enemies Heads, is not onely accounted a brave Soldier, but also advanc'd to the highest Offices.</P>

<P>THe Kingdom of <HI>Caximir,</HI> or (according to some) <HI>Cascimir</HI> and <HI>Cachmire,</HI> by <HI>Merca∣tor</HI> taken to be the ancient <HI>Arachosia</HI> or <HI>Archotis</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> and by <HI>Herbert,</HI> for the ancient <HI>Sogdiana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Borders.</NOTE> borders in the North, at Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> in the North-West, at the Province of <HI>Banchish,</HI> the <HI>Indus</HI> onely separating them; in the South-East, at <HI>Penjab;</HI> in the West, at <HI>Cabul;</HI> and Nor∣therly, at the Kingdom of <HI>Maurenahar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jarrick</HI> conterminates this Kingdom with that of <HI>Rebat.</HI> It is but a small Countrey, and lies (as <HI>Texeira</HI> tells us) fifteen days Journey from <HI>Lahor,</HI> and (according to <HI>Herbert</HI>) in 41 Degrees and 9 Minutes Northern Latitude, about three hundred Miles from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jarrich</HI> gives the Name of <HI>Syranacar</HI> both to the chief City of this Kingdom, and to the Countrey it self, lying in 30 Degrees Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>About three Leagues from the City is a Lake or Pool of sweet Water, about fifteen Miles in circumference, Navigable for great Ships, yet not above half a League broad. In the middle of it lies a pleasant artificial Island, with a Royal Ban∣quetting-house therein; whither (as <HI>Jarrick</HI> af∣firms) the King resorts, when he intends to recre∣ate himself in catching of wild Geese and Swans.</P>
<P>Through the midst of this Lake, as also through the Countrey, glides the Stream <HI>Behat</HI> or <HI>Bhad,</HI> which by its trending or meeandring Bays makes many Islands, and at last unites it self not far from <HI>Jahor</HI> with the River <HI>Indus,</HI> or (as others say) with the <HI>Ganges;</HI> which last is somewhat improbable, because of its distance towards the East.</P>
<P>Another River call'd <HI>Chanab,</HI> by <HI>Jarrick, Che∣nao,</HI> and by <HI>Terry, Nilab,</HI> having also its original in this Countrey, unites it self likewise with the <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey abounds in Rice, Wheat, and other Provisions; and also hath plenty of Grass, Woods, Gardens, and Springs. Of the Roots of their Mulberry-trees they plant Vines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Coun∣trey formerly lay under Water.</NOTE>The ancient Histories of the Kings of <HI>Caximir</HI> make mention, that this Countrey was formerly a great Lake, and that a certain ancient Man call'd <HI>Cacheb</HI> open'd a Passage for the Water through the Mountain of <HI>Baramoule:</HI> But this seems to be incredible; yet not but that this Countrey was formerly overflow'd with Water; but to open a Passage for it through the foremention'd Moun∣tain, is a thing altogether impossible, the Moun∣tain being so very high and broad; rather an Earthquake, to which this Place is very subject, opening the Earth, swallow'd up a part of the Mountain, and so open'd a Passage for the Wa∣ter. But however it was dreyn'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Extent and Situation.</NOTE> <HI>Caximir</HI> is no more a Lake, but at present a most fertile Soil, a∣bout eighteen Leagues long and three or four broad, interlac'd with many little Hills. It is the farthest part of <HI>Indostan</HI> to the Northward from <HI>Lahor,</HI> and inclos'd by Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> the Moun∣tains of the Kingdom of great and little <HI>Tibet,</HI> and those of the <HI>Raja Gamon,</HI> which are its next Neigh∣bors. The first Mountains that inclose it, <HI>viz.</HI> those which lie nearest the Plains, are of an indif∣ferent heighth, and overgrown with Trees and Grass, which serve for Pasturage for divers sorts of Beasts, as Oxen, Cows, Sheep, Goats, Horses, Stags, Hares, and a certain Beast which produces Musk; as also Bees in great abundance. But there are (which is a strange thing in <HI>India</HI>) no Serpents, Tygers, Bears, nor Lions, or but very rarely, to be found here. Beyond these indifferent high Mountains rise others, which being very high, are cover'd all the year with Snow, and
<PB N="200" REF="148"/>reaching above the Clouds, and the usual foggy Damps, carry upon their tops calm and serene Weather. These Mountains of <HI>Caximir</HI> cannot be travell'd without great difficulty with Camels, they being so very steep and craggy.</P>
<P>Eleven or twelve days Journey from <HI>Lahor,</HI> and five from <HI>Caximir,</HI> are the Mountains <HI>Bember,</HI> which are high, spiry, black, and barren, and are as a mighty Wall of that part of the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Heat in <HI>March,</HI> and the effects of it.</NOTE>Between <HI>Lahor</HI> and <HI>Caximir,</HI> near <HI>Bember,</HI> it is intolerable hot in <HI>March,</HI> which proceeds from those high Mountains that lie Northerly, and pre∣vent or break off all the cool Winds which come from that side, and reflecting the Sun-beams back on the Fields, scorch and burn them; neither are there any Clouds seen, nor one Blast of Wind stirring, insomuch that the Horses often fainting, fall down under their Riders. Strangers that tra∣vel this way, break out full of red Pimples, which prick like Needles, all over their Bodies; nay, many of them die of the extream Heat.</P>
<P>When you travel in <HI>March</HI> out of the Moun∣tains of <HI>Bember</HI> into those of <HI>Caximir,</HI> you come out of a torrid into a more temperate Climate; and that which is more strange, Travellers find so great an alteration, as if they were transported out of <HI>India</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> the Fields being overgrown with all kind of <HI>European</HI> Plants, Grain, and Herbs, except Hyssop, Thyme, and Rosemary, the Woods full of Elms, Ash, Chesnut, and Palm-trees, whenas there is not one Shrub to be seen in the scorch'd Fields of <HI>Indostan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference of Air in one Mountain.</NOTE>A days Journey and a half from <HI>Bember,</HI> is a Mountain, which on both sides is overgrown with Plants, but with this distinction, <HI>viz.</HI> on that side which respects the South towards <HI>India,</HI> is a mix∣ture both of <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>European</HI> Plants, but on the North side grow none but <HI>European,</HI> just as if the Southern part of the Mountain did participate with the Temperature of the Air of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>In∣dia,</HI> and the North side onely of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the Valleys and deep Precipices between these high Mountains lie hundreds of Trees one above another, some wither'd, and others rotten with age; and also many young ones, which are sprung out of the Roots of the rotten. There are likewise some scorch'd Trees, either set on fire by Lightning, or by the motion of the Wind in the midst of Summer, which causeth them to clash one against the other, or (as the Inhabitants say) they take fire of themselves when grown old and dry.</P>
<P>The highest Mountain of all is call'd <HI>Pirepen∣jale,</HI> from which at a great distance you discover the Countrey of <HI>Cachemire;</HI> and travelling over this Mountain in <HI>March,</HI> you are sensible in less than an hours time both of Summer and Winter; for in ascending it your are exceedingly perplex'd with the intolerable heat of the Sun; but coming to the top, you find frozen Snow, through which you must cut your way, being often so extraordi∣nary cold, that it chills the Traveller.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An odd Her∣mite.</NOTE><HI>Anno</HI> 1664. <HI>F. Bernier</HI> travelling over this Mountain, found an ancient Recluse on the top thereof, who had dwelt on the same ever since the Time of <HI>Schach Selim;</HI> his Religion was not known to any; but he had the power (as the In∣habitants affirm) to perform great Miracles, <HI>viz.</HI> to cause Thunder, Lightning, Wind, Hail, Rain, and Snow, whensoever he pleas'd: He appear'd to <HI>Bernier,</HI> who went to visit him in his Cave, like a Salvage with a long grey Beard, asking Alms of him, and desir'd that his Pitchers, which he had set together on a great Stone, might be fill'd with Water; after which he beckned with his Hand to him and his Company, that they should not stop, but pass over the Mountain with all the speed they could, and frown'd at those who stood still or made any noise, alledging that it would occasion great Tempests there; and told <HI>Bernier,</HI> that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> had done well in not suffering any to make a noise there, as also his Father <HI>Schach Jehan;</HI> but that <HI>Schach Selim</HI> scorning his Advice, caus'd Drums to be beaten, and Trumpets to be sounded there; whereupon there arose such a mighty Tempest, that he despair'd of getting alive from thence.</P>
<P>In or between the Mountains which belong to <HI>Cachemire,</HI> are many fertile Plains, and amongst others, one which pays Hides and Wooll for Tri∣bute, which the Governor sends for yearly.</P>
<P>The Women here are very handsom, chaste,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women handsom.</NOTE> and Laborious.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Cachemire</HI> go yearly from Mountain to Mountain to buy up the Wooll, of which they make a certain Stuff call'd <HI>Chales.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet another Place very remote from <HI>Cachemire,</HI> which also pays Tribute in Hides and Wooll, and possesses very many pleasant and fruitful small Plains and Valleys, which produce Wheat, Rice, Apples, Pears, Apricocks, Melons, and Grapes, of which the Owners make excellent Wine.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants have often refus'd to pay Tri∣bute, on the account of the troublesom, and almost inaccessible Ways that lead into their Countrey; but there have ever been means found to get into their Jurisdiction, to reduce them to Obedience.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the Mountains which lie farther off, and not under the Jurisdiction of <HI>Cachemire,</HI> are very pleasant Tracts of Lands, inhabited by a white and well shap'd People, who seldom come from thence.</P>
<P>There are some that are under no King, nor have they any Religion, onely some account it a sin to eat Fish.</P>
<P>Out of all these Mountains rise many Springs and Rivulets, which the Inhabitants convey to their Rice-Fields along great Ditches, which ha∣ving fill'd many lesser, at last make a great naviga∣ble River for Ships of a considerable Burthen. This Stream having pass'd round about the King∣dom, and through the middle of the chief City <HI>Caximir,</HI> seeks a passage out at <HI>Boramoule,</HI> between two spiry Rocks, from whence falling with great force, it receives by the way the Waters of many little Brooks, which also spring out of the Moun∣tains, and at last discharges its Waters near <HI>Attack</HI> in the River <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P>All these Rivulets gliding from the Mountains, make the low Lands exceeding fertile, insomuch that the whole Kingdome is like a Garden, which being all over green, hath here and there some Villages situate amongst the Trees, and is divided into several Beds, Sow'n with Rice, Wheat, and other Grain, besides Saffron and Hemp, inter∣woven with Water-courses, Channels, and some little Lakes and Rivulets, and every where planted with <HI>European</HI> Trees and Flowers, as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Apricocks, Nuts, and Vines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>European</HI> Plants and Herbs here in great abun∣dance.</NOTE>In the private Gardens of this Countrey grow Musk-melons, <HI>Patequos</HI> or Water-melons, Beets, Raddishes, most of our Potherbs, and some which we have not; yet these Fruits are not so good as those in <HI>Europe,</HI> which proceeds rather from the ignorance of Gardners than the Soil; wherefore
<PB N="201" REF="148"/>the <HI>Mogols</HI> have not improperly call'd this Coun∣trey <HI>The Terrestrial Paradice;</HI> neither did the <HI>Great Mogol Ecbar</HI> without just reasons take so much pains to get it from the lawful Kings; and his Son <HI>Schach Selim</HI> was so much taken therewith, that he could not possibly forsake it, often saying, That he would rather lose all his whole Kingdom besides than <HI>Cachemire.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Oranchzef</HI> came <HI>Anno</HI> 1664. from <HI>Deli</HI> to recreate himself in this Countrey in the Month of <HI>March,</HI> all the Poets strove to exceed one ano∣ther in making Verses in praise of the same, which <HI>Oranchzef</HI> receiv'd, rewarding the Authors of them very bountifully.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption of the City and Lake of <HI>Ca∣chemire.</HI></NOTE>The chief Town of this Countrey bears the same Denomination with the Kingdom, and being without Walls, is three quarters of a Mile long, and half a Mile broad. It is situate in a barren Field, about two Leagues from the Mountains, which seem to make a Semi-circle about a Lake of sweet Water, of about four or five Leagues in circumference. This Lake is made by running Springs and Brooks which glide from the Moun∣tains, and discharges its Water through a naviga∣ble Channel, into a River which runs through the middle of the City, and hath two Bridges over it.</P>
<P>This Lake is also full of Islands, which resem∣ble so many pleasant Gardens, with delightful Walks and Arbors, and are surrounded with Pop∣lar and other Trees, which have Leaves about two Foot broad, and are as tall as the Masts of Ships, with Boughs onely on the top like Date-trees.</P>
<P>On the other side of the Lake, upon the hang∣ing of the Mountains, are also abundance of Ban∣quetting-houses and Gardens, for which that place is most convenient, because it hath a delicate Air, a Prospect on the Lake, Islands, and a City, and is full of Springs and Rivulets. The best of all the Gardens being the Kings, is in the <HI>Persian</HI> Lan∣guage call'd <HI>Schach-Limar,</HI> that is, <HI>The King's Gar∣den.</HI> Out of the Lake they go into this Garden through a Channel between two rows of Trees planted along its Banks about five hundred Paces long.</P>
<P>This Channel leads to the King's Sugar-house, which is also in the midst of the Garden, where begins another brave Moat reaching to the upper end of the Garden.</P>
<P>The bottom of the foremention'd Channel is pav'd with Freestone, and the sides thereof rais'd also with the same Stone; in the middle thereof are many Springs of Water, which being in a row fifteen Paces distant one from another, shoot up above the other Water. Moreover, there are Receptacles of Water like Ponds, out of which by means of several Springs the Water rises up in many small Streams, which make divers Figures. This Channel ends at another great Banquetting-house, not much unlike the former.</P>
<P>The foremention'd Pleasure-houses, built al∣most like Cloysters, lying in the middle of the Moat, are surrounded with Water; between the two rows of Poplar Trees they have Galleries or Balconies built round about them, and four Doors opposite one to another; two whereof fronting the two rows of Trees, have two Bridges which lead cross the Water, one on each side; the other two front the two ends of the Channel. Each Summer-house consists in a great Room in the midst of four lesser, which make the Square; the Walls of both the great and small Rooms are richly Gilded and Painted, and full of Inscripti∣ons in large <HI>Persian</HI> Characters; the four Doors are very stately, of large Stones, with two Co∣lumns fetch'd out of the ancient <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples which <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> caus'd to be ruin'd. The value of these Stones is not known, nor of what species they are, unless Marble or Porphyrie.</P>
<P>Most of the Houses are built of Wood two Sto∣reys high, not for want of Stone, there being many old ruin'd <HI>Deuras</HI> or Temples, but for the cheap∣ness, by reason of the abundance of Wood which grows on the adjacent Mountains, from whence it may be fetch'd for a small matter, and carried to the City along a little River.</P>
<P>The Houses built along the River side have each of them a Garden, which hath a Prospect on the Water. The other Houses that do not stand near the River have Gardens also, and many of them a little Channel, which runs into the Lake, into which they can Row from their Houses in small Boats</P>
<P>At one end of the City appears a very steep Mountain, at the foot whereof are many fair Hou∣ses with Gardens, and on the top a <HI>Mosque,</HI> with an Orchard and Garden belonging to it; In re∣gard whereof the Inhabitants in their Language call this Mountain <HI>Hary Porbet,</HI> that is, <HI>Green Mountain.</HI></P>
<P>Opposite to this appears another Mountain, being also crown'd with a <HI>Mosque,</HI> and likewise an ancient Structure, which seems to have been a <HI>Deu∣ra</HI> or <HI>Pagode;</HI> but it is call'd <HI>Tackt Souliman,</HI> that is, <HI>The Throne of Salomon,</HI> because (as the <HI>Mahume∣tans</HI> say) <HI>Salomon</HI> built it when he came to <HI>Cache∣mire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderful Spring.</NOTE>At the Confines of this Kingdom, two or three days Journey from the City <HI>Cachemire,</HI> a Spring near the foot of a Mountain works Wonders (as the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> affirm) in <HI>May,</HI> when the Snow melts on the Mountains, <HI>viz.</HI> it ebbs and flows for fifteen days together three times in a day, in the Morning, at Noon, and at Night; after the first fifteen days its Course is not so exact, and after a Months time it stops altogether the remaining part of the year, except in the time of great and long Rains, when it overflows like other Springs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heathens</HI> have on the Brink of this Spring, a little <HI>Deura</HI> or <HI>Pagode,</HI> built in honor of one of their Idols, wherefore they have call'd it <HI>Send Brary,</HI> as if they would say <HI>Water of Brary,</HI> whither many People go in Pilgrimage to Bathe them∣selves.</P>
<P>Many strange Relations they give concerning the original of this Spring; the Mountain at whose foot it springs, extends in length from North to South, and appears at a distance like a Plain, some∣what rising in the middle, and is about a hundred Paces broad on the top; the North side hath some Verdure, but quickly decaying for want of the Suns influence; the other side on the West is shaded with Trees and Brambles.</P>
<P>Some distance from the High-way is a pleasant Seat of the ancient Kings of <HI>Cachemire,</HI> and at pre∣sent of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> call'd <HI>Achiavela.</HI> The most remarkable thing belonging thereunto is a Spring, whose Water runs round about the Structure, and through all the Gardens in many little Channels. This Spring boyls with such great force out of the Earth, that it may rather be call'd a River than a Spring: The Water thereof is so exceeding cold, that one cannot hold ones Hand in it. The Gar∣den is very large and pleasant, having many brave
<PB N="202" REF="149"/>Walks, and abundance of Fruit-trees, as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Apricocks, and Cherries, and also many Fountains and Fish-ponds.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Achiavel</HI> is another brave Royal Garden, in which are all the foremention'd things for recreation; but it excells in having a Pond full of Fish, which upon calling, or throwing of Bread into the same, appear above Water; the biggest of them have been seen with golden Rings in their Noses, with Mottoes engraven on them, which are said to have been put on by order of the famous <HI>Nourmehalle,</HI> Queen to the <HI>Great Mogol Schach Selim.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Descripti∣on of the <HI>Mosque</HI> at <HI>Baramoulay.</HI></NOTE>About as far from the City <HI>Cachemire</HI> as <HI>Send∣brary,</HI> is a Place call'd <HI>Baramoulay,</HI> where a curious <HI>Mosque</HI> is built, and in it a brave Tomb of one of the famous <HI>Mahumetan Pires,</HI> or Saints, which daily (as the <HI>Moors</HI> relate) works miraculous Cures upon the Sick, which resort in great numbers to the said Tomb.</P>
<P>Near this <HI>Mosque</HI> is a Kitchin, in which are ma∣ny great Copper Kettles full of Flesh and Rice, which perhaps is the Load-stone that draws the Poor thither, and the Miracle which cures them.</P>
<P>On the other side is a Garden, about which are Chambers for the <HI>Mollahs,</HI> who quietly spend their Lives there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderful Stone.</NOTE>There is also another Wonder, <HI>viz.</HI> there is a thick round Stone, which the strongest Man can scarce lift up from the Ground; yet nevertheless eleven Men, by the help of the foremention'd Saint, may take up the same without any trouble, by putting each of them onely one Finger thereto.</P>
<P><HI>Eleven</HI> Mollas (saith <HI>F. Bernier,</HI> who was pre∣sent <HI>Anno</HI> 1664. at the working of this Miracle) <HI>standing close round about the said Stone, with their long Coats prevented the exact discerning after what manner they lifted up the same; but all of them said that they touch'd it not but onely with the ends of their Fingers, and that the Stone felt as light to their ap∣pearance as a Spunge: As for my part, who well ob∣serv'd them, and look'd upon them with a curious Eye, I could not perceive but that they took great pains, and made use of their Thumbs besides their Fingers; yet I forgot not to cry with the rest of the</HI> Mollas <HI>and other Spectators,</HI> Coramet, Coramet, <HI>that is,</HI> A Miracle, A Miracle, <HI>and at the same time gave a</HI> Ropia <HI>to the</HI> Mollas, <HI>earnestly desiring them to let me be one of the eleven which should next lift up the same; which at first they would not grant, till throwing them another</HI> Ropia, <HI>and seeming really to believe the Miracle, one of them gave me his Place, they judging amongst them∣selves that ten of them would be enough, though I took no pains, to lift it up so nimbly that I should not perceive them; but they were exceedingly deceiv'd: for the Stone, which I lifted not but with the end of my Finger, stirr'd not, till they pushing the same on me, I was forc'd to put my Thumb to it also; in which manner we lifted the Stone, though with great trouble, from the Ground; yet when I saw they all look'd angrily upon me, and be∣ing a Stranger, fear'd they might have ston'd me, I readily cry'd out with the rest,</HI> Coramet, <HI>and gave them another</HI> Ropia.</P>
<P>A considerable distance from <HI>Baramoulay</HI> is a great Lake, through the midst of which runs a Ri∣ver to <HI>Baramoulay:</HI> It is full of Fish, especially Eels, and swarms with Geese, wild Ducks, and other Water-fowl, which draws the Governor of <HI>Cachemire</HI> thither to spend the Winter.</P>
<P>In the midst of this Lake is a Cell, with a little Garden about it, which is said to drive after a strange manner upon the Water.</P>
<P>In this Place a Recluse spends his Life without ever coming from thence.</P>
<P>They relate divers Stories concerning this Her∣mitage, but by most it is generally believ'd, that an ancient King of <HI>Cachemire,</HI> out of curiosity built the same on great pieces of conjoyn'd Timber.</P>
<P>About this Lake is also a remarkable Spring, which boyling leisurely, rises very slowly with little Bubbles, and also casts up a certain fine Sand, which returns back to the bottom after the same manner as it came up: In a moment after the Water becomes still, without boyling or casting up the Sand, and then begins a fresh as before, yet without observing exact times between. It is said that this Wonder proceeds from a Man's speaking or standing near the same, especially if he stamp with his Foot against the Ground.</P>
<P>In the Mountains is a great Lake, which is full of Ice in Summer, and resembles a little Icy Sea; for the Winds breaking the Ice asunder, moves the same up and down.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stone <HI>Sengsafed.</HI></NOTE>Next you come to a Place call'd <HI>Sengsafed,</HI> which signifies <HI>A White Stone,</HI> which is very emi∣nent, because it is overgrown with several sorts of Flowers all the Summer; and at all times, when many People travelling that way make a great noise, there instantly falls a great Shower of Rain. But whether this be true or no, may be a little question'd; for when <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> went over the same some years since, he thought he should have dy'd there by reason of an excessive and unusual Shower of Rain, notwithstanding he had given strict order to make as little noise as was possible.</P>
<P>The same happens often on the Mountain <HI>Pire Penjale.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chara∣cter of the <HI>Cachemirans.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Cachemirans</HI> are accounted a beautiful People, and have as handsom Bodies as the <HI>Europe∣ans,</HI> having no resemblance at all with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> onely they have little Eyes like those of <HI>Cachever</HI> and great <HI>Tibet,</HI> their Neighbors. The Women are very slender and streight Bodied, which makes most of the Strangers that come to the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court covet them for Wives, to have Children by them that may be whiter than the <HI>Indians,</HI> and so pass for right <HI>Mogollans.</HI> Women of any Qua∣lity come seldom into the Streets; but the meaner sort scruple it not.</P>
<P>These People are very crafty, and more subtil and ingenious than the <HI>Indians,</HI> and no less addict∣ed to Poesie and other Sciences than the <HI>Persians.</HI> Moreover, they are very Lahorious, and quick of apprehension; and are good Artists in making Sedans, Bedsteads, Cupboards, Desks, and other neat Works. They varnish their Wood-work very curiously, and imitate the Veins of a certain Wood on any thing what they please, by Inlay∣ing it with Gold Wyres.</P>
<P>But that which is remarkable and peculiar to these People, and that which brings a Trade and Money into their Countrey, is the great num∣ber of Sashes or <HI>Chales,</HI> which they make, and al∣so teach their Children the Art of making them. These <HI>Chales</HI> are certain pieces of Stuffs about an Ell long, and three quarters broad, Embroider'd at both ends.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogols</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> both Men and Women, wear them on their Heads, or throw them over their Shoulders like a Cloak: They make them of two several sorts of Stuffs, namely Inland Wooll, which is much softer than the <HI>Spanish,</HI> and another sort of Wooll, or rather Hair call'd <HI>Touz,</HI> which grows on the Breasts of wild Goats which
<PB N="203" REF="149"/>breed in <HI>Tibet.</HI> These last are much dearer than the first, the Hair of Beaver not exceeding it in softness; but it is very subject: to Moths and Worms, if not beaten and air'd. They are much worn by the great <HI>Omrahs,</HI> who give for some of them a hundred, nay, a hundred and fifty <HI>Ropias,</HI> (each <HI>Ropia</HI> being 2 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI>) whenas those made of Inland Wooll cost not above fifty.</P>
<P>It is said that the King of <HI>Caximir</HI> Govern'd formerly over all the Mountains which extend to <HI>Tartary,</HI> and over all <HI>Indostan,</HI> quite to the Island of <HI>Ceilon.</HI></P>
<P>The Histories of this Countrey make mention, that the Dominions of the <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Gamon, Cachguer,</HI> and <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> were anciently under the Jurisdi∣ction of this Kingdom; the Inhabitants whereof were all Heathens, till about three hundred years ago that the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion was instituted, so that the greatest part are now <HI>Saracens.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caximir</HI> con∣quer'd by the <HI>Mogol.</HI></NOTE>To prevent all Invasions, the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> keeps four thousand Soldiers in <HI>Caximir,</HI> which was for∣merly a Kingdom by it self, and was Govern'd by an absolute King, who pay'd Tribute to none, till <HI>Anno</HI> 1665. that <HI>Ecbar</HI> conquer'd the Countrey at a time when the Inhabitants were at Difference, and maintain'd War one against another; for other∣wise he could never have master'd it, because <HI>Caximir</HI> is the most powerful of all the neighbor∣ing Kingdoms.</P>
<P>At present <HI>Caximir</HI> is Govern'd by a Vice-Roy of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s. The present Governor is call'd <HI>Diaretcan,</HI> sent thither by <HI>Oranchzef.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Great Mogol Ecbar</HI> took this Countrey by force from the last King <HI>Justef Chan</HI> after the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Ecbar</HI> was about to conquer the King∣dom of <HI>Maurenahar,</HI> and the King of <HI>Caximir</HI> lying between was preparing to prevent him, he sent <HI>Alli Myrza,</HI> to tell him, that he should immediately come to <HI>Lahor,</HI> and bring his Son with him, where he should be well Entertain'd, and receiv'd with as much, kindness as could be expected from a neighboring Prince and Friend, who would leave him in quiet possession of his Countrey, and assure him of his Fidelity, but if he resolv'd to hazard his Fortunes on an uncertain War, he would not one∣ly drive him out of his Realm, but also make him his Slave, and banish his Son. The King of <HI>Caxi∣mir</HI> affrighted with these Threatnings, surrendred himself immediately to <HI>Ecbar.</HI> But <HI>Jacob Chan</HI> his Son, who was not able to brook this Oppression, fled, and was immediately followed by so many Friends, that he had Strength sufficient to drive the <HI>Indians</HI> out of his Fathers Kingdom, and caus'd himself to be proclaim'd King; yet he enjoy'd the benefit belonging to that Title not long; for <HI>Ec∣bar</HI> being exceedingly enrag'd at his rebelling, sent <HI>Ally Myrza</HI> and <HI>Cassem Chan</HI> with thirty thou∣sand Men against him, with Command to give him Battel: But the young Prince not daring to En∣gage with such unequal Forces, fled into the high Mountains of <HI>Bunkery;</HI> whither <HI>Cassem Chan</HI> pur∣suing him by the guidance of some of the Natives, made himself Master of all the Mountains, and forc'd <HI>Jacob Chan</HI> to flie to <HI>Serenaguer,</HI> where in a short time after he was Besieged; and though the Place was very strong, and he had Men enough, he was forc'd to surrender himself, and being bound Hand and Foot, was carry'd to <HI>Indostan.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and Limits.</NOTE>THe Kingdom or Province of <HI>Dely,</HI> or <HI>Delly,</HI> is by <HI>Terry</HI> call'd <HI>Dellee,</HI> and by others <HI>Dely,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Heart,</HI> because it lies in the heart of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Dominions, and (as <HI>Terry</HI> saith) between <HI>Jenba</HI> and <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maginus</HI> places this Kingdom between those of <HI>Decan, Narsinga, Orixa,</HI> and <HI>Cambaya,</HI> and extend∣ing about the Province of <HI>Narsinga,</HI> is separated from the Kingdom of <HI>Cambaya</HI> by great Moun∣tains. The River <HI>Jeming</HI> running along one side thereof, serves for a Moat, over which a Bridge with ten Arches leads into the City.</P>
<P>The ancient Metropolis being also call'd <HI>Dely,</HI> was once a fair and large City, and the Seat and Burying-place of the <HI>Mogol</HI> Emperors, who after∣wards remov'd from thence to the new-built <HI>Dely.</HI> Its Glory consisted in many Tombs, in which above twenty great Kings and Lords lie buried. The superstitious <HI>Indians</HI> flock thither in Pilgrimage. It hath plenty of all things, and was anciently the Seat of King <HI>Porus,</HI> who near this Place was conquer'd by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> when he came to Invade him, with Elephants and a∣bundance of Horses.</P>
<P>Three Leagues from the City, on a place call'd <HI>Old Dely</HI> (where King <HI>Homayon,</HI> Father to <HI>Ecbar;</HI> lies buried) stands a great Marble Pillar or Pyra∣mid, which having a <HI>Greek</HI> Inscription, is the grea∣test Remark in all the Province, notwithstanding the Letters are almost worn out with age.</P>
<P>About fifty years ago <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> Father to the present <HI>Great Mogol Oranchzef,</HI> causing a City to be built not far from <HI>Old Dely,</HI> call'd it <HI>Schach Jehan Abad,</HI> that is, <HI>The Peopling of Schach Jeham,</HI> and made the same the Metropolis of the Realm in stead of <HI>Agra,</HI> where he said the Heat was too great in Summer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jehan Abad</HI> 2 new City, how seated.</NOTE>By reason of the nearness of the two foremen∣tion'd Places, the Ruins of the old City hath serv'd for the new one, and there is at present scarce any mention made of <HI>Dely;</HI> but altogether of <HI>Jehan Abad,</HI> which is a new City, lying in a barren
<PB N="204" REF="150"/>Field on the Banks of the River <HI>Jemna,</HI> and built onely along one side of the Stream, there being but one Bridge over the same, which is laid cross se∣veral Hulks: It is quite unwall'd on that side which respects the Water: The Walls are of Stone, yet not very tenible or defensive, there be∣ing no Moats nor any Breastworks, but round Tow∣ers after the old fashion, about a hundred Paces di∣stant from one another, and behind them a Mud Wall about four or five Foot thick: The circum∣ference of the Wall, with the Castle which is in∣clos'd in the same, is about two Leagues and a half; but if you include a long Suburb which runs to <HI>Lahor,</HI> and being a Rellick of the old <HI>Dely,</HI> is inhabited, it will make above a League in a di∣rect Line, and a Circumference which cannot justly be limited, because between this Suburb and the City are spacious Gardens and Fields, without any Buildings. The Castle, within which is the <HI>Ma∣halle</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI> besides other Royal Apartments, is built round, orather in a Semi-circle, and looks upon the River; between which and the Walls is a large sandy Plain, where they generally let the Elephants fight, and often Muster the <HI>Rajas</HI> or, principal <HI>Omrahs</HI> Soldiers in the King's Presence, who beholds the same out of his Hall Windows. The Walls of the Castle in respect of the round Towers, built after the old fashion, are almost like those of the City, but rais'd with Bricks and red Stones, which appearing like Marble, makes them much more beautiful than those of the City, than which they are also much higher, stronger, thicker, and more substantial against small Field-pieces. Besides, it is surrounded, except on the Water side, with a Moat of good Water, abounding with Fish, rais'd on both sides with Free-stone; yet nevertheless a Battery planted with great Guns may easily beat it down. Round about the Moat lies a large Garden, which in all Seasons is full of green Trees and Flowers, which with the red Walls make a pleasant Prospect. Round about this Garden runs the great Street, or rather a great Royal Court or Plain, on which open two of the greatest and chiefest Gates of the Castle, leading into the most eminent Streets of the City.</P>
<P>On the foremention'd Plain also stand the Tents of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> who being in the King's Service, watch every week by turns, whilst the <HI>Omrahs</HI> do the same Duty in the Castle, the <HI>Rajas</HI> delighting more to be in the Field, than lock'd up in the Fortress.</P>
<P>On the said Plain they also breathe the King's Horses every Morning; it serves also for a <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market-place, where all sorts of Merchandise are sold, and is the Meeting-place of several Phi∣losophers and Astronomers, as well <HI>Mahumetans</HI> as <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Here also the great <HI>Cobatcan,</HI> or Commissary of the Horse, takes a special Account of all the Troopers Horses that enter into the King's Ser∣vice, <HI>viz.</HI> if he finds the Horses to be <HI>Turkish,</HI> that is from <HI>Turkestan,</HI> or from <HI>Tartary,</HI> and big and able to do Service, then he marks them with a hot Iron on the Buttock with the King's Mark, and also the <HI>Omrahs</HI> under whom they Serve; and this is no ill Invention, to prevent the Troopers from lending their Horses one to another.</P>
<P>The foremention'd eminent Streets, which end over against the two Gates of the Castle, and on the Plain, are about twenty five or thirty Paces broad, and extend in a direct Line as far as the Eye can discern, though that which comes out a∣gainst the Gate of <HI>Lahor</HI> is much longer than the other, but all the Buildings are like one another. There are Arches on both sides of the Streets, flat on the top, without any Rooms over the same; neither are the Walks underneath intire, but the Arches are separated by Walls, the space be∣tween which serves several Handicrafts and Ar∣tists for Shops to work in in the day-time, and for Exchangers of Money to do their Business in, and Merchants to dispose their Commodities to Sale, which at Night they lock up in Warehouses. The Arches over these Warehouses are built un∣der the Merchants Houses; which appear very fair at a distance, and are very convenient, for standing very high, they are not onely out of the Dust, but stand very cool, and being in a manner even with the flat Roof of the Arches, they walking on them, may look into the Street, and sleep on the same for coolness in the Night. But besides these two eminent Streets there are five others, which are not so direct nor streight, but very like them in all things else. Many other Streets indeed there are which run from all parts of the City, and have most of them Arches, but because they are built for Dwelling-houses for private People, who are not curious in the uniformity of their Buildings, they are neither so streight nor so broad, nor so firmly built as the rest. In all the Streets stand the Houses of the <HI>Mansebdans</HI> or petty <HI>Omrahs,</HI> Persons of Judicature, Merchants and others, which are not meanly built. It is certain there are many which are built of Brick or other Stones, and divers of Clay, and cover'd with Straw, yet they are nevertheless very convenient, having Gardens and Orchards belonging to them; they are also very handsom within, for besides the good Furniture, the Straw Roofs are supported by long, hard, and strong Canes, and the Walls Plaister'd and Whitened.</P>
<P>Amongst these indifferent fair Houses, there are abundance of lesser, which being built of Lome, serve for Habitations for the Troopers, and other meaner People belonging to the <HI>Bazar</HI> and the King's Court.</P>
<P>By reason of these slight Houses <HI>Dely</HI> is very subject to Fire. <HI>Anno</HI> 1663. there were above sixty thousand Thatch'd Roofs consum'd by the Flame, which was the greater, as being aug∣mented by the strong Winds that blow in the Summer, which made it so fierce, that it destroy'd many Camels and Horses, there being no time to save them, and also many of the King's Concu∣bines, which having never been out of the <HI>Sera∣glio,</HI> were so bashful, that they chose rather to be burnt than be sav'd by strange Men.</P>
<P>By reason of these slight Houses of Lome, <HI>Dely</HI> cannot be said to be any thing else than a com∣pany of Villages joyn'd together, or rather a Camp with Tents, onely erected in a better order, and more convenient than usuall in the Fields.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Houses of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> they stand also in most parts of the City, especi∣ally along the Rivers, and in the Suburbs.</P>
<P>If a House in these warm Countreys bears the Name of Handsom and Large, it is infallibly very convenient, <HI>viz.</HI> it is seated in a place where the Wind can come to it from all Corners, especially the Northern: it hath Gardens, Orchards, Fish∣ponds, and Springs, large Vaults or Cellars, with great light Holes to let the Wind in at. The Inhabitants retiring into them in the heat of the day, stay in them till about four or five a clock;
<PB N="205" REF="150"/>or else they have <HI>Cascanays,</HI> which are little Hou∣ses of Straw, or sweet-smelling Roots, being very curiously made, and commonly plac'd in the mid∣dle of a Park, near a Pond or Spring, that the Ser∣vants may with their Leather Jacks wet them on the out side.</P>
<P>The eminent Houses stand in the midst of a large Square, and have not sloaping but flat Roofs, on which they may sleep in the Night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Furni∣ture of the Houses.</NOTE>As to what concerns the inside of the principal Houses, the Floors are cover'd with Cotton Quilts of four Fingers thick, with a white Linnen Cloth laid over them in the Summer, and with Carpets in the Winter. In the chief Chambers near the Wall must also lie two or three Quilts cover'd with Silk, and embroider'd with Gold and Silver, for the Master of the House to sit on, or for Per∣sons of Quality that come to visit him: moreo∣ver, on every Quilt lies a Cushion of Cloth of Gold; round about the Chamber against the Walls, stand also many of these great Cushions of Flannel or flower'd Sattin to sit on. In the Walls, about four or five Foot from the Floor, they make several Windows of different fashions, even one with another, and adorn'd with Flower-pots and <HI>Porcelane</HI> Dishes; but they have no Images of Men or Beasts, because their Religion permits it not.</P>
<P>Most of the foremention'd Houses in <HI>Dely</HI> are fur∣nish'd after one and the same manner, though more or less rich according to the Quality of the Own∣ers, by which means <HI>Dely</HI> is not without many fair Buildings, yet far inferior to our <HI>European.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding <HI>Dely</HI> is the Seat and Court of a mighty Prince, and the Staple for many Mer∣chandises, yet it is not to be compar'd to <HI>London, Paris,</HI> or <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the richest and most valua∣ble Commodities being oftner found in Ware∣houses than Shops, for where there is one Shop furnish'd with fine Cloths, Silk-Stuffs mixt with Gold and Silver, <HI>Turbants</HI> embroider'd with Gold, Cloth of Tissue, and other rich Commodi∣ties, there are above twenty which fell nothing but Butter, Rice, Barley, Pease, Wheat, and other Corn, the common Food not onely of the Heathens, who never eat Flesh, but also of the vulgar <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and Soldidrs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dely</HI> stor'd with divers sorts of Fruit from other Parts.</NOTE>In this City is a most excellent Fruit-Market, and many Confectioners Shops, who ih the Sum∣mer sell all sorts of dry'd Fruit, brought thither from <HI>Persia, Balk, Bocara,</HI> and <HI>Samarcand,</HI> as Al∣monds, Pistachoes, Nuts, Raisins; Plumbs, Apri∣cocks, and others. In the Winter there are ex∣cellent Grapes, brown and white, which being wrapt up in Cotton, are also brought from the foremention'd Countreys, as likewise Apples, two or three sorts of Pears, and rare Melons, which lasting the whole Winter, are sold very dear.</P>
<P>There are no Fruits growing in this Countrey but Melons, which being not very good, are sold at a small rate. Persons of Quality who take care to have the Seed brought from <HI>Persia,</HI> and Till or Manure their Ground well, may have excellent good Melons, yet they are very scarce, the Earth being so barren, that after the first year they dege∣nerate.</P>
<P>There is another sort of Fruit call'd <HI>Amba</HI> or <HI>Mangas,</HI> which for two Moneths in Summer are very plentiful and cheap.</P>
<P>There are likewise all the year round <HI>Patecues,</HI> or Water-Melons.</P>
<P>Their Preserves are very ill made, being full of Dirt and Flyes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The several sorts of Pro∣vision in <HI>Dely.</HI></NOTE>Every Street affords Shops full of Bread, which by reason there are but sew Ovens, is not well prepar'd; yet in the Castle is much delicate Bread sold; and the <HI>Omrahs</HI> also make good Bread in their Houses, not sparing Milk, Eggs, and But∣ter to put into it, yet it commonly tastes mealy and burnt.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bazars</HI> are several Cook Shops where Meat is dress'd, but after a sluttish manner; be∣sides, their Meat is very unwholsom, for they commonly roast or boyl a piece of a Horse or Ca∣mel, or of an Ox that dy'd in a Ditch; so that all Persons who will eat good Meat, must dress it in their own Houses.</P>
<P>In most parts of the City are Shambles, where Flesh is expos'd to Sale; but the Buyers must take special care that they buy not Mutton in stead of Goats-flesh, because both their Beef and Mutton is very feaverish, windy, and bad to digest, though well enough tasted.</P>
<P>The best Victuals in this Countrey is a raw Buck, which is not sold in Joynts by Butchers, but alive, so that if any Person hath a mind to it, he must buy a whole Buck, which is very inconveni∣ent, because the Flesh, though kill'd in the Morn∣ing, will be tainted before Night.</P>
<P>They have no Capons in this Countrey, the Inhabitants whereof are more compassionate to Beasts than Men, whom they bereave of their Genitals to serve them in the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> but in the Market are abundance of Hens, which are cheap and good; and amongst others there are a sort of little Hens with black Feathers, which are very dainty, and therefore dear.</P>
<P>There are also Pigeons to be sold, but no young ones, because they account it criminal to kill them.</P>
<P>There are also Pheasants, but much smaller than ours, which are taken in Nets, and brought alive to the Market, as they do Ducks and other Fowl.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Fish, there are few which love it, notwithstanding there are some very good, especiall two sorts; the one is call'd <HI>Hinghala,</HI> and the other, resembling our Carps, is call'd <HI>Rau.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descrip∣tion of the Castle.</NOTE>The Castle, of which we have before made mention, comprehends the <HI>Seraglio</HI> and other Royal Structures; but they resemble not the <HI>Eu∣ropean,</HI> nor need they be like them for it is suffici∣ent that they have the splendor and strength which this Climate requites. There is nothing remark∣able at the Entrance, except two great Elephants of Stone, which stand on each side of the Gate; on the one sits the Image of <HI>Jemel,</HI> the famous <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Chitor;</HI> on the other, that of <HI>Polta</HI> his Bro∣ther.</P>
<P>These are the two Heroes, who with their Mo∣ther, more valiant than they, vex'd the <HI>Great Mo∣gol Ecbar,</HI> and shew'd excellent proofs of their Valour in the Towns which he Besieg'd, resolving rather to die with their Mother, than become sub∣ject to the <HI>Mogol.</HI> By reason of this unheard of Valour, their Enemies themselves have thought them worthy to have the two foremetion'd Sta∣tues erected in honor of them.</P>
<P>Having pass'd through the Gate of the Castle, you come to a long broad Street, which is divided into two by a Brook of running Watet, and hath on each side a long <HI>Divan</HI> of five or six Foot high, and four broad, with several Arches like Gates.</P>
<P>On this long <HI>Divan</HI> Scriveners, Registers, and
<PB N="206" REF="151"/>others have their several Offices out of the Press and Crowd of the People which pass by them along the Street, which lies lower than their Shops, on which also the <HI>Mansebdars</HI> or petty <HI>Omrahs</HI> keep Guard in the Night.</P>
<P>There is a Brook running through the midst of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which fills other Moats with its Wa∣ter, and hath its original out of a River three or four Leagues from <HI>Dely,</HI> whence it is convey'd in a Channel cross the Plains, and between many Rocks, which have been open'd with great difficulty and hard Labor.</P>
<P>Coming through the other Gate of the Castle, there opens another large and broad Street, which also hath its <HI>Divans</HI> on each side with Shops. This Street being properly a <HI>Bazar,</HI> is very com∣modious during the Rainy and Summer Season, because it is covere'd with a long and broad Arch, which on the top hath a fair <HI>Cupula,</HI> through which it receives Light.</P>
<P>Besides these two Streets are several other lesser on the right and left side, which lead to the Lodg∣ings where the <HI>Omrahs</HI> watch twenty four hours once a Week by turns. These Lodgings are very stately, the <HI>Omrahs</HI> beautifying them at their own Costs and Charge, and are commonly the great <HI>Divans,</HI> which are opposite to a Square, interlac'd with several Brooks of Water and Springs. Du∣ring the time that they are on the Guard, the King sends them all their Victuals ready dress'd, which they receive with great Ceremony and Reve∣rence, repeating three several times the <HI>Taslin</HI> or Thanks, and laying their Hands upon their Heads, turn their Faces towards the King's Lodgings.</P>
<P>There are yet many more <HI>Divans</HI> and Tents erected in several places, which are the Apart∣ments of divers Officers.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are a great number of <HI>Carca∣nays,</HI> which are Shops wherein Handicraftsmen follow several Employments, as Embroiderers, Goldsmiths, Painters, Taylors, Shoemakers, and Silkweavers, each in a peculiar Shop.</P>
<P>All these Tradesmen come every Morning to work in this <HI>Carcanays,</HI> and staying there all day, return home to their Houses in the Evening, each Man living very peaceably and quiet, none aiming to be higher than their Condition hath allotted them; for a Taylor breeds his Son a Taylor, and so the rest, and no Person converses with any Man but those of his own Trade; which Custom is punctually observ'd, not onely by the <HI>Heathens,</HI> who are oblig'd thereto by their Laws, but also amongst the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> which is the occasion of many beautiful Virgins living unmarried, when as they might Match to the raising their Fortunes, if their Parents would permit them to Marry a Man of another Trade or Quality which they account meaner than theirs.</P>
<P>After having pass'd all these Places before mention'd, you come to the <HI>Amacas,</HI> which is a large Square with <HI>Piazzaes,</HI> which have no Houses over them, but are divided by a Wall with a lit∣tle Door or Gate, through which you walk out of one part into another.</P>
<P>Beyond the great Gate, which is in the midst of one of the sides of this Square, you come to a large <HI>Divan,</HI> which is all open towards the side of the Court, and is call'd <HI>Nagar-canay,</HI> because it is the place where the Trumpetters, or rather Cymbal-players are, who in their Turns play both day and night. But this seems at first a strange sound in the Ears of Strangers who are not us'd to it, there being sometimes ten or twelve of these Trumpetters, and as many Cimbal-players, who play all together.</P>
<P>They have Trumpets which they call <HI>Carna,</HI> a Cubit and a half long, with an opening at the bottom of a Foot diameter. So likewise there are Cymbals of Copper or Iron, half a Yard wide, from whence one may judge of the noise which they make; their sound is so harsh in the Ears of Strangers, and so loud, that they cannot endure to hear the same; yet custom makes it pleasant, espe∣cially in the Night, when it is heard at a distance on the tops of Houses; wherefore those that are appointed to play, are plac'd on high at a distance from the King's Lodgings.</P>
<P>Opposite to the great Gate of the Court, over which this <HI>Nagar-canay</HI> is kept, is a spacious Hall, built on several high Columns, and open on three sides, all which look towards the Court. The Pil∣lars and Floor of this Hall are gilded and painted. In the midst of the Wall, which separates this Hall from the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> is a very high and broad Window, where the King sits on his Throne, with some of his Sons by his side, and some Eunuchs standing near him, who either keep the Flyes from him with the Tails of Peacocks, or cool him with great Fans, whilst others in other postures wait to receive his Commands: Below him stand all the <HI>Omrahs, Rajas,</HI> and Ambassadors, with cast-down Eyes, and their Hands on their Breasts: Below these stand the <HI>Mansebdars,</HI> or inferior <HI>Omrahs,</HI> in the same humble postures, whilst the remaining part of the Hall or Court is fill'd with divers sorts of other People. In this place the King gives Au∣dience to all Persons every day about Noon; for which reason this great Hall is call'd <HI>Amcas,</HI> that is, <HI>The Place of Audience.</HI></P>
<P>During the foremention'd Assembly, the King, to recreate himself, causes a certain number of his best Horses to be led by before him, that so he may see whether they are well kept, which he al∣so doth by his best Elephants, which are wash'd and colour'd black all over, except two broad red Stroaks, which running from their Heads cross their Backs, unite near the Tail. The Elephants at that time also are richly caparison'd with Em∣broider'd Cloths and two Silver Bells, which hang on each side by a thick Silver Chain, which lies cross their Backs, and have large and curious Cow Tails, brought from <HI>Tibet,</HI> hanging about their Necks. Moreover, two lesser Elephants are led by their sides, as if their Slaves, and appointed to serve the bigger. These mighty great Beasts, as if proud of being set forth in such a manner, walk very stately, and coming before the King, the Riders of them sitting on their Shoulders, prick them into the Skin with an Iron Hook, and speak∣ing to them, make them bow their Knees, throw their Noses up in the Air, and make a certain kind of noise, which the People look upon to be a <HI>Taslin</HI> or Salute. After the Elephants they bring out several sorts of Beasts, as the <HI>Nilgaux,</HI> or grey Oxen, a sort of <HI>Elands,</HI> Rhinocerots, and great Buffaloes from <HI>Bengala,</HI> to fight with their great Horns against a Lion or Tyger, tame Leopards or Panthers, with which the King goes a Hunting. This done, they lead by the King's Greyhounds sent him from <HI>Usbeck.</HI> Lastly, divers Birds of prey, amongst which some are taught to seize on a Hare.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> tells us, That the City <HI>Amadabath</HI> is very ancient, by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call'd <HI>Amastis,</HI> and by <HI>Arrianus, Amadavastis,</HI> and that King <HI>Hamed</HI> onely enlarg'd the same <HI>Anno</HI> 375. after <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s flight from <HI>Mecha.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amadabath</HI> is one of the four Cities where the <HI>Mogol</HI> as a peculiar Favor keeps his Court. It lies in the middle of the Countrey in a delightful Plain, on the Bank of a small River call'd <HI>Saker Mati,</HI> a Branch of the <HI>Indus,</HI> in 33 Degrees and 10 Minutes Northern Latitude, or (according to <HI>Herbert</HI>) in 23 Degrees and 18 Minutes; but ac∣cording to <HI>Mandeslo,</HI> in 24 Degrees and 109 Mi∣nutes Longitude, eighteen Leagues from <HI>Cambaya,</HI> sixty two, or as some say, forty five Leagues from <HI>Zurratte,</HI> and sixteen from the Sea. It is surrounded with a Wall of Free-stone about six Miles in cir∣cumserence, forty Foot high and fifteen thick, and fortifi'd with many round Turrets: About the Wall runs a Moat about six Paces broad, though quite decay'd, and in many places dry. The Streets are streight and broad, yet lie unpav'd, and very troublesom to walk in, by reason of the Dust, which by means of the continual Drought is very great. The chiefest Streets are planted on both sides with <HI>Coco, Terri, Orange,</HI> and <HI>Tamarind</HI>-trees. The Houses, which are for the most part built of Sun-dry'd Brick, are pretty large, but very low and flat after the Eastern manner. There are like∣wise several <HI>Bazars</HI> or Exchanges, the biggest and most eminent whereof is call'd <HI>Bazari Colam,</HI> that is, <HI>The great Bazar</HI> or <HI>Exchange:</HI> It is a broad, streight, and long Street, full of Shops on both sides; in the midst thereof stands a Stone Structure cross the Street, like a Bridge on three Arches, in a triangular manner. Beyond this Edi∣fice is also in the midst of the Street, a great Well, inclos'd within a square Earthen Bank; the Wa∣ter in it is very useful to the Inhabitants, who flock thither in great numbers to fetch the same. Near the end of this Street stands a great Portal, with its Front towards the Street between two Towers, and is the Gate of a small Burrough, in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Cut.</HI> Near this Burrough at the end of the Street <HI>Maidan,</HI> are two Galleries, one on each side, rais'd a little from the Ground, where the King's Edicts or Proclamations are ge∣nerally read. going from hence through a great Gate on the right hand, you behold, at a little di∣stance from thence on the left side, the Vice-Roy or Governor's Palace or Castle, which (as others say) lies in the midst of the City, on the Bank of the River, inclos'd within a Wall of Free-stone. This Castle, which is accounted the best and strongest Fortress, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath in all <HI>India,</HI> except that of <HI>Cabul</HI> and <HI>Candahar,</HI> is commonly fortifi'd with eighteen great Guns, be∣sides many lesser, and hath a large square inward Court, in the middle whereof stands a high Pole, on which placing an Arrow, they shoot at it with a Bowe. The King's Lodgings, which are on the left side, at the entrance into this Square, are very low, and none of the most beautiful. Under the Windows of these Lodgings appear several Offi∣cers call'd <HI>Mansebdars,</HI> which Command each a thousand Horse; and within the Rails under the Penthouse stand two artificial Elephants, colour'd according to the Life. Opposite to the King's Lodgings are many other such like Ornaments, ac∣cording to the custom of the Countrey. The Martial Officers, and those which serve in the next Places under the <HI>Mansebdars,</HI> as the <HI>Chans</HI> and others of like Quality, keep Guard on the King's Roofs or Balconies, or in some Rooms near them; those that are of a lower Degree, and Command onely over two or three Horses, walk up and down the Court without the Inclosures. On the other side of the foremention'd Lodgings, stands another Structure with an Inclosure oppo∣site thereto, but without any Ornamentals, where the King's Life-guards and other Officers keep Guard. Out of this Court passing through a Gate, you come into another Court, which being sur∣rounded with Lodging-Rooms and Kitchins, is not so neat and clean as the other. There are like∣wise several <HI>Caravanseraes,</HI> and amongst others one call'd <HI>Terri Caravansera,</HI> or <HI>The Taylors Cara∣vansera.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> also have thirty great <HI>Metzids</HI> or Temples in this City, besides a great many little <HI>Pagodes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Benjans</HI> likewise possess twelve eminent Places in the City, besides other lesser in the Sub∣urbs, where they meet to perform their religious Offices.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> have also four Churches, the <HI>Ar∣menians</HI> and <HI>Abyssines</HI> each of them one, and the <HI>Jews</HI> a Synagogue.</P>
<P>At the end of the great Street <HI>Bazari Colan</HI> stands a <HI>Pagode</HI> built in honor of <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> to which a great number of People resort daily: moreover, the Street which leads thither is always full of People, not onely those that go thither to their Devotion, and those that return from thence, but also abundance of poor People, who stand∣ing on both sides of the Street, beg Alms of those that pass by. The <HI>Pagode,</HI> which is an in∣different large Building, hath a long narrow En∣try almost under Ground, for it goes down with several Steps, which makes it seem to be rather a Way leading into a Cave, than a <HI>Pagode.</HI> By rea∣son of the abundance of People that flock thither, and the narrowness of the Way, there is always a great Crowd: At the Entrance hang several Bells, which the Pilgrims gingling at their going in, make a continual noise with them. In the <HI>Pa∣gode</HI> are several <HI>Gioghi</HI> or Priests, which go stark naked, having onely a Cloth about their Privities;
<PB N="210" REF="153"/>they wear long Hair, which they seldom or never Combe; they colour their Foreheads with Saf∣fron, and strew Sand upon them, but keep the other parts of their Body very clean; yet some of them painting themselves with several Colours, sprinkle Ashes over the Painting.</P>

In some of the Chambers are three such Images; the middlemost whereof being large, is of white Marble, and they other two lesser of black.</P>
<P>In the middle of the foremention'd Court stands a <HI>Pagode,</HI> on each side of whose Entrance are plac'd two great Elephants of black Marble; on one of them sits the Image of the Founder of this Stru∣cture, the Roof whereof, as also of some of the other Buildings, are round like a Vault. The Walls at the Entrance are painted with several Images of Men and Beasts. Within you see no∣thing but three obscure Angles at the further end, in every one of which stand three of the foremen∣tion'd Images, and before the middlemost of them a burning Lamp. A <HI>Brahman</HI> or Priest commonly performs their religious Service after the follow∣ing manner: First he adorns the Images with Flowers and Garlands, which those that come thi∣ther to their Devotion bring along with them for an Offering. No Man or Woman is permitted to approach this holy Place, unless barefoot, and they are to make their Offerings kneeling before the Rail which incloses the Images. The Offerings consist in all manner of sweet-smelling Flowers. Oyl to burn in the Lamps, and Rice and Salt, which they strew on some little Bells that hang amongst several Lamps before the Rail; whilst the Priest lays the foremention'd Trifles before the Images, with a great Cloth over his Mouth, that no unclean thing may come from his Breath upon the Image, he mutters many things before it to himself, and sometimes going to the Lamps, holds his Hands a considerable time over the Flame, and rubs them as if he wash'd them with Water, and sometimes rubs them over his Face, which they affirm serves to purifie them, because they say that the Fire cleanses all things.</P>
<P>Both within and without the City are many pleasant Gardens and Banquetting-houses, and in the midst of them Ponds and Wells of clear and sweet Water, in which the Inhabitants Bathe themselves in hot Weather.</P>
<P>By reason of Gardens and Orchards in and about the City, it seems to Strangers to be rather a pleasant Grove than a City. It hath also very large and populous Suburbs, and amongst others one call'd <HI>Begamboer.</HI></P>
<P>Eastward from the City the <HI>Benjans</HI> have built an Hospital, wherein they cure all wounded Birds, Beasts, and other Animals.</P>
<P>There are twenty five eminent Villages under the Jurisdiction of <HI>Amadabath,</HI> and under them two thousand nine hundred ninety eight Hamlets, which pay Tribute to the great Villages.</P>
<P>On one side of the City runs a Way which is six Leagues long, call'd <HI>Bag-Schaban,</HI> to a great and pleasant Village, and being planted on both sides with standing Trees, hath many cross Ways, all which are as cool and shady as a Wood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A stately Tomb.</NOTE>Near the City is a Tomb erected by King <HI>Reer,</HI> in honor of a Tutor whom he lov'd exceedingly, in hopes to make immortal by this stately Structure, whose Walls and Floors are all of po∣lish'd Marble. There are three Gardens belong∣ing to the same, one of which is surrounded with four hundred Pillars of Porphyrie Stones of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> order. Near it is a large <HI>Tank</HI> or Pond of Water, inclos'd with a Stone Wall, in which are many Windows, which yield a pleasant Pro∣spect on the Water.</P>
<P>At <HI>Sesques,</HI> not above half an hours walking from thence, are the sepulchral Monuments of se∣veral Princes of <HI>Cambaya,</HI> erected in a Temple, which is much frequented by the superstitious <HI>Ben∣jans.</HI></P>
<P>A Mile from the City is the Garden and Pa∣lace of <HI>Chanchonna,</HI> Son to the great <HI>Byram, Chan</HI> of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey of <HI>Cambaya</HI> to <HI>Amadabat,</HI> is for the most part desolate and uncultivated. In the Way are several Pits, each above thirty Yards deep, in which is salt Water, though at a great distance from the Sea; it is drawn out by Oxen.</P>
<P>The Countrey about <HI>Amadabath</HI> is nothing but a vast Wilderness, and the Ways very dusty and troublesom for Travellers. The High-ways are Hedg'd in on both sides with a certain Fruitless and Leafless Plant, which shoots forth onely little long Stalks, of a deep Green, both Winter and Summer, out of which, when broke asunder, drops a milky Juice like that of green Figs, and being very sharp, eats into that part of the Skin on which it drops. The Fields which border the High∣ways, are full of <HI>Ambe</HI>-trees, which bear a Fruit like great Olives, and also af <HI>Tamarind</HI>-trees.</P>
<P>Without the City are many great Tombs of Marble, erected by the <HI>Moors,</HI> and are much state∣lier than their Houses.</P>
<P>A League and a half from the City lies a great Village call'd <HI>Zirkes,</HI> or <HI>Sirkesia,</HI> where there is a very magnificent Tomb, the whole Structure with its Floors being all of polish'd Marble, and distin∣guish'd into three parts; one whereof rests on a a hundred and forty Marble Pillars, each thirty Foot high, curiously adorn'd with Festunes and Pedestals, after the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order. This Stru∣cture is said to be the Tomb of one <HI>Cacis,</HI> Tutor to one of the Kings of <HI>Zurratte,</HI> to whom they ascribe great Sanctity and Wonders; and that the said King, who with three other Kings lies buried in another Chappel, built the same in commemora∣tion of his Tutor. At a certain time of the year, most of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> come hither in Pilgri∣mage, firmly believing thereby to obtain pardon for their sins. On one side of it is a large Pond.</P>
<P>About a Mile from the City is another fair Tomb, of an eminent <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Merchant call'd <HI>Hajom Majom,</HI> who being enamor'd of the Beauty of his Daughter, and threupon Ravishing her, was Beheaded by the King's Command, and bu∣ried here with all his Family; wherefore the Inhabitants to this day call the same <HI>Betychint,</HI> that is, <HI>The uncover'd shame of your Daughter.</HI></P>
<P>In the Suburb <HI>Begamboer,</HI> near a River, lies one of the King's Gardens call'd <HI>Schvchbag,</HI> which be∣ing very large, is surrounded with a strong Wall; at one end of it stands a pleasant Banquetting-house,

<P>The Water of the foremention'd River is con∣vey'd round the said Banquetting-house, not far from which you come into another Garden, over a high Stone Bridge four hundred Paces long; and though this Garden be but small, yet it is very pleasant and high, and hath also at the end against the Bridge a brave Banquetting-house. The Wa∣ter in the droughty Season is drawn up but of the Wells by Oxen, and put into two great Stone Ci∣sterns before the Banquetting-house. This Gar∣den, wherein commonly young Women Bathe themselves in the foremention'd Cisterns, is call'd <HI>Nicunabag,</HI> that is, <HI>The Garden of Precious Stones,</HI> and is said to have been made by a beautiful and rich Lady.</P>
<P>There is yet another delightful Garden with a Banquetting-house, which was built by the <HI>Great Mogol Ecbar,</HI> in commemoration of his conquering the last King of <HI>Zurratte,</HI> call'd <HI>Sultan Mahomed Begeran,</HI> in that very place; whereby the King∣dom of <HI>Zurratte</HI> became subject to the <HI>Great Mogol.</HI></P>
<P>Ten Leagues from <HI>Amadabath</HI> lies a little Town, full of pretty Houses, and <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples, call'd <HI>Niervant.</HI></P>
<P>Six Leagues from the said City also lies ano∣ther Town call'd <HI>Mamadabad,</HI> on the Bank of a pleasant River; on the North side of it is a fair Palace. The Inhabitants of this Town are for the most part Weavers.</P>

There are also many stately Palaces in this City, which for its defence hath a strong Castle near the River, built after the man∣ner of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and surrounded with Walls of Free-stone and deep Moats, which receive their Water out of the River <HI>Reinier:</HI> It is an ancient Structure, built by the Inhabitants long before the coming of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> into these Countreys, or (as some say) by the <HI>Romans.</HI> According to the Relation of the Inhabitants to <HI>Mandeslo,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> coming thither with many Ships out of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and conquering several Places, built this Fort, which hath but one Gate towards the side of a great Plain or Market, and is very strongly guard∣ed, none daring to come into the same, but those that are upon Duty, nor are any Persons Listed to serve in the same, but native <HI>Indostans,</HI> the <HI>Ras∣butes;</HI> though valiant Soldiers, often mutinying against the <HI>Mogol;</HI> the <HI>Benjans</HI> and <HI>Usbecks</HI> being accounted Enemies, and the <HI>Benjans</HI> and <HI>Cambayans</HI> never serving for Soldiers, accounting it a great sin to shed Blood. Next to the Castle is the <HI>Na∣bab,</HI> or <HI>Sultan</HI>'s House, and next to that the Cu∣stom-house and the Market, to which the Inhabi∣tants of the neighboring Villages and Strangers bring their Goods to sell.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Surratte</HI> is very populous, and inha∣bited partly by native <HI>Indians,</HI> and partly by Stran∣gers and Foreigners, for Trade.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> of these Parts consist generally of <HI>Zurrattans, Cambayans, Benjans, Brahmans, Decans,</HI> and some <HI>Rasbutes,</HI> who are all generally Idolaters or <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> the last mention'd are the smallest number, and the <HI>Benjans</HI> are the richest, driving the greatest Trade. All these People live very quiet one amongst another; for the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> though himself a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> makes no distinction amongst his People of several Religions, but gives them Offices alike, both at his Court and in his Army.</P>
<P>Amongst the Foreigners or Strangers, the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> drive the greatest Trade here, besides which there are <HI>Portugueses, Arabians, Per∣sians, Armenians, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> wherefore <HI>Suratte</HI> is accounted one of the most eminent Ci∣ties for Trade in all <HI>India,</HI> both in respect of its Haven, and because the convenience of carrying the Commodities through all <HI>Suratte</HI> from <HI>Cam∣baya</HI> and other Places, draws the Merchants thi∣ther. The <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders have many fair Houses in the City, very convenient to dwell in, and also to stow their Goods. The People of several Nations have each of them a Church here, and their own Teachers. Without the City the Inhabitants have many pleasant Gardens and Ban∣quetting-houses along the side of the River.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Re∣marks in <HI>Su∣ratte.</HI></NOTE>Amongst the Remarks which this City hath, the chiesest is a mighty Pond with divers Angles, rais'd with Free-stone in a manner like Steps, on which the People descend to the Water; in the middle of which lies an Isle that none can have access to but in a Boats, or by swimming. On one side of this Pond is a pretty long, broad, and deep Channel or Moat, over which lie several Bridges, that lead to another larger Pond, which here would be accounted a great Lake, though there it be look'd upon as a very small one. This also hath many Angles, and is wall'd about with Free∣stone, with which also the sides of the Moat are strengthned. Between the great and lesser Ponds near the Moat stands a Tomb of two eminent <HI>Ma∣humetans</HI> which kill'd one another. This Pond or Pool was in the beginning of this Age made by a rich Inhabitant of this City, with the expence of his whole Estate, insomuch that his Daughter be∣came miserably poor, none of the Townsmen once relieving her, though her Father had for their ac∣commodation and the publick good, exhausted all his Treasure. The Pool is call'd <HI>Gopi Telau,</HI> from the Builder, whose Name was <HI>Gopis.</HI></P>
<P>Without the City, towards the Sea side, is a every pleasant Garden, which formerly belong'd to the King of <HI>Suratte:</HI> It is but little, yet full of Trees, Plants and Herbs.</P>
<P>There is also a little <HI>Kiosk,</HI> or cover'd place, built at the end of the Garden over a large Pool, which is no less commodious to the Inhabitants than the Pool at <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from thence stands a <HI>Mosque,</HI> also built over a Pond; before the Gates thereof sit com∣monly many People on the Ground, begging Alms of those that pass by. Within the <HI>Mosque,</HI> near the Wall, in a narrow dark Corner, stands a little Marble Pyramid, call'd <HI>Pyr,</HI> that is, <HI>Old,</HI> which perhaps is the Burying-place of one whom
<PB N="212" REF="156"/>they worship as an ancient Saint. There is gene∣rally a great resort to this <HI>Mosque,</HI> not onely of <HI>Ma∣humetans,</HI> but also of <HI>Heathens</HI> or Idolaters, who give sufficient testimonies of their superstitious and ridiculous Worship. The Entrance is always crowded with People, especially Women; those that go into the <HI>Mosque</HI> strow Flowers and Rice for an Offering; to which purpose there stand many at the Door who sell the same. But the Idolaters are much more zealous herein than the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI></P>
<P>On the North side of the City is another great Pool, encompass'd with a Wall of Free-stone, ha∣ving eighteen Angles, each twenty five Yards broad, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Legend of</HI> Oman Hi∣dal Chan.</NOTE> with Stone Steps to descend. In the mid∣dle stands the Tomb of the Builder call'd <HI>Omar Hidal Chan,</HI> a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> who (as the Inhabitants relate) was a General in his Life-time; they also tell many strange Tales of him, <HI>viz.</HI> That he Encountred with the Devil and conquer'd him, but out of compassion releas'd him again: That he convey'd the Stones to this Building by Leo∣pards and Tygers: And that he threw the Moun∣tain <HI>Morna,</HI> lying not far from <HI>Derman,</HI> with his own Hands, from the ancient City <HI>Reinier.</HI> In this Pool they gather Rain-water, which in the dry Seasons (for it often happens, that not a drop of Rain falls there in a whole year) is wholsomer to be us'd than the Water out of the River <HI>Reinier,</HI> which is brackish with the ebbing and flowing of the Sea.</P>
<P>On the North side of the City stands an <HI>Indian</HI> Wonder-tree, under whose Boughs and Shadow may lie three or four thousand Men. Under the same Tree is a Chappel, in which a <HI>Benjan</HI> Saint call'd <HI>Gemsch</HI> lies buried: Before the Door stands an Image in a very horrid shape. Divers Lamps burn night and day in this Chappel, whither a great number of Idolaters repair to perform their Devotion.</P>
<P>About a League and a half Northward from the Mouth of the River <HI>Tapti</HI> or <HI>Reinier,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Haven or Harbor of <HI>Sohali.</HI></NOTE> and four, (or according to <HI>Mandeslo</HI> two) Leagues from the City of <HI>Suratte,</HI> is a Road or Harbor, by the In∣habitants call'd <HI>Sohali,</HI> or <HI>Swali,</HI> or <HI>Suhali,</HI> from the neighboring Village: It extends North-East and by East, and South-West and by West, under 21 Degrees and fifty Minutes, between the Main Continent and the Sand-banks, which are dry at low Water, or very shallow. It is defended from all Winds except the Southern, and a Mus∣quet-shot broad at the Mouth, where the Ships lade and unlade, and hath at high Water seven, and at low, five Fathom, with <HI>a</HI> hard and even Ground. The Goods are from thence carried by Land, which is very plain, in Carrs, or in Boats up the River to the City <HI>Suratte.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> have several Huts along the Shore, where they first unlade their Commodities, and af∣terwards put them into their Store-houses. It is impossible for any Ship to ride at an Anchor here from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>September,</HI> by reason of the great Storms and Tempests, mix'd with Thunder and Lightning; which to avoid, the Ships go to the Cape of <HI>Comori, Cormandel,</HI> and <HI>Bengala,</HI> till such time as the foremention'd blustering Season is over, and then they return again.</P>
<P>All the Countrey about <HI>Surratte</HI> is very plain, and the whole year round very green and pleasant. About the Village <HI>Sohali</HI> grow many <HI>Coco, Tama∣rind,</HI> and other Fruit-trees. Both within and without the City are many Gardens, full of all sorts of Fruits, as Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Peaches, and others.</P>
<P>Not far from the City lies a very fruitful Grove of tall <HI>Coco</HI>-nuts, Citrons, Oranges, <HI>Tama∣rinds,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Fruit-trees, and is not only able to furnish the City with Wood, but also the adjacent Towns, nay, they whole Province with Timber, for the building of Houses and Ship∣ping.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fertility of the Soil.</NOTE>The Soyl about the City is also very fertile, and yields abundance of Rice, Barley, Beans, and what else is requisite for humane subsistance.</P>
<P>There are also many excellent Pastures, and consequently abundance of Cattel, as Buffaloes, Oxen, Sheep, Goats, and all manner of Venison, as also many Asses, but few Camels and Horses.</P>
<P>This City, under whose Jurisdiction are above four hundred Villages, is Govern'd by a <HI>Sultan,</HI> who determines all Cases in <HI>Surratte</HI> and the ad∣jacent Villages, and receiving the Customs and Revenues, sends them to the <HI>Mogol.</HI> Besides him there is another Officer, appointed by the <HI>Mogol</HI> to Govern the Castle, with whom the Governor of the City hath nothing to do; they live both very magnificently, especially he of the City, the King's Standard being always carried before him, and the Drums beating when he goes out.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deriva∣tion of the Name, and Situation of <HI>Cambaya.</HI></NOTE>The City of <HI>Cambaya</HI> first receiv'd that Deno∣mination, though corruptly, from the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> for its right Name is <HI>Cambewath,</HI> or <HI>Cambebath,</HI> that is, <HI>The City Cambe.</HI> It lies in a pleasant Plain in the innermost Jaws of the great Gulf of <HI>Cambaya,</HI> so call'd from the City, near the Shore of the Ri∣ver <HI>Meli,</HI> or <HI>Mai,</HI> otherwise <HI>Guandari,</HI> at the place where it falls into this Bay, sixteen Leagues Northward from the City <HI>Brotcha,</HI> or <HI>Brotsch,</HI> and (according to <HI>Linschot</HI>) fifty three Leagues from <HI>Diu.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The compass and strength of it.</NOTE><HI>Cambaya</HI> being twice as big as <HI>Surratte,</HI> is two hours walking in circumference, and is surrounded with a double Stone Wall, which hath twelve Gates. Its chiefest Ornament consists in its great Suburbs. The Streets are streight and broad, and lock'd up every Night with a great pair of Gates. The Houses are partly of Brick, and partly of Free-stone, but all kept very moist, and conse∣quently cool, and would here be accounted but mean Houses, yet are reckon'd the best in the Countrey, being cover'd with Tyles, and having Gutters to receive the Rain-water, which in the three Summer Months falls in great abundance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Descri∣ption.</NOTE>The City is not very old, and perhaps built out of the Ruines of some other: It hath three great Market-places in the middle, and fifteen pleasant Gardens full of <HI>Mangas</HI>-trees, the Fruit whereof grows so plentifully here, that they are sent to all the adjacent Countreys; besides all which there are four Pools, out of which the Inhabitants have Water all the year.</P>
<P>On one side of the City is a a square Pool, rais'd with Marble, and several Steps on which they de∣scend to the Water; for besides that which is sav'd in these Pools during the rainy Season, there is little else in <HI>Cambaya.</HI></P>
<P>This City hath no Haven of any great conse∣quence, put onely a bare Road, by reason of the in∣convenient Situation and low Shore; yet it is call'd a Haven, because of the great number of Ships, which come thither from all Places. At High-water the Ships may Anchor close before the City, but lie dry at Low-water, which are only small Vessels, for Ships of Burthen are forc'd to
<PB N="213" REF="156"/>lie a good distance from the Shore in deeper Water.</P>
<P>The Ebb and Flood of the Sea about <HI>Cambaya</HI> is exceeding swift, the Sea rising in a moment, and in less than a quarter of an hour to its usual heighth; which is done with such wonderful swiftness, that no Horse can out-run the same; for it comes so furiously out of the Sea, that like a great Current it overflows a vast Tract of Land.</P>
<P>Many Villages are under the Jurisdiction of this City, where all Goods which are brought thi∣ther by Water, pay Three <HI>per cent.</HI> and Four if they come by Land.</P>
<P>This City was formerly the Seat of the King's of <HI>Surratte,</HI> and famous for Transporting of Agats and other Precious Stones.</P>
<P>Both without and within the City are many Hospitals for sick and maimed Beasts, as is already mention'd, which the <HI>Benjans</HI> look to, and cure with great care; for they abominate the killing of any Beast.</P>
<P>About a League and a half from <HI>Cambaya,</HI> in the way to <HI>Amadabat,</HI> lies a Village call'd <HI>Saima,</HI> seven Leagues and a half farther Southwards another nam'd <HI>Mator,</HI> and three from <HI>Cambaya,</HI> another call'd <HI>Sarode,</HI> which is inhabited by <HI>Rasbutes,</HI> who Rob on the High-ways and Rivers. Most of the Inhabitants are <HI>Pagans</HI> or Idolaters, who are very careful in the preservation of their Laws; the rest are either <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Mahumetans.</HI></P>
<P>In the Village <HI>Cansari,</HI> lying not far from the City, stands a <HI>Pagode,</HI> which hath several Cloy∣sters and Walks on the out side, built after a pretty kind of fashion, as also the whole Structure, which though it be not very big, yet it is built in a hand∣som method. Within this <HI>Pagode,</HI> which belongs to the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Vertias,</HI> who shave the Hair from off their Heads, stands upon a high Altar, which is ascended by Steps, an Idol, with divers burning Lamps hung before him. Hither resort many People to Offer Incense before the Idol.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is another square <HI>Pagode,</HI> furnish'd with divers Idols.</P>
<P>A League from <HI>Cambaya</HI> lies the Village <HI>Agra,</HI> which according to the Relation of the <HI>Benjans</HI> was anciently the Royal Seat, and chief City of the Kingdom of <HI>Surratte.</HI></P>

<P>The City, which is pretty large, lies on a Hill, and is naturally well fortifi'd, and by reason of its convenient Situation may be made the strongest Fortress of all <HI>India.</HI> It is surrounded with Walls of hard Stone, in manner like a Fort, and strength∣ned with Bulwarks, and hath three Land-Gates, each with a Portal, and according to the fashion of the Countrey is very strongly built; besides two more along the side towards the River, out of which the Water that is us'd in the City is fetch'd daily with Buffaloes. There also (with leave of the Receiver of the Customs) many Boats with Wood are unladen. On the Land they keep a strong Guard in several places, without whose leave none may pass through them.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants relate, and some old Rubies testifie, that <HI>Brotcha</HI> was formerly a stately City; but at present the best Houses are fall'n to ruine, and few People of note inhabit the same: Most of them being <HI>Benjans</HI> maintain themselves by ma∣king of Callicoes, which they sell to a good ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>About the City, or at the Foot of the Moun∣tain, lie two Suburbs call'd <HI>Poera,</HI> inhabited by People of several Nations, which also maintain themselves by making and Trading with Cotton Goods; and they make the best Callico that is to be had in all <HI>Surratte,</HI> and therefore send it to all parts of <HI>India.</HI> They also make strip'd Stuffs, half of Silk, and half of Cotton, which are much us'd, and highly esteem'd in <HI>India;</HI> for though it be wash'd never so often, it changes not its colour.</P>

<P><HI>Cheytepour</HI> is a Town of Village, lying six Leagues from <HI>Pettan,</HI> and forty five from <HI>Amada∣bat,</HI> built on the Banks of a pleasant Rivulet.</P>
<P><HI>Messane,</HI> an open Village, lying seven Leagues and a half from <HI>Cheytepour,</HI> hath an old decay'd Castle, where the Governor resides with two hun∣dred Horse.</P>
<P>A little League from <HI>Amadabat</HI> is a Village call'd <HI>Jessempour,</HI> which hath a great <HI>Sary,</HI> or House of Entertainment for Travellers.</P>
<P>A League and a half farther is another great Village nam'd <HI>Batova,</HI> with a large Pool.</P>
<P>Three Miles from <HI>Batova</HI> is a Village nam'd <HI>Canis,</HI> which lies near a River of the same Deno∣mination.</P>
<P>Fourteen Leagues from <HI>Amadabat,</HI> and nine from <HI>Brotcha,</HI> is a little Town call'd <HI>Nariadet,</HI> or <HI>Niriaud,</HI> or <HI>Nieriaut,</HI> built with fair Houses and <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples.</P>
<P>Seven Leagues and a half from <HI>Nariadet</HI> lies the Castle <HI>Wasset,</HI> with the Villages <HI>Sejantra</HI> and <HI>Ame∣nogy,</HI> between both, two or three Leagues one from another. It is an old decay'd Structure, built upon a high Hill near a River, which falls into the Bay of <HI>Cambaya.</HI> There are generally a hundred Horsemen in Garrison, who in the King's Name receive one <HI>Ropia</HI> and a half for every Carr which the <HI>Caffilas</HI> drive by this Place.</P>
<P><HI>Brodera,</HI> a Countrey Town, lies between <HI>Ama∣dabat</HI> and <HI>Brotcha,</HI> one and twenty Leagues East∣ward from the first, and thirty Westward from the last, on a sandy Plain near a small Rivulet nam'd <HI>Wasset.</HI> It was built by a <HI>Heathen</HI> call'd <HI>Ra∣sia Ghie,</HI> Son to <HI>Sultan Mahomed Begeran,</HI> the last King of <HI>Surratte,</HI> about a League and a half from old <HI>Brodera</HI> then call'd <HI>Radiapora,</HI> which by this means was ruin'd and left desolate, all the Inhabi∣tants going to the new <HI>Brodera.</HI> This Town or City, which is surrounded with Walls and Bul∣warks of Chalk and Stone, hath five Gates, one whereof is lately stopt up for want of a Way. On the West side is a large Suburb, inhabited by Weavers and Dyers, who are for the most part <HI>Benjans, Ketteyans,</HI> and a few <HI>Moors.</HI> Two hundred and twenty Villages are under the Jurisdiction of this City, seventy five whereof pay Tribute to the Governor for the maintaining of his Soldiers, the rest are by the King given to several of his Of∣ficers, that by some heroick Exploits or good Ser∣vice have oblig'd him, in requital whereof he gives them the Revenues of the foremention'd Villages to maintain them. Within the City are ten magnificent Houses, Gardens, and Tombs, whereof one very stately, built in the midst of an Orchard, is the Tomb of a mighty Lord and all his Family. Besides all these there are five plea∣sant Gardens full of Fruit-trees, Flowers and Herbs. On the East side, right before the Gate that leads to <HI>Brotcha,</HI> is a pretty deep Pool, about half a Furlong broad, and flank'd on one side with a Stone Wall, from whence the Inhabitants fetch all their Water.</P>
<P>On the East side also, about eight Leagues from <HI>Brodera,</HI> lies a Village call'd <HI>Sindickera;</HI> and five or six Leagues Westward from <HI>Brodera,</HI> are eight or ten Village more, which are all un∣der the Jurisdiction of <HI>Brodera;</HI> some Leagues from which, towards the side of <HI>Amadabat,</HI> lies a Castle or Fortress on a Mountain, surrounded with a Wall near a small Brook.</P>
<P>More Northerly is an old decay'd Town call'd <HI>Surbrodra,</HI> where there is a Custom-house. Next to that is the Village <HI>Amemoygra,</HI> where there is a Well of excellent Water.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Daman,</HI> a large City with a Castle.</NOTE>The City <HI>Daman,</HI> lying on the right hand, at the coming in of a Sea-Bay, forty Leagues South-East from <HI>Diu,</HI> in 20 Degrees Northern Latitude. It is a great City, situate near a River at the Sea, and fortifi'd with a strong Castle. <HI>Della Valle</HI> af∣firms, that it is not very big, but well built, and surrounded with strong Walls like a Fortress.

<P>The <HI>Blacks</HI> Natives of this Place Converted to <HI>Christianity,</HI> are the best Musquetteers of all <HI>India,</HI> of which they have given sufficient testi∣mony; for about the Year 1644. when the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Son Besieg'd this City with ten thousand Men, they behav'd themselves so bravely, that the said Prince having lost a great number of his Men, was forc'd to retreat from thence in a con∣fus'd manner.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rock <HI>Asserim.</HI></NOTE>The Fortress, or Rock of <HI>Asserim,</HI> lies up some Leagues farther into the Countrey, up which they generally climb bare-foot, that so they may take the surer footing, it being very high, steep, and slippery, insomuch that those who ascend the same, are in great danger of falling from the top to the bottom; or else if they ascend on the other side, they climb up by Ropes, with which they hoise up Cows and other things, which they want. And though this Rock lie between many other, which may easily be ascended, yet it is so high above them, that it seems to be a For∣tress which Commands over the rest: And as this Place is the Key to all the rest which the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> possess to the Northward in <HI>India,</HI> so it is likewise a great Eye-sore to the neighboring Kings, who have for that reason practis'd divers ways to conquer the same; which to prevent, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> are continually upon their Guard, espe∣cially at those Places which yield a good Prospect. On the top of the said Rock is a large Plain, sur∣rounded with many great Stones, which they throw down upon those that come to invade them. Not onely the Soldiers, but also the Inhabitants of the Place watch every Night, and carry Tor∣ches made of a kind of Wood, like Canes which last a long time, and cannot be put out by any Wind or Rain, which rather makes them burn the better. This Place is also a Sanctuary for all Cri∣minals, who repairing thither for shelter are re∣ceiv'd and kept there for Soldiers, which with their Wives and Children amounted formerly to about seven hundred. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> conquer'd this Rock in the time of the Governor <HI>Francis Borrero.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun∣trey of <HI>Sur∣ratte.</HI></NOTE>The Countrey of <HI>Surratte</HI> is interlac'd by many Rivers, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Nardabat</HI> which takes its course by the City <HI>Brotcha,</HI> and divides it self into two Arms, about four Leagues from the City towards the South near the Village <HI>Hansoot;</HI> in some pla∣ces it is one, and in others two Miles broad, and is divided by many other Streams, which have Pas∣sages into the Sea. The Soil is for the most part clayie, and mix'd with Sand, except near the City, where it is all Sand; it extends East North-East, and West South-West. The other Rivers are <HI>Wasset</HI> and <HI>Bate,</HI> which last springs out of the Mountains of <HI>Gate,</HI> and falling into the Gulf of <HI>Bambain,</HI> divides the Kingdom of <HI>Decan,</HI> and Countrey of <HI>Surratte</HI> or <HI>Cambaya.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tapta,</HI> otherwise <HI>Tyndee</HI> also glides between the Countrey of <HI>Surratte</HI> and that of the <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>
<P>The River <HI>May,</HI> otherwise <HI>Mehi,</HI> or <HI>Guandari,</HI> along whose Banks the City of <HI>Cambaya</HI> is built, is dry at low Ebb, except in three or four places, which having always about four or five Foot of Water, are dangerous to wade through without a good Guide, because of the strong Current that is in them. This River ebbs and flows daily seven Fathom perpendicular. At High-water the Ships come to an Anchor close before the City, but are left quite dry at Low-water. The Ground being sandy, and mix'd with Clay, is much better and easier for those Vessels that lie dry upon it, than if it were hard Sand.</P>
<P>About a League Southward from <HI>Cambaya</HI> glides the River <HI>Mihi,</HI> whose Shore must be travell'd at the low Ebb of the Sea, and not without great danger, because the Sea rising, flows up above five Leagues; and at low Tide you are forc'd to wade through two or three deep places: if any one should venture to wade through at the coming in of the Tide, he would undoubtedly be swallow'd by the Sea: for when the Water flows with great∣er strength, and higher than ordinary (for it ob∣serves no Rule, but rises and falls more or less ac∣cording to the course of the Moon,) it carries and washes away both Horse and Man, and often∣times with such force, that an Elephant cannot withstand the same, nor all his weight prevent him from being carried away; wherefore all tra∣vellers wait for a certain time to wade through the same, <HI>viz.</HI> when the Sea is low, which is at the new Moon, at which time they may go over it in Coaches or on Horseback without any danger; Coaches are commonly held fast on both sides, that they may not be overturn'd by the Waves▪ those that go on foot strip themselves naked, and tying up their Clothes, carry them on their Shoul∣ders: many times a whole Caravan, with abun∣dance of People, travel over the same, some in Coaches, some in Waggons, some on Horseback, and others on foot, both Men and Women stark naked, accounting it neither shameful nor immo∣dest. The Soil between both, <HI>viz.</HI> between the said River and the City <HI>Cambaya,</HI> is firm and hard, and is not overflown, though plain, and not far from the Sea.</P>
<P>In most Places of the Kingdom is excellent Water, except in the City of <HI>Cambaya,</HI> where there is great want of it. There are several Pools of Water in the Towns, and some of them so big, that the Inhabitants filling them in the Winter, have enough to serve them all the year.</P>
<P>In those Countreys which lie near the <HI>Indian Sea,</HI> is a certain rainy Season or Winter, <HI>viz.</HI> four Moneths in the year, beginning in <HI>June</HI> when the Sun enters into the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> and ending in <HI>September:</HI> If it Rains out of the Season, it is unusual, but betokens a fruitful year; for in the other eight Moneths the Weather is so serene and clear, that there is scarce a Cloud seen in the Skie; neither doth it rain constantly during the foremen∣tion'd four Months, as in <HI>Goa,</HI> but onely sometimes, especially at the beginning of the New and Full-Moon.</P>
<P>The Winds blow also here six Moneths Nor∣therly, and six Months Southerly.</P>
<P>The Weather is exceeding hot here in <HI>April, May,</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> and very unhealthful, occasioning Feavers and other Distempers, but when it begins to Rain, the Wind blows very strong, and tem∣pers the excessive Heat; but in the dry Season, it it hath this inconveniency, <HI>viz.</HI> it draws up the Dust like a Cloud, and disperses the same on Tra∣vellers, to their great annoyance.</P>
<P>In the rainy Season, especially in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> they Till their Lands, and Sowe their Corn, which being, moistned by the Rain, produces so rich and plentiful a Harvest, and such abundance of Grain, that all the adjacent Countreys are supply'd therewith: for <HI>Surratte</HI> (according to <HI>Linschot</HI>) is the fruitfullest Spot of Land in all <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey produces great quantities of Beans and Wheat, but much bigger and whiter than ours; also Barley, Rice, Tares, and Pease, which are less than those which grow in <HI>Europe;</HI> Linseed, and a small Seed call'd <HI>Thill,</HI> out of which they press abundance of Oyl. There is likewise a sort of Beans or grey Pease, which they call <HI>Danna,</HI> growing on little Stalks along the Ground, and serving the Horses in stead of Oats.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants Sowe abundance of Mustard-seed and Tobacco, which is much better than that
<PB N="216" REF="160"/>of other Places, but they cannot prepare the same so well as the People in the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Produ∣ctions of the Countrey.</NOTE>In the Gardens, which are very pleasant, and near the Towns, grow divers sorts of Herbs, both for the Pot and Salleting, also Raddishes, Tur∣nips. Cucumbers, Garlick, Onions, Beet-roots, Potatoes, and Colworts, besides eight or ten sorts of Drugs and little Herbs, as <HI>Turbith, Ga∣langa, Spica-nardi, Assa Foetida</HI> or <HI>Devils-dung, Bo∣ran,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>There is much Cotton, Silk, Sugar, Wax, many Fruit-trees and Plants, as Oranges, Pome∣granates, Lemmons, Limes, Citterns, <HI>Ananas, Bananas,</HI> Figs, <HI>Jackas, Coco</HI>-nuts in great abun∣dance, and in some peculiar Gardens Grapes, though not in very great plenty, and therefore are dearer than other Fruits.</P>
<P>The Fruit <HI>Mangas</HI> is much better here than in <HI>Ormuz,</HI> but not so big, yet of a more delicate smell, and having a small Kernel in the middle. They are transported to many Places, especially to the Village <HI>Chirches,</HI> two Leagues from the Metropo∣lis <HI>Amadabat,</HI> from whence it hath receiv'd its Name.</P>
<P>This Countrey hath plenty of Indigo, <HI>Cassia, Mirobolans, Calamba, Opium</HI> or <HI>Amphion,</HI> two sorts of Cummin, white and black Ginger, which be∣ing Preserv'd, is sent to <HI>Persia</HI> and other Places, as also certain Leaves, by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Tomala∣patra,</HI> Tamarinds, and <HI>Palmito</HI>-trees, besides many other wild Trees not known in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Bazaim</HI> grows a Tree which bears the Fruit call'd <HI>Jangomes.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey near about <HI>Brotcha,</HI> which is very low, and without Mountains, hath many Gardens, planted with <HI>Palmito</HI>-trees, out of which the Natives press a Wine in the Countrey Lan∣guage call'd <HI>Terry</HI> or <HI>Tory,</HI> which is drunk by ma∣ny. The Wine which drops from the foremen∣tion'd Tree in the Night, is pleasant and wholsom, but that which drops out of the same in the day∣time, being spoil'd by the Heat, is very hurtful for the Brain: It produces likewises plenty of Rice, Wheat, Barley, all sorts of Rice, and Cotton, but not in such abundance as in <HI>Nederbaer,</HI> and the adjacent Countreys.</P>
<P>The Mountains of <HI>Pindaetche</HI> are fertile in the production of Corn and other Grain, the Soil be∣ing Clay mix'd with black Earth.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Place make little Cheeses, which are very dry and Salt.</P>
<P>In <HI>Surratte</HI> are few Date, but many <HI>Coco</HI>-trees found.</P>
<P>The Trees and Fields are green all the year, but the Grass in the Summer is scorch'd up by the Sun; neither is the Grass Mow'd here as in <HI>Europe,</HI> but just when they have occasion for it, and as much at a time as may serve two or three days.</P>
<P>The Fields abound with a sort of Roses and Rosmary, which have no scent; nor have they have above two sorts of Flowers more all the year, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Mogeri,</HI> which is white, and the <HI>Schampi,</HI> which is yellow, both smelling very odo∣riferously, and worn by Women about their Necks, and strew'd in their Beds.</P>
<P>The Countrey round about <HI>Brodera</HI> and the ad∣jacent Villages is very fruitful, and produces Wheat, Barley, Rice, and other Grain, as also Cotton in great abundance.</P>
<P>The whole Coast of <HI>Bazaim</HI> hath plenty of Rice, Pease, and other Corn, besides Butter, Oyl, and <HI>Coco</HI>-nuts.</P>
<P>There are many <HI>Hiacinthes</HI> in this Kingdom, as also Diamonds, Pearls, Granads, Topas's, <HI>Corna∣lines, Spinellaes,</HI> and Amethists, besides Alabaster, red Marble, <HI>Hematites,</HI> or Blood-stones, and Jas∣pers, which are but little regarded. The Inhabi∣tants make green Dishes of their Jaspers, and Plates, which resemble those of <HI>Smerads:</HI> There are likewise <HI>Bezoar</HI> Stones, and also a Stone by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Olhos de Gata,</HI> or <HI>Cats-Eyes,</HI> and Agats in great abundance, of which they make curious Hafts of Knives at <HI>Cambaya,</HI> and many o∣ther Curiosities.</P>
<P>Abundance of Sealing-wax is made about the Village <HI>Amadabat,</HI> but the greatest part in the Village of <HI>Sindickera,</HI> eight Leagues Eastward from <HI>Brodera,</HI> and in many other Places in <HI>Surratte.</HI> It drops first out of several sorts of Trees, not un∣like the Thorn and Plumb-tree. When the Wax is raw, as it drops from the Tree, it is of a dark-brown colour, but being afterwards beaten to Powder, and melted with red, green, or black co∣lours, according as they please, and put on Sticks, it is sold here in <HI>Europe</HI> to Seal Letters with. They varnish many Ships therewith, as also Ta∣bles, Cabinets, Stools, Bedsteads, and other Wood-woork, which is the occasion that great quantities thereof are us'd in <HI>Surratte.</HI> The Enamel which they use with their Silver and Gold-works, as Hafts of Knives, and the like, they fill up with Wax within, and cover the same with Gold so neatly, that unless a Stranger were inform'd there∣of, he could not discover it from massy Gold.</P>
<P>Near the Village <HI>More,</HI> twenty nine Leagues from the City of <HI>Surratte,</HI> is a Spring, which casts up boyling hot Water at the foot of a Mountain, out of a hard Rock; a piece of Meat wrapt in Callico, is boyl'd in a short time therein, neither need they put Salt to it, because the Water is Salt, yet of a good taste, as if <HI>Alants</HI> Roots had been boyl'd therein.</P>
<P>Six clays Journey from the City <HI>Cambaya,</HI> is a Mountain, which produces <HI>Cornalines</HI> and <HI>Chalce∣dony;</HI> which last the Inhabitants (according to <HI>Barbosa</HI>) call <HI>Bacayores.</HI></P>
<P>A League from the City <HI>Brotcha</HI> is another rich Mine of <HI>Chalcedony</HI> and white Agats, which are commonly carry'd to <HI>Cambaya,</HI> and not to <HI>Brotcha;</HI> they make abundance of round and oval Dishes, and other small Vessels, of the same, for an Or∣nament in their Chambers.</P>
<P>In most Places of <HI>Surratte</HI> are abundance of Oxen, Cowes, Sheep from <HI>Persia,</HI> with large Tails, Goats, and Buffaloes, which yield good Milk and Butter, and Flesh which tastes like Beef, though spoil'd by the Heat of the Countrey. The Oxen no way differ from ours, onely they have a Bunch on their Shoulder.</P>
<P>Between the City of <HI>Amadabat</HI> and <HI>Surrate</HI> are many Goats, Stags, and wild Swine, Geese, and other Fowl, in great abundance; the Inhabitants seldom kill any of them, especially the <HI>Benjans.</HI> There are also many Horses, not onely of the Breed of the Countrey, but divers others, which being brought out of <HI>Tartary, Persia,</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> are sold at a dear rate, because they are accounted the best of all <HI>India;</HI> and they not onely take care to provide a Servant for every Horse, but also give them good Provender, <HI>viz.</HI> a sort of ground and boil'd Beans call'd <HI>Danna,</HI> and both Morning and Evening two pound of Barley Meal, mix'd with a pound and a half of Butter, and a pound of Sugar. They also keep many Camels, Mules,
<PB N="217" REF="160"/>Rhinocerots, Drommedaries, and Elephants, which are kept by the <HI>Mogol</HI> and Nobility in the Woods.</P>
<P>There are an innumerable company of wild Beasts, as Stags, Goats, <HI>Elands,</HI> wild Hogs, Asses, whose Flesh the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> eat in stead of Lamb, and Hares, which all Persons are permit∣ted to catch, except at the time when the King and his Nobles are Hunting; for then it is forbidden on pain of Death.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Woods are also the Recesses for Lyons, Tygers, Leopards (but neither Bears nor Wolves,) mad Dogs, which are call'd <HI>Jekkalla,</HI> abundance of Catamountains, and a Beast, which being almost like a Ferret, with a Tail like a Squir∣rel, doth great mischief to the Fruit, insomuch that the Husbandmen are forced to watch adays in the Fields when their Corn is ripe, to keep them from spoiling it.</P>
<P>There are likewise abundance of tame Fowls, as Hens, Cocks, Capons, Peacocks, Geese, Ducks, and Crop-Geese, which breed near the Rivers or Pools; besides Partridges, (which are there tame) and Pigeons. The Birds of prey are these, Fal∣cons, Hawks, Kites, Parrots, and other Birds not known to us in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Both within and without the City <HI>Amadabat</HI> are great numbers of Catamountains, which bree∣ding in the Woods, fearlesly frequent the Houses, and do great damage to those that deal in Fruit, as Dates, Almonds, Figs, Raisins, and the like; of which they take what they like best.</P>
<P>Between the City <HI>Cambaya</HI> and <HI>Amadabat,</HI> near the Village <HI>Mater,</HI> are abundance of excellent blood-colour'd Squirrels, with curious large Tails; which breeding on Trees, leap nimbly from one to another.</P>
<P>Many Bats, which are as big as Hens, and have Heads resembling those of Cats, frequent the Woods, and are by some call'd Flying-Cats. Be∣tween <HI>Cambaya</HI> and <HI>Amadabat</HI> are likewise Bats as big as Ravens.</P>
<P>There are also great numbers of Crows, which flying through the Windows into the Houses, take the Meat out of the Dishes without any fear of the People that are present: They commonly sit on the Backs of the Buffaloes, and peck off their Hair; which is the reason that most of the fore∣mention'd Beasts in these Parts are bald: nor have they any other way to free themselves of the said Fowls, but to run up to their Throats into a Mo∣rass.</P>
<P>Rats also breed here in great abundance, and some of them are so big that no Cats dare venture to seize on them; and oftentimes throw down Houses, by undermining the Walls and Founda∣tions thereof: they do likewise great mischief to the Plants and Trees.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are daily much infested with Bugs, which filling the Houses in great swarms, sting the People.</P>
<P>The Rivers, especially the <HI>Indus</HI> and others, abound with all manner of delicate Fish, <HI>viz.</HI> Carps, Bremes, Eels, Trouts, Shrimps, and many other <HI>European</HI> Fishes, besides such as are peculiar to those Parts. In the Stream <HI>Indus</HI> breed likewise many Crocodiles or <HI>Caimans.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents, and other noxious Creatures.</NOTE>About <HI>Amadabat</HI> are abundance of poysonous Serpents and Scorpions, which in all parts of <HI>In∣dia</HI> are not alike venomous: for the Sting of a Scorpion on the Island of <HI>Great Java,</HI> occasions great swelling, and exceeding pain; but is easily cur'd, if Medicines be apply'd thereunto within the space of twelve hours after; but if any one be stung by a Scorpion on the Main, he certainly dies within the space of three hours, if he doth not in∣stantly cut the wounded part till it bleeds, and then anointing it with Oyl of Scorpions, sear it with a red hot Iron. Moreover the oylie moi∣sture, which is extracted from the Scorpion which hath stung the Party, is also an excellent Remedy, if immediately laid on the Wound. The Scorpi∣ons resemble in shape the Cra-fish or Lobsters. Before they are boil'd they have a little round Tail, which erecting it self, reclines backward; at the end thereof is the Sting, which they never draw in, or put out, like other venomous Crea∣tures, but always have the same ready to sting those which approach them: The Sting is very hard, sharp, and long, like an Iron Hook. The Scorpions, and another sort of Vermin call'd <HI>Mille∣pes,</HI> from its number of Feet, breed for the most part on old decay'd Walls.</P>
<P>There are also a sort of Scorpions with two Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> one before, and the other behind the Tail; and it is said that they move one Head one year, and the other another year; and are by some in <HI>Greek</HI> call'd' <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which signifies a thing that can go backwards or forwards.</P>
<P>These two-headed Serpents have occasioned great Disputes amongst the Philosophers: for some, as <HI>Aelianus, Pliny, Lucan, Galen, Nierenbergh.</HI> and <HI>Olearius,</HI> certainly believe that there are really such Serpents: But <HI>Andreas Matthiolus,</HI> in his Ex∣planation of <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> and <HI>John Faber Linceus,</HI> in his History of <HI>Mexico,</HI> contradicts this Opinion, and looks upon it as a fabulous Tradition, judging this mistake to proceed from hence, <HI>viz.</HI> because the forementioned Serpents are as thick at their Tail as at their Head; so that there can be no distinction made; moreover, that they creep as well back wards as forwards, and have veno∣mous Stings in their Tails as well as in their Heads.</P>

<P>This Countrey is also exceeding pester'd with little Pismires, which are no small annoiance to the Inhabitants, who can scarce set any Meat out of their Hands, but in a moment several hundreds crawl upon the same; which to prevent, they ge∣nerally keep in their Houses stone Troughs full of Water, in the middle of which laying a great Stone, they lay their Meat upon it, in a Cupboard made for that purpose.</P>
<P>By reason of the many Woods and Trees that are about and near <HI>Amadabat,</HI> there are great plenty of wild Beasts and Fowls, especially Parrots of all sorts; some whereof are very big, and are by se∣veral <HI>Europeans</HI> call'd <HI>Indian Ravens;</HI> and some be∣ing no bigger than Pigeons, are for their sweet Voices call'd <HI>Cacatu:</HI> They are of a yellowish colour, and have a Tuft of Feathers on their Heads: They make their Nests under the Roofs of Houses, and are found in great numbers in most Towns of all <HI>India.</HI> Others which are less, are red and green, and building their Nests of long withered Grass, make them fast to the Boughs of Trees, that so they may be freed from Vermin. These Parrots do great mischief to all Fruits and Corn, especially Rice.</P>

<P>One of the remaining two Ships went to a <HI>Raja</HI> residing at <HI>Baryacy</HI> near <HI>Surratte,</HI> where the People aboard her were receiv'd upon the same Conditi∣ons as the former. But this <HI>Raja</HI> being at Wars with another <HI>Raja,</HI> was defeated, his Countrey taken from him, and all the <HI>Persians,</HI> as his Abet∣ters, destroy'd by his Enemies.</P>
<P>The seventh and last Vessel Sailing along the Coast, touched at <HI>Cambaya,</HI> where the People that were in the same were receiv'd on the same Con∣ditions as the former. So that these People, after what manner soe're spread through <HI>India,</HI> had cer∣tainly their Extract from one of the foremention'd Places, where they liv'd so long, that they forgot their Original and Religion, nay, they could not remember from whence they were Extracted, till at length, after the expiration of many years, the Name of <HI>Persians</HI> was made known to them by those that having remain'd in <HI>Persia,</HI> disclos'd to them the History of their Predecessors, instructed them in their ancient Religion, and taught them how to serve God for the future: so that at present, wheresoe're they are, they strictly maintain their ancient Religion or Sect; and many <HI>Persians</HI> have since Setled themselves along the Sea-shore, where they have liv'd quietly among the Natives. But <HI>Herbert,</HI> contrary to the opinion of all Historians, tells us, that King <HI>Jazdgerd</HI> banish'd them to <HI>India,</HI> because they refus'd to embrace the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Doctrine, and to be Circumcised.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apparel or the <HI>Persi∣ans</HI> of <HI>Sur∣ratte.</HI></NOTE>As to what concerns the Apparel of these <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI> they are Clothed after the same fashion as the Inhabitants, except that they ware a Girdle or Sash of Camels Hair or Sheeps Wooll, which go∣ing twice about their Middle, is ty'd behind with two Tassels. This Sash or Girdle is by them call'd <HI>Cushee,</HI> and worn as a publick testimony of their Faith, in the nature or our Baptism, or the Cir∣cumcision of the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> and is given them at their being initiated into their Religion in the seventh year of their Age. When accidentally they lose one of these Girdles or Sashes, they are not permi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted to eat, drink, work, speak, or stir, before they have obtain'd another: And these Girdles are to be bought of their Priests. As well Women as Men are obliged to wear these Sashes from the seventh year of their Age, or (as others affirm) from their twelfth year, which is from the time of their being initiated. They live here like the Natives, free and undisturbed, and drive what Trade they please. They are very ingeni∣ous, and for the most part maintain themselves with Tilling, and buying and selling all sorts of Fruits, tapping of Wine out of the Palm-trees; which Wine they sell in Houses of Entertain∣ment: for their Law debars them not from drink∣ing strong Liquor, so it be not the Juice of the Grape. Some also Traffick, and are Exchangers of Money, keep Shops, and exercise all manner of Handicrafts, except Smiths-work, for they are not allow'd to quench Fire with Water.</P>
<P>In point of Eating and Drinking, their Law hath given them great Priviledge;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Diet.</NOTE> but to avoid displeasing of the <HI>Benjans,</HI> amongst whom they live, and the <HI>Moors,</HI> under whose Jurisdiction they stand, they abstain from Wine, that is, the Juice of the Grape, and Swines-flesh; but of the Palm-Wine they drink very greedily, insomuch that it is usual among some, making up a Palm-leaf in form of a Tunnel, to let the Palm-Wine run through the same into their Throats. They al∣ways eat alone by themselves, judging that they are able to live pure and undefiled; that if they should eat with any person, they would certainly be defiled: They also drink out of several Cups; and if any Person chances accidentally to drink out of anothers Cup, they wash the same three times, and set it away for a considerable time be∣fore they use it again.</P>
<P>Some affirm, that their Law forbids them to eat of any thing that enjoyed Life, except in times of War or great Necessity; for then they are per∣mitted to eat Mutton, Goats-flesh, Venison, Poul∣trey, and Fish, and all manner of Flesh, except that of Cows, Oxen, Horses, Camels, Elephants, and the like Beasts, which they account a deadly sin to kill; but they chiefly abstain from Cows or Ox-flesh, affirming, that they will rather eat their Father or Mothers Flesh: In which Point of Re∣ligion they agree with the <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>

<P>Most of their Liquor is Water, because their Law forbids them to drink any Liquor made by the Fire; but they have free leave to drink of the Juice of the Grape, or any other Wines tapt out of Trees, but not to that excess as to inebriate themselves; which nevertheless oftentimes hap∣pens amongst them in private, but if it be disco∣vered either in Men or Women, they are sorely punished, and if they do not heartily repent (at least seemingly) and do Penance, they are ba∣nished, and disown'd by their Tribe.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Fasting: after each Fast-day they eat but once for five days after, in commemoration that God rested five days after each of his Labors.</P>
<P>If they at any time eat Flesh or Fowl, they car∣ry a piece thereof to their <HI>Eggaree,</HI> or Temple, as an Offering, to beg pardon of their Gods, and to testifie the dissatisfaction which they have in be∣ing forc'd to kill his Creatures for their Food.</P>

<P>The Men wear great round Beards, long black Hair on their Heads, and are generally hook∣nos'd, which makes them to be known amongst thousands of People; yet there are some that wear short Hair, with a Lock onely on the top of their Crown.</P>
<P>There are few amongst them that serve other People, alledging, That if any one dies in ano∣ther Man's Service, it will be very difficult for him to go to Heaven, as having sinned against God; wherefore those that serve, are accounted unclean and Unbelievers.</P>
<P>They are for the most part a covetous and hard People, very deceitful in their Dealings, but no way inclin'd to Whoring or Theft; meek and compassionate in their Conversation. They dwell in very dark Houses, meanly furnish'd, in one Street or Ward by themselves.</P>
<P>They have no supreme Governor amongst them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their several Feasts.</NOTE>They have six Festival Times in a year, which by virtue of their Law they are oblig'd to main∣tain, in commemoration of the six days wherein God created the World, and for the Benefits which they receive every Month from God.

<P>The first of these Feasts, call'd <HI>Meduserum,</HI> be∣gins on the fifteenth of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere,</HI> or <HI>February,</HI> in com∣memoration that God made Heaven, and appoin∣ted it to be a Place of Bliss and Happiness, for the reception of all such as fear him.</P>
<P>The second Feast, call'd <HI>Petusathan,</HI> begins on the twenty sixth of <HI>Sheruar,</HI> or <HI>April,</HI> in comme∣moration that God made Hell for the Devils and bad Angels, and to deter Men from living wickedly.</P>
<P>The third call'd <HI>Yatrum,</HI> begins on the twenty sixth of <HI>Nahar,</HI> or <HI>May,</HI> in remembrance that God created the Sea and Earth, and made them fit for the production of such Creatures as preserve the Life of Man.</P>
<P>The fourth nam'd <HI>Medearum,</HI> begins on the sixteenth of <HI>Foz,</HI> or <HI>July,</HI> in remembrance that God made Trees and Plants, whose Fruits serve for the Sustenance of Mankind.</P>
<P>The fifth call'd <HI>Homespotamadum,</HI> begins on the thirteenth of <HI>Spindamud,</HI> or <HI>August,</HI> in commemo∣ration that God created Beasts, Fowls, and Fishes, for the Food of Man.</P>
<P>The sixth call'd <HI>Medusan,</HI> begins on the thir∣teenth of <HI>Ardehert,</HI> or <HI>December,</HI> in token of joy that God about that time created a Man and a Woman, from whom the whole Earth was peo∣pled.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Original Fire-wor∣ship.</NOTE>Amongst all things which they possess, nothing is of such veneration amongst them as the Fire, on which their Belief is grounded, and which they worship; and herein they differ from all other Sects. This worshipping of Fire hath its original from one <HI>Zertoost</HI> their Law-giver, who, as their
<PB N="220" REF="162"/>Tradition goes, ascended to Heaven, and brought down a portion of Fire, which God gave him, together with the Book of their Laws. They al∣ledge moreover, that <HI>Zertoost</HI> ascending to Hea∣ven, saw not God in his full glory, but that he spoke with him over a great Fire, out of which God gave him the said portion, and also endued him with some of his Divine Power. They say likewise, That the Fire which he brought out of Heaven, was a living Fire, which could not be extinguish'd by any means, and therefore that it had Divine Worship ascrib'd to it. But it is not certainly believ'd amongst them, that the fore∣mention'd Fire hath hitherto been preserved; however, they are permitted to make another Fire of severall Materials, which they are to keep al∣ways burning, and to worship according to the Commands of their Law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cere∣monies of Fire-worship.</NOTE>Their grand Ceremonies of Fire-worship are at present perform'd in <HI>Surratte,</HI> on a Place call'd <HI>Nuncery,</HI> where the chief Priesthood of this Sect reside, and, according to their relation, have kept the Fire constantly burning above two hundred and fifty years. This Fire is by them in their Lan∣guage call'd <HI>Antisbehur,</HI> that is, <HI>Sacred Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The worshipping of this Fire, which the <HI>Di∣stoor</HI> or <HI>Herbood</HI> (that is the High-Priest) keeps so carefully, that he never lets the same go out, is perform'd in the following manner:</P>
<P>As often as the <HI>Persians</HI> meet to worship the Fire, the <HI>Distoor</HI> or <HI>Herbood</HI> tells them, That the Fire was given from God to <HI>Zertoost,</HI> as a part of his Power and Glory; and that he had also given him a Law which taught him to worship the same, and was confirm'd by many Miracles; there∣fore they must esteem it sacred and holy, and worship and reverence the same, as being a part of God himself, and of the same Essence and like∣ness with him, or at least differing little from him; that they must love all things that resemble the, as the Sun and Moon, which were made of the same, and are two testimonies of God, and would come to be Witnesses against them, if they neg∣lected this their Duty, to which they were so strictly commanded. Moreover, he admonishes them to worship God, and beg pardon of him, if accidentally they should spill any Water in the foremention'd Element of Fire, which being so useful for Mankind, might thereby happen to be extinguish'd; and not to spit in the same, or throw any unclean thing into it to make it burn. They therefore keep always Fire in their Houses, and will never blow out a Candle, Lamp, or any other Light, or quench Fire with Water, though their Houses should be all in a Flame, but endea∣vour to smother the same with Earth; for they ac∣count it an ill omen, and a sign of God's anger, when the Fire in their Houses chances to go out, and they be forc'd to fetch Fire out of other Hou∣ses to kindle it again.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The initiation of their Chil∣dren.</NOTE>As to what concerns the Initiating of their Children; so soon as a Child comes into the World, the <HI>Daroo</HI> or Priest goes to the Parents House, and having enquired into the Hour and Minute of the Infants Birth, he first erects a Scheme, then consults with the Father and Mo∣ther about naming of the Child; which as soon as they have agreed upon, the Mother, in presence of the whole Company, gives the Child its Name, without any other Ceremony; which done, the Mother and Father taking the Child, follow the <HI>Daroo</HI> to the <HI>Eggaree</HI> or Temple, where the Priest takes clear Water, which he stirs in the Bark of a certain Tree growing near <HI>Yesd</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> call'd <HI>Holma,</HI> on which it is affirm'd the Sun never makes any shadow, and at last taking up a handful of the said Water, sprinkles the Child therewith, and prays to God that he would cleanse the Child from his Fathers and Mothers Uncleanness: which said, he leaves the Infant with the Parents. When the Child is attain'd to the seventh year of its Age, and judg'd fit to be receiv'd and made a Member of their Church, the Parents carry it to the Temple to be instructed; where the <HI>Daroo</HI> teaches the Youth several Prayers, and instructs him in his Religion. The Child being perfect herein, repeats all the Prayers which he hath learn'd, over a Fire, with a Cloth ty'd about his Head, which covers his Mouth and Nostrils, so to prevent the Breath which comes out of his un∣clean Body from blowing upon, and thereby defi∣ling the holy Fire. After performance of these Prayers, the <HI>Daroo</HI> gives the Child Water to drink, and the Rind of a Pomegranate to chew, thereby to cleanse it from its inward uncleanness: Then they wash his Body with clean Water, and put him on a <HI>Shuddero,</HI> or Cotton Coat, which reaches down to his Ancles, and also give him a Girdle made of Camels Hair, by them call'd <HI>Cu∣shee,</HI> which the Youth must never leave off. After all this, the <HI>Daroo</HI> says this Prayer following:
<Q>God grant that you may be a faithful Maintainer, all your Life, of the <HI>Persian</HI> Religion, of which your Habit is a Efficient Badge; and never believe any other Law but that which <HI>Zertoost</HI> brought with him from Hea∣ven. Moreover, that you may always remain constant in the worshipping of the Fire, neither eat the Meat of others, nor drink out of their Cups, but undefil'd pre∣serve the Ceremonies and Customs of the <HI>Persians.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This done, the Youth passes for a real <HI>Persian,</HI> and one of their Sect.</P>
<P>They have five different kinds of Marriage among them, which have each their proper Name:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Marri∣ages.</NOTE> The first, call'd <HI>Shausan,</HI> is a Marriage of the Son of one Man to the Daughter of another during their Minority, which the Parents manage among them∣selves, without the knowledge of their Children. This sort of Marrying is highly esteem'd amongst them, affirming, That those who are thus Mar∣ry'd shall undoubtedly go directly to Paradise.</P>
<P>The second sort of Marrying, call'd <HI>Chockerson,</HI> is when a Widow Marries a second Husband.</P>
<P>The third, nam'd <HI>Codesherahassan,</HI> is when a Woman makes choice of a Man her self.</P>
<P>The fourth, nam'd <HI>Ectsan,</HI> is when a Youth or Maid dies, after having been Betrothed, before the consummation of the Marriage: for in such Cases they have a Custom to give another Youth or Maid in Marriage to the Deceased, because they account Marriage to be a great means to make Men happy in the other World. Persons of Quality commonly Marry after this manner, be∣cause with their Money they purchase such as will undertake such a Marriage as is before men∣tioned.</P>
<P>The fifth, nam'd <HI>Ceterson,</HI> is when a Father, having no Sons, but having a Daughter Married who hath Sons, takes one of them to be his real Son, and gives him in Marriage as his own Child; for they esteem a Man most miserable who hath no Children to bestow in Marriage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Nupti∣al Ceremo∣nies.</NOTE>The Ceremonies which they use at their Mar∣riages, are these: After the Parties who are to be Married have seen one another, they meet at mid∣night

</FIGURE> to conclude the Agreement; and the Bride and Bridegroom sitting down by each other on a Bed (for they are never Married in a Church or Temple,) there stand opposite to them two holy Persons, the one declaring himself for the Bride∣groom, and the other for the Bride, whilst the Pa∣rents place themselves on the right and left Hand of the <HI>Herbood,</HI> who being for both Parties, holds a Rice Corn in his Hand as a sign and testimony of Fruitfulness, which he wishes them at their Mar∣riage: the holy Person that hath declared him∣self for the Bridegroom laying the Brides fore Fin∣ger on her Forehead, asks her if she be willing to have that Man? to which she having reply'd <HI>Yes,</HI> the other holy Person asks the same of the Bride∣groom; who also answering <HI>Yes,</HI> the Bride there∣upon being commanded by the two holy Persons, gives the Bridegroom her Hand; whereupon he promises to give her a sum of Money, and declares that he will not let her want any thing that is fit for her, but give her all things that she shall re∣quire; she likewise promising, that all things she possesses shall be his. After this the <HI>Herboods</HI> or holy Men strew Rice upon them, and say several Prayers, imploring God to bless them, and give them Sons and Daughters in great numbers, which in time may multiply as the Rice which is sown in the Ground, and to grant that they may live long in peace and tranquility. Then the Brides Parents give the Bridegroom such Goods as they are able to part with, and begin the Solemnity of the Wedding, which lasts eight days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Bury∣ing Places.</NOTE>Their Burying-places are built round a good heighth from the Ground, pretty broad, and pav'd with Free-stone: In the midst of them is a deep Well, into which drop the Bones of the Deceased, the Bodies both of Men and Women being hung round the Wall in the open Air.</P>
<P>These Burying-places are of two sorts, and stand some distance from each other; the one is appointed for those that have lived piously and honestly, and the other for those that have liv'd viciously and wickedly, and those that have com∣mitted Crimes, and were punish'd for them whilst they liv'd.</P>
<P>When any Person amongst them lies upon his Death-bed, they send for a <HI>Herbood</HI> or Priest, who whispers this following Prayer in the dying Per∣son's Ear, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O Lord, thou hast commanded us not to sin, yet ne∣vertheless this Person hath sinned; thou hast comanded us to do good, yet this Person hath done ill, thou hast commanded us to worship thee, yet this Person hath neg∣lected it; but nevertheless, good Lord, pardon his Crimes and offences.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Funeral Solemnities.</NOTE>As soon as the Breath is departed out of the Body, the Priest keeps ten Foot distance from the same, and commands the <HI>Nicesselars,</HI> or Bearers, to carry it away on an Iron Bier; for by virtue of their Law they may not touch any dead Corps with Wood, because it is a Material with which they keep in the Fire which they worship. More∣over, those that accompany the Corps, are forbid to speak, because the Grave, according to their Opinion, must be a Place of Rest and Quietness. Coming to the place where the Defunct is to be buried, the Bearers set down the Corps, whilst the Priests, who stand at some distance from thence, speak the following words: <HI>When this our Brother liv'd, he was conjoin'd of four Elements; now he is dead, let each Element take his own: the Earth, the Earth; the Water, the Water; the Air, the Air; and the Fire, the Fire.</HI> Next they implore <HI>Sertau</HI> and <HI>Asud</HI> (whose Offices are to wait on <HI>Lucifer</HI>) and some other Daemons, that they would prevent all evil Spirits from doing the Deceased any harm, when he shall go to cleanse himself by their ce∣lestial Fire: for the Soul, as they believe, re∣mains ranging up and down the Earth three days after; during which time <HI>Jupiter,</HI> they say, would torment the same, if it did not flie to the sacred Fire to avoid his punishments: After this the Soul being try'd, is according to her behaviour, either condemn'd to go to Hell, or convey'd to
<PB N="222" REF="163"/>Heaven. As this Opinion is firmly rooted in them, so they forget not to meet every Morning, Noon, and Evening, during the space of three days, to implore God to shew Mercy to the Soul of the Deceased, and to pardon the Sins which he hath committed in his Life-time. After the expiration of the three days, when the Soul hath received her sentence, then the Relations make a great Feast on the fourth day, and so end their Mourning.</P>
<P>One <HI>Twist</HI> tells us, That they take the Sick from his Bed, and laying him on the Ground, or a Bed of Sand, let him die there; and about thir∣ty or forty days after the Burying of the Dead, they carry the said Bed of Sand, and strew the same on his Grave. But <HI>Herbert</HI> saith, That they wrap up their deceas'd Bodies in a perfum'd Cloth; and that the Relations which accompa∣ny the Corps to the Grave, go beating them∣selves, yet with a profound silence, till they come within fifty or a hundred Paces from the Place of Interment, where the <HI>Herboot</HI> at a lesser distance from the Grave expects them, having a yellow Cloth wrapp'd about his Body, and a little Tul∣bant on his Head. The Bearers carry the Corps to a little House built like an Oven, where they perform certain ancient Ceremonies; which done, they draw the Body up to the top of a round Stone Building, of twelve Foot high, and twen∣ty four in Circumference, with a double Entrance on the North-East side, consisting of two Holes, through which they put the Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> those that have lived well, through the one; and the wicked, through the other.</P>
<P>This Structure is flat on the top, and paved with white Clay, which, when dry, is very hard and smooth, like Plastering: In the middle there is left an open Hole, into which fall the Bones of the Deceased, who are laid naked in two Rows on this Structure, in the heat of the Sun, and serve for Food for the Fowls of the Air, which in great numbers coming thither, tear and disfi∣gure the Bodies after a horrid manner: And the Air round about this Place is in the heat of Sum∣mer so infected with the smell of the corrupted Carcasses, which often lie to the number of three or four hundred on the top of the forementioned Place, that it often occasions great Sicknesses especially in Strangers.</P>
<P><HI>Twist</HI> affirms, That these Burying Places are a League or more From the Towns or Villages to which they belong, and being built of Stone, are about three Fathom high, with a Hole in the middle, over which the Deceased are laid for the Fowls to devour; and their Flesh being consum'd, their Bones fall through an Iron Grate into the foremention'd Hole or Pit. These kind of Grave are of three several sorts; one for Men, another for Women, and the third for Children.</P>
<P>On the North side of the City <HI>Surrat,</HI> beyond the great Pool of Water before describ'd, and about a Bowe-shoot beyond the great Prince Garden, the <HI>Persians</HI> have three round Stone Towers, about a Pistol-shot from each other, and about three Fathom high, where they also dispose of their Dead. In each of these Towers is a Door or Entrance about six Foot from the Ground, through which they draw the dead Bo∣dies up to the top, which are made flat, and so as that the Corps may lie round in three Rows, in Troughs or Chests of about half a Foot deep.</P>
<P>They account the Bodies of Men to be much more unclean than those of Beasts, and more espe∣cially the Bones of them; for they will by no means touch the Bones of a dead Man or Wo∣man: And if any should chance accidentally to touch them with their Clothes, they are oblig'd immediately to put them off, and all things they have on, and throw them away, as being un∣clean; and after having wash'd their whole Bo∣dies, to put on others, and stay within nine days, without driving any Trade, or so much as touch∣ing their Wives or Children.

<P>The Ships which Sail thither from <HI>Surrat,</HI> though big enough, are very ill built, their Guns being placed upon the Deck, without any shelter against the Weather.

When he rides abroad, which for the most part is on a well-caparison'd Elephant, he is attended by all the Nobility, and several Horsemen, to the num∣ber of two hundred Persons, armed with Bowes, Pikes, Shields, and Swords. Before him are led several Elephants with rich Trappings, adorn'd with Pennons and Flags, and accompanied with Drummers, Trumpetters, and others: Yet never∣theless he goes but mean in Apparel, and com∣monly in Black Cotton Cloth; whilst, on the contrary, his Servants go very rich and gay.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chan</HI> is obliged always to keep 1200 <HI>Les∣cheri</HI> or Troopers for the <HI>Mogol,</HI> and fifty Ele∣phants, besides fifty for his own use. The Re∣venues with wich they are maintain'd, are rais'd from the Towns and Villages under their Jurisdi∣ction, as likewise the Forces with which the <HI>Chan</HI> is guarded; the City <HI>Amadabat,</HI> eighteen substi∣tute Towns, and a thousand Villages, being able to raise 140000 Men.

Poor Criminals are, for petty Thefts, and other small Offences, whipp'd several days together with a great Whip call'd <HI>Siambak;</HI> but for grand Faults, as Breaking open of Houses, and the like, they have their Hands and Feet cut off, or some other severe Punishments inflicted upon them. Robbers on the High-way, if they buy not their Lives with a great Sum of Money, are Decollated, and their Bodies put on Stakes plac'd alog the Roads. Murder is amongst them accounted an unpardonable Crime; as also Adul∣tery, especially in Women of Quality: And for the preventing of the last, Common Whores are freely permitted to dwell in every City, who, with permission of the Sheriff, to whom they pay a certain Acknowledgment, may go to any Per∣son that sends for them, or be visited in their own Houses; which rather tends to their Honour, than Disgrace: for there are no Feasts accounted Com∣pleat and Noble, unless there be present some of these Common Women to Dance and Sing be∣fore the Guests.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Religion of the <HI>Sur∣ratteans.</HI></NOTE>As to what concerns the Religion of the <HI>Sur∣ratteans,</HI> some of them, especially the Chiefest, are <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> the rest, <HI>Benjans, Brah∣mines,</HI> and other sorts of <HI>Pagans.</HI></P>
<P>There are in <HI>Surrat</HI> many <HI>Gioghi's,</HI> a People much resembling the <HI>Romish</HI> Monks, being in se∣verity of Life and outward Penitence inferior to none; for they go stark naked in the coldest Wea∣ther, and sleeping on Horse-dunghils, cover their Heads and Faces therewith, and wear very long Hair, which makes them look frightful and de∣form'd.</P>
<P>The People are very Charitable, being much inclin'd to the giving of Almes to the Poor, very Pious, and sollicitous of their Salvation, though deluded by their Teachers; some giving twenty five, others fifty Ducats at a time, and some more. <HI>Perushi</HI> affirms. That <HI>Anno</HI> 1595. there was on one day, <HI>viz.</HI> the eighth of <HI>January,</HI> above a Tun of Gold given in Alms. The reason of this great Charity on that day, is upon the account of some grand Tradition mentioned in their Law-book. Their two main Duties, next to giving of Alms, are Pilgrimage, and doing of Penance.</P>
<P>Out of the City <HI>Cambaya,</HI> saith <HI>Peruschi,</HI> go many Heathens in Pilgrimage to the River <HI>Ganges</HI> in <HI>Bengala,</HI> sometimes to the number of forty or fifty thousand, all those accounting themselves happy that have been bath'd in the foremention'd Stream; and they certainly believe they shall be sav'd, if on their Death-beds they can but get some of the Water of the <HI>Ganges</HI> to drink.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Benjans</HI> have a peculiar Opinion of the Creation and Original of Men, and differ in this point from the <HI>Brahmines,</HI> notwithstanding they account them to be their Teachers, it will not be amiss to declare the same, as it is taken out of their Law-book call'd <HI>Shaster.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Opinion of the <HI>Benjans</HI> concerning the Creation.</NOTE>God seeing himself alone, he studied after what manner he might manifest to others his Splendor and Power; for he foresaw, that his Greatness and Glory would remain obscure, and never be known, if he did not communicate them to Mortals. The most convenient means there∣fore to attain to this his desire, was to Create the World, and all the Creatures which are in the same. And in order hereunto, he first made the World, beginning with the four Elements, which were to be the Foundation thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earth, Air, Water, and Fire; which in the beginning be∣ing mix'd together, were separated after this man∣ner: First he blew on the Water with a large <HI>Sar∣batane,</HI> or the like Instrument, which thereupon bubling up, came to be a great Body in the form of an Egg, which by degrees extending, became the light and clear shining Firmament of Heaven, which surrounds the whole World. This sepa∣ration being made, the Earth remained mix'd with a Matter like Sediment of Water, of which God afterwards made a round Ball, and call'd the Lower World, of which the firmest part became Earth, and the other, being the weakest, the Sea; both which making the exact Figure of a Globe, God plac'd the same in the midst of the Firmament which surrounds the Sea and Earth.</P>
<P>After this, God Created a Sun and Moon, which he placed in the Firmament, to make a di∣stinction of the Times and Seasons. And by this means the four Elements, which before were con∣fusedly mix'd together, were separated and di∣stinguish'd, and each confin'd to its proper place.</P>
<P>The Elements thus setled, each perform'd its Office: The Air fill'd all things that were empty; the Fire by its Heat gave warmth to all; and the
<PB N="225" REF="164"/>Earth and Sea produc'd their several Creatures, God giving a generative Power to all to multi∣ply and increase, according to their several kinds. And thus the great World being perfected, was divided into four Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> East, West, North, and South. This World was to last four Ages, and to be inhabited by divers sorts of People, which were to be produc'd from four Men and four Women, as we will instantly relate.</P>
<P>God having thus created the World and the Creatures, he proceeded to create Man, and there∣upon commanded the Earth to produce that ex∣cellent Creature out of its Bowels: First it put forth the Head, and soon after all the other Parts; into which God breathing Life, the Lips grew red, the Eye-lids open'd, and made two sparkling Stars to appear; the other Parts of the Body be∣gan to move, and his Senses with Wisdom, knew their Creator and worshipp'd him. And because this Creature (which was made for Society) should not be alone, God gave him a Woman for his Companion, which resembled him as well in his Sense, Reason, and Spirit. This first Creature was call'd <HI>Pourus,</HI> and his Wife <HI>Parkoute;</HI> they liv'd together like Man and Wife, and fed upon the Fruit of the Earth, without killing any living Creature. These two Persons living thus toge∣ther, begat four Sous; the first whereof was call'd <HI>Brammon,</HI> the second <HI>Kutterey,</HI> the third <HI>Schuddery,</HI> and the fourth <HI>Wyse.</HI> These four Brothers were of different Constitutions, the four Elements gi∣ving to each a different Temper: <HI>Brammon</HI> ha∣ving participated of the Earth, was Melancholly; <HI>Kutterey</HI> being hot of Temper, had a Warlike Spi∣rit; <HI>Schuddery</HI> being of a cold moist Constitution, was of a meek Spirit; and <HI>Wyse</HI> being of an angry Disposition, had a quick Wit.</P>
<P>Moreover, God endu'd <HI>Brammon,</HI> according to his Nature, with Wisdom, and through him pub∣lish'd his Laws and Commandments; for he judg'd his reserv'd Life and serious Countenance most fit for that purpose: and therefore he gave him a Book, wherein was set down how he would be serv'd; and which also treated of other things con∣cerning Religion.</P>
<P>God also, according to the Constitution of <HI>Kut∣terey,</HI> gave him Power to rule Kingdoms, with a Scepter to keep the People in awe, and make the Commonalty work and labor for the Publick Good: And as a sign of this Power, God gave him a Sword in his Hand, the proper Instrument of his Victory and Dominion.</P>
<P><HI>Schuddery,</HI> according to his natural Inclinations, God judg'd fit for Traffick, whereby he might fur∣nish all parts of the Earth with such things as they stood in need of, by means of Navigation: and as a Token of what he was appointed for, as also to mind him of his Employment, God gave him a pair of Scales, with a Bag full of all sorts of Weights, as proper Instruments of his Calling.</P>
<P><HI>Wyse,</HI> according to his Disposition, God endu'd with a Genius of inventing all manner of Mecha∣nical Arts, giving him a Bag full of Tools and In∣struments, for the working of such things withal as his Fancy should direct.</P>
<P>The World being thus far compleated, God gave not <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parkoutee</HI> any Daughters, lest Works, which hitherto he had preserv'd from all Uncleanness, might be defil'd by the incestuous Conjunction of the Brothers with the Sisters; wherefore God being willing to preserve the In∣nocence and Holiness of their first Parents, res∣olv'd to ordain such means for the propagating. Mankind, as might correspond with the Work of the Creation, by making four Women for the Sons of <HI>Pourous</HI> anst <HI>Parkoutee;</HI> whereof one was sent to the East, another to the West, a third to the North, and a fourth to the South, that being thus separated one from the other, the Propagation of Man kind might be the sooner compleated in all Parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>The eldest Son of the first Man call'd <HI>Brammon,</HI> became Great, being highly esteem'd by his other Brothers, as well for his Age as his great Merits, but especially for the Converse he often held with God, concerning Religion and the manner of Worship; wherein he instructed his Brethren, reading the Book which was given him by God, containing the Secrets and Manner of worship∣ping him, with great Care and Reverence, God revealing himself to him very often in Person.</P>
<P>And as God had created Man in a pleasant and delightful Place, situate in the Belly and Navel of the Earth, where the Sun makes no Shadow at Noon, so he resolv'd to send the Brothers which were come from the Centre of the World, to the Circumference thereof, to People it. Wherefore he commanded <HI>Brammon</HI> to take the Book wherein were written the Laws of God, and travel towards the rising of the Sun; who thereupon setting for∣ward the next Morning, after having travell'd se∣veral Miles, found himself near an high Mountain inclosing a pleasant Valley, which was water'd by a delightful Stream; on whose Banks appear'd a beautiful Woman, who came to quench her Thirst with the Waters; she, like <HI>Brammon,</HI> was stark na∣ked, which their Innocency made them ignorant of. This Woman having black Hair, was of an Olive colour, her Body well shap'd, of a middle Stature, sweet Countenance, and, like him, of a melancholy Disposition. She, surpriz'd at the sight of <HI>Brammon,</HI> was exceedingly amaz'd, not being able for a considerable time to speak a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> word, doubtful whether she had best run away, or stay and satisfie her Curiosity with the pleasantness of so strange and unusual an Object; whilst <HI>Brammon</HI> on his part was no less concern'd, fearing if she fled, he should lose the Presence of a Creature he so extremely admir'd; so that they both remain'd silent, entertaining mutual Passions and Affections the one for the other: At last, the Woman having in vain expected an Address from <HI>Brammon,</HI> ap∣ply'd her self to him, demanding the reason that mov'd him to come thither? who answer'd, That it was in obedience to the Command of Him who made the World, and created her and him, toge∣ther with all visible things, as also that Light which afforded them the Pleasure of beholding each other. The Woman, whom God had endu'd a with Wisdom and Understanding, reply'd, That the resemblance which was between them, was an infallible sign that they were both made by one Hand, and that the Creator who had ordain'd all things for their Welfare, had certainly appointed their meeting there, that by a nearer Obligation they might for the future be joyn'd together; when casting her Eyes on the Book which <HI>Brammon</HI> held in his Hand, she ask'd what it was? who in few words discovering to her the Contents thereof, she requested he would sit down by her, and in∣struct her in his Religion; which he willingly granted: when judging that their Meeting was decreed by God, they consulted the Book, resol∣ving to unite themselves by a Matrimonial Vow:
<PB N="226" REF="165"/>in order whereto, performing the Ceremonies usual between Man and Wife, they liv'd in per∣fect Unity, and so encreas'd the World, that the Off-spring of this <HI>Bramman</HI> and <HI>Savatree</HI> (for such was the Name of the Woman) Peopled all the Eastern Parts of the Universe.</P>
<P>God also commanded <HI>Kuttery,</HI> second Son of <HI>Pou∣rus,</HI> to direct his Course Westward, in order to the Peopling that part of the World: Who imme∣diately taking his Sword which God had given him as an Instrument to Conquer withal, thought on nothing more than a Conveniency to exercise Valor.</P>
<P>During his Journey, turning his Back every Morning toward the Rising Sun, to his great amazement he saw the same every Evening, after having finish'd his Journey, a vast way before him. Thus Travelling towards the West, he continual∣ly look'd about him, expecting some Adventure would present it self, and wishing to meet with whole Regiments of Armed Men, or Herds of Wild Beasts; when nothing appearing, and con∣sidering on what account God sent him thither, full of Heroick Passion, he could not refrain thus to expostulate: <HI>For what reason has God given me Strength, since he denies me an Opportunity to mani∣fest the same, and acquire Honor thereby!</HI> Howbe∣it he Travell'd yet farther Westward, in hopes of meeting an Adventure befitting his Quality, and resolving to expose whatever he should meet, to the Fury of his Rage: When coming to a Moun∣tain whose Summit yielded a delightful Prospect over all the adjacent Country, he perceiv'd a well∣shap'd Creature make towards him, of a Disposi∣tion and Countenance sutable to his, wherewith he was exceedingly pleas'd; when coming neer together, with an intention of trying each others Valor, he perceiv'd it was a Woman; her Hair dishevell'd hung dangling over her Shoulders, holding in her Hands a <HI>Chucherey,</HI> which being a round sharp Weapon, hath a Hole in the middle, through which passes a Rope, whose end being held fast in the Hand, does great Execution at a considerable distance, when thrown at an Enemy: Which he perceiving, immediately believ'd her Valiant; for her enrag'd Countenance was a suf∣ficient Testimony of the earnest desire she had to Conquer and Triumph over her Enemies. After their first Assault, <HI>Toddikastre</HI> (so the Woman was call'd) using her <HI>Chucherey</HI> with great dexterity, soon made <HI>Kuttery</HI> sensible of her high displeasure, manifesting a greater desire of conquering him with her Arms than with her Beauty; whereby this first day of their Meeting was spent in Blows and Wounds interchangeably given; she with her <HI>Chuchery,</HI> and he with his Sword, scarce allowing each other respite to breathe, continuing the Com∣bate till the dark Night's approach forc'd a Ces∣sation, when neither could boast of any Advan∣tage gain'd upon the other.</P>
<P>The next Morning, so soon as the Sun began to dart out his Resplendent Rays, they renew'd their Combat with fresh Courage and Eagerness, re∣solving to revenge the Injuries they had receiv'd the day before: Long was the Fight, and doubt∣ful, when <HI>Kuttery</HI> getting some Advantage, cut her <HI>Chuchery</HI> asunder with his Sword; but it growing dark, <HI>Toddikastre</HI> vanish'd from <HI>Kuttery,</HI> thereby gaining time to supply her self with a Bow and Arrows, and gather new Force to engage an Ene∣my that had endeavor'd to kill her.</P>
<P>The third Morning they renew'd the Fight again, entertaining alike hopes of ending the Bat∣tel speedily, and subduing each other; when she observing her Enemy within reach of her Bow, approach'd with great Courage: Which <HI>Kuttery</HI> perceiving, and knowing his Sword would signifie little against a VVeapon that could command at so great a distance, resolv'd to engage her Hand to Hand; when each of them gave such ample Te∣stimonies of their Valor, and so wearied them∣selves, that they remain'd equally Conquerors and Conquer'd. Thus the Fight having been maintain'd on equal Terms, and the Advantage not determinable, they disputed the Victory with their Tongues, since it could not be decided by their VVeapons: For <HI>Kuttery</HI> holding <HI>Toddikastre</HI> by the Hair, and endeavoring to make her submit, was extremely struck with admiration when she appear'd to him much more Beautiful than before, as if this Exercise had serv'd only to encrease her Beauty, and render her more amiable; which ob∣lig'd him to direct the following Discourse to her.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore, O Wonder of all Living Creatures, as well for Valor as Beauty, has Fury and Rage thus transported us one against the other? If I had be∣reav'd you of Life in this Conflict, I should have curs'd my Right Hand for being the Instrument of de∣stroying so Incomparable a Creature; whereas if you had kill'd me, you could not but have been perpetually troubled in Mind, having bereft your self of the Pleasures, Enjoyments, and Satisfaction you may pos∣sibly have in my Company: Why then should a Person of such Excellency seek the Ruin of another, which ob∣tain'd, would not in the least add to your Lustre. Hath God given us Understanding and Courage to destroy one another, especially we that ought to be preserv'd? Certainly your Valor will not be abated, when I shall declare unto you my Condition, and divide my Strength and Power with you; nay rather, being Friends, we shall be capacitated for the Undertaking the greatest Enterprizes whatsoever, and valiantly revenge all In∣juries that shall be offer'd us. Know then, That the World is yet but like a young Child, having far great∣er need of being replenish'd with People, than bereft of them by force of Arms. Love and Nature teach us to study our own Preservation, which may better be accomplish'd by being at Union, than at Variance one with another. Let us not therefore endeavor by force∣able and unlawful Means to seek a Glory which may prove Mortal to both; but let us rather study to settle a happy and everlasting Peace between us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Toddikastre</HI> having with great attention heark∣ned unto a Proposal grounded on so much Reason, after a little silence reply'd, <HI>That notwithstanding she plainly discover'd sufficient marks of his Rage and Fury, which might provoke her to Revenge, yet she submitted to his Argument, readily and freely con∣senting to his Proposal of Peace.</HI> VVhereupon gi∣ving each other their Hands, to confirm their new Friendship, they, of mortal Enemies, became the greatest Friends in Nature; and resolving to live and die together, begat many Children, pro∣ducing a Race of Valiant and Heroick Spirits: And thus was the VVestern Part of the World Peopled by these two Generous Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Shuddery</HI> the third Son of <HI>Pourous</HI> was sent Northward to Traffique as a Merchant, taking with him his Weights and a Pair of Scales, wherewith to weigh whatever was bought or sold. Having travell'd a considerable way, wishing to meet with an Adventure sutable to his Calling, he came at last to a Mountain call'd <HI>Challa,</HI> when be∣ginning to Rain very hard, he was necessitated to
<PB N="227" REF="165"/>seek for shelter in a small Cave which was in the said Mountain. The Rain ceasing, the Sky be∣gan to clear up; but the Water having cover'd most of the Ways, kept <HI>Shuddery</HI> from Travelling that day: But no sooner had the thirsty Earth drunk up the Water, and the Sun dry'd up the re∣maining Moisture, when in order to proceed on his Journey he leaves the Cave, and scarcely ar∣riv'd at the bottom of the Valley, but he found se∣veral Shells, which out of Curiosity opening, he concluded by their Brightness and Beauty that they ought carefully to be preserv'd, though alto∣gether ignorant of the Value; so putting them up very safe, he went on, and having scarce pass'd through the Valley, he found himself near ano∣ther Mountain, upon which appear'd a Rock of Diamonds, wich having been wash'd by the great Rain, appear'd very glorious and sparkling, cau∣sing a great admiration in <HI>Shuddery,</HI> who judg'd it to have been a great Fire. Passing on, and per∣ceiving the suppos'd Fire did not spread it self, yet encreas'd in Lustre, he was curious to be satisfied what it might be, by touching the same with his Finger, whereby he perceiv'd that though these glittering Diamonds sparkled like Fire, yet they had not that Heat with them; wherefore he re∣solv'd to expect the next Morning, to see if he could make any further Discovery of this great Mystery: But the Day caus'd a far greater altera∣tion than he expected, which no sooner appear'd, but the Light of the Diamonds vanish'd, nothing remaining but a Rock of whitish Stones, of which he took as many as he could carry, carefully ob∣serving the Place against his Return, in case he should be better inform'd of the Value. Whence proceeding, he at last espy'd the Nymph that was ordain'd for him, walking by the side of the Wood which border'd on the Plain he was crossing: He directed his Course towards the Object which at that distance appear'd to him most pleasing and beautiful. The Nymph was not a little surpris'd at the sight of him, remaining in suspence whe∣ther to fly or stay, till <HI>Shuddery</HI> approaching near her, thus express'd himself.</P>
<P><HI>Most admirable and beautiful Creature, so nearly resembling me, I beg your Company, not onely for the likeness between us, to our mutual admiration, which I hope may oblige you to love me, and entertain a good Opinion of one that follows you with no bad Intent; but that I may be happy in your Conversation, since the Similitude between us seems to challenge a more inti∣mate Familiarity. Visagondah</HI> (for such was her Name) express'd by her silence the pleasure she took in <HI>Shuddery</HI>'s Presence, no way distrusting her Safety; at last she demanded of him <HI>how it came to pass that two Persons, having never seen one another before, could so perfectly understand each others Lan∣guage.</HI> To which <HI>Shuddery</HI> reply'd, <HI>That God who had given their Bodies a like Shape, had also endued them with one Tongue, thereby to assist and discover their Secrets one to another.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus shew'd great Testimonies of Friendship to one another, staying some time in the Place, <HI>Shuddery</HI> related to her his Adven∣tures; after which, living many Years together, they begat divers Children, which grown up be∣came Merchants, with whom <HI>Shuddery</HI> work'd in the Diamond-Rock he had discover'd, laying up great Quantities thereof, and prizing them at a high Value, made them so esteem'd of through the whole World. And from the Issue of this <HI>Shuddery</HI> (according to the Tradition of the <HI>Indians</HI>) the Northern Parts of the World were Peopled.</P>
<P><HI>Wyse,</HI> the youngest of the four Brothers, took his Journey towards the South, taking with him the most useful Instruments which he had invent∣ed for the Benefit of Mankind; for God had en∣du'd him with far more Understanding than any of his Brothers: He was the Inventor of all Arts, and taught his Children to Build Houses, Towns, and Castles, to Till the Groud, and all other things necessary to Humane Life; for which rea∣son he was call'd <HI>Viskarmah,</HI> that is, <HI>A Vertuoso,</HI> because nothing was difficult to him that could be done.</P>
<P>Being endu'd with this great Knowledge and Skill in Husbandry and Building, God order'd him to Travel Southward, where in his way he pass'd by seven great Lakes, leaving at each of them Marks of his Ingenuity; and having pass'd the last, he found himself in a Country call'd <HI>Derpe,</HI> where he built a fair House near the Lake, with many Apartments, and a flat Roof. Here he staid some time alone to refresh himself; but he had not long enjoy'd the sweetness of his Re∣pose, when he was disturb'd by a strange Acci∣dent: The Woman which was appointed for him, passing by a neighboring Wood near the side of the Lake, stood still to admire the Magnificent Form of the new-built Structure, which she ap∣proach'd to view more narrowly, having never be∣fore seen the like.</P>
<P><HI>Wyse</HI> espying her so earnestly view his Habita∣tion, found himself struck with admiration at the sight of so surprising a Creature, her Body being perfectly White, and her Hair resembling the Colour of Gold; wherefore he approach'd nearer the Person who at a distance had wrought a very great alteration in him: whilst she was not a little abash'd to see him come so near her, and ask'd the Reason of his coming to disturb her in a Place where she us'd always to be alone. Whereupon <HI>Wyse</HI> replying, said, <HI>God the Maker of Light, who hath created all things visible, hath sent me hither to behold and admire your Beauty, which is so excellent, that it ought not to be kept secret; for God hath crea∣ted you to be seen, and to testifie the wondrous Works of his Hands. And to enjoy your presence I have tra∣vell'd through many Dangers, often adventuring my Life in the search of you; and therefore I hope my Love will meet with a sutable Return.</HI> Lastly, <HI>he de∣sir'd her to afford him the enjoyment of her Company, and to look upon him as the onely Comfort sent by God in her solitary Life.</HI> But she resolving not to change her manner of Life, reply'd, <HI>That during his Absence she could no way perceive that his Presence could be any Advantage to her; nor at that instant, whilst he was talking with her, she could not find her self any ways inclined to receive his Proffers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wyse</HI> fearing to lose her Presence, being desirous of a longer enjoyment of her Company, requested her to walk into his House, and to view the seve∣ral Apartments thereof, hoping when she had seen the wonderful Work of his Hands, she would have a greater Respect for him: But his Civility seem'd rather troublesom to her, telling him, <HI>That if he would not let her depart freely, he would highly incur her displeasure, and force her to vow never to see him more.</HI> Whereupon going from him, she gave him sufficient Testimonies of her Displeasure, and that she was not to be compell'd to do any thing by force. This reduc'd <HI>Wyse</HI> almost into Despair, who durst not by any means prevent her going away, but was compell'd to suffer himself to be
<PB N="228" REF="166"/>bereav'd of all those Enjoyments he was possest of during her stay; and having spent the follow∣ing Night in condoling his Misfortune in the loss of the Person he esteem'd above his own Life, he at break of day concluded to use all possible dili∣gence to find her again; and crossing the neighbor Places backward and forward, he at last came into a Valley, where he spy'd her picking of Flowers, and accosting her, began as follows.</P>
<P><HI>O most Beautiful Creature, much more sweet and excellent than all the Flowers this Earth produces, the Love which I bear to you forces me a second time to view your most incomparable Beauty, and to implore a Return of your Affections. Oh fly not, since you have have had sufficient Testimonies of the reality of my Af∣fections.</HI> He seeing that these words had pre∣vail'd with her to stay, began to discourse with her concerning the Creation of the World, and in∣form her of what Parents he was extracted, and after what manner his Brothers were sent into se∣veral Parts of the Earth: And after many other remarkable Passages, he told her, he could not be∣lieve that God would have permitted him to Tra∣vel over seven Seas, and undergo so many Dan∣gers, had not his Resolutions been to sweeten the toilsomness of his Lahors and Troubles by the hap∣py Enjoyment of her Company. She not de∣lighting in his Discourse, desir'd him to entertain some other things in his Thoughts; and if he could give her no greater Testimonies of his Affe∣ction, to leave her alone, and not trouble her more with any such Discourse: And so they parted.</P>
<P><HI>Wyse</HI> thus depriv'd of all his Enjoyments and Happiness, being extremely perplex'd in Mind, went into a solitary Place, where falling down on his Knees, in a doleful Tone he utter'd these words.</P>
<P><HI>O Lord, to whom only belongs the Knowledge of my Being, thou knowst that in obedience to thy Commands I have forsaken the Company of my Parents, and also that of my Brothers, and perhaps I shall never see them more: Thou also knowest that I have endur'd great hardship during the time of my Travels, and deserted all Company, to range up and down the World alone: But that which most perplexes me, is the sight of a Per∣son, who, in stead of comforting me with her Presence and Conversation, adds to my Grief, by denying me her Company. O Lord, do not reward all my Troubles so ill, and destroy not all those good Parts thou hast given me, by this great Misfortune. And you blue Heavens, and green Trees, under which I kneel, be Witnesses of my Misfortune; and therefore, O thou Creator of all things, if thou hast the least kindness for thy Creature, give me, I beseech thee, a sign there∣of, by comforting me in this unsufferable Affliction under which thy Servant groans.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner had he ended his Prayers, but a sweet Brieze of Wind came rushing through the Leaves of the Trees, which was follow'd by a Voice, saying, <HI>What are thy Demands, O Son of Pourous?</HI> To which he answer'd, <HI>That I may enjoy the Woman whose Face I so lately beheld, and that we may be united by the inseparable Bond of Matrimony, that so I may enjoy the sweetness of her Company till the Hour of my Death.</HI> This was immediately granted him, upon condition that he should build <HI>Pagods</HI> or Temples under the Shades of Trees, there to serve God, and worship the Images, be∣cause God had heard his Prayer. Immediately after <HI>Jejunogundah</HI> (for so the Woman was call'd) finding her self inclin'd to love <HI>Wyse,</HI> went and gave him Testimony of her Affections, granting him all his Wishes; so that from that time for∣ward living quiet in the mutual Enjoyment of each other, they begat many Children: By which means the Southern, as well as the other Parts of he World, came to be Peopled.</P>
<P>Lastly, These four Brethren, after having thus Peopled the World, resolv'd to return again to the Place where they first receiv'd Life. <HI>Bram∣mon</HI> was the first who with his Extract, after ha∣ving Planted the East, resolv'd to go and end the remaining part of his Days in the Place where he was born, and there to instruct his People in the true Worship of God, to the end there might be onely one way of Serving God throughout the whole VVorld, which otherwise might breed a great distraction among the People.</P>
<P><HI>Kuttery,</HI> who was the second Brother, and the first who had compleated his Journey after <HI>Bram∣mon,</HI> and perform'd all things he was design'd for, had also an Inclination to see his Native Country, to acquaint his Parents and Brothers with the Blessing that God had bestow'd upon him, in a VVife and so many Children; and also to relate to them the Adventures he had met withal during his absence.</P>
<P>The same Reasons mov'd <HI>Shuddery</HI> and <HI>Wyse</HI> to Travel to their Native Country. Moreover, God, who would not frustrate their Designs by any ill Accidents that otherwise might have hap∣ned, suffer'd them all safely to meet at one Place, after every one of them had perform'd those Offi∣ces which were enjoyn'd them, to the great Satis∣faction and Joy of their Parents and themselves; and began, like Men remov'd to a new Plantation, to propagate their Generations at home also, to the end the World might be fully Peopled in all Parts, spending their time in teaching their Peo∣ple several Arts. <HI>Brammon</HI> instructed them in Religion, <HI>Kuttery</HI> in Matters of State, <HI>Shuddery</HI> in Merchandise, and <HI>Wyse</HI> in Mechanicks: So that at this time the VVorld consisted of these four sorts of People, each Tribe living apart, accord∣ing to their Office, for avoiding all Confusions and Disorders: And thus the VVorld was Plant∣ed in each Part, and all thing were for a time in good Order. But their Joy did not long continue, they having no sooner tasted the sweetness of it, than it vanish'd; for as <HI>Multitude is the Mother of Confusion,</HI> and occasions much Mischief, and many Evils happen where the People are numer∣ous and careless, and Negligence reigns chiefly in prosperous Times; so by the Sensuality of these four Brethren forgetting all thoughts of their present and former Happiness, all things began to run into miserable Confusion, because the People were too much enclin'd to Voluptuous∣ness and Ease; <HI>Brammon</HI> neglecting his Duty and Religion, and Service of God: <HI>Kuttery</HI> became a Tyrant: <HI>Shuddery</HI> falsified his VVeights and Ba∣lance, and practis'd all manner of Knavery to de∣fraud his Brothers: <HI>Wyse</HI> grew unconscionable, employing the Benefits which arose from his In∣ventions in Profuseness. Thus each of them de∣rogating from their first Principles, grew malici∣ous to each other; <HI>Brammon</HI> not being able to di∣spense with the Insolence of his Brother <HI>Kuttery,</HI> who on the other side refus'd to shew Reverence to <HI>Brammon,</HI> which he was oblig'd to, as being his elder Brother; moreover, he was very cruel, and took delght in putting to death those he dis∣lik'd, forc'd <HI>Shuddery</HI> to pay Tribute to him, and reap'd the benefit of <HI>Wyse</HI>'s Lahor. These bad
<PB N="229" REF="166"/>Examples were the first Seeds of Wickedness, which encreas'd to a greater height amongst their Successors, and made a breach of the sweet Uni∣on which reign'd at that time in the first Age of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Wyse</HI> seeing <HI>Brammon</HI> love his Credit and Re∣spect which was due to him, concluded to make him yet more miserable, by instituting a new man∣ner of Religion in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> The Wor∣shipping or Images, which he was commanded by a Vision; hereupon he built <HI>Pagods</HI> under the Shades of Trees, ordaining many new Ceremo∣nies: But because there was no mention made of them in the Books of <HI>Brammon,</HI> great Disputes were held for a long time to know whether they should be receiv'd or not; but after <HI>Wyse</HI> had con∣firm'd that he had receiv'd them from the Mouth of God, they were adjudg'd Lawful. Moreover, they inventing new and wicked Designs daily, and thereby encreasing their Sins, God was displeas'd thereat, the Heavens were cover'd with Horror and Darkness, the Sea swell'd with Anger, as if it would unite with the Clouds to ruin the Peo∣ple; a great Noise was heard in the Air, Thunder and Lightning arose from the Center of the Earth, as if it threatned to purge the World from its Filthiness by a total Destruction: For soon after hapned a great Deluge, which swal∣low'd up all the Inhabitants of the Earth, where∣by their Bodies were punish'd for their Sins, yet their Souls were entertain'd in the Almighties Bo∣som.</P>
<P>In this manner, according to the Opinion of the <HI>Benjans,</HI> ended the first Age of the World; and they further add, That God shew'd his Power in destroying the Creatures he had made, which perhaps else would never have been known; yet he Created a new World and People, which were all Clean, and deserving of his Wisdom and Mercy: And because the first Age of the World was thus destroy'd by the wickedness of the Peo∣ple, he resolv'd by means of three more perfect Persons than the first, call'd <HI>Bremaw, Wistney,</HI> and <HI>Rudderey,</HI> to make a second; and in order there∣unto, God leaving the Heavens, descended upon a great Mountain call'd <HI>Meropurbattee,</HI> from the top of which he utter'd these words; <HI>Rise up</HI> Bremaw, <HI>the first of Living Creatures of the second Age:</HI> Whereupon the Earth opening, <HI>Bremaw</HI> started up out of the Bowels thereof, and at the same instant knew his Creator, and Worshipp'd him: after which, God by a second and third Command caus'd <HI>Wistney</HI> and <HI>Rudderey</HI> also to arise and wor∣ship him. But as God does nothing without seri∣ous Consideration, and appoints all things to a certain end, so likewise he did not create these three Persons to live alone in Idleness, but to re∣people the World, and gave to <HI>Bremaw,</HI> who was the first, the Power of making new Creatures; for (say the <HI>Benjans</HI>) as Princes do not Officiate their Affairs but by Agents, so did it not stand with God's Greatness to humble himself to make his own Creatures, as long as he was able to do it by means of his Servants.</P>
<P>To <HI>Wistney,</HI> who was the second, he gave the Charge of taking Care to preserve those Crea∣tures which as he had commanded through his Mercy to be made, so it did likewise beseem his Wisdom to see them preserv'd: Yet to <HI>Rudderey,</HI> who was the third, he give Power to destroy them; for he foresaw that they would grow wic∣ked, and deserving of Punishment.</P>
<P>And as God had given the Power to these three Persons to make such wonderful Creatures, he was also oblig'd to give them a means whereby they might be able to perform their several Offices. <HI>Bremaw</HI> therefore had the Power to Create and Produce such Creatures as he thought most fit: And to the end <HI>Wistney</HI> might be able to preserve them, God gave him a full Power over all things which might tend to their Preservation, making him Lord of the Sun and Moon, Clouds, Rain, and the Dew which falls on the Earth, as also of Hills and Valleys, leaving it to his discretion to appoint the several Seasons of the Year, and gi∣ving him Power of bestowing Riches, Health, and Honor on whom he pleas'd; in a word, he made him Master of all things which tend to the wel∣fare and support of Humane Creatures. And to the end <HI>Ruddery</HI> might be the onely Instrument to execute God's Justice, God gave him Power over all things which might occasion the Ruin of Li∣ving Creatures, giving him Power to chastize Sinners with Sickness, Poverty, War, Pestilence, and Death.</P>
<P>After their several Offices were prescrib'd to these three Persons, a certain time was limited them to live upon the Earth: And because the Work of the Creation, which belong'd to <HI>Bre∣maw,</HI> was perfected in the second Age, he deser∣vedly at the end thereof was taken up into Hea∣ven, to dwell with the Almighty. Furthermore, since the other Age was to be Peopled by those which were preserv'd from the General Destructi∣on of the World, <HI>Wistney</HI> staid twice as long on the Earth as his Brother <HI>Bremaw,</HI> because there was a longer time requir'd for their farther Preser∣vation. And because the World was to be ended by a general Ruin and Destruction, therefore <HI>Rud∣dery</HI> was to stay three times longer on the Earth than <HI>Wistney,</HI> to the end that when the great day of Judgement should come, he should destroy all Creatures, and carry their Souls with him into a Place of Glory.</P>
<P>Moreover, when they had all things granted them, wanting nothing but to put in execution those Commandments which God had laid upon them, <HI>Bremaw</HI> began seriously to consider with himself after what manner he might behave him∣self most honourably in the Employment that God had put him upon; when on a sudden he felt a strange alteration in his Body, accompanied with a general Pain through all his Parts, such as that with a Woman in her Travel, foretelling some strange and wonderful Event; his Body was in an instant swell'd after a strange manner, and his Intrails grew sensibly bigger than before: At last his Body open'd in two Places, <HI>viz.</HI> on his Right and Left Side, out of which came two Twins, the one a Male, the other a Female, both of their full growth.</P>
<P><HI>Bremaw</HI> having receiv'd Strength again, instru∣cted them in things concerning Religion, and call'd the Man <HI>Manow,</HI> and the Woman <HI>Ceteroupa,</HI> who after they had worshipp'd God, thank'd <HI>Bre∣maw</HI> that brought them into the VVorld; and ha∣ving receiv'd his Blessing; they travell'd towards the East, setling on a Mountain call'd <HI>Munderpur∣vool,</HI> to the end that those which they should be∣get might spread themselves East, West, North, and South. No sooner were they come to the foremention'd Mountain, but <HI>Ceteroupa</HI> was deli∣ver'd of three Sons and three Daughters, whereof the eldest Son was call'd <HI>Priauretta,</HI> the second
<PB N="230" REF="167"/><HI>Outanapautha,</HI> the third <HI>Scomeraut;</HI> the eldest Daughter was nam'd <HI>Kammah,</HI> the second <HI>Soone∣retaw,</HI> and the third <HI>Sumboo.</HI> As soon as they came to Age, they were sent to several Places, <HI>Priauretta</HI> and <HI>Kammah</HI> to the West, to a Moun∣tain call'd <HI>Segund; Otanapautha</HI> and <HI>Soonurettaw</HI> to the North, to the Mountain <HI>Ripola; Someraut</HI> and <HI>Sumboo</HI> to the South, to the Mountain <HI>Supars;</HI> all which Countries they made very populous. By this means <HI>Bremaw</HI> was the first Father of all the Inhabitants of the Earth, whilst <HI>Wistney</HI> took care for all necessary things for the preservation of hu∣mane Creatures which <HI>Bremaw</HI> had made, by af∣fording them all the Blessings that make Men hap∣py in this Life, till at last <HI>Ruddery</HI> sent Sickness, Death, and a Curse among the Children of Men, who by their wicked Lives had justly merited God's Vengeance.</P>
<P>This was the manner of Government which God us'd for the restoring of the World, and all humane Creatures which were to inhabit in the second Age.</P>
<P>Furthermore, God (according to the Relation of the <HI>Benjans</HI>) taught Men to serve him after this manner.</P>
<P>When God saw that there could be no Order nor lawful Government in those Places where his Worship and Service was not Establish'd, he resolv'd to make Laws for the preventing of Man's committing those Crimes which were the destruction of the first Age: In order whereunto he descended upon the Mountain <HI>Meropurbatee;</HI> to which Place he call'd <HI>Bremaw,</HI> to whom he ap∣pear'd in his Glory through a dark and thick Cloud, telling him, <Q>That he was necessitated to destroy the first Age, by reason Men would not obey his Commands, which were contain'd in the Book he had given to <HI>Brammon.</HI></Q> At the same time God gave <HI>Bremaw</HI> another Book, and commanded him to teach all things that were con∣tain'd therein. <HI>Bremaw</HI> to Execute his Office, pub∣lish'd God's Commandments to all People on the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Benjans</HI> call this Book <HI>Shaster,</HI> that is, <HI>The Book of Written Words,</HI> which contains three Trea∣tises or Parts; the first whereof contains their Fundamental Laws, with an Explanation of each Commandment. The second treats of the Cere∣monial Law, and teaches them the Ceremonies which are to be observ'd in their Religion. The third Treatise distinguishes all Men into certain Families or Tribes, and comprehends the Com∣mandments of each Tribe in particular, which is all that is contain'd in the Book <HI>Shaster;</HI> out of which we will here set down the chief Heads thereof. The first Treatise, in which is describ'd the Fundamental Laws which <HI>Bremaw</HI> taught, contain'd the following eight.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Thou shalt not kill any Creature that hath Life in it, for thou art one of the Creatures, and so is that; thou art endu'd with a Soul as that is, therefore thou shalt not take away the Life of any thing whatsoever it be, which belongs to me.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Thou shalt make a Contract with the five Senses; First with thy Eyes, that they may not see any thing that is ill. Secondly, with your Ears, that they may not hearken to any bad thing. Thirdly, with your Tongue. not to express any ill words. Fourthly, with your Pallat, that you taste nothing unclean, as Wine or the Flesh of living Creatures. Lastly, with your Hands, that they may not touch any thing to defile them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Thou shalt exactly observe and keep all the Days and Times appointed for Devotion, as likewise Clean∣sing, with Worshipping and Praying, which thou must perform with an upright and zealous Heart.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Thou shalt not give any false Testimonies, or speak Lies, by means of which thou mightest defraud thy Brother, and enrich thy self by fraudulent means, when thou Tradest with him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Thou shalt be merciful to the Poor according to thy Power, and assist them in their Necessities with Meat, Wood, and other things they may stand in need of for their support.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Thou shalt not oppress the Poor, and serve thy self with that Power which is given thee, to destroy thy Brother unjustly.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Thou shalt keep certain Feasts and Holidays with∣out pampering thy Body, and feeding thy self with La∣civiousness, but on the contrary, spend certain Days in Fasting; and in stead of Sleeping over much, Watch often, to be the better prepar'd for Praying, and for the performance of all other Holy Offices.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. <HI>Thou shalt not take any thing from thy Brother, whatever it be, wherewith thou art entrusted, but con∣tent thy self with what he shall give thee for thy Reward, remembring thou hast no Right to that which belongs to another.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These eight Commandments are prescrib'd to all the four Tribes in general; but besides them they have two more, which are particular to each Tribe.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Bramines</HI> and <HI>Schuddery,</HI> that is the Priests and Merchants, are strictly oblig'd to observe their Religious Commandments, and have near Relati∣on one to another in Matters of Religion, as there is between those of <HI>Kuttery</HI> and <HI>Wyse,</HI> that is the Magistrates and Handicrafts. They ascribe to the <HI>Bramines,</HI> which are the Priests, the first and second Commandments, because they place the chief of their Religion in these two things; first to prevent the killing of living Creatures, and next to abstain from all forbidden things, as eating of Flesh, drinking of Wine, and the like; which the <HI>Kutteries</HI> and <HI>Benjans</HI> are also strictly to observe.</P>
<P>They attribute particularly the third and fourth Commandments to <HI>Schuddery,</HI> as being very suita∣ble to his Office, because it may possess the Peo∣ple with Devotion, and prevent those fraudulent Practises which are common among Traders.</P>
<P>To <HI>Kuttery</HI> they prescribe (being the Governors or Magistrates) the fifth and sixth Command∣ments, because they admonish the People of Love and Compassion to the Poor, well knowing that Oppression is a common Sin among those that are in Power.</P>
<P>They prescribe to <HI>Wys,</HI> or the Handicrafts, the seventh and eighth Commandments, because those kind of People require some Days for Re∣creation. They are also forbidden to Steal, to which they have great temptations and opportu∣nities, when they go to work in other Persons Houses. Lastly, notwithstanding they are oblig'd to obey all their Commandments in general, yet every Tribe observes those two which are pre∣scrib'd them, with more Zeal than any of the rest.</P>
<P>The second Treatise of the Book given to <HI>Bre∣maw,</HI> contain'd the usual Ceremonial Institutions to be observ'd on certain Occasions, <HI>viz.</HI> the often washing of their Bodies, and anointing them with certain red Salve, the making of Offerings and Prayers, and the manner of Marrying aad Bury∣ing: Notwithstanding all which things are be∣fore declar'd at large, yet it will be requisite to
<PB N="231" REF="167"/>give you an account of them, as <HI>Henry Lord</HI> Trans∣lated them out of their Book call'd <HI>Shaster,</HI> partly for their coherence in some things, and disagree∣ing in others.</P>
<P>First they are expresly commanded to wash their Bodies in a River, which as the <HI>Benjans</HI> re∣late, began in the second Age of the World, and ordain'd among other Religious Ceremonies, to mind them that the World was destroy'd once by Water for their Sins. This Ceremony is us'd af∣ter the following manner: First, they daub their Bodies all over with Mud or Dirt taken from the bottom of a River, to express thereby the natural Pollution of Man: This done, they go to the River with their Faces turn'd towards the Sun, whilst the <HI>Bramine</HI> with a loud voice speaks these words:</P>
<P><HI>O Lord, this Man is foul and unclean like the Mud of this River, but as the Water is able to wash of this Filth, so we pray thee to cleanse him of his Sins.</HI></P>
<P>This Prayer being ended, they dive three times under Water; while they are washing themselves, the <HI>Bramine</HI> often calls upon the Name of the Ri∣ver, which is call'd <HI>Tappee,</HI> as also some other Streams in <HI>India,</HI> which are held in great Venera∣tion, because of their washing themselves therein: Among others that are thus accounted holy, are the Rivers <HI>Ganja</HI> and <HI>Narboda.</HI> Whilst the <HI>Bramine</HI> names these Rivers, he that washes himself throws a handful of Rice into the Priests Lap, as an Offer∣ing which they generally make to him. After which receiving an Absolution of all their sins, they depart.</P>
<P>Secondly, They make use of a certain red Salve or Ointment, with which they daub or anoint their Foreheads, where they stick certain Grains of Corn, signifying thereby, that God hath chosen and mark'd them as a People peculiar to him; but it serves only to preserve the memory of their Baptism: they anoint themselves several times a day, as often as they wash themselves. They utter several words, admonishing them of such things as they are commanded.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They are commanded to make Of∣ferings, and say certain Prayers under the green Trees; which Custom was Instituted by <HI>Wyse,</HI> to whom God appear'd under a green Tree, as we have already related, commanding him to per∣form his Devotion in such Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> call this Tree <HI>Lul;</HI> the <HI>Indians, Kasta;</HI> the <HI>Portuguese, Arbor de Raiz,</HI> that is, <HI>Root∣tree,</HI> because its Boughs shooting down into the Ground, take Root, and grow up anew, so that one Tree often spreads it self into a great circum∣ference, whereby several hundreds of Men may shade themselves under them, secure from the Heat of the Sun, and from Rain.</P>
<P>In one Place of this Country of <HI>Surratte,</HI> grows one of these Trees, from which the <HI>Indians</HI> dare not pluck a Leaf, fearing that they should that Year wherein they had so offended. The <HI>Fakiers,</HI> and other poor People, sleep under the same in the Night. They believe that great Sorrow will at∣tend those that offer any Injury to this Tree, breaking the least Bough from it; under which when they meet, each Man brings his Offerings along with him. There they anoint their Bodies with several Ointments, and pour forth their Prayers, the number of which they express by the ringing of a Bell; and in their Prayers they crave Health, Riches, and good success in all their Undertakings. They often meet here in great numbers, and keep great Feasts. They also build under these: Trees <HI>Pagods</HI> or Temples to their Idols, to which they shew great Reverence.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They are oblig'd to say several Pray∣ers in their Temples, which would have a greater similitude with the ordinary Worship, were they freed from certain superstitious Ceremonies to which they are oblig'd. These their Prayers chief∣ly consist in often calling upon the Name of God, and extolling his glorious Works. They also go in Processions, whilst their Priests sing certain Prayers at the ringing of Bells; and also making Offerings to their Images, and many such like ri∣diculous Ceremonies.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They are oblig'd to go to remote Streams, as to the <HI>Ganga,</HI> there to make Offerings, and to wash their Bodies; which to perform, thou∣sands go thither every Year, carrying with them great quantities of Precious Stones, and other Riches, which they throw into the same. They account those Saints, who at their Departure have their Mouths fill'd with the Water of this <HI>Ganga,</HI> or the Roof of their Mouths only moistned with the same.</P>
<P>Sixthly, They have another sort of Worship, which consists in calling upon their Saints, to whom they ascribe the Power of effecting and prospering all their Undertakings: Therefore those that desire to be happy in the State of Matri∣mony, call upon <HI>Hurmount;</HI> those that go about Building, Pray to <HI>Gunnes;</HI> in Sickness they call upon <HI>Vegenaut;</HI> the Soldiers which desire to be Victors, appeal to <HI>Bimohem;</HI> the poor and decre∣pit, to <HI>Syer;</HI> and those which live happily, im∣plore <HI>Nykasser.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly, They are oblig'd by virtue of the Law, to worship God as soon as any of his Crea∣tures appears to them after Sun-rising. This Reli∣gious Ceremony and Sign of their Devotion, they generally shew to the Sun and Moon, which they call the two Eyes of God. They also respect cer∣tain Beasts, which they account more clean than others, as Goats and Buffalo's, to which they as∣cribe such innocency and goodness, that they rub the Floors of their Chambers with the Dung of these Beasts, fancying that thereby they are made Holy.</P>
<P>Lastly, It is to be observ'd, that the manner of Baptizing and giving of Names to their Chil∣dren, is not one and the same with the Tribe of the <HI>Bramines;</HI> as with all the rest, who only wash their Children with Water, and afterwards one of their Relations taking a Pen, seemingly writes upon the Babes Forehead, and saith this short Prayer, <HI>Lord, do thou write good things on this Childs Fore∣head;</HI> whereupon all those that are present cry, <HI>We wish this may he effected:</HI> which done, they name the Child, and anoint its Temples with red Salve, to the end every one may know it is re∣ceiv'd into the Church, and mark'd for one of the Children of God; thus ending their Ceremony.</P>
<P>But the Children of the <HI>Bramines</HI> are not only wash'd as the others, but anointed with Oyl, whilst the Priest utters the following words: <HI>O Lord, we present thee this Child, born of a holy Tribe, anointed with Oyl, and wash'd with Water.</HI> Besides, they use several other Ceremonies; after which they Pray, that the Child may be a zealous obser∣ver of the Lives of the <HI>Bramines,</HI> and set down ex∣actly the Hour and Minute of the Childs Birth, and observe under what Planet it is born, that so they may know whether it shall be happy or un∣happy,
<PB N="232" REF="168"/>keeping the Horoscope, not shewing it to any till the Day of his Marriage, which they ac∣count th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> happiest Day of his Life, and then pub∣lickly declare all the Dangers he has escap'd, and those which yet threaten him.</P>
<P>The third Treatise of the Book which was gi∣ven to <HI>Bremaw,</HI> describes after what manner they ought to live, what difference and dictinction they must observe in those things which are mention'd in their several Tribes.</P>
<P>They affirm, that there can be no better way found to Govern the World, than that which was us'd in the first Age, by means of four Tribes; that is to say, to have <HI>Bramines</HI> to Teach the Law of God to the People; <HI>Kutteries,</HI> to Govern and keep the People in Obedience to the Law; <HI>Schudderies,</HI> or Merchants, to Trade; and lastly, <HI>Wyses</HI> or Handicraft-men and Laborers, to supply others by their Labors with such Necessaries as are wanting. For this reason, by virtue of this third Treatise of the foremention'd Book, they are ob∣lig'd, in all their Tribes, as much as in them lies, to uphold this ancient manner of Governing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bramines</HI> is the first Tribe, and being lookt upon by the Commonalty as Priests, are of two sorts; first there are common <HI>Bramines,</HI> which are more in number in <HI>India</HI> than any other; secondly, particular <HI>Bramines,</HI> far lesser in number, and are by the <HI>Benjans</HI> call'd <HI>Verteas;</HI> by the Moors, <HI>Scu∣rahs.</HI> The common sort of <HI>Bramines</HI> consist of seventy two Families or Tribes, who are Go∣vern'd by so many eminent Men, who for their great Knowledge are highly esteem'd amongst them; they call them Soothsayers of such and such and such a Place where they reside. The chiefest of them bears the Name of <HI>Vikalnagra∣nauger,</HI> that is, <HI>Soothsayer of Vikalnagra,</HI> a City so call'd. Likewise the next are denominated from the Places of their Abode; by which means the seventy two Tribes are distinguish'd.</P>
<P>What concerns the Offices or Employments, of these <HI>Bramines,</HI> is already related at large.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the peculiar <HI>Bramines,</HI> they are call'd <HI>Verteas,</HI> and are generally Persons of the Tribe of <HI>Schuddery,</HI> or Merchants, and are a Peo∣ple who out of Zeal take upon them this Religi∣ous Office. They go Habited in white Woollen Cloth, which comes down to the Calves of their Legs, the remaining part of their Legs being naked. They never cover their Heads, as a Te∣stimony of their Obedience and Reverence they shew to God: nor do they shave their Heads, but pull it out by the Roots, except a little upon the Crown of the Head. They also pull out their Beards after the same manner. There are several sorts of these <HI>Bramines,</HI> whereof some are call'd <HI>Sonkaes,</HI> which never go to the Temples, but per∣form their Religious Offices by themselves. Ano∣ther sort nam'd <HI>Tappaes,</HI> say their Prayers in the Temples. A third sort call'd <HI>Kurthurs,</HI> worship God in private without any Company. The fourth sort are call'd <HI>Onkelaus,</HI> which admit of no Images. The fifth sort, which is the strictest of all, bear the Name of <HI>Pushaleaus;</HI> these have a certain Festival Day nam'd <HI>Putcheson,</HI> which they keep every Month for five Days together; but between each Day of these five they observe a Time to Fast in. This Feast is generally kept in a Person of great Quality's House, and Charitable People commonly at that time, give Money to the Poor, that they may not kill any Beasts, or other Living Creature.</P>
<P>This Tribe is much stricter in many things than the other <HI>Bramines;</HI> for Marriage, which is al∣low'd to others, is forbidden them: and they are satisfi'd with less Meat and Drink than the rest, never eating any thing, except on the foremen∣tion'd Feast-Day, but what is given them, and never keep any thing for the next Day, or for an∣other Meal. They preserve and hold all things that have Life in greater Veneration than the other, and never drink Water till it be boil'd, to the end the Vapor, which they account the Soul thereof, should have time to evaporate and fly out. They keep little Sticks constantly by them to spread abroad their own Dung, so to prevent the Worms which might possibly be in the same, from being trod to death. They keep Hospitals for sick and lame Fowl, which they buy for Mo∣ney, and endeavor to cure them, All things are in common amongst them. They have but a slen∣der opinion of washing themselves in Water, but rather delight in foul and ditty Bodies.</P>
<P>The second Tribe is that of the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> which derives its Name from <HI>Kuttery,</HI> the second Son of <HI>Porous:</HI> And because God had given him Power to Govern others, all Kings and Martial People pretend to be Extracted from them. The place of the Book of <HI>Bremaw</HI> wherein the things concern∣ing this Tribe was describ'd, was fill'd with cer∣tain Commandments concerning Government and State-Policy, but of little consequence. These <HI>Kutteries</HI> may be describ'd these several ways, <HI>viz.</HI> How they were formerly in their flourishing Estate, how they liv'd after when first they began to decay, and how they live at present.</P>
<P>In their flourishing Estate they were Kings and Governors of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and especially of this Country of <HI>Surratte,</HI> and were at that time call'd <HI>Rajas,</HI> that is, <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Prince;</HI> of which some pos∣sess'd bigger Tracts of Land than others, according as they were more or less Powerful. These <HI>Rajas</HI> have commonly four sorts of Persons by them of Noble Aspect and Quality; the first sort whereof were <HI>Bramines,</HI> who by means of their Soothsayers acquainted their Kings with such Times as were by them accounted fortunate for any Design. The second was call'd <HI>Pardon,</HI> that is, <HI>A Politician,</HI> or one experienc'd in Matters of State, who dis∣patch'd all the King's Edicts, and had the general Care of the King's Business. The third was call'd <HI>Moldar,</HI> who perform'd the Office of Gentleman-Usher to the King, being continually with him and his Company. The fourth, call'd <HI>Disnache,</HI> ma∣nag'd all Martial Affairs, and Commanded as General over all the Militia. They say, that the <HI>Rajas</HI> were Extracted out of thirty six illustrious Families, some deriv'd of the Family or Tribe of <HI>Chaurah,</HI> others out of that call'd <HI>Solenkees,</HI> some of <HI>Vaggela,</HI> others of <HI>Dodepuchaes,</HI> and others from the <HI>Paramars;</HI> so that a Person of mean Extract can never attain to any great Dignity, but only those which were Extracted from one of these thirty six Tribes.</P>
<P>In this manner the <HI>Rajas</HI> liv'd in their flourishing Estate; as to what concerns their Fall, according to the testimony of their Histories, a certain holy and vertuous Woman, nam'd <HI>Rannedvil,</HI> progno∣sticated on her Death-bed, <HI>viz.</HI> That the State of the <HI>Rajas</HI> would decline under the Government of <HI>Ravisaldee,</HI> an eminent <HI>Raja;</HI> which hapned accor∣dingly, as may appear by the following Relation.</P>
<P>There was formerly, as their Histories make mention, a <HI>Raja</HI> call'd <HI>Syde Ravisaldee,</HI> after whose
<PB N="233" REF="168"/>Decease his Son built a stately Tomb, in a Place call'd <HI>Sythepolapore,</HI> so to express to his Successors the Affection and Reverence he bore to his Fa∣ther. When this magnificent Structure was fi∣nish'd with great Labor and Charge, he consulted with the <HI>Bramines,</HI> and desir'd to know of them if the stately Tomb he had built would be of any long continuance, or would be subject to decay, as well as other worldly things, &amp; by whom it should be ruin'd? Upon which a <HI>Madewnauger,</HI> experienc'd in the <HI>Bramines</HI> Art, answer'd, <HI>That a certain</HI> Sultan <HI>call'd</HI> Alaudin, <HI>King of</HI> Dely, <HI>should ruine the same, and make great Conquest in</HI> Surratte. <HI>Syde Ravisaldee,</HI> to prevent the ruine of this Structure, sent the <HI>Bramine Madewnauger</HI> with great Sums of Money to <HI>Dely,</HI> to this <HI>Alaudin,</HI> to obtain of him, that he would let his Fathers Bones rest, and not de∣stroy the Temple he had built for him. But the <HI>Bramine</HI> coming thither, could not find any Per∣son of that Name, in any Government or Com∣mand; but after long search, he was inform'd, that a certain Wood-cutter living there had a Son of that Name; whereupon going to this Man, who was extremely amaz'd to see him, he related to him his Journey, whilst the Son of <HI>Alaudin</HI> standing behind his Father, was preparing a Dish of Goats-flesh. The <HI>Bramine</HI> going to him, told him of the good Fortune that should attend him, and that on a certain Day he would come to be King of <HI>Dely,</HI> and make huge Conquests in <HI>Sur∣ratte;</HI> and that <HI>Syde Ravisaldee</HI> had sent to proffer him a great Sum of Money, requesting, that when he should be Victor, he would be pleas'd to de∣fend the Temple which he had built as a Monu∣ment over his Fathers Grave at <HI>Sythepolapore. Alaudin</HI> made this Answer, <HI>That it was beyond all possibility he should be so powerful, and attain such great Fortunes, yet nevertheless, if the Heavens had ordain'd it, it was not possible to prevent it, and it would be im∣possible for him to defend that Temple.</HI> He also gene∣rously refus'd the Presents and the Money which the <HI>Bramine</HI> proffer'd him; but his Father and Mother, whom his Necessity gave good Advice to, and knew better than he what was good for them, persuaded him to receive the Presents, partly to relieve themselves out of the present Indigency in which they were, and make use thereof, as an Instrument to attain to those things which were Prophesied. <HI>Alaudin</HI> hereupon liking their Advice, receiv'd them, and gave to the <HI>Bramine</HI> a written Paper to this effect: <HI>That since the Heavens had ap∣pointed he should fetch some Stones from this Structure, he would only take them from one Corner, without ruining it, as well to perform that which was foretold him, as to answer the Requests of</HI> Syde Ravisaldee.</P>
<P>With this Money <HI>Alaudin</HI> rais'd a considerable number of Soldiers, and happily succeeded in all his Enterprizes, insomuch that being press'd for∣ward by his good success, and emboldned by the Prophesie, that he should do such valiant Exploits, he at last attain'd to be King of <HI>Dely,</HI> conquer'd <HI>Surratte,</HI> and perfom'd that which he had promis'd <HI>Syde Ravisaldee;</HI> and also ruin'd many <HI>Rajas,</HI> to the great prejudice of the State of the <HI>Benjans,</HI> who then began to decline. But at last being wearied with the toil and care of War, which continu'd a long time, and was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roublesom, because ma∣ny <HI>Rajas</HI> retreated into inaccessible Places, he ap∣pointed one <HI>Futter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> to compleat his Victories.</P>
<P><HI>Alaudin</HI> seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Fortune had rais'd him from nothing to the highest Degree of Honor, he re∣solv'd to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re his Happiness with him who had the least thoughts thereof, and seriously consider∣ing thereupon a whole Night, he concluded to give the Government of all those Places which he possess'd in <HI>Surratte,</HI> to the first that should come and offer him any Presents; when, just as if it had been appointed, <HI>Futterkon</HI> came into his Cham∣ber to proffer him a Glass of Wine; which <HI>Alau∣din</HI> receiv'd with great joy, and immediately in the Face of his whole Army declar'd <HI>Futterkon</HI> Successor of all those Dominions which he had or should attain, and commanded all his Officers to shew him the Respect due to him as his Successor, and to obey and assist him in all things which were necessary for the carrying on and finishing the al∣ready begun Conquests. After which <HI>Alaudin</HI> retir'd to <HI>Dely,</HI> whilst <HI>Futterkon</HI> prosecuted his Conquests of <HI>Surratte,</HI> which the other <HI>Mahume∣tans</HI> that succeeded him in the Government of his Dominions compleated, to the destruction of the Realm of the <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>
<P>As to what concerns their present Condition, some <HI>Rajas</HI> that were in a good Condition, and others that retir'd into the middle of the Country, into Places which could not be conquer'd, are yet in Being, and Rob those Caravans which Travel by the Places of their Residence, and often Sally out to the Gates of the most strong and populous Cities for Booty. They have many brave Soldi∣ers that accompany them in these Enterprises, who are by some call'd <HI>Rasphootes,</HI> or <HI>Rasboten,</HI> and <HI>Rasbookes,</HI> and by others <HI>Resbuten, Raspouten, Reis∣butos,</HI> and <HI>Ragipous,</HI> which signifie <HI>Kings Children;</HI> for being of the Tribe of the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> in all pro∣bability they were deriv'd from those Noble Per∣sons that were destroy'd in the Conquest of <HI>Sur∣rate.</HI> Among those that were not conquer'd, and are at present living, is one <HI>Raja Surmulgee,</HI> whose Residence is at <HI>Raspeplaw;</HI> another <HI>Raja Berum∣shaw,</HI> at <HI>Molere;</HI> the <HI>Raja Ramnagar, Raja Burmul∣gee,</HI> and the great <HI>Raja Rannah,</HI> who have main∣tain'd many a Field-Battel against the <HI>Great Mo∣gol</HI>s Army. There are above a hundred <HI>Rajas</HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> Princes sprinkled up and down in this Realm, that are not under Subjection to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> nor pay any Tribute to him: some of them dwell near, others a good distance from <HI>Dely;</HI> among them are fifteen or sixteen very rich and powerful, but chiefly five or six; as the <HI>Raja</HI> resi∣ding in the Country of <HI>Jesselmeer,</HI> who formerly Reign'd as Emperor over the <HI>Rajas,</HI> and is said to be Extracted from King <HI>Porous;</HI> and likewise <HI>Jes∣seingue,</HI> and <HI>Jessomseingue,</HI> which are rais'd to that heighth, that if those three would but joyn toge∣ther, they would keep the <HI>Mogol</HI> sufficiently em∣ploy'd, each of them being able in an instant to bring twenty thousand Horse into the Field, bet∣ter Exercis'd and Arm'd than those of the <HI>Mogol.</HI></P>
<P>The present <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s chiefest Soldiers are <HI>Rajas,</HI> as <HI>Jesseingue, Jessomseingue,</HI> and others, to whom he gives great Salaries, to be always prepa∣red with a certain number of <HI>Ragipouts,</HI> their Sub∣jects, and maintains and keeps them as <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that is to say, as other strange Lords and <HI>Mahume∣tans,</HI> sometimes among those Forces which he al∣ways has to Guard him, and sometimes in the Field. These <HI>Rajas</HI> are commonly oblig'd to per∣form the same Duties that the <HI>Omrahs</HI> do, that is, to be upon the Guard, though with this distincti∣on, they do it not in any Garrisons like the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> but in their Tents, for they cannot brook being lock'd up twenty four hours together in a Fort; nor do they ever go into any of them, but with a
<PB N="234" REF="169"/>great Company of resolute Men, which have sworn to die by them on the Spot, as it sometimes happens when any Design has been plaid upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is oblig'd for several Reasons to keep these <HI>Rajas</HI> in his Service: First, because the <HI>Ra∣jas</HI> People are very warlike and valiant, and there are several of them able to bring above twenty thousand Horse into the Field. Secondly, that he may be the better able to keep in Subjection those <HI>Rajas</HI> which are under his Pay, and force them to pay Tribute when they refuse, or when out of fear or otherwise they will not venture out of their Country to come into the Field when the <HI>Mogol</HI> has occasion for them. Thirdly, to heighten or in∣crease their Jealousies one among the other the more, by shewing greater Favor to one than to an∣other. Fourthly, to employ them against the <HI>Pa∣tans,</HI> or his Enemies the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and Governors, in case any should offer to rebell against him. Fifth∣ly, to use them against the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> when he refuses to pay Tribute; or against the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> when he offers to Plunder them, or bring them under his Subjection; at which time the <HI>Mogol</HI> cannot repose any confidence in his <HI>Om∣rahs,</HI> which are most of them <HI>Persians,</HI> and of ano∣ther Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> not <HI>Sounnys,</HI> but <HI>Chias,</HI> as the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> and the King of <HI>Golkonda</HI> is. Sixth∣ly, and chiefly, to employ them against the <HI>Persi∣ans,</HI> when any opportunity presents, for then he cannot confide in his <HI>Omrahs,</HI> who, as we said be∣fore, are most of them <HI>Persians,</HI> and consequently can have no inclination to Fight against their na∣tural King.</P>
<P>The Country of the <HI>Resbutes</HI> borders on the side of <HI>Persia</HI> to the <HI>Motages,</HI> on the sides of the Ri∣ver <HI>Indus</HI> at the City <HI>Cambaya;</HI> also to the King∣dom of <HI>Dely,</HI> and Southerly to the Sea.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Purchas,</HI> this Country lies in the Road that leads from <HI>Surratte</HI> to <HI>Agra,</HI> and (as <HI>Maf∣fee</HI> affirms) borders on the West at <HI>Carmania;</HI> though more probably, as <HI>Davity</HI> hath it, <HI>Gedrosia,</HI> or the Country of the <HI>Motages</HI> or <HI>Nautaques.</HI></P>
<P>The Towns of this Country are <HI>Agra, Crodi, Vamista, Argeng,</HI> and <HI>Saurou;</HI> which last hath a ve∣ry strong Castle, besides the great City <HI>Sarruna;</HI> from whence it is fourteen Leages to <HI>Sinde,</HI> the Metropolis of this Kingdom. The Inhabitants al∣so possess several strong Places, amongst which is <HI>Dewras.</HI></P>
<P>This Country is very fruitful, and of an exceed∣ing fat Soil, producing abundance of all sorts of Provisions, having plenty of all things on the very Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Resbutes,</HI> or Subjects of these <HI>Rajas</HI> or <HI>Indi∣an</HI> Princes, were anciently, in the time of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> Kings of Countries, and Peers of this Realm, who defended their Country against In∣vaders, maintaining a continual War; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow they live in the Mountains, maintaining Wars a∣gainst the Moors, to avoid paying Tribute.</P>
<P>This Tribe hath spread it self very much, and is extreamly inclin'd to Robbing and Stealing, from whence in <HI>India</HI> they call a Robber <HI>Resbut</HI> or <HI>Rasapout. Ram</HI> granted them the liberty of taking as many Wives as they pleas'd, as also other war∣like Families, that so the Soldiers might not settle their Affections in one Place, but might be the freer to make Conquest, and propagate whereso∣e're they came; for were they confin'd to one Woman, they might perhaps take her along with them to their conquer'd Places, and setling there, be unwilling to depart thence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Resbutes</HI> are a rustick, deceitful, ill-natur'd, but yet a strong, valiant, and undaunted People, fearing no Dangers, though threatned with Death; whereas other <HI>Indian Heathens</HI> are mean spirited and timerous, carrying their Arms in their Mouths, and esteem Railing before Fighting.</P>
<P>They are very famous for Robbing and Steal∣ing; for they Plunder the Caravans, and murder all Travellers they meet with, if they make the least Resistance.</P>
<P>They have several little Harbors for small Barques, with which they Pyrate along the Coast.</P>
<P>They go naked from their Navel upwards, and wear <HI>Turbants,</HI> which differ in fashion from the <HI>Mogols.</HI></P>
<P>Their chiefest and only care, from the eldest to the youngest, is how to handle a Sword well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rajas,</HI> or Kings of the <HI>Ragipous,</HI> give their Subjects Lands for their Subsistance, on condition they shallal ways be ready to Fight when call'd to it; so that they might properly be styl'd a sort of Nobles, if the <HI>Rajas</HI> gave them Lands for them and their Children. They drink <HI>Amfion</HI> in great abundance, which they use from their Infancy; and when at any time they go to meet their Ene∣mies, they take a double Portion: for <HI>Amfion</HI> em∣boldning, or rather inebriating, makes them fear∣less of any Danger; so that they maintain a Bat∣tel like so many ravenous Beasts, never retreating, but die resolutely at the Feet of their <HI>Raja.</HI> They want nothing but good Discipline to make them good Soldiers, for Strength and Valor they have enough. It is very pleasant to see them intoxica∣ted with the foremention'd <HI>Amfion,</HI> how they em∣brace and bid each other farewel, like Men ma∣king account of nothing but Death: For among so many Sects of <HI>Hindouns</HI> or <HI>Heathens</HI> subject to the <HI>Mogol,</HI> there is only one Tribe of Soldiers or Fighting People call'd <HI>Resbutees,</HI> of whom the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> for their Valor, and some other Rea∣sons, is necessitated, though a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and con∣sequently a <HI>Heathen,</HI> to entertain a great number in his Service, treating them like other <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and making use of them in his Army as if they were <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> nay, they are promoted to the greatest Offices, and highest Employments under the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> as also under the King of <HI>Visia∣pour</HI> and <HI>Golkonda.</HI> Their Arms are Half-pikes, Swords or Simiters, and Shields; which being large and hollow, are fashion'd like a Bee-hive, and serve them to feed their Horses and Camels out of. Most of the <HI>Rajas</HI> use Horses which are swift of foot, handsom, and strong, and are always rid unshod.</P>
<P>The <HI>Resbutes</HI> eat all manner of Meat, except Beef and the Flesh of Buffalo's; which Beasts they hold in great Veneration. They drink Palm-Wine and Brandy, but not out of a Vessel out of which any other Tribes have drank before. They are all of them <HI>Heathens,</HI> and would never permit any <HI>Mahumetans</HI> to mix amongst them.</P>
<P>The Women resolutely leap into those Fires in which their Husbands were consum'd.</P>
<P>The third Tribe or Family, which is that of the <HI>Schudderies,</HI> derives its Name from <HI>Schuddery,</HI> the third Son of <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parkoutee,</HI> who was design'd for Trade; for all Traders are compre∣hended under that Name and Tribe.</P>
<P>That which the Book given to <HI>Bremaw</HI> exprest concerning this Tribe, consisted only in a few Commandments, instructing them how to live Honorably in their Emyloyments, to be Just as
<PB N="235" REF="169"/>well in Words as Deeds, and not to practise any Deceit or Fraud in their Trades, either in Buying or Selling.</P>
<P>Amongst this Tribe are those which by the <HI>Por∣tuguese,</HI> according to <HI>Texeira,</HI> are call'd <HI>Beneans,</HI> though he affirms their right Name to be <HI>Vaneans;</HI> but their common Name is <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>
<P>Some ascribe a peculiar Country to the <HI>Benjans,</HI> and border the same on one side of the Kingdom of <HI>Brampous,</HI> from which it is separated by the River <HI>Tynde,</HI> and on the other at the Country <HI>Surratte.</HI></P>
<P>The Towns of this Country are <HI>Daytaote</HI> near <HI>Surratte,</HI> and a Days Journey from <HI>Naubonne; Ne∣therbey</HI> and <HI>Saylote,</HI> five Leagues from <HI>Netherkey.</HI></P>
<P>The Country yields all sorts of Grain and Fruit in great abundance, especially Lemmons, Sugar-Canes, and Cotton.</P>
<P>Under the Name of <HI>Benjans</HI> are comprehended all those that are Merchants and Broakers; for there is nothing bought but by the Mediation and Approbation of those which are call'd <HI>Benjans,</HI> which in the Language of the <HI>Brahmines</HI> signifies <HI>An Innocent and Just People;</HI> for they cannot en∣dure that a Wasp or Flye, or any other living Creature, should be hurt, enduring patiently to be beaten without resistance. They manifest themselves to be a very Just and Pious People; for which reason, and because they are well ac∣quainted with the Country, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants employ them as Broakers, to Buy and Sell for them. They range all over <HI>Asia</HI> in great numbers to Traffick, but reside chiefly in <HI>Surratte.</HI> Moreover, they Buy and Sell after a strange and peculiar manner, quite different from any other People; for the <HI>Benjan</HI> or Broaker that treats with the Seller, making a Price of the Goods, appears with a little Board full of Figures, which is ty'd about his Waste, and laying it on his Knee, points to the number of Guilders which the Buyer is willing to give; after which the Seller in like manner expresses his Mind, by pointing to the Number which he will have for his Commodity.</P>
<P>Thus they Buy and Sell without speaking a word, according to the Commandments of their Law.</P>
<P>The fourth Tribe or Family, which is that of the <HI>Wyses,</HI> hath its Denomination from <HI>Wyse,</HI> the fourth Son of <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parkoutee,</HI> who was sent to invent all Arts and Handicrafts; wherefore all Artists and Mechanicks are comprehended under this Tribe: The Commandments relating to them, and contain'd in the Book deliver'd to <HI>Bre∣maw,</HI> tend chiefly to instruct them how to behave themselves justly and honestly in their Employ∣ments.</P>
<P>The Name <HI>Wyse</HI> signifies <HI>A Hireling,</HI> or one that is us'd like a Servant, because these People work for those that have occasion for them, as <HI>Wyse</HI> did, and all those that deriv'd from him.</P>
<P>This Tribe consists of two sorts of People; for some like the <HI>Benjans,</HI> abstain from Flesh and Wine, or use them very sparingly: The others are the <HI>Heathens</HI> of <HI>Visceraun,</HI> which they call <HI>De∣fil'd,</HI> or <HI>Unclean Pagans,</HI> because they allow them∣selves the liberty of eating Flesh, Fish, and other Creatures that had Life. These are generally the Rusticks, and meanest sort of People, which are <HI>Coulees.</HI> And as the most zealous of these <HI>Heathens</HI> have the greatest resemblance in Points of their Religion with the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> so do they likewise agree in the number of their Tribes, which are thirty six, equal to the Trades among them.</P>
<P>In all Mechanical Operations they use as few Tools as is possible, performing every thing they do in a contrary manner to that of the <HI>Europeans</HI> and <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>This is in short the Contents of the third Trea∣tise of the Book of <HI>Bremaw,</HI> concerning the four Tribes or Families, according as they live to this day.</P>
<P>This Book, which contain'd the Grounds of their Religion, and Rules of Government, being first given to <HI>Bremaw,</HI> and by him deliver'd to the <HI>Brahmines,</HI> who publish'd the same among the People, by teaching them the Precepts of Religi∣on, and Rules of Life which each Tribe were to observe; in order to which, those who had Power to Govern, kept their People in subjection, cau∣sing every one duly to perform his Office; the Priests or <HI>Brahmines</HI> instructed the People in their Religions, the Merchants drove the Trade, and the Handicrafts follow'd each their several Cal∣lings, to the great satisfaction of all those that made use of them.</P>
<P>Affairs being thus manag'd in the second Age, all things went very well; Religion was strictly observ'd and honor'd, Prayers were directed to God, and the three Persons, <HI>Bremaw, Wistney,</HI> and <HI>Ruddery;</HI> the Banks of Rivers were frequently vi∣sited, and the daily and usual Cleansing never neg∣lected.</P>
<P>But after the World increased, the Inhabitants thereof grew wicked, and degenerated from their first Principles; the <HI>Brahmines</HI> became Dissem∣blers; the <HI>Kutteries</HI> or Governors grew proud and ambitious, oppressing their Subjects, and abusing their Authority; the Merchants dealt fraudulent∣ly; the Handicrafts grew idle, and set too high a Price upon their Lahor.</P>
<P>The World thus degenerating, God was ex∣tremely incens'd thereat, and descended on the Mountain <HI>Merapurbatee,</HI> where he acquainted <HI>Bre∣maw</HI> how hainous the Sins of Mankind were, that he might admonish them to turn from their wicked Ways, and warn them of the approaching Judg∣ments which their Offences had justly merited.</P>
<P>The World hearkned a while to his Admoni∣tions; but soon after slighted them, and return'd to the commission of their former Crimes, which oblig'd <HI>Bremaw</HI> to intreat God for them: but God being unwilling to be reconcil'd to them, took him away, his limited time being expir'd, that so he might not be a Witness of those dreadful Judg∣ments that soon after were to fall upon the Chil∣dren of Men.</P>
<P>Then God acquainted <HI>Wistney</HI> with his Resolu∣tion to destroy all humane Creatures: wherefore <HI>Wistney</HI> interceded for them; but God not heark∣ning to him, commanded <HI>Ruddery,</HI> who was ap∣pointed to punish all Offenders, to raise a great Wind out of the Earth to destroy the People, and blow them away like Dust from the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Ruddery</HI> hereupon provok'd the Winds which were imprison'd in the Bowels of the Earth, cau∣sing them to break forth with great violence, inso∣much that they shook the Foundations of the Earth; the Day grew as dark as the Night, the Hills and Mountains were turn'd topsie-turvy, and the River <HI>Ganges</HI> remov'd out of its place; so that this terrible Storm destroy'd all Mankind, ex∣cept a few Persons, whom God permitted <HI>Wistney</HI> to preserve, for the propagating and re-peopling the World in the third Age, the second being ended in this dismal manner.</P>
<PB N="236" REF="170"/>
<P>When <HI>Ruddery</HI> had asswag'd the rage and fury of the Winds, all things were still and quiet, yet in a deplorable Condition, to see the World thus depriv'd of its Inhabitants, and utterly ruin'd; some were bruis'd against the Rocks, others lay heap'd one upon another in the Fields; which the Almighty seeing, was troubled at it, and <HI>Ruddery</HI> also very much griev'd to have been the Instru∣ment of so great a Destruction.</P>
<P>Now since these great Misfortunes and Pu∣nishments proceeded from the bad Conduct of the Kings, and those who Govern'd, God utterly destroy'd the Tribe of the <HI>Kutteries.</HI> Those that were sav'd by the Prayers of <HI>Wistney,</HI> consisted in a small number, and were only of the three other Tribes. But because the four sorts of Tribes were so perfectly necessary for the Governing of the World, insomuch that it could not be without them, and God had wholly destroy'd the Family of the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> therefore he resolv'd to renew the same by a Prince, and ordain'd that the Kings for the future should be Extracted out of the Family of the <HI>Brahmines,</HI> the chiefest whereof that were then living having been preserv'd by <HI>Wistney,</HI> were call'd <HI>Ducerat.</HI></P>
<P>The first Child which was born after this uni∣versal Destruction, was ordain'd to be the Race of Kings and Princes; who being zealously brought up, manag'd both the Affairs of State and Religi∣on, Governing the People with great Wisdom and Piety, according to their several Tribes; per∣form'd many heroick Acts, and was a Protector of all <HI>Brahmines</HI> and other Spiritual Persons. His Name was <HI>Ram,</HI> and by his Just and Pious Life at∣tain'd to that Dignity, that his Name is to this day exceedingly honor'd amongst them; for in their usual Salutations they with a loud Voice cry <HI>Ram, Ram,</HI> that is, <HI>I wish you Health and all Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certain many Just and Pious Kings Reign'd after him, but as all things do daily degenerate, so in process of Time receding farther and farther from their original Purity, they grew proud and ambitious, insomuch that they acted daily contra∣ry to the Commandments comprehended in the Book of <HI>Bremaw.</HI></P>
<P>These hainous Enormities did once more so highly incense the Almighty, that he gave Pow∣er to <HI>Ruddery</HI> to open the Earth, that it might swallow them up alive, except a few of each of the four Tribes, which he preserv'd to re-people the World anew with. And in this manner ended the third Age of the World.</P>
<P>Soon after God commanded that the World should be re-planted by those that were preserv'd, which was one <HI>Kysteney</HI> or <HI>Kistna,</HI> who was a fa∣mous King, Wise and Religious, and one of the most comely Persons of the former Age. He pro∣pagated Religion with great Zeal, insomuch that during his Life there was great Reformation a∣mongst the People, and very hopeful beginnings of Piety and Honesty.</P>
<P>When by <HI>Kysteney</HI>'s coming <HI>Wistney</HI>'s time was expir'd, God (as they relate) took him up to Hea∣ven, there being no further need of his, Service here below, because there would be no other World after this fourth Age; which, now in be∣ing, will (according to the Opinion of the <HI>Brah∣mines</HI>) last much longer than any of the former; and that after its ruine, <HI>Ruddery</HI> will be taken up to Heaven likewise.</P>
<P>They call these four Ages by four several Names, <HI>viz.</HI> the first <HI>Kurtain,</HI> the second <HI>Dnau∣per,</HI> the third <HI>Tetrajos,</HI> and the fourth <HI>Kolee.</HI></P>
<P>The manner of destroying this last Age will, as the <HI>Brahmines</HI> relate, be much more terrible than any of the former, to wit, by Fire: at what time <HI>Ruddery</HI> will gather all his Powers together, as absolutely necessary for the execution of so grand a Destruction. The Moon will shine red, the Beams of the Sun will be like the Flames of burning Brimstone; Thunder and Lightning will make a dreadful noise; the Sea will change into all manner of Colours, and Fire and Smoke will cover the surface of the Earth; the four Ele∣ments, of which the Heavens were first made, will maintain War against one another, and the World being thereby utterly destroy'd, will re∣solve into its first <HI>Primordia.</HI></P>
<P>The World will be destroy'd by Fire, as they suppose, for this reason, That it must be extin∣guish'd by that which gave it beginning; and be∣cause it consists of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, therefore it must be destroyd by these four Ele∣ments; for the former Ages (on which this Opi∣nion is grounded) were destroy'd, the first by Wa∣ter, the second by Wind, and the third by Earth; therefore the fourth and last must be consum'd by Fire.</P>
<P>This being finish'd, <HI>Ruddery</HI> shall carry all hu∣mane Souls up to Heaven, there to rest in the Bosom of the Almighty; but all Bodies will de∣cay: for they deny the Resurrection of the Body, affirming, That Heaven is too pure a Place for such gross and unclean Bodies.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdom or Territory of <HI>Chandish</HI> or <HI>Sanda.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Kingdom or Territory of <HI>Chandish,</HI> o∣therwise call'd <HI>Sanda,</HI> is by <HI>Robert Co∣vert</HI> call'd <HI>The Land of Heathens,</HI> or <HI>Countrey of the Great Can of Canouwe,</HI> formerly the Overseer of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s High-ways.</P>
<P><HI>Jarrick</HI> calls this Country, or a great part of it, <HI>The Kingdom of Brampour,</HI> or <HI>Brampore,</HI> or <HI>Baram∣pour,</HI> from its Metropolis. It borders in the West, on the Kingdom of <HI>Surratte;</HI> in the South, at <HI>De∣kan,</HI> having the Dukedom of <HI>Parthapsha</HI> between; in the North, at the Provinces <HI>Chitor</HI> and <HI>Malway;</HI> and in the East, at <HI>Berar.</HI> A certain <HI>English</HI> Wri∣ter borders the same on the one side, upon the Kingdom of the <HI>Benjans,</HI> from which it is separated by the <HI>Tynde</HI> or <HI>Tasy;</HI> and on the other side, upon the Country of <HI>Bulloits,</HI> having the great Stream <HI>Andre</HI> between; and is suppos'd to lie in 28 De∣grees Northern Latitude.</P>
<P><HI>Terry</HI> affirms this Kingdom to be a mighty and populous Country, and the South part of the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI>'s Dominions: It is divided in the middle by the River <HI>Tynde</HI> or <HI>Tasy,</HI> which makes the Coun∣try conveniently pleasant and fruitful about those Places through which it flows, though for the most part it is a barren, unwholsom, sandy, and dry Tract of Land: the Metropolis thereof is call'd <HI>Brampore,</HI> or <HI>Barampour;</HI> by <HI>Herbert</HI> and <HI>Jarrick, Breampour,</HI> and lies in 28 Degrees and 3 Minutes Northern Latitude, 220 Miles Eastward from <HI>Surratte,</HI> 420 from <HI>Asmeer,</HI> and 100 from <HI>Agra.
<PB N="237" REF="170"/>Herbert</HI> holds the same to be the ancient City <HI>Ba∣ramatis</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> and signifies <HI>Brachmans Pous,</HI> or <HI>The City of the Brachmans,</HI> because it was formerly, and is still to this day, an University of the <HI>Brah∣mines, Jogues,</HI> or <HI>Gymnosophists.</HI> The City lies low in a healthful and spacious Plain; it hath many Streets, but very narrow; their Houses are indif∣ferent handsom, though low. <HI>Purchas</HI> renders the same to be a very fair City, much bigger than <HI>London,</HI> and the most famous and richest which the <HI>Mogol</HI> possesses. On the North-East side of the City is a large strong Castle or Fort, on the Banks of the Stream <HI>Tapy.</HI></P>
<P>This City was formerly the Metropolis and Residence of the King of <HI>Dekan,</HI> who was in pro∣cess of time driven from thence.</P>
<P>Not far from thence is a Garden or <HI>Chan Channa,</HI> in which are many delightful Springs and Foun∣tains. The City is for the most part inhabited by <HI>Benjans.</HI> Before the Town, in the River <HI>Tapa</HI> stands an Elephant, most curiously Carv'd of Marble, which the <HI>Benjans</HI> worship.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1600. the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar,</HI> after having conquer'd the Kingdom of <HI>Dekan,</HI> made himself Master of this City <HI>Brampour,</HI> which was then desolate and deserted by King <HI>Miram,</HI> who was fled to the Fort <HI>Syr;</HI> which for its Situation and Strength is the most considerable of all the Coun∣try, and impregnable: for it lies on the top of a high Mountain, and is three Leagues in circumfe∣rence, surrounded with three Walls, which are so made, that the one may conveniently defend the other: for though <HI>Ekbar</HI> besieg'd King <HI>Miram</HI> with a hundred thousand Men, yet he could not conquer the same by Force, but only by Policy and Treachery.</P>
<P>In this Castle were anciently kept, according to the Custom of the Country, seven Kings with their Families and Retinues, which never came from thence, except that King of the Country which was nearest related to him, dy'd without a Male-Issue. Within it is a Fountain of fresh Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>The other Towns of this Country are <HI>Saddise,</HI> lying near the River <HI>Tynde,</HI> nine Leagues from the City <HI>Netherbey,</HI> and two Days Journey from <HI>Brampour;</HI> the next is <HI>Caddor,</HI> fifteen Leagues from <HI>Brampour,</HI> on the side of the <HI>Bulloits</HI> Coun∣try: then follows <HI>Sawbon,</HI> fourteen Leagues from <HI>Caddor; Kanowe,</HI> a great City, three days Journey from <HI>Caddor;</HI> fourteen Leagues farther flows the great River <HI>Andere,</HI> which runs to <HI>Bengala,</HI> where the utmost Limits of the <HI>Heathens</HI> terminate; and crossing this River you go out of the <HI>Heathens</HI> Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try into that of the <HI>Bulloits.</HI></P>
<P>Five Leagues Journey from <HI>Agra</HI> is a Castle call'd <HI>Hoffer,</HI> the most eminent, and the strongest of all the Province of <HI>Chandish;</HI> it is built on the top of a high and steep Mountain, incredibly for∣tifi'd by Nature, and able to contain forty thou∣sand Horse: in the middle of it are Springs which water the Mountain, and make the Earth so fruit∣ful in the production of Grass, Herbs, and Corn, that there is no want either of Provisions or other Necessaries: it is also Planted round about with very fine Brass Guns, which were brought thither by the last King of <HI>Surratte.</HI> But the Water which springs out of this Mountain is very unwholsom to drink, and causes Worms to grow in the Legs; which was the only Instrument whereby <HI>Ekbar</HI> conquer'd this Place.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Brampour</HI> are very affable and courteous, occasion'd perhaps by their con∣verting commonly with many of the Nobility, by whose Example the Vulgar are very much civi∣liz'd. Every Person may Hunt freely, without any interruption; and those that will not go on foot, may be furnish'd with a Horse at a very low Rate.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Kanowe</HI> drive a great Trade in Clothes, Swords, Musquets, and a certain Fruit to Dye withal; and those of <HI>Brampour</HI> in Cloth of Gold and Silver, Silks, and Woollen Cloth.</P>
<P>The Country is sufficiently fortifi'd against an Enemy; for <HI>Anno</HI> 1609. the King of <HI>Kanowe</HI> came with an Army of fifty thousand Elephants, thirty thousand Horse, ten thousand Camels, and three thousand Dromedaries, to attack the same. It is at this day Govern'd by a Substitute of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are <HI>Heathens,</HI> and worship the Sun as their Supreme God: They eat not the Flesh of any living Creature, according to the manner of the <HI>Pythagoreans.</HI> They adore all Crea∣tures as Gods, and worship that Beast they meet with first in the Morning for their God all that Day.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1600. the City of <HI>Brampour,</HI> with the whole Kingdom, and Fort of <HI>Sye,</HI> was conquer'd by the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar:</HI> for at the coming of <HI>Ekbar</HI> with his Army, after having conquer'd the Kingdom of <HI>Dekan,</HI> King <HI>Miram</HI> deserted die Ci∣ty of <HI>Brampour,</HI> and fled with all the Inhabitants and their Goods to the Fort <HI>Sye,</HI> so that <HI>Ekbar</HI> got nothing but the empty City, and therefore went from thence to <HI>Sye</HI> with an Army of 200000 Men. The Fortress was plentifully stor'd for ma∣ny Years with Wood, Corn, and other Provisions, for sixty thousand Men, and was fortifi'd with three thousand Pieces of Ordnance. In the Fort was, besides King <HI>Miram,</HI> and the seven other Heroick Princes; which though of the <HI>Mahume∣tan</HI> Religion, yet Extracted <HI>Portuguese;</HI> who ha∣ving the sole Conduct of this War, fortifi'd the Fort with no less Care than Art; so that the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI>'s Labor, though he had besieg'd the Fort with two hundred thousand, was all in vain; for the Besieged, by the convenient Situation of the Fort, their continual discharging of great Guns, and prudent management of Affairs, they prevented him from taking the same by Storm. When <HI>Ek∣bar</HI> saw that it was impossible to Conquer the Fort by Force, he resolv'd to try what he could do by Policy; wherefore he endeavor'd to attain his Ends by Money and Presents, and desir'd to enter into Conference with King <HI>Miram,</HI> swearing by his Head, the greatest Oath imaginable, that im∣mediately after he had spoken wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h him, he should return in safety to the Fort again. <HI>Miram</HI> being doubtful what might be the Event of this Busi∣nes, entred into Counsel with his Officers about it; where the <HI>Abyffinian</HI> Commanders, and seven other Princes, judg'd it altogether inconvenient for him to go out of the Castle: but others, who were entic'd thereto by Bribery, seem'd to be quite of another Opinion; whose Advice he follow∣ing, went out of the Fort, having upon him a Gar∣ment in fashion of a Cloke, which reach'd down to his Knees, as a testimony of his Submission: Coming to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> whom he found sitting like an Image, yet with a smiling Countenance, he bid him welcom three times; upon which <HI>Mi∣ram</HI> approaching nearer to him, bow'd down his
<PB N="238" REF="171"/>Head, when one of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Princes taking hold of him, threw him on the Ground; to which rude Affront 'twas judg'd <HI>Ekbar</HI> consented, not∣withstanding he seemingly reprehended him for his rashness, and mildly perswaded <HI>Miram</HI> to send Letters to the Watches which Guarded the out∣ward Walls: After which <HI>Miram</HI> requir'd liberty to return to the Castle; but <HI>Ekbar</HI> not regarding, his Oath, would not permit him to go back again. The <HI>Abyssinian</HI> Governor was no sooner inform'd of what had pass'd, but he sent his Son with a Let∣ter to the <HI>Mogol;</HI> in which he tax'd him with In∣justice, for detaining <HI>Miram</HI> contrary to his Oath, advising him to to let him return peaceably ac∣cording to his Promise. The <HI>Mogol</HI> hereby under∣standing, that the whole management of Affairs were left to the Discretion of this <HI>Abyssinian,</HI> thought if he could but corrupt him, the Place might be easily subdu'd; wherefore he ask'd the Son, If his Father would not come thither, in case King <HI>Miram</HI> should command him? To which the Youth boldly reply'd, <HI>That his Father was no such Person as he took him for, neither would he leave his Castle to come and Consult with him; that he must in vain expect to obtain the Fort with his Father's Con∣sent; and if he would not release</HI> Miram, <HI>yet there should not long want a Successor.</HI> Which confident Answer so incens'd <HI>Ekbar,</HI> that he caus'd the young Man immediately to be Stabb'd: which when his Fa∣ther had notice of, he presently sent the <HI>Mogol</HI> word, That he would beg of the Gods never to behold the Face of such a perfidious Prince; and afterwards taking his Sash in his Hand, he went amongst the Soldiers, and thus bespake them: <HI>Oh Brothers, the Winter approaches, which will drive the</HI> Mogol <HI>from the Siege, and, to avoid their utter Ruin, force them all to retire home: None but God shall ever he able to Conquer this Place, unless the Inha∣bitants thereof will surrender the same; therefore re∣solve valiantly to defend the same.</HI> Having ended this Speech, he went and Strangled himself im∣mediately. After his Decease the Inhabitants de∣fending the Place for some time, kept the <HI>Mogol</HI> continually employ'd; who, after he had us'd all possible means in vain, having no great Guns at hand wherewith to batter down the Walls, at last resolv'd to try if he could purchase the Inhabitants to a Surrender by great Sums of Money; which to accomplish, he sent to the Governors very con∣siderable Presents of Gold and Silver; whereby he did so cool and abate their Courage, that none of the seven Successors of the Realm durst assume the Government; for they perceiving the Gene∣rals to be fearful, and their Courage no longer to exert it self, could foresee and expect nothing but the sudden loss of the Place; and accordingly it so fell out: for after a few Days the Fort was sur∣rendred, and with it the whole Kingdom was sub∣jected to the <HI>Mogol,</HI> who got peaceable possession thereof, with an invaluable Treasure. He recei∣ved all the Inhabitants favourably, except the im∣prison'd King and the seven successive Princes, whom he dispersed into several Provinces, allow∣ing King <HI>Miram</HI> three thousand, and each of the other two thousand Ducats <HI>per Annum</HI> for their Maintenance.</P>

<P>THe Kingdom or Province of <HI>Agra</HI> is so call'd from <HI>Agra,</HI> the Royal Metropolis of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s whole Kingdom, be∣sides <HI>Dely</HI> and <HI>Lahor.</HI> Others call it <HI>Indostan,</HI> or <HI>In∣doustan,</HI> which signifies <HI>The Country of Indus:</HI> for <HI>Stan</HI> in the Country Language is <HI>A Country</HI> or <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI> and <HI>Indus</HI> is the Name of the River <HI>Indus,</HI> which moistens the Country.

<P>The Metropolis bears the same Name with the Province of <HI>Agra,</HI> and lies in 28 Degrees and 7 Minutes North Latitude, on the Banks of the River <HI>Jemini,</HI> which glides by its Walls, and dis∣embogues near the City <HI>Andakoda,</HI> into the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> two days Journey from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P>According to <HI>Herbert,</HI> this City was formerly call'd <HI>Nagra,</HI> and anciently <HI>Dionysia,</HI> and was built by <HI>Bacchus;</HI> but this seems incredulous, because within this hundred years the City <HI>Ratipor</HI> was far more beautiful, and bigger than that of <HI>Agra,</HI> which is believ'd to have had its Denomination from the River <HI>Arrany,</HI> which (as <HI>Arrian</HI> affirms) falls into the <HI>Ganges.</HI> It was built by King <HI>Ekbar</HI> after his Conquest of <HI>Surratte,</HI> and for its pleasant Situation made choice of for the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court and chief Place of Residence. It lies almost Triangu∣lar, or (as <HI>Herbert</HI> saith) Semi-Circular, surround∣ed with a strong Walk of Free-Stone, and a Moat of a hundred Paces broad. The Circumference of the City is reckon'd to be twelve <HI>German</HI> Miles. The Streets, which are very straight, are dirty, and three Leagues and a half long.</P>
<P>In the Northern part of the City, not far from the River, lies, the great and famous Royal Castle,

<P>At the Entrance of this Castle stands the Royal Court of Judicature, in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Diwanchane;</HI> before which is a large square <HI>Maidan</HI> or Plain, planted about with Trees; un∣der which Persons of Quality in hot Weather walk to cool themselves.

<P>Opposite to this Court stands a large square Building call'd <HI>Karchanay Schah,</HI> that is, <HI>The King's Treasure-house,</HI> with eight Arch'd Vaults, in which are kept the greatest part of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Treasure.

<P>Behind this Treasury stands another large square Palace, with a very delightful Garden, and is call'd <HI>Hara Michan,</HI> that is, <HI>The King's Wo∣mens Lodgings;</HI> for in it are kept twelve hundred of the King's Concubines, which are guarded and waited upon by six hundred Eunuchs.</P>
<P>Others describe this Court thus: It is three or four Leagues in circumference, surrounded with strong Walls of red Stone, and broad Moats with Draw-Bridges; it hath four Gates, one on the North, which is very strong; the second on the West side, is call'd <HI>Citsery,</HI> near the <HI>Bezar</HI> or Mar∣ket. Within this Gate is the King's Court of Ju∣dicature, where he decides all Differences; and behind that is the King's Hall, the Seat of the Vice-Roys. Within this Gate is also a Street built full of Houses, and about a Mile long. The third Gate, call'd <HI>Achabaerbederiwage,</HI> that is, <HI>The Gate of King Achbaer,</HI> lies on the South side, and and leads to the King's <HI>Derbaer,</HI> the Royal Throne, or inner Court; before which is a small Court, surrounded with Golden Rails, and cover'd on the top with Carpets, to keep off the heat of the Sun; beyond it is a Gallery, in which stands the King's Throne, adorn'd with Gold, Diamonds and Pearls, and all sorts of Precious Stones. No Person is per∣mitted to approach this Place without being call'd, except the King's Sons (which standing near him, cool him by continual fanning of him with Fans, in the Country Language call'd <HI>Pank∣hamh</HI>) and the Chief Secretary.</P>
<P>Within the foremention'd Court none are suf∣fer'd to enter but <HI>Ommirades</HI> or <HI>Omrahs,</HI> which are Dukes and great Lords.</P>
<P>Opposite to this Place hang golden Bells, which are rung by those that have sustain'd any preju∣dice, and are thereupon admitted to speak to the King, to make their Complaints to him, but not without great danger, if their Cause be not just.</P>
<P>In this Place the King appears every After∣noon, between three and four a Clock, besides thousands of other People, which take their Pla∣ces according to their Qualities, and with the King stay there till the Evening, hearing all fo∣rein Letters, which are read by the Setretary, and determining all other Businesses. Hither are also brought his Horses and Elephants, which are try'd by some of his Servants appointed for that pur∣pose. Within this third Gate is likewise a <HI>Sera∣glio,</HI> cover'd with a golden Roof.</P>
<P>The fourth Gate call'd <HI>Eersame,</HI> leads to a River, along whose Banks stands a beautiful Pa∣lace, where the King Salutes the Rising-Sun every Morning, whilst the most eminent Persons of his Court standing on a rising Ground, shew him Re∣verence, and the <HI>Hadys</HI> or Commanders of Horse, with other People, remain in the outward Court, not daring to come any farther, unless they are call'd. From hence also he beholds the Fighting with Elephants, Lions, Buffalo's, and other wild Beasts, which is perform'd every Day at Noon, except on Sundays.</P>
<P>In the inner Hall of the Royal Court come no People but the King's Eunuchs or Bed-chamber∣men, which are call'd <HI>Godia.</HI></P>
<P>In the inner part of the Castle are two Towers, one on the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and the other is built on the Treasury.</P>
<P>Within the Suburbs are many Courts, belong∣ing to the <HI>Chans</HI> and other great Lords, very arti∣ficially built, and adorn'd with many beautiful Works; the Cielings are richly Painted with Gold and Silver, and other Colours; the Walls are hung with Tapistry, and the Floor cover'd with rich Carpets.</P>
<P>In the midst of these Courts are for the most part square, or six-angled Springs, about which they Dine, and in hot Weather Bathe themselves.</P>
<P>In the Western part of the City, near the <HI>Met∣zid Nassar,</HI> stands a high Tower, rais'd of Ca∣mels Heads and Mortar. The ordinary Citizens Houses are but mean, yet built in good order. There are eight great Streets with Shops, besides many lesser; and also four large Arch'd Streets, each about half a Mile long, where all manner of Trades and Handicraftsmen keep their Shops, especially those that Deal in Silks and Cotton; Gold and Silver-Smiths, Shoemakers, Taylors, Coopers, Blacksmiths, and all other Trades, live each in a peculiar Corner. For travelling Mer∣chants and others, there are eighty <HI>Serrais</HI> or <HI>Ka∣ravanseraes,</HI> which are large square Courts, inclo∣sed with high Stone Walls, at each end whereof stands a Watch-Tower, out of which they go in∣to the several Galleries, wherein are Lodging-Rooms, each of them having Doors to lock, and also Chimneys; there are commonly two or three Rooms one over another. Under these Chambers are great Arch'd Stables for Horses, Asses, Oxen, and Camels; and in the midst of the Yard stands a Spring with running Water, or a Vault with standing Water; they were built by the great <HI>Mogol Ekbar,</HI> after he had conquer'd the Kingdom of <HI>Surratte,</HI> and is said to have cost him two Millions and a half of <HI>Ropias,</HI> a <HI>Ropia</HI> be∣ing valu'd at 2 s. <HI>Sterl.</HI></P>
<P>There are likewise four hundred <HI>Hamans</HI> or Baths, which are daily visited by several Persons, who pay each a <HI>Sektzai</HI> for their Entrance.</P>
<P>Severity large, besides many lesser <HI>Metzids</HI> or Temples, are also no small Ornament to this City, especially six, which are the chief; in one of which lies Interr'd the Body of a Saint call'd <HI>Scan∣dar,</HI> the Successor of <HI>Hussein Alys</HI> Son. This Tem∣ple possesses great Riches and Privileges, it being an <HI>Allakapi,</HI> or Privileg'd Place: for whosoever flies thither, though he hath committed the great∣est Crime imaginable, nay, though he had at∣tempted to kill the King himself, he is free from all Punishments as long as he can stay there: if he
<PB N="240" REF="172"/>hath Money, there is Meat brought him by the <HI>Derwish,</HI> who is a person which at Set-times cries the <HI>Illa lailah illa allah, &amp;c.</HI> from the Temple Stee∣ple, to gather Alms.</P>
<P>Not far from the <HI>Netherland East-India</HI> Compa∣nies Factory which they have in this City, stands a <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zid</HI> call'd <HI>Jakod;</HI> near which lies buried a Giant call'd <HI>Baxi Schah,</HI> of whom the <HI>Moors</HI> tell many incredible stories: the Grave is 36 soot long, and eight broad: on each Corner stands a great Column hung full of little Flags, on which in <HI>In∣dostan</HI> Characters stands written the Life of this mighty Heroe; and in each Pillar is a Hole, in which Lamps burn Night and Day, to the Honor of <HI>Baxi Schah.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Baxi Schah</HI> is by the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> honor'd almost as high as God; for they go thither to pay their Devotions, and believe, that by Praying to him they shall immediately receive Absolution for all their Sins: they also swear by his Name.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s permission the <HI>Benjans</HI> have also many <HI>Pagods</HI> in this City.</P>
<P>There are four Custom-houses built in four se∣veral places of this City, where Merchants Enter and pay Custom for their Goods, and the tenth Peny of all things they carry out of the City with them.</P>
<P>This City is inhabited by divers Nations, but the chiefest and most eminent are the <HI>Hassanists, Tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars, Benjans, Armenians, Turks, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> besides several <HI>Europeans.</HI> There are also <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Augustine Monks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Agra</HI> is a very populous City, and can on occa∣sion bring two hundred and fifty thousand Men in∣to the Field. In it is great store of Salt-petre and Indigo to be had, which the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> carry from thence in great quantities. Not only within, but also round about the City, are very de∣lightful Gardens, some whereof belong to the <HI>Mo∣gol,</HI> who oftentimes goes to walk and Dine in them, whilst a considerable number of Women Dance naked before him.</P>
<P>The Jurisdiction of <HI>Agra</HI> from all Parts, extends twelve Days Journey through a Plain and fertile Country, which contains forty great and small Towns, and three thousand five hundred Villages. Without the City is a House wherein are kept all sorts of wild Beasts, as Elephants, Tygers, Lions, Buffalo's, and wild Bulls, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> keeps to sport withal, either by letting them fight one against another, or encounter with such Men as will be accounted the most valiant of the Coun∣try, or with such as are constrain'd upon forfeiture of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Favor to engage with them.</P>
<P>About the Year 1620. the City of <HI>Agra</HI> was by the <HI>Sultan Chorrom, Selim</HI>'s Son, ruin'd and plunder'd a second time with far greater cruelty of the Soldiers than formerly, perhaps in revenge for the Loss which they sustain'd before the Castle, which they Storming in vain, lost many Men, who were slain by the Besieged.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Lahor</HI> is a Walk planted with Trees four hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles in length, and is by Travellers, who refresh themselves un∣der the cool shading Trees, accounted one of the most delightful Places in the whole World, there being several brave Houses for Entertainment built along the High-way.</P>
<P>A League and a half from <HI>Agra,</HI> on the Way from <HI>Lahor,</HI> is a Place call'd <HI>Tzekander,</HI> where the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar</HI> erected a great Burying-place for himself and his Successors; to which his Son <HI>Jangheer</HI> contributed very largely: and though there had been above twenty four Millions of <HI>Ropias</HI> bestow'd on the same, yet it was not near finish'd in the Year 1626. The whole Structure is of hewn Stone, divided into four large Squares, each three hundred Paces: at the Corners of each stands a little Tower of colour'd Marble. It lies in the midst of a very fine Garden, surrounded with a Wall of red Stone, within which is a Turret, from which you see into a little, but exceeding de∣lightful Garden.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Fettipore,</HI> or <HI>Fatipor,</HI> by <HI>Jarrick</HI> call'd <HI>Fateful</HI> or <HI>Pateful,</HI> by <HI>Cowert, Fetterbat,</HI> and by <HI>Her∣bert, Fettipour,</HI> was anciently call'd <HI>Tzikkerim,</HI> or <HI>Sykary,</HI> and lies twelve <HI>Kours,</HI> or four Leagues from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P>This City was upon the following occasion built by the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar, viz.</HI> At his Re∣turn from <HI>Asmer,</HI> whether he went to visit the Tomb of <HI>Mandy,</HI> he visited St. <HI>Derwis,</HI> or a poor Monk call'd <HI>Seid Selim,</HI> that is, <HI>Seid Selim,</HI> who accounted himself highly honor'd, that God had employ'd him to tell <HI>Ekbar,</HI> that in a short time he should be the Father of three beautiful Children; and indeed <HI>Ekbar</HI> to acknowledge the Kindness, would have his eldest Son call'd <HI>Selim,</HI> the second <HI>Chan Morad,</HI> or <HI>Amurath,</HI> and the third <HI>The Haen Schach,</HI> or <HI>Daniel:</HI> nay, this Prophecy was so ac∣ceptable to <HI>Ekbar,</HI> that he caus'd a fair <HI>Mosque</HI> to be built there, and inclos'd both that and the an∣cient City <HI>Tzikerim</HI> or <HI>Sykary,</HI> with a high Wall, and from that time caus'd it to be call'd <HI>Fettipore,</HI> that is, <HI>A Place of Delight:</HI> nay, his Affections were so strongly inclin'd to this City, that he built a Palace there, and also a <HI>Bazar</HI> or Exchange, the fairest in all the Eastern Parts, resolving far∣ther to make it the Metropolis of the whole King∣dom, for which it stood very convenient, being seated on the Bank of a River; yet the unwhol∣somness of the Air forc'd him to leave the same: since which time it is become a ruin'd and desolate Place.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Cower</HI> affirms, that this City is much bigger than <HI>London,</HI> and is adorn'd with a Temple very artificially built, though much decay'd.</P>
<P>The whole Tract of Land between this City and <HI>Agra,</HI> is always throng'd with People like a Market.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Bian</HI> is four Leagues from <HI>Fatipor;</HI> beyond which are the Towns <HI>Ladana, Mosabadan,</HI> and <HI>Bandason;</HI> next lie <HI>Asmeer</HI> or <HI>Esmeer,</HI> where the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar</HI> had a large House or Stable, in which he commonly kept six hundred Ele∣phants, and a thousand Horses.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Asmeer</HI> lies in 35 Degrees and 15 Minutes Northern Latitude, on a high and inac∣cessible Mountain, twenty five Leagues from <HI>Agra.</HI> The greatest part of the City lies at the foot of the Mountain, well built, but ill fortifi'd; notwithstanding the Wall is of good Stone. A Prophet, one of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Disciples, lies buried there in a stately Tomb, to which belong three pleasant Yards, pav'd with Free-stone, polish'd af∣ter the <HI>Persian</HI> manner.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is <HI>Godach,</HI> formerly the Re∣sidence of an eminent and very valiant <HI>Rasbout.</HI></P>
<P>Some place the City <HI>Fatipor</HI> in the Province of <HI>Bando.</HI></P>
<P>At every half Leagues distance between <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Asmeer,</HI> stands a Pillar or Column, resem∣bling those which the <HI>Romans</HI> us'd to erect at the distance of a thousand Paces. At the end of every
<PB N="241" REF="172"/>twenty five Mile there is an Inn or Place of En∣tertainment for Men and Horse, where certain Women constantly give their attendance, and get ready such Victuals for every one as they desire; for which, and their Horse-meat, they pay Three pence.</P>
<P>There are also fair Houses at every ten Miles distance, which were built by the <HI>Great Mogol Ek∣bar</HI> for the convenience of his Women, when he took a Journey to <HI>Asmeer</HI> to visit the Tomb of <HI>Mandy, Mahomet</HI>'s Disciple.</P>
<P>The whole Country being water'd by the Stream of <HI>Jemna,</HI> aboundeth with Corn, Lem∣mons, Oranges, Cherries, Pears, Apples, Plums, and other Fruit; amongst which are Grapes, which being preserv'd, are as big as <HI>Damas</HI> Pruins. There also grows abundance of <HI>Anil,</HI> or Indico, and store of Cotton. Saltpetre is likewise very plentiful here; and all sorts of Poultry, Falcons, Phea∣sants, Partridges, Hearns, and Wild-ducks. Here are also great store of Goats, Cows, and Hogs; and Fish in such abundance, that Eighteen pence will purchase enough to feed three hundred Men.</P>
<P>In <HI>Agra</HI> are generally kept four Markets, where besides Provisions, divers other Goods are sold. From <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>China</HI> are Transported hither con∣siderable Quantities of Gold and Silver Cloths, which though slighter, are yet dearer than those of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In this City, as also in <HI>Lahor,</HI> the Inhabitants drive a great Trade in <HI>Anil,</HI> or Indico; and at <HI>Bandason</HI> there is vast quantities of Course Wooll, Cotton, Lances, Bowes, Javelins, Swords, and other Arms. In <HI>Lahor</HI> are commonly kept two Markets: The Inhabitants drive also a great Trade to Forein Parts.</P>
<P>When the King resides at <HI>Agra,</HI> no Stranger is permitted to stay there above twenty four Hours, unless they give him an account of their Business, and of what Quality and Country they are; but none are permitted to see him without a Present.</P>
<P>In this City the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> keep a Factory for their <HI>East-India Company,</HI> who maintain four or five Persons, which formerly made a great advan∣tage on Scarlet Cloth, great and small Looking-glasses, and other Merchandises; and also by buy∣ing of Indico, which grows about <HI>Agra,</HI> but espe∣cially at <HI>Bianes,</HI> two days Journey from thence, whither travelling twice a Year, they have built a Lodge or Store-house there, where they buy in all those Stuffs or Cloths which come from <HI>Jelapour</HI> and <HI>Laknau,</HI> about six or eight days Journey from <HI>Agra.</HI> But at this time it is said the Gain is nothing so considerable; whether it be because the <HI>Arme∣nians</HI> drive that Trade themselves; or because <HI>Agra</HI> lies so far from <HI>Suratte,</HI> that one Accident or other doth generally befal their <HI>Caravans,</HI> which are constrain'd to travel by the City <HI>Amadabad,</HI> through the <HI>Raja's</HI> Country, to avoid the bad Ways and Mountains which lye on the side of <HI>Go∣valeor</HI> and <HI>Brampour,</HI> which is the shortest way.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Bulloits,</HI> which by <HI>Robert Covert</HI> are call'd <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> border on one side at the River <HI>Andere,</HI> which seperates them from the Country of <HI>Kanawe</HI> or <HI>Brampour,</HI> other∣wise <HI>Chandisch</HI> and <HI>Surratte;</HI> and on the other side, at the River <HI>Tamlao</HI> or <HI>Tamliko,</HI> which is the Boun∣dary between them and the Kingdom of <HI>Agra.</HI> The Towns of this Country are <HI>Gorra, Sandaye, Erasmie, Zingrene, Barrandon, Tranado, Zajoberdee,</HI> and <HI>Haud.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gorra</HI> lieth a days Journey from the River <HI>An∣dere,</HI> and is about two Leagues in Circumference. Two of the King's Sons formerly maintain'd a long War about this City, till <HI>Theile</HI> King of <HI>Ost∣lohm</HI> obtain'd the Victory; and after a seven year peaceable possession thereof, he was also conquer'd by the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> the sixth of <HI>Tamerlain</HI>'s Succes∣sors, who made himself absolute Master of all this Country.</P>
<P>Two days Journey from <HI>Gorra</HI> is the City <HI>San∣daye;</HI> beyond which, about twenty two Leagues further, lies <HI>Erasmie;</HI> and seven Leagues further, <HI>Zingrene,</HI> eight Leagues from which is the City of <HI>Barrandon.</HI> After six days Journey from hence, through a thick Wood, you come to the City <HI>Tranado;</HI> eight Leagues beyond which is <HI>Zajober∣dee▪</HI> and nine Leagues further, <HI>Haudee,</HI> which hath a Castle built on a Rock, and fortified with many Guns. A days Journey from thence flows the River <HI>Tamliko,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Indus</HI> at the Place where it separates the <HI>Indostans</HI> from the <HI>Bulloits.</HI></P>
<P>In this Country, near the City <HI>Zajoberdee,</HI> is great plenty of Corn; and about <HI>Zingrene,</HI> great abundance of Oats and Beasts: But especially near <HI>Sandaye,</HI> where the Fruit call'd <HI>Mangas,</HI> and Sugar-canes, grow in such abundance, that they give them to their Horses in stead of Hay. Sheep are here in incredible numbers, whose Wooll be∣ing like the <HI>Spanish,</HI> is by the Inhabitants us'd to make Cloth. The Woods abound with Elephants, Lions Tygers, Apes, and other Beasts. There are Inns in most Places where Horses, Camels, and other Beasts are set up, and fed, at the Ex∣pence of the Publick, without any Charge to the Traveller. In the City of <HI>Gorra</HI> are kept four Publick Schools.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bulloits</HI> were formerly a deceitful and cruel People: At this day they retain that barbarous Custom of burning the Women alive after their Husbands decease; but if any Woman refuse thus brutishly to sacrifice her self, they then cause her Hair to be cut off, and clothe her in Black; and she is ever after accounted so ignominious and dishonorable, that not the meanest Person will vouchsafe to assist or visit her.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sandaye</HI> is great store of Wooll and Cotton, with abundance of Swords, Lances, and o her Weapons. Many Merchants have likewise re∣course to this City, as <HI>Benjans, Mesulipatans;</HI> and great <HI>Caravans</HI> come to <HI>Barrandon,</HI> where are sold all sorts of Arms, Hats made of Wooll, and Ele∣phants Teeth.</P>

On the North it conterminates with the Kingdom of <HI>Multan;</HI> or, as others affirm, they Inhabit the Northern Parts of <HI>Asmeer,</HI> and those Parts that lye next to <HI>Multan.</HI> They are also spread through all <HI>Surratte,</HI> and are employ'd as Soldiers to Garrison Towns and Fortresses, they being stout and undaunted People, and not inferior to the <HI>Raspoutes</HI> and <HI>Patannes.</HI></P>
<P>The Metropolis, according to <HI>Daviti,</HI> is <HI>Hen∣downe,</HI> which bears the same Denomination with the whole Country: The next Town is <HI>Rimala,</HI> and the great City <HI>Mearta:</HI> then follows <HI>Towri,</HI> and about twenty two Leagues from thence, the City <HI>Geissemer,</HI> seated in a very delightful Place.</P>
<P>The Country yields plenty of Corn, Cotton, Fodder for Beasts, and abounds with Sheep and Fowls. The Inhabitants are generally great Rob∣bers. They dress and eat their Meat in a round spot of Ground, into which, while they are about preparing and eating their Food, they suffer no other Person to come. The Women from their Infancy wear little Silver, Copper, and Iron Chains about their Legs, and Pendants in their Ears, (in which they make holes as big as they may easily thrust their Fingers through) and Arm∣lets from their Wrists up to their Elbows.</P>
<P>In <HI>Mearta</HI> are weekly kept seven Markets, where they drive a great Trade in Indico, Callico, and Woollen Cloth; as also at <HI>Gasmeer.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Hindous,</HI> though abstracted from <HI>Heathens,</HI> eat all sorts of Meats, both Flesh and Fish, except that of an Ox or Cow. When they pray, they strip themselves stark naked, and main∣tain a Doctrine different from the <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>

<P>In this Province, twenty five Leagues from the City <HI>Agra,</HI> near the Place where the <HI>Jemni</HI> falls into the <HI>Ganges,</HI> lies a stately Palace, now call'd <HI>Helabassa,</HI> but formerly <HI>Praye,</HI> and founded by the <HI>Rajas</HI> of that Place, in testimony of their Subje∣ction to <HI>Ecbar,</HI> when they submitted themselves to his Jurisdiction. The most remarkable thing near this Palace is a large and dark Valley, where∣in are kept, as precious Relicks, some Images, which the Inhabitants affirm to be of <HI>Adam, Eve, Seth, Enoch, Methusalem,</HI> and others, which, as they relate, liv'd in this Place. Great Companies of <HI>Benjans</HI> come daily hither from all Parts, to bless themselves here, and purifie or wash them∣selves from all their Sins in the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> which they account Holy. They shave off all their Hair, and ease themselves thereof, as an un∣clean and unnecessary Burden, and promise to themselves great Benefits by the loss thereof. The Palace is surrounded with a treble Wall, whereof the first is of square Red Stones, the second of White, and comprehends an <HI>Obelisk</HI> of seventy two Foot high, erected by <HI>Alexander the Great.</HI> The King spent above twelve hundred thousand <HI>Ropias</HI> to build this Palace, of which the Kings of <HI>Patan</HI> have often endeavor'd to make themselves Ma∣sters, because of the conveniency of the Rivers which are so near it. There is also a Sanctified Tree, which the Kings of <HI>Patan</HI> have endeavor'd to root out, but could never attain to it.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Helabas</HI> is a magnificent Tomb, which King <HI>Sanghir</HI> built in honour to his first Wife, the <HI>Raja Maminseng</HI>'s Daughter, who poyson'd her self when she heard of her Son <HI>Sultan Gosrou</HI>'s Insurrection.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdom of <HI>Decan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Decan</HI> is, according to <HI>Juan de Baroes,</HI> generally taken for the whole Extent which the Country of <HI>Cuncan</HI> comprehends, because the Inhabitants call that Tract of Land <HI>Cuncan</HI> which extends it self along the Sea, from North to South, to the River <HI>Aliga;</HI> and from East to West, from the Sea to the Mountains of <HI>Gate:</HI> So that these People are call'd <HI>Cuncanyns.</HI> and not, as the <HI>Portuguese</HI> im∣properly stile them, <HI>Canariins.</HI> But the Coast of <HI>Decan,</HI> which extends Eastward to the Mountains of <HI>Gate,</HI> is call'd <HI>The Kingdom of Decan;</HI> and the Inhabitants, <HI>Decanyns:</HI> and, as <HI>Linschot</HI> hath it, this Country is also call'd <HI>Ballagate,</HI> that is, <HI>The Upper Gate;</HI> for <HI>Balla</HI> signifies <HI>Upper,</HI> and <HI>Gate, A Mountain.</HI> Or rather the Country of <HI>Ballagate</HI> (by <HI>Ananie</HI> call'd <HI>Bilagate</HI>) is that Land which extends over and among those Mountains; as appears by the Description of <HI>Linschot,</HI> who makes three Kingdoms of this Country, dividing it into <HI>Balla∣gate, Decan,</HI> and <HI>Cuncan.</HI></P>
<P>All these three Countries, taken together, bor∣der on the North at the Kingdom of <HI>Cambaye</HI> or <HI>Zurratte,</HI> with the Stream <HI>Bate</HI> between both, and also at the Kingdom of <HI>Orixa;</HI> on the East, at the Kingdom of <HI>Narsinge;</HI> on the West, at the Sea; on the South, at <HI>Canara,</HI> being parted by the River <HI>Aliga.</HI></P>
<P>This Country extends it self along the Sea above 250 <HI>Italian</HI> Miles; or, as <HI>Ananie</HI> saith, full sixty two <HI>German:</HI> that is, from the Mouth of the Stream <HI>Bate,</HI> to that of <HI>Aliga;</HI> or rather, as <HI>Juan de Baroes</HI> hath it, from <HI>Chaul</HI> to the River <HI>Aliga</HI> in <HI>Sintacora</HI> is sixty five <HI>Spanish</HI> Miles. But <HI>Texeira,</HI> and other Modern Writers, rightly distinguish the Country of <HI>Decan</HI> from that of <HI>Cuncan</HI> or <HI>Visiapour,</HI> by its extent to the North, calling that Country <HI>Cuncan</HI> which extends to the South, and that which lies more to the North, and nearer to <HI>Cam∣baye, Decan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Decan</HI> borders on the North at <HI>Cambaye,</HI> on the East, at the Mountain of <HI>Ballagate;</HI> on the South, at <HI>Cuncan;</HI> and on the West, at the Sea. It ex∣tends from the South to the North along the Sea∣coast of <HI>Sifferdan</HI> to <HI>Negotana,</HI> a Tract of twenty Leagues, and runs up into the Country near <HI>Cam∣baye.</HI></P>
<P>The Metropolis of <HI>Decan,</HI> according to <HI>Texeira,</HI> is call'd <HI>Hamedanager;</HI> by <HI>Ananie,</HI> and some others, singly <HI>Danager;</HI> by others, <HI>Amdadanager,</HI> who place it up in the Country, and make it the King's Residence, affirming, That he made this the Seat of his Realm, because of the pleasant Situation of the City, and the delightful Gardens about the same: Yet there are some that make <HI>Beder,</HI> or <HI>Bi∣der,</HI> by <HI>Barbosa</HI> call'd <HI>Mavider,</HI> the Metropolis of all <HI>Decan,</HI> and Residence of the Kings. Next to this, is reckon'd the City of <HI>Decan.</HI></P>
<P>In this Kingdom lies also a City built near the Sea-shore, which <HI>Texeira</HI> calls <HI>Chaul;</HI> but <HI>Baroes,
<PB N="244" REF="174"/>Chiaul;</HI> by <HI>Della Valle, Ciul,</HI> and <HI>Chaul;</HI> and by <HI>Barthema, Ceuul:</HI> which by <HI>Castald</HI> is taken for the ancient City <HI>Camane</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> It lies ten Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Bazzain,</HI> in 19 De∣grees and 50 Minutes of Northern Latitude, two Leagues from the Sea, near a River, which by the help of the Flood coming from the Sea, brings up Ships close to the Walls of the City: It runs up a great way into the Country, from whence it takes its Course, trending through Hills and Valleys, till it discharges it self into the Sea, ma∣king a spacious Haven in the midst of the Bay below the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> have two Forts here, whereof the one was built <HI>Anno</HI> 1520. by <HI>Diego Sequeira,</HI> who obtain'd leave of the King for it: The other built by the <HI>Moors,</HI> is on the other side of the Ha∣ven, <HI>viz.</HI> on the Right hand when you enter into it. To the Southward of this Haven lies a fa∣mous Mountain, in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Il Morro di Ciul,</HI> that is, <HI>A Member of Ciul,</HI> which commands both the City and Harbor, having a Fortress built on the top, which is in a manner in∣accessible, and belong'd formerly to the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Decan,</HI> that is, to <HI>Nizam Schiah</HI> King or Lord over all the adjacent County.</P>
<P>This Fortress was conquer'd by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who with discharging their Musquets at an Ele∣phant which was by the <HI>Moors</HI> plac'd to defend the Gate, with a great Chain in his Mouth, so frighted him, that he remov'd to one side, and per∣mitted the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to creep under his Belly, and make themselves Masters of the Place. But others relate, that the Place was taken after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> When the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had first with a handful of People defeated a considerable Party of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and put them to flight, they retreat∣ed to the Fort <HI>Il Morro di Ciul,</HI> where they thought to be secure from the fury of the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> but an Elephant being wounded in the Battel, and re∣tiring amongst them towards the Fort, fell down dead at the entrance of the Gate, which then could not be shut against the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who by firing boldly upon their Opposers, soon made them∣selves Masters of the Place, which since that time they have made much stronger, and by that means defended the City <HI>Chaul</HI> from the continual As∣saults of the <HI>Moors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pyrard</HI> tells us, That there are two Cities call'd <HI>Chaul,</HI> in one of which inhabit abundance of Handicrafts and Tradesmen. In this City is a famous Temple dedicated to the Goddess <HI>Cran∣gene.</HI></P>
<P>Without the City is a Toll-house: Also the Chief Church of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> stands near the Sea-shore, not far from which is a Cloister of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> with a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
<P>Southward from <HI>Chaul,</HI> by the Sea, lies a Place by <HI>Barbosa</HI> call'd <HI>Banda,</HI> or <HI>Dando;</HI> but by <HI>Della Valle, Danda Rajiapori:</HI> Near this lies the City <HI>Ziffardan,</HI> or <HI>Zeferdani,</HI> the utmost Limits of the Kingdom of <HI>Decan.</HI> In the same Tract, towards <HI>Banda,</HI> is a Bay call'd <HI>Kelsi,</HI> the Country on the South side whereof is very Mountainous. In <HI>De∣can</HI> is also a City call'd <HI>Petan,</HI> or <HI>Patan,</HI> which pro∣duceth abundance of fine Callico.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Decan</HI> is very fertile, produ∣cing all things in great plenty, and agrees in most things with that of <HI>Cuncan;</HI> and the Inhabitants also agree in their Constitutions, Habits, and man∣ner of Living: Wherefore we will here give an accout of them promiscuously, and at large.</P>
<P>The Air at <HI>Chaul</HI> is more hot than cold. The Soil thereabouts plentifully produces all things except Raisins, Nuts, and Chess-nuts. Oxen, Cows, and Horses are here in great numbers. The Inhabitants of <HI>Decan</HI> are call'd <HI>Decanyns,</HI> as those of <HI>Cuncan, Cuncanyns.</HI></P>
<P>After what manner the Countries of <HI>Decan, Ballagate,</HI> and <HI>Cuncan,</HI> or <HI>Visiagour,</HI> which were for∣merly under the Jurisdiction of one Prince, are become subject to several Lords, I shall here give this brief Account.</P>
<P>About three hundred years since the King of <HI>Dely</HI> brought all the neighboring Kingdoms, but particularly those of <HI>Decan, Cuncan,</HI> and <HI>Ballagate,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Goa,</HI> under his Subjection: At the same time when the Country of <HI>Cambaye</HI> was conquer'd by the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> who treated the <HI>Reisboutes,</HI> Inhabitants or the Country, very tyrannically.</P>
<P>The Kingdoms of <HI>Ballagate</HI> and <HI>Decan</HI> were for∣merly govern'd by <HI>Heathen</HI> Kings, and inhabited by a mighty People, of which the <HI>Venasars</HI> and <HI>Collers,</HI> the present Inhabitants, are Successors. They joyn themselves with the <HI>Reisboutes,</HI> and commit many Robberies, forcing Tribute from the Inhabitants of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Ballagate,</HI> without being punish'd for the same by their King.</P>
<P>After the King of <HI>Dely</HI> had made these Con∣quests, the <HI>Mogols</HI> took up Arms, and made them∣selves Masters of the greatest part of <HI>Dely.</HI> About the same time there was an eminent Lord of <HI>Ben∣gale,</HI> who, to revenge himself of his King, for put∣ting his Bother to death unjustly, bereav'd him both of his Crown and Life, and afterwards fell into <HI>Dely,</HI> forc'd the <HI>Mogols</HI> to fly, and at the same time made himself Master of all the Country of <HI>Ballagate</HI> and <HI>Cuncan,</HI> extending to the Borders of <HI>Cambaye.</HI> But he not being capable of Govern∣ing so many Countries, and being also desirous of q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iet, resolv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to return back to <HI>Bengale,</HI> and com∣mitted the Care of Governing the Kingdoms of <HI>Decan, Ballagate,</HI> and <HI>Cuncan,</HI> to one of his Ne∣phews, who being a Lover of Strangers, divided those Countries amongst several Lords of divers Nations, as <HI>Arabians, Turks, Rumeans,</HI> and <HI>Cora∣sons,</HI> giving to one whom the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Idalcan</HI> the Country of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Visiapour,</HI> or <HI>Gingive,</HI> lying eight Leagues from <HI>Goa.</HI> He also gave to one of his Captains, nam'd <HI>Nizzamaluko,</HI> the Country of <HI>Siffardan,</HI> which extends it self six Leagues to the North, along the Coast of <HI>Negotana.</HI> He divided the Kingdom of <HI>Ballagate</HI> into Provinces, and gave one part thereof to <HI>Imademaluko,</HI> another to <HI>Coralmaluko,</HI> and a third to <HI>Melik Vervide.</HI> But all these immediately rebell'd against their Lord and Benefactor, and marching to the Metropolis <HI>Beder,</HI> took the King Prisoner, committing him to the custody of <HI>Melik Vervide.</HI> They also procured several other <HI>Hea∣then</HI> Princes to joyn with them in this Conspira∣cy, amongst whom were <HI>Mohade Koja,</HI> and <HI>Veriche,</HI> who possess'd rich Countries, replenish'd with Towns and Villages. <HI>Amohade</HI> got the Cities <HI>Visiapour, Solapor,</HI> and <HI>Paranda,</HI> lying near <HI>Goa;</HI> but not long after the City <HI>Paranda</HI> was taken by <HI>Nizzamaluko,</HI> and <HI>Salapor</HI> fell into the Hands of <HI>Idalcan,</HI> who was also call'd <HI>Sabayo,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord.</HI> He possess'd the Island <HI>Goa,</HI> of which the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> afterwards made themselves Masters. His House or Palace stands yet at <HI>Goa,</HI> but is now con∣verted to a House of Inquisition. The Place ly∣ing between the Great Church and the said House
<PB N="245" REF="174"/>bears the Name of <HI>Sabayo. Idalcan,</HI> who Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1535. was Grandson to one of those fore∣mention'd Kings.</P>
<P>After this Division thus made, there was a Quarrel between <HI>Idalcan</HI> and the King of <HI>Nar∣singa,</HI> his Neighbor; who by his Power subduing <HI>Idalcan,</HI> and the other Kings of <HI>Decan,</HI> made them Tributaries to him: But in process of time <HI>Idalcan,</HI> or his Successors, subdu'd all those Countries which were possess'd by peculiar Kings or Lords, except that of <HI>Melik,</HI> which the <HI>Mogol</HI> had conquer'd.</P>
<P><HI>F. Bernier</HI> relates, That all this great Island of <HI>Hindoslan,</HI> reckoning from the Bay of <HI>Cambay</HI> to that of <HI>Bengale,</HI> near <HI>Jagannate,</HI> and from thence to the Cape of <HI>Comori,</HI> was all, some Mountain∣ous Parts onely excepted, about two hundred years agoe under one particular Lord or King, who was a very great and Powerful Prince: But at present it is divided into many Dominions; and the People are likewise of several Religions. The Reason of this Division was as followeth. A cer∣tain <HI>Raja</HI> or King, nam'd <HI>Ramras,</HI> the last of those which Reign'd absolute in this Country, impru∣dently promoted three of his Slaves to too great Dignities, by making them Governors: <HI>viz.</HI> The first he made Governor of a great part of that Country which the <HI>Mogol</HI> at present possesses in <HI>Decan,</HI> round about <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> from <HI>Bider, Pa∣randa,</HI> and <HI>Surratte,</HI> to <HI>Narbadar:</HI> To the second he gave the Government of all those Countries which are now comprehended in the Kingdom of <HI>Visiapour;</HI> and to the third, that Part which is known by the name of the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda.</HI> These three Slaves growing very Rich and Pow∣erful, and being supported by many <HI>Mogols</HI> which were in the Service of <HI>Ramras,</HI> and of the same Religion with the <HI>Persians,</HI> agreed together to re∣bell against and kill their Lord and Benefactor; which having effected, they return'd into their se∣veral Dominions, each of them taking upon him the Title of <HI>Schah,</HI> or <HI>King.</HI> The Successors of <HI>Ramras</HI> finding themselves not able to engage in a War against these Usurpers, were content to re∣tire and seat themselves in a Place call'd <HI>Carnateck</HI> or <HI>Bisnaguer,</HI> where to this day they Reign as <HI>Rajas</HI> or Kings. The three Slaves and their Suc∣cessors defended their Kingdoms very valiantly, so long as they agreed among themselves, and as∣sisting one another, maintain'd great Wars against the <HI>Mogols;</HI> but when they went about to defend their several Countries, they were immediately sensible of their Division, to their great prejudice, being soon after reduc'd under the Subjection of the <HI>Mogols.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Decan</HI> belong'd formerly to a peculiar King; but is at present Govern'd by one of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Vice-Roys.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogol Akebar,</HI> or <HI>Ecbar,</HI> was the first which conquer'd the Kingdom or Country of <HI>De∣can.</HI> He sent his Son, <HI>Sultan Morad, Anno</HI> 1595. against <HI>Melik Amber,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Decan,</HI> to whom belong'd formerly the City of <HI>Chaul,</HI> who setting forth from <HI>Cambaye,</HI> as being the nearest Place to this Province, was kill'd, with many of his Offi∣cers. After this, in the Year 1598. he sent one of his youngest Sons to maintain the Wars against <HI>Melik,</HI> and revenge the Death of <HI>Sultan Morad:</HI> And soon after he follow'd in his own Person, re∣solving to be present at the Conquest; but he staid about a Year in the City of <HI>Agra,</HI> from whence he march'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 1600. to the Kingdom of <HI>Decan:</HI> But the Queen of <HI>Decan,</HI> who Reign'd at that time, being a Woman of great Spirit and Valour, and being also assisted by the <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> and some great Lords, oppos'd him with so much Courage and Resolution, that many of his People were slain at their entrance into the King∣dom of <HI>Barara,</HI> at a Pass near the Mountains, by which they were to come into the Country of <HI>De∣can:</HI> Yet nevertheless the <HI>Decanyns,</HI> after the death of this Princess, divided themselves into divers Parties, from which proceeded their overthrow and total subduction; for some being corrupted by Money, and others by Promises, they all, upon hopes of greater Employments, contributed their Assistance to the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> in his Conquest of the Kingdom of <HI>Decan.</HI> Having by this means at last added this Kingdom to his Territories, he ele∣cted one of his Sons to be his Vice-Roy, leaving with him a considerable Garrison.</P>
<P><HI>Texeira</HI> says the King of <HI>Decan</HI> was formerly by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Nezal al Malucho,</HI> that is, <HI>The Lance or Spear of the Kingdom,</HI> and also <HI>Ma∣lek,</HI> or <HI>Melik,</HI> which signifies <HI>King. Della Valle</HI> af∣firms that the right Name of the Kings of <HI>Decan</HI> is <HI>Nizam Sciah,</HI> which some translate <HI>King of the Spear,</HI> induc'd thereunto by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Word <HI>Nize,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Spear;</HI> but falsly, because the King calls himself <HI>Nizam Sciah,</HI> and not <HI>Nize Sciah,</HI> as this explanation requires. Others call him, according to the signification of the Word <HI>Nizam, King of Falcons;</HI> for <HI>Nizam</HI> in the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue signifies <HI>A Falcon, or other Bird of Prey;</HI> because this King, before he was made a Gover∣nor, was perhaps Falconer to that Great King un∣der whose Jurisdiction all this Country was; so that he retains that Name to this day.</P>
<P>The King which Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1623. being a Child of about twelve Years of age, gave the Government of his Realm to one of his Slaves, call'd <HI>Melik Amber,</HI> by Extract an <HI>Ambassine,</HI> and of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, who Govern'd with so much Policy, that this Country was more known by the Name of <HI>The Dominion of Melik,</HI> than that of the Kingdom of <HI>Nizam Sciah.</HI> He Govern'd with great Fidelity, and Obedience to the King, and not as some pretended, like a Ty∣rant: Neither did he keep the King as a Prisoner, though it is said by some that he design'd to mar∣ry his Daughter to the young King, that so he might the better hold his Governor-ship, and make his Heir his Successor. He was a Man of great Prudence and Understanding, yet not with∣out the Name of being very wicked, and incli∣ning to Sorcery, of which some affirm he made use to continue himself in his Princes Favor. It is also said, That for the accomplishing his De∣signs he would offer to the Devil several hun∣dreds of Children that were his Slaves, with abundance of other People, hoping thereby the more easily to obtain his Desires. These and other such barbarous Wickednesses and Impieties have been reported of him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Melik Amber</HI> maintain'd at that time great Wars against the <HI>Mogols,</HI> not sparing his own Person, but himself engaging often very valiantly.</P>
<P>It is reported, That this King had a Gun of such a prodigious bigness, that it requir'd fifteen hundred Pounds of Gunpowder to Charge it; that a Man may stand upright in the same; that it is above two Spans thick; and that it cannot be remov'd without many thousands of Oxen, besides Elephants: And though it is not us'd in

<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Ballagate</HI> lieth between and beyond the Mountains of <HI>Gate,</HI> as some Writers affirm. These Mountains are about nine Leagues from the City <HI>Banda;</HI> they are very high, and extend from the Country of <HI>Decan</HI> to the Coast of <HI>Choromandel;</HI> they also reach to <HI>Dabul,</HI> with many Points and Inlets, which render them altogether unfit to be Travell'd over either by Men or Beasts.

<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is by <HI>Linschot</HI> call'd <HI>The Kingdom of Dialcan;</HI> and by others, from <HI>Visiapour</HI> its Metropolis, <HI>The Kingdom of Visiapour;</HI> and by <HI>Della Valle, The Country of Telengone,</HI> or <HI>Telanga.</HI> It takes its be∣ginning on the Sea-shore of <HI>Ingediva,</HI> or <HI>Angedive,</HI> twelve Leagues Southward from <HI>Goa;</HI> or, accord∣ing to <HI>John de Barros,</HI> from the River <HI>Aliga</HI> in <HI>Sintacora,</HI> which is a Boundary between <HI>Cuncan</HI> and the Country of <HI>Canara,</HI> and extends Northwardly to the Land of <HI>Decan,</HI> or the Land of <HI>Siffardan,</HI> a Tract of sixty Leagues: Westward it runs to the Sea, and Eastward to the Mountains of <HI>Gate,</HI> or to the Kingdom of <HI>Bagenael,</HI> or <HI>Golconda;</HI> and is by a Stream separated from the Island <HI>Goa. Della Valle</HI> makes <HI>Telengone,</HI> the Metropolis of this Kingdom, to border Southerly next that which belongs to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in <HI>Goa.</HI> Some reduce the City <HI>Visiapour</HI> and <HI>Goa</HI> under the Province of <HI>Daman,</HI> and place the Province of <HI>Telanga</HI> much further, to the Southern part. The most eminent Sea-Towns are, <HI>Geytapour, Rasapoue, Carapatan,</HI> and <HI>Dabul;</HI> besides which, there are several other very good Bays, Rivers, and Roads.</P>
<P>The Chief City of this Kingdom, the Court and Residence of the Kings, is call'd <HI>Vasiapour, Bi∣zapor,</HI> and <HI>Visipor,</HI> or peculiarly <HI>Vidhikpor;</HI> not∣withstanding <HI>Linschot</HI> places the King's Court at <HI>Solapor:</HI> but it is probable he keeps his Court sometimes at the one, and sometimes at the other. <HI>Visiapour</HI> lies up into the Country about 30 <HI>Gau,</HI> (each <HI>Gau</HI> being three Leagues) or 90 <HI>German</HI> Miles from <HI>Dabul,</HI> and 25 from <HI>Goa.</HI> It is sur∣rounded with high Walls of hard Stone, and deep Moats, which nevertheless are dry in several pla∣ces. Round about on the Walls, and some Plat∣forms made for that purpose, are mounted above 1000 Brass and Iron Guns, some whereof are of an incredible bigness.</P>
<P>The City is built after the <HI>Asian</HI> manner, ha∣ving five Leagues in circumference: It hath five great Gates, <HI>viz. Schanpour, Gurapour, Abrahimpour, Alapour,</HI> and <HI>Bomnenaly.</HI> Before each Gate is a rich Trading Suburb (for in them live most of

<P>Travelling from <HI>Visiapour</HI> to <HI>Dabul,</HI> you pass through these Cities: From <HI>Nouraspour</HI> you come to the City of <HI>Sirrapour</HI> and <HI>Tickota,</HI> six <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Visiapour:</HI> Three <HI>Kos</HI> beyond <HI>Tickota</HI> is the City <HI>Honnowaere;</HI> and three more beyond that, a City call'd <HI>Calesen:</HI> Six <HI>Kos</HI> further is a great and Trading Town nam'd <HI>Atteny,</HI> two days Journey from <HI>Visiapour:</HI> Four <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Calesen,</HI> and two from <HI>Atteny,</HI> between both, lies the Vil∣lage <HI>Burgie;</HI> and two <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Atteny,</HI> the great Dorp <HI>Agelle:</HI> Six <HI>Kos</HI> and a half from <HI>Atteny</HI> is the City <HI>Areka,</HI> with two <HI>Bary,</HI> or Villages, ly∣ing upon the side of the Road, about four <HI>Kos</HI> and a half from <HI>Areka,</HI> and one and a half from <HI>Atteny.</HI> Three <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Areka</HI> lies the City <HI>Berek,</HI> with a small Village in the way, one <HI>Kos</HI> and a half from <HI>Areka,</HI> and is under the Jurisdiction of the City <HI>Mirisdie.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mirisdie,</HI> otherwise <HI>Mirdsy,</HI> is a large and deso∣late City, fortified on the South-west side with a strong Castle, which is so well furnish'd with Men and Amunition, that the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> after the conquering of many Towns and Fortresses, could not subdue this Castle with his whole Army. It is adorn'd with a <HI>Metzid,</HI> built after the <HI>Moorish</HI> manner, in which lie buried two Kings of <HI>Dely,</HI> which died about 500 Years ago; their Graves being adorn'd with Hangings, and other rich Or∣naments, are frequented by the Inhabitants, and travelling People, who shew great Reverence to the same.</P>
<P>Two <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Mirdsy</HI> lies the Village <HI>Epour;</HI> and three <HI>Kos</HI> further, on the Banks of the River <HI>Koecenna,</HI> are two Towns, the one call'd <HI>Great,</HI> and the other <HI>Little Graeen,</HI> about a Cannon-shot one from another. Five Leagues and a half-from the River <HI>Koecenna</HI> is the great and rich Trading City <HI>Asta,</HI> with the Villages <HI>Toncaa</HI> and <HI>Astacka,</HI> in the Road, about two <HI>Kos</HI> and a half one from the other; between which two Villages is a <HI>Barry</HI> or Hamlet. Three <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Asta</HI> stands the large and well-built City <HI>Ballouwa;</HI> and three <HI>Kos</HI> fur∣ther, two Towns, about a Cannon-shot one from the other, call'd <HI>Oerem</HI> and <HI>Jesselampour;</HI> the last of which hath a strong Castle, with high Walls, wherein the Governor for the King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> hath his Residence. Two <HI>Kos</HI> from thence is a Village nam'd <HI>Taffet;</HI> and three <HI>Kos</HI> further, ano∣ther call'd <HI>Cassegam;</HI> and two beyond that, the decay'd City <HI>Caljaer.</HI> Two <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Caljaer</HI> is the Village <HI>Galoure;</HI> and six <HI>Kos</HI> beyond that, the City <HI>Tamba,</HI> and Village <HI>Winge,</HI> near the City <HI>Quelampour;</HI> and another Town call'd <HI>Domo.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Tamba</HI> is large, and well Peopled, built along a Running Water which hath its Ori∣ginal out of the River <HI>Coyna.</HI> Two <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Tamba</HI> is the Village <HI>Morel;</HI> two beyond that, <HI>Sup∣pera;</HI> and four <HI>Kos</HI> further, <HI>Beloure:</HI> two more from hence lies a great Village call'd <HI>Werad,</HI> nine Leagues from the <HI>Ballagatean</HI> Mountains. Not far from this place is the Village <HI>Patan,</HI> formerly the Residence of a famous Robber call'd <HI>Hiewogy,</HI> who forc'd Tribute from all Travellers, which none could hinder him from, notwithstanding all possible means were us'd to prevent it; for so soon as any Forces were sent against him, he immedi∣ately fled into the Mountains, which were natural∣ly inaccessible. Another Village, call'd <HI>Hele∣waek,</HI> lies about three <HI>Kos</HI> beyond <HI>Werad,</HI> by which runs the River <HI>Coyna.</HI></P>
<P>Three great <HI>Kos,</HI> or a League and a half from the River <HI>Coyna,</HI> on the Mountains of <HI>Ballagate,</HI> is the Village <HI>Gatamata,</HI> so call'd in respect of these Mountains; for <HI>Gata</HI> in the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue signi∣fies <HI>A Mountain,</HI> and <HI>Mata, Above,</HI> or <HI>On the top.</HI> Three <HI>Kos</HI> further lies another Village call'd <HI>Po∣ly,</HI> at the foot of the foremention'd Mountains, which by reason of their steep, narrow, and Rocky Ways, are very troublesom to travel. Two <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Poly,</HI> or the Foot of the <HI>Ballagatean</HI> Moun∣tains, is the Village <HI>Combaerly;</HI> and sixteen <HI>Kos</HI> from thence, at the River <HI>Ghaybeer,</HI> a great Vil∣lage nam'd <HI>Chipolone,</HI> from whence is a passage by Water to the City <HI>Dabul.</HI> All Goods that come out of the Country of <HI>Decan,</HI> are carried in Boats from thence to <HI>Dabul,</HI> and so farther up into the Country, which makes this Place to be very po∣pulous, and plentifully stored with all manner of Provisions. The Merchandises and Commodi∣ties which are brought thither by Water, pay for each <HI>Kandy,</HI> or 450 Pound weight, one <HI>Laryn</HI> and a half Freight to <HI>Dabul.</HI></P>
<P>Four <HI>Gau,</HI> or twelve Leagues from <HI>Chipolone,</HI> down the River <HI>Helewacko,</HI> lies the City <HI>Dabul,</HI> or <HI>Dabrul,</HI> anciently very famous, but of late much ruin'd by the Wars, and decreas'd in Trade. It lies in 18 Degrees Northern Latitude, or, as others affirm, in 17 Degrees 45 Minutes, and is built along the Shore of the River <HI>Helewacko,</HI> ten Leagues from <HI>Chaul.</HI> It lies open onely on the South-side which fronts the Water, where are two Batteries planted with four Iron Guns. On the Mountains are several decay'd Fortresses, and an ancient Castle, but without any Guns or Gar∣rison. On the Northern Point, where the Bay begins, stands a little Wood, which at a distance appears like a Fort; and below this Wood, near the Water, is a white Temple, or <HI>Pagode;</HI> as also another on the South Point, on the declining of the Mountain, besides several other Temples and stately Edifices. This City was taken from the King of <HI>Idalcan,</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese, Anno</HI> 1508. but was afterwards won from them again, and ruin'd by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Two Leagues Southward from <HI>Dabul</HI> lies a Pro∣montory or Cape by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Dabul Falso,</HI> that is, <HI>False Dabul,</HI> because in sailing by the same they often find themselves deceiv'd, ta∣king it for the Point of <HI>Dabul,</HI> which it very much resembles. Beyond this Cape is a Bay by them call'd <HI>Enceada de los Brahmannes,</HI> that is, <HI>The Bay of the Brahmines,</HI> because many <HI>Brahmines</HI> dwell thereabouts. Beyond this is the <HI>Ragiaputa,</HI> and
<PB N="248" REF="178"/>the Cape <HI>Caraputa;</HI> the <HI>Enceada,</HI> or Sea-Bay <HI>Ca∣lasi,</HI> or <HI>Calesci,</HI> lying not far from the Cape <HI>Cara∣peta;</HI> and next to that, <HI>Tambona.</HI></P>
<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Dabul</HI> lieth the Bay of <HI>Zan∣guizara,</HI> in 17 Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude. Twelve Leagues from <HI>Zanguizara,</HI> or rather from <HI>Dabul,</HI> and twenty from <HI>Goa,</HI> lies the Haven and Road of <HI>Ceitapour,</HI> in 17 Degrees and 20 Minutes Northern Latitude, behind an Island which secures it from all Winds. This Haven hath at the lowest but three, and at the highest not above six or seven Fathom Water. Beyond the River, three Leagues from this Island and the Road <HI>Ceitagour,</HI> lies the City <HI>Rasapour,</HI> one of the eminentest Towns of the Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan</HI> and <HI>Visiapour.</HI></P>
<P>Travelling from the Sea-side about <HI>Goa,</HI> up into the Country, to the Metropolis <HI>Visiapour,</HI> you pass by and through the following Cities and Villages. First, A great City call'd <HI>Ditcauly,</HI> lying three <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Goa.</HI> Not far from thence, near the River <HI>Madre de Dios,</HI> lies a Castle call'd <HI>Ponda. Banda,</HI> a mighty City, is about one <HI>Gau,</HI> or three Leagues from <HI>Ditcauly,</HI> two from <HI>Goa,</HI> two from <HI>Wingerla,</HI> and three and a half, or nine Leagues from <HI>Balla∣gate.</HI> It is built near the River <HI>Dery,</HI> which glides by this City into the Sea, having broad Streets, with many fair Buildings, and several <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Banda</HI> and the <HI>Ballagatean</HI> Mountains lie several Villages; as <HI>Amby,</HI> two <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Ban∣da;</HI> and <HI>Herpoli,</HI> four <HI>Kos:</HI> Eleven <HI>Kos</HI> from thence, on the other side, at the Foot of the lowest of the <HI>Ballagatean</HI> Mountains, is the Village <HI>Amboly,</HI> be∣yond which, near the River <HI>Herenecassy,,</HI> is ano∣ther Village of the same Name. A Cannon-shot from <HI>Herenecassy,</HI> in the Valley between the Moun∣tains of <HI>Ballagate,</HI> is a Dorp call'd <HI>Berouly;</HI> and two <HI>Kos</HI> further, another call'd <HI>Weseree▪</HI> three <HI>Kos</HI> further, <HI>Outor;</HI> six and a half more, <HI>Berapour;</HI> half a <HI>Kos</HI> beyond, <HI>Matoura;</HI> and one more, the pleasant Village <HI>Calingra,</HI> close planted about with Trees. A Cannon-shot from <HI>Calingra</HI> is the Village <HI>Cangier,</HI> a little beyond a place by a general Name call'd <HI>Bary;</HI> for all those Places which have no peculiar Name, but belong to other Villages, are in general call'd <HI>Bary.</HI> One <HI>Kos</HI> from hence lies the Village <HI>Worry;</HI> and two and a half further, another call'd <HI>Attrowaad,</HI> adorn'd with a <HI>Pagode</HI> built on a Mountain, which may be seen at a considerable distance. Two <HI>Kos</HI> and a half fur∣ther lies the Village <HI>Badaraly;</HI> and as much be∣yond that, the Dorp <HI>Kerwes;</HI> two <HI>Kos</HI> more from which is <HI>Secoery:</HI> Five <HI>Kos</HI> from hence is a <HI>Pagode,</HI> from whence you may plainly see the City <HI>Mirsie,</HI> with its Castles and Towers. Seven <HI>Kos</HI> from the Village <HI>Secoery</HI> lies <HI>Raiabaeg,</HI> a pretty large and Trading In-land City, fortified with a Castle, and belonging properly to the King's Consort: About one <HI>Kos</HI> from the City is a fair Well, and two <HI>Kos</HI> further runs the River <HI>Gagni.</HI> Three <HI>Kos</HI> and a half from this City of <HI>Raiabaag,</HI> is another City call'd <HI>Gotterny,</HI> which hath a Fortification at one of its Gates. A Cannon-shot from thence are two Villages, call'd <HI>Coetesy</HI> and <HI>Omgar;</HI> and half a <HI>Kos</HI> further, the eminent River <HI>Corstena;</HI> one <HI>Kos</HI> and a half from which is the Village <HI>Eynatour;</HI> beyond that, the Dorp <HI>Caterna;</HI> and one <HI>Kos</HI> and a half further, the River <HI>Agery,</HI> with the Villages <HI>Tangely</HI> and <HI>Erary.</HI> Three <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Erary</HI> is the City <HI>Atteny;</HI> and one <HI>Kos</HI> beyond, the City <HI>Bard∣gie;</HI> from whence to <HI>Agger</HI> is three <HI>Kos</HI> and a half more; three <HI>Kos</HI> thence to the City <HI>Talsenge;</HI> and as much from thence to <HI>Hamowaere: Tickocata</HI> lies three <HI>Kos</HI> further, and about six from <HI>Visiapour,</HI> having <HI>Nouraspour</HI> and <HI>Sirrapour</HI> between both.</P>
<P><HI>Tickocata</HI> is an In-land City, provided with a large <HI>Sarry</HI> or Publick Inn for Travellers.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is water'd by several Rivers: <HI>viz.</HI> A little to the Northward of <HI>Goa</HI> is the River <HI>Madre Dios;</HI> and beyond the City <HI>Banda</HI> the River <HI>Dery</HI> falls into the Sea, and is Na∣vigable in small Vessels. Two <HI>Kos</HI> from the Ci∣ty <HI>Kaiabaag</HI> glides the River <HI>Corstena,</HI> which passes through the whole Country of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> to the Ju∣risdiction of <HI>Masilipatan;</HI> about three <HI>Kos</HI> from whence, the Stream <HI>Agry</HI> hath its Course. Be∣tween the two Towns <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Graeen</HI> runs a large River call'd <HI>Coecenna,</HI> on whose Banks those Towns are situate. The River <HI>Coyna,</HI> which signifies <HI>Great Water,</HI> passing through the Village <HI>Helewaek,</HI> hath its Original near the City <HI>Chaury,</HI> lying twelve <HI>Gau,</HI> or thirty six Leagues up into the Country, and extends it self in several Branches beyond the Metropolis <HI>Visiapour,</HI> and the whole Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan.</HI> The River <HI>Ghayhkeer</HI> dis∣charges its Water into the River <HI>Helewacko,</HI> whose Shore is border'd by many Dorps, and planted with <HI>Cocos</HI> and other Trees, very delightful to the Spectators. This River hath its rise out of the Mountains of <HI>Ballagata,</HI> and posses by the City <HI>Eabul</HI> into the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, where it makes a con∣venient Bay. From the North to the South Point, cross this Bay, is a Bank, which at low Water is quite dry; so that those which sail up the River to the City, must pass along close by the South Point. At the entrance is commonly five or six Fathom Water at low Tide. Four Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Dabul,</HI> and thirty to the Northward of <HI>Goa,</HI> glides the River <HI>Zangui∣zar,</HI> by <HI>Barbosa</HI> call'd <HI>Cinguicar:</HI> Its entrance into the Sea is in 17 Degrees and 13 Minutes Nor∣thern Latitude, and makes a large Bay or In-let, with several commodious Roads for Shipping. Next is the River <HI>Bardes,</HI> which runs by a Town call'd <HI>Banda.</HI> The Stream <HI>Aliga</HI> of <HI>Sintacora,</HI> which rises in the Mountains of <HI>Gate,</HI> from thence taking its Course to the Westward, falls into the Sea opposite to the Island <HI>Anchedive,</HI> in 14 De∣grees and a half of Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>The many Rivers and Brooks which flow through this Country of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> make the same very fruitful, especially in the production of Rice, which is sow'd in such Grounds as lie low, and are overflow'd in the Winter: Yet it produces but little Corn; but abundance of <HI>Areka</HI> and <HI>Be∣tel,</HI> especially on the Banks of the River <HI>Betel.</HI></P>
<P>The Fruit <HI>Mangas</HI> growing in <HI>Ballagate</HI> are high∣ly esteem'd, weighing about two Pound a spiece, and are of a much pleasanter taste than those which grow in <HI>Charanna, Quindor, Mandanagor,</HI> and <HI>Dulta∣bado,</HI> and especially those of <HI>Nisamoxa.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ballagate</HI> and <HI>Decan</HI> produce also abundance of Grapes, but inferior to those of <HI>Spain;</HI> and also great Quantities of Cotton and Silk.</P>
<P>There are likewise divers sorts of Stones found in <HI>Ballagate;</HI> as Amethysts, Chrysolites, and He∣mathites, or Blood-stones; and by <HI>Decan,</HI> beyond <HI>Ballagate,</HI> very rich Diamonds are found on the Mountain which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Rocca Velha,</HI> that is, <HI>The Old Rock.</HI> Some of these Precious Stones, which are cut naturally, are in the Country Language call'd <HI>Naiffez,</HI> and are by the <HI>Indians</HI> esteem'd above all others.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="178"/>
<P>By <HI>Ustabado</HI> is a certain Stone found by the <HI>Ara∣bians,</HI> call'd <HI>Hageramini,</HI> and by the <HI>Portuguese Pe∣dra Armenia,</HI> that is, <HI>The Armenian Stone;</HI> because the same sort, being of a blueish green, are found in <HI>Armenia.</HI> The <HI>Moors</HI> make use of them in their Sickness to provoke Urine.</P>
<P>About the Countries of <HI>Ballagate</HI> is a sort of ex∣cellent Varnish: Here are also many Tygers, and Serpents of a prodigious length and bigness.</P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Cuncan</HI> are either <HI>Decangeans</HI> or <HI>Cuncanyns,</HI> and corruptly by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Canaryns</HI> and <HI>Corumbyns;</HI> but be∣sides, there are <HI>Moors, Persians, Benjans,</HI> and other <HI>Heathen</HI> People, which far exceed the Natives in Number.</P>
<P><HI>Linschot</HI> tells us, That the Inhabitants both in Complexion, Constitution, and Clothes, do very much resemble those of <HI>Zurratte,</HI> and the <HI>Benjans:</HI> But <HI>Barbosa</HI> makes them Black, and <HI>Barthema</HI> Sal∣low, or Swarthy. They are naturally Valiant, being for the most part extracted from Strangers; excellent Horse-men, and well skill'd in managing of Elephants: but they are very proud, insolent, and self-conceited. Their Women are much en∣clin'd to Venery.</P>
<P>Their Clothes are either of Silk or Cotton, ex∣cept their Shoes, which are open at the Toes, and lac'd over their bare Feet on the top: yet <HI>Pyrard</HI> saith, That they are Red, sharp-toe'd, gilt, and open on the top. The Women walk with their Faces veil'd, and the Children stark naked, till their seventh or eighth Year. They eat all things without distinction, except Cows, Hogs, and Buffaloes; which Beasts according to an ancient Custom of the <HI>Brahmines</HI> are accounted Holy; nay, they are so superstitiously grounded in this belief, that they sleep a nights under these Beasts, and catch their Dung in their Hands, imagining that thereby they do their Gods great Service. They also abstain from all sorts of Fish. Most of their Houses are built of Straw, with such lit∣tle Doors, that they are forc'd to creep in and out. Their Furniture is inconsiderable; for a Mat spread on the Ground serves them in stead of a Bed; and a Hole digg'd in the Earth, for a Mortar to stamp their Rice in.</P>
<P>There are many Gold and Silver-smiths among them, and also very good Artists in the working of other Minerals, besides many other Handicrafts and Tradesmen, Physicians, Chirurgeons, Car∣penters, Masons, and the like. Every Child is taught the Trade or Calling of his Parents.</P>
<P>The Rusticks maintain themselves with sowing of Rice and Fishing, on which they live very poorly, inhabiting near the Sea-shore, and the Banks of Rivers, for the convenience of the <HI>Coco</HI>-Trees which grow along the same.</P>
<P>The <HI>Decanders</HI> which dwell near the River <HI>Zanguizara</HI> maintain themselves with Tillage and keeping of Cattel. People of more Ability Traf∣fick in Pepper, in which the chiefest Trade of this Country consists, which coming out of <HI>Canara,</HI> is sent by Sea to <HI>Persia, Suratte,</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> They deal likewise in all sorts of Provisions; for this Country is the Store-house for all its Neighbors. The Inhabitants also drive a great Trade in Ca∣lico, and another sort of Cloth call'd <HI>Beirames,</HI> which being brought by Land from <HI>Indostan, Gol∣conda,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Choromandel,</HI> is sold to great advantage; for in most Towns are kept Weekly Markets, to which the Merchants carry all their Commodities, but especially Corn and Provisions, which are generally bought up by a valiant sort of People call'd <HI>Venesars,</HI> and trans∣ported through the whole Country of <HI>Indostan,</HI> which they penetrate with <HI>Cafilas</HI> consisting of three, four, nay sometimes eight or ten thousand Beasts of Burthen, accompanied with Women and Children, which follow them like an Army.</P>
<P>In <HI>Visiapour</HI> dwell many Jewellers, which Trade in Diamonds that come from <HI>Golconda,</HI> and Pearls of a great value. There is also a great Market wherein nothing but Diamonds are sold, which are bought by the <HI>Benjans</HI> of <HI>Surratte</HI> and <HI>Cambaye,</HI> and by them dispos'd of again at <HI>Goa</HI> and other Places. Out of this Country is also carried great store of <HI>Betel,</HI> to <HI>Ormus, Aden,</HI> and <HI>Cambaye.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> of <HI>Goa</HI> drive a great Trade with the Inhabitants of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> but chiefly with the Merchants of <HI>Ditcauly</HI> and <HI>Banda.</HI></P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Raiebaag</HI> dwell many eminent Dealers, which Trade in Pepper and other Com∣modities.</P>
<P>The Coins and Current Moneys of <HI>Cuncan</HI> are of different Valuations, there being two sorts, <HI>viz. Laryns</HI> and <HI>Pagods.</HI> A <HI>Laryn</HI> of <HI>Dabul,</HI> coyn'd of the ordinary Metal, is valued at ten <HI>Pagods;</HI> whereas those of <HI>Persia</HI> make but eight. More∣over the <HI>Pagods</HI> are likewise of a different Value; for some are worth seven and a half or eight <HI>Per∣sian Laryns,</HI> and ten In-land. Their small Money is of Copper, and is call'd <HI>Basarucus</HI> and <HI>Paysas;</HI> two hundred and ten <HI>Basarucus,</HI> and in some Places a hundred and eighty, make a <HI>Laryn;</HI> and twenty eight <HI>Paysas</HI> are of the same value.</P>
<P>Every Town and Village hath for the most part a peculiar Coin and Value on their Money, in which is great deceit, especially in <HI>Laryns</HI> and <HI>Pagods,</HI> which the subtle <HI>Benjans</HI> make so artifici∣ally of Copper and other Metals, that they can∣not be distinguish'd from the good: Wherefore few will receive Money without the presence of a <HI>Xaraf</HI> or Exchanger, who for a small Reward looks over all the Money, and makes good the Damage, if there happens to be any bad Money among that which he receives: And if it be found that an Exchanger so entrusted as is before-menti∣on'd, shall designedly put away bad Money, he is immediately condemn'd to have his Hands cut off, and all his Estate forfeited to the King; notwith∣standing which, they practice it daily.</P>
<P>The Weight of this Country is like that of <HI>Surrat,</HI> having onely some small difference; for twenty seven <HI>Maons</HI> of <HI>Cuncan</HI> make but twenty <HI>Maons</HI> of <HI>Surrat.</HI> The ordinary <HI>Maon</HI> of forty <HI>Ceeres</HI> (a <HI>Ceer</HI> is sixty <HI>Peysses</HI>) is about twenty se∣ven <HI>English</HI> Pounds, with which Weight they weigh all heavy Goods; and with another Weight call'd <HI>Goemy</HI> (each <HI>Goemy</HI> being twelve <HI>Maons</HI>) they weigh their Pepper. A <HI>Quintal,</HI> which is also a common Weight, makes four <HI>Maons;</HI> and five <HI>Quintals,</HI> or twenty <HI>Maons,</HI> one <HI>Candy,</HI> which is five hundred and forty <HI>English</HI> Pound weight.</P>
<P>There are many other Coins and Weights in use among them, which every Person in buying or selling of Goods agree upon at their pleasure; but these before-mention'd are the most common, and generally us'd through all the Country.</P>
<P>The Arms which the Inhabitants of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Visiapour</HI> use, both for Horse and Foot, are broad Swords, Pikes, Lances, with a square Iron at the end about a Span long, Bows and Arrows, Shields, Darts, which they throw with great dexterity at their Enemies: Their Defensive Arms are Coats
<PB N="250" REF="179"/>of Mail, and Coats lin'd with Cotton, which they call <HI>Landa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes.</HI> When they march into the Field, they carry with them Tents of Callico, under which they sleep. They make use of Oxen to carry their Baggage. Their common way of Fighting is on Foot, though when they march, some walk, others ride on Horses, and some on Elephants, of which the King keeps a great num∣ber for that purpose. The King of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is said to be very powerful, and able in a short time to bring eighty thousand, or as some say, two hun∣dred thousand armed Men into the Field, both Horse and Foot: He keeps many <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Mogols</HI> constantly in his Service, which commonly enjoy the most eminent Places under him: He likewise maintains many valiant <HI>Rasepouts.</HI> There are four very eminent Castles or Fortresses in <HI>Cun∣can,</HI> known by the Names of <HI>Ponda, Perinda, Sal∣poure,</HI> and <HI>Bellegam Chapour.</HI></P>
<P>The King hath divers great Guns in his Maga∣zen, and about two hundred Cannons, Demi-Cannons, and Culverins. Round about the City and Castle-walls of <HI>Visiapour</HI> are planted many small Pieces, as Drakes, and the like.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Visiapour</HI> is a Copper Gun of an incredible bigness, its Chamber being large enough to contain above five hundred Pound of Powder: It was found in a conquer'd Castle call'd <HI>Perando,</HI> from whence it was convey'd to <HI>Visiapour</HI> by ten Elephants, fourteen hundred Oxen, and an incre∣dible number of Men. The Founder of this Piece is reported to have been a <HI>Roman,</HI> who un∣dertook the same to make his Name Immortal, and that his Work might be admir'd by the whole World; which is the more talk'd of, because after he had finish'd this prodigious Piece, he kill'd his own Son, and sprinkled his Blood over it for an Offering. It hapned also, that whilst this Gun was Casting, <HI>Braman</HI> the King's Treasurer coming to demand an Account of the Charge from the said <HI>Roman,</HI> he caus'd a Fire to be made in the Pit wherein the said Gun was Cast, and throwing the said <HI>Braman</HI> into it, bid him take an Account of the Fire which consum'd the Silver and Copper. The News carried to the King by the Relations of the Deceased, he seem'd not at all concern'd there∣at, but rather displeas'd with the Complainants, telling them he never gave his Treasurer any Or∣der to demand an Account.</P>
<P>With this Cannon the King took an almost in∣vincible Castle call'd <HI>Salapoure,</HI> making a Breach in the Wall at the first Shot of fifteen Ells long, and at the next, batter'd down the whole side of the Wall; which so amaz'd the Besieged, that without any further resistance they surrendred the Castle. The Inhabitants relate many strange and ridiculous things of this Gun, as that it for∣merly Prophesied like the Oracle at <HI>Delphos.</HI></P>
<P>They speak three sorts of Languages, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Arabian, Persian,</HI> and the peculiar Language of the Country, which differs from that of the other Provinces.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Decan, Cuncan,</HI> and <HI>Gol∣conda</HI> speak the <HI>Persian</HI> Tongue, which at the Princes Courts is as common as their own Lan∣guage.</P>
<P>They Betroth their Children at seven or eight Years of Age, and Marry them at twelve. They keep a continu'd Feast for fourteen days before the Wedding, concluding each day with the sound of Drums and Trumpets. On the Wedding-day all the Relations walk seven times about a Fire made for that purpose, after which they hold the Mar∣riage confirm'd. The Bride brings nothing to her Husband, save onely her Person, and a few Jewels of an inconsiderable value.</P>
<P>They always burn the Bodies of the Deceas∣ed; and if a Married Man dies, the Widow is oblig'd either to cast her self into the Fire with the Corps of her dead Husband, or to live the rest of her days in infamy and disgrace.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is in the Country Lan∣guage entituled <HI>Adelcan,</HI> that is, <HI>The true Gover∣nor;</HI> or <HI>Adel Scach,</HI> that is, <HI>Real Lord,</HI> or <HI>Lord of Justice:</HI> and by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> corruptly, <HI>Dial∣cam,</HI> or <HI>Hialcam;</HI> by the <HI>Netherlanders, Adelchia;</HI> by others, <HI>Cadum Schach,</HI> or <HI>Schach Gean:</HI> He is also call'd <HI>Sabay,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord. Dotexara</HI> call'd that King from whom the <HI>Portuguese</HI> took <HI>Goa, Sa∣byb Adelcan,</HI> that is, <HI>Ruler and King of Justice;</HI> and not <HI>Sabay dalcan,</HI> as we read in History. Accord∣ing to <HI>Della Valle,</HI> the King's Title, besides his own Name, is <HI>Adil Sciah,</HI> or <HI>Idal Sciah,</HI> which, as some render it, signifies <HI>A Just King;</HI> for <HI>Adil</HI> in the <HI>Arabian</HI> signifies <HI>Just:</HI> But others maintain, that <HI>Adil,</HI> or <HI>Idal,</HI> which is an <HI>Indian</HI> Word, signifies <HI>A Key,</HI> and therefore must be call'd <HI>King of Keys,</HI> perhaps from the Office which formerly belong'd to this Prince, <HI>viz.</HI> The keeping of the Keys which lock'd up the Books that containd the Accounts of the Treasures of the Mighty Kings of <HI>Bisnagar</HI> and <HI>Sceherbeder,</HI> unto whom this King and several o∣ther petty Princes were subject, as we have alrea∣dy related.</P>
<P>The King keeps a splendid Court, and when he rides abroad is attended by all his Nobility, and a great number of Horse and Foot, besides many Elephants and Camels, and the sound of many In∣struments.</P>
<P>The Kings eldest Son always succeeds his Fa∣ther in the Government, and maintains his Sisters till they are Married.</P>
<P>King <HI>Adel Schiah,</HI> who deceas'd <HI>Anno</HI> 2586. Great-grandfather to the King <HI>Idelxa,</HI> took <HI>Goa</HI> twice from the <HI>Portuguese;</HI> but seeing at last that his Forces were not any longer able to oppose them, he entred into a League with them, on this Condition, That the <HI>Portuguese</HI> should keep in possession the City and Island of <HI>Goa,</HI> and the ad∣jacent Provinces, <HI>viz. Salsette</HI> on the South-side of <HI>Goa,</HI> with sixty seven Villages; the Country of <HI>Bardes,</HI> with twelve Villages; and the bordering Country of <HI>Tisvary,</HI> with thirty Villages: Pro∣vided that the King of <HI>Visiapour</HI>'s Subjects should peaceably and quietly Trade into all Parts of <HI>In∣dia,</HI> and on condition that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> should not buy any Pepper in any other Place but in <HI>Goa,</HI> upon Forfeiture of their Ships and Goods. But these Articles were broke several times by the Kings of <HI>Visiapour;</HI> yet the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vice-Roy residing in <HI>Goa</HI> as often reconcil'd the Difference, by sending Ambassadors with great Presents to them.</P>
<P>The Father of this present King maintain'd great Wars against the <HI>Portuguese. Anno</HI> 1654. he sent a Letter to the Governor of <HI>Batavia,</HI> the Lord <HI>John Maetzuiker,</HI> desiring him to send a Fleet of twenty six Sail of Ships to <HI>Goa,</HI> to help him drive the <HI>Portuguese</HI> from thence, and afterwards sur∣render the same to his Army. The Letter, by reason of its unusual Stile, will not be amiss to be inserted here. The Contents thereof are as follow.</P>
<PB N="251" REF="179"/>
<P><HI>THE Good</HI> Firman <HI>which are sent to the Per∣son of Honor and Strength; besides Valiant, Famous, and sought after by the Grandees, as the most Eminent Person of your Country, is</HI> John Maet∣zuiker, <HI>Chief Vice-Roy of the</HI> Hollanders <HI>in</HI> India, <HI>who by Friendship and Goodness of the Kings is very much favoured; Makes known to your Excellency, That the Person of Honor, Greatness, and Happiness,</HI> Moelan Abdulakiem, <HI>who sits in the King's Pre∣sence, hath made known to me that you are a Person of a good Nature, and candid Reality, and inclin'd to shew service to this House, which I gladly understood. Send therefore, according to</HI> Abdulakiem<HI>'s Request, a Fleet of twenty six Sail, well Mann'd with valiant Soldiers, and provided with Guns and Ammunition, or at least as many Ships as you can procure, to fight against the</HI> Portuguese <HI>at</HI> Goa, <HI>which Place you must endeavor to clear of those People, and after the Con∣quest thereof, deliver</HI> Goa <HI>to our Army. This done, you shall always remain in our Favor; and 'twill re∣down to your Honor and Glory: And whatever</HI> Ab∣dulakiem <HI>shall write to you concerning it, freely cre∣dit the same, and do that which this</HI> Firman <HI>here re∣quests. Given in the Year after</HI> Mahomet<HI>'s Birth</HI> 1064. <HI>the second of the Month</HI> Sillekada. Accord∣ing to our Stile, <HI>On the thirteenth of</HI> August, Anno 1654.</P>
<P>The King likewise wrote another Letter to the same purpose, to a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant call'd <HI>Leonard Johnson,</HI> to whom also <HI>Abdulakiem</HI> wrote the fol∣lowing Letter.</P>
<P><HI>THE Person whose Strength and Conduct is esteem'd of amongst the Great Ones, is Learned</HI> Johnson, <HI>a</HI> Dutch <HI>Merchant, whose Prudence must continue for ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How long hath your Excellence maintain'd the War of</HI> Ceilon, <HI>with the Expence of much Powder and Shot, and the loss of many valiant Soldiers; which yet remains still unconquer'd, because the</HI> Portuguese <HI>have always fresh Aid come to them? Now to take</HI> Goa, <HI>and to banish the</HI> Portuguese <HI>out of his sight, the King hath made me Commander of his Army, with which I am already come to the Borders of</HI> Salseet. <HI>And since you were formerly enclin'd, when a good</HI> Firman <HI>or Letter was sent to you from the King, to assist him against his Enemies, your good Intentions to serve his Majesty were made known to the King, who thereupon order'd two</HI> Firmans <HI>to be sent away,</HI> viz. <HI>One to the Person of Honor, Eminent, of Great Com∣mand, and Respected amongst the Nobility of your Country,</HI> John Maetzuiker, <HI>Vice-Roy for the</HI> Hol∣landers <HI>in the</HI> Indies: <HI>And the other to your Excel∣lency: Wherein is mention'd, That your Ships being well furnish'd with Victuals and Ammunition, should come hither according to my Directions. And there∣fore I desire you will send your Fleet with all the ex∣pedition you can, well provided with all things, to the Bay of</HI> Goa: <HI>And when we have obtain'd the Victory, and routed the</HI> Portuguese, <HI>we shall consequently in few days be also Masters of</HI> Ceilon; <HI>after which your Valour shall be renown'd in the King's House, you ever continue in his Favor, and your Trade shall flou∣rish in these Countries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If in case you cannot resolve to this Proposal, then consider what Charge you may be at in this War, and what Loss you think you may sustain by it. You will not want much Ammunition in these Countries; there∣fore do not refuse sending Assistance to us.</HI></P>
<P>In the same year, in the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> a Peace was concluded between King <HI>Adel Schiah</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> whereby both Parties were al∣low'd free access one to the other.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> maintains also Wars against some of his <HI>Rais</HI> or <HI>Rajas,</HI> which are <HI>Hea∣then</HI> Princes, or petty Kings, which with the <HI>Ra∣butes</HI> their Subjects reside in the Mountains of <HI>Bal∣lagate,</HI> in Places naturally inaccessible, where they neither fear being surpriz'd nor besieg'd.</P>
<P>They have no Written Laws in the whole Realm; but the King's Will is a Law to all his Subjects. All Civil Debates that happen to arise in the City <HI>Visiapour,</HI> are determin'd by the <HI>Coutewael</HI> or High-Sheriff; but Criminal Causes are try'd by the King himself. The Criminals are often executed in the King's Presence, with great cruelty, throwing them oftentimes before Elephants, and other Wild Beasts, to be devour'd, and sometimes cutting off their Arms, Legs, and other Members; besides other ways not usual in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In other Towns or Provinces the Vice-Roy or Governor passes Sentence after the same man∣ner: For by vertue of their Patents, which they call <HI>Firman,</HI> they are particularly impower'd to give Judgment against Criminals. They com∣monly judge of these Causes according to the first Complaint which they hear; so that he which complains first, for the most part fares best. Dif∣ferences of Debt are soon decided among them; for if the Debtor do not pay his Creditor accord∣ing to the time limited by the Judge, he is severe∣ly whipp'd, and his Wife and Children sold for Slaves by the Creditor. Such Persons as are forc'd to swear, are plac'd in a round Circle made upon the Ground, laying one Hand upon some Ashes brought thither for that purpose, and the other on their Breast, and uttering several Expres∣sions to their Gods; after which, they think them∣selves oblig'd, on pain of Damnation, to make a true Answer to all such Interrogatories as are put to them.</P>
<P><HI>Linschot</HI> makes the <HI>Idalcans,</HI> or Kings of <HI>Cun∣can,</HI> to be Subjects and Tributaries to the King of <HI>Narsinga;</HI> but <HI>Jarrick</HI> affirms them to be mortal Enemies.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Cuncan</HI> were formerly absolute Lords of vast Territories, and subject to none; but about sixty Years ago, in the time of King <HI>Mamedh Idelxa,</HI> Son to King <HI>Ibrahimxa,</HI> who <HI>Anno</HI> 1635. possest the Crown, in the twenty fourth Year of his Age, they were reduc'd under the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI>'s Jurisdiction: <HI>viz.</HI> when in King <HI>Mamedh Idelxa</HI>'s Minority (who Govern'd his Realm un∣der the Guardianship of <HI>Chavas Chan</HI>) the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> assaulting those of <HI>Visiapour</HI> with two hun∣dred thousand Foot, and eighty thousand Horse, for their refusing to pay him Tribute. After a long and bloody War, and the death of <HI>Chavas Chan,</HI> a Peace was concluded, Duke <HI>Mustaff Chan</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Visiapour</HI> brought under subjecti∣on to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> with Conditions to pay nine thousand <HI>Pagods</HI> yearly for Tribute. But at present, as <HI>F. Bernier</HI> affirms, the King of <HI>Visia∣pour</HI> pays no Tribute to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> but de∣fends himself against all Attempts which he makes upon him: for though he be not so powerful as those of <HI>Golconda</HI> oppose the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Forces, yet he hath this advantage, by reason of the remoteness of his Country from <HI>Dely</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> that the <HI>Mo∣gol</HI> makes not such frequent Attempts on these Parts; besides which, that part of the Country of
<PB N="252" REF="180"/><HI>Visiapour</HI> which lies next the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s is very diffi∣cult for an Army to approach, because of the scarcity of Water and Provisions, and the badness of the Ways. The Metropolis <HI>Visiapour</HI> is also very strong, situate in a dry barren Soil, and guard∣ed by many Fortresses, built on the circumjacent Mountains, which are most of them inaccessible. Many <HI>Rajas</HI> also joyn with him for their own secu∣rity. Moreover he oftentimes receives private as∣sistance from the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> who always keeps an Army ready on the Borders, to assist the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> whenever he perceives him to be too much oppress'd by the <HI>Mogol.</HI> Yet never∣theless this State, as also that of <HI>Golconda,</HI> is much declin'd; for the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath taken <HI>Paranda</HI> from them, which is the Key of their Country, with the Magnificent City <HI>Bider,</HI> and some other emi∣nent Places: But especially because of a diffe∣rence between these two Kings; for the last King of <HI>Visiapour</HI> dying without Issue-Male, the present King, who is a young Man, being brought up by the King of <HI>Golcondas</HI> Sister, who took him for her Son, doth not acknowledge her Favours.</P>
<P><HI>Ibrahim Adil Sciah,</HI> who Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1620. notwithstanding the Countries of <HI>Cutb Sciah</HI> or the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> and <HI>Nizam Sciah</HI> King of <HI>De∣can,</HI> lay as Bulwarks between his Dominions and the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s, and upon occasion was able to raise an Army of a hundred thousand Men, stood never∣theless in great fear of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> to whom though he paid considerable Tributes yearly, yet he was so slighted by the <HI>Mogol,</HI> that he sent his Letters to him by a Common Soldier, or Slave, whom he was forc'd to meet with his whole Army, and conduct him in great Pomp to his Court, where he plac'd himself in a Chair of State prepar'd purposely for him, whilst <HI>Adil Sciah</HI> was forc'd to stand in his Presence, like a Slave: And when the Messenger had laid the Letter on a Carpet, he bow'd down to the Ground three times, according to the manner of the Country, before he durst take it up.</P>
<P>This <HI>Ibrahim Adil Sciah</HI> is said to have caus'd his own Son to be put to death, for persuading him from paying the usual Tribute to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> and counselling him by force to free himself from that Slavery.</P>
<P>The King now Reigning sends oftentimes great Presents to the <HI>Mogol. Anno</HI> 1656. in <HI>June,</HI> the King <HI>Sciah Sahep</HI> sent a Present of seven <HI>Lak Penas,</HI> or Two hundred and eighty thousand Pounds, to the <HI>Mogol</HI> Prince <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> (at present King) Re∣siding at <HI>Dautabake;</HI> who then accompanied with <HI>Mirsimula,</HI> lay with his Fathers Army on the Bor∣ders of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> in a Province call'd <HI>Pretapapour.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Venassars,</HI> and <HI>Collers</HI> or <HI>Coulys,</HI> as also the <HI>Rasboutes</HI> of <HI>Cambaye,</HI> pay Tribute to this King.</P>
<P>The thirteenth of <HI>November, Anno</HI> 1656. the King of <HI>Visiapour,</HI> call<HI>'d Adil Sciah,</HI> deceas'd; at which time <HI>Fettechan</HI> guarded the King's Palace; and <HI>Chan Channa</HI> coming with his whole Army near the Walls, desir'd to know of <HI>Fettechan</HI> whe∣ther it would not be convenient for him to bring the Army into the City, to prevent Insurrections: Whereupon <HI>Fettechan</HI> reply'd, That he had taken upon him in <HI>Chan Channa</HI>'s absence to Guard the Fort; and therefore he judg'd it best, for the safety of the Realm, to let <HI>Chan Channa</HI> come into the City: Whereupon he repair'd to <HI>Fettechan</HI> in the Palace, where consulting together, they conclu∣ded to Crown the King's adopted Son, call'd <HI>Cha Chade,</HI> which was perform'd the same day, he be∣ing then in the twenty fourth Year of his Age. This new King receiv'd the Name of <HI>Aly Adel Sciah,</HI> and was permitted to use the King's Grand∣fathers Seal. The right Coronation of their Kings is perform'd at <HI>Chirer Ridder,</HI> a principal Place in the Realm of <HI>Visiapour.</HI></P>
<P>When the old King lay a dying, <HI>Chan Channa</HI> was sent for to him by the Queen, who being come, the Queen told the King, <HI>Here is</HI> Chan Channa; but she receiv'd no Answer. Soon after, <HI>Fettechan</HI> being also call'd thither, the Queen spoke to the King, saying, <HI>The Lord</HI> Fettechan <HI>is also here present;</HI> but the King not answering, lift up his Eyes and departed this life: which when <HI>Fettechan</HI> perceiv'd, he threw himself after many mournful Expressions on the Ground, and shew'd great signs of sorrow.</P>
<P>The young King was committed to the Care and Government of <HI>Chan Channa,</HI> being the second Person in the Realm; whilst <HI>Fettechan</HI> sorrowful∣ly repair'd to his House, where he mourn'd eight days for the King's death, no Man being able in that time to perswade him to come to Court, not∣withstanding the new King had several times in∣vited him: But at last <HI>Chan Channa</HI> sent him word, <HI>That it was then no time to mourn the King's death any longer; That there was a necessity for him to make his appearance before the new King; which if he again re∣fus'd to do, he should be necessitated himself to fetch him, and to bring him before his Majesty.</HI> Upon which Message <HI>Fettechan</HI> made his appearance be∣fore the King, and in all humility fell down at his Feet, but was immediately taken up and embrac'd by the new-Crown'd Prince. The Queen sitting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll this while silent behind a Curtain, at last spoke thus to <HI>Fettechan: Why would you obscure your self in this juncture of time, when your Presence is so much requir'd in all Business? 'Tis true, here wants no Counsel; but we cannot in these dangerous times repose any Confidence in them.</HI> Whereupon the young King added, <HI>You must banish the death of his deceased Maje∣sty out of your mind; I intend to promote you higher, and bestow more Honor upon you than hitherto you have enjoy'd.</HI> Immediately after he gave him the Cane whereby he held his former Offices; which <HI>Fette∣chan</HI> humbly receiving, was presented by the King, as a Testimony of his Favor, with eight thousand <HI>Penas,</HI> which he modestly refus'd, saying, That it was customary the Present should be made to <HI>Chan Channa.</HI></P>
<P>Among several other Persons of Quality, the Lord <HI>Abdullachan</HI> came to Complement the King with a Present of nine thousand <HI>Penas,</HI> and to wish him a long and prosperous Reign: But the King would not accept his Present, telling him, That in stead thereof, he should encrease the number of his Horse. The King likewise commanded all Officers that were unde his Subjection to appear at Court, charging them on forfeiture of a hundred thousand <HI>Penas</HI> constantly to maintain a thousand Horse.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants were at this time in a great Consternation, fearing to be surpriz'd by the <HI>Mogol</HI> Prince <HI>Oranchzef:</HI> But the King causing an Edict to be publish'd, commanded them to be at quiet, and encourag'd them with the hopes he had to lie down in a short time with his Army before <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P>The King professes the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, as also the greatest part of his Subjects; the rest are <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Idolaters,</HI> of which Opinion are the <HI>Canaryns</HI> of <HI>Goa,</HI> the <HI>Naires,</HI> and other <HI>Indians.</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="180"/>They observe several Fasts, and other Religious Ceremonies, like the <HI>Bramans. Linschot</HI> menti∣ons a sort of Religious Persons among them, call'd <HI>Jogues.</HI></P>
<P>In most Parts of the Country reside <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who are permitted to Trade, and enjoy all Privi∣leges, except Religion; yet nevertheless they pri∣vately make many Proselites.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Decan, Visiapour,</HI> and those of <HI>Gol∣conda,</HI> maintain the Religion establish'd by <HI>Maho∣met,</HI> after the same manner with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and are therefore call'd <HI>Soanies;</HI> yet the King of <HI>Gol∣conda</HI> is said to encline to that of the <HI>Persians.</HI> But notwithstanding they are all three <HI>Moors,</HI> and have instituted the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Doctrine in their Countries, yet they still retain many Idolatrous Customs of the <HI>Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Netherland East-India</HI> Company have a Free Trade through the whole Kingdom of <HI>Visia∣pour,</HI> and Store-houses in several Places, the chief∣est whereof is at <HI>Wingurla.</HI></P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Wingurla</HI> lies in 15 Degrees and 17 Minutes Northern Latitude, Northward from <HI>Goa,</HI> and three Leagues Southward from <HI>Ilhas Qui∣madas,</HI> or <HI>The Burning Island.</HI> It hath a pretty large River, which runs some Leagues up into the Country, and is Navigable by small Vessels. At the entrance of this River several Streams of Fresh Water, which come down from the Mountains, fall into the Bay.</P>
<P>The King allows the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> great Privi∣leges, which are confirm'd to them by a Letter dated the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> 1655. <HI>viz.</HI> That they may lawfully claim as their proper Goods all such Commodities or Things whatsoever as shall hap∣pen to be Stranded, coming out of any of their Ships cast away upon his Coast: And they are likewise freed from all manner of Taxes and Im∣positions, as will appear more at large from the following <HI>Firman</HI> or Letter, written to the Lord General <HI>John Maetzuiker.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>GReat <HI>Firman</HI> to all <HI>Honweldares, Tannadares,</HI> and other Inferior Officers, under the Jurisdi∣ction of my Crown, on the Request of <HI>Leonard John∣son</HI> Merchant, who desires, That if any Ships belong∣ing to the Lord General <HI>John Maetzuiker,</HI> which Trade along this Coast, should happen by Storm, Fire, or other Misfortune, (which God forbid) to be Cast away or Stranded near any of my Harbors, nothing might be lost or taken away from them, but all their Goods be deliver'd to them again: Which Request I freely grant them. Therefore I charge you, by vertue of this Letter, that no <HI>Honweldares,</HI> or other Inferior Officers, which have any Command in any of my Sea-Port Towns, shall presume directly or indirectly to keep or detain any Goods or Merchandises which by the casting away of any of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Ships shall hap∣pen to be found Stranded or floating on the Sea; but on the contrary, assist them in the saving of any of their Goods and Merchandize, and freely, without any Mo∣ney, restore such Goods as shall be taken up or found by any of you. He that transgresseth herein, shall be pu∣nish'd, as an Example to all others. I have also re∣ceiv'd lately several Complaints from the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI> concerning the paying of Customs, and the de∣taining of their Servants, of which they were for∣merly freed, and Traded without any Molestation; which is contrary to my former Edict: Therefore I charge all those whom it may concern, a second time, not to demand any Custom or Duties of them, nor trou∣ble them in the least, that I may not have any more Complaints concerning it. And that they may freely Trade without any molestation through my whole Domi∣nions, let several Copies be taken of this Letter, and sent to the respective Places, that this Great <HI>Firman</HI> may be exactly perform'd in every particular.</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>Given at our Court at <HI>Visiapour,</HI> <DATE>the eighteenth day of the Month <HI>Jumandelaer,</HI> in the <HI>1055</HI> Year after <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Death.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
