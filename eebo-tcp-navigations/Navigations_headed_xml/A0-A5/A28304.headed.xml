<HEAD>Reader,</HEAD>
<P>BEing desired by a Friend to set out this following De∣scription of the Province and Bay of <HI>DARIAN</HI> (my Friend knowing that I lived there and thereabouts some years ago) What I have written is both what I have seen and heard in the Place, and I have not perused one word of Mr. <HI>Dampeir</HI> or <HI>Mr. Wafer's</HI> Books; Neither do I know what Description they have given of this <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Dari∣an,</HI> they were both my Ship-maits near six years in the <HI>South-Sea:</HI> I went from <HI>Golden Island</HI> over the Isthumus that se∣parats the <HI>North-Sea</HI> from the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and there I entered aboard of the Ship which they were then in, lying in the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> so that I never did see any of them in the Province of <HI>DARIAN;</HI> For their Ship came round <HI>Cap-Horn</HI> in the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> therefore if that they and I do not agree in our Description, is none of my fault; for what I have written is the real Truth of what I have seen and heard, for the In∣couragement of my Countrey-men.</P>

<HEAD>A Description OF THE PROVINCE and BAY OF DARIAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DARIAN</HI> is a Province lying in the <HI>Isthmus</HI> that sepa∣rats the <HI>North-Sea</HI> from the <HI>South-Sea</HI> in the Latitude of 8 Degrees and 25 Minuts. <HI>North-Latitude,</HI> The Entry of the River lyeth near 30 Miles from <HI>Darian-City,</HI> which is the Metropolitan of it's Province. The Word <HI>Darian</HI> signifies in the <HI>Indian</HI> Speech, a Shady, City or Town. And it was never Conquered by any in Man's Memory; It's called a shadowed Town, because it's Situated betwixt two great Ranges of high Hills, lying on the East and West, and running North and South, with a River called by it's own Name, <HI>Darian River.</HI> And it lying so near the Line, they are not priviledged with the Sun-shine, but at 12 a Clock of the Day, which is near right over their Heads at that time: And then the Reflects of the Sun from off the River and Hill-sides, causes such an extream Heat: But sufferable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Darian</HI> begins from <HI>Cap de Samblas</HI> on the West, and ends at <HI>Cap de Caenu</HI> on the East; this is by the <HI>Indians</HI> own allowance, tho' other Draughts makes it three times Broader. To the North lyes off these Islands <HI>Isle de Pinos</HI> or Isle of <HI>Pinos,</HI> and some other Islands that lyes near to the Shoar, called Isl. de <HI>Orr</HI> or Golden Island. As also <HI>Tortuga</HI> or Tortois Isl. because of the Plenty of
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>these most delicate &amp; wholsome <HI>Amphibius</HI> Creatures for Man's Use; for they participate of Fish, Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, &amp; Fowl, they Swim in the Sea as a Fish &amp; feeds upon Grass that growes upon Rocks, like a Bull or Cow, &amp; they lay Eggs like a Fowll &amp; that incredible Numbers, for I have taken out of an hole in the Sand 300 and oddsat a time. In short it's an excellent wholsome Food any manner of way dressed; I would say more of it were it not known to all to be true, that it would exceed the bounds of thir few Sheets. There is another Island called <HI>Furte,</HI> which lyeth off of the Mouth of the <HI>Le-goun</HI> of <HI>Ʋraba,</HI> which signifieth Safe Anchorage, and indeed so it may be called for 1000 Sail of Ships can Ride in it with much Freedom; There's from 5 to 10 Fathome deep Wa∣ter, with good white chynely ground mixed with white Coryll at the Bottom, in which there is vast variety of se∣veral good wholsom Fishes; But especially that much ad∣mired Creature called <HI>Manaty,</HI> which signifies <HI>Sea-Cow</HI> in the <HI>Indian</HI> Speech, and many other great and small Fishes. The Mouth of this <HI>Le-goun</HI> is about 80 Yairds over, and groweth Wider the further you Sale in it; Its in Form like a <HI>Semi-Circle.</HI> The Word <HI>Le-goun</HI> signifies a Lake or Loch.</P>
<P>All this whole Province of <HI>Darian,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soile.</NOTE> is of a good Strong and fertile Soile and very wholsome, strong bodied People possesse it, which they themselves think, that it's the whol∣somness of the Air and Climate, that makes them such well bodied Men and Women. There is good store of good Water Springs which flow down from off these high Ran∣ges of Mountains in the time of their Rainy Moneths, <HI>viz.</HI> from the middle of <HI>November,</HI> to the middle or end of <HI>Janu∣ary:</HI> And then all the rest of the year is fair pleasant and Serene Weather as can be, but Hot with all, which occasi∣ons their ground generally to be so Fertile; but especially all about the Lake or <HI>Legoun</HI> of <HI>Ʋraba.</HI> For in the time of
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>these Rains all their <HI>Savanas</HI> or <HI>Salinas, id est</HI> Meadows are so over flown with Dirt and Rubbish, which is washed down from the high Mountains, that when it comes to settle u∣pon the low Grounds, it's like to Nilus in a manner: For what they have to Sow or Plant, they do it while the Mud is yet Soft, and in 28 days time, I have seen Mellons, Cu∣cumbers and Gourds and many such like Roots come to Ma∣turity in the said time, which I ever imputed to these Rains and the Reflex of the Sun off of the Water and Hill-sides down upon the Vallies or Meadow Grounds. It's an con∣tinued Summer for all things are Green there all the year o∣ver, Trees of some sort of Fruit will have upon them all atone time, Blossoms budded or set Fruit, and some half Ripe others wind-shaken, various are the Numbers of all sorts of Fruit, Trees, and other stately Trees, for Food and Build∣ing; As also all manner of wild Fowl, especially Turkies and Partriges, Turtle doves, Parats, with various other sorts of Fowles both small and great: As also that smal in∣sect <HI>Cuchaniel.</HI> Here groweth that famous Tree called the <HI>Cocur-nute-tree,</HI> which affords all at one time, Food, Ray∣ment, &amp; all other necessaries fitting for Houshold Use. Here groweth also the much talked of <HI>Cabadge-Tree,</HI> which I have measured when blown down with the Wind, above 100 Foot betwixt the Root above Ground, and the bot∣tom of the Cabadge that grows upon the top of it. Here grows also that much esteemed Nut called <HI>Coco-Nut</HI> of which the Chacolat is made; And here also groweth that Rair and most Fragrant and Odoriferous Apple, called <HI>Pinn-Apple,</HI> which I am sure many of your fine Ladies would give their Silk Gown for one of them to play with a while. In short, I have not now Time nor Bounds, to set down all the most excellent Species of Fruits, such as <HI>Mammi</HI> and <HI>Mammi Suportas,</HI> and <HI>Guovas,</HI> &amp;c. and Roots and other Herbs, which are all very Medicinal as well as wholsome for Food to Man and Beast.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<P>There is likewayes found in these Rivers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Darian</HI> &amp; <HI>Sancta-Maria</HI> Rivers great plenty of Gold-dust, which the <HI>Indians</HI> drains through small Vessels with holes in the bot∣tome of them, in the time of these great Rains. The Gold is washed from the Mines of <HI>Sagra</HI> and the Moun∣tains of <HI>Carabana</HI> &amp; <HI>Guattimala:</HI> Hills in short, it's a Rich Countrey with Gold; for I have been told by very An∣tient Natives of the Place, that they have laughed at their <HI>Southern</HI> Neighbours <HI>Peruvians</HI> who have boasted of their having Houses full of Gold; That their King's Ransom called <HI>Atabalidas</HI> who was taken Captive by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was no less offered for him than an House full of Gold, and if that would not do, they would give for his Ransom four times as much Silver; his House was said to be 22 foot long, 17 foot broad and 36 foot high; yet notwithstand∣ing of all this great boast of the <HI>Peruvians</HI> Gold and Silver. The People of <HI>Darian</HI> laughed at them, and told them that that quantity which they bragged of, was but like a Mouse to an <HI>Eliphant</HI> in comparison of the Mines of <HI>Darian,</HI> which to this hour they say containes in them more Gold than Earth, and I have seen it so in many places my self, when that I lived in <HI>Darian</HI> a few years agoe. As also, I have seen their Horses shodd with Silver Shoes and with Beaten Gold, Bridles with Precious Stones, sett in all the rest of the Furniture, and the Houshold Vessells all of Sil∣ver and Gold. I could Write much more concerning the vast Riches that are there in these places; but I know that my Countrey-men are generally <HI>Thomasses,</HI> or at least I am sure that they would be content to be <HI>Thomasses</HI> by ex∣perience in this matter.</P>
<P>I told you before that the People of <HI>Darian</HI> are a strong well proportioned People, only I forgot to tell you that they are of a Dark-yellow, or Copper-colour, having lit∣tle or no Beards at all, but a straight Rank long Black-hair
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>as Jeat, some of them have it to their middle, others longer, Women to their heels; They Generally go all naked, especially before that they be Married, and but few of the Women kind, unless they are of a higher degree, that ever covers their nakedness, even after they are Mar∣ried; and when that they do it, it's not half covered either, whither it may be imputed to be the <HI>Taylors</HI> fault that takes not a true measure, or the <HI>Merchants</HI> fault that begroudges enough of Cloath, I know not.</P>
<P>The Men are allowed to take as many Wives as he can keep or maintain, and the way of their Marriage is this:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marri∣age.</NOTE> A Man cannot Mary his Sister, or Mother, or Daughter; other degrees of Kindred they respect not, for the Uncles Marie with their Cusings, the more Wives a Man hath he is esteemed the more Worthie, Great and Rich; for when any of them offends him he disposes of her and her Chil∣dren; if that she have any to be Slaves to any who will buy them, and so getts other Goods by the bargain, which likes him better: But Generally all his Wives live very long contentedly together, without murmuring at others en∣joying of their Husbands oftners than others, and after any of them is with Child, she will not ly with her Husband till delivered, nor yet come near Men; But when that they are fit for Men's use, either Maid or Married Woman will not. When that they Marry, the Man asketh the Wo∣mans Friends or Neighbours if that she hath any, asking if that it be their will to let such a Maid or such a Widow Marie or Match with him; if that she say yea, they away they go all to his house, and Solemnizes the Wedding in Eating and Drinking for 3 or 4 days: But at the entry to the House, the Husband gives her an ear of Corn, signi∣fying to her that she must Sow the Ground, and she gives him a Lance, or els a Bow and Arrow, signifying that he must go to the Warrs and Wodes to fight and hunt for his
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>and his Family, then to such Victuals and Drink as they have, which is all sorts of <HI>Jerkt-hogg</HI> that is Fleshed down without Bones. As also, all sorts of <HI>Barbekewd</HI> meats both of Fish, Flesh and Fowl, that is to say, all sorts Rosted. Then for Fruits and Roots of various sorts, they want not plenty of them, as I told you before, and for Drinks called <HI>Muslawhi</HI> it's made of <HI>Plantings</HI> or <HI>Bonano's,</HI> which are Roots not unlike our <HI>Carrot,</HI> only alike bigg at both ends, and a little crooked, these they boyle all to Mash and Strain off the clear and drink it. They have also Drink which is made of <HI>Maiz, Turkie-wheat</HI> and <HI>Casader,</HI> other-wayes called <HI>Farina de Poo,</HI> whereof is made their Meal that they bake for Bread. <HI>Farina de Poo</HI> signifyes Flower or Wheat of Timber, such as hath been Reported long agoe to be sawings of Trees. I could fill a whole sheet of Pa∣per with the vertues and uses of this <HI>Casader,</HI> but however please to accept of what you have here for the time.</P>
<P>Before they go to ly down upon their <HI>Wild-kain-tops,</HI> which is all the Bed that they use, they go and wash in the River, whereon, or near to their Houses are commonly built, and when they are well washed, then they return home and lye down: Their Houses I told you are made upon River-sides for Cleanness and for Air, for they make them generally of an Hutt fashion made of wild Kains set together into the Ground as close as can be, and covered over with the Tops of these Wild-kains for Cleanliness, for they will not discharge Nature upon the Ground, if that they can help it, but run into a River where that it may be carried away with the Current: But if that they be far from a River, then they dig a Hole with a Stick in the Ground, and so cover it up afterwards; They are cleaner about the Doors than many of the Doors at the Cross of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> unless that my Countrey-folks have mended their Manners. The Men generally labour but little in
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>the Fields, but only the Women &amp; old Folks so long as they are able to go alone, the Men are imployed in Hunting and Fishing and Fowling, and making Instruments for War, such as Bows and Arrows, and Lances and such like.</P>
<P>When their Wives bring furth their Children, their Hus∣bands take them from the Womb, and with his Teeth byts their Navel-strings off, and then flatts the Nose of the Child, either by an Squize upon it, or by tying an flat piece of Board or Bone upon it, for they covet much to be plain-faced Gentlemen, &amp; then bores a Hole through the under Lip of it, that through time I have thought that they have had two Mouths, through which I have heard them make an strange sort of an Voice, but the proper use is to hang Gold or precious Stones in it; As also they hang a piece of Gold through the Partition of their Nose down o∣ver the Mouth and Chin, so hath the Woman a great thick Ring of Gold through the same place of their Noses also, so that when they go to War, they attyre all themselves with the richest Things that they have, and when that they Drink they are forced to hold it up with one Finger while the other Hand is at their Mouth; They hang also pieces of Gold at their Hair, and the Men cover their Privies with an hollow piece of Gold which is tyed about their Body witha small Weeth of a Tree, then they Paint their Legs with a certain Juice of an Herb that they call <HI>Pindo,</HI> and as I take the word to be, it should signifie <HI>Paint,</HI> for there∣with they do paint their Legs all over; that in a small time they cannot hardly wash it off; so that I have thought that they had a pair of cliver strait Black boots on their Leggs at a distance, then they oyl all their Bodies, and marches up Man and Woman, Bag and Baggage, to the Place where their King hath appointed an Randezvouze and there pitch their Tents, until that the King pleases to March; ye must know that
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>the Stoutest and Talest Men are made likeways King, and not by Heritage, and the next Talest and Stoutest are Officers under him; again, they come to the Wives and Children, in the time that they are Incamped, those of the bravest and stoutest Hearts amongst them fall a cutting and slashing of their Skine with a Fish-tooth which they keep for the use: The places that they cut are their Brows, Cheeks, Arms, Shoulder-blades, Breasts and Thighs, and some their Hipps, both men and Women; I have seen so Carved with all sorts of Birds, Fowls and Fishes, when their Wounds are bleeding they stop them full of a certain powder, that both dryes and heals these small wounds, and also causes these parts of their Body to swell and rise higher than other places doth, of which they are very proud, because they are taken for valiant and brave Men, then when they are all well, their King Proclames a Speech in this manner, my brave and Stout men, ye'll know that our Fore-fathers were most abominably Murdered, and their Goods taken from them, and their Wives and Children taken captives unto such a Province; Therefore it becomes you all now to prove your selves Brave and Stout Men, in going alongst with me to be Revenged upon them for it; Therefore declare all your minds, upon which they show their willingness by oyling of their Bodies again; so that they cannot easily be catched hold of, and so Bagg and Baggadge follow in order as afore is said; and when that they met within any Bow-shot they all let fly together so long as they have Arrows to shoot, &amp; when all is gone they fall to Work with their Lances and wooden Halbirts Pell∣mell, until some of the sides yeild, and then the Wives fall a Plundering of the Enemies Wives, and in the mean time the Men are secureing the Prisoners, and afterwards they all march Home; and when that they come through any of their Towns, the King cryes out with a loud voice, <HI>Erima,
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>Erima, Toupina-Baults Canomi, Guasione, Tan Tan,</HI> That is, behold what valiant actions we have done for the bring∣ing you these villanous Men that abused our Fore-fathers; shal we not Murder them, Murder them, then the People call out aloud, <HI>Zanupa, Zanupa,</HI> That is to say <HI>furthwith furthwith,</HI> which accordingly they do, some in every Town, until all be killed. The way how that they kill them, is, by tying them fast to a Post, and so Shoots Arrows at them, by degrees, until that they shoot him or her through the Heart, then the women quarters them and gives their bowels to their Children to rubb themselves all over with them, to make them the more Bloody-minded against their enemies, when that they come to be Men, they <HI>Barbikew</HI> their quar∣ters and keeps a Feast in the chief Place of the Town, playing upon Flutts, that either are made of other Dead Mens-leggs, or Thigh-bones, or else the Bones of these present whose flesh are eating at the time. Then when all this Feast is ended, and every Man home to his Family and Peace begins to be Proclamed over all that Province, These Men that are jealous of any of their Wives that have stayed at Home, as many of them do, they get an order from their old Pagels or Priests, to bring her before the People of the Town, where she is set upon an high place above the rest, and then the Pagel asketh her if she be guilty of Adul∣try or not, if that she denys, then he gives her about half a Gill of a certain Red-water, which is as bitter as any Gall, or Wormwood, and gives it her to drink: which if that she be guilty, it will in a quarter of an hours time burst her Belly and rott her Thighs; and if that she be not guilty, it hurts her no more than plain Water would have done, if that she had drunk as much. I would desire that none of my Countrey Women should get any of this Water sent Home as a Propine of their own Colony in <HI>Darian,</HI> for fear it prove their Honesty, as I have it seen done upon
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>them poor Heathens: It looks something like to the bitter Water that we read of in the Law of Jealousie in the Leviti∣cal Law.</P>
<P>When the Children are born and laid by the Mother of it, the Father brings it a little wooden Lance and a little Bow and Arrow with a wooden little Knife and Kisses him if a Son, saying unto him, my Son, when that thou art great, thou must be strong to revenge thy self upon thy Enemies. They have divers names for their Children, such as <HI>Orapoe∣cen,</HI> that is Bow and Arrow, <HI>Sarigoy,</HI> that is four footed Beast, <HI>Arignan,</HI> that is an Hen, <HI>Araboton,</HI> that is an <HI>American</HI> Tree, <HI>Pindo,</HI> that is an Herb they paint withall, as ye heard before. The Mother gets a drink of <HI>Muslawhi</HI> or two, and Crambs the <HI>Pickaninis</HI> Mouth, that is to say the little ones Mouth, with some boyled Root or other, and then gives it Suck for to wash it down with all and takes a small Weeth or Bark of a Tree, tying the Child to her back, &amp; casts o∣ver her Shoulder, which Pape or Breast she places that whereat the Infant may Suck at its pleasure; and so she goes about any Bussiness that she has to do either about their House or in the Fields, They are truly brave Nurses, for tho' that there Children are never Swadled, yet there is none amongst them either young or old that ever I saw Crooked or Deformed, which I impute to the strength of the Mothers Milk, I have had Children of my own Nursed by these <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and they take it as a great favour done to them, to let them give Suck to our Children, which they have done many times when that I lived in <HI>America.</HI> As their Chil∣dren grows up they teach them how to make Bows and Ar∣rows, Lances and such like Tools for to fight their Enemies with all, as you have heard already the way how that they fight, and how that the use their Prisoners.</P>
<P>They Hunt with several sorts of Arrows according as they design their Sport, some small and sharp pointed with
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>a Fish Tooth, others bigger and blunt at the end like to a Rammer, and that is to Stun or Stupifie certain Creatures that that they keep about their House, after that they re∣cover Breath again. I have seen them shoot an Arrow 50 paces even out from them, and make it stick in a Beasts Head or Mans Head if in time of War. They go a Fish∣ing in small <HI>Dores</HI> or <HI>Cannous</HI> or <HI>Barkloggs,</HI> or sometimes upon Blown &amp; dressed Selh's skins tyed together, with which they go oft to Sea; and shoots with their Arrows some sorts of Fish, and others they strick with their <HI>Harpoon Irons</HI> and so when they are Loaden, they come home and de∣livers their Fishes to the Women, who dresses them accor∣ding as they have occasion, and that is various ways for their own use, and also to keep to complement Strangers with all when that they come amongst them, as I may self have been, especially near to the City <HI>Darian,</HI> where we had several Dishes of the aforementioned <HI>Tortoisses</HI> and <HI>Manaty</HI> with several other rare Fishes and Fowls, which are very plenty near to the Lake or Loch or <HI>Le-goun</HI> of <HI>Ʋ∣raba.</HI></P>
<P>I have spoken with old men that have described to me a great Fowl in shape like the <HI>Griffen,</HI> but they are all ba∣nisht of late years; As also are all the Lyons, Tygers, Le∣opards and Bears that used to haunt the Mountains, and in sted of them, there is great plenty of all sorts of Munkies, &amp; delicat Fowls as is aforementioned, which Munkies are very good Meat to them that know them, I have eaten 40 times of them, and would do it yet, before I would eat Mager or Lean-flesh.</P>
<P>They are generally kind to all Strangers except <HI>Spaini∣ards,</HI> whom they hate with a perfect hatred, as they have good cause to do, considering their horrid and inhumane Murder that they committed upon these poor silly harmless <HI>Heathens:</HI> It's not many Years ago since I saw upon the
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>Coast of <HI>Peru</HI> 100 Carcages of murdered <HI>Indians</HI> turned in∣to Mumy, tho' a long time since; These sandy hot Coun∣treys keeps their Carcages from consuming; I call them Car∣cages because they are lying like as many dead dryed Sheep, only they want the Wool that Sheep bear in these parts of the World: But I will not talk of <HI>Peru</HI> till I have fini∣shed the History of <HI>Darian.</HI> I say that they are kind to Strangers, for if that they know that you are designed to go up the Countrey, they will carry you in Ham makers up∣on their shoulders with two Men one on each side of you, carrying Water or Wine and Fire and Tobacco, if that you have occasion for either of them, and when that ye come to the Place where their King or chief Man liveth, ye are made welcome by him and all the rest of his Court, by hugging of you in their Arms, and scratching of your Back or Shoulders with their Fingers, the which you must do the like to them, then you are set down upon a Straw∣matt, or some such like thing by the King, or next best Man to him, and if that you have an Interpreter to acquaint them with your Business, they will all hear him, or your self if that you can speak the Language, until that you have made an end, and then the King tells it to all his Court round about him, which if that it be a thing that pleases him, he claps his right Hand a cross his Heart, and gives two or three Nods with his Head, which all signifie he likes the News or your Discourse with his Heart, and so if that he do not like it, shakes his Head and looks of a sower Countenance, and crys out aloud <HI>Zeto patae,</HI> id est, <HI>I am not well pleased;</HI> But if that he is well pleased, then he crys aloud <HI>Yatabala Comorada,</HI> that is, <HI>ye are welcome to him as a Friend;</HI> and so in confirmation of this he drinks to you, clapping his Heart first, and afterwards takes you by the Hand, and Drinks to you, that is a sign that ye are as wel∣come to him as his Heart, and so ye drink all round in this
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>Fashion till it comes to the King again, and then to Victuals ye go, to such as I have spoken of already, and the way of dressing of it. And farder to, to complement you with the Kindness, they give you either their own or their Wifes Sister to wait upon you while that you stay in Countrey, which if you except of them, it is taken by them as an ex∣traordinary piece of Favour conferred upon the Family in accepting of their Relation; ye may use her if that you please, which if that you do, I am sure it must either be for rarities Cause, or else extream Necessity.</P>
<P>But be sure that you take her not with you when that you return either to your Store-house, or yet a Shipboard, by conveying her secretly away as some hath done, to the great Damage of these that may perhaps come into the same Place for Trade, as I knew it once fall out not many years ago; But that if ye leave her with them, as also a few Beeds or such like Toyes, then besure that they shall convoy you down in State, with Musick before you, and some of the best of the Place will go at your side, and others holding an <HI>Subumbrera</HI> (as the <HI>Spainiards</HI> call it) over your Head, o∣thers carrying <HI>Palm-wine</HI> and <HI>Tobacco;</HI> for fire they can make it out of a green and dry Stick by Frixation present∣ly to you, if need require.</P>
<P>When that ye are come home either to the Store-house or the Ship ye cause compliment those that conveyed you down with Beeds, Coper or Brass-Rings, and Whistles of all sorts a few of them, and they will return you 1000 times the worth of it either in Gold or in Silver, besides what Provisions of <HI>Barbekewed-Fish</HI> and Flesh they will send down to you.</P>
<P>At your departure from them, ye must shake hands and scart their Back as I told you before; and then they will cry out <HI>Zata faca Balla Comerada,</HI> that is, <HI>many bold and hearty success to you my Friend;</HI> so away they march home and show all their Wealth they have gotten from you. If ye have given them any small Looking-Glasses, that is two or three days Work for them to behold their beautiful Faces into, and sometimes looking upon the back side of the
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>Glass, to see if the Party be there that they saw in the fore∣side of the Glass.</P>
<P>Now for their Religion, you must know that all the Heathens in these Parts, have some sort of a god or other that they worship; either for fear of Love, <HI>viz.</HI> There is a <HI>Palm-tree</HI> which affords them Wine every day: and there is a Root that they call <HI>Api</HI> they worship, because its good for to make Bread of. There is the Sun and Moon, be∣cause they receive Light from them. Next, there is the Devil they worship in various Shapes, as they have told me; they see their <HI>Valasa,</HI> that is, <HI>their great Prophet,</HI> some∣time in a Mans Shape, sometimes in a Beasts, and other times in a Birds Shape. There is a Fish that they call <HI>Cay∣man,</HI> that is a <HI>Crocadoil</HI> or <HI>Allagator;</HI> and there are <HI>Snails</HI> and <HI>Serpents</HI> of all sorts that they worship also. I could in∣sist to 10 Sheets of Paper upon their way of Worship, and how often in the year, and also what Harm comes to them that by Chance kill either of these gods: but wanting time, I shall forbear till the next Occasion.</P>
<P>There is one thing I cannot omit, That I have seen some sorts of them that can neither comprehend an Oath, nor yet a Lye; though I have demonstrat both to them, they would tell that it is impossible that any thing that looks like a Man, can be guilty of either.</P>
<P>Their way of Swearing, is either by their Fathers or Mo∣thers back-side; or if it be a great and deep Oath, then they swear by their Grandfathers; and if no body will believe the Truth that they are saying, then they swear by their great Grandfathers and Mothers back-side. But as for Lyeing, I never could get them to comprehend it. This way of Swearing they tell me hath been ever with them: I think it looks something like <HI>Abrahams</HI> making of his Ser∣vant put his Hand under his Thigh when he was going a Wooing of a Wife for his Son. Yet this sort of them, are they that worship the Devil.</P>
<P>They have no way of Learning amongst any of them: their way of numbering anything, is by small Stones, or
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>pickles of great Corn; and they keep those that they have compted by them, till Occasion calls for them.</P>
<P>Their Ages they keep, or compt by so many Moons; they have no Names for the Months. I have reckoned up so many Moons, as that hath come to 105, and 110; yea, some 120 years old, and brisk old Men, notwithstanding which, I impute to the wholesomeness of the Countrey of <HI>Darian.</HI></P>
<P>There is others of them that believes the Resurrection of the Body; because I have seen of their Graves that have been accidentally opened; and these of their Friends have gone and taken all their Bones and carried them Home, and put them in a place where that they would ly safe: I have ask∣ed them the Reason of it; they would tell me that he would have occasion for them, when he should rise to go behind the great High-hill where all the brave and strong Men goe; and these that are not brave and strong men, when they Rise, they go to a dark Cave, and there neither hear, nor see the brave Singing and Dancing, that they that go be∣hind the high Hill see, hear and act also: but shall stay in that place till one <HI>Agga</HI> shall come and beat his Bones to pieces. <HI>Agga,</HI> that is, <HI>an evil or bad man.</HI></P>
<P>Their Physicians they call <HI>Paggies,</HI> plays the Rogue much with them, for they know certain Herbs and Gumms, that when they please to tell them that they are sick in such a part of their Body, that they apply a Blistering Plaster to it, which immediatly blister their Flesh, and as soon they will heal it, by applying of a certain Gumm, of which there is great Store of all sorts, both of Herbs, Oyls and Gumms in this Province of <HI>Darian;</HI> I have seen the Effects of se∣verals of them tryed to admiration.</P>
<P>Their Diseases are generally <HI>Calentures, Fluxes</HI> and <HI>Yeas,</HI> or that we call the <HI>Clap,</HI> at which they are very dextrous, in curing in 24 Hours time, by a certain Root they give inwardly for that Effect.</P>
<P>When they are lying on Death-bed, their Friends Dance Sing and Roar all the time Night and Day, and the sick Person takes it as a great piece of Kindness done to him to
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>attend him in this manner. But as soon as he is dead, they howl and mourn with extreme Howlings, especially if he was a man of Esteem amongst them, or yet a brave strong man. Also the old Women cryes out, O what a lusty and strong and cunning Hunter and Fisher this <HI>Ehu</HI> (that is man) was! Thus they continue for six Hours time untill he be buried, for they keep none in these parts longer than six Hours time, and they bury them in a deep Hole upright putting in above him Fowls Feathers of various Colours to deck his Lance and weapons of VVar with, when he shall go to the back of the Hill and Dance with the rest of the brave men that are gone before him: Also they power a∣bout him some Palm wine and set a staff before him, and some Tobacco and Pipes, then they desire him to mind them to such and such as are gone before him to Dance at the back of this great Hill, and they put the Earth about him, and returns with a Lamentation, Crying out, O this strong <HI>Ehu</HI> is gone! who will bring us now the Bodies of our E∣nemies to eat as he used to do; Thus they continue to mourn for a VVeeks time.</P>
<P>Thus far I have given you a true and Real Discription of the Province of <HI>Darian,</HI> both as to the People and their Customs and Ceremonies; as also the nature of the Soil, with the Production thereof: If that it be kindly accep∣ted, I shall give you a Map of the whole Province with all the Rivers and Villages, with a fuller Discription than a∣ny extant.</P>
<P>I would have put furth a Map of <HI>Darian</HI> with it's ad∣jacent Places; but knowing that there are many who will not understand a Map, that can understand a Printed Des∣cription, especially of the Province where now <HI>New-Edin∣burgh</HI> is stated in <HI>Cal donia.</HI></P>
<P>But knowing that some People are like Children, who love to play with bony Pictures; they shal be pleased within a small time with a Map containing all the varities of the Place, the shapes of Men and Women, Beasts and Birds, Fruits and Trees.</P>
