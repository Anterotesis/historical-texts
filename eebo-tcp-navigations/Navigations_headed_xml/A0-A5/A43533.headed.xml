<HEAD>FRANCE Painted to the Life. The First Book. The beginning of our Journey, the nature of the Sea, a Farewell to <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N Thursday the 28th of <HI>June,</HI> at the time when <HI>England</HI> had recei∣ved the cheif beauty of <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had seen the cheif beauties of <HI>England,</HI> we went to Sea in a Bark of <HI>Dover</HI>; The Port we arrived at <HI>Diepe</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> the hour three in the afternoon: the wind fair and high▪ able, had
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
it continued in that point, to have given us a waft∣age as speedy as our longing. Two hours before night it came about to the Westward, and the tide also not befriending us, our passage became tedi∣ous and troublesome. The next day being dedi∣cate to the glory of God, in memory of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> we took the benifit of the ebb to assist us against the wind. This brought us out of the sight of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and the floud ensuing compelled us to our an∣chor.</P>
<P>I had now leisure to see <HI>Gods wonders in the deep,</HI> wonders indeed to us, which had never before seen them: but too much familiarity had made them none other than the Saylers play-fellows. The waves striving by an inbred ambition which should be the highest, which foremost: precedency and super-eminency was equally desired, and each en∣joyed it in succession. The wind more covetous in appearance to play with the water than disturbe it, did onely rock the billow, and seemed indeed to dandle the Ocean. You would at another time have thought, that the Seas had onely danced at the Winds whistle, or that the Wind straining it self to a treble, and the Seas by a disdiapason supply∣ing the base, had tuned a Coranto to our Ship. For so orderly we rose and fell, according to the time and note of the billow, that her violent agitation might be thought to be nothing but a nimble Gal∣liard filled with Capers. The nimbleness of the waves, and correspondency of our Bark unto them, was not to all our company alike pleasing: what in me moved onely a reverend and awful pleasure, was to others an occasion of sickness:
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
their heads giddy, their joynts enfeebled, their stomacks loathing sustenance, and with great pangs avoiding what they had taken▪ In their mouthes nothing so frequent, as that of <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><L>— Illi robur &amp; aes triplex</L>
<L>Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci</L>
<L>Commisit pelago ratem.</L>
<L>Hard was his heart as brass, which first did ven∣ture</L>
<L>In a weak Ship on the rough Seas to enter.</L></Q>
Whether it be that the noisom smels which arise from the saltness and tartness of that Region of waters, poisoneth the brain? or that the ungo∣verned and unequal motion of the Ship stirreth and unsettleth the stomack, or both? we may conje∣cture with the Philosphers rather than determine. This I am sure of, that the Cabbins and Deck were but as so many Hospitals or Pest-houses filled with diseased persons: whilst I and the Marriners one∣ly made good the hatches: here did I see the sca∣ly Nation of that Kingdom solace themselves in the brim of the waves, rejoycing in the light and warmness of the day, and yet spouting from their mouthes such quantity of waters, as if they had purposed to quench that fire which gave it. They danced about our vessel, as if she had been a mo∣ving May-pole; and that with such a delightful <HI>de∣corum,</HI> that you never saw a Measure better troaden with less art: And now I know not what wave bigger than the rest▪ tossed up our Ship so high, that I once more ken'd the coast of <HI>England</HI>; an object
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
which took such hold on my senses, that I forgot the harmless company which sported below me, to bestow on my dearest Mother this (and for ought I could assure my self, my last) <HI>Farewell.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>England</HI> adiew: thy most unworthy Son</L>
<L>Leaves thee, and grieves to see what he hath done;</L>
<L>What he hath done in leaving thee, the best</L>
<L>Of Mothers, and more glorious than the rest,</L>
<L>Thy sister Nations. Had'st thou been unkind:</L>
<L>Yet might he trust thee safer than the Wind.</L>
<L>Had'st thou been weak: yet far more strength in thee,</L>
<L>Than in two inches of a sinking Tree.</L>
<L>Say thou wert cruel? yet thy angry face</L>
<L>Hath more love in it, then the Seas embrace.</L>
<L>Suppose thee poor! his zeal and love the less,</L>
<L>Thus to forsake his Mother in distress.</L>
<L>But thou art none of those: No want in thee,</L>
<L>Onely a needless Curiositie,</L>
<L>Hath made him leap thy Ditch. O let him have</L>
<L>Thy blessing in his Voyage, and hee'l crave</L>
<L>The Gods to thunder wrath on his neglect,</L>
<L>When he performs not thee all due respect:</L>
<L>That <HI>Nemesis</HI> on him her scourge would pluck,</L>
<L>When he forgets those breasts wich gave him suck:</L>
<L>That Nature would dissolve and turn him earth,</L>
<L>If thou bee'st not remembred in his Mirth.</L>
<L>May he be cast from Mankind, if he shame</L>
<L>To make profession of his Mothers name.</L>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Normandy</HI> in general, the Name and bounds of it, The condition of the ancient <HI>Nor∣mans,</HI> and of the present. <HI>Ortelius</HI> Cha∣racter of them examined. In what they re∣semble the Inhabitants of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> The Commodities of it, and the Government.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe next ebb brought us in sight of the sea-coast of <HI>Normandy,</HI> a shoar so evenly compo∣sed and levelled, that it seemeth the work of Art not Nature, The Rock all the way of an equal height, rising from the bottom to the top in a per∣pendicular, and withal so smooth and polished, that if you dare beleive it the work of Nature, you must also think that Nature wrought it by the line, and shewed an art in it, above the imitation of an Artist; This wall is the Northern bound of this Province; the South part of it being confined with <HI>Le-Maine la Beausse &amp; l' Isle du France.</HI> On the East it is divided from <HI>Picardy</HI> by the River of <HI>Some,</HI> and on the West it is bounded with the O∣cean, and the little River <HI>Crenon</HI> which severeth it from a corner of <HI>Britain.</HI> It extendeth in length from the beginning of the 9th degree of longitude to the middle of the 23. <HI>viz.</HI> from the <HI>Cape</HI> of St. <HI>Saviour</HI> West, to the Port town of St. <HI>Valeria</HI> East. For breadth it lieth partly in the 49th partly in the 50th degree of latitude. So that reckoning 60. miles to a degree, we shall find it to contain 270.
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
English miles in length, and 60 English miles in breadth where it is narrowest.</P>
<P>Amongst the Nations it was accounted a part of <HI>Gallia Celtica,</HI> the name <HI>Neustria.</HI> This new title it got by receiving into it a new Nation. A peo∣ple that had so terribly spoiled the Maritine Coasts of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Belgia,</HI> that <HI>a furore Normannorum</HI> was inserted into the <HI>Letany.</HI> Ori∣ginally they were of <HI>Norway,</HI> their name importeth it: <HI>Anno</HI> 800. or thereabouts they began first to be accounted one of the plagues of <HI>Europe:</HI> 900. they seated themselves in <HI>France</HI> by permission of <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Balde,</HI> and the valour of <HI>Rollo</HI> their Captain. Before this they had made themselves Masters of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though they long held it not, and <HI>Anno</HI> 1067. they added to the glory of their name by the Conquest of <HI>England.</HI> You would think them a people not onely born to the warrs, but to victory. But <HI>Ʋt frugum semina mutato so∣lo degenerant, sic illa genuina feritas eorum amaeni∣tate mollita est. Florus</HI> spake it of the <HI>Gaules</HI> re∣moved into <HI>Asia,</HI> it is appliable to the <HI>Norwegians</HI> transplanted into <HI>Gallia</HI>; yet fell they not sudden∣ly and at once into the want of courage, which now possesseth them. During the time they con∣tinued <HI>English,</HI> they attempt the Kingdom of <HI>Na∣ples</HI> and <HI>Antioch</HI> with a fortune answerable to their valour. Being once oppressed by the <HI>French,</HI> and inslaved under that Monarchy, they grew pre∣sently Crest fall'n, and at once lost both their spi∣rits and their liberty.</P>
<P>The present <HI>Norman</HI> then is but the corruption of the ancient: the heir of his name, and perhaps
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
his possessions; but neither of his strength nor his manhood: Bondage and a fruitful soil hath so e∣masculated them, that it is lost labour to look for <HI>Normans</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> There remaineth almost nothing in them of their Progenitors but the re∣mainders of two qualities, and those also degene∣rated, if not bastards; a penurious pride, and an ungoverned doggedness: Neither of them become their fortune or their habit, yet to those they are constant. Finally, view him in his rags and de∣jected countenance, and you would swear it im∣possible, that those snakes should be the descen∣dents of those brave <HI>Heroes</HI> which so often trium∣phed over both Religions, foyling the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and vanquishing the <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>But perchance their courage is evaporated into wit, and then the change made the better. <HI>Ortelius</HI> would seem to perswade us to this conceit of them, and well might do it, if his words were Oracle. <HI>Le Gens</HI> (saith he, speaking of this Nation) <HI>sont de plus accorls, &amp; subtills d' esprit de la Gaule.</HI> A Character for which the French will little thank him, who (if he speak truth) must in matter of descretion give precedency to their vassals. But as <HI>Imbat</HI> a French Leader said of the <HI>Florentines</HI> in the fifth book of <HI>Guicciardine, Non supena done con∣sistesse lingeque tanto celebrare de Fior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntini,</HI> so may I say of the <HI>Normans</HI>: for my part I could never yet find, where that great wit of theirs lay. Cer∣tain it is, that as the <HI>French</HI> in general are termed the <HI>King's asses:</HI> so may these men peculiarly be called the <HI>Asses of the French,</HI> or the veriest Asses of the rest. For what with the unproportionable
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
rents which they pay to their Lords on the one side, and the immeasurable taxes laid upon them by the King on the other; they are kept in such a perpetuated course of drudgery, that there is no place for wit or wisdom left amongst them. Liber∣ty is the Mother and Nurse of those two qualities; and therefore the <HI>Romans</HI> (not unhappily) ex∣pressed both the condition of a Free-man and a discreet and modest personage by this one word <HI>Ingenuous.</HI> Why the <HI>French</HI> King should lay a greater burden upon the backs of this Nation, than their fellows, I cannot determine. Perchance it is because they have been twice conquered by them (once from King <HI>John,</HI> and again from <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth) and therefore undergo a double servitude. It may be to abate their natural pride and stub∣bornness. Likely also it is, that being a revolting people, and apt to an apostasie from their Allegi∣ance, they may by this meanes be kept impoverish∣ed, and by consequence disabled from such practi∣ses. This a French Gentleman of good under∣standing told me, that it was generally conceited in <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>Normans</HI> would suddenly and unanimously betray their Country to the <HI>English,</HI> were their King a <HI>Cath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>like.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a further cause yet of their beggar∣liness and poverty, which is, the litigiousness and frequent going to law (as we call it:) <HI>Ortelius,</HI> however he failed in the first part of the Chara∣cter, in the conclusion of it hath done them justice. <HI>Mais en generall</HI> (saith he) <HI>its sont scavans an passible en prosses &amp; pluideries.</HI> They are pretty well versed in the querks of the Law, and have wit more than enough to wrangle.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7"/>In this they agree exactly well with the Inhabi∣tants of our Country of <HI>Norfolke. Ex infima plebe non pauci reperiuntur</HI> (saith Mr. <HI>Cambden) qui, si nihil sit litium, lites tamen ex ipsis jaris apicibus se∣rere callent.</HI> They are pretty fellows to find out quirks in Law, and to it they will, whatsoever it cost them. Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> spake not at random, or by the guess: for besides what my self observed in them at my being once among them in a <HI>Colledge-progress</HI>; I have heard, that there have been no less than 340. <HI>Nisi prius's</HI> tried there at one <HI>Assises.</HI> The reason of this likeness between the two Na∣tions, I conjecture to be, the resemblance of the site and the soyl: both lie upon the Sea, with a long and spacious coast, both enjoy a Country champain, little swell'd with hils, and for the most part, of a light and sandy mould. To proceed to more particulars, if there be any difference be∣tween the two Provinces, it is onely this, that the Country of <HI>Normandy</HI> is much better, and the people of <HI>Norfolk</HI> are somewhat the richer.</P>
<P>For indeed the Country of <HI>Normandy</HI> is enrich∣ed with a fat and liking soil, such a one, <HI>quae demum votis respondet avari Agricolae,</HI> which may satisfie the expectation of the Husbandman, were it never so exorbitant. In my life I never saw Corn-fields more large and lovely extended in an equal level, almost as far as eye-reach. The wheat (for I saw little Barley) of a fair length in the stalk, and so heavy in the ear, that it even bended double, you would think the grain had a desire to kiss the earth its Mother; or that it purposed by making it self away into the ground, to save the Plow-man his
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
next years labour. Thick it groweth, and so per∣fectly void of weeds, that no garden can be ima∣gined to be kept cleaner by art, than these fields are by nature. Pasture ground it hath little, and less meadow: yet sufficient to nourish those few Cat∣tel they have in it. In all the way between <HI>Diepe</HI> and <HI>Pontois,</HI> I saw but two flocks of Sheep, and then not above forty in a flock. Kine they have in some measure, but not fat, nor large: without these, there were no living for them. The Noblest eat the flesh, whiles the Farmer feeds on Butter and Cheese, and that but sparingly. But the miserable states of the <HI>Norman paissant,</HI> we wiil deferre till another opportunity. Swine also they have in pretty number, and some Pullen in their backsides, but of neither an excess. The principal Rivers of it is <HI>Seine,</HI> of which more hereafter, and besides this I saw two rivulets, <HI>Robee</HI> and <HI>Renel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI></P>
<P>In matter of civil Government this Country is directed by the Court of Parliament established at <HI>Roven</HI>: for matters Military it hath an Officer like the Lieutenants of our Shires in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Go∣vernour</HI> they call him. The present Governour <HI>Mounsieur Duc de Longueville,</HI> to whom the charge of this province was committed by the present King <HI>Lewis</HI> the thirteenth <HI>Anno</HI> 1629. The Laws by which they are governed, are the <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Im∣perial,</HI> augmented by some customes of the <HI>French,</HI> and others more particular, which are the <HI>Nor∣man.</HI> One of the principallest is in matters of in∣heritance: the French custom giving to all the Sons an equality in their estate, which we in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
call <HI>Gavel-kind.</HI> The <HI>Norman</HI> dividing the estate into three parts, and thereof allotting two unto the eldest brother, and a third to be divided among the others. A Law which the <HI>French</HI> ac∣count not just, the younger brothers of <HI>England</HI> would think the contrary. To conclude this ge∣neral discourse of the <HI>Normans</HI>: I dare say it is as happy a Country as most in <HI>Europe,</HI> were it subject to the same Kings, and governed by the same Laws which it gave unto <HI>England.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>IƲne</HI> the 30th at six of the clock in the morning we landed at <HI>Diepe,</HI> one of the Haven Towns of <HI>Normandy,</HI> seated on an arm of the Sea, between two hils which imbrace it in the nature of a bag:
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
this secureth the Haven from the violence of the weather, and is a great strength to the Town a∣gainst the attempts of any forces, which should assault it by Sea, the Town lying within these Mountains a quarter of a mile up the channel. The Town it self is not uncomely, the streets large and well paved, the houses of an indifferent height, and built upright without any juttings out of one part over the other. The Fortifications (as they say, for we were not permitted to see them) are very good and modern, without, stones, within, earth. On the top of the hill a Castle finely seated, both to defend the Town, and on occasions to command it. The Garrison consisteth of sixty men, in pay no more, but when need requireth the Captain hath authority to arm the Inhabitants: The present Go∣vernour is the Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> who also is the Governour of the Province, intrusted with both those charges by <HI>Lewis</HI> the thirteenth, 1619. An action wherein he swarved somewhat from the ensample of his Father, who never committed the military command of a Country (which is the Office of a Governour) and the custody of a Town of war or a Fortress unto one man. The Duke of <HI>Biron</HI> might have as great a courtesie from that King, as the most deserving of his sub∣jects: he had stuck close to him in all his adversi∣ties, received many an honourable fear in his ser∣vice, and indeed was <HI>Fabius</HI> and <HI>Scipio,</HI> both the sword and buckler of the <HI>French Empire.</HI> In a word, he might have said to this <HI>Henry,</HI> what <HI>Silius</HI> in <HI>Tacitus</HI> did to <HI>Tiberius. Suum militem in obse∣quio mans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse, cum alii ad sedetiones prolaberentur, ne∣que
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
daraturum Tiberii imperium, si iis quoque Le∣gionibus cupido novandi fuisset</HI>; yet when he be∣came petitioner to the King for the Cittadel of <HI>Bourg,</HI> seated on the confines of his Government of <HI>Burgogne,</HI> the King denied it. The reason was, because Governours of Provinces which com∣manded in chief ought not to have the command of places and fortresses within their Government: there was also another reason, and more enfor∣cing, which was, that the petitioner was suspected to hold intelligence with the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> whose Town it was. The same <HI>Henry</HI> though he loved the Duke <HI>Espernon</HI> even to the envy of the Court, yet even to him also used he the same cauti∣on. Therefore when he had made him Govern∣our of <HI>Xanictoigne</HI> and <HI>Angoulmois,</HI> he put also in∣to his hands the Towns of <HI>Mets</HI> and <HI>Boullogne,</HI> places so remote from his seat of Government, and so distant one from the other, that they did rather distract his power than encrease it.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>England</HI> have been well, and for a long time, versed in this Maxime of State. Let <HI>Kent</HI> be one of our ensamples and <HI>Hampshire</HI> the other. In <HI>Kent</HI> at this time the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> (or as the <HI>French</HI> would call him) the <HI>Governour</HI> is the Earl of <HI>Montgomery</HI>; yet is <HI>Dover</HI> Castle in the hands of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and yet <HI>Quin∣borough</HI> in the custody of Sir <HI>Edward Hobby.</HI> Of which the one commandeth the Sea, and the other the <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Medway.</HI> In <HI>Hampshire</HI> the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> is the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> but the Go∣vernment of the Town and Garrison of <HI>Ports∣mouth</HI> is intrusted to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI> Nei∣ther
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
is there any of the best Sconces or Block-hou∣ses on the shore side of the Country which is com∣manded by the Lieutenant.</P>
<P>But King <HI>Lewis</HI> now raigning in <HI>France,</HI> minded not his Fathers actions, when at the same time also he made his Confident <HI>M. Luines</HI> Governour of <HI>Picardy,</HI> and of the Town and Cittadel of <HI>Amiens.</HI> The time ensuing gave him an insight of that state-breach; for when the Dukes of <HI>Espernon, Vendosme, Longueville, Magenne</HI> and <HI>Nemours,</HI> the Count of <HI>Soisons</HI> and others sided with the Queen Mother against the King; the Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> streng∣thened this <HI>Dieppe,</HI> and had not peace suddenly followed, would have made good, maugre the Kings forces. A town it is of great importance, King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth using it as his <HI>Asylum,</HI> or City of Refuge, when that League was hottest against him. For had he been further distressed, from hence might he have made an escape into <HI>England,</HI> and at this door was the entrance made for the Eng∣lish forces, which gave him the first step to his Throne. The Town hath been pillaged and taken by our <HI>Richard</HI> the first, in his warrs against <HI>Philip Augustus,</HI> and in the declining of our affairs in <HI>France,</HI> it was a moneth together besieged by the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> but with that success which com∣monly attendeth a falling Empire.</P>
<P>The number of the Inhabitants is about 30000. whereof 9000. and upwards are of the Religion, and have allowed them for the exercise of their Religion the Church of <HI>Argues,</HI> a Village some two miles distant. The Remainder are Papists. In this Town I met with the first Idolatry which ever
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
I yet saw, more than in my books. <HI>Quas antea au∣diebam hodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, video Deos,</HI> as a barbarous <HI>German</HI> in <HI>Velleius</HI> said to <HI>Tiberius.</HI> The Gods of <HI>Rome</HI> which before I onely heard of I now see, and might have worshipped, it was the <HI>Hoast,</HI> as they call it, or the Sacrament reserved, carried by a couple of Priests under a Canopy; ushered by two or three torches, and attended by a company of boyes &amp; old people which had no other imployment. Before it, went a bell continually tinckling, at the sound whereof all such as are in their houses, being warned that then their God goeth by them, make some shew of reverence; those which meet it in the street, with bended knees and elevated heads doing it honour. The Protestants of this bell make an use more reli∣gious, and use it as a warning or a watch-peal, to avoid that street through which they hear it coming. This invention of the Bell hath some∣what of <HI>Turcisme,</HI> it being the custom there, at their Canonical hours, when they hear the cryers bawl∣ing in the steeples; to fall prostrate on the ground wheresoever they are, and to kiss it thrice, so doing their devotions to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The carrying it about the streets hath no question in it a touch of the <HI>Jew:</HI> this Ceremony being borrowed from that of the carrying about the Ark upon the shoul∣ders of the Priests. The other main part of it, which is the adoration, is derived from the Hea∣then; there never being a people but they which afforded divine honour to things inanimate. But the people indeed I cannot blame for this idola∣trous devotion, their consciences being perswaded, that what they see pass by them is the very body of
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
their Saviour. For my part could the like beleif possess my understanding▪ I could meet it with a greater reverence, then their charge can enjoyn me. The Priests and Doctors of the people are to be condemned onely, who impose and inforce this sin upon their bearers, and doubtless there is a reward which attendeth them for it. Of standing it is so yoūg, that I never met with it before the year 1215. Then did Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> ordain in a Council holden at <HI>Rome,</HI> that there should be a Pixe made to cover the Bread, and a Bell bought to be rung before it. The adoration of it was enjoyned by Pope <HI>Honorius Anno Dom.</HI> 1226. Both afterwards encreast by the new solemn Feast of <HI>Corpus Chri∣sti</HI> day by Pope <HI>Ʋrban</HI> the fourth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1264. and confirmed for ever with multitudes of pardons in the Council of <HI>Vienna</HI> by <HI>Clement</HI> the third, <HI>Anno</HI> 1310. Such a punie is this great God of the Ro∣mans <HI>Lactantius</HI> in his first book of Institutions against the Gentiles taxeth the wise men of those times of infinite ridiculousness, who worshipped <HI>Jupiter</HI> as a God, <HI>Cum eundem tamen Saturno &amp; Rhea genitum confiterentur,</HI> since themselves so per∣fectly knew his original. As much I marvail at the impudency of the Romish Clergy, who will needs impose a new God upon their people, being so well acquainted with his cradle.</P>
<P>It is now time to go on in our journey to <HI>Roven.</HI> The Cart stayeth, and it is fit we were in it; Horses we could get none for money, and for love we did not expect them: we are now mount∣ed in our Chariot, for so we must call it. An English man thought it a plain Cart, and if it needs will
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
have the honour of being a Chariot, let it, sure I am it was never ordained for a triumph. At one end were fastened three carkasses of Horses, and three bodies which had been once Horses and now were worn to dead Images. Had the statue of a man been placed on any one of them, it might have been hang'd up at an Inn door to represent Saint <HI>George</HI> on horse-back: so liveless they were and so little moving; yet at last they began to crawl, for go they could not. This converted me from my former heresie, and made me apprehend life in them, but it was so little, that it seemed onely e∣nough to carry them to the next pack af Hounds. Thus accomodated we bad Farewell to <HI>Diepe,</HI> and proceeded with a pace so slow, that we thought our journey to <HI>Roven</HI> would prove a most perfect Emblem of the motion of the ninth Sphere, which was 49000. years in finishing. But this was not our greatest misery: The rain fell on us through our Tilt, which for the many holes in it we would have thought a net. The durt brake plentifully in upon us through the rails of our Chariot, &amp; the unequal and unproportionable pace of it startled almost every bone of us. I protest I marvel how a French-man durst adventure in it. Thus endured we all the dis∣eases of a journey, and the danger of three several deaths, drowning, choaking with the mire, and breaking of the wheel, besides a fear of being fa∣mished before we came to our Inn, which was six French miles from us. The mad Duke that in the Play undertook to drive two Snails from <HI>Millaine</HI> to <HI>Musco,</HI> without staffe, whip, or goad; and in a bravery to match him, for an experiment would
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
here have had matter to have tired his pati∣ence.</P>
<P>On the left hand we saw <HI>Argues,</HI> once famous for a siege laid about it by our <HI>Richard</HI> the first, but wasted speedily by the French. It is now (as be∣fore I told you) the Parish Church of <HI>Diepe Pro∣testants,</HI> their Preachers were Mr. <HI>Courteau</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mondeme,</HI> who had each of them an yearly sti∣pend, fifty pound or thereabouts. A poor pay, if the faithful discharge of that duty were not a re∣ward unto it self above the value of gold and si∣ver. To instance in none of these beggerly Vil∣lages we past through: we came at last unto <HI>Tostes,</HI> the place destinate to our Lodging, a Town like the worser sort of Market Towns in <HI>England.</HI> There our Charioter brought us to the ruines of an house, an Alehouse I would scarce have thought it, and yet in spite of my teeth it must be an Inn, yea, and that an honourable one too, as <HI>Don Quixot's</HI> Host told him. Despair of finding there either bedding or victuals, made me just like the fellow at the Gallows, who when he might have been reprei∣ved, on condition he would marry a Wench, which there sued for him, having veiwed well, cried to the Hangman to drive on his Cart. The truth is, <HI>I' eschappay du tonnere etrencheu en l'es lair,</HI> according to the French proverb; I fell out of the frying-pan into the hot fire. One of the house (a ragged fellow I am sure he was, and so most likely to live there) brought us to a room somewhat of kindred to a Charnel-house; as dark and as dampish: I confess it was paved with brick at the bottom, and had towards the Orchard a pretty hole, which in
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
former times had been a window, but now the glass was all vanished. By the light that came in at the hole, I first perceived that I was not in <HI>England.</HI> There stood in the chamber three beds, if at the least it be lawful so to call them. The foundation of them was of straw, so infinitely thronged toge∣ther, that the wooll-pack which our Judges fit on in the Parliament were melted butter to them; up∣on this lay a medley of flocks and feathers toge∣ther, sowed up in a large bag (for I am confident it was not a Tick) but so ill ordered, that the knobs stuck out on each side of it, like a crabtree-cudgel. He must needs have flesh enough that lieth upon one of them; otherwise the second night would wear out his bones. The sheets which they brought for us were so course, that in my consciente no Marriner would vouchsafe to use them for a sail: and the Coverlid so bare, that if a man would un∣dertake to reckon the threeds, he need not miss one of the number. The Napery of the Table was sutable to the bedding, so foul and durty, that I durst not conceive it had ever been washed above once, and yet the poor cloth looked as briskly, as if it had been promised for the whole year ensuing to scape many a scouring. The Napkins were fit companions for the cloath; <HI>Ʋnum si noveris, om∣nes nosti.</HI> By my description of the Inn, you may guess at the rest of <HI>France.</HI> Not altogether so wretched, yet is the alteration almost insensi∣ble.</P>
<P>Let us now walk into the Kitchen, and observe their provision, and here we found a most terrible execusion committed on the person of a Pullet.
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
My Hostess, cruel woman, had cut the throat of it, and without plucking off the feathers, tare it into pieces with her hands, and afterwards took away skin and feathers together, just as we strip Rabbets in <HI>England.</HI> This done, it was clapt into a pan, and fried into a supper. In other places where we could get meat for the spit, it useth to be presently broached, and laid perpendicularly over the fire: three turns at the most dispatcheth it, and bringeth it up to the table, rather scorched than roasted; I say, where we could get it, for in these rascally Inns you cannot have what you would, but what you may, and that also not at the cheapest. At <HI>Pontoise</HI> we met with a Rabbet, and we thought we had found a great purchase. Larded it was, as all meat is in that Country, otherwise it is so lean, it would never endure the roasting. In the eating it proved so tough, that I could not be perswaded that it was any more than three removes from that Rabbet which was in the Ark. The price half a Crown English: My Companions thought it over dear, to me it seem'd very reasonable, for certainly the grass that fed it was worth more than thrice the money: but I return to <HI>Tostes.</HI></P>
<P>And it is time, you might perchance else have lost the sight of mine Hostess and her Daughters, you would have sworn at first blush they had been of a bloud, and it had been great pitty, had it been otherwise. The salutation of <HI>Horace, O mater pul∣chra, filia pulchrior,</HI> was never so seasonable as here. Not to honour them with a further chara∣cter let this suffice that their persons kept so excel∣lent <HI>decorum</HI> with the house and furniture, that one
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
could not possibly make use of <HI>Tullies, Quam dis∣pari dominaris domino!</HI> But this is not their luck onely. The Women not of <HI>Normandy</HI> alone, but generally of all <HI>France</HI> are forced to be contented with a little beauty; and she which with us is rec∣koned among the vulgar; would amongst them be taken for a Princess. But of the French Women more, when we have taken a view of the Dames of <HI>Paris,</HI> now onely somewhat of their habit and con∣dition. Their habit in which they differ from the rest of <HI>France,</HI> is the attire of their heads, which hangeth down their backs in fashion of a vail. In <HI>Roven</HI> and the greater Cities, it is made of linnen pure and decent, here and in the villages it cannot possibly be any thing else than an old dish-clout turned out of service, or the corner of a table-cloth reserved from washing. Their best condition is not alwayes visible, they shew it onely in the morn∣ings, or when you are ready to depart, and that is their begging. You shall have about you such a throng of these ill faces, and every one whining out this ditty, <HI>Pour les servantes</HI>; that one might with greater ease distribute a dole at a rich mans funeral, then give them a penny: Had you a pur∣pose to give them unasked, their importunity will prevent your speediest bounty. After all this im∣portunate begging, their ambition reacheth no higher than a <HI>Sol</HI>: He that giveth more out-bid∣deth their expectation, and shall be counted a spend-thrift.</P>
<P>But the principal ornaments of these times are the men-servants, the raggedst regiment that ever I yet looked upon. Such a thing as a Chamberlain
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
was never heard of among them, and good clothes are as little known there as he. By the habit of his attendants a man would think himself in Gaole, their clothes either full of patches, or else open to the skin. Bid one of them wipe your boots, he presently hath recourse to the curtains; with those he will perhaps rub over one side, and leave the other to be made clean by the Guest. It is enough for him that he hath written the coppy. They wait alwayes with their hats on their heads, and so also do servants before their Masters: Attending-bare∣headed is as much out of fashion there as in <HI>Tur∣key.</HI> Of all <HI>French</HI> fashions in my opinion the most unfitting and unseeming. Time and much use re∣conciled me to all other things, which at the first were offensive, to this irreverent custom I returned an enemy. Neither can I see how it can choose but stomack the most patient, to see the worthiest sign of liberty usurped and profaned by the basest of slaves. For seeing that the French paisants are such infamous slaves unto their Lords and Princes; it cannot be, but that those which are their servants must be one degree at the least below the lowest condition.</P>
<P>Certainly among the Ancients this promiscuous covering of the head was never heard of, it was with them the chief sign of freedom, as is well known to those which are conversant with antiqui∣ty. The <HI>Lacones</HI> a people of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> after they had obtained to be made free Denizens of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> in sign of their now gotten liberty would never go into the battel, <HI>nisi pileati,</HI> but with their hats on. Amongst the <HI>Africans,</HI> as it is written
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
of <HI>Alexander, ab Alexandro,</HI> the placing of an hat on the top of a spear, was used as a token to incite the people to their liberty which had been oppres∣sed by <HI>Tyrants: Per pileum in bast â propositum ad libertatem proclamari.</HI> But among the <HI>Romans</HI> we have more variety. The taking off the hat of <HI>Targuinius Priscus</HI> by an Eagle, and the putting of it on again, occasioned the <HI>Augures</HI> to prophesie unto him the Kingdom; which fell out accord∣ingly. In their Sword-playes when one of their <HI>Gladiators</HI> had with credit slain his adversary, they would sometimes honour him with a <HI>Palm,</HI> some∣times with a Hat, of these the last was the worthier; the Palm onely honouring the Victor; this also enfranchising the receiver; therefore conferred commonly on him which killed most men in the Theaters: Hence the complaint of <HI>Tertuslian lib. de Spectaculis cap.</HI> 21. <HI>Qui insigniore cuiquam ho∣micide leonem poscit, idem gladiatori atroci Rudem petat (Redis</HI> was another token of enfranchize∣ment) <HI>&amp; pileum proemium conferat.</HI> In their common <HI>Forum</HI> or <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> when they purpo∣sed to manumit any of their servants, their custom also was, after the <HI>Lictor</HI> or <HI>Sergeant</HI> had registred the name of the party manumitted, to shave his head, and give him a cap, whence according to <HI>Rosinus, ad pileum Vocare,</HI> is to set one at li∣berty.</P>
<P><HI>Erasmus</HI> in his <HI>Chiliades</HI> maketh the hat to be the sign of some eminent worth iu him that wear∣eth it. <HI>Pileus</HI> (saith he) <HI>insigne spectatae, virtu∣tis.</HI> On this he conjectureth, that the putting on of caps on the heads of such as are created <HI>Doctors</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
or <HI>Masters</HI> had its original. In the Universities of <HI>England</HI> this custom is still in force, the putting on of the Cap being never performed but on the solemn <HI>Comitia,</HI> and in the presence of all such as are either auditors or spectators of that dayes ex∣ercise: When I was <HI>Regent,</HI> the whole house of <HI>Congregation</HI> joyned together in a petition to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> to restore unto us the <HI>jus pileo∣rum,</HI> the licence of putting on our caps at our pub∣like meetings, which priviledge time and the ty∣ranny of our <HI>Vice-Chancellors</HI> had taken from us. Amongst other motives we used the solemn form of creating a Mr. in the <HI>Arts</HI> by putting on his cap, and that that sign of liberty might distinguish us that were the <HI>Regents</HI> from those boyes which we were to govern: which request he graciously granted. But this <HI>French</HI> sauciness had drawn me out of my way. An impudent familiarity, which I must confess did much offend me, and to which I will still profess my self an open enemy. Though <HI>Jack</HI> speach <HI>French,</HI> I cannot endure that <HI>Jack</HI> should be a Gentleman.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>IƲly</HI> the first we set out for <HI>Roven</HI>; in ten hours our Cart dragged us thither, the whole journey being in all six miles <HI>French</HI>; admirable speed. About three of the clock in the afternoon we had a sight of the Town, daintily seated in a valley on the River <HI>Seine</HI>: I know not any Town better sci∣tuated (<HI>Oxford</HI> excepted) which indeed it much resembleth, I mean not in bigness but in scituation. It standeth on all sides environed with Mountains, the North excepted, and hath a large and pleasant walk of meadow by the river side, to the South-Eastward, as <HI>Oxford</HI> hath towards <HI>Iffley.</HI> It is seat∣ed on the principal River of <HI>France,</HI> distant from the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Countrey fifty miles Eng∣lish or thereabouts; as <HI>Oxford</HI> on the <HI>Thames</HI> and from <HI>London</HI>: watered also it is with two small Rillets, <HI>Rosee</HI> and <HI>Renelle,</HI> as the other with <HI>Char∣well</HI> and <HI>Evenlode.</HI> The difference is, that <HI>Oxford</HI> is seated somewhat higher on the swelling of an hill, and a little more removed from those moun∣tains which environ it, and that the Rivers which run through some part of <HI>Roven,</HI> do onely wash the precincts of the other. The buildings are in some places wood, in some stone, in others both. The houses without juttings or overlets four stories high, and in the front not very beautiful. The
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>
most promising house which mine eyes met with was that of Mr. <HI>Boniface,</HI> who being of obscure parents; and having raised himself a fortune in the wars against the <HI>League,</HI> here built a receptacle for his age. It is fashioned after the manner of new buildings in <HI>London,</HI> composed all of dainty white stone, square and polished. On the partition be∣twixt the first story and the second it hath these words engraven, <HI>Ʋt &amp; Virtute Martisopus; Ten∣tanda via amore &amp; armis.</HI> A Motto sutable to his rising.</P>
<P>The other buildings of note are the <HI>Bridge</HI> (for I as yet omit the House of Parliament and the Churches) and the Town wall by it. The Bridge whilst it was all standing, was thought to have been the fairest and strongest piece of that kind in all <HI>France,</HI> it consisted of twelve arches large and high, there now remain but seven of them, the rest being broken down by the English, in the falling of their affairs in <HI>France,</HI> the better to make good the Town against the French. The River is here about the breadth of the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Fullham.</HI> Be∣tween the River and the Town wall is the <HI>Ex∣change</HI> or meeting place of the Merchants, paved with broad and even pebble-stones; in breadth up to the wallwards thirty yeards, in length a hun∣dred. A fine walk in fair weather. All along the bankside lay the Ships, which by reason of the bro∣ken bridge come up hither, and on occasion high∣er; a good turn for <HI>Paris.</HI> The wall for the length of an hundred yeards is as streight as one may lay a line; of a just height, and composed of square and excellent stone so cunningly laid, that I never
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>
saw the side of a Noble mans house built more handsomly. But it is not onely the beauty of the wall which <HI>Roven</HI> delighteth in, there must some∣what also be expected of it for strength. To which purpose it might seem indifferently well, were there some addition of earth within it. It is well helped on the outside by the breadth and depth of the ditches, but more by St. <HI>Katharines</HI> Fort seated on an hill at the East side of it. A Fort which, were it strengthned according to the mo∣dern art of fortifying, would much assure the Town, and make it at once both a slave and a Commander. The <HI>Marshal</HI> D'c <HI>Anere,</HI> when he was Lieutenant here for the <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> began to fortifie this Mountain, <HI>Quilleboeuse</HI> and other places of importance; but upon his death they were all razed. What were his projects in it, they know best which were acquainted with his ambition. Certainly the jarrs which he had sown among the Princes, one with the other, and between them and the King, shew that they were not intended for no∣thing.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Roven</HI> thirty two Parish Churches, besides those which belong to <HI>Abbeys</HI> and <HI>Religi∣ous</HI> Houses; of which the most beautiful is that of St. <HI>Audom</HI> or <HI>Owen,</HI> once Arch-bishop of this City. The seat and Church of the Arch-bishop is that of <HI>Nostre-dame,</HI> a building far more gorgeous in the outside than within. It presents it self to you with a very gracious and majestical front, decked with most curious imagery, and adorned with three stately Towers. The first called <HI>La tour St. Ro∣main</HI>; the second <HI>La tour de beaurre</HI> (because it
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>
was built with that money which was raised by Cardinal <HI>D' Amboyse,</HI> for granting a dispensation to eat butter in the <HI>Lent</HI>) and a third built over the Porch, or great Door, wherein is the great Bell so much talked of: Within it is but plain and or∣dinary, such as common Cathedral Churches usually are, so big, so fashioned. Behind the high Altar at a pillar on the left hand is the remainder of the Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI>'s Tomb, which for ought I could discern was nothing but an Epitaph, some three yeards high in the Pillar. I saw nothing in it, which might move the envy of any Courtier to have it defaced, unless it were the title of <HI>Regent du Ro∣jaume de France,</HI> which is the least he merit∣ed.</P>
<P>Somewhat Eastward beyond this is our <HI>Ladies Chappel,</HI> a pretty neat piece, and daintily set out. There standeth on the top of the Screen the Image of the <HI>Virgin</HI> her self between two Angels. They have attired her in a red Mantle laced with two gold laces, a handsom ruffe about her neck, a vail of fine lawn hanging down her back, and (to shew that she was the Queen of Heaven) a Crown up∣on her head. In her left arm she holds her Son in his side coat, a black hat and a golden hat-band. A jolly plump Lady she seemeth to be, of a flaxen hair, a ruddy lip, and a chearful complexion. 'Twere well the Painters would agree about the limming of her; otherwise we are like to have as many Ladies as Churches. At <HI>Nostre dame</HI> in <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> she is taught us to be brown, and seemeth some∣what inclin'd to melancholy, I speak not of her different habit, for I envy her not her changes
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>
of apparel. Onely I could not but observe how those of St. <HI>Sepulchres Church en la rue St. Denis,</HI> hath placed her on the top of their Screen in a Coape, as if she had taken on her the zeal of <HI>A∣braham,</HI> and were going to make a bloudy sacrifice of her Son. They of <HI>Nostre-dame in Amiens</HI> have erected her Statue all in gold, with her Son also of the same mettal in her arms, casting beams of gold round about her, as the Sun is painted in its full glory. Strange Idolatries! On the contra∣ry, in the parish Church of <HI>Tury in la Beause</HI> she is to be seen in a plain petticoat of red, and her other garments correspondent. In my mind this hold∣eth most proportion to her estate, and will but serve to free their irreligion from an absurdity. If they will worship her as a Nurse with her Child in her arms, or at her breast, let them array her in such apparel as might beseem a Carpenters Wife, such as she might be supposed to have worn before the world had taken notice that she was the Mother of her Saviour. If they must needs have her in her estate of glory, as at <HI>Amiens</HI>; or of honour (be∣ing now publikely acknowledged to be the bles∣sedness among Women) as at <HI>Paris</HI>: let them disburden her of her Child. To clap them thus both together, is a folly equally worthy of scorn &amp; laughter. Certainly had she but so much liberty as to make choice of her own clothes, I doubt not but she would observe a greater <HI>decorum.</HI> And there∣fore I commend the Capouchins of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> who in a little side Chappel consecrated unto her, have placed onely an handsom fair looking-glass upon her Altar, the best ornament of a Female Closet.
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>
Why they placed it there I cannot say: onely I conceive it was, that she might there see how to dress her self.</P>
<P>This Church is said to have been built (I should rather think repaired) by <HI>Raoul</HI> or <HI>Rollo</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Normandy:</HI> Since it hath been much beautified by the English, when they were Lords of this Province. It is the seat of an Arch-bishop, a Dean and fifty Canons. The Arch-bishoprick was instituted by the authority of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, during the sitting of the Council of <HI>Arles; Anidian</HI> who was there present being consecrated the first Arch-bishop. The Bishops of Seas, <HI>Au∣renches, Constances, Beaux, Lysieaux</HI> and <HI>Eureux,</HI> were appointed for his Diocesans. The now Arch-bishop is said to be an able Schollar and a sound States-man: his name I enquired not. The Re∣venues of his Chair are said to be ten thousand Crowns. More they would amount to, were the Country any way fruitful of Vines: out of which the other Prelates of <HI>France</HI> draw no small part of their <HI>Intrado.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament of this Country was established here by <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth, who also built that fair Palace, wherein Justice is administred, <HI>Anno</HI> 1501. At that time he divided <HI>Normandy</HI> into seven <HI>Cathes, Rapes,</HI> or <HI>Baliwicks,</HI> viz. <HI>Roven, Caux, Con∣stentin, Caen, Eureux, Gisors,</HI> and <HI>Alenzon,</HI> This Court hath supreme power to enquire into, and give sentence of all causes within the limits of <HI>Normandy.</HI> It receiveth appeals from the inferi∣our Courts of the Dutchy unto it, but admitteth none from it. Here is also <HI>Cour des Esleuz,</HI> a Court

of the general Commissioners for taxes: and <HI>la Chambre des aides,</HI> instituted by <HI>Charles</HI> the seventh for the receiving of his subsidies, <HI>Gabels, Imposts,</HI> &amp;c. The house of Parliament is in form <HI>quadran∣gular,</HI> a very graceful and delectable building. That of <HI>Paris</HI> is but a <HI>Chaos</HI> or a <HI>Babel</HI> to it. In the great Hall (into which you ascend by some thirty steps or upwards) are the seats and desks of the <HI>Procu∣rators,</HI> every ones name being written in Capital letters over his head. These Procurators are like our Attourneys, to prepare causes, and make them ready for the <HI>Advocates.</HI> In this Hall do suitors use, either to attend, or walk up and down and con∣fer with their pleaders. Within this Hall is the great Chamber, the Tribunal or Seat of Justice, both in Causes Criminal and Civil.</P>

The seiling all inlaid with gold, and yet did the workmanship exceed the mat∣ter.

<P>We said even now, that from the sentence of this Court there lay no appeal: but this must be re∣canted, and it is no shame to do it. St. <HI>Austin</HI> hath writ his <HI>Retractions</HI>; so also hath <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> Once in the year there is an appeal admitted; but for one man onely, and that on this occasion. There was a poysonous Dragon not far from <HI>Roven,</HI> which had done much harm to the Country and City. Many wayes had been tried to destroy him, but none prospered. At last <HI>Roman,</HI> afterwards made a St. then Arch-bishop of the Town, ac∣companied with a theif and a murderer, whose lives had been forfeited to a sentence, undertaketh the enter prise. Upon sight of the Dragon the theif stole away, the murderer goeth in and seeth that holy man vanquish the Serpent, armed onely with a <HI>Stoale</HI> (it is a neck habit sanctified by his holiness of <HI>Rome,</HI> and made much after the fashion of a tippet) with this <HI>Stoale</HI> tyed about the neck of the Dragon doth the murderer lead him priso∣ner to <HI>Roven.</HI> To make short work; the Name of God is praised, the Bishop magnified, the murderer pardoned, and the Dragon burned. This accident (if the story be not <HI>Apocrypha</HI>) is said to have hap∣ned on <HI>Holy Thursday. Audom</HI> or <HI>Owen</HI> successor unto St. <HI>Roman,</HI> in memory of this marvellous act, obtained of King <HI>Dagobert</HI> the first (he began his raign <HI>Anno</HI> 632.) that from that time forwards the Chapter of the Cathedral Church should on every <HI>Ascension</HI> day have the faculty of delivering any Malefactor whom the Laws had condemned.
<PB N="33" REF="19"/>
This that King then granted, and all the following Kings to this time have successively confirmed it. I omit the ceremonies and solemnities wherewith this Prisoner is taken out of his Irons and restored to liberty. It is not above nine years agone, since a Baron of <HI>Gascoyne</HI> took occasion to kill his Wife; which done, he fled hither into <HI>Normandy</HI>; and having first acquainted the Canons of <HI>Nostre∣dame</HI> with his desire, put himself to the sentence of the Court, and was adjudged to the <HI>Wheele. As∣cension</HI> day immediately comming on, the Canons challenged him, and the Judge, according to the custom, caused him to be delivered. But the <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> pleaded, that the benefit of that priviledge belonged onely to the Natives of that Country, and they pleaded with such fury, that the Baron was a∣gain committed to prison, till the <HI>Queen Mother</HI> had wooed the people, <HI>pro eâ saltem vice,</HI> to admit of his repreival.</P>
<P>I deferred to speak of the language of <HI>Norman∣dy,</HI> till I came hither, because here it is best spoken. It differeth from the <HI>Parisian,</HI> and more elegant French, almost as much as the English spoken in the <HI>North</HI> doth from that of <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Oxford.</HI> Some of the old <HI>Norman</HI> words it still retaineth, but not many. It is much altered from what it was in the time of the Conqueror: few of the words in which our Laws were written being known by them. One of our company gave a <HI>Lit∣tletons tenures</HI> written in that language to a <HI>French Doctor</HI> in the Laws, who protested that in three lines he could not understand three words of it.

<P><HI>IƲly</HI> the second we took our farewell of <HI>Roven</HI>; better accommodated than when we came thi∣ther; yet not so well as I desired. We are now preferred, <HI>ab asinis ad equos,</HI> from the Cart to the Waggon. The <HI>French</HI> call it a <HI>Coach,</HI> but that mat∣ters not; so would they needs have the Cart to be Chariot▪ These Waggons are ordinary instru∣ments of travel in those Countries, much of kin to a <HI>Graves-end Barge:</HI> you shall hardly find them without a knave or a <HI>Giglot.</HI> A man may be sure to be merry in them, were he as certain of being wholesome. This in which we travelled contain∣ed ten persons, as all of them commonly do: and amongst these ten, one might have found <HI>English, Scots, French, Normans, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI>; a jolly medley; had our religions been as different as our Nations, I should have thought my self in
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> or <HI>Poland.</HI> If a man had desired to have seen a brief or an <HI>Epitome</HI> of the world, he could no where have received such satisfaction, as by looking on us. I have already reckoned up the several nations, I will now lay open the several con∣ditions. There were then to be found among these passengers Men and Women, Lords and Serving-men, Schollars and Clowns, Ladies and Chamber∣maids, Priests and Lay-men, Gentlemen and Arti∣ficers, people of all sexes, and almost of all ages▪ If all the learning in the world were lost, it might be found in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> so said <HI>Budaeus.</HI> If all the Nations in the world had been lost, they might have been found again in our Waggon, so I: Seriously I think our Coach to have been no unfit represen∣tation of the Ark, a whole world of men and lan∣guages might have grown out of it.</P>
<P>But all this while our Waggon joggeth on, but so leasuresy, that it gave me leave to take a more patient view of the Country then we could in the Cart. And here indeed I saw sufficient to affect the Country, yea to dote on it; had I not come out of <HI>England.</HI> The fields such as already I have described: every where beset with Apple-trees, and fruits of the like nature: you could scarce see any thing which was barren in the whole Coun∣try. These Apples are both meat and drink to the poor Pesant, for the Country is ill provided with vines (the onely want I could observe in it) and Beer is a good beverage at a Gentlemans table. Sider then or Perry are the poor mans Clarret; and happy man is he, which can once or twice in a week aspire so high above water. To proceed▪
<PB N="36" REF="21"/>
Through many a miserable Village (<HI>Duburgs</HI> they call them) and one Town somewhat bigger then the rest, called <HI>Ecquille,</HI> we came that night to St. <HI>Claire,</HI> ten French miles from <HI>Roven.</HI> A poor Town, God wot, and had nothing in it remarkable, but an accident. There dwelt a Monk grown into great opinion for his sanctity; and one who had an especial hand on sore eyes: yet his ability here∣in was not general, none being capable of cure from him, but pure Virgins. I perswade my self <HI>France</HI> could not yeild him many Patients: and yet from all parts he was much sought unto. Hope of cure, and a charitable opinion which they had of themselves, had brought unto him divers di∣stressed Damsels, which I am confident had no in∣terest in his miracle. In the same Inn (Alehouse I should say) where we were to be harboured, there had put in a whole covey of these Ladies Er∣rant. Pilgrims they called themselves, and had come on foot two dayes journey to clear their eye-sight. They had white vails hanging down their backs, which in part covered their faces, yet I perceived by a glimpse, that some of them were past cure: though my charity durst allow them Maids▪ it was afraid to suppose them Virgins: yet so far I dare assure them they should recover their sight, that when they came home they should see their folly. At that time, what with too much watching on ship-board, what with the tartness of the water, and the violence of the wind working upon me almost forty hours together whilst I lay on the hatches mine eyes had gotten a rheum and redness. My Hostess (good woman) perswaded
<PB N="37" REF="21"/>
me to this holy and blessed Wight; but I durst not venture; not that I had not as good a claim to my virginity as the best there; but because I had learn∣ed what a greivous sentence was denounced on <HI>Ahaziah</HI> King of <HI>Israel</HI> for seeking help of <HI>Beel∣zebub</HI> the God of <HI>Ekron</HI>: When I hap to be ill, let mine amendment come in God's Name. <HI>Mal∣lem semper profanus esse, quám sic religiosus,</HI> as <HI>Mi∣nutius Felix</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sacrifices: let my body still be troubled with a sore eye, then have such a recovery be a perpetual eye-sore to my conscience. Rather than go on pilgrimage to such a Saint, let the <HI>Papists</HI> count me for an Heretick. Besides, how durst I imagine in him an ability of curing my bo∣dily eyes, who above seventy years had been trou∣bled with a blindness in the eyes of his soul. <HI>Thou Fool</HI> (said our Saviour almost in the like case) <HI>first cast out the beam of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brothers eye.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning, <HI>August</HI> the third, I left my Pilgrims to try their fortunes, and went on in our journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> which that day we were to visit. My eyes not permitting me to read, and mine ears altogether strangers to the French chat, drave my thoughts back to <HI>Roven</HI>; and there nothing so much possessed me, as the small honour done to <HI>Bedford</HI> in his Monument. I had leisure enough to provide him a longer Epitaph; and a short apo∣logy against the envy of that Courtier which per∣swaded <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth to deface the ruines of his Sepulcher, Thus:

<L>Thy Fathers felt it. Oh thou worst of men</L>
<L>(If Man thou art) do not endeavour then</L>
<L>This Conqueror from his last Hold to thrust;</L>
<L>Whom all brave minds shall honour in the dust.</L>
<L>But be not troubled <HI>Bedford!</HI> Thou shalt stand</L>

<L>A Pyramis unto it self shall raise.</L>
<L>Thy brave Atchievements in the time to come</L>

<L>Thy name shall be thy Epitaph: and he</L>
<L>Which once reads <HI>Bedford</HI> shall imagine thee</L>
<L>Beyond the power of Verses; and shall say,</L>

<L>Whilst <HI>France</HI> remains, and Histories are writ,</L>

<P>Having offered this unworthy, yet grateful sa∣crifice to the Manes of that brave <HI>Heroe,</HI> I had the more leisure to behold <HI>Mante,</HI> and the Vines a∣bout it, being the first that ever I saw. They are planted like our Hop-gardens, and grow up by the help of Poles, but not so high. They are kept with little cost: and yeild profit to an Husband∣man sufficient to make him rich, had he neither King nor Landlord. The Wine which is pressed out of them is harsh and not pleasing; as much dif∣fering in sweetness from the Wines of <HI>Paris</HI> or <HI>Orleans,</HI> as their language doth in elegancy. The rest of the Norman Wines which are not very fre∣quent, as growing onely on the frontiers towards <HI>France,</HI> are of the same quality. As for the Town of <HI>Mante</HI> it seemeth to have been of good strength before the use of great Ordinance; having a wall, a competent ditch, and at every gate a Draw∣bridge. They are still sufficient to guard their pullen from the Fox; and in the night time to se∣cure their houses from forrain burglaries: Once indeed they were able to make resistance to a King of <HI>France,</HI> but the <HI>English</HI> were then within it: At last on honourable terms it yeilded, and was entred by <HI>Charles</HI> the seventh the second of <HI>August, Anno</HI> 1449. The Town is for building and bigness some∣what above the better sort of Market Towns here in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="23"/>The last Town of <HI>Normandy</HI> towards <HI>Paris</HI> is <HI>Pontoise</HI>: a Town well fortified, as being a borde∣rer, and one of the strongest bulwarks against <HI>France.</HI> It hath in it two fair Abbeys of <HI>Mau∣buisson</HI> and St. <HI>Martin</HI>: six Churches parochial, whereof that of <HI>Nostre-dame</HI> in the suburbs is most beautiful. The name it derives from a bridge built over the River of <HI>Oyse,</HI> on which it is scitua∣ted, and by which on that side it is well defended: the bridge being strengthened with a strong gate, and two draw-bridges. It is commodiously scitu∣ate on the rising of an hill; and is famous for the siege laid before it by <HI>Charles</HI> the seventh, <HI>Anno</HI> 1442. but more fortunate unto him in the taking of it. For having raised his armes upon the Duke of <HI>Yorkes</HI> coming to give him battel with 6000. men onely, the French Army consisting of double the number, he retired, or fled rather, unto St. <HI>De∣uis.</HI> But there hearing how scandalous his retreat was to the <HI>Parisians,</HI> even ready to mutiny; and that the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and others of the Prin∣ces, stirred with the ignominiousness of his flight, began to practise against him; he speedily return∣eth to <HI>pontoise</HI> and maketh himself Master of it by assault. Certainly to that fright he owed the get∣ting of the Town, and all <HI>Normandy</HI>; the <HI>French</HI> by that door making their entry into this Province; out of which at last they thrust the <HI>English, Anno</HI> 1450. So desperate a thing is a frighted Cow∣ard.</P>
<P>This Country had once before been in possessi∣on of the <HI>English</HI>: and that by a firmer title than the Sword. <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conqueror</HI> had conveyed
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>
it once over the Seas into <HI>England,</HI> &amp; it continued an appendix of that Crown from the year 1067. unto that of 1204. At that time <HI>John</HI> called <HI>Sáns</HI>
<HI>terre,</HI> third Son unto King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, ha∣ving usurped the States of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> possessions in <HI>France</HI> upon <HI>Arthur</HI> heir of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> and Son unto <HI>Geofrey</HI> his elder brother; was warred on by <HI>Phillip Augustus</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who sided with the said <HI>Arthur,</HI> In the end <HI>Ar∣thur</HI> was taken, and not long after found dead in the ditches of the Castle of <HI>Roven.</HI> Whether this violent death happened unto him by the practises of his Uncle, as the <HI>French</HI> say, or that the young Prince came to that unfortunate end in an attempt to escape, as the <HI>English</HI> report, is not yet deter∣mined. For my part considering the other carria∣ges and virulencies of that King; I dare be of that opinion, that the death of <HI>Arthur</HI> was not with∣out his contrivement. Certainly he that rebelled against his Father, and practised the eternal im∣prisonment and ruine of his Brother, would not much stick (this being so speedy a way to settle his affairs) at the murther of a Nephew. Upon the first bruit of this murther, <HI>Constance</HI> Mother to the young Prince, complained unto the King and Par∣liament of <HI>France</HI>; not the Court which now is in force, consisting of men only of the long Robe: but the Court of <HI>Pairrie,</HI> or twelve Peers, whereof himself was one as Duke of <HI>Normandy.</HI> I see not how in justice <HI>Philip</HI> could do less than summon him: an Homager being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain, and an Homager accused. To this summons <HI>John</HI> refused to yeild himself. A counsel rather magnanimous than wise,
<PB N="42" REF="24"/>
and such as had more in it of an English King than a French Subject. <HI>Edward</HI> the third a prince of a finer mettal than this <HI>John</HI> obeyed the like warrant and performed a personal homage to <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Valoys</HI>: and it is not reckoned among his dispa∣ragements. He committed yet a further error or solaecisme in State, not so much as sending any of his people to supply his place, or plead his cause. Upon this none appearance the Peers proceed to sentence. <HI>Il fur par Arrest la dire Cour</HI> (saith Du' <HI>Chesne) condemne pour attaint, et convainuc du crime de parricide, &amp; de felonnie</HI>: Parricide for the killing of his own Nephew, and felony for committing an act so execrable on the person of a French vassal and in <HI>France. Jhon de Sienes</HI> addeth a third cause, which was contempt in disobeying the Kings commandement. Upon this verdict the Court awarded; <HI>Que toutes les terres qu' il avoit par deca de mourerient acquises &amp; confisques a la corronne, &amp;c.</HI> A proceeding so fair and orderly, that I should sooner accuse King <HI>John</HI> of indiscre∣tion, than the <HI>French</HI> of injustice: when my estate or life is in danger, I wish it may have no more si∣nister a trial. The <HI>English</HI> thus outed of <HI>Normandy</HI> by the weakness of <HI>John,</HI> recovered it again by the puissance of <HI>Henry.</HI> But being held onely by the sword; it was after thirty years recovered again as I have told you. And now being passed over the <HI>Oyse,</HI> I have at once freed the <HI>English</HI> and my self of <HI>Normandy,</HI> here ending this Book, but not that dayes journey.</P>

For when <HI>Me∣roveus</HI> the Grandchild of <HI>Pharamond,</HI> first King of the <HI>Francones,</HI> had taken an opportunity to pass the <HI>Rhene,</HI> having also during the warres between the <HI>Romans</HI> and the <HI>Gothes</HI> taken <HI>Paris</HI>; he resol∣ved

there to set up his rest: and to make that the head City of his <HI>Empire.</HI> The Country round a∣bout it, which was of no large extent, he com∣manded to be called <HI>Francia,</HI> or <HI>Terra Franco∣rum,</HI> after the name of his <HI>Francks</HI> whom he go∣verned. In this bounded and restrained sense, we now take it, being confined with <HI>Normandy</HI> on the North, <HI>Campagne</HI> on the East, and on the West and South with the little Province of <HI>la Be∣ausse.</HI> It is also called, and that more properly, to distinguish it from the whole continent, the <HI>Isle of France,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>the Isle</HI>; I know not any thing more like it, then the <HI>Isle of Elie</HI>: the <HI>Eure</HI> on the West, the <HI>Velle</HI> on the East, the <HI>Oyse</HI> on the Northward, and a vein riveret of the <HI>Seine</HI> towards the South, are the Rivers which encircle it. But the principall environings are made by the <HI>Seine,</HI> and the <HI>Marne,</HI> a river of <HI>Champagne,</HI> which within the main <HI>Island,</HI> make divers <HI>Ilets:</HI> the waters winding up and down, as desirous to recreate the earth, with the pleasures of its love∣ly and delicious embraces.</P>
<P>This <HI>Isle,</HI> this portion of <HI>Gaule</HI> properly and limitedly stiled <HI>France,</HI> was the seate of the <HI>Franks,</HI> at their first coming hither; and hath still conti∣nued so. The rest of <HI>Gallia</HI> is in effect rather sub∣dued by the <HI>French</HI> than inhabited; their valour in time having taken in those Countries which they never planted. So that if we look appre∣hensively into <HI>Gaule,</HI> we shall find the other <HI>Na∣tions</HI> of it, to have just cause to take up the com∣plaint of the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> against <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Castile,</HI> for assuming to himself the title of <HI>Ca∣tholique
<PB N="45" REF="25"/>
King of Spain, eius tam non exiguâ parte penes reges alios,</HI> as <HI>Mariana</HI> relateth it. Cer∣tain it is, that the least part of <HI>old Gallia,</HI> is in the hands of the <HI>French</HI>; the <HI>Normans, Britons, Biscaines,</HI> or <HI>Gascoynes,</HI> the <HI>Gothes</HI> (of <HI>Langue∣doc</HI> and <HI>Provence) Burgundians,</HI> and the ancient <HI>Gaules</HI> of <HI>Poictou,</HI> retaining in it such fair and ample Provinces. But it is the custome (shall I say) or fate of lesser and weaker Nations, to loose their names unto the stronger; as Wives do to their Husbands: and the smaller Rivers to the greater. Thus we see the little Province of <HI>Po∣land</HI> to have mastered, and given name to the <HI>Pruteni, Marovy,</HI> and other Nations of <HI>Sarmatia, Europaea</HI>: as that of <HI>Moseo</HI> hath unto all the <HI>Pro∣vinces</HI> of <HI>Asiatica.</HI> Thus hath <HI>Sweden</HI> conquered and denominated almost all the great <HI>Peninsula</HI> of <HI>Scandia,</HI> where it is but a little parcell: and thus did the <HI>English Saxon,</HI> being the most pre∣vailing of the rest, impose the name of <HI>English</HI> on all the people of the <HI>Heptarchy.</HI></P>
<Q>Et dedit imposito nomina prisca jugo.</Q>
<P>And good reason the vanquished should sub∣mit themselves as well unto the appellation, as the Lawes of the Victor.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> then are possessors of some part of <HI>old Gallia,</HI> and masters of the rest; possessors not of their Cities onely, but their conditions; a double victory it seemeth they enjoyed over that people: and took from them at once, both their Qualities and their Countries. Certainly whoso∣ever will please to peruse the Commentaries of <HI>Caesar de Bello Gallice,</HI> he will easily guess him an

He will rather make himself beleeve that he hath Prophicied the cha∣racter of the present <HI>French,</HI> then delivered one of the ancient <HI>Gaules.</HI> And indeed it is a matter worthy both of wonder and observation, that the old <HI>Gaules,</HI> being in a manner all worn out, should yet have most of their condition surviving in those men which now inhabit that Region, be∣ing of so many several Countries and originals. If we dive into Natural causes, we have a speedy recourse unto the powerfull influence of the Hea∣vens; for as those celestial bodies considered in the general, do work upon all sublunary bodies in the general, by light, influence, and motion: so have they a particular operation on particulars: an operation there is wrought by them in a man, as born at such and such a minute; and again, as born under such and such a climate: the one de∣rived from the setting of the houses, and the Lord of the <HI>Horoscope</HI> at the time of his nativity: the other from that Constellation which govern∣eth as it were the Province of his birth; and is the <HI>Genius</HI> or <HI>Deus tutelaris loci.

To go yet higher and further, the Philosopher <HI>Anacharsis</HI> (and he lived six hundred and odd years before <HI>Christ</HI>) noted it in the <HI>Greeks,</HI> that at the beginning of their feasts they used little goblets, and greater towards the end, when

Sr. <HI>George San∣dis</HI> in that excellent discourse of his own travells, reporteth the same custome to continue still a∣mongst them, notwithstanding the length of time, and all those changes of State and People which have since happened. Their Empire indeed they have lost, their Valour, and all other Graces which set them out in the eye of the World; and no marvail, these were not National condi∣tions, but personall endowments. I conclude this digression with the words of <HI>Barklay, Hae∣ret itaque in omnì gente vis quaedam inconcussa, quae hominibus pro conditione terrarum in quibus nasc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contigerit, sua fata dimiserit.</HI></P>
<P>The present <HI>French,</HI> then is nothing but an old <HI>Gaule,</HI> moulded into a new name: as rash he is, as head strong, and as hair-brain'd. A Nation whom you shall winne with a feather, and loose with a straw; upon the first sight of him, you shall have him as familiar as your sleep, or the ne∣cessity of breathing, In one hours conference, you may indear him to you, in the second un∣button him, the third pumps him dry of all his secrets, and he gives them you as faithfully, as if you were his <HI>Ghostly Father,</HI> and bound to con∣ceale them <HI>sub sigillo confessionis</HI>; when you have learned this, you may lay him aside, for he is no lon∣ger serviceable. If you have any humor in holding him in a further acquaintance (a favour which he confesseth, and I beleeve him, he is unworthy of,) himself will make the first separation: he hath

said over his lesson now unto you, and now must find out some body else, to whom to repeate it. <HI>Fare</HI> him well; he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a garment whom I would be loath to wear above two dayes together, for in that time he will be thred bare. <HI>Familiare est ho∣minis omnia sibi remittere,</HI> saith <HI>Velleius</HI> of all▪ it holdeth most properly in this people. He is very kind hearted to himself, and thinketh himself as free from wants, as he is full: so much he hath in him the nature of a <HI>Chynois</HI>; that he thinketh all men blind but himself. In this private self con∣ceitedness he hateth the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> loveth not the <HI>English,</HI> and contemneth the <HI>German</HI>: himself is the onely Courtier and compleat Gentleman; but it is his own glass which he seeth in. Out of this conceit of his own excellencie, and partly out of a shallowness of brain, he is very lyable to exceptions; the least distaste that can be, draw∣eth his sword, and a minutes pause sheatheth it to your hand: afterwards if you beat him into better manners, he shall take it kindly, and cry <HI>Serviteur.</HI> In this one thing they are wonderfully like the Devil; meekness or submission makes them insolent, a little resistance putteth them to their heeles, or makes them your <HI>Spaniels.</HI> In a word (for I have held him too long) he is a wal∣ing vanitie in a new fashion.</P>
<P>I will give you now a taste of his Table, which you shall find in a measure furnished, (I speak not of the Paisant) but not with so full a manner as with us. Their Beef they cut out into such chops, that that which goeth there for a laudable dish, would be thought here a <HI>Ʋniversity Com∣mons</HI>;

new served from the Hatch. A Loyne of Mutton serves amongst them for three rostings, besides the hazard of making pottage with the rump. Fowl also they have in good plenty; es∣pecially such as the King found in <HI>Scotland:</HI> to say truth, that which they have, is sufficient for nature and a friend, were it not for the Mistriss, or the Kitchin wench. I have heard much fame of the <HI>french</HI> Cookes, but their skill lyeth not in the neat handling of Beef or Mutton. They (have as generally have all this Nation) good fancies, and are speciall fellowes for the making of puff pastes, and the ordering of banquets. Their trade is not to feed the belly, but the pallat. It is now time you were set down, where the first thing you must do, is to say your own Grace; private Graces are as ordinary there, as private Masses, and from thence I think they learned them. That done, fall to where you like best; they observe no method in their eating, and if you look for a carver, you may rise fasting. When you are risen, if you can digest the sluttishness of the Cookery, (which is most abominable at first sight) I dare trust you in a Garrison; follow him to Church and there he will shew himself most irrereligious and irreverent: I speak not of all but the gene∣ral. At a Masse in <HI>Cordeliers</HI> Church in <HI>Paris,</HI> I saw two <HI>French</HI> Papists, even when the most sacred Mistery of their faith was celebrating, break out in∣to such a blasphemous and athiestical laughter, that even an <HI>Ethnick</HI> would have hated it: it was well they were known to be <HI>Catholiques,</HI> otherwise some <HI>French</HI> hot head or other, would have sent them laughing to <HI>Pluto.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="28"/>The <HI>French</HI> Language is indeed very sweet and delectable, it is cleared of all harshness, by the cutting and leaving out the consonants, which makerh it fall off the tongue very volubly; yet in mine opinion, it is rather elegant than copious; and therefore is much troubled for want of words to find out Periphrases. It expresseth very much of it self in the action: the head, body and shoul∣ders concurre all in the pronouncing of it; and he that hopeth to speak it with a good grace, must have something in him of the <HI>Mimick.</HI> It is en∣riched with a full number of significant Proverbs, which is a great help to the <HI>French</HI> humor in scof∣fing, and very full of Courtship, which maketh all the people complemental; the poorest Cob∣ler in the village hath his Court cringes, and his <HI>eau bemste de Cour,</HI> his Court holy water as per∣fectly as the Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Passadoes</HI> of their Courtship, they ex∣presse themselves with much variety of gesture, and indeed it doth not misbecome them: were it as gracious in the Gentlemen of other Nations as in them, it were worth your patience; but the affectation of it is scurvy and ridiculous. <HI>Quocun∣que salutationis artificio corpus inflestant, putes ni∣hil ist â institutione mages convenice.

procured him an enterveiwe; when he came with∣in the presence Chamber, he began to compose his head, and carryed it, as though he had been ridden with a Martingale; next he fell to draw back his leggs, and thrust out his shoulders, and that with such a graceless apishness, that the King asked him, if he meant to shoulder him out of his Chair, and so left him to act out his complement to the hangings. In their Courtship they bestow e∣ven the highest titles upon those of the lowest con∣dition. This is the vice also of their common talk, the begger begitteth <HI>Monsieurs</HI> and <HI>Ma∣dames</HI> to his Sonnes and Daughters, as familiarly as the King: were there no other reason to per∣swade me, that the <HI>Welch</HI> or <HI>Brittaynes</HI> were the defendants of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> this onely were suffici∣ent, that they would all be Gentlemen.</P>
<P>His discourse runneth commonly on two wheeles, <HI>Treason</HI> and <HI>Ribaldry</HI>; I never heard people talk less reverently of their Prince, nor more sawcily of his actions; scarce a day passeth away, without some seditious pamphlet printed and published in the disgrace of the King, or of some of his Courtires. These are every mans mo∣ney, and he that buyeth them is not coye of the Contents, be they never so scandalous: of all hu∣mors the most harsh and odious. Take him from this (which you can hardly do till he hath told all) and then he falleth upon his ribaldry; with∣out these crutches, his discourse would never be able to keep pace with his company. Thus shall you have them relate the stories of their own un∣cleanness, with a face as confident, as if they

Thus will they reckon up the several profanations of pleasure, by which they have <HI>dismanned themselves</HI>; sometimes not sparing to descend unto particulars.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Am now come to the <HI>French</HI> Women; and it were great pitty they should not immediately follow the discourse of the Men; so like they are one to the other, that one would think them to be the same, and that all the difference lay in the apparel: for person they are generally of an in∣different stature, their bodies straight, and their wastes commonly small; but whether it be so by, nature, or by much restraining of those parts, I cannot say. It is said that an <HI>absolute Woman</HI> should have (amongst other qualities requisite) the parts of a <HI>French</HI> Woman from the neck to the girdle; but I beleeve it holdeth not good; their shoulders and backs being so broad, that they hold no proportion with their middles: yet this may be the vice of their apparrel. <HI>Their hands</HI> are in my opinion the comelyest and <HI>best or∣dered</HI> parts of them, <HI>long, white, and slender</HI>; were their faces answerable, even an <HI>English</HI> eye would apprehend them lovely: but here I find a pretty contradictory, the hand, as it is the best orna∣ment of the whole structure, so doth it most dis∣grace it: whether it be that ill dyet be the cause
<PB N="55" REF="30"/>
of it, or that hot blood wrought upon by a hot and scalding ayr, must of necessity by such means vent itself, I am not certain: this I am sure of that scarce the tythe of all the maids we saw, had their hands, armes, and wrests free from scabs; which had overrunne them like a Leprosie. Their hair is generally black, and indeed somewhat blac∣ker, then a gratious loveliness would admit. The Poets commend <HI>Leda</HI> for her black hair, and not unworthily.</P>
<Q>Leda fuit nigris conspicienda comis.</Q>
<P>As <HI>Ovid</HI> hath it; yet was that blackness but a darker brown, and not so fearful as this of the <HI>French</HI> women. Again the blackness of <HI>the hair is there accounted an ornament</HI>; when the face a∣bout which it hangeth, is of so perfect a comple∣ction and symmetrie, that it giveth a lustre; then doth <HI>the hair set forth the face, as a shaddow doth a picture,</HI> and the face becometh the hair, as <HI>a field argent doth a sable bearing</HI>: which kind of armou∣ry the Heralds call the most fairest, But in this the <HI>French</HI> Women are most unlucky, <HI>Don Quix∣ote</HI> did not so deservedly assume to himself the name of <HI>the Knight of the ill favoured face</HI>; as may they that of the Damosells of it. It was therefore a happy speech of a young <HI>French</HI> gallant, that came in our company out of <HI>England,</HI> and had it been spoken amongst the Ancients, it might have been registred for an <HI>Apothegme</HI>: That the <HI>English</HI> of all the people in the World were only <HI>Nati ad voluptates</HI>: you have, saith he, <HI>the fair∣est
<PB N="56" REF="31"/>
Women, the goodliest Horses,</HI> and <HI>the best breed of Doggs under Heaven</HI>: for my part (as farre as I could in so short a time observe) I dare in his first beleeve him. <HI>Enland</HI> not onely being (as it is stiled) <HI>a Paradise for Women,</HI> by reason of their priviledges; but a <HI>Paradise also of Wo∣men,</HI> by reason of their unmatchable perfections: Their dispositions hold good intelligence with their faces; you cannot say of them as <HI>Sueton</HI> doth of <HI>Galba, Ingenium Galbae male habitat</HI>: they suit so well the one with the other, that in my life I never met with a better decorum. But you must first here them speak, <HI>Loquere ut te videam,</HI> was the method in old times, and it holdeth now. You cannot gather a better Character of a <HI>French</HI> Woman than from her <HI>prating, which is tedious and infinite; that you shall sooner want ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, than she tongue.</HI> The fastedious pratler which <HI>Horace</HI> mentioneth in his ninth Satyre, was but a Puesne to her. The writers of these times call the <HI>Sici∣lians gerrae Siculae,</HI> and not undeservedly; yet were they but the Scholers of the <HI>French</HI>; and learned this faculty of them before the Vespers. It is manners to give precedency to the Maistres∣se, and she will have it, if words may carry it for two things, I would have had <HI>Aristotle</HI> acquaint∣ed with these Chartings; first it would have sa∣ved him a labour in taking such paines about find∣ing out the prepetual motion: secondly it would have freed him from an Heresie with which his doctrine is now inserted, and that is, <HI>Quicquid movetur, ab alio movetur</HI>; their tongues I am certain move themselves, and make their own
<PB N="57" REF="31"/>
occasions of discoursing: when <HI>they are a going they are like a Watch,</HI> you need not wind them a∣bove once in twelve hours, for so long the <HI>thred of their tongues will be in spinning.</HI> A Dame of <HI>Paris</HI> came in a Coach with us from <HI>Roven,</HI> four∣teen hours we were together, of which time (Ile take my oath upon it) <HI>her tongue fretted away a eleven hours and fifty seven minutes</HI>; such ever∣lasting talkers are they all, that they will sooner want breath than words, and they are <HI>never silent but in the grave,</HI> which may also be doubted.</P>
<P>As they are endless in their talk, so are they also regardless of the comyany they speak in; be he stranger or of their acquaintance it much mat∣ters not; though indeed no man is to them a stranger, within an hour of the first sight you shall have them familiar more than enough; and <HI>as merry with you, as if they had known your bearing cloth.</HI> It may be they are chast, and I perswade my self many of them are; but you will hardly gather it out of there behaviour. <HI>Te tamen et cultus damnat,</HI> as <HI>Ausonius</HI> of an honest Woman, that carryed her self lesse modestly. They are abundantly full of laughter and toying, and are never without variety of lascivious songs, which they spare not to sing in whose company soever: you would think modesty were quite banished the Kingdom, or rather that it had never been there. Neither is this the weakness of some few, it is an <HI>Epidemicall disease</HI>: Maids and Wives are alike sick of it, though not both so desperately. The Galliards of the Mayds being of the two a little more tollerable; that of the Women coming hard
<PB N="58" REF="32"/>
upon the confines of shamelesness. As for the <HI>Ladies of the Court</HI> (I can speak this but upon hear-say) <HI>they are as much above them in their light∣ness, as they are in their place</HI>: and so much the worse, in that they have made their lightness impudent: for whereas the daughter of <HI>Pytha∣goras,</HI> being demanded what shamed her most to discourse of? made answer, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>▪ those parts which made her a Women: these <HI>French</HI> Dames will speak of them even in the hearing of men, as freely, and almost as broadly as a Midwife, or a Barbar Surgeon. Nay I have heard a Gentleman of good credence relate, that being at a Tilting, he saw a Courtier going to re∣move a boy, who very roguishly looked under a Ladies Cloathes; but when her Ladyship per∣ceived his intention, she hindered him with this Complement, <HI>Laisse Monsieur Laisse les yeux ne pas Larrons,</HI> the boyes would steal nothing. A very merciful and gentle Lady: if that of <HI>Justin</HI> be still true, <HI>Vera mulierum ornament a pudicitiam esse non vestes:</HI> that <HI>modesty were the best apparrel of a Woman</HI>; I am affraid many of the female sexe in <HI>France</HI> would be thinly clad, or else go naked.</P>
<P>Being a people thus prone to a sudden famili∣arity, and so prodigal of their tongues and compa∣ny; you would scarce imagine them to be coy of their lips; yet this is their humour. It seemed to me at first strange and uncivil, that a woman should turn away from the proffer of a salutation. After∣wards I liked the custom very well, and I had good cause for it; for it saved me from many <HI>an unsa∣voury peice of mannerliness,</HI> This notwithstanding
<PB N="59" REF="32"/>
could not but amaze me, that they who in their actions were so light and wanton, should yet think themselves modest; and confine all lasciviousness unto a kiss. A woman that is kissed, they account more than half whored, be her deportment never so becoming; which maketh them very sparing of receiving such kindnesses. But this is but a dissembled unwillingness, and hath somewhat in it of the <HI>Italian</HI>; As <HI>they had rather murther a man in private, than openly speak ill of him:</HI> so it may be thought, that these Damsels would hardly refuse a mans bed, though education hath taught them to fly from his lips. Night and the Curtains may conceal the one, the other can obtain no pardon in the eye of such as may happen to ob∣serve it.</P>
<P>Upon this ground your French Traveller, that perhaps may see his Hostess kissed at <HI>Dover</HI>; and see a Gentleman salute a Lady in the streets of <HI>London,</HI> relateth at his coming home strange Chy∣mera's of the English modesty: to further this si∣nister opinion, he will not spare to tell his Come∣rades (for this I have noted to you to be a part of his humour) what Merchants Wives he enjoyed at <HI>London,</HI> and in what familiarity such a Lady enter∣tained him at <HI>Westminster.</HI> Terrible untruths, and yet my poor Gallant thinketh he lieth not. I re∣member I met in <HI>Paris</HI> with an English Docter, and the Master of a Colledge there, who complained much of the lasciviousness of the English Women; and how infamously every French Taylor that came from us reported of them, withall he protest∣ed it did not much greive him; because he thought
<PB N="60" REF="33"/>
it a just judgement of God upon our Nation, that all the married men should thus suffer. <HI>A strange peice of Divinity to me,</HI> that never before heard such preaching. This was the occasion of the doctrine. In the old English <HI>Mass-book,</HI> called <HI>Secundum usum Sarum,</HI> the Woman at the time of marriage promiseth her future Husband to be bon∣ny and buxome at bed and at board till death us depart, &amp;c. This being too light for the gravity of the action then in hand; and in mine opinion somewhat less reverent than a Church duty would require; the Reformers of that Book thought good to alter, and thought fitter to <HI>put in, to love, cherish and obey.</HI> That this was a sufficient assurance of Conjugal faith he would not grant, because the promise of being buxome in bed was excluded. Besides, he accounted the supposed dishonesty of the English Wives as a vengeance plucked down on the heads of the people, for chopping and changing the words of the holy Sacrament (for such they esteem the form of Matrimony.) Though his argument needed no answer; yet his accusati∣on might expect one. And an English Gentleman (though not of the English faith) laid open the abuse, and seemed to speak it out of knowledge. When the <HI>Monsieurs</HI> came over full pursed to <HI>London,</HI> the French Pandars, which lay in wait for such booties, grow into their acquaintance, and promise them the imbraces of such a Dame of the City, or of such a Lady of the Court; Women per∣haps famed for admirable beauties. But <HI>as</HI> Ixion <HI>amongst the Poets expected</HI> Juno▪ <HI>and enjoyed a Cloud</HI>: So those beguiled wretches, instead of those
<PB N="61" REF="33"/>
eminent persons mentioned to them, take into their bosomes some of the common prostitutes of the Town. Thus are they cozened in their desires: thus do they lie in their reports: whilst, poor fools, they think themselves guilty of neither im∣posture.</P>
<P>For the other accusation, which would seem to fasten a note of immodesty upon our English Gentlewomens lips; I should be like enough to confess the crime, were the English kisses like unto those of the French. As therefore Doctor <HI>Bale</HI> Master of the Requests said unto <HI>Mendoza</HI> the Spa∣nish Embassador, upon his dislike of the promiscu∣ous sitting of men and women within our Church∣es, <HI>Turpe quidem id esse apud</HI> Hispanos, <HI>qui etiam in locis sacris cogitarent de explendâ libidine, a quâ pro∣cul aberant</HI> Anglorum <HI>mentes</HI>: So do I answer to the bill of the Complaint. An <HI>Oxford</HI> Doctor up∣on this Text, <HI>Betrayest thou the Son of man with a Kiss?</HI> made mention of four sorts of kisses, <HI>viz. Osculum charitatis, Osculum gratioris familiaritatis, Osculum calliditatis,</HI> and <HI>Osculum carnalitatis:</HI> Of these I will bestow the <HI>last on the French</HI>; and the <HI>third on the Spaniards,</HI> retaining the <HI>two first unto our selves</HI>: whereof the one is enjoyned by the precept, and the other warranted by the examples of holy Scriptures: For my part I see nothing in the innocent and harmless salutations of the Eng∣lish, which the Doctor calleth <HI>Oscula gratioris fa∣miliaritatis,</HI> that may move a French mans suspiti∣on; much, I confess, which may stir his envy▪ Perhaps a want of that happiness in himself maketh him to dislike it in us: as the Fox that had lost his
<PB N="62" REF="34"/>
tayl perswaded all others to cut off theirs. But I have already toucht the reason, why that Nation is unworthy of such a favour; their kisses being heat and sulphury; and indeed nothing but the <HI>Pro∣logue of their lust</HI>: whereas on the contrary, and I dare be confident in it, the chast and innocent kiss of the English Gentlewoman is more in Heaven, than many of their best devotions. It were not amiss to explain in this place a verse of <HI>Ovids,</HI> common in the mouthes of many, but in the under∣standing of few.
<Q><L>Oscula qui sumpsit, &amp; non &amp; caetera sumpsit</L>
<L>Hoec quoque quae sumpsit perdere dignus erat.</L>
<L>He that doth onely kiss, and doth no more,</L>
<L>Deserves to loose the kisses given before.</L></Q>
Which must be understood according to the fashi∣on of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> (and since of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>) where they were given as pawns of a dishonest contract, and not according to the cu∣stoms of <HI>England,</HI> where they are onely proffered in the way of a gratious and innocent familiarity, and so accepted,</P>
<P>I return again to the French women, and though <HI>I may not kiss them (which he that seeth them will have good cause to thank God for)</HI> yet they are at liberty to be courted: An office which they admit freely, and return as liberally: an office to which they are so used, that they can hardly distinguish complement from wooing, till the Priest expecteth them at the Church door: That day they set them∣selves forth with all the variety of riches their cre∣dit

can extend to: A Schollar of the University never disfurnished so many of his Freinds to pro∣vide for a journey, as they do neighbours to adorn that wedding. At my being at <HI>Pontoise</HI> I saw Mrs. <HI>Bride</HI> return from the Church; the day before she had been somewhat of the condition of a Kitchen wench, but now so <HI>tricked up with scarfes, rings and cross-garters,</HI> that <HI>you never saw a Whitson Lady better rigged:</HI> I should much have applauded the fellows fortunes, if he could have married the Clothes: but (God be merciful to him) he is chained to the Wench: Much joy may they have together most peerless couple.

She is an exceeding good soul (as <HI>Sancho Pancha</HI> said of his Wife) and one that will not pine her self, though her heirs smart for it. <HI>To her Husband she is</HI> very servile, seldom sitteth with him at the table, readily executing all his commands, and is <HI>indeed rather a married servant than a Wife,</HI> or <HI>a houshold drudge under the title of a Mistress.</HI> Yet on the other side she hath free∣dome enough, and certainly much more than a moderate wisedome would permit her. It is one of her <HI>iura conjugalia</HI> to admit of Courtship even in the sight of her Husband, to walk arm in arm about the streets, or in the fields, with her <HI>Pri∣vado,</HI> to proffer occasions of familiarity and ac∣quaintance at the first sight of one whose person she relisheth, and all this <HI>sans suspecion</HI> without the least imputation. A liberty somewhat of the largest, and we may justly fear, that having thus wholly in her own power the keys of the Cabinet, she sheweth her Jewels to more than her husband.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>France</HI> described: The Valley of <HI>Montmo∣rancie</HI> and the Dukes of it. <HI>Mont-Martyr.</HI> Burials in former times not permitted with∣in the Wals.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have now done with the <HI>French</HI> both Men and Womē: a people much extolled by many of the English Travellers for all those graces which may enoble and adorn both Sexes: For my part, having observed them as well as I could, and traced them
<PB N="67" REF="36"/>
in all their several humours, I set up my rest with this proposition, that <HI>there is nothing to be envied in them but their Country</HI>; To that indeed I am earn∣estly, and I think not unworthily affected: here being nothing wanting which may be required to raise and reward ones liking. If Nature were ever prodigal of her blessings, or scattered them with an over-plentiful hand, it was in this Island into which we were entred as soon as we were passed over the bridge of <HI>Pontoise.</HI> The first part of it, lasting for three leagues, was upon the plain of a Mountain, but such a Mountain as will hardly yeild to the best Valley in <HI>Europe</HI> out of <HI>France.</HI> On both sides of us the Vines grew up in a just length, and promised to the Husband-man a thriving vin∣tage. The Wines they yeild are far better than those of <HI>Normandy</HI> or <HI>Gascoyne,</HI> and indeed the best in the whole Continent, those of <HI>Orleans</HI> ex∣cepted; yet what we saw here was but as a bit to prepare our stomacks, least we should surfeit in the Valley.</P>
<P>Here we beheld Nature in her richest vestments. The fields enterchangeably planted with Wheat and Vines: That had <HI>L. Florus</HI> once beheld it, he would never have given unto <HI>Campania</HI> the title of <HI>Cereris &amp; Bacchi certamen.</HI> These fields were dis∣persedly here and there beset with Cherry-trees: which considered with the rest gave unto the eye an excellent object. For the Vines yet green, the Wheat ready for the sithe, and the Cherries now full ripened, and shewing forth their beauty through the vail of the leaves, made such a various and delightsome mixture of colours, that no art
<PB N="68" REF="37"/>
could have expressed it self more delectable. If you have ever seen an exquisite Mosaical work you may best judge of the beauty of this Valley. Add to this that the River <HI>Seine</HI> being now past <HI>Paris,</HI> either to embrace that flourishing soyl, or out of a wanton desire to play with it self, hath divided it self into sundry lesser channels, besides its several windings and turnings: So that one may very just∣ly, and not irreligiously conceive it to be an <HI>Idaea</HI> or <HI>representation of the Garden of Eden</HI>; the River so happily separating it self to water the ground. This Valley is a very large circuit. And as the Welch-men call <HI>Anglesea Mon Mam Gymry,</HI> that is, <HI>the Mother of Wales</HI>: so may we call this the <HI>Mother of Paris:</HI> for so abundantly doth it furnish that great and populous City, that when the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Bary</HI> and <HI>Burgundie</HI> besieged it with 100000. men, there being at that time three or 400000. Citizens and Souldiers within the wals, neither the people within, nor the enemy without, found any want of provision.</P>
<P>It is called the Valley of <HI>Montmorencie,</HI> from the Town and Castle of <HI>Montmorencie</HI> seated in it. But this Town nameth not the Valley onely; it giveth name also to the ancient family of the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Montmorencie,</HI> the <HI>ancientest house of Christendom.</HI> He stiled himself <HI>Lepremier Christien, &amp; plus vicil Baron du' France,</HI> and it is said, that his Ancestors received the faith of Christ by the preaching of St. <HI>Denis</HI> the first Bishop of <HI>Paris.</HI> Their princi∣pal houses are that of <HI>Chantilly</HI> and <HI>Ecqucan,</HI> both seated in the Isle: This last being given to this present Dukes Father by King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, to
<PB N="69" REF="37"/>
whom it was confiscated by the condemnation of one of his Treasurers. This house also (and so I beleive it) hath been observed to have yeilded to <HI>France</HI> more <HI>Constables, Marshals, Admirals,</HI> and the like Officers of power and command than any three other in the whole Kingdom, insomuch that I may say of it, what <HI>Irenicus</HI> doth of the <HI>Count Palatines,</HI> the names of the Countries onely chan∣ged: <HI>Non alia Galliae est familia cui plus debent no∣bilitus.</HI> The now Duke named <HI>Henry,</HI> is at this pre∣sent <HI>Admiral</HI> of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The most eminent place in all the Isle is <HI>Mont-Martyr,</HI> eminent I mean by reason of its height; though it hath also enough of antiquity to make it remarkable. It is seated within a mile of <HI>Paris,</HI> high upon a Mountain, on which many of the faith∣ful, during the time that <HI>Gaule</HI> was heathenish, were made <HI>Martyrs</HI>: Hence the name; though <HI>Paris</HI> was the place of apprehension and sentence, yet was this Mountain commonly the Scaffold of execution: It being the custom of the Ancients, <HI>neither to put to death, nor bury within the wals of their Cities.</HI> Thus the <HI>Jews</HI> when they crucified our Sa∣viour, led him out of the City of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> unto Mount <HI>Calvary</HI>: unto which St. <HI>Paul</HI> is thought to allude, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 13. saying, <HI>Let us therefore go forth to him,</HI> &amp;c. Thus also doth St. <HI>Luke</HI> (to omit other instances) report of St. <HI>Stephen, Acts</HI> 7. <HI>And they cast him out of the City and stoned him.</HI> So in the State of <HI>Rome</HI>; the <HI>Vestal Virgin</HI> having committed fornication was stifled in the <HI>Campus Sceleritatus</HI>; and other Malefactors thrown down the <HI>Tarpeian rock</HI>; both scituate without the Town.
<PB N="70" REF="38"/>
So also had the <HI>Thessalians</HI> a place of execution from the praecipice of an hill, which they called the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Corvi</HI>: whence arose the Proverb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>be hanged.</HI> As they permitted not execu∣tion of Malefactors within their wals: so neither would they suffer the best of their Citizens to be buried within them. This was it which made <HI>A∣braham</HI> to buy him <HI>a field wherein to bury his dead</HI>: and thus we read in the seventh of <HI>Luke,</HI> that the Widow of <HI>Naims</HI> Son was carried out to be buri∣ed. This custom also we find among the <HI>Athe∣nians, Corinthians</HI> and other of the <HI>Graecians; qui inagris suis</HI> (saith <HI>Alexander ab Alexandro) aut in fundo suburbano, ceuinavito aut patrio solo cor∣pora humari consuevere.</HI> Amongst the <HI>Romans</HI> it was once the fashion to burn the bodies of their dead within their City. This continued till the bringing in of the <HI>Laws of Athens,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Laws of the twelve Tables</HI>: one of which Laws runneth in these words. <HI>In urbe ne sepelito, neve drito.</HI> After this prohibition their dead corps were first <HI>burned in Campus Martius</HI>; and their Urnes covered in sundry places of the field. The frequent Urnes or sepulchral stones digged up a∣mongst us here in <HI>England</HI> are sufficient testimo∣nies of this assertion. Besides we may find in <HI>Ap∣pian,</HI> that the chief reason why the rich men in <HI>Rome</HI> would not yeild to the Law called <HI>Lex A∣grariae</HI> (for that Law divided the Roman possessi∣ons equally among the people) was, because they thought it an irreligious thing, that the Monuments of their fore-fathers should be sold to others. The first that is registred to have been buried in the
<PB N="71" REF="38"/>
City was <HI>Trajane</HI> the Emperor. Afterward it was granted as an honorary to such as had deserved well of the Republique. And when the Christian Religion prevailed; and Church-yards, those dor∣mitories of the Saints were consecrated, the liber∣ty of burying within the wals was to all equally granted.</P>
<P>On this ground it not being lawful to put to death or bury within the Town of <HI>Paris</HI>; this Mountain was destinate to these purposes: then was it onely a Mountain, now it is enlarged unto a Town. It hath a poor wall, an <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>Benedi∣ctine Monks,</HI> and a Chappel called <HI>La Chapelle des Martyrs:</HI> both founded by <HI>Lewis</HI> the sixth, called <HI>The Gross.</HI> Amongst others which received here the Crown of Martyrdom, none more famous than St. <HI>Denis</HI> (said to be <HI>Dionisius Areopagita</HI>) the first Bishop of <HI>Paris: Rusticus</HI> his Arch-preist, and <HI>Eleutherius</HI> his Deacon. The time when, under the raign of <HI>Domitian</HI>: the person by whose com∣mand <HI>Hesubinus</HI> Governour of <HI>Paris</HI>; the crime; for not bowing before the Altar of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and offering sacrifice unto him. Of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> being the <HI>Patron</HI> or <HI>Tutelary St. of France,</HI> the <HI>Legend</HI> reports strange wonders, as namely, when the Exe∣cutioner had smitten off his head, he caught it be∣tween his arms, and ran with it down the hill, as fast as his legs could bear him. Half a mile from the place of his execution he sate down, rested, and so he did nine times in all, even till he came to the place where his Church is now built. There he fell down and died, being <HI>three milee English from Mount Martyr</HI>; and there he was buried together
<PB N="72" REF="39"/>
with <HI>Rusticus</HI> and <HI>Eleutherius</HI>: who not being able to go as fast as he did, were brought after by the people. <HI>O impudentiam admirabilem &amp; verè Ro∣manam!</HI> and yet so far was the succeeding age pos∣sessed with a beleif of this miracle, that in the nine several places, where he is said to have rested, so many handsom crosses of stones there are erected: all of a making.</P>
<P>To the memory of this St. did <HI>Dagobert</HI> the first build a Temple, and the times ensuing improved it to a Town. Afterwards in honour of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> and because it lay near <HI>Paris,</HI> some of the follow∣ing Kings bestowed a wall upon it. A wall it is of a large circuit, and very much unproportionable to the Town which standeth in it; for all the world <HI>like a Spaniards little face in his great ruffe</HI>: or like a small chop of Mutton in a large dish of Pottage (at the three-penny ordinary.) Thus was the Town (as you see) built by means, but it was not so with the Temple: unless that be worth a Mira∣cle in the building and in the consecrating of it, I will not give a straw for it. Thus then saith the story: <HI>Dagobert</HI> afterwards King of <HI>France,</HI> during the life of <HI>Clotarre</HI> the second his Father, had cru∣elly slain <HI>Sadrasagille</HI> his Governor. To avoid the fury of his Father, much incensed with that un∣princely action, he was compelled to wander up and down <HI>France,</HI> hungry and thirsty: And as he went, and he went (for this tale should be told in the same stile that Wenches tell theirs by the fires side) till he came to the <HI>Sepulcher of St. Denis</HI>; where he laid himself down and slept: and then there appeared unto him a fine old man, with a
<PB N="73" REF="39"/>
staffe in his hand, and he told him, that his Father was dead; and that he should be King: and he prayed him of all loves, that when he came to be King, he would build a <HI>Church</HI> there, <HI>to the honour of St. Denis.</HI> He had an hard heart, that could deny so sweet an old man so little a curtesie for so much good news: and I trow he was more kind than so. And so when the Church was built, the Bishop was sent for in all hast to bless it. But it chanced the night before the day wherein the Bi∣shop was to bless it, there came to the Town an ugly Leper, and the foulest that ever was seen. And this Leper would needs lie in the Church: and when he was there, about twelve a clock in the night our <HI>Saviour</HI> came to the Church in garments as white as the driven snow. There came with him the <HI>Apostles,</HI> the <HI>Angels,</HI> and the <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and the sweetest musick that ever was heard in the world. Then <HI>Christ blessed the Church</HI>; and said unto the Leper, that he should tell the Bishop that the Church was already blessed: and for a token of it, he gave the Leper his health: who presently be∣came as fine a sweet youth as one should see in a summers day. <HI>Auditam admisse risu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teneatis?</HI> you may laugh if you please, but I will assure you this is the story: Neither is it a jot the less authentical be∣cause of the stile. Such ridiculous stuffe did the <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Friers</HI> of those times invent to please and blind the people. So prone were our Ance∣stors to <HI>beleive as Oracles</HI> whatever was delivered unto them by these <HI>Impostors. Majoribus nostris tam facilis in mendaciis fides fuit, ut temere credid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt illa monstrosa mira<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ula: &amp; quicquid famae licet
<PB N="74" REF="40"/>
fingere, illis erat libenter audire. Minutius Felix</HI> spake it of his fore-fathers being Heathens, we may affirm it of ours also being Christians.</P>
<P>But (to omit the additions of the Legend) true it is, that <HI>Dagobert</HI> was the <HI>first Founder</HI> of the Church: which was afterward rebuilt and beauti∣fied by the twenty fifth Abbot of it, called <HI>Sugger,</HI> in the raign of King <HI>Lewis</HI> the sixth. A reverent and comely Fabrick certainly it is: Dark, as the Churches of those times commonly were, and none of the poorest. It maintaineth sixty two <HI>Monks</HI> and an <HI>Abbot,</HI> whose single revenue is thought to be <HI>worth ten thousand Crowns</HI> and upward. The present Abbot is <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> Son to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Guise,</HI> a young Gentleman of some four∣teen years of age, or thereabouts: but of him more hereafter. The Abbot of it, among many other priviledges, hath a full power upon the lives, goods, and honours of his vassals; and hath a voice in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> as full and binding as any of the Counsellors there sitting. As for the Church it self, it is in height eighty foot, an hundred in breadth, and in length three hundred. The <HI>high Altar,</HI> under which the bodies of Saint <HI>Denis</HI> and his two fellow Martyrs are said to be buried, is a very rich and excellent work: the <HI>Crucifix</HI> stand∣ing over it being all of pure gold, embos'd with divers pearls and pretious stones of great value. Before it hangeth a silver Lamp continually burning; and if you look about it, you shall see the richest and the fairest glass for painting in all <HI>France,</HI> that of <HI>Amiens</HI> onely excepted; one thing I will further note in this Church, before I come to
<PB N="75" REF="40"/>
the Tombs and Reliques; which is, how <HI>Henry the fourth in this Church said his first Mass</HI> after his last reconcilement to the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>: and good reason I have to say his last: For having first been brought up in the Romish faith; he was by his Mother made a <HI>Protestant.</HI> At the Massacre of <HI>Paris,</HI> fear of death or imprisonment turned him <HI>Papist.</HI> Liberty made him again an <HI>Hugonot.</HI> In this he continued till the year 1595. And then once more <HI>re-embosom'd himself in the Roman Sy∣nagogue,</HI> which was the time we now speak of. <HI>Quo teneam nodo mutantem protea vultum</HI>? the onely <HI>Proteus</HI> in matters of faith of our times, Doctor <HI>Perne,</HI> was a diamond to him.</P>
<P>It is now time I should shew you the <HI>Reliques</HI>: but you must first stay till the Clerk hath put on his Surplice. I have heard of a blind Priest, that could never mumble over his Mass without his spectacles: this <HI>fellow and his Surplice</HI> is just like him. I perswade my self, that the Surplice without the Clark could marshal the Reliques, as well as the Clark without the Surplice. As soon as he was sadled for his journey, he put himself into his way, and followed it with a pace so nimbly, that there was no keeping of him company. His tongue ran so fast, that the quickest eye there was fain to give him over in plain ground: the fellow that sheweth the <HI>Tombs</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> being no more to be compared to him for the volubility of his chops, than a <HI>Capouchin</HI> to a <HI>Jesuite</HI>: yet as we learned af∣terwards of him, when he was out of his road, they were thus disposed. On the right hand of the Altar (not that high Altar above mentioned) there are
<PB N="76" REF="41"/>
said to be kept one of the <HI>nails</HI> which fastened our Saviour to the Cross. Secondly, a <HI>peice of the Cross</HI> it self. Thirdly, some of the <HI>Virgin Maries Milk.</HI> Fourthly, the <HI>arm of St. Simeon</HI> set in a case of gold. And fiftly, the <HI>Reliques of St. Lewis</HI> reserved in a little Chappel, all of gold also, and built after the fashion of <HI>Nostre-dame</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> On the left there was shewed us the <HI>head of St. Denis,</HI> and a part of his body: But I mistake my self, it was not the head, but the Portraiture in gold; the head being said to be within it. By this representation he seemeth to have had a very reverend and awful counte∣nance; though I perswade my self, that the rich Crown Miter which he there weareth (and cer∣tainly they are of an high value) never belonged to him in his life. On each side of the head are two Angels supporting it, reported to be the work of one <HI>Ely Le plus artiste orfeure de son temps</HI>: the cunningst Gold-smith of his time, who afterwards was made Bishop of <HI>Noyon</HI> and Sainted.</P>
<P>Concerning Reliques I shall have occasion to speak further, when I come to the <HI>holy Chappel in Paris</HI>: somewhat now of the honour due unto the memory of Martyrs. I am none of those that think the memories of those Heroes of the Primi∣tive times not to be honoured in the dust. Neither would I assault their shrines with an irreverent fin∣ger. On the other side, they shall never have my prayers directed to them, nor my devotions: nor can I think it lawful to give the remnants of them any bodily observance: though I do and will ho∣nour, yet I dare not worship them. St. <HI>Austin</HI> hath cut out the mid-way between the <HI>Papists</HI> and
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
the <HI>Zelots,</HI> in the eighth book of his most excellent work <HI>de Civitate Dei,</HI> and his path it is best to fol∣low: <HI>Honoramus sane memorias eorum, tanquam Sanctorum hominum Dei, qui usque ad mortem suo∣rum corporum pro veritate certarunt.</HI> And a little after, he sheweth the end of these memorials: <HI>viz. Ʋt ea celebritate Deo vero gratias de eorum victoriis agamus, &amp; nos ad imitationem talium coronarum eorum memoriae revocatione adhortemur.</HI> One Re∣lique there is, of which this use cannot possibly be made, and what do you think that should be, but the <HI>Lanthorn</HI> which <HI>Judas</HI> used when he went to apprehend his Master. A pretty one I confess, it is richly beset with studs of Christal, through which all the light cometh, the main of it being of a sub∣stance not transparent. Had it been shewed me within the first Century of years after the Passion, I might have perhaps been fooled into a beleif, for I am confident it can be no elder. Being as it is, I will acknowledge it to be a Lanthorn, though it belonged not to <HI>Judas.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Reliques of Martyrs,</HI> proceed we to those of <HI>Kings,</HI> and amongst those there is nothing which will long detain an English man. He that hath seen the <HI>Tombs</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> will think those to be but trifles: if he consider the workmanship, or the riches and the magnificence. The cheif of those mean ones which are there, are those of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the second, and <HI>Katherine de Medices</HI> his Wife, in a little Chappel of her own building, both in their full proportion, and in their royal habiliments exceeding stately. Here is also a neat <HI>Tomb</HI> of the same <HI>Henry built all of brass,</HI> and supported by four
<PB N="78" REF="42"/>
brass pillars. His statue of the same mettal placed on the top of it, and composed as if at his prayers. The rest are more in tale than weight: but the chiefest beauties of the Church are in the <HI>Treasu∣ry,</HI> which was not mine happiness to see. As I am imformed, the most remarkable things in it are these. The <HI>Swords</HI> of <HI>Joan</HI> the Virgin, <HI>Charles</HI> the great, <HI>Rowland</HI> his Cozen, and that of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth when he was crowned. His Boots, Crowns and Scepters, as those of his Son now raigning. A <HI>Cross</HI> of three foot high made of pure gold: A Crown, Scepter and golden Ball given by <HI>Pope Adrian</HI> to <HI>Carolus Magnus</HI>: A golden Crown of a larger size be decked with adamants and other pretious stones, given by <HI>Charles Martell</HI> after his victory over the <HI>Saracens</HI>: A very fair <HI>Chalice</HI> all of gold, in which St. <HI>Denis</HI> is said to have conse∣crated the Sacramental Wine. The others of les∣ser note I purposely omit: for having not seen them, I am loath to go any further upon trust. And so I leave St. <HI>Denis,</HI> a Church so richly furnished, that had I seen all the rarities and glory of it, that onely dayes content had deserved our journey; <HI>Sed haec infaelici nimia,</HI></P>
<P>Not to continue this discourse any further by way of <HI>journal,</HI> or <HI>gesta dierum</HI>; some few dayes after we had wearied our selves with the sight of <HI>Paris,</HI> we went to see some of their Majesties hou∣ses in the Country; and here we passed by <HI>Madrit,</HI> so called of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> house at <HI>Madrit</HI>▪ after the form of which it is built. The Founder of it was <HI>Francis</HI> the first, who being taken priso∣ner at the <HI>ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tel of Pavi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Anno</HI> 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. and thence

carried into <HI>Spain,</HI> had no less than a twelve-moneths leisure to draw that platform. A fine contrived house it seemed to be; but our journey lay beyond it: One league beyond it lay <HI>Ruall,</HI> a small Town belonging to the Abbey of St. <HI>Denis.</HI> In the corner of this Town, the <HI>Queen Mother</HI> hath a fine summer house, abundantly adorned with re∣tired walks, and a most curious variety of Water-works: For besides the forms of divers glasses, pil∣lars and geometrical figures, all framed by the wa∣ter, there were birds of sundry forts so artificially made, that they both deceived the eye by their mo∣tion, and the ear by their melody: Somewhat higher, in the midst of a most delicious garden, are two <HI>Fountains</HI> of admirable workmanship. In the first the Portraitures of <HI>Cerberus,</HI> the <HI>Bore</HI> of <HI>Calidon,</HI> the <HI>Naemean Lyon,</HI> and in the navel of it <HI>Hercules</HI> killing <HI>Hydra.</HI> In the other onely a <HI>Crocodile</HI> full of wild and unruly tricks, and send∣ing from his throat a musick not far different from Organs. Had your eyes been shut, you would have thought your self in some Cathedral Church: this melody of the <HI>Crocodile,</HI> and that other of the Birds, so exactly counterfeiting the harmony of a well ordered Quire. And now we are come into the <HI>Grove,</HI> a place so full of retired walks, so sweetly and delectably contrived, that they would even en∣tice a man to melancholy; because in them even melancholy would seem delightful. The trees so interchangeably folded the one within the other, that they were at once a shelter against wind and sun, yet not not so sullenly close, but that they af∣forded the eye an excellent Lordship over the
<PB N="80" REF="43"/>
vines, and verdures of the earth imprisoned within them. It seemed a Grove, an Orchard, and a Vine∣yard, so variously enterwoven and mixed together, as if it had been the purpose of the Artist to make a man fall in love with confusion. In the middle of the wilderness was seated the <HI>house,</HI> environed round about with a moat of running water; the house pretty and therefore little, built rather for a banquet than a feast. It was built and thus enrich∣ed with variety of pleasures by <HI>Mr. de Ponte</HI> Tay∣lor to King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and was, no question, the best garment he ever cut out in his life. Dying he gave it to <HI>Mr. Landerbone,</HI> once his servant, and now his Son by adoption, of whom the <HI>Queen Mother,</HI> taking a liking to it, bought it, giving in exchange an Office in the Treasury worth 400000 Crowns to be sold.</P>
<P>Two leagues from <HI>Ruall</HI> is the Kings house of St. <HI>Germanenly,</HI> an house seated on the top of an hill, just like <HI>Windsore.</HI> The Town of St. <HI>Germain</HI> lyeth all round about it: the River <HI>Reine</HI> (of the same breadth as the <HI>Thames</HI> is at the place mentioned) runneth below it; and the house, by reason of the scite, having a large command of the Country round about it. The Town is poor, and hath no∣thing in it remarkable but the name, which it took from St. <HI>Germain</HI> Bishop of <HI>Auxerre,</HI> who toge∣ther with St. <HI>Lupus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Troyes</HI> sailed into <HI>Britain</HI> to root out <HI>Pelagianisme.</HI> The Castle or Seat royal is divided into two parts, the old &amp; the new. The old, which is next unto the Town, is built of brick and for form it is triangular. Founded it was at the first by <HI>Charles</HI> the first, since strengthened
<PB N="81" REF="43"/>
and beautified by the <HI>English,</HI> when it was in their possession. <HI>Francis</HI> the first added to it the upper story, and the battlements, and <HI>in memoriam facti</HI> hath left a <HI>Capital F.</HI> upon every of the chimneys. The new house distant from the old about a fur∣long, and to Which you descend by a handsome green Court. It was built by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth. It consists of three several parts all joyned together, the two outermost quadrangular; that in the mid∣dle almost round, and in the fashion of a Jewish Synagogue. Here we saw the <HI>Volatory</HI> full of sun∣dry forrein Birds, and in one of the lowest rooms great store of out-landish Coins, but these were but accessories. The principal was the majesty of the house, which is indeed worth the observa∣tion. The Palace of the <HI>Lou're</HI> so much famed, is not to be named the same day with that. The rooms are well ordered and well roofed: gorgeously set out with the curiosity of the Painter. In some of the Chambers they shewed us some poetical ficti∣ons, expressed by the pencil in the windows, and on the wainscot, and seemed to glory much in them. I confess they might plentifully have possessed my fancy, had I not seen the Window in <HI>Gorrambury</HI> gallery, belonging to the right Honorable <HI>Francis Viscount St. Albons,</HI> a Window, in which all the <HI>Fables</HI> of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> are so naturally and lively resembled, that if ever Art went beyond it self, it was in that admirable expression.</P>
<P>Let us now take a veiw of the <HI>Water-works,</HI> and here we shall see in the first Water-house (which is a stately large walk, vaulted over head) the effi∣gies of a <HI>Dragon</HI> just against the entrance. An
<PB N="82" REF="44"/>
unquiet Beast, that vomiteth on all that come nigh it. At the end toward the right hand is the statue of a <HI>Nymph</HI> sitting before a pair of Organs. Upon the loosing of one of the pipes the Nymphs fin∣gers began to manage the keys, and brought the instrument to yeild such a musick, that if it were not that of an Organ, it was like it as could be, and not be the same: Unto the division of her fingers her head kept a proportionable time, jolting from one shoulder to the other: as I have seen an old Fid∣ler at a Wake. In the same partition were the coun∣terfeits of all sorts of mils, w<SUP>ch</SUP> before very eagerly discharged their functions, but upon the beginning of the harmony they suddenly stood still, as if they had ears to have heard it. At the other end toward the left hand we saw a shop of Smiths, another of Joyners, and backsides full of Sawyers and Ma∣sons, all idle: upon the first command of the water they all fell to their occupations, and plied them lustily: the Birds every where by their singing sa∣ving the Artificers the labour of whistling. Besides upon the drawing of a wooden curtain, there ap∣peared unto us two <HI>Tritons</HI> riding on their Dol∣phins, and each of them with a shell in his hand, which interchangeably and in turns served them in¦stead of Trumpets. A very happy <HI>decorum,</HI> and truly poetical.
<Q><L>Caeruleum Tritona vocat, conchâque sonanti</L>

Afterwards follows <HI>Neptune</HI> himself sitting in his Chariot drawn with four Tortises, and grasping his
<PB N="83" REF="44"/>
<HI>Tricuspis</HI> or threefold Scepter in his hand; the water under them representing all the while a Sea somewhat troubled. Thirty six steps from the front of the house we descended into this Water-house, and by sixty more descended into a second of the same fashion, but not of an equal length with the other. At the right hand of this, is the whole story of <HI>Perseus</HI> and <HI>Andromeda,</HI> and the whole lively acted: the Whale being killed and the Lady loosed from the rock very perfectly. But withall it was so cunningly mannaged, and that with such mutual change of fortune on the parts of both the Com∣batants, that one who had not known the Fable, would have been sore afraid, that the Knight would have lost the victory, and the Lady her life. At the other end there was shewed unto us,
<Q>Orpheus in silvis positus, silvaeque sequentes.</Q>
I say, there appeared unto us the resemblance of <HI>Orpheus</HI> playing on a treble Violl; the trees mo∣ving with the force of the musick, and the wild Beasts dancing in two rings about him. An inven∣tion which could not but cost King <HI>Henry</HI> a great sum of money; one string of the Fiddle being by mischance broken, having cost King <HI>Lewis</HI> his Son 1500. Livers. Upon the opening of a double leafed door, there were exhibited unto us divers representations and conceits: which certainly might have been more graceful, if they had not had so much in them of a Pudpet-play. By some thirty steps more we descended into the Garden; and by as many more into a Green, which opened into
<PB N="84" REF="45"/>
the water sides: In which the goodliest Flower and most pleasing to mine eye, was the statue of an Horse in brass, of that bigness, that I and one of my companions could stand on the neck of him; but dismounting from this Horse we mounted our own, and so took our leaves of Saint <HI>Ger∣main.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the other side of <HI>Paris</HI> and up the River, we saw another of the Kings Houses called Saint <HI>Vincent,</HI> or <HI>Vincennes.</HI> It was beautified with a large Park by <HI>Philip Augustus, An.</HI> 1185. who also wal∣led the Park and replenished it with Deer. In this House have died many famous personages, as <HI>Phi∣lip the fair, Lewis Hutin,</HI> and <HI>Charles the fair,</HI> but none so much to be lamented as that of our <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the fifth, cut down in the flower of his age, and the middest of his victories. A man most truly valiant, and the <HI>Alexander</HI> of his times. Not far from thence is an old Castle, once strong, but time hath made it now unserviceable. The people call it <HI>Chasteau bisestre</HI> corruptly for <HI>Vincester,</HI> which maketh me beleive it was built by the English when they were Masters of this Isle.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE are now come to <HI>Paris,</HI> whether indeed I should have brought you the same day we came from <HI>Pontoise.</HI> It hath had in several ages two several names; the one taken from the people, the other from the scituation. The name taken from the people is that of <HI>Paris: Julius Caesar</HI> in his Commentaries making mention of the Nation of the <HI>Parisii</HI>: and at that time calling the City <HI>Ʋrbem pacisiorum: Amianus Marcellinus</HI> calleth it by the same name appellative: for as yet the name of <HI>Paris</HI> was not appropriated to it. As for these <HI>Parisii,</HI> it is well known that they were a people of <HI>Gallia Celtica</HI>: but why the people were so called hath been questioned, and that deserved∣ly. Some derive them from a Son of <HI>Paris</HI> the Son of <HI>Priam:</HI> but the humor of deriving all na∣tional originations from <HI>Troy,</HI> hath long since been hissed out of the School of Antiquity: The <HI>Berosus</HI> of <HI>John Annins</HI> bringeth them from one <HI>Paris</HI> King of the <HI>Celtae</HI>: and this authority is a∣like authentical: The bastards which this <HI>Annius</HI> imposed upon the ancient Writers, are now taught to know their own Fathers. Others deduce it from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a Greek word, importing <HI>boldness in speech,</HI> which is approved by <HI>William Breton</HI> in the first book of his <HI>Philippiades.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="86" REF="46"/>
<LG>
<L>Finibus egressi patriis per Gallica rura</L>

<L>Et se Parisios dixerant, nomine Graeco:</L>
<L>Quod sonat expositum nostris audacia, verbis.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Leaving their native Soil, they sought through <HI>Gaule</HI></L>
<L>A place to build a City and a Wall:</L>
<L>And call'd themselves <HI>Parisians</HI>: which in Greek</L>
<L>Doth note a prompt audacity to speak.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>It is spoken of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> who coming out of the more Southern parts here planted themselves Neither is it improbable, that a <HI>Gallick</HI> Nation should assume unto it self a Greek name; that language having taken good footing in these parts long before and <HI>sans time</HI>; as himself testifieth in his Commentaries. How well this name agreeth with the French nature, I have already manifested, in the character of this people both Men and Wo∣men: But I will not stand to this Etymology. The names of great Cities are obscure, as those of their Founders: and the conjecturall derivations of them are oftentimes rather plausible than proba∣ble, and sometimes neither. As for the antiquity of it, it is said to have been built in the time of <HI>Amaziah King of Judah</HI>; but this also is uncer∣tain, the beginnings of ancient Cities being as dark and hidden as their names. Certain it is, that it is no <HI>puisne</HI> in the world, it being a strong and opu∣lent Town in the dayes of <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>The other name of the City, which indeed is the ancient, and was taken from the scituation of it, is <HI>Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etia</HI> from <HI>Lutum,</HI> Durt; as being seated in an
<PB N="87" REF="46"/>
exceeding clammy and durty soyl. To this also consenteth the above named <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Bre∣ton</HI> in his said first book of his <HI>Philippiades,</HI> saying.
<Q><LG>
<L>— Quoniam tunc temporis illam</L>
<L>Reddebat palus, &amp; terrae pinguaedo lutosam</L>
<L>Aptam Parisii posuere Lutetia nomen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And since the Fens and clammy soyl did make</L>
<L>Their City dirty: for that reasons sake</L>
<L>The Town the name <HI>Lutetia</HI> did take.</L>
</LG></Q>
As for the Etymology of <HI>Munster,</HI> who derived the name from <HI>Paris</HI> one of the Kings of <HI>Celtae,</HI> it may (for ought that I know) deservedly keep company with that of <HI>Berosus</HI> already recited. This name of <HI>Lutetia</HI> continued till the coming of the <HI>Franks</HI> into these parts, who to endear the Nation of the <HI>Parisii,</HI> and oblige them more faith∣fully to do them service, commanded it for ever after to be called <HI>Paris.</HI> But the scituation of the Town gave it not onely the name, it gave it also (as the custom of Godfathers is in <HI>England</HI>) a Christening gift, which is the riches of it, and by consequence the preeminence. In how delicate and flourishing a soyl it is scituate, I have already told you in my description of the valley of <HI>Mont∣morencie</HI> wherein it standeth. If you will beleive <HI>Comines</HI> in the first book of his History, he will tell you, that (<HI>'est la cite que iamais ie veisse environn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e de meilleux pais &amp; plantureux:</HI> of all the Cities which ever he saw, it is environned with the best
<PB N="88" REF="47"/>
and fruitfullest Country. The River of <HI>Seine</HI> is also no question a great help to the enriching of it: though it be not navigable to the Town; yet it giveth free passage unto Boats of an indifferent bigg burden; into which the Ships are unladen, and so their commodities carryed up the water: A profitable entercourse between the Sea and the City for the <HI>Merchants.</HI> Of these Boats there are an infinite company, which ply up and down the water, and more indeed (as the said <HI>Comin∣ces</HI> is of opinion) than any man can beleeve, that hath not seen them.</P>
<P>It is in circuit (as <HI>Boterus</HI> is of opinion) twelve miles; others judge it at ten: for my part I dare not guesse it to be above eight, and yet I am told by a <HI>French man</HI> that it was in compasse no less than fourteen Leagues within the Walls: an un∣truth bigger than the Towne. For figure it is <HI>circular</HI>; that being (according to the <HI>Geome∣tricians</HI>) of all figures the most capacious. And questionless if it be true that <HI>Ʋrbs non in maenibus sed in civibus posita est, Paris</HI> may chalenge as great a circuit, as the most of <HI>Europe</HI>; it being little inferiour to the biggest for the multitude of her inhabitants. Joyn the compass and the populous∣ness together, and you shall hear the wisest of the <HI>French</HI> men say, <HI>Que ce qu'est l' ame a la rai∣sen, et la prunet a locit, cela mesme est Paris a la France.</HI> Adde to this the virdict of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, who being demanded which he thought to be the biggest <HI>City of France,</HI> answered <HI>Roven:</HI> and being then asked what he though of <HI>Paris,</HI> made answer, <HI>Ʋn Pàis,</HI> that it was a whole Coun∣try;
<PB N="89" REF="47"/>
the <HI>Emperour</HI> did well to flatter <HI>Francis</HI> the first, who asked him these questions, and in whose power he then was: otherwise he might have gi∣ven men good cause to suspect his judgement. The truth is that <HI>Paris</HI> is a fayr and goodly Town, yet withal it is no thing like the miracle that some make it. Were the figure of <HI>London</HI> altered, and all the houses of it cast into a ring, I dare able it a <HI>larger and more goodly Town than Paris,</HI> and that in the comparison, it may give it at the least half a mile oddes.</P>
<P>For matter of strength and resistance certain it is, that this <HI>City</HI> is exceeding well seated, were it as well fortified. It lyeth in a plain flat and levell, and hath no hills nigh unto it, from which it can any way be annoyed: and for the casting and making of rowling Trenches, I think the soyle is hardly serviceable. If Art were no more wanting to the strengh of it than Nature, in mine opinion it might be made almost impregnable. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, seeing the present weakness of it, had once a purpose (as it is said) to have strenthened it according to the moderne Art of fortifications: but it went no further than the purpose. He was a great builder, and had may projects of Masonry in his head, which were little for his profit; and this would have proved less than any: for besides the infinite sums of money, which would have been employed in so immense a work; what had this been in effect, but to put a sword into a mad mans hand. The oft mutinies and seditions of this people hath made it little inferiour to <HI>Laigh,</HI> or <HI>Gaunt,</HI> the two most revolting Townes in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="48"/>
And again, the <HI>Baracadoes</HI> against the per∣son of <HI>King Henry</HI> the third, and the long resist∣ance it made to himself being weak, were sufficient to instruct him, what might be expected from it by his <HI>Successors,</HI> when it should be strengthened and enabled to rebellion.</P>
<P>The present strength of the Town then is not great, the walles being very weak and ruinous; and those other few helps which it hath being little available for defence. The beautifullest part of the whole resistance is the Ditch, deep, praecipitate, and broad; and to say no more of it, an excellent ward were there any thing else correspondent to it. As for the <HI>Fort</HI> next to St. <HI>Antonies</HI> gate called the <HI>Bastille,</HI> it is in my con∣ceit too little to protect the Town, and too low to command it. When Swords onely and Pick-axes were in use, and afterwards in the infancy of Gunnes, it did some service in the Nature of of a <HI>Fortresse</HI>; now it onely serveth as a <HI>Prison,</HI> principally for those of the greater sort, who will permit themselves to be taken. It is said to be built by the <HI>English,</HI> when they were <HI>Lords of Paris:</HI> and the <HI>Vulgar</HI> are all of this opinion. O∣thers of the more learned sort, make it to be the work of one of the <HI>Provosts</HI> of the <HI>City Du Chesne</HI> calleth him <HI>Hugues Ambriott,</HI> in the time of <HI>Char∣les</HI> the fifth, when as yet the <HI>English</HI> had nothing to do here. The word <HI>Bastille</HI> in general is a <HI>Fortresse</HI>; the article <HI>la</HI> prefixed before it maketh it a name, and appropriateth it to this building. There are also two little turrets just against the Gallery of the <HI>Louure</HI> on both sides of the <HI>Seine,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="48"/>
intended for the defence of the River; though now they are little able to answer that intention. They also are fathered on the <HI>English</HI>; but how true I know not. Another place I marked, de∣signed perhaps for a <HI>Rampart,</HI> but employed on∣ly at this time by Wind-mills: it is a goodly mount of earth, high and capacious, scituate close unto the gate called <HI>St. Martin,</HI> the most defensible part (if well manned) of all <HI>Paris.</HI> Thus is the strength of this Town (as you see) but small, and if <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, lay so long before it with his Army, it was not because he could not take it, but because he would not: <HI>He was loath</HI> (as <HI>By∣ron</HI> advised him,) <HI>to receive the bird naked,</HI> which he expected with all his feathers: and this answer he gave to my Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who undertook to force an entry into it.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Streets</HI> they are made of a lawfull and competent bredth, well pitched under the foot with fair and large Pebble: This paving of it was the work of <HI>Philip Augustus, Anno</HI> 1223. or there∣bouts: before which time it could not but be mi∣serably dirty, if not unpassable. As it now is, the least <HI>rain maketh it very slippery and trouble∣some,</HI> and as little a continuance of <HI>warm wea∣ther, stinking and poisononus:</HI> But whether this noysomness proceed from the nature of the ground, or the sluttishness of the people in their houses, or the neglect of the Magistrates in not providing a sufficiency of <HI>Scavingers,</HI> or all, I am not to determine. This I am confident of, that the <HI>nastiest Lane in London, is Frankincense and Juniter to the sweetest Street in this City.</HI> The an∣cient
<PB N="92" REF="49"/>
by-word was (and there is good reason for it) <HI>Il destaint come la fange de Paris.</HI> Had I the power of making Proverbs, I would only change <HI>Il destaint, into Il puit,</HI> and make the <HI>by-word</HI> ten times more Orthodoxe. I have spoken somewhat of the <HI>Fortifications</HI> of this Town, but they are but triflles: the only <HI>venome</HI> of the Streets is a strength unto it more powerful, than the ditches or the Bullwark of <HI>St. Martin, Morison</HI> in his <HI>Itinera∣ry</HI> relateth how the <HI>Citizens</HI> of <HI>Prague in Bohe∣mia</HI> were reparing the walls of the Town for fear of the <HI>Turks</HI>: but withal he addeth, that if the stink of the Streets kept him not thence, there was assurance to be looked for of the walls: I know not now how true it is of that <HI>City</HI>; I am sure it may be justly verified upon this. It was therefore not injudiciously said of an <HI>English Gen∣tleman,</HI> that he thought <HI>Paris</HI> was the <HI>strongest Town in Christendome</HI>: for he took strong in that sense, as we do in <HI>England,</HI> when we say, such a man hath a strong breath. These things consi∣dered, it could not but be an infinite happinesse granted by Nature to our <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, that he never stopped his nose at any stink, as our <HI>Chro∣nicles</HI> report of him; otherwise in my conscience he had never been able to have kept his <HI>Court</HI> here. But that which most amazeth me is, that in such a perpetuated constancy of stinks, there should yet be found, so large and admirable a va∣riety; a variety so specifical and distinct, that any <HI>Chymicall</HI> nose (I dare lay my life on it) after two or three perambulations, would hunt out blindfold each several street by the smell; as per∣fectly
<PB N="93" REF="49"/>
as another by his eye. A Town of a strange composition: one can hardly live in it in the Summer without poisoning, in the Winter with∣out myring.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Buildings,</HI> they are I confess very hand∣somly and uniformly set out to the street ward; not unseemly in themselves and very suitable one with another: high and perpendicular, with windowes reaching almost from the top to the bottome. The houses of the new mould in <HI>London</HI> are just after their fashion, wherein the care and designe of our late <HI>Soveraigne King James,</HI> is highly to be magnified. Time and his good beginnings well seconded will make that City nothing inferiour for the beauty and excellency of her structures, to the gallantest of <HI>Europe.</HI> Insomuch that he might truly have said of his <HI>London</HI> what <HI>Augustus</HI> did of his <HI>Rome.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: as <HI>Dyon</HI> hath it, <HI>Ʋrbem quam la∣teritiam inveni marmoreum relenquo.</HI> But as <HI>Lon∣don</HI> now is, the houses of it in the inside are both better contrived, and more richly furnished by farre, than those of <HI>Paris</HI>: the inward beautie and ornaments most commonly following the e∣state of the builders or owners. Their houses are distinguished by Signes, as with us, and under every signe there is printed in Capital Letters what signe it is: neither is it more than needs. The old shift off, This is a <HI>Cock,</HI> and This is a <HI>Bull,</HI> was never more requisite in the infancy of Painting, than in this City, for so hideously, and so without resemblance to the thing signified, are most of these <HI>Pencill Works,</HI> that I may without
<PB N="94" REF="50"/>
danger say of them as <HI>Psuedalus implautus</HI> doeh of the Letter which was written from <HI>Phaenicium</HI> to his young Mr. <HI>Callidorus: An absecro herclé ha∣bent quoque gallinae manus: nam has quidem galli∣na scripsit.</HI> If a Hen would not scrape better <HI>Portraictures</HI> in a Dunghil, than they have hang∣ed up before their doors, I would send her to my <HI>Hostesse of Tostes,</HI> to be executed.</P>
<P>And indeed generally the <HI>Artificers</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> are as slovenly in their Trades, as in their houses; yet you may find nimble dancers, pretty Fidlers for a toy, and a Taylor that can trick you up after the best and newest fashion. Their Cutlers make such abominable and fearfull knives as would grieve a mans heart to see them; and the Glovers are worse than they: you would imagine by their Gloves, that the hand for which they were made were cut off by the wrest; yet on the other side, they are very perfect at Tooth-picks, Beard-bru∣shes, and (which I hold the most commendable Art of them) the cutting of a Seal. Their Mer∣cers are but one degree removed from a Pedler; such as in <HI>England</HI> we call <HI>Chapmen</HI>; that is, a Pedler with a shop: and for <HI>Goldsmiths</HI> there is little use for them, Glasses there being most in re∣quest; both because neat and because cheap: I perswade my self that the two several ranks of shops in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> can show more Plate, and more variety of Mercery warres, good and rich, than three parts of <HI>Paris. Merchants</HI> they have but not many; and those which they have not very wealthy. The River ebbs not and floweth, not nigher them than fifteen miles or thereabouts;

and the Boats which thence serve the <HI>City,</HI> be no bigger than our Westren Barges. The principal means by which the people do subsist, are the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>King,</HI> most time held amongst them, and the great resort of <HI>Advodates</HI> and <HI>Clients,</HI> to the <HI>Chambers</HI> of <HI>Parliament:</HI> without these two crutches the Town would get a vile halting, and perhaps be scarce able to stand. What the estates of some of the wealthiest Citizens may amount to, I cannot say: yet I dare conjecture it not to be su∣perfluous. The Author of the Book entitled <HI>Les estats du monde</HI> reckoneth it for a great mer∣vail, that some of our <HI>London Merchants</HI> should be worth 100000. <HI>Crownes</HI>: we account that e∣state amongst us not to be so wonderful; and may hence safely conclude, that they which made a Prodegy of so little, are not much worth themselves.</P>
<P>If you beleeve their apparrel, you may perhaps be perswaded otherwise, that questionless speak∣eth no less than <HI>Millions</HI>; though like it is, that when they are in their best clothes, they are in the <HI>middle of their estate.</HI> But concernig the ridicu∣lous bravery of the poor <HI>Parisian,</HI> take along with you this story. Upon our first coming into <HI>Paris,</HI> there came to visit a <HI>German Lord,</HI> whom we met a Ship-board, a couple of <HI>French Gal∣lants,</HI> his acquaintance: the one of them (for I did not much observe the other) had a suit of <HI>Turkey Grogram</HI> dublet with Taffaty, cut with long slashes and carbonadoes after the <HI>French</HI> fa∣shion, and belayed with bugle lace; through the opening of his dublet appeared his shirt, of the
<PB N="96" REF="51"/>
Purest Holland, and wrought with curious needle-work; the points of his wast and knees all edged with a silver edging, his Garters Roses and Hat∣band sutable to his points; a Beaver hat, and a pare of silk Stokings: his Cloak also of <HI>Turkey Grogram</HI> cut upon black <HI>Taffaty</HI>: This <HI>Lord</HI> (for who would have dared to guesse him other) ap∣plied himself to me, and perceiving my ignorance in the <HI>French,</HI> accosted me in <HI>Latine,</HI> which he spake indifferently well. After some discourse he took notice of mine eyes which were then sore, and Sea sick; and promised me, if I would call on him at his lodging the next morning, to give me a water which suddenly would restore them to their strength and vigor; I humbled thanked his <HI>Lordship,</HI> for such an ineffable and immerited fa∣vour, in the best complement and greatest abai∣sance I could devise. It was not for nought thought I, that our <HI>English</HI> extoll so much, the humanity of this people: Nay I began to accuse report of envy, as not having published the one half of their graces and affabilities. <HI>Quantillum enim virtutum istarum famâ acceperam.</HI> And thus taking my leave of his <HI>Honour,</HI> I greedily expe∣cted the next morning: the morning come, and the hour of visitting his <HI>Lordship</HI> almost at hand, I sent a Servant to fetch a <HI>Barbar</HI> to combe me, and make me neat, as not knowing what occasi∣on I might have of seeing his <HI>Lady,</HI> or his Daugh∣ters: upon the return of the messenger, present∣ly followed <HI>His Altitude,</HI> and bidding me sit down in the chair, he disburdened one of his po∣ckets, <HI>(quis hoc credat nisi sit proteste vetustas)</HI> of
<PB N="97" REF="51"/>
a case of instruments, and the other of a bundle of linnen. Thus accomodated he falleth to work about me, to the earning of <HI>a quart descu:</HI> in my life I had never more ado to hold in my laugh∣ter: and certainly had not an anger or vexation at mine own folly, in casting away so much humble rhetorick the night before upon him, somewhat troubled me, I should either have laught him out of his fine suit, or have broke my heart in the re∣straint, <HI>Quid Domini facient, audent cum talia fures.</HI> If a <HI>Barber</HI> may thus be taken in suspicion for a <HI>Lord</HI>: no doubt but a <HI>Mercer</HI> may be accu∣sed for a <HI>Marquesse.</HI></P>

<PB N="98" REF="52"/>
<HI>Duerus North. Citerioram,</HI> lying from <HI>Tagus,</HI> south; and <HI>Interamnem,</HI> scituate betwixt both the Rivers. <HI>Paris</HI> is seated just as that Province, and may in a manner admit the same division; for the River of <HI>Seine,</HI> doth there disperse it self, that it hath divided the <HI>French Metropolis</HI> into three parts also, <HI>viz. Citeriorem</HI> lying on this side the River which they call <HI>la Ville, the Towne; Ʋlte∣riorem,</HI> lying beyond the further branch of it, which they call <HI>l' université</HI>; and <HI>Interamnem</HI> sci∣tuate between both the streames, in a little Island which they call <HI>la Ceté.</HI> To these adde the <HI>Sub∣urbs,</HI> or (as they call them) the <HI>Faulx Bourgs</HI>: and you have in all four parts of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Faulx bourgs</HI> are not incorporated into the Town, or joyned together with it, as the <HI>Suburbs</HI> of <HI>London</HI> are unto that <HI>Citie:</HI> they stand severed from it a pretty distance, and appear what indeed they are, a distinct body from it. For the most part the houses in them are old and ruinous; yet the <HI>Faulx bourg</HI> of <HI>St. Jacques</HI> is in pretty good fashion, and the least unsightly of them all except <HI>St. Germain</HI>: The <HI>Faulx bourg</HI> of <HI>St. Martin</HI> al∣so hath somewhat to commend it, which is, that the great <HI>Pest house</HI> built by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, is within the precincts of it. A House built qua∣drangular-wise, very large and capacious; and seemeth to such as stand afarre off it (for it is not safe venturing nigh it or within it) to be more like the <HI>Pallace of a King,</HI> then the <HI>Kings Pallace</HI> it self. But the <HI>principallest</HI> of all the <HI>Suburbs</HI> is that of <HI>St. Germain,</HI> a place lately repared, full of divers stately houses, and in bigness little inferi∣our
<PB N="99" REF="52"/>
to <HI>Oxford.</HI> It took name from the <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>St. Germain,</HI> seated in it, built by <HI>Childebert</HI> the son of <HI>Clovis, Anno</HI> 542. in the honour of <HI>St. Vincint.</HI> Afterward it got the name of <HI>St. Ger∣main,</HI> a <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> whose body was there buried, and at whose instigation it had formerly been founded. The number of the <HI>Monkes</HI> was enlarged to the number of 120. by <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>bald,</HI> (he began his raigne <HI>Anno</HI> 841.) and so they continue till this day. The present <HI>Abbot</HI> is <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon, Bishop</HI> of <HI>Metz,</HI> base son unto <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth: He is by his place <HI>Lord</HI> of all the goodly Suburbs, hath the power of levying taxes upon his Tennants, and to him accrew all the profits of the <HI>great fayre</HI> holden here every <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>The principall house in it, is that of the <HI>Queen Mother,</HI> not yet fully built; the <HI>Gallery</HI> of it, which possesseth all the right side of the square, is perfectly finished, and said to be a most royall and majestical piece: the further part also opposite to the gate is finished, so farre forth as concern∣ing the outside and strength of it: the ornamen∣tall part and trapping of it, being not yet added: when it is absolutely consummate, if it hold pro∣portion with the two other sides both within and without, it will be a <HI>Pallace</HI> for the elegancy and politeness of the fabrick, not fellowed in <HI>Europe.</HI> A <HI>Pallace</HI> answerable to the greatness of her mind that built it; yet it is by divers conjectured, that her purpose is never to reside there; for which cause the building goeth slowly forward: for when upon the death of her great <HI>Privado,</HI> the
<PB N="100" REF="53"/>
<HI>Marquiss d' Ancre</HI> (on whom she bestowed much of her grace and favour) she was removed to <HI>Blois,</HI> those of the opposite <HI>faction</HI> in the <HI>Court,</HI> get so strongly into the favour of the <HI>King,</HI> that not without great struggling of those of her party, and the hazard of two Civil Warres, she obtain∣ed her former neerness to his <HI>Majesty.</HI> She can see by this what to trust to, should her absence leave the <HI>Kings</HI> mind any way prepared for new impressions. Likely therefore it is, that she will rather choose to leave her fine house unhabited (further than on occasions for a Banquet) then give the least opportunity to stagger her greatness. This house is called <HI>Luxembourg Pallace,</HI> as being built in a place of an old house, belonging to the <HI>Dukes</HI> of that <HI>Province.</HI> The second house of note in this Suburb, is that of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Condé,</HI> to whom it was given by the <HI>Queene Mo∣ther,</HI> in the first year of her <HI>Regency.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> is that part of it which lyeth on this side of the hithermost branch of the <HI>Seine</HI> towards <HI>Picardie</HI>: what was spoken before in the general, hath its reference to this particular, whe∣ther it concernes the sweetness of the streets, the manner of the building, the furniture of the Ar∣tificer, or the like. It conteineth in it thirteen <HI>Parish Churches,</HI> viz. 1. <HI>St. Germainde l' Auxerre</HI> 2. <HI>St. Eustace.</HI> 3. <HI>les St. Innocents.</HI> 4. <HI>St. Sau∣veur.</HI> 5. <HI>St. Nicholas des Champs.</HI> 6. <HI>le Sepulchre.</HI> 7. <HI>St. Jacques de la boucherie.</HI> 8. <HI>St. Josse.</HI> 9. <HI>St. Mercy.</HI> 10· <HI>St. Jean,</HI> 11. <HI>St. Gervase et St. Pro∣tasse.</HI> 12. <HI>St. Paul.</HI> 13. <HI>St. Jean de ronde.</HI> It hath also in it seven Gates, sc. 1. <HI>St. Anthony</HI> up∣on

<P>The <HI>principall Governour</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> as also of the whole <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> is the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Mont-ba∣zon,</HI> who hath held the office ever since the year, 1619. when it was surrendred by <HI>Luines,</HI> but he little medleth with the City. The particular Go∣vernours of it are the two <HI>Provosts,</HI> the one cal∣led <HI>le Provost de Paris,</HI> the other <HI>le Provost des Merchands</HI>: The <HI>Provost</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> determineth all causes between Citizen and Citizen, whether they be crimical or civil: the office is for term of life: the place of judgement the <HI>Grand Castellet.</HI> The present <HI>Provost</HI> is called <HI>Mr. Sequse,</HI> and is by birth of the <HI>Nobilitie</HI>; as all which are honour∣ed with this office must be: He hath as his Assi∣stants three <HI>Leiutenants:</HI> the <HI>Leiutenant Criminal,</HI> which judgeth in matters of life and death: the <HI>Leiutenant Civil,</HI> which desideth causes of debt or trespasse between party and party: and the <HI>Leiutenant perticulier,</HI> who supplyeth their seve∣ral places in their absence. There are also neces∣sarily required to this Court, the <HI>Procareur</HI> and the <HI>Advocate,</HI> or the <HI>Kings Solicitor</HI> and <HI>Atturney</HI>: twelve <HI>Counsellers,</HI> and of under Officers more than enough. This Office is said to have been erect∣ed in the time of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Son of <HI>Charles</HI> the great. In matters criminal there is an <HI>Appeale</HI> admitted from hence to the <HI>Attornelle.</HI> In matters <HI>Civil,</HI> if
<PB N="102" REF="54"/>
the summe exceed the value of 250. <HI>Liures</HI> to the great Chamber, or <HI>le grand Chambre</HI> in the Court of <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Provost</HI> of the <HI>Merchands</HI> and his authori∣ty was first instituted by <HI>Philip Augustus,</HI> who began his raigne <HI>Anno</HI> 1290. His office is to con∣serve the liberties and indulgences granted to the <HI>Merchants,</HI> and <HI>Artificers</HI> of the <HI>Citie,</HI> to have an eye over the sales of <HI>Wine, Corn, Wood, Coal,</HI> &amp;c. and to impose Taxes on them: to keep the keyes of the Gates, to give the watch word in time of warre: to grant <HI>Passports</HI> to such as are willing to leave the Town▪ and the like. There are also four other Officers joyned unto him; <HI>Es∣chevins</HI> they call them, who also carry a great sway in the <HI>Citie.</HI> There are moreover <HI>Assistants</HI> to them in their proceedings; yea the <HI>Kings Solici∣tor,</HI> (or <HI>Procureur</HI>) and twenty four <HI>Counsellers.</HI> To compare this <HI>Corporation</HI> with that of <HI>London</HI>: the <HI>Provost</HI> is as the <HI>Mayor</HI>: the <HI>Eschevins</HI> as the <HI>Sheriffs</HI>: the twenty four <HI>Counsellers,</HI> as the <HI>Al∣dermen</HI>: and the <HI>Procureur</HI> as the <HI>Recorder.</HI> I o∣mit the under Officers whereof here there is no scarcity. The place of their meeting is called <HI>l' hostelle de ville,</HI> or the <HI>Guild Hall.</HI> The present <HI>Provost, Mr de Gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ux</HI>; his habit as also that of the <HI>Eschevins</HI> and <HI>Counsellers,</HI> half red, half sky coloured, the <HI>Citie</HI> Leveries with an Hood of the same.</P>
<P>This <HI>Provost</HI> is as much above the other in po∣wer, as men which are loved commonly are above those which are feared. This <HI>Provost</HI> the people willingly, yea sometimes factiously obey; as the
<PB N="103" REF="54"/>
<HI>Conservator</HI> of their Liberties: the other they on∣ly dread as the <HI>Judges</HI> of their lives; and the Ty∣rants of their estates. To shew the power of this <HI>Provost</HI> both for and with the people against their <HI>Princes,</HI> you may please to take notice of two in∣stances, for the people, against <HI>Philip devalois Anno</HI> 1349. when the said <HI>King</HI> desiring an im∣post of one <HI>liure</HI> in five <HI>Crownes,</HI> upon all wares sold in <HI>Paris,</HI> (for his better managing his warres against the <HI>English</HI>) could obtain it but for one year onely; and that not without especial Letters reservall, that it should no way incommodate their priviledges: which the people <HI>Anno</HI> 1357. when <HI>King John</HI> was prisoner in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Daulphine,</HI> afterwards the fifth of that name, laboured his ransome among the <HI>Parisiens,</HI> for then <HI>Steven Marcell</HI> attended by the vulgar <HI>Citizens,</HI> not onely brake open the <HI>Daulphin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Chamber, but slew <HI>John de Confluns,</HI> and <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Chermont,</HI> two <HI>Marshalls</HI> of <HI>France</HI> before his face. Nay to adde yet further insolencies to this, he took his parti-coloured hood off his head, put∣ting it on the <HI>Daulphins,</HI> and all that day wore the <HI>Daulphines</HI> hat being a brown black, <HI>pour sig∣nal de sa Dictateur,</HI> as the token of his <HI>Dictator∣ship.</HI> And which is more than all this, he sent the <HI>Daulphin</HI> cloath to make him a Cloak and Hood of the <HI>Cities Liverie</HI>; and compelled him to avow the <HI>Massacre</HI> of his Servants above named, as done by his command: Horrible insolencies! <HI>Quam miserum est eum haec impunè pacere potuisse,</HI> as <HI>Tullie of Marc. Antonius.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="55"/>The Arms of the Town, as also of the Corpora∣tion of the <HI>Provost</HI> and <HI>Eschevins</HI> are <HI>Gules,</HI> a Ship Argent, a Cheife poudred with <HI>Flower de Luces Or.</HI> The seat or place of their Assemblies is called (as we said▪) <HI>Hostel de Ville</HI> or the <HI>Guild-hall.</HI> It was built or rather finisht by <HI>Francis</HI> the first, <HI>Anno</HI> 1533. and since beautified and repaired by <HI>Fran∣cis Miron</HI> once <HI>Provost des Merchands,</HI> and after∣wards privy <HI>Counsellor</HI> to the King. It standeth on one side of the <HI>Greue,</HI> which is the publike place of the Execution, and is built quadrangular-wise, all of free and polished stone, evenly and orderly laid-together. You ascend by thirty or forty steps fair and large, before you come to the quadrate, and thence by several stairs into the several rooms and chambers of it, which are very neatly contri∣ved and richly furnished. The grand <HI>Chastelet</HI> is said to have been built by <HI>Julian</HI> the <HI>Apostata,</HI> at such time as he was Governour of <HI>Gaul.</HI> It was afterwards new built by <HI>Philip Augustus,</HI> and since repaired by <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth. In which time of repaitation the <HI>Provost</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> kept his Court in the Palace of the <HI>Louure.</HI> To sight it is not very graceful, what it may be within I know not. Cer∣tain it is, that it looketh far more like a <HI>Prison</HI> (for which use it also serveth) than a Town Hall or seat of judgement.</P>
<P>In this part of <HI>Paris,</HI> called <HI>la Ville</HI> or the <HI>Town,</HI> is the <HI>Kings Arcenal or Magazin</HI> of War. It carrieth not any great face of majesty on the out∣side; neither indeed is it necessary: Such places are most beautiful without when they are most ter∣rible within. It was begun by <HI>Henry</HI> the second,
<PB N="105" REF="55"/>
finished by <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, and since augmented by Mr. <HI>Rhosme</HI> great <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Artillery.</HI> It is said to contain an hundred field peices and their Carriage; and also armour sufficient for ten thou∣sand Horses, and fifty thousand Foot. In this part also of <HI>Paris</HI> is that excellent pile of building, cal∣led the <HI>Place Royal,</HI> built partly at the charges, and partly at the encouragement of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth. It is built after the form of a <HI>Quadrangle,</HI> every side of the square being in length seventy two fa∣thoms; the materials brick of divers colours, which make it very pleasant, though less durable. It is cloystered round just after the fashion of the <HI>Roy∣all Exchange</HI> in <HI>London</HI>; the walks being paved under foot. The houses of it are very fair and large, every one having its garden and other out∣lets. In all they are thirty six, nine on a side, and seemed to be sufficiently capable of a great reti∣nue. The <HI>Ambassadour</HI> for the <HI>State of Venice</HI> ly∣ing in one of them. It is scituate in that place, whereas formerly the solemn tiltings were per∣formed. A place famous and fatal for the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, who was here slain with the splinter of a Launce, as he was running with the <HI>Earl of Mountgomery, a Scottish</HI> man. A sad and heavy accident.</P>
<P>To conclude this discourse of the <HI>Ville</HI> or <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> I must wander a little out of it; because the power and command of the provost saith that it must be so: For his authority is not confined within the Town, he hath seven Daughters on which he may exercise it, <HI>Les sept filles de la Pro∣paste de Paris,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call them. These
<PB N="106" REF="56"/>
seven Daughters are seven Bayliwicks comprehen∣ded within the <HI>Vicointe of Paris</HI>: Viz. 1. <HI>Poissy.</HI> 2. <HI>St. Germanenlay.</HI> 3. <HI>Tornon.</HI> 4. <HI>Teroiene Brie.</HI> 5. <HI>Corbeil.</HI> 6. <HI>Moutherrie</HI>: and the 7. <HI>Gennesseen France.</HI> Over these his jurisdiction is extended, though not as <HI>Provost</HI> of <HI>Paris.</HI> Here he commandeth and giveth judgement as <HI>Leiute∣nant Civil</HI> to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Mont-bâzon,</HI> or the su∣preme Governour of <HI>Paris</HI> and the Isle of <HI>France</HI> for the time being; yet this Leiutenancy being an Office perpetually annexed to the <HI>Provostship,</HI> is the occasion that the Bayliwicks above named are called, <HI>Les sept filles de la Provaste.</HI></P>

the erecting of convenient places of study: so that in process of time <HI>Paris</HI> became enriched with fifty two <HI>Colledges:</HI> so many it still hath, though the odd fourty are little serviceable to <HI>Learning</HI>: For in twelve onely of them is there any publike reading, either in <HI>Divinity</HI> or <HI>Philosophy.</HI> These twelve are the <HI>Colledges</HI> of 1. <HI>Harcourte.</HI> 2. <HI>Caillve,</HI> or the <HI>petit Sorbonne.</HI> 3. <HI>Liseuer,</HI> or <HI>Ce∣rovium.</HI> 4. <HI>Boncorrte.</HI> 5. <HI>Montague.</HI> 6. <HI>Les Marche.</HI> 7. <HI>Navarre.</HI> 8. <HI>De le Cardinal de Noyne.</HI> 9. <HI>Le Plessis.</HI> 10. <HI>De Beavis.</HI> 11. <HI>La Sorbonne.</HI> 12. <HI>De Clermont,</HI> or the <HI>Colledge</HI> of the <HI>Jesuits.</HI> There are also publike readings in the houses of the four Orders of <HI>Mendicant Fri∣ers: Viz.</HI> the <HI>Carmelites, the Augustines, the Franciscans,</HI> or <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> and the <HI>Dominicans.</HI> The other <HI>Colledges</HI> are destinate to other uses: That of <HI>Arras</HI> is converted to an house of <HI>English Fu∣gitives</HI>: and there is another of them hard by the gate of <HI>Jacques</HI> employed for the reception of the <HI>Irish</HI>: in others of them there is Lodging al∣lotted out to <HI>Students,</HI> who for ther instruction have resort to some of the twelve <HI>Colledges</HI> above mentioned.</P>
<P>In each of these <HI>Colledges</HI> there is a <HI>Rector,</HI> most of whose places yeild them but small profit. The greatest commodity which accreweth to them is raised from Chamber-rents: their Preferments be∣ing much of a nature with that of a <HI>Principal</HI> of an <HI>Hall in Oxford:</HI> or that of a <HI>Treasurer</HI> in an <HI>Inne of Chancery</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> At the first erection of their <HI>Colledges</HI> they were all prohibited marriage, though I see little reason for it: There can hardly come
<PB N="110" REF="58"/>
any inconvenience or damage by it unto the <HI>Scho∣lars</HI> under their charge, by assuming of leases into their own hands, for I think few of them have any to be so embezelled<HI>: Anno</HI> 1520. or thereabouts, it was permitted to such of them as were <HI>Doctors</HI> in <HI>Physick</HI>; that they might marry; the <HI>Cardinal</HI> of <HI>Toute-ville, Legate in France</HI> giving to them that indulgence. Afterwards in the year 1534. the <HI>Doctors</HI> of the <HI>Laws</HI> petitioned the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> for the like priviledge, which in fine was granted to them: and confirmed by the <HI>Court of Parliament.</HI> The <HI>Doctors of Divinity</HI> are the onely <HI>Academicals</HI> now barred from it, and that not as <HI>Rectors</HI> but as <HI>Preists.</HI> These <HI>Colledges</HI> for their building are very inelegant and generally little beholding to the cu∣riosity of the Artificer. So confused and so ill proportioned in respect of our <HI>Colledges in Eng∣land</HI>; as <HI>Exeter in Oxford</HI> was some twelve years since in comparison of the rest; or as the two <HI>Temples in London</HI> now are in reference to <HI>Lin∣colns Inne.</HI> The Revenues of them are sutable to the <HI>Fabricks,</HI> as mean and curtailed: I could not learn of any <HI>Colledge</HI> that hath greater allowances than that of the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> and how small a trifle that is, we shall tell you presently. But this is not the poverty of the <HI>Ʋniversity of Paris</HI> onely, all <HI>France</HI> is troubled with the same want of encou∣ragements in learning: Neither are the <HI>Academies of Germany</HI> in any happier estate; which occasio∣ned <HI>Erasmus</HI> that great light of his times, having been here in <HI>England,</HI> and seen <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to write thus to one of his <HI>Dutch</HI> acquaintance<HI>: Ʋnum Collegium Cantabrigiense (confidenter dicam) su∣perat

vel decem nostra.</HI> It holdeth good in the neat∣ness and graces of the buildings, in which sense he spake it, but it had been more undeniable had he intended it of the <HI>Revenues.</HI> Yet I was given to understand, that at <HI>Tholoza</HI> there was amongst twenty <HI>Colledges</HI> one of an especial quality, and so indeed it is if rightly considered. There are said to be in it twenty <HI>Students</HI> places (or <HI>Fellowships</HI> as we call them) The <HI>Students</HI> at their entrance are to lay down in <HI>deposito</HI> six thousand F<HI>lorens</HI> or <HI>Liures,</HI> to stay there onely six years; in the mean time to enjoy the profits of the House, &amp; at the 6, years end to have his 6000. <HI>Liures</HI> paid unto him by Successor: <HI>Vendere jure potest, emerat ille prius.</HI> A pretty Market.</P>
<P>The <HI>Colledge</HI> of <HI>Sorbonni</HI> (which indeed is the glory of this <HI>Ʋniversity</HI>) Was built by one <HI>Robert de Sorbonne</HI> of the Chamber to <HI>Lewit</HI> the ninth, of whom he was very well beloved. It consisteth meerly of <HI>Doctors of Divinity</HI>: neither can any of another profession, nor any of the same profession, not so graduated, be admitted unto it. At this time their number is about seventy, their allowance a pint of Wine (their pint being but a thought less than our quart) and a certain quantity of bread daily. Meat they have none allowed them, unless they pay for it; but they pay not so much: for five <HI>Sols</HI> (which amounteth to six pence <HI>English</HI>) a day they challenge a competency of flesh or fish to be served to them at their Chambers. These <HI>Doctors</HI> have the sole power &amp; authority in conferring de∣grees in <HI>Divinity:</HI> The <HI>Rector</HI> and other Officers in the University having nothing to do in it. To them
<PB N="112" REF="59"/>
alone belongeth the examination of the <HI>Students</HI> in that faculty: the approbation and bestowing of the honours: and to their <HI>Lectures</HI> do all such assiduously repair as are that way minded. All of them in their turns discharge this office of reading and that by six in a day, three of them making good the Pulpit in the forenoon, and as many in the af∣ternoon. These <HI>Doctors</HI> also are accounted toge∣ther with the <HI>Parliament of Paris,</HI> the principal pil∣lars of the <HI>French</HI> liberty; whereof indeed they are exceeding jealous, as well in matters <HI>Ecclesiasti∣cal</HI> as <HI>Civil.</HI> When <HI>Gerson Chancellor of Paris</HI> (he died <HI>Anno</HI> 1429.) had published a book in appro∣bation of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Constance,</HI> where it was enacted, that the authority of the <HI>Council</HI> was greater than that of the <HI>Pope</HI>; the <HI>Sorbonne Doctors</HI> declared that also to be their doctrine. Afterwards when <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh, to gratifie <HI>Pope Pius</HI> the second, purposed to abolish the force of the <HI>Prag∣matick Sanction,</HI> the <HI>Sorbonnists</HI> in the behalf of the Church <HI>Gallican</HI> and the <HI>Ʋniversity of Paris mag∣nis obsistebant animis</HI> (saith <HI>Sleidan</HI> in his Com∣mentary) <HI>&amp; a papâ provacabant ad Concilium.</HI> The <HI>Council</HI> unto which they appealed was that of <HI>Ba∣sil,</HI> where that <HI>Sanction</HI> was made: So that by this appeal they verified their former <HI>Thesis,</HI> that the <HI>Council</HI> was above the <HI>Pope.</HI> And not long since, <HI>Anno, viz.</HI> 1613. casually meeting with a Book written by <HI>Becanus</HI> entituled, <HI>Controversia Angli∣cana de potestate Regis &amp; Papae,</HI> they called an As∣sembly and condemned it. For though the Main of it were against the power and supremacy of the <HI>King of England,</HI> yet did it reflect also on the au∣thority
<PB N="113" REF="59"/>
of the <HI>Pope</HI> over the <HI>Christian Kings</HI> by the by; which occasioned the sentence. So jealous are they of the least circumstances, in which the immunity of their Nation may be endan∣gered.</P>
<P>As for the government of the <HI>Ʋniversity,</HI> it hath for its cheif <HI>Director,</HI> a <HI>Rector,</HI> with a <HI>Chancellor,</HI> four <HI>Procurators</HI> or <HI>Proctors,</HI> and as many others whom they call his <HI>Intrantes</HI> to assist him; besides the <HI>Regents.</HI> Of these the <HI>Regents</HI> are such <HI>Masters</HI> of the <HI>Arts,</HI> who are by the consent of the rest selected to read the publike <HI>Lectures</HI> of <HI>Logick</HI> and <HI>Philosophy.</HI> Their name they derive <HI>a regendo, eo quod in artibus rexerint.</HI> These are divided into four Nations: <HI>Viz.</HI> 1. The <HI>Norman.</HI> 2. The <HI>Picard.</HI> 3. The <HI>Germain.</HI> 4. The <HI>French.</HI> Un∣der the two first are comprehended the <HI>Students</HI> of those several <HI>Provinces</HI>; under the third the <HI>Stu∣dents</HI> of all <HI>Forrain Nations,</HI> which repair hither for the attainment of knowledge. It was heretofore called <HI>Natio Anglica</HI>: but the <HI>English</HI> being thought unworthy of the honour, because of their separation from the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> the name and credit of it was given to the <HI>Germains.</HI> That of the <HI>French</HI> is again subdivided into two parts; that which is immediately within the <HI>Diocess</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the rest of <HI>Gallia</HI>: these four Nations (for notwithstanding the subdivision above mentioned, the <HI>French Nation</HI> is reckoned but as one) choose yearly four <HI>Proctors</HI> or <HI>Procurators,</HI> so called, <HI>Quia negotia nationis suae procurant.</HI> They choose also four other <HI>Officers,</HI> whom they call <HI>les Intrants,</HI> in whose power there remaineth the delegated au∣thority
<PB N="114" REF="60"/>
of their several <HI>Nations.</HI> And here it is to be observed, that in the French Nation the Procu∣rator and Intrant is one year of the <HI>Diocess of Pa∣ris,</HI> and the following year of the rest of <HI>France,</HI> the reason why that <HI>Nation</HI> is subdivided: These four <HI>Intrants</HI> thus named have amongst them the election of their <HI>Rector,</HI> who is their supreme <HI>Ma∣gistrate.</HI></P>
<P>The present <HI>Rector</HI> is Mr. <HI>Tarrisnus</HI> of the <HI>Col∣ledge of Harcourte,</HI> a Master of the <HI>Arts,</HI> for a <HI>Doctor</HI> is not capable of the office. The honour lasteth onely three moneths; which time expired, the <HI>Intrants</HI> proceed to a new election; though oftentimes it happeneth, that the same hath the lease of his authority renewed. Within the con∣fines of the University he taketh place next after the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Bloud:</HI> and at the publike ex∣ercises of <HI>Learning</HI> before the <HI>Cardinals</HI>; other∣wise he giveth them the precedency. But to <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> and <HI>Arch-bishops</HI> he will not grant it upon any occasion. It was not two moneths before my being there, that there happened a shrewd contro∣versie about it. The <HI>King</HI> had then summoned an assembly of twenty five <HI>Bishops</HI> of the <HI>Provinces</HI> adjoyning, to consult about some <HI>Church</HI> affairs; and they had chosen the <HI>Colledge</HI> of <HI>Sorbonne</HI> to be their <HI>Senate-House</HI>: When the first day of their sitting came, a <HI>Doctor</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> being appoint∣ed to preach before them, began his <HI>Oration</HI> with <HI>Reverendissime Rector &amp; vos Amplissimi Praesulei.</HI> Here the <HI>Arch-bishop</HI> of <HI>Roven,</HI> a man of an high spirit interrupted him, and commanded him to invert his stile. He obeyed, and presently the <HI>Re∣ctor</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="60"/>
riseth up with <HI>Impono tibi silentium,</HI> which is an <HI>Injunction</HI> within the compass of his power. Upon this, the <HI>Preacher</HI> being tongue-tied, the contro∣versie grew hot between the <HI>Bishops</HI> and the <HI>Rector,</HI> both parties very eagerly pleading their own pri∣ority. All the morning being almost spent in this altercation; a <HI>Cardinal</HI> wiser than the rest, desi∣red that their question for that time might be laid aside, and that the <HI>Rector</HI> would be pleased to per∣mit the <HI>Doctor</HI> to deliver his Sermon, beginning it without any <HI>Praeludium</HI> at all. To which request the <HI>Rector</HI> yeilded; and so the contention at that time was ended.</P>
<P>But <HI>Salus Academiae non vertitur in istis.</HI> It were more for honour and profit of the <HI>Ʋniversity,</HI> if the <HI>Rector</HI> would leave of to be so mindful of his place, and look a little to his office; for certainly the eye and utmost diligence of a <HI>Magistrate</HI> was never wanting more; and yet more necessary in this place. <HI>Penelopes suiters</HI> never behaved them∣selves so insolently in the house of <HI>Ʋlisses,</HI> as the <HI>Academicks</HI> here do in the houses and streets of <HI>Paris.</HI>

ravish him into Gaole; I have not heard that they can be hired to a murder, though nothing be more common amongst them than killing, except it be stealing. Witness those many Carcasses which are found dead in a morning, whom a desire to secur themselves, and make resistance to their pillages, hath (onely) made earth again. Nay, which is most horrible, they have regulated their villanous practises into a <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> and have their <HI>Captains</HI> and other Officers, who command them in their night walks and dispose of their purcha∣ses. To be a <HI>Gypsie,</HI> and a <HI>Scholar</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> are al∣most <HI>Synonime's.</HI> One of their <HI>Captains</HI> had in one week (for no longer would the gallows let him enjoy his honour) stoln no fewer than eighty Cloaks: <HI>Nam fuit Autolei tam piceata manus?</HI> For these thefts being apprehended, he was adjudged to the wheel; but because the <HI>Judges</HI> were informed. that during the time of his raign he had kept the hands of himself and his company unpolluted with bloud, he had the favour to be hanged. In a word, this ungoverned rabble (whom to call <HI>Scho∣lars</HI> were to prophane the title) omit no outrages or turbulent misdemeanours which possibly can be, or were ever known to be committed in a place, which consisteth meerly of priviledge and no∣thing of statute.</P>
<P>I could heartily wish, that those, who are so ill conceited of their own two <HI>Ʋniversities, Oxford and Cambridge,</HI> and accuse them of dissolutions in their behaviour, would either spend some time in the <HI>Schools</HI> beyond Seas, or enquire what news abroad of those which have seen them; then would

they doubtless see their own errors and correct them; then would they admire the regularity and civility of those places, which before they condem∣ned of debauchedness: then would they esteem those places as the seminaries of modesty and ver∣tue, which they now account as the nurseries onely of an impudent rudeness. Such an opinion I am sure, some of the <HI>Aristarchi</HI> of these dayes have lodged in their breasts concerning the misgovern∣ing of our <HI>Athens.</HI> Perhaps a Kinsman of theirs hath played the unthrift equally of his time and his money: Hence their malice to it, and their inve∣ctives against it. Thus of old.

An injustice more unpardonable than the greatest sin of the <HI>Ʋniversities.</HI> But I wrong a good cause with an unnecessary patronage, yet such is the pec∣cant humour of some, that they know not how to expiate the follies of some one, but with the ca∣lumny and dispraise of all. An unmanly weakness, and yet many possessed with it. I know it is im∣possible, that in a place of youth and liberty, some should not give occasion of offence. The <HI>Ark,</HI> wherein there were eight persons onely, was not without one <HI>Canaan</HI>: And of the twelve which <HI>Christ</HI> had chosen one was a <HI>Devil.</HI> It were then above a miracle, if amongst so full a Cohort of young Souldiers none should forsake the <HI>Ensign</HI> of his <HI>General</HI>: He notwithstanding that should give

the imputation of cowardise to the whole Army, cannot but be accounted malitious or peevish. But let all such as have evil will at <HI>Sion</HI> live unregarded, and die unremembred for want of some <HI>Sciolar</HI> to write their <HI>Epitaph.</HI> Certainly a man not wedded to envy and a spiteful vexation of spirit, upon a due examination of our <HI>Lycaea,</HI> and a Comparison of them abroad with those abroad, cannot but say, and that justly, <HI>Non habent Academiae Anglicanae pares, nisi seipsas.</HI></P>
<P>The principal cause of the rudeness and disor∣ders in <HI>Paris</HI> had been cheifly occasioned by the great priviledges where with the <HI>Kings of France</HI> intended the furtherance and security of <HI>Learn∣ing.</HI> Having thus let them get the bridle in their own hands, no marvel if they grow sick with an uncontrouled licentiousness. Of these privi∣ledges some are, that no <HI>Scholars</HI> goods can be sei∣zed upon for the payments of his debts: that none of them should be liable to any taxes or impositi∣ons: (a <HI>Royal</HI> immunity to such as are acquainted with <HI>France</HI>;) that they might carry and recarry their <HI>utensiles</HI> without the least molestation: that they should have the <HI>Provost of Paris</HI> to be the <HI>Keeper</HI> and <HI>Defender</HI> of their <HI>Liberties,</HI> who is therefore stiled, <HI>Le conservateur despriviledges Royaux de le Ʋniversite de Paris,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>One greater priviledge they have yet than all these; which is their soon taking of degrees. Two years seeth them both novices in the <HI>Arts,</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> of them: so that enjoying by their de∣grees an absolute freedom, before the fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies and violencies of youth are broken in them, they be∣come
<PB N="119" REF="62"/>
so unruly and insolent as I have told you· These degrees are conferred on them by the <HI>Chan∣cellor,</HI> who seldom examineth further of them than hss <HI>Fees.</HI> Those paid, he presenteth them to the <HI>Rector,</HI> and giveth them their <HI>Letters Patents</HI> sealed with the <HI>Ʋniversities</HI> seal, which is the main part of the Creation. He also setteth the Seal to the <HI>Authentical Letters</HI> (for so they term them) of such whom the <HI>Sorbonists</HI> have passed for <HI>Doctors.</HI> The present <HI>Chancellor</HI> is named <HI>Petrus de Piere Vi∣ve, Doctor of Divinity,</HI> and <HI>Chanoin</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Nostre-dame</HI> (as also are all they which enjoy that <HI>Office.</HI>) He is chosen by the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and taketh place of any under that dignity.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> commonly called <HI>Isle de palais</HI> seated between the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> and the Town, is that part of the whole, which is called <HI>la Cite</HI> the <HI>City</HI>: The <HI>Epitome</HI> and abstract of all <HI>France:</HI> It is the sweetest and best ordered part of <HI>Paris</HI>; and certainly if <HI>Paris</HI> may be thought the eye of the <HI>Realm,</HI> this <HI>Island</HI> may equally be judged the <HI>apple</HI> of the eye. It is by much the lesser part, and by as much the richer, by as much the decenter, and affordeth more variety of delightful objects than both the other. It containeth an equal number of parish <HI>Churches</HI> with the <HI>Town,</HI> and double the number with the <HI>Ʋniversity.</HI> For it hath in it thir∣teen <HI>Churches</HI> parochial: <HI>Viz.</HI> 1. <HI>La Magda∣lene.</HI> 2. <HI>St. Geniveue des Ardents.</HI> 3. <HI>St. Chri∣stofer.</HI> 4. <HI>St. Pierre aux boeafs.</HI> 5. <HI>St. Marine.</HI> 6. <HI>St. Landry.</HI> 7. <HI>St. Symphoryan.</HI> 8. <HI>St. Denis de la charite.</HI> 9. <HI>St. Bartellemie.</HI> 10. <HI>St. Pier∣re des Assis.</HI> 11. <HI>St. Croix.</HI> 12. <HI>St. Marcial.</HI> 13. <HI>St. German le Vieux.</HI> Seated it is in the mid∣dle of the <HI>Seine,</HI> and in that place where stood the old <HI>Lutetia.

<PB N="121" REF="63"/>
<HI>bridges,</HI> two of wood and four of stone. The stone <HI>bridges</HI> are, 1. <HI>Le petit pont, a bridge</HI> which certainly deserveth the name. 2. <HI>Le pont de Nostre-Dame,</HI> which is all covered with two goodly ranks of houses, and those adorned with portly and an∣tick imagery. 3. <HI>Le pont St. Michell,</HI> (so called, because it leadeth towards the gate of <HI>St. Michell</HI>) hath also on each side a beautiful row of houses all of the same fashion so exactly, that but by their several doors you could scarce think them to be several houses. They are all new, as being built in the raign of this present King; whose Armes is engraven over every door of them. The fourth and last <HI>bridge</HI> is that which standeth at the end of the <HI>Isle</HI> next the <HI>Louure,</HI> and covereth the waters now united into one stream. It was begun to be built by <HI>Katherine of Medices the Queen Mo∣ther, Anno</HI> 1578. her Son <HI>King Henry</HI> the third laying the first stone of it. The finishing of it was reserved to <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, who as soon as he had settled his affairs in this <HI>Town,</HI> presently sent the workmen about it. In the end of it, where it joyneth to the <HI>Town,</HI> there is a <HI>Water house,</HI> which by artificial engines forceth up waters from a fresh spring rising from under the <HI>River,</HI> done at the charges of the <HI>King</HI> also. In the midst of it is the <HI>Statua</HI> of the said <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth all in brass, mounted upon his barbed Steed of the same mer∣tal. They are both of them very unproportiona∣ble to those bodies which they represent, and would shew them big enough were they placed upon the top of <HI>Nostre-dame Church:</HI> What min∣ded <HI>King Lewis</HI> to make his <HI>Father</HI> of so <HI>Gigantine</HI>

a stature I cannot tell. <HI>Alexander</HI> at his return from his <HI>Indian</HI> expedition scattered armours, swords, and horse-bits far bigger than were serviceable, to make future ages admire his greatness: Yet some have hence collected, that the acts he performed are not so great as is reported, because he strived to make them seem greater than they were. It may also chance to happen, that men in the times to come, comparing the atchievements of this <HI>King</HI> with his brasen portraiture, may think that the <HI>Historians</HI> have as much belyed his valour, as his <HI>Statuary</HI> hath his person.</P>
<P><HI>A ponte ad pontifices.</HI> From the bridge proceed we to the <HI>Church</HI>: the principal <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> being that of <HI>Nostre-dame.</HI> A <HI>Church</HI> very un∣certain of its first <HI>Founder</HI>; though some report him to be <HI>St. Savinian,</HI> of whom I can meet with no more than his name. But whoever laid the first foundation it much matters not, all the glory of the work being now cast on <HI>Philip Augustus,</HI> who pit∣tying the ruines of it, began to build it <HI>Anno</HI> 1196. It is a very fair and awful building, adorned with a very beautiful front, and two towers of especial height. It is in length 174. paces, and sixty in breadth, and is said to be as many paces high, and that the two towers are seventy yards higher than the rest of his <HI>Church.</HI> At your first entrance on the right hand, is the <HI>Effigies</HI> of <HI>St. Christopher</HI> with our <HI>Saviour</HI> on his shoulders: A man the <HI>Le∣gend</HI> maketh him, as well as the <HI>Mason,</HI> of a <HI>Gigan∣tine</HI> stature, though of the two the <HI>Masons</HI> work∣manship is the more admirable; his being cut out all of one <HI>Fair stone,</HI> that of the <HI>Legendary</HI> being

patched up of many fabulous &amp; ridiculous shreeds.

It was a <HI>Bishoprick</HI> onely till the year 1622. when <HI>Pope Gregory</HI> the fifteenth at the re∣quest of <HI>King Lewis</HI> raised it to a <HI>Metropolitanship.</HI> But beside the addition of <HI>Honour,</HI> I think the pre∣sent <HI>Incumbent</HI> hath got nothing either in prece∣dency or profit.

Before he had the priority of all the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and now he is but the last of all the <HI>Arch-bishops.</HI> A preferment almost rather intellectual than real, and perhaps his successors may account it a punish∣ment. For besides that, the dignity is too un∣weildy for the <HI>Revenue,</HI> which is but 600. <HI>liures,</HI> or 600 <HI>li English</HI> yearly; like enough it is, that some may come into that <HI>See</HI> of <HI>Caesars</HI> mind, who be∣ing in a small Village of the <HI>Alpes,</HI> thus delivered his ambition to his followers, <HI>Mallem esse hic pri∣mus, quam Romae secundus.</HI> The present possessour of this <HI>Chair</HI> is one <HI>Francis de Gondi,</HI> by birth a <HI>Florentine,</HI> one whom I have heard much famed for a <HI>Statesman,</HI> but little for a <HI>Scholar.</HI> But had he nothing in him, this one thing were sufficient to make him famous to posterity; that he was the first <HI>Arlh-bishop,</HI> and the last <HI>Bishop</HI> of the City of <HI>Paris.</HI> There is moreover in this <HI>Church</HI> a <HI>Dean,</HI> seven <HI>Dignities</HI> and fifty <HI>Canons.</HI> The <HI>Deans</HI> place is valued at 4000▪ <HI>liuree,</HI> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Dignities</HI> at 3006. and

<P>At <HI>Diepe</HI> (as I have said) I observed the first <HI>Idolatry</HI> of the <HI>Papists</HI>; here I noted their first Su∣perstitions, which were the needless use of <HI>holy Water</HI>; and the burning of Lamps before the <HI>Al∣ter.</HI> The first is said to be the invention of <HI>Pope Alexander,</HI> the seventh <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> in their account after <HI>Peter.</HI> I dare not give so much credit unto <HI>Platina,</HI> as to beleeve it of this Anti∣quity, much less unto <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> who deriveth it from the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves: in this <HI>Paradox</HI> he hath enemies enough at home; his own <HI>Do∣ctors</HI> being all for <HI>Alexander</HI>: yet they also are not in the right. The principall foundation of their opinion is an <HI>Epistle Decretory</HI> of the said <HI>Alexander,</HI> which in it self carries its own con∣futation. The citations of <HI>Scriptures,</HI> on which this Superstition is thought to be grounded, are all taken out of the <HI>Vulgar Translation, Latine,</HI> at∣tributed to <HI>St. Hierome</HI>; whereas neither was there in the time of <HI>Alexander</HI> any publick Translation of the <HI>Bible</HI> into <HI>Latine</HI>; neither was <HI>St. Hie∣rome</HI> born within 300. years after him. <HI>Holy Water</HI> then is not of such a standing in the <HI>Church,</HI> as the <HI>Papists</HI> would perswade us; and as yet I have not met with any, that can justly inform me at what time the <HI>Church</HI> received it. Many cor∣ruptions they have among them, whereof neither they nor we can tell the beginning.</P>
<P>It consisteth of two Ingredients. <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Wa∣ter</HI>; each of them severally consecrated, or ra∣ther exorcized; for so the words go, <HI>Exorcizo te
<PB N="125" REF="65"/>
creatura salis</HI>: and afterwards <HI>Exorcizo te creatu∣ra aquae &amp;c.</HI> This done the Salt is sprinkled into the Water in form of a <HI>Crosse,</HI> the <HI>Priest</HI> in the mean time saying <HI>Commixtio salis et aquae pariter fiat in nomine Patris,</HI> &amp;c. Being made it is put into a <HI>Cisterne</HI> standing at the entrance of their <HI>Churches</HI>: the people at their coming in some∣times dipping their fingers into it, and making with it the sign of the <HI>Crosse</HI> in their foreheads, and sometimes being sprinkled with it by one of the <HI>Priests,</HI> who in course bestow that blessing upon them. <HI>Pope Alexander,</HI> who is said to be the Father of it, gave it the gift of purifying and sanctifying all which it washed: <HI>Ʋt Cunesti il∣la aspersi purificentur et sanctificentur,</HI> saith his <HI>Decretall.</HI> The <HI>Roman Ritual</HI> published and con∣firmed by <HI>Paulus</HI> the fifth, maketh it very sove∣raigne, <HI>ad abigendos Daemones, et Spiritus imun∣dos: Bellarmine</HI> maintaineth it a principall reme∣dy <HI>ad remissionem peccatorum Venialium:</HI> and saith, that this was the perpetual doctrine of the <HI>Church. August. Steuchus</HI> in his <HI>Commentary</HI> upon <HI>Num∣bers,</HI> leaveth out <HI>Venialia,</HI> and pronounceth it to be necessary; <HI>Ʋt ad eius aspersum debita nostra deleantur:</HI> So omnipotent is the <HI>Holy Water,</HI> that the blood of our <HI>Saviour Christ</HI> may be in a manner judged unnecessary. But it is not onely used in the <HI>Churches,</HI> the <HI>Rituale Romanum,</HI> (of which I spake but now) alloweth any of the faithfull to carry it away with them, in their ves∣sels, <HI>ad aspergendos aegros, domos, agros, vineas et alia, et ad habendum eam in cubiculis suis.</HI> To which purposes it cannot but think this <HI>Water</HI> ve∣ry serviceable.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="66"/>The second Superstition which this <HI>Church</HI> shewed me, was the continual burning of a Lamp, before the <HI>Alter</HI>: A Ceremony brought into the <HI>Churches</HI> (as it is likely) by <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> the third, <HI>Anno</HI> 1215. at which time he ordained there should a <HI>Pix</HI> be bought to cover the bread, and that it should therein be reserved over the <HI>Al∣tar.</HI> This honour one of late times hath commu∣nicated also unto the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI>; whose Image in the <HI>Church</HI> hath a <HI>Lanthorne ex diametro</HI> before it; and in that a <HI>Candle</HI> perpetually burning. The name of the <HI>Donor</HI> I could not learn: onely I met on the Screene close by the <HI>Ladies Image</HI> this <HI>Inscription: Vne Ave Mariae et un Pater nostre pour luy qui ce la donne:</HI> which was intended on him that bestowed the <HI>Lanthorne.</HI> No question but <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> when he ordained this <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stall Fire</HI> to be kept amongst the <HI>Christians</HI> thought he had done God good service, in reviving this old <HI>Commandement</HI> given to <HI>Moses</HI> in the twenty seventh of <HI>Exodus</HI> and the twentieth and twenty one verses. If so the World cannot clear him of <HI>Judaisme,</HI> therefore the best way were to say, he learned it of the <HI>Géntiles</HI>; for we read that the <HI>Athenians</HI> had <HI>Lychnum inextineti luminis</HI> before the <HI>Statua</HI> of their <HI>Pallas:</HI> that the <HI>Persians</HI> also had <HI>ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m pervigilem</HI> in their <HI>Temples:</HI> and so also had the <HI>Medians</HI> and <HI>Asirians:</HI> to omit the everlasting Fire of <HI>Vesta,</HI> and come neer home, we meet with it also here in <HI>Britaine. In Brita∣nia quoque</HI> (saith a good <HI>Philosopher) Minervae numen colitur: in cuius Templo perpetui ignes</HI> &amp;c. Afterwards the flattery of the <HI>Court</HI> applying di∣vine
<PB N="127" REF="66"/>
honours unto their <HI>Kings,</HI> this custom of ha∣ving fire continually burning before them, began to grow in fashion among the <HI>Romans: Herodian</HI> amongst other the ensigns of <HI>Imperial Majesty</HI> is sure not to omit this: and therefore telleth us, that notwithanding <HI>Commodus</HI> was fallen out with his sister <HI>Lucilla,</HI> he permitted her her antient seat in the <HI>Theater,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and that fire should be carried before her. The present <HI>Romans</HI> succeed the former as in their possessions so in their follies. For calling the <HI>Sacrament</HI> their <HI>Lord God,</HI> and the <HI>Virgin</HI> their <HI>Lady</HI>; they thought they should rob them of half their honour, should they not have their lamps and fires also burning before them.</P>
<P>As are their <HI>Lamps,</HI> so is their <HI>Holy water,</HI> meer∣ly heathenish, <HI>Siquidem in omnibus Sacris</HI> (as we read in the fourth book <HI>Genialium Dierum</HI>) <HI>Sacer∣dos cum Diis immolat &amp; rem divinan facit, corporis ablutione purgatur.</HI> The Author giveth a reason for it, and I would no <HI>Papist,</HI> no not <HI>Bellarmine</HI> himself to give a better. <HI>Aquae enim aspersione la∣bemtolli, &amp; castimoniam praestare putant.</HI> Neither did the <HI>Preist</HI> onely use it himself, but he sprinkled the people also with it.

In which place two things are to be noted: First, <HI>ramus Olivae,</HI> now called <HI>Aspersorium,</HI> or the sprin∣kling rod, wherewith the water is sprinkled on the
<PB N="128" REF="67"/>
standers by: and secondly, the term <HI>Lustrare</HI> meer∣ly <HI>heathenish,</HI> whence the <HI>Holy water</HI> of the <HI>Papists</HI> (no question) had the name of <HI>Aqua lustralis,</HI> by which they call it. That the <HI>Laicks</HI> also of the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> were cleansed of sin by this water, is evident by that of <HI>Homer,</HI> where he maketh <HI>Orestes,</HI> having killed his Mother and threupon grown mad, at once restored to his wits by washing in the water. Perhaps <HI>Pilate</HI> might allude to this custom, when having condemned our <HI>Saviour,</HI> he washed his hands in the midst of the <HI>Congregation.</HI> Hereunto also <HI>Ovid.</HI>
<Q><LG>
<L>O faciles nimium, qui tristia crimina caedis</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too facil souls, which think such hainous matters</L>
<L>Can be abolish'd by the River-Waters.</L>
</LG></Q>
Indeed in the word <HI>Fluminae â</HI> the <HI>Poet</HI> was some∣what out, the waters onely of the Sea serving for the expiation of any crime; the reason was, <HI>cum propter vim igneam magnopere purgationibus consen∣taneae putaretur.</HI> And for this cause questionless do the <HI>popish Priest</HI> use salt in the consecration of their <HI>holy water,</HI> that it might as near as was possi∣ble resemble the waters of the Sea in saltness, so willing are they in all circumstances to act the Heathens.</P>
<P>But I have kept you too long within the <HI>Church,</HI> it is now time to go up to the top, and survey the out-works of it. It hath (as we have already said) at the front two <HI>Towers</HI> of admirable beauty,
<PB N="129" REF="67"/>
they are both of an equal height, and are each of them 377. steps in the ascent. From thence we could clearly see the whole circuit of <HI>Paris,</HI> and each several street of it, such as we have already described, of an orbicular form, and neatly com∣pacted. From hence we could see the whole val∣ley round about it, such as I have delineated alrea∣dy though not in such lively colours as it meriteth. An object it is so delicious and ravishing, that had the <HI>Devil</HI> taken <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth and placed him on the top of this <HI>Temple,</HI> as he did our <HI>Savi∣our</HI> on that of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and said unto him, all this will I give thee, this alone had been enough to have made him fall down and worship him.</P>
<P>In One of those <HI>Towers</HI> there is a <HI>Ring of Bels,</HI> in the other two onely, but those for worth equal to all the rest. The bigger of the two is said to be greater than that of <HI>Roven</HI> so much talked of, as being eight yards and a span in compass, and two yards and an half in depth; the bowl also of the clapper being one yard and a quarter round. Of a great weight it must needs be; and therefore (<HI>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus</HI>) there are no less than four main ropes besides their seve∣ral tayl ropes to ring it. By reason of the trouble it is never rung but in time of thunders, and these no mean ones neither. Lesser Bels will serve the lesser tempests; this is onely used in the horrider claps, and such as threaten a dissolution of <HI>Nature.</HI> But how well, as well this, as the smallest discharge that office, experience would tell us, were we void of reason; yet so much do the people affiance
<PB N="130" REF="68"/>
themselves to this conceit of the power of them, that they suppose it inherent to them continually, after the <HI>Bishop</HI> hath baptized them, which is done in this manner. The <HI>Bell</HI> being so hanged, that it may be washed within and without, in cometh the <HI>Bishop</HI> in his <HI>Episcopal</HI> robes, attended by one of his <HI>Deacons,</HI> and sitting by the <HI>Bell</HI> in his chair, saith with a loud voice the 50, 53, 56, 66, 69, 85, and 129. <HI>Psalmes,</HI> or some of them; then doth he ex∣orcize severally the <HI>Salt</HI> and the <HI>Water,</HI> and having conjured those ingredients into an <HI>holy water,</HI> he washeth with it the <HI>Bell,</HI> both on the inside and the outside; wiping it dry with a linnen cloath, he readeth the 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, <HI>Psalms</HI>; he draweth a <HI>cross</HI> on it with his right thumb dipped in hallowed oyl (<HI>chrysome</HI> they call it) and then prayeth over it. His prayer finished, he wipeth out the <HI>cross,</HI> and having said over it the 48. <HI>Psalm,</HI> he draweth on it with the same oyle seven other <HI>crosses,</HI> saying, <HI>Sanctificetur &amp; consecre∣tur Domine Campana ista, in nomine,</HI> &amp;c. After another prayer, the <HI>Bishop</HI> taketh another <HI>Censer,</HI> and putting into it Myrrh and Frankincense, set∣teth it on fire, and putteth it under the <HI>Bell,</HI> that it may all receive sume of it; this done, the 76. <HI>Psalm</HI> read, &amp; some other prayers repeated, the <HI>Bell</HI> hath received his whole and intire <HI>Baptisme,</HI> and these vertues following, <HI>viz. Ʋt per illius tactam procul pellantur omnes insidiae mimici, fragor grandinum, procella turbinum, impetus tempestatum,</HI> &amp;c. for so one of the <HI>Prayers</HI> reckoneth them: prescribed in the <HI>Roman Pontifical</HI> authorized by <HI>Clement</HI> 8th. A stranqe piece of Religion, that a <HI>Bell</HI> should be

<HI>baptized,</HI> and so much the stranger, in that those in∣animate bodies can be received into the <HI>Church</HI> by no other ministery than that of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> the true Sacrament being permitted to every <HI>Hedge-Priest.</HI></P>
<P>Not farre from the West-gate of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Nostre-dame</HI> is the <HI>Hosteldein,</HI> or <HI>le grand Hospital de Paris,</HI> first founded by <HI>King Lewis, Anno</HI> 1258. It hath been since beautified and inlarged, <HI>Anno</HI> 1535. by Mr. <HI>Anthony Prat Chancellor</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who augmented the number of the hospitallers, and gave fair revenues for the maintaining of <HI>Sur∣geons, Apothecaries,</HI> and religious men amongst them. Since that time the <HI>Provost</HI> and <HI>Eschevins</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> have been especial Benefactors unto it. At your first entrance into it you come into their <HI>Chappel,</HI> small but handsome and well furnished: After you pass into a large gallery having four ranks of beds, two close to the wals, and two in the middle. The beds are all sutable the one to the other; their vallance, curtains and rugs being all yellow. At the further end of this a door open∣ed into another chamber dedicated onely to sick <HI>women</HI>; and within them another room, wherein <HI>women</HI> with child are lightned of their burden, and their children kept till seven years of age at the charge of the <HI>Hospital.</HI> At the middle of the first gallery on the left hand, were other four ranks of beds, little differing from the rest, but that their furniture was blew, and in them there was no place for any, but such as were some way wounded, and belonged properly to the <HI>Chirurgion.</HI> There are numbred in the whole <HI>Hospital</HI> no less than seven
<PB N="132" REF="69"/>
hundred beds (besides those of attendants, <HI>Priests, Apothecaries,</HI> &amp;c.) and in every bed two persons. One would imagine, that in such a variety of wounds and diseases, a walk into it, and a view of it might savour more of curiosity than discretion. But indeed it is nothing less: for besides that, no person of an infectious disease it admitted into it, which maketh much for the safety of such as view it, all things are kept there so cleanly and orderly, that it is sweeter walking there, than in the best street of <HI>Paris,</HI> none excepted.</P>
<P>Next unto those succeeded <HI>la Saincte Chapelle</HI> scituate in the middle of the <HI>Palais</HI>: a <HI>Chappel</HI> fa∣mous for its form, but more for its <HI>Reliques.</HI> It was founded by <HI>Lewis</HI> the ninth, vulgarly called <HI>St. Lewis, Anno</HI> 1248. and is divided into two parts, the <HI>Ʋpper</HI> and the <HI>Lower:</HI> the <HI>Lower</HI> serving for the keeping of the <HI>Reliques,</HI> and the <HI>Ʋpper</HI> for celebrating of the <HI>Mass.</HI> It is a comely spruce Edifice without, but farre more curious within: the glass of it for the excellency of painting, and the <HI>Organs</HI> for the richness and elaborate work∣manship of the Case, not giving way to any in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI> I could not learn the number of <HI>Chanoins</HI> which are maintained in it, though I heard they were places of three hundred <HI>Crowns</HI> revenue. As for their <HI>Treasurer, le Threasurier,</HI> as they call their <HI>Governor,</HI> he hath granted him by especial privi∣ledge, the licence to wear all the <HI>Episcopal</HI> habits, except the <HI>Crosier-staffe,</HI> and to bear himself as a <HI>Bishop</HI> within the liberties of his <HI>Chappel.</HI> In the top of the upper <HI>Chappel</HI> (it is built almost in the form of a <HI>Synagogue</HI>) there hangeth the true pro∣portion
<PB N="133" REF="69"/>
(as they say) of the <HI>Crown of Thorns</HI>: but of this more when we have gone over the <HI>Re∣liques.</HI> I was there divers times to have seen them, but it seemeth they were not visible to a <HI>Hugonots</HI> eyes; though me thinketh they might have consi∣dered, that my money was <HI>Catholick.</HI> They are kept, as I said, in the lower <HI>Chappel,</HI> and are thus marshalled in a Table hanging in the upper. Know then that you may beleive that they can shew you the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Thornes,</HI> the bloud which ran from our <HI>Saviours</HI> breast, his swadling <HI>Clouts,</HI> and a great part of the <HI>Cross</HI> (they also of <HI>Nostre-dame</HI> have some of it,) the chain by which the <HI>Jews</HI> bound him, no small peice of the stone of the <HI>Sepulchre, Sanctam taelam tabulae insertam,</HI> which I know not how to <HI>English</HI>; some of the <HI>Virgins milk,</HI> (for I would not have those of <HI>St. Denis</HI> think the <HI>Vir∣gin</HI> gave milk to none other but to them) the head of the <HI>Launce</HI> which peirced our <HI>Saviour:</HI> the <HI>Purple Robe</HI>: the <HI>Sponge,</HI> a peice of his <HI>Shrowd</HI>: the <HI>Napkin</HI> wherewith he was girt when he washed his Disciples feet: the <HI>Rod</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> the head of <HI>St. Blase, St. Clement,</HI> and <HI>St. Simeon,</HI> and part of the head of <HI>John Baptist.</HI> Immediately under this recital of these <HI>Reliques</HI> (and venerable ones I durst say they were, could I be perswaded there were no imposture in them) there are set down a <HI>Prayer</HI> and an <HI>Antheme,</HI> both in the same Table as followeth.

Pretty <HI>divinity</HI> if one had time to examine it. These <HI>Reliques,</HI> as the Table enformeth us, were given unto <HI>St. Lewis, Anno</HI> 1247. By <HI>Baldwin</HI> the second, the last King of the <HI>Latines</HI> in <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI> to which place the <HI>Christians</HI> of <HI>Palaestine</HI> had brought them, during the time that those parts were harrowed by the <HI>Turks and Saracens.</HI> Certainly were they the same, which they are said to be, I see no harm in it if we should honour them. The very reverence due to antiquity and a silver head could not but extort some acknowledgement of respect even from a heathen. It was therefore commend∣ably done by <HI>Pope Leo,</HI> having received a parcel of the <HI>Cross</HI> from the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> that he en∣tertained it with respect. <HI>Particulam Dominicae Crucis</HI> (saith he in his 72. <HI>Epislte) cum eulogiis dilectionis tuae Veneranter accepi.</HI> To adore and worship that, or any other <HI>Relique</HI> whatsoever, with prayers and <HI>Anthems,</HI> as the <HI>Papists</HI> you see

do, never came within the minds of the <HI>Ancients,</HI> and therefore <HI>St. Ambrose</HI> calleth it <HI>Gentilis error, &amp; vanitas impiorum.</HI> This was also <HI>St. Hierom</HI>'s religion, as himself testifieth in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Ru∣parius. Nos</HI> (faith he) <HI>non dico martyrum reli∣quias, sed ne Solem quidem &amp; Lunam, non Angelos,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>colimus &amp; adoramus.</HI> Thus were those two <HI>Fathers</HI> minded towards such <HI>Reliques,</HI> as were known to be no others than what they seem∣ed: Before too many <HI>Centuries</HI> of years had con∣sumed the true ones, and the imposture of the <HI>Priests</HI> had brought in the false. Had they lived in our times, and seen the supposed <HI>Reliques</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI> not honoured onely, but adored and wor∣shipped by the blind and infatuated people, what would they have said, or rather what would they not have said: Questionless, the least they could do, were to take up the complaint of <HI>Vigilantius</HI> (the <HI>Papists</HI> reckon him for an <HI>Heretick</HI>) saying, <HI>Quid necesse est tanto honore, non solum honorare sed etiam ador are, illud nescio quid, quod in vasculo trans∣ferendo colis.</HI></P>
<P>Presently without the <HI>Chappel</HI> is the <HI>Burse la Gallerie des Merchands,</HI> a rank of shops in shew, but not in substance, like to those in the <HI>Exchange</HI> at <HI>London:</HI> It reacheth from the <HI>Chappel</HI> unto the great <HI>Hall of Parliament,</HI> and is the common through-fare between them. On the bottom of the stairs, and round about the several houses con∣secrated to the execution of justice, are sundry shops of the same nature, meanly furnished, if com∣pared with ours, yet I perswade my self the richest of this kind in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Court of Parliament</HI> was at the first insti∣tuted by <HI>Charles Marcell</HI> Grandfather to <HI>Charlemaine,</HI> at such time as he was <HI>Maior</HI> of the <HI>Palace</HI> unto the lazy and retchless <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> In the beginning of the <HI>French Empire</HI> their <HI>King</HI> did justice to the people in person. Afterwards banishing themselves from all the affairs of State, that burden was cast upon the shoulders of their <HI>Maires.</HI> An Office much of the nature with the <HI>Praefesti Praetorio</HI> in the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> When this
<PB N="138" REF="72"/>
Office was bestowed upon the said <HI>Charles Mar∣cell,</HI> he, partly weary of the trouble, partly intent about a business of a higher nature, which was the estating of the <HI>Crown</HI> in his own Posterity, but principally to indear himself to the Common peo∣ple, ordained the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Parliament, Anno</HI> 720. It consisted in the beginning of twelve <HI>Peers,</HI> the <HI>Prelates</HI> and <HI>Noblemen</HI> of the best fashion, toge∣ther with some of the principallest of the <HI>Kings Houshold.</HI> Other <HI>Courts</HI> are called the <HI>Parliament</HI> with the addition of place, as of <HI>Paris,</HI> at <HI>Roven,</HI> &amp;c. This onely <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>Parliament.</HI> It handled as well causes of <HI>State,</HI> as those of private persons. For hither did the <HI>Embassadours</HI> of mighty <HI>Princes</HI> re∣pair to have their audience and dispatch; and hi∣ther were the <HI>Articles</HI> (agreed upon in the <HI>Nati∣onal Synods</HI> of <HI>France</HI>) sent to be confirmed and verified: Here did the <HI>Subjects</HI> tender in their ho∣mages and oaths of fidelity to the <HI>King</HI>: And here were the <HI>Appeals</HI> heard of all such as had complained against <HI>Comtes,</HI> at that time the Go∣vernors and Judges in their several <HI>Counties.</HI> Be∣ing furnished thus with the prime and choisest <HI>Nobles</HI> of the <HI>Land,</HI> it grew into great estimation abroad in the world, insomuch that the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Sicily, Cyprus, Scotland, Bohemia, Portugal</HI> and <HI>Navarre,</HI> have thought it no disparagement unto them to sit in it. And which is more, when <HI>Frede∣rick</HI> the second had spent so much time in quarrels with <HI>Pope Innocent</HI> the fourth, he submitted himself and the rightness of his cause to be examined by this <HI>Noble Court of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="72"/>At the first institution of this <HI>Court</HI> it had no settled place of residence, being sometimes kept at <HI>Tholoza,</HI> sometimes at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> sometimes in other places, according as the <HI>Kings</HI> pleasure and the case of the people did require. During the time of its peregrination it was called <HI>Ambulatorie,</HI> following for the most part the <HI>Kings Court,</HI> as the lower <HI>Sphears</HI> do the motin of the <HI>Primum Mobile.</HI> But <HI>Philip le Belle</HI> (he began his raign <HI>An.</HI> 1280.) being to take a journey into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and to stay there a long space of time, for the settling of his affairs in that Countrey, took order that his <HI>Court of Parliament</HI> should stay behind him at <HI>Paris,</HI> where ever since it hath continued. Now began it to be called <HI>Sedentary,</HI> or settled, and also <HI>peu a pen</HI> by little and little to loose much of its lu∣stre: For the Cheif <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> of the <HI>Kings</HI> retinue, not able to live out of the air of the <HI>Court,</HI> withdrew themselves from the troubles of it, by which means it came at last to be appropriated to those of the long Robe, as they term them, both <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Lawyers.</HI> In the year 1463. the <HI>Pre∣lates</HI> also were removed by the <HI>Command</HI> of <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh, an utter enemy to the great ones of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> onely the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> and the <HI>Ab∣bot</HI> of <HI>St. Denis</HI> being permitted their place in it. Since which time the <HI>Professors</HI> of the <HI>Civil Law</HI> have had all the swaying in it, <HI>&amp; cedeunt arma togae,</HI> as <HI>Tully.</HI> The place in which this <HI>Sedentary Court of Parliament</HI> is now kept is called the <HI>Pala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> be∣ing built by <HI>Philip le Belle,</HI> and intended to be his <HI>Mansion</HI> or dwelling house.

assigned a part of it to his <HI>Judges</HI> of the <HI>Par∣liament,</HI> it being not totally and absolutely quitted unto them till the dayes of <HI>King Luwis</HI> the tenth. In this the <HI>French</HI> Subjects are beholding to the <HI>English</HI>; by whose good example they got the ease of a <HI>Sedentary Court</HI>: Our <HI>Law Courts</HI> also removing with the <HI>King,</HI> till the year 1224. when by a <HI>Statute</HI> in the <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> it was appoint∣ed to be fixt, and a part of the <HI>Kings Pallace</HI> in <HI>Westminster</HI> allotted for that purpose.</P>
<P>Within the <HI>Virge</HI> of this <HI>Pallace</HI> are contained the seven Chambers the <HI>Parliament.</HI> That called <HI>le grand Chambre</HI>: five Chambers of Inquisition, or <HI>des Enquests,</HI> and one other called <HI>la Tournelle.</HI> There are moreover the Chambers, <HI>des aides, des accompts, de l'ediect, des Monnoyes,</HI> and one cal∣led <HI>la Chambre Royal:</HI> of all which we shall have occasion to speak in their proper places: these not concerning the common Government of the People, but onely the <HI>Kings Revenues.</HI> Of these seven <HI>Chambers</HI> of <HI>Parliaments, le grand Chambre</HI> is most famous: and at the building of this House by <HI>Philip le belle,</HI> was intended for the <HI>Kings</HI> bed.

But their power
<PB N="143" REF="74"/>
is most eminent in disposing the affaires of <HI>State</HI> and of the <HI>Kingdome</HI>: for such prerogatives have the <HI>French Kings</HI> given hereunto, that they can neither denounce Warre, nor conclude Peace, without the consent (a formall one at the least) of this <HI>Chamber.</HI> An <HI>Alieniation</HI> of the least of the Lands of the Crown, is not any whit valued, unless confirmed by this <HI>Court</HI>; neither are his <HI>Edicts</HI> in force till they are here verified: nor his <HI>Letters Pattents</HI> for the creating of a <HI>Peere,</HI> till they are here allowed of. Most of these I confess, are little more than matters of form, the <HI>Kings</HI> power and pleasure being become boundless: yet sufficient to shew the body of Authority which they once had, and the shaddow of it which they still keep: yet of late they have got into their dis∣posing one priviledge belonging formerly to the <HI>Conventus Ordinum,</HI> or the Assembly of the three <HI>Estates</HI>; which is the conferring of the <HI>Regency,</HI> or protection of their <HI>Kings</HI> during their minori∣ty. That the Assembly of the three <HI>Estates</HI> for∣merly had this priviledge is evident by their sto∣ries. Thus we find them to have made <HI>Queene Blanche Regent</HI> of the <HI>Realm</HI> during the non-age of her Son <HI>St. Lewiis, Anno</HI> 1227. that they declared <HI>Phillip le Valois</HI> successor to the <HI>Crowne,</HI> in case that the widdow of <HI>Charles de belle,</HI> was not delivered of a Son, <HI>Anno</HI> 1328. That they made <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Daulphin Regent</HI> of <HI>France</HI> du∣ring the imprisonment of <HI>King John</HI> his Father, <HI>Anno</HI> 1357. As also <HI>Phillip</HI> of <HI>Burgony,</HI> during the Lunary <HI>Charles</HI> the sixth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1394 with divers others. On the other side, we have a

late example of the power of the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> in this very case; for the same day that <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth was slain by <HI>Raviliae,</HI> the <HI>Par∣liament</HI> met, and after a short consultation, de∣clared <HI>Mary de Medices,</HI> Mother to the <HI>King Re∣gent</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> for the Government of the State, (during the minority of her Son) with all power and authority: such are the words of the <HI>Instru∣ment,</HI> dated the 14. of <HI>May,</HI> 1610.</P>
<P>It cannot be said but this <HI>Court</HI> deserveth not onely this, but any other indulgence whereof any one member of the Common-wealth is capable. So watchful are they over the health of the <HI>State,</HI> and so tenderly do they take the least danger threatned to the liberties of that <HI>Kingdome,</HI> that they may not unjustly be called <HI>Patres Patriae.</HI> In the year 1614. they seazed upon a discourse writ∣ten by <HI>Suarez</HI> a <HI>Jesuite</HI> entitled <HI>Adversus Angli∣canae sectae errores,</HI> wherein the <HI>Popes</HI> temporal power over <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> is averred: which they sentenced to be burnt in the <HI>Pallace</HI> yard by the publick Hangman. The yeare before they in∣flicted the same punishment upon a vain and blas∣plemous discourse penned by <HI>Gasper Niopins,</HI> a fellow of a most desperate brain, and a very in∣cendiary. Neither hath <HI>Bellarmine</HI> himself that great <HI>Atlas</HI> of the <HI>Roman Church</HI> escaped much better; for writing a Book concerning the tem∣poral power of his <HI>Holiness,</HI> it had the ill luck to come into <HI>Paris,</HI> where the <HI>Parliament</HI> finding it to thwart the Liberty and Royalty of the <HI>King,</HI> and Country, gave it over to the Hangman; and he to the Fire. Thus it is evident, that the titles
<PB N="145" REF="75"/>
which the <HI>French</HI> writers gave it, as the true <HI>Tem∣ple</HI> of the <HI>French justice,</HI> the <HI>Buttresse</HI> of <HI>Equity,</HI> the <HI>Guardian</HI> of the <HI>Rights</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and the like, are abundantly deserved of it.</P>
<P>The next <HI>Chamber</HI> in esteem is the <HI>Tournelle,</HI> which handleth all matters Criminal. It is so called from <HI>Tourner,</HI> which signifieth to change or alter; because the <HI>Judges</HI> of the other several Chambers give sentence in this, according to their several turnes. The reason of which Insti∣tution is said to be, least a continual custome of condemning should make the <HI>Judges</HI> less merciful, and more prodigall of blood. An order full of health and providence; it was instituted by the above named <HI>Phillip le Belle,</HI> at the same time when he made the <HI>Parliament</HI> sedentary at <HI>Paris</HI>; and besides its particular and original employ∣ment, it receiveth Appeals from, and redresseth the errours of the <HI>Provost</HI> of <HI>Paris.</HI> The other five Chambers are called <HI>des Enquests,</HI> or <HI>Camerae Inquasitionum:</HI> the first and ancientest of them, was erected also by <HI>Phillip le Belle,</HI> and afterwards divided into two by <HI>Charles</HI> the seventh. After∣wards of <HI>Processes</HI> being greater than could be dis∣patched in these <HI>Courts,</HI> there was added a third. <HI>Francis</HI> the first established the fourth, for the better raising of a sum of money which then he wanted: every one of the new <HI>Counsellers</HI> paying right dearly for his place. The fifth and last was founded in the year 1568. In each of these seve∣rall Chambers, there be two <HI>Presidents,</HI> and twen∣ty <HI>Counsellers,</HI> beside <HI>Advocates</HI> and <HI>Proctors, ad placitum.</HI> In the <HI>Tournelle</HI> which is the aggrega∣tion
<PB N="146" REF="76"/>
of all the other <HI>Courts,</HI> there are supposed to be no fewer than two hundred <HI>Officers</HI> of all sorts, which is no great number considering the many Causes there handled. In the <HI>Tournelle,</HI> the <HI>Iud∣ges</HI> sit on matters of life and death; in the Cham∣bers of <HI>Enquests</HI> they examine onely civil Affairs, of estate, title, debts, and the like. The <HI>Plea∣ders</HI> in these <HI>Courts</HI> are called <HI>Advocates</HI>; and must be at the least <HI>Licentiats</HI> in the study of the <HI>Law.</HI> At the <HI>Parliaments</HI> of <HI>Tholoza</HI> and <HI>Bur∣deaux,</HI> they admit of none but <HI>Doctors</HI>: now the form of admitting them is this. In an open and frequent <HI>Court,</HI> one of the agedest of the <HI>Long Robe,</HI> presenteth the party which desireth admis∣sion, to the <HI>Kings Atturney General,</HI> saying with a loud voice, <HI>Paisse a Cour recevoir N. N. Licen∣cie</HI> (or <HI>Docteur) en droict civil, a l'office d' Advo∣cate.</HI> This said; the <HI>Kings Atturney</HI> biddeth him hold up his hand, and saith to him in <HI>Latine, Tu jurabis observare omnes Reges Consuetudines,</HI> he answereth <HI>Iuro,</HI> and departeth. At the Cham∣ber door of the <HI>Court,</HI> whereof he is now sworne an <HI>Advocate,</HI> he payeth two <HI>Crownes,</HI> which is forthwith put into the common Treasury, ap∣pointed for the relief of the distressed-Widdows, of ruined <HI>Advocates</HI> and <HI>Proctors: Hanc veniam pe∣timusque damusque.</HI> It may be their own cases, and therefore it is paid willingly. The highest preferment of which these <HI>Advocates</HI> are capable, is that of <HI>Chauncellor</HI>: an Office of great power and profit. The present <HI>Chauncellor</HI> is named <HI>Mr. d' Allegre,</HI> by birth of <HI>Chartres,</HI> he hath no settled <HI>Court</HI> wherein to exercise his authority; but hath
<PB N="147" REF="76"/>
in all the <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the supream place whensoever he will vouchsafe to visit them. He is also <HI>President</HI> of the <HI>Councill</HI> of <HI>Estate</HI> by his place, and on him dependeth the making of good and sacred <HI>Lawes,</HI> the administration of <HI>Justice,</HI> the reformation of superfluous, and abroga∣tion of unprofitable <HI>Edicts,</HI> &amp;c. He hath the keeping of the <HI>Kings</HI> geeat <HI>Seal,</HI> and by vertue of that, either passeth or putteth back such <HI>Letters Pattents,</HI> and <HI>Writs</HI> as are exhibited to him. He hath under him immediately for the better dis∣patch of his Affairs, four <HI>Masters</HI> of the <HI>Requests,</HI> and their <HI>Courts.</HI> Their Office and manner of proceeding is the same, which they also use in <HI>England</HI>: in the persons there is thus much diffe∣rence, that in <HI>Franee</HI> two of them must be per∣petually of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> One of their <HI>Courts</HI> is ve∣ry ancient, and hath in it two <HI>Presidents.</HI> which are two of the <HI>Masters,</HI> and fourteen <HI>Counsellers.</HI> The other is of a later erection; as being founded <HI>Anno</HI> 1580. and in that the two other of the <HI>Ma∣sters,</HI> and eight <HI>Councellers</HI> give sentence.</P>
<P>Thus have I taken a veiw of the several <HI>Cham∣bers</HI> of the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and of their parti∣cular Jurisdictions, as far as my information could conduct me.

<P>WE have discharged the <HI>King</HI> of one <HI>Pallace,</HI> and must follow him to the other, where we shall find his residence. It is seated in the west side of the Town or <HI>Ville</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> hard by <HI>Porte neufue,</HI> and also by the new Bridge. An House of great fame, and which the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have long kept their <HI>Courts</HI> in. It was first built by <HI>Phillip Augustus, anno</HI> 1214. and by him intended for a Castle, it then serving to imprison the more <HI>potent of the Noblesse,</HI> and to
<PB N="150" REF="78"/>
lay up the <HI>Kings</HI> Treasury; for that cause it was well moated and strengthened with walls and draw Bridges, very serviceable in those times. It had the name of <HI>Louure quasi L'oeuure,</HI> or the work: the Building by way of excellencie. An <HI>Etymologie</HI> which draweth nigher to the ear than the understanding, or the eye. And yet the <HI>French</HI> writers would make it a miracle: <HI>Du Chesne</HI> cal∣leth it <HI>superbe bastiment qui n' a son esgal en toute la Christiente</HI>: and you shall hear it called in ano∣ther place, <HI>Bastiment qui passe muiourd huy en ex∣cellenee et en grandeur, tous les autres.</HI> Brave <HI>E∣ligies,</HI> if all were Gold that glistered. It hath given up now its charge of money, and great pri∣soners to the <HI>Bastile</HI>; and at this time serveth on∣ly to imprison the <HI>Court.</HI> In my life I never saw any thing more abused by a good report, or that more belyeth the rumours that go of it. The ordinary talk of vulgar travellers, and the bigg words of the <HI>French</HI> had made me expect at the least some prodigie of Architecture, some such Majestical house as the <HI>Sunne Don Phoebus</HI> is said to have dwelt in by <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>

<P>Indeed I thought no fiction in <HI>Poetry</HI> had been able to have parralell'd it; and made no doubt but it would have put me into such a passion▪ as to have cryed out with the young Gallant in the <HI>Comidie,</HI> when he saw his <HI>Sweet heart; Hei mi∣hi

The Fable of the <HI>Mountaine</HI> which was with child, and brought forth a Mouse, is question∣less a Fable. This House, and the large fame it hath in the world is the <HI>Morall</HI> of it. Never was there an House more unsuitable to it self in the particular examination of parts, nor more unsu∣table to the Character and esteem of it in the ge∣neral survey of the whole.</P>
<P>You enter into it over two <HI>Draw-bridges</HI>; and thorough three <HI>Gates,</HI> ruinous enough and abun∣dantly unsightly. In the <HI>Quadrangle</HI> you meet with three several fashions of buildings, of three several ages; and they so unhappily joyned one to the other, that one would half beleeve they were clapped together by an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> The <HI>South</HI> and <HI>West</HI> parts of it are new, and indeed <HI>Prince like,</HI> being the work of <HI>Francis</HI> the first, and his Son <HI>Henry</HI>: had it been all cast into the same mould, I perswade my self, that it would be very gratious and lovely. The other two are of an∣cient work and so contemptible, that they dis∣grace the rest: and of these I suppose the one to be at the least a hundred years older than his part∣ner: such is it without. As for the inside it is farre more graceful, and would be pleasing at the entrance, were the <HI>Gaurd Chamber</HI> reformed. Some <HI>Hugonot Architect</HI> which were not in love with the errours of Antiquity, might make a pret∣ty room of it: a <HI>Catholick Carpenter</HI> would never get credit by it; for whereas the provident thrift
<PB N="152" REF="79"/>
of our fore fathers intended it (for the House would else be too narrow for the <HI>Kings</HI> retinue) both for a room of safety and of pleasure, both for <HI>Bellmen</HI> and <HI>Dancers</HI>; and for that cause made up some six ranks of seats on each side. That spa∣ringness in the more curious eyes of this time is little <HI>King like.</HI> Country wenches might with an indifferent stomack abuse a Galliard in it, or it might perhaps serve, with a Stage at one end, to entertain the <HI>Parisiens</HI> at a Play; or with a par∣tition in the middle, it might be divided into pretty plausible <HI>Cockpits.</HI> But to be employed in the nature it is now, either to solace the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Lords</HI> in a dance, or to give any forraign <HI>Am∣bassadour</HI> his welcome in a <HI>Masque,</HI> is little su∣table with the majesty of a <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>Chambers</HI> of it are well built, but ill furnished; the hangings of them being somewhat below a meanness: and yet of these here is no small scarcity, for as it is said of the <HI>Gymnosophists</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> that <HI>Ʋnadomus et mansioni sufficit et sepulturae:</HI> so may we of this <HI>Prince.</HI> The same Chamber serveth for to Iodge him, feed him, &amp; also to confer &amp; discourse with his <HI>Nobility.</HI> But like enough it is that this want may proceed from the several <HI>Courts</HI> of the <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Monsieur,</HI> the <HI>Queene Mother,</HI> and the <HI>Queene Regnant,</HI> being all kept within it.</P>
<P>Proceed we now to the two <HI>Galleries,</HI> where∣of the first is that of the <HI>Queene Mother,</HI> as being beautified and adorned exceedingly, by <HI>Cathe∣rine de Medices,</HI> Mother to <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth. It containeth the Pictures of all the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and the most loved of
<PB N="153" REF="79"/>
their <HI>Queens</HI> since the time of <HI>St. Lewis.</HI> They stand each <HI>King</HI> opposite to his <HI>Queen,</HI> she being that of his Wives, which either brought him most estate, or his <HI>Successor.</HI> The tables are all of a just length, very fair, and according to my little ac∣quaintance with the Painter, of a most excellent workmanship. And which addeth more grace to it, they are in a manner a perfect history of the State and Court of <HI>France</HI> in their several times, For under each of the <HI>Kings</HI> pictures they have drawn the potraitures of most of their <HI>Lords,</HI> whom valour and true courage in the field enno∣bled beyond their births: Under each of the <HI>Queens,</HI> the lively shapes of the most principal <HI>La∣dies,</HI> whose beauty and vertue had honoured the Court. A dainty invention, and happily expres∣sed. At the further end of it stand the last <HI>King,</HI> and the present <HI>Queen Mother,</HI> who fill up the whole room. The succeeding <HI>Princes,</HI> if they mean to live in their pictures, must either build new places for them, or else make use of the Long Gallery built by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and which o∣peneth in to that of the <HI>Queen Mother.</HI> A Galle∣ry it is of an incredible length, as being above 500. yards long, and of a breadth and height not un∣proportionable. A room built rather for often∣tation than use, and such as hath more in it of the <HI>Majesty</HI> of ist Founder than the <HI>Grace</HI>: It is said to have been erected purposely to joyn the <HI>Louure</HI> unto the house and garden of the <HI>Tuilleries</HI>: an unlikely matter, that such a stupendious building should be designed onely for a cleanly convey∣ance into a Summer-house. Others are of opinion,
<PB N="154" REF="80"/>
that he had a resolution to have the House qua∣drangular, every side being correspondent to this, which should have been the common Gallery to the rest, which design had it taken effect, this <HI>Pa∣lace</HI> would at once have been the wonder of the world, and the envy of it. For my part I dare be of the last mind, as well because the second is in part begun, as also considering how infinitely this <HI>King</HI> was affected to building. The place <HI>Daulphin,</HI> and the place <HI>Royal,</HI> two of the finest piles of <HI>Paris,</HI> were erected partly by his purse, but principally by his encouragement. The new <HI>Bridge</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> was meerly his work; so was also the new <HI>Palace,</HI> and the most admirable <HI>Water-Works of St. Germanen∣lay</HI>; this long <HI>Gallery</HI> and the <HI>Pesthouse</HI> owe them∣selves wholly unto him, and the house of <HI>Fountain bleau,</HI> which is the fairest in <HI>France,</HI> is beholding to him for most of its beauty. Adde to this his fortifications bestowed on the <HI>Bastile,</HI> and his pur∣pose to have strengthened <HI>Paris</HI> according to the modern art of Towns, and you will find the attri∣bute of <HI>Parietaria</HI> or <HI>Wall-floure,</HI> which <HI>Constantine</HI> scoffingly gave unto <HI>Trajane</HI> for his great humour of building, to be due unto this <HI>King,</HI> but seriously and with reverence.</P>
<P>Besides the general love he had to building, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had also an ambition to go beyond ensample, which also induceth me further to beleive his in∣tent of making that large and admirable quadran∣gle above spoken of, to have been serious and real. For to omit others, certain it is, that he had a pro∣ject of great spirit and difficulty, which was to joyn the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea and the <HI>Ocean</HI> toge∣ther;
<PB N="155" REF="80"/>
and to make the navigation from the one to the other through <HI>France,</HI> and not to pass by the straight of <HI>Gibraltare.</HI> It came into counsel <HI>Anno</HI> 1604. and was resolved to be done by this meanes. The River of <HI>Garond</HI> is navigable from the <HI>Ocean</HI> almost to <HI>Tholoza</HI>; and the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> open∣eth it self into the land by a little River (whose name I know not) as high as <HI>Narbonne.</HI> Betwixt these two places was there a navigable channel to have been digged, and it proceeded so far towards being actuated, that a workman had undertaken it, and the price was agreed upon. But there arising some discontents between the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> about the building of the <HI>Fort Fuentis,</HI> in the Countrey of the <HI>Grisons</HI>; the King not know∣ing what use he might have of treasure in that quar∣rel, commanded the work not to go forward: However it is to be commended in the attempt, which was indeed Kingly, and worthy his spirit, and praise him in his heroick purpose and de∣sign:</P>
<Q>Quem si non tenuit, magnis tamen excidit ausis.</Q>
<P>But the principal beauty, if I may judge of this so much admired Palace of the <HI>Louure,</HI> is a low plain room, paved under foot with brick, and without any hangings or tapestry on the sides; yet being the best set out and furnished, to my content, of any in <HI>France</HI>: It is called <HI>La salle des Antiques,</HI> and hath in it five of the ancientest and venera∣blest pieces of all the <HI>Kingdom</HI>: For the <HI>Nation</HI> ge∣nerally is regardless of antiquity, both in the mo∣numents
<PB N="156" REF="81"/>
and in the study of it; so that you shall hardly find any ancient inscription, or any famous ruine snatched from the hand of time, in the best of their <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Churches.</HI> In the <HI>Church</HI> onely of <HI>Amiens</HI> could I meet with any antient Character; which also was but a <HI>Gothish Dutch Letter,</HI> and ex∣pressed nothing but the name and vertue of a <HI>Bi∣shop</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> in whose time it was. So little also did I perceive them to be inclining to be <HI>An∣tiquaries</HI>; that both neglects considered (<HI>si Verbis audaciadetur</HI>) I dare confidently averre, that one <HI>Cotton</HI> for the Treasury, and one <HI>Selden</HI> (now Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> is dead) for the study of Antiquities, are worth all the <HI>French:</HI> As for these five peices in <HI>La salle des Antiques,</HI> they are, I confess, worthy our observation, and respect also, if they be such as our trudgeman informed us. At the further end of it, the <HI>Statua</HI> of <HI>Diana,</HI> the same (as it is said) which was worshipped in the renowned Temple of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and of which <HI>Demetrius</HI> the Silver∣smith and his fellow Artists cried out, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Great is <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>Ephesians</HI>: Of a large and manly proportion she seemeth to be.

She is all naked save her feet, which are buskin'd, and yet she hath a scarfe or linnen roul, which coming over her left shoulder, and meeting about her middle, hung down with both ends of it a little lower. In the first place towards the right hand,

as we descended towards the door, was the <HI>Statua</HI> of one of the <HI>Gods of Aethiopia,</HI> as black as any of his people, and one that had nothing about him to express his particular being.

They were bestowed on the <HI>King</HI> by his Holiness of <HI>Rome,</HI> and I cannot blame him for it.

<P>Without this room, the <HI>Salle des Antiques</HI>; and somewhat on the other side of the <HI>Louure</HI> is the House of <HI>Burbon,</HI> and old decayed fabrick, in which was nothing observable but the <HI>Omen.</HI> For being built by <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Burbon</HI> the third <HI>Duke</HI> of that branch; he caused this Motto, <HI>ESPE∣RANCE,</HI> to be engraven in Capital Letters over the door, signifying his hopes, that from his loyns should proceed a <HI>King,</HI> which should joyn both the Houses and the Families, and it is accord∣ingly happened.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="160" REF="83"/>THe <HI>King</HI> is the soul of the Court, without his presence it is but a Carcass, a thing without life and honour. I dare not so farre wrong the <HI>Louure,</HI> as to make it but a common house, and rob it of the fruition of its <HI>Prince,</HI> and therefore will treat of him here; though during my aboad in <HI>France</HI> he lay all the while in <HI>Fountain Bleau</HI>: For person he is of the middle stature, and rather well proportioned than large. His face knoweth little yet of a beard, but that which is, is black and swar∣thy; his complexion also much of the same heiw, carrying in it a certain boysterousness, and that in a further measure than what a graceful Majesty can admit of: So that one can hardly say of him with∣out a spice of Courtship, what <HI>Paterculus</HI> did of <HI>Tiberius, Quod visus praetulerit principem,</HI> that his countenance proclaimed him a <HI>King.</HI> But questi∣onless his greatest defect is want of utterance, which is very unpleasing by reason of a desperate and un∣curable stammering, which defect is likely more and more to grow upon him. At this time he is aged twenty four years, and as much as since the 27 day of <HI>September</HI> last, which was his birth day, an age which he beareth not very plausibly; want of beard and the swarthiness of his complexion ma∣king him seem elder. At the age of eleven years he was affianced to the <HI>Lady Anna Infanta of Spain,</HI> by whom as yet he hath no children. It is thought by many, and covertly spoken by divers in <HI>France,</HI> that the principal cause of the <HI>Queens</HI> bar∣tenness proceedeth from <HI>Spain,</HI> that people being loath to fall under the <HI>French</HI> obedience, which may very well happen, she being the elder Sister of
<PB N="161" REF="83"/>
the <HI>King.</HI> For this cause, in the seventh article of marriage there is a clause, that neither the said <HI>In∣fanta,</HI> nor the Children born by her (to the <HI>King</HI>) shall be capable to inherit any of the estates of the <HI>King of Spain</HI>; and in the eighth article she is bound to make an act of renunciation under her own hand-writing, as soon as she cometh to be twelve years old, which was accordingly performed. But this being not sufficient to secure their fears, it is thought that she was some way or other disabled from conception, before ever she came into the <HI>Kings</HI> embraces: A great crime I confess if true: yet I cannot say with <HI>Tully</HI> in his defence of <HI>Li∣garius: Novum crimen Caie Caesar, &amp; hec tempus mauditum. Jaqueline Countess of Holland</HI> was Co∣zen to <HI>Philip Duke</HI> of <HI>Burgundie</HI>: Her being fruit∣ful would have debarred him from those estates of <HI>Holland, Zealand</HI> and <HI>West-Freezland</HI>; therefore though she had three Husbands there was order taken she should never have Child: with her two first Husbands the <HI>Duke</HI> would never suffer her to live: and when she had stollen a wedding with <HI>Frane of Borselle</HI> one of her servants, the <HI>Dukes Physitians</HI> gave him such a potion, that she might as well have married an <HI>Eunuch</HI>: upon this injury the poor <HI>Lady</HI> died; and the <HI>Duke</HI> succeeded in those Countries; which by his Grand-child <HI>Marie</HI> were conveyed over into the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> together with the rest of his estate. I dare not say, that that Family hath inherited his practises with his lands; and yet I have heard, that the <HI>Infanta Isabella</HI> had the like or worse measure afforded her, before she was bedded to the <HI>Arch-duke Al∣bertus.</HI>

A diabolical trick, which the prostitutes of the heathen used in the beginnings of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and before, of whom <HI>Octavius</HI> complaineth, <HI>quod originem futuri hominis extinguant, &amp; paricidium faciunt, antequam pariunt.</HI></P>
<P>Better luck than the <HI>King</HI> hath his Sister beyond the mountains, I mean his eldest Sister <HI>Madame Elizabeth,</HI> married to the <HI>King of Spain</HI> now living, as being, or having been the Mother of two Chil∣dren: His second Sister, <HI>Madame Christian,</HI> is married to <HI>Amadeo Victor Principe Maior,</HI> or heir apparent of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> to whom as yet she hath born no issue. The youngest, <HI>Henrietta Mariae,</HI> is newly married to his most Excellent Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> to whom may she prove of a most happy and fruitful womb. <HI>Et pulchra faciat te prole parentem.</HI> Of these alliances the first were very profitable to both <HI>Princes,</HI> could there be made a marriage between the Kingdoms as well as the <HI>Kings.</HI> But it is well known, that the affecti∣ons of each people are divided, more unconquera∣ble mountains, than their dominions: The <HI>French</HI> extreamly hating the proud humour and ambition of the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> We may therefore account each of them in these marriages to have rather intend∣ed the perpetuity of their particular houses, than the strength of their Empires; and that they more desired a noble stock whereon to graft posterity, than power. The alliance with <HI>Savoy</HI> is more ad∣vantagious, though less powerful than that of <HI>Spain.</HI> For if the <HI>King of France</HI> can keep this <HI>Prince</HI> on his party, he need not fear the greatness of the other, or any of his faction. The continu∣all
<PB N="163" REF="84"/>
siding of this House with that of <HI>Austria,</HI> ha∣ving given many and great impediments to the fortune of the <HI>French.</HI> It standeth so fitly to coun∣tenance the affairs of either <HI>King</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Ger∣many</HI> to which it shall incline, that it is just of the same nature with the estate of <HI>Florence</HI> between <HI>Millain</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI>: of which <HI>Guicciaraine</HI> saith, that <HI>Mantennero le cose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Italia bilan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iate</HI> On this reason <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth earnestly desired to match one of his Children into this Countrey, and left this desire as a Legacie with his Council. But the alliance of most use to the State of <HI>France,</HI> is that of <HI>England,</HI> as being the nighest and most able of all his neighbours. An alliance which will make his Estate invincible, and incompassed about as it were with a wall of brass.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Kings</HI> bastard Brethren they are four in number, and born of three several beds. The eldest is <HI>Mr. Alexander,</HI> made <HI>Knight</HI> of the Or∣der of St. <HI>John,</HI> or of <HI>Malta,</HI> in the life time of his Father. He is now <HI>Grand Prior of France,</HI> and it is much laboured and hoped by the <HI>French,</HI> that he shall be the next Master of the <HI>Order</HI>; a place of great command and credit. The second and most loved of his Father, whose lively image and character he is said to be, is <HI>Mr Caesar,</HI> made <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Vendosme</HI> by his Father, and is at this time Go∣vernor of <HI>Brittain,</HI> a man of a brave spirit, and one who swayeth much in the affairs of State. His Father took great care for his advancement before his death, and therefore married him to the Daughter and Heir of the <HI>Duke of Mercuer,</HI> a man of great possessions in <HI>Brittain.</HI> It is thought
<PB N="164" REF="85"/>
that the inheritance of this <HI>Lady,</HI>-both by her Fa∣thers side, and also by her Mothers, who was of the Family of <HI>Marsegues,</HI> being a stock of the old <HI>Ducal</HI> tree, is no less than 200000. Crowns year∣ly. Both these were born unto the <HI>King</HI> by <HI>Ma∣dame Gabriele,</HI> for her excellent beauty surnamed <HI>la¦belle, Dutchess of Beauforte,</HI> a <HI>Lady</HI> whom the <HI>King</HI> most entirely affected even to the last gasp, and one who never abused her power with him; so that we may truly say of her what <HI>Velleius</HI> flatter∣ingly said of <HI>Livia</HI> the Wife of <HI>Augustus, Ejus potentiam nemo senset, nisi levatione periculi, aut ac∣cessione dignitatis.</HI> The third of the <HI>Kings</HI> natural Brethren is Mr. <HI>Henry,</HI> now <HI>Bishop of Metz</HI> in <HI>Lor∣raine,</HI> and <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>St. Germans</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> As <HI>Abbot</HI> he is Lord of the goodly <HI>Fairbourg</HI> of <HI>St. Ger∣mans,</HI> and hath the profits of the great Fair there holden, which make a large revenue. His Bisho∣prick yeildeth him the profits of 20000. Crowns and upwards, which is the remainder of 60000. the rest being pawned to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> by the last Bishop, who was of that family. The Mo∣ther of this Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> is the <HI>Marchioness of Verne∣ville,</HI> who before the death of the <HI>King</HI> fell out of his favour into the prison, and was not restored to her liberty till the beginning of the <HI>Queen Mo∣thers Regency.</HI> The fourth and youngest is Mr. <HI>Antonie,</HI> born unto the <HI>King</HI> by the <HI>Countess of Morret,</HI> who is <HI>Abbot</HI> of the Churches of <HI>Marseil∣les</HI> and <HI>Cave</HI>▪ &amp; hath as yet not fully six thousand pound a year, when his Mother dieth he Will be richer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kings</HI> lawful Brother is named <HI>John Baptist
<PB N="165" REF="85"/>
Gaston,</HI> born the 25th of <HI>April, Anno</HI> 1608. A Prince of a brave and manlike aspect, likely to in∣herit as large a part of his Fathers spirit, as the <HI>King</HI> doth of his Crown. He is entituled <HI>Duke of Aniou,</HI> as being the third Son of <HI>France,</HI> but his next elder Brother the <HI>Duke of Orleance</HI> being dead in his childhood, he is vulgarly and properly called, <HI>Monsieur.</HI> This title is different from that of <HI>Daulphin,</HI> in that that title is onely appropria∣ted to the Heir apparent, being the <HI>Kings</HI> eldest Son living. This limited to the Heir apparent, be∣ing the <HI>Kings</HI> eldest Brother surviving; if there be neither Son nor Brother, then the next Heir ap∣parent is stiled onely <HI>Le primier Prince du sang, The first Prince of the bloud.</HI> This title of <HI>Mon∣sieur</HI> answereth to that of the <HI>Despote</HI> in the <HI>Greek Empire</HI>; and in imitation of that it is thought to have been instituted. Others of the <HI>French</HI> Princes are called <HI>Monsieurs</HI> also, but with some addition of place or honour; the <HI>Kings</HI> eldest Brother onely is called <HI>Monsieur sans quene,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> use to say; that is, simply <HI>Monsieur.</HI> This young Prince is as yet unmarried, but destinate to the bed of the young <HI>Dutchess of Mont-pensier,</HI> whose Fa∣ther died in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth. Had the <HI>Duke of Orleance</HI> lived, he had espoused her long ere this; but it is generally beleived, that this <HI>Prince</HI> is so affected. He seeth his elder Brother as yet childless, himself the next Heir to the Crown, and it is likely he will look on a while, and expect the issue of his fortune.</P>
<P>Some that speak of the affairs of the Court, hold her to be a fit match for the young <HI>Count of
<PB N="166" REF="86"/>
Soisons,</HI> a Prince of the bloud, and a Gentleman of a fine temper. The <HI>Lady</HI> her self is said not to be averse from the Match; neither will the <HI>King</HI> not be inclinable unto him, as hoping therein to give him some satisfaction, for not performing a Court promise, made unto him about marrying him to the young <HI>Madame,</HI> now <HI>Queen of England.</HI> As for the <HI>Count</HI> it cannot but be advantagious to him divers wayes; partly to joyn together the two Fa∣milies of <HI>Mont pensier</HI> and <HI>Soisons,</HI> both issuing from the house of <HI>Burbon</HI>; partly to enrich him∣self by adding unto his inheritance so fair an e∣state; and partly by gaining all the Freinds and Allies of the <HI>Ladies</HI> kinred unto him; the better to enable his opposition against the <HI>Prince of Con∣de.</HI> The difference between them standeth thus: <HI>Lewis</HI> the first <HI>Prince of Conde</HI> had by two Wives, amongst other Children, two Sons; by his first Wife <HI>Henry Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde,</HI> by the second <HI>Charles Count of Soisons. Henry Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde</HI> had to his first Wife <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Cleve,</HI> Daughter to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Nevers,</HI> by whom he had no Children: to his second Wife he took the <HI>Lady Katherine</HI> of <HI>Tre∣moville,</HI> Sister to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Thovars, Anno</HI> 1586. two years after his marriage he died of an old greif took from a poysoned cup, which was given him, <HI>Anno</HI> 1552. and partly from a blow given him with a Lance at the battel of <HI>Contras, Anno</HI> 1587. In the eleventh moneth after his decease, his young <HI>Princess</HI> was brought to bed of a young Son, which is now <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde. Charles Count</HI> of <HI>Soisons</HI> in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth began to question the <HI>Princes</HI> legitimation; whereupon the <HI>King</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="86"/>
dealt with the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> to declare the place of the first <HI>Prince</HI> of the bloud to belong to the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde</HI>: And for the clearer and more evident proof of the title, twenty four physitians of good faith and skill made an open protestation of oath in the Coutt, that it was not onely possible but common for Women to be delivered in the eleventh moneth. On this it was awarded to the <HI>Prince.</HI></P>
<P>This decree of Parliament notwithstanding, if ever the King and his Brother should die childless, it is said, that the young <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Soisons</HI> (his Fa∣ther died <HI>Anno</HI> 1614.) will not so give over his title: He is <HI>Steward</HI> of the <HI>Kings</HI> House, as his Fa∣ther also was before him, a place of good credit, and in which he hath demeaned himself very plau∣sibly. In case it should come to a tryal, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which God forbid, he is like to make a great party▪ both within the Realm and without it; with∣out it by means of the House of <HI>Savoy,</HI> having mar∣ried his eldest Sister unto <HI>Don Thomazo,</HI> the second Son of that <HI>Dukedom</HI> now living: A brave man at armes, and indeed the fairest fruit that ever grew on that tree, next Heir of his Father after the death of <HI>Don Amadeo,</HI> yet childless: within the Realm the <HI>Lords</HI> have already declared themselves, which happened on this occasion. In the year 1620. the moneth of <HI>March,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> being to wash, the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde</HI> laid hold on the towel, chalenging that honour as first <HI>Prince</HI> of the bloud: and on the other side the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Soisons</HI> seized on it as appertaining to his office of <HI>Steward,</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> of the bloud also. The <HI>King</HI> to decide the contro∣versie
<PB N="168" REF="87"/>
for the present, commanded it to be given to <HI>Monsieur</HI> his Brother, yet did not this satisfie. For in the morning the Friends of both <HI>Princes</HI> came to offer their service in the cause. To the <HI>Count</HI> came in general all the opposites of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde,</HI> and of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Luines</HI> and <HI>Guise</HI>; in particular the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Maien,</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Ven∣dosme,</HI> the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Longueville, Espernon, Nemours,</HI> the <HI>Grand Prior,</HI> the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Thovars, Retz</HI> and <HI>Rohan,</HI> the <HI>Viscount</HI> of <HI>Aubetene,</HI> &amp;c. who all with∣drew themselves from the Court, made themselves Masters of the best places in their Governments, and were united presently into an open faction, of which the <HI>Queen Mother</HI> declared her self head. As for the Commons, without whom the Nobility may well quarrel, but not fight, they are more zea∣lous in behalf of the <HI>Count,</HI> as being brought up alwayes a <HI>Papist,</HI> and born of a Catholike kin∣red, whereas the <HI>Prince,</HI> though at this instant he be a Catholike, yet <HI>non fuit sic ab initio,</HI> he was born, they say, and brought up an <HI>Hugonot,</HI> and perchance the alteration is but dissem∣bled.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Prince of Conde,</HI> he hath a sen∣tence of Parliament on his side, and a verdict of Physitians, both weak helps to a soveraignty, unless well backed by the Sword. And for the verdict of the Physitians, thus the case is stated by the Doctors of that faculty. <HI>Laurentius</HI> a Professor of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt-pellier</HI> in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> in his excellent Treatise of Anatomy, maketh three terms of a Womans delivery, <HI>Primus, intermedius, &amp; ultimus</HI>: The first, the seventh and eighth moneth after con∣ception,
<PB N="169" REF="87"/>
in each of which the Child is vital and may live if it be born. To this also consenteth the Dr. of their <HI>Chair Hippocrates,</HI> saying, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that a Child born in the seventh moneth, if it be well looked to, may live. We read also, how in <HI>Spain</HI> the Women are oftentimes lightned in the end of the seventh moneth, and commonly in the end of the eighth: and further, that <HI>Sempronius</HI> and <HI>Corbula,</HI> both <HI>Roman Consuls,</HI> were born in the seventh moneth: <HI>Plinie</HI> in his natural History reporteth it as a truth, though per∣haps the Women that told him either misreckoned their time, or else dissembled it to conceal their honesties. The middle time (<HI>terminus interme∣dius</HI>) is the ninth and tenth moneths, at which time Children do seldom miscarry: In the former two moneths they had gathered life, in these later they onely consummate strength, so say the <HI>Physi∣tians</HI> generally. <HI>Non enim in duobus sequentibus mensibus</HI> (they speak it of the <HI>intermedii) addi∣tur aliquid ad perfectionem partium, sed ad perfectio∣nem roboris.</HI> The last time (<HI>terminus ultimus</HI>) in the common account of this Profession is the ele∣venth moneth, which some of them hold neither unlikely nor rare. <HI>Massurius</HI> recordeth of <HI>Pa∣pyrius,</HI> a <HI>Roman Praetor,</HI> to have recovered his inhe∣ritance in open Court, though his Mother confest him to be born in the thirteenth month. And <HI>A∣vicen</HI> a <HI>Moor</HI> of <HI>Corduba</HI> relateth (as he is cited in <HI>Laurentius</HI>) that he had seen a Child born after the fourteenth. But these are but the impostures of Women; and yet indeed the modern Doctors are more charitable, and refer it to supernatural causes,
<PB N="170" REF="88"/>
<HI>Ʋt extra ordinariam artis considerationem.</HI> On the other side <HI>Hippocrates</HI> giveth it out definitively, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that in ten moneths at the furthest (understand ten moneths compleat) the Child is born. And <HI>Ʋlpian</HI> the great <HI>Civilian</HI> of his times, in the title of <HI>Digests de Testamentis</HI> is of opinion, that a Child born af∣ter the tenth moneth (compleat) is not to be admitted to the inheritance of its pretended Fa∣ther. As for the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> as I remember, I have read it in a book written of <HI>Wils</HI> and <HI>Testaments,</HI> it taketh a middle course between the charity of nature and the severity of Law, lea∣ving it meerly to the conscience and circumstance of the <HI>Judge.</HI></P>
<P>But all this must be conceived (taking it in the most favourable construction) after the concep∣tion of the <HI>Mother,</HI> and by no meanes after the death of the <HI>Father,</HI> and so can it no way (if I were first <HI>President</HI>) advantage the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Con∣de</HI>: His Father had been extreamly sick no small time before his death for the particular, and suppo∣sed since his poison taken, <HI>Anno</HI> 1552. to be little prone to Women in the general. They therefore that would seem to know more than the vul∣gar, reckon him as one of the by-blows of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, but this under the <HI>Rose:</HI> yet by way of conjecture we may argue thus. First, from the <HI>Kings</HI> care of his education, assigning him for his <HI>Tutor Nicholas de Februe,</HI> whom he also designed for his Son <HI>King Lewis.</HI> Secondly, from his care to work the <HI>Prince,</HI> then young, <HI>Mollis &amp; aptus agi,</HI> to become a <HI>Catholike.</HI> Thirdly, the age of the

old <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the privacy of this <HI>King</HI> with his <HI>Lady,</HI> being then <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Navarre,</HI> in the prime of his strength, and in discontent with the <HI>Lady Margaret</HI> of <HI>Valoys</HI> his first Wife. Adde to this that <HI>Kings</HI> love to fair <HI>Ladies</HI> in the general, and we may see this probability to be no miracle: For besides the <HI>Dutchess</HI> of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> the <HI>Marchio∣ness</HI> of <HI>Verneville,</HI> and the <HI>Countess</HI> of <HI>Morret</HI> al∣ready mentioned, he is beleived to have been the <HI>Father</HI> of Mr. <HI>Luines</HI> the great Favorite of <HI>King Lewis.</HI> And certain it is, that the very year before his death, when he was even in the winter of his dayes, he took such an amorous liking to the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde,</HI>s Wife, a very beautiful <HI>Lady,</HI> and Daugh∣ter to the Constable <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Montmorencie,</HI> that the <HI>Prince</HI> to save his honour was compelled to flie, together with his <HI>Princess,</HI> into the <HI>Arch-Dukes Country,</HI> whence he returned not till long after the death of <HI>King Henry.</HI> If <HI>Marie de Me∣dices</HI> in her Husbands life time paid his debts for him (which I cannot say) she onely made good that of <HI>Quintilian, Et uxor mariti exemplo incitata, aut imitari se putat, aut vindicate</HI>· And yet per∣haps a consciousness of some injuries not onely moved her to back the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Soison's</HI> and his faction against the <HI>Prince</HI> and his, but also to resolve upon him for the Husband of her Daugh∣ter.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Princes</HI> of the bloud descend we to the <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI> and therein the first place we meet with <HI>Mr. Barradas,</HI> the <HI>Kings</HI> present Favourite, a young Gentleman of a fresh and lively hew, little bearded, and one whom the

He is also the Master of the <HI>Horse,</HI> or <HI>le grand Escuire</HI>; the esteem of which place recompenceth the emp∣tiness of the other; for by vertue of this Office he carryeth the <HI>Kings</HI> Sword sheathed before him at his entrance into <HI>Paris</HI>: the Cloth of Estate car∣ryed over the <HI>King</HI> by the <HI>Provosts</HI> and <HI>Eschevins,</HI> is his <HI>Fee.</HI> No man can be the <HI>Kings</HI> Spur maker, his Smith, or have any place in the <HI>Kings</HI> Stables but from him, and the like.

<P>And to say truth, he is as yet but a little better, being onely removed from his Servant to his <HI>play-fellow:</HI> with the affairs of <HI>State</HI> he intermeddleth not; if he should, he might expect the <HI>Queene Mother</HI> should say to him, what <HI>Apollo</HI> in <HI>Ovid</HI> did to <HI>Cupid.</HI></P>

<P>FRom the Court of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> I can∣not better provide for my self, than to have recourse unto the Court of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and though the <HI>Poet</HI> meant not <HI>Exeat aulâ qui vult esse pius</HI> in that sense, yet will it be no trea∣son for me to apply it so.

by authority, and he came out <HI>red all o∣ver like a hairy Garment,</HI> saith the text, which very oppositely expresseth the bloody and rough condition of the <HI>French</HI> Papist at the birth of the Reformation: before experience and long ac∣quaintance had bred a liking between them. And after came his Brother out, which laid hold on <HI>Esaus</HI> heel, and his name was called <HI>Jacob</HI>: where∣in is described the quality of the <HI>Protestant party</HI>: which though confirmed by publick <HI>Edict</HI> after the other, yet hath it divers times endeavoured, and will perchance one day effect the tripping up of the others heeles. And <HI>Esau</HI> (saith <HI>Moses) was a cunning hunter; a man of the field: but Jacob was a plain man dwelling in Tents.</HI> In which words the comparison is most exact. A cunning Archer in the Scriptures, signifieth a man of Art and Po∣wer mingled: as when <HI>Nimrod</HI> in the 10th of <HI>Ge∣neses</HI> is termed, <HI>A mighty Hunter.</HI> Such is the <HI>Papist,</HI> a side of greater strength and subtilty, a side of warre, and of the field. On the other side the <HI>Protestants</HI> are a plain race of men, simple in their actions, without craft and fraudulent beha∣haviour, and dwelling in Tents, that is, having no certain abiding place, no one <HI>Province</HI> which they can call theirs, but living dispersed and scat∣terred over the Country; which in the phrase of Scripture, is dwelling in Tents. As for the other words differencing the two Brethren, <HI>and the el∣der shall serve the younger,</HI> they are rather to be accounted a Prophesie, than a Character: we must therefore leave the <HI>Analogie</HI> it holds with the <HI>Rebecca</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and her two Sons, to the e∣vent and prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="91"/>For a more particular insight into the strength and subtilty of this <HI>Esau</HI>; we must consider it in the three main particular strengths of it, <HI>Its policy, priviledge, revenue.</HI> For the first, so it is, that the <HI>Popish Church</HI> in <HI>France</HI> is governed like those of the first and purer times, by <HI>Arch-bishops</HI> and <HI>Bi∣shops: Archibishops</HI> it comprehendeth twelve, and of <HI>Bishops</HI> an hundred and four. Of these the <HI>Me∣tropolitan</HI> is he of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> who useth to annoint the <HI>Kings,</HI> which office and preheminence hath been annexed to this seat, ever since the time of <HI>St. Re∣megius Bishop</HI> hereof, who converted <HI>Clovis King</HI> of the <HI>Franks</HI> unto the <HI>Gospel.</HI> The present <HI>Pri∣mate</HI> is Son to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Guise,</HI> by name <HI>Henry de Lorrein,</HI> of the age of fourteen yeares or thereabouts, a burden too unweildy for his shoul∣ders,
<Q><L>—Et quae non viribus istis</L>
<L>Munera conveniunt, nec tam puerilibus annis.</L></Q>
For the better government therefore of a charge so weighty, they have appointed him a <HI>Coadjutor</HI> to discharge that great function, till he come to age to take Orders. His name is <HI>Gifford,</HI> an <HI>English fugitive,</HI> said to be a man worthy of a great for∣tune, and able to bear it. The revenues of this <HI>Arch-bishoprick</HI> are somewhat of the meanest, not a∣mouting yearly to above 10000. Crowns, whereof Doctor <HI>Gifford</HI> receiveth onely two thousand, the remainder going to the <HI>Cadet</HI> of <HI>Lorreine.</HI> This trick the <HI>French</HI> learnt of the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> where the <HI>Princes,</HI> after the reformation began
<PB N="178" REF="92"/>
by <HI>Luther,</HI> took in the power and Lordships of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> which, together with their functions, they divided into two parts. The Lands they bestowed upon some of their younger Sons or Kinsmen, with the title of <HI>Administrator;</HI> the office and power of it they conferred with some annual pension on one of their Chaplains, whom they stiled the <HI>Su∣perintendent</HI> of the <HI>Bishoprick.</HI> This <HI>Archbishop,</HI> together with the rest of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> have under them their several <HI>Chancellors, Commissaries, Arch∣deacons</HI> and other Officers attending in their Courts, in which their power is not so general, as with us in <HI>England.</HI> Matters of <HI>Testament</HI> never trouble them, as belonging to the Court of Parlia∣ment, who also have wrested into their own hands almost all the business of importance, sure I am, all the causes of profit originally belonging to the Church. The affairs meerly <HI>Episcopal</HI> and <HI>Spiri∣tual</HI> are left unto them, as granting licence for mar∣riages, punishing whoredom by way of pennance, and the like: To go beyond this were <HI>Ʋltra cre∣pidam,</HI> and they should be sure to have a prohibi∣tion from the <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>Of their Priviledges, the chief of the <HI>Clergy∣men</HI> is, the little or no dependency they have on the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the little profits they pay unto their <HI>King.</HI> Of the <HI>Pope</HI> anon. To the <HI>King</HI> they pay onely their <HI>dismes</HI> or tithes according to the old rates, a small sum if compared unto the payments of their neighbours, it being thought, that the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> receiveth yearly one half of the Li∣ving of the Churches. But this I mean of their Livings onely, for otherwise they pay the usual ga∣bels
<PB N="179" REF="92"/>
and customs that are paid by the rest of the <HI>Kings Leige-people.</HI> In the general assembly of the three Estates, the <HI>Clergy</HI> hath authority to elect a set number of Commissioners to undertake for them &amp; the Church, w<SUP>ch</SUP> Commissioners do make up the the first of the three <HI>Estates,</HI> &amp; do first exhibite their greivances and petitions to the <HI>King.</HI> In a word, the <HI>French Church</HI> is the freest of any in Christen∣dom, that have not yet quitted their subjection to the <HI>Pope,</HI> as alwayes protesting against the <HI>Inquisi∣tion,</HI> not subjecting themselves to the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> and paying very little to his <HI>Holiness</HI> of that plentiful revenue wherewith <HI>God</HI> and good men have blessed it.</P>
<P>The number of those which the Church-land maintaineth in <HI>France</HI> is <HI>tantum non infinite,</HI> there∣fore the <HI>intrado</HI> and revenues of it must needs be uncountable. There are numbred in it (as we said before) twelve <HI>Archbishopricks,</HI> an hundred and four <HI>Bishopricks</HI>: To these add five hundred and fourty <HI>Archpriorities,</HI> one thousand four hundred and fifty <HI>Abbies</HI>; twelve thousand three hundred and twenty <HI>Priorities,</HI> the sixty seven <HI>Nunneries,</HI> seven hundred <HI>Covents</HI> of <HI>Friers,</HI> two hundred fifty nine <HI>Commendams</HI> of the Order of <HI>Malta,</HI> and one hundred and thirty thousand <HI>Parish Priests,</HI> yet this is not all. Their reckoning was made in the year 1598. since which time the <HI>Jesuits</HI> have di∣vers Colledges founded for them, and they are known to be none of the poorest. To maintain this large wilderness of men, the <HI>Statists</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who have proportioned the Country, do allow un∣to the <HI>Clergy</HI> almost a fourth part of the whole.
<PB N="180" REF="93"/>
For supposing <HI>France</HI> to contain two hundred millions of <HI>Arpens</HI> (a measure somewhat bigger than one Acre) they have allotted to the Church for its temporal revenue forty seven millions of them. In particular of the <HI>Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots,</HI> and Parish <HI>Priests,</HI> they of <HI>Aulx, Alby, Clumai,</HI> and <HI>St. Estiennes</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> are said to be the wealthiest. The <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Aux</HI> in <HI>Gascoyne</HI> is valued at 400000. liures, or 40000 <HI>li.</HI> English yearly. The <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Alby</HI> in <HI>Languedoc</HI> is prized at 100000. <HI>Florens,</HI> which is a fourth part of it, a great part of the revenue arising out of Saffron. The <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>Clumac</HI> in the <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Burgundy</HI> is said to be worth 50000 Crowns yearly, the pre∣sent <HI>Abbot</HI> being <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Lorreine, Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Rhemes</HI> and <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>St. Denis.</HI> The Parish <HI>Priest</HI> of <HI>St. Estiennes</HI> is judged to receive yearly no fewer than eight thousand Crowns, a good intra∣do. As for the vulgar Clergy, they have little tithe, and less glebe; most part of that Revenue being appropriated unto <HI>Abbies</HI> and other religious Houses. The greatest part of their meanes is the <HI>Baisemen,</HI> which is the Church offerings of the people at <HI>Christnings, Marriages, Burials, Dirges, Indulgences</HI> and the like, which is thought to a∣mount to almost as much as the temporal estate of the Church: An <HI>Income</HI> able to maintain them in good abundance, were it not for the greatness of their number. For reckoning that there are (as we have said) in <HI>France</HI> one hundred and thirty thousand Parish <HI>Priests,</HI> and that there are onely twenty seven thousand four hundred Parishes, it must of necessity be, that every Prrish, one with
<PB N="181" REF="93"/>
another, hath no fewer than four Priests, too many to be rich.</P>
<P>But this were one of the least injuries offered to the <HI>French,</HI> thrift, and would little hinder them from rising, if it were not, that the goodliest of their preferments are before their faces given unto Boyes and Children. An affront, which not onely despaireth them of the honours due unto their cal∣lings, but dishearteneth them in their studies, and by consequence draweth them to debauched and slanderous courses.

The Clergy therefore, <HI>Anno</HI> 1617. being assembled at the house of <HI>Austin Friers</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> (as every two years they use to do) being to take their leaves of the <HI>King,</HI> elected the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Aire</HI> to be their <HI>Spokesman,</HI> and to certifie his Majesty of their greivances. In performing which business, the principal thing of which he spake was to this pur∣pose. That whereas his Majesty was bound to give them <HI>Fathers,</HI> he gave them Children; that the name of <HI>Abbot</HI> signifieth a <HI>Father,</HI> and the fun∣ction of a <HI>Bishop</HI> was full of fatherly authority, yet <HI>Erance</HI> notwithstanding was now filled with <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> which are yet in their Nurses arms, or else under their Regents in Colledges. Nay more, that the abuse goeth before the being, Children being commonly designed to <HI>Bishopricks</HI> &amp; <HI>Abbacies</HI> before they were born. He also made another Complaint, that the Sovereign Courts by
<PB N="182" REF="94"/>
their decrees had attempted upon the authority which was committed to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> even in that which concerned meerly <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> discipline and government of the Church. To these Com∣plaints he gave them indeed a very gratious hear∣ing, but it never went further than a hearing, being never followed by redress. The Court of Parlia∣ment knew too well the strength of their own au∣thority, and the <HI>King</HI> was loath to take from him∣self those excellent advantages of binding to him∣self his Nobility, by the speedy preferring of their Children: And so the Clergy departed with a great deal of envy, and a little of satisfacti∣on.</P>
<P>Like enough it were, that the <HI>Pope</HI> would in part redress this injury, especially in the point of <HI>Juris∣diction,</HI> if he were able, but his wings are shrewdly clipped in this Country, neither can he flie at all, but as farre as they please to suffer him. For his temporal power, they never could be induced to ac∣knowledge it, as we see in their stories, <HI>Anno</HI> 1610. the <HI>Divines</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> in a Declaration of theirs tender'd to the <HI>Queen Mother,</HI> affirm the supre∣macy of the <HI>Pope</HI> to be an erroneus doctrine, and the ground of that hellish position of deposing and killing of <HI>Kings. Anno</HI> 1517. when the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Luteram</HI> had determined the <HI>Pope</HI> to be the Head of the <HI>Church</HI> in causes also temporal, the <HI>Ʋuniversity</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> testified against it, in an <HI>Apoligie</HI> of theirs dated the twelfth of <HI>March</HI> the same year. <HI>Leo decimus</HI> (saith the <HI>Apologie) in quidam coetu non tamen in spiritu Domini congrega∣to, contra fidem Catholicam &amp;c. sacrum Basiliense
<PB N="183" REF="94"/>
Concilium damnavit</HI>; In which Councill of <HI>Basill,</HI> the supremacy of the <HI>Pope</HI> was condemned. Nei∣ther did the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> forget to maintain their own authority: And therefore whereas <HI>Pope Boniface</HI> the eighth, had in a peremptory Letter Written to <HI>Phillip le Belle King</HI> of <HI>France</HI> stiled himself, <HI>Dominus totius Mundi tam in tem∣poralibus quam in spiritualibus</HI>: the <HI>King</HI> returned him an answer with an <HI>Epithite</HI> sutable to his ar∣rogancy: <HI>Sciat maxima tua fatuitas nos intempora∣libus alicui non subesse,</HI> &amp;c. The like answer though in modester termes, was sent to another of the <HI>Popes</HI> by <HI>St. Lewis</HI>; a man of a most mild and sweet disposition, yet unwilling to forgoe his Royalties.</P>
<P>His spiritual power is almost as little in sub∣stance, though more in shew; for whereas the <HI>Councill</HI> of <HI>Trent</HI> hath been an especiall authorizer of the <HI>Popes</HI> spiritual supremacy; the <HI>French</HI> Church never would receive it: by this means the <HI>Bishops</HI> keep in their hands their own full au∣thority, whereof an obedience to the decrees of that <HI>Councill</HI> would deprive them. It was truly said by <HI>St. Gregory,</HI> and they well knew it: Lib. 7. Epist. 70. <HI>Si unus universalis est, restat ut vos Episcopinon Sitis.</HI> Further the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> of <HI>Pa∣ris</HI> in their Declaration <HI>Anno</HI> 1610. above menti∣oned, plainly affirme that it is directly opposite to the doctrine of the Church, which the <HI>Ʋniver∣sity</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> hath alwaies maintained; that the <HI>Pope</HI> hath power of a Monarch in the spiritual Government of the Church. To look upon higher times, when the <HI>Councill</HI> of <HI>Constance</HI> had submit∣ted
<PB N="184" REF="95"/>
the authority of the <HI>Pope,</HI> unto that of a <HI>Councill. John Gerson Theologus Parisiensis magni nominis,</HI> defended that deeree, and entitleth them <HI>Perniciosos esse ad modum adulatores, qui tyranidem istam in Ecclesia invexere, quasi nullis Regum teneatur vinculis; quasi neque parere debeat Concilio Pontifex: nec ab eo judicare queat.</HI> The <HI>Kings</HI> themselves also befreind their <HI>Clergy</HI> in this Cause, and therefore not onely protested against the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent,</HI> wherein the spiritual tyranny was generally consented to by the <HI>Catholike</HI> facti∣on, but <HI>Henry</HI> the second also would not acknow∣ledge them to be a <HI>Council,</HI> calling them in his Let∣ters by no other name than <HI>Conventus Tridenti∣nus</HI>: An indignity which the, <HI>Fathers</HI> took very offensively.</P>
<P>Put the principal thing, in which it behooveth them not to acknowledge his spiritual supremacy is the Collation of <HI>Benefices</HI> and <HI>Bishopricks,</HI> and the <HI>Annates</HI> and first fruits thence arising. The first and greatest controversie between the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Christendom</HI> was about the bestow∣ing the Livings of the Church, and giving the in∣vestiture unto <HI>Bishops.</HI> The <HI>Popes</HI> had long thir∣sted after that authority, as being a great meanes to advance their followers, and establish their own greatness; for which cause, in divers petty <HI>Coun∣cels,</HI> the receiving of any <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> preferment of a <HI>Lay-man</HI> was decreed to be <HI>Simony.</HI> But this did little edifie with such patrons as had good Li∣vings: As soon as ever <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el brand,</HI> in the Cata∣logue of the <HI>Popes</HI> called <HI>Gregory</HI> the seventh, came to the throne of <HI>Rome,</HI> he set himself entirely to
<PB N="185" REF="95"/>
effect the business as well in <HI>Germany</HI> now he was <HI>Pope,</HI> as he had done in <HI>France</HI> whilst he was <HI>Le∣gate.</HI> He commandeth therefore <HI>Henry</HI> the third <HI>Emperour: Ne deinceps Episcopatus &amp; Beneficia</HI> (they are <HI>Platina</HI>'s own words) <HI>per cupiditatem Simoniacam committat, aliter se usurum in ipsum censuris Ecclesiasticis.</HI> To this injustice when the <HI>Emperour</HI> would not yeild, he called a solemn <HI>Council</HI> at the <HI>Lateran,</HI> where the <HI>Emperour</HI> was pronounced to be <HI>Simoniacal,</HI> and afterwards ex∣communicated: Neither would this <HI>Tyrant</HI> ever leave persecuting of him till he had laid him in his grave. After this followed great strugling between the <HI>Popes</HI> and the <HI>Emperours</HI> for this very matter; but in the end the <HI>Popes</HI> got the victory. In <HI>Eng∣land</HI> here, he that first bickered about it was <HI>Willi∣am Rufus,</HI> the controversie being, whether he or <HI>Pope Ʋrban</HI> should invest <HI>Anselme Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury. Anselme</HI> would receive his investiture of none but the <HI>Pope</HI>; whereupon the <HI>King</HI> ba∣nished him the Realm, into which he was not ad∣mitted till the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second. He to endear himself with his <HI>Clergy</HI> relinquished his right to the <HI>Pope</HI>; but afterwards repenting himself of it, he revoked his grant. Neither did the <HI>English Kings</HI> wholly loose it, till the raign of that unfor∣tunate Prince <HI>King John, Edward</HI> the first again recovered it, and his Successors kept it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Popes</HI> having with much violence and op∣position wrested into their hands this Priviledge, of nominating <HI>Priests</HI> and investing <HI>Bishops,</HI> they spared not to lay on what taxes they pleased; as on the <HI>Benefices, First fruits, Pensions, Subsidies,
<PB N="186" REF="96"/>
Fifteenths, Tenths</HI>; and on the <HI>Bishopricks,</HI> for <HI>Palls, Mitres, Crosiers, Rings,</HI> and I know not what bables. By these means the Churches were so impoverished; that upon complaint made unto the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Basel,</HI> all these cheating tricks, these <HI>aucupia &amp; eapilandi rationes,</HI> were abolished. This <HI>Decree</HI> was called <HI>Pragmatica sanctio,</HI> and was con∣firmed in <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the seventh, <HI>Anno</HI> 1438. An act of singular improvement to the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> which yearly be∣fore, as the Court of Parliament manifested to <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh had drained the State of a mil∣lion of Crowns. Since which time the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have sometimes omitted the vigour of the <HI>Sanction,</HI> and sometimes also exacted it, according as their affairs with the <HI>Pope</HI> stood: for which cause it was called, <HI>fraenum pontificum:</HI> At the last <HI>King Francis</HI> the first having conquered <HI>Millain,</HI> fell unto this composition with his <HI>Holiness,</HI> namely, that upon the falling of any <HI>Abbacie</HI> or <HI>Bishoprick</HI> the <HI>King</HI> should have six moneths time to present a fit man unto him, whom the <HI>Pope</HI> legally might invest: If the <HI>King</HI> neglected his time limited, the <HI>Pope</HI> might take the benefit of the relapse, and in∣stitute whom he pleased. So is it also with the in∣ferior benifices between the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Patrons</HI>; insomuch that any or every <HI>Lay-patron</HI> and <HI>Bishop</HI> together in <HI>England,</HI> hath for ought I see (at the least in this particular) as great a spiritual supremacy as the <HI>Pope</HI> in <HI>France,</HI></P>
<P>Nay to proceed further, and to shew how meer∣ly titular both his supremacies are, as well the <HI>spi∣ritual</HI> as the <HI>temporal,</HI> you may plainly see in the
<PB N="187" REF="96"/>
case of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> w<SUP>ch</SUP> was thus. In the year 1609. the <HI>Jesuites</HI> had obtained of <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth license to read again in their Colledge of <HI>Paris:</HI> but when their Letters Patents came to be verified in the Court of Parliament, the <HI>Rector</HI> and <HI>Ʋni∣versity</HI> opposed them. On the seventeenth of <HI>De∣cember, Anno</HI> 1611. both parties came to have an hearing; and the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> got the day, unless the <HI>Jesuits</HI> would subscribe unto these four points: <HI>Viz.</HI> First, that the <HI>Council</HI> was above the <HI>Pope.</HI> Secondly, that the <HI>Pope</HI> had not temporal power over <HI>Kings,</HI> and could not by Excommunication deprive them of their Realms and Estates. Third∣ly, that Clergy men having heard of any attempt or conspiracy against the King, or his Realm, or any matter of treason in Confession, they were bound to reveal it. And fourthly, that Clergy men were subject to the <HI>Secular Prince,</HI> or <HI>Politick Magi∣strate.</HI> It appeared by our former discourse, what title, or no power, they had left the <HI>Pope</HI> over the estates and preferments of the <HI>French.</HI> By these propositions (to which the <HI>Jusuits</HI> in the end subscribed, I know not with what mental reservation) it is more than evident, that they have left him no command, neither over their con∣sciences nor their persons. So that all things con∣sidered, we may justly say of the Papal power in <HI>France,</HI> what the <HI>Papists</HI> falsly say of <HI>Erasmus,</HI> namely, that it is <HI>Nomen sine rebus.</HI></P>
<P>In one thing onely his authority here is entire, which is his immediate protection of all the Or∣ders of <HI>Friers,</HI> and also a <HI>superintendency</HI> or supreme eye over the <HI>Monks,</HI> who acknowledge very small
<PB N="188" REF="97"/>
obedience, if any at all, to the <HI>French Bishops.</HI> For though at the beginning every part and member of the <HI>Diocess</HI> was directly under the care and com∣mand of the <HI>Bishop</HI>; yet it so happened at the buil∣ding of <HI>Monestaries</HI> in the <HI>Western Church,</HI> the <HI>Abbots</HI> being men of good parts and sincere life, grew much into the envy of their <HI>Diocesan.</HI> For which cause, as also to be more at their own com∣mand, they made suit to the <HI>Pope,</HI> that they might be freed from that subjection: <HI>Ʋtque intutelam Dive Petri admitterentur.</HI> A proposition very plausible to his <HI>Holiness</HI> ambition, which by this meanes might the sooner be raised to his height, and there∣fore without difficulty granted: This gap opened, first the several Orders of <HI>Friers,</HI> and after them the <HI>Deans</HI> and <HI>Chapters</HI> purchased to themselves the like exemptions. In this the <HI>Popes</HI> power was wonderfully strengthened, in having such able and so many props to uphold his authority; it being a true <HI>Maxime</HI> in State, <HI>Quod qui privilegia obtenent, ad eadem conservanda, teneantur authoritatem conce∣dentis tueri.</HI> This continued till the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent</HI> unquestioned, where the <HI>Bishops</HI> much com∣plained of their want of authority, and imputed all the schismes and vices in the Church to this, that their hands were tied. Hereupon the <HI>Popes Legates</HI> thought it fit to restore to their jurisdicti∣on their <HI>Deans</HI> and <HI>Chapters:</HI> At that of the <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Monestaries</HI> they were more sticking: till at the last <HI>Sebastian Pighinus</HI> one of the <HI>Popes</HI> Officers found out for them this satisfaction, that they should have an eye and inspection into the lives of the <HI>Monks,</HI> not by any authority of their
<PB N="189" REF="97"/>
own, <HI>Sed tanquam a sede Apostolica delegati.</HI> But as for the Orders of <HI>Friers,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> would not by any means give way unto it. They are his <HI>Jani∣zaries,</HI> and the strongest bulwarks of his Empire, and are therefore called in a good Author, <HI>Egre∣gia Romanae Curiae instrumenta.</HI> So that with them the <HI>Diocesan</HI> hath nothing to do; each severall religious House being as a Court of <HI>Peculiars,</HI> subject onely to the great Metropolitan of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>This near dependance on his <HI>Holiness</HI> maketh this generation a great deal more regardless of their behaviour than otherwise it would be, though since the growth of the reformation, shame and fear hath much reformed them. They have still how∣soever a spice of their former wantonness, and on occasions will permit themselves a little good fel∣lowship. And to say truth of them, I think them to be the best Companions in <HI>France</HI> for a journey, but not for acquaintance. They live very merrily, and keep a competent table, more I suppose than can stand with their vow, and yet far short of that affluency whereof many of our books accuse them. It was my chance to be in an house of the <HI>Francis∣cans</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> where one of the <HI>Friers,</HI> upon the en∣treaty of our Friend, had us into the Hall, it being then the time of their Refectory, a favour not vul∣gar. There saw we the Brothers sitting all on a side, and every one a pretty distance from the o∣ther; their several commons being a dish of pot∣tage, a chop of mutton, a dish of Cherries, and a large glass of water. This provision, together with a liberal allowance of ease, and a little of stu∣dy,
<PB N="190" REF="98"/>
keepeth them exceeding plump and in good liking, and maketh them, having little to take thought for, maketh them (as I said before) pas∣sing good Company. As I travelled to <HI>Orleans</HI> we had in coach with us three of these mortified sinners; two of the Order of <HI>St. Austin,</HI> and one <HI>Francis∣can,</HI> the merriest Crickets that ever chirped. No∣thing in them but mad tricks and complements, and for musick they would sing like Hawks; when we came to a vein of good Wine, they would chear up themselves and their neighbour with this comfortable doctrine, <HI>Vivamus ut bibamus, et bi∣bamus ut vivamus</HI>: and for Courtship, and toy∣ing with the <HI>Wenches,</HI> you would easily beleeve it had been a trade, with which they had not a little been acquainted. Of all men when I am married God keep my wife from them, and till then my neighbours.</P>
<P>On the other side the common Priests of <HI>France</HI> are so dull and blockish, that you shall hardly meet with a more contemptible people. The meanest of our <HI>Curats</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for spirit and discourse are very <HI>Popes</HI> to them: for learning they may safely say with <HI>Socrates, Hoc tantum sci∣mus, quod nescimus</HI>: but you must not look that they should say it in Latine. Tongues they have none but those of their <HI>Mother</HI> and the <HI>Masse Book</HI>; of which last they can make no use▪ unless the Book be open, and then also the Book is fain to read it self: for in the last <HI>Romanum Missale,</HI> established by the authority of <HI>Pius</HI> the fifth, and recognized by <HI>Clement</HI> the eighth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1600.
<PB N="191" REF="98"/>
every sillable is diversly marked, whether it must be sounded long or short; just as the varifying examples are in the end of the <HI>English Grammer.</HI> When I had lost my self in the streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> and wanted <HI>French</HI> to enquire homeward, I used to apply my self to some of this reverend habit: But <HI>O soeclum insipiens et infacitum</HI>; you might as easi∣ly have wrought water out of the flint, as a word of <HI>Latine</HI> out of their mouthes. Nor is this the disease of the vulgar <HI>Masse mumbler</HI> onely, it hath also infected the right worshipful of the Clergy:</P>
<P>In <HI>Orleans</HI> I had business with a <HI>Chanoin</HI> of the Church of <HI>St. Croiz,</HI> a fellow that wore his sur∣plice (it was made of Lawne and Lace) with as good a credit as ever I saw any; and for the com∣liness and capacity of his cap, he might have been a <HI>Metropolitan</HI>: perceiving me to speak to him in a strange Tongue (for it was <HI>Latine</HI>) he very learnedly asked me this question; <HI>Num potestis loqui Gallica</HI>? which when I had denied, at last he brake out into another Interrogatory: <HI>viz. Quandiu fuistis in Gallice.</HI> To conclude having read over my Letter, with two or three deadly pangs, and six times rubbing of his temples, he dismissed me with this cordial; and truly it was very comfortable to my humor. <HI>Ego necotias vestras curabo.</HI> A strange beast and one of the greatest prodigies of Ignorance, that ever I met with in mans apparrel.</P>
<P>Such being the <HI>Romish Priests,</HI> it is no marvail if the <HI>French</HI> be no more setled and resolute in their Religion. If the eye be blind, the body cannot chuse but be darkned: and certainly there
<PB N="192" REF="99"/>
is nothing that hath prepared many of this Realm more to embrace the reformation, than this block∣ishness of their own Clergy: an excellent ad∣vantage to the <HI>Protestant Ministers,</HI> could they but well humor it; and likely to be a fair inlarge∣ment to their party, if well husbanded. Besides this the <HI>French Catholicks</HI> are not over earnest in their cause, and so do lye open to the assaults of any politick enemy; to deal with them by main force of argument, and in the servent spirit of zeal (as the <HI>Protestants</HI> too often do) is not the way: Men uncapable of opposition (as this people generally are) and furious, if once thwar∣ted, must be tamed as <HI>Alexander</HI> did his Horse <HI>Bucephalus.</HI> Those that came to back him with the tyranny of the spur and a cudgel, he quickly threw down, and mischieved; <HI>Alexander</HI> came otherwise prepared, for turning his Horse toward the Sun, that he might not see the impatiency of his shadow, he spake kindly to him, and gently clapping him on the back, till he had left his flinging and wildness, he lightly leapeth into the saddle, the Horse never making resistance. <HI>Plu∣tarch</HI> in his life relateth the storie, and this the <HI>Morall</HI> of it.</P>

himself very favorable to the <HI>French</HI> side, well knowing into what perils a necessary and impoli∣tick dependance on the <HI>Spanish</HI> party onely, would one day bring the state <HI>Ecclesiastick.</HI> As in the general, so in many particulars also, hath he ex∣pressed much affection unto him: as first by ta∣king into his hand the <HI>Valtolin,</HI> till his Son of <HI>France</HI> might settle himself in some course to reco∣ver it: secondly, his not stirring in the behalf of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> during the last warrs in <HI>Italy</HI>; and thirdly, his speedy and willing grant of the dispen∣sation of <HI>Madames</HI> marriage, of which his <HI>Papacy</HI> was so large an <HI>Omen,</HI> so fair a <HI>Prognostick.</HI>

The <HI>Lar,</HI> or <HI>Angel Guardian</HI> of his thoughts ha∣stened him in it, in whose time there was so plausi∣ble a presage, that it must be accomplished. For thus it standeth: <HI>Malachy</HI> now a <HI>Saint,</HI> then one of the first <HI>Apostles</HI> of the <HI>Irish,</HI> one much reveren∣ced in his memory to this day by that Nation, left behind him by way of prophesie a certain number of <HI>Motto's</HI> in <HI>Latine,</HI> telling those, that there should follow that certain number of <HI>Popes</HI> onely, whose conditions successively should be hereby expressed in those <HI>Motto's,</HI> according to that order he had, placed them in. <HI>Messingham</HI> an Irish Priest, &amp; Master of the Colledge of Irish fugitives in <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> hath collected together the lives of all the <HI>Irish Saints,</HI> which book himself shewed me. In that volume, and the life of that <HI>Saint,</HI> are the several <HI>Motto's,</HI> and the several <HI>Popes,</HI> set down colume∣wise
<PB N="195" REF="100"/>
one against the other. I compared the lives of them with the <HI>Motto's,</HI> as farre as my memory would carry me, and found many of them very answerable: as I remember there are thirty six <HI>Motto's</HI> yet to come, and when just as many <HI>Popes</HI> are joyned to them, they are of opinion (for so <HI>Malachy</HI> foretold) that either the world should end, or the <HI>Popedom</HI> be ruined. Amongst others, the <HI>Motto</HI> of the present <HI>Pope</HI> is most remarkable, and sutable to the cheif action likely to happen in his time, being this [<HI>Lilium &amp; Rosa</HI>] which they interpret, and in my mind not unhappily, to be in∣tended to the conjunction of the <HI>French Lillie</HI> and the <HI>English Rose.</HI> To take from me any suspition of imposture, he shewed me an old book, printed almost two hundred years ago, written by one <HI>Wi∣on</HI> a <HI>Flemming,</HI> and comparing the number of the <HI>Motto's</HI> with the Catalogue of the <HI>Popes,</HI> I found the name of <HI>Ʋrban</HI> (now <HI>Pope</HI>) directly to answer it: upon this ground an <HI>English Catholike,</HI> whose acquaintance I gained in <HI>France,</HI> made a Copy of Verses in French, and presented them to the <HI>Eng∣lish Embassadors,</HI> the <HI>Earles of Carlisle</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>: because he is my Friend, and the conceit is not to be despised, I begged them of him, and these are they.

With these verses I take my leave of his <HI>Holiness,</HI> wishing none of his successors would presage worse luck unto <HI>England</HI>: I go now to see his <HI>Nuntio,</HI> to whose house the same <HI>English Catholike</HI> brought me, but he was not at home, his name is <HI>Ferdinando d' Espado</HI>; a man (as he informed me) able to discharge the trust reposed in him by his Master, and one that very well affecteth the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Nation He hath the fairest <HI>Eglise,</HI> and keepeth the largest retinue of any ordinary <HI>Embassadour</HI> in the Realm, and maketh good his Masters suprema∣cy by his own precedency. To honour him, against he was to take this charge, his Holiness created him <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Damiata</HI> in <HI>Egypt.</HI> A place, which I am certain never any of them saw but in a <HI>Map</HI>; and for the profits he receiveth thence, they will
<PB N="197" REF="101"/>
never be able to pay for his <HI>Crosier.</HI> But this is one of his <HI>Holiness</HI> usual policies, to satisfie his fol∣lowers with empty titles. So he made <HI>Bishop</HI> whom he sent to govern for him in <HI>England</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> in <HI>Asia</HI>: and <HI>Smith</HI> also, who is come over about the same business with the <HI>Queen, Bishop of Archidala</HI> a City of <HI>Thrace.</HI> An old <HI>English Doctor</HI> used it as an especial argument, to prove the Universality of power in the <HI>Pope,</HI> be∣cause he could ordain <HI>Bishops</HI> over all Cities in <HI>Christendom.</HI> If he could as easily also give them the revenue; this reason I confess would much sway me, till then I am sorry, that men should still be boyes and play with bubbles: By the same au∣thority he might do well, to make all his Courtiers <HI>Kings,</HI> and he were sure to have a most Royal and beggerly <HI>Court</HI> of it.</P>
<P>To proceed a little further in the <HI>Allegory</HI>: so it is, that when <HI>Jacob</HI> saw <HI>Esau</HI> to have incurred his Fathers and Mothers anger, for his heathenish marriage; he set himself to bereave his elder bro∣ther of his blessing: prayers and the sweet smell of his Venison, the sweet smelling of his sacrifices obtained of his <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Father</HI> a blessing for him, for indeed the <HI>Lord</HI> hath given unto this his <HI>French Jacob,</HI> as it is in the <HI>Text: The dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and Wine</HI> Gen. 27. 5, 28. It followeth in the 41. ver. of the chap∣ter: <HI>And</HI> Esau <HI>hated</HI> Jacob, <HI>because of the blessing wherewith his Father had blessed him: and</HI> Esau <HI>said in his heart, the dayes of mourning for my Father are at hand, then will I slay my brother</HI> Jacob: The e∣vent of which his bloudy resolution was, that <HI>Jacob</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="102"/>
was fain to relinquish all that he had and fly unto his <HI>Ʋncle.</HI> This last story expresseth very much of the estate of the <HI>French</HI> Church. The <HI>Papists</HI> ha∣ted the <HI>Protestants</HI> to see them thrive and encrease so much amongst them; this hatred moved them to a war, by which they hoped to root them out all together; and this war compelled the <HI>Protestants</HI> to abandon their good Towns, and strong Holds, and all their possessions, and to fly unto their friends wheresoever they could find them. And indeed the present estate of the <HI>Protestants</HI> is not much better than that of <HI>Jacob</HI> in <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> nor much different; the blessing which they ex∣pect, lyeth more in the seed than in the harvest, and well may they hope to be restored to the love and bosome of their brethren, of which as yet they have no assurance: For their strength it consisteth principally in their <HI>prayers to God</HI>; and secondly, in their obedience to their <HI>King</HI>: Within these two Fortresses, if they can keep themselves, they need fear none ill, because they shall deserve none. The onely outward strengths they have left them, are the two Towns of <HI>Moutabon</HI> and <HI>Rochell</HI>; the one deemed invincible, the other threatned a spee∣dy destruction. The <HI>Duke of Espernon</HI> (at my being there) lay round about it, and it was said, that the Town was in very bad terms; all the neigh∣bouring Townes, to whose opposition they most trusted, having yeilded at the first sight of the Ca∣non. <HI>Rochell</HI> its thought cannot be forced by as∣saults, nor compelled by a famine; some <HI>Protestants</HI> are glad of it, and hope to see the <HI>French</HI> Church restored to its former powerableness, by the resist∣ance
<PB N="199" REF="102"/>
of that Town meerly: I rather think, that the perverse and stubborn condition of it will at last drive the young <HI>King</HI> into a fury, and incite him to revenge their contradiction on their innocent Friends, now disarmed and disabled. Then will they see at last the issue of their own peremptory resolutions, and begin to beleive, that the Heathen <HI>Historian</HI> was of the two the better <HI>Christian,</HI> when he gave us this note. <HI>Non turpe est ab eo vinci, quem vincere esset nefas, neque illi, in honeste etiam sum∣mitti, quem fortuna super omnes extulisset.</HI></P>
<P>This weakness and misery which hath now be∣fallen the <HI>Protestants,</HI> was an effect, I confess, of the ill will which the other party bare them; but that they bare them ill will, was a fruit of their own grafting. In this circumstance they were nothing like <HI>Jacob,</HI> who in the hatred, which his brother <HI>Esau</HI> had to him, was meerly passive. They being active also in the birth of it. And indeed the lamentable and bloudy war which fell upon them, they not onely endeavoured not to avoid, but in∣vited. During the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, who would not see it, and the troublesome minority of <HI>Lewis</HI> the thirteenth. who could not molest them, they had made themselves masters of ninety nine Towns, well fortified and enabled for a siege. A strength too great for any one faction to keep to∣ther under a <HI>King</HI> which desires to be himself and so rule his people. In the opinion of their potency they call Assemblies, Parliaments, as it were, when and as often as they pleased. There they consulted of the common affairs of Religion, made new Laws of government, removed and exchanged their ge∣neral
<PB N="200" REF="103"/>
Officers, the <HI>Kings</HI> leave all this while never so much as formally asked. Had they onely been guilty of too much power, that crime alone had been sufficient to have raised a war against them, it not standing with the safety and honour of a <HI>King,</HI> not to be the absolute commander of his own subjects. But in this their licentious calling of Assemblies, they abused their power into a neg∣lect, and in not dissolving them at his Majesties commandement, they increased their neglect into a disobedience. The Assembly which principally the war and their ruine, was that of <HI>Rochell,</HI> called by the <HI>Protestants</HI> presently upon the <HI>Kings</HI> journey into <HI>Bearne.</HI> This general meeting the <HI>King</HI> pro∣hibited by his especial Edicts: declaring all them to be guilty of treason, which notwithstanding, they would not hearken to, but very undutifully went on in their purposes: It was said by a Gen∣tleman of that party, and one that had been em∣ployed in many of their affairs, that the very zeal of some who had the guiding of their consciences, had thrusted them into those desperate courses, and I beleive him.</P>
<Q>Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum.</Q>
<P>Being assembled, they sent the <HI>King</HI> a Remon∣strance of their greivances, to which the <HI>Duke Les∣diguiers,</HI> in a letter to them written, gives them a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e y fair and plausible answer, wherein also he en∣treateth them to obey the <HI>Kings</HI> Edict, and break off the Assembly: Upon the receit of this Letter those of the Assembly published a Declaration,
<PB N="201" REF="103"/>
wherein they verified the meeting to be lawful; and their purpose not to dismiss themselves till their desires were granted. This affront done to the <HI>King,</HI> made him gather together his forces; yet at the <HI>Duke of Lesdiguiers</HI> request, he allowed them twenty four dayes respite before his Armies should march towards them. He offered them also very fair and reasonable conditions, such al∣most as their <HI>Deputies</HI> had sollicited, but far better than those which they were glad to accept, when all their Towns were taken from them. <HI>Profect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meluctabilis fatorum vis, cujus fortunam mutare constituit, ejus corrumpit consilia:</HI> It holds very rightly in this people, who turned a deaf ear to all good advise, and were resolved, it seemeth, not to hear the voice of the charmer, charmed he never so sweetly. In their Assembly therefore they make Laws and Orders to regulate their disobedience; as that no peace should be made without the con∣sent of the general Convocation, about paying of the Souldiers wages, for the detaining of the Re∣venues of the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and the like. They also have divided <HI>France</HI> into seven circles or parts, assigning over every circle several Gene∣rals and Lieutenants, and prescribed Orders how those Generals should proceed in the warr.</P>
<P>Thus we see the <HI>Kings</HI> Army levied upon no sleight grounds. His regal authority was neglected, his especial Edicts violated, his gratious proffers slighted, his revenues forbidden him, and his Realm divided before his face, and alotted unto Officers not of his own election. Had the prosecution of his
<PB N="202" REF="104"/>
action been as fair as the cause was just and legal, the <HI>Protestants</HI> onely had deserved the infamy: But <HI>hinc illae lachrymae,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> so behaved himself in it, that he suffered the sword to walk at randome, as if his main design had been, not to correct his peo∣ple, but to ruine them. I will instance onely in the tyrannical slaughter which he permitted at the taking of <HI>Nigrepelisse</HI> a Town of <HI>Queren,</HI> where indeed the Souldiers shewed the very rigor of se∣verity, which either a barbarous Victor could in∣flict, or a vanquished people suffer. <HI>Nec ullum saevitiae genus omisit ira &amp; Victoria:</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the angred <HI>Romans</HI>: For they spared neither man, nor woman, nor child, all equally subject to the cruelty of the Sword and the Conqueror: the streets paved with dead carcasses, the channels run∣ning with the bloud of Christians: no noise in the streets, but of such as were welcoming death, or suing for life. The Churches, which the <HI>Gothes</HI> spared in the sack of <HI>Rome,</HI> were at this place made the <HI>Theaters</HI> of <HI>lust and bloud</HI>; neither priviledge of Sanctuary, nor fear of <HI>God,</HI> in whose House they were, qualifying their outrage. Thus in the Com∣mon places.
<Q><L>At domus interior gemitu miseroque tumultu</L>
<L>Miscetur: Penitus{que} eavae clangoribus aedes</L>
<L>Faeminiis ululant —</L>
<L>As <HI>Virgill</HI> in the ruine of <HI>Troy.</HI></L></Q>
But the calamities which befel the men were mer∣ciful and sparing, if compared with those which the women suffered: when the Souldiers had made
<PB N="203" REF="104"/>
them the Subjects of their lust, they made them after the subjects of their fury; in that onely pit∣tiful to that poor and distressed Sex, that they did not let them survive their honours. Such of them, who out of fear and faintness had made but little resistance, had the favour to be stabbed; but those, whose virtue and courage maintained their bodies valiantly from the rape of those villains, had the secrets of Nature (<HI>Procul hinc este cast ae misericor∣des aures</HI>) filled with Gun-powder, and so blown into ashes. Whether, O <HI>Ye Divine Powers,</HI> is hu∣manity fled, when it is not to be found in Christi∣ans? or where shall we find the effects of a pitti∣ful nature, when men are become so unnatural? It is said, that the <HI>King</HI> was ignorant of this barba∣rousness, and offended at it: Offended, I perswade my self, he could not but be, unless he had totally put off himself and degenerated into a <HI>Tyger</HI>: but for his ignorance, I dare not conceive it to be any other than that of <HI>Nero,</HI> an ignorance rather in his eye than in his understanding. <HI>Subduxit oculos Nero</HI> (saith <HI>Tacitus) jussitque scelera, non spectavit.</HI></P>
<P>Though the <HI>Protestants</HI> deserved affliction for their disobedience, yet this was an execution above the nature of a punishment, a misery beyond the condition of the crime. True it is, and I shall ne∣ver acquit them of it, that in the time of their pros∣perity they had done the <HI>King</HI> many affronts, and committed many acts of disobedience and inso∣lency, which justly occasioned the warr against them. For besides those already recited, they themselves first brake those <HI>Edicts,</HI> the due execu∣tion
<PB N="204" REF="105"/>
whereof seemed to have been their onely petition. The <HI>King</HI> by his <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>Pacification</HI> had licensed the free exercise of both Religions, and thereupon permitted the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Jesuites</HI> to preach in the Towns of <HI>Caution,</HI> being then in the hands of the <HI>Protestants.</HI> On the other side, the <HI>Protestants</HI> assembled at <HI>Loudan,</HI> straitly comman∣ded all their Governours, Mayors, and Sheriffs, not to suffer any <HI>Jesuits,</HI> or any of any other Order, to preach in their Towns, although licensed by the <HI>Bishop</HI> of the <HI>Diocess:</HI> When upon dislike of their proceedings in that Assembly, the <HI>King</HI> had declared their meetings to be unlawful, and con∣trary to his peace, and this Declaration was verifi∣ed against them by the Parliament; they notwith∣standing would not separate themselves, but stood still upon terms of capitulation, and the justifia∣bleness of their action. Again, whereas it hap∣pened that the <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Privas,</HI> Town full of those of the Religion, dyed in the year 1620. and left his Daughter and Heir in the bed and marriage of the <HI>Viscount</HI> of <HI>Cheylane</HI> a Catholike; this new Lord, according to law and right, in his own Town changed the former Garrison, putting his own servants and dependants in their places. Upon this the <HI>Protestants</HI> of the Town and Country about it, draw themselves in Troops, surprize many of the Towns about it, and at the last compelled the young Gentleman to fly from his inheritance; an action which jumping even with the time of the Assembly at <HI>Rochell,</HI> made the <HI>King</HI> more doubtful of their sincerity. I could add to these divers others of their undutiful practises, being the
<PB N="205" REF="105"/>
effects of too much felicity, and of a fortune which they could not govern. <HI>Atqui animus meminisse horret, luctu{que} refuget.</HI></P>
<P>These their insolencies and unruly acts of diso∣bedience made the <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Council</HI> suspect that their designs tended further than Religion; and that their purpose might be to make them∣selves a free Estate, after the example of <HI>Geneva</HI> and the <HI>Low Country-men.</HI> The late power which they had taken of calling their own <HI>Synods</HI> and <HI>Convocations,</HI> was a strong argument of their pur∣pose: so also was the intelligence which they held with those of their faith at the <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Sappe,</HI> cal∣led by the permission of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth on the first of <HI>October, Anno</HI> 1603. They not onely gave audience to Ambassadours, and received Letters from forrain Princes, but also importuned his Ma∣jesty to have a general liberty of going into any other Countreys, and assigning at their Counsel a matter of especial importance. And therefore the <HI>King</HI> upon a foresight of the dangers, wisely pro∣hibited them to go to any Assemblies without a particular licence, upon pain to be declared Tray∣tors. Since that time growing into greater strength, whensoever they had occasion of busi∣ness with <HI>King Lewis,</HI> they would never treat with him but by their <HI>Embassadors,</HI> and upon especial Articles. An ambition above the quality of those that profess themselves <HI>Sorbonets,</HI> and the onely way, as <HI>Du Seirres</HI> noteth, to make an estate in the <HI>State</HI>: but the answers made unto the <HI>King</HI> by those of <HI>Alerack</HI> and <HI>Montanbon</HI> are pregnant proofs of their intent and meaning in this kind.
<PB N="206" REF="106"/>
The first, being summoned by the <HI>King</HI> and his Army the 22. of <HI>July, Anno</HI> 1621. returned thus, that the <HI>King</HI> should suffer them to enjoy their liberties, and leave their fortifications as they were for them of their lives, and so they would declare themselves to be his subjects. They of <HI>Montan∣bon</HI> made a fuller expression of the general design <HI>Disobedience</HI>; which was, that they were resolved to live and die in the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> of the Churches: had they said, for the <HI>Service</HI> of the <HI>King,</HI> it had been spoken bravely, but now rebelliously.</P>
<P>This union and confederacy of theirs <HI>King Lewis</HI> used to call, <HI>the Common-wealth of Rochell</HI>; for the overthrow of which he alwayes protested that he had onely taken Arms: and if we compare circumstances, we shall find it to be no other. In the second of <HI>April,</HI> before he had as yet advanced into the Feild, he published a <HI>Declaration</HI> in favour of all those of the Religion, which would contain themselves within duty and obedience. And whereas some of <HI>Tours</HI> at the beginning of the warrs had tumultuously molested the <HI>Protestants</HI> at the burial of one of their dead, five of them by the <HI>Kings</HI> especial commandement were openly executed: When the warr was hottest abroad, those of the <HI>Gospel</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI> lived as securely as ever, and had their accustomed meetings at <HI>Cha∣rentan.</HI> So had those also of other places. More∣over when tidings came to <HI>Paris</HI> of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Mayens</HI> death slain before <HI>Montanbon,</HI> the <HI>Rascal French,</HI> according to their hot headed dispositions, breathed out nothing but ruine to the <HI>Hugonots</HI>; the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Montbazon,</HI> Governour of the City,
<PB N="207" REF="106"/>
commanded their houses and the streets to be safely guarded. After when this Rabble had burnt down their Temple at <HI>Charentan,</HI> the Court of <HI>Parliament</HI> on the day following ordained, that it should be built up again in a more beautiful man∣ner, and that at the <HI>Kings</HI> charge. Add to this, that since the ending of the warrs, and the reducti∣on of almost all their Towns, we have not seen the least alteration of Religion. Besides that, they have been permitted to hold a National <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Clarenton</HI> for establishing the truth of their do∣ctrine, against the errors of <HI>Arminius</HI> Professor of <HI>Leiden</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>All things thus considered in their true being, I cannot see for what cause our late Soveraign should suffer so much envy as he did, for not gi∣ving them assistance. I cannot but say, that my self hath too often condemned his remissness in that cause, which upon better consideration I can∣not tell how he should have dealt in. Had he been a meddler in it further than he was, he had not so much preserved Religion as supported rebellion; besides the consequence of the example. To have assisted the disobedient <HI>French,</HI> under the colour of the liberty of Conscience, had been onely to have taught that <HI>King</HI> a way into <HI>England</HI> upon the same pretence, and to have troad the path of his own hazard. Further, he had not long before denyed succor to his own children, when he might have given upon a better ground, and for a fairer purpose; and could not now in honour counte∣nance the like action in another: For that other denial of his helping hand, I much doubt how farre
<PB N="208" REF="107"/>
posterity will acquit him, though certainly he was a good Prince, and had been an happy instrument of the peace of <HI>Christendom,</HI> had not the later part of his raign happened in a time so full of troubles. So that betwixt the quietness of his nature, and the turbulencies of his later dayes, he fell into that mi∣serable exigent mentioned in the <HI>Historian: Miser∣rimum est cum alicui aut natura sua excedenda est, aut minuenda dignitas.</HI> Add to this, that the <HI>French</HI> had first been abandoned at home by their own friends: of seven Generals, whom they had ap∣pointed for the seven circles into which they divi∣ded all <HI>France,</HI> four of them never giving them incouragement. The three which accepted of those inordinate Governments, were the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Rohan</HI> his Brother Mr. <HI>Sonbise,</HI> and the <HI>Marquess la Force</HI>: the four others being the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Tre∣moville,</HI> the <HI>Earl of Chastillon,</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Lesdi∣guier,</HI> and the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Bovillon,</HI> who should have commanded in cheif: So that the <HI>French Prote∣stants</HI> cannot say, that he was first wanting unto them, but they to themselves. If we demand what should move the <HI>French Protestants</HI> to this rebel∣lious contradiction of his Majesties commande∣ments, we must answer, that it was too much happi∣ness: <HI>Causa hujus belli eadem, quae omnium nimid faelicitas</HI>: as <HI>Florus</HI> of the Civil warrs between <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey.</HI> Before the year 1620. when they fell first into the <HI>Kings</HI> dis-favour, they were possessed of almost an hundred good Towns well fortified for their safety, besides beautiful houses and ample possessions in the Villages. They slept every man under his own Vine, and his own Fig-tree,
<PB N="209" REF="107"/>
neither fearing nor needing to fear the least disturbance with those of the Catholike party; they were grown so intimate and entire by reason of their inter-marriages, that a very few years would have made them incorporated, if not into one faith, yet into one family: For their better satisfaction in matters of Justice, it pleased <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth to erect a chamber in the Court of <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> purposely for them. It consisted of one <HI>President</HI> and sixteen <HI>Counsellors</HI>; their office, to take knowledge of all the Causes and Suits of them of the Reformed Religion, as well within the jurisdiction of the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> as also in <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>Brittain,</HI> till there should be a Chamber erected in either of them. There were appointed also two Chambers in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> and <HI>Grenoble,</HI> and one at <HI>Chasters</HI> for the <HI>Parliament</HI> at <HI>Tholoza.</HI> These Chambers were called, <HI>Les Chambres de l' Edict,</HI> because they were established by a special <HI>Edict</HI> at the Town of <HI>Nantes</HI> in <HI>Brittain, April</HI> the eighth; <HI>Anno</HI> 1598. In a word, they lived so secure and happy, that one would have thought their felicities had been immortal.

And yet they are not brought so low, but that they may live happily, if they can be content to live obediently, that which is taken from them be∣ing matter of strength onely, not privi∣ledge.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="108"/>Let us now look upon them in their Churches; which we shall find as empty of magnificence as ceremony: to talk amongst them of Common prayers, were to fright them with a second coming of the <HI>Mass:</HI> and to mention Prayers at the bu∣rial of the dead, were to perswade them of a <HI>Pur∣gatory.</HI> Painted glass in a Church window is ac∣counted for the flag and ensign of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and for <HI>Organs,</HI> no question, but they are deemed the <HI>Devils Bap pipes:</HI> Shew them a Surplice, and they cry out, a rag of the <HI>Whore</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> yet a Sheet upon a Woman when she is in child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bed is a grea∣ter abomination than the other: A strange people, that could never think the <HI>Mass-book</HI> sufficiently reformed, till they had taken away <HI>Prayers,</HI> nor that their Churches could ever be handsome until they were ragged. This foolish opposition of their first Reformers hath drawn the <HI>Protestants</HI> of these parts into a world of dislike and envy, and been no small disadvantage to their side, whereas the Church of <HI>England,</HI> though it dissent as much from the <HI>Papists</HI> in point of doctrine, is yet not uncharitably thought on by the moderatest Ca∣tholikes, by reason it retained such an excellency of discipline. When the <HI>Liturgie</HI> of our Church was translated into <HI>Latine</HI> by <HI>Doctor Mocket</HI> once <HI>Warden of All-Souls Colledge in Oxford,</HI> it was with great approof and applause received here in <HI>France</HI> by those whom they call <HI>Catholikes Royal,</HI> as marvelling to see such order and regular devo∣tion in them, whom they were taught to condemn for heretical An allowance which with some little help might have been raised higher, from the pra∣ctise
<PB N="211" REF="108"/>
of our Church, to some points of our judge∣ment. And it is very worthy of our observation, that which the <HI>Marquess</HI> of <HI>Rhosney</HI> spake of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> when he came as extraordinary <HI>Embassa∣dour</HI> from <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth to welcome <HI>King James</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> for upon the view of our solemn Service and Ceremonies he openly said unto his fellows, that if the reformed Church∣es in <HI>France</HI> had kept the same orders amongst them which we have, he was assured, that there would have been many thousands more of <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> than now there are. But the <HI>Marquess</HI> of <HI>Rhosney</HI> was not the last that said so: I have heard divers <HI>French Papists,</HI> who were here at the <HI>Queens</HI> coming over, and ventured so far upon an excom∣munication, as to be present at our Church solemn Services, extolling them, and us for their sakes, even almost unto <HI>Hyperboles</HI>: So graciously is our temper entertained amongst them. As are their Churches, such is their discipline, naked of all antiquity, and almost as modern as the men which embraced it.

may justly take up the complaint of the <HI>Satyrist</HI>: saying, <HI>Surgunt nobis e Sterquitineo magistratus, nec dum tot is manibus publica tractant negotia</HI>: yet to these very men, composed equally of ignorance and a Trade, are the most weighty matters of the Church committed. In them is the power of or∣daining <HI>Priests,</HI> of conferring places of Charge, and even of the severest censure of the Church, <HI>Excommunication.</HI> When any business which concerneth the good of the Congregation is be∣fallen, they must be called to counsel, and you shall find them there as soon as ever they can put off their aprons. Having blotted out there a little classical non-sense, and passed their consents, ra∣ther by nodding of their heads, than any other sensible articulation, they hasten to their Shops, as <HI>Quinctius</HI> the <HI>Dictator,</HI> in <HI>Florus,</HI> did to his Plow, <HI>Ʋt adopus relictum festinasse videatur.</HI> Such a platform though it be, as needeth no further con∣futation then to know it, yet had it been the more tolerable, if the Contrivers of it had not endea∣voured to impose it on all the reformation; by which meanes what troubles have been raised by the great Zealots here in <HI>England,</HI> there is none so young but hath heard some tragical relations. <HI>God</HI> be magnified, and our late <HI>King</HI> praised, by whom this weed hath been snatched up out of the garden of this our <HI>Israel.</HI> As for their Ministery, it is indeed very learned in their study, and exceeding painful in their calling; by the first they confute the ignorant of the <HI>Romish Clergy</HI>: by the second their laziness: And questionless it behoveth them so to be; for living in a Country full of oppositi∣on,
<PB N="213" REF="109"/>
they are forced to a necessity of book-learning to maintain the Cause: and being continually (as it were) beset with spies, did therefore frequent the Pulpits to hold up their credits: The mainte∣nance which is alotted them scarce amounteth to a competency, though by that name they please to call it. With receiving of tythes they never meddle, and therefore in their <HI>Systematical Tra∣ctats</HI> of <HI>Divinity,</HI> they do hardly allow of paying of them: Some of them hold, that they are <HI>Jewish</HI> and abrogated with the Law: Others think them meerly to be <HI>Jure Humano</HI>: and yet that they may be lawfully accepted where they are tendered. It is well yet, that there are some amongst thē which will commend grapes though they cannot reach them: This Competency may come to forty or fifty pound yearly or a little more. <HI>Beza</HI> that great and famous Preacher of <HI>Geneva</HI> had but eighty pound a year, and about that rate was <HI>Peter du Moulins</HI> pension, when he preached at <HI>Claren∣ton.</HI> These stipends are partly paid by the <HI>King,</HI> and partly raised by way of Collection. So the Ministers of those Churches are much of the na∣ture of the <HI>English Lecturers.</HI> As for the Tythes, they belong to the several Parish Priests in whose precincts they are due: and those, I warrant you, according to the little learning which they have, will hold them to be <HI>Jure Divino.</HI> The Sermons of the <HI>French</HI> are very plain home-spun, little in them of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and less of humane learning: it being concluded in the <HI>Synode</HI> of <HI>Sappe,</HI> that onely the <HI>Scriptures</HI> should be used in their Pulpits; they consist much of exhortation and use, and of

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The connexion between the Church and Com∣mon-wealth in general. A transition to the particulars of France: The Government there meerly Regal. A mixt form of Go∣vernment most commendable.

The Chamber of Ac∣compts: <HI>France</HI> divided into three sorts of people: The <HI>Conventus Ordinum</HI> nothing but a Title. The inequality between the No∣Nobles and Commons in <HI>France.</HI> The Kings power how much respected by the Princes: The powerableness of that rank: The form of Execution done on them: The muititude and confusion of Nobility.

<HI>James</HI> defended. A Censure of the French Heralds: The power and command of the French Nobles and their Tennants, their baillages, giblets and other <HI>Regalia</HI>: Why they conspire with the King to undo the Com∣mons.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving thus spoken of the Church, I must now treat a little of the Common-wealth. Religion is as the soul of a <HI>State,</HI> policy as the bo∣dy; we can hardly discourse of the one, without a relation to the other; if we do, We commit a wil∣ful murder in the destroying a <HI>Republick.</HI> The Common-wealth without the Church is but a Car∣cass or thing inanimate: The Church without the Common-wealth is as it were, <HI>anima separata.</HI> The joyning of them together maketh of both one flourishing and permanent body: and therefore as they are in nature, so in my relations, <HI>Connubio jungam stabili.</HI> Moreover such a secret simpathy there is between them; such a necessary depen∣dency of one upon the other, that we may say of them what <HI>Tullie</HI> doth of two Twinns in his book <HI>de Fato Eorum morbus eodem tempore gravescit, &amp; eodem levatur.</HI> They grow sick and well at the same time, and commonly run out of their race at the same instant. There is besides the general respects each to other, a more particular bond betwixt them here in <HI>France,</HI> which is a likeness and resemblance in the Church of <HI>France.</HI> We have found a <HI>Head</HI> and a <HI>Body.</HI> This <HI>Body</HI> again divided into two parts, the <HI>Catholike</HI> and <HI>Protestant.</HI> The <HI>Head</HI> is
<PB N="216" REF="111"/>
in his own opinion and the minds of many others, of a power unlimited; yet the Catholike party hath strongly curbed it: And of the two parts of the body, we see the <HI>Papists</HI> flourishing and in tri∣umph, whilst that of the <HI>Protestants</HI> is in misery and affliction. Thus it is also in the <HI>Body Politick,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> in his own Conceit boundless and om∣nipotent, is yet affronted by his <HI>Nobles</HI>: which <HI>Nobles</HI> enjoy all freedom of riches and happiness; the poor <HI>Pesants</HI> in the mean time living in drudgery and bondage.</P>
<P>For the government of the <HI>King</HI> is meerly <HI>Re∣gall,</HI> or to give it the right name, <HI>Despotical</HI>: Though the Country be his Wife, and all the peo∣ple are his Children, yet doth he neither govern as a Husband or a Father: He accounteth of them all as of his servants, and therefore commandeth them as a Master. In his <HI>Edicts,</HI> which he over-frequently sendeth about, he never mentioned the good will of his Subjects, nor the approbation of his Council, but concludeth all of them in this form, <HI>Cartel est nostre plaisir: sic volo, sic jubeo.</HI> A form of government very prone to degenerate into Tyranny, if the <HI>Princes</HI> had not oftentimes strength and will to make resistance. But this not the vice of the entire and Soveraign Monar∣chy alone, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: the other two good forms of regiment being subject also to the same frailty. Thus in the reading of Histories have we observed an <HI>Aristocracie</HI> to have been frequently corrupted into an <HI>Oligarchie</HI>: and <HI>Politeia</HI> (or Common-wealth properly so called) into a <HI>Democracie.</HI> For as in the body
<PB N="217" REF="111"/>
natural the purest Complexions are less lasting, and easily broken, and subject to alteration. So it is in the body <HI>Civil:</HI> The pure and unmixt forms of government, though perfect &amp; absolute in their kinds, are of little continuance, and very sub∣ject to change into its opposite. They therefore which have written of <HI>Republicks</HI> do most applaud and commend the mixt manner of Rule, which is equally compounded of the Kingdom and <HI>Politeia,</HI> because in them <HI>Kings</HI> have all the power belong∣ing to their title, without prejudice to the proper∣ty. In these there is reserved to the <HI>King</HI> absolute Majesty, to the <HI>Nobles</HI> convenient authority, to the people an incorrupted liberty, all in a just and equal proportion. Every one of these is like the <HI>Empire</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> as it was moderated by <HI>Nerva. Qui res olim dissociabiles miscuerat principatum &amp; libertatem</HI>: wherein the soveraignty of one en∣damaged not the freedom of all. A rare mixture of government. And such is the Kingdom of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> A Kingdom of a perfect and happy com∣position, wherein the <HI>King</HI> hath his full preroga∣tive, the <HI>Nobles</HI> all due respects, and the <HI>People</HI> amongst other blessings perfect in this, that they are masters of their own purses, and have a strong hand in the making of their own Lawes.</P>
<P>On the other side, in the <HI>Regal</HI> government of <HI>France,</HI> the Subject frameth his life meerly as the <HI>Kings</HI> variable <HI>Edicts</HI> shall please to enjoyn him, is banisht of his money as the <HI>Kings</HI> task-masters think fit, and suffereth many other oppressions, which in their proper place shall be specified. This
<PB N="218" REF="112"/>
<HI>Aristotle</HI> in the third book of his <HI>Politicks</HI> cal∣leth <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the command of a Master and defineth it to be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Such an Empire, by which a <HI>Prince</HI> may command, and do whatso∣ever shall seem good in his own eyes, one of the Prerogatives <HI>Royall</HI> of the <HI>French Kings.</HI> For though the Court of <HI>Parliament</HI> doth seem to challenge a perusal of his <HI>Edicts</HI> before they pass for Laws, yet is this but a meer formality: It is the <HI>Cartell est nostre plaisir,</HI> which maketh them currant, which it seemeth these <HI>Princes</HI> learned of the <HI>Ro∣man Emperours, Justinian</HI> in the book of <HI>Insti∣tutions</HI> maketh five parts of the Civil Lawes: <HI>Viz.</HI> (He meaneth the Law of the twelve Tables:) <HI>Plebiscita, Senatus consulta, Prudentum responsa,</HI> and <HI>Principum placita</HI>: To this last he addeth this general strength, <HI>Quod principi placuerit legis habet valorem</HI>: The very foundation of the <HI>Kings</HI> pow∣erfulness. True it is yet, that the Courts of <HI>Par∣liament</HI> do use to demurre sometimes upon his <HI>Patents</HI> and <HI>Decrees,</HI> and to petition him for a Reversal of them: but his answer commonly is, <HI>Stat pro ratione Voluntas.</HI> He knoweth his own power, and granteth <HI>Letters Patents</HI> for new Offi∣ces and Monopolies abundantly. If a moneyed man can make a friend in Court, he may have an Office found for him, of six pence upon every Sword made in <HI>France</HI>: a <HI>liure</HI> upon the selling of every head of Cattel: a brace of <HI>soles</HI> for every pair of boots, and the like. It is the onely study of some men, to find out such devices of enrich∣ing themselves and undoing the people. The Pa∣tent
<PB N="219" REF="112"/>
for <HI>Mines</HI> granted to <HI>Sir Giles Mompesson,</HI> was just one of the <HI>French</HI> Offices. As for <HI>Mono∣polies,</HI> they are here so common, that the Subject taketh no notice of it, not a scurvy petty book being printed, but it hath its priviledge affixed, <HI>ad imprimendum solum.</HI> These being granted by the <HI>King,</HI> are carried to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> by them for∣mally perused, and finally verified: after which they are in force and vertue against all oppositi∣on.</P>
<P>It is said in <HI>France,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Luines</HI> had obtain∣ed a <HI>Patent</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> for a <HI>quart d' Escu</HI> to be paid unto him for the Christning of every Child throughout the <HI>Kingdom.</HI> A very unjust and un∣conscionable extortion: Had he lived to have presented it to the Court, I much doubt of their denial, though the onely cause of bringing before them such <HI>Patents,</HI> is onely intended, that they should discuss the justice and convenience of them.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Parliament</HI> hath a formality of power left in them of verifying the <HI>Kings Edicts,</HI> his grants of Offices and <HI>Monopolies</HI>; so hath the Chamber of Accompts, a superficial survey of his gifts and expences: For his expences, they are thought to be as great now as ever, by reason of the several retinues of <HI>Himself,</HI> his <HI>Mother,</HI> his <HI>Queen,</HI> and the <HI>Monsieur.</HI> Neither are his gifts lessened. The late warrs which he mannaged against the <HI>Protestants</HI> cost him dear, he being fain to bind unto him most of his <HI>Princes</HI> by money and Pensions. As the expences of the <HI>King</HI> are brought unto this Court to be examined, so are
<PB N="220" REF="113"/>
also the gifts and pensions by him granted to be ratified. The titulary power given to this <HI>Chamber,</HI> is to cut off all those of the <HI>Kings</HI> grants which have no good ground and foundation; the Officers being solemnly, at the least formally, sworn, not to suffer any thing to pass them to the detriment of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> whatsoever Letters of Command they have to the contrary: But with this Oath they do oftentimes dispense. To this <HI>Court</HI> also belongeth the Enfranchisement or <HI>Naturalization</HI> of <HI>Aliens.</HI> Anciently certain <HI>Lords, Officers</HI> of the Crown, and of the <HI>Privie Council,</HI> were appointed to look into the Ac∣compts: now it is made an ordinary and soveraign Court, consisting of two <HI>Presidents,</HI> and divers <HI>Auditors,</HI> and after, under Officers. The Chamber wherein it is kept is called, <HI>La Chambre des Comp∣tes,</HI> it is the beautifullest piece of the whole Palace, the great Chamber it self not being worthy to be named in the same day with it. It was built by <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1485. afterwards adorn∣ed and beautified by <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth, whose <HI>Statua</HI> is there standing in his Royal Robes, and the <HI>Scepter</HI> in his hand; he is accompanied by the four <HI>Cardinal-Virtues,</HI> expressed by way of <HI>Hie∣roglychick,</HI> very properly and cunning: each of them have in them its particular <HI>Motto</HI> to declare its being. The <HI>Kings</HI> Portraicture also as if he were the fifth Virtue, had its word under-written, and contained in a couple of verses, which (let all that love the <HI>Muses</HI> skip them in the reading) are these:
<Q><PB N="221" REF="113"/>
<L>Quatuor has comites fowro, caelestia dona</L>
<L>Innocuae pacis, prospera sceptra gerens.</L></Q></P>
<P>From the <HI>King</HI> descend we to the Subjects, <HI>ab equis, quod aiunt, ad asinos</HI>; and the phrase is not much improper; the French Commonalty being called the <HI>Kings Asses.</HI> These are divided into three ranks or Classes; the <HI>Clergy,</HI> the <HI>Nobless,</HI> the <HI>Paisants,</HI> out of which certain <HI>Delegates</HI> or <HI>Committees,</HI> chosen upon an occasion, and sent to the <HI>King,</HI> did anciently concurre to the making of the supreme Court for justice in <HI>France,</HI> it was called the <HI>Assembly</HI> of the three <HI>Estates,</HI> or <HI>Con∣ventus Ordinum,</HI> and was just like the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> but these meetings are now forgotten or out of use, neither indeed, as this time goeth, can they any way advantage the <HI>State.</HI> For whereas there are three principal if not sole causes of these Conventions, which are, the disposing of the Re∣gency during the non-age or sickness of a <HI>King</HI>; the granting aids or subsidies, and the redressing of grievances, there is now another course taken in them. The Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> which speaketh as it is prompted by power and greatness, appoin∣teth the <HI>Regent</HI>: the <HI>Kings</HI> themselves with their Officers determine of the taxes, and as concerning their grievances, the <HI>Kings</HI> ear is open to private Petitions. Thus is that title of a Common-wealth, which went to the making up of this Monarchy, escheated or rather devoured by the <HI>King:</HI> that name alone containing in it both <HI>Clergy, Princes</HI> and <HI>People</HI>; so that some of the <HI>French Counsellors</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="114"/>
may say with <HI>Tully</HI> in his Oration for <HI>Marcellus</HI> unto <HI>Caesar, Doleoque cum Respublica immortalis esse debeat, eam unius mortalis anima consistere:</HI> yet I cannot but withal affirm, that the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> of <HI>France</HI> do, for as much as concerneth themselves, upon all advantages fly off from the <HI>Kings</HI> obedience; but all this while the poor <HI>Paisant</HI> is ruined. Let the poor Tennant starve, or eat the bread of carefulness, it matters not, so they may have their pleasure, and be accompted firm Zealots of the Common liberty, and certain∣ly this is the issue of it; the Farmer liveth the life of a slave to maintain his <HI>Lord</HI> in pride and lazi∣ness, the <HI>Lord</HI> leadeth the life of a <HI>King</HI> to oppress his Tennant by fines and exactions. An equality little answerable to the old platforms of <HI>Repub∣licks. Aristotle, genius ille naturae,</HI> as a learned man calleth him, in his fourth book of <HI>Politicks</HI> hath an excellent discourse concerning this dis∣proportion. In that chapter his project is to have a correspondency so far between Subjects under the <HI>King,</HI> or people of the same City, that neither the one might be over rich, nor the other too mi∣serably poor. They, saith he, which are too happy, strong, or rich, or greatly favoured, and the like, cannot nor will not obey, with which evil they are infected from their infancy. The other, through want of these things, are too abjectly minded and base, for that the one cannot but command, and the other but serve, and this he calleth, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a City inhabited onely by slaves and tyrants. That questionless is the most perfect and compleat form of Government: <HI>Ʋbi veneratur
<PB N="223" REF="114"/>
potentem humilis, non timet, antecedit, non contemnit humiliorem potens,</HI> as <HI>Velleius.</HI> But this is an hap∣piness whereof <HI>France</HI> is not capable, their <HI>Lords</HI> being <HI>Kings,</HI> and their <HI>Commons Villains.</HI> And to say no less of them than in truth they are, the <HI>Princes</HI> of this Country are little inferior in mat∣ters of <HI>Royalty</HI> to any <HI>King</HI> abroad, and by conse∣quence little respective in matter of obedience to their own <HI>King</HI> at home. Upon the least discon∣tent they will draw themselves from the Court, or put themselves into Arms; and of all other com∣forts are ever sure of this, that they shall never want partizans, neither do they use to stand off from him fearfully and at distance, but justifie their revolt by publike declaration, and think the <HI>King</HI> much indebted to them, if upon fair terms, and an honourable reconcilement, they will please to put themselves again into his obedience. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth was a Prince of as undanted and uncon∣troulable a spirit, as ever any of his Predecessors, and one that loved to be obeyed, yet was he also very frequently baffled by these <HI>Roytelets,</HI> and at the last died in an affront.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> perceiving the <HI>Kings</HI> affe∣ction to his new <HI>Lady,</HI> began to grow jealous of him, for which reason he retired unto <HI>Bruxels.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> offended at this retreat sent after him, and commanded him home: The <HI>Prince</HI> returned answer, that he was the <HI>Kings</HI> most humble Sub∣ject and Servant, but into <HI>France</HI> he would not come, unless he might have a Town for his assu∣rance, withal he protected in publike writing a <HI>Nullity</HI> of any thing that should be done to his
<PB N="224" REF="115"/>
prejudice in his absence. A stomackful resolution, and somewhat misbecoming a Subject: yet in this opposition he persisted, his humour of disobedi∣ence out-living the <HI>King</HI> whom he had thus af∣fronted. But these tricks are ordinary here, other∣wise a man might have construed this action by the term of rebellion. The chief meanes whereby these <HI>Princes</HI> become so head-strong, is an immu∣nity given them by their <HI>Kings,</HI> and a liberty which they have taken to themselves: By their <HI>Kings</HI> they have been absolutely exempted from all tributes, tolles, taxes, customs, impositions and subsidies; by them they have been alwayes estated in whole entire Provinces, with a power of <HI>Hante and many justice</HI> (as the <HI>Lawyers</HI> term it) passed over unto them: the <HI>Kings</HI> having scarce an ho∣mage or acknowledgement of them. To this they have added much to their strength and securi∣ty, by the insconcing and fortifying their houses, w<SUP>ch</SUP> both often moveth &amp; afterwards enableth thē to contemn his Majesty. An example we have of this in the Castle of <HI>Rochforte,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Tremoville,</HI> which in the long <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> endured a shelf of five thousand shot and yet was not taken. A very impolitick course (in my conceit) in the French, to bestow honours and immunities upon those, <HI>Qui</HI> (as the Historian saith) <HI>ea suo arbitrio aut reposcituri, aut retentu∣rem videantur, quique modum habent in sua volun∣tate:</HI> For upon a knowledge of this strength in themselves, the <HI>Princes</HI> have been alwayes prone to civil Warrs, as having sufficient means for safe∣ty and resistance. On this ground all they write
<PB N="225" REF="115"/>
the <HI>Kings</HI> authority, and disobey his justice. Inso∣much that the greatest sort of <HI>Nobles</HI> in this <HI>King∣dom</HI> can seldom be arraigned or executed in per∣son, and therefore the Laws condemn them in their images, and hang them in their pictures. A pretty device to work justice. If by chance or some handsome sleight any of them be apprehen∣ded, they are put under a sure guard, and not doomed to death without great fear of tumult and unquietness. Neither is it <HI>Ʋnus &amp; alter,</HI> onely some two or three that thus stand upon their di∣stance with the <HI>King,</HI> but even all the <HI>Nobility</HI> of the Realm- A rout so disordered, unconfined and numberless, that even <HI>Fabius</HI> himself would be out of breath in making the reckoning. I speak not here of those that are stiled <HI>La Noblesse,</HI> but of <HI>Titulados,</HI> men onely of titular <HI>Nobility,</HI> of the degree of <HI>Baron</HI> and above: of these there is in this Country a number almost innumerable, <HI>quot Coelum stellas,</HI> take quantity for quan∣tity, and I dare be of the opinion, that Hea∣ven hath not more Stars than <HI>France Nobles</HI>; you shall meet with them so thick in the <HI>Kings</HI> Court especially, that you would think it almost impossible the Country should bear any other fruit. This I think I may safely affirm and with∣out <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> that they have there as many <HI>Princes</HI> as we in <HI>England</HI> have <HI>Dukes,</HI> as many <HI>Dukes</HI> as we <HI>Earls,</HI> as many <HI>Earls</HI> as we <HI>Barons,</HI> as many <HI>Barons</HI> as we <HI>Knights.</HI> A jolly company, and such as know their own strength too. I cannot but as much marvel, that those <HI>Kings</HI> should be so pro∣digal in conferring honours, considering this, that
<PB N="260" REF="116"/>
every <HI>Nobleman</HI> he createth is so great a weak∣ening to his power. On the other side, I cannot but as much wonder at some of our <HI>Nation,</HI> who have murmured against our late Soveraign, and accused him of an unpardonable unthriftiness, in bestowing the dignities of his Realm with so full and liberal an hand. Certainly could there any danger have risen by it unto the State, I could have been as impatient of it as another. But with us titles and ennobling in this kind, are onely either the <HI>Kings</HI> favour, or the parties merit, &amp; maketh, whomsoever he be that receiveth them, rather reverenced than powerful. <HI>Raro eorum honoribus invidetur quorum vis non timetur,</HI> was a good A∣phorism in the dayes of <HI>Paterculus,</HI> and may, for ought I know, be as good still: Why should I en∣vy any man that honour, which taketh not from my safety, or repine at my Soveraign for raising any of his Servants into an higher degree of emi∣nency, when that favour cannot make them exor∣bitant. Besides it concerneth the improvement of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> at the occasions of Subsidies: and the glory of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> when the <HI>Prince</HI> is not attended by men meerly of the <HI>Vulgar.</HI> Add to this the few <HI>Noble men</HI> of any title, which he found at his happy coming in amongst us, and the additions of power which his coming brought unto us, and we shall find it proportionable, that he should enlarge our <HI>Nobility</HI> with our Country. Neither yet have we indeed a number to be talked of, comparing us with our neighbour <HI>Nations.</HI> We may see all of the three first rank in the books of <HI>Miles, Brook,</HI> and <HI>Vincent,</HI> and we are promi∣sed
<PB N="227" REF="116"/>
also a Catalogue of the creations and successi∣ons of all our <HI>Barons</HI>; then we should see that as yet we have not surfeited. Were this care taken by the <HI>Heralds</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> perhaps the <HI>Nobility</HI> there would not seem so numberless, sure I am, not so confused: but this is the main vice of that Pro∣fession: of six <HI>Heralds</HI> which they have amongst them, <HI>Viz Mountjoy, Normandy, Guyenns, Valoys, Britain,</HI> and <HI>Burgoyne,</HI> not one of them is reported to be a <HI>Genealogist</HI>: Neither were their <HI>Predecessors</HI> better affected to this study. <HI>Peradine</HI> the onely man that ever was amongst them, hath drawn down the <HI>Genealogies</HI> of twenty four of the cheif Families, all eminent and of the bloud; in which he hath excellently well discharged him∣self: but what a small pittance is that, compared to the present multitude.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nobles</HI> being so populous, it cannot be but the <HI>Nobless</HI> (as they call them) that is, the <HI>Gentry,</HI> must needs be thick set, and onely not innumera∣ble. Of these <HI>Nobless</HI> there be some that hold their estates immediately of the <HI>Crown,</HI> and they have the like immunity with the <HI>Princes.</HI> Some hold their <HI>feifes</HI> (or <HI>seuda</HI>) of some other of the <HI>Lords,</HI> and he hath onely <HI>Basse justice</HI> permitted to him, as to mulct and amerce his Tennants, to imprison them, or to give them any other correcti∣on under death. All of them have power to raise and enhaunce up their rents, to tax his Subjects on occasion, and to prohibite them such pleasures, as they think fit to be reserved for themselves. In <HI>Grettanl</HI> in <HI>Picardie</HI> I saw a post fastened in the ground, like a race-post with us, and thereon an in∣scription,

I made presently to it, as hoping to have heard news of sōe memorable battel there fought, but when I came at it, I found it to be nothing but a declaration of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Condes</HI> pleasure, that no man should hunt in those quarters. After∣ward I observed them to be very frequent. But not to wander through all particulars, I will in some few of them onely give instance of their power here.</P>
<P>The first is <HI>Droict de Balliage,</HI> power to keep <HI>Assizes,</HI> or to have under them a <HI>Baillie,</HI> and an <HI>Imperial</HI> seat of justice, for the definition of such causes as fall under the compass of ordinary juris∣diction. In this Court there is notice taken of treason, robberies, murthers, protections, pardons, fairs, markets, and other matters of priviledge.</P>
<P>Next they have a Court of ordinary jurisdicti∣on, and therein a <HI>Judge</HI> whom they call <HI>Le Guarde de Justice,</HI> for the decision of smaller business, as debts, trespass, breach of the <HI>Kings</HI> peace, and the like. In this the purse is onely emptied; the other extendeth to the taking away of the life; for which every one that hath <HI>Hante Justice</HI> annexed to his <HI>feife,</HI> hath also his particular Gibbet. Nay, which is wonderful methodical, by the <HI>Criticisme</HI> of the <HI>Gibbet</HI> you may judge at the quality of him that owneth it, for the <HI>Gibbet</HI> of one of the <HI>No∣blesse</HI> hath but two pillars, that of the <HI>Chastellan</HI> three, the <HI>Barons</HI> four, the <HI>Earls</HI> six, the <HI>Dukes</HI> eight, and yet this difference is rather precise than general.</P>
<P>The last of their <HI>jura Regalia,</HI> which I will here speak of, is the Command they have upon the peo∣ple
<PB N="229" REF="117"/>
to follow them unto the warrs, a Command not so advantagious to the <HI>Lord,</HI> as dangerous to the <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>Thus live the <HI>French Princes,</HI> thus the <HI>Noblesse,</HI> thus those Sheep which <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Laws</HI> hath brought under them, they do not shear, but fleece them, and (which is worse than this) having themselves taken away the wooll, they give up the naked carcass to the <HI>King. Tonderi oves meas vo∣lo, non deglubi</HI>; was accounted one of the golden sayings of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> but it is not currant here in <HI>France</HI>: Here the <HI>Lord</HI> and the <HI>King,</HI> though otherwise at odds amongst themselves, be sure to agree in this, the undoing and oppressing of the <HI>Paisant. Ephraim</HI> against <HI>Manasseh,</HI> and <HI>Mas∣nasseh</HI> against <HI>Ephraim,</HI> but both against <HI>Juda,</HI> saith the <HI>Scripture.</HI> The reason why they thus desire the poverty of the Commons, is, as they pretend, the safety of the <HI>State,</HI> and their own particulars. Were the people once warmed with the feeling of ease, and their own riches, they would be presently hearkening after the Warrs. And if no employ∣ment were offered abroad, they would make some at home. Histories and experience hath taught us enough of this humour in this kind: it being impossible for this hot-headed and hare-brain'd people not to be doing. <HI>Si extraneus deest domi hostem quaerunt</HI>: as <HI>Justin</HI> hath observed of the ancient <HI>Spaniards.</HI> A pretty quality, and for which they have often smarted.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY that which hath been spoken already of the <HI>Nobless,</HI> we may partly guess at the low estate of the <HI>Paisant</HI> or Country man: of whom we will not now speak, as Subjects to their <HI>Lords,</HI> and how
<PB N="231" REF="118"/>
farre they are under their commandment, but how miserable and wretched they are in their apparel and their houses: For their apparel, it is well if they can allow themselves Canvas, or an outside of that nature: As for Cloath, it is above their purse, equally, and their ambition: if they can as∣pire unto Fustian, they are as happy as their wishes: and he that is so arrayed, will not spare to aim at the best place in the Parish, even unto that of Church-Warden: When they go to Plow or to the Church they have shooes and stockings; at other times they make bold with Nature and wear their skins. Hats they will not want though their bellies pinch for it: and that you may be sure they have them, they will alwayes keep them on their heads. The most impudent custom of a beggarly fortune that ever I met with, and which already hath had my blessing. As for the Women, they know in what degree Nature hath created them, and therefore dare not be so fine as their Hus∣bands: some of them never had above one pair of stockings in all their lives, which they wear every day, for indeed they are very durable: the goodness of their faces tels us that they have no need of a band, therefore they use none. And as concerning petticoats, so it is, that all have such a garment, but most of them so short, that you would imagine them to be cut off at the placket: When the parents have sufficiently worn these ve∣stures, and that commonly is till the rottenness of them will save the labour of undressing; they are a new cut out and fittted to the Children. Search into their houses, and you shall find them very
<PB N="232" REF="119"/>
wretched, and destitute, as well of furniture as provision. No butter salted up against Winter, no poudering tub, no pullein in the rick barten, no flesh in the pot, or at the spit, and which is worse, no money to buy them. The description of the poor aged couple, <HI>Philemon</HI> and <HI>Baucis,</HI> in the eigth book of the <HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> is a perfect cha∣racter of the <HI>French Paisant</HI> in his house-keeping, though I cannot affirm, that if <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Mer∣cury</HI> did come amongst them, they should have so hearty an entertainment; for thus <HI>Ovid</HI> marshel∣leth the dishes.</P>

patilla,</HI> the best provision they can shew you, is a piece of <HI>Bacon</HI> where with to fatten their pottage, and now and then the inwards of Beasts killed for the Gentleman. But of their miseries, this me thinketh is the greatest, that sowing so many acres of excellent Wheat in a year, and gathering in such a plentiful vintage as they do, they should not yet be so fortunate as to eat white bread, or drink Wine: for such infinite rents do they pay to their <HI>Lords,</HI> and such innumerable taxes to the <HI>King,</HI> that the profits arising out of these commodities are onely sufficient to pay their duties, and keep them from the extremities of cold and famine. The bread which they eat is of the coursest flower, and so black that it cannot admit the name of brown, and as for their drink, they have recourse unto the next fountain: A people of any the most infortunate, not permitted to enjoy the fruit of their labours: and such as above all others are subject to that <HI>Sarcasme</HI> in the <HI>Gospel, This man planted a Vineyard, and doth not drink of the fruit thereof.</HI></P>
<Q>Neo prosunt Domino, quae prosunt omnibus artes.</Q>
<P>Yet were their cases not altogether so deplora∣ble, if there were but hopes left to them of a bet∣ter; if they could but compass this certainty, that a painful drudging and thrifty saving would one day bring them out of this hell of bondage. In this questionless they are entirely miserable; in that they are sensible of their present fortunes, and dare not labour nor expect an alteration.
<PB N="234" REF="120"/>
If industry and a sparing hand hath raised any of these afflicted people so high, that he is but four or five shillings richer than his neighbour, his <HI>Lord</HI> immediately enhanceth his rent, and enformeth the <HI>Kings</HI> task-masters of his riches; by which meanes he is within two or three years brought into equal poverty with the rest. A strange course and much different from that of <HI>England</HI>; where the <HI>Gentry</HI> take a delight in having their Tennants thrive under them, and account it no crime in any that hold of them to be wealthy. On the other side, those of <HI>France</HI> can abide no body to gain or grow rich upon their Farms, and therefore thus upon occasions rack their poor Tennants. In which they are like the <HI>Tyrant Procrustes,</HI> who laying hands upon all he met, cast them upon his bed: if they were shorter than it, he racked their joynts till he had made them even to it; if they were longer, he cut as much of their bodies from them as did hang over; so keeping all that fell into his power in an equality of stature. I need not make further application of the story but this, that the <HI>French Lords</HI> are like that <HI>Tyrant.</HI></P>
<P>How much this course doth depress the military power of the Kingdom, is apparent by the true principles of warr, and the examples of other Countries. For it hath been held the general opinion of the best judgements in matters of war, that the main buttress and pillar of an Army is the foot, or (as the <HI>Martialists</HI> term it) the infantry. Now to make a good infantry, it requireth that men be brought up not in a slavish or needy fa∣shion of life, but in some free and liberal manner.
<PB N="235" REF="120"/>
Therefore it is well observed by the <HI>Viscount St. Albons</HI> in his history of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, that if a State run most to <HI>Nobles</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> and that the Husbandmen be but as their meer drudges, or else simple Cottagers, that that State may have a good <HI>Cavilleria,</HI> but never good stable bands of Foot: like to Coppines wood, in which, if you let them grow too thick in the standerds, they will run to bushes or briers, and have little clean under wood. Neither is it thus in <HI>Franne</HI> onely, but in <HI>Italy</HI> also, and some other parts abroad; insomuch that they are enforced to employ mercenary Souldiers for their battalions of Foot; whereby it cometh to pass in those Countries, that they have much peo∣ple but few men.</P>
<P>On this consideration <HI>King Henry</HI> the seventh, one of the wisest of our <HI>Princes,</HI> took a course so cunning and wholesome for the encrease of the military power of this Realm, that though it be much less in territories, yet it should have infinite∣ly more Souldiers of its native forces than its neighbour Nations. For in the fourth year of his raign there passed an Act of Parliament preten∣sively against the depopulation of Villages and decay of tillage, but purposely to make his Sub∣jects for the warrs. The Act was, that all houses of Husbandry which had been used with twenty acres of ground and upwards should be maintain∣ed and kept up so, together with a competent pro∣portion of Land to be used and occupied with them, &amp;c. By this meanes the houses being kept up, did of necessity enfarce a dweller, and that dweller, because of the proportion of Land, not to
<PB N="236" REF="121"/>
be a beggar, but a man of some substance, able to keep hinds and servants, and to set the Plow go∣ing. An Order which did wonderfully concern the might and manhood of the Kingdom, these Farmers being sufficient to maintain an able body out of penury, and by consequence to prepare them for service, and encourage them to high ho∣nours: for,
<Q><L>Haud facile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obstat</L>
<L>Res angusta domi —</L>
<L>As the <HI>Poet</HI> hath it.</L></Q>
But this Ordinance is not thought of such use in <HI>France</HI>; where all the hopes of their Armies con∣sist in the Cavallery or the Horse; which perhaps is the cause why our Ancestors have won so many battels upon them: As for the <HI>French</HI> Foot, they are quite out of all reputation, and are accounted to be the basest and unworthiest company in the world.</P>
<P>Besides, should the <HI>French</HI> people be enfranchi∣zed as it were from the tyranny of their <HI>Lords,</HI> and estated in free hold, and other tenures after the manner of <HI>England,</HI> it would much trouble the <HI>Councill</HI> of <HI>France</HI> to find out a new way of raising the <HI>Kings</HI> Revenues, which are now meerly sucked out of the bloud and sweat of the Subject. An∣ciently the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> had rich and plentiful demeasnes, such as was sufficient to maintain their Majesty and greatness, without being burdensome unto the Country. Pride in matters of sumptu∣ousness and the tedious Civil warrs which have
<PB N="237" REF="121"/>
lasted in this Country almost ever since the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, have been the occasion, that most of the Crown Lands have been sold and morgaged: insomuch that the people are now become the <HI>Demain,</HI> and the Subject onely is the revenue of the Crown; by the sweat of their brows is the Court fed and the Souldier paid, and by their labours are the <HI>Princes</HI> maintained in idle∣ness. What impositions soever it pleaseth the <HI>King</HI> to put upon them, it is almost a point of treason, not onely to deny, but to question: <HI>Apud illos vere regnatur, nefasque quantum regi liceat dubitare</HI>; as one of them: The <HI>Kings</HI> hand lieth hard upon them, and hath almost thrust them into an Egypti∣an bondage: the poor <HI>Paisant</HI> being constrained to make up daily his full tale of brick, and yet have no straw allowed him. Upon the sight of these miseries and poverties of this people, Sir <HI>John Fortescue Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in his book intituled, <HI>De laudibus Regum Angliae,</HI> concludeth them to be unfit men for <HI>Jurers</HI> or <HI>Judges,</HI> should the custom of the Country admit of such a trial: for having proved there unto the <HI>Prince</HI> (he was Son unto <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth) that the manner of trial, according to the Common Law, by twelve <HI>Jurats,</HI> was more commendable than the practise of the Civil or Imperial Laws, by the deposition onely of two Witnesses, or the forced confession of the person arraigned: the <HI>Prince</HI> seemed to marvel, <HI>Cur ea lex Angliae quae tam frugi &amp; op∣tabilis est, non sit toti mundo communis</HI>: to this he maketh answer, by shewing the free condition of the <HI>English</HI> Subjects, who alone are used at these
<PB N="238" REF="122"/>
Inditements; men of a fair and large estate, such as dwell nigh the place of the deed committed: men that are of ingenuous education, such as scorn to be suborned or corrupted, and afraid of infamy. Then he sheweth how in other places all things are contrary: the Husbandman an ab∣solute beggar, easie to be bribed by reason of his poverty: The Gentlemen living far asunder, and so taking no notice of the fact. The <HI>Paisant</HI> also neither fearing infamy nor loss of goods if he be found faulty, because he hath them not. In the end he concludeth thus: <HI>Nec mireris igitur prin∣ceps, si lex quae</HI> Anglia <HI>veritas inquiritur, ab ea non pervagetur in alias nationes: Ipsae namque, ut</HI> An∣glia, <HI>nequeunt facere sufficientes, consimilesque jura∣tas.</HI> The last part of the <HI>Latine</HI> savoureth some∣what of the <HI>Lawyer</HI>; the word <HI>Jurata</HI> being there put to signifie a <HI>Jury.</HI></P>
<P>To go over all those impositions, which this miserable people are afflicted withal, were almost as wretched as the payment of them. I will there∣fore speak onely of the principal: and here I meet in the first place with the <HI>gabel</HI> or imposition on <HI>Salt.</HI> This <HI>gabelle de Sel,</HI> this Impost on Salt was first begun by <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Long,</HI> who took for it a <HI>Double,</HI> which is half a <HI>Sol,</HI> upon the pound. After whom <HI>Philip de Valoys, Anno</HI> 1328. doubled it. <HI>Charles</HI> the seventh raised it unto three <HI>Doubles,</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh unto six; since that time it hath been altered from so much upon the pound to a certain rate on the Maid, which containeth some thirty bushels <HI>English,</HI> the rates rising and falling at the <HI>Kings</HI> pleasure. This one Commo∣dity
<PB N="239" REF="122"/>
were very advantagious to the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> were it all in the <HI>Kings</HI> hands; but at this time a great part of it is morgaged. It is thought to be worth unto the <HI>King</HI> three millions of Crowns yearly, that onely of <HI>Paris</HI> and the <HI>Provosts</HI> seven Daughters being farmed at 1700000. Crowns the year. The late <HI>Kings</HI> since <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. being intangled in warrs, have been constrained to let it to others; insomuch that about <HI>Anno</HI> 1599. the <HI>King</HI> lost above 800000. Crowns yearly: and no longer then <HI>Anno</HI> 1621. the <HI>King</HI> taking up 600000. pounds of the <HI>Provost</HI> of the <HI>Merchants</HI> and the <HI>Eschevins,</HI> gave unto them a Rent charge of 40000. pound yearly, to be issuing out of the customs of Salt till their money were repaid them. This <HI>gabel</HI> is indeed a <HI>Monopolie,</HI> and that one of the unjustest and unmeasurablest in the world: for no man in the Kingdom (those Countries hereafter mentioned excepted) can eat any Salt, but he must buy it of the <HI>King,</HI> and at his price, which is most unconscionable; that being sold at <HI>Paris</HI> and else∣where for five <HI>liures,</HI> which in the exempted pla∣ces is sold for one. Therefore that the <HI>Kings</HI> profits might not be diminished, there is diligent watch and ward, that no forrain Salt be brought into the Land, upon pain of forfeiture and impri∣sonment. A search that is made so strictly, that we had much ado at <HI>Diepe</HI> to be pardoned the searching of our Trunks and Port-mantues; and that not but upon our solemn protestations, that we had none of that Commodity. This Salt is of a brown colour, being onely such as we in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> call <HI>Bay Salt,</HI> &amp; is imposed on the Subjects by
<PB N="240" REF="123"/>
the <HI>Kings</HI> Officers with great rigor. For though they have some of their last provision in the house, or perchance would be content (through pover∣ty) to eat their meat without it; yet will these cruel villains enforce them to take such a quantity of them; howsoever they will have of them so much money. But this tyranny is not general; the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Picards</HI> enduring most of it, and the other <HI>Paisants</HI> the rest. Much like unto this was the licence which the <HI>Popes</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> of old granted in matter of keeping <HI>Concubines</HI>: for when such as had the charge of gathering the <HI>Popes</HI> rents happened upon a Priest which had no <HI>Concubine,</HI> and for that cause made denial of the tribute, the Collectors would return them this an∣swer, that notwithstanding this they should pay down the money, because they might have had the keeping of a Wench if they would.</P>
<P>This <HI>gabel</HI> as it sitteth hard upon some, so are there some also, who are never troubled with it: of this sort are the <HI>Princes</HI> in the general release, and many of the <HI>Nobless</HI> in particular: insomuch that it was proved unto <HI>King Lewis, Anno</HI> 1614. that for every Gentleman which took of his Majesties Salt, there were two thousand of the Commons. There are also some entire Provinces which refuse to eat of this Salt, as <HI>Britain, Gascoine, Poictou, Queren, Naintogne,</HI> and the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Boulonnois.</HI> Of these the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Boulonnois</HI> pretendeth a peculiar exemption, as belonging immediately to the patrimony of our <HI>Lady (Nostre-Dame)</HI> of which we shall learn more when we are in <HI>Bovil∣lon.</HI> The <HI>Britains</HI> came united to the Crown by a
<PB N="241" REF="123"/>
fair marriage, and had strength enough to make their own Capitulations, when they first entered into the <HI>French</HI> subjection; besides, here are yet divers of the <HI>Ducal</HI> Family living in the Country, who would much trouble the quiet of the King∣dom, should the people be oppressed with this bondage, and they take the protection of them. <HI>Poictou</HI> and <HI>Queren</HI> have compounded for it with the former <HI>Kings,</HI> and pay a certain rent yearly; which is called the <HI>Equivalent. Xaintogne</HI> is un∣der the command of <HI>Rochell,</HI> of whom it receiveth sufficient at a better rate. And as for the <HI>Gascoynes</HI> the <HI>King</HI> dareth not impose it upon them for fear of rebellion. They are a stubborn and churlish people, very impatient of a rigorous yoak; and such as inherit a full measure of the <HI>Beiseains</HI> liber∣ty and spirit, from whom they are descended. <HI>Le Droit de fonage,</HI> the priviledge of levying of a certain peice of money upon every Chimney in an house that smoaked, was in times not long since one of the <HI>Jura Regalia</HI> of the <HI>French Lords,</HI> and the people paid it without grumbling: yet when <HI>Edward</HI> the black Prince returned from his unhap∣py journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> and for the paying of his Souldiers to whō he was indebted, laid this <HI>fonage</HI> upon the people, being then <HI>English,</HI> they all pre∣sently revolted to the <HI>French,</HI> and brought great prejudice to our affairs in those quarters.</P>
<P>Next unto the <HI>Gabel</HI> of Salt we may place the <HI>Taille</HI> and the <HI>Taillon</HI>; which are much of a na∣ture with the <HI>Subsidies</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> being granted by the people, and the sum of that certain shall please to impose them. Anciently the <HI>Tailles</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="124"/>
were onely levied by way of extraordinary subsi∣die, and that upon four occasions, which were, the <HI>Knighting</HI> of the <HI>Kings</HI> Son, the <HI>Marriage</HI> of his <HI>Daughters,</HI> a <HI>Voyage</HI> of the <HI>Kings</HI> beyond Sea, and his <HI>Ransome</HI> in case he were taken Prisoner. <HI>Les Tailles ne sont point deves de devoyer ordicmer</HI> (saith <HI>Rayneau) ains ont este accorded, durant la necessite des Affaires Semblement.</HI> Afterward they were continually levied in times of warr, and at length <HI>Charles</HI> the first made them ordinary, neither is it extended equally, all of it would amount to a very fair revenue. For supposing this, that the <HI>King∣dom</HI> of <HI>France</HI> contained two hundred millions of acres (as it doth) and that from every one there were raised to the <HI>King</HI> two <HI>Sols</HI> yeerly; which is little in respect of the taxes imposed on them; that income alone, besides that which levied on goods personal, would amount to two millions of pounds in a year. But this payment also lyeth all on the <HI>Paisant.</HI> The greater Towns, the Officers of the <HI>Kings House,</HI> the Officers of Warrs, the <HI>Presidents, Counsellors</HI> and Officers of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Parlia∣ment;</HI> the <HI>Nobility,</HI> the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and the <HI>Schollars</HI> of the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> being freed from it. That which they call the <HI>Taillon,</HI> was intended for the ease of the Country, though now it prove one of the greatest burdens unto it. In former times, the <HI>Kings</HI> Souldiers lay all upon the charge of the Villages, the poor people being fain to find them diet, lodging and all necessaries for themselves, their horses and their harlots, which they brought with them. If they were not well pleased with their entertainment, they used commonly to beat
<PB N="243" REF="124"/>
their Host, abuse his family, and rob him of that small provision which he had laid up for his Chil∣dren, and all this <HI>Cum privilegio.</HI> Thus did they move from one Village to another, and at the last returned unto them from whence they came, <HI>Ita ut non sit ibi villula una expers calamitatis istius, quae non semel aut bis in anno hac nefandâ pressurâ depiletur,</HI> as Sir <HI>John F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtescue</HI> observed in his time. To redress this mischeif, <HI>King Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Anno</HI> 1549. raised his Imposition called the <HI>Tail∣lon,</HI> issuing out of the lands and goods of the poor Country man; whereby he was at the first some∣what eased: but now all is again out of order, the miserable Paisant being oppressed by the Souldier as much as ever, and yet he still payeth both taxes▪ the <HI>Taille</HI> and the <HI>Taillon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pancarte</HI> comprehendeth in it divers par∣ticular imposts, but especially the <HI>Sol</HI> upon the <HI>Liure,</HI> that is, the twentieth penny of all things bought or sold (corn, sallets, and the like onely excepted.) Upon wine, besides the <HI>Sol</HI> upon the <HI>Liure,</HI> he hath his several customs at the entrance of it into any of his Cities, passages by Land, Sea, or River. To these <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1561. added a tax of five <HI>Sols</HI> upon every <HI>Maid,</HI> which is the third part of a Tun, and yet when all this is done, the poor <HI>Vintner</HI> payeth unto the <HI>King</HI> the eighth penny he takes for that wine which he sel∣leth.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Pancart</HI> is also contained the <HI>bant passage,</HI> which are the tols paid unto the <HI>King,</HI> for passage of men and cattel over his bridges and his City gates, as also for all such Commodities which they
<PB N="244" REF="125"/>
bring with them. A good and round sum consi∣dering the largeness of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> the <HI>thorough∣fare of Lyons</HI> being farmed yearly of the <HI>King</HI> for 100000. Crowns. Hereunto belong also the <HI>Aides,</HI> which are a taxe also of the <HI>Sol</HI> on the <HI>Liure,</HI> upon all sorts of fruits, provision, wares and Merchandize, granted first unto <HI>Charles Duke</HI> of <HI>Normandy,</HI> when <HI>John</HI> his <HI>Father</HI> was prisoner in <HI>England</HI>; and since made perpetual. For such is the lamentable fate of that Country, that their kindnesses are made duties; and those moneys which they once grant out of love, are alwayes af∣ter exacted of them, and paid out of necessity. The bedrolle of all these impositions and taxes is cal∣led the <HI>Paneart,</HI> because it was hanged up in a frame, like as the Officers Fees are in our <HI>Bishops Diocesan</HI> Courts; the word <HI>Pan</HI> signifying a frame or pane of wainscot. These impositions time and custom hath now made tolerable, though at first day they seemed very burdensome, and moved many Cities to murmuring, some to rebellion. A∣mongst others the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> proud of her an∣cient liberties and immunities, refused to admit of it. This indignity so incensed <HI>Charles</HI> the sixth their <HI>King,</HI> then young and in hot bloud, that he seized into his hands all their priviledges, took from their <HI>Provost des Merchants</HI> and the <HI>Esche∣vins,</HI> as also the key of their gates, and the chains of their streets, and making through the whole Town such a face of mourning, that one might justly have said:
<Q>Haec facies <HI>Troiae</HI> cum caperetur erat.</Q>
<PB N="245" REF="125"/>
This happened in the year 1383. and was for five years together continued; which time being ex∣pired, and other Cities warned by that example, the imposition was established, and the priviledges restored. For the better regulating of the profits arising from these imposts, the <HI>French King</HI> erect∣ed a <HI>Court, Le Cour des Aides.</HI> It consisted at the first of the general of the <HI>Aides,</HI> and of any four of the <HI>Lords</HI> of the Councel, whom they would call to their assistance. Afterwards <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1380. or thereabouts, settled it in <HI>Paris</HI> and caused it to be numbred as one of the <HI>Sove∣raign Courts, Lewis</HI> the eleventh dissolved it, and committed the managing of his <HI>Aids</HI> to his House∣hold servants, as loath to have any publike Officers take notice how he fleeced his people, <HI>Anno</HI> 1464. it was restored again. And finally <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣cond, <HI>Anno</HI> 1551. added to it a second Chamber, composed of two <HI>Presidens</HI> and eight <HI>Counsellors.</HI> One of which <HI>Presidents,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cavilayer,</HI> is said to be the best moneyed man of all <HI>France.</HI> There are also others of these Courts in the Country: as one at <HI>Roven,</HI> one at <HI>Montferrant</HI> in <HI>Averyne,</HI> one at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and another at <HI>Montpellier</HI> established by <HI>Charles</HI> the first, <HI>Anno</HI> 1537. For the levying and gathering up of rhese taxes, you must know, that the whole Country of <HI>France</HI> is divided into twenty three generalities and Counties as it were, and these again into divers <HI>Eslections,</HI> which are much like unto our Hundreds. In every of the Generalities there are ten or twelve Treasurers, nine Receivers for the Generality, and as many Controulers, besides all under Officers, which are
<PB N="246" REF="126"/>
thought to amount in all to thirty thousand men. When the <HI>King</HI> levieth his taxes, he sendeth his <HI>Letters Patents</HI> to the principal Officers of every Generality, whom they call <HI>Les genereaux des Aides,</HI> and they dispatch their warrant to the <HI>Ezlenzor</HI> Commissioners. These taxing every one of the Parishes and Villages within their se∣veral divisions at a certain rate, send their Recei∣vers to collect it, who account for it to their Con∣troulers, by them it ascendeth <HI>Ezleie</HI>; from him to the Receiver general of that Generality, next to the Controuler, then to the Treasurer, after∣wards to the <HI>General des Aides</HI>; and so

By all these hands it is at last conveyed into the <HI>Kings</HI> purse: in which several passage, <HI>necesse est ut aliquid haereat,</HI> it cannot be, but it must needs have many a shrewd snatch: Insomuch that I was told by a Gentleman of good credence in <HI>France,</HI> that there could not be gathered by the several exactions above specified, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other devices of prowling (which I have omitted) less than eighty five millions a year, whereof the <HI>King</HI> receiveth fifteen onely. A report not altogether to be sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghted: considering that a <HI>President</HI> of the Court of Accompts made it evident to the Assem∣bly at <HI>Blois</HI> in the time of <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth, that by the time that every one of the Officers had had his share of it, there came not to the <HI>Kings</HI> Coffers one <HI>teston</HI> (which is one shilling four
<PB N="247" REF="126"/>
pence) of a Crown: So that by reckoning five <HI>testons</HI> to a Crown or <HI>Escue,</HI> as it is but two pence over, these Officers must collect five times the money which they pay to the <HI>King</HI>; which a∣mouteth to seventy five millions, and is not much short of that proportion which before I spake of. The <HI>Kings</HI> revenues then, notwithstanding this infinite oppression of his people, amounteth to fifteen millions; some would have it eighteen, which is also a good improvement in respect of what they were in times afore. <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh as good a Husband of his Crown, as ever any was in <HI>France,</HI> gathering but one and an half onely, but as you count the <HI>flow,</HI> so also if you reckon the <HI>ebb</HI> of his treasures, you will find much wanting of a full sea in his Coffers, it being generally known, that the Fees of Officers, Pensions, Garrisons and the men of Arms draw from him yearly, no fewer than six of his fifteen millions. True it is, that his Treasure hath many good helps by way of <HI>Es∣cheat,</HI> and that most frequently when he cometh to take an account of his Treasurers and other Offi∣cers. An action so abominable, full of base and unmannly villanies in their several charges, that the <HI>Publicans</HI> of old <HI>Rome</HI> were milk and white broth to them: For so miserably do they abuse the poor Paisant, that if he hath in all the world but eight <HI>Sols,</HI> it shall go hard but he will extort from him five of them.

He is just of the nature of the <HI>Horsleach,</HI> when he

hath once gotten hold of you, he will never let you go till he be filled, and which is most strange, he thinks it a greater clemency, that he hath left the poor man some of his money, than the cruelty was in wresting from him the rest. Nay they will brag of it, when they have taken but five of the eight <HI>Sols,</HI> that they have given him three, and expect thanks for it. A kindness of a very theevish na∣ture, it being the condition of Robbers, as <HI>Tully</HI> hath observed, <HI>Ʋt commemorent iis se dedisse vitam, quibus non ademerint.</HI> Were the people but so happy as to have a certain rate set upon their mi∣series, it could not but be a great ease to them, and would well defend them from the tyranny of these theeves: but, which is not the least part of their wretchedness, their taxings and assemblings are left arbitrary, and are exacted according as these <HI>Publicans</HI> will give out of the <HI>Kings</HI> necessities. So that the Country man hath no other remedy, than to give <HI>Cerberus</HI> a crust, as the saying, is, and to kiss his rod and hug his punishment. By this meanes the <HI>Quaestors</HI> thrive abundantly, it being commonly said of them, <HI>Fari bouvier au jourd huy Cheualier,</HI> to day a Swineheard, to morrow a Gen∣tleman; and certainly they grow into great riches.

grand Chamber of <HI>Parliament,</HI> though as yet he cannot be apprehended &amp; advanced to the ladder, And this hath been the end of many of them since the raign of this present <HI>King</HI> (whom it may be for this cause they call <HI>Lewis the Just:</HI>) This fa∣shion of affixing Epithites to the names of their <HI>Kings,</HI> was in great use heretofore with this Nati∣on. <HI>Carolus</HI> the Son of <HI>Pipin</HI> was by them sur∣named <HI>Le magne: Lewis</HI> his Son <HI>Le Debonaire</HI>; and so of the rest: since the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the sixth, who was by them surnamed the <HI>Beloved,</HI> it was discontinued and new revived again in the persons of <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth and his Son <HI>King Lewis</HI>: (but this by the way.) It may be also he is called the <HI>Just</HI> by way of negation; because he hath yet committed no notable act of injustice (for I wink at his cruel and unjust slaugh∣ter at <HI>Nigrepelisse.</HI>) It may be also to keep him continually in mind of his duty, that he may make himself worthy of that attribute: <HI>Vere Imperator sui nominis,</HI> as one said of <HI>Severus.</HI></P>
<P>Let us add one more misery to the <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Commonalty</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and that is the base and corrupt money in it: for besides the <HI>Sol</HI> which is made of <HI>Tin,</HI> they have the <HI>Double</HI> made of <HI>Brass,</HI> where of six make a <HI>Sol,</HI> and the <HI>Deneir,</HI> whereof two make a <HI>Double</HI>: a Coin so vile &amp; base of value, that one hundred and twenty of them go to our English Shilling: These are the common Coins of the Country. Silver and Gold not being to be seen but upon holy-dayes. As for their Silver it is most of it of their new coining, but all exceed∣ingly clipt and shorn, their Gold being most of it
<PB N="250" REF="128"/>
<HI>Spanish.</HI> In my little being in the Country, though I casually saw much Gold, I could onely see two pieces of <HI>French</HI> stamp, the rest coming all from <HI>Spain,</HI> as <HI>Pistolets, Demi pistolets,</HI> and double <HI>Pi∣stolets.</HI> Neither is <HI>France</HI> onely furnisht thus with <HI>Chastilian</HI> Coin; it is happiness also of other Countries, as <HI>Italy, Barbary, Brabant,</HI> and else∣where, and indeed it is kindly done of him, that being the sole <HI>Monopolist</HI> of the <HI>Mines,</HI> he will yet let other Nations have a share in the mettal. Were the <HI>King</HI> as <HI>Catholike</HI> as his money, I think I should be in some fear of him; till then we may lawfully take that ambitious title from the <HI>King,</HI> and bestow it on his pictures: the soveraignty of the <HI>Spanish</HI> gold is more universally embraced, and more seri∣ously acknowledged in most parts of Christen∣dom, than that of him which stampt it. To this he, which entituleth himself <HI>Catholike,</HI> is but a prisoner, and never saw half those Provinces, in which this more powerful Monarch hath been heartily welcommed: And yet if he will needs be <HI>King</HI> let him grow somewhat more jealous of his <HI>Queen,</HI> and confess that his Gold doth royally deserve his embraces, whom before this extent of its dominion, the ancient <HI>Poets</HI> stiled, <HI>Regina Pecu∣nia.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, that by the frame and shape of this <HI>Empress</HI> you would little think her to be lovely, and less worthy your entertainment, the stones which little boys break into quoyts, are a great deal better proportioned. If a <HI>Geometrician</HI> were to take the angles of it, I think it would quite put him besides his <HI>Euclide:</HI> Neither can I tell to
<PB N="251" REF="128"/>
what thing in the world fitter to resemble it, then a <HI>French</HI> Cheese, for it is neither long, nor square, nor round, nor thin, nor thick, nor any one of these, but yet all, and yet none of them. No question it was the <HI>Kings</HI> desire, by this unsightly dressing of his <HI>Lady,</HI> to make men out of love with her, that so he might keep her to himself; but in this his hopes have cozened him: for as in other Cuckoldings, so in this, some men will be bold to keep his Wife from him, be it onely in spite.</P>
<P>These circumstances thus laid together and considered, we may the clearer and the better see our own felicities, which to exprese generally and in a word, is to say onely this, that the <HI>English</HI> sub∣ject is in no circumstance a <HI>French-man</HI>: here have we our money made of the best and purest matal, that onely excepted which a charitable considera∣tion hath coined into farthings: here have we our <HI>King</HI> royally, and to the envy of the world, magni∣ficently provided for, without the sweat and bloud of the people: no pillages nor impositions upon any private wares; no Gabels upon our Commo∣dities: <HI>Nullum in tam ingenti regno vestigal: non in urbibus pontium vae discriminibus publicanorum stationes</HI>; as one truly hath observed of us. The moneys which the <HI>King</HI> wanteth to supply his ne∣cessities are here freely given him, he doth not compel our bounties, but accept them. The Laws by which we are governed, we impart, are makers of: each Peasant of the Countrey hath a free voice in the enacting of them, if not in his person, yet in his <HI>Proxie:</HI> we are not here subject to the lusts and tyranny of our <HI>Lords</HI>; and may therefore say

safely, what the <HI>Jews</HI> spake factiously, that <HI>We have no King but Caesar</HI>: the greatest <HI>Prince</HI> here is sub∣ject with us to the same law; and we stand before the Tribunal of the <HI>Judge</HI>: we acknowledge no difference: here do we inhabit our own houses, plow our own lands, enjoy the fruits of our la∣bour▪ comfort our selves with the Wives of our youth; and see our selves grow up in those Chil∣dren which shall inherit after us the same felicities.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving abundantly stifled our spirits in the stink of <HI>Paris,</HI> on Tuesday being the 12. of <HI>June,</HI> we took our leave of it, and prepared our selves to entertaine the sweet aire and winde of
<PB N="258" REF="130"/>
<HI>Orleans.</HI> The day faire, and not so much as di∣sposed to a cloud, save that they began to gather about noon, in the nature of a Curtaine, to defend us from the injury of the Sun; the winde rather sufficient to fan the aire, then to disturb it, by qua∣lifying the heat of that celestiall fire, brought the day to an excellent mediocrity of temper. You would have thought it a day meerly framed for that great <HI>Princesse Nature</HI> to take her pleasure in, and that the Birds which cheerfully gave us their voices from the neighbouring bushes, had been the lowd musick of her Court; in a word, it was a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y solely consecrated to a pleasant journey, and he that did not put it to that use mis-spent it. Ha∣ving therefore put our selves into our Waggon, we took a short farewell of <HI>Paris,</HI> exceeding joy∣full that we yet lived to see the beauty of the fields againe, and enjoy the happinesse of a free Heaven. The Countrey, such as that part of the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>France</HI> towards <HI>Normandy,</HI> onely that the Corne fields were larger and more even: On the left hand of us we had a side-glance of the <HI>Royall</HI> house of <HI>Boys,</HI> and <HI>Vincennes,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Bifectre,</HI> and about some two miles beyond them, we had a sight also of a new house lately built by Mr. <HI>Sillerie Chancellor</HI> of the Kingdome, a pretty house it pro∣mised to be, having two base Courts on the hither side of it, and beyond it a Parke, an ornament, whereof many great mansions in <HI>France</HI> are altoge∣ther ignorant.</P>
<P>Foure leagues from <HI>Paris</HI> is the town of <HI>Mont∣l'herrie</HI>; now old and ruinous, and hath nothing in it to commend it, but the carkasse of a Castle; without
<PB N="259" REF="130"/>
it, it hath to brag of a large and spacious plaine, on which was fought that memorable battaile between <HI>Lewis</HI> the 11. and <HI>Charles le Hardie Duke</HI> of <HI>Bur∣goyne.</HI> A battaile memorable onely for the run∣ning away of each Army, the Field being in a man∣ner emptyed of all the forces, and yet neither of the <HI>Princes victorious. Hic spe celer, ille salute.</HI> Some ran out of fear to dye, and some out of hope to live, that it was hard to say which of the Soldiers made most use of their heels in the combat. This notwithstanding, the <HI>King</HI> esteemed himselfe the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> not that he overcame, but because not vanquisht. He was a Prince of no heart to make a warriour, and therefore Resistance was to him al∣most as much hugged as Victory. It was <HI>Antho∣nies</HI> case in his Warre against the <HI>Parthians,</HI> a Cap∣tain whose <HI>Launce King Lewis</HI> was not worthy to beare after him: <HI>Crassus</HI> before him had been ta∣ken by that people, but <HI>Anthonius</HI> made a retreat though with losse. <HI>Hanc itaque fugam suam, quia victus non exierat, victoriam vocabat,</HI> as <HI>Paterculus</HI> one that loved him not saith of him: yet was <HI>King Lewis</HI> so puffed up with this conceit of victo∣ry, that he ever after sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighted his enemies, and at last ruin'd them, and their cause with them. The Warre which they undertook against him, they en∣tituled, <HI>the Warre of the Weale publick,</HI> because the occasion of their taking Armes was for the li∣berty of the Countrey and the People, both whom the <HI>King</HI> had beyond measure oppressed. True it is, they had also their particular purposes, but this was the main, and failing in the expected event of it, all that they did was to confirme the bondage
<PB N="260" REF="131"/>
of the Realm by their owne overthrow. These <HI>Princes</HI> once disbanded, and severally broken, none durst ever afterwards enter into the action: for which reason King <HI>Lewis</HI> used to say that he had brought the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France Hors Pupillage</HI> out of their Wardship: a speech of more Brag than Truth. The people I confesse he brought into such terms of slavery, that they not long merited the name of Subjects: but yet for this great boast, the <HI>Nobles</HI> of <HI>France</HI> are the <HI>Kings Guardians.</HI> I have already shewn you much of their potencie, by that you may see, that the <HI>French Kings</HI> have not yet sued their <HI>Outre le maine,</HI> as our Lawyers call it. Had he also in some measure broken the powerableness of the <HI>Princes,</HI> he had then been perfectly his word's Master; and till that be done, I shall think his Successors to be in their <HI>Pupillage.</HI> That <HI>King</HI> is but half himselfe, which hath the absolute com∣mand onely of half his people.</P>
<P>The Battaile by this towne, the common peo∣ple impute to the <HI>English</HI>; and so do many others, which they had no hand in: for hearing their <HI>Gran∣dames</HI> talk of their Warres with our Nation, and of the many Fields which we gained of them, they no sooner heare talk of a pitch'd Field, but pre∣sently (as the nature of men in a fright is) they at∣tribute it to the <HI>English.</HI> Good simple soules, <HI>Qui nos non solum laudibus nostris ornare velint, sed alie∣nis onerare:</HI> as <HI>Tullie</HI> in his <HI>Philippicks.</HI> An hu∣mour just like unto that of little children, who be∣ing once afrighted with the Tales of <HI>Robin Good-fellow,</HI> do never after heare any noyse in the night, but they streight imagine, that it is he which maketh

it, or like the women of the villages neere <HI>Oxford</HI>; who having heard the tragicall story of a Duck or a Hen killed and carried to the <HI>Ʋniversity,</HI> no sooner misse one of their chickins, but instantly they cry out upon the <HI>Schollars.</HI> On the same false ground also, hearing that the <HI>English</HI> whilst they had possessions in this Countrey were great builders, they bestow on them without any more adoe, the foundation and perfecting of most of the Churches and Castles in the Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. Thus are our Ancestors said to have built the Churches of <HI>Roven, Amiens, Bayon,</HI> &amp;c. as also the Castles of <HI>Boys,</HI> S. <HI>Vincennes,</HI> the <HI>Bastile,</HI> the two little Forts on the River side by the <HI>Louvre</HI> at S. <HI>Germaines</HI>▪ and amongst many others this of <HI>Montl'herrie,</HI> where we now are, and all alike. As for this Castle, it was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt during the reigne of King <HI>Robert, Anno</HI> 1015. by one of his servants named <HI>Thebald,</HI> long before the <HI>English</HI> had any poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions in this Continent. It was ra∣zed by <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Grosse,</HI> as being a harbourer of Rebells in former times, and by that meanes as a strong bridle in the mouth of <HI>Paris</HI>; nothing now standing of it save an high Tower, which is seen a great distance round about, and serveth for a Land∣mark.</P>
<P>Two leagu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s from <HI>Montl'herrie</HI> is the twon of <HI>Chastres,</HI> seated in the farthest angle of <HI>France,</HI> where it confineth to <HI>la Beauss,</HI> a town of an ordi∣nary size, somewhat bigger than for a market, and lesse than would beseem a city. A wall it hath and a ditch, but neither serviceable further than to re∣sist the enemy at one gate, while the people run away by the other. Nothing else remarkable in it,
<PB N="262" REF="132"/>
but the habit of the <HI>Church</HI> which was <HI>mourning</HI> for such is the fashion of <HI>France,</HI> that when any of the <HI>Noblesse</HI> are buried, the Church which entombeth them is painted black within and without for the breadth of a yard, or thereabouts, and their coats of Armes drawn on it. To goe to the charges of hanging it round with cloath is not for their profits. Besides, this countefeit sorrow feareth thieves, &amp; dareth out-brave a tempest. He for whom the Church of <HI>Chastres</HI> was thus apparelled, had been <HI>Lord</HI> of the Towne, by name as I remember Mr. <HI>St. Bennoist,</HI> his Armes were argent, three Crescents on a Mullet of the same, but whether this Mullet were part of the Coat, or a mark onely of difference I could not learn. Thelike Funerall chur∣ches I saw also at <HI>Tostes</HI> in <HI>Normandie,</HI> and in a Village of <HI>Picardie,</HI> whose name I minde not; <HI>nec operae pretium.</HI> And now we are passed the con∣fines of <HI>France,</HI> a poore River, which for the nar∣rownesse of it, you would think a ditch parting it from the Province of <HI>La Beausse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>La Beausse</HI> hath on the <HI>North, Normandie,</HI> on the <HI>East,</HI> the <HI>Isle of France,</HI> on the <HI>South,</HI> the River of <HI>Loyer,</HI> and on the <HI>West,</HI> the Countreys of <HI>Tou∣rein</HI> and <HI>le Main</HI>; it lieth in 22 &amp; 23 degree of Lon∣gitude, and the 48 and 49 of Latitude, taking whol∣ly up the breadth of the two former, and but part onely of each of the latter. If you measure it for the best advantage of length, you will finde it to ex∣tend from <HI>la Forte Bernard</HI> in the <HI>North west</HI> cor∣ner of it, to <HI>Gyan</HI> in the <HI>South east,</HI> which accor∣ding to the proportion of degrees, amounteth to 60 miles English, and somewhat better; for breadth
<PB N="263" REF="132"/>
it is much after the same reckoning. The ancient inhabitants of this Province, and the reason of the name I could not learn amongst the people; nei∣ther can I find any certainty of it in my books, with whom I have consulted. If I may be bold to goe by conjecture, I should think this countrey to have been the seat of <HI>Bellocassi,</HI> a people of <HI>Gaule Cel∣tick,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Caesar</HI> in his Commentaries. Certaine it is that in this Tract they were seated, and in likelihood in this <HI>Province</HI>; the names an∣cient and moderne being not much different in sense, though in sound. For the <HI>Franks</HI> called that which in <HI>Latine</HI> is <HI>pulcher</HI> or <HI>bellus,</HI> by the name of <HI>Bell</HI> in the Masculine Gender; <HI>Beu</HI> the Pronoune it, and <HI>Beau</HI> as it were the Faeminine. At this time <HI>Beau</HI> is Masculine, and <HI>Belle</HI> Faeminine: so that the name of <HI>Bellocassi</HI> is but varied into that of <HI>Beausse</HI>: Besides that <HI>Province</HI> which the <HI>Roman</HI> writers stile <HI>Bellovaci,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> now call <HI>Beauvais,</HI> where <HI>Belle</HI> is also turned into <HI>Beau.</HI> Adde to this, that the <HI>Latine</HI> writers doe terme this contrey, <HI>Bello Bessia,</HI> where the ancient <HI>Bello</HI> is still preserved; and my conjecture may be pardoned, if not approved. As for those which have removed this people into <HI>Normandie,</HI> and found them in the city of <HI>Baieux,</HI> I appeale to any understanding man, whether their peremptory sentence, or my submisse opinion be the more allowable.</P>

<P>The same night we came to <HI>Estampes,</HI> a towne
<PB N="264" REF="133"/>
scituate in a very plentifull and fruitfull Soile, and watered with a River of the same name, stored with the best Crevices; it seemeth to have been a town of principall importance, there b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing five walls and gates in a length, one before another. So that it appeareth to be rather a continuation of many townes together than simply one. The Streets are of a large breadth, the Buildings for sub∣stance are stone, and for fashion as the rest of <HI>France.</HI> It containeth in it five Churches, whereof the principall is a <HI>Colledge</HI> of <HI>Chanons,</HI> as that of <HI>No∣stredame,</HI> built by King <HI>Robert,</HI> who is said also to have founded the <HI>Castle,</HI> which now can scarcely be visited in its ruines; without the towne they have a fine green Meadow daintily seated within the circlings of the Water, into which they use to fol∣low their recreations. At my being there, the sport was dancing, an exercise much used by the <HI>French,</HI> who doe naturally affect it. And it seems this natural inclination is so strong and deep rooted, that neither age, nor the absence of a smiling for∣tune can prevaile against it. For on this Dancing-green there assembleth not onely Youth and Gen∣try, but also Age and Beggery, old wives which could not set foot to ground without a Crutch in the streets, had here taught their feet to amble, you would have thought by the cleanly conveyance and carriage of their bodies, that they had beene troubled with the <HI>Sciatica,</HI> and yet so eager in the sport, as if their dancing-dayes should never be done. Some there were so ragged, that a swift Galliard would almost have shaked them into na∣kednesse, and they also most violent to have their

carcasses directed in a measure. To have attempted the staying of them at home, or the perswading of them to work when they heard the Fiddle, had been a task too unweildy for <HI>Hercules.</HI> In this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xture of age and condition did we observe them at their pastime; the raggs being so interwoven with the silks, and wrinkled browes so interchangably mingled with fresh beauties, that you would have thought it to have been a mummery of fortunes; as for those of both sexes which were altogether past action, they had caused themselves to be carried thither in their chaires, and trod the measures with their eyes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inne</HI> which we lay in was just like those of <HI>Normandie,</HI> or at the least so like, as was fit for Si∣sters, for such Guests take them.

All the difference in them lay in the morning, and amongst the maid-servants, for there we were not troubled with such an importunate begging, as in that other countrey. These here had learned a more neat and compendious art of getting money, and petitioned not our eares, but our noses, by the <HI>Rhe∣torick of a Poësie</HI>; they prevailed upon the purse, by giving each of us a bundle of dead flowers tacked together, seemed rather to buy our bounties than to beg them. A sweeter and more generous kinde of craving, than the other of <HI>Normandie,</HI> and such as may seem to imply in it some happy contradicti∣on; for what else is it, that a maid should proffer
<PB N="266" REF="134"/>
her self to be deflowred without prejudice to her modesty, and raise to her future husband an honest stock by the usury of a kindenesse. Refreshed with these favours, we took our leave of <HI>Estampes</HI> and the dancing Miscelanie, jogging on through many a beautifull field of corne, till we came unto <HI>Anger∣ville,</HI> which is six leagues distant: a Town of which I could not observe or heare any thing memorable, but that it was taken by <HI>Montacute,</HI> Earle of <HI>Sa∣lisbury,</HI> as hee went this way to the siege of <HI>Or∣leans,</HI> and indeed the taking of it was no great mi∣racle, the walls being so thin that an arrow could almost as soon make a breach in them as a canon. The same fortune befell also unto <HI>Toury,</HI> a place not much beyond it in strength or bignesse, onely that it had more confidence (as <HI>Savage</HI> an <HI>English Gentleman</HI> once said) in the walls of bones, which were within it, than in the walls of stones which were without it.</P>
<P>This Town standeth in the middle way betwixt <HI>Estampes</HI> and <HI>Orleans,</HI> and therefore a fit stage to act a dinner on, and to it we went: by that time we had cleared our selves of our pottage, there entred upon us three uncouth fellowes with hats on their heads, like cover'd dishes; as soon as ever I saw them, I cast one eye upon my cloak, and the other on my sword, as not knowing what use I might have of my steele to maintain my <HI>cloath.</HI> There was great talk at that time of Mr. <HI>Sonbise</HI>'s being in armes, and I much feared that these might be some straglers of his army; and this I suspected by their countenances, which were very thievish and full of insolence. But when I had made a survey
<PB N="267" REF="134"/>
of their apparell, I quickly altered that opinion, and accounted them as the excrement of the next prison, deceived alike in both my jealousies, for these pretty parcels of mans flesh were neither bet∣ter nor worse, but even arrant fidlers, and such which in <HI>England</HI> we should not hold worthy of the whipping post. Our leave not asked, and no reve∣rence on their parts performed, they abused our eares with a harsh lesson; and as if that had not been punishment enough unto us, they must needs adde unto it one of their songs; by that little <HI>French</HI> which I had gathered, and the simpering of a <HI>Fille de joy</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> who came along with us, I percei∣ved it was bawdy, and to say truth, more than pati∣ently could be endured by any but a <HI>French-man,</HI> but <HI>quid facerem,</HI> what should I doe but endure the mi∣sery, for I had not lagu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge enough to call them rogues handsomely, and the villaines were inferiour to a beating, and indeed not worthy of mine or any honest mans anger.

They were a knot of Rascalls so infinitely below the severity of a Statute, that they would have discredi∣ted the <HI>State,</HI> and to have hanged them had been to hazard the reputation of the Gallows. In a yeare you would hardly finde out some vengeance for them, which they would not injure in the suffering; unlesse it be not to hearken to their ribaldry, which is one of their greatest torments.

<P>Amongst the Ancients I have met with three kindes of <HI>Musick, viz.</HI> First, that which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which consisted altogether of long notes or <HI>Spondees,</HI> which was the gravest and saddest of all the rest, called by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> in the last Chapter of his <HI>Politicks,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or morall, because it setled the affections: <HI>Boetius</HI> whom we account the classicall Author in this faculty, called it <HI>Ly∣dian,</HI> because in much use with those of that Na∣tion at this day: We may call it <HI>Italian,</HI> as being generally a peculiar musick to that people. This is the <HI>Musick</HI> which <HI>Elisha</HI> called for, to invite unto him the spirit of Prophesie, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 3.15. and this is it which is yet sung in our Churches. A practice which we derive from the Ancients (however some of late have opposed it) and which is much commended by Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> this be∣ing the use of it, <HI>Ʋt per oblectamenta aurium in∣firmior animus in pietatis affectum assurgat.</HI> The se∣cond kinde the <HI>Artists</HI> call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which con∣sisteth of a mixture of long and short notes, or of the <HI>Dactylus.</HI> The Philosopher termeth it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. being it had been in much esteem amongst the <HI>Dores,</HI> a <HI>Greek Nation:</HI> we may now call it <HI>English,</HI> as being that <HI>Musick</HI> with which our Na∣tion is particularly affected. This is that Musick,
<PB N="269" REF="135"/>
which cheereth the spirits, and is so soveraign an <HI>Antidote</HI> to a minde afflicted, and which, as the <HI>Poet</HI> hath it, doth <HI>Saxa movere sono.</HI> The third sort is, that which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, consisting al∣together of short notes, or <HI>Tribracches.

In these times we may call it <HI>French,</HI> as most delighted in by the stirring spirits, and lightness of this Nation, a note of Musick forbidden unto youth by <HI>Aristo∣tle</HI> and <HI>Plato,</HI> and not countenanced by any of them, but on the common theatres, to satisfie the rude manners and desires of the <HI>vulgar,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and to give them also con∣tent in their recreations, yet is this Musick altoge∣ther in use in this Countrey; no lesson amongst their profest Musicians that I could hear which had any gravity, or solid Art shewed in the Composi∣tion. They are pretty fellowes, I confesse, for the setting out of a <HI>Mask</HI> or a <HI>Coranto,</HI> but beyond this nothing, which maketh the Musick in their Churches so base and unpleasing, so that the glory of perfect Musick at this time, lyeth between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI>; that of <HI>France</HI> being as triviall as their behaviour, of which indeed it is a conco∣mitant. <HI>Mutata Musica mutantur mores,</HI> saith <HI>Tullie,</HI> and therefore he giveth us this lesson, <HI>Cu∣randum itaque est, ut musica quam gravissima &amp; sedatissima retineatur.</HI> A good <HI>item</HI> for the <HI>French.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE are now come into the countrey of <HI>Or∣leans,</HI> which though within the limits of <HI>La Beausse,</HI> will yet be accounted an intire Coun∣ty of it selfe, it is a dainty and pleasant Region, very even and large in the fields of it, insomuch that we could not see a hill or swelling of the ground within <HI>eye-reach.</HI> It consisted of an indifferent mea∣sure of <HI>Corne,</HI> but most plentiful of <HI>Vines,</HI> and hath of all other Fruits a very liberall portion. Neither is it meanly beholding to the <HI>Loyre</HI> for the benefits is receiveth by that River, on which the
<PB N="271" REF="136"/>
City of <HI>Orleans</HI> it selfe is sweetly seated. Of all places in <HI>England, Worcester-shire</HI> in my opinion cometh most nigh it, as well in respect of the Coun∣trey, as the scituation of the Towne: for certainly that Countrey may be called the <HI>Epitome of En∣gland,</HI> as that of <HI>France.</HI> To the richest of the Corn-fields of <HI>Orleans</HI> we may compare the Vale of <HI>Evesham.</HI> Neither will it yeild for choyce and variety of Fruits, the Vine onely excepted. The Hedges in that Countrey are prodigall and lavish of those trees, which would become the fairest Orchards of the West, and in a manner recom∣penceth the want of Wine by its plenty of <HI>Perry</HI> and <HI>Syder.</HI> In a word, what a good Writer hath said of one, we may say of both, <HI>Coelum &amp; sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m ita propitium habent, ut salubritate &amp; ubertate vici∣nis non concedunt.</HI> But the resemblance betweene the townes is more happy; both seated on the se∣cond <HI>River</HI> of note in their severall <HI>Countreys</HI>; and which are not much unlike in their severall courses. <HI>Severn</HI> washing the walls of <HI>Gloucoster,</HI> and pas∣sing nigh unto <HI>Bristoll,</HI> seated on a little Rivulet, and its Homager divideth the ancient <HI>Britaines</HI> from the rest of the <HI>English.</HI> The <HI>Loyre</HI> gliding to the city <HI>Tours,</HI> and passing nigh unto <HI>Angiers,</HI> sea∣ted also within the land on a little River, and one of its Tributaries, separateth the modern <HI>Bri∣taines</HI> from the rest of the <HI>French. Posita est in loco modice acclivi, ad flumen, quod turrigero ponti conjungitur, &amp; muro satis firmo munita,</HI> saith Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> of <HI>Worcester. Orleans</HI> is seated on the like declivitie of an hill, hath its bridge well forti∣fied with Turrets, and its walls of an equall ability
<PB N="272" REF="137"/>
of resistance; <HI>Sed decus est ab incolis qui sunt nume∣rosi &amp; humani, ab aedificiorum nitore, à templorum numero &amp; maxime à Sede Episcopali,</HI> saith he of ours in genrall; we may see it fitly applied to this in each particular. The people of this town are not of the fewest, no town in <HI>France</HI> (the propor∣tion of it considered) being more populous: for standing in so delicate an Aire, and on so commo∣dious a River, it inviteth the <HI>Gentry</HI> or <HI>Noblesse</HI> of the countrey about it to inhabite there, and they accept it. Concerning their behaviour and huma∣nity, certainly they much exceed the <HI>Parisians,</HI> I was about to say all the <HI>French-men,</HI> and indeed I not grudge them this <HI>Eulogie,</HI> which <HI>Caesar</HI> giveth unto those of <HI>Kent,</HI> and verifie that they are <HI>omnium incolarum longe humanissimi,</HI> my selfe here obser∣ving more courtesie and affability in one day, than I could meet withall in <HI>Paris,</HI> during all my abode there. The buildings of it are very suitable to themselves, and the rest of <HI>France</HI>; the streets large and well kept, not yeilding the least offence to the most curious nostrill: <HI>Parish Churches</HI> it hath in it 26. of different and unequall beeing, as it useth to be in other places; besides these, it containeth the <HI>Episcopall Church</HI> of S. <HI>Croix,</HI> and divers other houses of religious persons, amongst which is St. <HI>Jacques</HI>; of both which I shall speak in their due order. Thus much for the resemblance of the Townes, the difference betwixt them is this, that <HI>Orleans</HI> is the bigger, and <HI>Worcester</HI> the richer. <HI>Orleans</HI> consisteth much of the <HI>Noblesse,</HI> and of So∣journers; <HI>Worcester</HI> of <HI>Citizens</HI> and Home-dwel∣lers; and for the manner of life in them, so it is
<PB N="273" REF="137"/>
that <HI>Worcester</HI> hath the handsomer woman in it, <HI>Orleans</HI> the finer, and in my opinion the loveliest in all <HI>France. Worcester</HI> thriveth the most on <HI>Cloa∣thing, Orleans</HI> on their <HI>Vine-presses.</HI></P>
<P>And questionlesse the Wine of <HI>Orleans</HI> is the greatest riches, not of the Towne onely, but of the <HI>Countrey</HI> also about it. For this cause <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dre dis Chesne</HI> calleth it, <HI>the prime Cellar of Paris, Est une pars</HI> (saith he) <HI>si henreuse &amp; si secunde sur tout in vins quon la pent dice l'unde primiers celiers de Paris.</HI> Those Vines wherein he maketh it to be so happy, deserve no lesse a commendation than he hath gi∣ven them, as yeilding the best Wines in all the Kingdome, such as it much moved me to mingle with Water, they being so delicious to the Palate, and the <HI>Epicurisme</HI> of the taste. I have heard of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Gentleman, who being in <HI>Italy</HI> was brought acquainted with a kinde of Wine which they there call <HI>Lachrymae Christi</HI>; no sooner had he tasted it, but he fell into a deep melancholy; and after some seaven sighes, besides the addition of two gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes, he brake out into this patheticall Ejacu∣lation: <HI>Dii boni, quare non Christus lachrymatus esset in nostris regionibus</HI>? This <HI>Dutchman</HI> and I were for a time both of one minde, insomuch that I could almost have picked a quarrell with <HI>Nature,</HI> for giving us none of this <HI>Liquor in England</HI> At last we grew friends, again, when I had perceived how offensive it was to the brain (if not well qualified) for which cause it is said, that K. <HI>Lewis</HI> hath bani∣shed it his Cellar, no doubt to the great grief of his drinking Courtiers, who may therefore say with <HI>Martial,</HI>

<P>This towne called <HI>Genabum</HI> by <HI>Caesar,</HI> was re∣edified by <HI>Aurelian</HI> the <HI>Emperour, Anno</HI> 276. and called by his name <HI>Aurelianum,</HI> which it still re∣taineth amongst the <HI>Latines.</HI> It hath been famous heretofore for four <HI>Councels</HI> here celebrated; and for being the seat royall of the <HI>Kings of Orleans</HI>: though as now I could not heare any thing of the ruines of the <HI>Palace.</HI> The same of it at this time consisteth in the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> and its seat of <HI>Justice</HI>: This town being one of them which they call <HI>Sie∣ges Presidiaux.</HI> Now these <HI>Seiges Presidiaux, Seats</HI> or <HI>Courts of Justice,</HI> were established in divers ci∣ties of the Realme for the ease of the people, <HI>Anno</HI> 1551. or thereabouts. In them all civill causes not exceeding <HI>250 Liu'res</HI> in Money, or 10. <HI>Liu'res</HI> in Rents, are heard and determined soveraignly and without appeale. If the summe exceed those pro∣portions the appeale holdeth good, and shall be examined in that Court of Parliament, under whose jurisdiction it is. Their Court here consisteth of a <HI>Baille,</HI> whose name is Mr. <HI>Digion,</HI> of twelve <HI>Coun∣sellors,</HI> two <HI>Lieutenants,</HI> one <HI>civill,</HI> the other <HI>cri∣minall,</HI> and a publique <HI>Notarie.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Le Compte de St. Paul,</HI> who is the Governour or Lieu∣tenant Generall of the Province cometh into their Court, he giveth precedency to the <HI>Baille,</HI> in other places he receiveth it. This institution of these <HI>Pre∣sidiall Courts,</HI> was at first a very profitable ordi∣nance, and much eased the people, but now it is
<PB N="275" REF="138"/>
grown burdensome. The reason is, that the offi∣ces are meere sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able, and purchased by them with a great deale of money, which afterwards they wrest againe out of the purses of the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sant. The sale of Offices drawing necessarily after it, the sale of <HI>Justice,</HI> a mischief which is spread so far, that there is not the worst <HI>under Officer</HI> in all the Realm Who may not say with the <HI>Captaine</HI> in the 22. of the Acts and the 28. verse, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>With a great summe of money obtained I this freedome.</HI> Twenty yeares purchase is said to be no extraordinary rate; and I have read, that onely by the sale of Offices one of the <HI>Kings</HI> had raised in twenty yeares 139 <HI>millions,</HI> which amounteth to the proportion of 7 <HI>millions</HI> yearly, or thereabouts, of all wayes to thrift and treasure the most unkindly. In the yeare 1614. the <HI>King</HI> motioned the abolishing of the sales of this Market, but it was upon a condition more prejudi∣ciall to the people than the mischiefe. For he desi∣red in lieu of it to have a greater imposition laid upon <HI>Salt,</HI> and upon the <HI>Aides,</HI> which those that were <HI>Commissioners</HI> for the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmonalty</HI> would not admit of, because then a common misery had been brought out of the State, to make their particular miseries the greater, and so the corruption remain∣eth unaltered.</P>
<P>This Towne as it is sweetly seated, in respect of the aire, so is it finely convenienced with the walks, of which the chief are, that next unto <HI>Paris gate,</HI> having the wall on the one hand, and a rank of <HI>Palm</HI> trees on the other; the second, that neere unto the bridge, having the Water pleasingly run∣ning
<PB N="276" REF="139"/>
on both sides: and a third which is indeed the principall, on the <HI>East-side</HI> of the <HI>City,</HI> it is called the <HI>Palle Malle,</HI> of an exercise of that name much used in this Kingdome, a very Gentleman-like sport, not over violent, and such as affordeth good opportunity of discourse, as they walk from one mark to the other. Into this walk, which is of a wonderful length and beauty▪ you shall have a clear evening empty all the towne, the aged people bor∣rowing legs to carry them, and the younger armes to guide them. If any young Dame or <HI>Monsieur</HI> walk thither single, they will quickly finde some or other to link with them, though perhaps such with whom they have no familiarity. Thus do they mea∣sure and re-measure the length of the <HI>Palle Malle,</HI> not minding the shutting in of the day, till dark∣ness hath taken away the sense of blushing; at all houres of the night, be it warm and dry, you shall be sure to finde them thus coupled; and if at the yeares end there be found more children in the towne than fathers, this walk and the night are shrewdly suspected to be accessories; a greater in∣cnovenience in mine opinion, than an <HI>English Kiss.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet a fourth walk in this towne, called <HI>L'estappe,</HI> a walk principally frequented by <HI>Mer∣chants,</HI> who here meet to confer of their occasi∣ons. It lieth before the house of Mr. <HI>Le Comte de St. Paul,</HI> the Governour, and reacheth up to the <HI>Cloister</HI> of <HI>St. Croix:</HI> of the buildings of which <HI>Church</HI> I could never yet hear or read of any thing, but that which is meerly fabulous: for the <HI>Citizens</HI> report, that long since, time out of minde, there ap∣peared a <HI>Vision</HI> to a <HI>holy Monk,</HI> which lived therea∣bouts,
<PB N="277" REF="139"/>
and bad him dig deep in such a place, where he should finde a piece of the <HI>Holy Crosse,</HI> charging him to preserve that blessed relique in great ho∣nour, and to cause a <HI>Church</HI> to be built in that place where it had been buried. Upon this warning the Church was founded, but at whose charges they could not inform me: so that all which I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d learn concerning the foundation of this Church, is, that it was erected by Superstition &amp; a Lie. The Superstition is apparent in the worshipping of such rotten sticks, as they imagine to be the remnants of the <HI>Crosse</HI>: their calling of it holy, and dedicating of this <HI>Church</HI> unto it. Nay they have consecrated unto it two <HI>Holy-dayes,</HI> one in <HI>May,</HI> and the other in <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> and are bound to salute it as often as they see it in the streets, or high wayes, with these words, <HI>Ave salus totius Seculi, arbor salutifera.</HI> Hor∣rible blasphemy, and never heard of but under <HI>An∣tichrist, Cruces subeundas esse non adorandas,</HI> being the lesson of the <HI>Ancients.</HI> As for the Miracle I ac∣count it as others of the same stamp, equally false and ridiculous.

<P>This <HI>Church</HI> is the Seat of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> who ac∣knowledgeth the <HI>Archbishoprick</HI> of <HI>Seines</HI> for his <HI>Metropolitan.</HI> The present <HI>Bishop</HI> is named <HI>Fran∣ciscus de Anbespins,</HI> said to be a worthy Scholar, and a sound <HI>Polititian</HI>; though he were never gradu∣ated farther than the <HI>Arts</HI>: of his revenue I could learn nothing, but of his privileges this, namely, that at the entrance of every new <HI>Bishop</HI> into this <HI>Church,</HI> he hath the liberty of setting free of any of the Prisoners of the Gaole, though their crime be never so mortall. For the originall of this in∣dulgence we are beholding to St. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnan,</HI> once <HI>Bishop</HI> here, and who defended the city against <HI>Atella</HI> the <HI>Huanne</HI>: At his first entrance into the towne (saith the Story) after he was invested <HI>Bi∣shop,</HI> he besought <HI>Agrippinus</HI> the <HI>Governor</HI> that for his sake he would let loose all his Prisoners; <HI>Ʋt omnes quos pro variis criminibus poenalis car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er deti∣nebat inclusos, sibi in introitus gratiam redderet re∣solutos:</HI> When the <HI>Governour</HI> had heard this re∣quest, he denied it, and presently a stone falleth on his head, no man knew from whence.

For the truth of this story I intend to be no <HI>Champion,</HI> for I hold it ri∣diculous, and savouring too much of the <HI>Legend</HI>; but this I am certain of, that every new <HI>Bishop</HI> maketh a solemn and majestick entry into the City, and at his entry releaseth a Prisoner.</P>
<P>Let us follow the <HI>Bishop</HI> into his Church, and we shall finde him entertained with an high <HI>Masse,</HI> the ceremonies whereof are very pretty and ab∣surd; To goe over them all would require a vo∣lume, I will therefore mention those onely, where∣in they diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from other <HI>Masses</HI> and they are two, the one Fantasticall, the other Heathenish; for as soon as the <HI>Priest</HI> at the <HI>Altar</HI> hath read a certain lesson, but what, his voyce was not audible enough to tell me, out marcheth the <HI>Dean,</HI> or in his ab∣sence the senior <HI>Chanoin</HI> out of the <HI>Church</HI>; before him two or three Torches, and a long <HI>Crosse</HI> sil∣vered over; after him all those of the <HI>Church,</HI> and lastly, the <HI>Lay-people</HI> both men and women, so that there is none left to keep possession, but the <HI>Priest</HI> at the <HI>Altar,</HI> and such strangers as come thither for curiosity; they went out at one door, and just circuited the Quire, and the body of the Church, afterwards they return to their places, and the <HI>Priest</HI> proceedeth; I have seen many a dumb shew in a Play just like it. This onely is the difference, that here we had no interpreter nor <HI>Chorus</HI> afforded us to shew us the mysterie of this silent je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iculation. The other addition which I ob∣served here at the <HI>Masse</HI> (though I have since been told, that it is ordinrary at <HI>High Masses</HI> in <HI>Cathe∣drall

Churches</HI>) was the <HI>censing</HI> of the people, which was performed in this manner: Whiles the <HI>Priest</HI> was busie at the <HI>Altar,</HI> there entred into the <HI>Quire</HI> at a side door, two Boyes in their Surplices bearing waxe Tapers in their hands, and immediately after them the foresaid fellow with the <HI>Crosse.</HI> In the rare there came two of the <HI>Priests</HI> in their <HI>Copes,</HI> and other stately vestments, between both a young lad with the Incense pot, made full of holes to let out the fume, which he swinged on all sides of him, with a chain to which it was fastned: Having thus marched through the <HI>Church,</HI> and censed the people, he ascended unto the <HI>Altar,</HI> &amp; there censed the <HI>Cross,</HI> the <HI>Reliques,</HI> the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> the <HI>Chalice,</HI> the <HI>Images</HI>▪ and I know not what not. A custome very much used amongst the <HI>Heathen: Omnibus vicis factae sunt statuae, &amp; ad eas thus &amp; cerei,</HI> saith <HI>Tully:</HI> and <HI>Jane tibi primùm thura merumque fero,</HI> saith <HI>Ovid</HI> in his book <HI>de Fastis</HI>; so have we in <HI>Martiall, Te primùm pia thura rogent,</HI> and the like in divers other writers of the <HI>Antients.</HI> At what time it crept into the Churches of the Christians, I can∣not tell.

<P>For her first service she taketh <HI>Jargean,</HI> discom∣fiteth the <HI>English</HI> which were in it, and maketh the <HI>Earl of Suffolk</HI> Prisoner: soon after followed the battaile of <HI>Patay,</HI> in which the <HI>English</HI> were driven out of the field, and the great <HI>Talbot</HI> taken. This done, she accompanieth <HI>Charles</HI> the 1. whose <HI>Angell-Guardian</HI> she was thought, all <HI>Champayne</HI> unto <HI>Rhemes,</HI> where she solemnly saw him Crowned, all the Townes of those Countreyes yeelding upon the approach of her, and the <HI>Kings</HI> Army. Finally, after many acts performed above the nature of her sexe, which I will not stand here to particulate: she was taken prisoner at the siege of <HI>Campaigne</HI> delivered over unto the <HI>Earle of Bedford</HI> by him sent unto <HI>Roven</HI> and there burnt for a <HI>Witch</HI> on the sixth of <HI>July Anno</HI> 1431. There was also another crime objected against her, as namely that she had abused the nature of her sexe, marching up and downe in the habit of a man; <HI>&amp; nihil muliebre p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aeter corpus gerens,</HI> of all accu∣sations the most impotent, for in what other habit could she dresse her selfe, undertaking the actions
<PB N="284" REF="143"/>
of a General: and besides, to have worne her womans weeds in time of battaile, had been to have betrayed her safety, and to have made her selfe the marke of every Arrow. It was therefore requisite, that she should array her selfe in compleat harness, and in that habit of compleat armour have those of <HI>Orleans,</HI> erected those <HI>statua's</HI> all in brasse, upon the middle of their bridge.</P>
<P>As for that other imputation of being a <HI>Witch,</HI> saving the credit of those that condemned her, and theirs also, who in their writings have so repor∣ted her, I dare be of the contrary opinion, for dividing her actions into two parts, those that precede her coming unto <HI>Orleans,</HI> and those that followed it, I find much in it of valour, somewhat perhaps of cunning, but nothing that is divelish; her relieving of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and courage shewn at the battaile of <HI>Patay</HI> and <HI>Gargean,</HI> with the conducting of the King unto <HI>Rhemes,</HI> are no such prodigies, that they need to be ascribed unto <HI>Witchcraft</HI>: She was not the first woman whom the world knew famed in armes, there being no Nation almost of the Earth, who have not had a Champion of this sexe to defend their liberties: to omit the whole Nation of the <HI>Amazon's,</HI> to the <HI>Jewes</HI> in the time of their afflictions, the <HI>Lord</HI> raised up a Salvation by meanes of two women, <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Judith:</HI> And <HI>God</HI> is not the <HI>God</HI> of the <HI>Jewes</HI> onely, but also of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Amongst the <HI>Sirvans, Zeno∣bia,</HI> Queen of <HI>Palmira</HI> is very famous: the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> (whom she often foiled) never mentioning her without honour. The like commendable testi∣mony they give of <HI>Velleda,</HI> a Queen amongst the

<HI>Germanes,</HI> and a woman which much hindered their affaires in that Countrey: thus had the <HI>Gothes</HI> their <HI>Amalasunta,</HI> the <HI>Assyrians</HI> their <HI>Semiramis</HI> the <HI>Scythians</HI> their <HI>Tomyres</HI>; the <HI>Romans</HI> their <HI>Fla∣via,</HI> and brave Captaines, and such as posterity hath admired without envie. To come home unto our selves, the writers of the <HI>Romans</HI> mention the revolt of <HI>Britaines</HI> and the slaughter of 70000 Confederates to the <HI>Romans,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Vocudia</HI>: and she in the beginning of her encou∣ragements to the action telleth the people thus, <HI>Solitum quidem Britannis foeminarum ductu bellare.</HI> Of all these Heroicall <HI>Ladyes,</HI> I read no accusation of witchcraft; innative courage, and a sense of injury, being the armes they fought withall. Nei∣ther can I see why the <HI>Romans</HI> should exceed us in modesty, or that we need envie unto the <HI>French</HI> this one female Warriour: when it is a fortune which hath befallen most nations. As for her at∣chievements, they are not so much beyond a com∣mon being, but that they may be imputed to natu∣rall meanes. For had she been a <HI>Witch,</HI> it is likely she would have prevented the disgrace which her valour suffered in the ditches of <HI>Paris</HI>; though she could not avoid those of <HI>Champeigne</HI> who took her prisoner. The <HI>Divell</HI> at such an exigent only being accustomed to forsake those which he hath intan∣gled; so that she enjoyed not such a perpetuity of faelicity, as to entitle her to the <HI>Divells</HI> assistance, she being sometimes conquerour, sometimes over∣throwne, and at last imprisoned. <HI>Communia for∣tune ludibria,</HI> the ordinary sports of <HI>Fortune</HI>; her actions before her March to <HI>Orleans</HI> having some∣what in them of cunning and perhaps of impo∣sture,

as the <HI>Vision</HI> which she reported to have in∣cited her to these attempts; her finding out of the <HI>King</HI> disguised in the habit of a Countrey-man, and her appointing to her selfe an old sword, hanging in Saint <HI>Katharines Church in Tours.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> were at this time meerly cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t-fallen, not to be rai∣sed but by a miracle. This therefore is invented, and so that which of all the rest must prove her a sorce∣resse, will onely prove her an impostor. <HI>Gerrard seigneur de Haillan,</HI> one of the best writers of <HI>France</HI> is of opinion, that all that plot of her coming to the <HI>King,</HI> was contrived by three <HI>Lords</HI> of the Court to hearten the people, as if <HI>God</HI> now miraculously intended the restauration of the <HI>Kingdome.</HI> Add to this, that she never commanded in any battaile, without the assistance of the best Captaines of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, and amongst whom was the Ba∣stard of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who is thought to have put this device into her head. The Lord <HI>Bellay</HI> in his dis∣course of Art Military, proceedeth further, and maketh her a man, onely thus habited: <HI>Pour fair revenir le courage aux Francois,</HI> which had it been so, would have been discovered at the time of her burning. Other of the later <HI>French Writers</HI> (for those of the former age savour too much of the <HI>Legend</HI>) make her to be a lusty <HI>lasse</HI> of <HI>Lorreine,</HI> trained up by the <HI>Bastard</HI> of <HI>Orleans</HI> and the <HI>Seig∣neur</HI> of <HI>Brandicourt,</HI> only for this service &amp; that she might carry with her the reputation of a <HI>Prophe∣tesse,</HI> and an <HI>Ambassadresse</HI> from Heaven, Admit this, and farewell <HI>Witchcraft.</HI> As for the sentence of her Condemnation, and the confirmation of it by the <HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> it is with

<P>I Have now done with the Town and City of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and am come to the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> or <HI>Schooles of Law</HI> which are in it, this being one of the first places in which the Study of the <HI>Civil Law</HI> was received in <HI>Europe</HI>; for immediately after the death of <HI>Justinian,</HI> who out of no lesse than two thousand volumes of <HI>Law-Writers,</HI> had collected that body of the <HI>Imperiall Laws,</HI> which we now call the <HI>Digest,</HI> or the <HI>Pandects,</HI> the study of them grew neglected in these <HI>Westerne</HI> parts: nor did any for a long time professe or read them. The reason was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause <HI>Italy, France, Spaine, England</HI> and <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> having received new <HI>Lords</HI> over them, as the <HI>Franks, Lombards, Saxons, Sarcens,</HI> and others, were faine to submit themselves to their <HI>Lawes.</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="146"/>
It happened afterwards that <HI>Lotharius Saxo</HI> the <HI>Emperour,</HI> who began his Raigne <HI>Anno</HI> 1126, being 560 yeares after the death of <HI>Justinian,</HI> having taken the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Melphy</HI> in <HI>Naples,</HI> found there an old Copy of the <HI>Pandects.</HI> This he gave to the <HI>Pisans</HI> his Confederates, as a most reverend re∣lique of Learning and Antiquity, whence it is cal∣led <HI>Litera pisana.</HI> Moreover he founded the <HI>Ʋni∣versity</HI> of <HI>Bologne,</HI> or <HI>Bononia</HI> ordaining the <HI>Civill Law,</HI> to be profest therein, <HI>Wernir</HI> being the first <HI>Professor</HI>; upon whose advice the said <HI>Emperour</HI> ordained, that <HI>Bononia</HI> should be <HI>Legum &amp; Juris Schola una &amp; sola,</HI> and here was the first time and place of that study in the <HI>Westerne Empire.</HI> But it was not the fate onely of the <HI>Civill Lawes</HI> to be thus neglected, all other parts of Learning, both <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Languages</HI> were in the same desperate Estates. The <HI>Poets</HI> exclamation, <HI>O coelum insipiens &amp; infacetum,</HI> never being so appliable as in those times, for it is with the knowledge of good <HI>Let∣ters</HI> as it is in the effects of <HI>Nature</HI>; they have their times of growth alike, of perfection and of death like the Sea, it hath its ebbs as well as its flouds; and like the Earth, it hath its Winter, wherein the seeds of it are deaded, and bound up, as well as a Spring wherein it re-flourisheth. Thus the learning of the <HI>Greeks</HI>▪ lay forgotten, and lost in <HI>Europe,</HI> for 700 yeares, even unto <HI>Emanuel Chry∣solarus</HI> taught it at <HI>Venice,</HI> being driven out of his owne <HI>Countrey</HI> by the <HI>Turks.</HI> Thus the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of <HI>Aristotle</HI> lay hidden in the moath of dust and <HI>Libraries; Et nominabatur potiùs quam legebatur,</HI> as <HI>Ludovicus Vives</HI> observeth in his notes.

<P>But to return to the <HI>Civill Law,</HI> after the foun∣dation of the <HI>Ʋniversity of Bologne,</HI> it pleased <HI>Phi∣lip le Belle</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> to found another here at <HI>Orleans</HI> for the same purpose, <HI>Anno</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>12. which was the first school of that profession, on this side the mountaines; this is evident by the Bull of <HI>Cle∣ment</HI> the fifth, dated at <HI>Lyons</HI> in the yeare 1367. where he giveth this title; <HI>Fructiferum Ʋniversi∣tatis Aurelianum sis inter caetera Citramontana stu∣dia prius, solennius, antiquius, tam Civilis, quam Canonicae facultatis studium.</HI> At the first there were instituted eight <HI>Professors,</HI> now they are re∣duced unto four onely, the reason of this decrease being the increase of <HI>Ʋniversities:</HI> the place in which they read their Lectures is called, <HI>Les grands Escoles,</HI> and that part of the City, <HI>La Ʋniversitie,</HI> neither of which attributes it can any way merit: <HI>Colledges</HI> they have none, either to lodge the <HI>Stu∣dents,</HI> or to entertaine the <HI>Professors</HI>; the former sojourning in divers places of the Town, these last in their severall houses. As for their places of reading, which they call <HI>Les grands Escoles,</HI> it is onely an old Barne converted into a School, by the addition of five rankes of Formes, and a Pew in the middle; you never saw any thing so mock its own name: <HI>Lucus</HI> not being of more people called so, <HI>à non lucendo,</HI> then this ruinous house is, the <HI>great School,</HI> because it is little.

<P><HI>Money</HI> makes the man, saith the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>En∣glish proverb.</HI> That of one of the <HI>Popes</HI> (I remember not suddenly his name) who openly protested, that he would give the orders of <HI>Priesthood</HI> to an <HI>Asse,</HI> should the <HI>King of England</HI> commend an <HI>Asse</HI> unto him, may be most appositely spoken of them. The exercise which is to be performed before the degree taken, is very little, and as trivially performed. When you have chosen the <HI>Law,</HI> which you mean to defend, they will conduct you into an old rui∣nous chamber, they call it their <HI>Library</HI>; for my part I should have thought it to have been the <HI>Ware∣house</HI> of some <HI>second hand Bookseller:</HI> those few books which were there, were as old as Printing, and could hardly make amongst them one cover to resist the violence of a <HI>Rat.</HI> They stood not up end∣long, but lay one upon the other, and were joyned together with <HI>Cobwebs</HI> instead of strings; he that would ever gesse them to have been looked into since the long reigne of Ignorance, might justly have condemned his own charity.

by those of the Towne; it is his office to admit of the young comers, to receive the moneyes due at their admission, and to receive an account of the dispending of it, of the <HI>Questor,</HI> and the expiring of his charge.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Orleans</HI> not an University, till the coming of the Jesuits. Their Colledge there, by whom built. The Jesuits not Singers. Their laudable and exact Method of teaching. Their Policy in it. Received not without great difficulty into <HI>Paris.</HI> Their houses in that University. Their strictnesse unto the Rules of their order. Much maliced by the other Priests and Friers. Why not sent into <HI>England</HI> with the Queen. And of what order they were that came with her. Our returne to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe difference between an <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> and an <HI>Academy</HI> standing thus; those which lived in our Fathers dayes, could hardly have called <HI>Or∣leans</HI> an <HI>Ʋniversity</HI>: a <HI>Shoole</HI> of <HI>Law</HI> being the name most fit for it. At this time, since the coming of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> that appellation may not misbecome it; they having brought with them those parts of Learning, which before were wanting in it▪ but that hath not been of any long standing, their <HI>Colledge</HI> being yet not fully finished: By an <HI>Inscri∣ption</HI> over the gate, it seemeth to be the work of Mr. <HI>Cagliery,</HI> one of the <HI>Advocates</HI> in the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> a man of large practise, and by the consequence, of great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possessi∣ons, and who having no child but this Colledge, is
<PB N="298" REF="150"/>
said to intend the fastening of his estate upon it. In this house doe those of this order apply themsevles to the study of good <HI>Letters</HI>; in the pursuit where∣of, as the rest of this <HI>Fraternity</HI> are, they are good proficients, and much exceed all other sorts of <HI>Friers,</HI> as having better teachers, and more leisure to learn. That time which the other spend at their <HI>High Masses,</HI> and at their <HI>Canonicall houres,</HI> these men bestow upon their books, they being exempted from those duties by their order. Upon this ground they trouble not their heads with the <HI>Crotchets</HI> of <HI>Musick,</HI> nor spend their mouthes up∣on the chanting out of their Services: they have other matters to employ their braines upon, such as are the ruine of <HI>Kingdoms</HI> &amp; desolation of <HI>Coun∣treys.</HI> It was the saying of <HI>Themistocles,</HI> being re∣quested to play a Lesson on the <HI>Lute, That he could not fiddle, but he could tell how to make a little Town a great City.</HI> The like may we say of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> they are no great singers, but are well skilled in making little <HI>cities</HI> great, and great ones little: and certaine it is, that they are so farre from any ability or desire this way, that upon any of their solemne Festivals, when their Statutes require <HI>Mu∣sick,</HI> they are faine to hire the Singing men of the next <HI>Cathedrall,</HI> as here upon the feast of their <HI>Pa∣tron</HI> St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> being the 22. of <HI>July;</HI> they were compelled to make use of the voyces of the church of S. <HI>Croix.</HI></P>
<P>To this advantage of leisure is added the exact method of their teaching, which is indeed so excel∣lent, that the <HI>Protestants</HI> themselves in some pla∣ces send their sons to their <HI>Schooles,</HI> upon desire to
<PB N="300" REF="151"/>
have them prove exquisite in those arts they teach. To them resort the Children of the rich as well as of the poor, and that in such abundance, that wheresoever they settle; other houses become in a manner desolate, or frequented only by those of the more heavy and phlegmatick constitutions. Into their Schooles when they have received them, they place them in that forme or <HI>Classe,</HI> into which they are best fitted to enter. Of these <HI>Classes</HI> the lowest is for <HI>Grammar</HI>; the second for the com∣position or making of <HI>Themes,</HI> as we call it; the third for <HI>Poetrie,</HI> the fourth for <HI>Oratory,</HI> the fifth for <HI>Greeke Grammar</HI> and Compositions; the sixth for <HI>Poesie</HI> and <HI>Rhetorick</HI> of that Language; the seventh for <HI>Logick</HI>; and the eighth and last for <HI>Phi∣losophy.</HI> In each of these Schools there is a severall Reader, or Institutor, who onely intendeth that art, and the perfection of it, which for that yeare he teacheth. That yeare ended, he removeth both himselfe and Schollars with him into the <HI>Classes</HI> or Schoole next beyond him, till he hath brought them through the whole study of humanity. In the last Forme, which is that of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> he continueth two yeares, which once expired, his Scholars are made perfect in the Universality of Learning, and themselves are manumitted from their <HI>Tutors,</HI> and permitted their private Studies. Nor doe they onely teach their Scholars an exictnesse in those severall parts of Learning which they handle: but they also endeavour to breed in them an obstinacy of minde, and a sturdy eagernesse of spirit, to make them thereby hot prosecutors of their own opini∣ons, and impatient of any contrary consideration:
<PB N="301" REF="151"/>
This it is which maketh all those of their education to affect <HI>Victory</HI> in all their controversies of Wit and Knowledge, with such a violence, that even in their very <HI>Grammaticall disputations,</HI> you shall find little boyes maintain arguments with such a fierce impatience, that you would think it above the na∣ture of years; and all this they perform freely, and for nothing: the poore Paisants sonne being by them equally instructed with that of the <HI>Noblesse.</HI> By this meanes they get into their Society great honour and great strength: Honour in furnishing their Schooles with so many persons of excellent quality, or nobility, of whom afterwards they make their best advantages for their strength also: As for those of the poorer sort, they have also their ends upon them; for by this free and liberall edu∣cation of their <HI>children,</HI> the common people doe infinitely affect them; besides that, out of that rank of their Scholars, they assume such into their Fraternity, whom they finde to be of a rare wit, an excellent spirit, or any other way fitted for their profession.</P>
<P>Thus do they make their owne purpose out of all conditions, and refuse no fish which either they can draw into their nets, or which will offer it selfe unto them. <HI>Si locuples quis est, avari sunt; si pauper ambitiosi: quos non oriens non occidens satiaverit, soli omnium opes atque in piam opur affectu concu∣piscunt. Galgacus</HI> a British Captaine spake it of the Souldiers of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> we may as justly verifie it of these Souldiers of the <HI>Roman Church:</HI> they being the men whom neither the <HI>East</HI> nor <HI>West Indies</HI> can satisfie, and who with a like fer∣vency
<PB N="302" REF="152"/>
desire the education of the needy and the wealthy. Moreover, by this method of teaching they do not onely strengthen themselves in the af∣fections of men abroad, but also fortifie themselves within their owne walls at home; for by this meanes there is not one of their society who hath perfectly concocted in his head the whole <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of knowledge, but hath gained unto him∣self the true art of speaking, and readinesse of ex∣pressing what he knoweth, without the least de∣mur or hesitancie; the greatest happinesse of a <HI>Scholer.</HI> To conclude then, and say no more of them &amp; their abilities (for <HI>virtus &amp; in hoste probatur</HI>) it is thought by men of wisdome and judgement, that the planting of a <HI>Colledge of Jesuits</HI> in any place, is the onely sure way to re-establish that Religion which they professe, and in time to eat out the con∣trary.</P>
<P>This notwithstanding they were at the first institu∣tion of them rightly opposed, &amp; no where more v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣olently than in the University of <HI>Paris.</HI> An Ʋniversity that standeth much upon its liberties &amp; privileges, to which this order was imagined to be an hindrance, it being lawfull for them to take any degree in their owne houses without reference to any pub∣lique exercise or examination. In the year 1554. at which time they first began to set foot in <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Colledge</HI> of the <HI>Sorbonists</HI> made a long Decree against them: in the end whereof are these words, and they are worth the reading, <HI>Videtur haec societas in negotio fidei periculosa, pacis &amp; Ecclesiae pertur∣bativa, Monasticae religionis eversiva, &amp; magis ad destructionem quam ad aedificationem.</HI> A <HI>censure</HI> too
<PB N="303" REF="152"/>
full of vinegar and bitternesse: Afterwards in the yeare 1564. they preferred a Petition to the <HI>Ʋni∣versity,</HI> that the <HI>Colledge</HI> which the <HI>Bishop of Cler∣mont</HI> had built for them, might be incorporated in∣to the <HI>Ʋniversity,</HI> and every the immunities of it: Upon the <HI>Ʋniversities</HI> deniall of their desire, there arose a suit between them and the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> in the <HI>High court of Parliament, Peter Versories</HI> plea∣ding for the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and <HI>Steven Pasquier</HI> for the other party: in the end they were admitted, though upon terms of wonderfull strictnesse. <HI>Anno</HI> 1594. <HI>John Chastell</HI> of <HI>Novice</HI> of this order, having wounded King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth in the mouth, oc∣casioned the banishment of this Society out of all <HI>France.</HI> Into which they were not againe received till the yeare 1604. and then also upon limitations more strict than ever. Into <HI>Paris</HI> they were not re-admitted untill <HI>Anno</HI> 1606. neither had they the liberty of reading Lectures, and instructing the Youth, confirmed unto them untill <HI>Anno</HI> 1621. which also was compassed not without great trou∣ble and vexation.</P>
<Q><L>Per varios casus &amp; tot discrimina rerum,</L>
<L>as <HI>Aeneas</HI> and his companions came into <HI>La∣tium.</HI></L></Q>
<P>In this <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> they have at this instant three <HI>Houses,</HI> one of <HI>Novices,</HI> a second of <HI>Institutors,</HI> which they call the <HI>Colledge,</HI> and a third of profes∣sed <HI>Jesuits,</HI> which they stile their <HI>Monastery,</HI> or the <HI>professed House</HI> of St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> In their house of <HI>Novices</HI> they traine up all those whom they have
<PB N="304" REF="153"/>
called out of their Schooles, to be of their order, and therein imitate them in the art of <HI>Jesuitisme,</HI> and their mysteries of iniquity. There they teach them not <HI>Grammaticall</HI> construction, or compositi∣on, but instruct them in the paths of Vertue, Cou∣rage, and Obedience, according to such examples as their <HI>Authors</HI> afford them. But he that made the Funerall Oration for <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1610. reported otherwise: <HI>Latini Sermonis obten∣tu</HI> (saith he) <HI>impurissime Gallicae juventutis mores ingenuos foedant: Bonarum artium praetextu, pessimas edocent artes; Dum ingenia excolunt, animas perdunt,</HI> &amp;c. In their <HI>College</HI> they have the same method of teaching, which the others of their company use in <HI>Orleans.</HI> A <HI>Colledge</HI> first given unto them by Mr. <HI>William Prat,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Clermont,</HI> whose House it was, but much beautified by themselves after his de∣cease; for with the money which he gave unto them by his Will, which amounteth (as it was thought) to 60000. Crowns; they added to it the <HI>Court</HI> called <HI>de Langres,</HI> in S. <HI>James</HI>'s street; <HI>An.</HI> 1582. Their <HI>Mo∣nastery,</HI> or house of prayer or <HI>profession,</HI> is that unto which they retire themselves, after they have dis∣charged their duties in the <HI>College,</HI> by reading and studying publickly in their severall <HI>Classes</HI>; when they are here, their study both for time and quali∣ty, is <HI>ad placitum,</HI> though generally their onely stu∣dy in it, is <HI>Policy,</HI> and the advancing of their cause. And indeed out of this <HI>Trojan Horse</HI> it is that those firebrands and incendiaries, are let out to disturb, and set in combustion the affaires of <HI>Christendome.</HI> Out of this Forge come all those Stratagems, and tricks of <HI>Machiavillianisme</HI> which
<PB N="305" REF="153"/>
tend to the ruine of the <HI>Protestants</HI> &amp; the desolation of their Countries. I speak not this of their house of <HI>Profession</HI> here in <HI>Paris,</HI> either onely or princi∣pally; wheresoever they settle, they have a House of this nature, out of which they issue to overthrow the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Being once sent by their superiours, a necessity is laid upon them of obedience, be the imployment never so dangerous; and certainly this nation doth most strictly obey the rules of their order of any whosoever, not excepting the <HI>Capu∣chins,</HI> nor the <HI>Carthusians.</HI> This I am witnesse un∣to, that whereas the <HI>Divinity Lecture</HI> is to end at the tolling of a Bell, one of the Society in the <HI>College</HI> of <HI>Clermont,</HI> reading about the fall of the <HI>Angells,</HI> ended his Lecture with these words, <HI>De∣nique in quibuscunque</HI>; for then was the warning given, and he durst not so farre trespasse upon his rule, as to speak out his sentence.</P>
<P>But it is not the fate of these <HI>Jesuites</HI> to have great persons onely, and <HI>Ʋniversities</HI> to oppose their fortunes, they have also the most accomplisht malice, that either the <HI>Secular Priests,</HI> or their friends amongst whom they live, can fasten upon them. Some envy them for the greatnesse of their possessions, some because of the excellency of their Learning; some hate them for their power; some for the shrewdnesse of their braines; all together making good that saying of <HI>Paterculus,</HI> that <HI>Sem∣per eminentis fortunae comes est invidia.</HI> True in∣deed it is, that the <HI>Jesuites</HI> have in a manner de∣served all this clamor and stomack by their own insolencies, for they have not onely drawne into their owne hands all the principall affaires of <HI>Court</HI>
<PB N="306" REF="154"/>
and <HI>State,</HI> but upon occasions cast all the storme and contempt they can, upon those of the other Or∣ders. The <HI>Janizaries</HI> of the <HI>Turke</HI> never more neglectfully speak of the <HI>Asapi,</HI> than these doe of the rest of the <HI>Clergie.</HI> A great crime in those men who desire to be accounted such excellent Masters of their owne affections. Neither is the affection borne to them abroad, greater then that at home; amongst those, I mean, of the opposite party, who being so often troubled and frumped by them, have little cause to afford them a liking, and much lesse a welcome. Upon this reason they were not sent into <HI>England</HI> with the <HI>Queen,</HI> although at the first they were destinate to that purpose. It was well known how odious that name was among us, and so little countenance the <HI>Court</HI> or Countrey would have afforded them. They therefore that had the governance of that businesse, sent hither in their places the <HI>Oratorians</HI> or <HI>Fratres Congregationis. Ora∣torii</HI> were a race of men never as yet offensive to the <HI>English,</HI> further than the generall defence of the <HI>Romish</HI> cause, and so lesse subject to envie and exception. They were first entituled by <HI>Philip Nerius,</HI> not long after the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and advanced and dignified by <HI>Pope Sixtus</HI> the fifth, principally for this end, that by their incessant Sermons to the People of the lives of <HI>Saints,</HI> and other <HI>Ec∣clesiasticall antiquitie,</HI> they might get a new repu∣tation, and so divert a little the torrent of the peo∣ples affections from the <HI>Jesuits. Baronius,</HI> that great and excellent <HI>Historian</HI>; and <HI>Bozius</HI> that deadly enemy to the soveraignty of <HI>Princes,</HI> were of the first foundation of this new order.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="154"/>I have now done with <HI>Orleans</HI> and the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and must prepare for my returne to <HI>Paris,</HI> which journey I began the 13. of <HI>July,</HI> and ended the day following. We went back the same way that we came, though we were not so fortunate as to enjoy the same company we came in formerly: Instead of the good and acceptable society of one of the <HI>French Noblesse,</HI> some Gentlemen of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> and two <HI>Friers</HI> of the Order of S. <HI>Austin,</HI> we had the perpetuall vexation of foure Tradesmen of <HI>Paris,</HI> two <HI>Fulles de Joy,</HI> and an old Woman. The <HI>Artizans</HI> so slovenly attired, and greazy in their apparell, that a most modest apprehension could have conceived no better of them, than that they had been newly raked out of the Scullery: one of them by an inkhorne that hung by his side, wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have made us believe that he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Notary</HI>▪ bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the thread of his discourse, we found out that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a <HI>Sumner</HI>; so full of <HI>Ribaldry</HI> was it, and so rankly did it savour of the <HI>French Bawdy court</HI> The rest of them talked according to their skill concerning the price of Commodities; and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was the most likely man of all the <HI>City</HI> to be made one of the next yeares <HI>Eschevins</HI>: Of the two Wenches, one so extremely impudent, that even an immodest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are would have abhorred her lan∣guage, and of such a shamelesse deportment, that her very behaviour would have frighted Lust out of the most incontinent man living.

In a word, she was a wench borne to shame all the <HI>Friers</HI> with whom she had traffiqued; for she would not be <HI>Casta,</HI> and could not be <HI>Cauta</HI>; and so I leave her.

woman so old, that I am not at this day fully re∣solved whether she were ever young or no; 'twas well I had read the Scriptures, otherwise I might have been prone to have thought her one of the first pieces of the Creation, and that by some mis∣chance she had escaped the Floud: her face was for all the world like unto that of <HI>Sybilla Erythraea</HI> in some old print, or that of one of <HI>Solomons</HI> two Harlots in the painted cloth; you would not but have imagined her one of the <HI>Relikes</HI> of the first age after the building of <HI>Babel,</HI> for her very complexi∣on was a confusion more dreadfull than that of Languages; as yet I am uncertain whether the Po∣em of our <HI>Arch-Poet Spencer,</HI> entituled was not purposely intended on her: sure I am it is very appliable in the Title; but I might have saved all this labour: <HI>Ovid</HI> in his description of <HI>Fames,</HI> hath most exactly given us her Portraiture, and out of him and the eighth book of the <HI>Metamorphosis,</HI> you may take this view of her;

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>Ʋly</HI> the twenty seventh having dispatch∣ed that business which brought us into <HI>France,</HI> and surveyed as much of the <HI>Country</HI> as that opportunity would permit us: we began our journey towards <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="158"/>
in a Coach of <HI>Amiens</HI>; better accompanied we were, than when we came from <HI>Orleans</HI>; for here we had Gentlemen of the choisest fashion, very ingenuous, and in mine opinion finer condi∣tioned than any I had met withal, in all my ac∣quaintance with that Nation, and which appeared to me somewhat marvellous, we had no vexation with us in the shape of a <HI>French-woman,</HI> to torment our ears with her discourse, or punish our eyes with her complexion. Thus associated we began to wag on towards <HI>St. Lowp,</HI> where that night we were to be lodged. The <HI>Country</HI> such as already I have described it in the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>France</HI>; save that beyond <HI>St Denis</HI> it began to be somewhat more hilly: by the way I observed those little cressets erected in the memory of <HI>St. Denis</HI> (as being vainly supposed to be his resting places, when he ran from <HI>Mountmartyr</HI> with his head in his hand) which the zealous madness of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> had thrown down, and were now reedifyed by <HI>King Lewis</HI>: It could not but call to mind the hate of that Nation unto that harmless monument of Christs suffering, the <HI>Cross</HI>; which is grown, it seemeth, so exorbitant, that the <HI>Papists</HI> make use of it to discover an <HI>Hugonot.</HI></P>
<P>I remember that as we passed by water from <HI>Amiens</HI> to <HI>Abbeville,</HI> we met in the boat with a berry of <HI>French Gentlewomen.</HI> To one of them, with that little <HI>French</HI> which I had, I applied my self; and she perceiving me to be <HI>English,</HI> questi∣oned my <HI>Religion</HI>: I answered (as I safely might) that I was a <HI>Catholike:</HI> and she for her better sa∣tisfaction proffered me the little <HI>cross</HI> which was

on the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of her beads to kiss: I kissed it, and ra∣the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should I desire to kiss it than many of their lip: thereupon the rest of the company gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome this verdict, that I was <HI>un urai Christien et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> point un Hugonet.</HI> But to proceed to our jour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey.</P>
<P>The same day we parted from <HI>Paris</HI> we passed through the Town of <HI>Luzarch,</HI> and came to that of <HI>St. Lowp.</HI> The first famous onely in its owner, which is the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Soisons</HI>: the second in an <HI>Abbey</HI> there scituate, built in memory of <HI>St. Lu∣pus Bishop of Troyes</HI> in <HI>Campagne.</HI> These Towns passed, we entred into <HI>Picardy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Picardy</HI> is divided into the higher, which con∣taineth the territories of <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Burlogne,</HI> with the Town of <HI>Monstrevelle</HI> and the lower; wherein are the goodly <HI>Cities</HI> of <HI>Amiens, Abeville,</HI> and many other places of principal note. The higher, which is the lesser, and more Northern part, is bounded <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West</HI> with the <HI>English Ocean,</HI> and on the <HI>East</HI> with <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Artoys.</HI> The later, which is the larger, the richer and the more Southern, hath on the <HI>East</HI> the little <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Veromandoys,</HI> on the <HI>West Normandy,</HI> and on the <HI>South</HI> the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Campaigne.</HI> In length it com∣prehendeth all the fifty one degree of <HI>Latitude,</HI> and three parts of the fiftieth, extending from <HI>Cales</HI> in the <HI>North</HI> to <HI>Clermont</HI> in the <HI>South.</HI> In breadth it is of a great inequality: For the higher <HI>Picardy</HI> is like <HI>Linea</HI> amongst the <HI>Logicians,</HI> which they define to be <HI>Longitudo sine Latitudine,</HI> it be∣ing indeed nothing in a manner but a meer bor∣der. The lower is of a larger breadth, and con∣taineth
<PB N="316" REF="159"/>
in it the wole twenty fourth degree of <HI>Longitude,</HI> and a fourth part of the twenty three. So that by the proportion of degrees this pro∣vince is an hundred and five miles long, and seven∣ty five broad.</P>
<P>Concerning the name of <HI>Picardy,</HI> it is a diffi∣culty beyond my reading and my conjecture. All that I can do is, to overthrow the less probable opinions of other Writers; and make my self sub∣ject to the scoffe which <HI>Lactantius</HI> bestoweth on <HI>Aristotle. Recte hic sustulit aliorum disciplinas, sed non recte fundavit suam.</HI> Some then derive it from <HI>Pignan,</HI> one sorsooth of <HI>Alexander</HI> the greats Captains, who they fain to have built <HI>Amiens</HI> and <HI>Pigmingin</HI>; an absurdity not to be honoured with a confutation. Some from the Town of <HI>Pigmin∣gin</HI> it self, of which mind is <HI>Mercator</HI>; but that Town never was of such note as to name a <HI>Pro∣vince.</HI> Others derive it from <HI>Picardus,</HI> a fanatical heretick of these parts, about the year 1300. and after; but the appellation is farre older than the man. Others fetch it from the <HI>Picts</HI> of <HI>Brittanie,</HI> whom they would have to fly hither, after the dis∣comfiture of their <HI>Empire</HI> and <HI>Nation</HI> by the <HI>Scots.</HI> A transmigration of which all Histories are silent: this being the verdict of the best <HI>Antiquary</HI> ever nursed up in <HI>Brittain. Picti itaque praelio funestissimo debellati, aut penitus fuerunt extincti, aut paulatim in Scotorum nomen &amp; nationem concesserint.</HI> Lastly, some others derive the name from <HI>Pigs,</HI> which sig∣nifyeth a <HI>Lance</HI> or <HI>Pike</HI>: the inventors of which warlike Weapon the fathers of this device would fain make them. In like manner some of <HI>Germany</HI>
<PB N="317" REF="159"/>
have laboured to prove, that the <HI>Saxons</HI> had that name given them, from the short Swords which they used to wear, called in their language <HI>Seaxen</HI>: but neither truly: For my part, I have consulted <HI>Ptolomie</HI> for all the Nations, and the <HI>Itinerarium</HI> of <HI>Antonius</HI> for all the Towns in this Tract, but can find none, of which I may fasten any probable <HI>Etymologie.</HI> All therefore that I can say, is that which <HI>Mr. Robert Bishop</HI> of <HI>Auranches</HI> in <HI>Normandy</HI> hath said before me, and that onely in the general: <HI>Quos itaque aetas nostra Picardos appellat, Vere Belgae dicendi sunt, qui post modum in Picardorum nomen transmigrarunt.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Country</HI> is very plentiful of corn and other grain, with which it abundantly furnisheth <HI>Paris</HI>; and hath in it more store of pasture and meadow ground, than I else saw in any part of <HI>France:</HI> In Vines onely it is defective, and that (as it is thought) more by the want of industry in the people, than any inability ih the soyl; for indeed they are a people that will not labour more than they needs must; standing much upon their state and distance, in the carriage of their bodies savou∣ring a little of the <HI>Spaniard</HI>; when <HI>Picardiser,</HI> to play the <HI>Picard</HI> is usually said of those who are lofty in their looks; or gluttonous at their tables: this last being also one of their simptomes of a <HI>Picard.</HI></P>
<P>The Governour of this <HI>Province</HI> is the <HI>Duke les Deguiers</HI>; into which Office he succeeded Mr. <HI>Luynes,</HI> as he also did in that of the <HI>Constable</HI>; two preferments which he purchased at a deer rate, ha∣ving sold or abandoned that Religion to compass
<PB N="318" REF="160"/>
them, which he had professed for more than sixty years together. An Apostasie most unworthy of the man, who having for so many years supported the cause of Religion, hath now forsaken it, and thereby made himself guilty of the cowardice of <HI>M. Antonius, qui cumin desertores saeviri debue∣r at desertor sui exercitus factus est.</HI> But I fear an heavier sentence waiteth upon him; the Crown of immortality not being promised to all those which run, but to those onely which hold out to the end: For the present indeed he hath augmented his ho∣nours. By this Office, which is the principal of all <HI>France,</HI> he hath place and command before and over all the <HI>Peers</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> of the bloud, and at the coronation of the French Kings ministreth the Oath. When the <HI>King</HI> entereth a City in state, or upon the rendition of that, he goeth before with the Sword naked; and when the <HI>King</HI> sitteth in an Assembly of the three <HI>Estates,</HI> he is placed at the <HI>Kings</HI> right hand: he hath command over all his Majesties Forces, and he that killeth him is guilty of high treason: he sitteth also as cheif Judge at the Table of <HI>Marble,</HI> upon all suits, actions, per∣sons and complaints whatsoever concerning the warrs.</P>
<P>This Table <HI>de Marble</HI> was wont to be continu∣ally in the great Hall of the <HI>Palace</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI>; from whence at the burning of that Hall it was removed to the <HI>Louure.</HI> At this Table doth the <HI>Admiral</HI> of <HI>France</HI> hold his Sessions, to judge of traffiick, pri∣zes, Letters of Marts, piracies and business of the like nature. At this Table judgeth all <HI>Le grand Maistre des eaures et Forrests,</HI> we may call him the <HI>Justice</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="160"/>
in <HI>Eire</HI> all his Majesties Forrests and Waters. The actions there handled are thefts and abuses committed in the <HI>Kings</HI> Forrests, Rivers, Parks, Fish-ponds and the like. In the absence of the <HI>Grand Maistre,</HI> the power of sentence resteth in the <HI>Les grands Maistres enquesteures, et gene∣raux reformateurs,</HI> who have under their command no fewer than 300. subordinate Officers. Here also sit the <HI>Marshals</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who are ten in num∣ber, sometimes in their own power, sometimes as <HI>Assistants</HI> to the <HI>Constable,</HI> under whose direction they are: with us in <HI>England</HI> the authority of the <HI>Marshalship</HI> is more entire, as that which besides its own jurisdiction, hath now incorporated in it self most of the matters anciently belonging to the <HI>Constables</HI>: which Office ended in the death of <HI>Edward Lord Duke of Buckingham,</HI> the last here∣ditary and proprietary <HI>Constable</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> This Office of <HI>Constable,</HI> to note unto you so much by the way, was first instituted by <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Gross,</HI> who began his reign <HI>Anno</HI> 1110. and conferred on <HI>Mr. Les Deguiers</HI> on the 24th of <HI>July Anno</HI> 1622. in the Cathedral Church of <HI>Grenoble,</HI> where he first heard <HI>Mass,</HI> and where he was installed <HI>Knight</HI> of both Orders. And so I leave the <HI>Constable,</HI> to take a veiw of his <HI>Province</HI>: A man at this time beloved of neither parties; hated by the <HI>Protestants</HI> as an <HI>Apostata,</HI> and suspected by the <HI>Papists</HI> not to be entire.</P>
<P>To proceed: <HI>July</HI> the twenty eighth we came unto <HI>Clermont,</HI> the first Town of any note that we met with in <HI>Picardy.</HI> A pretty nea Town, and finely seated on the rising of an hill: For the de∣fence
<PB N="320" REF="161"/>
of it, it hath on the upper side of it an indif∣ferent large <HI>Castle,</HI> and such as were the scituations of it, somewhat helped by the strengths of Art, might be brought to good service. Towards the Town it is of an easie access, to the fieldward more difficult, as being built on the pendicular fall of a Rock. In the year 1615. it was made good by <HI>Mr. Haroncourt</HI> with the Regiment of eight Companies, who kept it in the name of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the rest of that Confederacy; but it held not long: For at the <HI>Marshal d' Ancres</HI> coming before it with his Army and artillery, it was presently yeilded. This warr, which was the second <HI>Civil warr</HI> that had happened in the reign of <HI>King Lewis,</HI> was undertaken by the <HI>Princes</HI> chiefly to thwart the designes of the <HI>Queen Mo∣ther,</HI> and to crush the powerableness of her grand favourite the <HI>Marshall.</HI> The pretence (as in such cases commonly is) was the good of the Common∣wealth: the occasion, the cross <HI>Marriages</HI> then consummated by the <HI>Marshal</HI> between the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>: For by those marriages they seemed to fear the augmentation of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> greatness; the alienation of the affections of their ancient Allies, and by consequence the ruine of the <HI>French Empire.</HI> But it was not the fate of <HI>D' Ancre</HI> to perish; two years more of Command and insolencies his <HI>destinies</HI> allowed, and then he tumbled: This opportunity of his death ending the third <HI>Civil war,</HI> each of which his faulty great∣ness had occasioned.</P>
<P>What the ambition of his designs did tend to, I dare not absolutely determine, though like enough
<PB N="321" REF="161"/>
it is, that they aimed further than at a private or personal potency: for having under the favour and countenance of the <HI>Queen Mother,</HI> made him∣self Master of the <HI>Kings</HI> ear, and of his counsels, he made a shift to get into his own hands an au∣thority almost as unlimitted, as that of the old <HI>Mayre</HI> of the <HI>Palace</HI>; for he had suppressed the liberty of the general Estates, and of the <HI>Soveraign Court,</HI> removed all the <HI>Officers</HI> and <HI>Coun∣sellors</HI> of the last <HI>King</HI>: ravished one of the <HI>Presi∣dents</HI> of the great Chamber, by name <HI>Mr. Le Jay,</HI> out of the <HI>Parliament</HI> into the Prison; and plan∣ted Garrisons of his own in most of the good Towns of <HI>Normandy,</HI> of which <HI>Province</HI> he was Governour: Add to this, that he had caused the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde,</HI> being acknowledged the first Prince of the bloud, to be imprisoned in the <HI>Ba∣stile</HI>: and had searched into the continuance of the lives of the <HI>King</HI> and his Brother by the help of sorcery and witchcraft: Besides he was suspected to have had secret intelligence with some forrain <HI>Princes,</HI> ill-willers to the State, and had disgraced some, and neglected others of the <HI>Kings</HI> Confede∣rates: And certainly those actions seem to import some project beyond a private and obedient great∣ness; though I can hardly beleive, that he durst be ambitious of the <HI>Crown</HI>; for being a fellow of a low birth, his heart could not but be too narrow for such an hope, and having no party amongst the Nobility, and being less gratious among the peo∣ple, he was altogether destitute of means to com∣pass it. I therefore am of opinion, that the <HI>Spanish gold</HI> had corrupted him to some project
<PB N="322" REF="162"/>
concerning the enlargement of that <HI>Empire</HI> upon the <HI>French</HI> dominions, which the <HI>cross Marriages</HI> (whereof he was the contriver) and which seem∣ed so full of danger to all the best <HI>Patriots</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> may seem to demonstrate. And again, at that time, when he had put the Realm into this third combustion, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> had an Army on foot against the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and another in the Countries of <HI>Cleive</HI> and <HI>Juliers</HI>; which had not the timely fall of this <HI>Monsieur,</HI> and the peace ensuing prevented it, might both perhaps have met together in the midst of <HI>France:</HI> but this is onely conjectural.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THat night we went from <HI>Clermont</HI> to a Town called <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etaul,</HI> where we were harboured, be∣ing
<PB N="323" REF="162"/>
from <HI>Clermont</HI> six <HI>French</HI> Leagues, and from <HI>Paris</HI> twenty. Our entertainment there such as in other places, as sluttish and as inconvenient. The next day, being the twenty ninth, about ten of the clock we had a sight of the goodly and fair <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Amiens.</HI> A <HI>City</HI> of some <HI>English</HI> miles circuit within the wals, which is all the greatness of it, for without the wals it hath houses few or none. A <HI>City</HI> very capacious, and for that cause hath been many times honoured with the persons and trains of many great <HI>Princes</HI>: Besides that, once it en∣tertained almost a whole Army of the <HI>English.</HI> For <HI>King Lewis</HI> the eleventh having made an advan∣tagious peace with our <HI>Edward,</HI> and perceiving how ingrateful it was amongst the military men, he intended also to give them some manner of sa∣tisfaction: he sent therefore unto them three hun∣dred Carts laden with the best Wines, and seeing how acceptable a present that had proved, he in∣tended also to feast them in <HI>Amiens</HI>; within half a league of which their Camp was lodged. This entertainment lasted four dayes, each street having in it two long tables, and each table being furnish∣ed with very plentiful provision Neither were they denied entrance into any of the Taverns or Victualling-houses, or therein stinted either in meats or drinks, whatsoever was called for, was de∣fraied by <HI>King Lewis.</HI> An action wherein, if my opinion might carry it, there was little of the <HI>Poli∣tician</HI>; for there were permitted to enter into the Town so many of the <HI>English-men</HI> at once, that had they been but so minded, they might easily have made themselves as well Masters of the place, as of
<PB N="324" REF="163"/>
the <HI>Kings person</HI>: nine thousand are reckoned by <HI>Comminees</HI> to have been within together, and most of them armed; so that they might very easily have surprised the Gates and let in the rest of the Ar∣my. Those of the <HI>French Kings Council</HI> feared it much, and therefore informed both <HI>Princes,</HI> the one of his Town, the other of his <HI>honour.</HI> But this jealousie was but a <HI>French</HI> distrust, and might well have been spared: the <HI>English</HI> being of that <HI>Ge∣nerals</HI> mind, that scorned to steal a <HI>Victory,</HI> and of that generous disposition, that they would not betray their credits. <HI>Nunquam illis adeo ulla op∣portuna visa est victoriae occasio, quam damno pensa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent fidei</HI>; as the Historian of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> If then this <HI>City</HI> escaped a sack or a surprisal, it cannot be imputed to the wisdom of the <HI>French,</HI> but to the modesty and fair dealing of the <HI>English:</HI> but this was not the onely <HI>Solaecisme</HI> in point of State com∣mitted by that great <HI>Politick</HI> of his time <HI>King Lewis,</HI> there never being a man so famed for brain, that more grosly over-reached himself, than that <HI>Prince,</HI> though perhaps more frequently.</P>
<P>The buildings of this Town are of divers mate∣rials, some built of stone, others of wood, and some again of both: the streets very sweet and clean, and the air not giving place to any for a lively pureness: Of their buildings the principal are their <HI>Churches,</HI> whereof there are twelve onely in number. Churches, I mean, parochial, besides those belonging unto <HI>Religious Houses.</HI> Next unto them, the work of most especial note, is a great large <HI>Hospital,</HI> in method and disposing of the beds much like unto the <HI>Hostel Dieu</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> but in
<PB N="325" REF="163"/>
number much inferior: <HI>Et me tamen capuerant</HI>: and yet the decency of them did much delight me. The sweetness and neatness of the Town proceed∣eth partly (as I say) from the air, and partly from the conveniencie of the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Some,</HI> on which it is seated: for the River running in one entire bank at the further end of the Town, is there divided into six <HI>Channels,</HI> which almost at an equal distance run through the several parts of it. These Channels thus divided receive into them all the ordure and filth wherewith the Town were other∣wise likely to be pestered, and affordeth the people a plentiful measure of water, wherewith to purge the lanes and by-corners of it, as often as them li∣steth. But this is not all the benefit of these Chan∣nels; they bestow upon the <HI>City</HI> matter also of commodity, which is the infinite number of <HI>Griest-Mils</HI> that are built upon them. At the other end of the Town the Channels are again united into one stream, both those places, as well at the divisi∣on as the union, of the Channels being exceeding∣ly fortified with chains and piles, and also with bul∣warks and out-works.</P>
<P>Neither is the Town well fortified and streng∣thened at those passages onely in the upper parts of it, having enough of strength to enable them to a long resistance. The <HI>Ditch</HI> round about it, save where it meeteth with the <HI>Cittadel,</HI> is exceeding deep and steepy, the wals of a good height, broad and composed of earth and stone equally: the one making up the outside of them, and the other the inside. The Gates are very large and strong, as well in the sinewie composition of themselves, as
<PB N="326" REF="164"/>
in addition of the Draw-bridge. <HI>Subburbs</HI> this <HI>City</HI> hath none, because a Town of Warr, nor any liberal circuit of territoty, because a Frontier: yet the people are indifferent wealthy, and have a∣mongst them good trading, besides the benefit of the Garrison and the Cathedral. The Garrison consisteth of two hundred and fity men (five hun∣dred in all they should be) who are continually in pay to guard the Cittadel: their pay eight Sols daily. The Governour of them is the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Chawne,</HI> who is also the Lieutenant or <HI>Deputy Go∣vernour</HI> of the whole <HI>Province</HI> under the <HI>Consta∣ble.</HI> Their <HI>Captain Mr Le Noyr,</HI> said to be a man of good experience, and worthy his place. This <HI>Cittadel</HI> was built by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth as soon as he had recovered the Town from the <HI>Spaniards, Anno</HI> 1591. It is seated on the lower part of the <HI>City,</HI> though somewhat on the advantage of an hill; and seemeth in my opinion better scituate to command the Town, than to defend it, or rather to recover the Town, being taken, than to save it from taking. They who have seen it, and know the arts of Fortification, report it to be impreg∣nable.

Nor am I able to contradict it: for besides that it is a skill beyond my profession, we were not per∣mitted to come within it, to take a survey of it at a distance: As soon as we approached nigh unto it, one of the Garrison offered us the musket, a

sufficient warning not to be too venterous. So that all I could observe was this, that they had within themselves good plenty of earth to make their gabions and repair their breaches. With the same jealousie also, are the rest of the Forts and Towns of importance guarded in this and other Countries: no people that ever I heard of being so open in shewing their places of strength and safety unto strangers as the <HI>English</HI>: For a dozen of Ale a Forreiner may pace over the <HI>Curtain of Portsmouth,</HI> and measure every sconce and bulwark of it: for a shilling more he shall see their provi∣sion of powder and other munition, and when that is done, if he will, he shall walk the round too. A <HI>French</HI> crown fathometh the wals of <HI>Dover Ca∣stle</HI>; and for a pint of Wine one may see the na∣kedness of the block-houses at <HI>Gravesend.</HI> A negligence which may one day cost us dearly, though now we think it not.

watchmen receive no pay from the <HI>King,</HI> but dis∣charge that duty amongst themselves, and in turns, every house finding one for that service twelve nights in the year: The Weapons which they use are <HI>Pikes</HI> onely and <HI>Musquets,</HI> there being not one peice of Ordinance all about the Town, or on the wals of it. The <HI>Governour</HI> of this Town, as it hath reference to the <HI>King,</HI> is a <HI>Bailly,</HI> who hath belonging unto him all the authority which belongeth to a <HI>Siege Presidial.</HI> Under him he hath a <HI>Lieutenant Generall</HI> and particular; seven <HI>Coun∣sellors,</HI> a publick <HI>Notary,</HI> and other inferior Officers and Magistrates.

<P>Another Circumstance there is which ennobleth this Town of <HI>Amiens,</HI> which is, that it is a <HI>Vise∣damate,</HI> or that it giveth honour to one of the <HI>No∣bility,</HI> who is called the <HI>Visedame</HI> of <HI>Amiens.</HI> This title at this time belongeth to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Chau∣ny,</HI> Governour of the <HI>Cittadel,</HI> together with the <HI>Lordship</HI> of <HI>Pigingin</HI>; both which he obtained by marrying the Daughter and Heir of the last <HI>Vise∣dame</HI> of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Pigingin, Anno</HI> 1619. A marriage which much advanced his fortunes, &amp; which was compassed for him by the <HI>Constable Luynes</HI> his brother, who also obtained for him of the <HI>King</HI> the title of <HI>Duke</HI>: His highest attribute before, being that of <HI>Mr. de Cadinet,</HI> by which name he was known here in <HI>England,</HI> at such time as he was sent extraordinary <HI>Ambassadour</HI> to <HI>King

James.</HI> This honour of <HI>Visedame</HI> is, for ought that ever I could see, used onely in <HI>France.</HI> True it is, that in some <HI>English</HI> Charters we meet with <HI>Vice-Dominus,</HI> as in the <HI>Charter</HI> of <HI>King Edred</HI> to the <HI>Abbey of Crowland</HI> in <HI>Lincoln-shire,</HI> dated in the year 948. there is subscribed, <HI>Ego Bingulph Vice-dominus,</HI> &amp;c. but with us, and at those times, this title was onely used to denotate a subordination to some superior <HI>Lord,</HI> and not as an honorary at∣tribute, in which sense it is now used in <HI>France</HI>: besides that, with us it is frequently, though falsly, used for <HI>Vicecomes</HI>: between which two Offices of <HI>Vicount</HI> and <HI>Vidame</HI> there are found no small re∣semblances: For as they which did <HI>agere Vicem Comitis,</HI> were called <HI>Vicecomites</HI> or <HI>Vicomits,</HI> so were they also called <HI>Vidames,</HI> or <HI>Vice-Domini, qui Do∣mini Episcopi vicem gerebant in temporalibus.</HI> And as <HI>Vicountes</HI> from Offices of the <HI>Earles</HI> became <HI>honorary</HI>; so did the <HI>Vidames</HI> disclaim the relation to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> and became <HI>Seigneural</HI> or <HI>honorary</HI> also.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vidames</HI> then, according to the first institu∣tion, were the substitutes of the greater <HI>Bishops</HI> in matters of secular administration, for which cause, though they have altered their tenure, they take all of them their denomination from the cheif Town of some <HI>Bishoprick</HI>; neither is there any of them, who holdeth not of some <HI>Bishoprick</HI> or o∣ther: Concerning the number of them that are thus dignified I cannot determine. <HI>Mr. Glover,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Sommerset Herald,</HI> in his discourse of <HI>Nobility,</HI> published by Mr. <HI>Miles</HI> of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> putteth it down for absolute, that here are four

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THere is yet one thing which addeth more lu∣stre to the Citie of <HI>Amiens,</HI> than either the <HI>Visdamate,</HI> or the <HI>Cittadel,</HI> which is the Church of <HI>Nostre Dame</HI>: a name by which most of the
<PB N="331" REF="166"/>
principal Churches are known in <HI>France:</HI> there have we the <HI>Nostre Dame</HI> in <HI>Roven,</HI> a second in <HI>Paris,</HI> a third in this <HI>City,</HI> a fourth in <HI>Boulogne,</HI> all <HI>Cathedrall</HI>; so also a <HI>Nostre Dame</HI> in <HI>Abbeville,</HI> and another in <HI>Estampes,</HI> the principal Churches in those Towns also; Had I seen more of their Towns, I had met with more of her Temples; for so of many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have heard, that if there be more than two Churches in a Town, one shall be sure to be dedicated to her, and that one of the fairest. Of any Temples consecrated to the Name and memo∣ry of our <HI>Saviour. Ne gry quidem,</HI> there was not so much as a word stirring; neither could I mar∣vel at it, considering the honours done to her, and those to her <HI>Son</HI>; betwixt which there is so great a disproportion, that you would have imagined that <HI>Mary,</HI> and not <HI>Jesus,</HI> had been our <HI>Saviour</HI>; for one <HI>Pater Noster</HI> the people are enjoyned ten <HI>Ave Maries</HI>: and to recompence one pilgrimage to <HI>Christs</HI> Sepulchre at <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> you shall hear of two hundred undertaken to our <HI>Lady</HI> of <HI>Lo∣retto</HI>: And whereas in their <HI>Kalendar</HI> they have dedicated onely four <HI>Festivals</HI> to our <HI>Saviour,</HI> which are those of his <HI>birth, circumcision, resurre∣ction,</HI> and <HI>ascension,</HI> all which the <HI>English Church</HI> also observeth; for the <HI>Virgins</HI> sake they have more than doubled the number. Thus do they solemnize the feast of her <HI>Purification</HI> and <HI>Annun∣ciation,</HI> at the times which we also do: of her <HI>Vi∣sitation</HI> of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in <HI>July</HI>; of her <HI>Dedication</HI> and <HI>Assumption</HI> in <HI>August,</HI> of her <HI>Nativity</HI> in <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> of her <HI>Presentation</HI> in <HI>November,</HI> and of her <HI>Conception</HI> in the womb of her Mother in <HI>De∣cember.</HI>
<PB N="332" REF="167"/>
To her have they appropriated set forms of prayers prescribed in the two books, called one <HI>Officium,</HI> and the other <HI>Rosarium beatae Mariae Vir∣ginis</HI>: whereas her <HI>Son</HI> must be contented with those Orisons which are in the <HI>Common Mass Book:</HI> her <HI>Shrines</HI> and <HI>Images</HI> are more glorious and magnificent, then those of her <HI>Son,</HI> and in her <HI>Chappel</HI> are more Vows paid, than before the <HI>Cru∣cifix.</HI> But I cannot blame the <HI>Vulgar,</HI> when the great Masters of their souls are thus also besotted. The <HI>Officium</HI> before mentioned, published by the Command of <HI>Pius</HI> the fifth, saith thus of her. <HI>Gaude Maria Virgo, tu sola omnes haereses intermist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in universo mundo. Catherinus</HI> in the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent,</HI> calleth <HI>Fidelissimam Dei sociam</HI>: and he was modest, if compared with others. In one of their <HI>Councils Christs</HI> name is quite forgotten, and the name of our <HI>Lady</HI> put in the place of it, for thus it beginneth: <HI>Authoritate Dei Patris, &amp; beatae Vir∣ginis, &amp; omnium Sanctorum,</HI> &amp;c. but most horrible is that of one of their Writers (I am loath to say it was <HI>Bernard) Beata Virgo monstra te esse Ma∣trem, jube filium:</HI> which <HI>Harding</HI> in his confuta∣tion of the <HI>Apologie,</HI> endeavouring to make good, would needs have it to be onely an excess of mind, or a spiritual sport and dalliance: but from all such <HI>sports</HI> and <HI>dalliances, good Lord deliver us.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving our <HI>Lady,</HI> let us go see her <HI>Church,</HI> which questionless is one of the most glorious piles of building under the Heavens; what <HI>Velleius</HI> saith of <HI>Augustus,</HI> that he was <HI>homo qui omnibus omnium gentium viris inducturus erat caliginem,</HI> or what
<PB N="333" REF="167"/>
<HI>Suetonius</HI> spake of <HI>Titus,</HI> when he called him <HI>Deli∣as humani generis,</HI> both these attributes and more too, may I most fitly fasten on this magnificent structure. The whole body of it is of most curious and polished stones, every where born up by but∣tresses of excellent composure, that they seem to add more of beauty to it than of strength: the <HI>Quire</HI> of it is, as in great Churches commonly it is, of a fairer fabrick than the body, thick set with dainty pillars, and most of them reaching unto the top of it, in the fashion of an <HI>Arch.</HI> I am not well able to judge, whether the Quire of the <HI>Chappel</HI> of <HI>King Henry</HI> the seventh at <HI>Westminster</HI> be the more exquisite piece of <HI>Architecture,</HI> though I am not ignorant, that <HI>Leland</HI> calleth that of our <HI>King, Miraculum Orbis.</HI> I perswade my self, that a most discerning eye could find out but little difference between them, and that difference more subtil than sound: For if such perfections may receive the word of more, it might be said, that there were more majesty in this of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and more loveli∣ness in that of <HI>Westminster</HI>; yet so, that the ones majesty did exceed in loveliness, and the others loveliness excelled in majesty.</P>

<L>Majestas &amp; Amor —</L></Q>
<P>But now we are come unto the divinity of work∣manship, the <HI>Front</HI>; which presenteth it self unto us with two Towers, and three Gates, that in the middle being the principal: the <HI>Fronts</HI> of <HI>Wels</HI> or <HI>Peterborough,</HI> which we so much fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="168"/>
deserve not to be named in the same <HI>Myriad</HI> of years with this of <HI>Amiens</HI>: For here have you al∣most all the sacred Stories engraven so lively, that you would no longer think this story of <HI>Pigmali∣ons</HI> image to be a fable; and indeed at the first sight you would confidently beleive, that the <HI>Histories</HI> there represented were not carved but acted: To say no more of it (for all my abilities will but disgrace it) in the description: that of <HI>Zeuxis</HI> may most fitly be inscribed upon it: <HI>Invi∣sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m facilius aliquem, quam imitaturum:</HI> so infinitely is it above the ambition of imitati∣on.</P>
<P>The outside of the <HI>Church</HI> being so admirable you would have thought that Art and treasure had left nothing of themselves to bestow within it, yet herein would such thoughts deceive you: <HI>No∣stre Dame</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Roven</HI> lay most without; yet here it serveth but as a mask to hide and con∣ceal those more admirable graces which are with∣in. As soon as you are entred, you will suppose that the materials of it are all of gold, such a lustre doth it cast upon the eyes of all those that look upon it: the glory of <HI>Solomons</HI> Temple, next unto the description of it in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> is best read in this <HI>Church</HI>; of which it seemeth to have been the pattern. <HI>Jupiters house</HI> in Heaven, described by the <HI>Poets,</HI> was never half so gorgeous as this on the earth, that therefore which <HI>Ovid</HI> poetically spake concerning that imagery Palace of the false <HI>God,</HI> we most truly verifie of this real Mansion of the true <HI>God.</HI>
<Q><PB N="335" REF="168"/>
<L>Hic locus est, quem si verbis audacia detur</L>
<L>Haud timeam Magni dixisse Palatia Regis.</L></Q>
To instance in particulars, the partition between the <HI>Quire</HI> and the body is so overlaid with gold, that the acutest sight could apprehend no other substance of it, and yet had the art of the work∣man so fully exprest its power on it; that the cost was much inferiour to the workmanship; so curi∣ously was it adorned with excellent imagery, and what else the hand of man could fashion into por∣traiture. On the top of it was the <HI>Statua</HI> of our <HI>Lady,</HI> in the just height and proportion of a wo∣man, all either of gold or gilded, her Child in her arms of the same making.</P>
<P>She was there exprest, as standing in a round circle, unto every part of which she darted ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rayes and beams of gold, just as the <HI>Sun</HI> doth seem to do, when the <HI>Painter</HI> hath drawn him in his full lustre. The glass of the <HI>Church</HI> generally, and par∣ticularly that about the <HI>Quire,</HI> the <HI>Virgins</HI> Chap∣pel is the most full of life and beauty of any that I ever set eye upon: As much as that of <HI>St. Denis</HI> exceedeth ours at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> so much doth this <HI>St. Denis.</HI> But the largest measure of perfection in it is that of the pillars; which though full of majesty in their height and compass, have yet an ornament added to them more majestical than that majesty, for upon each of them (there are four ranks of them in all) are fastened four tables, which take up their whole circuit, every table be∣ing in length two yards or thereabouts: In every of these are the pictures of sundry men and wo∣men
<PB N="336" REF="169"/>
of the better quality, so exactly limmed, that neither a curious eye could desire, or a cunning hand discharge it better. These tables are the monuments and tombs of the <HI>Burgers</HI> of the <HI>City,</HI> or of the <HI>Nobles</HI> of the <HI>Country</HI> nigh unto it, who in them have caused their pictures to be drawn, with as great art and state as cost could procure them, and in a subscription of golden letters have eternized their names, and that art to all succeed∣ing posterity. So that we may justly say of the sumptuousness of this <HI>Church,</HI> what the <HI>Historian</HI> doth of the <HI>Temple</HI> at <HI>Delphos. Multa igitur ibi, &amp; opul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nta regum populorumque visuntus munera, quaeque magnificen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia sui reddentium vota gratans voluntatem magnifestant.</HI> Neither have these se∣pulchral ornaments been of any great standing; the ancientest of them that I could observe, having been erected since the year 1570. Add to these the curious works which the Engraver hath cut in the main wals, and then perhaps you will fall into the same extasie that I did, and pick a quarrel with Nature and the Heavens, that they had not made you all into an eye.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Church,</HI> as in others also of this party, besides the high <HI>Altar</HI> in the midst of the <HI>Quire,</HI> there are divers others in the private <HI>Clossets,</HI> which are destinate to the mumbling of their low <HI>Mas∣ses:</HI> of these here are in number twenty four, all of them seated within the two outermost ranks of pillars and the wals pretty neat pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and it is pitty they should be abused to such <HI>Idolatries.</HI> Of three of them I took especial notice, they being indeed the cheifest of the rest, either for furniture or for
<PB N="337" REF="169"/>
use. The first of them is that of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> which was divided from the <HI>West</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> by a sphere made of wood, which reached unto the top of the partition. On the outside, the Planets, Starrs and Constellations were most artificially set down in their proper Orbes, with the time of ab∣solving their several courses: On the inside those places were filled up with a pack of verses in com∣mendation of our <HI>Lady.</HI> The Alter there was for matter and making the most glorious that ever I yet looked upon: that on the other side in the <HI>Quire,</HI> and over which is the image of our <HI>Savi∣our,</HI> being more despicable than were fit for the credit of a Village. Over this <HI>Altar</HI> was the <HI>Vir∣gins Statua,</HI> all gift, and of a full and womanly proportion: two <HI>Angels</HI> of the same materials attending on her: Finally, this <HI>Chappel,</HI> consider∣ing the richness and glory of it, may be stiled the <HI>Epitome</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>: that attribute of <HI>immensae opulentiae templum,</HI> being no more deservedly ap∣pliable to <HI>Solomons Temple,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> spake it, than to this.</P>
<P>The second of them stood, as I remember, at the further end of the <HI>Church</HI> behind the <HI>Quire,</HI> not directed, for ought I could perceive, to any parti∣cular <HI>Saint</HI>: yet not to be passed over without a due remembrance: It was separated from the rest of the <HI>Church</HI> by two ranks of brass pillars, one rank above the other. The pillars are curiously cast, and such as would not shame rhe workman. In the <HI>massing Closset</HI> over the <HI>Altar</HI> there was hanged a tablet, which by the many lines and sha∣dows drawn in it, seemed to represent some piece
<PB N="338" REF="170"/>
of building. Moving my hand towards my eye, in the nature and kind of a perspective-glass, I perceived to be the representation of that <HI>Church</HI> wherein I stood to see it, and it was done with that cunning, that it would almost have perswaded a man out of himself, and made him beleive, that he had been in the <HI>Church-yard</HI>; so perfectly did it shew the majesty of the <HI>Front,</HI> the beauty of the <HI>Iles,</HI> the number of the <HI>pillars,</HI> and the glory of the <HI>Quire</HI>; a kind of work in my opinion of all others the most excellent, and such as would infinitely delight an <HI>Optick</HI>: Had not such peices been vul∣gar to me, it had more affected me: But in the gallery of <HI>Mr. Crane</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> once belong∣ing to that <HI>humerous Physitian Mr. Butler,</HI> and in that of <HI>Sir Noel Caron</HI> late <HI>Leiger</HI> for the <HI>States</HI> at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> I had seen divers of them, whereof some perfecter.</P>
<P>The third of these <HI>Massing Clossets</HI> was that of <HI>St. Peter,</HI> not so gorgeous as the rest unto the eyes of them that saw it, but more useful to the soules of those who had a mind to take the benefit of it, for therein hung an <HI>Indulgence</HI> granted by <HI>Pope Gregory</HI> the fifteenth unto that <HI>Church,</HI> dated the twenty seventh of <HI>July, Anno Dom.</HI> 1612. and of his <HI>Popedom</HI> the twentieth. The contents of it were, an absolute exemption from the pains and place of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> to those, who upon the Feast of <HI>All-Soules (Festum commemorationis Sanctorum</HI> the <HI>Breif</HI> calleth it) and the <HI>Octaves</HI> of it, would come to pay their devotions and moneys in that Temple. Had the extent of it been general, it would quickly have emptied the <HI>Popes</HI> treasury,
<PB N="339" REF="170"/>
and in time to have put an end to <HI>Purgatory.</HI> His <HI>Holiness</HI> therefore did wisely restrain it in his <HI>Bull</HI> to the natives of that <HI>Diocess.</HI> The author and first founder of those <HI>Indulgences</HI> (if it be lawful to note so much by the way) was <HI>Pope Ʋrban</HI> the second, who began his <HI>Popedom, Anno</HI> 1088. who conferred them on all such who would go into the warrs for the recovering of <HI>Hierusalem:</HI> Next they began to be conferred on those who would side with the <HI>Pope</HI> in his unlawful warrs against the <HI>Emperours.</HI> And lastly, about the time of <HI>Cle∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI> the fifth (he began his raign, <HI>Anno</HI> 1306.) they began to grow merchantable, for to him that gainful invention of the <HI>Church</HI> treasury, consist∣ing of the merits of our <HI>Saviour</HI> and the <HI>Saints,</HI> is imputed: but I return again to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Amiens.</HI></P>
<P>This glorious <HI>Church</HI> is the seat of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> who acknowledgeth for his <HI>Metropolitan</HI> the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Rhemes, Primate</HI> of all <HI>France</HI>: the first <HI>Bishop</HI> of it was one <HI>Firnamus</HI> a native of <HI>Pam∣pelune</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Navarre,</HI> who suffered <HI>Martyrdom</HI> under the <HI>Emperor Dioclesian</HI>: to him succeeded another <HI>Firminus,</HI> to whom the first foundation of this <HI>Church</HI> is attributed: the pre∣sent <HI>Diocesan</HI> is named <HI>Franciscus Faber,</HI> his <HI>intra∣do</HI> about six thousand Crowns a year: <HI>Chanoins</HI> there are in the <HI>Church</HI> to the number of forty, of whose revenue I could not learn any thing.

found a companion, under the tilt we espied a bearie of <HI>Lasses,</HI> mixt with some young Gentle∣men.

The <HI>Castle</HI> scituate on the top of the Hill, is now a place of more pleasure, than strength, as having command over an open and good Country, which lyeth below it; it belon∣geth as we have said, to the <HI>Vidimate</HI> of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and so doth the Town also. This Town is famous among the <HI>French,</HI> for a tradition and a truth. The tradition is of a famous defeate given to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>▪ neer unto it; but in whose raigne, and under
<PB N="342" REF="172"/>
whose conduct, they could not tell us; being thus routed they fled to this Town, into which their enemies followed with them, intending to put them all to the sword: but at last their furie being allayed, they proposed that mercy unto them, which those of <HI>Gilead</HI> did unto those of <HI>E∣phraim</HI> in the <HI>Scriptures</HI>: life and liberty being promised to all them that could pronounce this word <HI>Pignigni</HI>: it seemeth it was not a word in those daies possible for an <HI>English</HI> mouth, for the <HI>English</HI> saying all of them <HI>Peguenie,</HI> instead of <HI>Pignigni,</HI> were all of them put to the sword: thus farre the tradition. The truth of story by which this Town is famous in the writers of both Nations, is an enterviewe there given between our <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and their <HI>Lewis</HI> the ele∣venth, upon the concluding of their nine years truce; a circumstance of no great moment in it self, had not <HI>Phillip de Comminees</HI> made it such by one of his own observations. Upon this meeting the <HI>Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> being <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ely,</HI> made an oration to both <HI>Kings</HI>; beginning with a prophesie, which said that in this place of <HI>Pig∣nigni,</HI> an honourable peace should be concluded between both the <HI>Kingdomes.</HI> On this ground, which himself also is the onely man that related, he hath built two observations: the one (I have not the original by me) that the <HI>English</HI> men are never unfurnished with <HI>Prophesies:</HI> the other that they ground every thing which they speak upon <HI>Prophesies</HI>: How far those times were guilty of that humor I cannot say; though sure I am, we are not the onely men that were so affected: <HI>Pau∣lus
<PB N="343" REF="172"/>

<P>The next place of note which the water con∣veyed us to, was the Town and Castle of <HI>Pont d' Armie,</HI> a place now scarce vissible in the auines: and belonging to one <HI>Mr. Queran</HI>: it took name, (as they said) from a Bridge here built for the transpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation of an <HI>Armie</HI>; but this I cannot justifie: Three Leagues down the River is the Town of <HI>Abbeville</HI>; a Town conveniently seated on the <HI>Some,</HI> which runneth through it. It is of greater circuit within the walls, than the Citie of <HI>Amiens,</HI> and hath four parish Churches more in it, but is not so beautifull nor so populous: for the houses here are of an older stamp: and there is within the Town no scarcity of wast ground: I went round about the walls, and ob¦served the thinness of the houses, and the large∣ness of the fields; which are of that capacity and
<PB N="345" REF="173"/>
extent, that for ought I could apprehend; the Town needs never to be compelled by famine, if those fields were husbanded to the best advan∣tages: the walls are of earth within and stone without: of an unequal bredth and in some pla∣ces rui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous: A <HI>Castle</HI> it once had, of which there is now scarce any thing remaining; instead of which and in places more convenient, they have built out three bastions very large and capacious; and such which well manned, needs not yeeld up on a summons. There are also a couple of <HI>Mounts</HI> raised nigh unto the Wall at that place, where the Country is most plain; upon which good Ordinance would have good command, but at this time there were none upon it: without the wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it is diversly strengthened, having in some places a deep ditch without water; in some a shallower ditch, but well filled with the benefit of the benefit of the <HI>River</HI>: the others only a marish, and fennie levell, more dangerous to the enemie and service to the Town, than either of the rest; and therefore never guarded by the Souldiers of the Garrison: but the chief strength of it is five Companies of <HI>Swisses,</HI> 100. men in a Company, proper tall fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owes in appearance, and such as one would imagine fit for the service: It was my chance to see them begin their watch; to which employment they advanced with so good order and such shew or stomack, as if they had not gone to guard a sown, but possess one. Their watch was at <HI>Port de Boys,</HI> and <HI>Port St. Valery</HI>: the first thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear unto <HI>Hesden</HI> a <HI>frontier</HI> Town of <HI>Artoys</HI>: the other five Leagues only from the See

and Haven of <HI>St. Valery</HI>: from these places most danger was feared, and therefore there kept most of their Souldiers, and all their Ordinance. The <HI>Captain</HI> is named <HI>Mr. Aille</HI> a <HI>Grison</HI> by birth, and reported for a good Souldier: besides him they have no Military Commander: the <HI>Mayor</HI> of the Town, contrary to the common nature of Towns of warre, being there in highest authority: A priviledge granted unto the <HI>Mayors</HI> hereof not long since, as a reward due to one of their Inte∣grities, who understanding that the <HI>Governour</HI> of the Town held intelligence with the <HI>Arch Duke</HI>; apprehended him, and sent him to the Court where he receceived his punishment. This <HI>Ab∣beville</HI> (and so I leave it, and in it the berry of <HI>French Lasses</HI>) is so called <HI>quasi Abbatis Villa,</HI> as formerly belonging to some <HI>Abbot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the last we took post-horse for <HI>Boulogne,</HI> if at least we may call those <HI>Post-horses</HI> which we rode on: As lean they were as <HI>Envis</HI> is in the <HI>Poet: Macies in corporatota,</HI> being most true of them. Neither were they onely lean enough to have their ribs numbred, but the very spur-gals had made such casements through their skins, that it had been no greater difficulty to have surveyed their entrails. A strange kind of Cattel in mine opi∣nion, and such as had neither flesh on their bones, nor skin on their flesh, nor hair on their skin. Sure I am, they were not so lusty as the <HI>Horses</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> in <HI>Ovid</HI>: neither could we say of them, <HI>flammiferis implent hinnitibus aur as</HI>: All the neigh∣ng we could hear from the proudest of them, was onely an old dry cough, which Ile assure you did
<PB N="347" REF="174"/>
much comfort me, for by that noise I first learned there was life in them. Upon such <HI>Anatomies</HI> of Horses, or to speak more properly, upon such se∣veral heaps of bones were I and my company mounted, and when we expected, however they seemed outwardly, to see somewhat of the post in them, my beast began to move after an <HI>Aldermans pace,</HI> or like <HI>Envie</HI> in <HI>Ovid</HI>:
<Q>Surgit humi pigre, passu{que} incedet inerti.</Q>
Out of this gravity no perswasion could work them; the dull jades being grown insensible of the spur; and to hearten them with wands would in short time have distressed the Country. Now was the Cart of <HI>Diepe</HI> thought a speedy convey∣ance, and those that had the happiness of a Wag∣gon were esteemed too blessed, yea, though it came with the hazard of the old woman and the wenches. If good nature, or a sight of their journeys ever did chance to put any of them into a pace like a gallop, we were sure to have them tire in the middle way, and so the remainder of the Stage was to be measured with our own feet: be∣ing weary of this trade, I made bold to dismount the <HI>Postilion,</HI> and ascended the <HI>Trunk Horse,</HI> where I sate in such magnificent posture, that the best Carrier in <HI>Paris</HI> might have envied my felicity: behind me I had a good large Trunk, and a Port∣mantue, before me a bundle of Cloaks, and a par∣cel of Books. Sure I was, that if my stirrups could poize me equally on both sides, that I could not likely fall backwards nor forwards. Thus preferred
<PB N="348" REF="175"/>
I encouraged my Companions, who cast many an envious eye upon my prosperity: and certainly there was not any of them, who might not more justly have said of me, <HI>Tu as un meilleur temps que le pape,</HI> then poor <HI>Lauarillo</HI>'s Master d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, when he allowed him an Onion for four dayes. This cir∣cumstance I confess might have well been omit∣ted, had I not great example for it. <HI>Philip de Comminees</HI> in the midst of his grave and serious relation of the battel of <HI>Mont l' hierrie,</HI> hath a note much about this nature, which gave me encou∣ragement, which is, that himself had an <HI>old Horse half tired</HI> (and this was just my case) who by chance thrust his head into a pail of Wine, and drunk it off, which made him lustier and friskier that day than ever before, but in that his Horse had better luck than I had.</P>
<P>On the right hand of us, and almost in the mid∣dle way betwixt <HI>Abbeville</HI> and <HI>Boulogne,</HI> we left the Town of <HI>Monstreville,</HI> which we had not lea∣sure to see. It seemed daintily seated for com∣mand and resistance; as being built upon the top and declivity of an hill, it is well strengthened with <HI>Bastions</HI> &amp; ramparts on the outside &amp; hath within a Garrison of five Companies of Souldiers: their <HI>Governour</HI> (as I learned of one of the <HI>Paisants</HI>) being called <HI>Lenroy:</HI> And indeed it concerneth the <HI>King of France</HI> to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck well to his Town of <HI>Monstreville,</HI> as being a border Town within two miles of <HI>Artoys</HI>; and especially co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ering, that the taking of it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off all entercourse be∣tween the Countreys of <HI>Boulogne</HI> and <HI>Calais</HI> with the rest of <HI>France.</HI> Of the like importance also

are the Towns of <HI>Abbeville</HI> and <HI>Amiens</HI>; and that the <HI>French Kings</HI> are not ignorant of: Insomuch that those two onely, together with that of <HI>St. Quintin,</HI> being put into the hands of <HI>Philip Duke</HI> of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> to draw him from the party of the <HI>English,</HI> were redeemed again by <HI>Lewis</HI> the ele∣venth for 450000.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE are now come to the <HI>Country</HI> of <HI>Bou∣lonnois,</HI> which though a part of <HI>Picardy,</HI> disdaineth yet to be so counted; but will be rec∣koned a <HI>County</HI> of it self: It comprehendeth in it the Towns of <HI>Boulogne, Escapes</HI> and <HI>Neus-Chastel,</HI> beside-divers Villages, and consisteth much of hils and valleys, much after the nature of <HI>England</HI>; the soyl being indifferent fruitful of corn, and yeild∣ing more glass than any other part of <HI>France</HI> (which we saw) for the quantity. Neither is it onely a County of it self but it is in a manner also a free County; it being holden immediately of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI>; who is, no question, a very gra∣cious <HI>Land Lady</HI>: For when <HI>King Lewis</HI> the ele∣venth, after the decease of <HI>Charles of Burgundy,</HI> had taken in <HI>Boulogne▪ Anno</HI> 1477. As new <HI>Lord</HI> of the Town (thus <HI>John de Sierries</HI> relateth it) he did homage without sword or spurs, bare∣headed, and on his knee before the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> offering unto her image an heart of <HI>Massie gold,</HI> weighing two thousand Crowns; he added also this, that he and his successors after him being <HI>Kings</HI> should hold the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Boulogne</HI> of the same Virgin, and do homage unto her image in the great <HI>Church</HI> of the higher Town dedicated to her na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every change of a <HI>Vassal</HI> an
<PB N="351" REF="176"/>
heart of pure gold of the same weight. Since that time the <HI>Boulonnois</HI> being the Tennants of our <HI>La∣dy,</HI> have enjoyed a perpetual exemption from ma∣ny of those tributes and taxes under which the rest of <HI>France</HI> are miserably afflicted. Amongst others they have been alwayes freed from the gabel of Salt, by reason whereof, and by the goodness of their pastures, they have there the best Butter in all the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> I say, partly by reason of their Salt, because having it at a low rate they do liberally season all their Butter with it; whereas they which do buy their Salt at the <HI>Kings</HI> price cannot afford it any of that dear commodity: Upon this ground, it is the custom of these of <HI>Boulonnois</HI> to send unto their Freinds of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> a barrel of Butter seasoned according to their fashion; a present no less ordinary and acceptable, than Turkeys, Capons, and the like are from our Country Gentlemen to those of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Town of <HI>Boulogne</HI> it is divided into two parts, <HI>la haute Ville,</HI> and <HI>la Bass Ville,</HI> or the <HI>High Town,</HI> and the <HI>Low Town,</HI> distant one from the other about an hundred paces and upwards. The high Town is seated upon the top of an hill; the low Town upon the the declivity of it and towards the Haven: Or else we may divide it into two other parts, <HI>Viz.</HI> the Town and the <HI>City</HI>; the Town that towards the water, and the <HI>City</HI>; that which lieth above it. It was made a <HI>City</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Anno</HI> 1553. at which time the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Terorenne</HI> was totally ruined by the <HI>Impe∣rials,</HI> and the <HI>Bishop</HI> was removed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther: The
<PB N="352" REF="177"/>
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Nostre Dame</HI> being made the Cathe∣dral: there came along hither upon the remove of the <HI>Bishop</HI> 20. <HI>Chanoins,</HI> which number is here still retained; their revenues being about a 1000. <HI>Liures</HI> yearly: as for the present <HI>Bishop,</HI> his name is <HI>Pierre de Arme,</HI> his intrado twenty thousand <HI>Liures</HI>: His <HI>Metropolitan</HI> he of <HI>Rhemes</HI>: The Town or (as they call it) the low Town is bigger than the <HI>City,</HI> and better built, the streets larger, and the people richer, most of the Merchants li∣ving in it, because it lieth above the Haven: but that which made this low town most pleasing, was a solemn procession that passed through the streets of it, intended to pacifie <HI>Gods</HI> anger, and divert the plague, which at that time was in the <HI>City.</HI></P>
<P>In the first front there was carried the <HI>Cross,</HI> and after that the holy and sanctified Banner; next unto it followed all the <HI>Priests</HI> of the Town bare∣headed, and in their Surplices, singing as they went the services destinate to that occasion: after them followed the Men, and after them the Women of the Town by two and two, it being so ordered by the <HI>Roman Ritual. Ʋt Laicia Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ricis, faeminae a viris separatae prosequantur.</HI> On the other side of the street went the Brethren <HI>dela Charite,</HI> every one of them holding in his hand a little triangular Banner, or a Pennon: after them the Boys and Wenches: in this method did the solemnity mea∣sure every lane and angle of the Town, the <HI>Priests</HI> singing, and all the people answering them in the same note. At the <HI>Church</HI> they began it in prayer, and having visited all the Town, they returned
<PB N="353" REF="177"/>
again thither to end it with the same devotion. An action vety grave and solemn, and such as I could very well allow of, were it not onely for one prayer, which is alwayes said at the time of this performance, and addition of the Banners: The prayer is this; <HI>Exaudi nos Deus salutaris noster, &amp; intercedente beatâ &amp; gloriosa Dei genetrice Mariâ semper Virgine, &amp; Sebastiano beato Martyre tuo</HI> (this <HI>Sebastian</HI> is their <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> or <HI>Tutelary Saint</HI> against the sickness) <HI>&amp; omnibus Sanctis po∣pulum tuum ab iracundiae tuae terroribus libera, &amp; misericordiae tuae fac largitate securum. Amen.</HI> This onely excepted, there is nothing in the whole <HI>Li∣turgy</HI> of it, which can be offensive to any consci∣ence not idle scrupulous.</P>
<P>These <HI>Processions</HI> were first instituted by <HI>Pope Stephanus</HI> the second, who began his <HI>Popedom Anno</HI> 752. the intent of them is, as <HI>Platina</HI> reporteth, <HI>Ad placandam Dei iram.</HI> The first place that they ever went to in <HI>Procession,</HI> was the <HI>Church</HI> of our <HI>Lady</HI> in the Shambles, or <HI>ad Sanctam Dei genitri∣cem ad praesepe,</HI> as the <HI>Historia</HI> calleth them. As for the <HI>Letany,</HI> which is a principal part of it, it was first compiled by <HI>Mamercus Bishop of Vienna</HI> in <HI>Daul∣phine,</HI> in the time of <HI>Pope Leo</HI> the first, which was 308. years after the time of <HI>Stephanus.</HI> The mo∣tive of it was the often danger to which <HI>France</HI> was subject by reason of the frequency of Earth∣quakes: Since those beginnings, which were fair and commendable, the <HI>Romish Church</HI> hath added much to them of magnificence, and somewhat of impiety and prophaneness. As for the Brethren <HI>de la Charite,</HI> I could not learn any thing of their
<PB N="354" REF="178"/>
original, but much of their office: for they are bound to visit all such as are infected with the Plague, to minister unto them all things necessary, and if they die, to shrowd them and carry them to their graves. These duties they perform very willingly, being possessed with this fancy, that they are priviledged from contagion by vertue of their Order; and to say the truth, they are most of them old, and so less subject to it; and indeed such sapless, thin, and unbodied fellows, that one would think almost no disease could catch them: yet hath their prerogative not alwayes held to them: Of thirty three of them in <HI>Callice</HI> three onely sur∣viving the disease about four years since: But were the danger to which themselves are liable all the inconvenience of it, I should not much disallow it. There is a greater mischeif waiting upon it, and that is the infecting of others; they immedi∣ately after their return from the <HI>Pest-house</HI> mixing themselves with any of their neighbours: A most speedy meanes to spread the pestilence, where it is once begun, though neither they nor the people will be perswaded unto it.</P>
<P>The <HI>City</HI> or the high Town standeth, as we have said, on the top of the hill, environed with deep ditches, a strong wall, and closed with a tre∣ble gate▪ and two draw-bridges: a little small Town it is, not much above a slights shoot thwart where it is widest; and hath in it but one <HI>Church</HI> besides that of <HI>Nostre Dame,</HI> which is the Cathedral: the streets not many, and those narrow, unless it be in the market place; where the <HI>Corpus du Guard</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept. What the outworks are, or whether it hath
<PB N="355" REF="178"/>
any or no I cannot say; Even in this time of League and peace, their jealousie will not permit an <HI>English man</HI> to walk their wall, either within the Town or without. A Castle they said, that it hath; bur such a one as seemeth more for a dwel∣ling than a fort. The Garrison of this Town consisteth of five Companies, sixty in a Company, which amount in all to 300. their <HI>Governour</HI> being <HI>Mr. de Anmont</HI> sonne to the <HI>Marshal de Anmont,</HI> who so faithfully adhered to <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth in the beginning of his troubles: the cause why this Town being so small is so strongly Garrison'd is the safe keeping of the Haven which is under it; and the command of the passage from the Haven up into the Country: The first of these services it can hardly perform without much injury to the low Town which standeth between them; but for the ready discharge of the last it is daintily seated, for though to spare the low Town, they should permit an enemie to land; yet as soon as he is in his march up into the higher Country, their Or∣dinance will tear him to pieces: But for the im∣mediate security of the Haven, their Ancestors did use to fortifie the old Town standing on the top of the hill, called <HI>La Tower de Ordre</HI>; it is said to have been built by <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> at the time of his second expedition into <HI>Brittaine</HI>: this Haven being then <HI>Portus Gessorianus.</HI> This Tower which, we now see, seemeth to be but the remainder of a greater work; and by the height and scituation of it, one would guesse it to have been the <HI>Key</HI> or watch Tower unto the rest; it is built of rude and vulgar stone, but strongly cemented together;
<PB N="356" REF="179"/>
the figure of it is six square, every square of it be∣ing nine paces in length: A compass to little for a Fortress; and therefore it is long since it was put to that use: it now serving onely as a Sea mark by day and a <HI>Pharos</HI> by night. <HI>Ʋbi accensae noctu faces navigantium cursum dirigunt.</HI> The <HI>English men</HI> call it the <HI>Old man of Boulogue</HI>: and not improperly; for it hath all the signes of age upon it. The Sea hath by undermining it, taken from it all the earth, about two squares of the bot∣tom of it, the stones begin to drop out from the top; and upon the rising of the wind, you would think it were troubled with the Palsie: in a word two hard winters, seconded with a violent tempest, maketh it rubbish: what therefore is wanting of present strength to the Haven in this ruine of a Tower, the wisdom of this age hath made good in a Garrison.

we were not inferiour to our neighbours in the greatness of our care; since we are equal to the best of them in the goodness of our <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Boulogne</HI> and the <HI>Country</HI> about it was taken by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth of <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1545. himself being in person at the siege; a ve∣ry costly and chargeable victory. The whole list of his Forces did amount to 44000. foot, and 3000. horse: Field Pieces he drew after him a∣bove a hundred, besides those of smaller making, and for the conveyance of their Ordinance, bag∣gage, and other provision, there were transport∣ed into the Continent above 25000. Horses. True it is that his designes had a further aim, had not <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Emperour,</HI> with whom he was to join, left the field, and made peace without him, So that judging onely by the success of the expediti∣on, we cannot but say that the winning of <HI>Bou∣lonnois</HI> was a dear purchase; and indeed in this one particular <HI>Sr. Walter Raleigh</HI> in the preface to his most excellent History saith not amiss of him, namely, that in his vain and fruitless expedi∣tions abroad, he consumed more treasure, than all the rest of our victorious Kings before him did in their several Conquests: The other part of his censure of that <HI>Prince,</HI> I know not well what to think of, as meerly composed of gall and bitter∣ness: Onely I cannot but much marvail that a man of his wisdom, being raised from almost no∣thing by the <HI>Daughter,</HI> could be so severely in∣vective against the <HI>Father</HI>: certainly a most cha∣ritable judge cannot but condemn him of want of true affection and duty to his <HI>Queen</HI>: seeing that
<PB N="358" REF="180"/>
it is (as his late Majesty hath excellently noted in his ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ ΔΩΡΟΝ) a thing mon∣strous to see a man love the Child and hate the Parents: And therefore he may earnestly enjoyn his Son <HI>Henry,</HI> to <HI>repress the insolencie of such as un∣der pretence to tax a vice in the person▪ seek craftily to stain the Race.</HI></P>
<P>Presently after this taking <HI>Boulogne,</HI> the French again endeavoured the regaining of it, even during the life of the <HI>Conquerour</HI>; but he was strong e∣nough to keep his gettings: After his death the <HI>English</HI> being engaged in a warr against the <HI>Scots,</HI> and <HI>Kit</HI> having raised a rebellion in <HI>Norfolk</HI> they began again the reconquest of it, and that more violently than ever. Upon news of their prepa∣rations, an <HI>Ambassage</HI> was dispatched to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth to desire succours of him; and to lay be∣fore him the infancy and several necessity of the young <HI>King,</HI> who was then about the age of ten years. This desire when the <HI>Emperour</HI> had refused to hearken to, they besought him, that he would at the least be pleased to take into his hands and keeping the Town of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> and that for no longer time, than until <HI>King Edward</HI> could make an end of the troubles of his Subjects at home. An easie request; yet did he not onely deny to satis∣fie the <HI>King</HI> in this, except he would restore the <HI>Catholike Religion,</HI> but he also expresly command∣ed, that neither any of his men or munition should go to the assistance of the <HI>English.</HI> An ingratitude for which I cannot find a fitting <HI>Epithite,</HI> consi∣dering what fast friends the <HI>Kings of England</HI> have alwayes been to the united <HI>Houses</HI> of <HI>Burgundy</HI>
<PB N="359" REF="180"/>
and <HI>Austria</HI>; what moneys they have helped them with, and what sundry warrs they have made for them, both in <HI>Belgium</HI> to maintain their authority, and in <HI>France</HI> to augment their potency: from the marriage of <HI>Maximilian</HI> of the Family of <HI>Austria</HI> with the <HI>Lady Mary</HI> of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> which happen∣ed in they ear 1478. unto the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which fell in the year 1548. are just seventy years, in which time onely it is thought by men of knowledge and experience, that it cost the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>England</HI> at the least six millions of pounds in the meer quarrels and defence of the <HI>Princes</HI> of those Houses. An expense which might seem to have earned a greater requital than that now de∣manded. Upon this denial of the unkindful <HI>Em∣perour,</HI> a <HI>Treaty</HI> followed between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> The effect of it was, that <HI>Boulogne</HI> and all the Country of it should be restored to the <HI>French,</HI> by paying to the <HI>English</HI> at two dayes of payment 800000. Crowns. Other Articles there were, but this the principal: and so the fortune of young <HI>Edward</HI> was like that of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> towards his end: <HI>Dum clementiam, quam praestiterant, expectant, incauti ab ingratis occupati sunt.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION. A Generall censure of <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>French.</HI> A gratulation to <HI>England.</HI> The end of our journey.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>wednesday</HI> the third of <HI>August,</HI> having stay∣ed in <HI>Boulogne</HI> three dayes for wind and company, and not daring to venture on <HI>Calice,</HI> by reason of the sickness there raging, we took ship for <HI>England</HI>: the day fair, and the wind fitly ser∣ving us, we were quickly got out of the harbour into the main. And so I take my leave of <HI>France,</HI> a <HI>Country</HI> which I know not whether it be more happy in it self, or more unhappy in its Inhabi∣tants. This I am almost confident of, that the worst of its commodities are the people; who by no vertue of theirs, which my understanding is yet guilty of, deserve to grow there: <HI>France</HI> then being in their possession, is like a delicate choice dish of meat disgraced in the cooking: Or to give you my verdict of them both, both Men and Country; modestly, and in a word, I think you never saw <HI>a fair Lady worse marred,</HI> and indeed to speak the truth —,</P>

<L>But soft; What white is that which I espie,</L>
<L>Which with its lustre doth eclipse mine eye?</L>
<L>That which doth <HI>Neptunes</HI> fury so disdain,</L>
<L>And beats the billow back into the main?</L>
<L>It is some dreadful <HI>Scylla</HI> fast'ned there,</L>
<L>To shake the Sayler into prayer and fear:</L>
<L>Or its some I stand floating on the Wave,</L>
<L>Of which in Writers we the stories have:</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>England</HI>; hah! 'tis so: clap, clap your hands,</L>
<L>That the full noise may strike the nighb'ring lands</L>
<L>Into a Palsey: Doth not that lov'd name</L>
<L>Move you to extasie? Oh were the same</L>
<L>As dear to you as me; that very word</L>
<L>Would make you dance and caper over board.</L>
<L>Dull Shipemen, how they move not, how their hoof</L>
<L>Grows to the planks: yet stay, here's sport enough:</L>
<L>For see the Sea Nimphs foot it, and the fish</L>
<L>Leap their high measures, equal to my wish</L>
<L><HI>Triton</HI> doth sound his shell; and to delight me,</L>
<L>Old <HI>Nereus</HI> hobbleth with his <HI>Amphitrite.</HI></L>
<L>Excellent triumphs! but (curs'd Fates) the Main</L>
<L>Quickly divides, and takes them in again:</L>
<L>And left me dying; till I came to land</L>
<L>And kist my dearest Mother in her sand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail happy <HI>England</HI>! hail thou sweetest Ile,</L>
<L>Within whose bounds no <HI>Pagan</HI> rites defile</L>
<L>The purer Faith; <HI>Christ</HI> is by <HI>Saints</HI> not mated;</L>
<L>And he alone is worshipp'd that created.</L>
<L>In thee the lab'ring man enjoys his wealth;</L>
<L>Not subject to the Lords rape; or the stealth</L>
<L>Of hungry Publicans: In thee thy King</L>
<L>Fears not the power of any underling,</L>
<L><PB N="362" REF="182"/>Or petty Prince; but by his awful word</L>
<L>Commands not more the Beggar than the Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In thee those heav'nly beauties lie, would make</L>
<L>Most of the Gods turn Mortals for their sake:</L>
<L>Such as out-go report, and make Fame see,</L>
<L>They stand above her bigg'st Hyperbole:</L>
<L>And yet to strangers will not grude the bliss</L>
<L>Of salutation and an harmless kiss.</L>
<L>Hail then sweet <HI>England</HI>! May I breath my last</L>
<L>In thy lov'd arms: and when my dayes are past,</L>
<L>And to the silence of the grave I must,</L>
<L>All I desire is, Thou would'st keep my Dust.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>And now I am safely come into my <HI>Country,</HI> where, according to the custom of the <HI>Ancients,</HI> I offer up my thanksgiving to the <HI>God</HI> of the Wa∣ters, and testifie before his <HI>Altars</HI> the grateful ac∣knowledgement of a safe voyage, and a prosperous return: Blessings which I never merited.</P>
