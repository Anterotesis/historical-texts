<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have at last demolishd those difficulties which in∣tercepted this Work, in that progress it endevoured to make, to offer it self up both to yours and the pub∣lick view. Yet I do not deny, in a Peice made rugged with so many knots, several Mistakes and Omissions must (through Inad∣vertency and Mis-information) have slip'd in; some of which had their first extraction from the Presse, and some their birth from my Pen: All which I have collected into a Table of <HI>Addenda,</HI> which is imme∣diately subsequent to the Preface, whither the Rea∣der may retire to disperse all scruples.</P>
<P>Secondly, I have not added any Numerical Al∣phabet, to direct the Reader, since the Book is so Alphabetically digested, that the Work is a Dire∣ctory Beam or Ray to it self: To which I have an∣nex'd, as an Appendage, a particular Description of all the circumambient <HI>Kentish</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I have not so tyed my self up to those severer Discourses which I have extracted from either publick or private Record, but that I have embroi∣der'd this Peice with Discourses of a softer com∣plexion;
<PB REF="3"/>as at <HI>Bilsington,</HI> I have unfolded the Cau∣ses of the Depravation of the ancient Clergy, both in Doctrine and Manners; at <HI>Birling</HI> I have disco∣vered the nature of that Tenure, <HI>Antiquity</HI> call'd <HI>Tenure per Baroniam;</HI> at <HI>Ewell</HI> I have unravell'd the first Institution of the <HI>Knights Templers,</HI> and the probable causes of their total extirpation; at <HI>New∣ington Lucies</HI> I have discours'd largely of <HI>Ʋrne En∣terment;</HI> at <HI>Rodmersham,</HI> no less of the Institution of the <HI>Knights Hospitallers;</HI> at <HI>Werth</HI> I have trea∣ted of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of <HI>Seals;</HI> at <HI>Wymings Would,</HI> of the <HI>Ancient Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Pileus;</HI> and have at several other places enterlac'd this Work with colla∣teral Discourses of the same tincture.</P>
<P>Whatsoever this Peice may appear in the whole Frame and Bulk of it, I do assure you it was not born without your Influence, it is ready to die at your Command, and cannot live but by your Ac∣ceptance. But I know you have both Art and Can∣dor; and as I cannot but hope, but that a merciful Interpretation will be emergent from the first, so I cannot doubt but the last will give so noble an Allay to your Justice, that if it cannot totally absolve, yet it may at least excuse</P>

<PB REF="4"/>Thornhill</HI> Esquire, Son and Heir of Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> now surviving, whose great Grandfather Mr. <HI>Richard Thornhill,</HI> above mentioned, purchased <HI>Mere Court</HI> in the twelfth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>Potts Court, Bradherst, Quene Court</HI> in <HI>Ospringe, Pitstock</HI> and <HI>Har∣tie,</HI> in the thirteenth year of that Princess, of Sir <HI>Hen. Cheyney,</HI> and made his Son <HI>Samuel</HI> joint purchaser with him. At <HI>Pencehurst</HI> what I have written concerning the Mannor of <HI>Pencehurst Halymote.</HI> p. 270. must be retracted and altered, and read thus. <HI>Pencehurst Ha∣lymote alias Otford VVild</HI> was anciently held in Lease by the Successive Lords of <HI>Pence∣hurst,</HI> of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as being a Limb of their Mannor of <HI>Otford,</HI> which Mannor being exchanged by <HI>VVill.

<HEAD>The <HI>Preface</HI> to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>ANtiquity is the great Luminary of Time, which dispels those Clouds, that like a gloomy Skreen, interposing between the object and the understanding, cast it into Error and Misapprehension: And not onely of Time but of Histo∣ry too; History, that faithful Register of things past, That great Informer of the present, and certain Prophet of the Future; By it we may discover the Print which former Ages made, and treading that, know how to decline the crooked and Irregular Paths of Danger and Misfortune. Antiquity is like the lamp in <HI>Tullia</HI>'s Urne, that representing to our view by Grains and by Scruples the Re∣liques and dust of our long-since expired Ancestors, which perhaps lay scatter'd in the Wilderness of their own Dispersion, erects a Monument to their Re∣membrance, so inaccessable to all the onsets and impressions of age and oblivi∣on, that then onely it shall languish into Decay and dissolution when Nature her self, and Time, the moth of Nature, shall lye gasping in their own ruines, and the Universe it self shall confess its Ashes.</P>
<P>And certinly, amongst all those Trophies which antiquity hath fix'd upon the face of this Island, there is none more Copious, if we consider them for quan∣tity; nor more Conspicuous, if we represent them in their quality, than those that it hath left scatter'd upon the Continent of <HI>Kent:</HI> and this must be obvious to the most easie Intellect, when it shall discover that in all the Eruptions of forain Invaders upon this Island, the first track of that Thorough-fair hath been laid in, or very near, this County, by which they have farther penetrated into the Bowels of this Nation. We will wave that fiction of <HI>Brute</HI> and a partie of Fugitives (originally) as the <HI>Legend</HI> insinuates of <HI>Trojan</HI> Extraction, and dis∣carded from <HI>Italy</HI> for some Misdemeanor there acted) fixing here, as likewise that Series of the Kings Subsequent to him, being wholy obtruded upon us by seduced and misguided Histories; the brain indeed of <HI>Jeffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being both the Forge and the Anvill from whence those sparks brake forth at first, which made up that <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> after which the world so long hath wandered.</P>
<P>First then the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles endevoured to surprize and seise on the Domi∣nion of this Island, though they were once or twice so rudely grip'd by the <HI>Britains</HI> neare <HI>Chilham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and some of their noblest Plumes torn from them, that they were forc'd to fly back into <HI>Gaule</HI> to new impe their Feathers but breaking in again with a recolected and multiplied strength, the Liberty of this Nation stoop'd, and became a prey to their victorious Tallons, And now it was ordered that all Pleas, Escripts, Decrees, Edicts, and other things of publique Cognisance should be issued out in the <HI>Roman</HI> Dialect, that so the roughness of the <HI>Britains,</HI> which their warlike inclinations had so long entitled them to, might not onely by degrees be fil'd off, but that likewise being suppled and softned by the <HI>Roman</HI> Culture, they might without any regret or resent∣ment
<PB REF="6"/>support that load of slavery that sat so heavy on their shoulders, and so at last become wholy riveted and incorporated into the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But this was onely in intention, for the accomplishment and perfection of it, was superseded by the Inroad of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> which like an Inundation in many signal conflicts had almost swept away the Imperial dignitie, and so torn the whole Bulk of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, that its very Spirit was ready to ebb out at those breaches. So that in fine, the Emperour was forced to re∣trive the Guards and Stationary Legions scattered o're this Island, with these like a new stock of spirits to improve and fortifie the Heart of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣pire, which was ready to bleed out its life at those wounds that the hands of these Barbarous Nations had inflicted on it.</P>
<P>And now the spirits of the <HI>Britains</HI> (a stronger Butteress against the Eruptions of the <HI>Picts</HI> than the Wall erected by the <HI>Romans</HI>) being by the Engines of a long and habituated Servitude, cowed and broken into a degenerate Effe∣minacie, they lay open to all the Assaults and impressions of the insolent In∣vader; so that they were forced either to resign up themselves to the fury and inclemency of the Sea, or else offer themselves up to the Rage and Bar∣barity of a Savage enemie: And now, being devested of all protection at home, and all hope of supply from abroad, being forelaid and intercepted by the In∣vasion of the <HI>Goths</HI> on the Empire, they made their addresses to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> a Martial People then inhabiting that nether part of <HI>Germany,</HI> which is washed by the Rivers of <HI>Elve, Weaser,</HI> and <HI>Rhine,</HI> who instantly upon Covenant and as∣surance of a vast Guerdon to ballance their services, under the conduct of <HI>Hengist</HI> and <HI>Horsa,</HI> embarqued for <HI>Britain</HI> and landed in the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> and shortly after with such vigour and animosity repressed the insolencies of the <HI>Picts,</HI> that they shut them up within the Cloisters and Recesses of their own Mountains. But it might be said of them, as it was anciently of Religion; <HI>Religion brought forth Riches, and the Daughter devoured the Mother:</HI> So these <HI>Saxons,</HI> from Assertors and Protectors of the <HI>Britains,</HI> became at last Invaders of them; for they representing to the other <HI>Saxons</HI> the health∣fulness of the Air, and the temperateness of the <HI>British</HI> Clime, who were over-stocked and cloyed with excess of People, and were willing to evacuate that surcharge of Inhabitants into forain Colonies, they instantly attaqued any advantage that might put them into Hostilitie with the <HI>Britains;</HI> and pre∣tending that that Compact so solemnely stipulated and transacted between them and <HI>Hengist</HI> was infringed and violated, they poured themselves in like a <HI>Cataract</HI> upon this Island, so that the <HI>Britains</HI> to secure themselves from the fury of this Deluge, after many vigorous attempts to make it flow back a∣gain, shut up themselves within the Solitudes and Recesses of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI> whilest on their ruines their adversaries erected and fixed their <HI>Saxon Heptarchie;</HI> which again, after many mutual encounters, wherein almost every Turfe of this Island was bespatter'd and bedewed with Blood, found a publique Tombe in the <HI>West-Saxon</HI> Monarchie.</P>
<P>But scarce was the Basis of it established, whose Ciment was so much Blood and Tears; But God, who corrects the Ambitious by retaliation and chastises the insolencies of one Invader by casting another into Competion with him, put the <HI>Dane</HI> into Ballance with the <HI>Saxon,</HI> who like a whirlewind threw himself upon this Island so that all blooming Glories of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Greatness did wither and shrivell up, being suddenly nipt and blasted by this Northern tempest. I shall not discypher the long, many, and impetuous encounters between these two fierce Nations, with the effusion of Blood
<PB REF="6"/>and the ruine and Depredation that discomplexioned every part of the Land; indeed, they are of so disordered a Memory, and then so blended and con∣founded in the Persons, Times, and Places, upon which the Scene of these de∣formed Tragedies is intricately fixt, that it would be (as one well observes) ano∣ther war to the Reader to over-look them. In brief, after a signal combat per∣sonally commenced between <HI>Edmund Ironside</HI> and <HI>Canutus,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Atheleny,</HI> both armies on either shore, being Spectators, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Diadem was by reciprocall compact to be devided between them: which after the decease of <HI>Edmund Ironside</HI> at <HI>Oxford;</HI> which, whether it were Naturall or Artificiall, is yet a controversie, wholly invested the Temples of <HI>Canutus.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! upon what a frail and incertain Pedestal is all humane greatness setled? For the lustre of this new erected Monarchy had no sooner displayed its beams in <HI>Canutus,</HI> but like an unthrifty Taper it began to glimmer in <HI>Har∣old,</HI> and absolutely expired in <HI>Hardiknute,</HI> who dying issueless, the current of Royalty ran back again into the chanel of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood, which flow'd in the veins of <HI>Edward</HI> Sirnamed the <HI>Confessor;</HI> who likewise deceasing with∣out Issue, <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> upon a pretended Donation from the last <HI>Edward</HI> entitles himself to the right and interest of the <HI>English</HI> Diadem.</P>
<P>But this certainly was invail'd, for no Testamentary collation can ravell or disorder succession, which with an indissolueble link is chain'd and fastned to the nearest of Blood, and of which the Nation is to take the sole and proper Cognisance:) And to assert his title (which was fixt on the point of his sword) he arives in <HI>Sussex</HI> with a numerous Army, to check whose farther Progress in this Island, <HI>Harold</HI> advances likewise with a considerable Army (whose body had before evapourated its best and noblest Spirits at those wounds which it before had received in a bloody encounter comenc'd with <HI>Harold Harsanger</HI> King of <HI>Norwey:</HI>) And nere that place where afterwards was founded the Abby of <HI>Battell,</HI> puts his claim to the Scepter, likewise to the Decision and Umpirage of the Sword, and after a fierce dispute found the Tombe of his new purchas'd Royalty in the carriage of this Field, upon whose ruines, <HI>William</HI> now a Con∣querour, climbs up the Ascent of the <HI>English</HI> Throne.</P>
<P>His first design (after he had scatter'd all those clouds of discontent that might have possibly have enwrapt the rays of acquired Majesty in some new umbrage,) was to take a Survey of each mans particular interest and Patrimony, which was inroll d and recorded in a publique Register commonly called <HI>Dooms∣day</HI> Book; upon pretence, that from a generall computation of the Revenue of the Nation, he might discern what strength might be collected to intercept the violent attempts of any forain Invader upon this Island. But indeed to make a strict inquisition into the Forfeitures of the Lands of those that had been in Hostility under the Ensignes of <HI>Harold</HI> against him, that with those he might not onely endear and gratifie his Partisans, but likewise by reinvesting the chiefest of his adversaries in those possessions which were by their Enmity escheated, oblige them to maintain his Title and Scepter. Yet it is observe∣able, that he engag'd all those that had receiv'd any Lands or Demeasnes of him, either by any new concession or re-investiture to hold them in Escuage, that is by Knight Service, by which they were oblig'd whensoever either publique necessity or his Commands did exact it of them, to attend his Person, either actually or virtually, that is by Proxie with Horse and Armes; and by this art he had always a power in reserve to repress and scatter all Solleviations or sud∣den Insurrections at home, and contradict all the Attempts and Animosities of Adversaries from abroad; that so he might become considerable to his enemies,
<PB REF="7"/>and usefull to his Friends. Thus have I compendiously wound up the severall Invasions made on this Island, in which <HI>Kent</HI> was so much concern'd. But there is another Invasion that I have not yet numbred, which hath been more ruinous and distructive to the noblest Families of this Island than any of those above recited: and that is the Riot and Excess, that like an Infectious Cloud, whose noysome wombe drops nothing but disease and Pestelence, hath lately broke in upon this Nation, and so withered the Root of the most ancient Gentry, that they have shrunk into their own ruines, and faln negelcted and forgotten: Indeed our modern Luxury is like the Poyson of the Viper, it blasts invisibly, and distroys insensibly, and they that are softned with it are like a Tree, that feeds those wormes that must devoure it; or like Iron, that supplyes that rust which will corode it. Indeed 'tis observable, that those Families have continued in their splendor longer whose seats and habitations have engag'd them to a remoter distance from the Verge and Sphere of the City, than those whose Revenue and Patrimonie hath confin'd upon a place infected with so much Debaucherie, and let loose into so great excess. Yet, 'tis remarkable that the cadets, or younger slips issued out from some of those stems, who by their own vitious exorbitancie have crumbled into an inreparable decay, by being inoculated upon other Families, have by this transplantation contracted newsap and verdure, and again sprouted out and florish'd. For Families are like the River of <HI>Arethusa,</HI> they sometimes sink in one place or County, and again rise in another.</P>
<P>I shall now take the County of <HI>Kent</HI> under Survey or Prospect, and repre∣sent to the publique view, those several Antiquities which in my search I found to lie wrapt up either in common Records, or shut up in the private Muniments, Escripts, and Registers of particular Families; from whom I have endevour'd to pluck off the veil that they may for the future stand as an Alpha∣bet to point out those Families that are yet in being, that are totally exinguish'd or that lye entomb'd in other Names and Extractions, which by Mariage have swallowed up the Heir generall: In the pursuit of which I confess I have not cloister'd my self up in the nice restraints of any precise or particular Method, because that flood, both of private and publique inteligence, which like a Torrent broke in upon me, swept away whatsoever my busie fancy had built upon the sands of any curious or Methodical invention; But 'tis here, as in some Rivers who though they wander in a crooked and irregular chanell, yet are they the same Streames still, as long as they hold correspondence with their first Fountain and original.</P>
<P>I shall remit all to the Justice and Candor of the Reader, with the first he may arraigne and censure, with the last absolve and excuse</P>

<P>These Hundreds were parcel'd out into such a proportion or number of Boroughs, Villages or Tythings, containing ten Housholders, whereof (as the <HI>Saxon</HI> Laws and Customes informe us,) if any one should commit an unlawful Act, the other nine were to attach and bring him to Reason. If he fled, thirty one dayes were enjoyn'd him to appear: if in the mean time apprehended, he was forc'd to restore the Damage done; otherwise the Free-borough-head (that is to say the Tythingman) was to take with him two of the same Village, and out of three other Villages next adjoyning as many (that is, the Tythingman and two other of the Principal men) and before the Officers of that Hundred purge himself and the Village of the fact, restoring the Damage done, with the Goods of the Malefactor; which if they sufficed not to satisfie, the Free∣borough or Tythingman must make up the rest, and besides take an oath to be no way accessary to the Fact; and to produce the offender, if by any means they could recover him, or know where he were. Besides, every Lord and Master stood Borough for all his Family, whereof if any servant were cal'd in question, the Master was to see him answer it in the HUNDRED where he was accus'd; if he fled, the Master was to resigne such goods as he had to the King: If himself were accus'd to be aiding or privy to his Servants flight, he was to clear himself by five men, otherwise to forfeit all his Goods to the King, and his man to be Outlawed. These Links thus intermutually fastned, made formerly so strong a chain to hold the whole frame of the State toge∣ther in Peace and order, as all the mingled policies upon Earth, all the inter-leagued Societies of Men cannot represent a straiter Form of combination.</P>
<P>As touching the other Customes of <HI>Kent,</HI> they have been so fully discuss'd by Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> in his <HI>Kentish Perambulation,</HI> that I shall not much insist in the discove∣ry of them: only I shall something winnow the word <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> because from that it is pretended the Tenure it self is derived. First, it is suggested, that the word <HI>Gavelkind</HI> is amass'd together of three <HI>Saxon</HI> Monosyllables, that is to say, <HI>Goef ele Kent:</HI> but how this Custome should be originally established on three Syllables by the corruption of Time thus crouded and shut up in one word, is altogether ambi∣guous and mysterious: For, if we shall unvail the word of its <HI>Saxon</HI> Habit, and put it into an English dress, it will signifie thus much, <HI>Give all Child;</HI> and how much nonsense lurks in that expression, I think is easily discernable: Indeed the phrase should be, if we would attempt to spin any thing of advantage out of it, <HI>Goef ele Kendern, Give all Children,</HI> But how much of incongruitie and non-coherence lies wrapt up even in this, I beleeve is obvious enough; yet admit there were none, how four Syllables all of different vowels in their termination, should at length by the depravation of Language be all confusedly shuffled and stiv'd into this one word <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> will certainly appear to the most easie apprehension disputable enough.</P>
<P>For my own particular, I'm convinc'd (with submission to cleerer speculations) that this word <HI>Gavelkind</HI> is derived from the <HI>Saxon</HI> word <HI>Gabel,</HI> which in the Latin we render <HI>Census,</HI> and put into English signifies some Rent-Service, or Tribute issuable from such and such Land, on which it is fixt as a solemn evidence of some homage due to the Prince or supreme Magistrate, for that security which is received both in life and propriety by his defence and tuition. And certainly this is some∣thing proportionate to Reason; for all <HI>Gavelkind</HI>-Land is held in the Tenure of free-Soccage, which is charg'd with this manner of Rent-charge or imposition; and so in several Latine Records is represented under the Notion of <HI>Terra Censualis.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<P>'Tis true, that by the ancient custome of <HI>Germany,</HI> cal'd <HI>Land-Skiftan,</HI> the Lands of the deceased was by equal portions to be distributed amongst all the Sons; but then it is as probable that this Tribute or <HI>Gabel</HI> did accompany it, because the most essen∣tial part of this Custome hath through the Channel of many hundred years flow'd down to this present Age, and is in force in sundry places in <HI>Germany</HI> at this instant: For though the Hernelickheis or Lordship, as they style it, descend Patrimonially <HI>per Jus Dominatus,</HI> by the right of Signorie to the elder Son, yet all the Land ex∣clusiely from that is equally divided between the Cadets or younger Brothers, on∣ly returning some inconsiderable Rent-Service to the Prince, as a character of that Fealtie thy owe him for sheltring them in their several Patrimonies by his mutual support and protection.</P>
<P>Certain it is when <HI>Hengist</HI> transported his <HI>Saxons</HI> first into <HI>Britain,</HI> that Custome of <HI>Land-Skiftan</HI> was wafted over with them, and was by him allow'd to his Abet∣tors and Partisans when they were invested in their new Acquists and Possessions in <HI>Kent,</HI> as all other Franchises and Immunities were, which before in <HI>Germany</HI> they were by prescription endow'd with, that they might more vigorously improve his designes upon this Island; yet still it is possible he reserved out of those <HI>Demeasnes</HI> thus by Grant couveyed to his complices, some Annual Tax or Gabel (though per∣haps of a low and narrow value) as a signal acknowledgement that the Superiori∣ty or Soveraignty was solely lodg'd in him.</P>
<P>There are two other Customes which are properly calculated for the Meridian of <HI>Romeney Marsh,</HI> and perhaps through inadvertency were not recited by Mr. <HI>Lambert,</HI> and they are these: First, the King had anciently no Wast there, and secondly he had no Wracks, but they were appropriated to those Mannors of the <HI>Mersh</HI> that con∣fin'd on the Sea; and surely if we fathom their original we shall find their foundati∣on established on much of Reason. For first, how could the Crown entitle it self to any Wast there, where the Sea by its impetuous encroachments did engage the Inha∣bitants to cast up Mounts, and erect Banks in any place which they should find most proportionate to their defence against the fury of so formidable an adversary? For the second, it is very equitable that they that are interessed in an expence of that vast∣nesse in which the Publique (by the obligation of necessary consequences) is so much concern'd and wrapt up, should have something of Emolument indulged to them by the careful Munificence of the Prince, to poise and ballance those important dis∣bursements which the ill neighbourhood of the Ocean does oblige them to, in fortifying the <HI>Mersh</HI> with perpetual Defences and Dams against its assaults and eruptions. Having thus discovered something in relation to the Customs of <HI>Kent,</HI> before I advance farther into the Land, I shall represent what care our former Kings have embarqu'd themselves in, to secure the Sea, by fixing Sea-watches and other Military Guards upon all the Avennues and Inlets of the Coast, to represse and check the attempts of any bold Intruder, as if their own safety and indemni∣ty were folded up in the security of this County.</P>
<P>Touching then Sea-watches upon the Coast, there are three Presidents, and a Mandate from the King to the Sheriff in a time of a more modern inscription for performing the like service. The first containing the watch by night in Record is styled <HI>Vigiliae minutae,</HI> which are due of right and custome to be made by the Men of certain HUNDREDS, as by the Title thereof, and the Writ for Exe∣cution of the same may appear.</P>
<P>The second concluding the Day-watch, hence called <HI>Wardan</HI> is arbitrary, and at the pleasure of those which in time of war and common danger had authority to appoint them, of these there are three examples, one of the 9 of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. (which I intend principally to trace, as being the original to the other) which year he made preparation to invade <HI>France,</HI> and to vindicate his Title to the Crown, and the other the 20. of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. in which year he sailed into <HI>France</HI> and triumphed in the Signal battail of <HI>Crescey.</HI></P>
<P>The third describeth to whose charge several parts of the shore were assign'd for defence, in the 29, of <HI>Fdward</HI> the 3. At what time he past into <HI>France</HI> and was victo∣rious in the Encounter of <HI>Poictiers.</HI> It discovers also what parts of the Shire were to resort to the Coast for protection of the same. This order is arbitrary also,

<P>Before I shut up this discourse concerning Sea-watches, I shall represent to the Reader the Draught of a <HI>Praecipe</HI> directed to <HI>Gervas Clifton</HI> Esquire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the 26. of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, by that Prince, by which we may calculate the extent and Latitude of those commands he was to regulate himself by in his care and provision for the defence and Indempnity of this County against the eruptions of any forrain violence whatsoever.</P>

<P>Because there hath been frequent mention of <HI>Hobilers</HI> in the abovesaid dis∣course, I shall discover to the Reader a brief portraiture of them, as I have copied it by that Original which hath been pencil'd out by the learned industry of Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> in his <HI>Glossarie.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>Hobiler,</HI> sayes he, is derived from the French word <HI>Hobill,</HI> which imports as much as a light quilted Cassock; and indeed all the Latine Records say they should be <HI>Wampasa armati,</HI> which signifies or denotes a Jack; and in some parts both of <HI>Germany</HI> and the Low Countreys, at this day <HI>Wampas</HI> is us'd to express a Doublet or a short Cassock: and if you will know with what Horse they were equip'd or furnish'd for service, the abovesaid Author will tell you, that every <HI>Hobiler</HI> should be <HI>Mediocri eque instructus, &amp; ad omnem motum agili;</HI> a Horse of no great proportion, but light, and fitted for all manner of service.</P>
<P>Having represented to the Reader how sedulous the Princes of this Nation were in Modern times to secure the Maritime shores of <HI>Kent,</HI> which like a Girdle of sand almost invest this County, I shall now discover briefly and in Landskip how they were guarded, fortified, and preserved in times of an elder Inscription; which discourse I shall marshall under the Notion of <HI>Littus Saxonicum.</HI></P>
<P>We are now come to speak of the Sea-Coast, which the <HI>Romans</HI> termed <HI>LITTUS SAXONICUM,</HI> that is, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Shore: and as the opposite Shore unto it from the River <HI>Rhene</HI> to <HI>Xantoigne</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> had a Ruler over it from <HI>Dioclesians</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>time, whom <HI>Marcellinus</HI> calleth <HI>Tractus maritimi Comitem,</HI> that is, the Count or Lieu∣tenant of the <HI>Maritime Tract;</HI> the book called <HI>Notitia Provinciarum</HI> stileth, The ho∣norable Earl or Lieutenant of the <HI>Saxon</HI>-shore along <HI>Britain;</HI> whose office was, with Garisons set upon the Shore in places convenient, to represse the depredati∣ons, spoils and robberies of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> but of <HI>Saxons</HI> especially, who grievously infested <HI>Britain.</HI> And he had relation in point of Command unto the Right Ho∣norable General of the Foot-men, whom they called <HI>Presentalis,</HI> who besides the Garisons lying at the Havens assigned unto him at all assays for the defence there∣of, <HI>Victores juniores Britannicianos, Primanos juniores, &amp; Secundanos juniores</HI> (these are the names of certain Bands or Companies) these he had for his under-Officers to it. <HI>Principem ex officio Magistri presentalium à parte peditum numerarios duos, Commen∣tariensem, Cornicularium, Adjutorem, Subadjuvam, Regerendarium, Exceptores singula∣res, &amp;c.</HI> The Formalities of the Ensignes and Commission assigned to this great Officer are thus described in my former Author,

<P>For the Maritim Townes within this Government are mentioned here, <HI>Othoma</HI> is conceived by Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> and some other learned men, to have been in the Hundred of <HI>Dengy</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> in the same place or neer where St. <HI>Peters</HI> in the Wall is. And to this day doth not <HI>Brithlingsey</HI> a Towne adjacent, remain a Member of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and under the Government of the Lord Warden of the Cinque-Port.</P>
<P>Besides the Testimony of sundry inquisitions of survey of the Lord Wardens Admiral jurisdiction; Do they not crosse in direct line from the South-Foreland, which is by <HI>Margate</HI> in <HI>Thanet,</HI> and so turning up to <HI>Reculver,</HI> crosse the main Ocean to the <HI>Langrell Poynt in Essex,</HI> passing along St. <HI>Peters</HI> in the Wall, where this <HI>Othoma</HI> is said to have been, <HI>Dubris</HI> was <HI>DOVER: Lemanni</HI> or <HI>Lemannis</HI> (which is <HI>Pertus Lemanni</HI> in <HI>Antonius,</HI> and Λιμὴν in <HI>Ptolmy,</HI> but not it seems as the word <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> is significant in <HI>Greek</HI> but as it was made from the <HI>British</HI> name) <HI>LIME,</HI> or <HI>LIMEHILL</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> the place where <HI>Caesar</HI> landed when he Conquered <HI>Britain;</HI> And doth not <HI>Shipwey</HI> (the place where the Lord Warden of the Ports taketh his Oath upon his first entrance into that Government) lye in LIME, and is yet within his Government as also <HI>Hyth,</HI> which implieth as much as <HI>Portus</HI> in Latine, that is, Haven, one of the 5 Ports adjoyning, and <HI>Stutfall-Castell</HI> at the foot of LIME-HILL, was it not a Fortress built by the <HI>Romans</HI> for de∣fence of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Shore, <HI>Regulbium RECULVER,</HI> at which the water <HI>Genlade</HI> or <HI>Wantsum</HI> entered in, and passing by <HI>Sarre</HI> a place yet under the Lord Wardens juris∣diction, insulated the Isle of <HI>Thanet, Rutupis</HI> RICHBORROW near SAND∣WICH on the same Shore, and <HI>Anderida</HI> was situate near. NEW ENDEN in <HI>Kent,</HI> upon the river of <HI>Rother,</HI> that anciently passed by <HI>Apeldore,</HI> and disembogued it self into the Ocean at <HI>Romney;</HI> one of the Ports upon the <HI>Saxon</HI> Shore, and under the Lord Wardens goverment; <HI>Portus Adurni</HI> is supposed to have been <HI>Arundel.</HI> or <HI>Edrington</HI> near <HI>Shorham</HI> in <HI>Sussex, Branodunum</HI> is taken for BRANCASTER in <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Gariono</HI> or <HI>Gariononum</HI> for YARMOUTH both of them lying up∣on the <HI>Saxon</HI> Shore in <HI>Norfolk.</HI> And do not the <HI>Barons of the Ports</HI> injoy a Privi∣ledge upon the said Coast, sending yearly two of their said <HI>Barons</HI> as their <HI>Bailiffs</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>to joyn with them of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> since they were incorporated in the Administration of publick Justice, during the free Fishing Fair, which thing they have used to do before ever the Town of <HI>Yarmouth</HI> was built. The Fortress where the Garrison appointed for the defence of this part of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Shore was resident, is now cal∣led <HI>Burrough-castell</HI> adjoyning to the River of <HI>Yare,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> hath ob∣served in his description of that Place.</P>
<P>The Barons of the Ports did Anciently send 7 of their Barons Bailiffs to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and after reduced that number to 4 whereof 2 were sent to see justice and right done a∣mong the Portsmen that did Fish upon the <HI>Saxon</HI> Shore, where <HI>Branodunum</HI> in <HI>Norfolk</HI> stood, and in those times they continued 40 dayes, which since hath been re∣duced to 2 Bailiffs; and their time of stay to 20 dayes, the <HI>Cerimonial</HI> of their en∣trance and reception into <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> continues some similitude of what is before expres∣sed yearly upon the <HI>Ʋigil</HI> of St. <HI>Michael</HI> the Arch-angell; the Bailiffs of the Barons of the Ports, with the Banner or Ensign of their general incorporation displaid, and of this form ride on horseback into the said Town, to the house provided for them, during their abode there; and are to be received with civil and mutuall respect by the Magistrates of that Place.</P>
<P>The Officers Atending upon the Bailifs of the Barons of the Ports are these

</LIST></P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>Cinque Ports arms: three lions passant guardant conjoined to as many ships' hulls</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>As for that Officer called the Serjeant of the Horn, be it understood as an ancient note of the Ports tenure by Cornage, from King <HI>Canutus</HI> time, by which, as the best Customals of the Cinque Ports inform me there Moots and publick Assemblies are summoned, <HI>Sonitu Cornu.</HI></P>
<P>Having entred into a Discourse of the Cinque Ports, I shall take a farther propsect of those privileges they were invested with, from or before the Con∣quest, especially by that signall Charter, which was granted to them in the 20 year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. First, then they were exempted from all Taxes and Tallages, that they might with more vigor and alacriry be encouraged and emboldened to attend the publique Service.</P>
<P>Secondly, they had <HI>Sac</HI> and <HI>Soc, Sac</HI> is a privilege to take Cognisance of causes either Criminal or Civil within their own Courts, <HI>Soc</HI> is a power planted in them to compel all persons which live within the Confines of their Liberties, to plead in their Courts, and from hence anciently they were called <HI>Socmanni,</HI> that is, Suiters to that Court, where they were forced to plead.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they had <HI>Toll</HI> and <HI>Theam, Toll</HI> was a Liberty of buying and sel∣ling within their own juisdiction, and a power to receive the <HI>Toll</HI> or <HI>Gabel</HI> imposed on commodities there vended. <HI>Theam</HI> is both a civil and coercive power or jurisdiction settled in them by Charter, over all those who are inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or any of the limbs or members of them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, they had <HI>Bloodwith</HI> and <HI>Fledwith, Bloodwith</HI> is a power to punish the effusi∣on of Blood; <HI>Fledwith</HI> is an authority to punish those who having committed any misdemeanor or outrage, and seeking to secure themselves by flight, are again seised upon, and offered up to deserved Justice.</P>
<P>Fifthly, they had <HI>Pillorie</HI> and <HI>Tumbrell, Tumbrell</HI> was an Engine much resembling our Cucking-stool, and was instituted to restrain the fury of loud clamorous and impetu∣ous Women.</P>
<P>Sixthly, they had <HI>Infangetheof</HI> and <HI>Cutfangetheof,</HI> that is a power to imprison, and
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>upon just and legal evidence (which is the Lanthorn of the Law) to execute all those, though Forainers and Aliens which should commir any felony in places subject to their jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Seventhly, they had <HI>Mundbriech;</HI> that is, a priviledge to raise banks and mounds on any persons land whatsoever, whose proprietie lay within their jurisdiction, to secure the common Interest from the eruptions and casuall Inundations of the Sea▪</P>
<P>Eightly, they had <HI>Waives,</HI> called by a generall name in old Law-Latin <HI>Weveragium,</HI> and <HI>Strays Waives</HI> was a word of a common latitude, used to signifie all those things, either wandering Chattel, or other goods, which being waved or lost, and not claimed within a year and a day, were to be possest by those within whose jurisdiction they were seis'd, according to that of the Civill Law, <HI>Quae nullius juris sunt, &amp; pro derelictis habentur, cedunt occupanti.</HI> Strays is a word of a more circumscrib'd and restrained sense, relating only to stragling Cattel; to whom if none did entitle themselves by claim in a year and a day, their propriety was invested in those who possest them.</P>
<P>Ninthly, they had <HI>Waste</HI> and <HI>Strep,</HI> or Estrepment Waste was that parcell of common earth which by prescription and custome belonged to the Crown, but by Charter was enstated on them. <HI>Strip</HI> or <HI>Estrepment</HI> is a power granted to them to cut down Trees within their own jurisdiction, without impeachment of waste.</P>
<P>In the tenth place, they had the grant of <HI>Flotsom, Jetsom, Witsom: Flotsom</HI> were goods upon some visible wrack floating to the shore <HI>Jetsom,</HI> were goods in a storme thown over board to preserve the Ship, and sinking did again buoy up themselves, anr were again by the agitation of the waves thrown on the Strand. <HI>Witsom</HI> were goods driven to the shore, when there had not been for some space any wrack visible; from whence they were anciently styled Goods of Gods mercy; <HI>Wit,</HI> in old English importing as much as <HI>Misericordia</HI> in Latin.</P>
<P>Their eleventh priviledge was to be a <HI>Guild,</HI> that is a Fraternity or Combination of men that had all the Franchises of Court-Leet and Court-Baron annex'd to them; as likewise they were endow'd with a power upon emergent occasions to improve the common interest, to lay Assessements and Taxes upon the Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports and their Members; the word <HI>Guild</HI> being extracted from an old Latin word called <HI>Geldo,</HI> which signifies to tax.</P>
<P>Their twelfth Franchise was, to assemble at <HI>Shepway,</HI> which was anciently called the Portmote or Parliament of the Cinque Ports; there they punish'd the infringers of their priviledges, and amerc'd all those who being Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or of those Towns which were circumscrib'd within their Jurisdiction, sued out of those Courts which were properly established to hear and determine all causes arising within their Liberties; here likewise they had Authority, by Royall Concession, to make By-Laws and Ordinances, for the common good and profit of the Cinque Ports, and for the better Regulating (as the exigency of Affairs might seem to exact) the Herring∣fishing at <HI>Yarmouth;</HI> and that this Court in the power of it might appear to be the Coun∣terpane of that great Original of Power, the high Court of Parliament, all appeals from the inferior and subordinate Courts of the Cinque Ports were transmitted and transfer'd to this of <HI>Shepway.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, the Barons of the Cinque Ports claim by inherent Custome and Prescription, which is grown up and confirm'd by a tacite consent between them and the King, to support the four Staves of the Canopy that covers the Kings Head at his Coronation, and after to dine at the uppermost Table in the great Hall, on his right hand.</P>
<P>There are other Franchises and priviledges circumscrib'd within the Verge and Cir∣cumference of the above-recite a Charter, as the taking cognizance of the Assize of Bread and Beer, and some others; which because they are not of that importance or consideration as those which before were rehearsed, and moreover finding that they are calculated for the Meridian of many other Corporations besides that of the Cinque Ports, I have at present forbore any farther Recital of them.</P>
<P>Now if any one will enquire what the Cinque Ports were to act by way of recom∣pence or retribution for these so solemn and signall Characters and Demonstrations of royal favour; To this I answer, That they were to find fifty and seven Ships at their own Charge, for the space of fifteen days, to attend the King whensoever he should pass the Seas; whereof <HI>Hasting</HI> was to find one and twenty, <HI>Sandwich</HI> five, <HI>Hieth</HI> five, <HI>Romney</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>five, and <HI>Dover</HI> one and twenty; each of which was to be furnished with one and twenty men, and a <HI>Garcion</HI> or Boy, the Masters stipend was to amount to 6<SUP>•</SUP> the Constables to a Sallary of the same value, and each vulgar Mariner was to have three pence <HI>per diem;</HI> and if the obligation of affairs so requir'd it that they at∣tended the King beyond the extent of fifteen days, then they were for the time fol∣lowing to be supported in their expences at the charge of the Crown. Now be∣cause the wisdome of after-times thought this too vast and burdensome an expence, to be solely and wholly sustain'd by the Cinque-Ports, therefore there were several other Towns and Villges that lay scatter'd in the Body of this Nation, that were made Mem∣bers and Limbs of the Cinque-Ports, and invested and fortified with the same Im∣munities and Liberties, that they might by consequence be enwrapt and engag'd in the same common expence. The Names of those which are situated in <HI>Kent</HI> are as followeth: <HI>viz. Sandwich</HI> had the Addition of <HI>Fordwich, Sarre, Ramsgate, Deal, Walmer,</HI> and <HI>Stonor. Dover</HI> had <HI>Feversham, Birchington,</HI> St. <HI>Johns,</HI> St. <HI>Peters, Ridlings∣would,</HI> and <HI>Folkstone. Hieth</HI> had West-<HI>Hieth. Romney</HI> had old <HI>Romney, Lydde, Prom∣hill, Dengemersh,</HI> and <HI>Orwelston. Hastings</HI> and <HI>Winchelsey</HI> had in <HI>Kent</HI> as their Appen∣dages, <HI>Bekesbourn, Grench,</HI> and <HI>Tenterden.</HI> As a L'envoy to the Cinque-Ports, I shall represent a Summary, or Bedroll of all those Persons of esteem that have had the Ho∣nour to have been dignified with the Title of Lord Wardens of the Cinque-Ports; which Scroll or Register I have collected out of an ancient Manuscript, and are in their <HI>Series</HI> or Succession as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>I might have been more copious in my Discourses of the Cinque-Ports; but be∣cause I intend to publish a particular Treatise relating solely to their Immunities, and their just Right to take cognisance of the Fishery at <HI>Yarmouth;</HI> I shall no far∣ther insist upon this subject, but proceed. <HI>KENT,</HI> upon the first eruption of <HI>Hengist</HI> and his Saxons upon this Island, was represented by himself and his Par∣tizans under that fair and noble Character, that after he had in many bloody De∣cisions broken the strength of the <HI>Britains,</HI> upon their ruines he laid the foundations of that greatnesse, on which he afterwards establish'd the Throne, by which he as∣cended to the height of Majesty, and was the first of the Saxons whose hand sway'd the <HI>Kentish</HI> Scepter; indeed <HI>Cyning</HI> the old Saxon word implyes no more but one that is dextrous and cunning in the managery of the publique Affairs, and such a one was <HI>Hengist;</HI> from whom the Series of the Kings of <HI>Kent,</HI> which I am now to mention, did as from their Fountain primitively stream forth:

</TABLE></P>
<P><HI>Egbert</HI> having thus broken the Kentish Forces, and inoculated the Scepter of <HI>Kent</HI> upon that of his own, the Title of King was for ever entomb'd in the Ruines and Tomb of the slaughter'd <HI>Baldred;</HI> nor was this County dignified with any Title at all, untill the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and then that Prince created <HI>Godwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent;</HI> a man of so low and obscure an extraction, that the concurrent Te∣stimonie of all Authors does affirm he was <HI>Bubulci Filius,</HI> the son of a Cowherd: yet notwithstanding, he made himself so considerable by his Eruptions on several parts of this Island by Land, and his depredations by Sea, that our English story swels with the rehearsal of his Acts of Devastation and Piracy. Now if you would know from whence the Latine word <HI>Comes</HI> deduces its original, that is, the <HI>Ge∣nus</HI> both to the French word <HI>Count,</HI> and the Saxon word <HI>Earle</HI> or <HI>Eorlederman,</HI> (for that was the more antient term;) I shall in a brief Model represent it to you. The ma∣king of <HI>Counts</HI> anciently, as is affirmed by <HI>Trebellius Pollio</HI> in the life of <HI>Macrianus,</HI> was in <HI>Contubernium Imperatoriae Majestatis adsciscere,</HI> to take some select Persons into the Chamber and fellowship of the Imperial Majesty: that <HI>Tiberius</HI> had some such, is most certain; for, <HI>Suetonius</HI> in his life mentions <HI>Comites Largitionum expeditionumque;</HI> whose first institution is by <HI>Seneca</HI> in his sixth Book <HI>de Bene. Cap.</HI> 34. refer'd and ascrib'd to <HI>Gracchus</HI> and <HI>Livius Drusus;</HI> they, saith he, <HI>apud nos primum instituerunt segregare Tur∣bam suam, &amp; alios in secretum recipere:</HI> and then again, <HI>Habuerunt itaque isti amicos pri∣mos, habuerunt &amp; secundos;</HI> and it is recorded of <HI>Alexander Severus</HI> by <HI>Lampridius,</HI> that <HI>Amicos non solùm primi ac secundi loci</HI> (which were certainly those persons which he had separated from the vulgar masse of men) <HI>sed etiam inferiores aegrotantes viseret.</HI> And <HI>Tacitus</HI> in his Book de <HI>Bello Germanice</HI> relates, that the Prince had <HI>duodecem Co∣mites,</HI> or twelve Companions assign'd him, who transacted the great Affairs both of War and Peace; from which Model it is probable the 12 Peers of <HI>France</HI> had their first original. In Ages of a lower step, these <HI>Comites</HI> were frequently call'd <HI>Reguli.</HI> In <HI>Can∣tia,</HI> saith <HI>Malmsbury, Omnis justitia laborabat sub cujusdam Gorongiregimine, qui tamen si∣cut omnes Reguli insulae Vortigerno substernebantur.</HI> Afterwards when <HI>Hengist</HI> had esta∣blish'd
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>his Kentish Kingdome, the Title of Earl began to commence in <HI>Otho</HI> and <HI>Ebu∣sa,</HI> Brothers to the abovesaid <HI>Hengist,</HI> as the same <HI>Malmesbury</HI> observes in his Tract <HI>de Gestis Regum Cap.</HI> 3. And the Title of Earl was anciently expressed by the word <HI>Comes</HI> amongst the Saxons, for to King <HI>Ethelberts</HI> Charter for the foundation of the <HI>Abby</HI> of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> cited by <HI>Reynerus,</HI> there are these subscriptions, <HI>Ego Hamigi∣lus Dux laudavi,</HI> and then, <HI>Ego Ocea Comes consensi, Ego Graphio Comes benedixi;</HI> and there is an old Epitaph quoted by Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Titles of Honour,</HI> the substance of which is this; that <HI>Alwain</HI> which was Founder of <HI>Ramsey-Abby,</HI> was <HI>Comes &amp; Al∣dermannus totius Angliae:</HI> but in decursion of Time, this word <HI>Eolderman</HI> being used by others besides those to whom it was proper and analogical, it began to languish into disuse, and the Title of <HI>Thane</HI> and <HI>Earl</HI> was assumed, which last hath re∣mained in force untill this day: Now the relief of a <HI>Thane</HI> (who was certainly an Earl by office, rather then Title) if he were of the first rank, that is, had the custody of some County under the King, which he paid to the Crown, was four Horses two sad∣led and two unsadled: two Swords, and four Spears, and as many Shields; And if he were of the second rank, he paid two Horses, one sadled and one unsadled, one Sword, two Lances, as many Shields, and fifty Marks in Silver; sometimes, if he were a <HI>Thane</HI> of an inferior rank, he paid eight-pound, and frequently three-pound. The relief which an Earl paid constantly to the Crown after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest was (as Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Titles of Honour,</HI> does demonstrate out of severall Records) was an Hundred pound.</P>
<P>Now the benefit which did accrue to the <HI>Count</HI> or <HI>Earl,</HI> besides a Barren and na∣ked Title to support the dignity of his Person in its due Magnificence and Splen∣dor, was the third penny arising out of the Profits of the County. <HI>Algar</HI> Earl of <HI>Merc∣land</HI> (as <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book informs us) had the third penny of the County of <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> and the Borough of <HI>Stafford</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor. And <HI>Mawde</HI> the Em∣presse when she created <HI>Milo</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> assigned to him for the support of his Honor, the third penny of that County: Many examples of the like condition are discoverable in Mr. <HI>Selden's Titles of Honour,</HI> whither I refer the Reader. And as they had the third penny, so they had frequently the Castle of the County annexed to their Title, but when by experience the Kings of <HI>England</HI> were instructed how fatally per∣nicious it was to have so many local powers concurrent with theirs, that by the strength of their retreat, and the number of confederates and Partisans, seem'd even to out∣poise the Royal Authority, it was by a Statute made in the 13<SUP>th.</SUP> year of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2<SUP>d.</SUP> for the future interdicted and prohibited.</P>
<P>Now if you will enquire when Earls or Counts from being absolute became Feu∣dal, Sr. <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> in his <HI>Glossarie</HI> will tell you that it was <HI>Tempore Othonum, &amp; sub excessu Merovinae stirpis in Galliâ,</HI> that is, about the year onet housand.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the Ensigns of Investiture, with which the Earl was created, it was anciently only with the Cincture of a Sword, but about the latter end of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the first, the Coronet began to be in use, for <HI>Aymer de Vallence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> who died in the 16<SUP>th.</SUP> year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<SUP>d.</SUP> had one, as appears by an instrument of <HI>William de Lavenham,</HI> cited by Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Titles of Honour,</HI> by which he acknowledges the receit of it from Sr. <HI>Henry Stacheden</HI> in the 12<SUP>th.</SUP> year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<SUP>d.</SUP> <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> died in the 49<SUP>th.</SUP> year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<SUP>d.</SUP> and by his last Will dated the fifth of <HI>December,</HI> gives his Noblest and Richest Coronet to his Son the Lord <HI>Richard Fitz-allan,</HI> his second to the Lady <HI>Joan</HI> his eldest, and the 3<SUP>d.</SUP> he be∣queaths to the Lady <HI>Alice</HI> his youngest Daughter.</P>
<P>What the <HI>Counts Palatine</HI> were I shall now demonstrate: they were taken immedi∣ately <HI>à Palatio,</HI> from whence they assum'd their name; and were customarily such as had the nearest relation to the Prince, either by friendship or Affinity, and to whose care and administration, he did entrust such or such a Province; and the more to improve and enable them in the discharge of their Duty, did unite some pri∣vileges and Franchises to their office; as erecting Courts of Judicature, appointing Judges to sit in them, and determine by signal decision upon causes both Criminal and Civil, and others of the like nature, that were of that luxutiant latitude, that they had the Stamp and Character of something which resembled Regality fixt upon them. He that will discover by example more of this honorary Title may read Mr. <HI>Sel∣dens
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>Titles of Honor</HI> whither, to decline all superfluity of discourse, I refer to the Reader.</P>
<P>I have now done with the Title, I shall now proceed to unwind the Register of those who were Earls of <HI>Kent</HI> subsequent to Earl <HI>Godwin.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>Having represented in Prospect the <HI>Comites</HI> and <HI>Consules,</HI> the Earls and Consuls which were originally to manage those Provinces subordinate to the Romane Go∣vernment; I shall now take cognisance of those which were anciently styl'd <HI>Vice Co∣mites &amp; Proconsules,</HI> and had care of the Provincial revenue (in relation to which they were term'd <HI>Questores Provinciarum</HI>) and the jurisdiction of some Causes only (as our Sheriffs have of divers Actions <HI>Viscontiel</HI>) and inquiry of Causes Criminal, but not determination of them. In the Saxon times they were sometimes call'd <HI>Ealdor∣men,</HI> and in Latine <HI>Vice Comites,</HI> which was applyed to them, not as they were sub∣servient to the Earl, but as they administered justice when he was either dead or absent. 'Tis true, if we dissect the word <HI>Earldom,</HI> we shall discover the last syllable: <HI>Dome</HI> is deduc'd from <HI>Dominion,</HI> and implies that the Marshal and Civil Government be∣ing anciently subordinate to Counts and Earls, there was some Analogy and re∣semblance in the Official Dignity of an Earl, and a Sheriff, and certainly the word <HI>Sheriff</HI> imports no lesse, a word contracted from the Saxon word <HI>Schyregereve,</HI> or <HI>Schyregrave.</HI></P>
<P>The word is best interpreted by the Laws, intituled <HI>the Confessors,</HI> where we read thus, <HI>Sicut modo vocantur Greves qui super, alios Praefecturas habent ita apud Anglos anti∣quitûs vocabantur EALDORMEN, quasi seniores non propter Senectutem cum qui∣dem adolescentes essent sed propter sapientiam:</HI> they were call'd anciently <HI>EALDOR∣MEN,</HI> say those Laws, not in respect of years, but wisdome. And we find <HI>Henry</HI> the 3<SUP>d.</SUP> made his Son Prince <HI>Edward</HI> the five last years of his Reign, Sheriff of <HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>Buckingham.</HI> The black Prince was often Sheriff of <HI>Cornwall</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<SUP>d.</SUP> And Prince <HI>Henry</HI> in the life of his Father <HI>Henry</HI> the 4<SUP>th.</SUP> is found to have been Sheriff of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and it was done by these Sagacious Princes, with this intent, that their Sons, when they should ascend the Throne, might be more dexterous in the Course and Conduct of the revenue of the Crown. And as these Princes were inve∣sted with this Office, so we find both Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and Ba∣rons held this Dignity; nay, sometimes Queens and Countesses, Dowagers too, with an allowance of a Shire-Clerk, which after resolv'd into him, we call the under-Sheriff. And it was usual long since, as the Statute-Law now likewise asserts it, that the <HI>Cen∣sus</HI> or Possession of some <HI>Demeasne</HI> in the County, admits a capacity to hold the office, and answer the King the Profits of the County; otherwise, they are illegal
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>and lyable to exception; and in this respect, sometime the King committed four Counties to one man, if he were possest of Lands in them all, as <HI>Hubert de Burgo</HI> was at one time Sheriff of <HI>Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and was allow'd a meet person to be his Substitute or Shire-Clerk in the ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P>If any shall demand how long there have been Sheriffs under this quallified No∣tion, as I have before represented and pourtray'd them, I must remit them to King <HI>Alfred</HI> the Founder of <HI>Englands</HI> peace, and the divider of it into Shires and Pro∣vinces; not to <HI>Gervas</HI> of <HI>Tilbury,</HI> whose definition of the Name is very deficient, making the office meerly suppletory to the Count or Earl, nor to <HI>Polidore Virgil,</HI> who being by birth an <HI>Alien,</HI> would obtrude a false opinion upon us, that the offi∣ces of the Chancellors and Sheriffs were instituted since the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest; For evidence to the confutation of him, we may read the Testimonies remembred by the most learned <HI>Selden,</HI> in the subscription of King <HI>Edreds</HI> Charter, to the Abby of <HI>Crow∣land</HI> there after Abbots, Dukes and Counts follow, <HI>Ego Afor vice Comes audivi.</HI> ✚ And in another Saxon Charter, to the same Abby there is this clause inserted, <HI>Ego Livingus Clericus istud Chirographum manu meâ subscripsi, &amp; Domino meo Theroldo tra∣didi;</HI> which Records do indisputably, I think subvert his Assertion.</P>
<P>The next Annotation upon our proconsulary Officer, is the continuation of those that in elder time held it many years together; as for example, the <HI>Cornhills</HI> did in <HI>Kent,</HI> whereby their own Sirname was discontinued, and the officiary Name <HI>le Sheriff, &amp; le Viscount</HI> swallowed up the other, and the relict of Reginald <HI>(de Cornhill) le Viscount,</HI> in a Concession of Land to the Chappel of <HI>Lukedale</HI> in <HI>Littlebourn,</HI> is styl'd in the Latine Instrument <HI>Vice Comitissa Cantii,</HI> and a Mannor of his in <HI>Minster</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> has from this Sirname obtain'd the Title of the Sheriffs Court. But when it was found inconvenient for one man to hold the place any long time, in regard of his Account, and other enormities emergent; provision was made by Statute that none should serve two years together, but should be two years at least devested of the Office ere he served again in the same County.</P>
<P>Touching the Sheriffs Letters of attendance, injoyning all Arch-Bishops, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Bishops, Barons, &amp;c. to assist him, it shews in <HI>Lankskip</HI> and <HI>Perspective</HI> afar off, the Latitude anciently of his authority; but since the institution of Lords-Lieutenants, the Beams of his power have shone forth with a more dim and contracted light: So much shall suffice for the explication of its Name, as it is Officiary. Now a word or two how it became Honorary, because as from the Con∣sul or Count, Time and Royal Authority hath extracted the Princely Dignity of Earl, which being for the most part enstated in elder times on the Kings kindred, hath caused the use of that addition ever since to all of that rank: So likewise the State and Degree of a <HI>Vicount,</HI> hath a participation of that Attribute, and are call'd Cousen by the Soveraign, and in the Scrutiny made by the Chancellor of the Order of the Garter at every Feast of St. <HI>George,</HI> during the time of <HI>Vespers,</HI> if there were any stall void; A <HI>Viscount</HI> is admitted as the lowest degree of Princes. The first that under this Ti∣tle had Parliamentary Dignity and Precedency of all Barons with us, was <HI>John de Beaumont</HI> created <HI>Viscount-Beaumont</HI> in the 18<SUP>th.</SUP> year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth without any re∣lation to the Office. The Circle or Coronet of this Degree being by its figure di∣stinguish'd from an Earls, as a Marquesses is from a Dukes.

<P>I shall before I proceed to draw out the Catalogue of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Sheriffs, repre∣sent to the world a summary List of Arch-Bishops, Earls, Bishops, and others of high eminence, which manag'd this Office, either personally or virtually; as well in o∣ther Counties as in <HI>Kent.</HI> And first, Queen <HI>Isabel</HI> had the Sheriffwick of <HI>Cornwall</HI> di∣vers years before her Husband <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<SUP>d.</SUP> was thrust out of the world by an un∣natural death, and some years under the Reign of her Son King <HI>Edward</HI> the 3<SUP>d.</SUP> <HI>Mar∣garet</HI> Widow of <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall</HI> held this Office in the County of <HI>Rutland</HI> the five last years of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and as many years in the beginning of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<SUP>d.</SUP> And after the next three years <HI>Margaret</HI> the wife of <HI>Peirce Gaveston</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall</HI> answer'd King <HI>Edward</HI> the 2<SUP>d.</SUP> the Profits of that County. <HI>Elizabeth</HI>

<P>Many more Presidents of this Nature could be unfolded, but I think these are com∣petent Testimonies enough to discover both the Dignity and Eminence of this an∣cient and illustrous office; only this may be deduc'd from these examples: That some Counties heretofore were joyned with their next Neighbors for ease of the service, as <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Surry, Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwall, Somerset</HI> and <HI>Dorset, Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Wilts, Warwick</HI> and <HI>Leicester, Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon, Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk, Essex</HI> and <HI>Hart∣ford,</HI> &amp;c. most of which were separated by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and the rest taken in sun∣der by the late King <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now endevour to unravel the Catalogue of the Sheriffs of <HI>Kent,</HI> as I find them Registred either in the Pipe-Rolls, or other Evidences; and I have as much as posibly I could, Recorded the places where they inhabited, which will much improve and inforce that light which I am to distribute to the world: in Relation to those pla∣ces I am in my subsequent discourse to treat upon.</P>
<P>And first, I find <HI>Osward</HI> a Saxon held divers Lands in <HI>Kent,</HI> as <HI>Herst, Hagalei, Norton, Chert, Stepedon,</HI> with <HI>Tunsdal,</HI> and <HI>Tong,</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor; all which Lands were in the Conquerors Time, possest by <HI>Hugo de Port:</HI> This <HI>Osward</HI> also held <HI>Delce Hadon, Alneiton</HI> and <HI>Har &amp; Sham.</HI> He was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> under the Confessor, as appears by the prime Record of the Nation, <HI>Domes day Book,</HI> where speaking of <HI>Tarentford</HI> in <HI>Axtan</HI> Hundred it is thus entred, <HI>Homines de in Hundredo testificantur, quod de isto Manerio Regis ablatum est unum Pratum, &amp; unum Alnetum, &amp; unum Molendinum &amp; XX. acrae Prati, &amp;c.

<P>In this year it being found by Experience that the former Number of the Wardens of the Peace setled by the Statute of the eighteenth of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, before mentioned, was not sufficient for the good Governance of this County; It was further provided by an Act made in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Cap.</HI> 2. Ordaining that their should be in every Shire one Lord, and with him three or four of the best in the County, and three or four learned in the Laws assigned for keeping of the Peace, and to restrain Offenders. In the next Commission awarded after this Act, these eighth Persons are recited for the abovesaid Purpose, <HI>Viz.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Herle</HI> then Lord War∣den of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle; <HI>Iohn de Cobham</HI> of <HI>Cobham, Roger de Northwood</HI> of <HI>Northwood, Ralph de Fremingham</HI> of <HI>Fremingham</HI> or <HI>Farningham, Thomas de Lodelow, Robert Vinter</HI> of <HI>Vinters</HI> in <HI>Boxley, Iohn Barrie</HI> of <HI>Sevington, Thomas Hartredge</HI> of <HI>Hartredge</HI> in <HI>Cranebroke.</HI> But this Restriction was not so permanent, but that in short space the Number was very much augmented, as by the subsequent Se∣ries in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second may very well be observed.</P>

<P>After by the Statute of the twelfth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Cap.</HI> 10. and the fourteenth year of the same Prince, <HI>Cap.</HI> 11. it was prohibited that there should be any more than six Justices of the Peace in any Commission besides the two Justices of As∣sise, and certain Lords who were assigned in the Parliament it self. But in Times sub∣sequent to these, when the Womb of Vice (like the Mudde of <HI>Nile</HI>) was more fertile in the production of Crimes, and the Seeds of Contention began to be sown more plentifully in every furrow of this Nation, which sprang up again in a numberless Variety of Discord and Animosity; these Restrictions were broke, and the Catalogue of Justices was improved to that Volume, to which it is swoln at present.</P>
<P>Before I descend to a particular Description of the Parishes of this County, I should take cognisance of all those Towns and Villages which by the indulgence of former Princes were invested with the Charter of Market and Faire:
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>But this hath been so exactly per∣formed late∣ly by Mr.</HI> Kilbourn, <HI>that I shall at present decline this Task.</HI></NOTE> Indeed all of them had this Passage inserted in the Original Grant, <HI>Quantum in Nobis est,</HI> so that ma∣ny of them when they came to be discussed before the Judges <HI>Itinerent</HI> at the general Assises, <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> they were held, that is to say, what Authority they had to sup∣port them, were if they were found convenient and necessary ratified, confirmed, and continued; but if again they were deemed needless and superfluous, they were at these publick Conventions by the power of the Law then planted in the Judges, vacated and discarded, This may likewise be added, that many of them were granted with this
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>Intention of their first Institution only to inforce and Aggrandize the Signorie of those Mannors which were parcel of the Demeasn of those eminent Persons to whom those above mentioned Royal Charters and Concessions were indulged; as, <HI>Sutton Valence, Court at Sreet, Shinglewell,</HI> and others; and when the Title and Possession of those Places was either by Purchase or Marriage cast into the Tenure of other Proprietaries, the Virtue of these Grants began to be dis-spirited, and the Custome of Keeping up Mar∣kets and Fairs at these Mannors and Parishes began insensibly to shrink into disuse and intermission. It is farther observable, that at diverse Places which were endowed with these above mentioned Priviledges, as, at <HI>Brenchly, Charlton</HI> by <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and other Parishes, the Market and Fair was observed and held in the Church-yard, and on the Sun∣day; it being the great Design of the Romish Clergie of those cloudy Times, to whom Godliness was great gain, in the practical sense, at once to charm the peoples Devotion and Benevolence: But, as if there were in the Vogue and Estimate of that Age, a greater Degree of Sanctity entailed on the Church-yard, then on the Sunday, the holding either Market or Fair in that Place was by a Statute made in the thirteenth year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the first, Chapter the sixth, wholly interdicted and prohibited; but though the Church∣yard were thus empaled, and fenced in with this new Law, the Sunday lay open and exposed to all Disorder and Prophanation, untill the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then that pious Prince resenting with regret the many Enormities and other Excesses of a black Complexion, which were occasioned by the Conflux of people assembled at these publick Meetings, and which had foully stained and debauched the purity of this Solemn Festival, did by Statute made and ratified in the twenty seventh year of his Reign, Chapter the fifth, for the future forbid the keeping of any Markets or Fairs in any Place whatsoever on the Sunday.</P>
<P>I shall now take a Prospect of all the Parishes, Villages, and Mannors, which are circumscribed, within the circle of this County; but before I wade farther in this Discourse, I shall represent upon what reasons or foundations Mannors were first in∣stituted and established, by example and resemblance of the King's policy in the in∣stitutions of Tenures, (saith Sir <HI>Francis Bacon:</HI>) The great men and Gentlemen of this Realm did the like, so near as they could; as for Example, when the King had given to any of them two thousand Acres of Lands, this party proposing in this place to make his Dwelling, or (as the old word is) his Mansion-house, or his Man∣nor-house, did devise how he might make his Land a compleat Habitation to supply him with all manner of necessaries; and for that purpose, he would give of the utter∣most parts of these two thousands Acres, one hundred, or two hundred Acres, or more or less, as he should think meet, to one of his most trusty Servants, with some reserva∣tion of rent to find a horse for the wars, and go with him when he went with the King to the wars, adding vow of Homage, and the oath of Fealty, Wardship, Marriage and Relief. This Relief is to pay five pounds for every Knights Fee, or after the rate for more or less at the entrance of every Heir: which Tenant so created and placed, was, and is to this day called a Tennant by Knights Service, and not by his own person; but of his Mannors, of these he might make as many as he would; then this Lord would provide that the Land which he was to keep for his own use, should be plowed, and his harvest brought home his House required, his Park pailed, and the like; and for that end he would give to sundry other of twenty, thirty, forty or fifty Acres; re∣serving the service of plowing a certain quantity, or so many dayes of his Lands, and certain Harvest works, or dayes in the Harvest to labour, or to repair the House, Park, Pail, or otherwise; or to give him for his provision, Capons, Hens, Pepper, Commin, Roses, Gilliflowers, Spurs, Gloves, or the like; or to pay him a certain Rent, and to be sworn to be his faithful Tenant, which Tenure was called a Soccage Tenure, and is so to this day; howbeit, most of the plowing, and Harvest services are turned into Money Rents: the Tenants in Soccage at the Death of every Tenant, were to pay Relief, which was not as Knights Service is, five pound a Knights Fee; but it was and is still one years Rent of the Land, and no Wardship or other profit to the Lord. The remainder of the two thousand Acres he kept to himself, whith he used to ma∣nure by his Bondman, and appointed them at the Courts of his Mannor how they should hold it, making an Entry of it into the Roll of the Remembrances of the Acts of his Court; yet still in the Lords power to take it away, and therefore they were called
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>Tenants at Will, by Copy of Court Roll; being in truth Bondmen at the beginning; but having obtained freedome of their persons, and gained a custome by use of occu∣pying their Lands, they now are called Copyholders, and are so priviledged, that the Lord cannot put them out, and all through custome; some Copyholders are for Lives, one, two, or three, successively; and some Inheritances, from Heir to Heir, by custome, and Custome ruleth these Estates wholly, both for Widows Estates, Fines, Harriots, Forfeitures, and all other things. Mannors being in this sort made at the first, reason was that the Lord of the Mannor should hold a Court, which is no more then to assemble his Tenants together, at a time by him to be appointed; in which Court he was to be informed, by oath of his Tenants, of all such Duties, Rents, Reliefs, and Wardships, Copy∣holds or the like, that had happned unto him; which information is called a Present∣ment, and then his Bailiff to Seise and Distrain for those Duties, if they were denied or with-holden, which is called a Court Baron; and herein a man may Sue for any Debt or Trespass under Forty pound value, and the Freeholders are to judge of the Cause up on proof produced upon both fides; and therefore the Freeholders of these Mannors, as incident to their Tenures, do hold by Suite of Court, which is to come to the Court, and there to judge between no party and party in those perty Actions; And also to inform the Lord of Duties, Rents, and Services unpaid to him from his Tenants: By this course it is discerned, who be the Lords of Lands, such as if the Tenants die without Heir, or be attainted of Felony or Treason, shall have the Land by Escheat.</P>
<P>I now proceed, to trace out the several Parishes of <HI>Kent,</HI> and marshal them Alpha∣betically; yet in this Scrutiny, I have not tortured their Names, untill by a nice and curious Anatomie, they confessed themselves to be either of British, Roman or Saxon Extraction; because, at once to decline, and unravel this Difficulty, I have cast them into a peculiar Register by themselves, which shall stand as an Appendage to the Book, and first therefore, to go on, I begin with <HI>Acris.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A. A.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ACris</HI> is a small Parish lying in the Hundreds of <HI>Folkston</HI> and <HI>Lovingborough,</HI> and was held in the twentieth of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour by <HI>Anketellus de Rosse;</HI> from which Name it passed away by Grant to the <HI>Cosentons</HI> of <HI>Cosenton</HI> in <HI>Alresford,</HI> to hold of the Barony of <HI>Rosse,</HI> and of his Mannor of <HI>Horton</HI> near <HI>Ferningham:</HI> This Seat being thus annexed to the Demeasn of this Family, came down to <HI>William de Cosington,</HI> who is in the List of those Kentish Gentlemen whom K. <HI>John</HI> in the eighteenth year of his Reign by pardon absolved, for having taken an Oath to <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dolphin</HI> of <HI>France; Charles</HI> King of <HI>Navarre</HI> (as the private Evidences of <HI>Cosington</HI> inform me) in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1366. setled an annual Pension of a thousand Crowns on Sir <HI>Stephen de Cosington,</HI> and Sir <HI>William</HI> his Son, for their remarkable Service performed against the Enemies of his Crown and Scepter. The last of this Family, which held this Man∣nor, was Sir <HI>J. Cosington,</HI> who concluded in three Danghters and Coheirs about the the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, matched to Duke <HI>Wood,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Hamon;</HI> and upon the Disunion of the Estate into Parcels, the last by Female Interest, was invested in <HI>Acris,</HI> and his Successors remained Lords of the Fee untill the Beginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then a Fatalitie like the former, brought the Patrimony of this Fa∣mily to be possest by two Daughters and Coheirs, so that Sir <HI>Robert Lewknor</HI> having matched with <HI>Katharine,</HI> who was one of them, became in her Right entituled to this Mannor, and left it to his Son <HI>Hamon Lewknor</HI> Esq; who deceasing not long since hath transmitted it during the Minority of his Son to his Widow <HI>Dowager.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Brandred</HI> lies in this Parish, and belonged to the Abby of St. <HI>Radigunds,</HI> untill the suppression, and then it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth exchanged with the Arch Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the twenty ninth of his Reign, and remained par∣cel of that Patrimony, which acknowledged the Signorie of that See, untill these tempestuous Times shook it off.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="27"/>
<P><HI>Addington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkfield,</HI> was as high as any Track of Evidence can transport me to discover, the Inheritance of a noble Family called <HI>Mandeville,</HI> and divers Deeds of a very venerable Antiquity, being without date, and now in the hands of Mr. <HI>Watton,</HI> do attest <HI>Roger de Mandeville</HI> in those elder Times to have been Lord of the Fee; but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, this Family was vanished, and had surrendred the possession of this place to <HI>Robert At Checquer,</HI> in whom the possession was but of a narrow Date, for hee not long after alienated his Interest in it to <HI>Nicholas Dagworth,</HI> as is evident by this Record registred in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> kept in the <HI>Exchequer, De Nicholao de Dagworth pro uno Feodo Militis, quod Roberius de Scaccario. tenuit in Addington de Warreno de Montecanisio</HI> 40. s. That is, <HI>Nicholas Dagworth</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, paid a respective Supply of 40. s. for his Mannor of <HI>Addington,</HI> which both he and <HI>Robert At Checquer,</HI> which enjoyed it before him, held of the Honour of <HI>Swanscamp Castle,</HI> as being the capital Seat of the Barony of <HI>Mount∣chensey,</HI> under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee. But in this Family the Title was a Volatile as in the former, for before the going out of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find it passed away from <HI>Dagworth</HI> to Sir <HI>Hugh Segrave,</HI> and he in the seventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, alienated it to <HI>Richard Charles,</HI> descended from <HI>Edward Charles</HI> Captain and Admirall of the Seas, from the <HI>Thames</HI> mouth Northward, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 34. <HI>Edwardi primi.</HI> But he was scarce warm in his new Acquists, but he expired in two Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Alice</HI> matched to <HI>William Snaith,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> married to <HI>Richard Ormeskirk;</HI> but this Mannor upon the Distinction of the Estate into Parcells was entwin'd with the Demeasne of <HI>Snaith,</HI> and he dyed possest of it (as the date of his Tombe in <HI>Addington</HI> Church informs me) in the year 1409. but dyed without Issue-male, so that his sole Daughter and Heir being wedded to <HI>Watton</HI> made it the Inheritance of that Family, and here have they planted themselves ever since that Alliance, and have performed many signal Services to this County by being invested with places of Trust, as Justices of the Peace, Commissioners of the Sewers, and other Officers of the like Condition, which hath much inforced and multiplied the eminent Reputation of this ancient Family.</P>
<P><HI>Allington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Lark field</HI> is eminent for an ancient Castle within the Limits of it; which, as Mr. <HI>Darrell</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mersh</HI> do assert, was erected by <HI>William de Columbariis,</HI> or <HI>Columbers;</HI> and this Mr. <HI>Darrell,</HI> who was very curious in Disquisitions of this Nature, more possitively affirms, because in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, when (as appears by the Records of the Tower) there was an exact Survey taken of all the Castles of <HI>England,</HI> and of those who were either Proprietaries of them, or else the respective Castellans or Guardians, one of the above mentioned Family was found to be possessor of this Fortresse, and was also Lord of the Mannor, which was still annexed to the Castle; but this Name was of no long continuance in the Tenure of either, for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, they came to own the Signorie of Sir <HI>Stephen de Penchester,</HI> Lord Warden afterwards of the Cinque Ports, to whom and to <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife, Daughter of the famous <HI>Hubert de Burgh</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the first granted a Licence in the ninth year of his Reign, as appears by the Patent-Rolls of that Time to erect a Castle, and to fortifie and embattle at <HI>Allington;</HI> so that it seems it was only before <HI>Fortalitium,</HI> some small Fortresse, and could not be marshall'd under the just Notion of a Castle, untill it had received new Symetrie and Dimensions, by those Appendages and Supplements which were added to it by this great Man; and having thus established this Pile, it came to own his Name, and is in some old Records called <HI>Allington Penchester,</HI> and not undeservedly; for in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, he obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Allington,</HI> and also a Market Weekly on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly three days, on the <HI>Vigil,</HI> the day, and day after St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> but deceased without Issue Male; so that after his <HI>Exit,</HI> it came to acknowledge <HI>Stephen de Cobham,</HI> who had married his Daugh∣ter and Coheir, and he inocculated his own Name upon it, and called it <HI>Allington Cobham,</HI> which flourished severall Descents in this Family, untill the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then I find it in the possession of <HI>Brent,</HI> but remained not long in this Name; for in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, <HI>John Brent</HI> passed away the Castle and Mannor of <HI>Allington</HI> to Sir <HI>Henry Wiat</HI> one of the Privie Councel to that
<PB N="42" REF="28"/>Prince, but his infortunate Grandchild Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> having by his Defection in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> forfeited it to the Crown, it remained there untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it to <HI>Jo. Astley</HI> Esq; Master of her Jewels, whose Son Sir <HI>Jo. Astley</HI> dying without Issue, it came by Descent to Sir <HI>Jacob Astley,</HI> created Lord <HI>Astley</HI> by the late King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> whose Descendant does now enjoy the Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Alkham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Folkston,</HI> hath divers places in it of Account.</P>
<P><HI>Malmains</HI> by vulgar Corruption of the word called <HI>Smalmains,</HI> with <HI>Hollmeade,</HI> which was ever accounted an Appendage to it, are first to be considered. In the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third I find <HI>Thomas de Malmains</HI> Son of <HI>Nicholas de Malmains,</HI> (who was Possessor of both these Places in Times of an elder Computation,) paid respective Aid at making the black Prince Knight for his Lands at <HI>Alkham.</HI> But after this I find no more intelligence given me by Record of this Family, for about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth I discover <HI>Iohn Alkham</HI> (who extracted his Sirname from this Parish, and it is very probable had here his Mansion, though now it have found a double Sepulcher, that of Oblivion, and its own Rubbish) to have been possest of them both, which he held in <HI>Castle-Guard</HI> Tenure of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, and paid a subsidia∣rie Supply for them in the fourth year of that Prince, at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> his Daughter; from which temporary Assessement or Contribution, severall Parcels of Land in this County have ever since contracted the Name of <HI>Blanch-Lands.</HI> In <HI>Alkham</HI> the Signorie of both Places did reside, untill the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then they were demised by <HI>Peter Alkham</HI> to <HI>Iohn Warren</HI> Gentleman; in which Name after they had continued untill the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, <HI>Malmains</HI> was passed away to <HI>Brown,</HI> who in our Memory conveyed it by Sale to <HI>Lushinton;</HI> and <HI>Hollmeade</HI> was by the same Vicissitude annexed to the Demeasn of <HI>Wollet,</HI> a Name that is grown reverend by an Efflux of many Ages both here and at <HI>Elham.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Hoptons,</HI> another place considerable in <HI>Alkham.</HI> If you will search who was in elder Times possest of it, the private date, lesse Deeds will inform you, that anciently it was the Inheritance of <HI>Peter de Hall,</HI> but was not long perma∣nent in the possession of this Name, for in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, (as appears by the Book of Aid) it was the Inheritance of <HI>William de Bourn;</HI> and here it seems the Title was more constant, for in this Family it was resident untill the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Baker</HI> of <HI>Caldham,</HI> in whom it had not long continued, but by his Daughter and Coheir it became the Inheritance of <HI>Robert Brandred,</HI> from which Name about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth it passed away by Sale to <HI>Brown</HI> of <HI>Bechworth Castle</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and here it fixed, untill that Age which came within the Verge of our Grandfathers Remembrance, and then it was demised to <HI>Godman,</HI> in whose Descendants the Propriety now continues.</P>
<P><HI>Evering</HI> is the last place of Account in <HI>Alkham,</HI> it was the possession of a Family so called which branched from the ancient Lords of <HI>Folkston,</HI> sirnamed <HI>Averenches,</HI> whose Armes were (as is manifest by ancient Armorials) <HI>Or</HI> five <HI>Cheverons Gules,</HI> and these <HI>Everings,</HI> bare <HI>Or</HI> five <HI>Cheverons Azure. Wolwardus de Evering</HI> held it under the Notion and by the Service of a whole Knights Fee, in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, of the Lords of <HI>Folkston.</HI> And by a successive Chanell of many Descents hath the Title flowed so constantly in this Family, that this Seat is at this instant annexed to their Inheritance.</P>
<P>In this Parish is an <HI>Eyle-Bourn</HI> which rises in the bottome at <HI>Dillingore,</HI> which the Inhabitants presage to be a fatall presage either of Death or Dearth; and in a short Distance of Time and Place, from no appearance of Head or Spring, sends forth such store of Water that a Vessell of considerable Burden may float therein; then the Wa∣ter being inforced into a Stream runs down to <HI>Chilton,</HI> and disgorges it self into that River, which meets the Sea at <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Apuldore</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackborn,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1032. was by an es∣peciall Licence first obtained from <HI>Canutus</HI> and <HI>Elfgiva</HI> his Queen, and given by <HI>Eadsin</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="28"/>Bishop of Sr. <HI>Martins</HI> without <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to the Prior and Monks of <HI>Christchurch, &amp; est de cibo corum,</HI> says the Book of that Convent; that is, it was granted to them for a Supportation of Diet. In the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third there was a License granted to the then Archbishop, and others by his Royall Patent, <HI>obsternere quendam antiquam Trencheam, quae ducit a Brachio Maris vocato Apledore versus Villam de Romney,</HI> those are the Words of the Record; that is, to intercept and dam up a certain Trench or Chanell which proceeds from an Arm of the Sea called <HI>Apledore,</HI> (for then it seems the Sea flow'd up to this place, though now it have wholly deserted it) and leads to the Town of <HI>Romney;</HI> But to proceed, <HI>Apledore</HI> having by the abovesaid Donation been link'd to the Ecclesiasticall Patrimony, continued wrapp'd up in that Interest, untill the Resignation of the Revenue of the Priorie of <HI>Christchurch,</HI> into the hands of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then he setled it by a new grant on his new erected Dean and Chapter of <HI>Christ Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hornes place</HI> in this Parish was the Seat for many hundreds of years of Gentlemen of that Sirname. <HI>William Horne</HI> was one of the Conservators of the <HI>Peace</HI> in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second for this County, and <HI>Michael Horne</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Apledore,</HI> and from him did the proprietie of this place descend to <HI>Anne Horne</HI> the last of this Name, who matched with <HI>Benedict Guldford</HI> Esquire, who in her Right, as being the sole Inheritrix of this place, became Lord of this Seat, but he denying the Oath of Supremacy, which began about the twelfth and thirteenth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to be tendered to Romish Recusants, and sheltring himselfe by a Recesse and Flight into forrein Parts, fell under the displeasure of the Queen, and his Estate under the Fury of a <HI>praemu∣nire;</HI> so that this Mannor was torne away from his Interest by a Confiscation of it to the Crown, and shortly after the above mentioned Princesse granted it to her faithfull Servant <HI>George Chowte</HI> Esquire, from whom it is now descended to his great Grandchild Mr. <HI>Edward Chowt</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lately De∣ceased.</NOTE> Esquire, a Person who for his Support of Learning in these Times, (wherein if some whose Palates do decline it with regret and disgust, might be confirmed in that licencious Liberty which they pretend to, they would scarce leave us the Title page, to inform Posterity, that their was once Religion or Lear∣ning inhabiting amongst us,) cannot be mentioned by the Fautors and Abettors of Literature, or at least the Pretenders to it, without some grateful acknowledgment.</P>
<P><HI>Dean Court</HI> in this Parish was the Mansion of a Family who borrowed their Sir∣name from this Town, and were called <HI>Apledore,</HI> and sealed with a Pile surmounted with a Fesse, which was their paternal Coat, but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family found its Sepulcher in a Female Heir, for <HI>Thomas de Apledore,</HI> dying witout Issue, <HI>Elnith</HI> his only Sister entituled her husband <HI>William Roper</HI> to his Estate here, and in the confining Marsh; and by an uninterrupted Right derived from this Alliance, hath the title of this place been supported in the Family of <HI>Roper,</HI> for so many Descents, that it is now at last devolved to the right honorable <HI>Christopher Roper</HI> Baron of <HI>Tenham,</HI> in whom it is at this instant resident.</P>
<P>There was a Castle anciently here at <HI>Apledore,</HI> which when the <HI>Danes</HI> in the reign of <HI>Etheldred</HI> Father of <HI>Edmund Ironside,</HI> made this County the Scene of their Devastations, was mingled by the flame they put it into, in the year 892. in its own Rubbish, yet like a <HI>Phaenix,</HI> it rose into new shape and frame again, out of its Ashes, and continued in the Register and under the notion of the Castles and Fortresses of this County, until the year, 1380. and then (as <HI>How</HI> relates in his Chronicle, who likewise represents the former Tragedie,) the <HI>French</HI> making an hostile Eruption on this part of the County, made it once more a pitied and calamitous heap of flame and ruine; out of whose dis∣mantled reliques (the Church now visible was not only repaired, but as some from an∣cient Tradition affirm, wholly reedified; a probable Argument of the ancient Gran∣deur, Magnificence and Strength of this now totally-demolished Fortresse.</P>
<P>I had almost omitted the Mannor of <HI>Frenchay,</HI> which likewise lies within the Cir∣cle of <HI>Apledore,</HI> and had in elder Times, as appears by old evidences, Owners of that Sirname; but the greatest Glory that it atchieved, was, that ever since the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, untill the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it acknowledged the Family of <HI>Haut</HI> for its Proprietaries, the last of which was Sir <HI>William Haut,</HI> who con∣cluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof <HI>Joan</HI> the youngest matched to Sir
<PB N="44" REF="29"/><HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> shared his estate at this place, but he being attainted in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> this was confiscated to the Crown, and lay there untill the twenty fourth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was granted back to <HI>George Wiat</HI> Esquite, whose Son Sir <HI>Francis Wiat,</HI> not many years since, passed it away to <HI>Thomas Floyd</HI> of <HI>Gore-court</HI> in <HI>Otham</HI> Esquire, and he in the year 1636 alienated it to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> of <HI>Tunstall</HI> Knight Baronet, whose Grandchild Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> is now in possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Apledore</HI> had anciently a Market to be observed here weekly, granted to it, by <HI>Edward</HI> the third in the thirty second year of his reign, which since is vanished into Disuse by Intermission.</P>
<P><HI>Adisham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Downhamford,</HI> was given to the Monks of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> (as appears by <HI>Christ Church</HI> Book) by <HI>Ethelbald</HI> Son of <HI>Ethelbald</HI> King of <HI>Kent, Anno Domini</HI> 616. <HI>Cum Campis, Silvis, Pascuis, &amp;c.</HI> (as the Record mentions) <HI>ad illam pertinentibus, ad Cibum Monachorum Ecclesiae Christi Cantuariae, liberam ab omnibus servitiis, &amp; fiscali Tributo exceptis tribus istis Consuetudinibus, id est, Communi Labore, de quo nullus excipiatur Pontis Constructione, vel Arcis;</HI> and whereas we frequently trace in ancient Chartularies these three Letters <HI>L. S. A.</HI> which may at first ap∣pearance seem to wrap up some gloomy and mysterious sense, they import no more but this, that Lands which were given by Charter to the Church should be <HI>Liberae sicut Adisham,</HI> that is, be fortified with the same Franchises and Liberties as <HI>Adisham</HI> Originally was. The <HI>Austins</HI> for some Hundreds of years have been Tenants for this and the Mannor of <HI>Godmersham</HI> to the Church, as if to improve and gratifie the Memory of <HI>Augustin</HI> their first Abbot the Monks of <HI>Christ Church</HI> were determined to plant some of their Patrimony in that Name, though perhaps but of accidental Coincidence.</P>
<P><HI>Aldington</HI> is the next place to be remembred in the Hundred of <HI>Street,</HI> and <HI>Bircholt Franchise</HI> more eminent, because here are chosen the Officers yearly relating to the Mannors of <HI>Romney Mersh.</HI> Queen <HI>Edgiva</HI> mother to King <HI>Edmund,</HI> and King <HI>Edred</HI> gave this Town to <HI>Christ Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in Grosse with other Lands <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 961. But in the General Survey of the Churches Lands in the Conquerours Time, the Arch-Bishops had twenty one Sullings or Plough-Lands there, and was valued together with the Appurtenances at <HI>Stouting</HI> and <HI>Lyming</HI> at 107 <HI>l.</HI> and 25 Burgesses held of it. The Arch-Bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> did usually retire to their Mannor-house here, and had both a Park empailed, and a Chase for Deer, called <HI>Aldington Frith,</HI> by which Name we express Places where Deer ranged at large, as in a Forrest. But when the Kings of <HI>England</HI> intended to pare off something of the Revenue and Power of the Arch-Bishops, which was in their Estimate of too vast and wide an Extent; this Mannor, with many other, was passed away by Exchange to the Crown in the twenty ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ruffins-Hill</HI> in this Parish, was the Seat of the <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s ancient Gentlemen, whose Estate by two Daughters and Coheirs came to the <HI>Clerks</HI> of <HI>Kingsnoth,</HI> and the <HI>Blechen∣dens.</HI> But whether descended from <HI>Godfrey le Falconer</HI> the Son of <HI>Balder,</HI> unto whom K. <HI>Henry</HI> the second assigned, gave, and granted much Land in these Parts, to hold in Serjeantie, by the Service of keeping two Hawks for the King and his Successors, I cannot positively say. Much of the Land lay in <HI>Hurst,</HI> and the Mannor is called <HI>Falconers Hurst;</HI> and those that for many Generations held it, resolved into the Name of <HI>Michel-Grove;</HI> whose Heir General brought this and other fair Demeasns to <HI>Shelley</HI>'s Ancestor of <HI>Michel-Grove,</HI> in whose Name it resides at present. The Coat very well alluded to their ancient Name and Tenure, and is Quarterly <HI>Argent</HI> and <HI>Azure</HI> over all a <HI>Falcon Or. Hurst</HI> was formerly a Parish; and the Church was dedicated to St. <HI>Leonard,</HI> but it is now languished into Decay and Ruine, and the Inhabitants assemble for the Performance of divine Offices at <HI>Aldington.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ainsford</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Axtane</HI> lieth upon the River of <HI>Darent,</HI> and gave Seat and Sirname to a worthy Family that continued till the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the second:
<PB N="45" REF="29"/>It hath the Ruines of an ancient Castle, which reckons them and the <HI>Arsicks</HI> to have been the Founders.</P>
<P>There is another Seat in this Parish of venerable Antiquity, called, <HI>Arkesden,</HI> whose owners bore the same for their Sirname, and were of the Number of the Grand Assise in King <HI>John</HI>'s Time; after them the <HI>Cobhams</HI> were possessors of it, and <HI>Reginald de Cobham</HI> had License the fourteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to Castelate his House, and paid respect of Aid for the same the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight: From the <HI>Cobhams</HI> of <HI>Sterborough</HI> it came by the Heir General to the Lord <HI>Burgh</HI> or <HI>Borough,</HI> from whom by Sale it devolved its Right on Sir <HI>Samuel Leonard</HI> Father of Sir <HI>Stephen Leonard,</HI> which Sir <HI>Stephen</HI> enjoys it at this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Southcourt</HI> and <HI>Mayfield</HI> are two Mannors lying in the Precincts of this Parish, and did anciently relate to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> from whom by exchange they passed over to <HI>Dunham,</HI> and from that Family to the <HI>Wiats,</HI> in which Name and Family they remained, till upon the Attainder of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat</HI> they escheated to the Crown, which by Grant invested their Right and Interest in <HI>J. Leonard</HI> of <HI>Chevening,</HI> from whom they are now come down to be the Possession of Sir <HI>Stephen Leonard</HI> of <HI>West Wickham.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet another ancient Seat within the Verge of this Village, whose Name is <HI>Maplescombe,</HI> and partly is situated in this, and partly in <HI>Kingsdown.</HI> This place although it now carry a desolate Aspect by reason of its Ruine and Depopulation, was anciently of a high Repute and Estimate. <HI>William de Chellerfield</HI> (he whom I suppose lies enter'd in <HI>Halsted</HI> Church) held it (as <HI>Testa de Nevil</HI> informs me,) in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, but his Family had not been possest of it untill the latter End of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, when the Vicissicude of Sale carried the Title off to <HI>Rokesley</HI> of <HI>Rokesley</HI> in <HI>North-Crey,</HI> and <HI>Roger</HI> the Son of <HI>Thomas de Rokesley</HI> held the Lordship by a whole Knights Fee in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, of <HI>Richard de Rosse</HI> of <HI>Horton Kerkbie,</HI> and he held it of the Successor of <HI>Robert de Arsick,</HI> and he of the King; yet I find some part of it to have acknow∣ledged the Signorie of the Family of <HI>Merworth,</HI> for <HI>Roger de Merworth</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Lands at this place; and in the fortieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John de Merworth,</HI> this Mans Grandchild, was by purchase wholly invested in the Possession, and held it at his Decease, which was in the forty ninth year of that Prince, and <HI>John de Malmains</HI> was his Heir, who passed it away to <HI>Nicholas de Brember,</HI> of whom I shall speak more at <HI>Merworth;</HI> and he being attainted in the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, there was a return made in the twelfth of that Prince, that he held this Mannor at his Conviction, upon which that Prince in the thirteenth year of his Reign grants it to <HI>John de Hermensthorpe,</HI> and he not long after passed it away to <HI>Richard Fitz-Allen</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> and his Son <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> dying without Issue Male 1416. <HI>Joan</HI> one of his Sisters and Coheits brought it to be the Possession of her Husband <HI>Will. Beauchamp</HI> Baron of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> whose Son likewise dying without Issue Male in the ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his sole Inheritrix united it to the Patrimony of <HI>Edward Nevil,</HI> and in his Descendants did the Title remain, untill our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Lovelace,</HI> and is now by <HI>Margaret</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>Richard Lovelace</HI> annexed to the Demeasn of Mr. ....... <HI>Cooke</HI> of <HI>Lanham</HI> in <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Easthall</HI> in this Parish was parcel of the Revenue of <HI>Rokesley</HI> of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> but when Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley</HI> determined with the Name in a Female Inheritrix, She, by matching with Sir <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> entituled that Name to the Proprietie and Jurisdiction of this place, in which Family it continued untill the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it being found after a serious Inquisition, that Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> who deceased the twelfth year of that Princes Government, had neither lawful Issue, nor any Collateral Alliance, which could start a Title to his Estate, it escheated to the Crown in, whose Demeasn this Mannor was locked up untill King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted it to Sir <HI>Roger Cholmeley,</HI> who sud∣denly alienated his Interest here to Sir <HI>Martin Bowes;</HI> and he the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, conveyed it again to <HI>Percival Hart</HI> of <HI>Lullingston</HI> Esquire, in
<PB N="46" REF="30"/>whose Successor, Mr. <HI>William Hart</HI> of <HI>Lullingston</HI> Esquire, the Title is now resident.</P>
<P><HI>Littlemote</HI> and <HI>Petham</HI> are two Mannors likewise in this Parish, which augmented the Revenue of <HI>Sibell,</HI> a Family of deep Antiquity as any in this Track, who were for many Hundred years possest of <HI>Petham,</HI> and of the House which is called <HI>Little∣mote</HI> likewise, as is evident by their Coat Armour <HI>viz.</HI> a Tiger viewing himself in a Mirrour, or Spigel, both carved and embossed very anciently in Wood, as like∣wise represented to the view in old coloured Glass, though much of the Land that relates to this Mansion devolved to <HI>Sibel</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, by the Heir of <HI>Cowdale,</HI> whose Arms, <HI>viz. Arg.</HI> a <HI>Cheveron, Gules</HI> between three <HI>Bulls Heads Cabosed Sables,</HI> both empailed and quartered with this Family, are yet visible in many Places of the House; finally, after these two Places had so many Descents been fastned to this Family, they came down at last to <HI>John Sibel</HI> Esquire, who concluded in a Female Heir called <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> matched to Mr. <HI>Robert Bosvil</HI> An∣cestor to <HI>Thomas Bosvil</HI> Esquire, who in Right of this Alliance is now Heir ap∣parent to the Signorie of them.</P>
<P>There is one part of the Church is called <HI>Arsicks Chancel,</HI> and divers Lands here∣abouts are held of the Honour of <HI>Arsick</HI> by Knights Service, and <HI>Robert de Arsick</HI> that came in with <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, was one of those that were Assistants to <HI>John de Fiennes</HI> for the securer Guard of <HI>Dover.</HI> Castle. He had eighteen Knights Fees assigned to him, of which these lay in <HI>Kent, viz. Fremingham (idest) Farningham,</HI> one Knights Fee, <HI>Mayplescombe</HI> one Knights Fee, <HI>Nutstted</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> one Knights Fee, <HI>Combe</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> one Knights Fee, <HI>Bekewel</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> one Knights Fee. The rest lay most in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and some in <HI>Dorset, Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Ma∣nasser de Arsick</HI> was of eminent Note in the County of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> in describing that County, affirms the principal Seat of their Barony to be at <HI>Coggs,</HI> and that the Daughter and Heir was married to <HI>Hubert de Burgo,</HI> who was Earl of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alhallows</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> with the appendant Mannor of <HI>Shawsted,</HI> did an∣ciently celebrate the Memory of <HI>Delapole; John De la Pole</HI> held it in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and paid a respective supply for it at making the Black Prince Knight, and in this Family was the possession permanent untill the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was transmitted by sale to <HI>Zouch</HI> of <HI>Haringworth,</HI> writ∣ten in ancient Court Rolls and other Muniments <HI>De la Zouch;</HI> and here the Title was resident untill it was by Descent wafted along to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>De la Zouch,</HI> who being a great Assertor of the Cause and Quarrel of <HI>Richard</HI> the third against <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, like some noble Fabrick, in whose Joints the Raine hath dwelt, and supplanted the Contextures of its Pillars, fell under the Misfortune of his Royal Master, and sunk in the Ruines of the fatal Field of <HI>Bosworth,</HI> and in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, being attainted by Parliament, his Patrimony escheated to the Crown, and then that Prince granted his Estate here to his faithful Partisan, Sir <HI>Henry Wiat,</HI> whom he had newly taken into his private Councels, and from him did it successively come down to his Grandchild Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> whose Estate here was much improved and augmented by the Addition of <HI>Windlehill,</HI> another Mannor in this Parish, which as appears <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Place House</HI> in this Parish is secondly to be remembred, which was anciently part of the Demeasn of the illustrious Family of the <HI>Pimps</HI> of <HI>Pimps Court</HI> in the Pa∣rish of <HI>Loose</HI> near <HI>Maidston,</HI> and <HI>Philip de Pimp</HI> was one of those Men at Arms which the Prior of <HI>Rochester</HI> was to furnish out for the Guard of the Seacoast at

<P><HI>Alresford</HI> anciently written <HI>Aiglesford</HI> hath Places of considerable Animadversion within the Limits and Boundaries of it.

Upon the suppression it was granted with the Royalty of it by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> from whom it descended to his Son Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> upon whose Defection, this being with other Lands escheated to the Crown, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it to Mr. <HI>J.

Palmer</HI> of the <HI>Courtlodge</HI> in <HI>Snodland</HI> Esquire; whose Posterity after they had held them some space of Time, sold them to <HI>Warcup,</HI> descended from the <HI>Warcups</HI> of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> in which Name the Tenure was not long resident, for by Sale it was alienated to <HI>Sidley</HI> of <HI>Southfleet,</HI> and his Successor suddenly after by the like Fatalitie invested <HI>Ricaut</HI> in <HI>Eccles,</HI> and <HI>Madox</HI> in <HI>Tottington.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cosington</HI> is a Seat of much Eminence in this Parish, and gave Residence and Sir-name to a Knightly Familie of the same. And King <HI>Edward</HI> the first rewarded Sir <HI>Stephen de Cosenton</HI> whom he had made Banneret in the twenty eighth of his Reign, for his signal Service at <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with a Charter of Free Warren to all his Lands at <HI>Cosenton Acris,</HI> and <HI>South-Burton</HI> vulgarly called <HI>South-Blabden</HI> in <HI>Elham</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI> The Mannor it self holdeth by Knights Service of the Barony of <HI>Rosse</HI> of <HI>Horton Kirbie,</HI> from whom they received it by ancient Feoffement, and bear in similitude of their Lords the <HI>Rosses,</HI> the same Charge in their Arms, <HI>viz. Azure</HI> three <HI>Roses Or.</HI> The Arms of <HI>Rosse</HI> being <HI>Or</HI> three <HI>Roses Gules;</HI> But when in the Beginning of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighths Government, the Fatality of Time had concluded this Family in three Daugh∣ters and Coheirs married to <HI>Duke, Hamon,</HI> and <HI>Wood;</HI> this Mannor of <HI>Cosenton</HI> accrued by Co-partition to <HI>Duke,</HI> in which Name it hath ever since resided. There was a <HI>Free Chappel</HI> belonging to this Mansion founded, as private Evidences advertise me, by Sir <HI>Stephen de Cosenton,</HI> which is now crumbled into so desolate an Heap of Rubbish, that we can hardly trace out its Ruines even amidst its Ruines. There was another <HI>Free Chappel</HI> in his Parish annexed to <HI>Tottington</HI> by <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Poynings</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Rich.</HI> the second, which hath been so dismantled by the impressions of Time, and the fury of the Elements, that there is very little Testimony or Evidence re∣maining that this Oratorie ever had a Being.</P>
<P><HI>Preston</HI> in this Parish of <HI>Alresford</HI> is a Seat of that venerable Antiquity, and hath for so many Descents been incorporated into the Demeasn of <HI>Colepeper,</HI> that it is questionable which is the ancient Cradle or Seminary of this Family either <HI>Bayhall</HI> in <HI>Pepenbury,</HI> or <HI>Preston</HI> in <HI>Alresford;</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> as the old Evidences and
<PB N="48" REF="31"/>Muniments of this Name instruct me, was of this Family, and was Governour of <HI>Winchelsey</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> the second, by whom he was beheaded for defending that Town in behalf of the Barons then combined in an hostile League against him: <HI>Walter de Colepeper</HI> flourished under <HI>Edward</HI> the first and <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and seal'd with a <HI>Bend engrailed,</HI> which is still the paternal Coat-Armour of this Family; which I the rather mention, because these Deeds are the first of that Nature which I have seen since Sealing with Coats of Arms grew customary in this Nation, and argues him to be a Man of eminence in this County, as did that spreading Revenue likewise of which he died possest, not onely here, but at <HI>Farleigh, Peckham, Wrotham,</HI> and divers other places, in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>John Colepeper</HI> was a Judge in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and concluded in a Daughter and Heir, who by matching with <HI>Harrington,</HI> added a considerable Supplement to the paternal Revenue of that noble Family. I shall not more dilate my self in this Discourse, it is enough that I inform the Reader, that this ancient Seat which hath been for so many Centuries of years under the Signorie of this Name, is yet so constant to the Interest of this Family, that it is at this instant knit to the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Richard Colepeper</HI> Knight and Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Roes Place</HI> in <HI>Alresford</HI> pretends to a deep Root in Antiquity likewise, as being the Seat and Original of the ancient Family of <HI>Roe,</HI> and from hence the <HI>Roes</HI> of <HI>Chafford</HI> in <HI>Ashurst,</HI> those of <HI>Essex,</HI> and he that was Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> have primitively in a full Channel flowed out; and in this Family was the possession lodged, untill that Age we style our Grandfathers, and then it was carried off by Sale to <HI>Taylor;</HI> which Family not many years since concluding in a Female Inheritrix, She by matching with <HI>Warcup,</HI> hath espoused the possession of this place to that Name and Family.</P>
<P>Near this place, <HI>Vortimer</HI> the valiant British King gave Battle to <HI>Hengist</HI> the Saxon, after he had given a Victorious overthrow to the Britons at <HI>Creyford;</HI> in which conflict <HI>Horsa</HI> and <HI>Catigern,</HI> Brethrento both the Generals, were stain, and the Saxons repulsed into the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> their first assigned Habitation, not daring to enter and reinvade the Continent whilest <HI>Vortimer</HI> survived. <HI>Catigern</HI> was interr'd in that Plain which spreads it self on the Hanging of that Hill, which looks down on <HI>Cosenton,</HI> where to this Day his Monument remains, being four vast Stones pitched somewhat after the Mannor of <HI>Stonehenge</HI> on <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, but of greater Breadth then they, though not so thick or long, whereby it ap∣pears like a small Sheepcote, and is vulgarly styled <HI>Cits-Cotehouse,</HI> which is graphically here intitated. The like Monument was erected for <HI>Horsa</HI> at <HI>Horsted</HI> near <HI>Rochester</HI> which storms and Tempests under the Conduct of Time have utterly extinguished.</P>

<P><HI>Ash</HI> by <HI>Sandwich</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Wingham,</HI> and contains many Places within its Precincts very considerable. The first is <HI>Welmestone,</HI> which is situated partly in this Parish, and partly in <HI>Wingham.</HI> Though it be now obscure, it was in elder Times made more conspicuous, by being one of the Seats of Residence of the Noble Family of <HI>Septuans, William de Septnans</HI> or <HI>Sepuans</HI> was in the possession of it at his Death, which was in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Ese. Num.</HI> 5. and in this Family did the Title of this place by the steps of several Descents pass along untill the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it went from this Family by Exchange for other Land to Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> who not long after conveyed the Demeasn Land or Mansion-House to <HI>Alday,</HI> and the Mannor it self to <HI>Solley;</HI> in <HI>Alday</HI> the demised premises had not been long resident, when they were sold to Mr. <HI>Benedict Barnham,</HI> by one of whose four Coheirs, the Fee-Simple de∣volved to the Earl of <HI>Castlehaven,</HI> whose descendant conveyed it to <HI>Brigham.</HI></P>
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>
<P><HI>Goshall</HI> in this Parish must not be forgotten, it was the Residence anciently of a Family of that Sirname, made more eminent by the production of Sir <HI>John Goshall</HI> a worthy Knight, who flourished in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third and <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and lyes entombed in <HI>Ash Church,</HI> in compleat Armour, and his Skeleton underneath, his Arms are also depicted in his Shield, viz. <HI>Azure</HI> a <HI>Lyon Ram∣pant</HI> within <HI>Semeè</HI> of <HI>Crosse Crosselets Argent.</HI> The Heir Generall of this Family was wedded to St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> of the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> and after the Title had for some Ages setled in this Family, it was by a Daughter and Heir transmitted to <HI>John Dynley</HI> Esquire, whose Descendant about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Roper,</HI> Ancestor to <HI>Christopher Roper</HI> Baron of <HI>Tenham,</HI> who hath lately alienated his Interest in it to Sir <HI>Edw. Monins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Checquers</HI> in this Parish of <HI>Ash,</HI> was a very ancient Seat of a Branch of the Family of <HI>Septuans,</HI> who from their Residence here, contracted the Sirname of <HI>Checquer</HI> or <HI>Atchecquer,</HI> and so were stiled in severall old Records; and after this Mansion had re∣mained a Series of some Generations in the Name of <HI>Septuans</HI> and <HI>Checquer,</HI> it shrunk into a Daughter and Heir matched with <HI>Alday;</HI> in which Family, after it had some Time resided it was by Sale lately passed away to Mr. <HI>Tho. Harfleet,</HI> and now owns his Descendants for its instant Possessors.</P>
<P><HI>Hells Twitham</HI> is swoln up to some Repute since it was the Revenue of the <HI>Hells,</HI> a Family of generous Rank in this County, but stayed not long in the possession, for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, they had surrendered their Interest to <HI>Twitham,</HI> a noble Family, and of deep Extraction, in this Teritory; <HI>Bertram de Twitham</HI> died possest of it in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; <HI>Alanus de Twitham</HI> his Son was likewise found invested in it at his Decease, which was in the twenty fifth year of the abovesaid Prince; and lastly, <HI>Alanus</HI> the Son of <HI>Theobald Twitham</HI> held it in the fourth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and left it to <HI>Mawd</HI> his sole Daughter and Heir, by whom the Title was transplanted into <HI>Simon Septuans,</HI> in whose Family the Proprietie hath for many Ages, even untill this instant, by an unbroken Link been seated.</P>
<P>The next place which obviates my Discovery, is <HI>Overland,</HI> the which in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, was by the Royall Charter of that Prince granted to <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> and so being made Parcell of his Demeasne, it remained fastned to his Interest untill the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and then it was passed away to <HI>Leybourn,</HI> and was held by <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> the Heir generall of <HI>Roger</HI> Lord <HI>Leybourn;</HI> who in relation to that vast Patrimony her Birth intituled her to, might be justly stiled the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> and shee was first espoused to <HI>John de Hastings,</HI> and secondly to <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> who held it at his Death in her Right, which was in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but shee deceased without Issue, in the forty third year of the abovesaid Prince, by either of them, and there being none, that by the strength of any Collaterall Alliance, could pretend any Interest or Title to the Estate, it escheared to the Crown, and lay there untill <HI>Richard</HI> the second bestowed it by Grant on Sir <HI>Simon de Burley</HI> Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque-Ports; but he being attainted in the tenth year of that King, it returned to the Crown again, and then it was by the the same Prince setled on the Abby of <HI>Childrens Langley,</HI> and was involved in the Patrimony of that Cloister, untill the generall Suppression in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was granted in the thirty fifth year of that Prince to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile</HI> and Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> and they not long after conveyed their joynt Interest in it to <HI>Harfleet,</HI> Who almost in our Fathers Remembrance alienated it to <HI>Bargrave,</HI> from whom the same devolution brought it over to <HI>Solley,</HI> who not many years after transmitted it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Jo. Ward</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> whose Widow, Mrs. <HI>Katharin Ward</HI> now holds it in Right of <HI>Dower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Goldstanton</HI> in this Parish is a second place of Note, and was as high as the Beam of any Evidence will guide me to discover the Patrimony of <HI>Leybourn, Roger de Ley∣bourn,</HI> who was in the Register of those Kentish Gentlemen who were pardoned by the Pacification, called <HI>Dictum de Kenelworth,</HI> for seeking to support with seditious Arms the Cause and Quarrell of <HI>Simon de Montfort,</HI> held it in the fiftieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and from him did it descend to his great Grandchild <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> who
<PB N="51" REF="32"/>dying without Issue or Alliance in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this with <HI>Overland</HI> escheated to the Crown, but was granted out again by <HI>Richard</HI> the second to Sir <HI>Simon de Burley,</HI> who being attainted and convicted of high Treason in the tenth year of his Reign, that Prince link'd it by a new Donation to the Abby of <HI>Childrens Langley.</HI> But yet I find that in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Richard Cliderow</HI> (who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the fourth year and most part of the fith year of that Prince, and then again in the sixth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the fifth,) held it I suppose only as a Lessee, and kept his Shrivealty at this Place; a Man he was of no contemptible Account in those Times, as I shall discover more amply at little <HI>Betshanger</HI> which was his capital Seat. But to return, after this Mannor had made its aboad in the Demeasne of the above mentioned Covent, untill the Dissollution in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was then torn off, and granted to <HI>Tho.</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> upon whose Attaint, in the thirty second year of the above said Prince it escheated back to the Crown, and then it was granted in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to <HI>Vincent Engham</HI> Esquire, whose Descendant Sir <HI>Tho. Engham,</HI> some few years transplanted his Con∣cernment in it by Sale into Mr. ......... <HI>Courcelis</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nevills Fleet</HI> in this Parish was more anciently called <HI>Butlers Fleet,</HI> as being parcell of the Revenue of that Family, and the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> in the Exchequer, which makes an enumeration of the ancient Owners, mentions one <HI>Richard de Boteler,</HI> to have been its ancient Possessor; but in the twentienth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, when that Book was taken, <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Latimer</HI> of <HI>Corbie,</HI> Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports held it; and in the thirty eighth ob∣tained by the Charter of that Prince, a Market to be held at <HI>Ark</HI> on the Thursday, and a three days Fair at our Lady Day; and from him, as in divers Records it is evi∣dent, did it acquire the Name of <HI>Latimers Fleet,</HI> but stayed not long under that Title, for he determined in <HI>Eleanor</HI> his Daughter and Heir matched to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Nevill,</HI> who in her Right became Lord of this Mannor, and from him did it contract the Title of <HI>Nevils Fleet,</HI> and lay couched in the Patrimony of this Name untill the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Cromer,</HI> and <HI>James Cromer</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, alienated it to <HI>John Isaac,</HI> from whom not long after it was brought over by Purchase to <HI>Kendall,</HI> and in that Name it fixed, untill the Beginninig of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was alienated to Sir <HI>John Fogge,</HI> and he before the end of that Prince conveyed it to <HI>Ralph,</HI> in which Name it was resident untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was demised to <HI>Spracklin,</HI> and Sir <HI>Adam Spracklin</HI> almost in Times under our Fathers Cognisance passed it away to <HI>Harfleet,</HI> in which Family you may at this instant find it.</P>
<P><HI>Molands</HI> in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, who before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second were worn out, and then it became the possession of <HI>Harfleet, aliás Septuans,</HI> who much improved the House with additional Buildings, where the Arms of this Family do stand yet in <HI>Panes</HI> of very old coloured Glasse, with this Motto annexed, <HI>Dissipabo inimicos Regis mei ut paleam;</HI> alluding either to their Coat, which was <HI>three Fans,</HI> such as they fan and winnow Corn with, or else to <HI>William de Septuans,</HI> who dyed in the year 14011. and warred, as the Records of this Family inform me under <HI>Edward</HI> the third in <HI>France,</HI> and by his Will registred in the Prerogative Office at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> which I mention for the Novelty of it, he gives Manumission or Freedome to diverse of his Slaves or Natives; and Sir <HI>William Septuans</HI> was his Son, who lyes buryed in <HI>Christ Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and as his <HI>Epi∣taph</HI> on his Tomb instructs me, dyed in the year 1448. and from him did the Title stream in this Name, untill the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then I find this Seat in the possession of <HI>Robert Read;</HI> but it was not long out of the Name, for about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> I find it reinvested again in <HI>Harfleet,</HI> and remains an eminent Mansion of this Family at present.</P>
<P>Many of this Sirname lye buryed in <HI>Ash</HI> Church, for those three Altar Tombs in the Church yard, and those on each side the North Dore, were the Repositories or Exchequers, that treasured up the Remains of divers of this Family, all which had their Figures and Arms insculp'd in Brasse, annexed to their Sepulchers, which by the impression of Times, and the Assaults of Sacrilegious Hands are quite dismantled, and torn off.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="33"/>
<P><HI>Wingham Barton</HI> is another eminent Mannor in this Parish, which belonged to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and when <HI>John Peckham</HI> founded his Colledge at <HI>Wingham</HI> in the year 1282. there was an Exhibition setled on that Seminary or Bro∣therhood, issuing out of this Manuor, from whence it is supposed by some it con∣tracted the Name of <HI>Wingham Barton;</HI> though I rather conjecture it was called so from its Situation, in opposition to another of that Name, called <HI>Firmins Barton,</HI> ly∣ing by <HI>Canterbury.</HI> But to proceed, this continued Archiepiscopal, untill the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was exchanged by <HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with the Crown, and rested there, untill Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it to Sir <HI>Roger Manwood,</HI> whose son Sir <HI>Peter Manwood</HI> passed it away by his Trustees not many years since to Sir <HI>William Curteen</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and he gave it in Dower with his daughter matched to <HI>Henry</HI> late Earle of <HI>Kent,</HI> who upon his decease ordered it to be sold to discharge some Debts, and was accordingly not long since by his Countess con∣veyed by Sale to Mr. <HI>James Thurbarne</HI> of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> one of the Cinque Ports, Son of <HI>James Thurbarne</HI> Esquire, a Justice of Peace in this County in the Reign of K. <HI>James,</HI> whose Ancestors from 1331 have continued very eminent in the Cinque Ports, espe∣cially in <HI>Hasting</HI> and <HI>Romney,</HI> as also in <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> as appears by divers ancient Records. But the ancient Mannor-House was in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth granted to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> and his Descendant Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Boughton,</HI> about the Beginning of King <HI>Charles</HI> passed it away to Mr. <HI>Vincent Denn</HI> of <HI>Wenderton,</HI> who gave it to his Nephew Mr. <HI>Thomas Denn,</HI> and he by Testa∣ment setled it on his Brother Mr. <HI>John Denn,</HI> who dying without Issue bequeathed it to be shared by his four Sisters, by whom it is designed to be sold to pay Debts and Legacies.</P>
<P><HI>Chilton</HI> lies likewise in <HI>Ash,</HI> and claims our Remembrance, because it yielded a Seat, and afforded a Sirname to <HI>William de Chilton,</HI> who held it at his Decease, which was in the thirty first year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 19. But after his <HI>Exit,</HI> it dwelt not long in his Name; for in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>William Baude</HI> died seised of it, as appears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 25. And here again the Title was as fickle, and un∣stable, for in the thirty seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find the possession was departed from <HI>Baude,</HI> and cast into the Patrimony of <HI>Thomas Wolton,</HI> who at that Time held it at his Death. <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 13. But after this Family went out, I find the Inheritance more fixed and permanent, for by divers old Court-Rolls that were taken in the latter End of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I discover <HI>William de Septuans</HI> whose successors were since called <HI>Harfleet,</HI> to be possest of it, and from him is the Propriety drawn through the successive Series of many Descents to the <HI>Harfleets</HI> of this Age, who are still entituled to the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hells</HI> is in the Register also of those Mannors which are within the Circle of this Parish, and gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of no shallow Antiquity in this Tract; <HI>Thomas de Hells</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of <HI>Hells</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; <HI>Bertram de Hells</HI> was Lieuetenant of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, under <HI>Reginald</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle: <HI>Gilbert de Hells</HI> of <HI>Hells Court,</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the thirtieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and in this Name did the Proprietie lodge untill the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then it was by sale transplanted into <HI>Wroth;</HI> and the Title there setled untill the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was by the same Vicissitude carried off to <HI>Peake,</HI> where the instant Inheritance is resident.</P>
<P><HI>Laverocks</HI> is another Seat in <HI>Ash,</HI> possest by Worthy Men of that Name, one of them lies buried Cross legged on the <HI>North</HI>-side of the Quire, with his Arme placed on his Shield; finally, after this Family had for Descents been Proprietaries of this place, it came to be possest by <HI>Anthony Laverock</HI> who deceased with∣out Issue Male, so that his Estate here came the eighteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh by <HI>Parnel</HI> his Daughter and Heir, to be possest, by <HI>Edward Monins</HI> Esquire, and they both not long after passed it away to <HI>Peake,</HI> in whose Posterity and Name, the Title is yet remaining.</P>
<P><HI>Fleet</HI> is the last Mannor in <HI>Ash,</HI> which is ennobled by having as (high as any Track of Record can guide us to a Discovery) the Earls of <HI>Oxford</HI> for Proprietaries; <HI>Hugh de Vere</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the forty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 26. After him it came down to <HI>Robert de Vere</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> his Son, and he likewise enjoyed it at his Departure, which was in the twenty fourth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 62. In the fifth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third <HI>Robert de Vere</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> was possessed of it at his Decease; <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 71. In Ages of a nearer Approach unto us, <HI>Robert de Vere</HI> Duke of <HI>Ireland</HI> and Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> held it, but he attempting to support the waning and declining Prerogative of <HI>Richard</HI> the second against the Assaults which some of the potent Nobility endevoured to make upon it, in the tenth year of that Princes Government, was ruined in a Battle commenced near <HI>Burford,</HI> after which he attempting to decline the Fury of that Field by Flight, was infortunately drowned. After whose untimely Decease this Mannor being folded up in the rest of his Estate, was seised upon as forfeited to the Crown in the sixteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc.</HI> 34. <HI>Parte secunda.</HI> But it seems it was restored by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, for <HI>Matilda</HI> this Mans Mother, wife of <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> held it at her Death, which was in the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 17. from it passed along to <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who so vigorously asserted the Interest of the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Barnet,</HI> where his Valour was ruinous to him, for his Army was discomfited, and the great Leader of that Day, the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> disdaining to out-live so black and finister a Mis-fortune, found his Sepulcher in the Carnage of that Field, but he was reserved for better Times, having provided for his safety by a timely Escape; he was afterwards attainted in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 28. and this Mannor as an Escheat annexed to the Royal Revenue, where it made its abode untill the first year of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then that Prince after <HI>Bosworth</HI> Field (where he obtained both the Crown and Victory together, prin∣cipally by the Courage and Conduct of the above mentioned Earl) restored this Mannor to this worthy Person, as a guerdon of so great Obligations; and in this Family did it afterwards without any Interruption continue untill the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then <HI>Gurson,</HI> which was a principal part of it, was sold by <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to <HI>Hamon,</HI> and the Residue of this Mannor to <HI>Peyton</HI> and <HI>Harfleet;</HI> in which Families the Interest of this Mannor thus resolved and split into Parcels is at this instant resident.</P>

<P>If you will hear more of this Castle, I shall represent it to you as <HI>Leland</HI> describes it in the thirtieth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, at which Time he visited several Parts of this County: The Site of the old Town or Castle (sayes he) is wonderful fair upon a Hill, the Walls which remain there yet be in compass about almost as much as the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> they have been very high, thick, strong, and well embattled, the Matter of them is Flint, marvailous and long Bricks, both white and red, of the British Fashion; The Ciment was made of the Sea, and small pibble. There is a great likelyhood that the goodly Hill about the Castle, and especially towards <HI>Sandwich</HI> hath been well inhabited, Corn gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws there in marvailous plenty; and in going to Plough, there hath been Time out of Mind, and now is, found more Antiquities of Romane Money, then in any place else of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<PB N="54" REF="34"/>
<P>Surely Reason speaks that this should be <HI>Rutupinum,</HI> for besides the Name some∣what toucheth, the very near passage from <HI>Calis</HI> Cliffs, or <HI>Calis,</HI> was to <HI>Ratesborough</HI> and now is to <HI>Sandwich,</HI> which is about a Mile off, though now <HI>Sandwich</HI> be not celebrated, because of <HI>Goodwin Sands,</HI> and the Decay of the Haven: There is a good Flight shot off from <HI>Ratesborough</HI> toward <HI>Sandwich,</HI> a great Dike cast in a round Compass, as if it had been for Defence of Men of War, the Compass of the Ground within is not much above an Acre, and it is very hollow by casting up the Earth; They call this place their Little <HI>Borough,</HI> within the Castle is a little Paroch Church of St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> and an Hermitage; I had Antiquities of the <HI>Hermit,</HI> who is an Industri∣ous Man; not far from the <HI>Hermitage</HI> is a Cave where Men have sought and digged for Treasure, I saw it by Candle within, wherein were Conies, it was so streight, that I had no mind to creep far in. In the <HI>North</HI>-side of the Castle is an Head in the Wall, now sore defaced by the weather, they call it Q. <HI>Berthas</HI> Head; near to that place, hard by the Wall, was a Pot of Roman Money lately found. Thus far He. The Ancient Lords of the Castle were the Earls of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Ox∣ford</HI> in the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> alienated it to <HI>Gant.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ash juxta Faukham,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> anciently written <HI>Clacstane,</HI> and was in elder Times the Inheritance of the <HI>Latimers, William de Latimer</HI> held it in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and by the Royal Indulgence of that Prince obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of <HI>Ash</HI> which he held of <HI>Roger de Mowbray.</HI> After the <HI>Latimers</HI> were worn out, the noble Family of <HI>Grandison</HI> succeeded in the possession, and <HI>Otho de Grandison</HI> held it, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, by the fourth part of a Knights Fee: But after this, there is little Evidence that it was long constant to the Interest of this Family, for in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it was wrapped up in the Demeasn of <HI>Cressel,</HI> a Family that were entituled to a large Revenue, both at <HI>Chiselhurst, Hartley,</HI> and elsewhere in this Track, but it seems took no deep root at this place, for in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the Knights Hospitalers held it at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch,</HI> that Princes Daughter, but whether they had it by Purchase or Exchange from <HI>Cressell,</HI> the Record in the Exche∣quer does not specifie; and here it became fixed and was esteemed as one of the principal Mannors relating to their Order in this County, untill the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, and then in the thirty seventh year of that Prince, not without much contest and strugling, this was with the rest of their Revenue surrendred, and being made parcel of the Income of the Crown, K. <HI>Edw.</HI> the sixth about the second year of his Reign granted it to Sir <HI>Martin Bowes,</HI> and he had Issue <HI>Will. Bowes,</HI> who determined in two Daughters and Coheirs; <HI>Eliz.</HI> matched to <HI>Will. Buggin,</HI> and <HI>Ann</HI> married to Sir <HI>Edmund Fowler,</HI> who divided his Patrimony; and this upon the partition, was united to the Revenue of <HI>Fowler,</HI> and continues still to acknowledge his descendants for Proprietaries.</P>
<P><HI>South-Ash</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which had Owners in elder Times of that Name, for in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> I find that <HI>John</HI> at <HI>South-Ash</HI> paid an auxiliary supply for his Mannor of <HI>South-Ash</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight; but it is possible this Mans original Name was <HI>Hodsoll,</HI> and borrowed this Name from the Situation and Position of his Habitation, which was <HI>Southerly;</HI> and that which induces me to this Conjecture is, that upon a perusall of the original Evidences, I find that the Family of <HI>Hodsoll,</HI> was long before possessors of this Mannor, a particular Se∣ries of whom I could discover to the Reader, but that I will not clog this Treatise with superfluities, nor is this Mannor departed from the Signorie of this Name, but is at this instant involved in the patrimony of Mr. <HI>William Hodsoll.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hodsoll</HI> and <HI>Halywell</HI> are two other little Mannors in <HI>Ash,</HI> whereof the last hath been the Seat of <HI>Hodsoll,</HI> who borrowed their Sirname from the first many hundred years; and in Relation to this assumed the bearing of three Stone Fountains, two and one, such as used to be dedicated to some Saint, and were frequented an∣ciently by such who reposed any Confidence in his vertue and miraculous efficacie, whose Name they bore; and of this Figure was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Stone Well at <HI>Brackley</HI> com∣monly called St. <HI>Rumbals Well,</HI> much frequented in the misty Times of Popery, for the Cure of sore Eyes, and other Maladies, and that this was the ancient Coat of
<PB N="55" REF="34"/>this Family is most certain, for <HI>William Hodsoll,</HI> who in severall Deeds writ himself Esquire, both in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, sealed with the <HI>three stone Fountains</HI> only; but now I know not upon what consideration the <HI>Fesse Wavee</HI> is added; so that that the Coat is now <HI>Azure a Fesse Wavee</HI> between <HI>three stone Fountains Argent:</HI> But to proceed, as <HI>Hodsoll</HI> and <HI>Halywell</HI> have for so many Gene∣rations owned the Title of that Name and Family, so hath no Vicissitude of Time so carryed off the Propriety of them, but that they are still the present Demeasne of Mr. <HI>William Hodsoll.</HI></P>
<P><HI>North-Ash</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which hath been accounted a Limb of the great Mannor of St. <HI>Johns</HI> at <HI>Sutton</HI> at <HI>Hone,</HI> and upon the Suppression of the Al∣berge of the Knights Hospitallers here in <HI>England,</HI> who for many hundreds of years had owed this Mannor, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted to Sir <HI>Maurice Dennis,</HI> by whose Coheir it came to <HI>Wrote,</HI> and he passed it away to <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Esquire, who upon his Decease gave it to his second Son Sir <HI>Tho. Smith,</HI> in whose Descendants the Interest of it is wrapped up at present.</P>
<P><HI>Scotgrove</HI> is the last place of Account in <HI>Ash,</HI> it was in Ages of a very high Ascent, the Estate of a Family called <HI>Torpell. Mabilia Torpell,</HI> Widow of <HI>John de Torpell,</HI> who held it in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, dyed in the enjoyment of it, in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 27. In Times of a lower Gradation, I find this Family vanished, and then this Mannor came to be under the Signorie of <HI>Catwick,</HI> and <HI>John de Catwick</HI> held it, and paid respective Aid for it; (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) at making the black Prince Knight. After this Family had de∣serted the possession of this place, I discover by some old Deeds that Commence from the Reign of <HI>Rich.</HI> the second, that the <HI>Frankenhams</HI> were Lords of the Fee, who before the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth were gon out, and then it came to own the Propriety of <HI>Poynings,</HI> and went along with this Name untill it devolved to Sir <HI>Edward Poyning,</HI> who had it in possession at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and after a solemne and signall Inquisition taken in the fourteenth year of that Monarch, to discover if there could be traced out any collaterall Alliance (for he dyed without any lawfull Issue) that could justifie a Claim to his Estate, and there none appearing who could do it, this Mannot with much other land escheated to the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince granted this to <HI>William Lewknor</HI> Esquire; in which Family it had not rested many years when it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>Vane,</HI> from whom by the like Vicissitude in that Age we call our Fathers, it came to be the Possession of <HI>Walter</HI> of <HI>Faukham.</HI></P>
<P>The Priorie of St. <HI>Helens</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> had some Interest at <HI>South-Ash,</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, as appears by the Rolls of <HI>Blanch Lands</HI> kept in the Exchequer, but whether upon the Suppression it were wrapped up in the Mannor of <HI>Ash,</HI> and so conveyed in the general Concession or Grant, as being a Perquisite, I am incertain.</P>
<P><HI>Ashford</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> was one of those Mannors which was marshalled under the Jurisdiction and Propriety of the eminent Family of <HI>Crioll; Simon de Crioll,</HI> in the twenty seventh and twenty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, ob∣tained a Charter of Free Warren to his Mannor of <HI>Ashford,</HI> and <HI>Mawde de Crioll</HI> his Widow dyed seised of it in the fifty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it to her Son <HI>Will. de Keriell,</HI> who, as <HI>Will. Glover Somerset Herald</HI> out of an old Court Roll does attest, confirmed that change his Mother had designed in her life time, and passed away this Mannor to <HI>Roger de Leybourne</HI> for <HI>Stocton</HI> in <HI>Huntington-shire,</HI> and <HI>Rumford</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> and from him did it come down to his great Grandchild <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> sole Heir of <HI>Roger de Leybourne,</HI> whose second Husband <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> was possest of it at his Death, which was in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 59. And after him <HI>Juliana</HI> his Countesse deceasing without Issue, and without Kindred, in the fourty third year of the abovesaid Prince, it escheated to the Crown, and this Monarch desiring to enhance the Revenue of the Church rather then his own, gave it to the Deans and Canons of St. <HI>Stephens</HI> in <HI>West∣minster,</HI> which Donation was confirmed by <HI>Richard</HI> the second, in the twelfth year of his Reign, and afterwards more amply ratified with all the Franchises it was anciently fortified with, in the twenty first year of his Rule, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 1.
<PB N="56" REF="35"/><HI>Memb.</HI> 35. <HI>par</HI> 3. and with it conveyed divers Lands here at <HI>Ashford</HI> and elsewhere, which were formerly relating to the Family of <HI>Leybourne,</HI> but being granted to Sir <HI>Simon de Burleigh,</HI> returned back to the Crown upon his Attaint, which was in the tenth year of the abovesaid Prince, and here in the Revenue of this Cloister did it make a secure abode, untill the rough Hand of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, like that of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> scattered such a Tempest upon these and all other Cloisters, that they shrunk into a common dissolution, and then this Mannor, being in that whirlwind ravished from the Church, and transplanted into the Crown, was by that Monarch granted with <HI>Westure</HI> (which was purchased by Cardinal <HI>Kempe</HI> of <HI>Aldon,</HI> about the twenty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, and setled on the Colledge of <HI>Wie,</HI> and came to the Crown upon its Supression,) to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher</HI> and <HI>Jo. Polsted,</HI> and they not many years after conveyed them by Sale to Sir <HI>Andrew Judde,</HI> who expiring in a Female Heir called <HI>Alice,</HI> she by matching with Sir <HI>Thomas Smith.</HI> annexed them to his Revenue and from him is both <HI>Ashford</HI> and <HI>Westure</HI> come down by descendant Right, to his great Grandchild, <HI>Philip</HI> Viscount <HI>Strangford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Repton</HI> in this Parish was the Seat of that ancient Family of <HI>Valoigns; Waretius de Valoigns</HI> in a Deed whereby on Ash-Wednesday in the the fourty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, releases some Services due to his Mannor of <HI>Swerdlin,</HI> to <HI>Cecilia</HI> Widow of <HI>Richard Greenbold,</HI> writes himself of <HI>Repton. Rualonus de Valoigns</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and dwelt sometimes at <HI>Repton,</HI> and sometimes at <HI>Tremworth.</HI> The last of this Family at this Place was <HI>Waretius de Valoigns,</HI> who concluding in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with Sir <HI>Tho. Fogge,</HI> brought this and much other Land to own the Title of that Family, and they afterwards made this their Seat, which was productive of Persons as eminent for Piety, Prudence and Valour as any that this County, either in Times which have been tempestuous, or else in those which have been calm and serene, hath been fertile, in one of which was Sir <HI>Io. Fogge</HI> Comptroller of the House, and Privie Counsellor to <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, who founded a Colledge here at <HI>Ashford,</HI> consisting of a Pre∣bendarie as the Head, and of certain Priests and Choristers as Members. But to pro∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, after this Seat had so many Generations acknowledged the Interest of this Family, it was in the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated by <HI>George Fogge</HI> to Sir <HI>Michael Sonds,</HI> and he conveyed it to <HI>Iohn Tufton</HI> Esquire, whose great Grand∣child the right Honorable <HI>Iohn Tufton</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> is the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>There was a perpetuall Chauntry here at <HI>Ashford,</HI> in a certain Chappell dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which was founded by <HI>Will. de Sodington,</HI> for which he had a Concession from royall Authoritie, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 17. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. <HI>parte secunda Memb.</HI> 37. The Land which was tied to support it, lay in <HI>Ashford, Willesborough, Charing,</HI> and <HI>Kennington,</HI> which upon the Suppression being dispersed into many Hands, I shall decline any farther labour to trace out.</P>
<P><HI>Ashford</HI> had a Market upon the Saturday, which was allowed by the Judges <HI>Itinerant</HI> to <HI>William de Leybourn,</HI> in the seventh year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, which being thus ratified and confirmed, continueth in force upon that Day, even at this instant.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot <HI>Merdall,</HI> which is the last Mannor in this Parish; It was in∣cluded in the Patrimony of <HI>Corbie,</HI> untill <HI>Robert Corbie</HI> of <HI>Boughton, Malherbe</HI> concluded in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Joan Corbie,</HI> matched to Sir <HI>Nicholas Wotton</HI> twice Lord Maior of <HI>London;</HI> by which Marriage all that vast Demeasne which acknowledged the Interest of that Family, came to be united to this, and continued many years couched in their Inheritance, untill at length, that is almost in our Grandfathers Remembrance, by Sale it devolved to <HI>Sprot,</HI> who not many years since conveyed his Right in it to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> Father to the right honorable <HI>Heneage</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchelsey</HI> now Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Ashurst</HI> or <HI>Ashenhurst</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Watchlingstone,</HI> with the Mannor of <HI>Buckland,</HI> as an Appendage annexed to it, was anciently the Demeasne, as the <HI>Dooms-day.</HI> Text informs us, of <HI>Philip de Gerund,</HI> and <HI>Hugh de Gerund</HI> this mans Successor, was seised both of <HI>Ashurst</HI> and <HI>Buckland;</HI> likewise in the twenty sixth year
<PB N="57" REF="35"/>of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 71. But after this Family determined in a Daughter and Heir, who matching with <HI>Chalfhunt</HI> made that Family possessors of the Fee, and <HI>Henry Chalfhunt,</HI> as we trace by Record, held it in the forty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 14. And after they went out, it came about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, by the Heir General of this Family to be possest by <HI>Hadde,</HI> whose Successor about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, con∣veyed it to <HI>Waller</HI> of <HI>Grome-bridge;</HI> and from this Family, after some Interval of Time, it was carried off by Sale to <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> Lord Treasurer of <HI>England;</HI> and from his Descendant the Title went away not many years since, by the same Fatality, into <HI>Rivers</HI> of <HI>Chafford,</HI> in which Family the Title both of <HI>Ashurst</HI> and <HI>Buckland</HI> are at this instant placed.</P>
<P><HI>Chafford</HI> next invites our Survey, it was for some Descents the Possession of the <HI>Roes</HI> or <HI>Rows</HI> streamed out from that original Fountain, which was of this Name and Family at <HI>Roes Place</HI> in <HI>Alresford;</HI> and from these two those numerous Branches have issued out, which like so many divided Rivulets have dispersed themselves into so many parts of this Nation; but though this Family be here (like a River licked up by a Summer Sun,) shrunk into Oblivion, and the Name wholly dryed, yet hath the Title of this Seat found out another Chanel, for by Sale it now flows in the Name of <HI>Rivers,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Rivers</HI> Baronet, Crandchild to Sir <HI>John Rivers</HI> Knight and Baronet; descended from the ancient Family of <HI>Rivers</HI> of <HI>River Hill</HI> in <HI>Hantshire,</HI> upon the late Decease or his Brother Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> is now Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Aythorne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry</HI> was given to the <HI>Monks</HI> of <HI>Christ Church</HI> by <HI>Ulfred</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the year 824, in exchange for the Mannor of <HI>Berham,</HI> but the principal Honour which did accrue to it, was, that it was parcel of that Estate which claimed the Family of <HI>Badelesmer</HI> for Inheritors, and lay involved in their Demeasn until the infortunate Attainder of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, when being by this Tempest rent off from his Name and Patrimony, it made its abode in the Revenue of the Crown, untill K. <HI>Edw.</HI> the third granted it to Sir <HI>John de Bondon,</HI> who in the eighteenth year of that Prince, conveyed it to <HI>John de Gildesburgh.</HI> After whose <HI>Exit</HI> it came by the same Devolu∣tion to be possest by <HI>Thomas Holben,</HI> who in the twelfth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, passed it away to <HI>Robert Dane;</HI> And now there being an Interval or Gap in the private Evidences, which have an Aspect on this place, I must next represent <HI>Robert Webbe</HI> possessor of it, who in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, transplanted his Interest in it by Sale into <HI>John St. Clere,</HI> and he not long after by the same Fatalitie transmitted it to Sir <HI>Walter Hungerford,</HI> who about the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth setled the Right and Title by Sale on Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> of <HI>Bechworth</HI> Castle in <HI>Surrey,</HI> Comptro∣ler of the House to the abovesaid Prince, who in the twenty seventh of his Reign, as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 27. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>Num.</HI> 37. obtained the Grant of a Fair to be held yearly on St. <HI>Peters</HI> Day, and in this Family the Propriety and Title was fixed until the sixteenth of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed by <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> Esq; to <HI>Francis Santon,</HI> and his Son by the same Vicissitude in the twenty eighth of the abovesaid Princesse alienated it to Sir <HI>William Rither</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> who dying without Issue Male, setled this Mannor on <HI>Susan</HI> one of his Coheirs, first matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Caesar,</HI> and after to Mr. <HI>Thomas Philipott,</HI> second Son to Sir <HI>John Philipott</HI> of <HI>Compton Wascelin</HI> in <HI>Hantshire,</HI> and She upon her Decease gave it to her onely Son by her second Husband Mr. <HI>Villiers Philipott,</HI> who hath lately conveyed it by Sale to Mr. <HI>John Brett</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>

Num.</HI> 50. and lies buryed in <HI>Badelesmer</HI> Church, with his Portraiture crosseleg'd cut in Wood, and so much left of his Name, as discovers to us that it is He who lyes there enterred; and although there hath such a vast In∣terval or Decursion of Time intervened since his Sepulture, yet neither hath Time, nor our modern Zeal, more fierce and ravenous then that, so defaced it but that the Effigies insculped crosseleg'd is yet obvious &amp; visible; and this I believe wil sufficiently refute the opinion of the vulgar, who believe this Figure on the Tomb-stone to be the representa∣tion of some Giant; and this <HI>Guncelin</HI> had Issue, <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> that opulent and powerfull Baron of <HI>Kent,</HI> who was witnesse to the Charter of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, by which he confirms the Franchises and Priviledges of the City of <HI>London,</HI> in the twelfth year of his Reign, and there subscribes himself Steward of the Kings Hostell, and was certainly a very eminent Person, for in the year 1316, when Sir <HI>Richard de Rodney</HI> was invested with Knighthood by the abovesaid Prince, the Ceremony of putting on his Spurs was performed by <HI>Maurice de Berkley,</HI> and <HI>Bartholomew de Bade∣lesmer;</HI> but he had not been long swoln to this vast Dimension of power, but their arose a Tempest which blasted all his blooming Glories, for <HI>Isabel</HI> Wife and Queen to <HI>Edward</HI> the second, having by severall good Offices performed between her Husband, and his disobliged Barons, so becalmed and softned all their Animo∣sities, that they became intombed in a mutuall Pacification, was so inflamed at her denyall of Lodging, and Accomodation in <HI>Leeds</HI> Castle by <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> the Castellan under <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> that she egged and pushed on the King to a Revenge, which was done so effectually, that the Death of the Castellan was the Expiation of so infortunate an Insolence, and the Losse of the Head of the Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> taken Prisoner not long after neer <HI>Pontfrait,</HI> and the forfeiture of his Estate paid the price of his Ambition; and thus this magnificent Baron, who like a streight and procere Elme grew tall in Title, and like its luxuriant Branches, did spread wide in the extent of his Power and Revenue, was by this Storm supplanted, and his Patrimony broken to peices, being gathered up by escheat into the Royall Demeasne; and in this Shipwrack did this Family lye involved, untill the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then the indulgent Munificence of that Prince, boy'd it up out of those Ruines wherein it appeared almost to have been sunk, and by Patent restored him to his Estate here and elsewhere; and he in a thankfull acknowledge to Heaven for this Restitution, according to the Piety of those Times, erected here a House for Black Canons, or Canons of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> as the Record, <HI>pat.</HI> 13. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. <HI>Memb.</HI> 6. doth amply testifie, and dyed in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left his Estate to his only Son <HI>Giles</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmere,</HI> who dying without Issue; his four Sisters, <HI>Mar∣gery</HI> first marryed to <HI>William Rosse</HI> Lord <HI>Hamlake,</HI> and then remarryed to <HI>Tho.

<P>There is another Mannor in this Parish of <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> called <HI>Goddisland,</HI> and gave Seat and Sirname to a Family which formerly had their Mansion at this Place, and <HI>John de Goddisland</HI> is mentioned in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> to have held it in twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and when after some Flux of Time, this Name was ebbed away from this place, the <HI>Atwoods</HI> succeeded, so stiled from their Habitation, nere the
<PB N="60" REF="37"/>Wood, and <HI>Robert Atwood</HI> died seised of it in the sixth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and when this Family began to Decay, the <HI>Sawyers</HI> came in and were Possessors of the place; but long the Fee was not setled in this Name, for the Title about the Be∣ginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh was engraffed by Purchase on <HI>Cheyney,</HI> from which Family by the like Current, it flowed about the Begining of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> into <HI>Snode,</HI> and from them not many years since it was by Sale wafted over to <HI>Franklin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Barham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Kinghamford</HI> gives Name to that spacious Plain, where the <HI>Britons</HI> encountred <HI>Caesar</HI> and his Army at his first Landing at <HI>Deale,</HI> and after a signal Conflict, repelled them back to their Ships. The old Family of <HI>Fitz-Urse,</HI> were formerly Lords of this Mannor, and resolved into the Name of <HI>Berham,</HI> after such Time as one of them called <HI>Randolph Fitz-Urse,</HI> being Ring-leader of three other Cavaliers of the Kings Court, had impiously assassinated Arch-Bishop <HI>Becket.</HI> The Fact being so barbarous in the Estimate of those Times, that flying into <HI>Ire∣land</HI> he abandoned the Name of <HI>Fitz-Urse,</HI> and took that of <HI>Mac-Mahon,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Cam∣den</HI> Notes. Certainly as he was the Actor, and thereby more stained then the rest, so was he much more culpable, beause he held this Mannor of <HI>Berham</HI> of the See of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by the Service of halfe a Knights Fee, so it appears by the Record of the <HI>Aid</HI> kept in the Exchequer, and paid in the twentieth of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third; yet did not this Name vanish at this place, but still was inforced, and multiplied into many De∣scents from whence issued Gentlemen of a prime and eminent Note in this Track, un∣till lately that Fate which Shuffles both Families and Kingdomes into Disorder and Oblivion, hath torn this Mannor now from this Name, and by purchase brought over the Propriety of it to <HI>Fotherby.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shelvingborough</HI> is a second Mannor in this Parish, not to be waved in this Survey, because it was sometimes one of the Seats of <HI>John de Shelving,</HI> who held it in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; But this Family determining not long after in a Daughter and Heir, She by matching with <HI>Haut,</HI> annexed this Mannor to the Patrimony of this Family; and in this Name the Title was carried along by the Clew of many Descents, untill it devolved to Sir <HI>William Haut;</HI> who about the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, concluded in two Female Coheirs, whereof <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> who brought this along with her to that Family, and he about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, devested himself of the possession, and by Sale transmitted his Right in it to <HI>Mantle,</HI> where after the Title had by some small continuance made some little respite, it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>Carlisle;</HI> and here the Propriety, was as transient, for an Alteration of the same resemblance, not many years since, made it the possession of <HI>Hopday.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Diggs Court</HI> in <HI>Barham</HI> was the Mansion of the ancient Family of <HI>Digge</HI> or <HI>Diggs,</HI> which Family about four Hundred years since, that is about the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the first, had the Aldermanry of <HI>Newingate</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as part of their Inheritance, which it seems was not (as now) elective, but as Freehold, either demisable or devisable <HI>ad Libitum</HI> of him or her that held the same: or if neither demised nor devised of him nor her in Life Time, but indisposed of at Death, then as Inheritance or Fee, it descended to the next Heir at Law; These Aldermen every one of them, kept within their own Wards, and happily (as the Jews held theirs) had at their several Gates a Court assembled every three weeks, which was called of our An∣cestors, sometimes the <HI>Hundred Court,</HI> sometimes the <HI>Wardmote,</HI> that is the assembly or the meeting of the Hundred or Ward, or the <HI>Portmote,</HI> as the Jurisdiction was called <HI>Portsoka. John</HI> or <HI>Diggs</HI> was in the year 1258, a great Benefactor to the Fran∣ciscans, who had then newly planted themselves at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and purchased for them an Island in that City called <HI>Binnewight.

<P><HI>Barfreyston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> was anciently held by <HI>Castle-Guard</HI> of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle by <HI>John de Wybarne,</HI> and when this Family had abandoned the possession, which was about the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, it came to be held by <HI>Harward,</HI> and when some years it had been wrapped up in the Interest of this Family, it was transmitted by Sale about the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, to Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> of <HI>Bechworth</HI> Castle; and here the Title lodged, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then part of it was passed away to <HI>Wood,</HI> but the Mannor it self rested in <HI>Brown,</HI> untill the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to Mr. <HI>Thomas Bois</HI> whose successor Mr. <HI>John Bois</HI> not many years since alienated it to Sir <HI>An∣thony Percival</HI> of <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hartanger</HI> and <HI>Soles</HI> are two Mannors situated within the Precincts of this little Parish, who both had owners so Sirnamed.

<PB N="64" REF="39"/>Original, on which they ingraffed their own Name, which hath flourished under that Title ever since, though the Family be withered away and gone, the last of which Name at this place was <HI>Ralph Langley,</HI> who with <HI>Roger Twisden, Stephen Monins, Edward Monins, John Edingham</HI> or <HI>Engham, Richard Edingham, John Berton</HI> of <HI>Cotman∣ton</HI> in <HI>Shouldon, John Berham, John Betenham</HI> of <HI>Shurland</HI> in <HI>Pluckley,</HI> and others, Gentlemen of prime Rank in this County, were summoned to appear before <HI>Robert Poynings</HI> and <HI>John Perry,</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, to disclaim the Title of the House of <HI>York,</HI> and this <HI>Ralph</HI> died in the year 1451, and ordered <HI>Langley</HI> and other demeasns at <HI>Bekenham</HI> to be sold for the discharging his Debts, the purport and Effects of which Will were accordingly performed, and his Estate at <HI>Bekenham</HI> and <HI>Langley,</HI> passed away by Sale to <HI>John Violett,</HI> whose Successors enjoyed it until the Be∣ginning of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, and then it was conveyed to <HI>John Stiles</HI> Esq; who much inlarged the House with a supply of Buildings, and from him is it by Descent de∣volved to be the instant Possession of his Successor Sir <HI>Humphrey Stiles</HI> Knight and Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Kelseys</HI> lies likewise in this Parish, and may justly exact our Notice; by Deeds written in a Character that hath an Aspect upon the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>John de Kelsey, William de Kelsey,</HI> and others of that Sirname are represented to have an In∣terest in this Seat, and from hence it is probable the <HI>Kelseys</HI> of <HI>Surrey</HI> did derive their first Extraction, however by the Injuries of Time they have been in succeeding Generations cast under the umbrage of an obscurer Fortune: But I return, After this Family had deserted the Possession of this place, which was before the latter End of <HI>Richard</HI> the the second, I find the <HI>Brograves</HI> stepped in, and by purchase became Lords of the Fee, a Family which in very old Deeds writ themselves <HI>Burgrave,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Boroughgrave,</HI> though now a more easie Pronunciation hath melted it into <HI>Brograve,</HI> which represents the Etymologie of the Name, to have been in its Origi∣nal perfectly Saxon. In the year 1479, there was a License granted (as appears by the Records of <HI>Rochester</HI>) to <HI>William Brograve</HI> by the then Bishop of that Diocess, to erect an Oratory or Chapple at his Mannor-house of <HI>Kelseys,</HI> the Vestigia or Reliques of which are yet obvious to an inquisitive Eye, and from this <HI>William</HI> did the Title and possession in an even Current come down to Mr. <HI>Thomas Brograve,</HI> who being not many years since deceased, his Widow Mrs. <HI>Martha Brograve</HI> now in respect of Join∣ture, enjoys the present Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Foxgrove</HI> is the last place of Account in this Parish, it had in elder times Pro∣prietaries of this Sirname; for I find <HI>John de Foxgrove</HI> paid respective Aid for it in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family succeeded <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burwash,</HI> and he held it at his Decease, which was in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 44. and from him it descended to his Son <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burwash,</HI> who in the forty third year of the abovesaid Prince, passed it away to Sir <HI>Walter de Paveley,</HI> and in his Family it remained untill the latter End of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Vaux</HI> of the County of <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> and there made its abode untill the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was alienated to <HI>John Grene</HI> Esquire, and he died possest of it in fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; and in this Family did the Title reside, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was demised to <HI>Beversea,</HI> and <HI>Humphrey Beversea,</HI> I find held it in the eighteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and his Descendant passed it away to <HI>Luke Hollingworth,</HI> and he about the Beginning of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, sold his Interest in it to Alderman Sir <HI>Jo. Oliff</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and he dying with∣out Issue Male, <HI>Joan</HI> matched to <HI>John Leigh</HI> of <HI>Addington</HI> Esquire, was his sole Heir, and in Right of this Alliance, did it come down to Sir <HI>Francis Leigh</HI> late of <HI>East-Wickham;</HI> whose Widow Dowager the Lady <HI>Christian Leigh,</HI> is now in Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Bexley,</HI> and in ancient Deeds written <HI>Bekesley,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Rokesley;</HI> and did in Times of elder Inscription belong to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for <HI>Anno</HI> 805. K. <HI>Kenulfus</HI> gave <HI>Bexley</HI> to Arch-Bishop <HI>Vefred ad opus Ecclesiae Christi;</HI> and his Successor to improve his Interest in this Mannor, obtained a Market to be held weekly at this place upon the <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and a Fair upon <HI>Holy-Rood-Day</HI> yearly, in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 9. <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. <HI>Num.</HI> 49. and here the Title
<PB N="65" REF="39"/>it lodged untill it came to the Crown in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by Exchange with <HI>Tho. Cranmer</HI> then Arch-Bishop, as appears by the Records of <HI>Christ Church,</HI> and was passed away by King <HI>Iames</HI> to Sir <HI>Io. Spilman</HI> his Majesties Jeweller, originally extracted out of <HI>Germany,</HI> and he suddenly after conveyed it to that resplendent Luminary of <HI>Englands</HI> Antiquities, Mr. <HI>William Camden Clarenceux</HI> King of Arms, and he upon his Decease gave it to <HI>Brasennose</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> from whom the Lady <HI>Christian Leigh</HI> of <HI>East-Wickham</HI> holds it now as Lessee.</P>
<P><HI>Blinden Court</HI> in old Deeds written <HI>Bladindon,</HI> is the next object of our obser∣vation; It was in elder Times the Possession of <HI>Jordanus de Bladindon</HI> or <HI>Blindon,</HI> who about the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the first passed it away to <HI>Walsingham,</HI> in which Family it was resident untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was carryed over by Sale to <HI>Ferbie</HI> of <HI>Pauls Crey,</HI> and one of this Family about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth transported it by the same Alteration to <HI>William Marshall,</HI> and he not long after conveyed it to <HI>Rawlins;</HI> but it setled longer here, for it remained linked to the Demeasne of this Name almost untill our Grandfathers Remembrance and then it was by Purchase made the Inheritance of <HI>May,</HI> who not many yeers since alienated his Concernment in it to <HI>Wroth,</HI> and is at present, part of the Demeasne of <HI>John Wroth</HI> Esquire, descended from the ancient Family of the <HI>Wroths,</HI> of <HI>Durants</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hall Place</HI> in this Parish is the last place which summons our Remembrance; It was in times of a more ancient Character, the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Athall,</HI> the last of which was <HI>Thomas Athall,</HI> who in the fourty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, conveyed it to <HI>Thomas Shelley</HI> of <HI>Gaysam</HI> in <HI>Westerham;</HI> and in this Name, after the Title like a fixed Inmate had for many Generations dwelt, it came down to <HI>William Shelley</HI> Son of <HI>John Shelley</HI> Esquire, who in the tweny ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth passed it away to Sir <HI>John Champneys</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> from whom it descended to his Grandchild Mr. <HI>Richard Champneys</HI> Esquire, who some few yeers since alienated his Interest here to Mr. <HI>Robert Austin</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brasted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Codsheath</HI> was a Mannor which anciently related to the Family of <HI>Clare,</HI> who were Earls of <HI>Glocester</HI> and <HI>Hertford,</HI> and held is in grand Serjeanty of the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as they were originally, and <HI>de Jure,</HI> Stewards to the Lord Arch-Bishop at the Time of his Installment and Inthronization. <HI>Ric. de Clare</HI> dyed possest of it in the forty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and so did <HI>Gilbert de Clare</HI> in the twenty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 107. From whom it came down to <HI>Richard de Clare,</HI> who in the nineteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, ended in <HI>Margaret</HI> his sole Heir, matched to <HI>Hugh de Audley,</HI> who in her Right was not only Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> but likewise Lord of this Mannor, and enjoyed it in the twenty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; but he likewise going out in a Female Heir stiled <HI>Margaret,</HI> She by matching with <HI>Ralph Stafford</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> wedded the Title to his Inheritance, nor did it dislodge or depart from it until it escheated to the Crown upon the Attainder of <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who was convicted of high Treason in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, where it had not long rested, but the abovesaid Prince by Patent setled the Right of it on Sir <HI>Henry Isley,</HI> who being interessed past recovery, in the Design of Sir <HI>Tho. Wiat,</HI> for∣feited both Life and Estate to the Crown, and then Queen <HI>Mary</HI> upon his Conviction, granted it to <HI>John Lennard</HI> Esquire, from whom it is now transported by Descent to his Successor <HI>Francis Lennard</HI> Lord <HI>Dacres,</HI> who is the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>There is another Mannor and Seat in <HI>Brasted,</HI> venerable enough for its Antiquity, anciently called <HI>Stockets,</HI> but now <HI>Crow-place,</HI> it was so denominated from the <HI>Stockets</HI> which first held it, <HI>Walter de Stocket,</HI> and sometimes in old Deeds written <HI>Stock</HI> and <HI>Stoke,</HI> possest it by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and after this Name began to languish into Decay, it was by a Daughter and Heir brought over to <HI>Crow,</HI> extracted from the <HI>Crows</HI> of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who from the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, held it in a continued Track of Succession, even untill our Time and then it was passed away from Sir <HI>Sackville Crow,</HI> by Sale to Sir <HI>Robert Heath,</HI> who dyed Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> made so by the late King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> whose Son and Heir Mr. ........ <HI>Heath</HI> Esquire is now entituled to the Signorie of it.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="40"/>
<P><HI>Bredge</HI> gives name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and in Times of a more ancient Date, was clasped up within that Revenue, which did augment the pater∣nal Inheritance of <HI>Cheyney,</HI> Sir <HI>Alexander de Cheyney,</HI> (as appears by ancient Muniments, was possest of this place in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and is in the Register of those eminent persons who accompanied that Prince into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was for his important Service against that Nation, made Bannerent by that King at <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his Government, and from him did it by the links of severall Descents, after a large Efflux of Time devolve to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> who about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> passed it away to Mr. <HI>William Partrich</HI> Esquire, whose Grandchild Sir <HI>Edward Partrich</HI> not many yeers since conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Arnold Brame</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> descended from one of this Name who was Secretary to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth.</P>
<P><HI>Blackmanbury</HI> is a noted Seat in this Parish, and had still the same Owners in Times of a more ancient Character, with <HI>Garwinton</HI> in <HI>Bekesbourn,</HI> as namely the <HI>Garwintons,</HI> the last of which was <HI>Tho. Garwinton,</HI> who held it at his Death, which hap∣pened in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and by the Heir Generall of this Family it devolved to <HI>Haut,</HI> issued out from the <HI>Hauts</HI> of <HI>Hautsborne,</HI> and when this Fa∣mily determined, the Female Heir brought this Seat to <HI>Isaac,</HI> after <HI>Isaac</HI> was worn out of a great part of this Mannor of <HI>Blackmanbury,</HI> it became the Possession of <HI>Henry Lawrence</HI> Esquire, descended from the <HI>Lawrences</HI> of <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and he held it, as appears by a Court Roll in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and in both these Families was the joynt Propriety of this Mannor resident untill about the middle of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then the whole Demise was by mutuall Consent passed away from <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence,</HI> to <HI>William Partrich</HI> Esquire, Grandfather to Sir <HI>Edward Partrich,</HI> who not many yeers since conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Arnold Brame</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> and he upon the Foundation of the ancient Fabrick, hath erected that mag∣nificent Pile which obliges the Eye of the passenger, both to Admiration and Delight, and which like a <HI>Phaenix</HI> seems to have arose more glorious out of its Ruines.</P>
<P><HI>Bereacre</HI> is a third Mannor in <HI>Bredge,</HI> which in the twenty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first acknowledged it self to be under the Signorie of <HI>Walter de Kancia,</HI> as appears by an Inquisition taken at the same time after his Death, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 7. But before the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was extinguished, and then it became the Propriety of <HI>Bereacre,</HI> who assumed his Name from this Mannor, and <HI>John de Bereacre</HI> paid a respective Supply for it (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) at making the Black Prince Knight in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After <HI>Bereacre</HI> was gone out, the Family of <HI>Lichfield</HI> was concerned in the Possession, who likewise were Lords of much Land about <HI>Eastry, Tilmanston</HI> and <HI>Betshanger,</HI> and in this Name was the Title placed untill the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then <HI>Roger Lichfield</HI> by Sale conveyed it to <HI>William Haut,</HI> and he had Issue <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> who left only <HI>Margery,</HI> who by matching with <HI>William Isaac,</HI> resigned up this Mannor to the Possession of that Family, but long it was not planted in this Name, for before the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was alienated to <HI>Petit</HI> and <HI>Weeks,</HI> and they again not many yeers after transmitted it by Sale to <HI>Nailor</HI> of <HI>Renvill,</HI> from whom by the same Devolution it was almost in our Fathers Memory carryed down to <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Watkins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Beauville, aliàs Bew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field,</HI> or <HI>Whitfield</HI> lyes in the Hundred of <HI>Bewisborough,</HI> is a small Parish mounted aloft on those Hills that run from <HI>Barham</HI> down to <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, The Lord <HI>Giles Badelesmer</HI> anciently held it, and gave it in Frank Marriage with his Daughter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> whom <HI>Jo. Northwood</HI> of <HI>Milton</HI> took to Wife, and here it con∣tinued with the Interest of this Family severall Descents, untill at last it devolved to <HI>John Northwood</HI> of <HI>Northwood</HI> in <HI>Milton</HI> abovesaid, from which Name and Family the Fate of Sale took it off, and brought it over about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to <HI>Jo.

<P>The Mannor of <HI>Linacre</HI> is seated within the Circuit of this Parish, and gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, and from whom <HI>Linacre</HI> that composed the
<PB N="67" REF="40"/>Latin Grammar in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the ninth, was lineally extracted, but this Name here was expired, before the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then by some Court Rolls I find that <HI>Iohn Monins</HI> was invested in the Fee, and here for some Decursion of Time the Right and Interest of this Place did abide, untill at length about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, the Title by Sale fell under the Signory of <HI>Chelesford</HI> or <HI>Chelford,</HI> from which Name the same Fate conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Io. Bois</HI> whose Successor Mr. <HI>Io. Bois</HI> of <HI>Fredville</HI> Esquire, by descendant Right does now enjoy it.</P>
<P><HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Berming</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Twyford,</HI> was in Times of a very high Ascent the Possession of a Family who derived their Sirname from this Place, <HI>William de Bermeling</HI> dyed seised of it in the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot.

When this Family was gone out, the <HI>Freminghams</HI> came into the Possession, <HI>Iohn</HI> Son of <HI>Ralph de Fremingham</HI> was in the enjoyment of them at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

But after this I find no more of this Name interessed in the Possession the next Family which was invested in the Inheritance were the <HI>Pimpes,</HI> a Name very eminent and no lesse ancient in this Track, <HI>John Pimpe</HI> held them and <HI>Ledhock</HI> at his Decease, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<P><HI>Halls Place</HI> in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so stiled, who in ancient Deeds were written <HI>At-Hall</HI> from their Habitation at some more eminent Mansion, but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third this Family was vanished, and the Signory of this Place surrendered to <HI>Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Preston,</HI> yet some part of it I find by old Deeds was passed away to <HI>Clive,</HI> which <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Bersted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eythorne,</HI> was the Seat of the noble Family of <HI>Crevequer,</HI> before they removed to <HI>Leeds</HI> Castle their Seat and Residence, and in <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book where there is a particular Account taken what Mannors <HI>Hamon de Crevequer</HI> was possest of in the twentieth of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, it is written <HI>Briested,</HI> which could not be meant of <HI>Brasted,</HI> which was the Signory and Possession of <HI>Gilbert de Clare</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the first, as appears by the Records of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where this Earl and his Successors are said to hold the Mannor of <HI>Brasted,</HI> as <HI>Senescalli Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis in sua Inthronizatione,</HI> whereas this Mannor had never any such Tenure united to it, and remained parcell of the Patrimo∣niall Demeasne of <HI>Crevequer,</HI> untill <HI>Hamon de Crevequer</HI> having embarked himself in the Quarrell of <HI>Simon de Montfort</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> made Shipwrack of his Estate here at <HI>Bersted,</HI> which was wrung from him by <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and though he was pardoned by the Pacification of <HI>Killingworth</HI> made in the fiftyeth of that Princes Reign, yet I do not find that he was ever reinvested in <HI>Bersted,</HI> so that it remained in the Crown untill the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and then it was exchanged for other Land with <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> but he having by an ambitious De∣fection forfeited this and much other Land in the fifteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, it lapsed back again by an early Confiscation to the Crown, and lay involved there until the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then being looked upon as wrapped up in the Mannor of <HI>Leeds</HI> Castle as indeed it had been in Appendage unto that, and the Castellans of it, it was granted at that Time to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> from whom it descended to his great Grandchild Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger,</HI> who about the latter end of King <HI>Iames</HI> exchan∣ged it with Sir <HI>Richard Smith</HI> for <HI>Salmeston</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> and two thousand pound in Money to poise the Exchange, and make the Ballance even, and he not long after passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Hollingbourn,</HI> who hath lately enstated it on his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Cheyney Colepeper,</HI> who is entituled to the present Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Milgate</HI> in this Parish was anciently a Mannor, though now by Intermission the Homage is lost and shrunk into Disuse and Oblivion; It was in Ages of a more Antiquity, the possession of a Family called <HI>Coloigne, Robert de Coloigne</HI> was possest of it, and the Record taken after his Decease will inform you that he dyed seised of it in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> third, as appears <HI>Rot.

<PB N="69" REF="41"/>many Generations, even down unto our Times, and was constant to the Interest of that Name, untill the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was passed away to Sir <HI>Thomas Floyd</HI> Receiver to that Princess, and Justice of the Peace for this County, and he much took off from the Obscurity of this Seat, by adding an additional Magnificence, by making the ancient Fabrick swell into the Dimensions not onely of a stately but an elegant Pile, by an augmentation of Building, and from him did it devolve by Descent to his Grandchild Mr. <HI>Thomas Floyd</HI> Esquire, who some few years since transplanted his Right in it by sale into Mr. ...... <HI>Cage.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Mannor in this Parish called <HI>Stone-house,</HI> which formerly lay couched in that Revenue which gave support to the Priory of <HI>Christ Church,</HI> but upon the Resignation of the Demeasn of that Cloister into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was by a new Grant linked to that Patrimony, which was to be subservient to the Interest of the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Christ Church,</HI> which had newly then from the Authority and Munificence of that Prince, received its first Establishment. And certainly from this place, did the <HI>Stone-houses</HI> both of <HI>Kent, Berkshire,</HI> and <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> either as Tenants to the <HI>Monks</HI> of the abovesaid Cloister, or else as having some Mansion, or Habitation of theirs, situated no far distance from this Mannor, anciently extract and spin out the primitive Original of their Name and Family: This is my conjecture, which I leave to more sober and severer Under∣standings either to embrace, or else abandon and discard.</P>
<P><HI>Brabourne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bircholt Franchises,</HI> was a Record drawn out of an old Manuscript, does engage me to affirm the Inheritance in Times of a very ancient Date of a Lady called <HI>Salburga</HI> the Words of the Record that strengthen this Assertion are these; <HI>Provaeda Matrona Nomine Salburga Domina de Brabourne Testamentum con∣stitit, ut qui tenerent Brabourne darent annuatim Sancto Augustino</HI> 40 <HI>Ambras Brasii,</HI> (that is, Plates of Brass) 4 <HI>Boves,</HI> 15 <HI>Arietes,</HI> 20 <HI>Panes,</HI> 1 <HI>Piss.

In Times of a lower Descent, I find <HI>Alexander de Strabolgie</HI> Earl of <HI>Athol,</HI> who flourished here in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first, to have held it, and from him did it devolve to his great Grandchild, <HI>David de Strabolgie</HI> Earl of <HI>Athol,</HI> who held it at his Death, which was in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc.

Esc. Num.</HI> 31. and by a Right derived from her did <HI>John Halsham</HI> possess it at his Decease, which was in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Rot. Esc.

Lewknor,</HI> and <HI>Ioan</HI> his Wife in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth passed it away to Sir <HI>Iohn Scott</HI> Comptroller of the House to K. <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and from this Sir <HI>Iohn Scott</HI> is Mr. <HI>Edward Scott</HI> Esquire, by an uninterrupted Chanell of an Original un∣questioned Descent extracted, who is at this instant, by a Right transplanted unto him from many illustrious Predecessors, entituled to the Possession of this place.</P>
<P><HI>Bircholt</HI> in this Parish, is made more eminent in this Account, because it affords a Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is situated; by Deeds of a very reverend and venerable Aspect, which by the obsolete and antiquated Character seem to have been written in the Time of K. <HI>Iohn</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, it is made the Inheritance ori∣ginally of a Family called <HI>Bircholt; Stephen de Bircholt</HI> possessor of this Mannor paid respective Aid for it (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. But after the Reign
<PB N="70" REF="42"/>of this Prince, I do not find long permanent in this Family, for in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, several old Court Rolls discover to me one <HI>Richard Halk</HI> or <HI>Hawke</HI> of <HI>Westhawks</HI> in <HI>Kingsnoth,</HI> to be planted in the Possession, and an old <HI>Arbor Radicalis</HI> or Tree from whence branches out the several Descents of <HI>Hawk</HI> or <HI>Halke,</HI> and which is now preserved amongst the Evidences of <HI>Bircholt</HI> House; this Family is made to have been Proprietaries of this Mannor ever since the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond, nor is yet departed from the Name, but remains at this instant knit to the rest of the Demeasn of this ancient Family.</P>
<P><HI>Heminge</HI> is the last place of account in <HI>Brabourne,</HI> which anciently yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Appellation; I shall not need to make a Reca∣pitulation from Deeds without Date, of the Antiquity of this Family at this place, it is enough that I shall inform the Reader that after it had been the Possession of this Name (as may be traced out by Evidences) almost three hundred years, it was con∣veyed by <HI>William Heminge</HI> in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth to <HI>Peter Nott,</HI> in which Name the Title is now resident.</P>
<P><HI>Benenden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Cranbrooke</HI> was, as <HI>Doomesday</HI> Book informs me, if not all yet for a principal part of it possest by one <HI>Godricus</HI> or <HI>Godric. In Benenden mansit Godricus</HI> (says the Record) <HI>&amp; tenet XX. Acras in Alodio suo.</HI> What this <HI>Alodium</HI> was, the <HI>Civilians,</HI> and out of them Sir <HI>Henry Spilman</HI> in his Glossarie will inform you. <HI>Alodium est praedium liberum</HI> (saith he) <HI>nulli Servituti obnoxium, quod opponitur Feudo, nam olim Feuda non possent vendi sine consensu Domini. At Alodium vero est. quod per omnem haere∣dum seriem discurrit, &amp; cuivis è populo (etiam reclamante Domino) dare possit aut venundari.</HI> The result of all which is this, that the word <HI>Alodium</HI> signifies a Free Inheritance or Patrimony, not chained up to any particular Service whatsoever, which hath the least Resemblace or symtome of servitude, either by Custome, Prescription, or Law imprinted upon it, and may in <HI>English</HI> be styled Free Soccage, and which being trans∣mitted and conducted along by an uninterrupted Series of Descent from Posterity to Posterity, might be pawned, mortgaged or alienated to any Person whatsoever; whereas on the contrary, Lands which were Feudal could not be passed away without the Lords consent: And this agrees with the Municipal Laws of <HI>France,</HI> which an∣ciently styled those Persons whose Lands were fortified with that Tenure, <HI>Leuds Francs, id est, Nobiles nullius Domini Imperio evocati, Homines sui Juris, &amp; non Feu∣dalis, id est, nullo Feudi Gravamine coerciti vel restricti;</HI> that is, Men of a noble Ex∣traction, free and unrestrained, whose Demeasns were not manacled and tyed up with the Obligations of any Tenure which was Servile, as those whose Lands were Fendal: But enough of this, I shall now return to <HI>Benenden,</HI> which as it gave Seat to the above mentioned <HI>Godricus,</HI> so it seems his Descendants extracted there Sirname from thence, and assumed the Denomination of <HI>Benenden,</HI> and bare for their Armes in a Shield <HI>Azure</HI> a <HI>Lobster Or,</HI> and certainly were of Account in this Track, for <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Roger de Benenden,</HI> held a Knights Fee in <HI>Benenden</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: But as all Families are chained up to a fixed Period, (like the Sea which is it self bound in with a Girdle of Sand) so had this its conclusion likewise, for <HI>Joan Benenden</HI> the Heir General of this Name, by matching with Sir <HI>William Brenchley</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, fastned this Mannor to his Inheritance, and they both lie buried in <HI>Christ Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> He died, as the Date upon their Tomb, for they slumber under one Marble, insorms me, in the year 1446, and She in the year 1453. But after his Decease the Title of this place, did quickly acknowledge another Proprietary, for the Heir General of this Family matched to <HI>More</HI> of <HI>More Court</HI> in <HI>Ivy-Church,</HI> where having been many Genera∣tions, they dislodged from so solitary an Habitation, and planted themselves at <HI>Be∣nenden,</HI> where they erected a House and adopted it into their own Name, by styling it <HI>More Court,</HI> but though it still stand an Alphabet to the Memory of this Family by bearing their Sirname, yet did it not many years after its first Institution and Frame acknowledge the Signory of this Family, for <HI>John More</HI> Esquire, in the first year of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> conveyed it to Mr. <HI>William Watts,</HI> from whom by successive Right it is now come down to Mr. ......... <HI>Watts,</HI> and owns him for its present Proprietary.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Hempsted</HI> in this Parish, anciently, that is, about the twentieth year
<PB N="71" REF="42"/>of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, belonged, as appears by the Book in the Exchequer, called <HI>Testa de Nevil,</HI> to <HI>Robert de Hempsted,</HI> from whence he assumed his Sirname, which could not make the Title long liv'd in his Family; for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find it passed away to <HI>Echingham</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and <HI>James de Echingham</HI> held it by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; but after this the Title was not long constant to the Interest of this Family; for about the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find it in the Hands of Sir <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> the Judge, who being attainted in the tenth year of that Prince, by the Malice and crooked Arts of a factious and insolent Nobility, there was Survey taken of his Estate in the fourteenth year of his Reign, and then this Mannor with the residue of his Estate escheated, being annexed to the Crown, it was by <HI>Richard</HI> the second granted to <HI>William de Guldford</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the eleventh year of that Prince, descended from <HI>Henry de Guldford,</HI> a great Benefactor to the Priory of <HI>Taning,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, and who is mentioned in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> to have held the Mannor of <HI>Wickham</HI> near <HI>Lidde</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> by Knights Service, in the twentyeth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and the abovesaid <HI>William</HI> having thus by the Favour of his Prince obtained this Mannor, made it his Seat, and transmitted it to his Successors, who much improved it with the Supplement of Additional Buildings, so that it hath not only formerly for many Generations continued to be the Seat of this Familie, but is likewise a Mansion relating to this Name at this instant.</P>
<P>Great <HI>Maytham</HI> in <HI>Benenden</HI> was a Mannor which related to the Proprietie of the noble Family of <HI>Malmains,</HI> whose principal Seat was at <HI>Malmains</HI> in <HI>Stoke,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo; Nicholas Malmain</HI> Grandchild of <HI>John Malmain</HI> who likewise held this Mannor in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, paid a proportionate supply for <HI>Maytham</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, and died possest of it in the twenty third year of that Prince: But after this it was not long permanent in this Name, for in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Nicholas Carew</HI> held it at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> that Princes Daughter, and in his Family was the Title constant untill the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was passed away to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell,</HI> afterwards created Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who being convicted of High Treason in the thirty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it escheated to the Crown, and that Prince in the thirty third year of his Rule granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> who the same year conveyed it by Sale to Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> of <HI>Coursehorne,</HI> the Kings Serjeant at Law, and he not long after disposed of it to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgbury</HI> Esquire, who had wedded <HI>Hellen</HI> one of his three Daughters and Coheirs, and he in the last year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth alienated some part of the Land which related to it to <HI>Richard Parker</HI> and <HI>Anthony Franklin,</HI> but the Mannor it self rested in <HI>Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> untill the late King granted it away not many years since to Alderman <HI>Wright</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as being forfeited to the Crowne, because the Lord of it did not pay those Scots and Assessements which were laid upon him towards the Reparation of the Banks of the Mersh; and by <HI>Margaret</HI> the Daughter and Coheir of the abovesaid Alderman, is it now become the Inheritence of Mr. <HI>Richard Cordall</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Lowden</HI> or little <HI>Maytham</HI> is the last Mannor in this Parish, and was wrapped up in that wide Estate which in this County claimed the Family of <HI>Atteleeze</HI> for Proprie∣taries, Sir <HI>Richard Attleeze</HI> held four Knights in <HI>Rolvenden</HI> and <HI>Benenden</HI> in the twen∣tieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, whereof this was parcell, but he dying without Issue in the year 1394, as is manifest by the Date on his Tomb in <HI>Shelwich</HI> Church, <HI>Mar∣cellus Attleeze</HI> his Brother became the Heir to his Estate, but this Mannor was not long after resident in this Name, for in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, which happened about the year 1403, (as appears by the Record kept in the Exchequer, called the Roll of <HI>Blanch</HI>-Lands) it was possest by <HI>Thomas Aucher,</HI> and he paid re∣spective Aid for it at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> that Princes Daughter, and from him did it devolve by Descent to his Grandchild <HI>John Aucher</HI> of <HI>Losenham</HI> Esquire, who concluded in <HI>Ann Aucher</HI> his sole Heir, who was matched to <HI>William Colepeper</HI> second Son of Sir <HI>John Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> and so this Mannor with much other Land came to own the Dominion of that Name, and remained annexed to that Family
<PB N="72" REF="43"/>many Descents, untill not many years since it was by Sir <HI>John Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Losenham</HI> created Lord <HI>Colepeper</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> passed away to his Brother in Law Mr. ...... <HI>More.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bethersden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> contains several places in it considerable, the first that summons our Notice is <HI>Bethersden Lovelace,</HI> which cele∣brates the Memory of a Family called <HI>Grensted,</HI> now vulgarly styled <HI>Grenstreet,</HI> who were its elder Proprietaries, the last of whom was <HI>Henry de Grensted</HI> a man of emi∣nent Repute, as the Records of this County testifie, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but fell under some Umbrage and Obscurity, when he passed away his Estate here to <HI>Kinet,</HI> in whom the Possession was very volatile, for <HI>William Kinet</HI> in the fourty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, conveyed it by Sale to <HI>Jo. Lovelace,</HI> who here erected that Structure that for so many Descents hath born the Name of this Family, and was the Seminary or Seedplot from whence a Race of Gentlemen issued forth, who have in Military Affairs atcheived Reputation and Honour, with a prodigal Losse and Expence both of Blood and Life, and by their deep Judgement in the municipal Laws have deserved well of the Common Wealth, and as by their Extraction they are descended from noble Families, so from hence have sprung those of <HI>Bayford</HI> in <HI>Sedingbourn</HI> and <HI>Kingsdown,</HI> with the right Honorable the Lord <HI>Lovelace</HI> of <HI>Hurley,</HI> and other Gentlemen of that Stem in <HI>Barkeshire;</HI> but alas! this Mansion is now like a Dial when the Sun is gone, that then only is of use to declare that there hath been a Sun, for not many years since Colonel <HI>Richard Lovelace</HI> eldest Son to Sir <HI>William Lovelace</HI> the last of this Name at this Place, passed away his Right in <HI>Bethersden Lovelace</HI> to Mr. <HI>Richard Hulse</HI> descended from the ancient Family of <HI>Hulse</HI> of <HI>Norbury</HI> and <HI>Astly</HI> in <HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Surrenden</HI> the elder House to that of <HI>Pluckley,</HI> for they both had one Ancestor, was the Seat for many Generations of Gentlemen of that Name, in Deeds without Date they are frequently written <HI>Suthrinden,</HI> and continued here untill the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, for in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find by a Fine levyed that year that <HI>Robert Surrenden</HI> sells Lands in <HI>Bethersden</HI> to <HI>John Goldwell,</HI> and this <HI>Robert</HI> had Issue <HI>John,</HI> who passed it away about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth to Cardinal <HI>Kemp,</HI> who setled it in the twenty eighth year of the abovesaid Prince on the Colledge of <HI>Wye,</HI> then newly by him erected, but when that Colledge and all its Demeasne was in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth surrendred into the hands of that Prince, it was by Grant united about the thirty seventh year of his Rule, to to the Patrimony of Sir <HI>Maurice Dennis</HI> Captain of <HI>Calais,</HI> and he in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth alienated it to Sir <HI>Anth. Aucher,</HI> in whom it was resident but untill the fourth year of that Prince, for then it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>Philip Chowte</HI> Esquire, Standard-bearer to King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth at the Seige of <HI>Boloign,</HI> where he wan and at cheived much Honour to himself and Posterity, which was re∣markably testifyed by his Soveraigns Assignation of a Canton of that Standards im∣pression to his ancient Coat, <HI>viz.

<P>In a peculiar Chancel on the Northside, the Parish Church of <HI>Bethersden</HI> belonging to <HI>Lovelace</HI> there was a perpetuall Chauntry founded about the thirty eighth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the sixth, by <HI>Richard Lovelace</HI> Mercer and Merchant Adventurer of <HI>London,</HI> a younger Son of this Family, which was confirmed by the Royall Authority of the abovesaid Prince.</P>

She is styled <HI>Margaret</HI>) entered upon the Inheritance of this place but the Fatality of the other Family did likewise cleave to this, for the Spindle prevailed against the Spear; <HI>Margaret</HI> being Sole Daughter and Heir to this <HI>Hugh Audley,</HI> in whom the Name at, this place met with a sad enterment, and the Estate by her matching with <HI>Ralph Stafford</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> found another Proprietary, and he in her Right held it at his Decease, which was in the forty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and transmitted it to his Son <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> who likewise was in the enjoyment of it at his Death, which happened in the sixteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and from him was the Possession transported along by an unbroken Thread of Descent to <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> a Man magnificent, but infortunate, who being accused of high Treason, attainted and beheaded in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and his Estate here confiscated in the thirteenth, and rested in the Crown untill the abovesaid Prince in the thirty first year of his Reign granted it to <HI>Paul Sidnor,</HI> and he not long after passed it away by Sale to <HI>William Lambert</HI> Esquire, who setled it upon the Colledge of Alms people at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> which is vulgarly called Q. <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Colledg, with a Limitation reserved, that the Heirs male of his Line might hold it in Lease for ever, and in case they might fail, that the last might dispose of it by Testament or Deed to whom he pleased; by virtue of which Reser∣vation, Mr. <HI>John Lambert</HI> of <HI>Sevenoke</HI> Esquire is at this instant Lessee to the Colledge for this Mannor.</P>
<P><HI>Bokinfold</HI> in this Parish is an eminent Mannor which belonged to that Chauntry and Chappel which was founded here by <HI>Hamon de Crevequer</HI> (and confirmed as appears by the first Book of <HI>Compositions,</HI> kept amongst the Records of the Church of <HI>Rochester,</HI>) with the Demeasne appertaining to it, in the forty first year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, and continued being thus forseited and secured by the Royal Charter, untouched, untill the generall Suppression; and being dissolved, the Revenue which anciently supported it, was in the thirty first of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, carried of by Grant to <HI>Paul Sidnor</HI> Esquire, who not long after passed it away to Sir <HI>John Gates,</HI> to whom it was again confirmed in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; but he being infortunately attainted in the fourth year of the abovesaid Prince, as being one of the Partisans of the Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> to whose Service, and for whose Cause he sacrificed his Head, this returned to the Crown, and dwelt in its Revenue untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it away again to <HI>Katharine Tong,</HI> who suddenly after alienated her Interest in it to <HI>Revell,</HI> and he about the latter End of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> passed it away to <HI>Colepeper,</HI> from whom in our Fathers Me∣mory it went away to <HI>Dyke,</HI> and very suddenly from him again to Mr. <HI>Benedict Barnham,</HI> by one of whose four Daughters and Coheirs it came to be the Patrimony of <HI>Soam,</HI> who lately hath demised his whole Concernment in it to Mr. <HI>George Brown</HI> formerly of <HI>Spelmonden</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> now of <HI>Buckland</HI> in <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>There was formerly a Park at this Place, for in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Bartholomew de Badelesmer</HI> held the Mannor and Park of <HI>Bockinfold</HI> in Fee, by
<PB N="74" REF="44"/>grant from that Prince, and the advowson of the Free Chappel of the same; and <HI>Edward</HI> the second in the nineteenth year of his Reign, being on his way to <HI>France,</HI> to do his Homage for the Dutchy of <HI>Apuitain,</HI> suddenly drew back his Foot, and retired to this Place, where he reposed himself, and caused many to be indicted for their unlawfull and irregular hunting in the Park at <HI>Bokinfold,</HI> nor hath Time so dismantled or disparked it, but that yet there are some Memorials or <HI>Vestigias,</HI> remai∣ning which attest the Truth of the Premises.</P>
<P><HI>Criolls Court</HI> is another Manor in <HI>Brenchley,</HI> which by <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter of <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> and Heir Generall of her Brother <HI>John de Crioll</HI> it came to Sir <HI>Richard de Ro∣kesley,</HI> and by his Daughter and Heir <HI>Joan</HI> to <HI>Thomas de Poynings</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>Ed. Poynings</HI> dying in the twelfth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth without Issue or any collateral Alliance, in the fourteenth year of that Prince it escheated to the Crown, afterwards it was granted in the thirty first year of that Prince to <HI>Paul Sidnor</HI> Esquire employed as Agent to that Prince into <HI>Spain</HI> and he not long after alienated it to <HI>William Lambert</HI> Esquire, who setled it upon the Colledge of poor people at <HI>Greenwich</HI> of his Erection, with a Reservation that the Heits male of his Line might hold it in Lease for ever, by virtue of which limitation it is now enjoyed by Mr. <HI>John Lambert</HI> of <HI>Sevenoke</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Parrocks</HI> in this Parish was anciently a Mannor relating to a Family of that Denomi∣nation, which continued Lords of the Fee untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was by Sale conveyed to <HI>William Hextall</HI> Esquire, who dying without Issue male, <HI>Margaret</HI> his sole Daughter and Heir brought this and much Land beside to be the Inheritance of <HI>William Whetenhall</HI> Esquire, from whom the right of Descent wafted it down to his Successor Sir <HI>Richard Whetenhall,</HI> who in the twelfth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> demised it to <HI>William Brooke</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> who not long after passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Nevill</HI> Grandfather to the right honorable <HI>Mildmay</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmerland</HI> now Possessor of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mascals, Capgrove</HI> or <HI>Capgrave,</HI> and <HI>Chekeswell,</HI> are three Mannors in <HI>Brenchley</HI> also, which as the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> informs me, were in the tweneieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the possession of <HI>John de Capgrave,</HI> and it is probable that <HI>John Capgrave</HI> an eminent Monk, an Ornament to Learning, and to the Priory of <HI>Christ Church,</HI> who flourished in the year 1484, and is mentioned with so much Honour by <HI>Pitseus,</HI> was descended from this man, in whose Name these Mannors were not after this long permanent, for as the learned and laborious <HI>Sidrach Petit</HI> does informe me in his Inquest of <HI>Kent,</HI> they fell in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, under the Signory of <HI>Vaux,</HI> whose Successor about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth alienated his Propriety in them to <HI>Humphrey Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> whose infortunate Grandchild <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> being attainted in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, these with the Residue of his Estate escheated to the Crown; from which not many years after, they were passed away to <HI>Edward Ferrers</HI> Esquire, and he conveyed his Right to <HI>Whetonhall,</HI> who about the beginning of King <HI>James</HI> demised them to <HI>Ouldsworth,</HI> who not long after sold them to <HI>Bartue,</HI> and he almost in our Memory transmitted them by Sale to Mr. <HI>Cha. Tucker</HI> Father to the present Owner.</P>
<P>The Rectory of <HI>Brenchley</HI> was given by <HI>Richard de Clare</HI> to the Canons of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> in <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and compounded with the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> with this Provision reserved, that the Rector for the Time being should pay two wax Tapers of four pound Weight to the Priory of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> at the Feast of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen.</HI> The Mannor which was annexed to this Rectory, was upon the Dissolution of this Cloister in the thirty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted to <HI>Paul Sidnor,</HI> and he not long after passed it away to <HI>William Waller</HI> Esquire, from which Family not many years since it was by Purchase invested in the Family of <HI>Courthop.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moatlands</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family who extracted their Sirname from hence, and were called <HI>Brenchley,</HI> a Branch of which was Sir <HI>William Brenchley</HI> Lord Cheif Justice of the Common Pleas, who founded a Chauntry or Chappel in the Navy of the Cathedral at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and dyed in the year 1446 without Issue; nor did these Lands continue much longer in the Name, for in the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth I find them in the Tenure of <HI>More,</HI> who had matched with the Heir Generall, and here the Propriety of this place remained interwoven, with the Inheritance of this Family untill that Age which fell under our Fathers Remembrance, and then it
<PB N="75" REF="44"/>was transplanted by Sale into <HI>Roberts,</HI> the Family with now possesses it.</P>
<P>There are two other Seats in this Parish, which may deserve our notice; the first is <HI>Cats-Place,</HI> which gave Seat to <HI>Hugh de Cat,</HI> and in Recompence took its Denomination from him, and after the Title of it had lodged in this Name many Descents, even until the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, it was passed away to <HI>Tilden,</HI> of <HI>Tildens Place</HI> in <HI>Marden;</HI> and after the Possession had some Ages been united to their Interest, it was some few years since unfastned, and the Propriety of it carried over to <HI>Bassage.</HI></P>
<P>The second is <HI>Vanes,</HI> which yielded both Seat and Sirname to as Illustrious a Family as any in this Track, <HI>Robert Vane</HI> or <HI>Fane</HI> (for they are proimiscuously so written in ancient Rolls) paid respective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and is from him by a continued Series still transported along in the Demeasn of this Name and Family; so that here (if my Light fail me not) should I look for the original of that Noble Name and Family, that since hath so fairly spread into so many several Branches issued primitively from this first original Stem.</P>
<P><HI>Bredgar</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> hath several places in it observable; The first is <HI>Bexon,</HI> from whence the Borough of <HI>Bexon</HI> or <HI>Bexon Street</HI> derives it self; It gave Sirname to a Family in whom in clder Times the Inheritance was planted, and there is yet extant in the Church Windows in coloured Glass a superannuated Portraicture mangled by rude hands, and demolished almost by the Injuries of Time, with this Inscription affixed to the pedestal, <HI>Orate pro Anima Joannes de Bexon,</HI> which disco∣vers to us whose Effigies is represented by it; this <HI>Iohn Bexon</HI> flourished in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, as appears by Deeds, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and had Issue <HI>Iohn Bexon</HI> likewise Rroprietary of this place, after whom I can track no more of the Family at <HI>Bredgar:</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find it invested in <HI>Tong,</HI> who it is probable were extracted originally from <HI>Tong,</HI> not far distant, a Family of good estimate in this County, for I find by some old Deeds, that <HI>Semanus de Tong</HI> who in the sixteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, was Tenant to the <HI>Maison le Dieu in Ospringe,</HI> for Lands at <HI>Lurdinden</HI> in <HI>Challock,</HI> sealed with a <HI>Bend cotised</HI> between six <HI>Martletts,</HI> and sometimes with the <HI>Bend uncotised,</HI> and from him are the <HI>Tongs</HI> who are now Possessors of this place, originally descended.</P>
<P><HI>Swanton Court</HI> was parcel of that Estate which claimed the Lords <HI>Leybourn</HI> for Proprietaries, and from them descended to the Heir General of the Family, <HI>Iuliana de Leybourn,</HI> who dying in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third without Kindred, or without Issue, either by <HI>Hastings</HI> or <HI>Clinton,</HI> this upon a Defailance of both escheated to the Crown, and King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the fiftieth year of his Reign setled it upon the Abby of <HI>Grace</HI> upon <HI>Tower Hill,</HI> in whose Reverue it rested until the Suppression of that Cloister, and then it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth in the thirty sixth year of his Reign granted to <HI>Christopher Sampson,</HI> and he in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth conveyed it to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> and he being attainted in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> it returned by escheat to the Crown, from whence by a new concession it came over to <HI>Reader,</HI> who not many years since conveyed his right in it to <HI>Aldersey,</HI> branched out from the ancient Family of <HI>Aldersey,</HI> of <HI>Aldersey</HI> in <HI>Cheshire:</HI> so that it is now the Inheritance of <HI>Terrey Aldersey</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>The Colledge of <HI>Bredgar</HI> was converted from a Parish Church, first into that we now call a Colledge, by <HI>Robert</HI> then Parson thereof in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, which was establishsd and ratified (saith <HI>Harpsfield</HI>) by <HI>Thomas Arundell</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and in this Capacity or posture it stood until the Dissolution, and then being born away into the royal Revenue, it was by Exchange with the Crown, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, annexed to the revenue for the future of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>There is a place in this Parish called <HI>Mans,</HI> as being in elder Times a Mansion of that Name, as Deeds both of an ancient and modern Date do inform me, which whether it were the ancient Seat of the <HI>Mans,</HI> who have since been transplanted to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> is un∣certain; onely it is very probable, because it had Proprietaries of that Denomination, that this was the Fountain whence this Family issued forth.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="45"/>
<P><HI>Brenset</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Aloesbridge</HI> had still the same Proprietaries with <HI>Newing∣ton Belhouse</HI> near <HI>Hieth,</HI> and therefore is called <HI>Newington Brenset;</HI> and thither for farther satisfaction I shall refer my Reader, only I must inform him, that here is an old Mansion in this Parish, which for several Descents was the Seat of the <HI>Edolphs,</HI> before they were transplanted to <HI>Hinxhill,</HI> and certainly in elder Times were of good Account in this County, and writ their Names in old Deeds <HI>Edulf;</HI> for so is <HI>Stephen Edulf</HI> written in an old Commission, directed to him, <HI>John Peckham</HI> and <HI>Martin Horne,</HI> wherein they were made Collectors for the Cinque Ports in the sixth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; but now this Family hath deserted this Place, having not many years since alienated their Interest here to Mr. <HI>John Fagge</HI> of <HI>Rye,</HI> Father to <HI>John Fagge</HI> of <HI>Wiston</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> Esquire, to whose Revenue it remains now annexed.</P>
<P><HI>Betshanger</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called <HI>Marney</HI> or <HI>Marin</HI> for so the Name is promiscuously written; <HI>Jo. de Marney,</HI> who is in some old Deeds called <HI>Marins,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Mannor of great <HI>Betshanger</HI> the first year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first; but it seems this Franchise did but improve the Sale, and make it more fit to be enjoyed by another, for not long after it was convey∣ed to <HI>John de Soles,</HI> so called from his Habitation near some Ponds, and he died in the enjoyment of it, in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 40. <HI>Parte secunda.</HI> But after this it was not long constant to the Signory of this Family, for about the Be∣ginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find it possest by <HI>Bertram de Tancrey</HI> Lord of <HI>Tancrey</HI> Island in <HI>Fordwich,</HI> and his Descendants enjoyed it until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it went away by Sale to <HI>Rutter;</HI> from which Name about the Be∣ginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, it came to <HI>Lichfield,</HI> whose Arms are yet visibly ob∣vious in ancient Pains of Glass at <HI>Dane Court</HI> in <HI>Tilmanston, viz. Bendee</HI> of six <HI>Pieces Azure</HI> and <HI>Ermin,</HI> and in this Family it continued until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then by the Heir General of this Name it became united to the Pa∣trimony of <HI>Thomas Cox</HI> Esquire, Customer of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. <HI>John Bois,</HI> Ancestor to <HI>John Bois</HI> Esquire, who by Paternal Devolution is now entituled to the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Little Betshanger</HI> was a Seat relating to the Family of <HI>Cliderow,</HI> which in elder Times was of eminent Account in this Track, yet I find that <HI>Iohn de St. Philibert</HI> held Lands here in the thirty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but the Mannor it self was an Appendage to the above mentioned Family;
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He was Knight of the Shire, in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth.</NOTE> <HI>Roger de Cliderow</HI> flourished here in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and as appears by Seals affixed to old Evidences, which commence from the last Kings Reign, bore for his Coat <HI>Armour</HI> upon a <HI>Cheveron</HI> between three <HI>Eagles</HI> five <HI>Annulets,</HI> his Successor <HI>Richard Cliderow</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the fourth and most part of the fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; he was constituted soon after Admiral of the Seas, from the <HI>Thames</HI> mouth along the <HI>Saxon</HI> Shore to the <HI>West;</HI> for in those Times the Admiral∣ty was divided sometimes into three, and most commonly into two Divisions, one beginning at the <HI>Thames</HI> mouth was Admiral of the <HI>Northern</HI> Seas, the second was Admiral from the <HI>Thames</HI> mouth <HI>Westward,</HI> and the third had the command of the <HI>Irish</HI> Seas; but in this man's Time King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in the eighth year of his Reign, reduced it under one Person, and granted it with more ample and wide Authority under his Brother <HI>John Beauford</HI> Earl of <HI>Somerset.</HI> But to proceed after the Title of this place had remained locked up in the Demeasn of <HI>Cliderow,</HI> until the latter end of. <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, it passed away with the Female Inheritrix to <HI>Thomas Stoughton</HI> Esquire, by whom he had three Daughters, who were Coheirs to their Mother, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> matched to <HI>Thomas Wild</HI> Esquire, <HI>Helen</HI> married to <HI>Edward Nethersole,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> wedded to <HI>Henry Paramour,</HI> who by a joynt conveyance passe away their right to their Father in the twentieth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and he in the twenty first year by Deed re-enstates his right in them, and they again by a concurrent and mu∣tual consent alienate their Interest here in the twenty eighth year of her Rule to Mr. <HI>John Gookin,</HI> and he about the first year of King <HI>James</HI> conveyed it to Sir <HI>Henry Lodelow,</HI> who not many years since passed it away to Mr. <HI>Edward Bois</HI> of Great <HI>Betshan∣ger</HI> Father to Mr. <HI>John Bois</HI> Esquire, the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="45"/>
<P><HI>Bicknor</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>Eythorn,</HI> was in elder Times the Habitation of a Family of that Sirname, Sir <HI>John de Bicknor</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas de Bicknor</HI> accompanied King <HI>Edward</HI> the first in his successeful Expedition into <HI>Scotland</HI> and are found Recor∣ded in the Register or Bedroll of those Knights who were made Bannerets at <HI>Carla∣verock</HI> Castle by that Prince, in the twenty eighth year of his Government; but after this, this Mannor stayed not long in the Tenure of this Family; for in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, it came to acknowledge the Dominion of <HI>Roger de Leybourn</HI> Baron of <HI>Leybourn</HI> Castle; from whom it descended to his Sole Daughter and Heir <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> who dying in the forty third year of <HI>Edw rd</HI> the third without Issue and without Kindred, it devolved by Escheat to the Crown, and then that Prince setled it by a new Donation on the Abby of St. <HI>Mary Grace</HI> on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> where it continued until the publick Suppression and then being surrendred up to the Crown, it was in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted to <HI>Christopher Sampson,</HI> and he in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat;</HI> from whom not long after it came by the same conveyance to own the Interest of <HI>Reader,</HI> who about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> alienated his Right in it to <HI>Terry,</HI> who almost in our Memory, partly by Sale, and partly in respect of Alliance, setled the Propriety of it on <HI>Aldersey,</HI> so that Mr. <HI>Farnham Aldersey,</HI> a second Brother of <HI>Terrey Aldersey</HI> of <HI>Swanton Court</HI> Esquire, is now Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Biddenden</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Barkeley, Cranbroke</HI> and <HI>Blackbourn,</HI> had an old Family which took both Seat and Sirname from hence, and when this was consumed and va∣nished, the <HI>Mayneys</HI> were the next who were successively Possessors of it, <HI>John de Mayney</HI> died seised of this and other Lands confining upon it, in the fiftieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and was Son of Sir <HI>John de Mayney</HI> who flourished here, as appears by Deeds, under the worthy Character of Knighthood many years before; and to this Name was the Possession by a continued and unbroken Series of Ages wedded, until some years since the Title was by Sale divorced from this Family, and conveyed by Sir <HI>Anthony Mayney</HI> Knight and Baronet, to Sir <HI>Edw. Henden</HI> Chief Baron of the Exche∣quer; and he by Testament transmitted it to his Nephew Sir <HI>John Henden,</HI> who having lately paid a Debt to Nature which we all owe, his Son and Heir <HI>Edw. Henden</HI> Esquire, does at this instant enjoy it.</P>
<P><HI>Allards</HI> is another ancient Seat in this Parish, which for many Generations past, until of late, acknowledged it self to be the Mansion of that Name and Family, and from hence was <HI>Gervas Alarar</HI> or <HI>Allard</HI> descended, who was Captain and Admiral of the Navy, set forth by the Cinque Ports in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 34. <HI>Edwardi primi,</HI> but now the Distaffe hath prevailed against the Lance; for this Name having been lately wound up in a Daughter and Heir, the Possession of it in her Right is now transplanted into Captain <HI>Terry Aldersey</HI> of <HI>Swanton Court</HI> in <HI>Bredgar</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Castwisell</HI> is a third place in <HI>Biddenden</HI> worth our Consideration, it was in Times very ancient Parcel of that Estate, which did in this County relate to the <HI>Moiles,</HI> extracted from <HI>Moiles Court</HI> at <HI>Bodmin</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and certainly did as high acknow∣ledge the Signory of this Knightly Family, as any Land they held in this County, for though by some old Deeds not bounded with any date, I find the Name of <HI>John de Castwisell</HI> affixed as <HI>Teste,</HI> yet by those old Deeds and Muniments, which have an Aspect upon this Mannor, I discover that <HI>Walter Moile</HI> Knight in the sixth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third did grant to <HI>Reginald</HI> and <HI>William Sand:</HI> all those Lands, Tenements, Rents and Services which <HI>Simon Gidinden ad Formam</HI> late held of the said Sit <HI>Walter,</HI> as of his Mannor of <HI>Castwisell,</HI> and by a subsequent Deed dated in the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find that <HI>Margaret</HI> Widow of <HI>William Scapis</HI> of <HI>Burmersh,</HI> did grant to <HI>Walter Moile</HI> which was the Judge, all that Messuage and Land she held in <HI>Biddenden,</HI> and by a Deed of a more modern Inscription, that is one which comences from the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, I find that <HI>Thomas Moile</HI> of <HI>Eastwell</HI> Gentleman, afterwards dignified with the order of Knighthood by the abovesaid Prince, conveyed it to <HI>Stephen Rogers</HI> Gentleman, and from him is Mr. <HI>Jonathan Rogers,</HI> now possessor of this place, originally descended.</P>

<P><HI>Bidborough</HI> is the last place which shuts up the <HI>Lowy</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> here were Lands which were the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Chauney,</HI> the first of whom with whom I meet with in Record is <HI>Thomas le Chauney,</HI> who paid respective Aid for it at making the Black Prince Knight (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) in the twen∣tieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and continued in his Family divers years after his <HI>Exit;</HI> for in the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find <HI>George Chauney</HI> possest of it; but after him I can trace out no more of this Family who held it; the next who succeeded in the Possession were the <HI>Palmers,</HI> as is manifest by some old Court Rolls, which represent one <HI>Thomas Palmer</HI> to have been Lord of the Fee in the Reign of <HI>Ed.</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, but made no long stay in this Name; for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was alienated to <HI>John Vane</HI> Esquire, and the de∣scendant of this Family Sir <HI>Ralph Vane</HI> being attainted in the fourth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the sixth, it escheated to the Crown, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the first year of her Rule granted it to <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Ramhurst</HI> is another little Mannor in <HI>Bidborough,</HI> which the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> informs me in the twentieth year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, to have been possest by a Family called <HI>Warehall,</HI> and remained in their possession until the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was passed away to <HI>Colepeper,</HI> whose Ancestor <HI>John Colepeper</HI> died seised of some Estate here in the forty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<P>There is an House in this Parish called <HI>Bounds,</HI> and in ancient Deeds called <HI>Bunds,</HI> which, as Tradition avers, was the utmost Margin or Limit which bounded that League of Earth which hath been since known by the Name of the <HI>Lowy</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and was given by <HI>Will.

<P>The Mannor of <HI>Bidborough</HI> it self had the same owners with that of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> as name∣ly, the Earls of <HI>Clare, Audley,</HI> and <HI>Stafford,</HI> and escheating by forfeiture to the Crown, upon the attaint of <HI>Edw. Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, it was by Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted in the first year of her Reign to <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> whose Son <HI>George Cary</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon</HI> dying without Issue Male his onely Inheritrix <HI>Elizabeth</HI> wedded to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Barkley</HI> linked it to his Patrimony, and he in the Be∣ginning of King <HI>James</HI> conveyed it to Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> Grand-father to <HI>Robert Smith</HI> Esquire, who lately died possest of it.</P>
<P><HI>Bilsington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>New-church,</HI> was folded up anciently in that Patrimony which acknowledged the Dominion of <HI>John Mansel,</HI> a man of eminent Note in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears by that Chain of offices which adorned his Greatness; for he was Constable of <HI>Dover</HI>-Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Provost of <HI>Beverley,</HI> for the abovesaid Prince, and Queen <HI>Eleanor</HI> his Wife, and Treasurer of the Church of <HI>York;</HI> but he not long enjoyed it, for he in the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, made God his Heir, and devested himself of the propriety of it, to settle it on the Priory of <HI>Bilsington,</HI> which was of his Foundation and Endowment, and by dedication entituled to the Patronage of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and was furnished with white Canons, or Canons <HI>Pramonstratenses;</HI> and in this condition did it remain, until not onely this, but all other Orders in this Nation, having warped and revolted from their original Integrity, and those closer Engage∣ments and narrower Restraints, the Rules of their primitive Institution tyed them up in, a dissolution of Mannors called for a Dissolution of Demeasn; but now, whether those who did so zealously pretend to correct their Lives, did not more seriously intend to reform the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, and arraign them, not according to the Guilt of their Crimes, but the Hainousness of their Estates, will fall under a sober Consideration; that the Excesses of the Romish Clergie were high, their Imper∣fections many, and their Irregularities clamorous, is without controversie; now what the Causes were which unfastned the Ligatures of streighter Discipline, which like
<PB N="79" REF="46"/>so many Nerves did both move and tie together all the Limbs of the Body Ecclesia∣stick, I shall now briefly discover: The first Cause of this Depravation was the removing and abating those Persecutions which had so long with a sad and bloody pressure grated upon Christianity, under the Scepter of ten Heathen Tirants; and we know that the Fable tepresents to us, that when the Laurell, the Guerdon, and Salary of Triumphs, and the Sweat of the Laborious shoulder, withered and shrunk into Decay, the Figge∣ttee sprang up our of its Ruines, which is the Emblematick Type of Softness and Effeminacy; and we read that the Lamps of <HI>Tullia</HI> and <HI>Terentia</HI> burnt with a clear and uninterrupted Flame, as long as they were Recluse to the Cloisters of their Urnes and Vaults, and dwelt in the Scene and Comprehension of Darkeness; but when they were brought out into the Publick, like Camphire, they evaporated into the Air that fed them: So the Primitive Christians who shone with such a bright and constant Beam in the Night and Agony of their Affliction, when they were melted with the warmth and Sun-shine or a calme and prosperous Fortune, began to slacken into Luxury and Excess, Folly and Disorder; and they that had dared Axes and Racks, Wheels and Gridirons, the Teeth of Beasts and the Fury of Men, the Heat of Persecution and the Flame of Oblation; and in brief, had been inexpugnable to all the Artifices and Engines of Torture, contrived by impious men, fell afterwards cheaply and tamely, like those who are smothered with Roses, stifled with Perfumes, and strangled with a silken Halter. The second Cause, that elder observations insi∣nuate to us, to have been the Reason of the Clergies deviation, is, that vast heap of temporal Treasure with which <HI>Constantine</HI> loaded the Bosome of the Church; so that it may be truly affirmed, <HI>Religio peperit Divitias, &amp; Filia devoravit Matrem;</HI> for Poverty, though like a streight and narrow Girdle it does with its close and uneasie stricture pinch and afflict us, yet it keeps the Garment from falling into Loosness and Disorder; whilst superfluity of Wealth is apt to untie those Restraints which are cast upon the Will, and unshackle those Fetters which are laid upon the sensual Appetite, rendring our Thoughts vain and trifling, foolish and impertinent, and our under∣takings wild and irregular, making us soft and easie for the impressions of Vice; but difficult and uncapable of the influences of Vertue, and the nobler Designs of Religi∣on: For it is farther observable, that from Riches evaporate the Fumes of Luxury and Ambition, which like those Mists which exhale from the Crudities of a raw Stomach, debauch the understanding, and disorder Reason, and muffle them up in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vaile and in a Cloud; and they that view the Light of Truth, which is the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lu∣minary in the Firmament of the Church, through the Vapours of secular Interest, are like those who take the Prospect of a Star, through a gross vaporous Body of Air: they behold it by the Chanel of so polluted a <HI>Medium,</HI> they view it in an uneven and incertain <HI>Paralax.</HI> The third Cause of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efection of Ecclesiastical Persons in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from the severer Obligations of their original Institution, is this; the Pope had newly entituled himself to a vast and uncircumscribed Power, and found that there was an Obligation imposed upon him to support the Clergy in all their Excesses and vitious Sallies, that so they might be obliged to engage the Pulpit and the Pen, in the asserting of that Authority which the Western Emperors vainly endevoured by frequent Contests and Struglings to wring out of his Hands, and rein∣vest in themselves; and they looking up, and discovering that he beheld their Disorders with a calm and an indulgent Brow, let loose the Golden Reigns of Discipline; and it is no wonder if at any Time the Bridle of Government be slackned, when the Snaffle that should keep it steady and even, hath lost its two Bosses, Fear and Punishment.</P>
<P>But I have digressed, I now return; After the Suppression had entituled the Crown to this Maunor, which formerly supported the <HI>Convent</HI> of <HI>Bilsington,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth in the thirty seventh year of his Reign by Royall Concession made it the Inhe∣ritance of Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Ulcombe,</HI> in which Family the Title was permanent, untill the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then his Son Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger</HI> passed it away to Sir <HI>Francis Barnham</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Knight,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Walter de Bern∣ham <HI>was one of those who was at the seige of</HI> Carlaveock <HI>in</HI> Scotland <HI>with</HI> Edward <HI>the first in the twenty eighth of his Reign, Knights and bore the Paternall Coat of this Family,</HI> viz. <HI>Sables, A plain Cross engrailed between sour Crescents Argent.</HI></NOTE> whose great Grand-childe Master <HI>Robert Barnham</HI> Esquire, by Paternal devolution and descent, does now claim the instant Signory of it.</P>

<P>Neither <HI>Bilsington</HI> in this Parish is that Mannor, which anciently was held by a Fa∣mily called <HI>Staplegate</HI> of <HI>Staplegate</HI> in <HI>Natindon,</HI> who claimed to be the Kings chie Butler at his Coronation. The first that I find possest of it was <HI>Edmund de Staplegate</HI> to whom it was derived by Purchase, about the middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; from <HI>Richard Fitz Allan</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell,</HI> whose Ancestors held it many years before, and he having thus entered upon it by his Acquist, dyed possest of it in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 58, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>Edmund de Staplegate,</HI> and he in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second put in his claim to be chief Butler at his Coronation, as holding this Mannor by the Tenure of grand Serjeantry to discharge that Office; to evacuate his claim, <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell</HI> exhibits a Petition and Plea, wherein he asserts that the Office of chief Butler was never annex∣ed to this Mannor of <HI>Bilsington,</HI> that his Family had enjoyed it both before the Possession and after the Alienation of it, and therefore desired he might perform it that Solemn Day; upon the discussion of the whole Controversie, it was ordered, that that Day the Earl of <HI>Arundell</HI> should discharge it with a <HI>salvo jure,</HI> that it should not infringe the Right of <HI>Staplegate</HI> or any other that should pretend a Right or Title to it for the future. But to proceed, this Family held this Manor untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then the Fate of Sale carryed it away to <HI>Cheney,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Cheney</HI> Knight was seized of it at his Death, which was in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and from him was it wafted down by the Thread of Descent to his Successor <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheney,</HI> who about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> alienated his Propriety in it to Sir <HI>Francis Barnham</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Knight, from whom by Successive Right the Title is now devolved to his great Grand-childe, Master <HI>Robert Barnham</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Birling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkfield,</HI> was belonging, when the great Survey of <HI>England</HI> was taken, called <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book, to one <HI>Ralph de Curva Spina,</HI> and tha anci∣ent Seat of those who were the possessors of it was at <HI>Comport</HI> or <HI>Comford</HI> Parke in this Parish; but before the End of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, the above mentioned Family was worn out, and then I find a Family called <HI>Crescie</HI> to succeed in the Inheritance, <HI>William de Crescie</HI> had a grant of Liberties in <HI>Birling</HI> in the fifth year of King <HI>John,</HI> but his Name and Family after this did not long continue to possess them, for before the Expiration of the long and tempestuous Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, it was depar∣ted from them, and planted in th Revenue which did call that Family of <HI>Say</HI> Propri∣etaries; the first of whom was <HI>William de Say,</HI> who was one of those who stuck so close to the Cause and Quarrel of <HI>Simon de Montfort</HI> the active Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> after whose Ruine at the Battle of <HI>Evesham,</HI> and the total Discomfiture and Dissipation of of his Forces in that signal Conflict, he was found in the Register of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen who were pardoned by the pacification at <HI>Kenelworth,</HI> and died possest of it in the twenty third year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 48. and in some old Deeds it is called <HI>Caput Baroniae de Say;</HI> now the vulgar opinion was formerly that that thirteen Knights Fees and a half made up a Tenure <HI>per Baroniam</HI> now how much in value a Knights Fee was, was the Question in elder Times, some affirming it to be 50 l. others 30 l. and diverse again but 25 l. but the common received opinion is which hath been generally allowed of by all our Law Books, that it is in Estimate but 20 l. consisting of eight Carucates or Hides of Land for they are coincident allowing to every Carucate or Ploughed Land an 100. Acres, which was anciently thought to be as much as one team of Oxen could plough up in a year; but the Tenure it self which was compounded of these Knights Fees was altogether incertain, for unless it be that Manscript stiled <HI>Modus Tenendi Parliamentum,</HI> which is of no higher Age then the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, there is no Record does state or fix it, <HI>Walter de Meduana</HI> or <HI>Mayney</HI> Ancestor to the <HI>Mayneys</HI> of <HI>Linton</HI> held twenty Knights Fees as appears by the <HI>Red</HI> Book kept in the Exchequer, <HI>Folio</HI> 84, yet was not under the Repute of a Baron, <HI>Walter de Wahull</HI> had the possession of 30. Knights Fees, and <HI>John de Port</HI> of 50. yet neither of them out of so vast a Tenure could multiply or inforce to themselves the Stile or Title of Baron, whereas on the contrary <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> who marryed the Coheir of <HI>Vipont,</HI> and was really a Baron, makes a recognisance of his Service, as appears by <HI>Kirkbies</HI> Inquest kept in the Exchequer, and taken in the ninth
<PB N="81" REF="47"/>year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, but for two Knights Fees and an half; from all which reci∣ted passages is evinced that this Title of Baronage flowed only from the Favour and Indulgence of the Prince, who by his Writ or Summons called those who had meri∣ted well by some worthy undertakings to this Dignity and Title, and not from the vastness of their Patrimony, though this did very much concurre afterwards to sup∣port their Baronage in its true Value and Lustre. But to proceed, <HI>Jeffrey de Say</HI> this Mans Successor had view of Franck Pledge here in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, that is, as appears by the Statute of Frank Pledge made in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, he was to take Cognisance of those Disorders and Excesses in his Court Baron that were committed by those which held in Free-Soccage of his Mannor of <HI>Berling,</HI> as well as of those which held in Knights Service or Villen age; and this <HI>Jeffrey</HI> in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third dyed possest of this place, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 37. and left it to his Son <HI>William de Say,</HI> who likewise was in the Tenure of it at his Death, which happened in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 43. <HI>Parte secunda,</HI> and transmitted it to his Son <HI>John de Say,</HI> who likewise held it at his Decease, which was in the sixth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 67. and from him did it devolve by descent to his Son and Heir <HI>Jeffrey</HI> Lord <HI>Say,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second alienated his Inte∣rest here by Sale to <HI>Richard Fitzallan</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell,</HI> Lord Treasurer and Lord high Admirall of <HI>England;</HI> from whom it came over to his Son <HI>Thomas Fitzallan</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell,</HI> and Lord Treasurer of <HI>England</HI> likewise, who dying in the year 1416. without Issue, <HI>Joan</HI> one of his Sisters matched to <HI>William Beauchampe,</HI> summoned to Parliament, as Baron of <HI>Aburgavenny,</HI> in the sixteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, became his Coheir, and so he by this Alliance was acknowledged for Lord of the Fee, but his Son <HI>Richard Beauchampe</HI> created Earl of <HI>Worcester</HI> in the year 1420, dying without Issue male in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his sole Daughter and Heir by matching with <HI>Edward Nevill,</HI> who in her Right became Baron of <HI>Aburgavenny,</HI> annexed <HI>Birling</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> Parke to his Revenue, and he dyed possest of it in the sixteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and from him did it descend to his great Grandchild <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Aburgavenny,</HI> who in the twenty ninth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> dying without Issue male, gave it to his Kinsman Sir <HI>Edward Nevill</HI> afterwards Baron of <HI>Aburgavenny,</HI> whose Grandchild <HI>John Nevill</HI> Lord <HI>Aburgavenny</HI> possesses now the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Bobbing</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton</HI> was the ancient Seat of the illustrious Family of <HI>Savage, Roger de Savage</HI> obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Lands at <HI>Bobbing Milsted,</HI> and elsewhere in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, his Father Sir <HI>John de Savage,</HI> was engaged with <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at the remarkable Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his Reign, and there for his Signal Service, was with <HI>Thomas Savage</HI> his Brother created Knight Banneret; Sir <HI>Arnold Savage</HI> this mans Grandchild was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the fourth and ninth years of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and was afterwards Speaker of the Parliament, in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, as appeats by the late printed Abridgement of the Parliament Rolls preserved in the <HI>Tower,</HI> and was one of the Privie Counsell to that Prince, as appears by the private Evidences of this Family, his Daughter <HI>Eleanor</HI> was first matched to Sir <HI>Reginald Cobham,</HI> by whom she had no Issue, and after was remarried to <HI>William Clifford</HI> Esquire, Son of Sir <HI>Lewis Clifford</HI> Knight of the Garter, descended from <HI>Clifford</HI> of <HI>Cliffords</HI> Castle in <HI>Herefordshire;</HI> who upon the Decease of his Wifes only Brother, this Sir <HI>Arnold Savage</HI> without Issue in her Right, as Heir Generall entered upon his Estate here at <HI>Bobbing,</HI> and was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and again in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, his Kinsman <HI>Robert Clifford</HI> Esquire, Brother to <HI>Richard Clifford,</HI> first Arch-Deacon of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> secondly Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and thirdly Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> was Knight of the Shire for <HI>Kent,</HI> in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and lyes buryed in the middle Isle in the Body of <HI>Christ Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> though now his Portraicture in Copper with the Inscription affixed, with the many Coats declaring his Descent and Alliance, are torn off and defaced; the above mentioned <HI>William</HI> had Issue, <HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>John, Lewis</HI> had Issue <HI>Alexander Clifford</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the fifth year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the
<PB N="82" REF="48"/>fourth, and he had Issue <HI>Lewis Clifford</HI> Esq;, who was likewise Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the thir∣teenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and from this <HI>Lewis</HI> was <HI>Henry Clifford</HI> lineally descended who almost in our Fathers Remembrance passed away his Interest here to Sir <HI>Coniers Clifford,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife Widow of <HI>Southwell,</HI> whom he had made joynt purchaser with him in the Conveyance, after whose Decease she was remarried to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by whom she had Issue Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger</HI> now of <HI>Wierton</HI> House in <HI>Boughton Montchentsey,</HI> who by a Right derived from a Donation of his Mother divided the Mannor of <HI>Bobbing</HI> with his two half Brothers <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Coniers Clifford,</HI> all whom not many years since by mutuall and joynt Consent alienated the whole demise to Sir <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Cosington,</HI> and he not long after passed away his Right in it by.

<P><HI>Borden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton</HI> hath nothing memorable in it but the Mannor of <HI>Criolls</HI> and <HI>Poyles,</HI> for they were alwaies united together, and were parcell of that spreading Demeasne which fell under the Signory of <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> and he dyed possest of them in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left it to <HI>John Crioll</HI> his Son and Heir, who dying without Issue, <HI>Joan</HI> his Sister and Heir Generall brought this and much other Land to be possest by her Husband Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley;</HI> but he likewise deceasing without Issue, the same fatal Vicissitude brought it by <HI>Joan</HI> sole Daughter and Heir to be the Patrimony of <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> in which Family the Title flowed with an uninterrupted Current untill it devolved to Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> who dyed in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, without Issue lawfully begotten, and as it appears by the last Inquisition taken after his Decease in the fourteenth year of that Prince, without any respective Kindred that could legally entitle themselves to his Estate, so this Mannor escheated to the Crown, and was granted by the abovesaid Prince to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> who lost it again upon his attain∣der in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> but was restored again by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the twenty fifth year of her Reign to his Son <HI>George Wiat</HI> Esquire only for life, for the Reversion thereof was by King <HI>James,</HI> by his Letters Patents bearing Date the fifteenth Day of <HI>June</HI> in the sixteenth year of his Reign, granted to <HI>Thomas Hooker</HI> and <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Sutton Barne</HI> is a little Mannor in this Parish remarkable only in this, that <HI>Roger de Savage</HI> Son of Sir <HI>John Savage,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free Warren to it in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; and continued with the Name untill the Heir Generall carried it away with <HI>Bobbing</HI> to <HI>Clifford,</HI> in which Family it remained untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was passed away to <HI>Platt,</HI> Ancestor to Mr....... <HI>Plat</HI> of <HI>Borden,</HI> who now enjoys the Inheritance of it.</P>
<P><HI>Bonnington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Street</HI> did anciently appertain to the Knights <HI>Templars,</HI> and being found in the Register of their Demeasne at their total Sup∣pression, which was in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, it was in the seventeenth year of that Princes Rule by a new Provision made by Act of Parliament, setled on the Knights Hospitallers, or of St. <HI>Johns</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and so lay enwrapped in their Patrimony which was wide and spacious in this Track, untill the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then by the Suppression of this Order it was made parcell of the Royall Revenue, untill the abovesaid Prince in the thirty fifth year of his Govern∣ment granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> and he not long after conveyed it by Sale to Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> of the Dungeon neer <HI>Canterbury,</HI> from whom it devolved by successive Right to his Successor Sir <HI>James Hales,</HI> who almost in our Memory alienated his Interest in it to Sir <HI>William Man</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Singleton</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Bonington,</HI> which was the Inheritance of a Family which anciently extracted its Sirname from the abovesaid Parish, and was called <HI>Bo∣nington,</HI> of which Family was <HI>Ni. de Bonington</HI> who paid respective Aid for this Mannor at
<PB N="83" REF="48"/>making the Black Prince Knight; after this Family was extinguished, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, the <HI>Breslands,</HI> a Family who were Owners of a plentifull Estate in <HI>East Kent,</HI> were entituled by Purchase to the Possession of this Mannor, and continued in the Tenure of it untill about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it passed away (as appears by some ancient Court Rolls to <HI>Cobbe,</HI> whose Arms, <HI>viz.

<P><HI>Brookland</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Aloesbridge,</HI> anciently was wrapt up in the Patrimony of a noble Family called <HI>Passeley,</HI> whose Seat was at <HI>Thevegate</HI> in <HI>Smeth, Edmund de Passeley</HI> is the first whom in publick Record I discover to have been possest of it, as appears by an Inquisition taken after his Decease in the nineteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Brook</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> was given to the Priory of <HI>Christ Church</HI> by <HI>Charlemanus</HI> a Priest, which Donation was first ratified by the Charter of <HI>Henry</HI> the first, and secondly confirmed by that of <HI>Henry</HI> the second: In the Conque∣rours time you will find it thus represented, <HI>Rodbertus de Romeney tenet</HI> 1 <HI>Manerium de Brock, ad firmam de Cibo Monachorum, &amp; pro</HI> 1 <HI>Sulling defendebat se, &amp; nunc pro Dimidio, &amp; valet</HI> 4 l. This upon the Surrender of the abovesaid Cloister, and its Revenue into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was enstated on the newly erected Dean and Chapter of <HI>Christ Church,</HI> and there was lodged untill this Age of Discomposure and Distraction, and now it is rent off.</P>
<P><HI>Bromley</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred where it is situated, and hath been many Ages part of the Demeasne of the Church, since it was given (as appears by the Records of the Church of <HI>Rochester</HI>) by <HI>John Later</HI> a Goldsmith of <HI>London</HI> to the Bishop of that Sea in the year of our Lord 1300.</P>
<P>There are two Seats within this Parish which were alwaies of temporall Interest, and pretend to a deep Antiquity; The first is <HI>Sundridge,</HI> which formerly was the Patrimony of a noble Family called <HI>Blund, Peter le Blund</HI> was Constable of the Tower of <HI>London</HI> the thirty fourth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Ralph le Blund</HI> his Grandchild paid respective Aid for his Lands at <HI>Bromley,</HI> which he there held by a whole Knights Fee of the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and when this Name was entombed in a Female Heir, this Seat went with
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>her to the <HI>Willoughbies,</HI> from whom the Earl of <HI>Lindsey</HI> is descended; and when some years it had rested in this Family, by the Circumstance of Purchase, it became the Patrimony of <HI>Booth;</HI> when this Name was likewise wound up in an Heir Generall, the <HI>Betenhams</HI> of <HI>Pluckley</HI> by matching with her, became Lords of this Manfion, and and continue still Proprietaries of it.</P>
<P><HI>Simpsons</HI> is the second Seat of Account, though in Ages of a later Inscription it contracted that Name, yet anciently it was the Demeasne of <HI>Bankewell,</HI> a Family of Signall Repute in this Track, <HI>John de Bankewell</HI> had a Charter of Free Warren to his Lands in <HI>Bromley,</HI> in which this was involved in the thirty first of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and <HI>Thomas de Bankewell</HI> dyed seised of it in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and when this Family was shrunk at this Place into a finall extinction; the next who were eminent in the Possession of it, were the <HI>Clarks,</HI> and one <HI>William Clark</HI> that flourished here in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, that he might not be obnoxious to the Statute of Kernellation, obtained Licence to erect a strong little Pile of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime and Stone, with an embattell'd Wall encircled with a deep Moat, which is supplyed and nourished with a living Spring; but this mans posterity did not long enjoy it, for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>John Simpson</HI> dwelt here by right of Purchase, and he having much improved the ancient Fabrick, setled his Name upon it, and indeed that is all that's left to Evidence they were once Owners of it, for in an Age or two after this, it was conveyed to Mr. <HI>John Stiles</HI> of <HI>Bekenham</HI> Esquire, from whom descends Sir <HI>Humphrey Stiles</HI> Knight and Baronet, Cupbearer to the late K. <HI>Charles,</HI> and him does <HI>Simpsons</HI> confesse for its instant Owner.</P>
<P>There is a Well in the Bishops Park, called St. <HI>Blases</HI> Well, which anciently had an Oratory annexed to it, dedicated to St. <HI>Blasius,</HI> which was much frequented at <HI>Whitsontide,</HI> because <HI>Lucas</HI> who was Legat for <HI>Sixtus</HI> the fourth here in <HI>England,</HI> granted an indulgent remission of forty Days injoyned Pennance, to all those who should visit this Chappell, and offer up their Orizons there, in the three Holy-days at <HI>Pentecost</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boughton Montchensey</HI> is placed in the Hundred of <HI>Twyford,</HI> and hath that Addition annexed to it, to signifie to us that it was once the Possession of the Family of <HI>Montchen∣sey</HI> whose principall Seat was at <HI>Swanscamp,</HI> where I shall treat more largely of them, but though originally they held this Place, yet it was not long a Branch of their Demeasne, for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, they had deserted the Possession, and surrendred it up to <HI>Hougham</HI> of <HI>Hougham</HI> by <HI>Dover,</HI> and <HI>Robert de Hougham</HI> dyed possest of it in the forty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and had Issue <HI>Robert de Hougham,</HI> after whose Death the Spindle prevailed against the Spear, for he concluding in Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Bennet</HI> one of them was matched to <HI>John de Shelving,</HI> and he by a Right derived from her, was invested in the Possession, and dyed seised of it in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and so did his Widow in the twenty second year of that Prince, and with them the Name of <HI>Shelving</HI> expired in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Helen,</HI> who was affianced to <HI>John de Bourn,</HI> and so he in her Right became entituled to the Signory of this Mannor; but before the end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, this Family found likewise its Tomb in a Female Inheritrix, who was married to <HI>Haut</HI> of <HI>Hauts Place</HI> in <HI>Petham,</HI> and <HI>Edward Haut</HI> held this Mannor in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, as appears by the Pipe Roll relating to that Time; but after this it was not long united to their Inheritance, for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, by an old Court Roll I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Reginald Peckham</HI> Esquire, and <HI>Katharine Peckham</HI> Widow of <HI>James Peckham</HI> his Son held it at her Death, which was in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and after her, <HI>Thomas Peckham</HI> Esquire her Descendant enjoyed it at his Decease, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and left it to his Son <HI>Reginald Peckham</HI> Esquire, who about the latter end of the above mentioned Prince passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> and he not long after alienated it to <HI>Robert Rudston</HI> Esquire, who having been entangled in the unsuccesful Design of that Knight, forfeited it to the Crown, but was reinvested again in it by a new Concession in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and much improved the ancient Structure with the increase of Building, in the years 1567 and 1576, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>Belknap Rudston</HI> Esquire, who by his
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>last Will and Testament setled it on his Kinsman Sir <HI>Francis Barnham</HI> in the year 1613, from whom it is now descended to that worthy person Mr. <HI>Robert Barnham</HI> Esquire his Son and Heir.</P>
<P><HI>Wierton House</HI> is a second place to be considered of in this Parish, it borrows its Sirname from <HI>Adam de Wierton,</HI> who as appears by old Deeds which by the Antiquity of their Character seem to commence from the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, was Possessor of this place, and having inocculated his own Name upon it, it sprouted out, not in loose Suckers and Excrescencies, but in those who were by lineal Descent from him justly and successively entituled to the Propriety of this Mannor; untill the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was by Sale transmitted to <HI>Robert Purse,</HI> and there is one of this Name; but whether this Man or his Son I am incertain who was Lord of <HI>Wierton House</HI> who lyes buryed in <HI>Boughton Church</HI> in the North Isle, with this Inscription on a Plate of Brasse affixed to the Wall, <HI>Hic jacet Robertus Purse qui obiit</HI> 145▪ <HI>&amp; bona multa huic contulit Ecclesiae;</HI> that is, he built the Belfrey and the North Isle, and those are the good Works registred in his Epitaph; and over his place of Sepulture, his Portraicture in painted Glass was preserved entire untill the eruption of the late intestine War, and then the tempestuous and ill managed, or rather overheated Zeal of these Times, which like an overheated Brain still concludes in Madnesse, disordered it into a Heap of Ruines; after this mans <HI>Exit,</HI> I do not find it acknowledged this Family long, for <HI>Robert Purse</HI> this mans Son, alienated it to <HI>Richard Norton,</HI> and his Wife <HI>Margaret Norton</HI> lyes enterr'd within that Seat which belongs to <HI>Wierton House,</HI> as the Date on her Tombstone instructs me, in the year 1470, and in this Family did the Title for many Generations inhabit untill that Age which fell under our Cognisance, and then it was demised by Sale to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who still is the Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Holbrook</HI> is the last Place to be taken Notice of in this Parish, it was anciently invol∣ved in the Demeasne of a Family which in ancient Deeds and Court Rolls were writ∣ten <HI>Halbroke,</HI> and bore, as is evident in old Registers and Armorials, <HI>Azure A plain Crosse</HI> between four <HI>Mullets Or, Frettee</HI> of the first, and having continued here many Descents, about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth languished away, and then the Propriety of this place came to confesse the Signory of <HI>Haut</HI> of <HI>Hautsbourn,</HI> and dwelt in their Patrimony untill Sir <HI>William Haut</HI> determined about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth in two Female Coheirs, whereof <HI>Joan</HI> was matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> and he in her Right was enstated in the Inheritance of this place, and about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, the Contract being fortified with his Ladyes consent, passed it away to <HI>Smith,</HI> Ancestor to Mr. ....... <HI>Smith,</HI> who still possesses it as part of his Inheritance.</P>
<P><HI>Boughton Alulph</HI> or <HI>Aluff</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wye,</HI> had this appellative Distinction united to its Name, to intimate to us, that in the <HI>Saxons</HI> Time it owned the Juris∣diction of one <HI>Alulphus</HI> a <HI>Saxon,</HI> into whose Name to derive his Memory down to us, it hath been ever since adopted; But in the Ages after the Conquest, it was wrapped up in the Estate of the ancient Family of <HI>Burgherst,</HI> now vulgarly called <HI>Burwash, Robert d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Burgherst</HI> is the first who is brought on the Stage by publick Record and presented to our Remembrance, and he held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 41. and is amongst the Register of those who accompanied that Triumphant and Succesfull Prince in his fotunate Expedition against the <HI>Scots,</HI> and he left it to his Son <HI>Stephen de Burgherst,</HI> who in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Boughton Aluff,</HI> and in the third year of that Prince, paid his Debt to Nature; from whom it descended to his Son <HI>Stephen de Burwash</HI> who had a Renovation of the former Charter of Free-warren confirmed to this Mannor in the first year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, his Son and Heirwas <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burgherst,</HI> who had a Charter of Free∣warren confirmed to all his Lands, in which this was involved in the twelfth and sixteenth years of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and was certainly a Person of much Eminence in those Times, for he is recorded by <HI>Daniell</HI> in his Chronicle to have been one of those, to whom the abovesaid Prince committed the Conduct of his Army at the Battle of <HI>Crescy,</HI> and was summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, as appears amongst
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>the Summons of that Age, he deceased in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, his Heir apparent was <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burgherst,</HI> who was Lord Chamberlain of the Kings Household, and was frequently summoned to sit as a Peere of the Realm by <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, as it appears Registered in the late printed Abridgement of the Records of the <HI>Tower;</HI> and he in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third passed away this Mannor and much other Land to <HI>Walter de Pavely;</HI> in <HI>Paveley</HI> the Possession was re∣sident but untill the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Trivet;</HI> but here it was of no long fixed continuance neither, for Sir <HI>Thomas Trivet</HI> about the fifteenth year of the abovesaid Prince passed it away to <HI>Lewis Clifford,</HI> from whom it descended to his Successor, <HI>Lewis Clifford</HI> Esquire, who in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, by a Fine then levied, transplanted his right in it into <HI>William Wenlock,</HI> and he not long after transmitted it by Sale to <HI>Richard Beauchampe</HI> Baron of <HI>Aburgavenny,</HI> whose Son <HI>Richard</HI> Baron <HI>Aburgavenny</HI> concluded in <HI>Elizabeth Beauchampe</HI> his Sole Heir, who was matched to <HI>Edward Nevil</HI> in her Right Lord of this Mannor, whose Descendants constantly remained invested in the Inheritance untill the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was alienated to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> and he dying without Issue Male, <HI>Katharine</HI> his Daughter and Coheir fastned it to the Demeasn of her Husband Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> where it hath ever since remained so constant, and per∣manent, that it now confesses the Signory of the right honourable <HI>Heneage Finch</HI> the instant Earl of <HI>Winchelsey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Seaton, Ulley,</HI> and <HI>Potbery,</HI> are three little Mannors lying within the Verge of this Pa∣rish, the first of which held in grand Serjeantie of the Crown, with this respective Ser∣vice to be performed by the Lord of the Fee, <HI>Esse vantrarius Regius quando Rex iverit in Vasconiam, donec per usus fuerit pari Solutarum pretio</HI> 4 d. which wiser Heads, who pretend to unravell the Intrigues and Criticisms of Law Latin interpret thus, to be the Kings fore Footman, when he shall go into <HI>Gasconie,</HI> untill he hath worn out a pair of Shoes, which cost 4 d. All these Mannors were wrapped up in the Demeasn of <HI>Crioll,</HI> and <HI>Bertram de Crioll</HI> died seised of them in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, whose onely Daughter <HI>Joan</HI> being matched to <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> called in some old Records Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> upon the Death of her Brother <HI>John de Crioll</HI> without Issue, entituled her Husband to that large Patrimony which called her Father Proprietary; but he dying without Issue Male, <HI>Joan</HI> his Sole Heir wedded to <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> knit together the Demeasn of <HI>Crioll</HI> and <HI>Rokesley,</HI> and cast it into his Possession; and here it made its abode untill the eleventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then the Title of these Mannors came by <HI>Eleanor</HI> the general Inheritrix of <HI>Poynings,</HI> to submit to the Dominion of <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and his Successor <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of the same place alienated them in the twenty third of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney, William Walsingham,</HI> and <HI>William Fitz Williams,</HI> and they conveyed them to Sir <HI>Christopher Hales,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>James</HI> sold them to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> by whose Coheir they devolved to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Buckwell</HI> in <HI>Boughton Alulph,</HI> was the Seat of a Family called <HI>Bekewell,</HI> as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of <HI>Henry de Bekewell,</HI> in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 72. by which he is found to have been then possest of it, and so was his Successor <HI>Henry Bekewell</HI> by a subsequent Inquisition taken in the seventeenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 97. After this Family was worn out, the Possession of this Place was united to the Inheritance of <HI>Wode,</HI> and here it remained fastned untill the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then <HI>Robert Wode</HI> passed it away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Walter Moile,</HI> Father to <HI>John Moile</HI> Esq; who was Justice of the Peace for this County, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; and from whom Mr. <HI>Robert Moile</HI> is lineally branched out, who now enjoys this Mansion: And so much for the Seat it self. The Mannor which is now entwined with it, was for the principal part of it, the Inheritance of <HI>Burg∣herst</HI> or <HI>Burwash. Robert de Burgherst</HI> possest it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 41. From whom it devolved to his Successor <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burgherst</HI> Knight of the Garter, who in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, by a Deed of Feoffment, invests it in Sir <HI>Walter de Paveley</HI> Knight likewise of the Garter; from <HI>Pavely</HI> it came over by Purchase to be the Possession of Sir <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> one of the Judges under <HI>Richard</HI> the second, who
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>having disgusted the Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> that Kings Uncle, and others of the Nobility, who were knit into a <HI>Junto,</HI> for Protection of the Peoples Liberties, against the Inroades of the Regal Prerogative, which peradventure that infortunate Person had endevoured to extend beyond its just Confines, was empeached of High Treason, convicted and banished into <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the tenth year of the above mentioned Prince, and his Estate for the most part confiscated, amongst which was his Land at <HI>Buckwell,</HI> which King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, in the twelfth year of his Rule, granted to the Dean and Canons of St. <HI>Stephens</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> and I find one <HI>Semana de Tong</HI> to have held it in Lease of that Chapiter at her Death, which was in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 29. and so did <HI>Kimberly</HI> afterwards in the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 33. After this Family was disseised, I find the <HI>Moiles</HI> to have held it as Lessees to that Covent, untill the general Dissolution in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then that Prince granted the Fee-Simple to <HI>John Moile</HI> Esquire, Son of <HI>Robert Moile</HI> Esquire, who as the Records of this Family restifie, was Justice of the Peace of this County, and one of the Esquires of the Body to that Prince, and from this <HI>John Moile</HI> is the Title by Hereditary Succession streamed into Mr. <HI>Ro∣bert Moile,</HI> who is the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Barton</HI> is another Mannor, which partly is situated in <HI>Wye,</HI> and partly in <HI>Boughton A∣lulf,</HI> and had Owners of that Sirname, who were invested in the Possession until the twenty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; and then it was conveyed to Cardinal <HI>Kempe,</HI> who setled it on his newly instituted Colledge of <HI>Wye,</HI> in whose Revenue it lay folded up, untill upon the suppression it was surrendred into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Government, and was not long after conveyed by Grant to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> and he passed it away to his Brother Mr. <HI>Walter Moile,</HI> from whom it is now descended to his Successor, Mr. <HI>Robert Moile</HI> the Heir apparent of it.</P>
<P><HI>Bocton</HI> under <HI>Bleane</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred, wherein it is placed. It was one of those Mannors which anciently belonged to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canter∣bury;</HI> but by whom it was given, because the Records of <HI>Christ Church</HI> in that par∣ticular are silent, I must, if you will look for its appraisment in the Time of the Con∣querour, <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book will inform you. <HI>Bocton,</HI> (says that Record) <HI>est Manerium Archiepiscopi, &amp; in Tempore Edwardi Regis defendebat se pro V.

<P><HI>Boughton</HI> or <HI>Bocton Court,</HI> is the first place of secular Interest which claims our Notice; it formerly (though now shrunk into a Mansion of mean Concernment) did contribute both Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, and one <HI>John de Bocton,</HI> as I discover by Deeds held it in the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> the second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third: In times more modern it is in Sir <HI>Jo. Rowths</HI> Evidences called <HI>Swayford,</HI> from the <HI>Swayfords</HI> who were next Possessors of the Fee; those who succeeded the Inheritance were the <HI>Bingers,</HI> now called <HI>Bengers,</HI> from whom the <HI>Bengers</HI> of <HI>Hougham</HI> by <HI>Dover,</HI> are issued out, and after this Name had flourished here from the entrance into the Go∣vernment of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, till towards the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh it expired, and then the <HI>Hales</HI> were the successive Proprietaries, from whom by Sale the Right was wafted over to <HI>Wood,</HI> and from this Name did a Fatality resembling the former bring it down to <HI>Rowth,</HI> in Relation to whom Sir <HI>John Rowth</HI> is now entituled to the Fee-Simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Brinley</HI> in this Patish does celebrate the Memory of Sir <HI>Laurence de Brinley,</HI> who flourished here about the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; and in this Family was it for a Series of some Descents resident, till one of them sold it to <HI>John Roper</HI> a younger Branch of the <HI>Ropers</HI> of St. <HI>Dunstans,</HI> in whose Posterity after the Title had been sometime planted, it was by a Daughter and Heir made the Inheritance of <HI>Aires;</HI> and when this Family after some abode here determined in a Daughter and Heir, the same Female Right threw it into the Revenue of the <HI>Rowths</HI> descended from the <HI>Rowths</HI> of <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> from which Alliance Sir <HI>John Rowth</HI> claims at this instant the Possession.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
<P><HI>Nash Court</HI> is a Seat of very reverend Antiquity, especially since for some Cen∣turies of years it hath been (as is apparent by their own private Evidences) the Mansion of the <HI>Hawkins,</HI> a Family of deep Descent, and illustrious Account in this Track, but made more eminent by being the Cradle of that Learned Gentle∣man Sir <HI>Thomas Hawkins,</HI> who for his accurate Translation of <HI>Caussinus</HI> his holy Court from the <HI>French</HI> Original into <HI>English,</HI> and his other well polished Labours, cannot be decyphered or limned out to Posterity under too worthy an Attribute.</P>
<P><HI>Colkins</HI> is the last place, though not of the least Account, which in this Parish is to be considered; it was built by <HI>John Colkin</HI> originally a Citizen of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and he at his Death, which was in the tenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was in possession of it; there are several of this Mans Posterity which lye entombed in <HI>Boughton</HI> with a <HI>Griffin Segreant,</HI> which was their Paternal Coat, affixed to the Front of the Gravestone, <HI>William Colkin</HI> and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife, are there enterr'd with this Inscription, <HI>Orate pro animâ Will. Colkin &amp; Agnet. Ux. qui quidem obierunt, Anno Dom.</HI> 1460. and the rest is defaced; this Mans Father <HI>John Colkin</HI> sleeps there with this Inscription annexed, to the Marble, <HI>Hic jacet Johannes Colkin qui obiito ctavo Die Aprilis, Anno Dom.</HI> 1405. But not long after the Decease of <HI>William Colkin</HI> abovesaid, did the Possession of this Seat continue permanent in this Family, for his Son <HI>John Colkin</HI> sold it to <HI>Henry Petit</HI> Father to <HI>Cirjacus</HI> or <HI>Sidrach Petit,</HI> who drew up a Survey of all the Mannors of <HI>Kent,</HI> which held by Knights Service of the Crown, in the twenty eigth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, from whom Mr. <HI>Petit</HI> the present Lord of <HI>Colkins</HI> does extract both his Descent and Title.</P>
<P><HI>Dane Court</HI> in this Parish also cannot be passed by without some Inspection: In elder Times Sir <HI>Allan de Dane</HI> challenged the Signorie of it, and as he took his Sirname from it, so he had his Habitation here, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and it continued a Mansion for his Descendants divers years after; but in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find the <HI>Foggs</HI> Lords of the Fee, the last of which that held it was Sir <HI>Jo. Fogge,</HI> who died possest of it, as appears by his Will, in the seventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and left it to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Jo. Fogge,</HI> from which Family not many years after it came to own the Propriety of <HI>Petit</HI> of <HI>Colkins,</HI> in the Descendant of which Family the Interest of it is yet resident.</P>
<P><HI>Tho. At Hurst</HI> here founded a Chappel in the eighth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and dedicated it to Saint <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which was for the use of <HI>Lazars</HI> and poor Leprous people, lodged in an Hospital not far distant of this Mans Foundation also.</P>
<P><HI>Bourdfield</HI> or <HI>Boresfield</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorn</HI> was formerly a Parish, and the remains of some part of the Stonework of the Church, as likewise the Bounds of the Church-yard are yet obvious, but since its decay it hath been incorporated into <HI>Oltringden,</HI> and is now looked upon as an Hamblet of that Parish. It was for many De∣scents the Patrimony of the Lords <HI>Cobham</HI> of <HI>Sterborough,</HI> and so continued untill <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> died in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and left one onely Daughter and Heir called <HI>Ann Cobham,</HI> who was matched with <HI>Edward Borough</HI> after in her Right as Heir General created Lord <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Sterborough,</HI> from whom this Mannor descended to his Grandchild <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Borough,</HI> who in the twenty fifth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> conveyed it to <HI>John Pakenham,</HI> and he not long after alie∣nated it to <HI>John Lewin</HI> Esquire, in which Family it remained untill our Remembrance, and then by the Heir General it was carried off to <HI>Rogers</HI> of the County of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and the like vicissitude hath by the Female Inheritrix of that Family brought it now to acknowledge <HI>Charles Cavendish</HI> Viscount <HI>Mansfield</HI> Heir apparent to <HI>William</HI> created Marquess <HI>Newcastle</HI> by the late King at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bishops-Bourn</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bredge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> is called so because it was gi∣ven by K. <HI>Kenulfus</HI> at the Request of <HI>Athelard</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> to the Priory of <HI>Christ Church,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 789, and in the Charter there is a Re∣cital of one <HI>Aldhun</HI> a pious Citizen of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who first bequeathed it to that Covent, and the Charter of Confirmation informs us that it was given to the <HI>Monks, ad Vestimentum corum,</HI> for a supply of Vesture. In the year 811. Arch-Bishop <HI>Ul∣fred</HI> exchanged <HI>Eastry</HI> of <HI>Bourn,</HI> with the Covent above mentioned, and in the De∣measne
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>of that See it lay couched untill the latter end of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, and then <HI>Tho.</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> exchanged it for other Lands with Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> who in the thirty fourth year of the abovesaid Prince conveyed it to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher</HI> Ancestor to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher</HI> Knight and Baronet, the instant Pro∣prietary both of this and <HI>Hautsbourn,</HI> which next summons a Remembrance.</P>
<P><HI>Hauts-bourn</HI> before it was enlarged with the Additional Appellation of <HI>Haut;</HI> afforded both Seat and Sirname in elder Times to a Family of venerable Antiquity in these Parts; <HI>John de Bourn</HI> lived here, and had a Charter, of Free-warren granted to it in the seventeenth year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the first; but when this Name resolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was married to <HI>Shelving,</HI> this Mannor lost the Name of <HI>Bourn,</HI> and was called by Addition <HI>Shelving Bourn,</HI> and remained sometime under that Notion, untill a Vicissitude of the same Nature with the former, entombed this in a Female Inheritrix likewise, who being married to <HI>Edw. Haut,</HI> the first Addition was removed, and wrapped up in a second, for thenceforth in publick Records it was frequently stiled <HI>Hauts-bourn,</HI> and so continued under that Name and in that Family, untill Sir <HI>William Eaut</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, dying without Issue Male, this Family determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of whom called <HI>Elizab.</HI> being matched to Sir <HI>Thowas Cole∣peper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> brought <HI>Bourn</HI> to be the Inheritance of that Family, and he in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passed it away to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> descen∣ded from <HI>Aucherus</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> who was of eminent Note at <HI>Newenden</HI> in this Coun∣ty, of whom more shall be spoken when I come to treat of that place.</P>
<P><HI>Bursted</HI> is the last Place to be taken Notice of in this Parish, which in ancient Deeds is written <HI>Burghsted,</HI> and was the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname, but the cheifest Honour which it acquired in times of a more modern Aspect, is, that for several Descents last past it hath constantly confessed it self to be part of the pro∣priety and Patrimony of <HI>Denne,</HI> a Cadet of the <HI>Denns</HI> of <HI>Denne Hill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boxley</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Maidston,</HI> had an Abby filled with Cistertian Monks, and founded by <HI>William de Iper</HI> of <HI>Flanders,</HI> advanced by King <HI>Stephen</HI> to be Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> in the year 1145; K. <HI>Richard</HI> the first, as the Register of this Abby denotes, was a great Bene∣factor to the Covent, who were originally transported hither from <HI>Clarevall</HI> in <HI>Burgun∣dy;</HI> upon the Suppression, the House with the Demeasne adjacent was in the thirty second of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> Father to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> one of his Privy Counsel, a man of an unbroken though a calamitous Virtue, who thinking it a lesse stain to forfeit his Estate, then to debauch his Consience, stuck close to that Sacramental Covenant, by which he and the rest of the Councel had oblieged themselves to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to preserve as much as in them lay his two Daughters <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> from confederating with any forreign Alliance, and so engaged in that Design which over set him, and sunk him and his Patrimony into that Ruine; we find him and it lost at present, for upon his Attainder, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in the second year of her Reign, granted out his Estate as if it were by Retail to several sons, but this Mannor and some other small peices were given back to the Lady <HI>Joan Wiat</HI> his Widow, for the support of her self and Family; and this is all which of that vast and wide Revenue of his, which lay scattered in this and other Counties is held by his Posterity at this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Wevering</HI> in this Parish is a Mannor held by Knights Service, and <HI>Waretius de Shel∣ving</HI> Son of <HI>John Shelving,</HI> and <HI>Hellen de Bourn</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>John de Bourn</HI> held it by this Tenure, to find a Horse for the Kings Army in <HI>Wales; Cum uno Sacco &amp; Brochiâ pro Esquilar ipsius Domini Regis,</HI> so it runs in the Latin Record taken in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; after this mans Decease, <HI>John de Shelving</HI> was this mans Heir, and in his Right enjoyed this Mannor, though it was not wholly his till he married <HI>Benedicta</HI> Daughter and Coheir of <HI>Robert de Hougham,</HI> who likewise held some part of it, and then he transmitted it entire to his Son <HI>William Shelving,</HI> whose Sole Daughter and Heir being married to <HI>Edward Haut</HI> of <HI>Hauts Place</HI> in <HI>Petham,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, this and an opulent Demeasne beside became interwoven with the Revenue of that Family; and here the Possession seemed to be laid up till Sir <HI>William Haut</HI> of <HI>Hautsbourn,</HI> this mans great Grandchild dyed and left only two Coheirs, <HI>Joan</HI> matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="52"/>married to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> so wavering by this Alliance accrued to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> from whom in the twenty fourth year of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> it was by forfeiture torne away, but was in the twenty fourth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> restored with the Mannor of <HI>Boxley</HI> to the Lady <HI>Joan Wiat,</HI> Widow of the abovesaid Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> and her Son <HI>George Wiat</HI> for three Lifes; the Reversion was sold by King <HI>Charles</HI> to Mr. <HI>Stephen Alcock</HI> who alienated the Fee Simple to Sir <HI>Francis Wiat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vinters</HI> is contained also in <HI>Boxley,</HI> it gave Seat and Sirname to as noble a Family and of as deep Antiquity as any in this Track; <HI>Roger Vinter</HI> lived here, who was one of the Conservators of the Peace for the County of <HI>Kent</HI> in the eighteenth year of the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, he deceased in the forty seventh of the abovesaid Princes Government, and <HI>John Vinter</HI> was his Heir, who sold <HI>Vinter,</HI> to <HI>Fremingham</HI> in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, from whom it was conveyed by a Female Inheritrix to <HI>Isley</HI> of <HI>Sundrich,</HI> and here it rested till Sir <HI>Henry Isley</HI> being folded up in the same attempt with Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> upon the blasting of that Designe forfeited his Interest in it to the Crown; Queen <HI>Mary</HI> granted it to <HI>Cutts,</HI> who some years after devested himself of his right in it, and by Sale disposed of it to Sir <HI>Cavaliero Maycott,</HI> who suddenly alienated it to <HI>Covert,</HI> who transferred it by the like Devo∣lution, about some five and twenty years since to Sir <HI>John Tufton</HI> Knight Baro∣net, whose second Son Sir <HI>Charles Tufton,</HI> upon the late Decease of his Brother Sir <HI>Benedict Tufton</HI> is the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to mention, which certainly must much improve the Honour of this Place, that King <HI>Edward</HI> the second in the fifteenth year of his Reign lying at <HI>Boxley</HI> Abby granted the Charter to <HI>London,</HI> to elect yearly one of the City at their own pleasure to be their Maior.</P>
<P><HI>Boughton Malherbe</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> did very probably take its Deno∣mination from a Family of that Sirname, who were of eminent Account in the County of <HI>Devon;</HI> for I find Sir <HI>William de Malherbe</HI> was witnesse to a Deed of <HI>Reginald de Mohun,</HI> by which he gives much Land to the Abby of <HI>Axminster,</HI> as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 14. <HI>Hen. tertii Memb.</HI> 33. <HI>parte prima.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, by several old Deeds I discover it to be marshalled in the List of those Lands which confessed <HI>Robert de Gatton</HI> Son of <HI>Robert de Gatton,</HI> (who was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae</HI> in the second year of King <HI>John</HI>) to have been its Proprietarie, and he dyed possest of it in the forty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it to his Son <HI>Hamo de Gatton,</HI> in whom the male Line determined; so that this Mannor upon the Partition of his Inheritance, devolved by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Daughter and Coheir to be the Patrimony of <HI>William de Dene,</HI> who obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands here, in the renth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; but he not long after enjoyed the Benefit of this priviledge, for he conveyed it to <HI>Robert Corbie,</HI> who in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third had Licence by this Princes Grant to build after a fortified Mannor, the Terms are <HI>Kernellare &amp; Turrellare,</HI> that is, to make Cranies and Loopholes to discharge Crossebows and other missile Weapons, and to embattel with Towers and Curtain Walls the Mannor House at <HI>Boughton;</HI> from him it descen∣ded to <HI>Robert Corby</HI> his Son and Heir, who dyed and left only one Daughter and Heir <HI>Joan</HI> marryed to Sir <HI>Nicholas Wotton</HI> twice Lord Maior of <HI>London;</HI> and so by Female Right this Mannor became the Possession of this Family, and in a continued Series was it carryed down from Sir <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton</HI> not many years since deceased, whose Lady Dowager <HI>Mary</HI> Daughter and one of the Coheirs of Sir <HI>Arthur Throgmorton</HI> of <HI>Paulers Perry</HI> in the County of <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> as parcel of her Joynture, did lately before her Decease enjoy it.</P>
<P><HI>Colbridge</HI> Castle lay in <HI>Boughton Malherbe,</HI> under the Hill towards <HI>Headcorne,</HI> and hath found a Sepulcher now under its own Rubbish; King <HI>Henry</HI> the third in the forty third of his Reign granted Licence by his Charter to Sir <HI>Fulke Peyforer,</HI> to fortifie and build after a Castle-like Manno this Mansion House at <HI>Colbrge;</HI> it came after to be the Possession of <HI>Roger</HI> Lord <HI>Leybourne,</HI> and from him did descend to <HI>Juliana Leybourne,</HI> his Sole Heir, who matching with <HI>William Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Hunting∣ton</HI> made it his Inheritance; but he deceasing in the twenty eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third without Issue, and his Lady after dying and leaving no visibleor avowed Alli¦ance,
<PB N="91" REF="52"/>knit to her by the indisputable tye of Consanguinity to claim it, it escheated to the Crown, and K. <HI>Richard</HI> the second in the twenty first of his Reign granted it to the Royal Chappel of St. <HI>Stevens</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> where it remained till the Dissolution, and then it was granted in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth to Sir <HI>Edward Wotton,</HI> from whom by a successive Right of Descent it was transmitted to his great Grandchild <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton</HI> of <HI>Marley,</HI> whose Widow the Lady <HI>Mary Wotton</HI> does at this instant possess it.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Chilston</HI> is an eminent Seat and Mannor likewise situated within the Precincts of this Parish: In the fifty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Henry Hussey</HI> had a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannor of <HI>Chilston,</HI> and his Grandchild <HI>Henry Hussey</HI> died seised of it in the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and in this Family was the Inhe∣ritance in an undivided Succession resident till our Grandfathers Memory, and then <HI>Henry Hussey</HI> by Sale translated the Proprietie into <HI>John Parkhurst,</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>William Parkhurst</HI> alienated it to <HI>Richard Northwood,</HI> whose Son Mr. <HI>Oliver North∣wood</HI> by the same transmission passed it over to <HI>Cieggat;</HI> he very lately disposed of his Concernment in it to Mr. <HI>Manly</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who very lately hath conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> Grandchild to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> of <HI>Tunstal</HI> Knight and Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Buckland</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was (as <HI>Sidrach Petits</HI> Inquest into the Man∣nors of <HI>Kent</HI> informs me) as high as the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Possession of <HI>John de Buckland,</HI> who it seems extracted his Sirname from hence, and is likewise mentioned in <HI>Testa de Nevil</HI> to have held Land in this Track in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third: But before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, this Family was vanished from this place, and immediately after they were gone out, the <HI>Frogenhalls</HI> of <HI>Fro∣genhall</HI> in <HI>Tenham,</HI> were entituled to the Possession, and <HI>Richard Frogenhall</HI> was seised of it at his Decease, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 37. and from him did it descend to <HI>John Frogenhall</HI> Esquire, who was with <HI>Edmund Brook</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> then Ceneral of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Forces under <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> at the Battle of <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> where the House of <HI>Lancaster</HI> by that vigorous Assistance the <HI>Kentish</HI> men that day afforded the House of <HI>York,</HI> received so fatal a Wound, that all the Art of the <HI>Lancastian</HI> Partisans, could hardly ever after close it; and this Man had Issue <HI>Thomas Frogenhall,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, passed it away to <HI>Gedding;</HI> and <HI>Thomas Gedding,</HI> in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, held this Mannor, and conveyed it by Deed to <HI>Henry Atsea</HI> of <HI>Herne;</HI> and he in the thirtieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth was possest of it at his Death, and from him did the Thread of Descent guide the Title down to his Grandchild <HI>William Atsea,</HI> who in the tenth year of King <HI>James</HI> conveyed it by Sale to ....... <HI>Saker</HI> of <HI>Feversham</HI> Gentleman, whose Son Mr. <HI>Christopher Saker</HI> in our Fathers Memory alienated it to Sir <HI>Basill Dixwell</HI> of <HI>Terlingham</HI> in <HI>Folkstone</HI> Knight and Baronet, who upon his Decease about the year 1641, gave it to his Kinsman Mr. <HI>John Dixwell</HI> Esquire, in whom the Possession is still resident.</P>
<P><HI>Buckland</HI> by <HI>Dover</HI> is situated in the Hundred of <HI>Bewsborough,</HI> and was a Branch of that spacious and wide Demeasn which made the Patrimony of <HI>Hamon de Crevequer</HI> so considerable in this County, and he held it at his Decease, which was in the forty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 33. Afterwards I find the <HI>Wilghebies</HI> or <HI>Willoughbies</HI> invested in the Possession, and <HI>Thomas de Willoughbie</HI> was seised of it at his Decease, which was in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second: But the Title had no long residence in this Family, for in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Barrie</HI> of <HI>Sevington;</HI> for <HI>Agnes</HI> Wife of <HI>William Barrie</HI> was possest of it in Right of Dower, as appears by an Inquisition taken after her Death in the forty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 7. After the <HI>Barries</HI> were worn out, the <HI>Callards</HI> or <HI>Calwards,</HI> now vulgarly called <HI>Collard,</HI> became Lords of the Fee, a Family of deep Extraction in this Track, and who were in elder Times entituled to the Possession of Land and Houses in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as appears by a Composition made between the <HI>Monks</HI> of St. <HI>Austins</HI> and those of <HI>Christ Church,</HI> in the forty first of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, recited by Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> in his Survey of that City, Pag. 192. wherein it is mentioned that the Abby of St. <HI>Austins</HI> had purchased Land and Houses of <HI>Iohn
<PB N="92" REF="53"/>Calward.</HI> But to proceed, after this Family had for divers Descents held this Man∣nor in a fair repute, (<HI>John Callard</HI> Esquire, being one of those who accompanied Sir <HI>Henry Guldford</HI> of this County to serve <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Castile</HI> in his War commenced against the <HI>Moors,</HI> where for some Signal Service performed against those Infidels, he had this Coat assigned to him and his Posterity, by <HI>Clarenceux Benolt, vid.

<P><HI>Dudmanscombe</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which in elder times made up the Revenue of the Priorie of St. <HI>Martins</HI> in <HI>Dover,</HI> and continued annexed to that Cloister until the general Suppression, and then being torn from the Church, it was again exchanged with <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth of his Reign, and so remained wound up in the Demeasn of that Sea, untill that ruinous and fatal popular Tempest which arose in these Times supplanted it, and cast it into the Possession of a secular Interest.</P>
<P><HI>Burham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Lark field</HI> is in <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book written <HI>Burgham,</HI> and was in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour held by <HI>Ralph de Curva Spina.</HI> In Ages of a lower Approach to us, I find it under the Signorie of <HI>Jeffrey de Say,</HI> and he died possest of it in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 48. and for the future remained so chained to the Propriety of this Family, that it was esteemed Parcel of their Barony of <HI>Birling,</HI> and when <HI>Jeffrey</HI> Lord <HI>Say</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second ended in two Female Coheirs, one matched to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> and the other called <HI>Joan,</HI> wedded to Sir <HI>William Fiennes,</HI> this upon the Division of the Estate accrued to <HI>Fiennes,</HI> and coming again by the Heir General of <HI>Fiennes</HI> Lord <HI>Dacres</HI> to be possest by <HI>Leonard, William Leonard</HI> Son and Heir of <HI>Fiennes Leonard,</HI> a younger Branch of that House, hath lately passed it away to Mr. <HI>Francis Barnham,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Edward Maplesden.</HI></P>
<P>There was in old Time a Fountain within the Limits of this Parish at a place called <HI>Haly-Garden,</HI> venerable it was, and of no small Account amonst the People, who for the sanctitie they conceived was in it, ascribed divine Attributes unto it, as the Name imports for what we call Holy, our Ancestors long time since styled <HI>Halyg,</HI> as <HI>Halyfax</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> from <HI>holy Haire,</HI> that that the People devoutly esteemed, and frequently with blind credulity visited. In the seventeenth of K. <HI>Richard</HI> the second, the Friars <HI>Carmelites</HI> of <HI>Alresford</HI> obtained a Grant by Letters Patents to bring the Water from that Fountain in <HI>Haly-Garden</HI> to their Monastery in <HI>Alres∣ford,</HI> to what purpose, they that will survey the Designs of the <HI>Monks</HI> of those Times, may easily discover.</P>
<P><HI>Burmersh</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Worth</HI> was a Member of that Patrimony, which in Times of a higher Calculation, related to the Abby of St. <HI>Augustines</HI> in <HI>Canterbury:</HI> and had here a Mansion called <HI>Abbots Court,</HI> which is an Adjunct to this Mannor, and had this Denomination imposed upon it, because the Abbot of that Covent used to sojourn here when he came to survey that Demeasn, which augmented the Revenue of that Abby, and lay spread into <HI>Romney Mersh.</HI> This Mannor upon the Surrender of the Patrimony of that Cloister into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, was in the thirty fifth of that Prince granted to <HI>William Finch</HI> Esquire, whose Successor Sir <HI>Thomas Finch</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchelsey</HI> not many years since passed it away to Sir <HI>Ralph Whitfield</HI> Serjeant at Law, whose Son and Heir Sir <HI>Herbert Whitfield</HI> is now Lord of the Fee.</P>

<P>The Mannor of <HI>Dodindale</HI> had originally owners of that Name, for as Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> in his Survey of <HI>Canterbury</HI> out of the Records of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> instructs us, <HI>Haymo</HI> the Son of <HI>Guido de Dodindale,</HI> gave the Tithes of <HI>Dodindale</HI> to the Priory of St. <HI>Augustins:</HI> But it seems it was but for certain years, for in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second (as the same Records testifie) <HI>Robert de Marci</HI> gave the Tithes of this place, to the Hospital of St. <HI>Laurence;</HI> so far he in that laborious Peice of his hath exhibit∣ed to the publick view who were its ancient Possessors when it bore the Name of <HI>Dodindale;</HI> now out of the private Evidences it must be my Task who were its Propri∣etaries since it carried the Name of <HI>Morton;</HI> By a Deed without date <HI>Elias de Morton</HI> (from whom it assumed the Name of <HI>Morton,</HI> which hath clove to it ever since) de∣mises the Fee-simple of it to <HI>Hugh Fitzvinon,</HI> a Family which had large possessions at <HI>Selling</HI> by <HI>Monks Horton,</HI> whose Daughter <HI>Eugenia Fitzvinon</HI> passes it away by Deed to <HI>Nicholas de Twitham</HI> in the twentyeth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and he immediately after by a Deed not bounded with any date, settles it in <HI>Robert de Polre;</HI> but whether his Successor sold it to <HI>J. Chich</HI> or not, is incertain, because there is a vacancy or gap in in the private Evidences, though the Records of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> make him to have some Interest in it in the year 1330.

<PB N="94" REF="54"/>did not long fix here, for he in the thirty third year of the abovesaid Prince, transmits all his concernment in it by sale to <HI>William Barton</HI> and <HI>John Whete,</HI> and they by mutual consent in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth alienate it to <HI>Edward Pargate,</HI> who transmitted it to his Son and Heir <HI>John Pargate,</HI> from whom descended <HI>Edward Pargate</HI> who in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth demises it to <HI>Peter Bruin;</HI> and after the Title had many years united to this Family, <HI>Henry Bruin</HI> dying without Issue gave it to his Sister <HI>Jane Bugge</HI> who in the first year of King <HI>James</HI> cast her Right by Sale into her Kinsman <HI>John Bruin,</HI> who in the fifth year of that Prince by the same alienation translated the Title into <HI>William Denne,</HI> who deceasing without Issue Male, <HI>Margaret</HI> his only Daughter and Heir brought it over to her husband <HI>Edw.

Chich</HI> was was Bai∣liff of <HI>Canterbury</HI> 1259. and again in the year 1271. was a principal Benefactor to the Church of S. <HI>Mary Bredin</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> whose Name in an old Character, together with his Effigies, are set up in the west Window, as his Coat is likewise in Stone-work in the Chancell; <HI>John Chich</HI> was Bailiff of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the twenty third, and again in the twenty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the year 1320. <HI>Robert Malling</HI> then Commissary of <HI>Canterbury</HI> gave Sentence upon clear Evidence by ancient muniments and otherwise, that the Hospital of St. <HI>Laurence</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> should not only receive the Tithes of the Mannor of the <HI>Dungeon,</HI> but likewise of 300. Acres adjacient to it, but this was not without the Tye or Tribute of some Remuneration, for in Autumne <HI>John Chich</HI> who was then Lord of the <HI>Dungeon,</HI> was to receive for his Servants five loaves of Bread, two Pitchers and an half of Beer, and half a Cheese of four pence; and he himself was to receive <HI>unum par Cirocecarum ferinarum,</HI> one pair of Holyday Gloves, and one pound of Wax in Candles, and for his Servants three pair of Gloves; <HI>Thomas Chich</HI> this mans Son was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the forty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shrivealtie at the <HI>Dungeon,</HI> but in <HI>Valantine Chich</HI> this mans great Grandchild, not only the male line but likewise the possession of this place fai∣led, for he about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth passed it away to <HI>Roger Brent</HI> Esq; and he died seised of it (as appears by his Will recorded at <HI>Canterbury</HI>) in the year 1486. But in this Family it was not long after this resident, for in the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by an old Court Roll I find one <HI>John Butler</HI> of <HI>Heronden</HI> in <HI>Eastrye</HI> possest of it, and he conveyed it to Sir <HI>John Hales</HI> Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and when <HI>Leland</HI> visited <HI>Kent,</HI> which was in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, he lived here, and from him is it now come down to his Successor Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> the instant Pro∣prietarie of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moate, alias Wyke,</HI> is a third Mannor within the precincts of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and had owners of that Sirname; For I read in <HI>Testa de Nevill</HI> that <HI>Stephen de VVyke</HI> possest it in the twentyeth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and paid respective Aid for it at the marri∣age of <HI>Isabel</HI> that Princes Sister; and in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> where there is an Enumera∣tion of the ancient owners, there is a Recital of <HI>Stephen de Wyke, William le Taylour, John Tancrey,</HI> and <HI>Richard Betts,</HI> who had an Interest in it; but before the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, all these Families were mouldred away and vanished: For in that Kings Reign I find it by the Court Rolls of this place in the hands of Sir <HI>Richard de Hoo,</HI> and <HI>Richard Skippe,</HI> and they about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second by deed convey∣ed it to <HI>Simon Spencer,</HI> and he some few years after alienated it to <HI>John Standford</HI> Gentle∣man, who suddenly after Passed it away to <HI>Richard Smith,</HI> in whose hands it had not long continued, when the same Devolution brought it over to <HI>John Eastfield</HI> Esquire, Son of Sir <HI>William Eastfield</HI> who was Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> and Lord Maior of <HI>London</HI> in the year 1438. and from him it was by Sale carried off to <HI>William Rogers,</HI> and he by a Fine levied in the thirty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth demises and sells it to <HI>Philip Belknap</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> Esquire, Maior of that City in the year 1458. and Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; he married <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Daughter of <HI>John Wood∣house</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>Esq; by whom he had Issue <HI>Alice</HI> his only Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Henry Finch</HI> of <HI>Nitherfield</HI> Esq; Father of Sir <HI>William Finch</HI> Banneret, who in his Mothers right was invested in the possession of the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> and from him is it now by Successive right devolved to the Right Honourable <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Finch,</HI> created Baron of <HI>Fordwich</HI> by the late K. <HI>Charles,</HI> when he was Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Dunstans</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> was the Ancient Seat of the noble Family of <HI>Roper, VVilliam Rosper</HI> or <HI>de Rubra Spathâ</HI> for so the Name is written in old Dateless Evi∣dences, and <HI>Elnith</HI> his Wife the Daughter and Heir of <HI>Edward de Apuldore,</HI> flou∣rished in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and were great Benefactors to the Priorie of Saint <HI>Martins</HI> in <HI>Dover, Iohn de Rubrâ Spathâ,</HI> or <HI>Rosper</HI> did eminent Service in <HI>Scotland</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> the third, for which that Prince rewards him and <HI>William Clifford</HI> (as appears by a Deed recorded in the Earl of <HI>Dorsets</HI> Pedigree) about the twenty ninth year of his Reign, with the third part of those Forfeitures that were due from the <HI>Jews</HI> then inhabiting in <HI>London,</HI> for the Violation of some Penal Statutes enected against them. <HI>Edmund</HI> Son of <HI>Ralph Roper</HI> was an eminent Man in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, under whom he was Justice of the Peace for this County, and died the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth 1433, and lies buried in this Church of St. <HI>Dunstans; John Roper</HI> his Son, and <HI>John VVestcliffe,</HI> as the Records of this Family instruct me, were Correctors and Surveyours of the Customes of the Cinque Ports in the ninteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh: <HI>Jo. Roper</HI> his Grandchild was Attorney General to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and Prothonotary of the Kings Bench, as appears by the Inscription on his Monument in St. <HI>Dunstans</HI> Church 1524, and <HI>VVill. Roper</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the first and second year of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and matched with <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> who (as the Inscription on her Monument) was <HI>Graecis Latinisque Literis Doctissima,</HI> succeeded his Father in the Office of Prothonotary of the Kings Bench, which he discharged with much of Fidelity and Care fifty four years, and left it to his Sor <HI>Thomas Roper</HI> Esquire 1577, in which year he died; and from this <HI>Thomas</HI> is this Mannor of St. <HI>Dunstans,</HI> which for so many Centuries of years hath constantly con∣fessed the Signorie of this Name, now descended to his great Grandchild Mr. <HI>Edward Roper</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Capell</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Folkstone</HI> was parcel of that Estate which celebrated the Family of <HI>Averenches</HI> to have been its Proprieraries, which continued no longer in the Name then the End of K. <HI>John;</HI> for then <HI>William de Averenches</HI> dying without Issue Male, <HI>Matilda</HI> his onely Daughter and Heir brought <HI>Capell</HI> with the two little Man∣nors, <HI>Halton</HI> and <HI>Wolverton alias Wolton,</HI> to be possest by <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> called in the Language of those times, the great Lord of <HI>Kent;</HI> from him they descended to his Son and Heir <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> who dying about the forty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third without Issue, his Estate in <HI>Kent</HI> and elsewhere was seised on by that Prince, as having died in Actual Arms against him, but was by the Act of Pacifica∣tion made at <HI>Kenelworth</HI> in the fiftieth year of his Reign restored to his four Sisters, whereof one was espoused to <HI>John de Lenham,</HI> the second was matched first to <HI>Nicholas de Sandwich,</HI> and next to <HI>John de Segrave; Matilda</HI> the third was wedded to <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> and the fourth was married to <HI>William de Pateshull;</HI> but upon the Division of the Estate, <HI>Capell,</HI> with its two Appendages <HI>Halton</HI> and <HI>Wolton,</HI> accrued to <HI>Crioll,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir they came to Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> and then by <HI>Joan</HI> his Sole Inheritrix to <HI>Tho. de Peynings;</HI> in which Family they remained untill the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then Sir <HI>Edward Poynings</HI> dying without any lawfull Issue, they came by <HI>Mary</HI> his natural Daughter to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> to whom they were by Grant confirmed in the thirtieth of that Princes Reign, and he in the second year of Q. <HI>Mary</HI> passed them away to Mr. <HI>Henry Herdson,</HI> whose Grand∣child Mr. <HI>Francis Herdson</HI> conveyed them to his Uncle Mr. <HI>John Herdson,</HI> and he dying without Issue, setled them on his Kinsman Sir <HI>Basil Dixwell</HI> Knight and Baronet, whose Kinsman Mr. <HI>Basill Divwell</HI> of <HI>Broome</HI> in <HI>Barham</HI> is now Proprietarie of them.</P>
<P><HI>Caldham</HI> high mounted, is another Mannor in this Parish, which informs us, that in elder times a Family of that Denomination held it, which before the End of
<PB N="96" REF="55"/><HI>Richard</HI> the second had passed it away to <HI>Baker,</HI> a Family of good Account in this Track, who had a peculiar Chancel belonging to them in <HI>Folkstone</HI> Church near the Vestry Door over the Charnell House; <HI>John Baker</HI> was Gentleman Porter of <HI>Callis</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth and sixth, and dying without Issue male, <HI>Robert Brandred</HI> who had matched with one of his two Coheirs was planted in the Possession, and he about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Brown,</HI> whose Grandchild Sir <HI>Matthew Brown</HI> exchanged it with <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth about the thirty sixth of his Reign, and he granted it away to <HI>William Wilford, John Bennet</HI> and <HI>George Brigges;</HI> and they in the thirty seventh of his Government alienated their Right in this place to <HI>John Tufton</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to the right Honourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanett,</HI> who still possesses the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Charlton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackheath,</HI> anciently written <HI>Ceopleton;</HI> that is, the Town inhabited with honest, good, stout and usefull men for Tillage, and Country businesse; It anciently belonged to <HI>William Fitz Oger,</HI> as <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book saith, and was after given to the Monastery of <HI>Bermondsey</HI> neer <HI>Southwarke,</HI> by <HI>Robert Bloett</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincoln, Anno sexto Willielmi Secundi.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the third gave the Prior of that House Liberty by his Charter in the fifty third year of his Reign to hold a Market there weekly, and a Fair once in every yeer, three days together, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the <HI>Eve,</HI> upon <HI>Trinity Sunday,</HI> and two days after; the Market was held weekly upon the Monday, and was not long since ciscontinued; but the Fair is not disused but kept yearly upon St. <HI>Lukes</HI> day, and called Horn Fair, by reason of the great plenty of all Sorts of Winding Hornes, and Cups, and other Vessels of Horn there brought to be sold. King <HI>James</HI> granted the Mannor to Sir <HI>Adam Newton</HI> Knight and Baronet, Tutor to Prince <HI>Henry;</HI> who there hath built a goodly brave House, and left the Care with his Cost, to enlarge and beautify Gods House, the Parish Church, to Sir <HI>David Comingham</HI> Knight and Baronet, late Coforer to Prince <HI>Charles;</HI> Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> his Brother, and Mr. <HI>Peter Newton</HI> Gentleman Usher to the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> who have most amply discharged that Trust, and in a manner new builded a great Part thereof, and erected the Steeple new from the Ground, and furnished it with a good Ring of Bells, decorating the same Church without and within so worthily that it surpasseth most in the Shire.</P>
<P><HI>Kedbroke</HI> neer <HI>Charlton</HI> was formerly a Parish, but when the Church decayed, and the paucity of the Inhabitants could not support the Charge that was to maintain the same, they were by Composition annexed to <HI>Charlton;</HI> it is of late become of better Note since it pleased King <HI>Charles</HI> to create Sir <HI>William Harvey</HI> Knight and Baronet, and Baron <HI>Harvey</HI> of <HI>Rosse</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> a Peer of this Realm; also by the Name of Baron <HI>Harvey</HI> of <HI>Kedbroke:</HI> it being part of his Ladies Inheritance, as being Daughter and one of the three Coheirs of <HI>Brian Annesley</HI> Esquire, who having it in Lease from the Crown, bought the Fee-simple of <HI>Edward Blunt</HI> of <HI>Wrickelmersh</HI> Esquire, to whom it was conveyed by his Father in Law, Sir <HI>William Garaway</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> Knight, who had purchased it of King <HI>James</HI> in the Beginning of his Government; to whose Royal Demeasne it had been fastned ever since the Suppression of the Priory of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> (in whose Patrimony it was involved) in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P>In the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pat.</HI> 26. <HI>Hen. sexti Parte se∣cunda Memb.</HI> 27.</NOTE> the Church of <HI>Kedbroke</HI> was appropriated to the Priory of St. <HI>Mary Overies</HI> in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> the Vicarage not endowed, but being shrunk into Decay and Solitude, the Inhabitants for many yeers last past have resorted for the performance of Divine Duties to the Parish Church of <HI>Charlton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chalke</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> was parcel of that Demeasne which related to the Abby of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> as appears by <HI>Kirkbies</HI> Inquest, a Book kept in the Exche∣quer, and collected in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, wherein that Cloister is represented to have had the Possession of this place at that Time; and here it re∣mained untill the generall Dissolution snatched it away in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and that Prince afterwards devolved it to Sir <HI>George Brook,</HI> from whom it descended to his Great Grandchild Sir <HI>William Brook,</HI> who dying in the year 1643 without Issue male, it came over to his Kinsman Sir <HI>Jon Brook</HI> as Reversioner in En∣tail, and he some few years since passed it away to <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> lately
<PB N="97" REF="55"/>deceased, whose Son <HI>Esme Stuart</HI> now Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> is the Heir Apparent of it.</P>
<P><HI>Felborough Clam Lane</HI> and <HI>Rainhurst</HI> were a Limb of that wide Revenue which lay scattered and diffused over the face of all this Hundred, and acknowledged it self to be under the Signory of the Family of <HI>Cobham; Henry de Cobham</HI> held them, as ap∣pears by <HI>Kirkbies</HI> Inquest, in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and so did his Grand∣child <HI>John de Cobham</HI> in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 43. <HI>Parte secunda.</HI> And in this Family and its Descendants did they settle, until the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then by an old Survey of <HI>Chalke,</HI> I find them in the Hands of <HI>Brent,</HI> and continued in their Possession until the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then <HI>Jo. Brent</HI> Esq; conveys them, as appears by a Fine levied in that year to Sir <HI>Henry Wiat,</HI> and his infortunate Grandchild Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> having by an un∣successeful Solleviation or Rising, forfeited them to the Crown in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> they remained there until Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the thirty seventh of her Rule granted them in Lease to Sir <HI>Peter Manwood,</HI> who passed it to <HI>Menfield,</HI> and he to Mr. <HI>James Crispe,</HI> but the Fee-simple still remained lodged in the Royal Revenue, until the late King <HI>Charles</HI> passed it away to the City of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1630, and that City the same year they were granted, conveyed them to Mr. <HI>James Crispe,</HI> who upon his Departure disposed them by Testament to his two Sons Mr. <HI>Thomas Crispe</HI> and Mr. <HI>James Crispe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Challock</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calehill</HI> hath two places in it, which may deservedly come within the Register of those Mannors which are in this Survey to be recorded: The first is <HI>Otterpley,</HI> which was an eminent Seat belonging to the ancient Family of <HI>Apulderfield.</HI> The first that I find of Note in any publick Record to have possest it, was <HI>Henry de Apulderfield,</HI> who had the Grant of a Market and Fayre to his Mannor of <HI>Apulderfield</HI> in <HI>Coldham,</HI> in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the third; and this mans great Grandchild <HI>Henry de Apulderfield</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the fiftieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Challock.</HI> His House was near <HI>East-well</HI> in the Earl of <HI>Winchel∣seys</HI> upper Park, called <HI>Apulderfields Garden,</HI> which is now so obscured in its own Ruins, that we now with Difficulty trace out its Sepulcher, made up of its own complicated Rubbish; but this Mannor, as to some Proportion of it, was passed away before he was Sheriff, to <HI>Edmund de Hant,</HI> who held it at his Decease, which was in the forty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; but neither of these Families lasted longer then the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; for then I find it entirely invested in <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Poynings,</HI> who in the eleventh year of that Prince was possest of it at his Death, and left it to his Sole Heir, <HI>Eleanor</HI> matched to <HI>Henry Percy</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in whose Successors the Right was constantly fixed, until the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was conveyed by <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney, William Walsingham,</HI> and <HI>William Fitz-Williams,</HI> and they immediately after re-conveyed it to Sir <HI>Christopher Hales,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth alienated it to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> by whose Daughter and Co∣heir <HI>Katharine,</HI> it came to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> unhappily Ship∣wract by <HI>New-Haven</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> a Person who deserved a longer Life, and not so dark a Fate; from whom by paternal Descent it is now transmitted to the right honourable <HI>Heneage Finch</HI> now Earl of <HI>Winchelsey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Loringden</HI> and <HI>Deane</HI> are places in <HI>Challock</HI> worthy of Consideration. There is a Tradition very frequent amongst the Country people in this Track, that <HI>Loringden</HI> now altogether desolate and full of solitude, was once the Mansion of Gentlemen of this Name, one of which should have waged Combate with one of the <HI>Apulderfields</HI> of <HI>Otterpley</HI> not far distant, about building a Chappel in the Valley, which was pretended by <HI>Loringden</HI> to be erected on Land that was of his Fee-simple; but because this without some more solid Foundation to support then Fame and Vulgar Report, will appear but legend, I will re-present to you what the original Muniments and Evidences have discovered to me in Relation to those who were Possessors of this place. That there was a Family which bore the Name of <HI>Lourdingden</HI> or <HI>Loringden,</HI> is most certain, for there is a place in <HI>Challock</HI> which yet continues the Name of <HI>Lo∣rindens Forestal;</HI> but when I consulted the private Evidences of this place, I found upon a serious Disquition they reached no higher then <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and in his
<PB N="98" REF="56"/>Reign, it acknowledged it self to be of the Propriety of <HI>Cadman,</HI> a Family grown into a reverend esteem by a long Prescription in this Track; but the Name of <HI>Dean</HI> con∣tinued in being till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and was in very ancient Deeds, some of which are not limited with any Date, written <HI>At Dean</HI> and <HI>A Dean,</HI> and in that Princes Reign was by Sale passed away to the above mentioned Family of <HI>Cadman;</HI> in which Name both <HI>Loringdean</HI> and <HI>Dean</HI> remained clapsed up, till the entrance of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then by a Sole Daughter and Heir they went over to <HI>Plomer,</HI> who almost in our Memory transferred his Right in both of them by Sale to <HI>Peirce.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Challock</HI> being fallen down, was new erected by the <HI>Apulderfields,</HI> as the Glass windows and Stone work in divers places, embroider'd and diaper'd with the <HI>Voided Cross,</HI> which was their paternal Coat Armour, do more then sufficiently testifie.</P>
<P><HI>Cranebrook</HI> gives name to the Hundred wherein it is seated, a Town very po∣pulous, in respect it was one of the first places where the Manufacture of Clothing was professed and practised, being brought into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Edward</HI> the thirds Reign, who by proposing rewards, and granting many Immunities, trained <HI>Flemings</HI> into this Nation in the tenth year of his reign, to teach the <HI>English</HI> that Art of Draperie, or Weaving and making woollen Cloth, which is esteemed at this day, one of the Butteresse which sustains the Common-wealth; and certainly for making durable Broad clothes with very good Mixtures and perfect Colours, <HI>Cranebrook</HI> doth with the most that way excell.</P>
<P>The first place of note in it, which obviates the eye, is <HI>Sisingherst;</HI> but more properly and truly written <HI>Saxenhurst;</HI> and as <HI>Bittenden,</HI> not far distant derives its Name from the <HI>Brittons,</HI> so in most probability did this take and assume its Denomination from the <HI>Saxons.</HI> In <HI>Testa de Nevil,</HI> a Book kept in the Exchequer, which is a memorial of those who holding their Lands in the Knights Service paid relief in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> third, towards the Marriage of the Kings Sister. There is mention of <HI>John de Saxenhurst</HI> who was taxed for his Lands here at <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> which certain∣ly was this <HI>Sisingherst,</HI> with the two little Mannors of <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone;</HI> which had al∣wayes the same Owners with <HI>Sisingherst:</HI> In times of a more modern Character, the <HI>Berhams</HI> by the Female Heirs of <HI>Saxenhurst</HI> were Lords of <HI>Sisingherst,</HI> with its two adjuncts <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone; Richard de Berham</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the forty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third was here resident, and is written of this place; and <HI>Henry de Berham</HI> this mans Father paid respective Aid at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, for sundry parcels of Land which he held in <HI>Kent,</HI> and amongst the rest, for his Lands at <HI>Cranebrook;</HI> and in this Family was the possession of this place, with that of <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone</HI> concentered till the lat∣ter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then part of <HI>Sisingherst</HI> with <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone</HI> was sold to Mr. <HI>Tho. Baker</HI> Father to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Attorney General, and of the Privy Counsel to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and likewise Chancellor of the Exchequer, and under-Trea∣surer, who purchased the residue, and raised that Magnificent Pile within the Park, which now charmes with so much Delight the eyes of the Spectators; and from this man by the channel of paternal and lineal Descent is the Inheritance of <HI>Sising∣herst, Copton,</HI> and <HI>Stone,</HI> emptied into Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Glastenbury</HI> is not to be forgotten, since it is of so great a Name elsewhere, and is called as the other is from <HI>Glastney</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> Idiome of <HI>Inis Witrin,</HI> the Watry or Glassie place. The House which stands in a Park is moated about, and hath been for many Generations the capital Mansion of the ancient Family of <HI>Rokchurst,</HI> ever since <HI>Stephen Rokehurst</HI> or <HI>Roberts</HI> of <HI>Curtesden,</HI> and in old Records sometimes written <HI>Rokehurst Den</HI> in <HI>Goudherst,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth married <HI>Joan</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>William Tilley</HI> of <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> (whose Ancestors had flourished at this place, as private Evidencs instruct me, ever since the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first) and in right of that Alliance became Lord of this Mansion. This <HI>Stephen Roberts, aliàs Rokehurst,</HI> was Grand-child of <HI>William Roberts, aliàs Rokehurst,</HI> and that <HI>William</HI> was great Grand-child of <HI>William de Rokehurst,</HI> who in the reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conque∣rour, as the Evidences of this Family inform me, came out of <HI>Anandale</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> in∣to
<PB N="99" REF="56"/><HI>England;</HI> and to preserve the memory of this man, did the Family till the Govern∣ment of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, write <HI>Roberts alias Rokchurst,</HI> till in the East window of the North Chancel of the Church of <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> which was built by <HI>Walur Roberts</HI> Esq; in that Princes Reign, as also in most of his Deeds and Conveyences the <HI>alias</HI> was left out.</P>
<P><HI>Coursehorne</HI> finds place to be remembred in the Map of <HI>Kent,</HI> and then must not be forgotten here; it hath been for above three hundred years (as appears by private Records) the Inheritance of <HI>Henley,</HI> in an Escheat Roll taken in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and marked with the number 92. After the death of <HI>Richard Haudloe,</HI> who it seems had Lands at <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> there is mention of one <HI>Gerva; Henley</HI> that was one of the Jury and concerned in the Inquisition: But that which much improves the Fame of this Mansion, is, that it was the Cradle of Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Serjeant at Law, a man of eminent repute in this County in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and by his three Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> married to ....... <HI>Waller</HI> of <HI>Grome-bridge, Hellen</HI> first matched to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgbury,</HI> secondly to Sir <HI>George Somersett,</HI> and thirdly to <HI>Thomas Vane</HI> of <HI>Burston;</HI> and lastly <HI>Ann</HI> wedded to <HI>Richard Covert</HI> of <HI>Slaugham</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> knit those Noble Families together in one Alli∣ance, but <HI>Coursehorne</HI> did by Descent come over to his Brother <HI>Gervas Henley</HI> Esquire, from whom Sir <HI>Thomas Henley</HI> now of <HI>Coursehorne</HI> is lineally extracted.</P>
<P>Another ancient place there is in <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> called <HI>Hartridge,</HI> the possession in times past of a worthy Family of that Sirname, among them chiefly to be remembred is <HI>Thomas Hartridge,</HI> for he was one of the Conservators or Justices of Peace in this County in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, when there was but eight only in the whole Shire. It hath been since much honoured by the <HI>Will fords,</HI> who by <HI>James Willsford</HI> a most worthy Senator of <HI>London,</HI> derive themselves from the right ancient Family of <HI>Willsford</HI> of <HI>Willsford</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and are fairly spread from hence into many Branches both in this County, and elsewhere; and after it had thus for divers Descents been resident in this noble Family, the Possession was in our Fathers remem∣brance united by purchase to the Patrimony of <HI>Tindall,</HI> now of <HI>Sutton Valence.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly <HI>Betenham</HI> is not to be passed over in silence, which is a Note worthy Place in this Parish, that gave both Seat and Sirname to the <HI>Betenhams,</HI> but when the eldest Line had only three Daughters and Coheirs, matched to <HI>More, Dering,</HI> and <HI>Fisher,</HI> who divided the Patrimony, this in his Wifes right was annexed to the Demeasn of <HI>More,</HI> and this after <HI>More</HI> had alienated his Interest in it, came to acknowledge for Sole Owners the <HI>Roes,</HI> of which Family was the right Noble Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> Knight, Chan∣cellor of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and of the Privy Councel to the late Kidg <HI>Charles,</HI> and severall years Embassador to the Great <HI>Mogor,</HI> Great <HI>Turk,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and lastly to the Princes of the Protestant Union in <HI>Germany,</HI> in the year 1642. After which Negotiation most prudently transfacted, he returned, and died; but in this Family it remained not long, for in the remembrance of that Age our Fathers lived in, it was by Sale demised to <HI>Mansfield,</HI> in whom the Possession is at this pre∣sent setled.</P>
<P>There are two places more which may be registred in this Inventorie. The first is <HI>Plechinghurst,</HI> which was an ancient Seat belonging to the <HI>Sharpeighs</HI> of <HI>Sharpeigh,</HI> a Family of deep rooted Antiquitie in this Track; <HI>Robert de Sharpeigh</HI> flourished here at <HI>Cranebrook</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and was witness to a Deed of <HI>William de Brindens</HI> of <HI>Brinden:</HI> In this Parish formerly the <HI>Linds,</HI> and now the <HI>Hol∣dens;</HI> but this Deed is without Date: another <HI>Robert Sharpeigh</HI> of <HI>Sharpeigh</HI> and <HI>Crane∣brook,</HI> as I find by an ancient Roll was in Commission as Justice of the Peace about the latter end of the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh: But as all sublunary things are crushed and overturned by the wheel of an inconstant Vicissitude, so by Conse∣quence are our Possessions likewise; for, after this place had been for so many Descents the Inheritance of this ancient Family, it was almost within the Verge of our Re∣membrance, first alienated to <HI>Martin,</HI> and by him not long since by Sale de∣mised to <HI>Walter.</HI></P>
<P>The second is <HI>Buckhurst,</HI> which is the last place of Account within the circuit of this Parish. If we go to trace the Antiquity of thse Families, who were the ancient Proprietorrs of it, we shall find that it acknowledged <HI>Hadloe</HI> and <HI>Buckhurst</HI> for its elder
<PB N="100" REF="57"/>Possessors, that the first had some concernment here, not only the private Deeds and Muniments of this place do evince to us, but likewise by an Inquisition taken after the decease of <HI>Richard de Hadloe,</HI> by which it is evident he held some Estate here in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 32. And that the second Family had some Interest here, not only the Authority abovesaid doth justifie, but the Name it self doth tacitly insinuate that this Mansion formerly gave Seat and De∣nomination to the Family of <HI>Buckhurst;</HI> in times of a lower step, that is, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Drayner;</HI> but how it devolved to this Family, I cannot discover; It is enough that it continued united to their Dimeasn, untill the beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to <HI>Alexander Coach∣man,</HI> in whose Descendant the Signorie and Interest of it hath ever since been con∣stantly resident.</P>
<P><HI>Cranebroke</HI> had the Grant of a Market to be observed weekly there on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears <HI>Cart. Edw.</HI> 1. <HI>Num.</HI> 92.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to tell you that there is a place in this Parish called <HI>Holden,</HI> which with <HI>Hawkeridge</HI> hath for some Centuries of years acknowledged the <HI>Holdens</HI> for its Proprietaries, and are still united to the Patrimony of this Name and Family, which for such a vast Succession of time hath been planted at <HI>Cranebroke.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Chappell at a place called <HI>Milkhouse,</HI> in the Eastern part of this Parish founded and endowed by <HI>John Lawless,</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, which upon the generall Dissolation of Chantries and all other Religious Fraternities by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was by that Prince about the latter end of his Rule granted to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisingherst</HI> not far distant, whose Revenue is yet in the possession of Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> his Successor.</P>
<P>There was another Chappell founded at <HI>Sisingherst</HI> (as the Evidences of that place do insinuate) by <HI>John de Saxenhurst;</HI> which was reedified by the late Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> and by a Deed delivered to <HI>John Bancroft</HI> Bishop of <HI>Oxford</HI> devoted to the Service of God, and dedicated as it was before to St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangelist:</HI> After the reception of this Instrument, which was in the year 1637. it was by the same Bishop Consecrated; first, by a Prayer at the entrance of the Chappell, then by others made at the Seats, Pulpit, and Communion Table; the effect of all which was, that God would accept of it for a House, and likewise of the Prayers and Devotions that in that Oratorie were offered up by the faithful People of God to his Honour and Service.</P>
<P><HI>Charing</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calehill,</HI> is in <HI>Saxon</HI> written <HI>Cering,</HI> and by that Name King <HI>Kenulf</HI> in the year 799. made Restitution of it to <HI>Christ Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> at the humble request of Arch-Bishop <HI>Athelard,</HI> for King <HI>Offa</HI> had taken it away from that Church in the time of Arch-Bishop <HI>Janibert;</HI> and being thus regained to the See, it continued so till the great Exchange made in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth with that Prince by Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer;</HI> the Fee-simple was planted in the Crown: In the time of the Conquest in the Notitia of the Arch-Bishop and Cathe∣drals Lands, because they held it in ancient Demeasn (that is, they had possest it long before the Conquest) and a Mannor-house or Palace there, it was called <HI>Proprium Manerium Archiepiscopi.</HI> In the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor it went for eight Sul∣lings or Plough-Lands, but in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour it was rated in <HI>Domsday</HI> Book at seven Sullings, because one Plough-Land was laid into his Demeasn. The Church dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> was anciently famous by a tra∣ditional relation, (which I am not much moved with, for it wants the stamp of venera∣ble Authority) which did affirm, that the Block on which St. <HI>John</HI> the Baptists Head was cut off, was brought into <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the first, and kept in this Church.</P>
<P>The first place of secular Interest which doth occurre, is <HI>Pett,</HI> the Evidences of this place now in the hands of Sir <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> do mention the <HI>Petts</HI> to be in Ages of a very high Assent, that is, about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first, Proprietaries of it but publick Records reach no farther than <HI>Newcourt</HI> Lord of the Mannor of <HI>Newcourt</HI> not far distant; <HI>Jeffrey de Newcourt</HI> Son of <HI>Walter de Newcourt</HI> paid respective Aid in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third for his Lands at <HI>New∣court</HI> and <HI>Pett.</HI> After the <HI>Newcourts</HI> were gone out, the <HI>Hatches</HI> were by Purchase
<PB N="101" REF="57"/>planted at <HI>Pett</HI> and <HI>Newcourt;</HI> they were called so from their abode near some Gate or passage, for one of them who was Possessor of these two places, was written <HI>Hugh at Hatch;</HI> from this Family by Sale about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, the right of <HI>Pett</HI> and <HI>Newcourt</HI> devolved to <HI>William Warham;</HI> and in some Copies of Fines which I have seen by a false Transcription written <HI>William VVarren,</HI> and this man sold them both again in the entrance of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to <HI>Robert Atwater,</HI> who determining in <HI>Mary Atwater</HI> his Sole Heir, She by matching with <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> Esquire of <HI>Henewood</HI> in <HI>Postling,</HI> wound up the Interest of these two places <HI>Pett</HI> and <HI>Newcourt</HI> into the Demeasn of that Family, so that they now own Sir <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> his great Grandchild the Sole Proprietary of them.</P>
<P><HI>Stilley</HI> is another little Mannor lying within <HI>Charing,</HI> and was anciently enwrapt in the Revenue of <HI>Frene, John de Frene</HI> who flourished in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, is mentioned in <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> a Book collected in the twentieth year of that Prince, to have paid Aid at the Marriage of the Kings Sider, for Lands which he possest at <HI>Charing;</HI> after in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, there is a recital in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> of Sir <HI>Thomas de Brockhull</HI> Son of Sir <HI>William de Brockhull,</HI> who paid an Auxiliary supply at the making of the Black Prince Knight for his Lands which he held at <HI>Saltwood, Calehill, Charing,</HI> and other places in this County; but after this the Possession was not long resident in this Family, for <HI>Henry Brockhull</HI> this mans second Son, to whom these Mannors of <HI>Stilley</HI> and <HI>Newland</HI> were assigned for livelyhood, about the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, transmitted them by Sale to <HI>John Darell</HI> Esquire, Son of Sir <HI>William Darell,</HI> who was extracted out of the right ancient and Knightly Family of the <HI>Darells</HI> of <HI>Sesay;</HI> from whom Sir <HI>John Darell</HI> of <HI>Calehill,</HI> and Lord of this Mannor of <HI>Stilley,</HI> is originally and lineally issued out.</P>
<P><HI>Wickins</HI> is another Mannor circumscribed within the Limits of this Parish, it was originally the Patrimony of <HI>Brent,</HI> a Family well endowed in this Track, and cer∣tainly was as ancient a Seat of this Family as any which lay involved in their Re∣venue, for <HI>John Brent</HI> Son of <HI>Robert de Brent</HI> of <HI>Charing</HI> paid respective Aid for Lands which he held here in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>William Brent</HI> who was Son of <HI>Hugh Brent</HI> of <HI>Charing,</HI> made his Will the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and disposed of this place to his Son <HI>Hugh Brent;</HI> and this <HI>Hugh</HI> had Issue <HI>William Brent,</HI> who composed his Testament in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; and this <HI>William</HI> was great Grandfather to <HI>Thomas Brent,</HI> in whom the Male Line determined, so that <HI>Margaret</HI> his Sister became his Sole Heir, who by matching with <HI>Jo. Dering</HI> of <HI>Surrenden Dering</HI> Esquire, hath made <HI>Wickins</HI> ever since parcel of the Demeasn of that Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Newland</HI> is another eminent Mannor in <HI>Charing,</HI> which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so styled: Sir <HI>John de Newland</HI> lived here in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and sealed with an <HI>Escollop</HI> upon a <HI>Cheveron</HI> for his Coat, which is yet visible in ancient Registers, and other venerable Monuments of Antiquity; but before the latrer end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was extinguished at this place, and then it became parcel of the noble Family of <HI>Brockhull</HI> of <HI>Cale-Hill,</HI> and continued folded up in their Possession untill the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was passed away by Deed from <HI>Henry Brockhull</HI> to <HI>John Darrell</HI> Esquire, from whom it is by successive Devolution now transported to his Successor Sir <HI>John Darrell</HI> of <HI>Cale-Hill</HI> Knight.</P>
<P><HI>Eversley</HI> next courts us to a Remembrance, it lies partly in <HI>Charing,</HI> and partly in <HI>Stacefield,</HI> and though now obscure, yet in elder times was made eminent by being one of the Mansions of <HI>Brian de Eversley,</HI> a Man very eminent in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third and <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and is mentioned in the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Feversham,</HI> to have been a Benefactor to that Covent; but his Piety could not secure the Title to his Posterity, for about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find it planted in the Pos∣fession of <HI>Peiferer,</HI> by the Heir General of which Family called <HI>Julian,</HI> it came to be the Possession of <HI>Thomas St. Leger,</HI> and he died possest of it in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and bequeathed it to <HI>Mary</HI> his Daughter and Coheir, espoused to <HI>Henry Aucher,</HI> from whom it was wafted down by descendant Right to his Successor Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> who about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> alienated it to
<PB N="102" REF="58"/><HI>Michael Sond;</HI> Esquire, afterwards created Sir <HI>Michael Sonds,</HI> from whom it is now de∣volved to his Descendant Sir <HI>George Sonds</HI> Knight of the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tremhatch</HI> in old Deeds <HI>Tramhatch,</HI> lies likewise in <HI>Charing,</HI> and is advanced and ascended to some Note and Estimate, since it was honoured by being parcel of the Patrimony of <HI>Barham,</HI> a Family which was made splendid by an eminent Repute, and no less considerable by a spreading Revenue which they held in this County, of whom I shall speak more when I come to <HI>Barham Court</HI> in <HI>Terstan,</HI> one of the prin∣cipal Mansions of this Name: Finally, after it had for several Descents confessed the Propriety of this Family, it was by <HI>Richard Barham</HI> conveyed by a Fine levied the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth to <HI>John Haut,</HI> where the Title was not so fixed as in the former, for he not long after by a semblable Alteration passed it away to <HI>Henry Malmains,</HI> and who about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, whereof was <HI>Agnes</HI> wedded to <HI>Thomas Gouldwell,</HI> and so by this Alliance <HI>Tremhatch</HI> was enwrapped in his Patrimony, and continued in the Descendants of this Name untill the forty second year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was alie∣nated by <HI>John Gouldwell</HI> and <HI>Cicely</HI> his Wife to <HI>Robert Gaunt,</HI> whose Son <HI>Thomas Gaunt</HI> died possest of it 1625, and gives it first to his Brother <HI>George Gaunt,</HI> and in De∣failance of Issue to <HI>Thomas Carlisle,</HI> who in Right of the premises is now invested in the Possession.</P>
<P><HI>Broughton</HI> is a Mannor which is likewise circumscribed within the Limits of <HI>Charing,</HI> and had Owners likewise of that Sirname. <HI>Adam de Broughton</HI> and some∣times written <HI>Brocton,</HI> flourished here about the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and his Descendants enjoyed the Proprietie of it untill the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was alienated to <HI>Paunsherst, Thomas Paunsherst</HI> made his Will in the year of our Lord 1472, and gave it to <HI>Thomas Paunsherst</HI> his Son, and he made his Will in the year 1503, and disposed of it to his Daughter <HI>Joan Paunsherst,</HI> and in Defailance of her Issue, to his Kinsman <HI>Thomas Paine;</HI> She deceased without Issue, and so the Remainder devolved to be the Inheritance of <HI>Paine,</HI> in which Name it remained untill times of our remembrance, and then it was alienated to the Father of the in∣stant Proprietary, <HI>Withick.</HI></P>
<P>Here was a <HI>Chauntry</HI> at <HI>Charing</HI> founded, as an ancient Survey of this Parish in∣structs me, by Sir <HI>Iohn Burley,</HI> who bare Quarterly <HI>Or</HI> and <HI>Sables,</HI> and was called suc∣cessively <HI>Burley</HI>'s <HI>Chauntry</HI> the Duty enjoyned the Priest that was to officiate, was to pray for the Soules of Sir <HI>Iohn Burley,</HI> Sir <HI>William de Burleigh,</HI> and the Descendants of that Family, the Demeasn which was to support it, was upon the suppression granted to Sir <HI>Io. Darell</HI> Ancestor to Sir <HI>Iohn Darell</HI> of <HI>Cale-Hill,</HI> who now is in the Enjoyment of it.</P>
<P><HI>Acton</HI> is the laft place of Account in <HI>Charing,</HI> which is eminent in respect of that relation it had to the ancient and noble Family of <HI>Beaufits,</HI> who made it their Seat before they were transplanted to <HI>Twidal</HI> in <HI>Gillingham. Robert Beaufits,</HI> as appears by an ancient Court Roll held it in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and from him did it descend to his Grandchild <HI>Robert Beaufits,</HI> who about the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, planted himself at <HI>Twidal:</HI> but yet this still continued in the Name untill the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then this Name expiring in Daughters and Co∣heirs, one of them called <HI>Ioan</HI> by matching with <HI>Robert Arnold</HI> made it the Pro∣priety of that Family, and he had Issue <HI>William Arnold,</HI> who conveyed it about the the middle of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to Sir <HI>Anthony Sonds,</HI> whose Grandchild Sir <HI>Richard Sonds</HI> in our Fathers remembrance alienated it to <HI>Hutchins,</HI> from whom by the Hands of Mr. <HI>Nicholas Nicholson,</HI> who was made his Feoffee in Trust to discharge Debts and Legacies, it is now come over to <HI>Godden.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chartham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bredge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> is a Mannor belonging to the Sea of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but of whose Donation I know not; onely <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book repre∣sents it thus appraised, <HI>Certeham est Manerium de vestitu Monachorum, &amp; T. E. R. de∣fondebat se pro IIII Sullings, &amp; nunc similiter, &amp; est appretiatur XX &amp; V</HI> <ABBR>lb.</ABBR></P>
<P>Having done with <HI>Chartham,</HI> I shall now discover what places are enclosed within the Verge of it, which were alwayes of temporal Interest.</P>
<P><HI>Densted</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Chartham,</HI> which in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="58"/>the third was held by <HI>John</HI> the Son of Sir <HI>John Polre</HI> of <HI>Polre</HI> in <HI>Harbledowne,</HI> but onely as Lessee to the Priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> to which Covent it was given by <HI>Hamon de Crevequer</HI> about the forty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>pro salute Animae suae &amp; Antecessorum suorum,</HI> says an old Note extracted out of the <HI>Coucher</HI> Book of the Prioty; yet the whole Mannor did not accrue to this Cloister by the former Donation, for in the eighth year of <HI>Rich.</HI> the second, <HI>Rob. Bovehatch,</HI> as appears, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 81. being convicted of Felony, was found to have held some Land here at <HI>Densted,</HI> which upon the Forfeiture, was by that Prince, it is probable, as was customary in those times, settled on the Prio∣ry of <HI>Leeds,</HI> and lay wholly couched in their Revenue until the publick Dissolution in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth rent it off, and then it was in the thirty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted to <HI>John Tufton</HI> Esquire, and he about the third year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the sixth alienated it to <HI>Richard Argal</HI> Esquire; from whom not long after it came over by Sale to Mr. <HI>Bartholomew Man,</HI> and he about the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> conveyed it by Sale to <HI>William Lovelace</HI> Esquire, Serjeant at Law to that Princess; and his Son Sir <HI>Will. Lovelace,</HI> about the Beginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> passed it away to to Sir <HI>Will. Cullimore,</HI> whose Lady not long after conveyed it to <HI>Tho. Steed</HI> of <HI>Steed-Hill,</HI> and he not many years since demised it to Sir <HI>Tho. Swan</HI> of <HI>Southfleet,</HI> whose Son and Heir <HI>William Swan</HI> Esquire enjoys the instant Signorie of it.</P>
<P><HI>Howfield</HI> is a second place which calls for our Notice, it was as high as any Evidence can furnish me with Intelligence, to steer me on to any old Discovery, the Patrimonial Inheritance of <HI>Fogge,</HI> a noble and Knightly Family as any in this Track: Sir <HI>Thomas Fogge</HI> who inhabited at <HI>Toniford,</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, purchased this and <HI>Toniford</HI> of <HI>John de Toniford,</HI> about the last year of that Princes Rule, and in the Revenue of this Family did the Title of this Mannor for many Descents lye rol∣led up, till some few Generations since it was alienated to <HI>Colepeper,</HI> where after some short residence, the Possession by the same Fate was transplanted into <HI>Vane,</HI> from whom not many years since it went away by Sale to Sir <HI>Will. Man</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See more of this Fa∣mily of <HI>Man</HI> at <HI>Bredgar.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who is the instant Proprietary of it.</P>
<P>But the place in <HI>Chartham</HI> of most eminent Account is the Mannor of <HI>Shalmesford-Bridge,</HI> so called because the Mansion House is situated near the <HI>Bridge,</HI> which crosses the Stoure. It was for many Generations the Inheritance of a Family which had here their Seat, and derived from hence their Sirname, and continued down in an un∣interrupted succession in the Possession of this Family, until about the beginning of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, (as appears by the Deed which I have seen) <HI>Ann</HI> Daughter and Sole Heir of <HI>William Shalmesford</HI> was wedded to <HI>John Petit,</HI> and so by this Alliance the Fee-simple of this place was lincked to their Patrimony; but in our Fathers Memory the Tie was broken, for <HI>William Petit</HI> this Mans Successor de∣ceased without Issue Male, and left onely three Daughters his Coheirs, <HI>Katharine</HI> married to <HI>Michael Belke, Elizabeth</HI> matched to <HI>Giles Masters,</HI> and lastly <HI>Dorothy</HI> espoused first to <HI>William Masters,</HI> secondly to <HI>John Meriwether,</HI> and thirdly to ...... <HI>Parker</HI> of <HI>North-Fleet,</HI> who shared his Revenue; but this upon the separation of the Estate, did improve the Demeasn of <HI>Michael Belke</HI> with its accession, from whom it is descended to the present owner Mr. ....... <HI>Belke,</HI> now Vicar of <HI>Wye,</HI> issued out from the <HI>Belkes</HI> of <HI>Coperham</HI>'s <HI>Sole</HI> in <HI>Shelvich,</HI> which hath been in the Tenure and Pos∣session, as it now is, of this Name and Family, as the private Evidences of the place do manifest, almost four hundred years.</P>
<P>There is yet another petty Mannor in <HI>Chartham</HI> called <HI>Shalmesford Street,</HI> but more truly and originally the Mansion of <HI>Bolles,</HI> for it was the Interest of that Name and Fa∣mily who had large Possessions at <HI>Chilham</HI> and the parts adjacent, but upon my view∣ing the private Evidences of this place, some of which reached to <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, I could not discover that any of them were ever represented under the notion of Gentlemen, or that there was any Coat of Arms insculped on their Seats, after <HI>Bolles</HI> was worn out, which was about the beginning of the reign of Q, <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Possession was by Sale surren∣dred to <HI>Cracknal,</HI> from whom in that Age which bordered upon our remembrance, it was by the same Fatality conveyed away to <HI>Michel,</HI> who claims the present Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Chetham</HI> with <HI>Gillingham</HI> are knit into one Hundred, so that it gives Name to that Track wherein it is situared; it was in Ages of a very high Pedigree, the Seat of the Potent, Ancient, and Illustrious Family of <HI>Crevequer,</HI> and was <HI>Caput Baroniae,</HI> or the

<P><HI>Goldwell</HI> is an ancient Mannor and Mansion in this Parish, which was for many Ages and Descents the Inheritance of the noble and illustrious Family of <HI>Goldwell,</HI> which in Times of an elder Aspect, gave them both Seat and Sirname, out of which two learned Bishops descended, <HI>Jam.

<P><HI>Chelmington</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish which gave Sirname to a generous Family, who I believe had here their Mansion too, though by the repeated and suc∣cessive Impressions of Age it be now enter'd in Rubbish and Oblivion; finally, after this place had for many Descents been wrapt up in the Revenue of this Name and Fa∣mily, it devolved at last to <HI>John Chelmington,</HI> whose Effigies is represented to us in one of the Church windows by an armed Portraicture, who deceased in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth without Issue Male, so that <HI>Eliz. Chelmington</HI> was his Daughter and Heir, who by matching with <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esq; cast it into the Patrimony of that noble and ancient Family, in respect of which original Alliance the right of this Mannor is now fixed in Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Knight and Baronet, a person to whom for his learned Conduct of these my imperfect Labours thorough the gloomy and perplexed paths of Antiquity, and the many Difficulties that did assault me, I am signally oblieged.</P>
<P><HI>Little Chart</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Calchill,</HI> and does involve that place within the Precincts and Circumference of it, which gives Denomination to the whole Hun∣dred; It was restored to the Monks of <HI>Christ Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> by <HI>Kenulfe</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> at the request of Arch-Bishop <HI>Athelard</HI> or <HI>Atheldred,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 799. for King <HI>Offa</HI> had before violently torn it off from the Patrimony of the Church, as appears by that ancient Record called the Book of <HI>Christ Church.</HI> In the year 1044, one <HI>Elleric Bigge</HI> confirmed this Donation, and it went then as it had done before by Assignation towards the supply of their Diet; And the Notitia of the particular Mannors belonging to <HI>Christ Christ</HI> in the <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Record speaks

<P><HI>Calehill</HI> is that eminent Mannor in <HI>Little Chart</HI> which gives Name to the whole Hundred, it was under the Scepter of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Inheritance of a good Fami∣ly called <HI>Frene,</HI> who (as appears by Seals and other Authentick Records of Armorie) bare for their paternal Coat <HI>Or</HI> a <HI>Flower de Lis</HI> within a plain Bordure <HI>Sables,</HI> in Allu∣fion and Assimulation to that <HI>Pluckly,</HI> of whom it is probable they held some Land in this Track, who bore <HI>Or</HI> only a <HI>Flower de Lis Sabler; Hugh de Frene</HI> in the first year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the first, obtained a Charter of Free Warren to his Mannor of <HI>Calehill</HI> and <HI>Stilley</HI> in <HI>Charing:</HI> But before the middle of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, this Family was departed from the Possession of this place, having surrendred the Propriety of it, and <HI>Stilley</HI> in <HI>Charing</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Brockhull</HI> second Son of Sir <HI>William Brockhull,</HI> and he paid respective Aid for his Mannor of <HI>Calehill,</HI> and his Lands at <HI>Charing,</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight; <HI>Thomas Brockhull</HI> his Son was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the seventh and eighth years of <HI>Rich.</HI> the second, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Calehill,</HI> and he had Issue <HI>Hen.

<P><HI>Burleigh</HI> is another Mannor, partly in this Parish, and partly in <HI>Charing,</HI> which had anciently Owners who bore that Sirname, and there is a place in <HI>Charing</HI> Church, which at this Day is known by the Name of <HI>Burleighs</HI> Chauntry, which is very pro∣bable was founded by them; after the <HI>Burleighs</HI> were extinguished and abstracted from the Possession of this place, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the <HI>St. Johns</HI> written in Sir <HI>John Darells</HI> Latin Deeds <HI>De Sancto Johanne,</HI> became Lords of the Fee; but long this Mannor was not refident in them, for before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family of <HI>St. John</HI> was crumbled into Decay and Oblivion, and having disloged from the Possession, a Family called <HI>Dalingryg</HI> of eminent Note in

<P><HI>Chart Sutton</HI> sometimes called <HI>Chart Greene,</HI> is seated in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne;</HI> within the Confines of this Parish there is an ancient Mannor and Mansion called <HI>Norton place,</HI> it gave Name to as ancient a Family as any in this Track, in the South-Windows of the Church there was the Effigies of <HI>Stephen Norton,</HI> with his Arms on his Tabard or Surcoat, <HI>viz. Argent</HI> a <HI>Cheveron</HI> between three <HI>Crescents Azure,</HI> who flourished in King <HI>Richard</HI> the seconds Time; and in a Turnament of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, I find one of this Name in a Tabard of the Arms above mentioned, encountring one <HI>Christmasse</HI> of <HI>East Sutton</HI> not far distant, who was in like manner so habited in a Surcoat charged with his Arms, which meetly express the Owners name, <HI>viz. Gules</HI> upon a <HI>Bend Sables</HI> three <HI>Wassail Bowls Or,</HI> which likewise stand in the South∣Windows in <HI>Sutton</HI> Church. But the Effects of <HI>Gavelkind</HI> did at length grind this Family to a small Remain, so that in the Times which did almost border upon those our Fathers lived in, this Seat was by <HI>Norton</HI> sold to <HI>Baker,</HI> from whom by the same Fatality not long after it went away to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Grandfather to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Baronet, who is the present Proprietary of it. But though the Family be worn out at this place, yet from a Cadet of this Name, who did once possess <HI>Wierton</HI> in <HI>Boughton Quarry,</HI> now the Mansion of Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> did Sir <HI>Gregory Nor∣ton</HI> now of <HI>Sussex</HI> Knight and Baronet lately deceased originally sprout forth.</P>
<P>There is another place in this Parish called the Den of <HI>Ivetegh,</HI> which was anci∣ently the Inheritance of a Family who bore that Name, and though the Deeds now in the Hands of my Cozen Mr. <HI>Thomas Petley</HI> of <HI>Vilston,</HI> do discover the Possession to be resident in this Name, no higher then the Rule of <HI>Henry</HI> the fixth, yet it is probable, because the Name was local it was theirs long beyond that Time; from <HI>Ivetegh</HI> it came to <HI>Mascall,</HI> a Family whose Estate was formerly at <HI>Berming,</HI> and from this Name it was by Sale demised to <HI>Lambe,</HI> who some three descents since alienated his Interest in it to <HI>Perry,</HI> extracted from the <HI>Perrys</HI> of <HI>Worcestershire;</HI> but this Family lately de∣termining in Females, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> marryed to Mr. <HI>Thomas Petley</HI> of <HI>Vilston, Ann,</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> these three are the Vihble Coheits of that Estate which related to it.</P>

<P><HI>Newbery</HI> is the second place of Account, which was in elder Times ennobled by

<P><HI>Nin-House</HI> shall not pass without some mention, because it was the residence of <HI>John at Nin,</HI> who is in the Register of those twelve Worthies who are pourtraied kneeling in Coat Armour in an ancient window in this Parish Church; whose posteritie enjoyed it untill the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Sharpe,</HI> and <HI>Wil.

<P><HI>Chevening</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Codsheath,</HI> had owners of that Name, in times of higher Assent, who were of no dispicable account. <HI>Adam de Chevening</HI> was one of the grand Assise in the time of King <HI>John,</HI> and had his residence here, and likewise derived his Name from hence; and the heirs of <HI>William de Chevening</HI> paid respective Aid for the Mannor of <HI>Chevening</HI> by the half part of a Knights Fee, (which <HI>Adam de Chevening</HI> formerly held of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>) in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight; when the <HI>Cheve∣nings</HI> went away from the Possession of this place, the Family of <HI>Delapole,</HI> who were Lords of the Mannor of <HI>Pool</HI> in <HI>Southfleet,</HI> were Seated in the Inheritance, for <HI>John de Lapole</HI> held it in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; but long after this did it not continue constant to this Name, for by Sale the whole Demise was put into the Tenure of <HI>Isley,</HI> and <HI>William Isley</HI> held it at his death, which was in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Chepsted</HI> in this Parish, was so called from the Market of Fish there long since used; for there such as imported fish from <HI>Rye</HI> on the Sea-Coast, thence called <HI>Rypers,</HI> made their Stage, and on fresh horses carried it to <HI>London.</HI> Just as <HI>Chepe-Side,</HI> and other places beginning with <HI>Chepe,</HI> give Addition and Distinction from other Towns of like Name where Markets are kept. That this Mannor had Proprietaries of this Name is evident, for <HI>John de Chepsted</HI> Son of <HI>Cohn de Chepsted</HI> paid respect of Aid for this Mannor which was held by Knights Service, of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight; the Heir of <HI>Chepsted</HI> (as appears by an old Pedigree in the hands of Sir <HI>Sackvil Crow</HI>) was matched to <HI>John de Bore,</HI> and the Heir of <HI>Bore</HI> to <HI>Stockett,</HI> who passed away <HI>Chepsted</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, to <HI>William Isley</HI> Esquire, whose un∣happy Successor Sir <HI>Henry Isley</HI> being attainted in the time of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> it eschea∣ted to the Crown, where it hath ever since been resident.</P>
<P><HI>Morants Court</HI> lies in <HI>Chevening</HI> likewise, and contributed both Seat and Sirname to a Knightly Family who were Proprietaries of it. King <HI>Edward</HI> the second in the fourteenth year of his Reign granted Charter-warren to <HI>Jurdan,</HI> and <HI>William de Morant</HI> in all their Lands in <HI>Chevening, Shoram, Otfood, Brasted, Sundridge,</HI> and <HI>Chiding∣ston; William de Morant</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the twelfth and thirteenth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, and had Issue Sir <HI>Thomas Morant,</HI> whose heir General brought this Seat to

<P><HI>Chiselhurst</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> hath several places within the confines of it, of signal Account. The first is <HI>Scadbery,</HI> which had Owners of that Sirname, which about the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, were extinguished; for then <HI>John de Scadbery</HI> deceased without Issue male, so that this ancient Seat devolved to be the Patrimony of <HI>Osmund de Walsingham,</HI> descended from the Knightly Family of <HI>Wal∣singham</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who matched with <HI>Ann</HI> his sole Daughter and Heir, and having planted himself in this County, he began to sprout out and flourish into a Series of such worthy Successors, that this Family was justly registred in the Catalogue of those who were esteemed the most ancient and eminent of this County, having in this latter Decursion of Time, been for six Descents Knights; which, that I may the better represent to the Reader, the Splendor of this Family I shall destinctly name; the first was Sir <HI>Thomas Walsingham,</HI> who was born the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and he had Issue Sir <HI>James Walsingham,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, whose Son and Heir was Sir <HI>Edmund Walsingham,</HI> who was Lieu∣tenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> twenty four years, and he had Issue Sir <HI>Tho.</HI> Kinsman to Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham</HI> the famous Secretary of Estate to Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Walsingham</HI> was Son and Heir of Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> above mentioned, and he had Issue Sir <HI>Thomas Walsingham,</HI> who is the instant Proprietary of <HI>Scadbery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Frogpool</HI> is another ancient Seat in this Parish, which in <HI>Henry</HI> the thirds Reign confessed the Signory of a Family called <HI>Barbur, Thomas le Barbur</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands in at <HI>Chiselhurst</HI> in the thirty eighth of the above named Prince. But before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, this Family was moldered away, and then it came to be possest by a Family called <HI>Cressell,</HI> who were Lords of much Land about <HI>Hartley, Faukham,</HI> and other places in that Territory, and bore for their Coat Armour, as appears depicted in ancient Coloured Glasse in <HI>Chiselhurst</HI> Church, <HI>Sables A Fesse Argent</HI> between three <HI>Chaplets Or; John de Cressell</HI> in an old Survey of <HI>Rochester</HI> is remembred to have been a liberall Benefactor to this Church in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and from the Government of that Prince, does the Age of the above mentioned Coat seem to commence, and this is the Reason, why another <HI>John Cressell</HI> of this Family, is in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth recorded in the Register of those, <HI>Qui portabant Arma antiqua.</HI> Finally, after the Propriety of this noted Mansion had continued so many Descents wrapped up in the Patrimo∣ny of this Family, it was about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth transmitted by Sale to <HI>Dyneley,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Dyneley</HI> in our Remembrance demised his Concernment in it to Mr. <HI>William Watkins,</HI> to whose Care and industrious Expence, the additional Building annexed to the ancient Structure, does owe its originall; and he having thus improved it, transmitted his Right in it by sale some few yeers since to Mr. <HI>Philip Warwick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Chiddingston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Somerden</HI> hath the Addition of <HI>Cohbam,</HI> as being the Inheritance of the Lords <HI>Cobham</HI> of <HI>Sterborough</HI> Castle; <HI>Henry de Cobham</HI> had in the ninth year of King <HI>John</HI> a Charter for all his Lands in <HI>Kent,</HI> of which these at <HI>Chid∣dingston</HI> with the two little Mannors of <HI>Reynsley</HI> and <HI>Tihurst:</HI> In Ages of a lower Step, <HI>Reginald</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> who was summoned to Parliament, as Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> of <HI>Sterborough</HI> in the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, died possest of them in the thirty fifth year of that Prince, <HI>Parte prima Rot.

<P><HI>Burwash</HI> Court in this Parish was the Patrimony of the Lords <HI>Burgherst,</HI> by vulgar Depravation of the Name, called <HI>Burwash; Stephen de Burwash</HI> had a Charter of Free-warren to all his Lands in <HI>Kent,</HI> in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Robert de Burgherst</HI> or <HI>Burwarsh</HI> possest it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Easture</HI> in this Parish, was the Seat of a Family which was known by that Sirname, and in several ancient Deeds, which are not bounded or limited with any Date, there is mention of <HI>John de Easture,</HI> who lived here in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third and <HI>Edward</HI> the first; after this Name was vanished, the <HI>Apul∣derfields</HI> of <HI>Otterpley</HI> in <HI>Challock,</HI> a younger Branch of the <HI>Apulderfields</HI> of <HI>Bed∣mancore,</HI> were invested in the Possession; and of this Family was <HI>Henry de Apulder∣field,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the fifty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> third, and likewise Proprietary of this place; but when this Family resolved into a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Isabell,</HI> she by matching with <HI>John Idelegh,</HI> who had a large Income about <HI>Mepham, Chalk,</HI> and <HI>Cobham,</HI> cast it into the Inheritance of that Family, where it had not long remained, but a Vicissitude like the former carryed it by <HI>Agnes</HI> the Female Heir of <HI>William Idelegh</HI> to <HI>Christopher Ellenden,</HI> who was Master of a good Estate about <HI>Seasalter</HI> and <HI>Damian Bleane,</HI> which Name not many years after shrunk into a Daughter and Heir likewise called <HI>Mary,</HI> descended from <HI>Thomas Ellenden,</HI> who was about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh matched to

<P><HI>Youngs</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Chilham,</HI> which by Deeds of a very high gradation in time, which step into the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, appears to be the Possession of a Family of that Appellation; and when that was decayed and worn out at this Place, the <HI>Beverleys</HI> who were a Family which had been planted at <HI>Tancrey</HI> Island in <HI>Fordwich</HI> ever since the latter end of the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third were ingraffed in the Inheritance, and continued by an undissolved Chain of several Ages seated in the Proprietie of it, till <HI>George Beverley</HI> the last of this Name at this place in our Grandfathers Remembrance, demised his right in it by Sale to <HI>George Barley,</HI> where the Title found no long abode, for he passed away his Interest to <HI>Fleet,</HI> extracted from the <HI>Fleets</HI> of <HI>Fleet</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Thanet,</HI> who suddenly after alienated it to <HI>Shepheard,</HI> from which Family almost in our Remembrance it was by Purchase brought over to own the Signorie of Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs,</HI> who upon his decease transmitted it to his eldest Son Mt. ....... <HI>Diggs</HI> Esquire, in whom the present Proprietie of it is fixed.</P>
<P><HI>Dane Court</HI> is a fourth Mannor within the Limits of <HI>Chilham,</HI> not to be waved or declined in this present Survey: It was anciently the Patrimony of <HI>Thomas de Gar∣winton</HI> of <HI>Welle</HI> in <HI>Littlebourne,</HI> and he held it, as appears by ancient Court Rolls, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and <HI>Edward</HI> the second, whose great Grandchild <HI>William Garwinton</HI> of <HI>Welle</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, dying without Issue, upon a serious debate and winnowing of Collateral Alliances, <HI>Joan</HI> Wife of <HI>Richard Haute</HI> was found to be his Cousin and Heir, and so this place became in her Right the Inhe∣ritance of this Family; but this mans Son called <HI>Richard,</HI> likewise not long after decea∣sing without Issue male, <HI>Margerie</HI> his only Daughter, who was matched to <HI>Will.

<P>There is a place in this Parish on the South-side of the River stretched out on a long green Hill, which the Common People (who bear the greatest sway in corrupting of Names) call <HI>Jelliberies</HI> Grave. The Historie it self will evidence the original of this de∣nomination. It was about this place that <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> respited his farther remove or ad∣vance into the bowels of this Island, upon intelligence received that his Fleet riding in the road at <HI>Lymen</HI> not far distant, had been much afflicted and shattered by a Tem∣pest; whereupon he returned, and left his Army for ten dayes, encamped upon the brow of this Hill, till he had new careen'd and rigg'd his Navy; but in his march from hence was so vigoriously encountered by the <HI>Britons,</HI> that he lost with many others <HI>Leberius Durus</HI> Tribune and Marshal of the Field, whose Obsequies being performed with solemnities answerable to the eminence of his Place, and Command, each Souldier as was then Customary, bringing a certain quantity of earth to improve his place of Sepulture into more note then ordinarie, caused it so much to exceed the proportion of others elswhere; and from hence it assumed the name of <HI>Julaber,</HI> whom other vulgar heads, ignorant of the truth of the story, have fancied to have been a Giant, and others of them have dreamed to have been some Enchanter or Witch.</P>

<P><HI>Chillenden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> gave Sirname to a Family so stiled, and there is a recital in Deeds very ancient, which extract their Original from the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, of <HI>John de Chillenden, Edward</HI> and <HI>William de Chillenden,</HI> who had an Interest in this place in Ages of a lower step; the <HI>Bakers</HI> who were Lords of <HI>Caldham</HI> by <HI>Capell,</HI> were in the Possession of this place, and after they were gone out, the Family of <HI>Hunt</HI> about the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth by Purchase were setled in the Inheritance; and here the Title for two or three Descents was Successively permanent, and then the same inconstant Revolution which carried it to <HI>Hunt,</HI> wafted it over from that Name by Sale to <HI>Gason,</HI> which Family I find to be of no despiscable Antiquitie about <HI>Ickham</HI> and that Track; and when it had for some years been linked to their Revenue, it was for some two or three Ages since alienated to <HI>Hamon,</HI> Ancestor to <HI>Anthony Hamon</HI> Esquire, into whom by original Descent, the hereditarie Right of this place is at this present collected.</P>

<P><HI>Clive</HI> formerly <HI>Cloves-Hoo,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> called so from its situ∣ation either on some elevated precipice, or else its being cloven or rent in some part of it, from the Continent by water. It was in the Conquerours time called <HI>Bishops-Clive;</HI> and in the Pages of <HI>Doomsday</HI> Book it is thus ra∣ted, <HI>Cliva est Manerium Monachorum, &amp; est de vestitu eorum &amp; in T. E. R. se defendebat pro II. Sullings &amp; Dimidio &amp; est appretiatum XVI.</HI> However the place at present may be represented obscure and despiscable, being shrunk from its former Glory, yet in those Ages wherein the <HI>Saxons</HI> flourished, it was ennobled with several Synods which were held here, both National and Provincial, wherein several Rules and Constitutions were enacted and established both to fetter up the Exorbitances of of the Clergie within the Channels and shores of the Ordinances and Decretals Ecclesiastical, and likewise to empale the Irregularities of the Laity, who then began to be debauched into disorder and excess, within the restraints and boundaries of the Laws temporal: I shall now exactly unweave them as they are Registred by the learned <HI>Spelman</HI> in his exact Collection of the Councels held before the Conquest: The first was held in the year 742. under King <HI>Ethelbald,</HI> and Arch-Bishop <HI>Cuthbert.</HI> The second under <HI>Ethelbald</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> accompanied with the principal of his Nobilitie, and Arch-Bishop <HI>Cuthbert</HI> invested with his Bishops, Abbots, and other
<PB N="119" REF="67"/>Ecclesiastical Persons, in the year 747. The third was celebrated under Arch-Bishop <HI>Athelard</HI> in the year 798. The fourth Synod or Councell was convened at this place under <HI>Kenulf</HI> King of <HI>Mercians,</HI> and <HI>Athelard</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in in the year 800. The fifth was called together under the abovesaid King <HI>Kenulf,</HI> and Arch-Bishop <HI>Athelard,</HI> in the year 803. The sixth was assembled in the third year of <HI>Bernulfe</HI> King of the <HI>Mercia,</HI> in the year 822. that Prince himself with <HI>Ʋlfred</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> being both present and president at it and over it: The result of this eminent Synod was to rescue and restore to the Patrimony of the Church-Lands called <HI>Haerghes, Hereforddinglond, Gedding</HI> and <HI>Combe;</HI> which by the Sacrilegious violence of some impious men, even in those times had been ravished away from the Ecclesiastical Demeasn. Their eighth and last was a small Synodal Convention collect∣ed into a Body under the above mentioned King <HI>Bernulf,</HI> and Arch-Bishop <HI>Ulfred,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace,</HI> 824. And it is observable, that in these Assemblies, and in other Recor∣ded by Sir <HI>Henry Spelman;</HI> either the King immediately, or else some <HI>Thane,</HI> (which was a Dignity equivalent to our <HI>English</HI> Baron;) who did Personate the Prince, was joyntly President with the Bishop; that as one took Cognisance of the Affaires of the Church, so the other managed the Concernments and Interest of the State; and this was done with much of Reason and Prudence in the original Constitution of these Synods, for the mingling the divided Interests of the Laitie, and Clergie together; and making them mutually to interfere, extinguished all jealousie and Emulation be∣tween them, and by consequence all those black effects and inconveniences, which are still the Retinue to those two Furies; for we cannot be so Citizens of the Common∣wealth, but we must be Sons of the Church; nor so Sons of the Church, (the Tempo∣rall and Spirituall Interest are so complicated together) but we must in some relation be Citizens of the Common-wealth; and what causeth annoyance to the one, creates disturbance to the other; for like <HI>Hippocrates</HI> Twins they laugh and mourn, and live and die together: But to proceed, when this Mannor had for many Ages been in∣corporated with the Inheritance of the Church, <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth judging the Clergie grown too Luxuriant in a wide Revenue, prun'd off this, and <HI>Malingden</HI> a Mannor which was ever an Appendage to <HI>Cliffe,</HI> as two superfluous Excrescencies; and engraffed them again in the Royall Demeasn; but suddenly after, <HI>Cliff</HI> was by this Prince granted to <HI>George Brooke</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and he left it to his Son Sir <HI>William Brooke</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> who enstated it by entaile on his second Son <HI>George Brooke,</HI> and in Defailance of Issue male, by him surviving, to the next Heir male of the Name; after this man was beheaded at <HI>Winchester,</HI> in the second year of King <HI>James,</HI> this devolved to his Son Sir <HI>William Brooke,</HI> who dying without Issue male, in the year 1643. Sir <HI>Jo. Brooke</HI> now Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> became his Heir.</P>
<P><HI>Malingden</HI> was by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted to <HI>William Ewens,</HI> who quickly after this Concession, transferred his Interest in it by Sale to <HI>Brown,</HI> from whom by as sudden a Decursion the Title by Purchase went in to <HI>Sompner,</HI> who (in Times which almost attaque our Remembrance,) sold it away to <HI>Hills.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perry Court</HI> in <HI>Cliffe,</HI> was always a Limb of the Revenue of the Family of <HI>Cobham,</HI> and so for many Hundred years continued, till <HI>Henry Brooke</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> being wound up in that fatal and mysterious Design of the noble but infortunate Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> in the Time of King <HI>James,</HI> forfeited this to the Crown; but this Seat was by the above∣said Prince, after the Death of <HI>Frances</HI> Widow to the abovesaid <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> granted to <HI>Robert Cecill</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> in Reversion, who married <HI>Elizabeth Brook</HI> this Lords Sister, and his Son <HI>Will.</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> Knight of the Garter, and Captain of the Band of Pentioners to his late Majesty, passed it away by Sale to <HI>Bernard Hide</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Esq; whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>Bernard Hide</HI> does enjoy the present Fee-simple of it.</P>

<P><HI>Cosmus-Damianus-Bleane</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Whitstaple,</HI> and contains three pla∣ces within the Boundaries of it, which may fall under a Survey.

Sir <HI>Richard at Leeze</HI> dyed possest of it in the year 1394. but going out without Issue, <HI>Marcellus at Leeze</HI> was his Brother and Heir, who concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Lucy</HI> first married to <HI>Jo.

Langley,</HI> releaseth all his right in this place to his Kinsman Sir <HI>Jo. Norton,</HI> and he in the third year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the sixth, passes away his Concernment in it by Sale to <HI>Tho. Green,</HI> whose Successors <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Tho. Green,</HI> in the seventh year of K. <HI>James,</HI> alienated it by mutual Concurrence to <HI>Jo.

<P>The second is <HI>Lambert</HI> Lands a Mannor which is couched partly within the Limits of <HI>Hernhill,</HI> and partly within the Verge of this Parish; It was in elder times an Appen∣dage to the revenue of <HI>Feversham</HI> Abby: but when the storm of Suppression, which hap∣pened in the Government of the reign of <HI>H.</HI> the eighth, had ravished it away from the patrimony of the Church, and lodged it in the Crown, it was by that Prince in the thirty sixth year of his reign granted to <HI>Tho. Arden;</HI> but it seems it was but for Life, for after he was Barbarously assassinated by his Wife, and her inhumane Complices in the reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> the sixth, and left no Issue; that Prince granted it to Sir <HI>Henry Crispe</HI> of <HI>Quckes,</HI> in whose posterity the title was permanent, till that Age our Fathers lived in, and then it was alienated to Sir <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Hoad-court</HI> is, and always was, part of the Demeasn of <HI>East-bridge</HI> Hospital, holding of the Master thereof. <HI>East-bridge,</HI> was formerly an Inn, for poor devout Pilgrims, who came to offer up their Visits and Orizons to the shrine of <HI>Tho.

<PB N="125" REF="70"/>and a Warden, all very plentifully provided for; he died without issue, and left his estate here to his Nephew Mr. <HI>Tho.

Bois</HI> Esq; a person who for his ingenious and candid Love to Literature may be justly said to be worthy of better times, but fit for these; that is, though his Merit should have been calculated for the best of days, yet it is made more eminent by his support of Learning in the worst.</P>
<P><HI>Cowden</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Somerden</HI> and <HI>Westerham,</HI> did anciently with its revenue, support the Colledge of <HI>Lingfield</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> till the publique dissolution came and tore it off, and then it was by <HI>H.</HI> the eighth granted to <HI>H.</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> from whom it sud∣denly after devolved by sale to <HI>Wiskenden,</HI> whose Grandchild not many years since decea∣sing, left it divided between his two Sons, one of which hath lately alienated his Moi∣ety to <HI>Ashdown,</HI> though the other proportion still continues in the Name of <HI>Wickenden.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Moat</HI> is an eminent Seat in <HI>Cowden,</HI> which for many Generations confessed the Signory of a Family called <HI>Cosin</HI> or <HI>Cosins,</HI> as is evident from several Deeds of certain parcels of Land which relate to this Mansion, as the capital messuage which were con∣veyed, some by Sale, some by resignation, from one <HI>Cosin</HI> to another. Whence this Fa∣mily was originally extracted, I cannot collect, because the evidences of this place (from which I am to borrow my Intelligence) extend no higher then this Family, yet it is probable their first Cradle was in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> where in elder times they were eminent: for in the sixteenth year of <HI>E.</HI> the second, I find one <HI>Jo. Cosin</HI> obtained License by pa∣rent to found a Chantry at <HI>Norwich,</HI> as appears <HI>Pat. Anno</HI> 16. <HI>E.</HI> 2. <HI>Parte secunda Memb.</HI> 4. but whether this Family seated here were derived from him immediately or not, is incertain. Sure I am, that after they had for many Descents been planted here, about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, it began to crumble away; for in the thirty second year of that Prince, <HI>William Cosin</HI> by Deed passed it away to <HI>William Hextall, William Gainsford</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Gainsford,</HI> in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; <HI>Hextall</HI> surrenders all his Interest here to <HI>William Gainsford</HI> Esquire, so he is written in the Deed, and from him did it descend to <HI>Nicholas Gainsford,</HI> whom I find to be Justice of the Peace for <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and from him is that Family successively branched out, who are the instant proprietaries of this place.</P>
<P><HI>Waystrode</HI> is another obscure Mannor in this Parish, which was the possession of as obscure a Family, wich bore that Sirname, who continued Lords of the Fee; untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was passed away to <HI>May,</HI> in which Name it had not been permanent untill the latter end of that Prince, but the same re∣volution conveyed it into the possession of a Family whose Sirname was <HI>Still,</HI> in whose Successors the title hath remained so constant, that the Inheritance of this place is at this instant resident in this Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Cowling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> had still the Barons <HI>Cobham,</HI> of <HI>Cobham</HI>) of whom I have discoursed so largely at that place) for possessors and came down along with them to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> who expired in <HI>Joan Cobham</HI> his Daughter and Heir, who was first espoused to <HI>John Delapole,</HI> secondly to Sir <HI>John Oldcastle,</HI> who for asser∣ting the Doctrine of the <HI>Lollards,</HI> notwithstanding his many great Atchievements in Military Commands, which rendered him gracious with his Prince, and glorious in our Chronicles, he was in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, quite subverted by a Romish Tempest raised by the Ecclesiasticks of those Times, and martyr'd in a most inhumane manner, by hanging him first, and burning his Body also; third∣ly, she was matched to <HI>Reginald Braybrook,</HI> by whom she had only <HI>Joan</HI> her Daughter and Heir, who was wedded to <HI>Thomas Brook</HI> of the County of <HI>Somer∣set</HI> Esquire; from whom descended <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Brook</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque
<PB N="126" REF="71"/>ports in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who gave this Mannor to <HI>George Brooke</HI> his second Son; and he being unhappily entangled in that mysterious Design of his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and Sir <HI>VValter Ramleigh,</HI> by the Losse of his Head at <HI>VVinchester,</HI> did expiate this unhappy undertaking; but this being setled by entail and in Marriage also upon his Son, who was in this latter Age known by the Name of Sir <HI>VVilliam Brook,</HI> was by King <HI>James</HI> restored to this person then in his Minority, upon whose Decease it descended to Sir <HI>Iohn Brook</HI> as the Heir male of the Family, who was created Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> by the late King at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cowling</HI> Castle was erected by <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> by Concession from <HI>Richard</HI> the second, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 4. <HI>Richardi secundi;</HI> which grant of his in the whole Tenor of it, he caused to be inscribed in a large Table of Stone upon the Front of the Castle: so careful was he to conform to the Laws of the Land, which had a particular Aspect upon private embattelling, a Species of Fortification, prohibited <HI>si facta fuerit sine Licen∣tia Domini Regis.</HI></P>

<P>The Mannor of <HI>Temple</HI> in this Parish, was involved in that Revenue, which was marshal'd under the Jurisdiction of the Knights <HI>Templers,</HI> as the very Name doth seem to insinuate, and upon the totall disannulling this order here in <HI>England,</HI> was, by a Statute made in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, setled on the Knights of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where it was fixed and constant, untill the disbanding of that Order likewise in this Nation by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was an∣nexed to the Patrimony of the Crown; and rested there, untill K. <HI>James</HI> exchanged it, with <HI>Robert,</HI> E. of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who sold it to <HI>Edw. Darcy</HI> Esq; whose Grandchild <HI>Edw. Darcy</HI> Esq; hath lately conveyed it by Sale, to his Brother in Law Mr. <HI>Will. Gough.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Charles</HI> is Seated in this Parish, and was a Branch of that Estate which fell under the Signorie of the ancient Family of <HI>Charles,</HI> from whom it assumed its ap∣pellation. Of this Family was <HI>Edw. Charles,</HI> who was Captain and Admiral of the <HI>Fleet,</HI> from the <HI>Thames</HI>-Mouth North-ward, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 34. <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. after this Family had left the Possession of this place which was about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; <HI>Nicholas de Brember</HI> was planted in the Proprietie: but he was scarce warm in his new atchieved Purchase, but he fell under the guilt of high Treason, only for being too fast in his Loyaltie and Faith to his Prince, and too loose in his fidelity to his Country, for there it seems that blind distinction had its first rise and growth which like some Alem∣beck distil'd and dropped the Power of the King distinguished apart from his Person, upon the forfeiture of his Life and Estate together, which was in the tenth year of <HI>Rich.</HI> the second: It was by that Prince suddenly after conveyed by grant to <HI>Adam Bamme</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London:</HI> in which Family after it had for many Ages been seated, (it was as appears by an exemplification now in the hands of Mr. <HI>Took</HI> of <HI>Dartford</HI>) transmit∣ted by Sale to <HI>Death,</HI> who about the latter end of K. <HI>James</HI> passed it away to <HI>Goldsmith</HI> of <HI>Marshals-Court</HI> in <HI>Creyford;</HI> who some few years since sold all his Concernment in it to Mr. <HI>Tooks,</HI> branched out from the ancient Family of the <HI>Tooks</HI> of <HI>Bere</HI> in <HI>West-Clive;</HI> though, since this Name setled at <HI>Dartford,</HI> it hath by Depravation been called <HI>Tuke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Horsemans-Place</HI> is a Mansion of good account likewise in <HI>Dartford;</HI> in the six∣teenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, I find it owned one <HI>Thomas de Luda</HI> for Proprieta∣rie, between whom and <HI>Thomas de Sandwich</HI> Abbot of <HI>Lessnes,</HI> there was a Composi∣tion about that time touching the passage of a Current of Water. But this Family before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, had deserted the Possession; and then (by old Court-Rolls and other Evidences) I find it in the Tenure of <HI>John Horsman,</HI> who, it is probable new built this Mansion, and on the old Foundation established this new-Name; and he had Issue <HI>Thomas Horseman,</HI> who about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, dying without Issue, gave it to his Widow <HI>Margaret Horseman,</HI> re-married to <HI>Shardelow,</HI> and she, upon her decease, in the ninteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, be∣queathed it to her Kinsman <HI>Thomas Brown,</HI> whose Daughter and Sole Heir <HI>Katherine,</HI> annexed it to the Patrimony of <HI>Robert Blague,</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and he had Issue by her <HI>Barnabie Blague,</HI> who in the thirty third of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth conveyed it by Sale to Mr. <HI>John Bere,</HI> who much adorned and augmented the ancient Shell or Structure of this Seat in the thirtieth year of that Princes Reign; but left his Acquists thus increased and improved to <HI>Ann</HI> his Sole Heir matched to Mr. <HI>Christo∣pher Twislton,</HI> descended from <HI>Twislton</HI> Castle in the County of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> whose Suc∣cessor Sir <HI>Jo. Twislton,</HI> Knight, and Baronet, is now by descendant, Right Possessor of it.</P>
<P><HI>At Stanpit,</HI> in this Parish, there was a Chappell founded by one <HI>Thomas de Dertford</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="72"/>and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, for one Priest to celebrate divine Offices for the Soul of the Founder. In this Parish, there was likewise a perpetual Salary established by one <HI>Thomas Martin</HI> to pray for the Soul of the Founder, and Light-lands which were given by <HI>John Grovehurst.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Denton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> was given to the Church of <HI>Rochester</HI> by a Noble man called <HI>Brichric</HI> and <HI>Efswith</HI> his Wife: but it seems there had been some Invasion made upon the Original grant; for (as the Book called <HI>Textus Roffensis</HI> informs me) it was restored to that Cathedral by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and was in after-times when <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, upon the Ruines of the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> raised the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Rochester,</HI> by royal Concession united to their Demeasn.</P>
<P><HI>Denton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry</HI> with the appendant Mannor of <HI>Tapington,</HI> now by Contraction called <HI>Tapton,</HI> were in Times of very ancient Inscription, both cou∣ched in the patrimony of <HI>Yerd;</HI> and though several datelesse Deeds represent this Fa∣mily to have been possessors of both these places, as high as the reign of K. <HI>Jo.</HI> and <HI>H.</HI> the third: yet the first of this Name, whom Record discovers to us, to have been e∣minent, was <HI>John de Yerd</HI> who held the Mannors of <HI>Denton</HI> and <HI>Tapington,</HI> by that Service which they call <HI>ad Wardam Castri Doveriensis,</HI> and paid a respective Supply for them, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black-Prince Knight, and from this man did the possession of both these places flow down to <HI>Jo. Yerd</HI> Esq; who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the nineteenth of <HI>Hen.</HI> the sixth, and he had Issue <HI>John Yerd,</HI> who conveyed <HI>Tapington</HI> to <HI>Jo. Fogge</HI> Esq; and he again by a Fine levyed in the fifteenth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the fourth, passed away his Interest in it to <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> and he determined in a Female Heir called <HI>Margery Haut,</HI> matched to <HI>William Isaack,</HI> who annexed <HI>Tap∣ton</HI> to his Demeasn, and in his descendant line the propriety remained untill that Age which was enclosed within the Circle of our Grand-fathers remembrance, and then it was alienated to <HI>Bois.</HI> But <HI>Denton</HI> with some part of the revenue of <HI>Tapington,</HI> conti∣nued longer in the <HI>Yerd,</HI> until <HI>Jo. Yerd</HI> the last Heir male of this Family, going to <HI>London,</HI> fell sick in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and dyed without Issue, and was enterr'd in St. <HI>Mar∣garets-church,</HI> afterwards converted to the Court of <HI>Marshalseys:</HI> so that <HI>Langley</HI> of <HI>Knowlton,</HI> in right of a former Match with the Heir General of this Family, was enti∣tuled to the possession of <HI>Denton,</HI> and the Demeasn of <HI>Tapton:</HI> but <HI>Edward Langley</HI> the last of this Name dying Childlesse in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in relation to a former Match of the Heir General with <HI>Peyton,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Peyton</HI> of <HI>Cambridgeshire</HI> became Heir to his Estate in <HI>Kent;</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>Robert Peyton,</HI> passed away all his Interest here to <HI>Bois. Bois</HI> by Sale demised <HI>Tapington</HI> to <HI>Verier;</HI> who almost in our Remembrance conveyed it to <HI>Mersh,</HI> the instant proprietary: But <HI>Denton</HI> was by <HI>Bois</HI> alienated to <HI>Rogers,</HI> who in those Times our Fathers lived in, translated his right into <HI>Swan;</HI> who not many years since, sold it to Sir <HI>Anth. Percival</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> and he not long since transplanted it by Sale into <HI>Phinees Andrews</HI> of <HI>Hartfordshire</HI> Esq.</P>
<P><HI>Wigmere</HI> is a third Mannor in this Parish; there was a Family of this Name in <HI>East-Kent:</HI> for in divers old Evidences which I have seen, there is mention of <HI>Will. de Wig∣mere,</HI> and divers others of this Name; but for many Ages it acknowledged the Signo∣ry of <HI>Brent,</HI> and so continued till the Beginning of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> and then <HI>Tho. Brent</HI> dy∣ing without Issue, <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to <HI>Jo. Dering</HI> of <HI>Surrenden Dering,</HI> became his Heir; in Right of which match, the Family of <HI>Dering</HI> is entituled to the instant posses∣sion.</P>
<P><HI>Madekin</HI> lies partly in <HI>Denton,</HI> and partly in <HI>Barham,</HI> and owned a Family of that Sir∣name, (as appears by the Evidences now in the hands of Mr. <HI>Oxenden,</HI>) and con∣tinued by a thread of several descents fastned to this Name; but about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the Succession of the Title was disordered, and by Sale translated into <HI>Sednor,</HI> where the possession for many years dwelt, till at last upon some Acquists in <HI>Brenchley,</HI> they withdrew themselves thither, and passed away their Interest here to <HI>Brook;</HI> in whom after it had continued three descents, the Fate of Sale, cast it into the Inheritance of <HI>Brooker;</HI> and by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the Daughter and Heir of that Family, it not long after descended to Sir <HI>Henry Oxenden,</HI> whose Grandchild <HI>Henry Oxenden</HI> Esquire, now possesseth the Signory of it.</P>
<PB N="130" REF="73"/>
<P><HI>Davington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was given to the Cloister of <HI>Black-Nuns,</HI> which was founded there by <HI>Fulke de Newenham,</HI> and dedicated to St. <HI>Mary Magdalen.</HI> In the thirty ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, that Prince confirmed them their Lands, and invested them with severall priviledges as appears <HI>Chart.</HI> 39. <HI>Hen. tertii Memb.</HI> 5. In the seventeenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the King sent his Writ to the Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> to be certified of the Estate and Revenue which belonged to this Nunnery: for the Abbess and Nuns petitioned for relief, in regard their Income was not sufficient to support them; and <HI>Jo. de Vielston</HI> then Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> returned <HI>per Sacramentum proborum &amp; le∣galium Hominum,</HI> that they had not a competent Demeasn for Subsistence; that where∣as formerly there were twenty six Nuns, now there were but fourteen, and that those could not live upon the revenue of the Covent, but had the Charity of their Friends to supply them. Thus did the Cloister of <HI>Davington</HI> remain a Seminary of religious Wo∣men, whilst their revenue without, was the Fuel which supported and nourished the Flame on the Altar. But when the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth approached, which be∣came decretory and critical to all these Nurseries of a lazy and speculative Devotion, the demeasn which sustained this Covent, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth plucked away, and in the eight and thirteeth year of his Government was by patent knit to the patrimony of Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney.</HI> And his Son Sir <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> in the eighth year of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> conveyed it by Sale to <HI>Jo. Bradborn,</HI> descended (as appears by his Seal affixed to his Deed, by which he alienates it again in the tenth year of Q. <HI>Eliza.</HI> to <HI>Avery Giles</HI>) from the <HI>Bradborns</HI> of <HI>Darbyshire.</HI> But in this Family the residence of it was very brief and transitory; for his Son <HI>Francis Giles</HI> in the twentieth year of Q. <HI>Eliza.</HI> passed it a∣way to Mr. <HI>Jo. Edwards;</HI> and from this Family though the Fate of purchase did not rend it away, yet that of marriage did: for this <HI>Jo. Edwards</HI> leaving only one Daughter and Heir called <HI>Ann,</HI> she by matching with <HI>Io. Boade</HI> of <HI>Essex</HI> Esquire, linked this to his re∣venue, and from him it is descended to Mr. <HI>Io. Boade</HI> the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>Little <HI>Davington</HI> or <HI>Davington-court,</HI> not far distant from that house which was the Nunnerie, was formerly wrapped up in that Demeasn, which confessed the Dominion of the Earls of <HI>Atholl</HI> Lords of <HI>Chilham,</HI> by whom the Mansion it self was built; as their Arms in Stone-work in the great Hall before they were taken down by Mr. <HI>Tho. Mills</HI> did abundantly testifie; and having for many years acknowledged their Signory at last it devolved to <HI>David de Strabolgie</HI> Earl of <HI>Atholl:</HI> who dying without Issue-male, in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, left it to <HI>Philippa,</HI> one of his two Coheirs who was matched to <HI>Io. Halsham;</HI> and from him did a successive Right bring it down to Sir <HI>Hugh Halsham</HI> his Grandchild, who about the beginning of <HI>H.</HI> the sixth passed it away to <HI>Ja. Drylond</HI> who determined in one Daughter and Heir called <HI>Constance Drylond</HI> who was matched to Sir <HI>Tho. VValsingham</HI> of <HI>Scadbery</HI> Knight, who in her right became possessor of it, and transmitted it to his Son Sir <HI>Ja. VValsingham,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>H.</HI> the seventh, and kept his Shrievalty at <HI>Davington;</HI> and from him did it descend to his Grandchild Sir <HI>Tho. VValsingham,</HI> who almost in our Grandfathers re∣membrance conveyed it by Sale to <HI>Simons,</HI> and he not long after to <HI>Coppinger.</HI> And his Son having about the beginning of K. <HI>James</HI> mortgaged it to <HI>Freeman;</HI> they both joyned, and by mutual Concurrence fixed their right in Mr. <HI>Tho. Mills</HI> of <HI>Norton,</HI> who deceasing without Issue-male, it came by <HI>Ann</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Io. Mill</HI> of <HI>South-hampton,</HI> who conveyed it to his Brother Dr. <HI>Mill,</HI> and he some few years past, alienated it to his Kinsman Mr. <HI>Tho. Mill,</HI> and he serled the propriety of it on his Son Mr. <HI>Tho. Mill,</HI> who hath very lately transmitted all his Right in it by Sale to <HI>Tho. Twisden</HI> Esquire Serjeant at Law, now of <HI>Brabourn</HI> in <HI>East-Malling.</HI></P>
<P>Since my Writing of this, I have discovered by an old Survey of <HI>Davington,</HI> col∣lected by Mr. <HI>Tho. Mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that <HI>Io. Lewknor</HI> of <HI>Sussex</HI> Esq; had in the twenty first year of <HI>H.</HI> the sixth an Interess in <HI>Davington-court</HI> derived to him by <HI>Joan</HI> his Wife, Sole Inhe∣ritrix of Sir <HI>Hugh Halsham,</HI> which he not long after passed away to Mr. <HI>James Drylond.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Detling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Maidstone,</HI> gave Name to a Knightly Family famous for Fortitude and Chivalrie, in token whereof a Massie Lance all wrearhed about with thinn Iron place is preserved in the Church (like that of <HI>VVillam</HI> the Conquerours at Battel in <HI>Sussex</HI>) as the very Spear by them used, and left as a memorial of their Atchivements in Arms, and an Emblem also of their extraordinary Strength and
<PB N="131" REF="73"/>Abilitie; In which respect those in <HI>Bedington</HI>-Hall in <HI>Surrey,</HI> celebrate the renown of the <HI>Carewes</HI> atchieved at Tilt and Turnament; and that in <HI>Lullingston</HI>-Hall in <HI>Kent</HI> the like for the <HI>Peches;</HI> As also that in <HI>Gerards</HI>-Hall in <HI>London,</HI> upon which a Ro∣mance is drest up by the vulgar report, fancying he was some Giant, when the truth is, he was of the Knightly Family of <HI>Gizors,</HI> and Constable of the <HI>Tower;</HI> and this his Capital Mansion was Castellated, as the Seat of the <HI>Basings</HI> was, another strenu∣ous Family at <HI>Basings</HI>-Hall in <HI>London;</HI> these matters allude much to the manner of the <HI>Romans,</HI> whose Victories were aplauded, and the Victors in their Triumphs extoll'd by Trophies and other Monuments and Ensigns of Honour, as <HI>Pancirolus, Rosinus,</HI> and others have judiciously observed, that have treated of these kind of Rituals: But to return to the Subject, from which this discourse hath diverted me, in this Family of <HI>Detling</HI> did the Possession of this place for many Ages remain constantly seated, till the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then <HI>John Detling</HI> written, in some Old Deeds, <HI>Brampton alias Det∣ling,</HI> transmitted it by Sale to <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Woodvill,</HI> Lord of the Moat in <HI>Maidston</HI> not far distant, created Earl of <HI>Rivers,</HI> Lord Treasurer and Constable of <HI>England,</HI> by his Son in law King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth in the year 1466. whose Grand∣child <HI>Anthony Woodvill</HI> Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> being attainted upon supposed Treason in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, which was made so by that Usurper, and those black Engins which he had raised upon him, because he too cordially asserted the Interest of <HI>Edward</HI> fifth, it escheated to the Crown; and that Prince in the second year of his Government granted it to Sir <HI>Robert Brackenbury</HI> Lievtenant of the Tower, who it seems disliking a Tenure which was caemented with Blood, passed away his right immediately after to <HI>Richard Lewknor</HI> who had some estate here before, by matching with <HI>Eleanor</HI> Coheir of <HI>Tho. Towne,</HI> which <HI>Tho. Towne</HI> wedded to <HI>Bennett</HI> Heir of <HI>John Detling,</HI> and this <HI>Richard Lewknor</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, gave it in franck Marriage with his Daughter to <HI>Hills. Hills</HI> resolved into two Daughters and Coheirs, one of which was married to <HI>Vincent,</HI> and the other was matched to <HI>Martin,</HI> and so upon the Division to avoid all Disorder and Confusion, <HI>Detling</HI> was split into two Mannors, one was called <HI>West-Court,</HI> which accrued to <HI>Vincent,</HI> and the other was termed <HI>East-Court</HI> which was annexed to the Demeasne of <HI>Martin. Martin,</HI> about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> sold <HI>East-Court</HI> to <HI>Webbe,</HI> in which Name after it had for severall years been fixed, it was in our Fathers Memory passed away to <HI>Smith,</HI> who not many years since a∣lienated it to Sir <HI>Edward Henden</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who upon his Decease gave it to his Nephew Sir <HI>John Henden;</HI> and from him it is now descended to his eldest Son <HI>Edward Henden,</HI> Esquire: But <HI>Westcourt</HI> was by <HI>Vincent</HI> passed away to <HI>Morton,</HI> of <HI>Whitehorse</HI> in <HI>Croyden,</HI> in which Family the Inheritance is yet remaining.</P>
<P><HI>Dimchurh</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Worth,</HI> hath nothing to make it memorable but that it was formerly the Inheritance of <HI>Twitham.

<P><HI>Ditton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkefield,</HI> with its two Appendages <HI>Brampton</HI> and <HI>Sifleston,</HI> were in times of a very high ascent, the Patrimony of a Family called <HI>Brampton;</HI> the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> (which makes a Recapitulation of the ancient owners, informs us. that anciently they were <HI>Bramptons,</HI> that is, in the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third (as the Pipe-Rolls relating to both those Kings times discover to us.) Afterwards, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, I find the <HI>Aldons</HI> (by the <HI>Pipe</HI>-Rolls) to have been Proprietaries of both these places; but, it seems, the Possession remain∣ed not long with them: for, in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, I find <HI>Stephen de Burghurst</HI> or <HI>Burwash</HI> died in the Possession of them, as appears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 4. And here the Title continued untill the forty third of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then the Lord <HI>Bartholomew Burwash</HI> this mans Grandchild, conveyed them to Sir <HI>Walter de Paveley</HI> Knight of the Garter, and he, in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, passed them away to <HI>Windlesor</HI> or <HI>Windsor:</HI> in which Family the Inheritance was placed, untill the fifteenth year of this Prince's Reign, and then they were conveyed to Sir <HI>Lewis Clifford;</HI> but in this Name they made no long abode neither. For, about the middle of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find they were alienated to <HI>Colepeper;</HI> and I discover, <HI>Richard Colepeper</HI> enjoyed them at his decease, which was in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P>The <HI>Ropers</HI> held some Estate here at <HI>Ditton</HI> by Purchase from <HI>Clifford</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, which <HI>Edmund</HI> Son of <HI>Ralph Roper</HI> died seised of, in the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth as appears <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Dodington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> contains severall places in it, of no contemptible Estimate.

But after this mans departure, I do not find that it owned this Family any farther, for this mans Sole Daughter and heir was matched to <HI>John de Bourne</HI> Son of <HI>John de Bourne,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the twenty second, the twenty third, and twenty fourth years of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, and after in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: Certainly, this Family was in times of a very high Gradation, as eminent for Estate, as it was venerable for its Antiquitie; <HI>Henry de Bourne</HI> made a Purchase of Lands and Rents in <HI>Duddington,</HI> of <HI>Matilda</HI> the Daughter of <HI>John de Duddington,</HI> (as appears by a Fine levyed in the forty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third; and the above-mentioned <HI>John de Bourn</HI> ob∣tained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <HI>Bourne, Boxley Dodington,</HI> and other places, in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; and from this <HI>John de Bourne,</HI> did Mr. <HI>William Bourne</HI> in an even stream of Descent issue forth, who almost in our Remembrance, passed away <HI>Sharsted-Court</HI> to Mr. <HI>Delawne</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> whose Son Mr. ....... <HI>Delawne</HI> is the instant Proprietarie of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ringleston</HI> is a second place of note in this Parish: of which there is a Tradition, that it borrows its principal Appellation from a <HI>Ring</HI> and a <HI>Stone;</HI> which those who were Tenants to this Mannor were to hold for such a proportion of time, as an embleme of their acknowledged Homage and Subjection: But this is but a fabulous romance in the whole frame of it; the truth is, <HI>Ring,</HI> in <HI>Saxon,</HI> imports as much as Borough or Village, so that <HI>Ringleston</HI> signifies no more but the Village-Stone, that
<PB N="133" REF="74"/>is, some eminent Stone which was placed there, to signifie and discover the utmost extent and limits of the Borough.

After this Family was expired, the <HI>Hadds</HI> a Family which was sometimes written <HI>Haddis</HI> and sometimes <HI>le Hadde,</HI> (which argues it to be of <HI>French</HI> Etymologie) was planted in the Possessi∣on, and remained many years invested in the Fee, till about the beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it passed away by Sale from them to <HI>Archer,</HI> from whom not many years after the same fatalitie brought it to devolve to <HI>Thatcher,</HI> who not many years since alienated both the Title and Demeasn to <HI>Allen;</HI> and he in our Memory, sold one moitie of it to <HI>Ford,</HI> and setled the other proportion of it upon his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Giles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Down-Court</HI> in <HI>Dodington,</HI> is an ancient Mannor, which in elder times owned the Signorie of <HI>Simon de Dodington,</HI> who flourished here in the Reign of K. <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and was entituled likewise to the Patronage or Advouson of the Church: but he determined in an only Daughter called <HI>Matilda de Dodington,</HI> who in the forty first of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third (as appears by a Fine levied in that year) passed away her Interest here to <HI>John de Bourne</HI> in which Family the Title many years after rested, untill about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth it was conveyed to <HI>Dungate</HI> of <HI>Dungate-Street</HI> in <HI>Kingsdowne.</HI> And <HI>Andrew Dungate</HI> the last of this Name at this place, dying without Issue male, his sole Daughter and Heir was marched to <HI>Killigrew,</HI> who likewise about the entrance of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, expired in two female Coheirs, whereof one was wedded to <HI>Roydon;</HI> the second to <HI>Cowland.</HI> In <HI>Roydon</HI> The Pssession was but brief; for he, about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, alienated his Proportion to <HI>Adye,</HI> a Name deeply rooted in this Track, whose Successor Mr. <HI>John Adye</HI> still enjoyes the capitall Messuage or Mansion called <HI>Down-Court;</HI> but the Mannor it self which accrued to <HI>John Cowland</HI> upon the Division of the E∣state was by his Will, made 1540. ordered to be sold to discharge Debts and Legacies, and was according to the Tenure of the premises, not long after conveyed to <HI>Allen,</HI> Ancestor to him who is the instant owner of it.</P>
<P><HI>Downe,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> is so called from its eminent situation; it was in times of elder Aspect, the Habitation of a Family which passed under that Sirname. <HI>Richard de Downe</HI> who flourished under <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and <HI>Edward</HI> the second, lies buried in the Chancell of the Church, but with no date upon his Tombe: Soon after this Family was expired, the <HI>Petleys</HI> became Lords of the Fee, and <HI>Stephen Petley</HI> is Recorded in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> to have paid an Auxiliary supply for Lands at <HI>Down,</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: and in this Family was the Title of this place successively wrapped up for many Generati∣ons, untill about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it melted away with the Name. For <HI>Jo. Petley</HI> resolved into four Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Agnes</HI> the eldest was matched to <HI>Jo. Manning,</HI> the second was espoused to <HI>Bird,</HI> the third was wedded to <HI>Casinghurst</HI> of <HI>Valous,</HI> and the fourth was married to <HI>Childrens:</HI> and upon partition of the Estate this Mannor fell to be the Inheritance of <HI>Manning,</HI> and in this Name for many years it remained constant, untill in our Fathers Remembrance, it went away by Sale to Sir <HI>Nicholas Carew</HI> of <HI>Beddington</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>Francis Carew,</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Ellis</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who not many years since alienated his Right in it to Colonel <HI>Richard Sandys,</HI> third Son of Sir <HI>Edward Sandys</HI> of <HI>Northbourne;</HI> but <HI>Down-Court</HI> was long before passed away by <HI>Manning</HI> to <HI>Palmer,</HI> which was separated from the Mannor of <HI>Downe,</HI> and singly sold by it self.</P>

<P><HI>EGerton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calehill,</HI> hath two places within the Verge of it remarkable: The first is <HI>Barmeling,</HI> which was the Seat of a Family of that Sirname, <HI>Robert de Bermeling,</HI> and in old datelesse Deeds called Sir <HI>Robert de Bar∣meling:</HI> he held it at his Decease, which was in the fifty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left Issue <HI>William de Bermeling,</HI> who was also in the enjoyment of it at his Death, which was in the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and so did <HI>Robert de Bermeling</HI> who made his Exit the thirty first of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and here in this Family hath the Propriety by an undivided Track of Succession; been so fixed and permanent, that it is yet the unseperated Inheritance of this Name of <HI>Barmeling.</HI></P>
<P>The second is <HI>Bruscombe:</HI> This was a Branch of that Demeasn which formerly acknowledg'd the <HI>Chitcrofts</HI> for its Possessors, a Name of very great Antiquity both here and at <HI>Lamberherst. Agnes</HI> wife of <HI>Richard Chitcroft</HI> held it at her Death, which was in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 198. After <HI>Chitcroft</HI> was worn out, the <HI>Beaumonts</HI> were invested in the Possession, and <HI>John de Bellemont</HI> or <HI>Beaumont</HI> deceased in the enjoyment of it, in the twen∣tieth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 14. But not long after this the Title ebbed away from this Name, and by a successive Channel of Vicissitude, was powred into <HI>Baron,</HI> a Family originally extracted out of the West, where they are yet in being; <HI>John Baron</HI> died seised of <HI>Bruscombe</HI> the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth. The Family which succeeded this in the Inheritance, upon their Re∣cesse which was about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, were the <HI>Wottons</HI> of <HI>Boughton Malherbe,</HI> in which Family the Title and Propriety hath been ever since so constantly resident, that it still rests in the Descendants and Heirs of <HI>Tho.</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton</HI> of <HI>Marley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eltham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Black heath,</HI> anciently called <HI>Ealdham,</HI> did anciently belong in part to the King, and partly to the <HI>Mandevills,</HI> from whence it came to be called <HI>Eltham Mandeville.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the first granted that Moiety which belonged to himself to <HI>John de Vescy</HI> a potent Baron in the North, in the ninth year of his Reign, and in the twelfth year, ennobles his former Concession, and gives him a new Grant to hold a Market weekly and a Fair yearly at his Mannor of <HI>Eltham.</HI> In the fourteenth year of the abovesaid Prince, <HI>John de Vescy</HI> with his Knowledge and Consent, made an Exchange with <HI>Walter de Mandevill,</HI> for that Proportion of <HI>Eltham</HI> in which he was Interessed, and gave the sixth part of the Mannor of <HI>Luton</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI> for one Messuage with the Appurtenances in <HI>El∣tham</HI> and <HI>Modingham:</HI> This <HI>John de Vescy</HI> died without Issue in the eighteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and <HI>William</HI> his Brother succeeded in the Possession, and was Lord <HI>Vescy,</HI> and had Issue by <HI>Isabell</HI> Daughter of <HI>Robert Perington,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>Robert de Wells, William de Vescy</HI> his lawfull Son born in the year 1269, who died without Issue in his Fathers life Time at <HI>Conway,</HI> and was buryed at <HI>Malton.</HI> Then <HI>William de Ʋescy</HI> having a base Son called <HI>William Ʋescy de Kildare</HI> born at <HI>Compston</HI> in the County of <HI>Kildare</HI> 1292,

<P><HI>William de Vescy</HI> of <HI>Kildare</HI> was slain in the Warrs of <HI>Stripling</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The King of <HI>England</HI> himself being then present in Person; By which means the State being in the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> he disposed of <HI>Alnewike</HI> Castle in the North,
<PB N="135" REF="75"/>to <HI>Henry de Percy,</HI> that had married <HI>Idonia de Clifford:</HI> and considering that the Estate of Lands at <HI>Eltham</HI> came from the Crown; the said Bishop reserving an estate for life, disposed of them back again to the Crown: he himself dyed there, the twenty eighth of <HI>March</HI> 1311. In the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and had bestowed great cost in building there. The Stone-work of the outward Gate being Castle-like, is a remnant of the work of that Time: The Palace it self being much more modern and Augmented by several additions of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> who in a manner kept here their constant residence, and here were made the Statutes of <HI>Eliham,</HI> the pre∣cedents for Government of the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s House to this day.

<P>K. <HI>Edward</HI> the third intending to give a princely reception to K. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> which had been Prisoner in <HI>England,</HI> and came over to visit the King,

<P>K. <HI>Henry</HI> sixth made it his principal place of residence, and granted the Tenants of the Mannor of <HI>Eltham,</HI> a Charter of renovation of a Market in the seventeenth of his reign; which containeth more ample priviledges than any such grant that yet I have seen, as will be likewise evident to those who will peruse the original Record of that year in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>K. <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth greatly to his cost repaired the House,

<P>K. <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh set up the fair Front there, towards the Moat, and was usually resident there. I find in a Record, (in the Office of Arms) that he did usually dine in the Hall, and all his Officers kept their Tables there; and at such time as he created <HI>Stanley</HI> Baron <HI>Monteagle,</HI> by reason of some Infection then reigning in and near the City of <HI>London</HI> none were permitted to dine in the Kings Hall but the officers of Arms, who at the serving in the Kings second Course of meat according to the Custome, came and proclaimed the Kings style, and the style of the said new Lord.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth built much at <HI>Greenwich</HI> with Bricks made here at <HI>Eltham,</HI> and then neglected this place; yet he lived here sometime, and kept a royal Christmass at this place, 1515. There is an ancient place in this Parish called <HI>Henleys,</HI> which in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was a Marnor belonging to <HI>John de Henley,</HI> whose House was moated about, the situation is yet extant below the Conduit-head; but he dying without Issue, it came by his guift to King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and was annexed unto the Mannor by <HI>William de Brantingham</HI> his Feoffee.</P>
<P>The Mannor <HI>East-horn</HI> and <HI>Well-hall,</HI> was in the year 1100. possest by <HI>Jordan de Iri∣set</HI> or <HI>Brinset</HI> first establisher of the Order of Knights Hospitallers here in <HI>England.</HI> In Ages of a lower Descent, that is, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it was held by <HI>Iohn de Poultney,</HI> and from that Family about the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it devolved by Sale to <HI>Chichley; Iohn Tatterst all</HI> married <HI>Agnes</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Iohn Chichley</HI> of <HI>Wol∣wich</HI> Son of <HI>William Chichley</HI> Alderman of <HI>London,</HI> and by her had <HI>VVell-hall</HI> and <HI>East∣horn;</HI> he had Issue by her two Daughters, <HI>Ann</HI> was married unto Sir <HI>Ralph Hastings,</HI> and <HI>Margery</HI> was married unto <HI>Iohn Roper</HI> Esquire: and <HI>Agnes</HI> their Mother was remar∣ried to <HI>VVill.

<P><HI>Mottingham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackheath,</HI> is a Hamlet and member to <HI>Eltham,</HI> enjoying like priviledges, which are annexed to both these places, as being of ancient Demealn. It was formerly written <HI>Modingham,</HI> denoting that it was proudly situated, (for so we interpret <HI>Mod</HI> in old <HI>English:</HI>) It passed away from the Crown, with the Man∣nor of <HI>Eltham</HI> to <HI>Jo. de Vescy,</HI> and returned back again with it, inhabited in the time of K. <HI>Edw.</HI> the third by the Family of <HI>Bankwell;</HI> and after, in the reign of <HI>H.</HI> the sixth, by the <HI>Chesmans:</HI> the last of which Name which held this place, was <HI>Tho.

<P>A strange and marvellous Accident happened at this place upon the fourth day of <HI>August</HI> 1585, in a Field which belongeth to Sir <HI>Percival Hart.</HI> Betimes in the morning, the ground began to sink, so much, that three great Elme-Trees were suddenly swallowed into the Pit; the tops falling downward into the hole: And before ten of the Clock, they were so overwhelmed, that no part of them might be discerned, the Concave being suddenly filled with water: the Compass of the hole was about 80. yards, and so profound, that a sounding line of fifty Fathoms, could hard∣ly find or feel any bottome; ten yards distance from that place; there was another piece of ground sunk in like manner, near the high-way, and so nigh a dwelling house, that the Inhabitants were greatly terrified therewith.</P>
<P><HI>Edenbridge</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Westerham,</HI> was ever esteemed a Chappel of ease, to the Parish of <HI>Westerham.</HI> The first that I discover by the beams of Record, to have been possest of <HI>Edenbridge,</HI> were the <HI>Stangraves,</HI> who had here their capital Mansion, which was known by their Name. <HI>John de Stangrave</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to <HI>Edenbridge,</HI> in the twenty sixth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first. Sir <HI>Rob. de Stangrave</HI> was his Son and Heir, who was with <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there for his generous Service received the Order of Knighthood, and dyed seised of <HI>Eden∣bridge</HI> and <HI>Stangrave,</HI> the twelfth year of <HI>E.</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

After the <HI>Stan∣graves</HI> were vanished, the <HI>Dynleys</HI> were setled in the Signory of these above-mentioned places; <HI>Jo. de Dynley</HI> had a Confirmation of the Chatter of Free-warren to <HI>Eden-bridge,</HI> in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and immediately after passed away his In∣terest here to <HI>Hugh de Audley</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> Lord of the Mannor and Castle of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir, the Lady <HI>Margaret Audley, Stangrave</HI> and <HI>Edenbridge,</HI> came to acknowledge the Signory of <HI>Ralph Stafford,</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> and he dyed seised of them in the forty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and in this Family of <HI>Stafford,</HI> as they were successively Earls of <HI>Stafford,</HI> and Dukes of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> was the propriety of these places resident, untill the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> Lord high Constable of <HI>England,</HI> having unadvisedly consulted with a Monk and a Wizzard touching the Succession of the Crown, fomented so Vast a Stock of Fears and Jealousies in the Brain of that Cautious Prince, that they could not be extinguished but by his Blood, which was poured out on a Scaffold as the last expiation of that Treason, which was by Cardinal <HI>Wolsey</HI> pinn'd upon him, and likewise of his Prince's Fury. Upon this his untimely Exit, his Estate escheated to the Crown,
<PB N="137" REF="76"/>and King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth not many years after, granted <HI>Westerham, Eden Bridge,</HI> and <HI>Stangrave,</HI> which were parcell of the Confiscation, to Sir <HI>John Gresham</HI> Knight, from whom they by Descent are now devolved to <HI>Marmaduke Gresham</HI> Esquire, who enjoys the instant Possession of them.</P>
<P><HI>Delaware</HI> is a Seat of very venerable Account in this Parish: It was the Seat of Gentlemen of that Name as high as the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, as appears by old Evidences, now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Seyliard;</HI> of which, <HI>Robert de la Ware</HI> was the last, who about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, went out without Issue-male: so that <HI>Dionysia Delaware,</HI> who was matched to <HI>William Paulin,</HI> became Heir to this place. In <HI>Paulin</HI> it remained constantly resident, till the beginning of the Rule of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then <HI>William Paulin</HI> determined in a Daughter and Heir likewise, who was wedded to <HI>John Seyliard</HI> of <HI>Seyliard</HI> in <HI>Hever,</HI> which is still in the Possession of Mr. <HI>Seyliard</HI> of <HI>Gabriells</HI> in this Parish; and who descen∣ded from <HI>Ralph de Seyliard,</HI> who flourished about the Reign of King <HI>Stephen:</HI> In an old Pedigree of <HI>Seyliard,</HI> now treasured up amongst the Evidences of <HI>De∣laware,</HI> there is enrolled the Coppy of a Deed without date, by which, <HI>Almerick d'Eureux</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> who flourished in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, de∣mises Lands to <HI>Martin at Seyliard,</HI> and other Lands called <HI>Hedinden</HI> to <HI>Richard at Seyliard,</HI> who were Sons of <HI>Ralph:</HI> from which <HI>Ralph, John Seyliard</HI> Esquire, now Proprietary of this an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent Mansion of <HI>Delaware,</HI> by a Steady and unbroken Current of many Descents in a Direct Line is originally extracted.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Sharnden</HI> in this Parish, was parcell of that Estate which belon∣ged to the Lords <HI>Cobham,</HI> of <HI>Sterborough</HI> Castle not far distant, and continued fol∣ded up in the Patrimony of this Family, till the Government of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; and then <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> of <HI>Sterborough</HI> deceasing without Issue∣male, <HI>Anne,</HI> matched to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> became his Heir: in which Name and Family, the Title of this place successively streamed down, till almost our Times; and then the Lady <HI>Katharine Borough,</HI> to whom it was assigned by <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Borough</HI> her Husband, to defray Debts and other Uses, passed it away to Sir <HI>Edward Richardson,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, whose Grandchild the Lord <HI>Edward Richardson</HI> Baron of <HI>Cromartie</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> does now possesse the Signory and Inheritance of it.</P>
<P><HI>Elham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Lovingborough,</HI> is anciently written <HI>Helham,</HI> which denotes the Situation of it in a Valley amongst Hills. Though now the Mag∣nificent Structures, which in elder Times were here, be dismantled, and have only left a Masse of deplored Rubble to direct us were they stood, yet in <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book it is written, (that the Earl of <HI>Ewe</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> and neere in Alliance to the Conquerour) held it, and left the Reputation of an Honour unto it, as the Record of the Aid granted at the making the Black Prince Knight in the twentieth of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, doth warrant. For the Mannor of <HI>Mount</HI> adjacent to <HI>Elham,</HI> is said to be held of the Honour of the Earl of <HI>Ewe</HI> by Knights Service.

<P><HI>Canterwood</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, whose Possessors, I confesse, I could never trace out, by any Print of publick Record; therefore I endeavoured to give my self Satisfaction, by the private Evidences: but, the Heir being under Age, the Deeds were deposited in the Hands of those who represented my Design in Surveying them through the Mists of Cautious Jealousies and Distrusts, and so my Attempt became fruitlesse. All the Intelligence I could gain (as in Relation to that place) was collected from an old Manuscript, whose Hand seems contem∣porary to the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and what I have drained from thence, I shall now represent to the Reader. <HI>Canterwood,</HI> says this Escript, was formerly the Estate of <HI>Thomas de Garwinton de Welle</HI> in <HI>Littlebourne,</HI> who flourished in the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> the second, and <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, whose great Grandchild <HI>Will.

<P><HI>Bowick</HI> is a sixth place, which must now come within the pale of this Dis∣course.

<P><HI>Ladwood</HI> is an eighth Mannor in this Parish, written in old Evidences <HI>Lads∣wood,</HI> from whence we may spin out a more then probable Conjecture, that, be∣fore the erecting the house by <HI>Rolfe,</HI> it was a Wood belonging to <HI>Lad</HI> of <HI>Bo∣wick;</HI> but for some hundreds of years, that is, fince the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it hath constantly related to the Family of <HI>Rolfe,</HI> a Name which Mr. <HI>Thinne</HI> conjectures in a Pedigree which he collected of this Family, was contracted from the ancient German Name <HI>Rodolphus:</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lambert,</HI> in his Kentish Perambu∣lation, mentions one <HI>Rolph</HI> a <HI>Saxon,</HI> who added much to the Castle of <HI>Rochester,</HI> from whom it is not altogether improbable, this Family, which hath been so ancient at <HI>Elham,</HI> might extract their first original.</P>
<P><HI>Clavertie</HI> is the last place in this Parish, which may exact our mention: it did belong before the Suppression to the Knights Hospitallers, and was one of those places, in this Track, which was a Commaundry to the more general Seminary of this Order planted at <HI>Edwell.</HI> Upon the Dissolution of this Order, here in <HI>England,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, who condemned their Disorder and Luxury, only to improve his own, like the <HI>Lapwing,</HI> who cries most when she is farthest off from her Nest, this was added to the Demeasne of the Crown: and King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth granted it to <HI>Peter Heyman</HI> Esquire, who was one of the Gentlemen off his Bedchamber, and great Grandfather to Sir <HI>Henry Hamon</HI> Baronet, who was the late Proprietarie of this Mannor of <HI>Claverty,</HI> a person to whom if I should not affirm my self signally and extraordinarily engaged, I deserved to be represented to Posterity under the darkest Complexion of Ingratitude.</P>

<P>Before I leave this Discourse of <HI>Eightam,</HI> I must inform the Reader of two things.
<PB N="141" REF="78"/>First that <HI>Edward</HI> the second, in the ninth year of his Reign, granted Licence to <HI>Will. de Inge</HI> the Judge, to hold a Market here Weekly on the Monday, and a Fair yearly at <HI>Eightham,</HI> by the space of three days, <HI>viz.</HI> the Vigill, the day of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and the day after. Secondly that the Family of <HI>James</HI> now Possessors of <HI>Eightam,</HI> were originally called <HI>Hastrecht,</HI> as being Lords of a place of that Name neer <HI>Gouda,</HI> and were branched out from the ancient Family of <HI>Arkell,</HI>

Roger James,</HI> Son of <HI>Jacob van Hastrecht,</HI> came out of <HI>Cleve,</HI> (whither his Ancestor a yonger Son of the Lord of <HI>Hastrecht,</HI> had been chased by one of the Lords of <HI>Holland,</HI> because his Father, who likewise was forced to <HI>Drunen</HI> neer <HI>Huesden,</HI> by that Count, had been an eager Parti∣san of his enemy, the Bishop of <HI>Vtretcht</HI>) into <HI>England,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, and being called after the <HI>Belgick</HI> mode, <HI>Roger Jacobs,</HI> the English by a more soft and gentle pronunciation, filed off the roughnesse of the Accent and by melting it into a more narrow Volume, contracted it into <HI>James.</HI> By marriage, the Family of <HI>Haestrecht</HI> and <HI>Arkell</HI> above mentioned, are allyed to the eminent House of <HI>Wassenaer,</HI> issued out from the ancient Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> as likewise to the Family of <HI>Waermont</HI> neer <HI>Leyden,</HI> who matched with the Heir of <HI>Hastrecht</HI> of <HI>Drunen,</HI> (where this Family had for many Descents been planted, ever since their first expulsion thither, by the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI>) who was Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and <HI>Drosart</HI> of <HI>Breda,</HI> when it was under the Government and Scepter of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Cleres</HI> is the second place of Note in this Parish; it was formerly called <HI>Aldham,</HI> as being for many years the Patrimony of that Family, the last of which was Sir <HI>Tho. de Aldham,</HI> who resolved into three Female Coheirs: ....... matched to <HI>Newborough</HI> of the County of <HI>Dorsett, Margery</HI> matched to <HI>Martin de Pecham,</HI> and <HI>Isolda</HI> wedded to <HI>John St. Clere.</HI> Upon the partition of his patrimony, this place was, about the be∣ginning of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, annexed to the Inheritance of St. <HI>Clere,</HI> and so it becamein pro∣cedure of Time styled <HI>Aldham St. Cleres:</HI> but Custome and vulgar Use did not long after file off the first Appellation, so that it hath for diverse Generations, been styled singly St. <HI>Cleres. Isolda St. Clere</HI> Widow of this <HI>John,</HI> did, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third pay respective Aid, for her Lands at <HI>Eightham,</HI> at the making the Black Prince Knight. And in this Family did the Stream of Possession carry down the Pos∣session of this place, till towards the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was ali∣enated from this Name and setled in <HI>Richard Empson,</HI> the grand Projector, who had wire-drawn, by his close and dextrous Artifices, the Treasure of the Kingdome into such subtile Threads, as he had almost wound it all into the Kings Exchequer: But he being convicted of Felony for his many Excesses, in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this was confiscated to the Crown, and there it was not many years after by that Prince, granted to Sir <HI>Thomas Bullen</HI> Knight of the Garter, and created Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> and <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> in the year 1529, whose infortunate Son <HI>George</HI> Viscount <HI>Rochford,</HI> being blasted with the black Aspersion of Treason, which was multiplyed and inforced to that Bulke, that the weight of it sunk him upon a Bloody and untimely Scaffold, and then this Mannor upon the Death of his Father, which was in the thirtyeth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, was seised on by the Crown, as being setled before on him and his Heirs male, of whom this unhappy Lord was the last: Some few years after, it was by Royall Conces∣sion from the abovesaid Prince, made the Patrimony of <HI>George Moulton</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Moulton</HI> in <HI>Hadloe,</HI> a Man of high Repute in those Times, and much interessed in the Favour of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: whose Grandchild <HI>Robert Moulton</HI> Esquire, almost in Times within the pale of our Remembrance, alienated his Right in it to Sir <HI>John Syd∣ley</HI> Knight and Baronet, who hath upon the old Foundation erected that magnificent Pile, which for the Grandeur, Elegance, and Majestick Aspect it carryes to the publick View, surrenders a Priority, but to few Structures in this County.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moat</HI> is the third and last place which summons our Remembrance.

<PB N="143" REF="79"/>Testimony of one <HI>Robert de Evington,</HI> who was Ancestor to the <HI>Evingtons</HI> of <HI>Elm∣sted,</HI> of whom there is mention in the Deeds of this place, in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first. After this Family was gon out, the <HI>Gays</HI> a Family of no mean Account in this Track, were incorporated into the Possession, descen∣ded originally out of <HI>France,</HI> where there is a Family which even at this Day is known by the Name of <HI>Le-gay,</HI> and is planted in <HI>Normandy,</HI> from whence those of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Gernesey</HI> are extracted, a Branch of which is transplanted into <HI>South-Hampton,</HI> and there for ought I know flourishes at present. And to justifie the Truth of this their Extraction, in the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Horton</HI>-Priory, there is mention of one <HI>John le Gay</HI> who was a Benefactor to their House, and though they are called at this day, only, without the Addition, <HI>Gay;</HI> yet this hath happened by Disuse and Intermission, by not adding it in their Customary writing and af∣fixing it to their Name. But to proceed: <HI>Evington Court</HI> though it was not ori∣ginally erected by this Family, yet certainly it was much inforced by Supple∣ment, and additionall Building; for diverse places of the House are in Relation to the Name, adorned with Nose-Gays. In Conclusion, after it had owned many of this Name of no vulgar Ranck for its Proprietaries, it was, about the begin∣ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, by <HI>Christopher Gay,</HI> alienated to <HI>John Honywood</HI> Esquire, of the eldest Family of the <HI>Honywoods;</HI> from whom in a direct Line, <HI>Edward Honywood</HI> Esquire, Son and Heir of Sir <HI>John Honywood,</HI> lately deceased, is extracted, and is now invested in the Possession of this place.</P>
<P><HI>Elmested</HI> had the Grant of a Market obtained to it, to be observed weekly on the Thursday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil, and Day of Saint <HI>James,</HI> by the Procurement of <HI>Henry de Haut Pat.</HI> 28. <HI>Edwardi tertii N.</HI> 20.</P>
<P><HI>Elmeston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wingham,</HI> was parcell of the Demeasne of the Lord <HI>Leybourn: Juliana de Leybourn</HI> Wife of <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> had an estate here at her Death, which was in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

Esc. Num.</HI> 57. and as it appears without any visible Alliance, that could justify their Title to her Estate: for the Crown feised upon it as legally escheated,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard <HI>the second granted</HI> Elmston <HI>to</HI> Sim∣on Bur∣leigh, <HI>and upon his Attaint it returned to the Crown.</HI></NOTE> by Defailance of any who could pretend a Claim unto it. King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, about the fourteenth year of his Reign, granted it to the Abby of <HI>Childrens Langley.</HI> Before I proceed any farther in this Discourse, I shall justifie what I before asserted, that is, that the first Husband of <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> was <HI>John de Hastings</HI> a Kinsman of <HI>Lawrence de Hastings,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> but not his Son <HI>John de Hastings,</HI> as some suppose: and this is obvious, if we consider that <HI>William de Clinton</HI> deceased by the Testimo∣ny of all, in the twenty eighth yeer of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Juliana</HI> his Widow called in the Escheat Roll <HI>Comitissa de Huntington,</HI> dyed in the forty third year of that Prince, and <HI>John de Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington</HI> in the year 1375, which happened in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, which must necessarily, upon a serious Computation of Time, fall out six years, after this Countesse's Decease, to whom had she been matched, she would have preserved the Stile of <HI>Comitissa de Pembroke,</HI> and not that of <HI>Huntington.</HI></P>
<P>But to return into that Track, from whence this Digression hath made me wander; after it remained Cloistered up in the Revenue of the Church, for diverse Ages, untill the Title was by the Generall Dissolution dislodged, and in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was by Royall Concession from that Prince, invested in Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Serjeant at Law, and a Man under an eminent Character in those Times; from whom, about the beginning of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, it passed a∣way by Sale to <HI>Linch,</HI> a Family of good Antiquity in <HI>Kent,</HI> from whom the <HI>Linches</HI> of <HI>Lemster</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> are primitively descended, and have been for some Descents seated at <HI>Linch Knock,</HI> a Castle in that Province. After the <HI>Linches,</HI> the <HI>Gibs's</HI> about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> were by Purchase seated in the Inheritance, and continued in it, untill very lately the Title was unfixed, and, by the Transposition of Sale, planted in Mr. <HI>Jaques</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Erith</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Little</HI> and <HI>Lesness,</HI> was a Mannor which was circum∣scribed within the Revenue of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> that powerfull Baton, whose Story I shall pencill out more exactly at <HI>Leeds</HI>-Castle: but, before him, <HI>Guncelin de Badelesmer,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This</HI> Gun∣celin de Badeles∣mer, <HI>was Justice of</HI> Chester. <HI>See Mr.</HI> King's Vale Royall.</NOTE> who lyes buried at <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> with a fair Pourtraicture upon his Tomb, cut out in Wood, enjoyed it, and held it at his Decease, which was in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 50. And this <HI>Guncelin,</HI> was Son to <HI>Giles de Badelesmer,</HI> who, as the Annals of St. <HI>Austins</HI> in∣forms us, was slain at a Battell commenced against the <HI>Welsh,</HI> in the year 1258, whilst he vigorously asserted the Interest of his Country, against their wild Ex∣cursions: But to advance where I first left off, <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer</HI> before mentioned, had such a particular Affection to this place, that in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, he obtained a Charter of Free-warren to this Mannor, and suddenly after, by his Confederacy with <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and the rest of the Nobility knit together in Combination against that Prince, forfeited his Estate and Life to the Crown. And then <HI>Edward</HI> the second, (as appears by the Patent Rolls of that time) in the fifteenth year of his Reign, grants it for life to <HI>David de Strabolgie</HI> Earl of <HI>Atholl,</HI> Son to the infortunate <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Atholl,</HI> who was offered up a Sacrifice to the Fury of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, because he had done too little for him, and too much for his bleeding and gasping Country of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and this Earl held it at his Decease, which was in the first year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 85. After his Death, it reverts to the Crown, and then King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, not only reverses the Processe and Judgement, issued out against <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> but likewise by Patent in the second year of his Reign, restores this Mannor and diverse other Lands to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer</HI> his Son. And he dyed seised of it, in the twelfth year of that Prince's Reign, but left no Issue-male; so that his four Daughters became his Heirs, whereof <HI>Eliz.</HI> was one of them, who was first matched to <HI>William Bohun</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> and after to <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> Earl of <HI>March,</HI> to whose Patrimony this in his Wives Right upon the Quadripartite Division of this wide Estate, was united; and <HI>Edmund de Mortimer</HI> this Mans Son, enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Bedenwell</HI> in this Parish had formerly the Repute of a Mannor, when it was the Inheri∣tance of a Family called <HI>Boreford</HI> or more vulgarly <HI>Burford: Rose de Burford</HI> held it at her Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Ese. Num.</HI> 52. And afterwards I find <HI>James de Burford</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <HI>Bedenwell</HI> in <HI>Erith,</HI> in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After this Family was expired, which was before the end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it came to be the Possession of <HI>Draper,</HI> descended from an ancient Family of that Name in the County of <HI>Notingham,</HI> who concluded in a Female Heir. For <HI>William Killom</HI> matched with the sole Daughter of <HI>John Draper,</HI> by whom he obtained <HI>Bedenwell;</HI> but with this Proviso that he should change his Name to <HI>Draper,</HI> which hath been ever since both by <HI>Draper</HI> of <HI>Crayford,</HI> and <HI>Draper</HI> of <HI>Hering-Hill</HI> in <HI>Erith</HI> punctually performed. But since this solemne Stipulation, <HI>Bedenwell</HI> in seve∣rall peices hath been sold to <HI>Turner, Gainsford</HI> of <HI>Crowherst</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> (who not many years since, alienated his Proportion to <HI>Cholmeley</HI>) and others; so that being thus broken into Fragments, it hath now lost the estimate of a Mannor, and is to be entombed in Silence.</P>
<P><HI>Hering-Hill</HI> is a place not to be forgotten, having been in elder Times the Residence of a Family called <HI>Abell.</HI> The first whom I find represented to us, under a Cha∣racter of estimate, was Sir <HI>John Abell,</HI> who was in the List of the Kentish Knights, which were Assistant to King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at his Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land; John Abell</HI> his Successor was a Judge (as is manifest by the patent Rolls, of the <HI>Tower</HI>) in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and it is very probable, that it was either this <HI>John Abell</HI> or his Father, that obtained a Charter of Free-warren to the Mannor of <HI>Catford</HI> in <HI>Lewsham</HI> (which was after sold to <HI>William de Monta∣cute</HI>) in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. In the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth: I find, by the Registers of the Crown Office, one <HI>Edward Abell</HI> to have been in Commission for the Peace, and he lyes enter'd in <HI>Erith</HI> Church, not in the Coemitery or Church-yard: though I confesse, upon a large square Plate of Wood, there is a Register of those accurately enrolled, who were Possessors of <HI>Hering-Hill,</HI> from <HI>John Abell</HI> the Judge, down to another <HI>John Abell</HI> who dyed possest of it about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> but the date is so violated by Time and the Impression of the injurious Elements, that it is hardly visible, much lesse intelligible; the last of this Family at this place, was <HI>John Abell,</HI> who about the year 1611, joyning with his Father <HI>Samuell Abell,</HI> alienated his Concernment here to Mr. <HI>William Draper,</HI> whose Successor Mr..... <HI>Draper,</HI> now of the County of <HI>Oxford,</HI> is the instant Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Lesnes Abby</HI> was founded by <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England</HI> un∣der <HI>H.</HI> the second, in the year 1179 and dedicated to St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, the Saint of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who as he had been above the Kings Will on earth, was now above his Faith in Heaven, being after his, but early Canonization, grown into such Ve∣neration and Estimate, that Orisons and Prayers, Shrines, and Altars, Abbyes and Tem∣ples, were offered up to his Name, of which this was none of the least, being a House of black Canons, or Canons of St. <HI>Augustins.</HI> This <HI>Richard de Lucy</HI> the Founder, was Son of <HI>Richard,</HI> who was Son of <HI>Roger de Chilham,</HI> and he was Son of <HI>Fulbert de Dover,</HI> who entred into <HI>England</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and changed his Name of <HI>Lucy</HI> to <HI>Dover,</HI> (of which, first, there is not only a Signiory or Lordship, but likewise a Family at this instant remaining in <HI>France</HI>) because he was one of those eight, to whom certain Knights-Fees were assigned by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, to be Assistant to <HI>John de Fiennes,</HI> in the Guard of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle; thus much for his Extraction. Now for his Dignity, he was not only Lord Chief Justice, but likewise Protector of <HI>England,</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, in his Absence in <HI>France,</HI> which great Office he managed with so much Fidelity, Prudence, and Magnanimity, that when the Earl of <HI>Boloign</HI> invaded this Island, in
<PB N="146" REF="81"/>the thirteenth year of the abovesaid Prince, he was forced to retire with Shame Confusion, and Losse: which Action must certainly have improved his Name to a very high Estimate, in the Opinion of those Times. Yet notwithstanding he de∣vested himself of that Pomp and Pageantry, these great Offices had made him glitter with (which Conquest, that he made upon himself within, was of more Importance, then any he could have atchieved without) and clouded himself in a Monks Cowle, and became the Prior to that Covent, he himself had erected, and there likewise found his place of Sepulture: And it is probable, that those Coffins, with Pourtraictures insculped, which were discovered in a Grotto or Vault, upon the breaking down the Foundation of this House, in the Government of King <HI>James,</HI> were the Exchequers which treasured up, not only the Reliques of this Sir <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> but likewise the remains of others of the same Family: But to proceed, the Prior of this place was in that Repute, that it was customary for him (as the Records of the Church of <HI>Rochester</HI> tell us) to have his Indu∣ction into this place, either by the Bishop immediately, or else by some Proxie, who represented the Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI>'s Person. And in this State it continued, untill Cardinall <HI>Wolsey</HI> laid the Foundation of his eminent Colledge of <HI>Christchurch</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and thenwith the consent of the present Abbot, in the year 1525, it was supprest, and the Revenue of this Cloister, being found in the Hands of the abovesaid Cardinal at his Death, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, united to the Income of the Crown, where it dwelt, untill it was gran∣ted to <HI>William Brereton</HI> Esquire, who being engaged in the fatall Business of <HI>Ka∣tharine Howard,</HI> was attainted, and executed, upon whose Tragedy, it returned to the Crown; and was in the thirty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to Sir <HI>Ralph Sadler;</HI> and he not long after passed it away to Mr. <HI>Henry Cook;</HI> in whose Suc∣cessors, the Possession was resident, untill almost our Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to Sir <HI>Thomas Gainsford</HI> of <HI>Crowherst</HI> in <HI>Surrey;</HI> who not many years since, demised his Right in it to Mr. <HI>Haws</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> who dying lately with∣out Issue, hath setled it for ever, on the Hospital of St. <HI>Bartholomews</HI> in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>In the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> obtained the Grant of a Market to <HI>Erith,</HI> on the Thursday, and a three Days Fair at St. <HI>Crosse,</HI> and another three Days Fair, the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Whitson Week.</P>
<P><HI>Lesnes,</HI> had by the Mediation of <HI>William de Wilton,</HI> a Grant of a Market, procured to be observed there on the Thursday, and a Fair to continue yearly the Eve, <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Judes</HI> Day, and three Days after, as is manifest, <HI>Pat.</HI> 41. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 48.</P>
<P><HI>Estling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> gave Sirname to a Family, who had here an eminent Mansion called <HI>Northcourt,</HI> the last of which Family, was <HI>Ralph de Estling,</HI> whose Daughter and Heir <HI>Alice de Estling,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Ed.</HI> the first, was matched to <HI>Fulke de Peyforer, Custos</HI> of the Fleet, and Westminster in <HI>London,</HI> who in her Right became Lord of this place, and in the thirty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, to inforce his Interest here, obtained a Charter of Free∣warren to this place; and in this Family did it reside, untill the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and then was <HI>Northcourt, Denton,</HI> and <HI>Plomford,</HI> Mannors, which came along to <HI>Peyforer</HI> with <HI>Northcourt,</HI> were sold away to <HI>Roger</HI> Lord <HI>Leybourn;</HI> and his Widow <HI>Juliana de Leybourn</HI> held them at her Decease, which was in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

And after her Decease, they devolved to <HI>John de Hastings,</HI> a Kinsman of <HI>Lawrence de Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who was the first Husband of her Daughter and Heir <HI>Juliana de Leybourn;</HI> after his Decease remarried to <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> who in her Right was likewise possest of them, but likewise Deceased without any Issue by her, in the twenty eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, after whose Death, it is more then probable, she continued a Widow. For in the Inquisition taken in the forty third year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, she is styled <HI>Comitissa de Huntington,</HI> and was found upon a serious win∣nowing, both of her Direct and collaterall Alliances, to have no Heirs that could directly pretend to the Title, so that her Estate here laps'd to the Crown, and King
<PB N="147" REF="81"/><HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the fiftieth year of his Rule, granted the Mannors of <HI>North∣court, Denton,</HI> and <HI>Plomford,</HI> to the Abby of St. <HI>Mary Grace</HI> on <HI>Tower Hill,</HI> where they rested untill the Dissolution: and then King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted them to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney</HI> one of his Privy Councel, whose lavish and unthrifty Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> after his Estate mouldered away by Retail in the eighth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed them away to <HI>Martin James</HI> Esquire, whose great Grandchild, Mr. <HI>Walter James,</HI> is at this instant the indisputable Proprietary of them.</P>
<P><HI>Huntingfield</HI> in <HI>Estling,</HI> gave Sirname to that illustrious Family of <HI>Huntingfield,</HI> and stands a Monument to this Day, to inforce and perpetuate its Memory to Posterity, though the Name be long since extinguished, and gon out in two Daughters and Co∣heirs, being entombed in <HI>Coupledick</HI> and <HI>Norwich.</HI> The capital Seat of this Family, was at <HI>West-Wickham,</HI> on the Skirts of <HI>Surrey,</HI> where I shall make a more ample men∣tion of them: but they had other parcels of Land, which lay scattered in the severall Parishes of <HI>Northsleet, Mepham, Ludsdown, Cobham</HI> and other places, and it is probable this Family was possest of an Estate likewise in <HI>Somersetshire.</HI> For in Mr. <HI>Bishe,</HI> late prin∣ted Notes upon <HI>Upton,</HI> one <HI>Walter de Huntingfield,</HI> is represented as Teste to that memorable Compact, which bears Date the twenty eighth of Aprill, in the forty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and was made between <HI>Henry de Ferneburgh,</HI> and the Abbot and Covent of <HI>Glastenbury,</HI> to defend the Lands of the abovesaid Ab∣bot, against all the Claim or Pretence, of the Bishop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> with the Dean and Canons of the same place, or any of their Champions; and certainly, this <HI>Walter de Huntingfield,</HI> is he, who is mentioned, to have paid respective Aid, in the Book called <HI>Testa de Nevist,</HI> for much Land which he held in <HI>Kent,</HI> at the Marriage of <HI>Isab.</HI> the Kings Sister, in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. The last of this Family who was possessor of this Mannor was Sir <HI>John Huntingfield,</HI> who was summoned to sit as a Baron in Parliament, in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third; and he passed it away to Sir <HI>Sim. de Burley,</HI> in whom it was resident, until the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; and then he being by Parliament convicted of high Trea∣son, for seeking in a Time, when too much Loyalty was ruinous, to support the shaking Prerogative of his Prince, against the Assaults and Impressions made upon it, by some of the ambitious Nobility; This Mannor with <HI>Northcourt,</HI> likewise in this Parish, which was granted to him upon the Decease of <HI>Juliana</HI> Countesse of <HI>Huntington,</HI> escheated to the Crown, and there made its aboad, untill the twenty first of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then that Prince, setled it by a new Grant, as ap∣pears <HI>Pat.</HI> 1. <HI>An.</HI> 21. <HI>Ric.</HI> 2. <HI>Memb.</HI> 35. <HI>Pars tertia.</HI> On the Dean and Canons of St. <HI>Stephens</HI> in <HI>Westminster,</HI> and continued chained to their Revenue, untill the Link was by the general Dissolution of Religious Gonventions, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, untied and broken, and then being cast into the Demeasne of the Crown, it was in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to <HI>Alured Randolph,</HI> and <HI>John Guldford</HI> Esquires, and they not long after, conveyed their In∣terest in it by Sale to Sir <HI>Thomas Moil,</HI> from whom the same Fatality in the se∣venth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, carried it away, and transplanted it into <HI>John Wild</HI> Esquire: and he not long after, transmitted his Concernment in it to <HI>Gates,</HI> and from this Name, the Propriety about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was by the Vicissitude of Sale, conveyed to <HI>Martin James</HI> Esquire, Examiner of the Chancery, from whom the Title by descendant Right is flowed down to his great Granchild, Mr. <HI>Walt.

<P><HI>Estling</HI> had the Grant of a Market, obtained to be held there Weekly, and a two Days Fair at St. <HI>Crosse,</HI> by the Mediation of <HI>Fulke de Peyferer,</HI> in the thirty second of <HI>Edward</HI> the first.</P>
<P><HI>Diven Arnold</HI> is a third place of mark, in <HI>Estling.</HI> It is called so, because it was in Ages of a very venerable Inscription; the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Dive,</HI> and it had the Addition of <HI>Arnold,</HI> because one <HI>Arnoldus de Dive</HI> possest it, and is often mentioned in Deeds without date, and was Teste to a Deed, whereby <HI>John de Valoigns,</HI> does convey Lands to <HI>Robert de Dive,</HI> Prior of the Hospiral of St. <HI>Johns</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> which is justified by a fine levyed between the said <HI>John</HI> and this <HI>Robert,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. And in this Family did it continue, untill the Be∣ginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was alienated to <HI>Sharp,</HI> of <HI>Nin-place</HI> in great
<PB N="148" REF="82"/><HI>Chart,</HI> in which Name the Signorry and Title was for sundry Generations constant, untill about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, it was conveyed away to <HI>Thurstan</HI> of <HI>Challock,</HI> a Name of great Antiquity in that Parish, from whom not many years af∣ter it went over by Sale to <HI>Jo. Wild</HI> Esquire, and he, in the entrance of the Government of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by the same Revolution, disposed of his Right in it to <HI>Gates,</HI> who alienated it after to <HI>Croyden,</HI> who in our Fathers Remembrance, transmitted it by Sale to <HI>Bunce,</HI> and continues still in the Revenue of that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Eastry</HI> gives the Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is seated, and was given to the Church in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> nine Hundred seventy and nine, by King <HI>Egelred,</HI> that is, <HI>Etheldred,</HI> Father to <HI>Edmund Ironside, Et est de Cibo Monachorum,</HI> say the Records of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> that is, it was granted to the Monks for the Support of their Kitchin, and was in the first Intention of the Gift, I believe, invested in the Ecclesiastical Reve∣nue, purposely to expiate that Murder, which was at this place acted upon the Persons of <HI>Ethelbert</HI> and <HI>Etheldred</HI> Brethren of <HI>Egbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> by one <HI>Thunner:</HI> as if that dark Tincture of Guilt, which the effussion of this Royall and Innocent Blood, had stained the earth with, could not have been assoiled without so munificent a Donati∣on. In the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, this Mannor was held by the Monks of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> under the Notion of Seven Plough-lands, nor was it represented un∣der a lesse Bulke in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and was rated in the Whole, in <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book, at Thirty eight Pound, Ten Shillings, and Three-pence.</P>
<P>There was an ancient Tradition that that Altar-Tomb, which was placed at the East-end of the little Chappel, which belonged to <HI>Eastry Court,</HI> was the Sepulchre wherein the Reliques of the two Princes (mentioned before, to have been murdered,) were enshrined: nay it went farther and did affirm that there was a Light hovered con∣stantly about that Tomb, as if the Clearnesse of the Innocence of those who slumbered under that Repository, could not have been manifested better, then by the Beams of such a perpetuate Itradation.</P>
<P><HI>Shrickling</HI> is a Mannor in this Parish which had always the same Possessors with <HI>Knowlton. Thomas Perrot</HI> held it the fourth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 31. By whose Daughter and Heir, it devolved to <HI>Langley,</HI> and from <HI>Langley</HI> by the Heir General to <HI>Peyton:</HI> only I find Sir <HI>Edward Ringley</HI> Knight Marshall of <HI>Callis,</HI> and Bay∣liff of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> both by Water and Land, lived at <HI>Estry,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and enjoyed this Mannor, in Right of his Wife <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Widow of <HI>Edward Langley</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Heronden</HI> in this Parish, was the Seat of a Family known by that Sirname, who bare for his Coat Armour a <HI>Heron</HI> with one <HI>Tallon</HI> erected, and gaping for Breath. One of this Family lay buryed neer the Chancel, in the Time of <HI>Robert Glover Somerset</HI>-Herald, with his Pourtraicture and Coat of Arms in Brasse affixed to the Tombstone: both which by the rude Hand of some sacrilegious Person, are now torn away; yet is the Coat-still extant in very old Rolls and Registers, in the Heralds Office, where the Fa∣mily is called <HI>Heronden</HI> of <HI>Heronden.</HI> Nor is the Name lesse ancient, as appears by Deeds which commence from the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, which related then to this House and Name. In the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, this Family determined in a Female Heir, who was matched to <HI>Boteler</HI> of <HI>Botelers</HI> Fleet in <HI>Ash,</HI> and she annexed this Place to the Patrimony of this Family, in which Name the Title of this Place, hath been e∣ver since successively laid up.</P>
<P><HI>Ewell</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bewsborough,</HI> was a principal Mansion of the Knights Tem∣plers, to which much Land was united, both in this Track, and in <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> where they held the Mannors of <HI>Hony-Child</HI> and <HI>East-Bridge,</HI> as appears by the Book called <HI>Liber de Terris Templariorum,</HI> collected in the year 1130, and kept in the Ex∣chequer. They were founded in the year 1118, in manner following. Cetrain Knights obliged themselves by Vow, in the Hands of the Hands of the Patriarch of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to serve <HI>Christ</HI> after the mannor of Regular Cannons, in Chastiry and Obedience, renouncing their own Wills for ever: they likewise professed to defend the Crosse and Sepulcher of our Saviour from the Eruptions of Infidels, and to secure the
<PB N="149" REF="82"/>high-ways for the Indempnity of Pilgrims, from the Ambushes of Free-booters, that they might more freely visit the place of our Saviours Agony and Crucifixion. They were called Templers, either from their Vow to defend the Temple, or else, from those Lodgings which were assigned them, neer that place, by <HI>Baldwin</HI> the fourth King of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> This order in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, was totally supprest throughout Christendome. The Crimes alledged against them, were Pride, Covetousnesse, for did and unaturall Uncleannesse, and lastly private Collusions and Treaties with Infidels, which tended to the Subversion of the Chris∣tian Cause in <HI>Palestine,</HI> all which they solemnly renownced at their Death, which best interprets their Innocence to future Times: for certainly it was impossible, that an Order which had tyed themselves up, upon their Institution, within the Limitations of so strict a Vow, could universally at one Time, and in all places of the World where they were established, degenerate into those black, horrid and prodigious Crimes, wherewith their Enemies bespattered them. But indeed those who have fathomed the Cause of this their totall Abolition, find, that they were warping with some Compliance too eagerly to a Combination with the Emperour, who was then in Contest with the Pope, about vindicating his temporal power in <HI>Italy,</HI> and else-where, from the unjust enchroachments made upon it by that See. Which his Holyness descrying, wrapt them up in those pre∣tended Crimes, as the Roman Persecutors did the ancient Christians, in the skins of Beasts, that they might more easily be devoured. Upon this their Dissolution, their House here at <HI>Temple Ewell,</HI> was given to the Knights of St. <HI>John</HI> Baptist of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> an Order rather restored then instituted by one <HI>Girardus,</HI> whose Vow was almost coincident in all the Ingredients of it, with that of the Knights Templers. And in their Demeasne did this place lye wound up, untill the finall Dissolution, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then being linked to the Revenue of the Crown it was fixed there untill the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then it was granted to <HI>William Cavendish</HI> Esquire, and he the same year conveyed it to <HI>Christopher Sackvill,</HI> and <HI>Winefrid</HI> his Wife, who about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated it to <HI>John D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niell,</HI> who about the latter end of that Princesse, dying without Issue-male, his Estate here devolved to his two Daughters and Coheirs, matched to <HI>Mab</HI> and <HI>Wiseman,</HI> who both concurred, and by joynt Consent alie∣nated the Propriety of this place, about the beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> to Mr..... <HI>Angell</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> whose Son Mr...... <HI>Angell</HI> of <HI>Crowherst</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> is now entitu∣led to the Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Borestall Banks</HI> in this Parish, was, as high as any Evidences do lead us to discover, part of the ancient Patrimony of the illustrious Family of <HI>Diggs</HI> of <HI>Diggs-Court</HI> in <HI>Barham, John de Digge</HI> of this Family, was Alderman of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the year 1258, and was a great Benefactor to the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> who were newly sea∣ted at <HI>Canterbury:</HI> and purchased for their Support, an Island called <HI>Binnewith,</HI> in that City, and from this <HI>John de Digge,</HI> did descend <HI>Roger de Digge,</HI> who paid respective Aid at the making the Black Prince Knight, for his Lands at <HI>Berham,</HI> and other places in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and dyed seised of this Mannor, in the third year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot Esc.

Briefly, after it had for many Descents, owned the Interest of this Family, it was in the tenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> conveyed away by Sale to <HI>Stokes,</HI> in which Family, the Possession was permanent, untill of very late Time, and then it was alienated to Captain <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Dover.</HI></P>

This Mans Son and Heir was <HI>John Fremingham,</HI> who was one of the Conservators of the Peace of this County, in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the second year of that Prince, and afterwards had the Custody of this County again, in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, but dyed without Issue; so that <HI>Ann</HI> his Sister, matched to <HI>Roger Isley,</HI> of <HI>Sundrich,</HI> became his Heir: and so <HI>Farningham,</HI> was with her, brought to acknowledge the Interest of this Family, from whom it devol∣ved to <HI>John Isley,</HI> whose Widow <HI>Alice Isley,</HI> dyed possest of <HI>Farningham,</HI> in Right of Jointure, in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and from her it devolved to her Son <HI>Thomas Isley,</HI> and he dyed seised of it in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and it was found at his Decease, that it was held in Knights Service of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, by the payment of a Rent-service, of twenty one Shillings <HI>per An.</HI> and had the Estimate of a whole Knights Fee. After him his Son Sir <HI>Henry Isley,</HI> succeeded in the Possession of this place, and being infortunately convicted of high Treason in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary, Farningham</HI> and <HI>Chartons</HI> eschea∣ted to the Crown: and that Princesse, in the same year, granted it back to his Son <HI>William Isley</HI> Esquire, and he in the third and fourth of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> by a Deed enroll'd in Chancery, passes away <HI>Farningham</HI> and the Moiety of <HI>Chartons,</HI> to <HI>William Roper</HI> Esquire, Grandfather to Sir <HI>Anthony Roper,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry Roper,</HI> from whom upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2+ words" DISP="〈◊◊…〉"/> a Will made by his Brother Sir <HI>Anthony Roper,</HI> wherein he demises the Fee-simple to Sir <HI>John Cotton</HI> of <HI>Cambridge-Shire,</HI> it is by Verdict taken away, and enstated on the above mentioned Person.</P>
<P>The other Moiety of <HI>Chartons,</HI> gave Sirname to a Family, who held it as appears by <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. In Times of a lower Descent, it was the Possession of a good old Family, called <HI>Grove∣herst. William de Groveherst</HI> paid respective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight; and from him it devolved to his Successor <HI>Richard Groveherst,</HI> who in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, determined in three Daughters and Coheirs, es∣poused to <HI>Richard Tickhill, Richard Hextall,</HI> and <HI>John Petit,</HI> who about the Begin∣ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, passed one Moiety of it to <HI>John Martin,</HI> whose Successor and Descendant <HI>Edward Martin</HI> above-mentioned, passed it away with <HI>Franks,</HI> men∣tioned in <HI>Horton, Kirkby,</HI> in whose Revenue it lyes now couched, about the be∣ginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to Alderman <HI>Bathurst,</HI> from whom, with <HI>Franks,</HI> it is now de∣volved by Descent, to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Edward Bathurst,.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ralph de Fremingham,</HI> obtained a Weekly Market to his Mannor of <HI>Farningham,</HI> on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly to continue for four Days, the Vigil, the day of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and two days after, by Grant from <HI>Henry</HI> the third in the fifty fifth year of his Reign, <HI>Pat.

<P><HI>Chimbham</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which did give Name to a Family of
<PB N="152" REF="84"/>that Appellation, for I find in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> that when <HI>John de Fremingham,</HI> pays Aid for his Mannors of <HI>Farningham</HI> and <HI>Chimbham,</HI> there is a Recitall of <HI>Lawrence de Chimbham,</HI> which formerly held it in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. But it is evident both by that Record, and by the Inquisition taken after his Death which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: that <HI>John de Freming∣ham</HI> held it, and transmitted it to his Son <HI>Ralph de Fremingham,</HI> whose Son and Heir <HI>John Fremingham,</HI> dying without Issue, <HI>Ann</HI> his Sister entred upon the Possession of this, as his next Heir, and brought it with her to her Husband <HI>Roger Isley</HI> of <HI>Sundridge.</HI> And so this Family became concerned in it, and kept their Interest here until the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was passed away to <HI>Sibill</HI> of <HI>Littlemoat</HI> in <HI>Ainsford:</HI> in which Name the Propriety had not been long wrapt up, when this Family, found its Sepulcher in a Female Heir. For <HI>Ed.

<P><HI>Fairfield</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Langport,</HI> was given to the Church of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by St. <HI>Edm.</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and Chancellor of the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> about the year 1238, and more to fortifie the Donation, affixed his Seal, (<HI>Sigillo suo confirmavit,</HI> say the Records of <HI>Christ-Church</HI>) to the originall Grant. This upon the Suppression, was upon the Institution of the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, confirmed by Grant to them.</P>
<P><HI>Faukham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> was the Seat, and gave the Sirname to an ancient Family called <HI>Faukham.</HI> The first whom I find upon Record is <HI>Walle∣ran de Faukham,</HI> who flourished here in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, as appears by the Book called <HI>Nova Feoffamenta,</HI> taken in that Princes Reign, and kept in the Exchequer. Afterwards in Times of a more modern date it acknowledged the Signory of the Lord <HI>Grandison,</HI> Baron of <HI>Ferneborough,</HI> and <HI>Otho de Grandison,</HI> is said, in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> with <HI>Gilbert de Kirkbie,</HI> to have held one Knights Fee in <HI>Faukham</HI> of the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> which <HI>Rose de Faukham</HI> and <HI>William de St. Clere</HI> of <HI>Ford</HI> in <HI>Wrotham</HI> formerly held, and this <HI>Otho</HI> Lord <HI>Grandison</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

So that his Estate here and in other places, was divided between his Sisters and Coheirs; whereof this, came to be possest by Sir <HI>John Northwood,</HI> in Right of <HI>Agnes</HI> one of his Sisters, from whom by a constant Line of Succession, it was guided down to his Son Sir <HI>Roger Northwood,</HI> who was extinguished in a Female Heir called <HI>Albina Northwood,</HI> matched to <HI>John Diggs</HI> of <HI>Diggs Court</HI> in <HI>Berham</HI> Esquire: who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and so in her Right, this Mannor devolved to this Family, and lay couched in their Estate until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was passed away to <HI>Barham</HI> of <HI>Ber∣ham-Court</HI> in <HI>Teston.</HI> In which Name the Propriety had not been long resident, when <HI>Thomas Barham</HI> Esquire, concluded in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Ann,</HI> who was espoused to Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler,</HI> who cast this into his Revenue, from whom it is now come down to Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler</HI> Baronet, only Son of Sir <HI>William Boteler,</HI> slain at <HI>Cropready</HI> Bridge, in asserting the Royall Quarrell.</P>
<P><HI>Frendsbury</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> hath severall places in it worthy of our Cognisance. The first is <HI>Eslingham,</HI> which was given to the Church of St. <HI>An∣drews</HI> in <HI>Rochester,</HI> by <HI>Kenulfus</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> as the Book called <HI>Textus Roffen∣sis</HI> informs me: But by the Registers of that Church, I find that <HI>John de St. Clere,</HI> held it in Lease of the Covent, about the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and after him a Family called <HI>Neal,</HI> who had large Possessions about <HI>Higham,</HI> were Lessees to the Cloister. In the sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find <HI>John Rykeld</HI> held it, and kept his Shrievalty at this place: after him a Family called <HI>Frogenhall,</HI> was by Right of Lease in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, possest of
<PB N="153" REF="84"/>it, but upon the Suppression of this Monastery of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this Mannor was found to be Lease to <HI>Audley</HI> and <HI>Fisher;</HI> and then the Fee-simple in Reversion was granted to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Crom∣well</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex:</HI> who, being by the Malice of his Enemies, who had raised all their Black Engines of Mischief upon him, aspersed with the Calumnious Re∣proach of high Treason, was attainted in the thirty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and made a Peace-offering to the Fury of his irreconcileable Adversa∣ries; then this, by Escheat, returns back to the Crown; after which that Prince, by his Royall Concession, makes it the Inheritance, of Sir <HI>Will. Drury</HI> of <HI>Nor∣folke,</HI> in which Family it remained, untill Times of our Knowledge and Remem∣brance, and then the Interest was by Sale, translated into <HI>Henry Clerk</HI> Esquire, Serjeant at Law, and late Recorder of <HI>Rochester,</HI> from whom it is now come down to his Son and Heir <HI>Francis Clerk</HI> Esquire, collaterally descended from that eminent Souldier Sir <HI>John Clerk</HI> of <HI>Willoughby</HI> in <HI>Warwick-shire,</HI> who took <HI>Lewis de Orleans</HI> Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> Prisoner, in that memorable Encounter commenced between <HI>Bomy</HI> and <HI>Spours,</HI> Villages not far distant from <HI>Terowan</HI> or <HI>Terwin,</HI> in the fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which was Signally testified by that Prince, when by his Favour and Command, there was annexed this Augmentation to his pater∣nall Coat <HI>viz,</HI> upon a <HI>Canton Azure</HI> a <HI>Demy Ram</HI> Saliant Argent, armed <HI>Or,</HI> between two <HI>Flower de Lis</HI> of the last, over all a <HI>Batton</HI> or <HI>Truncheon</HI> (which intimates to us, that that Captive-Duke, was one of the Marshalls of <HI>France</HI>) <HI>Dexterways</HI> in <HI>Bend,</HI> of the Second.</P>
<P><HI>Chaddington</HI> is a second place of Account, and represents to our Remembrance, the Lords <HI>Cobham,</HI> who were in elder Times, Lords of the Fee. <HI>John de Cobham</HI> dyed seised of it, in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 42. And from this <HI>John,</HI> did it successively flow down to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> who was attainted in the first year of King <HI>James,</HI> upon whose Conviction, this Mannor escheated to the Crown; and that Prince some few years after, granted it to his Kinsman <HI>Lodowick</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox;</HI> but he dying without Issue, it des∣cended to his Nephew <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> lately deceased, whose Dutchesse Dowager during the Minority of the Duke, her Son, holds the present enjoyment of it.</P>
<P><HI>Goddington</HI> is a third place, which calls for our Consideration: It was parcel of the Patrimony of the ancient Family of <HI>Charles. Robert Charles,</HI> who was possest of Land about <HI>Hilden</HI> in <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and was Bailiff of the Forrest or Chase there to <HI>Robert de Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> was seised of it at his Death, which was in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 74. From whom it devolved to <HI>Nicholas Charles,</HI> who dying without Issue in the eleventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Alice</HI> one of his Sisters and Coheirs brought this to be the Inheritance of <HI>William Snaith,</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the ninth year of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, descended from <HI>William de Snaith,</HI> who was made Chancellor of the Kings Exchequer, during Pleasure, in the fifty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: but this Family likewise going out in a Daughter and Heir, she by matching with <HI>Watton,</HI> whose Ancestor held Lands at <HI>Rydley</HI> nere <HI>Ash,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, annexed it to the Incom of that Family, in which Name the Title hath ever since, by an even and permanent Succession resided.</P>
<P><HI>Wainscot</HI> is the last place of any Eminence. It was a Branch which was en∣grafted upon that Demeasne which fell under the Signiory of the <HI>Colepepers</HI> of <HI>Alresford. Walter Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Preston</HI> in that Parish, held it at his Death, which was in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 80. And into the Patrimony of this Family did the Right of it, by a Succession of many Descents, even seem to have bin riveted, having continued constant to this Name, from the a∣bove mentioned <HI>Walter Colepeper,</HI> untill the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Randolph,,</HI> from which Family in Times which were within the Circle of our Fathers Remembrance it passed away by Sale to <HI>Somers,</HI> descended from <HI>William Somer,</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth who held much Land in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> whose Son not many years since passed it away, to Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> of <HI>Rochester.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Frensted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was honored anciently, by being parcel of the Pa∣trimony of the noble Family of <HI>Crombwell,</HI> written so in elder Times, though since a sof∣ter pronunciation hath been quilted into the Name, so that in Times of a more mo∣dern Aspect, it hath been written <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who had here a Seat called now <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> but in elder Orthography written <HI>Mereham</HI> Court. The first of this Family whom I find possest of it, was <HI>John de Crombwell,</HI> who in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, as Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> in his Glossary, in the Word <HI>Ban∣neretus,</HI> cites the Record out of the Office of the <HI>Pell,</HI> was written <HI>Banneret.</HI> Now what these <HI>Bannerets</HI> were, I shall briefly unfold: they were formerly called <HI>Vex∣illiferi,</HI> because their Investiture anciently, was, by delivering to them a <HI>Guidon,</HI> which was nothing but a <HI>Pennon</HI> cut off at the end, which before flowed out into an acute Angle, and now was fashioned and composed into a Square. And as an∣ciently, thirteen Knights Fees, did in the vulgar Estimate, make up a Tenure <HI>per Baroniam;</HI> so did ten Knights Fees compose a <HI>Banneret,</HI> out of which he was (whensoever the Affairs of the Prince did require) to bring into the Field twelve or sixteen Chevaliers or Horsemen, and those Persons of no cheap or inconsidera∣ble Account, but such as could (as Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> notes, <HI>ex Praediis &amp; Peculio proprio</HI>) out of their own Patrimony, Equipp, Horse and furniture of Armes, pro∣portionate to the Service they were to be embarked in.</P>
<P>But to proceed: <HI>Ralph de Crombwell,</HI> Son of the abovesaid <HI>John,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, obtained a Charter of Free-warren, to his Lands here at <HI>Frensted</HI> and <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> but his Family, after the Grant of this Franchise, did not long possesse their Inheritance here; for <HI>Richard de Crombwell,</HI> this mans Son, about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, passed it away to <HI>Hugh Girund,</HI> in whom the Title was as sickle and volatile: for he determining in <HI>Mawd</HI> his Sole Daugh∣ter and Heir, she by matching with <HI>Henry de Chalfhunt,</HI> made it his Patrimony, and he in his Wifes Right, was seised of it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 14. And in this Family, did the Propriety of <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> and other Lands at <HI>Frensted,</HI> continue invested untill the Entrance of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; and then it was passed away to <HI>Hadde,</HI> now called <HI>Hadds,</HI> and <HI>William Hadde</HI> held <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> and the Land annexed to it here at <HI>Frensted</HI> at his Decease, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and in this Family was the Possession constantly resident, untill that Age which fell within the Circle of our Grandfathers Knowledge; and then it was conveyed to <HI>Archer,</HI> from which Family some few years since, it went off by Sale to <HI>Thatcher.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yokes Court</HI> is another ancient Seat in <HI>Frensted,</HI> which, as high as any Beam, either of Publick Record, or private Muniments, can conduct me to a Discove∣ry; I find, acknowledged the noble Family of <HI>Northwood,</HI> and owned the In∣terest of that Family, untill the thirty fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then <HI>Roger de Northwood</HI> dying without Issue-male, bequeathed it to his only Daughter and Heir, <HI>Albina Northwood;</HI> who by matching with <HI>John Digge</HI> of <HI>Diggs Court</HI> in <HI>Berham,</HI> united this Seat to the Interest of that Name and Family, and they to keep Life in her Memory, (a small Preferment beyond the Fate of humane Frailty,) that had improved their Paternal Inheritance with so great a Supplement of Ad∣ditional Estate, erected a fair Monument over her Ashes in <HI>Berham</HI> Church, and adorned it with a French Epitaph, which instructs the Reader, whose Dust sleeps beneath the Marble Repository. Indeed in this Act, this Family seemed to be Corrivalls with the Egyptians, who expended more upon the Structure of their Tombs then Houses, because they knew they were to dwell longer in them. But I have digressed. I now proceed: Thus have you seen how this Seat fell under Signiory of <HI>Diggs,</HI> and the succeeding Records of this Family will inform you, that the Title made its aboad in this Name, untill allmost that Age we call our Fathers; and then it was transmitted by Sale to <HI>Archer,</HI> from whom not many years since, a Fatality like the former, hath now brought it to bee the Possession of <HI>Thatcher.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Feversham</HI> affords a Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed. In the year 812, in the Charter of <HI>Kenulf</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> it is called the Kings little Town. It seems it was of no bigg Dimension then, though it be multiplyed and swolne into a greater Bulk since; yet, as small as it was, <HI>Athelstan</HI> in the year 903, held a publick Moot or great Counsell here, (which Assemblies since the Normans entring here were termed Parliaments) and enacted severall Laws, in this Convention. Probably enough, it belonged to the Crown in elder Times, and was a Mannor-house of the Kings: for <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour (as the Records of St. <HI>Austins</HI> testifie) gave the Advowson of the Church, to that Abby, in the year 1072, and the Mannor it self to a Norman, in Recompence of some signal Ser∣vice. But when King <HI>Stephen,</HI> resolved to erect the Abby there, he compoun∣ded with <HI>William de Ipre</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and gave him the Mannor of <HI>Lilly-Church</HI> in Exchange for it, and his Queen <HI>Matilda,</HI> raised a stately Monastery which she stored with Monks, of the Order of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> which were brought thither by <HI>Clarem∣bald</HI> the first Abbot, from the Abby of St. <HI>Marys</HI> at <HI>Bermondsey</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and procured a Letter to be writ from <HI>Peter Abbot</HI> of that place, to absolve and re∣lease them from all Obedience, to the Order of the <HI>Cluniac's.</HI> And here was K. <HI>Stephen, Matilda</HI> his Wife, and <HI>Eustace</HI> Earl of <HI>Boloign,</HI> his Son, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle solemnly enter'd. Of which for∣mer King it is observed, that though his Reign were rough and tempestuous, by Reason of his perptuall Debates and Contests, with <HI>Mawd</HI> the Empresse and her Son, concerning the Title; yet were there more Religious Convents erected in his Rule then either before or after; which made it appear though the Times were bad they were not impious. And certainly, from the uneven and imperfect Prospect, which those Times folded up in the Flame and Smoak of Civil War, have afforded us of this Prince, and of his Sway of the Scepter, we may conclude that in all things, he was fit to be a King, but that he was one. <HI>Thorne</HI> the Chronicler relates two Contests that happened between the Monks of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> and others: the first was between them and King <HI>John</HI> animated by <HI>Hughbert</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> touching the Right of Patronage, of the Church of St. <HI>Mary Charity</HI> at <HI>Feversham.</HI> The K. apprehending the Advowson of the Church, belonged to him, or at least made to believe so by the Archbishop, presents a Clerk to the Church, and commands his Pre∣sentment should be received, which they not only disobeyed, but ejected the Clerk, and sent diverse of their Monks to maintain the Possession of the Church by strong Hand. Which the King understanding, commanded <HI>Reginald de Cornhill</HI> the Sheriff, to disseise them and restore his presented Clerk, which he in Order to the Kings Injunction, not without a vigorous Resistance by the Monks effected. Upon which, the Monks complain to <HI>Stephen</HI> the Popes Legat, who then was there journeying to <HI>Rome,</HI> and in his Way sojourned at their Cloister. And he com∣passionating their Condition, advised them to send their Prior to <HI>Rome,</HI> least the Power of the See Apostolick might, by this Affront and Inroad upon it, be tram∣pled under Foot. Hereupon the Pope, upon Advertisement received, issues out a Commission to understand the Matter in Debate: But the Monks upon a serious Debate with themselves, knowing the King's impetuous Temper, they found out a more compendious Method for an Accommodation, and presented the King with two Hundred Marks in a Purse, and a meet Palfrey for his Saddle, by which Do∣native they so endeared the K. that they obtained Restitution of their Right, and made him for the future, their gratious Patron.</P>
<P>Another Conflict fell out after this, between the Abbot, and Maior and Burgers of this Town, about some Intrusions and encroachments made by the Townsmen, as was pretended, upon the Franchises of the Church. You may be sure <HI>Thorn</HI> who relates it, is warped with a partial Engagement to his own Fraternity, and with that Caution you may read him. Upon the Dissolution made in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this Mannor with all its Priviledges returned to the Crown, and lay incorporated with its Revenue untill the Reign of King <HI>Charles.</HI> And then it was granted to Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI> of <HI>Chilham</HI> Castle, who not long after setled it on his second Son Mr. <HI>Jo. Digg,</HI> who not long since demised it to Sir <HI>George Sonds</HI> of <HI>Leeze-court.</HI></P>
<PB N="156" REF="86"/>
<P><HI>Fishbourne</HI> in this Parish, is an ancient Mannor, from whence a Family of that Sirname borrowed its Appellation. One <HI>John de Fist bourn</HI> was a Witnesse to that Charter, by which a place called <HI>Messewell</HI> was given to <HI>Feversham</HI> Abby, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second. Afterwards, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find the <HI>Dreylonds</HI> to be possest of it, but their ancient Seat, was at <HI>Cokesditch</HI> in this Parish. For in a Deed dated the twenty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Stephen Dreylond,</HI> whereby he demises some Land in a place called <HI>Crouchfield,</HI> to <HI>William Makenade,</HI> writes himself of <HI>Cokesditch;</HI> and in this Family did the Interest of <HI>Fishbourne</HI> continue, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth. And then it was alienated to <HI>Simons,</HI> to which Name the Title hath remained constantly allied to this Day. Nor was <HI>Cokesditch</HI> fixed in <HI>Dreylond</HI> by a Tenure more permanent, for <HI>katharine</HI> Sole Heir of Sir <HI>Richard Dreylond,</HI> was matched to <HI>Reginald Norton</HI> of <HI>Milton</HI> Esquire, and so with her both the Name and Pro∣priety of this place were entombed in this Family; and this <HI>Reginald</HI> upon his Decease, gave it to his second Son <HI>William Norton,</HI> and from him successively was it transmitted to others of that Line, untill those Times which confined upon our Fathers Remembrance: And then it was alienated to <HI>Parsons,</HI> who was not long seated in his new Acquists, but he conveys it away to <HI>Ashton,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir it is lately transplanted into <HI>Buck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Frittenden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Cranbroke,</HI> resolves it self into several places which call for our Notice. The first is <HI>Comden.</HI> It was clapsed up within the Revenue of the Priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> untill the Storm or Hurricano rather, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, threw it into the Demeasn of the Crown. And then that Prince, in the thirty second year of his Reign, conveyed it by Grant to Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> and he in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, transmitted it by his Deed to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> even in those Times which entrenched on our Remembrance, passed it away to Mr....... <HI>Cleyton</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bewper</HI> is the second place of account in this Parish. It was in elder Times an Appendage or Fragment of that Demeasn, which did contribute to the Support of the Abby of <HI>Feversham,</HI> and upon the Suppression of that Cloister or Seminary, by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was in the thirty fifth year of that Princes Reign, gran∣ted to Sir <HI>Thomas Moil,</HI> who not long after passed it away to <HI>Robert Prat.</HI> And his Son Master <HI>Franci. Prat, primo Elizabethae,</HI> by Fine conveyed it to Mr <HI>Edward Bathurst,</HI> who not many years after, transplanted his Interest here by Sale into Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> Ancestor to Sir <HI>Jo. Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisinghurst</HI> Baronet, who now by pater∣nal Succession, is entituled to the instant Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Wallinghurst</HI> and <HI>Buckhurst</HI> are two petty Mannors, which belonged to the Abby of <HI>Feversham,</HI> but upon the Suppression of that Covent, they were pared off, and by Grant from <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, were enstated upon <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex.</HI> But long he was not endowed with them: for in the thirty second year of that Prince's Government, he was bespattered and blasted with an Accusation of high Treason, which the Subtlety of his Adversaries had woven so closely together that he was entangled in it; and being attainted, forfeited both his Life and Estate to the Fury, I cannot say Justice, of an incensed Prince: Amongst the Ruines of his Patrimony, these two places were comprehended, and upon his Shipwrack it returned to the Crown. And then King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by a new Grant in the same year they escheated, passed them away to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisingherst</HI> in <HI>Cranebroke,</HI> from whom they are now come down to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, his Successor.</P>
<P><HI>Upper Peasridge</HI> was involved in that spatious Inheritance, which fell under the Dominion of the Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> of whom I shall speak more at <HI>Leeds,</HI> and when he by his Disloyalty had forfeited both Life and Fortune to the Crown, this was enwrapt in the Escheat. But was restored in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer</HI> this Mans Son, and he in the twelfth year of that Prince, held it at his Death, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 44. But <HI>Giles</HI> his only Son dying without Is∣sue, his great Estate was split into parcells, and this with some more of his Demeasne
<PB N="157" REF="86"/>was allotted to <HI>Mawd</HI> his Sister and Coheir, who was matched to <HI>John Vere</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and he in her Right was possest of it at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 84. And in this Family did it reside untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was passed a∣way by Sale to <HI>St. Leger,</HI> to whose Patrimony it remained annexed untill the Go∣vernment of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary;</HI> and then an Alienation like the former, brought it over to <HI>Lone,</HI> descended from the <HI>Lones</HI> of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where there is yet a House of the Name: and being thus fixt in this Family, the Possession continues still united to it.</P>
<P><HI>Fordwich</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>West-Gate,</HI> was given to the Abbot and Monks of St. <HI>Austins</HI> (as the Annalls of that Convent testifie) by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and was given <HI>ad Vestitum,</HI> for Reparation of their Apparell. And there is a Tra∣dition, that <HI>Hemp-Hall</HI> which was an Appendage to this Mannor, did pay a quit-Rent in Hemp: but certainly it must be then for the use of those secular persons which related as Officers and Servants to this Cloister; for the Monks themselves being under the Rule of <HI>Bennet,</HI> harrowed their Skin with Shirts of Hair, and slept <HI>vestiti</HI> in their Apparell, the more to tame and controle the Mutinies and Dis∣orders of the Flesh. But to advance: After this Mannor (which the Piety of for∣mer Ages had planted in the Revenue of the Church) had for a large Decursion of Time owned no other Proprietary; it was by the Dissolution in the twenty ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, emptied into the Income of the Crown, where it lay, untill <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth in the seventh year of his Reign, granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> and he not long after alienated his Concernment in it to <HI>John Johnson,</HI> from whom it came over by Purchase to <HI>Paramour,</HI> who passed it away to the Lady <HI>Elizabeth Finch,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>Moile Finch,</HI> whose Son <HI>Thomas Finch</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> almost in our Memory passed it away to <HI>John Finch</HI> Baron of <HI>Ford∣wich,</HI> late Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> in the year 1640, and in him does the instant Signory of it reside.</P>
<P><HI>Folkstone</HI> does contribute a Name to the Hundred in which it is situated. The Mannor it self with the Mannor of <HI>Walton,</HI> was given to the Nunnery by <HI>Eadbald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> which it seems was of that Repute in those Times, that <HI>Eanswide</HI> his Daughter was there vailed a Nun, under the Rule of St. <HI>Bennet;</HI> and <HI>Ermen∣red</HI> and <HI>Ercombert</HI> his Sons, changed their hopes of a Crown, into those of one more celestiall, and folded up all their Earthly Glories in a Monastick Cowle, which they assumed at this place, under the Discipline of St. <HI>Bennet.</HI> But this Cloister was some Ages after, partly by the Fury of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and partly by the Impressions of the Sea, reduced into a heap of Ruines: so that in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, <HI>William de Muneville</HI> laid the Foundations of a new Priory in another place of the Town; which was much augmented afterwards by <HI>William de Averenches,</HI> who had married his only Daughter. But it seems upon the former Devastation of this religious Seminary, the Mannor had returned to the Crown: for in the year one thousand thirty and eight, <HI>Canutus</HI> restored to <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> (as the Records of that Covent do intimate) this Mannor of <HI>Folkston;</HI> which <HI>Athelstan,</HI> Son of King <HI>Edward,</HI> in the year nine hun∣dred twenty and eight, had formerly granted to them for the health of his Fa∣thers Soul, and to the Honor of <HI>Ʋlfhelme</HI> Arch-priest of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but with this Restriction, he limits and bounds this his Concession, that this Mannor thus returned to the Church, should never be alienated by the Arch-bishop without the Consent of the King and the Covent of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> who, it appears, joyned with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour and the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and fastned it a∣gain to this Priory, where it remained, untill it was torn away by the Suppression, in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and annexed to the Crown: Afterwards that Prince, in the thirtieth year of his Reign, transplanted his Interest in it and <HI>Wal∣ton,</HI> by Grant into <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> and he the same year passed them away to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who being attainted in the thirty second year of the abovesaid Prince: the Propriety of <HI>Folkston</HI> and <HI>Walton,</HI> returned to
<PB N="158" REF="87"/>the Crown, and resided in the Royal Patrimony, untill the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and then they were regranted to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> abovesaid, who not long after conveyed them to Mr. <HI>Henry Herdson,</HI> whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>Francis Herdson,</HI> alienated them to his Uncle Mr. <HI>John Herdson,</HI> about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and he upon his Decease (without any lawfull Issue,) gave them to his Nephew, Sir <HI>Basill Dixwell</HI> Knight and Baronet, descended from the ancient Family of <HI>Dixwell</HI> in the North-riding of <HI>York-shire.</HI> Who likewise making his Ex∣it without any lawful Issue, <HI>Mark Dixwell</HI> Esquire his Nephew became his Heir, and from him is the Propriety of both these places descended to his Son and Heir, <HI>Ba∣sill Dixwell</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>The Nunnery of <HI>Folkston</HI> abovesaid, being much defaced, was in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, reedified and reestablished by <HI>John de Clinton,</HI> and <HI>John de Se∣grave,</HI> and <HI>Julian</HI> his Wife; which was upon this second Erection stored with Nuns, who were to live as formerly, under the Rule of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> and dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Eanswith.</HI> But when it was found, in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, that it related by forrein Dependance to the Abby of <HI>Lolley</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> it was by that prudent and cautious Monarch Supprest.</P>
<P>There were five Churches anciently in <HI>Folkston,</HI> three of which were dedicated to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul;</HI> all which and one more, whose Name is not now obvious, were long since by the Assaults of the Elements, and Devastations of men, utterly dismantled: only that which was erected in the year 1095. by <HI>Nigellus de Muneville,</HI> and devoted to St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Eanswith,</HI> hath been too hard a Morsel for the teeth of Time to consume.</P>
<P><HI>Folkston</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to be held here weekly on the Thursday, by the Mediation of <HI>Geffrey Fitz-Peter,</HI> in the sixth year of King <HI>John,</HI> which was confirmed to <HI>William de Averenches,</HI> in the sixteenth year of the above∣said Prince, and renewed to Sir <HI>John Segrave,</HI> in the twenty second year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third.</P>
<P><HI>Richard</HI> the second granted to Sir <HI>John Clinton,</HI> that a Market should be ob∣served weekly at <HI>Folkston,</HI> on the Wednesday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil, and Day of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 13. <HI>Richardi secundi Membr.</HI> 14. <HI>Pars</HI> 2.</P>
<P><HI>Eabald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> about 1000 years since, built a Castle at the South part of this Town of <HI>Folkston,</HI> which being shrunk into Decay, <HI>William de Averenches</HI> erected a Fort in the year 1068, on the Foundation of the formerly demolished Pile, whose ruinous Shell or Skeleton is yet visible,</P>
<P>I have seen a Leafe by some injurious Hand torn out from the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Folkston,</HI> which sets forth the entertainment which the Family of <HI>Poynings</HI> were to have, when they came to hear Masse at the Priory; a subtle Artifice used by the Monks of that Age, to catch the Benevolence of the noblest and most opulent Families of the Nation, that certainly (had not the Statute of Mortmain, or Law of Amorti∣zation made in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, restrained and contracted the unlimited Bounty of the Laity to these religious Cloisters,) almost all the Land which was of secular Interest, had been ingulphed in the Revenue of the Church: so that as one well observes this over-active and operative Devotion, would have dedicated all to God, and have left Little or Nothing to have given to <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Terlingham</HI> and <HI>Ackhanger,</HI> were the Patrimony as high as the Reign of the Conquerour (as Doomsday instructs us) of <HI>William de Muneville,</HI> the Repairer and Restorer, if not Founder and Establisher of <HI>Folkston</HI> priory. By whose Daughter and Heir they devolved to <HI>William de Averenches,</HI> who had Issue <HI>William de Ave∣renches,</HI> in whom the male-line failed, so that <HI>Matilda de Averenches</HI> his Sole Heir by matching with <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> Baron <HI>Leeds</HI> Castle, made them parcel of his Demeasne: who by his Addition, so swelled his Estate, that he was styled the great Lord of <HI>Kent,</HI> and was of that Esteem in this County, that by a generall Consent and Councell of the Barons of the Cinque-ports, the Custody of the Sea-Coast from <HI>Hastings</HI> to <HI>Pool,</HI> was committed to his Care and Inspection, <HI>Pat.</HI> 19. <HI>Hen. tertii Memb.</HI> 14. And he held these Mannors at his Death, which was in the forty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 33. And left them to
<PB N="159" REF="87"/>his Son <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> who was enwrapt in the Faction and Rebellion of <HI>Simon de Montfort</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> raised against <HI>Henry</HI> the third; but was, by that Act of Oblivion and Clemency, styled <HI>Dictum de Kenilworth,</HI> passed by that Prince in the fiftieth year of his Reign, called to <HI>Mercie,</HI> and to most part of his Estate, excepting <HI>Leeds-Castle, Bersted, Chetham,</HI> and some other peices, but dyed without Issue; so that <HI>Eleanor</HI> matched to <HI>Bertram de Crioll, Juliana</HI> first matched to <HI>Nicholas de Sandwich,</HI> and secondly to <HI>Roger de Segrave,</HI> and two o∣thers who were wedded to <HI>Lenham,</HI> and <HI>Pateshull,</HI> became, as they were his four Sisters, his four Coheirs. And upon the partition of the Estate, these two Man∣nors came over to be the Patrimony of <HI>Crioll,</HI> and <HI>Bertram de Crioll</HI> above men∣tioned held them at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 48. And left them to <HI>John</HI> his only Son, who dying Childlesse, <HI>Joan</HI> his Sister matched to Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> became his Heir: but he determining likewise in a Female Heir called <HI>Joan,</HI> she by espousing Sir <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> Father of <HI>Michaell de Poynings</HI> of <HI>Terlingham,</HI> raunged these places under the Demeasn of that Family, in which they remained, untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh: and then Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> gave them in Dower, with <HI>Mary</HI> his natural Daughter to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> whose Son <HI>Edw.</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by Sale passed them away to <HI>Herdson,</HI> from whom by Testament they came over to <HI>Dixwell,</HI> in which Family the Possession of them is still permanent.</P>
<P><HI>Morehall</HI> is a small Mannor in this Parish, to which, <HI>William de Valentia</HI> obtained a Charter of Priviledges, in the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. After him I find the <HI>Morehalls</HI> to be Possessors of it, who ingrafted their own Name upon it, and <HI>John de Morehall,</HI> paid respective Aid, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for his Mannor of <HI>Morehall,</HI> in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After this Family was extinct, the <HI>Bakers</HI> of <HI>Caldham,</HI> about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, were invested in the Possession, and not many years after, <HI>Brandred</HI> by one of the Coheirs of <HI>Baker,</HI> became Lord of the Fee: from which Family, by Sale, it passed away to Sir <HI>Thomas Brown,</HI> from whom descended Sir <HI>Mathew Brown</HI> Knight, who in our Grand-fathers Memory conveyed his Right in it to <HI>Godman,</HI> who is still Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Hope-House</HI> in <HI>Folkston,</HI> belonged to the <HI>Houghams,</HI> a noble and knightly Fami∣ly inhabiting at <HI>Hougham</HI> not far distant, and <HI>Robert de Hougham</HI> dyed seised of it in the forty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, I find the <HI>Clintons</HI> possest of it, and <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> dyed seised of it in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: and from him it descended to his Kinsman <HI>John de Clinton,</HI> great Grandfather to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, sold it away to <HI>Davis,</HI> from which Family by a Daughter, and partly by Purchase: it came over to <HI>Lessington,</HI> and he in our Fathers Remembrance, alienated his Concernment in it to <HI>Hopday,</HI> whose Son is the instant Possessor of it.</P>
<P><HI>Bredmer</HI> or <HI>Berdmer,</HI> is the last place worthy any Consideration. It is partly situ∣ated in <HI>Folkston,</HI> and partly in <HI>Cheriton;</HI> that there was a Family of this Name, was most certain. For in ancient Deeds and Court Rolls of <HI>Valoigns,</HI> who was Lord of <HI>Che∣riton</HI> after <HI>Scotton:</HI> I find frequent mention of severall of this Name, who held Land of this Family. But in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> I find <HI>William de Brockhull</HI> held the fourth part of a Knights Fee in <HI>Cheriton,</HI> which was this, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. From this Name by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Heir of <HI>Thomas Brock∣hull,</HI> it came to be the possession of <HI>Richard Selling</HI> Esquire, and here it rested untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was passed away to <HI>Edmund Inmith,</HI> a Retainer to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who gave it to his second Son <HI>Edmund Inmith,</HI> and he was extinguished in two Daughters and Coheirs: one was married to <HI>Reyner,</HI> and the other to <HI>Baker,</HI> who in her Right shared this place, and in the Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> passed it away by Sale to <HI>Ben,</HI> who holds the instant Possession of it.</P>

<P>You may find mention of <HI>Walkelme Magminot,</HI> in the Catalogue of the Lord Wardens. But the Daughter and Heir of this Line, was married to <HI>Say,</HI> from whom it came to be called <HI>Says-Court,</HI> which Name it still retaineth: And was by reason of the Commodiousnesse of the Meadows belonging to it, and Stalls there erected, made a place, in the Time of the late King, for feeding Sheep and Oxen, served by Composition for the Kings House.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> held the Mannor of <HI>West-Greenwich,</HI> and one Messuage in <HI>Deptford, Anno</HI> 29. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. by <HI>West-Greenwich,</HI> which was ment by that which we now call <HI>Deptford Strand:</HI> and by <HI>Deptford,</HI> is ment the upper Town, where a fair strong Stone Bridge, lately erected, doth acknowledge the sole Royal bounty of K. <HI>Charles,</HI> by this Inscription.</P>
<P>This Bridge was re-edified at the only charge of King <HI>Charles,</HI> in the fourth year of his Reign, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1628. In former Times it w as repaired at the Charge of the Contry adjacent. For I find by a Record in the <HI>Tower. Esc

<P>The Treasurer of the Navy, hath here a commendable and convenient House for his Residence at the Dock, to view the building and repayring the States Ships and what is most expedient for the Manufacture of Cordage, Anchors, and other Provisions for Ships, by which means the Town is so greatly increased in small Tenements, and the Statute for Cottages, excepting Market-Towns, and such pla∣ces as are used for building of Ships, that for number of Inhabitants and Com∣municants, it may compare with diverse Counties in the Kingdome: which great Increase of the Parish, caused them to new build another Isle on the North-side the Church, to which the East-Indian Company of Merchants were good Bene∣factors, And the Chancel enlarged with beautifull Additions, partly at the Cost of Sir <HI>William Russell</HI> Knight and Baroner, Treasurer of the Navy, and the cir∣cumspection of Doctor <HI>Valentine,</HI> the late learned and worthy Incumbent of the place.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to the Church, The Company of Navigators and Seamen, incorpo∣rated by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, have a Hall or House for their meetings and Consultations. Certainly the use of this Society, is most considerable and com∣mendable: for the Common-wealth, upon all Occasions, may from them receive necessary Intelligence of all the Roads, Waterings, Depths, and Conveniences, of most part of the Maritime places in the Known World.</P>
<P>One thing more I have to mention: and that is <HI>Hacham,</HI> which was, in K. <HI>Hen.</HI> the seconds Time, the Seat of <HI>Hacham,</HI> lying upon the Confines of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Kent-fields</HI> or <HI>Kent-lands,</HI> within this County; as <HI>Kent-Hatch</HI> in <HI>Westerham,</HI> is the very out-side of this Shire: As that place towards <HI>Surrey,</HI> called <HI>Kent-House,</HI> designs the Bounderies of this County, between <HI>Bekenham</HI> and <HI>Croydon.</HI> Divers Inqui∣sitions, taken since that time, have found <HI>Hacham</HI> to be in <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>And I believe the Mannor of <HI>Bredingherst,</HI> before mentioned, was formerly in this Shire, which is now slipt into <HI>Surrey</HI> at <HI>Peckham Rey,</HI> in <HI>Camberwell.</HI> The Reception of Prisoners, from the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> being for a good Space u∣sed to be at <HI>New Cross,</HI> hath begot an opinion, that there was the out-side of <HI>Kent:</HI> but those that will justly denote the <HI>Ambitus</HI> and Bounds, must not think it begins at <HI>Kent-street,</HI> because it is so called of the Road-way into <HI>Kent.</HI> Nor that <HI>Kentish Town</HI> by <HI>High-gate,</HI> is part of this Shire, though it pertake of the Customes of Gavel-kind. Nor at Sir <HI>Thomas Waterings,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kanc. Inq. 7. R. 2. n. 30. post Mort. E. fillii Tho.

<P>In the forty third of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it appears, that the Mannor of <HI>Hachesham,</HI> was granted to the Prioresse of <HI>Dertford,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caus. 43. E, 3. M. 6.</NOTE> and many parcels of Land that came by Escheat, as held of that Mannor, lying in <HI>Surrey,</HI> after the Death of <HI>Jo.</HI> the Son of <HI>Jo. Adam,</HI> were confirmed to that Foundation by the King: all which returning into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, upon the publike Suppression, this Mannor, with its Appendages, was for ever setled by the Crown, on the Company or Brother-hood of the <HI>Haberdashers</HI> in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>East-Greenwich</HI> is the next Town to <HI>Detford,</HI> so called, because it standeth more East-ward then the other, formerly spoken of. In Latin named <HI>Viridis Sinus,</HI> in Saxon <HI>Grenawic,</HI> that is, the Green Town, upon the Turning Creeke of the Ri∣ver.</P>
<P>In the Time of the <HI>Danes</HI> Invasion, they often made their Road at this place, and made it remarkable, by their Cruelty, shewed unto <HI>Ealphege</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury:</HI> whom in the year of our Lord, a thousand and twelve, they cruelly executed with most exquisite Torments, whose Death together with the cause there∣of <HI>Ditmarius Mersepurgius,</HI> who about the same time lived, hath thus, in the eighth Book of his Chronicles described. I understood (saith he) by the relation of
<PB N="162" REF="89"/><HI>Sewald,</HI> a pitifull Deed, and therefore memorable, namely, that the perfidious Crew of Norman Souldiers, under <HI>Thurkill,</HI> as yet their Captain, took that excellent Prelate, Arch-bishop of the Citty of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> named <HI>Ealphege,</HI> with the rest, and them after their wicked manner imprisoned and bound, yea and put him to endure Famine, and unspeakable pains. This good man moved with humane Frailty, promiseth unto them a Summe of Money, and for the obtaining there∣of, did set down a Time between. That if in this Space, he could not by some acceptable Ransome, escape this momentary Death, he might yet in the mean while purge himself with many a Grone, to be offered as a lively Sacrifice unto the Lord.</P>
<P>But when as the Time and space appointed were come and gon, this greedy Gulph of Pirats, called forth the Servant of the Lord, and in threatning-wise demand this Tribute promised unto them, to be speedily and out of hand paid. Then he, as a Meek lamb, Here am I, quoth he; ready to undergo, (even for the Love of Christ) whatsoever ye presume now to do against me, that I may deserve to become an example of his Servants: and nothing am I troubled at this day. And whereas I seem unto you a Lyer, it is not my own Will, but great need and Poverty that hath done it: This body of mine, which in this Exile I have loved over much, I present as culpable unto you; and I know it is in your Power, to do with it what yee intend: but my sinfull Soul, that regardeth not you, I hum∣bly commend to the Creator of all things. As he was thus speaking, the whole Rabble of these prophane Wretches hemmed him round about, and getteth to∣gether diverse and sundry weapons to kill him: which when their Leader <HI>Thurkill</HI> saw a far off, he came quickly running, and crying, do not so I beseech you, and here with my whole heart, I deliver unto you all my Gold and Silver, and whatsoever I have here, or can by any means come by, save my Ship only, that you would not sin against the Lord's annointed. But this unbridled anger of his Mates harder then Iron and Flint, was nothing mollified with so gentle Words, and fair Lan∣guage of his, but became only pacified by shedding his innocent blood, which present∣ly they altogether confounded and bleanded with Ox-heads, Stons as thick as Hail, and Billets hurled at him.</P>
<P>And to the memory of this said <HI>Ealphege,</HI> is the Parish Church here consecrated. But far more splendid hath this sumptuous Pallace been, ever since <HI>Humphrey Duke</HI> of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> Brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, builded the same, and called it <HI>Placence;</HI> And likewise the Castle, and inclosed the Park: For doing them both, he had the King's Charter XI. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>Rex concedat quod Humfridus Dux Glocestriae, &amp; Elianora uxor ejus, possdent Karnellare Manerium suum de East-Grenwich, &amp; Impar∣care</HI> CC. <HI>Acras terrae inter Manerium suum praedictum.</HI> For it was not lawfull for any man to fortifie his House, or raise a Castle or place of Defence without Licence from the Crown, for Fear of inward Sedition: and was therefore inqui∣rable before the Escheator in the twenty fourth Article of his Office. <HI>Item de Castellis &amp; Dominicis Karnellatis sine Regis licencia.</HI> The word having its deriva∣tion from <HI>Charneux,</HI> whichin French signifieth the indented Form of the Top of a Wall, which hath vent and crest, commonly called Imbattelling, because it was very serviceable in fight to the Defendant within, who might at the loops or lower places, and other cranies in the Walls and Bulworkes, annoy the Enemy, that as∣sayled the same, and might also shroud himself under the higher Parts thereof.</P>
<P>Afterward King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, bestowed some cost, to enlarge this work. <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, followed and beautified the House, with the Addition of the Brick Front to the water side. But King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, as he exceeded all his Progenitors in setting up sumptuous Houses, so he spared no Cost in Garnishing <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> in the time of King <HI>James,</HI> builded that new Brick-work towards the Garden, and laid the Foundation of the House of Delight, towards the Park, which Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> hath so finished and furnished, that it far surpasseth all other of that kind in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In Memory of the many Camps that have been here, Certain places within this Parish, are called <HI>Combes,</HI> namely <HI>East-Combe,</HI> where that godly good Gen∣tleman
<PB N="163" REF="89"/><HI>William Lambert</HI> Esquire dwelt, that gave us the first Description of this Country, in his Perambulation, and made this work the more easy to any, that should endevour further Progresse therein; <HI>Facile est inventis addere, difficile inve∣nire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Westcombe</HI> with its Appendant Members, related to the noble Family of <HI>Bade∣lesmer,</HI> and upon the Attainder of <HI>artholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> escheating to the Crown, they lay clasped up in its Revenue; untill King <HI>Richard</HI> the second gran∣ted them to Sir <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> the Judge; upon whose Attainder, they were gran∣ted in Fee to <HI>Robert Ballard</HI> Esquire <HI>Pincernae suo</HI> his grand Boteler. That is the Man∣nors of <HI>Westcombe,</HI> and <HI>Spittlecombe</HI> in <HI>Greenwich,</HI> two Watermills in <HI>Detford,</HI> with their Appurtenances in <HI>Charlton</HI> and <HI>Writle-mersh,</HI> after which that Name, conti∣nued a long time in this place, of whom you may read more among the Sheriffs of <HI>Kent,</HI> untill about the fourth of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary, Westcombe</HI> was altenated by <HI>Nicholas Ballard,</HI> to <HI>John Lambert</HI> Esquire, whose Successor <HI>Thomas Lambert,</HI> not many years since, alienated it to <HI>Hugh Forth:</HI> from whom it is lately gon over by Sale, to Mr...... <HI>Biddulph</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the Conquest, this <HI>Greenwich,</HI> was parcell of the Possessions of the Bishop of <HI>Liseux</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and bore Service, to <HI>Odo</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Baieux,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent.</HI> After, the Mannor belonged to the Abbot of St. <HI>Petres</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> till such time, as King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, seising in∣to his Hands (by occasion of War) the lands of the Priors Aliens, bestowed it together with the Mannor of <HI>Lewsham,</HI> and many other Lands also, upon the Priory of the Brotherhood to the Monks of <HI>Shene</HI> which he had then newly erected, to which it remained till the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, who annexed it to the Crown, unto which it now belongeth, and is called the Honor <HI>East-Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> were both born here; and King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, a Miracle of Princely Towardnesse, ended his Life, in the same House.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, 1376, in the fifty first year of his Reign founded the Religious House of Friers Aliens, or Dominican Friers. Sir <HI>John Norbury</HI> Knight, high Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> is reckoned a Benefactor to the same, after the Disso∣lution of this House, and its Annexion to <HI>Shene</HI> by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P>Another House of observant Friers was erected here, by King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, as we read in <HI>Jo. Rosse. Circiter Annum Regni Edwardi quarti, venerunt Fratres ob∣servantes Ordinis Minorum ad Greenwich, &amp; habebant Cantariam &amp; Capellam Sancti Crucis.</HI> And King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, builded that House for them adjoyning to the Pallace, which is yet there to be seen.</P>
<P>There are moreover in the Town, two Colledges or Almes houses, for the Susten∣tation of poor Persons, the one builded by <HI>William Lambert</HI> Esquire, which he named the Colledge of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> poor People, and as the Prying Adver∣saries of out Religion then observed, was the first Protestant that built an Hos∣pital.</P>
<P>The other standing by <HI>Thames</HI>-side, was founded by <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> Lord Privy Seal, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Knight of the Garter. And inlarged and Beautified the Castle, (which is famous in the Spanish Fables) from whence there is a most fair and pleasant Prospect open to the Ri∣ver, winding in and out, almost redoubling of it self, the green Medows and Marshes underlying the Citty of <HI>London,</HI> and Country round about. Described by <HI>Berkley</HI> in his <HI>Euphormio.</HI></P>
<P>And also for a <HI>L'env'oy</HI> to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> you may read the Verses of <HI>Leland</HI> the <HI>Anti∣quarian</HI> Poet adjoyning to <HI>Greenwich. Blackheath,</HI> of which the Hundred taketh the name, so called of the colour of the Earth, or Bleacheath of the high and cold Situation, for bleak signifieth cold. Also <HI>Campus Martis,</HI> it may well be cal∣led: for besides the Burthen of the Danish Camps, it hath born three rebellious Assemblies. One in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, Moved, as shall be farther declared in <HI>Offham,</HI> by <HI>John Tylar,</HI> whom <HI>William Walworth,</HI> then Maior of <HI>London,</HI> slew with his Dagger in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and thereupon, upon the Tradition
<PB N="164" REF="90"/>comes, that the City had given them, for an Augmentation to their <HI>Eschochen,</HI> a Dag∣ger in the Dexter-point or Canton, so to be born by them for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Cade</HI> that Counterfeit <HI>Mortimer,</HI> and his Crew, conducted the second, who araying themselves here, and passed to <HI>London,</HI> where they did to Death the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and others, and executed their malice upon the Records and Monuments of the Law; Burning down the Office of Armes, which was then kept at <HI>Cole-Harbour,</HI> burning, destroying their Rolls, Registers, and Books of Armory; Their main Drift and Design, being to bring in Parity.</P>
<P>And their Insurrection was here assembled, by <HI>Michaell Joseph</HI> Black-smith, and the Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> under the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; at which time they and their Complices received their just Desert: the Common Numbers of them, being discomfited and slain, and the Leaders themselves, taken, drawn and hanged.</P>
<P>Of this last, there remaineth yet, to be seen upon the Heath, the place of the Smith's Tent, called commonly his Forge; and of all, there the great grave-Hills of such as were buryed, after the overthrow. These Hills, in the West-Country, upon diverse Champions and Plains (where is no small Store of the Like) are called <HI>Barowes,</HI> of the old English word <HI>Burghes;</HI> which last word, melted into Buryings, (being a Spring of the old Stock) we do yet retain alive.</P>
<P>The first and last of these Commotions were stirred of Griese, the Common people conceived for the Demand of two Subsidies. Of which the one was un∣reasonable, because it was taxed upon the Polls, and exempted none. The other was unseasonable, for that it was exacted, when the heads of the common people were full of <HI>Perkin Warbeck.</HI></P>
<P>The third and middlemost, grew upon a grudge, that the People took for yielding the Dutchie of <HI>Aniou,</HI> and <HI>Maine,</HI> to the King of <HI>Sicily:</HI> The coming of whose Daughter, (after that the King would needs have her to Wife, notwithstanding, his precontract made with the Earl of <HI>Armenac</HI>) was not so joyfully embraced, by the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> upon <HI>Blackheath,</HI> wearing their red Hoods, Badges, and blew Gowns, as in Sequele the Marriage and whole Government it self, was known to be detested of the Country Commons, by bearing in the same place, Harnesse, Bowes, Bills, and other Weapons. Thus far, the Story of <HI>Blackheath</HI> proves but sad and tragical: That which remains, is of a more glorious and splendid condi∣tion, consisting of Ovations and Triumphs; for when the Emperour of <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI> came to require Aid against the Turks, King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, with all Princely respect, went to meet him at this place, and so conducted him to <HI>London.</HI> And when King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, returned from his victorious Conquest of <HI>France,</HI> the Lord Maior and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> went forth in their best Equi∣page, to attend his Reception at this place, at which time the King made many Knights Bannerets; And K. <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, that excelled in all Triumphal matters met <HI>Anne Cleve,</HI> daughter to the Dake of <HI>Cleve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Graveney</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Boughton,</HI> was in the year of our Lord eight hun∣dred and eleven, by Archbishop <HI>Ʋlfred,</HI> bought of King <HI>Kenwolfe,</HI> (as the Book of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> sets it forth,) <HI>ad opus Ecclesiae Christi,</HI> to the repair of the Cathe∣dral. In the year of <HI>Grace</HI> eight hundred and thirty, <HI>Werhardus</HI> a Priest of much Power in <HI>England,</HI> (by the injunction of the Arch-bishop) gave <HI>Graveney</HI> to the Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> which had been before snatched away, and then passed under the Notion of thirty two Hides; and if you will see how it was rated, in <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book, it is thus there represented: <HI>Graveney, est Manerium Monachorum, &amp; est de Vestitu eorum, quod Richardus Constabularius tenet in Feodo de Archiepiscopo, &amp; tamen reddit firmam Monachis, &amp; pro</HI> 1 <HI>Sulling se defen∣dit.</HI> This Mannor by the Successive Proprietaries, was held in Fee, of the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>Here was a Family called <HI>Gravenell,</HI> who were Lords of this Mannor, which <HI>John de Gravenell,</HI> dyed possest of, in the fifty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. Afterwards I find the <HI>Fevershams,</HI> a Family so called, held it. <HI>Richard Feversham</HI> was seised of it at his Death, which was in the thirteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.
<PB N="165" REF="90"/>Esc. Num.</HI> 100. But deceased without Issue-male, so that his only Daughter <HI>Joan</HI> matched to <HI>John Boteler</HI> became his Heir. This <HI>John Boteler,</HI> was high Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the twenty second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second. But dyed likewise with∣out Issue-male, so that his Estate here, which devolved to him by Female Right, by the same Fate, was carried away to <HI>John Martin,</HI> one of the Judges of the Common-Pleas, who married <HI>Ann</HI> his Sole Heir, and this Man lyes buryed in <HI>Graveney</HI> Church, under a Fair Stone inlaid with Brasse, and his Pourtraicture insculped thereon, with this Inscription affixed. <HI>Hîc jacet Joannes Martin, Justi∣ciarius de communi Banco, qui obiit</HI> 24 <HI>Octobris,</HI> 1436, <HI>&amp; Anna Uxor ejus.</HI>From <HI>Martin,</HI> the Propriety of that Estate here, which had been diverse years entitu∣led to this Name, went by Purchase into <HI>Pordage</HI> of <HI>Rodmersham,</HI> in which Family the Possession hath for several Generations been constantly resident.</P>
<P><HI>Gravesend</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Toltingtrow,</HI> was anciently the Possession of a Fa∣mily called <HI>Cramavill,</HI> who had likewise very considerable Possessions in <HI>East-Kent. Henry de Cramavill,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the fifty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 8. And <HI>Joan,</HI> Wife, I believe, of <HI>Henry de Cra∣mavill,</HI> was seised of it at her Decease, which was in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 53. After this Family was gon out, I find the Lord of the Fee, to be <HI>Reginald de Cobham,</HI> who was in Possession of it at his Death, which was in the forty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 15. and in Ages of a lower Step, another <HI>Reginald Cobham,</HI> was seised of it, in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth: and from him, by the Heir Generall it came down, to <HI>Bray∣brook:</HI> and by the Heir general of that Family, it was transmitted to <HI>Brook,</HI> of the County of <HI>Somerset,</HI> from whom descended the infortunate <HI>Henry Brook,</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> who being attainted in the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> forfeited this Mannor to the Crown: in whose Revenue it lay involved, untill the late K. <HI>Charles</HI> granted it to his Kinsman <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> upon whose late Decease, it is now become the Inheritance of his Son <HI>Esme</HI> Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> now in his Minority.</P>
<P><HI>Milton</HI> neer <HI>Gravesend,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> was an Ingredient which made up that Estate, which fell under the Signory of the <HI>Montchenseys,</HI> Lords and Barons of <HI>Swanscamp. Warren de Montchensey,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Milton,</HI> in the thirty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and he had Issue <HI>William de Montchensey,</HI> who held it at his Death, which was in the fifty se∣cond year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third: and left it to <HI>Dionis</HI> his Female Inheritrix, wed∣ded to <HI>Hugh de Vere,</HI> by whom she having no Issue, that might transmit the Possession to his Family; the Interest of it was, by <HI>Joan,</HI> Sister and Coheir of the abovementioned <HI>William,</HI> knit to the Patrimony of her Husband, <HI>Aymer de Valence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke;</HI> whose Son <HI>William de Valence</HI> dying without Issue, <HI>Isabell</HI> his Sister and Coheir, being wedded to <HI>Lawrence de Hastings,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Pem∣broke,</HI> united it to his Demeasn, and his Grandchild <HI>John de Hastings,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, passed it away to Sir <HI>Simon de Burley,</HI> who be∣ing attainted of high Treason, in the tenth of his Rule, because, according to his Oath, being Knight of the Garter, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, he endevoured to underprop, like some Butteresse, the sinking Prerogative of his Master, against the onsets of some of the ambitious Nobility, it escheated to the Crown. And then the aforesaid King, in the fourteenth year of his Government, granted it to <HI>John Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington;</HI> and he not long after conveyed it by Sale, to <HI>Reginald Cobham,</HI> whose Widow, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was remarried to <HI>William Clifford</HI> Esquire, and he in her Right, I find, was possest of it in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth. But after his Death, it reverts to <HI>Braybrook,</HI> who had mat∣ched with <HI>Joan</HI> the Heir general of <HI>Cobham,</HI> and he determining likewise in an Heir general, matched to <HI>Brook,</HI> of the West-country, it devolved with <HI>Cobham,</HI> to acknowledge the Signiory of that Family, but continued not long in their Pos∣session: for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Robert Brent,</HI> from whom it descended to his Son <HI>William Brent,</HI> who in the eighth year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, conveyed it to Sir <HI>Henry Wiatt;</HI> and from him
<PB N="166" REF="91"/>did it come down to his Grandchild Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> who being attainted in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> it escheated by Confiscation to the Crown, and then it was granted to <HI>George Brook</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and went along with that Family, untill the beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> and then <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Brook</HI> having embarked himself in the unhappy Design of Sir <HI>Walter Rauleigh,</HI> was atrainted of high Trea∣son, and his Concernment in this Mannor, was forfeited to the Crown, and was, not many years after, by the above-mentioned Prince, granted to Mr. <HI>George Tucker</HI> of <HI>Gravesend;</HI> whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>George Tucker,</HI> hath lately passed away all his In∣terest here to Mr...... <HI>Hamon,</HI> of Queenhith in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Parrocks</HI> is likewise situated within the Circle of <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and had owners of that Sirname, as is evident by an ancient Record, which testifies, that <HI>Robert de Par∣rock,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pat. de An. 52. H. 3. Memb. 10.</NOTE> obtained a Market, weekly on the Saturday, and a Fair yearly to endure for the Space of three Days, <HI>viz.</HI> the Vigil, the Day of St. <HI>Edmund,</HI> and the day after, in the fifty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. Afterwards, this Mannor was linked to the Revenue of the Crown, but whether it was thus annexed by Sale, or by Exchange, I confesse, I am ignorant: only I find by the original Patent, that in the sixth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it was granted to Sir <HI>Simon de Bur∣ley;</HI> upon whose Attaint, in the tenth year of the abovesaid Prince, it devolved to the Crown, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second, not long after, setled it on the Abby of St. <HI>Mary Grace</HI> on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> in whose Revenue it remained untill King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth tore it off by the Publique Dissolution, and united it to the Royall Re∣venue, where it had its fixed aboad, untill the thirteenth year of King <HI>James:</HI> and then it was granted to Mr. <HI>William Salter;</HI> who not many years after, passed it away to Mr. <HI>James Crispe;</HI> from whom in our Memory, partly by Purchase, and partly by Exchange, it went over to Mr. <HI>Jo. Child,</HI> in whose Descendant the Pro∣priety is still permanent.</P>
<P><HI>Gravesend,</HI> had anciently a Market on the Thursday, and a Fair yearly on the Day of St. <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, both granted to this Town, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.</P>
<P><HI>Gillingham,</HI> was a Mannor always relating to the Arch-bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> though the Donation by the Book of <HI>Christ-church</HI> be not specified. If we sur∣vey the Pages of <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book, they will give us this: <HI>Gilling ham est proprium Manerium Archiepiscopi, &amp; in tempore Ewardi Regis se defendebat pro</HI> VI. <HI>Sullings, &amp; est appretiatum hoc quod Archiepiscopus habet inde in Dominio</HI> VIII. <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> <HI>&amp;c</HI> X.s. The Arch-bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> had here an eminent Pallace, and held their Re∣sidence at it, and gave Consecrations here to Bishops, as we find it recorded in the Book called <HI>Textus Roffensis,</HI> or, the Text of <HI>Rochester.</HI></P>
<P><HI>East-court,</HI> and <HI>West-court</HI> in this Parish, were anciently knit together, and resided in a Family called <HI>Gillingham. Richard de Gillingham,</HI> Son of <HI>Thomas de Gillingham,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 176. And left it to his Son <HI>Thomas Gillingham,</HI> who resolved into two Daughters and Coheirs; <HI>Margaret</HI> married to <HI>John Thorpe,</HI> who in her Right, had <HI>West-court;</HI> and <HI>Isabell,</HI> matched to <HI>William Crensted,</HI> who brought along with her <HI>East-court.</HI> But as all things have their Fate and Vicissitude, they did not long acknowledge the Dominion of either of them; for <HI>Thorpe</HI> sold <HI>West-court</HI> to <HI>Ni∣cholas Lawson,</HI> of <HI>Whoorn-place</HI> in <HI>Cuckston,</HI> who not long after, by the same De∣volution, passed it away to <HI>Duling</HI> of <HI>Rochester,</HI> by whose Female Heir, it is now come over to Mr. <HI>Stephen Alcock:</HI> but <HI>Thorp; Ferme,</HI> on which he had planted his own Name, he alienated to <HI>Short,</HI> and from this Family it went away again by Sale to <HI>May</HI> of <HI>Rochester. Greensted</HI> endowed <HI>Benedict Webb,</HI> his Sisters Son, and in that Relation his Heir, with the Title and Propriety of <HI>East-court,</HI> whose two Grand-children <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Christopher Webb,</HI> by a mutuall and joynt Concur∣rence, devested themselves of their Right, and by Sale surrendered it up to <HI>Will. Painter</HI> Esquire, Great Grand-father to Mr. <HI>Allington Painter,</HI> the instant Proprie∣tary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Twidall,</HI> is another Mannor of eminent Account, and had Owners likewise of that Appellation. The first, that I find of the Name, in Mr. <HI>Painter</HI>'s Evidences, which held both this and <HI>Dane-court,</HI> is <HI>Robert de Twidall,</HI> and he slourished here
<PB N="167" REF="91"/>about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the first, and he had Issue <HI>Adam de Twidall,</HI> from whom was lineally extracted, <HI>Richard de Twidall:</HI> who in the fourth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, passed away this, and <HI>Dane-court,</HI> to <HI>John,</HI> the Son of <HI>Robert de Beaufitz,</HI> originally descended from <HI>Reade</HI> in <HI>Marden.</HI> But in this Family, the Possession was not very permanent, for in some Descents after, the Name went out into into <HI>Joan Beaufitz</HI> and other Coheirs: and she by matching with <HI>Robert Arnold</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> did enstate the Possession of both these places, upon this Name and Fami∣ly, and he bequeathed them as Dower, to his Daughter <HI>Elizabeth Arnold:</HI> and shee, in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, conveys them over to her Bro∣ther <HI>Henry;</HI> and his Son <HI>William Arnold,</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, transports his Right in them by Sale to <HI>Thomas Benolt Clarenceux</HI> King of Arms: from whom the like Conveyance, in the twentieth year of that Prince, brought itto Sir <HI>Hen. Wiatt,</HI> one of the Privie Councel, to <HI>Hen.</HI> the 8, whose Son Sir <HI>Tho. Wiat,</HI> in the thirtieth year of that King, exchanged them for other Lands with the Crown: from which immediately after they were conveyed by Grant to <HI>Christopher Sampson,</HI> who not many years after, transplanted his Interest by Sale, into <HI>Thomas Parker:</HI> who conveyed away his Right in <HI>Twidall,</HI> to <HI>William Pain∣ter</HI> Esquire, great Grand-father to Mr. <HI>Allington Painter,</HI> who now enjoys it: but <HI>Dane∣court,</HI> was by Purchase brought over to <HI>Short,</HI> in whom it had not long continued, but the same Fatality carried it away to <HI>May</HI> of <HI>Rochester.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grange</HI> in this Parish, sometimes written <HI>Grench,</HI> did in the Conquerours time, appertain to the old Lords called <HI>Hastings,</HI> Ancestors of the Lord <HI>Hastings</HI> now Earl of <HI>Huntington.</HI> In the Book called <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> kept in the Exchequer we read that one <HI>Manasser de Hastings,</HI> held <HI>Grench</HI> by Serjeanty under King <HI>Hen.</HI> the third, and the particular Office, in some more modern Records is described, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is held of the King (and not of the Cinque-ports as some do suggest) by Serjeanty, to find two men and two Oars in the Ship, which carries over the King from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Whitesand</HI> by <HI>Callis.</HI> From <HI>Hastings,</HI> it came over by Purchase to <HI>Richard Smelt</HI> Alderman of <HI>London:</HI> whose Daughter and Heir <HI>Margaret Smelt</HI> carried it away to <HI>Richard Croyden</HI> likewise an Alderman of <HI>London:</HI> in whom the male-line failing, <HI>Margery</HI> his Sole Heir was matched to <HI>John Philipott</HI> Esquire, Alderman of <HI>London</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, by which Prince he was invested with the Order of Knighthood, for being so signally instrumental in the Ruine of <HI>Wat Tiler, Jack Straw</HI> and his seditious Complices, and had after the Addition of <HI>Gules,</HI> A <HI>plain Crosse</HI> between four <HI>Swords</HI> Argent, <HI>Pomell'd, Or,</HI> as a Coat of Augmentation annexed to his Paternal Coat, <HI>viz. Sable</HI> a <HI>Bend Ermin,</HI> for setting out a Fleet of Ships, at his own expence, and vanquishing <HI>John Mercer,</HI> and his pi∣ratical Rabble, who had so infested the narrow Sea, that the Trade of the Mer∣chant, was brought into a deplorable Condition; and had sunk, had he not buoyd it up again, by his Care and Magnanimity. Yet how laudable soever the work were, it escaped not the Envy of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> who questio∣ned him at the Couucel-Board, for that he being a private Person, had embar∣ked himself in an Attempt of so much Concernment, without Order and Licence first obtained by the State: but by the noble Favour he received from his hono∣rable Friends there, especially <HI>Rychard Fitzallan</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell,</HI> whose Arms he placed in his House, as a Monument of Gratitude, and left him a Legacie in his Will, he was fetched off with Reputation. But to proceed, in Right of the for∣mer Alliance, he was planted in the Possession of this Mannor, and from him it devolved to his Grandchild <HI>John Philipott</HI> Esquire. And he in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, exchanged this Mannor with Sir <HI>Richard Bamme,</HI> Son of <HI>Adam Bamme,</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> for <HI>Twiford</HI> in <HI>Middlesex,</HI> and from him it descen∣ded to <HI>John Bamme</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the third. And he gave it to his Daughter <HI>Katharine Bamme,</HI> who passed it away by Grant to <HI>Kempe</HI> and <HI>Wiatt.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe</HI> sold his moiety to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> who ha∣ving forfeited this to the Crown, by his unhappy Defection in the second year of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> it lodged in the royal Revenue, untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the twenty fourth year of her Rule granted it back again, to the Lady <HI>Joan Wiatt,</HI> and her Son
<PB N="168" REF="92"/><HI>George Wiatt</HI> Esq; who in our Fathers memory, alienated it to <HI>Hayward:</HI> from which Name by the Heir Generall of this Family, it is lately brought to acknow∣ledge Mr. <HI>Will. De Lawn</HI> of <HI>London</HI> for its present Proprietary. There was a Chappel belonging to <HI>Grench,</HI> which upon the Inquisition returned into the Court of Augmentation; but upon the Suppression in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, was affir∣med to have been erected by Sir <HI>John Philipott.</HI> I confesse I have seen no other Record, to evince any thing to the Contrary, and therefore I acquiesce in that Testimony.</P>
<P><HI>Ʋpbery</HI> is the last Mannor in <HI>Gillingham,</HI> which was a Limb of that Demeasn which related to the Nunnery, at <HI>Minster</HI> in <HI>Shepey:</HI> and when the whirlwind of the common Dissolution in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, had shook this into the Revenue of the Crown, that Prince in the thirty eighth year of his Reign, passed it away by Grant, (as appears by the original Patent) to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney;</HI> whose Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> exchanged it with other Lands with Queen <HI>E∣lizabeth,</HI> and shee (as is manifest by the Patent now in the Custody of <HI>Brasen-nose</HI> Colledge) granted it to Sir <HI>Edward Hobby;</HI> who about the latter end of her Reign, conveyed it to the Reverend <HI>Alexander Nowell,</HI> Dean of <HI>Pauls:</HI> and he dying without Issue, in the year 1601, left it for ever to <HI>Brasennose</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> with this Proviso, that one of his Alliance should hold it in Lease from that So∣ciety for ever, paying to the Colledge an 100 Marks <HI>per Annum,</HI> according to the Tenure of which Testamentary Restriction, it is now enjoyed by Col. <HI>Tho. Blount</HI> of <HI>Wriklemersh</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Gillingham</HI> had a Market procured to it, to be held weekly, on the Thursday, and a Fair to be observed yearly at the Feast of St. <HI>Crosse,</HI> and seven days after, by <HI>John</HI> Lord Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears <HI>Cart. Num.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Lidsing,</HI> is the last place of Account in this Parish, it was, in Ages of a higher Ascent, the Inheritance of an ancient Family, called <HI>Sharsted. Simon de Sharsted</HI> possest it at his Death, which was in the twenty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 42. In Ages of a lower Computation, I find <HI>Roger de Say,</HI> to be possest of it; and he about the fiftieth of <HI>E.</HI> the 3d. gives it to <HI>Rob. Belknap</HI> the Judge, who about the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, was by Sentence from Parliament, exiled into <HI>Ireland,</HI> for too vehemently asserting the Prerogative of the Crown, which in the Estimate of those Times, was thought to have opened those sluces too much, which would have let in the Inundations of an arbitrary Power upon the people's Liberties. But this Mannor was again restored by that Prince who looked upon this person as his Martyr, to him as its ancient Possessor, in the twenty second year of his Reign, and he by his Deed, bearing Date the eighth of <HI>October,</HI> in the second year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, gives it to the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Rochester,</HI> for one Monk who was a Priest, to celebrate Masse for ever for the Soul of his Father <HI>John Belknap,</HI> and for the Soul of his Mother <HI>Alice,</HI> Wife of the said <HI>John,</HI> and likewise for the Soul of himself, and all his Successors, in the Cathedrall of <HI>Rochester.</HI> This, upon the Dissolution of the for∣mer Priory, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, upon his Institution of the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Rochester,</HI> granted to them for their support and Alimony, and rested in their Reve∣nue untill these Times.</P>
<P>There was another Chauntry founded at <HI>Twidall,</HI> by <HI>John Beaufits,</HI> which he makes provision for, by his last Will, the twenty second of <HI>November,</HI> in the year of our Lord, 1433, and orders it to be dedicated to <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and likewise that one Priest should there celebrate Masse for the Soul of Himself, his Wife <HI>A∣lice,</HI> his Father <HI>John,</HI> his Mother <HI>Isabell,</HI> and his Uncle <HI>William Beaufitz:</HI> the Seats in the Chappel, and other Remains, declare it to have been formerly a neat and elegant Piece of Architecture.</P>
<P>Here was a signall Encounter (as the Annals of St. <HI>Austins</HI> testifie) between <HI>Edmund Ironside,</HI> and <HI>Canutus</HI> the Dane, wherein, after a Sharp Debate, the Dane was broken and discomfited.</P>
<P>At <HI>Gillingham</HI> likewise (as <HI>Thomas Robburn</HI> a Monk of <HI>Winchester</HI> testifies) was acted that bloody Tragedy by Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> who slew all those Normans who ar∣rived
<PB N="169" REF="92"/>with <HI>Edward</HI> unto the tenth man, for which his Name as well as his Con∣science, stands bespatter'd and stain'd with an indelible Character of Ignominy, and Cruelty to all Posterity.</P>
<P><HI>Goodwenston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was the ancient Seat of <HI>Chich.</HI> The first of Eminence, was <HI>Ernaldus Chich,</HI> who was a man of principall Account in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Richard</HI> the first, and King <HI>John:</HI> nor were they more eminent here, then they were at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where they had large Posses∣sions, and unto them did the Aldermanry of <HI>Burgate</HI> appertain. <HI>Thomas Chich</HI> of <HI>Goodwenston,</HI> was a prime Benefactor, to the Church of St. <HI>Mary Bredmin</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where his Name together with his Effigies are in an old Character set up, in the West-window, as his Coat is likewise in the Chancel, insculped in Stone-work. He was Bailiff of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> an Office not contemptible in those Times, in the year 1259, and again in the year 1271. <HI>Thomas Chich,</HI> this mans Son, was She∣riff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the forty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Goodwenston. Thomas Chich,</HI> this Mans Son, was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> likewise in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and he was Grandfather to <HI>Valentine Chich,</HI> who matched with <HI>Philippa</HI> Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>Robert Chichley,</HI> Brother to <HI>Henry Chichley,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but dyed without Issue-male: so that his three Sisters and Coheirs wedded to <HI>Kemp, Judde,</HI> and <HI>Martin,</HI> shared his In∣heritance, and by a joint Consent, about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passed away their Estate here and at <HI>Ewell,</HI> in this parish, to <HI>Pordage</HI> of <HI>Rodmer∣sham:</HI> and from this Name about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it passed a∣way to <HI>Fagg</HI> descended from the <HI>Faggs</HI> of <HI>Willesborough,</HI> where I find by the Court Rolls of the Mannor of <HI>Brabourne,</HI> that one <HI>Andrew Fagge</HI> held Lands there of that Mannor, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. But to go on, the <HI>Faggs</HI> had not long been planted in their new atchieved Purchase at this place, when <HI>Robert Fagge</HI> concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Ann</HI> who was mat∣ched to Sir <HI>John Proude,</HI> who was unhappily slain at the <HI>Groll,</HI> in the year 1628, whilst he did vigorously pursue the Quarrel of the States General, at that Siege against the Capital Enemy of their Religion, and Liberty, the Spaniard: and <HI>Mary</HI> espoused to Sir <HI>Edward Partrich,</HI> for his first Wife, but dyed without any Issue surviving by him. Sir <HI>John Proud</HI> left only one Daughter called <HI>Ann,</HI> who was first wedded to Sir <HI>William Springate,</HI> and secondly to Mr. <HI>Isaac Pennington,</HI> eldest Son to <HI>Isaac Pennington,</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London</HI> in the year 1643, in Right of which Alliance, he at present holds this Mannor of <HI>Goodwenston.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Goodneston</HI> by <HI>Wingham</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Gonston,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Wingham</HI> and was formerly parcell of the Patrimony of <HI>Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> bequea∣thed to him by his Kinsman <HI>John de Hastings;</HI> who was first Husband to <HI>Juliana,</HI> the Heir generall of <HI>Roger de Leybourn. John de Hostings</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and so did his Son <HI>John de Hastings</HI> after him, and brings a pleading for it in the fourteenth year of <HI>R.</HI> the second. After them the <HI>Malmains</HI> were possest of it, who had some Estate here before, which they had by Purchase from <HI>Pine</HI> and <HI>Beauchamp,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and in this Family did it remain, untill <HI>Henry Malmains,</HI> about the year ........ deceased without Issue-male, and then by <HI>Agnes</HI> his Daughter and Heir marryed to <HI>Thomas Goldwell,</HI> it came to own the Jurisdiction of that Name and Family, but was not long fastned to it: for he en∣ded likewise in a Female Heir called <HI>Joan,</HI> who was wedded to <HI>Thomas Took</HI> of <HI>Bere</HI> Esquire, and so by her it was united to the Revenue of this Family, and here rested; untill that Age which came within the Circle of our Grandsathers Knowledge, and then it was passed away to <HI>Henekar,</HI> from which Name in Times almost of our Cognisance, it went away by a Revolution like the former to <HI>Kelley,</HI> who conveyed it to <HI>Engham,</HI> descended from the noble Family of the <HI>Enghams,</HI> of <HI>Wood∣church,</HI> who flourished so many Ages at <HI>Edingam,</HI> and <HI>Pleurinden</HI> in that Parish.</P>
<P><HI>Bonnington</HI> in this Parish, is the ancient Seat, from whence the numerous and Knightly Family of <HI>Bois,</HI> did as from their originall Fountain issue out,
<PB N="170" REF="93"/>into <HI>Fredville, Betteshhanger, Haukherst,</HI> and other parts of this Countie; and do derive themselves from <HI>John de Bosco,</HI> who is mentioned in the Battle-Abby Roll, of those who entered this Nation with <HI>Will.</HI> the Conquerour: and certainly they have not been much lesse at this place then 17 Descents, as the datelesse Deeds of se∣veral of this Family who writ themselves of <HI>Bonnington,</HI> do easily manifest. Nor hath it yet deserted the Name, or departed from the Possession of <HI>Bois,</HI> being at this present, part of the patrimony of Sir <HI>John Bois,</HI> to whose paternal Arms, the late King for his eminent and loyall Service perform'd by him at <HI>Donnington</HI> Castle, added as an Augmentation, upon a <HI>Canton, Azure,</HI> a Crown imperial, <HI>Or.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rolling,</HI> is a third place in this Parish to be taken notice of: It contributed a Seat as well as a Sirname, formerly, to a Family called <HI>Rolling. Thomas Rolling</HI> held some Lands in Lease at his Death, which was in the fisteenth year of <HI>Ric.</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 143. which Lands belonged to a Chauntry in St. <HI>Peters Church</HI> in <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and lay in <HI>Eastry,</HI> near his Mannor of <HI>Rolling.</HI> After this Family was worn out, the <HI>Idley's</HI> who had large Possessions about <HI>Mepham, Cobham,</HI> and <HI>Higham,</HI> as appears by the Inquisition taken after the Death of <HI>John Idelegh,</HI> in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<P><HI>Godmersham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Felborough,</HI> was given to the Monks of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by <HI>Beornulfus</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> eight hundred twenty and one, free as <HI>Adisham;</HI> and it was, at the Request of Arch-bishop <HI>Ʋlfred,</HI> to supply the Covent both with Food and Raiment, which Grant Arch-bishop <HI>Egelnoth,</HI> who it seems had some Interest in the Place, in the year one Thousand thirty and six, did fully confirm. And in the year one thou∣sand three hundred fourscore and seven, <HI>Thomas Arundell</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> with the especiall Licence of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, appropriated the Tiths of the Rectory of <HI>Godmersham,</HI> to the Church of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> to the Support and Maintenance of the Fabrick of the Church abovesaid.</P>
<P>If you will see what Value was set upon this Mannor in the Time of the Conquerour, I shall afford you a Sight of it, out of <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book. <HI>Godmersham</HI> (says that Register) <HI>est Manerium Monachorum, &amp; de Vestitu eorum, &amp; in Tempore Edwardi Regis, se defendebat pro</HI> VIII. <HI>Sullings, &amp; est appretiatum</HI> XX. <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> <HI>sed tamen reddit</HI> XXX. That is, it paid a Rent of thirty pound to the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Yolands</HI> and <HI>Ford,</HI> are two other little Mannors in this Parish, which acknow∣ledged themselves anciently to be parcell of the Inheritance of <HI>Valoigns.</HI> And <HI>Robert de Valoigns,</HI> dyed possest of these and much other Land in this Track, in the nineteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 41. <HI>Henry de Va∣loigns,</HI> this mans Son, was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the fourteenth of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and he had Issue <HI>Waretius de Valoigns,</HI> and <HI>Stephen de Valoigns</HI> who planted himself at <HI>Gore-Court</HI> in <HI>Otham,</HI> and is represented in Record, to be one of the Conservators of the Peace for this County, in the twenty ninth, and thirty first years of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: but <HI>Waretius de Valoigns</HI> determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, one was matched to <HI>Fogge,</HI> and the other to <HI>Thomas Aldon,</HI> Son of <HI>Thomas de Aldon,</HI> who was one of the Conservators of the Peace in <HI>Kent</HI> in the tenth and twelfth years of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and he in her Right was entituled to the Possession of these places. And in this Family did it for diverse years continue, untill the ordinary Mutation of Purchase rowled them into the In∣heritance of <HI>Austin;</HI> to which Name, the Title remained constantly linked, un∣till that Age we style our Grand-fathers, and then they were by <HI>Richard Austin,</HI> passed away by Sale to <HI>Broadnix,</HI> so that they are now by paternal Right, devol∣ved to <HI>Thomas Broadnix</HI> Esquire, in whose Estate the instant Propriety of them does lye involved.</P>

<P><HI>Egerton</HI> in <HI>Godmersham</HI> was a Mannor which formerly swelled the demeasn of the no∣ble Family of <HI>Valence,</HI> who were Earls of <HI>Pembroke. Aymer de Valence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, as appears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 75. And leaving no lawfull Issue, this, upon the par∣tition of his Estate, increased the Revenue of <HI>John Comin</HI> Earl of <HI>Badzenoth</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had married <HI>Joan</HI> one of his two Sisters and Coheirs: But long it remained not here, for he deceased without any Issue-male, so that <HI>Joan</HI> his sole Daughter, matched to <HI>David de Strabolgie</HI> Earl of <HI>Atholl,</HI> became his Heir, and he in her Right, was found to be invested in the Possession, in the first year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, as is manifest <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 85. And from him did it devolve by Descent, to his Son and Heir, <HI>David de Strabolgie,</HI> who in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, by Deed, setled it on his Kinsman Sir <HI>Henry de Hills,</HI> which, <HI>Katharine</HI> his Widow and Countesse confirms, the twentieth year of that Prince: <HI>Gilbert de Hills,</HI> lieth buryed in <HI>Godmersham Church,</HI> and as appears by his Pourtraict∣ure in his Armour, was a person of Eminence in that Age, wherein he flou∣rished, and from him, and Sir <HI>Henry de Hills,</HI> did issue forth many eminent and worthy Successors, who were Proprietaries of this Mannor, untill that Age which fell within the Precincts of our Crandfathers Memory, and then it went away by Sale to <HI>Scot,</HI> a Cadet or younger Sprig of the <HI>Scotts</HI> of <HI>Scotts-Hall:</HI> the Heir Ge∣neral of which Family, was Mrs. <HI>Dorothy Scott,</HI> who being lately matched to Mr. <HI>Daniell Gotherson,</HI> he in her Right is now (though not without a signal Conten∣tion at Law, with some collateral Pretenders to the Title) peaceably planted in the Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Godmersham</HI> as the Records of <HI>Christ-church</HI> inform mee, had the Grant of a Market, to be observed weekly on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly upon the Thurs∣day and Friday, in <HI>Whitson</HI> Week by the Prior of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.</P>
<P><HI>Goudherst</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Marden,</HI> with the inherent Mannor of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> were the ancient Patrimony of a Family of no cheap Account in this Track, which, as it chose one of these Mannors for its Seat, so did it derive its Sirname from thence likewise, and was called <HI>Bedgbury,</HI> and certainly were of a very high Ascent in their Extraction. For in a Deed without Date, one <HI>John de Bedge∣bury</HI> demises some parcels of Land to <HI>William de Comden</HI> of <HI>Comden House</HI> in this Parish, and the Seal affixed to this Deed is a Cavalier on Horseback, armed, like one of the Knights Templers, which argues that he lived before the Suppression of that Order, and assumed that Impresse out of his particular Affection to them; or else, which was customary in those Times, out of some signall and solemn vow, to maintain the Temple of our Saviour, from the Assaults and barbarous Impressions of Infidels, which these persons were by their Oath, and first Insti∣tution, oblieged vigorously to defend also. <HI>John de Bedgebury,</HI> this man's Suc∣cessor, paid respective Aid for his Lands at <HI>Goudherst,</HI> and likewise for his Man∣nor of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left these above recited Mannors to his Son <HI>John de Bedge∣bury</HI> who dying without Issue, his Sister became his Sole Inheritrix, who by matching with <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bayhall</HI> in <HI>Pepenbury,</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, fastned the Propriety of these places, to the Interest of this Family, where they continued undivided, but in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, Court <HI>Shingley</HI> was by <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> a∣lienated to <HI>Stephen Darell:</HI> but <HI>Goudherst</HI> and <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> were not plucked away from this Family, by this Alienation, but continued united to their Estate, so that at this Day they own <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> Esquire, for their Proprietary.</P>
<P><HI>Combwell</HI> was a Priory of Black Canons, under the Rule of St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> and was founded by Sir <HI>Robert de Thurnham,</HI> and dedicated to the Honor of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen.</HI> Their Revenue lay scattered in <HI>Marden, Stapleherst,</HI> and <HI>Goudherst;</HI> in which last, there was an obscure Cell, or Convent of Nuns, which had their prin∣cipal Subsistence by their Charity, whose Ruines are yet visible, though their Re∣venue, was so narrow, that no Record informs us where it was situated. Upon
<PB N="172" REF="94"/>the Dissolution in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this devolving to the Crown, that Prince in the thirty fourth year of his Government, granted it to Sir <HI>John Gage,</HI> one of the Justices of the Peace, both for <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Kent;</HI> and his Suc∣cessor conveyed it to <HI>Colepeper,</HI> who immediately after, passed it away to <HI>William Campion</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to Sir <HI>William Campion,</HI> who was offe∣red up a Sacrifice, to the Cause and Quarrel of the last King at <HI>Colchester,</HI> in the year one thousand fix hundred forty eight, and in his Heirs is the Interest of this Mannor at this instant resident.</P>
<P><HI>Finchcocks</HI> is a third place of note in this Parish, made more eminent in that it was the Mansion of a Family of that Sirname, whom, although I find invested in the Possession of this place, ever since the fortieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, yet do I not discover that any of the Family was illustrious by any important under∣taking, or famous by any eminent Office. The next Family which stept into the Possession was <HI>Horden</HI> of <HI>Horden;</HI> and he became Proprietary of it by Purchase about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, one of which Family was <HI>Edward Hor∣den</HI> Esquire, who was Knight of the Greencloth to <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> who dyed without Issue-male, and left his Estate to be shared between two Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> matched to Mr. <HI>Paul Bat∣hurst,</HI> descended from <HI>Bathurst</HI> Street in <HI>Nordiam,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> espoused to Mr. <HI>Delves</HI> of <HI>Fletchings,</HI> who in her Right carried away <HI>Horden,</HI> where certainly, the above-recited Family had flourished under a noble Estimate; for <HI>Edward Horden</HI> the last of this Name was issued out from <HI>William Chichley,</HI> second Brother to <HI>Henry Chichley</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and for some considerable Service performed to the Crown, had the Augmentation of a Regal <HI>Diadem,</HI> upon a <HI>Canton</HI> added to his paternal Coat, by Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> But to proceed, <HI>Finchcocks</HI> by the above-mentioned match, devolved to be the Possession of <HI>Bathurst,</HI> and so owns it self at this Day, to be the Estate of this Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Patenden</HI> is another place which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of no vul∣gar Repute in this County, and was seated in its Possession, as appears by ori∣ginal Deeds and other old Records, as high as the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and where, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, there was issued out a Commission to <HI>Gervas Clifton</HI> Esquire, then Sheriff of the County, to return all those, who did <HI>portare Arma antiqua.</HI> Amongst the Register and Catalogue of those who were then returned, <HI>Patenden</HI> is recorded, who was Lord of this place, and from him did the Propriety of this place by Descent glide down to his Suc∣cessor, who, in those Times we style our Fathers, passed it away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Bathurst.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Twisden,</HI> is a fifth place, which invites us to a Survey. It was in elder Generations the Inheritance of <HI>Twisdens,</HI> upon whom, I may without any Supply of Flattery, strew those just Attributes of Ancient and Noble. The first, that I find by Deed to be of this Family, Possessor of it, was <HI>Adam de Twisden,</HI> and he was seised of it,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This</HI> Rog. Twisden <HI>was Stew∣ard to the Abby of St.</HI> Augustins <HI>a place of great Trust in those Times.</HI></NOTE> in the one and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. In times of a lower Descent, <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> was possest of it, and in the fifth year of <HI>H.</HI> the fourth, affixes to a Deed now in the Hands of Sir <HI>Roger Twisden,</HI> of <HI>Roydon</HI> Hall, Baronet, the Signature or Impression of a Cockatrice on Wax. The Crest, which, at this Day, is annexed to the paternal Coat of this Family, a rare thing in those Times when Crests were infrequent and unusuall, and began to be customary, when those eminent Familyes who were embarked in the two Factions, of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> assumed them to serve as Evidences or Symbols of Distin∣ction, whereby the Son might avoid the plunging his Sword in the Bowells of his Father, or a Brother the Sheathing his in the Entrails of his Brother. But to proceed, the last of this Name, who possest this place, was <HI>Roger Twisden,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>H.</HI> the sixth, passed it away to <HI>Roger Twisden,</HI> and he imme∣diately after conveyed it by Sale to <HI>Geffrey Allen,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>H.</HI> the sixth, setled the Right of it by Deed in <HI>Thomas Windhill.</HI> And thus far do the Copies of diverse original Evidences, which relate to this Place, extend and no farther. After this, it was for diverse Descents wrapt up in the Propriety of <HI>Austin,</HI> who not many years since expiring in a Female Inheritrix, she, by mat∣ching
<PB N="173" REF="94"/>with Mr. <HI>Fowle</HI> a Cadet of the <HI>Fowles</HI> of <HI>River-Hall</HI> in <HI>Sussen,</HI> hath made it the present Possession of that Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Shingley</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Goudherst,</HI> which belonged to that Revenue which did own the Signory of the Priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> and upon the suppression, when the Pa∣trimony of this Cloister was broken to peeces by the Scepter of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, this was in the thirty sixth year of that Prince granted to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury</HI> Esquire, with all the Priviledges which it was fortified with, when it related to the abovementioned Cloister, as namely to be Tith-free, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Title (such a Moath and Canker cleaves to the Patrimony of the Church when it is transplanted) made no long stay in <HI>Colepeper,</HI> for in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, this <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> alienated it to <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Darrell;</HI> but in this Family like∣wise was the Possession of as frail a permanence: for they nor long after conveyed it to <HI>William Campion</HI> Esquire, Counsellor at Law, from whom it descended to Sir <HI>William Campion</HI> Governor of <HI>Borestall</HI> House near <HI>Oxford,</HI> for His Late Majesty, and who was after slain at <HI>Colchester,</HI> asserting the Royal Interest, and in his Descendants is the Propriety of it still wrapped up.</P>
<P><HI>Bokinfold</HI> is the last place of Consideration in <HI>Goudherst;</HI> it was a Mannor which related to that Chauntry, which was founded here by <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> and con∣firmed with all the Franchises annexed to it by <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, in the one and for∣tieth year of his Raign, and in this Patent of Inspection and Ratification, it is men∣tioned that <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> was its Founder: But the common Dissolution in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, renting away (like some suddain and impetuous Tor∣rent) this Mannor from those Ends and Uses it was first designed to, lodged it in the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince in the one and thirtieth year of his Raign, granted it to <HI>Paul Sidnore</HI> Gentleman, and he not long after conveyed it to Sir <HI>John Gates;</HI> but he being one of the principal Emissaries or Complices of <HI>John Seymour</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> being inwrapped and ingaged past Recovery in the Design of the above said Duke, sunk in the Ruines of that unfortunate Peere, and was convicted of High Treason, and beheaded on Tower-Hill, in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth. Upon his Tragedy, this Mannor returned to the Crown, and stayed there, until the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was granted to <HI>Katherine Tong,</HI> who not long after passed it away to <HI>Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> who, almost in our remembrance, passed away that part of this Great Mannor, which is circumscribed within the Verge of <HI>Goudherst</HI> to the instant Proprietary <HI>Brewer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Joan</HI> Widow of <HI>Roger de Bedgebury,</HI> in the third year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, obtain∣ed a weekly Market to <HI>Goudhurst</HI> on the Wednesday, and a Fair yearly on the Day of our Ladies Assumption, <HI>Cart. de Anno tertio Richardi secundi, Numb.</HI> 13.</P>

<P><HI>HAckington,</HI> otherwise called St. <HI>Stephens,</HI> lies partly in the Hundred of <HI>Bredge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> and partly in that of <HI>Westgate,</HI> and did in elder Times appertain to the Monks of Christ-Church in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> until it was exchanged by the Prior, and that Covent and the Monks of it, with <HI>Stephen Langton,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for other Houses situated near the Priory of St. <HI>Gregories</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and he having here at <HI>Hackington</HI> erected a new Fabrick, bestowed and setled it on his Brother <HI>Simon de Lang∣ton,</HI> Arch-deacon of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> from whom it successively came down to the following Arch-deacons, and became their fixed Mansion until the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, of those who were invested with that Office: But in the general suppression, the im∣pious hand of sacriledge having plucked it off from the Church; it was annexed to the Crown, and continued there until Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it to Sir <HI>Roger Man∣wood,</HI> chief Baron of the Exchequer, and from him did it devolve to his Grand-child, Sir <HI>John Manwood,</HI> who passed it away in our Memory to Colonel Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper,</HI> Colonel of a Regiment of Foot in the Low Countries, in whose Descendants the Pos∣session is now resident.</P>

<P>In Times of a very high Ascent, Arch-bishop <HI>Hubert,</HI> and after him Arch-bishop <HI>Baldwin</HI> had a Design to have erected a Colledge first here at <HI>Hackington,</HI> and then up∣on second Thoughts at <HI>Lambeth;</HI> but the Monks of Christ-church, believing that this intended new Seminary of Religion, might something by its Interposition darken the Glory and Grandeur of their Covent, first by <HI>Alanus</HI> their then Prior, and afterwards by Proxie, so vigorously opposed this Project at <HI>Rome,</HI> that by the Favor and Indulgence of the then Popes, it was vacated and extinguished: But in times subsequent to these, these Monks having much endeared <HI>Stephen Langton,</HI> the then Arch-bishop, by bestowing some Signal Favors on <HI>Simon de Langton</HI> his Brother, the Controversie, which was fomented by the above mentioned Design, by his compliance with the Monks was appeased, and entombed in an amicable Pacification.</P>

<P><HI>Hadlow</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hadlow Borough</HI> &amp; <HI>Littlefeild,</HI> gave both Seat &amp; Sirname to a Family ancient and conspicuous enough in this Track: but whether the same with that Family which was seated at <HI>Hadlow-place</HI> in <HI>Crundall,</HI> is altogether ambiguous; certain I am that <HI>Edmund de Hadlow</HI> died seised of it in the thirty second of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and from this Name in the subsequent Age it came to the Crown, but whether by Escheat, Exchange, or Purchase; no Beam, scattered from any private or publique Record, can so far enlighten my Knowledge as to discover. <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the twenty fifth of his Raign, granted this and many other Possessions, lying about the Skirts of the <HI>Lowey</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> to <HI>Humphrey Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and with this Name it went along till <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> being infortunately offered up a Sacrifice to the Malice and Ambition of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and the Losse of his Head having been the expiation of some Vanities, which he had been too much Guilty of, the Right by his Attaint flowing back into the Crown, it was invested in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth by Royal Concession in <HI>John Vane</HI> Esquire, whose Successor Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> not many years since sold it to <HI>Thomas Petley,</HI> whose descendant now enjoyes it.</P>
<P><HI>Peckham</HI> in this Parish was part of the Patrimony of the Noble Family of <HI>Peckham,</HI> and one <HI>John Peckham</HI> (as the Book called the Survey of the Mannors of <HI>Hadlow,</HI> taken in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth informs me) anciently possest it, from which Name it was by Sale rent away, and incorporated into the Interest of <HI>Colepeper;</HI> for <HI>John Colepeper</HI> (as the above mentioned Survey instructs me) sold it to <HI>Leigh,</HI> and after the Possession had been for some intermission of Time riveted into this Family, it was by the same Alienation taken away, and by <HI>John Leigh</HI> trans∣mittted to Sir <HI>George Rivers,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>John Rivers,</HI> did lately upon his De∣cease as his Heir successively claim it.</P>
<PB N="175" REF="95"/>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Fromonds</HI> is mentioned likewise in the abovesaid Survey: It gave Sirname to <HI>Fromonds,</HI> Ancestor to <HI>Fromond</HI> of <HI>Cheame</HI> in <HI>Surrey;</HI> but whether it yeelded Seat likewise, is the Question. Certain it is, it staid not long in this Name: for <HI>Richard Fromond</HI> sold it to <HI>Colepeper:</HI> nor was it long fixed or constant in this Family neither; for <HI>Richard Colepeper</HI> after the ebbing away of some successive Generations cast the Possession by sale into <HI>John Fromond</HI> again, originally extracted from the above men∣tioned <HI>Richard Fromond:</HI> and to this Name this Seat and its Interest continues (for ought I can yet discover) at this instant fastned and united.</P>
<P><HI>Causton</HI> is the next (because it owned a Family of that Sirname) that claims our Consideration. It was in Ages of higher Ascent, the Demesne and Interest of some of this Name; but whether the <HI>Caustons</HI> of the County of <HI>Salop</HI> were issued from hence, or these of this Seat extracted originally from thence, is yet under dispute; and the more, because Eviderce of Deeds, which is the Lant horn, not only of An∣tiquity, but sometimes of Reason likewise, is wholly wanting. It is without Con∣troversie, this Mansion was not long in the <HI>Caustons,</HI> for the thread of Succession was interrupted and broken, and <HI>Hugh Causton</HI> by Sale conveyed it over to the <HI>Wattons</HI> of <HI>Addington:</HI> nor was it long resident here, for <HI>William Watton</HI> sold it to <HI>Thomas Peckham</HI> branched out from the <HI>Peckham,</HI> of <HI>Yaldham</HI> in <HI>Wrotham,</HI> from whom by a like Muta∣tion that changed the Scene and Face of the Title; it was alienated to <HI>Vane,</HI> and after some stay in that Name, lately by Purchase made the Propriety of <HI>Maynard</HI> of <HI>May∣feild</HI> in the County of <HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Totlingbery</HI> had the Repute of a Mannor also, and was the Mansion sometime of that Name, till Time the great Channel of all Things, that either sinks or preserves them, carried it down from <HI>John Totlingbery,</HI> to the Family of <HI>Roberts</HI> of <HI>Glastenbury</HI> in <HI>Cranbrook,</HI> and the same stream of vicissitude wafted it not long after from <HI>Walter Roberts</HI> the Last of that Name, which enjoyed it, to <HI>John Vane</HI> Esquire; where (no Record or Evidence suggesting yet any thing to the contrary) I think it yet con∣tinues.</P>
<P><HI>Goldhell</HI> may be looked upon as a place of some importance, since some Families of Estimate have been Possessors of it, for first it was the Possession of the <HI>Bealds;</HI> so they are styled in the Survey. And when this Family began to moulder away, the Title by Sale shifted it self to the <HI>Fromonds,</HI> a Name eminent enough in this Track: and when they began to languish away into the common Familty of Families: <HI>John Fromond</HI> sold it to the <HI>Colepepers</HI> of <HI>Oxenhoath.</HI> And this Branch of the <HI>Colepepers</HI> con∣cluding at last in three Daughters and Coheirs; one of them being wedded to <HI>Cotton</HI> of <HI>Lanwade</HI> in the County of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> made this Part of the Revenue of that Fa∣mily; but they desiring to contract their Interest into a nearer Circumference, cast this by sale into the Possession of Sir <HI>George Chowne,</HI> to whose Successor it very lately entitled it self.</P>
<P><HI>Goding</HI> and <HI>Crombery</HI> are Mannors of some Signal Respect, since they acknow∣ledged themselves to be part of the Patrimony of <HI>Fromond,</HI> a Family by an eminent Succession of Gentry noble and conspicuous, which being by Time broken and dis∣ordered; it not long after was by <HI>Thoma Fromond</HI> sold to <HI>John Goding.</HI> From whom after the series of that Name was by the same alteration interrupted; it was con∣veyed to the <HI>Peckhams,</HI> where it hao not long made its Residence, but the Title by purchase (like an Orbe never much in repose) rowled it self from <HI>Thomas Peckham</HI> into <HI>Vane,</HI> where for some years it has rested.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Moateland<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> shall be the last mentioned, (though not in the above specified Survey, yet) in mine, in Relation to this Parish. The first Family that I track in the Record to be Possessors of it, were the <HI>Bakers</HI> of <HI>East-Peckham,</HI> in which Name the Propriety of it lay wrapt up, till <HI>Richard Baker</HI> did devest himself of his Right, and passed it over by Sale to <HI>Burgesse:</HI> where it had not long dwelt, but the same Change untwined it. For <HI>Thomas Burgesse</HI> alienated it to <HI>Henry Leigh,</HI> and in his Successor (till a clearer Ray of more Modern Intelligence, directs me to believe the Contrary) I think the Possession is resident.</P>
<P>There are two other Seats of Venerable Account in this Parish. The Mannor of the Rectory is the first, which in the year 1287. was by <HI>Thomas de Inglethorp</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI> (as the Records of that Church signifie) appropriated to the Knights of
<PB N="176" REF="96"/>St. <HI>John,</HI> otherwise called the Knights Hospitalers, and remained locked up in their Demeasne, until the publique Suppression snatched it away, and united it to the Crown, where it lodged until the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then it was granted to Sir <HI>Ralph Vane,</HI> whose Descendant about the middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> passed it away to <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esquire, Captain of a Troop of <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen at the Camp formed at <HI>Tilbury,</HI> to oppose the Hostile Eruptions of the <HI>Spanish</HI> in the year 1588. And from him it is now come by Descent to be possest by his Grand∣child, that learned and accomplished Gentleman Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> of <HI>Roydon Hall,</HI> Knight and Baroner.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Fish-Hall,</HI> the Mansion formerly of <HI>John de Fisher,</HI> so called, be∣cause he was invested with a Priviledge by <HI>Gilbert de Clare,</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> and Lord of the <HI>Lowey</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> to have the Fishing freely and uncontrouledly within his Jurisdiction, or as far as it did extend, so that from this Immunity or Franchise, his Posterity contracted the Sirname of <HI>Fisher,</HI> and for some Ages, did the Right of it remain interwoven with the Demeasne of this Family, till <HI>Richard Fisher</HI> sold it to <HI>John Vane</HI> Esquire, from whom the same Revolution not long after transported it to <HI>Rivers</HI> of <HI>Chafford,</HI> and now the Title is ingrafted into a yonger Branch of that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Halling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> has nothing remarkable in it but the Man∣nor of <HI>Langridge, aliâs Bavent;</HI> for so it is written frequently in Records, and indeed not without some Reason to support the Orthography; for in Times of elder Prescription, it gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family that had that Ap∣pellation, and there is some Track or Print yet of the Ruines of a Mansion∣house in that Feild, which is at this Day called <HI>Bavents;</HI> and <HI>Roger de Bavent</HI> died in possession of it in the thirty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: and when this Name was worn out, the next which we find in Succession to be Proprietary of it, was <HI>Langridge,</HI> a Branch spouted out from that Stem of <HI>Langridge,</HI> which was anciently planted in the County of <HI>South-hampton.</HI> And when this Family was decayed and vanished, and had left nothing to evidence to us that it had once a Be∣ing here: but the adopting this Mannor into its Name, the Possession went into <HI>Melford,</HI> and here, after it had had some short abode, it abandoned this Family, and cast the Interest of it into the Patrimony of <HI>Raynwell,</HI> whose Successor after some short Flux of Time (as appears by the Book of Aid kept in the Exchequer) sold it to <HI>Robert Wotton,</HI> in the seventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and he suddainly after alienated this and other Lands to <HI>Whorne</HI> of <HI>Cuckston;</HI> nor was the Title any length of Time lodged in this Name; for a Fate of the same condition with the former carried it over to <HI>Vane,</HI> from whom it flowed away in the same Current, and by Sale emptied it self into <HI>Barnewell,</HI> nor was it lesse permanent there, for the same inconstant Tide wafted it down to <HI>Nicholas Lewson,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Lewson</HI> his Grand-child, desirous to wrap up all his Interest within the County of <HI>Stafford,</HI> alie∣nated his <HI>Kentish</HI> Lands to several persons, and sold those which were part of his Demesne here to <HI>Barber.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Halling</HI> it self was given to the Church of <HI>Rochester,</HI> by <HI>Egbert</HI> King of the West <HI>Saxons,</HI> in the year of our Lord 838. and has continued parcel of the Churches Patrimony in an uninterrupted Succession of Time, till the year 1643. and then the Title was raveled and discomposed.</P>
<P><HI>Halden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackborne</HI> and <HI>Barekley</HI> has nothing worthy in it that may oblige a Remembrance, but only <HI>Hales-place,</HI> from whence, as from their Fountain, the several Streams of the <HI>Hales,</HI> that in divided Rivulets have spread themselves over the whole County, did originally break forth. But where this <HI>Hales-place</HI> is now placed, or in what Angle of the Parish it is situated: I confesse I cannot instruct my self, unlesse it be that Great House which was the Original Seat of the <HI>Scots,</HI> before they planted at <HI>Congerherst</HI> in <HI>Haukherst,</HI> and which <HI>Reginald Scot</HI> sold to Sir <HI>Edward Hales.</HI> Indeed it is often mentioned in the Pedigree of <HI>Hales,</HI> and likewise in the Deeds of that Family, as lying in <HI>Halden,</HI> which is evidence enough that there was such a Mansion in this Parish; though peradventure through
<PB N="177" REF="96"/>Neglect and Disuse, and by altering its Possessor, it have at present lost its Name.</P>
<P><HI>Halstow</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> was anciently part of the Barony of <HI>Bardolph,</HI> but did not long rest here, for <HI>Isolda</HI> the Daughter and Co-heir of <HI>Hugh de Bardolph,</HI> being married to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> this was thrown into that Scale (with other De∣mesnes of vast Estimate) which did after swell the Revenue of this Baron into a huge Dimension. But, as all sublunary matters have the Fate of an uncertain incon∣stancy written in indelible Characters upon them, so had this; for <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> this mans Successor, sold it to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and he died possest of it in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, from whose Heir an equivalent Vicissitude resigned it up to the illustrious Family of <HI>Zouch;</HI> and <HI>William La Zouch,</HI> extracted from the <HI>Zouches</HI> of <HI>Haringworth</HI> in the County of <HI>North-hampton,</HI> died actually possest of it in the fifth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; and after the Title had been some years knit to the Relation and Interest of this Family, it was at length torn off by the rough Hand of Time, and by Sale surrendered up to <HI>Norris,</HI> from whose Heir by as quick a Transition it conveyed it self over to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Grand-father to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Baronet, now surviving.</P>
<P><HI>Halsted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Codsheath</HI> was the Inheritance of a good old Family called <HI>Malavill,</HI> who were of no contemptible Account in this part of the County; for in the Pipe-Rols, relating to the Raign of King <HI>John,</HI> I discover, that <HI>Robert de Malavill</HI> was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae,</HI> in the fourth year of that Prince, and then again in the seventh year of his Rule, he was dignified with that eminent Place of Trust, and he had Issue <HI>William de Malavil,</HI> who was in the enjoyment of this Mannor at his Death, which was in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears by an escheat Roll, marked with the number 56. And in this Family did the Right and Title of it lie involved, untill the latter End of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and then the noted Family of <HI>Bures</HI> stept by Purchase into the Possession, and <HI>John Bures,</HI> (as appears to me by an old Deed) held it in the fourth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; he was Son of <HI>William Bures,</HI> who paid respective Aid for part of a Knights-fee, which lay in <HI>Bromley,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; and <HI>William Bures</HI> Son of <HI>John</HI> lies entombed in <HI>Halsted</HI> Church, pourtraied at length in Brass, and mail'd in Armor upon a fair Grave-stone, being Marble, with this Inscription: <HI>Hic jacet Willielmus Bures Armigeri Dominus Manerii de Hal∣sted, qui obiit</HI> 1454. And this was he who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth: But after his Death it was not long in the Fruition of this Name; for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, I find it in the Hands of <HI>Thomas Bourchier,</HI> descended from the <HI>Bourchiers</HI> of <HI>Essex;</HI> and he about the Latter End of that Prince, passed it away to <HI>Stephen Petley</HI> Esquire, who lies buried in <HI>Hal∣sted</HI> Church. And in this Family was the Title fixed, untill the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> and then the Fatality of Sale did alternate the Possession, and annexed it to the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Thomas Watson,</HI> who dying without Issue-male; his only Daughter and Heir was espoused to Sir <HI>William Pope,</HI> afterwards created Earl of <HI>Downe</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> by King <HI>James,</HI> and so in her Right this Mannor became the Inheritance of his Son, the Right Honourable <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Downe,</HI> who not many years since passed it away to Mr. <HI>Edward Ash,</HI> whose Widow Mrs. ........ <HI>Ash,</HI> holds it at this instant in Right of Dower.</P>
<P><HI>Halstow</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> hath nothing memorable in it, but <HI>Berkesore alias Basser-court,</HI> which was, as high as any print of Antiquity can direct me to dis∣cover, the Patrimony of the Church; for King <HI>Stephen</HI> devoted it to find a supply of perpetual Lights before the Chest or Shrine (<HI>ante Capsam,</HI> those are the words of the Record) of <HI>Anselme</HI> the eminent Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and it hath been many years past held by the <HI>Darrels</HI> of <HI>Cale-hill</HI> as Lessees, and is still by that Right enjoyed by Sir <HI>John Darrell</HI> of the same place.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Halstow,</HI> (as the Records of Christ-church instruct us) was given by <HI>Boniface</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to buy Books, for the Chaunter of that Covent.</P>
<PB N="178" REF="97"/>
<P><HI>Hamme</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> was, as the Records of Christ-church in <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> inform me, given to the Prior and Monks of that Covent in the year 934. by one <HI>Eylfleda;</HI> but how it was rated in the Conqueror's Time, when, if not all, yet at least the principal part of this County was surveyed, the <HI>Pages</HI> of Doomes∣day Book are silent: In brief, the Moity of this Mannor, (for one Half of it was alwaies under the Jurisdiction of Lay-proprietaries) being by the Donation above∣said, made parcel of the Spiritual Patrimony, remained treasured up in the Re∣venue of the Church, as in an unviolable Exchequer, until both the Covent of Christ-church, and all its Demeasne, was surrendered into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and that Prince in the thirty fifth year of his Raign, granted that part of it which belonged to the Priory of Christ-church to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> who not long after passed it away to Sir <HI>Robert Oxenbridge</HI> Knight, from which Family in our Grand-fathers memory it went away by Sale to <HI>Bois</HI> of <HI>Betshanger.</HI></P>
<P>The other Moity of <HI>Hamme,</HI> belonged to the <HI>Criolls</HI> of <HI>Walmer,</HI> of which Family I shall speak more at that Place: <HI>Simon de Crioll,</HI> as I discover by old Deeds, held it in the Raign of King <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and transmitted it to his Son <HI>Nicolas de Crioll,</HI> who held it at his Death, which was in the one and thirtieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and from him did it by the steps of several Generations descend to Sir <HI>Thomas Crioll,</HI> who was slain at the second Battle of Sr. <HI>Albans,</HI> tamely, and in cold Blood; that is, he was beheaded by Queen <HI>Margaret,</HI> wife to King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the thirty eighth of that Prince's Raign, because he had been an eager Partisan of the House of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and being thus infortunately cut off, left that great Estate he was possest of, in this County, to two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which was matched for his second wife to <HI>John Fogg</HI> of <HI>Repton</HI> Esq; Son and Heir of Sir <HI>William Fogg,</HI> and he had Issue by her <HI>Thomas Fogg,</HI> Serjeant Porter of <HI>Callis</HI> Esquire, a Place of eminent Trust and Concernment in those Times. And he ended in two Daughters and Co-heirs; <HI>Anne</HI> first matched to Mr. <HI>William Scott,</HI> Brother of Sir <HI>Reginald;</HI> and secondly, to Mr. <HI>Henry Isham,</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> first wedded to <HI>Edward Scott,</HI> of the <HI>Moat</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> Esquire, and after to Sir <HI>Robert Oxenbridge,</HI> of the County of <HI>South-hampton;</HI> but the Moity of this Mannor of <HI>Hamme,</HI> upon the dividing the Estate into equal Portions, fell to be the Inheritance of <HI>Edward Scott,</HI> in Right of <HI>Alice</HI> his wife, and his Descendant in our Grand-fathers Remembrance alienated all his Interest and Concernment here, to <HI>Bois</HI> of <HI>Betshanger,</HI> whose Successor Mr. <HI>John Bois</HI> of <HI>Betshanger</HI> Esquire, is now entirely possest of this Mannor; as namely, of that Moity, which came over to this Family, by Purchase from <HI>Oxenbridge,</HI> as well as of that, which devolved to this Name, by Purchase from <HI>Scott.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harbledowne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Westgate,</HI> though at present but an obscure Village, and not of much Eminence, was in Time of more ancient Date famous for three memorable Places. First, for an old Chappel situated upon the Margin of that Precipice which overlooks that way which leads to <HI>Canterbury.</HI> In which Oratory, as Tradition informs us, was preserved the Slipper of <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> taken from one of his Feet after his being destroyed at his own Church at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and which, as Report insinuates, was bespattered with his Blood; this being curiously enchased with Diamonds (so much did those Times dote on this then reputed Saint and Mar∣tyr) was let down for Passengers, who travelled to <HI>Canterbury</HI> to offer up their Ori∣zons at his Shrine, to adore with a kiss; nor was it returned, but full fraighted and laden with the Benevolences of devoted Pilgrims.</P>
<P>The second was <HI>Polres,</HI> which anciently had and still keeps the Repute of a Man∣nor; <HI>John de Polre,</HI> Son of <HI>John de Polre</HI> payd respective Aid for it, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and when after some expiration of Time, this Family began to find the common Sepulcher which wairs upon all Humane Glory, Decay and Oblivion; the <HI>Martins,</HI> a Name of generous extraction in this Track, stept in and by Purchase became Lords of the Fee, and held it, till the Name being con∣tracted into <HI>Anne</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir of <HI>Jo. Martin</HI> by marriage with <HI>Roger Brent;</HI> it was knit to the Patrimony of that Family, and so for some years remained un∣dissolved, till the Union by Sale was broken; and not long since passed over to
<PB N="179" REF="97"/>Sir <HI>Thomas Bind;</HI> where, at present, the Possession is wound up with the other De∣measne of that Family.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Beverley</HI> is a third place of Note in <HI>Harbledowne.</HI> It was the Sear of the ancient Family of <HI>Beverley,</HI> before they removed to <HI>Tancrey</HI> Island in <HI>Ford∣wich;</HI> and having remained Proprietaries of it many Generations, by Efflux and Descent it was guided down to <HI>William Beverley</HI> Esquite, from whom the Title eb∣bed away, and in whom the Name determined; for, he deceasing without Issue Male, <HI>Beatrix</HI> was his only Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Thomas Nor∣ton</HI> Esquire, by which Alliance, the Title of this place became inter-woven with his Inheritance, and continued clasped up in it, until the middle of the Raign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to <HI>Merseday,</HI> in which Family it had a setled Residence, until some sew years since the Mutation of Sale brought it to one Mr. ....... <HI>Richardson</HI> for its Proprietary.</P>
<P><HI>Lanfranck,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the year 1071. Founded an Hospital at <HI>Harbledowne</HI> for Lepers, employed afterwards to the Use of aged people. <HI>William Wittlesey</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the year 1371. founded a Chauntry here, and de∣dicated it to the Honor of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> which Foundation, in the year 1402. Was by Arch-bishop <HI>Arundell</HI> fully ratified and confirmed.</P>
<P><HI>Nether-Hardres</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bridge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> is eminent for two Places situ∣ated within the Precincts and Ambuts of it. The first is <HI>Hepington,</HI> which certainly was anciently the <HI>Chichs</HI> of the <HI>Dungeon</HI> in <HI>Canterbury;</HI> for I have seen a Record, wherein <HI>Nicolas Mesingham</HI> releases his Right in this and divers other Lands confining on <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> to <HI>Tho. Chich.</HI> But let it be granted, it was theirs; certainly the Title was very vo∣latile and incertain; for I find the <HI>Foggs</HI> when they expired, to be next in Possession of it, which was as high as the entrance into the Raign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the fourth. And here for some Ages the Title fixt it self, till at length the Fatality of Time passed it over by Sale to <HI>Hales,</HI> one of whose Successors has lately sold the Mansion House to Sir <HI>Thomas Godfrey,</HI> but still preserves the Propriety of the Mannor it self in his Name.</P>
<P><HI>Lindeshore,</HI> but vulgarly called <HI>Linsore,</HI> is the second Place that Objects it self to a Consideration. In the eighth of Edward the third an Original Fine represents it to be <HI>Thomas de Garwinton's;</HI> and here many years the Possession was resident, till <HI>Joan</HI> his Niece, became (by Reason her Nephew <HI>Thomas Garwinton,</HI> Grand-child to this <HI>Thomas de Garwinton</HI> died without Issue) the Heir General of this Family, and she being married to <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> a Cadet of the <HI>Hauts</HI> of <HI>Hautsborne, alias Bishops-Bourne,</HI> made this, part of their Demeasne; but this Name not long after concluding in <HI>Margery Haut,</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir to <HI>Richard Haut;</HI> she be∣ing made the wife of <HI>William Isaack</HI> of <HI>Blackmansbery</HI> in <HI>Bridge,</HI> involved this in her Husbands Revenue, to which, after it had been some time united, it was by Sale from this Family carried over to <HI>John Brent</HI> Esquire: and this Name, some narrow Distance of Time after resolving into a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Margaret,</HI> who was married to <HI>John Dering,</HI> this became part of his Estate, and so continued till his Successor not long since sold it to <HI>Young</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ʋpper</HI> or <HI>High Hardres,</HI> call it which you please, is placed in the Hundreds of <HI>Bridge, Petham,</HI> and <HI>Lovingborough,</HI> and gave name to a Family which certainly was of <HI>Saxon</HI>-extraction, being compounded of two <HI>Saxon</HI> words; <HI>Erd,</HI> which signifies <HI>Earth;</HI> and <HI>Reys,</HI> which signifies <HI>Rivulets</HI> or <HI>small Drils of water.</HI> And, more to esta∣blish this Opinion, the Record of Doomes-day Book informs us, that <HI>Rodbertus de Hardres</HI> held half a Sulling or Ploughed-land in <HI>Liminge,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror: this man was Ancestor to <HI>Philip de Hardres,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae,</HI> in the Raign of King <HI>John,</HI> and his Son <HI>Philip de Hardres</HI> was a man of that Eminence under the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, that he matched with <HI>Grace,</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Stephen de Harengod;</HI> and I have seen an old Deed, which bears the form of a Latine Will, wherein this <HI>Stephen</HI> settles his Mannor of <HI>Elmested,</HI> and other Lands in this Track upon this <HI>Phi∣lip de Hardres;</HI> which Deed, though not dated, certainly relates to the Time of his Decease, which was in the one and fortieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 23.
<PB N="180" REF="98"/>But though this Mannor gave Sirname to <HI>Hardres;</HI> yet I find some others had an Interest in it, or at least some part of it, before it absolutely and solely came to confesse the Signory of this Name: <HI>Oliver de Bohun</HI> obtained a Charter of Free∣warren to his Lands at <HI>High Hardres,</HI> in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, which was renued to <HI>Nicolas de Hadlow</HI> or <HI>Hallow,</HI> who had not long before purchased the Inheritance of the above said Family at this place, in the one and twentieth year of the above mentioned Prince; but about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find this Family quite dislodged from this place, and the Sole Demeasne and Pro∣priety wrapped up in the Family of <HI>Hardres:</HI> one of whom, by Name <HI>Henry Har∣dres,</HI> was one of the Justices of the Peace for this County, in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth; and from him, is descended Sir <HI>Richard Hardres,</HI> now Lord of this Mannor, who by a Title riveted and incorporated into him by a Chain of many uninterrupted Descents, does now claim the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Southcourt</HI> is another little Mannor in <HI>Upper Hardres,</HI> which in elder Times was entituled to the Propriety of <HI>Garwinton,</HI> a Family of signal Estimate and deep Root in this Track; for in an old Pedigree of <HI>Isaac,</HI> I discover that <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>William de Garwinton,</HI> were in the List of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen that accompanied <HI>Henry</HI> the third in his Expedition into <HI>Gascony,</HI> in the thirty seventh year of his Raign, which Design by the ill Conduct of his Affairs, and worse Managery of his Arms, was very ruinous and full of dysaster, to that Prince: But this Family, about the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth (as I have shewed in <HI>Bekesbourne</HI>) being ex∣tinguished without Issue; the Heir General brought this Mannor to be possest by <HI>Haut,</HI> from whom some two Descents after, the same Fatality brought it to be en∣joyed by <HI>Isaac,</HI> in whom the Propriety was resident, until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was conveyed to <HI>Diggs,</HI> a Family which had some Interest in it (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and some Descents before; and from this Name not long after the same Alienation carried it off to <HI>Hales</HI> of the <HI>Dungeon,</HI> in which Family it hath remained so constant, that it is the instant propriety of Mr. ..... <HI>Hales,</HI> a yonger Branch of that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Hartlip</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton</HI> hath divers places of Account in it: First, <HI>Gore Court,</HI> which was, in Times of an elder Aspect, the Inheritance of a Family of that Appellation: and I find that <HI>Henry</HI> at <HI>Gore</HI> held it at his Decease, in the one and thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and remained with the Demeasne of this Name, until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and then it was transmitted by Sale to <HI>Werdecre</HI> or <HI>Werdegar,</HI> and here it fixt, until the seventeenth year of King <HI>James:</HI> and then <HI>William Werdegar,</HI> Son of <HI>George Werdegar,</HI> passed it away to Sir <HI>Nicholas Tufton,</HI> whose Son and Heir <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> is now the Owner of it. <HI>Juliana de Leybourne</HI> had some Estate here at <HI>Gore Court,</HI> which, at her Decease, in the three and fortieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, escheating with the Remainder of her Estate to the Crown, was by that Prince, in the fiftieth year of his Govern∣ment, settled upon the Abby of St. <HI>Mary Grace</HI> on Tower-hill, which he had be∣fore founded in the twenty fourth year of his Raign, and lay involved in the Pa∣trimony of that Cloister, until the general suppression, and then it was granted by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to <HI>William Werdegar,</HI> whose Successor sold it with that part of it, which was alwaies of secular Interest, to Sir <HI>Nicolas Tufton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Popes-hall</HI> in this Parish had Owners likewise of that Sirname, who likewise were entituled to some Estate at <HI>Gaesden</HI> in <HI>Tenterden,</HI> and continued Lords of this Seat, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was by <HI>Richard Pope</HI> Gentleman, transmitted by Sale to <HI>Christopher Bloer,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir called <HI>Olympia Bloer,</HI> it devolved to be the Inheritance of Mr. <HI>John Tufton</HI> Ance∣stor to the Right Honorable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet,</HI> now Possessor of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ealgar</HI> or <HI>Ealdigar,</HI> now vulgarly by melting away the L, called <HI>Eager Court</HI> or <HI>Eagar Croft,</HI> was anciently, as appears by several old Deeds without Date, the Patrimony of <HI>William de Elmested,</HI> but continued not long in this Family; for in the thirteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, I find it folded up in the Inheritance of <HI>Roger de Northwood,</HI> and in this Name the Title was resident until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was transplanted by Sale into <HI>Norton</HI> of <HI>Borden,</HI> from whom
<PB N="181" REF="98"/>in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, part of it was passed away by Sale to <HI>Champneys,</HI> and in the eighth year of that Prince, the Remainder was by the same Fatality, brought to confesse the Signory of the above-mentioned Family, from whom, <HI>Thomas Rider,</HI> held it in Lease, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; and in the seventeenth year of that Prince, passed away all his Interest and concernment in it to <HI>Mark Harris,</HI> but the Propriety of this place, continued still in <HI>Champneys.</HI> And from him, did part of it, in the twenty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passe back again by Sale to <HI>Norton,</HI> and the Remainder in the thirty second year of that King's raign, was by the same conveyance wholly remitted to the above re∣cited Family, and made its aboad here untill the fourth and fifth year of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary;</HI> and then <HI>John Norton,</HI> by Sale conveyed his Right in it, to <HI>Gilbert Fremlin,</HI> and he in the fifteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated all his Con∣cernment in it, to <HI>John Palmer</HI> Esquire, Father of Sir <HI>Anthony Palmer,</HI> and Grand∣father of <HI>Dudley Palmer</HI> Esquire, the instant Possessor of it.</P>
<P>There is a Mannor in this Parish, vulgarly and corruptly called <HI>Grayney,</HI> but in old Deeds <HI>Graveney,</HI> as being indeed the Patrimony of a Family of that Sirname: of which Stem was <HI>Stephen de Graveney,</HI> whom, as private Record informs me, held it in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and in his Descendants, I find it successively constant and fixed, untill the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. And from that Prince's Rule, I must make a leap to the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then I find it in the Tenure of <HI>John Mayney</HI> of <HI>Biddenden</HI> Esquire, great Grandfather of Sir <HI>John Mayney</HI> of <HI>Linton</HI> Knight and Baronet, the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Hartley</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> made up a part of that Patrimony, which came within the Circle of that Revenue, which owned for Proprietaries the Lords <HI>Mont∣chensey,</HI> whose capitall Seat was at <HI>Swanscamp,</HI> where I shall treat more largely of them; but it seems they had a special regard to this Mannor, for <HI>Warren de Montchensey,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to <HI>Hartley</HI> in the thirty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it enobled and secured with this Franchise to his only Son, <HI>William de Montchensey,</HI> who dying without Issue, <HI>Joan</HI> his Sister and Heir by marching with <HI>William de Valence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> entituled him to this Mannor, and she held it at her Death, which was in the first year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the second: from whom it devolved to her Son <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> who dying without Issue-male in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> second; <HI>Isabell de Valence</HI> his Heir Generall, united it to the Inheritance of her Husband <HI>Lawrence de Hastings,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> from whom it came down to his Grandchild <HI>John de Hastings.</HI> And he deceasing without Issue, in the year 1389, left it to his Kinsman <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> and he brings a pleading for this and other Land, against <HI>John le Scroope,</HI> in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, as appears by the Book of <HI>Dover</HI> in the Exchequer, he was peaceably fixed in the Possession, and was a person of considerable Rank and importance in those Times, for he bore a pair of gilt Spurs at the Coronation of the abovesaid Prince. But no eminence of Birth or Dignity can chain the Possession of a place to a Family, when the Title leans upon the Wheel of an inconstant and ebbing Estate. For the Revolution of Sale about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, carried it from this Name to <HI>Penhale,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Em∣ma Penhale,</HI> as appears by the Book of <HI>Dover</HI> in the Exchequer, held it in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, but the Propriety was not long constant in this Family: for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, I find it in the Te∣nure of <HI>Cressell,</HI> but it was not long permanent in this Family neither: for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was by Sale transplanted into <HI>Ballard,</HI> and here the Possession rested untill the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; and then it was alienated to <HI>William Sydley</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to Sir <HI>Charles Sydley</HI> Baronet, who now is entituled to the Right and Propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hastingleigh</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bircholt,</HI> did anciently confesse the noble Fami∣ly of <HI>Haut,</HI> to be its Proprietaries, and was in their Possession untill the begin∣ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then <HI>Edward Haut</HI> passed it away to <HI>Robert Poy∣nings</HI>
<PB N="182" REF="99"/>of <HI>Ostenhanger,</HI> and in the Revenue of this Family was enwrapt, untill the Decease of Sir <HI>Edward Poynings;</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and he dying without any Issue of his Body lawfully begotten, (and there being none that could justly entitle himself by Right of Blood or Alliance to his Possessions) it devolved by Escheat to the Crown, and K. <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, in the last year of his reign, by Royal Concession invested the Right of this Mannor in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and there it is still resident.</P>
<P><HI>Hawkherst</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Barnefield,</HI> was granted by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour to the Mannor of <HI>Wye,</HI> which with all its Appendages, was to hold of the Abby of <HI>Battle,</HI> and remains (though that Abby be supprest) a Member or Limb of that Court to this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Congerherst</HI> in this Parish, was a Mansion that formerly gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, and which in a Successive Series did relate to this Name, untill <HI>Mildred Congerherst,</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir of <HI>Thomas Congerherst,</HI> matching with <HI>Thomas Scott,</HI> made this the Propriety of that Family, to which it is still united.</P>
<P>The Royalty and Rents of <HI>Haukherst</HI> upon the Suppression of the Abby of <HI>Bat∣tle,</HI> were in the thirty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>He was likewise Privy∣counsellor to those three Prin∣ces, and one of the Executors of</HI> Henry <HI>the eighths Will.</HI></NOTE> Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Attorney Generall, and Chancellor of the Exchequer to that Prince, King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> but Differences and Clashings, breaking out between the Descendant of Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> and the Heir of the Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> Lord of <HI>Wye,</HI> touching claims; to bury all future Animosities in Amity and mutual Com∣pliance, Sir <HI>Henry Baker,</HI> in the seventeenth year of King <HI>James,</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Dover;</HI> who some years since, passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> Father to <HI>Heneage</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> now Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Haukherst</HI> had a Market anciently, now shrunk into Disuse, on the Tuesday, and a yearly Fair three Days, <HI>viz.</HI> the Vigil, the Day of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> and the Day subsequent to it, both procured by the Abbot of <HI>Battle,</HI> (as the original patent instructs me) in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first.</P>
<P><HI>Hawking</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Folkstone</HI> contains two little Mannors within its Verge, which must not be passed over in Silence. The first is <HI>Bilchester,</HI> which belonged to the Knights Templers, but upon their Suppression, in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, it escheated to the Crown, and remained there untill new provision was made, by the Statute called <HI>Statutum de Terris Templariorum,</HI> passed in the seventeenth year of the abovesaid Prince, to enstate it on the Knights Hospitalers, and make it part of their Revenue, and accordingly was united to their Patrimony, nor was any hand so bold as to tear it off; untill the generall Suppression of this Order, in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, did invest it in the Crown: and that Prince in the thirty third year of his Reign granted it to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher</HI> in Lease: and he not long after, assigned it to <HI>Thomas Sommersall,</HI> by whom it was made over to <HI>Richard Simonds,</HI> but the Fee-simple continued in the Crown, untill the year 1648.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Fleggs Court,</HI> which was folded up in that Demeasne, which re∣lated to the Abby of St. <HI>Radigunds,</HI> and upon the Suppression of that Cloister, was exchanged by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, for o∣ther Lands with <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and so remained free from violation, untill these Times wrapt it up in the Demeasne of that See.</P>
<P><HI>Hedcorne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> containd within its Limits, First <HI>Moden∣den,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Mottenden,</HI> where was a Monastery for Monks of the Order of <HI>Crouched Friers,</HI> and founded by Sir <HI>Ric. de Rokesley:</HI> the Head of which Covent, was called Minister, and in the cloudy Times of Popery, was much resorted unto by the enchanted Vulgar, by reason of some special Priviledges they were endowed with, as of granting of pardons, and others of the like Nature: all which met with their Sepulcher in the Ruine of this Abbey, and that fatall and destructive Wound it received in its finall Dissolution, from the Hand of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth,
<PB N="183" REF="99"/>which Prince, upon its escheating to the Crown, granted it in the thirty sixth year of his Government, to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher.</HI> And he, in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, passed it away to Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> by whose Daughter and Coheir it came to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury</HI> Esquire; who in the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, conveyed it to <HI>Christopher Sackvill</HI> Esquire, from which Fami∣ly in our Grand-fathers Remembrance it came over by Sale to <HI>Franklin;</HI> and his Successor <HI>George Franklin</HI> dying without Issue, bequeathed it by Testament to his Kinsman Sir <HI>William Sydley,</HI> whose Grand-child Sir <HI>Charles Sydley</HI> Baronet, is in∣tituled to the instant Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Kents Chauntry</HI> is a second Place of Account in <HI>Headcorne,</HI> called so because here was a <HI>Chauntry</HI> founded by one <HI>John Kent,</HI> in the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and a large Demeasne settled upon it, to support the <HI>Chauntry</HI> Priest that was to offi∣ciate there; all which upon the suppression was in the two and thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger,</HI> about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away by Sale to <HI>Be∣resford</HI> of <HI>Westernham,</HI> from which Family in our Memory it went away to <HI>South∣land;</HI> and he very lately hath alienated it to Mr. ...... <HI>Belcher,</HI> now Minister of Gods Word at <HI>Ulcombe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kelsham</HI> is a third Seat in this Parish, which may challenge our Consideration; because it was the Residence formerly (though now transformed into a Farm-house) of Gentlemen known by this Sirname, who might have been ranged and marshal∣led amongst the prime Gentlemen of this County, and bare for their Coat-<HI>Armour Sable,</HI> a <HI>Fesse</HI> engrailed <HI>Argent,</HI> between three <HI>Garbes, Or.</HI> One of them stood depicted in coloured Glasse in the Church windows, with his <HI>Arms</HI> upon his <HI>Tabard;</HI> but by the Assaults of Age, and other wild and sacrilegious Impressions, is now utterly defaced and demolished; nor is the Family in any better condition, that having many years since deserted the Possession of this Place; for about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it was conveyed to <HI>Johnson:</HI> from whom very lately, it is come over by Purchase to <HI>Stringer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rishford</HI> is a fourth Mannor circumscribed within the Bounds of <HI>Headcorne,</HI> which in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was possest by a Family called <HI>Pend,</HI> who (as it appears by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) paid a respective supply for it, at making the Black Prince Knight. And here is much Land in this Parish, which bears the Name of <HI>Pend,</HI> a probable Argument of the Antiquity of it in this Track: nor did it yeild to Time, or desert the Possession of this Place, but was constant in the Tenure of it, until that Age we call our Grand-fathers, and then it was alie∣nated to a Family called <HI>Dominie, alias Fullaker;</HI> the last of which Name at this Place was <HI>Christopher Dominie, alias Fullaker,</HI> who not many years since passed it away to Mr. <HI>John Hulks</HI> of <HI>Newenham,</HI> whose Son and Heir Mr. <HI>Stephen Hulks,</HI> does now possesse the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Herietsham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was anciently a Limb of that Estate which was entituled to the Possession of the Noble Family of <HI>Crescy: Hugh de Crescy</HI> died seised of the Mannor, in the forty seventh year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and his Grand-mother <HI>Margery</HI> was Daughter of <HI>William de Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Patricks∣bourne Cheyney,</HI> as appears <HI>Claus.</HI> 52. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 6. <HI>in Dorso.</HI> But he de∣ceased without Issue, and so his Brother <HI>Stephen de Crescy</HI> became his Heir and Lord of <HI>Herietsham,</HI> and in this Family it continued until the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and then the Possession of this Place went from <HI>Crescy</HI> into <HI>Northwood,</HI> as is manifest by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> where <HI>Roger de Northwood</HI> is represented to have held this Mannor, and have paid a proportionate <HI>Aid</HI> for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and he deceased seised of it in the thirty fifth year of that King's Raign. And in this Name it remained fixed until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and then it was transplanted into the Inte∣rest of a Family called <HI>Adam,</HI> who had large Possessions in <HI>Essex,</HI> and bore for their Paternal Coat vert, a <HI>Plain Crosse, Or;</HI> and <HI>John Adam</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the ninteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and left it to his Son <HI>John Adam;</HI> af∣ter whom I do not find any more of the Family possest of it: for in the Raign of
<PB N="184" REF="100"/><HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, I discover by some Court Rols that <HI>James Peckham</HI> of <HI>Yaldham</HI> Esquire, was Lord of the Fee; and <HI>Reginald Peckham</HI> his Son, that was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the last year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, kept his Shrivalty at <HI>Herietsham;</HI> but after this, it was of no long continuance in this Family; for in the fifteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, <HI>Reginald Peckham</HI> passes it away by Sale to <HI>Edward Scott</HI> Esquire, and he not long after transmits it by the same conveyance to <HI>John Hales</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, and from him one Moiety of it went away by Sale, in the twenty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to <HI>John Norton</HI> Esquire; and the other not long after to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger. Norton</HI> conveyed his proportion to <HI>Ashburnham</HI> of <HI>Sussex;</HI> and both <HI>St. Leger</HI> and <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> in the Time almost of our Fathers Remembrance, by a concurrent Sale demised their joint Right in it to Sir <HI>John Steed,</HI> whose Successor, Doctour ...... <HI>Steed,</HI> Doctour of the Civil Law, is the instant Proprietary of <HI>Herietsham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>East Farbon</HI> and <HI>Bentley,</HI> are two little Mannors in this Parish, which belonged to the Priory of <HI>Leeds;</HI> and upon the suppression, were made parcel of the Revenue of the Crown, and remained there until King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, in the fourth year of his Raign, granted them to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> whose great Grand-child Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger,</HI> about the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> passed them away to Mr. ........ <HI>Steed,</HI> Father to Doctour <HI>Steed;</HI> who upon the Decease of his Nephew <HI>Cromer Steed</HI> without Issue Male, as Reversioner in Entail, is now settled in the Possession of these two Mannors.</P>
<P><HI>West Farbon,</HI> sometimes in old Deeds, called little <HI>Herietsham,</HI> lies likewise in this Parish, and was granted in the two and fiftieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, to <HI>William de Valentia,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrooke:</HI> But after him I track no more of the Fa∣mily at this place; For in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, it was held by <HI>John Pennington;</HI> and in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, when <HI>Blanch</HI> that Prince's Daughter was married, it acknow∣ledged it self to be under the Signory of the above mentioned Family, and conti∣nued divers years after united to their Interest: But in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, I find them quite vanished from the Possession, and a Family called <HI>Hede</HI> or <HI>Head,</HI> entituled to the Inheritance; and in this Name did it make its abode, until the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>St. Leger,</HI> where it rested until the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> and then it was alienated by Sir <HI>War∣ham St. Leger</HI> to Mr. <HI>Benedict Barneham,</HI> who left four Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to <HI>Audley, Constable, Doble,</HI> and <HI>Soame,</HI> who equally shared his Estate; and this upon the distinguishing of it into just Proportions, augmented the Re∣venue of <HI>Constable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harbilton</HI> is another ancient Mannor in <HI>Herietsham;</HI> It was, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the Inheritance of <HI>Thomas de Malmains;</HI> for at that Time, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> he paid a subsidiary supply for this and other Lands, at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family was mouldred away, which was before the End of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find the Family of <HI>Maris</HI> was settled in the Inheritance. <HI>William Maris</HI> who was Esquire, first to <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and after to Cardinal <HI>Kempe,</HI> was Possessor of it, and so was his Son <HI>William Maris</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the one and twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. After this Family, I find the <HI>Moils,</HI> about the latter end of the former Prince's Government, to have stept into the Inheritance; the first of which was <HI>Walter Moile,</HI> who was Justice of the Peace for this County, in the Raign both of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth and <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and left this, and a spatious Patrimony besides, to his Heir <HI>John Moile</HI> Esquire, whose Son <HI>Robert Moile,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, alienated it to <HI>Geffrey St. Leger</HI> Esquire, from whom the Title for many years streamed into this Family, until in that Time, which fell under our Grand-fathers cognizance, it was passed away by Sale to <HI>Steed,</HI> Ancestor to Do∣ctour <HI>Steed,</HI> who is the instant Possessor of it.</P>

<PB N="185" REF="100"/>English Writers, there is mention of one <HI>Joannes de Teneth,</HI> a Man as exemplary for his Piety, as he was eminent for his Learning, who was Chaunter to that Covent; but this Office being entombed in the Ruines of those Canons of <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Gene∣ral suppression; the Revenue which upheld it, was fixed in the Crown, until King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth granted both these Places to Sir <HI>Edward VVotton,</HI> one of his Privy Councel, whose Grand-child Sir <HI>Thomas VVotton,</HI> was by King <HI>James</HI> invested with the Dignity and Title of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>VVotton</HI> of <HI>Marley,</HI> and was by <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton</HI> his Son, settled in Marriage upon his Daughter <HI>Katherine VVotton</HI> with <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> Son and Heir apparent to <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Chesterfeild,</HI> and is at this instant in relation to the former settlement devolved in Abeyance to her Son, the Right Honorable <HI>Philip Stanhop,</HI> the present Earl of <HI>Chesterfeild.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hern</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blengate,</HI> has nothing memorable in it but <HI>Haw-house,</HI> a Limb or portion of that wide Demeasne that the eminent Family of <HI>Apulderfield</HI> held in this Track; and when this Name that had been deeply rooted in Antiquity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hern <HI>had a Market procured to be held there week∣ly on the Monday: and a Fair yearly upon the Vigil, and Day of St.</HI> Martin, <HI>by the Arch∣bishop of</HI> Cant. <HI>in the twenty fifth of</HI> Ed. <HI>the third as appears</HI> Cart. Num. 31.</NOTE> and had spread to a large extent, in the Latitude of it, was circumscribed in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Eliz.</HI> matched with Sir <HI>Jo. Phineux:</HI> this Seat was made by Female In∣terest, an Addition to the Income of this Family, and here it remained undivi∣ded from it, till this Name determined in <HI>John Phineux</HI> Esqu; issued from a youn∣ger Line of this Family, who left only one Daughter and Heir, married to Sir <HI>John Smith,</HI> Grandfather to <HI>Philip</HI> Viscount <HI>Strangford,</HI> who in relation to that Right this Match has invested in him, is now the instant Proprietary.</P>
<P><HI>Seas</HI> or <HI>At Seas Court</HI> is likewise involved within the Sphere and Limits of this Parish: it was in Records anciently styl'd so, though now through Disuse it be lan∣guished into an Intermission, having lost its Name, and the Estimate of a Man∣nor likewise. For a Succession of some Ages, it owned the Name and Interest of <HI>At Sea,</HI> till Fate and Time, that are the common Sepulchre of Families, by Sale gave up the Fee-simple, an Age or two since, to <HI>Knowler,</HI> whose Heir does yet en∣title himself by Right of his Predecessours purchase, to the Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hernehill</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Boughton,</HI> has two Places in it, which may make it remarkable: First, <HI>Durgall Stroude,</HI> which was, in Times of higher Track, the <HI>Martin's</HI> a very noble and illustrious Family in this Territory, whose capital or principal Seat was at <HI>Graveney,</HI> not far distant: and here, after it had flourisht, by the Decursion of some Ages, it fell into a Daughter and Heir, called <HI>Margaret,</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir to <HI>Matthew Martin,</HI> who was married to <HI>William Norton</HI> of <HI>Cokesdish</HI> in <HI>Feversham,</HI> and in her Right did he become Proprietary of this Man∣nor, from whose Heir <HI>Thomas Norton,</HI> the Property or Fee-simple was by Sale trans∣ferred into the Possession of Sir <HI>John Wild</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to whose Heirs General the Propriety of this Mannor does at present relate.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is another Seat in this Parish, vulgarly called <HI>Apes Court, alias Lockley;</HI> but, indeed, in truer Orthography writ <HI>Epes-Court,</HI> a place so despicable, that it had not been worth the Memoriall, but that in all the circumstances of pro∣bability the <HI>Epes</HI>'s of <HI>Canterbury</HI> assumed, if not Seat, yet at least Sirname from thence; and it is the more possible, because the <HI>Epes's</HI> have been ancient Tenants to the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for the Mannor of <HI>Seas-alter,</HI> divided by a neer Distance from this place; in Ages of a more modern Date, the <HI>Nevinsons</HI> were the Lords of the Fee, and certainly this was their ancient Mansion, before they were trans∣planted to <HI>Eastry;</HI> this being sold in the Raign of King <HI>James</HI> by Sir <HI>Roger Nevinson</HI> to Sir <HI>John Wild</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in whose Heirs General (<HI>Dudley Wild</HI> Esquire, his only surviving Son being lately deceased without Issue) the Possession continues fixed.</P>
<P><HI>Hever</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Somerden</HI> and <HI>Ruxley,</HI> had in elder Times a Castle,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See more of this Fami∣ly at</HI> North∣fleet.</NOTE> which was the Capital Seat or Mannor built by <HI>Thomas de Hever,</HI> who had liberty by the Charter of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, granted to him in the fourth of his Raign, not only to embattle his Mansion here, but likewise had Free-warren annexed to his Lands in this place. <HI>William Hever</HI> deceased without Issue Male, and left only two
<PB N="186" REF="101"/>Daughters and Co-heirs; <HI>Joane</HI> married to <HI>Reginald Cobham</HI> of <HI>Sterborough,</HI> and the other wedded to <HI>Brocas,</HI> whence in Records it is sometimes called <HI>Hever Cobham</HI> and <HI>Hever Brocas,</HI> and when the <HI>Cobhams</HI> went out, the <HI>Bullens</HI> were the immedi∣ate Purchasers; for <HI>Geffrey Bullen</HI> purchased this Place, and his Grand-child Sir <HI>Thomas Bullen</HI> Knight of the Garter, and Earl of <HI>VVilts,</HI> lived here, who was Father to <HI>Anne Bullen,</HI> Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and as he had here his Habitation, so likewise he has here his Sepulcher, and lieth emtombed in <HI>Hever-church;</HI> but when his Son <HI>George</HI> Viscount <HI>Rochford,</HI> upon pretence of some black Crimes acted against the Majesty of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, fell under the Censure of High Trea∣son; this upon his Attainder or Conviction was escheated to the Crown, and be∣gan to be reputed a Mansion of some Estimate, when <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Cleve</HI> for some Time lived here, and made it her residence; but, in Times subsequent to this, I find it eminent for nothing, till King <HI>James</HI> granted it to Sir <HI>Edward Waldgrave,</HI> whose Successor yet possesses it.</P>
<P><HI>Heys</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> was formerly under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Squirries,</HI> a Family under a signal Notion of Eminence in this part of the County, and was concluded some Ages within their Patrimony, till it was bounded by two Daughters and Co-heirs; one of which called <HI>Dorothy,</HI> was married to <HI>Richard Mervin,</HI> the other styled <HI>Margaret,</HI> matched to Sir <HI>William Cromer,</HI> who in Right of their Father <HI>Thomas Squirrie,</HI> who held <HI>Heys</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, entituled themselves to vast Possessions in these parts; but this Mannor upon the Division accrued to <HI>Mervin,</HI> and in his Posterity some years it found an abode, till by Sale the Interest was transmitted to <HI>Peche;</HI> but Sir <HI>John Peche</HI> de∣ceasing without any Issue Male, his only Daughter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> married to <HI>John Hart</HI> Esq; extracted from the <HI>Harts</HI> of the County of <HI>Hertford,</HI> was found to be his Heir, and in Relation to that Mixture, or conjunction, does this Family yet continue Pro∣prietaries of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hinxhill</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> was part of that Estate which belonged to the Family of <HI>Strabolgie,</HI> Earls of <HI>Atholl;</HI> but whether or not it de∣volved to <HI>Alexander Balioll,</HI> Earl of <HI>Atholl</HI> by <HI>Isabell</HI> his Wife, one of the Co-heirs of <HI>Richard de Dover,</HI> Lord of <HI>Chilham,</HI> is altogether incertain; because no Re∣cord that I ever yet saw, reaches beyond the above mentioned <HI>Alexander;</HI> this mans Son was <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Strabolgie</HI> and <HI>Athol,</HI> who having forfeited it in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, whilst he endevoured to buoy up the Liberty of his Country of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which then seemed to be sunk in its own Ruines, being trampled upon by the succesful Attempts of that Prince, it for some years encrea∣sed the Royal Revenue, until <HI>David de Strabolgie,</HI> Earl of <HI>Atholl,</HI> the first that altered his Name from <HI>Balioll</HI> to <HI>Strabolgie,</HI> having expiated his Fathers Disservices, by being constant to the Party and Interest of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, against the Eruptions of the Nobility, which then bandied in Combinations against him, had this with much other Land, restored to him in the fifteenth year of that Prince; from whom it descended to <HI>David de Strabolgie</HI> his Grand-child, who dying in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, left it to <HI>Philippa</HI> his Daughter and Co-heir matched to <HI>John Halsham</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> by whom she had Issue <HI>Hugh Halsham,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, passed it away to Sir <HI>Robert Scott,</HI> Liev∣tenant of the Tower of London 1424. And he concluding in <HI>Alice Scott,</HI> a Female Inheritrix, she by matching with <HI>William Kempe,</HI> Nephew of Cardinal <HI>Kempe,</HI> linked it to the Demeasne of that Family, and here it remained until Sir <HI>William Kempe,</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, alienated it to <HI>Browning,</HI> from which Family, about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it passed away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Robert Edolph,</HI> whose Grand-child Mr. <HI>Robert Edolph</HI> dying in the year 1632. without Issue, gave his Interest in it with <HI>Godchepes</HI> to his beloved Wife: <HI>Cicelie Edolph</HI> remarried to Sir <HI>Francis Knowls</HI> of <HI>Reading,</HI> and she passed away the Moiety of it (the other proportion of it being invested in Mr. <HI>Thomas Edolph</HI> the third Bro∣ther) with <HI>Godchepes,</HI> now called <HI>Goodchepes,</HI> to her Husbands second Brother, Mr. <HI>Samuel Edolph,</HI> who some few years since conveyed his Interest in <HI>Hinxhill</HI> with
<PB N="187" REF="101"/>this by Testament to his Brother in Law Mr. <HI>John Angell</HI> of <HI>Croherst</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> to discharge Debts and Legacies; and he, that he might the more effectually per∣form the Contents of the Will, hath lately passed away the Moiety of <HI>Hinxhill</HI> with <HI>Goodchepes,</HI> to <HI>Edward Chowte</HI> of <HI>Surrenden Chowte</HI> in <HI>Bethersden</HI> Esquire, lately deceased.</P>
<P><HI>W. liham</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Hinxhill,</HI> which was folded up in the vast Demeasne of <HI>Crioll,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir it came to <HI>Rokesley,</HI> and by the Female In∣heritrix of <HI>Rokesley</HI> to <HI>Poynings:</HI> in which Name it continued until the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then Sir <HI>Edward Poynings</HI> dying without any lawful Issue; after a signal and solemne Inspection, by several Inquisitions into his colla∣teral Alliance, no Claim being laid unto his Estate, this Mannor escheated to the Crown, in the fourteenth year of that Prince, and then King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by Grant passed it away to Sir <HI>Richard Damsell,</HI> who not long after transmitted his Right in it to <HI>Goldhill,</HI> who in our Grand-fathers Memory alienated it to Mr. <HI>Ro∣bert Edolph,</HI> whose Grand-child Mr. <HI>Robert Edolph</HI> gave it with his Interest in <HI>Hinx∣hill</HI> and <HI>Goodchepes</HI> to his Wife <HI>Cicelie Edolph,</HI> who passed away the Moiety to Mr. <HI>Samuel Edolph,</HI> and he devised it by Will to Mr. <HI>Angell,</HI> who hath transferred his Right in it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Edward Chowte.</HI></P>
<P>The Farm called <HI>Godchepes</HI> or <HI>Goodchepes,</HI> in this Parish; for an unbroken Series of many Generations had Owners of that Sirname, as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of <HI>Thomas Godchepe,</HI> in the one and thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 47. and remained fastned to their Inheritance, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then by a strange and mysterious Fatality the Propriety of it was carried off, to <HI>Barrow.</HI> The Story is represented thus: <HI>John Bar∣row</HI> being an Atturney, was called to frame a Settlement by Deed of <HI>Thomas God∣chepe,</HI> and by his Direction was desired to insert eight Persons into the Deed, who were successively to inherit his Estate, and being asked by this <HI>John Barrow,</HI> whe∣ther he should adde the Names of any more, he was answered (because there had for∣merly been reciprocal Obligations of Friendship between them) that he should place his own next after those eight above mentioned. It pleased the eternal Arbiter of humane Affairs, so to order the vicissitude of things that those eight Persons recited in the Deed, deceased without Issue; so that his Estate here at <HI>Godchepe</HI> devolved to <HI>Barrow,</HI> as his Heir at Law, from whom by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his eldest Daugh∣ter and Co-heir, it came to Mr. <HI>Robert Edolph.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hoo</HI> gives Name to the Hundred wherein it is situated, and was a principal Branch of that Revenue, which fell under the Dominion of <HI>Bardolfe: Robert de Bardolfe</HI> held it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, as appears by the red Book kept in the Exchequer, in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second: and from him it came down to <HI>Hugh Bardolfe,</HI> who was rated for it after the same Account, in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the first; but <HI>Hugh</HI> Lord <HI>Bardolfe</HI> his Son, not long after concluded in three Daughters and Co-heirs. <HI>Mawde</HI> was matched to <HI>Nicholas Points, Margaret</HI> was married to <HI>Robert Aguillon,</HI> and <HI>Isolda</HI> was espoused to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Cod∣nor,</HI> which divided the Inheritance of that Family at this Place. But that Propor∣tion of it which was annexed by this Alliance to <HI>Points</HI> and <HI>Aguillon,</HI> was passed away by a Joint Sale to <HI>John de la Pole,</HI> and he paid respective supply for his Lands at <HI>Hoo,</HI> which were rated at half a Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; but before the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; this Family was worn out, and that Estate they held here was by Purchase involved and swallowed up in the Inheritance of <HI>Grey,</HI> who before was entituled to the Moiety of this Mannor, as descending from <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Codnor</HI> and <HI>Isolda</HI> his Wife, Co-heir to <HI>Hugh</HI> Lord <HI>Bardolfe,</HI> and in this Family did it continue until <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Codnor,</HI> in the twenty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, dy∣ing without Issue Male, left it to be Patrimony of Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which brought it to be the Inheritance of the Lord <HI>Zouch;</HI> but in this Family it had not long remained, when <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Zouch</HI> having pursued the Interest of the House of <HI>Yorke,</HI> did exemplifie his Zeal to it, by his being embarked in the Cause and Quarrel of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, in that signal and fatal Encounter at <HI>Bosworth</HI> Feild,
<PB N="188" REF="102"/>where the Title of the two Houses <HI>Yorke</HI> and <HI>Lancaster</HI> was put to the bloody Arbitration of the Sword; for which, after the Crown and Scepter by that happy Contest devolved to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, he was in the first year of that Prince's Rule attainted, and his Estate here granted to Sir <HI>Henry Wiatt,</HI> one of the Privy Coun∣cell to the said Monarch, whose infortunate Grand-child Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> being likewise attainted in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> it escheated, upon that Con∣fiscation, to the Crown, and there was lodged until King <HI>James,</HI> about the third year of his Raign granted it to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> whose Son <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> sold it <HI>quarto Caroli</HI> to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Knight and Baronet; from whom it is now come down to his Grand-child, Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Baronet, in whose Revenue, it, at this instant, is involved.</P>
<P><HI>Beluncle</HI> is another Seat in this Parish, whose Antiquity pleads for a Remem∣brance: the first Family whom I find in Record to have been possest of it was <HI>Foliot. Jordan de Foliot</HI> held it in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and <HI>Richard</HI> the first, by the fifth part of a Knights Fee; and from him did it descend to <HI>Richard de Foliot,</HI> his Son and Heir, who in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, passes it away by Fine to <HI>Reginald de Cobham,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> from the thirty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, to the fortieth of that Prince, and was accounted one of the principal Seats which was couched in the Demeasne of this Family; and, in divers old Pedigrees and other Deeds, they are written <HI>Cobham</HI> of <HI>Beluncle.</HI> Of this Fa∣mily was <HI>Henry de Cobham,</HI> who was summoned to Parliament as Baron, in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: <HI>Stephen de Cobham,</HI> who was summoned in the eighteenth year of that Prince: And <HI>Thomas de Cobham,</HI> who was summoned as Baron, in the thirty eighth year of that Prince. And in <HI>Cobham,</HI> and then <HI>Brook,</HI> did it continue, until <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> and his Brother <HI>George Brooke,</HI> in the first year of King <HI>James,</HI> being entangled in that cloudy Design of Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> which con∣tinues muffled up in a Mist until this Day, forfeited both their Estates, and the last his Life. But King <HI>James</HI> restored this to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> who dying with∣out Issue it devolved to Sir <HI>William Brooke</HI> Son of <HI>George Brooke,</HI> and he likewise deceasing without Issue-male, in the year 1643. it came over to Sir <HI>John Brooke,</HI> now Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> as Reversioner in Entail.</P>
<P><HI>Hollingbourne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was given to the Monks of <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for to supply them with Diet, by <HI>Athelstan</HI> Son of <HI>Ethelred,</HI> which Mannor he had before purchased of his Father; and in the year 909. with his Licence and Consent bestowed it on that Covent, free as <HI>Adisham.</HI> If you will discover how it was rated in the Conquerors Time, Doomesday Book thus repre∣sents it to you, <HI>Hollingbourne</HI> (saies that) <HI>est Mancrium Monachorum, &amp; de Cibo corum &amp; in Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro</HI> VI. <HI>Sullings, &amp; nunc similiter. Et est appretiatum inter totum hoc Maneriam</HI> XXX <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> This being thus fixed, remain∣ed from the Original Donation, locked up in the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, until the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was surrendred into that King's Hands by the Prior and Monks of the Covent aforesaid, and he that year ex∣changed it with <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>There was the Gallows which appertained to the Priory of <HI>Christ-church</HI> here erected at <HI>Hollingbourne,</HI> where those who had committed Murders, Felonies, or other Trespasses worthy of death, within the liberties of that Covent, were accor∣ding to their priviledge of <HI>Infangtheof</HI> and <HI>Outfangtheof,</HI> brought to exemplary pu∣nishment: See <HI>Somner Fol.</HI> 286.</P>
<P>There is a Mannor in this Parish called <HI>Ripple,</HI> which had Owners of that Name; for in the thirtieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 91. I find that <HI>Richard de Ripple</HI> held this, and other Lands, which he had in Lease from the Priory of <HI>Christ-church</HI> at his Decease, but it only gave him Sirname, and then left his Family; for before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it went from this Name to Sir <HI>William Septuans,</HI> and he enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and transmitted it to his Son <HI>William Septuans,</HI> who not long after conveyed it to <HI>John Gower,</HI> in which Name it lay couched until the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; and then it was alienated to <HI>Brockhull,</HI> a Cadet of that Stock which
<PB N="189" REF="102"/>flourished so long at <HI>Calehill,</HI> and here it continued for many Descents in this Fa∣mily, until the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> and then <HI>Henry Brockhull</HI> dying without Issue-male, <HI>Anne</HI> his only Daughter and Heir brought it to be the In∣heritance of Sir <HI>John Taylor,</HI> in which Family after it had lodged only until the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was passed away to Sir <HI>Martin Barnham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elnothington</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which had Owners likewise of that Sirname; for in a Deed of <HI>Adam de Twisdens,</HI> which bears Date from the one and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, one <HI>William de Elnothington</HI> is Witness: But af∣ter this man, I find no more mention in any Record of the Name: In the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I discover Sir <HI>Arnold St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Ulcombe</HI> to be possest of it, and in the forty second year he makes a Composition with divers of his Tenants for Lands that they held of this Mannor, and from him like an uninterrupted Thread, did the Title of this place passe thorough many Descents of this Family, until at last it devolved to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> who almost in our Memory alienated it to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pen-Court</HI> is another Seat in <HI>Hollingbourne</HI> worthy our Notice. It was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called <HI>Pen;</HI> but whether the <HI>Pens</HI> of <HI>Codcot</HI> in the County of <HI>Bedford,</HI> were descended from them or not, is uncertain; in Brief, before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was worn out, and then the <HI>Donets</HI> succeeded, but held this Seat not long: for by the Heir Generall it devol∣ved with much other Land to <HI>St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Ulcombe,</HI> and here it rested untill all∣most our Remembrance: and then it was passed away to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper;</HI> and he again conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Mark Questwood</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who, upon his Decease, settled it for ever on the Company of Fishmongers in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Muston</HI> is likewise within the Verge of this Parish: upon perusall of the an∣cient Deeds and Court-rols, I found it to be written <HI>Moston,</HI> as giving Name, in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, to a Family of that Appellation, which about the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, was wholly crumbled away, and had sur∣rendred the Possession to <HI>Wood,</HI> in which Family the Inheritance hath ever since been permanent.</P>
<P><HI>Greenway-court,</HI> is the last place considerable in this Parish; It was as high as the Conduct of any Evidence can guide me to discover, parcell of the Patrimony of <HI>At∣leeze,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Atleeze,</HI> dying without Issue, in the year 1394, gave it to his Brother <HI>Marcellus Atleeze,</HI> by whose Daughter and Coheir, it came to be possest by <HI>Valentine Barret</HI> of <HI>Pery-Court;</HI> and he, about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, conveyed it to <HI>Fitz Water,</HI> in which Family it remained, untill the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; and then it was alienated to <HI>St. Leger,</HI> with whose Inheritance it continued, untill almost our Age; and then it was by Sale trans∣planted into Sir <HI>Alexander Colepeper,</HI> who upon his Decease, gave it to Sir <HI>John Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Losenham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Langport</HI> and St. <HI>Martins,</HI> hath nothing memorable in it but <HI>Crawthorn,</HI> which for those worthy persons, who have successively held it, calls for some Memorial; for first, the <HI>Cheyneys</HI> were (as appears by ancient Evidences) Lords of the Fee: and when they went out, the <HI>Henleys</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, were the next eminent Possessors of it: and in the Descendants of this Family, did the propriety reside, untill the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Sterborough,</HI> who not long after conveyed it to <HI>Tooke,</HI> of <HI>Bere</HI> in <HI>Westcliffe,</HI> from whom it came over to Mr. <HI>Charles Took</HI> of <HI>Bere,</HI> and he hath lately, by the Vicissitude of Sale, transplanted his Con∣cernment in it, to his Nephew Mr. <HI>Edward Chowte,</HI> who being lately deceased with∣out Issue-male, hath setled it on his only Brother Mr. <HI>George Chowte.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Higham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> had anciently a Nunnery: but the original Chartularies, and other Records being lost, the Founder is unknown. King <HI>Hen.</HI> the third, by a Charter of Inspection, as appears <HI>Carta</HI> 11. <HI>parte secunda, Memb. septima,</HI> reviews the Liberties of this Cloister, and confirms them, and adds this Franchise or Immunity to the former, that this Parish lying couched in their
<PB N="190" REF="103"/>Demeasn, should hold a Fair on <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Day, and two days after. This Mannor, upon the Suppression, was by the Bounty of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth enstated for ever on St. <HI>Johns</HI> Colledge, in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and there at present it continues.</P>
<P>The places of most eminence, which were of secular Interest, are <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Okeley,</HI> which both were formerly united, though since dissever'd and pluck'd asunder by Sale. In the twentieth of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, I find them wrapt up in the Possessions of <HI>John de St. Clere,</HI> who held them by the fourth part of a Knights Fee, of the Honor of <HI>Montchensey,</HI> that is of <HI>Swanscamp-Castle,</HI> from whose Descendant, about the lat∣ter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, they were both passed away to <HI>Neile</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, conveyed <HI>Great Okeley</HI> to <HI>John Sydley</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to Sir <HI>Charles Sydley</HI> Baronet, the instant Inheritor of it. But little <HI>Okeley</HI> by the same Transmission was transferred to <HI>Colemeley</HI> or <HI>Cholmeley,</HI> who about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> resigned up his Interest by Sale to <HI>Thompson,</HI> from whom the ordinary Vicissitude of purchase not long since con∣ducted the Title down to <HI>Best.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Merston</HI> was formerly an independent Parish of it self, though since annexed to <HI>Higham,</HI> and had a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Giles,</HI> whose Ruines, in despight of the Impressions of Age, yet represent themselves to the smallest Glance of a curious Eye. It was, before it fell into this Darkness and Obscurity, made something il∣lustrious by being the Inheritance of <HI>John de St. Clere:</HI> and when this Family found its Tomb, the Name of <HI>Smith</HI> Stept in, and rose upon its Ruines. And when this was expired at this place, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, <HI>Jordan</HI> put in his Claim to the Possession of it; but about the latter end of the above∣said Prince, I find this Family extinguished, because the propriety of this Mannor was by one of the above mentioned Names conveyed to <HI>Anthony Tutsham,</HI> who not long after alienated the premises to <HI>George Brooke</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham;</HI> from whom, by des∣cendant Right, the Interest of it is devolved to Sir <HI>John Brooke,</HI> restored to the Barony of <HI>Cobham</HI> by the late King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> who now possesses this place as Reversioner in Entail to Sir <HI>William Brooke,</HI> who dyed without Issue-male in the year 1643.</P>
<P><HI>Horsmonden</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Brenchley, Horsmonden,</HI> and <HI>Larkefeild,</HI> was folded up in the Patrimony of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> a Family of a large Revenne, and as wide a Repute in this Track, from whom it descended to <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> by whose Inheritrix it was linked to the Patrimony of <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> from whom by the steps of divers Descents it went down to Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> who deceasing without any lawfull Issue, in the twelfth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: and there being not any that could by a pretence of collateral Alliance entitle themselves to his Estate, the Crown made it its own Interest by Escheat, and then the above said Prince, in the thirty sixth of his Raign, granted it to <HI>Richard Darell:</HI> and his Son <HI>George Da∣rill,</HI> in the tenth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Richard Paine,</HI> who not long after alienated it to <HI>Beswick,</HI> Ancestor to Mrs. <HI>Mary Beswick,</HI> who dying without Issue, hath settled it by Testament for life on Mr. ...... <HI>Haughton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Groveherst</HI> with its relative Appendages, <HI>Capell, Augustpits, Hoath,</HI> and <HI>Sneade,</HI> were lately passed away by Mr. <HI>Whetenhall</HI> of great <HI>Peckham</HI> to Mr. <HI>Francis Austin,</HI> whose Ancestor <HI>William Whetenhall</HI> Esquire, had them annexed to his Demeasne by match∣ing with <HI>Margaret</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>William Hextall,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, had purchased the four last places of <HI>Capell, Cheseman, Hoath,</HI> and <HI>Sneade,</HI> Families who had been entituled to the propriety of them many Descents before: But <HI>Groveherst</HI> was linked to the Demeasne of <HI>Kichard Hextall,</HI> Father of <HI>William</HI> above mentioned, by matching about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, with <HI>Anne</HI> one of the three Co-heirs of <HI>Richard Groveherst,</HI> whose Ancestors had been possest of it many hundred years before.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis Hoath</HI> was in Times of elder Track, the Demeasne of <HI>John de Groveherst,</HI> who lies buried in <HI>Horsmenden</HI> Church, and was a Priest in Orders, and dying so, be∣queathed this Mannor by Testament to the Abby of <HI>Begham,</HI> upon whose suppression, by the importunate Desire of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> it being found incorporated with the Demeasne of the above said Monastery, it became parcel of the Revenue of the
<PB N="191" REF="103"/>Crown, and remained there, until Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by Royal Concession passed it away to <HI>Anthony Brown</HI> Viscount <HI>Montague:</HI> but by a sudden Revolution, it was by Sale transmitted to <HI>Beswick,</HI> whose Heir Generall Mrs. <HI>Mary Beswick,</HI> hath late∣ly by Will, settled it on Mr. ....... <HI>Haughton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sprivers</HI> is likewise under the Repute of a Mannor; and had in elder Times, Owners of that Sirname: for I find that <HI>Rob. Spriver,</HI> dyed possest of it, in the year 1447, and by his Will, gives it to his Son <HI>Robert Spriver:</HI> and certainly from this Seat, the <HI>Sprivers</HI> which are scattered into some places of <HI>Kent,</HI> though now un∣der the Eclipse of an obscure Character, branched out originally. In Times of a more modern Aspect, the <HI>Vanes</HI> were the Proprietaries of it; and when this Name began to fade away, the <HI>Bathursts</HI> were the next successive Possessors, in whom the Title was not many years settled, but that by the same transitory De∣volution, it was put over to <HI>Malbert,</HI> from whom by as quick and as sudden a Mutation, it was incorporated into the Interest of <HI>Murgan.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Horton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Stowting,</HI> was a Mannor which belonged to that Pri∣ory, which was founded here by <HI>Robert de Vere,</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> Lord great Cham∣berlain of <HI>England,</HI> and dedicated to the Honour of St. <HI>John</HI> Baptist, it being a Cell to the Priory of <HI>Lewes,</HI> and stored with black Monks of the <HI>Cluniac</HI> Order. <HI>Adelina</HI> Daughter of <HI>Hugh de Montfort,</HI> was a principall Benefactresse to this House, and so were the <HI>Honywoods</HI> of <HI>Henewood</HI> in <HI>Saltwood</HI> not far distant.

<P><HI>Sherford, aliàs East-Horton,</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish; it was a Branch of that Demeasne, which fell under the Jurisdiction of <HI>Retling.</HI> Sir <HI>Richard de Retling</HI> was found in the enjoyment of it at his death, which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Horton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> was held by <HI>An.

In the first yeare of the Raign of King <HI>John, William de Rosse</HI> held a Knights Fee in <HI>Horton</HI> and <HI>Lullingston,</HI> and left it to his Sole Inheritrix, <HI>Lora de Rosse,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, brought it to be the Possession of her Husband ...... <HI>Kirkbie,</HI> who by this Match, being entituled to this place removed out of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where was his antient Mansion at <HI>Kirkbie Hall,</HI> and seated himself at <HI>Horton,</HI> where he re-edified the Castle, which as <HI>Darell</HI> relates, in his Tract <HI>de Castellis Cantii,</HI> did acknowledge the <HI>Rosses</HI> for its Founders, and built the Mannor House, upon which he engrafted his own Name, from whence it hath ever since acquired the Attribute of <HI>Horton-Kirkbie.</HI> But it was not long united to this Name; for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, this Family was extinguished in a Female Inheritrix, who was matched to <HI>Thomas Stoner</HI> of <HI>Stoner</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> Fa∣ther and Mother of Sir <HI>Thomas Stoner,</HI> who was Father to Sir <HI>William Stoner,</HI> who by <HI>Anne</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>John Nevill</HI> Marquesse <HI>Montacute,</HI> had Issue <HI>John Stoner,</HI> who died Issue-lesse, and had forfeited <HI>Horton</HI> Castle to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, by confederating with the Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> in his Insurrection against that Prince: and <HI>Anne</HI> a Daughter matched to Sir <HI>Adrian Fortescue,</HI> by whom he had the Mannor of <HI>Kirkbie Court,</HI> and by her only a Female Inheritrix, called <HI>Margery Fortescue,</HI> matched to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> Ancestor to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> of <HI>Nettlested,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> in the first year of King <HI>Charles;</HI> but <HI>Kirkbie</HI> was passed away by Sir <HI>Adrian Fortescue</HI> to Sir <HI>James Walsingham,</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, whose Grandchild, Sir <HI>Thomas Walsingham,</HI> about the latter end of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> alienated it to Alderman <HI>Hacket</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in whose Posterity the Propriety of it resides at this Day; but <HI>Horton</HI> Castle continued in the Crown, until King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted it to <HI>Robert Rudston</HI> Esquire; by the Heir General of which Family it is at this instant become the Inheritance of Mr. ...... <HI>Michell</HI> of <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Franks</HI> is an eminent Seat in this Parish, which was the Mansion of Gentlemen of that Sirname, who about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, came out of <HI>Yorke∣shire,</HI> and planted themselves at this place, and writ their Sirnames in very old Deeds, and other old Evidences <HI>Frankish,</HI> and bore for their Coat-Armour, as appears by Seals A Salteir engrailed ........ After <HI>Franke, John Martin,</HI> about the Beginning of of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth by purchase, became invested in the Possession, and he upon his Decease, which was in the year 1436. bequeathed it to a yonger Son, who bore his Name, and was called <HI>John Martin,</HI> from whom, by paternal Succession, it came down to his Grand-child <HI>Edward Martin,</HI> who about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> alienated it to <HI>Lancelot Bathurst,</HI> Alderman of <HI>London;</HI> who erected that elegant and magnificent Fabrick, which is now the possession of my noble Friend, his Grand-child, Sir <HI>Edward Bathurst.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reynolds</HI> is a third place of considerable importance; it was the Seat of Gentle∣men of that Denomination, and were rooted by a Prescription of so many years in the Possession of this Place, that it is a Controversie, whether those at <HI>Belso</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> or these here, were of the most venerable Antiquity; one of them in one
<PB N="193" REF="104"/>of his Deeds writes, <HI>Rogerus Filius Reginaldi.</HI> It is not bounded with any Date, and from this Orthography which was Customary in those Times, the Name of <HI>Rey∣nolds,</HI> or <HI>Fitz Reynolds,</HI> did by vulgar Acceptation and Use, first borrow its Original, But to advance in my Discourse. After this Seat had for sundry Descents been con∣stant to this Name and Family; it was, about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, transmitted by Sale to Sir <HI>John Browne,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1480. from whom it came down by paternal Descent to his Son and Heir, <HI>William Brown</HI> Esquire, who assigned it for subsistance to his second Son, <HI>John Browne</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the tenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and held his Shrieval∣ty at this place; and in this Name did the Title dwell, until not many years since it was dislodged, and by Sale transplanted into Sir <HI>John Jacob;</HI> from whom the like Fatality hath lately transported it, and cast it into the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Harbottle Grimston</HI> of <HI>Essex,</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Horton</HI> upon <HI>Stoure,</HI> near <HI>Canterbury,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Bridge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> and was involved in that spacious Inheritance, which acknowledged the Signiory of the Lord <HI>Badelesmere. Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmere,</HI> Steward of the Houshold to <HI>Edward</HI> the second, in the second year of that Prince, gave it in Franke-marriage with his Daughter <HI>Joane Badelesmere</HI> to <HI>John de Northwood;</HI> and that this was Custo∣mary in that Age, wherein the Times were dry for any pecuniary Supply, is most certain; for <HI>John de Northwood,</HI> this mans great Grand-child, in the eighth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, gave it in Franke-marriage with his Daughter to <HI>Christopher Shukborough</HI> of the County of <HI>Warwick</HI> Esquire, and he in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, alienated it to <HI>Gregory Ballard</HI> Esquire, whose Posterity for many years did successively possesse it, until <HI>Nicolas Ballard,</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> passed it away by Sale to <HI>Roger Trollop</HI> Esquire; and he in the second year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by Bargain and Sale demised his Interest in it to Sir <HI>Edward Warner,</HI> then Lievtenant of the Tower, and he in the sixteenth year of the Govern∣ment of that Princess, conveyed it to Sir <HI>Roger Manwood,</HI> Lord chief Baron of the Exchequer, whose Son Sir <HI>Peter Manwood,</HI> almost in our Fathers Memory, disposed of his Right in it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Christopher Tolderbye,</HI> who left it to his Son Mr. <HI>Christopher Tolderbye,</HI> and, he deceasing without Issue, <HI>Jane</HI> his only Sister and Heir, by matching with Sir <HI>Robert Darell</HI> of <HI>Cale-hill</HI> (a man eminent both by his Integrity and Hospitality, according to the accustomed Genius, which alwaies waited on this Family) brought it to be possest by that Name; upon whose Decease it devolved to his second Son Mr. <HI>Edward Darell,</HI> who is the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>There was an eager Contest between <HI>John Beckford</HI> Vicar of <HI>Chartham,</HI> and <HI>Christopher Shukborough</HI> Esquire, Lord of <HI>Horton,</HI> touching the celebration of Divine Offices in the Chappel at <HI>Horton;</HI> as likewise the Administration of the Sacraments: and it was improved to that Animosity, that there was a mutual Ap∣peal made to <HI>William Courtney,</HI> then Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who directed a Commission to <HI>John Barnett</HI> his Official, in the year 1380. to hear and determine the Controversie, and upon a serious sifting and winnowing this whole Affair, the Debate was wound up upon this Conclusion, that there should be a solemnization of all Divine Offices in the above mentioned Chappel, <HI>exceptis tantum D. functorum Sepulturis &amp; exsequiis,</HI> only the Dead were to receive their enterment in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chartham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hothfeild</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart, Longbridge,</HI> and <HI>Cale-hill,</HI> was wrapt up in the Demeasne of the Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> who held it in Grand Serjeanty of the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> that is, he was to serve up water to the Arch-bishop at his Installment or Inthronization to wash his Hands, and had <HI>Pelvim &amp; Lotorium;</HI> so are the Words of the Record: he was rewarded with the Vessel which contained the Water, and likewise the Towel which dried his Hands, and he was likewise to be his Chamberlin the Night of his Instalment, and was recompensed with the Arch-bishops Bed, as his Guerdon. <HI>Bartholomew de Badelesmere</HI> Son of <HI>Guncelin,</HI> died possest of it, in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

<PB N="194" REF="105"/>Association with the Rebellious Nobility, having in the sixteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, forfeited this to the Crown; it lay entwined with the Royal Revenue, until <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the second year of his Raign, restored it to his Son <HI>Bartholomew de Badelesmere,</HI> who in the twelfth year of that Prince's Government, dying without Issue, his four Sisters became his Co-heirs, whereof <HI>Margaret</HI> mar∣ried to the Lord <HI>William Rosse</HI> of <HI>Hamlake,</HI> cast this Mannor into the Inheritance of that Family, and he in her Right died seised of it, in the seventeenth year of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

And from him, did the Title by a lineal trans∣mission, passe down to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse,</HI> who vigorously endevouring to sup∣port the sinking Title of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> was by <HI>John Nevill</HI> Marquesse <HI>Montacute,</HI> discomfited in the North, and taken Prisoner, and after beheaded at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> upon whose Dysastrous Tragedy, this Mannor was laid hold on by the Crown, as an Escheat: and King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, in the fourth year of his Go∣vernment, granted it to Sir <HI>John Fogge</HI> of <HI>Repton</HI> for Life only, who was Trea∣surer of his Houshold, and one of his Privie-Councel; and whom King <HI>Richard</HI> the third, invited afterward out of the Abbey of <HI>West-minster,</HI> where he had taken Sanctuary for fear of some Mischief, intended him by that Usurper; and in the pre∣sence of a numerous Assembly, gave him his Hand, and bad him be confident, that he was thenceforth sure unto him in Affection. This I mention, the rather, because divers of our Chronicles, have erroneously mentioned, that he was an Attorney, whom this Prince pardoned for Forgery. But to proceed: After the Decease of Sir <HI>John Fogge,</HI> who dyed in the seventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted it to <HI>John Tufton</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to the right honorable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet,</HI> who now by paternal Right, claims the Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Swinfort</HI> is a Mannor in <HI>Hothfield,</HI> which afforded a Sirname to a Family so called: but whether Sir <HI>Otho Swinfort,</HI> Husband to <HI>Katharine Swinfort,</HI> who was af∣terwards Concubine to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> was extracted from this Family or not, is in∣certain; because I cannot discover they were ever of any Eminence. In <HI>Henry</HI> the fifths Reign, I find it in the Possession of <HI>Bridges,</HI> descended from <HI>John at Bregg,</HI> one of those eminent persons, that are depicted kneeling in Coat Armour, in a Window in <HI>Great Chart Church.</HI> And there is a place in that Parish, which still bears the Name of this Family, and is called <HI>Bridge,</HI> being divorced by no great distance from this Mannor: and in this Family did the Pro∣priety of this place continue, untill the latter end of King <HI>James;</HI> and then it passed away by Sale from <HI>Bridges,</HI> to Sir <HI>Nicholas Tufton</HI> Father to the right ho∣nourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet,</HI> the instant Owner of it.</P>
<P><HI>Faulesley,</HI> vulgarly now called <HI>Fausley</HI> and <HI>Fousley,</HI> was the Patrimony of a Fami∣ly, which borrowed not only its Source and Extraction, but its Denomination likewise from hence. Sir <HI>John Faulesley,</HI> was an eminent person, in the Raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, being frequently in his Time, as appears by the late printed Abridgement of the Records in the Tower, summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron: but although this Family was made eminent by this worthy person, who was an elder Branch of this Stem; yet in succeeding Generations it began to crum∣ble away, into Obscurity and Decay: and was at last ground to so narrow a pro∣portion of Estate, that about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> this Mannor, which had so long been espoused to the Interest of this Name and Family, was carried off by Sale to <HI>Drury;</HI> in which Family it was resident, untill the latter end of that Princesse, and then it was alienated to <HI>Paris;</HI> who immediately af∣ter conveyed it to <HI>Bull;</HI> and he transplanted his Right by Sale again into the same Family; from whom, a like Vicissitude brought it to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Nicholas Tufton,</HI> Father to the right honorable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> now Possessor of it.</P>
<P><HI>At Hothfield,</HI> in a field not far removed from <HI>Ripley,</HI> a Mannor belonging to <HI>Alexander Iden</HI> Esquire, was <HI>Jack Cade</HI> that Counterfeit <HI>Mortimer</HI> (who was mufled up, in that Name, by the House of <HI>York,</HI> only to fathom the depth of the peo∣ple's Affection to their Title, which was to take its Rise from that person) en∣countered, and in a single Combat, offered up to the Justice of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, by

Num.</HI> 10. <HI>Parte prima.</HI> But here the Possession likewise, before the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, was as volatile, and full of Vicissitude; for by the Female Inheritrix of this Family, it came to be the Demeasne of <HI>Heron:</HI> who, after he had some years owned the propriety of it, alienated the Fee-simple to <HI>Phineux,</HI> in which Name and Stem, when it had for many Descents, in a constant procedure, flourished; and had been productive of persons, of the highest Office and Trust, as they could be invested with, in Relation to the Service of this County, it was not many years since, passed away from this Family, and sold to Master <HI>Neview</HI> of <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Little Hougham,</HI> is a second Mannor in this Parish: It was, in Ages of a very high Ascent, the Revenue of the ancient Family of <HI>Basing. William de Basing,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 21. From whom it desceuded to his Grandchild <HI>John Basing,</HI> who dyed in the Tenure of it, in the seventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 6. Af∣ter whose Decease, it continued in the Name, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Clive,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Cliffe,</HI> a Family of eminent Account, in the Counties of <HI>Salop</HI> and <HI>Essex;</HI> and in the Possession of this Family it dwelt, untill the latter end of that Prince, and then by Purchase, it was made the Patrimony of <HI>Hextall,</HI> a Eamily who extracted their original, out of <HI>Staffordshire;</HI> and here it resided, untill the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then it was transmitted by a Daughter and Heir to <HI>Whetenhall;</HI> who sold it to <HI>John Bois</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to <HI>Jo. Bois</HI> of <HI>Fredville</HI> Esquire, who is entituled to the present Signiory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Maxton</HI> is a third place, which must not be waved in this Discourse: It was in elder Times divided between two Families called <HI>Madekin,</HI> and <HI>Walsham. Ste∣phen de Madekin,</HI> was not only Lord of <HI>Madekin</HI> in <HI>Denton,</HI> and the Moiety of this place, in the year one thousand seventy and seven, but likewise Land at <HI>Canterbu∣ry,</HI> as appears by Mr. <HI>Sompner,</HI> in his Survey of that City, page 415. And <HI>Will. de Walsham,</HI> who in the thirty seventh year, was possest of the other Moiety of this place gave, about that year by Charter, some land to the Incumbent or Parson of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Harbledown.</HI> After these two Families had deserted the Inheritance, I find the <HI>Archers,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to be entituled by Pur∣chase to it, and <HI>William le Archer</HI> (so he is written in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) paid an Auxiliary Supply for this Mannor, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at
<PB N="196" REF="106"/>making the Black Prince Knight; but his Son <HI>VVilliam Archer,</HI> in the twenty first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, passes away his Right by Sale to <HI>John Alkham</HI> of <HI>Alk∣ham,</HI> a Family that had taken deep Root in Antiquity downwards, and had a spreading Revenue upwards in this Track; but, before the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, were consumed and crumbled away, and then the next Family which succeeded in the Possession was <HI>Herman,</HI> who was likewise owner of <HI>Mary-place</HI> in <HI>Crayford,</HI> and in this Name did the Interest of it fix, until the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Andrews,</HI> who some few years after demised the Fee-simple to <HI>Pepper,</HI> and he almost in the Verge of our Remembrance sold it to Sir <HI>Thomas VVilford</HI> of <HI>Ilden,</HI> and he in our Memory alienated it to <HI>Richards</HI> of <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>Although the greatest part of this Mannor was of secular Concernment, yet I find that the Prior of St. <HI>Martins</HI> in <HI>Dover</HI> had some Interest in it, as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of <HI>John Atte-hall,</HI> where it is proved in the six∣teenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Numb.</HI> 129. <HI>Parte secunda,</HI> that he held Lands at his Death at <HI>Maxton</HI> of that Covent.</P>
<P><HI>Siberston</HI> is the last place of Account in <HI>Hougham;</HI> it gave Name in elder Times to a Family so styled; for in an old Deed without Date, in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Whit∣tingham-Wood</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> lately deceased, I find <HI>Richard de Siberston</HI> demises it to <HI>John Monins,</HI> and in another Deed I discover that <HI>John Monins</HI> Son of <HI>John Mo∣nins,</HI> passes the third Part of his Mannor of <HI>Siberston</HI> to <HI>John Monins</HI> the elder, in the thirty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. And this I think is Authority suffici∣ent to evidence to the Publique, that it was a parcel of that Estate that owned the Interest and Signory of that eminent Family, in which it lay couched until the lat∣ter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was by Sale transplanted into <HI>Pepper,</HI> whose Successor in our Fathers Remembrance conveyed it to <HI>Moulton</HI> of <HI>Retherhed,</HI> vulgar∣ly called <HI>Redriff</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> in whose Descendants the Inheritance of it does still continue.</P>
<P><HI>Hunton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Twiford,</HI> celebrates the Memory of an ancient Family, called <HI>Lenham,</HI> who were once Proprietaries of it. <HI>Nicolas de Lenham</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannour of <HI>Hunton,</HI> in the forty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third; but about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the Interest of it was departed from this Family, for <HI>William de Lenham</HI> determined in <HI>Eleanor de Lenham,</HI> his sole Inheritrix, and she by matching with <HI>John Gifford,</HI> wrapt up this and <HI>Ben∣sted,</HI> another little Mannor in this Parish, which likewise was parcel of <HI>Lenhams</HI> Estate, in the Demeasne of that Family; and he and his Wife paid Releif for <HI>Hunton</HI> and <HI>Bensted,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight. But after this, it was not long permanent in this Family; for about the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it was passed away with <HI>Bensted</HI> to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was found Heir to his Cozen <HI>William Clinton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington;</HI> for that Land which he held <HI>Jure proprio &amp; nativo,</HI> not <HI>Jure uxoris Julianae de Leybourne</HI> in this County. And the Effi∣gies of this <HI>John,</HI> and of his Grand child ...... Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> (who paid Relief, in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, for his Mannor of <HI>Hunton,</HI> at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> that Prince's Daughter) have escaped the furious Barbarity of these Times, and stand yet undemolished in the Church-Windows: and from this last did it descend to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> his Successor, who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh alienated the Fee-simple to Sir <HI>Henry Wiatt,</HI> one of the Privy Councel to the said Monarch, and his Son Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt</HI> the elder died seised of it, in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and transmitted it with <HI>Bensted,</HI> which his Grand-father likewise bought of the Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> to his infortunate Son Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> who adhering too strictly to an unhappy Clause in the Testament of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which obliges his Councel not to suffer his Daughters to espouse any Forrainer, involved him in that dysastrous Design, which could not be expiated, but by the Forfeiture of his Life and Estate, in which this Mannor of <HI>Hunton</HI> being concerned; it was in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> granted to her Atturney General, Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisinghurst,</HI> from whom the Title in the Stream of Succession, lately glided down to his Heir General Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, Son
<PB N="197" REF="106"/>and Heir to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, not many years since deceased.</P>
<P><HI>Burston</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Hunton,</HI> which is eminent for being the Seat of <HI>John de Burston,</HI> which the Dateless Deeds that relate to this Family, from the pro∣bable Conjecture of the Hand-writing, which is calculated for the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, record to have lived in that Prince's Time, and there was Land like∣wise about <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Crundall,</HI> that acknowledged the Jurisdiction of this Family; for in the forty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Waretius de Valoigns</HI> Knight, makes a Release of his Title to some Lands in those Parishes to <HI>John de Burston,</HI> and in this Family did this Seat remain for many Descents, and was productive of men of no despicable Account in this Track: amongst whom <HI>William Burston</HI> was returned, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, by <HI>Gervas Clifton</HI> then Sheriff, <HI>inter illos qui portabant Arma Antiqua.</HI> In the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, Alderman <HI>Head</HI> of <HI>London</HI> was resident here, and added much both of Building and Magnifi∣cence to this Fabrick; but certainly it was only as Lessee; for I cannot find that he was ever Proprietary of it, for about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was sold by <HI>Burston</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Vane,</HI> who upon his Decease gave it to his second Son ...... <HI>Vane,</HI> from whom it descended to his Heir Sir <HI>George Vane,</HI> whose Widdow Dowager the Lady ...... <HI>Vane</HI> is now in Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hunton</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to it by <HI>Nicolas de Lenham,</HI> on the Tuesday, and a yearly Fair to continue five Dayes, the Vigil, the Day of the Assumption of our Lady, and three Dayes after, <HI>Pat.</HI> 41. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 7.</P>
<P><HI>Hucking</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> is involved in the Mannor of <HI>Hollingbourne,</HI> and was enstated on the Prior and Convent of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> when that by a muni∣ficent Donation, augmented the Revenue of that Priory.</P>
<P>Yet there is an ancient Seat in this Parish, called <HI>Rumpsted,</HI> which never was couched in the Spiritual Patrimony; for it had anciently Owners of that Appella∣tion. Sir <HI>William de Rumpsted</HI> held this, and a Castellated Mansion in <HI>Sevenoke,</HI> of that Denomination, in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and he had Issue Sir <HI>John Rumpsted,</HI> possest of this place and <HI>Rumpsted</HI> in <HI>Sevenoke,</HI> and, as the Tradition asserts, educated Sir <HI>William Sevenoke,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> in the year of Grace 1418. In Ages of a nearer Descent to us, that is, in the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find <HI>Richard Peverell</HI> to have enjoyed it. And in Times subsequent to these, the <HI>Peckhams;</HI> but their Possession was very frail, for in the Raign of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> I find it to be in <HI>Figge,</HI> a Name of no despicable Character in this Parish; but it was very transitory here likewise; for about the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> the Title was interwoven with the Interest of <HI>Thompson,</HI> who in our Fathers Re∣membrance, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. ...... <HI>Taylor,</HI> Fruiterer to the above∣said Prince; and his Discendant, not many years since alienated it to Mr. <HI>Stringer</HI> of <HI>Goudherst.</HI></P>

<P><HI>ICkham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Downehamford,</HI> was given by King <HI>Offa</HI> to <HI>Christ-church,</HI> and to the Monks of that Covent, in the year 781. under the Notion of fifteen Plough-lands, and was for a Supplement of Dyet. This Donation in the year 958. was confirmed by <HI>Athelward, Odo</HI> the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> being then present, and attesting the Ratification: In the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, when the first Design of Doomesday Book was started; it was rated at four Sullings or Plough-lands: nor did it fall in that Account, when that generall Register was perfected, which was in the twentieth year of the Conqueror, defending it self at the same Estimate, and upon the Appraisment was valued at thirty pound. And here it was fastned until King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth finding the Revenue of the Church was diffused into too wide a Latitude and Circumference, contracted it by a general
<PB N="198" REF="107"/>Dissolution into a narrower Orbe, and having rent off this Mannor from the Eccle∣siastical Demeasne, like an Excrescence sprouting out from a luxuriant Stem, he ingrafted it again by his Letters Patent, on the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> and they settled it by Lease on <HI>Edward Isaack</HI> a Noble Confessor for the Protestant Religion, in the Raign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> when so many were sent to Heaven, like so many <HI>Elias's Flammeis vecti Quadrigis</HI> in Chariots of fire, who rather chose to desert his Country, then abandon his Religion, and to lose his Estate rather then to debauch or relinquish his Conscience, as his Epitaph on an old Tablet affixed to a Pillar contiguous to his Grave-stone in the Nave of <HI>Christ-church</HI> at <HI>Canterbury</HI> does instruct us. Upon his Recesse, this was seized upon by the Crown, and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> by Grant united it to the Revenue of <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> whose infortu∣nate Grand-child <HI>Henry Brooke,</HI> being attainted, in the Raign of King <HI>James,</HI> that Monarch restored his Estate, forfeited here, to <HI>Robert Cecill</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> his Brother in Law, whose Son <HI>Robert,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> holds the instant Possession of it, but hath lately alienated some part of it to Mr. <HI>Roger Lukin</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Apulton</HI> is a second Mannor in <HI>Ickham,</HI> written in old Deeds <HI>Apylton,</HI> as being the Inheritance of a Family of that Name; for in an old Deed of <HI>Reginald de Corne∣hill,</HI> that was owner of <HI>Lukedale</HI> in <HI>Littlebourne,</HI> not far distant, one <HI>William de Apylton</HI> of <HI>Ickham</HI> is a Witness; but whether this Family was knit by any Relation to the Noble Family of the <HI>Apyltons</HI> of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> I am incertain. Afterwards, the <HI>Denis's</HI> were possest of it, and one <HI>John Denis</HI> of <HI>Apulton</HI> in <HI>Ickham,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> in the year of Grace 1360. Founded here a Chauntry, in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by an old Manuscript, in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Thomas Denne,</HI> lately deceased, and was called <HI>Denis</HI> Chauntry, and the Lands which relate to it, are at this Day styled <HI>Denis</HI> Lands: After this Family was worn out, I find one <HI>Adam Oldmeade,</HI> by the private Deeds, to be in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, owner of it; from whom before the latter end of that Prince, it came over by Sale to <HI>Bemboe,</HI> and from him to <HI>Hunt,</HI> in which Family it made no long stay. For about the latter of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, I find it alienated to <HI>Dormer,</HI> a Branch of the <HI>Dormers</HI> of <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> and from this Name not many years after it went away to <HI>Gason,</HI> a Name very ancient in this Parish, and here like∣wise was the Possession of as brief a Date; for <HI>Dormer</HI> by Sale passed it away to <HI>Hodgekin</HI> (whose Ancestors were formerly possest of <HI>Uffington</HI> in <HI>Gonston,</HI> and trans∣mitted it by Sale to <HI>Ashenden</HI>) and here likewise was the Title very variable, for within the Circle of fourscore years it acknowledged not only this Family; but <HI>Rutland, Winter,</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> to have been its Successive Proprietaries: from the last of which, not many years since, it was by Sale carried off to <HI>Frostall,</HI> in which name it is still resident.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Baa</HI> in this Parish, had anciently Possessors of that Sirname, as appears by an old Fragment of Glass in the Church Windows, whereon is super∣scribed this incoherent Inscription. <HI>Hic ......

<P>Before I leave <HI>Ickham,</HI> I must inform the Reader that <HI>Peter de Ickham,</HI> was born in this Parish; a man whom both <HI>Ball</HI> in his Centuries, and <HI>Pitseus</HI> in his Track, <HI>de Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis,</HI> do highly magnifie for a man of eminent Literature: whither I refer my Reader.</P>
<P><HI>Ivie-church</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>St. Martins</HI> and <HI>Aloesbridge,</HI> contains sundry Places within its Confines, not to be entombed in silence. The first is <HI>Capells-Court,</HI> the Seat of a Family of that Sirname, and were written frequently <HI>At Capell,</HI> and in
<PB N="199" REF="107"/>Latin <HI>de Capella,</HI> and were a Family certainly of signall Account in <HI>Kent,</HI> as ap∣pears by their Land, which lay scattered in <HI>Linton</HI> and <HI>Boxley,</HI> where <HI>John de Ca∣pell</HI> held Land called <HI>Tattellmell</HI> in that Parish, in the thirty seventh year of <HI>H.</HI> the third, as appears by a Charter of Inspection, of that Prince, wherein he confirms Land to the Abby of <HI>Boxley,</HI> which bordered on the Land of <HI>John de Capell</HI> at <HI>Tattellmell. Richard de Capell</HI> this Man's Successor, dyed possest of <HI>Capell Court</HI> in <HI>Werehorn,</HI> and this here, in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second. But after this Man's decease, it did not long remain annexed to the Name: for this Family expiring in a Female Heir, shee by matching with <HI>Harlackenden,</HI> of the Borough of <HI>Harlackenden</HI> in <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> united it to the Patrimony of this Fa∣mily, and here it rested untill the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> and then <HI>Deborah,</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir of <HI>Walter Harlackenden,</HI> a Branch of the abovesaid Stem by espousing Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> late of <HI>Tunstall</HI> deceased, entwined it with his Demeasne: upon whose Death, it devolved to his Grandchild Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> now of <HI>Tunstall</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Cheyneys Court</HI> is a second place of Account in this Parish, and had this Name imposed upon it, because it lay folded up in the Revenue of that Name, of that Family, <HI>Alexander de Cheyney,</HI> who flourished in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in the ninth of which Prince's raign he was one of that Catalogue, as appears by <HI>Kirkbie</HI>'s Inquest kept in the Exchequer, who was em∣barked in that successefull War, which was commenced by that Monarch against the <HI>Welsh,</HI> and dyed possest of this Mannor, in the twenty fourth year of his Government. After whose Decease, it was constantly resident in this Family, untill <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney.</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Richard Knatchbull,</HI> whose Heir Generall, Sir <HI>Norton Knatchbull,</HI> Knight and Baronet, extracted originally, from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Knatchbulls</HI> of <HI>Limne,</HI> where I find the Name by Deeds, very ancient, is now in the Possession of the Demeasne, but the Mannor was conveyed by Sale to Sir <HI>Walter Roberts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>More Court</HI> is a third place in <HI>Ivie Church,</HI> which must not find its en∣terrement in Silence because it was the ancient Seat of the <HI>Moores,</HI> now Ba∣rons of <HI>Mellifont</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> before they were transplanted into <HI>More-place</HI> in <HI>Be∣nenden,</HI> by matching with the Heir generall of Sir <HI>William Brenchley,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, under <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and this is evident by a Fine levyed, between <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Thomas de Iden,</HI> and <HI>John de More</HI> of <HI>Ivie-church</HI> (so he is named in the Record) by which, the said <HI>John</HI> passes away Land to <HI>John de More</HI> of <HI>Rolvenden,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1280. And in this Family for many Generations was it constant and permanent, untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; and then the common Vicissitude of Purchase (which like a Moath or Canker, frets into ancient Titles) brought it to be the Possession of <HI>Taylor,</HI> and here it was settled untill in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, (as by an Ex∣emplification, now in the Hands of <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> Esq; is evident) it was divided between <HI>William</HI> and <HI>John Taylor</HI> Gentlemen; and they immediately after, by a joint and mutuall Concurrence, alienated their Interest here, to <HI>Peter Godfrey</HI> Gentleman, Great Grand-father to Sir <HI>Thomas Godfrey,</HI> now of <HI>Hepington</HI> in <HI>Ne∣ther Hardres,</HI> who is the instant Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Iwade</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> is a small Parish, situated no great distance from the <HI>Swale,</HI> which exposes it self to the injurious Impression of many Fogs, and other sullen Vapours, which exhale, from the adjacent Marishes; so that, the Air becomming by these Mists, contagious and unheathfull, we must expect, that it cannot be very populous, nor contain many places in it, considerable in their Account. The only place of Note being <HI>Colshill-hall,</HI> a place in its Name, pro∣portionate to its Position, though formerly it had Owners of its own Appella∣tion: for in a Deed of <HI>William de Codshill,</HI> who held Land at <HI>Middleton Bobbing,</HI> and elsewhere, and which bears Date, from about the fiftieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, I find one <HI>John de Colsted</HI> a Witnesse. But in Times of no great distance, from that Prince's Raign, I find the <HI>Alefs</HI> or <HI>Alephs,</HI> possest of it, and to this Fa∣mily:
<PB N="200" REF="108"/>does the ancient Shell or Fabrick of the House, owe the principal part of its Structure; especially that, which by its Antiquity obliges the Eye to so much Regard and Veneration as is evident by the Hall, which in diverse places is diaper'd with an A. and then a Leafe, a Rebus, which treasures up the Relique of the Name, remaining unwritten. And appears to be exceeding ancient, by the Character calculated for the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. From whose Time, un∣till the Beginning of the Raign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it continued knit to this Name of <HI>Alef;</HI> and then <HI>Thomas Aleph,</HI> the last of this Name, being extinguished in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Margaret,</HI> matched to <HI>John Monins</HI> Esquire, this by that Alliance, became the Inheritance of that Name, but made no long aboad in their Revenue: for in our Grand-fathers memory, it went away by Sale from <HI>Monins</HI> to <HI>Lewin;</HI> and <HI>Lewin,</HI> not many years since, concluding in a Female In∣heritrix, she by being affianced to <HI>Rogers,</HI> branched out from <HI>Rogers</HI> of <HI>Brianson</HI> in the West, linked it to the Inheritance of that Family, where it had as brief a Residence; for <HI>Rogers</HI> not long since, dying without Issue-male, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his only Heir, by her espousalls with <HI>Charles Cavendish,</HI> Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> hath now in∣terwoven it with the Propriety and Income, relating to that eminent and illustri∣ous Family.</P>

<P><HI>KEmsing</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Codsheath,</HI> is a Parish, which, in Respect of its Cir∣cuit and Dimension, is but despicable; but, in Relation to those Persons who in elder Times were Possessors of it, it is not inferiour in its value to scarce a∣ny Parish in this Hundred. The first that I find to be its Proprietary, was <HI>Falca∣tius de Brent,</HI> and he is mentioned in the Red-book kept in the Exchequer, to have held it in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and was Castellan likewise of <HI>Kemsing-Castle,</HI> a place then of important Concernment, though now it's Skel∣leton it self, be shrunk into such a desolate and neglected Masse of Rubbish, that it would be now as difficult to trace it out or find it, as it was formerly to conquer it. And this Mans Son, was that <HI>Falcatius de Brent,</HI> so famous in our Chro∣nicles for those wild Disorders and Sallies arising from those Boilings and Eva∣porations which were cast out by the Calentures of Youth, rather then from a∣ny vitious Habit, contracted from severall Acts of Excesse, and riveted into his Soul. Yet, it seems, these Excursions of his, did so disgust King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, that he made the Forfeiture of his Estate here, pay the price of his Vanities. In∣deed, that name, his Misfortunes rather then his Treasons, seem to Challenge. And then that Prince, in the sixth year of his Reign, granted it, with the Man∣nor of <HI>Sauters</HI> in <HI>Sutton at Hone,</HI> to <HI>Baldwin de Betun</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> in Right of his Wife <HI>Hawis,</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>William le Grosse</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Holdernesse.</HI> And this <HI>Baldwin,</HI> had, by her, two Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Hawis</HI> the eldest of them, was married to <HI>William le Marshall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> to whom her Father gave with her in Marriage, <HI>Kemsing Sawters,</HI> and much other Land in this County: but this Mans Successor, <HI>Anselme le Marshall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pem∣broke,</HI> dying without Issue, <HI>Robert Bigod</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> by <HI>Mawd</HI> his Mother, the Heir Generall of the Family, as being Sister to <HI>Gilbert Marshall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> entered upon the Estate of that Family, here at <HI>Kemsing:</HI> and he passed it away to <HI>Otho</HI> Lord <HI>Grandison,</HI> with the Advowson of the Church of <HI>Kemsing,</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. And after this Family was worn out, I find the <HI>Says</HI> to Step into the Inheritance, and <HI>Geffrey de Say,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<PB N="201" REF="108"/>one of them was affianced to Sir <HI>William Fiennes:</HI> who in her Right was invested in <HI>Kemsing,</HI> and from him was the Title by Descent transported over to <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Fiennes,</HI> Son of <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Fiennes,</HI> and he in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, passed it away to Sir <HI>Geffrey Bolein,</HI> Great Grand-father to <HI>George</HI> Viscount <HI>Rochford,</HI> who was beheaded and left no Issue, in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, so that this upon his Father Sir <HI>Thomas Boleyn,</HI> Earl of <HI>Wilts,</HI> departure with∣out any other Issue-male, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, devolved to that Prince, who seised upon it in Right of his Wife, the infortunate <HI>Anne Bullen,</HI> who was eldest Sister to the unhappy Viscount. And here in the Revenue of the Crown did it lie couched, until Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the first year of her Raign, passed it away by Grant to her Kinsman <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> Son of <HI>William Cary,</HI> Esquire of the Body to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and of <HI>Mary</HI> his Wife, Sister to Q. <HI>Anne,</HI> Mother to the above said Princesse, and his Grandchild <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Dover,</HI> alienated his Right in it to <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> and he not many years since, passed it away to Mr. ...... <HI>Smith,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Dog-Smith,</HI> who upon his Decease settled the Fee-simple for ever on the Hospital of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>South∣warke.</HI></P>
<P>There was an old Knightly Family, which tooke their Sirname from this Parish, and was styled <HI>Kemsing,</HI> and their Coat was <HI>Argent,</HI> a <HI>Fesse</HI> and <HI>Cheveron,</HI> interla∣ced <HI>Sables,</HI> now quatered by Mr. <HI>William Hart</HI> of <HI>Lullingston</HI> Esquire, in Right of <HI>Peche,</HI> who married the Heir General.</P>
<P><HI>Kenardington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackborn,</HI> is by Contraction called <HI>Kenarton:</HI> and al∣though it cannot much boast of the healthful situation thereof, yet it hath had Lords and Owners of a very great Estimate; <HI>Will. de Normannia</HI> held it in the Raign of K. <HI>John,</HI> and part of the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears by the Pipe Rolls, which relate to those Times, and concern this County:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rafe de Norman∣vill <HI>is re∣gistred in the list of those Ken∣tish Gen∣tlemen, who were with</HI> Rich∣ard <HI>the first at the Seige of</HI> Acon <HI>in</HI> Palestine.</NOTE> After him his Son <HI>Thomas de Normannia</HI> or <HI>Nor∣manvill;</HI> for so he is written in the ancient Rolls succeeded in the Possession of it, but died in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, without Issue-male; so that by his only Daughter and Heir it devolved to be the Possession of Sir <HI>William de Basing,</HI> with the Mannor of <HI>Cockride</HI> likewise, which was folded up in her Inheritance, and was one of those Knights who accompanied King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in the twenty eighth year of his Raign, in that succesful Expedition which he was ingaged in, when he undertook the Conquest of <HI>Scotland.</HI> After him, <HI>William de Basing</HI> held it, and was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; and dying in his Shrievalty, <HI>Margaret</HI> his Widdow accounted for the Profits of the County, as the Records of the Pipe Office set forth. Sir <HI>Thomas de Basing</HI> his Son died seised of it, in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and paid respective Aid for it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, and left it to <HI>John</HI> his Son, a Child of eight years of Age, who after was Knighted, and died possest of it in the seventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and left it to <HI>Thomas</HI> his Son and Heir, then eleven years of Age, and he had Issue <HI>Thomas</HI> likewise, who dying without Issue, <HI>John Basing</HI> his Uncle was found to be his Heir, but was scarce planted in his new acquired Patrimony: but he also, in the twenty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, expired without Issue, so that the Inheritance devolved to <HI>Alice</HI> his Sister matched to <HI>Thomas Mackworth,</HI> as the Heir General of the Family. And thus were the <HI>Basings</HI> at this Place extinguished, who before they planted in <HI>Kent,</HI> were registred amongst the prime Gentlemen of <HI>Middlesex: Salomon de Basing</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> the last year of King <HI>John; Adam de Basing</HI> was Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third; and <HI>Robert de Basing</HI> succeeded in that Office, in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and <HI>Basings-Hall</HI> ows both his Name and Foundation to this Family; and <HI>John Stow</HI> in his Survey of <HI>London,</HI> ascribes to them the Degree of Barons of the Realm. But to return into that Path from whence this Discourse had diverted me. After <HI>Mackworth,</HI> which, by Female Devolution, was possest of this Mannor, was worn out, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh: The <HI>Hornes</HI> of <HI>Hornes-place</HI> in this Parish, were by Purchase settled in the Inheritance. Gentlemen certainly they were of as eminent Account as any in this Territory, and had been Proprietaries of
<PB N="202" REF="109"/>this Seat for many Hundreds of years; for one <HI>Ralph de Hurne</HI> of <HI>Kenardington,</HI> was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae,</HI> in the Raign of King <HI>John,</HI> Persons, who, before the Office of Justice of Peace was instituted, did supply their Place, and were much in Resemblance, like the Grand Inquest at this Day, being assistant both by their presence and concurrent Counsels to the Justices in <HI>Eyre,</HI> in all the great De∣cisions which did relate to Causes Criminal, emergent <HI>à tribus Forisfacturis,</HI> or the three Forfeitures, Murder, Felony, and Breach of the Peace. But to proceed: In this Family, did the Propriety both of <HI>Hernes-place</HI> and <HI>Kenardington</HI> thus pur∣chased of <HI>Mackworth,</HI> lie rolled up together, until the twelfth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then <HI>Bennet Horne</HI> the Heir General of both these being matched to ...... <HI>Guldford</HI> a <HI>Romish Catholick,</HI> he, to decline the Oath of Supremacy, fled beyond Sea with his Wife, upon whose Recesse the Crown seised upon that Estate, which had formerly accrewed to him in behalf of his Wife at this place, as eschea∣ted upon the Statute of <HI>praemunire.</HI> And the above said Princesse immediately after, granted the Premises thus forfeited to <HI>Walter Moile</HI> of <HI>Buckwell</HI> Esquire, Ancest∣or to Mr. <HI>Robert Moile,</HI> who claims the present Signiory both of <HI>Kenardington</HI> and <HI>Hornes-place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kenington,</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> was a Mannor which alwaies related to the Crown, as is intimated by the Name, where lie tacitly couched some Hints of those who were Proprietaries of it. And <HI>Keningbrooke,</HI> which is circum∣scribed within the Limits of this Parish, was annexed by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror to his Royal Mannor of <HI>Wye,</HI> and was looked upon as an Appendage to it, and fol∣lowed the Fate of it at the common Dissolution, when the other was plucked away from the Patrimony of <HI>Battell Abby,</HI> in which ever since the Original Donation of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror it had been resident, and was with the Mannor of <HI>Wye,</HI> by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted, in the first year of her Raign, to her Kinsman <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon:</HI> and his Grand-child <HI>Hen.</HI> Earl of <HI>Dover,</HI> not many years since, passed it away by Sale to Sir <HI>Tho.

<P><HI>Bibrooke</HI> is a second Place in <HI>Kenington,</HI> which claims some Consideration. It was, as appears by very old Evidences, the Patrimony of a Family called <HI>Godwin,</HI> which flourished here in the Raign of King <HI>John, Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first; but after this it began to wither, and before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was altogether crumbled away, the last of whom that I find by publique Record to be invested in the Possession, was <HI>William Godwin,</HI> who enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the thirty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 93. The next Family after this, which was entituled to the Possession, was <HI>Belknap;</HI> but Sir <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> being infortunately attainted and banished, in the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, to whose Cause and Quarrel he had wholly vowed his Life and Service, and his Estate, as to the principall part, confiscated, in which this lay in∣volved, the same Monarch, in the thirteenth year of his Raign, granted it to <HI>William Ellys,</HI> who was at that Time one of the Conservators or Justices of the Peace of this County, whose Capital Seat was at <HI>Burton</HI> in this Parish, though in very old Deeds it is written <HI>Burston,</HI> as being indeed the Seat of a Branch of that Family, from whom it came over about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, to <HI>Ellys,</HI> but in the Name of <HI>Ellys</HI> the Title of <HI>Bibrooke</HI> was not long-liv'd; for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find it by Purchase invested in <HI>Shelley,</HI> by whose Heir General it devolved in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, to <HI>May,</HI> from whom not long after it was alienated to <HI>Tilden,</HI> where it continued, until about the Be∣ginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then the same Revolution transported the Title to <HI>Best,</HI> who about the latter end of that Princesse, passed it away by Sale to <HI>Hall,</HI> Ancestor to Mr. <HI>Nevill Hall,</HI> the present Lord of this Mansion; but <HI>Burton</HI> was more constant to the Family of <HI>Ellys,</HI> and remained linked to the Patrimony of that Name, until that Age, which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was demised by Sale to <HI>Hall,</HI> in whose Descendant Mr. <HI>Nevill Hall,</HI> the Propriety is at present resident.</P>

<P><HI>Keston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> belonged (in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, as the Pages of <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book inform me) to <HI>Gilbert de Mag∣ninot,</HI> and there it is written <HI>Cheston:</HI> and continued in his Name, untill the lat∣ter end of King <HI>John;</HI> and then by the Heir Generall of this Family, it came to be possest of <HI>Say,</HI> of <HI>Says-court</HI> in <HI>Deptford:</HI> but stayed not long in this Name, for in the twenty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Alexander de Cheyney</HI> dyed pos∣sest of it, as appears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 26. But in his Posterity likewise, it had no long Residence; for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it was con∣veyed to <HI>Stephen de Ashway;</HI> and he in the thirty eighth of this Prince, ob∣tained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Keston.</HI> And here the Title fix∣ed, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was alienated with <HI>Baston,</HI> which had still the same original and successive Proprietaries with <HI>Keston,</HI> to <HI>Squerris</HI> of <HI>Squerries-court</HI> in <HI>Westerham:</HI> and here it made its aboad untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it devolved by <HI>Dorothy</HI> Daughter and Co∣heir of <HI>Thomas Squerrie,</HI> to <HI>Richard Mervin</HI> of <HI>Fountell</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> who passed a∣way <HI>Keston</HI> and <HI>Baston,</HI> both which accrued to him, upon the Division of <HI>Squerrie's</HI> Estate, to <HI>Philp Reynolds,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Tregarthen,</HI> as his Trustees; and they, in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, convey them both to <HI>Richard Scroope</HI> and <HI>Ste∣phen Scroop;</HI> from whom about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, they came to <HI>Henry Heyden</HI> Esquire; and he in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the first, as is manifest, by an old Court-rol, held a Court here at <HI>Keston;</HI> and from him, did the Propriety, by the Steps of several Descents, come down to that worthy Person Sir <HI>Christopher Heydon;</HI> who about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> demised all his Interest in <HI>Keston</HI> and <HI>Ba∣ston,</HI> to Sir <HI>Samuel Lennard,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Stephen Lennard,</HI> is still entituled to the Fee-simple of them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> conjectures in his <HI>Britannia,</HI> something of the Name of <HI>Caesar,</HI> to be couched in the Etymologie of this place, because at <HI>Baston,</HI> adjoyning, there is an ancient Camp, stupendious for the heighth of double Rampiers, and depth of double Ditches, hardly paralleled elsewhere, and questionlesse the work of ma∣ny Labouring Hands. Of what Capacity it was, is not now exactly to be discer∣ned, much of it being overgrown with a Thicket: but very vast it was, as may be collected, from its remains, which are yet apparent. And most probable, it is that Camp which <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> pitched, when the Britons, with their united strength, gave him the last Battle; and then the successe, being not equall to their Cou∣rage, retired, and gave him way to pierce into <HI>Surrey,</HI> and so towards the <HI>Thames</HI> by <HI>Noviomagum,</HI> or <HI>Woodcott,</HI> where he planted a spatious City and standing Camp.</P>
<P><HI>Kingsdown</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wrotham,</HI> is spread into two Mannors called <HI>North∣court,</HI> and <HI>Southcourt,</HI> both which anciently acknowledged themselves, to be par∣cell of the Demeasne of <HI>Fitz Bernard,</HI> who flourished here, under the Notion, and in the Degree of Barons, and had this Mannor by Grant from <HI>Henry</HI> the first, and with it, had these priviledges, annexed to it, <HI>Toll</HI> and <HI>Theam, Sac</HI> and <HI>Soc, Furcas in Latrones Captos,</HI> that is, <HI>Infangthef</HI> and <HI>Outfangthef, Tumbrell</HI> and <HI>Pillory,</HI> and lastly, <HI>Assisam Panis &amp; Cerevisiae,</HI> that is, a power to take Cognizance, of the Weights, and Measures of Bread, and that Beverage, which was then in use, within the Precincts of this Mannor; and all these were allowed to <HI>Ralph Fitz Bernard,</HI> as granted before by <HI>Henry</HI> the first, by the Judges <HI>Itinerant,</HI> in the se∣venth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and this Man was Son to <HI>John Fitz Bernard,</HI> who was rated, after the value, of a whole Knights Fee, for his Mannor of <HI>Kings∣down</HI> (as appears by <HI>Testa de Nevill</HI>) in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the Marriage of <HI>Isabell,</HI> that Prince's Sister. <HI>Thomas Fitz Bernard,</HI> Son to <HI>Ralph</HI> above-mentioned, enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

And from him, it descended to <HI>John Fitz Bernard,</HI> who in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, dyed without Issue, upon whose Decease, the four Daughters, of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> matched to <HI>Rosse, Vere, Mortimer,</HI> and <HI>Tiptoft,</HI> entered upon the Possession, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heirs to their Mother, who was Sister and Heir, to this <HI>John Fitz Bernard,</HI> and

And from him, did it glide down to his infortunate Grandchild <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse,</HI> who was attainted and beheaded at New-Castle in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, whilst he endevoured to support the sinking House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> upon whose Shipwrack, this was annexed to the Revenue of the Crown, and in the eighteenth year of his Reign, <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, restores it for Life, to <HI>Margaret,</HI> Wife of <HI>Roger</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who was Widow of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse:</HI> but after his Deeease, it returned to the Crown, and slept in its Revenue, untill King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passed it away by Grant, to <HI>John Wilkinson;</HI> from which Name, about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was conveyed to <HI>Richard Lovelace,</HI> who dying without Issue-male, <HI>Margaret</HI> matched to <HI>Henry Cooke</HI> of <HI>Lanham</HI> Esq;, became his Heir, and in her Right, is now entered upon <HI>Northcourt</HI> and <HI>Southcourt,</HI> which make up the Mannor of <HI>Kingsdown.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hever</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Kingsdown,</HI> which was parcell of the Demeasne of the ancient Family of <HI>Hever,</HI> of <HI>Hever Castle</HI> in this County. <HI>William de Hever,</HI> had a Charter of Free-warren, to his Lands here, and at <HI>He∣ver,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, which was renued to <HI>Thomas de Hever,</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but he did not long enjoy it: for he dying without Issue, <HI>Joan</HI> his Sister and Coheir, matched to <HI>Reginald</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> be∣came Heir to his Estate at this place, and he in her Right, dyed possest of it, in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. But before the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, this Family was worn out, and then the Family of <HI>Ʋrban</HI> succeeded by purchase in the Possession. <HI>John Ʋrban</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Rot.

But it was not long, after this, in the Tenure of this Name: for <HI>Richard Lovelace,</HI> by his last Will, in the year 1465, which was made in the fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, ordains, that his Feoffees make an Estate of this Mannor of <HI>Hever,</HI> which he purchased of <HI>Penhale,</HI> to <HI>Katharine,</HI> his Daughter; and if she dye without Issue, as she did, then he wills, that it descend to <HI>John Lovelace</HI> his Son and Heir: and from this <HI>John</HI> did it, by an uninterrupted Series of Descent devolve to <HI>Rich. Lovelace;</HI> and from him, did it go away by <HI>Margaret</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir to <HI>Henry Cook</HI> of <HI>Lanham</HI> in <HI>Suffolk</HI> Esquire, in which Name it is at this instant resident.</P>
<P><HI>Chipsted</HI> is a third Mannor in <HI>Kingsdown,</HI> which indisputably gave Seat and Sir∣name to a Family so called. For I find, <HI>Adam de Chipsted</HI> dyed possest of it at his Death, which was in the forty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 16. And after this Family was extinguished, the <HI>Mowbrays</HI> were planted in the Possession, and continued in the Inheritance, from the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; and then it was passed away by Sale, to <HI>John Martin,</HI> Justice of the Common-pleas, whose Son <HI>John Martin</HI> in the thirty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, alienates it to <HI>Thomas Underdown</HI> of <HI>Dert∣ford;</HI> and he, not long after, gives it to <HI>Richard Thetcher,</HI> of <HI>Warbulton</HI> in <HI>Sussex;</HI> and he in the nineteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, sold it to <HI>William Atwood;</HI> and his Son <HI>Robert Atwood,</HI> in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, demises one moiety of it to <HI>Nicholas Taylor,</HI> and the other Moiety, in the twenty second year of the abovesaid Prince, to <HI>Sibill</HI> of <HI>Littlemoat</HI> in <HI>Eynsford. William Taylor,</HI> and <HI>William Atwood,</HI> in the first year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> passe away their Propor∣tion of it to Sir <HI>John Champneys,</HI> and his Son <HI>Justinian Champneys,</HI> not long after alienates his Interest in it to <HI>Lovelace,</HI> and by the Heir Generall of that Fami∣ly, it is now devolved to Mr. <HI>Henry Cook</HI> abovementioned: the other Moiety by <HI>Ann</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>Lancelot Sibill,</HI> came to be possest by Mr. <HI>John Hope:</HI> in which Name it did not long remain; for in our Memory, it was by Sale, demised to Mr. <HI>Hodsoll,</HI> of <HI>Hodsoll</HI> in <HI>Ash,</HI> and he is now in the enjoyment of it.</P>

<P><HI>Woodland</HI> is the last Mannor in this Parish, and was anciently a Chappell of Ease to <HI>Kingsdowne,</HI> till in the year 1557. it was by <HI>Reginald Fole</HI> then Cardinal and Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> united to <HI>Wrotham.</HI> But the Mannor is still circumscribed within the Precincts of <HI>Kingsdown.</HI> It was formerly a Branch of that Revenue which owned the Title and Jurisdiction of that powerful Baron, <HI>Hamon de Creve∣quer,</HI> and he died possest of it, in the forty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

But, after him, I find not much more of this Family at this Place; for in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John,</HI> Son of <HI>John St. Clere</HI> enjoyed it, as appears by the Inquisition taken after his Death, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Kingsdown</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> was given by <HI>Hubert de Burgh,</HI> to his new∣ly erected <HI>Maison le Dieu</HI> in <HI>Dover,</HI> which was to be a Retreat for the Knights Tem∣plers, when they visired <HI>Temple Ewell,</HI> and other Lands they enjoyed in this Track; but this Mannor, upon the total Suppression and Abolition here in <HI>England,</HI> was in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, united to the Revenne of the Knights Hospitalers, and remained annexed to their Demeasne, until the common Disso∣lution supplanted it, and then King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> who in the first year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by Sale conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Tho∣mas Finch,</HI> from whom it is now by Descent come down to be the Inheritance of his Successor Mr. <HI>Thomas Finch.</HI></P>

<PB N="206" REF="111"/>wedded to <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse</HI> of <HI>Hamlake,</HI> and <HI>Margerie</HI> matched to <HI>John Tiptoft;</HI> but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family had wholly departed from this place, and the entire Possession was surrendered up to <HI>Rosse.</HI> For <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse,</HI> dyed possest of it, in the seventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

And from him, did the Title slide down to his unhappy Successor <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse,</HI> who was attainted in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and his Forfeiture brought it to the Crown, where it rested, untill the above∣said Prince, granted it to <HI>Roger</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth.</HI> And <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wife, Widow of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse,</HI> in the eighteenth year of his Rule, he conveyed it to him, be∣cause he had been a great Supporter of his Partie and Title, and then to her, because she was Sister to <HI>John Tiptoft</HI> Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> who was offered up, as an Oblation by the Lancastrian Faction, to his Cause and Quarrell; and from this <HI>Roger,</HI> did it come down to his Successor <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who in the twenty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, demised it by Sale to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> Esquire, in which Family it continued, untill the thirty fourth year of that Prince: and then it was conveyed away to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher</HI> of <HI>Bourne</HI> Baronet, not many years since, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Gibbons</HI> of <HI>Westcliff,</HI> who settled it in Marriage, upon his second Son Dr. <HI>Gibbons,</HI> not long since deceased, in whose Descendants, the Propriety is still resident.</P>
<P><HI>Ilding</HI> in <HI>Kingston,</HI> in Times of as high a Step as any Records can ascend to, was the <HI>Garwintons</HI> of <HI>Bekesbourn,</HI> as appears by that Signal Controversie, com∣menced between <HI>Thomas de Garwintor,</HI> and <HI>Theobald de Twitham,</HI> touching some lands couched within the Verge of his Mannor of <HI>Ilding:</HI> and the Question was so knotty and perplexed, that <HI>Henry de Cobham, Geffrey de Say, Hugh de St. Leger, Ralph de St. Leger, Gile; de Badelesmere, Fulk de Peyferer, Robert de Malevill, Alex∣ander de Rosse, Robert de Gatton, Robert de Campania, Richard de Bere, Henry de Sorne, Henry de Enbroke, Alured de Corton;</HI> and other Gentlemen of prime Account in this Track, were chosen <HI>Recegnitores magnae Assisae,</HI> in the second year of King <HI>John,</HI> by their Prudence and dextrous Conduct, to soften and becalme this Diffe∣rence. But to go on: after the Signory of this place, had for many Ages, been constant to this Family, it devolved to <HI>Thomas Garwinton,</HI> who dying without Issue, in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Richard Haut</HI> who had married <HI>Joan Garwinton,</HI> his Heir Generall in her Right was entituled to the Possession of this place; but his Son and Heir <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> was the last which held it: for <HI>Margery</HI> his Sole Inheritrix, united it to the Inheritance of <HI>Isaack,</HI> in which Name it stayed, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was transmitted by Sale to <HI>Diggs</HI> of <HI>Diggs-court</HI> in <HI>Berham,</HI> and remained clasped up in their Reve∣nue, untill that Age, which almost was concluded in the Circle of our Remem∣brance, and then it was by Sale transplanted into <HI>Wilford,</HI> so that the Lady <HI>Eliz. Wilford,</HI> Widow Dowager of Sir <HI>Thomas Wilford,</HI> is now by Right of Jointure in Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Parmested</HI> is a third place which calls for a Survey: it was as high, as any Evidence drawn from Record will instruct me to discover, the Inheritance of a Family which bore that Sirname: for in diverse old Deeds which I have surveyed, I find one <HI>Hugh de Permested</HI> to be a Witnesse, which is very probable, was Lord of this Place. But before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, this Fami∣ly was worn out, and that of <HI>Garwinton</HI> planted in the Possession, as appears by an old Fine levyed in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, by <HI>Hugh Garwinton</HI> in which he passes away his Estate at <HI>Permested,</HI> to <HI>Thomas Garwinton:</HI> from whom it descended to his great Grandchild <HI>William Garwinton,</HI> who dyed possest of it, in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot.

But left no Issue, so that <HI>Joan</HI> his Kinswoman, matched to <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> became his Heir; and he had Issue <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> in whom the Male-line concluding, <HI>William Isaac,</HI> in Right of his Wife <HI>Margerie,</HI> who was Daughter and Heir to the above-mentio∣ned <HI>Richard,</HI> entered upon his Estate here at <HI>Permested;</HI> and about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passed it away by Sale to <HI>Edward Knevet,</HI> of <HI>Newington Bel∣house</HI> Esquire, and his Daughters and Coheirs, by joint Sale, demised it to <HI>Tho.</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="111"/>Lord <HI>Cromwell:</HI> and he in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, alienated it to <HI>Christopher Hales</HI> Esquire, afterwards knighted, first Attorney Generall, and then Master of the Rolls, under the abovesaid Prince, and his Son Sir <HI>James Hales,</HI> conveyed it away to <HI>Thomas Alphew aliàs Alphy, Yeoman.</HI> From this Man it came over by Sale in the fifth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>William Downe</HI> of <HI>Maidstone</HI> Draper, and he in the sixth year of that Princesse, transmitted it by the like con∣veyance to Doctour <HI>Vincent Denne,</HI> Doctour of the Civil Law, Grand-father to Mr. <HI>Vincent Denne</HI> of <HI>Grays Inne</HI> Esquire, the present Lord of the Fee. A Person to whose Conduct and supply this particular Survey ows a grateful Remembrance, be∣cause, by his Concurrent Aid, it was guided along through all those Difficulties which might have probably intercepted it in its farther progresse.</P>
<P><HI>Denhill</HI> in this Parish was not only the Seat, but likewise the Seminary of a Fa∣mily of eminent Note in this County; <HI>Ralph de Den</HI> held much Land in <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> and likewise at <HI>Buckhurst</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> (as appears by an old Roll now in the Hands of the Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI>) about the twentieth of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, and is styled in the Record, Son of <HI>Robert Pincerna,</HI> a Name imposed upon his Father from being, as is probable, either Butler or Sewer to <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, an Office of no vulgar Account in those Times. Sir <HI>Alured de Den</HI> flourished in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and was a Person of signal Estimate in that Age; for when the Laws of <HI>Romney Mersh</HI> were compiled by that venerable Judge, <HI>Henry de Bath,</HI> from which all <HI>England</HI> receives Directions for Sewers, this Sir <HI>Alured</HI> and <HI>Nicolas de Haudloe</HI> were his Associates and Assistants in the Composure of them, in the forty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, on Saturday next after the Nativity of St. <HI>Mary;</HI> and which makes this Sir <HI>Alured de Den</HI> more remarkable, he sealed even in that Age, divided by so remote a Distance from us, with three <HI>Leopards Heads</HI> couped and full faced, which is the ancient paternal Coat of this Family. Indeed if I should enter into a particular Discourse of all those Persons who have been originally extracted from this Family, and were formerly eminent, not only within the private Sphere of this County, as being invested with the Commission of Justi∣ces of the Peace, and other Offices of publique Trust and Concernment, but like∣wise shone like Stars of the first Magnitude, within the two Orbes of Divinity, and the Law both Civil and Municipal; the Survey of this Place, which I intend to retrench within as narrow Bounds as may be, must swell into a particular Treatise; it is enough therefore to inform the Reader, that it hath been so many Centuries of years folded up in the Propriety of <HI>Den.</HI> that there is no <HI>Gappe</HI> at all in the Succession between <HI>Ralph de Den</HI> the first of that Name, and <HI>Tho. Den</HI> Esq; the last who in a direct Line enjoyed it. Nor hath it yet departed from the Name; for the above mentioned <HI>Thomas,</HI> lately deceasing without Issue-Male, <HI>Vincent Donne</HI> of <HI>Grays-Inn</HI> Esquire, collarerally issued out of this Family, by matching with <HI>Mary</HI> his yongest Daughter and Coheir in Right of this Alliance, is now in the instant Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Kingsnoth</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> did in elder Times give Sear and Sirname to a Family which assumed its Denomination from hence, who bore as appears by Seals appendant to their ancient Deeds, <HI>Ermin</HI> upon a <HI>Bend,</HI> five <HI>Che∣verons,</HI> and <HI>John de Kingsnoth,</HI> who flourished here about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, sealed with that Coat, and this Inscription encircles the Seal, <HI>Sigillum Joannis de Kingsnoth.</HI> Yet I find <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> who was attainted, in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the second, had some Interest in this Mannor, which upon his Conviction escheated to the Crown, and rested there, until <HI>Richard</HI> the second, granted it out again to Sir <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> the Judge, who had not long before purchased that proportion which <HI>Kingsnoth</HI> was concerned in: So that by this Con∣cession it came entirely to own the Signory of this Family. But he being infortu∣nately attainted, and cast into Exile, in the tenth year of the above said Prince; this Mannor was annexed to the Revenue of the Crown, and was lodged there until <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the twenty seventh year of his Raign, granted some part of it to Sir <HI>Thomas Brown,</HI> of <HI>Bechworth Castle</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and with it a Charter to inclose a Parke, which had Liberty of Free-warren annexed to it; and likewise, the more to endear him, licensed this Town to hold a Fair yearly on <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Day, but
<PB N="208" REF="112"/>the principal part of it was conveyed by Sale to Cardinal <HI>Kemp,</HI> who about the twenty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth settled it on the <HI>Colledge</HI> of <HI>Wye,</HI> where it remained until the Resignation of its Revenue into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Raign, and he by Royal Concession made it the Demeasne of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Essex.</HI> Who being attainted of High Treason, in the thirty second year of that Prince, it escheated back to the Crown, and then a Moiety of it, in the thirty fifth year of his Government, was granted to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> from whom by hereditary Conveyance it was delegated and transmitted to his Successor Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisingherst</HI> Baronet, who some few years since hath alienated his Concerment here, to Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Powell</HI> of <HI>Ewherst</HI> in <HI>Sussex.</HI> The other Moiety of it lay folded up in the Patrimony of the Crown, un∣till the first year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was by that Princesse granted to her Kinsman <HI>Henry Cary,</HI> afterwards created Baron <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> from whom by the Channel of Descent, it was transported to his Grand-child, the Right Honorable <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Earl of <HI>Dover,</HI> who in our Memory conveyed it to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> Father to the instant Proprietary, the Right Ho∣norable <HI>Heneage Finch,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Winchelsey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Munfidde</HI> in this Parish was originally the Seat of the <HI>Clere's,</HI> written in their ancient Deeds <HI>le Clere.</HI> But as all Families have their Vicissitudes and Tombs; and, like the Sea, which is circumscribed and shut in with a Girdle of Sand, are fettered to a determinate Period, so was this: for about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Henry le Clerc</HI> concluded in <HI>Susan le Clerc;</HI> who was his Daughter and Heir, and she by matching with Sir <HI>Simon Woodchurch,</HI> annexed this Mannor to his Patrimony; and he the better to inforce and perpetuate the Memory of this Alliance, and the Estate, which devolved to him by so fortunate a Conjunction; inverted his Sirname, and writ it for the future <HI>Clerc alias Woodchurch;</HI> in which Name the Propriety of this Place continued until the latter end of Q. <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Taylor</HI> of <HI>Shadoxherst,</HI> in which Name, the Interest of it, had not long continued; but that it was in our Remembrance by Sale conveyed to <HI>Whitwick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>West-Halks</HI> is a third Mannor in <HI>Kingsnoth,</HI> which in elder Times was ennobled, for affording a Residence to a Family of this Sirname; who bore in ancient Seals a <HI>Fesse</HI> between three <HI>Hawks,</HI> or <HI>Falcons,</HI> and sometimes one: a Family of no contemptible Estimate, or shallow Antiquity in this Track, as appears by old Escripts, Pedigrees, and other venerable Muniments, which represent this Family under the Character of Gentlemen, for above three hundred years. <HI>Sampson de Halk</HI> died about the year 1360, and held not onely this place,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ex Auto∣graphis pe∣nes Dom.</HI> Tho. Tay∣lor.</NOTE> but much other Land about <HI>Petham,</HI> and other Parishes in that Track; but about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, this Family had demised the Propriety of this place to <HI>Taylor</HI> of great <HI>Chart,</HI> in which Name it was constantly fixed, untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seaventh, and then it was sold to <HI>Clerc,</HI> who about the latter end of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away to <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> of <HI>Charing</HI> Esquire; who, upon his Decease, settled it by his last Will on his second Son by his second Wife, Col. ....... <HI>Honywood</HI> now the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Knowlton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastrye,</HI> was parcel of the Patrimony of the noble Family of <HI>St. Leger.

<P><HI>LAmberherst</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Little Bernefield,</HI> and was sometimes writ∣ten <HI>Lamberts-hurst,</HI> from <HI>Lambert</HI> a <HI>Saxon</HI> Owner; in old English, this Name imports as much as bright, or holy and glorious Lamp, as <HI>Herebert</HI> is bright Lord. Part of this Parish is in <HI>Kent,</HI> and the other part in <HI>Sussex,</HI> distinguished by a small Stream which rises nere <HI>Cowden,</HI> and glides through this Town towards <HI>Medway.</HI> The Lordship of <HI>Lamberhurst</HI> it self, with the Mannor of <HI>Woodroff,</HI> belonged to the Monastery of <HI>Roberts Bridge,</HI> and after the Dissolution, were, by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted in the thirteenth of his Reign to Sir <HI>William Sidney,</HI> Tutor to King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, when he was Prince, whose Successor <HI>Robert Sidney</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> sold <HI>Lamberherst</HI> in our Fathers Memory to Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> and <HI>Woodroff</HI> to Sir <HI>Edw. Henden,</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who bequeathed it to his Nephew Sir <HI>John Henden</HI> lately deceased.</P>
<P><HI>Hodleigh</HI> in this Parish, was part of that Demeasne which related to the Col∣ledge of <HI>Lingfield</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> which upon the Suppression, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to <HI>Thomas Cardan,</HI> from which Family it passed away to <HI>Edward Filmer</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to Sir <HI>Edward Filmer,</HI> eldest Son to Sir <HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> lately de∣ceased, to whose Demeasne, the Propriety of it, is at present united.</P>
<P>The Abby of <HI>Begham</HI> in this Parish, was founded by <HI>Ela de Sackvill,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert de Thurneham,</HI> a man of principal Account in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Prio∣ry was suppressed by</HI> Cardi∣nal Wol∣sey.</NOTE> and filled with Cannons <HI>Praemonstratenses,</HI> or white Cannons called so from their Habit. The Mannor which belonged to it, was by royal Concession. From Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it passed away to <HI>Anthony Brown,</HI> Viscount <HI>Montague,</HI> who not long after alienated the Fee-simple to Alderman <HI>Barneham</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who gave it to <HI>Benedict</HI> a second Son; and he dying without Issne-male, one of his Daughters and Coheirs, married with <HI>Dobell</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and so carried it into the Inheritance of that Family, where the Possession has ever since been setled.</P>
<P><HI>Scotney</HI> in this Parish, which hath borrowed that Appellation from its locall Situation, and the over-shooting of the Water, was the Residence of a Family distinguished by that Sirname and Denomination: for one <HI>Walter de Scotney,</HI> in Times of high Ascent, was Proprietary of this Place, but added not much Reputation to this Mansion, (for as <HI>Edmund de Hadenham,</HI> a Chronicler of great Antiquity, attests) he in the year 1259, administred poyson by tacit Strata∣gem, to the Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and his Brother, to destroy them; of which the last dyed, and the first, escaped not without Danger of Life. But to goe on: After this Family was mouldered away at this place, which was about the midst of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the eminent Family of <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> of <HI>Ashburnham</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> were entituled to the Signiory of it. <HI>Roger Ashburnham,</HI> who was one of the
<PB N="210" REF="113"/>Conservators of the Peace for this County of <HI>Sussex,</HI> in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, had here a castellated Mansion, did sometimes inhabit at this place, and was by his Successor sold to <HI>Henry Chichley</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> who gave it as Dower to his Niece <HI>Florence Chichley,</HI> married to <HI>Jo. Darrell</HI> of <HI>Cale-hill:</HI> and he assigned it for the Lively-hood of his second Son, whose Posterity have ever since enjoyed it.</P>
<P>Here was also in this Parish the Mansion of the <HI>Chitcrofts,</HI> a Family of worth and eminent degree. Their Blazon was precisely the same with the <HI>Colepepers</HI> of <HI>Bay-hall</HI> not far distant, as if they had been a Cadet of the same House. This is a matter which falls within the Cognizance of my Profession, and because I meet with diverse ancient Houses in this County, which did the like as well as in other Counties; I cannot leave it without setting down such Notes and Ob∣servations, as have been made upon it, having met with so many Examples, of that kind, in the Survey of this Province: For instance, St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> of St. <HI>Nicho∣las</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Thanett,</HI> in the very Eastern part of the Shire, and <HI>Peckham</HI> in the Western side of this County, bear the same very Coat Armour; because per∣adventure, they held Land of the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> to whose Arms they did desire their own might be assimilated. <HI>Tutsham</HI> of <HI>Tutsham-hall</HI> in <HI>West-Farleigh,</HI> and <HI>Eastan∣grave</HI> of <HI>Eastangrave</HI> in <HI>Eden Bridge,</HI> bear both alike: <HI>Brenley</HI> of <HI>Brenley</HI> in <HI>Bough∣ton</HI> under <HI>Blean,</HI> and <HI>Ratling</HI> of <HI>Ratling</HI> in <HI>Nonington,</HI> have no distinction; <HI>Peyforer</HI> of <HI>North-court</HI> in <HI>Eseling,</HI> and <HI>Lenham</HI> of <HI>Lenham,</HI> lay claim to an Identitie of Impresse or Coat Armour; and lastly, so did <HI>Watringbury</HI> of <HI>Watringbury,</HI> and <HI>Savage</HI> of <HI>Bobbing-court.</HI> Now the Reason of this neere similitude, was to pre∣serve the Memory of those, though otherwise of different Families, who had gi∣ven them Education; or else, by particular Feoffments, had endowed them with Land; or lastly, as an acknowledgement of the Service and Fealty they owed them, because they held their Lands by some petty Rent, Charge, or Homage, of some principall Mannor, of which they whose Coat-Armour they had thus imitated were Proprietaries.</P>
<P><HI>West-Langdon</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Bewsborough,</HI> and was a Mannor belonging to the Abbey of <HI>West-Langdon,</HI> which was founded by Sir <HI>William de Auberville</HI> of <HI>Westenhanger</HI> Knight, to the Honour of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and filled with white Cannons or Cannons <HI>Praemonstratenses,</HI> in the time of <HI>Richard</HI> the first. <HI>Hugh de Auberville</HI> the Founder's Son, and Sir <HI>William Auberville</HI> Son to this <HI>Hugh,</HI> were Benefactors to this House, and this last, Sir <HI>Williams</HI> only Daughter and Heir, being married to <HI>Nicholas de Crioll</HI> of <HI>Bellaview</HI> nere <HI>Limne Hill,</HI> brought this Monastery, to be under the Patronage of the <HI>Criolls,</HI> whose Demeasn upon the Dissolution, being made the Incom of the Crown, it here resided till Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it, with all the priviledges annexed to it, in the thirty third year of her Rule to <HI>Samuel Thornehill</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Esquire, father to Sir <HI>Timothy Thornehill,</HI> upon whose Decease his Lady Dowager had <HI>West-Langdon</HI> assigned to her by Right of Jointure, as being enstated before upon her in Marriage.</P>

<P><HI>Langley</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was in elder times the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Ashway; Will. de Ashway</HI> is by the book styled <HI>Testa de Nevil,</HI> represented to have held it, and have paid an auxiliary supply for it at the Marriage of <HI>Isabel</HI> Sister to <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the twentieth year of his reign.

<P><HI>Lee</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackheath,</HI> in Barbarous old Latine written <HI>Laga,</HI> was the residence of an ancient generous Family called <HI>Bankwell:</HI> and there is a place in this parish called <HI>Bankers,</HI> by Corruption of the Name,, which, in Orthography of more Antiquity and Truth, was written <HI>Bankwells;</HI> from whence, certainly, at first issued this Sirname. In the thirty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>John de Bankwell</HI> had a Grant by the King's Charter, to have Free-Warren to all his Lands in <HI>Lee, Levesham</HI> and <HI>Bromley.</HI> And in the return of <HI>John de Shelving</HI> High Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the sixteenth and part of the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, of all the Knights and men at Arms in this Connty, <HI>William de Bankwell</HI> is mentioned in the second degree; he dyed the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left <HI>Thomas Bankwell</HI> his Heir; who in the thirty fifty year of that Prince's Government, deceased possest of <HI>Lee,</HI> and a very large proportion of other Land in <HI>Modingham, Sherfholt</HI> (now, I think, corruptly called <HI>Shrawfield</HI>) <HI>Littlecroft Bankers,</HI> both in <HI>Lee, Bromley, Levesham Eltham, Chiselhurst, Detling, Langshot,</HI> and <HI>Wickham</HI> by <HI>Bromley;</HI> and left three Sons, accor∣ding to the Custome of <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> Heirs to his Inheritance, which were <HI>John, William</HI> and <HI>Robert Bankwell:</HI> but upon the distinguishing the Estate into parcels, <HI>Lee, Ban∣kers,</HI> and <HI>Sherfholt,</HI> now corruptly called <HI>Shrawfield,</HI> fell to be the patrimony of <HI>John Bankwell,</HI> and in this Mans Lineage did the Inheritance of these places divers years reside; till the Name was circumscribed in a Female Heir, who being wedded to <HI>John Arrapon,</HI> brought this place to be an adjunct to his Inheritance: And here, I confess, for want of information either from publick or private Record, I am at a losse, and cannot discover, whether by <HI>Arrapon</HI> it was sold to the Crown, and from the Crown transmitted to <HI>Woodvill,</HI> or else immediately passed away by sale to <HI>Richard Woodvill,</HI> Earl <HI>River,</HI> who enjoyed it: but upon his Son's untimely death on a Scaffold at <HI>Pomfret,</HI> being by the malice and subtlety of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, blasted with an As∣persion of Treason, that fatal Stroke which separated his Head from his Body, divided his Estate here from this Name and Family, and united it by Escheat to the Crown: In whose Revenue it was resident, until King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, (as is manifest by the original Patent) granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Wroteley.</HI> In times of a more modern As∣pect, that is, about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Thomas Sackvill</HI> Lord <HI>Buckhurst;</HI> but how it devolved to him, I confesse, I know not; and from him it descended to his Grandchild <HI>Richard Sackvill</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> who exchanged it with King <HI>James;</HI> whose Successor King <HI>Charls,</HI> sold the Royaltie and Fee-simple of it to <HI>Ralph Freeman</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> who gave it in Marriage with his Daughter and Heir to Sir <HI>George Sonds</HI> of <HI>Leeze-Court</HI> in <HI>Shelvich,</HI> Knight of the Bath, who by a Right derived from that Match, is the present Lord of <HI>Lee,</HI> and its two Appendages <HI>Bankers</HI> and <HI>Shrawfield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leeds, Town</HI> and <HI>Castle,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> and were by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour in the twentieth year of his Reign (as appears by the Text of <HI>Dooms∣day</HI> Book) assigned to <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> whom he had constituted one of the Trustees to assist his Cousin <HI>John de Fiennes,</HI> in the Conservation and Guard of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, who chose this for the Capital Seat of his Barony of <HI>Crevequer,</HI> or <HI>decrepito Corde,</HI> for so it is rendered in Latin, and of <HI>Chetham</HI> near <HI>Rochester</HI> (for of that place likewise, he and his posterity sometimes writ themselves Barons) and here erected a stupendous Castle, which because it was environed with Water,
<PB N="213" REF="114"/>was called the Moat. <HI>Hamon de Crevequer</HI> married <HI>Matilda</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir of <HI>William de Averenches,</HI> Baron of <HI>Folkstone,</HI> and had Issue by her, <HI>Robert de Crevequer,</HI> who by Disloyalty lost himself, and his Soveraign's Favour.

The History is well made up by many Authors; the Abstract is thus. Queen <HI>Isabel,</HI> Wife to <HI>Edward</HI> the second, who had ever been the Nurse of peace, and laboured to accord the King and his Barons, making her progresse towards <HI>Canterbury,</HI> was disposed to lodge in this Castle, as belonging to the Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> who had been long King <HI>Edward's</HI> Steward; and sending her Marshal to make ready for her and her Train, they who kept the Castle, told him plainly that neither the Queen nor any else, should enter without Letters from their Lord. The Queen her self goes to the Castle, and receives the same Answer: whereupon she is necessitated to take such Lodging otherwhere as could be provided: Of which Indignity she complains to the King, who resent∣ed it with so much passion, as instantly with an Army collected in <HI>London,</HI> he layes Siege to the Castle, carries it, hangs the Castellan <HI>Thomas Colepeper,</HI> sends the Lady and Children of the Lord <HI>Badelesmer</HI> to the Tower, and seises upon his Goods and Treasure. He, to revenge this Devastation of his Castle, associates with the Barons, then in Arms, who pretended the Common good and publick Liberty of the People (they being still that unhappy Vessel which every Tempest shipwracks, but no Calm secures: Or, indeed, being like the Sea, which never swells into Disorder, untill it be breath'd upon by intemperate Winds; and yet even those very Winds break to pieces those waters which they first raised into Billows and Surges.) But, to go on; This Design (whether the Foundation, on which it was fixt, were crazy and infirme or not, I know not) was Ruinous to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> and the Barons his Partisans; for they were defeared by the Forces of King <HI>Edward,</HI> and amongst the rest this Lord, and the Lord <HI>Ashburnham</HI> being by their misfortune made prisoners, were put to Death at <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Shipwrack, this Castle reverts to the Crown; and Arch-bishop <HI>Arundell</HI> having a mind equivalent to his Birth, gets such a Grant of this Castle, as in many Acts of his, he dates them, At his Castle of <HI>Leeds:</HI> and you may observe that this would not serve the turn neither, for he was at the same time Constable of the late before builded Castle of <HI>Quinborough.</HI> But the Estate he had in it determined with him, and then it remained in the Crown, and was reputed one of the Kings Houses, and the Custody was conferred upon some of the principal Gentlemen of <HI>Kent,</HI> whom the King <HI>pro tempore</HI> favoured. And it seems it had the Reputation to be a piece of important Strength in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth: for <HI>Richard</HI> the second, as <HI>Fabian</HI> in his Chronicle relates <HI>fol.</HI> 165. was by that Prince sent prisoner to this Castle. In the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, I find the propriety of it altered; for that Prince seeking to endear the <HI>St. Legers</HI> to him, who were then a Family who had a powerfull Influence upon this County, made <HI>Ralph St. Leger</HI> Esquire, Constable of the Castle of <HI>Leeds,</HI> and annexed the park too, to his Grant,
<PB N="214" REF="115"/>(for anciently there belonged two Parks unto it, though both are now clearly dis∣parked and vanished) but the Fee-simple remained in the Crown, untill <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth in the fourth year of his Rule, granted it to <HI>Anthony St. Leger</HI> his Suc∣cessor, who was Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and improved the <HI>English</HI> Interest in that Province by his Prudence and Magnanimity to that heighth and Advantage that he re∣duced most of the old Septs of the <HI>Irih</HI> Nobility, and made them become Feodall to the <HI>English</HI> Scepter, which could never be accomplished since the first Conquest of <HI>Ireland,</HI> till his Time; but his Son Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger</HI> was the last of the Name, who was proprietary of <HI>Leeds</HI>-Castle, for he sold it to Sir <HI>Richard Smith,</HI> who not long after determined in two Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to Sir <HI>Timothy Thorn∣hill</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> and to Mr. <HI>Barrow</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who both by mutual Consent did devest themselves of their Interest in it, and by Sale transplanted the Inheritance into Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> now of the Parish of <HI>Hollingbourne,</HI> who setled it in marriage upon his Son Sir <HI>Cheyney Colepeper</HI> now Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>The Priory of <HI>Leeds</HI> was founded by <HI>Robert de Crevequer,</HI> soon after the building of the Cattle, and not long after the Conquest, and stored with black Canons, or Canons of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> and dedicated to St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI> The Successors of this <HI>Robert de Crevequer</HI> were all of them Benefactors. <HI>Robert de Crevequer</HI> Son of <HI>Dan. de Crevequer,</HI> who was Son of <HI>Rob. de Crevequer</HI> the Founder, <HI>dedit Terras Canoni∣cis de Leed pro Salute Animae Reg. Hen. secundi qui eum aluit &amp; Militem fecit</HI> (says the <HI>Coucher</HI> Book.) There was a goodly Church annexed to this Priorie, parallel to many Cathedrals, whose Glory and Beauty were both blasted when the Priorie above men∣tioned suffered the Common Calamity of that great Tempest of the Dissolution. This, upon that Suppression, augmenting the Revenue of the Crown continued with it, until K. <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth in the fourth year of his reign, passed it away by Grant to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Wartham St. Leger,</HI> about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Norden,</HI> and not long after alienated his right in it to <HI>Francis Colepeper</HI> Esquire, who not long after disposed of it again by Sale to <HI>Norden,</HI> in which Family it rested, until the same vicissitude brought it to be the Inheritance of <HI>Covert,</HI> from which Family hath the Fate of Sale not many years since brought it to be the instant Patrimony of Sir <HI>William Merideth.</HI></P>

<P>There is another Mannor in this Parish called <HI>Philipotts,</HI> which yielded a Sirname to a Family so styled, and in a Deed which bears Date from the twenty eighth year of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the first, whereby one <HI>John de Philipott,</HI> does demise some parcels of Land, to <HI>Ro∣bert Charles</HI> Bailiff of the Forest of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> he writes himself <HI>de Philipotts</HI> in <HI>Leigh:</HI> but as all things have their Revolution, which gives either their own Ruines or Ob∣livion to them for a Sepulchre; so it was here: For after this place had for some Hun∣dreds of years been wrapt up in the Inheritance of this Family, it at last came down to <HI>Thomas Philipott,</HI> whose Daughter and Heir <HI>Alice,</HI> was married to <HI>John Petley</HI> Esquire, and so <HI>Philipotts</HI> fell under the Signiory of that Family: but long it continued not there, for this man determined in four Daughters and Coheirs, one of whom matching with <HI>Children,</HI> a Family so called, interwove it with his Demeasne; in which Name, after it had for some years been fixed, it was not long since by the Daughter and Heir of this Name, brought to be the Inheritance of <HI>Polhill.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Royton</HI> in this Parish, had very good Gentlemen so styled, who were no small space possessed of it, and had a Free Chappel founded by <HI>Robert de Royton,</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, from whence it borrowed the Name of <HI>Royton</HI> Chappel, it being annexed to this mansion. The Daughter and Heir of <HI>Royton</HI> was wedded to <HI>James Driland</HI> of <HI>Davington,</HI> and so this place became appropriated to the Interest of that Family; but shortly after, <HI>Constance</HI> Daughter and Heir of this man, married <HI>Walsingham</HI> of <HI>Chiselhurst,</HI> whose Son <HI>James Walsingham,</HI> passed it a∣way
<PB N="216" REF="116"/>by Sale to <HI>Robert Atwater</HI> of <HI>Putwood</HI> in <HI>Otteringden;</HI> and he not long after con∣cluding likewise in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Mary,</HI> she by her Marriage with <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> Esquire, a younger Branch of the <HI>Honywoods</HI> of <HI>Elmsted,</HI> knit this Place to the Patrimony of that Family; and <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> this Mans Son gave it in Dower with his Daughter to <HI>Thomson,</HI> descended from the <HI>Thomsons</HI> of <HI>Petham.</HI></P>
<P>There are two other Mannors in <HI>Lenham</HI> of Signal Estimate; the First is <HI>West-Shelve,</HI> written likewise <HI>Middle-Shelve;</HI> it was parcel of the Estate of <HI>Bertram de Criol,</HI> and by <HI>Joan</HI> his Daughter and Heir was linked to the Revenue of her Husband Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> from whom the Fate of Female Interest devolved it on <HI>Thomas de Poynings;</HI> and to this Family was it for many ages fastned, till Sir <HI>Edw. Poynings,</HI> ex∣tracted lineally from this Man, in the fourteenth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, was found to have died both without lawful Issue, and without Alliance: and so this Name being both in the direct and collateral Line extinguished, the Crown laid claim to this Man∣nor as <HI>de Jure</HI> escheated; and in the seventeenth year of his Government, <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted it to <HI>John Mills,</HI> where after the possession had for some Time continued, it was by Purchase brought into the Inheritance of <HI>Darel,</HI> by whose Female Heir it is now brought to own the Signorie of <HI>Wilkinson.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shelve Cobham</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Lenham</HI> which in elder Times was folded up in the Inheritance of the Lords

<P><HI>Sindall</HI> is the last place of Account, in this Parish of <HI>Lenham;</HI> which as appears by the Evidences of this place, was, in the Raign of King <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname, and as appears by some old Rolls and Ar∣morials were Gentlemen of prime Note in this Track, but continued not long owners of this Mansion; for in the twenty third year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, I find it in the Hands of <HI>Fulk de Peyforer,</HI> and in this Family did it fix, until the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and then it was passed away to <HI>Henman,</HI> in which Name the Interest of this Place, from the fiftieth year of the above Prince, by a derivation of several Descents, until this present year 1658, hath been successively resident.</P>
<P><HI>Leveland</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Denomination; for I find that <HI>Giles de Badelesmer</HI> of <HI>Badelesmer</HI> not far distant, was par∣doned by <HI>Hen.</HI> the third, for matching with <HI>Margaret de Leveland</HI> the Heir of this Place, without the Kings especial License, as is manifest, <HI>Pat.</HI> 40. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. <HI>Memb.</HI> 8.

<PB N="217" REF="116"/>this Family of <HI>Shench,</HI> was not so entirely invested in the Signory of <HI>Leveland,</HI> but that a considerable Proportion of it augmented the Patrimony of <HI>Northwood;</HI> for <HI>Robert de Northwood,</HI> held an Estate here at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Lewsham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackheath,</HI> was a Mannor which belonged to the Priory which was erected here; but who was the Founder is unknown.

<P><HI>Leybourne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkfield,</HI> was the ancient Demeasn of the Lords <HI>Leybourne,</HI> who erected here a Castle esteemed a strong Pile in our Ancestors Dayes: however the Ruines and Raggs of it at present appear mean and despicable, yet it hath by several Gradations sunk into this Condition. The first of which Family which I find to be eminent, was,

<P>The <HI>Grange</HI> in this Parish, is the Mansion of Mr. <HI>Robert Oliver;</HI> and hath been for sundry Descents, resident in that Name, though the Original Sirname be <HI>Quintin.</HI> They being Descended from <HI>Anselinus</HI> or <HI>Anselmus de Quintin,</HI> that paid respective Aid for the Mannor of <HI>Woodfold</HI> in <HI>Yalding,</HI> in the twentyeth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight. Now if you will know how the Name of <HI>Quintin</HI> resolved into that of <HI>Oliver,</HI> I shall inform you. <HI>William Quintin</HI> Purchased Lands in <HI>Seal</HI> called <HI>Hilks,</HI> the eleventh of <HI>February,</HI> and in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and in the Deed of Purchase, he is often called <HI>Filius Oliveri,</HI> without the Addition of <HI>Quintin,</HI> and so by vulgar acceptation, and inadvertency, they came by common mistake to be called <HI>Oliver;</HI> yet in all Deeds and other Escripts, to preserve their Ancient and Original Denomination, they write <HI>Oliver, alias Quintin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lidde,</HI> in old <HI>Saxon</HI> Records is written <HI>Hlida,</HI> which certainly was derived from the Latine word <HI>Litus;</HI> it importing as much in that Dialect, likewise, as the Shore, and the Situation of the place, being not far distant from the Sea; does seem to abett the Etymologie. It is Situated in the Hundred of <HI>Langport,</HI> which extracts its Name from a Mannor in this Parish, called <HI>Old Langport,</HI> which was the Possession of a Family whose Sirname was <HI>Ikin.</HI> And <HI>John Ikin</HI> I find by an Inquisition taken in the thirty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was at his Death, which was then, poss∣est of it. After <HI>Ikin,</HI> a good old Family called <HI>Hund,</HI> were Lords of the Inheri∣tance; and Sir <HI>John Hund</HI> who lies buried in the Church of <HI>Lidde,</HI> lived here in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. From this Family it by Sale passed away to <HI>Belknap;</HI> in, which Name the Possession had not been long resident, for Sir <HI>Edward Belknap</HI> Son to Sir <HI>Henry Belknap,</HI> who Purchased this place, died without Issue, and so his three Sistrs <HI>Anne, Elizabeth,</HI> and <HI>Alice,</HI> became his three Co-heirs, who married to Sir <HI>Edward Wotton,</HI> Sir <HI>Philip Cooke</HI> of <HI>Giddy</HI>-Hall, and Sir <HI>William Shelley</HI> of <HI>Michael∣grove</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> who sold his proportionable Share in this Mannor to <HI>Dannett,</HI> and from <HI>Wotton</HI> and <HI>Dannett,</HI> two parts of it were afterwards conveyed away by Sale to <HI>Godfrey,</HI> and the third was alienated by <HI>Cooke,</HI> to Sir <HI>Christoph. Man</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>New-Langport,</HI> called likewise <HI>Langport Septuans,</HI> was for many Descents the Patri∣mony of that Noble Family. <HI>Robert de Septuans</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and after him his Grandchild <HI>William Septuans</HI> or <HI>de Septemvannis,</HI> was possest of it in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and so remained by the links of some Descents fastned to the Inheritance of this Family, till <HI>William Septuans</HI> this mans great Grandchild, by Sale translated his Right in it to <HI>John Writtle,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth: where after the Possession had some years settled, it was by Sale supplanted, and Seated in <HI>Henry Fettiplace,</HI> of <HI>Beselslith,</HI> in the County of <HI>Oxford;</HI> where after it had for many years been fixed, it was at length sold from this Family, to <HI>James.</HI> But here it had a very short abode, for <HI>Thomas James</HI> falling under a <HI>praemunire,</HI> in the sixth year of the Raign of King <HI>James,</HI> forfeited it to the Crown, and that Prince the next year after, passed it away to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Haddington;</HI> and he not long after, to discharge some Debts in which he was

<P><HI>Jacks, alias Jaques-Court</HI> in this Parish, was the Demeasne of <HI>Echingham,</HI> a Family of principal Note in <HI>Sussex,</HI> where they were, <HI>Jure Nativo,</HI> Seneschalls of the Rape of <HI>Hastings,</HI> and of a proportionate Revenue at <HI>Echingham</HI> in that County. The first that I find of note in this place, was <HI>William de Echingham,</HI> who paid respective Aid, in the twentyeth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for Lands which he held here, and in <HI>Welland-Mersh,</HI> by the fourth part of a Knights Fee; and in this Family did it for sundry Ages reside, and was productive of men that were very usefull and subservient to the Interest of their Country, where∣of <HI>William Echingham,</HI> Son of the former <HI>William,</HI> was one of the Conservators of the Peace, for the County of <HI>Sussex,</HI> in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and died possest of this place, in the fifteenth year of that Prince: But at length the Distaff prevailed against the Speare; for this Family concluded in a Female Heir; for <HI>Thomas Echingham</HI> dying without Issue-male, <HI>Margaret</HI> his only Daughter was married to <HI>Walter Blount,</HI> who had by her <HI>Jacks-Court,</HI> which he left to his Son <HI>Edw. Blount</HI> Lord <HI>Montjoy:</HI> but he at his Decease leaving no Issue, the Inheritance of this place, came to <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Sister and Heir, married to Sir <HI>Andrew Windsor,</HI> afterwards created Lord <HI>Windsor</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, who alienated this Mansion to <HI>Clache,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir, it came to be the Possession of <HI>Stringer;</HI> and he ending likewise in a Female Heir, she brought it to <HI>Scot,</HI> a Cadet of <HI>Scots-Hall;</HI> who sud∣denly after sold his Right in it to <HI>VVilcocks,</HI> by whose two Daughters and Coheirs, in the Memory of these Times, it came to be divided between their two Husbands <HI>Bates,</HI> and <HI>Knight.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Scotney</HI> was the Seat of a Family so called; for in the (Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) there is a recitall of one <HI>Richard de Scotney,</HI> who held Lands in the <HI>Mersh</HI> not far distant: after∣wards it came to the <HI>Ashburnhams</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> but whether by Purchase, or by Marriage of the Heir of <HI>Scotney,</HI> is incertain; though I rather believe it devolved to them by Marriage, because <HI>Scotney</HI> in <HI>Lamberhurst,</HI> divided by a remote distance from this place, was likewise theirs; from <HI>Roger Ashburnham</HI> it came to <HI>Henry Chichley</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and he by Gift tied it to his Foundation of <HI>All-Souls</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> to whose Revenue it remains at this instant time united.</P>
<P><HI>Nod</HI> in this Parish of <HI>Lidde,</HI> was for sundry Ages the Residence of the <HI>Derings,</HI> before they were transplanted to <HI>Pluckley,</HI> and here are Lands Situated within the Verge of this Parish, which by an undivided prescription of many Ages have been named <HI>Derings;</HI> and <HI>Derings-Mersh,</HI> (a certain Evidence to enforce the Antiquity of this Family.)

<P><HI>Lidden</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Folkstone</HI> and <HI>Bewsborough,</HI> was a Mannor which in elder Times made up that vast Patrimony which related to the Knights Templers in this County: but upon the totall Extirpation of that Order here in <HI>England,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, it was by the Statute called <HI>Statutum de Terris Tem∣plariorum,</HI> made in the seventeenth year of that Prince's Government, settled by that solemne Act upon the Knights Hospitalers, and remained treasured up in their Revenue, untill the Disbanding and finall Dissipation of this Order in this Nation, by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.

<P><HI>Coclescombe,</HI> and <HI>Swinkfield-Mennes,</HI> were of the same Complexion with the for∣mer, that is, they were first enwrapped in the Demeasne of the Knights Templers, and afterwards supplanted, and fastned to the Revenue of the Knights Hospitalers, to whose Interest it continued firme, untill the Whirl-wind of the publique Sup∣pression in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, ravished them away; and then that Prince in the thirty third year of his Raign, by Royall Concession, made them the Inheri∣tance of <HI>Edward Monins</HI> Esq; from whom, by Successive Devolution, they are now come down to his Descendant Sir <HI>Edward Monins</HI> of <HI>Waldershare,</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Swanton-Court</HI> is the last Place in this Parish, which Summons our Remembrance.

<P><HI>Lyminge</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Court-At-Street,</HI> and was anciently Famous for Land which was given here, by <HI>Edbaldus,</HI> Son of <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King <HI>Kent,</HI> to his Sister <HI>Edburga,</HI> upon which she erected a Nunnery, and Dedicated it to the Honour of St. <HI>Mildred:</HI> But the Mannor which belonged to it, was upon the Suppression, granted by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to the See of <HI>Canterbury:</HI> and Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer</HI> in the twenty ninth of that Prince's Government, exchanged it for other Lands with the Crown: and the above-said <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty sixth year of his Raign, granted it to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> who after, in the Rule of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> was slain at <HI>Callis,</HI> whilst he endevoured to make good that City, and the <HI>English</HI> Interest together, by a noble and generous Resistance against the Furious Impressions and Onsets of the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Army, who then pressed upon it with a straight and vigorous Seige.

<P><HI>East-Leigh</HI> was the Mansion of a Family which took their Denomination from hence; and there is mention in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> of <HI>William de Leigh,</HI> and <HI>Robert de Leigh,</HI> who held Land of the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by Knights Service in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: when this Family was vanished, and had de∣serted the Possession of this place, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; the <HI>Allens,</HI> who came from <HI>Borden</HI> and <HI>Sedingbourne,</HI> were ingrafted into the Inheritance, but enjoyed it not long: for in the Age subsequent to the first Pur∣chase, it was alienated to <HI>Fogge,</HI> who by as short and sudden a Vicissitude, disposed of his Right in it to <HI>Cobbe</HI> of <HI>Cobbes-court,</HI> not far distant, in which Family the Title was as brief, and as incertain, as in any of the former; for by them, after a Possession of some few years it was alienated to <HI>Salkeld</HI> descended originally from the <HI>Salkelds</HI> of the North-riding in <HI>York-shire</HI> and Bishoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Pimps Court</HI> that gave Name to the Knightly Family of the <HI>Pimps,</HI> is in this Parish, although they made <HI>Nettlested</HI> their more frequent place of abode; <HI>William de Pimpe</HI> held this and other Lands by a whole Knights Fee, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight: and from this <HI>William</HI> was <HI>John Pimpe</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, lineally descended, who sold this Place to <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> Lord Constable of <HI>England,</HI> whose dysastrous Fate having engaged him to make some dark Applications to a Wizard and a Monk, about the Succession of the Crown; <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, a Prince of much Jelousie and Fury. like an Industrious Spider spun out Ve∣nome enough out of this unhappy Address of his, to poyson him with the Guilt of High Treason, and so made the forfeiture of his Life and Fortune pay the price of his Vanity: upon whose Ruine his Estate was, not long after his Death and Attaint, which was in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by that Prince granted to his Confident and Favourite Sir <HI>John Rainsford,</HI> who after a brief enjoyment of it, passed it away to Sir <HI>Henry Isley,</HI> who being attainted in the second year of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> for supporting by his Assistance and Concurrence the Defection of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat</HI> this reverted to the Crown, and the same Princess in the second year of her Government, granted it by Patent to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, hath lately passed it away to <HI>Thomas Floyd</HI> of <HI>Gore Court</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Luddenham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Middleton,</HI> with the appendant Mannor of <HI>Bishops-Bush,</HI> was a Branch of that spatious Revenue which did in these parts own the <HI>North∣woods</HI> for Possessors: and <HI>Roger de Northwood</HI> in the forty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, amongst divers Parcels of Land which he altered from the Nature of Gavelkind into Knights Service, (of the which there is a particular Recapitulation in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) changed ninety Acres of Mersh Land which lay partly in <HI>Iwade,</HI> and partly in his Mannor of <HI>Luddenham</HI> into that Tenure. After the <HI>Northwoods,</HI> the <HI>Frogenhalls</HI> were Possessors of this place, and <HI>William Frogenhall</HI> had this amongst other Lands in this
<PB N="226" REF="121"/>Track, which he died seised of, in the eighth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second: his Son and Heir was <HI>William Frogenhall</HI> Father to <HI>Thomas Frogenhall</HI> the last of the Name at this Place; for he left no Issue Male: so that the Daughters became his Coheirs. One of whom was <HI>Anne,</HI> who married <HI>Thomas Quadring</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and so this place be∣came hsi Inheritance, as being her Proportion of <HI>Frogenhalls</HI> Estate: but it quickly found an other owner; for <HI>Joan Quadring</HI> his onely Daughter and Heir, by marrying with <HI>Richard Dryland</HI> of <HI>Cokesditch</HI> in <HI>Feversham,</HI> incorporated it with the Demeasn of that Family: since which Alliance, it hath by a constant Succession been fixt in the Possession of the Name of <HI>Dryland;</HI> untill of late years by an Heir General, it came to own the Signory of <HI>Kirton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Luddesdowne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Taltingtrough,</HI> was (though now a petty obscure Village) more noted formerly, when it was the Patrimony of the Barons <HI>Montchensie</HI> of <HI>Swanscamp-Castle. Warren de Montchensie,</HI> one of them, obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to this Mannor of <HI>Ludsdowne,</HI> in the thirty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third: afterwards this Mans Successor <HI>William de Monchensie</HI> held it, and sat in Parliament as Baron of <HI>Swanscamp,</HI> and dying in the year 1287, without Issue Male, left this and diverse other Places to <HI>Dionys</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, who was married to <HI>Hugh de Vere;</HI> but died without Issue, in the year of our Lord, 1314, by which means the Title of this Place diverted to <HI>Joan de Montchensie,</HI> Sister to <HI>William</HI> above-named, and She matched in Marriage with <HI>William de Valentia</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> half Brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and by him had <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> who expired in two Female Coheirs, one of whom called <HI>Isabel,</HI> was married to <HI>Lawrence de Hastings,</HI> who in her Right was afterwards Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and Proprietary of the Fee-simple of this Place; from whom it descended to his Grand-child <HI>John Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pem∣broke,</HI> who dying in the fourteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, left his Estate in <HI>Kent,</HI> in which this was involved to his two Kinsmen, <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> and <HI>Richard Talbot,</HI> and upon the Division of it, this Mannor was lincked to the Patrimony of <HI>Grey,</HI> and remained untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fixth, interwoven with the Revenue of this Family, and then I find it under the Signory of that eminent Peer and glorious Souldier <HI>Thomas Montacute</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who in so many remarkable and trium∣phant Conflicts, asserted the Interest of this Nation in <HI>France,</HI> in the Raign of the a∣bovesaid Prince, and at last received a mortal Wound, by a Splinter of a Window struck into his Face by a Cannon shot at the Siege of <HI>Orleans,</HI> of which he died 1428, and left his Estate here to his Natural Son <HI>James Montacute,</HI>

<P><HI>Buckland</HI> in this Parish, did acknowledge the <HI>Bucklands</HI> for its Heirs and Possessors, who sometimes did inhabit at <HI>Preston</HI> in <HI>Shorham,</HI> and sometimes at this place; which however now obscure and despicable, was of Credit when Sir <HI>John Buckland</HI> paid re∣spective Aid for his Lands at <HI>Ludsdown,</HI> at the making of the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; from <HI>Buckland</HI> by a Daughter and Heir, some few Ages since, it came over with <HI>Preston</HI> in <HI>Shorham,</HI> to <HI>Folhill,</HI> and in that Family is the Title still at this instant resident.</P>
<P><HI>Lullingston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Axtan,</HI> was in ancient Records written <HI>Lullingston Rosse;</HI> for <HI>Anketellus Rosse</HI> held Lands here in the twentieth of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; <HI>William de Rosse</HI> this mans Grand-child (as appears by the Pipe Rolls) held two Knights Fees in <HI>Lullingston,</HI> in the first year of King <HI>John. Alexander de Rosse</HI> this mans Son was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae,</HI> or of the grand Assise about the end of that Prince's Rule; but not long after this the Possession of this place was not lincked to this Family; for <HI>Lora de Rosse</HI> Sole Daughter to <HI>William de Rosse,</HI> by match∣ing with <HI>William de Peyforer,</HI> fastned it to the Revenue of that Stock, from whence it
<PB N="227" REF="121"/>assumed the Title of <HI>Lullingston Peyforer;</HI> but it quickly deserted both the Title and Possessor; for <HI>Gregory de Rokesley</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first purchased it of the abovesaid <HI>William,</HI> and in the same year obtained a Charter Warren to his Lands at this place. In the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John de Rokesley</HI> Son to <HI>Walter Rokesley</HI> and Grand-child to the before mentioned <HI>Gregory,</HI> paid Aid for the Mannor of <HI>Lullingston,</HI> which held by a whole Knights Fee, at the making the Black Prince Knight; In the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, Sir <HI>John Peche</HI> purchased the Mannor of this <HI>John de Rokesley;</HI> this Sir <HI>John</HI> was Son to Sir <HI>John de Peche,</HI> who was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, and was called to Parliament among the Barons, in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.

<HEAD>M. M. M. M.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MAidstone</HI> giveth Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is seated: an elegant Town it is, whether we consider it in respect of the uniform and regular Building; or of the healthful Situation of it, spreading it self out partly upon a Hill, and partly upon a Valley; which are interlaced with a smal River which hath its Original about <HI>Leeds,</HI> and on the other side its Banks are washed with the waters of the Medway; from whence it primitively borrowed its Name, being in <HI>Saxon</HI> called <HI>Medwegston.</HI> The Places of most eminence which are circumscribed within the Limits of it are,</P>
<P>First <HI>Buckland,</HI> which is situated on the opposite Banck of the River, upon the Knob or Knoll of an Hill of easie Ascent; from whence it takes in, a various and de∣lightful Prospect of the adjacent Valley; It was anciently part of the Demeasn of the <HI>Bucklands;</HI> but whether it originally gave Seat and Sirname to them or not, is not evident; because there was another Place, which likewise bore this Name at <HI>Luddesdowne,</HI> and which also acknowledged it self to be Parcel of their Proprietie; <HI>John de Buckland</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and his Son and Heir was Sir <HI>John Buckland,</HI> who was a Person of remarkable Repu∣tation and Note in this Track; for he had Lands about <HI>Wouldham, Halling, Snodland, Ludsdowne</HI> and <HI>Shoreham,</HI> as well as at this Place. After this Name went out, the Lords <HI>Cobham</HI> were Proprietaries of <HI>Buckland,</HI> and in this Family was the Possession guided along by an undivided Clew of several Ages, till the infortunate <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> about the entrance into the Raign of King <HI>James,</HI> being with Sir <HI>VValter Raleigh</HI> and others, entangled in a Design, which the then present Power after a serious and solemn Debate adjudged treasonable, he could not unravel himself out of it, but with the Forfeiture though not of Life, yet of Estate; but this Mannor before his Attaint being settled upon his Lady <HI>Francis Cobham,</HI> as part of her Jointure, upon
<PB N="228" REF="122"/>his Decease was granted by the Crown to her, and the Reversion to <HI>Robert Cecil</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> in respect he had married <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Daughter to <HI>William Brooke</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and Sister to this last Lord <HI>Henry,</HI> and She shortly after by marrying with ....... <HI>Fitz Gerald</HI> Earl of <HI>Kildare,</HI> settled the present Interest of it in him, and He and his Countess being embarked in a mutual and joint consent with the above∣mentioned Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> passed away their Right in it, about the year One thou∣sand six hundred and eighteen, to <HI>William Horspoole</HI> Esquire, who, in the Memory of these Times, alienated the Fee-simple to Mr. <HI>English</HI> of <HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the Mannor of <HI>Maidstone</HI> it self with the Palace fall under Considera∣tion. They were in Times of elder Account belonging to the Family of <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and so continued till <HI>William de Cornhill</HI> desiring to exemplifie his Zeal and Devotion by some eminent Acts of Piety to the Religion which those Times asserted, gave them to <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the seventh year of the Raign of King <HI>John;</HI> many of whose Successors were Benefactors both to the Church and Palace. <HI>Boniface</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> (Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>) about four hundred years since, built here an Hospital, then styled the <HI>New-work,</HI> to the Honour of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr; which Hospital <HI>William Courtney</HI> likewise Arch-Bishop pull'd down, and instituted a Colledge upon the Ruines of it; for secular Priests, devoted to the Honour of <HI>All Saints:</HI> And also erected the Collegiate Church, as the Walls, diaper'd in sundry places, with his paternal Coat, do easily evince.</P>
<P><HI>John Ʋfford</HI> also Arch-Bishop about three hundred years since began the Founda∣tion of the Palace here; but dying before he had compleated the same, <HI>Simon Islip</HI> his Successor gave it its Perfection, and being afterwards crumbled into Decay, <HI>Iohn Morton</HI> likewise Arch-Bishop not onely repaired, but augmented it.</P>
<P><HI>Maidston</HI> was governed by a Portreve, until the Time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth: by whose incorporation it came to be governed by a Maior which Priviledge being lost, because this Town was enwrapped in Sir <HI>Thomas Wiats</HI> Insurrection, against Q. <HI>Mary;</HI> Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> not onely restored the same, but, to improve it to more eminence with a farther Addition of Honour, raised it into the Degree of a <HI>Borough.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maidstone</HI> by the Influence of <HI>Boniface</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to be held here weekly on the <HI>Thursday,</HI> as is manifest, <HI>Pat.</HI> 45. <HI>Hen. tertii Memb. secunda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Arundel</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> about two hundred and forty years since erected a Chauntry, for the Brothers of <HI>Corpus Christi,</HI> now converted into the Free-School, who by the Rules of their Primitive Institution were to pray for the Fraternity of the Guild.</P>
<P>The Mannor and Palace of <HI>Maidston</HI> being exchanged with the Crown, by <HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> was by K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, about the thirty second year of his Raign, granted to <HI>Thomas Wiat</HI> the elder, and his infortunate Son Sir <HI>Thomas VViat</HI> being attainted in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> it devolved by Escheat to the Crown, and continued there untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted it to <HI>John Astley</HI> Esq; Master of the Royall Jewells, from whom it descended to Sir <HI>Jacob Astley,</HI> created Lord <HI>Astley,</HI> by the late King <HI>Charles</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in whose Descendants the Propriety is at this instant resident. But the Mannor continued in the Tenure of the Crown, even untill the Raign of King <HI>Charles.</HI> For when King <HI>James</HI> had by his gracious Charter created Dame <HI>Elizabeth Finch,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>Moile Finch</HI> of <HI>Estwell,</HI> onely Daughter and Heir of the right Honourable Sir <HI>Thomas Heneage</HI> of <HI>Copped-hall</HI> in <HI>Essex</HI> Vice-Chamberlane, and one of the Privy Councel to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Vice-Countesse <HI>Maidston,</HI> to her and her Issue-male, She obtained the Mannor in Fee Farme for ever, and transmitted it to her Son Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> in her Right Earl of <HI>VVin∣chelsey,</HI> from whom both the Title of Viscount <HI>Maidston</HI> and the Right of the Mannor are devolved by Paternal Succession, to the Right honourable <HI>Heneage Finch,</HI> the pre∣sent Earl of <HI>VVinchelsey,</HI> and Vicecount <HI>Maidston.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leland</HI> notes that the Arch-Bishop's Palace, was anciently a Castle, and I verily believe it was the <HI>Caput Baroniae:</HI> for the Arch-Bishops had more than one, and ex∣cepting that at <HI>Saltwood,</HI> I have diligently Searched, and can find none so likely as this.</P>
<P><HI>Goulds</HI> and <HI>Shepway</HI> do thirdly expose themselves to our Survey, they were former∣ly
<PB N="229" REF="122"/>the Demeasne of <HI>Vinter</HI> of <HI>Vinters,</HI> not far distant, and so remained till <HI>Robert Vin∣ter</HI> Founded in <HI>Maidston</HI> Church that Chantry, which bears the Name of <HI>Gould's</HI> Chantry, about the fortieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then he annexed both these places to the Found<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, for those Divine Offices which were there to be performed, but upon the Suppression of this Oratorie, King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted <HI>Goulds</HI> and <HI>Shepway</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas VViat,</HI> who afterwards sinking under the crime of High Treason, in the second year of the Government of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> She upon his attaint, granted them to Sir <HI>VValter,</HI> and <HI>Gervas Henley</HI> Esq; from which Family by Purchase they came over to <HI>Andrews,</HI> but stayed not long there, for in our Fathers Memory they were sold to Sir <HI>Humphrey Tufton,</HI> late Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> part of the year 1654. and part of the year 1655.</P>
<P><HI>Bigons, alias Digons,</HI> was the ancient Seat of the worthy Family of the <HI>Mapelysdens,</HI> and I have a Deed in my Custody, wherein one <HI>Edward Mapelysden</HI> is mentioned, with this Addition, <HI>Edwardus Mapelysden de Digons.</HI> The Deed bears Date from the twenty fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and after the possession had been for many Genera∣tions Successively resident in this Family, one of this Name, being unfortunately concerned in the Defection of Sir <HI>Thoma; Wyat,</HI> was blasted with the guilt of High Treason, and so by Consequence his Estate by Confiscation, escheated to the Crown, from which it was granted to <HI>Nicholas Barham,</HI> after Serjeant at Law, who did much improve this Fabrick, with a Supplement of Building, from whose Heir it passed away by Sale to <HI>Hawle,</HI> and from him again soon after to Sir <HI>Francis Berneham,</HI> to whom this Mansion owes much of its Magnificence and Splendor, whose Son and Heir Mr. <HI>Edward Barneham</HI> Esquire, has lately alienated his Interest in it, to Mr. <HI>Beale</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jordans-Court</HI> is a fifth place, which may exact our Notice, because it gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Denomination; the next Family, after this was expired, which held it, was <HI>Roper,</HI> of the <HI>Ropers</HI> of <HI>St. Dunstans</HI> in <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and <HI>John Roper</HI> sold it to <HI>Edw.</HI> and <HI>Wil. Brouch,</HI> of <HI>Bersted</HI> about the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and they quickly after alienated their Concernment to <HI>Atwood,</HI> from whom the same Fate, carried it away to <HI>Peirce,</HI> who by Sale transmitted his Right to <HI>Cook,</HI> and he suddenly after demised it to <HI>Crooke,</HI> where after the Title had made some short abode, the Possession was passed over to <HI>Potkins,</HI> extracted from the <HI>Fotkins</HI> of <HI>Sevenoke,</HI> where the Name was very ancient, from <HI>Potkin;</HI> by his Daughter and Coheir, it de∣scended to <HI>Virgo,</HI> who about the latter end of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by Sale translated the Possession into <HI>Washington</HI> Justice of Peace, and often in the Commission of Sewers, who sold it to <HI>Godwin,</HI> from whom by Purchase, it came to be the Inheritance of <HI>Crisp,</HI> who in our Memory conveyed it away to <HI>Smith;</HI> and he, some few years since, by Sale, invested the Propriety in Mr. <HI>Beckman.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>Sheals</HI> is not to be forgotten, because it was the Inheritance of <HI>Fremingham,</HI> for <HI>Ralph de Fremingham</HI> died seised of it, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and when this Family went out, the <HI>Pimps</HI> of <HI>Pimps-Court</HI> and <HI>Nettlested,</HI> by Purchase became Lords of the Fee; from whom the same Fare brought it to acknowledge the Signory of the <HI>Isleys</HI> of <HI>Sundrich;</HI> and here it continued, till Sir <HI>Henry Isley</HI> in the Raign of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> being attainted of High Treason, it became Confiscated to the Crown, and She in the second year of her Government, granted it to Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Knight, of <HI>Coursehorne</HI> in <HI>Cranbroke,</HI> in whose Name and posierity the Possession has remained Successively planted till this Day.</P>
<P>Seventhly, <HI>Chillington</HI> is not to be omitted, because I find it in the Register of those Lands which acknowledged the Lords <HI>Cobham,</HI> for Lords of the Fee: And when <HI>John de Cobham</HI> had obtained a Charter of Free-warren, in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, to all his Lands in <HI>Kent,</HI> The Mannor of <HI>Chillington</HI> is Recorded in the Catalogue amongst them. After them, it came (as the Court-rolls and private Evi∣dences of this place inform me) to acknowledge the Signory and Jurisdiction of the <HI>Mapelysdens</HI> of <HI>Digons,</HI> and remained circumscribed in their Revenue, till Queen <HI>Mary</HI> began to weild the <HI>English</HI> Scepter, and then <HI>George Mapelysden</HI> being entangled beyond all retreat, in the unsuccessfull Expedition of Sir <HI>Thomas Wyat,</HI> miscarried in that Attempt, and lost his Estate by Forfeiture to the Crown, and Q. <HI>Mary</HI> granted it to Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> and <HI>Gervas Henley</HI> Esquire, who not long after sold his
<PB N="230" REF="123"/>Interest in it to <HI>Nicholas Barham</HI> Esquire, Serjeant at Law to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and his Successor alienated this place to <HI>Hawle</HI> of <HI>Wye,</HI> whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>George Hawle</HI> lately deceased, held the Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P>Lastly, within the Ambute or Limits of <HI>Maidstone,</HI> stands an ancient Castellated House called the Moate. It did in times of great Antiquity, relate to that Patrimo∣ny which confessed the Signory of the noted Family of <HI>Leybourne:</HI> for <HI>Roger de Ley∣bourne</HI> obtained the Grant of a Market weekly on the <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and a Fair yearly to continue three Dayes at the Feast of St. <HI>Cross,</HI> in the fifty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 51. <HI>Hen. tertii Memb.</HI> 10. But before the beginning of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, this Name was withered and shrunk into Decay at this place, and then <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burghurst,</HI> or <HI>Burwash,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and one of the first Founders of the Order of the Garter, came to possesse it, and Inhabited here in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and possessed the Signory called <HI>Shofford,</HI> on which the Castle stands, and which one <HI>John de Shofford</HI> held by Knights-Service, in the twentieth year (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI>) of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After the Lords <HI>Burghurst,</HI> the <HI>Woodvills</HI> were possest of it, and removed from <HI>Grafton</HI> in the County of <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> where they had long continued, and lived here. A fair Monument of <HI>Woodvill,</HI> on the <HI>North</HI>-side the Chancell of <HI>Maidstone</HI>-Church affirms it: and when King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth created <HI>Richard Woodvill</HI> Constable of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> a Baron of this Nation, and elected him into the Order of the Garter, his Style was, Lord <HI>Rivers, Grafton,</HI> and <HI>De la Moat;</HI> which Act of Grace and Favour, mollifi∣ed a Sentence and Fine of 1000. <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> imposed upon him, for matching with <HI>Jaquet,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Luxenbourg,</HI> Earl of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Widow of <HI>John Plantagente</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> without the Kings Licence. But when King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, had mar∣ried <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his eldest Daughter, being widow to <HI>Thomas</HI> Marquesse <HI>Dorcett,</HI> he cre∣ated him Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> and Lord of the Isle of <HI>VVight,</HI> which Titles he had observed were concomitant in some of the Styles of the Lords <HI>Rivers,</HI> or <HI>de Ripariis,</HI> who were the Ancient Earls of <HI>Devon,</HI> and assumed to bear in an Escocheon of pretence upon his own Atchievement, the old Coat ascribed commonly to <HI>Baldwin de Ripariis</HI> Earl of <HI>Devon, viz. Gules a Griphen Segreant Or:</HI> which I note for Criticks in Armorie to descant on, and return to the Historie of the Place. When this good man, for so he was noted to be, was miserably massacred by <HI>Robert Ridisdale</HI> Captain of the Lewd People of <HI>North-Hampton</HI>-shire, who took him at <HI>Edgcot-Field,</HI> and struck off his head at <HI>North-Hampton</HI> (Their Will being their Law, and Mischief Minister to their wild Designs?) all his seven Sons who survived him, died without Issue, and then Sir <HI>Henry VVyat</HI> becomes owner of this place, Grandfather to Sir <HI>Thomas VViat,</HI> afterwards his Successor in the Possession of it, whose dysastrous Tragedy is presented at <HI>Boxley,</HI> upon whose untimely <HI>Exit, Hugh VVarham</HI> in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by Grant from the Crown, enters upon it, from whom Alderman <HI>Rither</HI> afterwards Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> and known by the Name of Sir <HI>VVilliam Rither,</HI> Purchased and Repaired it and left it to his Daughter and Coheir, the Lady <HI>Susan Caesar,</HI> whose eldest Son <HI>Tho. Caesar</HI> Esq; and his Mother concurring together, disposed of their Right in it by Sale to Sir <HI>Humphrey Tufton</HI> Knight, second Son to Sir <HI>John Tufton</HI> Knight and Baronet, and Bro∣ther to <HI>Nicholas Tufton</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanett,</HI> who was Father to <HI>John</HI> the present Earl.</P>
<P>There was a Family Sirnamed <HI>de Maidstone,</HI> whose Blazon upon a Monument in <HI>Ʋlcombe</HI> Church is, <HI>Sables a Cheveron between three Cups, covered, Argent Crowned Or, VVilliam de Maidston</HI> the Kings Valect, being sent to the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> with certain Instruments, and other expresses, deceas'd in his Journey, as appears <HI>Pat.

<P><HI>Pinenden-Heath</HI> confines upon <HI>Maidston,</HI> and is eminent for the Punishment of Ma∣lefactors, and the frequent Assemblies of Free-holders, who here convene to elect such Persons for Knights of the Shire, as may represent the County in Parliament. But it was in elder times more famous for that great Convention of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> who met there in the fourth year of <HI>Wil.</HI> the Conquerour, to decide the great Controversie which then broke forth, between <HI>Lanfranc</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Odo</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> touching some Lands and Priviledges which the said Arch-Bishop alleaged were by an unjust Usurpation by the above-said <HI>Odo</HI> ravished away from the Church: which be∣cause it gives us a full Prospect of that exorbitant and wide power which the Clergie of
<PB N="231" REF="123"/>those times did entitle themselves to. I shall endevour to pourtray it in as Brief and narrow a Landskip, as I have pencill'd it out by <HI>Textus Roffensis,</HI> an old Book in Manuscript so called, where it is more voluminously represented.</P>
<P>At <HI>Pinenden-Heath</HI> (says <HI>Textus Roffensis</HI>) in the fourth year of <HI>William</HI> the Con∣querour, there was an Assemblie of the gravest and discreetest of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> by a signall Decision and Debate, to deternine of that Controversie, which did formerly arise between <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bayeux,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> touching some Lands and Priveledges which were detained from the Church by the said Earl; and <HI>Lanfranc</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The said Dispute or Debate lasted three Dayes: after the expiration of which, the said Arch-Bishop recovered severall Lands which he the said <HI>Odo</HI> and his Tenants then held, which were <HI>Herbert</HI> the Son of <HI>Ivo, Turold</HI> of <HI>Rochester, Ralph de Curva-Spina,</HI> and <HI>Hugh de Montfort,</HI> with all the Franchises belonging to them, as namely, <HI>Sac</HI> and <HI>Soc, Toll</HI> and <HI>Theam, Infangtheof</HI> and <HI>Outfang∣theof, Flymena, Firmth, Grithbreach, Forestall, Heinfare,</HI> and <HI>Cersett;</HI> (the last of which, because none of our Interpreters of the dark and obscure Terms of the Law do ex∣plain, I shall; It was a Rent-charge of a certain Proportion of Corn in the ear, paid at the Feast of St. <HI>Martin,</HI>) with all other Customes greater or less, both on the Land and on the Water; and it was tried and proved by all the honest and wise Men both <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>English</HI> who were present, that as the King himself, holds his Lands quiet, and free in his Demeasne, so the Arch-Bishop holds all his Lands whoily quiet and free in his Demeasne. In the presence of these, it was shewn by many and most evident Reasons, that the King hath no Customes in the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but onely three, which are these. If any man digg in the Kings High-way, or cut down any Tree to stop it, if any man shall be apprehended and found Culpable, whilest they are in doing such things, whether Pledges be taken of them or not, yet by prose∣cution of the Kings Officer, and by Pledges they shall amend what is unjustly done. The third Custome is, If any man commit Blood-shed on the Kings High-way; if whilst he does it he be apprehended and imprisoned, he shall then make amends unto the King: But if he shall not be apprehended, but depart without giving any Pledge, the King may not in Justice require any thing of him. And it was at the same time farther determined, that if any Person did commit Blood-shed, or Manslaughter, in places which were within the Liberties of the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> from the time that the Church left off to Sing <HI>Alleluiah,</HI> to the Octaves of <HI>Easter;</HI> that then he should make amends onely to the Arch-Bishop. And it was likewise shewed at the same Time, that whosoever should commit the Crime of Childwitt, that is, of Ba∣stardy; if it were in Lent, the Arch-Bishop should have the whole Satisfaction; but if out of Lent, then he should have onely half of it.</P>
<P>There were present at this Assembly, <HI>Goisfrid</HI> Bishop of <HI>Constance</HI> the Kings Sub∣stitute, <HI>Ernost</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester, Egelric</HI> or <HI>Agelric</HI> Bishop of <HI>Selsey</HI> and <HI>Chi∣chester,</HI> a Man of deep insight in the Constitutions Ecclesiastical, and of so great an Age, that he was brought in a Wagon, for his Discussion and Declaration, (says <HI>Textus Roffensis</HI>) upon the known Laws, Usages, Franchises, and Customes of Holy Church. <HI>Hugh de Montfort, William de Arces, Richard de Tunbridge;</HI> and lastly, <HI>Haymo.</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Town Malling</HI> and <HI>East Malling</HI> lie in the Hundred of <HI>Larkfield,</HI> and were both Mannors which related to that Revenue, which made up the Patrimony of the Nunnery of <HI>Town Malling,</HI> which was founded by <HI>Gundulphus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ro∣chester,</HI> about the year 1090, and dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and had the Church it self which was likewise named after the blessed Virgin, and the Chappel of St. <HI>Leonards</HI> not far distant. Though this <HI>Gundulphus</HI> was the Founder, yet <HI>Haimo de Heath,</HI> as appears by the Records of <HI>Rochester,</HI> aws an eminent Benefactor to it about the year 1339. Both these Mannors upon the Suppression having aug∣mented the Revenue of the Crown, they rested there, untill the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then they were granted in Lease for Life, to Sir <HI>Hugh Cartwright,</HI> and upon his Decease, they were passed away upon the same Condi∣tion to <HI>Pierpoint;</HI> and he conveyed them to <HI>William Brook</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham;</HI> whose Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> being attainted in the second year of King <HI>James,</HI> they were
<PB N="232" REF="124"/>re-assumed by the Crown, and after granted in Lease, to Sir <HI>Humphrey Delind,</HI> a Man fur∣nished with a liberal stock both of divine and humane Learning; and he passed away his Interest to Sir <HI>Robert Brett:</HI> but the Fee-simple continued with the Crown, until the twenty first of King <HI>James;</HI> and then they were granted for ever to <HI>John Rayney</HI> Esquire, which Concession was fully ratified by King <HI>Charles,</HI> (to whom the Pro∣fits of these Mannors were assigned when he was Prince, towards the Support of of his Court) in the second year of his Raign, to Sir <HI>John Rayney</HI> now of <HI>Wrotham</HI> Knight and Baronet, which Sir <HI>John</HI> is lineally descended from <HI>John Reignie</HI> (for so the Name in old Deeds is written) who held the Mannor of <HI>Edgeford</HI> in <HI>De∣von,</HI> and <HI>Smitheley-hall</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, still the Possession of this Family. Which <HI>John</HI> was originally extracted from Sir <HI>John de Reignie,</HI> who, as is manifest by the old Rolls and Registers of this Family, held the Mannor of <HI>Newton</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P><HI>West-Malling</HI> had a Market granted to it on the <HI>Saturday</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the Instance of the Lady Abbesse of that place: to whom and to the Nuns of this Cloister, the Vicar of <HI>East-Malling,</HI> was, <HI>Jure Loci,</HI> always Confessor.</P>
<P><HI>Parrocks</HI> and <HI>Ewell</HI> are two appendant Mannors, involved in the Mannor of <HI>West-Malling,</HI> whose Fee-simple was passed away to <HI>John Rayney</HI> Esquire, when the o∣ther was linked by Grant to his Demeasne,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ex auto∣graphis pe∣nes</HI> Jo. Reyney, <HI>Millit. &amp; Baronetum</HI></NOTE> the last of which lay in <HI>Brenchley,</HI> and was in Lease many years from the Nunnery to <HI>Hextall,</HI> whose Female Heir brought it to <HI>VVhetenhall;</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard VVhetenhall,</HI> in the twelfth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> sold it to <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and his Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> alie∣nated it to Sir <HI>Thomas Fane</HI> Ancestor to <HI>Mildmay</HI> Earl of <HI>VVestmerland:</HI> whose Lease being lately expired, it is now come to confesse Sir <HI>John Reyney</HI> Knight and Baronet, for sole Proprietarie.</P>
<P><HI>Borough</HI> Court in <HI>East-Malling,</HI> was parcell of the ancient Demease of the no∣ble Family of <HI>Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Preston</HI> in <HI>Alre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford</HI> and was found united to their Revenue, at the Death of <HI>VValter Colepeper</HI> Esquire, which was in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and in this Family did it continue involved for sundry Ages, till all∣most in our Grand-fathers memory, it was by Sale conveyed away to <HI>Shakerley,</HI> descended from the <HI>Shakerleys</HI> of <HI>Shakerley</HI> in <HI>Lancashire:</HI> but it made no long a∣boad here, for in the Age subsequent to that wherein it was purchased, this Fa∣mily resolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Beauley,</HI> descended from the <HI>Beauleys</HI> of <HI>Beauleys</HI> Court in <HI>VVouldham,</HI> who brought <HI>Borough</HI> Court a∣long with her, into the Possession of that Family, and left it to her only Daughter and Heir <HI>Mary Beauley,</HI> who by matching lately with Mr....... <HI>Basse</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> hath made it parcel of his Interest and Propriety.</P>
<P><HI>Marden</HI> is not parcell only of the Hundred of <HI>Middleton</HI> or <HI>Milton,</HI> but an Ap∣pendage of the Mannor also: but because they are divided by so remote a distance, from the above-mentioned place, they in elder Times made their Applications, by humble Addresses to the Crown, of whose Revenue this Parish was a Limb, to rescue them from that Burden, which crushed the shoulder, and to permit that this Parish. <HI>Suo integro Dominio, &amp; Jurisdictione complecterctur,</HI> might be circumscribed within the Sphere and Circumference of its own Signiory, without any adherence or Con∣nexion to any other: but it seems the Beams of majesty, not beating with any propitious Influence on this Design, it grew not up to that Stature, and perfecti∣on, it did first aspire to; so that it remained an imperfect Moiety of a Mannor, under which Notion it is represented to us at present. Yet, in the ninth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, <HI>Eleanor</HI> Wife to that Prince, obtained a Market weekly, and a Fair yearly, to be observed at this place, and being improved with these advantageous Fran∣chises, it remained marshalled in the Inventory of the Royal Demeasne, untill the second year of King <HI>James,</HI> and then it was passed away by Grant to <HI>Philip</HI> then Earl of <HI>Mout Gomery,</HI> upon whose late Decease it was disposed by Will to own the Interest of his second Son Mr. <HI>James. Herbert.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cheveney,</HI> and <HI>Cheveney House,</HI> are both within the Verge of <HI>Marden,</HI> and were entituled to a Family of that Sirname. <HI>Henry de Cheveney</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 59. And af∣ter
<PB N="233" REF="124"/>him <HI>Joan</HI> the Wife of <HI>John Cheveney</HI> his Son was in Enjoyment of it at her De∣cease, which was in the thirty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 5. But after this I find no farther Remembrance of this Family at this Place; for in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I discover by an ancient Court-Roll, one <HI>William Atweld</HI> to have held the Propriety of it: And in this Family was the Title lodged until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was transmitted by Sale to <HI>Couper,</HI> and in the thirteenth year of that Monarch, I find one <HI>William Couper,</HI> to have discharged some Persons of some Amerciaments, and Fines imposed upon them for not perform∣ing Suite and Service at this Mannor of <HI>Cheveney:</HI> and in this Family was the Interest successively resident, until the Beginning of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> and then this House and Mannor being by the Custome of Gavelkind ground into two Parcels, and those possest by two Brothers Coheirs, one of them passed away <HI>Cheveney</HI> House to <HI>Ma∣plesden,</HI> in which name it is yet constant, and the other alienated the Mannor of <HI>Che∣veny</HI> to <HI>Lone;</HI> from whom Mr. ....... <HI>Lone</HI> the instant Proprietary is lineally ex∣tracted</P>
<P><HI>Sipherst</HI> is another little Mannor in <HI>Marden,</HI> which had Possessors here of that Sirname, until the latter End of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then they being abolished and the Fee-simple abandoned and surrendred to <HI>William Atweld,</HI> about the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, that Name was entituled to the Estate here, until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was alienated with <HI>Cheveney</HI> to <HI>Couper,</HI> in whom the Fee-simple had not been long constant, when it was demised to <HI>John Field,</HI> and he made his Will in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and gives it to his Son <HI>Jo. Field,</HI> and from him did it by descendant Right devolve to his Suc∣cessor <HI>Edward Field,</HI> who held it the fourth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and after gave it to his Kinsman <HI>Thomas Gilbert,</HI> whose Successor <HI>Thomas Gilbert</HI> having settled it on his Widow <HI>Sibil Gilbert,</HI> it is now in her Right possest by her second Husband Mr. <HI>Richard Knight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tildens Stubbins,</HI> and <HI>Brooke,</HI> are three other inconsiderable Mannors in this Pa∣rish: which had three owners of these Denominations, the first of which were Persons of Eminence in this County, and had an Estate at <HI>Wye. Catts place</HI> in <HI>Brench∣ley</HI> and at <HI>Tilmanston</HI> likewise, as it appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> where there is an Assessement laid upon the Lands of <HI>William Tilden,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight: But to proceed, the Propriety of these three Places, were constantly under the Dominion of these three Families until the latter End of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then <HI>Stubbins</HI> was passed away to <HI>Tilden,</HI> in whom both <HI>Stubbins</HI> and <HI>Tildens</HI> remained combined and wound up together, until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then they were demised to <HI>Thomas Stidolfe</HI> Esquire, and he made his Will in the year 1453, and therein mentions <HI>Stubbins</HI> and <HI>Tildens</HI> to have been purchased of <HI>Tilden</HI> and <HI>Brooke</HI> of <HI>Richard Brooke:</HI> but this Family about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, determining in a Female Inheritrix (matched to <HI>Richard Vane</HI> Esquire) united these three Mannors to his Patrimony, and from him by the traverses of several Descents, are they now come down to be possest by the right Honourable <HI>Mildmay Vane</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmerland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monkton</HI> is a Mannor in <HI>Marden,</HI> which made up the Demeasn of the Priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> and upon the suppression of that Cloister, was by K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury</HI> Esquire, who not long after alienated it to <HI>Thomas Wilfor'd</HI> Esquire, and he in the seventh year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>Thomas Stanley;</HI> in which Family it remained, until our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was demised by Sale to Mr. ...... <HI>Board</HI> of <HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P><HI>St. Mary Church</HI> in <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> lies in the Hundreds of <HI>St. Martins</HI> and <HI>New-Church,</HI> and was anciently folded up in that large Demeasn which did acknowledge the Dominion of the <HI>Criolls; John de Crioll</HI> or <HI>Keriel</HI> of a younger Extraction from <HI>Bertram de Crioll</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and transmitted it to his Son Sir <HI>Nicholas Criol;</HI> from whom by a continued Succession, it devolved to Sir <HI>Thomas Crioll</HI> Knight of the Garter, who falling an Oblation at the Battle of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> to the Cause and Quarrel of the House of <HI>York,</HI> by his Daughter and Heir it came to be the Inheritance of <HI>John Fogge</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="125"/>Esquire, who left it to his Son <HI>Thomas Fogge:</HI> and though he determined in two Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Alice</HI> matched to <HI>William Scot,</HI> and <HI>Anne</HI> first married to <HI>Edward Scot,</HI> and after to <HI>Henry Isham,</HI> yet it seems (to improve and continue the Name) he gave this and other Lands to his Kinsman <HI>George Fogge,</HI> whose Posterity enjoyed it even until our Fathers Memory, and then it was alienated to <HI>Carkeredge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>St. Maries</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> was (as appears by Sir <HI>Thomas Wisemans</HI> Evi∣dences, for I can trace not any Notice of it in Publick Records) in the Raign of <HI>Edw.</HI> the fourth, (for no higher do the Deeds arrive at) in the Hands of one <HI>William Halton,</HI> who sold the same to <HI>William Lemyng</HI> Citizen and Grocer of <HI>London,</HI> as appears by a Deed dated the twenty second day of <HI>October,</HI> in the eighth year of the said King's Raign. Afterwards I find this abovesaid Mannor in the Hands of Sir <HI>John Brooke</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; but from whom it came to him the E∣vidences do not discover: but I find, that in the seventh year of that King's Raign, the said Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> sold the abovesaid Mannor to Sir <HI>Robert Reade,</HI> then Serjeant at Law, but after Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; who concluding in three Daughters and Coheirs; <HI>Dorothy</HI> matched to Sir <HI>Edward Wotten</HI> of <HI>Boughton Mal∣herbe; Katharin</HI> wedded to Sir <HI>Thomas Willoughbie</HI> second Son of <HI>Christopher Willoughbie</HI> Lord <HI>Willoughbie</HI> of <HI>Eresbye;</HI> and <HI>Margaret</HI> married to Sir <HI>Iohn Harcourt</HI> of <HI>Elnal,</HI> in the County of <HI>Stafford,</HI> this Mannor of <HI>St. Maries</HI> in her right, descending to this Family, the abovesaid Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> and the Lady <HI>Margaret</HI> his Wise, did, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, exchange the said Mannor of <HI>St. Mary Hall</HI> with <HI>Iohn Wiseman</HI> Gentleman, for the Priory of <HI>Ronton,</HI> in the County of <HI>Stafford:</HI> since which Time the said Mannor hath continued in the Name of <HI>Wiseman,</HI> and is at this instant in the Possession of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiseman</HI> of <HI>Riven Hall,</HI> in the County of <HI>Essex,</HI> Knight.</P>
<P><HI>Newland</HI> is a Mannor Situated in <HI>St. Maries,</HI> which was, as high as can be traced, by any Track of Evidence, the Inheritance of <HI>Somer,</HI> vulgarly now called <HI>Somers. Richard le Somer</HI> made his Will, as appears by the Records of <HI>Rochester,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1347, and died seised of this Place, Lands in <HI>Halstow, Higham, Leigh,</HI> and else∣where, and from him did it come down by the Channel of Descent to <HI>John Somer,</HI> who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, who was a great Benefactor to the Priory of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> in whose Cloister the Armes of this Fa∣mily remain insculped in Stone as a Memorial of his Beneficence, the last of this Fa∣mily who held this place, was Sir <HI>William Somer,</HI> who was thrice employed as publick Embassador to forraign States by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and he deceased without Issue Male, so that his two Daughters matched to Sir <HI>Alexander Temple,</HI> and Sir <HI>James Cromer</HI> became his Coheirs; but this Mannor of <HI>Newland</HI> upon the Petition was united to the Demeasn of <HI>Temple,</HI> whose Heir hath lately passed it away to the Treasurers of the Chest, for sick and mained Seamen at <HI>Chetham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mershham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> was given by <HI>Siward</HI> and <HI>Mawde</HI> his Wife to the Monks of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> for support of their Diet, which Concession of their's, was afterwards confirmed (as appears by the Book of <HI>Christ-Church</HI>) by the Royal Authority of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and so remained wrapped up in the Demeasn of the Church till the Dissolution of that Covent, and then it fell into the Revenue of the Crown; and King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty third year of his Raign, settled it on the newly erected Dean and Chapter of <HI>Canter∣bury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quatherington</HI> in this Parish, vulgarly called <HI>Quarington,</HI> was the ancient Residence of the <HI>Blechendens,</HI> till <HI>William Blechenden</HI> by marriage with <HI>Agnes</HI> Daughter and Co∣heir of ....... <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Aldington</HI> became in her Right, Master of <HI>Simnells</HI> in that Parish, and so left his Habitation at <HI>Mersham,</HI> to enjoy his new Acquists at <HI>Aldington;</HI> certainly they were very anciently Seated if not at this place, yet in this Parish, for I have seen the draught of a Pedigree knit together by <HI>Clarenceux Cooke,</HI> wherein they are brought down from <HI>Nicholas de Blechenden,</HI> who flourished here at <HI>Mersham</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; though I confesse the Evidences of <HI>Quarington</HI> reach no higher then <HI>Will.

<PB N="235" REF="125"/>the second after the <HI>Blechendens,</HI> the <HI>Cleggates</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> became in our Grand∣fathers Memory, to be Lords of the Fee; but not long after alienated their Right in it to <HI>Eastday</HI> of <HI>Saltwood,</HI> from whom the like Current of Succession w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fted it over to <HI>Knatchbull,</HI> from whom the Right descended to Sir <HI>Norton Knatchbull,</HI> a Person who for his Favour and Love to Learning and Antiquitie, in Times when they are both fallen under such Cheapness and Contempt, cannot be mentioned without an Epithete equivalent to so just a merit.</P>
<P><HI>Mepeham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Totingtrough,</HI> was given to the Monks of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for their supply of Dyet by <HI>Ediva</HI> the Queen, Mother of the two Kings, <HI>Edmund,</HI> and <HI>Eadred,</HI> (as appears by the Book of <HI>Christ-Church</HI>) in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 861. Upon the suppression of that Fraternitie, it increased by its Addition, the Revenue of the Crown; but it was suddenly after in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, restored to the Church, and so continued till these infortunate Times chained it to the Patri∣mony of the See of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> whose Arch-Bishops it seems had a speciall Regard to this place: for <HI>William Courtney</HI> one of them, re-builded the Church, which by the On∣sets of Time was shrunk into Dilapidation and Rubbish, and erected likewise some Alms Houses here for the support and maintainance of the poor of this Parish.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Dodmore</HI> lies within the Circuit of <HI>Mepeham,</HI> and was, as high as the Beam of any Deed can discover to me, the Possession of the noble and Knightly Family of <HI>Huntingfield.</HI> Sir <HI>Peter Huntingfield</HI> by his Deed <HI>sans</HI> Date does demise it to his kinsman <HI>Walter Huntingfield,</HI> and he by Deed likewise without any Date affixed to it passed it away to <HI>John Smith,</HI> and he in the forty seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, conveyed his Right in it by Sale to <HI>Richard Ideleigh,</HI> from whom the <HI>Ideleighs</HI> of <HI>Easture</HI> in <HI>Chilham,</HI> and <HI>Rollingin</HI> at <HI>Goodneston</HI> in <HI>East-Kent</HI> originally branched out. But here the private Muniments of this place, by whose Light I have walked, break off; so that I must make a Gap in my Intelligence, and skip into the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth. In the ninth year of whose Government, I find by the Court-Rolls of this place, one <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> Esq; to be possest of it, from whom about the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth it went away to <HI>Henry Taylor,</HI> afterwards within the Circuit of thirty years; it was the Possession of <HI>John Giffard,</HI> then of <HI>Walter Powre</HI> of <HI>Brench∣ley,</HI> and after him, of <HI>Henry Collins,</HI> who in the year 1604. demised his Interest in it to <HI>Walter Kipping</HI> Gentleman, of <HI>Kippings-Cross</HI> in <HI>Tuydley,</HI> where they were resident before about five hundred year; and now it is made by <HI>Dorothy Kipping</HI> his Daughter and Coheir, part of the Patrimony of my Worthy and Ingenuous Friend <HI>Edward Darrell</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Dean-Court</HI> is likewise Seated within the Verge of <HI>Mepeham:</HI> It was in elder times a Branch of that wide and opulent Estate which was marshal'd under the Signory of <HI>Twitham. Alan de Twitham</HI> is enrolled in the Catalogue of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentle∣men who were with <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Seige of <HI>Acon. Bethram de Twitham</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, after <HI>Alanus de Twi∣tham</HI> died seised of it in the twenty fifth year of the above-said Kings Raign, and his Son <HI>Theobald de Twitham</HI> after him enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the fourth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, as appears by the Escheat Roll of that year, marked with the Number 76. and left <HI>Mawde de Twitham</HI> heir to his large Possessions in this Coun∣ty, who by marrying with <HI>Simon Septuans</HI> of <HI>Checquer</HI> in <HI>Ash</HI> by <HI>Sandwich,</HI> invested him not only in the Signory of <HI>Dean-Court,</HI> but likewise in his other Demeasne which lay dispersed in severall Branches over this County, and he had Issue by her, Sir <HI>William Septuans,</HI> who matched with <HI>Anne</HI> Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>Nicholas Sandwich,</HI> and had Issue by her <HI>John Septuans</HI> Esquire, who likewise wedded <HI>Constance</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Thomas Ellys</HI> of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and had Issue by her <HI>John</HI> his eldest Son, to whom he gave <HI>Hells, Twitham, Chilton, Molands</HI> in <HI>Ash,</HI> and other Lands in <HI>Kent; Thomas</HI> his second Son who had <HI>Dean-Court</HI> in <HI>Mepeham,</HI> and other Lands in this County; and <HI>Gilbert Septuans</HI> his third Son who had his Mannor of <HI>Chequer</HI> in <HI>Ash</HI> above-said, and from them it is sometimes writ <HI>At Chequer,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Harfleet,</HI> for some eminent Service by him performed at a Town of that Name in <HI>Normandy,</HI> (as the private Evi∣dences of this Family do seem to insinuate) under the conduct of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and so Successively by Custome and Prescription, this Name became hereditary to all of
<PB N="236" REF="126"/>the Name of <HI>Septuans,</HI> who were either directly or Collaterally linked in Alliance to this <HI>Gilbert.</HI> And in the Name of <HI>Harfleet alias Septuans,</HI> did the Inheritance of this Mannor of <HI>Dean-Court</HI> sundry Ages reside, till some few years since, it was by one of this Name, alienated to Mr. <HI>Francis Twisden</HI> third Brother to Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> of <HI>Roy∣don</HI>-Hall, Knight and Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Merworth</HI> stands in the Hundred of <HI>Littlefield,</HI> and gave Seat and Sirname to a wor∣thy Family of Gentlemen, whose Ancestor branched out from a Family called St. <HI>Laurence. William de Merworth</HI> is in the Register of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Knights who were embarked with <HI>Richard</HI> the first, at the Seige of <HI>Acon,</HI> upon which it is probable the Crosse Corslets were taken into the paternall Coat of this Family. In the fifteenth year of King <HI>John,</HI> one <HI>Roger,</HI> the Son of <HI>Eustace de Merworth,</HI> brought a <HI>Quare Impedit</HI> against the Prior of <HI>Leeds,</HI> for the Adyouson of the Church of <HI>Merworth; Roger de Merworth</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Merworth,</HI> in the eigh∣teenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. In the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid) John de Merworth</HI> paid respective Aid for a whole Knight's Fee at <HI>Merworth</HI> and <HI>Crombery</HI> in <HI>Hadloe,</HI> which he held of the Earl of <HI>Glo∣cester,</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and an Inquisition taken after this mans Death, for his Mannor of <HI>Merworth,</HI> (though the Inquisition for his Mannor of <HI>Maplescombe</HI> and other Lands, was not taken untill the forty ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third) finds <HI>John Malmains</HI> of <HI>Malmains</HI> in <HI>Pluckley,</HI> to be his Heir, who in the forty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, sells it to <HI>Humphrey Bohun</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> and he about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, con∣veys it to <HI>Nicholas de Brembre</HI> Son of Sir <HI>John de Brembre,</HI> who at the Battle of <HI>Trent,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> relates in his <HI>Titles of Honour pag.</HI> 556. made himself eminent by a sig∣nall encounter with <HI>John de Beaumonour</HI> in the year 1350. And endevouring to support the prerogative of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, in an Age wherin his Crime was, too much Loialty, against the Assaults of some of the Factious and Ambitious Nobility, sunk under the waight of their Hatred and Opposition: and being attainted of High Treason, this in the tenth year of the abovesaid Prince Escheated to the Crown, and the same King in the thirteenth year of his Raign, granted it to <HI>John Hermensthorpe,</HI> who imme∣diately after conveyed it to <HI>Richard Fitzallan,</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell,</HI> Lord Treasurer, and Lord Admirall of <HI>England;</HI> whose Son <HI>Thomas Fitzallan</HI> dying without Issue, <HI>Joan</HI> one of his Sisters and Coheirs matching with <HI>William Beauchampe,</HI> who was created by Writt Baron of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> in the sixteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, knit this Mannor to the Patrimony of that Family, where it continued till <HI>Richard Beauchampe</HI> this mans Son dying without Issue-male, in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, bequea∣thed it to <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, who matched afterward to <HI>Edward Nevill</HI> Baron of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> from whom the Title both of the Barony and <HI>Merworth,</HI> flowed down to his Great Grandchild <HI>Henry Nevill,</HI> who died the twenty ninth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and left this Mannor to <HI>Mary</HI> his Sole Daughter and heir, marri∣ed to Sir <HI>Thomas Fane,</HI> unto whom King <HI>James,</HI> in the first Parliament which he held, Restored, Gave, Granted, and so forth, the Name, Style, Title, Honour and Dig∣nity of Baroness <HI>le Despencer,</HI> and that her Heirs Successively should be Barons <HI>le Desp neer</HI> for ever. She had Issue by Sir <HI>Thomas Fane</HI> of <HI>Badsell</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Fane</HI> eldest Son, Knight of the Bath, whom King <HI>James</HI> in the twenty second year of his Raign, <HI>December</HI> the 29. created Earl of <HI>Westmerland,</HI> and Baron <HI>Burghurst;</HI> being likewise by his Mothers Descent extracted from the female heir of that old Baro∣ny: for <HI>Edw. le Despencer,</HI> who maried <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Heir of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burghurst,</HI> and <HI>Rich. Beauchampe</HI> who married <HI>Isabell</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>De∣spencer,</HI> and his eldest Son Sir <HI>Mildmay Fane,</HI> Knight of the Noble Order of the Bath, now Earl of <HI>Westmerland,</HI> doth not onely enjoy the Concomitant Titles of <HI>Despencer</HI> and <HI>Burghurst</HI> but the Mannor of <HI>Mereworth</HI> likewise, with all the Royalties of it, which were not inferiour to any which hathreceived Honour by its owners, for it is holden in Chivalrie, by an entire Knights Fee; and a Free-warren which was formerly grant∣ed to it, is yet extant, and the Conveniences of a Park, and Conies are not wanting.</P>
<P><HI>Jotes-Court</HI> in this Parish of <HI>Merworth,</HI> had, as appears by severall old Deeds, some without Date, Owners who were written <HI>Jeotes:</HI> and by contraction of the Name, call'd <HI>Jotes,</HI> but before the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, this Family was crumbled
<PB N="237" REF="126"/>away and gone, and then it came to have the same possessors with <HI>Merworth,</HI> as namely, <HI>Fitz-Allan, Beauchampe,</HI> and <HI>Nevill:</HI> the last of which who enjoyed it, was Sir <HI>Tho. Nevil</HI> third Son of <HI>George Nevill</HI> Baron of <HI>Abergavenny,</HI> which Sir <HI>Tho.</HI> was one of the Privy Councel to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and Speaker of the Parliament, and he in the thirty third year of that Prince, conveyed it by Sale to Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI> who in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by the same Fatalitie, passed it away to Sir <HI>Edmund Walsing∣ham</HI> of <HI>Scadbery,</HI> whose great Grandchild Sir <HI>Tho. Walsingham</HI> Knight, hath not ma∣ny years since alienated all his Concernment in it to his Son in Law, Mr. <HI>James Masters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Swanton-Court</HI> is the last place considerable in <HI>Merworth.</HI> It lay couched in that Re∣venue which related to the Knights Hospitalers, untill the publique Dissolution sup∣planted it, and surrendred it to the Crown, and K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth about the thirty second year of his Raign, granted it to Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI> who in the thirty fifth year of that Prince, conveyed it to Sir <HI>Edmund Walsingham</HI> of <HI>Scadbery,</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>Thomas Walsingham</HI> of the same place, hath lately passed away all his Interest here to his Son in Law Mr. <HI>James Masters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Roger de Merworth</HI> obtained a Market weekly, and a Fair yearly to his Mannor of <HI>Merworth,</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears by an old originall pa∣tent in the hands of the Earl of <HI>Westmerland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Middleton</HI> is so called, by Reason it is placed in the middle of the Shire, and gives Name, to the whole Hundred, which is divided, into five Bay∣lywicks, one whereof is called the Bailiwick of <HI>Shepey,</HI> because it comprehends that Island. Antiquity has set a noble Attribute upon it, for in ancient Records it is styled <HI>Regia Villa de Middleton,</HI> and here at <HI>Kemsley</HI> Downe, derived from <HI>Campsley, viz.</HI> the pastures where the Camp was kept. Within the Parish of <HI>Mid∣dleton,</HI> is the very place, where, in the Time of King <HI>Alfred, Hasten</HI> the Dane, that so much infested <HI>France,</HI> arrived, and fortified in such manner as he before had at <HI>Apuldore,</HI> where he erected a Castle, whose Fragments and Reliques are yet visible.</P>
<P>Our ancient Chroniclers inform us, that this Town, was in a good Condition till the Ragin of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor: in whose days, during the Disgust be∣tween him and Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> such as confederated with the Earl at home, burnt the King's House here at <HI>Middleton,</HI> a castellated Pallace beneath the Church, whilst he and his Sons ransack'd and ruin'd many other places upon the Seacoasts, and Skirts of the Shire.</P>
<P>In Times of a latter Date <HI>John de Burgo,</HI> the elder, had a Grant by Patent of the Mannors of <HI>Middleton,</HI> and <HI>Marden,</HI> in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first: and after <HI>Margaret</HI> Queen of <HI>England,</HI> had a Grant by Patent likewise in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; and after her, Queen <HI>Philippa</HI> Wife to <HI>Edward</HI> the third, had probably this Mannor in Dower, for in the nineteenth year of that King's Raign, as appears <HI>Pat. Anno</HI> 19. <HI>part. prima memb.</HI> 26. she grants it for some term of years, to <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> with all the Liber∣ties annexed to it, reserving only some royal Franchises, which were so inherent to the Crown, they could not be separated, for an Annual Rent of 200. <ABBR>lb</ABBR> <HI>per Annum;</HI> after his Time was expired, it reverts to the Crown, and there it re∣mained, for ought I can yet discover, till the English Scepter was put into the Hands of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then he grants the Mannors of <HI>Middleton</HI> and <HI>Marden</HI> for ever to <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> not long since deceased.</P>
<P>There is within the Limitts of this Parish, a Mannor called <HI>Northwood Chaste∣ners,</HI> which Name complies with the situation, for it stands North from the Town in a Wood, where Chest-Nut Trees formerly grew abundantly. <HI>Stephen</HI> the Son of <HI>Jordan de Shepey,</HI> desirous to plant himself out of the Island, in some place not far distant; built here a Mansion-house, moated about,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ez veteri Rot. penes,</HI> Edo. De∣ring, <HI>Mill. &amp; Baro∣nettum de∣functum.</HI></NOTE> and a goodly well-wooded Park, stored with plenty of Deere and wild Bores, and had Licence from the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and religious Men of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> to erect a Free-Chappell, which some old People hereabouts, who remembred it in the declining Age, described to my Father when he visited <HI>Kent,</HI> to be a curious peice of Architecture for Form and Beauty. * <HI>Rog. de Northwood,</HI> is listed in the Inventory of those worthy <HI>Ken∣tish</HI>
<PB N="238" REF="127"/>persons, who were engaged with K. <HI>Ric.</HI> the first, at his Seige of <HI>Acon</HI> in <HI>Palestine.</HI> His Successor was Sir <HI>Rog. de Northwood,</HI> who was ever fast and faithfull to <HI>H.</HI> the third, and having always given himself to a military and martial Profession, conceived it was ig∣nominious to hold his Lands here, by a lazy and unactive Socage Tenure, and therefore in the forty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, changed them from Gavelkind to Knights Service. He dyed in the thirteenth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, and his eldest Son Sir <HI>John Northwood</HI> succeeded both at <HI>Northwood</HI> and at <HI>Shorn</HI> and in the time of <HI>Ed.</HI> the first, together with his eldest son Sir <HI>Jo. de Northwood</HI> was with that K. in his Wars in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at the Seige of <HI>Carlaverock.</HI> The Mannor of <HI>Shorn</HI> holding by this Tenure <HI>viz,</HI> to carry a white Banner forty Days together at their own Charge, when the King should make War in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Sir <HI>Jo. de Northwood,</HI> was called by Writ to sit in Parliament as Baron, the first of <HI>Edw.</HI> the second, and his Son <HI>John de Northwood</HI> was often summoned to sit as Baron in Par∣liament, in the raign of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third. Certainly a numerous Race of worthy Successors were Possessors of this Mannor of <HI>Northwood</HI> some of which lye buryed crosse∣leg'd in <HI>Milton</HI> Church, that had taken upon them to defend the Sepulchre of <HI>Christ,</HI> or otherwise profest themselves for the Wars in the Holy Land. And at last it devolved to <HI>John Northwood,</HI> who (as all things are wound upon a fixed and de∣termined Period) concluded in two Daughters and Coheirs, one married to <HI>Bar∣ley,</HI> of the County of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> the other was matched to Sir <HI>John Nor∣ton</HI> whose Ancestors were derived from one <HI>Nicholas de Norton,</HI> who flourished in King <HI>Stephens</HI> Days, and had much Land about <HI>Norton</HI> and <HI>Feversham,</HI> as appears by the Book of St. <HI>Austins.</HI> This Sir <HI>John Norton</HI>'s Son, for diverse remarkable Services performed in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was knighted by <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Hungary,</HI> then Lady Regent of the Low-countries, for <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, by the Name of Sir <HI>John Norton:</HI> and his Grandchild Sir <HI>Thomas Norton,</HI> some thirty five years since, alienated it to <HI>Manasser Northwood</HI> Esquire, collaterally branched out from the abovesaid <HI>John Northwood,</HI> and his Son Mr. <HI>Robert Northwood,</HI> passed away the Pre∣mises by Sale to Sir <HI>John Tufton,</HI> third Brother to <HI>Nicholas Tufton</HI> Earl of <HI>Tha∣net,</HI> whose second Son Sir <HI>Charles Tufton,</HI> upon the late Decease of his eldest Brother Sir <HI>Benedict</HI> is now entered upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Helmes</HI> or <HI>Holmes</HI> is a Mannor, which is partly situated in <HI>Iwade,</HI> and partly in <HI>Milton,</HI> and had still the same Proptietaries, as namely <HI>Savage</HI> and then <HI>Clifford,</HI> whither for Satisfaction, I referre the Reader: only this I must add, that about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was rent off by Sale and planted in the Re∣venue of <HI>Thompson,</HI> Ancestor to Mr...... <HI>Thompson</HI> of <HI>Royton</HI> Chappel in <HI>Lenham,</HI> who is at this instant in the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P><HI>Kempsley</HI> in this Parish, puts in its Title, to be of Roman extraction, and there is something in the Name, and in the Situation, which does seem to support this originall, nor hath Time with its destructive Impressions so defaced it, but that there are some Reliques yet remaining of a Camp, and other antiquated Fortifications.</P>
<P><HI>Middleton</HI> in the fifteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, had a Market granted by that Prince, to be held there on the Saturday, which continues until this day.</P>
<P><HI>Midley,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Langport,</HI> was parcell of the Inheritance of <HI>Eching∣ham,</HI> of whom more is spoken at <HI>Jacks-court</HI> in <HI>Lidde;</HI> from whom by <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Thomas Echingham,</HI> it devolved to <HI>Walter Blount</HI> Esquire; from him it descended to his Son <HI>Edward Blount</HI> Lord <HI>Montjoy,</HI> who deceasing with∣out Issue, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Sister and Heir entered upon the Possession; and she by matching with <HI>Andrew Windsor,</HI> after created Lord <HI>Windsor</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, swelled the Revenue of that Family, by the Addition of <HI>Midley;</HI> who not long after, passed it away to <HI>Clache,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir it came over to <HI>Stringer;</HI> and he transferred his Right in it by Sale to <HI>Scot;</HI> and <HI>Scot</HI> conveyed the whole Demise to <HI>Godfrey,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>The. Godsrey,</HI> does now possesse the Signory of the Premises.</P>
<P><HI>Milsted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> though an obscure Village in it Self, yet has been anciently eminent for several noble Families which have had their Residence within the Circuit of it. For first, <HI>Hogshaws</HI> gave not only Seat but Sirname likewise to a Family of that Denomination, in whom, when it had for many years continu∣ed,
<PB N="239" REF="127" MS="y"/><HI>Edmund Hogshaw</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Lovell,</HI> and he dyed seised of it, in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Thomas Lovell</HI> was his Heir; after <HI>Lovell, Greaves</HI> by purchase became entituled to the Possession of it; whose Successor <HI>Robert Greaves,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passed it away to <HI>Roger VVake,</HI> and this <HI>Roger VVake,</HI> in the fifteenth year of the said Prince's Government, alienated by Sale his Con∣cernment in it to <HI>Richard Bernard;</HI> who some few years after, devested himself of his Right in it, and sold it to <HI>Adam Henman</HI> of <HI>Lenham,</HI> where after the Title some few years had fixed, he in the twelfth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> conveyed it over to <HI>Amias Thompson,</HI> and he gave it in Dower with his Daughter <HI>Alice Thompson,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Tooke,</HI> from whom in the memory of these Times, it de∣volved by Descent, to his Son Captain <HI>Nicholas Tooke,</HI> who passed it away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Richard Tilden.</HI></P>
<P>Then we have here secondly another place, which in some old Evidences, is represented under the Name of <HI>Nottingham</HI> Court, though now it bears the Name of <HI>Higham.</HI> It was the Residence of a noble Family called <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who were Owners of a large Patrimony in this Track, and their Armes stand yet in old coloured Glasse in <HI>Milsted</HI> Church, <HI>viz. Paly wavee</HI> of four pieces, <HI>Gules</HI> and <HI>Ar∣tent.</HI> The last of which, was <HI>John Nottingham,</HI> who expired in a Daughter and Heir, called <HI>Eleanor Nottingham,</HI> who by matching with <HI>Simon Cheney,</HI> second Son of Sir <HI>Richard Cheney</HI> of <HI>Shurland,</HI> brought this and a large Demeasne with it, to ac∣knowledge the Signiory of that Family, in which Name without any Vicissitude to transplant the Title it is fixed at this day.</P>
<P><HI>Milton Septuans</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Westgate,</HI> was anciently a Parish,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">See more of this Fa∣mily at <HI>Thurnham.</HI></NOTE> and had a Church, appertaining to it, though now by disuse it be languished into decay, and shrunk into so narrow an Estimate, that it has left only an Oratory or little Chappel, which is yet visible to instruct us, what was its former Glory, which certainly was of no inconsiderable Account, when it was the Seat of the elder House of <HI>Septuans,</HI> who made this their Residence. For <HI>VVilliam Septuans,</HI> Son of <HI>William Septuans,</HI> had here is Habitation, when he was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> which was in the fourth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second: but long after this Man, did it not con∣tinue in the Name of <HI>Septuans:</HI> for this Family, as to that Branch of it, which was planted at this place, shrunk into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to Sir <HI>Francis Fogge,</HI> and so this place fell under his Revenue. And from him descended Sir <HI>Will. Fogge;</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>John Fogge</HI> of <HI>Repton</HI> Knight, passed this away to Sir <HI>George Brown</HI> of <HI>Bechworth</HI> Castle; in whom it remained, till this Mans Grand∣child Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> of <HI>Bechworth</HI> aforesaid, partly sold it, and partly gave it in Dower, with his Daughter <HI>Elizabeth Brown,</HI> to Sir <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> of <HI>Charing,</HI> whose eldest Son by this Match, Sir <HI>Thomas Honywood</HI> of <HI>Marks</HI> Hall in <HI>Essex,</HI> is now planted in the Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Moldash</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Felborough,</HI> is a Branch of the Mannor of <HI>Chilham:</HI> but yet there is the Mannor of <HI>Flemings aliàs Bowers,</HI> for so it is styled in Re∣cords and Court-rolls, which deserves our Notice. It was in the year 1019, as an ancient Court-roll, now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Chapman</HI> does inform me, in the Hands of <HI>John de Fleming,</HI> and probably, here it remained diverse years, though I can discover nothing, which may evince the certainty of it; for there is an Intermis∣sion or Gap in the Evidences. In the twenty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, as appears by another ancient Court-roll, it was the Possession of <HI>John Treswenall,</HI> and in this Name it continued till the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was alienated to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile;</HI> in whose Posterity the Title and Demeasne was setled, till our Fathers memory, and then the Fee-simple was sold away to Mr. <HI>Henry Chapman.</HI></P>
<P>Then secondly, there is the Mannor of <HI>Witherling,</HI> who had Owners, who bore that Sirname, and who had certainly the Possession of it, severall Generations, which is manifest from that compliance the Name had with the Mansion, though the Evidence which I have drained from the Deeds and Muniments of this place, reaches
<PB N="240" REF="128"/>no higher then the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth: for in the thirty eighth year of that Prince's Rule, <HI>Joan Witherling</HI> the visible and only apparent Heir of this Family, transmitted her Interest in it by Sale to <HI>William Keneworth,</HI> whose Son <HI>William Kene∣worth</HI> by the like Fatalitie passed it away in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, to <HI>John Moile</HI> of <HI>Buckwell,</HI> Esquire, extracted from the <HI>Moiles</HI> of <HI>Bodmin</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and this <HI>John Moile</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, sold it to <HI>Hamo Vidian,</HI> a Name very ancient in <HI>Moldash,</HI> for here is a Farme which at this Day carries the Name of <HI>Vidian-Forestall</HI> and his Grandchild <HI>William Vidian</HI> at this instant enjoys the Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mongeham,</HI> called for distinction, <HI>Great-Mongeham,</HI> to difference it from an Ham∣let of that Name, styled <HI>Little-Mongeham,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> and was given to the Church by <HI>Eadbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> for a supply both of Diet and Apparell of the Monks of St. <HI>Austins,</HI> (as the Book of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> does insinuate) and, upon the Dissolution of the Covent, and annexing the Demeasn to the Revenue of the Crown, it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty third year of his Raign, granted to the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> who conveyed it in Lease to <HI>John Fropchunt,</HI> from whom by Purchase it was brought over to <HI>Gibs,</HI> and is now the Patrimony and Hereditarie Right of <HI>Crayford,</HI> a Name of deep and Extraction in this Territorie, by Purchase from the above recited Family.</P>
<P>There is a place in this Parish called <HI>Fogs-Court,</HI> which is Register'd in the Inven∣torie of the Mannors of this County; and although the Mansion-House which be∣longs to it, be fallen into so low a degree of Contempt, that it appears now to be litle more than a Caberet or Cottage, yet it calls for some Remembrance, even in this respect, that it was the Patrimony of that noble and Illustrious Family, and is the only Place of this County which I have yet met with, that is adopted into their Sirname, from <HI>Tho.

<P><HI>Great-Barville</HI> partly lying in <HI>Mongeham,</HI> and partly in <HI>Tilmanston,</HI> is the third place considerable in <HI>Mongeham.</HI> It hath been for many Descents, which have made up some Centuries of years, the Possession of <HI>Crayford,</HI> which are written in Deeds of a very high Ascent, <HI>de Barville Magna:</HI> In an old Roll which summs up those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who were with <HI>Richard Nevill</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> at the Battle of <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> (where after a warm and Bloody Debate, the Title of the House of <HI>York</HI> by a glorious Victory was evidently asserted.) There is mention of <HI>William Cray∣ford</HI> Esquire, who afterwards (as some private Evidences inform me, now in the hands of Mr. <HI>Gethins</HI> neer <HI>Burntwood</HI>) was made Bannerett by King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, for his various undertakings and Services performed in several Encounters, which had an Influence upon the Cause and Quarrell of the House of <HI>York,</HI> and bore (as is mani∣fest by his Seal affixed to several Deeds) <HI>Ʋpon a Cheveron, three Eagles heads cresed,</HI> which I mention, to rectifie that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istake which through inadvertency, hath crept into our Visitations of <HI>Kent,</HI> wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he paternall Coat of this Family is represented to have been <HI>Ʋpon a Cheveron, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Falcons heads erased;</HI> and from this eminent Person is Mr. <HI>Wil.

<P><HI>Mongeham</HI> had an an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent Market by prescription on the <HI>Thursday,</HI> and <HI>Bertram de Crioll</HI> had a Grant of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the Charter of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, which was allowed by the Judges Itinerant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and a Fair yearly, by the space of three Dayes, <HI>viz.</HI> the Eve, St. <HI>Luke's</HI> day, and the day after.</P>
<P><HI>Little-Barville</HI> is partly Situated in this Parish, and partly in <HI>Tilmanston.</HI> A Family called <HI>Pix,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Picks,</HI> were for some Centuries of years, invested in the Possession, and contracted this Name, from some Office (as the Successive Tradition of this Family affirms) that they were anciently entrusted with, about the Altar, and the Utensils which related to it, amongst which, the <HI>Pix</HI> was the most consider∣able, as being the Conservatory of the Host; and so <HI>è Pixide nomen elicitum,</HI> from
<PB N="241" REF="128"/>their Care and Custody of the <HI>Pix,</HI> they originally assumed their Sirname: But to proceed; after this Mannor had for so many Descents, acknowledged this Name and Fa∣mily, about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by Sale it came to confess the Signory of <HI>Crayford</HI> of <HI>Great-Barville,</HI> with whose Revenue the Title and Propriety does at this instant continue.</P>
<P><HI>Little-Mongeham</HI> next offers it self up to our consideration: but of that, I shall speak more at <HI>Northbourne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Morston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> gave Seat and Sirname to a Family that fell un∣der that Appellation, as is evident by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> where <HI>John de Morston</HI> is affirmed to have held it, and to have paid an Auxiliary Contribution for it at the making the Black Prince Knight. He was descended from <HI>Bartholomew de Morston,</HI> who is in the list of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen who assisted King <HI>Richard</HI> the first, at the Siege of <HI>Acon;</HI> But before the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, this Family was worn out, and then it fell under the Signory of <HI>Walter Fitz Walter</HI> of <HI>Essex,</HI> who had beenin elder Times summoned frequently by Writ to sit as Baron in Parliament, and from the a∣bovesaid <HI>Walter,</HI> did this Mannor by paternal devolution come down to his Son <HI>Hum∣phrey Fitzwalter,</HI> and he held it at his Death, which was in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth and had Issue <HI>John Fitzwalter,</HI> who about the latter end of the abovesaid Prince, alie∣nated it by Sale to <HI>Cromer,</HI> in which Family the possession was constant and resident, untill the latter end of King <HI>James,</HI> and then Sir <HI>James Cromer</HI> dying without Issue∣male, <HI>Christian</HI> one of his Daughters and Coheirs, by matching with Sir <HI>John Hales</HI> upon the distinction of the Estate into parcells, was united to the Patrimony of that Family, from whom the Right by Descent is now transmitted to the instant Proprie∣tarie Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> his Son and Heir, Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Esthall</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Morston,</HI> which although it be now by the Vicissitude of Time, and the injurious Impressions of Age, shrunk from its elder Beauty, into decay and Neglect; yet in Ages of a higher date, it was adorned with a nobler Char∣acter of Splendor, when it confessed it self to be parcell of the Inheritance of an an∣cient Family called <HI>De la pine,</HI> (so they are written in their old dateless Deeds) and bore for their Arms <HI>Sable, three Pine Apples Or. James De la pine</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the twenty sixth, and part of the twenty seventh years of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty here at <HI>Esthall,</HI> and died possest of it in the thirty seventh year of the abovesaid Prince, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>Thomas De la pine,</HI> who about the be∣ginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, conveyed his Title and Concernment in it to <HI>Thomas St. Leger</HI> Esquire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, who dying without Issue-male, <HI>Joan,</HI> one of his Daughters and Coheirs, by matching with <HI>John Ewias,</HI> linked it to the Demeasn of that Name, and from him did it transmit it self by Descent, to his Son and Heir <HI>Humphrey Ewias,</HI> who was seised of it at his De∣cease, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and from him by a Thread of paternal Succession, was it transported to his Grandchild <HI>William E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ias</HI> in whom the Male-line determined, so that by <HI>Alice</HI> his Daughter and Heir, it came to confess the Signory of <HI>Thomas Hales,</HI> who in the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth by a Fine and re∣covery wherein his Wife was concern'd, passed away the whole De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> whose Son, Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> in the ninth year of Quee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by the same conveyance alienated it to <HI>Gardiner,</HI> where the Title was so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>atile and mutable that it stayed with this Family, but untill the tenth year of the ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>said Princess, and then it was transplanted by Sale into <HI>John Norden,</HI> who in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>dfathers memory demised it to <HI>Pordage,</HI> Predecessor to Mr........ <HI>Pordage</HI> of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ersham,</HI> who is now entitled to the Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mere-Court</HI> is a third place of Account in this Parish, calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from its Situation near the Sea, which our <HI>Saxon</HI> Ancestors called <HI>Mere,</HI> and is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>marily used in that sense, for any wast heap of Waters, as Lakes, and Pools, that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all sides lockt in by the Land, by the <HI>Dutch</HI> to this day. But I cannot find that it ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had any Possessors that extracted their Sirname from hence; for in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find <HI>Arnold de Savage</HI> held it, and so did his Grandchild <HI>Eleanor Savage,</HI> who was matched to <HI>William Clifford,</HI> and he by this Alliance, became invested in the Possession, and in this Family did the Title lie couched, untill the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and
<PB N="242" REF="129"/>then I can track no farther Evidence of their Possession of this place: In the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, I find it to be invested in the Name of <HI>Croft;</HI> and remained tied to the Patrimony of that Family, untill <HI>David Crofts</HI> died in the twenty second year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and left it to <HI>Jo. Croft, Helen</HI> and <HI>Margaret,</HI> his Daughters; and they, upon the death of their Brother, who was an Ideot, becomming Joynt-heirs to this place, in the forty second year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away to Mr. <HI>Stephen Hulks,</HI> who bequeathed it to his Son and Heir Mr. <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>NAtindon</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Bridge, Petham,</HI> and <HI>Whitstaple,</HI> is an obscure Village, not far remote from <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and only calls for some Remembrance in this respect, that the Mannor of <HI>Staplegate</HI> is situated within the Limits of it, which was the Seat of an eminent Family which bore that Sirname, who were Lords not onely of this Place, but of much other Land in <HI>Romney Mersh;</HI> and had certainly this De∣nomination ingrafted originally upon them, because they collected the Kings profits and Customes arising out of the Staple of Wooll, fixed at <HI>Staplegate</HI> in <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The first of this Family whom I find eminent is <HI>Edmund Staplegate,</HI> who paid respective Aid for his Mannor of <HI>Bilsington</HI> and his other Lands in <HI>Kent,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight; and he was Father to <HI>Edmund Staplegate,</HI> who at the Coronation of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, held that signall Contest be∣fore <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> then High Steward at that solemn Inthroniza∣tion, with <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell</HI> about the Office of Chief Butler, as I have be∣fore mentioned in <HI>Bilsington.</HI> But to return to that Discourse from whence this e∣mergent Controversie did divert me, <HI>Edmund Staplegate</HI> in the thirteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, enjoyed this Mannor at his Death: but after his Deeease, the Title was not long liv'd in this Name, for in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, (as appears by the Testimony of ancient Court Rolls) it was in the Possession of <HI>Leichfield,</HI> who was Master of much Land about <HI>Tilmanston</HI> and <HI>Betshanger,</HI> and in the twenty second year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the fourth, it was by <HI>Roger Lichfield</HI> passed away by Sale to <HI>William Haut</HI> Esquire, Father to Sir <HI>William Haut,</HI> in whom the male-line determined, so that by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Daughter and Coheir, it came to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> who about the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, alienated it to <HI>Philip Chowte</HI> Esquire, and from him the like Fate bore off the Title to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> and he about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, disposed of his Right in it to Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> of the <HI>Dungeon,</HI> Ancestor to Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> of the same place, who not many years since, demised the Premises to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>High-Gate;</HI> upon whose late Decease, the Title like a <HI>Pythagorean</HI>-Soul is transmigrated into his Heir.</P>
<P><HI>Nettlested</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Twyford,</HI> was the ancient Seat of the no∣ble and ancient Family of <HI>Pimpe. William de Pimpe,</HI> paid respective Aid, for this Mannor and other Lands, which lay not far distant from this place, which he held by a whole Knights Fee, at the making the Black Prince Knight, the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; <HI>Reginald Pimpe</HI> was his Son and Heir, and served out the Office of high Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> for him, in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in which year he dyed. It is probable that this <HI>William</HI> was knighted, because there is a Tombe, in <HI>Nettlested</HI> Church, with this Inscription affixed to his Tombe-stone: <HI>Hic jacet Domina Margareta de Cobham, quondam Ʋxor Willielmi Pimpe, Militis; quae obiit</HI> 4 <HI>Septembris</HI> 1337. From whence it may be probably collected, that the above recited <HI>William Pimpe,</HI> though he is not mentioned as a Knight in the Register of the Sheriffs, yet afterwards for some exemplary Services by him
<PB N="243" REF="129"/>performed and managed, might be invested with the Order of Knighthood. From this Man in the continued Succession of a direct Line,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">See more of <HI>Pimp</HI> in my Dis∣course of <HI>Sea-wat∣ches.</HI></NOTE> did <HI>Reginald Pimpe</HI> des∣cend, who determined in <HI>Ann Pimpe</HI> who was his Sole Heir, and so this ancient Family which had under a venerable Character of Antiquity, for so many Ages flourished at this place, as the Monuments in the Church, not yet dismantled, do sufficiently evince, was about the latterend of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh extinguished; and <HI>Nettlested</HI> fell under the Patrimony of <HI>John Scott</HI> of <HI>Scotts</HI> Hall from whom <HI>Edw. Scot</HI> Esquire, is lineally extracted; and in Relation to this Alliance, is the instant Proprietary of <HI>Nettlested.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lomewood</HI> is a second place of Account in <HI>Nettlested</HI> it belonged formerly to a Cloister of black Cannons in <HI>Oxford,</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Friswith,</HI> which being suppres∣sed by Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> in the year 1525, when he intended to erect the magni∣ficent Fabrick of the Colledge of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> this Mannor was resigned up to the Crown; and was by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty seventh year of his raign, granted to Sir <HI>Edward Nevill,</HI> who gave it in Martiage with his Daugh∣ter <HI>Katharine Nevill,</HI> espoused to <HI>John Roydon</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Roydon</HI>-Hall, in great <HI>Peckham;</HI> and he determining in <HI>Elizabeth Roydon</HI> his Sole Heir, she by matching with <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esquire, planted it in his Revenue; and from him hath the Interest of Descent transported it along to his Grandchild Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> of <HI>Roy∣don</HI> Hall Knight and Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Newenden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Selbrittenden,</HI> was erected in the place where the old Roman City of <HI>Anderida</HI> was situated, and was called by the Britons <HI>Caer Andred,</HI> very aptly by <HI>Leland,</HI> styled in Latine, <HI>Noviodunum,</HI> from the Saxon, <HI>Nywandun,</HI> in English by Corruption called <HI>Newenden,</HI> which in the original imports as much as The new Hill in the Valley.</P>
<P>This was that Station and City of the Romans mentioned in the Banner of the Count, or Lord Warden of the Saxon Shore, by <HI>Pancerollus</HI> in his Book called <HI>Notitia Provinciarum,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Anderida,</HI> and sometimes written <HI>An∣deridos;</HI> and here was the Castle which the Saxons called <HI>Andreds Ceaster;</HI> and the great Wood, which stretched out in length, from hence into <HI>Hampshire,</HI> 80. miles was named <HI>Andreds-wald,</HI> and by the Britons <HI>Coid Andred,</HI> other reasons are laid down for the Identity of the place, extracted from the Name which the English Saxons gave it, who termed it <HI>Brittenden,</HI> that is, The Britons Vale, from whence the whole Hundred adjoyning is called <HI>Sellbrittenden,</HI> that is, The Britons Woody Vale.</P>
<P>Here for Defence of the Coast, against the Eruptions of Saxon Rovers, the Romans placed the <HI>Prapositus Numeri Abulcorum,</HI> and hither the River of <HI>Lymen,</HI> long fince called <HI>Rother,</HI> was sufficiently Navigable. But soon after the Romans deserted <HI>Brittain,</HI> it shrunk into Decay, being ruined by the English Saxons; and yet a marke of the Losse, is covertly couched, under the Name of the principal Mannor, called <HI>Losenham,</HI> of which something is to be remembred, when we have done with the History of this place, which I have thus abbreviated. <HI>Hengist,</HI> be∣ing fully determined to expell all the Britons out of <HI>Kent,</HI> and thinking it would much conduce to the improvement of his Design, to recruite his Army with Troops of his own Nation, called <HI>Ella</HI> the Founder of the South-Saxon Kingdome, and his three Sons with a strong Power out of <HI>Germanie,</HI> and then gave a sharp Assault against this <HI>Anderida,</HI> but was intercepted at that instant in his Designe, by those vigorous Impressions, which the Britons out of their Ambushments in the Woods then made upon him. In Fine, after many Prejudices and Losses both given and taken: <HI>Hen∣gist</HI> divided his Army, and not onely discomfited the Britons in the adjacent wood but also at the same Time, forced the City by Assault, and became so enflamed with revenge, that nothing but the Extinction of the Inhabitants, by a publick slaughter, and the totall demolishing of the Town, could supersede or allay so great an Animosity. The place lying thus desolate, was shewed (as <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Hunting∣don</HI> reports) many Ages after, to inquisitive Passengers, till in the year 791, King <HI>Offa</HI> gave this and other Lands to the Arch-bishop and Monks of <HI>Canterbury, ad Pascua Porcorum,</HI> for the Pannage of their Hoggs.</P>
<PB N="244" REF="130"/>
<P>In the Time of the Conquerour, the Arch-bishops and Monks of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> held this Mannor of <HI>Newenden;</HI> and it was rated in the extent of it, but at one Sul∣ling, and was an Appendage to <HI>Saltwood,</HI> and in the Patrimony of the Church did the Title of it remain locked up, till the general Dissolution in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was unloosned, and by Act of Parliament fastned to the Revenue of the Crown, where, till these infortunate Times, it did successively continue.</P>
<P><HI>Losenham</HI> in this Parish, was the ancient Seat of the <HI>Auchers,</HI> an eminent and numerous Family; this was both in <HI>Kent, Sussex, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Essex;</HI> where they made <HI>Coppt-Hall</HI> by <HI>Epping,</HI> the Seat and Head of their Barony, and it is ve∣ry probable, they derive this their Name, from <HI>Aucherus</HI> that was Consul or El∣derman of <HI>Kent,</HI> and led the power of the County, wherewith, at <HI>Richborough,</HI> nere <HI>Sandwich,</HI> he foiled and defeated the <HI>Danes,</HI> as <HI>Alfred</HI> of <HI>Beverley</HI> writes. In the Book called <HI>Nova Feoffamenta,</HI> collected in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, it is there recorded that that Prince,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. pipae de Scutagio Walliae An.</HI> 42 <HI>Hen.</HI> 3.</NOTE> gave <HI>William Fitz Aucher,</HI> the fourth part of a Knights Fee in <HI>Essex,</HI> called <HI>Lagfare. Richard Fitz Aucher</HI> his Grandchild, is in the Number of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who were engaged with <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in his Expedition into <HI>Wales,</HI> in the forty second year of his Raign. <HI>Will. Fitz Aucher,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Cam∣dens Bri∣tannia pag.</HI> 307.</NOTE> another of this Family, held the Mannor of <HI>Boseham</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> by Grant from <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and his Rent-service or Acknowledgement, was to pay into the Exchequer (in whose Time he lived) forty pound of tryed and weighted Silver. <HI>Henry Fitz Aucher,</HI> fills up the Roll or Inventory of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who assisted <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at his Seige of <HI>Carlaverok</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his Raign, and for his Service there, was made Knight Banneret. <HI>Peter Aucher</HI> or <HI>Auger</HI> (for so in old Records they are promiscuously written) was Valet to King <HI>Edward</HI> the second (an Office equivalent in its Trust and Dignity, to those we called Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber to our late Kings) and it seems was mistaken for a Knight Templer, in the fourth year of that Prince, because he nourished a spreading Beard (in that Age an emi∣nent Adjunct of that Order): but <HI>Edward</HI> the second rectified this Mistake, and af∣firmed, that his diffused Beard, did not evince he was a Knight Templer, as ap∣pears <HI>Pat.</HI> 14. <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. <HI>parte secunda Memb.</HI> 20. And if it could any way multi∣ply, or improve the Eminence of a Family, that was so deeply rooted in Anti∣quity before, I could tell you, that sundry of this Name and Family, were Con∣servators of the Peace, and concerned in other Comissions, both to levy Taxes, im∣posed by Parliament, and to have Inspection into Sewers, both in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second: but I avoid the recital, lest this Book might swell into too large a Bulk by these curious and unnecessary Disquisitions. It is enough to inform you, that after this Mannor had for many Centuries of years been wrapt up in the Patrimony of this Family, it went away by <HI>Ann</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir of <HI>John Aucher</HI> of <HI>Losenham,</HI> to <HI>Walter Colepeper,</HI> second Son of Sir <HI>John Colepeper,</HI> of <HI>Bayhall</HI> in <HI>Pepenbury;</HI> from which Alliance, Sir <HI>John Colepeper</HI> created Lord <HI>Colepeper</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> by the late K. <HI>Charles,</HI> claims at this instant the Inheri∣tance and Lordship of <HI>Losenham.</HI></P>
<P>There was in this Parish, a House of Carmelite Friers, called so, because they came from <HI>Mount Carmel</HI> in <HI>Palestine,</HI> and was the first Seminary of that Order here in <HI>England,</HI> who, by their Rule were styled, Brothers of <HI>Mary</HI> the blessed Virgin, to whom this Covent was dedicated. It was founded in the year of our Lord, 1241, and in the twenty sixth year of the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, by Sir <HI>Thomas Alcher</HI> or <HI>Fitz Aucher,</HI> for the Name was often promiscuously writ∣ten so, but never <HI>Albuser,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Speed,</HI> have printed it, though, I do not deny, but such a person might be a Benefactor to the Foun∣dation.</P>
<P><HI>Newenham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was parcell of that Demeasn, which related to the Abbey of <HI>Boxley,</HI> and continued united to it, till the Suppression by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was granted by that Prince to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his Government, and he by his unhappy Defection in
<PB N="245" REF="130"/>the first year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> forfeited it to the Crown, where it remained till Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by royal Concession, invested the Possession in her faithfull Ser∣vant <HI>John Astley</HI> Esquire, Master or Conservator of her Jewells, whose Son Sir <HI>Jo. Astley</HI> upon his Decease, bequeathed it to his Nephew Sir <HI>Norton Knatchbull</HI> Knight and Baronet, who is the instant Proprietarie of it.</P>
<P><HI>Champions-Court</HI> is the second place of Account in this Parish: It was in el∣der Times the Mansion and Demeasne of a generous Family, whose Sirname was <HI>Campania,</HI> and was certainly a Family of eminence in elder Times. <HI>Robert de Cam∣pania,</HI> is inserted in the Register of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who accompanied <HI>Richard</HI> the first, to the Seige of <HI>Acon. John de Campania</HI> his Grandchild, obtai∣ned the Grant of a Market to <HI>Newenham</HI> weekly on the <HI>Thursday,</HI> and a Fair yearly to continue the Vigil, the Day of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and the Day after; and was one of those Knights of <HI>Kent,</HI> who was embarked in the Seige of <HI>Carlave∣rock</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in the twenty eighth year of his Raign. In Times of a younger Aspect, the Name by Depravation, and vulgar Use lan∣guished into <HI>Champion;</HI> and so continued, till it expired in Daughters and Coheirs, one of which was <HI>Katharine Champion,</HI> who by matching with <HI>Robert Corbett,</HI> des∣cended from the <HI>Corbetts</HI> of <HI>Morton Corbett,</HI> in the County of <HI>Salop;</HI> upon the Division of <HI>Champions</HI> Estate, united this to his Revenue, where it had not long rested, but the same vicissitude brought this Name to determine in female Coheirs likewise, two of which called <HI>Joan,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> were espoused to <HI>Samuell Slap,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Hart. Samuell Slap</HI> had Issue <HI>Joan Slap,</HI> who dyed childlesse; and so this Mannor was cast into the Possession of <HI>Richard Hart</HI> Son of <HI>Ralph Hart;</HI> the Suc∣cessor of <HI>Richard Hart,</HI> in our Fathers Memory, alienated his Interest in it, to Sir <HI>Henry Spiller,</HI> and he not many years since, conveyed all his Right and Title to it by Sale, to Mr. <HI>Weckerlin,</HI> descended from the <HI>Weckerlins,</HI> a Family of good Ranke and Account in Upper <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>A third place of Note in <HI>Newenham,</HI> is <HI>Sholand,</HI> whih was in the Raign of <HI>H.</HI> the third, as an old datelesse Deed discovers to us the Patrimony of <HI>Adam de Stomynton:</HI> and after this Name went out, the <HI>Bournes</HI> of <HI>Sharsted</HI> in <HI>Dodington,</HI> not far removed from this place, were about the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, possest of this Lordship; from them by purchase the Propriety was carried over to <HI>Chevin,</HI> des∣cended from the <HI>Chevins</HI> of <HI>Chevins-court</HI> in <HI>Marden,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Chevin</HI> of this place, married <HI>Thomasin,</HI> Coheir of <HI>Champion,</HI> of <HI>Champions Court</HI> in this Parish. From <HI>Chevin</HI> the Interest of <HI>Sholand</HI> did descend by Sale to <HI>Maycott;</HI> and from them by the same Fate to <HI>Adye,</HI> a Family of Note and very much Antiquity as to the Name, in this Track, whose Right it had not long acknowledged, but by the same Devolution, the Title was invested in <HI>Steere;</HI> from whom by Purchase it came over to <HI>Sayers</HI> descended from those of <HI>York-shire,</HI> who, in that Age our Fathers lived in, sold his Concernment in it to Mr. <HI>Hugison</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> in whose Heirs the Pro∣priety of this place, is at this instant resident.</P>
<P><HI>Newington-Belhouse,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Folkston,</HI> and was in the Raign of King <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Possession of <HI>Hubert de Burgo</HI> Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> and from him it descended to his Son <HI>John de Burgo,</HI> who in the fifty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, passed it away by Sale to <HI>Thomas de Belhouse,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Newington juxta Hieth.</HI> And probably this may be a Reason, why this Family after they had adopted this Mannor into their own Name, assumed a Coat which had some Affi∣nitie with that of <HI>Hubert de Burgo, videlicet. Or, upon a Bend Gules three Lozinges Argent and Gules,</HI> which I suppose was done to preserve the Memory of him, of whom it was first purchased. But to proceed, Sir <HI>Thomas de Belhouse</HI> great Grandchild of the above-mentioned, paid respective Aid for this Mannor by the Name of <HI>Newington-Bel∣house,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, and died possest of it in the forty eighth year of that Princes Raign from whom a descendant Right brought it down to his Heir <HI>John de Belhouse,</HI> who enjoyed it so nar∣row a space of Time, that it is left upon Record that he died seised of it in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Robert Knevit</HI> a younger Son of Sir <HI>John Knevit</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> who had married the Heir Generall of this Family, was
<PB N="246" REF="131"/>found to be his Heir, and it was this <HI>Robert,</HI> or else probably his Son, who in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, had a Patent of Confirmation of Liberty of Free∣warren to his Lands at <HI>Newington</HI> formerly granted to <HI>Thomas de Belhouse.</HI> After the Line of the <HI>Knevits</HI> was extinguished at this place, which was about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this Mannor devolved to the <HI>Cloptons:</HI> for <HI>Edmund Knevit</HI> of <HI>Stanway∣magna</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> had three Sisters who were Coheirs to him and their Father <HI>Edward Knevit</HI> Esquire; <HI>Thomasin</HI> the eldest was matched to Sir <HI>William Clopton</HI> of <HI>Kentwell</HI> in <HI>Suffolk</HI> for his second Wife; and <HI>Katharine</HI> the second Sister was married to <HI>John Clop∣ton</HI> Esq; eldest Son of the above-said Sir <HI>William;</HI> and <HI>Dorothy</HI> the third, was matched to <HI>Thomas Carnaby:</HI> but these desiring to Contract all their Patrimony within the Verge of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> alienared this Mannor in the twenty seventh year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, with much of their Land in the <HI>Mersh,</HI> to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who being attainted in the thirty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this Mannor escheated to the Crown, and lay couched in its Revenue, untill the first year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and then it was granted to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who in the last year of the above-said Princesse, conveyed it with all its perquisites to <HI>Henry Herdson,</HI> whose Grandchild <HI>Francis Herdson</HI> almost in that Age we entitle to our Fathers Remembrance, alienated it to Mr. <HI>Henry Brockman,</HI> Grandfather to the instant Proprietarie <HI>James Brock∣man</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Sene</HI> and <HI>Bithborough</HI> were two ancient Seats which related to the Knightly Fa∣mily of <HI>Valoigns,</HI> of whom I shall speak more in my Discourse of <HI>Petham,</HI> but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was extinguished, and then one of the two Daughters and Coheirs upon the Distinction of the Estate parcells, brought these two places to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Francis Fogge,</HI> who lies buried Cross-legg'd in <HI>Cheriton</HI>-Church, with the Arms of <HI>Fogge</HI> and <HI>Valoigns</HI> empal'd upon his Tombe; and from him did the Propriety and Title in an uninterupted Channell stream down to <HI>George Fogge</HI> Esquire, who alienated <HI>Sene</HI> in our Grandfathers Memory to <HI>Honywood,</HI> and <HI>Bithborough</HI> to Mr. <HI>Henry Brockman,</HI> who added much to the ancient Building, so that it is now become the Seat of that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Bertrams</HI> in <HI>Newington</HI> is so called because it was parcell of the Estate of <HI>Bertram de Crioll</HI> who died possest of it in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and left it to <HI>Joan</HI> his Heir, espoused to Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> by whose Sole Inheritrix likewise called <HI>Joan,</HI> it was linked to the Demeasn of Sir <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> from whom the Clew of Descent guided it down to Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> who dying in the twelfth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth without any lawfull Issue, or any visible kindred that could pretend a Title to the Estate, it lapsed to the Crown; and <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted it to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> upon whose attainder it being again escheated, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> in the first year of her Rule granted it to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who in the last year of that Princess, passed it away to Mr. <HI>Henry Herdson,</HI> whose grandchild Mr. <HI>Francis Herdson</HI> conveyed it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Henry Brockman,</HI> in whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>James Brockman</HI> the instant Inheritance is fixed.</P>
<P><HI>Blackose</HI> is another little Mannor in <HI>Newington</HI> which as <HI>Sadrach Petit's</HI> Inquest an Authentick Manuscript informs me, was as high as the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Possession of <HI>Nicholas de Morehall,</HI> a Family who were owners of much Land at <HI>Folk∣stone,</HI> and elsewhere in this Track: and in this Name did it continue untill the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was transmitted by Sale to <HI>William Edwy,</HI> who paid a proportionate Aid for it at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in the fourth year of his raign, from whence much of our Land in <HI>Kent</HI> which was rated at the same Time, and upon the same Design, hath assumed the Ap∣pellation of <HI>Blanch</HI>-Lands. After <HI>Edwy</HI> went out, which was in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, it became the Possession of <HI>Wreake,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Wreake,</HI> (as the abovesaid <HI>Sidrach Petit</HI> who lived in that Age instructs me) exchanged it with <HI>Will. Warham</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and continued annexed to the Demeasn of that See, until the great Exchange made by <HI>Tho. Cranmer</HI> in the twenty ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, with that Prince, and then it was made the Demeasn of the Crown; and after some brief abode there, was granted away to <HI>John Honywood</HI> Esquire.</P>

<P><HI>Newchurch</HI> in <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> gives Denomination to the whole Hundred wherein it is situated, and dilates and spreads it self into several places, which call for some Remembrance. The first is <HI>Peckmanston,</HI> which was, as high as the Rayes or Light of any Evidence can direct to a Discovery, the Inheritance of the Lords <HI>Leybourne,</HI> and was annexed to that vast Revenue, which they entituled themselves to, in this County; and so continued, till Sir <HI>Roger de Leybourne,</HI> left this with much other Land, to his Sole Daughter and Heir <HI>Juliana,</HI> married to <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> who dyed in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but without Issue by this Lady, who deceasing likewise not long after, the Crown, upon a Serious and solemne Disquisition, discovering none, that upon the Stock of any collateral Alliance, could pretend to her Estate, seised upon it as an Escheat; and King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, in the eleventh year of his Government, granted it to the Abbey of <HI>Childrens Langley,</HI> amongst whose Revenue it rested, till the Dissolution of that Covent, and after that King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth by roy∣al Donation, planted the Possession, in the thirty fifth year of his Raign, in Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> a Gentleman in those Times, of principal Estimate in this Coun∣ty, and of the Privie Councel to that Prince; from whom, by <HI>Amy</HI> his Daugh∣ter and Coheir, it came suddenly after, to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe,</HI> who in the raign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> sold it to <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Farmer of the Customes to that Princesse, and he bequeathed it to his third Son Sir <HI>Rich. Smith</HI> by whose Daughter and Coheir, the Title and Right of it at this instant, is lodged in Mr. <HI>Barrow</HI> of <HI>Suffolke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Est-Bridge</HI> in this Parish, is a second place which exacts our Remembrance. This with <HI>Honychild</HI> in St. <HI>Maryes</HI> Parish, likewise in <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> did anciently belong part∣ly to the Abby of <HI>Bradsole ailàs St. Radigunds</HI> in <HI>Dover,</HI> and partly to the Knights of St. <HI>Jo.</HI> which upon the general Suppression in the twenty ninnth year of <HI>H.</HI> the eighth of all religious Cloisters and Seminaries, were swallowed up in the Demeasne of the Crown, and lay there, till <HI>E.</HI> the sixth, granted them in Lease to <HI>Cuthbert Vaughan</HI> Esq, who af∣terwards in the fourth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> purchased the Fee-simple of them, of the Crown, and upon his Decease which happened not long after, disposed of <HI>Honychild,</HI> to his Son in Law <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esquire, and <HI>Est-Bridge,</HI>

<P>Thirdly <HI>Silwell</HI> in this Parish, is not to be omitted, it was in elder Generations an Appendage or Limbe, which made up the Body of that plentifull Income, which appertained to the Abbey of <HI>Boxley,</HI> in this County, and upon the Disso∣lution, was (with much other of the Church Demeasn▪ by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth) granted to <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Esquire, after created Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> and one of the Privy Councell to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth. But as though there had been some fatall malediction, which like original Sin did cleave to the Posses∣ssion, he left no Issue-male to enjoy that large Patrimony, he had thus archieved, but concluded in three Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> matched to <HI>William Waller</HI> of <HI>Grome-Bridge, Helen</HI> first married to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury</HI> Esquire, Secondly, to Sir <HI>George Somerset;</HI> and Thirdly, to <HI>Thomas Vane</HI> of <HI>Burston</HI> in <HI>Hun∣ton</HI> Esq; and then <HI>Anne</HI> wedded to <HI>Richard Covert</HI> of <HI>Slaugham</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> Esq; who shared by these matches and alliances, a considerable part of his Inheritance, in which this Man∣nor of <HI>Sylwell</HI> was involved.</P>
<P><HI>Newington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton</HI> has the Addition of <HI>Lucies</HI> prefixed before it, to distinguish it from <HI>Newington,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Street.</HI> It was the Ancient Patrimony of the Noble Family of <HI>Lucy;</HI> the first whom I find amongst Records of deep Antiquity, was extracted out of <HI>Normandy:</HI> within the Precincts of which Province, or upon the Verge and Margent of it, there is a Signory of that Name yet existent. <HI>G. de Lucy</HI> (so he is written in the most authentick Copies of the Battle Abby Roll) entered <HI>England</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. <HI>Fulbert de Lucy,</HI> and in some old Registers written Sir <HI>Fulbert,</HI> changed his Name of <HI>Lucy,</HI> into that of <HI>Dover,</HI> when he was by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror made one of the Assistants
<PB N="248" REF="132"/>to <HI>John de Fiennes,</HI> in the Guard of <HI>Dover-Castle,</HI> having fifteen Knights Fees as∣signed to him in that Track, for the Support of his Dignity and Trust.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Sel∣dens Titles of Honor pag.</HI> 644.</NOTE> <HI>William de Dover</HI> was one of the Magnates or Peers, who was Teste to the Charter of <HI>Maud</HI> the Empresse, whereby she creates <HI>Miles</HI> of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford. Hugh de Dover</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thir∣teenth, and fourteenth years of <HI>Henry</HI> the second. Sir <HI>Richard de Lucy</HI> was Lord chief Justice and Protector of <HI>England,</HI> in the Raign of the above mentioned Prince, of whom I have more largely discoursed at <HI>Lesnes</HI> in <HI>Erith.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ex vete∣ri Rot. pe∣nes Edo.

Geffrey de Lucy</HI> was frequently summoned to sit in Parliament, as Baron, in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as the Rols of Summons, which relate to that King's Time, now preserved in the Tower, sufficiently inform us: This <HI>Geffrey</HI> with his two Brothers, <HI>Aymery</HI> and <HI>Thomas de Lucy,</HI> were engaged with <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at the Seige of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his Raign, and there received the Order of Knighthood. They were Sons to <HI>Geffrey de Lucy,</HI> who was constituted High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 8. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. <HI>Memb.</HI> 4. <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Anthony Lucy,</HI> both of this Family, were frequent∣ly summoned to sit in Parliament, as Barons in the Raign of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third. In the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Geffrey de Lucy</HI> (who held <HI>Lucy's</HI> at his Death, which was in the twentieth year of that Monarch) had a Charter of Free-warren to this Man∣nor, which priviledge was renued and confirmed by <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth to Sir <HI>Walter Lucy,</HI> in the 27. year of his Raign, in which year he dyed, and left his estate here to his Son Sir <HI>Jeffery Lucy,</HI> who with his Sole Daughter and Heir <HI>Mawd Lucy,</HI> transmitted this Mannor to her Husband Sir <HI>William Vaux</HI> of the County of <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> whose Son <HI>Thomas Vaux</HI> alienated it about the twenty seventh year of the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to Sir <HI>Roger Cholmeley</HI> a younger Branch of the <HI>Cholmeleys</HI> of <HI>Cholmeley</HI> in <HI>Cheshire:</HI> from which Family in our Grand-fathers Memory, it was by Sale passed away to <HI>Sead,</HI> and from <HI>Sead</HI> by as quick a vicissitude it came over by purchase to <HI>Osborne,</HI> by whom not many years since it was sold to <HI>Pagitt</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tracies</HI> is a second place in this Parish, which comes within this List; it was in elder Times the Inheritance of a Family of that Appellation. <HI>John de Tracy</HI> was Teste to an old Deed of <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> which I have seen, wherein he demises some Land to <HI>William de Frogenhall,</HI> the Deed is without Date; but by the Anti∣quity of the Character seems to commence from the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third: Whether these <HI>Tracies</HI> were extracted from the <HI>Tracies</HI> of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> or not, I cannot positively determine, because these of <HI>Kent,</HI> bore a different Coat from the other, as appears by all old Ordinaries, <HI>Vid. Argent,</HI> two <HI>Bends</HI> be∣tween nine <HI>Escollops Gules:</HI> After the <HI>Tracies</HI> had left the possession of this place, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; the <HI>Colepepers</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury</HI> were by purchase seised of the Fee-simple of it, but staid not long in the Fruition of it; for in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the <HI>Cliffords</HI> of <HI>Bobbing</HI> Court, not far distant; from whom by Sale in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it fell under the Signory of <HI>Thomas Linacre</HI> Priest.</P>
<P><HI>Frogenhall</HI> in this Parish likewise was a Branch of that wide Demeasne, which lay diffused in this Territory, and did acknowledge it self to be of the possession of the Ancient Family of <HI>Frogenhall,</HI> whose Seat was in <HI>Frogenhall</HI> in <HI>Tenham:</HI> but whether this were the Land which I mentioned to be by Deed transmit∣ted to <HI>William de Frogenhall,</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, by Sir <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> I cannot positively determine, though it was probable it was, and that afterwards, as was usuall in those Times, to perpetuate the Memory of the Possessor, <HI>William de Frogenhall.</HI> fixed his own Name upon it. And in this Family did the Pos∣session continue, till <HI>Thomas Frogenhall</HI> concluded in three Co-heirs, of which <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was one, who matched with <HI>John Northwood</HI> of <HI>Milton,</HI> and so linked it to the Inheritance of that Family, where it had not long remained when a sem∣blable Fatality brought this Family likewise to expire in Daughters and Co-heirs; so that this place came by <HI>Joane,</HI> one of them, to be the Fee-simple of Sir <HI>John Norton,</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="132"/>but was not long resident in this Family; for he, about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, conveyed it to <HI>Thomas Linacre</HI> Priest, above mentioned, who dying in the seventeenth year of the above-recited Prince, gave both <HI>Tracies</HI> and <HI>Frogenhall</HI> for ever to augment the Revenue of <HI>All-souls</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Newington</HI> it self belonged (as an Ancient Manuscript, now in my Custody, informs me) to a Nunnery which was erected here in this Parish, but by whom it was founded or endowed is unknown: only this Manuscript I mentioned before, rehearses a direful Tragedy, which it cites, as is pretended, out of <HI>Thorn</HI> the Chronicler of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> and other old Manuscripts: It was this. Divers of the Nuns being warped with a malitious Desire of Revenge, took the advantage of the Night, and strangled the Lady <HI>Abbesse,</HI> who was the Object of their Fury, and passionate Animosities, in her Bed; and after, to conceal so execrable an Assassination, threw her Body into a Pitt, which afterwards contracted the traditional Appellati∣on of <HI>Nun-pitt;</HI> but this barbarous offence being not long after miraculously dis∣covered (the Manuscript does not intimate how;) King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in whose Time this Tragedy was acted, seised this Mannor into his Hands, and having by Consent of the Church transmitted the Nuns, who were culpable, to the secular power, by Death to make expiation for this Crime; he sent the Guiltless Nuns into <HI>Shepey,</HI> and after filled their Cloister with seven secular Canons: four of which not long after (as if some secret Impiety had lurked in the Wals of the Covent) murdered one of the Fraternity; upon which the King seises this Mannor a∣gain into his Hands, which he had before given back to the support of this new instituted Seminary: two parts of which laying in the Hamlet of <HI>Thetham</HI> by the two guiltlesse Canons, with the approbation of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, were assigned to the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> (though some Writings more Ancient affirm them to be given under the Notion of two Prebendaries to that Covent) by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; and the other five parts of this Mannor, were by the abovesaid <HI>Henry</HI> the third, granted to his Lord Chief Justice, Sir <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> whose Son <HI>Almericus de Lucy,</HI> saies the Manuscript, did in the year 1278. exchange them with the Monks of St. <HI>Augustins.</HI> And thus was this Mannor fastned to the Patrimony of the Church, and so continued, till the General Dissolution in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth dis∣united it, and linked it afterwards to the possession of the Crown, in whose De∣measne till the Death of the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> it lay, ever since the first suppression, involved.</P>
<P>At this Parish of <HI>Newington,</HI> not long since were digged up many <HI>Roman</HI> Urns, not far distant from the high way or common passage, it being agreeable unto <HI>Ro∣man</HI> practice to interre in those places, where their Monuments might be obvious almost to every Eye, Memorials of themselves, and Memento's of Mortality un∣to living Passengers, whom the Epitaphs of great ones were fain to beg to stay and look upon them. Some of these were of a larger, and some again of a nar∣rower Capacity, it being Customary amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> for the Servants and Clients to obtain Repositories for their Remains in Urns of a lesser; for the Masters and Patrons to slumber in Urns of a more wide and spatious Dimension: and many were so curious, that they contrived vast Family-Urns to continue their living Re∣lations, wherein the Ashes of their nearest Kindred and Friends, at least some par∣cels of them might, as in some common Exchequer, be treasured up, that so the Union in Life might be multiplyed and inforced by an amicable Correspondence, even in the place of Sepulture; thus the Ashes of <HI>Domitian</HI> were mingled with those of <HI>Julia,</HI> and those of <HI>Achilles</HI> slept in the same Urn with those of his <HI>Patroclus.</HI> That this Usage or Practice of the <HI>Romans</HI> extracted its pedigree from <HI>Greece</HI> is ma∣nifest: For all Authors that have taken a Prospect of the <HI>Graecian</HI> Rites of Funerals, consent that those of <HI>Megara</HI> shut up the Bones of four or five Persons in the narrow Confines of one Repertory, or Sepulchral-Urn. It is farther observable, that these Urns discovered at <HI>Newington,</HI> were several of them embroidered with particular Inscriptions; one had <HI>Severianus pater</HI> insculped upon it, another was en∣dorsed with <HI>Priscian,</HI> and a third with <HI>Fulvius Linus;</HI> this also was usual amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> not only to superscribe the Names of those whose Remains were lodged within, but likewise sometimes to devote their Dust to those Deities they
<PB N="250" REF="133"/>called Topical Gods, such as were here, <HI>Deus Viterineus, Deus Moguntis, Deus Mounus, Dui Civitatis Brigantum, Camulus Deus Sanctus, Gadunus, &amp;c.</HI> Some∣times they endorsed <HI>D. M.</HI> that is, <HI>Diis Manibns,</HI> and then we often meet with <HI>Patera's,</HI> or Sacrificing Dishes, Lachrymatories, Vessels of Oile, and other Aro∣matical Libations, which Age and a long Date of Time had condensed into the Consistence of Gellies; sometimes again their Urns were placed or situated near some Bound or Land-mark, and then their Ashes inclosed, were consecrated to the peculiar Protection of <HI>Deus Terminus,</HI> and were cloistered in a Repository or Vessel, much in Figure or Resemblance like a <HI>Roman</HI> Urn, but only the Cover was more wide and deep at Top, and this they styled <HI>Arca Finalis.</HI> Besides these at <HI>Newington,</HI> there are many other Examples of such endorsments amongst the <HI>Ro∣mans;</HI> I shall cull out some few, <HI>Marcus Plautius</HI> who slew himself for the Love of his Wife <HI>Orestilla,</HI> who deceased at <HI>Tarentum</HI> in her passage to <HI>Asia,</HI> that so he might accompany her in Death, as he had done in Life, had his Ashes blended to∣gether with hers in one Urn, whilst this Superscription without adorned their ming∣led Dust, <HI>The two Lovers.</HI> Not many years since there was digged up near <HI>Cog∣geshall</HI> in <HI>Essex</HI> an Urn, which offered up to the Spectator's View this Inscription, <HI>Coccilli M.</HI> that is, <HI>Coccilli Manibus.</HI> And not many years before at the <HI>Bath</HI> was re∣presented to publick Inspection, an Urn, with this Endorsment insculped, <HI>Vibia Jucunda An. XXX hîc sepulta;</HI> I could discover more of this Nature; But I return. In these <HI>Newington</HI> Urns, as my Intelligence instructs me, there were traced out many peeces of <HI>Roman</HI> Coin, it being Customary amongst that Nation, not only to inclose Coin or Mony, both of Consulary and Imperial Stamp, by which the Date of their Friends Decease, might be hinted to an Intelligent Observation; but like∣wise Fragments of those Things the Deceased in his Life Time did particularly af∣fect, as namely, Spear Heads, peeces of Darts and Swords, broken Armor, the Cassis or Helmet, Shields, Goblets, Berill Rings, besides a great Number of Gems, with Heads of Gods and Goddesses, and the pourtraiture of several Crea∣tures, fashioned out of Agat and Amber. Now if any will inquire of me, When this Custome of burning the Dead, and after depositing their Dust in Sepulchral Urns, became to be in Use amongst the <HI>Romans?</HI> I confess I am satisfied the Time is incertain, though I dare positively aver, it was originally transported from <HI>Greece,</HI> where it was used though with more formality, long before it was adopted into the Usages of this Nation. For first the <HI>Graecians</HI> burned only the Bodies of those of more eminent Account, but denied it to those who were of baser Allay, or of ob∣scurer Fame; as likewise they did to deceased Infants; to those who were blasted or destroyed with Lightning, because they superstitiously conceived them enemies to the Powers above; to those who had impiously laid violent hands upon them∣selves; and lastly, to those who had by a perfidious Apostasie, declared themselves to be Desertors and Betrayers of their Country. Secondly, they burned only the flesh of the Body, reserving the Bones to be laid up in Chests or Repertories, which they called <HI>Thecae,</HI> which amongst the <HI>Romans</HI> had the Title of <HI>Ossuaria,</HI> bestowed on them. Thirdly, they esteemed it so great an Honor for any person to sleep in his owne Native Countrey, that if he deceased in any Forrain Region, which was in Amity with them, they there, after their Customary Manner burned his Body, and with much Solemnity transported his Reliques to the place of his Nativity, and at every Crosse Way had their appointed Feasts, which were made at the Expence of the Re∣lations and Friends of the Defunct, which they called their <HI>Compitalia.</HI> Lastly, they strewed Flowers on the Urns and Repositories of the Dead, and adorned them with Ribands, as they did the Urn of <HI>Philopaemen;</HI> but they more particularly affe∣cted the strewing of Myrtle, and Amaranthus, on the Ashes of their departed Rela∣tions, as the <HI>Romans</HI> did that of the Rose; yet both of them did concur in the Com∣position of the Funeral Pile, which was furnished and made up of Rosemary, La∣ryx, Yew, Cypresse, and Firre, wherein it is probable were couched some tacit Hints of their surviving Hopes; and in which mysterious Hieroglyphicks, as being Trees which were perpetually verdant, were wrapped up some secret Inferences of a future Resurrection. That this Custome of Burning the Dead did afterwards by an universal Imitation extend and spread it self to other Nations. That the <HI>Druids</HI> and
<PB N="251" REF="133"/>ruling Priests were accustomed to burn their Dead is expressed by <HI>Pomponius:</HI> That they held that practise in <HI>Gaule, Caesar</HI> expresly delivers: That burning the Dead was used in <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> is affirmed by <HI>Gaguinus:</HI> That the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Gothlanders</HI> did frequently commit their Princes and more eminent Persons to the Fire, is de∣livered by <HI>Saxo</HI> and <HI>Olaus:</HI> That this was the old <HI>German</HI> practise, is also asserted by <HI>Tacitus.</HI> And that it was customary amongst the <HI>Danes,</HI> Several Urns, discovered in <HI>Jutland</HI> and <HI>Sleswick</HI> not many years since, do easily evince, which contained not only Bones, but many other Substances in them, as Knives, peeces of Iron, Brass and Wood, and one of <HI>Norway</HI> a Brass guilded Jews-harp. When this Custome of Burning of the Dead languished into Disuse, is incertain; but that it began to va∣nish, upon the Dawning of Christianity, as Vapors and Mists scatter before a Morn∣ing Sun, is without Controversie; but when the Light of it did more vigorously reflect, like a <HI>Meridian</HI> Beam, on all the gloomy Corners and Recesses of Paga∣nism and Infidelity; then this Use of Urn-Burial, was wholly superseded, and found a Tomb it self in the more sober and severer practise of Christianity. And thus much shall be said concerning these Urns digged up at <HI>Newington.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Levenoke</HI> in this Parish ought in the last place to be taken Notice of; but the Deeds being dispersed into the Hands of those who are Strangers both to this County and my Design, I cannot give the Reader that satisfaction in this particular that I aime at. Only thus much I can inform him, that by an old Court Roll in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Staninough</HI> of this Parish, lately deceased, I discovered that in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it was the possessi∣on of <HI>John Beau Fitz;</HI> and it is probable by the Heir General of this Name, it de∣volved to <HI>Arnold</HI> of <HI>Rochester:</HI> and more to fortifie this, some ancient Country people at my being there, did assure me, they had it by Traditional Intelligence from their Predecessors, That that <HI>Knight</HI> purchased it of one <HI>Arnold;</HI> but of that there is no certainty, only this is positive, that about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, that Knight enjoyed it, and in this Name it remained until almost our Memory, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Gouldsmith,</HI> and he alienated it to <HI>Barrow,</HI> whose Descen∣dant having morgaged it to Mr. ...... <HI>Alston</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> he very lately hath trans∣planted all his Right by Sale, into Mr. ........ <HI>Lisle</HI> of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> now de∣ceased.</P>
<P><HI>Nockholt</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Ruxley,</HI> was a Branch which was incorporated into the Revenue of the Lord <HI>Say. William de Say</HI> died possest of it, in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and from this man was it transmitted to his Grand-child <HI>Geffrey Say,</HI> who concluded in a Sole Daughter and Heir, called <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who was married to <HI>William Fiennes</HI> Esquire, and so in her Right was <HI>Nockholt</HI> united to the possession of this Noble Family; from this man was <HI>Richard Fiennes</HI> descended, who enjoyed this Mannor successively from him, and married <HI>Joane</HI> the Sole Female heir of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Dacre</HI> of <HI>Hurstmonceaux</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> who was extracted from <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Dacre,</HI> who was summoned to Parliament by the Title of Lord <HI>Dacre</HI> of <HI>Hurstmonceaux,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and in her Right was this man summoned to Parliament by the Name of <HI>Richard Fiennes</HI> Lord <HI>Dacres,</HI> in the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. And here did both the Barony of <HI>Dacre,</HI> and the Inheritance of <HI>Nockholt</HI> continue, till <HI>Gregory Fiennes</HI> Lord <HI>Dacres</HI> deceased, in the thirty sixth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and left by Testament <HI>Margaret</HI> his Sister matched to <HI>Sampson Lennard</HI> Esquire, he having no Issue, Heir to his large possessi∣ons, amongst which this Mannor was involved; from <HI>Sampson Lennard,</HI> who was created Lord <HI>Dacres,</HI> in the second year of King <HI>James;</HI> it is now come down by Successive Inheritance to be the instant Patrimony of his Grand-child <HI>Francis</HI> Lord <HI>Dacres</HI> the present Baron of <HI>Hurstmonceaux.</HI></P>
<P>There are two other Mannors in this Parish, but of small importance, called <HI>Brampton,</HI> and <HI>Shelleys-court,</HI> or at <HI>Ockholt,</HI> both which had Owners, who engraf∣ted their own Sirname upon them. There is a recital in the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Aide,</HI> of one <HI>John de Brampton,</HI> who held Land at <HI>Nockholt</HI> and <HI>Ditton,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first: From this Family, <HI>Brampton</HI> came by a Female Heir to be the Inheritance of <HI>Petley,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, conveyed it to <HI>Oliver, alias
<PB N="252" REF="134"/>Quintin,</HI> and hath been for almost two Hundred years, as appears by the Eviden∣ces now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Robert Oliver,</HI> of the <HI>Grange</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Ley∣bourn,</HI> in the Tenure and Possession of that Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Shelleys Court,</HI> called in the Evidences likewise at <HI>Ockholt,</HI> was, as high as the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as the originall Deeds now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Rob. Austin</HI> of <HI>Bexley</HI> inform me, the Inheritance of <HI>Shelley,</HI> and remained united to the Possession of that Family, till the Government of Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and then by Sale the whole Demise, was passed away by Sir <HI>John Champneys,</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> by <HI>William Shelley,</HI> the last of this Name at this place; from whom it devolved to his Son Sir <HI>Justinian Champneys,</HI> who left it to his Son Mr. <HI>Richard Champneys</HI> Esquire; and he almost in the Remembrance of that Age we live in, alienated his Concernment in it, to the present Possessor Mr. <HI>Gooday</HI> of <HI>Suf∣folk.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nonington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wingham</HI> and <HI>Eastry,</HI> hath diverse places in it of considerable Repute. The first is <HI>Fredville,</HI> called in old Deeds <HI>Froidville,</HI> from its bleak and eminent Situation. Times of an elder Inscription, represent it to have been the Possession of <HI>Colkin,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Cokin,</HI> who it is probable erected the ancient Fabrick, and brought it into the Shape and Order of an Habitation: this Family was originally extracted from <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where they had a Lane which bore their Name, being called <HI>Colkins</HI> Lane, and likewise had the Inheritance or Propriety of <HI>Worth-gate</HI> in that City. <HI>William Colkin</HI> founded an Hospital neer <HI>Eastbridge,</HI> which celebrated his Name to Posterity, and was called <HI>Colkin</HI>'s Hos∣pital, he flourished in the Time of K. <HI>John,</HI> and was a liberal Benefactor to the Hospitals of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> St. <HI>Katharine,</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Eastbridge</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as is recorded by Mr. <HI>William Somner,</HI> in his Survey of that City <HI>Page</HI> 116. But to proceed: <HI>John Colkin</HI> dyed possest of <HI>Fredvill</HI> the tenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and in his Posterity was the Title resident, untill the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Thomas Charleton;</HI> and he by a Fine, levyed the second of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, transplants his Interest into <HI>John Quadring,</HI> in whose Name it made its aboad, untill <HI>Joan Quadring,</HI> the Heir General of <HI>Thomas Quadring,</HI> this man's Successor, carried the Title along with her to her Husband <HI>Richard Dryland;</HI> and he about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, alienated it to <HI>John Nethersole;</HI> who by Fine levyed in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, con∣veyed it to <HI>William Bois</HI> Esquire, descended from <HI>I. de Bosco</HI> or <HI>de Bois,</HI> so writ∣ten in some old Copies of the Battle Abby Roll, and in others <HI>R. de Bosco</HI> or <HI>de Bois,</HI> who entered into <HI>England</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, which <HI>William</HI> had Issue <HI>Thomas Bois,</HI> who dying in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, left two Sons: to <HI>Thomas</HI> his eldest he devised <HI>Fredville,</HI> with his Estate there; to <HI>William</HI> his youngest, <HI>Bonington,</HI> and the Lands annexed to it: so that the eldest had the Fai∣rest, and the youngest the ancient Seat: from <HI>Fredville</HI> are streamed out first the <HI>Boois's</HI> of <HI>Hode,</HI> the second Branch of the eldest House; Secondly those of <HI>Betshan∣ger;</HI> Thirdly <HI>Bois</HI> of <HI>Sandwich</HI> issued out from those of <HI>Betshanger.</HI> From <HI>Boning∣ton</HI> are extracted the <HI>Bois's</HI> of <HI>Willsborough,</HI> being the second Branch of the second House; Secondly <HI>Bois</HI> of <HI>Offington,</HI> and thirdly <HI>Bois</HI> of <HI>Hawkherst:</HI> From <HI>Thomas Bois</HI> above-mentioned is the Title of <HI>Fredville</HI> in a successive Line now devolved to his Successor <HI>Iohn Bois</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Elmington</HI> is a second place of Note in this Parish. It was made eminent in former Times, by being parcell of the Patrimony of <HI>Condye</HI> of <HI>Condies</HI> Hall in <HI>VVitstaple,</HI> who likewise had some Interest in <HI>Fredville</HI> by purchase from <HI>Colkin,</HI> which <HI>VVilliam Condy</HI> passed away to <HI>Thomas Charlton</HI> above-mentioned. Which <HI>VVilliam</HI> was Son and Heir to <HI>Iohn de Condy,</HI> who dyed possest of <HI>Elmington</HI> the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> in the forty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and by descendant Right was invested in the Propriety of this place, but enjoyed it not long: for he dying without Issue, <HI>Robert Grubbe,</HI> who had married <HI>Margaret</HI> Sister and Co∣heir of the abovesaid <HI>VVilliam,</HI> entered upon the Possession. But he likewise con∣cluding in two Daughters and Coheirs: <HI>Agnes</HI> one of them by matching with <HI>Iohn Isaack</HI> annexed this to his Inheritance, and his Successor <HI>James Isaack,</HI> about
<PB N="253" REF="134"/>the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, conveyed it to <HI>George Guldford</HI> Esquire, who not long after transmitted the Interest, he had in this place by Sale to <HI>Betenham;</HI> in whom, the Possession was but of a frail and narrow Continuance, for from this Family, a Vicissitude like the former, about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, carried it away to Sir <HI>Christopher Hales,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> not long after, demised it to <HI>VVilliam Bois</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to <HI>Jo. Bois</HI> of <HI>Fredville</HI> Esquire, who now holds the instant Signiory of it.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Albans</HI> is a third place in <HI>Nonington,</HI> which exacts our Notice: It is called so, because it was wrapped up in the Revenue of the Abby of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> and did partake of the like priviledges as that Monastery enjoyed; a Scale of which you may read of, recorded in the late printed <HI>Monasticum Anglicanum,</HI> too tedious here to recapitulate: It was in elder Times called <HI>Esole,</HI> and was held by one <HI>Edmund de Akcholt,</HI> in Knights Service, whose Arms in <HI>Nonington</HI> Church, <HI>videlicet, Quarterly Argent and Azure, over all a Bend componee, Or, and Gules,</HI> are yet visible and obvious: This Mannor upon the general Dissolution, in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, being found involved in the Patrimony of the above said Abby, was in the thirty second year of that Prince, granted with all its Appendages to Sir <HI>Christopher Hales,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>James Hales,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, conveyed it to <HI>John Sticker,</HI> who in the fifth year of that Prince alienated it to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgbery,</HI> from whom not long after the same mutation trans∣planted it into Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> and he demised the propriety of it by Sale to <HI>Thomas Hamon</HI> Esquire, Auncestor to <HI>Anthony Hamon</HI> Esquire, who now enjoys the present Signory of it.</P>
<P>At the Borough of <HI>Wolwich</HI> in this Parish is a place called <HI>Oxendens,</HI> which was the Original Seminary and Fountain of those of that Name and Family in this County.</P>
<P><HI>Ratling</HI> is another place in <HI>Nonington</HI> of principal Note: It contributed in Times of a more Venerable Date both Seat and Sirname to a Family of that Appellation. It would be too tedious and voluminous a Digression to recite all those whom Anci∣ent Records represent to be the possessors of this Place; I shall only take notice of <HI>Sayer de Ratling,</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Robert de Ratling,</HI> who was the last of the Name who enjoyed it, and had it in Possession at his Decease, which was in the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and left <HI>Joane</HI> his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>John Spicer,</HI> from whom the <HI>Spicers</HI> who were Owners of the Mannor of <HI>Sherford</HI> in <HI>Monks Horton</HI> in this County, were collaterally extracted: but it appears they were of no long residence at this Place; for this Man and his Name together went out in Co-heirs; so that <HI>Ratling</HI> fell under the Dominion of a new Proprietary, for by <HI>Cicely</HI> one of them it was knit to the Demeasne of her Husband <HI>John Izaack</HI> of <HI>Blackmanbery</HI> in <HI>Bredge,</HI> and by this Alliance the Title became tied to this Family, till <HI>Edward Izaack</HI> this mans Grand-child, in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, by Sale collated his Right in it on Sir <HI>John Phineux,</HI> whose Successor in the next Age after, alienated it to <HI>Nevinson;</HI> from whom not so many years are yet elapsed, but that almost our Memory may attaque the time of the Sale. By the same Fatality, the Possession and Title was rowled into the enjoyment of the present Owner Sir <HI>William Cowper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oldcourt</HI> is a third place which may exact our Account, it was anciently parcel of the Demeasne of a good old Family, who derived their Sirname from the Parish of <HI>Goodneston,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Gonston,</HI> by no far Distance removed from this place, and continued in an uninterrupted Series, from <HI>John, William,</HI> and <HI>Robert de God∣neston,</HI> of whom there is frequent mention in private Evidences, and who flourished in the Raigns of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as their Dateless Deeds do intimate, until the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, possest of this place, and then it went by <HI>Edith</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Edward Godneston,</HI> in whom the Name was entombed to <HI>Vincent Engham,</HI> descended from the <HI>Enghams</HI> or <HI>Edinghams</HI> of <HI>Wood∣church,</HI> from whom it went away by Sale to <HI>John Sydley</HI> Esquire, Auditor to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, who added much to the Splendor and Magnificence of the <HI>Sydleys</HI> of <HI>Southfleet,</HI> by those additional improvements, with which he encreased the Patri∣mony of that Family. When this Name went out, the next Family which succeeded in the possession of this place by purchase, was <HI>Wild</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> descended ori∣ginally
<PB N="254" REF="135"/>from the <HI>Wilds</HI> of the County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> where they are entituled to an Extraction of deep Antiquity, whose Successor Sir <HI>John Wild</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in that Age we call our Fathers, passed away his Right in <HI>Oldcourt</HI> to <HI>Mersh,</HI> who holds the instant Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Northbourne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> was given to <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by <HI>Eadbald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> (as the Records of that Church do assert) after his Return to the Christian Faith; for formerly by an open Desertion or Apostacy, he had re∣nounced those Principles of Religion, which originally had been infused into him. And being thus cast into the Revenue of the Church, it remained incorporated in its Patrimony, till the publique Dissolution made by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, dissevered it, and laid it up in the Lap of the Royal Demeasne, where it continued couched till Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> first granted it in Lease for Life, to her Foster-brother <HI>Saunders,</HI> so he was styled, because his Mother had been her Nurse, upon whose Decease it reverts to the Crown▪ and King <HI>James</HI> upon his first Ascending the English Throne, granted the Demeasne to Sir <HI>Edwin Sandys,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Man∣nor was sold the 1630. to Mr. <HI>Edw. Bois,</HI> Fa∣ther to <HI>Jo. Bois</HI> of <HI>Betshan∣ger</HI> Esq;</NOTE> a Person who had performed some ex∣emplary Service for him upon his first admission to the Scepter of this Nation, which obliged him to this Concession, from whom it is now by Descent transferred to his Grand-child, Son to Colonel <HI>Sandys,</HI> who in the late intestine Contests between the King and his two Houses, received a mortal wound in a vigorous encounter be∣twixt him and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at <HI>Worcester,</HI> of which some time after he languished away, and deceased.</P>
<P>There was when <HI>Leland</HI> made his Survey of <HI>Kent,</HI> which was in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, the Reliques of an old Stone-house, which the Tradition of that Age did affirm to have been the Pallace of the above mentioned <HI>Eadbald.</HI> And there was, not many years before the same Author made this perambulation, as he in the same Manuscript does assert, a Wall broken down, by which Hole or Inlet was discovered a little Cell or Chamber into which it opened, where were found the Fragmentary Remains of two Children, who had in that gloomy Repository been (as was then conjectured) for many preceding Ages been mured up; and, which did improve the wonder, in one of these obsolete <HI>Skeletons</HI> was descried a stiff Pin of Latine.</P>
<P><HI>Tikenhurst</HI> in this Parish, now by Corruption of the first Etymology called <HI>Tick∣nes,</HI> in elder Times was the Revenue of a Family known by that Sirname; some of whom are Witnesses to Deeds of a very high Date, now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Richard Fogge</HI> of <HI>Dane-court</HI> in <HI>Tilmanston.</HI> After this Family which had left its Name ingrafted upon this place was worn out, which was before the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little <HI>Mongcham</HI> was given by King <HI>Edbert</HI> un∣der the Notion of 6 Plough∣ed Lands to the Ab∣by of St. <HI>Austins.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Stoddards,</HI> from whom the <HI>Stoddards</HI> of <HI>Modingham</HI> near <HI>Eltham,</HI> were originally extracted, became Possessors of the Fee, and in the Patrimony of this Family was the Title of this Place for several Generations involved, till in our Grand-fathers Memory, it was by Sale transplanted into the Propriety of <HI>Peyton</HI> of <HI>Knowlton,</HI> so that it is in Right of that Purchase now incorporated into the Income of Sir <HI>Thomas Peyton</HI> Baronet, who is the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Northfleet</HI> was alwaies a Branch of that Revenue which fell under the Spiritual Signory of <HI>Christ-church.</HI> By the Pages of Doomes-day Book, we may take a brief Prospect of what it was in the Time of the Conqueror. <HI>Northfleet</HI> (saies that Re∣cord) <HI>in T. E. R. se defendebat pro VI. Sullingis, &amp; nunc pro V. &amp; est manerium appre∣tiatum XX. &amp; VII.</HI> <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> That is, <HI>Northfleet</HI> in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, did defend it self for six Sullings or Ploughed Lands; but now, that is in the Time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, only for five, and upon the appraisment was rated at twenty seven pound; and thus did it continue riveted by the Charters of several Prin∣ces, which had confirmed the Patrimony of <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> into the Estate of the Church, till that Whitlwind which arose in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, threw it into the common Dissolution, and then by publique Authority it was uni∣ted to the Revenue of the Crown, and there was fixed, till the year One thousand six hundred and eight, and then the Title was torn off.</P>
<P><HI>Ifeild, Well, Cosington,</HI> and <HI>Shinglewell,</HI> are four small Mannors which are circum∣scribed within the Limits of this Parish. They were in Ages of a more venerable
<PB N="255" REF="135"/>Aspect, the Patrimony of <HI>Hever</HI> of <HI>Hever: William de Hever</HI> had a Charter of Free-warren granted to his Lands at <HI>Ifield,</HI> and <HI>Shinglewell,</HI> and other Lands in <HI>Northfleet,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, which was renued to <HI>Thomas de Hever,</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but he left no Heits male, to en∣joy this priviledge; for he and his Name expired in Females, whereof <HI>Joan</HI> one of his Coheirs, was espoused to <HI>Reginald Cobham,</HI> who was summoned to Parlia∣ment by Writt as Baron of <HI>Sterborough,</HI> in the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and the other was matched to <HI>Iohn Brocas,</HI> but his Estate at these above∣mentioned places, was upon the Partition annexed to the Patrimony of the Lord <HI>Cobham;</HI> from which Family about the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, it came over to <HI>Iohn Rykeld,</HI> who with his Son <HI>William Rykeld,</HI> lyes entombed in <HI>Northfleet</HI> Church: but it seems this last mentioned <HI>William,</HI> deceased without Issue-male, for <HI>Rose</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, was married to <HI>Edward Limsey,</HI> descended from <HI>Ralph de Limsey,</HI> who held the Mannor of <HI>Budbrook</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire,</HI> the twentieth of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, as is testified by <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and this Man had Issue <HI>Iohn Limsey,</HI> to whom <HI>Ifield Shinglewell,</HI> and the other two places in right of his Mo∣ther, did successively devolve. But it seems the Title of <HI>Wells, Cosington,</HI> and <HI>Ifield,</HI> did not long dwell in <HI>Iohn Limsey;</HI> for in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, he alienated them to <HI>Iohn Young;</HI> from which Family in the middle of the raign of <HI>H.</HI> the eighth, they came back again to acknowledge the Signiory of <HI>Limsey,</HI> in whom again the Possession was as transitory as formerly; for before the latter end of <HI>H.</HI> eighth, they were conveyed to <HI>Rainsford,</HI> from whom, about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> they were by Sale passed away to Alderman <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and in this Family was the Inheritance lodged, untill allmost those Times which fell under the Cognisance of our Remembrance, and then they were disposed of, by Sale, to <HI>Child.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Derndale</HI> is another ancient Seat in <HI>Northfleet,</HI> which in old Evidences, some of which are not bounded with any date, is styled <HI>Derendale,</HI> as having in elder Times (as it appears by old Deeds) Possessors of that Name; and when they had deser∣ted the Possession, which was before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it be∣came the Inheritance of <HI>William Wangford,</HI> whose Son <HI>William Wangford,</HI> was Ser∣jeant at Law, and a great Benefactor to <HI>Rochester</HI> Bridge; and he being his Heir to this place, in the fifteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, passed it away to <HI>John</HI> and <HI>William Flucke;</HI> from whom suddenly after it came over by purchase to <HI>Iohn Rouse,</HI> descended from <HI>William Rouse</HI> of <HI>Birling,</HI> whose Son <HI>Iohn Rouse,</HI> demised Land in <HI>Northfleet,</HI> as appears by an old Deed, to <HI>Iohn Rouse,</HI> in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and this above-mentioned <HI>Iohn Rouse,</HI> in the tenth year of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the fourth, demised his Right in this place to <HI>Thomas Wombwell,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Clifton</HI> Esquire, and this <HI>Iohn Clifton,</HI> dying without Issue, in the year 1471, be∣queaths his Interest in it by Will to <HI>Thomas VVombwell,</HI> and he because he was originally extracted, from a place in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> called <HI>Wombwell,</HI> erected a House here, which he adopted into his own Name, and styled it <HI>Wombwell</HI> Hall, which with <HI>Dernedale</HI> remained involved in the Possession of this Family, untill some few years the Title was by Sale transplanted into Mr. ......... <HI>Adye</HI> Esquire, Counsellor at Law, Son and Heir, to Mr. ........ <HI>Adye</HI> of <HI>Doding∣ton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shinglewell</HI> is another place in <HI>Northfleet</HI> which may deservedly be taken Notice of, because <HI>Hever</HI> is situated within the precincts of it, which was the Seminary or Seedplot of the ancient Family of <HI>Hever,</HI> and though <HI>Hever</HI> Castle by rea∣son of its <HI>Grandeur</HI> and Magnificence, was their capitall Mansion, yet this was the original Fountain or Cradle, from whence the Family primitively issued forth. <HI>W. de Hever</HI> was a person of note, and was engaged with <HI>R.</HI> the first at the Seige of <HI>Acon.</HI> In the seventh year of the raign of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> as appears by the Pipe-rolls of that Time, <HI>Hugh de Hever,</HI> and <HI>Walter de Hever,</HI> were <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae,</HI> a place if we calculate it for the Meridian of those Times, of a very great Latitude of Power, Trust, and Concernment; for they were looked upon in all Causes either of Criminal or Civill Aspect, as the representative Body of the County; and from them it is possible our present Grand Juries, may seem to extract their first
<PB N="256" REF="136"/>Institution. <HI>Richard de Hever</HI> is found in the <HI>Kentish</HI> Register of those, who ac∣companied <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in the nineteenth year of his raign to <HI>New Castle,</HI> where he summoned the Pretenders to the <HI>Scottish</HI> Scepter, to give an Account of the Justice of their Title to that Diadem. <HI>Thomas de Hever</HI> obtained a Market to <HI>Shinglewell,</HI> and two Fairs, one at <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> which was to continue five Dayes, and the second at the Feast of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> which was to continue three, as ap∣pears, <HI>Chart.</HI> 4. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. <HI>Num.</HI> 9. After this Family was worn out, the <HI>Cobhams</HI> by a Right derived from <HI>Reginald de Cobham,</HI> who married <HI>Joane,</HI> one of the Co∣heirs of <HI>William de Hever,</HI> were invested in the Fee, and from them it passed away by Sale, about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, to <HI>Rykeld,</HI> where the Possession was of no long Date; for <HI>Rose</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>John Rykeld,</HI> by matching with <HI>John Limsey,</HI> united this Mannor of <HI>Hever</HI> to his Patrimony, and in this Name was the Title re∣sident, until the midst of the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Rainsford,</HI> and from this Name the like Devolution, about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> carried it away to <HI>Garth,</HI> who almost in our Fathers Memory conveyed it by Sale to Mr. ...... <HI>Child,</HI> from whom it is lately come over by pur∣chase to be the Inheritance of Mr. ...... <HI>Fortree,</HI> of <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Norton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was, as high as I can track, the Inheritance of that Family, whose Sirname was <HI>de Campania,</HI> and whose Principal Seat was at <HI>Champions Court</HI> in <HI>Newenham. John de Campania</HI> had a Charter of Free-warren, granted by Royal Indulgence to his Mannor of <HI>Norton,</HI> in the thirty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and when this Name had deserted the Possession, the Title of this place came to own the Signory of <HI>John Boteler</HI> of <HI>Graveney</HI> Esquire, who flourished in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; but, it is manifest, was not very stable in this Name; for, by <HI>Boteler</HI> this mans Sole Heir, it was incorporated into the Patrimony of <HI>John Martin,</HI> her Husband, afterwards Judge of the Common Pleas; and in this Family was it resident, till the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was conveyed away by Sale to <HI>Finch,</HI> issued out from the <HI>Finches</HI> of <HI>Groveherst</HI> in <HI>Milton.</HI> But the same Fatality which brought it over to <HI>Martin,</HI> carried it away from the Name of <HI>Finch:</HI> for this Family in our Grand-fathers Memory determining in a Daughter and Heir, she by matching with <HI>Sonds</HI> of <HI>Sonds</HI> Place at <HI>Darking</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> linked <HI>Norton</HI> to the Demeasne of that Family; where, after the Possession had some Time been lodged, it went away by Sale, about the latter end of the raign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Thomas Mills</HI> Esquire, who upon his Decease, which was in the entrance of the raign of King <HI>Charles,</HI> by some Addition of Estate still to support the Name, and improve the Luster of the Family, gave it to his Cozen <HI>Mills</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> who in Right of that Testamentary Donation is the instant Possessor of <HI>Norton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Provenders</HI> is an Ancient Seat in this Parish; once the Mansion of a Family of that Sirname, which though it be long since worn out at this place, yet it is still (under a Character of no despicable Account) in being, in <HI>Wiltshire;</HI> where for several Ages last past they have successively setled. I have seen a Deed without Date, which about the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, fixes the possession of this place in <HI>John de Provender,</HI> and this agrees with <HI>Sidrach Petits</HI> Inquisition, who in his curious Survey of several <HI>Kentish</HI> Mannors, taken in the twenty eighth year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, re∣presents this place about the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, to be in the Tenure of the above-said <HI>John de Provender.</HI> After the <HI>Provenders,</HI> the <HI>Quadrins</HI> were Possessors, and then successively the <HI>Goldwells</HI> of <HI>Goldwell,</HI> which was in the raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, were Proprietaties of <HI>Provenders,</HI> and remained many years invested in the Signory of it, till the common Devolution of Purchase translated the right of it to <HI>Dry∣land,</HI> a Family of much Splendor, and no lesse Estate in this Track: one of which Name, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passed away his Interest in it by Sale to <HI>Robert Atwater</HI> Esquire, Justice of Peace of this County in that Age, and he trans∣mitted it by Sale to Sir <HI>James Hales,</HI> Son of Sir <HI>John Hales,</HI> from which Family, in the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it went over by Sale to <HI>Sayer,</HI> in which Family, af∣ter the Propriety some few years had rested, it was almost within the Limits of our Remembrance, sold to Mr. <HI>Hugison</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> in Right of which Purchase, after the Decease of her Mother, it is to devolve to Mrs. <HI>Jane Hugison,</HI> descen∣ded

<P><HI>Nutsted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> was in elder Times couched in the Patrimony of a Family called <HI>Gravesend,</HI> which was of no cheap or obscure Account in this Track; for Sir <HI>Stephen de Gravesend</HI> is in the Register or Inventory of those Knights which accompanied <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in his prosperous Expedition into <HI>Scotland,</HI> when by a succesful Reduction, he in the twenty eighth year of his faign subdued the strong Fortress of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland. Richard de Gravesend,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> the more to improve the <HI>Grandeur</HI> of <HI>Nursted,</HI> which then was entituled to his Name and Family, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to this Mannor, in the twenty seventh year of the above-said Prince. In the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Thomas de Gravesend</HI> died, concerned in an Estate here at <HI>Nutsted,</HI> as appears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 63. <HI>parte secunda.</HI> But not all the Mannor, for in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, Sir <HI>John de Beaumont</HI> paid respective Aide for Lands which he held at <HI>Nutsted,</HI> as appears by the Record, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. But both these Families, before the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, were dislodged from the possession of this place, and then I find it cast into the Re∣venue of a Family called <HI>Middleton,</HI> who were not long Lords of the Fee: for in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Thomas Frowick</HI> Esquire, and he by a Fine levied, in the thirty eighth year of that Prince, conveyed it to <HI>Hugh Brent,</HI> in which Name it was resident, until the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was alienated to <HI>Martin;</HI> but <HI>William Martin</HI> great Grand-child of <HI>John Martin</HI> the Judge, dying without Issue-male, <HI>Margaret</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir linked it unto the Demeasne of her Husband Mr. <HI>John Rogers,</HI> in which Family, after it had resided, until that Age which was encircled in our Fathers Remem∣brance, it was passed away by Sale to <HI>Sidley,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Sidley</HI> of St. <HI>Cleres</HI> Knight and Baronet, not many years since by the same Vicissitude conveyed it to <HI>John Adye</HI> of <HI>Dodington</HI> Esquire.</P>

<P><HI>OFham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkefeild,</HI> was Anciently divided between two Families <HI>Corton</HI> and <HI>Ditton: Richard de Corton</HI> held half a Knights Fee at this place, and paid respective Aide for it at making the Black Prince Knight, as ap∣pears by the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Aide,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Ralph de Ditton</HI> paid an auxiliary Contribution for the other Moity, which likewise was held by half a Knights Fee, at the Investiture above-said; but long it continued not to confess the Signory of these two Families: for <HI>Codwell</HI> which was part of the Man∣nor of <HI>Offham,</HI> was alienated by <HI>Richard de Corton</HI> to <HI>Thomas de Godchepe,</HI> and he was in the enjoyment of it at his Decease, which was in the one and thirtieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After <HI>Godchepe</HI> had deserted the Possession, I find by some old Conrt-rols, that commence from the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, that one <HI>John Melford</HI> had the Possession, not only of <HI>Godwell,</HI> but of <HI>Snodbean,</HI> and <HI>Pepingstraw</HI> likewise, which his Father purchased of the Heirs of <HI>Ditton;</HI> but not long after this, was the Title of those places resident in this Family. For about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find one Moiety of them passed away to <HI>Browne,</HI> and the other to <HI>Colepeper:</HI> in <HI>Colepeper</HI> the Propriety remained, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was demised by Sale to <HI>John Leigh,</HI> and he and Sir <HI>Matthew Browne</HI> the descendant of <HI>Browne,</HI> who was invested by Purchase in the other Moiety, exchanged the whole Mannor with <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and he grants it to <HI>William Wilford, John Bennet,</HI> and <HI>George Briggs,</HI> and they in the thirty seventh year of the above-named Prince, convey one Moiety of <HI>Offham, Snodbean,</HI> and <HI>Peping straw,</HI> to <HI>John Tufton</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to the Right Honorable <HI>John Tufton,</HI> now Earl
<PB N="259" REF="137"/>of <HI>Thanett,</HI> the instant Possessor of it; And the other Proportion, in which <HI>God∣well</HI> was included, to <HI>Richard Nortop alias Clerk,</HI> a Name vulgarly impos'd upon him, which was originally borrowed from his Office, as being Clark of the For∣rest of <HI>Sherwood,</HI> in the County of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> yet this Name hath been so en∣tailed on his Successors, that it is now grown the paternal Appellation of the Family, they having many years wrot <HI>Clerk aliàs Nortop:</HI> But I have digressed. The last of this Family was ...... <HI>Clerk,</HI> who not long since, concluded in three Daughters and Coheirs: <HI>Frances</HI> one of which, was married to Mr. <HI>Thomas Do∣well</HI> lately deceased, who by purchasing the other Proportions allotted to his Wifes Sisters, hath now entituled the other Moietie of the Mannor of <HI>Offham,</HI> to his Descen∣dant now surviving.</P>
<P>The vulgar Tradition of this Parish, is, that <HI>Jack Straw</HI> that eminent Incendi∣arie of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Commons in the raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second (who with <HI>Wat Tiler,</HI> who was born at <HI>Dartford,</HI> were the two principal Emissaries, which did foment and manage that portentous Commotion, which then brake forth like an Inundation, and threatned to over-whelme the abovesaid Prince) was born in a small Cottage, at <HI>Pepingstraw</HI> in this Parish, from whence he assumed his Sirname.</P>
<P><HI>Ore</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was, as the Book called <HI>Feoda Militum</HI> kept in the Exchequer, informs me, in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Inheritance of <HI>Reginald de Cornhill,</HI> but it seems was by a Distance of no long Time constant to this Family; for in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, it became the Patrimony of <HI>Savage</HI> of <HI>Bobbing</HI> Court: for in the twenty third year of the above recited Prince, <HI>John de Savage</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Ore,</HI> as it lay involved in his other Demeasnes, to which that Fran∣chise was granted in the Bulk or General. After <HI>Savage</HI> was worn away at this place, the <HI>Norwoods</HI> of <HI>Norwood</HI> in <HI>Milton,</HI> were established in one Moiety of it by purchase, and the <HI>Alephs</HI> of <HI>Colshall</HI> in <HI>Iwade,</HI> by the same Vicissitude were plan∣ted in the other; <HI>Northwood</HI> demised his Proportion by Sale to <HI>Tomlin,</HI> who for above an Hundred year, down till this instant, has been setled in the Possession; and the other Moiety did augment the Dowry of <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Thomas Aleph,</HI> who was wedded to <HI>John Monins</HI> Esquire, whose Successor Sir <HI>William Monins,</HI> passed it away to <HI>Short</HI> of <HI>Tenterden,</HI> to which Family the Interest of that part of <HI>Ore,</HI> which was sold by <HI>Monins,</HI> is at this present uni∣ted.</P>
<P><HI>Orpington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> was in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Con∣querour, wrapped up in the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, and belonged to the Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> and if you will make an Inspection into the Pages of <HI>Dooms∣day</HI> Book, and consult that general Register, you will find it at that Time thus rated: <HI>Orpindun,</HI> says the Record, <HI>est Manerium Monachorum, &amp; de Vestitu e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum, &amp; in T.

But to return to my Discourse: In times of a more recent Inscription, that is, in the seventh year of King <HI>John,</HI> the Prior and Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> obtained a Market to this their Mannor, to be observed weekly on the Wed∣nesday, as appears <HI>Carta de Anno septimo R. Joannis Memb. secund.</HI> with which Franchise it continued invested, untill the twenty ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and
<PB N="259" REF="137"/>then being by the Monks abovesaid with the Residue of their Revenue into the Hands of that Prince, it remained with the Crown untill the thirty second year of his Government; and then it was granted to <HI>Pereivall Hart,</HI> of <HI>Lullingston</HI> Esq; to whose pious and charitable Beneficence, the Almes Houses at this place, owe their original Foundation; and from him is the Propriety of it, now descended to his great Grandchild <HI>Will. Hart</HI> Esq.</P>
<P><HI>Crofton</HI> in this Parish, did formerly swel into so much of Grandeur, and populacy that it was known for a Parish of it self, till by Fire it was entombed in its present Deso∣lations, and by the Violence of that wild and impetuous Element, reduced into a Heap of Flame and Ruines; and certainly those deplorable Remains which yet expose themselves to an Inquisitive Eye, and the Groundsells too, and scattered Foundations of Houses, which the Plough often raises, out of their Sepulcher of Rubbish, and represents to the publick View, do evince this Truth to us, that Towns and Villages, have their stated Period of Duration, and must at length find a Grave like Men. But though this Village be shrunk into this disordered Heap, yet still it preserves the Reputation of a Mannor, which it had anciently, when it was the Inheritance of <HI>Wibourn,</HI> a Family in elder Times of high Esteem, and a considerable Revenue in this Territory. <HI>Ralph de Wibourn</HI> held Lands here, and in other places of <HI>Kent,</HI> as appears by sundry ancient Deeds now in the Possession of <HI>Wibourne</HI> of <HI>Halkewell,</HI> in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; and did after execute a Deed, for Land in <HI>Wrotham</HI> Hundred, in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second. And in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John de Wybourne,</HI> paid respective Aid for his Lands here and at other places in this County, at the making the Black Prince Knight; after <HI>Wibourne</HI> had relinquished the Possession of this place, which was about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it went away by Sale to Sir <HI>Robert Belknap,</HI> who was attainted and banished, by that Factious Parliament, which was held in the tenth year of <HI>R.</HI> the second, for vigorously endevouring to vindicate and as∣sert his Prerogative, against the Invasions and Inroads which some of the turbulent Nobility of those times did attempt to make upon it: but this, though forfeited and escheated to the Crown upon his pretended Treason, was by <HI>Richard</HI> the second restor'd to <HI>Hamon Belknap</HI> Lord of <HI>Oston</HI> in the County of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and from him it was by Descent transferred to <HI>John Belknap</HI> his Son, who upon his Decease which was in the fifteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, bequeathed it to Sir <HI>Henry Belknap,</HI> who determined in three Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Alice</HI> married to Sir <HI>William Shelley, Anne</HI> matched to Sir <HI>Robert Wotton,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> first wedded to Sir <HI>Philip Cook</HI> of <HI>Giddy-Hall</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> and after to <HI>I eonard Dannett</HI> of the County of <HI>VVorcester,</HI> who divided his Patrimony; but this upon ballancing the partition of the Estate, fell upon the poising of it in e∣quall portions, to be the Demeasn of Sir <HI>VVill. Shelley,</HI> who demised it by Sale to Sir <HI>Rob. Read</HI> Lord Chiefe Justice of the Kings Bench, and he in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, passed it away by Grant, to the Hospital of the <HI>Savoy</HI> in <HI>'London,</HI> where it has ever since, without any Interruption of the first Donation, remained successively resident.</P>
<P><HI>Bark-hart</HI> has obtained a place in the Map of <HI>Kent,</HI> and therefore shall not want one in this Discourse. It was built by <HI>Percivall Hart</HI> Esquire, Father to the late Sir <HI>Percivall:</HI> but it was adorned with this Name by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> when she was magnificently entertained at this place, by the above said Gentleman. Upon her Reception, she received her first Caresses by a Nymph, which persona∣ted the Genius of the House, then the Scene was shifted, and from several Cham∣bers, which, as they were contrived, represented a Ship, a Sea Conflict was offe∣red up to the Spectator's View, which so much obliged the Eyes of this Princesse, with the Charms of Delight, that upon her Departure, she left upon this House (to perpetuate the Memory both of the Author and Artifice) the Name and Appella∣tion of <HI>Bark-hart.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Tradition that <HI>Thomas de Beckett,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> was born at <HI>Tubbingden,</HI> whose Demeasne is partly situated in <HI>Ferneborough,</HI> and part∣ly in this Parish. But to dissipate this received Fiction, I shall manifest out of an old Parliament Roll, of the thirty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the original Truth, that is, so much of it as concerns his Cradle or place of Nativity. The
<PB N="260" REF="138"/>Record in its own Dialect, speaks thus. <HI>James</HI> Earl of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and <HI>Ormond,</HI> whose Fader, and many of his Ancestors are lineally descended of the Blode of the glorious Martyr St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> sometimes Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The which glorious Martyr was born of his Moder, within the Ground where now is set the House or Hospital of the said Martyr, called St. <HI>Thomas Acres,</HI> now in the City of <HI>London,</HI> where the Body of the said Earl lies buried, and Dame <HI>Joane Beauchamp,</HI> late Lady of <HI>Burgavenny,</HI> Crandame to the said Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> and <HI>Wiltshire.</HI> For <HI>Tubbenden</HI> it self; it was Anciently the Demeasne of a Family which was known by that Sirname: for by a Deed now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Wittingham Wood</HI> of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> Esquire, it appears <HI>Gilbert Saundre</HI> of <HI>Crofton</HI> did demise several parcels of Land to <HI>John de Tubbenden</HI> of <HI>Ferneborough,</HI> and to <HI>Richard, Philip, John,</HI> and <HI>Robert</HI> his Sons, in the twenty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, which justifies it Anciently to be the Possession of one of that Name. After <HI>Tubbenden, Belknap</HI> was Proprietary of this place, and then successively by <HI>Alice,</HI> his Co-heir Sir <HI>William Shelley</HI> of <HI>Michelgrove</HI> in <HI>Sussex:</HI> from which Family it was brought down by Purchase in the beginning of the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to be the Estate of <HI>Posier,</HI> who after some few years continuance in the Possession, demised his Concernment in it by Sale to <HI>Dalton</HI> issued out from the <HI>Daltons</HI> of <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> which Name suddainly re∣solved into a Female Heir, known by the Name of <HI>Anne Dalton,</HI> who by matching with <HI>Aunsell Beckett,</HI> linked it to the Demeasne of that Family: from whom it des∣cended to his Son <HI>Matthew Beckett,</HI> who upon his Decease bequeathed it to Mr. <HI>John Winterborn</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who hath lately passed it away to Mr. ...... <HI>Gee</HI> of the County of <HI>Yorke</HI> Esquire.</P>

In Ages of a more modern Date, that is, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>John de Maries</HI> descended from <HI>Thomas de Maries,</HI> who accompanied <HI>Richard</HI> the first to the Seige of <HI>Acon,</HI> enjoyed a whole Knights Fee at <HI>Ackmere</HI> and <HI>Sentling,</HI> two emi∣nent Mannors in this Parish, but about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, had de∣serted the Possession and surrendered it to <HI>Gregory de Rokesley,</HI> Grand-child to <HI>John de Rokesley,</HI> who likewise was embarked with <HI>Richard</HI> the first, at the Seige of <HI>Acon;</HI> and he, in the ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, obtained the Grant of a Market on the Wednesday, and a three Dayes Faire at the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> to St. <HI>Mary Crey,</HI> as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 9. <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. <HI>Memb.</HI> 35. and left it to his Son Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> who dying in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, with∣out Issue-male by <HI>Agnes,</HI> one of his Daughters and Co-heirs to <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> in which Name it continued, until the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then I find it possest by Sir <HI>Robert Belknap,</HI> who was attainted in the tenth year, and ba∣nished into <HI>Ireland</HI> for too vigorously attempting to boulster up the Majesty and Prerogative of that Prince, against the Assaults and invasions which were made upon it by a Factious Junto of the Nobility; yet it was suddainly after restored to his Posterity: for in the ninteenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find <HI>Hamon Belknap</HI> reseated in the Possession, by the Royal Concession and Indulgence of that Prince, and from him it did devolve to his Grand-child Sir <HI>Henry Belknap,</HI> which Family being enterred in Daughters and Co-heirs, Sir <HI>Robert Wotton</HI> by matching with <HI>Anne,</HI> that was one of them, entituled himself in her Right to the Inheritance of both these Places, and so by the Thread of a continued Descent, was it brought down to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> who settled them in Marriage upon his eldest Daughter and Co-heir Mrs. <HI>Katherine Wotton,</HI> who was espoused to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> Heir ap∣parent to <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Chesterfeild.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Orlanston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hamme,</HI> was the Inherirance of a Family of that Sirname. <HI>William de Orlanston</HI> is registred in the List of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who assisted <HI>Richard</HI> the first, at the Siege of <HI>Acon. William de Orlanston</HI> his Son
<PB N="261" REF="138"/>held it, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and obtained a Charter of Free-warren to it, in the one and fiftieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and more to improve the Grandeur of this his Mannor, with Additional Franchises, he likewise obtained a Market to be weekly observed here, and a Fair yearly, which was to continne by the space of three Dayes, at the Feast of <HI>Holyrode,</HI> as appears, <HI>Pat. de</HI> 51. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. <HI>Memb.</HI> 10. The Grant of which Market was renewed and confirmed to <HI>John Kemp</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and after of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. <HI>Willi∣am de Orlanston,</HI> this mans Grand-child, was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and had the Custody of the County some part of the year following, and died the thirty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and had Issue Sir <HI>John Orlanston,</HI> who was Burgess for <HI>Romeney,</HI> as appears by some old Records in <HI>Dover</HI> Castle, sundry Times, both in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and matched with the Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>William at Capell,</HI> from which Alliance proceeded <HI>Richard Orlanston</HI> Esquire, who died possest of <HI>Orlanston,</HI> in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<P>Here were Lands divorced from this Place by no far Distance, called <HI>Oswareston:</HI> for I find <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Augie,</HI> gave to the Monks of <HI>Bermondsey</HI> in <HI>Southwarke</HI> his Lands called <HI>Oswareston</HI> near <HI>Romelin,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Lyda,</HI> and the Lands of <HI>John</HI> the Clerk in <HI>Bilsington,</HI> of which see <HI>Vincents</HI> Book of Nobility, <HI>Fol.</HI> 190.</P>
<P><HI>Westbery</HI> in this Parish, was, as high as the private Evidences of this Place can give us any Prospect to discover, the Propriety of a Family called <HI>Prisott,</HI> who was planted here as high as the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and tis probable much higher, though the Deeds reach no farther. Of this Family was Sir <HI>John Prisot</HI> the Judge, of whom there is frequent mention in our Law Books, which have an Aspect upon the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and in this Name was the Title of this Mannor car∣ried down to the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was by <HI>Thomas Prisot</HI> passed away by Sale to <HI>George Hount,</HI> in whom the Possession had not many years been resident, but the same Fatality brought it over to <HI>Reginald Strogle,</HI> who was in the Commission of the Peace, in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and was des∣cended from a Family which was of a very high Original in <HI>Romney-Mersh,</HI> where there are some Lands yet which bear their Name. After <HI>Strogle</HI> had left it, it came by Purchase to Mr. <HI>Bennet Guildford,</HI> a Branch of the <HI>Guildfords</HI> of <HI>Hempsted,</HI> who in the beginning of the Raign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> falling under the Censure and Penalty of a <HI>Pramunire,</HI> for refusing the Oath of Supremacy, and flying beyond Sea, forfeited this place to the Crown, and this Princesse immediately after passed it away by Grant to <HI>Walter Moile</HI> of <HI>Buckwell,</HI> from whom not many years after this original Concession, it went away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Francis Bourne,</HI> Grand-father to Mr. ...... <HI>Bourne</HI> the present Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ospringe</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was anciently a Limb or Appendage of the Royal Revenue, until King <HI>Edward</HI> the thind, in the tenth year of his Raign, by Royal Concession or Grant, passed it away to <HI>John de Pultency,</HI> afterwards Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> to hold it in Fee of the Crown, by the Service of a Rose, offe∣red up or presented as a Symbol of Annual Fealty, and with this Mannor he granted him likewise all the Advousons of-Churches, which formerly related to it, to hold in Soccage only by the former acknowledgement. In the nineteenth year of his Raign, the above said Prince grants this <HI>John de Pulteney,</HI> that <HI>Thomas</HI> Son of <HI>Willi∣am de Dene</HI> should be accountable to him for all those Knights Fees which lay in <HI>Throuley, Boughton, Malherbe,</HI> and <HI>Wormesell,</HI> and held of <HI>Queen Court</HI> and <HI>Ospringe:</HI> de died possest of both these places, in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 43. and left them to his Kinsman Sir <HI>Nicolas Loveine</HI> (though some part of the Demeasne belonged to <HI>Poulteney,</HI> until the ninth year of
<PB N="262" REF="139"/><HI>Edward</HI> the fourth) which Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> obtained a an Exemplification by Patent in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, how many Knights Fees which lay divided and dispersed into severall places, belonged to his Mannor of <HI>Ospringe;</HI> this Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> had Issue <HI>Nicholas Loveyne,</HI> and <HI>Margaret Loveyne; Nicholas</HI> her Brother deceased without Issue, and so <HI>Philip St. Clere</HI> of <HI>Aldham St. Clere,</HI> who had matched with this his Sister, became his Heir, and she was found to be pos∣sest of these places at her Death, which was in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and in her Right did it descend with <HI>Queen Court,</HI> (which was leased out by <HI>Nich. Loveyne</HI> to <HI>Nicholas Potin,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the twenty first of King <HI>R.</HI> the second, and held his Shrievalty at this place) to <HI>Thomas St. Clere</HI> who held it at his Decease, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 46. But after his Departure, I do not find it long knit to the Demeasn of his Family; for about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, I find it in the Possession of <HI>William Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Shurland</HI> Esquire, and from him was the Title of <HI>Ospringe</HI> and <HI>Queen Court</HI> derived by successive Right to his Grandchild <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> who about the thirteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed them away to Mr. <HI>Rich. Thornehill,</HI> Great Grandfather to Mr. <HI>Richard Thornehill,</HI> Son and Heir of Colonel <HI>Richard Thornhill</HI> who is at this instant Proprietarie of it.</P>
<P><HI>Plomford</HI> and <HI>Bavell,</HI> are two little Mannors in <HI>Ospringe,</HI> which belonged partly to the Nunnery of the <HI>Minster</HI> in <HI>Shepey,</HI> and partly to the Abby of <HI>Feversham,</HI> which upon the Suppression of those two Cloisters, were granted by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> Esquire, and he not long after, alienated them to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> whose Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> passed them away in our Grand∣fathers Memory to <HI>Greenstreet</HI> of <HI>Clacksfield</HI> in <HI>Borden,</HI> and are still wrapt up in the In∣heritance of that Family.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maison le Dieu</HI> here at <HI>Ospringe,</HI> was founded by <HI>Lucas de Vienna,</HI> for the Knights Templers, and was one of those Mansions, where they reposed them∣selves in their progresse towards their other Demeasne, which lay spread into <HI>East-Kent,</HI> and <HI>Romney Mersh.</HI> The Revenue which was to support this Seminary, lay at <HI>Lurdenden</HI> in <HI>Challock,</HI> and at <HI>Hokeling, Radymersh, Ryde</HI> and other places in the Isle of <HI>Shepey.</HI> In the twenty fifth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Roger de Lingsted</HI> had a Grant of these Lands, for Terme of Life, as likewise of all the Fishery Messu∣ages, Reliese, Revenue, and Homage appertaining to them, as appears <HI>Pat. Anno</HI> 25. <HI>Henrici tertii, Memb.</HI> 30. In the forty second, and fifty first of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, there was a Confirmation of Land and Priviledges to this House, and in this Condition it continued, partly under the Knights Templers, and in lower Ages, under the Knights Hospitallers, untill the Tempest of the generall Disso∣lution, shook it into that neglected heap of Ruines, wherein at present the ancient Fabrick is visible.</P>
<P><HI>Elverland</HI> in this Parish is a Mannor which for many Generations hath been annexed to the Demeasn of St. <HI>Johns</HI> Colledge in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Selgrave</HI> now corruptly called <HI>Selgrove,</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Ospringe:</HI> It was a Branch of that large Inheritance, which lay scattered ore the Face of this Terri∣tory, and acknowledged the Dominion of the noble Family of <HI>Norwood: Roger de Northwood</HI> held it at his Decease, which was in the thirteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 25. And transmitted it to his Son <HI>Roger de Norwood,</HI> after whom I do not find the Possession was long permanent in this Family: for about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Ralph de Spigurnell,</HI> was concerned in it as Proprietarie, and he bequeathed it to his Wife <HI>Elizabeth Spigurnell,</HI> who sold it to <HI>John Winchelsey,</HI> and the Convent of <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the six∣teenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, in whom the Fee-simple continued, untill it was wrested away by the Generall Dissolution in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: and then that Prince, passed it by Grant to <HI>George Barley,</HI> who not many years after alienated his Interest in it to <HI>Sonds</HI> of <HI>Throuley,</HI> from whom in our Fathers Memory, it came by Sale to <HI>Cleve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ospringe,</HI> had anciently a House or <HI>Maison le Dieu</HI> so called, because it was a Receptacle for Leprous people, and other persons afflicted and assaulted with Dis∣eases, which in Times of elder Inscription, were still esteemed to be imposed by the
<PB N="263" REF="139"/>Finger of the Divinity, and this had a Confirmation of ample Immunities, and Li∣berties by Patent in the forty seventh, and which were renued in the fifty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P><HI>Otford</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Codsheath,</HI> was given to the Church and Sea of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> by <HI>Offa</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI> in the year 785, to expiate the Guilt of that Blood, which he had before drawn from the Veins of <HI>Aleric</HI> and his <HI>Kentish</HI> Men, in a Battell waged at this place, in the year 774, and which was aggravated because those he had slaughtered, had their Names enrolled in the Re∣gister of Christians. And which was granted in the originall Donation, <HI>ad Pascua Porcorum,</HI> to the Pannage of those Hoggs that fed in the Arch-bishops Chase; and in the Revenue of this Sea, was the Interest of this Mannor treasu∣red up, till about the Beginning of the Rule of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then some envious Eyes looking about with Regrett and Desire, upon the Diffused Patrimo∣ny of the Church, <HI>William Warham</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to extinguish both the passions of these men, and their ravenous Appetite together, about the twelfth year of that Prince's Raign, exchanged this Mannor for other Lands, and so it became in∣corporated into the Revenue of the Crown.</P>
<P>There was a Chantry founded at <HI>Rye-house</HI> in this Parish, by <HI>Henry de Apul∣derfield,</HI> in the forty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears <HI>Pat. Anno.</HI> 46. <HI>Edwardi tertii, Parte secunda Memb.</HI> 19. Whose Revenue upon the Suppression, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to <HI>Palmer,</HI> which Family had been of deep Anti∣quity before in this Parish, and from whence the <HI>Palmers</HI> of <HI>Snodland,</HI> and like∣wise of <HI>Howletts</HI> in <HI>East-Kent,</HI> were originally descended: but it seems the secu∣rity of this royal Patent, could not rescue it from being sold some years after to <HI>Bosvill,</HI> whose Descendant now holds the instant Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Otham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Maidstone,</HI> was a Branch of that Demeasne, which did in this Track acknowledge the Signiory of the ancient Family of <HI>Valoigns. William de Valoigns,</HI> is mentioned in the Book called <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> to have paid Aid for Lands at <HI>Petham, Ashford,</HI> and <HI>Otham,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the marriage of <HI>Isabell</HI> that Prince's Sister, and it is probable that this <HI>VVill. de Valoigns,</HI> dyed possest of <HI>Otham,</HI> in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, for his Name was <HI>VVilliam</HI> likewise, as appears by the escheat Roll, marked with the Number 54. after whom his Successor <HI>Stephen de Valoigns,</HI> held it, who was certainly a man of some important Account in those Times, for he was one of the Conservators of the Peace, in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After <HI>Valoigns,</HI> the knightly Family of <HI>Pimpe,</HI> was by purchase invested about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, both in the Possession of <HI>Otham</HI> and <HI>Gore-court,</HI> and to this Name was the Inheritance both of <HI>Otham</HI> and <HI>Gore-court,</HI> by a Chain of severall Descents, successively united; till at last the ordinary Devolution of purchase brought them over to <HI>Isley</HI> of <HI>Sun∣drich;</HI> and within the Circle of this Family, was the Propriety of them circum∣scribed, till the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and then Sir <HI>Hen. Isley,</HI> being fatally engaged and entangled in the unsuccessefull Attempt of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> could not unravell himself, untill he had satisfied the Justice of that Queen, with the forfeiture of his Life, and augmented the Revenue of the Crown, with the Con∣fiscation of his Estate: from which these two places, as being parcell of his es∣cheated Patrimony, were by Patent soon after, passed away to Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> one of the Serjeants at Law, to the abovesaid Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who dying without Issue-male, bequeathed <HI>Gore-court</HI> to <HI>Hellen</HI> his Daughter and Coheir, who was matched to <HI>Thomas Colepeper;</HI> and <HI>Otham</HI> to his Brother <HI>Thomas Henley;</HI> from whom it is come down to <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Esquire, who is the present Lord of the Fee: but <HI>Gore-court</HI> was by <HI>Colepeper,</HI> demised by Sale to <HI>Buffkin;</HI> where after the Pos∣session had for severall years been fixed, it was almost within the Pale of our Remembrance, by purchase made the present Inheritance of <HI>Tho. Floyd</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Stoneacre</HI> in this Parish is an Ancient Seat, which for some Centuries of years has acknowledged no other Proprietary then <HI>Ellys,</HI> but whether <HI>Burton</HI> in <HI>Kenington,</HI> or this Mansion were the original Fountain, from whence this Family did extract
<PB N="264" REF="140"/>its first Etymology is incertain, for once they had one and the same Possessor. The Deeds that fortifie their Interest in this place, reach as high as the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and instruct us, that <HI>Ellis</HI> which enjoyes it now, is by a stream of many unintercepted Descents issued out from <HI>John Ellis</HI> who possest it then.</P>
<P>There was the Foundation of a Religious Seminary of Canons, <HI>Praemonstratenses</HI> or white Canons, begun at <HI>Otham</HI> by <HI>Ralph de Dene:</HI> but the Situation of the Place, being not accommodated to Health, they were by <HI>Ela de Sackvil</HI> removed and trans∣planted into her new erected Priory at <HI>Begham,</HI> where till the common Suppression they continued undisturbed and fixed.</P>
<P><HI>Otteringdon</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> does represent to us in Prospect the Me∣mory of a Family, to whom it contributed in Times more Arcient both Seat and Sirname. <HI>Ralph de Ottringden</HI> held it at his Decease, which was in the fifteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 29. But in his Son Sir <HI>Lawrence de Ottringden,</HI> both the Name and Male Line failed together, for his Daughter and Heir brought it along with her to <HI>Peyforer,</HI> who about the latter end of the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was extinguished likewise by the same Fatality in <HI>Julian Peyforer,</HI> who was his Heir General, and she, by espousing <HI>Thomas St. Leger</HI> Esquire, intermixed the Right of this place with the Inheritance of this Family, and who lies entombed in this Church, with this Compendious Superscription endorsed upon his Grave∣stone, <HI>Hic jacet Thomas St. Leger de Otteringden, qui obiit</HI> 1408. But a Revolution as suddain as the former, quickly snatched away <HI>Otteringden</HI> from the Patrimony of this Name; for by <HI>Joan,</HI> who was Co-heir to the above-mentioned <HI>Thomas St. Leger,</HI> it was rowled into the Revenue of <HI>Henry Aucher</HI> Esquire sprouted out from the Illustrious Stem of <HI>Aucher</HI> of <HI>Losenham,</HI> and in this Family was the In∣terest of this place successively laid up till the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then the whole Demise was by Sale transmitted to <HI>Lewin,</HI> in whom a Descent or two after the Male-Line determining, the Female Heir brought it to <HI>Rogers</HI> of the <HI>West,</HI> from whom the like Fatality hath lately devolved it to <HI>Charles</HI> Lord <HI>Mansfeld,</HI> eldest Son to the Right Honorable <HI>William Cavendish,</HI> Marquess of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Putwood</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which in Times of elder Etymology, did acknowlede it self to be under the Signory of a Family, who extracted their Sirname from <HI>Vienne</HI> in <HI>Dauphine</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and in several Deeds without Date, there is mention of <HI>William de Vienna,</HI> who was invested in Land here at <HI>Putwood</HI> and <HI>Ospringe,</HI> and in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Lucas de Vienna</HI> paid re∣spective Supply, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for Lands which he held at <HI>Putwood</HI> and <HI>Ospringe.</HI> After this Family was dissolved and gone, the <HI>Quadrings,</HI> which was about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, were settled in the possessi∣on, where after some small Residence of the Title, it went away by Sale about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, to the Ancient Family of <HI>Goldwell</HI> of great <HI>Chart:</HI> and here, after it had made some cursory aboad, the same Devolution cast it into the Inheritance of <HI>Dryland</HI> of <HI>Cokes-ditch</HI> in <HI>Feversham,</HI> to whose possession after the Title had, for many years cleaved, it was transported by purchase into the Patri∣mony of <HI>Atwater,</HI> so styled, because it is probable this Family had formerly their Residence near some Fountain or Stream, but their Original from whence they pri∣mitively issued, was from about <HI>Ospringe:</HI> for there I find <HI>Robert Atwater</HI> possest Land at his Death, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and in this Name did the Title of the place lie couched, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then by Sale it was incorporated into the Revenue of Sir <HI>James Hales:</HI> but long it remained not thus mingled, for the Fate of purchase untwisted it, and not many years after threw it into the Possession of <HI>Sayer,</HI> from whom in Times which almost bordered upon our Memory, it was by Sale wafted over to Mr. <HI>James Hugison</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> and he bequeathed it to a second Son, whose Female Heir Mrs. <HI>Jane Hugison,</HI> by lately matching with Mr. <HI>John Roberts</HI> Esquire, eldest Son to Sir <HI>John Roberts</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> hath entituled him to the Propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Herst</HI> in this Parish, was the Ancient Demeasne of <HI>Filmer,</HI> and here were they seated, until by matching with the Heir of <HI>Argall,</HI> they were transplanted to <HI>East Sutton.</HI> I have seen an old Court-roll relating to the Mannor of <HI>Monkton</HI> in this
<PB N="265" REF="140"/>Parish, which by the Antiquity of it, seemed to commence from the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, although the Date which stood in the Front, by the in urious Hand of Time, was almost expunged, and (so) hardly legible; wherein at the Foot of it, there is mention of one <HI>Edward Filmour,</HI> so he was written in that Age, from whom it is probable (though now the Name by Time and prescription be in the last Syllable of it something violated) the present Sir <HI>Edward Filmer,</HI> eldest Son to that Learned, Loyal, and Worthy Person Sir <HI>Robert Filmer,</HI> lately deceased, is primitively extracted, and this is confirmed by their own private Evidences, which represent them for many Cenerations, even till this present, Possessors of this Place, and wherein the Name is frequently written <HI>Filmor,</HI> aswel as in latter Escripts <HI>Filmer.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Mannor in <HI>Ottringden,</HI> which anciently was reputed so, though now by Disuse and Intermission it hath lost that Estimate, and is called <HI>Hall-place,</HI> by a very Ancient Court-roll <HI>Sans date,</HI> now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Paine.</HI> It is re∣presented, in those Times, when it had Tenants and Services belonging to it, to be the propriety of one <HI>Roger Rev,</HI> and in that Roll there is mention of one <HI>Thomas Franklin,</HI> who held some Lands of this Mannor, by paying yearly the Tribute or Rent-service of one Red Rose, as the Symbol of his Homage. And now for want of farther Light, from the Ancient Deeds and Evidences; I must make a leap to the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then I find <HI>Eugenius Cock,</HI> in the nineteenth year of that Prince, sels it to <HI>John Bunce</HI> of this Parish Gentleman, in which Family the possession rested, until very lately it was by Sale alienated to Mr. <HI>Paine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monkton</HI> is the last place in this Parish of Note: It belonged before the suppressi∣on to the Nunnery of <HI>Davington,</HI> and was given to that Cloyster by <HI>Matthew</HI> Son of <HI>Hamon Atfrith,</HI> upon the first Erection of it, which was in the thirty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. Upon the suppression and final Dissolution' of this Covent of <HI>Davington,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was by that Prince granted to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheney,</HI> whose Son the Lord <HI>Henry Cheyney</HI> (so fugitive is the Tenure of Church-Demeasne) in the entrance into the raign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away to <HI>Godden;</HI> who so small a space was resident in the possession, that he hath only left us Notice that he sold it to <HI>William Lewin,</HI> descended from the <HI>Lewins</HI> of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Justinian Lewin</HI> concluded in a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Rogers</HI> of the County of <HI>Somersett,</HI> and so in her Right it became interwoven with his De∣measne: but remained not long thus involved in the Interest of this Name, for in our Memory he deceased, and left only a Daughter and Heir; who is lately matched to <HI>Charles Cavendish</HI> Lord <HI>Mansfeld,</HI> eldest Son to <HI>William</HI> Lord Marquess of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> so that <HI>Monkton</HI> in his Ladies Right is now united to his Inheritance.</P>
<P>There are two Chappels in the Parish Church of <HI>Ottringden:</HI> that on the North∣side of the Chauncel is called <HI>Ottringdens</HI> Chappel, where the Remains of several of the <HI>Ottringdens, St. Legers, Auchers,</HI> and <HI>Lewins,</HI> lie enterred: that on the South∣side is termed <HI>Bunces</HI> Chappel, where the Ashes and Reliques of several of that Fa∣mily slumber, who were of no contemptible Note in this Parish, where they had a Mansion, which in old Evidences is called <HI>Bunces</HI> Court, which hath been in their possession, as appears by their own Deeds, some Hundreds of years; and from hence are the <HI>Bunces</HI> of <HI>Throuley,</HI> likewise originally issued forth.</P>

<P><HI>PAdlesworth</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Lovingborough,</HI> is so obscure and inconsiderable a Village, that it should not have filled a place in this Register, but that it was a portion of that wide Estate which lay spread over the Face of all the adjacent Ter∣ritorie, and acknowledged it self to be under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Criolls. Ber∣tram de Crioll</HI> died about the middle of. <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and left <HI>Joan</HI> his Sole Heir, who had been before matched to Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley</HI> of <HI>Rokesley</HI> Court in <HI>North∣crey,</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="141"/>and so <HI>Padlesworth</HI> became the <HI>Rokesley's,</HI> but did not long cleave to that Name, for he expired likewise in two Female Co-heirs, whereof one of them called <HI>Joan</HI> was matched to <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> and he left Issue <HI>Michael Poynings,</HI> from whom it came down to his descendant <HI>Robert Poynings,</HI> who passed it away by Sale to <HI>Fogge</HI> of <HI>Sene</HI> in <HI>Newington,</HI> in which Family the Title for many Descents lay involved, even until our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was alienated to <HI>Dynley,</HI> who is the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Padlesworth</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkefeild,</HI> was, as high as the raign of <HI>H.</HI> the third, the Possession of a Family called <HI>Chetwind,</HI> who immediatly after exchanged it with <HI>Hamon de Gatton,</HI> for the Mannor of <HI>Hocklin</HI> in the County of <HI>Bedford,</HI> but kept it not long: for after it had continued some smal Interval of Time in this Family, it was alienated to the Noble Family of <HI>Huntingfeild,</HI> after whom succeeded <HI>Bele,</HI> and then it went away by Sale to <HI>Bullock,</HI> who by the same Devolution surrendred the possession to <HI>Diggs,</HI> where it had but a very transitory aboad, for he conveyed it away to <HI>Peckham,</HI> from whom the ordinary Mutation made by Purchase, brought it to own the Propriety of <HI>Vine∣ley,</HI> who translated his Interest by Sale unto <HI>William Clifford</HI> of <HI>Bobbing-court,</HI> and he about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fixt fixed the Title and Possession by Sale in <HI>Robert Bambergh.</HI> Where it is to be noted, that this quick and suddain Revolution of the Title of this place in those Families, which intervened between <HI>Hunting∣feild</HI> and <HI>Bambergh,</HI> happened in lesse then a Circle of fifty years, (as appears by the original Conveyances now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Marsham.</HI>) But to advance in that Discourse where I broke off; <HI>Robert Bambergh</HI> above-mentioned, was not long set∣tled in his new Acquists, but he deceased and left it to his Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Nicolas Wotton</HI> Esquire, from whom in a direct Line it came down to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> who settled it in Marriage upon his Daughter and Co-heir <HI>Katherine Wotton</HI> with <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> eldest Son, and Heir apparent, to <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Chesterfeild,</HI> and this Lady hath since passed it away to my Noble Friend, <HI>John Marsham</HI> of <HI>Whornes-place</HI> in <HI>Cuckeston</HI> Esquire, from whose Deeds and Pa∣pers I have drawn my present Intelligence.</P>
<P><HI>Patricksbourn</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Bredge</HI> and <HI>Pet-ham,</HI> in Ancient Records hath still the Addition of <HI>Cheyney</HI> annexed to it: for indeed it was the first and original Residence of the <HI>Cheyneys,</HI> before they translated their Habitation to <HI>Shurland</HI> in <HI>Shepey,</HI> by matching with the Heir of <HI>Shurland.

<P><HI>Peckham</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Twyford</HI> and <HI>Littlefeild,</HI> is distinguished from the other; first by its Bulk and Dimension, this being called commonly great <HI>Peckham;</HI> and then secondly by its Situation, being styled in Records <HI>East-Peckham.</HI> It was given to the Church of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> that is, <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by Queen <HI>Edgiva,</HI> to the Monks of that Covent, <HI>ad Cibum,</HI> for a support of their Diet and Alimony, in the year of Grace, nine hundred forty and one: and if you will see how it was rated in the great Register of Domes-day Book, take here a View of it; <HI>Peckham,</HI> saies that Record, <HI>Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro VI. Sullings,</HI> and so forth: <HI>Peckham</HI> in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the King, that is the Confessor, went for seven Plough-Lands, and defends it self now (that is, in the Time of the Con∣queror) after the same Estimate, and was rated upon the Appraisement formerly at twelve <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> but now is stated at eight. And, thus regulated, was it for many Ages fastned to the Patrimony of the Church, until the Dissolution, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, unloosned the Cement, in the twenty ninth year of that Prince; who afterwards about the thirty sixth year of his Raign, grants this and divers other parcels of the Church-Demeasne to Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> who not long after by Livery and Seisin, passes away his Right in it to <HI>George Moulton</HI> Esquire: but because there was a Fine and Recovery wanting, the Sale was imperfect, so that he had it only in Abeiance (as the Law styles it) or in Expectance, so that the Crown, in the second of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> upon the Defection and Attaint of Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Wiat,</HI> finding this in the Tenure of <HI>Moulton,</HI> seised upon it as parcel of <HI>Wiats</HI> Estate, because it had not been before legally conveyed.

<P>There is an eminent Seat in this Parish called <HI>Roydon-Hall,</HI> which was before cal∣led <HI>Fortune,</HI> but was of no great Account, until about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then <HI>Roydon</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> came into this County, and seated himself here, and erected this Pile, upon which he fixed his own Name, which it hath been known by ever since, though it hath changed its Possessor: for this Family was ex∣tinguished in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who was the only surviving Issue of <HI>Thomas Roydon</HI> Esquire, who by matching with <HI>William Twisden</HI> Esquire, made it the Inheritance of <HI>William Twisden</HI> Esquire Great Grand-father to Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Knight and Baronet, who obtained a Charter of Free-warren from the late King to re∣duce a certain proportion of Ground into a Parke which is that the House is surrounded with at present, though the House owe much of its Magnificence and Splendor to the Care and Expence of his Grand-father <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esquire, and his Father Sir <HI>William Twisden</HI> Knight and Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Alban</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Auburne,</HI> is another place of eminent Consideration in <HI>East-Peckham.</HI> This with <HI>Black-pits,</HI> in this Parish, was anciently the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Pollard:</HI> for <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>John Pollard</HI> in the thirty forth year

<P><HI>Eastmere</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>East-Peckham,</HI> which acknowledged a Family called <HI>Remkin,</HI> anciently to be its Possessors: <HI>John Remkin,</HI> was Father of <HI>Christian Remkin,</HI> who held it, as appears by an ancient Court-roll, in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and from him, did it, by paternal Vicissitude, devolve to <HI>Nicholas Remkin,</HI> in whom the male-line failed: so that <HI>Alice</HI> his Sole Daugh∣ter became the visible Heir to his Estate, and she by matching with <HI>Thomas Rolfe</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> knit this and other Land here at <HI>Great Peckham,</HI> to his Patrimony, but it did not long thus continue united, for <HI>John Rolfe</HI> his Son, in the sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, conveys it to <HI>Richard Ruyton,</HI> and he in the eighth year of the abovesaid Prince, alienated it to <HI>William Hextall:</HI> but he deceasing without Issue∣male, <HI>Margaret,</HI> his Sole Daughter, by her Inter-marriage with <HI>William Whetenhall,</HI> originally descended from the ancient Family of <HI>Whetenhall</HI> of <HI>Whetenhall</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> cast it into the Possession of that Name, from whom it is now descended to my worthy Friend <HI>Thomas Whetenhall</HI> of <HI>Hextall</HI> Court, Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Spilfted</HI> is a fourth Mannor in this Parish: It was the Inheritance for diverse Ages (as appears by the Evidences, now in the Custody of Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI>) of an an∣cient Family called <HI>Cayser;</HI> the last of which Name, who enjoyed this place, was <HI>John Cayser,</HI> who went out in Daughters and Coheirs; one of which was wedded to <HI>Matthew Chetwind,</HI> to whom, this place, upon the Separation of the Estate in∣to parcells, in his Wifes Right accrued; and he after some small residence in the Possession, passed away his Right by Sale in the one and fortieth year of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> to <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esq. Grand-father to Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Knight and Baronet the instant Lord of the Fee, a Person upon whom I need drop no other Character, when I say, that in these times, when there is such a Damp, and Astonishment, by publick blastings and discouragements cast upon Literature, He is both a Gentle∣man and a Scholler.</P>

<P>Here is likewise a Seat in <HI>Peckham</HI> very venerable for its Antiquity, which in old Rolls, is called <HI>Hextall Court,</HI> and was the Mansion of Gentlemen of princi∣pal Account in this Track.

<P><HI>West-Peckham</HI> or <HI>Little Peckham,</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Twyford</HI> and <HI>Littlefield,</HI> was annexed to the Demeasne of the Knights Templars, when <HI>John Colepeper</HI> foun∣ded a Praeceptory here for them, in the year of our Lord 1 .... which upon the finall Extirpation, and Dissolution of their Order, here in <HI>England,</HI> in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, was granted to the Knights Hospitallers, and was sometimes called a Praeceptory, and sometimes a Commandry. Now a Praecep∣tory was a Benefice in Kind, and was termed so; because this, and all others of the same Capacity, were possest by the more eminent sort of Templars, whom the Chief Master created and called <HI>Praeceptores Templi;</HI> A Commandry was some principal Mannor of the Knights Hospitallers, wherein was placed some Brother of the Order, who could not dispose of the Profits of it, but was to mannage it only to the Use of the whole Fraternity, deducting so much of the Revenue, as might support his Livelyhood and Subsistence, of which see more in Dr. <HI>Cowells Interpreter,</HI> in his Notes and Comment upon the word Commaundry. This upon the Suppression, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty second year of his raign, granted to Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI> afterwards of the Privy Councell to King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> who not long after alienated it to Sir <HI>Edmund Wal∣singham</HI> of <HI>Scadbery,</HI> Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower,</HI> from whom it came down by Des∣cent, to my Noble Friend Sir <HI>Thomas Walsingham,</HI> his Great Grand-child, who not long since, passed it over by Sale, to his Son in Law Mr. <HI>James Masters.</HI></P>

And <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the twenty fifth year of his raign, granted it to <HI>Humphrey Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> whose infortunate Grand∣child, <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> endeavouring by a specious Semblance of Vanity and Ostentation, guilded with all the Cunning and Pompe of Magnificence to make himself popular, and entering afterwards into Consultation with a Monk, and another, who pretended to the dark Art of Necromancy, about the Succession of the Crown, poured in so many Jealousies into the Bosome of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which were multiplied to the height of Treason by the malice of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> that nothing could allay or appease them, but the Effusion of this mans Blood, in the twelfth year of that Prince, upon a <HI>Scaffold.</HI> Upon whose infortunate <HI>Exit,</HI> this Mannor escheated to the Crown, and here it remained, until King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted it to his faithful Servant Sir <HI>Ralph Vane,</HI> who being entangled with <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Somersett,</HI> in that obscure Design, which was destructive to them both, in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; this was again seised upon by the Crown, as escheated by his Conviction, and remained with its Revenue, until the above-said Prince, in the sixth year of his Government, by Royal Concession planted the Inheritance in Sir <HI>William Sidney</HI> his Tutor, who was likewise Lord <HI>Chamberlain</HI> of his Houshold, and one of his Privy Councel: from whom it is des∣cended to his great Grand-child, the Right Honorable <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> de∣signed Lord Lievtenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> and he is the instant Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Pencehurst Halymote</HI> is another little Mannor in this Parish, and had still the same Owners with <HI>Pencehurst,</HI> and upon the Tragedy of <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> devolving by Escheat to the Crown, lay couched in the Royal Revenue, un∣til the State not many years since, passed it away by Grant to Colonel <HI>Robert Gibbons.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Pepenbury,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Pembury,</HI> is seated in the Hundreds of <HI>Watchlingston</HI> and <HI>Twyford,</HI> and contains within the Limits of it that noted Seat called <HI>Bayhall,</HI> which was the Ancient Seat of the Ancient Family of <HI>Colepepers.</HI> The first of which whom I find made eminent by Record, is <HI>Thomas de Colepeper,</HI> who was as appears by the Bundels of incertain years in the Pipe-Office one of the <HI>Recognitores Magnae Assisae,</HI> in the raign of King <HI>John;</HI> a place, if we consider the <HI>Meridian</HI> of those Times, for which it was calculated, that is, before the establishment of the Con∣servators of the Peace, of eminent Trust and Concernment. And certainly this man was Father of that <HI>Thomas Colepeper,</HI> who was brought upon the Stage, and his Tragedy represented at <HI>Leeds</HI> Castle, where he was sacrificed to the Anger of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, because he was a more faithful <HI>Castellan</HI> to the Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> then he was a Loyal Subject to his Soveraign, and with his Life he lost his Estate here at <HI>Pepenbury:</HI> Yet I find by the close Rols of the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Memb.</HI> 5. that there was much of his Land here, and in other places, by the Indulgence of that Prince, restored to his Son <HI>Thomas de Colepeper,</HI> but yet the Mannor and this Seat remained lodged in the Crown; yet certainly it was no contemptible parcel of Land, that was granted back: for <HI>Richard</HI> the second by Royal Concession gave Licence to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> to inclose fifty Acres of Land into a Park at <HI>Pepenbury.</HI> But to advance: In the twenty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the Crown devests it self of its Right to both these places, and transplants it by Grant into <HI>Humphrey Stafford</HI> the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> from whom they des∣cended to his infortunate Grand-child, <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who lost both his Life and Estate, being attainted in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: After his Tragedy, they continued until the twenty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the possession of the Crown, and then they were passed away by Grant to Sir <HI>Edward Guldford,</HI> and again confirmed to him, in the twenty eighth year of that Prince's raign, and from him not long after by <HI>Joane</HI> his Female Heir, they increa∣sed the Patrimony of <HI>John Dudley,</HI> after Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and he in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, alienated them to <HI>Thomas Cromwell</HI> Earl of <HI>Es∣sex,</HI> whose Story, Tragedy, and Attaint, in the thirty second year of the above∣said Prince, are represented to our view in such obvious Characters, that I shall not need again to unvail them. Upon his ruinous Catastrophe, they revert to the Crown, and lay shut up in the Royal Revenue, until the thirty seventh year of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the eighth, and then they were made by a new Grant the Inheritance of <HI>William Wybourn</HI> and <HI>Anthony Brown</HI> Esquires; but that Proportion which was setled in <HI>Brown,</HI> was not long resident in that Family; for in the sixth year of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> it was alienated to <HI>William VVybourn</HI> Esquire: nor was the Interest of these places of any long Date after this in <HI>VVybourn,</HI> for in our Grand-fathers Memory, the Fate of Sale annexed them to the Patrimony of <HI>Thomas Sackvill</HI> Lord <HI>Buckurst,</HI> whose Grand-child the Right Honorable <HI>Edward Sackvill</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> not many years since conveyed his Right in them to Mr. ...... <HI>Amherst.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Halkewell</HI> is an eminent Mannor in this Parish and was a Branch of that Demeasne, which fell under the Signory of the Priory of <HI>Begham,</HI> and so remained until the Dissolution, and then it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, about the Time of their suppres∣sion, that is, 1525. granted to <HI>John VVybourn,</HI> who was Tenant to that Abby upon the Suppression; but was Anciently seated at a place called <HI>Culverdens,</HI> whither they arrived from about <HI>Crofton</HI> in <HI>Orpington,</HI> where they originally were planted, about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the third: and from this <HI>Iohn VVybourn,</HI> was Mr. <HI>Benjamin VVybourn</HI> descended, who upon his late Death hath left this Mannor to his Widow Mrs. <HI>Blanch VVybourn,</HI> eldest Daughter to Sir <HI>Iohn Philipott</HI> of the County of <HI>South-Hampton.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Preston</HI> situated in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> contains sundry places within the Boundaries of it, of no vulgar Account. The first is <HI>Makenade,</HI> which was the Mansion for many Ages, of Gentlemen of that Sitname, whereof <HI>VVilliam Make∣nade</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty at this House, which then was of more Magnificence, though now it lye almost gasping in its own Ruines, being crushed into that Disorder by the rough Hand of Time; from this Man it descended to his Grandchild <HI>VVilliam Makenade,</HI> who in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, dying without Issue-male, <HI>Constance Makenade,</HI> his only Daughter became his Heir, who carried this Seat along with her, to her Husband <HI>John VVaterslip,</HI> by whom she had Issue <HI>Marga∣ret,</HI> matched to <HI>Henry London,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> wedded to <HI>Thomas Mathew,</HI> who upon the Division of the Estate, shared this House, and the Land which related to it; in which Family after the Inheritance had been for several years shut up, it at length by Sale went out to <HI>Maycot,</HI> who about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> passed it away by Sale to <HI>Martin James</HI> Esquire, Register of the Chance∣ry, whose Great Grand-child Mr. ....... <HI>James,</HI> enjoys the present Fee-Simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Perry Court</HI> in <HI>Preston</HI> was the Mansion of a good old Family called <HI>Barrett,</HI> who enjoyed this Seat as high as the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and then, I find it was under the Signiory of one <HI>Iohn de Perry,</HI> to whom, and to whose Family it seems, it afforded anciently, both Seat and Sirname: <HI>Valentine Barrett,</HI> who mat∣ched with <HI>Cicelie,</HI> Daughter and Coheir of <HI>Marcellus Att Leeze,</HI> and Niece of Sir <HI>Richard Att Leeze,</HI> was the last of the Name who held this place; for he deter∣mined in <HI>Cicelie</HI> his only Daughter and Heir, who was wedded to <HI>John Darrell</HI> of <HI>Cale-hill</HI> Esquire, for his first Wife, who was elder Brother of Sir <HI>William Darrell,</HI> under-Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> branched out from the knightly Family of the <HI>Dar∣rells</HI> of <HI>Sesay</HI> in <HI>York-hire</HI> whose Heir General matched with the Ancestor of <HI>Dawney,</HI> now Proprietary of that place, and by this Alliance, <HI>Perry Court</HI> came to be knit to to the Demeasn of <HI>Darrell</HI> of <HI>Cale-hill,</HI> for many Descents, untill, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it fell to be divided between two Brothers, Sir <HI>James Darrell</HI> Knight, and <HI>John Darrell</HI> Gentleman. <HI>John Darrell</HI> in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, alienated his proportion to <HI>Stephen Jennins,</HI> and he in the sixth year of that Prince, conveyed it to <HI>Thomas Michell</HI> and he in the eighth of his raign, passed it a∣way to <HI>Robert Dokket,</HI> who two years after demised it to <HI>Alan Percy;</HI> and <HI>Alan Percy</HI> in the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, transmitted it by Sale, to <HI>John Park,</HI> who likewise purchased the other Moiety, the same year of Sir <HI>James Darrell,</HI> and so be∣came sole Owner of <HI>Perry Court,</HI> from whom by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, it was carried off, to <HI>John Roper</HI> of <HI>Lingsted</HI> Esquire, and he in the twen∣ty fifth year of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> transferred all his Concernment in it to <HI>William Finch,</HI> by whose Daughter and Coheir, it was annexed to the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Drue Drewry</HI> of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> and he in the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> passed it away to <HI>Thomas Bennet</HI> Esquire, whose Descendants are still entituled to the Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Westwood</HI> is a third place in <HI>Preston</HI> not to be declined in our Account. It was, as high as I can trace out, under the Jurisdiction of the eminent Family of <HI>Poy∣nings. Michaell Poynings,</HI> who was Son of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Poynings,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 14. And from him did it by a constant Tide of uninterrupted Interest, sur∣render it self up to Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> who in the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="144"/>the eighth, dyed without any lawful Issue, and as it appeared too then without any collateral Alliance, that could by any Title knit by never so far distant an Affinity to him lay the Foundations of any pretended Claim to his estare; so that it escheated to the Crown, and <HI>K.H.</HI> the eighth in the thirty second and thirty third of his Rule gran∣ted it to <HI>I. Limsey,</HI> who not many years after, passed it away to Alderman <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Ancestor to Sir <HI>Iohn Garret</HI> of the County of <HI>Hertford</HI> Baronet, in whom the possession of this place is at this instant resident.</P>
<P><HI>Preston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wingham,</HI> was the Inheritance of the Lord <HI>Leybourn. William de Leybourn,</HI> had a Grant of a Market and a Fair, to his Mannor of <HI>Preston,</HI> in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; from whom it descended to his Son <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> who went out in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Juliana Leybourn,</HI> so often mentioned in this Discourse, who first matched to <HI>John de Hastings,</HI> a Kinsman of <HI>Laurence de Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI> That he was not his Son, is most evident, for then he must by Consequence, have been her second Husband: for <HI>William de Clinton</HI> who was her second Husband, and hath been by publike Records, al∣ways so reputed, deceased by the Testimony of all, in the twenty eighth of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third: <HI>Juliana</HI> his Wife, in the forty third year of that Prince, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 57. And <HI>John de Hastings</HI> in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, which upon a serious Computation of Time, makes it impossible that this <HI>John de Hasting,</HI> whom all conclude to have been her first Husband should be that <HI>John,</HI> who was Son to <HI>Laurence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke;</HI> nor could it be any other <HI>William de Clinton,</HI> then this before mentioned. First, because he was the last Earl of <HI>Huntington</HI> of the Name. Secondly, if we should make him to be any other, he must be designed Husband for this <HI>Juliana,</HI> after the Death of this <HI>John de Hasting,</HI> who survived this <HI>Juliana</HI> six years, as appears by the former ballancing of Time, which will appear altogether absurd and impossible. Thirdly, all do concurre, that this <HI>VVilliam de Clinton</HI> who was her second Husband, was Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, Admiral of the Narrow-Seas Westward in the fifteenth year, and had the Custody of all the Kings Forrests Southwards beyond <HI>Trent,</HI> in the seven∣teenth year of that Prince's Government, which could be no other, than this <HI>VVilliam</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> who although he were fruitful in Offices, he was not so in Children, for he dyed without Issue by this Lady <HI>Juliana,</HI> who after his death re∣mained in the State of Widowhood (for ought I can yet discover) untill her decease: for in the Escheat-roll mentioned before, she is styled <HI>Comitissa de Huntington,</HI> upon whose death, none appearing either directly or collaterally, who justly could enti∣tle themselves to her Patrimony, the Crown claimed it as an escheat; and <HI>Richard</HI> the second, granted it to Sir <HI>Simon de Burleigh,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, who being afterwards attainted, in the tenth year of that Prince it was re-invested in the royal Revenue, and was not long after by <HI>Richard</HI> the second, granted to the Abby of St. <HI>Mary Grace</HI> on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> and some part of it to the Priory of <HI>Canons Langley,</HI> and sometimes written <HI>Childrens Langley:</HI> and here it dwelt untill the general Suppression, and then King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> whose Daughter and Coheir <HI>Amy Motle,</HI> incorported it into the demeasne of her Husband Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe:</HI> where it had had no long aboad, when this Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> dyed without Issue-male, and left his estate to be divided between four Daughters and Coheirs: <HI>Anne</HI> one of whom, carried this a∣way to Sir <HI>Thomas Chichley,</HI> of the County of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> whose Son <HI>Thomas Chich∣ley</HI> Esquire, hath lately by Sale transmitted his Right in it, to Mr. ..... <HI>Spence,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Robert Spence</HI> of <HI>Baukham</HI> in <HI>Sussex.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Preston</HI> by <HI>VVingham</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to it on the <HI>Monday,</HI> and a Fair of three days continuance, at the Feast of St. <HI>Crosse,</HI> in the thirty fifth of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first. Sir <HI>Simon de Burleigh,</HI> had the Grant of a Market renued to this place on the <HI>Friday,</HI> and a Fair by the space of three days at the Feast of St. <HI>Mildred</HI> the Virgin, in the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second.</P>
<P><HI>Petham</HI> gives Name in part, to that Hundred wherein it hath its Position, being called the Hundred of <HI>Bredge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> and was always a Mannor folded up in
<PB N="274" REF="145"/>the revenue of the Arch-bishop, though I confess I cannot trace out in the wilderness of Antiquity who was the first Donor. If you peruse the Pages of <HI>Doomes-day</HI> Book, you wil find it there thus represented; <HI>Petham est proprium Manerium Archiepiscopi &amp; in Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro</HI> VII <HI>Sullings, &amp; nunc similiter, &amp; est appretiatum</HI> XX <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> And this is enough to refute that mistake in <HI>Eadmerius</HI> not long since printed by Mr. <HI>Selden:</HI> which I believe is only by Accident and not voluntary, which says that <HI>Anselm</HI> mortgaged or pawned <HI>Peckham</HI> to the Monks of <HI>Canterbury</HI> which was long before given to them by Q. <HI>Edgiva:</HI> Indeed it should have been printed <HI>Petham;</HI> that be∣ing always as you have seen a Mannor of the Arch-bishops, till it was engaged, which it seems was never redeemed; for it continued in the revenue of the Monks in <HI>Christ∣church,</HI> until the Dissolution; and then it was transplanted into the revenue of the Crown, and lay there until K. <HI>James</HI> in our Fathers memory granted it to <HI>Tho.

<P><HI>Swerdling</HI> is a Mannor in this Parish of as eminent Account as any in this Track, and was the Capital Mansion of the Noble and ancient Family of <HI>Valoigns. Ruallo de Valoigns</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and in the Pipe-rolls of that year, is written of <HI>Swerdling:</HI> and he was witness to King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Char∣ter,

Waretius de Valoigns</HI> is in the Catalogue of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen who assisted <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Acon</HI> in <HI>Palestine. Robert de Valoigns</HI> had the Repute of a Baron in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and under that Notion held the fourth part of a Knights Fee of <HI>Wallingford</HI> Castle. <HI>Allan de Valoigns,</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the thirty first, thirty second, thirty third, and thirty fourth years of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Swerdling. Waretius de Valoigns</HI> in the forty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, by his Deed remits divers Services to <HI>Cicely</HI> Wife of <HI>Robert de Grencbold</HI> which were due from her to his Mannor of <HI>Swerdling. William de Valoigns</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and his Son Sir <HI>William de Valoigns</HI> was engaged with <HI>Edward</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for some remarkable Service there performed, received the Order of Knighthood. <HI>Henry de Valoigns</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the four∣teenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and he had Issue <HI>Waretius de Valoigns,</HI> in whom the Male-line failed, so that his two Daughters, (one matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Fogge</HI> Grand∣child to <HI>Otho Fogge,</HI> who came out of <HI>Lancashire</HI> into <HI>Kent</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, and the other wedded to <HI>Tho. de Aldon</HI>) became his Heirs: and this upon the breaking of the estate into parcels fell to be the proportion of <HI>Fogge,</HI> in which Name after it had for divers ages continued fixed, it was in that Age we style our Grandfathers alienated to <HI>Spelman,</HI> and this Family not many years since determining in a Female Heir, it is now by matching with her become the Inheritance of <HI>Hadds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sapinton</HI> in <HI>Petham</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Bregge;</HI> for in the forty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Hauts-place</HI> in this Parish was the Fountain from whence that noble Family which fell under that Sirname originally streamed out, which afterwards dispersed it self in sub-divided Rivolets over the face of this County. <HI>Ivo de Haut,</HI> the first of this Name that ancient Record represents to us, is mentioned in a Book kept in the Exchequer called <HI>Liber de Terris Templariorum,</HI> which is a Survey of those Lands that Order held in <HI>England</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> One thousand one hundred and eighty; and there it is
<PB N="275" REF="145"/>affirmed that he held this Mannor of <HI>Temple Waltham,</HI> and from this <HI>Ivo de Haut</HI> did the Title in a never-ebbing Current of Descent glide down to Sir <HI>William Haut,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the sixteenth year, and then again promoted to that Office in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and not long after deceased, and with him the Name found its Funeral in two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which termed <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was matched to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury</HI> Esquire, to whom this place in the right of his Wife devolved. And from his Family in the Age within the con∣fines of our Grand-fathers Remembrance, it was passed away by Sale to <HI>Salkeld,</HI> who not many years since conveyed the Possession over to <HI>Bateman.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Chauntry founded at <HI>Depden</HI> in this Parish (as appears by a Manuscript in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Thomas Den</HI> Recorder of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> lately deceased,) founded and endowed by <HI>William Gratian</HI> Priest in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; Whose Re∣venue upon the Dissolution of this Chauntry in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, was granted to <HI>Jo.

Forbrasse</HI> Yeoman, a Name in some old Deeds written <HI>Fortbrasse,</HI> which argues it to be of French extraction, and from this Family it was about the Beginning of K. <HI>James</HI> carried off by Sale to <HI>Gregory,</HI> who within the Verge of some few years fast past, alie∣nated the Title to <HI>Sladden</HI> of <HI>Liminge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Postling</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Hene,</HI> and was, in Ages of a very high Ascent, the Patrimony of the Noble Family of <HI>Columbers,</HI> a Name in Times of elder Cognisance of very great reputation in the <HI>West</HI> of <HI>England; Philip de Columbariis</HI> or <HI>Columbers,</HI> held it at his Decease, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot.

The next that is repre∣sented to be Possessor of it, is <HI>Hugh de Audley,</HI> and he held it as appears by ancient Court-rolls in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and passed it a∣way to <HI>Delves</HI> of <HI>Delves Court</HI> in the County of <HI>Chester,</HI> where it seems it had no long aboad; for about the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John de Delves</HI> alienates it to <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell;</HI> for which the Earl is pardoned, because he purchased it without License first obtained from the King as appears, <HI>Pat. de An<SUP>o</SUP></HI> 43. <HI>Edw. tertii Parte secunda Memb. septim.</HI> And in this Family was it for many Generations fixed and resident; until the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was by Sale transmitted to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher.</HI> But the Tenure of it in this Family was brief and Transitory; for about the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it went away from this Name to <HI>Robert Cranmer</HI> Esquire, Nephew to <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI> who expiring in a Female Heir, she brought it along with her to Sir <HI>Arthur Harris</HI> of <HI>Crixey</HI> in <HI>Essex;</HI> from whom it is devolved to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Cranmer Harris,</HI> who holds the instant Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Henewood</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, from whence the <HI>Honywood</HI> of <HI>Elm∣sted,</HI> and those of <HI>Pett</HI> in <HI>Charing</HI> do extract their Sirname: And <HI>Edmund de Honywood</HI> who in the raign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the third is remembred in the Front and Van of those in the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Horton</HI> Priory, who were munificent Benefactors to that Covent, is set down there to have been of <HI>Postling,</HI> and as this Place was then, so is it still through all that Flux and Decursion of Time which hath since elapsed, wound up in that revenue, which acknowledges the Signorie and Jurisdiction of this ancient Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Pluckley</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calehill,</HI> was originally a Mannor which owned the Arch-bishops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for Lords of the Fee, until <HI>Lanfranc</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> gave it to <HI>William</HI> Brother of <HI>John de Cobham,</HI> who in the Grant is styled <HI>Miles Archiepiscopi;</HI> not that he was ever any Knight or Souldier that attended upon him; but that he granted him this Mannor to hold in Knights Service of him and his Successors, which was very usual and customary for the Arch-bishops and other great Prelates to do; until King <HI>Edward</HI> the first growing jealous of the Power and Gran∣deur of the Clergie, who endeavoured by their Bounty and magnificent Donations to oblige both the principal of the Nobility and Gentry, and chain them up by these extraordinary Engagements to their Devotion, caused the Statute called <HI>Quia emptores Terrarum,</HI> in the one and twentieth of his raign to be made, which restrains and
<PB N="276" REF="146"/>supersedes for the future all new Creations of Mannors. But to proceed, <HI>VVilliam de Cobham</HI> being thus enstated in this Mannor, in Gratitude to the first Donor, al∣tered his Name from <HI>Cobham</HI> to <HI>Pluckley.</HI> Sir <HI>Richard de Pluckley</HI> this mans Grand∣child, flourished in the raign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and founded the Church at <HI>Pluckley;</HI> and from this man did <HI>VVilliam de Pluckley</HI> lineally branch out, in whom the Male-Line concluded, so that <HI>Agnes</HI> his Daughter and Heir, by matching with <HI>John Surrenden</HI> Esquire, cast <HI>Pluckley</HI> into the Possession of that Name and Family: where it had not long sojourned, when the same Vicissitude brought it over to <HI>Haut:</HI> for <HI>James Haut</HI> wedded <HI>Joan</HI> Heir General of <HI>John Surrenden,</HI> and so became Possessor of <HI>Pluckley;</HI> but in this Name the Title was as volatile and mu∣table as in the former: for this man went out in Daughters and Co-heirs, one of them was wedded to <HI>Gouldwell,</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> the other was matched to <HI>John Dering</HI> Esquire, in whose Right he was entituled to the Signory of <HI>Pluckley.</HI> Now if you will inquire, where lay the ancient Land of <HI>Dering,</HI> if my Assertion might be cre∣dited, I should affirm, that it was at <HI>Stamford</HI> by <HI>Hieth,</HI> where they were Lords of some part of the little Mannot of <HI>Heyton:</HI> for by an old Roll, I find that <HI>Nor∣manus de Morinis,</HI> married <HI>Kineburga</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Deringus,</HI> and his Son as was Customary in those Times, called himself <HI>Deringus de Morinis,</HI> and matched with <HI>Elveva</HI> Sister and Heir of <HI>Alanus de Heyton,</HI> and so was invested in the Proprie∣ty of the Mannor of <HI>Heyton,</HI> from whom it successively came down to <HI>Richard Fitz Dering,</HI> who was Son of <HI>Dering,</HI> and great Grand-child to this man, who was the first who deserted the Sirname <HI>de Morinis,</HI> and assumed that of <HI>Dering,</HI> and died possest of the Mannor of <HI>Heyton,</HI> in the forty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. And from this <HI>Richard Fitz Dering</HI> is Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> Baronet, now lineally extracted, who is the instant Lord of <HI>Pluckley</HI> and <HI>Surrenden Dering,</HI> where Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> Knight and Baronet, not many years since deceased, raised that elegant Structure, as eminent for its Magnificence and Beauty, as it is for its Contrivance and Curio∣sity.</P>
<P><HI>Pevington</HI> was formerly a Parish, and had a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> though it be now languished into Dis-use, and grown an adjunct to <HI>Pluckley;</HI> The Patrons as well as Proprietaries of it were the <HI>Pevingtons,</HI> a Knightly Family, who borrowed their Sirname from hence. The first whom I meet with, is Sir <HI>Ralph de Pevington,</HI> who flourished here, in the raign of King <HI>John,</HI> and King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and was Father to Sir <HI>William de Pevington,</HI> who likewise died possest of this Mannor, in the fifty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, from whom descended <HI>John</HI> and <HI>William Pevington,</HI> who dying without Issue, in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Amabilia</HI> their Sister, matched to <HI>John Gobion,</HI> became their Heir, and she lies buried in the Church of <HI>Austin-Friars</HI> at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and is mentioned to have been a liberal Benefactresse to that Cloister, about the Time of her Decease, which was 1405. and had Issue by him <HI>Julian</HI> their only Daughter, who was about the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, matched to <HI>William Brent,</HI> from whom descended <HI>Thomas Brent,</HI> in whom the Name and Male-Line together was extin∣guished, so that <HI>Margaret Brent</HI> matched to <HI>John Dering,</HI> was the visible Heir of his Estate, amongst which this Mannor of <HI>Pevington,</HI> was enwrapped, which came down in Right of this Alliance to Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> Knight and Baronet, who up∣on his Decease gave it after the Death of his Mother, the Widow Dowager of Sir <HI>Anthony Dering,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Henry Dering,</HI> the eldest Son by his last Lady.</P>
<P><HI>Malmains</HI> in <HI>Pluckley,</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname. <HI>Elea∣nor</HI> Wife of <HI>John de Malmins</HI> died seised of it, in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 51. And after by Court-rols, I discover <HI>Henry Malmains</HI> to be possest of it, from whom it descended to <HI>Richard Malmains,</HI> who died (as the Date upon his Tomb-stone in <HI>Plukley</HI> Church discovers to us) in the year 1440. and left <HI>John Malmains</HI> his Heir, after whom I descry no farther mention of this Family; at this place: The next Family which succeeded in the Inheritance was <HI>Dering,</HI> not by any Right derived from <HI>Haut:</HI> for they had espoused the Heir of that Name before <HI>Malmains</HI> was extinguished: nor could it be by any Female Heir atchieved, for there were but two Co-heirs of this Branch of <HI>Malmains,</HI> who were wedded to <HI>Monins</HI> and <HI>Gouldwell.</HI> And if it be answered that <HI>Dering</HI> married the
<PB N="277" REF="146"/>Heir of the eldest House: To that I answer, that <HI>Nicholas Malmains,</HI> who was of the elder Line, deceased in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 15. and left only a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>William de Grandison:</HI> so that it is evident by the Premises, that this Mannor of <HI>Malmains</HI> devolved to <HI>Dering</HI> the instant Proprietary, not by any match of <HI>Haut,</HI> or of this Family it self, by any Female Heir or Coheir of <HI>Malmains,</HI> but by Purchase only.</P>
<P><HI>Shurland</HI> is the last place of Account: It hath been the Patrimony of <HI>Betenham</HI> of <HI>Be∣tenham</HI> in <HI>Cranbroke,</HI> for many Hundred years. <HI>Stephen de Betenham</HI> is mentioned in Court-rols, which take their Rise or Date from the Government of <HI>Hen,</HI> the third: and certainly this is that <HI>Stephen de Betenham,</HI> which is mentioned to be one of the <HI>Re∣cognitores Magnae Assisae,</HI> (an Office of very great Importance in elder Times) in those Pipe-rols, which relate to the raign of King <HI>John;</HI> and from this <HI>Stephen</HI> hath the Title of this place, by a constant and even Chain of Ages, threaded together into an unbroken Succession, come down to Mr. <HI>Betenham,</HI> who holds the present Sig∣nory and Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Plumsted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Lesnes,</HI> was in the year of Grace 960. given by King <HI>Edgar,</HI> to the Abbot and Convent of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> (as <HI>Thorne</HI> their Chronicler testifies) under the Notion of four ploughed Lands, which afterwards <HI>Godwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> violently tore from their Patrimony, and setled upon his Son <HI>Tostius:</HI> but it was restored to that Seminary by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, and remained fastned to their Revenue, until the rough hand of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by a publick suppression unlinked it, and then it was by that Prince, in the thirty sixth year of his raign, granted to Sir <HI>Edward Boughton</HI> of <HI>Burwash-court,</HI> from whom it is now devolved by Descent to his Successor Mr. ...... <HI>Boughton.</HI></P>
<P>The Abbot of St. <HI>Augustines,</HI> to adde more eminence to this Mannor, not only obtained a Charter of Free-warren to <HI>Plumsted,</HI> in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third; but likewise by Grant procured a Market to be held here weekly on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly three Dayes, at St. <HI>Nicolas, videlicet,</HI> the Eve, the Day, and Day after; both which were allowed before the Judges Itinerant, in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first.</P>
<P><HI>Plumsted</HI> had anciently Laws and Ordinances for the better securing the Mounds and Banks of the Mersh, against the Eruptions and Inundations of the Thames, which almost were of the same Resemblance and Complexion with those of <HI>Romney</HI> Mersh. A Scale of several Statutes, are delivered to us by <HI>Rastall</HI> in his Abridge∣ment, which concerned the Inning and preserving of <HI>Plumsted Level.</HI> The first was enacted in the twenty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, <HI>Cap.</HI> 3. and was printed. The second was made in the fourteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and was never printed. The third was ratified in the twenty third of Queen <HI>Elizabeth Cap.</HI> 13. and printed. The fourth and last was confirmed, in the twenty seventh year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth, Cap.</HI> 27. and likewise printed.</P>
<P><HI>Burwash-court</HI> is an eminent Seat in this Parish; made more illustrious by being wrapped up in the Revenue of the Noble Family of <HI>Burgherst</HI> or <HI>Burwash. Bartho∣lomew de Burgherst</HI> died possest of it, in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 38. And left it to his Son <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burwash,</HI> who in the forty third year of the above-said Prince, coveyed it with much other Land to Sir <HI>Walter de Paveley,</HI> Knight of the Garter, in which Family it continued, until the raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was alienated to <HI>VVilliam Chichley,</HI> Al∣derman of <HI>London,</HI> who left it to his Son <HI>John Chichley,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir <HI>Agnes,</HI> it came to be possest by <HI>John Tattershal</HI> of <HI>VVell-hall</HI> in <HI>Eltham:</HI> who about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, conveyed it to <HI>Boughton,</HI> in the Descendants of which Family, it had a permanent aboad, untill that Age that our Remembrance had an Aspect on, and then it was passed away to Mr. <HI>Rowland VVilson</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and he upon his late Decease, gave it to his Daughter and her Heirs, who was first matched to Doctour ...... <HI>Crisp,</HI> and now secondly to Colonel ...... <HI>Row</HI> of <HI>Hackney.</HI></P>

<P><HI>RAdigunds,</HI> vulgarly called the Abby of St. <HI>Radigunds,</HI> leads up the Van of this Register: It was founded by <HI>Hugh</HI> the first Abbot, who was before a Monk in the Priory of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> in the raign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> as the Book of <HI>Christ∣church,</HI> and the Return into the Court of Augmentation made in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, do both inform me. Their Rule was derived from <HI>Austin Bishop</HI> of <HI>Hippo,</HI> their Habit Black, whence they are sometimes styled Black-Canons, and sometimes Canons of St. <HI>Austins.</HI> The Revenue which appertained to this Cloi∣ster, lay not fat divided from this place, as namely at <HI>Alkham, Sotemore, Combe, Hawking, Padlesworth,</HI> and <HI>Pising,</HI> where they had a Mannor, as appears by an Inquisition, taken in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot.

This upon the Dissolution lapsing with all its Revenue to the Crown, King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, exchanged <HI>Pising</HI> with <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> but the Mannor of St. <HI>Radigunds</HI> it self, remained annexed to the Royal Revenue, until Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the thirty second year of her raign, granted it to <HI>Simon Edolph</HI> Esquire, descended from the <HI>Edolphs</HI> of <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> where they were very an∣cient, in whose Successor, Sir ...... <HI>Edolph,</HI> the propriety of this place is still re∣sident.</P>
<P><HI>Raculver</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>VVhitstaple,</HI> had a Monastery founded here, for Monks to live under the Rule of St. <HI>Bennet:</HI> But the Mannor it self was given with all its Train of Appendages, as namely, Pasture, Glebe, Mersh-land, and the adjacent Shore, and estimated at twenty five Mansions or Cottages, <HI>bis denis senisque estima∣tum Cassatis</HI> (those are the words of the Record by King <HI>Eadredus,</HI> in the year nine hundred forty and eight) to the Sea of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the presence of his Queen <HI>Edgiva,</HI> and Arch-bishop <HI>Odo:</HI> and if you will descry what Estimate it had in the Time of the Conqueror, <HI>Doomes-day</HI> Book will afford you a discovery. <HI>Raculf Tempore Edwardi Regis se defendebat pro</HI> VIII. <HI>Sullings, &amp; est appretiatum</HI> XL. <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> <HI>&amp;</HI> II. <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> V. s. <HI>tres Minutes</HI> (that was a Coin I believe equivalent to our now <HI>English</HI> Pence) <HI>minus.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Church be now full of Solitude, and languished into Decay; yet when <HI>Leland</HI> made his Perambulation, it was in a more splendid Equipage. If you please to hear him, he thus describes it; The old Building of the Abby Church, continues (says he) having two goodly spiring Steeples. In the entring into the Quire, is one of the fairest and most ancient Crosses, that ever I saw, nine Foot in height, it stan∣deth like a fair Columne. The <HI>Basis</HI> is a great stone, it is not wrought; the second Stone, being round, hath curiously wrought and and painted the Images of our Sa∣viour <HI>Christ, Peter, Paul, John</HI> and <HI>James; Christ</HI> saith <HI>Ego sum Alpha &amp; Omega; Peter</HI> saith <HI>Tu es Christus Filius Dei vivi.</HI> The sayings of the other three, were painted, <HI>Majusculis Literis Romanis,</HI> but now obliterated. The second Stone is of the Passion, The third Stone contains the Twelve Apostles. The fourth hath the Image of our Saviour hanging and fastned with four Nails, <HI>&amp; sub pedibus susten∣taculum:</HI> The highest part of the Pillar hath the Figure of a Crosse. In the Church is a very ancient Book of the Evangelies, <HI>in Majusculis Literis Romanis,</HI> and in the Borders thereof is a Crystal Stone, thus inscribed, <HI>Claudia Atepiccus.</HI> In the North-side of the Church, is the Figure of a Bishop painted under an Arch; In digging about the Church, they find old Buckles and Rings: The whole Print of the Monastery appears by the old Wall. And the Vicarage was made of the Ruines of the Monastery. There is a neglected Chappel out of the Church-yard, where some say was a Paroch-Church, before the Abby was suppressed, and given to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> Thus far he.</P>
<P>But the greatest Honor which in elder Times did accrew to this Village, was, that King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> after he had founded the Abby of St. <HI>Austins,</HI> removed his Residence from <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and fixed his Pallace at this place, which his Successors the Kings
<PB N="279" REF="147"/>of <HI>Kent,</HI> enobled by their presence; but when this Kingdome was swallowed up in that of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and <HI>Mercia</HI> afterwards in that of the West-<HI>Saxons;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reculver</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to it on the <HI>Thurs∣day,</HI> by <HI>William</HI> Arch-B. of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> in the 7th. of <HI>Edw.</HI> the se∣cond.</NOTE> this Mansion of theirs found a Sepulcher likewise in their Ruines; so that now we can trace it out no where, but in Annals and History, since even the very Ruines of the Ruines them∣selves, have now got an unknown enterment.</P>
<P><HI>Helburgh</HI> is an ancient Seat in this Parish: The first that I find possest it, was <HI>Ni∣cholas Tingewike,</HI> originally descended from <HI>Tingewick</HI> in the County of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and who likewise held large possessions at <HI>Dartford,</HI> and he dyed seised of it, in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

After this Family de∣serted the possession, the <HI>Pines</HI> became its Proprietaries, of which Family was <HI>James de la Pine,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the twenty sixth, and twenty seventh years of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and was in the possession of this place at his Decease, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

And left it to his Son <HI>Thomas Pine,</HI> after whom I meet with another <HI>James Pine,</HI> who about the Begin∣ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, passed it away to <HI>Cheyney,</HI> and in this Family did it reside, untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then the Lord <HI>Henry Cheyney,</HI> who then began to retail himself, and his estate out to Ruine in parcels, alienated this to <HI>Maycott,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Cavaliero Maycott,</HI> that eminent Courtier in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>James,</HI> in the entrance of that Prince into his Govern∣ment, passed it away to Sir <HI>Christopher Clive;</HI> and he immediately after, conveyed it away to <HI>Contry,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Cuntry,</HI> whose Son Mr. <HI>Thomas Contry,</HI> almost in our memory, cast it by Sale into the possession of Sir <HI>Edward Masters</HI> of <HI>Canterbu∣ry,</HI> whose Son <HI>Richard Masters</HI> Esquire, is entituled to the instant possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Reinham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> with <HI>Mere-court</HI> was, in the reign of <HI>H.</HI> the first, the patrimony of the noble Family of <HI>Camville. Robert de Camville,</HI> was engaged with <HI>Richard</HI> the first, at the Siege of <HI>Acon</HI> in <HI>Palestine. Robert de Camville</HI> his Son,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rot. pipae: de An.</HI> 41. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3.</NOTE> was an Assistant to <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the forty second of his Rule, when he marched from <HI>Chester</HI> against the <HI>Welsh. Geffrey de Camville</HI> was frequently summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. After this Family was worn out, the noble Family of <HI>Leybourn</HI> of <HI>Leybourn</HI> Castle, was entituled to the Inheritance. <HI>Henry de Leybourn,</HI> held it in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and so did <HI>Thomas de Leybourn,</HI> in the thirty fifth year of that Prince's Government, <HI>Rot.

And so did his Brother likewise, <HI>William de Leybourn,</HI> who held the grea∣test part of it at his Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; and transmitted it to his Kinsman <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> in whom the Male-line determined, and he left it in Dower to his Wife <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> who held it at her Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

And after her Decease, it was enstated on his and her Daughter and Heir <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> who for her vast Income, merited the Title of <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Kent;</HI> and she married for her first Husband <HI>Iohn de Hasting,</HI> a Kinsman of <HI>Laurence de Hasting:</HI> but he dyed without any Issue by her, upon whose Exit, she was espoused to <HI>William de Clinton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, who likewise deceased without any posterity by her, in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; after whose Decease she continued a Widow untill her Death, which was in the forty third year of the a∣bove-mentioned Prince, <HI>Rot. Ese. Num.</HI> 57. And is styled in the Escheat-roll <HI>Comitissa de Huntington,</HI> which fortifies the former Assertion, that she continued in the State of Widowhood, till her dissolution; upon whose decease, the Crown upon an exact and solemne Inquisition, discovering none that could inforce any Claim either directly and lineally, or else by collateral deduction, entitled it self to her estate, as legally es∣cheated: and that Prince, in the fiftieth year of his reign, grants it to the Abbey of St. <HI>Mary Grace</HI> on <HI>Tower-hill;</HI> where it was fixt, until it was by the Suppression, wrested away, and then K. <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, in the second year of his reign, granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and one of the Privy Councel to that Prince: whose Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> in the thirteenth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away by Sale to <HI>Samuel Thornhil</HI> Esquire, who upon his decease, gave it by Testament to his second Son Sir <HI>Iohn Thornhil</HI> not many years deceased,

<P><HI>Silham</HI> is a second place considerable.

And left them to his Son <HI>Iohn Donett,</HI> who likewise was in the possession of them at his Death, which was in the thirty sixth year of the above-named Prince; and had Issue <HI>Iohn Donett,</HI> in whom the Male-line failed, so that his Lands at <HI>Reinham,</HI> and <HI>Silham,</HI> devolved by <HI>Margery</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, to <HI>Iohn St. Leger</HI> Esquire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and was descended from <HI>Hugh St. Leger,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae,</HI> (an Office of a very great Latitude and Circumference of power in elder Times) in the second and seventh years of King <HI>Iohn.</HI> In the <HI>St. Legers,</HI> the possession of these places rested not long; for not long after that Interest which he had in <HI>Reinham,</HI> to <HI>Cheyney,</HI> and <HI>Silham</HI> to <HI>Bloer; Cheyney</HI> transmitted his Concernment, with that part of <HI>Reinham</HI> that rela∣ted to the Priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> to <HI>Sámuel Thornhill</HI> Esquire, who disposed of it upon his death, as is abovesaid: but <HI>Christopher Bloer,</HI> determined in <HI>Olympia Bloer,</HI> his Heir General, who brought it over to Mr. <HI>Iohn Tufton,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; from whom it is now come down, to the right honorable <HI>Iohn Tufton</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanett,</HI> who possesses the present Signory of it.</P>

<P><HI>Ripple</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Cornile,</HI> was a Mannor which alwayes related to the Abby of St. <HI>Austins,</HI> and was, in the Surrender of this Abby into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> eighth, in the twenty ninth year of that Prince, found to be involved in the De∣measne of that Covent, from whom it went over to the Crown, and remained there until Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the thirty second year of her Government, passed it away to Sir <HI>John Hall,</HI> who not long after alienated his Interest here to <HI>Gokin,</HI> in which Family the Propriety hath ever since continued.

<P><HI>River</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bewsborough,</HI> contains two remarkable places within the Boundaries of it. The first is <HI>Kersoney,</HI> which was the Inheritance of a Fa∣mily called <HI>Paganell,</HI> or more vulgarly <HI>Paynell. Isolda</HI> Wife of <HI>John Paynell,</HI> held it at her Death, which was in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second. In Times of a lower Descent, I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Phineux,</HI> the last of which Name at this Place was Sir <HI>John Phineux,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and he determining in Daughters and Co-heirs, <HI>Jane</HI> one of them, by matching with <HI>John Roper</HI> of St. <HI>Dunstans</HI> Esquire, made it the Patrimony of that Family, from whom in our Grand-fathers Remembrance, it was passed away to <HI>Best,</HI> Ancestor to Mr. ...... <HI>Best</HI> of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> Esquire, who is the instant Proprietary of it. The second is <HI>Archers</HI>-Court, which gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family so called; one <HI>Nicolas Archer</HI> held it in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and so did <HI>Thomas le Archer,</HI> in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left it to his Son <HI>William Archer,</HI> who paid respective <HI>Aide</HI> for his Lands here at <HI>River,</HI> and at <HI>Atterton,</HI> and <HI>Coperland,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight. From <HI>Archer</HI> it came to a Family called <HI>Baudrede,</HI> and continued divers years in this Name, un∣til in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, it was conveyed by Sale with <HI>Coperland</HI> to <HI>Thomas Doilie</HI> Esquire. Afterwards, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was ex∣changed with the Crown, and that Prince, in the thirty sixth year of his managing the <HI>English</HI> Scepter, granted it to Sir <HI>James Hales,</HI> in whose Family it remained un∣til almost that Time, which we entitle to our Fathers Remembrance, and then a part of it was passed away by Sale to <HI>Lee,</HI> but the other parcel continued constant to the Interest of <HI>Hales,</HI> until not many years since, not only that proportion, which was in the possession of <HI>Lee,</HI> but likewise that other above-mentioned, were both alienated by their respective Proprietaries to Sir <HI>Hardres Waller.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rodmersham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family, whose Sirname was <HI>Pine: John de la Pine</HI> enjoyed it, in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the
<PB N="283" REF="149"/>third, as appears by private Evidences, and so did <HI>James de la Pine</HI> his Grandchild, who deceased in the thirty seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>James de la Pine,</HI> a Child of nine years old, at his Fathers Exit; and he pre∣served it untill the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was transmitted by Sale to <HI>Podach,</HI> now called vulgarly <HI>Pordage,</HI> descended originally from <HI>John de Podach,</HI> who flourished as appears by an ancient Pedigree, relating to this Fami∣ly, in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and held Lands in the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> which bore his Name, and was called <HI>Podach;</HI> and from this above-mentioned <HI>Iohn,</HI> is Mr. <HI>Tho.

<P><HI>Pitstock</HI> in <HI>Rodmersham,</HI> is a little Mannor, which augmented the Revenue of the Nuns of <HI>Minster</HI> in <HI>Shepey,</HI> but when that ruinous Tempest broke forth in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which like an <HI>Hurricano</HI> tore up by the Roots the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, this was supplanted and thrown into the Demeasne of the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince, in the twenty ninth year of his Rule, granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> and his Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> about the thirteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated it to <HI>Samuel Thornhill</HI> Esquire, who upon his Decease, gave it to his second Son Sir <HI>Iohn Thornhill,</HI> from whom by descendant Right, it is now come over to his Son and Heir <HI>Charles Thornhill</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Newburgh</HI> is partly situated in <HI>Rodmersham,</HI> and partly in <HI>Lingsted,</HI> and anciently had the Estimate of a Mannor, and gave Name to a Family that was represented to the World, under that Notion, as appears, by very old Deeds without Date, in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Bartholomew May,</HI> too tedious here to recite. In the twenty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Isabell,</HI> Wife of <HI>Henry de Apulderfield,</HI> held it at her Death, and in the Copy of the Inquisition Roll, it is called <HI>Manerium de Newburgh:</HI> but in Ages of a more modern Complexion, it fell from its former Reputation, and by Disuse shrunk into Neglect and Contempt, and is now only eminent, in that it was involved in that Estate, that by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Coheir of Sir <HI>William Apulderfield</HI> devolved to Sir <HI>John Phineux,</HI> who finding his Sepulcher in Female Coheirs, <HI>Jane</HI> one of them, brought it over to her Husband <HI>John Roper</HI> Esquire, and from him by pa∣ternal Efflux, is the Title now wafted along, to the right honorable <HI>Christopher Roper,</HI> Baron of <HI>Tenham,</HI> removed by no wide Distance from this place.</P>
<P><HI>St. Johns</HI> is the last Mannor in <HI>Rodmersham,</HI> to be taken Notice of; though the First in its Degree of Eminence because it was a principal place belonging to the Knights Hospitallers. An Order that was established and instituted by <HI>Gerardus,</HI> but fenced in, and empaled with New Orders and Rules, by <HI>Raimundus a Podio,</HI> lest, debauched and softned by secular Interest, in Decursion of Time, they might have sallied out into some Disorder and Excesse. At their first Installment, they were to be eighteen years of Age, at least, and none who were without the Verge of that Time, were capable of this Order: they were to be neither of Jewish nor Turkish Extraction, lest they might seem tacitly to wrap up those principles in their Blood, which by their Vow, they were engaged to destroy. Their Pedigree or Genealogie, was to be wholly Christian, and that of no coorse, but of a more refined Temperament; for their Birth or Parentage was to be noble, and that not to be sullied with the impure Tincture of Bastardy. Yet even this Restriction had a gentler sense quilted into it, for if they were the Natural Sons of Princes, their Birth was enobled, and the Rigor of the Rule, was by so eminent a Descent softned and allayed, and they made capable of this Order. Then they were by a general Obligation, to defend the Sepulchre of <HI>Christ,</HI> to protect Pilgrims, against the Eruptions of Infidels, in their visits made to the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> to foment no Clandestine Animosities, by engaging in private Duells amongst them∣selves, which were blasted with the Black Character of Illegality; and if the Princes of Christedome were entangled in intestine Dissentions amongst themselves, they were to shroud themselves, under an impartial Neutrality, lest they might destroy
<PB N="284" REF="150"/>that Christianity, which by Oath they were obliged to assert, if they should embark in any impious Sidings, or partial Combinations. Lastly, they were abstracted by their Vow of Poverty, Chastity and Obedience, from all secular Employments, or Negotiations, lest the Fumes of Temporal Interest might cloud their Eyes, in their prospect towards the Sepulchre; in order to which, they were not to exercise any Mercantile Affairs, or the Designs of Usury; they were, if possible, to receive the Sacrament thrice every year, and if not interrupted to hear Masse once a day. I have now done with the Ingredients which made up their Vow, I shall now come to the form of their Installment.</P>
<P>As for the Method of their Investiture, it was cast into this Mould. They had a Sword delivered to them, intimating they should fight with Magnanimity; and this was guarded with a Crosse Hilt, to declare that they were in all Encounters to vindicate and maintain the Crosse and Sepulchre of our Saviour. Then they were struck thrice over the Shoulders with that Sword they were invested with, to insinuate, that they should sustain all Contumelies and Indignities, for the Cause and Defence of Christian Religion. Then fourthly, this Sword was wiped, to instruct them that their Lives were to be assoiled from the Spot of all open and scandalous Impieties. Fifthly, they had guilt Spurs placed upon their Heels, to shew first, that all temporal Im∣provement of Wealth, was to be cast behind the Designs of Piety and Religion; or secondly, to demonstrate, that Riches were but the Glosse, or Parjet, but Ho∣nor and Vertue, was the Solid Body, designed by the Spur it self, that was to support and sustain it. Sixthly, they had a lighted Taper put into their Hands, by that, to discover, that by an eminent Integritie and exemplar Piety, like the Irradiation of that Luminary, they were to make themselves conspicuous to those who were involved in the Mists and Umbrages of a dark and gloomy Infidelity. Lastly, after these Formalities performed, they were obliged to repair to Masse, where I leave them.</P>
<P>Their Customary Habit was a black Cloak, being the best Ensigne, or Symptome of a solemne external Sorrow, and on this was a <HI>Crosse potent between four Crosses Patee,</HI> designing the five wounds of our Saviour; they wore constantly when they appeared in publique, a red Belt, intimating they were at all times ready to bleed, in Defence of the Crosse and Sepulcher, and on that was fixed a white Crosse, to manifest the Purity and Innocence of that Cause and Religion which was con∣tended for.</P>
<P>This Order was first brought into <HI>England,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1100, by <HI>Jordan de Briset,</HI> in some old Deeds written <HI>Brinset,</HI> Lord of <HI>Well-hall</HI> at <HI>Eltham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Muriell</HI> his Wife, who founded a House for them at <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> and dedicated it to St. <HI>John,</HI> which afterwards became the Head of their <HI>Alberge</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> to which this Mannor continued united, as parcell of their Demeasne, untill the Dissolution in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, like a general Deluge, swept it away, and transported it into the Revenue of the Crown, and that Prince by Royal Con∣cession, made it the Estate of <HI>William Pordage</HI> Esquire, in whose Descendant, <HI>Thomas Pordage</HI> Esquire, the present Inheritance of it remains at this instant placed.</P>
<P><HI>Rochester</HI> is a City which in elder Times, was as eminent for its Antiquity, as it was for its Strength and Grandeur; and had not those violent Impressions, which the rough hand of War formerly defaced it with, demolished its Bulke, and discomposed its Beau∣ty, it peradventure might have been registred at this day in the Inventory of the prin∣cipal Cities of this Nation. It was governed by a Port Reve, until King <HI>Edw.</HI> the fourth, in the second year of his Reign, raised it into a higher Dignity, and decreed by his royal Grant, that it should thenceforth be governed by a Maior and twelve Aldermen, and to this Monarch does this City owe much of its present Felicity, a Prince certainly he was, full of Complacence and Benignity, of a munificent Mind, and an obliging accostable Nature, guilty onely of some humane Frailties, common to all, and adorned with many signal Virtues, scarce resident in any one, who did not voluntarily sail into that Sea of Blood, which was let loose in the Civil War, commenced between Him, and the Partisans of the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> but rather was driven into it, by the Tempest of his ill Fortune.</P>
<PB N="285" REF="150"/>
<P>Having represented the City in its Modern Face or Aspect, I shall now draw the Curtain something wider, and discover its Pourtracture in its calamitous Sufferings, occasioned by the Invasions, not only of an entaged Enemy, but likewise, which is worse, by the Onsets of its own incensed Prince; and these two mixing together have much disordered the Ancient Glory and Splendor of it.</P>
<P>In the year 680. <HI>Eldred</HI> King of <HI>Mercia</HI> harrassed <HI>Kent,</HI> and by an impetuous In∣road laid it wast. And as particular Lamentations are not distinguishable in universal Groans; so in this publick Depopulation of the County (then Kingdome,) the Tra∣gedy and Devastation acted by that Prince, at that Time, upon this City, was not resented with that Regret, as so deplorable Ruine might seem to exact, which had it been singly poured out upon this City, it could not have been repeated or re∣hearsed without a bleeding Heart, and a weeping Eye.</P>
<P>In the year 986. King <HI>Etheldred</HI> infested <HI>Rochester</HI> with a Siege, having entertain∣ed some discontent or disgust against the Bishop, and would not dissolve his Leaguer, until the said Bishop had expiated his Offence with the Sacrifice of an hundred pounds, a Sum of importance in those dry Times, though inconsiderable in these profuser ones of ours, where commonly the pecuniary Supply, that is extracted from the Subject, is steeped in his Tears.</P>
<P>In the year 999. the <HI>Danes</HI> invaded <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and though by the vigorous Re∣sistance and Magnanimity of the Defendants, their Assaults were made null, yet at length by the treacherous Combination of an insidious Party within, it was ra∣ther betrayed then subdued, and miserably depopulated by the Barbarous Adver∣sary, the Signatures of which Devastation are yet visible: and though the wideness of the Orifice, which that wound had made, be something closed up with the Hand of Time, yet there is a huge Scar left, to represent to Posterity the Greatness of the former Ruine. After they had thus harrassed and defaced that City, they (to improve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Victory) advanced to <HI>Rochester,</HI> where the Inhabitants astonished with an Example of so much Terror, after some faint Opposition against the <HI>Danish</HI> Im∣pressions and Onsets, gave themselves up to Flight, and this City to a Calamitous Depopulation.</P>
<P>In the year 1130. <HI>Henry</HI> the first, with the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> were pre∣sent at the Consecration of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Church in <HI>Rochester,</HI> which was then brought to perfection, having been before much empaired by the Iron Teeth of Time: But then the Fury of the Elements began to enter into a Corrivalship or Competition with the Fury of Enemies; for by a casual Eruption of an Accidental Fire, the whole City almost found an infortunate Sepulchre in its own Ashes: But it seems like a Phaenix, it rose again into new Beauty and Order out of these Ashes and Embers, but did not long continue in this Condition; for in the year of Grace 1177. which was in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, it was again assaulted by the Outrage and Fu∣ry of this implacable Element, the Impressions and remaining Signatures of which Conflagration, are obvious to the Inspection of an Inquisitive Eye, even until this Day.</P>
<P>In the year 1225. it was by the Indulgent Bounty of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in∣vested with a Wall, and that this Fortification might be of more Concernment, it was likewise secured or fenced with a Ditch.</P>
<P>In the year 1251. A Solemn Tornament was held at <HI>Rochester,</HI> wherein the <HI>English</HI> entered the Lists against those Strangers or Forrainers, (who having in that Age a great Concernment in the Eare of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, had likewise a strong In∣terest in his Heart, and by consequence a powerful Impression or Influence upon the publick Affairs of those Times) wherein they managed the Honor of this Nation, with so much Courage and Gallantry, that they forced them with Shame and Con∣fusion to retire into the City, and as if that were not a Shelter of sufficient Impor∣tance, to seek for their Security in the Castle.</P>

<HEAD>The Castle.</HEAD>
<P>THat there was in the Age before the <HI>Norman</HI> Invasion, the Rudiments, or, if I may so say, the <HI>Embrio</HI> of a Castle represented to the World under imperfect Lineaments or Dimensions, here at <HI>Rochester,</HI> is most certain; For the Records of the Cathedral inform us, that <HI>Egbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the year 763. gave cer∣tain Lands to <HI>Eardulfe,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> situate within the Wals of the Castle of that City, which argues that there was some Trench or Fortification, even in those Times, which was in Strength by the Analogy of Proportion equivalent to the Fortresses of that Age, and so might merit by Resemblance the Name of a Castle, though the Bulk and Grandeur of it was added in Times of a more Modern extraction: For in the Time of the Conquest, I find that the Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI> received Land at <HI>Alresford</HI> for Land at <HI>Rochester</HI> proportionate to it to erect a Castle on, which was in all probability, onely to enlarge the Boundaries of the old one, which peradventure was thought too contemptible in those active Times, to secure so important a Pass, as this of <HI>Rochester,</HI> was, without the Additional Supply of some new Strength. And that these Augmentations did acknowledge, if not for their Founder or Author, yet at least for their eminent Benefactor, <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bajeux,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> half Brother to the Conqueror, is without Controversie; a man who was afterwards dignified and adorned with the Office of Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> a place of the most eminent Trust in that Age, and which was often managed by the Kings of <HI>England</HI> personally themselves, and from the Marble Seat in <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> did deliver their Decisions and Determinations of Law, from whence in Ancient Seals and other Sculptures, they are often represented to us sitting in Judicature upon this Marble Seat, and hence result those Customary Ex∣pressions in Original Writs, and other Processes, <HI>Coram Nobis,</HI> and, <HI>Teste Rege,</HI> and sometimes, <HI>me Ipso apud Westmon.</HI> and some other Phrases and Tearms in our Ancient Law-books of the same Complexion, as namely such a one, <HI>Allocutus est Nobis sedentibus supra Sedem Marmoream:</HI> which justifies that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> did sometimes personally sit and assist in Judicature, in that Court we now call the Upper Bench, where like a great Orb or Glob of Light, they dispersed their Beams of Mercy and Justice into all the parts of our <HI>English Horizon,</HI> and dispelled all those Crievances, which, like so many Fogs or Clouds exhaled from corrupred Nature, seemed to eclipse the Serenity of this Nation. But I wander too much; I now return. This Accumulation of Offices and Dignities, could not so ingage this above∣mentioned <HI>Odo,</HI> to the Interest of <HI>William Rufus</HI> his Nephew; but that he first en∣wrapped himself in a Combination with some of the discontented Nobility, whose Endeavors were to ravish the Scepter out of the Hand of that Prince, and place it in the hand of <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> his eldest Brother, and afterwards to fortifie this De∣sign, started out into an open Defection and seised upon this Castle of <HI>Rochester:</HI> but <HI>William Rufus</HI> with so much Expedition and Courage crushed these Attempts, that they became abortive: for in the year 1088. he besieges his Uncle <HI>Odo</HI> in this Fortress, and presses upon him with so much Vigor and Animosity, that he forces him to surrender to discretion, but though he took not away his Life, he did that of his Liberty, and sent him Prisoner to <HI>Tunbridge-castle,</HI> not under the Notion of Bishop of <HI>Bajeux;</HI> for that would have infringed and invaded the Franchises of the Church, but under that of the Earl of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>After this there was by the mediation and umpirage of <HI>Robert Fitz Hamon,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> a Composition made between <HI>William Rufus</HI> and <HI>Gundulphus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> the Result of which was this: The Prince was to confirm the Mannor of <HI>Hedenham</HI> to this Sea, and the Bishop, to ballance this Concession with something which had the Face of Retribution, was to expend sixty pound, in some additions to the Castle, and accordingly erected the great square Tower, a Mor∣sel which hath been too hard for the Teeth of Time, and by the vastness of the in∣stant remaining Skeleton, witnesses the strength of it to Posterity, when it was in
<PB N="287" REF="151"/>its primitive Grandeur, before the Rage of War, and the Fury of Elements threw it into this wild Disorder and Confusion; yet it is even in this shattered Condition, a better Alphabet to the Memory of the Bishop its first Founder, then his own Mo∣nument or Repository, for that lies entered in forgotten and neglected Ruines, but this still preserves his Name, and is called <HI>Gundulphus's</HI> Tower.</P>
<P>And being thus improved and fortified, with these new Accessions, it is not to be wondered at, that this Piece, was of that signal Estimate, in elder Times, that King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, by the Advice of his Councel, in the year 1126, granted the Custody of this Castle, and the Office of Castellan, annexed to it, to <HI>William</HI> the then present Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and his Successors, with free liberty to erect a Tower, that is another Fortresse, equivalent or Correspondent to <HI>Gundulphs</HI> Tower, which before was erected for the Defence of this City and Castle.</P>
<P>In Times succeeding to these, that is, in the year 1215, <HI>William de Albineto</HI> or <HI>Al∣biniaco,</HI> in the Latine of those Times, and written <HI>D' Albinet,</HI> in the Usage of ours, was Governour of this Fortresse, for the factious party of the mutinous Barons, who were then in actual Arms against King <HI>John,</HI> but this Prince invested it with a formal Leaguer, and after the bloody Debate of a three Moneths Siege, forces the above-mentioned <HI>D' Albinet</HI> to a Surrender, wherein though the Virtue of the Op∣ponent, was considerable, yet it was ruinous to him, and the Event hath left us Faith enough to believe, that Strength without the Concurrence of a Loyal Prin∣ciple which may support it, is like an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Reed, which ordinarily runs into the Fingers, and wounds them which lean upon it.</P>
<P>In the year after this, the Nobility, then combined and in Arms against King <HI>John,</HI> finding that their Forces were much empaired and diminished by severall un∣succesful Encounters with that Prince, and that they must be forced to resign them∣selves up to those rigorous Conditions that he would impose upon them, called in <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dolphin</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who landing in the Isle of <HI>Thanett,</HI> with a considerable Army, advanced to <HI>Rochester,</HI> and by the concurrent Assistance of the Barons, who had united their strength with his, made such a furious Onset upon this Castle, that like a Tempest which bears down all before it, he carried it by Assault.</P>
<P>In the year 1264. broke out that fatal Contest between <HI>Simon Montfort</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Foundation or Original of which was this. That Earl being the great Assertor of the <HI>English</HI> Liberty against the turbulent Eruptions of Forrainers, endeavoured to tear away those Strangers, that being placed too near the Royal Throne, had obstructed and forelaid all the Avenues and Passages both to the Heart and Eare of that Prince: and this dismal clashing (like the Collision of two Flints) was productive of so wasting and destructive a Fire, that it had like, not only to have consumed the Crown and Scepter, but likewise to have cast the whole Kingdome it self into a heap of Flame and Ruines, some Sparks of which were dart∣ed hither. For this Earl about the Time above specified begirt the City and Castle of <HI>Rochester,</HI> with a powerful Army, and that he might multiply all Advantages to himself, which might inforce his Design, and intercept the Succour intended the Besieged, he burned the Bridge, whose Frame was then made up of Wood, and destroyed a Fortress that was placed upon it, which was compounded of the same Materials, and having effected this, he pressed so hard upon the Castle, that he not only pillaged the adjacent Church and Abby, but likewise subdued the outward Ward or Gate, and had certainly by an absolute Conquest at chieved the whole, had not King <HI>Henry</HI> arrived most opportunely, and by a succesful encounter wrested both Earl <HI>Warren,</HI> who had so vigorously maintained it, and that likewise, from the Im∣pressions of his Fury.</P>
<P>After this, I find little of Moment to have been acted at this place, only I find the Castle to have been deposited in the Hands of several eminent Persons, who were extracted from Families, whose Blood was of as noble a Tincture as any in this County, and these held it under the Notion of <HI>Castellani</HI> or Guardians of it, an Office of a very important Concernment in elder Times. The first of which, who was entrusted with it, was <HI>William St. Clere,</HI> whose Ancient Seat, before his Suc∣cessor by the Match of the Coheir of <HI>Aldham</HI> removed to <HI>Ightam,</HI> was at <HI>Woodland</HI> in <HI>Kingsdown,</HI> and he died in the Tenure of this place, in the forty eighth year of
<PB N="288" REF="152"/><HI>Henry</HI> the third. After him, I discover <HI>Robert de Hougham</HI> Lord of <HI>Hougham</HI> by <HI>Dover,</HI> to have had the Custody of it, and he died invested in this Office, in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and in the next year after <HI>Robert de Septuans,</HI> from whom the <HI>Harfleets</HI> of <HI>East-Kent</HI> are descended, had the Care and Command of it. In Times of a nearer Approach to us, I find <HI>William Keriel</HI> or <HI>Criol,</HI> was entrusted with the Care and Government of it, and was possest of this Charge at his Death, in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth. After whose <HI>Exit,</HI> the Custody was committed to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and he held it at his Decease, which was in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth. But after this, it began so to languish away into its own Ruines, that it grew rather an Object of Pity, than of Envy, and rested amongst the Mannors of the Crown, untill King <HI>James,</HI> in the seventh year of his Reign, granted that goodly Skeleton of the Castle, which yet courts the Eye of the Beholder, to an Admiration of its former Strength, with all the Services annexed to it, to Sir <HI>Anthony Weldon,</HI> of <HI>Swanscamp,</HI> whose Son and Heir <HI>Ralph Weldon</HI> of <HI>Swanscamp</HI> Esquire, is the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>There is much Land in this County held of this Castle, whose Tenure is perfect Castleguard: for upon the Day prefixed for the discharge of the quitt-Rent, relating to it, there is a Banner displaid and hung out (anciently it was over the Castle-Wall) and all those who are Tenants to this Mannor, and are in Default by their non-Appearance, and do not discharge their Customary Duties, and Services, the Penaltie imposed up∣on their Neglect, is, that the Return of every Tide of the adjacent River which finds them Absent, doubles their Service or quitt-Rent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bridge</HI> which is almost contiguous to the Root or Basis, was anciently, when the Frame was of Timber, removed to a farther Distance, and crossed the Stream, over against the Hospital of St <HI>Maries,</HI> at <HI>Stroude.</HI> But this was by <HI>Simon de Montfort</HI> when he besieged <HI>Rochester,</HI> ruined by Fire, and although it was re-edified and repai∣red not long after, yet some twenty years subsequent to this Misfortune, it was swept away by Ice, so that it appears the Elements entered into a Corrivalship or Compe∣tition, which should make the most ruinous Impression, on this infortunate Structure.</P>
<P>But after this, that is, in the raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, all those above-men∣tioned Dysasters and Inconveniences, which might again have assaulted the <HI>Bridge,</HI> were for the future prevented; for Sir <HI>Robert Knolles,</HI> a Person who had improved, and enhaunsed his Fame, to the highest Degree of Eminence, by his glorious and succes∣full Managery of the English Affairs, and Interest in <HI>France,</HI> seeking to make him∣self as usefull to his Friends, that is, his Contrymen, as he was before considerable to his Enemies, mastered the Course of the River, and somewhat nearer to the Castle as in a place more fit, both for the Soliditie, and fastnesse of the Soile, as likewise for the breaking of the impetuousnesse of the Current, erected the Bridge of Stone which is now visible, fixed, and established on one and twenty Arches, and by this Victory over the Elements, made his Triumphs more illustrious, than he had done before, by all the Conquests of his Adversaries: for in these he only seemed to have out-gone all others, but in this, to have outdone himself.</P>
<P>Being thus fixed and Strengthned, there was a Statute enacted in the one and twen∣tieth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, wherein there is Provision made for its future Securi∣ty, there being several parcells of Land, which are mentioned in that Act, tied and obliged for its continual Maintenance and Repair, whensoever the Injuries of Time, or those of the Elements, should deface or impair it.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>The Chappel or Chantry in old Records, styled the Chantry of <HI>Rochester</HI> Bridge, was founded in the year 1399, by <HI>Iohn de Cobham,</HI> and was dedicated to the holy Trinity, and was called at the first Institution, <HI>All Souls</HI> Chappel, because Prayers and other Orizons, were there to be offered up, for the Redemption and Health of all Christian Souls, and likewise a Stipend or Exhibition was there setled, for the Support and Maintenance of three Priests, or Chaplains, particularly, to pray for the Souls of <HI>John de Cobham</HI> the Patron and Founder, Sir <HI>Robert Knolles,</HI> to whom the Bridge owed its primitive Establishment, <HI>William Wangford</HI> and <HI>Eleanor</HI> his Wife, <HI>Iohn Fre∣mingham</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> his Wife, <HI>William Makenade,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Rickhil;</HI> and likewise for the Souls of some who were deceased before the Foundation of this Chappel, as
<PB N="289" REF="152"/>namely for the Soul of <HI>Iohn Buckingham,</HI> formerly Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Wall worth,</HI> the eminent Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> to whose Virtue and Valour, <HI>London,</HI> owes the Addition of the Dagger, which was annexed as an Augmentation to the Arms of the City.</P>
<P>The Priory was founded by <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> and dedicated to the Honor of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and stored with Monks who were to live under the Rule of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> though afterwards, as Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> out of the Book of <HI>Rochester</HI> observes, they altered their Rule, and conformed themselves to the Canon of St. <HI>Augustine</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hippo,</HI> but were reduced again to the primitive Institution of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> in the year 1080, by <HI>Gundulphus</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> in which Design, he was aided and supported by <HI>Lanfranc</HI> the active Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> In Ages of an elder Inscription, there were several Contests brake forth between the Monks of <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and those of this Covent; the first Strugling, to bring the Election of the Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI> into their Chapiter, which the last, Sticking close to their own inherent Rights and Priviledges, endevoured to disannul, and wholly to circum∣scribe his Election within the Precincts of their own Chapiter. Two Presidents, which represent to Posterity the whole State of this Controversie, do occur in Record. The first appears in the year 1227, when after the Death of <HI>Benedict,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> elected to succeed him, <HI>Henry Sandford,</HI> a Man of exemplary Piety, so that he was inculpable for his Life, and of unfathomed Learning, so that he was in that Age, almost unparallelled for his Knowledge, which could not stave off the Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> to justle the Election, pretending that the pastoral Staffe or Crosier of <HI>Rochester, de Jure,</HI> ought to have been brought to their House, after the Decease of the Bishop, and that the Election was to have been made in their Chapiter. This occasioned much Heat, for the Monks of <HI>Rochester,</HI> vigorously asserted their own Choice, so that it was referred to the Decision of the Arch∣bishop, and he again put it over to the Umpirage of Delegates, who hearing the parties concerned, and poising the Allegations, produced by either side to sustain the Justice of their own Cause; they by a finall Determination, declared the Right to reside in the Monks of <HI>Rochester.</HI> But it seems this Fire, was only allayed, not extinguished: for in the year 1238, it brake forth again, and the occasion which gave Fuell to it, was this. The Monks of <HI>Rochester,</HI> had elected <HI>Richard Wendover</HI> for their Bishop, which so exasperated and disgusted the Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> that suspecting their own Power, they, more to inforce and mul∣tiply their Strength, and evacuate that Election, entituled Arch-bishop <HI>Edmund</HI> to their Cause. But the Monks of <HI>Rochester</HI> disclaiming, by a tame Remissenesse, either to foment or palliate their own undoing, appealed to <HI>Rome,</HI> where af∣ter the chargeable Commencement of a three years Sute, the Innocency and Justice of their Cause was recompensed with the Triumph of the Day, upon which they returned home exalted with the Joy of their Successe, and enacted in their Chapiter, that the annuall Feast of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> on which Day they archie∣ved this signal Conquest, should be doubly solemnized, both in their Church and in their Kitchin. But as they were successefull in their rancounters with the Arch-bishop, so they were very infortunate in that intestine Discord, which burst out between them, and their own Bishop <HI>Gilbert Glanville;</HI> who not only forcibly wrung from them their Goods, Ornaments, Writings, and other Muniments, but likewise devested them of a considerable Portion of their Lands, Possessions, and Priviledges, which forced them to appeal to <HI>Rome</HI> for Redresse; where they em∣broiled themselves in a tedious Law-Sute, which engaged them to that vast ex∣pence, that they were constrained to coin the Silver of <HI>Paulinus</HI> Shrine into Money, to support them in so expensive and costly a Contest; and this much embased for the fu∣ture that Esteem which the World formerly had entertained both of the Piety and Sanctitie of the Monks of this Cloister.</P>
<P>But these Contests did not so much prejudice or endamage this Cloister within, though accompanied with much Heat, as the Devastation occasioned by the Ele∣ment of Fire without: for in the year 1130. when <HI>Henry</HI> the first, with a great Convention of the Nobility and Bishops was then present to solemnize the Conse∣cration of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Cathedral and Church, which was then newly finished, a
<PB N="290" REF="153"/>suddain Flame broke out, whose Assaults upon this Covent, did much deface and empare the Glory of the Ancient Fabrick. And as if this impetuous Eruption had not been enough to diminish the Beauty of it, there was another Fire in the year 1177. which was about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, which exercised its Fury upon it, even to a total Depopulation of this Cloister; yet after all these Disasters, wherein it is disputable, whether the Rage of men, or that of the Elements, were more destructive, by the Charitable Beneficence and Piety of that Age, it arose like a Phaenix, more Beautiful and vigorous, even out of its Embers and Ashes, and continued in that condition, until the general Dissolution, in the reign of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the eighth, and then that Prince having suppressed this Covent, and torn off their Revenue, upon their Ruines he established a Dean and twelve Prebends, and endowed them for their future support with that Demeasne, which for the princi∣pal part of it, as namely, <HI>Wouldham, Halling, Snodland, Trottescliff, Denton, Longfeild, Borestal, Lidsing,</HI> and <HI>Stoke,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> had been formerly annexed to the above-mentioned Cloister.</P>
<P>The Cathedral, with the Bishoprick of <HI>Rochester,</HI> united to it, were founded and established by that pious Monarch <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> and the first Bishop to whom was entrusted the Pastoral Staffe or Crosier by <HI>Augustine,</HI> the Apostle of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> was <HI>Justus,</HI> the above-mentioned Prince, not only assenting unto this Election by his Presence, but likewise contributing to the Support of the Person so chosen, and his Successors by his liberal Beneficence. And indeed it is remarka∣ble, that in all those Revolutions and Vicissitudes, which have rolled and varied the Fate of things and Affairs, since the Seeds of Christianity were sown so plenti∣fully by the Hand of <HI>Augustine</HI> in this Island, that the Chair of this Bishoprick was still fixed at <HI>Rochester,</HI> whereas many others have in sundry parts of the Nation suffered divers Translations to other places then that where they at first were esta∣blished; and the Reason is, because by the Order of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, such Bishops as were before resident in Towns and Villages, were forthwith to transplant their Seat into walled Cities and places of Defence, the more to oblige the popu∣lacie, not only to repair thither for the Exercise of Devotion, but likewise to augment the Commerce and Bulk of those Cities, by such numerous Assemblies; but in this Command of his, <HI>Rochester</HI> could not be interressed or concerned, that was invested with a Wall, or something equivalent to it long before the Age of the Conqueror. I should now unfold a Catalogue of those Bishops that swayed the Cro∣sier of this Sea, beginning with <HI>Justus,</HI> and concluding with <HI>John Warner</HI> the in∣stant Bishop of this Diocess; but this is so obvious, both in <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and a late Manual, styled <HI>The Help to History,</HI> that I shall only historically Record the most eminent of them, and proceed. The first of whom I find to be <HI>Justus,</HI> who was translated from this Sea, to that of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> a Man whose Integrity of Life breathed out a noble perfume when he was living, and his Body, if we may credit the Fabulous and Superstitious Legend of that Age, no less grateful an Odour when he was Dead, for 'tis reported that his Reliques being to be removed after their En∣terment many years before, cast forth (not the Stench or Steam of Putrefaction) but a Sent so odorous and fragrant, that it did not annoy, but exceedingly delight the Nosthrils of those who were present; but indeed this might be possible without the Concurrence of a Miracle, if we consider that those Remains of his might be rescued from the Fate of Corruption, by the Adjuncts or Circumstances of Nard, Balm, Spicery, and Perfume; so that the Miracle seems to be imposed by the Monks on the Laity of that Age, only to excite both their Devotion and Benevo∣lence.</P>
<P><HI>Paulinus,</HI> who was the third Bishop, who succeeded him, converted <HI>Edwin</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Edelburga</HI> his Queen, to Christianity, and so justly meri∣ted the Title of Apostle of that Province, for which he was recorded after his Death in the Register of Saints, and had his Body so far ennobled, that it was wrapt up in a silver Shrine.</P>
<P><HI>Ithamar,</HI> who next succeeded him, had his Reliques likewise enshrined in after Times by <HI>Gandulphus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> which was not only repaired, but very much adorned and beautified by Bishop <HI>John</HI> his Successor, because (as the Book of
<PB N="291" REF="153"/><HI>Rochester</HI> intimates, he was redeemed, by touching his Reliques, <HI>ab acerrimo Oculo∣rum Dolore,</HI> from some sharp Distillation which did afflict his Eye.</P>
<P><HI>Arnostus</HI> was present at <HI>Pinenden-heath,</HI> at the great Debate touching some Lands, which were unjustly ravished away from the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Gundulphus</HI> his Successor erected the white Tower in <HI>Rochester-castle:</HI> and where∣as he at his first Instalment, found but six Canons in the Covent of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> he so liberally endowed it, that he left it replenished with threescore Monks of the Order and Rule of St. <HI>Benedict.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tobias,</HI> whom I should have mentioned after <HI>Ithamar,</HI> was (as <HI>Harp feild</HI> out of the <HI>Records</HI> of <HI>Rochester</HI>) a man very dextrous and skilful in the Tongues, and a gene∣ral Magazine of all other Learning both Divine and Humane beside.</P>
<P><HI>Walter de Merton,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> did not only found the Colledge of <HI>Merton</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> but likewise laid the Foundation of an imperfect Colledge at <HI>Maldon</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> which by his Death was left unfinished. He died in the year 1277. and lies buried in his own Church at <HI>Rochester,</HI> to which in his Life Time he had been a Munificent Benefactor. In Gratitude to whose Memory Sir <HI>Henry Savil,</HI> and the Fellows of <HI>Merton</HI> Colledge, erected a Magnificent Monument, in the year 1599. over his Ashes, which though it be much empaired both by Age, and the in∣jurious Affronts of these impious Times; yet shall the Name of this great man be the best Steward to his own Dust: and when his Sepulchre it self shall lie enterred in its own deplored Rubbish, this shall stand unto it self an everlasting Tomb and Epitaph.</P>
<P><HI>Hamon de Heath</HI> was Confessor to <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and a liberal Benefactor to this Church; He built the House at the Mannor of <HI>Halling,</HI> which in some Ancient Records is styled his Pallace.</P>
<P><HI>Joannes de Scapeia,</HI> or <HI>John de Shepey</HI> was Lord Treasurer of <HI>England</HI> three years.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Young</HI> was a principal Contributor to the Reparation of the Church at <HI>Frendsbury,</HI> and wholly glazed the Windows: where not long since his pourtracture was exposed to the publick View; a good Index, not only to his Memory, but like∣wise to the Remembrance of so pious a Work.</P>
<P><HI>John Lowe</HI> was born in the County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and was a man in the Estimate of <HI>Bale,</HI> who writ his Life, not only of signal Piety, but likewise an Exchequer of all manner of Learning.</P>
<P><HI>John Fisher</HI> was a man of vast Knowledge, which yet was Ruinous to him for as∣serting the Papal Supremacy, when it was invested in <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, by an Act of Parliament; he offered up his Life on a Scaffold, as a Sacrifice to that opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Nicolas Ridley</HI> was a man of an inculpable Life, and of a wide Knowledge, who was so an irrefragable Assertor of the Protestant Religion, that he gave himself up at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to the Fury of Fire and Faggot for the Testimony of what he before had professed: and hath by his exemplary Life and Death, taught the Adversaries of Episcopacy this Lesson, that it is possible that the Seed may be pure as well as the Soyl; that is, the persons of the Men, as well as the Office, may be incorrupt.</P>
<P><HI>John Warner</HI> is the last, who brings up this Catalogue, in whom the instant Title of this Bishoprick is resident, a man worthy of better Dayes, yet fit for these; who for his vast Encouragement of Learning in the best of Times, and his pious Support of it in the worst, cannot be mentioned without an Attribute.</P>
<P>There have in elder Times many Contests and Animosities broke out between the Bishops of <HI>Rochester</HI> and <HI>Worcester;</HI> and the Fuel which fomented and supplied this Fire of Contention, was, that both these Prelates pretended to the Support of the Crosier before the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in all Processions, and other Acts of publick and signal Solemnity; but in Fine, the Crosier or Pastoral Staff was fixed or setled in the Hand of the Prelate of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and hath been by Prescription ever since united as a convicted and Inherent Priviledge to this Diocesse.</P>
<P>Before I wave my Discourse concerning this Bishoprick, I must inform the Read∣er, that there are some peculiars which are annexed to the Deanries of <HI>Croydon</HI> and <HI>Shorham,</HI> and this hath entangled and engaged many in much Difficulty to trace out the last Wils and Testaments of those who deceased within the Confines and Pre∣cincts
<PB N="292" REF="154"/>of these peculiars. To unravel therefore these Niceties for the future; I shall represent a just Scale of these excepted places, out of the original Records of the Church of <HI>Rochester</HI> themselves, that those which can find no satisfaction in the Registers of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> or Records of <HI>Rochester,</HI> may yet discover what they are in pursuit of, in that Office, wherein these are enrolled and filed. But before I unwind their Catalogue, I shall in brief wrap up what in former Times hath been delivered touching the Office of Rural Deans, by <HI>Duarenus</HI> and others, who have more co∣piously dilated themselves upon this Subject. This Officer was certainly brought into the Church to supply the place of those whom Antiquity styled the <HI>Chore-Episcopi,</HI> who were commonly Assistants to the Bishop: For indeed where the Diocesse was of that vast Latitude and Extent, that the Managery of so great a Trust was dispro∣portionate to the Discharge of one single Person, it was necessary that his Care should be supported by the mutual Counsel and concurrent Advice of others, whose prudence might improve the Affairs of the Church: and upon the going out of the above-mentioned Office, as being obsolete and antiquated, this of the Rural Dean came in. And to him did the Bishop entrust an Inspection into the Lives of the Clergy, and from him did receive an exact Account of Scandal in its whole Lati∣tude, and other vitious Excesses, which might by an impious Connivance have ad∣ded more blackness to the Cassock: He was likewise, by Delegation from the Bishop, to take Cognisance of all Errors and Deviations from that which in that Age was re∣puted Orthodox Doctrine, that neither the Foundation nor Superstructure of Reli∣gion might be assaulted. And lastly, where the Diocesse was wide, and of a large Territory, it frequently hapned that the Probate and Administration of sundry Te∣staments in divers places, was committed to his Care and Sway; and he was like∣wise entrusted with a Seal, with the Name of the Bishop, whose Office by Depu∣tation he was to discharge, and not his own, insculped upon it: which upon his Decease, or relinquishing this Office, was to be surrendered up into the Hands of the Bishop of the Diocesse for the Time being, that he might dispose of it as he should judge convenient.

<P>Having done with the Church, I shall now descend to those Mannors which lie circumscribed within the Precincts and Verge of this City. The first is <HI>Borestall,</HI> which, as <HI>Textus Roffensis</HI> denotes and signifies unto us, was given to the Church and Monks of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> by <HI>Kenulfus</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and was, as the Records of that Church testifie, <HI>de Cibo eorum,</HI> to support their Table with a constant supply of Diet, and rested annexed to their Demeasne, until the Fatality of the General Dissolution ravished it away, and afterwards it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, when he established a Dean and Chapiter upon the Ruines of this above-mentioned Priory, linked unto that Revenue, which he granted them for their future subsistence.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Great Delce,</HI> which had owners of that Sirname, as is evident by <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> and other Records both of a publick and private Stamp; but, it appears, was not of any permanent continuance in this Name: for before the middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, it was gon from that, and united to the Inheritance of <HI>Has∣pall.
<PB N="293" REF="154"/>Geffrey de Haspall,</HI> enjoyed it at his Death under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, as appears by an Inquisition, taken in the fifteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 25. The next Family in Succession after this, which was entitu∣led to the Possession (as is evident by the original Deeds, now in the Hands of <HI>Lea</HI>) was <HI>Molineux,</HI> derived from those of <HI>Sefton</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> but he remained so incon∣siderable a Space in the Inheritance, that like <HI>Cato</HI> in the <HI>Theater,</HI> he only stept into it, that he might go out again; for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the testimony of an ancient Court-roll, <HI>Benedict de Fulsham,</HI> was invested in the Patrimony of it in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 20. And from him, did it streame down in the Channel of successive Interest, to his Des∣cendant <HI>Richard Fulsham,</HI> who likewise was in the Enjoyment of it at his Decease, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Rot Esc. Num.</HI> 17. But after his <HI>Exit,</HI> I find no farther mention of any of this Family, to have been possest of this place; for, in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Reginald Love,</HI> died seised of it, and transmitted it to his Successor, who held it untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then the Revolution of Purchase, brought it to be the Demeasne of <HI>William Venour,</HI> and it was found to be his Possession at his Death, which was in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 24. But after his Depar∣ture, the Title was very unsetled and inconstant; for within the Circle of some Moneths after, it was by Sale from this Name, rolled into the Tenure of <HI>Markham</HI> descended from the ancient Stem of the <HI>Markhams,</HI> of <HI>Nottingham-shire,</HI> where after a very transitory aboad, it was by the same Fatality, carried into the Pos∣session of <HI>Tate;</HI> who about the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, passed it away to Sir <HI>Richard Lea,</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> descended from an ancient Family of that Name, in the County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and his Son was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the nineteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and held his Shrievalty at his new acqui∣red Mannor of <HI>Much Delce,</HI> and from him by an even thread of Descent, has the Title and Propriety been conducted down to <HI>Richard Lea</HI> Esquire, who is the instant Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Horsted</HI> borrows its Name from <HI>Horsa,</HI> Brother to <HI>Hengist</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Sax∣on Kingdome</HI> here in <HI>Kent,</HI> who fell by the Sword of the Britons at <HI>Alresford,</HI> as an expiatory Sacrifice, to ballance the Losse of <HI>Cartigerne,</HI> Brother to <HI>Vortimer,</HI> General of the Confederate British Forces, who was offered up in that signal Encounter, as an <HI>Holocaust</HI> to the Saxon Fury; and there is something, which even at this Day, lies wrapt up in the Name, that induces us to believe, that <HI>Horsa</HI> after his slaugh∣ter, recieved the Rites of his Funeral at this place; and in our Grandfathers Me∣mory, there were the scattered Remains of diverse huge Massie Stones, which Storms and other Impressions of Time, have now altogether demolished: and these certainly were, in elder Times, composed into the Figure of a Monument, to shroud the Ashes of this <HI>Horsa;</HI> as those at <HI>Cits Cothouse,</HI> above <HI>Alresford,</HI> were framed in∣to the same Proportionate Mould, to secure the Dust, or at least to point out to Posterity the Memory of <HI>Cartigern.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor it self, was enwraped in the Patrimony of the noble and ancient Fa∣mily of <HI>Apulderfield. William de Apulderfield,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <HI>Horsted,</HI> in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth. In Times of a lower Descent, I discover it in the Possession of <HI>Warren;</HI> for <HI>John,</HI> Son of <HI>Edmund Warren,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After <HI>Warren</HI> had quitted the Inheritance, I find the <HI>Fulshams</HI> by Purchase to be en∣tituled to the Fee-simple of it; and <HI>Benedict de Fulsham,</HI> enjoyed in at his Decease, which was in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and paid relief for this and <HI>Much Delce,</HI> under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of the above-said Prince. After this Family was worn out, it had successively the same Possessors with <HI>Much Delce,</HI> so that it came with that Mannor by Purchase from <HI>Tate,</HI> to Sir <HI>Richard Lea</HI> Knight; and from him is the Title by successive Descent, transported to <HI>Rtchard Lea</HI> Esquire, the present Possessor.</P>
<P><HI>Snodherst</HI> is another Mannor which lies partly spread into <HI>Chetham,</HI> and partly into the Limits of <HI>Rochester,</HI> was, as high as I can trace any Record, a Branch of that
<PB N="294" REF="155"/>Demeasn, which fell under the Dominion of <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> and though <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badēlesmer,</HI> had by his perfidious Disloyalty, forfeited it in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; yet was it in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, restored to his Son <HI>Bartholomew Badelesmer,</HI> who in the twelfth year of that Prince, dyed without Issue, and left it to his Brother <HI>Giles Badelesmer,</HI> who likewise deceasing without Issue; Sir <HI>John Tiptoft,</HI> in Right of <HI>Margery</HI> his Wife, one of his Sisters and Coheirs, entered upon the Inheritance of it: but, before the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, had alienated it to <HI>Benedict de Fulsham,</HI> for he in that year, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> paid respective relief for it, at the making the Black Prince Knight, After <HI>Fulshams</HI> were extinguished at this place, it had the Fate to own the Jurisdiction and Interest of those, who were the Successive Proprietaries of <HI>Much Delce,</HI> so that it is now knit to the present Inheritance of <HI>Richard Lea</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Little Delce</HI> is the last Mannor which is circumscribed within the Precincts of this City. It was, in Ages of a very high Calculation, the Possession of the no∣ble, illustrious, and ancient Family of <HI>Sherington,</HI> written in old Deeds, Pipe∣rolls, and other Evidences, <HI>Serington,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Scherington,</HI> but most fre∣quently <HI>Sherington:</HI> whose original and principal Seat, was at <HI>Sherington-hall</HI> at <HI>Cranworth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> though they had other Mannors, which bore their Name, which anciently were folded up in their Demeasne, as namely <HI>Sherington</HI> in the County of <HI>Buckingham, Sherington</HI> in <HI>Sussex, Sherington</HI> in the County of <HI>Here∣ford,</HI> and <HI>Sherington</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> yet, as I take it, in their Possession. But to proceed, <HI>Odo de Serington,</HI> or <HI>Sherington,</HI> for the Names are <HI>Synonyma</HI> or coinci∣dent, held this Mannor in the thirty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the first, and was enter∣red in the Cathedral of <HI>Rochester;</HI> and when <HI>Robert Glover Somerset Herald,</HI> col∣lected his <HI>Miscellany</HI> of Church-notes, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> there were some Reliques of his Monument, offered up to the Survey of a curious and Inquisitive Eye, which now the Sacrilegious Barbarity of impious Mechanicks, and the injurious Hand of Time together, have wholly dismantled. After <HI>She∣rington</HI> was worn out, I find a Family, called <HI>Pugeis,</HI> invested in the Inhe∣ritance, and there is mention in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in <HI>Kirkbies Inquest</HI> (a Book kept in the Exchequet,) of one <HI>Richard Pugeis</HI> who then held it: but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family had deserted the Pos∣session, and transmitted his Concernment in it by Sale to <HI>Richard Charles,</HI> and he enjoyed it at his Decease, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num</HI> 92. And so did <HI>Nicholas Charles</HI> his Successor, in the eleventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 16. And <HI>Robert</HI> was his Son and Heir, who dying without Issue, it was united to the Demeasne of <HI>Richard Ormes∣kirk,</HI> in right of <HI>Joan,</HI> Sister and Heir of the above-mentioned <HI>Robert;</HI> and he in the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, alienated it to <HI>Henry Perey,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northum∣berland;</HI> and he not long after, passed it away to <HI>Rickhull,</HI> in which Family it rested, untill the seventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was by Deed conveyed from <HI>William Rickhull</HI> Esquire, to <HI>Thomas Glover,</HI> and <HI>Henry Hunt,</HI> who had then the Custody or Guardianship of <HI>Rochester-Bridge,</HI> and to the successive Wardens of it, towards the Preservation and Reparation of its Fabrick for ever; so that at this instant, it is parcel of that Revenue, which rescues this noble Structure from Decay and Ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Nashenden</HI> next offers it self up to our Remembrance. In the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, I find it entituled to the Possession of a Family called <HI>Aspall,</HI> and in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John Aspall,</HI> paid respective Aid, at making the Black Prince Knight. But before the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond, this Family, had surrendred the Inheritance of this place to <HI>Peckham:</HI> the last of which Name, which held it, was <HI>John Peckham,</HI> who (as the Records of <HI>Rochester-Bridge</HI> informs me) in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, made it part of that Demeasn by Sale, which was to support, with its Income, the Fabrick of <HI>Ro∣chester</HI> Bridge, in whose Revenue, you may at this instant, still find it re∣sident.</P>
<PB N="295" REF="155"/>
<P><HI>Rolvenden</HI> gives Name to the Hundred wherein it is placed, and is resolved into several places of eminent Consideration, which do not only call for a Survey, but even exact it: The first is <HI>Halden,</HI> called in Records the Mannor of <HI>Lambin, alias Halden,</HI> and the Reason of this Denomination is, because it assumed the first part of this Name from <HI>Lambinus de Langham,</HI> who held it under the Distribution of a whole Knights Fee (as the Book called <HI>Testa de Nevill</HI> demonstrates) in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the Marriage of <HI>Isabell</HI> that Prince's Sister, at which Time he accounted so for it: After this Family was departed from the possession of this place, which was about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the <HI>Haldens</HI> were by purchase setled in the Possession, and <HI>William de Halden</HI> Son of <HI>John de Halden,</HI> died seised of it, in the fiftieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 45. and left it to his Son <HI>John Halden,</HI> but he expiring, about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in <HI>Joan</HI> his Daughter and Heir, she by matching with <HI>John Guldeford</HI> Esquire, made it parcel of his Patrimony, and from him it devolved by Descent to Sir <HI>Richard Guldeford,</HI> who was Knighted at <HI>Milford-haven</HI> by <HI>H.</HI> the seventh, and was afterwards one of the Privy Counsel to that Prince. In the eighth year of his reign, he with Courage and Prudence opposed <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> and his <HI>Cornish</HI> Squadrons, in that Erup∣tion which they made upon this County, and in the Battle waged near <HI>Deptford∣bridge,</HI> between King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and those Rebels, represented such signal Testimonies of personal Magnanimity, that he was by that Prince made a Banne∣ret at <HI>Black-heath.</HI> His Son <HI>Henry Guldeford</HI> Esquire, in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, went into <HI>Spain,</HI> and engaged himself under <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella,</HI> King and Queen of <HI>Castile</HI> and <HI>Aragon,</HI> in their Wars commenced against the <HI>Moores,</HI> and demeaned himself with that Fidelity and exemplary Resolution in all Conflicts entertained with those barbarous Infidels, that upon the Reduction of the Province of <HI>Granada,</HI> the above-mentioned Prince, for his signal Service performed in his and the Christian Quarrel, added to his Paternal Coat as an Augmentation, <HI>A Pomgranet slipped upon a Canton,</HI> being the Arms of that regained Province, and like∣wise dignified him with the Order of Knighthood. In the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, he was again invested with the abovesaid Order by that Prince, and in the fifth of his reign, he commanded one of the Royal Navy called the Regent, in which Ship he acted Things worth the future Remembrance in that Sea-fight, which was waged between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> near <HI>Brittain,</HI> and in the same year (as appears by the Original Patent bearing Date the twenty eighth of <HI>May</HI>) he was made Standard-bearer of <HI>England,</HI> and carried it at the Siege of <HI>Terwin:</HI> His Son Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Guldeford,</HI> in the fifteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, received the Order of Knight∣hood, for his Service at <HI>Tourney,</HI> and was Captain of the Horse under the Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> at the second Siege of <HI>Terwin,</HI> which was in the fifteenth year of that Prince, and not long after reduced <HI>Boghan-castle,</HI> taking the Advantage of the Win∣ter, which had sealed up the Marshes, which environed it, and made it almost in∣accessible in a Frost. In fine, this worthy Souldier and Patriot dying without Issue∣male, left this Mannor of <HI>Halden</HI> to be enjoyed by <HI>Jane</HI> his Sole Inheritrix, matched to <HI>John Dudley</HI> Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and he having unhappily engaged himself in that ruinous Design, which was to devest Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of the Royal Diadem, and place it on the Head of the Lady <HI>Jane Grey,</HI> wedded to his Son <HI>Guilford Dudley,</HI> was in the first year of that Queen, for that insolent Attempt, which proved un∣successful, attainted and beheaded, his Estate here being confiscated to the Crown, the Mannor was given by that Princess to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> her Attorney General, Ancestor to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Knight and Baronet, who at this Instant enjoyes the Mannor, but the Demeasne of it was granted to Sir <HI>Henry Sidney,</HI> whose Grand∣child <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> not many years since conveyed it to Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> whose Grand-child <HI>Robert Smith</HI> Esquire, lately died possest of it.</P>
<P>There are twelve <HI>Denns</HI> which hold of this Mannor of <HI>Lambin, aliàs Halden,</HI> and at the Court-day elect twelve Officers, called <HI>Beadles,</HI> to collect the Quit-rents, which relate to it: The Names of them here ensue, <HI>Midsell</HI> in <HI>Rolvenden, Stal∣lenden</HI> in <HI>Rolvenden, Ramsden</HI> in <HI>Benenden, West Bishoppenden</HI> in <HI>Benenden, Folkinden</HI> in <HI>Benenden</HI> and <HI>Sandherst, Holnherst</HI> in <HI>Benenden, Elderherst</HI> in <HI>Halden</HI> and <HI>Tenterden,
<PB N="296" REF="156"/>Ilehinden</HI> in <HI>Woodchurch, Mensden</HI> in <HI>Tenterden, Strenchden</HI> in <HI>Tenterden, Smeeth</HI> in <HI>Stone</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Oxney, Blackbrooks</HI> and <HI>Pisenden</HI> in <HI>Witresham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Casingham</HI> is a second place of Estimate. In Ages of a very high Ascent, I find it had Owners of the same Sirname; for, <HI>in Testa de Nevill,</HI> I find that <HI>William de Ca∣singham</HI> held the Mannor of <HI>Casingham,</HI> now corruptly called <HI>Keinsham,</HI> with <HI>Or∣lovingden,</HI> another inconsiderable Mannor annexed unto it, in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and paid respective <HI>Aid</HI> for it accordingly, under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at the Marriage of <HI>Isabell</HI> that Prince's Sister. In Times which were immediatly subsequent to the departure of this Family from this place, that is, in the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find by an Ancient Court-roll, the <HI>Moores</HI> to have been possest of it, and kept it in their Inheritance, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Gibbons</HI> of <HI>Rolven∣den;</HI> from which Family, about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as appears by the Court-rols, now in the Hands of my Learned Friend Mr. <HI>Kilbourn,</HI> it went away to <HI>Hay</HI> or <HI>Hays</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> and in this Name it remained until that Time which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was alienated to <HI>Everden</HI> or <HI>Everinden,</HI> descended from the <HI>Everindens</HI> of <HI>Everinden-house</HI> in <HI>Biddenden,</HI> where they are recorded by the private Deeds of that place, to have been resident many Hundred years, until in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> it was passed away by Sale to <HI>John Mils,</HI> Ancestor to the present Proprietary. But to proceed, the Continu∣ance of this Family at this place, was but brief and transitory; for not many years since, it went away by Sale from this Name to <HI>Muns,</HI> where the Inheritance still continues.</P>
<P><HI>Fresingham</HI> sometimes written <HI>Fersingham,</HI> and vulgarly called <HI>Frensham,</HI> is the last place of Account in <HI>Rolvenden.</HI> It had in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears by <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> a Family of that Name which was its Possessor; for <HI>John de Fresingham</HI> or <HI>Fersingham</HI> held it then, and paid for it after the Rate of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at the Marriage of <HI>Isabell</HI> that Prince's Sister. And in this Family did it remain until the latter part of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then the Vicissitude of Purchase brought it to be the Demeasne of <HI>Norwood,</HI> and in this Name was it resident, until the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then, as appears by the old Rols of this Mannor, it was conveyed to <HI>Guldeford,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Guldeford,</HI> up∣on his Decease, gave it to his second Son Sir <HI>George Guldeford,</HI> from whom it de∣scended to his Grand-child Sir <HI>Edward Guldford,</HI> who about the beginning of King <HI>James</HI> passed it away to Mr. <HI>Fowle,</HI> who bequeathed it to his second Son Mr. ...... <HI>Fowle,</HI> who sold it to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Knight and Baronet, Grand-father to Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> who possesses the instant Signory and Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hole</HI> in this Parish was a Seat which had Owners of that Sirname, for in the year 1340. <HI>Henry at Hole</HI> demises this place-by Deed to his two Sisters <HI>Honor</HI> and <HI>Alice;</HI> but for many Descents last past,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Edmund Gibbons</HI> was of this Family, who foun∣ded the Free-School at <HI>Benen∣den,</HI> and setled 30. l. <HI>per An∣num</HI> for its endow∣ment.</NOTE> it hath been the Patrimony of <HI>Gibbons,</HI> who held Land in this Parish in the year 1326. and was the Seminary or Original Seed-plot, whence all of that Name and Family in <HI>Kent</HI> primitively sprouted forth, and though Sir <HI>William Segar</HI> did assigne to Mr. <HI>Gibbons</HI> of <HI>Westcliff, A Lion Rampant between three Escollops,</HI> and to this Family, <HI>A Lion Rampant between three Ogrises,</HI> as their Coat-Armor, yet in ancient coloured Glasse at <HI>Hole</HI> now the Inheritance of Colonel <HI>Robert Gibbons,</HI> the paternal Coat of this Family is represented to have been, <HI>Or, A Lion Rampant Sables charged with an Escarbuncle Pomettee and Flourette of the first,</HI> which I mention that this Family now of <HI>Hole</HI> might receive no prejudice by his Mistake or inadvertency.</P>
<P><HI>Fersham</HI> in this Parish, was (as appears by some dateless Deeds) the Patrimony of Sir <HI>John de Fersham. Stephen de Fersham,</HI> this mans Successor, in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, found a man at Arms for Guard of the Sea Coasts, which im∣plies he was of eminence in those Times: In Times of a latter Date; that is, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find it possest by <HI>Guldeford,</HI> and remained with the Revenue of that Family until the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was passed away to <HI>Dike</HI> of <HI>Sussex,</HI> whose Descendants by their Trustees and Commissio∣ners, not many years since conveyed their joynt-Interest in it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Brom∣feild</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Merchant.</P>
<PB N="297" REF="156"/>
<P><HI>Old Romney</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Langport,</HI> is eminent for two or three places which lie within the Confines of it, which are both of Spiritual and Secular Concern∣ment. The first is <HI>Agne-court</HI> and <HI>Orgarswike,</HI> not distant by any considerable Difference of space from this Town, and which was once a Parish entirely in it self, until, it is probable, the unhealthful Situation made the Inhabitants vary their Station and dislodge: which were both given by <HI>Offa</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> in the year seven hundred eighty and one, to the Prior and Monks of <HI>Christ-church, ad Pascua Porcorum,</HI> say the Records of that Covent, that is, for the feeding or grazing of their Hoggs. And it is possible that the Foundation of this Grant was the profuse Effusion, not only of Christian, but of Innocent Blood, which had been so pro∣digally wasted, to be subservient and ministerial to the ambitious Interests and Passi∣ons of the above-mentioned Prince, and though peradventure he had endeavored to wash off those Crimson Stains which stuck upon his Hands, besmeared with the Blood of <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of the <HI>East-Angles,</HI> and others, with penitential Pears; yet he deemed that an insufficient Expiation to assoil himself from his contracted Guilt, unlesse he made his Compunction more visible and conspicuous, by a Mu∣nificent Manifestation both of his Piety and Charity together.</P>
<P><HI>Bere</HI> or <HI>Berry-court</HI> in <HI>Old Romney</HI> (for it carried the first Appellation in very Old Evidences) is a Mannot which hath contracted a Reputation from those large Quit∣rents and other Services which appertain unto it, rather then from the Dimension and extent of its Revenue, which is but narrow and circumscribed; <HI>Nicholas de Bere</HI> held it, in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears by an old Court-roll, which hath an Aspect upon that Time. He was Son of <HI>Richard de Bere,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Recognitores Magnae Assisae</HI> (an Office of a wide circumference of Trust in that Age) in the second year of King <HI>John,</HI> in the great Controversie which was started between <HI>Richard de Garwinton,</HI> and <HI>Theobald de Twitham,</HI> concerning Land at <HI>Ilding</HI> in <HI>Kingston.</HI> In the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find that <HI>Robert Forneaux, Robert Atwood,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Tutwise</HI> had some Interest in <HI>Berry-court,</HI> and paid respective <HI>Aide</HI> for it, as the Book of <HI>Aide</HI> informs me, at making the Black Prince Knight: But before the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find the Title wholly concentered in <HI>Belknap;</HI> for Sir <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> the Judge, did not only hold it in the first year, but likewise in the tenth of that Prince: at what Time being attainted and banished, by the Malevolent Concurrence of some ambitious Lords, whose Influence like a Confederacy of Malignant Aspects in the Stars, combined to Ruine him, this by Escheat was invested in the Crown, and was by Royal Con∣cession (as appears by the Original Patent) conveyed in the thirteenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the third; to <HI>John Brockman.</HI> In Times of a lower step, that is, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, I find it in the Possession of <HI>John Newland:</HI> but whether by Purchase from <HI>Brockman</HI> or not, for want of Intelligence, I cannot discover. And in this Family the Propriety continued, until the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to Sir <HI>George Perkins,</HI> from whom almost in our Memory the same Mutation brought it to confess the instant possession of Mr. ...... <HI>Aldridge</HI> of <HI>Tilers</HI> near <HI>Reding.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rucking</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hamme,</HI> in Ancient Records written <HI>Roking,</HI> was, by the Piety and Charitable Munificence of King <HI>Offa,</HI> in the year seven hundred eighty and one, given to the Prior and Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> and was in the Original Donation granted <HI>ad Pascua Porcorum,</HI> for the Pasture of their Hoggs, and it con∣tinued clasped up in their Revenue, until the Tempest of the general Dissolution arose and overtook it; for, there being a Surrender of the Revenue of this Covent, into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty third year of his reign, he united it to the Dean and Chapiter of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> which he shortly after established and moulded out of their Ruines, and here it continued until a late Storm arose again, and tore it off.</P>
<P><HI>Barbedinden</HI> is another eminent Mannor within the Boundaries of this Parish, which had in Ages of a more Ancient Inscription Proprietaries of the same Deno∣mination; <HI>William de Barbodinden</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the ninth of
<PB N="298" REF="157"/><HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 3. And left it to his Son and Heir <HI>John de Bar∣bodinden,</HI> who in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> paid an Auxiliary supply for it at making the Black Prince Knight. After this Family was extinguished, <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> the Judge succeeded in the Possession of it: and I do not find, that, though the Crown upon his Attaint, seised upon much of his Estate, that ever his Interest here was ravished away from him; for he was in Posses∣sion of this place at his Death, which was in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and disposed it by Will, to his Son <HI>John Belknap,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, alienates it to <HI>Engham:</HI> amongst whose Demeasne, the Propriety of this Mannor had not many years dwelt, but the Title was by Sale supplanted, and cast into the Possession of Sir <HI>Matthew Brown</HI> Knight, and his Son <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> Esquire, in the last year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; passed it away by Sale to <HI>Anthony Lovelace</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to <HI>Richard Lovelace,</HI> who some few years since, alienated his entire Concern∣ment in it, to the late Possessor Mr. <HI>Richard Hulse,</HI> descended from the ancient Family of <HI>Hulse,</HI> of the <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Hulse,</HI> lying within <HI>Namptwich,</HI> in the County of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>

<P><HI>SAltwood</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hene,</HI> hath an open Prospect into the Ocean, which flowed up much nearer, then now it doth, and imparted its Nature to its Name: for in Latin it is written <HI>de Bosco Salso.</HI> The Arch-bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> had here formerly a magnificent Castle, which Time hath much dismantled; and a Park well stored with Deere, now vanished and gon. Many Mannors in this Track, are held of it by Knights Service, which justly made it to be counted and called an Honour. It was granted to the Church, in the year 1096, by one <HI>Halden,</HI> who for Grandeur and opulency, was reckoned one of the Princes of <HI>England.</HI> The Value and extent of it, are more particularly set forth, in the Records of the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the Conquerour's Time, and they speak thus: <HI>In Limwarlaed in Hundred. de Hede, habet Hugo de Montfort de Terra Mouachorum</HI> I <HI>Manerium Saltwode de Archi∣episcopo, &amp; Comes Godwinus tenuit illud, &amp; tunc se defendebat pro</HI> VII <HI>Sullings</HI> (That was <HI>Godwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> who by a possessory right, held many Towns along this Coast) <HI>&amp; nunc sunt</HI> V. <HI>&amp; tamen non Scottent, nisi pro</HI> III. <HI>Et in Burgo de Hede sunt</HI> CC. <HI>&amp;</HI> XXV. <HI>Burgenses, qui pertinent huic Manerio, de quibus non habet Hugo nisi</HI> III. <HI>Forisfacta</HI> (for it lies in the Franchise of the five Ports, and the King was to have their Serice <HI>&amp; est appretiatum</HI> XXVIII. <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> <HI>&amp;</HI> IIII. This was <HI>Hugh Mont∣fort,</HI> who was one of those powerfull Men, which entered <HI>England</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour.</P>
<P>In the Time of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the second, <HI>Henry de Essex,</HI> Baron of <HI>Ralegh</HI> in that Coun∣ty, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports <HI>(pro Tempore)</HI> and the King's Standard-bearer in right of Inheritance held this Castle of the Arch-bishop, who having in a leight Skirmish against the <HI>Welsh</HI> in <HI>Flintshire,</HI> not only cast away his Courage, but his Standard also; was appealed of high Treason, and in a legal Duell or Combate, vanquished by his Challenger, and being possest with regret and shame, contracted from this Defeat, shrouded himself in a Cloister, and put on a Monks Cowle for∣feiting a goodly Patrimony and Lively-hood, which escheated to King <HI>Henry</HI> the second. But <HI>Thomas Beckett</HI> acquainting the King, that this Mannor belonged to his Church and Sea; that Prince being beyond the Seas, directed a Writt to K. <HI>Henry</HI> his Son (the Draught of which is represented to us by <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> whither I referre the Reader) for Restitution: But in regard of new emergent Contests, between King <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and that insolent Prelate, it was not re∣stored unto the Church untill the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> the second.</P>
<P>The Castle was magnificently inlarged and repaired by <HI>William Courtney,</HI> Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, as his Will doth de∣clare,
<PB N="299" REF="157"/>and his Arms in Stone-work eminently demonstrate, and remained, after his Decease, annexed to the Archiepiscopal Revenue, untill <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> in the twen∣ty ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, exchanged it with that Prince. And his Son King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, in the fourth year of his Raign, granted it to <HI>Edward</HI> Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Clinton,</HI> who not long after conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Henry Herdson,</HI> whose Grand∣child Mr. <HI>Francis Herdson,</HI> passed it away, about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to <HI>Robert Cranmer</HI> Esquire, by whose Daughter and Heir, <HI>Ann Cranmer,</HI> it devol∣ved to Sir <HI>Arthur Harris</HI> of <HI>Crixey</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Cranmer Harris,</HI> not ma∣ny years since, alienated it to Sir <HI>William Boteler,</HI> Father to Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler</HI> Baronet, the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>There is an old vast Mansion House of Stone, at <HI>Brochull</HI> in this Parish, on the side of a Steep Hill, which was the Seat and ancient Residence of a Family as eminent for Antiquity, as any in this Track, and extracted their Sirname from hence, and were called <HI>Brochull,</HI> who flourished here in Knights Degree, and in some Parliaments in the Time of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, and <HI>Edw.</HI> the fourth, sate there as Knights of the Shire. <HI>Margaret</HI> the Wife of <HI>William,</HI> builded, or caused to be built, an Isle on the Northside the Parish Church. You may rove at the Time by the rudenesse of the Words, which are here transcribed out of the East Window, where they stand engrossed, in an antiquated Character: <HI>Margareta La Famma Gillam de Brockhilla fio Fera sata Shapella.</HI></P>
<P>From hence branched forth the <HI>Brockhills,</HI> or <HI>Brockhulls</HI> (for anciently they were written so, both ways) both of <HI>Cale-hill,</HI> and <HI>Aldington Septuans</HI> in <HI>Thurnham:</HI> But the Male Line fayling here in <HI>Thomas Brockhull, Elizabeth</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, brought it to be possest by <HI>Richard Selling,</HI> in which Family, after the Interest of it, stay∣ed untill allmost our Fathers Remembrance, it was by the same Devolution, carried off to acknowledge the Propriety of <HI>Tournay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sandhurst</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Selbrittenden,</HI> was, with much other Land granted by King <HI>Offa,</HI> in the year 791, to <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury.</HI> But <HI>Betherinden</HI> was always of temporal Interest; for it afforded both Seat and Sirname, to a Fa∣mily of this Denomination, and <HI>John de Bethrinden,</HI> dyed seised of it, in the year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: But not long, after, did it reside in this Family; for this Name expired in a Female Inheritrix, who was matched to <HI>Finch,</HI> who united this Seat to his Demeasne; and here it lay untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> and then it was rent off by Sale, and placed in <HI>Pelham;</HI> and from this Name a Mutation of the same Circumstance, took it away; and, in our Fathers Remembrance annexed it to the Inheritance of <HI>Fowl,</HI> and remains still with the Des∣cendants of that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Aldrinden</HI> is a third place of Account in <HI>Sandhurst,</HI> had Owners of that Sirname: of whom <HI>Roger de Aldrinden,</HI> as the private Deeds of this place do inform me, was the last in the Male descent, who left it to his Daughter and Heir <HI>Christian Aldrin∣den;</HI> and she in the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, passed it away to <HI>John Sellbrittenden;</HI> who not long after, alienated it to <HI>Thomas Bourne,</HI> and he held it as appears by an old Court-roll, in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; and from him did it by the Chain of Descent, passe along, untill it arrived at <HI>John Bourn,</HI> who dying in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, settled it by Will, on <HI>Joan</HI> his Female Inheritrix, matched to <HI>Thomas Allard,</HI> and by this Alliance, did it descend to his Son <HI>Henry Allard,</HI> who had Issue <HI>John Allard;</HI> who alienated his Right in it by Sale, to <HI>John Twisden</HI> Gentleman, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; from whom it came down to his Successor Mr. <HI>William Twisden;</HI> who about the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> sold it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Downton</HI> Esquire, Father of Mr. <HI>Richard Downton</HI> of <HI>Istleworth</HI> Esquire, Justice of the Peace for the County of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> now Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Combden</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which was anciently possest by <HI>Fulk de Ballard;</HI> that <HI>Fulk,</HI> who, as appears by the Book called <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> in the Ex∣chequer, paid a respective supply for Land in <HI>Sandhurst,</HI> at the marriage of <HI>Isabell</HI> Sister to King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the twentieth year of that Prince: but not long did the Propriety of this place, rest in this Family; for in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the
<PB N="300" REF="158"/>second, I find it in the Possession of the <HI>Whitfields,</HI> an ancient Family, descended from <HI>Whitfield</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> of which Stock was Sir <HI>Ithan de Whitfield,</HI> who in behalf of the Barons, then knit together in an hostile confederacy against their Prince, (as an old <HI>French</HI> Manuscript informs me) <HI>tue Borough-bridge</HI> 15. <HI>Edwardi secundi, il est oit contre le Roy,</HI> defended <HI>Borough-bridge</HI> against <HI>Edward</HI> the second. And ever since the Government of that Prince above-mentioned, was this place constantly fastned by the Thread of many Descents to the Patrimony, though not of this Fa∣mily, yet of this Name, until Sir <HI>Ralph Whitfield</HI> deceasing not many years since, bequeathed it by Will to his Daughter Mrs. <HI>Dorothy Whitfield,</HI> who hath now brought it by Marriage to be the possession of <HI>John Fotherly</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P>Here is a place in this Parish, which, however it be now under a cloudy and ob∣scure Character, was in Ages of a higher Gradation, the Inheritance of the Noble Family of <HI>Twisden:</HI> and certainly here they lived, when they writ, <HI>de Denna Fracta,</HI> and from them it hath borrowed the Title of <HI>Twisden-street</HI> or <HI>Borough,</HI> which it re∣tains to this Day. Indeed <HI>Twisden</HI> in the Original <HI>Saxon,</HI> imports no more but the broken Valley, or the Vale distinguished into two peeces,</P>
<P><HI>Shadockherst</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Blackborn, Chart, Longbridge</HI> and <HI>Ham,</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Forstall,</HI> and sometimes written <HI>at Forstall,</HI> which were of no contemptible Extraction in this County; for in several Ancient Deeds, I find <HI>John at Forstall,</HI> and <HI>Richard at Forstall</HI> to be Witnesses, and it is probable they were Possessors of this Mannor, though the private Deeds reach out to our View, no higher discovery then the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth; for in the third year of that Prince's reign, <HI>Joan Forstall</HI> passes it away by Deed to <HI>Stokys,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Stokes,</HI> and in that Family was the Interest of it many years clasped up, until at last the or∣dinary Vicissitude of Purchase brought it to be the Demeasne of <HI>Randolph,</HI> who had an Estate likewise about <HI>Burham</HI> near <HI>Maidstone.</HI> And from this Name, about the beginning of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, it went away by Sale to Sir <HI>John Taylor,</HI> who in the twenty fifth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away to <HI>John Taylor</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> Esquire, who is now invested in the Possession of it, and from whom I confesse I have received my Intelligence concerning those who were the former Proprietaries of it.</P>
<P><HI>Criols-court</HI> in this Parish was one of those Seats which related to the Patrimony of <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> and he died seised of it, in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and left it to his Son <HI>John de Crioll,</HI> who deceasing about the beginning of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third without Issue, it devolved to <HI>Joan</HI> his Sister and Heir, who was matched to Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley:</HI> but he likewise determined in <HI>Agnes Rokesley,</HI> who was one of his two Female Co-heirs, and she by matching with <HI>Thomas de Poynings</HI> entituled that Family to the possession of that wide Estate, which devol∣ved to her in Right of her Mother, and from him did it descend to his Successor Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> Son of <HI>Robert Poynings,</HI> a man very eminent in the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh. For this Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> in the first year of his Rule, immedi∣atly after he had triumphed over <HI>Richard</HI> the third in <HI>Bosworth-field,</HI> was chosen one of his Privy Councel to manage the publick Interest of the Nation: Afterwards he most vigorusly opposed <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> and his <HI>Cornish</HI> Squadrons being then in Defection to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, in the tenth year of his reign. And this Sir <HI>Edward</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, though his Office was not found until the fourteenth of that Prince, and then it being discove∣red that the whole Stock and Lineage of this Family were extinguished, and that there were none who were legally begotten (for Sir <HI>Thomas Poynings</HI> was his natural Son) that either in a direct or collateral Line, could pretend a Title to his Estate, it escheated to the Crown. And <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth afterwards passed it away by Grant to <HI>William Taylor,</HI> whose Sutcessor Mr. <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> passed it away to <HI>George Taylor,</HI> and he had Issue Mr. <HI>John Taylor,</HI> who concluding in <HI>Anne</HI> his Sole Daugh∣ter and Heir, she by a Match with <HI>Whitfeild,</HI> annexed it to the Demeasne of that Name, from whom again, not many years since, it came over by Sale to <HI>More,</HI> who very lately hath alienated it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Mincing-court,</HI> vnlgarly so called, but Originally, and in Old Records styled
<PB N="301" REF="158"/><HI>Minikens-court,</HI> is likewife circumscribed within the Verge of <HI>Shadock herst.</HI> It was parcel of that Income which did support in elder Times the Hospital of St. <HI>Jacobs</HI> in <HI>Tanington</HI> by <HI>Canterbury,</HI> which was founded to be a Receptacle of Leprous Women, and confirmed by <HI>Hubert</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> about the begin∣ning of King <HI>John:</HI> and to this Covent did it relate, until the reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then though it had not been torn off from the Revenue of the above∣said Hospital, by the violent Hand of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; yet it was alienated by that Prince, and in the second year of his Rule it was granted to <HI>Robert Tatteshall</HI> Esquire, to hold of his Mannor of <HI>East-Greenwich, tantum per Fidelitatem Servitii,</HI> and from him immediatly after it came over by purchase to Sir <HI>Edward Wotton.</HI> And when Cardinal <HI>Poole</HI> visited <HI>Kent,</HI> in the year 1557. he was found invested in it, and from him did it by paternal Delegation devolve to his Successor <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> who setled it upon his eldest Daughter <HI>Katherine,</HI> upon her Marriage with <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> Son and Heir to <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> and this Lady not long since hath alienated her Interest in it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Harfleet</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stalesfeild</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was a Limb of that vast Revenue which fell under the Jurisdiction and Signory of the Knights Templers, and is registred under that Notion, in that Book kept in the Exchequer, styled <HI>Liber de Terris Tem∣plariorum.</HI> And in Mr. <HI>Robert Glovers</HI> Church-Notes of <HI>Kent,</HI> there is in this Church represented the Pourtracture of a Chevalier maled in Armour, whose Face is only visible, and that pourtracted with a long Beard, which induces me to believe, that it was the Effigies of some eminent Person of this Order; for in all the Sculpture and Imagery of the Knights Templers, both Ancient and Modern, they are still delivered to Posterity under that Representation. And <HI>Peter Auger</HI> falling under the Censure of a Knight Templer, in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, though <HI>Valett</HI> to that Prince, because he nourished a long and diffused Beard, was absolved and discharged by his Master, by satisfying the publick, that though he wore a long Beard, he was no Knight Templer. But to advance in my Survey; Af∣ter that fatal Tempest, which was conjured up by the Magick of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> and its Emissaries, had, in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, shook this Order into a total Dissolution, this Mannor which lay clasped up in their Revenue, was united by Royal Concession to the Demeasne of the Knights of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and there it dwelt, untill the general suppression, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, dislodged it, and threw it into the possession of the Crown, where it lay involved, until King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, in the fourth year of his Government, by Grant planted the Propriety in Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> and he immediatly after pas∣sed it away to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> who was afterwards slain bravely disputing the Interest of the <HI>English</HI> Nation at <HI>Calais,</HI> against the Assaults of the <HI>French:</HI> and his Successor, about the beginning of King <HI>James</HI> alienated it to <HI>Salter,</HI> from whom it is now come down to Sir <HI>Nicholas Salter,</HI> who is entituled to the instant Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Darbies-court</HI> in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family, which was known to the World by no other Denomination, and certainly was a Family of generous Account in this Track; for in very ancient Registers and Rols of <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentry; I find this Coat to be borne by this Name, <HI>videlicet, Partie per Cheveron embattelled, Or, and Azure, three Eagles counterchanged:</HI> And of this Family was <HI>John Darby</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1445. and built the South-Isle of St. <HI>Dionis Back-church</HI> near <HI>Lime-street,</HI> where the Windows represent to our View the above-mentioned Coat, as the best Index to the Memory of so munificent a Benefactor: But to proceed; Before the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the Pro∣priety of this Mansion was by Sale conveyed from <HI>Darby</HI> to <HI>St. Leger,</HI> where its aboad was of as brief a continuance; for the Male-line failing in <HI>Thomas St. Leger</HI> Esquire, who bought it, by <HI>Joan</HI> his Daughter and Co-heir wedded to <HI>Henry Au∣cher</HI> Esquire, it came over to be the Inheritance of that Family, and in their Re∣venue was constantly fixed, until the Age and Remembrance of our Grand-fathers, and then it was alienated to Sir <HI>Michael Sonds</HI> of <HI>Eastry,</HI> from whom by hereditary Right it devolved to Sir <HI>Richard Sonds</HI> of <HI>Throuley,</HI> who in his Life-time passed it
<PB N="302" REF="159"/>away to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>George Sonds,</HI> now of <HI>Leeze</HI>-Court in <HI>Shelvich,</HI> Knight of the Bath, to whom the Possession of this Mannor at this instant is en∣tituled</P>
<P><HI>Stamford</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Folkstone,</HI> is in it self, a small obscure Village, but made eminent by containing within the Limits of it, <HI>Ostenhanger,</HI> a Seat of as much Account and Eminence, as any in the County. The Demeasne which rela∣ted to it, was divided between the two noble Families of <HI>Crioll</HI> and <HI>Auberville: Bertram de Crioll,</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and is written in the Pipe-roll of that year, of <HI>Westenhanger,</HI> a Name co∣incident with the other. Sir <HI>William de Auberville</HI> lived at the Borough of <HI>Westen∣hanger,</HI> when he founded the Abby of <HI>West-Langdon,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> the first: he had <HI>Hugh de Auberville,</HI> who likewise (as appears by the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of that Covent, being, a liberal Benefactor to that Cloister) was his Son and Heir, and he had Issue Sir <HI>William de Auberville,</HI> in whom the Male-Line determined, and he had only a Female Inheritrix, espoused to <HI>Nicholas de Crioll,</HI> whether of a. Younger House, or else a Younger Son to <HI>Bertram de Crioll</HI> above-mentioned, I cannot discover: <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> had Issue <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> who dyed possest of a great Proportion of <HI>Ostenhanger,</HI> in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, as appears <HI>Rot.

And left it to <HI>Joan</HI> his Daughter, married to Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> who upon the Decease of her only Brother <HI>John de Crioll,</HI> without Issue, became his Sole Heir. This Sir <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> was one of those eminent <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, that accompanied King <HI>Edward</HI> the first into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for his signal Service performed at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> was made a Banneret by that Prince:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Rot.

Upon the Devision of the Estate, <HI>Westenhanger</HI> was annexed to the Demeasne of <HI>Michaell de Poynings,</HI> and he had Issue <HI>Thomas de Poynings,</HI> who was summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, his Son and Heir was <HI>Robert Poynings,</HI> who in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, with <HI>Iohn Perry,</HI> were designed by Authority, to take the Sub∣scriptions of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who were summoned in, to renounce the Title of the House of <HI>York,</HI> which it seems was then in secret Agitation, to be set up against she House of <HI>Lanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster;</HI> and this <HI>Robert,</HI> was oftentimes summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of that Prince. The last time I find him sum∣moned, was in the twenty third year of his Government, and his Son and Heir was <HI>Robert Poynings,</HI> who was likewise summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of the above-mentioned Monarch, and deceased the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and left his Estate here to that worthy Person his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> of whom more hereafter. I shall now discover, how that Division of <HI>Ostenhanger,</HI> which devolved to <HI>Nicholas de Crioll,</HI> by the Heir of <HI>Auberville,</HI> was passed away: <HI>Nicholas de Crioll,</HI> had Issue <HI>John de Crioll,</HI> who in the nineteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, obtained a Licence, to found a Chantry in the Chappel of St. <HI>Johns</HI> in <HI>Ostenhanger,</HI> and endow it with one Messuage, forty five Acres of Glebe, and six Acres of Pasture situated in <HI>Limn,</HI> as appears <HI>Prima Parte Pat. de Anno</HI> 19. <HI>Edwardi tertii Memb.</HI> 4.

<PB N="303" REF="159"/>the Quarrel of the House of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and dying without Issue-male, <HI>Thomas Fogge</HI> Esquire, in his Wife's Right, who was one of his Daughters and Co-heirs, ente∣red upon his Estate here at <HI>Ostenhanger,</HI> and about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, passed it away to his eldest Brother Sir <HI>John Fogge</HI> of <HI>Repton,</HI> who died possest of it, in the seventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and bequeathed it by Testament to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>John Fogge,</HI> who about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, de∣mised his Concernment here to Sir <HI>Edward Poynings;</HI> which <HI>Edward Poynings</HI> was one of the Privy Councel to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and lived here, when he so vigo∣rously in the tenth year of that Prince, opposed the proceedings of <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> who was afterwards defeated at <HI>Black-heath,</HI> and likewise was Lord De∣puty of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Knight of the Garter, and by his Influence on that Nation, was that eminent Statute enacted, which ever since hath been adopted into his Fa∣mily, and called <HI>Poynings-Law.</HI> He was likewise at the Siege of <HI>Terwin,</HI> with <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the eighth, and was there for his eminent Service created Knight Banneret, and Governour of that Town. He died in the twelfth year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and was found after a serious Inquisition taken after his Death, in the fourteenth year of that Prince, to have neither any Issue lawfully begotten, nor any collate∣ral Alliance, that could by any remote Affinity eptitle themselves to his Estate, and so by Escheat it became invested in the Crown: but King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, out of his indulgent Bounty, by Royal Concession made it the Inheritance of his natural Son <HI>Thomas Poynings,</HI> who was a Person of excellent and elegant Composure, and eminent Merit, and was made Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> at the Coronation of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in the twenty fourth of that Prince's reign, and afterwards having represen∣ted to the World signal Demonstrations in a publick Joust or Tournament, of a re∣markable Strength and Courage, was in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, called to sit in Parliament, as Baron <HI>Poynings</HI> of <HI>Ostenhanger:</HI> but in the thirty se∣venth of that Prince's reign, deceased without Issue, upon whose <HI>Exit</HI> this Man∣not reverts to the Crown, and there lay couched, until the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then it was granted to <HI>John Dudley</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> afterwards Duke of <HI>Northumberland:</HI> upon whose Attainder, in the first year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> it be∣came again parcel of the Royal Patrimony; and afterwards Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> about the beginning of her reign, passed it away by Grant to her Kinsman Sir <HI>Thomas Sack∣ville,</HI> and he not long after, alienated it by Sale to <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> Esquire, vulgar∣ly called <HI>Customer Smith,</HI> who much enhaunsed the Beauty of the Fabrick, which had been empaired and defaced with Fire, with magnificent Additions: from whom it is now transmitted by paternal Descent to his great Grand-child, the Right Hono∣rable <HI>Philip Smith</HI> Viscount <HI>Strangford,</HI> who hath made it his principal Residence.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Heyton,</HI> lies likewise in <HI>Stamford,</HI> which was anciently possest by a Family of deep Antiquity, which was known to the World by that Sirname, and bore for their Cognisance in Ancient Armorials, <HI>Gules three Piles Argent.

<P><HI>Stansted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wrotham,</HI> represents to our Remembrance an Ancient Family called <HI>Grapinell,</HI> who were once Owners of this place, and flourished here under the Scepter of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first: but going out in Daugh∣ters and Co-heirs, <HI>Margeria</HI> one of them, by marching with <HI>William de Inge,</HI> who was a Judge, in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, knit this Mannor to the Inheri∣tance of this Family, and he died seised of it, in the fifteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

After the <HI>Zouches</HI> the <HI>Colepepers</HI> were by purchase from them entituled to the Possession, and <HI>Richard Colepeper</HI> was found to hold it at his Death, which was in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, and from this Family, about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, it passed away to <HI>Thomas Leigh,</HI> whose Son <HI>John Leigh</HI> gave it to his natural Son <HI>Richard Leigh,</HI> in the year 1575. and he not long after alienated it to <HI>Bing</HI> of <HI>Wrotham,</HI> from which Family it is very lately carried away to <HI>William James</HI> of <HI>Ightam</HI> Esquire, one of the Justices of the Peace of this County, a Person who for his Affection to Learning and Anti∣quity, cannot be mentioned without an Attribute.</P>
<P><HI>Soranks</HI> in this Parish, was the Seat of a Family, which borrowed its Sirname from hence, and had the Repute of a Mannor, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. For <HI>Roger de Sorancks</HI> held this Mannor (as is evident by the Book of <HI>Aide</HI> kept in the Exchecquer) in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, by Knights Service of the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> But after the reign of that Prince, it was not very constant to the Interest of this Name; for about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond, I find it in the possession of <HI>Thomas Mortimer,</HI> Lord of the Mannor of <HI>Mor∣timers</HI> in <HI>Cowling,</HI> and he in the twentieth year of the abovesaid Monarch, passed it away to <HI>William Skrene,</HI> and when this Name was worn out at this place, the Fa∣mily of <HI>Wood</HI> was ingrafted in the possession, and rested there until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was by <HI>Thomas Wood</HI> passed away to <HI>Robert Bare∣foot,</HI> in which Family the Title was as transient; for <HI>Thomas Barefoot</HI> this mans Son, in the third and fourth of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> alienated it to <HI>Henry Fanshaw,</HI> who almost in our Fathers Remembrance conveyed the Fee-simple unto <HI>Launce.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Stapleherst</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Twyford,</HI> was as appears by Ancient Deeds and In∣quisitions, as to some part of it, folded up in the large Patrimony of <HI>Fremingham,</HI> whose capital Residence was at <HI>Fremingham</HI> or <HI>Farningham,</HI> where I have treated more largely of them: but when the Male-line of this Family determined in <HI>John de Fremingham, Joan</HI> his only Sister matched to <HI>John Isley</HI> Esquire, Son of <HI>Isley</HI> was found to be his Heir, in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and in her Right <HI>Ro∣ger Isley</HI> Son and Heir of this <HI>John,</HI> entered upon it, and from him the Land here, by a successive Thread of Descent, was wafted down to the Noble, but infortunate Sir <HI>Henry Isley,</HI> of whom more presently: but another parcel of this Mannor did acknowledge the Signory of <HI>Pimpe</HI> of <HI>Nettlested,</HI> and <HI>William Pimpe</HI> died possest of it, in the year of our Lord 1375. as part of his Knights Fee called <HI>Pimps:</HI> and in his Line did the Title flow constantly along, until it devolved to <HI>Reginald Pimpe</HI> Esquire, who about the twelfth year of. <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, demised it by private Deed to <HI>John Isley</HI> Esquire, from whom it came down to his Grand-child Sir <HI>Henry Isley,</HI> who being entangled too fatally in the ruinous Design of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> was in
<PB N="305" REF="160"/>the second year of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> attainted, and his Interest in this Mannor connsca∣ted to the Crown, which was granted out of it again that present year to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> Ancestor to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, who is still entituled to the Propriety <HI>Isley</HI> had formerly in this place.</P>
<P><HI>Boxley</HI> Abby was formerly concerned in some Demeasne likewise here at <HI>Stapleherst,</HI> as appears by an Inquisition taken in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<P><HI>Newsted</HI> is a Mannor in this Parish, which was annexed to the free Chappel erect∣ed at this place by <HI>Hamon de Crevequer,</HI> and invested with ample Privileges, which Donation of his, and all the Franchises united to it, was confirmed (as appears by the first Book of Compositions kept in the Registers Office at <HI>Rochester</HI>) in the forty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: But when the Statute in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, had overturned all Chauntries, this Mannor was swallowed up in the Revenue of the Crown, and then the abovesaid Prince, by his Royal Concession planted it in the Patrimony of Sir <HI>Edward Wotton,</HI> Ancestor to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton</HI> of <HI>Boughton Malherbe,</HI> who setled it in Marriage on <HI>Katharine-Wotton</HI> his eldest Daughter and Co-heir espoused to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> and she by her Feoffees in Trust hath demi∣sed the Fee-simple to Mr. <HI>Robert Oliver</HI> of <HI>Leybourn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Loveherst</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, was parcel of that Estate, which by its Income supported the Priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> and upon the Suppression, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted to Sir <HI>John Gage,</HI> in the thirty fourth year of his reign, and he in the thirty sixth of that Prince, demised it to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> Esquire, who not long after alienated it to <HI>Thomas Wilford</HI> Esquire, from whom about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it passed away by Sale to Mr. <HI>John Baker,</HI> in whose Descendants the Title is yet resident.</P>
<P><HI>Engeherst</HI> presents it self next to our View, it is now vulgarly called <HI>Henherst,</HI> in Ages of an higher Ascent <HI>Engeherst,</HI> for some old Deeds without Date bounding some Land in this Parish of <HI>Stapleherst,</HI> make it situated <HI>juxta Terras Osberti de Heng∣herst supra Dennam de Engherst,</HI> and from this Den or Vally, did that Ancient Fa∣mily, called <HI>Engherst</HI> or <HI>Hengherst,</HI> take the first Extraction of its Name, who bore, as appears by several Seals, for their paternal Armory, <HI>Barrie of six peeces,</HI> and having continued in the possession of this place for many Descents, at last the In∣heritance was transmitted to <HI>Henry Hengherst,</HI> and he in the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, by his Feoffees in Trust, setles it on his Kinsman <HI>John Nash,</HI> and in his Family, I find it in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; and here for want of clearer Intelligence, I must leap to the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then the Fee-simple was invested in <HI>Roberts,</HI> and from this Family, about the latter end of that Princess, it went away by purchase to <HI>Moodye,</HI> who in our Fathers Memory alienated it to <HI>Samuel Ovenden,</HI> by whose Daughter and Co-heir <HI>Elizabeth Ovenden,</HI> it is now come to own the Heirs of her late Husband Mr. <HI>Partrich Tindall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spilsill-court</HI> is the last place of Account in this Parish, it was (as appears by very An∣cient Deeds) the Residence of a Family of that Name, which before the end of King <HI>Edward</HI> the second, was crumbled into Decay, and then the <HI>Stangraves</HI> suc∣ceeded in the Possession; for <HI>Robert de Stangrave</HI> at his Decease held some Estate at or in <HI>Spilsill,</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

But a∣bout the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was likewise mouldered away, and then it came to own the Signory of <HI>Maynie,</HI> descended from <HI>Walter de Medua∣na</HI> or <HI>Maynie,</HI> a man of that Repute, as appears by the red Book in the Exchecquer, <HI>Fol.</HI> 84. that he held twenty Knights Fees in this County: but <HI>Mayneys</HI> situated in <HI>Bredgar,</HI> was the Ancient Seat of this Name, who having possest for so many Successions and Descents this Seat, did not many years since transplant their Interest in it by Sale to <HI>Sharpeigh,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir it is now become the Inheritance of Mr. <HI>George Thompson</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Swalcliff</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blengate,</HI> was given by <HI>Eadbald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> as <HI>Thorn</HI> the Chronicler of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> informs me, to the Cloister of St. <HI>Mildred,</HI> at <HI>Minster</HI> in <HI>Thanett;</HI> and was, when her body was translated, by King <HI>Canutus,</HI> to the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> brought over along with it, and knit to the Patrimony of that Cloister: and the Monks of that Covent, granted it away to be held in Fee, by a Family which took its Denomination from thence, and were called <HI>Swalclive,</HI> and they held it the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as <HI>Testa de Nevill</HI> informs me, and paid an auxiliary Contribution for it, at the Marriage of <HI>Isa∣bell</HI> that Prince's Sister; but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, this Family was expired and then the Family of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> was setled in the Possession. <HI>Thomas de St. Law∣rence</HI> held it, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> kept in the Exchequer, in the twen∣tieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight, and dyed possest of it, in the twenty second year of that Prince, <HI>Rot.

And from him did it descend to his Grandchild <HI>Thomas St. Lawrence,</HI> who setled it in Marriage with <HI>Katharine</HI> his Daughter and Heir, matched to Sir <HI>William Apulder∣field,</HI> who determining in Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> one of them, espoused to Sir <HI>John Phineux,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, brought it to confesse the Signory of that Family: but, he deceasing without Issue-male, <HI>Jane</HI> his only Daughter and Sole Inheritrix, being matched to <HI>John Roper</HI> Esquire, this Mannor became by this Alliance, inoculated into his Patrimony, and was resident in this Name untill the Beginning of King <HI>James;</HI> and then it was conveyed to Mr. <HI>Benedict Barnham,</HI> by one of whose four Daughters and Coheirs, its Right and Title devol∣ved to <HI>Soam</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who not many years since, alienated his Concernment in it to <HI>Perry,</HI> who hath lately transmitted it by Sale to <HI>Gould.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 946. King <HI>Eadred</HI> gave Land at <HI>Swalclive</HI> to <HI>Heresigus</HI> one of his Ser∣vants, and he again gave it to the Abby of St <HI>Augustins</HI> conditionally, that a place of Sepulture might be reserved for him within their Cloister.</P>
<P><HI>Snave</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Aloes-Bridge, Ham</HI> and <HI>Newchurch,</HI> was as high as I can discover, a Portion or Member of that Patrimony, which confessed the Sig∣nory of <HI>Haut;</HI> and so continued, untill <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter and Coheir of Sir <HI>William Haut</HI> being made the Wife of the unhappy Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> a man of an unstained, though an unsuccesseful Virtue, this by Female Right became parcel of his Demeasne: but when he and his Patrimony were demolished by that impetuous Gust of Mis∣fortune, which sunk them both into a heap of Ruines, in the second year of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> this upon his Conviction of high Treason, being escheated to the Crown, that Princesse in the third year of her Government, passed it away to Sir <HI>Henry Sidney,</HI> Knight of the Garter, and Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose Successor the Right Honorable <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> not many years since conveyed it to Sir <HI>George Stonehouse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Snavewick</HI> in this Parish, was anciently wrapped up in the Demeasn, of the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> but being pared off in the general Suppression, by the rough Hand of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; It was in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted for Life only, to Sir <HI>Walter Henley:</HI> but upon his Decease it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill the late King <HI>Charls,</HI> about the Beginning of his reign, gran∣ted it to Mr. <HI>Patrick Black</HI> a Scotchman, who not long after, granted it in Lease to Sir <HI>Edw.

<P><HI>Swanscamp</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> hath contracted an eminent Character of Reputation, since <HI>Sueno</HI> or <HI>Swain</HI> fixed here his Camp, when he invaded <HI>England,</HI> to expiate by a plenary Revenge, that Blood, which in so prodigal an Effusion, was by <HI>Etheldred</HI> let loose from the Veins of his Danish Subjects, universally in this Nation; and certainly it was this <HI>Swain,</HI> that erected the Castle here to pre∣serve a Winter Station for his Ships, and though it now lye gasping in its own Rubbish, yet there are yet some Characters and Signatures remaining, which evidence and declare to us, that there was once a Fortresse there, where there is nothing
<PB N="307" REF="161"/>now but dismantled Ruines. The Tradition of the Country is, that, that Val∣ley which interposes between that Hill, which ascends up to <HI>Northfleet,</HI> and that which winds up to <HI>Swanscamp,</HI> was once covered with Water, and being locked in on each side with Hills, made a secure Road for Shipping, which invited the Dane to make it a Winter-Station for his Navy: and the same Report will tell you likewise, of Anchors which have been digged up about the utmost Verge of that Mersh, which is contiguous to the <HI>Thames,</HI> and certainly if we consider the Position of this Valley, which is nothing but a Chain of <HI>Mershland,</HI> interlaced with a Stream called <HI>Ebbs fleet,</HI> which swells and sinks with the Flux and Reflux of the adjacent River, and the Dimension of their Ships, then at that Time in use, which were not of any extraordinary Bulk, this Tradition is not improbable.</P>
<P>Near this place, <HI>Stigand</HI> the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Egelsine</HI> Abbot of St. <HI>Augustines,</HI> assembled the <HI>Kentish</HI> Men into an Army, pretending it was better to dye like Men in asserting and vindicating their Native Liberties, with. Swords in their Hands, then like Slaves to prostitute themselves to the Insolence of the Con∣querour, by a cheap and tame Submission with Halters about their Necks: which had so great an Influence and Impression upon their Spirits, that they resolved their Fran∣chises and themselves should find one Tomb together, rather then they would give up both, to the Sword and Will of an imperious Victor; and indeed soon after they ma∣naged their Stratagems with that Successe, that <HI>William</HI> Sirnamed the Conquerour, advancing with his <HI>Normans</HI> into <HI>Kent,</HI> to reduce <HI>Dover-Castle,</HI> which was then made good against him, he and his Army dropped into those Ambushes, which the <HI>Kentish</HI> Inhabitants had strewed for him, where he had indisputably perished, had he not by Charter fortified and confirmed those Immunities, they then contended and strug∣led for, and which remain unviolated either by any forrain or domestick Eruption even untill this Day.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Swanscamp</HI> it self, was, as farre as Record can guide us to disco∣ver, the Inheritance of the <HI>Montchensies,</HI> called in the Latine, Repertory <HI>de Monte-Canisio:</HI> and <HI>Hubert de Montchensey</HI> (as appears by <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book) was the first of that Name of any Eminence, who was Lord of the Fee; and after him his Son <HI>William de Montchensey,</HI> by paternal Right held it, and so dyed in Possession of it, in the year 1287; from whom it descended to <HI>Dionis</HI> his Daughter and Heir, and in Re∣lation to her, to her Husband, <HI>Hugh de Vere,</HI> who became by this Addition of Estate, thus accruing, Baron of <HI>Swanscamp,</HI> and sat, under that Notion, in the Parlia∣ment, which was summoned in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second: but he dying without Issue, <HI>William de Valence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> claimed it in Right of his Wife, Daughter and Heir to <HI>John de Montchensey,</HI> second Brother to <HI>William de Montchensey</HI> who was Father in Law to <HI>Hugh de Vere</HI> above-mentioned; from whom it descended to his Son <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> who dying without Issue, in the seventeenth year of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third, <HI>Isabell</HI> his Sister matched to <HI>Lawrence de Hastings,</HI> became his Heir, who in her Right was Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and Baron of <HI>Swanscamp;</HI> and left it to his Grandchild <HI>John de Hastings,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who dying without Issue, in the four∣teenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; in the fifteenth year of that Prince, <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> and <HI>Richard Talbot</HI> in respect of Marriage, were found to be his Heirs, and upon the Partition of the Estate, this was united to the Demeasne of <HI>Talbot,</HI> in which Family, after it had rested untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, it was conveyed to Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> of <HI>Bechworth</HI> Castle, whose Son Sir <HI>William Brown,</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, surrendered them into the hands of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, for the use of his Mother <HI>Cicely</HI> Dutchesse Dowager of <HI>York,</HI> upon whose Decease it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill the first year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was granted to <HI>Ralph Weldon</HI> Esq; great Grand-father to Colonel <HI>Ralph Weldon</HI> the in∣stant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Alcharden alias Combes</HI> is another place in this Parish, worthy this Survey. It was, many Hundred years since, the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Cumbe</HI> or <HI>Combe,</HI> who continued resident in the Possession, untill the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then it went away from them, by Sale to <HI>Swan</HI> of <HI>Hook</HI>-House in <HI>Southfleet,</HI> in which Family it was fixed, untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was convey∣ed to <HI>Lovelace,</HI> who not long after, passed it away to <HI>Carter,</HI> and he alienated it to

<P><HI>Staple</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> hath two places memorable: First, <HI>Crixall</HI> which was Anciently written <HI>Crickleaddshall,</HI> when in Ages of a higher Ascent it confessed the Family of <HI>Brockhull</HI> for its Owners, which were Lords of it but until the twenty eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and then it was setled upon a Daughter: but whether she brought it or not by Marriage to <HI>Wadham,</HI> which Family I find about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to have been possest of it, I cannot discover; and where the Light of Record is dim, I must acquiesce in silence. <HI>William Wadhaem,</HI> as I trace out by an old Pedigree of <HI>Fogg,</HI> lived in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, under the Scepter of which Princes he managed the Office of Justice of the Peace for the County of <HI>Somerset,</HI> and left his Estate here to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Nicholas Wadham,</HI> who determined in a Daughter and Heir, match∣ed to Sir <HI>William Fogg,</HI> by which Alliance this Mannor came to be ingrafted into the Inheritance of that Family, and rested there until the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was passed away by Sale from Sir <HI>John Fogg</HI> Knight, to <HI>Ralph Banister.</HI> In Times of a lower Descent, that is, about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> I find it by Court-rols possest by <HI>Tucker,</HI> who about the latter end of that Princess alienated his Concernment in it to <HI>Smith,</HI> who in our Fathers Remembrance trans∣planted the Title by Sale into Doctour <HI>Fotherbie</HI> Dean of <HI>Cantorbury,</HI> whose Son Mr. <HI>Charles Fotherbie</HI> continues now Proprietary of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Grove-place</HI> offers it self up to our Notice, as being the Habitation of a Knightly Family, called <HI>Grove,</HI> who in old Deeds are sometimes written, at-<HI>Grove,</HI> and sealed, as appears by the <HI>Labells</HI>-affixed to their Evidences, with <HI>three Escollops upon a Cheveron:</HI> In the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find it devolved by Descent to Sir <HI>John Grove,</HI> who was a great Benefactor to the Church of St. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Sandwich,</HI> where he lies buried with the Arms above-mentioned upon his Shield: but not long after, this Family determined in a Daughter and Heir, who linked this Seat to the Inheritance of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, con∣veyed it to <HI>Quilter,</HI> in which Name it was resident, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was passed away to <HI>Linch,</HI> and hath remained ever since in∣corporated into the Revenue of that Family: so that at present it is come down to Mr. <HI>John Linch,</HI> a Noble Confessor for the Interest of the Church, and Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>There is a Family in this Parish called <HI>Omer,</HI> which as appears by old Court-rols, Tombs, Deeds, and other Evidences, have been constantly resident almost four Hundred years.</P>
<P><HI>Seasalter</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Whitstaple,</HI> did belong to the Priory of <HI>Christ-church:</HI> but by whom it was given, the Records of that Covent are silent: only I find that it was part of that Revenue which supported their Diet and Table, and likewise I discover that Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the ninth, in the tenth year of his Papacy, by his Bull appropriated the Parsonage to the Priory above-mentioned, and likewise was granted for the better improving their Lively-hood and Subsistence. If you will see under what Notion it passed, in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, <HI>Doomesday</HI> Book will inform you, that it was valued upon the Terrier at two Carucats of Land, and upon the Appraisment was rated at five pound. This Mannor upon the Resigna∣tion
<PB N="309" REF="162"/>of that Estate, which related to the Convent abovesaid, into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was setled by that Prince on the newly erected Dean and Chapi∣ter of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> and there it remained, until these calamitous Times.</P>
<P><HI>Ellenden</HI> in this Parish belonged to the Abby of <HI>Feversham,</HI> and was (as the Lieger Book of that Covent informs me) given to the Monks of that Cloister by <HI>John Ellen∣den,</HI> and here it was incorporated and fixed, until the publick Dissolution unhinged, and unrooted it, and planted it in the Crown: and afterwards King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his Government granted it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Arden,</HI> misera∣bly afterwards assassinated by his Wife at <HI>Feversham;</HI> and he the same year conveyed it to <HI>John Nedeham,</HI> from whom it came over to his Son and Heir <HI>John Nedeham</HI> Gentleman, and he in the thirty second year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated it to Mr. <HI>Michael Beresford</HI> of <HI>Westerham,</HI> who not long after passed it away to Sir <HI>George Newman</HI> Doctour of the Civil Law, and Knighted in the sixteenth year of King <HI>James:</HI> and from him by successive Right, it is now descended to his Son and Heir <HI>George Newman</HI> of <HI>Rochester</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Seale</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Codsheath,</HI> was a Mannor which belonged to the Crown until the first year of King <HI>John,</HI> and then it was passed away by Grant to <HI>Baldwin de Betun</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemard;</HI> and <HI>Hawis</HI> his Daughter and Heir, by matching with <HI>William Mareschall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> incorporated it into his Demeasne: but <HI>Gilbert Ma∣reschall</HI> this mans Successor deceasing without Issue, <HI>Roger de Bigod</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> in Right of <HI>Mawde</HI> his Mother, who was Sister and Heir General to the abovesaid <HI>Gilbert,</HI> was setled in the possession of this Mannor, and he in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first by Gift or Donation transmits it to <HI>Otho</HI> Lord <HI>Grandison,</HI> a man certainly of great power in those Times; for, as it appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 4. <HI>Edwardi primi,</HI> he had a certain Agreement woven. of sundry Articles, and made between <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and the King of <HI>Castile,</HI> deposited in his Custody, in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; And in the fifth year of that Prince, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 5. <HI>in seedulâ,</HI> he had the Government of <HI>Jersey,</HI> assigned to his Care during Life; After this Fa∣mily of <HI>Grandison</HI> went out, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond (for <HI>Thomas de Grandison,</HI> dyed possest of <HI>Seale,</HI> in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Parte prima Num.</HI> 62) the noble Family of <HI>Brian</HI> of <HI>Holoway</HI> in <HI>Devon,</HI> was invested in the Possession, and Sir <HI>William Brian</HI> or <HI>Briene,</HI> for so he is styled on his Tomb, dyed possest of it in the year 1395, and lyes buryed in <HI>Seale</HI> Church, mailed in Armor, with a Huntsmans Horn at his Head: upon which the Conjecture of the Country is, that he was a great Hunter, when the Truth is, it was placed there, to signifie or denote the Tenure of some part of his Land, which was in <HI>Cornage.</HI> But to return: the next Family which succeeded <HI>Brian,</HI> in the Inheri∣tance of <HI>Seale,</HI> was the ancient Family of <HI>Fiennes,</HI> and this as I find by some Court-rolls, was in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and <HI>James Fiennes,</HI> second Son of <HI>William Fiennes</HI> Esquire, was, the first of <HI>March,</HI> in the twenty fifth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, summoned to the Parliament at <HI>Bury,</HI> as Baron of <HI>Say</HI> and <HI>Seale:</HI> but this place, after this newly atchieved Honor, continued not long in this Name; for <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Say,</HI> in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, passed it away to <HI>Geffrey Boleyne,</HI> Grand-father to Sir <HI>Thomas Boleyne,</HI> who was made Knight of the Garter, and Treasurer of the Kings House in the fifteenth, created Viscount <HI>Roch∣ford</HI> in the seventeenth, and lastly raised to the Earldome of <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and <HI>Ormond</HI> in the twenty first of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: but his infortunate Son <HI>George</HI> Viscount <HI>Rochford,</HI> being beheaded and leaving no Issue, it devolved to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in Right of Queen <HI>Anne</HI> her Mother one of the Sisters and Coheirs, and she in the first year of her reign, passes it by Grant to her Kinsman <HI>Henry Cary,</HI> whose Grandchild <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Earl of <HI>Dover</HI> alienated it by Sale to <HI>Richard Sackvill</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> who passed it away in our Fathers Memory to <HI>Richard Smith,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Dog Smith,</HI> and he not many years since deceasing without Issue bequeathed the Fee-simple of it to St <HI>Thomas</HI> Hospital in <HI>Southwarke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hall-place</HI> in <HI>Seale</HI> is a second place of Account, It was in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as an old Rentall discovers to me (and farther none of the an∣cient Evidences do reach) the Patrimony of <HI>Thomas Champneys,</HI> and he makes it over
<PB N="310" REF="163"/>in part to Sir <HI>William Wroth</HI> of <HI>Enfield,</HI> and he in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond, alienated all his Right and Interest in it to <HI>Thomas Lovell,</HI> but some part remained unsold untill the nineteenth of the abovesaid Prince, and then it was wholly invested by Sale from <HI>Robert Champneys,</HI> in the aforesaid <HI>Thomas Lovell,</HI> and he by his Feoffees in Trust, as namely <HI>John Osborne, John Arnold, Richard Marshall,</HI> and <HI>John Atsheath,</HI> conveyed it in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, to <HI>Thomas Theobald</HI> or <HI>Tebald,</HI> and <HI>Mawde</HI> his Wife, and so by this Purchase, did it become the Inheritance of this Family, and made its aboad here, untill the twenty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; and then <HI>John Theobald</HI> alienated it to <HI>William Porter,</HI> which Family it is probable were concerned in it before: for in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, I find <HI>John Alphey</HI> releases by Deed his right in <HI>Hall,</HI> to <HI>William Porter</HI> Esquire; and from <HI>William Porter</HI> abovesaid, did the Title slow down in the Chanel of paternal Right, to Mr. <HI>Andrew Porter,</HI> who concluding in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it is now by matching with her, become the Patrimony of Mr. <HI>Peter Stowell,</HI> Register of the Diocesse of <HI>Ro∣chester.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stidulfe</HI> is a third Mannor in <HI>Seale,</HI> which afforded both Seat and Sirname to a Fa∣mily so called. <HI>Robert de Stidulfe,</HI> is mentioned in Deeds without Date to have held this, and much other Land in <HI>Seale.</HI> In the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find, <HI>Reginald Stidulfe</HI> of <HI>Stidulfe,</HI> accounts with <HI>Thomas Champneis</HI> for Land held of his Mannor of <HI>Hall.</HI> And lastly I discover, that <HI>William Stidulfe,</HI> about the ele∣venth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, by Sale, conveyed it to <HI>William Quintin,</HI> whose Son <HI>William,</HI> changed the Name of <HI>Quintin</HI> into <HI>Oliver,</HI> upon what Grounds I have dis∣covered at <HI>Leybourn;</HI> and in this Name was this Mannor lodged untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was passed away to <HI>Richard Theobald,</HI> whose Son <HI>John,</HI> exchanged it with his Kinsman <HI>Stephen Theobald,</HI> who dying without Issue-male, left two Coheirs, <HI>Katharine</HI> matched to <HI>Edward Michell,</HI> and <HI>Mar∣garet</HI> wedded to <HI>David Polhill,</HI> who shared his Inheritance, and this upon the Division of the Estate, augmented the Revenue of <HI>Michell,</HI> and his Descendant Mr....... <HI>Michell,</HI> is now the Heir apparent of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sedingbourn</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> hath several places in its confines remark∣able, whereof <HI>Bayford</HI> and <HI>Goodneston</HI> first claim our Notice, the last of which had a Castle, whose Banks and Ruines are yet visible; it anciently acknowledged the Family of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who likewise in elder Times were possest of <HI>Bayford</HI> for Proprietaries. <HI>Robert de Nottingham</HI> flourished in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and dates several of his Deeds in the Beginning of that Prince's Rule, <HI>apud Ca∣stellum suum de Goodneston. Robert de Nottingham</HI> his Successor, was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the forty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shriovalty at <HI>Bay∣ford</HI> in <HI>Sedingbourn,</HI> in which year he dyed, and was found to have held at his Death, Lands at <HI>Sharsted, Pedding</HI> in <HI>Tenham,</HI> a place called <HI>Newland,</HI> and ano∣ther called <HI>la Herst, Higham</HI> in <HI>Milsted, Bixle</HI> in <HI>Tong,</HI> now called <HI>Bex,</HI> and last∣ly <HI>Goodneston</HI> and <HI>Babford,</HI> now named <HI>Bayford</HI> in this Parish, all which descended to his only Son <HI>John Nottingham;</HI> whose only Daughter and Heir <HI>Eleanor Not∣tingham,</HI> was matched to <HI>Simon Cheyney,</HI> second Son of Sir <HI>Richard Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Shurland,</HI> who brought all this spreading Revenue, to acknowledge the Signory of this Family, and the Coats of <HI>Cheyney</HI> and <HI>Nottingham, viz. Azure six Lions Argent, a Canton Ermin and Gules, two Pales wavee Argent</HI> stand empaled in <HI>Mil∣sted-church,</HI> in coloured Classe. But this Alliance, though it much enhaunsed by ad∣ditional improvement the Patrimony of <HI>Cheyney,</HI> yet could not so strongly entwine the Interest of <HI>Bayford</HI> and <HI>Goodneston</HI> with this Name: but that about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, they were conveyed away by Sale to <HI>Lovelace;</HI> for <HI>Richard Lovelace</HI> of <HI>Queenhith</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> a younger Branch of the <HI>Lovelaces</HI> of <HI>Bethersden,</HI> made his Will the first of <HI>Aprill</HI> 1465, and there ordained that his Feoffees should make an Estate of his Mannors of <HI>Bayford</HI> and <HI>Goodneston</HI> in <HI>Sedingbourn,</HI> which he had purchased of <HI>Cheyney,</HI> to <HI>John Lovelace</HI> his Son and Heir, which accordingly was performed, and he invested in the Possession of them; and from him did they by Descent devolve to his Crandchild <HI>Thomas Lovelace,</HI> of <HI>Kingsdown,</HI> who in the
<PB N="311" REF="163"/>tenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> passed them away to Mr. <HI>Ralph Finch;</HI> from which Fami∣ly they went away by the same Revolution, almost in our Fathers Memory to Alderman <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who had Issue Sir <HI>John Garret,</HI> of the County of <HI>Hertford,</HI> whose Widow Dowager the Lady ..... <HI>Garret</HI> by right of Jointure, now enjoys the Profits of both these Mannors.</P>
<P><HI>Chilton</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Sedingbourn,</HI> which had Owners of this Sirname, who likewise held another Mannor of this Name in <HI>Ash,</HI> both which places <HI>William de Chilton</HI> held at his Death, which was in the thirty first of <HI>Edward</HI> the first: but after his <HI>Exit,</HI> it did not long confesse the Propriety of this Family; for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it was demised by Sale to <HI>Corbie,</HI> and <HI>Robert Corbie</HI> was possest of it at his Decease, which was in the thirty ninth year of that Prince, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 9. and he had Issue <HI>Robert Corbie,</HI> whose Sole Daugh∣ter and Heir, <HI>Joan Corbie</HI> espoused Sir <HI>Nicholas Wotton,</HI> twice Lord Maior of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> by whom this Mannor and much other Land, came by a fruitfull Augmentation, to swell the Inheritance of this Family, yet I find the Interest in <HI>Chilton</HI> was not solely lodged in <HI>Corbie;</HI> for by ancient Deeds I discover that an old Family cal∣led <HI>Maris</HI> was concerned in some part of it likewise. <HI>John de Maris</HI> held a Knights Fee in <HI>Wicheling,</HI> and much other Land at <HI>Herietsham,</HI> the twentieth year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third, as likewise the Mannor of <HI>Ackmere</HI> in St. <HI>Mary Crey</HI> in Castle-guard of <HI>Dover-castle:</HI> and his great Grand-child <HI>William Maris,</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the twenty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and was Esquire to <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and after∣wards to <HI>Cardinall Kemp,</HI> and lyes enter'd in <HI>Preston</HI> Church, with so much of the Inscription left, as may instruct the Reader, that his Ashes slumber beneath the Tomb-stone: yet before his Decease he had alienated his share in this Mannor to <HI>Nicholas Wotton</HI> Esquire, from whom the united Interest of this place came down to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> who not many years since setled it in Marriage on <HI>Katherine</HI> his eldest Daughter, matched to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> Son and Heir to <HI>Philip</HI> Earl of <HI>Chesterfeild</HI> lately deceased, who still enjoyes the propriety of it.</P>
<P>In the year 1232. <HI>Henry</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> as <HI>Thomas Rudborne</HI> a Monk of St. <HI>Swithens</HI> in <HI>Winchester</HI> does relate, came on a Sabbath Day with much exultation out of <HI>Sedingbourn</HI> Church, and desired the people to express their Joy, because on that Day by the efficacious prayers of the Church, <HI>Richard</HI> the first, formerly King of <HI>England,</HI> and many others, were ransomed from the Flame and Torment of Pur∣gatory.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sedingbourn</HI> Church there was a Monument of Sir <HI>Richard Lovelace,</HI> inlayed richly with Brasse, who was an eminent Souldier in his Time, and Marshal of <HI>Ca∣lais,</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, with his Pourtraiture affixed in Brass, which the In∣juries of Time, and the Impiety of Sacrilegious Mechanicks, have utterly dis∣mantled and defaced.</P>
<P><HI>Selling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Boughton,</HI> did in Ages of the highest Discovery, acknow∣ledge the Signory of the <HI>Putots,</HI> and <HI>William de Putot</HI> was in Possession of it at his Death, which happened in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. After the <HI>Pu∣tots</HI> the Lords <HI>Badelesmer</HI> were invested in the possession. <HI>Guncelin de Badelesmer</HI> was possest of it, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 50. and left it with a spatious Inheritance to his Son <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> who having involved himself in a ruinous Combination with some others of the mutinous Nobility against <HI>Edward</HI> the second, lost both his Life and Estate in that unsuccesful Defection, but this Mannor was restored to his Son, in the second year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and was known by the Name of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer:</HI> but did not long enjoy his new acquired Inheritance; for in the twelfth year of the above-mentioned Prince, he died without Issue, and left his Estate to be shared be∣tween four Sisters and Co-heirs, whereof <HI>Margaret</HI> the eldest was espoused to Sir <HI>John Tiptoft,</HI> and he in her Right entered upon the possession of this place, and died possest of it, in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 39. from whom the Title came down to <HI>John Tiptoft,</HI> created Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> in the year 1450. and invested afterwards with the Office and Dignity of Lord Treasurer and Lord Constable of <HI>England:</HI> but asserting too eagerly the Cause and Quarrel of the
<PB N="312" REF="164"/>House of <HI>Yorke,</HI> he was crushed and overwhelmed with that weight, with which the Partisans of the <HI>Lancastrian</HI> Faction did endevour to sink and oppresse the Sup∣porters of that Family, and was offered up a Victime to the successful Fury of <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who being an Apostate of the House of <HI>Yorke,</HI> was the principal Engine upon whom the Designs and Interess of the <HI>Lancastrian</HI> Party then moved: Upon the untimely Death and attaint of this Earl, which was in the year 1570. this Mannor was annexed to the Revenue of the Crown, and though <HI>Edward Tiptoft</HI> this mans Son, was the next year after his Fathers unhappy <HI>Exit,</HI> restored by <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, both in Blood and Dignity; yet I do not discover any Restitution made of <HI>Selling;</HI> so that it rested in the Crown, until <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, in the fourth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <HI>Anthony St. Leger,</HI> who immediatly after passed it away to Sir <HI>Anthony Sonds</HI> of <HI>Throuley,</HI> one of the Justices of the Peace of this County, and Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to this Prince, and his Father <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, from whom it is now come down by Paternal efflux of the Title to Sir <HI>George Sonds</HI> Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> who is entituled to the present possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Oven-court</HI> in this Parish anciently gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family, which was known by that Denomination; but whether they were extracted from the <HI>Owens</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> and contracted this Name of <HI>Oven</HI> by vulgar Acceptation, no Record does manifest; certain it is they were, as appears by old Rentals and other Muniments, possessors of this place, as high as the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P>The next Family which (after this was worn out) did step into the possession, was <HI>Drilond</HI> of <HI>Cookes-ditch</HI> in <HI>Feversham,</HI> a Name of generous Extraction; for in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Stephen de Drilond,</HI> demises some Land at <HI>Crouchfeild</HI> in <HI>Feversham,</HI> by a Deed bearing Date from the twenty fifth year of that Prince, to <HI>William de Makenade,</HI> and in that Instrument he writes himself Knight. After <HI>Drilond</HI> was extinguished, which was about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, the <HI>Foggs</HI> became Proprietaries of it, and remained for divers years Lords of the Fee, until at last the alternate Devolution of Purchase brought it to be the Inheritance of <HI>Crouch,</HI> where it did not long fix, for in the year 1588. <HI>Giles Crouch</HI> alienated it to <HI>Michael Sonds</HI> Esquire, afterwards Knighted, from which Family in our Fathers Memory it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>Franklin,</HI> from whom the same Devolution hath brought it now to <HI>Lambe,</HI> who holds the instant Signory of it.</P>
<P>Before I passe from <HI>Selling,</HI> I must inform the Reader, that the greatest Honour which this Town acquired, was, that it was the Cradle of <HI>William Selling</HI> bred up amongst the Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> who obtained Licence from the Chapter of that Covent, to travel into <HI>Italy,</HI> and prosecute his Studies at <HI>Bononia,</HI> where he arrived to that perfection of Knowledge, that he was advanced to be Prior of <HI>Christ∣church,</HI> and was after sent by <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, in whose Eyes his Worth was very visible, as his Embassador to the Pope. Those incomparable Books, which were placed in the Library, which related to the Covent, by his Care and Munificence, amongst which was <HI>Tullies</HI> invaluable <HI>Tractate de Republica,</HI> not long after his Death, by an Accidental Fire, found an unhappy Sepulchre in their own Ashes. He died as full of Fame as of Years, in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1494. And hath his Epitaph re∣gistred by the industrious Pen of Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> in his Survey of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Smerden</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Calchill, Blackborne,</HI> and <HI>Barckley,</HI> did Anciently relate to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and was part of that Revenue which did keep up the Grandeur and Magnificence of that Sea, rescuing it from all cheapness and contempt, which induced <HI>John</HI> then Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> this being so eminent a part of the Spiritual Patrimony, to obtain a Grant of a Market to be observed here weekly on the Monday, as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 6. <HI>Edwardi tertii Num.</HI> 47.

<PB N="313" REF="164"/>because I can collect no farther Knowledge from original Evidences; I confess I am ignorant, so that I am forced to leap over divers Kings reigns into that of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then in the twenty fourth year of that Prince, I find that <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Stephen Rogers</HI> alienates it by Sale to <HI>Stephen Drayner,</HI> and it is probable <HI>Rogers</HI> purchased it of <HI>Norton,</HI> which Family, as appears by the <HI>Feudaries</HI> Book, held much Land here at <HI>Smerden,</HI> and at or near <HI>Romden:</HI> But to return; In <HI>Drayner</HI> the Interest of this place was fixed, until the seventeenth of Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> and then <HI>William Drayner</HI> passed it away by Sale to Sir <HI>Roger Manwood,</HI> and he in the eighteenth year of that Princess, alienates it again to <HI>Martin James</HI> Esquire, Remembrancer of the Exchecquer, and from him by the Devolution of successive and paternal Right, it is now come down to acknowledge the Propriety of Mr. .... <HI>James.</HI></P>

But before the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, this Family was shrunk into an Expiration, and then <HI>Walter Moile,</HI> who was a Judge in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, succeeded in the Possession, and he by a Fine, levied in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, demises it to <HI>Hugh Brent,</HI> from whom about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, it was conveyed to <HI>Cheyney,</HI> and in this Name it was fixed, until <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> in the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated it to <HI>Henry Nevill</HI> Lord <HI>Aburgavenny,</HI> who in the twenty ninth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> dying with∣out Issue-male; <HI>Mary Nevill</HI> was found to be his Sole Inheritrix, and she by match∣ing with Sir <HI>Thomas Vane</HI> knit this Mannor to his Patrimony: and his Son <HI>Francis Vane</HI> created Earl of <HI>Westmerland,</HI> in the twenty second of King <HI>James,</HI> alienated it in our Fathers Memory to <HI>Jackman,</HI> who not long after sold it to Sir <HI>Edward Hen∣den,</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchecquer, who upon his Decease gave it to his Ne∣phew Sir <HI>John Henden,</HI> whose Son and Heir <HI>Edward Henden</HI> Esquire, now enjoyes the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Smeth</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bircholt,</HI> hath in the Limits of it <HI>Scots-hall</HI> which is now and hath been for divers Descents the Inheritance of eminent Gentlemen of that Sirname, whom I dare aver, upon probable Grounds were originally called <HI>Balioll. William Balioll,</HI> second Brother to <HI>Alexander de Balioll,</HI> frequently writ his Name <HI>William de Balioll le Scot,</HI> and it is probable, that upon the Tragedy of <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Atholl,</HI> who was made prisoner by <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and barbarously executed, in the year 1307. (whilst he endevoured more nobly then successfully to defend the gasping Liberty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> against the Eruptions of that Prince;) this Family to decline the Fury of that Mo∣narch, who was a man of violent passions, altered the Name of <HI>Balioll,</HI> to that of their Extraction and Country, and assumed for the future the Name of <HI>Scot.</HI> That the Sirname of this Family was originally <HI>Balioll,</HI> I farther upon these Reasons as∣sert. First, the ancient Arms of <HI>Balioll</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> which was founded by <HI>John Balioll,</HI> and dedicated to St. <HI>Katharine,</HI> was a <HI>Katharin-Wheele,</HI> being still part of the paternal Coat of this Family. Secondly, <HI>David de Strabogie,</HI> who was Son and Heir to the infortunate Earl abovesaid, astonished with an Example of so much Terror, altered his Name from <HI>Balioll</HI> to <HI>Strabogie,</HI> which was a Signory which accrued to him in Right of his Wife, who was Daughter and Heir to <HI>John Comin</HI> Earl of <HI>Badzenoth</HI> and <HI>Strabogie,</HI> and by this Name King <HI>Edward</HI> the second, omitting that of <HI>Balioll,</HI> restored <HI>Chilham-castle</HI> to him for Life, in the fifteenth year of his reign. Thirdly, the Earls of <HI>Bucleugh,</HI> and the Barons of <HI>Burley</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who derive themselves originally from <HI>Balioll,</HI> are known at this instant by no other Sir∣name; but <HI>Scot,</HI> and bear, with some inconsiderable Difference, those very Arms which are at present the paternal Coat of this Family of <HI>Scots-hall.</HI> Having thus traced out the Name, I shall now represent a Scale of those eminent Persons, who have either directly or collaterally been extracted from <HI>Scots-hall.</HI> Sir <HI>William Scot,</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="165"/>who was knighted the tenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was Lord Chief Justice, and Knight Marshal of <HI>England,</HI> in the reign of that Prince. Sir <HI>Robert Scot</HI> was Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower,</HI> in the year 1424. Sir <HI>John Scot</HI> was Comptroller of the House, one of the Privy Councel to <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and Marshal of <HI>Calais. Thomas Scot</HI> who was first Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> next of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> Provost of <HI>Beverley,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>York,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Privy Councellor to King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, altered his Name from <HI>Scot</HI> to <HI>Rotheram,</HI> as being the place of his Education and Na∣tivity; but, it is probable, originally issued out from this Family. Sir <HI>William Scot,</HI> who was Son to Sir <HI>John</HI> above-mentioned, was Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports. Sir <HI>John Scot</HI> his Son, was knighted by the Prince of <HI>Castile,</HI> for signal Service perfor∣med by him, against the Duke of <HI>Gueldres.</HI> Sir <HI>Reginald Scot</HI> was Captain of the Castle of <HI>Callis.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Scot</HI> was Commander in Chief of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Forces, who assembled upon the plains by <HI>Northbourn,</HI> to oppose the Spanish Invasion, in the year 1588. All of which were either directly or collaterally Predecessors (being of the same Family) to <HI>Edward Scot,</HI> now Proprietary of <HI>Scots-hall</HI> Esquire, who was Son and Heir of Sir <HI>Edward Scot,</HI> who was made Knight of the Bath, at the Coro∣nation of K. <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thevegate</HI> is a second Mannor in this Parish, which was in elder Times, the Inheri∣tance of Gentlemen, of no mean Account in this Track. <HI>Robert de Passeley</HI> or <HI>Passelew,</HI> (for they are promiscuously so written) was Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> under <HI>Peter de Rivallis,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as <HI>Mat. Paris</HI> in the Life of that Prince does record. <HI>Edmund de Passeley,</HI> was with <HI>Edward</HI> the second, at <HI>Borough-Bridge</HI> in the seventeenth year, as the Pipe-roll of that Time, discovers; and probably was instrumental in the Defeat, given there to the Nobility then in Arms against that Prince; and from him this Mannor did descend to <HI>John Passeley</HI> Esquire, who in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, determined in <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his sole Heir, matched to <HI>Reginald Pimp</HI> Esquire, who likewise had the Fate to conclude in a Female Inheritrix called <HI>Ann,</HI> who was wedded to Sir <HI>John Scot,</HI> of <HI>Scots-hall,</HI> and Shee united <HI>Thevegate,</HI> to the Revenue of that Family; and from him is the Right of it by Descent transportted to his Successor <HI>Edward Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-hall,</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Smeth</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to it by the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,</P>
<P><HI>Shepebourn</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wrotham,</HI> was the Patrimony of an ancient Fa∣mily called <HI>Bavent,</HI> whose principal Estate lay in <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Surrey. Adam de Ba∣vent,</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Shepbourn,</HI> and in the thirteenth year of that Prince's reign, had as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 13. <HI>Edwardi primi, Memb.</HI> 28. a Grant of a Market weekly to this place, to be held on the <HI>Monday,</HI> and a Fair for three Days Space, at the Feast of St. <HI>Giles;</HI> and this <HI>Adam de Bavent</HI> or else his Son, was one of those eminent <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who was embarked with <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in his Expedition into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was one of those who were created Bannerets at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign. <HI>Roger de Bavent,</HI> was sum∣moned in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, to sit in Parliamennt as Ba∣ron; After whom I find no more mention of this Family, as Possessors of this Man∣nor: for it is probable, the Religion and muffled Perswasion of those Times, had so warped the Piety and Devotion of this Family, that they setled it on the Pri∣ory of <HI>Leeds:</HI> for by an old Rental of that Covent, I find it wrapped up in their Demeasn, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and remained parcel of their Income, until the general Shipwrack in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was in the thirty sixth year of that Prince, granted to Sir <HI>Ralph Vane,</HI> and <HI>Anthony Tustham</HI> Esquire, who not long after having passed away his Interest in it, to Sir <HI>Ralph Vane,</HI> it hath continued ever since, to acknowledge the absolute Signory of this Family so that the right of it now rests in Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> Son and Heir to Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> Se∣cretary of Estate to his late Majesty.</P>
<P><HI>Fairlane</HI> is an eminent Seat in this Parish, which likewise did confesse the Signory of the Family of <HI>Bavent;</HI> but before the latter end of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, they had abandoned the
<PB N="315" REF="165"/>Possession of it, and then it came to confesse the Signory of <HI>Colepepers,</HI> who remained Lords of the Fee, untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; and then it was trans∣mitted by Sale to <HI>Chown;</HI> in which Family after the Propriety had been constantly resident, untill that Age which almost was circumscribed within the Verge of our Remembrance, Sir <HI>George Chown</HI> the last of this Name at this place, desiring to con∣tract his Revenue solely within the Confines of <HI>Sussex,</HI> alienated his Estate here to Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> Comptroller of his late Majestie's Houshould, and principal Secreta∣ry of Estate, who having much beautified and adorned the ancient Fabrick with new Additions, upon his late Decease, bequeathed it to be enjoyed by his Lady Dowager.</P>
<P><HI>Stelling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Lovingborough,</HI> was with <HI>Wadenhall</HI> (which lyes partly in this Parish, and partly in <HI>Petham</HI>) parcell of the Inheritance of the illustrious Fa∣mily of <HI>Haut;</HI> and <HI>William de Haut</HI> had <HI>Stelling</HI> and <HI>Wadenhall</HI> in the first year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the first, and this above-mentioned <HI>VVilliam</HI> founded a Chappel at <HI>VVadenhall,</HI> and de∣dicated it to St. <HI>Edmund</HI> the Saxon King of the East Angles, and in this Family these Mannors continued untill the latter end of the reign of <HI>H.</HI> the sixth, and then <HI>VVill. Haut,</HI> lineally extracted from the above-said <HI>VVilliam,</HI> conveyed <HI>Stelling</HI> to <HI>Humphrey Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> and this being forseited to the Crown, upon the At∣tainder of his Grandchild <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this lay enwrapped in the royal Revenue, untill Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in the first year of her reign, granted it with much other Land to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clin∣ton,</HI> who about the last year of that Princesse, alienated it to Mr. <HI>Henry Herdson,</HI> whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>Francis Herdson,</HI> about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away to Mr. <HI>John Herdson</HI> his Uncle, who dying without Issue, disposed of it by Will to his Nephew Sir <HI>Basill Dixwell</HI> of <HI>Terlingham</HI> in <HI>Folkstone;</HI> from whom by descendant Devolution, it is now come down to his Heir General Mr. <HI>Basill Dixwell</HI> of <HI>Broom</HI> in <HI>Barham.</HI> But <HI>VVadenhall</HI> remained in the Name of <HI>Haut,</HI> untill by the Steps of several Descents, it was wafted along to Sir <HI>VVilliam Haut,</HI> one of whose two Daughters and Coheirs called <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> being wedded to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> brought it to acknowledge the Interest of that Fa∣mily; and he having exchanged it with <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, it confessed the Signory of the Crown, untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the forty second year of her reign, granted it to Sir <HI>John Sotherton,</HI> Baron of her Exchequer, whose Heir, in the memory of these Times, gave up his Right in it by the Fatality of Sale, to Mr. <HI>Benjamin Pere</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>The Advowson of the two Parsonages, or Rectories of <HI>Stelling</HI> and <HI>Ʋpper Hardres,</HI> were granted to the Priory of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the twenty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Pat.</HI> 3. <HI>part</HI> 2. <HI>Memb.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Selling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Street,</HI> hath several places in it which cannot be declined without some Memorial: <HI>Willmington</HI> and <HI>Somervill,</HI> are the first that occurre, and they gave Seat, and one of them Sirname, to a Family of Repute in that Age, be∣cause I find they had Land in other places in the County. <HI>Roger de Wilmington,</HI> held the Possession of them at his Death, which was in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left his Estate here and elsewhere, to be shared between his four Daugh∣ters and Coheirs, matched to <HI>Ordmere, Bromming, Brockhull</HI> and St. <HI>Laurence;</HI> but upon the Division of the Estate, these accrued to St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and in Right of pa∣ternal Devolution, <HI>John St. Laurence,</HI> Son of <HI>Thomas St. Laurence,</HI> held these at his Decease, which was in the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and from him their right devolved to his Son <HI>Thomas St. Laurence,</HI> whose Sole Daughter and Heir <HI>Katharine,</HI> brought them to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>William Apulderfield;</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, passed them away to <HI>Ashburnham</HI> and <HI>Till:</HI> and the first of those, having wholly setled his Right in them by Sale in <HI>Till,</HI> they rested in this Family, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then <HI>Peter Heyman</HI> Esquire, having wedded the sole Inheritrix of <HI>Till,</HI> they were transplanted into the Patrimony of that Family; and from him the Propriety descended to his great Grandchild my worthy Friend Sir <HI>Henry Heyman</HI> Baronet, lately deceased.</P>
<PB N="316" REF="166"/>
<P><HI>Haringe</HI> is a second place of Consideration: it was, as high as any Clew of Record can lead us, the Possession of the <HI>Gurneys. Hugh de Gurney,</HI> who is in the Register of those who entered <HI>England,</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman,</HI> held it under his Scepter. In Ages almost of the next Step or Descent, the <HI>Sharsteds</HI> had it; and <HI>Robert de Shar∣sted,</HI> who flourished under <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and dyed in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was possest of it at his Decease; but this Name was suddenly worn out, for in the Time subsequent to this, <HI>Henry Brockhull</HI> of <HI>Brockhull</HI> in <HI>Saltwood</HI> enjoyed it, who likewise had some Interest in <HI>Wilmington</HI> and <HI>Somervill,</HI> which his Successor sold to <HI>Ashburnham;</HI> and here the Propriety made its aboad, un∣till the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Inglethorp;</HI> and to the Demeasne of this Name it was linked, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; and then it was wafted over by Sale to <HI>Morton;</HI> and here the Title lodged untill our Grand-fathers memory; and then it was alienated to <HI>Willonghbie;</HI> and Sir <HI>Francis Willoughbie,</HI> sold his Concernment in it to <HI>Ralph Heyman</HI> Esquire; from whom it came over to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Peter Heyman,</HI> who some years since upon the Marriage of his second Son <HI>Peter Heyman,</HI> setled it on him, whom yet it owns for, Proprietary.</P>
<P><HI>Hodiford</HI> is the last place of any Estimate: In elder Times a Family was setled here which borrowed its Sirname, as it did its Residence, from this Mansion; for <HI>John Ho∣diford</HI> or <HI>Hodinorth,</HI> was Lord of the Demeasne: but when this Name departed from this place, the <HI>Cardens</HI> were the next in order, who were Possessors of the Fee; from whom by the Vicissitude of Sale, it was transmitted to <HI>Cobbe,</HI> where the Title had not long been lodged, but it was by the like Devolution, conveyed by <HI>James Cobbe</HI> the last of the Name who enjoyed it, to <HI>Thomas Godfrey</HI> Esquire; a Person to whom by several Engagements both of Learning and Friendship, I stand now ob∣liged.</P>
<P><HI>Shelvich</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was formerly the Patrimony of <HI>Atleeze,</HI> a Family of no contemptible Value in this Circuit, who layd the Foundation of a House near the <HI>Leas,</HI> and from its Situation extracted their Sirname: but the greatest Honor which accrued to this House in elder Times, was, that it was the Cradle of Sir <HI>Richard Atleeze,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and several times a Member or Burgesse of those Parliaments, which assembled in that Age: but dying without Issue, <HI>Marcellus Atleeze,</HI> his only Brother be∣came his Heir, but he not long after made his <HI>Exit,</HI> in two Daughters and Co∣heirs, whereof <HI>Lucy</HI> the eldest was matched to <HI>John Norton</HI> Esquire, and <HI>Cicely</HI> the youngest, was wedded to <HI>Valentine Barret</HI> of <HI>Perry-court:</HI> but <HI>Norton</HI> upon the Divi∣sion of the Estate, was in his Wifes Right, entituled to this Mannor; and in this Family, after the Title had for many discents resided, it was by an ever Thread of Succession, gui∣ded down to Sir <HI>Thomas Norton</HI> of <HI>Milton;</HI> who not many years since, passed it away to Sir <HI>Richard Sonds,</HI> originally extracted from an ancient Family, which about the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, had their Habitation at <HI>Sonds-place</HI> at <HI>Darkin</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> whose Son and Heir Sir <HI>George Sonds,</HI> Knight of the Bath, by Discent from him, claims the Interest and Signory of it, and hath upon the old Foundation of <HI>Leeze</HI>-Court, erected a Pile so set out with all the cunning and Pomp of Magnificence, that it is scarcely to be out-rivalled by a Fabrick of that Bulk, in any part of the <HI>English</HI> Nation. Sir <HI>Richard Atleeze,</HI> lyes entombed in <HI>Shelvich</HI> Church, under a fair Gravestone, with his Portraicture in Brasse annexed, as likewise that of his Lady, as fairly insculped, with this Epitaph affixed to both their Figures. <HI>Hic jacet Dominus Ricardus Atleese Miles, ac Domina Dionisia uxor ejus, qui quidem Ricardus obiit Anno Dom.</HI> 1394.</P>
<P><HI>Coperhams-Sole</HI> in this Parish, for several Centuries of years, hath confessed the <HI>Belks</HI> to have been its Proprietaries: who it is probable extracted their Name out of <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the Name is yet spreading, and the Family noble and numerous. <HI>Stephen de Belk</HI> is mentioned in <HI>Testa de Nevill,</HI> a Book kept in the Exchequer, to have paid respective Aid for Land which he held in this Track, at the Marriage of <HI>Isabell</HI> Sister to <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the twentieth year of that Prince's reign, which is enough to justifie the Antiquity of this Family in this Track.</P>
<PB N="317" REF="166"/>
<P><HI>Shepeards Forstall</HI> was for many Descents the possessionof a Family called <HI>Ruck,</HI> one of whom lies entombed at <HI>Rye,</HI> and was an eminent Person, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, being Bow-bearer to that Prince, and bore for his Coat Armour, as it appears affixed to his Grave-stone, <HI>Sables a plain Crosse Argent between four Flower de Lis Or.</HI> The last of this Name which held this place, was <HI>Nicholas Rucks,</HI> who about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> dying without Issue, gave it to his Nephew Mr. <HI>Nicholas Oliver,</HI> who hath lately passed it away by Sale to the Colledge of <HI>Al∣soules</HI> in <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lords</HI> is the last place of Account in <HI>Shelvich:</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it had Owners of that Sirname: but ever since the latter part of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it hath constantly acknowledged the Family of <HI>Giles,</HI> until this present, to have been its successive proprietaries. One of this Family, called <HI>Alexander Giles,</HI> was Steward to the Abbot of <HI>Lesnes,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and I have seen a Release under his Hand and Seal, given to one <HI>John VValden</HI> of <HI>Erith,</HI> in the twenty fifth of the abovesaid Prince, for some Services due from that Person of the Covent abovesaid.</P>
<P><HI>Sevington</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge,</HI> was, in Ages of as high as any Record can step to, the <HI>Barrie's,</HI> a Family of great Antiquity in this Track. Sir <HI>Robert de Barrie</HI> is in the Register of those, who were engaged in <HI>Ireland,</HI> under <HI>Henry</HI> the second, where he was the first, as Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> reports, which man'd and brought the Hawk to hand; and grew up to that Repute, as he was called by the <HI>Irish Barriemore,</HI> or the great <HI>Barrie. William de Barrie,</HI> this mans Successor, was one of the <HI>Recognitores Magnae Assisae,</HI> for this County, in the Time of King <HI>John,</HI> and lived at the <HI>Moat</HI> in this Parish, where many of his Successors, who were Lievtenants of <HI>Dover-castle,</HI> and Conservators of the Peace in <HI>Kent,</HI> had their Re∣sidence: the last of whom was <HI>Robert Barrie,</HI> whose Female Heir brought this Man∣nor to <HI>Radcliff,</HI> and he not many years since conveyed the <HI>Moat</HI> to <HI>Alcock,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir it is now united to the Demeasne of <HI>Bois.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sevenoke</HI> is like a Fountain which streams into several places of Note, which we cannot passe by without some Consideration. The first is <HI>Blackhall,</HI> which was the pos∣session of a Family called <HI>Totihurst:</HI> the first whom I find possest of it was <HI>William de Totihurst,</HI> and he flourished here, as appears by the ancient Court-rols, a great part of the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second. The next whom I find by the same Evidences setled in the Inheritance, is <HI>Thomas Totihurst,</HI> and he held it in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and had Issue <HI>Robert Totihurst,</HI> who was, as appears by an Inscription upon his Tomb, Servant to Cardinal <HI>Bour∣chier,</HI> and died possest of this Mannor, in the year 1512. and transmitted it to his Son <HI>Thomas Totihurst</HI> Esquire, Justice of Peace of this County, who about the be∣ginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated it to Sir ...... <HI>Boswell</HI> Grand-father to Sir <HI>Leonard Boswell,</HI> who dying without Issue, his Sister the Lady ...... <HI>Boswell,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>William Boswell,</HI> as Heir General to her Brother, is now entered up∣on it.</P>
<P><HI>Brabourne</HI> is the second place of Account. The first whom I find possest it, was <HI>Baldwin de Betun</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemarle. Falcatius de Brent,</HI> who so vigorously asser∣ted the Cause and Quarrel of King <HI>John</HI> against his Barons, and afterwards merited very much of his Son <HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the Battle of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> where a considera∣ble part of those Forces which <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dolphin</HI> of <HI>France</HI> had transported into <HI>En∣gland,</HI> to support the Confederacie of the Seditious Barons, was dissipated and dis∣comfited. But afterwards, all National Animosities being charmed into Slumber by a general Peace, he desiring still to improve the Flame of War since from that he expected both Heat and Light, seised on the Castle of <HI>Bedford,</HI> which was not wrung from him without the Expence of much Blood and Treasure: to expiate which Crime, his Estate here and else where, was in the fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, forfeited to the Crown, as being the Price of so great an Insolence: And then the abovesaid Monarch granted it wholly to <HI>Baldwin de Betun</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemarle:</HI> and <HI>Hawis</HI> his Daughter and Co-heir, brought it to her Husband <HI>William Mareschall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke:</HI> but <HI>Gilbert Mareschall</HI> this mans Successor, dying without Issue,
<PB N="318" REF="167"/><HI>Roger de Bigod</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk;</HI> in Right of <HI>Mawde</HI> his Mother, who was his Sister and Heir, entered upon it, and he, in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, gives it to <HI>Otho</HI> Lord <HI>Grandison.</HI> After this Family was worn out, I find by an ancient Court∣roll, one <HI>Walter de Pevenley</HI> or <HI>Pemley,</HI> possest of it, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and he it is possible erected the House, which in old Deeds is written <HI>Peven∣ley</HI> or <HI>Pemley-court.</HI> But, before the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, this Family was extinguished and gone, and then the <HI>Ashe's</HI> were the succeeding Proprietaries, a Fa∣mily which before were Lords of much Land in this Track, and in ancient Deeds were written <HI>de Fraxino,</HI> from their Habitation near some place planted with those Trees; and it is probable derived their Descent from <HI>Thomas de Esse,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Recognitores Magnae Assisae,</HI> in the fourth year of King <HI>John,</HI> as appears by the Pipe-rols of that Time: and certainly to this Name did a considerable part of the Fabrick of the House owe its first Original, as appears by the Coat in divers of the Windows, <HI>videlicet, Azure three Cheverons Argent.</HI> In fine, after this Seat and Mannor had for many years been resident in this Family, it was about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated to Sir ...... <HI>Boswell,</HI> whose Grand-child dying without Issue, his Sister the Lady <HI>Margaret Boswell,</HI> is now become the Heir Ge∣neral of this place.</P>
<P><HI>Rumpsted</HI> and in very old Evidences written <HI>Rumpshot,</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family, which was known by that Sirname. It is superfluous to inform the World how many, by old Deeds, are represented to have been possessors of this place, a∣mongst whom Sir <HI>William de Rumpsted</HI> is most eminent, who flourished here, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and, as the constant and successive Tradition of the Inha∣bitants of this Parish is, was Foster-father to <HI>William de Sevenoke,</HI> who was found a desolate and forlorn Orphan in the hollow Body of an Oake, and received both Reception and Education from the Charity and Benevolence of the above-mentioned Person: In whose Lineage the propriety of this place did not long after settle; for by an old Court-roll, I find it in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the Tenure of <HI>Ni∣sell:</HI> but this Family not long after determining in a Female Heir, she by matching with <HI>Bere,</HI> brought it to acknowledge it self to be of the Interest of this Family, but staid not long in the Name; for about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was made by purchase the possession of <HI>Peckham,</HI> from whom not many years after, by the same fatality it went away to <HI>Bedell. Nicholas Bedell,</HI> in the third and fourth of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> demised it to <HI>John Stacy</HI> of <HI>Hollenden,</HI> and <HI>John Stacy,</HI> in the fourth and fifth of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> conveyes it to <HI>Richard Lone,</HI> and his Successor Mr. <HI>Richard Lone</HI> hath very lately by Sale transmitted his Interest here to <HI>Thomas Lambert,</HI> formerly of <HI>West-Combe</HI> in <HI>Greenwich</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Knoll</HI> is the last place of Account in <HI>Sevenoke:</HI> It had, in Times of elder Inscription, the same Owners with <HI>Brabourne,</HI> and <HI>Seale,</HI> not far distant, as namely, <HI>Falcatius de brent, Baldwin de Betun</HI> Earl of <HI>Albemarle, William Mareschall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Roger de Bigod</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, granted it with <HI>Seale,</HI> and much other Land, which devolved to him in Right of <HI>Mawde</HI> his Mother, who was Sister and Heir to her Brother <HI>Gilbert le Mareschall</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> to <HI>Otho de Grandison,</HI> and in his Descendants did it continue until the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was conveyed by Sir <HI>Thomas Grandison</HI> to <HI>Geffrey de Say;</HI> yet I do not find that the possession of this place was entirely plan∣ted in <HI>Grandison,</HI> for an Inquisition taken after the Death of <HI>Reginald de Cobham,</HI> in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 62. <HI>Parte primâ,</HI> represents him to have had some share or concernment in it; yet how ever it were thus broken into parcels, the Inheritance of this Mannor, was wholly, after this, placed in <HI>Geffrey de Say,</HI> as appears by some Court-rols, which commence from the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond: but he determining in Daughters and Co-heirs, <HI>Joan</HI> one of them upon the Division of his Estate, brought this as an Addition to the Patrimony of her Husband Sir <HI>William Fiennes:</HI> and in this Family, when the possession had had a Respite, un∣til the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, it was by Sir <HI>William Fiennes</HI> passed away by Sale to <HI>Thomas Bourchier</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who added much of Pompe and Magnificence, by a new Supplement or Superstructure to the ancient Pile or Fabrick, and dying bequeathed it to the See of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as a convenient Pallace for his
<PB N="319" REF="167"/>Successors: but when <HI>William Warham</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, saw that the Grandeur of this Mansion was looked upon both with an Eye of Emulation and Envy, by the Laity of those Times, he to allay that Murmure and Regret, in the twelfth year of the abovesaid Prince, exchanged it with the Crown: and here it rested, until <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, in the second year of his reign, granted it to <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> Protector of the Realm, in the Minority of that Prince. Who being convicted of Felony, in the fourth year of that King, it escheated back to the Crown: and then it was in that year, by a new Grant, setled on <HI>John Dudley</HI> Duke of <HI>Northumberland:</HI> but he being intoxi∣cated with the Fumes of Ambition, broke out into such treasonable and seditious practises, against the Right and Title of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> that they could not be ex∣plated, but with the Losse of his Life, and Forfeiture of his Estate: and then this Seat upon his unsuccessful <HI>Exit,</HI> returning to the Crown, it was by the abovesaid Princess granted to her Cousin <HI>Reginald Poole</HI> Cardinal, for his Life, and a year after, as he should by Testament dispose. After his Death, it reverts again to the Crown, and then Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the third year of her reign, grants it to <HI>Robert Dud∣ley</HI> Earl of <HI>Leiceister,</HI> and he the same year resigning it back into the Hands of his Soveraign, it was by Lease made over to <HI>John Lennard</HI> of <HI>Chevening</HI> Esquire: but the Fee-simple was by Royal Concession invested, in the seventh year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in <HI>Thomas Sackvill</HI> Lord <HI>Buckhurst,</HI> and his Grand-child <HI>Richard Sack∣vill</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> almost in our Remembrance, conveyed the Fee-simple (reser∣ving it yet still in Lease to himself and his Heirs, paying such a Rent-charge, as is there specified, for ninety and nine years) to Mr. <HI>Richard Smith,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Dog-Smith:</HI> who upon his Decease, not many years since, setled the propriety of it for ever upon St. <HI>Thomas</HI> Hospital in <HI>Southwarke.</HI></P>
<P>The Honour of <HI>Sevenoke</HI> was granted by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to her Kinsman <HI>Henry Carey</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> in the first year of her reign, from whom it devolved to his Grand-child <HI>Henry Carey</HI> Earl of <HI>Dover:</HI> he passed it away by Sale to <HI>Richard Sackvill</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> who alienated his Interest in it to Mr. <HI>Richard Smith,</HI> who upon his above-mentioned Decease, gave it with <HI>Knoll,</HI> which both were exchanged, and so united to the Royal Demeasne by <HI>William Warham,</HI> to the Hospital of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Southwarke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kepington</HI> is the last place considerable in this Parish, which was wrapt up in that Demeasne, which owned the Signory of the Lords <HI>Cobham</HI> of <HI>Cobham,</HI> as appears by an Inquisition taken, in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 62. <HI>Parte secundâ,</HI> and after a Decursion of several Descents, came by the Heir Ge∣neral of this Family, to be possest by <HI>Brook,</HI> whose Descendant, about the begin∣ning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Burges,</HI> and by his Sister and Heir it came over to <HI>Hanger,</HI> who alienated it to <HI>Cowper,</HI> and he not long since to Mr. <HI>Thomas Farnaby.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Spelherst</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Somerden, Codsheath,</HI> and <HI>Watchling stone,</HI> hath many places in it of Repute. First, <HI>Grome-bridge</HI> which is a Chappel of Ease belonging to <HI>Spel∣herst,</HI> and is dedicated to St. <HI>John:</HI> it is in old Registers written <HI>Gromen-bridge,</HI> and <HI>Gormen-bridge</HI> from some <HI>Saxon,</HI> who was anciently Owner of it, as <HI>Godmanchester</HI> in <HI>Huntingtonshire,</HI> upon the same Account, in old Orthography, bears the Name of <HI>Gormonchester,</HI> a <HI>Saxon</HI> having been possessor of it of that Denomination. This Mannor in elder Times confessed the Dominion and Title of the Noble Family of <HI>Cobham: Henry de Cobham,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> his Wife, obtained a Market to be observed weekly on the Thursday, and a Fair three Dayes yearly, <HI>videlicet,</HI> the <HI>Vigil,</HI> the Day of St. <HI>John Port-latine,</HI> and the Day after, as is manifest from an old Charter, which I have seen, whose Date commences from the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, the Market and Fair were kept, where now the new Chappel is erected by the piety and expence of that Worthy Patriot <HI>John Packer</HI> Esquire, late one of the Clerks of the Privy Seal. After the <HI>Cobhams</HI> were departed from the possession of this place, the Lords <HI>Clinton</HI> became, by purchase, Proprietaries of it: and <HI>John de Clinton,</HI> who was often summoned to fit as Baron in Parliament, in the Time of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, died possest of it, in the twenty second year of that Prince,
<PB N="320" REF="168"/><HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 16. from whom the Title flowed in this Family, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was passed away to <HI>Waller</HI> of <HI>Lamberherst,</HI> where, and in <HI>Sussex</HI> they were before Masters of very ample Possessions; for <HI>Thomas Waller,</HI> and <HI>Katharine</HI> his Wife, granted to <HI>Thomas Waller</HI> of <HI>Lamberherst</HI> his Father, <HI>Richard Brenchley</HI> and <HI>John Brook,</HI> all his Lands, Messuages, and Tenements, in the Villa∣ges and Parishes of <HI>Rotherfeild, Witheham, Wadhurst; Lamberhurst, Little Horsted, Alfricheston,</HI> and <HI>Bucksted,</HI> together with the moiety of the Advouson of the Church of <HI>Little Horsted,</HI> as appears, <HI>Claus.</HI> 11. <HI>Richardi secundi in Dorso Memb.</HI> 35. <HI>Richard Waller</HI> Esquire, was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the sixteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and kept his Shrievalty at <HI>Grome-bridge,</HI> and was before Sheriff of <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> in the twelfth year of that Prince. This is that renowned Souldier, that in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, took <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> Army Prisoner at the Battle of <HI>Agin-court,</HI> brought him over into <HI>England,</HI> and held him in honora∣ble Restraint or Custody at <HI>Grome-bridge,</HI> which a Manuscript in the Heralds-Office notes to be twenty four years: in the Time of which his Recess, he newly erected the House at <HI>Grome-bridge</HI> upon the old Foundation, and was a Benefactor to the re∣pair of <HI>Spelherst</HI> Church, where his Arms remain in Stone-work over the Church∣porch: but, lest such a signal peece of Service might remain entombed in the Se∣pulchre of unthankful forgetfulness, the Prince to convey the Memory of this glo∣rious Action to Posterity, assigned to this <HI>Richard Waller,</HI> and his Heirs for ever, an additional Crest, <HI>videlicet,</HI> the <HI>Arms</HI> or <HI>Escocheon</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> hanging by a <HI>Labell</HI> on an <HI>Oake,</HI> with this <HI>Motto</HI> affixed, <HI>Hae Fructus Virtutis.</HI> This <HI>Richard</HI> was great Grand-father to <HI>William VValler</HI> of <HI>Grome-bridge</HI> Esquire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the twen∣ty second of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and he was Father to Sir <HI>VValter VValler,</HI> who was Grand-father to Sir <HI>VVilliam VValler</HI> now possessor of <HI>Winchester-castle,</HI> and Father of Sir <HI>Thomas Waller:</HI> which Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> almost in our Fathers Memory, passed away <HI>Grome-bridge</HI> to <HI>Thomas Sackville</HI> Earl of <HI>Donset,</HI> whose Grand-child <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> not many years since conveyed it to <HI>John Packer</HI> Esquire, Father to ...... <HI>Packer</HI> Esquire, now possessor of this place.</P>
<P>There was a Chauntry founded at <HI>Grome-bridge,</HI> in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, by <HI>VVilliam Russell,</HI> and <HI>Hawis</HI> his Wife, as appears by the first Book of Compositions <HI>in Registro Roffensi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hollands</HI> in this Parish next cals for a View: It was, in Ages of a very high Date, the Patrimony of a Noble Family of that Sirname, and are in the Chartularies of this Parish, recorded to have been great Benefactors to the Church of <HI>Spelherst,</HI> and were allied to <HI>Thomas Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> who matched with <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter of <HI>Edmund</HI> of <HI>VVoodstock:</HI> but, before the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, this Family was worn out, and vanished, and then the <HI>VVallers</HI> stepped into the possession, in which Family the Right of it did many years reside, until it was in our Fathers Memory alie∣nated to <HI>Thomas Sackville</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> from whose Successor it passed away by Sale to <HI>Lindsey,</HI> and from him, not many years since, the like Revolution carried it off to <HI>Caldicot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ferbies</HI> is another Seat of no vulgar Consideration in <HI>Spelherst,</HI> if we consider that it gave Sirname to a Family of important Account in this Track, who had their ancient Residence at this place, and sealed as high as <HI>Edward</HI> the third, with a <HI>Fesse Ermin between three Goats heads erased, in Labells affixed to their Deeds,</HI> which was the Paternal Coat-Armour of <HI>John de Fereby</HI> (for so is the Name written in ancient Muniments) who flourished, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third. But this mans Posterity being desirous to transplant themselves to <HI>Pauls Crey,</HI> where they had before purchased Lands, called-<HI>Hokinden</HI> of <HI>Dynley,</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, conveyed that Estate they had here, about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, to <HI>Waller</HI> of <HI>Grome-bridge,</HI> and continued for many years folded up in the Revenue of that Family, until very lately it varied its Possessor, being by pur∣chase made the Inheritance of Alderman <HI>Chiverton</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rust-hall</HI> in this Parish, had likewise Proprietaries of that Sirname, one of which Family called <HI>John Rust,</HI> was Maior of <HI>Feversham,</HI> in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and there lyes entombed, and about that Age. this Family surrendered their Concernment here by Sale to <HI>Waller,</HI> in which Name it resided, untill the forty second
<PB N="321" REF="168"/>year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was conveyed by <HI>Richard Waller</HI> Esquire, to Mr. <HI>George Stacy;</HI> who not long after passed it away to <HI>Bing,</HI> in which Family the Possession is at this instant fixed.</P>
<P><HI>Ewherst</HI> is the last place which must be mentioned, and indeed it is worth our Re∣cording, because this and <HI>Read</HI> in <HI>Marden,</HI> was the ancient Patrimony of <HI>Read,</HI> many Discents before. Sir <HI>Robert Read</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, transplanted himself to <HI>Chiddingstone,</HI> by matching with the Coheir of <HI>Alphew,</HI> yet still remained Possessor of this place, which he transmit∣ted with <HI>Katharine</HI> one of his four Daughters and Coheirs, matched with Sir <HI>Thomas Willoughbie,</HI> and after the Title had been knit to this Family, by the Links of some Discents, it was by Sale not long since transferred to <HI>Knight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Siberts-would</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Shepeards-well,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Bewsborough,</HI> and hath two places in it worth our Notice. The first is <HI>West-court,</HI> which was given (as the Records of <HI>Christ-church</HI> testifie) to <HI>Alfric</HI> the Abbot, by King <HI>Etheldred</HI> in the year 944, and conveyed not long after by <HI>Scotlandus</HI> the Abbot his Successor, to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and hath been ever since as a Limbe or Branch of that See.</P>
<P><HI>Upton-court</HI> is a second place of Repute. Several old datelesse Deeds discover to us, that it was in elder Times the Patrimony of a Family called <HI>Ʋpton:</HI> from whom it is probable, that the <HI>Ʋptons</HI> of <HI>Feversham,</HI> who for many years have flourished there under a fair Estimate of Antiquity, were originally descended: but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was crumbled away at this place, and then the <HI>Golds∣burghs</HI> or <HI>Goldsboroughs,</HI> were invested in the Possession, and remained Masters of this Seat, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then this Name began to moulder away into Decay and Oblivion, and surrendred their Interest here by Sale to <HI>Guldford,</HI> in which Name it found an aboad, untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was conveyed to <HI>John Bois</HI> Esquire, Ancestor to <HI>John Bois</HI> of <HI>Fredvill</HI> Esq; now Lord and Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Swink-field</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Folkstone,</HI> was originally, and as high as any Evidence will leave us any Track or Print to walk by to a Discovery, the Possession of the noble Family of <HI>Crioll,</HI> who held here two little Manors called <HI>Bouington alias Bointon,</HI> and <HI>Northcourt,</HI> which were both given by <HI>Nicholas Keriell</HI> or <HI>Crioll,</HI> in the third year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, to one <HI>John Phineux</HI> Esquire, for that Protection and Shelter, which he by a Magnanimous and vigorous Assistance supplied him with, even to the saving of his Life, at the Battle of <HI>Polcteirs,</HI> and being thus fastned to this Family, the Interest of both these places, continued intermingled with their Inheritance, untill they came, by successive Discent, to be possest by <HI>John Phineux</HI> Esquire, extracted from a Son by a second Wife of Sir <HI>Jo. Phineux</HI> the Judge, who determined in a Daugh∣ter and Heir, matched to Sir <HI>John Smith,</HI> who in her right was invested in the Proprie∣ty of both these places, from whom they are now come down to his Grandchild <HI>Philip Smith</HI> Viscount <HI>Strangford.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Praeceptory here at <HI>Swingfield,</HI> which belonged to the Knights Hospital∣lers, of the Nature, Capacity, and Condition of which I have spoken before at <HI>Little-Peckham,</HI> which upon the Suppression of their Order here in <HI>England,</HI> was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty third of his reign, granted to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher;</HI> who not long after passed it away to <HI>Palmer,</HI> descended from an ancient Family of that Sirname in <HI>Sussex,</HI> so that it is now the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Henry Palmer</HI> of <HI>Wing∣ham</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P>In the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John Monins</HI> held Land here, and paid respective Aid for it, as the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> informs me, at making the Black Prince Knight. I should not have mentioned this Record, but to shew, that this noble and eminent Family, (I am bold to call them so, since the above-mentioned <HI>John Monins,</HI> is styled in the former Record, Esquire) can put in its claim to as high and illustrious Descent, as the most of the Families of this County can justly and primi∣tively entitle themselves to.</P>
<PB N="322" REF="169"/>
<P><HI>Snodland</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Lark-field,</HI> was given to the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Rochester,</HI> by <HI>Egbert</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> in the year 838, and is an Appendage to <HI>Halling,</HI> being setled by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, upon the Suppression of the former Covent, on the Dean and Chapiter of <HI>Rochester.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Courtlodge</HI> by the Church, was, as high as I can by the Guide and Direction of Evidence trace out, the <HI>Palmers,</HI> who, as appears by very ancient Deeds, sealed with a <HI>Cheveron between three Palmers Scrips. William le Palmer,</HI> who was Owner both of this and <HI>Rye-huose</HI> in <HI>Otford,</HI> flourished here in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and stood depicted in the Church-Window, with the above-recited Arms on his Tabard or Surcoat, untill some rude hand defaced the Signature. Another of this Name, lies entombed in <HI>Snodland</HI> Church, whose Epitaph alluding to his Name, is registred by <HI>Weaver,</HI> amongst his printed Monuments, of the Diocesse of <HI>Rochester;</HI> and after this Name was extinguished at this place, the <HI>Leeds's</HI> were the next Family, who by purchase entituled themselves to the Possession of it and I remember amongst some Church-notes of this County, collected by the eminent <HI>Robert Glover</HI> Esquire, there is mention of one <HI>Will. Leeds,</HI> who lyes enter'd in <HI>Snodland</HI> Church, with his Armes <HI>viz, A Fessee between three Eagles,</HI> affixed to his Graves-stone: but it seems the Date, Pourtraicture, and Coat, being insculped in Brasse, were by sacrilegious Handstorn off: for now there is no appearance of them, nor of this Family neither, who not ma∣ny years since, dispossessed themselves of their Interest in this place, and by Sale gave it up to <HI>Whitfield</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>There is a second Seat in <HI>Snodland</HI> called <HI>Holoway-court,</HI> and in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> mention is of one <HI>Henry de Holoway</HI> that held it in elder Times, about the Begin∣ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the third: but upon a serious perusal of the evidences, and Muniments, which did relate to this Mansion, I found it, as high as they reached, that is, to the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to be the Inheritance of the <HI>Tilghmans:</HI> and seve∣ral very old Panes of Glasse are coloured with that Coat of Arms, which the <HI>Tilghmans</HI> are entered with, in the last Visitation of <HI>Kent,</HI> and in this Name was the Possession for many Descents permanent, till some forty years since, or more, it was by Sale conveyed to <HI>Clotworthy,</HI> extracted from the <HI>Clotworthies</HI> of <HI>Devon,</HI> who by Testamentary Donation, transmitted the Interest of it to his Sisters Son Mr. <HI>Thomas Williams.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stone</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> was, when it flourished most, but a Chap∣pel of Ease to <HI>Tenham;</HI> but it is grown up to some Repute, since <HI>Simon de Lang∣ton,</HI> Arch-deacon of the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Brother to <HI>Stephen de Langton,</HI> the Arch-bishop, gave to the Monks of <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the year 1227, <HI>omnes Decimas Majores &amp; Minores, de Copton &amp; Eylwarton, infra Limites Capellae de Stone.</HI> Now this <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Eylwarton</HI> were Mannors, anciently given to the Monks of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by <HI>Edmund</HI> Son of Q. <HI>Edgiva, ad victum corum</HI> for the supply of Diet in the year of our Lord 980.</P>
<P><HI>Wildemersh</HI> in this Village deserves a Remembrance; in that it was part of the Pa∣trimony of the ancient Family of <HI>Donett;</HI> for it was in the enjoyment of <HI>John Donett</HI> at his Death, which was in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. But not long did it fixe there; for <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes Donet</HI> his Successor, dyed without Issue-male, and left only a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Margery,</HI> who being married to <HI>Iohn St. Leger,</HI> this in her right went into the Possession of that Family; from whom the ordi∣nary Revolution of Sale, conveyed it to <HI>Richard Dryland,</HI> from which Name by the like Chanel, the Inheritance slowed into Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> Predecessour to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher</HI> of <HI>Bourne:</HI> and here for ought I yet can collect, is the Fee-simple of it setled.</P>
<P><HI>Stone</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> had formerly a Castle, which acknowledged the <HI>Northwoods</HI> for its founders, as their Arms insculped in the old Stone-work now dismantled did easily demonstrate. In the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Iohn de Northwood,</HI> paid respective Aid at making the Black Prince Knight, for his Mannor and Castle, and although it now lye wrapped up in its own Ruines, yet the Shell or Skeleton of it, within which Sir <HI>Richard Wiltshire</HI> laid the Foundation
<PB N="323" REF="169"/>of that Frabrick now extant represents to the eye some symptoms of its former strength and magnificence. From <HI>Northwood,</HI> it passed away by Sale to <HI>Butivant</HI> corruptly called <HI>Bonivant,</HI> and from this Family a Fatalitie like the former carried it down to <HI>Cholmley:</HI> from him by as quick a Current the Fee simple was transported to <HI>Chapman,</HI> whose Wi∣dow <HI>Elizabeth Chapman,</HI> being re-married to <HI>Jo. Preston,</HI> he in her Right as I find by some Court-rolls was possest of it; but her Son <HI>Thomas Chapman</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth concluded in <HI>Anne</HI> his Sole Heir who by matching with Mr. <HI>William Carew</HI> devolved the right on his Family; from whom, in right of that Alliance it is now descended to his Successor Mr. <HI>Henry Carew.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Littlebroke</HI> in this Parish did first own a Family of that Sirname, as is evident from ancient Dateless Deeds, wherein <HI>Laurence at Broke</HI> is re-presented to have been Possessor of it; but this Family before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, had deserred the Possession, and transplanted it by Sale into <HI>Northword;</HI> and <HI>John Northwood</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, passed it away to <HI>Roger Apylton;</HI> which <HI>Roger</HI> lies buried (as the Date on his Tomb informs us) in <HI>Crayford</HI> Church, in the year 1400. And from him does Sir <HI>Henry Apylton</HI> Knight and Baronet, not onely claim his Descent, but his Interest in this Mannor also.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Cotton</HI> is embraced within the Precincts of <HI>Stone</HI> likewise: It was, as high as any private or publick Record can conduct us on to a Discovery, the Possession of <HI>Killingworth</HI> of <HI>Hackstaple,</HI> at <HI>Sutton at Hone,</HI> and in this Family was the Title by a successive Derivation of several Descents preserved, until the entrance of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was conveyed by <HI>George Killingworth</HI> Esquire, to Sir <HI>Richard Wiltshire;</HI> from which Family not long after, the Propriety of this place was, by a Fate proportionate to this, planted in <HI>Apylton,</HI> Ancestor to Sir <HI>Henry Apylton</HI> Knight and Baronet, now Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Stoke</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> was given to the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Rochester,</HI> by <HI>Eadbert</HI> K. of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the year 762. And upon the suppression being surrendred to the Crown, it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth setled on his newly erected Dean and Cha∣piter of <HI>Rochester.</HI> But here are two places which are of secular Interest. The first is <HI>Malmains,</HI> which yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Family which fell under that Denomination; for I find <HI>John de Malmains</HI> Son of <HI>Henry</HI> died possest of it, in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and in this Family it remained until the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Iden,</HI> a Family of generous Rank in elder Times about <HI>Rolvenden,</HI> and here it lay couched in the Demeasn of this Family until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was passed away to <HI>Jo. Park,</HI> who dying without Issue Male, setled it on <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Sole Heir matched to <HI>John Roper</HI> Esquire; from whom by paternal succession the Inheritance is come down to his Descendant <HI>Christopher Roper</HI> Baron of <HI>Tenham. Tuders</HI> is the second, which anciently confessed a Family of that Appellation to be its original Possessors, whose Name was in all probability primitively <HI>Theodore;</HI> for I have seen an ancient Roll of <HI>Kentish</HI> Arms, wherein <HI>Tuder</HI> of <HI>Stoke</HI> bears the same Coat with <HI>Owen Theodore</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Tuder, viz. Azure a Cheveron between three Helmets Argent:</HI> But to proceed: When this Family dislodged from this place, for want of Intelligence I con∣fess I know not, onely in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth I find it possest by <HI>Woodward,</HI> in which Family the Title remained invested until the entrance of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to <HI>Wilkins,</HI> from whom by a quick Alienation it went away, and resigned up its Interest by Sale to <HI>Bright,</HI> and in the Revenue of his Descendant is the Proprietie of it yet wrapped up.</P>
<P><HI>Stourmouth</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blengate,</HI> was a piece of that large Revenue, which owned the Signory of <HI>Hussey.</HI> In the fifty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Henry le Hussey</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren, to his Mannor of <HI>Stourmouth,</HI> and his Grand∣child <HI>Henry le Hussey</HI> died possest of it in the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but, alass, neither the Nobleness of the Name, nor wideness of the Franchise, could keep this Family from departing from this place; for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find it in the Tenure of the eminent Family of <HI>Apulderfield;</HI> but setled not long here; for Sir <HI>William Apulderfield</HI> about the middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth concluded
<PB N="324" REF="170"/>in <HI>Elizabeth Apulderfield,</HI> who was his Sole Daughter and Heir, who by matching with Sir <HI>Jo. Phineux</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh made it his Demeasn: but the Title of this place did not long fix here; for, he dying without Issue Male, <HI>Jane</HI> his only Daughter, became his only Heir, who by espou∣sing of <HI>Jo. Roper</HI> Esq; of St. <HI>Dunstans</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> linked it to the Demeasn of this Fa∣mily; from whom in a continued Current of descent the Proprietie of it is now flowed down to <HI>William Roper,</HI> a Cadet or younger Branch of this Stem.</P>
<P><HI>Shorne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> was, as high as the Reign of K. <HI>John,</HI> the Patrimony of the Noble Family of <HI>Nevil. Jordanus</HI> and in some old Deeds written <HI>Jollanus de Nevil</HI> held the Mannor of <HI>Shorne</HI> as appears by the Pipe-Roll of that year, and <HI>John de Nevil</HI> was his Son and Heir, who held this Mannor in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, but after him I can track no farther Mention of this Family at this place; for in the fifty fourth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears by the Pipe-roll of that year, I discover <HI>Roger de Norwood</HI> to be Lord of the Fee, this was that <HI>Roger de Norwood,</HI> who disdaining to have his Lands held in that Lazy and sluggish Tenure of Gavelkind, changed it into the more active one of Knights Service in the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, still reserving to himself by that Licence by which he ob∣tained a Grant of the first, to reserve the ancient Rent whereby his Lands held even in the Time of the <HI>Conquerour:</HI> and he in the thirteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, died possest of this Mannor and all its Perquisites at <HI>Oisterland</HI> in <HI>Cliff</HI> and other places, and left it to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>John de Norwood,</HI> who together with his eldest Son Sir <HI>John de Norwood</HI> accompanied that triumphant Prince <HI>Edward</HI> the first in his Victorious Design undertaken against the Scots in the twenty eighth of his Reign. The Mannor of <HI>Shorn</HI> holding by this Tenure, <HI>viz.</HI> to carry a White Banner forty Dayes together at their own Charges, whensoever the King should commence a War in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as appears by an Inquisition taken after the Death of <HI>Roger de Norwood</HI> in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; <HI>Rot.

The Tenure which was annexed to this Investiture was this, to assist the K. of <HI>Poland</HI> with an hundred Horse, whenso∣ever he should personally advance into the Field against an enemie.</P>
<P>But to return: <HI>John de Norwood</HI> was the last of this Name whom I find setled in the Inheritance of <HI>Shorne</HI> and he enjoyed it at his Decease, which was in the second year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Stowting</HI> lies in a Hundred which borrows its Name from this place.

The next Family which was successively entituled to the possession was the noble Family of <HI>Burghurst</HI> or <HI>Burwash,</HI> the first of which, whom by some old Deeds I discover to have held this place, was <HI>Bartholomew de Burwash,</HI> who received the Order of Knighthood by <HI>Edward</HI> the first; for his Noble and generous Assistance given to that Prince at the Seige of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in the twenty eighth of his Reign, and he had Issue <HI>Stephen de Burwash,</HI> who obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Mannors <HI>Stowting, Sifleston, Ditton,</HI> and <HI>Burwash</HI> in <HI>Chiddington,</HI> in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and died possest of this Mannor and Hundred in the third year of that Prince's Government, as appears, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Stockbery</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton</HI> celebrates the Memory of the illustrious Family of <HI>Crioll,</HI> who lived here in Reputation amongst the eminent Gentry of this County, and in the Recital of their Possessions in this Parish, their Mansion was called a Castle, and divers of their old Deeds bore <HI>Teste</HI> at their Castle of <HI>Stockbery.</HI> Sir <HI>Ni∣cholas de Crioll</HI> was the first that brought this Family into Repute and Eminence; for he was one of those who accompanied <HI>Edward</HI> the first in the twenty eighth year of his Reign in his fortunate Attempt upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> when after a pertinacious Siege he reduced the Castle of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> a piece in the repute of those Times, held almost inexpugnable; and for his signal Service in that Expedition, was created Knight Ban∣neret, and died possest of this place in the thirty first of <HI>Edward</HI> the first: and in this Name and Family did the Title of this place by an uninterrupted Current of De∣scent, stream down to Sir <HI>Thomas Crioll</HI> Knight of the Garter, eminent for several Services performed under the Scepter of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, who being infortunately beheaded at the second battle of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> whilst he endeavoured to support the Title of the House of <HI>York</HI> in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth determined in Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which was wedded to <HI>Edward Bourchier</HI> who cast this Mannor into his possession, and he in her Right died seised of it in the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh; but after this it was not long constant to the Interest of this Family; for in the twenty third year of the abovesaid Prince, <HI>Robert Tate</HI> died seised of it, by right of purchase. And in the Descendants of this Name was the Possession involved, by a long Series of years, until those Times which almost fell under our Cognizance, and then this Mannor was conveyed to Sir <HI>Edward Duke</HI> of <HI>Cosington</HI> in <HI>Alre sord;</HI> whose Lady Dowager, in Right of Joynture, hath now the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Gillested</HI> in this Parish, did formerly relate to the noble Family of <HI>Savage,</HI> and was wrapped up in those Lands to which <HI>John de Savage</HI> Grand-child to <HI>Rafe de Savage,</HI> who was with <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Acon,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first: and <HI>Arnold Savage</HI> Son of Sir <HI>Thomas Savage</HI> died possest of it in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left it to his Son Sir <HI>Arnold Savage,</HI> whose Daughter and Heir <HI>Elizabeth Savage</HI> was first matched to <HI>Reginald Cobham,</HI> by whom she had no Issue, and after to <HI>William Clifford</HI> Esquire, second Brother to <HI>Robert Clifford,</HI> who was often Knight of the Shire in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, whose Posterity in Right of this Alliance were possest of this place, until the latter end of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, and then it was altenated to <HI>Knight,</HI> Ancestor to Mr. <HI>William Knight,</HI> upon whose Decease his sole Daughter and Heir Mrs. <HI>Frances Buck,</HI> Widow of Mr. <HI>Peter Buck</HI> of <HI>Rochester</HI> lately deceased, is now entred upon the Possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Cowsted</HI> is another place of Account in <HI>Stockbery:</HI> It was in Times of an elder In∣scription written <HI>Godsted,</HI> as giving Seat, and yielding a Sirname to a Family so called. <HI>William de Codested alias Godsted</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twenty seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and had Issue <HI>William de Codested,</HI> who was likewise in posses∣sion of it at his Death, which was in the Enjoyment of it in the ninteenth year of Issue <HI>Richard de Codested,</HI> who was in the Enjoyment of it in the ninteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Stodmersh</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Downhamford,</HI> was innobled anciently, by being parcel of the Revenue of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings of <HI>Kent,</HI> and rested in their Demeasne until <HI>Lotharius,</HI> one of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Kings, made <HI>Godd</HI> his Heir, and as <HI>Thorne</HI> re∣cords in his Annals, setled it on the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> and remained succes∣sively interwoven with the Patrimony of that Convent, until the publick Suppression, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, rent it away: and then that Prince, in the thirty seventh year of his reign, granted it to <HI>John Masters,</HI> and he upon his Decease set∣led it on his Son Mr. <HI>Thomas Masters,</HI> and he dying without Issue-male, left it to his Daughter and Co-heir <HI>Elizabeth Masters,</HI> who by matching with Mr. <HI>William Courthop</HI> knit the propriety of it to his Inneritance, and he had Issue Mr. <HI>Thomas Courthop,</HI> who, in Right of this Alliance, is now entituled to the instant possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Stroude</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> was granted in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, by the same Prince, <HI>Magistro &amp; Fratribus Militiae Templi Solomonis,</HI> that is, to the Knights Temples, who had here an eminent Mansion, which from its being of their possession, hath ever since acquired the Name of the Mannor of <HI>Tem∣ple.</HI> After the suppression of this rich and magnificent Order, in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, upon what pretences, and colourable Insinuations, I have dis∣covered in my Description of <HI>Temple Ewell,</HI> this Mannor was united to the Crown. And though a principal part of the Lands, which related to this Order in this Coun∣ty, before their Dissolution, was by that Act of Parliament, called, <HI>Statutum de Terris Templariorum,</HI> setled on the Knights Hospilaters; yet this was lodged in the Royal Revenue, until the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then he conferred it by Grant on <HI>Mary</HI> Countess of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who about six years after bestowed it on the Abbess and Sisters Minorites of the profession of St. <HI>Clare,</HI> at the Abby of <HI>Denney</HI> in <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> to which place she had removed them from <HI>Waterbeach,</HI> where they were first planted by her. And here did this Mannor reside, until ano∣ther Tempest, more fatal and ruinous then the former, arose in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, which like a Whirl-winde ravished it away from the Revenue of the Church, and then that Monarch in the thirty second year of his reign, made it the propriety of <HI>Edward Elrington</HI> Esquire. But it seems the Title of Church-Land is stuck so thick with the Curses of the first Donors, that it becomes like a Moath re∣ceived into a Garment, which like an ingrateful Guest, commonly destroyes the House which entertained it, and so it was here; for, in the same year it was granted, the abovesaid Person alienated it to <HI>George Brook</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> whose infortunate Grandchild <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> was enwrapped in that obscure and mysterious De∣sign of Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> which was muffled up in such a complicated Veile of that magical Mist called Reason of State, and other Intrigues of wrested policy, that it remains dark and perplexed, until this Day; indeed the Crimes of this un∣happy Gentleman, were by the mercenary Tongues of some Lawyers, who were in pension to the Interest of those, who then steared the Helm of State, and who like some Trumpeters, knew how to sell their Breath to the best advantage, aggra∣vated and multiplied to that Bulk and Dimension, that he was convicted of high Treason, in the beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> and though he lost not his Life, he did that of his Estate, here at <HI>Stroude,</HI> which was by the abovesaid Prince conferred by Grant on <HI>Robert Cecill</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> principal Secretary of Estate, in Respect he had matched with <HI>Elizabeth Brook,</HI> Sister to this infortunate Lord, from whom it descended to his Son, the Right Honorable <HI>William Cecill,</HI> Captain of the Band

<P>The Chappel of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> in <HI>Stroud,</HI> was by <HI>Gilbert Glanvill</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> with the Consent of the Prior of <HI>Rochestor, William</HI> Arch-deacon of the same See, and likewise of the Parish Priest of <HI>Frendsbury</HI> (within the Precincts of whose Vil∣lage, Church, and Congregation, it was in elder Times circumscribed) erected, and improved into a Mother-church, and that for these two Reasons. First, it was divided by too great Distance from the Church of <HI>Frendsbury:</HI> And secondly, the Inhabitants began to multiply to that Number, that it was probable that in Decur∣sion of Time, the above recited Church would be in no Capacity for the Reception of so great a Conflux: and therefore it was judged convenient by the Authority of that Age, to establish <HI>Stroud</HI> into a Parish, independent to <HI>Frendsbury,</HI> and assign to it not only a Church-yard, for the Sepulture of their Dead, but likewise a Com∣petency of Tiths (<HI>exceptâ solummodo Decimatione Bladi,</HI> that is, I conjecture, the Tithery of Grasse only excepted) for the Support of the Incumbent for the Time being, as the Records of the Church of <HI>Rochester</HI> inform us.</P>

<P><HI>Palstres alias Planars</HI> and <HI>Sepham,</HI> are two ancient Seats, likewise situated within the Confines of <HI>Shoreham,</HI> and had both Owners of that Sirname. <HI>William de Pla∣nar,</HI> as appears by Deeds without Date held the first, and so did <HI>John de Planar,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and died possest of it, in the forty seventh year of that Prince's reign, and in this Family did it continue, until the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Sepham</HI> of <HI>Sepham,</HI> an eminent Family in this Parish, who bore for their Coat-Armour, <HI>Argent three Cinque Foils pierced Sables,</HI> and were descended from <HI>William de Sepham,</HI> who died possest of this place, in the fifteen year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Vielston</HI> now by vulgar Acceptation of the Name, called <HI>Vilson,</HI> is another Seat of eminent Account in <HI>Shoreham.</HI> It primitively gave Seat and Sirname to a Fami∣ly
<PB N="329" REF="172"/>which radically was as deeply planted in Antiquity, as any Family which then flou∣rished on this part of the County, some of the old Evidences, now in the Hands of my Cozen Mr. <HI>Thomas Petley,</HI> reach as high as the Government of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and then <HI>Hamon de Vielston,</HI> demises several parcels of Land to <HI>Sepham</HI> of <HI>Sep∣ham, Timberden</HI> of <HI>Timberden Farm</HI> in this Parish likewise, and several others of obscu∣rer Account, whose names are too tedious to recite, by Deeds not circumscribed with any Date, which argues him to be a Man in that Age illustrious, both for Descent and Demeasn. In Times which approached neerer to ours, <HI>John de Vielston,</HI> who paid respective Aid at making the Black Prince Knight, for his Mannor of <HI>Vielston,</HI> was eminent and was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nine∣teenth, and twentieth years of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and he left Issue <HI>John Vielston,</HI> who deceasing without Issue, <HI>John Ross</HI> his Sisters Son, about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, became his Heir, and he had Issue <HI>John Ross,</HI> who dyed about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, without any Posterity, so that he bequeathed it to his Kins∣man <HI>John Berd;</HI> who in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, sold it to <HI>John Pal∣mer;</HI> from whom it went away by Sale in the eighteenth year of the above-mentioned Prince, to <HI>Richard Page,</HI> where it made its aboad, till the nineteenth year of <HI>H.</HI> the se∣venth; and then <HI>Edmund Page</HI> this Mans Son, cast it by Sale into the Inheritance of <HI>Richard Wood,</HI> who in the fourth yeer of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, alienates the Fee-simple to <HI>Robert Blague,</HI> and he in the sixth yeer of that Prince demises it to <HI>William Petley</HI> of <HI>Halsted,</HI> and he upon his decease bequeaths it to his second Son Mr. <HI>Thomas Petley,</HI> from whom in a direct Line is my Cosin Mr. <HI>Thomas Petley</HI> descended, in whom (by original derivation from him) the Interess and Right of this ancient Seat is at this instant invested.</P>
<P>The Castle of <HI>Shorham,</HI> was, if not built by, yet certainly very anciently in the Possession of the Family of <HI>Aldham,</HI> of <HI>Aldham St. Cleres</HI> in <HI>Kemsing,</HI> one of which Name was Castellan of this place, in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and was Ancestor to Sir <HI>Thomas de Aldham,</HI> who flourished in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in whom the Male-line ended, so that his three Daughters matched to <HI>Francis St. Clere, Martin de Peckham,</HI> and <HI>John de Novoburgo</HI> or <HI>Newborough</HI> of <HI>Newborough</HI> in the County of <HI>Dorset,</HI> became his Coheirs, and this Castle upon the Distinction of his Estate into parcels, was annexed to the Demeasn of <HI>Newbo∣rough;</HI> in which Family, after the Title had as in a constant Chanel flowed untill the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was diverted by Sale into <HI>Polhill,</HI> in which Family and Name, the Propriety hath ever since, untill this instant, been fixed and per∣manent.</P>
<P><HI>Southfleet</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Axstone,</HI> did belong to the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Rochester,</HI> and was given to that Covent by <HI>Hamo de Heath,</HI> in the year of our Lord 1346, which was not long before his Decease, and I find by an old Manuscript which represents to us the Liberties and Franchises which were setled upon this Cloister, that the Prior had by Prescription a Charter of Free-warren, to his Mannor of <HI>Southsleer:</HI> yet though it were fortified with this Priviledge,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hook</HI> in <HI>Southfleet,</HI> hath been for some Centuries of years, the Seat of the <HI>Swans</HI> who in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond, as appears by their own Deeds writ Gen∣men.</NOTE> it could not be secure from that Tempest which arose in the reign of <HI>Heury</HI> the eighth; which like a Whirlwind ravished it a∣way from the Patrimony of the Church, and lodged it in the Revenue of the Crown, where it dwelt untill the thirty seventh year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was by Concession from that Princesse, passed away to <HI>William Peter</HI> of <HI>Writtle</HI> Esquire, who was Son to Sir <HI>William Peter,</HI> Secretary of Estate to King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> and Q. <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and he immediately after alienated it to Alderman <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> whose Successor in our Fathers Remembrance, conveyed it by Sale to Sir <HI>William Sid∣ley</HI> of <HI>Scadbery,</HI> from whom it is now come down by a Chain of Descent to his Grand-child Sir <HI>Charles Sydley</HI> Baronet, the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Pole</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Poole,</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Southfleet,</HI> And was in elder Times the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Berese,</HI> for I find by a fine levyed in the thirty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, that <HI>Richard de Berese,</HI> fells this Mannor under the Notion of a Carucate of Land to <HI>Reginald de Cobham</HI> of <HI>Roundall</HI> in <HI>Shorne;</HI> and from him did it by a continued Thread of Succession, devolve to <HI>John Cobham</HI> Esquire, in whom the Male-line of that Name ended, and he dyed seised of it in the ninth year of

And lett it to <HI>Joan</HI> his Sole Inheritrix, who, by <HI>Reginald Braybrook</HI> her third and last Husband, had Issue <HI>Joan</HI> her only Daughter and Heir, who brought this Mannor and a liberal Revenue besides, to her Husband <HI>Thomas Brook</HI> of the County of <HI>Somerset</HI> Esquire, Grand-father to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, passed it away to Sir <HI>Henry Wiat,</HI> one of the Privy Councel to that Monarch; from whom it descended to his noble but infor∣tunate Grandchild Sir <HI>Tho. Wiat;</HI> who in the second year of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> forfeited this and his Life together; so that from thenceforth, it was clasped up in the Income of the Crown, untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the twenty fifth year of her reign, restored it to his Widow the Lady <HI>Joan Wiatt,</HI> and <HI>George Wiat</HI> Esquire his Son and Heir, father to Sir <HI>Francis Wiat,</HI> who upon his Decease, left it to his Widow Dowager the Lady ..... <HI>Wiatt,</HI> who is now in possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Scadbery</HI> in <HI>Southfleet</HI> hath been for some Centuries of years, the possession of the Family of <HI>Sidleys,</HI> who were in Times of very high Ascent, seated in <HI>Romney Mersh;</HI> for there are some Lands there, which at this Day they call by the Name of <HI>Sidleys,</HI> and <HI>Sidleys Mersh.</HI> In this Mansion there is a Room, whose sides are covered with Wain∣scot, and on one of the Plates or Pains, which appears to be exceeding ancient, the Arms of <HI>Sidley</HI> are carved in embost-work, <HI>viz, A Fesse wavee between three Goats heads erased,</HI> and these Letters underneath, <HI>W.</HI> and <HI>S.</HI> with the year of our Lord affixed in Figures, whose Date commences from 1337. And although the Structure of this House, hath like a Snail shifted its ancient Shell, yet in all its Mutations, and Vicissi∣tudes, which must certainly have very much disordered the Fabrick, when it was cast into a new mould and frame, and ravelled and discomposed the Materials: yet this Panel of Wainscot, hath been, like a Relique, religiously preserved, to justifie not only the Antiquity of this Seat, but of the Family of <HI>Sydley</HI> also, which is presumed to have been resident at this place, before the above-mentioned Calculation: from whom Sir <HI>Charles Sidley</HI> Baronet, claims the Original of his Title to this Mansion, and his Extraction or pedigree likewise, untwisted, into many Descents, and now at last wound up in him.</P>
<P><HI>Shouldon</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Deal,</HI> hath two remarkable places which are situated within the Limits of it. First, <HI>Hull</HI> presents it self to our View, it was formerly un∣der the Signory of the illustrious-Family of <HI>Ratling</HI> or <HI>Retling</HI> in <HI>Nonington. Thomas de Retling</HI> paid respective Aid for this, and divers other Lands of ancient Inhe∣ritance in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at the making the Black Prince Knight, and left it to his Son Sir <HI>Richard de Retling,</HI> whose Widow the Lady <HI>Sarah Retling,</HI> and afterwards Wife of <HI>John de St. Laurence,</HI> died possest of it in the tenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and left it to <HI>John Spicer</HI> who had married <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter and Heir to her first Husband: but he concluding in a Daughter and Heir, by this his first Wife called <HI>Cicely,</HI> who was Heir to her mother <HI>Joan Spicer,</HI> shee by matching with <HI>Iohn Isaack,</HI> knit it to the Propriety of that Family. But before the twenty first of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, he had fixed the Inheritance in <HI>Iohn Bresland,</HI> in whom it was not long resident; for he suddenly after altered his right, and about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, put it over by Sale to <HI>Phineux</HI> of <HI>Swink-field,</HI> whose Successor <HI>Ro∣bert Phineux,</HI> by as quick and early a Vicissitude, placed the possession about the Be∣ginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in <HI>George Monins</HI> Esquire; whose Successor in that Age which was circumscribed within the Pale of our Fathers Remembrance, passed it away to <HI>Crayford</HI> of <HI>Great Mongeham.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Cotmanton</HI> puts in its Claim for some memorial likewise, even in this respect, that it was the Demeasne of the noble Family of <HI>Crioll</HI> or <HI>Keriell,</HI> who were of some considerable Repute in this Track, as appearsby by the Book styled <HI>Testa de Ne∣vill</HI> kept in the Exchequer, where they are represented in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, to have held Land in this Skirt of the County, and in Ages of a modern Aspect, that is, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find <HI>Iohn de Criol,</HI> gave a pecuniary supply at the making the Black Prince Knight: but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, he was departed from the possession of this place, which by Sale was resigned up to <HI>Roger Digge,</HI> and he dyed in the possession of it in the third year of <HI>Ric.</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num</HI> 19. And in this Family it continued, untill the reign of
<PB N="331" REF="173"/><HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was alienated to <HI>Barton,</HI> descended from the ancient Family of <HI>Barton,</HI> of <HI>Barton-hall,</HI> in the County of <HI>Lancaster;</HI> from whom the like Mutation about the latter end of <HI>H.</HI> the eighth carried it off, to the Family of <HI>Brown;</HI> and from them it passed away by Sale into the Possession of <HI>Richardson,</HI> upon whose go∣ing out, the Family of <HI>Smith,</HI> by a Devolution like the former, not many years since, stept into the Inheritance of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sundrich</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Codsheath,</HI> was the Possession (as high as any Light, collected from Antiquity, can waft us to a Discovery) of an Ancient Family called in Latine-Records <HI>de Insula,</HI> and in English <HI>Isley. Iohn de Insula,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <HI>Sundrich,</HI> in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and he had Issue <HI>Iohn Isley,</HI> who married <HI>Joan,</HI> Daughter to Sir <HI>Ralph de Fremingham,</HI> and by her had Issue <HI>Roger Isley</HI> Esquire, who in Right of his mother, be∣came Heir to his Uncle <HI>Iohn Fremingham</HI> Esquire, who deceased without Issue, in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and this <HI>Roger Isley,</HI> had Issue <HI>William Isley</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and he had Issue <HI>John Isley</HI> Esquire, who was Justice of the Peace, and Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and deceased in the year 1484, as appears by an Inscription affixed to his Monument, yet extant (notwithstanding the late general Shipwrack of the Remains of Antiquity) in <HI>Sundrich-church,</HI> and he had Issue <HI>Thomas Isley</HI> Esquire, Father of Sir <HI>Henry Isley,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the thir∣ty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and again in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth: but being unhappily entangled, in the dysastrous Attempt of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiat,</HI> was upon the frustrating of that Designe and the Dissipation, and Discomfiture of those Forces who were to support it; in the second year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> convicted and attainted of high Treason, and executed at <HI>Sevenoke;</HI> upon whose Tragedy this Mannor with all its Appendages escheated to the Crown: but was the same year restored to his Son <HI>William Isley</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> part of the seventh year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> after whose decease, the Title of this place, which had so many Centuries of years like an Inmate dwelt in this Name and Family, ebbed a∣way to another Proprietary; for in our Fathers Memory it was alienated by Sale to <HI>Brooker,</HI> who not many years since, passed it away to Mr. <HI>John Hide,</HI> second Son to Mr. <HI>Bernard Hide,</HI> one of the Commissioners of the Custome-house to his late Majestie.</P>
<P><HI>Brook-place</HI> in <HI>Sundrich,</HI> so called from its contiguous Situation neer some Drill of Water, did acknowledge for many discents, the Signory of <HI>Isley,</HI> the last of whom who dyed possest of it, was <HI>William Isley</HI> Esquire, who held it at his Decease, which was in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 34. After whose <HI>Exit,</HI> it came to <HI>John Isley</HI> Esquire, who not long after, passed it away to <HI>John Alphew,</HI> and he determinig in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with Sir <HI>Ro∣bert Read</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, linked it to his Patrimony: but he likewise went out in four Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Katharine</HI> one of which, was matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Willoughbie,</HI> Lord Chief Justice likewise, of the Common Pleas, and so he in her right was possest of this place; from whom it came down to his Successor, <HI>Thomas Willoughbie</HI> Esquire, who about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> conveyed it by Sale, to Mr. <HI>Hoskins</HI> of <HI>Oxted</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> descended from an ancient Family of that Name in <HI>Hereford-shire,</HI> whose Successor Mr. <HI>Charles Hoskins,</HI> being lately deceased, the Fee-simple rests now in his Son and Heir.</P>
<P><HI>Hethenden</HI> or <HI>Henden</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Sundrich,</HI> which was folded up in the De∣measn of the powerful and illustrious Family of the <HI>Clares,</HI> who were Earls of <HI>Gloucester</HI> and Lords of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> by whose Heir general it devolved to <HI>Audley:</HI> and this Family by the same Fatality, languishing into a Female Inheritrix, she by matching with <HI>Stafford,</HI> cast this Mannor into his Revenue, and in this Name was the Propriety resi∣dent, untill, <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> was infortunately attainted, in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was by escheat, annexed to the Demeasn of the Crown, and made its aboad there, untill King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <HI>John Gresham,</HI> and he dyed possest of it, in the first
<PB N="332" REF="174"/>year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> after whose Decease it remained constant to the Interess of this Family, until the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was alienated to Sir <HI>Thomas Hoskins</HI> of <HI>Oxsted</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> in the Descendants of which Family the Signory and Propriety is at this instant remaining.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Fosse</HI> or Way which extended or stretched out it self from <HI>Oldborough</HI> in <HI>Igtham</HI> to <HI>Baston</HI> in <HI>Heys,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Woodcot</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> did cut thorough this Parish; for not many years since, in digging near <HI>Come-banke,</HI> a Seat so called, which did formerly relate to the <HI>Isleys,</HI> and is situated in <HI>Sundrich,</HI> were discovered many <HI>Roman</HI> Urns of an antick Shape and Figure, from whence we may probably collect thus much, that there was formerly erected some Fortresse, at or near <HI>Combe-banke</HI> (its Situation being fitted for such a Design) by the Roman Generals, to secure their forces in their March to <HI>Noviomagum</HI> or <HI>Woodcot,</HI> against any Impression or Eruption of the <HI>Britons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sturrey</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blengate,</HI> was a Mannor by a Prescription of many Ge∣nerations wrapt up in the Patrimony of <HI>Apulderfeild,</HI> a Family whom we shall have occasion often to mention thoroughout the Body of this Survey, and here it conti∣nued till this Name met with its Tomb in a Daughter and Heir, known by the Name of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who was wedded to Sir <HI>John Phineux:</HI> and although he likewise con∣cluded in a Female Heir, matched to <HI>John Roper</HI> Esquire, who drew along with her a great portion of the Estate, yet this still remained fixt in this Name and Fami∣ly, even till our Fathers Memory; and then <HI>John Phineux</HI> Esquire died, and left this, and other vast possessions to his Daughter and Sole Heir <HI>Elizabeth Phineux,</HI> who brought them over to her Husband Sir <HI>John Smith,</HI> eldest Son of Sir <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> and Grand-father to <HI>Philip Smith</HI> Viscount <HI>Strangford,</HI> who by Right planted in him by so worthy a Predecessor, does entitle himself to the Interess and possession of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mayton</HI> in this Parish, though now of no great Importance, yet formerly gave both Seat and Sirname to a Family that passed under that Appellation, from whom by Sale the Inheritance was transplanted into <HI>Diggs,</HI> where for some Descents, without any Interval it made its abode, till it was by <HI>Leonard Diggs</HI> Grand-father to Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs,</HI> sold to <HI>Goodhugh,</HI> by whose Daughter and Heir it became the Demeasne of <HI>Baggs,</HI> which Name likewise going out here into a Daughter and Heir, she by matching not long since to <HI>Farmer,</HI> has made it to own him for its in∣stant proprietary.</P>
<P><HI>Sutton</HI> by <HI>Walmer</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Cornilo,</HI> and was the Inheritance of a good old Family, called <HI>Stroude.</HI> Peradventure it assumed its Denomination from the Shore not far distant, and was sometimes, in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Denomination, cal∣led <HI>Strond,</HI> and as often <HI>Stroude; John de Stroude</HI> held it, as the Book of <HI>Aide</HI> denotes, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and when this Family was worn out, the next who were invested in the possession, were the <HI>Criols,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Criol</HI> or <HI>Ke∣riel,</HI> held it at his death, which was in the third year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, whose Grand-child Sir <HI>Thomas Keriel</HI> being an active Champion of the Cause and Quarrel of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, against the House of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> was slain in the second Battle of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> where the Title of both Parties was put to the bloody decision of a Field, who leaving only two Daughters and Co-heirs, one matching with <HI>John Fogge</HI> Esquire, incorporated this into his Revenue, from whom by purchase, the Right was setled in <HI>Whitlock,</HI> where it tarried not long, but was by the like devolution trans∣planted into <HI>Maycot,</HI> from which Name the same Fate of Sale carried it into the possession of <HI>Stokes,</HI> who in our memory by the like alienation, transmitted his In∣teress here to <HI>Meryweather.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sutton,</HI> commonly called <HI>East-Sutton,</HI> lies in the Hundted of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> and was formerly the <HI>Braybrookes; Henry de Braybrooke,</HI> one of the Lord Wardens of the Cinque Ports, had Lands here; and in this Track (as the Book of <HI>Aide,</HI> and the Book called <HI>Feoda Militum,</HI> in the Exchequer, do both inform us) his Son was <HI>Gerard Braybrooke,</HI> and his Grand-child was <HI>Reginald Braybrooke,</HI> whose Heir <HI>Joan
<PB N="333" REF="174"/>Braybrooke</HI> married to <HI>Thomas Brooke</HI> of the County of <HI>Somerset:</HI> but whether this <HI>Reginald Braybrooke</HI> gave this Mannor to pious Uses, or not, and principally to the Abby of <HI>Leeds</HI> adjacent, I cannot positively determine, upon the Suppression it was granted (as being parcel of the Demeasne of the Convent of <HI>Leeds</HI>) by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty seventh year of his reign to <HI>John Tufton</HI> Esquire, who pas∣sed it away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Richard Argall,</HI> whose Heir <HI>Elizabeth Argall,</HI> being mar∣ried to <HI>Edward Filmer</HI> Esquire, made it the possession of that Family, and by a com∣municative Right from him, does his Grand-child Sir <HI>Edward Filmer,</HI> Son to Sir <HI>Robert Filmer</HI> lately deceased, now hold the possession and propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sutton Valence,</HI> and <HI>Chart</HI> by <HI>Sutton,</HI> both lie in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne:</HI> the last of which contracted the Appellation, from formerly owning <HI>William de Valence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> to be Lord of the Fee, who certainly instituted that Castle, that now even in its Reliques and Fragments with much of venerable Magnificence overlooks the Plain: And when <HI>Aymer de Valence</HI> his Son concluded in a Female Heir <HI>Isabell,</HI> she was wedded to <HI>Lawrence</HI> Lord <HI>Hastings,</HI> who in relation to her became not only Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> but Lord of <HI>Sutton-Valence</HI> also, and from him did it des∣cend to his Grand-child <HI>John Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Fembroke,</HI> the last Earl there of that Name, who transmitted his Title of that place to <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> and <HI>Richard Talbot,</HI> who flourished here about the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and they had this Man∣nor by Testamentary Donation, in the fourteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second. In the next Age subsequent to this, I find the <HI>Cliffords</HI> of <HI>Bobbing-court,</HI> to be the Pro∣prietaries, and to this Family was the Inheritance in a constant Union fastned, till <HI>Nicholas Clifford</HI> Esquire, deceased without Issue-male, and left only one Daugh∣ter and Heir, called <HI>Mildred,</HI> who was first married to <HI>Harper;</HI> secondly, to <HI>More;</HI> thirdly, to <HI>Warren;</HI> and lastly, to <HI>Blount:</HI> but she had only Issue by <HI>Har∣per</HI> and <HI>More;</HI> for in her Right <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>More</HI> of <HI>Mellifont</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Harper</HI> divided the Possession: but the first desiring to contract his whole Revenue into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the other to make this adjacent to his principal Seat of <HI>Ruspar-hall</HI> in the County of <HI>Derby,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Harper</HI> alienated this to Sir <HI>Ed∣ward Hales</HI> Knight and Baronet, and the Lord <HI>More, Chart</HI> by <HI>Sutton</HI> to the same worthy Person, Grand-father to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Baronet, who not only enjoyes the Title of his Ancestors Dignity, but that of the Possession in these places like∣wise.</P>
<P><HI>Cheyneys-court</HI> in this Parish hath been adopted into that Name, since it for many Descents acknowledged the Jurisdiction and propriety of that Family: and I could unravel a Successive Series of many of that Name (but that it is superfluous) who were Lords of the Fee; it is enough, that Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney</HI> sold it to <HI>Iden,</HI> which Name suddenly after resolving into two Daughters and Co-heirs, one matching with <HI>Brown,</HI> and the other with <HI>Barton,</HI> the last made it parcel of the Patrimony of that Family, and when some years it had been continued in the possession of <HI>Barton,</HI> it was in our Memory by Sale brought over to be the Demeasne of <HI>Wollett,</HI> and it is now (but whether by Purchase, or by the Right of a Female Heir or not, I cannot ascertain my self) the propriety of <HI>Jordan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sutton</HI> at <HI>Hone</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Acstane,</HI> and gives Denomination to the whole <HI>Lath</HI> wherein it is situated. It was long since a Mannor relating to the Re∣venue of the Knights Hospitallers, who had here a Mansion-house, called St. <HI>Johns,</HI> where they often made their Retreat, when they visited their other Demeasne Land, which lay circumscribed within the Verge of this County: but their Estate here was much inforced and improved by the Addition of the Mannor of <HI>Grandison,</HI> which whether it came to them by Purchase or Donation from <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Grandison,</HI> who died the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, is incertain. Upon the Sup∣pression of the <HI>Alberge</HI> of these Knights of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> their Revenue was assumed into the possession of the Crown: and King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, bestowed by Grant on Sir <HI>Maurice Dennis</HI> St. <HI>John's;</HI> and to him does that magnificent and elegant Pile, where now the Countess of <HI>Leicester</HI> makes her Resi∣dence, owe the first Institution of its Shape and Beauty, though it has been since
<PB N="334" REF="175"/>extreamly inlarged by the Additions both of Bulk and Ornament by Sir <HI>Thomas Smith.</HI> But to proceed, St. <HI>Johns</HI> was conveyed from Sir <HI>Maurice Dennis</HI> by his Co∣heir to <HI>Thomas Cranfeild,</HI> whose Grand-child <HI>Vincent Cranfeild,</HI> has lately alienated his Right to Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Merchant.</P>
<P><HI>Haly Sawters</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Sutton</HI> in <HI>Hone:</HI> a place though now obscure in it self, and not re-presented to our Remembrance but by Annals and Record, yet in elder Times it was raised up to a higher degree of Estimate, when it had Proprietaries, whose Nobility and Title added both Value and Lustre unto it. The first of which Register whom I trace in Record to be entituled to the Possession was <HI>Laurence de Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and he died seised of it in the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<P><HI>Grandisons</HI> is the last place remarkable in this Parish: It was the ancient Inheritance of the noble and illustrious Family of <HI>Grandison;</HI> before <HI>Otho de Grandison,</HI> who was Governour of <HI>Jersey</HI> for life by Grant from <HI>Edw.</HI> the first in the fifth year of his Reign, did transplant himself to <HI>Seale,</HI> which he had purchased in the thirteenth year of that Prince. <HI>William de Grandison</HI> this mans Son was likewise Lord of this place, to whom K. <HI>Edward</HI> the second assigned the Value of 44 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> yearly Rent out of his Mannor of <HI>Dartford,</HI> in Exchange for the Mannor of <HI>Iden</HI> and other Lands in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and from this Man did the Signory of this Mannor accrue by Descent to his Grand-child Sir <HI>Thomas Grandison,</HI> who dying without Issue in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc.

After his expiration, this Mannor came over to be the Patrimony of his
<PB N="335" REF="175"/>Sister, <HI>Margaret</HI> Countess of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who was matched to Sir <HI>Richard Poole,</HI> by which marriage this Mannor was annexed to his Demeasn, and he had Issue by her <HI>Henry Poole,</HI> who with his Mother was attainted in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, upon whose fatal Shipwrack, <HI>Grandisons</HI> was in the thirty fifth of that Prince placed by Grant in his Brother <HI>Geffrey Poole,</HI> who not long after passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> by whose Daughter and Co-heir it came to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe,</HI> and he about the tenth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> conveyed it to Mr. <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Hackstaple</HI> is likewise within the Bounds of this Parish: and was, as high as the reach either of private or publick Evidence can bring down any light to our know∣ledge the <HI>Killingworth</HI>'s; and here, for an indivisible succession of Ages, did the Pos∣session fix, and reside, until at last the common Fate of Families, brought this Name here at <HI>Hackstaple</HI> to find its interment or Grave in a Daughter and Heir; for <HI>George Killingworth</HI> had an onely She-Inheritrix whose name was <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and she was matched with <HI>Christopher Eglesfield</HI> Gentleman, so that <HI>Hackstaple</HI> in her right, was intermingled with the Demeash of this Family: and here some years did it by this Conjugall Knot appear fastned, till lately the Possession received an alienation; for <HI>Francis Eglesfield</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Son to <HI>Christopher Eglesfield</HI> some few years since sold it to Mr <HI>Christopher Searle.</HI></P>

<P><HI>TAningnton</HI> is situated in the Hundred of <HI>Bredge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> and in Times of a very ancient Inscription did own the Name and acknowledge the Signory of a Family called <HI>Wallis. Richard de Wallis</HI> held it in the twenty first of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and as it appears by the Pleas of that year had a signal Contest with the Prior of St. <HI>Gregories</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> about his Right to the Presentation of that Church. After <HI>Wallis</HI> was worn out, it fell under the Signory of a Family called <HI>Mesingham,</HI> but it seems was not long resident in their Possession: for about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Nicholas Mesingham</HI> releases to <HI>Thomas Chich</HI> all his Interess and Right in <HI>Tanington,</HI> and other Lands situated in <HI>Heckington</HI> and other places, but here likewise was the Possession as brief and inconstant; for before the Expiration of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find it by purchase from <HI>Chich</HI> and <HI>Wallis,</HI> setled in the Tenure of <HI>Geo. Ballard;</HI> and he died seised of it in the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and in this Family did continue until the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then it was alienated by <HI>Nicholas Ballard</HI> Esquire, to Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> of the Dungeon; from whom the right by Successive Delegation is now transmitted to Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Terstan</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Twyford,</HI> was involved in the Revenue of the Crown; until <HI>Eleanor</HI> Q. of <HI>England</HI> exchanged this and <HI>West-Farleigh</HI> with the Monks of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> for the eminent Port of <HI>Sandwich:</HI> which Exchange <HI>Edward</HI> the first (as appears by the Records of that Cathedral) by his Charter fully strengthened and confirmed. Yet though it was prop'd and supported by that Authority, yet it could not be so fastened and riveted into the Ecclesiastical Patrimony, but that, that storm which arose in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, tore it away: and then that Prince in the thirty fifth year of his rule passed it away to Sir <HI>John Baker;</HI> from whom it is now devolved by successive right to his descendant Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisingherst</HI> Knight and Baronet; and he hath lately passed it away to Mr. <HI>Jasper Cleyton</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Barham Court</HI> in this Parish re-presents to our remembrance, that it was once the Mansion or ancient residence of the noble and illustrious Family of <HI>Barham:</HI> this Name was, in Times of a very reverend Inscription, written <HI>Fitz-Urse. Randal Fitz. Urse</HI> was one of those four who were concerned in the Assassination of that turbulent and ambitious prelate <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who though perad∣venture for his violent invasion made upon the royal prerogative of his Soveraign <HI>Henry</HI> the second, might have deserved the Guerdon of an exemplary Death; yet the manner of taking him off cartied with it so deformed an Aspect in those times which were wholly consecrated and offered up to a superstitious Adoration of his memory, and contracted so black a Character on those who were interessed in his extra-judicial ruine, that <HI>Randal Fitz-Ʋrse</HI> fled into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and there altered his Name to <HI>Mac-Mahon,</HI> which in <HI>Irish</HI> imports as much as the Son of the Bear; upon his recess, <HI>Robert de Barham</HI> his Kinsman entred on his Estate here at <HI>Terstan,</HI> and from him did it de∣scend by paternal Devolution to his great Grand-child <HI>John de Berham,</HI> who was by <HI>Henry</HI> prior of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> created publick Notary of the Diocess of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in the year 1309, an Office of as much Eminence as it was of Trust and Concernment, and which the abovesaid <HI>Henry</HI> received by Commission to invest any with, whom he should discover to be fortified with Abilities, proportionate to so illustrious an em∣ployment from <HI>Bassianus de Alliate Count Palatine</HI> of <HI>Millaine:</HI> and he again was im∣powered and commissionated to grant it to any whom he should judge meet to receive it, by Authority delegated and transmitted to him originally from the Emperour, and it is probable that it was the above mentioned <HI>John de Berham</HI> or his Son who paid an Auxiliarie supply for his Lands at <HI>Terstan</HI> as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: and in that Roll kept in the Exchequer wherein there is mention of all those of this County who paid respective Aid in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> that Monarch's Daughter; there is a Recital of <HI>Nicholas Berham,</HI> who contri∣buted a supply for his Lands at <HI>Terston,</HI> and from him by an un-interrupted Line of succession was the Title of this place conducted down to <HI>Thomas Berham</HI> Esquire, who determined in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Anne Berham,</HI> who by her intermar∣riage with Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler</HI> descended from an ancient Family of that Name in the County of <HI>Bedford</HI> made this Seat which had been so many centuries of years in the Tenure of this Family, alter its Proprietary, and become the Patrimony of another Name; Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler</HI> had Issue Sir <HI>William Boteler</HI> Knight and Baronet, who fell a Sacrifice to the late King's Quarrel, whilst he vigorously asserted his Cause and Interest at <HI>Cropredy Bridge;</HI> but left Issue the instant Proprietary Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler</HI> Baronet, whose Ancestors in <HI>Bedford hire</HI> were descended from <HI>Thomas Pincerna,</HI> who flourished in the reign of King <HI>John,</HI> and did Seal with a Covered Cup, with this In∣scription (as appears by the old Deeds of this Family) encircling the Seal, <HI>Sigillum Thomae Pincernae</HI> and it is possible was chief Butler to the abovesaid Prince; from which eminent Office of his, his Successors assumed the Sirname of <HI>Boteler.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tenham</HI> contributes and affords a Name to that Hundred where it is placed, but is of more Eminence and repute, since it was given to <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> at the Intreaty of <HI>Athelard,</HI> by <HI>Cenulfe</HI> K. of the Mercians by the Estimate of twelve Plough-Lands; for the like Proportion of Land in Ballance to the exchange in <HI>Creges Emeline,</HI> that is, the Isse of <HI>Elmely</HI> by <HI>Crogdepe</HI> that is the water which parts the Royaltie of <HI>Swale</HI> between <HI>Tenham</HI> and <HI>Feversham.</HI> And in the Patrimony of the Church did it lie wrapt up till the suppression of all Frieries, Abbies, and other Religious Convents by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: and then <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> finding that the spreading Demeasn of the Church, was in danger to be torn off by the tallons of Avarice and Rapine, he to mortifie the growing Appetite of Sacrilegious Cormorants, in the first of <HI>December</HI> and in the twenty ninth year of that Prince's Government, exchanged it with the Crown, and thenceforth it was accounted a Limb of the Royal Revenue until King <HI>James</HI> by grant invested Sir <HI>Iohn Roper</HI> in it, and presently after created him Baron <HI>Roper</HI> of <HI>Tenham,</HI> (in Gratitude it seems for that Service he performed, in being the first who openly proclaimed him King in the County of <HI>Kent</HI>) and by successive Deriva∣tion from him does his great Grand-child <HI>Christopher</HI> now Lord <HI>Roper</HI> of <HI>Tenham,</HI>

<P>There is another Seat in this Parish, called <HI>Frogenhall,</HI> which in elder Times had the repute of a Mannor, though since by Disuse, that Character is almost shrunk away from it. That it was a Mansion of the <HI>Frogenhals,</HI> is most evident; for <HI>Richard Frogenhall</HI> was seised of it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Thomas Frogenhall</HI> was his Son and Heir, who resigned up his Interest in it, with <HI>Anne</HI> his Daughter and Heir to <HI>Thomas Quadring:</HI> and not long after by the same Mutation, was the Interest of it by this man, with his Daughter and Heir <HI>Joan Quadring,</HI> given up to <HI>Richard Dryland</HI> Esquire, who likewise not many years after going out in a Daughter and Heir, called <HI>Katharine,</HI> she by being wedded to <HI>Reginald Norton</HI> Esquire, by that Conjugal Union, knit <HI>Frogenhall</HI> to the Interest of that Family, where after it had been some Ages fixt, it was by purchase brought to be the Inheritance of <HI>Greene,</HI> who (upon what Exigent or Occasion I know not) in the Conveyance is called <HI>Greene, alias Norton:</HI> but in this Name it made no permanent Residence; for even in our Memory, from <HI>Greene</HI> by Sale the Title and Right of it was translated into <HI>Clerke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tenham</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to it on the Tuesday, and a Fair to continue yearly three dayes, at the Assumption of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> by <HI>Boniface</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 44. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 37.</P>
<P><HI>Tenterden,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Tenterden,</HI> had its denomination, as some vulgar Phansies conjecture, from the tenderness of the Soile adjacent to it: but indeed it was in elder and more true Orthography, written <HI>Theinwarden,</HI> that is, the <HI>Thanes</HI> or <HI>Theins, Ward,</HI> or <HI>Guard</HI> in the Valley; for it was very probable it was subservient to that Signory or Dominion, which the Governour of <HI>Andredswaldt</HI> (so called by the <HI>Saxons:</HI> but <HI>Anderida</HI> by the <HI>Romans</HI>) did exercise, and pretend to, in this Track of the County. Now if you will question where this Castle of <HI>Anderida</HI> or <HI>Andreds∣waldt</HI> was placed; I answer, it was upon <HI>Reding-hill,</HI> not far removed from this place, a Fortress in those Times of eminent Value and Reputation, though since by the multiplied Onsets of Time upon it, it lies forgotten in its own neglected Ruines; yet though this be languished away both in Fame and Fabrick, <HI>Tenterden</HI> has sundry Seats in it, which may make it eminent enough. First, <HI>Heronden</HI> resigns it self up to an Inquisition, though now it be scattered into severall parcels, yet anciently it was collected, as into one Name, so into one possession likewise; and the ancient Ordinaries in the Heralds Office, do assign a Coat to this Name, something pro∣portionate to it, that is, <HI>an Heron rising upon its wing, and gaping for Breath:</HI> but when Time began to invade this Family, and break it into parcels, one part of this Seat was sold to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> Predecessor to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> who is now the possessor of it: but the other parts of it stayd longer in this Name; for <HI>Heronden</HI> not long since sold some part of it to Mr. <HI>John Austin</HI> lately deceased, and the Re∣mainder was passed by the same conveyance to Mr. <HI>Short.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pitlesden</HI> is the second which requires our Notice, it gave Seat to a Family so called, which remained in possession of it, till <HI>Stephen Pitlesden</HI> died and left a Daugh∣ter and Heir, whose Name was <HI>Julian,</HI> who by marrying with <HI>Edward Guldeford,</HI> made this parcel of the Revenue of that Family, and here without any Interruption was the Inheritance planted, till <HI>Iohn Guldeford</HI> Esquire transferred his Right by Sale, to Sir <HI>Iohn Baker,</HI> one of the Privy Councel to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> whose Grand∣child Sir <HI>Iohn Baker</HI> Knight and Baronet, Father of Sir <HI>Iohn Baker</HI> Baronet now of <HI>Sisingherst</HI> in <HI>Cranbroke,</HI> did some years since alienate the possession of it to Mr. <HI>Jasper Clayton</HI> of <HI>London</HI> Mercer.</P>
<P><HI>Lights Notinden</HI> and <HI>East. Asherinden,</HI> are two other Mannors in <HI>Tenterden,</HI> which belonged partly to a <HI>Chauntry,</HI> founded here by <HI>Iohn Light,</HI> and partly to <HI>Brooke</HI> near <HI>Wye,</HI> and were, upon the suppression of the One, and Dissolution of the Priory of <HI>Christ-church</HI> to which <HI>Brooke</HI> related, granted by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to Sir <HI>Iohn Baker</HI> Atturney General to that Prince, <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and from him are they now devolved by paternal Right to Sir <HI>Iohn Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisingherst</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P>There is a place in this Parish, called <HI>Finchden,</HI> which in our Grand-fathers Me∣mory
<PB N="338" REF="177"/>was purchased by Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> Ancestor of the Family of <HI>Finch;</HI> from which Mr. <HI>Edward Finch,</HI> now of <HI>Tenterden,</HI> is originally descended, which in Times of an elder Character, gave Sirname to a Family called <HI>Finchden:</HI> one of whom called <HI>William</HI> de <HI>Finchden</HI> was Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and sometimes in the old Law-books, which have an Aspect on his reign, is written <HI>Finchden,</HI> and sometimes contractedly <HI>Finch;</HI> and it is probable the Name was originally <HI>Finch,</HI> only <HI>Den</HI> was added to it (which was customary and usual in elder Times) because this Family had their Dwelling in some Habitation, whose Situation was near some Valley.</P>
<P><HI>Tenterden</HI> was governed by a Port-reve or Bayley, as the original Patent in∣forms me, from the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, until the forty third year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was by Patent from that Princesse ordered to be governed by a Major and Jurates, and so it hath ever since continued.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot <HI>Elarinden,</HI> which is the last place of Note in <HI>Tenterden,</HI> and celebrates it self to be parcel of the Mannor of <HI>Frid</HI> or <HI>Frith</HI> in <HI>Bethersden,</HI> and was involved in that Revenue, which did confess the Signory of the Noble Family of <HI>Mayney,</HI> and was found to be in the possession of <HI>John de Mayney,</HI> at his Decease, which was in the fiftieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc.

<P><HI>Tilmanston</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastrie,</HI> has divers Seats within the Verge and Boundaries of it, not only of Reputation and Account, in Respect of their own Antiquity; but likewise in Relation to those Persons who were possest of them. First, there is <HI>North-court</HI> and <HI>Dane-court,</HI> both were anciently under the Domini∣on of one Person, and continue interwoven still, though they have borrowed these several Names in Respect of their opposite Situation. <HI>John de Sandherst</HI> made a Claim of Liberties in <HI>North-court,</HI> the sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Christian</HI> his Daughter and Heir was married to <HI>William Langley</HI> of <HI>Knowlton,</HI> who in her Right possest this Mannor, and by a new Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection had the former Liberties exemplified, the thirty seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Pat.</HI> 37. <HI>pars prima Memb.</HI> 21. and after that the possession of this place had by an even Line of Descent been drawn thorough this Family, it did at last by an Heir General devolve to <HI>Peyton,</HI> and by a Derivative Title from him, does Sir <HI>Thomas Peyton</HI> of <HI>Knowlton</HI> Baronet, hold the instant en∣joyment of it. But <HI>Dane-court</HI> was passed away by <HI>Langley</HI> to <HI>Fenell,</HI> and from him by the like Transition, it came over to <HI>Thomas Cox</HI> Customer of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and he by Sale invested the Interest of it in <HI>Fogge,</HI> Ancestor to my Noble Friend <HI>Richard Fogge</HI> Esquire, now Possessor of <HI>Dane-court,</HI> a Person to whom for that Intelligence he has contributed to me in Relation to the Noble Families of <HI>Crioll</HI> and <HI>Valoignes,</HI> whose Heirs General matched with <HI>Fogge,</HI> and who formerly by those Alliances, annexed a vast Revenue in this County to this Name, I am signally obliged.</P>
<P><HI>South-court</HI> in this Parish was in Times of eldest Inscription, as appears by a Sur∣vey of this Parish, taken in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and which lies now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Anneslow Gardiner</HI> of <HI>Haling</HI> in <HI>Croyden,</HI> Sir <HI>John de Tittesden:</HI> but certainly the possession was not long resident here; for not long af∣ter, I find the Lord <HI>Martin</HI> of <HI>Devon</HI> to be Proprietary of it, from whom in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the Right of it was by Sale conducted down to <HI>John White,</HI> after made Sir <HI>John White,</HI> a Merchant of the <HI>Staple</HI> at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and when this Name deserted the possession of this place, the next who succeeded in the subsequent Se∣ries was <HI>Cox,</HI> from whom by purchase the Right came into <HI>Fogge,</HI> and from that Name, by the Fate of Sale, was it made the Inheritance of <HI>Peyton,</HI> from whom by Communicative Derivation and Descent, it is incorporated into the Demeasne of Sir <HI>Thomas Peyton.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Toniford</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>West-gate,</HI> did afford both Seat and Sirname to a Fa∣mily, which came under that Appellation; and there is mention in the Book of <HI>Aide</HI> of <HI>John Toniford,</HI> who lived here about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: but this Family was worn out, about the latter part of that Prince's Reign, And the next in Order, who was Lord of the Fee, was Sir <HI>Thom is Fogge,</HI> who flouri∣shed here in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and after it had been for sundry Descents fixt in this Name and Family, the Interest which they had here, was by purchase brought over to claim <HI>Vane</HI> for its Possessor, where likewise the Title was as unstable: for not many years are consumed, since it was alienated from their Revenue, and made by Sile the Demeasne of Captain <HI>Collin,</HI> or <HI>Seding∣bourn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tong</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> was anciently called <HI>Thewng</HI> and <HI>Thawng,</HI> which import as much in <HI>Saxon,</HI> as <HI>Thong</HI> in <HI>English;</HI> for the common Opinion derived from a universal Tradition, and that asserted and justified by an uninterrupted Assent of elder Times, is, That <HI>Vortiger</HI> the <HI>British</HI> King, gave <HI>Hengist</HI> and <HI>Horsa,</HI> as a Symbol and Pledge of his Affection, so much Land to erect a Fortress on, as could be environed and circumscribed, by the Hide of a Beast cut into Thongs, which accordingly was performed, and the Castle thus established, in Memory of the original Donation, was in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Dialect styled <HI>Thwangceoster</HI> or <HI>Thong-castle:</HI> and this Story is made more probable and plausible, because <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> affirms that <HI>Aurelius Ambrosius</HI> by many provocations endevoured to engage <HI>Hengist,</HI> and his <HI>Saxons</HI> to a Battle at <HI>Tong</HI> in <HI>Kent:</HI> and that there was a Castle here, the Fragments and Remains of some Fortifications near the Mill, do easily evince; though they lie now gasping in so deplored an heap, that only the Rubbish of its Ruines are dis∣cernable; yet certainly in elder Times it was a Fortress of Importance; for the Moat of the Castle is yet so wide and deep, that it contributes Water enough to drive a Mill. But to proceed; After the Conquest, it constantly acknowledged the powerful and eminent Family of <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> and <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badclesmer</HI> obtained the Grant of a three Dayes Fair at St. <HI>Giles,</HI> to be observed at <HI>Tong,</HI> as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 9. <HI>Edwardi secundi Num.</HI> 57.

<P><HI>VVilderton</HI> in <HI>Throuley</HI> was eminent formerly, for being marshalled under the Revenue of <HI>Giles</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> Father to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer,</HI> who by his opposing of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, at <HI>Leeds Castle,</HI> forseited this and his Life, together, to the offended Justice of that Prince: but when his Sons <HI>Barth.</HI> and <HI>Giles</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmer</HI> were by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, restored to their former Dignity, and likewise to a principal part of his Estate, this was folded up in that Restitution; for when these above-mentioned Brothers deceased without any lawfull Issue, their Sisters were found to be their Coheirs, and <HI>Margery</HI> one of them, being married to <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Rosse,</HI> brought this to a piece of his Revenue; from whom by Sale it went into the possession of <HI>Lewknor</HI> of <HI>Bodshead</HI> in <HI>Challock.</HI> And when this Family was de∣vested of it, the Inheritance was by purchase, setled in <HI>Evering,</HI> descended from the <HI>Everings</HI> of <HI>Everings-court</HI> in <HI>Alkham</HI> by <HI>Dover,</HI> where after it had some years found a continued Residence, the Name and Title dissolved together: for <HI>Edward Evering,</HI> left only <HI>Mary Evering</HI> his Sole Heir, who matching with <HI>John Upton</HI> Gentleman, that Alliance fixed <HI>Wilderton</HI> in the Possession of that Name: and part
<PB N="341" REF="178"/>of it, was in some years subsequent to this Match, sold away to <HI>Arnold Terrey</HI> of this Parish, but the Residue is yet constant to the Interess of Mr. <HI>Ʋpton</HI> of <HI>Feversham,</HI> a person in whom the Scholler and Gentleman, are so evenly mixt, as to a Com∣position of Perfection, that it is yet a Question, which of them is the most pre∣dominant.</P>
<P>There was a religious House in <HI>Throuley,</HI> which was a Cell to St. <HI>Bertins</HI> at St. <HI>Omer</HI> in <HI>Flanders:</HI> but when <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, perceived the ill Consequences of having Frater∣nities, and other religious Cells and Covents in this Nation, which had in a manner their dependances upon other States, contrary peradventure in Interess and Affection to this; he suppressed this, and many other of the like Condition, and out of their Ruines and Revenue, he erected the magnificent Monastery at <HI>Shene,</HI> whose first Foundation entitles it self to his Piety and Munificence.</P>
<P><HI>Thurnham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was the Patrimony of an ancient and Knight∣ly Family of that Sirname, made more eminent by the production of Sir <HI>Robert de Thurnham,</HI> a person of considerable Account in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the first, which Prince he accompanied to the holy War, having before his designing himself to that Quarrel, disposed his Estate to pious Uses, whereof this at <HI>Thurnham</HI> was setled on the Colledge of <HI>Lingfield</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and having thus disroabed himself of his secular Inheritance, he with much Vigor and Alacritie assumed the Crusado or Vow to rescue the Sepulcher of our Saviour out of the possession of Infidels, which reso∣lution he so nobly prosecuted, that he offered up his Life as an Oblation to the Justice of that cause which he had before so generously asserted; After his Decease this re∣mained cloistered up in the patrimony of the Colledge of <HI>Lingfield,</HI> untill the ge∣neral suppression, and then growing parcel of the royal Revenue, it lay there until King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth granted it to Sir <HI>Edward Wotton,</HI> whose Anceftor Sir <HI>Nicholas Wotton</HI> was invested long before in some part of this Mannor, which did acrue to him in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, by <HI>Joan</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>Robert Corbie,</HI> and from this Sir <HI>Edward</HI> above mentioned, was it entirely transmitted to his great Grand-child <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> who having setled it in Marriage on his eldest Daughter <HI>Katherin Wotton</HI> matched to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Stanhop,</HI> she by Sale hath lately given up her right to Mr. ..... <HI>Godden</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Binbery</HI> is an eminent Mannor in this Parish, which, as high as the Testimony of any either publick or private Evidences can instruct me, did own the Signory of <HI>North∣wood. Roger de Northwood</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and so did his Successor <HI>Roger Northwood</HI> in the last year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth. But after this I do not find it long constant to the Interest of this Family; for about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find by some ancient Court-rolls that it was passed away to <HI>Iohn Thwaits;</HI> and he in the eighth year of that Prince, conveyed his right in it to <HI>William Gascoigne,</HI> in which Family the Title continued until the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then it was transplanted by Sale into <HI>Cut,</HI> or <HI>Cuts,</HI> and in this Name the Interest of this place was constantly lodged, until the beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> and then it was demised to Sir <HI>Samuel Lennard</HI> of <HI>West-Wickham,</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Stephen Lennard</HI> is at this instant by paternal Right invested in the possession of it.</P>
<P>There was a Dysastrous Accident happen'd here at <HI>Binbery</HI> and it was this, as the Tragedy is represented to us out of the old Evidences of the Lord <HI>Wotton.</HI> The Lady <HI>Northwood</HI> in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, standing on the precipice or hanger of a Hill to see a Fox digged out which had earthed himself there, the Foundation being loose and Sandy sunk under her, and the hanging Hill shot down so much earth upon her that she was stifled to Death with the unequal pressure, e're they could dis∣engage her from that weight, which crushed her into this early Ruine.</P>
<P>Upon the Brow of the Hill not far removed from this place, are the Ruines of an ancient Fortress called <HI>Godward</HI> Castle, which Mr. <HI>Darell</HI> in his Tract. <HI>De Costellis Cantii</HI> conjectures might borrow its Name from <HI>Godar dus</HI> a <HI>Saxou,</HI> whereas it is more probable it did extract its etymology from the goodness and eminence of its situation, as those Intrenchments at <HI>Stowting</HI> derive their Denomination from their tenable force and fortitude: and certainly this is adequate to reason and its own elevated
<PB N="342" REF="179"/>position it being so setled, that it did not onely secure the way which led from the <HI>Roman</HI> Colony at <HI>Newington</HI> by <HI>Rainham,</HI> but it is possible was a speculatory station much in use amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> to survey the Approaches of enemies, in the Valley below.</P>
<P><HI>Aldington Septuans</HI> in <HI>Thurnhem,</HI> was the Cradle of an ancient Family of that Sirname.

<P>There was a <HI>Castle</HI> anciently in <HI>Thurneham,</HI> which as <HI>Darel</HI> affirms in his Tract <HI>de Castellis Cantii,</HI> had both its Name and Foundation, from <HI>Godardus</HI> a <HI>Saxon,</HI> being called <HI>Godard</HI> Castle, which is so despicable an Heap, that not the least Crums or Frag∣ments continue of the Ruines, which might signifie to us the lest symptome of its former strength and Grandeur.</P>

<P><HI>Gore-Court</HI> in this Parish in Times of elder Derivation was the Seat of a Family whose Sirname was <HI>At-Gore,</HI> and sometimes in ancient Court-rolls written <HI>De la Gore,</HI> called so from their Habitation, which was situated near some publick way; <HI>Gare, Gate,</HI> and <HI>Gore,</HI> importting no more in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Dialect then some common passage.

<P><HI>Tunbridge</HI> gives Name to that we style the <HI>Lowy</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and is a small Ter∣ritory within it self, called in old Latine Records <HI>Districtus Leuca de Tunbridge,</HI> and was formerly subservient to the Dominion of those noble Persons, who were Lords of the Fee. The first of which, was <HI>Richard de Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Brionie</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> to whom it was by <HI>William Rufus</HI> granted upon this emergent Occasion. This <HI>Richard</HI> was an earnest Abettor and supporter likewise of the Designes of this Prince, upon his Brothers Territories in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and so by consequence an active partisan of his, which made the Breast of <HI>Robert Duke</HI> of <HI>Normandy</HI> to boile with such Animosity and passion against Him, that the Flame of his Hatred kindled the Flame of a War which could not be extinguished, but by the Depredation of this Earl's Estate, and the utter subversion of his Castle of <HI>Brionie,</HI> which was left an Heap of Flame and Ruines, which caused <HI>William Rufus</HI> to risent his Calamitous Condition with so much Regret and Commiseration, that he granted him as much Land here at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> as would spread into a League both in the Extent and Longitude of it, and in the Breadth and Latitude of it likewise; and <HI>Gemeticensis</HI> reports that this <HI>Richard</HI> brought over the Rope with which he was to measure it, in the same Ship which transported him and his Retinue. From this <HI>Richard</HI> who founded the Castle, the right of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> was by Descent translated into his Son <HI>Gilbert de Clare</HI> the first Earl of <HI>Hertford</HI> and here did the Signory many years find a residence, till <HI>Isabel</HI> Sister and Coheir of <HI>Gilbert de Clare</HI> by matching with <HI>Hugh Audley,</HI> brought this to be the Inheritance of
<PB N="344" REF="180"/>that illustrious Family, where it had not long remained, but <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Hugh Audley</HI> by marrying with <HI>Ralph Stafford</HI> made it a Branch of their pa∣trimony: nor did it depart from this Family, till the Vanitie of <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> embarked him in that Design, which the Malice of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey</HI> aggravated with those Circumstances of Hatred, by blowing of wild Conjectures into the Ears of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, who was naturally a jealous Prince, and emu∣lous of any new blooming Glory, that he was stained with the black Tincture of Treason, which sunk him into an untimely Sepulcher, and his Estate by forfeiture into the possession of the Crown. <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> being thus convict∣ed, in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, there was a great Controversie started forth, in the thirteenth year of that Prince's reign, as appears by our Law-books, in the Parliament then convened, whether or not there were ground enough in the Crimes objected against him to establish an Attainder upon: and it was carried in the Affirmative that there was; upon which this Castle, with all the Mannor of <HI>Dach∣hurst, alias Hilden-borough,</HI> with all the appendant Services and Quit-rents united to them, did escheat to the Crown, and remained there, until Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> dissevered the Mannor of the Castle from her Interest, and made it by Grant the possession of her Kinsman <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> whose Son <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> about the beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> passed it with his Daughter and Heir to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> who conveyed it to Sir <HI>John Kenedie,</HI> from whom not long after, by the same Conveyance it fell under the divided Signory of <HI>Ferrers, Gosson,</HI> and <HI>Johnson,</HI> and they by a mutual Consent sold their Interest in it to Sir <HI>Peter Vanlore,</HI> by whose three Daughters and Co-heirs, matched to Sir <HI>Henry Zinzin,</HI> Sir <HI>Alex∣ander Sterling,</HI> and <HI>Robert Crooke</HI> Esquire, it is now divided between those three Fa∣milies. Although the Onsets of Time, and the Assaults of Enemies together, hath thrown the Beauty and Strength into such a rude Confusion, that it now lurks in its own Rubbish; yet formerly it was eminent for being the Scene of much Feude and Contention, between the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and the Barons then in Arms against them.</P>
<P>In the year 1088. <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bajeux</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> making a Defection from <HI>William Rufus,</HI> to those Barons who sought to support the Title of his eldest Brother <HI>Robert,</HI> placed one <HI>Gilbert</HI> in this Castle, for the Defence of it, which enforced that King to invest it with a Siege, and compelled the <HI>Castellan</HI> to a Sur∣render, and afterwards having taken <HI>Odo</HI> himself, imprisoned him in this Fortress, from whence he afterwards made a successful Escape.</P>
<P>In the year 1215. <HI>Falcatius de Brent,</HI> during the Military Contests King <HI>John</HI> had with his Nobility, by Force wrung this Castle from the Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and maintained it for some Time with signal Evidences of Magnanimity to the Kings Behoof and Use.</P>
<P>In the year 1231. upon the Decease of <HI>Gilbert,</HI> the then Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> seised the Wardship of his Heir, and entrusted the Custody of this Castle to <HI>Hubert de Burgh</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent.</HI> This occasioned an eager and impetuous Contest between the King, and <HI>Richard</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> the Arch-bishop pretended, be∣cause the Castle held of his See, therefore he, <HI>de Jure,</HI> ought to have the Custody of the Heir in his Wardship. To which the King replyed, that the whole Earl∣dome held of him, and that he might commit the Custody of the Lands to whom∣soever he pleased. This caused the Arch-bishop, boyling with much Heat and Passion, to Appeal for Redress to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he managed this Controversie with that vigorous dexterity, that the Pope issued out a solemn determination on his be∣half: but his Decease in his Journey homewards, superseded the Execution of the Papal Sentence.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned King <HI>Henry,</HI> in the year 1259. granted Licence to <HI>Richard de Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> to wall and embattle his Town of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in these Words in that Charter, <HI>Claudere Muro et Kernellare,</HI> which latter Word being made Latine out of the French <HI>Charneaux,</HI> imports that indented Form of the Top of a Wall, which hath Vent and Crest, commonly called embattelling, very ser∣viceable to the Defendants within, not only to annoy the Enemy, but likewise to shroud and secure himself from the Fury of any outward Assault.</P>
<PB N="345" REF="180"/>
<P>This Mode of Fortification was in elder Time with much Caution prohibited within this Nation, out of a Jealousie that it might foment any inward Sedition, and was therefore, amongst many other Articles, inquirable before the <HI>Escheator de Domibus Kerneliatis.</HI> But the War breaking out not long after this, between the King and <HI>Simon de Montfort,</HI> to whose Interest the Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> was by a So∣lemn Combination closely united, the Grant of the above-mentioned King was made ineffectual, and not the least Symptoms of the intended Wall are at this in∣stant visible.</P>
<P>In the year 1263. the War growing hot between <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Simon de Montfort,</HI> the King sets down before <HI>Tunbridge-castle,</HI> and forces it to snrrender to discretion; and therein found, amongst others, the Countess of <HI>Gloucester.</HI> From whence I collect, that in those Times it was esteemed, if not the only, yet at least a principal Mansion, of those great Lords of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Glou∣cester.</HI></P>
<P>In the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, there was a Summons issued forth by <HI>Hugh de Bigod</HI> Earl of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and Governour of the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> to injoyn <HI>Richard de Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> to appear before him to assoil himself from such Accu∣sations, as should be objected against him, which principally had an Aspect upon the War waged by him and <HI>Simon Montfort</HI> against <HI>Henry</HI> the third. To which he alleadged in his Defence, that he ought not to answer, but before the Kings Justices of <HI>Eyre;</HI> upon which a Commission was issued out, in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, to heare and decide the Controversie, and Sir <HI>Stephen de Penchester,</HI> and <HI>John de Rigate,</HI> were the two Justices appointed by the King for the final determination of it: and they upon a serious winnowing of the whole Matter in Debate, did absolve the said <HI>Richard</HI> from the Crimes with which he had been unjustly bespattered; and the ra∣ther, because as to the principal part of them, they had been before entombed in the pacification of <HI>Killingworth,</HI> made in the fiftieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P>After this, I cannot find by that ancient Manuscript, they style the Chronicle of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> that there was any signal Action commenced at this place, because the Castle with all its perquisites, not long after by the Heir of <HI>Audley,</HI> coming into the possession of <HI>Stafford,</HI> they planted themselves at <HI>Stafford-castle,</HI> their principal residence; and so this Fortress being neglected and deserted, languished away in∣sensibly into decay and ruine: only in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, I find that upon an Inquisition or Survey of the Priviledges of the Earls of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> as they were Lords of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> it was concluded that the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> had no∣thing to do within the <HI>Lowy</HI> or <HI>League:</HI> That the Earl had Return of Writs, Crea∣tion of certain Officers, an especial Sessions in <HI>Eyre;</HI> all which by Intermission are shrunk long since into disuse.</P>
<P>In the year 1264. to allay all emergent Controversie for the future; <HI>Boniface</HI> the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Glocester,</HI> decreed that there should be a Perambulation made concerning their respective Bounds: and it was not long after likewise concluded between the patties abovesaid, that Earl <HI>Richard</HI> should hold his Mannor of <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and other Lands of the Arch-bishop by the Service of four Knights Fees, and to be high Steward, and high Butler, which Office was likewise to be transmitted to his Successors, at the Feast of the Arch-bishops Inthro∣nization, taking for their Service in the Stewardship, seven competent Robes of Scarlet, thirty Gallons of Wine, thirty pound of Wax for his Lights, Livery of Hay and Oats to feed fourscore Horse for two Nights, the Dishes and Salt which should stand before the Arch-bishop in that Feast; and at their departure, the Diet of three Dayes at the Sole Expence of the Arch-bishop, at four of their Mannors, in any of the four Quarters of <HI>Kent,</HI> wheresoever they pleased to fix <HI>ad minuendum sanguinem;</HI> so they repaired thither with fifty Horses only. To his Office of chief Butlership was allotted seven Robes like the former, twenty Gallons of Wine, fifty pound of Wax for furnishing out of Lights, Livery for sixty Horse for two Nights, the Cup wherewith the Arch-bishop should be served, all the empty Hogs∣heads of Beer, and for six Tun of Wine, so many as should be drunk under the Bar also. The Articles of which Composition in Times subsequent to this Compact, were punctually performed between the Successors of either Party.</P>

<P>The Priory of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> was founded by <HI>Richard de Clare,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1191. and stored with Canons Regular, or Canons of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> and dedicated to St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> which upon the Petition of the Founder, was confirmed by Pope <HI>Celestin,</HI> in the same year it was erected.</P>
<P>In the year 1353. an unhappy Fire seised upon it, which almost reduced the whole Structure into Ashes: to ballance which Dysaster, the Church of <HI>Leigh</HI> was appro∣priated to this Covent, that by this additional support, this Cloister thus defaced with Flame might again recover its former, not only Bulk, but Splendor like∣wise.</P>
<P><HI>Somerhill</HI> is now an eminent Seat in this Parish, and was certainly in elder Times allotted, as a Mansion, or place of Residence by the Earls of <HI>Gloucester</HI> to those Gentlemen who were Bailiffs of their great Chase called <HI>South-Frith,</HI> one of whom was <HI>Richard de Philpot</HI> of <HI>Philpots</HI> in <HI>Leigh,</HI> not far distant, who flourished here, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and is written in an old Deed, <HI>Balivus Forestae de Tun∣bridge sub Ricardo Comite de Clare.</HI> After him I find, one <HI>Nicholas Charles</HI> exercised this Office, and flourished in it, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second: and when he went out, divers of the Family of <HI>Colepeper</HI> and <HI>Vane,</HI> who were Lords of much Land here about <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> were successively invested in it, whose Names it would be too tedious and impertinent to enumerate. But to return: That this Seat was anciently destined and devoted to the Uses above recited, is very probable, be∣cause it is situated on the Verge and exterior Margent of the Forrest, and so by its commodious position, had a peculiar Aspect upon those Affairs, wherein this Chase and its Jurisdiction was concerned. In fine, after it had been subservient and mi∣nisterial for many hundred years to the successive Signory of the several Families of <HI>Clare, Audley,</HI> and <HI>Stafford,</HI> it was in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by that infortunate person <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who was crushed into an heap of Ruines, by those dark and black Engins, which Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> that subtle Artificer of Mischief, had raised upon him, was with much other Land forfeited to the Crown, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> about the middle of her reign, by Royal Con∣cession made it the Demeasne of her faithful Servant Sir <HI>Francis Walsingham,</HI> princi∣pal Secretary of Estate, who dying without Issue-male, left it to his Daughter and Heir <HI>Frances,</HI> who was first matched to the Invaluable Sir <HI>Philip Sidney;</HI> secondly, to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Essex;</HI> and thirdly, to <HI>Richard Burgh</HI> Earl of <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> created Earl of St. <HI>Albans, August</HI> the twenty third, in the year 1628. to whose Son <HI>Ʋlike Burgh,</HI> lately Earl of St. <HI>Albans</HI> and <HI>Clanrickard,</HI> she bequeathed this Mannor of <HI>Somerhill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hilden</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and was, as high as I can track any Record, the possession of the Noble Family of <HI>Vane,</HI> who are written in very old Deeds, <HI>A Vane,</HI> and was certainly their ancient Seat; before, by matching with the Heir of <HI>Stidolfe,</HI> they became possessors of <HI>Badsell.

He was the Son of <HI>John A Vane,</HI> who flourished at this place, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: but his Predecessors enjoyed it, as appears by Original Evidences, many years before.

<P><HI>Bardens</HI> and <HI>Hadloe</HI> are two little Mannors in <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> both which had Owners of that Sirname. <HI>John de Barden</HI> held the first, as the Book of <HI>Aide</HI> informs us, and paid respective <HI>Aide</HI> for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: and the dateless Evidences relating to <HI>Hadloe,</HI> do assure us both of the Antiquity and Truth of the second.

<P><HI>WAldershare</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry,</HI> was in elder Times the Seat of an emi∣nent Family called <HI>Malmains. John de Malmains</HI> is recorded in an Ancient Roll of those Gentlentemen which entred <HI>England</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and engaged with him at the Battle of <HI>Battle. John de Malmains,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> in his <HI>Ecclesiastical History</HI> does represent to us was Standard Bearer to the <HI>Norman</HI> Footmen, and was joyned by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour as an Assistant Knight to <HI>Otho</HI> one of the Monks of <HI>Ely. Henry Malmains</HI> is registred in the Bed-roll of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentle∣men who assisted <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Acon.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">See more of this Fa∣mily of <HI>Malmains</HI> in the Ca∣talogue of Sheriffs.</NOTE> John de Malmains</HI> is registred in the Pipe rolls amongst those who were <HI>Recognitores Magnae Assisae</HI> in the reign of K. <HI>John,</HI> a place of that Latitude of Trust and Authority, that those who managed it were frequently selected out of the chiefest Knights and most eminent Gentlemen of the County. Sir <HI>Nicholas de Malmains</HI> was engaged with <HI>Edward</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> in the twenty eighth of his reign, and for his worthy under∣taking there received the Dignity of Knighthood, and from him did <HI>Waldershare</HI> de∣scend to <HI>Nicholas de Malmains,</HI> who died possest of this and much other Land in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Walmer</HI> is a Member of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and so in no Hundred: It was one of those princi∣pal Seats which owned the jurisdiction and signory of the noble and spreading Family of <HI>Crioll,</HI> written frequently likewise <HI>Keriel.</HI> The first, whom I find to be possest of it, was <HI>Matilda de Criol</HI> Widow of <HI>Simon de Crioll,</HI> and she in right of Dower was in possession of it at her Death, which was in the fifty second of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 34. The next of this Name whom the Beams of publick Record represent to me to be possessor of it, was <HI>Nicholas de Crioll,</HI> who enjoyed it at his Death, which was in the thirty first of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 39. In Ages of a nearer Ap∣proach unto us, <HI>Iohn de Crioll</HI> in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third died seised of it, and so did <HI>William Keriell</HI> in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth; <HI>Rot. Esc.

He was Governor of <HI>Gourney</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth under <HI>John Duke</HI> of <HI>Bedford</HI> the Regent; not farre from which Place, he defeated the Earl of <HI>Britaine</HI> and in that discomfiture slew six Hundred, and took two Hundred Prisoners. In the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the Duke of <HI>Bur∣gundy</HI> infested <HI>Crotoy</HI> with a Siege, which being successefully raised by the Lord <HI>Talbot,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Keriell</HI> assaults his Rear with that Courage, that he forced that Duke to a Disorderly Retteat, leaving his Canon and Carriages behind him, as the Reward of his Valour and Fortune. In the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, he was sent over into <HI>France</HI> with fifteen hundred men as a fresh supply to buoy up the sincking Affairs of the <HI>English</HI> in that Nation, with which he recovered many pieces of strength: but overlaid with Multitude in an Encounter at <HI>Formigney</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Clermont</HI> and the Constable of <HI>France,</HI> after he had with unparallel'd Testimonies of personal Cou∣rage endeavoured to preserve the Fortune of the Day, he received a Defeat; the Ene∣my buying his Victory at so dear a rate, that it almost undid the Purchaser. Lastly, his Fate cast him into that Civil Contest, which broke out between the two Houses of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and being satisfied with the Justice of those principles upon which the first had engaged in Arms, became an eager Assertor of its Claim to the Diadem, and having enbarked himself with <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> then the Atlas of that Faction, in defence of it, at the second Battle of St. <HI>Albans</HI> perished in the Ruines of that Field, and by an unstained though a Calamitous Fidelity, became the great Example of Loyalty to the House of <HI>York.</HI> And he dying without Issue-male, one of his Daughters and Co-heirs, by matching with <HI>John Fogge</HI> of <HI>Repton</HI> Esquire, brought this Mannor upon the partition of the Estate between <HI>Fogge</HI> and <HI>Bourchier,</HI> who wedded the other, to be annexed to the Demeasn of that Family, and upon his De∣cease it descended to his Son <HI>Thomas Fogge</HI> Serjeant Porter of <HI>Callis,</HI> who dying with∣out Issue-male, <HI>Anne Fogge</HI> who was one of his two Daughters and Co-heirs,

<P><HI>Waltham</HI> (in the Hundreds of <HI>Bredge, Petham,</HI> and <HI>Stowting</HI>) was anciently a Mem∣ber of that Revenue; which acknowledged the Interess of the Knights Templers, as appears by a Survey taken of this Mannor, in the year of <HI>Grace,</HI> one thousand one hundred and eighty, and registred in the Book styled <HI>de Terris Templariorum,</HI> which is preserved in the Remembrancers Office in the Exchequer: and in that Sur∣vey, there is mention made of <HI>Ivo de Haut,</HI> who held Lands at that Time of <HI>Temple Waltham,</HI> lying at <HI>Petham</HI> not far distant, which justifies the Antiquity of that Name in this Track. Upon the total suppression and extinction of this Order here in <HI>En∣gland,</HI> on pretence of some prodigious Crimes stuck upon it (which whether they were imaginary or real, must be discussed in that Critical Day, when the secrets of all Hearts, and the Bottome of all Secrets shall be opened;) this Mannor of <HI>Waltham,</HI> was in the seventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, by Grant invested in the Knights of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> commonly called the Knights Hospitalers, and here in this Order it rested, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: and then being dissolved, by that impetuous Tempest, which like a <HI>Hurricano,</HI> fell upon this and all other Conventual Orders in this Nation, it was swallowed up in the Revenue of the Crown, and there lay couched, till the latter part of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was, in the forty second year of her swaying the <HI>English</HI> Scepter, granted to <HI>John Manwaring</HI> Esquire, from whom by <HI>Hope Manwaring</HI> his Daughter and Heir, the Interess went to <HI>Humphrey Hamond:</HI> upon whose Decease, she was re-married to Sir <HI>Robert Stapylton,</HI> a Person who hath erected his own everlasting Tomb and Epitaph, in those exquisite Translations of his, of <HI>Pliny's</HI> Panegyrick to <HI>Trajan, Juvenal's</HI> Sa∣tyrs; and lastly, <HI>Strada's</HI> History of the Wars, and other Transactions of the Low Countries, who by purchase from his Son in Law Mr. <HI>Manwaring Hamond,</HI> holds the instant Fee-simple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Eshmerfeild</HI> is another eminent Mannor in <HI>Waltham,</HI> and cals for some Respective Account; because in Ages of a higher pedigree, it confessed it self in the Revenual of the signal Family of <HI>Crioll;</HI> for <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> possest it at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and though he expired in a Daughter and Heir, yet it continued still in the Tenure of a younger House, until <HI>Bennet</HI> Daugh∣ter and Co-heir of Sir <HI>Thomas Crioll,</HI> who was slain at the second Battle of St. <HI>Al∣bans,</HI> brought it to her Husband <HI>John Fogge</HI> Esquire, whose Son <HI>Thomas Fogge,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, alienated his Right and Concernment in it to Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe,</HI> in which Family the Inheritance remained until the lat∣ter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was passed by Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe</HI> this mans Grandchild to <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esquire, whose Grandchild Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Knight and Baronet, conveyed it to Sir <HI>John Ashburnham:</HI> to whose Widow the Lady <HI>Ash∣burnham</HI> it accrued upon his Decease, as having been before by speciall Compact made part of her Dower, so that she at this instant, hath the Use of the emergent profits and income of it.</P>
<P><HI>Whetacre</HI> is another small Mannor, that lies within the Circle of this Parish, not worth the memorial, were it not for a Family which extracted its Sirname from hence; for I find <HI>Nigellus de Whetacre</HI> mentioned in the Book of <HI>Aide,</HI> to have held Lands here, in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: In Times of a lower Date, that is, about the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find the Family of <HI>Hels</HI> or <HI>Hils,</HI> des∣cended from the <HI>Hels</HI> of <HI>Hels-court</HI> in <HI>Woditon</HI> to be planted in the possession: and in this Name was the Interest of it constant, until the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Prude,</HI> whose Successor couveyed it to Alderman <HI>Cockain</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> from whom the same Stream of Vicissitude carried it into <HI>Beacon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Watringbury</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Twiford,</HI> was, in Ages of a very high Gradation, the Patrimony of a Family which enjoyed that Sirname, and held not only the Mannor of <HI>Watringbury</HI> it self: but <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Fowls,</HI> which lie within the Precincts of this Parish likewise; and bore for their Coat-Armous <HI>Argent six Lionceux Rampant Sables:</HI> in assimilation, I believe, of the Lord <HI>Leybourne</HI> his Neighbour, who was a Person of a vast power, and no less Estate in this Track: but before the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, this Family was extinguished and vanished, and then the next Family which
<PB N="353" REF="184"/>stept into the possession of these places, upon the extinction of this, was the No∣ble Family of <HI>Leybourne</HI> of <HI>Leybourne-castle. Thomas de Leybourne</HI> held it at his De∣cease, which was in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and transmitted them to his Successor <HI>Roger de Leybourne,</HI> who died seised of them, in the beginning of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third, and left only one Daughter and Heir, called <HI>Juliana Leybourne,</HI> who in Relation to that vast proportion of Revenue which accrued to her upon his De∣cease, was styled the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Kent,</HI> she was first married to <HI>John de Hastings</HI> a Kinsman of <HI>Lawrence de Hastings</HI> who was Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who dying with∣out any Issue surviving by this Lady, upon his Decease she chose for her second Husband, <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington;</HI> but by him likewise had no Issue as ap∣pears by the Inquisition taken after her Death, which was in forty third year of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P>I had almost forgot to inform the Reader, that in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, <HI>Henry de Leybourne,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <HI>Wa∣tringbury;</HI> amongst which <HI>Chart</HI> in this Parish is particularly recited.</P>
<P><HI>Westbery</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, which had anciently proprietaries of that Sirname; the last of which Name was <HI>Iohn Westbery,</HI> who deceased without Issue, and so transmitted his Right in it by Testament to <HI>Agnes Ellis</HI> his Neece, and she in the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, alienated her Interess in it to <HI>Richard Fishbourne,</HI> in whom it was not long resident; for he in the thirty third year of that Prince, conveyed it by Sale to Sir <HI>Thomas Browne</HI> of <HI>Bechworth-castle</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> Controller of the House, and Privy Councellor to <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; from whom by an even Stream of Descent the Title flowed down to his Successor Sir <HI>Thomas Browne,</HI> who in the twenty fifth year of Queen <HI>Elizazeth,</HI> passed it away to <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esquire, Grand-father to Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Knight and Baronet, in whom the pre∣sent proprietie of this place is resident.</P>
<P><HI>Canons</HI> is the last Mannor in this Parish. It is called so, because it anciently be∣longed to the Prior and Canons of <HI>Leeds;</HI> and, after it had for many Ages rested in the Demeasne of this Convent, it was by the Dissolution, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which like a general Inundation broke in upon the Patrimony of the Church, swept away: but was by Grant from that Prince suddainly after setled on the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Rochester,</HI> and made a Branch of their Revenue.</P>
<P><HI>Watringbury</HI> had the Grant of a weekly Market on the Tuesday, and a three dayes Fair at the Feast of St. <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> both procured to it by <HI>Hugh de Leybourne,</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second.</P>

<P><HI>East-Well</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wye,</HI> was anciently the possession of a Family, which extracted its Sirname from hence, <HI>Matilda de Eastwell</HI> held it at her Decease, which was in the fifty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

But soon after this, this Family was faded away at this place, and then it devolved to be a Limbe of that Revenue, which acknowledged the Jurisdiction and possession of <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> and he held it, in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first: but his Son <HI>John Crioll</HI> dying without Issue, about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it came down to <HI>Richard de Rokesley,</HI> Seneschall and Governour of <HI>Ponthieu</HI> and <HI>Monstreul,</HI> as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 1. <HI>Edwardi secundi,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, who had married <HI>Joan</HI> Sole Daughter, and now Heir of <HI>Bertram de Crioll:</HI> but the same Vicissitude, not long after carried it off from this Name; for he went out likewise in two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of whom called <HI>Agnes,</HI> by matching with <HI>Thomas de Poynings</HI> emtombed the Name in his Family, and the Estate here at <HI>East-well,</HI> and else-where, in his Patrimony: but (as one ingeniously observes) the World it self, is but a great Ball cast down into the Aire to sport the Stars, and all the depopulations of King∣domes, and ruine of Empires, is but their pastime; so I may likewise infer, that great Families, from their tumblings and rollings, are but the mockery and disports of Time, and so it appeared here; for <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Poynings,</HI> Successor to the abovesaid <HI>Thomas,</HI> died the eleventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and left his Estate here to his Sole Daughter and Heir, <HI>Eleanor</HI> matched to <HI>Henry Percy</HI> Earl of <HI>North∣umberland,</HI> in whose right he became Lord <HI>Poynings,</HI> and so <HI>Eastwell</HI> became linked to his Revenue, and dwelt in this Name, and supported the Signory of <HI>Percy,</HI> un∣till the Fate of Sale dissodged it; for in the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> passes it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney, William Walsing∣ham,</HI> and <HI>William Fitz Williams,</HI> and they not long after conveyed it to Sir <HI>Christopher Hales,</HI> Attorney General to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and he died possest of it, in the thirty third year of that Prince, and left it to his Son Sir <HI>James Hales,</HI> who not long after alienated it to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> Chancellour of the Court of Augmen∣tations, who erected almost all that stupendious Fabrick, which now so obliges the Eye to Admiration, and left it to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> who had married <HI>Katharine</HI> his Daughter and Co-heir, a Gentleman who merited a calmer Fate, and a Nobler Tomb; for after many gallant Archievements performed at <HI>Newhaven</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> he suffered Shipwrack in his return to <HI>England,</HI> and left it to his Son Sir <HI>Moile Finch,</HI> who very much inlarged <HI>Eastwell-court,</HI> with both sumptuous elegant and conveni∣ent Additaments, and left it in Dower to his Widow <HI>Elizabeth Finch,</HI> Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>Thomas Heneage</HI> first created Viscountess <HI>Maidstone</HI> by King <HI>James,</HI> and after Countess of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> in the year 1638. by King <HI>Charles:</HI> from whom both the Honour, and <HI>East-well</HI> descended to her Son <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl <HI>Wenchelsey,</HI> and from him to his Son, the Right Honorable <HI>Heneage Finch</HI> now Earl of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> and Vis∣count <HI>Maidston.</HI></P>
<P>Since I am so happily engaged to a Discourse of this eminent Family of <HI>Finch,</HI> I shall discover in Landskip the deep Antiquity of their first Extraction. They were originally descended from <HI>Henry Fitz-Herbert,</HI> Chamberlain to King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, who married the Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>Robert le Corbet,</HI> and had Issue by her a Son named <HI>Herbert,</HI> and he was Father to <HI>Herbert Fitz-Herbert,</HI> who by his first Wife <HI>Lucy</HI> Daughter and Co-heir of <HI>Milo</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and Lord High Consta∣ble of <HI>England,</HI> had Issue a Son named <HI>Peter Fitz-Herbert,</HI> from whom the <HI>Herberts</HI> Earls of <HI>Pembroke</HI> originally issued out, and by his second Wife <HI>Matilda</HI> (after his Deeease, remarried to the Lord <HI>Columbers</HI>) he had Issue <HI>Matthew Fitz-Herbert,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Magnates</HI> or Barons, at the compiling of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and was one of the powerful Partisans of King <HI>John,</HI> at the making the accord between that Prince and his Barons, at <HI>Running-Mead,</HI> between <HI>Windsor</HI> and <HI>Stanes;</HI> his Son likewise called <HI>Matthew Fitz-Herbert,</HI> was the fourth Baron mentioned in the Roll of that Parliament, which was convened at <HI>Tewksbury.</HI> The alteration of this Name into <HI>Finch,</HI> was about the tenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at which Time <HI>Herbert Fitz-Herbert</HI> purchased the Mannor of <HI>Finches</HI> in <HI>Lidde,</HI> of which being entire Lord, as he was not of <HI>Netherfeild,</HI> he assumed his Sirname from that, as many other Fa∣milies
<PB N="355" REF="185"/>fell in that Age, under the same Mutation, and borrowed Sirnames from those places which were wholly under their possession and Signory. In the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, there was a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> issued out, mentioning that <HI>Herbert Fitz-Herbert,</HI> called <HI>Finch,</HI> was a Ward, in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the first, and so could not personally serve with the King in his Wars in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore was released of his Escuage for all his Estate in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> which together with some of the ancient Patrimony, and several Knights Fees at <HI>Nether∣feild</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and elsewhere, are not yet departed from this Noble Family.</P>
<P><HI>Westwell</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calchill,</HI> was confirmed to the Monks of <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for a supply in their Diet, in the year 1241. But it seems they were questioned, <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> they possest this Mannor, and after a Solemn Decision, <HI>per patriam,</HI> it is affirmed and attested in the Confirmation of the abovesaid Prince, that it was enstated upon them by his Predecessors, and continued afterwards un∣questionably parcel of the Demeasne of the Cloister abovesaid, until it was resigned by the Monks of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and so it rested in the Crown, until not many years since, it was granted to Sir <HI>Nic. Tuston</HI> of <HI>Hothfield.</HI> The Parsonage anciently belonged to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> until <HI>Thomas Arundell</HI> the Arch-bishop gave it, in the year 1397. to the Monks of <HI>Christ∣church,</HI> to counterpoise those vast expences which they were to be at in re-erecting the Nave or Body of the Cathedral, (called <HI>Aulam Ecclesiae</HI> by <HI>Eadmerus</HI>) which <HI>Si∣mon de Sudbury</HI> plucked down, and had intended that it should like a Phoenix, have rose more glorious out of its Ashes: but was intercepted in his Design by a suddain Death, being beheaded by <HI>Wat Tiler,</HI> and the confluence of his impious and bar∣barous Complices. This Church thus appropriated, was confirmed to the Monks abovesaid, in the year 1400. by King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and upon the suppression was re-enstated upon the Dean and Chapiter of <HI>Christ-church</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P><HI>Ripley-court</HI> is a Seat of good Antiquity in this Parish, and more eminent, be∣cause it afforded a Sirname to Gentlemen of good Ranke in this Track, of which Number was <HI>Richard de Ripley,</HI> who died seised of this Mannor, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 91. and in an old Deed is called <HI>Miles Ar∣chiepiscopi,</HI> that is, he held this Mannor of the Arch-bishop by Knights Service: but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was vanished, and then the <HI>Brockhuls</HI> and <HI>Idens</HI> succeeded in the possession: the last of which was a Family of great Antiquity, and no lesse Revenue, about <HI>Iden</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> and <HI>Rolvenden</HI> in this County. For in the year 1280. as appears by a Fine levied that year; <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Thomas de Iden,</HI> passes away Lands to <HI>John de More.</HI> And of this Family was <HI>Alexander Iden</HI> Esquire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, who in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, slew <HI>Jack Cade,</HI> who had borrowed the disguised Person of <HI>Mortimer,</HI> excited thereunto, as was the Opinion of those Times, by the Suggestions of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> to fathom the Peo∣ples Affections to that man, in the strength of whose Title he intended in the future to claim the <HI>English</HI> Diadem. But the Attempts of <HI>Cade</HI> being disappointed by the formerly infatuated, but now disenchanted Multitude's deserting of him, who be∣gan to risent his Fraud and Imposture upon their total Dissipation, shrowded him∣self in some of those Grounds which belonged to <HI>Ripley-court,</HI> and lay not far distant from <HI>Hothfeild,</HI> and were then in the Tenure of <HI>VVilliam Iden</HI> Justice of the Peace, and Father of the abovesaid <HI>Alexander:</HI> where being discovered, he was by that Worthy Person, offered up a Sacrifice to the Justice of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. But I have digressed, I now return: After this Seat had for so many Descents been the Re∣sidence of this Family, and the Cradle and Seminary of many Worthy Persons, who had been subservient and ministerial to the Honour and Interess of this County, by their Magnanimity and Prudence; it went away from <HI>Iden</HI> by Sale to <HI>Darell;</HI> and <HI>George Darell,</HI> in the last year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, conveyed it to <HI>Baker,</HI> Ancestor to Mr. ...... <HI>Baker</HI> of <HI>VVindsor,</HI> now proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Diggs-court</HI> is another eminent Seat in this Parish, which was the Mansion of the Noble Family of <HI>Diggs</HI> or <HI>Digge,</HI> who promiscuously writ themselves in elder Times sometimes of <HI>Barham,</HI> and sometimes of <HI>VVestwell,</HI> as appears by many of their an∣cient,
<PB N="356" REF="186"/>Evidences and other Muniments yet extant. In the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, there was one <HI>Adomarus de Digge,</HI> who frequently writ himself of <HI>Westwell:</HI> but whe∣ther it were he that was the Judge, or not, I cannot positively aver. In fine, after this place had for many Ages acknowledged the Signory of this Family, it came down to <HI>John Digge,</HI> in whom the Male-line ended; so that his Female Heir being wed∣ded to <HI>Henry Aucher,</HI> annexed it to the Revenue of that Family, and from him hath the Title by a Thread of many years, been guided down to Mr. ...... <HI>Aucher.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dean-court</HI> may be registered likewise in the Catalogue of the principal Mannors of this Parish. It was in Times of elder prescription the Inheritance of <HI>Hussie,</HI> who likewise was entituled to the possession of <HI>Dean-court</HI> in <HI>Wingham,</HI> now the Mansion of the <HI>Oxendens,</HI> by purchase from this Family. <HI>Henry Hussie,</HI> a man of great pow∣er, as appears by that large Estate he was Lord of, both at <HI>Wingham, Lenham, Bough∣ton, Malherbe,</HI> and elsewhere, died possest of this Mannor, in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Numb.</HI> 36. and from him did it in an even and an un∣divided Current glide along in this Name, until the latter end of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was passed away by Sale to <HI>Milan,</HI> in which Family the proprie∣ty of this place is now resident.</P>
<P><HI>Nash-court</HI> is the next place in <HI>Westwell,</HI> that cals for our Survey; in old Deeds I find a Family that sometimes writ <HI>At Ash,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Nash,</HI> into which the for∣mer Name resolved, who were possessors of it: In Times of a lower Step, that is, in the thirty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the close Roll of that year, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 94. <HI>Alanus de Hanekin</HI> held it: but before the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, this Family had quitted the possession by Sale to <HI>Brockhull</HI> of <HI>Calchill,</HI> and was not long after, that is, about the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, by <HI>Henry Brockhull,</HI> conveyed to <HI>John Darell</HI> Esquire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the ele∣venth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and Brother of Sir <HI>William Darell,</HI> under-Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> and in this Name it was permanent, until the last year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and then it went away by Sale to <HI>Sharpe</HI> of <HI>Nin-house</HI> in great <HI>Chart,</HI> and hath been now for five Descents resident in that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Beamonston,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Beamston,</HI> is partly situated in <HI>West-well,</HI> and partly spread into <HI>East-well:</HI> but the greatest part of the Demeasne is circumscribed within the Bounds of this Parish. And in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aide,</HI> was held by <HI>Thomas at More,</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight. But before the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, this Family was extin∣guished; for at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> that Prince's Daughter, as appears by the Roll of <HI>Blanch</HI> Lands kept in the Exchequer, <HI>John Amias</HI> was possest of it, and paid respective <HI>Aide</HI> for it, as having purchased it of <HI>At-More:</HI> and in this Name did it reside, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>John Moile</HI> Esquire, Father to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> who left this, with much other Land to <HI>Katharine</HI> his Daughter and Co-heir matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> in Right of which Alliance, it is now devolved to be the Inheritance of his great Grand-child <HI>Hencage Finch</HI> the instant Earl of <HI>Winchelsey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perytowne</HI> lies likewise within the Limits of <HI>Westwell,</HI> and is registered in the Ca∣talogue of those Lands that <HI>William de Aldon</HI> died possest of, in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and continued chained to the Inheritance of this Family, until about the twenty seventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, it was passed away with much other other Land to Cardinal <HI>Kempe,</HI> who setled it in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, on his newly erected Colledge of <HI>Wye,</HI> and rested there until the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was resigned into the Hands of that Prince, and he in the thirty eighth year of his reign, granted it to <HI>Thomas Cawarden</HI> or <HI>Carden</HI> Es∣quire, and he not long after conveyed it by Sale to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Sisingherst,</HI> whose Successor Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, hath this present year 1657. alienated it to <HI>Na∣thaniel Powell</HI> of <HI>Ewherst</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Woditon</HI> or <HI>Wolton,</HI> is the last place of any Note in <HI>Westwell:</HI> It was originally par∣cel of the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Wolton</HI> or <HI>Woditon. Ivo de Woditon</HI> held it in the year 1236. and left it to his Son <HI>John de Wolton,</HI> who had Issue <HI>Richard de Wodi∣ton</HI> or <HI>VVolton,</HI> a man of principal Note, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, who held both this Mannor, and <HI>VVoditon</HI> by <HI>Berham,</HI> which he held of the Arch-Bishop
<PB N="357" REF="186"/>of <HI>Canterbury</HI> by Knights Service at making the Black Prince Knight. And in this Man's Successors did the Propriety constantly reside until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then some part of it was conveyed to <HI>John Hampton,</HI> and he about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth passed it away to <HI>Richard Rasel,</HI> who died possest of it, as appears by his Will in the twentieth of that Prince; but there was some part remained unsold, until <HI>William Wolton</HI> dying 1540, ordered it by his Deed to be passed away to Feoffees in Trust to discharge Debts, which accordingly was performed and the Remainder conveyed to <HI>Rasell,</HI> in the Descendants of which Name and Family the entire proprietie is at this instant remaining.</P>
<P><HI>Werehorne</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Ham</HI> and <HI>Blackbourne,</HI> was partly under the Jurisdiction of the Church, and partly under the Signory of temporal and Lay Proprietaries: that Moitie of it which was of secular Interest, belonged to a Family called <HI>Bedford. Rich. de Bedford</HI> obtained a Grant of a Market to it weekly on the <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and a Fair of three days continuance at the Feast of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> as appears <HI>Cart.</HI> 52. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 12, which was renued and confirmed to the abovesaid Person in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; and he in the seventeenth year of that Prince died possest of it, as is manifest, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 20. But after him it was of no long date in the Tenure of this Family; for in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, I find it in the possession of <HI>Hugh de VVindlesore</HI> or <HI>VVindsor;</HI> but was not long chained to their Patrimony neither; for about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it was alienated to <HI>Moraunt</HI> of <HI>Moraunts Court,</HI> but about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, Sir <HI>Thomas Morant</HI> (Son of <HI>VVilliam Moraunt</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the twelfth and thirteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to whom that Prince issued out a Mandate, that but one Bell should be rang in any Steeple towards the Sea-Coast in <HI>Kent</HI>) determined in a Female Heir, who was matched to <HI>James Peckham</HI> of <HI>Yaldham</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the third and twelfth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and was as the private evidences of this Family inform me, originally descended from <HI>Hugh de Peckham,</HI> who was Constable of the Castle of <HI>Rochester</HI> under K. <HI>John</HI> in the first year of his reign; and he in her right became entituled to that Interest <HI>Moraunt</HI> had in this place: and in this Family it remained until those Times which approached near the Confines of our Grand-fathers remembrance, and then it was passed away to <HI>Ellis;</HI> from whence in Opposition to the other Moitie which was of spiritual Concernment it was called <HI>Werehorne Ellis,</HI> and from this Fa∣mily not many years since it was carried off by Sale to <HI>Tufton,</HI> in right of which purchase the right honourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> is now invested in the possession of it.</P>
<P>The other Moietie which belonged to the Church, was given in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1010, by <HI>Elphegus</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> to the Monks of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> and was for the provision of their Garments. And if you will discover how this was rated in the twentieth year of <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conquerour, the Record of <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book will discover: <HI>In Limwarled,</HI> says the Note, <HI>&amp; in Hundred de Hamme habent Monachi Sanctae Trinitatis de vestitu eorum</HI> 1. <HI>Manerium de VVerehorne</HI> 1. <HI>Sulling, &amp; est appretiatum LXs.</HI> This Mannor being by the Monks and Prior of the Convent aforesaid sur∣rendred into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth in the twenty ninth year of his reign, it lay couched in the Demeasn of the Crown, until the seventh year of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then it was by Grant passed away to <HI>Tho. Paget,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Twisden</HI> who in opposition to the other Moity which was of temporal Interess, called this, <HI>Werehorn Twisden:</HI> and they not long after passed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Tufton,</HI> Grand-father to the right ho∣nourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> the instant Possessor of it.</P>
<P><HI>Tinton</HI> in <HI>VVerehorne</HI> was a Mannor which anciently belonged to the Priory of <HI>Horton</HI> near <HI>Hieth;</HI> but upon the suppression all its Demeasn being annexed to the Crown, this was lodged there until the beginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then it was by that Prince conveyed by Grant to Sir <HI>VVilliam Sidley</HI> of the Frierie in <HI>Alresford,</HI> Grand-father to Sir <HI>Charles Sidley</HI> Baronet the present Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Capell</HI> in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to a Family so called, whose Demeasn lay spread into <HI>Ivie-Church, Linton, Boxley, Horsmonden, Capell</HI> by <HI>Brechley, Capell</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Shepey</HI> and this Parish. <HI>John de Capell</HI> flourished here in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who was (as appears by the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Boxley</HI>) an eminent Benefactor to
<PB N="358" REF="187"/>that Covent; and from him descended Sir <HI>VVilliam at Capell,</HI> an eminent Knight of this County, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third and <HI>Richard</HI> the second, who left it to his Son <HI>Richard at Capell:</HI> and he dying without Issue, in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, Sir <HI>John Orlanston</HI> in right of his Wife, who was his Sister and Co-heir entred upon his Inheritance at this place, and left it to his Son <HI>Richard Orlanston</HI> Esq; who deceased without Issue in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth: and so upon the Division of the Estate, <HI>VVilliam Scot</HI> who had espoused <HI>Joan</HI> one of the Sisters and Co-heirs, was planted in the Inheritance of this place; and from whom it is now devolved to be the possession of <HI>Edward Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-Hall</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Ham</HI> is another eminent Mannor in this Parish which gives Name to the whole Hundred, and was, as high as the Ray of any Intelligence will guide us to discover, folded up in the paternal Demeasn of the ancient Family of <HI>Orlanston. VVilliam de Orlanston</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Lands at <HI>Orlanston, VVerehorne,</HI> and other places, in the fifty first of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and being fenced in with this Immunity, it came along by the Steps of Several Descents to <HI>Richard Orlanston</HI> Son of Sir <HI>John Orlanston,</HI> who dying without Issue in the seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, as is manifest, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 16. <HI>Joan</HI> one of his two Sisters matched to <HI>William Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-Hall;</HI> and <HI>Margaret</HI> the second, wedded to <HI>William Parker</HI> of <HI>Parkers</HI> in this Parish, became his two Co-heirs: and upon breaking the Estate by mutual Division into parcels, this in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth was annexed to the Patrimony of <HI>Scot,</HI> and from him did the Thread of successive Descent transmit to Mr. <HI>Edward Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-Hall</HI> Esquire, who still by paternal right enjoys the Inheritance of it.</P>
<P><HI>Parkers</HI> is another Mannor which next summons our remembrance, which afforded a Sirname, as it gave an Habitation to a Family so styled. <HI>Edward Parker</HI> held Lands in <HI>Werehore, Westerham,</HI> and other places at his Decease, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, as appears, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 1.14. and in this Name was the Title and Inheritance constant until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then I find by several Court-rolls one <HI>John Engham</HI> to be fixed by purchase in the possession: and in this Family did it remain uninterrupted until the beginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then it was by Sale conveyed to <HI>Taylor,</HI> who not long after demised it to <HI>Collins;</HI> from whom not long since it came by purchase to <HI>Squire,</HI> and he not many years since passed it away to Dr. ...... <HI>Kingsley</HI> Arch-Deacon of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in whose Descendants the Proprietie of it, is still resident.</P>
<P><HI>Hampton Coclescombe</HI> is the last place considerable in <HI>Werehorne;</HI> which gave Name originally to a Family which here had their Habitation, and likewise were possessors of much Land at <HI>Westwell,</HI> and other places; and having lived here many Descents, the possession of this place at last devolved to <HI>John Hampton,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth passed it away to <HI>John May</HI> of <HI>Bibrook:</HI> whose successor <HI>John May</HI> concluding about the latter end in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Alice</HI> matched to <HI>John Edolph</HI> it came to be the Inheritance of that Family; but did not long con∣fess the Signory of it; for this <HI>John Edolph</HI> deceased without Issue-male, and left it to his sole Daughter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> matched to <HI>William Wilcock,</HI> who expiring likewise in two Female Heirs, <HI>Martha</HI> matched to <HI>Edward Ratcliff</HI> Doctor of Physick, and Physitian to Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and K. <HI>James;</HI> and the second matched to <HI>William Andrews,</HI> they divided this Mannor as parcel of his Inheritance. <HI>William Andrews</HI> in the twenty ninth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> demised his proportion to <HI>Rowland Bridges</HI> and <HI>Robert Philipson.</HI> And <HI>Edward Radcliff</HI> alienated that part of it which accrued to him in the forty third year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>Edward Rolt</HI> and <HI>Andrew Mersh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Westerham</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and was in elder Times the patrimony of a Family called <HI>Camville,</HI> which was of some eminence in this Track. <HI>William de Camville,</HI> and <HI>G. de Camville</HI> entred <HI>England</HI> with <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conquerour. <HI>Thomas de Camville</HI> was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae</HI> in the seventh year of K. <HI>John:</HI> and <HI>Geffrey de Camville</HI> was with <HI>Edward</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and there received the Order of Knighthood, and here this Family concluded: for afterwards I find this Mannor in the Hands of the Abbot of <HI>VVestminster,</HI> who obtained a Market weekly to be held at this place on the <HI>Munday</HI> and a Fair yearly upon the Vigil, the
<PB N="359" REF="187"/>day, and day after the Nativity of our Lady, as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 25. <HI>Edwardi tertii Num.</HI> 32. And here it remained with their revenue, untill the Suppression of that Cloi∣ster in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then being rent away by that Tempest, it was in the thirty second year of that Prince, granted to Sir <HI>Iohn Gresham,</HI> which Con∣cession was again confirmed to the Lady <HI>Beatrix Gresham,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>Thomas Gresham</HI> his Son by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> from whom it is now devolved to <HI>Marmaduke Gresham</HI> Esq; the Heir apparent of the Family.</P>
<P><HI>Broxham</HI> is a place of eminent Account in this Parish. <HI>Iohn de Insula</HI> or <HI>Isley,</HI> was Lord of this Mannor, and obtained a Charter of Free-warren here, in the ele∣venth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second. After the <HI>Isleys</HI> were gon out, the <HI>Ashways</HI> suc∣cessively stept into the possession. <HI>Stephen de Ashway</HI> obtained a Licence to inclose a Park here in the forty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the Characters and Reliques of which are not so generally demolished and disparked by Time, but that they are still obvious to a Curious eye▪ yet this Priviledge could not fix it long in this Family; for about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I find it by Sale cast into the possession of <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who held it at his Decease, which was in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 16. But here likewise the Title was as volatile and transitory; for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> passed it away to <HI>Thomas Squerie,</HI> who was Lord of <HI>Squeries-court</HI> in this Parish, and was des∣cended from <HI>Iohn de Squerie:</HI> whom I find by some old Evidences to have lived at <HI>Westerham,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and it is possible, either erected or very much augmented the Seat called <HI>Squeries-court.</HI> The Arms <HI>viz. a Squirrel brousing on a Hasell-nut,</HI> are depicted in very ancient coloured Glasse in <HI>Westerham-church:</HI> but this <HI>Thomas</HI> above-mentioned, dying in the seventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, without Issue-male, <HI>Margaret</HI> his eldest Daughter matched to Sir <HI>William Cromer,</HI> and <HI>Dorothy</HI> his youngest, wedded to <HI>Richard Mervin</HI> of <HI>Fontels</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> became his two Coheirs: and upon the division of the estate, <HI>Squeries-court</HI> and <HI>Broxham</HI> were annexed to the patrimony of <HI>Cromer,</HI> in which Family they made their aboad until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then <HI>VVilliam Cromer</HI> Esquire, having by some Delinquencie forfeited them to the Crown, that Prince granted them to <HI>Thomas Ca∣warden</HI> or <HI>Carden</HI> Esquire; from which Family about the middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> reign, they went off by Sale to <HI>Beresford,</HI> who almost in our memory sold <HI>Squeries-Court</HI> to Sir <HI>George Stroud,</HI> and he some few years since, alienated it to <HI>Thomas Lambert</HI> Esquire, who hath lately demised it to Mr...... <HI>Leech:</HI> but <HI>Broxham</HI> was conveyed to Mr. <HI>Tho. Petley</HI> of <HI>Ʋilston,</HI> whose Grandchild Mr. ..... <HI>Petley</HI> is the Heir apparent of it.</P>
<P><HI>Well-street</HI> and <HI>Gaysam</HI> in this Parish, did anciently confess the two Families of <HI>At∣well</HI> and <HI>Shelley</HI> for its proprietaries. <HI>William Atwell</HI> held <HI>Wellstreet,</HI> as appears by an ancient Court-roll, in the thirty fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Thomas Shelley</HI> in the forty sixth year of the same Monarch, settles <HI>Gaysam</HI> by Testament on <HI>Thomas</HI> his Son and Heir, who in the eighth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, conveys it to his Son <HI>Thomas Shelley,</HI> whose Descendant about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, demised it to <HI>John Potter;</HI> and his Successor about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, purchased <HI>VVell∣street</HI> of the Heirs of <HI>Cothull,</HI> and is in the List of five of this Family who lye bu∣ried in <HI>Westerham-church,</HI> and this Branch of the Name here, was descended from <HI>Iohn Potter,</HI> who held Lands at <HI>Dertford</HI> the twelfth of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and whose posterity continued Lords of these two places, untill the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> and then ...... <HI>Potter</HI> dying without Issue-male, his only Daughter and Heir brought them to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Iohn Rivers</HI> of <HI>Chafford,</HI> who not many years since, demised his Interest in <HI>Well-street,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> of <HI>Milk-street</HI> in <HI>London</HI> Scrivener.</P>
<P><HI>Valons</HI> in this Parish was formerly the Mansion of a Family called in old datelesse Deeds <HI>de Valoniis,</HI> and in English <HI>Valons:</HI> but the greatest Honor which accrued to it, was, that <HI>Islip</HI> Abbot of <HI>VVestminster,</HI> bought it in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh of <HI>Casinghurst,</HI> a Family which had been possest of it many Descents before, and gave it to his Servant <HI>VVilliam Middleton,</HI> who much improved it with Building. And in his Family it was resident untill the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to <HI>James Verseline</HI> descended out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> who gave it with his Daugh∣ter <HI>Anne Verseline,</HI> to <HI>Peter Manning,</HI> from which Family not many years since it
<PB N="360" REF="188"/>passed away to Mr. <HI>Randall Manning</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> whose Son and Heir Mr. <HI>Thomas Manning</HI> is now in the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P><HI>Werd</HI> or <HI>Werth</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eastry</HI> is a Parish if you consider it in its precincts, but narrow; if in position, low and unhealthful, or, if again in its number of Com∣municants, not considerable; but yet there are two places within the Ambuts and Boundaries of it which claim some consideration. The first is the Mannor of <HI>San∣downe,</HI> which was anciently the <HI>Perots,</HI> who held this Mannor as the private Deeds of this Name and Family inform me, as high as the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. <HI>Thomas de Perot</HI> died possest of it in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 31. and then it was found fenced in, and fortified with these priviledges; It had <HI>Infangthef</HI> and <HI>Outfangthef, Toll</HI> and <HI>Theam, Sac</HI> and <HI>Soc, Tumbrell</HI> and <HI>Pillory</HI> and other Franchises of the like Complexion; but after this, the Tenure was but of a brief Duration in this Name; for the Female Heir of <HI>Perot</HI> brought this Mannor with much other Land to <HI>Langley</HI> of the County of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth there was a match between this Family and <HI>Peyton</HI> of the County of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> which match at length brought this Mannor to descend to this Family. For <HI>Edward Langley</HI> of <HI>Knolton</HI> Esquire, deceasing about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth with∣out Issue; Sir <HI>Robert Peyton</HI> of <HI>Peyton</HI> Hall entred upon this and other Lands as his Heir at Law; and he assigned it to his second Son <HI>John Peyton</HI> Esquire, from whom it is now descended to Sir <HI>Thomas Peyton</HI> Baronet, the instant proprietary of it.</P>
<P>Before I leave this Discourse of <HI>Sandowne,</HI> I must inform the Reader that the Fa∣mily of <HI>Peyton</HI> above mentioned and that of <HI>Ufford</HI> were primitively one, and bore the same paternal Coat, were known by the same Name, and were both deduced from the same Root and Original,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ex Auto∣graph's pe∣nes Dom.</HI> Tho. Pey∣ton <HI>Baro∣nettum.</HI></NOTE> onely <HI>Peyton</HI> was the elder House. Now the ground on which the Mutation of the Name was established, was briefly this; <HI>John de Peyton</HI> flourished in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, and left four Sons; whereof the three eldest were named <HI>John, Robert,</HI> and <HI>John:</HI> to <HI>John</HI> the eldest, he gave his Mannor of <HI>Peyton</HI> lying extended into <HI>Stoke Neyland, Boxford,</HI> and <HI>Ramsholt</HI> Parishes in <HI>Suffolk:</HI> to <HI>Robert</HI> his second Son he gave his Mannor of <HI>Ufford</HI> lying in <HI>Suffolk</HI> likewise, who altered his Name from <HI>Peyton,</HI> and assumed that of <HI>Ufford,</HI> a Name borrowed from that Signory of which he was become newly possessor, and from him the Name of <HI>Ufford</HI> was communi∣cated to the Earls of <HI>Suffolk</HI> and other persons of eminent Repure in those Generations wherein they flourished. <HI>John de Peyton</HI> the third Brother, by Deed without Date demises all his Interest in <HI>Boxford</HI> to his elder Brother <HI>John de Peyton</HI> (by that Name he there calls him:) which justifies nor only the Antiquity but the Seniority of this Family of <HI>Peyton</HI> before that of <HI>Ufford.</HI> And from <HI>John de Peyton</HI> the elder above mentioned are the <HI>Peytons</HI> of <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> and Sir <HI>Tho. Peyton</HI> of <HI>Knolton</HI> Baronet ori∣ginally descended.</P>
<P><HI>Lidde</HI> in ancient Records written <HI>Hlyden</HI> is a second Mannor in <HI>Werd</HI> of considera∣ble Account, ever since it was given at the Request of <HI>Janibert</HI> the Arch-Bishop by K. <HI>Offa</HI> in the year 874 to the Monks of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> (as the Records of that Church discover to me) under the Notion of three Sullings or Ploughlands. And the Instrument which confirmed this Donation, was signed with the Marks that is Crosses of <HI>Offa</HI> the King, <HI>Janibert</HI> the Arch-Bishop, <HI>Kenedrith</HI> the Queen, three other Bishops, five other Abbots, Duke <HI>Edbald,</HI> and eleven other principal Persons or Noblemen. And that this was the manner of Signature in elder Times, that is, the affixing of Crosses to all publick Instruments and other original Donations, is most certain; For Sealing came into <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, who being bred up in <HI>Normandy,</HI> in which Province, and in <HI>France</HI> the Use of affixing Seals to Deeds had been in Use long before his Time, introduced that Custome and way of Signa∣ture into this Nation, as being more conspicuous and distinguishable than that of Crosses, or those other wayes of confirming of Grants of Land, either to the Church or to secular Uses, which was either <HI>per Collocationem Gladii seu Cultelli supra Altare,</HI> by the placing or laying a Sword or Knife upon the Altar, whereby those which did make Donations of Land did tacitly insinuate that their Honour was involved in their Conscience, or else <HI>per Traditionem Surculi vel stipitis,</HI> which Custome is yet observed in our Copy-hold Land, where Surrenders are made by delivery of a Turfe, Twig, or
<PB N="361" REF="188"/>white Wand. But sealing with Coats of Arms, was not brought in, untill the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, but were borne by persons of Honor on their Tabards or Sur∣coats: two Examples of which I have seen, one of <HI>William Warren</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, sealed with the Figure of a <HI>Chivaler on Horseback;</HI> his Caparisons, Tabard, and Shield, being all <HI>Checquee,</HI> the paternal Coat of this Family; the other was of <HI>Richard Curzon</HI> of <HI>Croxall</HI> in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> who in the reign of King <HI>John,</HI> stands in a Window pourtrayed in his Surcoat, surmounted with a <HI>Bend,</HI> charged with a <HI>Martlet.</HI> And this was done in Imitation of the Heralds, who wore the Arms of those Princes they serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on their Tabards, as Bad∣ges to distinguish them from the Heralds of other Princes, either in the Time of War or Peace. Indeed Seals in higher Ages, were of that sacred Estimate, that be∣ing lost, they were decryed by the owners, least they might be affixed to any surrep∣titious Instrument, which might prejudice either their Fame or Estate. And in the interval of their Absence or Losse, the Owners abovesaid were accustomed to Seal with the Seal of the Bishop of the Diocess, or else with that of the next adjacent Abbot, all Deeds and Instruments, either of Publick or private Interess. But to re∣turn: this Donation of <HI>Offa's,</HI> though thus secured and strengthned, could not shel∣ter this Mannor, from the Rage of ahat Tempest, which, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, like a Whirlwind caught it up in the Patrimony of the Church, and drop'd it into the Revenue of the Crown, where it lay untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the Beginning of her Raign, passed it away by Grant to <HI>William Lovelace</HI> Esquire, Ser∣jeant at Law, whose Son Sir <HI>William Lovelace,</HI> not long after, demised it by Sale to Sir <HI>John Smith,</HI> Grand-father to <HI>Philip</HI> Viscount <HI>Strangford,</HI> who now enjoys it.</P>
<P><HI>Wickham Brews</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Downhamford,</HI> distinguished from other places of that Name, by the Addition of the Sirname of <HI>Brews,</HI> which Family were Lords thereof. In the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, <HI>Odo</HI> Bishop of <HI>Baion</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> held this place of the Gift of his half Brother which was that Prince; and <HI>Trendle Park</HI> adjoyning there, was a Composition between the Arch-bishop and this Man, for certain Land of the said Arch-bishop, to be inclosed and included within the said Park at <HI>Trendley:</HI> which signifies thus much unto us, that <HI>Woodstock</HI> which boasts it self, to be the first inclosed Park of <HI>England,</HI> was not so ancient as this at <HI>Trendley.</HI> In Times of a more modern Character, that is, in those which commence from the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, it acknowledged the <HI>Brewses</HI> Barons of <HI>Brember</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> to be its proprietaries, who engrafted their own Name upon it, which hath sprouted out, and flourished upon it untill this Day. <HI>William de Brewosa</HI> or <HI>de brewe</HI> held it, and was several times summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and dyed in the ninth year of the last Prince, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 204. After this Family had deserted the possession, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it became the Inheritance of many of the most eminent Nobility of this Kingdome. I shall represent them out of some ancient Court-rolls in a Compendious Series. <HI>Edmund Plantagenet</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> held it in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>William Longspey</HI> had it in the the twentieth year of the abovesaid Prince, and paid an auxiliary supply for it at making the Black Prince Knight. <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> dyed seised of it in the twenty sixth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third. <HI>Thomas Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> his Wife, Sister and Coheir of the abovementioned Earl, were possest of it in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>Lucie</HI> Wife of <HI>Edmund Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> was seised of it in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. After whom it devolved to <HI>Edmund Mortimer</HI> Earl of <HI>March,</HI> and he held it in the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. <HI>Joan</HI> the Wife of Sir <HI>Iohn Grey</HI> one of the Sisters and Coheirs of the abovesaid <HI>Edmund,</HI> was invested in the possession in the fourth year of the abovesaid Prince. Not long after this, it came to own the Signory of the <HI>Tiptofts,</HI> and continued fastned to their patrimony, until the renth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth. When <HI>Iohn Tiptoft</HI> Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> being empeached of close Confederacy and Combination with the abovesaid Prince, then forced into Exile, was by the Parliament then principally moulded out of the Lancastrian Faction, attainted and beheaded, and his estate here confiscated to the Crown, and there was lodged un∣til
<PB N="362" REF="189"/>the first year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was granted to <HI>Anthony Brown</HI> Vis∣count <HI>Montague,</HI> who in the year 1592 deceased, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>An∣thony Brown</HI> Viscount <HI>Montague,</HI> and he setled it upon his second Son Mr. <HI>Stanislaus Brown,</HI> who now is in the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P><HI>East-wickham</HI> is situated in the Hundred of <HI>Little</HI> and <HI>Lesnes,</HI> and celebrates the me∣mory of the noble Family of <HI>Montchensey,</HI> and was wrapped up in their Demeasn. <HI>William de Montchensey,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the fifty second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it to his Sole Daughter and Heir <HI>Dionis,</HI> matched to <HI>Hugh de Vere,</HI> but he dying without Issue in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, as ap∣pears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 51. the Title and possession diverted to <HI>VVilliam de Valentia</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> half Brother by the Mothers side to <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who had mat∣ched with <HI>Joan</HI> Sister and Heir to <HI>VVilliam de Montchensey</HI> before named; from whom it descended to his Son <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> who dying without Issue, <HI>Isabell</HI> one of his Sisters and Coheirs who was affianced to <HI>Laurence de Hastings,</HI> summoned to sit in Parliament by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> upon the approportioning the estate, entituled her Husband to this Mannor; and from him was the Title carried down, to his Grandchild <HI>Iohn de Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who was in possession of it at his Decease, which was in the thirteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 30. And <HI>Reginald Grey</HI> was found to be his Heir, in which Family it remai∣ned, until the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; and then it was passed away to <HI>VVilliam</HI> Lord <HI>Lovell</HI> who was often summoned to sit as Baron in Parliament, in that Prince's reign: and from him it came down to his Grandchild <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Lovell,</HI> summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; and he about the Beginning of his reign, passed it away to <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> afterwards created Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who being a close and eager Complice of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, sunk in his Ruines, in the Battle commenced at <HI>Bosworth;</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Richmond,</HI> having by that successeful Combat ascertained himself to the <HI>English</HI> Scepter, seised upon this Mannor by Escheat, in the first year of his Reign, as relating to a person who had actually appeared in Arms against him: and being thus united to the Crown, it lay cou∣ched in its Revenue, untill the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth; and then it was gran∣ted to Sir <HI>Martin Bowes;</HI> who not long after passed it away to Alderman <HI>Oliff</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> who left it to <HI>Joan</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, matched to <HI>John Leigh</HI> Son and Heir of <HI>Nicholas Leigh</HI> of <HI>Addington</HI> in <HI>Surrey</HI> Esquire, Father to Sir <HI>Oliff Leigh,</HI> who much enhaunsed the Magnisicence of the ancient Fabrick, with increase of Building, and left it to his Son Sir <HI>Francis Leigh,</HI> whose Widow the Lady <HI>Christian Leigh,</HI> in Right of Dower, is now in Possession of the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>VVest-Wickham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Rokesley,</HI> is much enobled by being anciently en∣tituled to the possession of the eminent Family of <HI>Huntingfield. Peter de Hun∣tingfield,</HI> held it, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth years of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and is registred in the Scroles of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who accompanied <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in his Victorious Expedition into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, when he reduced <HI>Carlaverock</HI> by a successeful Seige, for which his merit was repayed with the Honour of Knighthood, his Son and Heir was <HI>Walter de Huntingfield,</HI> who in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>West-Wickham,</HI> a Market weekly on the Monday, and a Fair yearly on the Vigil and day of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 11. <HI>Edwardi secundi, Num.</HI> 23. And left it invested with these Priviledges to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>John de Huntingfield,</HI> who paid Aid for three Knights Fees, which he held in this County, at making the Black Prince Knight, and was a Man of that Emi∣nence, that he was summoned to sit as Baron in Parliament, the thirty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and several other Times, during the Raign of the above-named Prince. <HI>William de Huntingfield</HI> this mans Son, was summoned likewise many Times to sit as Baron in Parliament about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but dyed with∣out Issue, so that <HI>Joan</HI> and <HI>Alize Huntingfield</HI> his Cozens, matched to <HI>Copledike</HI> and <HI>Nor∣wich,</HI> were his Heirs: and by an old Deed, I find that one <HI>John Copledike</HI> held this Man∣nor by Right of Partition, the last year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second; but it was not long af∣ter
<PB N="363" REF="189"/>this fixed in the Patrimony of this Family; for in the seventeenth year of <HI>Flenry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Thomas Squerrie</HI> died possest of it, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>John Squerrie,</HI> who dying without Issue in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth. <HI>Dorothy</HI> one of his two Sisters and Coheirs entituled her Husband <HI>Richard Mervin</HI> upon the Division of the Estate to the proprietie of this Mannor; and he not long after passed it away to <HI>Richard Scrope,</HI> who in the seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth alienated it by Fine to <HI>Ambrose Creseacre,</HI> who not long after transmitted it by Sale to <HI>Henry Heyden</HI> Esquire, to whom the principal part of the ancient. Pile now visible, ows its Erection, and from him did it devolved to that eminent Scholler and Souldier Justice of the Peace, and Captain of the trained Bands of this County in the Reign or Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Sir <HI>Christopher Heydon,</HI> who about the latter end of that Princess passed it away to Sir <HI>Samuel Lennard,</HI> Father to Sir <HI>Stephen Lennard,</HI> who is entituled to the present propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Wymingswould</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Wingham,</HI> contains within the Circuit or Limits of it an ancient Seat called <HI>Nethersole,</HI> from its situation near some Pool or descending Pond; and was as high as the Time of K. <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the possession of a Family which was represented to the world under this Sirname; for as it appears by the Original Deeds and Evidences which fortifie the Title of this Mansion, <HI>Richard de Nethersoll</HI> flourished here about the Government of the abovesaid Monarchs, and from him was it by a perpetuated Succession chained together by an uninterrupted Link of Descent brought down to the days of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then I find by a Roll of the <HI>Nethersolls</HI> in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Nethersoll</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> not long since deceased, that it was the Inheritance of one <HI>John Nethersoll</HI> Esquire, one that re∣tained to the Court of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and a person whom that Prince did by e∣special Indulgence license even in his presence for some distemper in his Head occa∣sioned by some accidental Circumstances, <HI>indutum esse Pileo,</HI> to be covered with a Cap, which certainly both in elder and modern times, was a symptome either of Ho∣nour or Liberty. For the snatching off the Cap or <HI>Pileus</HI> of <HI>Tarquinius Priscus</HI> by an Eagle, and the placing it on his Head again, was by the <HI>Augurs</HI> interpreted as a pre∣sage of his future possessing the Roman Diadem. When slaves received their manu∣mission they were said to be <HI>ad Pileum vocati,</HI> their liberty was demonstrated to be compleated by putting on a Cap. The <HI>Gladiators</HI> anciently for their magnanimity or personal Courage exprest in mutual Conflicts between themselves in publick Theaters were rewarded as a Guerdon of their Victory <HI>vel Palmâ, Rude, seu Pilo.</HI> The <HI>Lacones</HI> being made free Denisons of <HI>Sparta</HI> more to exemplifie their atchieved Liberty, never went into the Field against the Common Enemy but <HI>Pileati:</HI> Amongst the <HI>Africans</HI> the placing of the <HI>Pileus</HI> or Cap upon the top of a Spear was a tacit citation or sum∣mons to Liberty, and an Intimation to shake off the Fetters of Tyranny. <HI>Erasmus</HI> in his Chiliads calls the Cap <HI>spectatae virtutis Insigne,</HI> and from this he conjectures, that the putting on of Caps on the Heads of Judges, Doctors and Masters of Art, when they were invested with the above mentioned Degrees, derived its first Original, which cu∣stome is still in Force in our publick <HI>Comitia,</HI> or Commencements at the two Univer∣sities of <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Oxford;</HI> and likewise in our Courts of Judicature at the Crea∣tion or Investiture of Serjeants at Law: But to return into that Track from whence this Discourse hath made me straggle: As the Seat was anciently folded up in the Re∣venue of <HI>Nethersoll;</HI> so it is still, mauger all the vicissitudes of Chance, wrapped up in that Propriety which relates to the Descendants of this Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Wingham</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred where it is placed, and was in elder Times one of those eminent Mannors, which augmented the Revenue of the Arch-Bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and being by an unjust Detention ravished away, it was by the indulgent Piety of K. <HI>Edmund</HI> restored in the year 941. If you will see how it was rated in the Time of the Conquerour, <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book will give you this Prospect of it. <HI>Wingham</HI> (says that Record) <HI>est Manerium Archiep. &amp; T. E. R. defendebat se pro</HI> XL <HI>Sullings, &amp; nunc pro</HI> XXX <HI>&amp; valet</HI> C <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> I find nothing memorable of this Mannor after this, but that it was enchanged in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by <HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for other Lands with the Crown; and
<PB N="364" REF="190"/>continued with the Royal Demeasn until the middle of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then it was conveyed by Sale to the City of <HI>London,</HI> which City not many years since passed it a∣way to the instant Owner Sir <HI>William Couper</HI> Knight and Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Wingham</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to it in the seventh year of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the third, by the mediation of <HI>Stephen Langton</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The Colledge of <HI>Wingham</HI> was founded by <HI>John de Peckham</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI> in the year 1278, to be a Colledge or Seminary of Secular Priests, the Head of which Fraternity was called <HI>Praepositus.</HI> This upon the suppression being with its whole Revenue invested in the Crown, K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted the Colledge to Sir <HI>Henry Palmer</HI> (descended from an ancient Family of that Sirname in <HI>Sussex</HI>) An∣cestor to Sir <HI>Henry Palmer</HI> Baronet, now proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Wenderton</HI> is an ancient Seat in this Parish (eminent for its excellent Air, Situation, and prospect) which for many hundreds of years had owners of that Sirname, one of whom called <HI>John Wenderton</HI> is famous in <HI>Fox</HI>'s Martyrologie for the pennance imposed upon him by <HI>William Courtney</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> at his Castle of <HI>Saltwood,</HI> in the year 1390 for being refractory in the Discharge of some Services which were due to his Mannor of <HI>Wingham.</HI> The last of this Name which enjoyed this Seat was <HI>John Wenderton,</HI> who in the first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth passed it away to <HI>William Warham</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and he upon his Decease which was about the year 1533 gave it to his Brother <HI>Hugh Warham,</HI> and his Successor <HI>Hugh Warham</HI> a∣bout the beginning of K. <HI>James</HI> transplanted his right in it by Sale into <HI>William Manwood</HI> Esquire, and he about the beginning of K. <HI>Charles</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Vincent Denne</HI> Gentleman, who left it to his Nephew Mr. <HI>Thomas Denne</HI> of <HI>Grays Inne,</HI> who dying without Issue settled it by Will on his Brother <HI>John Denne</HI> of the <HI>Inner Temple</HI> Esquire, who likewise deceased without Issue, and bequeathed it to his four Maiden Sisters. <HI>Roger Lukyn</HI> Gentleman who matched with one of them purchased the Re∣mainder of the other three, and so is become now sole Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Twitham</HI> in this Parish gave Seat and Sirname to an eminent Family in this Track; <HI>Alan de Twitham</HI> is recorded in the Register of those remarkable <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who supported the Cause and Quarrel of <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Seige of <HI>Acon;</HI> and having continued many Descents Possessors of this Mannor, the Name at last deter∣mined in a Female Heir called <HI>Isabel,</HI> who by matching with <HI>Richard Oxenden</HI> united <HI>Twitham</HI> to the Demeasn of that Family, where the Title hath ever since made so constant and uninterrupted an abode, that it is still the Inheritance of Mr. <HI>Henry Oxenden</HI> of <HI>Brook place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brook place</HI> is the last place of estimate in this Parish, which in elder Times was wrapped up in the Inheritance of <HI>Wenderton,</HI> and having continued many Descents interlinked with this Family, the Name and Title found one Sepulcher together for <HI>Jane Wenderton</HI> the Heir General of the Family by matching with <HI>Richard Oxenden</HI> Gentleman fixed it in his Inheritance, and he much enhaunsed this ancient Seat with Additional Improvements, and from him the Right of Descent hath now made it the Patrimony of Mr. <HI>Henry Oxenden.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whitstaple</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred which surrounds it, and was a Branch of that ample Patrimony, which encreased the Revenue of <HI>Alex. de Baliol,</HI> E. of <HI>Atholl,</HI> and he held this and a place called <HI>Grafton</HI> in this Parish, as likewise a wood called <HI>Northwood</HI> not farre distant, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>John Earl</HI> of <HI>Athol,</HI> who having with an unsuccessful zeal endeavoured to support the sinking Interest of the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> against the violent Eruptions of <HI>Edw.</HI> the first, which like an impetuous Inundation, sought to bear down all the Glory of that Nation, into an irrecoverable Ruine, was in an infortunate Encounter made Captive by that Prince, and being attainted of high Treason, and Executed, his Estate here by Escheat devolved to the Crown, and was by <HI>Edward</HI> the second, in the ninth of his reign granted to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badelesmere:</HI> but he having again lost it by his Re∣volt and Defection in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of that Prince, it revolved to the Crown and continued there, until K. <HI>Edward</HI> the third in the second year of his Reign restored it to <HI>Bartholomew de Badelesmer</HI> his Son, who died in the twelfth year of the abovesaid Prince, and left it to his Brother <HI>Giles de Badelesmer,</HI> and he deceasing
<PB N="365" REF="190"/>without Issue it accrued by <HI>Mawde</HI> one of his Sisters and Coheirs to be the Inheritance of <HI>John Vere</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and he held it at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, and to this Family it remained by the Links of many Descents successively fastned, until at last that Revolution which is made by Sale cast it into the possession of <HI>Phineux;</HI> the last of which who enjoyed it was <HI>John Phineux</HI> Esquire, who concluded in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who by matching with Sir <HI>John Smith</HI> of <HI>Ostenhanger,</HI> knit it to his Estate, from whom by the Devolution of Descent it is now come to confess for proprietary the right honourable <HI>Philip</HI> Viscount <HI>Strangford</HI> his Grand-child.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is <HI>Chestfield,</HI> which was the Mansion of a Family which bore that Sirname, and although I can trace none higher by any publick Record then <HI>James Chestfield,</HI> who paid respective Aid for it at the making the Black Prince Knight, as is manifest by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> collected in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, yet it is upon possible Conjectures to be argued that they were farre more ancient here, because they assumed their Denomination from this Seat; from <HI>Chestfield</HI> about the latter end of the Government of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, it came over by purchase to <HI>Henry Reyner;</HI> but whether he issued from <HI>Borden,</HI> or the <HI>Reyners</HI> of <HI>Borden</HI> from him, I cannot dis∣cover; but it is very probable he determined in four Daughters and Coheirs matched to <HI>Edmund Meade, Jo. Badkin, John Reynolds,</HI> and <HI>John Springate,</HI> who concurred in one united Consent, and by one common conveyance demised their Interest in it to <HI>John Roper</HI> of St. <HI>Dunstans;</HI> from whom <HI>Edward Roper</HI> Esquire, now of <HI>Well-hall</HI> in <HI>Eltham,</HI> claims the instaut Demeasn and Signory of it.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>Grimgill</HI> so vulgarly called, but originally and more properly <HI>Greenshield,</HI> for so it is in Records of an elder Aspect alwayes written. It was the Seat of a Family that was known by that Appellation, and although the Breviat of the private Evidences which relate to it, discover to us owners of the Name no higher then <HI>John Greenshield,</HI> who flourished here about the entrance into the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and who was Father to <HI>Henry Greenshield,</HI> whose Will is Registred at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and which bears Date from the last of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; yet it is more then probable that they were eminent here long before, because the above-recited <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry Greenshields,</HI> were Lords of no despicable or narrow fortune not onely here, but about <HI>Sandwich</HI> and <HI>Wodnesborough</HI> likewise; from <HI>Greenshield</HI> by sale the propriety passed over to <HI>Quekes</HI> of <HI>Quekes</HI> in <HI>Birchington,</HI> who suddenly after being extinguished in a Daughter and Heir, all his Interest in <HI>Grimgill,</HI> was with her transported in Marriage to <HI>Crispe,</HI> originally extracted out of the County of <HI>Glocester;</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Crispe</HI> Esquire held his Shrievalty here, which was in the second year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> from <HI>Crispe</HI> it was by purchase conveyed into the Revenue of <HI>Paramour,</HI> where after it had for several years been fixed, it was very lately taken off from this Family, and by Sale made the Possession of Mr. <HI>Twiman</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, here was <HI>Condies-place</HI> which was the Residence of <HI>John Condie,</HI> who had in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third contracted upon himself, (which is yet indelibly fixed upon his Memory) a Character of high Account, because he had made an emi∣nent Enemie of the Kings Captive <HI>in Congressu Bellico,</HI> those are the words of the Record in a personal Combat; for which he had thirty pound <HI>per Annum</HI> setled upon him out of the Kings Profits of the <HI>Staple</HI> at <HI>Canterbury</HI> by Charter or Grant from <HI>Edward</HI> the third dated the seventh day of <HI>July</HI> in the fourteenth year of his reign. Now if you will know, where this memorable Action was commenced, the same Record will in∣form you, that the Scene of it was laid at <HI>Swine</HI> in <HI>Normandy:</HI> But to proceed: this Man not long after he was thus adorned with these Tophies of Honour, paid that Debt to Nature, which we all owe, and left <HI>Condies Hall</HI> to his Son <HI>William Condy,</HI> who dying without any lawful Issue, <HI>Margaret Condy</HI> one of his Sisters became his Co-heir, who by her espousals with <HI>Robert Grubbe</HI> made <HI>Condies Hall</HI> parcel of his Demeasn; but he likewise in the Age subsequent to this determining in Females, <HI>Agnes</HI> one of his Co∣heirs being wedded to <HI>John Isaack</HI> of <HI>Blackmanbery</HI> in <HI>Bridge,</HI> did much swell and improve his Patrimony, with that Additional Estate she united to his, and here in this Name was the possession for sundry Descents resident, even till our Fathers Memory. But here for want of Intelligence, I can proceed no farther; and indeed the Place being fallen from its original Name by Disuse, and that Repute it was under, when it was
<PB N="366" REF="191"/>possest by so noble proprietaries, is now onely fit to find the Common Sepulcher of Oblivion.</P>
<P><HI>Wicheling</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was folded up in the Patrimony of the noble Family of <HI>Cobham</HI> of <HI>Sterborough</HI> issued out f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the <HI>Cobhams</HI> of <HI>Cobham Hall,</HI> and of this Family was <HI>Reginald de Cobham,</HI> who was frequently summoned to sit in Parlia∣ment as Baron, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and from this worthy person did this Mannor by successive Devolution come down to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> of <HI>Sterborough,</HI> who deceased in the eleventh of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and left his Estate here and else∣where, to <HI>Anne</HI> his sole Daughter and Heir marched to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Borough</HI> called to sit in Parliament as Baron of <HI>Sterborough</HI> and <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and from him both the Title of Baron and of this Mannor flowed down successively to his Grandchild <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Borough,</HI> who passed away the Inheritance to <HI>Edward Filmer</HI> Esquire, whose Grand-child Sir <HI>Edward Filmer</HI> in relation to that purchase, challenges the instant right and revenue of it.</P>
<P><HI>Willesborough</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge</HI> has nothing to make it me∣morable but that it was a principal piece of that revenue which in this County related to the noble and ancient Family of <HI>Brent;</HI> of which was <HI>Falcatius de Brent,</HI> a man whom our <HI>English</HI> History pencils out to us under a Character of the most perfect Courage and Magnanimity, though disordered with some wild Sallies and Excesses: which peradventure may be attributed to the Evaporations of youth, which is alwayes volatile and airy, rather then to any setled and contracted Habit of vitious Distem∣pers, and mutinous passions which was lodged within Him. But to proceed: when <HI>Willesborough</HI> had by a successive thread of many Ages been guided along through seve∣ral Descents down to <HI>John Brent,</HI> he died and left <HI>John Brent</HI> his Heir, who expiring without Issue, <HI>Margaret</HI> his eldest Sister became the Inheritrix of all his possessions, and she being matched with <HI>John Dering</HI> Esquire of <HI>Surrenden Dering,</HI> this place by Female right became transplanted into the Patrimony of that Name and Family, and Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> about the year 1635, conveyed it to <HI>Robert Scot</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> Esquire, whose Son and Heir <HI>Thomas Scot</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> Esquire is now proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Wilmington</HI> in Hundred of <HI>Dartford</HI> resolves it self into two Mannors which exact a peculiar Cognisance, and the first is <HI>Rue Hill</HI> (so it was anciently written though now by vulgar Acceptation it is called <HI>Rowe Hill.</HI>) It was in Ages of a higher Track, the pa∣trimony of an illustrious and generous Family called <HI>Gise,</HI> who were in those times as eminent for the largeness of their possessions, as they were for the Antiquity of their Extraction; and from hence were the <HI>Gises</HI> of the Counties of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Gloucester</HI> originally sprouted out. <HI>Anselmus de Gise</HI> had a Charter of Free Warren granted to his Lands at <HI>Rue Hill</HI> in <HI>Wilmington,</HI> in the twenty second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; but it appears the Possession of this place, invested and fortified with this Grant was not long after united to this Family; for <HI>John Gise</HI> this mans Grand-child sold it to <HI>Nicholas Brember,</HI> who in the twelfth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, being blasted with an impeachment of high Treason, fell an Oblation to the fury of those Lords, who upon pretence of asserting the publick Liberty, sought to fetter up the majesty and prerogative of their Prince, within those narrow Restraints, and Limits which they prescribed to empale it in, and pare off the power of the Crown (which like <HI>Sampson</HI>'s Locks being shaved Kings remain like other men.) Upon his attaint <HI>Rue Hill</HI> resolved into the revenue of the Crown, and King <HI>Richard</HI> the second in the fourteenth year of his reign granted it to <HI>Adam Bamme</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and in his Lineage was the Inheritance of it sundry Generations wrapt up, till in our Grand-fathers memory it was alienated to <HI>Brett;</HI> from whose successor the same Alteration rowled the possession not many years since into <HI>Smith.</HI></P>
<P>The second is <HI>Highlands</HI> which was parcel of the Demeasn of the Knights of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and upon the Dissolution of their Alberge here in <HI>England,</HI> was gran∣ted about the thirty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> and Sir <HI>Maurice Dennis;</HI> the last of which passed away his Concernment in it to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile</HI> by whose Daughter and Co-heir called <HI>Amy Moile,</HI> it came to be possest by
<PB N="367" REF="191"/>Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe;</HI> who left it to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe</HI> who conveyed it to his Brother Mr. <HI>Reginald Kempe,</HI> who in our Fathers memory passed it away to <HI>Lancelot Bathurst</HI> Esquire, Father to Sir <HI>Edward Bathurst,</HI> who is the instant proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Wodnesborough</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Eastrie,</HI> and spreads it self into many places of no despicable Account. First there is <HI>Shelving,</HI> which was as high as any Evidence, can waft us to discover, the Demeasn of <HI>Houghham</HI> of <HI>Hougham</HI> by <HI>Dover,</HI> a Family rooted in as deep Antiquity as any in this Track. <HI>Robert de Hougham</HI> is enrolled in an ancient Register of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who supported the cause and Quarrel of <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Seige of <HI>Acon.</HI> Sir <HI>Robert de Hougham</HI> his Son died possest of it in the second year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and left <HI>Robert Hougham</HI> his Heir, who de∣termined in Daughters and Co-heirs; so that <HI>Benedicta Houghham</HI> one of them being married to <HI>John Shelving,</HI> this became his Demeasn, where he erected a House, upon which he fixed his Sirname, and called it <HI>Shelving,</HI> which in those Times was of con∣siderable Repute, though since by the frequent impressions of Age, it is shrunk into De∣cay and Obscurity, from <HI>Shelving</HI> one Moitie of it by Sale was transmitted to <HI>St. Leger,</HI> and so continued distinguished in the Interest of it, till both <HI>Shelving</HI> and <HI>St. Leger</HI> did by a mutual Concurrence pass away their joynt right in it to <HI>Dynley:</HI> where it had not long been Seated, but the like Fatality transferred the Possession of it to <HI>White;</HI> and here the Title of it was as unfixt and unstable also: for from this Family by purchase it was carried into the Revenue of <HI>Knight,</HI> who in our memory altered his Interest in it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Solomon Hougham</HI> of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> primitively issued out in a Collateral Line from Sir <HI>Robert Hougham,</HI> upon whose late Decease his Son and Heir Mr. <HI>Richard Hougham</HI> is now possessor of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ringleton</HI> does secondly exact some Remembrance: It was anciently the Interest of <HI>Perot;</HI> for <HI>Thomas Perot</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; but when this Name was extinguished in a Daughter and Heir, <HI>William Langley</HI> by matching with Her entituled himself to the Possession of this place, in which Family the Inheritance for sundry Generations was settled, till the Vicissitude of Time by Sale conveyed it into the Demeasn of <HI>John White,</HI> who was originally a Mer∣chant of the <HI>Staple,</HI> and did by several Acts of exemplary Munificence, evidence him∣self to be a liberal Benefactor to <HI>Canterbury.</HI> But long it was not fastned to the Possession of this Name; for his Successor alienated it to <HI>Butler</HI> of <HI>Heronden</HI> in <HI>Eastrie,</HI> from which Family <HI>Ringleton</HI> by the same Mutation was brought to own the Possession of <HI>Neame,</HI> and his Son <HI>Daniel Neame</HI> sold it to <HI>Spencer</HI> of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> whose Successor <HI>Nicholas Spencer</HI> dying without Issue, his Sister who was wedded to <HI>Hughs</HI> descended from <HI>Hughs</HI> of <HI>Middleton Stony</HI> in the County of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who was branched out from the <HI>Hughs</HI> of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> by a Relative right deduced from that Alliance, has planted the present Possession in the Patrimony of that Name and Family.</P>
<P>Thirdly upper <HI>Hamwold</HI> may fall under a Disquisition, because it was wound up in the Estate and Propriety of <HI>Greenshield,</HI> whose principal residence was at <HI>Greenshield</HI> in <HI>Whitstaple,</HI> corruptly called <HI>Grimgil,</HI> where I have spoken more largely of this Family: onely this I shall add, that <HI>Henry Greenshield,</HI> who died in the last year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, was a munificent Benefactor to the poor and other indigent and necessitous people of the Town of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> to whom he bequeaths by his last Testament very libe∣ral Donations for their relief and support: After this Family of <HI>Greenshield</HI> was moul∣dered away at <HI>Hamwold,</HI> I find the <HI>Elis's</HI> invested in the Possession, but whether by Alli∣ance or Purchase I cannot discover. After they went out, the Family of <HI>Francis</HI> was by Purchase from them, seated in the Inheritance, to whose Interest it was not many years united, for from them it passed away by Sale to <HI>Wilson,</HI> where the Title was not less violate, and cursory; for from <HI>Wilson</HI> the like Alienation translated the right of it into <HI>Parboe,</HI> whose Widow Mrs. <HI>Parboe</HI> does now enjoy it, as being made part of her Jointure when first she matched with <HI>Parboe.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Grove</HI> and upper <HI>Hamwold</HI> are two little Mannors circumscribed likewise within the Limits of <HI>Wodnesborough;</HI> and were in the thirty second year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third the Inheritance of <HI>Pet. de Goldesburgh,</HI> or <HI>Goldesborough,</HI> but the Title made no long abode in this Name after this Man's <HI>Exit;</HI> for both, about the latter End of <HI>Richard</HI> the second,
<PB N="368" REF="192"/>were conveyed to <HI>Langley</HI> of <HI>Knowlton,</HI> from whom as suddain a Devolution, about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fixth, passed them over to Sir <HI>John White</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> a Merchant of the <HI>Staple,</HI> and he died possest of them in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, as appears, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 25. After this Family was worn out, I find <HI>Stokes</HI> planted in the Possession; from which Name about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, they came over by Purchase to one <HI>Nicholas Mois</HI> Gentleman, and when that Family deserted the Possession which was in our Grand-fathers Remembrance a Fatality pro∣portionate to the former, made them both parcel of the Patrimony of <HI>Everard,</HI> by whom not many years since, they were alienated to <HI>James</HI> to the Inheritance of which Family they remain yet linked and united.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Poltmans</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Poultmans</HI> yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Fa∣mily of some Estimate in this Track, who had here a Castellated Mansion, invested with a Moat, and continued Lords of this Habitation, until <HI>Peter Poltman</HI> by descen∣dant right came to be possest of it, and he about the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second conveyed it by Fine to <HI>Langley</HI> of <HI>Knowlton,</HI> in whom the Propriety was setled but until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and then it was passed away by Sale to Sir <HI>John White:</HI> who, dying seised of it in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, by Testament ordered it to be sold for the improvement of Acts of Charity, and pious Uses, and was according to the Tenor of his will conveyed by Sale to <HI>Boteler</HI> of <HI>He∣ronden</HI> in <HI>Eastry,</HI> and there it made its abode until our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was passed away to <HI>Benskin,</HI> in which Family the Title is yet permanent.</P>
<P><HI>Woditon</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Kinghamford</HI> hath three places in it of considerable Estimate. The first is <HI>Gedding</HI> which K. <HI>Cedwall</HI> and <HI>Keneldrith</HI> his Queen, in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 693 gave to <HI>Theodore</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Covent of <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> free (as the original Donation informs me) as <HI>Adesham,</HI> and was by them afterwards assigned to the Sacrist or Sexton of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> for his lively∣hood and Subsistance, an Office in elder Times of no contemptible Account in the Repute and Vogue of the Monks of that Cloister; for the sacred Utensils of the Church were not only committed to his Care and Custody, but he was likewise to make Preparation for the Celebration of the Mass, and the performance of other divine and sacred Officers, and because he might be more active and vigorous in the Managery and execution of his Trust, these under-Officers were to be subservient and and ministerial to him, their Catalogue sollows.</P>

<P>For which last (the rest being of easie understanding,) I conceive it was one that either wrought the Church Vestments, or Hangings, and the like, in Gold, or that re∣freshed them, when they were dim or tarnished. But to proceed: this Mannor being with the Remainder of the Revenue of the Priory of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> surrendred into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign, who afterwards in the thirty first of his Government granted it to Mr. <HI>Edward Foch</HI> of <HI>Hells Court</HI> in this Parish; from whom it descended to <HI>Thomas Foch</HI> of <HI>Monkton</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Thanet</HI> Esquire, who deceasing not many years since gave it to his second Son Major <HI>John Foch</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and he hath lately passed it away to his elder Brother <HI>Thomas Foch</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Hells</HI> is a second place of Note, which for divers Descents, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, confessed no other Proprietaries, but <HI>Hells</HI> of <HI>Hell. Court</HI> in <HI>Ash:</HI> and then, they abandoning the Possession, it came to be enjoyed by <HI>Merywether,</HI> and remained linked to the Patrimony of this Name, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then by a Female Inheritrix is came to confess the Signory of <HI>Foch,</HI> in
<PB N="369" REF="192"/>Right of which Alliance it is now the Inheritance of <HI>Thomas Foch</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Wickham Bushes</HI> is another Mannor which has its Situation within the Limits of <HI>Woditon,</HI> and was, as the Light of the most ancient Evidences does guide us to believe, the Patrimony of <HI>Guldeford;</HI> for <HI>Henry de Guldeford,</HI> (as the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> discovers to us) did hold it by Knights Service, of <HI>Geffrey de Say,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third; but in a Descent or two after, this Family was shrunk away from the posses∣sion of this place, and then the ancient and illustrious Family of <HI>Digge</HI> of <HI>Digge's Court</HI> in <HI>Berham,</HI> was the next which succeeded in the Propriety and Inheritance, and to this Name was the Title of this place, by a successive Series of many Generations fastned, till in our Fathers Memory it was by sale rent off, and by that Alienation linked to the Revenue of <HI>Coppen,</HI> in whose Demeasn the Interest of it at this Day con∣tinues included.</P>
<P><HI>Woodchurch</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackbourn,</HI> was the Habitation of a Family of as deep Root in Antiquity as any in this Track, who extracted their Sirname, as well as borrow∣ed their first Original, from this place. <HI>Roger de Woodchurch</HI> is the first who does occurre, who in the ancient Evidences and the Deeds of this place, which are not cloistered within any Date finds a frequent Mention, and from him (as appears by an old Pedigree of this Family) did it devolve to his Grandchild Sir <HI>Simon de Woodchurch,</HI> who is in the Register of those eminent Persons who accompanied <HI>Edward</HI> the first in his Victori∣ous and triumphant Expedition into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where his Victories entailed upon his Memory the Character of <HI>Malleus Scotorum,</HI> but in this Sir <HI>Simon:</HI> the Name though not the Male Line determined, for he by matching with <HI>Susan,</HI> Heir of <HI>Henry le Clerke</HI> of <HI>Munfidde,</HI> brought a large Inheritance to own the Signory of <HI>Woodchurch;</HI> and his Successors in Gratitude to a Family which had added so much of splendor, and annexed so plentiful a Revenue to this Name, altered their paternal Appellation from <HI>Wood∣church</HI> to <HI>Clerke;</HI> and so in all their Deeds subsequent to this Match, have written <HI>Clerke</HI> aliàs <HI>Woodchurch</HI> ever since. But as all Families have their Descent and Period, as well as Gradation and Ascent, so had this; for after this Mannor had for so many hundred years continued in this Family which had been productive of Men which had been planted in places of the greatest Eminence, by which they were obliged to per∣form Service to their Country, it came down at last to <HI>Humfrey Clerk</HI> Esquire, who about the year 1594, passed it away by Sale to <HI>Walter Harlackenden</HI> Esquire; by whose Daughter and Heir called <HI>Deborah Harlackenden,</HI> it was united to the Revenue of Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Knight and Baronet: upon whose late Decease it is now descended to his Grand-child Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Baronet, who is entitled to the instant Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Pleurinden</HI> in this Parish is a Branch of that Estate which fell under the Signory of the ancient and Knightly Family of <HI>Engham,</HI> very frequently in old Deeds and other Monuments written <HI>Edingham,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Hengham:</HI> In a Deed wherein there is mention of a Match between ....... one of the Co-heirs of Sir <HI>Stephen de Penchester,</HI> and <HI>Henry de Cobham,</HI> and wherein some Land is conveyed over to <HI>Cobham,</HI> there are these Persons recorded to be <HI>Testes</HI> to it, <HI>William de Savage, William de Oure, Otho de Grandison,</HI> and <HI>Roger de Hengham.</HI> The Deed is very ancient, and though not con∣fined to any strict or precise Date, yet commences from the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and from this <HI>Roger</HI> did <HI>Vincent Engham</HI> Esquire lineally descend, who in the ....... year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away by Sale to <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Esquire, Grand-father to Sir <HI>Roger Twisden</HI> Baronet, in whom is fixed the instant Propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Tounland</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Woodchurch</HI> which had anciently Owners of that Sir∣name. <HI>Rafe de la Thun</HI> died seised of this Mannor and other Lands in <HI>Woodchurch</HI> the for∣ty third year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the third: After him I find <HI>Richard de Tunland</HI> possest of it in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the first; and had Issue <HI>Thomas de Tunl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd</HI> who died seised of it in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 13. and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>John de Tunland,</HI> who was an eminent Benefactor to the priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> to which Covent he added this Mannor to improve their Revenue at the time of his Decease, which was in the forty seventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and here it remained until the Dissolution, and then it was granted by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell:</HI> and after his Attaint in the thirty second year of his reign, being
<PB N="370" REF="193"/>escheated, it was in the thirty fifth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth regranted to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile</HI> Chancellor of the Court of Augmentation, and he in the thirty sixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, passed it away by Sale to <HI>William Goodwin,</HI> and <HI>Tho. Ancos,</HI> and they not long after alienated their Right in it to <HI>Lucas:</HI> in which Family it continued but un∣til the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>Thomas Godfrey,</HI> whose Son <HI>James Godfrey</HI> in the tenth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> transferred it by the like Devolution to <HI>Mary Guldford;</HI> and she again in the eleventh year of that Princess demised it to <HI>Richard Guldford,</HI> and he not long after sold it away to <HI>Shelley</HI> of <HI>Michel∣grove,</HI> and <HI>John Shelley</HI> as I find by a Court Roll relating to this place, held it in the eighteenth of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and in the Descendant of this Name and Family is the In∣heritance of it, if I be not misinformed, at this instant placed.</P>
<P><HI>Henherst</HI> is the last place considerable in <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> which was the possession of a Family of that Denomination, of whom I have spoken at <HI>Stapleherst,</HI> where they en∣joyed another Mannor of this Name, and of which Family this here was but a Cadet or younger Slip, and was written sometimes <HI>Henherst,</HI> and as often in old Deeds <HI>Eng∣herst,</HI> and continued Owners of this place, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then it devolved to Sir <HI>Thomas Hengherst,</HI> who was the last of that Name which held this place, for he dying without Issue Male, <HI>Humfrey Wise</HI> who had matched with his Daughter and Heir in her right was invested in the Inheritance of it, but he deceasing likewise without Issue Male, his sole Inheritrix united it by marriage to the Revenue of her Husband Mr. <HI>Robert Masters,</HI> Great Grand-father to Mr. <HI>Edward Masters</HI> of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> in whom the propriety of this place is at this prefent continued.</P>
<P><HI>Henden</HI> likewise is an Appendage to <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> from whence certainly the Name of <HI>Henden</HI> originally streamed out, though it be brought down to our Times in so crooked and perplexed a Chanel, that we cannot discover it in all the wandrings and Digressions of it, though the Family was made more conspicuous, by Sir <HI>Edward Henden</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer to the late King <HI>Charles:</HI> who for his clear speculation and insight into the deepest and most mysterious Intrigues of the Mu∣nicipal Law of <HI>England,</HI> was commonly called the Picklock of it. But this is a Diver∣sion: The ancient Proprietaries of <HI>Henden,</HI> represented to us by the eldest Records, were the Lords <HI>Burwash,</HI> very frequently written <HI>Burghherst,</HI> and <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burwash</HI> had a Charter of Free Warren granted to <HI>Henden,</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. And when this Family had deserted the Possession of this place, the next which successively held it were the <HI>Capells</HI> of <HI>Capells Court</HI> in <HI>Ivie-Church,</HI> and <HI>Richard Capell</HI> died seised of it in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second: and here, after it had been for some Generations fixed, the Name resolved into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched unto <HI>Harlackenden,</HI> and so it became twisted into the Revenue of that Family, and so remained till <HI>Deborah Harlackenden</HI> the Heir General of <HI>Walter Harlackenden,</HI> a Branch of this Stock, by being wedded to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Knight and Baronet, Grand-father to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> now of <HI>Tunstall</HI> Baronet, wound it up in the Demeasn and Interest of that Honourable Family.</P>
<P>The <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Harlackenden</HI> is situated in this Parish, and has been for many hun∣dred of years the Patrimonial Demeasn of that Name and Family, as appears by a Tomb in the Church of <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> whose Inscription signifies that one of them lies enterr'd there a little after the Conquest: and though the Character be in the proporti∣on and Shape of it very much like that which was in use in the reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and so makes the Truth of it disputable, yet to this 'tis answered, that there was an old Tombstone there before, with the same Inscription upon it, in∣sculped peradventure in a <HI>Saxon</HI> Character, or such an one as was proportionate to that time in which that person died, who lies there entombed: which being decayed his Successors to perpetuate and inforce the Memory of so ancient a Predecessor, fixed this Stone upon his Grave, and, to make the Memorial more obvious, did cause the Epitaph to be engraven in such a Letter, as was Customary to the Time of that Prince, in whose reign it was laid upon the Ashes beneath. In <HI>Greys Inne</HI> Hall by particular Inspection I have observed the Arms of this Family, <HI>viz. Azure A fesse Ermin between three Lions Heads erased Or,</HI> to be painted in an upper Window, which appears to be of very venerable Antiquity, and this justifies those fair Attributes of Noble, Ancient, and Illustrious, which may with very good Reason be entituled to this Family, of

<P><HI>Edingham,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Engham,</HI> is the last place of Account within the Verge of <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> and was, in Times of elder date, before they transplanted themselves to <HI>Singleton</HI> in Great <HI>Chart,</HI> the Mansion of the <HI>Enghams:</HI> who as they placed here their Seat, extracted from hence to their Sirname a Family doubtless of profound Antiquity, and no less Reputation; as may appear by those large Possessions which they were interessed in, in several parts of <HI>Romney Mersh,</HI> written in old Records sometimes <HI>Edingham,</HI> and by Contraction <HI>Engham,</HI> and very frequently <HI>Hengham.</HI> And it is very probable from the Identity of the Name, that <HI>Rafe de Hengham</HI> the eminent Lord Chief Justice in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first was of this Family.

<P>It appears that the Commissions of Sewers which are now yearly issued for to make a diligent Inspection into those Banks and the Defects of them, which protect and se∣cure the adjacent Mershes from the encroachments, and eruptions of the Thames was of authentick and ancient use; for a Commission went out (as is manifest by <HI>Pat.</HI> 17. <HI>Edwardi secundi</HI>) for repairing a very great Breach the waters by an Inundation had made into the Mershes which lie extended between <HI>Wolwich</HI> and <HI>Greenewich.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Yaldham</HI> or <HI>Aldham</HI> is another Seat of considerable Account in <HI>Wrotham,</HI> especially since it celebrates the Memory of <HI>Thomas de Aldham,</HI> who by a pious Assistance supported the Arms and Cause of <HI>Richard</HI> the first when he was engaged at the Siege of <HI>Acon:</HI> and from him it descended to Sir <HI>Thomas de Aldham,</HI> who determining in three Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Margery</HI> one of them by matching with <HI>Martin de Peckham,</HI> descended from <HI>John de Peckham</HI> (who likewise fills up the Catalogue of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who by their signal Courage made themselves considerable under <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Acon.</HI>) did augment his Patrimony by the Union of hers at this place to it.

<P><HI>Pleckston</HI> was formerly a Borough appertaining to <HI>Wrotham:</HI> but by an ordinance of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, bearing Date from the year of our Lord, 1647, it was enacted, there should be a Collection thoroughout this County, towards the erecting a Parochial Church at this place, and the establishing a Congre∣gation proportionate to it, which was effected accordingly; so that now it hath the Repute of a Parish, seperate and distinct from <HI>Wrotham,</HI> and contains within its Limits the Mannor of <HI>Sore,</HI> which was in times of a more ancient Complexion par∣cel of the patrimony of the <HI>Colepepers</HI> of <HI>Preston</HI> in <HI>Alresford;</HI> for <HI>Walter Colepeper,</HI> dyed possest of it, in the first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, from whom an uninterrupted flowing of Descent, wafted the Title down to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Preston,</HI> who passed it away to <HI>Nicholas Miller</HI> Esquire, of <HI>Horsnells Crouch</HI> in <HI>Wrotham,</HI> and he upon his decease, disposed of his Right in it to his Nephew Sir <HI>Nicholas Miller</HI> of <HI>Oxenhoath,</HI> upon whose late Decease, it descended to his Son and Heir <HI>Humphrey Miller</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Wormsell</HI> is a small despicable Parish, in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorn,</HI> and was ever esteemed an Appendage to the Mannor of <HI>Boughton Malherbe,</HI> and had ever the same Proprietaries, as namely, <HI>Gatton, Dene, Corbie,</HI> and lastly <HI>Wotton;</HI> in which last Family it remained untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was passed away to <HI>Dynley,</HI> where it rested untill our Fathers Memory; and then it was con∣veyed to <HI>Sydley,</HI> so that it now owns the propriety of Sir <HI>Charles Sydley</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Wouldham</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Larkefield,</HI> and was given to <HI>Ernulf</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> by <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the year 762, who for this and other his Munificent Donations, by which he so much enlarged, and multiplyed the Revenue of the Sea at <HI>Rochester,</HI> is represented to us at this day, by the Records of that Church, under the Character and Pourtraicture of <HI>pius Ethelbertus:</HI> but the Steeple, and much of the Fabrick of the Church, owe their original to the Charity and Beneficence of <HI>Stephen Slegge,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and bequeathed by his Will in the thirty sixth year of that Prince's reign, a 100.

<P><HI>Rings</HI> is a small Mannor that spreads it self partly into <HI>Wouldham,</HI> and partly into the Parish of St. <HI>Margarets</HI> not far distant, but was eminent formerly, because it was the Demeasn in part of the noble Family of <HI>Cosington</HI> of <HI>Cosington</HI> in <HI>Alresford,</HI> the other Moiety acknowledging the Signory of <HI>Carter; Cosington</HI> sold his proportion to <HI>Whorne</HI> of <HI>Whornes-place</HI> in <HI>Cuckston;</HI> and <HI>Carter</HI> alienated his to <HI>Laurence,</HI> who not long after, by a mutual Deed of Conveyance, passed away their joynt Interest in it to <HI>Hadds</HI> of <HI>Meriam-court</HI> in <HI>VVicheling,</HI> who was scarce setled in his new purchase, but he by Sale transplanted his right in it into <HI>Thomas Roydon</HI> of <HI>Roydon-court</HI> in <HI>Peck∣ham,</HI> who was one of those, who in the thirty first year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, altered, by Act of Parliament, their possessions from the Nature and Tenure of Gavelkind to that of Knights Service. From <HI>Roydon,</HI> this place (as appears by the private Eviden∣ces of Mr. <HI>John Marsham</HI>) by the former Alienation, was carried into the Demeasn of <HI>Brockhull</HI> of <HI>Aldington Septuans</HI> in <HI>Thurnham,</HI> where the possession was not long resident; for <HI>Henry Brockhull</HI> conveyed it away to <HI>Nicholas Lewson</HI> of the County of <HI>Stafford,</HI> whose Grandchild Sir <HI>Richard Lewson,</HI> desiring to circumscribe his Revenue within the more close circumference of <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> sold his Concernment here to <HI>John Marsham</HI> Esquire, originally extracted out of <HI>Norfolk:</HI> to whose Name, those learned pieces which he hath made publick, as namely his accurate Disquisitions upon <HI>Daniel;</HI> and his elaborate Preface, prefixed to the monastick Survey, styled <HI>Monasti∣cum Anglicanum;</HI> shall stand in future Ages, both Urn and Epitaph.</P>
<P><HI>Starkeys</HI> is another place wholly involved within the Limits of <HI>VVouldham,</HI> but formerly it was not known by this Name: for in Times of elder Aspect I believe it could scarce entitle it self to any Mansion though it had the Repute of a Mannor, and under that Notion is it mentioned to be held by Sir <HI>John Buckland,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the Book called <HI>Feoda Militum</HI> kept in the Exchequer, where it is styled the Mannor of <HI>Little-VVouldham.</HI> After this Family
<PB N="374" REF="195"/>was worn out, the <HI>Newmans</HI> were the next; who, by purchase from them, became possessors of the Fee, but stayed not long in the Tenure of it; for in a Descent or two after, <HI>Henry Newman</HI> alienated the Inheritance to <HI>Humphrey Starkey</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, who erected here that House, which ever since hath been adopted into his Name; he was descended from the <HI>Starkyes</HI> of <HI>VVrenbery</HI> and <HI>Oulton</HI> in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and lyes entombed under a fair Mo∣nument, in the Parish Church of St. <HI>Leonards Shorditch</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> which the Inju∣ries of time, and impious Mechanicks together have much empaired, but it seems the Name of the House could not entail it on his posterity, for his Successor sold it to Sir <HI>John Rainsford,</HI> a man of great Demeasne about <HI>Lose, East</HI> and <HI>VVest-Barming,</HI> and of no lesse Authority with <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; who not long after conveyed it over to <HI>Lambe;</HI> from whom the Fate of Sale, brought the Inheritance to <HI>Nicholas Lewson</HI> Esquire, whose Grandchild Sir <HI>Richard Lewson,</HI> upon those motives which incited him to alienate <HI>Rings,</HI> which was to contract his whole De∣measne into <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> transferred his Right in this likewise, to <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Beaulies-court</HI> is the last place of Note in this Parish to be discoursed upon: it was formerly in Records written <HI>Sellers,</HI> and gave Sirname to a Family known by that Appellation; for <HI>John at Seller</HI> (under that Orthography he is recorded in the Book of <HI>Aide</HI>) held this place by Knights Service of the Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and the Arms of this Family, stand depicted in an old pane of Glasse, yet remaining in <HI>VVouldham-church, videlicet Argent a Salteir between four Mullets Gules,</HI> and is now quartered by <HI>Beauly;</HI> for when this Name con∣cluded in a Female Heir, she by her espousals with <HI>Beauly,</HI> knit this Seat and the pro∣priety of it to their patrimony; who, for some Additions they angmented the House with, changed the Name of <HI>Sellers</HI> into <HI>Beaulies-court,</HI> and by a Right brought down to him by a Chain of Sundry Generations from the former Alliance, does Mr. <HI>Thomas Beauly,</HI> now of <HI>London</HI> Merchant, claim his present Interest in it.</P>
<P><HI>VVye</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and is in Latine Re∣cords frequently called <HI>Vaga,</HI> or wandring, and in the British Dialect it imports as much, from whence they imposed the Name of <HI>VVye,</HI> on a noted River in <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> from its crooked and perplexed Digressions. It was a Mannor which belonged to the Crown before the Conquest, and King <HI>VVilliam</HI> the first, gave it to <HI>Battell</HI> Abby: I recite the Donation, because it reserves the Earl of <HI>Kents Deniers</HI> or <HI>tertium Denarium,</HI> a sin∣gular Testimony of grounding and conferring the Dignity, and justifies the unparal∣lelled Title it hath, of being called <HI>Regale Manerium de VVye,</HI> The Royal Mannor of <HI>VVye;</HI> for the Signory of 22 Towns lying crosse the Country from hence to <HI>Battell</HI> pertain unto it.</P>
<P><HI>Aldons, Dods, VVest-Sture, Bromsford, Shotenton,</HI> with the Mannor of the Vica∣ridge were given by <HI>John Kempe,</HI> first Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and Lord Chancel∣lor of <HI>England,</HI> and after Cardinal to the Colledge of <HI>VVye,</HI> which he had erected and dedicated to St. <HI>Martin</HI> and St. <HI>Gregory;</HI> which, upon the Suppression, were setled in the patrimony of the Crown, till Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> granted them to her Kinsman <HI>Henry Cary</HI> Baron of <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> whose Grandchild <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Dover,</HI> not many years since conveyed them to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch</HI> Earl of <HI>VVinchelsey,</HI> whose Son <HI>Heneage</HI> Earl of <HI>VVinchelsey,</HI> has the instant Signory of them.</P>
<P><HI>Ollantigh</HI> was a place of no Account, till Cardinal <HI>Kemp</HI> instituted here an Oratory or Chappel, which is yet annexed to the House, but the Mansion it self was built by Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe,</HI> made Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> at the marriage of Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> eldest Son to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and in this Name the possession continued, till Sir <HI>Thomas Kempe</HI> this mans Successor deceased without Issue-male, and left four Daughters and Coheirs, matched with <HI>Diggs, Cutts, Chichley,</HI> and <HI>Skipwith;</HI> who all by mutual Consent did devest themselves of their right to this place, and by Sale transmitted it to Sir <HI>Timothy Thornhil,</HI> whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>Hen.

<P><HI>Wilmington</HI> is an ancient Seat in this Parish which had formerly the Reputation of a Mannor, and was parcel of the Revenue of the noble Family of <HI>Corbie;</HI> for <HI>Robert de Corbie</HI> did enjoy it at his Death, which was in the thirty ninth year of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the third: and after this Family was dislodged from the Possession, the <HI>Chivalers</HI> came in and enjoyed the Inheritance, for <HI>William Chivaler</HI> held it at his Decease, which was in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, after whom <HI>John Mowbray</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> possest it about the year 1461, who dying without Issue, <HI>John Howard</HI> his Kinsman was invested with the Title of Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> as being descended from the Lady <HI>Margaret</HI> Daughter of <HI>Thomas de Brotherton</HI> first Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> in the first year of <HI>Richard</HI> the third, and with his Title he had the Inheritance of <HI>Wilmington,</HI> which did not remain knit any long space to his Name: for in the year 1486, he found an un∣timely Sepulcher with his Master <HI>Richard</HI> the third in the Ruines of <HI>Bosworth Field,</HI> where he offered up his Life to the Cause of that Prince, as a grateful Expiation of those Favours which he had received from his Bounty, after whose Decease this place by Escheat was swallowed up in the revenue of the Crown, where the Possession slum∣bered, till K. <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth about the second year of his reign granted it to <HI>Edward Paget</HI> Esquire, in which Family it resided until our Fathers Memory, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Barrow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bilting</HI> is another place in <HI>Wye</HI> of no vulgar Estimate. It lies partly in <HI>Godmersham,</HI> and partly in this Parish, and was for many hundred years the patrimony of a Family which bore that Sirname, and remained linked to their Demeasn, until the ninth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> and then <HI>William Bilting</HI> deceasing without Issue, <HI>Arthur Franklin,</HI> and <HI>Richard Vidian</HI> were found to be his Heirs, and upon the Division of the Estate into parcels, this swelled the Estate of <HI>Franklin</HI> with a new Addition, and continued in that Name, until not many years since partly by Sale, and partly by Marriage it was settled upon Mr. <HI>William Cowper</HI> of <HI>Maidstone,</HI> upon whose late Decease it is now devolved by successive Right to his Descendant Mr. ....... <HI>Cowper</HI> now in his Mi∣noritie.</P>
<P><HI>Perry Court</HI> is the next place which obliges us to a Consideration. It was wrapped up, in that Demeasn which related to the Colledge of <HI>Wye,</HI> and was purchased by Cardinal <HI>John Kempe</HI> of <HI>Thomas Aldon</HI> (whose Ancestors had held it many De∣scents before) in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, and by him annexed to the Colledge above mentioned, of his own Institution and Foundation: But the publick Dissolution in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth having snatched it away, it was by the Grant of that Prince made the Inheritance of Mr. <HI>John Buckler,</HI> who about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, passed it away to Sir <HI>William Damsell</HI> emploid as Agent from that Prince to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> and he going out in four Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with <HI>Burston</HI> made it upon the disunion of the the Body of the Estate into parcels, a Limb of his patrimony; and remained so, until our Fathers remembrance, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Moil</HI> of <HI>Buckwell,</HI> and was not many years since conveyed by <HI>Robert Moile</HI> Esquire, alienated by Sale to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Winchelsey,</HI> Father to <HI>Heneage Finch</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchelsey</HI> now Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Raymonds</HI> is the last place of Account in <HI>Wye,</HI> which afforded a Seat, and gave a Sirname to a Family so called, and were eminent in this Parish many hundred years since, as being Stewards to the Abby of Battle for Lands near this place, and it is probable this place was the original Seminary or Fountain from whence the <HI>Raimonds</HI> of <HI>Essex, Norfolk,</HI> and other Counties in this Nation, deduced their primitive Ex∣traction: But to advance in my discourse: this Family of <HI>Raymond</HI> having long since abandoned the Signory of this place, it hath been for sundry Descents the Inheritance of <HI>Beck,</HI> and is still entituled to the propriety of one of this Name and Family.</P>

It was made eminent by being parcel of the Inheritance of the Earls of <HI>Gloucester</HI> whose Sirname was <HI>de Clare,</HI> un∣der whose Signory it remained till <HI>Gilbert de Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Hertford,</HI> who deceased in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and left <HI>Margaret de Clare</HI> his sole Heir, who was married to <HI>Hugh de Audley,</HI> who became, in right of his Wife, Lord of the propriety of <HI>Yalding,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Gloucester</HI> likewise; but enjoyed neither no con∣siderable space of Time; for he died in the twenty first year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and left no Issue Male: so that <HI>Margaret Audley</HI> became his Heir, who by matching with <HI>Rafe</HI> Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> cast it into his patrimony; and he at his Death, which was in the forty sixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third in her right was found to be possest of it; and in this Family did the Inheritance fix it self till the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then <HI>Edward Stafford</HI> Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> descended in a direct line from the above∣said <HI>Rafe Stafford,</HI> having by his own improvidence and miscarriage laid himself open to the Malitious Assaults of Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> He by blowing of wild Conjectures into the Ears of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, blew up the fire of his rage into that height and fury, that nothing could extinguish it but the Blood of this Peer poured out by an untimely Effusion upon the Scaffold: upon whose infortunate Decease his Estate by Forfeiture and Escheat devolved to the Crown. And K. <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth suddenly after granted <HI>Yalding</HI> to his Kinsman <HI>Hen. Somerset</HI> E. of <HI>Worcester,</HI> whose Father <HI>Charles Somerset</HI> he in the seventh year of his Government by a new Creation had adorned with that Title; from whom not long after it was by purchase incorporated into the Patrimony of <HI>Nevill</HI> Baron of <HI>Aburgavenny,</HI> whose Successor is <HI>John Nevill</HI> both in the Barony, and in the Inheritance of <HI>Yalding.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Woodfold</HI> is a place not to be declined without some Consideration; because it was a place formerly of no contemptible repute: for <HI>Anselmus de Quintin,</HI> originally issued out from the ancient Family of <HI>Boupton</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire</HI> held it in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, by the fourth part of a Knights Feee, (as the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> testifies) at the making the Black Prince Knight; and here after the Possession divers years had resi∣ded, it shrunk away from this Family, and by purchase was carried into the Inheritance of <HI>Burton,</HI> where likewise it was some Generations settled, till the same Vicissitude, made it as inconstant here, as it had been to the former Family, and by Sale transported the right of it to <HI>Vane,</HI> a younger Branch of <HI>Vane</HI> Earl of <HI>Westmerland,</HI> in whose Name and Posterity the Patrimonial Interest of it continues still wrapt up.</P>
<P><HI>Lodingford</HI> is another mannor in <HI>Yalding,</HI> which belonged to the priory of <HI>Bermond∣sey,</HI> and upon the Suppression of that magnificent Cloister, was annexed to the revenue of the Crown, but made no long abode there: for <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted it to <HI>Tho.

<HEAD>The Description of the ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ELmeley</HI> is an Island not farre removed from <HI>Feversham,</HI> but yet is situated in the Hundred of <HI>Milton,</HI> it was in elder Times parcel of the Demeasn of <HI>Peyforer. Fulk de Peyforer</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, from whom it was transported by Descent to his Son <HI>Fulk de Peyforer,</HI> who like∣wise was in possession of it at his Decease, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second: but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Name and Family was shrunk into a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Julian,</HI> who by matching with <HI>Thomas St. Leger,</HI> annexed that Interess that Family had in this Island to his Inheritance, and from him the like Vicissitude carried it off to <HI>Hen. Aucher,</HI> who had espoused <HI>Joan</HI> his Coheir; but before the latter end of <HI>Hen.</HI> the fifth his right in <HI>Elmeley</HI> was by Sale transplanted into <HI>Cromer</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who likewise before had purchased some proportion of Estate which the Heirs of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Rob. Knolles</HI> Feoffee in Trust for <HI>Grey,</HI> and <HI>Talbot</HI> passed a∣way 1000 Acres in <HI>Elmeley</HI> to Sir <HI>Will. Cromer</HI> 7. <HI>Hen.</HI> 4.</NOTE> <HI>Hastings</HI> had in this Island by a right deduced from <HI>Mayney;</HI> for Sir <HI>VValter de Mayney</HI> Knight of the Garter, died the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and left onely a Sole Daughter and Heir called <HI>Anno,</HI> who by matching with <HI>John Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> brought <HI>Tunstall</HI> and much other Land here in <HI>Elme∣ley</HI> and elsewhere, to be the patrimony of that Family: But to proceed: <HI>Elmeley</HI> being thus entirely made the Demeasn of <HI>Cromer,</HI> continued linked, to this Family many Descents, until Sir <HI>James Cromer</HI> the last of this Name almost in our memory died and left three Daughters and Coheirs surviving (for <HI>Martha</HI> the fourth died unmarried) to share his Estate. <HI>Frances</HI> was matched to Sir <HI>Mathew Carew, Elizabeth</HI> married Sir <HI>John Steed,</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> espoused Sir <HI>John Hales;</HI> and so these three dividing <HI>Elmeley▪</HI> the Descendants which claimed from <HI>Carew</HI> and <HI>Steed,</HI> have very lately by Sale conveyed theirs, and so by Consequence the Sole Interest of this Island unto Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> of <HI>Tunstal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Graine</HI> Island lies in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> and had still the same Owners with the Mannor of <HI>Malmains</HI> in <HI>Stoke</HI> not farre distant. <HI>Nicholas Malmains</HI> held it at his Death which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and from him did the Title stream in this Family until the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it went away by Sale to <HI>Iden</HI> of <HI>Ripley Court</HI> in <HI>Westwell,</HI> and in this Family did the Possession dwell, untill the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was alienated to <HI>John Parks</HI> Gentleman, and he not long after dying without Issue Male, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his Sole In∣heritrix, who was wedded to <HI>John Roper</HI> of <HI>Bedmaneore</HI> in <HI>Lingsted</HI> Esquire united it to his Patrimony, and from him is it now descended to his Successor <HI>Christopher Roper</HI> the instant Baron of <HI>Tenham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hartie</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Feversham,</HI> and did anciently acknowledge the Do∣minion of the Abbot and Covent of <HI>Feversham,</HI> until <HI>John,</HI> Abbot of that place in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth obtained a Licence from the Crown to alienate it to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> Esquire; but here its abode was of no long Moment; for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth it was transmitted by Sale to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> whose Son the Lord <HI>Henry Cheyney</HI> about the middle of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> passed it away to <HI>Samuel Thornhill</HI> Esquire great Grand-father to Mr. ....... <HI>Thornhill,</HI> the instant Owner of it.</P>
<P><HI>Oxney</HI> Island is an Hundred within it self. The first place of eminence which offers it self to a Survey, is <HI>Witresham,</HI> which anciently belonged to the Monks of <HI>Christ∣church,</HI> and was given to that Cloister, in the year 132, by <HI>Edsin</HI> Bishop of St. <HI>Martins</HI> without <HI>Cant.</HI> but upon the Suppression of that Covent in the reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, this Mannor with all its appendant was Immunities granted to <HI>Hen. Crispe</HI> Esq; whose Son <HI>Nicholas Crispe,</HI> held it the sixth of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> and after him <HI>James Hales</HI> Esquire: and he in the thirteenth of that Princess alienated it to <HI>Freak,</HI> in which Family it re∣mained
<PB N="377" REF="197"/>untill the Beginning of King <HI>James;</HI> and then it was conveyed by Sir <HI>Thomas Freak,</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Bishop,</HI> and he in the sixteenth year of the abovesaid Prince, gave it in marriage with his Daughter Mrs. <HI>Jane Bishop,</HI> to <HI>Edward Alford</HI> Esquire; and she in right of that original Settlement does now hold this Mannor.</P>
<P><HI>Palstre</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Witresham,</HI> which represents to us the memory of <HI>John de Palstre,</HI> who was anciently Lord of the Fee: but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was vanished; and then the <HI>Charles's,</HI> a Family of generous rank at <HI>Addington</HI> were setled in the possession, and <HI>Richard Charles</HI> held it, in the fifth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, and so did <HI>Nicholas Charles,</HI> who dyed possest of it in the ele∣venth year of that Prince, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 16. And from this Family by <HI>Alice</HI> one of the Coheirs, it devolved to <HI>William Snath,</HI> and he concluding in a Daughter and Heir, she by matching with <HI>Watton,</HI> brought it to be united to the patrimony of this Family. And here it made its Re dence untill the reign of <HI>Heury</HI> the sixth; and then it was passed away to <HI>Robert Rudston</HI> Esquire, who being embarked in the reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in the Design of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> although he did not forfeit his Life, yet he did that of his Estate, which by the special Indulgence of that Princesse, was granted back to him, in the second year of her reign, in which this was involved, which remained with this Family untill allmost our Time; and then it was passed a∣way to Sir <HI>Edward Henden,</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who dying not long since without Issue, gave it to his Nephew Sir <HI>John Henden,</HI> Father to <HI>Edw. Henden</HI> Esq; the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Owlye</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Witresham,</HI> which anciently was written <HI>Ovely,</HI> as having owners of that Sirname, who stayed not here untill the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, but were extinguished, and left the possession to <HI>Ao Odiarne,</HI> a Family ancient∣ly of good Note. After whom I cannot (because the private Evidences are embezel'd) discover what Families were successively planted in the possession. Only I find it about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the possession of <HI>Mayney</HI> of <HI>Biddenden,</HI> in whom the Interest continued, untill some few years since it was alienated by Sir <HI>John Mayney</HI> of <HI>Linton</HI> Knight and Baronet, to <HI>Peter Ricaut</HI> Esquire, who hath lately alie∣nated his right in it to Mr. <HI>Menell</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ebeney</HI> was given to the Monks of <HI>Christchurch</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by K. <HI>Athulfus,</HI> at the particular entreaty and instigation of <HI>Ceolnoth</HI> the Arch-bishop, in the year 832, to the Reparation of their Cloister and Cathedral. The words registred in the Latine Record are these, <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 832, <HI>Rex Athulfus instinctu Ceolnothi Archiepiscopi dedit Ebeneyam ad opus Monachorum, Libere sicut Adisham.</HI> But when the Im∣pieties of the Monks, who had cloistered up Religion it self in a Lazy Cell, grew so clamorous, that they called for Vengeance upon their Seminaties, that Storm arose in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which by the Dissolution of their Covents, expiated their Irregularities; this Mannor was surrendered to the Crown, and the abovesaid Prince, in the thirty second year of his Government, granted it to Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Serjeant at Law, who dying without Issue-male, his three Daughters, namely <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> married to <HI>William Waller</HI> Esquire, <HI>Hellen</HI> first wedded to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedge∣bury</HI> Esquire; secondly to Sir <HI>George Somerset;</HI> and thirdly to <HI>Thomas Vane</HI> of <HI>Burston</HI> Esquire; and <HI>Anne</HI> matched to <HI>Richard Covert</HI> of <HI>Slaugham,</HI> as his Coheirs entered upon his Inheritance, and then this place upon the Division of his estate, increased the Demeasn of <HI>Richard Covert</HI> Esquire, from whom by the Devolution of a descendant right, the title is now lodged in his Successor Mr...... <HI>Covert.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VVoodrove</HI> in <HI>Ebeney,</HI> acknowledged in elder Ages a Family for proprietaries, known by the Name of <HI>Mocking,</HI> who had a revenue likewise about <HI>Milton, Stockbury, Hartlip</HI> and <HI>Shepey,</HI> of no despicable Bulk. <HI>John Mocking</HI> Son of <HI>VVilliam Mocking</HI> flourished under the Scepter of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Edward</HI> the second, and held this Mannor at his Decease, which was in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 75. And in this Family did the possession fix, untill the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it began to ebbe away from this Name, and flow by the conveyance of Sale into <HI>Guldford:</HI> and in a very old Schedule which enumerates the Mannors, which related to <HI>John Guldford,</HI> who lived under the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth and <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, this is registred in the Catalogue; and from him did it come down to Sir <HI>Edward Guldford,</HI> whose Daughter and Heir <HI>Joan,</HI> brought it to be the
<PB N="379" REF="197"/>patrimony of <HI>John Dudley</HI> Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and he gave this Mannor with no small demeasn at <HI>Halden,</HI> in Dower with <HI>Mary</HI> his Daughter, matched to Sir <HI>Hen. Sidney</HI> Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Knight of the Garter, a person of that Value and Eminence, that he that would discover him represented in his best Features and proportion must view him in his Worthy and Signal undertakings in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he will find him better pourtraid, than he can be by any faint or drowsie Attributes, that drop from my humble and unequal pen; and from him did this Mannor in right of this Alliance, descend to his Grandchild the right honorable <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Lei∣cester,</HI> who not many years since passed it away to Sir <HI>Edward Hendon,</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer, who upon his Decease gave it to his Nephew Sir <HI>John Hondon</HI> of <HI>Biddenden,</HI> and he not long since alienated it to Mr. <HI>John Austin</HI> of <HI>Tenter∣den;</HI> from whom it is lately devolved by Death, to be now the possession of his second Brother Mr. <HI>Rob. Austin</HI> of <HI>Hall-place</HI> in <HI>Bexley.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brocket</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Ebeney</HI> which had possessors as appears by ancient Deeds of that Name, who likewise were written in Evidences <HI>Brocket;</HI> but whether the <HI>Brockets</HI> of <HI>Brocket-hall</HI> in the County of <HI>Hartford,</HI> were descended from these, or these from them, I cannot discover: But the greatest honor which this obscure Mannor hath acquired, is, that ever since the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, untill the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it acknowledged the noble Family of <HI>Guldford;</HI> and then it changed its proprietaries: for that year it was by <HI>John Guldford</HI> Esquire, conveyed to Sir <HI>John Hales</HI> Baton of the Exchequer, from whom it is now come down to own the proprietary of his Descendant, Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> of <HI>Tunstall</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Shepey,</HI> comes next to be treated of: It called by <HI>Ptolomie Toliatis,</HI> in Latin <HI>Insula Ovium,</HI> in Saxon <HI>Sceapige,</HI> all agreeing in their Verdict, that it was so named from its plenty of Sheep. It is environed with the mixed Waters of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and <HI>Medway</HI> on the West, the <HI>Swale</HI> or <HI>Genlade</HI> on the South, and the Main Ocean beats on the East and North; more celebrated for the fertility of the Soil, then Salurbity of Air which is grosse and thick, causing Aguish Infirmities, that keep long Residence, they get possession,</P>
<P><HI>Quinborough,</HI> or rather originally <HI>Kingsborough,</HI> as <HI>Konisbergh</HI> in <HI>Prussia,</HI> is now cor∣ruptly called <HI>Quensborough,</HI> acknowledged King <HI>Edward</HI> the third for the Founder, who (having wedded <HI>Philippa</HI> Daughter of <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Henault</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and his oc∣casions often calling him to passe into her Fathers Dominion, whose Aid and Assistance he required in the great enterprise, for the Recovery of his undoubted right to the Diadem of <HI>France</HI>) heerected this strong and stately Fottresse for defence of the mouth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and his own secure Accomodation. And because the Situation of this place was unhealthy, he (to allure Inhabitants) in the year 1366, enobled the Town with a Charter of Incorporation, wherein he indulges by Grant ample priviledges and Immunities unto it, as namely to hold two Mercates weekly, one on the Munday and the other on the Thursday; and two Fairs yearly, one at the Feast of St. <HI>James,</HI> the other on the twenty fourth of <HI>March,</HI> and to make Choice of Burgesses to send to Parlia∣ment. The principal Architect and Surveyout of the work, was <HI>William Wickham,</HI> after Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who had been formerly employed in that kind, at the re∣edifying <HI>Windsor-castle,</HI> when his good patron <HI>John de Vuedal,</HI> was Constable there. This man used to inscribe on the edifices thus erected, this Inscription, This made <HI>VVickham,</HI> whereby some conceived, he arrogated to himself the Cost and payment of the Structure, and informed the King thereof: but his ingenious exposition satisfied that Prince, when he shewed him that by his Inspection and Insight into those matters, he had obtained both his Ecclesiastical and secular promotions, being made Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> first Keeper of the privy Seal, and then of the King's Conscience, his last Gradation or Ascent being to be Lord Chancellor of <HI>England.</HI> When King <HI>Edward</HI> had perfected this Castle, he instituted a Chief Governour, who was for the future, to carry the Title of Constable, like as at <HI>Dover-castle,</HI> and elsewhere. The Catalogue of those who succeeded in that Command, I have set down. The care and cost of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the year 1536 to repair this place, when he erected Fortresses for Defence of the Sea Coast, drew this Eulogie from the Pen of <HI>Leland,</HI>

<P><HI>Minster</HI> is the next place of Account in this Island, and is contracted from the Latin Word <HI>Monasterium,</HI> from whence this Town hath its Appellation, and may chal∣lenge the third place amongst our <HI>English</HI> Nunneries. For <HI>Sexburga</HI> Daughter to <HI>Ercombert</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> (to whom and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the Church of this Parish is devoted and dedicated) in the year 664, erected a Religious House at this place, and liberally endowed it, for the Sustentation of vayled Virgins. The second was founded by <HI>Eanswith</HI> Daughter of <HI>Eadbald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> at <HI>Folkston.</HI> And the first had its Institution at <HI>Liminge,</HI> likewise in this County, by <HI>Eadburga,</HI> and erected to the Honor of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Mildred.</HI> But the Antiquity of this Cell, and the Sanctity attributed to it by elder times, could not so skreen or rescue it from the Heat of War, but it was thrice sacked and dismantled by the barbarous irruptions of the <HI>Danes,</HI> within lesse then an Age, which by usual Account is said to be thirty year. The first mis∣fortune happened to it in the year 832, when thirty five Sail of them rived here and rifled it. The second and third time, was in the year 851 and then again in the year 855, by the Armies of them who wintered their Ships within this Island. Besides these depredations the complices of Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> and his Sons, in the Time of their proscription and exile, which was in the year 1052, landed in this Island, and mi∣serably harrassed it, by filling all places with Ruine and Devastation. Indeed Reli∣gion when it glitters with a splendid and full revenue, is like the Pictures of the an∣cient Saints, apparelled in rich Garments, which some have been enticed to rob, not out of ill Will to their Sanctity, but love to their Shrines, and Beauty of their Cloaths; Persecution and the Robes of Humility were the Attire of the primitive Church, and when she is dressed up in gaudy Fortunes, it is no more then she merits: Yet sometimes it occasions the Devil, to cheat her of her Holinesse; and impious men by an unjust and injurious Sacriledge, to cheat her of her riches. But I have digressed: I now return into the Track of my Discourse, and must inform my Reader, that although the Glory of this Cloister, was so bowed down and broken with these misfortunes, that it appeared almost sunk in its own Calamities: yet by the piety of subsequent Ages, it was buoyed up again: but more especially by the indulgent Charity of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, who in the first year of his reign confirmed their old priviledges, and to those added by patent many new. And in this Condition it
<PB N="381" REF="198"/>continued untill the general Dissolution or Deluge, and then it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign granted to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney:</HI> and his Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> having in the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> exchanged it for other Lands with that Princesse; she regranted it to Sir <HI>Edward Hobby,</HI> who had matched with her Kinswoman <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Hunsdon,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>Edward Hobby,</HI> about the middle of King <HI>James</HI> passed it away to Mr. <HI>Hen. Richards,</HI> and he upon his Decease bequeathed it to <HI>Gabriel Livesey</HI> Esquire; and he, almost in our Remembrance, conveyed it to Sir <HI>John Heyward,</HI> who setled it upon his two Feoffees in Trust, Sir <HI>Francis Buller</HI> of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and Serjeant <HI>Clerk</HI> of <HI>Roche∣ster,</HI> for such Charitable Uses, as they should think proportionate to that Convey∣ance,</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Northwood,</HI> is situated in this Parish, which was the Inheritance of <HI>Jordanus de Scapeia,</HI> for so he is written in old datelesse Deeds, and he had Issue <HI>Stephen de Northwood,</HI> who was the first whom I find in Record, to have assumed this Appellation, and he was Father to Sir <HI>Roger de Northwood,</HI> who lies buryed in <HI>Minster</HI> Church, with an Inscription affixed to his Monument, which seems by its more mo∣dern Character, to have been corrupted; It is this: <HI>Hic jacet Rogerus Northwood, Miles, sepultus ante Conquestum.</HI> Indeed his Figure is fairly insculped in Brasse, with that of his Lady <HI>Bona</HI> lying by him, who was Sister and Heir of <HI>William de Wauton.</HI> The vulgar upon a credulous errour every where affirm, that all those who are thus buryed, were enterr'd after the Conquest; when it is certain that many were entom∣bed in this posture, many years before the Conquerour, that had obliged themselves by Vow, to defend the Crosse and Sepulcher of our Saviour, against the Fury and Assaults of Infidels. Sure I am, the Tomb next to this appears to be far more ancient, and of so venerable a Form, that its like doth not occurre in any other place; there is not any Letter of Inscription left, only the Coat is a sure Testimony, that it was one of the Ancestors of the Family of <HI>Northwood.</HI> But to proceed: <HI>John Norwood</HI> one of this House, as the private Records of the Family testifie, feasted <HI>H.</HI> the fifth, at the <HI>Red Lion</HI> in <HI>Sedingbourne,</HI> and the Wine amounted upon the wole account but to 9. s. and 9. d. Wine being then rated but at a penny the pint. <HI>W. Northwood</HI> another of this Name, and Family, did signal Service at the Battel of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> and afterwards at the Battel of <HI>Vernoile,</HI> which was managed by <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> Regent of <HI>France.</HI> He was Kinsman of <HI>John Northwood,</HI> who was the last of this Name at this place; for he a∣bout the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, alienated it to <HI>VVilliam VVarner</HI> Esquire; whose Son and Heir <HI>VVilliam VVarner,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, de∣mised it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> having exchanged it for other Lands with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it remained with the Crown, untill King <HI>James</HI> in the second year of his reign, granted it to the right honorable <HI>Philip Herbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and afterwards Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Newhall</HI> is another little Mannor in <HI>Minster,</HI> which <HI>Fulke Peyforer</HI> dyed seised of, in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; and from him it devolved by descent to be the pa∣trimony of his great Grandchild <HI>Fulk Peyforer,</HI> and his Sole Heir <HI>Julian</HI> carried it a∣way to <HI>Thomas St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Ottringden,</HI> whose two Female Coheirs being matched to <HI>Aucher</HI> and <HI>Ewias,</HI> shared his Inheritance, and about the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, passed it away by Sale to <HI>Cromer,</HI> whose Successor <HI>VVilliam Cromer,</HI> having about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by some misdemeanor, forfeited it to the Crown, it was granted to one <HI>Stephen Graine,</HI> in which Family it remained untill the Begin∣ning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Small;</HI> from which Name, the same Vicissitude not many years since carried it off to <HI>Luck;</HI> who transmitted his Right in it to Mr. <HI>Henry Newton,</HI> who hath lately demised it to Mr. <HI>Josias Gering</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rishingdon</HI> is the last place of Account, which is circumscribed within the Limits of <HI>Minster.</HI> It was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, wrapped up in the patrimony of <HI>Savage:</HI> for at that time <HI>John de Savage</HI> obtained a Charter of Free∣warrren, to several of his Mannors in <HI>Kont,</HI> in the Number of which this is registered for one; but in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the possession was departed from this Family, being purchased by <HI>Philippa</HI> Wife and Queen to <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and setled upon the Hospital of St. <HI>Katharines</HI> neere the <HI>Tower,</HI> in whose demeasn it hath layn
<PB N="382" REF="199"/>involved ever since. In the fourteenth year of the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the King's Uncle, was Lessee to that Hospital, as ap∣pears <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 113. Which I mention to discover to the Reader, that even in those Times, Persons of the greatest eminence did not disdain to be Tenants for an Estate to an Hospital.</P>
<P><HI>East-Church</HI> is the next place which comes to be considered: Which though ob∣scure in it self, yet is made eminent by <HI>Shurland,</HI> which is a Limb of this Parish, and anciently did own a noble Family which bore that Sirname; the last of which was Sir <HI>Robert de Shurland,</HI> who was one of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Bannerets, which were made by King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and to whom the former Prince, as a farther Symbol or Testimony of his Merit, granted a Charter of Free-warren in the twenty ninth year of his reign, to his Mannor of <HI>Shurland:</HI> not long after which he deceased, and lies entombed under an Arch in the Southwall, with his pourtraicture insculped in a Marble, in <HI>Minster</HI> Church, whose Tomb is become the Scene of much Falshood and popular errour; the vulgar having digged out of his Vault, many wild Legends and Roman∣ces, as namely that he buryed a Priest alive, that he swam on his horse two miles thorough the Sea, to the King, who was then neer this Island on Shipboard, to pur∣chase his pardon; and having obtained it, swam back to the Shore: where being arrived, he cut off the head of his said Horse, because it was affirmed, he had acted this by Magick: and that riding on hunting a twelvemoneth after, his horse stumbled and threw him on the Scull of his former Horse, which blow so bruised him, that from that Contusion he contracted an inward impostumation, of which he dyed; and in memory of which, an Horse Head is placed at his Feet; which fictitious Story, is rent into the disunion of so many absurd circumstances, that I shall represent to the Reader, the Founda∣tion on which this fabulous Natrative was formerly established, which is no more but this. Sir <HI>Robert de Shurland</HI> above-mentioned, being Lord Warden of the Cinque∣ports, and a man of eminent Authority under <HI>Edward</HI> the first, obtained Grant of pri∣viledge by Charter, to have wrack of Sea upon his Lands confining on the Sea Shore, neere <HI>Shurland:</HI> now the extent of this Royaltie is evermore esteemed to reach as far into the Water, upon a low ebb, as a man can ride in, and touch any thing with the point of his Launce, and so you have the explication of this marvel; and the cou∣ching either of whole Creatures, or part of them, at the Feet of worthy personages, is most frequent both now and in elder Times, that these inanimate Representations might be the Symbols or Hieroglyphicks, to intimate to posterity those Virtues which were resident in them when alive. But to proceed: the abovementioned Sir <HI>Robert de Shurland,</HI> having improved his Reputation with many noble and worthy Actions, left That only to perpetuate his Name to posterity, having no Issue-male to continue it: for he left only one Daughter and Heir, matched to <HI>W. de Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Patricksbourn Cheyney,</HI> who was son and heir to Sir <HI>Alexander de Cheyney,</HI> who is in the Inventory or List of those Knights Bannerets, who were ennobled with that Dignity, by <HI>E.</HI> the first, at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and in Right of this Match, dyed possest of it, in the eighth year of <HI>E.</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 58. And from him did it come down to his great Grandchild, Sir <HI>John Cheyney</HI> who was Knight of the Garter, and frequently Knight of this Shire, in sundry Parliaments, under the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in the first year of whose reign, as our Chronicles inform us, he was sent Embassador to several forreign Princes, to represent to them the Reasons or Motives which induced him to assume the <HI>English</HI> Diadem, and in the first and second year of that Prince, he was chosen Speaker of Parliament. Sir <HI>William Cheyney</HI> another of this Family of <HI>Shurland,</HI> was first a Judge, and secondly Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth: but the greatest Honour this Mannor atchieved, was when it came to be possest by Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney</HI> who was Knight of the Garter, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, Constable of <HI>Quinborough</HI> Castle, and one of the Privy Councel to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and he had Issue Sir <HI>Henry Cheyney,</HI> created <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Tuddington</HI> by Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> who having exchanged this Mannor of <HI>Shurland</HI> with that Princesse, it remai∣ned with the patrimony of the Crown, untill the second year of King <HI>James;</HI> and then it was by royal Concession from that Prince, made the Inheritance of <HI>Philip</HI> Earl
<PB N="383" REF="199"/>of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and after of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> upon whose late decease it is now come to con∣fesse the Signory of his second Son Mr. <HI>James Herbert.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kingsborough</HI> is another Mannor in this Parish, whose Name tacitly intimates to us, that it was involved formerly in the Revenue of the Crown, and was the place which the Inhabitants frequented, not only for the holding of a Court, for the choice and election of the Constables of the Island: but likewise here assembled to nomi∣nate and appoint those Wardens or Bailiffs, that were to take Cognisance or Charge of the passage called <HI>King ferry;</HI> which divides the Island, and the main Land of me County; this Mannor after it had for many Generations layn folded up in the royal Demeasne, was by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> granted to Mr. <HI>Henry Cary;</HI> who about the Be∣ginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> passed it away to <HI>Swaleman,</HI> whose Descendant is still entituled to the propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Leisdon</HI> next offers it selfe up to our view, which was parcel of that estate which acknowledged the noble and ancient Family of <HI>Grey</HI> or <HI>Rotherfield</HI> in <HI>Sussex</HI> for its an∣cient Owners, The first which made this Family eminent was <HI>John de Grey,</HI> who was frequently summoned to sit in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and dyed possest of this Mannor in the thirty third year of that Prince, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 38. And so did <HI>Robert Grey</HI> his Successor, in the second year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth. After his <HI>Exit,</HI> I do not find it long constant to the Signory of this Name: for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth it was alienated to <HI>Lovell;</HI> and by virtue of this pur∣chase, Sir <HI>William Lovell</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. After this Family had abandoned the possession, the <HI>Cheyneys</HI> of <HI>Shurland</HI> were by purchase planted in the Inheritance, and remained setled in the Fee-simple of it, untill Sir <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> exchanged it with Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nuts</HI> called so vulgarly, but in the ancient Court-rolls named <HI>Notts,</HI> as being the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Nott,</HI> is a little Mannor in <HI>Leisdon,</HI> which after it had for many descents acknowledged no other proprietaries, but this Family, about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, was rent from them by purchase, and transplanted into <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> a Family which were Owners anciently of much Land about <HI>Ling∣sted, Throuley,</HI> and other places in that Track, and continued Masters of this Lordship, untill the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was conveyed to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney;</HI> whose Son Sir <HI>Henry Cheyney</HI> about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> passed it away to <HI>Sampson,</HI> a Family which had been possessors of <HI>Sampson-court,</HI> not far distant many hundred years; and were descended from <HI>William Sampson,</HI> who was frequently sum∣moned to sit in Parliament as Baron in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the first. From <HI>Sampson</HI> it was again in our Fathers Memory carried off to <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>borne,</HI> in the Descendants of which Family the right is still fixed.</P>
<P><HI>Werdon</HI> is the last place of Account in this Island; It was in times of an elder In∣scription involved in the Inheritance of <HI>Savage</HI> of <HI>Bobbing,</HI> and in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, Sir <HI>John de Savage</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Werdon:</HI> But before the middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family had surrendered their Interest here to <HI>Fremingham;</HI> for <HI>John de Fremingham</HI> dyed seised of it, in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: but whether it devolved with other Land by the Heir general of <HI>Fremingham</HI> to <HI>Isley</HI> or not, is incertain, because those privtae evidences which relate to this Mannor, extend no higher then the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; and then I find the propriety of it in <HI>Norton,</HI> in which Family after the pos∣session had resided untill our times, it was conveyed to <HI>Edmund Tooke</HI> of <HI>Dartford</HI> Esq; Barrister at Law, now proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Thanet</HI> lies, if not all, yet most part of it, circumscribed within the Hundred of <HI>Ringleslow:</HI> It is styled in Greek by ancient Authors <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in Latine <HI>Thanetum,</HI> and in the Saxon it is curtailed into <HI>Thanet,</HI> which an old Manuscript which I have seen, de∣duces from two Saxon Words <HI>Thane</HI> and <HI>Yete,</HI> which in that Language then implyed as much as the Lords-Entrance: but for my particular, I believe that the Saxons, when upon the Donation of it to them by <HI>Vortiger,</HI> they first entered into this Island, fin∣ding that <HI>Thanetum</HI> was a Latine Name imposed upon it by the Romans, who had but newly then deserted the Protection of this Island, new-softned the Name by contra∣cting
<PB N="384" REF="200"/>it, and then quilted it into the Alphabet of their own Language, and called it <HI>Thanett;</HI> and that this is probable, I shall evince from circumstances, <HI>Punio</HI> in La∣tine signifies to punish, from whence the <HI>Saxons</HI> styled that place by <HI>Maidstone,</HI> where they punished Malefactors <HI>Pinandun Hoath:</HI> So <HI>Castrum</HI> was a Name used by the Ro∣mans to signifie or expresse any Castle or Fortresse, which the <HI>Saxons</HI> upon their ad∣mission into this Island, finding it to be imposed upon all places of strength and im∣portance, adopted it into their Dialect, and from the word <HI>Castrum</HI> extracted the word <HI>Ceaster.</HI> I could instance in many other particulars, but that I should both weary my Reader, and clog this Discourse with Superfluities: I shall therefore from the untwi∣sting the Name, descend to the Description of the Island.</P>
<P><HI>Serre,</HI> now vulgarly called <HI>Sarre,</HI> is the first place of Note which offers it self up to a view: It was anciently a Parish, untill peradventure the unhealthinesse of the Soile; for it now confines upon Marishes (where formerly glided that Gullet of Sea-water, now wholly stifled with Sand) which made <HI>Thanett</HI> an Island, as may plainly appear by an ancient Mapp, printed by the original, and now extant in the Book called <HI>Monasti∣cum Anglicanum</HI>) or else from the insalubrity of the Air, which being polluted with those black and foggie vapours which ascend from a loose and soggie earth, very fre∣quently leave a venomous Tincture upon the Blood and Spirits of those Inhabitants, who are subject to the impression of such pernicious exhalations, forced those who dwelt in <HI>Serre,</HI> to abandon so sickly a Habitation; and so the Parish by degrees, began to languish away into that Solitude, we see it is shrunk into at present. The Church was dedicated to St. <HI>Giles,</HI> but at present lies entombed in such forgotten Ruines, that scarce the least Remains are visible. The Mannor it self was one of the ancient Seats of the noble Family of <HI>Crioll. Bertram de Crioll</HI> augments the Register of those <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, who were with <HI>Richard</HI> the first at the Siege of <HI>Acon</HI> in <HI>Palestine. Bartho∣lomew de Crioll</HI> another of this Name and Family, was Lieutenant of <HI>Dover-castle</HI> under the abovesaid Prince. <HI>Simon de Crioll</HI> was with <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at his prosperous Siege of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> and for his generous Assistance there, received the Order of Knight∣hood, and from him it came down to Sir <HI>William Crioll,</HI> Father to Sir <HI>John Crioll</HI> who held it in the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 9. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>Par. prim. Memb.</HI> 19. And from him was it transmitted to his Son Sir <HI>Thomas Keriell,</HI> Knight of the Garter, a Man of that worth and eminence, in that time he lived in, that I might seem something to obscure his Glory, if I should not represent to the Reader, some of those honorable Atchievements, which he performed in <HI>France,</HI> the Relation of which I have omitted in my Description of <HI>Stockbury</HI> and <HI>Walmer.</HI> In the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, he being Governour of <HI>Gourney</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> issuedout of that place, and harassed not only that Province, but fought with the Earl of <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> who was sent to oppose his Eruptions, and after a sharp Combat gave him a remark∣able discomfiture, killing about six hundred, and captivating two hundred Soldiers. In the fifteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, he seised upon the Duke of <HI>Burgundie's</HI> Carriages and Cannons leaving <HI>Cretoy</HI> (a Fortresse then in possession of the <HI>English,</HI> and not long before distressed by the abovesaid Duke) furnished with victual for six hundred men, for the space of a twelvemonth. And lastly in the twenty seventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, he was sent over into <HI>France,</HI> with a supply of 1500 men to recruit the <HI>English</HI> Army, where he did as much with so small a quantity of men, as could be expected from humane Courage, and having reduced some pieces of strength, he encountered the Earl of <HI>Clermont</HI> at a place called <HI>Formigney,</HI> where being overlaid with Multitude, after he had given most signal Testimony of his valour, and discharged all those duties which might have secured and preserved the Honor of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, and the Glory of the day, by which he declared himself to be not only a prudent Man, but an expert Commander, he was defeated: But to proceed, after the Family of <HI>Crioll</HI> went out from the possession of this place, which was before the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>John White</HI> Esquire, became Lord of the Fee, and held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth: but after his Decease it was not long re∣sident in this Name: for in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, I find it the Inheritance of <HI>Bere,</HI> and was fixed in this Family, untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was passed away by Sale to <HI>Rush,</HI> ancestor to Sir <HI>Fran∣cis Rush,</HI> who not many years since concluding in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of
<PB N="385" REF="200"/>them by matching with Sir <HI>George Wentworth</HI> of <HI>Wentworth Woodhouse</HI> in <HI>York-shire,</HI> third Brother to Sir <HI>Thomas Wentworth,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Stafford,</HI> hath made it his instant patrimony.</P>
<P><HI>Downebarton</HI> is the next place which occurs, and challenges our Survey. There was a Family Sirnamed <HI>Exeter,</HI> that had large possessions at or neer this place, and were planted in the Tenure of them many Centuries of years: In the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Margaret</HI> Widow of <HI>John Exeter,</HI> held Lands at <HI>Downebarton</HI> in Right of Dower, as appears by an Inquisition taken after her death, which commences from that time. But the principal Honor this place anciently recieved, was, that it was a Mannor which fell under the Signory of the Arch-bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as is mani∣fest by an Inquisition taken in the twenty first of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 7. Which represents to posterity what Lands and Mannors <HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> held at that time; nor did it depart from the revenue of this Sea, until the 29. year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then being exchanged with the Crown by <HI>Tho. Cran∣mer</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> it was granted away to <HI>Henry Crispe</HI> Esquire; in which Family it was fixed untill those times which were circumscribed within the Verge of our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Paramour,</HI> from which Name not many years since, the vicissitude of purchase carried it away, and hath now made it part of the demeasn of <HI>Daniel Harvey</HI> of <HI>Combe-nevill,</HI> in <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames</HI> Esquire.</P>
<P><HI>Quekes</HI> in <HI>Birchington</HI> was the ancient Seat of an ancient Family which bore that Sir∣name, and after it had for many descents acknowledged it self to have related to that Name, it devolved by paternal descent to <HI>John Quekes,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>H.</HI> the seventh, expired in a Daughter and Heir who was matched to....<HI>Crispe,</HI> extra∣cted from the <HI>Crispes</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> who had flourished there many Generations before, (as appears by an old pedigree now in the hands of Sir <HI>Nicholas Crispe</HI> of <HI>London</HI>) under the Notion of Gentlemen of the best Rank; nor did this Family wither by being thus transplanted, and inoculated upon a forraign Stem, but rather did gather new Sap and Verdure, which made it so exceedingly sprout forth, that <HI>Henry Crispe</HI> Esquire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the thirty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and was afterwards honoured with Knighthood, did shoot up to that power, and grew so tall in Title, that he was in the dialect of those Times called <HI>Regulus Insulae,</HI> or the Governour of the Isle of <HI>Thannet;</HI> and from this worthy person, is <HI>Henry Crispe</HI> Esquire, Heir to Sir <HI>Henry Crispe</HI> not long since deceased, and now proprietary of <HI>Quekes,</HI> originally de∣scended.</P>
<P><HI>West-gate</HI> in <HI>Birchington</HI> was wrapped up in that vast demeasn which was entituled to the possession of the noble and powerful Family of <HI>Leybourn</HI> of <HI>Leybourn</HI>-castle. <HI>Will. de Leybourn</HI> Son of <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the second, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num.</HI> 56. And left it to <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> from whom with the rest of his diffused patrimony in this County, it came to his only Daughter and Heir <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> first matched to <HI>Iohn de Hastings,</HI> Brother or Kinsman to <HI>Laurence de Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and then to <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Hunting∣don,</HI> but survived them both, and dying without Issue in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, she made God her Heir to this Mannor, and gave it to the Abby of St. <HI>Au∣gustins,</HI> and in the patrimony of that Cloister did the Title of this Mannor lie locked up, untill the general Dissolution in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, unloosened it, and then linked it again by a new Augmentation to the demeasn of the Crown; and then the abovesaid Prince, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <HI>Tho. Moile,</HI> who not long after passed it away to <HI>Bere,</HI> a Family of good account in this Island, as being descended from <HI>Richard de Bere,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae Assisae</HI> for <HI>Kent,</HI> in the second year of King <HI>John,</HI> as appears by the Pipe-roll of that time; and from this Name about the latter end of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> did it by purchase come over to <HI>Denne</HI> of <HI>Denne-hill</HI> in <HI>Kingston,</HI> whose Successor Mr. <HI>Thomas Denne</HI> of <HI>Denne-hill,</HI> Reader formerly of the Middle-Temple, and Recorder of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> dying lately without Issue-male, his four Daughters (<HI>Thomazin</HI> married to Sir <HI>Nicholas Crispe, Bridget</HI> matched to Sir <HI>Iohn Darrell</HI> of <HI>Calehill, Dorothy</HI> wedded to Mr. <HI>Roger Lucan,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> espoused to <HI>Vincent Denne</HI> Esquire) became his Coheirs, and and this upon the division of his Estate, augmented the patrimony of Sir <HI>Nicholas Crispe.</HI></P>
<PB N="386" REF="201"/>
<P><HI>Dandelion</HI> in the Parish of <HI>St. Johns,</HI> was the Seat of a Family in elder times called <HI>Dent de lyon,</HI> as appears by divers ancient Deeds, some without dare, some as high as <HI>Edward</HI> the first: but about the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the Name was mel∣ted down, and made more soft and easie, and transplanted into <HI>Dandelion,</HI> as appears by several Deeds of one <HI>John Dandelion,</HI> which commence from that Kings reign, and the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and he had Issue <HI>John Dandelion,</HI> who about the Begin∣ning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, determined in a Daughter and Heir, matched to <HI>Petit</HI> of <HI>Shalmesford</HI> neer <HI>Chartham,</HI> and lies buryed under a fair Marble in <HI>St. Johns,</HI> with a plate of Brasse (if the Barbarity of these times, have not ravished it away) affixed to it, designing the time of his death, and by a Right fortified and made firme, from this Alliance, does this ancient Seat now acknowledge the Signory of Mr. <HI>Henry Petit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nash-court</HI> in the Parish abovesaid, was anciently the possession of the <HI>Garwintons,</HI> of whom I have spoken at <HI>Bekesbourn,</HI> where was their capital Mansion, and went a∣long with the Interest of this Family, untill <HI>William Garwinton</HI> the last of this Name dying without Issue, in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, bequeathed this and much other Land to <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> who had married <HI>Joan</HI> his nearest Kinswoman and Heir general of the Family; and he left it to his Son <HI>Richard Haut,</HI> who left only one Daughter called <HI>Margery,</HI> who was his Heir, and she by marching with <HI>William Isaack</HI> made it parcel of his Inheritance; and in memory of this Alliance, the Windows of this Mansion, are in several Pannels of Glasse adorned with the Arms of <HI>Haut</HI> and <HI>Isaack,</HI> and near them are placed the Armes of <HI>William Warham</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> empaled with those of his Sea; for of him, and his Predecessors did this Mansion hold. After <HI>Isaack</HI> was gone out, which was about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, the <HI>Lincolnes</HI> by purchase became Lords of the Fee, and held it untill the midst of the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was passed away for some Courtesies obtained by the Heir of this Family, to Sir <HI>Roger Manwood</HI> Chief Baron of the Exchequer; and his Son Sir <HI>Peter Manwood</HI> alienated it in our Fathers Memory to <HI>Cleybrook,</HI> from whom it descended to his Son Mr. <HI>William Cleybrook,</HI> who upon his decease left it to his Widow Mrs. <HI>Sarah Cleybrooks</HI> remarried to Mr. <HI>George Somner</HI> slain at <HI>Wye-bridge,</HI> in the year 1648, and now lastly to Mr. <HI>James Newman,</HI> and after her decease the Re∣version to his Kinsman Mr. <HI>Alexander Northwood</HI> and his Heirs.</P>
<P><HI>Dene</HI> and <HI>Hengrove</HI> are two Mannots circumscribed likewise within the precincts of <HI>St. Johns,</HI> and were involved in the spreading Demeasn of the powerful Family of <HI>Leybourn,</HI> as appears by a solemn Inquisition taken after the decease of <HI>William de Ley∣bourn,</HI> who dyed possest of them in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the second; and from whom they came to his Grandchild, <HI>Juliana</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> who ha∣ving no Issue, in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, either by <HI>John de Hastings,</HI> or <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntingdon,</HI> constiuted the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> her heir to both these places (a more certain Inheritor then any loose Unthrift in the devout estimate of those Times) with this Clause annexed, that the Brotherhood of that Covent, should pray for the Souls of <HI>John de Hastings, Laurence de Hastings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pem∣broke, John de Hastings</HI> his Son, and lastly for that of <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntingdon;</HI> Which grant of hers was confirmed (as appears by <HI>Thorne</HI> the Chronicler of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> lately printed) by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the year 1363, and it is probable that those two Chappels, which the fabulous Tradition of the Island is, were erected at the two abovesaid places, by two Virgins, were built by the beforementioned <HI>Juliana,</HI> for two Chauntry Priests, to celebrate Masse for the Souls of her two deceased Husbands. But to proceed, upon the Suppression of the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, these two Mannors being united to the demeasn of the Crown, the Fee-simple was lodged in the Royal patrimony, untill King <HI>James</HI> in the Beginning of his reign, granted them to Mr. <HI>William Salter,</HI> who demised them to Mr. <HI>Manasser Norwood,</HI> whose Grandchild Mr. <HI>Alexander Norwood,</HI> for ought I know, is yet the proprietary of them.</P>
<P><HI>Salmeston</HI> is the last place of account in <HI>St. Johns,</HI> and did belong, as appears by a <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> cited at large in the late printed Chronicle of <HI>Thorne,</HI> to the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> in the year 1362, and remained treasured up in the Demeasn of that Co∣vent, untill its final Suppression in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then being rent
<PB N="387" REF="201"/>away from the Church, it was by a new settlement enstated again upon the Church, being granted by the abovesaid Prince, in the twenty ninth of his Rule, unto <HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and is at present held in Lease for Life, by the Lady <HI>Mary St. Leger,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>Warham St. Leger,</HI> who had it in Exchange when he passed away the Mannors of <HI>Bersted</HI> and <HI>Leeds</HI> Castle, to Sir <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Hollingbourne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fleet</HI> is a place of Account which is situated partly in the Parish of St. <HI>Johns,</HI> and partly in St. <HI>Peters,</HI> and was the Inheritance, in Ages of a very high Extraction, of a Family who were written in Latine-Records <HI>de Fleta,</HI> and were planted here, as ap∣pears by their datelesse Deeds, about the reign either of King <HI>John,</HI> or <HI>Henry</HI> the third. And when in times of a more modern Inscription, they began to seal with Coats of Armes, appendant to private Muniments and Evidences; I find the parer∣nal Coat of this Family, to have been <HI>Checqueè ....... upon a Canton a Lion Rampant</HI> ....... which still lies registred in all old Ordinaries and Alphabets of Arms, and other ancient Rolls and Records of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentry: but as all Families have their Ebbings and Vicissitudes, so had this. For in our Fathers Memory, one of this Fami∣ly expired in a Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Philipott;</HI> and in our Memory another of this Name concluded in two Females, married to <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Pomflet,</HI> and so the ancient patrimony of <HI>Fleet,</HI> being thus crumbled into parcels, is now divided be∣tween these three Families.</P>
<P><HI>Dane-court</HI> is another Seat of good Antiquity, and is placed likewise in Sr. <HI>Peters;</HI> It afforded both Seat and Sirname to a Family called <HI>Dane,</HI> who bore for their Coat Armour <HI>Gules four Flower de Lis, Or.</HI> But the Custome of Gavelkind having split this Family into two branches, and consequently rent the estate into two parcels, one of these branches withered away, before the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and went out in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Margaret</HI> married to <HI>John Exeter,</HI> and she by paternal right held some Lands here at <HI>Dane-court,</HI> at her decease, which was in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. But the other branch of this Family flourished something longer; for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>John Dane</HI> the last of this Family at this place, determined in a sole Daughter and Heir, who was matched to <HI>Denne</HI> of <HI>Den-hill,</HI> who had in her right <HI>Dane-court:</HI> but possest not long his new Acquists, for about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, I find it the <HI>Norwoods;</HI> from whom in the Chanel of successive Interest the Title flowed down to Mr. <HI>Alexander Northwood,</HI> who hath lately alienated all his Concernment in it to Mr...... <HI>Smith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ellington</HI> is an ancient Seat in the Parish of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> which was the Residence many Ages since, of a Family called <HI>Ellington,</HI> some of which lay buried under very ancient Gravestones, in this Church of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> with Inscriptions too upon them, as Mr. <HI>Sprackling</HI> not long since deceased informed me: but the Injuries of time and barbarous Hands, have now so violated those Remembrances, that even the memory of this Family, were it not for private Evidences which still preserve Life in it, would have found a Tomb in Oblivion, as well as their Ashes: But to proceed: After this Family had been fixed here for many Descents, about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, it vanished away from this place, being succeeded in the possession by <HI>Thatcher,</HI> a Family of an high Antiquity, as to the Name, both here in <HI>Thanett,</HI> and at <HI>Canter∣bury.</HI> For in the Crown-Office, I discover, as the Record is cited by Mr. <HI>Somner</HI> in his Survey of that City, <HI>Pag.</HI> 77. that a dysastrous Accident brought an untimely Fate to one of this Name; for <HI>Simon</HI> the Son of <HI>Adam de Colynham,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Son of <HI>Henry Thetcher,</HI> in the seventeenth year of K. <HI>Edward,</HI> Son of <HI>Edward</HI> the King that is (<HI>Edward</HI> the second, Son of <HI>Edward</HI> the first) were sitting in a place beneath the Ground, at <HI>Monks∣dane</HI> neer <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and were preparing of Lime-stones, <HI>quos per infortunium Terra supercidit, it a quòd corpora eorum conquassabantur, unde moriebantur incontinenter,</HI> says the Latine-roll: That is, the earth sunk in upon them, and crushed them into the disor∣ders of an early Sepulcher. But to return: After this Seat had rested in this Name, untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> it was passed away to <HI>Spracklin</HI> and remains part of the Demeasn of Mr. ..... <HI>Spracklin,</HI> Fellow of <HI>Peterhouse</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI> at this instant.</P>
<P><HI>Manston</HI> is another ancient Seat in St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> which was the Inheritance of <HI>Manston</HI> for many Generations. <HI>Richard de Manston,</HI> as I find by the Bundles of in∣certain
<PB N="388" REF="202"/>years, kept in the Pipe-Office, was one of the <HI>Recognitoros magnae Assisae</HI> in the Time of King <HI>John:</HI> from whence we may conjecture, that even in those times of so high an Ascent, this Family was under no narrow or contemptible Character or Re∣pute. In latter times, that is, in the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, I find <HI>William Manston</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> and held his Shrievalty at this place: and he had Issue <HI>Nicholas Manston,</HI> who matched with <HI>Eleanor,</HI> only Daughter of <HI>Edmund Haut</HI> Esq; and had Issue <HI>Julian</HI> his Sole Heir, who was matched to <HI>Thomas St. Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Thorn</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Minster</HI> in <HI>Thanett,</HI> which Seat accrued to his Grandfather, by the Heir of Sir <HI>John Goshall.</HI> This <HI>Thomas St. Nicholas,</HI> dyed in the year 1474, and by his last Will recorded in the Prerogative at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> he disposes his Body to be buryed before the Image of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> in the Chancel of <HI>Thorn</HI> at <HI>Minster,</HI> and <HI>Roger St. Nicholas</HI> was his Son and Heir, who determined in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> matched to <HI>John Dynley</HI> of <HI>Worcestershire.</HI> Whose Successor about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> conveyed his Right in <HI>Manston, Powcies,</HI> (which likewise was annexed to the revenue of <HI>St. Nicholas</HI> by the Heir of <HI>Goshall</HI>) and <HI>Thorne</HI> in <HI>Minster,</HI> to Sir <HI>John Roper</HI> afterwards created Baron of <HI>Tenham,</HI> by King <HI>James,</HI> whose great Grandchild the Lord <HI>Christopher Roper,</HI> does still enjoy <HI>Manston</HI> and <HI>Thorne,</HI> but <HI>Powcies</HI> is lately passed away by Sale to <HI>Edward Monins</HI> of <HI>Waldershare</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P><HI>Ʋpper-court</HI> is a third place in St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> which may exact our Notice, because it augmented the demeasn for many Generations, of the illustrious Family of <HI>Crioll,</HI> of whom I have spoken before in <HI>Sarre,</HI> and remained parcel of their Inheritance, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; and then it was passed away by Sir <HI>Thomas Crioll,</HI> to <HI>John White</HI> Esquire, and he dyed possest of it in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth: but before the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, the possession of this place had deserted this Name, and was cast by Sale into the Revenue of <HI>Bere,</HI> and was constant to their Signory, untill almost the times which bordered upon our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was by Sale conveyed to <HI>Johnson,</HI> in which Family it is at this instant resident.</P>
<P><HI>Nether-court</HI> is the last Seat in St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> which calls for our remembrance; It was in Times of an elder Inscription wrapt up in the Inheritance of the ancient and knightly Family of <HI>Goshall</HI> of <HI>Goshall</HI> in <HI>Ash,</HI> and continued in their possession untill the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then this Family going out in a Daughter and Heir, she by espousing <HI>St. Nicholas,</HI> made it come to acknowledge the Signory of that Family, and was permanent in their Name, untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, and then a Vicissitude proportionate to the former, made it parcel of the Demeasn of <HI>John Dynley</HI> of the County of <HI>Worcester</HI> Esquire, who matched with <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Sole Heir to <HI>Roger St. Nicholas,</HI> and remained united to their Interest untill the Beginning of the reign of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> and then the right this Family held in it, was by Sale transplanted into <HI>Maycott;</HI> from whom not long after the same Devolution brought it to <HI>Lucas,</HI> where after some small aboad, the Title discarded that Name, and came by purchase to own <HI>John Anthony</HI> for proprietary; and he in our Fathers Memory passed it away to Mr.... <HI>Johnson,</HI> in whose descendants the Jurisdiction and possession of this Mansion remains still concentered.</P>
<P><HI>Minster</HI> is an eminent Mannor which anciently belonged to the Abby of St. <HI>Au∣gustins,</HI> being fenced in, and invested with several Franchises, and signal Immunities; and when King <HI>Canutus</HI> translated the Body of St. <HI>Mildred</HI> to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and deposi∣ted it in a peculiar Shrine in the Chappel of St. <HI>Augustin's</HI> Abby, a Draught of which is represented to the Readers View, in Mr. <HI>Somners</HI> Survey of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> this Mannor with all those Appendages (which like so many Limbs, made up the Body of that demeasn, which supported the Cloister of St. <HI>Mildred,</HI> as namely the Mannors, of St. <HI>Johns</HI> and St. <HI>Peters,</HI> and St. <HI>Laurence</HI>) was translated by that Prince likewise, and linked by his Confirmation, to the Abby of St. <HI>Augustins.</HI> But how both <HI>Minster</HI> and those other Mannors abovesaid, came originally to be the ecclesiastical patrimony, shall be now my task to discover.</P>
<P><HI>Egbert</HI> or <HI>Egbright</HI> the third Christian King of <HI>Kent,</HI> after <HI>Ethelbert</HI> had by a tacit Consent or Connivance, permitted one <HI>Thunner,</HI> to paddle in the Blood of his two Kinsmen; or, as <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury</HI> will have it, his Brothers called <HI>Ethelbert</HI> and <HI>Etheldred,</HI> persons of a pregnant (hope who like two early Stars, as soon as they began
<PB N="389" REF="202"/>to glitter and shine, fell suddenly into Umbrage, and were hid and eclipsed, with their own Ruines;) he to assoil his hands from those stains, this murder might seem to have bespattered them with, and to make some Recompence or Expiation for so barbarous and clandestine an Assassination, made an <HI>Herodian</HI>-oath, that he would give <HI>Domneva,</HI> Mother of these slaughtered Innocents, whatsoever she would demand of him; and she, biassed and warped by the Advice of the Monkish Counsellors of those times asked of him as much Ground to endow an Abby with, as a tame Deer, which she had nourished, could Run over at a Breath: to which the King had immediately con∣sented had not one <HI>Timor</HI> opposed this design, saying, It was too great a Boon for her to ask, or for him to grant, upon which the earth opened, (says <HI>Thorne</HI> the fabulous Chronicler of St. <HI>Augustins</HI>) and swallowed him up, and became both his Grave and Executioner: and the place where he sunk in, was (as the abovesaid Author asserts) untill the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, which was the time he lived in, called <HI>Timors-leap Well.</HI> The King amazed with this stupendious Accident, assented to her Demand, and the Deer being let loose ran forty eight Ploughlands over, before it de∣sisted.</P>
<P>And thus <HI>Domneva,</HI> by the Aid and Concurrence of the King, erected within the precincts of <HI>Minster,</HI> a Monastery for veiled Nuns, over which she constituted <HI>Mil∣dred</HI> the first Abbesse, who was Daughter to <HI>Wolfchere</HI> King of <HI>Mercia:</HI> and she ga∣thered to her Assistance an Assembly of seventy Virgins, who being defirous to re∣nounce the World, were here vailed for Nuns, by <HI>Theodorus</HI> then Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> And it seems this <HI>Mildred</HI> was a Virgin of that austere, regular, and in∣culpable Life, in the Vogue and verdict of those cloudy times, that her name is re∣gistred in the Calender of <HI>English</HI> Saints, and had that Title attributed to her, both whilst her Body lay at <HI>Minster,</HI> and after its translation to St. <HI>Austins.</HI> He that will survey the Bed-roll of her Miracles recorded at large (one of which was, that when the <HI>Danes</HI> in the reign of King <HI>Etheldred,</HI> harrassed this Island, and put this Cloister at <HI>Minster</HI> into a heap of flame and ruines, her Body remained entire, amidst the Embraces and Scorchings of that devouring and ravenous Element) let him read <HI>Thorne</HI> lately printed, and the Book called <HI>Nova Legenda Angliae;</HI> and when he hath done, he will find that wise-men will laugh, not in Applause, but in Contempt of such religious Romances. But I return to <HI>Minster,</HI> which, as I said before, being transplanted into the patrimony of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> by <HI>Canutus Hugh,</HI> the Abbot of that Cloister, to rescue this Town from that decay which menaced it, upon the removal of the Body of St. <HI>Mildred;</HI> in the year 1116, obtained from <HI>Henry</HI> the first, a Char∣ter to hold a Market weekly at his Mannor of <HI>Minster,</HI> which by disuse and intermission, shrunk into neglect and oblivion: But the greatest blow which was given to it, was the final suppression of the abovesaid Abby; and then it was rent from that Covent, and came to own the Signory of the Crown, and was lodged in its revenue, untill the ninth year of King <HI>James,</HI> and then it was with the appendant Mannors of St. <HI>Johns,</HI> St. <HI>Peters,</HI> and St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> granted to Sir <HI>Philip Cary,</HI> and <HI>John Williams</HI> Esquire, whose Sons and Heirs Sir <HI>John Williams,</HI> and <HI>John Cary</HI> Esquire, do now divide the Inhetitance of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sheriffs-court</HI> in this Parish (but more anciently styled in old Records <HI>Sheriffs-hope</HI>) was the possession of <HI>Reginald de Cornhill,</HI> who had the Custody of this County so long, that it was almost hereditary to him; so that he lost his own Name, and assu∣med that of <HI>le Sheriff;</HI> from whence this place borrowed the Appellation of <HI>Sheriffs∣hope:</HI> but this could not so fence-in the title or chain the possession to this Family, but that about the Beginning <HI>E.</HI> the third, it came to confesse the <HI>Corbies</HI> for proprietaries; and <HI>Robert de Corbie</HI> held it at his death, which was in the thirty ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. Esc. Num</HI> 9. and had Issue <HI>Robert Corbie,</HI> in whom the Male-line was wound up, so that <HI>Joan</HI> his Daughter and Heir, by matching with Sir <HI>Nicholas Wotton,</HI> twice Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> annexed it to the demeasn of that Family, and from him did the title by an unintercepted Current of Descent, glide down to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Wotton,</HI> who setled it in marriage upon his eldest Daughter <HI>Katharine Wotton</HI> wedded to the Lord <HI>Henry Stanhop;</HI> and she, not many years since, conveyed it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Hen. Paramour,</HI> lately deceased, Brother to Mr. <HI>Thomas Paramour</HI> now Lord of the Fee.</P>
<PB N="390" REF="203"/>
<P><HI>Monkton</HI> is a Mannor, that almost from the first Infancy of Christianity in this Island, was wrapped up in that demeasn, which was under the Signory of the Monks of <HI>Christ-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and, as the Book of <HI>Christ-church</HI> informs me, was given to that Church by <HI>Ediva</HI> or <HI>Edgiva</HI> mother of <HI>Edmund,</HI> and <HI>Eadred</HI> or <HI>Edred,</HI> both Kings, in the year 961. And if you will see how it was rated in the Conquerours time, the Pages of <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book will inform you. <HI>Monkton</HI> (says that Register) <HI>est Manerium Monachorum sanctae Trinitatis</HI> (that is <HI>Christ-church,</HI>) <HI>&amp; est de Cibo eorum, &amp; in tempore Edwardi Regis, se defendebat pro</HI> XX <HI>sulling is, &amp; nunc se defendebat pro</HI> X <HI>&amp;</HI> VIII, <HI>&amp; est appretiatum</HI> XL <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> This upon the surrender of the patrimony of <HI>Christ-church</HI> by the Monks of that Cloister, into the hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign, was by him not long after, enstated on his new erected Dean and Chapi∣ter of <HI>Christchurch,</HI> and continued untill these Times, annexed to their Reve∣nue.</P>
<P><HI>Monkton</HI> had Liberty to keep a Market weekly, which was obtained by Grant from <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the seventeenth year of his Rule, by <HI>John Salisbury</HI> then Prior of <HI>Christ-church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stonar</HI> is the last place to be taken Notice of in this Island, and although it be a Parish now without Inhabitants, and a member of the Cinque-ports belonging to <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and hath not enough left of its former Buildings, to direct you to its ori∣ginal Situation; yet was it formerly a Haven-Town, and had a Fair held there yearly five Days together, before the Feast of the Translation of St. <HI>Austin</HI> which was gran∣ted to this place in the year 1104. In the reign of <HI>William Rufus,</HI> about the year 1090, there arose a Suit in Law, between the Londoners, and the Abbot of St. <HI>Augustins,</HI> (to whom this Mannor was given, with the residue of that revenue, which belonged to the Nunnery at <HI>Minster</HI> by King <HI>Canutus,</HI> upon the translation of the Body of St. <HI>Mildred</HI> to that Cloister) as touching the right of the Haven of <HI>Stonar,</HI> wherein by the favourable Aid of the Prince, the Citizens (as <HI>Spot</HI> Chronicler to that Abby re∣ports) had the overthrow. But the utter ruine and subversion of the Town, happened in the year 1385, about the ninth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, at what time the <HI>French</HI> with 18 Sail of Gallies, designing to infest the Maritine parts of <HI>Kent,</HI> landed and layed this Town of <HI>Stonar</HI> in Ashes, which ever since hath found a Sepulcher in its own Rubbish. And accuses the bad Government of Sir <HI>Simon de Burley,</HI> the then Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Constable of <HI>Dover</HI>-Castle as cheif Author thereof. For when his demands were utterly refused and denyed, and not suffered to have the inestimable Or∣naments and Riches of St. <HI>Thomas Beckets</HI> shrine, and the Jewels of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> re∣moved to <HI>Dover</HI>-Castle, upon pretence of safe-keeping them there, then he grew slack and remisse in securing the Sea-Coast, and Isle of <HI>Thanett,</HI> so that when the Abbot of St. <HI>Augustins</HI> had raised a considerable Strength of his Tenants about <HI>Northburn,</HI> and, bending towards the Island, endeavoured to have passed over at <HI>Sandwich;</HI> Sir <HI>Simon de Burley</HI> would not permit him, so that he was constrained by a long and redious March all Night, to go about by <HI>Fordwich</HI> and <HI>Sturrey</HI> into the Island, and made such vigorous resistance, that the Enemies fled to their Gallies, without doing any farther prejudice to the Islanders. Then Sir <HI>Simon</HI> procures the King to send out his Mandate under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> requiring all that had Lands, or belonged to <HI>Sandwich,</HI> to be Commorant there, and to find competent Arms, according to the Quality of their Estates and Faculties, upon pain of Imprisonment, and Forfeiture of all they had to loose. And sends in the Kings Name to the Abbot to remove with his Forces from <HI>Thanet,</HI> to the Guard of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> as a place of more Importance: But the Abbot (saith <HI>Thorne</HI> that continued the Chronicle of <HI>Spot</HI>) neither astonished with the power of the Enemy, nor seduced with the Inticements, or terrified with the Menaces of the Traytor <HI>Burley,</HI> remained in the Island to defend his own and his Tenants posses∣sions. After this, there is nothing observable at this place, untill the Suppression of the Abby of St. <HI>Austins,</HI> and the Resignation of its Revenue, into the hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, when this Mannor with the rest of their demeasn, having improved the patrimony of the Crown, it was in the fourth and fifth of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> granted to <HI>Nicholas Crispe</HI> Esquire, from whom it is now descended to Mr. <HI>Nicholas Crispe</HI> his Successor, the instant Lord of the Fee.</P>

<P>There was in elder times a Guard assigned for the security of the passage between <HI>Sand∣wich</HI> and <HI>Stonar;</HI> for I find that <HI>Ed.</HI> the second granted <HI>VVill. Turke</HI> for Life in the seventh year of his reign, the passage between <HI>Stonar</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and the Perquisites and Emoluments emergent from it; which Grant, was in the eighteenth year of that Prince, renewed by Patent, and invested for Life, with all its adherences, in <HI>Ralph St. Laurence</HI> of the Isle of <HI>Thanet.</HI> And then again in the thirteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find that that Prince grants <HI>John Giboun, Marmario suo,</HI> those are the words in the Latine Record: but what they import in <HI>English,</HI> I confesse I am ignorant of the profits of the passage betwen <HI>Sandwich</HI> and <HI>Stonar,</HI> for the defence and protection of it.</P>
<P>I shall wind up this Discourse, with informing the Reader, that the cheifest Scenes both of War and Peace, have been laid in or neer this Island. <HI>Rutupis</HI> or <HI>Richborough</HI> on the opposite Shore, was an eminent Fortresse of the Romans, and the first presidiary Station that Antiquity represents them to have erected within <HI>Britain.</HI> When <HI>Hengist</HI> arrived with his <HI>Saxons,</HI> to support the harrassed and afflicted <HI>Britons,</HI> against the eruptions of the <HI>Picts,</HI> he first landed in this Island, and when his Forces were broken by <HI>Vortimer</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Alresford,</HI> he made <HI>Thanet</HI> his Retreat and Shelter; When <HI>Austin</HI> the Monk arrived here in <HI>England</HI> with the light of Truth, to dispel the mists of Paganisme and Infidelity, and disseminate the Christian Religion amongst the <HI>Saxons,</HI> he found his first Reception in this Island. How often the <HI>Danes</HI> made <HI>Thanet</HI> a Winter Station for their Navies, when they made their barbarous Impressions on the Maritime Coasts of this Nation, I think our Chronicles do sufficiently inform us. And lastly, when <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dolphin</HI> was called in by the mutinous <HI>English</HI> Barons, to assert their Quarrel with additional Supplies against King <HI>John,</HI> he laid the first Scene of that War in this Island, which he afterwards scattered on the Face of this unhappy Nation.</P>
