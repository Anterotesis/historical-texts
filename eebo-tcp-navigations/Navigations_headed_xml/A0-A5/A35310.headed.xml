<HEAD>To my Honoured Friend
Sir EDMƲND WARCƲP,
Of OXFORDSHIRE, K<SUB>t.</SUB></HEAD>
<P>I Am fully perswaded there is a certain
Sympathy betwixt Travellors. As for
my part, I am very free to make this in∣genious
Confession, that as the first motive
of my courting your acquaintance, was the
extraordinary Character you had acquired
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n your Travels abroad; so the History of
<HI>Italy,</HI> wherewith you have obliged the
World some Years ago, did raise in me a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertain Ambition of being received among
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he number of your Friends. The con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruity
there is betwixt all Histories, tho'
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f different Nations, and far distant Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries,
will be, I hope, a sufficient Plea for
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Address to you; 'tis true, this Rela∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on
will not afford the same variety of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eautiful Structures, Gardens, Statues and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther Niceties as that of <HI>Italy;</HI> neverthe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess
the more remote the Manners, Reli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
and Policy of the <HI>Muscovit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> are from
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> the more abstruse
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir History and surprising in the event,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong a Nation guided for the most part
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eerly by instinct, and consequently hur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
on to one extreme or another, the
<PB REF="3"/>
more, I say, they may deserve our particu∣lar
observation at this juncture of time.
But besides this motive peculiar to my self▪
there are also several other Obligations, for
which, by the general acknowledgment o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all true <HI>English</HI> Men, your Native Coun∣try
stands indebted to you, and never
ought to be Buried in Oblivion. The ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
Proofs you gave at your younger Years▪
both of your Capacity and Readiness to
serve your Country, in the Treaty of the
Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> in the Year 1647. and 1648<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were the fore runners of a long Concatena∣tion
of Services, you and your Family have
since heaped upon the Kingdom of <HI>England▪</HI>
There are as yet many living Testimonies o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
your successful endeavours in the Restau∣ration
of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. of Blessed Memo∣ry;
and, as the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> shew'd
their readiness in acknowledging your Ser∣vices
to the Publick, by investing you in
the Year 1670. with the Dignity of a Do∣ctor
of the Civil Laws, <HI>in honorem Princi∣pis
Auriaci,</HI> now our present King; so, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was questionless, both upon the score o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
your Merits and Ability, that by the par∣ticular
Commands of his then Majesty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Privy Council, and the Lords Spiritual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Temporal in Parliament Assembled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
you were appointed for the searching into<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and prosecuting the Discovery of that mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
horrid Popish Plot, carried on against th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="3"/>
Life of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the Government.
I will not enlarge my self here upon the
singular Benefit the Government received
at that time by your Care and Vigilancy,
to your no small charge and hazard; the
publick Testimonies, and reiterated Recom∣mendations
to his then Majesty, from the
House of Peers, are sufficient Evidences of
these Eminent Services, you did to the
Government, during the prosecution of that
Conspiracy: But there is one thing more,
which, in my Opinion, ought before all
others, not to be pass'd by in silence; I
mean your continuance in <HI>Westminster,</HI> du∣ring
the greatest Plague <HI>England</HI> ever felt.
What could be a more evident proof of
your undaunted Courage and entire Devo∣tion
to the service of your Native Country,
than to tarry at a time of so eminent a Dan∣ger,
in the midst of a great many Thou∣sands
expiring round about you; where in
Conjunction with Sir <HI>Edmund Bury Godfrey,</HI>
you were appointed by His then Majesty's
Commission, to take care in Quality of Justi∣ces
of Peace, of the Out-Parishes, to the great
Satisfaction of the Publick. Your two Sons
Col. <HI>Lenthall Warcup,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Edm. War∣cup,</HI>
at the Unfortunate, but Glorious Day
of Battle at <HI>Steenkirke</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in the
Year 1693. gave such illustrious Demon∣strations▪
of being true Inheritors of your
Courage and Love to their Native Coun∣try,
<PB REF="4"/>
that their fall was generally lamented,
and their Names have ever since been pla∣ced
in the most Honourable Remembrances
of all those who esteem it a Glory, to Sacri∣fice
their Lives for the Defence of their
Country. Being confined to the compass of a
Letter, I am forced to deprive my self of the
satisfaction, of giving the due praises to their
Memory, but in lieu of them, I will offer to
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Names as a perpetual remembrance of
their Bravery the following Words of the
Honourable Sir <HI>James Vernon; There was ne∣ver</HI>
(said he, speaking to you, of your Sons)
<HI>a Battalion behaved themselves better, than
that which your Son commanded; nor any Offi∣cer
so universally regretted as he was: And I do
not doubt, but your younger Son would have trod
his Brother's Foot-steps, had he not soon after
met with the same Fate. They have given</HI> (con∣tinues
he) <HI>the best Account of the Life they re∣ceived
from you: And I, who have a more nu∣merous
Stock of Sons than yours was, know not
what better to wish for them, than that they
may run the same Hazards, in the same Cause;
and may be so loved, and so missed.</HI> Thus, re∣commending
my self to the Continuation of
your Friendship, I rest,</P>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst a great many other Advan∣tages,
which the <HI>English</HI> Nation
enjoys under the Auspicious Reign
of His present Majesty, the In∣fluence
this Crown has in Foreign Affairs, may
be look't upon as one of the most considerable,
whether in respect of the Honour, or Benefit,
which is from thence derived to the Generali∣ty
of the People of <HI>England.</HI> For, whereas
our Intestine Broils, and the Carelesness of the
two preceding Reigns, had render'd the Inte∣rest
of this Island almost as much divided from
that of other States of <HI>Europe,</HI> as it is sepa∣rated
from the Neighbouring Countries by the
Ocean, it must be acknowledged, that it is
chiefly owing to the incomparable Valour of
His present <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty that the
<HI>English</HI> have re-gain'd their Ancient Repu∣tation
abroad; and that in so eminent a De∣gree,
that even the most potent Princes, in
far distant Countries, looking upon this King∣dom
<PB REF="5"/>
as one of the most considerable in <HI>Europe,</HI>
shew a more than ordinary Deference to His
Majesty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It is, withont
Question, upon that Score, we have seen so
lately one of the greatest Princes in the World
leave, for some Time, his own Country, and,
maugre the Tediousness of so great a Journey,
came to visit this Island. As I am well as∣sured
that this Journey of His present <HI>Czar∣rish</HI>
Majesty is without a Parallel in the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
Empire, so it was that which gave the
first Opportunity of engaging my Thoughts in
the following Treatise. I was not insensible
there were many Obstacles to be surmounted,
in an Undertaking of this Nature: And I was
not ignorant, that the Want of Learning,
and the Natural Propensity of the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
in general to Jealousie and Secresie,
would render it, at least, very difficult, if
not quite impractieable, to give an exact Ac∣count
of so vast an Empire, composed out of
several Nations, distinguished in their Lan∣guages,
Religion and Manner of Living.
These Considerations were so prevailing with
me, as to check my first Inclinations, in hopes
that some Body or another would lay hold on so
favourable an Opportunity of giving a true De∣scription
of a Country which has been but su∣perficially
known hitherto in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But perceiving that no Body would venture
to engage himself in the Design, I took a
<PB REF="5"/>
Resolution to undertake the Task, though ne∣ver
so difficult, rather than to let slip so sea∣sonable
an Opportunity, as offered it self, by
the Arrival of His present <HI>Czarrish</HI> Majesty
in <HI>England,</HI> of giving the Publick the best
Account I could of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire. The
Vastness of its Territories (a great many
whereof are quite unfrequented by Strangers)
did put me under an absolute Necessity of ha∣ving
Recourse to those of several Nations in
<HI>Europe,</HI> that have had the Opportunity of
Travelling in <HI>Muscovy.</HI> For, as I was ful∣ly
resolved to insert nothing in this Treatise,
but what I had received upon the Credlt of
those that had been Eye-Witnesses of their
own Relations; so I was obliged to consult the
Travels, and most especially the Embassies, of
the <HI>English, Germans, French, Dutch,</HI> and
other Nations, into those Parts. And, for
as much as it is obvious, that scarce ever any
one Foreigner did visit one half of this spa∣cious
Empire, I was put under an indispen∣sable
Necessity of supplying the Defects of one,
with the Relations of others, who had (accor∣ding
to their several Occasions) taken different
Roads in their Travels through <HI>Muscovy.</HI>
But here it was, I found my self engaged in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese Difficulties, which were not easie to be
surmounted: For, in comparing the several
Relations of different Persons, and Nations,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found it a very difficult Task to reconcile,
<PB REF="6"/>
in some measure, the various Descriptions of
Places, especially in what relates to their Si∣tuations
and Distances; occasioned, doubtless,
by the most stupid Ignorance and Jealousie of
those <HI>Muscovites</HI> from whom they had receiv∣ed
their Intelligence. The History of <HI>Mus∣covy</HI>
it self, even that of the last Age, is en∣tangled
in such Perplexities, in point of Chro∣nology,
that some of the best Historians of our
Age (whom I will forbear to name) have
been surprised into some Mistakes of this na∣ture.
For the rest; As the Manners and Cu∣stoms
of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> as well as their Re∣ligion
and Policy, are very different from
most other Nations in <HI>Europe;</HI> and either
not at all, or, at least, but superficially known
in these Parts; so the ensuing Relation may,
in all probability, serve, not only to instruct,
but also to divert the curious Reader. I must
confess, the present <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire might
well have deserved a Treatise suitable, in
Bulk, to its vast Extent: But the Eager∣ness
which most of my Friends shewed in the
Publishing of it at this Season, obliged me t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
contract it into as narrow a Compass as the
Matter would allow of: Which, as it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
been done with all the Brevity imaginable▪
so I have been very careful in not passing b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
any thing of Moment, which I believed migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be material, and tend to the Satisfaction o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Reader. It was for this Reason also, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="6"/>
thought it most expedient to divide the whole
into two distinct Volumes; the first of which
contains a Description of those several Na∣tions,
and vast Territories, under the Obe∣dience
of the present Grand <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Musco∣vy;</HI>
together with their Laws, Customs,
Manner of Living, Religion, and Policy:
With an Account of the Origin of the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
Empire, and its Increase, till the Death
of that famous Tyrant <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> to∣wards
the Latter End of the last Age. But
the various and most surprizing Revolutions,
which, after the Death of this Grand Tyrant,
happen'd in the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire, either
in Consideration of their various Vicissitudes,
or the Strangeness of their Events, surpassing
not only what former Ages have delivered of
this kind, but hardly to be parallell'd by Po∣sterity,
I reserved the full and exact Rela∣tion
of them to the Second Volume; with a
Continuation of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> History, and
the whole State of Affairs, from the Year
1613, (when the Family of the present <HI>Czar</HI>
first ascended the Throne,) till the Arrival of
His <HI>Czarrish</HI> Majesty in this Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Territories belonging to the Grand

<P><HI>MƲscovy</HI> was formerly the Name properly
belonging to one Province only, of the
<HI>Russian Empire,</HI> of which <HI>Musco</HI> is the
Capital City. But, as it is observable in

now adays, all those vast Provinces under the
<HI>Grand Czar</HI>'s Obedience. This vast Country (a
Part of the Antients <HI>Sarmatia Europaa)</HI> was here∣tofore
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
known by the Name of <HI>Roxolania, Russia,</HI> or
<HI>White Russia,</HI> from whence the Name of <HI>Russians,</HI>
given to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> has its derivation. It is
without question the greatest Empire of all <HI>Europe,</HI>
its length being near Six Hundred, and its breadth
above Three Hundred Leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extent of the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI> Em∣pire.</NOTE> Northward it ex∣tends

the West it borders upon <HI>Poland, Livonia,</HI> and <HI>Sweden;</HI>
its whole extent being from the 46 to 66 degrees
of Latitude, and from the 55 to the 80th. de∣gree
of Longitude; Considering the vast distance
of the several Provinces which compose this great
Empire, it is easie to be imagined, that of necessity
there must be a great difference as to the length of
Days, Heat and Cold, and no small variety of Sea∣sons,
Soil and Fruits, according to their several Cli∣mates,
of which we shall have occasion to say more
hereafter, when each of them will be treated of in
particular. Nevertheless it is generally excessive
Cold in the Winter, and the Heats in the Summer,
during the space of two or three Months, very in∣tense
and violent. The Country is generally flat and
Sandy, full of Trees and Woods, so that <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
in a manner, appears to be one continual Forest,
irrigated by a great multitude of Lakes and Rivers,
which renders it incomparably pleasant in the Sum∣mer,
and extreamly commodious for Travelling
and Trading in the Winter.</P>
<P>The Lakes most remarkable for their bigness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Muscovy.</HI></NOTE> are,

several small Islands, and great store of Fish, its

<P>It is particularly observable in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that
most of its Rivers, even those of the first Rank,
take their original from Lakes. The River <HI>Volga</HI>

the Province of <HI>Roscovie,</HI> and derives its name from
another Lake, at some few Miles distance from the
former, called <HI>Volga,</HI> through which it passes, and
after having traversed many Provinces, and receiv∣ed
a great number of small Rivers, it disembogues
near <HI>Astrachan</HI> into the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI> The next
considerable River is the <HI>Boristhenes</HI> or <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per;</HI> it
takes its source in the same Province of <HI>Rosco∣vie,</HI>
where the <HI>Volga</HI> does, and discharges it self
into the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI> The River <HI>Oby</HI> taking its
source from the Lake <HI>Catisco,</HI> traverses the Desarts
of <HI>Tartary,</HI> from South to North-west, and having
served as a boundary betwixt that Country and
the Muscovian Territories, discharges it self into
the <HI>Frozen Sea.</HI> Besides these, there are two con∣siderable
Rivers of the same name, called <HI>Duina▪</HI>
(i. e.) <HI>Twain</HI> or <HI>Two,</HI> the first being the confluence
of two Rivers, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Jagel</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cogna,</HI> dis∣embogues
into the white Sea, near the Famous

Conquests among the Neighbouring <HI>Tartars,</HI> the

Knez,</HI> that is, Great Lord, in imitation of the
<HI>Turkish Grand Seignior;</HI> and that of <HI>Czar,</HI> or his
Czarish Majesty. And tho' the Word <HI>Czar</HI> in the
Russian Language, signifies as much as a King, the
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Russians nevertheless, having understood, that the
Chief among the Christian Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> is
stiled by the Name of <HI>Kaysar</HI> (derived from the
Name of him, who laid the first Foundation of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Monarchy) the Great Duke's Interpreters
make use of the same Word, when they recite their
Master's Titles, the affinity which is in the sound of
the two Words of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Czar,</HI> having que∣stionless
furnished them with an Opportunity, to
commit this wilful Mistake in Etymology. The
Arms which they make use of in their Great Seal,
ever since the Reign of that Famous Tyrant <HI>John

the Roman Emperours, <HI>viz.</HI> A double-headed
<HI>Spread-Eagle</HI> (the Wings only somewhat less than

<HI>Southern Muscovy</HI> comprehends ten Provinces. The
first is the Province of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> properly so called,
which has communicated its Name to the whole
Empire; it is a flat Country, beautified with great
store of Forests (most of them of Firrs and Beech∣trees)
Lakes and Rivers, abounding in every thing re∣quisite
for the Sustenance of Human Life; the Forests
abounding with Honey, and all sorts of Game, as
the Plains do with Grass and Corn, and the Rivers
and Lakes furnish the whole Country with a pro∣digious
quantity of all so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of Fish, except Carps,
which are not to be found here, or if they are in
some places, they eat harsh, and are quite neglected
in a Country where they have such store of the best
Fish in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11" MS="y"/>
The Capital City of this Province is <HI>Musco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Descrip∣tion of the City of <HI>Musco.</HI></NOTE> the
Metropolis of the whole Empire, to which it has
given its Name; as it has derived its own from the
River <HI>Moska,</HI> which passes through and divides that
part of the City, called <HI>Strelitza Sla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oda,</HI> from the
rest, and after having received the two small Ri∣vers
of <HI>Neglina</HI> and <HI>Yagusa,</HI> and joined its Current
with the River <HI>Occa,</HI> falls afterwards into the great
River <HI>Wolga.</HI> It is situated in a very fair Plain,
betwixt the three above-mentioned Rivers; its Fi∣gure
is almost Circular, containing in its Circumfe∣rence
Fifteen or Sixteen Miles at least, tho', by rea∣son
of the Conflagrations which frequently happen
in this City, both its form and extent do not con∣tinue
many Years in the same condition. It lies al∣most
in the Centre of the whole Empire, being at
an equal distance from the Frontiers, which on ei∣ther
side are above 600 Miles. Its Elevation is 55
Degrees and 36 Min. Latitude: Its Longitude 66
Degrees. Before the <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> in the Year 1571
destroyed it, and the <HI>Poles</HI> burnt it to the Ground
all but the Castle, in the Year 1611. it was doubt∣less
much bigger than it is now; nevertheless, there
being by computation numbred near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0000 Houses;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0000</NOTE>
this, with the largeness of its Streets, and the Inter∣vals
betwixt the Houses, makes it one of the greatest
and most considerable, tho' not the most Popu∣lous
Cities of <HI>Europe.</HI> The City of <HI>Musco,</HI> like
most of all the other Towns in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> is built all
of Wood, except the Palaces of Persons of the
first Rank, some Churches and Chappels, and the
Houses of some very Rich Merchants, which are
of Brick or Stone, it being the general Custom
throughout all <HI>Muscovy</HI> to build their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouses of
Wood, made up of Beams and Cross-pieces of Firr,
laid and joyned one upon another, the vacuities
being fill'd up with Moss; they are covered with
Barks of Trees, upon which they sometimes lay
another covering of Turffs, the better to defend
themselves against the Injuries of the Winter-Season.
The Streets of the City of <HI>Musco</HI> are very spacious,
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
and handsom enough in dry Weather, but after the
least Rain very dirty, and would for some time of
the Year be rendred quite unpassable, were it not
for the great quantity of Firr Posts, which being
laid cross the Streets like a Bridge, serve instead of
a Pavement. The combustible Matter, of which
their Houses are composed, together with the care∣lessness
and disorderly House-keeping of the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
(they being much given to Drunkenness)
makes their Houses very subject to the mischances
of Fire. In the City of <HI>Musco</HI> there are certain In∣tervals
left from place to place, and the sooner to
quench the fury of the Flames, the Guards and
Watch in the Night-time carry Poll-axes, where∣with
they instantly break down the next adjoyning
Houses to those that are on fire. Notwithstanding
all these precautions, there is seldom a Week with∣out
some damage done by Fire, which however the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> are the less disturbed at, by how much
more common it is, and may be repaired without
any considerable Loss to the Owners; their Fur∣niture
consisting commonly of a few Benches only
(which also serve instead of Beds) and some
Earthen or Wooden Dishes; And as for their Houses,
they are almost as soon repaired as lost, there being
a certain Market without the white Wall of this
City, where at a very easie rate (Wood being so
over-plenty in this Country) they buy a House of
what bigness they please, ready built, which, in a
little time is taken down, and transported to the
Place, where the other House stood before.</P>
<P>The whole Body of this great City is divided
into four distinct Quarters or Circuits.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musco</HI> di∣vided into four Quar∣ters.</NOTE></P>
<P>The first, which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> call <HI>Cataygorod,</HI>
or the Mid-City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cataygo∣rod,</HI> or the Mid-City.</NOTE> is situated in the centre of the
others, being divided from the rest by a Brick Wall,
called <HI>Cresne Stenna,</HI> or red Stone, and surrounded
almost by the two Rivers of <HI>Mosca</HI> and <HI>Neglina,</HI>
the first passing by it on the South, and joyning with
the latter on the North-side behind the Castle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle of <HI>Musco.</HI></NOTE> The
Castle of the Grand Dukes, called <HI>Cremelena</HI> by the
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<HI>Russians,</HI> takes up near one half of it, being at least
two Miles in circumference, and very well forti∣fied
with a triple strong Wall, very well mounted
with Cannon, and strengthened by a very good
Ditch. The Palace it self stands at the further end
of the Castle, next adjoyning to that of the Pa∣triarch,
being built of Stone after the <HI>Italian</HI> man∣ner,
about Fifty Years ago; notwithstanding which,
the <HI>Czars</HI> used, during the Winter-Season, to eat
and to sleep in some Apartments made of Wood,
as being less moist than the others. Besides that,
there are several <HI>Boyars,</HI> who have great Places at
Court, and live within the Castle in very fair Hou∣ses
of Stone; there are several Convents of Monks
and Nuns, and near Fifty Churches and Chappels
of Stone, the chiefest of which are those of St. <HI>Ma∣ry</HI>'s,
St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and that of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> Famous
for the Tombs of the Great Dukes of <HI>Russia.</HI> A∣mong
a great many other Steeples, which adorn
these Churches, and are all covered with Copper,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd large Crosses gilt on the top of them, which

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articularly worth taking notice of, being both in

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilt, its height being computed to be near the same
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith that of St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s in <HI>Venice.</HI> The second is
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly Remarkable for its Great Bell, which being

There are also within the compass of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Castle kept several of the Courts of Justice,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Exchequer, and the Grand Magazine of Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sion
and Ammunition. Immediately without the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates of the Castle Walls, is a very fair Church on
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e South side, called St. <HI>Trinity,</HI> or <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich appeared so extraordinary a piece of Archi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cture
to that great Tyrant <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> that, as
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
soon as it was finish'd, he caused the Architect's
Eyes to be pull'd out, to prevent his attempting
any thing like it hereafter. The Castle is faced by
a very fair spacious Place, the chief Market of the
whole City, and place of Resort, not only for
Buyers, but for Persons of all degrees, eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the

to vend their hidden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. But,
what is the most regular and beautiful, is, that each
particular Street leading to this Market-place, has
a certain Trade allotted by it self, so that the Merce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
does not intermingle with the Woollen-Draper, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Taylor, or Shooemaker, but every Trade having
its proper Station, the Buyer may, with the greatest
conveniency in the World, in an instant, cast his Eyes
upon such Commodities, as will serve his occasion.
It ought not to be forgotten here, that the Painters
have none of the meanest Station among the rest
here, for their Employment being to furnish the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> with the Images of Saints, they deal with
their Chapmen by way of Exchange, or Trucking,
where they are sure to make their own Market; for

<P>The Province of <HI>Wologda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wologda.</NOTE> which sometime be∣longed
to the Dukes of <HI>Novogorod,</HI> is since re∣united
to the Crown of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> its Capital City
has the same Name with the Province, both of
them having borrowed their Names from the River
<HI>Vologda,</HI> which having its rise near the famous City
of <HI>Novogorod Veliki,</HI> disembogues in the <HI>Baltick Sea.</HI>
The City of <HI>Wologda,</HI> or <HI>Vologda,</HI> is one of the
most considerable in those Parts, not only by reason
of its bigness and strength, being surrounded with
a very strong Wall, but also of its Commerce. It
is situated on the left Shoar of the River <HI>Sucagna,</HI>
raised upon the very Banks of it, which River
running by <HI>Tetma</HI> and <HI>Ʋstiga,</HI> runs some Miles be∣low
the latter into the above-mentioned River
<HI>Dwina,</HI> which renders it very convenient for Tra∣ding,
and consequently very populous. There are
two Cities more in this Province, called <HI>Socsoa,</HI> and
<HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>litz.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Ʋstiugha,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ustiugha.</NOTE> lying betwixt
the Provinces of <HI>Dwina</HI> and <HI>Wologda,</HI> was also
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
subject to the Dukes of <HI>Novogorod,</HI> till, like
all the rest in those Parts, it was united to the
Crown of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> The Capital City here is like∣wise
called <HI>Ʋstiugha,</HI> from the Word <HI>Ʋst,</HI> which
signifies as much as the Latin Word <HI>Ostium,</HI> or the
Mouth of a River, and <HI>Jugh;</HI> it being not far di∣stant
from the conflux of the River <HI>Jugh</HI> and <HI>Su∣cagna,</HI>
built upon the very Banks of the latter,
which at some Miles below this place exo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erates it
self in the River <HI>Dwina,</HI> as we have m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioned be∣fore.
It has its own <HI>Weywode</HI> or Governour. This
Province is famous for the best black Foxes it af∣fords,
above all others in <HI>Muscovy.</HI> It has two Ci∣ties
more, called <HI>Kollas,</HI> and <HI>Dobri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a.</HI></P>
<P>The next Province, both for Rank and Situation,
is <HI>Novogorod Veliki,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogo∣rod Veliki▪</NOTE> owing its Name to its Capital
City, likewise called <HI>Novogorod Veliki.</HI> It is seated
in a very fair spacious Plain, at 58 degrees 23 min.
Elevation, upon the <HI>Wologda,</HI> or <HI>Vologda</HI> (a River
different from the <HI>Volga.)</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Vologda.</HI></NOTE> The River <HI>Vologda</HI> hath
its rise out of the Lake of <HI>Ilmen,</HI> about three Miles
above this City, from whence, crossing the Lake of
<HI>Ladoga,</HI> it passes in its way through the River <HI>Niova,</HI>
the Boundary betwixt <HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> on that
side, near the City of <HI>Noteburgh,</HI> till at last, by the
Gulph of <HI>Finland</HI> it exonerates it self into the <HI>Bal∣tick
Sea.</HI> This River is of great Advantage to this
City, affording not only great store of all sorts of
most excellent Fish at a very cheap rate, but also,
being Navigable from its very source, and the Coun∣try
round about very fruitful, abounding in Wheat,
Flax, Hemp, Wax, and Honey, but especially in
<HI>Russia</HI> Leather, which is look'd upon here to be bet∣ter
dress'd than in any other part of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> makes
this City to be reputed one of the chief Trading
Cities in the whole Empire. It was in former Ages
governed by its own Princes, who having extended
their Conquests over several of the adjacent Pro∣vinces,
as has been mentioned before, this City was
look'd upon as one of the most Potent and cele∣brated
of <HI>Europe,</HI> so that it was grown into a Pro∣verb
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
in those Parts: <HI>Who can oppose God, and the
Great City of</HI> Novogorod? The <HI>Hanseatick Towns</HI>
had in those days an Office of Address in this City,
so that it was not only frequented by the Livonians
and Muscovites, but also by the <HI>Danes, Germans,</HI>
and <HI>Swedes.</HI> It was Sirnamed <HI>Veliki,</HI> which signi∣fies
<HI>Great,</HI> there having been some who have com∣pared
it for greatness with <HI>Rome</HI> it self. It's true,
they have in this much over-shot the Mark, never∣theless
the great extent of the Ruines of the An∣tient
Walls, and the number of its Steeples yet re∣maining,
are sufficient Proofs of its fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer Glory,
and that its present condition falls incomparably
short of what it was before its destruction, the
City being now only surrounded with a Wooden
Wall, and the Houses built of the same Materials.
The first that put a stop to the Grandeur of this
Place, was <HI>Vithold,</HI> Great Duke of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and
at that time General of the Polish Army, who, in
the Year 1427. oblig'd it to pay a considerable Tri∣bute
to that Crown. About Fifty Years after, the
Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy, John Basili Grotsdin,</HI> fa∣mous
for his Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anny, after a War of Seven Years,
having defeated their Army in the Year 1477. for∣ced
them to do him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omage, and to receive a
Muscovian Governour, and soon after put a fatal
period to this Great and Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent City. For, having
considered with himself, that its Inhabitants would
not fail to take hold of the first Opportunity to
recover their Liberty, went thither in Person, un∣der
pretence of establishing the Greek Religion,
which he pretended to be in danger by the contri∣vances
of the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> being encouraged in
his Design by <HI>Theophilus,</HI> the then Archbishop of
the City, he had no sooner entred the City, but it
was, by his Order, pillaged, and the Inhabitants
transported from thence into other places of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
but especially to <HI>Nise-Novogorod,</HI> which we
have spoke of before, in whose stead he planted
there a Colony of Muscovites. The Booty which
he got there was incredible, having, besides all sorts
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
of Rich Stuffs, and other sumptuous Moveables,
carried away Three Hundred Waggons loaded with
Gold, Silver, and Jewels. About Fourscore Years
after, <HI>Viz.</HI> in the Year 1569. the then Great Duke
of <HI>Muscovy, John Basilowitz,</HI> having conceived the
same Suspicion, entred the City with an Army, and
after he had caused an infinite number of People
to be trampled to Death by the Horses Feet, and
some Thousands killed by the Sword, such a mul∣titude
of dead Bodies were thrown into the River
<HI>Wolgda,</HI> that its Current being stop'd, the Neigh∣bouring
Fields were overflown round about the
Town. The stench of the dead Carcasses caused
such an Infection in the Air, that, what had esca∣ped
the Fury of the Soldiers, was destroyed either
by the Plague or Famine, no body daring to ven∣ture
to carry thither any Provisions; But that which
was the most inhumane of all, was, that even the
few remnants that had escap'd his former Cruelty,
the Plague, and Famine, (having fed upon dead
Carcasses) were at last all cut to pieces by the Ty∣rant's
Soldiers. Notwithstanding all these Calami∣ties
sustained, its advantageous Situation for Com∣merce,
has, in process of time, drawn thither a
considerable number of new Inhabitants, by whose
Industry it is brought into that State it appears now,
which, tho' it must only be look'd upon as a meer
Shadow of that great Body, it represented in for∣mer
Ages, nevertheless, next to the City of <HI>Arch∣angel,</HI>
it may pass for one of the most considerable
Trading Towns in those Parts. For, besides the
Wooden Fortifications, we have mentioned before,
it has a Castle on the other side of the River, op∣posite
to the City, and joyn'd to it by a Bridge;
This Castle is surrounded by a strong Stone Wall,
being the Residence both of the <HI>Weywode</HI> and the
<HI>Metropolitan,</HI> who has the Management of Eccle∣siastical
Affairs over this Province. Over against
this Castle, on the same side of the River with the
City, is a Monastery, dedicated to St. <HI>Anthony;</HI>
The Muscovites relate most surprising Miracles of
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
this Saint, among the rest they shew a great Mill∣stone
lying against the Wall of the Convent, upon
which, they say, St. <HI>Anthony</HI> perform'd his Voyage
from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Novogorod; Viz.</HI> by going down the
<HI>Tiber;</HI> This Stone Ship having carried him (if any
body will believe it) over the Seas, from the <HI>Me∣diterranean</HI>

There is another Monastery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

to be pass'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. It is related, that before
<HI>Novogorod</HI> and the ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent places were converted
to the Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, these Pagans used to Sacri∣fice
to a certain Idol, called <HI>Perun,</HI> or the God of
Fire, <HI>Perun</HI> signifying in the Muscovian Language,
as much as Fire. This Idol was represented with a
Thunder-bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his hand, near which was kept a
constant Fire of Oak, which was never to go out,
at the peril of their Lives, who had the charge of
it. After the Inhabitants had embraced Christia∣nity,
the Idol was thrown into the River, its Tem∣ple
razed, and this Convent built on the same place
where the Temple of the Idol stood before. There
is also in this Province the City of <HI>Ladoga,</HI> situated
on this side of the Lake <HI>Ladoga,</HI> (from whence it
has its Name) which is there-abouts near Three∣score
Miles broad; and, on the other side of it, at
about 80 Miles distance, the City of <HI>Laba,</HI> the ut∣most
Frontier-Town of the Muscovites on that
side. About seven Miles on this side of <HI>Ladoga,</HI> in
the River <HI>Wolgda,</HI> there is a most dangerous Cataract
or fall of Water among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rocks, and at six Miles
thence another, not far from the Monastery called

a very good Ditch, and a Noble Counterscarp well
pallisado'd, belonging to the City of <HI>Smolensko;</HI>
but the City it self has but a single Wall without a

the Year 1514. But was recovered near a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undred

In the Year 1633. the Great Duke <HI>Michael Fede∣rovits</HI>
besieged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with an Army of above 100000
Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Smolensko</HI></NOTE> among whom were several Thousand Ger∣mans,

by German, English, Scots, and French Officers,
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
with a vast Train of Artillery, consisting of 300
Cannon, and all other things requisite to carry on
the Siege with the utmost vigour; under the Com∣mand
of a Polander, called <HI>Herman Slein,</HI> who had
been rebaptized in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and by his Treachery
(as it was supposed) lost the whole Army. For,
the Germans having soon made a Breach in the
Wall, were for giving an Assault, which being op∣posed
by the General, they were seconded by the
rest of the Foreign Officers; whereupon, having
mounted the Breach, they were very near Masters
of it, when the General, turning his Cannon against
them, forc'd them to retreat, alledging, that it was
not for the Honour of his Czarish Majesty, that a
handful of Foreigners should carry away the Glory
of the Siege. In the mean while the King of <HI>Po∣land</HI>
having gathered a Body of Five or Six Thou∣sand
<HI>Poles,</HI> posted his Forces on several Avenues
which led to the Muscovian Camp, by which
they must of necessity receive their Provision, with∣out
the least Opposition made by the Muscovites,
(who, without much difficulty, might have pre∣vented
the Poles) so, that having sufficient leisure
given them to Fortifie themselves, the Muscovian
Army was in a little time reduced to that Extre∣mity,
for want of Provisions, that their General
(who never so much as attempted to force the <HI>Poles</HI>
out of their Posts) was forced to make a shame∣ful
Capitulation for himself and the whole Army,
with all the Artillery and Baggage, to Surrender at
Discretion, and to leave sufficient Hostages for the
Ransom of all the Officers and Soldiers, which was
accordingly paid by the Great Duke. The Gene∣ral,
relying upon the Favour of the Archbishop,
and some other great Men at Court, who were su∣spected
to have had a hand in this Treachery, re∣turn'd
to <HI>Musco,</HI> not without hopes of being pro∣tected
against what the Officers might lay to his
charge. But both the People and Soldiers being so
incensed against him, that every thing seemed to
tend to a general Insurrection, his Head was in the

Year next following, cut off in the Market-place
before the Castle, where also his Son, who had a
considerable Command under his Father, in the

Notwithstanding this Disgrace, the Succes∣sor

great River as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> and begin
with the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Kingdom of <HI>Casan.</HI></P>
<P>Forty miles distant from the City of <HI>Basiligorod,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King∣dom of <HI>Ca∣san.</HI></NOTE>
is the City of <HI>Kusmademianski,</HI> situate at the foot
of a Mountain, on the right side of the River, the
whole Country thereabouts being like one continu∣ed
Forest of Elms of an extraordinary compass.
Forty miles further down the River, and on the
same Shoar, is the City of <HI>Sabakzar,</HI> the most plea∣sant
for its Situation in those Parts; and 25 Miles
lower, after you have passed two or three small
Islands, on the left side of the <HI>Volga,</HI> a little City,
called <HI>Kockshage.</HI> On the same side, some Miles
lower, is the City of <HI>Suiatski,</HI> built on the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cent
of a Hill. The Castle and some Churches are of
Stone, the rest of the Buildings and Fortifications,
of Wood. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 20 Miles on this side of the City
of <HI>Casan,</HI> the Shoar all along betwixt these two
places, being covered with chalky and Sandy Moun∣tains.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Casan</HI> is seated in a fruitful Plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Casan.</HI></NOTE>
in 55 degree 38 min. Elev. seven Miles distant
from the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> upon the River <HI>Casanska,</HI>
which has given the name both to the City and
Province. It is a very large City, but its Houses
and Fortifications (as most all others in those parts)
of Wood. But the Castle and its Fortifications,
which consist in four Bastions, and a good many
Towers, is of Stone, the River serving for a Ditch
about it. The Garrison is composed of <HI>Muscovites</HI>
only, under their own Weywode, but the City is
inhabited both by <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who
have their own Governour. The Province of <HI>Casan</HI>
lies on the left side of the River <HI>Volga,</HI> bordering
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
to the East upon <HI>Astrachan,</HI> to the North upon the
<HI>Siberian Tartars.</HI> It was heretofore Subject to the
<HI>Cham of Tartary,</HI> till it was conquer'd by the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
in the following Manner:</P>
<P>The Great Duke <HI>Basili Ivanovits</HI> (Father to that
famous Tyrant <HI>Ivan Basilovits)</HI> after a signal Victo∣ry
obtained over these <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conquest of <HI>Casan.</HI></NOTE> had constituted
one <HI>Sheale</HI> their Governour, against, whom, with
the assistance of the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI> they made an
Insurrection, and forced him out of the Country;
Flush'd with this Success, they marched into the
<HI>Southern Muscovy,</HI> under the conduct of two Bro∣thers,
<HI>Mendligeri</HI> and <HI>Sapgeri,</HI> who forced the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
that were Encamped near the River <HI>Occa,</HI>
to Retreat under <HI>Noviogorod.</HI> There being nothing
in their way to stop their March to the City of
<HI>Musco,</HI> the same was besieged, taken, and plun∣dered;
and the Castle also forced to capitulate (be∣ing
first reduced to the utmost extremity) upon
very hard conditions, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Great Duke and
his Subjects should be Tributaries to them for ever;
and as a Sign of this their Subjection, the Great
Duke should be obliged to smite his Head before
the Statue of <HI>Mendligeri,</HI> erected for that purpose
in the Market place of the City, as often as the Tri∣bute
should be paid to the <HI>Tartars.</HI> The Great
Duke having been forced by an unavoidable necessi∣ty
to confirm these Articles by his Letters Patents,
the two Brothers parted, <HI>Sapgeri</HI> chusing <HI>Casan</HI> for
the Seat of his Empire, <HI>Mendligeri,</HI> being the El∣der,
the City of <HI>Crim.</HI> But, the latter having in
view no less than the Conquest of the whole <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
marched soon after against the City of <HI>Rhesan,</HI>
and having summon'd <HI>John Kowar,</HI> the Weywode of
the Castle, to surrender, unto whom he represented
how the Great Duke his Master, was become his
Subject; the Governour pretending to be quite igno∣rant
of the Matter, desir'd that some more satisfa∣ctory
Proof might be given him, before he could
resolve upon a Capitulation. <HI>Mendligeri</HI> imagining,
that nothing could be more convincing than the
<PB N="32" REF="24"/>
Great Duke's own Letters Patents, sent them to
the Governour, who extreamly glad of having got so
favourable an opportunity, to recover, by this Stra∣tagem,
the Great Duke's original Letters, sent word
to the Besiegers, that he was resolved to keep both
the Letters and Castle to the last drop of Blood.
Neither was he behind hand in his Promises, but
with the Assistance of a certain <HI>Italian</HI> Connoneer,
he so Gall'd the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that having forced them
to Retreat from before the Town and Castle, he
sent the Letters to the Court of the Great Duke.
The people being over-joy'd at so lucky and unex∣pected
an Accident, broke down the Statue; and
the <HI>Czar</HI> taking Courage by the Example of his
Subjects, besieg'd the City of <HI>Casan;</HI> but, after
much Blood shed on both sides, was forced to raise
the Siege. After the Death of the Great Duke
<HI>Basili Ivanovitz,</HI> his Son, <HI>John Basilovitz,</HI> being de∣sirous
to revenge the Affront his Father had receiv∣ed
before <HI>Casan,</HI> began his Reign with the Siege of
that City. The place was for the space of two
Months, batter'd furiously, when he offer'd them
very advantageous Conditions, which they having
refused in hopes of Succour from the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI>
the Great Duke, not to loose Time, ordered his
Mines to be sprung, which succeeded so well, that
a vast Number of <HI>Tartars</HI> were buried in their own
Ruins; During this Consternation, the General
Assault was given, and the Place carried by Storm,
the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1552. not without a
great Slaughter, the <HI>Tartars</HI> defending themselves
with the utmost Bravery, in two several Retrench∣ments
within the City, after the Enemy had made
themselves Masters of the Breach; and, at last,
seeing all past Recovery, they forc'd their Way out
of one of the Gates, through the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Camp,
and got on the other side of the River <HI>Casanska.</HI>
The <HI>Czar</HI> knowing the Importance of the Place,
which made him Master of the whole Province, or∣dered
immediately the Breaches to be Repair'd, and
some considerable Additions to be made to the Ca∣stle;
<PB N="33" REF="24"/>
ever since which, it has remain'd in the
Possession of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who are
allow'd to live in the City, not daring, under se∣vere
Punishments, to set a foot between the Walls
of the Castle. The Country hereabouts is extream∣ly
fertile, especially of all sorts of Fruit, Melons grow∣ing
there of an extraordinary Taste, coming in big∣ness
near to our Pompions, but not very populous,
by reason of the frequent Incursions of the <HI>Cosacks.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed, that the course of the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The course of the Ri∣ver <HI>Volga</HI></NOTE> from the City of <HI>Nise Novogorod</HI> to <HI>Casan,</HI>
is East and South East-ward, but from thence to
the City of <HI>Astrachan,</HI> and so further to the <HI>Caspian
Sea;</HI> its current runs from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>About 60 Miles below <HI>Casan,</HI> the River <HI>Kama,</HI>
coming North-East out of the Province of <HI>Permia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Kama.</HI></NOTE>
falls on the left side into the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> and about
30 Miles lower the River <HI>Zerdick,</HI> being a branch
of the River <HI>Kama,</HI> falls also into the same River.
At about 30 Miles distance from hence is situate, on
a little Ascent, the City of <HI>Tetus,</HI> on the right side
of the Shoar, resembling, by its disorderly Buildings,
rather a great Village, than a City.</P>
<P>Twenty five Miles lower, not many Miles from the
opposite Shoar of the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> is the River <HI>Ʋtka,</HI>
which rises near the City of <HI>Bulgar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣vince of <HI>Bulgar.</HI></NOTE> the capital of a
<HI>Tartarian Province,</HI> to which it had given its name.</P>
<P>Some Miles lower is an Island, called <HI>Staritzza,</HI>
being above 15 Miles long, and not far below this
the Ruins of a considerable City among the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
called <HI>Ʋrenoskora.</HI> It is a place very delightful for
its Situation, and famous to this day, for the Bu∣rying
of one of their Saints, to whom they pay a
great deal of Devotion.</P>
<P>A good many Miles lower, at the right side of
the River <HI>Volga,</HI> are likewise to be seen the Ruins
of two other great Cities, not far distant from one
another, very pleasantly seated near the River side;
the first was called <HI>Simberska Gora,</HI> the second <HI>Ar∣beuchim,</HI>
from an adjacent Mountain, that retains
the same name to this day; they were both destroy∣ed
<PB N="34" REF="25"/>
by <HI>Tamerlan,</HI> being situate under the 53 deg.
El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. The River <HI>Wolga</HI> is hereabouts (as most all
along from its very Source to the <HI>Caspian Sea)</HI> full
of Sand-banks and small Islands, which lying scat∣ter'd
up and down on both Shoars, render its passage
very difficult, and sometimes unpassable for Vessels
of great Burthen, who are obliged to go for the
most part in the Months of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> when,
by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Snow being melted, and the Ri∣vers,
which fall into it, being thaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, the Waters of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> River swell up to an extraordinary hight; so,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often they afford a passage to the Boats over
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Islands. The River <HI>Volga</HI> contains a pro∣digious
Store of Fish, of all Sorts, (a very good
Commodity in <HI>Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovy,</HI> by reason of the great
number of their <HI>Fast-days)</HI> which both the <HI>Tartars</HI>
and <HI>Muscovites</HI> catch with a Cord, but in a differ∣ent
manner. The <HI>Tartars</HI> fasten to the end of a
long Cord a pretty big Stone, which sinks to the
bottom, several great pieces of Wood being fastn'd
to the other end,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> which swim upon the Water. All
along this great Cord, many littles ones are fastn'd,
at some distance from one another, each of these
has at the end a good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook, baited with a certain Fish,
which they know the rest to be greedy of, by which
Invention they catch often Fish of ten, twelve, and
more foot long. The <HI>Muscovites</HI> take also a Cord,
with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook fastn'd to the end of it; this Cord
is ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d about a piece of a well plain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Board, tinn'd
over, its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igness about 4 or 5 Inches square, which
being dragg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d behind a Boat by the reflection of the
Sun, resembles the Scales of Fish, by which means
they draw up Fish of a very great seize to the Bait
and into the Snare. Among other Fish, wherewith
this River abounds, the Sturgeon is none of the
least considerable, whose Eggs afford that Ragout,
which the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Cavayar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> and the <HI>Muscovites,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> the Eggs are put into a Paste, being pre∣par'd
10 or 12 days with Salt; This Commodity
affords a considerable Trade to <HI>Muscovy,</HI> being ex∣ported
from thence to all Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> where
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
it is look'd upon as the best of this kind, for which
reason, the <HI>Czar</HI> keeps this Trade to himself.</P>
<P>Some Miles below the abovementioned ruined
places, the Shoar on both sides of the River is very
Mountainous, yet not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, but that the Valleys af∣ford
very pleasant Pastures. The first that appears
on the right hand is a Mountain, out of which the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> get great store of Salt, which being
prepared in certain Huts at the foot of the Moun∣tain,
is sent from thence by the River to <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o.</HI>
Almost opposite to this is another Mountain, at the
foot of which, the River <HI>Ʋssa</HI> falls into the <HI>Wolga;</HI>
On both sides are very fine Meadows, bordering
upon the Shoar, but at some distance from thence
are very thick Woods, a place of retreat for the
<HI>Cosacks,</HI> which makes it very dangerous for Tra∣vellors.
Below this lies the Mountain <HI>Diwiagora,</HI>
or <HI>Maids-mountain,</HI> which being divided into se∣veral
steepy' Hills of various colours, and bearing
Pine-trees in so regular an Order, as if they had been
planted there on purpose, makes it appear very plea∣sant
to the eye. At the foot of this, rises another,
which reaches near 40 Miles along the River. But,
what is most remarkable here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>Valley.</HI></NOTE> is the Valleys betwixt
them, which being stor'd with Apple-trees affords
very good Cyder, being called by the Muscovites <HI>Ja∣bla-New-quas,</HI>
which is as much to say, as <HI>Drink of
Apples.</HI> Some of these Mountains reach a great way in∣to
the Country, others bordering only upon the Ri∣ver-side.
At the left side of the River, about two
Miles from the Shoar, lies the City of <HI>Samara,</HI> be∣longing
to the abovementioned <HI>Tartarian Province</HI>
of <HI>Bulgar,</HI> and above 300 Miles distant from the
City of <HI>Casan.</HI> Its Form is square, its Buildings
all of Wood, except the Churches and Monasteries,
which are three in number. The River of <HI>Samar,</HI>
from whence it derives its name, falls about three
Miles below into the <HI>Volga:</HI> About 100 Miles
from hence is the Mountain of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> being
all bare without any Wood, it serves for a retreat∣ing
place to the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> living upon the <HI>Don</HI> or
<HI>Tanais,</HI> and hath from thence got its denomination.
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
Betwixt this and the City of <HI>Saratof,</HI> (above 200
Miles distant from hence) are abundance of small
Islands in this River, so that at certain Seasons it
has been fordable, and consequently very incom∣mod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous
for Ships of Burthen, who at such places
are obliged to unload part of their Cargo in smaller
Boats, which they carry along with them for that
purpose. The City of <HI>Saratof</HI> is situate in a very
fair large Plain, about four Miles from the River∣side
upon a Branch of the <HI>Wolga.</HI> It is inhabited
by Muscovite Soldiers, who are put there as a Guard
against the Incursions of the <HI>Tartars</HI> called <HI>Kal∣muches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tartars Kal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣ches.</NOTE>
Inhabiting a vast Tract of Ground which
extends towards the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> betwixt this Ri∣ver
and the River <HI>Jaika.</HI></P>
<P>About Three Hundred Miles lower, 50 Miles on
this side the City of <HI>Zariza,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River Tanais.</NOTE> the River <HI>Don</HI> (the
<HI>Tanais</HI> of the Antient Geographers) advances with∣in
a days Journey near the River <HI>Volga;</HI> as some
Miles below the said City, behind a certain Island,
called the Isle of <HI>Zerpinsko,</HI> there falls a little Ri∣ver,
called <HI>Kamous</HI> (which rises out of the before∣mentioned
River <HI>Don)</HI> into the River <HI>Volga,</HI>
but it being very shallow, affords scarce passage for
small Boats; Notwithstanding which, there are
some who affirm, that it might be rendred more
Navigable, and consequently a Communication be
established betwixt these two considerable Rivers.</P>
<P>Near the first of these two above-mentioned
places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Branch of the <HI>Wolga</HI></NOTE> before you come to the City of <HI>Zariza,</HI>
near <HI>Achtobska Ʋtska,</HI> the River <HI>Volga</HI> divides it self
into two Branches, whereof one taking its course
to the left, into the Country, carries its Stream for
a Mile to the North-East, quite contrary to the
Current of the great River, but afterwards re∣assuming
its former course, returns to the South-East,
till it falls into the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI> About 40
Miles from hence, at 5 Mile distance from the Ri∣ver-side,
are to be seen the Ruins of a great City▪
formerly called <HI>Zaaresgorod,</HI> that is to say, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Royal,</HI> built, as it is related, by <HI>Tamerlain;</HI> Its <HI>Pa∣lace</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="26"/>
and Walls were all of Brick, which have fur∣nish'd
the City of <HI>Astrachan,</HI> for these many Years,
with Materials for their Walls, Churches, and Mo∣nasteries.
A few Miles from this Place lies the City
of <HI>Zariza,</HI> at the bottom of a Hill, on the right
side of the River, 49 Degrees and 42 min. Ele∣vation.
It is fortified with several Bastions and
Towers, but all of Wood; it being a Frontier-Garison
against the Neighbouring <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Cos∣sacks,</HI>
and inhabited only by Soldiers, who also
serve for a Convoy to the Vessels passing this way
up and down the River. All abouts here, and even
as far as <HI>Astrachan</HI> it self, the Country (except the
before-mentioned Island of <HI>Zerpinsko,</HI> which is
Twelve Miles long, and furnishes the Cattle belong∣ing
to the Garison, with Grass) the Soil is so bar∣ren,
that it affords no manner of Corn, which de∣fect
however, is easily supplyed by help of the Ri∣ver;
the fertile Grounds about <HI>Casan</HI> furnishing
these Parts, and even the City of <HI>Astrachan</HI> with
Wheat at a very cheap rate. About Sixscore Miles
below the City of <HI>Zariza,</HI> the River <HI>Wesowi,</HI> near
a small Island of the same Name, falls into the
<HI>Wolga,</HI> on the right side, as does the River <HI>Wolo∣dinerski
Ʋtsga</HI> 30 Miles lower.</P>
<P>At Forty Miles distance from hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Branch o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Wolga</HI></NOTE> the River
<HI>Wolga</HI> casts out its second Branch on the left side,
called <HI>Achtobenisna Ʋtsga,</HI> which afterwards joyns
with the Branch called <HI>Achtobska,</HI> which we men∣tioned
before. From this Place down on both
sides of the River, as far as <HI>Astrachan,</HI> there grows
a prodigious quantity of Liquorice of a very large
size,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rice.</NOTE> its stalks being as thick as a lusty Man's Arm,
and sometimes above four Foot high, the Seeds ly∣ing
in Cods upon the stalks; yet is this inferiour,
both in bigness and sweetness, to that which grows
in <HI>Asia,</HI> near the River of <HI>Araxes.</HI> Twenty Miles
lower is the City of <HI>Szornogar,</HI> seated on the right
side of the River, upon a high Shoar, near a vast
Plain, without any Trees or Eminencies; its form
is four-square, fortified with Wooden Towers and
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
Ramparts, it serves for a Frontier-Garison against
the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Cosacks.</HI> About 120 Miles hence
is the Mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Polowon,</HI> so called, because half

precedents; And Twenty Miles from thence the
River <HI>Wolga</HI> makes a fourth Branch on the left side
of it, called <HI>Danitoska Ʋtsga,</HI> which does not min∣gle
with any of the other three, but disembogues
by a particular Channel into the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Near 60 Miles on this side of <HI>Astrachan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Branch of the <HI>Wolga</HI></NOTE> is the

<P>Five and twenty Miles on this side of <HI>Astrachan</HI>

Branches of the River, as has been said before,
under the Elevation of 26 deg. 22 min. It is of
a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsiderable bigness, and now all inhabited by
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> the Inhabitants of the Country being
<HI>Tartars,</HI> who are not permitted to live within the
compass of the Walls (which is 8000 Geometrical
Feet about) but in the adjacent Suburbs, which are
fenc'd in only with Pallisadoes. The Fortification<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
are all very high, and of Stone, which at a distance
make a very gallant appearance, especially towards
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
the River-side, by reason of a great number of
Turrets and Steeples of Stone; but the Houses
within the City being all built of Wood, and very
low, its inside does not appear answerable to the
rest. There is accounted to be a great Artillery in
this place of 500 Brass Cannon, and Mortars pro∣portionable.
The Garrison, in time of Peace, com∣monly
amounts to 5000 Men, under the Command
of two Weywodes, and other Officers. This City
being seated upon the Confines of the two most
considerable Parts of the World, it must needs be
a Place of great Commerce, it being, besides the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> frequented not only by the Neighbour∣ing
<HI>Tartars,</HI> but also by the <HI>Persians, Armenians,</HI>
and <HI>Indians,</HI> the last of which have a particular
place assigned them within the City. It was taken
by Assault in the Year 1554. by the Great Duke
<HI>John Basilovits,</HI> who having two Years before con∣quer'd
the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Casan,</HI> turn'd his Arms a∣gainst
those of <HI>Nagaja,</HI> then inhabiting this City
and the Country round about it. Having secured
his Conquest over them by taking their Capital City,
he surrounded it with a strong Wall, and the Czar
<HI>Michael Federovits</HI> added to it besides some new
Fortifications, that part of the City which is called
<HI>Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>litzagorod,</HI> or the <HI>City of Soldiers,</HI> they having
their Quarters assigned them in this part of the City.
But before we leave this Kingdom, it will not be
beyond our purpose to give a short Description both
of the Country and its Inhabitants.</P>
<P>It is past all question that the <HI>Tartars</HI> were un∣known
to the Antient Geographers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> which were

of <HI>Scythians</HI> and <HI>Sarmatians,</HI> tho' it be manifest
that the <HI>Tartars</HI> consist of several Nations, distin∣guish'd
in their Names, Language, and manner of
Life. Those of <HI>Nagaja,</HI> with the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Casan,</HI>
before mentioned, and some others betwixt the
River <HI>Wolga</HI> and the <HI>Don</HI> or <HI>Tanais,</HI> are said to have
been <HI>Indians,</HI> who having revolted from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
did about the Year 1212. settle themselves near
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> upon the <HI>Palus Meotides,</HI> the Place
of Habitation of the Antient <HI>Getae;</HI> from whence
they extended their Conquests, first, to the River
<HI>Don,</HI> and from thence at last to the <HI>Wolga,</HI> near
which they inhabit to this day. Those of <HI>Nagaja,</HI>
of whom we are to treat at present, are seated be∣twixt
the two Rivers of <HI>Wolga</HI> and <HI>Jaika,</HI> as far as
the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI> The City of <HI>Astrachan</HI> is their
principal City, built, as they say, by a <HI>Tartar</HI> King,
whose Name being <HI>Astra-Chan,</HI> gave it the Name
of <HI>Astrachan.</HI> Before this Country was conquered
by the Muscovites, it was inhabited altogether by
<HI>Tartars,</HI> but now the latter are not permitted to
abide in the Capital City, or to build any new ones,
nor to fortifie their Towns or Villages with Walls.</P>
<P>They live for the most part in Huts made of Bull∣rushes
or Canes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man∣ner of Li∣ving.</NOTE> which are commonly round, sel∣dom
exceeding twelve or thirteen <HI>English</HI> Yards in
compass, on the top of which they have holes, most
like our Chicken-coops, serving them instead of
Chimneys, nevertheless the least of these Huts has
a Faulcon or Hawk, the <HI>Tartars</HI> being great Masters
in this Sport. The Muscovites call these <HI>Nagajan
Tartars Polutski,</HI> or <HI>Vagabonds,</HI> as having no fixt
Habitation in the Summer, when they ramble up
and down, according as they meet with the best
conveniency for their Cattle, which beginning to
fail in one place, their Huts are put into Carts, and
their Wives, Children, and Goods upon Camels,
Horses, or Oxen, and so removed to another. To∣wards
the Winter they begin to reassemble, and to
live in several Troops near <HI>Astrachan,</HI> where being
furnish'd with Arms by the Muscovites (which
however after the Frosty Season is past, they are
obliged to redeliver, not being otherwise permitted
to have any Arms, either Defensive or Offensive)
they stand upon their Mutual Defence against the
<HI>Malmuck Tartars,</HI> and those Inhabiting upon the
River <HI>Jaika.</HI> They pay no Tribute to the Grand
<HI>Czar,</HI> but are obliged to serve him in his Wars;
they are govern'd by petty Princes and Judges of
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
their own, and in time of War by their own Com∣manders;
The Great Duke, to secure their Alle∣giance
to him, always keeps some of their Princes
or <HI>Myrses</HI> as Hostages in the Castle of <HI>Astrachan.</HI></P>
<P>They are generally Mahometans,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> of the same
Sect with the <HI>Turks,</HI> except some few that have re∣ceived
the Muscovian Religion. They are used to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow some of their Children, like the <HI>Nazarites,</HI>
to God, or some Saint or other. These are distin∣guish'd
from others by a Ring which the Girles
wear in their Nostrils, the Boys in the right Ear.
They live upon what their Cattle, their Hunting,
and Fishing supply them withal; they make use of
Fish dry'd in the Sun, instead of Bread, tho' they
make also Cakes of Meal and Rice. Among other
things they eat Camel's and Horse-flesh, and Mare's
Milk is in great esteem with them. Their Drink
is generally Milk and Water, tho', besides Wine,
Hydromel, and <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> there is indifferent good
Beer at <HI>Astrachan.</HI> Their Cattel is of a very large
size, not unlike to that of <HI>Poland.</HI> Their Sheep
have great fat Tayls, weighing sometimes Thirty
pounds, their Ears hanging down like to our Dogs
in <HI>Europe.</HI> Their Horses are however but small,
and not well shaped, but very hardy and strong.
The <HI>Tartars</HI> themselves are of an ill shape, low
and fat, with large Faces, and little Eyes, of an
Olive colour, full of wrinkles in their Faces, they
wear little Beards, and keep their Heads shaved;
but the Women are much handsomer. Their Gar∣ment
is a loose Coat of some course Cloath, over
which they wear a short sort of Cloak of Sheep's-Skin,
the woolly side outwards, with a Cap of the
same upon their Heads, which commonly is
chosen of a black colour. The Women are clad in
white Linnen Cloath, with plaited Coifs upon their
Heads, on both sides of which, as an Ornament,
hang a great many Muscovian Penny-pieces. The
Climate in those Parts is very hot, the Heats in the
Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October</HI> much exceeding
our Dog-days; notwithstanding which, the Win∣ter,
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>
which seldom exceeds two Months here, is so
cold, that this large River is commonly frozen up,
and bears Sledges.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Dolgoi,</HI> upon which the City of
<HI>Astrachan</HI> is built, is all over Sandy, and barren,
and, except it be some Gardens and Grounds cul∣tivated
with particular care by the Inhabitants of
<HI>Astrachan,</HI> produces nothing fit for Sustenance. The
Continent on the right hand exceeds, if possible,
the Isle in barrenness, but on the left there are some
very good Pastures.</P>
<P>On this side of the <HI>Wolga</HI> Westward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Desarts near <HI>Astra¦chan.</HI></NOTE> towards the
<HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> lies a vast Desart above 350 Miles long,
and to the South another near 400 Miles long,
stretching all along the <HI>Caspian Sea.</HI> In these De∣sarts
is neither City nor Village, nay, not so much
as a Tree or Hill, there being nothing to be seen
but one continued vast Plain, covered here and
there with a little Grass, for the space of 300 Miles
there being not any Water to be met withal but
what the little River <HI>Kisilar,</HI> and some standing
Pools of Salt Water afford. Notwithstanding which,
these Desarts produce a prodigious quantity of Salt.
For within Ten, Fifteen, and Thirty Miles of <HI>Astra∣chan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt-Pits.</NOTE>
there are large Salt-Veins, which being con∣gealed
by the Sun, swim upon the surface of the
Water, of the thickness of a Finger, as fine and
clear as Rock Crystal. These Salt-Pits hereabouts
are by the Inhabitants called, <HI>Mozakofski, Kainkowa,</HI>
and <HI>Gwostofski,</HI> and produce such abundance of Salt,
that upon the spot one may have a Hundred weight
under two pence, which being from thence carried
to the <HI>Wolga,</HI> is transported into other Parts. Be∣sides
which, the Isle of <HI>Dolgoi</HI> about <HI>Astrachan</HI> and
some other parts of this Province, as also of <HI>Cir∣cassia</HI>
(of which we shall have occasion to speak
in the next following Chapter) are stor'd with ex∣cellent
Fruit, not yielding either in beauty or taste
to any,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fruits <HI>of</HI> Nagaja</NOTE> even not to those of <HI>Persia</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI>
Their Apples, Quinces, Nuts, Peaches, and Melons
exceed the rest in goodness, but especially a certain
<PB N="43" REF="29"/>
kind of Melons, whose Rind being of a lively green
colour, the Meat Carnation, and the Seeds black,
are the most pleasing both to the Eye and Palate,
and are sold at a very cheap rate, two or three of
them being to be bought for a Penny. It is not
above Fourscore Years ago since any Grapes were
to be seen in those Parts, but the <HI>Persians</HI> having
brought some Sets thither, which were first planted
by a Monk, a German by birth, in the Garden be∣longing,
to his Convent, situate in the Suburbs of
<HI>Astrachan;</HI> this small Stock has been since impro∣ved
and increased to that degree, that not only the
Walks and Arbours of the Gardens, but also about
the Houses of the Inhabitants are planted with
Vines, which growing to an extraordinary bigness
there, affords not only great store of Grapes
for their present use, but also a superplus for most
Excellent Wine. Besides which, near <HI>Astrachan,</HI>
and all along the <HI>Wolga,</HI> there grows abundance of
Simples, and very large; The Herb <HI>Esula</HI> is here∣abouts

<HI>Astrachan</HI> is one of the best Fishing-places
upon the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> which furnishes that City
with Salmons, Sturgeons, White Fish, and many
other sorts of delicious Fish, and the small Islands
hereabouts great variety of Wild Fowl; and tho'
the Country hereabouts is not very fertile in Corn,
(which in these Parts is trodden out by Oxen and
Horses) they are supply'd with that sufficiently from
about <HI>Casan</HI> by the River, all which makes this
City one of the most pleasant and convenient for
its Situation in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Mouth of the River <HI>Wolga</HI> is about 60 Miles
below <HI>Astrachan.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mouth of the <HI>Wolga.</HI></NOTE> From its Entrance into the <HI>Caspian

there are scattered a great number of Islands, very

has occasioned some to affirm, that the <HI>Wolga</HI> has
as many Mouths as there are Islands hereabouts.
The bottom of the Sea is here very muddy, and

<P>About 40 Miles from this City is the Isle of <HI>Tzen∣zeni,</HI>

height of this Mountain has furnish'd the Poets
with that Fiction of <HI>Prometheus</HI> having from thence
conveyed the Fire, stoln from the Sun, down upon
the Earth. The Mountain of <HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Ararat</HI>
are so near to it, that they appear like one conti∣nued
Mountain, which crosses all <HI>Asia,</HI> from <HI>Men∣grelia</HI>

who call it <HI>Messina,</HI> believing to this day,
that there are some remainders of that Ark upon
this Mountain, but by length of time all petrified;
which, how agreeable or disagreeable to Truth, is
impossible to be determined, the Mountain being so
surrounded with Precipices, that it is unaccessible.
These high Mountains are a great direction to the
Mariners in those Parts, most of whom having lit∣tle
or no Understanding of the Compass; the dif∣ferent

<P><PB N="45" REF="30"/>
The <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> was in antient times known by
the name of <HI>Chosar,</HI> having derived its name from
the eldest Son of <HI>Thogarma,</HI> who was the Son of
<HI>Gomer,</HI> and Grand child of <HI>Japhet,</HI> third Son to
<HI>Noah.</HI> It is now a-days known by various names,
according to the diversity of the Inhabitants and
Provinces bordering upon it. Some Geographers
have call'd it the Sea of <HI>Travisthan;</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Latin</HI> Authors, the <HI>Hyrcanian Sea,</HI> as also <HI>Mare
Caspium</HI> and <HI>Caspianum;</HI> the <HI>Muscovites</HI> name it
<HI>Gualenskoi-more.</HI> Its length from South to North,
<HI>viz.</HI> from the mouth of the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> below
the City of <HI>Astrachan,</HI> to <HI>Ferebath</HI> in the Province
of <HI>Mesenderan,</HI> reaching eight degrees to the <HI>Aqua∣tor,</HI>
making 120 <HI>German,</HI> or 600 <HI>English</HI> Miles; Its
breadth from the Province of <HI>Chuarasm</HI> or <HI>Karra∣gon</HI>
to <HI>Shirwan, viz.</HI> from West to East is six degrees,
making 90 <HI>German,</HI> or 450 <HI>English</HI> Miles; and though
according to the opinion both of the antient and
most modern Geographers, its length be reckon∣ed
quite contrary to this, <HI>viz.</HI> from West to East,
and its breadth from North to South, nevertheless
upon the most exact Enquiry that could possibly be
made, the first account has been found most con∣gruous
both with the <HI>Persian</HI> Registers of Longi∣tudes
and Latitudes, and with the true Situation
of the Maritim Provinces adjoyning to that Sea.
There is also another Error introduced by <HI>Pompo∣nius
Mela, Pliny,</HI> and some of their followers, as
<HI>Strabo, Macrobius,</HI> and others, who affirm the <HI>Cas∣pian
Sea</HI> to be a <HI>Sinus,</HI> or Gulph of the <HI>Indian</HI> or
<HI>Tartarian Sea,</HI> or to have a communication with
the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> and by the River <HI>Tanais,</HI> with the
<HI>Palus Meotides.</HI> But according to the best Survey
made by some <HI>Europians</HI> of late Years, of this Sea,
and the constant Report of the <HI>Persians,</HI> bordering
upon it, it seems to be now passed all Dispute, that
the Opinion of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI> who af∣firm,
that the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> is a particular Sea by it
self, not having any communication with other
Seas, is the most credible; it being on all sides
<PB N="46" REF="31"/>
so encompass'd with Land, that it deserves the
name of the <HI>Mediteranean</HI> in a more strict sense,
than that which is commonly known by that
name. Besides the great Rivers of <HI>Wolga, Araxis,
Cyrus,</HI> the <HI>Jaika</HI> and <HI>Jems,</HI> the <HI>Nios,</HI> the <HI>Oxus,</HI> and
the <HI>Orxentes,</HI> near a hundred other Rivers of less
note, fall into this Sea; and notwithstanding all
these prodigious Accessions of Waters, it is not
sensibly increased; which may seem to furnish a
probable Argument to those, who assert, that the
Waters of these Rivers must needs be conveyed
thence by some great and considerable Passages, or
open communication with other Seas. The <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
are of opinion, that under the Mountains near
<HI>Ferebath,</HI> betwixt the Provinces of <HI>Tauristan</HI> and
<HI>Mesendan,</HI> there is a Gulph where these Waters are
swallowed up, and conveyed away under the Earth.
But, why may not the same reason take place here,
which is alledged for the Oceans not overflowing
the Earth by the accession of so many Rivers? <HI>viz.</HI>
That, besides the Mists, which consume a great
part, the rest is conveyed by infinite secret Chan∣nels
through the Earth back again to the Source of
the Fountains and Rivers, so that by the help of
those Veins of the Earth, these Waters being pu∣rified
of their Filth, and separated by this continu∣al
Percolation from their Salt, are by an interrupted
circulation reconveyed to the same Fountains and
Rivers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> being either quite undiscovered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Caspi∣an Sea</HI> not very well known to the Antients.</NOTE>
or but superficially known to the antient <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<HI>Romans,</HI> before the latter carried their Arms beyond
the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> it is no wonder if the relations those
Authors have left us about it, are for a great part
not consonant to Truth, and some modern Writers,
misguided by their Authority, and having taken
the rest perhaps upon hear-say, have inferted a great
many things, which are contradicted by Experi∣ence.
What <HI>Curtius</HI> relates concerning the <HI>Caspian
Sea,</HI> being fresher than the Ocean, proves a mistake,
it being full as Salt as the Waters of the Ocean;
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>
tho' upon the Coast of <HI>Hyrcania</HI> (now called <HI>Kilan</HI>)
the Water is only brackish, because of the mixture
of a great many Rivers which fall into this Sea on
that side; which may probably have led the above∣mentioned
Author into that Error, tho' the same
may be observed in the Ocean; especially upon the
Coast of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> by reason of the
fresh Waters of divers Rivers, which exonerate
themselves thereabouts. What the same Author
relates of a vast number of Serpents in this Sea, is
positively contradicted by the Inhabitants of the
Province of <HI>Kilan,</HI> and others bordering upon that
Sea: <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> in his Geography speaks of a
vast number of Monsters, which he calls <HI>Belluae,</HI>
abiding in this Sea, which he alledges for one main
Reason, why it is scarce Navigable; whereas it is
sufficiently known, that the true Reason why the
<HI>Persians, Tartars</HI> and <HI>Muscovites,</HI> seldom venture
far into this Sea, and that only in Summer, is, that
their Barks and Boats are so small and wretchedly
built, that they dare not venture far from the Shoar;
Besides, that this Sea has very few Havens, to wit,
that betwixt the Isle of <HI>Tzenzeni</HI> and the Continent,
near <HI>Terki,</HI> beforementioned, the Havens of <HI>Baku,
Lenkeran</HI> and <HI>Ferebath,</HI> none of the safest; the Ha∣ven
near the City of <HI>Minkischack,</HI> on the side of
the <HI>Grand Tartary,</HI> being the best in this Sea; so that
the Inhabitants bordering upon it, being generally
very bad Seamen, and not well skill'd in the Com∣pass,
it is their own Ignorance, and the Danger of
this Sea, that keeps them near the Shoar, not the
Terror of these Monsters; those other <HI>Europaeans</HI>
that have of late years sail'd deeper into the <HI>Caspian
Sea,</HI> having neither seen nor heard any thing like
it, except they would take the Sea-dogs, which
are in great numbers near the mouth of the <HI>Wolga,</HI>
for such prodigious Monsters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errors of Modern Authors concerning the <HI>Caspi∣an Sea.</HI></NOTE> By the Experience
of those also, it is sufficiently contradlcted what
<HI>Petrejus,</HI> in his History of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> relates with so
much confidence, that the Water of the <HI>Caspian
Sea</HI> is as black as Ink; that it is full of Islands well
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>
stock'd with Inhabitants, and a great number of
Cities and Villages; The Water being of the same
colour with that of all other Seas, and there being
not one Island in it, that has either City or, Village;
and, if the <HI>Persians, Tartars</HI> and <HI>Muscovites</HI> living
thereabouts, may be believ'd, there is only the Isle
of <HI>Ensil</HI> near <HI>Ferebath,</HI> which having very good
Pastures, the Neighbouring Inhabitants, who keep
their Cattle there, have a few Huts to defend them
against the Injuries of the Weather, during the
time their Cattle Grases there. Of the same stamp
is what <HI>Contarinus,</HI> in his Travels, and Father <HI>Bi∣zarous</HI>
in his History of <HI>Persia,</HI> relate concerning a
certain round Fish without a Head, to be found in
this Sea, of an Ell and a half Diameter, of which,
they say, there is drawn a certain Oil, which the
<HI>Persians</HI> use in their Lamps, and to greese their Ca∣mels;
whereas there are at the foot of the Moun∣tain
of <HI>Barmach,</HI> near the City of <HI>Baku,</HI> whole
Rivulets of an Oily substance, by them call'd <HI>Nef∣te,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nefte.</NOTE> which furnish them with a sufficient quantity of
this Kind for that Use, at a much cheaper Rate, it
being from thence transported into the other Parts
of the Kingdom. I am apt to believe that they
are fallen into this Error by the superficial Descri∣ption
of a certain Fish in the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> called
<HI>Naka,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Glut∣ton.</NOTE> or <HI>Glutton,</HI> which has some resemblance to
that mentioned by them; for, it has not only a ve∣ry
short Nose, but the whole Head is, as it was,
within the Belly, and its Tail being round, and its
length and breadth near the same, and some∣times
of six or seven Foot, it comes pretty near a
circular Figure. This Fish will fasten it self with
the Tail under the Fisher-men's Boats, so as to o∣verturn
them, as will also the white Fish, which
makes the Fisher-men be very cautious of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

they put as a Bait upon Iron Hooks, ty'd to good
strong Cords, and so draw him to the Shoar. But
I cannot imagine upon what authority they have
<PB N="49" REF="32" MS="y"/>
founded their Relation, when they say that there
is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other Fish in the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> it being suffi∣ciently
known by Experience, that the <HI>Caspian
Sea</HI> is very well Stor'd not only with abundance of
Salmons, Sturgeons and Herrings, but also with
several Kinds of Fish, as are catch'd in Rivers,
and kept in Ponds, as Barbels, Breams and Trouts.
Before we leave the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> it will perhaps
not be amiss to take notice of a certain Species of
wild Geese, or (rather Cormorants) which are
found in great numbers on that Shoar, especially
towards the mouth of the River <HI>Wolga.</HI> They are
like other Geese as to their Colour, Legs, Neck and
Feet, but the bulk of their Bodies exceeding the
Swans. Their Bills are fork'd at the end, being a
Foot and half long, and near two Inches broad,
the whole Body of some of them being above se∣ven
Foot in length from the Head to the Feet. But
what is most remarkable in them, is, that under
their Bills, they have a shrivell'd Skin hanging, re∣sembling
a Bagg, which, when dilated, contains
more or less three Gallons of Liquor, this they
make use of for a Rescrontory for such Fish they
take, which they afterwards swallow down at
leisure. On the same Shoar is also frequently seen
that kind of Fowl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Onocra∣talus,</NOTE> which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Onocratalus,</HI>
their Beaks are long and round, but at the extre∣mity
flat, in the form of a Spoon beaten out.
When it puts its Beak into the Water, it makes a
most hideous Noise, almost like an Ass, whence,
without doubt it had its Name. I had almost for∣got
to tell you, that the <HI>Caspian Sea</HI> neither Ebbs
nor Flows, which may serve as additional Argu∣ment
to maintain our beforementioned Assertion;
that it has no communication or correspondence
with any other Sea.</P>

of the <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> they have put in
all Places of Strength, not only their Garisons, but
also Governours, Magistrates and Priests, for the
exercise of the Christian Religion. Notwithstand∣ing
this, the <HI>Circassian Tartars</HI> are Govern'd by their
own Princes, Lords and Judges, who administer
Justice in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Name; and, in Matters of
Importance, not without the Presence of the Wey∣wode,
or <HI>Russian</HI> Governour, being all obliged to
take the Oath of Allegiance to his <HI>Czarish Maje∣sty.</HI>
The Men are not unlike the <HI>Nagajan Tartars,</HI>
but not so broad-fac'd, their Hair is black and long,
their Complexion yellowish, they shave the midst
of their Heads, from the Forehead to the Neck,
leaving a small Lock at the Crown. The Women
here are excellently well shap'd, have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only
good Lineaments in their Faces, but also of a clear
and smooth Complexion, which with their black
Hair hanging down in two Tresses on both sides of
their Faces, makes them appear very agreeable.
The <HI>Circassian Tartars</HI> are less barbarous than those
of <HI>Dagesthan,</HI> having in some measure abated from
their former Barbarism,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>Cir∣cassians.</HI></NOTE> since their conversing with
Christians. The Mens Apparel is near the same
with the <HI>Nagajans,</HI> their Caps being only something
larger, their Cloaks being likewise of coarse
Cloath or Sheep-Skins, fastn'd only at the Neck
with a String, which being not large enough
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>
to cover the whole body, they turn it according to
the Wind and Weather. The Women wear
about their Heads a black Coif, cover'd
with a fine white Cloath ty'd under the Chin.
The Widdows have hanging in their Necks an
Ox-bladder full blown, covered with a piece of
Cotton of several colours. The Women wear all
of them, during the Summer, nothing but a Smock
of divers colours, which being cut so deep before,
that one may see down below their Navels, and
their Faces being always uncovered (contrary to
the Custom of those Parts) this, with their good
Humour, and Familiarity they use in Conversation,
makes them very desirable, notwithstanding which,
they have acquired the Reputation of being very
chaste, tho' they seldom want Opportunity of
hornifying their husbands, it being look'd upon as
a piece of common Manners among them, in a Hus∣band,
to go out of the doors, as soon as any body
comes to speak with his Wife; so, that, whether
this Continency of theirs be founded upon their
own Generosity to recompence their Husbands for
the Confidence they put in them, or more upon
Fame than real Truth, we will not pretend to de∣termine
in this Place. Their Language they have
common with the other Neighbouring <HI>Tartars,</HI> tho'
the chief among them are also not ignorant of the
<HI>Muscovian.</HI> They are Pagans; for, tho' the Cere∣mony
of Circumcision is received among them,
yet have they neither Priests, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>choran,</HI> or Churches,
like other <HI>Mahometans;</HI> Every one here offers his
own Sacrifice at pleasure, for which they have some
certain Days, established rather by Custom, than
any positive Commands. The most Solemn Sacri∣fices
they offer at the Death of their nearest Friends,
especially if they be of an Eminent Rank among
them. Upon such an Occasion, both Men and Wo∣men
meet in the Field, to be present at the per∣formance
of the Sacrifice, which is a He-Goat. The
first thing they do, is, to cut off its Privy Members,
which they cast against a Wall, and if they stick
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>
against it, the Goat is judged fit to Sacrifice, if not,
they are obliged to kill another, till such time they
are satisfied in its fitness by the before-mentioned
Tryal; Then they proceed with the Ceremonies,
fleaing it, and stretching the Skin with the Head
and Horns on, upon a Cross on the top of a long
Pole, planted commonly in a Quick-set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge, to
keep the Cattle from it. Near this the Sacrifice is
offered, by boyling and roasting the Flesh, which
they afterwards eat. The Feast being over, the
Men rise, and after having adored the Skin, and
muttered out certain Prayers, the Women with∣draw,
and the Men conclude the whole with drink∣ing
good store of <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> generally to that de∣gree,
that they seldom part without being as drunk
as Beasts, and sometimes not without fighting.
They are very Ceremonious in their Burials, and
adorn their Sepulchres with Pillars. Over those of
Persons of Quality they build certain little Houses,
but only of Wood, the Boards whereof are com∣monly
painted of several colours, and placed Che∣quer-wise,
upon the Roof of which are to be seen
some Statues, but very mean, and sometime some
Pictures, poorly done, representing commonly the
Hunting of some Wild Beast or another.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Dagesthan</HI> inhabit now adays that
part of <HI>Albania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tartars <HI>of</HI> Dagesthan</NOTE> from whence <HI>Thalestris,</HI> the fa∣mous
Queen of the <HI>Amazons</HI> came to give a Visit
to <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> in <HI>Hyrcania,</HI> to obtain that
Kindness, which Ladies, tho' never so desirous of,
seldom care to beg. They inhabit a Tract of
Ground of above 200 Miles, all along the <HI>Caspian</HI>
Sea-shore from, the City of <HI>Derbent,</HI> the utmost
Frontier-Town of <HI>Persia,</HI> on that side, extending
Northward as far as to the River <HI>Bustro</HI> near the
City of <HI>Terki,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Circassia.</HI> They are
called <HI>Dagesthan,</HI> or Mountain <HI>Tartars,</HI> from the
Word <HI>Dag,</HI> which signifies in their Language as
much as a Mountain; because they live between the
Mountains, and in the Plains at the foot of these
Mountains, which are very fruitful and pleasant,
<PB N="54" REF="35"/>
except it be towards the Sea-side, where it is all
Heathy and Barren.</P>
<P>These <HI>Tartars</HI> are generally of a tawny, dark
Complexion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Shape</NOTE> enclining to black; they are very
strong, and well-set in their Limbs, but very ugly
in their Faces, having long black Hair hanging
down over their Shoulders. The Women wear
the Hair ty'd up in a great many Tresses, which
hang down about their Heads, much after the man∣ner
of the <HI>Persians,</HI> but are not kept so much under
Restraint, having their Faces uncovered, and not
being shy of being seen by Strangers. Those who
live towards the Northern part of this Province,
are called <HI>Kaitack,</HI> as those that inhabit the more
Western Parts, are called <HI>Kamuck.</HI></P>
<P>Their Form of Government is that which is most
worth Observation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Go∣vernment.</NOTE> it having a great Resemblance
with those, which in very Antient Times were
established in the Western Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> For,
the whole Country is divided into a great many
Petty Lordships, each of them under the Jurisdi∣ction
of its proper Lord or Myrsa, who, tho' He∣reditary,
is nevertheless not Absolute, but his Au∣thority
controuled by that of some of the chief
Men among them. All these Petty Lords acknow∣ledge
one, whom they call <HI>Schemkal,</HI> for their Su∣pream
Head. He succeeds not by Inheritance, but
by Election. For, after the Death of a <HI>Schemkal,</HI>
all these Petty Lords or Myrsa's meet, and being
set down in a Ring, one of their Priests casts a
Golden Apple among them, the first Person which
is touch'd by this Apple, is their <HI>Schemkal,</HI> to whom,
by common consent, they pay their Respect, but
no absolute Obedience. They are generally very
Barbarous, Savage, and Mischievous, living most
upon Robberies, and exacting Contributions from
the Caravans that pass that way from <HI>Persia.</HI> A
great part of their Livelihood is, for the Men to
steal Children, not sparing even their nearest Re∣lations,
whom they sell to the Neighbouring <HI>Per∣sians,</HI>
leaving the care of their Cattle to their Wives.
<PB N="55" REF="35"/>
They have an odd Custom at their Weddings; to
wit, for every Man there present to shoot his Arrow
into the Floor, where they are left, till they are
rotten, or fall of themselves. They are all <HI>Ma∣hometans,</HI>
using Circumcision, and all other Cere∣monies
of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Their Cloathing is a long close Coat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ha∣bit.</NOTE> commonly
of a dark gray, or black coarse Cloath, over which
they wear a Cloak of the same Stuff, and some∣times
of Sheep's-Skin. They wear a square Cap
sewed together of a great many pieces; their Shooes
being for the most part made of Horses Hides,
sewed only together a-top at the Instep. The
poorest among them is provided with a Coat of
Mail, Head-pice and Buckler, besides a Scymitar,
Javelin, Bow and Arrows.</P>
<P>The Metropolis of the whole Country is the City
of <HI>Tarku,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tarku.</NOTE> situated within the Mountain among
steepy Rocks, which are as hard as Flint, and afford
several most pleasant Springs to the City, which
contains about 1200 Houses, built of Brick-stone
bak'd in the Sun, after the <HI>Persian</HI> manner, but not
so high; It is the Residence of one of their Petty
Princes, but is not surrounded with any Fortifica∣tions,
not so much as a Wall. Next to this, the
most frequented places of this Country are <HI>Rustain,
Boinack,</HI> and <HI>Andre,</HI> being three several Principa∣lities,
lying in the Road betwixt <HI>Persia</HI> and the Ri∣ver
<HI>Wolga.</HI> The Town of <HI>Boinack</HI> is situate upon
the ascent of a steepy Hill near the Sea-side. That
of <HI>Andre</HI> is built upon a rising Ground near the
River <HI>Koisu</HI> (by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call'd <HI>Albanus)</HI> which ri∣ses
out of Mount <HI>Caucasus;</HI> Its Waters are very
muddy, and its Current very swift. The most
Remarkable thing here is a certaing Spring of seeth∣ing
Water, which arising near the Town, and fal∣ling
at some distance into a Pool, makes the Water
fit for Bathing. About some Miles lower, the Ri∣ver
<HI>Koisu</HI> lets out a Branch, by the Inhabitants cal∣led
<HI>Askai</HI> (probably the River <HI>Caesius</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy)</HI>
which running with a very slow Current, at last is
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>
reunited with the said River near the Sea. The
River <HI>Bustro,</HI> mentioned in the beginning of this
Chapter, (known by the name of <HI>Gerrus</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy)</HI>
is the Boundary betwixt the <HI>Circassian</HI> and <HI>Dagest∣han
Tartars;</HI> And, about 25 Miles before its en∣trance
into the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> is divided into two
Branches, the first of which, being called <HI>Terck,</HI> or
<HI>Timenski,</HI> has given the Name to the City of <HI>Terki,</HI>
the Metropolis of <HI>Circassia.</HI> The second Branch is
called <HI>Kiselar,</HI> very near as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad as the other, but
not so deep, being fordable for the most part of the
Summer. But before we leave the Frontiers of the
<HI>Russian</HI> Empire on this side, it may perhaps not be
beyond our scope, to insert here short Description
of the City of <HI>Derbent,</HI> both for its Antiquity's-sake,
and its being the Frontier-Town of <HI>Persia,</HI>
upon the Confines of the <HI>Dagesthan Tartars,</HI> espe∣cially
since we intend to treat of some other Parts,
bordering upon <HI>Muscovy,</HI> in the next following
Chapters.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Derbent</HI> is situate in the Province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Derbent.</NOTE>
called by the <HI>Persians Lengerkunan,</HI> upon the very
Shoar of the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> which sometimes washes
its Walls, under the 41 degr. 51 min. of Latitude.
Its length reaches from East to West, near five
Miles, but its breadth is not proportionable to its
length. It is not only the Frontier-place of <HI>Persia,</HI>
lying upon its utmost Confines on this side, but
may well be called the Gate of it, reaching from
the Mountain quite down to the Sea-shoar. The
whole City is divided into three distinct Quarters;
The first, is the Mid-City, which the <HI>Persians</HI> af∣firm
to be built by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as also that
Wall which surrounds the City on the South-side.
These Walls are of a great height, and about six
Foot broad, and at a distance appear as if they were
built of the best Free-stone in the World; but, ac∣cording
to the Relation of the Inhabitants, the
Stones of it are made of Mussle-shells and small
pieces of Free-stone, beaten and molded together
into Bricks, which, by the long tract of Time, are
<PB N="57" REF="36"/>
reduced to that degree of hardness, as to exceed
Marble it self. There is, even to this day, up∣on
one of the Gates, remaining an Inscription, re∣sembling
the <HI>Syriack▪</HI> Character, as there appears in
another Place some <HI>Arabick</HI> words, but so defaced
by length of Time, as not to be legible. The Castle,
which lies upon the top of the Mountain, is also
related to owe its Foundation to that Great Con∣querour,
and is now always kept by a very good
Garrison of <HI>Persians.</HI> The second Quarter reaches
up to the foot of the Mountain, being the most
Populous, as the lower Town, which reaches to the
Sea-side, is not much frequented now, being formerly
inhabited by <HI>Greeks,</HI> but, ever since the <HI>Persians</HI> re∣gain'd
it from <HI>Mustapha,</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperor, con∣verted
into Gardens. The whole Body of the City
is encompass'd with a very strong Wall, so broad,
that a Waggon may drive on them without Incon∣venience.
The Inhabitants are all <HI>Mahometans,</HI>
except some <HI>Jews,</HI> whose chief Business is to buy
such stoln Children as the Neighbouring <HI>Dagesthan
Tartars</HI> bring thither, or else some <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
which they having pick'd up in some En∣counters,
they send thither to Market, to be from
thence further carried into <HI>Persia.</HI> The Mountain a∣bove
the City, being for the most part covered with
Wood, affords another piece of Antiquity, to wit,
the Ruins of a Wall, which, if the Inhabitants
may be believed, formerly served for a Com∣munication
betwixt the <HI>Caspian</HI> and <HI>Euxin</HI> Seas,
and extended it self near 300 Miles in length.
Thus much is ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain, that in the Ruins ap∣pear
now in some places six foot high, in some
others two or three, the Tract being quite lost in
others; And, on some of the adjacent Hills are to
be seen the Ruins of several old Castles of a four
square Form, two of which remain unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh'd
to this day, and are Garison'd by the <HI>Persians.</HI>
There is a remarkable Monument of another kind
near this City, to wit, the Sepulchre of <HI>Tzumtzume,</HI>
of whom the <HI>Persians</HI> relate the following Fable
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>
out of their Poet, <HI>Fiesull:</HI> They relate, that <HI>Essi</HI>
(this being the Name they give to our Saviour)
coming into those Parts, found thereabouts a cer∣tain
Dead Man's Skul, which having taken par∣ticular
Notice of, he desired of God, whose Fa∣vourite
he was, to bring the deceased Person to
Life again; which being done accordingly, <HI>Essi</HI>
then asked him, who he was; he answered, that
his Name was <HI>Tzumtzume,</HI> that he had been the
most Powerful King of that Country, where he
had kept a vast Court, composed of a great many
Thousands Musicians, Pages, and other Servants.
At last <HI>Tzumtzume,</HI> having asked <HI>Essi,</HI> who he was,
and what Religion he professed, Christ made an∣swer,
I am <HI>Essi,</HI> and by the Religion I profess, all
the World is to be saved. If this be true, reply'd
<HI>Tzumtzume,</HI> I declare my self for that Religion,
but desire that I may die immediately, being un∣willing
to live now without Subjects in a place
where I was so powerful before. <HI>Essi</HI> having
granted his Request, he died instantly, and his Se∣pulchre
remains here to be seen to this day, un∣der
a Tree of an extraordinary bigness, next ad∣joyning
to which is a Scaffold erected of ten Foot
high, and sixteen Square. On the other side of the
City are to be seen some Thousands of Tombs,
cover'd with Stones, half round, Cylinder-wise,
but exceeding the ordinary Stature of Men, have∣ing
all of them <HI>Arabick</HI> Inscriptions. It is report∣ed,
that in former Ages, yet since the Time of
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> there was a certain King in <HI>Media,</HI>
named <HI>Kassan,</HI> who being engag'd in War against
the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Dagesthan,</HI> received there a signal
Overthrow, and caused the Bodies of the Officers
killed in this Battle to be buried in these Tombs.
The Relation seems to be not altogether fictitious,
there being near the Sea-side, at some distance from
the rest, forty others, exceeding the before-men∣tioned
Tombs in bigness, and encompass'd with a
Wall, which having each its Banner, are said to be
the Sepulchres of so many Lords of the first Rank,
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
and other Holy Men, that came along with them,
where the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> of both Sexes come
to pay their Devotions by kissing these Sepulchres,
and laying their Hands upon them, while they are
at Prayers. But it is time to return to the <HI>Tarta∣rians,</HI>
under the Grand Czar's Obedience, and a∣mong
them, to say something of the Province of
<HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>This Province which lies quite Northward from
<HI>Muscovy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siberia.</NOTE> betwixt the Provinces of <HI>Obdora</HI> and <HI>Ju∣goria,</HI>
bordering towards the North upon the <HI>Sa∣mojedes,</HI>
is of a great extent, but not very popu∣lous,
being inhabited by <HI>Tartars.</HI> Its Capital City,
being also the Seat of an Archbishop, is <HI>Tobol,</HI>
built upon a rising Ground, near a small River;
and, except some <HI>Muscovites,</HI> inhabited by <HI>Tartars.</HI>
On the Frontiers of the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI> is the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Daour;</HI> And far beyond <HI>Tobol</HI> is <HI>Chnesortski,</HI>
the chief place of Commerce in the whole Pro∣vince
for Sables, and other sorts of Firrs, the Pro∣ducts
of this Country. The Natives are a poor
and wretched sort of People, notwithstanding that
they have in some Parts good Corn Fields, and
great Store of Fish. But the chief and most pre∣cious
Commodity of this Country, besides other
Furrs, are the Skins of Sables. These Animals they
catch either with Traps, not unlike to those we
catch our Rats with; or by spreading of Nets un∣der
the Trees, where they feed, which being cut
down, they are entangled in the Nets; In the
Winter they have also a Way of hunting them
with Dogs. They were formerly Pagans, being
Govern'd by their own Czar or King, till near 150
Years ago, they were subdu'd by Czar <HI>Jobn Basilo∣vits</HI>
in the following manner: A certain Famous
Pirate among the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> living near the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Jormack Timorhof,</HI> having
taken a Ship loaden with Amunition, and belong∣ing
to the <HI>Czar,</HI> was for fear of being pursued and
discovered, fled for Shelter into a certain Island,
near the River <HI>Kama,</HI> which coming from <HI>Permia</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>
(one of the Northern Provinces of <HI>Muscovy)</HI> falls
below <HI>Casan</HI> into the River <HI>Wolga.</HI> This Island
belonging then to a certain <HI>Muscovian</HI> Merchant,
he proposed to him no less than the Conquest of
some of those <HI>Tartarian</HI> Countreys, lying more to∣wards
the North; and being furnished by him with
Arms, Ammunition, and other Necessaries, he, with
about five or six hundred of his Followers went up
the River <HI>Tagit,</HI> and from thence to the River <HI>Tu∣ra,</HI>
where having possess'd himself of a small I∣sland,
called <HI>Japouchin,</HI> he march'd from thence to
the City of <HI>Tumen,</HI> which he also took without
much opposition. Being flush'd with this Success,
he directed his March streight ways to <HI>Tobol,</HI> the
M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tropolis of the Province, and then the Resi∣dence
of the <HI>Siberian</HI> King, where having also met
with very little Resistance, he soon became Master
of the Place: But being not contented with thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
extraordinary Success, and proposing to himself no
less than the Conquest of the whole Province, he
lost soon after both his Life and Conquests. For,
having pursued the flying Enemy a great way be∣yond
the City of <HI>Tobol,</HI> all along the River <HI>Irtish,
300</HI> of his Men, whom he had sent out on purpose,
to Atrack the Enemy at a certain pass, being drawn
into an Ambush, were all kill'd upon the Spot, so,
that <HI>Jormack</HI> with the rest, being about 200, was
forced to retire into a small Island there abouts,
where he Entrench'd himself as well as he could.
But the <HI>Tartars</HI> having by their late Victory, got
new Courage, and being informed of what num∣ber
of Men he had with him, Attack'd him
by Night, where he with all his Followers, except
40, who found means to get into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> were
either drowned or cut to pieces. The remnants of
<HI>Jormack</HI>'s Party, being at last come to the City of
<HI>Musco,</HI> and having given to the Czar a relation of
what had past in <HI>Siberia,</HI> it was thought advisable
to give them some Forces, thereby to enable them
to try their Fortune a second time. Having there∣fore
obtained 600 Men, with Amunition, and other
<PB N="61" REF="38" MS="y"/>
Necessaries suitable to such an Expedition, they
marched directly towards the City of <HI>Tobol,</HI> the
Metropolis and Residence of the Prince of <HI>Siberia;</HI>
and having a second time possess'd themselves of it
without much opposition, they took quite other
measures to secure their Conquests, from what <HI>Jor∣mack</HI>
had done before; for they so strongly fortified
themselves there, that they soon were beyond all
apprehension of being Attack'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and
being afterwards reinforced with new Supplies of
Men, and other Necessaries, by their frequent
Incursions so fatigu'd the Neighbouring <HI>Tartars,</HI>
that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to submit themselves under
the Czar's Protection; tho' it is not altogether im∣probable,
but that the Necessity of vending their
Sables and other Furrs to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> might be
their Chief Motive of surrendring themselves un∣der
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Subjection. Since which
time, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> have built in these Parts se∣veral
Cities, fortified after the <HI>Russiian</HI> Fashion;
and much imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oved others, as <HI>Narim,</HI> and the
great City of <HI>Tooina,</HI> on the other side of the Ri∣ver
<HI>Oby;</HI> The Castle of <HI>Comgoscoi,</HI> upon the River
<HI>Telta,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Since the Conquest of <HI>Siberia,</HI> it is chiefly to the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> we are beholding for the particular
Discovery they have made of that vast Extent of
the Northern Countreys, that lie betwixt the Ri∣ver
<HI>Oby</HI> (which traverses this Province, and has
been mentioned before) and the Famous <HI>Chinese</HI>
Wall, which divides that Famous Empire from the
<HI>Grand Tartary.</HI> For the <HI>Muscovites</HI> having once
been made sensible of the prodigious Quantities of
all Sorts of precious Furrs, as the Sables, Martins and
black Foxes those Countreys afforded, and the vast
Profit that must needs arise to their own Country,
by engrossing the Traffick of those Commodities,
have left no stone unturn'd, not only to make the
best Discovery they could of those <HI>Tartarian</HI> Na∣tions,
but also by settling a fair Correspondence
with them, to open to themselves a free passage
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>
into <HI>China.</HI> Among the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Nations which
inhabit that vast Tract of Ground betwixt <HI>Siberia</HI>
and <HI>China,</HI> the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Calmuck,</HI> of <HI>Mongul</HI> and
<HI>Bogdoi,</HI> are the most considerable, whether for the
extent of the Countreys they inhabit, or the pro∣digious
number of their Inhabitants. The first
discovery of these Parts has chiefly been owing to
the Industry of those employed by the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
in Sable Hunting, whom they in their Language
call <HI>Yachutehiki,</HI> or <HI>Hunters of Sable Martins;</HI> These
are for the most part, composed not only out of
Malefactors or Criminals, but also out of some
Officers or Boyars, who for some reason or another,
having fall'n under the <HI>Grand Czar</HI>'s Displeasure, and
being banished into those places where these Crea∣tures
are caught, the hopes of Gains has by degrees
drawn them further and further after the Search of
these Creatures, even as far as the River <HI>Yamour,</HI>
where, for their better Conveniency, the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
not many years ago, have built a Fort in a certain
Island of that River, which has occasioned no small
Contests betwixt them and the <HI>Chinese.</HI> Besides
the two ways of catching these Creatures by the
Trap and Net, mentioned before, they observe this
Method in these remote Parts: There is a certain
number of Men Arm'd with Cross-bows, engag'd
for this Service, during the space of seven Years,
and divided under certain Officers; One of these
Officers goes abroad, at least once a Week with his
Hunters and Dogs in Search after these precious
Creatures, which commonly are lurking among the
little Islands, which they kill with their Cross-Bows,
not making use of any Fire-arms, for fear
of endamaging the Furrs; What is thus caught is all
for the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Use, except a certain Allowance,
the Officers have for their Pains, which however,
they are obliged to divide in proportion with their
Huntsmen, to encourage them in prosecuting the
Game with the utmost diligence; The eagerness
after which has at last opened to them the Know∣ledge
of those several Roads, which insensibly
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>
have led them to the very Borders of <HI>China.</HI> But
we will return to those <HI>Tartarian</HI> Nations, and be∣gin
with the <HI>Tartars Calmucks,</HI> or <HI>Calmouches.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Tartars</HI> inhabit a vast extent of Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Tar∣tars Cal∣mucks.</NOTE>
between the two Rivers of <HI>Volga</HI> and <HI>Jaika</HI> extend∣ing
from <HI>Astrachan</HI> towards the <HI>Caspian Sea,</HI> and
bordering upon the Country of the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mon∣gul.</HI>
They are divided into an infinite number of
<HI>Hordes▪</HI> every one under their particular <HI>Chan</HI> or
<HI>Kan,</HI> who all of them acknowledge the Authority
of one, who is their Principal <HI>Chan;</HI> he is called
<HI>Otchicurtican,</HI> and derives his Pedegree from the
Great <HI>Tamerlan.</HI> He is a very Potent Prince, and
lives in very great Splendor, being formidable both
to the Neighbouring <HI>Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Muscovites</HI> them∣selves;
the latter of which keep a considerable
Garison at <HI>Saratof,</HI> on the River <HI>Volga,</HI> to hinder
their Excursions on that side; and during the Win∣ter
Season, are obliged to furnish the <HI>Nagajan Tar∣tars</HI>
about <HI>Astrachan,</HI> with Arms to defend them∣selves
against the Inroads of these <HI>Tartars.</HI> For∣merly
they used to come every Winter to ravage
the Country of the <HI>Nagajans,</HI> but since these by the
assistance of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> have made them sensi∣ble
of the effects of their Fire-Arms and Canons,
they content themselves with coming once a Year
in the great Plains of <HI>Astrachan,</HI> for the conveni∣ency
of Food for their Cattle, at a Season, when
the more Northern parts, which they inhabit, are
quite destitute of it. This is commonly done with
no less than a hundred thousand Men, and they
seldom return without having received their usual
Present of Bread, Aqua-vitae and Tobacco, from
the Governour of <HI>Astrachan.</HI> There is no question
to be made, but that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> are powerful
enough to curb the Insolency of these Vagabonds,
if it were not out of a consideration of the Bene∣fit
they receive from the Traffick of their Furrs and
Horses, which they bring in great Quantities to
<HI>Astrachan,</HI> and that they are very serviceable to the
<HI>Czar</HI> in his Wars, being accounted the nimblest a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>
Encamping and Decamping in the World, as be∣ing
accustomed to it by the frequent Incursions
they make into all the Neighbouring Countreys.
It is chiefly for this Reason, that the <HI>Muscovites.</HI>
look'd upon it as a piece of Policy, rather to allay
their Fierceness by some Presents (which however,
by continuance of Time, they now demand as an
Obligation) than to engage in a War against a
Multitude of Vagabonds, who have nothing to
loose; they having no Houses or fix'd Habitations,
much less any Cities, but living Winter and Sum∣mer
in Tents, made of Felts, in which however,
both for neatness and conveniency, they exceed all
the Neighbouring Nations, even those that have
settled Habitations. These as well as all the other
Nations of <HI>Great Tartary,</HI> even to the <HI>Indies,</HI> are
Pagans, except those of <HI>Bokara</HI> and <HI>Samarkand,</HI>
who are Mahometans. All the rest of the Pagan
Nations acknowledge for the Supream Head of
their Religion, in the same, if not in a more ab∣solute
manner as the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> do the <HI>Pope,</HI>
a certain High Priest, whom they call <HI>Dalae-Lama,</HI>
or <HI>Lamalamalow.</HI></P>
<P>The constant Residence of this Impostor is in a
very strong Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pagan Pope.</NOTE> near the City of <HI>Barantola</HI> in
the <HI>Tarturian</HI> Province of <HI>Tanchut,</HI> which reaches
from the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Calmuck</HI> and <HI>Mongul,</HI> between
<HI>China</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and is Govern'd by
a great Prince, whom they call <HI>Deva.</HI> This Pa∣gan
Pope, the spiritual Father of the whole <HI>Great
Tartary,</HI> is worshipped by these Idolatrous Nations,
by prostrating themselves before him, and adoring
him, like a God; neither are any Strangers permit∣ted
to approach him, unless they are ready to pay
him the same Devotion. The <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves
shew a great deal of Veneration to him, and when∣ever
he vouchafes to come into <HI>China,</HI> he is receiv∣ed
with the greatest Respect and Honour imagina∣ble,
and never returns without vast Presents. He
has his Vicars or Vicegerents residing in several of
the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Provinces, unto whom they pay the
<PB N="65" REF="40" MS="y"/>
same Adoration, as to the <HI>Dalaè-Lama,</HI> or <HI>Lama∣malamalow</HI>
himself; These Patriarchs, or what else
you will call them, are by the <HI>Tartarians</HI> called
<HI>Coutusta Lamas,</HI> and assume among other Preroga∣tives,
an Authority to themselves of composing
such Differences, as may arise among the Under
Chans, either by themselves, or by such Judges as
they are pleased to appoint. The chief thing
which contributes towards the maintaining the great
Veneration these Pagans have for the <HI>Dalaè-Lama,</HI>
is, that they have been persuaded into a Belief,
that he is immortal, and only renews, like the
Moon. This Impostor is carried on in the follow∣ing
manner: As soon as they perceive this <HI>Dalaè</HI> or
Chief Priest, to be in danger of his Life, those that
have the management of this Business, make it
their whole care to find out among the other <HI>La∣ma</HI>'s
or Vicars, one who most resembles him in
Person; who, immediately after the Death of the
first (whose dead Body is carefully concealed) is
set up in his Room, and declared to be the same
<HI>Dalaè-Lama,</HI> but only renewed in his Person; and
this Impostor is the more difficult to be discovered,
by the common People, they being but rarely al∣low'd
to see this High Priest, unless it be at a di∣stance,
when he gives them his Benediction.</P>
<P>I cannot but take notice here of the Opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preste Jean.</NOTE>
which some, that have of late years travell'd into
those Parts, have conceived of this <HI>Dalaè-Lama,</HI>
to wit, That he is that same <HI>Preste Jean,</HI> who has
made so much noise in the World, and has been
so variously represented by Historians. Thus much
is certain, that if every thing be duely weighed as
it ought to be, concerning the Title and other
Things, which by many Authors are attributed to
their <HI>Preste Jean,</HI> the same may in most points be
said of this <HI>Dalaè-Lama;</HI> so, that I see no reason
why we may not with more Justice place him in
<HI>Asia,</HI> than these Authors have look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for him in <HI>A∣byssina,</HI>
where, with all their Endeavours and Shifts,
they have never been able to find him out hitherto.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="41"/>
The <HI>Portugeses</HI> were the first that received, and
afterwards communicated this erroneous Opi∣nion
to the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> it being certain,
that the more an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient Authors, who have made
any mention of this <HI>Preste Jean,</HI> have placed him
always in <HI>Asia,</HI> though they have differed both
as to his Name, and place of Residence.
And thus far <HI>Baltazar Tellez, Nicolas Godigno,</HI> and
some others, who have been for a considerable time
resident in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and consequently had the bet∣ter
Opportunity to be inform'd concerning this
Matter, agree with the Antients, that this <HI>Preste
Jeen</HI> is not to be heard of in those Parts. The <HI>Por∣tugeses</HI>
were first led into this Error by one <HI>Pieter
de Coulan,</HI> who being sent by their King <HI>John</HI> II. to
discover the <HI>East-Indies</HI> by Land, after having tra∣versed
a great part of <HI>Asia</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> could
not hear the least Tidings there of this so Famous
<HI>Preste Jean;</HI> But, in his return homeward, com∣ing
to <HI>Cairo,</HI> was inform'd, that in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> there
was a very Potent Prince, who was a declared Pro∣tector
of the Christians, having always a Cross car∣ried
before him. This Relation agreeing in a great
measure with what had been published before con∣cerning
<HI>Preste Jean,</HI> was the sooner received as
Authentick, first, in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and afterwards all
over <HI>Europe.</HI> The Jesuit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Kirker,</HI> has shewn us
out of the <HI>Latin Chronology▪</HI> of the Kings of <HI>Abys∣sina,</HI>
That there is not the least mention made there
of this <HI>Preste Jean;</HI> and if we search narrowly in∣to
the Antient Authors, that have had occasion to
speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, we shall find that the greatest part
of them have placed him betwixt the Country of
the <HI>Monguls</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> tho' perhaps in several Pro∣vinces;
which difference might perhaps arise from
thence, that in former Ages this <HI>Preste Jean</HI> had
his several Vicars, as the <HI>Dalaè-Lama</HI> has now,
which might be taken by some for the Head it self.
St. <HI>Antonius,</HI> in the third Tome of his History, places
this <HI>Preste Jean</HI> in the <HI>Greater</HI> or <HI>Ʋpper India,</HI> from
whence, he says, he drove back the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that
<PB N="67" REF="41"/>
invaded the Christians in those Parts. Those who
have assign'd him his Reign in <HI>Kitay,</HI> have question∣less
comprehended that vast Country, situate betwixt
the Rivers of <HI>Volga</HI> and the <HI>Oby,</HI> as far as <HI>China,</HI>
under that Name, as the <HI>Muscovites</HI> do to this day;
especially since <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</HI> who resided
several Years with the <HI>Great Chan</HI> of the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
places <HI>Preste Jean</HI> in the same Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut,</HI>
where the <HI>Dalaè-Lama</HI> has his Residence to this
day. Both the Antient and Modern Authors have
been strangely puzzled in finding out the true Ety∣mology
of the Word <HI>Preste Jean,</HI> but in my Opi∣nion,
that of <HI>Scaliger</HI> is the most probable, who
derives it from the <HI>Persian</HI> Word <HI>Prestegiani,</HI> which
signifies as much as <HI>Apostolick,</HI> and might easily by
Corruption be transformed into <HI>Preste Jean</HI> by such
of the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> as did not understand its true sig∣nification.
There is but two Objections of any
moment to be made against this Assertion: The
first is, that the same <HI>Preste Jean,</HI> who is so much
celebrated throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> and his Subjects,
were Christians; whereas the People Inhabiting now
adays the <HI>Great Tartary,</HI> are Idolaters; The second
is, that <HI>Preste Jean</HI> was a Temporal Prince. As to
the first, it is to be observed, that, tho' at present
that vast Country is altogether possess'd by Infidels
or Pagans, nevertheless it is very probable, that
in more Antient Times, the Christian Religion
was introduced into those Parts as well as others,
and continued there for a considerable time, there
being certain Remnants of Christianity to be met
with to this day, among some of its Inhabitants.
There is a Country in those Parts, called by the
<HI>Moors</HI> in derision, <HI>Kiaferstan,</HI> that is, <HI>The Country
of the Infidels,</HI> the Inhabitants of which are called
to this day, <HI>Christians of</HI> St. <HI>Thomas;</HI> and, tho' no Chri∣stians
now, yet have retain'd Baptism for their Chil∣dren,
have painted Crosses in their Churches, and
bear three Red Crosses, made with the Tincture of
Sanders-Wood, in their Foreheads. I think it is
almost beyond question, that in the thirteenth Age,
<PB N="68" REF="42"/>
there was a vast number of Christians in <HI>Tartary,</HI>
their Emperor <HI>Cublai,</HI> having embraced the Christian
Religion, and his Brother waged War with great
Success against the <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> and other In∣fidels.
In the fourteenth Age several of <HI>Franciscan</HI>
Monks, who were sent to the Great <HI>Chan,</HI> conver∣ted
in the Kingdom of <HI>Thibet</HI> (which is next to
that of <HI>Tanchut)</HI> a great number of Pagans; and
it is Remarkable, what F. <HI>Andrada,</HI> a <HI>Portugese</HI>
Jesuit relates, That in the Year 1624. when he tra∣vell'd
in those Parts, he found among the Inhabi∣tants
some corrupted Idea's of Christianity; as a
certain sort of Confession of that Christian Faith,
their Ancestors had profess'd in former Ages. And
I think it no less worth Observation, that this <HI>Dalaè</HI>
or High-Priest of the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> bears the Name
of <HI>Lama,</HI> which in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Language signi∣fies
a Cross, and that the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI> who
acknowledge among the rest the Authority of this
<HI>Dalaè,</HI> wear always Crosses about them, which they
call <HI>Lama's,</HI> and keep them with a great deal of
Reverence. As to the second Objection, of this
<HI>Dalaè</HI> not being a Temporal Prince now, this may
be ascribed to the Wars and Revolutions of a Coun∣try
inhabited by several distinct Nations, so as be∣ing
first corrupted, and at last quite degenerated
from their Antient Religion into a Barbarous Ido∣latry,
and thereby the whole face of Affairs changed;
this Successor of <HI>Preste Jean,</HI> from being a Monarch,
might become the Head of a New Religion, or
rather Idolatry.</P>
<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tartars of Mongul.</NOTE> it is time, after this Digression, to proceed
in the Description of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Provinces be∣tween
<HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and among them to the
<HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mongul.</HI> These <HI>Tartars</HI> inhabit a very
large Tract of Ground from the Western sources
of the River <HI>Yamour</HI> to the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI> from
whom they are however separated by great Desarts,
and border to the South-East and East upon <HI>Tur∣questan</HI>
and <HI>China.</HI> They are subdivided into three
great Provinces, each of them being under the Ju∣risdiction
<PB N="69" REF="42"/>
of its particular <HI>Chan</HI> or <HI>Taiso,</HI> who are
all three of the same Family, and cultivate a very
good Understanding betwixt one another, having
several Under-<HI>Chans</HI> under their Jurisdiction. The
first and chiefest of these <HI>Chans</HI> is call'd <HI>Tchetchinga,</HI>
his Territories lie betwixt <HI>China</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> of
<HI>Bogdoi.</HI> They inhabit neither Towns nor Villages,
their Houses, which are but few in number, lying
scattered here and there, without any regularity.
They are very troublesom to their Neighbours in∣habiting
about the Lake <HI>Dalai,</HI> and all along the
River <HI>Szelinga;</HI> one of their Under-<HI>Chans,</HI> call'd
<HI>Becroesain,</HI> Territories bordering upon that River.
It is in the Territories of this <HI>Chan Tchetchinga,</HI> that
the <HI>Coutousta Lama,</HI> or the Vicar of the <HI>Dalaè Lama,</HI>
has his Residence, being respected here as the Pa∣triarch
of all the <HI>Monguls,</HI> and adored almost like
a Deity. He follows them where-ever they ramble,
and it is to him they refer the decision of all their
Differences; these <HI>Tartars</HI> being naturally of a
very mild and pliable Temper. The second of the
Principal <HI>Chans,</HI> is called <HI>Octiervikan,</HI> and the third,
<HI>D' Jan Gari,</HI> but their Territories lying out of the
way of Commerce, and consequently being unfre∣quented
by Strangers, are nothing near so well
known as the first. They are very jealous of the
<HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI> since they have made themselves
Masters of <HI>China,</HI> but these stand in little fear of
them, as having the Advantage of their Fire-Arms
against them, with the use of which the <HI>Monguls</HI>
are altogether unacquainted; and the Desarts be∣twixt
them and the <HI>Calmucks</HI> or <HI>Calmuches,</HI> serve
for a Barrier to both Nations. They keep a very
good Correspondence with the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> by rea∣son
of the Neighbourhood of <HI>Siberia,</HI> where they
drive a great Trade with the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> especially
in Cattle, wherein their chiefest Wealth consists,
their Country being all over watered with a great
number of small Rivers, which all empty them∣selves
into the River <HI>Szelinga,</HI> and render their
Meadows extreamly fertile and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for Pasturage.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="43"/>
The <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tartars <HI>of</HI> Bogdoi.</NOTE> by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> called
the <HI>Eastern Tartars,</HI> inhabit a vast Country, divi∣ded
under the Jurisdiction of several Chans or
Tayso's; but the Province, called, <HI>Diutchari</HI> by
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> whose Inhabitants conquer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>China,</HI>
makes them the most Famous of all the rest of the
<HI>Tartars.</HI> This Province lies betwixt the Eastern
Seas, and the two great Rivers, <HI>Chingala</HI> and <HI>Ya∣mour.</HI>
They were formerly so inconsiderable, as to
be Tributaries to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> till they made them∣selves
both known and fear'd, by subduing six of
the <HI>Chinese</HI> Provinces; and would in all likelihood,
have soon made themselves Masters of the whole
Empire at that time, had not the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd in to
their Aid the <HI>Yousbecks,</HI> who having expell'd the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI> did not only settle themselves there,
but also put upon the Throne the Family of <HI>Ive∣na;</HI>
which having sway'd the Scepter of this spa∣cious
Empire, till the Year 1368, was expell'd by
the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and the Imperial Diadem bestow'd up∣on
the Family of <HI>Tayminga.</HI> After this Family had
reign'd very peaceably for near the space of 300
Years, the same <HI>Diutchari</HI> or <HI>Bogdoi Tartars,</HI> in the
Year 1644, re-entred <HI>China</HI> with a vast Army, and
at last, reduced the whole Empire, under their O∣bedience.
The first Emperour of the <HI>Tartarian</HI>
Race, was <HI>Chunchi</HI> their Prince, the Chief of the
Family of <HI>Taitsingva,</HI> who reigns at present in
<HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI> as also the Inhabi∣tants
of the Province <HI>Dauri</HI> are not near so rich in
Cattle as the <HI>Monguls,</HI> their Horses being but very
small, and never Shoo'd by their Owners, but
they drive a considerable Trade in Sables and black
Foxes Skins, as also in Rubies and Pearls, which
the Rivers, <HI>Argus, Yamour</HI> and <HI>Chingala,</HI> afford
them. Their Houses are built of nothing but
Earth, and they resemble both in their Stature and
Faces most of the <HI>Europaean Tartars,</HI> but especially
those of <HI>Crim,</HI> except that they are much more ci∣vilised,
by reason of their continual Commerce
with the <HI>Chineses.</HI> Their Speech and the Characters
<PB N="71" REF="43"/>
they make use of, have a very near resemblance to
the Vulgar Dialect of the <HI>Persians,</HI> but they have
above sixty Letters in their Alphabet, and write
and read from the top downward, like the <HI>Chineses.</HI>
They scarce profess any certain Religion, but wear
most of them Crosses, which they keep in great
Veneration, and are great Enemies of the <HI>Maho∣metans.</HI>
Both Guns, and Gun-powder is in use
among them; but not so frequently, neither with
the same Dexterity, as in <HI>Europe,</HI> they having not
attain'd to the same perfection in the Composition
of the latter, so, that it being but of little Strength,
and their Great Artillery, which is very indifferent∣ly
cast, not very suitable to their rambling way of
living, they more frequently make use of the same
Arms as the rest of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these three different Sorts of <HI>Tartars,</HI> we
have spoken of, there are several others, as the <HI>To∣stiouski,
Watski,</HI> or <HI>Vigulci, Barbanski</HI> or <HI>Scibanski,
Tyrgyski, Tingoesi,</HI> and others, who inhabit about
the Lakes, and all along the Rivers between <HI>Siberia</HI>
and the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mongul.</HI> They most of them
agree in Physiognomy and Language with the <HI>Cal∣muck
Tartars,</HI> so, that in all probability they are so
many separate <HI>Hordes,</HI> formerly belonging to that
Nation, but by conversation and trading with the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> at last brought over to the Jurisdiction
of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tingoeses</HI> were first discovered to the <HI>Russians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tingoeses</NOTE>
in the Year 1605, when some of the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Hunters, guided by some <HI>Siberian Tartars,</HI> and a
few <HI>Samoyedes</HI> (of whom we shall speak at large in
the following Chapter) after having pass'd many
Rivers and several Desarts, came at last to a River,
called <HI>Jenissay</HI> (where the <HI>Muscovites</HI> have since
built a City of the same name) exceeding in big∣ness
the River <HI>Oby</HI> it self, which having on the East
high Mountains (some of which cast out Fire) and
on the West very fertile Plains, these were the Ha∣bitations
of the <HI>Tingoesi,</HI> living in wretched Cot∣tages,
disposed into several small <HI>Hordes</HI> or Compa∣nies.
<PB N="72" REF="44"/>
The River overflows the adjacent Plains in
the Spring, during which time, the Inhabitants re∣tire
into the Mountains, and return to the Plains
with their Cattle, as soon as the Waters are fall'n:
They found them of a very gentle and mild Dis∣position,
having at the persuasion of the <HI>Samoyedes,</HI>
soon submitted themselves to the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Go∣vernment;
but, what is very observable, is, that
these <HI>Tartarians</HI> have great swoln Throats, like in
<HI>Italy,</HI> the Inhabitants under the <HI>Alpes.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Tartars</HI> in those Parts are of a swarthy
Complexion, inclining to an Olive colour: They
have broad Faces, flat below, but rising on the up∣per-part,
their Eyes very small, but brisk and
sparkling; they have very short and flat Noses,
wearing a little Hair upon their upper Lips or Chins.
The Stature and Proportion of their Bodies is very
large, something above the common Size,
they are clean and well proportion'd in their
Limbs; their Air, tho' somewhat stern and reso∣lute,
yet carries not any marks of Cruelty or Sa∣vageness
along with it. Their Habits resemble that
of most all the other <HI>Tartars,</HI> both <HI>Europaeans</HI> and
<HI>Asiaticks,</HI> being made in the nature of a Cassock
or large Vest, fitted to their Bodies, but the Ma∣terials
are for the most part only Sheep-Skins. A∣bout
the Waste they wear a Cord or small Girdle,
wherein hangs their Bow and Quiver, which are
their constant Companions, wherever they go.
Their Heads are shav'd to the Crown, where they
preserve a good Tuft of Hair, thick enough to make
two good Locks, one of which hangs down before,
the other behind. Upon their Heads they were no
other Covering, than a round Cap, or rather Bon∣net,
made of the same Stuff with their Habits;
only that on the top of it, there is a pretty large
Tuft of red, white or green Silk, or perhaps of
some other colour, according to the Custom of
such <HI>Hordes,</HI> as they belong to; these <HI>Hordes</HI> wear∣ing
these different colour'd Tufts, as a certain
mark, whereby to distinguish themselves from one
<PB N="73" REF="44"/>
another. Their Chief Men among them, especially
such as live in those places where the Sables and
Martins are caught, make their Garments either of
those Furrs, or else of Dog-Skins, and sometimes,
especially during the Winter, they join both toge∣ther.
They generally wear the Hair of the Dogs (of
which they keep a great number) outermost mak∣ing
the Furrs of the Sables or Martins the Lining to
the other; not, but that they are sufficiently sensi∣ble,
how much the first exceed the latter, both in
Beauty and Value; but, say they, <HI>We do not think
it just, that the Dog, who in his life-time had been so
serviceable to us, in finding out and catching the Sa∣bles
or Martins, should be debased after his death, be∣low
those he conquer'd, but that his past Service ought
to be remembered, by preferring him after his death be∣fore
his enemy, which he vanquished when alive.</HI></P>
<P>It is easie to be imagined, that the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
after they had hunted out these so far distant Coun∣tries,
did not acquiesce here, but left no Stone un∣turned
till they had made themselves an easie Pas∣sage
through those <HI>Tartarian</HI> Countries to the Em∣pires
of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI> To obtain this end, they
used to send frequently their Ambassadors, and
sometimes Messengers on some Pretence or another,
into those Parts, who having taken several ways,
at last made the Passage betwixt the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire
and <HI>China</HI> tolerably commodious to their Merchants,
who now Travel from the City of <HI>Musco</HI> to <HI>Pekin,</HI>
the Capital City of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Empire, in less than
Four Months time, with Conveniency enough,
especially since the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> for the conveniency
of their <HI>Caravans,</HI> have built several Cities and
Forts, as the City of <HI>Genessay</HI> or <HI>Jenessay,</HI> among the
<HI>Tingoëses,</HI> upon the River of that Name; The City
of <HI>Szelinga,</HI> upon the River of the same Name,
besides several Fortresses, the last of which is called
<HI>Albazin,</HI> built upon the River <HI>Yamour,</HI> three Months
Journey from the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and but three
Weeks Travelling from <HI>Pekin,</HI> the Metropolis of
<HI>China.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="45"/>
When the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Merchants undertake this
great Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Travel in∣to <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> they commonly take the Advantage
of the Winter-Season, which being the most com∣modious
in <HI>Muscovy</HI> for Travelling, by reason of
the Rivers and Lakes (which in the Summer-time
are no small Obstacles to Travellers) being all
frozen over, they usually set out towards the latter
end of <HI>February,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> when
the Snow being well beaten, they Travel in Sleds
from the City of <HI>Musco</HI> to <HI>Tobol,</HI> the Capital City
of <HI>Siberia,</HI> to wit, above 800 <HI>English</HI> Miles in less
than three Weeks. From hence they continue their
Journey by Land to the utmost Frontie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <HI>Siberia,</HI>
and from thence to the <HI>Tostiouski,</HI> a <HI>Horde</HI> of <HI>Tartars,</HI>
under the Subjection of the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> Here they
change their Carriage (which they send back into
<HI>Siberia)</HI> for one much more swift and commodious.
For whereas the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Sleds are usually drawn
but by one Horse, they make use in those Parts of
a certain Beast, called the <HI>Reen,</HI> or <HI>Rain-Deer,</HI> which
they put in their Sleds, and to make it go the more
swift, they tye a great Dog behind, that by his bark∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reen, or Rain-Deer.</NOTE>
scaring the poor Beast, makes it run with that
swiftness, that it carries the Sleds Six or Sevenscore
Miles a day.</P>
<P>This Creature (probably the <HI>Tarandius</HI> of the
Antients) is by the Modern <HI>Latins</HI> called <HI>Rangifer,</HI>
from the Word <HI>Reen,</HI> which is the Name given it
by the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> who, as likewise the <HI>Samoyedes,</HI>
and some other Northern Nations, make a conside∣rable
Advantage of these Beasts, not only in their
Sleds, but also by making Cloaths of their Skins. It
is as big as a large Stagg, but much stronger, with
a very high Breast, where the Hairs, which are of a
grayish colour, inclining to white, are very long
and rough. They have cloven Hoofs, the Horn of
which is as hard as Iron, so that making at every
step an Impression in the Ice, they go as securely,
as if they were shoo'd with Frost-Nails, or walk'd
upon the Ground, and that with such swiftness,
that they often Travel 150 Miles a day, their Horns
<PB N="75" REF="45"/>
are higher than those of the Elk, and larger than a
Stagg. They have on the Forehead two Brow∣anklers,
wherewith in the Winter they dig up the
white Moss from under the Snow for their Food,
and break the Ice, to get Water to quench their
Thirst. For the rest, they are very Sociable Crea∣tures,
feeding in Herds, and easily tamed, and
made serviceable for the draught of Sleds, which
they perform with an incredible swiftness.</P>
<P>By the help of these Creatures the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Merchants Travel with great Expedition, as long
as the Ice continues to bear, to the City of <HI>Genessay</HI>
or <HI>Jenessay,</HI> built by the <HI>Muscovites</HI> upon a River of
the same Name, for the conveniency of Travellers.
From thence they take Boat to go up the two Ri∣vers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lake of <HI>Biakala.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>Tongusi</HI> and <HI>Augara,</HI> to the Lake of <HI>Baikala,</HI>
where both these Rivers have their rise.</P>
<P>The Waters of this Lake are extraordinary clear,
but what makes the Passage over it very difficult
and tedious, is, that it being surrounded on all sides
with very high Rocks, and the Winds being thereby
check'd, they blow so variously, and from several
Points at a time, that they put the Masters of the
Vessels to a great deal of danger and trouble; so,
that tho' its breadth be not 30 Miles over, yet are
they obliged to spend sometimes a whole Week in
passing it.</P>
<P>After they have got over this Lake, they imme∣diately
enter towards the South, the Country of
the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleds with Sails.</NOTE> where being furnished with
Mules and Dromedaries, they continue their Jour∣ney
towards the Confines of <HI>China,</HI> which is com∣monly
done in fifteen or sixteen days.</P>
<P>But, before we part with our Travelling Mer∣chants,
I cannot forbear to mention here a certain
way they use in those Parts of easing these Reens
or Sled-Stags in their Travels, it being the more
surprising, the less any thing of that Nature is pra∣ctised
among the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> tho' I remember to
have some Years since, seen something, not unlike to
it in <HI>Holland, viz.</HI> a certain Machine, driven forward
<PB N="76" REF="46"/>
by the help of Sails upon a Level. This is per∣formed
by the help of Sails, which when the Wind
favours, they put up in their Sleds, so that by this
means they are driven along, sometimes over the
Land covered with Snow, sometimes over the Ri∣vers
frozen with Ice; the Dog and Deer supplying
the defect of the Wind in a Country all Level,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI> Tra∣vel by Land into <HI>China</HI></NOTE> (such
as is that vast Tract of Ground betwixt <HI>Siberia</HI> and
Mount <HI>Caucasus)</HI> as the Oars in a Vessel, when be∣calmed,
or labouring against the Wind.</P>
<P>It will perhaps seem strange to those, who have
some knowledge of these North-Eastern Parts, that
whereas these Travelling Merchants might with more
Ease, and less Charge, take the Advantage of those
great numbers of Rivers, which are betwixt <HI>China</HI>
and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> they should choose the way by Land,
as being both more chargeable and troublesome.
But, besides, that it is sufficiently evident out of
what has been said, that the <HI>Grand Tartary</HI> betwixt
<HI>China</HI> and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> is not so Desart, as has been
imagined, there are insurmountable Obstacles in
these Rivers, which are sufficient to deter even the
best Seamen in the World, much more the <HI>Russians,</HI>
who are hitherto not the most expert in Sea-Affairs.
Not to mention here an almost infinite number of
Rivers, whose Names are not so much as known in
<HI>Europe,</HI> the most considerable, both for the abun∣dance
of Water, and extent of their Course, are
the Rivers <HI>Oby, Genessay,</HI> or <HI>Jenessay, Lena,</HI> and <HI>Ya∣mour.</HI>
The two first have this Inconveniency, that,
where they disembogue into the Sea, they are al∣most
all the Year long, so choak'd up with whole
Mountains of Ice, that they are extreamly dange∣rous,
besides which, the latter of the two is to∣wards
the Mouth of it so full of Cataracts, or Wa∣ter-falls,
at some Leagues distance from one ano∣ther,
occasioned by the Rocks, whose tops being
all over covered with most delicious Flowers, by
their odoriferous scent, perfume the circumjacent
Air, that they cannot be pass'd without unlading
the Vessel, which cannot be done without great
<PB N="77" REF="46"/>
Charge; The Mouth of the River <HI>Lena</HI> lying more
Easterly, is not so much pester'd with Ice as the
former, and its Course much more easie, yet the
vast number of Rocks and Shelves, which lie
very close to one another at the very Entrance of
it out of the Sea, renders it very dangerous, if
not quite unpassable to Ships of never so little
Burthen, except it be to very small Fisher-Boats.
'Tis true, the River <HI>Yamour,</HI> the most Easterly of
all, would be very convenient for Traffick, its
course being uniform, were it not for a prodigious
number of Sea-Bull-rushes, which at its Entrance
into the Sea, grow like a Forest, of that thickness,
that a Man can hardly grasp one of them with both
his Arms, whereby all Passage for Ships to go into
the Sea, is quite obstructed: All these Difficulties
and Obstacles considered, who can blame the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
if they prefer the most commodious and
shortest Way before the dangers of these Rivers,
which however, are not useless, but rather very
commodious to them in their Land-Travels from
<HI>Siberia,</HI> cross the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Provinces, to the Con∣fines
of <HI>China;</HI> forasmuch as they travel with more
Ease over them when they are frozen, and are
more Navigable towards their Sources, than to∣wards
the End of their Courses? During the Dif∣ferences
betwixt the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Chineses,</HI> arisen
about the Building of the Fort of <HI>Albazin</HI> by the
first, upon the River <HI>Yamour,</HI> these Merchants used
to go by Water upon the Rivers, <HI>Oby</HI> and <HI>Szelinga,</HI>
as far as the City which bears the same name with
the last of these Rivers, being built there by the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> for the Conveniency of their Travel∣ling
Mercants. From this City they travel by Land
through the Country of the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mongul,</HI> to
the place of Residence of the Chan of <HI>Becroesain,</HI>
one of their Principal Chans, where also resides the
<HI>Coutusta-Lama,</HI> or Vicar of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> High
Priest; here by the means of some Presents, they
obtain Guides and Carriages, with a good Convoy,
who conducts them to the Frontiers if <HI>China.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Samoyedes, Groenland, Livonia and
Courland.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Samoyedes</HI> or <HI>Samogedes,</HI> inhabit that Tract
of Ground, which lies North-East of <HI>Siberia,</HI>
on both sides of the River <HI>Oby,</HI> extending to the
Streight of <HI>Weigats</HI> in the <HI>Frozen Sea;</HI> their Habi∣tation
being under the frigid Zone it self. This
Country was first discovered to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> by
a <HI>Russian</HI> Merchant, whose name was <HI>Oneke,</HI> who
having for a considerable time traded with the In∣habitants
in rich Furrs, and gathered great Wealth,
at last made a Discovery of it to the Czar of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
who having sent thither a splendid Embassy,
they soon persuaded them to submit to His Czarish
Majesty, paying a certain number of Sable Skins
for their yearly Tribute. They were formerly
comprehended under the name of those the Anti∣ents,
called <HI>Shytes</HI> or <HI>Sarmates,</HI> it being certain,
that the word <HI>Samoyedes,</HI> is a Muscovian Word, sig∣nifying
as much as self-eaters, composed out of
<HI>Sam,</HI> which signifies ones self, and <HI>Geda</HI> to eat, be∣cause
they used to eat the Bodies of their dead
Friends, mixed with their Venison, in the last of
which, this Country abounds, and always was, and
is to this day, their ordinary Food. Some would
have them to be the same <HI>Abii,</HI> of which <HI>Curtius</HI>
speaks, that they sent Ambassadors to <HI>Alexander
the Great,</HI> and that they were called <HI>Obii</HI> from the
River <HI>Oby.</HI> Tho' they have no Cities, yet do they
not live a Vagabond-life, like most of the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
but have their settled Habitations, which are
certain Cabans or Huts, some Foot deep under the
Ground, of a circular Figure, built Vault-wise
<PB N="79" REF="47"/>
a top, having in the middle of it a Hole, under∣neath
which is the Fire-place, round about
which they lie during the Winter; it serves both
for a Chimney, and sometimes for a Door, thro'
which they let in the Air, when the others are
stopt up by the Snow, which falls here often six or
seven Foot high. During this Season, which lasts
six Months, and keeps them in continual Darkness;
their Correspondence is maintain'd betwixt them
by the Trenches or Walks under Ground from one
Hut to another, by which means they visit one an∣other,
the absence of the Sun being supplied by
the melancholy light of Lamps, fed with Oil,
drawn of a certain Fish, of which as well as of
all other Necessaries, they make provision in the
Summer; which Season begins here, as soon as the
Sun comes to the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> Line, and enters into
the <HI>Septentrional</HI> Signs of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> and rejoyces
them with a Day as long, but not so tedious, as the
Night had been before. It is then they leave their
doleful Huts, and apply themselves to their usual
Employments, which is chiefly Hunting. I am apt
to believe that it is upon the Account of these <HI>Sa∣moyedes,</HI>
that some have founded their fabulous
Narrations of a certain People that sleep six Months
in the year, or that die in the beginning of Win∣ter,
and rise up again in the Spring, like the Swal∣lows
or Frogs; as that, what has been related
of some of the Northern Countreys, to wit, that
there are People there without Heads, having their
Eyes in their Breasts; That they have Feet so big,
as that one of them shades the whole Body, and
being thus covered with their Feet, neither Sun nor
Rain can come at them, questionless owes its Ori∣gin
to their Garments and Pattins they make use of
in the Winter. For, their upper Garments are
made like Vests, or rather Cosaques, falling down
to the mid-leg, border'd below with Furr, open
only at the bottom (by which they get into them)
and in the upper part, where they put out their
Faces; when the Cold is excessive, they cover
<PB N="80" REF="48"/>
their Heads with a certain Cap, like to the <HI>Capu∣chines,</HI>
made in the same Fashion with the Head of
a Man. So in the Winter-time, these <HI>Samoyedes,</HI>
as well as the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> and <HI>Finlanders,</HI> wear a
kind of Shooes or Pattins, made of Bark of Trees,
or some very thin Wood; Those that are worn by
the <HI>Samoyedes,</HI> are an Ell and a half long towards
the Toe, but those of the <HI>Laplanders</HI> and <HI>Finlanders,</HI>
are as long to the Heels as to the Toes; they use
them with so much Agility upon the Snow, that
down a Hill, they will out-do in swiftness some
Horses. For the rest, their Garments are made of
the Skins of the <HI>Reens,</HI> the Nerves and Veins of
these Beasts serving them for Thread to sow their
Cloaths; At the end of the Sleeves of their Cosaques
they have their Muffs sowed on, which they either
let hang loose, or make use of to cover their Hands,
as occasion requires. Under these Cosaques they
wear Shirts made of the Skins of young <HI>Reens</HI> or
<HI>Rain-Deer,</HI> which, having very short Hair, are softer
than Linnen, and under these Shirts they wear their
Drawers. Upon their Heads they wear very large
Caps or Bonnets, which hang down round about
their Necks; they are commonly made by the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
of Cloath of several Colours, lin'd with
Furr, and sold to the <HI>Samoyedes.</HI> They wear also
Boots with the Furr on the out-side, which makes
them appear at first sght, more like Savage Beasts
than Men. They have a way of scraping the in∣side
of the Bark of Beech as fine as the Shavings of
Ivory, which serves them for Handkerchiefs, for
they take a Handful of it at a time, to wipe their
Faces, Noses or Hands. The length of the Win∣ter
Season making their Ground not fit for Tillage,
they have no Corn nor Cattle, so that they are con∣tented,
to live upon what Nature affords them:
their Food being Fish dry'd in the Wind and Sun,
instead of Bread, Honey and Venison; and the
Flesh of young Whelps or Puppies, is esteem'd a
dainty Fare among them. Their Stature is very
low and mean, having very short Legs, almost
<PB N="81" REF="48" MS="y"/>
like the <HI>Groenlanders,</HI> of whom we shall have occa∣sion
to speak anon; their faces large and flat with∣out
Beards, and their Eyes very little, like the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> but not so sparkling. The Women here
are very ugly, so that by their Faces and Cloaths,
which are exactly like to the Men's, their Sex is
not to be distinguished at first sight. Notwithstand∣ing
which, they are very jealous of them, being
extreamly nice in preserving their Wives for their
own Use. For this reason they buy them at the
Age of six or seven from their Parents, without
daring to look upon them before the Bargain is
made, the usual payment is a certain number of
Deers, the only valuable Commodity their Coun∣try
affords, thus thinking themselves assured of
their Virginity, they keep them very close, nay
more strict than in <HI>Italy,</HI> both before and after
Marriage, and there is some who affirm, that when
they go abroad a Hunting, they make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a cer∣tain
Engine to preserve their Chastity; a convin∣cing
Instance, that Ugliness is no preservative
against Jealousie.</P>
<P>Their Language and Laws are equally unknown
to Strangers, the latter being altogether established
by Custom, before they submitted themselves to the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Government. He that is the best Magi∣cian,
is considered among them as the most excel∣lent
Man; if they happen to sell any of their Deer
to Strangers, they reserve to themselves the En∣trails,
which they keep for their own eating. Their
Arms are no other than a Bow and Arrows, which
they make use of when they go abroad a Hunting,
which being their continual Exercise, they are most
excellent at Shooting; they have also a certain way
of Dancing, but the most ridiculous in the World.
They were formerly all Pagans and Idolaters; for
when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Year 1595. in their
Voyage to the North, landed some of their Men
near the Streight of <HI>Weigats,</HI> they found near the
Sea-side abundance of Idols, for which the <HI>Samo∣yedes</HI>
had so much Affection, that they would not
<PB N="82" REF="49"/>
allow the <HI>Dutch,</HI> tho' never so much entreated, to
carry away one of them. But, in this Age the
Christian Religion was planted there by the help of
a <HI>Russian</HI> Bishop of <HI>Wolodimer,</HI> who having been
sent thither with some Priests, brought most of
them over to the <HI>Greek</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>But before we take our leave of these Northern
Parts belonging to the Grand Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s
Dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>America,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> it will perhaps not be amiss to say
something concerning a certain Conjecture some of
the most Curious among the <HI>Russians</HI> have of the
nearness of <HI>America</HI> to these Northern Parts. They
say, there is beyond the <HI>Oby</HI> a very large River,
call'd <HI>Kawoina,</HI> into which another River, named
<HI>Lepa,</HI> emptying it self, they discharge themselves
into the <HI>Frozen Sea.</HI> Near the Mouth of this Ri∣ver
is a very spacious Island, well peopled, whose
chief Employment is Hunting, but especially after
a certain Animal, call'd <HI>Behemot,</HI> of which we
shall say something anon; The <HI>Muscovites</HI> say, that
this Creature being very difficult to Hunt most ge∣nerally
upon the sides of the <HI>Frozen Sea,</HI> they often∣times
are obliged to carry their Families along with
them; so, that happening many times to be sur∣prized
by a sudden Thaw, they are upon huge
pieces of Ice, that break from one another, carried
at a great distance; They perswade themselves that
it were some of these Hunters, who being carried
upon these floating pieces of Ice to the most Nor∣thern
Parts of <HI>America,</HI> which is not far from
that part of <HI>Asia,</HI> which juts out into the <HI>Tartarian
Sea,</HI> settled the first Colonies there. They alledge,
for the confirmation of this Opinion, that the In∣habitants
of the most Northern Parts of <HI>America,</HI>
bordering on that Sea, have the same Features with
those Hunting Islanders, and that some Creatures
are very frequent in the Northern <HI>America,</HI> which
are commonly to be found on the <HI>Muscovian</HI> side,
especially Beavers, all which they believe to have
been transported thither in the same manner.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="49" MS="y"/>
As to what relates to the <HI>Behemot;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ivory Teeth of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he∣mot.</HI></NOTE> it is an am∣phibious
Animal, as big as a <HI>Crocodile,</HI> and as dan∣gerous
to Hunt. But what makes these Islanders
so Industrious, even so as to venture their Lives,
in the search after this Creature, which is usually
found in the above-mentioned River <HI>Lena,</HI> and
upon the Shoar of the <HI>Tartarian Sea,</HI> is its Teeth,
which being ten Inches long, and two in Diameter
at the Root, exceed in every respect the Elephant's
Teeth, being incomparably whiter and smoother
than the Ivory which is brought from the <HI>Indies,</HI>
and in very high Esteem amongst the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per∣sians,</HI>
who use them in making their Hafts of Scy∣mitars
and Daggers, which they prefer before Sil∣ver
or Gold; being perswaded, that it has a most
Specifick Property to stanch Blood in those that
carry it about them.</P>
<P>The Consonancy there is betwixt the <HI>Groenlanders</HI>
and the <HI>Samoyedes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Groen∣land.</NOTE> and also the <HI>Tartars,</HI> we have
spoken of before, may be a sufficient inducement to
say something of their Country, before we leave
the North. <HI>Groenland</HI> is generally now a days be∣lieved
to be a Continent bordering upon <HI>Tartary</HI> on
the East, and on <HI>America</HI> Westward; They are a
People Savage, Stubborn, and Indisciplinable, with∣out
any Civility, knowledge of Vertue or Shame;
especially in the most Northern Parts, they being
somewhat more docile towards the South-West.</P>
<P>They are all Pagans or Idolaters;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Idols</NOTE> Their Idols
being for the most part made of a piece of Wood
of one Foot and a half high, covered either with
Feathers, or with some Skin or another, the hairy
side outward. They prostrate themselves at Sun∣rising,
which seems to intimate that they adore the
Sun. There were about Forty Years ago some few
of these <HI>Groenlanders</HI> brought into <HI>Denmark,</HI> in
whom there was observed some remnants of Re∣ligion,
or rather Superstition, forasmuch as one of
them refused to eat of the Flesh of some Beasts,
as being held unclean, are not eaten in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="50"/>
Their Cloaths are made of the Skins of Sea-Dogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloaths.</NOTE>
Sea-Calves, and Reens, not unlike to those of the
<HI>Samoyedes,</HI> but that they wear under their Cosaques
Wastcoats, made of the Skins of Birds, such as
Swans, Geese, Wild Ducks, or Teals, turning the
Feathers either inward or outward, according to the
difference of the Season. The difference of both
Sexes is not easily distinguished in their Garments,
but that the Breeches of the Women do not reach
quite down to the Knees, whereas they wear theirs
below them. They live all in an equal degree, not
knowing any Superiority among one another, those
being esteemed the richest, who have the most
Children, most Bows and Arrows, and kill the most
Venison or Wild Fowl, the only Reward of their
Industry and Skill.</P>
<P>They are low of Stature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sta∣ture and Manners.</NOTE> but strong and well-set,
their Faces broad, with little Eyes, but very
lively; their Hands and Feet short, almost like the
<HI>Nagajan Tartars,</HI> but that they are more swarthy,
and their Skin much softer. Their Hair is blacker
than Jet, which they roll together, and bind it up
on their Crowns. Some of them wear certain Trin∣kets
in their Ears. The Women as well as the Maids
have their Breasts flagging and falling down to their
Bellies, the Nipples being as black as a Coal. They
suckle their Children over their shoulders, and it is
very remarkable, that those Women that were some
Years ago brought into <HI>Denmark,</HI> were observed to
have no Hair in any other Part, but the Head, and
to be free from the Monthly Courses of Women.
They are, for the rest, very like the <HI>Samoyedes,</HI> ex∣cept
that they do not make the same account of
Chastity, but in that Point Act according to the
Natural State of Freedom, both Men and Women
exercising the Venereal Act without controul or
shame, even in the Presence of a great many
standers-by, the Young Wenches being only obli∣ged
to ask their Parents consent, which they rarely
deny them. This was verified by two Instances,
in the Voyage of the <HI>Danes</HI> to <HI>Groenland,</HI> we have
<PB N="85" REF="50"/>
mentioned before; one of these Women, that was
to take a merry Bout with a Seaman, having by
this means, with several others, that were to be
Witnesses to the consummation of the Bargain,
been trapan'd under Deck, they were carried into
<HI>Norway,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Holstein.</HI> Being ar∣rived
at <HI>Bergves</HI> in <HI>Norwegen,</HI> there was no small
concourse of People to take a view of these Sa∣vages,
and among the rest a Lady of Quality ap∣proaching
nearer to the <HI>Groenland</HI> Man, he, without
any further Ceremony, attempted to Board her,
making the best way he could to find out with his
Hands, what was hidden under her Petticoats.</P>
<P>Their Language is altogether unknown to Stran∣gers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE>
unless it be some few Words, which are said
to have some resemblance with <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI>
which must be accidental. They speak very fast,
and in the Throat, and pronounce, not without
difficulty, the Words that have a G in them; they
never pronounce the R (as do also the <HI>Tartars)</HI>
but always turn it into L. They are unacquainted
with Gold or Silver; their Commerce is performed
by Trucking: They put such Commodities, as they
offer to sell, together; and on the other hand, they
pick out of what is brought to them, what they
like best, so that the Buyer and Seller add and di∣minish,
till such time that both Parties are content
with the Bargain.</P>
<P>The most valuable Commodity this Country af∣fords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com∣modities.</NOTE>
is the Teeth of the Fish <HI>Towack,</HI> which be∣ing
twisted round, and sharp at the end, not unlike
a Horn, has been for a considerable time imposed
upon the World in lieu of that of the Unicorn of
the Antients, till Experience has sufficiently evi∣denced
the contrary. This, with the Fat and Oyl
of Whales, Skins of Sea-Dogs and Sea-Calves,
they truck for Knives, Scissars, Needles, Looking-Glasses,
Iron, and Steel. Besides which, <HI>Groenland</HI>
affords Talk, Marble of all colours; and, accord∣ing
to the report of some, also Silver Oar.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="51"/>
They have a particular way of catching the
Whales.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they catch the Whales.</NOTE> They make use of a very long Thong,
cut out of the Whale's Skin, unto this they fasten
to one end a Hook, made out of the Tooth of the
before-mentioned Fish <HI>Towack,</HI> and at the other
end the Skin of a Sea-Dog, or Sea-Calf, blown up;
this being thrown at, and having wounded the
Whale, by its floating upon the surface of the Wa∣ter,
discovers the Tract of the wounded Whale.
If they believe the Wound not Mortal, they dart
several more at her, till such time they perceiving
that the strength begins to fail her with the loss of
Blood, they come up to her with their Boats, kill
her, and draw her on Shoar.</P>
<P>The Fat of the Whales, but especially their Oyl,
is the greatest Dainty they have, which they prefer
before our Sugar, Spices, or Vinegar, which they
have been observed to refuse; as they also shew'd
more satisfaction in their ordinary Food of Sea-Dogs,
Calves, Reens, Foxes, House-Dogs, and
Fish, but especially Stock-fish, than in any of our
Dishes.</P>
<P>The swarthy colour of these Inhabitants of the
coldest Climate in the World, might very well fur∣nish
us with an Opportunity to make a Digression
here, in contradiction of what is affirm'd by <HI>Pliny,</HI>
to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 2. c. 78.</NOTE> That the heat of the Sun burns the Skin,
as on the contrary, the Cold whitens it, if Natural
Philosophy were not at present beyond our scope;
wherefore we will pursue the Tract of our History,
and give a short Description of <HI>Livonia.</HI></P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Livonia</HI> or <HI>Liefland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Livonia.</NOTE> borders on
the East upon <HI>Muscovy,</HI> on the North it is divided
from <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Finland</HI> by a Gulph of the <HI>Baltick
Sea,</HI> called by the <HI>Latins, Sinus Livonicus;</HI> On the
West it hath the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> and on the South <HI>Sa∣mogitia,
Lithuania,</HI> and <HI>Prussia.</HI> It is of a very large
extent, being near 600 <HI>English</HI> Miles long, and
200 broad. It is divided into three Provinces, to
wit, into <HI>Esthonie, Lettie,</HI> and <HI>Courland.</HI> The first
of these Provinces is subdivided into five Circuits,
<PB N="87" REF="51"/>
called <HI>Hanie, Wirland, Allentaken, Jerwe,</HI> and <HI>Wiecks;</HI>
its Metropolis is <HI>Revel,</HI> as <HI>Riga</HI> of the Province of
<HI>Lettie,</HI> and <HI>Goldingen</HI> is the Capital of <HI>Courland.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Revel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Revel.</HI></NOTE> the Capital of the Province
of <HI>Esthonie,</HI> is situate upon the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> at 50
degr. 25 min. Latitude, and 48 degr. 30 min.
Longitude. It hath for its Founder, <HI>Waldemar</HI> or
<HI>Wolmar</HI> II. King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who laid the first
Foundation of it in the Year 1230. But King
<HI>Wolmar</HI> III. sold it in the Year 1347. with some
other Cities in that Country, to <HI>Goswin d' Eck,</HI> the
then Master of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order of Knights.
The <HI>Muscovites</HI> have for above these Hundred Years
past been very ambitious to unite, not only this
City, but also the whole <HI>Livonia,</HI> with the <HI>Russian</HI>
Empire, which has occasioned several Wars, not
only betwixt them and the Masters of the <HI>Livonian</HI>
Knights, but also with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> after this City
had put it self under the Protection of <HI>Eric,</HI> King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> near a Hundred and Fifty Years ago.
This City is very Famous for two memorable Sieges
it held out against the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> the first, in the
Year 1570. the second, in the Year 1577. both
which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were forced to raise with
great Loss. The City is fortified according to the
Modern way, but its chief strength lies in its Castle,
which being most advantageously situated upon a
Rock, steepy on all sides, renders it almost un∣accessible,
except towards the City, where it is de∣fended
by very good Works. It has a most excel∣lent
Haven, fitted rather by Nature than Art, for
the convenience of Trade, especially with <HI>Mus∣covy.</HI>
It is one of the most Antient Towns belong∣ing
to the <HI>Hanseatick</HI> League, and had for some
Years, in Conjunction with the City of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> the
Direction of the College belonging to the <HI>Hansea∣tick
Towns</HI> in the City of <HI>Novogorod Veliki.</HI> It was
very flourishing in its Commerce, from the Year
1477. till the Year 1550. when having broken
with the other <HI>Hanseatick Towns,</HI> the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
soon after took the City of <HI>Narva,</HI> and established
<PB N="88" REF="52"/>
there the Trading they had before in this City;
Notwithstanding which, it enjoys to this day the
Priviledge of being a Mart, which has been con∣firmed
to them by several Treaties betwixt the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> to wit, in the Year 1595.
at <HI>Teusma,</HI> in the Year 1607. at <HI>Wibourg,</HI> and in
the Year 1617. at <HI>Stolvova;</HI> tho', at the same time,
their Wings have been clip'd of late Years, as to
several Priviledges granted to them formerly by
the Masters of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order, and were since
look'd upon as dangerous to the Prerogatives of
their Sovereign. The Ecclesiastical Government is
here, like in most other Commonwealths that
profess the Protestant Religion, according to the
Tenure of the <HI>Ausburg</HI> Confession, administred by
a Consistory and a Superintendent; And their Civil
Constitution comes very near to a <HI>Democratical</HI>
State, the Magistrates having no Power to Tran∣sact
any thing of moment, without the Advice of
the Principal Men of several Professions, and in
Matters of Extraordinary Consequence, not with∣out
Summoning every Freeman of the City. With∣in
half a League of it, towards the Sea-side, are
to be seen the Ruins of a stately Monastery, about
200 Years ago dedicated to St. <HI>Bridget,</HI> by a very
wealthy Merchant of this City. The only thing
Remarkable here, is, a Book composed of the
Foundation of this Monastery, intimating, That
the Religious Men and Women (for it consisted of
both) of this Monastery had been so ingenious,
even in those days, as to have found out a way to
make themselves to be understood by one another
by certain Signs, without the help of Words.</P>
<P>The next City of Note in the Province of <HI>Est∣honie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Narva.</NOTE>
is <HI>Narva,</HI> situate in the Circuit of <HI>Allentaken,</HI>
at 60 degrees Elevation. It hath its Name from
the River <HI>Narva</HI> or <HI>Nerva,</HI> which having its rise in
the Lake <HI>Pripis,</HI> falls with a very swift Current in∣to
the Gulph of <HI>Finland,</HI> about Ten Miles below
this City. Near three Miles above it, there is a
most dangerous Cataract or Water-fall, which
<PB N="89" REF="52"/>
obliges the Ships that come down the River from
<HI>Plescou</HI> and other Places to <HI>Narva,</HI> to unlade their
Merchandizes near that Place. This Town, which
is not very large, but exceeding strong, by reason
of the adjacent Castle, is said to be built, as well
as the City of <HI>Revel,</HI> by <HI>Wolmar</HI> II. King of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
and was in the Year 1558. besieged and ta∣ken
by <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
but recovered by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the Year 1581. un∣der
the Conduct of <HI>Pontus de la Garde,</HI> the <HI>Swedish</HI>
General, under whose Jurisdiction it remains to this
day. It hath for many Years past enjoyed the same
Priviledges with the other <HI>Hanseatick Towns,</HI> and
was in the last Age a Place of very good Traffick,
till the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Trade was from thence, by the
<HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> transferred to <HI>Archangel,</HI> and
the Wars betwixt the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Swedes</HI> de∣stroyed
its Commerce. During the War betwixt
the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI>'s Time,
the Commerce to <HI>Archangel</HI> being interrupted, there
began to be a Prospect of reviving the Trade into
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> abundance of Ships making use of this
Harbour for that purpose at that time, so, that the
Haven was repaired, and several new Additions
were made to the Town, for the Conveniency of
Strangers. It has two Castles belonging to it, one
on this side of the River, and the other on the op∣posite
Shoar, in a Peninsula, made by the River
<HI>Nerva.</HI> It is called <HI>Ivanovogorod,</HI> and was built
there by the <HI>Muscovites</HI> upon a Rock, so inaccessible,
that it was judged Impregnable, and was not taken
by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> till in the Year 1617. when <HI>Gustavus
Adolphus</HI> made himself Master of it. At the foot
of this Castle is another small Town, or rather
Suburb, called <HI>Narva Muscovite,</HI> being inhabited
by <HI>Muscovites,</HI> but subject to the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Governour of
the Castle. Betwixt <HI>Revel</HI> and <HI>Narva,</HI> there are
in the Woods, Bears and Wolves of an extraordi∣nary
bigness, which, during the Winter-Season, do
abundance of Mischief to the Peasants. There is
<PB N="90" REF="53"/>
in <HI>Narva</HI> to be seen the Skin of a Wolf of a prodi∣gious
Size, which is said to have kill'd six Peasants
out of twelve he met upon the Road before he was
killed himself. They fasten commonly a great Stick
to their Sleds, which Noise they believe frightens
the Wolves and makes them run away.</P>
<P>The Capital City of the second Province in <HI>Li∣vonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Riga.</NOTE>
which is called <HI>Lettie,</HI> is the City of <HI>Riga.</HI>
Its origin is somewhat doubtful, both as to the
time, and the true name of its first Founder; some
having ascribed it to <HI>Albert,</HI> the third Bishop of
<HI>Livonia,</HI> in the Year 1196. Others to one <HI>Bertold,</HI>
of the Order of the <HI>White Fryars,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Lock∣en</HI>
in the Country of <HI>Shovenburgh,</HI> in the Diocess
of <HI>Mindea,</HI> who is said to have built it in the year
1189, and to have made it a Bishop's Seat. But
it is beyond question, that in the Year 1215, it was
raised to the Dignity of an Arch-Bishoprick, and
made the Seat of the Metropolitan of all <HI>Livonia,
Prussia</HI> and <HI>Courland.</HI> This occasioned afterwards
great Jar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs betwixt the <HI>Livonian</HI> Knights and
that Arch-Bishop, as also betwixt him and the
Masters of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order in <HI>Prussia,</HI> concern∣ing
the Sovereignty and Administration of Justice
in this place, which was at several times divided
betwixt them, till the Reformation put a stop to
their further Differences, by taking from them all
the Authority they formerly had in this City. It
surrendred it self by a voluntary Rendition to the
Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> in the Year 1561, during the
War the <HI>Muscovites</HI> made in <HI>Livonia</HI> about that
Time. Since which it was twice, but in vain, be∣sieged
by <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Sudermannia</HI> (Uncle to
<HI>Sigismond,</HI> King of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden)</HI> after he
had got into Possession of the Kingdom of <HI>Sweden.</HI>
But <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> took it at last in the Year
1621, by Composition, after a Siege of six Weeks,
and the <HI>Swedes</HI> remain ever since in Possession of it;
for, tho by virtue of the Truce concluded betwixt
the two Crowns of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the Year
1635, the same was not granted to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> any
<PB N="91" REF="53"/>
longer than till the Peace, they were, according to
the Tenour of the Treaty of Peace, concluded be∣twixt
these two Crowns, in the Monastery of <HI>O∣liva</HI>
near <HI>Dantzick,</HI> in the Year 1666, (wherein
<HI>John Casimir,</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> also resign'd his
Pretension to the Crown of <HI>Sweden)</HI> put into the
entire Possession of this City, and the whole <HI>Livo∣nia.</HI>
It is situate upon the River <HI>Dune,</HI> which about
ten or twelve Miles from hence discharges it self
into the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> and is near this City, above a
Mile broad, in a very spacious and pleasant Valley.
It is well fortified on the Land-side, to wit, with
six regular Bastions, and as many half Moons, the
Counterscarp being Pallisado'd. It is very popu∣lous,
because of the extraordinary Concourse of
People, that flock hither both in Winter and Sum∣mer
on the account of Commerce, which, while
the <HI>Baltick Sea</HI> is Navigable, is carried on with the
<HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Hanseatick Towns,</HI> and when
the Frost and Snow has fitted the Roads and River
for Sleds, with the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> All sorts of Pro∣visions
are extreamly Cheap here, but especially
Venison, by reason that the Peasants have a Privi∣ledge
hereabouts to Hunt at pleasure. The <HI>Luthe∣ran</HI>
is the established Religion here, with exclusion
of all others, whether <HI>Protestants, Catholicks</HI> or
<HI>Muscovites.</HI> The <HI>High-Dutch</HI> and <HI>Stavonian</HI> Lan∣guages,
are equally understood by most of the In∣habitants,
but the <HI>High-Dutch</HI> being look'd upon
as the Principal, not only all People of any Fashi∣on,
both in Speaking and Writing, but also the
Magistrate in his publick Acts, and the Ministers in
their Sermons make use of it, except it be in two
particular Churches, where Sermons are made in
the <HI>Slavonian</HI> and <HI>Courland</HI> Languages, for such of
the meaner Sort, as perhaps do not so exactly un∣derstand
the <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>The next City in rank is called <HI>Derpt</HI> or <HI>Torpat.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Derpt.</NOTE>
It is seated in the midst of all <HI>Livonia,</HI> upon the
River <HI>Eimbec,</HI> between the two Lakes of <HI>Worzero</HI>
and <HI>Peipis.</HI> The remnants of its antient Buildings,
<PB N="92" REF="54" MS="y"/>
shew it to have been none of the least considera∣ble
in those Parts (before the frequent Revoluti∣ons
which happen'd in this Country, during the
War betwixt the <HI>Muscovites, Poles</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> have
rendered its condition much declining from what
it was in former Ages. It is called by the <HI>Musco∣vites,
Jupogorod,</HI> who were possess'd of it till the Year
1230, when it was taken by the Master of the
<HI>Teutonick Order,</HI> who made it also the Seat of a
Bishop. In the year 1558, <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> Grand
Duke of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> having unexpectedly advanced
with an Army near to the City, struck such a Con∣sternation
into its Inhabitants, that without strik∣ing
one Blow, they surrendred to the Grand Duke.
But the Year 1571, prov'd most fatal to this City;
For one <HI>Reinold Rose,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Livonia,</HI>
having laid a Design, to put the City into the
hands of <HI>Magnus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Helstein,</HI> and being
discovered before it could be put in Execution, the
Citizens paid dearly for it, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> exerci∣sing
all manner of Cruelties upon them, without
distinction of Age or Sex. Pursuant to the Trea∣tise
of Peace, made in the year 1582, between
the Grand Duke, <HI>John Basilovits</HI> and <HI>Stephen Bat∣tory,</HI>
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> it was surrendred to the lat∣ter,
with the rest of <HI>Livonia,</HI> that remain'd in
Possession of it till the year 1625; when <HI>James
de la'Garde,</HI> General of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army, took it
from them, who keep it ever since by Virtue of the
Truce made betwixt these two Crowns, in the year
1635, which was since confirm'd by the Peace con∣cluded
in the Year 1666, at the Monastery of <HI>O∣liva.
Gustavus Adolphus</HI> founded an University
here in the Year, 1632; but it is not much fre∣quented,
unless it be by a few <HI>Finlanders,</HI> the <HI>Li∣vonian</HI>
Nobility sending their Sons for the most
part abroad to the Universities in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>To this Province also belongs the City of <HI>Parnau,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parnau.</NOTE>
having received its name from the River <HI>Parnau</HI>
or <HI>Pornou,</HI> upon which it is seated. It is divided
into the new and old Town, and was formerly a
<PB N="93" REF="54"/>
Member of the <HI>Hanseatick Leagues,</HI> but its Trade
is much decay'd of late Years, the only thing they
now deal in being Wheat; it is not very big, but
has a pretty good Castle built of Wood, after the
<HI>Muscovian</HI> Fashion. The River <HI>Pornou</HI> rises out of
a great Forest, near the Castle of <HI>Weissenstein,</HI> si∣tuated
upon the little River <HI>Beca,</HI> and being in its
passage augmented by the two Rivers, <HI>Fela</HI> and
<HI>Perukeja,</HI> exonerates its self into the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI>
not far below this City. It was for a considera∣ble
time in the possession of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who had
taken it from the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> till in the year, 1562,
the <HI>Swedes</HI> made themselves Masters of it, but was
however, three years after, recoverd by the <HI>Poles</HI>
by Stratagem, and ten Years after that, taken by
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who remain'd in possession of it,
till by virtue of the beforementioned Treaty be∣twixt
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Poles;</HI> this, with the rest
of <HI>Livonia</HI> was surrendered to the latter The
<HI>Swedes</HI> retook it from the <HI>Poles,</HI> in the Year 1617,
and have kept it ever since by the ensuing Treatises
betwixt these two Crowns.</P>
<P>The third Province of <HI>Livonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Courland.</NOTE> is the Dutchy
of <HI>Courland,</HI> being divided from the former by the
River <HI>Dune.</HI> This Province was miserably ruin'd
during the Wars betwixt the <HI>Muscovites, Poles</HI> and
<HI>Swedes;</HI> and when the Master of the <HI>Teutonick
Order,</HI> and the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Riga</HI> were forced
to submit themselves to the Protection of <HI>Poland,</HI>
with all that was remaining under their Jurisdiction,
<HI>Sigismund Augustus,</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> made <HI>Cour∣land</HI>
a Dukedom, which he bestow'd upon <HI>Godard
Kettler</HI> of <HI>Nesselroth,</HI> last Master of the <HI>Teutonick
Order</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> to be held as a Fief from the
Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> But <HI>William,</HI> the youngest
Son of this <HI>Godard,</HI> who enjoy'd the Dukedom
after his Elder Brother <HI>Frederick</HI> died without Issue,
was dispossess'd of it by <HI>Sigismund</HI> III. King of <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
being forced to live in Exile till the year
1619. when by the Mediation of several Foreign
Princes, he was re-establish'd in his Dukedom;
<PB N="94" REF="55"/>
whose Posterity enjoy it to this day. Its Capital
City is <HI>Goldingen,</HI> but the Residence of the Duke
is at <HI>Mittaw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mittaw.</NOTE> situate in that part of <HI>Courland</HI> which
is called <HI>Semgalles,</HI> above thirty Miles from the
City of <HI>Riga.</HI> During the first War betwixt the
<HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Swodes,</HI> the latter took the City of <HI>Mit∣taw,</HI>
which they fortified and kept in their Possession
till the year 1629, when, by Virtue of the Truce
then agreed on betwixt these two Crowns, they
were obliged to restore it to the Duke of <HI>Courland.</HI>
At the Entrance of the Gulph called by the Inha∣bitants,
<HI>Couri-Chaf,</HI> or <HI>Lake of Courland,</HI> is a plea∣sant
little Town,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memel.</NOTE> called <HI>Memel</HI> by the <HI>Germans,</HI> and
<HI>Cleupeda</HI> by the <HI>Courlanders.</HI> It is encompassed by
the River <HI>Tange,</HI> which not far from thence falls
into the Gulph. Its Castle is extreamly pleasantly
situated, and well fortified, and its Harbour very
commodious. It was built in the Year 1250, and
belonged to the Fryars of the Order of <HI>Livonia,</HI>
who, in the year 1328, sold it to the Master of
the Order of <HI>Prussia.</HI> By Virtue of the Truce
concluded betwixt the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Swedes</HI> in the
year 1635, this City and that Dutchy were abso∣lutely
surrendred under the Jurisdiction of the
Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who remains ever since
in full Possession of it.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Livonia</HI> it self was not known
in these Parts till in the Year 1158. when a certain
Ship of <HI>Bremen</HI> being forced by a Tempest into
the Gulph of <HI>Riga,</HI> the Merchants of that City
began to establish a Commerce, and soon after, the
Christian Religion in this Country, its Inhabitants
having been all Pagans before that time, of whose
Superstitions and Sacrifices we shall have occasion
to speak anon. The first that preached the Gospel
among them, was <HI>Menard,</HI> a Monk of <HI>Segeberg,</HI>
afterwards, in the Year 1170. made the first Bishop
of <HI>Livonia,</HI> by <HI>Alexander</HI> III. Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI> His
Successor <HI>Bertold,</HI> a Monk of the Order of <HI>White
Fryars,</HI> not following the foot-steps of his Prede∣cessor,
was for employing the Sword in converting
<PB N="95" REF="55"/>
these Idolatrous People, who having taken up Arms,
kill'd him with above 10000 Christians; so that
the Christian Interest was in the utmost danger of
having been quite lost in that Country, had not the
Prudence of <HI>Albert,</HI> a Canon of <HI>Bremen,</HI> and Suc∣cessor
to <HI>Bertold</HI> in the Bishoprick of <HI>Livonia,</HI> in
part restored what the former had lost.</P>
<P>For he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Livonian <HI>Knights.</HI></NOTE> the better to establish the Christian In∣terest
in these Parts, by the Authority received
from Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> III. laid the first Foundation of
the Order of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Knights, or <HI>Fryars of
the short Sword,</HI> so called, because they wore on
their white Cloaks a red short Sword, with a Star
of the same colour, which they have chang'd since
into <HI>two short Swords,</HI> Salter-wise. They were ob∣liged
almost to the same Rules with the <HI>Knights-Templars;</HI>
were to fight against the Infidels and
<HI>Barbarians,</HI> and to have the third part of all that
they gain'd from their Enemies. But in regard this
New Religious Order at first was scarce sufficient
to subsist upon its own Bottom, it was joyn'd to
the Order of St. <HI>Mary of Jerusalem,</HI> in the Year
1238. in the Person of <HI>Herman Balek,</HI> Grand Ma∣ster
of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order in <HI>Prussia;</HI> since which
time, the Masters of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order had a de∣pendance
from the Grand Masters of that Order,
till being hardly press'd upon by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
they were forced to submit to the Protection of
the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> It is from hence, that the
Emperours of <HI>Germany</HI> first claim'd the Title over
these Lords or Masters of the Order of <HI>Livonia,</HI>
and in the Year 1513. they became entirely Sub∣jects
of the Empire, when the Archbishop of <HI>Riga,</HI>
with his Suffragans, and the Master of the Knightly
Order, who had in part freed himself of the Sub∣jection
of the Grand Master of <HI>Prussia,</HI> were re∣ceived
among the Princes of the Empire. But the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> by reason of its convenient Situation,
had for a considerable time look'd upon it with a
wishful Eye, and in the Year 1501. entred it with
a very Powerful Army, but were vanquish'd in a
<PB N="96" REF="56"/>
pitch'd Battel, fought betwixt them and <HI>Walter de
Plattenbergh,</HI> Master of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order, where
40000 <HI>Muscovites</HI> were kill'd upon the spot, which
obliged them to make a Truce with the <HI>Livonians</HI>
for Fifty Years. This being expired, the Grand
Duke of <HI>Muscovy, John Basilovits,</HI> being flush'd
with his late Conquests of the Kingdoms of <HI>Casan</HI>
and <HI>Astrachan,</HI> and taking Advantage of the Dif∣ferences
that were then betwixt the Master of the
Knightly Order, and the Archbishop of <HI>Riga,</HI>
entred <HI>Livonia</HI> with a numerous Army, and having
ruined all with Fire and Sword in the Bishoprick of
<HI>Derpt</HI> or <HI>Torpat</HI> and <HI>Wirland,</HI> retreated into <HI>Mus∣covy.</HI>
This having put the whole Country into a
great Consternation, they were for seeking Aid in
all Parts, and having made their first Application
to the Empire, but with little Success, the City of
<HI>Revel,</HI> which was the most exposed of all, offered
to put it self under the Protection of the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> which having been refused, they had
recourse to <HI>Eric,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who likewise
refused them the desired Succours of Men and Mo∣ney,
unless they would put themselves under his
Protection (in which case he would maintain them
in their Priviledges) the City and adjacent Nobi∣lity
separated from the Master of the Order, and
submitted to the Protection of the Crown of
<HI>Sweden</HI> in the Year 1560. In the mean while,
the Archbishop of <HI>Riga,</HI> and the Coadjutor
of the Order of <HI>Livonia</HI> had made a League
Defensive with <HI>Sigismund Augustus,</HI> King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> unto whom they had promised 300000 <HI>l.
Sterling</HI> towards the defraying the Charges of the
War, and for his Security, had engaged seve∣ral
Bailywicks; But the King of <HI>Poland</HI> being
sensible of the extream danger they were in, and
how the City of <HI>Revel,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Est∣honie</HI>
or <HI>Esthland,</HI> had been forced to submit them∣selves
to the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> refused to execute
the Treaties, unless they would follow the Exam∣ple
of the rest of <HI>Livonia,</HI> and submit themselves
<PB N="97" REF="56"/>
upon the same terms to the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> as
they had done to <HI>Sweden.</HI> Being therefore reduced
to an absolute necessity of chusing the least Evil,
the Archbishop and Master of the Order were
forced to Surrender all the Acts and Charters they
had obtained from the Emperour and Pope, into
the Hands of Prince <HI>Radzivil,</HI> who, in the King
of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Name, received also from them the
Oath of Fidelity. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> gave the
Title of Duke, with the Country of <HI>Gourland,</HI> to
the Master of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order, as we have said
before, in the Description of <HI>Courland,</HI> in the Year
1562. And Twenty Years after, to wit, in the Year
1582. by vertue of a Peace concluded with the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> got into Possession of the whole
<HI>Livonia,</HI> except that part of <HI>Esthonie</HI> which had sur∣rendred
to the <HI>Swedes;</HI> who by degrees got all the
rest from the <HI>Poles,</HI> which was entirely resign'd to
them in the Year 1666. by the Treaty of Peace
made betwixt these two Crowns, in the Monastery
of <HI>Oliva,</HI> near <HI>Dantzick.</HI></P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Livonia</HI> is very fertile, but espe∣cially
in Wheat, abounding in all sorts of Cattle,
Fowl, and Venison; an Ox being commonly to be
bought here for Twenty Shillings, a Hog for a
Crown, and a good Hare for a Groat; but has
within these two Years last past been so oppress'd
with Famine, that a great many Thousands of the
Peasants have died for Hunger.</P>
<P>Its Inhabitants must be considered under different
Qualifications;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants of <HI>Livonia▪</HI></NOTE> The first, are the <HI>Germans</HI> and their
Posterity, out of which most of the Nobility, and
the Inhabitants of the Cities are composed; The
second, are the Peasants, the remainders of the
Antient Inhabitants, who living in the Champain
Country of <HI>Lettie</HI> and <HI>Esthonie,</HI> have nothing they
can call their own, but are absolute Slaves either to
the Nobility or Chief Citizens. They are called
by the <HI>Germans, Ʋnteutsche,</HI> that is to say, <HI>no Ger∣mans,</HI>
perhaps, because they cannot be brought to
conform themselves to the manner of Living and
<PB N="98" REF="57"/>
Language of the <HI>Germans.</HI> They are the greatest
Slaves in the World, but it is alledged against them,
that, if they were not kept under such a severe
Subjection, they would be always endeavouring to
recover their Liberty at any rate, of which they
have given some Proofs, when ever any Occasion
presented.</P>
<P>The Origin of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Nobility is founded
upon the Services they have in former Ages done
against the Infidels and <HI>Muscovites;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their No∣bility.</NOTE> they are free
from all Taxes and Charges. <HI>Volmar</HI> II. King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> was the first that gave them Mannors to
hold in Fealty, which were confirmed by <HI>Eric</HI> VII.
by Letters Patents, and augmented by the Masters
of the <HI>Short Sword,</HI> and the Grand Masters of <HI>Prussia.</HI>
Some of these Mannors, especially in the Districts
of <HI>Harrie</HI> and <HI>Wirland,</HI> are Inheritable by the Daugh∣ters
and their Issue, to the fifth degree. But they
are above all beholding to that Famous <HI>Walter de
Plattenbergh,</HI> who being in the Year 1513. acknow∣ledged
a Prince of the Empire, exempted the No∣bility
from all Subjection, excepting such Services
as they were obliged to do in Person, upon the ac∣count
of their Mannors. When Necessity obliged
them to have recourse to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> they did not
submit to that Crown, but with a <HI>Proviso,</HI> of re∣taining
their Antient Priviledges, which, for the
most part, they keep to this day. There is once a
Year a Review made of this Nobility, which does
not only, upon occasion, furnish the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
with a considerable Body of Horse, but also is
look'd upon by the <HI>Sweden</HI> as their chief Nursery of
Officers, even to the Generals of Armies. The
Administration of the Government, both as to Po∣licy
and Justice, is committed to Twelve of the
Body of the Nobility, who are the Council of the
Country, of which, the Governour of the Province
from the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> is President. Their
Judicial Processes are very short, and decided once
a Year, to wit, in <HI>January,</HI> by this Council, who,
after a Declaration and an Answer, proceed im∣mediately
<PB N="99" REF="57"/>
to Judgment. To perform this with the
more conveniency, each Province has its own Cap∣tain,
as they call him, whose Business is, to repre∣sent
to the Governour and Council the Grievances
of the People, and this Employment is never con∣tinued
above three Years in the same Person. There
are also certain Triennial Judges appointed for the
determining of Differences in the flat Country;
concerning the Limits betwixt Private Men, which
have been rendred dubious by the Wars; and some
other Judges or Overseers of the High-ways, Bridges,
and Causways; But from all these there lies an
Appeal to the Council of the Country.</P>
<P>As to their Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Re∣ligion.</NOTE> they are <HI>Lutherans</HI> here,
which must be chiefly understood from the Nobility
and Inhabitants of Cities, but, as for the Peasants;
they can scarce be called half Christians, much less,
to be said of any particular Religion, being, even
to this day, so deeply entangled in their Heathenish
Superstitions, that they scarce ever go to Church,
or at least, never Communicate, unless it be by
force, they being, notwithstanding that wretched
and slavish Condition they live in, quite regardless
of any thing else but this Life. 'Tis upon this Ac∣count,
that, when they take an Oath, they con∣clude
with these words: <HI>If I do not swear true, I
am content, that the Curse of God may light upon my
Body and Soul, upon my Children, upon all what ap∣pertains
to me, to the Ninth Generation.</HI> Some of
them, especially the Peasants about <HI>Riga,</HI> if they
are to take an Oath at Law, put a Turff upon their
Heads, with a white Stick in their Hands, thereby
signifying, that they consent, That, <HI>they, their Chil∣dren,
and Cattle, may become as dry as the Turff and
Stick,</HI> if they swear falsely. They frequently put
a Needle and Thread into the Grave with the de∣ceased,
because, forsooth, <HI>he may perhaps have occa∣sion
to mend his Cloaths in the other World.</HI> Sorcery
is much more frequent among them than Prayers,
the first is propagated by Tradition from the Pa∣rents
to their Children. They never kill a Beast,
<PB N="100" REF="58"/>
but some part of it is thrown away, nor never brew,
but something must be spilt, which they look upon
as a Preservative against Witchcraft; Nay, they
have a way of rebaptizing their Children themselves
(tho' privately) if in some Weeks after the first
Baptism they happen to fall sick, which; they say,
is occasioned by the Child's having received a Name
not suitable to its Constitution, and therefore are
obliged to give it another. They love to do their
private Devotions upon Hills, or near a Tree, in
which having made several Incisions, and ty'd it
up with some red Stuff, they there offer their Prayers,
which always tend to some benefit of this Life.
The Peasants about <HI>Revel</HI> and <HI>Narva</HI> go once a
Year, <HI>viz.</HI> on the day of our Lady's Visitation, on
Pilgrimage to an old ruin'd Chappel betwixt these
two Cities, where kneeling before a great Stone
that is in the midst of it, they offer Fruits and
Flesh as a Sacrifice for the Preservation of them∣selves
and their Cattle, the whole ending with
Dancing, Drinking, and sometimes Fighting. All
this is not so much to be attributed to their Igno∣rance
as Stubbornness; for there is scarce a Village
but what has a Church and Minister, and the Bishop
of the Province residing at <HI>Revel,</HI> keeps as watchful
an Eye as possibly he can over the Clergy, besides
which, the Catechism, the Gospel and Epistles, with
certain Explications added to it, have been long
ago translated into their Native Tongue, for their
general Benefit; but all this has proved insufficient
to root out of these stubborn Peasants the remnants
of their Idolatrous Superstitions.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are in a great measure as odd as
some other of their Customs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wed∣dings.</NOTE> For, if a Peasant
Marries a Country Lass out of another Village, he
gets on Horseback, with a Stick cleft at the top;
wherein is put a Brass Piece of Money, thus equip∣ped,
and accompanied by two of his Friends with
naked Swords in their Hands, and a Bag-piper ri∣ding
before him, he comes to fetch the Bride, whom
he sets behind him, and having made her embrace
<PB N="101" REF="58"/>
him with the Right-hand, away he rides to the
House where the Marriage is to be consummated;
when they come to the Door, his two Friends give
each of them a stroak with their Swords cross the
Door of the House, which being opened, he gives
the Brass Piece of Money to the first he meets with
there. Being entred, his two Friends stick their
Swords into a Beam directly over his Head, which
they pretend to be done to prevent Charms; for
which purpose also, the Bride, as she comes along
the Road, scatters little pieces of some red Stuff
or another by the way, but especially, where any
Cross-ways meet, or near any Crosses which are put
upon the Graves of little Children, which die with∣out
Baptism, whom they bury in the High-way.
They have however one Custom, which, among
People so barbarous, seems to have something ex∣traordinary
in it. For, after the Bride and Bride∣groom
are set down at the Table with the Guests,
they don't tarry long there, but within half an
hour, leaving the Guests to themselves, they get to
Bed, after having for the space of two hours try'd
one anothers Vigour, return to the Table, where,
with Drinking and Dancing they spend the remain∣der
of the Day and following Night, till, what
with Weariness, and what with Drunkenness, their
Legs begin to fail them, when they all Pig toge∣ther
in one Nest. As for their Garments, they are
suitable to their wretched Condition, to wit, of a
coarse Cloath; the Womens Petticoats being with∣out
any Plaits like a Sack. Those, who have been
able to save a little by their Drudgery beyond the
rest, wear about their Necks a Necklace of Plates
of Silver, of the bigness of a Crown Piece, and
upon the Breast one hanging down by a Chain as
big as a Trencher, but not very thick; Their Shooes
are either made out of the Barks of Trees, or raw
Leather of a Cows Hide.</P>
<P>But, because we have had occasion to speak here
of the Superstition of these <HI>Demi-Christian Peasants</HI>
in <HI>Livonia,</HI> it will not be altogether beyond our
<PB N="102" REF="59"/>
scope, to subjoin here some Memorable Observa∣tions
(not commonly known) concerning the Re∣ligion,
Sacrifices, and certain Customs of the An∣tient
Inhabitants of <HI>Livonia, Prussia, Lithuania,
Russia,</HI> and some other Neighbouring <HI>Sarmatian</HI>
Nations, when <HI>Pagans;</HI> Forasmuch as there does
not only appear a great congruity betwixt them
and some of these Idolatrous Superstitions, we
have just now related of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Peasantry,
but also, by making a due comparison, a great
many Customs retained to this day by the Northern
Nations, and among them more-especially by the
<HI>Russians,</HI> as to what relates to their Carnavals, Mar∣riages,
Funerals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be observed to owe their
first Off-spring to their <HI>Pagan</HI> Ancestors. These
Nations, before they were converted to the Chri∣stian
Religion, had many Gods, unto whom they
used to Offer their Sacrifices. <HI>Occopirnus,</HI> was cal∣led
by them the God of Heaven and Earth, <HI>An∣trimpus</HI>
was the God of the Sea, <HI>Gardvates,</HI> the
God and Patron of the Sea-faring Men, these three
being reckoned equivalent among them to <HI>Jupiter,
Neptune</HI> and <HI>Portuninus</HI> by the <HI>Romans.</HI> Besides
these, <HI>Potrympus</HI> was their God of all Rivers and
Fountains, <HI>Pilvitus</HI> the God of Riches, <HI>Perguboius</HI>
the God of the Spring. <HI>Pargnus</HI> the God of Thun∣der
and Tempests; <HI>Poctus</HI> the God of Darkness
and Infernal Spirits. <HI>Poccollus</HI> the God of the Spi∣rits
of the Air; <HI>Putscaetus</HI> the God of sacred Woods
and Groves. <HI>Ausceutus</HI> the God of Health and
Sickness; <HI>Marcoppol</HI> the God of Noblemen: be∣sides
which, they had those they called <HI>Back∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI>
or <HI>Erdmanlein</HI> by the <HI>Germans,</HI> That is to say,
living under Ground; and some other Spirits,
which used to appear to them; in the <HI>Russian</HI>
Tongue, called <HI>Colkie,</HI> by the <HI>Greeks, Coboli,</HI> and
<HI>Cobolds</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> Language.</P>
<P>On St. <HI>George</HI>'s Day, they used to offer their Sa∣crifice
to <HI>Pergubrius,</HI> the God of Flowers, Plants
and Fruits of the Earth, in the following manner▪
The Priest holding a Cup of Beer in his right hand,
<PB N="103" REF="59"/>
adores the Idol,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> and calling him by his Name, sings
thus in his praise: <HI>Thou drivest away the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
restorest to us the Pleasures of the Spring; it is owing to
thy Power, that our Fields and Gardens appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine
and green, and that the Trees and Forests are covered
with Leaves.</HI> Having finish'd this Song, the Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st
taking hold of the Cup of Beer with his Teeth,
drinks it off quite, without the help of his Hands;
when he throws it backwards over his Head. The
Cup being taken up from the Ground, and reple∣nish'd
with the same Liquor, all that are present
drink one after another, singing the abovemention∣ed
Hymn in praise of the Idol; and spending the
remainder of the Day in Feasting and Dancing.
When the Harvest-time begin to app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oach, the
Country People used to perform the same Sa∣crifice,
which in the <HI>Russian</HI> Language, they call'd
<HI>Zazinck,</HI> that is to say, the beginning of the Har∣vest.
The Sacrifice being over, they used to chuse
one of those that were present, to begin the Har∣vest,
who cutting down immediately a Handful
of Corn, carried it to his House till next day;
when first he and his Servants, and then the rest
began the Harvest; which being ended, they used
again to meet and perform the same Sacrifice as
before, which they called in the <HI>Russian</HI> Language
<HI>Ozinck,</HI> which signifies the End of the Harvest.</P>
<P>When they were to Sacrifice to their Idol, called
<HI>Putscaetus,</HI> or the God of Groves and sacred Trees,
they used to perform it under an Elder Tree, where
they brought Bread, Beer and other Eatables; of∣fering
their Prayers to the Idol, and begging his
Intercession with <HI>Marcoppol,</HI> the God of Noble∣men,
to preserve them from being oppressed by
their Lords; and desiring him to send them some
of the <HI>Barstucks,</HI> or Subterraneous Spirits; They
were verily persuaded, that if these <HI>Demons</HI> take
to a House, they bring good Luck to the Owners
of it, for which reason they did set upon a Table
in their Barns towards Night, Bread, Cheese,
Butter and Beer, if they found this eaten up against
<PB N="104" REF="60"/>
next Morning, they promised themselves all the
good Fortune in the World; but if they found
it untouch'd as they left it the Night before,
they did presage to themselves nothing but Misfor∣tunes.
In the same manner they were persuaded
concerning the <HI>Cobolds,</HI> as the <HI>Germans,</HI> or <HI>Colky</HI>'s,
as the <HI>Russians</HI> call them, that they dwell'd in the
most obstruse Corners of old Buildings, or among
great Heaps of Wood; and that they would carry
their Neighbours Corn into their Barns, for which
reason they would be sure every night to leave up∣on
the Table the best of Victuals the House afford∣ed.
They believed, that when any of these <HI>De∣mons</HI>
did intend to fix their Habitation in a certain
House, they used to make the Master of the House
sensible of their Intention, in the manner follow∣ing:
They would carry what small Wood there
was ready cut in the House together in one Heap,
and put into their Milk-Pans, fill'd with Milk the
Dung of several Sorts of Creatures. If the Ma∣ster
of the House be willing they should appear
and settle in his House, he must with his whole
Family drink of the Milk thus seasoned with
Dung.</P>
<P>They used to keep a perpetual Fire on the top of
a very high Mountain in <HI>Samogitia,</HI> betwixt <HI>Lithu∣ania</HI>
and <HI>Livonia,</HI> committed to the Care of certain
Priests, in Honour of the Idol <HI>Pargnus,</HI> whom they
believed the God of Thunder and Tempests.</P>
<P>To the other Gods we have named before, they
either jointly, or sometimes to one in particular
used to sacrifice a He-Goat, which was thus per∣form'd:
The Priest, after those that were to be
present at the Sacrifice, were Assembled, having
laid both his Hands upon the Goat, mutter'd out
certain Prayers to such God or Gods, as they in∣tended
the Sacrifice to, and, having craved his or
their Assistance, all that were present lifted up the
Goat, and held it so long in the Air, till the Priest
had finish'd a certain Hymn, which being done,
the Goat was again set upon his Legs on the ground.
<PB N="105" REF="60"/>
Then the Priest made a Harrangue to the People,
containing in Substance; That <HI>they should be very
careful in performing this Sacrifice according to the Insti∣tution
of their pious Ancestors, with all imaginable Devo∣tion,
and transmit it without blemish to Posterity.</HI> Having
ended his Sermon, he kill'd the Goat, and having
sprinkled the Standers-by with the Blood, the Flesh
is given to the Women to boil; which done, they
feast upon it all the Night, till they are all drunk,
and if any of the Flesh happen to be left, the next
Morning they bury it under Ground, for fear it
should be defil'd by the Birds or other Beasts.</P>
<P>Some of these Pagan Nations used to keep Snakes
or Serpents in a certain Corner of the House, espe∣cially
near their S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oves, which heat their Rooms;
at certain times their Priests were to come to the
House, and to Conjure these Creatures to come
forth out of their Holes, and to taste of such Dain∣ties
as were ready prepared for them upon a Table
set for that Purpose; if the Snakes are obedient to
the Priest's Command, and take a Taste of all what
is set before them, the whole Family, after the
Snakes have withdrawn themselves into their Holes,
eat the rest with a great deal of Joy and Content,
as presaging to themselves nothing but good For∣tune,
for that Year. But if these Creatures hap∣pened
to prove disobedient, not hearkning to the
Conjuring Priest, they appear very sad and melan∣choly,
as believing that some great Misfortune is
likely to befall them that Year.</P>
<P>They had also a certain Sort of Southsayers, whom
they call'd <HI>Burty</HI> in the <HI>Russian</HI> Language; these
acknowledge for their Patroon, the God <HI>Potrympus,</HI>
unto whom having made their Addresses, and mut∣ter'd
out certain Words, they used a certain way of
powring melted Wax into Water, and according to
the several Figures and Shapes that appear'd whilst
they were casting, they pretended to resolve such
Questions as were presented to them.</P>
<P>Their Nuptial and Funeral Rites were performed
in the following manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> After the young Couple
<PB N="106" REF="61"/>
had made mutual Promise of Marriage to one an∣other,
two of the nearest Relations of the Bride∣groom
used to take the Bride, as it was, by force
out of her Fathers House, which being done, they
address themselves to the Parents, or such as have
the Disposal of them, who then publickly give their
Consent to the Marriage. The Day appointed for
the Consummation of the Marriage being come,
the Bride, with Bells hanging from the Girdle
down to her Knees, is led three times back and for∣ward
into the Kitchen, and being afterwards put
into a Chair, her Feet are wash'd with Spring Wa∣ter,
wherewith they sprinkle the Nuptial Bed, their
Houshold Stuff, and all the Guests invited to the
Feast. After that, they used to give to the Bride a
taste of Honey, and putting a Veil over her Face,
conduct her to every Door that belong'd to the
House, where she was obliged to knock with her
right Foot against them; In the mean while, a Ser∣vant,
who followed her with a Sack, fill'd with all
sorts of Corn, to wit, Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats,
Pease, Beans, and the Seed of Poppies, used to
strow the Ground round about her, wherever she
went, frequently repeating to her these Words: <HI>If
thou remain'st devout and constant in thy Religion, and
be'st careful of thy House, thou shalt never want any of
these Things;</HI> Then the Veil is taken away, and the
Bride placed at the Table with the Guests, invited
to the Feast. At night they begin to Dance, and
whilst the Bride is a Dancing, they cut off her Hair,
and put upon her Head a Garland, which the Mar∣ried
Women wear till they have brought forth a
Son, being till then look'd upon as Maidens. At
last, she is conducted into the Room, where the
Nuptial Bed is prepared, and being forced, not
without some Blows, to undress her self, she is
thrown by the rest into the Bed, and let to the Mer∣cy
of the Bridegroom. But after an Hour, or there∣abouts,
they refresh themselves in Bed with a Cup
of good Liquor, and a Dish of Stones of Kids or
young Bears, which they believe to contain a great
<PB N="107" REF="61"/>
fortifying Quality, and to further Conception; for
which Reason also, it is their Custom, at their Wed∣ding
Feasts never to eat the Flesh of any Creature
that is gelt.</P>
<P>In their Funeral Rites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fu∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rals.</NOTE> they observed this Me∣thod:
They dress the Corps of their deceased Friends
in their best Cloaths, with Shooes and Stockins, and
having set it up-right in a Chair, the next Relati∣ons
making a Ring about it, drink very heartily;
When the Liquor is out, they begin to lament their
Deceased Friend. <HI>Alas!</HI> say they, <HI>Why wouldst
thou die? Didst thou want either Victuals or Drink?
Why wouldst thou die then? Alas! Hadst thou not a
Handsom Wife? Why wouldst thou die then?</HI> Thus
running through every Particular thing possessed by
the Deceased in his Life-time, they ask in the same
manner; and conclude, <HI>Why wouldst thou die?</HI> They
are very careful to furnish them with Needle and
Threed, when they are laid in their Coffins, and
with some Bread and a Bottle of Liquor. When
the Corps is carried out to the Burying-place, the
Relations on Horseback, surround the Hearse or
Waggon in which it is plac'd, and with their Swords
drawn, strike in the Air cross-ways, crying out
aloud, <HI>Away you Demons to the infernal Places of
Darkness.</HI> At last, whilst the Corps is putting into
the Ground, they throw some Money after it into
the Grave. The Widdow Mourns for forty Days,
<HI>viz.</HI> Mornings and Evenings, Sun rising and setting,
over her Husband's Grave; but the rest of the Re∣lations
celebrate the Memory of the Deceased at
certain appointed Days, to wit, on the Third, the
Sixth, the Ninth, and Fortieth day; when, after a
certain Form of Prayers, which they mutter out
before they enter the House, they invite the Soul of
the Deceased to come and take part with them.
Whilst they are at Table, there is not a Word to be
spoken, neither do they make use of Knives. They
are attended by two Women, who divide the Vi∣ctuals
among the Guests, but also without Knives.
Each of the Guest throws something of his Victu∣als,
<PB N="108" REF="62" MS="y"/>
as also some of the Liquor, under the Table,
which they believe is the Food of the Soul of the
Deceased. If any thing happens to fall under the
Table, it is not to be taken up, this being to be left
for the Food of such Souls as are destitute of
Friends, or are otherwise unable to Feast th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m after
their Death. The Feast being over, the Priest is
the first that rises from the Table, and having swept
all the Dust out the Doors with a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oom; <HI>Retire,</HI>
says he, <HI>beloved Souls, you have been sufficientl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fed
with Victuals and Drink; Retire, beloved Soul▪ from
this House.</HI> Then it is that the Guests begin first to
Speak, and to let the Cup go briskly round, the
Men drinking to the Women in Remembrance of
their dead Friend, and the Women answering the
Men with the same Freedom, till they all begin
to be Mellow, when they part with Kissing one an∣other
all round.</P>

till the Year 1474, when <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Emperour took them from the <HI>Genoeses.</HI> The Pla∣ces
in the possession of the <HI>Turks</HI> are <HI>Batuclawa,</HI> for∣merly
a considerable place, but now more like a Vil∣lage
than a City; it has not above 200 Houses, but
has a very good Port, and the <HI>Turks</HI> build there a∣bundance
of Ships and Gallies. The two Castles of
<HI>Ingermen</HI> and <HI>Mancus,</HI> to which were adjoining, when
in the Hands of the <HI>Genoeses,</HI> two goodly Cities,
of which scarce any thing remains now but the
Ruin. The only place of Note belonging to the <HI>Turks</HI>
here, is one City of <HI>Caffa,</HI> in former Ages called
<PB N="110" REF="63" MS="y"/>
<HI>Theodosia.</HI> It was, whilst the <HI>Genoeses</HI> were Masters
of it, one of the chief Trading places in the <HI>Levant,</HI>
but the <HI>Turks</HI> took it from the <HI>Genoeses,</HI> as was men∣tioned
before, after a Siege of fourteen Years, and,
as it was believed, not without Treachery, some of
the <HI>Genoeses</HI> having been corrupted with Money. It
is since that time, (as almost all other places
that groan under the <HI>Turkish</HI> Yoak) infinitely
decayed from its antient Splendor; notwithstan∣ding
which, it contains as yet about 6000 Houses,
inhabited by <HI>Italians</HI> (the Remnants of the <HI>Ge∣noese</HI>
Families) <HI>Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Turks</HI>
and <HI>Tartars:</HI> The Christians being however the
most in number, having 45 Churches here.</P>
<P>The Places belonging to the <HI>Precopian Tartars,</HI> as
well within the <HI>Chersonesus</HI> as upon the <HI>Palus Meo∣tides,</HI>
are; The City of <HI>Azoph</HI> or <HI>Assaw,</HI> situate at the
very Mouth of the River <HI>Don</HI> or <HI>Tanais,</HI> where it exo∣nerates
it self into the <HI>Palus Meotides;</HI> it is a place
of considerable Trade, inhabited for the most part
by <HI>Tartars,</HI> from whom it was about two years ago
taken by the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> The City of <HI>Crim,</HI> situate
in a Bay, made by the Sea of <HI>Zabacche,</HI> or the <HI>Palus
Meotides;</HI> it is inhabited for the most part by <HI>Tar∣tars.</HI>
It is a strong Walled Town, its Houses being
built of Stone and Brick, and was formerly the
Seat of their <HI>Chan,</HI> from whence these <HI>Tartars</HI> re∣ceived
first their Name, as they were afterwards
called <HI>Precopians</HI> from the City of <HI>Precop,</HI> (which
is situate on the Eastern side of the <HI>Isthmus:</HI> The
<HI>Tartars</HI> call it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is not very large, consisting
only of 400 or 500 Houses. It was called <HI>Precop,</HI>
from the <HI>Sclavonian</HI> Word <HI>Precap,</HI> which signifies a
Ditch or Trench; because it was built just within
the Trench of the <HI>Taurica Chersonesus,</HI> which is
made cross the <HI>Isthmus.</HI> Opposite to this, on the
Western side, is the City of <HI>Coslow,</HI> situate upon a
Cape of the <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> extending to the <HI>Exin
Sea.</HI> It has about 2000 Houses, and is a place of
good Trade, and about five or six Days Journey
from <HI>Azoph.</HI> Further Westward at the Mouth of
<PB N="111" REF="63"/>
the River <HI>Boristhenes</HI> or <HI>Nieper,</HI> near the <HI>Euxin Sea,</HI>
lies the City of <HI>Oczacow,</HI> having a strong Castle;
it formerly belonged to the Great Dukes of <HI>Lithua∣nia,</HI>
but was taken from them by the <HI>Precopian
Tartars,</HI> who inhabit here, yet so as to be Tributa∣ries
to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who always keep some Gallies here
to keep a watchful Eye over the neigbouring <HI>Co∣sacks.</HI>
It is near 200 Miles distant from <HI>Precop.
Baciasaray</HI> is the Town where the <HI>Chan</HI> keeps his or∣dinary
Residence and Court, it contains about 2000
Houses: besides which, he has another Palace, called
<HI>Almasaray,</HI> where he diverts himself sometimes;
it is only a Village containing not above 60 or 70
Houses. The <HI>Taurica Chersonesus</HI> is in some parts
full of Hills and Woods, but in others has very
fertile Plains, abounding in all sorts of Grain, Fruit,
and very excellent Wine. The <HI>Tartars</HI> that inhabit
it seldom apply themselves to Tillage or any other
manner of cultivating the Ground, but leave it to
the <HI>Jews</HI> or the <HI>Christians,</HI> which are their Slaves.
And as for the <HI>Tartars</HI> that live without the <HI>Isthmus,</HI>
they make not the least account of it; applying
themselves entirely to Pasturage and Robberies.
All their Riches consist in their Cattle, but especially
in their Horses, and in what Booty they get abroad
in their Excursions; They sell their Prisoners of
both Sexes, after the <HI>Chan</HI> has taken his Share of
them for his own Use, to the <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Jewish</HI>
Merchants at <HI>Caffa;</HI> in Exchange of which they take
from them <HI>Turkish</HI> Horses, Arms, Stuffs, and such other
Commodities as they stand in need of. From the
City of <HI>Caffa,</HI> these Slaves are transported to <HI>Constan∣tinople,
Synope, Trebisord,</HI> and other places in the <HI>Le∣vant.</HI>
Among all the Slaves taken by these <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
the <HI>Polish</HI> Women are in greatest esteem; these
are not only transported to <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI>
but sometimes to the <HI>Indies,</HI> to be entertained in
the <HI>Seraglio's</HI> of these Princes. Formerly the
<HI>Soldans</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> used to drive a considerable Trade
in these Parts, the chief Strength of their Forces
being consp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d of such as the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made
<PB N="112" REF="64"/>
Prisoners either in <HI>Russia, Podolia, Muscovy,</HI> and
<HI>Circassia.</HI> But since the Ruin of this Warlike
Empire by <HI>Selim</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperour, this Trade
into <HI>Egypt</HI> is quite lost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Crim</HI> or <HI>Precopian Tartars</HI> are for the most
part of a middle Size,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Crim <HI>or</HI> Preco∣pian Tar∣tars <HI>descri∣bed.</HI></NOTE> strong, and well set in
their Limbs; they have short Necks, large and
broad Faces, with very small Eyes, but very black
and lively, and have some other Features peculiar
to themselves, by which they may be easily di∣stinguish'd
from other Nations. They are inur'd
to all sorts of Hardship from their Infancy; their
Mothers being used to bathe them once a Dayat least
in cold Water, wherein a little Salt is dissolved, to
make them hardy, and render their Bodies proof
against the Injuries of the Air. No sooner are
they out of their Mother's Tution, but their Fa∣thers,
by degrees, bring them to shoot with the
Bow, which they do with great Dexterity; and
at the Age of twelve or fifteen, make them go
along with them in the Wars. The Common <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
especially those living abroad in Tents, use
no other Cloaths but a <HI>Cosaque,</HI> coming down to
their Heels, made of Sheep-Skin, with a picked
Cap or Bonnet of the same Stuff, under which
they wear perhaps a pair of Linnen Breeches or
Drawers. The Men and Women are scarce to be
distinguish'd in their Dress, but that the last wear
often a Linnen Coif, or piece of coarse Cloth
tyed round their Heads. The Wives of their <HI>Chans,</HI>
and other Women of Quality always wear a Veil
over their Faces when they appear in publick,
and are cloathed in Calicoes, Stuffs, and sometimes
Silk of divers Colours; as their chief Men have
their Cloaths made of Cloth, and use <HI>Turkish</HI> Sad∣dles
for their Horses, which are often of the <HI>A∣rabian</HI>
Breed, and adorned with very good Equi∣pages,
all which they have of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Mer∣chants,
or else take from their neighbouring Na∣tions,
where they make their Inroads. For the
rest they use nothing but Wooden Saddles; Their
<PB N="113" REF="64"/>
Arms are commonly a Scymiter, a Bow and Qui∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,
furnish'd with twenty or more Arrows. These
as well as their Saddles, they make themselves;
Their Bow-strings are made out of the Nerves of
Horses; the Quiver covered with the Skin of the
same Beast: They make also the best Whips in the
World, our Whip-makers in <HI>Europe</HI> having hitherto
not been able to come near them in twisting of
Whips. Besides their Arms, they always carry
about them a Knife, which serves to mend their
Bridles and Saddles, if any thing happens to be a∣miss;
a Tinder-box to strike Fire; and a Compass
to direct them in their March through the Desarts
and Wildernesses, where there is not the least Tract
of any Road.</P>
<P>Their Horses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hor∣ses.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Bachmats,</HI> are very
ill-shaped, being very long and thin, with long
Manes and Tails; but what they want in Shape
they make up in Swiftness and Hardiness, being in
both these Points together, to be preferred before
any other in the World: They commonly undergo
the Fatigue of a long days Journey without the
least Food; they are continually kept abroad, both
Winter and Summer; and when they are upon an
Expedition, these Beasts will live upon what they
can pick out from under the Snow, or upon the
Moss, Bark, or small Branches of Trees, or upon
any thing else that they light on in their Way.
Their Chief Men make use of <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI>
Horses, wear under their Cosaques Coats of Mail,
and use very good Equipages: Their <HI>Chan,</HI> espe∣cially
is most Magnificent in his Horses and Equi∣pages,
keeps a very good Table, and lives as to all
other things, in great Splendor, suitable to his Quality.</P>
<P>When they live abroad in their Tents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> they sel∣dom
eat Bread, instead of which they make use of
Millet. Their Ordinary Food is Horse-flesh, which
they boil, either alone, or with Millet, when they
rest in a Place; but when they are going upon an
Expedition they have it bak'd, and upon the
March, often only roll it together, and put it under
<PB N="114" REF="65"/>
the Saddle, from whence they take it upon occa∣sion,
and so eat it without any further Preparation
or Sauce, unless it be the Sweat of their Horses.
The worst of all is, that they do not chuse the
Youngest or the Fattest of their Horses, but such as
are either rendred unserviceable in a March, or die
of themselves. They don't drink Wine, as being
<HI>Mahometans;</HI> so that their ordinary Drink is
clear Water; and in the Winter, when the Rivers
and Springs are frozen up, they make use of Snow;
or sometimes of the Broth of bak'd Horse-flesh,
or a certain Liquor made out of Millet. Their
Chief Officers only, drink Water, Milk, or perhaps
Hydromel and <HI>Aqua vita,</HI> and have now and then
a Dish of Wild-fowl: But all of them abstain
from Swines Flesh.</P>
<P>As to their Manners, they are said to be as free
from Vices as any Nation in the World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Manners.</NOTE> For, be∣sides
their Abstinence in Eating and Drinking, they
are accounted very faithful and trusty; there being
no such thing as Robbing among themselves, no
false Witnesses, no manner of Injustice or Violence;
living with one another in a perfect Union and
Tranquility: For, as to those Excursions they
make into the Territories of the Neighbouring
Christians, they don't look upon them as a Crime,
as being committed against those they esteem Infi∣dels;
There are abundance of Instances to be gi∣ven
of the Fidelity of these <HI>Tartars,</HI> which has
been sufficiently experienced among some of their
neighbouring Nations, where they are Prisoners:
It is very frequent in <HI>Poland</HI> to let the <HI>Tartarian</HI>
Prisoners go upon their Parole of Honour, to en∣deavour
the Recovery of their Liberty by the Ex∣change
with certain <HI>Polish</HI> Prisoners among the
<HI>Tartars;</HI> which if they cannot obtain, they are
sure to return by the Day prefixed, even sometimes
to an Hour. There are Persons of Quality in <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
who will rather entrust the Key of their
most precious Moveables, with their <HI>Tartarian</HI> Slaves,
than with any other of their Servants.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="65"/>
Their Tongue and Religion is the same with the
<HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> but only that they have not so many <HI>Persian</HI>
and <HI>Arabian</HI> Words mix'd with it, and they have their
Priests, who are guided by the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and inter∣pret
it, after the Turkish way.</P>
<P>As their Religion and Language agree in most
Points with the <HI>Turks,</HI> so their Government and
Administration of Justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Go∣vernment.</NOTE> is the same used in <HI>Tur∣ky.</HI>
They have their <HI>Cadi</HI>'s, who hear the Parties
plead their own Cause by way of Mouth, and give
Judgment immediately. The <HI>Chan</HI> himself fre∣quently
determines the Differences among his Sub∣jects,
which he does as often as he appears
in Publick, without the least regard or respect of
Persons, whether rich or poor. Drunkenness, A∣dultery,
Murther and Thefts, are the most Capital
Crimes here, and are sure to meet with severe Pu∣nishments;
which however, is very rare to be seen;
for, tho' they are used to Robbing and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undering
in time of War, they nevertheless keep themselves
within their due bounds when they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at home,
no body being allowed to carry about him any
Arms, not so much as in the <HI>Chan</HI>'s own Court.
They are under the Subjection of one Prince, whom
they call <HI>Chan,</HI> which is as much as to say, King;
He commands over them without Controul, as
most all the other <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes, and is in
great Veneration with his Subjects. The <HI>Chan</HI> has a
Power to nominate his Successor, which is called
<HI>Galga,</HI> and commonly is either his Son, or one of
his Brothers. The Chief among his Subjects they
call <HI>Myrsas.</HI> Since <HI>Selim</HI> the Emperour of the
<HI>Turks</HI> took part of the <HI>Taurica Chersonesus</HI> from the
<HI>Genoeses,</HI> the <HI>Chans</HI> became Vassals, but not Tri∣butaries
to the Turkish Emperours, who as a To∣ken
of his Sovereignty, sends every new <HI>Chan</HI> a
Standard. Their first King or <HI>Chan,</HI> was one <HI>Vlan,</HI>
of whose Birth they relate strange Miracles. A∣bout
two hundred Years ago, this Family was set
asi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and the Family of the <HI>Gierey</HI>'s got into the
Throne in their stead, and enjoy it to this day;
<PB N="116" REF="66"/>
tho' there is some still remaining of the Family of
the <HI>Vlan</HI>'s, who are to succeed in the Throne, in
case the Family of the <HI>Gierey</HI>'s should happen to fail.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Strength.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Prince or <HI>Chan</HI> is able to bring a very nume∣rous
Army into the Field; which, when he Sum∣mons
together all the <HI>Hordes</HI> under his Jurisdiction,
and his Allies, amount to the number of 300000, all
Horse; for, they have no Infantry among the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI>
unless the <HI>Turk</HI> upon certain Occasions, send
some of his <HI>Janisaries.</HI> It is true, he keeps Garri∣sons
in some fortified Places in the <HI>Taurica Cherso∣nesus,</HI>
but their number is but small. The most
considerable is the Fortress of <HI>Precop,</HI> or as they
call it, <HI>Or,</HI> which however, is but indifferently
Fortified, as being surrounded but with a very slen∣der
Ditch, not above four or five Rod over, the
Ramparts which are of Earth, being neither regu∣lar
nor very high. He used always to keep here∣abouts
a good Body to Guard the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> compos∣ed
out of that <HI>Horde,</HI> which extends it self to∣words
the <HI>Boristhenes</HI> or <HI>Nieper.</HI> They don't very
religiously observe any Treaties with the <HI>Christians;</HI>
and, in the midst of Peace, will not forbear to
commit their usual Hostilities, by ravaging the
Country, sometimes by the <HI>Chan</HI>'s Orders, but for
the most pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, by his Connivance. It has been up∣on
this score, that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI> have
oftentimes, when their Affairs at home were not in
a good posture, been obliged to pay considerable
Sums to the <HI>Chan,</HI> which at other times upon a
more favourable Juncture, they have refused to
these Infidels, who claim'd it as a Tribute.</P>
<P>Their manner of making War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> is rather an Irru∣ption
than a regular War When these <HI>Tartars</HI>
have resolved upon an Expedition, either against
<HI>Muscovy</HI> or <HI>Poland,</HI> or sometimes against <HI>Hungary,</HI>
they most commonly make choice of the Month of
<HI>January,</HI> and of the Full Moon; when the Rivers,
Lakes and Fens, are all frozen over and covered
with Snow, this Season being most convenient for
them and their Horses, who can live upon any thing;
<PB N="117" REF="66"/>
whereas it must needs prove very inconvenient to
their Enemies, by reason of the difficulty of get∣ting
Forage and Provisions, and Encamping in so
sharp a Season as they do. Every one of them
carries at least two Horses, some more, into this
Winter Campaign, either to change them as occa∣sion
requires, or else to carry the Booty they get,
or what Provision they take along with them, which
however, seldom amounts to any more, than a
small quantity of Millet, and of dry'd or bak'd
Horses Meat; a great many making no other Pro∣vision
for themselves, but what their Horses tir'd in
the March, or else made unserviceable afford them.
The most redoubtable Enemies they have, if they
direct their March towards the <HI>Boristhenes</HI> or <HI>Nieper,</HI>
are the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> who being no less inur'd to Hard∣ships
than themselves, are always out upon Parties,
to get Intelligence, and upon the least Notice,
give the Alarum in the Country, and dispute their
Passage at some Advantageous Post or another. It
is for this reason they are obliged to March with
great Caution through Desarts and unknown Roads,
and, for fear of being discovered, Encamp in the
very midst of the Winter without Fire. Being come
near the Place where they intend to make an Irru∣ption,
their Generals detatch a third Part of the
whole Army, which being again divided into se∣veral
Bodies, they make their Excursions at ten or
twenty Miles distance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on both sides of the Army,
which in the mean while is kept ready in a Posture
to fight the Enemy, wherever there may be occasion;
The first Detatchment being return'd f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om Pillag∣ing,
the second is sent out, and at their return, the
third Part, till every one has had his Share in Ra∣vaging
round about the Camp, as far as they thought
it convenient for the space of five or six days, then
they retire as fast as they can, marching sometimes
60 or 80 Miles in 24 Hours, till they come to the
Great Plains, where thinking themselves secure by
reason of the Advantage they have in the vast num∣ber
of their Horses, they tarry there for some time,
<PB N="118" REF="67"/>
as well to recover themselves from the Fatigue
they have undergone in the Expedition, as to share
the Booty and Prisoners they have taken. They
sometimes make also an Irruption in the Sum∣mer-time,
which is commonly put in Execution by
the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Budziack,</HI> who seldom go into the
Campaign with above ten or twelve Thousand Men
at a time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartarian</HI> Armies are divided into very strong
Regiments or Troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Fighting.</NOTE> consisting of two, three,
and sometimes four Thousand Men; they seldom
Engage with their Enemies, except they know
themselves much Superior in Number; but, when
they cannot avoid fighting, they divide themselves
into a great many Bodies, and so make a running
Fight, our Forces which are obliged to keep their
Rank and Order, not knowing which of them to
Attack first, or with the most Advantage. Whilst
they are Retiring, they shoot their Arrows back∣wards,
as thick as Hail, which they do with the
greatest Dexterity imaginable, being the best Horse-Men
in the World, and Riding very short, with
their Knees bent, like the <HI>Poles, Arabians, Turks</HI>
and <HI>Africans,</HI> they at full Speed, raise themselves
upon their Stirrops, and with their Arrows gall their
Enemies Horse, and return as frequently to Charge
those that pursue them, as they find opportunity to
do it. This is however to be understood, when
they out number their Enemies, for else, if they
happen to be surprised, they run away full Speed,
and trust to the Heels of their Horses. But this is
very rarely done, they always keeping strong Out-Guards
at some distance from their Camp, either
near a River, or on some Eminency, from whence
they at a great distance, descry the approach of the
Enemy, being as quick-sighted as any People in
the World, and, so give the Alarum to the rest.
The Prisoners they take in these Expeditions, they
sell to the Merchants, which come from <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI>
and other Places belonging to the <HI>Turks</HI> in the
<HI>Levant,</HI> to <HI>Caffa;</HI> or else they keep them for their
<PB N="119" REF="67"/>
own Use, either to Cultivate the Ground, or to
look after their Cattle, where they must be con∣tented
with the same Food their Masters have, which
is commonly Horses Flesh half raw, which they
eat lying upon the Ground, after a very beastly
manner.</P>
<P>But this as well as most of the rest we have re∣lated
concerning the Manner of these <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> is to
be understood from such among them, as live in
the Great Plains (and these indeed are the greatest
part) a sort of a Vagabond Life, but for such as
inhabit within the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of the <HI>Taurica Chersone∣sus,</HI>
and have settled Habitations in Cities and Vil∣lages,
are much more civilised, making not
only use of Tables and Seats spread with Carpets;
and other sorts of Furniture, brought thither by
the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and other Merchants of the <HI>Levant,</HI>
but also their Dyet comes much nearer to that of
other <HI>Europaeans,</HI> making use of Bread, Mutton,
Fowl, Hydromel, and Aqua Vitae in their Houses;
and have their <HI>Mosques,</HI> like the <HI>Turks.</HI> They are
all bare-wall'd within, without any Painted or
Graven Image, for they ridicule the <HI>Russians,</HI> tel∣ling
them, That, <HI>when their Saints are grown old and
Worm eaten, they throw them into some River or an∣other,
from whence,</HI> says they, <HI>we perhaps take him
up, and broil a piece of Horseflesh upon it. A fine
God indeed, that is not able to resist those, that are go∣ing
to destroy it.</HI> But the Floor of these <HI>Mosques</HI>
are spread with Carpets, no body being allow'd to
come in with his Shooes on. The Day dedicated
for their Religious Service is the <HI>Friday;</HI> (perhaps,
because they will not have any thing common with
the <HI>Christians</HI> or <HI>Jews)</HI> when at Sun-rising they are
called together, not by the Ringing of Bells, but
by the Priest, who being seated in a certain Place
made for that purpose, on the top of the <HI>Mosque,</HI>
with a laudable Voice, exhorts them to repair thi∣ther.
Being met, he takes the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> written in
<HI>Arabick</HI> Letters in his Hand, and reads the Chapter,
which treats concerning the Manner, how to wor∣ship
<PB N="120" REF="68"/>
God; after which they sing certain Songs in
the praise of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and so depart to their re∣spective
Homes. They do not burn, but bury their
Dead, unless it be after a Defeat, when they ra∣ther
chuse to burn them, than let them fall into
the hands of the <HI>Christians;</HI> and for the rest, believe
the Transmigration of Souls.</P>
<P>We having frequently mentioned the <HI>Cosacks</HI> in
the Description of several of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Pro∣vinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Co∣sacks.</NOTE>
we will conclude this Chapter with a short
Account of their Origin, and what else may be found
remarkable among a barbarous multitude of People.
Those that have described the <HI>Cosacks</HI> as a particu∣lar
Nation, have been grossly mistaken in their O∣pinion.
For, before the Time of <HI>Sigismund</HI> the I.
they were no more than Volunteers or <HI>Freebuteers,</HI>
composed out of a wild and barbarous Rabble,
most of them Boors, that had left their Habitati∣ons
in the Neighbouring Provinces of the <HI>Polish Russia,
Wolinia</HI> and <HI>Podolia,</HI> and had settled themselves in
some Islands of the River <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> beneath <HI>Ki∣ovia,</HI>
where they lived upon Robbing and Plunder.
They were called <HI>Cosacks</HI> from their Agility (the
Word <HI>Cosa,</HI> intimating as much in the <HI>Polish</HI> Lan∣guage)
which chiefly consisted in passing betwixt
the innumerable small Islands, situate at the mouth
of the River <HI>Boristhenes.</HI> They used to commit
their Piracies, for the most part, upon the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
and are since that time, not only become for∣midable
to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallies, but also to <HI>Natolia</HI>
it self, where they did not only plunder <HI>Trebisond</HI>
and <HI>Sinope,</HI> but even the Suburbs of <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
and brought back their Prisoners and Booty safe to
their Habitatations, in the Isles of the <HI>Boristhenes.</HI>
Their Custom is to Cruise during the Summer in
the <HI>Black-Sea;</HI> but as soon as the Winter approaches,
these <HI>Freebuteers,</HI> return to the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> where
dispersing themselves, every one to his respective
Home, they before parting, appoint the Time of
their Rendezvouz against next Spring, in one of
these Isles, near the mouth of the <HI>Boristhenes.</HI> The
<PB N="121" REF="68"/>
great Exploits they had formerly done against the
<HI>Turks,</HI> had gain'd them no small Reputation among
the <HI>Poles;</HI> therefore <HI>Stephen Batori,</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran∣silvania,</HI>
and afterwards Elected King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
having considered with himself, that these <HI>Cosacks</HI>
might be of great use to the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI>
not only against the Incursions of the Neighbouring
<HI>Crim</HI> or <HI>Precopian Tartars,</HI> but also might serve as a
considerable Addition to the Strength of the <HI>Polish</HI>
Army, which consisting for the most part out of
Horse, would in effect, be rendred more formida∣ble,
when augmented by so considerable a Num∣ber
of Foot. It was upon this Consideration, he
resolved to put these Vagabond Soldiers into a good
Order and Discipline, which he effected, by
granting to them, besides their Pay, very conside∣rable
Priledges, and putting them under the Com∣mand
of a General of their own, with a Power to
chuse such Officers under him, as he esteem'd most
fit for Service. Having thus reduced them into one
Body, he gave them the City of <HI>Techtimoravia,</HI> with
all the Territories belonging to it, which being
seated upon the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> they made it their Ma∣gazine,
and the Residence of their Governour Ge∣neral:
And, to render this Body the more Service∣able
against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> he joyned to this Mili∣tia
of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> (being composed altogether of
Foot) two thousand Horse, for the Maintaining of
which he allotted the fourth Part of certain Reve∣nues
belonging to the Crown, from whence they
were called <HI>Quartans,</HI> and by corruption <HI>Quartians,</HI>
and were disposed upon the Frontiers, most ex∣posed
to the Incursions of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> By this
Means that Tract of Land, which from <HI>Bar, Brack∣lavia</HI>
and <HI>Kiovia,</HI> extends it self all along the <HI>Borist∣henes,</HI>
to the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and is now called the <HI>Vk∣raine,</HI>
which was before a desolate Country, was in
a little time fill'd with populous Cities and Towns.
As this Body has done considerable Services to the
Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> by maintaining its Frontiers a∣gainst
the Irruptions of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> so after some∣time
<PB N="122" REF="69"/>
time it proved very dangerous, having several times
taken up Arms against the Republick. For, being
once made sensible of their own Strength, they refus∣ed
to be obedient to the Orders of the <HI>Polish</HI> General.</P>
<P>Their first Rebellion was in the Year 1587,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Co∣sacks</HI> re∣bel.</NOTE> un∣der
their General, <HI>John Podkowa,</HI> but being van∣quish'd,
he had his Head cut off. In the Year 1596,
<HI>Sigismund</HI> III. King of <HI>Poland,</HI> upon Complaints
made by the <HI>Turks,</HI> forbid them to cruise in the
<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> which Orders they obeyed for that time,
but, soon after fell into the <HI>Polish Russia</HI> and <HI>Lithu∣ania,</HI>
where they Ravaged the Country, under their
General, <HI>Nalevaiko.</HI> In vain did the King send his
Orders for them to retire to their Habitations, they
on the contrary, resolved to maintain their Ground,
against the <HI>Polish</HI> Army, which was advancing a∣gainst
them, under the Command of the <HI>Polish</HI>
General <HI>Zolkieuski.</HI> The Battle was fought near the
City of <HI>Bialacerkiovia,</HI> where the <HI>Cosacks</HI> had the
better of it; but <HI>Zolkieuski,</HI> as he was a Great Ge∣neral,
having weather'd the Point for that time,
soon after got them into the Trap, so that they
were forced to submit, and deliver up their Gene∣ral,
<HI>Nalevaiko,</HI> who underwent the same Fate as
his Predecessor. In the Year 1637, the <HI>Cosacks</HI> re∣volted
again, the Occasion was thus: A great ma∣ny
<HI>Polish</HI> Lords, having Purchased Estates in the
<HI>Vkraine</HI> (the Quarter of the <HI>Cosacks)</HI> and observing,
that the Boors, their Vassals, run frequently over
to them, they were of Opinion, that their Reve∣nues
could never be well secured, as long as the
<HI>Cosacks</HI> enjoyed their Priviledges. Having there∣fore
represented them to the King, as dangerous to
the Republick, by reason of the great number of
Peasants, that daily ran over to them; it was re∣solved,
That the <HI>Polish</HI> General, <HI>Koniespolski,</HI> should
order a Fort to be erected at a certain Point of
Land, called <HI>Kudak,</HI> where the River <HI>Zwamer</HI>
falls into the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> which for its Situation,
they had chosen as a convenient Place to bridle the
<HI>Cosacks,</HI> as being not far distant from the place of
<PB N="123" REF="69"/>
their ordinary Rendezvouz. The <HI>Cosacks,</HI> who
were not so simple as not to penetrate into the De∣sign
of the <HI>Poles,</HI> resolved not to suffer the Bridle to
be put over their Heads, and having defeated Coll.
<HI>Marion,</HI> who was left there with 200 Men, to see the
Fort perfected, they assembled a considerable Bo∣dy,
to prevent the <HI>Polish</HI> General in his Design.
But at the very juncture of time, when they should
have been most unanimous, great Divisions arising
among the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> they revolted against their Ge∣neral,
<HI>Sawakonowiez,</HI> whom they Massacr'd, and in
his Place set up one <HI>Pauluck,</HI> of little Experience,
and less Conduct in Martial Affairs; The <HI>Polish</HI> Ge∣neral
having in the mean while taken this Oppor∣tunity,
to put the Fort in a state of Defence, they
marched out under their new General <HI>Pauluck;</HI>
but were surprised in the Plains near <HI>Korsun,</HI> be∣fore
they could Entrench themselves betwixt their
Waggons, according to their Custom, so that be∣ing
destitute of Horse, they were easily Defeated
by <HI>Potoski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the <HI>Polish</HI> Marshal <HI>de Camp.</HI> Those that
saved themselves by flight, got into <HI>Borovits,</HI> but
being immediately besieged by <HI>Potoski,</HI> and the
Place being not provided with Ammunition, they
were obliged to surrender their General, <HI>Pauluck,</HI>
with four more of their Principal Officers, who were
afterwards beheaded at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> notwithstanding
their Lives were secured to them by the Capitulation.
It was also decreed at the Dyet, held at the same
time at <HI>Warsaw,</HI> that not only all their Priviledges,
and the City of <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>htimoravia,</HI> granted to them
by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> should be taken from them, but
also a new Body of Militia should be erected in
their stead. But the <HI>Cosacks</HI> being not discouraged
at this Resolution, resolved also on their Side, to
try the utmost for the Recovery of their Liberty;
and after having protested to the <HI>Poles,</HI> that they
would remain steadfast to the Interest of that Crown,
provided they were maintain'd in their antient Pri∣viledges,
they fought a second time with <HI>Potoski,</HI> in
the <HI>Vkraine,</HI> but with not much better Success than
<PB N="124" REF="70"/>
before; so that finding their Circumstances desperate,
they Entrench'd themselves on the other side
of the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> upon the River <HI>Statcza,</HI> where,
during the space of two Months, the <HI>Poles</HI> attack'd
them at several times with great Vigour, but were
as often repulsed with all the Bravery imaginable;
so that, finding there was no good to be done with
these desperate <HI>Cosacks,</HI> they were forced to come
to a Capitulation with them, and to confirm all
their former Privileges, and to promise the Re-esta∣blishment
of their Militia upon the same Foot as
before, under the Command of their own Gene∣ral
chosen by the King. But this Capitulation was
almost as soon broken as made; For, no sooner
had they cajoled the <HI>Cosacks</HI> out of their advanta∣gious
Post, but most of them were either cut to
pieces or plunder'd by the <HI>Poles.</HI> Their Militia
was not re-establish'd, but another set up in their
stead, where no <HI>Cosacks</HI> were permitted to enroll
themselves. But scarce two Years were elapsed,
before the <HI>Poles</HI> had sufficient Occasion to repent
themselves of this Change. For the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who
before the Reform of these <HI>Cosacks,</HI> never durst so
much as approach these Frontiers, made a great Irru∣ption
into the <HI>Vkraine,</HI> and after having ruin'd all with
Fire and Sword, in the Tertitories of <HI>Pereaslaw, Cor∣fun,</HI>
and <HI>Wisnowitz,</HI> return'd home with a vast Booty,
and a great Number of Prisoners, according to their
wonted Custom. <HI>Ladislaus,</HI> therefore then King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> having duely weighed the Necessity there
was, to keep on foot this Body, upon which he
much relied, especially at that time, when he was
likely to be engag'd in a heavy War against the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> effectually restored them to
their former Condition, having given them for
their General, one <HI>Bogdan</HI> (or <HI>Theodore) Chmielnis∣ki.</HI>
But a great many of the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility ha∣ving
conceiv'd a mortal Hatred against the <HI>Cosacks,</HI>
miss'd no Opportunity of doing them what Mis∣chief
they could; Among the rest, a certain
<HI>Polish</HI> Gentleman, whose Name was <HI>Jarinski,</HI> did
<PB N="125" REF="70"/>
not only burn some Mills belonging to the General
of the <HI>Cosacks, Chmielniski;</HI> but also, after having
ravish'd his Wife, killed both her and her Son.
<HI>Chmielniski,</HI> being provok'd to revenge so barbarous
an Affront, after having demanded Satisfaction,
which was denied him, stirred up his <HI>Cosacks,</HI> who
with burning, plundering, and ravishing conti∣nually
pestered the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility; so that they
address'd themselves to King <HI>John Casimir,</HI> Brother
of the deceased King <HI>Ladislaus,</HI> desiring him to
march against them in Person, which he having
refused to do, they brought together an Army of
50000 Men, but were miserably beaten by the <HI>Co∣sacks;</HI>
and having a second time encountred them
without the King's consent, they received another
Overthow. To revenge this, they watch'd their
Opportunity, when <HI>Chmielniski</HI> was celebrating the
Nuptials of his Son with the Daughter of the
Prince of <HI>Moldavia;</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> then surprised the
<HI>Cosacks,</HI> plunder'd the City, and took the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Patriarch Prisoner. The General having sent to
the King to know whether it were done by his Or∣ders?
was answered no; but that the Nobility had
done it to revenge themselves upon the <HI>Cosacks.
Chmielniski,</HI> being vehemently incens'd against the
Nobility, entred into a League with the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
and entring <HI>Poland</HI> with a vast Army, the King
march'd against him in Person at the Head of a
Hundred thousand Men; The Battle was fought
near the City of <HI>Berestesko,</HI> on the River <HI>Ster,</HI> where
both the <HI>Cosacks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> were entirely routed,
though they were almost three to one stronger
than the <HI>Poles.</HI> Notwithstanding which, their Ge∣neral
<HI>Chmielniski,</HI> who escaped after the Battle, ha∣ving
re-assembled the Remainders of his broken
Army, so continually harassed the neighbouring
Country, that the King thought it most convenient
to come to an Agreement with them in the Year
1651. But the most of the Nobility being dissa∣tisfied
with the King's Proceedings, did let slip no
Opportunity that offered it self, to affront the
<PB N="126" REF="71"/>
<HI>Cosacks,</HI> but especially their General <HI>Chmielniski,</HI>
which obliged them about two years after, to wit,
in the Year 1653. to join with the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who
with their assistance, took in the Year nex follow∣ing
the City of <HI>Smolensko</HI> and <HI>Vilna;</HI> so, that it was
chiefly owing to their Valour, that the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
got into the Possession of the Provinces of
<HI>Smolensko,</HI> and <HI>Severia,</HI> and the greatest part of
the Palatinate of <HI>Kiovia,</HI> which were confirmed to
them by the Treaty of Peace, made at <HI>Oliva,</HI> in
the Year 1666. About which time the greatest
part of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> put themselves under the Pro∣tection
of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> the rest under the <HI>Turks,</HI>
whereby they opened the way to the latter into the
<HI>Ʋkraine,</HI> and <HI>Podolia,</HI> where two years after, they
took the famous Fortress of <HI>Caminieck</HI> from the
<HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>Out of what has been related concerning the
<HI>Cosacks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Retreating Place of the <HI>Co∣sacks.</HI></NOTE> it is sufficiently manifest, that they were a
certain Body of Soldiers, Established for the
Guard of the Frontiers. They used to be enrolled
in the Provinces of the <HI>Polish Russia, Volinia</HI> and
<HI>Podolia;</HI> and had originally but one City belonging
to them, which was the Residence of their Go∣vernour
or General. They were sirnamued <HI>Zaporo∣gian
Cosacks,</HI> to distinguish them from those living
upon the <HI>Don</HI> or <HI>Tanais;</HI> the Word <HI>Porochi,</HI> signify∣ing
in the <HI>Russian</HI> Tongue, as much as a Stone, or
Rock. At a considerable distance from the mouth
of the River <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> there are a great many
Rocks, lying so close together, that they seem to be
all of a piece, which render the passage of Ships
of Burthen, quite impossible, and takes away all
opportunity from the Inhabitants of the <HI>Ʋkraine,</HI>
to Transport their Wheat, and other Commodities,
which grow there in great abundance, to <HI>Constan∣tinople,</HI>
and other places. Some of these Rocks are
scarce to be seen above the surface of the Water,
others again rise above it, some six, some eight or ten
Foot, which occasion several dangerous <HI>Cataracts</HI> or
Water-falls, which are impassable to any body else
<PB N="127" REF="71"/>
but the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> in their light Ships. There are in
all, thirty of these <HI>Cataracts,</HI> some of which at
low Water, are twelve or fifteen foot high. No
body can pass among them for a true <HI>Cosack,</HI> unless
he have passed all these <HI>Cataracts</HI> (which they call
<HI>Porohi,</HI> and from whence they are called <HI>Zaporouski)</HI>
and consequently have made a Voyage upon the
<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> as the Knights of <HI>Maltha</HI> are obliged to
serve on Board their Gallies, before they are re∣ceived
into that Order: There are a great number
of Isles near these Rocks, but among the rest be∣low
the River of <HI>Czertomelick,</HI> there is a certain
Island, which is surrounded with several thousand
little ones, some of which have Sandy, others
Marshy Ground, but all of them covered with
Bulrushes, which render these Little Channels, by
which they are separated, almost invisible. 'Tis
into these narrow Passages and Watery <HI>Labyrinths</HI>
the <HI>Cosacks</HI> make their Retreat; they call them
<HI>Skarbnissa Woyskowa,</HI> which is as much to say, as the
<HI>Treasury of the Army,</HI> this being the Place whither
they carry all the Booty they Purchase upon the
<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> the Passage to it being difficult and dan∣gerous;
so, that most of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallies, that
pretended to pursue them here, have been lost.
This is also their Place of Rendezvouz.</P>
<P>The first thing they do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they go upon their Ex∣pedition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> after they have met here,
is to chuse their General, who is to Command in the
intended Expedition, which being done, they be∣gin
to work on their Ships, which they make them∣selves,
being about threescore Foot long, and a∣bout
ten or twelve broad, very slightly built, every
one having its Oars, some ten, others twelve, and
sometimes fifteen or sixteen. Their Sails are very
wretched, notwithstanding which, by the help of
their Oars, which they most rely on, they far ex∣ceed
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallies in swiftness. Their Pro∣vision
consists in Bisket, and some Barrels of boil'd
Millet; this is chiefly their Food; they seldom car∣ry
any Aqua Vitae or other Strong Liquors on Board
with them; and tho' they are as great Drunkards as
<PB N="128" REF="72"/>
any in the North, nevertheless, when they go upon
any Expedition, either by Sea or Land, they are the
Sobrest people in the World. When they are going to
cruise upon the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> they seldom exceed five
or six thousand Men, and there being commonly
threescore at a time employed in building each Ship,
they will get fourscore or a hundred of them ready
to be launched in three Weeks time. Fifty or Sixty
of them belong to each Ship, which has on board
five or six Falconets, each of the Men being
provided with a couple of Fusees, and Powder, and
Ball proportionable; They always stay for the last
Quarter of the Moon, that at their going out they
may not be discovered by the <HI>Turkish</HI> Gallies, which
are always ready in the Harbour of <HI>Oczakow,</HI> a City
situate at the Mouth of the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> to observe
their Motion. No sooner have they got the least
Int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lligence of their being abroad at Sea, but the
Alarm is taken immediately; which reaches quickly
to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> from whence Couriers are dispatch'd
without delay, to the Coasts of <HI>Natolia, Romelia,</HI>
and <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> to bid them to be upon their Guard.
But the <HI>Cosacks</HI> are generally to nimble for these
Messengers that are sent about to give these People
Advice of their coming: They know so well how
to take the Advantage of the Wind and Weather,
that they commonly are in forty Hours upon the
Coast of <HI>Natolia.</HI></P>
<P>When they descry a Ship or Gally, which they
can do at a great distance without being perceived
by them, their Vessels not baring above two Foot
and an half above Water, they approach to it as
near as they think convenient, towards the Evening;
when keeping at about three or four Miles distance,
they take exactly notice whereabouts the Ship is,
and what Course it takes; About Midnight they get
to their Oars, and, with all the haste they can,
make towards the Place where they think it most
likely to meet with the Ship; which being found
out, they surround, attack, and board it on all
sides, so that it being impossible for one Ship to de∣fend
<PB N="129" REF="72"/>
it self in the Night-time against so many, it is
soon taken. What Booty they meet with, either of Sil∣ver,
Cannon or Arms, or such Merchandices as are
of no great Burthen, they transport into their Vessels,
but the Ship they generally sink. But as they have
the Advantage over the Ships or Gallies by Night,
so, if they happen to meet them by Day, they sel∣dom
come off without bloody Noses, they being
not in a Condition to withstand their Cannon. It is
then their Swiftness stands them most in stead, and
they are secure enough from the Enemy's pursu∣ing,
when once they approach their little Channels,
and get among the Bulrushes. Whilst they were
under the Prorection of the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> the
<HI>Turkish Grand Seignior</HI> used frequently to make his
Complaints to the King of <HI>Poland</HI> against their Pi∣racies
in the <HI>Black Sea;</HI> but he used commonly to
receive the same Satisfaction the <HI>Poles</HI> have when
they make their Complaints at <HI>Constantinople</HI> against
the Incursions of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who dread no other
Enemy in the World so much as they do the
<HI>Cosacks.</HI></P>
<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Manner of Fighting by Land.</NOTE> as to their manner of Fighting by Land, it's to be
observ'd, that they are but very indifferent Horsemen,
but most excellent Soldiers on foot. They are inu∣red
to all sorts of Fatigues and Hardship, very o∣bedient
to their Commanders, and extreamly active
and dexterous in intrenching themselves, not only
in the ordinary Way, but also by making a Fence
of their Baggage-Waggons as they march along.
These moving Entrenchments are absolutely neces∣sary
for them, when they march without Horse in
open Plains and these Desarts of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> a∣gainst
whom they are forc'd to stand the Brunt
wherever they meet them: There has been several
Examples, that a thousand <HI>Cosacks,</HI> all Foot; thus
marching betwixt their Chariots and Waggons in a
Plain, have repulsed five or six thousand <HI>Tartars</HI> on
Horseback; their Horses as they are exceeding swift,
not being very strong, but are stopp'd by the least
Barracado that is put in their Way. This Way of
<PB N="130" REF="73"/>
Marching a whole Army in the midst of their Bag∣gage
and Ammunition Waggons, would scarce be pra∣cticable
in any other Country but <HI>Poland,</HI> which lies
all upon a Level, and consequently is the most pro∣per
for such a March in the World.</P>
<P>The Country inhabited by the <HI>Cosacks</HI> is called the
<HI>Ʋkraine;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Country of the Co∣sacks.</NOTE> which is as much as to say, lying upon
<HI>the Frontier;</HI> It borders upon <HI>Podolia,</HI> and is a Part
of the Palatinates of <HI>Kiovia</HI> and <HI>Braclovia;</HI> They
had made themselves entirely Masters of this, as
well as a great part of the <HI>Black Russia,</HI> but have
since been forc'd to abandon it, for the most part.
This Country extends it self from the 51. to the
48. Degree of Latitude; beyond which, to wit,
betwixt the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Palus Meotides</HI> as far as
the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> there are vast Plains (but deserted)
so fertile that the Grass grows near a Man's
height.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ʋkraine</HI> is a very fertile Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Uk∣raine.</NOTE> which
tho' scarce the third Part of it be cultivated, pro∣duces
such a vast quantity of Grains of all sorts,
that, for the most part, the Inhabitants don't know
how to consume it, wanting the Conveniency of
Exportation, their Rivers not being Navigable.
They abound also in all sorts of Cattle, Fowl, and
Fish, Honey, Wax, and Wood, fit not only for
Firing, but also for Building. The only thing they
Want is Wine and Salt. With the first of these two
they are supplied from <HI>Hungary, Transylvania, Wal∣lachia,</HI>
and <HI>Moldavia;</HI> besides that, they make ve∣ry
good Beer and <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> out of their Corn,
which together with their Hydromel, they make
use of instead of Wine. Their Salt they are fur∣nished
with out of the Salt-pits near <HI>Cracovia,</HI> or
out of the Country of <HI>Pokutia,</HI> upon the Borders of
<HI>Transylvania</HI> and <HI>Moldavia,</HI> where there are Salt-springs,
the Water of which being boiled produces a
very White Salt, very agreeable to the Taste, but
not so good for salting of Meat as some others are.
Their Houses are built of Wood, after the <HI>Musco∣via<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Fashion; and so are their Fortifications, made
<PB N="131" REF="73"/>
of Earth and Wood, which they account to be bet∣ter
Cannon Proof than Brick'd Walls, but are soon
set on fire.</P>
<P>The Rivers of Note here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Rivers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> are the <HI>Boristhenes</HI> or
<HI>Nieper,</HI> the <HI>Bog,</HI> the <HI>Niester</HI> or <HI>Tyras,</HI> the common
Border betwixt them and <HI>Wallachia,</HI> the <HI>Dezna,</HI> the

<HI>Cosacks,</HI> in the Year 1651, which proved fatal to
the last, and afterwards made them seek for Prote∣ction
among the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> The most
considerable Cities and Fortresses, which were once
in the Possession of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> are <HI>Kiovia,</HI> digni∣fied
with the Title of a Palatinate, and the Resi∣dence
of the Metropolitan of the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches

Braclovia</HI> upon the River <HI>Bog, Winnicza, Human,
Czernihow, Pereaslaw, Lubnie, Pawolocz, Chwastow,</HI>
all of them fortified within these Fifty Years; be∣sides
which there is scarce a Town or Village, but
what has something like a Fortification, or at least
a Ditch, which was intended, and serves them
for a Fence against the Incursions of the <HI>Tar∣tars.</HI></P>
<P>The Peasants of the <HI>Ʋkraine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Slavery of the Peasant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE> as well as of seve∣ral
other neighbouring Provinces, are absolute
Slaves; being obliged to work both with their
Horses and Hands, three or four Days in the Week for
their Lords. Besides which, they are forc'd to al∣low
them a certain Share out of all their Corn and
Fruit, the Tenth of all their Muttons, Swine, and
Fruits, and to carry Wood to their Landlords
Houses, and to do several other Services. But the
worst of all was, that before the last Wars, the
Noblemen used to farm out their Revenues here to
the <HI>Jews,</HI> who exacted these Services from the
Country People with the greatest Rigour imagina∣ble;
and had also monopolized the Brewing of Beer,
and Distilling of <HI>Aqua vitae.</HI> This occasioned them
to join so frequently with the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and to dispute
<PB N="132" REF="74"/>
so desperately their Liberty against the Nobility, who
in Consert with the <HI>Jews</HI> were the Occasion of these
many Revolts; and forced them at last to seek for an
end of their Misery among Foreigners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cosacks</HI> are generally tall, strong, and well∣set,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks.</HI></NOTE>
but especially very active; they are Liberal,
even to Profuseness, putting no great value upon
Riches, but are great lovers of their Liberty,
which they look upon as a thing inestimable; they
are Indefatigable, hardy, and brave; but great
Drunkards, and Treacherous; Their Employment
is Hunting and Fishing; besides which, they ap∣ply
themselves both to Agriculture, and the War.
They have also a particular way of making Salt-Petre,
great Quantities of which are carried to <HI>Dantzick,</HI>
and from thence transported, chiefly by the <HI>Dutch,</HI>

<P>The <HI>Cosacks</HI> have a certain Distemper common
with the <HI>Poles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plica Po∣lonica▪</NOTE> by the Physicians, called <HI>Plica Polo∣nica,</HI>
as being peculiar to that Nation, which in
their Language, they call, <HI>Goschest:</HI> Those that are
attacqu'd by this Evil, lose all upon a sudden,
the Use of their Limbs, and are tortured with most
horrible Pains all over their Body, which common∣ly
continues for a whole Year; after which, a
Sweat coming, which continues for a whole Night;
but especially in the Head, their Hair is the next
Morning all twisted together into one knotty Lock,
which has a very nauseous Smell, (from whence
some attribute the first Use of Hair-Powder, to
the <HI>Poles)</HI> but in a few days after, they are cured
both of their Lameness and Pain, but the Knot and
the Smell remain for ever; for if they cut it off,
the Remnants of the Humour, which purges it self
that way through the Pores of the Head, falls upon
the Eyes, and makes them blind. This Distemper
is as familiar in <HI>Poland,</HI> as the Itch in some Coun∣tries,
and what is worse, is very Infectious; It is
sometimes, like the Venereal Disease, communi∣cated
by Coition; there having been Instances, that
Children have brought this Distemper with them
<PB N="133" REF="74"/>
into the World, but as they grow up, it decreases
by degrees, and never returns afterwards. It is
look'd upon among them as incurable, except it be
by changing the Air, which must be done by going
into another Country: The Cause of this Distem∣per
seems to proceed from the great quantity of <HI>Ar∣senical</HI>
Mines, which are in <HI>Poland,</HI> and communi∣cate
their poysonous quality to the Waters, and con∣sequently
to their Body; which seems the more pro∣bable,
because abundance of their Horses are trou∣bled
with the same Distemper, and have such a
Knot either in their Manes or foretop, of which, if
there be the least part cut off, the Horse either dies,
runs mad, or becomes blind and lame; I have been
very credibly inform'd, that tho' the <HI>Poles</HI> look upon
this Evil as incurable, several Foreigners travelling
in those Parts have cured it with good Success, by
the same Method and Remedies, which are made
use of in the Venereal Distemper; which seems
sufficiently probable for several Reasons, not to be
alledged here, where our Scope is directed to Histo∣ry,
and not to Physick.</P>
<P>The Language of the <HI>Cosacks</HI> is a Dialect of the
<HI>Polish</HI> Tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Language and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣gion.</NOTE> as the <HI>Polish</HI> is a Dialect of the <HI>Scla∣vonian.</HI>
But that of the <HI>Cosacks</HI> is much more
smooth and full of Diminutives, which render it
very agreeable. The <HI>Cosacks</HI> themselves profess the
<HI>Greek</HI> Religion, in the same manner as it was e∣stablished
in <HI>Muscovy</HI> in the Year 942, by <HI>Ʋlodo∣mir,</HI>
or <HI>Wolodomir,</HI> Prince of <HI>Russia;</HI> but the great∣est
part of the Nobility of the <HI>Ʋkraine</HI> are either
<HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> or else <HI>Lutherans</HI> or <HI>Calvinists.</HI>
Within these Hundred and twenty Years, the
<HI>Greek Churches</HI> in these Parts, as well as in <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
acknowledged the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople</HI>
for their Head. But the Grand Dukes of <HI>Muscovy</HI>
having set up a Patriarch of their own chusing, the
<HI>Greek</HI> Bishops in these parts, not long after, to wit,
in the Year 1595, sent two Deputies to <HI>Rome,</HI> who
in the Name of the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches of <HI>Black Russia,</HI>
did represent to the Pope, in the Presence of many
<PB N="134" REF="75"/>
Cardinals, a Confession of Faith conformable to the
Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> reserving only to themselves the
Liberty of the Ceremonies practised in the <HI>Greek</HI>
Church after its Union with the <HI>Latin,</HI> at the
Council of <HI>Florence;</HI> but they did afterwards retract,
and acknowledged for their Ecclesiastical Head a
Metropolitan of their own, who for some time resided
at <HI>Kiovia.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Language, Habit, Manners and

<P>THE <HI>Muscovian</HI> Language is a Dialect of the
<HI>Sclavonian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Language.</NOTE> as well as the <HI>Polish;</HI> so that he
who understands either of these two, cannot be at
any great Loss for the <HI>Muscovian.</HI> The <HI>Sclavonian</HI>
being the Mother-Tongue of a great many Dialects,
is in great esteem among the <HI>Russians;</HI> their Bible
and such few other Books as they have, concerning
any Sciences, being not only writ in the <HI>Sclavonian</HI>
Tongue; but also those among the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
who pretend to any Degree of Learning above
the rest, always affect to make use of some <HI>Scla∣vonian</HI>
Words in their Writing, and Sheech, tho' in
the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Dialect; which indeed, among all
the rest, comes the nearest to the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> having
not the least Affinity with the <HI>Greek,</HI> except that
in their Liturgy, there are some Words borrowed
from thence, which however are not used any
where else. Their Character is that alone wherein
they have any Communion with the <HI>Greeks;</HI> but
they have not only much alter'd and transform'd,
but also considerably augmented them; so that their
Alphabet consists of Thirty eight Letters in Number,
<PB N="135" REF="75"/>
which I thought superfluous to insert here, since
Mr. <HI>Ludolph</HI> in his <HI>Russian Grammar,</HI> printed in the
Year 1696, at <HI>Oxford,</HI> has not only given a very
fair Delineation of them, but also treated with a
great deal of Exactness, the fundamental Parts of
this Language, and very methodically represented
its Affinity with the <HI>Sclavonian;</HI> to which I refer
the Curious.</P>
<P>As to their Habits,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ha∣bit.</NOTE> it is not unlike that of the
Antient <HI>Greeks,</HI> whom in this, as well as in several
other Respects, they are very ambitious to im∣tate.
Their uppermost Garment is a long great
Robe, reaching down to their Feet, with very
narrow Sleeves, but as long as the Coat it self,
which, when they dress themselves, they turn up in
several Pleats, and look upon it as a great Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eli∣ness▪
In the Winter they let them hang down, so
that they serve for a Muff; and sometimes to co∣ver
their ill Designs; for when they intend to rob
or cudgel any body, they hide in them their Cud∣gels
or Daggers. Persons of Quality have these
Robes of Sattin, Damask, or Cloth of Gold; Ci∣tizens
wear them of Violet, or dark green Colour,
and sometimes of red Cloth. The meaner Sort of
People, of a coarse dark-colour'd Cloth, such as is
made in the Country. In the Winter they l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e
them with Furrs, some with <HI>Sables,</HI> some with <HI>Er∣mins,</HI>
others with <HI>Martens,</HI> or some other sort, ac∣cording
to their several Qualities; but the Poor
People are contented with Sheep-Skin, which tho'
very convenient for keeping off the Cold, yet casts
out a Smell that is very offensive to the Nostrils.
These Robes they wear only when they go abroad,
over all the rest of their Cloaths, and are as to their
Fashion the same with those kept in the Grand
Duke's Wardrobe, for the Use of his <HI>Boyars,</HI> by
whom he is attended at publick Ceremonies. Un∣der
this they wear a close Coat, and under that a
Wastcoat. The close Coat is called <HI>Feres,</HI> which
comes down to the Calf of their Legs, open before,
with a very broad Collar falling down upon the
<PB N="136" REF="76"/>
Shoulders, with Gold or Silver Loop-Buttons, nay,
sometimes Embroidery from the top to the bottom▪
and on the side. The Sleeves like those of their
Upper Garments, being as long as the Coat it self,
but very Narrow. The Wastcoats which they call
<HI>Kaftan,</HI> comes down to their Knees, the Sleeves are
likewise so long that they cannot thrust out their
Hands without making Folds upon the Arm; The
Collars of these Wastcoats are almost like those of
the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> but much higher, covering the hinder
part of the Head, about half a quarter of a Yard
high. These Wastcoats, as well as the Justelau-Corps,
are made either of Callico, Taffata, Damask, or
Sattin, according to the several Qualities and Circum∣stances
of those that wear them. And because the
Collar of the Wastcoat, is, by reason of its Height,
very conspicuous, they either line it with Velvet, or
Cloth of Gold, and sometimes adorn it with Pearls
and precious Stones. Their Breeches are pretty
large, and gathered at the Waste, so that they may be
made streighter and wider as they please. Their Shirts
which they wear over their Drawers or Breeches,
girded under the Navel, are very wide, but short,
scarce covering their Thighs; they are not gathered
at the Neck like ours, but strengthned behind by a
triangular Piece, which comes down from the
shoulders to the Reins, and is sow'd down with
Crimson Silk; those that are more curious than the
rest, have little Fringes of Silk of the same Colour in
the Seams, and under their Arm-pits. The Vanity of
the richer Sort reaches yet further; for they have
their Neck and Wrist-bands, and where it is open at
the Breast, embroider'd with Silk, Gold and Silver,
and sometimes with Pearls and precious Stones; and
they leave open their Wastcoats before, that the
Embroidery and the Buttons of Gold, or Pearls, which
fasten the Shirt before, may be seen. The <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
wear no Hats, but, instead of them, Caps or
Bonnets, with a little Snip open before and behind,
to the form almost of a Pyramid, but not so much
peaked, near half an Ell high. The <HI>Boyars</HI> when
<PB N="137" REF="76"/>
they are present at any Publick Ceremonies have
them of black Fox-Skins or Sables; but when they
are absent from Court, or in their Houses, they
wear them of Velvet lined with these Furrs, with
narrow Brims (most like the <HI>Polonian</HI> Bonnets,
which are worn by most Strangers in <HI>Muscovy)</HI> and
laid over with Gold and Silver Loops, or embroi∣der'd
on the Sides with Pearl. The Poor People
wear in the Summer, White Felt or Cloth Caps,
patch'd together out of Shreds of Cloth, it being
very dear in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> of several Colours, which
in a manner resemble a <HI>Jack Pudding</HI>'s Cap, which
they line with the vilest sort of Fur they can get,
in the Winter; They are not near so convenient as
our Hats; for having no Brims, they don't afford
the same protection against the Sun, Wind, or foul
Weather. Their Boots, which generally they wear
instead of Shooes, are short like those worn by the
<HI>Polanders,</HI> and piked towards the Toes. But the
poor Peasant is his own Shoomaker; his Shooes he
makes of the Bark of a Tree wrought very thin,
and interwoven after the manner of Wicker-basket;
so that it is true beyond Contradiction, that no
Country in the World has such a Number of Shoo∣makers
as <HI>Muscovy;</HI> As for Stockings they are ne∣ver
regarded, among these poor Wretches, a piece
of Sheep-Skin or Cloth wrapt about their Legs and
tied fast with a Packthread, supplies the defect of
them; the rest of their Garments, which are of
the coarsest Canvass, being suitable to their Shooes and
Stockings. Persons of the first Rank shave their
Heads, except when they are under some Disgrace
with the Grand Czar, when they let their Hair grow
and hang carelesly over their Shoulders, as a Token
of their Affliction, in imitation of the Antient
<HI>Greeks.</HI> Those of a lower Condition keep their
Hair cut short; but the Priests wear it very long,
hanging down to the middle of their Backs. There
is no great difference betwixt the Mens Habits and
the Women; There is no strife here for the Breeches,
for the Wife wears them as well as the Husband,
<PB N="138" REF="77"/>
as they do in all other respects wear the same with
the Men. Their Robes are the same but something
wider, and the Sleeves are not so closely fastned to
them, but that they either may keep in or put out
their Arms at pleasure, and let the Sleeves hang by;
The richer Sort lay them all over with very thick
Gold and Silver Lace, or trim them Button and
Loop Fashion. They don't use these High Collars,
which the Men esteem as a singular Ornament; be∣sides
that their Smock Sleeves are prodigiously long,
generally four or five Ells, which they pleat in lit∣tle
Folds upon the Arm; and the Heels of their
Shooes are half a quarter of a Yard high. The
main difference is in their Head-dress. For they
wear very wide Caps or Coifs of Damask or Sattin,
made after a very fantastical Way; the Hair of the Casters
wherewith they are lined covering all the Forehead,
the outside being sometimes very richly embroider'd.
Maids that are marriageable wear them of Cloth
lined with Fox-Skin, and let their Hair hang down
their Backs in two Tresses, which they tye at the
End with a piece of Crimson Silk Ribband; but
the married Women put up their Hair under their
Caps or Coifs. Children under the Age of Ten
Years are not to be distinguished in their Habits;
both Boys and Girls have their Hair cut close to
their Heads, except two short Locks almost like
Mustachio's, which are left to cover the Temples;
only the Girls wear Rings of Gold, Silver or Brass
in their Ears. The <HI>Muscovites</HI> keep very constant
to the same Fashion; it being rarely to be seen
that any of them make use of a Foreign Dress
unless it be sometimes a Person of Quality, who
taking a particular Fancy to Strangers, perhaps
makes use of their Fashion when he goes in the
Country, or a Hunting. Formerly all Foreigners
of what Degree soever, used to go in <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Habits, till about fifty Years ago, the Patriarch ha∣ving
observed some of them to ridicule their Cere∣monies
when he gave the Benediction to the People,
prevail'd with the Grand Czar to forbid all Strangers
<PB N="139" REF="77"/>
living in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to appear for the future in <HI>Mus∣covian</HI>
Habits; but of late Years, they Cloath them∣selves
again after the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Fashion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> are of a middle Seize as to their
Stature, strong proportioned, of the same colour as
the other <HI>Europaeans</HI> in the Northern Parts. But they
much affect Corpulency, especially among Persons
of Quality. Long Beards, and great Mustachio's
are in great request among them, which they look
upon as tokens of Virility. So that a large Belly and
a great deal of Hair about the Mouth (for upon
their Heads they were little or none) are considered
here as peculiar Ornaments belonging to a
Man.</P>
<P>The Women in <HI>Muscovy</HI> are of a midling Stature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Muscovi∣an <HI>Women.</HI></NOTE>
neither too tall nor too little, and generally well
proportion'd before they are married, but after
they have had several Children, inclining to Fat∣ness,
by reason they do not keep their Bodies so
streight as our Ladies in these Parts, it being look'd
upon rather as a Comeliness than an Imperfection.
The Features of their Faces are not despisable, and
a great many among them might pass for very
Handsom in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> were it not for that
preposterous Custom received among all the Women
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> of what Age or degree soever, of
Painting their Faces, Necks and Hands. The worst
of all is, that having not attained to any kind of
Perfection in this Art, they paint so grossly, that it
appears no otherwise than if it had been done by a
Plaisterer; and notwithstanding this; whereas in other
places, Women make use of it as an Addition to their
Beauty, or a Concealment of their Deformity, a
great many of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Ladies, may very well
be said, to use it as a Veil to their Beauty; Pain∣ting
being so universally approved in this Country
that the Bridegrooms, among other Presents, send
it to their Brides, as we shall see anon, before we
conclude this Chapther. Besides which, they have
another Custom, which will perhaps appear as odd
as the former; which is, that they are as careful,
<PB N="140" REF="78"/>
and take as much pains in making their Teeth black,
as our Ladies do in keeping of them white, they
esteeming black Teeth an addition to their Com∣plexion,
with the same Intention, as our Ladies
make use of Patches. I am apt to believe, that
their Teeth being generally spoil'd by their Mercu∣rial
Paints, has obliged them to make a Vertue of
necessity, and by an universal Agreement, to cry
that up for an Ornament, which appears to us the
greatest Deformity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> are a People of great Wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Manners.</NOTE> Cun∣ning
and Dexterity, not wanting Ingenuity in any
thing they undertake, as has been sufficiently expe∣rienced
by those, who have had the Opportunity to
deal with them, either by way of Commerce or
otherwise; but they are withal, exceedingly proud,
jealous and insolent; besides that, they are addicted
to Drunkenness beyond any other Nation in the
World. They generally boast to be descended from
the antient <HI>Greeks,</HI> but to confess the Truth, as <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
was first beholding to <HI>Graecia</HI> for their Literature,
and Civilization; so it may rationally be conclud∣ed,
that the want of Conversation with the more
civilized part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the general Antipathy
they have against those Arts and Sciences, which
render'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> so famous in former Ages, has
made the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to appear so different
in their Manners and Customs, from most of the
other <HI>Europaean</HI> Nations. This will seem the more
probable, if it be taken into consideration, that
within these 30 or 40 Years last past, since which
time, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> have had more frequent Con∣versation
with Foreigners than formerly; and that
Encouragement has been given of late Years to∣wards
the laying the Foundation of several useful
Sciences; it must be acknowledged that they made
considerable Improvements as to several Matters
which formerly were odious, if not unsupportable
to civilized Strangers. They are accounted to be very
malicious in their Inclinations to one another. It
used to be a common Practice among them, for one
<PB N="141" REF="78"/>
to convey into another's Boots (when they carry their
Mony and Letters) either some Mony or other valua∣ble
Things, and afterwards accuse the Party of Theft;
to obviate this Evil, it was thought most expedient,
that it should be Enacted, for the Accuser to endure
the Torture first; and if while he was thus tortured,
did persist in his Accusation, the accused Person was
also to endure the same. Notwithstanding this,
there have not been wanting Examples, that even
Wives have accused their Husbands, and (that
falsely) of most enormous Crimes, and have en∣dured
the utmost violence of the Torture, to the
Destruction of them.</P>
<P>It is to the want of Education that must be ascri∣bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Quarrel∣somness.</NOTE>
their Quarrelsomness, and Insolences, being
guided meerly by Instinct, and acting in every re∣spect
according to their unbridled Appetites, unless
it be some Persons of the first Rank, who by their
Conversation, having been made sensible of these
Errors, manage themselves with much more Dis∣cretion.
For the rest, who have not had the same
Advantage, they do not shew the least Complai∣sance
to one another, unless it be upon the score of
Interest, when they are very ready with their Caps.</P>
<P>This occasions frequent Quarrels among them, so
that even in the open Streets, you may hear them
Rail at and Abuse one another, like Fish-Women,
and that with such Animosity in outward Appear∣ance,
that a Stranger would think it impossible they
could part without Fighting. They have one good
Quality, which is, that they seldom or never swear,
blaspheme, or curse in their Anger; but on the o∣ther
hand, they use the most horrible and reviling
Expressions, accusing one another of <HI>Sodomy, Bug∣gery,</HI>
and all other enormous Crimes they can think
of, and that very often, without any respect of Per∣sons,
nay, even betwixt Parents and Children. The
Government being sensible of the ill consequences
of these Insolences, used to send the Strelitzes and
Sergeants about to surprise some of these Offenders,
but the Evil was found so deeply and universally
<PB N="142" REF="79"/>
rooted, that in a short time, they would have
wanted hands to execute the Punishments, which
was Whipping. So, that for the Security of Per∣sons
of Quality, it was Ordered, That if any one
of them should be thus affronted, the Offender to
be obliged to pay a Fine (which they call <HI>Biscestia,</HI>
and at the most amounts to 500 <HI>l.</HI> Sterl.) according
to the respective Quality of the Persons injur'd.
And the better to keep in Awe those that had
little or nothing to lose, such, as were incapable
to pay the Fine, were to be put into their Adver∣sary's
hands, who either might make them their
Slaves, or else have them severely whipt by the Ex∣ecutioner,
whose place is, (to mention it here by the
by) Herditary; so, that the Sons serve their Ap∣prenticeship
in their Father's House. Notwithstanding
all these Precautions, this Fine is frequently paid,
even among People of very good Fashion, and Gentle∣men,
who do not forbear, upon the least Differ∣ence
to call one another Sons of Whores, Dogs,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which however is generally made up over a
large Cup of Aqua Vitae, for they seldom come to
Fighting, or if they do, when their Spirits are ex∣alted
by the Strength of the Liquor, it is done with
their Fists, or Switches, or a Cudgel, or perhaps by
soundly kicking one another about the Belly, for
in the heighth of their Rage, they are sure to aim
at the Codpiece; this being the utmost extent of
their Bravery in private Quarrels. For, a Man may
live a considerable time in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and not hear as
much as mentioned a Dewel with Sword or Pistol,
fought by <HI>Muscovites,</HI> as it is practised in other
Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> they, as it seems, not looking up∣on
Bravery and Courage to depend from these
Weapons.'Tis true, Persons of great Quality, to
distinguish themselves from the rest, commonly
fight on Horse-back, but their Weapon is a good
Whip, which decides the Difference without Blood∣shed.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="79"/>
They were formerly so fond of Ignorance, that
for any one to apply himself to the Study of any
Art, Science, or foreign Language, much more
to enquire into the State of Affairs of other Coun∣treys,
or Discourse of it, was look'd upon as a
great Crime. But matters are extreamly alter'd as
to this Point, of late Years, by the Encouragement
given by his present Czarish Majesty to the Nobili∣ty,
to make themselves acquainted with foreign
Countreys and Languages, and several useful Arts
and Sciences, especially the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> in which
they were so grossly ignorant before, that they
look'd upon its Effects no otherwise than Witch∣craft.
It is questionless owing to this gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Care of
the present Czar, that <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Schools
have been erected in the City of <HI>Musco;</HI> and
that some of the <HI>Boyars</HI> among other Languages
are well versed in the first of these two, which
will without question, in process of time, conduce
not a little towards the Reformation of such Abu∣ses
as have been hitherto in vogue in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
of which we shall have occasion to speak more
hereafter, before the conclusion of this Treatise.</P>
<P>The most familiar Vice the <HI>Muscovites</HI> are charg∣ed
with,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drunken∣ness.</NOTE> by Foreigners is Drunkenness, tho' most
of the other Countreys in <HI>Europe,</HI> especially the
Northern parts are infected with, as well as <HI>Mus∣covy.</HI>
It must be confess'd, that it is no where more
universal, than among the <HI>Russians,</HI> when the Clergy
as well as the Laity, the Women as well as the Men,
young and old, of what Quality or Degree soever,
have their share in it. <HI>Tzarkowino</HI> (for so they term
their <HI>Aqua Vitae)</HI> is the first welcom they give to
their Guests, even among People of the best Qua∣lity,
whether Men or Women, which goes merrily
round, before, at, and after Meals; Wine being a
Liquor too weak for their Stomachs. The Ladies
of Quality themselves, at their <HI>Poctivats,</HI> or great
Entertainments, make themselves so heartily mer∣ry
with it, that they are sensible of it the next day.
It is for this reason, the Lady of the Feast, sends
<PB N="144" REF="80"/>
the next day, one of her Gentlemen to Compliment
her Guests, to enquire after their Healths, and
how their Ladiships got home, and how they rested;
The general Answer the Lady sends is; <HI>I give your
Lady a thousand Thanks for her good Cheer, indeed it
made me so merry, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I scarce remember how I got
home.</HI> But to speak without Partiality, the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
are not the only People in the World, which
are intoxicated by the force of strong Liquor, the
very same is practised in <HI>Germany,</HI> where the Master or
the Mistress of the Feast, as well as the Guests do
not think the Entertainment compleat, if they go
home without Staggering. And as to what con∣cerns
the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Ladies, it is possible their merry
Meetings may meet with a favourable Construction
from such of our Ladies, as prefer the Charms of
Distill'd Waters, before Wine. Besides, that the
fair Sex in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> have a strong Plea to Alledge in
their own Defence: For as much as the great Quanti∣ty
of Fish they eat on their Fast-days, which make
up above half the Year, requires certain Digestives
to attenuate the Viscosity of this Dyet; and, that,
the merry Cup makes them, in some measure an
Amends for the solitary Life they lead at Home,
under the most rigid Discipline of their Hurbands,
of which, we shall have occasion to speak more
hereafter. On the other hand, it is most certain,
that the meaner Sort of People commit intolerable
excesses in this kind; for they will drink not only
till they can neither stand nor go, but oftentimes
till they die upon the Spot. To spend every <HI>Cope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
(or Penny) they have, in a Tippling-House, is a
common thing here; and thus far they may per∣haps
be match'd as well in this Kingdom, as some
others in <HI>Europe;</HI> but nothing is more frequent in
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> among the vulgar Sort, than to come
away without their Cloaths, nay, it often happens,
that if they come away with their Wastcoats on,
and meet one of their drunken Companions by the
way, they return, and send thus, Stockins, Waste∣coat,
Shirts and Drawers, after the rest, and re∣turn
<PB N="145" REF="80"/>
home like <HI>Adamites.</HI> It is easie to be imagin∣ed,
that there is no Mischief so great, no Vice so
abominable, but what is committed by these Drunk∣ards,
who, even when sober, very seldom act ac∣cording
to the dictates of Reason. Hence it is,
that so many Murthers are committed in the Streets
of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> so that it is unsafe to go
alone, or unarm'd in the Night-time, there
being sometimes fifteen dead Bodies to be seen to∣gether
in the Court of <HI>Semskay,</HI> a place where
they are exposed, that their Friends and Kindred
may take care for their Burial. If no body owns
them, they are thrown some where or another in a
Ditch. From hence also proceed these frequent Ir∣regularities,
Disorders and Excesses in Debauche∣ries,
even to sin against the Course of Nature, not
only with Men, but also with Beasts. The Wo∣men
of the meaner Sort, tho' otherwise kept un∣der
a very strict Discipline, will often find out
their Husbands at the Tippling-House, and drink
with them to that Excess, till they can neither
stand nor go, and are obliged to lay down among
them at the Tippling-House. Several of the
Great Dukes have attempted to put a stop to this
Evil, by ordering such Publick-houses as were al∣low'd
of by their Authority, to sell their Liquor
only by certain Measures at a time; but this prov'd
ineffectual, the Neighbours meeting by turns at
their own Houses, where they play'd the same
Game, they were used to, at the Tippling-Houses.</P>
<P>Formerly Tobacco was as extravagantly taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tobacco forbidden.</NOTE>
as the <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> and was the Occasion of fre∣quent
Mischiefs; forasmuch as not only the poorer
Sort, would rather lay out their Money upon To∣bacco
than Bread, but also, when drunk, did set
their Houses on Fire through their Negligence.
Besides (which made the Patriarch take a particu∣lar
Disgust at it) they used to appear before their
Images with their stinking and infectious Breath;
all which obliged the Great Duke, absolutely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
forbid both the Use and Sale of Tobacco, in the
<PB N="146" REF="81"/>
Year 1634, under very rigorous Punishments;
to wit: For the Transgressors to have their Nostrils
slit, or else to be severely whipt. Nevertheless, it
is of late Years more frequently used, than ever it
was before since the time of the Edict, the Search
being not now so strict against the Takers, nor the
Punishment so rigorously executed. Foreigners
having the Liberty to use it, makes the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
often venture upon it in their Company; they be∣ing
so eager of Tobacco, that the most ordinary
Sort, which formerly cost not above 9 or 10 Pence
<HI>per</HI> Pound in <HI>England,</HI> they will buy at the rate of
fourteen or fifteen Shillings; and, if they want
Money, they will truck their Cloaths for it, to the
very Shirt. They take it after a most beastly man∣ner,
instead of Pipes, they have an Engine made
of a Cows-horn, in the middle of which, there is
a Hole, where they place the Vessel that holds the
Tobacco. The Vessel is commonly made of Wood,
pretty wide, and indifferently deep; which, when
they have fill'd with Tobacco, they put Water in∣to
the Horn to temper the Smoak. They common∣ly
light their Pipe with a Firebrand, sucking the
Smoak through the Horn with so much Greediness,
that they empty the Pipe at two or three Sucks;
when they whiff it out of the Mouth, their rises
such a Cloud, that it hides both their Faces and the
Standers by. Being debarr'd from the constant use
of it, they fall down drunk, and insensible im∣mediately
after, for half a quarter of an Hour,
when the Tobacco having had its Operation, they
lep up in an instant, more brisk and lively than
before, when their first Discourse commonly tends
to the praise of Tobacco, and especially of its
noble Quality in purging the Head.</P>
<P>For the rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mus∣covite,</HI> are hardy and reso∣lute.</NOTE> the <HI>Muscovites</HI> are from their In∣fancy
inur'd to all sorts of Hardship, their Children
being seldom suckled above two or three Months;
and this with the coldness of their Climate, and their
sparing Diet, makes them very fit to endure the
Fatigues of War, being especially very resolute in
<PB N="147" REF="81"/>
defending of Places; which they will maintain to
the utmost extremity; I will only alledge here for
an Instance, the Siege of <HI>Noteburgh,</HI> where the
Garrison was reduc'd to two Men, before they
would hearken to a Capitulation; this happen'd in
the Year 1579,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Soldi∣ers in Gar∣rison.</NOTE> when the <HI>Poles</HI> had besieged the
Castle of <HI>Svikols,</HI> fortified after the <HI>Russian</HI> Fashion,
with wooden Fortifications, as they were giving
the Assault, had set it on Fire; yet the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
made good the Breach, and were seen to maintain
their Ground, when their Cloaths were on fire. An∣other
example of their Resolution may be given in
the Siege of the Abby of <HI>Paedis</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> where
they were reduced to such Extremity for want of
Provisions, before they would Capitulate, that they
were no longer able to stand upon their Legs, or to
be upon their Duty, and were not able to meet the
<HI>Swedes</HI> at the Gate, when they took Possession of
the Place. It must be confess'd, that they have
seldom had any great Advantage against the <HI>Poles</HI> or
<HI>Swedes</HI> in the Field, but the most understanding in
Martial Affairs have attributed it more to the de∣fect
of their Officers, than the Courage of the
Soldiers; the first being not to be compared to the
<HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> neither for Experience or Con∣duct;
as it happen'd at the Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI>
where the <HI>Muscovites</HI> received that Disgrace, if not
by the Treachery, at least by the ill Conduct of
their Generals. It has, questionless, been for this
Reason, That the Czars of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> have for a
considerable time past, and do to this day employ
abundance of foreign Officers in their Armies; and,
it is very probable, that, since a great number of
the <HI>Cosacks</HI> have embraced the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tection of the
Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> they may prove more formida∣ble
in Battles than they have done hitherto They
are very good at keeping Secrets, especial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in what
relates to their own Affairs, or the Publick, in
which respect they are so over-jealous, that they
will scarce allow any Stranger to cast his Eyes up∣on
any Strong-hold, tho' of very small consequence,
<PB N="148" REF="82"/>
and scarce worth taking notice of; much less, that
they should be easie in informing them in any thing,
tho' of never so l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle moment, which makes it
very difficult for Strangers to be truly informed of
the Constitution of their Country, unless it be by a
very long Conversation. It is upon this score, that
all Strangers at their first arrival in the City of <HI>Mus∣co,</HI>
except such as bear a publick Character, are ob∣liged
to pass their Examination in the <HI>Chancery,</HI> in
the presence of several Registers, who after having
asked them as many Questions as they think conve∣nient,
put down in Writing their Depositions. The
<HI>Muscovites</HI> are reckoned to be great Game<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters at
Chess, as any are in the World, and many among
them will take now and then a Turn at Dice.
They are of late Years, become very industrious
in their way of Trading, questionless, by their fre∣quent
Commerce with the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
last of which they strive to imitate, not only in
this, but several other Matters, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> be∣ing
more ingenious at imitating, than inventing.</P>
<P>The Women in <HI>Muscovy</HI> have an extraordinary
Respect for their Husbands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> they live exceedingly
retir'd, and very seldom appear in Publick. Vir∣gins,
if they be of any Quality, live under as much
if not more Restraint than the Women; for besides
that they are very seldom allow'd to go abroad,
when they do, they are always covered with a
Veil, to prevent their being seen; so that many
times they marry here before they have as much as
look'd upon one another. Both their Women and
Maids, if they be of any Quality, being not edu∣cated
to any thing of Houswifry, and making or
receiving few Visits, lead a very idle Life; having
no other Employment, but perhaps a little Embroi∣dery
of Silk upon a Handkerchief of white Taffeta,
or a Purse, or some such like thing. For the rest
their Diversion is to have Ropes fastned to swing in,
or else they lay a long Plank over a Block, and
mounting one at one end and another at the other,
they toss themselves up and down by a very violent
<PB N="149" REF="82"/>
Motion. They have also publick Engines to swing
in, not unlik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to those used by the Boys and Girls
in <HI>Moor-fields</HI> and <HI>Bartholomew</HI>-Fair, so contriv'd
as that four can sit at an equal distance, and so
swing continually by the Counterpoise they give
one another; so that while some swing up pretty high
in the Air, the others fall successively near as low
as the Ground, till they are tir'd with the Sport:
This is done in the open Streets, where certain
Boys keep these Swingers for that purpose, and
have two, three, or four Pence for such a merry
Bout. The Young Men at their Festivals, for their
Pass-time, play at Fisty-cuffs or Cudgels; some
exercise themselves in Wrestling, and in the Winter,
with Scates upon the Ice, as they do in <HI>Holland.</HI>
Fornication is look'd upon among them as a slender
Trespass; and though they don't permit Publick
Stews, yet they are not very backward in doing
one another a Kindness, especially when they are
Flush'd with good Liquor. They don't count it
Adultery, for married People to have secret Con∣versations
with one another in the same manner as
we do in these Parts; Adultery is not committed
here, unless a Man marry another Man's Wife; all
the rest comes within the Compass of bare Forni∣cation;
with this Difference however, that if a
married Man be taken in it, he is punished with
some Days Imprisonment, or perhaps to live for
some Days upon Bread and Water, or sometimes al∣so
with a Whipping; where, by the by, it is to be ob∣served,
that Whipping is not accounted so scandalous
in <HI>Muscovy</HI> as in other Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> Persons of
the best Quality having been sometimes so unfortu∣nate
here as not to escape the Lash. But if the
Wife chances to be convinced of a Miscarriage of
this Nature, she does not come off at so cheap a
rate; for besides a good sound Cudgelling or Whip∣ping,
which she is sure to receive very bountiful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
from her Husband, she is shav'd and put into a
Monastery, unless the Husband be pleas'd to pardon
the Fault.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="83"/>
They are great Admirers of Vocal Musick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theire Musick.</NOTE> for
Instrumental Musick, they have little or none, un∣less
it be Bagpipes, and what belongs to their War∣like
Musick; to the first they bring up their Chil∣dren
with great Diligence and Severity in Schools
erected for that purpose; Their Notes are as diffe∣rent
from ours as their Characters of the Alphabet, and
in all probability are borrow'd either from the <HI>Greeks</HI>
or <HI>Sclavonians.</HI> Their Gamut has but small Variety,
and instead of our <HI>Fa, sol, la,</HI> they sing <HI>Ga, ga, ge,</HI>
Their Cadenecs and Closes are unexpected, and, as
it were, upon the surprise; and indeed, in the
main, not in any way approaching to that Perfecti∣on
which is in most other Countries of <HI>Europe.</HI> As
for their Warlike Musick they have Kettle-Drums
and Trumpets for their Cavalry, but the first don't
sound so well as ours do, and as for their Trum∣peters,
they are but very indifferent Artists, and
have not been very many Years in use in <HI>Muscovy.</HI>
But their Hautboys which the Infantry make use
of in the Wars, are very passable. In their Hunt∣ing
they use Brass Bugles, which make a hideous
Noise. Their Beggars all beg singing with a very
strenuous Voice. The better Sort don't much e∣steem
Dancing, as believing it unbecoming of their
Gravity: But those that apply themselves to it,
rather dance for the Diversion of others than to
please themselves. They use strange Distortions
with their Hands, and Shoulders, but especially their
Back-sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and hopping upright with their Feet,
scarce move from the Place. The <HI>Muscovites</HI> exer∣cise
the Venereal Act with a great deal of Gravity
and Circumspection; for they will never have to
do with a Woman, unless they first take off the lit∣tle
Cross which is hang'd about her Neck when she
is Christned; and they are so considerate in their
Love-Passion, as first to cover the Images of their
Saints, if there be any in the Room. For the rest,
their chief Penance for Trespasses of this Nature is
Bathing, which they also make use of, not only
at other times, but especially at their Marriages,
<PB N="151" REF="83"/>
after their first Coition. All <HI>Muscovites,</HI> of what
Degree or Condition soever, sleep after Dinner,
so that about Noon the Shops are shut up, and there
is no more speaking with any Body than if it were
about Midnight. Both Bathng and Sleeping after
Dinner is so general a Custom in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> who personated the Son of the Czar
<HI>John Basilowitz,</HI> was first suspected to be an Impo∣stor
and stranger, because he never bathed himself,
nor slept after Dinner, as we shall shew hereafter.</P>
<P>Their Stoves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Bathing-places.</NOTE> or Bathing-places, are close Places
with Furnaces, which they heat exceedingly, and
for the better Excitation of Vapours, frequently
cast cold Water upon this Stove. There are Bench∣es
all round about at some Distance one above a∣nother,
differing in degrees of Heat, which are
chosen by every one according to his own Conve∣niency.
Upon one of these Benches they lay
themselves at full length, stark naked, and after
they have sweat as long as they think it convenient
by the Help of these hot Vapours, they are well
wash'd with warm Water, and well rubb'd with
Handfuls of Herbs. After which they aften take a
Dram of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and so go their ways. But
what is most admirable, is, that when they find the
Heat too intense, both Men and Women will run
out of the Stoves stark naked, either straitways
into cold Water, or cause it to be pour'd upon
them, nay, in the Winter, they will wallow in the
Snow. There is scarce a Town or considerable
Village in <HI>Muscovy</HI> which has not some of them;
People of Quality have their private ones; and
those of the <HI>Germans</HI> that live in <HI>Muscovy</HI> out-do
the rest, both in Neatness and Conveniency; tho'
a Man bathes in them, a Servant Maid, only in her
Smock, rubs, washes, and wipes him, and so after
some Refreshment of Wine, a Toast and Nutmeg,
Citron Peel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he goes to Bed: But, besides this,
there are a great Number of Publick Bathing-places
every where. These are often so carelesly built,
that it is easie to look out of one Room into the o∣ther
<PB N="152" REF="84"/>
thro' the Distance of the Boards that part them,
which they look upon here as a Matter of no great
Consequence, though either Sex has nothing else to
hide their privy Parts but a Handful of Herbs
moistned in Water, which a great many don't
think it worth their while to make use of, being
not very shy to be seen by Men, when they are go∣ing
out to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol themselves in cold Water, both
Sexes commonly going out and in at one and the
same Doo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to their Bathing-rooms. These Baths
are the universal Remedies of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> not
only for cleansing their Bodies, but also for the
Preservation of their Health, which being thus from
their Infancy inur'd to the greatest Extremities of
Heat and Cold, makes them to be of a very strong and
healthy Constitution, and for the generality long
liv'd, and very seldom troubled with any Distem∣pers;
which if they are, their <HI>Panacea</HI> is a hearty
Draught of the best <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> fortified with Gar∣lick,
and sometimes Pepper, tho' it be in a very
high Fever, they not knowing of any other Evacua∣tion
but what is wrought thro' the Pores of the Bo∣dy.
Thus they live, for the most part, without
Physicians, and many of them without Diseases;
yet, since the last Wars with the <HI>Poles,</HI> they have also
made a very intimate Acquaintance with the Vene∣real
Disease, which, in so cold a Climate as theirs,
sticks very close to them; especially, since it may
rationally be believ'd that Physick does not appear
here in its utmost Perfection; tho' it be undeniable,
that Physick and Physicians have, for many Years
past been highly esteem'd by the Czar and the No∣bility.</P>
<P>Their Way of Saluting is by putting off their
Caps; and if they intend to pay a more than ordi∣nary
Reverence, they decline their Head very low
towards the Ground, without moving their Feet.
The Women use the same Way of Saluting, only
that they bow very slowly, letting their Hands
hang down by their Sides and never<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> touch their
Bonnets. When a <HI>Muscovite</HI> intends to shew the
<PB N="153" REF="84"/>
greatest piece of Civility he is capable of to a Stran∣ger,
he brings to him his Wife attir'd in her best
Apparel, to salute her with a Kiss. Your ordinary
Citizens, or Peasants, when they appear before
their Magistrates or the Nobility, bow to the very
Ground, prostrating themselves and beating their
Foreheads to the Ground; The same Reverence is
paid to the Czar, even by the greatest Men in the
Kingdom. This extraordinary Respect paid by
the Commonalty to the Nobles makes them appear
so extreamly haughty and jealous of their Autho∣rity,
that Strangers, tho' of the first Quality, rarely
meet with that Civility they might reasonably claim
according to their respective Stations, unless it be
from some who are acquainted with the Customs of
Foreign Countries.</P>
<P>They begin their Day at the rising of the Sun,
and end it at the setting; so that their Night be∣gins
as soon as the Sun is down, and ends when it
rises. Their Year they begin on the first of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
because they use no other Epoche than from
the Creation of the World, which they suppose
was in Autumn. And whereas we account from
the Creation of the World to the Nativity of Christ
Three thousand, Nine hundred, and Sixty nine
Years; they following the Footsteps of the <HI>Greeks,</HI>
reckon Five thousand, Five hundred, and Eight.
So that in the Year 1697, they reckon in <HI>Muscovy</HI>
7209 Years from the Creation of the World,
whilst we account but 5720. They solemnize
their New-year's Day with great Processions in all
the considerable Towns of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>Their manner of Travelling is extreamly com∣modious,
especially in the Winter, when their
Sleds glide away on the surface of the Ice or Snow
in a flat Country, with incredible Swiftness, and
very little Inconveniency to the Horses, so that
they will travel 50 or 60 Miles a day. These Sleds
are made of the Bark of the Linden-tree, fitted to
the length and breadth of a Man; they line them
with some thick Felt, and when a Man is laid in
<PB N="154" REF="85"/>
them along, he is covered and wrapt up over Head
and Ears in good Furs: The Carter runs, for the
most part, by the Sled, to warm himself, and
sometimes sits at the Feet of the Person that rides
in the Sleds, where he is sure to comfort himself
with a Drachm of the Bottle. These Sleds being
very low built, if they happen to over-turn, are
not very dangerous. The Ladies Sleds, being co∣vered
on all sides, in the Fashion of a Coach, are
much higher and heavier, and therefore more dan∣gerous.
Whilst they travel thus, the Time is past
away, for the most part, with Sleeping, the easie
and insensible motion favouring the Repose of the
Traveller. When they happen to pass through De∣sarts
and great Forests, where they are obliged to
remain all Night in the open Air, they kindle a great
Fire, and round about it range their Sleds; so, that
being well clos'd up on all sides, and covered
all over with Furs, they sleep more commodiously,
than in a Country Cottage, where Men and Beasts
being all together lodged in one Room, greatly
disturb a Man's rest. In the Summer they travel
either by Water upon the Rivers, wherewith this
Country is stor'd every where, or else by Land, on
Horseback, by Coach or Waggon, the Roads in
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> being very broad, beautiful and easie for
Travelling. By Water they make use of certain little
Boats, made all of one Piece, of the Trunk of a
Tree made hollow, in which they stand upright,
and row over the Lakes and Rivers. These Boats
being very light, a Man goes a great way in them in
a little time; but they have this Inonvenience, that
if not exactly counterpoiz'd, they soon turn over.
They have also certain Floating Bridges, made of
pieces of Firr joyn'd together, which bear them∣selves
up upon the Water. The greatest inconveni∣ency
in Travelling here is, that in the Country
there are no Inns or Houses of Entertainment for
Travellers, so that they are obliged to carry along
with them what Provisions and other Necessaries
they stand in need of. Besides that, the violent
<PB N="155" REF="85"/>
Heat in the Summer, and the prodigious quantities
of Flyes, are very troublesome, and interrupt the
Pleasure which a Stranger else might take in the
Beauty and Variety of their Forests, Brooks and
Lakes.</P>
<P>Marriages is accounted honourable among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Marri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ges.</NOTE>
and Polygamy forbidden. They may Marry twice,
but to do it the third Time, is accounted Scanda∣lous
and Immoral. They are very Superstitious in
observing the degrees of Consanguinity, and sel∣dom
Marry those that are any wise near to them by
Kindred or Alliance. Two Brothers are not per∣mitted
to Marry two Sisters, neither are God-fa∣thers
and God-mothers to the same Person, to in∣ter-marry.
There is no such thing as Wooing here
betwixt the young Couple, Gallantry and Court∣ship
the Preliminaries of Love, which insensibly
insinuate into the Mind, and captivate our Hearts,
are look'd upon here as Chymera's, Marriage being
considered as a necessary Evil. Young Men and
Maids are not suffered to see, much less to have
any Conversation with one another, so, as to talk
of Marriage, or to be able to make the least Pro∣mise
by Word or Writing. It is transacted by way
of Brokeridge, so that it is no difficult Matter to
put a Counterfeit upon the Bridegroom, provided
the Parents do but consent to it; in the same man∣ner,
as <HI>Laban</HI> put the Bleer-ey'd <HI>Leah</HI> upon <HI>Jacob,</HI>
instead of the Beautiful <HI>Rebeckah,</HI> which is fre∣quently
practised in <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Their general way
of Proceeding is thus: If any one have a Marri∣ageable
Daughter, whom he is willing to bestow
upon a certain young Man he approves of, he ei∣ther
by himself, or his Broker, declares his
Mind to the young Man's Parents, or for want of
them, to one of the next Kindred. If the Match
be accepted of, two or three Women, deputed by
him that is to be the Bridegroom, are permitted
to take a full view of the future Bride, stark na∣ked,
to see▪ whether she has any Defect; after
which, their Friends on both sides treat of, and
<PB N="156" REF="86"/>
Conclude the Marriage, the intended Couple not
being allow'd to see one another, till they meet in
their Bed-Chamber, after Marriage.</P>
<P>When a Marriage is concluded betwixt Persons
of Quality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage Cerem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</NOTE> there are two Women appointed, one
on the Bridegroom's, the other on the Brides side,
(they call them <HI>Suacha</HI>'s) whose business is jointly
to take Care for the Nuptials. The first business of
her that is appointed on the Brides side, is to pre∣pare
the Nuptial-Bed. She, attended by a great
many other Servants, who carry all Things neces∣sary
for the Bed and Chamber, goes on the Wed∣ding-Day
to the Bridegroom's House, where the
Bed is made upon forty Sheaves of Rye, compass∣ed
about with several Barrels full of Wheat, Barley
and Oats. The same Evening the Bridegroom,
accompanied by his Kindred, goes on Horseback,
with the Priest before him, to the Brides House,
where being met at the Door, and received by all
her Friends, they are all invited to sit down at a
Table, with three Dishes of Meat upon it. Whilst
the Bridegroom is busie in receiving the Compli∣ments
of the Brides Friends, a young Lad gets in∣to
his Place at the Table, from whom the Bride∣groom
is forced to purchase the Place by some
Presents; when he has taken his Place, the Bride
is brought into the Room, most richly Clad, but
Veil'd, and seated by the Bridegroom, but sepa∣rated
by a large Piece of Crimson Taffeta, held
up betwixt them by two young Lads. This done,
the Brides <HI>Suacha</HI> paints her, tyes up her Hair in
two Knots, puts the Crown on her Head, and
dresses her like a Married Woman. Whilst the other
<HI>Suacha</HI> is busied in Painting the Bridegroom, the
Women sing several foolish Songs. After that,
two young Lads in very rich Apparel, bring into
the Room on behalf of the Bridegroom, a very
large Cheese and some Loaves; the like being done
on the Brides part, the Priest blesses them all, and
sends them to Church. As they are ready to go to
Church, there is a Silver Basin put upon the Table,
<PB N="157" REF="86"/>
fill'd with little pieces of Sattin and Taffeta, little
pieces of Silver, Hops, Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey and Oats, all mix'd
together. The Brides Face being covered again,
the <HI>Suacha</HI> takes certain Handfuls out of the Basin,
which she casts among the Company, who in the
mean while sing a Song, and pick up what they
find upon the Ground.</P>
<P>When they come to Church, the young Couple
standing upon a piece of Taffeta, receive the Be∣nediction
from the Priest, which is performed by
holding Images over their Heads. The Priest takes
the Bridegroom by the Right, and the Bride
by the left Hand at the same time, asking them
three times consecutively, <HI>Whether they are both sides
willing and content to Marry, and to Love one another?</HI>
After they have both answered, Yes, all the Com∣pany
join Hands, and the Priest begins to sing the
first Verse of the 128 <HI>Psalm,</HI> the Company singing
the next, and so continue to sing by Turns to the
End of the <HI>Psalm,</HI> the Company dancing all this
while. The <HI>Psalm</HI> being ended, the Priest puts a
Garland of Rhue upon their Heads; but if a Wi∣dow,
or a Widower, about the Shoulders, saying,
<HI>Increase and multiply,</HI> and Consummating the Mar∣riage
with these Words: <HI>Whom God has join'd, let
no Man separate.</HI> In the mean while, those that
are present, lighting each of them a Wax-Candle,
fill the Priest a Glass with Red Wine, which he
takes off, and the Married Couple having pledg'd
him, by drinking it off, each of them, three times;
the Bridegroom throws down the Glass, and both
of them treading it to pieces under their Feet,
pronounce these Words: <HI>May they thus fall at our
Feet, and be trod to pieces, who shall go about to
sow Division or Discontent between us.</HI> Then the Wo∣men
there present, cast some Flax-seed and Hemp∣seed
at the young Couple, wishing them much Joy
and Prosperity, and pulling the Bride by her Robe
(as if they would pull her away from her Husband)
but she keeps very close to him, and renders their
Endeavours fruitless; Then, by the Light of se∣veral
<PB N="158" REF="87"/>
Torches or Wax-Candles, they all return to
the Bridegroom's House, where the Wedding is
kept▪ No sooner are they entred the House, but the
Bridegroom and the Guests, sit down at a Table
ready furnish'd with all sorts of Meat; but the Wo∣men
carry the Bride up strait-ways to her Chamber,
where having pull'd off her Cloaths, she is put to
Bed immediately. This done, the Bridegroom is
call'd away from the Table, and conducted by six
or eight young Lads with Torches (which they
stick into the Barrels of Wheat or Barley) into
the Chamber. As soon as the Bride perceives the
Bridegroom to approach, she goes out of Bed, on∣ly
with her Night-Gown on, meets and receives
him with a very submissive Reverence, with a low
Inclination of the Head; in the mean while, that
the new Husband takes this Opportunity to gaze
at her, this being commonly the first time that he
sees her Face. Thus they sit down together, like
Man and Wife (for it is to be considered, they are
not much addicted to Compliment) and among
other Dishes, a roasted Fowl is served up, which
the Bridegroom pulls asunder, casting over his
Shoulders that Part which first comes off, whether
Leg or Wing, the rest they eat; and, all being
withdrawn (unless it be one old Female Servant,
that keeps Watch at the Chamber-door) to work
they go, without any further Preamble, while
their Kindred and Friends are busie in certain
Charms, which they believe to be of very great
Consequence, either for fortifying the Codpiece,
or at least in defending it from Witchcraft, which
they are sorely afraid of (especially People of Qua∣lity)
the Nuns here being accounted very dextrous
both in tying and unravelling the Codpiece Point▪
The old Female that stands Centry at the Door,
asks some time after, whether the Battle be won;
and as soon as the Bridegroom answers, that it is,
she gives the Signal to the Trumpets, who make an
excellent Noi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, which continues, till the Stoves can
be got ready, where the new Married Couple bathe
<PB N="159" REF="87"/>
themselves, but apart. Here they are wash'd with
Water, Hydromel and Wine, and the Bride sends
the Bridegroom a fine Shirt, embroidered at the
Neck and Wrists, and a rich Habit. The two next
Days are spent in Entertainments, and all sorts of
Divertisements, but especially in Drinking, where
the Ladies sometimes improve the Opportunity of
their Husbands being drunk, to carry on an In∣trigues
this being the only Convenient time to
make their Advantage of, inspite of all the Rigour
of their jealous Husbands.</P>
<P>Those of less Quality are Married with less Ce∣remony.
The Night before the Wedding, the
young Man sends to his intended Bride some
Cloaths, a Cabinet with some Jewels, a Comb,
and a Looking-Glass. The next Day the Priest is
sent for, who comes with a Silver Cross, and have∣ing
given his Benediction to the whole Company,
the young Couple are set at the Table with a piece
of Taffeta between them; but whilst the <HI>Suacha</HI>
dresses the Brides Head, a Looking-Glass is brought,
and the young Couple joining their Cheeks, look,
and smile upon one another in the Glass; in the mean
while, Hops are cast upon them, and so they are
led to Church, where the Ceremonies are the same
as we have mentioned before. The Bridegroom is led
home by young Lads, and the Bride by some grave
Mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons and the <HI>Suacha,</HI> the Priest leading the Van
with his Cross; at home they are received by a
Quire of Boys and Girls, singing <HI>Epithalamiums</HI> or
Nuptial Songs, but of the coarsest sort of Bawdry;
and being afterwards conducted to their Nuptial
Bed, the <HI>Suacha</HI> is very careful in exhorting the
Bride to be <HI>Debonair</HI> and <HI>Buxom,</HI> and the Bride∣groom
not to deceive the Bride in her Expectati∣on;
In the Interim, she stands at the Chamber-Door,
in expectation when the business is over;
which being done, she carries the Tokens of Vir∣ginity,
with a great deal of Joy to her Parents, and
the next day or two are spent in Feasting and other
Jollities, which the Bridegroom endeavours to re∣cover
<PB N="160" REF="88"/>
his lost Spirits out of the <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> Cup, and
the Bride appears very chearful among her new
Friends, this being commonly the last Day of
Mirth for the poor Woman, unless what happy
Minutes she can get by Stealth, at her Husband's
drunken Hours. To speak without Partiality,
<HI>Muscovy</HI> may well be called the Purgatory of the
Women, they being kept under so rigorous a Dis∣cipline
by their Husbands, that in some Places
Slaves be treated with much less Severity:
For, it is not sufficient, that by their Ecclesiastical
Constitutions they are debarr'd from Venery two
Days in a Week, <HI>viz. Mondays</HI> and <HI>Wednesdays,</HI>
besides, in Lent, and some other Fastings, which
make up near Eight Months in the Year; but Ab∣stinency
from their Wives and <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> is the
chief Penance laid upon the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Husbands by
their Priests; so that the Wife bearing the same Share
with her Husband for his Trespasses, labours under
such Hardships as would seem intolerable in other
Countries. If a married Woman happens to grant
a Friend in a Corner Kindness, she is sure, besides the
House-Discipline, to be sent into a Monastery,
where she is to stay all her Life-time. The worst
of it is, that this Severity often furnishes a Husband,
with a Pretence upon the least Surmise, to rid
himself of his Wife, by suborning of Witnesses,
a thing frequently practis'd in those Parts. If a
married Woman happen to have no Children by
her Husband, he has the Liberty of Perswading,
and if that be not prevailing enough, of Cudgel∣ling
her into a Monastery, where she must tarry all
her Life-time, for what, perhaps, was none of her
Fault, but the Husbands, who has the Liberty of
m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrying again in six Weeks. But this is not all,
if the Husband is taken with a Fit of Devotion
(whether real or pretended, it matters not) of
leaving his Wife for God's sake, as they term it,
which is as much in plain <HI>English,</HI> when a Man is
tir'd of his Wife, and maintaining his Family, he
has the Liberty, of going into a Monastery,
<PB N="161" REF="88"/>
without his Wifes Consent, or making any Provi∣sion
for his Children; where he has a prospect of be∣coming,
perhaps, from a Mechanick, a Priest, if
his Wife marry again; this being the only Amends
the Wife has to make her self, if that may be ac∣counted
an Amends, when they are forced to
leap (according to the old Proverb) <HI>Out of the Fry∣ing-pan
into the Fire;</HI> for whenever they Marry a∣gain,
they are sure to meet with the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
House-Discipline, which is the Cudgel and the
Whip. It is so general a Custom in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> for a
Husband to chastise his Wife with the Whip, that
the Outcry's of a Woman upon such an Occasion,
are no more regarded, than we do a Correction
given to Children. They often used to tye them
up, stark naked, by the Hair of the Head, and so
to whip them as long as they were able; Nay, there
have not been wanting Examples of Husband's
whipping their Wives to Death, upon Suspicion of
Adultery, without as much as being call'd to an
Account for it, they pretending to be exempt from
Punishment on the account of killing a Wife or
Slave, if it happen upon Correction. This barba∣rous
Custom has of late Years, however, been
much alter'd, if not quite abolished, among Peo∣ple
of Fashion, by the prudent Care of the Pa∣rents,
who now a-days, to mitigate at least the
Slavery of their Daughters, oblige their Husbands
in their Jointures, under considerable Forfeitures,
to find them with Cloaths, suitable to their Quali∣ties,
to feed them with good wholesom Meat, and
Drink, to use them kindly without Whipping,
Striking or Kicking; but these Contracts, as all
others, are sometimes kept, sometimes broken, the
General Custom being a strong Plea on the Hus∣band's
side; the best Comfort the poor Women have,
is that their Neighbours and Friends receive the same
Treatment. I know it has been alledged in be∣half
of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> House-Discipline, that the
Women here have very lewd Tongues, will drink
a merry Cup of strong Liquor, and upon an Occa∣sion
<PB N="162" REF="89"/>
not refuse a Kindness to a Friend; but grant
this to be true, if the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> according to the
laudable Examples of other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI>
would give their Children of both Sexes a more
generous Education, the Husbands would shew
better Example and more Complaisance to their
Wives; these Means would prove, without all
question, more effectual than all their Whips and
Cudgels.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Oeconomy and the Af∣fairs
of their Houses in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Oe∣conomy.</NOTE> it must be con∣fessed,
that it bears not the least comparison with
what is usual in these Parts; for the inferior Sort
live in wooden Houses, very low, and meanly
built, their Houshold Stuff consisting commonly
in two or three Pots, and a few wooden or earthen
Dishes. Some of the richer Sort make use of
Pewter, but what they have of it is very ill kept,
as is most of their other Furniture, the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
not making the least account of Cleanliness▪
and as for Plate, there is scarce any thing like it to
be seen, unless it be some few drinking Cups and
Goblets. Their Rooms, at the best are hung with
Mats, and adorned with two or three Images, paint∣ed
after the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Fashion. As for their
Sleeping, they strive not only to imitate, but also
to out-do the antient Inhabitants of <HI>Capua;</HI> for
those would not allow their Children any Beds;
till they were Married, alledging, that Beds were in∣vented
for the Ease of Antient and decripid People,
not to encourage young Men in their Effoeminacy.
The <HI>Muscovites</HI> seem to be more severe, the most
of them not using Beds, neither before nor after
Marriage, nor in their Old Age. A great many
even of the better Sort are contented with Mat∣rushes,
and the Poor with Chaff or Straw, and for
want of that, with their Cloaths, which in the
Summer they spread upon a Table, Bench, or
perhaps the Ground; and in the Winter, lie near
or upon their Stoves, which are flat on the Top;
Master and Mistress, Man and Maid, all in one
<PB N="163" REF="89"/>
Room; nay, in the Country the Poultry and the
Pigs are not excluded from the same Room in the
Night-time. The common People have very little
other Chear but coarse Meal, Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Turnips, Cab∣bages,
Colworts, Cucumers, both f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh and pickl'd
with Salt and Vinegar. They seldom want fresh
Fish in a Country so abounding with Rivers and
Lakes; but their greatest Delicacy is Salt-fish, which
being ill salted, has a very strong Smell. Most of
their Dishes are season'd with Onions and Garlick▪
and that to such a degree, that you may know the
Approach of any of them by the Scent, before you
see them, especially in Lent. The Spawn of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh,
but especially of the Sturgeon, which we call <HI>Ca∣viare,</HI>
is one of their best Banquets. I have made
mention of this before in the IV. Chapter; but be∣cause
it is much esteem'd by a great many in these
Parts, but especially in <HI>Italy,</HI> where they use it in
Lent, I will give a short Description of it
here.</P>
<P><HI>Caviare,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caviare.</NOTE> or <HI>Cavajar</HI> (by the <HI>Russians</HI> called <HI>Ikary)</HI>
is made of the Roes of two different Fishes, which
they catch in the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> but espcecially near
the City of <HI>Astracan,</HI> to wit, of the Sturgeon,
and the <HI>Belluga.</HI> I will not pretend to describe the
first, it being too well known in these Parts; But
the <HI>Belluga</HI> is a large Fish, about twelve or fifteen
Foot long, without Sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, not unlike a Sturgeon,
but more large and incomparably more luscious,
his Belly being as tender as Marrow, and his Flesh
whiter than Veal, from whence he is call'd <HI>White∣fish</HI>
by the <HI>Europeans;</HI> under which Name we have
mention'd it before, in the Description of the Ri∣ver
<HI>Wolga</HI> and the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spian Sea.</HI> This <HI>Belluga</HI> lies in
the bottom of the River, at certain Seasons, and
swallows many large Pebbles of a great Weight, to
ballast himself against the Force of the Stream of
the <HI>Wolga</HI> augmented by the melting of the Snows
in the Spring: When the Wace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are asswaged, he
disgorges himself. Near <HI>Astrac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> they catch
sometimes such a Quantity of them, that they
<PB N="164" REF="90"/>
throw away the Flesh, (tho' the daintiest of all
Fish) reserving only the Spawn, of which they
sometimes take an Hundred and fifty, or Two
hundred Weight out of one Fish. These Roes
they salt and press, and put up into Casks, if it is
to be sent abroad, or to be kept for a considerable
time, else they keep it unpress'd, only a little
corn'd with Salt. That made of the Sturgeons
Spawn is black and small grain'd, somewhat Waxy,
like <HI>Potargo,</HI> and is called <HI>Ikary,</HI> by the <HI>Muscovites;</HI>
this is also made by the <HI>Turks.</HI> The second Sort
which is made of the Roes of the <HI>Belluga</HI> or <HI>White∣fish,</HI>
has a Grain as large as a small Pepper-corn, of
a darkish Grey, the <HI>Caviare</HI> made out of this
Spawn, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> call <HI>Arminska Ikary,</HI> because
they believe it was first made by the <HI>Armenians.</HI>
Both Kinds they cleanse from its Strings, salt it,
and lay it upon shelving Boards, to drein away the
Oily and most Unctuous Part; this being done,
they salt, press it, and put it up into Casks con∣taining
700 or 800 Weight, and so send it to <HI>Mus∣co</HI>
and other Places, from thence it is transported
by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> into <HI>Italy.</HI> That Glew
which is called Ising-glass is made out of the
<HI>Belluga</HI>'s Sounds.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Russian</HI> Diet; They prepare
this with Onions and Pepper mix'd with Oil
and Vinegar, in the Nature of a Salad. The
middling Sort of People in <HI>Muscovy</HI> living sparing∣ly,
and the Poor meanly in their Diet; they know
no Superfluity but Drink, which they will pur∣chase,
let come of it what will.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Drink is a sort of small <HI>Hydromel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quas.</NOTE>
which they call <HI>Quas;</HI> This they make of Honey-combs,
which they beat in warm Water, stirring it
about for some time, and after it hath rested ten
or twelve Hours, it is cleansed thorow a Sieve, boil'd
and scumm'd, and so immediately used.</P>
<P>Next to this is the strong <HI>Hydromel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hydro∣mel.</NOTE> which they
order sometimes with Rasberries, Cherries, Straw∣berries,
or Mulberries; they infuse what Fruit they
<PB N="165" REF="90"/>
have most a mind to, for two or three Nights, in
Water, or sometimes in <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> till it has ex∣tracted
the Colour and Tastes of the Fruit. Into
this they put the purest Honey, to every Pound
three or four Pounds of Water, according as they
would have it strong; Into this they put a Toast
dipp'd in the Dregs of Beer, which, as soon as
the <HI>Hydromel</HI> begins to work, they take out again.
When it has done working, they either keep it up∣on
or without the Lees, according as they either
intend to keep it or to spend it immediately; And
to give it a pleasant Flavour, they put into it some∣times
a little bag of Cinnamon and Grains of Para∣dise,
with a few Cloves. But their main Liquor is
<HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> made out of Corn, which tho' very
strong here, however they sometimes fortifie
with Pepper. Of this they drink a Dram before
and after Dinner, and at any other time when they
intend to make themselves merry.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality, and rich Merchants, have of
late Years built themselves Houses of Brick and
Stone; they lie upon Beds or Quilts, have Tapestry
and other Hangings, and the rest of their Houshold-stuff
is suitable to their Quality, yet not to that
Degree of Politeness as is usual in these Parts. As
for their Diet, they don't only use all sorts of Meats
and Fowls, but especially by reason of their fre∣quent
Fasts, have great Variety of Dishes of all
sorts of Fish, Herbs, and Pulse. Among the rest
they have one Dish, which they make use of after
a drunken Bout, and has a very savoury Taste. They
take cold roasted Veal, which they mince, but not
very small, with some pickl'd Cucumers, to this
they put good store of Vinegar, Pepper, and
the Liquor of pickl'd Cucumers, and recom∣mend
it as a good Preservative against the
Head-ach arising from hard Drinking; forasmuch as
they believe it dispells the Vapours rising into the
Head out of the Stomach. The Cellars of Per∣sons
of Quality are always well furnish'd with <HI>Hy∣dromel</HI>
or <HI>Mead, Aqua vitae,</HI> strong Beer, Sack, and
<PB N="166" REF="91"/>
other sorts of strong Wines; (for the <HI>Rhinish</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> Wines are in no great esteem among them,
as being not strong enough.) They brew their
strong Beer, as we do, in <HI>March,</HI> and to keep it
cool, (their Cellars not being vaulted) during the
Heat of the Summer they make a Bed of Ice and
Snow mix'd tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, and then a Layer of Bar∣rels,
upon them another Bed of Ice, and then a∣gain
a Row of Barrels, which they cover with
Straw and Planks, which serves for a Vault. They
are very Splendid in their Cloaths and Equipage,
being attended by a great Number of Slaves, all
which however they do without any great Expence,
for asmuch as what Provisions they want for them∣selves
and their Horses, is brought from their Farms
in the Country; and as for those Slaves they enter∣tain
in the City, they allow them Board-Wages,
but so scantily that they can scarce live upon it.
This is one of the chiefest Causes that so many
Riots and Murthers are committed in the Streets of
the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and, that in Hay-making time
the Roads leading to this City are so unsafe to tra∣vel,
there being about that time so great a Number
of Slaves abroad working in the Fields. Persons
of Quality and the richest Merchants in <HI>Musco</HI>
keep for this Reason a Guard in their Courts, who
watch all Night, and are to knock every hour with
a Stick upon a Board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Interr∣ments.</NOTE> as many Knocks at a time
as the Clock has struck Hours.</P>
<P>They are very Ceremonious in their Interrments.
No sooner is the sick Person departed, but all the
Kindred and Friends come and stand about the
Body, making most horrid Out-cries▪ and Lamen∣tations.
They ask him, <HI>Why he would dye? Whe∣ther
he wanted Meat and Drink? Whether he had
not a Handsom Wife?</HI> and such like Questions.
The next thing to be taken care of, is to send a
Present to the Priest to pray for the Soul of the de∣ceased
Party, which he is to do Morning and E∣vening,
for six Weeks, upon his Grave. For
tho' the <HI>Muscovites</HI> do not believe Purgatory
<PB N="167" REF="91"/>
yet they believe two different Places, where the
Soul retires till the Day of Judgment; some,
they say, abide in a pleasant Place, where they
enjoy the Conversation of Angels; others in a dark
Valley, where they are pester'd with the Company
of Devils. They are of Opinion, that by the
Prayers of Priests and Monks, the Souls may be
delivered out of this Place of Misery, and God's
Wrath be appeased against the Day of Judgment.
For which reason also, those that are able give fre∣quent
Alms, during these six Weeks. Before it be
put into the Coffin, which is made out of the
Trunk of a Tree, the Body is well wash'd, the
Shrowd, or a clean Shirt put about it, and a pair
of new Shooes on the Feet, with the Arms cross
the Breast.</P>
<P>At the Funeral Solemnity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funeral Ceremo∣nies.</NOTE> the Priest goes first,
carrying the Image of that Saint, which had been
assigned the Deceased at his Baptism for his Pa∣tron.
Him follow four Virgins, the next of Kin
to the deceased, who represent the Mourners, and
make most horrid Out-cries and Lamentations, all
in a Tune, not unlike the wild <HI>Irish.</HI> Then fol∣lows
the Body, carried by six Men upon their
Shoulders, the Kindred and Friends following the
Body without any Order, with Wax-Candles in
their Hands, whilst the Priest is singing certain
<HI>Psalms,</HI> they surround the Body, and by their In∣censes,
keep off the evil Spirits.</P>
<P>Being come to the Grave, the Coffin is uncover∣ed,
and the same Saint that was carried before the
Procession, is held over him; the Priest in the
mean while saying certain Prayers, and repeating
frequently these Words: <HI>Lord, look upon this Soul
in Righteousness;</HI> and the Widow continuing (but
how heartily, is easie to be guess'd, considering
their Usage) her former Lamentations: <HI>Timming
Dooshink. Alas! My Dear, Why wouldst thou leave
me thus?</HI> And repeating the same questions we
have mentioned before. Then the Kindred and
Friends take their last Farewel of the Deceased,
<PB N="168" REF="92"/>
some kissing him, some the Coffin; and as soon as
the Priest has put a Testimonial between his Fin∣gers,
which is to serve him as a Pass for the other
World, the Coffin is shut up, and put into the
Grave, with the Face towards the East. The Kin∣dred,
after having paid their Devotions to the Ima∣ges,
return to the House, where they drown their
Sorrow in strong Liquor. The Mourning is con∣tinued
for forty Days after, during which, the
Kindred are entertained at three several times, <HI>viz.</HI>
the third, the ninth, and twentieth Day; and
during this time of Mourning, the Priest reads twice
a day (as we mentioned before) the <HI>Psalms</HI> upon
the Grave, having a little Booth made up of Mats,
to shelter him from the Weather. The Testimo∣nial
or Pass for his Admittance into the other World
is signed by the Patriarch or Metropolitan of the
Place, and the Confessor, who sells it according to
the Ability of those that are to buy it. This Te∣stimonial
runs thus: <HI>We, whose Names are hereunto
subscribed, the Patriarch (or Metropolitan) and Priest
of the City of</HI> N. <HI>do Certifie by these Presents, That
the Bearer hereof hath always beha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed himself and lived
among us as became a good Christian, professing the
Greek Religion; and tho he may have committed some
Sins, he hath Confessed the same, whereupon he hath
received Absolution, and taken the Communion for the
Remission of his Sins. That he hath honoured God and
his Saints; that he hath not neglected his Prayers, and
hath Fasted on the Hours and Days appointed by the
Church; and that he hath always behaved himself to∣wards
me, who am his Confessor, in such a
manner, that I have no Reason to complain of him,
nor to deny him the Absolution of his Sins. In witness
whereof, we have given him these Testimonials, to the
end, That St.</HI> Peter, <HI>upon sight of them, may not de∣ny
him the opening of the Gate of Eternal Bliss.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Civil Government, Laws, and Justi∣ciary
Proceedings of the Muscovites.</HEAD>
<P>THE State of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> or its Political Govern∣ment,
of which we are to treat in this Chap∣ter,
is not only Monarchical, but also Despotical or
Absolute; forasmuch as the Czar being sole and
absolute Master over all his Subjects, disposes with∣out
Controul of their Lives and Estates, in the same
manner as in most antient Times did the Kings of
<HI>Assyria, Media</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> who governed their
Subjects no otherwise, than a Lord does his Slaves;
and as it is to this day in <HI>Turky,</HI> where the
<HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> disposes of the Lives and Fortunes
of his Subjects at pleasure. The Czars of <HI>Muscovy</HI>
possessed with so uncontrouled a Power, as Here∣ditary
Sovereigns of these vast Countreys we have
given a short Description of in the foregoing Chap∣ters,
that there is not a <HI>Knez</HI> or Lord so great in all
these vast Dominions, but who without Reluctan∣cy
confesses, that he is his Czarish Majesty's <HI>Galop</HI>
or Slave. It is therefore the Czar alone, that gives
Laws to the People; it is he that disposeth of the
Government of Provinces; it is he that Levies
Taxes, makes Peace and War; and to be short, does
what he pleases. For, tho' he consults in Matters of
Importance with his <HI>Boyars</HI> or Councellors; yet, be∣sides,
that this Counsel is of his own Chusing; he
does not always follow it, but reserves to himself
the Prerogative of doing what he judges most con∣venient.
The Honours of <HI>Knez, Boyars, Dukes</HI> or
<HI>Princes</HI> owe all their Origin to the Czar's Favour,
which they bestow upon such as they would Re∣ward
for their Services; and the greatest of them
<PB N="170" REF="93"/>
depend upon the Czar's meer Pleasure, and own pub∣lickly,
that all they have belongs to God and Them:
Nay, formerly (within our Age) they were whipt
like the vilest Slaves, and that sometimes for a small
matter, but of late years small miscarriages have
been punished with two or three days Imprisonment.
This Slavish Subjection seems to be natural to the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> forasmuch as in all these several Revolu∣tions
that have happened there in our Age, they
have frequently changed their Masters, but never
shew'd the least inclination of changing the Form of
their Government, which the Sovereign Power has
devolved into their hands. The wiser sort among
them were perhaps sensible, that those who are
good Slaves, make the worst Freemen in the World;
not only their natural Inclination, but also their
Education, having infused into them the Princi∣ples
of <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> in so transcendent a De∣gree,
as not to have the true Sense of that Liber∣ty
we enjoy in these Parts. This is sufficiently evi∣dent
out of their whole Behaviour, both in pu∣blick
and private; None among them, of what
Quality soever approaches the Czar with a Petiti∣on
or otherwise, but he names himself in the Di∣minutive.
As for instance, if his Name be <HI>Peter,</HI>
he will say, <HI>I little Peter,</HI> do implore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When
they are to be admitted into his Presence, they
say; <HI>Shall I have the Honour to see the brightness of
the Eyes of His Czarish Majesty?</HI> If you ask them
a Question that surpasses their Judgment, they will
answer; <HI>God and the Czar knows;</HI> and nothing is
more frequent in their common Discourse, than to
own, that, <HI>all what they have is at God's and the
Czar's Disposal.</HI> The Great Duke, <HI>John Basilowits,</HI>
was the first that reduced them to this entire Sub∣mission;
for, when most of these Territories, now
under the Subjection of the Grand Czar of <HI>Musco∣vy,</HI>
were divided into a great many Principalities,
Govern'd by their own Laws and Princes, there is
no question, but that the Nobility had their Share
in the Government here, as well as they had in
<PB N="171" REF="93"/>
former Ages in most Countreys of <HI>Europe;</HI> and
what confirms me the more in this Opinion, is,
that at the Solemnity of the Czar's Coronation,
among other Things the <HI>Estates, Ecclesiastical and
Temporal,</HI> are mentioned by the Patriarch, as we
shall see anon. This entire Resignation and Sub∣jection
of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to the Absolute Disposal
of their Sovereign, has ever since been maintain'd
by three general Maxims; The first is, that no bo∣dy
is allow'd, upon pain of Death, to travel out
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> without leave of his Czarish Majesty;
The second is, that the Czar never Marries a foreign
Princess, but looks out for a Spouse among his
own Subjects. The third is, the Discouragement
of Learning and Sciences, their Knowledge, even
of the Priests themselves, not reaching beyond
Reading and Writing their own Language. The
reason of it is obvious; for asmuch as Igno∣rance
makes people supple, and conduces much to
the easie Conservation of what by a long Custom
and Education has been implanted in them; where∣as
Knowledge is merely without Ambition. <HI>Ly∣curgus</HI>
was not ignorant of this Maxim, when he
establish'd Ignorance as one of the fundamental
Laws of his Republick; And the Emperours, <HI>Va∣lentinian</HI>
and <HI>Licinius,</HI> used to term Learning the
Plague and Poyson of Sovereignty. And, that
by Travelling abroad they might not be enamour'd
with the sweet taste of Liberty, other Nations en∣joy▪
and perhaps, by their Conversation, be in∣structed
in such Matters, as were not to be learn'd
at home; they were not only prohibited to go a∣broad
into other Countreys, but also Persons of a
high Rank debarr'd from Conversing with foreign
Ministers in their own Country, without the Great
Duke's express Permission. And for fear, that by
introducing a foreign Princess, some new Customs
might be introduced among the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> which
in time might cause an Alteration in the State, the
Czars of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> (quite contrary to what is pra∣ctised
by other Princes in <HI>Europe)</HI> always chuse their
<PB N="172" REF="94"/>
Spouses among their own Subjects. The Czar be∣ing
thus secure of his Subject's entire Obedience,
he alone creates and deposes Magistrates, and or∣ders
them to be punished at Pleasure. He ap∣points
the Governours and Lieutenants of Provinces,
for the Management of the antient Demesnes, and
the Administration of Justice; they have a <HI>Diack</HI>
or Secretary, and sometimes another Assessor join'd
with them, and take Cognisance of all Matters,
giving a final and absolute Judgment in all Causes,
and have full Power to see their Sentences put in
Execution, without any Appeal; unless the Cause
be removed before Judgment given, to one of the
<HI>Pricas</HI> or Courts of Justice in <HI>Musco.</HI> They are
changed from three years to three years.</P>
<P>Besides these Courts, kept by the <HI>Waywode</HI> or
Governour in the Provinces, there are a great
many others, who are all kept in the City of <HI>Mus∣co,</HI>
and are call'd <HI>Pricas,</HI> where always one of the
<HI>Boyars,</HI> or the Czar's Ministers is President, having
join'd with him, sometimes one, sometimes more
Assessors, and a <HI>Diack</HI> or Secretary.</P>
<P>The chiefest are <HI>Pomiestnoi Pricas,</HI> where a Re∣gister
is kept of all Manors held by homage, and
the Sutes concerning them are adjudged, and the
Duties belonging to the Great Duke received.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Casanskoi,</HI> and <HI>Siberskoy Pricas;</HI> all differ∣ences
of the Provinces of <HI>Casan</HI> and <HI>Siberia,</HI> are
determined, and Accompts kept of all the Furs
coming from thence to the Great Duke.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Rosboinoy Pricas,</HI> all Robberies upon the
High-way, Murthers, and other Criminal Causes
are Judged.</P>
<P>The Provinces of <HI>Gallitz</HI> and <HI>Wolodimer,</HI> have
also their particular <HI>Pricas,</HI> which is called <HI>Gallias∣ko-Volodimirski
Pricas;</HI> as <HI>Novorodkoi Pricas</HI> belongs
to <HI>Novogorod,</HI> and <HI>Nise-novogorod.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knez</HI> and <HI>Boyars</HI> have their own <HI>Pricas,</HI>
as have also the Gentlemen and Officers of the
Court. The <HI>Diacks,</HI> Secretaries, Clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have
their own Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="94"/>
In the <HI>Monasterski Pricas,</HI> all Ecclesiastical Per∣sons,
whether Secular Priests or Monks are judged,
except it be in priviledged Cases. Besides which,
the Patriarch has his particular <HI>Pricas.</HI></P>
<P>There are a great many other <HI>Pricas,</HI> or Courts of
Justice, as those for the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Factors, for his Re∣venues,
for the <HI>Galops</HI> or Slaves, for the Retalers of
Wine, <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> and Hydromel or Mead, for his
Smiths, Armourers, Cannoneers; For the Milita∣ry
Officers, for the Cavalry, and many more, too
many to be described here.</P>
<P>Besides which, there is one general <HI>Pricas</HI> or
Court of Justice, where all Matters that do not
appertain to any peculiar <HI>Pricas,</HI> are determined,
this is called <HI>Siskoi Pricas.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Diacks</HI> or Secretaries, Clerks, and Copiers
of these Courts, are very well Skill'd in Writing
and Arithmetick, the latter of which they perform
by the help of Plumb-Stones instead of Compters.
They keep their Registers in Rolls of Paper pasted
together, which being 30 or 40 Yards long, are
kept in the Offices. The <HI>Boyar,</HI> who is President
of each Court, and has his Secretary and Assessors,
determines finally, all such Causes as come under
his Cognisance, he being the Representative of his
Imperial Majesty.</P>
<P>Formerly most of these Causes depended from
the Equity of the Judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></NOTE> there being very few
Laws established then, according to which, Judg∣ment
was to be given; They only were concerning
High Treason, Adulteries, Thefts, and Debts be∣tween
private Persons. But in the Year 1647, a
Book was compiled in <HI>Folio,</HI> under the Title of <HI>So∣borna
Ʋlosienia,</HI> that is to say, Universal and Gene∣ral
Right, containing all the several Laws and Or∣dinances,
according to which, the Judges were to
regulate themselves in the Courts of Judicature.
In Civil Cases, they proceed thus: If there be no
sufficient Evidence on the Plaintiff's side as to the
Matter of Fact alledged against the Defendant, the
latter is ask'd, Whether he will by his Oath, con∣firm
<PB N="174" REF="95"/>
the Answer given to the Plaintiff's Declara∣tion,
or else refer it to the Plaintiff's Oath. He,
who consents to take the Oath, is brought in the
presence of one of their Saints, where being ad∣monished,
and ask'd, Whether he will take this
Oath upon the Salvation of his Soul? If he per∣sists
in his Resolution, he is obliged to kiss a little
Cross, and the Saint's Image. Those that have
taken an Oath, tho' never so true, are look'd upon
as Scandalous, and are not admitted to the Com∣munion
in three Years after. For which Reason,
and to obviate Perjuries (which are pretty com∣mon
here) the Great Duke made an Edict in the
Year 1634, That all Promises or Obligations, whe∣ther
for Money or Pawning, tho' between Father
and Son, should be put in Writing, sign'd by both
Parties, under Forfeiture of the Debt. Perjury
is punished by a severe Whipping and Banishment.
Strangers take their Oaths according to the Cu∣stom
of their several Countreys and Religions.</P>
<P>In Criminal Cases, the Accused cannot be Con∣demn'd,
altho'never so many Witnesses appear against
him, unless he confess the Fact. To force therefore
Criminals to a Confession of the truth, they make use
of the Torture, which has its several Degrees:
The first is the <HI>Strapado;</HI> when they hang the
Malefactor with his Hands tyed behind, in the
Air, having fastned to his Feet a great Beam, upon
which the Executioner ever and anon gets up, to
further the Dislocation of the Members, and conse∣quently
to augment the Pain. Under his Feet is
made a Fire, which with the Smoak and Heat stifles
and burns him: If they don't think this sufficient,
they shave his Head, and, as he is thus hanging,
drop gradually cold Water upon the Crown of his
Head, which is the most exquisite Torment that
can be invented. Whipping in <HI>Muscovy</HI> is per∣form'd
thus; A lusty Fellow, one of the Executi∣oner's
Men after having stript them to the middle,
takes up one by one upon his Back (much after
the same manner as the Boys in <HI>England</HI> are hors'd
<PB N="175" REF="95"/>
by their Fellow-Scholars at School) and having ty'd
their Feet together with a Cord which comes thro'
the Legs of him that holds them up, is held by
another Servant of the Executioners, so fast that
they are not able to stir. The Executioner with
a Bulls Pizzle, having fastned to the end of it three
Straps of an Elks Skin not tann'd, lays it on their
Back with so much Dexterity and Strength, that at
every Lash the Blood gushes out on all sides:
Heretofore these Punishments were not accounted
Infamous, and were inflicted upon Persons of the
first Rank; but time has in a great measure cor∣rected
that Error. Besides this, they have another
Way of Chastisement, which is also used in Fami∣lies
for the Correction of Children and Slaves. He
that is to be thus corrected, after having pull'd off
his Cloaths to the Shirt and Drawers, is laid down
upon the Ground flat upon his Belly, one sits a∣cross
his Head and Neck, another upon his Feet,
each of them furnish'd with a good Switch, where∣with
they soundly tickle his Back, in the same
Manner as we beat the Dust out of Cloaths or
Hangings. Murther is a capital Crime, unless no
body prosecute it; or it be that a Man kills his
Wife or Slave under Correction. He that has com∣mitted
a Murther, after he has been kept with
Bread and Water in close Prison, has his Head cut
off; But if a Wife kills her Husband, she is put
in the Ground, alive, up to the Neck, till she dies.
The Punishment of Coiners is, to have some
Metal ready melted pour'd down their Throats.
Traitors, after they have been tormented to the
highest Degree, are often banish'd into <HI>Siberia,</HI>
some with their Noses and Ears cropp'd, some
without Eyes, some are put under the Ice. Hang∣ing
has not been long in use in <HI>Russia;</HI> but
what is most remarkable is, that the Malefactor,
most commonly at the Command of the Hangm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,
puts his Neck thorow the Noose, and turns him∣self
off, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch particular Admirers are the <HI>Russians</HI>
of Passive Obedience. Thefts are not capital in
<PB N="176" REF="96"/>
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> but they are not sparing in applying to
them the Torture for the Discovery of their Ac∣complices.
The first time, after a sound Whipping
across the Market-place, they have one Ear cut off,
and are imprison'd for two Years; The second
time they receive the same Punishment; but as an
additional Chastisement, are banish'd into <HI>Siberia.</HI>
The Concealers and Receivers undergo the same
Punishment. Those that sell Tobacco and <HI>Aqua
vitae</HI> without Licence, have their Nostrils slit, or
else are whipt. How they punish Adultery is
mentioned before. Those that are uncapable of
paying their Debts, are us'd with a most barbarous
Severity: For if any one happen to fail of paying
at the time prefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, he is put in a Sergeant's
House for some time, to see whether in the mean
time he can make Satisfaction or agree with the
Creditor. If he cannot, he is carried to Prison,
and from thence brought every Day to a certain
Place appointed for that purpose, where, for a
whole Hour, the Executioner beats him with a
pretty thick Wand across the Shin-bone. If he
can put in Security for his forth-coming the next
day, in order to receive the same Chastisement, he
is permited to go home; if not, he is remanded
to Prison, and is to undergo the same every day
till he has made Satisfaction; which if he cannot
do at last, he is to be sold as a Slave to his Credi∣tor,
with Wife and Children; but this last the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
are not much concern'd at, forasmuch as
they frequently fell themselves and their whole
Family upon a very slender Account. So much are
they accustom'd to Slavery, that they scarce look
upon it as a Punishment. Sometimes the Execu∣tioner,
for a Present, will suffer the Debtor to put
a small Iron Plate under his Boots. The same
Rigour is used, without any difference, to all of
what Quality, Condition, Sex or Age soever.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An account of the Coronation of the Czars
of Muscovy, their Grandeur, Revenue,
Marriages, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NO sooner is the Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI> dead, but Mes∣sengers
are sent every where to summon the
Chief Officers of the Court and others, who are
to be present at the Coronation, to repair to the
City of <HI>Musco,</HI> where this Solemnity is perfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med
with all the Expedition imaginable, and sometimes
the very next day after the Decease of the Prede∣cessor.
The Metropolitans, Archbishops, Knez, Boy∣ars,
and the principal Merchants of the Kingdom,
being entred the place at the day appointed for the
Coronation of the new Czar, a Scaffold is erected
three Steps high, and covered with <HI>Persian</HI> Tape∣stry,
in the great Church within the Castle. On
this Scaffold are set three very rich Chairs, at an e∣qual
distance from one another, to wit: One for
the Great Duke, another for the Patriarch, and
the third for the Ducal Cap, embroider'd with
Pearls and Diamonds, with a Tassel on the Crown
of it, on which hangs a little Crown, all over be∣set
with Diamonds of a great Value, and the Robe,
which is made of the richest Brocado, lined with
Sables.</P>
<P><HI>The new Czar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Czar's Coronation▪</NOTE> <HI>attended by the Patriarch and
Metropolitans, being come within the Church, the
Clergy begin to sing certain Hymns, which being
done, the Patriarch prays to God, St.</HI> Nicholas,
<HI>and other Saints, desiring them to be present at
this Great Solemnity. The prayer being ended, the
Chief Minister of State takes the Grand Duke by
the Hand, and presents him to the Patriarch, and
says:</HI> The <HI>Knez</HI> and <HI>Boyars</HI> having acknowledged this
<PB N="178" REF="98"/>
Prince the lawful Heir to the Crown, as being the next
of Kin to the late Czar, they desire, that you may
Crown him immediately. <HI>The Patriarch then leads
the Prince upon the Scaffold, where being seated in
one of the three Chairs, he blesses him with a lit∣tle
Cross beset with Diamonds, by putting it to his
Head, and immediately after, one of the Metro∣po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tans
reads the following Prayer:</HI> O Great Lord
our God, thou King of kings, who by the Prophet Sa∣muel,
didst once chuse thy faithful Servant, David, to
be King over thy People of Israel, hearken to our Pray∣ers,
which we thy unworthy Servants offer up unto thee,
at this time. Look down from the highest Heaven up∣on
thy faithful Servant here present, who, through thy
Grace, thou hast exalted to be King over thy People, and
thy Son hath redeemed by his Blood. Anoint him with
the Oil of Chearfulness, protect him by thy Power, and
Crown him with a precious Diadem; grant him a long
and happy Reign; put the Royal Scepter into his Hands,
that he may sway it upon the Throne of Justice. Let
all barbarous Languages acknowledge his Power, and
let both his Heart and Ʋnderstanding be always dire∣cted
to thy fear, and during the Course of this mortal
Life, let him never recede from thy Commandments.
Let Heresie, and Schism not come near his Person or
Government; and may he always maintain and observe
what is commanded and ordained by the holy <HI>Greek
Church;</HI> Judge thy People in Justice, and shew thy
Mercy to the Poor, that, when they leave this Valley of
Misery, they may be received into eternal Joys. <HI>The
whole Prayer he concludes with these Words;</HI> For
thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory: God
the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, be
with us and remain with us.</P>
<P>The Prayer ended, two Metropolitans by order
from the Patriarch, take the Cap and Robe up,
which are taken from their Hands by some <HI>Boyars,</HI>
who put them upon the Grand Duke, whom the
Patriarch blesses a second time by touching his Fore∣head
with the Cross of Diamonds; and whilst he
is saying, <HI>In the Name of the Father, the Son, and
<PB N="179" REF="98"/>
the Holy Ghost,</HI> and imparting the third Blessing to
the Grand Duke, the Ducal Cap is by two of the
<HI>Boyars,</HI> put upon the Patriarch's Head, who causes
all the rest of the Prelates there present, to ap∣proach,
and give the Benediction to the Great
Duke, but only with their Hands. Then the Great
Duke and Patriarch sit down, but raise again im∣mediately,
when the Litany is sung, every Verse
ending, with <HI>God have mercy upon us,</HI> and the new
Czar's Name. The Litany ended, both the Great Duke
and Patriarch sit down again, when one of the Me∣tropolitans,
approaching to the Alta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sings the fol∣lowing
Words: <HI>O God preserve our Czar, and Grand
Duke of all the</HI> Russes, <HI>whom God, out of his great Mercy
hath bestowed upon us, God grant him good Health,
and a long and happy Life.</HI> All that are present, re∣peat
the same Words, and the <HI>Boyars,</HI> and Chief
Lords approaching to the Great Duke, as a sign of
their Subjection, smite their Foreheads before him,
and afterwards kiss his Hand. This Ceremony be∣ing
over, the Patriarch standing alone before the
Great Duke, admonishes him in the following
Words: <HI>Since through the singular Providence of God,
the Estates of the Kingdom, as well Ecclesiastical as
Temporal, have Acknowledged and Crowned You Great
Duke over all the</HI> Russes, <HI>and have Entrusted You with
a Matter of so great Weight, as the Government of so
great a Kingdom, You ought to employ all Your Thoughts,
to the Love of God, to the Obedience of His Commands,
to the due Administration of Justice, and the Prote∣ction
of the True</HI> Greek <HI>Religion.</HI> Then the Patriarch
gives him once more his Bendiction, and the whole
Assembly goes from thence into the Church of St.
<HI>Michael</HI> the Archangel, which is opposite to the
former; where the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>any is Sung over again, as be∣fore;
the same is done afterwards in the Church of
St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where an End is put to the Ceremony,
and the whole Assembly is most magnificently En∣tertain'd
in the great Hall of the Great Duke's Pa∣lace.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="99"/>
In former times the Chiefest Dignity in the whole
Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Principal Offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of the Court.</NOTE> was that of Lord High Steward of <HI>Musco∣vy</HI>
(call'd <HI>Sunderstrevoi Coiniske.)</HI> When <HI>Zurki</HI> was
called to the Crown, he was in that Office; since
which time, it has been suppressed. The next, and
which is now the first in Dignity, is the <HI>Duaretskoy,</HI>
or Great Master, which is correspondent to our Lord
High Steward of the Houshold. The next in or∣der
is the <HI>Orusnitshei,</HI> or Master of the Horse. These
three precede all the other <HI>Boyars</HI> and Lords of the
Court. Next to these are the two Secretaries of 
State, the first whereof, is the Lord Keeper of
the Great Seal or Chancellour, the other is the Vice
Chancellour. After them come the <HI>Posticnizei</HI> or
Lord Chamberlain, who makes the Great Duke's
Bed; next to him the <HI>Catamutzoy Klut-ziom,</HI> or Vice
Chamberlain, the <HI>Cratzey</HI> or Carver. Then fol∣low
the <HI>Stolniki</HI> or Gentlemen Sewers, the <HI>Strapsi</HI> or
Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, and the <HI>Duo∣roini</HI>
or Gentlemen-Ushers; besides the Pages, Se∣cretaries
and Clerks, and a good number of Inter∣preters,
for all Languages. Besides these, there
are six Capital Officers belonging to the Court,
which they call Courts of Chancery: The first is
for foreign Affairs, under the Tuition of its Chan∣cellour;
the second for War, the third for Crown-Lands,
and the Czar's Revenues, under the Lord
Treasurer: The fourth receives the Accompts of
Factors, and those that manage the Taverns▪
The fifth is for Appeal in Civil Causes, and the sixth
for Criminal Causes. The Czar has also two Councils,
with whom he consults concerning Matters of Mo∣ment;
the first is in the nature of the Cabinet Coun∣cil,
composed of the <HI>Boyars;</HI> the second is corre∣sponding
to our Privy Council, composed out of the
<HI>Ocolnits,</HI> or Lords, out of whose number the <HI>Boy∣ars</HI>
are chosen, and all of them depending from
the meere Pleasure of the Czar; they commonly
meet in the Night-time, when they are to consult
about State Affairs. All the <HI>Knez</HI> and the <HI>Boyars,</HI>
who have plentiful Estates, are obliged to give
<PB N="181" REF="99"/>
their Attendance every day at Court, and to smite
their Forehead in the Great Duke's Presence, which
he looks upon as an Argument of their Fidelity and
his Security, which by their Absence might be put
in danger, considering the great Authority they
have in their respective Provinces. They are obli∣ged
to appear at Court in great Splendor, to live
very Magnificiently, both in their Houses and Re∣tinue;
so, that those who have no Employments,
and want Means to make their Appearance at Court,
have leave given them to retire into the Country,
where they live, rather like Peasants than Noble∣men.
The <HI>Knez, Boyars</HI> and Gentlemen, enjoy
this Prerogative as well as the Monasteries, that
they are exempted from Taxes, but are obliged to
maintain a certain number of Soldiers, both Horse
and Foot, proportionable to their Revenue. No
body is permitted, of what Quality soever, to ap∣pear
in the Czar's presence with a Sword on his side,
nay, not as much as within the Palace.</P>
<P>The Court of the Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI> never appears
in greater Splendor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> than at the publick Audiences
of Ambassadors; when all the <HI>Knez, Boyars,</HI> Of∣ficers
of the Houshold, and the Chiefest of the
Czar's Factors, are obliged to appear in the greatest
Magnificence in the World. Besides several Regi∣ments
of Guards, which are drawn up on both
sides of the Courts of the Palace, to the very bot∣tom
of the Stairs, where the Ambassador is to
pass. In the Hall which leads immediately to that
where the Audience is to be given, the Guards of
the Czar's Person are placed in a most splendid E∣quipage,
their Vests of Velvet, lin'd with Sables,
their Caps adorn'd with Pearls and precious Stones,
and their Partisans cover'd with Gold and Silver.
At the upper End of the Hall of Audience, His
Czarish Majesty is placed in a Throne of Massie
Silver, with his Scepter in his Hand, and a Crown
on his Head. The Throne is most curiously wrought,
standing seven or eight Steps higher than the
Floor. The Crown which the Czar upon such an
<PB N="182" REF="100"/>
Occasion wears upon a Cap lin'd with Sables, is co∣vered
all over with precious Stones, it terminates
towards the Top, in the Form of a Pyramid, with
a Golden Cross at the Spire. The Scepter glisters
all over with precious Stones of great Value; his
Garments being covered before with Jewels, and
embroider'd all over with Pearls. On both sides of
the Chair or Throne, but something Lower stand
four young Lords, remarkable for their Tallness,
with Silver Battle-Axes over their Shoulders, put∣ting
their Hands to them as if they were going to
strike. They are clad always in White, sometimes
in Satt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sometimes in Ermin Vests, according to the
difference of the Season; their Caps, nay, even their
B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots, being cover'd with the same, having great
Chains of Gold a-cross their Breasts, reaching down to
their Hips. On the right side of the Chair or Throne,
upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ramid of Silver stands the Imperial Apple,
of massie Gold, of a considerable Bigness, representing
the World; and on the same side, five Paces Distance
from the Throne, stands the Lord Chancellour.
Round about by the Walls are Benches rais'd three
or four steps above the Floor, and about the
b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadth of a good Walk, where are placed the
<HI>Knez</HI> and <HI>Boyars,</HI> sometimes to the Number of two
hundred, cloathed all of them with Vests of Cloth
of Gold and Silver, or Velvet adorn'd▪ with Pearls
and Jewels. The Grose or the Czar's Merchants or
Factors, stand at the lower End of the Hall, in
ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y rich R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bes, taken for that purpose out of the
Czar's Wardrobe; The Sides and Floor of the Hall
of Audience, as also the Benches, where the Lords
are plac'd, being all covered with rich <HI>Persian</HI>
Tapest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. As soon as an Ambassador enters the
Hall of Audience, he makes a very low Reverence,
the Throne of the Czar being exactly opposite to the
Door; Then advancing, and stopping in the midst
of the Hall, he makes a second, and when he is
ready to speak, the third. The Credentials being
delivered to the Czar, (who immediately gives
them to his Chancellour that stands near the Throne)
<PB N="183" REF="100"/>
and the Presents sent to the Czar being offered, and
the Salutes and other Ceremonies us'd upon such
Occasions past, the Ambassador is reconducted to
his Palace, where he is splendidly entertain'd with
a great number of Dishes out of the Czar's Kitchen,
which in great State are carried from the Castle to
the Ambassadors House. There is one thing very
remarkable in this Court in the Publick Audience
of Christian Ambassadors, that they and their Re∣tinue
are obliged to kiss the Grand Czar's Hand;
which, as it is otherwise look'd upon as a thing
much below the Dignity of an Ambassador; so it
is consider'd in the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Court as a particular
Favour, which is only granted to the Ambassadors
of Christian Princes, and never permitted to In∣fidels.</P>
<P>The Revenues of the Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI> are pro∣portionable
to the vast Extent of his Dominions.
For besides, that he is Heir to all who die intestate and
without Heirs; He lays what Imposition he thinks
convenient upon the Estates and Persons of his Sub∣jects,
which indeed, in times of Peace are not great;
but in times of War very excessive; so that they
pay sometimes the <HI>Pottina,</HI> as it is call'd in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
which is the Fifth Part of every Man's Estate; as in
the Reign of <HI>Michael Federowitz,</HI> when the famous
Siege of <HI>Smolensko</HI> was to be undertaken, in the
Year 1632. But most frequently at the Begin∣ning
of any great War, the Tenth is paid by the
<HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>The Great Duke's proper Demesne, is always farm'd
out, from whence arises so considerable a Revenue,
that it maintains near a Hundred Thousand <HI>Strelitz</HI>
or▪ Musketeers, which are in part employ'd for the
Guard of his Person and the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> partly
are dispos'd in the Frontier-places.</P>
<P>The Customs are very considerable in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> of all Merchandices imported or ex∣ported,
being to be paid to the Czar. The Cu∣stom-House
of <HI>Archangel</HI> has some Years paid in
near 200000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; and since the Establish∣ment
<PB N="184" REF="101"/>
of a free Commerce betwixt <HI>China, Persia</HI>
and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the Customs paid on those Frontiers
amount to a great Sum yearly.</P>
<P>The Czar is as it were the General Merchant of
the Empire, employing under him a great number
of Factors, who are all accountable to him. What
is imported by the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> is engrossed
for the Czar's Use at a certain Price; Hides, Pot∣ash,
Wax, Hemp, Flax, and other such like Com∣modities,
which are of the Product of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
are sent by these Factors to <HI>Archangel</HI> and other
places, where they are truck'd off for Silk, Cloth,
Velvet, Cloth of Gold, and such other Commo∣dities
as the Czar stands in need of; it being a Cu∣stom
in <HI>Muscovy</HI> for the Czar to bestow his Graces
among his Subjects, in Silks, Velvets, Sables, and
such like; As his Houshold-Servants are for the
most part paid with Meal, Honey, Fish, Nut-oils,
Oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Beer, Mead, and other Necessaries. His
Revenue out of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the Fur and <HI>Caviare,</HI> as also the
<HI>Ithyocolla</HI> and <HI>Agarick,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must needs be very
great, forasmuch as he monopolizes these Com∣modities.</P>
<P>Bath-stoves being so common in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that
there is not a Village so small, but has one or more
of them: The Impost laid upon those that keep
them for publick Use amounts to a vast Sum; But
as the Taverns and other Houses where strong Li∣quors
are sold, infinitely out-number the Bath∣stoves,
so the Revenue arising from to the Czar is
incredible; some of them being farm'd out at
2000, others at 6000, some at 10000 and 12000
<HI>Rubbles per Annum,</HI> reckoning a <HI>Rubble</HI> at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the rate of
8 Shillings Sterling.</P>
<P>It is to be imagined, that all these several Bran∣ches,
when united, must needs make up a vast
Treasure, but, if his Receippts are great, his Issues
and Expences are proportionable thereto. For, not
to insist here upon the extraordinary Splendor and
Pomp of his Court, the Presents and Expences be∣stowed
upon foreign Ambassadors, and the vast
<PB N="185" REF="101"/>
Consumption of all manner of Provisions of his
Table, and the rest of his Court, where above a
thousand Persons have Meat provided for them;
every day. His Military Expences are almost incre∣dible.
The vastness of his Territories obliges him to
keep above a hundred thousand Men in constant
Pay, which in time of War are sometimes aug∣mented
to three hundred thousand; His Wars are
more expensive to him than most other Princes of
<HI>Europe,</HI> by reason of the great number of foreign
Officers as well as Soldiers, he entertains in his Ar∣mies,
who are both very plentifully and punctually
paid; so, that notwithstanding the vastness of his
Revenues, at the commencement of any War, he
is obliged to lay extraordinary Impositions upon his
Subjects.</P>
<P>The Great Duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coin.</NOTE> having only the Power of
Coining Money, the same is commonly Farm'd out
to several Merchants of the Cities of <HI>Musco, No∣vogorod,
Twere</HI> and <HI>Plescou;</HI> these four Cities en∣joying
alone the Privilege of Coining, through∣out
all <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Their Silver Coin (for Gold they
have none, unless it be Medals) is of an Oval fi∣gure,
and very small, the biggest being worth but
a Penny, they call them <HI>Copees,</HI> or <HI>Denaing,</HI> have∣ing
on one side the Arms of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as we have
described it before, and on the other the Great
Duke's Name then Reigning; and that of the Ci∣ty,
where it is Coin'd. They have two lesser Sorts,
call'd <HI>Poluske</HI> and <HI>Mustofske;</HI> the first is worth half,
the second the fourth part of a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pee,</HI> both of Sil∣ver,
so that this small Money being so very trou∣blesome
to Tell; the <HI>Muscovites</HI> in their Trading
make up their Accompts by <HI>Altins, Grif,</HI> and <HI>Rub∣bles;</HI>
the first of these they count worth Three, the
second Ten, and the third a Hundred <HI>Copees;</HI> tho'
there▪ be no such Coin in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but only is
made use of in Commerce, to avoid the Multipli∣cation
of <HI>Copees.</HI> Besides this small Money, they
make use, for the most part, of <HI>Rixdollars,</HI> and
some <HI>Spanish Reals.</HI> The first they call <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="102"/>

whose Image was formerly Stampt upon one side
of these <HI>Rixdollars,</HI> and who hath communicated
his name to a certain City in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> call'd <HI>Joa∣chimstad,</HI>
where in the Year 1519, these <HI>Rixdollars</HI>
were first Coin'd, and are in <HI>Germany</HI> to this day,
call'd <HI>Joachim's Dollars.</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> rarely ap∣pears
in Publick, unless it be on Festivals, or some
other extraordinary Occasion, when he shews him∣self
in the utmost Splendor; none but his Dome∣sticks
and Lords in Office are admitted to approach
within the inward Court; The Guards which are
within the Court, are kept under so exact a Disci∣pline,
that they stand at their Duty, silent, and as
it were, immoveable. He dines but seldom in pu∣blick,
and whether at Dinner or Supper, there is
not the least Noise made by the Sounding of Trum∣pets
or otherwise, but a certain Officer goes to the
Cellar and Kitchen-door, where he calls to the Ser∣vant,
<HI>Godusar Kushinung,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Grand
Seignior would be Serv'd,</HI> when immediately, the
Meat is carried up. The Grand Duke always Dines
alone; but if he invites any of his Lords, they
are placed at another Table at some distance from
his, and are Served with the same Meat, that has
been presented to the Grand Duke. For, it is to
be observed, that the Grand Duke has always fifty
Dishes dress'd for his Dinner, which the Gentle∣men,
that bring them up all at once, hold so long
in their Hands, till the Carver hath shew'd them
to the Czar, who, after he has made choice of such
of them as he likes best, sends the rest to such Per∣sons
of Quality, as he has invited to Dinner, or if
he Dines alone, he sends those Dishes that have
been untouch'd, to some of his <HI>Boyars,</HI> to their
Houses.</P>
<P>There is a House of Pleasure at about three Miles
distance from the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> belonging to the
Great Dukes, where they goe once a Year, towards
the end of <HI>May.</HI> It is called <HI>Obrasauksky,</HI> which
is as much as <HI>Transfiguration,</HI> it being dedicated to
<PB N="187" REF="102"/>
the Transfiguration in the Mount. Here the <HI>Czar,</HI>
in imitation of these Words: <HI>Master, 'tis good for
us to be here, let us make three Tabernacles,</HI> has very
magnificent Tents set up, for him and his Retinue,
where he spends some time very retiredly, no bo∣dy
being admitted to disturb the <HI>Czar</HI> with any
Petitions, or other Business; Nay, round about
these Tents, are not only Rails, but Guards,
placed to hinder the approach of the People, whom
the <HI>Czar</HI> does not allow to be Eye-witnesses of his
Retirement.</P>
<P>It being an established Custom in <HI>Muscovy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Mar∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge▪</NOTE> as we
have said before, that the <HI>Czar</HI> never makes Alli∣ances
by way of Marriage with foreign Princes, he
always chuses one of his own Subjects, which is gene∣rally
done with a great deal of Secrecy, and ne∣ver
publish'd till after the Consummation of the
Marriage; forasmuch as the Person the <HI>Czar</HI> makes
Choice of (which is done by Tying a Crown upon
her Head) is exposed to the Envy and Malice of
such other Ladies, as have been refused by the
Prince, so that to avoid any dangerous consequen∣ces,
but especially the Charms of these Rival La∣dies,
which are much fear'd by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
there is scarce any thing known of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Mar∣riage,
till it is Proclaim'd by the Sound of the
Great Bell in <HI>Musco,</HI> perhaps the finest in the
World.</P>
<P>As the Fashion of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Cloaths is like that
of the Nobility,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Cza∣ritza▪</NOTE> but only richer; so the Dress of
the <HI>Czaritza</HI> or Empress is little different from o∣ther
Women; the Attire of her Head is something
higher, and her Smock Sleeves are much longer,
to wit, ten or twelve <HI>English</HI> Yards; besides that,
her Robe or uppermost Gown has wide Sleeves,
not unlike to those of our Batchellours of Arts:
These are worn by all her Women of Honour,
Chamber-Women, Ladies, and Embroideresses. The
Father or Brother of the <HI>Czaritza</HI> or Empress, dare
not call her his Daughter and Sister, nor dare
any of the Kindred own themselves so.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="103"/>
It is a general Custom among the <HI>Russians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Cza∣rovitz.</NOTE> not to
let their young Children be seen by any body, but
their nearest Relations, for fear Strangers should cast
some ill Aspect upon them. This is more strictly

none being permitted to see him, unless it be his

old, when he is exposed to publick View; At the
Birth of a <HI>Czarovitz,</HI> the people, to demonstrate
their Joy, bring great Presents to the Court, which
are, for the most part, return'd, but, if the <HI>Czar</HI>
likes any of them, he pays to the full Worth for
them. The <HI>Czar</HI>'s Children are attended by other
Children, bred up with them, who exactly know
their distance, and what manner of Respect is to
be paid to them, as well as other Persons, of what
degree soever. None of them dare speak the least

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Religion of the Muscovites, and their
Church Government.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Muscovites</HI> do all profess one and the
same Religion, which may be said to be par∣ticular
to them; forasmuch as it extends not be∣yond
the Grand Czar's Dominions, unless it be at
<HI>Narva,</HI> where some few <HI>Muscovites</HI> live under the
Jurisdiction of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and that there is some A∣nalogy
betwixt them and those Inhabiting the
<HI>Polish Russia,</HI> that profess the <HI>Greek</HI> Religion.
The <HI>Muscovites</HI> glory, that they are the only
True <HI>Christians</HI> now in the World; forasmuch
as they are baptized, whereas others have
been only Sprinkled, which is the Reason they
<PB N="189" REF="103"/>
alledge for Re-baptizing all such, of what
Persuasion soever, that embrace their Religion.
They profess, as they say, the true <HI>Greek</HI> Religion,
which makes them shew abundance of Respect and
Kindness to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> so that the <HI>Greek</HI> Monks
or Priests, which frequently come from other
parts into <HI>Muscovy</HI> with their Relicks, know how
to make an Advantage of their Simplicity and Ig∣norance.
They found their Religion on the Books
of the Old and New Testament. They are forbid∣den
to bring the whole Bible to Church (tho they
are allowed to read it at home) by reason of several
passages in the Old Testament; so that they only
carry the New Testament, and some certain chosen
Psalms and Verses taken out of the Prophets. It
is about threescore years ago that they got the Bible
translated into the <HI>Russian</HI> Language, wherein they
followed, as they pretend, the foot-steps of the
<HI>Seventy Interperters.</HI> They have also a certain Book,
which they call the <HI>History of the Gospel,</HI> but the
whole so adulterated with Fabulous Narrations, and
Impertinent Circumstances, that in another Chri∣stian
Country it would be so far from being look'd
upon as a Book of Devotion, that it would appear
abominable. As to the Explication of the Bible,
they follow St. <HI>Cyril</HI> Bishop of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who
flourish'd towards the latter end of the Fourth Age,
under the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Theodosius,</HI> and
ought not to be confounded with <HI>Cyril</HI> of <HI>Alexan∣dria.</HI>
The rest of the Fathers, which are in greatest
esteem among the <HI>Russians,</HI> are <HI>John Damascene,
Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> St. <HI>John Chysostome,</HI> and <HI>E∣phraim</HI>
the <HI>Syrian;</HI> of whom they relate, that an
Angel having presented to him a Book writ in Gol∣den
Characters, which no body could disclose, he
immediately received those Instructions from
thence, which he has transmitted in his Books to
Posterity. They relate out of their Annals, that
the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion was first established in these
parts by the Apostle St <HI>Andrew,</HI> who leaving
<HI>Greece,</HI> came to the <HI>Borysthenes,</HI> where he embark'd,
<PB N="190" REF="104"/>
and by the Sea of <HI>Ladoga,</HI> came to <HI>Novogorod,</HI>
where he Preach'd the Gospel. That the Christian
Religion was afterwards extirpated by the Neigh∣bouring
Pagans, who made themselves Masters of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> till in the Year 989. Prince <HI>Wolodimer,</HI>
or <HI>Ʋlodimer,</HI> Great Duke of <HI>Russia</HI> having given
them a signal Overthrow, and re-united several of
these Provinces to his Crown, grew so famous for
his great Atchievements, that <HI>Basilius</HI> and <HI>Constantine
Porphyrogennetae,</HI> Emperours of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> sent
their Ambassadours to Congratulate his good Suc∣cess;
and that by the Conversation and Instructions
of these Ambassadors, Prince <HI>Wolodimer</HI> was in∣duc'd
to embrace the Christian Faith, and to receive
Baptism. <HI>John Cropalates</HI> who writ part of the
<HI>Byzantine History,</HI> and lived much about the same
time, as also <HI>Cedren</HI> and <HI>Zonaras</HI> chiefly attribute
the Conversion of the <HI>Russians</HI> to the Christian Re∣ligion,
to a Miracle perform'd by a Bishop that was
sent thither by the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Constantinople</HI> to in∣struct
and baptize the people. For, these Infidels
having objected to him, That, since God had pre∣served
<HI>Daniel</HI>'s Companions in the Fiery Furnace,
why might not with the same, or more reason, the
Bible be prevented by God's power, from being
consumed by Fire? The Bishop, after having told
them that he was assured he could not ask any thing
from God, which he could not obtain by his prayers,
cast the Bible into a great Fire, made for that pur∣pose,
where having lain till the Fire was all spent,
it was taken out as entire and untouch'd as it was
cast in, whereat <HI>Wolodimer</HI> being moved, abolish'd
all Idolatry, and in lieu thereof, planted Christia∣nity
in all his Territories. From hence it is, that
they deduce the Origin of their Religion from the
<HI>Greek</HI> Church, which however, they have much
alter'd since.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="104"/>
The Creed of <HI>Athanasius</HI> is the general Rule of
their Faith, for they believe in <HI>God the Father</HI> as
Creator of the World, in <HI>God the Son,</HI> as Saviour
and Redeemer of Mankind, and in <HI>the Holy Ghost,</HI>
as Sanctifier of all the Faithful; but for the rest,
they are involved in a great many Superstitions,
and fix the Center of their Devotion, more in the
outward and Ceremonial Part, than in the Internal
Part of Religion. They pay their Venerations
to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> the <HI>Apostles,</HI>
and an infinite number of other Saints, not only
as Intercessors, but Co-operators of their Salvation,
for they pay to their Saints and Images all
the Honours due to none but God Almighty.
There is never a Family so small in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scovy,</HI> but
what has its Tutelar Saint's Image hung up against
the Wall of the Chamber, unto whom the igno∣rant
People pay their daily Devotion, and all the
religious Instructions they give to their Children,
tends to no more, than to stand with a great deal of
Respect, and to say their Prayers before those I∣mages;
for the rest, they place the utmost Excel∣lency
of their good Works (which they believe me∣ritorious)
in building of Monasteries and Churches,
and giving Alms. Those who intend to change
their Religion, and embrace the <HI>Muscovian,</HI> are
obliged to go for six Weeks into some Monastery or
another, where all the Instructions they receive, is,
how to say their Prayers, how to reverence
their Saints and Images, and how to make the
Cross.</P>
<P>The whole Exercise of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Religion,
may be reduced under these several Heads, <HI>viz.</HI>
Baptism, Reading of the Word of God in their
Churches, going to Mass, Praying to Saints, and
making Reverences before their Images, Processions,
Pilgrimages, Fastings, Confession and Commu∣nion.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="105"/>
Baptism,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Bap∣tism.</NOTE> they look upon as the most necessary
Point of Religion; they acknowledge themselves
conceived and born in Sin, and that by Baptism,
they are regenerated and cleansed, according to
God's Institution, from their original Impurity.
They baptize their Children as soon as they are
born; and, unless they be too weak (when
they Baptize them at home, but never in the
same Room where the Mother lies) they are
carried to Church by the Godfather and Godmo∣ther,
where being met at the Door by the Priest,
he signs the Child with the Sign of the Cross in
the Forehead, and gives him the Benediction,
saying. <HI>The Lord preserve thy coming in, and
thy going out.</HI> Then they walk up together to
the Font, which stands in the middle of
the Church, cross which, the Priest fastens nine
lighted Wax-Candles, delivered to him by the
Godfathers, whom he Incenses, and Consecrates
the Water with a great many Ceremonies. Then
the Procession begins about the Font; the Clerk
goes before with the Image of St. <HI>John,</HI> being
followed by the Godfathers, with Wax-Can∣dles
in their Hands; thus they go about it
three times, whilst the Priest Reads out of a
Book. The Procession being over, the Godfa∣thers
give the Name of the Child to the
Priest, in Writing, upon his Demand, who
puts it upon an Image, which he holds upon
the Child's Breast, and after some short Pray∣ers,
asks the God-fathers, Whether <HI>the Child
believes in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</HI>
Having answer'd, Yes, they all turn their
Backs to the Font, as a Sign of their Aver∣sion
to the three next following Questions,
to be asked by the Priest, to' wit; Whether
<HI>the Child forsakes the Devil?</HI> Whether <HI>he for∣sakes
his Angels?</HI> Whether <HI>he forsakes his
Works?</HI> The Godfathers answering, Yes,
distnctly to every Question, and Spit∣ting
three times upon the Ground.
<PB N="293" REF="105"/>
Then they face about again to the Font▪ and being asked
by the Priest, whether they promise to bring up the
Child in the true <HI>Greek</HI> Religion, they advance with
the Child nearer towards the Door (for fear the De∣vil,
by whom they believe Children to be possess'd
before Baptism, should take up his Residence in the
Church) where he begins the Exorcism, putting
his Hands upon, and blowing three times cross the
Child with these Words: <HI>Get out of this Child thou
unclean Spirit, and make way for the Holy Ghost.</HI> Then
returning to the Font, he cuts off a little of the
Childs Hair, which he puts into a Book, and, ha∣ving
asked the God-fathers, whether the Child was
brought thither to be Baptized, he takes him stark
Naked into his Arms, and dips him three times into
the Water, pronouncing the Words of the Sacra∣ment
in the mean while, <HI>viz. I Baptize thee in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.</HI> Immediately after the Baptism, he signs it
with the sign of the Cross on the Forehead, upon
the Hands, Breast and Back, with a certain Oyl
consecrated for that purpose, and having put a corn
of Salt in the Child's Mouth, and a clean Shirt a∣bout
him, <HI>Thou art,</HI> says he, <HI>as clean and as clear from
thy Original Sin, as thy Shirt.</HI> Then the Priest hangs
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout his Neck a little Cross of Gold, Silver or
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead, according to the Ability of the Parents, with

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich is observed with so much strictness by the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> that they deny Christian Burial to such
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have it not about them, at their last Exit out of
his World. The whole is concluded by the Priest's
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igning the Child a certain Saint, whose Image he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>livers to the God-father, and charges him to take
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ectual care, that, the Child, as soon as he is come

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Patron. Lastly, he takes his leave from the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hild and God-fathers with a Kiss, exhorting them
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mutual Love, but to take heed of intermarry∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="106"/>
The Water, wherein the Child is to be Bapti∣zed,
is never Warmed over the Fire, though the
Cold be never so excessive, but they put it some∣times
in some warm place or other, to take off a
little of the cold. If two or more Children are to
be Baptized at the same Font, the Water is emptied
so often as there are several Children to be Baptized,
it being their Opinion, that the Water which is
contaminated with the Original Sin of the first Child,
is not pure enough to cleanse the second or third
from their Impurities. Persons of Age who change
their Religion, and embrace the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Faith, nay,
even <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who having changed their Religi∣on
in another Country, are willing to return to their
own Communion, must be first Re-baptized, which
is always done in a Brook or River, where they are
plunged over Head and Ears, be it never so Cold,
nay, they oftentimes break through the Ice to come
at the Water.</P>
<P>In the same manner are treated those whom the
<HI>Russians</HI> call <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> who being look'd upon by
them as Infidels, and who during the time they
commit their Extravagancies, have withdrawn them∣selves
from the Church, must be reconciled to it, by
Re-baptization on <HI>Twelfth-day,</HI> as that on which hap∣pened
the Vocation of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> They are a
Company of idle Vagabond Fellows, who, in Com∣memoration
of <HI>Sadrach, Mesack</HI> and <HI>Abednego,</HI> that

represent the Men that heated the Oven; for
which purpose, pursuant to an Ancient Custom, they
get leave from the Patriarch, to Disguise themselves,
and to run up and down the Streets with Fire-works,
from the Eighteenth Day of <HI>December,</HI> till <HI>Twelve∣tide:</HI>
During which time, they commit great Inso∣lencies,
exacting small Gifts from the Peasants whose
Hair and Beards they set on Fire upon refusal. On
<HI>Twelfth-day,</HI> when their License is expired, they are
Re-baptized (some of them having been Baptized
Ten or Twelve times) and lookt upon as good
Christians. Those that intend to Embrace the <HI>Russi∣an</HI>

the same Month.</P>
<P>There is scarce a Day in the Year, but what is de∣dicated
to one Saint, or another; nay, sometimes
three or four Saints have but one Day allotted be∣twixt
them: But these being of an inferiour Degree,
are not much regarded by the Laity; the Ecclesia∣sticks
being only obliged to say the Offices appoint∣ed
for those Days.</P>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Muscovites</HI> made but an indifferent
Account of their Festivals and <HI>Sundays;</HI> for, though
they would go to Mass in the Morning, the Shops
were open, and the Handycraft's-Man did follow
his ordinary Employment in the Afternoons; till
about Fifty Years ago, by a special Order from the
Patriarch, the Shops were ordered to be shut, not
only upon these Festivals and <HI>Sundays,</HI> but also on
their Weekly Fasting-days; to wit, on <HI>Wednesdays</HI>
and <HI>Fridays:</HI> And that during the Time of Divine
Service, no Wine or <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> should be sold; but
this is not executed with too much Rigour; at least,
they seldom fail to conclude them with Strong Li∣quors.</P>
<P>Upon these above-mentioned Festivals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Church-Service.</NOTE> and <HI>Sun∣days,</HI>
they go to Church three times a Day; first, in
the Morning early, to Mattens; at Noon; and in
the Evening, to Vespers. They do not make use,
in their Service, of any Sermons, or Instructions to
their Auditors; but only read certain Passages out of
the Bible, and some Homilies: Giving for a Reason,
That their Faith being founded upon the pure Word
of God, it is, without any farther Explication, suf∣ficient
to lead them into the Way of Salvation; for
<PB N="297" REF="107"/>
as much as the divers Interpretations of the Holy
Scripture occasion Heresies and Divisions in the
Church. This they lay down as so unalterable a
Maxim▪ that some of their Priests, who were, per∣haps,
not quite so ignorant as the rest, and under∣took
to preach, and exhort the People out of the
Holy Scripture, have been excommunicated, and
banished into <HI>Siberia;</HI> as it happen'd about 60 Years
ago, to a certain Proto-Pope of <HI>Morum,</HI> and his Fol∣lowers.
Their whole Service therefore consists in
the Reading of certain Chapters out of the Bible,
some Psalms, and St. <HI>Athanasius</HI>'s Creed: Sometimes
they add an Homily out of St. <HI>Chrys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stom,</HI> or certain
Prayers, or rather Anthems; sung much after the
same manner as the <HI>Antiphona's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The general Morning-Anthems are,</HI> Deliver me, O
Lord, of thy abundant Mercy: For thy Mercy's sake,
cleanse me from my Sins; O Lord, my Saviour. <HI>This
is for the Mattens, or Morning-Prayers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At Noon-Prayers, this Anthem is used, amongst
others;</HI> We trust in Christ, our Saviour; and our Hope
is in him: Halleluja; Halleluja.</P>
<P><HI>That for the Vespers, is;</HI> Lord, hear my Prayer,
and hear me when I call; and let my Cry come unto
thee.</P>
<P>At the Conclusion of these, or any other of their
Anthems, the People repeat three times (making
every time the Sign of the Cross) their <HI>Gospodi Pomi∣lui;</HI>
or, <HI>Lord, have Mercy upon me.</HI></P>
<P>This done, the Priest, attended by the Clerk,
goes up to the Altar, where he says the Office, ac∣cording
to the Liturgy of St. <HI>Basil.</HI> He pours Red
Wine and Water (in Imitation of the Blood and
Water that came out of our Saviour's Side) into the
Chalice, with some little Bits of Leaven'd Bread;
and after having consecrated them, and said several
Prayers, he takes out the Bread with a Spoon, but
gives nothing of it to any body, unless it be to some
sick Child, brought thither on purpose to receive the
Communion according to the Institution of the <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
Church. They are all bare in the Church,
<PB N="298" REF="108"/>
even the Great Duke himself. The People stand all
the Service-time, and incessantly bow and pay their
Reverences to the Images, frequently pronouncing
<HI>Gospodi Pomilui</HI> or <HI>Lord have Mercy upon me.</HI> The
most Devout prostrate themselves, knocking their
H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds against the Ground; especially at <HI>Whitsun∣tid▪</HI>
when they fall prostrate upon Sycamore-Bran∣ches
wherewith their Churches are strewed; being
perswaded that the Holy Ghost descends upon these
Leaves. The Priests only have the Liberty of keep∣ing
on their Caps, which are given them at their
Consecration. But if a Priest have known his Wife,
if he have touched a dead Corps, or been at a Bu∣rial,
he is not to offici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te at the Altar the same Day,
but is obliged to substitute another in his Place.
The most Devout keep at a distance, not entring the
Church, but perform their Devotion at the Door,
among the Women: The fair Sex (as if they were
not sufficiently disciplined at home) having this, as
an additional Mortification, enjoined them, that
they must keep at a distance at Church; especially
if they have chanced to take the Husband in a good
Humour, and enjoyed lately the Pleasures of Matri∣mony.
In which Case also the Man is confined to
the Church-door, unless he have, after having had
Knowledge of his Wife, washed and bathed him∣self,
and put on a clean Shirt. If the <HI>Russian</HI> Wo∣men
were as constant Church-Women as our Ladies,
they would be obliged to build their Porches bigger
than the Churches.</P>
<P>Most of these Festivals are also solemnized among
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> with Processions, among which, that
upon <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> representing the Entrance of our
Saviour into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> is performed in the Presence
of the Great Duke, and the Patriarch himself, in the
City of <HI>Mosco;</HI> and throughout the whole Kingdom,
by the Wayvodes and Metropolitans of the Provin∣ces,
who represent the Great Duke and Patriarch.</P>
<P>The Great Duke goes from the Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Process<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣on <HI>Palm-Sunday.</HI></NOTE> with the
Patriarch, to the Church called <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> without
the Castle-Gate, in the following Order: After a
<PB N="299" REF="108"/>
Hundred, or more, Scavengers have cleared the Way
through which the Procession is to pass, there first
comes a very large Chariot, most like a Pageant,
drawn by six Horses; in which is placed a Tree,
garnished with abundance of Apples, Figs and
Grapes, which are fasten'd to the Branches: Round
about it are placed four or five Lads, with Surplisses,
singing <HI>Hosannah.</HI> Next to the Chariot come a great
many Priests, in their Surplisses and Copes; some
carrying Books and Crosses, others Banners and Ima∣ges
upon long Poles; some sing, others cast Incense
among the People. After these, march the Duke's
Factors and Merchants; then the Secretaries, <HI>Knez</HI>
and <HI>Boyares,</HI> who go immediately before the Great
Duke, most of them with Palm twigs in their Hands.
The Grand Duke himself marches on foot, richly
clad, with a Crowned Bonnet upon his Head; sup∣ported
on both sides by two of the principal <HI>Bojares,</HI>
or Counsellors of State; and leading by the Bridle,
which is three or four Yards long the Patriarch's
Horse: This Horse, which is covered all over with
a White Fine Linnen Cloth, is disguised like an Ass,
with great Artificial Ears; upon which the Patriarch
rides sideling, having upon his Head a round low
Crowned Cap, with a narrow Brim, lined with E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mins,
and richly beser with Pearls, over which ap∣pears
a kind of a Diadem: In his Right Hand he
has a Cross of Diamonds, wherewith he blesses the
People, who receive his Benediction with very low
Submissions, bowing their Heads to the Ground, and
making the Sign of the Cross. He is surrounded by
Metropolitans, and other Priests; whereof, some
carry Books, others Censers. As they pass along,
there are a great Number of Boys placed on both
sides of the Way, some of which pull off their up∣per
Garments, which they scatter along the Way;
others lay Pieces of Cloth, of several Yard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long,
upon the Ground, for the Great Duke and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to pass over.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Thus they march to the above men∣tioned
Church, where having stay'd above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an
Hour, they return in the same Order, till they come
<PB N="300" REF="109"/>
to a certain Plat-form, where the Patriarch, after ha∣ving
presented the <HI>Czar</HI> and some of the <HI>Bojares</HI> with
Palm-twigs, takes off the Great Duke's Cap, and
having laid it upon a Silver Plate, he presents his
Diamond-Cross to him to kiss: This being done with
a most profound Reverence by the <HI>Czar,</HI> the Patri∣arch
waves it on high, all round about, first towards
those upon the Plat-form, who also receive this Be∣nediction
with the utmost Respect; and then to all
the People▪ who at the same Instant prostrate them∣selves
upon the Ground, especially the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Guards
that attend there▪ and upon this Occasion, appear the
most zealous in their Devotion. They conclude with
some Hymns, which having lengthen'd the whole
Devotion to an Hour, the Procession marches from
thence, back to the Castle▪ in the same manner as
they went first to the Church. The Patriarch, as
an Acknowledgment of the Honour received from
His <HI>Czarrish</HI> Majesty, in leading his Horse, presents
him with a Purse, containing to the Value of an Hun∣dred
Guineas.</P>
<P>Eight Days after this Procession is the Feast of <HI>Ea∣ster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their</HI> Ea∣ster.</NOTE>
which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> celebrate with great Cere∣monies,
and Rejoicings; as well in Remembrance of
the Resurrection of our Saviour, as that it puts an
End to their Mortifications which they have endu∣red
in their <HI>Lent.</HI> Their Rejoicings continue for 15
Days during which they feast▪ one another with all
manner of good Cheer▪ and to make thmselves a full
Amends for their Sufferings during the <HI>Lent,</HI> they
ply the Drinking-Houses so warmly, that they are
filled up every where with Persons of all sorts, Men
and Women, Ecclesiasticks and Laicks; and the
Streets almost not to be passed, for the Multitudes of
Drunkards at Night. They sell for these fifteen
Days Eggs ready d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, of all sorts of Colours, but
especially of a Red, or Crimson; which they send
as Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nts to one another, to some, one; some, two;
some three: And if they meet one another in this
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they salute one another with these Words,
<HI>Christes wos chrest,</HI> that is, <HI>Christ is risen:</HI> Whereto
<PB N="301" REF="109"/>
the other having answered, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stin wos Chrest;</HI> that
is, <HI>He is certainly risen;</HI> they kiss one another: He
that salutes first, is obliged to present the other with
an Egg; no body, of what Condition, Sex or Qua∣lity
soever, daring to refuse either the Kiss, or the
Egg. The Great Duke himself does not only pre∣sent
Eggs to the principal Counsellors and Lords of
his Court, but also to his Military Officers residing
in the City of <HI>Musco;</HI> who all come to kiss his
Hand, and His Majesty imparts to them his Royal
Benediction.</P>
<P>They have many such like Processions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Procession on the First of <HI>Octo∣ber.</HI></NOTE> upon se∣veral
Occasions; and the Great Duke goes frequent∣ly
on Pilgrimage, with his whole Court. The First
of <HI>October</HI> is, among other Days, celebrated with a
great deal of Ceremony. The Great Duke, attend∣ed
by his <HI>Bojares,</HI> and Officers of his Houshold; and
the Patriarch, accompanied by some Metropolitans,
and a great Number of other Priests, with Books
and Crosses in their Hands, go in Procession to the
same Church we have mentioned before, called by
them, that of the <HI>Blessed Trinity;</HI> and by the <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI>
and most other Strangers, <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> But be∣fore
they come quite to the Church, there is a Thea∣tre
erected on the Right Hand as you go to it, railed
in all about; before which are planted two great
Pieces of Cannon, whereof the Bore is near half an
Ell Diameter. The Grand Duke and Patriarch,
without admitting any body else, being got within
the Rails, upon the Theatre, the Patriarch presents
to the Great Duke a certain Image, painted upon a
piece of Past-board which folds together in the Mid∣dle,
not unlike a Book, and is enriched with Silver
at the four Corners; to which the <HI>Czar</HI> makes a very
low Reverence, touching it with his Forehead, whilst
the Priests without the Rails are muttering over cer∣tain
Prayers, appointed for that Solemnity. This
done, the Patriarch presents to him a Golden Cross,
beset with Diamonds, of about a Foot in length;
which, after the Great Duke has kissed, the Patriarch
touches his Forehead and Temples with it; and so
<PB N="302" REF="110"/>
to Church they go, where the Service is performed,
and the Solemnity ended for that Day.</P>
<P>With no less Solemnity they celebrate their <HI>New-Years-Day,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their New-Years-Day.</NOTE>
which is the first of <HI>September;</HI> they ha∣ving
no other Epache but that of the Creation of the
World, as we have mentioned before. This Pro∣cession
is performed in the Castle, where a considera∣ble
number of the People are permitted to partake of
the Benediction given them by the Patriarch. He,
attended by three or four Hundred Priests, carrying
Banners, Images, Crosses, and Books, comes out of
the Church, which is on the Right Hand of the Se∣cond
Court of the Castle, while the Great Duke with
his <HI>Knez, Bojares,</HI> and other Officers of his Court,
comes out on the Left Hand of the same Court. The
Grand Duke with his Cap in his Hand, and the Pa∣triarch
with his Mitre on his Head, and a Cross be∣set
with Diamonds a Foot long in his Hand, advan∣cing
to one another, the Patriarch presents the Cross
to the Great Duke to kiss; which he having done
with a most profound Respect, the Patriarch gives
his Benediction first to the Czar, and afterwards to
all the rest there present, wishing them all Prosperity
in the New Year.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Images,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ima∣ges.</NOTE> they suffer not
any that are Carved or Graven, either in their Chur∣ches
or Houses; because, say they, these are forbid∣den
in the Decalogue; but their Images are painted
with Oil upon Wood. The best of all is, That they
will not admit of any painted by Foreigners, though
done by the greatest Masters of <HI>Europe;</HI> but they
must be painted by one of their own Religion: So
that for Colour, Painting, and Proportion they are
the most wretched in the whole World, being about
a Foot in Breadth, and not quite a Foot and a half
in length. There is in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> as we have
mentioned in the Second Chapter, a certain Street
appointed for the Sale of these Images; though a
<HI>Muscovite</HI> will never own to have bought his Saint:
For which reason, when any one of them has cho∣sen
an Image in the God-market, he deposits Mo∣ney
<PB N="303" REF="110"/>
for the Exchange of it; if the Saint-maker
thinks it not sufficient, he shoves it back, and the
other Party is obliged to add more to it, till both
Parties are contented. They will own, that during
the first Centuries, even till the Time of <HI>Constantine</HI>
the Great, Images were not used in the Church; or,
if they were, no Worship was paid them. They
alledge that they follow in this Point the Authority
and Opinion of <HI>John Damascene,</HI> though it is more
likely they have taken them from the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.
The Walls of their Churches are every where full
of them, as they are the chief Ornaments of their
Houses, every Family having its Saint with a small
Wax-Candle before it, which they light when they
pay their Devotion. Over the Porch of their Chur∣ches,
in the Market-places, and over the Gates of
their Cities you are sure to meet with the Picture of
some Saint or another, but especially with that of
the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Patron of
<HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>These Images the <HI>Muscovites</HI> respect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ration of Saints.</NOTE> and look
upon as things so absolutely necessary, that without
them they could not perform their Devotion. As of∣ten
as they address their Prayers to them, they set
Wax Candles before that Saint to whom they intend
to make their Addresses; and after they have made
most profound Inclinations with their Heads, they
frequently make the Sign of the Cross with three Fin∣gers
of their Right Hand, touching first the Forehead,
next the Breast, lastly the Right Shoulder, and the
Left after that. They conceive in this way of cros∣sing
themselves a great deal of Mystery; for, they
say, the Three Fingers signifie the Trinity; by
their putting them to their Forehead, they would
shew that Christ is ascended into Heaven; by
crossing the Breast, that God ought to be reverenced
and loved with all our Heart. But as to making
the Sign of the Cross from the Right Shoulder to the
Left, they intend to signifie the Day of Judgment;
forasmuch as it is said, <HI>That God shall place the Righ∣teous
on his Right Hand, to be called to Eternal Salva∣tion;
<PB N="304" REF="111"/>
and the wicked on the Left, to be thrown into the
Abyss of Hell.</HI></P>
<P>If they pass by any of their Images in the Street,
they make a stand for a while before them, till they
have made their Reverence four or five times one af∣ter
another, which is done by crossing themselves,
and pronouncing with a loud Voice their <HI>Gospodi Po∣milui,</HI>
or <HI>God have mercy upon me.</HI></P>
<P>They address themselves with the same Venerati∣on
to such Crosses as they meet with in their way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cros∣ses.</NOTE>
where they are frequently observed to stop, and re∣peat
the same Ejaculations. The first, nay, the only
thing Parents teach their Children, is, to make their
Reverences and Inclinations to the Images, to make
the Sign of the Cross, and to say the <HI>Gospodi Pomilui,</HI>
or <HI>God have mercy upon me.</HI> The <HI>Muscovites</HI> don't
undertake any thing, nor Eating nor Drinking, or
whatever else it may be, without making first the Sign
of the Cross, which may well be called the Intro∣duction
to all the Civil Actions of the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>The Tutelar Saints of private Houses have common∣ly
their Stations assign'd them in a Corner behind the
Table. Whenever a <HI>Muscovite</HI> comes into a House,
the first thing he does is to go straightways to the Saint
of the House; if he cannot find him, he asks, <HI>Jest le
Boch,</HI> or <HI>Where is the God?</HI> After he has found him
out, he pays his Reverence to him, saying his <HI>Gospo∣di
Pomilui,</HI> or <HI>Lord have mercy upon me;</HI> and then
turns about and salutes the Company. If they are to
take a merry turn with a Woman in the Room where
the Saint is, they are sure to cover him first▪ perhaps▪ for
fear he should tell tales. They will not allow Strangers
to touch them, or for any Body to sleep in the same
Room, with their Feet towards them; nay, some are
so nice, as to purifie the Chamber with Incense, if any
Strangers of another Religion have lodged in it.</P>
<P>They will hold their Images to the Fire, believing
they have a Power to extinguish it if they please.
The <HI>Swedish</HI> Soldiers, who in the Year 1610. had
taken and burnt the City of <HI>Novogorod,</HI> when they
saw the Inhabitants presenting their Images to stay
<PB N="305" REF="111"/>
the Progress of the Flames, being convinced of their
Fondness to them, and not finding any thing else in
their Houses worth taking, carried away their Ima∣ges,
which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> afterwards redeemed at a
very good Rate. In time of Fire▪ they strive, before all
other things, to save their Images; but if they, or
a Church happen to be burnt, they would look up∣on
it as a great Disgrace to say the Saint or Church is
burnt; but they say, They are ascended. When the
Image is become obliterate or rotten, they either bu∣ry
it with a great deal of Ceremony, or else (which
is the general way) throw it into some River, and
commit it to the Chance of the Current; at parting
they cross themselves, and cry, <HI>Prosti, Farewel.</HI> Persons
of great Fortunes or Quality adorn their Saints with
Pearls or precious Stones; but these Demy-Gods
are so tenacious of what they have once got into their
Clutches, that they will never part with any of it
again to the Owners, though never so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecessitous.
There are not wanting Examples, that, upon a pinch,
some have made bold to borrow of their Saints against
their Will, what formerly was their own, who have
paid for it with the loss of both their Hands. If any
one is excommunicated, his Saint, as well as his Per∣son,
is excluded from the Church.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovian</HI> Monks and Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mi∣racles.</NOTE> as ignorant as
they are in other matters, have been cunning enough
not to despoil the Saints of the Art of doing Miracles.
At <HI>Archangel</HI> there was once a Gang of them, who, by
such Impostures, had got a considerable Sum of Mo∣ney
together; but falling out among themselves
when they were dividing the Spoil, the Fraud was
discovered, and so had a good Whipping for their
pains. It must be owned, there are but few Instances
of this nature among the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> they being else
too zealous to call in question the Omnipotency of
their Saints, whom they believe to have at least some∣thing
of Divinity in them. In the Year 1643. an
old Image had began to change Colour, and to turn
a little reddish. This was immediately cry'd up
not only for a Miracle, but rather for an ill Omen,
<PB N="306" REF="112"/>
or some Bloody Presage, to that Degree, that the
Great Duke and the Patriarch being frightned there∣at,
as well as the People, preparations were ma∣king
for an extrordinary Fast-day, and publick
Prayers to be made all over the Kingdom; but some
of the <HI>Bojares</HI> having thought it convenient to call
together all the Painters about the City, they
brought in their Verdict: That they believed there
was nothing ominous in the matter, forasmuch as
they were assured, that time having consumed the
Paint, had only discovered the colour of the Wood,
which was Red: Among others of their miraculous
Saints, they have two of a late Date; the Name of
the first was, <HI>Sudatworets Philip Metropolite,</HI> he li∣ved
in the Reign of that famous Tyrant, <HI>John Basi∣lovits,</HI>
unto whom he used constantly to make re∣monstrances
of his wicked Life and Cruelties, till
the Great Duke not able any longer to endure his
Reprehensions, caused him to be slain by one of his
Servants; since which time he has been reckoned
among their Holy Martyrs, and been famous for
the Miracles they have attributed to him, which
were formerly performed at <HI>Archangle,</HI> near which
he was Buried in the Isle of <HI>Solofka</HI> in the <HI>White Sea,</HI>
but has been since from thence translated to the City
of <HI>Musco,</HI> and placed in the great Church of the
Castle; where for some time he did most surprising
Miracles, by healing the Dumb, Deaf, Blind, Agues,
and Paraliticks: But of late Years, it seems, the
Saint is grown Weary of his Profession of Physick,
though they affirm, that his Body remains entire
to this day, which is not easie to be disproved, since
it is forbidden upon pain of Death, to lift up the
Cloath which covers the Body of the Saint.</P>
<P>The second, and the topping Saint of all <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
for Miracles, is one <HI>Sergius,</HI> whose Residence was
in the Monastery of <HI>Troitza,</HI> about threescore Miles
distant from the City of <HI>Musco.</HI> This Saint as it
seems, was in his younger Days, a Military Person
of a very graceful Aspect, but having taken a Di∣staste
at that Profession, and abandoned his vicious
<PB N="307" REF="112"/>
course of Life, turn'd first <HI>Hermite,</HI> and afterwards
got into the Monastery of <HI>Troitza,</HI> which from his
Name, ever since his Burial there, has been called
<HI>Zergeofski Troitza,</HI> it being formerly Dedicated to the
<HI>Trinity,</HI> where being soon after chosen Abbot, he,
and one of his Disciples, called <HI>Nikon,</HI> grew so fa∣mous
for the many Miracles they performed, that
they were both Canonized after their Death, which
hapned in the Year 1563. Their Heads, as they
say, do not only remain entire to this day, but also
that of <HI>Sergius</HI> (if one may believe them) has not
lost its Military Operation; for, when this Mona∣stery
was Besieged by the <HI>Poles,</HI> the Head of <HI>Sergius</HI>
only forced them to raise the Siege, having caused
them to turn their Arms against themselves, during
the Assault: 'Tis true, this Monastery was Besieged
by the <HI>Poles,</HI> under their General <HI>John Sapicha,</HI> who
was forced to abandon the Enterpize, and thus far
the <HI>Monks</HI> are in the right of it, but they were mi∣staken
in the true circumstances of the matter; for,
asmuch as it was not the Head of their Saint, or
their own Bravery, put the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army that oblig∣ed
the <HI>Poles,</HI> to raise the Siege: But they are not u∣sed
to examine Miracles with so much nicety here;
for notwithstanding this, the Great Dukes goe thi∣ther
generally twice a Year to do their Devotion,
and when they come at two Miles distance from
the Monastery, alight from their Horses, walking
the rest of the way on foot. Having performed their
Devotion, they spend some days in Hunting, du∣ring
which time, the Abbot entertains the Great
Duke, and his whole Retinue. The <HI>Muscovites</HI> fre∣quently
perform here their Vows of going on Pil∣grimage,
and bestowing their Alms, made perhaps
in their Travels or Sickness, which with the Liberali∣ty
of the Great Dukes, has encreased the Revenues
of this Monastery to that Degree, that it is accoun∣ted
one of the Richest and the most Beautiful in all
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> and maintains a great number of Monks.</P>
<P>There is also a Church Dedicated to the Holy
Mother of <HI>Casan,</HI> whither many Pilgrimages which are
<PB N="308" REF="113"/>
made by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> as also to <HI>Chutina,</HI> about
Eight Miles distant from <HI>Novogorod,</HI> to the Sepulchre
of one of their Saints, called <HI>Werlam,</HI> who being
Born at <HI>Novogorod,</HI> was Buried near the said Mona∣stery
of <HI>Chutina.</HI></P>
<P>On the Eve of the Pentecost they perform certain a
naual Devotions in Memory of their departed
Friends, with a great deal of Formality, but in a
manner very Ridiculous.</P>
<P>Those of their Churches which are of Stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Churches.</NOTE> are
all round and Vaulted, because, they say, they have
thus a nearer resemblance to Heaven, which is the
Throne of God. These have in the midst of four
Turrets, a Tower form'd at the Top, not unlike the
Knobs we put on our Bedsteads, having upon it a
Triple Cross: This is to represent our Saviour, as
the head of the Church, and the Cross being the
Badge of Christianity, they think fit, the Church of
Christ should be distinguish'd by it from others.
Within are neither Seats nor Benches, because none
sit down, but all perform their Devotions, either
standing, or prostrating themselves. They don't
make use of Organs, or any other Musical Instru∣ments
in their Churches, being perswaded, that things
inanimate, cannot glorifie God. They believe their
Churches profaned by the Entrance of any Stranger
that is not of the same Communion▪ wherefore they
are not admitted, and as soon as Discovered, thrust
out. But if a Dog chances to come into the Church,
they first sweep, and afterwards purifie it with In∣cense
and Holy Water; they also shew a great deal
of respect for their Church-yards.</P>
<P>Their Bells are not hung in Steeples like ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls.</NOTE>
but placed in a certain Engine, built for that purpose
in the Church-yard, near the Church: They are
for the most part very small (tho' <HI>Muscovy</HI> has else
the greatest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bell perhaps in the World) seldom ex∣ceeding
200 Weight. The Ropes are not fastned
to the Bells, but to the Clapper, and they fasten
two of these Ropes to both Arms near the Elbows,
and two more to both hands of a Man, so that one
<PB N="309" REF="113"/>
single Person may make a Chiming, in which the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> take extraordinary delight, tho' it sounds
but very indifferently to those that are used to bet∣ter;
they Toll them at the beginning of Services,
and at the Elevation of the Chalice; for, the Bread
being put in immediately after the Consecration in∣to
the Wine, they make but one Elevation; they
reckon the Chiming of Bells so essential a part of
Divine Service, that they believe it to be imperfect
without it.</P>
<P>If there be any Religion in the World that obliges
its Professors to a most severe Mortification,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Feasts▪</NOTE> it is
certainly the <HI>Muscovian;</HI> for as if it were not suffi∣cient
to have enjoyned the keeping of two constant
Fast-days in the Week, to wit, the <HI>Wednesday</HI> and
<HI>Friday,</HI> and the Eves before Holy Days, when they
are obliged to abstain so strictly from all kind of
Flesh, that they must not make use of Eggs and
Milk, they have four Lents every Year: The long∣est
of them is like ours of seven Weeks; the second
begins Eight Days after the <HI>Pentecost,</HI> and lasts till
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Day; the third holds from the first of <HI>Au∣gust,</HI>
to the Sixteenth of the same Month; and the
fourth from the twelfth of <HI>November</HI> till <HI>Christmass
Day.</HI> During all these Lents, they eat neither But∣ter,
nor Eggs, nor Milk, much less Flesh, unless it
be in the first Week of the long Lent, which being
their Carnaval, they have liberty for all manner of
excesses, except Fish. In this Week, their Extra∣travagances
are almost past belief, and as if this time
was alloted them as a preparative to their Fastings,
they commit such Debauches in double distilled
Brandies and melted Butter, which they pour down
their Throats, that they are all kindled in a Flame,
and if they are not immediately quenched with Milk,
they die upon the Spot. Woe, to any Stranger that
meets these Drunkards at Night, without being well
guarded, their Insolencies being so great, that with
Fightings, Quarrels and Murthers, commonly Forty
or more Persons are Murthered in a Night, during
this Week; not to reckon those, who being over∣charged
<PB N="310" REF="114"/>
with Liquors, and wanting Attendance to
carry them Home, fell down upon the Snow, and
so are Frozen to Death. It is a most dismal Specta∣cle,
to behold perhaps Ten or a Dozen of these in
the Morning, carried upright in a Sledge, Frozen
to Death, some having their Faces Gnawed, others
their Arms eaten off by Dogs, others to have nothing
left but the bare Bones; and yet these are the daily
Objects one meets with in the Streets of <HI>Musco,</HI> du∣ring
this time of Debauchery. All the attonement
they make for these Enormities, is, That the next
Week after they live upon Honey, Herbs and Pulse,
and Drink only Quus, or small Mead, and Water;
and to cleanse themselves from the Impurities con∣tracted
in these excessive Debauches, they dont for∣get
to visit the Bath-stoves. The rest of the Lent,
they live pretty Temporately, and some of the most
Devout will not eat Fish all that time, unless it be on
<HI>Sundays:</HI> But as they are very exact in observing
these strict Rules in <HI>Lent,</HI> so it is a very difficult task
to perswade them to eat Fish on <HI>Sundays</HI> or <HI>Holy Days</HI>
out of <HI>Lent,</HI> being of Opinion, that the Rules pre∣scribed
by St. <HI>Clement,</HI> in the Tomes of the Coun∣cels
Printed at <HI>Venice,</HI> according to which, Laymen
that Fast on <HI>Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sundays,</HI> ought to be Ex∣communicated,
are most consonant to the Apostoli∣cal
Institution. By the same Rule that forbids them
to eat Flesh, they are also enjoyned not to meddle
with Women on their Fast-days, and during their
<HI>Lent;</HI> if the <HI>Russians</HI> should send abroad any Missio∣naries,
I am apt to believe they would make but ve∣ry
few Proselites in these parts. There are some who
alledge, that these frequent Feasts have been Esta∣blish'd
in <HI>Moscovy,</HI> rather upon a Political than Spi∣ritual
account, to wit, for the preservation of their
Cattle; forasmuch as the Peasants, being all Slaves
here, dont take the same care for the propagating
and preserving their Cattle, as they do in other parts,
where they enjoy the Fruits of their own labour;
and that the long Winters in <HI>Muscovy</HI> renders the
keeping of the Cattle both very troublesome and
<PB N="311" REF="114"/>
chargeable, whereas they abound in the best Fish in
the World, which are sold at a very cheap rate all
over <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>All those that are arrived to the Age of Discretion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Con∣fession.</NOTE>
are obliged to go to Confesssion, before they receive
the Communion. Their Confession they make
standing before one of their Images, on which having
fastned their Eyes, they make a particular recital of
all their Sins, expressing their Sorrow for every one
of them in particular, and promising Amend∣ment▪
The Priest very rarely gives them the Abso∣lution
without some Penance, which consist for the
most part, in repeating frequently the <HI>Gospodi Pomi∣lui,</HI>
or <HI>Lord have Mercy on me;</HI> in making a certain
number of Reverences before their Saints, in stand∣ing
at the Church-door, in abstaining from Wo∣men
and <HI>Aqua-Vita.</HI> But if it be a sin that requires
more than ordinary expiation, the Priest is not un∣mindful
of his own Interest; for, in this case, he en∣joyns
them to make use of the Holy Water, which
is Consecrated on <HI>Twelfth-Day▪</HI> to cleanse Sinners of
their Sins, and is disposed of for that purpose by the
Priests, not without a good Consideration.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> receive the Communion
upon <HI>Easter</HI> Eve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com∣munion.</NOTE> or at least upon a Fasting Day;
forasmuch as if they should Communicate on a <HI>Sun∣day,</HI>
they must not eat Flesh that day. They pre∣pare
themselves for it, by an extraordinary Mortifi∣cation
a Week before, when they eat nothing but
hard Bread, and drink nothing but <HI>Quus,</HI> worse
than our small Bear, or Water. They Communi∣cate
in both kinds, unless it be Children under se∣ven
years old, at which Age, as soon as they are ar∣rived,
they are admitted to Communicate both, be∣cause
at that Age (as they say) they begin to sin
mortally. They mix warm Water with Wine,
which (according to the Counsel of <HI>Constantinople)</HI>
represents the Water that came forth with the Blood
from the side of our Saviour; the Bread, which must
be Leavened and Baked by a Priest's Widow, they
put in the Wine, taking out a Morsal, together with
<PB N="312" REF="115"/>
some of the Wine in a Spoon. The Communion
Bread for sick Persons is about twice as big, and
somewhat thicker than a Crown Piece, and hath
in the middle the sign of the Crucifix. This figure
(after it is Consecrated) the Priest takes off with
an Instrument, not unlike a Launcet, and puts it up
in a wooden Box, hanging above the Altar, to pre∣serve
it from Rats and Mice. If a sick Person is to
receive the Communion, they take a little of it, up∣on
which they put a few drops of Red Wine, and a
little Water in the Chalice, which they give to the
sick Person with a Spoon; if the sick Person be not
capable of swallowing the Bread, they give him only
a little Wine. In the ordinary Administration of
the Sacrament, they make use of the same sort of
consecrated Bread, but not bigger than half a Crown,
from which they also take the Crucifix, and break it
into as many pieces, as there are Communicants,
which they cast into Red Wine, and mix it with a
little warm Water, and so Administer with a Spoon:
What remains of the Bread, after Consecration, is
called <HI>Kutja,</HI> or Holy Bread, of which the Priest
gives a Morsel to each of those, who have Com∣municated
the Week before. At the Administring
of the Sacrament, the Priest says these Words:
<HI>This is the true Body, and the true Blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ, which hath been given for thee, and for
many more, for the remission of thy sins, which thou
shalt take in remembrance of him, God bless thee:</HI> There
have been some who from these Words have drawn
this inference, as if the <HI>Muscovites</HI> believed Tran∣substantiation,
against which several pregnant rea∣sons
may be alledged to the contrary. For, if you
Discourse the <HI>Muscovites</HI> concerning the Consequen∣ces
of that belief, they will not refuse to own it ir∣rational,
nay, absur'd and ridiculous, neither do
they call to their aid (as the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> do)
God's Omnipotency. Besides that they dont pay
Adoration to this Mystery, which doubtless they
would do in a Religion so Zealous and Superstitious
as theirs, were they of the same Opinion, as to this
<PB N="313" REF="115"/>
point, with▪ the <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> Sick Children,
though never so Young, receive the Communion,
but in one kind, till they are seven Years Old, when
they Communicate like the rest, as we have obser∣ved
before. They do not refuse the Communion to
Madmen, but they only touch their Lips with the
Bread dip'd before in the Wine. A Woman in Child∣bed
is not to Communicate in the same Room, where
she was brought to Bed, but must be first washed and
carried into another place. Those that have com∣mitted
Murther, are not to be Communicated but
at the point of Death; if those that lie in extremity
are to be Communicated, they gave them first some
Water, or <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> wherein some relicks have
been put, then they receive the Communion, and at
the same time the Extream Unction; which done,
they are to take nothing else, nor any Nourishment,
unless there be very apparent Signs of their amend∣ment.
There are some among the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who
at the last extremity, cause themselves to be Shaven,
and become real Monks: This once done, they are
not permitted to take any thing for a Week after;
being perswaded that they are no more Men, but
become Angels: And if they happen, after these
Eight Days of Abstinence, to recover their Health,
they must go into a Monastery, because the Razor
has passed upon their Heads. Formerly they used
to send the Consecrated Bread to those Places in the
Country that were destitute of Priests: They used
also to give it to Travellers, to reserve it for a Case
of Necessity: But this Custom is now quite abolish∣ed
in <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical Government of <HI>Muscovy</HI> con∣sists
of a Patriarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hie∣rarchy.</NOTE> who resides in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI>
four Metropolitans, seven Archbishops, and one Bi∣shop;
besides the Arch-Deacons, Proto-Popes and
Priests. The four Metropolitans are those of▪</P>
<P><HI>Novogorodskoi</HI> and <HI>Welikoluskoi,</HI> who resides at <HI>No∣vogorod.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Rostoufskoi</HI> and <HI>Harostauskoi,</HI> who has his Resi∣dence
at <HI>Rosto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="116"/>
Of <HI>Casanskoi</HI> and <HI>Sunatskoi,</HI> at <HI>Casan.</HI></P>
<P>And that of <HI>Sarskoi</HI> and <HI>Pondoskoi,</HI> who lives with∣in
the Castle at <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>The seven Archbishops are those of▪</P>
<P><HI>Wologdskoi</HI> and <HI>Weliko Premskoi,</HI> who has his Seat
at <HI>Wologda.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Resanskoi</HI> and <HI>Moromskoi,</HI> who lives at <HI>Resan.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Susdalskoi</HI> and <HI>Turruskoi,</HI> who has his Residence
at <HI>Susdal.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Twerskoi</HI> and <HI>Cassinskoi,</HI> at <HI>Twere.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Sibirskoi</HI> and <HI>Tobolskoi,</HI> at <HI>Toboleska.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Astrachanschoi</HI> and <HI>Terskoi,</HI> who resides at <HI>Astra∣chan.</HI></P>
<P>Of <HI>Pleskouskoi</HI> and <HI>Sborskoi,</HI> who lives at <HI>Pleskou.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one Bishop in all <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to wit,
that of <HI>Comenskoi</HI> and <HI>Cassieskoi,</HI> who keeps his Re∣sidence
in the City of <HI>Columna.</HI></P>
<P>The Patriarch hath always about him an Arch-Deacon,
who is, as it were, his Vicar-General: He
hath also a Proto-Deacon, residing in the Castle of
<HI>Sabor.</HI> The rest of the Ecclesiastical Order are di∣stinguished
into <HI>Proto-Popes</HI> and <HI>Popes,</HI> or Priests.
Those that attend at Church, toll the Bells, and do
other inferiour Offices, are called <HI>Pangamari.</HI> The
Patriarch of <HI>Muscovy</HI> has the same (if not a greater▪)
Authority, as the Pope has in the <HI>Latin</HI> Church; for
he, in a manner, divides the Sovereignty with the
Great Duke. He is the Supream Head and Judge of
all Ecclesiastical Affairs: And such is his Power in all
Matters that have any Relation to their Religion,
that he reforms whatever he thinks prejudicial to this
Religion, or good Manners, without giving an Ac∣count
of it to their Great Duke: Yet not so, but that
his Orders must be put in Execution by the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Commands. The Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople</HI> had
heretofore the Nomination of the Patriarch of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
till in process of Time he had only the Confir∣mation;
and in this Age he hath lost both: At pre∣sent,
the Patriarch of <HI>Muscovy</HI> is chosen by the Great
Duke and the other Prelates: The Latter meet in
the great Church within the Castle, called <HI>Sabor;</HI>
<PB N="315" REF="116"/>
where having nominated two or three Prelates, the
most eminent for Learning, and other good Quali∣lities,
they present them to the Great Duke, who,
after a Conference with these Prelates, proceeds
jointly with them, to an Election. If it happen that
those proposed for the Election are equally eminent
for their Learning and Piety, it is, with the Grand
Duke's Approbation, sometimes decided by Lot.</P>
<P>The Patriarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pre∣lates mar∣ry not.</NOTE> Metropolitans, Archbishops, and
the Bishop, in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> are not to marry, but make
a Vow of Chastity as long as they continue in that
Dignity: For, the Prelates, as well as the Priests,
are allowed here to quit their Orders whenever they
think it convenient, They must not wear Rings on
their Fingers. They wear neither Drawers nor Shirts
of Linen Cloth, but of Flannel: Neither do they
make use of Beds.</P>
<P>The ordinary Habit of the Patriarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ha∣bits.</NOTE> Metropoli∣tans,
Archbishops, Bishop, and even of their Monks,
is very near the same: They wear a black Cassock;
and over that, an upper Garment of the same Co∣lour,
not much different from that worn by the other
<HI>Muscovites:</HI> Their Hoods are at least an Ell and an
half Diameter, having in the midst a round Piece, as
big as a Trencher, which hangs on the hinder part
of the Head: They wear in their Hands a Staff,
forked at the End, when they go abroad, which they
call <HI>Posock,</HI> and serves them for a Crosier.</P>
<P>There being in the City of <HI>Musco</HI> above 2000
Churches and Chapels, the first of which have at
least three or four, and some more, Priests belong∣ing
to them, it is no difficult Matter to guess what a
vast Number of Priests and Ecclesiasticks there must
be in that City. Those that are desirous to enter in∣to
Holy Orders, make their Addresses either to the
Patriarch, or any one of the Metropolitans; the
first, the best; where having been examined con∣cerning
their Qualifications, which consist only in
Reading and Writing, and to be able to sing in the
Church, they are admitted into Orders, with an At∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>station
of their being received into Priestood. At
<PB N="316" REF="117"/>
their Consecration they are invested with the Priest∣ly
Habit, as we have just now described it: They
have also the Hair cut off from the Crown of their
Heads, on which is put a little Cap, or <HI>Calotte,</HI>
which is the main Character of their Priesthood; the
which they never move, or take off, neither at
Church, or any where else, unless it be when they
have their Hair cut. The chief Respect the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
pay to the Priest, he is beholden for to his <HI>Ca∣lotte;</HI>
and good Reason why; for if, upon any Con∣test,
or Quarrel, this <HI>Calotte</HI> should be pulled off his
Head, upon the Ground, the adverse Party would
incurr the Penalty of the Mulct, called <HI>Bicestie,</HI> which
we have mentioned before: To prevent which, the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> when they are going to fight with a
Priest, first reverendly take off his <HI>Calotte;</HI> which,
after they have soundly cudgell'd or beaten him,
they put on again with a great deal of Respect:
Which done, they are not liable to any farther Pu∣nishment,
than if they had kick'd or cuffed a Lay-Man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Proto-Popes</HI> and <HI>Popes,</HI> or <HI>Temple-Priests,</HI> are
not only allowed, but obliged to marry once; but
cannot the second or third time, unless they quit
their Priesthood. This Point of the Marriages of
Priests is one of the main Points wherein they differ
as well from the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, as the <HI>Roman:</HI> For
which they alledge the Text of St. <HI>Paul, 1 Tim.</HI> 3.
that <HI>a Bishop should be the Husband of one Wife.</HI> And
for the Confirmation of it, they alledge the Fourth
Cannon of the Council which was held at <HI>Gangres,</HI> in
<HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> not long after that of <HI>Nice;</HI> where all
those are Anathematized who refuse to take the Com∣munion
from the Hands of a Married Priest. The
<HI>Muscovites</HI> are so strict in the Observance of this Opi∣nion,
that their Priests must be in a State of Mar∣riage
before they are admitted into Orders: Which
makes those that intend to embrace that kind of Life
marry very young, that they may the sooner have an
Opportunity of getting a Living. They are, besides
this, to marry a Maid, and no Widow, nor a Wo∣man
<PB N="317" REF="117"/>
the least blemished in her Reputation: And in
this Point they are to be so circumspect, that if the
Priest, the first Night after Marriage, finds that the
Lock has been opened before, by any other Key than
his own, he must either be divorced from her, or lay
down his <HI>Calotte;</HI> out of which two, you may be
sure he chuses the first. But if the Parson's Wife
stands her Trial fairly the first Night, she has, how∣ever,
this Comfort before the rest of the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Women, that she is not likely to be kept under so
severe an House-Discipline as the rest, for as much as
the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Priests hang, in a great measure, by
the Apron-string, they being, after they once become
Widowers, not suffered to administer the Sacrament,
or to assist at Noon-Service, when the Communion
is received, or to give their Benedictions to Marria∣ges;
but only at the Morning and Evening-Services.
But to counter-ballance this Advantage the Parson's
Wife has before others, the Priest is under a most
strict Obligation, that when-ever he has given his
Wife due Benevolence, he must not approach the
Altar all the next Day; so that, what with this, and
the great Number of Fasts, she is likely to live upon
very slender Diet, unless the Parson be so good-na∣ture
as sometimes to prefer the Duty to his Wife,
before that in the Church, and substitute one to offi∣ciate
in his Room at the Altar. The Priests, how∣ever,
have this Comfort left them after the Death of
their Wives, that if they do not approve of a single
Life, they are free to lay down their Cassock and <HI>Ca∣lotte,</HI>
and turn Merchants, Tradesmen, or any thing
else they can, and so marry again. If they are too
old to undergo the Fatigues of the Sacerdotal Fun∣ction,
or of Marriage, the last Remedy is a Mona∣stery,
where they end their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>There is a great Number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Monasteries all over
<HI>Muscovy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nasteries.</NOTE> both for Men and Women, both in Cities,
and up and down the Country; especially, all along
the Rivers <HI>Mosca</HI> and <HI>Oeca,</HI> the most fertile Part of all
<HI>Muscovy.</HI> Besides the <HI>Anchorets,</HI> who build their Cha∣pels
upon the High-ways, and live in Woods, like
<PB N="318" REF="118"/>
<HI>Hermites,</HI> subsisting only by the Alms they receive
from Travellers; the rest follow the Rule of Great
St. <HI>Basil.</HI></P>
<P>They eat no Flesh, nor Fresh Fish; neither drink
they any Wine, <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> or <HI>Hydromel:</HI> They live
only on Salt Fish, Honey, Milk, Cheese, Herbs and
Pulse: Cucumbers, both Fresh, and Pickled, are
their chiefest Dainties; these they mince very small,
and eat them with a Spoon, in some of their Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
or Small <HI>Hydromels.</HI> But if they live in great Au∣sterity
in their Monasteries, when-ever they go a∣broad,
(which they are allowed to do,) both Men▪
and Women are very forward in dispensing with the
Severity of their Statutes; for they seldom refuse any
thing that is offered them; and will refresh themselves
with Strong Liquor to that Degree, that it is unsafe
for them to go home without good Company.
Here-tofore Superstition had got so far the Ascendant
over the Religious <HI>Muscovites,</HI> that here, as well as
in some other Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> they used to make
over all that they had, for the Benefit of the Mona∣steries:
So that, if a Stop had not been put to these
Extravagancies, they would, in Time, have got into
the Possession of the best part of this vast Empire.
But those that now embrace the Monastick Life, are
only allowed to carry a certain Part of their Estates
with them, into the Monastery; being obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
leave the rest to their Heirs. They do not live so
retired in them, but that they appear in great Num∣bers,
both in the Cities, and all over the Country,
where they frequently follow the same Employments
with the Peasants; some of them also Trading in
Malt, Hops, all sorts of Corn, and Cattel. Pover∣ty,
Old Age, Infirmities and Domestick Contests
being the chief Inducements of those that embrace
this Life, the fewest chusing it out of a Motive of
Devotion, it is no Wonder if they, most of them,
according to the general Education of the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI>
can scarce read or write: Not One in Ten▪
that can say the <HI>Lord's Prayer:</HI> And those amongst
them that are acquainted with the <HI>Creed</HI> and the <HI>Ten
<PB N="319" REF="118"/>
Commandments,</HI> are looked upon as Men of extraor∣dinary
Learning. I cannot forbear to relate, upon
this Occasion, a certain merry Passage, which hap∣pen'd
some Years ago, in the Monastery of <HI>Rostone,</HI>
for as much as it is not only very diverting, but also
may serve as a convincing Instance of the Simplicity
and Ignorance of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Monks: The above∣mentioned
Monastery stands upon a Lake, where,
for some time, a Fish had been seen of an extraordi∣nary
Magnitude, to the great Astonishment of the
Monks. This Fish, in a Sun-shiny Day, would of∣ten
be playing, and appearing half above Water;
so that an Eagle, one time, swooping at it, and be∣ing
over-eager of his Prey, struck his Talons into
the Flesh of the Fish with such Violence, that he
could not pull them out again. The Fish being
willing to be rid of his Enemy, plunged him in to
the Bottom; so that being transiated into a much
grosser Element than he was used to live in before,
he soon lost his Life, though his Talons still stuck
fast in the Flesh. The Fish, very impatient of his
Burthen, made frequently towards the Shoar of the
Lake; where being perceived by the Friars, with
Feathers upon his Back, they were all put under
such a Consternation, that not one of them had the
Courage to approach it; some believing it to be an
Apparition; others, a Sea-Monster; and some con∣cluding
it could be no less than a Water-Devil: The
last Opinion, it seems, was the most prevailing; so
that, to banish the Devil from that Shoar, they fell
to Ringing of Bells: And when they found this to
prove ineffectual, they went all in Procession, arm∣ed
at all Points with such Instruments and Weapons
as are commonly made use of upon such Occasions;
but all in vain, the Monster, or Devil, as it seems,
not being afraid of their Weapons: So that all there∣abouts,
nothing was to be heard of, but the dread∣ful
<HI>Leviathan,</HI> which had scared the poor Monks al∣most
out of their Senses. One Mr. <HI>Roger Eaton,</HI> an
<HI>English</HI> Merchant, then living in <HI>Russia,</HI> coming by
chance that way, had immediately a full Relation given
<PB N="320" REF="119"/>
him of the Monster; so that being curious to see,
he went to the Shoar, where he found a great Num∣ber
of People standing some distance off. He soon
perceiving what it was that had put them into such
a Fright, told them, that he would soon deliver
them from this Monster, provided they could get
some Body that would row the Boat. But it was no
easie matter to perswade any one of them all to be
so bold, as to approach so near the Devil; till a cer∣tain
Fellow, being made more couragious than the
rest by good store of <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> at last undertook
the Task. As they were going off from the Shoar,
to encounter the Monster, the Spectators, looking
upon the Attempt no less dangerous, than when
St. <HI>George</HI> fought▪ the Dragon, gave them over for
lost, expecting every Moment to see them devoured
by this Water-Dragon: But they were agreeably
surprized when they perceived the terrible <HI>Levia∣than</HI>
slain by his Conqueror. In short, Mr. <HI>Eaton</HI>
shot and killed the Beast with a Screw'd Gun;
which, when taken up, proved to be nothing else
than a very large Pike, of about five Foot long, and
of the Thickness of a Man. It is easily to be ima∣gined,
that their Fear soon turned into Shame; yet,
to hide their Blushes, and to make some Amends to
their Champion, they drunk together so heartily,
till they became all mellow; and so put a merry
Epilogue to the Play.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>White,</HI> another <HI>English</HI> Merchant, living in
<HI>Russia,</HI> did not meet with the same Entertainment
from the Fraternity; For, having been one time invi∣ted
by them to Dinner, they had caught another Pike,
not quite so big as the former; and as the Cook was
cutting it open, he found a new-born Infant in the
Belly of it; which put the Monks into so ill an Hu∣mour,
that the <HI>English</HI> Gentleman was fain to re∣turn
home without his Dinner. This Infant was
suspected to have been thrown into the Lake by one
of the Nuns of a Nunnery hard by this Monastery;
it being the Custom in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to build always a
Convent and Nunnery near to one another.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="119"/>
The Gentleman to whom we are beholden for
these two Relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Col∣lins.</NOTE> and who has, for a considerable
time, been resident in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> having given an∣other
Instance of the Ignorance and Superstition of
their Priests, no less pleasant than the former, it will
not be amiss to insert it here. It seems the <HI>English</HI>
Resident in the City of <HI>Muscow</HI> had a very fine Mon∣key,
famous amongst the <HI>Russians</HI> there, for his ma∣ny
Tricks and Pranks which he would be playing in
the Market. This Monkey, one Day, got into one
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Churches, hard by the <HI>English</HI> Re∣sident's
House, and tumbled down some of their
Saints. The Priest coming soon after into the
Church, and seeing his Gods thus handled, stood
amazed; but having recovered himself a little, and
set their Saintships in their respective Places, he
dashed all the Windows and Doors with Holy-Wa∣ter,
to keep the Devil out of the Church. But Pug
not understanding his Exorcisms, took his Opportu∣nity
one Morning, when the Priest was going to per∣form
the Morning-Service, to be in the Church as
soon as he; where he begun the old Game of ruf∣fling
and pulling about the Saints, not sparing even
St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> himself; and that with so much Eager∣ness,
as if he had been bred a Quaker, grinning now
and then in the Priest's Face; who, after he had re∣covered
himself out of his first Fright, at last ap∣proached,
with his Cross before him; and having
no other Way left, he betakes himself to his Sove∣reign
Remedy; I mean, the Horse-Tail, dipped in
Holy-Water; wherewith he so besprinkled poor
Pug, (who hated it as bad as the Devil himself,)
that he made the best of his Way home to the <HI>English</HI>
Resident's House. No sooner was the Morning-Ser∣vice
over, but the <HI>Pope</HI> (or Priest) made most bitter
Complaints against a certain Stranger, living in the
<HI>English</HI> House, for having thrown down his Saints,
and prophaned the Holy Place. Whereupon, he
obtained an Order to search the Resident's Lodgings:
And all his Retinue were brought forth, in the Pre∣sence
of the Priest; but none of them being the Per∣son
<PB N="322" REF="120"/>
he looked for, <HI>It was,</HI> says he, <HI>a little Nincheen,</HI>
(or Stranger.) Whereupon, the young Children
being brought out, the Monkey, by chance, came
jumping out with them: <HI>Hold, hold,</HI> said the Priest,
with a great deal of Joy, <HI>this is the little Stranger:
Seize him, seize him.</HI> Which being done according∣ly,
poor Pug was had before his Betters; where not
being able to answer for himself, he was condemned
to the Strappado, and paid for his unseasonable Re∣formation,
with his Life.</P>
<P>But, after all this merry Digression, it is time to
return to more serious Matters: It is to be observed,
that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> retain to this Day some Remnants
of the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Law; For, though they do not ab∣hor
Swine's Flesh, yet they will not touch a Squir∣rel,
Coney, or Hare. But, which is the oddest of
all, They hold it <HI>Pagan,</HI> or <HI>Vnclean,</HI> to eat Veal;
but not Lamb: For what Reason, neither they, nor
any body else, know. They account it next to a
Sin, to omit <HI>Lotionem post inatum.</HI> They look upon
it as a great Sin, for a <HI>Muscovite</HI> to lie with a Wo∣man
that is not of the same Communion: But a Ve∣nial
Trespass, for a <HI>Russian</HI> Woman to accept of a
Kindness from a Stranger: They give for a Reason,
Because her Issue will be educated in the True <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
Faith; whereas a <HI>Muscovite</HI> Man may happen to
beget a Child upon a Stranger, which is not likely
to be educated in the same Religion. Heresie is pu∣nished,
among the <HI>Russians,</HI> with Fire: The Here∣tick
is carried to the Top of a low House, from
whence he jumps into the Fire made underneath;
and immediately they throw Straw upon him, and
good store of dry Splinters of Firr-Wood; these be∣ing
fired, they soon suffocate the Malefactor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Brief History of the Succession of the Rus∣sian
Great Dukes from their first Origin,
till the Death of that famous Tyrant, John
Basilovitz.</HEAD>
<P>THE first Origin of this Empire is very abscure;
for, the Great Dukes of <HI>Muscovy</HI> derive their
Pedigree from <HI>August<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Caesar,</HI> yet if it be consider∣ed,
how confused the Atchievements and Successi∣ons,
of these Ancient Princes are among an ignorant
People, it is no difficult matter to imagine, that
their Ancient History must be full of uncertainty.
Thus much is certain, that this vast Empire was in
former Ages divided into a great many Principalities,
under their own Laws and Princes, which in after
Ages, and by several Degrees, have been united
under one Head, and compose that vast Body,
which now adays is known under the name of the
<HI>Russians</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But to return to their Chronicles, they relate that
<HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> among others of his Kindred, whom
he sent to be Governour over very remote Provinces.
One <HI>Prussus</HI> had assigned him <HI>Prussia,</HI> had his Seat
on the <HI>Eastern Baltick</HI> Shoar by the River <HI>Weixel.</HI>
Of him were descended by the fourth Generation,
<HI>Rureck, Sinaus</HI> and <HI>Truvor,</HI> who, at the perswasion
of one <HI>Gostomistius,</HI> a rich Citizen of <HI>Novogorod,</HI> were
sent for by the <HI>Russians,</HI> who at that time lived with∣out
any Civil Government, to rule over them in the
Year 1573. As they went into <HI>Russia,</HI> they took a
long with them <HI>Olechus,</HI> their near Kinsman, and
so having divided the whole Country among them∣selves,
each in his Province laid the first foundation
of a regular Civil Government.</P>
<P><HI>Iverson</HI> the Son of <HI>Rureck</HI> (the rest dying without
Issue) became Successor to them all: He took to
<PB N="324" REF="121"/>
Wife one <HI>Otha,</HI> the Daughter of a Citizen of <HI>Plesscon,</HI>
by whom he begot <HI>Stoslaus,</HI> but being after that Slain
by his Enemies, his Wife <HI>Otha</HI> went to <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI>
where she was Baptized and Named <HI>Helen.</HI></P>
<P>His Son <HI>Stoslaus</HI> was a Warlike Prince, and very
Victorious in several Battles, till at last being Slain
by his Enemies, they made a Cup of his Skull, En∣graven'd
with this Sentence; <HI>Seeking after other Men's
lives, he has lost his own.</HI> He left three Sons <HI>Teropol∣chus,
Olega</HI> and <HI>Volodimir.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Volodimir</HI> having slain his two Elder Brothers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Volodi∣mir I.</NOTE> made
himself master of all <HI>Russia;</HI> he married afterwards
<HI>Anne,</HI> the Sister of <HI>Basitius Porphyrogenites,</HI> and in the
Year 989, introduced the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion among
the <HI>Russians,</HI> himself being before instructed in it,
and Baptized in the Year 988. Some among whom
is <HI>Zonara</HI>'s report, that it was done by a Miracle, of
which we have spoke before. He built the City of
<HI>Volodimir,</HI> the Capital of the Province of the same
Name, upon the River <HI>Cesma,</HI> which was for a
considerable time after the Residence of the Great
Dukes.</P>
<P><HI>Volodimir</HI> left behind him Eleven Sons, among
whom he divided the Dukedom: <HI>Beristus</HI> and <HI>Gle∣bus</HI>
forsook the World, and for their Holy Life were
Canon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed after their Death; their Feast is kept by
the <HI>Russians</HI> in <HI>November:</HI> The rest falling, into con∣tentio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
among themselves, every one being ambi∣tious
of making himself the sole and supream Lord of
all <HI>Russia,</HI> they ruined one another, till <HI>Jaroslaus</HI>
was left the only inheritor of all their Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>Volodimir,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Volodi∣mir II.</NOTE> the Son of this <HI>Jaroslaus,</HI> used to keep
his Residence in the City of <HI>Kiovia,</HI> upon the River
<HI>Boristhenis:</HI> He was grown very famous for the ma∣ny
conflicts he had with the Sons of his Uncles, whom
having at last subdued, he was call'd <HI>Mono Machus.</HI>
He was also very Victorious against <HI>Constantine</HI> the
<HI>Greek</HI> Emperor, and having over-run all <HI>Thracia,</HI> re∣turned
home loaden with Honour, and a prodigious
Booty; whilst he was preparing to renew the War
with more Vigour against the Emperor, he sent to
<PB N="325" REF="121"/>
him <HI>Neuphytus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and <HI>Eustathius</HI> Ab∣bot
of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who having among other rich Gifts,
presented him, with part of our Saviour's Cross, and
saluted him by the Name of <HI>Czar,</HI> perswaded him to
enter into a League with <HI>Constantine,</HI> with whom
ever after he cultivated a very good Correspon∣dance.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his Son <HI>Vuzevolodus,</HI> after
whom in order of descent, Reigned <HI>George</HI> and <HI>De∣metrius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>George</HI> Succeeded his Father <HI>Demetrius;</HI> he fought
with very ill success against <HI>Bathy</HI> the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Prince,
by whom he was slain in the Battle in the Year
1237, and the <HI>Russians</HI> brought under the subjection
of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who made their Dukes dependent
from them, and as a token of their subjection, forced
them too often as the <HI>Tartarian.</HI> Ambassadors should
come into <HI>Russia,</HI> to go out and to meet them, and
to stand bare headed in their own Courts, while the
Ambassadors delivered their message sitting. About
the same time, the <HI>Tartars</HI> having ravaged <HI>Poland,
Plesia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> IV. obtained a
Peace, or rather a Truce, from them for five Years;
the <HI>Russians</HI> affirm, that this <HI>Bathy</HI> was the Father of
<HI>Tamerain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>George</HI> was succeded by his Brother <HI>Jaroslaus,</HI> and
after him Reign'd his Son <HI>Alexander.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Daniel</HI> the Son of <HI>Alexander,</HI> was the first that trans∣lated
the Seat of the Great Dukes to the City of
<HI>Musco,</HI> and laid the first Foundation of the Castle; he
was also the first that took upon him the Title of
Great Duke.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> the Son of <HI>Daniel,</HI> was sirnamed <HI>Kalota,</HI> which
signifies a Scrip, which he always carried about him,
and out of it he used to give Alms to the Poor.</P>
<P>His Son <HI>Simeon</HI> died without Issue, and left the
Dukedom to <HI>John</HI> his next Brother.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> succeeded his Father <HI>John,</HI> and left two
Sons, <HI>Basilias</HI> and <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Basili,</HI> the Eldest Brother, Reigned after his Fa∣ther's
Death, and had a Son of his own Name, but
<PB N="326" REF="122"/>
having conceived a jealousie against his Wife, he
disinherits the Son, declaring, <HI>George</HI> his Brother, his
Successor in his Dominions.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> being thus gotten into Possession of <HI>Russia,</HI>
puts his Nephew <HI>Basili</HI> in Prison, but at his Death,
(though he had two Sons of his own) resigned the
whole Dukedom to the hands of the same <HI>Basili:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Basili</HI> being thus unexpectedly put into his suppo∣sed
right, was soon attack'd by <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
the two Sons of <HI>George,</HI> who could not brook
the injury received by their Father's last Will, and
having surprised him, they put out his Eyes, think∣ing
thereby to render him incapable of entertaining
any further hopes of administring the Government,
but they were mistaken in their Aim; for, the <HI>Bo∣jares</HI>
and Nobles, notwithstanding his Blindness, kept
stedfast to their Allegiance to the Great Duke, who
was therefore Sir-named <HI>Cziemnok,</HI> or <HI>the blind
Duke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Basilovits,</HI> who began his Reign in the Year
1450,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John Ba∣silovits.</NOTE> succeeded his Father <HI>Basili,</HI> he was the first
that brought the <HI>Russian</HI> Name out of Obscurity into
Renown. For, after having secured himself at home,
by putting to Death all such of his Kindred, as were
likely to contend with him for the Superiority, he
applied all his thoughts to make himself formidable
to his Neighbours. Among them he bent his whole
Force against the City and Dukedom of <HI>Novogor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
Veliki,</HI> with whom he was engaged in a War for Se∣ven
Years, till at last in the Year 1477. having van∣quish'd
them in a Battle, he forced that Great and
Rich City to a Submission, and to receive a <HI>Russian</HI>
Governour. But afterwards thinking himself not
absolute Master of the City, and being unwilling to
run the hazard of compelling them by force, he went
thither in Person, under pretence of some Religious
concerns in behalf of the <HI>Greek</HI> Religion; so that be∣ing
admitted into the City by the Authority of the
Archbishop <HI>Theophilus,</HI> he ransact it and carried away
an incredible Booty to <HI>Musco,</HI> with most of the In∣habitants,
and sent <HI>Muscovites</HI> thither in their place.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="122"/>
Having subdued this Potent Dukedom, as also those
of <HI>Tyversky</HI> and <HI>Plescou,</HI> and several other petty Prin∣cipalities
bordering upon his Dominions; he was the
first that united <HI>Russia</HI> into one considerable Body,
and consequently laid the first Foundation of its fu∣ture
Greatness. He entred into a War with the <HI>Li∣vonians,</HI>
for no other cause than to enlarge his bounds,
and advanced as far as the River <HI>Narva,</HI> where he
built the strong Castle of <HI>Ivanogorod,</HI> upon a steepy
Rock opposite to the City of <HI>Narva,</HI> which lies on
the other side of that River; but having received a
Signal, overthrew in a Battle fought against <HI>Guallies
de Pletenbergh,</HI> the Master of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order of
Knights, he was forced to make a Truce with them
for Fifty Years. He had also some differences with
<HI>Alexander,</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who having married his
Daughter, had, as he pretended, forced her to a∣bandon
the <HI>Greek</HI> Religion, and to turn <HI>Roman Ca∣tholick,</HI>
which breaking out at last into a War, was
carried on for some time with no great advantage on
either side; nevertheless the <HI>Basilovits</HI> took <HI>Plescou</HI> in
the Fray from the <HI>Luthianians.</HI> His Wife was the
Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Tiversky,</HI> of her he begat
<HI>John,</HI> unto whom, after he had Married him to the
Daughter of <HI>Stephen,</HI> Prince of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> he resign'd
the whole Dukedom: But <HI>John</HI> dying soon after,
left only one Son, who was called <HI>Demetrius: Basi∣lovits</HI>
by reason of the tender Age of his Grandchild,
was obliged to reassume the Administration of the
Government, and soon after Married a second Wife,
to wit, <HI>Sophia,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Thomas Polvologus,</HI>
who is said to have receiv'd her Doury out of the
Pope's Treasury, under condition that she should
endeavour the Convertion of the Duke to the <HI>Romish</HI>
Faith. This Princess being of a very Haughty Tem∣per,
and not able to endure that her Husband should
be a Vassal to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> did so effectually encou∣rage
him to shake of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Yoak, that having
first dislodged the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Ambassadors, that had
their residence in the Castle of <HI>Musco,</HI> and were the
Duke's Overseers in State Affairs, afterwards by de∣grees
<PB N="328" REF="123"/>
dispossess'd them of all they held in <HI>Russia.</HI> By
the perswasion of this Princess, he transferred the
Dukedom from <HI>Demetrius,</HI> his Grandchild, the Son
of <HI>John,</HI> deceased, to <HI>Gabriel</HI> his Eldest Son by this
Princess.</P>
<P><HI>Gabriel</HI> was no sooner Great Duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Basili Iva∣novits.</NOTE> but he chang∣ed
his Name, and assum'd that of <HI>Basili Ivanowitz;</HI>
he, after the example of his Father, applied all his
care to enlarge his Territories, which he did with
good success against the <HI>Lithuanians</HI> and <HI>Polanders,</HI>
from whom he recovered great part of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> e∣specially
the City of <HI>Smoleusko,</HI> on the River <HI>Bori∣sthenes</HI>
or <HI>Nieper</HI> in the Year, 1514. He also eject∣ed
the Duke of <HI>Siberi</HI> or <HI>Severia,</HI> and united the Pro∣vince
to his Crown; he afterwards turned his Arms
against the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Casan,</HI> whom he defeated in a
memorable Battle, and made them his Vassals. But
the <HI>Tartars</HI> having soon after killed their Governour,
surprised him with a considerable Army, and having
forced him to retreat with such Forces, as he could
get together in hast, under <HI>Novogorod</HI> on the River
<HI>Occas,</HI> they took and plundred the City of <HI>Musco,</HI>
and forc'd the Castle to a shameful Capitulation, by
vertue of which the Great Dukes were to be tribu∣taries
to the <HI>Tartars.</HI> But the <HI>Tartars</HI> having soon af∣ter
broken the Capitulation by Besieging the City
of <HI>Rhesan,</HI> and the <HI>Weywode</HI> or <HI>Muscovite</HI> Governor,
having by a straitagem, got into his possession the
Great Duke's Original Letters Patents, whereby the
Conditions made with the Castle of <HI>Musco</HI> were con∣firmed,
(as has been related before in the Descripti∣on
of the City of <HI>Casan,)</HI> and having at the same time,
forced the <HI>Tartars</HI> to raise the Siege of the City and
Castle of <HI>Rhesan,</HI> both the People and Great Duke,
were so encouraged by the sudenness of so lucky an
accident, that the latter marched against the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
and Besieged the City of <HI>Casan,</HI> which he caused to
be attack'd with all the Vigour imaginable; but these
within being conscious of their guilt, Fought like
desperate Men, so that after<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much Bloodshed on
both sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the Great Duke was obliged to raise the
<PB N="329" REF="123"/>
Siege, and to leave the Conquest of this, as well as
other <HI>Tartarian</HI> Kingdoms on that side to his Son
<HI>John Basilovits,</HI> whom he begat of <HI>Helan,</HI> the Daugh∣ter
of <HI>Knez Glinsky,</HI> after having Divorced himself
from his first Wife.</P>
<P><HI>John Basilovits</HI> being but a Child,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John Ba∣silovits.</NOTE> succeeded his
Father, under the Tuition of <HI>George</HI> his Uncle, in the
Year 1540. But no sooner was he arrived to the
Age of Maturity, but he gave most evident proofs
of his future Greatness.</P>
<P>Being willing to make himself formidable to his
Neighbours, by some memorable exploit, at the be∣ginning
of his Reign, he resolved to revenge the af∣front
his Father had received before <HI>Casan,</HI> which
City he Besieged in the Year 1552,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Wars.</NOTE> And after he
had batter'd it very furiously for the space of two
Months, offered them very honourable conditions,
which they having refused to accept, he ordered the
general Assault to be given on the Second Day of
<HI>July</HI> in the same Year; and notwithstanding the re∣solute
Defence made by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> carried it by
Storm, and thereby became Master of the whole
Kingdom of <HI>Casan.</HI></P>
<P>About two Years after, he marched against the
<HI>Nagajan Tartars,</HI> bordering to the <HI>South</HI> upon those
of <HI>Casan;</HI> and having in the Year 1554, on the first
day of <HI>August</HI> taken by Assault <HI>Astra Chan,</HI> the Ca∣pital
of the Province, he also reduced that King∣dom
under his Subjection.</P>
<P>By what accident he got into the Possession of the
vast Country of <HI>Siberia,</HI> which has since proved one of
the most profitable to the Czars of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> by
which they have opened themselves a way into <HI>Chi∣na,</HI>
as has been related before in the Description of
that Province.</P>
<P>In the Year 1558. he turned his victorious Arms
again <HI>Livonia;</HI> where having ravaged the Bishoprick
of <HI>Derpt</HI> and <HI>Virland,</HI> he made himself Master of the
Cities of <HI>Narva,</HI> and of <HI>Toopator-Derpt:</HI> So that the
<HI>Livonians</HI> not being able alone to resist his Power,
and being put into Despair by the most horrid Cruel∣ties
<PB N="330" REF="124"/>
exercised upon them by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and espe∣cially
against <HI>Furstenbergh,</HI> the Master of their Or∣der,
they were forced to submit themselves, some
under the Protection of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the rest under the
Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> In the Year 1570▪ he sent a ve∣ry
numerous Army, under the Command of <HI>Maynus</HI>
Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> to besiege the City of <HI>Revel,</HI> in <HI>Li∣vonia;</HI>
but the City being assisted by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> un∣der
whose Protection they were, forced him to raise
the Siege: And when he attacked it a second time,
in the Year 1577, he met with no better Success:
And in the Year 1581, the <HI>Swedish</HI> General, <HI>Pontus
de la Guarde,</HI> recovered the City of <HI>Narva</HI> from the
<HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>He was at first also very successful against the <HI>Poles,</HI>
till <HI>Stephen Battori,</HI> Prince of <HI>Transylvania,</HI> and elect∣ed
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> not only recovered all the Places
he had taken from that Crown before, but also obli∣ged
him to make a Peace in the Year 1582; by vir∣tue
of which, he relinquished all his Pretensions to
that part of <HI>Livonia</HI> which had put it self under the
Protection of the King of <HI>Poland.</HI> In the Year 1571,
the <HI>Crim-Tartars</HI> also made a great Irruption into
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> destroying all with Fire and Sword; and
at last burnt the City of <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>As the first Years of his Reign were attended with
Victories abroad, so at home he ruled for some time
with a great deal of Mildness; and by the outward
Shew of his Piety, made his Subjects conceive all
the Hopes that could be of a prosperous Reign: For
he would go frequently to Church, say the Service
himself, sing, and never fail to be present at any Ec∣clesiastical
Ceremonies; nay, sometimes execute the
Functions of Monks and Priests himself: Which,
without Question, was it that mis-led <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI>
into that Mistake, when he calls him <HI>a good and de∣vout
Christian;</HI> For it will sufficiently appear, in
the Sequel of this History, that he abused both
God and Men; and that his pretended Piety was on∣ly
intended to gain the Popular Applause, (which he
both effected, and stood in need of,) and to cover
<PB N="331" REF="124"/>
his most horrid Designs against such of the Nobility
as he was afraid would not submit, without Relu∣ctancy,
to the Yoak he intended to put upon their
Necks. He began to give the first Proofs of his
cruel Disposition in the Year 1560; when having
acquired a vast Reputation, both at home and abroad,
by the great Success of his Arms against the <HI>Tartars,
Livonians</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> he thought this the most conve∣nient
Time to put in Execution his Design of ma∣king
himself the sole and absolute Master of this vast
Empire. His Grandfather had laid the first Founda∣tion
of this Maxim, (which was followed by his
Son <HI>Basili,</HI> the Father of <HI>John Basilovitz,)</HI> to wit,
To suppress the antient Nobility, by despoiling them
not only of their Castles, and Strong Holds, but also
of their Estates. But this Tyrant looking upon these
Means as insufficient, resolved, by putting to death
all the Great Men in the Kingdom whom he found,
in the least, contrary to his Design, to secure to him∣self
the Arbitrary Disposal of this great Empire.</P>
<P>He made the first Beginning with one <HI>Demetrius
Owezinovitz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Cruel∣ties.</NOTE> a Man of great Parts among the <HI>Rus∣sians:</HI>
Being therefore willing to be rid of him, he
invited him one Evening to Supper, with a great
deal of seeming Friendship; where they drunk very
merrily, so that <HI>Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trius</HI> began to be overcome by
the Strength of the Liquor; which the Tyrant per∣ceiving,
and believing this to be a fit Opportunity to
put his Design in Execution, he drank to him a great
Bowl-full of Strong <HI>Hydromel,</HI> which he obliged <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
to pledge, to his (the Great Duke's) Health;
but it being impossible for him to drink above half of
it, the Great Duke angrily told him, That since he
was so unmannerly as to refuse to drink his Health in
his Presence, he might get down into his Wine-Cel∣lar,
where he should drink it at his own Leisure.
<HI>Demetrius</HI> being very willing to obey, went, without
Reluctancy, down into the Cellar; where, by the
secret Orders of the Tyrant, he was suffocated.</P>
<P>In the same manner he caused to be either secretly
slain, or suffocated, several Persons of Eminent Quali∣ty,
<PB N="332" REF="125"/>
without any Body's daring to enquire into their
Death; till at last, the Patriarch, and the other Pre∣lates,
in Conjunction with some of the boldest among
the Nobility▪ having represented to him the Enormi∣ties
of his Actions, he seemed, for some small Time,
to have changed his cruel Sentiments into a more
mild Disposition.</P>
<P>The better to confirm them in this Opinion, he
got it spread abroad, that he intended to abdicate the
Empire, and to retire into a Monastery: And soon
after, having called together the Nobility, he told
them, That since he had two Sons, whom he in∣tented
to make his Successors, he would recommend
them to their Care: That he did not question but
they would not only pay them due Allegiance, but
also assist them with their Counsel, and good Ad∣vice:
That, for his part, he intended to build him∣self
a Monastery, near the City of <HI>Musco;</HI> where he
would be ready at hand to give his Directions in
Matters of any Moment. Having thus cajoll'd them
into a good Opinion, he caused a very large Build∣ing
to be erected, surrounded with a strong Wall▪
which he endowed with considerable Revenues, for
the Maintenance of such as were to abide with him
there, and to lead, as he pretended, a Monastick
Life; but, in effect, to serve as an Encouragement
to such as he intended to employ in the Execution of
his cruel Designs: For, after he had settled himself,
with his Gang, in this Castle, he used, under pre∣tence
of Preferment, to send such of his Nobles as
he intended to sacrifice to his Ambition, into some
distant Province or another, as Governors; whi∣ther,
after some Time, he would command some of
his Soldiers, under such Officers as were before-hand
engaged to execute his Orders, to the Place, where
the Fact was to be perpetrated under pretence of
changing the Garrison; where they remained till
they found a convenient Opportunity to send, by
one Means or another, the Governor into the other
World: Which done, his Kindred were sure to
meet with the same Fate at <HI>Musco;</HI> the Tyrant ne∣ver
<PB N="333" REF="125"/>
wanting Means to root out the Shrubs, after he
had fell'd the Tree; forasmuch as the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
who are above all other Nations given to caluminate
and draw one another into the Snare, were always
ready to furnish him with sufficient opportunity to
rid himself of those under some specious pretence or
another.</P>
<P>Thus he treated <HI>Knez Rostoroski,</HI> descended from
the antient Dukes of <HI>Roskovie,</HI> or <HI>Rosthovie;</HI> whom
he dreaded, for his Courage, and Skill in Martial
Affairs. This Principality, as well as those of <HI>Twere</HI>
and <HI>Bielski,</HI> were in former Ages allotted to the
Younger Brothers of the Dukes of <HI>Russia;</HI> but were
by <HI>Basili,</HI> the Father of <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> appropriated
to his own Use, leaving only to the Heirs a very mo∣derate
Share for their Maintenance. The last of the
Dukes of <HI>Kosthovie</HI> was <HI>Peter Rostowski,</HI> whom the
Tyrant had made <HI>Waywode</HI> or Governor of <HI>Nise No∣vogorod.</HI>
Having resolved his Ruin, he sent thither
40 Ruffians, whom he used to employ on such like
Occasions, with Orders to bring to him the Head of
the said Governor. These having found him at his
Devotion, they dragg'd him from thence; and ha∣ving
stripp'd him stark naked, and tied him in a
Sledge, they carried him streight-ways to the River
<HI>Colga;</HI> where he that commanded the Party, having
cut off his Head, threw the Body into the River.
His Kindred and Children (Fifty in Number) were
all murther'd by the Tyrant's Order; and For∣ty
of his Slaves condemned to perpetual Imprison∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>John Pietrovits,</HI> a Man of a very high Rank in <HI>Rus∣sia,</HI>
was fain to undergo the same Fate, with his
whole Family: For, having been falsly accused in
the Year 1568, as if he aimed at the Crown, the
Tyrant, without admitting them to be heard, seized
upon his Estate, both Real and Personal, which was
very great; and condemned him to go as a private
Soldier, in the War against the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Having not
so much left him, out of all his Estate, as an Horse
to ride upon; he was furnished with one by a cer∣tain
<PB N="334" REF="126"/>
Friar, who took pity of his Condition;so he
obeyed his Orders: And after having served several
Years as a single Volunteer, who used to have at his
Heels a great Number of Servants, he at last return∣ed
to <HI>Musco.</HI> The Tyrant not thinking it sufficient
to have humbled him thus, he called together, at a
certain Time; his Council of Nobles; where having
summoned <HI>Pietrovits</HI> to appear, he, with his own
Hands, as soon as they were all met, put the Ducal
Cap and Crown on his Head, with a Sceptre in his
Hand, and thus, attired in a very rich Robe, set him
upon a Throne, in the Presence of all the Court;
where having shewed him the same Revernce as is
usually paid to the Czars of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> he spoke thus
to him; <HI>All Hail to our Great Duke and Monarch of</HI>
Russia: <HI>Now thou hast obtained what thou so much desi∣redst;
now it is, thou hast encompassed thy Wish. I
knew thy Aim was, to supply my Place, in the Throne of</HI>
Muscovy: <HI>See how I have, my self, created thee Great
Duke of</HI> Russia, <HI>in a most solemn manner. But know▪
that as it was in my Power to set thee upon the Throne, so
I am able to dethrone and despoil thee of that Dignity, as
Pleasure.</HI> He had no sooner uttered these last Words,
but he stabbed him with a Dagger, several times,
through the Heart. But this was only the Prologue
to the following Tragedy; for he did not only com∣mand
all his Servants to be either strangled or drown∣ed,
but he went in Person to the Castle of <HI>Columna,</HI>
180 Miles distant from the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and for∣merly
belonging to <HI>Pietrovits;</HI> where 300 of his
Vassals were massacred in the Tyrant's Presence.
But not satisfied with this, after he had, for a whole
Year together, ruined his Estate with Fire and Sword,
he shut up all the Gentlemen (of whom there was a
considerable Number) that held any Lands under
<HI>Pietrovits,</HI> in one House, and so blew them up into
the Air, with Gun-Powder: Their Wives and
Daughters, after they had been ravished by his
Guards, were cut to pieces. The Peasants, with
their Wives and Children, were driven, stark naked,
into the Woods. The Wife of <HI>Pietrovits</HI> was shut
<PB N="335" REF="126"/>
up in a Monastery; and his Children, and whole
Family, destroyed, by the Tyrant's Order.</P>
<P>In the same Year he caused his Chancellor, <HI>Koza∣rin
Dubrowski,</HI> to be slain by his Guards, with two of
his Sons, as they were sitting at Dinner; and a third
Son happening not to be at home, escaped present
Death for that time; but he was afterwards taken,
and Quartered alive.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Titow,</HI> one of his Chief Counsellors of State,
coming one Day to pay his Reverence, as is usual,
to the Great Duke; as he was bowing his Head, he
cut off one of his Ears, with his own Hands; and
presenting it to the Owner, <HI>Accept,</HI> says he, <HI>of this
small Gift at present: Another time I will remember you
better.</HI></P>
<P>These Cruelites exercised on Persons of so emi∣nent
a Rank, struck such a Terrour into the rest of
the Nobility, that they were resolved to try their ut∣most,
whether perhaps they might not be able to di∣vert
him from these cruel Designs. Being therefore
met at a certain Day, to the Number of 300, they
went all in a Body, to represent to the Czar the
Heinousness of his Cruelties; telling him, <HI>That they
were ready to sacrifice both their Lives and Estates for
his Service; and that they would always remain stedfast
in their Allegiance: But, on the other hand, they hoped
he would be pleased not to afflict, in so horrible a manner,
his faithful and innocent Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Duke being not well pleased at their
Errand, he ordered them, all together, to be thrown
into Prison; and some Days after, some to have
their Tongues, others their Legs and Arms cut off;
and 50 of the most Eminent among them were whip∣ped
round the Market-place; the rest were dismis∣sed
without any Punishment for that time, but they
paid afterwards the whole Score, with Interest: For,
in the Year 1570, one Morning, when the Citizens
were opening their Shops, they were not a little sur∣prized
to see 18 Gibbets erected in the Market-place,
surrounded by the Great Duke's Guards, who
had brought along with them all manner of Instru∣ments
<PB N="336" REF="127"/>
for the Torture▪ besides which, there was a
great Fire, and over it was placed a great Caldron,
with boiling hot Water in it. The Citizens, I say,
being terrified at so horrible a Spectacle, and presa∣ging
nothing but the worst to themselves, as being
uncertain for what End all these dreadful Prepara∣tions
were made, some instantly shut up their Shops
again; others, more fearful than the rest, left all
what they had, as it was, and were for saving them∣selves
by Flight, or, at least, for hiding in some more
remote Part of the City; Which Place being thus
put into a general Consternation, the Great Duke,
surrounded by a great Number of his Guards, ap∣peared
in the Market-place, seating himself near the
Caldron of boiling Water. But perceiving that the
Generality of the Citizens had; out of Fear, either
abandon'd their Houses, or, at least, absconded, and
dispersed themselves into the other Quarters of the
the City, he rid in Person through the Streets, cry∣ing
out to them; <HI>Let nothing disturb you: Come, and
see what I am going to do: I give you my Word, that no∣thing
shall hurt you; you may come forth, without the
least Danger to your selves: Therefore come forth, and
see what a Spectacle I am preparing for you.</HI> The Peo∣ple,
partly out of Fear, partly out of Curiosity,
flocked to the Market-place, where they saw 400
Noble-men, of the most antient Families in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
coupled together, Two and Two, like Hounds;
and so miserably disfigured by the Violence of the
Torture, that they were almost not to be known by
their nearest Kindred. To gratifie in some measure
the People, he selected 180 out of their Number:
<HI>Vnto these,</HI> said he, <HI>I give their Lives, for your sakes;
I will pardon them all their Offences: Let them be pre∣sently
discharged.</HI> Which being done accordingly,</P>
<P>The first that was brought forth to Execution, was
<HI>John Michaelovits Wiskowaty,</HI> his Chancellor; descen∣ded
from one of the most antient Families in <HI>Musco∣vy:</HI>
Who being charged with Keeping great Corre∣spondence
with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and inviting the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> to invade <HI>Muscovy,</HI> when he was
<PB N="337" REF="127"/>
just going to be put on one of the Gibbets, he spoke these
following Words: <HI>I call God Almighty, the Infallible
Searcher of Hearts, to witness of what I am going to say,
to be true: I confess my self, before him, to be a miserable
Sword<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and trust in his Mercy, through the Blood of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beloved Son. But as to what concerns the Station
I was lately in, by the Great Duke's Favour, I protest to
God, that I have always discharged my Trust faithfully,
as I ought to do, towards him; and therefore I appeal at
this Instant to the Tribunal of God, where, when I shall
meet the Duke, I will make my Innocence appear to the
Great Judge of Heaven and Earth. I am sensible that,
O Duke, such is thy Ambition, such is thy Avarice and
Thirst after innocent Blood, that nothing but my Life can
satisfie thee at present: Glut thy self therefore with inno∣cent
Blood; but remember that thou must one Day give
a most severe Account of all these most barbarous Cruel∣ties.</HI>
Whilst he was going on in his Discourse, the
Executioner, by the Great Duke's Order, tied him
up to one of the Gibbets, with his Feet upwards,
and his Head hanging down. This done, one of
the Captains of his Guards asked him what he would
have farther done with this Malefactor? <HI>Every one
of you,</HI> said he, <HI>that belong to my Court, here present,
shall lend an helping Hand to send this Traytor out of the
World, whom I will have cut Limb by Limb.</HI> He had
no sooner spoke the Word, but the first Captain of
his Guards, called <HI>Molutlo,</HI> dismounting his Horse, he,
with a little Knife, cut off his Right Ear; the Se∣cond,
his Left; the Third, his Lips; and so every
one, in their Turn, the rest of his Limbs. The Se∣cretary
of the Grand Duke being also to have his
Share in the Execution, at last cut off his Privy
Members; of which he immediately died: Which
the Duke perceiving, and believing that it had been
done on purpose to shorten the Chancellor's Misery,
he ordered him to eat them instantly; which he was
forced to do.</P>
<P>The dead Body of the Chancellor being taken
from the Gibbet, and cut into small pieces, the
next that was brought upon the Scaffold, was
<PB N="338" REF="128"/>
<HI>Michael Tum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chow,</HI> the Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Mus∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y,</HI>
for no other reason but that he had been an
intimate Friend of the Chancellors; he was very
short in his Expressions, saying only these Words:
<HI>I appeal to God, from whom nothing can be hidde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
I never was guilty of any trespass against▪ my Lord and
Master, and that I have faithfully, and without any
fraud, discharged my Office; wherefore, I summon thee,
O Great Duke, to appear on the last day of Judgment,
before the Tribunal of God, where thou shalt be obliged to
make ample satisfaction to me.</HI> Having ended these
Words, he was tied up to the Gibbet, in the same
manner as the Chancellor with his Head downwards,
and very close shaved: After he had hung thus for
some time, two of the Captains of his Guards, each
with a bucket of Water; whereof one was Cold,
the other fill'd out of the Chaldron with Boiling
Water, we mentioned before, approached to the
Gibbet, and he with the cold Water, having first
washed his Head, the other continually poured the
Boiling hot Water upon it, till the Skin was quite
shriveled together, and the poor Treasurer at last
died in the midst of the most exquisite Torments.
The third in order was his Cook, who underwent
the same Fate as the Chancellor, being cut to pieces
Limb by Limb.</P>
<P>After these, follow three of the Great Duke's
chief Secretaries, <HI>George Czapkinou, John Buthakow,</HI>
and <HI>Basili Stepanow;</HI> these were all together with
their Wives and Children cut in pieces, in the Great
Duke's presence, by his Guards: At last, two hun∣dred
of these Noble Men we spoke of before, were
brought before the Great Duke upon the Scaffold;
who having Condem'd them to Die, without as much
as naming their Crime, they were in an instant cut
to pieces by his Guards before his Face. To con∣clude
the Tragedy, the Great Duke ordered to be
brought before him out of Prison (where he had
been detained a great while) a certain person vene∣rable
for his Old Age and Nobility, as being extra∣cted
from a very ancient Family, whom he run
<PB N="339" REF="128"/>
through the Body with his own Lance, and not sa∣tisfied
with that, after the Old Man lay upon the
Ground, wallowing in his Blood, gave him at least
Fifteen or Sixteen Wounds more, till he died upon
the Spot.</P>
<P>This Spectacle having thus continued for four
Hours, the Tyrant before he returned to the Castle,
would needs give a Visit to the Widow of the Trea∣surer,
whom he had caused to be executed just be∣fore.
She was Sister to the Duke <HI>Wiazinski,</HI> and one
of the handsomest Ladies in all <HI>Muscovy,</HI> whom he
found shut up in her Bed-chamber, all over whelm∣ed
with Grief, and lamenting the miserable Death of
her Husband in Terms so Passionate, that it would
have moved Compassion in a heart of Stone. But
the Tyrant being void of all sense of Humanity, no
sooner entred the House, but ordered her to be
stript stark Naked, and to be set with her bare But∣tocks
upon a Rope, fastned titely for that purpose
betwixt two Posts, and so to be drawn upon the
Rope, till the tender Flesh of this Pretty Creature,
not being able to resist long the violence of this moti∣on,
was torn every where to the very Bones, of which
she died some days after. She had a little Daugh∣ter
and Son, who had been forced to be the mourn∣ful
Spectators of their dear Mothers Misery; the
first was sent into a Nunnery, the last Condemned
to a perpetual Punishment. The Chancellor's Wi∣dow
was also forced to embrace the Monastick Life,
and his Son sent Prisoner to the Castle of <HI>Biel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jezoro,</HI>
which lies in one of the <HI>Northern</HI> and most unfrequen∣ted
Provinces of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Some days after this
Slaughter, about Fourscore of the Wives and
Daughters of these two Hundred Nobles, he had
caused to be Butchered before his Face, where drag∣ged
by the Hair, to the River side, where they were
all drowned. About the same time, one of his Se∣cretaries
having been presented with a Pike by a
certain Countryman, the Great Duke having got
Notice of it, caused him to be thrown into a Lake,
where, as he said, he might have Fish enough, since
he was so great a lover of them.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="129"/>
The <HI>Lithuanians</HI> having by a stratagem surprised
the Castle of <HI>Borsko,</HI> took the Governour and his
Lady Prisoners, who being afterwards exchanged
with some <HI>Poles,</HI> returned to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI>
where they were no sooner Arrived, but the Great
Duke ordered three Gibbots to be Erected, on which
the Governor, and two more of his chief Officers
being fastned with a Rope about their Wastes, the
Tyrant and his Son shot their Arrows at them till
they were killed, telling them, ever now and than,
<HI>Thus you ought to have defended your Cause.</HI></P>
<P>His own Brother, though he had lived all along
with the greatest Circumspection in the World, for
fear of giving any occasion of Jealousie to the Ty∣rant,
yet could not escape his hands. For under
pretence that one of his <HI>Bojares,</HI> called <HI>Trzeriack Wis∣konati,</HI>
had given information against him, he caus∣ed
him, without being heard, to be tortured in the
most violent manner that could be invented; and
thus having forced him to make a Confession where
his Treasure was hid, his Head was cut off in the
presence of his Lady, who all this while lay pro∣strate
at the Tyrant's Feet, and in vain was implo∣ring
his Clemency: But instead of lending a favour∣able
Ear to her just Petition, she was stript stark Na∣ked,
exposed to the view of the whole Court, and
afterwards dragged to the River and drown'd.</P>
<P>It used to be a common Custom with him, to
make Ladies of the greatest Qualities to stand Na∣ked
before him, and if he took any liking to them,
after he had abused them himself, to expose them to
the Officers of his Guards, and afterwards cause them
to be hanged at their own Doors, where the Hus∣band
was to go out and in, perhaps for three or four
Weeks, till the Tyrant was pleased to order the
dead Body to be removed. He was something more
favourable to a certain merry Crew of <HI>English,</HI> and
other Women Foreigners, who had, as it seems,
laugh'd at some of his Prancks, which he used to play
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> certain times, when he was in a good Humour;
which he taking Notice of, they were all sent for to
<PB N="341" REF="129"/>
the Palace; where, after they were all stripp'd stark
Naked, in a very large Room, he Commanded seve∣ral
Bushels of Pease to be thrown down before them,
which he made them pick up: When he had done,
he treated them with some Wine, and bid them to
take heed for the future, how they made sport with
so great an Emperor. Perhaps, having been used to
take a view of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Ladies, he took this op∣portunity
to see how far the Foreign Women differed
in Shape from his own Country-Ladies.</P>
<P>After he had, in a manner, thus either ruin'd, or
quite destroyed all the most antient Families of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
he turned his Fury against the <HI>Polish,</HI> and <HI>Li∣thuanian</HI>
Captives, of whom he had a great Num∣ber:
Some of these were slain by his own Hand;
the rest, to the Number of some Thousands, Men,
Women and Children, were, by his Order, cut in
Pieces, or thrown into the River. His Cruelties
exercised against the Inhabitants of <HI>Novogorod, Plesco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and <HI>Twere,</HI> are the most Barbarous in the World, be∣ing
not to be parallel'd in History.</P>
<P>Of the Barbarities committed in the City of <HI>Novogo∣rod,</HI>
we have spoken in the Description of that City;
so that it will be superfluous, to give a further Ac∣count
of them here: We will only add thus much,
That, as he exceeded all the Tyrants that ever were
infamous for their Cruelties, so it was he that perfect∣ed
the Work begun by his Grand-father: to wit, by
suppressing the Antient Nobility, to make himself ab∣solute
Master of this great Empire: Which when he
had obtained, he grew also insupportable to Sove∣reign
Princes. How he treated the <HI>Polish</HI> and <HI>Lithua∣nian</HI>
Captives, we have related before; and his Am∣bition
being unmeasurable, he gave a proof of it to a
<HI>French</HI> Ambassador; who having put on his Hat in his
Presence, he caused it to be Nailed to his Head. Sir
<HI>Jerom Bowes</HI> having, not long after, been sent by
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as Ambassador to him, he not on∣ly
put on his Hat, but also cockt it before him. At
which Boldness, the Tyrant being somewhat start∣led,
asked him, Whether he were ignorant how he
<PB N="342" REF="130"/>
had served the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador? Unt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which, Sir
<HI>Jerom</HI> replied, <HI>That there was a great difference betwixt
them two; That, for his part, he knew whom he Represen∣ted;
that he served a Queen, who knew how to Revenge
any Affront put upon her Ministers.</HI> The Great Duke
was so far from being displeased with this bold An∣swer,
that ever after he had a great esteem for him;
telling his <HI>Bojares,</HI> That he questioned whether, a∣mong
them all, there was one that dare do so much
for him. It was in his Reign that the <HI>English</HI> settled
first their Trade in <HI>Russia,</HI> as we have mentioned
in the Description of the City of <HI>Archangel.</HI> He
had three Sons; of which, the Eldest being struck by
his Father one time, with a stick, died with Grief;
or, as some will have it, by his Father's Lance: The
two others were, <HI>Fedor,</HI> or <HI>Theodor,</HI> and <HI>Demetrius;</HI> the
Eldest of which succeeded him in the Empire. He
Reigned Nine and Thirty Years, and died in the
Year 1584. in the Fifty sixth Year of his Age; belo∣ved
by few, but dreaded both at home and abroad,
and might have been counted one of the greatest
Princes that ever sat upon the <HI>Russian</HI> Throne, if
by his most barbarous Cruelties he had not defaced
the Glory of his great Actions, and had drawn upon
his Family the Vengeance of God, which was very
conspicuous in those Revolutions which after his
Death happen'd in the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire; which,
as they are the most surprising in the World, so we
intend to give a most exact account of them, as well
as the succeeding Reigns, till the Arrival of his pre∣sent
Czarish Majesty in <HI>England,</HI> in the Second Vo∣lum
of this Treatise.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing a full Relation of the Revolutions
in the Muscovian Empire, after the Death
of that Great Tyrant, John Basilovits, to
wit: Ʋnder the Reigns of Fedor Ivano∣vits,
his Son, Boris Goudenou, his Son
Fedor, and the Counterfeit Demetrius.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOhn Basilovits</HI> had by <HI>Anastasia,</HI> his first La∣dy,
two Sons, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Fedor</HI> or <HI>Theodor;</HI>
the first having been slain by his Father's
own Hands, as we told before. <HI>Fedor Iva∣novits</HI>
was after his eldest Brother's Death,
the next Heir to the Empire, and accordingly
Crown'd Grand Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> when he was
scarce two and twenty years of Age. He was
Married some years before his Father's Death, to
<HI>Irene,</HI> Sister of <HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> a Lady of a very
lofty Temper and Carriage, by whom having no
Issue, he had been several times commanded by his
Father, to send her into a Monastery (according to
the Custom of <HI>Muscovy)</HI> but his Affection and
Endearments of this Lady, being more prevailing
with him than his Interest, he had by several De∣lays,
put off the Execution of it. Being now

mounted on the Throne, and <HI>Boris</HI> advanced to
the Dignity of Lord High-Steward of <HI>Muscovy</HI>
(the highest Station, next to the Prince in the Em∣pire)
he knew how to manage the Affection of a
Prince, who always had preferr'd his private Plea∣sures
and Retirement, before Publick Affairs, with
so much Dexterity, that the Princess, in a great
measure, ow'd the continuance of her Greatness to
him, as he was absolutely beholding to her for his
first Advancement.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Goudenou</HI> was a Man naturally qualified for
the Management of Affairs of State, and in a very
few Years had attained to that degree of
Perfection in Flattery and Dissimulation, that he
seem'd to be the Darling both of his Prince and
the People; both being equally well satisfied in his
Conduct. Thus by the Advantages of his Quality
and Dexterity, and the Weakness of the Czar <HI>Fe∣dor,</HI>
having got the whole Management of Affairs
into his own Hands, he began to bend all his
Thoughts, how to secure the Crown of <HI>Muscovy</HI> to
himself and his Family; the better to enable him∣self
to obtain his Ends, after he had gain'd the Af∣fection
of the common People, he resolved to
smooth his way to the Throne, by the Favour of
the Nobility, most of whom having a Dependance
from him, as the only Person, through whose hands
all Places of Honour, Trust or Profit passed, were
soon brought over by the Hopes and Advantages of
Preferments to his Party. Having thus laid the
Foundation to his projected Greatness, the main
Obstacle of his growing Ambition, was <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
the youngest Son of <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> by a second
Adventure, and Brother to the Czar <HI>Fedor Ivano∣vits,</HI>
who was Educated under his Mothers care in
the Castle of <HI>Ʋgletz.</HI></P>
<P>His Death being therefore resolved on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>De∣metrius</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered.</NOTE> four of
the Prince's own Domesticks were by vast Promi∣ses
engag'd to undertake the Fact. The better to
cover their Design, they set at mid-night the City
of <HI>Ʋgletz</HI> on Fire in several places, and having thus
<PB N="3" REF="133"/>
fill'd all with horror and confusion, they ran du∣ring
the general Consternation to the Castle, under
pretence of saving the Prince; and being admitted
into his Bed-chamber, took their Opportunity,
while he was looking out of the Window, to see the
approaching Flame, and stabb'd him in several
places with poyson'd Daggers, and so leaving him
wallowing in his own Blood, took Post for <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣co,</HI>
flush'd with hopes of ample Rewards for so
extraordinary piece of Service. But they were
grievously mistaken in their Account; for <HI>Boris Gou∣denou,</HI>
considering with himself how dangerous
they might prove one time or another to his Af∣fairs,
took a Resolution to take the first Opportunity
of ridding himself of these Evidences of his Trea∣chery;
to effect which, he hir'd others, who by the
Temptations of great Rewards were made the Ex∣ecutioners
of those four Murderers of their
Prince.</P>
<P>To prevent the Murmurs of the People, who
were all startled at the suddenness of so bloody a
Tragedy, he made use of the same Method he had
done at <HI>Ʋgletz;</HI> For, having caused the City of
<HI>Musco</HI> to be set on fire in several Parts, he did not
question but that this general Consternation would
divert the Peoples Thoughts from enquiring into
the true Circumstances of this Murther: And to
remove as far as possibly could be from himself, all
Suspicion of having had the least hand in so barba∣rous
a Murder, he declared, that he would revenge
the Death of the Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> upon the In∣habitants
of <HI>Ʋgletz.</HI> For, no sooner was the first
Consternation, occasioned by the Fire in that City,
a little over, but a Rumor being spread, that the
Prince had been Murder'd, the Inhabitants forced
their Way into the Castle, and transported with a
furious Zeal of revenging his Death, slew all his
Servants, without any distinction. This, which
in all probability seem'd to clear them from the
Stain of the Fact, was by the Contrivance of <HI>Bo∣ris,</HI>
interpreted to their Destruction; alledging,
<PB N="4" REF="134"/>
that they having slain all those from whom any In∣quisition
might have been made concerning this As∣sassination,
it would but be a sufficient Argument
of their Guilt; and that the Murder being to be laid
at their door, they must be proceeded against like
Criminals. In effect, a great many of the Citizens
of <HI>Ʋgletz,</HI> were banish'd, some were tortur'd,
hang'd and drown'd; And not contented thus, af∣ter
he had caused the whole Court to go into Mourn∣ing,
and recommended the Care of the Funebrial
Pomp, to <HI>Knez Basili-zuski,</HI> he commanded the
Castle of <HI>Ʋgletz</HI> to be raz'd and levelled with the
Ground.</P>
<P>Having thus signaliz'd his pretended Passion for
<HI>Demetrius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> his next Care was to remove the only
remaining Obstacle to his Greatness, to wit, the
Grand-Czar <HI>Fedor,</HI> whose End was hastned with
Poyson, after he had reign'd twelve Years. The
Great Duke being sensible of his approaching Death,
did beque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Administration of the Govern∣ment
to his Lady, <HI>Irene,</HI> Sister to <HI>Boris,</HI> to be as∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted
by the Counsel of the Patriarch in Matters
of Moment.</P>
<P>The Widow,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> after his Death, ascended the
Throne without any Reluctancy; but, after she
had for some time labour'd under the weight of so
vast an Empire, whether she was grown weary of
the Burthen, or that she thought it more conveni∣ent
to entail the Crown upon her Family, by trans∣serring
it to her Brother, she declared her self un∣capable
of undergoing it any longer, and acquitting
her self of so great a Charge; and, that she, pre∣ferring
the Contents of a private Life, before the
Toils of a Crown, was ready to resign all her Au∣thority
into the Hands of the Nobility, which she
did accordingly, in the Year▪ 1597.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> who was sufficiently acquainted
with the mutinous Temper of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> when
freed from that Servile Yoak, which otherwise
keeps them under Subjection, and that most
among the Nobles being raised by, and dependent
<PB N="5" REF="134"/>
from his Favour, would not dare to lay hold of
the Government, was resolved to improve the
general Consternation and Confusion of the Peo∣ple
to his Advantage, being sensible that the No∣bles
would be emulous, who should most shew his
Zeal in placing him upon the Throne. Finding
therefore the Nobility ready to make their Addresses
to him, he cunningly caused a Rumor to be spread
abroad by his Emissaries, that being tir'd with the
Toils of his Charge of Lord High Steward of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
he was resolved to quit it, by retiring
into a Monastery, to end the remainder of his Days
in quiet. The People being thus more and more
transported with the Apprehensions of their Ruin,
when they perceived, that among all the Nobility,
there was not one who durst as much as to under∣take
the Management of the Government, they
join'd with the Nobility, and the Clergy, whose
chief Interest consisted in maintaining the Publick
Peace, were of opinion, that all the States of the
Empire ought to make their humble Submissions to
<HI>Boris,</HI> to try whether by their joint Importunities,
he might, perhaps, be prevail'd upon to take upon
him the Burthen of the Empire. The Nuns quit∣ted
their Cloisters, and the Women ran with their
Children in their Arms, to back the Estates of the
Empire, and to offer their most humble Prayers to
<HI>Boris,</HI> like to the tutelar Saint of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> so, that
being at last overcome by their Prayers and La∣mentations,
he yielded to the absolute Necessity of
his Country; and, after he had spoken much in
praise of a retir'd Life, he protested to them, That
<HI>it was not to the Honour and Greatness of his House,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bori Gou∣denou</HI> ac∣cepts of the Crown of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>but meerly to their Importunities, and the Love of his
Country, that he was going to sacrifice all the Satisfa∣ction
he found in a retir'd Life, and that the only mo∣tive,
which made him offer Violence to his own Inclina∣tions,
was, that he could not see any longer so glorious
an Empire, exposed to the imminent Danger of ap∣proaching
Ruin; But knowing himself too weak for
so great a Burthen, he hoped that they would not deny
<PB N="6" REF="135"/>
to Aid him with their Counsels, when Occasion should
require; and that relying upon their Honour and Judg∣ment,
he would chearfully receive the Trust, which he
would be ready to Maintain and Defend to the last Drop
of his Blood, assuring them, that if he could not equal his
Predecessors in Greatness and Glorious Actions abroad,
he would endeavour to exceed them in Temperance and
the Mildness of his Government.</HI></P>
<P>It must be confess'd, that <HI>Boris</HI> did shew no less
Conduct and Wisdom in preserving the Crown,
than he had used dexterity in acquiring it. For he
entirely engag'd the Army to his Service by great
Rewards, he continued the Nobility in their for∣mer
Dignities, and heap'd upon them new Favours
and Preferments; The common People he ty'd to
his Interest, by easing them of their Taxes, and
the Mildness of his Government; and having thus
secur'd the Affections of his Subjects at home, he
was no less careful of Establishing a good Intelli∣gence
abroad with the Neighbouring Princes, for
which purposes, new Treaties were set on foot,
and concluded betwixt him and the <HI>Poles, Swedes,</HI>
and other Nations, bordering upon <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Thus
the whole Interest of his Government seem'd, in
all human Appearance, to be built upon so solid a
Foundation, that no power upon Earth was like to
overturn it, as being founded upon the general
Affections of the People at home under the Ma∣nagement
of a Prince, who, for his Wisdom, Ex∣perience
and Courage, was look'd upon abroad, as
one of the most promising Princes, that ever a∣scended
the Throne of this vast Empire.</P>
<P>But mark the sudden Change of all humane Af∣fairs,
how subject to continual Vicissitudes. What
perhaps the most powerful Foreign Enemy durst
scarce have attempted at that Juncture of Time,
was effected by a poor inconsiderable Monk, who by
his Devices put the whole <HI>Russian</HI> Empire into such
a Confusion, that, in spite of all the Precautions of
<HI>Boris,</HI> he broke all his Measures, and brought the
Empire of <HI>Muscovy</HI> to the very brink of Ruin and
Destruction.</P>

he was descended from a very noble but
decay'd Family, and by his Parents, for his Debau∣cheries,
sent to the Monastery of <HI>Trinouka,</HI> to cor∣rect
his Extravagancies by the Retiredness of a Mo∣nastick
Life. But being not only of an excellent
Wit, but also of a very handsom Aspect and Mien,
and his outward Behaviour and whole Person suita∣ble
to his great Genius; and this Confinement not
agreeing with his aspiring Thoughts, put him into
a deep Melancholy. A certain old cunning Monk
of the same Monastery, who was a secret Enemy
of the then Great Duke <HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> having ta∣ken
notice of it, and judging that the Cause of his
Sadness proceeded from his present Confinement,
the Narrowness of a Monastick Life not being any
wise suitable to his capacious Soul, contracted an
intimate Friendship with him, endeavouring to di∣vert
his Pensivenss by the Instructions he gave him,
first, concerning the Ancient State of the <HI>Russian</HI>
Empire, and afterwards by giving him a full Re∣lation
of the present Posture of Affairs under the
Usurpation of <HI>Boris Goudenou.</HI> Being not unac∣quainted
with the Treacheries by which <HI>Boris</HI> had
compassed his Aim, he did not forget to tell him,
how he had caused <HI>Demetrius</HI> the youngest Son of
<HI>John Basilovits</HI> to be murthered at <HI>Ʋgletz,</HI> how the
Grand Duke <HI>Fedor,</HI> the Elder Brother of <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
was poison'd by his Contrivances; and that
by the Murther of these two Princes, as by so ma∣ny
steps he had ascended the Throne. He told him,
that though his Interest was laid deep at present in
the Nobility, yet that there were not wanting such
among them, as, being sensible of the Treachery
committed against the two Princes, and envying
his Greatness, would not Refuse to embrace the
first Opportunity that offer'd to expose his treache∣rous
Designs to the View of the World, which be∣ing
once done, would soon turn the Affection of
the common People into a mortal Hatred against
him. He cunningly insinuated to the young Monk,
<PB N="8" REF="137"/>
That his Person and Aspect, being not much diffe∣rent
from that of Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and his Genius
sitted for great Undertakings, it would be no diffi∣cult
Task for him to personate the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
(whom they would give out to have been saved
from the Assassins by the Care of his Mother) and,
at once, to punish the Treachery of <HI>Boris,</HI> and to
supply the Place of Prince <HI>Demetrius</HI> in the Throne
of <HI>Muscovy. Grisko,</HI> who was naturally of an As∣piring
Temper, having received the Proposals of
the Old Monk with a great deal of Satisfaction, they
began to concert Measures, which way to put their
projected Design in Execution; and wisely consi∣dering
with themselves, that as soon as the thing
should take the least Vent, there would be no safe∣ty
for this New-model'd <HI>Demetrius</HI> in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> un∣less
at the Head of a considerable Body, it was
thought most advisable for him to retire into
<HI>Poland,</HI> where he might find an Opportuni∣ty
to make himself known to be the true
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> and with the Assistance of his Friends
who by the Prospect of great Advantages might be
drawn into his Interest, publickly lay claim to the
Crown of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Pursuant to this Resolution,
the Old Monk, with his Pupil, travelled towards
the Palatinate of <HI>Kiovia</HI> bordering upon <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
where having introduc'd him into the Service of a
Person of very eminent Quality and Interest in
those Parts, whose Name was <HI>Adam Wisnowiski,</HI>
and given him such further Instructions, as he
thought most conducing towards the Accomplish∣ment
of their Design, he return'd into <HI>Russia,</HI> in or∣der
to prepare the <HI>Muscovites</HI> for the Reception of
this <HI>Demetrius</HI> as soon as he should be in a Capacity
to appear at the Head of a considerable Party up∣on
their Borders. To effect this, he got it whi∣spered
about, That Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the youngest
Son of <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> was still living, that his Mo∣ther
having got timely Notice of the Design of <HI>Boris</HI>
against his Life, had caused him secretly to be con∣veyed
a way from <HI>Ʋgletz</HI> to a place of Safety, and, in
<PB N="9" REF="137"/>
his stead, had provided another Child much of the
same Age, which had been murther'd instead of the
Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who, as he gave it out, was then
in <HI>Poland,</HI> making great Preparations for the Reco∣very
of his Right, against the Usurpation of <HI>Boris.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whilst the Old Monk was thus preparing the
Minds of the</HI> Muscovites, <HI>and especially of the</HI>
Cosacks, Grisko Otropeja, <HI>who in the mean while,
had by all possible means endeavour'd to insinuate
himself into the Favour of</HI> Wisnowiski <HI>with very good
Success, was only watching an Opportunity of ma∣king
his intended Discovery, which soon after of∣fer'd
it self, when he least expected it. For</HI> Wisnowiski
<HI>being in a violent Passion one day, not only call'd
him a Son of a Whore, but also seconded his Words
with some Blows; which Occasion</HI> Grisko <HI>taking
hold of, with a feigned Perplexity, and Tears in
his Eyes;</HI> You would not, <HI>said he,</HI> my Lord, treat
me thus, if you were as well acquainted with my
Quality as my Person; and what grieves me most, is,
that I should receive this Affront from the Man in
whom I had centred all the Hopes of my future
Re-establishment. <HI>Having spoken these Words, ab∣ruptly,
and with a becoming Sadness and Modesty,
he was turning away, from</HI> Wisnowiski, <HI>who being
surprised at</HI> Grisko'<HI>s Discourse, ask'd him▪ all on a
sudden,</HI> And who art thou, then? what is thy Name?
what Business is it has brought thee into this Country?
Grisko Otropeja, <HI>being not unprepared with an An∣swer,
told him, with a well-composed Countenance.</HI>
The same Confidence which swayed me to put my
self under your Protection, obliges me to reveal a Se∣cret
to you, which otherwise ought to be kept concealed
in my own Breast: Know then, that <HI>Muscovy</HI> is my
Native Country, that the Great Duke <HI>John Basilovits</HI>
was my Father, and that I am the same <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
who, by the Assassins sent by <HI>Boris Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>denou,</HI> was to
have been slain at <HI>Ugletz,</HI> had not my Mother (who
had got private Intelligence of the intended Murther)
preserved my Life by sending me away secretly, and
putting a certain Priest's Son, of the same Age, in
<PB N="10" REF="138"/>
my place, who was accordingly assassinated and buried
in my stead. I have ever since lain conceal'd in a
Monastery, till prompted by a just Ambition of Re∣covering
my Right, I took a Resolution to seek for
Aid abroad against the Ʋsurper of my Throne, the
Murtherer of my Brother <HI>Fedor</HI> the late Great Duke,
and my mortal Enemy. <HI>He shew'd him also a Cross
richly beset with Diamonds, which he pull'd out of
his Bosom:</HI> This, <HI>said he,</HI> is the only Remnant of my
former Greatness, and the dear Pledge of my Mo∣thers
Love; and, since I have freely trusted you with
a Secret known but to very few in the World, and
thereby made you Master both of my Life and For∣tune,
I live in hopes that you will not refuse me your
generous Assistance in the Recovery of my Father's
Throne, which I shall always be ready to acknowledge
to the utmost of my Power. Demetrius <HI>was a Person
of a great Presence of Mind, and of an Under∣standing
much above his Years; and being, besides
this, of a very handsom Aspect; this, with the
late Rumour industriously spread abroad by the
Old Monk, first put</HI> Wisnowiski <HI>under a great A∣stonishment;
but having soon recollected himself,
he a thousand times asked his Pardon for the Faults
committed against a Person of his eminent Rank,
with a Promise that he would endeavour to ex∣piate
the same by his future Services for his In∣terest.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce a few Days were past before <HI>Wisnowiski</HI>
got a most magnificent Equipage prepared, in some
Measure suitable to the Greatness of such a Guest,
which he offered to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> with reiterated Pro∣mises,
that he would engage in his Interest, and of
all his Friends to support his Pretensions against the
Usurper <HI>Boris Goudenou.</HI></P>
<P>This sudden Change in the Court of <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI>
being soon spread abroad, as well in <HI>Poland</HI> as in <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
as it served for a strong Confirmation of what
had been whispered about by the Contrivances of
the Old Monk, so it was not long before it reached
the Ears of <HI>Boris Goudenou.</HI> He soon took the A∣larm
<PB N="11" REF="138"/>
at so unexpected and surprizing a piece of
News, and thinking it most advisable to stifle this
Monster in the Birth, he immediately dispatch'd a∣way
a Messenger to the Duke <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> with
Orders to inform him of the Imposture put upon
him by this pretended <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and how unbecom∣ing
his Quality it would be, to espouse the Cause of
an Impostor, against a Legal Prince; neither was
he sparing in his Promises, offering not only vast
Sums of Money, but also considerable Possessions to
that Duke, if he would surrender him dead or
alive into his Hands. But this had a quite contrary
Effect upon <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> who, being in some doubt
before, concerning this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> was now, by the
great Offers made by <HI>Boris,</HI> entirely confirmed in
his Opinion, that he must needs be the true
<HI>Demetrius;</HI> and therefore renewed his former
Resolution of Adhering to his Interest, maugre
all the Temptations of <HI>Boris Goudenou.</HI> But
having wisely considered with themselves, that
he would leave nothing unattempted on his
side, which might facilitate the Destruction of <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
it was judged most advisable not, to expose
his Person any longer so near the borders of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
as was the Duke's House, but to retire to
<HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> a certain place well fortified, and more
remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from the Frontiers, belonging to the Duke
<HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> who, in the mean while returned to
his own House, to get the better Intelligence of
what past in <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Here he was met by ano∣ther
Messenger from the Great Duke, <HI>Boris Goude∣nou,</HI>
who not only by his Master's Orders, renew'd
his former Offers, but also promised more ample
Rewards, if he would surrender the Counterfeit
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> either dead or alive. But this Messen∣ger
meeting with no better Success than the for∣mer,
he received secret Instructions to endeavour
the Destruction of this Impostor, at what rate so∣ever,
not to be sparing of Dagger or Poyson, great
Rewards or any thing else which might contribute
to his Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="139"/>
This was not so secretly carried on, but that <HI>Wis∣nowiski</HI>
had got some Scent of the Design laid a∣gainst
the Life of his Friend; wherefore thinking
him not sufficiently secured against the Attempts of
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> in that place; especially, since they
had drawn together a considerable Force upon the
Frontiers, it was resolved to send him to <HI>George
Mniszeck,</HI> Waywode of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> the Duke's
particular Friend, which would both put him out
of the reach of his Enemies, and probably, streng∣then
his Pretensions with the Interest of one of the
most considerable Men in all <HI>Poland.</HI> Pursuant to
this Resolution, <HI>Demetrius</HI> being provided with
Letters of Recommendation from <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> went
to the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria</HI>'s House, by whom
he was received with all the Honour imaginable,
due to his pretended Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> being now at leisure to make seri∣ous
Reflections upon the present posture of his Af∣fairs,
had no reason to be dissatisfied with his Con∣dition,
as being not without hopes of encompas∣sing
his End, with the assistance of such powerful
Friends; but wisely considering with himself, that
their first Heat might, by degrees, grow weak, if
not quite become cool, if not sustained by suffici∣ent
Fuel to nourish it, he employed all his Thoughts
to establish, by some means or other, his Fortune,
upon a more solid Foundation, than that of bare
Friendship. He was sensible, that the Persons,
among whom he now lived, and from whom he
chiefly rely'd in reference to his Grand Design, were
all Zealous <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> he very well foresaw,
that if he expected to be back'd by them in his
Pretensions, he ought at least, to shew some Incli∣nation
to the same Faith, without which▪ he judg∣ed
that their Friendship would be very unstable.
To obtain therefore this End, he thought it most
convenient to make his Applications to the Jesuites,
whom, by reason of their great Zeal for the <HI>Roman
Catholick</HI> Cause, and the free Access and Influence
they have over Persons of the greatest Quality, he
<PB N="13" REF="139"/>
knew to be the most proper Instruments for the
managing of his Design. <HI>Demetrius</HI> therefore,
having given them some assurances of his Inclina∣tions
towards that Religion they professed; these
Fathers being over-joy'd at the prospect of so great
a Proselyte; under whose Protection, they pro∣mised
themselves one day to join one of the most
Potent Kingdoms in the World to the Papal Chair,
were not negligent in their Duty, but readily offer∣ed
both their Counsels and real Assistance to <HI>Deme∣trius.</HI>
After they had frequently discours'd him
concerning the Chief Articles of Faith, in Dispute
betwixt the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Muscovite</HI> Church,
and given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such further Instructions, as they
judged most convenient for their present Purpose,
they were also not wanting in their Advice towards
the promoting of his main Design.</P>
<P>They proposed to him a Marriage with <HI>Marina,</HI>
the Daughter of <HI>George Mniszeck,</HI> Weywode of
<HI>Sendomiria,</HI> who entertain'd him at that time in his
House; she was a Lady young and sprightly, and
the Jesuits knowing her besides this, to be of a very
haughty Temper▪ they did not question, but that
the prospect of a Crown would be temptation too
powerful for her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o resist; which would at once
strengthen his Interest in <HI>Poland,</HI> and remove all
further Doubts, among the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Cosacks,</HI>
of his being the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> Son of the Great
Duke, <HI>John Basilovits.</HI> They represented to him,
that <HI>Boris Goudenon,</HI> being a great Politician, had
so firmly established himself in the Throne of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> that without the assistance of such a Per∣son
as the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> it would be
impossible for him to shake his Interest; that they
knew the Weywode to be one of the most ambiti∣ous
Men in the World; and that therefore, if he
could condescend to enter with him into a more
strict Alliance, by Marrying his Daughter, it would
be the most powerful Motive to engage him abso∣lutely
into his Interest. They advised him there∣fore,
to make his Addresses first to <HI>Marina,</HI> and
<PB N="14" REF="140"/>
after he had sounded her Inclinations, to offer the
same Proposition to her Father, when they would
be sure to back his Pretensions with all the Inte∣rest
they had.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius,</HI> who had already been touch'd by the
sparkling Eyes of <HI>Marina,</HI> receiv'd this Proposi∣tion
of the Jesuits, with the utmost Satisfaction;
and being spurr'd on by a double Motive, to wit,
that of his Love and Interest, he sought only for a fit
Opportunity to declare his Passion to his admir'd
Mistress, which he having soon met with one day,
as he was walking with her in the Garden, he by
the most passionate and tender Expressions in the
World, endeavour'd to make her sensible of his
Love; which she having received with a seeming
Indifferency, he made his next Applications to the
Weywode her Father, unto whom he represented
his Desire of allying himself with his Family by
Marrying his Daughter, <HI>Marina,</HI> the possession of
whom he preferr'd before the Crown, even of <HI>Mus∣covy</HI>
it self. The Weywode, who had been before∣hand
prepared by the Jesuits, being not in the least
surprised at this Proposition; after he had thank'd
him for the Honour he intended to do his
Family, told him, that he thought he was a
little too hasty in applying his Thoughts to Mar∣riage,
at a time when the Eyes of the whole World
were upon him, looking for the Success of his En∣terprize.
That a Mistress, at this Juncture of Time,
might prove a great Obstacle to his Affairs; that,
as he stood in need of the powerful Assistance of
some Princes, so it was possible one or other of
them might be for fortifying their Alliances with
him by a Marriage, which, if refused, might
prove very prejudicial to his Affairs. He conclud∣ed,
that as his Honour and Welfare were more dear
to him than his own Interest; so he advised him
to gain his Mistresses Heart by the Point of his
Sword, and by opening his Passage to the Throne
of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scovy,</HI> through the Heart of him that Usurp'd
his Right. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who by the Father's An∣swer,
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
and the Indifferency of the Daughter, was
fully persuaded, that the Success of his Love, did
absolutely depend from his Establishment in the
Throne, apply'd himself with more than ordinary Vi∣gour
to the accomplishing of his Design. For which
Purpose, he was more conversant than ever with
the Jesuits, and having at last declared to them his
Resolution of becoming a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> and
Establishing the same Religion in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as soon
as he should ascend that Throne; these Fathers be∣ing
over-joy'd at this Declaration, promised him
their utmost Endeavours in procuring the Assistance
both of the Holy Father, <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. and <HI>Sigis∣mund,</HI>
King of <HI>Poland.</HI> Being flush'd with these
hopes, he reiterated his passionate Addresses to his
Mistress and the Weywode, so, that, at last he having
obtained their Consent, in case he should recover
his Throne, these following Articles were agreed
on betwixt them: <HI>That in Consideration of the Sup∣plies
and Aids to be given to</HI> Demetrius, <HI>he should be
obliged, after his, Accession to the Crown, to re-pay the</HI>
Weywode <HI>his full Charges, Marry the Lady</HI> Mari∣na,
<HI>his Daughter, and introduce the</HI> Roman Faith <HI>in</HI>
Muscovy. These Articles being Sign'd and Rati∣fied,
he was by the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria</HI> and
<HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> introduced to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who,
at the Recital of his Circumstances, being mov'd
with Compassion, did not only give him a very fa∣vourable
Reception, but also granted him Permis∣sion,
to levy what then he stood in need of, for his
intended Expedition, in his Dominions. This Au∣dience
turn'd to the no small Advantage of <HI>Deme∣trius.</HI>
For, it having been very industriously spread
abroad, in what a favourable Manner he had been
received by King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> this did not only much
strengthen his Party in <HI>Poland,</HI> where a great many
Persons of Quality espoused his Interest, but also
had such a powerful Influence upon the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
that they began to exclaim at the Treacheries of
<HI>Boris;</HI> and most of them out of Fear, others out
of hope of Rewards, only stay'd for a favourable
<PB N="16" REF="141"/>
Opportunity to declare for him, whom they now
began to look upon as their Natural Prince.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> having soon got notice, how the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
stood affected, and brought over to his Par∣ty
by great Presents, some of the leading Men a∣mong
them, thought it now high Time to put his
long projected Design in Execution. The Wey∣wode
of <HI>Sendomiria</HI> had all this while been em∣ployed
in raising considerable Forces in <HI>Poland,</HI> for
this Expedition, and the Duke <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> having
also publickly declared for <HI>Demetrius,</HI> a considera∣ble
Number of the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility, on the Fron∣tiers
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> being encouraged by his Exam∣ple,
espoused this Interest. Being strengthened by
these and other Forces, which were in several parts
of the Kingdom, raised for his Service, he march∣ed
at the Head of them into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> in the heart
of the Winter, where, being joyned by a Body of
<HI>Cosacks</HI> of 10000 Men, under their General <HI>Corclos,</HI>
who had been engaged with great Promises into his
Service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demetri∣us <HI>enters</HI> Muscovy.</NOTE> by the Artifices of the old Monk, it struck
such a Terror into the Inhabitants of the neigh∣bouring
Provinces, that, as soon as his Army had
passed the <HI>Boristhenes</HI> at <HI>Kiovia,</HI> they advanced
without any Opposition, to the very Walls of <HI>E∣ringow,</HI>
which upon the first Summons surrendred
to <HI>Demetrius.</HI> The City of <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> one of the
largest and most populous in those Parts followed
the Example of <HI>Eringow;</HI> the Garrison, which con∣sisted
for the most part of <HI>Cosacks,</HI> refused to fight
against their Brethren. The other Places of less
Note, trod the Footsteps of the others, and put
themselves under his Protection; so that, as he was
advancing deeper into the Country, his Army was
considerably augmented by such as flock'd in to
him from all the adjacent Cities, of which none
attempted to make the least Resistance, except the
City of <HI>Novogorod Sevie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ki,</HI> which he besieg'd and
attack'd with all the Vigour imaginable. The Czar,
<HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> in the mean while had not been
careless of his Affairs, but having ordered conside∣rable
<PB N="17" REF="141"/>
Levies to be made before; as soon as he re∣ceived
Advice of the most stupendious Progress of
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> he published his Declaration, wherein
he promised Indempnity to all such of his Subjects
as would abandon the Party of this Impostour, and
return to their Duty, with most severe Commina∣tions
against all such as should persist in their trea∣sonable
Designs against their Sovereign, in aiding
and assisting the pretended <HI>Demetrius.</HI> He sent al∣so
a solemn Ambassy to <HI>Sigismund,</HI> then King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> who having immediately demanded and
obtained Audience, made most heavy Complaints;
<HI>That the Truce, which was so lately made betwixt
the two Crowns for Twenty Years, was violated by
the</HI> Poles, <HI>who without the least Reason given, had in∣vaded
the Czar's Territories, taken his Towns, and
ravaged the Country: That he hoped the King would
take better Measures, and not pursue a War that was
founded upon nothing but an unjust Pretence, but recall
his Troops▪ which were at that time employed to main∣tain
the Pretensions of a vile Impostor, against one
of the most potent Princes in</HI> Europe, <HI>who, if pro∣voked,
would not want means to give himself Satis∣faction
for the Damages and Affronts received from
the Crown of</HI> Poland. Neither was he sparing in
his Promises, by which, and the great Presents he
made to most of the Chief Ministers and other
great Men of the Court, he hoped to obtain what
all his Remonstrances had not been able to effect,
but in vain; for whether it were, that they look'd
upon <HI>Demetrius</HI> as the true Heir of the Crown, and
upon the Affairs of <HI>Boris</HI> as in a declining Condi∣tion,
or that the Authority of the Pope and Jesuits
who had espoused the Interest of the first, had
made them deaf to all these Applications, the Am∣bassador
was sent back with this general Answer:
<HI>That the King and Commonwealth of</HI> Poland <HI>were not
concerned in what was transacted in</HI> Muscovy; <HI>and
that, if</HI> Demetrius, <HI>who was a</HI> Muscovite <HI>born, had
obtained the Assistance of some</HI> Polish <HI>Volunteers to
maintain his Pretensions against the Czar</HI> Boris Gou∣denou,
<PB N="18" REF="142"/>
<HI>this could not be interpreted a Violation of
the Truce betwixt the two Crowns, which on their side
they would observe inviolably. Boris</HI> having missed
his Aim in <HI>Poland,</HI> dispatched a Messenger to the
Camp of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> to try once more his Fortune,
and to endeavour to undeceive the Wayvode of
<HI>Sendomiria,</HI> and <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> concerning the Fallacy
put upon them by the Counterfeit <HI>Demetrius.</HI> For
this End having found out one of his Uncles in
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Smyrna Otropeja,</HI> and
judging, not without Reason, that if he could be
confronted with <HI>Grisko Otropeja,</HI> his Nephew, his
Confession would be of the greatest Consequence
towards the Detecting of this Imposture; he sent
him along with the Messenger▪ But whether the
Wayvode look'd upon that as a Contrivance of <HI>Boris
Goudenou,</HI> invented on purpose to blast the Repu∣tation
of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and to ward the Blow which
seemed to threaten his Ruin; or that he thought
himself engaged past retreating; the Uncle, <HI>Smyr∣na
Otropeja</HI> was forbid, under pain of Death, to ap∣proach
the Camp, and the Messenger sent back with
Scorn and Indignation.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> finding all other Means to fail, had
Recourse to Arms, and ordered his Army, which
consisted of above a Hundred thousand Men, most
of them Vetera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Soldiers, to march to the Relief
of <HI>Novogorod Sevierski,</HI> which defended it self
bravely against the <HI>Poles,</HI> under the Conduct of
their Governour <HI>Bosman. Demetrius,</HI> tho' much
inferiour in Number, (being not much above
Twenty thousand, but all chosen Men) upon the
Approach of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army, leaving the
Siege of <HI>Novogorod,</HI> posted himself as advantageous∣ly
as he could, in sight of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> to facili∣tate
the Passage of such Officers in the Army of <HI>Bo∣ris
Goudenou,</HI> as being corrupted before, had pro∣mised
to come over with their Soldiers to his Party.
But these seeing the great Disproportion there was
betwixt the Numbers of these two Armies, either
quite changed their Resolutions, or at least thought
<PB N="19" REF="142"/>
it most advisable to delay the Execution of it till a
more favourable Juncture.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> therefore finding himself in a Post
from whence he could not retreat without fighting,
was forced to put the best Countenance he could
upon the Matter, and having nothing to trust to
but their own Courage, the <HI>Poles</HI> fought so bravely,
that they not only repulsed the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who
being over confident in their Number attack'd
them with more Fury than Skill, but also charged
them at several times with so much bravery, that
the Victory remain'd doubtful for several Hours;
till at last the <HI>Muscovites</HI> being continually sustain∣ed
by fresh Troops, and the <HI>Poles</HI> quite tired by
the long Fatigues of the Day, were forced to give
way, more to the Number than the Bravery of
their Enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deme∣trius rout∣ed.</NOTE> who at last entirely routed them,
(though not without a great Slaughter on their
side) killing 9000 of them upon the Spot, with
the loss of all their Cannon and Baggage.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Muscovites</HI> had been as careful in the Pur∣suit
of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> as they were fortunate in ob∣taining
the Victory, and had sent their Horse (of
which they had a considerable number) immedi∣ately
after, to disperse such of the <HI>Polish</HI> Troops
as were retreating in several Bodies towards <HI>Rib∣scum,</HI>
they might without question have put an
End to the War at this one Stroke, or at least have
driven him quite out of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> But instead of
pursuing their Advantage, they besieged <HI>Krom,</HI> which
defending it self with an extraordinary Bravery;
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> whilst these wasted themselves in the
Siege of this Place, had full Leisure given him to
rally his scattered Troops at <HI>Ribscum,</HI> and there to
expect the Return of the <HI>Waywode</HI> and <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI>
who were gone to their respective Countries to raise
fresh Supplies for this Service.</P>
<P>Being at last made sensible of their Mistake, they
resolved to send part of their Army to attack him
under <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>scum,</HI> before he could be reinforced with
such Auxiliaries as he expected to join his Forces,
<PB N="20" REF="143"/>
and to leave the rest to carry on the Siege of <HI>Krom.</HI>
Pursuant to this Resolution, they sent Fifty thou∣sand
of their best Men to attack <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who
with about six or seven Thousand, most Horse, the
Remnants of his Army, had strongly intrenched
himself under <HI>Ribscum.</HI> Having got timely No∣tice
of the Approach of the Enemy, he detached a
Thousand of his best Horse, to approach their Camp,
and to get what Intelligence they could concern∣ing
the Posture of the Enemy, but these having
sent out a more numerous Body of Horse to en∣gage
the <HI>Demetrians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ris</HI> routed.</NOTE> there ensued a fierce Combat,
both Parties being reinforced with fresh Supplies
from their Camps: But the <HI>Polish</HI> Horse behaved
themselves so gallantly, that after two Hours En∣gagement
they totally routed the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and
closely pursuing them with a great slaughter to
their Camp, where their Foot were just drawing
up in order of Battle, to sustain their Horse, these
pressed all in Confusion with such Violence upon
their own Infantry, that they soon broke their Ranks,
and brought the whole Army into such a Disor∣der,
that <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who by this time was advanc'd
with the Remainder of his Army, soon put them to
the rout, and forced them to leave their Camp
and Artillery, as a Reward of his Victory.</P>
<P>The Fame of so signal a Defeat having been
soon spread all over the neighbouring Provinces,
all the great Cities thereabouts declared for the
Conquerour; the whole Province of <HI>Severia,</HI> one
of the largest in all <HI>Muscovy,</HI> followed the Exam∣ple
of the rest, and furnished his victorious Army
with all Necessaries, which by this sudden Change
of Fortune, grew every day more numerous;
those who hitherto out of Fear had been backward
in decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing themselves, now striving to out-do
one another, in giving the most evident Demon∣strations
of their Zeal for the Interest of the Victo∣rius
<HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boris,</HI> on the other Hand, tho' not a little start∣led
at so sudden an Accident, yet did not lose
<PB N="21" REF="143"/>
Courage, but having rally'd his scatter'd Troops, and
ordered new Levies to be made, he sent his Spies
and Emissaries into the Camp of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> to try
whether, by the hopes of Pardon and great Re∣wards,
they could bring over the Revolted <HI>Russians</HI>
to their Allegiance to him, and especially to entice
the <HI>Cosacks</HI> from <HI>Demetrius</HI> to his Party, or whether
by some means or other, they could not dispatch and
send him to the other World. But some of these
Emissaries being discovered, and put to the Torture,
made an Ingenuous Confession of the Truth, and
were without any further Punishment, sent back
to <HI>Boris,</HI> with this Errand, that it was little be∣coming
his present high Station, to make use of
Poyson and Daggers against his Enemy, and that
he did not question, but that before long, he should
be ready to call him to a severe Account for this,
as well as his other treacherous Devises; But that,
if he would give him real Demonstrations of his
sincere Repentance, by surrendring the Crown to
him whose unquestionable Right it was, he would
grant him, and all his Adherents a general Amne∣sty,
for all past Crimes and Misdemeanours.</P>
<P>But <HI>Boris</HI> having rejected these Offers with Scorn,
and yet seeing his Adversary encrease in Strength
every day, he resolved to try the utmost, and
whether by one dextrous Blow, he could not over∣throw
him and his Designs. He was not ignorant
that the main strength of his Army consisted in the
Auxiliaries and Supplies, he from time to time re∣ceived
out of <HI>Poland,</HI> and that if he could by any
means, deprive him of his foreign Aids, the rest
would soon disperse, or at least easily be reduced
to obedience. He wisely considered, that, if a
considerable Diversion could be procured to the
<HI>Poles</HI> at home, they would be obliged to recall
their Subjects out of the Service of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who
deprived of their Assistance, like a Body of its
best Nourishment, would soon be reduced to a
languishing Condition. But the circumstances of his
Affairs, being such as not to permit him to attempt
<PB N="22" REF="144"/>
alone this intended Diversion, a Treaty was set on
foot with the <HI>Swedish</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Ambassadours,
then residing in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> to Embroil <HI>Si∣gismund,</HI>
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> at his own doors, by the
assistance of these two Crowns. But whilst they
were busied in concerting measures to put this in
Execution, and <HI>Boris</HI> apply'd his whole Care in re∣settling
his Affairs, he was on a sudden, seiz'd with
a most violent Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, which immediately after,
being followed by a great quantity of Blood, which
issued out of his Mouth, Ears and Nostr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, he died
in an Instant; some say for Grief, some of an Ap∣poplexy,
others of Poyson by the Contrivances of
<HI>Demetrius.</HI> However it was, he expir'd on the
13th of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year 1605, in the Seventh
Year of his Reign. He shew'd so much Mildness
and Moderation during the Time of his Govern∣ment,
that he might well be placed among the best
of Princes, if he had not opened his way to the
Throne of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> by the Murder of his lawful
and natural Prince.</P>
<P>The sudden Death of <HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sud∣den Death of <HI>Boris Goudeno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI></NOTE> hapning at
so critical a Juncture, when all his Friends had con∣ceived
great hopes of his intended Diversion against
the <HI>Poles,</HI> put them under a great Consternation,
and the greatest part of the Nobility and Army,
looking upon this unexpected Change, as ominous
to his Family, shew'd a great Inclination in Favour
of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> whose Power began now to appear
more formidable to them, than before; But the
Populacy▪ who had as yet fresh in remembrance
the Benefits received from <HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> especial∣ly,
during the great Famine, in the Years 1601,
1602, and 1603, declared for <HI>Fedor</HI> his Son, and
having forced the Boyars and Chief Officers of the
Army to do the same, he was placed in the Throne,
and his Mother constituted Regent, during his Mi∣nority.</P>
<P><HI>Fedor</HI> or <HI>Theodore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Son <HI>Fedor</HI> suc∣ceeds him.</NOTE> being thus mounted on the
Throne, under the Tuition of his Mother, apply'd
all his Care to stop the Progress of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and
<PB N="23" REF="144"/>
having received Intelligence, that he intended sud∣denly
to march to the Relief of <HI>Krom,</HI> which was
still besieg'd by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> he declared <HI>Bosman,</HI>
who had so valiantly defended <HI>Novogorod</HI> in his Fa∣ther's
Time, General over his Army, which after∣wards
proved fatal to the whole <HI>Borisian</HI> Family.
For <HI>Hodwen,</HI> a near Kinsman of <HI>Boris Goudeno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
and General of his Forces during his Reign, have∣ing
got timely notice of the Resolutions taken at
Court, in favour of <HI>Bosman,</HI> by the powerful In∣fluence
he had over the principal Officers of the
Army, soon prevail'd with them, to refuse to sub∣mit
to the Command of <HI>Bosman,</HI> as a Soldier of
fortune, which Affront, he dissembled for a while,
till he met with a favourable Opportunity to re∣venge
it upon the whole Family of the Great
Duke, as we shall see anon. In the mean while,
<HI>Demetrius</HI> had commanded the greatest Part of his
Army under the Conduct of <HI>Zaporius,</HI> to advance
towards <HI>Krom,</HI> and endeavour its Relief, who have∣ing
accordingly directed his March to the <HI>Musco∣vian</HI>
Camp, he received Intelligence by the means
of <HI>Bosman,</HI> of the Posture of the Enemy, and
that he intended to come over to his Party, as soon
as a favourable Opportunity should present. <HI>Za∣porius</HI>
being resolved to improve so advantageous
an Offer, was impatient to come to Blows with
the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> but these being both superior in
Number, and strongly Entrench'd, and consequent∣ly
not to be attack'd, without exposing the whole
Army, he drew them out of their advantageous
Entrenchments by the following Stratagem: He
contrived a Letter, directed to the Governour and
Chief Officers of the Garrison of <HI>Krom,</HI> wherein,
after having highly extolled their Valour and Zeal,
and made them ample Promises of Rewards, he
told them, that he was advanced with a considera∣ble
Force near the Enemies Camp, to annoy them,
and to intercept their Foragers, till the arrival of
Prince <HI>Demetrius</HI> himself, who was on his March, at
the Head of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and other Auxiliaries,
<PB N="24" REF="145"/>
lately arrived from <HI>Poland,</HI> to oblige the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
to raise the Siege. This Letter being given to
one, who undertook to carry it into the Place, he
was directed thus to the City, by the secret Orders
of <HI>Zaporius,</HI> that he must of necessity fall into the
Hands of the Enemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s advanced Guards; which
having suceeded accordingly, the poor Fellow was
carried before the <HI>Muscovite</HI> General; where have∣ing
been examined, he was forced to produce the
Letter, which, as he believ'd, was to have been
carried into the City.</P>
<P><HI>Hodwen,</HI> the General of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army,
having perused the Letter, and over-joy'd at the
Discovery of the approach of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> call'd im∣mediately
a Council of War, wherein it having
been judged most convenient, to attack the Ene∣my
before they could be join'd by <HI>Demetrius,</HI> it
was resolved, to leave only a small Body to keep
the Avenues leading to the Town, and with the
rest to give Battle to <HI>Zaporius.</HI></P>
<P>He soon perceiving by the Countenance of the
Enemy, that his Design had thus far succeeded ac∣cording
to his wish, drew out his Forces in Bat∣tle-Array;
but being much inferior in number, and
fearing, not without Reason, lest <HI>Bosman</HI> with his
Party, might be discouraged by the inequality of
their Number, he resolved to back his Letter with a
second Stratagem. He placed all the Servants, Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lers,
and other useless Persons belonging to the
Baggage, at some distance behind the Army, with
whom having join'd some Soldiers, enough to
make up a Front, he order'd them, after they had
seen him Engag'd for some time, to advance in
good Order, with their Colours flying, Drums
beating, and Trumpets sounding. Thus having
prepared every thing according to his intended
Purpose, he marched directly towards the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI>
whom he attack'd with the utmost Vigour;
but these being without intermission re-inforced by
fresh Troops, gave so much work to the <HI>Poles,</HI> that
the Fight was very obstinate and bloody, and the
<PB N="25" REF="145"/>
latter would have been in no small danger of lo∣sing
the Day, had not <HI>Bosman,</HI> who Commanded
the Body of Reserve in the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Army, as
soon as he saw the <HI>Polish</HI> Mock Army advance, in
the greatest heat of the Battle, with some of his
Party, gone over to <HI>Zaporius,</HI> and declared for
Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> crying out aloud to the <HI>Musco∣vites,
that they should cease to fight against their Na∣tural
Prince. Bosman</HI> being the Darling of the
common Soldiers, his Words and Example had such
a powerful Influence over them, that like one Man,
they cry'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mus∣covites</HI> re∣volt.</NOTE> they would live and die with him.</P>
<P>The Nobility and Chief Officers of the Army,
finding themselves deserted by the Soldiers, resolv∣ed
immediately to send their Deputies to <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
who at that time resided at <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> to ac∣knowledge
their Fault in having so long stood out
against their Prince; to implore his Pardon for
what was past, and to give him all the imaginable
Assurances of their Fidelity, for the future. <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
transported with Joy at so welcome a piece
of News, lost no time, but having immediately
put himself at the Head of such Troops as he had
with him at <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> march'd directly first to
<HI>Krom,</HI> where he caused <HI>Hodwen,</HI> the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
General to be clapt in Irons, and from thence to
<HI>Avol,</HI> where the revolted Army lay Encamped;
Being arrived there, and having received fresh De∣monstrations
of their entire Submission to his Com∣mands,
he offer'd his Thanks to the Chief Men,
but especially to <HI>Bosman</HI> and his Friends, and by his
Caresses, so gain'd upon the Affections of the com∣mon
Soldiers, that they all with one Voice, de∣sired
him to Lead them against the Son of the U∣surper
of his Crown.</P>
<P>Being thus become absolutely Master of the Field
and the Army, and believing that now, he had but
one step left to ascend the Throne, to wit, to make
himself Master of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> the Capital
of the whole Empire, he ordered every thing to
be got ready for the March. Whilst he was thus
<PB N="26" REF="146"/>
advancing by slow Marches towards <HI>Musco,</HI> he sent
his Letters to the Magistrates of that City, wherein
he told them, he was near at hand with a most
Potent Army, ready to attack them at his first
Command; but that taking commiseration of their
Condition, he exhorted them to make choice of the
fruits of Peace before the inevitable Calamities of
War. That if they preferred the last before the
first, they must be answerable for all the Miseries,
which are the necessary Consequences of an intestine
War; but as he was persuaded they would consult
their own Safety, he advised them to root out the
whole Progeny of that accursed Traytor, <HI>Boris Gou∣denou,</HI>
who had murder'd his Brother, the late
Great Duke <HI>Fedor,</HI> and would have acted the same
Tragedy with himself, if it had not been prevented
by the Vigilancy and Care of his Royal Mother; and
lastly, not to delay any longer to shew their Rea∣diness
in Asserting the undoubted Right of their
Natural Prince.</P>
<P>This Letter having been read in the Presence of
the People and the Messenger of <HI>Demetrius</HI> in the
Market-place, they began to assemble in great Num∣bers,
and after a short Consultation what Measures
were best to be taken, they sent some among them
to the Palace of <HI>Knez Basilizuski,</HI> who having per∣emptorily
demanded of him to declare before them,
whether this were the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> Youngest Son
of Czar <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> that lay now encamped
near their City, <HI>Zuski</HI> positively asserted, <HI>that he
was;</HI> and that he had been saved from the Assassins
sent by <HI>Boris Goudenou</HI> for his Destruction, by the
Prudence of his Mother, who had put another in
his stead. The People absolutely relying, upon
what they had understood from a Person of so emi∣nent
a Rank, and who himself in Person had been
employed by <HI>Boris,</HI> to take care of the Funeral of
<HI>Demetrius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musco</HI> de∣clares for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> and dreading, besides this, a potent
Army so near their Gates, cry'd out with one
Voice, <HI>Long live</HI> Demetrius, <HI>Great Duke, and Em∣perour
of</HI> Russia! <HI>Come let us destroy that viperous
Brood of the</HI> Goudenou's.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="146"/>
Their Words were soon seconded with Blows;
for having soon forced some of <HI>Fedor</HI>'s Guards,
that were come to appease the Tumult, to retire,
they went streightways to the Castle, and sacrifi∣cing
all to their Fury, that opposed their Passage,
they entred the Royal Palace, where they massacred
most of the Friends and Relations of <HI>Boris;</HI> the
rest they stript stark naked and shut them up in a
Fort within the Castle, Men, Women and Children,
without distinction of Age or Sex, where they
perished in a most miserable manner, either by
Cold or Famine, none of the Kindred of <HI>Boris</HI>
escaping their Fury, except the Great Duke <HI>Fedor,</HI>
the Empress Regent and her Daughter, who were
preserved, not out of any Esteem for their Digni∣ty
or Persons, but wherewith to purchase their
Pardon from <HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P>The Empress Dowager was a Lady of a Mascu∣line
Spirit and undaunted Courage, who, when
she reflected upon the Barbarities committed a∣gainst
the whole Family of her deceased Lord, was
soon convinced, that she and her Children were
only reserved for to adorn the Triumph of <HI>Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣trius,</HI>
and to serve as a Pledge of the Fidelity of
these barbarous Wretches, who being void of all
Humanity, had made such bloody Returns to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Family of him from whose Hands they had recei∣ved
so many signal Benefits. She had therefore
prepared a Cup filled with strong Poison, and
proposing no less to herself and her two dear Chil∣dren,
than the most ignominious Death that could
be invented by the enraged Conquerour, with a
most Heroick Constancy, <HI>Come,</HI> says she, <HI>Come,
the dearest Pledges of your Father's Love, Come,
once my greatest Joy, but now my highest Gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, let
us not linger out for a few Days a miserable Life,

the Way to destroy us more ignominiously; Let us by
our own Choice accelerate that fatal Separation which
is prepared for us by the Hands of our merciless Ene∣mies.</HI>
She had no sooner spoke these last Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds
<PB N="28" REF="147"/>
but she took the Cup, and, having taken a good
draught of this poisonous Potion, she forced her
Children to take the rest of the fatal Liquor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Death of <HI>Fedor</HI> and the Empress.</NOTE> and
then grasping them both in her Arms, they thus ex∣pired
in their mutual Embraces; after the young
<HI>Fedor</HI> had sat scarce two Months upon the
Throne.</P>
<P>There are not a few who affirm, that the Prin∣cess
only poisoned herself, but being preserved by
<HI>Demetrius</HI>'s Order, to satisfie his Lust, was after∣ward
by his secret Order strangled with both her
Children and that it was only given out they had
poisoned themselves. But the first Relation seems
the most probable, this beforementioned Tragedy
having been acted on the tenth day of <HI>June,</HI> in the
Year 1605, several Days before <HI>Demetrius</HI> came in∣to
the City of <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst the Populacy exercised their Barbarities
upon the Remnant of the Family of the <HI>Goude∣nou's,
Demetrius</HI> having been advertised of what
had passed in the City by their Deputies, who told
him that they were ready to receive him, he order∣ed
every thing to be prepared for his Reception a∣gainst
the 20th of <HI>June,</HI> when he was met at
two or three Miles Distance from the City, not on∣ly
by the Magistrates, but also most of the Nobi∣lity
on Horseback,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deme∣trius</HI> pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Emperou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and having thus made his So∣lemn
Entrance thro' the Crowds and Acclama∣tions
of the People, and been proclaimed Empe∣rour
of all <HI>Russia;</HI> he took up his Residence the same
Night in the Royal Palace.</P>
<P>This solemn Entrance into the City, was not
long afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> followed by his Coronation, which was
performed, with the usual Solemnities, towards
the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter end of the next following Month, with
the loud and joyful Acclamations of the Peo∣ple,
<HI>Long live</HI> Demetrius, <HI>God save our Great
Duke, May all his Enemies perish!</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who had now assumed the Sir∣name
of <HI>Ivanovits,</HI> from his pretended Father,
the Great Duke <HI>Ivan</HI> or <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Basilovits,</HI> judging,
<PB N="29" REF="147"/>
not without Reason, that scarce any thing would
contribute more at this time to strengthen his Title,
and put his Birth beyond all question, than if he
were acknowledged by the Mother of the true
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> who had been murthered at <HI>Vgletz,</HI> he
sent to her a Messenger with secret Dispatches to
the Monastery where she had been shut up for se∣ven
Years last past, inviting her to the City of
<HI>Musco,</HI> and the Royal Palace. She, who saw her
self thus at once freed from so long a Confinement,
and at the same time put in a Condition to revenge
her self of the Barbarities committed against her Fa∣mily
by the Treachery of <HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> accepted
these Offers without the least Reluctancy.</P>
<P>As She was approaching the City of <HI>Musco</HI> with
a most magnificent Train. <HI>Demetrius</HI> her pretend∣ed
Son, met her at five or six Miles distance from
the City, and as soon as he espied the Coach where∣in
she was, dismounted, and came up to salute
her on foot and bare-headed. At their Meeting,
after the most tender Expressions, he shewed her
all the Marks of Respect due from a Son to his
Mother in a private Condition, and as he reveren∣ced
her with a more than filial Duty, so she re∣ceived
him with all possible Demonstrations of a
most tender and sincere Affection, their mutual
Caresses and Embraces being accompanied with
Tears. She urg'd him several times to come into
her Coach, which he as often refused, and would
walk by, on foot and bare-headed, till the Empress
telling him that she would do the same if he did not
gratifie her in her Request, with much ado, perswaded
him to remount his Horse. Thus having condu∣cted
her to the Palace, they renewed their former
Tenderness, by Embracing and all the most sincere
Demonstrations of mutual Satisfaction in the Pre∣sence
of the whole Court. All these things being
transacted in the Face of the World, appear'd to
the People the most evident Proofs that could be
given of the reality of his Birth, as being founded
upon the publick Confession of the same Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son
<PB N="30" REF="148"/>
that bare him; so that the <HI>Russians</HI> seem'd so ge∣nerally
satisfied concerning the Reality of his
Extraction, that by the common Consent of
the whole Nation, it was put beyond all que∣stion.</P>
<P>But <HI>Demetrius</HI> had not many Months enjoyed
the Royal Dignity and the Affections of his Subjects,
before the Chief of the Nobility (who had always
entertained some Jealousies concerning the Legality
of his Title and Extraction) began to perceive his
manner of Life to be far different from that of the
Great Dukes, his Predecessors; some of the most
refined among them, discerning in his whole Beha∣viour
a certain Lightness, not bearing the least pro∣portion
to the Grandeur of his High Station; and
tho' they knew him to be endowed with a ready
Wit, and a sufficient Stock of Courage, yet had
they observed in all his Transactions, but a very
slender share of Judgment, especially in the Ma∣nagement
of Publick Affairs relating to the Em∣pire.
The Common People, whose Judgment
seldom reaches further than the out-side of things,
having observed his Habit, Manners and Gestures, to
be wholly Foreign, concluded his Inclinations to be
the same. For he frequently used to appear in
<HI>Polish</HI> and other Foreign Habits, he seldom bathed,
and scarce ever slept after Dinner, according to
the general Custom of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> he would
carry his Dogs along with him into the <HI>Muscovite</HI>
Churches, he would eat Calves Flesh, and not
bow to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> all which being abominable
to the <HI>Russians,</HI> a People superstitious to a degree
of Madness, contributed not a little to the Hatred
which the Populacy conceived against his Person.
But what most enflamed both the Nobility and
People was, that they saw their immense Treasures
wasted in a few Months, among his Players, Para∣sites,
and Mimicks, who made it their whole Busi∣ness
to flatter and encourage him in his Debauche∣ries,
to which he was naturally inclined; which
made him neglect the Management of Publick
<PB N="31" REF="148"/>
Affairs and commit the Administration of Justice
to Foreigners. They saw the Jesuits erect most
magnificent Churches and Dwelling-places, and
the Great Duke himself, not only to follow the
<HI>Romish</HI> Perswasion, but also publickly to despise
the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, and to endeavour to introduce
the <HI>Latin;</HI> by all which he drew upon himself
the Scorn of the Nobility and the Hatred of the
People.</P>
<P>But nothing contributed so much to his Destru∣ction,
as his final Resolution of Marrying a <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick; <HI>Demetrius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me∣triu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> as we have mentioned be∣fore,

betwixt them, That after his Accession to
the Crown of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> he should many the Wey∣wode
of <HI>Sendomiria</HI>'s Daughter, and introduce the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion into that Empire. No
sooner had <HI>Demetrius</HI> ascended the Throne, but as
he discharged his Promise, in reference to the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI>
Clergy, unto whom he gave publickly all the
Encouragement and Protection he could, much
more than was consistent with his real Interest;
so he resolv'd both to gratifie his Passion, and to
acquit himself of his Word to the Weywode, in
regard of the fair <HI>Marina.</HI></P>
<P>There were not a few of his <HI>Muscovian Boyars</HI>
(among whom <HI>Bosman</HI> was the Chief) who being
entirely devoted to his Interest, took the Liberty to
remonstrate to him how little suitable these Mea∣sures
he took, especially in respect of his Marriage,
and the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, were to the present
State of his Affairs; they represented to him, That
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> being addicted to their own Reli∣gion
to the highest degree of Superstition, had al∣ways
ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tained a mortal Hatred against those of

Marriage, but to chuse their Spouses among their

against their most Ancient Customs, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
contrary to the general Inclinations of the People,
they would soon be prevailed upon to give ear to
the Suggestions of his Enemies, who would not
fail to make use of these specious Pretences to alie∣nate
the Hearts of the People from him, to his
Destruction. But <HI>Demetrius</HI> was so far from being
convinced by these Reasons, tho' never so solid,
that on the contrary he persisted in his former Re∣solution
of marrying <HI>Marina</HI> the Daughter of the
Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria.</HI></P>
<P>If we curiously reflect upon the Course of Hu∣mane

had been done partly with a Design to make use of
this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> as a fit Instrument, to revenge up∣on
the Family of <HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> the treacherous
Cruelties committed by him against the two Sons
of the Grand Duke <HI>John Basilovits;</HI> partly to avoid
the Fury of the Multitude, who, he fear'd, would
have involved him in the same Ruin with the Fa∣mily
of the <HI>Goudenou</HI>'s; but that he knew him to
be an Impostor, he himself (as they all knew)
having had the management of the Funeral Obse∣quies
of the Body of the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who
was certainly murder'd at <HI>Vgletz.</HI> That therefore,
they should not be longer imposed upon by this Up∣start
Counterfeit, but take such measures as might
most effectually secure their Religion, and Govern∣ment,
and the Lives of themselves and their Fa∣milies
from that imminent Danger which threat∣ned
the whole Empire, with an unavoidable Ruin,
if not prevented by their Prudence and Courage.</P>
<P>This Declaration of <HI>Zuski</HI> had so powerful an
Influence over all those that were present, that it
was unanimously agreed, that this Impostor should
be sent to the other World with the first Opportu∣nity.</P>
<P>But the main thing which rendred their Design
very difficult, if not quite impracticable, was his
<HI>Polish</HI> Guards, and other foreign Auxiliaries; To
remove this Obstacle, it was cunningly insinuated
to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> by some that were near his Person,
that the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> could not but be extreamly
sensible of the Mistrust he shew'd of them, in com∣mitting
the Guard of his Person, rather to the
<HI>Poles,</HI> and other foreign Auxiliaries, than to his
own Natural Subjects, who had given so lately the
most real Demonstrations of their Zeal and Affe∣ction
for his Person and Government; that they
must needs look with an ill Eye upon these Fo∣reigners,
as being the Cause of their being thus neg∣lected

to Sacrifice their Lives, and all what was dear
to them, whenever he would be pleased to make
use of their Service. <HI>Demetrius</HI> thus unwarily,
suffering himself to be Cajol'd into an Opinion of
their Stedfastness to his Service, being deluded by
this outward shew of their Affection to him, re∣solved
wholly to rely upon the Fidelity of his Sub∣jects,
and contrary to the Advice of all his Friends,
dismissed both his foreign Guards and Auxiliaries.</P>
<P>The Conspirators having thus surmounted the
main Obstacle, and being encouraged by this hap∣py
Success, began by degrees to communicate their
Design to others; and, after they had drawn a
considerable Number of Accomplices into the Con∣spiracy,
concerted measures, how to put the in∣tended
Assassination in execution. But many be∣ing
made privy to the Design, it was not carried
on so secretly, but that <HI>Demetrius</HI> got scent of it,
who having caused some of the Accomplices to be
apprehended, and Tortured, they discovered the
whole Plot to have been projected and managed by
<HI>Basili-zuski.</HI></P>
<P>He being soon apprehended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con∣spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acy dis∣covered.</NOTE> and having at the
first sight of the Rack, confessed the whole Truth,
was condemned to lose his Head.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> being now too late convinced of his
Mistake of dismissing his foreign Guards, call'd a
Cabinet Council of his most intimate Friends, to
consult with them concerning the present Emer∣gency
of his Affairs, who were unanimously of O∣pinion,
that he should not spare any of the Heads
of this Conspiracy, but by bringing them all to
condign Punishment, would strike such a Terror
into the rest, as not to dare for the future to em∣barque
in such ill Designs. They represented to
him, how that <HI>Zuski</HI> being by his Mothers side al∣ly'd
to the Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and a Man of
a very aspiring Temper, did without question aim
at the Crown, and therefore it behoved him to se∣cure
himself against so dangerous a Rival, now
Fortune had put it into his Hands, and he had the
<PB N="35" REF="152"/>
fairest in the World of putting an End to his Am∣bition,
without the least blame of Injustice. But
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> as if hurried on by some fatal Stupidi∣ty
to his own Destiny, was for chusing the milder
Way; and, when <HI>Zuski</HI> was upon the Scaffold,
ready to receive the fatal Blow, not only sent him
his Pardon, but soon after received him into his
particular Favour, vainly imagining to engage him
thereby to espouse his Interest for the future.</P>
<P>For, <HI>Basili-Zuski</HI> was so far from acknowledging
the Benefit received at his Hands, that on the con∣trary,
his Ambition being now back'd by Revenge, he
fully resolved to encompass his Design, and to find
out means to dispatch this Impostor, in spite of all
the Obstacles that might fall in his way. For which
Reason he invited the most Eminent <HI>Knez</HI> and <HI>Boy∣ars,</HI>
whom he knew to be of his Party, to his
House, and having again represented to them the
present dangerous Condition of the Empire under
the Counterfeit <HI>Demetrius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A second Conspiracy against <HI>Demetri∣us.</HI></NOTE> who had introduced
Heresie, and trampled both upon the Laws and Re∣ligion
of their Ancestors. That it would be un∣becoming
their Courage to see themselves thus a∣bused
by an Impostor imposed upon them by the
<HI>Poles,</HI> who would, if not soon prevented, before
long make <HI>Muscovy</HI> a Province of <HI>Poland;</HI> But that,
as he was ready to sacrifice once more his Life, and
what else was dearest to him for the preservation of
his native Country, so he did not question their
chearful Concurrence and Assistance in a matter,
from whence depended the Welfare both of them∣selves
and their Posterity. The whole Assembly,
after having given their hearty Thanks to <HI>Zuski</HI> for
his Zeal in the common Cause, solemnly promised
to assist him to the utmost of their Power in his
laudable Design, and to be ready at hand, when∣ever
he should meet with a favourable Opportunity
of putting it in Execution; There were not a few
among them, who were of Opinion, that the Ty∣rant
ought to be dispatch'd immediately, and that
Delays of this nature, did often prove dangerous;
<PB N="36" REF="153"/>
but the Arguments of the wiser Sort prevail'd, by
whose Advice the Execution of it was delay'd, till
the Celebrating of the Nuptials of <HI>Demetrius</HI> with
<HI>Marina.</HI> There were several pregnant Reasons al∣ledged
for this Delay: Considering that they had
not all their Friends ready at hand, who in the
mean while, under pretence of assisting at the
Nuptial Solemnity might meet all together in the
City of <HI>Musco,</HI> without the least Suspicion; be∣sides
that, whilst they were at Court, taken up
with their Jollities, they might with the less Diffi∣culty
put their Design in execution. There was
also another Reason no less prevailing than the rest,
which was, that after the arrival of the Bride, they
were in hopes to recover the Crown Jewels, which
were sent to her as a Present into <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Demetrius,</HI> soon after his Coronation had
sent a most splendid Embassy to the King and Com∣monwealth
of <HI>Poland,</HI> to conclude a League de∣fensive
and offensive with that Crown, and to de∣sire
the King's Consent, to marry the Lady <HI>Mari∣na</HI>
his Vassal, the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria</HI>'s Daugh∣ter.
The King of <HI>Poland</HI> having deferr'd his Re∣solution
as to the proposed Alliance, till the meet∣ing
of the next Dyet, did without much difficulty
consent to the Marriage of <HI>Demetrius</HI> with <HI>Marina.</HI>
But to give her the most real demonstrations of
his Passion, and to acquit himself in part of those
Obligations he had received from her Father's hands,
who had been the main Instrument in his Advance∣ment
to the Imperial Dignity, he now was possess'd
of, he sent to his Admir'd <HI>Marina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> the greatest
part of the Crown Jewels of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as the first
Pledge of his Constancy, and to make her the more
sensible, what share he intended her both in his
Heart and Crown.</P>
<P>It is no difficult matter to guess, that <HI>Marina,</HI>
who was Naturally of a very haughty Temper,
being Courted at so high a rate, was not long in
Suspence, whether she should comply with her Fa∣ther's
Inclinations, and the Desires of her Lover,
<PB REF="153"/>
<PB REF="154"/>
<FIGURE>
<P>Marina</P>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="37" REF="154"/>
so that within few days after, the Nuptial Ceremo∣nies
were performed by proxy in the City of <HI>Cra∣cow,</HI>
with all the Pomp imaginable in the presence
of the King, and a considerable number of other
Persons of the first Rank. After some time spent
in Feastings, Balls, and other such like Divertise∣ments,
the Bride, after having taken her Leave of
the King, and the whole Court of <HI>Poland,</HI> set out from
<HI>Cracow</HI> towards the latter end of <HI>January,</HI> in the
Year 1606, being accompany'd by the Ambassa∣dors
of <HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> by Duke <HI>Constantine
Wisnowiski,</HI> and her Father, besides a great many
other Persons of eminent Quality in <HI>Poland,</HI> on her
Journey to the City of <HI>Musco;</HI> where being met
at some Miles distance by the whole Court, and in
great Splendor, with the ringing of Bells, and
the discharge of the great Cannons of the Castle,
through an infinite number of People, and con∣ducted
to the Palace Royal; she was there received
by <HI>Demetrius,</HI> with all the highest demonstrations
of Joy, that could be given by the most passionate
Lover in the World.</P>
<P>A few days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> they were married by the
Patriarch, and the Church Ceremonies being end∣ed,
were reconducted with all the Pomp imagina∣ble
to the Palace Royal, where the succeeding
Night was spent in Feasting, Dancing, Masque∣rades,
and other such like Diversions, with a Mag∣nificence
suitable to the present Occasion, and the
Grandeur of so Illustrious a Company. The same
were continued for several following days and
nights, with all the Excess, Profuseness and Pomp
that could be invented, till the sixteenth day of
<HI>May,</HI> the fatal Eve of the ensuing Tragedy, which
put an end to the Life of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and the
Greatness and Enjoyment of <HI>Marina.</HI></P>
<P>For as we have mentioned before, <HI>Knez Basili-Zuski,</HI>
and his Accomplices, having delay'd the
Execution of their Design till the Nuptials of <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
had in the mean while, by the assistance of
his two Brothers, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Bogdan,</HI> and some other
<PB N="38" REF="155"/>
<HI>Muscovian</HI> Lords, engag'd in the Conspiracy, con∣veyed
some thousands of Men, by degrees, and
unobserved into the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> to be ready at
hand, at certain places, appointed for that Pur∣pose,
as occasion should require. Being thus prepar'd,
they pitch'd upon the sixteenth of <HI>May,</HI> which be∣ing
a Day appointed for an Extraordinary Feast in
the Castle, was consequently spent in all sorts of
Jollities and Divertisments; the Guards being even
dismissed upon this extraordinary Occasion, from
their Duty: So that, every thing conspiring to fa∣cilitate
the Design of the Conspirators, it was re∣solved
among them, that at the closing of the
Feast, when the whole Court should be buried in
strong Liquor, and Sleep, should be the beginning
of the Tragedy they intended to act the next
Morning. The very same Night there happned a
certain Accident, which had been likely to have
once more spoil'd their whole Design.</P>
<P>For a certain young Fellow who was privy to the
Conspiracy, drinking with some of the Guards,
and being elevated by the Force of the strong Li∣quor,
had unwarily let fall some Words in his Dis∣course
concerning this intended Conspiracy▪ where∣upon,
being seized and brought before <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
he order'd him immediately to be put to the Rack,
to extort from him the whole truth of the Design.
But some of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Lords, who were con∣cern'd
in the Plot, and in the most imminent Dan∣ger▪
that could be of being discovered, told the
Grand Duke, that it was easily to be seen, that the
young Fellow's Brains were intoxicated by the
Strength of the <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and that therefore it
would be a Madness to make the least Reflection
upon what he said while he was drunk. <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
hurried on by his malignant Fate to his approaching
Destiny, being also hot-headed with the great quan∣tity
of Wine he had drank that Day, followed the
deceitful Advice of his mortal Enemies, and dis∣miss'd
the young Fellow for time, with an Inten∣tion
to have him further examined the next day,
<PB N="39" REF="155"/>
without taking the least Precaution against the At∣tempts
of his Enemies.</P>
<P>But the Conspirators had no sooner received In∣telligence
of what had passed in the Castle, and how
narrowly they had escaped being discovered, imme∣diately
prepared themselves to execute their Design,
without any further Delay. For this purpose they
had before Break of Day possess'd themselves of
the most considerable Parts and Avenues of the Ci∣ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrecti∣on against <HI>Deme∣trius.</HI></NOTE>
which done, they caused the great Bell (the
common Signal of Alarms) to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oll'd, and most
horrible Out-cries to be made in the Market-place
and adjacent Streets, that the <HI>Poles,</HI> who were
lately come along with the Grand Dutchess, were in
Arms, with an Intention to Massacre all the Inha∣bitants
of the City. The Citizens being soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
waked by those dreadful Apprehensions, with the
Assistance of the Conspirators, who had dispe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
themselves into those parts of the Town where
the <HI>Poles</HI> were lodged▪ fell instantly upon the <HI>Pole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
in their Quarters, who being all drunk and asleep
in their Beds, they kill'd most of them before they
could be sensible of their Danger.</P>
<P>The Beginning of their projected Design having
thus succeeded according to Wish, <HI>Knez Basili-Zuski</HI>
at the Head of this Party and a vast num∣ber
of People, having by the Massacre of the <HI>Poles</HI>
secured themselves against all Opposition, marched
directly with their Scymeters in their Hands towards
the Castle, where they found every thing in a profound
Silence and Security, every Soul there being over∣whelmed
with Sleep, Weariness and strong Liquor,
to that Degree, that the Conspirators were advan∣ced
to the Gates of the Royal Palace before they
took the Alarm within. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> being one of
the first that awaken'd by the Noise and Out-cries
of those that were Massacring all they met within
the Castle, got to one of the Windows, and having
soon understood the true Meaning of this Tumult, he
call'd to <HI>Bosman</HI> and some other Gentlemen of his
Bed-Chamber, that were near at hand, who havi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="40" REF="156"/>
taken what Weapons they could meet with, on a
sudden, endeavoured to stop the Fury of those
who press'd forward to enter the Great Duke's
Apartment, <HI>Demetrius</HI> himself appearing among
them, arm'd with a Halbard, wherewith he di∣spatched
some of the most forward of the Conspi∣rators;
but some of them being provided with
Pistols and Muskets, they discharged so furiously
upon the Great Duke and his Company, that most
of them being slain, (among whom was <HI>Bosman,</HI>
who was stabb'd with a Dagger,) <HI>Demetrius</HI> was
forced to retire, and being pursued from Chamber
to Chamber, at last threw himself out of the
Window, down into one of the Courts,
from whence, tho' sorely bruised, he at last got
into the Fortress of the Castle guarded by <HI>Mus∣covites.</HI></P>
<P>The Conspirators being enraged at their having
miss'd their Prey, fell a ransacking the Great
Dukes Apartment, and forcing their Way with
their Scymeters thro' the Bodies of a few Attend∣ants
that were left, entred the Grand Duke's Bed-Chamber,
whither all the <HI>Polish</HI> Ladies of Quality
were retired, and at the Approach of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
appeared half dead and immovable, like Statues, for
fear, not being able to utter one Word, unless it
were a certain ancient Lady, who somewhat more
confident than the rest, by reason of her great Age,
answered the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Lords that were enquiring
where the Great Dutchess was? <HI>That at the begin∣ning
of the Tumult she had found means, to get away
as she believed, to her Father's Palace.</HI> Having
search'd all over the Room, and not being able
to find her, they were resolved to try whether they
could put Life into the Ladies, and restore to them
that Natural Motion they had lost by this sudden Con∣sternation,
and so to work they went, every one
catching hold of her he liked best; and thus having
satisfied their brutish Lust, they were going to leave
the Room, in further Pursuit after <HI>Demetrius.</HI> It is to
be observed that among all the Ladies that were
<PB N="41" REF="156"/>
there, but two escaped their Violences; the first
was the Lady Palatine of <HI>Lamoc,</HI> we mentiond be∣fore,
secured more by her Wrinkles and Grey Hair
than out of any Respect to her Person; and ano∣ther
Lady that sate very sick in a large Elbow-Chair,
One of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Lords, as they were Just go∣ing
out, hapning to cast his Eyes that way, observ∣ed
some Motion behind that Chair, and being cu∣rious
to know the Meaning of it, advanced that
Way, where having pulled up the Hangings he dis∣covered
the poor affrighted <HI>Marina,</HI> who as she
was of an extraordinary Presence of Mind, look'd
upon them with so Majestick an Air, that they
all withdrew without offering any further Vio∣lence.</P>
<P>By this time▪ the Conspirators being advertised
that <HI>Demetrius</HI> had saved himself among the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
that guarded the Fortress of the Castle, they
march'd thither and attack'd the Fort with the ut∣most
Fury; but these within being encouraged by
the Presence of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who notwithstanding
the Violent Bruises occasioned by his leaping out of
the Widow, fought in this Extremity like a Lion,
with a Resolution rather to die with his Scymeter
in his Hand than to be exposed to the Scorn of his
Enemies, they were repulsed with great Slaughter;
but their Strength increasing with their Number,
they renew'd the Assault several times, but were as
often repulsed, till the Garrison by their Threats
was at last prevailed upon to surrender the unfor∣tunate
<HI>Demetrius</HI> into their Hands.</P>
<P>From thence they led him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deme∣trius</HI> led in Triumph.</NOTE> after they had put a
ragged Coat about him, thro' the Streets of the
City in Triumph, under the Imprecations and
Scorns of the Rabble, who pointed Fingers
into his very Eyes, pluck'd him by the Nose
and Chin, asking him whether he was now <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
or <HI>Grisko?</HI> All which he bore with a most
admirable Constancy, not so much as uttering one
Word, and scarce changing his Countenance. But
coming near the Market-place, and perceiving a
<PB N="42" REF="157"/>
great number of the dead Bodies of the <HI>Poles</HI> slain
by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> wallowing in their own Blood,
he could not refrain from shedding of Tears, ex∣pressing
a greater Sense of their Sufferings than his
own; telling them, that if they would but have
spared his Friends, he should not have grumbled
at his own Fate, tho' perhaps the most severe, and
not to be parallel'd in History, as being their lawful
Sovereign, and Youngest Son to their Grand Duke
<HI>John Basilovits;</HI> for the Confirmation of which he
would appeal to his Mother.</P>
<P><HI>The People being not a little startled at his reso∣lute
Behaviour, began to abate of their former
Fierceness, and having sent Knez</HI> Basili-Zuski <HI>to
the Empress Dowager, to learn from her own
Mouth the whole Truth of the Matter, he return'd
soon after with this Answer;</HI> That the Empress
Dowager, his pretended Mother, had declared to
him, upon the Cross, that he was no Son of hers, and
what she had done before, in acknowledging him as
such, had been done, partly to obtain her Freedom,
and partly to revenge her self upon the Family of
<HI>Boris Goudenou</HI> for the Murther of her Son <HI>De∣metrius.</HI></P>
<P>This Answer having been soon spread among the
People, a certain <HI>Muscovite</HI> thronging thro' the
Croud that surrounded <HI>Demetrius,</HI> with his Pistol
ready cock'd in his Hand, and coming up close to
him, <HI>Thou infamous Traitor,</HI> said he, <HI>take the Re∣ward
of thy Imposture,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deme∣trius <HI>kill'd.</HI></NOTE> and so shot him thro' the
Heart that he fell dead the same Instant at his Feet,
those that stood nearest, wounding the dead Car∣cass
with their Scymeters and Pikes, and after they
had stript and mangled it so as scarce to be known,
dragg'd it thro' the Streets of the City, and com∣mitted
all manner of Barbarities upon the dead
Body of the same Person, whom within a few
Months before they both dreaded and adored.</P>
<P>Thus was the Splendor of the Nuptials darkned
by the fatal End of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who after he had
scarce tasted the Sweets of a Diadem, and the Joys
<PB N="43" REF="157"/>
of a fair Bride, was snatch'd away from both by
the same Fate, that, not many Months before, had
exalted him to this sublime Station, on pur∣pose
as it seems, to make his fall the more conspi∣cuous.</P>
<P>It is a controverted Point to this day, not only
among a great many of the <HI>Russians,</HI> but especially
betwixt the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> whether he was an
Impostor or not. The <HI>Swedes,</HI> who were engag'd
on <HI>Boris Goudenou</HI>'s and <HI>Basili-Zuski</HI>'s side, stre∣nuously
maintain the first, and for the Confir∣mation
of this their Opinion, alledge, that it was
put beyond all question by the Evidence of the
Empress Dowager, and <HI>Basili-Zuski</HI> himself, who
managed the Funeral Solemnities of the true <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
slain at <HI>Ʋgletz,</HI> and asserted that he was certainly
murthered by the Assassins sent for that purpose by
<HI>Boris Goudenou;</HI> and that the owning of this Im∣postor
to be the true <HI>Demetrius</HI> by <HI>Zuski,</HI> proceeded
from his fear of being Massacred by the People, as
that of the Empress owes its Origin to the Obliga∣tion
she had to him for her Liberty and the Satisfa∣ction
she received of being revenged of the <HI>Bori∣sian</HI>
Family. The <HI>Poles,</HI> on the other hand, who
sided with this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> assert the contrary,
affirming, that what the <HI>Swedes</HI> relate of him, is
founded meerly upon Hear-say▪ suggested by his
Enemies, on purpose to encompass their Designs
of snatching the Crown from the true Family of
the Great Duke <HI>Basilovits;</HI> That the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who
were not concern'd so nearly in the Matter as the
<HI>Poles,</HI> and that not till several years after the Fray
was begun, ought not to be look'd upon as com∣petent
Judges of this Controversie; That it would
be ridiculous to suppose, that so many Persons of
Quality in <HI>Poland,</HI> and the King himself could be
thus imposed upon; that it was not very likely,
that the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> would have thus
engag'd in his Interest, and promised him his
Daughter in Marriage, if, besides the great Resem∣blance
he had with that <HI>Demetrius</HI> at <HI>Ʋgletz,</HI> he
<PB N="44" REF="158"/>
had not had very evident Proofs of the reality of
his Extraction. That the first Declaration of the
Empress <HI>Dowager,</HI> was without question real, and
that the pretended denial made afterwards to <HI>Ba∣sili-Zuski,</HI>
concerning this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> was extorted
from her by Fear; besides that, it was only found∣ed
upon the Faith of <HI>Basili-Zuski,</HI> who, as it suffi∣ciently
appear'd afterwards; was his Rival for the
Crown of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and succeeded him in the Em∣pire.</P>
<P>But we must pursue our Tragedy, which did not
end with the Death of <HI>Demetrius;</HI> For, there be∣ing
a considerable number of <HI>Poles</HI> quartered in the
more remote Parts of the City, who being involv∣ed
in Drink and Sleep, had not as yet heard the
least Tidings of what had past in and about the
Castle; and the <HI>Muscovites</HI> fearing, not without
Reason, that if they should take the Alarm upon so
surprising an Occasion, they would sell their Lives
at a very dear rate, they resolved to draw them into
the Trap, before they could have any notice of
this Accident. For this purpose, certain Messen∣gers
were dispatch'd with counterfeit Orders from
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> to appear forthwith in the Castle with∣out
their Arms, the Grand Duke being resolved,
that at the Day of a general Rejoycing, nothing
of Terror should appear at his Nuptials. The <HI>Poles,</HI>
not suspecting the concealed Fraud of this deceit∣ful
Message, came forth without their Arms, thus
tamely exposing themselves to the Slaughter,
which was executed upon them with a more
than barbarous Cruelty, very few escaping the hands
of the bloody <HI>Muscovites,</HI> except some Gentlemen
of Quality, who having scatter'd some Money a∣mong
the Rabble, had thereby an Opportunity
given them to gather into a small Body, and so
hew'd their Way thro' their Enemies, till they came
to the Palace of <HI>George Mniszeck,</HI> Weywode of
<HI>Sendomiria,</HI> Father-in-Law to the Great Dutchess,
where was also the Duke <HI>Wisnowiski,</HI> and some o∣ther
<HI>Polish</HI> Lords, who having opened their way
<PB N="45" REF="158"/>
by their Scymiters to this Palace, which was pretty
strong, were resolved to defend it to the utmost,
and at least not to sell their Lives at a cheap rate.
Neither was it long before they saw themselves sur∣rounded
on all sides by an infinite number of their
Enemies, who with great Fury attack'd them on
all sides, but with little Success, for, the <HI>Poles</HI>
having no other Sanctuary left them, fought like
desperate Men, and as often as they were attack'd
by the Enemies, drove them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> back with a great
Slaughter, so that at last their Fury being quell'd
by the difficulty of the Enterprize, and the Blood
of their Comerades, they thought fit to leave the
<HI>Poles,</HI> who thus saved themselves by their own
Bravery, by giving such Testimonies of their
Courage to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> as made them sufficient∣ly,
sensible that if the rest of the <HI>Poles</HI> had been alive,
they would not have rid themselves at so cheap a
rate of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and that they were more be∣holding
to the Conduct of <HI>Zuski,</HI> than their own
Courage for the Success of this Conspiracy. To
revenge themselves of the Affront received at the be∣forementioned
Palace, they fell upon the Jewellers,
and other foreign Merchants that were lodged up
and down the City, of whom they kill'd the great∣est
part, some few escaping into the Houses of the
Ambassadors of the several Nations, to whom they
belonged, where, by the Intercession of the Lead∣ing
Men of the Conspiracy, they found a Sanctu∣ary
against the most barbarous Fury of the enrag'd
Multitude.</P>

<P>THE next following night, having put an end
to the Massacre and Tumult, the Boyars and
other Lords of the Empire met two days after, to
concert measures about the Election of a new Em∣perour.
The deference they all paid to <HI>Zuski,</HI> as
the Contriver and Chief Leader of the whole En∣terprize,
made them, after he had received the
Thanks of the whole Assembly, first address them∣selves
to him, and desire his Opinion in the pre∣sent
Emergency of the State.</P>
<P><HI>Basili-Zuski,</HI> who beforehand had sufficient
Opportunity to sound their Inclinations, know∣ing
that the major Part were at his Devotion, and
not questioning but that▪ the rest, in acknowledg∣ment
of his late Service, would also, without much
difficulty, be brought over to his Party, took this
Opportunity to tell them; That he was over-joy∣ed
to see the same Satisfaction in their Faces, which
they had testified by their Words, in reference to
the late Enterprize, contrived and executed by his
directions; That, as the Greatness of the <HI>Russian</HI>
Empire was chiefly owing to the extraordinary
Feats of that renowned Emperour, <HI>John Basilovits,</HI>
so the present ill posture of their Affairs must be
attributed to the Perfidiousness, Murders, and U∣surpation
of <HI>Boris Goudenou:</HI> That, to deliver
them from this Usurper, and to revenge upon him
<PB N="47" REF="159"/>
the Death of the two Sons of <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> he
had been prevail'd upon to acknowledge the last
Great Duke for the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and rightful
Heir of the Crown. But this Impostor, having
trampled both upon their Laws and Religion, he
had twice ventur'd his Life to rescue them from
his unsupportable Tyranny; and since now God
Almighty had bless'd their projected Design with
Success, by the assistance of their Zeal and Courage
for the common Cause, whereby the Royal Line
being▪ extinguished, they were now in the qua∣ity
of a Free People, unto whom was devolved
the whole Right of Election, it was their Duty
not to let slip so favourable an opportunity of re∣establishing
their Affairs, according to the true an∣tient
Constitution of that Great Monarchy, which
they ought to look upon as the only solid Founda∣tion,
whereupon to build so vast a Structure. That,
as for his part, he was very ready to assist them
with his Counsel, and such Observations as he had
opportunity to make during the space of thirty or
forty Years, in the most considerable Employments
in the Kingdom; being sensible that their future Fe∣licity
would depend from the Choice they were
now going to make of a Person fit to fill the Throne
of this vast Empire. That (if they would follow his
Advice) a Person of mean Extraction would by no
means be qualified to answer their Expectation,
and to command so many Persons of an eminent
Rank, who would not without Reluctancy sub∣mit
to his Commands, or at least claim a Preroga∣tive
to controul his Orders, and to have a share in
the Administration of the Government. That a
young Prince would be insufficient to undergo
the Burthen, at the present juncture of Time, that
it was to be fear'd he would be more mindful of
his Pleasures, than the Troubles and Fatigues of so
great a Charge, and by neglecting his Duty, and
laying the Weight thereof upon other Men's Should∣ers,
make their present Condition worser, instead of
mending it. That therefore they had no other way
<PB N="48" REF="160"/>
left them at this time, than to cast their Eyes upon
a Person in the Commonwealth, fitly qualified for
the Management of so great an Empire, at the worst
of Times. That, to answer this End, they ough to
chuse One advanced in Years, of an Illustrious Birth,
and well vers'd, by many Years Experience in
the Management of publick Affairs; one of approved
Valour and Conduct, measuring his Interest by that
of the State, and constantly adhering to their Reli∣gion
and most ancient Customs; From such a one
it is (concluded he) that we may with Reason ex∣pect
a Redress of those Mischiefs which have in the
late Reigns overwhelmed this Empire, and see it
restored to its former flourishing Condition.</P>
<P>There were very few in the Assembly, who did
not perceive that <HI>Basili-Zuski,</HI> in the Description
he had given of his Prince to fill the Throne of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> had pointed directly at himself; They
knew him to be descended of one of the most illu∣strious
Families in the whole Empire, and by his
long and many Services, both in Peace and War,
trained up in the Management of the State, so that
meeting, in his Person, with all the necessary Quali∣fications
for so great a Trust, after some days De∣bate,
by the Suffrages of the Nobility, he was elected
and proclaimed Emperour of <HI>Russia,</HI> in the Month
of <HI>June,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Basili Zus∣ki</HI> made Emperour.</NOTE> in the Year 1606, about a Month after
the Massacre of <HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Basili-Zuski,</HI> being thus placed in the Throne,
was soon after Crowned with the usual Solemnities:
The first thing he did, was to send <HI>Marina,</HI> with all
her Moveables she brought along with her out of
<HI>Poland</HI> (except the Crown Jewels) to her Father's
Palace, where he placed a strong Guard, under
pretence of preserving them from the Outrages of
the Common People, but in effect to observe their
Motions, and to secure them as his Prisoners, till he
saw how the Treatment the <HI>Poles</HI> had met with
in <HI>Musco</HI> would be relish'd at the Court of <HI>Sigis∣mund.</HI>
And the better to palliate the late Massacre,
he published his Declaration, stiling <HI>Demetrius</HI> an
<PB N="49" REF="160"/>
Impostor, Heretick, and Tyrant, and that the most
imminent Danger, unto which both Church and
State were reduced, under his short but unfortunate
Reign, had forced him against his Inclinations to
embark in a Design to deliver his Native Country
from Death and Confusion, which, tho' somewhat
cruel in the Execution, yet by its absolute Necessi∣ty,
Justice of the Cause, and happy Event, was
sufficiently justifiable to all the World.</P>
<P>This Sugar-plumb, tho' it was greedily swallow∣ed
by the giddy-headed Multitude, who being al∣ways
in Extreams, and fond of Novelties, shewed
their Approbation by digging up the dead Carcass of
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> which with most horrible Imprecations,
(in which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> excell most other Nations)
they burnt and threw the Ashes into the Air, yet did
it not relish so well with the <HI>Poles,</HI> but that, not∣witstanding
all his specious Pretences, they resol∣ved
to call him to a severe Account for the Barba∣rities
committed upon their Country-men.</P>
<P>Neither was it long before they met with an
Opportunity to revenge themselves, and to give
very sensible Proofs of their utmost Resentments
against <HI>Zuski,</HI> the Contriver and chief Actor of that
Tragedy. For, tho' the dead Body of the late <HI>Demetrius</HI>
was exposed to publick View for several days, it
was so mangl'd and hack'd by the Fury of the Mul∣titude,
that it was impossible to be known even by
the nearest of his Friends. Which <HI>Schacopski,</HI> the
Lord Chancellor of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and one of his most
trusty Friends having got notice of, he made his
Escape with two or three more whom he knew to
be absolutely in his Interest, to the City of <HI>Putti∣woll,</HI>
which had always stood vigorous for <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
from the first time he entred <HI>Muscovy</HI> with
an Army. As they were travelling upon the Road
at some distance from the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> they
made it their Business to spread it about the Coun∣try,
that <HI>Demetrius</HI> was not dead, that the People
during the Tumult had apprehended and massacred
another in his place, he having at the very begin∣ning
<PB N="50" REF="161"/>
of the Disorder saved himself by Flight.
They shewed to several Inn-keepers, the Great Seal
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> telling them at their Departure, that
in a little time they should know what a great
Guest they had entertain'd that Night. They were
also very profuse of their Gold, all which serving for
a Confirmation of what they had heard them say be∣fore,
they took it as an undoubted Truth; and the
more they were enjoin'd Secre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, the more eager
were they in Whispering it about among their
Friends, so that in a little time it became currant
News in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> where it having been
encouraged and improved by some secret Friends of
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> there was scarce a Meeting where this
surprizing News was not the chief Subject of their
Discourse, every one judging of the Matter accor∣ding
to his own Sentiment.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>George Schacopski</HI> was, with
his Friends, arriv'd at <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> from whence ha∣ving
immediately dispatch'd a Messenger into <HI>Po∣land,</HI>
with Letters to the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria</HI>'s
Lady, wherein he gave her a full Relation of the
Conspiracy form'd by <HI>Zuski</HI> and his Party against
her Son-in-Law, but that by a peculiar Providence he
had saved himself in time by Flight, and was retir'd
to a Place of Security, from whence he would sud∣denly
return at the Head of a considerable Army
to revenge the Death of his Friends upon these
Traitors. That her Husband also had by his Va∣lour
escaped the Fury of the enraged Multitude,
and remained in good Health in the City of <HI>Mus∣co;</HI>
and that in a little time he hoped to give her
a more ample Account of the further Success of
their Affairs.</P>
<P>Having sent away the Messenger with these Di∣spatches,
he immediately demanded Audience, in
the Great Duke, <HI>Demetrius,</HI> his Master's Name,
which being soon granted, he appear'd in the As∣sembly
the next day, where having highly extoll'd
the Zeal of the Citizens of <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> in having
been the first that espoused the Interest of <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="161"/>
in the very Infancy of his Affairs, and their
Constancy in persevering ever since stedfast in
their Loyalty to their Natural Prince; he told them
how <HI>Zuski,</HI> the present Usurper, prompted by his
immensurable Ambition of putting the Crown up∣on
his own Head, had with his party form'd a
Conspiracy against the Life of the Grand Duke
<HI>Demetrius;</HI> that, to facilitate their Hellish Design,
they had massacred a great number of innocent
Persons in their Beds, against all the Laws of
Hospitality, and afterwards intended to have done
the same to the Great Duke himself, whom they
intended to have surprized in his Palace; but ha∣ving
been stopt for a little while by the Resistance
made by his trusty Servants, he had by a peculiar
Providence of God Almighty, got into his Stables,
where being furnished with some of his swiftest
Horses, he was with a few of his particular Friends
escap'd the Fury of the People, and had directed his
Course to <HI>Poland,</HI> from whence he soon hoped
to return with so considerable a Force as to be
able to reduce his rebellious Subjects to Obedience.
He told them that he had recommended to his Care
the Affairs of the whole Empire in his Absence;
for the Confirmation of which, he produced the
Great Seal of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> and that he had given him
a most particular Charge to satisfie his faithful Citi∣zens
of <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> that he was alive and in a place
of Security. He further added, that having had
such constant and evident Proofs of their Loyalty,
he had, in Obedience to his Master's Commands,
taken the direct Road to this City, to discharge
himself of his Commission, and to give them fresh
Assurances of the Grand Duke's Favour which they
had at this time the best Opportunity in the World
to improve to their Advantage, if, as they had
done heretofore, they would by their Stedfastness
shew a good Example to the other neighbouring
Cities, and acquire to themselves and their Poste∣rity
the Glory of an unshaken Loyalty to their na∣tural
Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="162"/>
The Citizens of <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> being by these speci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
Pretences soon inveigled into a Belief of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣cere
Intentions, and taking Compassion on the Mis∣fortune

espoused from the time of his first comi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
out of <HI>Poland</HI> into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> they, after having re∣turn'd
their most hearty Thanks for the Honour he
did them in putting so great a Value upon their
Services, declared unanimously that they were rea∣dy
to sacrifice their Lives and what else was dear
to them in this World, for the Interest of their
lawful Prince, and that as a Token of their Fide∣lity,
they were ready to obey his (the Lord Chan∣cellour's)
Orders, till the Great Duke himself
should be pleased to honour them with his Pre∣sence.</P>
<P>The Chancellour's Project having thus far suc∣ceeded
according to Wish,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> he dispatch'd some Mes∣sengers
to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> unto whom he represented
the Cruelty and Treachery of <HI>Zuski,</HI> and by what
good Fortune the Great Duke had escaped his
Hands, commanding them in his Name to repair at
their Rendezvous, which he had appointed near
<HI>Puttiwoll.</HI> The <HI>Cosacks</HI> being also inveigled by
the same Artifices of <HI>Schacopski,</HI> as they had always
adhered to the Interest of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> so they were
now the most forward in appearing in Arms for the
maintaining of his pretended Right; so that the
Lord Chancellour, seeing himself thus strengthned
by a considerable Party of <HI>Cosacks, Tartars,</HI> and
some <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scovites,</HI> and by the Surrender of several
other Places in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> he
obliged them to swear true Allegiance to <HI>Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣trius,</HI>
with a solemn Promise not to lay down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Arms, till they had been reveng'd of that bloody
Usurper <HI>Basili-Zuski,</HI> and restored <HI>Demetrius</HI> to the
Throne of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>It is easie to be imagined that the new Empe∣rour
was not a little Alarm'd at so unexpected
and unwelcome a piece of News;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zuski</HI> rou∣ted by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣trians.</HI></NOTE> but believing it
most for his purpose to quench the Fire in the Ashes,
<PB N="53" REF="162"/>
before it should break out into a Flame, he marched
with what Troops he could get together in haste
towards the Enemy. But these being in the mean
while reinforced by a considerable Body, under
the Command of a certain <HI>Muscovian</HI> Lord, whose
name was <HI>Isthoma,</HI> they Charged <HI>Zuski,</HI> who was
at the Head of his Troops, with so much Fury,
that they put him entirely to the rout, and remain∣ing
thus Masters of the Field, pursued him so close∣ly,
that with much ado he escaped to the City of
<HI>Musco,</HI> where he was block'd up by the Enemy,
who fortified their Camp within a Mile of the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles</HI> in the mean while had not been idle,
but having received Intelligence, that a considera∣ble
Party in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> had declared for <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
they were over-joy'd to have found so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avourable
an Opportunity to revenge upon the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> the
De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of their Countrymen, Massacred in their
Quarters, against the Laws of Nations; for which
purpose, they maintain'd a Correspondency with
<HI>Schacopski,</HI> whom they inform'd that they had found
out a certain Gentleman in <HI>Poland,</HI> not unlike in
his Person to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who intended to appear
at the Head of a considerable Army in <HI>Muscovy.</HI>
In the mean while they had got together a Body
of twelve thousand <HI>Cosacks,</HI> under the Command
of one <HI>John Polutnich,</HI> who being sent by this new
<HI>Demetrius</HI> to reinforce the Army, that lay Encam∣ped
near the Gates of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> was by
his special Commission constituted General over all
his Forces.</P>
<P>This <HI>Polutnich</HI> was a <HI>Muscovite</HI> by Birth, and now
a Soldier of Fortune; he had been bred among the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> and serv'd his Apprenticeship in Arms a∣mong
the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> where he had made himself famous
for his extraordinary Atchievments, till at last he
was taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and made a Gally Slave;
but by good Fortune rescued by the <HI>Venetians;</HI>
from thence he took his way through <HI>Poland,</HI> where
having met with this new <HI>Demetrius,</HI> he obtained
of him the Command over his whole Army; <HI>Po∣lutnich,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="163"/>
therefore having, pursuant to his Commis∣sion,
join'd the Forces before <HI>Musco,</HI> shew'd his
Orders to <HI>Isthoma,</HI> who was forced to obey, but
being extreamly disgusted at the Affront put upon
him, to see himself thus neglected, and another
to reap the fruits of his Victory; he, with ten
thousand Men, whom he had debauch'd before, and
brought over to his Party, went over to <HI>Zuski,</HI>
who receiv'd him no less than his Tutelar Angel,
to whom he was indebted for his present Deliver∣ance;
especially when he assured both him and the
People, that there was no such Man as <HI>Demetrius</HI>
at <HI>Puttiwoll;</HI> and that the whole was only a Con∣trivance
of <HI>Schacopski,</HI> who by these Intrigues in∣tended
to make himself the more Considerable.</P>
<P>The whole City being not a little over-joy'd at
these comfortable Tydings, the People as well as
the Nobility, sent their Deputies into the Camp to
<HI>Polutnich.</HI> The first desired, that they might be
admitted into the Presence of <HI>Demetrius</HI> their
Prince, and that they were ready to prostrate them∣selves
at his Feet, and to beg pardon for their past
Offences. Those of the Nobility represented to
the General, how miserably he was imposed upon
by the Artifices of <HI>Schacopski;</HI> that the true <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
whose Interest he had espoused was in the
presence of a great many Thousands slain in the
City of <HI>Musco;</HI> and therefore, whoever since had
assumed his Name, and counterfeited his Per∣son,
must needs be an Impostor, from whom
he could expect neither Honour nor Profit; That
therefore, he would be much better advised to
leave his Party, and to spare the Effusion of
Christian Blood, by acknowledging <HI>Zuski</HI> for the
lawful Sovereign of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> who would not fail
to heap upon him such Honours and Dignities, as
should be suitable to his Merits.</P>
<P><HI>Polutnich</HI> answer'd like a Man of Honour, that he
was sorry to understand that they took him to be
like <HI>Isthoma,</HI> a Traytor both to his Master and
Country; That they did him wrong in entertain∣ing
<PB N="55" REF="163"/>
so mean an Opinion of him; That, tho' he
was a Soldier of Fortune, he would never give
<HI>Demetrius</HI> the least Occasion of repenting himself
of the Trust he had put in him. That the Prince
was certainly in <HI>Poland,</HI> where he had seen and
spoke with him, and had from his own hands re∣ceived
this Commission of being General of this
Army. That if they were so nearly touch'd, as
they pretended, in their Consciences, with the Ef∣fusion
of Humane Blood, the best way to prevent
it would be, to return to their true Allegiance, and
pay to their lawful Prince due Obedience, and as
a Pledge of their future Fidelity, and of their re∣morse
for what was past, to deliver up into his
Hands the Usurper of his Crown. That this was
the only means left them to prevent these Evils,
which they dreaded, and by which they might
hope to deserve their Pardon, and to secure them∣selves,
their Wives and Children, and the whole
City from destruction.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Musco,</HI> being in no wise sa∣tisfied
with <HI>Polutnich</HI>'s Answer, which served them
for a Confirmation of what they had received from
<HI>Isthoma</HI> before, to wit; That there was no such
Man as <HI>Demetrius,</HI> either in the Camp, or any
where else; and encourag'd by the late Defection of
<HI>Isthoma;</HI> they resolved unanimously to stand by
<HI>Zuski,</HI> and not to hearken to any further Impositi∣ons,
but to treat <HI>Polutnich</HI> as an Enemy of their
Country. Pursuant to this Resolution, most of
the young Men inhabiting the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> were
put in Arms, and being join'd with such regulated
Troops as were brought over by <HI>Isthoma,</HI> they made
a furious sally with a hundred and twenty thou∣sand Men;
and, attacking the <HI>Demetrian</HI> General
on all sides in his Entrenchments, forced him to
retreat to <HI>Catuga, Zuski,</HI> after a few days spent in
modelling his Army, march'd thither in Person,
and closely besieg'd <HI>Schacopski,</HI> who so bravely de∣fended
himself against the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> that he for∣ced
them to abandon the Enterprize, and march

back to <HI>Musco,</HI> with the loss of some Thousands of
their best Men.</P>
<P>Some time was bestow'd in raising the necessary
Recruits, so that <HI>Polutnich,</HI> in the mean while,
having recovered Breath, saw himself once more
in a Condition to appear with a considerable Body
in the Field, which having afresh Alarm'd the
Great Duke, he marched once more against them,
with a very formidable Army.</P>
<P>The <HI>Demetrians,</HI> tho' much inferior in Number,
being as forward as they to come to Blows, both
Armies were drawn up in order of Battle, in a
great Plain, not many Miles from the City of <HI>Thu∣la,</HI>
and were just upon the point of Engaging one
another, when a Body of five thousand <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
which were posted in the Front of the left Wing of
the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Army, instead of attacking the
Enemy, ran over to them, all in a Body, which
having put <HI>Polutnich,</HI> and the whole Army into a
great Consternation, it was thought most advisable
to avoid fighting, and to retreat to <HI>Thula.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zuski</HI> falling in their Rear, cut off a considera∣ble
number of them, closely pursuing the rest
to the Walls of the City, which was immediately
after, surrounded by the whole Army, and attack∣ed
with all the Fury imaginable; The besieged
having in their Retreat, been forced to leave be∣hind
them all their Artillery and Ammunition,
were very ill provided with such Things as were
necessary to sustain a Siege; nevertheless, trusting
in their Courage, they defended themselves so va∣liantly,
that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> seeing themselves re∣pulsed
with great Slaughter in several Attacks, were
obliged to enclose the City, by making strong
Line of Circumvallation round about it, in hopes
to reduce it by Famine, which succeeded accord∣ing
to their Expectation.</P>
<P>For those within, by their sudden Retreat, have∣ing
had neither Time or Opportunity to put Pro∣visions
in the City, were in a little time, reduced
to the greatest Extremity for want of them. <HI>Scha∣copski,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="167"/>
in the mean while, was not a little amaz'd,
that he received not the least News out of <HI>Poland,</HI>
whither he had dispatch'd his Messengers to adver∣tise
them of the danger they were in; and the In∣habitants
of <HI>Thula,</HI> who saw themselves reduced to
that Extremity, as to be forced to feed upon Cats,
Dogs, Horses, and such like Things, without hopes
of Relief, began to be mutinous, and to accuse
both <HI>Schacopski</HI> and <HI>Polutnich,</HI> of having betrayed
them by their fictitious Insinuations, as if their
Great Duke, <HI>Demetrius,</HI> were alive in <HI>Poland,</HI> which
if he had been, he would not have fail'd to give
them his Assistance in this Extremity. <HI>Schacopski</HI>
put the best Countenance he could upon the Matter,
telling them, that they could not expect him to
come in Person, unless back'd with a Force suita∣ble
to the Strength of his Enemies; and, that, if
they would but have Patience, he did not question,
but in a few days to hear of his approach, in
order to come to their Relief. <HI>Polutnich</HI> assur'd
them upon his Honour, that he himself had seen
and spoke with a certain Person, of about thirty
Years of Age, who was in <HI>Poland,</HI> acknowledg'd
to be the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and from whose Hands he
had received his Commission; that they should
not rely upon his Word alone, but that he would
advise them to send a trusty Messenger of their
own (one, whom they knew to have seen the
Prince <HI>Demetrius</HI> before) into <HI>Poland,</HI> to represent
to him the true State of their Affairs, and to soli∣cite
prompt Succors; that at his Return, he would
be ready to join with them in any thing they should
think most advisable for their common Safety.</P>
<P>The Citizens of <HI>Thula,</HI> having given their Con∣sent
to this Proposal, and dispatch'd a certain
Messenger, who by favour of the Night, and the
Carelesness of the Besiegers got safely thro' their
Camp without being discovered, they gave fresh
Assurance of their Stedfastness to <HI>Polutnich,</HI> till the
return of this Emissary. <HI>Schacopski,</HI> in the mean
while, was not a little surprised, that he could not
<PB N="58" REF="168"/>
hear the least Tidings out of <HI>Poland;</HI> but the true
Cause was, that the Gentleman, whom the <HI>Poles</HI>
had engag'd to personate the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> have∣ing
understood, in what ill a posture his Affairs
were in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> after the two last Defeats, began
to retract his Promise of making himself an Instru∣ment
to satisfie the Revenge of the <HI>Poles</HI> upon the
<HI>Muscovites;</HI> and setting before his Eyes the fatal
End of the late <HI>Demetrius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quia me vestigia terrent.</NOTE> after he was in Posses∣sion
of the Empire, he look'd upon the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Throne, like the Fox upon the Lion's Den, and
therefore wisely resolved rather to enjoy himself
upon his plentiful Estate in <HI>Poland,</HI> than to expose
himself to danger for the imaginary Lustre of a
Crown.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Poles,</HI> being fully resolved not to acquit
<HI>Zuski</HI> thus of the Barbarities committed against
their Countrymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another <HI>Demetri∣us</HI> set up by the <HI>Poles,</HI></NOTE> were not long before they found
out another to supply his Place; <HI>Muscovy,</HI> so fertile of
Impostors, soon furnishing them with One, whom
they look'd upon as a fit Tool to promote their ob∣stinate
Revenge against <HI>Zuski;</HI> this was one <HI>Ivan,</HI>
or <HI>John,</HI> a Native of <HI>Pocala,</HI> a City of <HI>Russia,</HI>
where he had been a School-Master for some time;
and being grown weary of his Employment, took
hold of this Opportunity to meliorate his Condi∣tion,
and if possible, to change his School Scepter
for that of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>The first who publickly espoused his Interest, was
one <HI>Micharetski,</HI> a Man of very eminent Quality
in <HI>Poland,</HI> who having gathered a considerable
Body of Troops, they marched at the Head of
them to <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> where, having been received
with the greatest demonstrations of Joy and Re∣spect
due to their Sovereign, they directed their
March to the City of <HI>Staradub,</HI> where, being rein∣forced
by some <HI>Muscovites,</HI> that upon the Rumor
spread abroad of the arrival of their Prince <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
flock'd in to them from all Parts; it was
resolved to march with all possible speed to the Re∣lief
of <HI>Thula.</HI></P>

<PB N="59" REF="169"/>
Whilst they were concerting Measures to put
their intended Design in execution, the Messenger
from the Citizens of <HI>Thula,</HI> who, for fear of be∣ing
intercepted by the Enemies Parties, that were
abroad in great Numbers, had been obliged to tra∣vel
a great way about, before he arrived at <HI>Stara∣dub,</HI>
was introduced into the presence of this new
modell'd <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who, tho' having some resem∣blance
to the other <HI>Demetrius,</HI> yet was so far dif∣ferent
from him, whom this Messenger had seen
frequently before, that he was not a little startled
at the sight of it, being scarce able to deliver his
Message without confusion. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> by the dis∣satisfaction
he observed in his Countenance, so on
guessing at the true Cause of it, judged it not ad∣visable
to send back his Resolution of marching to
the Relief of the Town by this Messenger, who,
he fear'd, might by this Discovery, raise a great
Prejudice in the Place against his Person and Inte∣rest;
wherefore, having ordered him to be secur'd
under a good Guard upon some Pretence or other,
he resolved to detain him, till he in Person, could
march to raise the Siege of the Place.</P>
<P>This precaution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thula <HI>sur∣rendred to</HI> Zuski.</NOTE> tho' in it self founded upon
very weighty Reasons, yet proved the occasion of
the loss of <HI>Thula.</HI> For both the Garrison and In∣habitants
of that City not receiving the least In∣telligence
concerning their Messenger, whom they
had dispatch'd into <HI>Poland,</HI> they concluded that
he must have fallen into the Hands of the Ene∣mies,
and being reduc'd to the utmost Extreami∣ty
for want of Provisions, it was resolved, with
Joint-consent, rather to accept of the advantage∣ous
Conditions offer'd to them by <HI>Zuski,</HI> than to
perish by Famine; pursuant to which Resolution,
the Place surrendred it self upon very honourable
Terms; which were however, but very ill observ∣ed

of the Chief Officers of the Garrison to be hang'd,
and the Brave <HI>Polutnich,</HI> and the Cunning <HI>Schacop∣ski,</HI>
to be cast into a loathsome Prison, where they
both vvere miserably Famish'd to death.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="170"/>
The <HI>Cosacks</HI> that had hitherto stood firm to the
Interest of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> having had no Intelligence of
his Approach, consequently looking upon his Cause
as desperate, embraced the Party of <HI>Zuski,</HI> who
being overjoyed at the Conquest of <HI>Thula</HI> and the
Accession of so considerable a Force, ordered his
Army in Conjunction with these <HI>Cosacks,</HI> to form
the Siege of <HI>Caluga,</HI> the strongest Place as yet in
the Possession of the <HI>Demetrians.</HI> The Army was
scarce sat down before the Place, when a Rumour
being spread among the <HI>Cosacks</HI> that <HI>Demetrius</HI> at
the Head of an Army was arrived at <HI>Staradub,</HI>
they began to mutiny first, and having drawn some
of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> into their Party, the whole
Army, upon the News spread industriously by the
<HI>Cosacks,</HI> that <HI>Demetrius</HI> was advancing to fight
them, was possessed with so panick a Fear, that
without the least Order,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zuski</HI>'s Army dis¦persed.</NOTE> they at Midnight left
their Tents, Cannon and Baggage, every one ma∣king
the best of his Way to the City of <HI>Musco</HI>
where they brought the first News to <HI>Zuski</HI> of their
imaginary Defeat, and the Flight of his Army
without being pursued by any body.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cosacks</HI> and their Party being thus left abso∣lute
Masters of the whole Camp, at the first Break
of Day did not fail to give notice of what had
happened, to the Inhabitants of <HI>Caluga,</HI> and that
<HI>Demetrius</HI> was arrived at <HI>Staradub;</HI> but these look∣ing
upon it as a Stratagem, and a Contrivance of
the <HI>Cosacks</HI> to catch them in a Trap, at first answer∣ed
them with Fire and Ball, till upon their reitera∣ted
Assurances that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were fled, and
their offering Hostages as Pledges of what they
had related to them to be Truth, they sent out
some of the Officers of the Garrison into the
Camp, who at their Return having confirm'd what
they had been assur'd of before by the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> they
soon open'd their Gates, and having shar'd the Booty
found in the Camp with them, they entred trium∣phantly
into the City.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="170"/>
After they had bestow'd a few days in rejoicing
and refreshing themselves, the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> with part of
the Garrison<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to the Number of Ten thousand,
marched from thence to the Camp of <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
near <HI>Staradub,</HI> where having rejoiced him with the
unexpected News of the Relief of <HI>Caluga,</HI> they
were received with great Demonstrations of his
Royal Favour, and vast Promises of ample Re∣wards
after his Recovery of the Throne.</P>
<P>Thus, whilst <HI>Zuski</HI> was repenting himself of his fatal
Error of having receiv'd into his Army so considera∣ble
a Number of his Enemies Troops, <HI>Demetrius</HI> en∣creased
in Strength every day; The Reputation of
what had happen'd before <HI>Caluga,</HI> and his being join'd
by the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> made such lively Impressions upon the
Minds of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> that many of them were
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or siding with the most fortunate; and the <HI>Poles</HI>
and <HI>Lithuanians,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Muscovy,</HI> being
enticed by the Hopes of Reward and Booty, flock'd
in great Numbers to his Camp; so that seeing him∣self
in a Capacity to encounter his Enemies, he
march'd in quest of them, and having found <HI>Misi∣nowski</HI>
the <HI>Muscovian</HI> General advantageously posted
at a strong Pass, he nevertheless attack'd him so fu∣riously
that he entirely routed them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Zus∣kians</HI> rou∣ted.</NOTE> killing near
Ten thousand upon the Spot, besides a great num∣ber
of Prisoners, among whom was their General
<HI>Matthew Misinowski</HI> himself.</P>
<P>This Victory gained such a Reputation to <HI>Deme∣trius,</HI>
that the whole Province of <HI>Severia,</HI> with some
other adjacent Places, readily submitted to his Obe∣dience,
acknowledging him for their true and un∣doubted
Sovereign, and promising to furnish his
Army with all manner of Necessaries. But the
<HI>Poles</HI> being more especially encourag'd by this Suc∣cess
to pursue their Revenge to the Destruction of
<HI>Zuski,</HI> sent considerable Supplies to back the Pre∣tensions
of <HI>Demetrius.</HI> Duke <HI>Roman Rosinski</HI> sent
a good Body of chosen Horse under the Command
of his Friend <HI>Walareski, Adam Wisnowiski, Char∣linski,
Mielski,</HI> and several other Lords of the first
<PB N="62" REF="171"/>
Quality in <HI>Poland,</HI> soon after joined him with such
Troops as they had raised in their respective Coun∣tries;
besides that, a new Body of 8000 <HI>Cosacks,</HI>
upon the first News of his Victory, had declared for
him, and taken service among his Troops.</P>
<P>Not long after Duke <HI>Rosinski,</HI> being also arrived
in the Camp, was by the Consent of the <HI>Polish</HI>
Lords and other Principal Officers, declared Ge∣neral
of the whole Army.</P>
<P><HI>Basili-Zuski</HI> had in the mean while applied all his
Care in getting ready his Recruits and making
new Levies throughout the whole Empire, with an
Intention to bring so formidable an Army into the
Field, as to be able to stop the further Progress of
his Enemy. For this end having formed an Army
of above a Hundred and fifty thousand Men, and
declared his Brother <HI>Demetrius. Zuski</HI> General, he
ordered him to march directly towards the <HI>Poles,</HI>
and fight them wherever he met them. Pursuant
to these Orders, the <HI>Zuskian</HI> Army march'd to∣wards
the City of <HI>Bolchow,</HI> where having fix'd
their Tents within sight of the Enemy, some Days
were spent in Skirmishes, whilst the Generals of
both Parties watch'd their Opportunity of Deci∣ding
their Quarrel by a Battel to the best Advantage;
It was not long before they found it, being equally
eager of Engaging.</P>
<P>For, as I said before, scarce had they lain thus
encamp'd a few days, but they saw the <HI>Zuskians</HI>
early in the Morning drawing out to put themselves
in Battle Array, having detach'd a Body of their best
Horse to possess themselves of some advantageous
Posts near to the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp; which these
have soon been advertised of by their Parties that
were abroad to observe the Motion of the Enemy,
they with all speed sent also a Body of their best
Horse to engage the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and to maintain
those advanced Posts, till they could be sustained by
some of their Infantry. The <HI>Polish</HI> Horse engaged
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> with so much Bravery, that after an
Engagement of an Hour they forced them to quit
<PB N="63" REF="171"/>
those Posts, whilst the whole Army was putting in
Order of Battle, having taken the Advantage of
the same Ground which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> intended to
have made use of against them.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Muscovites <HI>being bassled in their first En∣terprize,
however did not lose Courage, as trusting
to their Number, and</HI> Demetrius Zuski <HI>their Gene∣ral,
at the Head of them, left nothing unat∣tempted
which might encourage his Soldiers to
fight bravely against the sworn Enemies of their
Country; He told them,</HI> That a great part of the
<HI>Demetrian</HI> Army was composed out of Vagabonds
and Rebels, whom they had seen fly before them so
often of late, and who now puffed up with their
late Success near <HI>Caluga,</HI> more to be attributed to
their Treachery and a Luck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Chance than their bra∣very,
had once more the Impudence to look them in
the Face, hurried on by their ill Destiny, to receive
the Reward of their Treacheries from their Hands;
That the rest were <HI>Poles,</HI> the Hereditary Enemies
of their Country and Religion, unto whom must be
ascribed all the Evils and Mischiefs which had befaln
their Empire for these several Years last past; That
this insolent Nation, not being contented to have once
before involved their Country in Blood and Confusion
by setting up an Impostor instead of the true <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
slain at <HI>Ugletz,</HI> were now upon the point
of Imposing upon them a Second, in order to dispose
of the Throne of <HI>Muscovy</HI> at their Pleasure, to en∣slave
their Country, and to root out the true an∣cient
<HI>Greek</HI> Religion. <HI>He represented to them,
how inglorious, nay, ignominious it would be to
the whole</HI> Russian <HI>Nation, who had extended their
Conquests over most of the neighbouring Countries,
to receive Laws from the</HI> Poles, <HI>who had conspired
their Ruin and Destruction. That therefore they
being to expect nothing but Misery from their mor∣tal
Enemies, they must look for their Deliverance
in their own Courage, with a Resolution not to
out-live that Day, which, if lost, would put an
End to all the Glory purchased by their Ancestors,
<PB N="64" REF="172"/>
to their own Felicity, and that of all their Po∣sterity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rosinski</HI> on the other hand, the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Gene∣ral,
was not wanting to enflame the Courage of
his Soldiers, by representing to them: That the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> which they saw before them, were the
Remnants of those whom they had so often beaten
with a much less number; witness their late En∣gagement
with <HI>Misinowski,</HI> whom, to their eternal
Glory, they had droven from his advantageous
Post, notwithstanding the inequality of their num∣ber.
That therefore they should not be startled at
their Enemies, who, tho much more nu∣merous,
were, for the most part, an undisci∣plin'd
Rabble, terrible only in outward Ap∣pearance,
the rest, who so lately had experi∣ence
of their invincible Courage, scarce daring
to look their Conquerours in the face. He
desired them to remember the Slaughter of that
Countrymen in cold Blood, against all the Laws of
Hospitality, by that very same Rabble, whom they
were now going to Engage; that their Blood cry∣ing
for Vengeance, they had now the fairest Op∣portunity
in the World, to take the most ample
Satisfaction from those barbarous Wretches, and to
punish them for their Cruelties. He concluded 
That they ought to consider, that the Conquest of
whole <HI>Muscovy,</HI> depended upon the points of their
Swords, and that one day's labour would put them
into Possession of a vast Empire, and all the Riches
and Treasure of their Enemies, be the Reward of
the Victory.</P>
<P><HI>Rosinski</HI> finding a great eagerness in his Soldiers
to Engage, led them on straight to the Enemy,
whom they attack'd with an unparallell'd Bra∣very,
and forced them several times to shrink be∣fore
the daring <HI>Poles;</HI> but being continually re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣forced
with fresh Supplies, they maintain'd the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ground in spite of the Bravery of the <HI>Demetrians,</HI>
so that the Success of the Battle remain'd doubt∣ful
for a great part of the Day. But it is to be
<PB N="65" REF="172"/>
observed, that the <HI>Cosacks</HI> (in the same manner as
<HI>Zaporius</HI> did some years before, when he fought
<HI>Hodwen</HI> the <HI>Borisian</HI> General) had placed all their
Boys, and other Attendants belonging to the Bag∣gage▪
with some Soldiers, enough to make up a
Front, at some distance behind the Line of Bat∣tle;
these upon a Signal, agreed betwixt them,
advanc'd during the heat of the Battle, with their
Colours flying, Drums beating, and Trumpets
sounding; which the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who were alrea∣dy
scarce able to sustain the Fury of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
having perceived, and believing it to be a Body of
Reserve, coming to attack them afresh, they be∣gan
to give Ground; which the <HI>Polish</HI> Horse being
sensible of, they renew'd the Charge with so much
Bravery, that in less than an Hours time, they
forced the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Cavalry to quit the Field in
great disorder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zuski</HI>'s Army en∣tirely rout∣ed.</NOTE> The Infantry being thus exposed,
both in Front and Flank, were soon put to an en∣tire
Rout, with a great Slaughter, being bereav'd
of their Horse to cover their Retreat; so, that out
of this vast Army, there were not five hundred
left that quitted the Field in a Body; except five
thousand, who saved themselves in the City of
<HI>Belchow,</HI> but were in a few days after forced to sur∣render
at discretion to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who falling into
the same Error as <HI>Zuski</HI> did before with the <HI>Co∣sacks,</HI>
took them into Pay, and received the same
Reward from their hands, as we shall see anon.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> being by so signal a Victory, become
Master of the Field, and the whole Camp, Can∣non
and Baggage of the Enemy, what wonder, if
all the adjacent Places followed the Fortune of the
Conquerour, unto whom they opened their Gates,
without the least Opposition; unless it were <HI>Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sko,</HI>
and two or three more, who had Courage
enough to make some shew of Resistance, but at the
approach of the Victorious Army, surrendred also
at Discretion.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="173"/>
Having thus opened his way to the Capital City
of <HI>Musco,</HI> he directed his March thither, not que∣stioning
but that the Terror of his last Victory,
would have so strong an influence over the dis∣heartned
Citizens, as to make them open their
Gates at his first arrival before the City. It is n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
difficult thing to imagine, that the Loss of so vast
an Army, on which seem'd to depend the Fate of
the whole Empire, must needs put that City; up∣on
the approach of the Conquerour, into such a
Consternation, as is not easie to be express'd. But
besides the presence of their Great Duke <HI>Basili▪
Zuski,</HI> who in this extremity of his Affairs, was
not wanting by all means possible to inspire Courage
into his dejected Subjects; there were two thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which contributed not a little to the Resolution of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Citizens, to adhere to <HI>Zuski</HI> to the last Extre∣mity.
The first was, That <HI>Demetrius,</HI> in lieu of
Marching directly to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> trifled a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
way his Time in the more Northern Province<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
where the <HI>Poles</HI> rambling up and down the Coun∣try,
were often intercepted by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who
in the mean while▪ had leisure given them, to re∣cover
themselves out of their first Fright, and to
take such measures as were most suitable to the pre∣sent
Condition of their Affairs. The second was
the Perfidiousness of these five thousand <HI>Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vites,</HI>
who, after their Surrender at <HI>Bolchow,</HI> had<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
taken Service under <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and, now having
watch'd their Opportunity, left him again, and
went over to <HI>Zuski,</HI> unto whom they gave an Ac∣count
of the whole Condition of the Army, as∣suring
him, that the <HI>Poles</HI> were not near so formi∣dable
nor numerous, as represented to them by
Fame; and that it would be no difficult matter fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the City to defend it self against them, till be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
reinforced with fresh Supplies out of the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
mote Provinces of the Kingdom, they might meet
with a more favourable Opportunity to remove
them from their Walls.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="173"/>
This relation, and the delays of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> have∣ing
put new Courage into the frighted Citi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns,
it was resolved, with what Forces they could assem∣ble
in haste, to post themselves in a very advan∣tageous
Place, on the borders of the Province of
<HI>Severia,</HI> thereby to cut off all Communication be∣twixt
the <HI>Poles</HI> and the Southern Provinces of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
bordering▪ on <HI>Lithuania,</HI> from whence they
must be supplied with Men, and all other Neces∣saries
for the carrying on of the War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles</HI> were not a little sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tled at this vigo∣rous
Refolution of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> whom they be∣lieved
to have been lost past all recovery; but
having no other way left them to secure their Re∣treat,
and to keep open the communication with
their own Country, than their Swords, they re∣solved
to make an Amends for their ill Conduct, by
their Bravery. Having therefore drawn back their
Army from the more Northern Parts, to the South
side of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> they march'd to the
Frontiers of <HI>Severia,</HI> where having with a most
gallant Resolution either to vanquish or to die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mus∣covites</HI> de∣feated.</NOTE> at∣tack'd
those Forces in their advantageous Post,
they put them to the rout, and thus having opened
their Passage, they pitch'd their Tents near the
City of <HI>Tusin,</HI> betwixt the two Rivers, <HI>Tusin</HI> and
<HI>Moska,</HI> which in a manner surrounded and secur'd
their Camp.</P>
<P>Being now become more and more sensible of
their Error,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Musco</HI> block'd up by <HI>Deme∣trius.</HI></NOTE> in having neglected to make themselves
Masters before of so advantageous a Post, which
in all likelihood would have prov'd fatal to that
City during the first Consternation, they by fre∣quent
Excursions endeavoured to repair their first
Fault; by which they so enclosed the Citizens with∣in
their Walls, that scarce a Man durst appear at
any distance from the Town. The Inhabitants
seeing themselves thus reduced to great Scarcity,
as being very near quite shut up by the frequent
Excursions of the <HI>Poles,</HI> and seeing themselves in
no Capacity at present to drive them from their ad∣vantageous
<PB N="68" REF="174"/>
Post, it was resolved to try▪ whether
by certain Proposals of Peace, they might not
disunite the <HI>Poles</HI> in the Camp of <HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P>They had ever since the last Massacre of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
detained the <HI>Polish</HI> Ambassadors, and the Weywod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> with his Daughter, the Great
Dutchess <HI>Marina,</HI> Prisoners; and as they did not
question that they were very desirous of their Li∣berty,
so, they believ'd they might make use of
them as fit Instruments to encompass their Design.
It was not the Reconciliation with the <HI>Poles</HI> they
aim'd at, but knowing the Nature of the <HI>Poles</HI> to
be unstable, they hoped by this Artifice, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
time, at least till the arrival of those Supplie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
which were raising for their Relief in the Northern
Provinces, by <HI>Knez Basili Masalski,</HI> a near K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣man
to the Great Duke <HI>Basili Zuski.</HI></P>
<P>To obtain this end, a Treaty of Peace was pro∣posed
to the <HI>Polish</HI> Ambassadors and the Wey wode
of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> and that in the mean while, to re∣move
all Obstacles, a Cessation of Arms should be
agrreed on for a certain Time. The Wey wode of
<HI>Sendomiria</HI> being very willing to lay hold of this
Opportunity, to free himself from his Captivity,
sent one of his best Friends into the Camp of <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
to make these Proposals, and in case of
Refusal, to endeavour to perswade the <HI>Poles</HI> to se∣parate
themselves from <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and to cease
from committing any Hostilities, which in all like∣lihood
might prove an obstac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the Conclusion
of the Peace, and consequently to his Liberty.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Poles</HI> in the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp, not mea∣suring
their Interest by that of the Weywode, but by
the Success of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> from whence they hoped
to reap the fruits of their past Labours, were so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
from hearkning to these Propositions, that they
would not as much as enter upon the least Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣merce
of a Treaty, unless it were granted as a Pre∣liminary
Article; <HI>That</HI> Demetrius <HI>should be imme∣diately
restored to the Throne, and the Ʋsurper</HI> Zuski,
<HI>to be delivered up into their hands.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="174"/>
The <HI>Muscovites</HI> finding themselves disappointed
in their Expectation, had no other Means left to
secure themselves, but to repel Force with Force;
For which end, having dispatch'd frequent Messen∣gers
to <HI>Basili Masalski,</HI> whom we mention'd before,
to hasten to their Relief; he, pursuant to the re∣iterated
Orders from Court, march'd with his Ar∣my
which consisted of near fourscore thousand Men,
towards the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> where, having entren∣ched
himself upon the Banks of the River <HI>Chodiun∣ka</HI>
about a League from the City, he hop'd to meet
with a favourable Opportunity to dislodge the <HI>De∣metrians,</HI>
or at least to annoy them, and hinder
their frequent Excursions.</P>
<P>But <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inski,</HI> who was not insensible of the In∣conveniencies
which must needs be occasion'd by
the nearness of so great an Army to his Camp,
resolved to beat up their Quarters with the first Op∣portunity.
For which purpose he drew his Army
out of the Lines, unperceiv'd of the Enemy by
favour of the Night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Zu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> Army ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted.</NOTE> and having approach'd the
Enemies Camp, over-secure in their Number and
nearness to the City, attack'd them in their En∣trenchments
with such Fury, that in a few hours
they kill'd near Twenty thousand upon the Place,
the rest escaping to the City, leaving among the
Prisoners their General in the Hands of the E∣nemy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles,</HI> who had purchased so signal a Victory
with the loss of very few of their Men, had almost
dearly paid for it at last. For, having dispersed them∣selves
all over the Fields without the least Order
or any Guard to secure them, and being thus enga∣ged
in the Pillage of the dead Bodies and the E∣nemies
Camp; the <HI>Muscovites</HI> at break of day, ha∣ving

with fresh Supplies out of the City, return'd to the
Charges, and renewing the Combat, fell every

the Enemy, so that there was nothing but Disor∣der,
Confusion and Slaughter to be seen all over the
Field, and the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were upon the point of
snatching the Victory out of the Hands of their
Conquerours, who began to prepare to save them∣selves
by Flight, had it not been for their Generals
who coming in timely with a small Body of Horse
to their Assistance, both by their Words and Exam∣ple
encouraged them either to vanquish or to die.
They appear'd in every place where they found
their Presence most necessary, to animate the Sol∣diers
opprest by the Number of their Enemies,
they told them that being surrounded on all sides,
they must put all their Hopes of Relief on the
Points of their Swords; they represented to them,
how ignominious it would be, to be routed by
those they had so lately vanquish'd, and to suffer
themselves to be robb'd of the Fruits of their Vi∣ctory;
so, that partly out of Shame, partly out of
Despair, they first began to make good their
Ground, and then, being animated with Revenge,
they fell with such fury upon the <HI>Muscovites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Zus∣kians</HI> bea∣ten a se∣cond time.</NOTE> that
at last they forced them to retreat, and thus in

<P>The Ambassadors and the Weywode gladly ac∣cepted
their offers, but being very desirous of their
Liberty, told them that, they did not question
if Matters were truly represented to the King, he
might in time be induced to draw off his Supplies
from <HI>Demetrius;</HI> But that, as his Interest at Court
was back'd by some of the Chiefest Men of the King∣dom,
and in great Esteem with the King himself,
so it was not to be supposed, that they should be
able to prevail against their Power, when absent,
which perhaps, when present, they might do with∣out
much Difficulty, by representing to the Court
the true State of the Case, and the Imposture of
<HI>Demetrius.</HI> They represented to them, how advan∣tageous
it would be to their Affairs, in detecting
the whole Intrigue of this supposititious <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
if <HI>Marina</HI> in Person appear'd at Court, and by her
own Confession confirmed the Death of her Lord,
which would put the Imposture of this Pretender
beyond all question, and, without doubt, contri∣bute
more than all other Endeavours towards the
recalling of the <HI>Poles</HI> out of the Service of the Im∣postor.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> did not very well relish these
Propositions, being unwilling to part with their
Prisoners upon so easie Terms; But being at last
over-ruled by the Speciousness of their alledged
Reasons, and much more by the absolute Necessity
of their Affairs, they were at last forced to comply
with the Desires of these <HI>Polish</HI> Lords, unto whom,
as well as to <HI>Marina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marina</HI> and her Father set at liberty.</NOTE> they granted their Liberty,
under Condition, that they should undertake to
oblige the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to draw back the Army
of his Subjects, which lay encamped under the
Walls of the City of <HI>Musco.</HI> They were not spa∣ring
in their Promises, so that every thing being a∣greed
on betwixt them, they were in a few days
after, permitted to depart under a Guard of five
<PB N="72" REF="176"/>
hundred Horse, to defend them against the Parties
of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> that were continually abroad in great
Numbers.</P>
<P>This Treaty had not been managed with so much
Secrecy, but that <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who was not without
his Spies within the City, had got Scent of it, by
whose Means also having got Notice of the Day of
their Departure, and judging, not without great
Reason, how disadvantageous their Presence at the
<HI>Polish</HI> Court might prove to his Affairs; and on the
other hand considering, that nothing could contri∣bute
more at this time towards the Strengthening of
his Party, than if, by joining their Interest with
his, he could bring them over to his Side, and en∣gage
<HI>Marina</HI> to own him for her Husband; he
sent out <HI>Zlarowski</HI> with fifteen hundred Horse to
intercept their Passage. <HI>Zlarowski,</HI> having been
before hand informed which way they were to pass,
had not marched above two Hours before he met
with them, and having ordered five or six hundred
of his Horse to face the <HI>Muscovites</HI> who guarded
the <HI>Polish</HI> Lords, he in Person, with a few of his Offi∣cers,
were advancing to address themselves to <HI>Marina</HI>
and the Weywode her Father; But the <HI>Zuskian</HI> Horse,
at the first sight of the <HI>Poles,</HI> whom they saw much
stronger than themselves, look'd for their Safety in
the Swiftness of their Horses, making the best of their
Way towards <HI>Musco,</HI> and leaving the <HI>Poles</HI> commit∣ted
to their Charge, at the Disposal of their Country-men,
<HI>Zlarowski</HI> making his Addresses to <HI>Ma∣rina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are inter∣cepted and conducted to <HI>Deme∣trius.</HI></NOTE>
complemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed her in the Name of <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
telling her, that he was sent to invite them to his
Camp, being ambitious not to let slip so favourable
an Opportunity of delivering them out of the
Hands of their Enemies. <HI>Marina</HI> and the Wey∣wode
were at some uncertainty what to answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
but seeing themselves in no Capacity of making
any Resistance, they return'd <HI>Zlarowski</HI> Thanks for
his Care and Vigilancy, and with a seeming Glad∣ness
went forward to the <HI>Polish</HI> Camp, where they
were presented, immediately after their Arrival, to
<PB N="73" REF="176"/>
<HI>Demetrius</HI> Those of a more refined judgment
look'd upon this proceeding of <HI>Demetrius</HI> as a gross
Mistake in Point of Policy, to admit <HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>
and the <HI>Polish</HI> Lords, who were quite unprepared
for an Interview of this nature, into his Presence▪
For <HI>Marina,</HI> as well as her Father and the Ambas∣sadors,
being surprised at first sight, to see this <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
differ very much from the Great Duke,
slain in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> betray'd their dissatis∣faction
sufficiently, both in their Countenances,
and the strangeness of their behaviour towards
him; which having been observed as well by <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
himself, as some others that were present at
the Interview, he thought it most advisable to send
them to another Quarter of the Camp, with Or∣ders
not to take notice, that they had been seen by
him; hoping thus to hush up the former
Passage, till they could concert new Measures to
carry on the Intrigue to their mutual Advantage.</P>
<P>But an Error of this Nature being not so soon
corrected, the manner of this interview could not
be hid from some of the more quick-sighted; and
among others had not escaped the particular Obser∣vance
of <HI>Kniasus Masalski,</HI> a Kinsman both to the
routed General of that Name, and to <HI>Zuski</HI> him∣self,
who was ever since the last Defeat detain'd a
Prisoner in the Camp.</P>
<P>He having watch'd his opportunity a few days
after, made his Escape, and got into the City;
where he related to <HI>Zuski</HI> and the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
the Doubts which had at the first interview
with <HI>Demetrius,</HI> appear'd in <HI>Marina</HI>'s Countenance
and Carriage; all which he represented, with so
much Dexterity, and in terms so lively and natural,
that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> being fully perswaded of
the Imposture, unanimously resolved to adhere
to <HI>Zuski</HI> to the last Extremity, and rather to en∣dure
any thing, than to submit themselves under
the Government of an Impostor, imposed upon
them by the Contrivances of their mortal Enemies
the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="177"/>
<HI>Zuskis</HI> seeing the People thus confirm'd in his In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest;
by the prejudice they had conceived against
the Person of his Rival, bethought himself of a
certain States-Trick, by which he hoped to render
the Fallacy of his Adversary so evident to the <HI>Mus∣covites,</HI>
as that there should be no room left for any
further Doubt, to be made upon that score. He
deputed some Persons of the first Quality and great
esteem among the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to <HI>Ʋgletz,</HI> to disin∣terr
the Body of the Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> which had
lain there fifteen years, in order to have it convey∣ed
to <HI>Musco,</HI> to be deposited in the Sepulchre of
the Grand Dukes of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Scarce was the Body
taken out of the Ground, but it was very industri∣ously
spread abroad and insinuated into the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
(who without the least difficulty receive an
Impression which savours of Superstition) that it
had wrought most surprising Miracles, as had been
found by the experience of some diseased Persons,
who had touch'd it by chance. They had been very
careful in having at hand some suborned Lame and
Blind, who upon the first touch of it went away up∣right
and clear-sighted; besides a great many other
pretended Distempers, otherwise incurable, which
were removed in an instant by the miraculous Ver∣tue
of this Body. They had also taken particular care
to bring a Body, which having not been long under
Ground, was as yet uncorrupted; so, that the Venera∣tion
of the Superstitious People being heightned,
when they found it entire after fifteen Years Burial, it
was look'd upon as a Crime deserving no less than
Death, to question the Truth of this Fable; for
which reason also the People made their Addresses
to <HI>Zuski,</HI> desiring that it might remain disinterr'd,
till a Temple could be built, where it should be
reverenced as a Saint; which at their Importunity
was granted them by the Great Duke for that time.</P>
<P>But not long after wisely considering with him∣self,
that such gross Absurdities could not be long
hidden from the Eyes of the most quick-sighted,
and fearing, lest the Cheat should be discovered,
<PB N="75" REF="177"/>
to his Confusion, and the no small detriment of
his Affairs, he caused the Body of this Saint to be
suddenly, but very solemnly interr'd among the
Tombs of the Great Dukes; to appease the Mur∣murs
of the common People, it was publish'd by
<HI>Zuski</HI>'s Order; that tho' he did not discommend
their Zeal for their Prince, whose Memory ought
ever to be sacred among them; nevertheless that,
having observed his Subjects to pay the same Ve∣neration
to a mortal Creature, which was only due
to the immortal Creator, he had taken this Reso∣lution
to deposite his Body amongst his Ancestors,
rather than to be instrumental in drawing upon
himself and his Subjects the Vengeance of God
Almighty at this time of imminent Danger, when
they stood most in need of his Mercy.</P>
<P>But it is time to return to the Camp, where we
have left <HI>Marina</HI> and her Father to recover them∣selves
of their first Surprize, occasioned by the In∣terview,
we have mentioned before. These having
in the mean while had sufficient leisure to consult
with some of their intimate Friends, what was best
to be done in the present Emergency of their Af∣fairs,
whether to accept the Offers of this new
modell'd <HI>Demetrius</HI> (who had not been wanting
by his Emissaries to insinuate unto them his Pre∣tensions,
as far as the Nature of so nice a Thing
would admit of) or to reject them with Scorn, and
by the Interest of their Friends in the Camp, to en∣deavour
their Return to the Court of <HI>Sigismund,</HI>
King of <HI>Poland.</HI> They were not a little divided in
their Opinions. Some of them represented to <HI>Ma∣rina,</HI>
how ignominious it would be for a Person
of her Extraction and Dignity, to throw herself
away upon an unknown Vagabond, whom she
herself knew to be an Impostor, and set up by the
<HI>Poles,</HI> for no other End, than to serve their own
Turn of revenging themselves upon <HI>Zuski</HI> and the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> which when they had effected, and
found themselves strong enough to maintain their
Interest in <HI>Muscovy</HI> without him, they would be
<PB N="76" REF="178"/>
sure to cast off, and throw him upon the Dunghill,
with no less difficulty than they had taken him up.
That the <HI>Zuskians</HI> would not fail to improve the
whole to her disadvantage, and to alledge against
her, that she had married a mean Wretch, and a
suborued Property, in hopes to satisfie her own
Ambition, and to gratify the Ends of a third Party.
On the other hand, it was urged, that there being
no great likelihood that the <HI>Poles</HI> should abandon
his Interest, more than they had done that of the
former, as being founded upon the same bottom,
and link'd together by a mutual Interest, the most
indissoluble Knot of all humane Affairs, no suffici∣ent
Reason could be alledg'd, why she should not
as well own this <HI>Demetrius</HI> as the former, being
both, equally doubtful, as to their Descent, in re∣lation
to the Great Duke, <HI>John Basilovits;</HI> and,
that, since she had once had the Misfortune of
throwing herself into the Arms of an Impostor,
she might, with the same Reason, not refuse the
Embraces of a Second, when no less than the
Crown of so vast an Empire lay at stake. That,
supposing his Birth to be inferior to that of the o∣ther
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> he was just upon the point of ac∣complishing
his Design; and that the <HI>Muscovites▪</HI>
reduced to the utmost Extremities, as soon
as they were informed of her having owned him
for her Husband, would not be long before they
would receive him for their Emperour, and place
him in the Throne of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> That the Crown
would soon wipe off all the Stain of his ignoble
Birth, were it never so base and sordid, and exalt
him to the same degree with the most illustrious
Monarchs of the World. Besides that, if she re∣fused
him, she must run a great risque of her Re∣putation,
it being beyond all question, that <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
and his Friends, to put the better Colour
upon their Pretensions, would not fail to publish
to the World; That ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed she had formerly been
his Wife, but that since, he had Repudiated her,
by reason of her Incontinency.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="178"/>
<HI>Marina</HI> having well weigh'd all the Reasons al∣ledged
on both sides, as Ambition was the most
predominant. Passion in her Soul, and that she had
once tasted of the Sweets of a Crown, she inclin'd
to the Advice of those, who were of Opinion,
that, since she had once sat upon the Throne of
<HI>Russia,</HI> she ought not to let slip any Means, tho'
never so difficult, to recover it. This Considera∣tion
being the most prevailing with the Lady, who
flatter'd herself, with the hopes of better Success in
this, than the former Marriage, she resolved to set
aside all Scruples, to accommode herself to the
present ticklish. Juncture of time, and not to let
slip this Opportunity to re-ascend the Throne of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> which she had lost before, almost as soon
as she was in Possession of it. This Resolution
having soon been communicated to <HI>Demetrius;</HI> as
the whole Business was a Design of a popular Na∣ture,
so it was thought most advisable to be trans∣acted
in view of the whole Army; the better to
blind the World, and to put some Colour upon the
delay of this publick Interview, it was given out,
That the Great Dutchess <HI>Marina,</HI> had been indis∣posed
for these ten days last past, ever since her
arrival in the Camp, and that being now recovered,
<HI>Demetrius</HI> was going to conduct her to his Tent.</P>
<P>The whole Army therefore being drawn out in∣to
the Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marina re∣ceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by <HI>Deme∣trius.</HI></NOTE> with all the great Officers in their
respective Stations, <HI>Demetrius</HI> accompanied by all
the Nobility of both Nations there present, by all
the Foreign Ambassadors and Deputies or the re∣volted
Provinces, went on Horseback to meet her
in the open Field, where being met, they both, at
some Yards distance did alight, he from his Horse,
she out of her Coach; Having received one another
with open Arms, they intermingled their Kisses
with Tears, and with Expressions so tender, so
passionate, and so natural, that it was impossible
even for the most quick-sighted so much as to sus∣pect
an Interview so solemn and passionate, to be
artificial; especially when they saw the Lady <HI>Ma∣rina,</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="179"/>
after the first Caresses were past, pay to <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
the highest Reverence and Marks of a most
profound Esteem, as she had before given him the
most passionate Testimonies of an unfeigned Love,
and the most sincere Affection; whilst <HI>Demetrius</HI>
could do nothing else than repay these Endear∣ments
with his repeated Embraces.</P>
<P>After some time spent in those mutual Caresses,
<HI>Demetrius</HI> made his particular Application to the
Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> the Father of <HI>Marina,</HI>
unto whom he told, That next to the Recovery
of his Dear Spouse out of the Hands of those bar∣barous
Wretches, nothing could be more pleasing
to him at this time, than to see himself in a Con∣dition
to make him in Person the Acknowledg∣ments
due to him for all the Honours he had re∣ceived
at his Hands. He put him in mind, that, as
he had been the first who had given real Encourage∣ment
to his undertaking, by publickly espousing
his Interest in <HI>Poland,</HI> so he had ever since been the
constant Companion of all his Labours and the
various Vicissitudes of Fortune, till that unhappy
Separation on the sixteenth day of <HI>May,</HI> occasion'd
by the Contrivances of their most barbarous Ene∣mies.
He concluded, that the same propitious
Fate, which had so miraculously preserv'd him
from falling into their Hands, and now bad once
more blest him with the sight of those Persons he
lov'd and reverenc'd most in the World, in spite of
all the malicious Endeavours of their implacable
Enemies, seem'd already by its auspicious Influence
to have directed his Path, by which to re-ascend
his Throne, to enable him to pay his real Acknow∣ledgments
to his Friends, and to put his Enemies to
Shame and Confusion.</P>
<P>The Weywode, after having returned his most
humble Thanks to <HI>Demetrius</HI> for putting so high a
Value upon his Services, for which he own'd him∣self
sufficiently rewarded by having honour'd his
Family with his Alliance, in marrying his Daugh∣ter,
and the publick Acknowledgement given just
<PB N="79" REF="179"/>
now in the Presence of so many great and brave
Men, failed not to insert some remarkable Passages
common to them both since their first Attempt of
entring <HI>Muscovy</HI> with an Army; and concluded,
that he had all the Reason to believe, that the same
Power which had been so instrumental in preserving
them from so many Dangers, and surmounting all
these Difficulties, would crown all their past La∣bours
in a little time with a happy End.</P>
<P>To be short, the Lady play'd so naturally the In∣nocent,
her Father so ingeniously the Politician, and
<HI>Demetrius</HI> himself personated so artificially the real
Grand Duke, that all three acting their Parts to the
Life, drew Tears from the Eyes of the Spectators,
the most subtle and quick-sighted being constrain∣ed,
even against their Inclination, to rest satisfied
in such apparent Testimonies of a well-grounded
Love and Friendship, as all the rest▪ however wa∣vering
before, were now confirm'd of the Reality
of <HI>Demetrius</HI> to be past all Dispute. The whole
Ceremony being ended in the Field with all the
Dexterity imaginable, they marched in great
Pomp, under the Acclamations of the whole Ar∣my
to <HI>Demetrius</HI> his Tent.</P>
<P>The Rumour of this extraordinary Interview
having been soon spread all over the neighbouring
Provinces, and from thence throughout the whole
Empire; the <HI>Muscovites</HI> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e flocking to the
Camp from all Parts; and the most remote Pro∣vinces
sent their Deputies to make their Submission
to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> scarce any standing out, except <HI>Smo∣lensko,</HI>
with its Capital City of the same Name,
and a few others▪ so that the Camp was abundantly
supplied with all manner of Provisions out of the
circumjacent Parts. Things being in this Posture,
it was resolved to render the whole Camp more
convenient, and accommodate it against the ap∣proaching
Winter; For which purpose there was
not only a very magnificent Structure (after the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Fashion) erected for the Great Duke
and Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dutchess; but there was scarce a Person
<PB N="80" REF="180"/>
of Qualty, or Officer of Note, who had not a
House prepared for his Dwelling-place, with all
the Conveniencies that could be had, in a well re∣gulated
City, the whole Camp being divided into
several goodly Streets, with a Market, and other
publick Places; the common Soldiers being lodged
in Huts, well provided against the approaching
Winter-Season. The whole was encompassed with
a very strong Line, fortified at certain distances
with Redoubts, and good store of Cannon, so that
it had the resemblance of a very large and strong∣ly
fortified City.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Musco,</HI> tho' not a little dis∣heartned
by the general Defection of the Country,
and the Neighbourhood of the Enemy, who by the
countenance of their Camp seem'd to be resolved
not to quit the Enterprize at an easie rate, yet
did not lose Courage, and finding themselves de∣priv'd
of all Means to draw Supplies out of their
own Country, they had recourse to the same Po∣licy,
which <HI>Boris Goudenou</HI> intended to have made
use of against the <HI>Poles,</HI> if he had not been pre∣vented
by his sudden Death. They were suffici∣ently
sensible, that <HI>Charles,</HI> then King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
who had found Means to exclude his Nephew <HI>Sigis∣mund,</HI>
then King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and lawful Heir to the
Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> from that Crown, would be glad
of any Opportunity to stop the Progress of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
to prevent their becoming Masters of the Empire of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> which would infallibly open them the
way into the <HI>Swedish</HI> Territories. They apply'd
themselves therefore to the beforementioned King
<HI>Charles,</HI> who, upon their Request, sent them con∣siderable
Supplies, and first check'd the course of the
Victories of the <HI>Poles,</HI> which gave such Encourage∣ment
to many other Provinces of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> that being
tir'd with the Insolencies and Exactions of the <HI>Deme∣trians,</HI>
they shook off the <HI>Polish</HI> Yoke, and these be∣ing
thus entangled in new Difficulties, when they
thought themselves upon the point of accomplish∣ing
their Design, fell into Dissentions, by the mis∣management
<PB N="81" REF="180"/>
of <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> which
at last proved fatal, both to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and the
<HI>Polish</HI> Affairs in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> which was thus unex∣pectedly
delivered from its Enemies; when in all
Humane Appearance, they were ready to triumph
over them; as it will sufficiently appear out of the
Sequel of this History.</P>
<P>For, when the <HI>Poles</HI> saw the <HI>Muscovites</HI> reduced
to the greatest straights that could be, by these in∣testine
Dissensions, raised and fomented by their
Contrivance, they judged now to have met with a
favourable Opportunity to make themselves Ma∣sters
of that vast Empire. For which reason, the
Senate of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> represented to
their King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> how easie it would be for
him, at this critical Juncture, to gives Laws to
both Parties in that divided Empire, if he would
shew himself at the Head of a considerable Army,
which was ready at hand in <HI>Poland,</HI> to march upon
his first Orders, into <HI>Russia,</HI> where they might live
upon the Country, whereas they must now be
maintain'd at the Charge of the Republick. Be∣sides
the benefit he would reap from this Expediti∣on,
in giving Laws to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and purging
the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> of a great number of Va∣gabonds
and idle Persons, the remnants of their
late civil Dissensions, it would be a glorious Work,
to revenge the barbarous Murder of so many of
his Subjects, and the detaining of his Ambassadors.
The Chief thing objected was; that the Truce made
some Years ago betwixt both Nations was not
expir'd; But this Objection was soon answered,
considering that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> had been the first,
who violated it in Massacring the <HI>Poles</HI> against all
Laws of Hospitality, and detaining their Ambassa∣dors,
against the Law of Nations; but, supposing
this to be insufficient, the specious Pretence <HI>Sigis∣mund</HI>
might make use of in appearing for <HI>Demetri∣us,</HI>
their lawful Great Duke in Possession of the
greatest Part of the Empire, against the Usurper
of his Crown and Right, would take off the Blame
<PB N="82" REF="181"/>
of the Violation of the Truce in the eyes of the
World.</P>
<P>King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> being swayed by these impor∣tant
Considerations, alledged by his Council, at
last determined to invade <HI>Muscovy</HI> with an Army,
to be commanded by himself. In order to this De∣sign,
every thing being got ready with all possible
speed, he put himself at the Head of an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my,
consisting of thirty-thousand Men, and in the Year
1609,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>King</HI> Si∣gismund <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Muscovy.</NOTE> in <HI>August,</HI> passing the River <HI>Borysthenes,</HI> en∣tred
the Territories of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> It is without all
dispute, that▪ if, pursuant to the Advice of the Se∣nate
and his Council, he had marched directly to
the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and in conjunction with the
<HI>Demetrian</HI> Army, attack'd that City, or at least
block'd it up more closely than before; the Inha∣bitants
who were already reduced to great Straits
for want of all manner of Necessaries, would soon
have been forced to abandon <HI>Zuski,</HI> and to embrace
his Party; which done▪ it would have been no diffi∣cult
Matter to suppress <HI>Demetrius,</HI> by drawing from
his side the <HI>Cosacks</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI> (the main, if not the on∣ly
Strength of his Army) by great Rewards; and
thus, either to render himself absolute Master of
the whole Empire, or at least, by coming to a com∣position
with <HI>Demetrius,</HI> to unite all the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Provinces, bordering on <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> with
his Crown. But instead of following these whole∣some
Counsels, he took quite contrary measures,
which rendred his whole Design abortive, and lost
his Son <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> the Crown of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as he
himself, by his own mismanagement had lost that
of <HI>Sweden.</HI> It had been insinuated to him, that
if he would march to <HI>Smolensko,</HI> the Capital of the
Province of the same name, it would be surren∣dred
into his hands at his first appearing before it.
This City, which is seated on the Banks of the <HI>Bo∣rysthenes,</HI>
and surrounded with a very good Wall of
Stone and Brick, was in those days much larger
than it is now, it having been much altered from
its former Beauty and Wealth by the various Chan∣ces
<PB N="83" REF="181"/>
of War; and tho' it had no out-works or Ditch,
yet this Defect was supply'd by a very numerous
Garrison, consisting of thirty thousand Men, be∣sides
the Inhabitants, whose number amounted to
as many, if not more, that were able to bear
Arms; The Weywode or Governour of the Place,
was one <HI>Michael Sehin,</HI> an intimate Friend of <HI>Zus∣ki,</HI>
who being sufficiently provided with Ammuni∣tion,
Artillery, Provisions, and all other Necessaries
for a long Siege, was resolved to defend it to the
last drop of Blood, knowing it to be the only place
of Importance in the whole Empire, which re∣main'd
stedfast in the Interest of <HI>Zuski▪ Sigismund</HI>
being misguided by some of his flattering Courtiers,
as soon as he had passed the <HI>Borysthenes,</HI> resolved
upon an hasty March, and being cajol'd into a Belief,
that he was rather going to receive than force <HI>Smo∣lensko,</HI>
leaving all his Cannon behind him, marched
with all possible speed towards that City. He was
no sooner come in sight of it, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he found him∣self
miserably mistaken, both in his Intelligence
and Purpose; the Garrison making a furious▪ Sally
upon him, and being afterwards summon'd to sur∣render
by <HI>Sapiha,</HI> the Chancellor of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the
Weywod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sehin</HI> rejected his Offers with Scorn.
There were not a few at that time in the Army,
who advised the King not to hazard his Army in
the Siege of a Place, which being provided with a
numerous Garrison, and resolute in its Defence,
would prove a work of great difficulty to gain;
but to take hold of this favourable Juncture, which
invited him to <HI>Musco,</HI> the Capital City of the Em∣pire,
before they were re-inforced with the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI>
Auxiliaries; but the Opinion of the <HI>Lithuanian</HI>
Chancellour and his Friends, was most prevailing,
who remonstrated, that a few Months would re∣duce
so great a Multitude, however well provided
at present, to distress, when restrain'd from Forage∣ing
and bringing in Provisions, or at the worst,
that a vigorous Attack would in a little time, bring
them to better terms; by which the King having
<PB N="84" REF="182"/>
secured himself a safe Retreat, might with the less
danger march to the Capital City of <HI>Musco.</HI> Pur∣suant
to this Resolution, the King ordered all the
Avenues and Passages leading to the City, to be
taken up by his Cavalry, and afterwards by making
a Line of Circumvallation, to cut off all Commu∣nication
betwixt the Garrison and the Country.
But having not long after received certain Intel∣ligence,
that the Place being provided with great
store of all Necessaries, this Attempt would in all
likelihood prove abortive, they alter'd their▪ Reso∣lution,
it being judged most advisable, to change
the Blockado into a formal Siege.</P>
<P>For which purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sigismund <HI>besieges</HI> Smolen∣sko.</NOTE> the King having ordered his
Cannon for Battery, and other Instruments for a
Siege to be carried thither out of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the
City was besieged in due form. The King's attack
was carried on, on the West-side of the place, his
quarters extending from the Banks of the River
<HI>Borysthenes</HI> to the South. The attack of the <HI>Cosacks</HI>
was on the East-side, their Quarters reaching from
the South to the same River. The Sieur <HI>Potocki,</HI>
Palatine of <HI>Braclow,</HI> had his Post assigned him on
the North-side; on the opposite shoar of the <HI>Bory∣sthenes,</HI>
to prevent any Succours from coming to the
Relief of the Town that way. But the Besiegers
advanced but slowly in their Works for want of
Foot; for, tho' the King had late<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y received a re∣inforcement
of five thousand <HI>Cosacks,</HI> yet there
being not above ten thousand Foot in his whole
Army (which according to the Custom of the <HI>Po∣landers,</HI>
was chiefly composed of Horse) these bear∣ing
no proportion to so numerous a Garrison, they
were continually harrassed by the frequent Sallies
of the Besieged, who often drove them from their
Trenches, before they could be seconded by their
Horse. Their approaches being thus carried on,
not without great difficulty, a considerable time
was spent, before they could possess themselves of
some advantageous Posts near the Walls of the
City, which being very convenient for the Besieg∣ers
<PB N="85" REF="182"/>
to fetch in their Supplies of fresh Water, put
them to some Distress that way, yet not so, but
that they had sufficient Opportunity to furnish
themselves with it in the night-time, without be∣ing
perceived by the Enemy, by reason of the
nearness of the River. Thus the Siege continued
with abundance of Toil, but small Success; the
King, who now began to be sensible of his Error,
being resolved upon a Punctilio of Honour, not
to leave the Place till it were reduced, cost it what
it would; so that many of the <HI>Poles,</HI> but especial∣ly
of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> paid with their Lives for their
King's Obstinacy, who might have been employed
with much more Probability of Success against the
City of <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>For, whilst the King was thus wasting his Forces
before <HI>Smolensko;</HI> the <HI>Zuskians</HI> having received Ad∣vice
of the approach of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Troops, sent
to their Assistance, began to concert measures how
to remove at a further distance the <HI>Demetrian</HI>
Forces, that had lain so long at their Doors. They
were not ignorant of the Inconveniencies, which
the <HI>Poles</HI> labour'd under in the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp.
They had sufficient Intelligence of their Divisions
and Animosities in their Councils, occasioned by
the Multitude of their Chief Commanders, who
being sway'd more by their particular Interest and
Ambition, than the Good of the common Cause,
lost many times an Opportunity of annoying the
Enemy. This Instability in their Councils, caused
much Carelesness in the whole Conduct of their
Affairs, which frequently turn'd to their great Dis∣advantage,
as it happned in <HI>May</HI> in the same Year,
when a sharp Engagement hapning betwixt the
Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Musco</HI> and the <HI>Demetri∣ans,</HI>
these had at first the better of them; but
making a disorderly Retreat, without the least ne∣cessity,
and falling to plunder the Dead, gave the
Enemy opportunity to Rally, and being reinforced
with fresh Troops out of the City, they so furious∣ly
charged the <HI>Poles,</HI> that they entirely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outed
<PB N="86" REF="183"/>
them, most of their Foot being either kill'd or
taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>The Disgrace they received not long after at
<HI>Twere</HI> must chiefly be ascribed to their divided
Counsels; For the <HI>Poles,</HI> having got Intelligence
that the <HI>Swedish</HI> Auxiliaries were marching towards
<HI>Musco,</HI> sent <HI>Zlarowski</HI> with three thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orse
to observe their Motion, and to annoy them, if pos∣sible,
in their March. <HI>Zlarowski</HI> having had the good
Fortune to surprize one of their Regiments, which
was advanced at some distance before the rest▪ he
cut them all to pieces; This so alarm'd the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI>
who had put all the Hopes of their Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety
in these Auxiliary Troops, that they march'd out
with their whole Strength, and join'd them near
the City of <HI>Twere.</HI> The <HI>Poles,</HI> having got Notice
of their March, sent also a considerable Reinforce∣ment
to <HI>Zlarowski,</HI> who meeting them some▪ few
Miles beyond <HI>Twere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Engage∣ment be∣twixt the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Musco∣vites</HI> near <HI>Twere.</HI></NOTE> a fierce Engagement ensued,
both Parties disputing the Victory with great Ob∣stinacy;
The <HI>Polish</HI> Horse attack'd the two Wings
of the Enemies with an irresistible Courage, and
the <HI>Russians</HI> fighting for the last Stake, behaved
themselves like Men resolv'd either to overcome or
die; notwithstanding which, they were forced to
give Ground, both Wings being after a bloody and
obstinate Fight routed by the <HI>Poles,</HI> who killed
8000 (among whom were 1000 <HI>German</HI> Horse▪)
upon the Spot. But the Foot stood all this while
unmovable, and had several times made <HI>Zla∣rowski,</HI>
who commanded the main Body of the
<HI>Polish</HI> Army, give Ground, and tho' now left by
their Horse, had possest themselves of an advan∣tageous
Post, where they could not be attack'd
without great Disadvantage. The <HI>Polish</HI> Horse
being extreamly tired by the Fatigues of the Day,
and the whole Army much inferiour in Number
to that of the Enemy, it was not thought advisa∣ble
to pursue them; but on the contrary, all the
ablest and most experienced Officers were of O∣pinion
to rest contented with what Advantage
<PB N="87" REF="183"/>
they had gotten, and to withdraw to some more
advantageous Post. But <HI>Zlarowski,</HI> emulo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of
the Honour the rest had goten, would by no means
consent to their Advice, and being resolved to try
his Fortune, whether he could in some Measure
recover the Disgrace he had received in that day's
Action, would not stir from his Post tho' ex∣pos'd
to the Enemies Cannon. So that the rest see∣ing
him resolute, and obstinate against their Coun∣sels
they quartered themselves in some of the ad∣jacent
Villages. The Enemy having by some De∣serters,
got notice what Effects their divided
Counsels had produced, soon rally'd their Horse▪
and having rejoined their Foot, by break of Day▪
fell with such Fury upon the <HI>Poles,</HI> that seeing
themseves thus surprized, and in no Capacity to
second one another, they fought their Way thro'
the Enemy, the Foot retiring to <HI>Twere,</HI> the Horse
making the best of their Way to their Camp near
<HI>Musco,</HI> with the loss of a great many of their
Companions, and all their Artillery and Bag∣gage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites▪</HI> flush'd with this happy Success,
march'd directly to <HI>Twere,</HI> where they stormed the
Castle at three several times with more Courage
than Conduct; for the <HI>Polish</HI> Foot which got be∣fore
them within the Place, repulsed them every
time with great Slaughter; so that, despairing of
carrying the Place, by reason of its numerous
Garrison, they raised the Siege, and directed their
march towards the River <HI>Wolga.</HI></P>
<P>At some Miles distance from <HI>Kolasinum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther Engage∣ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> near <HI>Kolasi∣num.</HI></NOTE> they
were encounter'd by a great Body of the <HI>Demetrian</HI>
Horse, who falling in their Rear, brought the
whole Arrier-guard in Confusion, till seconded by
some fresh Regiments they forced the <HI>Poles</HI> to re∣tire.
Besides this, the Licentiousness of their Disci∣pline
in the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp, had occasioned several
Seditions for want of Pay; so that <HI>Demetrius,</HI> to
satisfie their Demands, was forced to lay such hea∣vy
Taxations upon the Provinces which had sub∣mitted
<PB N="88" REF="184"/>
to his Obedience, that at last becoming in∣tolerable,
most of the great Cities revolted, and
the Country refused to pay any further Contribu∣tions,
looking upon them as the Fuel that nourish∣ed
the Flame which had almost consumed them.
In some Places they grew so outrageous as to seize,
imprison and kill the Tax-gatherers. <HI>Demetrius</HI>
therefore to maintain his Authority and to pro∣tect
his Officers, being obliged to send strong
Parties into several Parts of the Country, his For∣ces
in the Camp were consequently reduced to so
small▪ a Number, as not to suffice to check the
strong Sallies made by those of the City, much less
to hinder them from being supplied with all man∣ner
of Necessaries out of the Country; which
having been several times attempted by the
<HI>Poles,</HI> they were as often baffled by the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI>
always much superiour to them in Num∣ber,
and becoming every day more courageous,
both by the Assistance of their Foreign Auxiliaries,
and their Success against the <HI>Poles,</HI> whose General
<HI>Rosinski,</HI> in one of the Sallies, the Dispute be∣ing
very hot, was shot in his side with an Arrow,
of which he never perfectly recovered. There is
no question, but that if King <HI>Sigismund</HI> could as
yet have been prevailed upon to transfer his Arms
from <HI>Smolensko</HI> to <HI>Musco,</HI> that by his Authority
these Divisions in the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp might have
been soon composed, and the <HI>Muscovites</HI> frighted by
the Accession of so considerable a Force to their
Enemies, to have been brought to better Terms;
but instead of that, he absolutely resolved not to
quit the Place till he had taken it, and his Army
being extreamly weakned by the long Continuance
of the Siege and the frequent Sallies of a numerous
Garrison, and not receiving sufficient Recruits out
of <HI>Poland,</HI> or at least not so opportunely as the ur∣gent
State of his Affairs required, he took a Re∣solution
to draw his Subjects out of the Service of
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> to come to his Aid at the Siege of <HI>Smo∣lensko,</HI>
which entirely ruin'd all his affairs in <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="184"/>
It was in vain, that his ablest Counsellours, re∣presented
to him, that this unseasonable distracting
and weakening the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Party must needs
turn to the great Advantage of <HI>Zuski,</HI> who, when
the City of <HI>Musco</HI> should be delivered of the Ene∣my
that lay at their Gates, would thereby be con∣firm'd
in his Throne; that the circumjacent Pro∣vinces
which were kept in awe by the <HI>Demetrian</HI>
Army, would soon revolt from him, and <HI>Zuski</HI>
thus strengthened by the united Forces of the Em∣pire,
would not fail to come to the Relief of <HI>Smo∣lensko.</HI>
That therefore he ought rather to furnish
<HI>Demetrius</HI> with new Supplies, or at least keep fair
with him, and by no means to distract his Forces
till he had made himself Master of <HI>Smolensko,</HI>
which when taken, he might march without the
Opposition to <HI>Musco;</HI> there being no question but
that all the <HI>Polish</HI> Forces, and the Places in their
Possession, by Promises of great Rewards would
without Reluctancy side with him; which would
infallibly oblige the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to fall off from <HI>Zus∣ki,</HI>
and embrace his Party. It was also call'd in
question, whether the <HI>Poles</HI> would be prevailed
upon to quit <HI>Demetrius,</HI> from whom they expe∣cted
the Rewards of all their Toils and Labours,
especially since the exhausted Treasury of the
Commonwealth of <HI>Poland</HI> was not at present in a
Condition to pay their Arrears.</P>
<P>But the King persisting in his Resolution, sent
some of his Emissaries into the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp,
to endeavour by all means possible to perswade the
<HI>Poles</HI> to abandon the Interest of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and to
join with the King's Forces before <HI>Smolensko.</HI> At
first the King's Agents met with little Encourage∣ment
from the <HI>Poles,</HI> who told them that they
would not by such an untimely Desertion defraud
themselves of the fruit of their Labours, but per∣severe
in their Faith which they had sworn to <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
and sent some Deputies to excuse their not
joining with the King's Forces before <HI>Smolensko.</HI>
But <HI>Sigismund</HI> having promised them their Arrears
<PB N="90" REF="185"/>
to be paid, and brought over <HI>Rosinski</HI> their General,
<HI>Zlarowski,</HI> and some others of the Chief Commanders,
to his side, a great many of the Soldiery promis'd to
to be obedient to the Orders of their King and
Cheif Commanders, and the rest seeing their▪ Affairs
to be in a declining Condition began to waver.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius,</HI> not a little terrified at these▪ Pro∣ceedings
of King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> and fearing, not
without Reason, that these few Troops which
remained faithful to him might scarce be suffi∣cient
to rescue him out of the Hands of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
whom he believed to have an Intention to sacri∣fice
him to their Avarice and Interest, he re∣solved
to withdraw secretly out of the Camp,
and retire to a Place of more Security. But be∣fore
he came to this Extremity, he thought conve∣nient
to try once more, whether by fair Means he
could not prevail upon <HI>Rosinski</HI> to stand stedfast to
his Interest; but this having proved fruitless not∣withstanding
all the most insinuating Rhetorick he
could invent, there pass'd very hot Words be∣twixt
them; <HI>Demetrius</HI> upbraiding him with Trea∣chery
and Breach of his Word; and <HI>Rosinski</HI>
calling <HI>Demetrius</HI> an Impostor, and Son of a Whore.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius,</HI> who would not have brook'd these
Words at another time, was fain to put up
this Affront with Patience, seeing himself not
in a Condition to revenge them;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deme∣trius</HI> with∣draws him∣self.</NOTE> and not thinking
himself any longer secure in a Place where he was
treated with so much Rudeness, he took Horse im∣mediately
after, and with a few of his intimate
Friends retired secretly to <HI>Caluga.</HI> No sooner was
the Flight of <HI>Demetrius</HI> known in the Camp, but
all the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Boyars and Nobles that had e∣spoused
his Interest followed him; and <HI>Marina,</HI>
declared, that having not only wedded the good
Fortune of her Husband but also his Adversities,
she would follow him wherever he went.</P>
<P>The <HI>Polish</HI> Ambassadors employed all their Rhe∣torick,
to perswade her to return into <HI>Poland,</HI>
vainly perswading themselves that her Separation
<PB N="91" REF="185"/>
from <HI>Demetrius,</HI> would be no small Advancement to
King <HI>Sigismund</HI>'s Affairs; but she remain'd unshaken
in her Resolution, neither could she be prevail'd up∣on
to submit herself to the King's Clemency; The
re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erated Perswasions and Prayers of her Fa∣ther▪
and some other of her most intimate Friends
having no further Influence over her Constancy
and haughty Spirit, than to comply thus far with
their Desires, as to write a Letter to King <HI>Sigis∣mund,</HI>
wherein she told him, That tho' she was a∣bandon'd
at this time by most of her Friends, yet
that, as she had long ago been used to the sad Vi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>situde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of Fortune, so she lived still in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opes
that the same God who had so often shewed his
Mercy in delivering her from most imminent Dan∣gers,
and to whom she entirely recommended her∣self
and her Cause, would know his time when to
put a happy End to her Sorrows and Miserie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.
She added, That for the present, being deprived
of all her just Right and Title to the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Throne, she relinquish'd all to his Majesty's Dis∣posal,
and being well satisfied in his Equity and
Generosity, she congratulated his arrival in <HI>Musco∣vy,</HI>
wishing him all the Success imaginable. Atl
last she recommended herself and her Family to his
Royal Protection, promising herself no less from
his Generosity than, under what Circumstances so∣ever,
to be treated by him according to her Dig∣nity.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>Demetrius</HI> his Letters arrived
in the Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny in the <HI>Deme∣trian</HI> Camp.</NOTE> which being read publickly, all was
in an Alarm and Tumult, no body knowing what
Resolution to take; some being for going to <HI>Si∣gismund,</HI>
others for following <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and a
third Party siding with neither, being uncer∣tain
what side to chuse. The general Complaint
was against <HI>Rosinski,</HI> by whose Perfidiousness
they said <HI>Demetrius</HI> had been forced to quit the
Camp, whereby the Soldiers should be deprived
of the Reward of their Blood and Labours.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="186"/>
Marina <HI>taking advantage from their Animosities
and Irresolution, appear'd among them like an∣other
Amazon, and with the Charms of her Words
and Looks, transported them beyond all bounds.
She spoke to all she met, and calling such of the
Commanders, as she knew, by their Names:</HI> Is it
possible, <HI>said she,</HI> that you can be so over-seen as to
flatter your self into a Belief, that <HI>Sigismund</HI> will trou∣ble
himself to reward the Services done to another; It
is from the Great Duke <HI>Demetrius,</HI> you ought to ex∣pect
your Stipend, and the full Reward of all your past
Labours; It is out of the Immense Treasure of the
<HI>Russian</HI> Empire, and the prodigious Riches, gathered
by the present Ʋsurper, and the Plunder of the rebelli∣ous
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> you ought to be recompensed for your
undaunted Courage; All these, if you persist in your
faithfulness to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> will be at your Disposal in
a little Time; for you may rest assured, that he will
think no Recompence too great for those, to whose Fi∣delity
and Courage he shall be Indebted for his
Crown.</P>
<P>These Words were like Fuel, added to a raging
Flame; for a great many of the Soldiers, but e∣specially
the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> declared they would follow
the Fortunes of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and began to pack up
their Baggage, in order to their departure. <HI>Rosin∣ski</HI>
having in vain, endeavoured to disswade them
from their Resolution, caused the Trumpets to be
sounded, being resolved, with a strong Body of
<HI>Polish</HI> Horse, to stop their Passage. But these per∣sisting,
both Parties had recourse to Arms, the <HI>Co∣sacks</HI>
endeavouring to break through the <HI>Polish</HI>
Horse, so that a bloody Conflict ensued, the <HI>Co∣sacks</HI>
fighting like Lions, and the <HI>Poles</HI> having the
Advantage of their Horses, the greatest part of
the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> opened their way with their Swords, and
marched without any further Opposition, direct∣ly
to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> at <HI>Caluga;</HI> some few ran over
to the <HI>Muscovites</HI> in the City; the rest, with their
Commander in Chief, <HI>Zarucki,</HI> were forced to Re∣treat
into the Camp, till a more favourable Oppor∣tunity
<PB N="93" REF="186"/>
should present. There were near two thou∣sand
kill'd in this Engagement on both sides.</P>
<P><HI>Marina,</HI> during this Confusion, seeing she had
effected what she proposed to herself, being dis∣guised
in Man's Apparel, and fearing lest <HI>Rosinski</HI>
should be outragious to her, if she stay'd till the
Engagement was over, she, attended only by a few
trusty <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and one Maid, made her Escape,
and got safe to her Husband at <HI>Caluga.</HI></P>
<P>Before her departure, she writ a Letter, which
she left in trusty Hands, to be communicated, af∣ter
her departure, to the Soldiery; wherein she in∣veighed,
in most bitter Terms, against <HI>Rosinski,</HI>
telling them, that neither her Husband, nor
she being able any longer to resist the Insolence of
the perfidious <HI>Rosinski,</HI> had been forced to seek for
shelter at <HI>Caluga,</HI> that, for her part, nothing should
have induced her to leave the Camp in that Distra∣ction,
if it had not been to save her Honour, her
Fame, and her Life. That she did not question,
but that the Great God the avenger of all Wrongs,
would in due time punish the flagitious Perfidy of
<HI>Rosinski</HI> and his Adherents; and reward the fideli∣ty
of those who remain'd constant to their Vows
and Promises to <HI>Demetrius;</HI> from whom they might
assure themselves of all they could reasonably de∣sire,
after the recovery of his Throne by their
Assistance.</P>
<P>The Words of this Epistle being read to the
Soldiery, sounded in their Ears no otherwise than
an Alarm Bell; every one ran to his Arms, and
the General <HI>Rosinski</HI> saw his Tent surrounded, in an
instant, with whole Troops of threatning Soldiers.
<HI>Is it thee,</HI> cry'd they, <HI>Rosinski, that hast by thy Villa∣nies
and Insolence, forced the injured</HI> Marina <HI>to follow
her Husband? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Is it thee, that by thy Perfideousness, hast
betray'd us, to rob us of the due Rewards of our La∣bours?
Either restore us our Prince, or be sure thou
shalt not escape the hands of Justice;</HI> They had no
sooner spoke these Words, but they made several
shots with their Pistols at him, so that, seeing him∣self
<PB N="94" REF="187"/>
in the utmost danger, he made his escape into
another Quarter. The revolted Party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose imme∣diately
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Tiskevitz</HI> for their General, dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing
publickly, that they would follow their old Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
<HI>Demetrius;</HI> and cut all in pieces that should op∣pose
them. But, by the Authority and Vigilance
of their new General, and the rest of their Chief
Officers, they were appeased for that time. But
not many days were past, when it having been
spread about the Camp (as it is believed by some
of <HI>Demetrius</HI>'s Messengers) that it was not safe to
tarry longer there, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of an Enemy, who
questionless, would improve these Divisions and
Animosities, to his Advantage; and, if not pre∣vented
by their sudden Retreat, make himself a
bloody Arbitrator of their Intestine Dissensions.
The consideration of so imminent a Danger, raised
the Fury of the Soldiers to the highest pitch, who
cry'd out aloud, that <HI>Rosinski</HI> intended to sacrifice
them to his Ambition, and that they would be∣gone
immediately, and so they fell to packing up
their Baggage.</P>
<P>But it having been wisely considered, that if
they should march out in separate Bodies, the E∣nemy
might easily intercept their Passage, or at
least, be very troublesome to them in their March;
wherefore, it was resolved, by mutual Consent, to
keep together till they came to <HI>Volock,</HI> where eve∣ry
body should be at his disposal, to take what way
he found most convenient for his Purpose.</P>
<P>According to this Resolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>De∣metrian</HI> Campbroke up.</NOTE> they set Fire to
their Camp, which for the regularity of its Streets,
variety of Structures, and all other Conveniencies,
resembled rather a great City, than a Camp; all
which being s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on consumed by the Flames, they
marched in good Order, with their Cannon, Bag
and Baggage, to the abovementioned Place: where
<HI>Rosinski</HI> and <HI>Zlarowski,</HI> with some thousand Horse,
and the remnants of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> having declared
for King <HI>Sigismund; Sapiha,</HI> with all his Men, and
such others as were resolved to follow the Fortune
<PB N="95" REF="187"/>
of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> directed their March to <HI>Caluga,</HI>
where they were received with all the demonstrati∣ons
of Joy, their Fidelity deserved.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> in the City had sufficient Information
of the Dissentions that reign'd in the Camp, which
they fomented under hand, keeping themselves
close within their Walls all this while; for fear, if
they should attack them, they might become sen∣sible
of their Error, and by the common danger
that threatned them, be re-united for their mutual
Security; which succeeded so well, that they saw
the same puissant Army, which had given Laws to
the whole Empire, for the space of two Years,
and reduced the Capital City it self, to the last Ex∣tremity,
to moulder away to nothing, by the in∣testine
Dissensions of their Generals, and the care∣lesness
of their Martial Discipline; but more especi∣ally
by the mismanagement of <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of
<HI>Poland;</HI> who by the unseasonable Distractions, oc∣casioned
by his recalling the <HI>Poles</HI> out of the <HI>De∣metrian</HI>
Camp, was the chief Instrument of the
Deliverance of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> to his great Detri∣ment;
for, the Enemy, who before was scarce
able to maintain himself within the Walls of <HI>Mus∣co,</HI>
being now freed from that Thorn that stuck so
deep in his Flesh, soon gathered new Strength; for
that the King, who might, if he had given due En∣couragement
to have <HI>Demetrius,</HI> prosecuted the War
at the Expence and Danger of others, or at least,
have shared both with them, by his obstinate
Perseverance in the Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> drew the
whole Burthen of the War upon his own Shoulders,
and thus robb'd himself of the Glory and Advantage
of making himself the Arbitrator betwixt both the
contending Parties. This memorable Siege was
rais'd in the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> in the Year 1610.</P>
<P>The Citizens of <HI>Musco</HI> seeing themselves thus de∣liver'd
from their troublesome Neighbours, began
now to assume new Courage and Vigour, and ha∣ving
driven the <HI>Poles</HI> out of <HI>Peresla</HI> and <HI>Alexandria▪</HI>
most of the Provinces which were revolted to <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="188"/>
now again declared for <HI>Zuski,</HI> offering
considerable Supplies, and promising their utmost
Assistance in chasing the <HI>Poles</HI> out of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zuski,</HI> having conceived new Hopes of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccess
from the Zeal of his Subjects, march'd to the Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
<HI>Wolga,</HI> where he recover'd all the Places as yet in
the Possession of the <HI>Demetrians,</HI> and forced <HI>Sapiha</HI>
(who, as we mention'd before, remain'd stedfast
in the Interest of <HI>Demetrius)</HI> to raise the Siege of
the strong Convent of <HI>Troitza.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rosinski,</HI> after his Separation from <HI>Sapiha</HI> and the
rest of the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Forces, had possess'd himself
of <HI>Volock</HI> and the strong Convent of <HI>Ossipow,</HI> both
which he had provided with a good Garrison, ha∣ving
sent the rest of his Troops under the Com∣mand
of <HI>Zlarowski</HI> to the King of <HI>Poland</HI> before
<HI>Smolensko.</HI> He himself, was by reason of an Indi∣sposition
occasioned by a hurt he received before
<HI>Musco,</HI> detained at <HI>Volock;</HI> His Distemper increa∣sing
every day, by reason of the Distraction of his
Mind, created by his late ill Successes, he was at
last overcome, more by the Violence of his Grief,
than of his Malady, which deprived him of his
Life in a strange Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rosinski <HI>dyes.</HI></NOTE> at that very time when
the <HI>Zuskians</HI> were approaching the Place in order to
besiege it.</P>
<P><HI>Volviowitz,</HI> the <HI>Zuskian</HI> General, having soon re∣ceived
Intelligence of the Death of <HI>Rosinski,</HI> hast∣ned
his March, and having immediately caused the
Town to be attacked with Vigour, the Garrison all
in a Distraction by the Death of their General, sur∣render'd
it in a few Days, without making any con∣siderable
Resistance.</P>
<P>From thence he turn'd his Arms to <HI>Ossipo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
which he also took, but not without great Diffi∣culty,
and the Loss of a great many of his Men.
For, this Place being garrison'd by a thousand
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> they beat off the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
in several bloody Assaults, and obliged them to
turn the Siege into a Blockade, which having redu∣ced
the Garrison to the last Extremity for want of
<PB N="97" REF="188"/>
all manner of Necessaries, they took a Resolution ra∣ther
to force their way with their Swords in their
Hands thro' the Enemies than tamely to surrender up∣on
dishonourable Conditions. They chose Midnight as
the fittest time for the Exploit, when, having refresh∣ed
themselves with what Provisions there was left,
and having taken their farewel of one another by
Embraces, and drinking each a Cup of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI>
they made a Sally out of the Gate which leads to
<HI>Smolensko,</HI> and like Men resolved to die, attacked
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> in their Posts, with an unparallel'd
Bravery, of whom a great many were kill'd before
they could be relieved by fresh Troops; when their
Number increasing continually, they kill'd most of
the Garrison (but not without great Slaughter on
their side) two hundred only escaping to King <HI>Si∣gismund</HI>'s
Camp; And the rest sold their lives so
dearly, that some thousands of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were
slain upon the Place.</P>
<P>In the mean while the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had made
several fruitless Attacks upon the City of <HI>Smolensko,</HI>
the Garrison of which Place defended it self with
a most gallant Resolution. The Attempt which
was made at the Gate of S. <HI>Michael</HI> by one <HI>No∣wodorski</HI>
a <HI>Polander</HI> and Captain of the King's
Guards, deserves among the rest a particular Re∣membrance
here. For he, having fastned a Petard
to the abovementioned Gate, laid open a Passage
into the Town, and with a few young <HI>Polish</HI> No∣blemen
entred the City with their Scymetars
drawn, cutting down all before them; There is no
question but that if they had been vigorously secon∣ded
by the rest, the Place must have infallibly
fallen into the Hands of King <HI>Sigismund;</HI> But
most of them not daring to follow, he and his
small Company were over-powered by the great
Number of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who flock'd to the
Defence of the Gate; yet they made good their
Retreat, with the Loss of two only of their Com∣panions,
leaving behind them most evident Proofs
of their Valour among the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> They being
<PB N="98" REF="189"/>
now forewarn'd, took care to block up their Gates
with Earth, and making deep Trenches before them
to prevent their being surprized upon the same Ac∣count
for the future.</P>
<P><HI>Zuski,</HI> being flush'd with the variety of these Suc∣cesses,
and having got together an Army of above
fifty thousand Men, all chosen Troops, a great ma∣ny
of them being <HI>Germans, Swedes,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI>
was resolved to push on his Fortune, and, if pos∣sible,
to clear <HI>Muscovy,</HI> both of its foreign and
domestick Enemies. If he had bent his whole
Force against <HI>Demetrius</HI> who at that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>time lay with
the Remnants of his Army near <HI>Caluga,</HI> there is
no question but that he might have destroyed him
and his Party past all Recovery; but despising his
small Number, he committed the Care of them to
his <HI>Tartarian</HI> Troops, whilst he with the main Ar∣my
march'd to the Relief of <HI>Smolensko.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Sigismund</HI> having received timely Intelli∣gence
of their Design was not unprepared for their
Reception, and having sent <HI>Stanislaus Zolkievitski</HI>
with ten thousand Men, to take Possession of some
advantageous Posts near <HI>Clusin,</HI> he resolved there
to expect the Enemy. Not many days were past
before the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were advanced within sight
of the <HI>Poles,</HI> when pursuant to a Resolution taken
in a Council of War, the whole Army was drawn
out in order of Battle to attack in their Advan∣tage.</P>
<P>The left Wing of the <HI>Zuskian</HI> Army was com∣posed
of <HI>Muscovites;</HI> the Right, of <HI>Swedes, French,</HI>
and a good Number of <HI>Tartarian</HI> Horse, the
main Body consisting most of <HI>Germans,</HI> and some
other mercenary Soldiers. The <HI>Poles</HI> were much
inferiour in Number to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> but trusting
upon their Courage and the Advantage of the Ground
they received the Enemy with great Bravery, who
confiding in their Number attack'd them with incre∣dible
Fury. The Fight was very bloody, and re∣mained
doubtful for some Part of the day; for
tho' the <HI>Poles</HI> soon routed the Left Wing com∣manded
<PB N="99" REF="189"/>
by the Brother of <HI>Zuski,</HI> yet the <HI>Swedes</HI>
and the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the Right fought it out very gal∣lantly
and the <HI>Germans</HI> in the main Body being plac'd
upon a Ground full of Shrubs and other Rubbage,
where the <HI>Polish</HI> Horse could not advance without
great Difficulty, repulsed them several times with
great Slaughter; till at last the Right Wing of the
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Army being brought first into Confusion,
and afterwards totally routed; the <HI>German</HI> Foot
seeing themselves deprived of the Assistance of their
Horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zuski <HI>rou∣ted.</HI></NOTE> and on all sides surrounded by the <HI>Poles,</HI>
gave the Signal for Parley, which being readily
granted by King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> and the Hostages inter∣changed,
it was agreed▪ that such as should be wil∣ling
to enter into Pay in the <HI>Polish</HI> Army should
be entertained by the King according to their respe∣ctive
Stations, the rest to remain Prisoners of War.</P>
<P>Scarce had the Treaty been signed, and was
just upon the Point of being executed, when <HI>De la
Garde,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Swedish</HI> Auxiliaries
in Hopes that the <HI>German</HI> Foot had maintained
their Ground, having rallied the Wings that were
broken before, returned to the place of Battle, but
being informed of what had pass'd, he intreated
the <HI>Germans</HI> to return in Conjunction with the
Horse to the Charge. But these were deaf to all
his Admonitions and Perswasions, declaring that
they would not be guilty of the Breach of the
Treaty so lately made with the <HI>Poles,</HI> who there∣upon
afresh attack'd the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Horse, entirely
routed them a second time and after a Pursuit of
some Hours, made themselves Masters of their
Camp, Artillery and Baggage.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>German</HI> Foot having taken Service
under King <HI>Sigismund,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Zus∣kians</HI> rou∣ted a se∣cond time.</NOTE> he to terrifie the Garrison of
<HI>Smolensko,</HI> ordered a most solemn Triumph to be
made in the Camp, where a great Number of Cap∣tives,
Colours and other Warlike Ensigns of his
late obtained Victory, were exposed to the View
of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> within the City unto whom ha∣ving
at the same time caused to represent the irre∣coverable
<PB N="100" REF="190"/>
Loss of <HI>Zuski</HI> and his Party, after so sig∣nal
an overthrow, he assured them, that if they did
not make use of this last Offer the King intended
to make them of deserving his Mercy; they must
infallibly expect to be involved in his Ruin. Most of
the Inhabitants shewed a great Inclination to a sur∣render
upon such honourable terms as were offered
by King <HI>Sigismund;</HI> But <HI>Sehin</HI> their Weywode being
a Man of an undaunted Courage, would not hear∣ken
to any Propositions tho' never so advanta∣geous;
and having represented to them that their
Condition was such as to be able to stop the Car∣reer
of the Victorious <HI>Poles,</HI> and to their eternal
Glory, to deserve the Honour of having upheld the
declining Fate of their Country against its mortal
Enemies, they unanimously resolved to defend them∣selves
to the last Extremity.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> began to feel the
direful Effects of the loss of this Battle; For, <HI>Sapiha</HI>
(now the <HI>Demetrian</HI> General) had routed the <HI>Mus∣covian
Tartars,</HI> near <HI>Twitza,</HI> and cut to pieces ano∣ther
considerable Body of their Troops at <HI>Borowsko;</HI>
King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> having got notice, that <HI>Volviowitz</HI>
the <HI>Zuskian</HI> General was, after the last Defeat▪ retir'd
with a Body of ten thousand Men under <HI>Czarow,</HI>
sent thither part of his Army, the very sight of
which, so terrified the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> that without
striking one Blow, they surrendred to the Conque∣rour's
discretion; the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Army began to ap∣proach
a second time their Capital City, and the <HI>Poles</HI>
had detatch'd a considerable Body from the Siege of
<HI>Smolensko,</HI> whom they expected to see every day at
their Gates. The worst of all was, that in the last
Battle, they had lost the Flower of their Army, and
most of their Foreign Auxiliaries, in whom they most
confided, the <HI>Germans</HI> having taken Service among
the <HI>Poles;</HI> so that, having not the least prospect of
repairing their ruined Troops, nor any other Means
left to defend themselves against the Power of two
Armies, that were on their march to besiege them
more closly than ever, they were at the greatest
<PB N="101" REF="190"/>
Plunge, how to extricate themselves out of these
impending Miseries.</P>
<P>After various Debates among the Nobles, who
most took to Heart the present miserable State of
their Country, they had recourse to the same States
Policy, which had prov'd successful to their Affairs
before, to wit, to try whether by raising new Di∣visions
among the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Demetrians,</HI> they
might not find once more an Opportunity to save
themselves from this imminent Danger, which, if
not soon prevented, threatned their infallible De∣struction.
To encompass this Design, it was pro∣posed
to seize upon the Great Duke <HI>Basili Zuski</HI> and
to give it out that they were resolved to put <HI>Ʋla∣dislaus,</HI>
the Son of <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> upon
the Throne of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> that thereby they should
infallibly ruin the Interest of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and con∣sequently
rid themselves of a vile Impostor, whose
very Name was become odious to them, and at the
same time, restore immediately Peace to their harras∣sed
Country. It was represented, that, tho' they ought
to look upon the <HI>Poles,</HI> as their most dreadful and
mortal Enemies, that nevertheless, their only Busi∣ness
being now to get time, and to breath a little;
the <HI>Poles,</HI> inveigled by their fair Promises, would
soon become secure, and furnish them with an op∣portunity,
either quite to elude the Election of <HI>Ʋ∣ladislaus,</HI>
or, if that was not thought advisable, they
might find sufficient Means, at one time or other,
to rid their hands of him, under pretence of his
Childhood, which, if well tim'd, they might make
use of so favourable a Juncture, to endeavour to
return their Government into its antient Channel,
from whence it had been diverted by the Artifices
of their Enemies, and had been the occasion of all
the Miseries they had endured of late. This De∣sign,
laid upon deep Reasons of State, succeeded
at last according to their Expectation, by the mis∣management
of the <HI>Poles▪</HI> who were, by the good
Conduct of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> not long after, obliged
to leave that Empire, and restore to it that Repose,
<PB N="102" REF="191"/>
which with vast Expences, and the effusion of a
great deal of Blood, they had robb'd it of, for
near twenty years before. The <HI>Muscovian</HI> Boyars,
and Nobles, having thus concerted measures among
themselves, according to which, the Ruin of <HI>Zus∣ki</HI>
was resolved on, as the only means to encom∣pass
the intended Deliverance of their native Coun∣try,
it was by their Instigation whisper'd about
among the Populace, how that <HI>Basili Zuski,</HI> the
present Great Duke, ought to be considered, as
the Chief Author of all their Misfortunes, who by
his Sorceries and Tyranny, had drawn down upon
the People of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> the vengeance of God Al∣mighty;
and that by his Miscarriages, they were
again plung'd into these Miseries, wherewith they
saw themselves environed past all Redemption,
unless they took new measures for their common
Safety.</P>
<P><HI>Zuski</HI> had, since his accession to the Crown, ren∣dered
his Government very obnoxious to the Cen∣sures
of the Nobles; For, having mounted the
Throne, by Blood and fraudulent Means, he be∣gan
to be jealous of his most trusty Friends, and,
to gratifie his Fears, exercised his Cruelties upon se∣veral
Persons of an eminent Rank, whom he caused
to be put to Death upon no other Pretence, than
his having secret Intelligence of their Unfaithful∣ness.
As his Reign was one continued Series of
Troubles, so when he was at a Plunge, he used to
have recourse to Sorcerers and Witchcraft, and be∣ing
infatuated by their Perswasions, he committed
such Barbarities as are scarce to be named without
horror. It was upon this account, he caused the
Wombs of big-bellied Women, to be ript open,
to make use of the immature Fruit, to accomplish
his Enchantments, which, he was vainly perswa∣ded,
would be more efficacious against the <HI>Poles,</HI>
than his Sword. Some of his Wizzards having
foretold him, that one, whose name was <HI>Michael,</HI>
should succeed him in the Throne, he caused three
of his most faithful Friends and Servants to be made
<PB N="103" REF="191"/>
away, for no other reason, but because they bore
that name, which for all his barbarous Precautions,
was verified in the Person of <HI>Mich. Federowitz,</HI> the
present Czar's Grandfather. There were in the great
Church within the Castle, amongst other Things of
great Value, thirteen Statues, representing our Sa∣viour
and the twelve Apostles, all of massie Gold,
each of them of the bigness of a Man, valued at
near three hundred thousand Pounds Sterling.
<HI>Zuski</HI> being at last reduced to great Straights for
want of Money, and having, in vain, try'd all the
Skill of his Sorcerers, who were not able to supply
his present Occasions, he had recourse to the twelve
Apostles, whom he displaced from their Station in
the Church, and having caused them to be melted
down, made use of the Metal for the Payment of his
Soldiers. He had so much Grace as to spare the
Statue of our Saviour, which the <HI>Poles,</HI> not long
after, converted to the same use.</P>
<P>All these Enormities, being now by the Nobles,
who had conspir'd his Ruin, improved to his dis∣advantage,
the Populace (whose Darling he was
before) prompted more by their Zeal for their
golden Statues, than the Love and Welfare of their
Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zuski <HI>de∣posed.</HI></NOTE> soon shook hands with the Nobility; and
seeing <HI>Demetrius</HI> to meditate a second time the Siege
of their Capital City, they, with the same unani∣mous
Consent, wherewith they had raised him be∣fore
to the Throne, pull'd him down again, and
thrust him, with his two Brothers, into a Cloy∣ster.</P>
<P>This done, they sent their Deputies to <HI>Zolkievitz∣ski,</HI>
the <HI>Polish</HI> General, who commanded that Body,
which was approaching to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> unto
whom they promised to chuse <HI>Ʋladislaus,</HI> the Prince
of <HI>Poland,</HI> for their Great Duke, provided he
would defend them against <HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zolkievitzki,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poles</HI> admitted in to the City of <HI>Musco.</HI></NOTE> gladly accepting of their Propositi∣ons,
detatch'd immediately a good Body of his best
Troops, who being readily admitted into the City,
he followed in few days after with the whole Army,
<PB N="104" REF="192"/>
pitching his Tents on the East side of the City; as
<HI>Demetrius</HI> was encamped on the Western part.
Some time being spent in Consultations, betwixt
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> the first opened their
Gates to the last, so that <HI>Zolkievitzki,</HI> marching
with his whole Army through the City, fix'd his
Camp near to that of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who, tho' not a lit∣tle
surprised at this sudden and near approach of the
<HI>Poles,</HI> yet was forced to put the best Countenance
he could upon the Matter, and to smother his pre∣sent
Resentment.</P>
<P>There being thus a communication, and seeming
friendly Correspondence maintain'd betwixt both
Camps, <HI>Zulkievitzki</HI> found it no very difficult Task
to debauch that Body of <HI>Polish</HI> Horse, Commanded
by <HI>Spiaha,</HI> which hitherto had remain'd stedfast in
the Interest of <HI>Demetrius;</HI> These having received
the publick Faith of the Commonwealth of <HI>Poland</HI>
for the Payment of all their Arrears, unanimously
revolted, and declared for King <HI>Sigismund.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zarucki,</HI> the General of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and <HI>Kasi∣nowski,</HI>
Prince of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that served in the
<HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp, both intimate Friends of <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
seeing themselves thus deprived of the
assistance of the <HI>Polish</HI> Horse, the main strength of
their Army, and that the City of <HI>Musco</HI> was de∣fended
by a great Body of <HI>Poles,</HI> both within and
without its Walls, began now to despair of the
Fortune of <HI>Demetrius;</HI> and thinking it not advisa∣ble
to involve themselves in his Ruine, they re∣solved
to embrace the Party of the Conquering
<HI>Pole,</HI> expecting to reap from the Success of <HI>Sigis∣mund,</HI>
the Fruits of their past Labours.</P>
<P>Whilst these were preparing to wait upon the
King before <HI>Smolensko,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Demetri∣us</HI> retreats from be∣fore <HI>Mus∣co.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Demetrius</HI> forsaken not only
by the <HI>Poles,</HI> but also by them he most confided in,
and seeing himself and his Affairs exposed to Di∣spair,
sought once more for Refuge at <HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ga,</HI>
which, having served him as a Shelter before, now
received him again with open Arms.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="192"/>
The <HI>Muscovites,</HI> being thus freed from <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
would fain have recalled their former Promise of
Electing <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> their Great Duke, alledging that
they could not proceed to his Election till he were
present in Person, to confirm to them by Oath, the
maintenance of their Religion and Ancient Cu∣stoms.
But <HI>Zolkievitzki,</HI> having declared in the
Name of King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> that he would not quit
the City with his Army till he saw Prince <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI>
seated upon the Throne, and that therefore he ex∣horted
them to fulfil their solemn Promise without
any further Tergeversations, unless they would ex∣pose
their Capital City to inevitable Destruction;
and that he was ready to swear to such Articles in the
Great Duke's Name, as should be agreed betwixt
them; they judged it most adviseable not to exaspe∣rate
the <HI>Poles,</HI> who at present had two potent Ar∣mies
one in the very Bowels of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI>
the other in the Empire before <HI>Smolensko.</HI></P>
<P>These Considerations at last prevailing over the
Aversion they had against the <HI>Poles,</HI> and being per∣swaded
that the Childhood of <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> could not
but furnish them, in a little time, with an Oppor∣tunity
of ridding their Hands of him, as they had
done of both the <HI>Demetrius</HI>'s, they proceeded with
all the usual Solemnities to the Election.</P>
<P>The chief Conditions were; That a general Am∣nesty
and Act of Oblivion should be passed; and
all their Ancient Customs and Privileges confirmed
and established.</P>
<P>That the new Great Duke <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> should,
with all convenient Speed, come in Person into
<HI>Russia.</HI></P>
<P>That he should conserve their Religion inviola∣ble,
and for the better Settlement of the same and
the whole Kingdom, abjure the <HI>Roman Catholick</HI>
Faith, and embrace the <HI>Greek</HI> Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Zolkievitzki</HI> and some of the great Officers of
the <HI>Polish</HI> Army having confirmed these Articles by
Oath in the Name of the new Great Duke, he was,
tho' absent, proclaimed with the usual Ceremonies

and Fealty sworn to him by all the Boyars,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Uladislaus</HI> proclaimed Great Duke.</NOTE> Nobles,

Joy, and the Acclamations of the People.</P>
<P>As a further Pledge of their Fidelity, and to re∣move
all the Shadow of Dissimulation from them∣selves,
they sacrificed <HI>Zuski</HI> and his two Brothers
to the present Exigency of the State, who were
surrendred into the Hands of <HI>Zolkievitzki,</HI> and by
his direction sent to <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of <HI>Poland▪</HI>
where the unfortunate <HI>Zuski,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zuski</HI> sur∣render'd to the <HI>Poles.</HI></NOTE> with one of his Bro∣thers,

<P><HI>ZOlkievitzki,</HI> the <HI>Polish</HI> General, having in the
Name of the new Great Duke <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> ta∣ken
Possession of the Castle of <HI>Musco,</HI> and the
Royal Palace, with a Guard of a Thousand <HI>Poles,</HI>
it was unanimously resolved to send a splendid
Ambassy to King <HI>Sigismund</HI> before <HI>Smolensko,</HI> to
make a Tender of the Crown of <HI>Muscovy</HI> to his Son
<HI>Ʋladislaus,</HI> and to desire his Confirmation of the
Articles agreed on betwixt the <HI>Russians</HI> and the <HI>Po∣lish</HI>

<P><PB N="107" REF="193"/>
The Ambassy being composed of some of the
Chief Boyars of the Empire, attended with a most
magnificent and numerous Train; they were re∣ceived
with more than ordinary Honour by King
<HI>Sigismund,</HI> who sent out the whole Body of Horse
from before <HI>Smolensko,</HI> with all the great Officers
of the Army, and his Courtiers, to receive them at
some Distance from the Camp.</P>
<P>Being introduced into the King's Presence, they
addressed themselves in a Speech full of Flattery
and Dissimulation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Musco∣vites</HI> ten∣der the Crown to <HI>Uladislaus.</HI></NOTE> under which they hid their se∣cret
Aversion to the <HI>Poles.</HI> They told him how
overjoy'd they were to see that Day which they ho∣ped
would restore Tranquility to their harrassed Coun∣try,
by the Choice they had lately made of his Son
<HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> for their Great Duke, humbly beseech∣ing
the King, that in regard of the near Interest he
now had in their Preservation, he would vouchsafe
to take them and their afflicted Country into his
Royal Protection, as the only Means to revive the
former flourishing State of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire,
which had been reduced to the very Brink of Ruin
by their intestine Divisions. That their late Ele∣ction
having been unanimous and founded upon
Hopes of their future Felicity, they begg'd of his

but to send as soon as possibly might be, their Prince
into <HI>Russia,</HI> in order to let them enjoy the Comfort
of his Presence and Protection, and to compleat
their Election by Crowning him Great Duke and
Emperour, with the usual Ceremonies, in the
Royal City of <HI>Musco.</HI> They related to him the
Conditions upon which he was to be received, as we
have related them in the foregoing Chapter; They
enlarged themselves much in praise of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Religion, and how necessary it would be for the
Prince to accommodate himself to the Rites
of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Church, which they said,
ought to be looked upon as the Foundation-Stone
of that Monarchy, from whence depen∣ded
the common Safety, both of Prince and Peo∣ple;
<PB N="108" REF="194"/>
all which they recommended to his Royal
Wisdom.</P>
<P>King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> who was not ignorant that these
subtle Insinuations proceeded more from the pre∣sent
Necessity of their Affairs, than any good Will
either to himself or the <HI>Polish</HI> Nation, was not
wanting to give them an Answer suitable to the
present Occasion. And having received their Mes∣sage
with a very serene Countenance and seeming
Gladness, he answered them in general Terms;
That he could not but receive the Honour conferr'd
upon his Son by the Offer of the Crown of so great
an Empire with a great deal of Gladness, but that
as the chiefest Satisfaction he took in their Election,
was their unanimous Consent, so he assured them,
that he should look upon it as an indispensible obli∣gation,
to assist at all times hereafter their Country
with his Aids and Counsels, by which means he ho∣ped
a mutual good Correspondency might be esta∣blished
betwixt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se two potent neighbouring
Crowns of <HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> to their mutual
Advantage. And as to what related to the Parti∣culars
of the Treaty, they being of such a Nature
as to deserve a particular Consideration, he would,
after having well weighed the Matter, send his full
Instructions to his General <HI>Zolkievitzki,</HI> Resident in
the City of <HI>Musco,,</HI> with whom the whole Mat∣ter
might be compleated at their own Homes,
to the Satisfaction, as he hoped, of both
Parties.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors being in all outward Appear∣ance
very well satisfied with this Answer, there
passed abundance of Caresses betwixt them and the
<HI>Polish</HI> Lords, by whom they were sumptuously
feasted at sundry times, with such mutual Profes∣sions
of Friendship, as if they had been but one
People; The same Kindness was shewn betwixt
the <HI>Muscovites▪</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI> in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI>
whereby the Inhabitants being inveigled into a pro∣found
Security, the <HI>Poles</HI> found Means by degrees
to creep into the Castle, to the Number of six or
<PB N="109" REF="194"/>
seven thousand, which afterwards proved fatal to
that City.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors having not long after de∣manded
their Audience of Leave from <HI>Sigismund</HI> in
order to their Departure; the King in return
to their Demand, asked from them the Sur∣render
of <HI>Smolensko</HI> in the Name of Prince <HI>Ʋla∣dislaus,</HI>
elected and proclaimed Great Duke of <HI>Rus∣sia;</HI>
unto which they having answered, That they
had nothing of it in their Instructions, and that
they were of Opinion the <HI>Russians</HI> would be unwil∣ling
to surrender a Place of such Importance
till the Great Duke were come in Person to the Ca∣pital
City, and Crowned and sworn to the Perfor∣mance
of the beforementioned Articles, they were
not permitted to depart till further Orders. For,
Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g <HI>Sigismund</HI> having fully weighed the whole
State of the Matter, and especially their Refusal
of the Surrender of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> began to be more
and more convinced of their fraudulent Dealings;
and knowing that it was not their free Choice, but
the absolute Necessity of their Affairs that had rai∣sed
his Son to the Throne, he had all the Reason
to fear, that when he had withdrawn his Forces
out of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> they would make their Advan∣tage
by the Unexperience of his Son, and justle
him out of the Throne. But if he should forbear
to send him till he came to his riper Years, they
would from thence, without question, take Occa∣sion
to recall their Choice, and elect another in his
stead. And, considering that he had reduced them
to such Straights, as had made them take those Mea∣sures
so little suitable to their Incinations, but meerly
invented to disintangle themselves out of their
present Distresses, he looked upon it not only as
inglorious by accepting their Conditions to receive
instead of imposing Laws upon them, but also
quite inconsistent with his own Interest and the
Safety of his Son.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="195"/>
All his Thoughts therefore, were bent upon the
Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> which when taken, he
supposed he might appear among them as a Con∣querour,
and prescribe such Laws to the dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tful
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> as should be most consistent both with
his Honour and Safety. This was the Resolution
of <HI>Sigismund.</HI></P>
<P>But his ablest Counsellors were of a quite diffe∣rent
Opinion; For, tho' they were no less satisfied
in the deceitful Intentions of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> than
the King himself; yet did they not judge it advisa∣ble,
to drive Matters to extremities, and to com∣mit
that to the hazard of the Sword, which might
be obtained without Opposition. They represent∣ed
to the King, that the Conquest of so vast an
Empire, could not be obtained without the effusion
of much Blood, and the Expence of vast Trea∣sures;
whereas, if what had been sworn to by <HI>Zol∣kievitzki,</HI>
by the King's Orders, were confirmed,
he might in one day, make himself Master of all
<HI>Muscovy.</HI> They advised him therefore, not to give
the opportunity to an unstable People to take new
measures, who perhaps, when driven to Despair,
might side with <HI>Demetrius;</HI> which would take a∣way
all his Pretences of invading that Empire,
since he had undertaken his Expedition under the
pretext of assisting him in the Recovery of his
Right; But to send Prince <HI>Ʋladislaus,</HI> assisted by
a good Body of Troops, and some able Counsel∣lors,
to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> where he being receiv'd
and Crown'd Great Duke <HI>Russia,</HI> might with their
Assistance easily elude the Practices of the <HI>Musco∣vites.</HI>
That by this means, <HI>Smolensko</HI> would fall on
course into his Hands, and his Army, besides this,
might be paid all their Arrears out of the Great
Duke's Treasure, as belonging to <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> their
Prince, who else, as the Case now stood; would
be an intolerable Burthen for the Commonwealth
of <HI>Poland.</HI> And as to what related to the Articles,
they might without much Difficulty, be either
quite evaded, or at least delay'd, till the Prince,
<PB N="111" REF="195"/>
strengthened with fresh Supplies out of <HI>Poland,</HI>
should find himself in a Capacity to Rule this false
and stubborn People by such Laws, as he should
judge most convenient, and suitable to his own In∣terest.
But these wholesome Counsels had no
great Influence over the King, who being pre∣possess'd
with a vain Punctilio of Honour, not to
rise from before <HI>Smolensko</HI> before it was taken, and
with the pernicious Insinuation of his Flatterers,
who perswaded him, that the Place was reduced
to that extremity, as not to be able to hold out
long against him, he resolved to leave nothing un∣attempted
which might contribute to the Rendi∣tion,
or forcing of that important City.</P>
<P>For which Reason, he caused a new Battery to
be raised, from whence, and some others the <HI>Poles,</HI>
fired so furiously upon the Town, that after some
time, they laid flat a great Part of the Wall, and
ruined two Bastions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smolen∣sko. <HI>stor∣med.</HI></NOTE> Upon which it was resolved
to assault the Place, which was executed with a
great deal of Bravery; But those within, by rea∣son
of the Numerousness of the Garrison, having
had sufficient time to raise strong Retrenchments,
fortified with Pallisado's, and a good Ditch behind
the Breach, the <HI>Poles</HI> were not able to lodge them∣selves
in the Breach, notwithstanding their reite∣rated
Attacks, made with the greatest Bravery ima∣ginable,
were repulsed with great Slaughter.</P>
<P>After this ill Success of the <HI>Poles,</HI> the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
who hitherto had but murmured and whispered their
Complaints, began to explain publickly against the
Breach of the Articles, the detaining their Am∣bassadors
against the Laws of Nations, and the
Outrages and Insolencies of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who being
got into the entire Possession of the Castle and
Principal Ports of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> committed
Violences upon the Citizens, their Wives and Saints,
at the last of which they shot with their Pistols;
which being a thing intolerable to People infatu∣ated
with Superstition and Zeal for their Images,
would certainly have produced violent Commoti∣ons
<PB N="112" REF="196"/>
among them, at that time, if they had not been
over-aw'd by the great Number of <HI>Poles,</HI> within
the bowels of their own City, and which was the
most prevailing, that they saw <HI>Demetrius</HI> encrease
again in strength at <HI>Caluga.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Zarucki,</HI> the General of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> and
<HI>Kazinowski,</HI> Prince of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who, as we said
before, had left him, at his second Retreat from
before the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> finding their Reception
to bear no proportion with the Reward they pro∣posed
to themselves from King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> and see∣ing
themselves despised by the Nobility of <HI>Poland,</HI>
were since return'd to the Service of <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
who countenanced by their Return, began to look up
again, and having drawn new Supplies out of the
adjacent Places, began to appear formidable at <HI>Ca∣luga,</HI>
and would in all likelihood have once more
appeared in the Field, if he had not been preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed
by his sudden and untimely Death, which hap∣pened
thus:</P>
<P><HI>Kazinowski,</HI> the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Prince, who was late∣ly
return'd to his Service, had given him great Oc∣casion
of suspecting his Fidelity; wherefore <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣metrius,</HI>
to prevent the Design, which he believ'd
to be form'd against his Life by the said <HI>Tartarian</HI>
Prince, caused him to be thrown into the River
<HI>Occa,</HI> and drowned there. The <HI>Tartars,</HI> but espe∣cially
his Guards, enraged at the Death of their
Prince, resolved to revenge it upon <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
with the first Opportunity, which was not long
before they met with it, according to their intend∣ed
Design. For it is to be observed, that <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣trius,</HI>
ever since his last Retreat from before <HI>Mus∣co,</HI>
was grown excessive Melancholy, which he was
used to divert frequently with Drinking, endeavour∣ing
to drown his Cares in Liquor. Having been
one day a Hunting, he retir'd towards night with
some of his most intimate Friends to the Enjoy∣ment
of his Customary Comfort, the Bottle, with∣out
any Guards about him. The <HI>Tartars,</HI> who had
formed the Design against his Life, having got no∣tice
<PB N="113" REF="196"/>
of it, secretly got near to his Quarters, and
finding him and his Friends involved in Liquor,
and a most profound Security,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>slain.</HI></NOTE> broke in upon him,
and slew him and some of his Friends, who endea∣voured
to stop their Entrance, upon the place.</P>
<P>This was the End of this Second <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
who, from a mean and sordid Fortune, was raised
to so eminent a Station as to have bid fair for the
<HI>Russian</HI> Empire, till he met with his deserved
Death among his own Servants and Friends. He
is agreed by all Hands to have been an Impostor,
some affirming his first Origin to have been a
Schoolmaster, others supposing him to have been
a <HI>Jew,</HI> because in his Closet were found several
Hebrew and Talmudical Books, which are Mate∣rials
not belonging to the Profession of the <HI>Russian</HI>
Schoolmasters, whose Learning rarely exceeds Rea∣ding
and Writing.</P>
<P>But whoever he was, it is certain that he was an
Impostor, and slain by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who did not
long escape Vengeance; For, <HI>Marina</HI> had no soo∣ner
received this dismal News, which at one Stroke
robb'd her of all her great Expectations, but, being
seized with the most violent Apprehensions in the
World, and transported with Grief and Rage,
without any Respect to her Quality and Sex, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
her Hair and Face, and thus running into the
Streets, cryed out, like a distracted Creature, <HI>Either
restore me my Husband</HI> Demetrius, <HI>or else take pity of
me, and let the same Swords that so barbarously mur∣thered
him send me also to the Grave.</HI> After the first
Transports were a little over, she ran in great Fury,
with a Dagger in her Hand, to the Quarters of the
<HI>Cosacks,</HI> and calling to those she knew by their Names;
<HI>Dear Friends,</HI> said she, <HI>either revenge the Murther of
my dear Lord, or at least do not refuse to do an Act
of Charity towards me; take here,</HI> cry'd she, <HI>this
Dagger, and with it deliver me from that Life,
which, since the fatal End of my Husband, cannot but
be loathsom and burthensom to me.</HI> The <HI>Cosacks,</HI> not
able to resist the Tears and Prayers of this charm∣ing
<PB N="114" REF="197"/>
Lady, fell with great Fury upon the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
whom they massacred wherever they met them in
the Streets, and very few would have escaped their
Fury, had they not at last been appeased by the
Perswasions of their Leader <HI>Zarucki.</HI></P>
<P>After the <HI>Cosacks</HI> had sacrificed several Hundreds
of the <HI>Tartars</HI> to the <HI>Manes</HI> of <HI>Demetrius</HI> and the
just Resentment of <HI>Marina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A third <HI>Deme∣trius.</HI></NOTE> those of <HI>Caluga</HI> chose
and proclaimed the Son of <HI>Demetrius</HI> and <HI>Marina,</HI>
Emperour of <HI>Russia;</HI> and tho' it is most generally
believed that <HI>Marina</HI> was barren, and this preten∣ded
Son a supposititious Child, yet <HI>Zarucki</HI> the Ge∣neral
of the <HI>Cosacks</HI> being willing to carry on the
Imposture in Opposition to the <HI>Polish</HI> Interest, ad∣dress'd
himself to the <HI>Russians,</HI> offering them his
Aid with all his Forces, if they would engage to
aknowledge, after the Example of <HI>Caluga,</HI> this
Son of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> Great Duke and Emperour of
<HI>Russia,</HI> so soon as they should have chased the <HI>Roles</HI>
out of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zolkievitski</HI> in the mean time perceiving himself
slighted by King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> whom he found to
have taken quite contrary Measures to what had
been agreed on betwixt him and the <HI>Muscovites</HI> by
the King's Order, he left the Army under Pretence
of going to fetch Prince <HI>Vladislaus</HI> to <HI>Musco,</HI> and
taking his Way by <HI>Smolensko,</HI> to shew his Discon∣tent,
he only saluted the King, and, without any
further stay, retired into <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The Affairs of <HI>Russia</HI> having thus for a while
hung in Suspence, whilst the People were kept un∣der
by the apprehension of a double Danger, to
wit, from the <HI>Poles</HI> within the Gates of their Ca∣pital
City, and the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Forces at <HI>Caluga,</HI>
they began now to change Face, and to appear
with another Countenance.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> after the departure of the
<HI>Polish</HI> General, finding King <HI>Sigismund</HI> resolute in
not sending his Son <HI>Vladislaus</HI> into the Empire, and
in the Continuation of the Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> and
seeing that both the Captive <HI>Zuski</HI>'s and their Am∣bassadors
<PB N="115" REF="197"/>
were sent away Prisoners into <HI>Poland,</HI> and
that the King took upon him the supream and ab∣solute
Administration of Affairs, putting such Of∣ficers
into all Places of Trust, as he thought most
convenient for his Purpose, they began to conceive
great Jealousies; and being now by the Death of
<HI>Demetrius</HI> delivered from their Fear on that side,
prepared for an open Revolt, in order to prevent
their Empire from becoming a Province of <HI>Poland,</HI>
which they look'd upon to be the main Design of
King <HI>Sigismund.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst he therefore wasted himself at the Siege
of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> which he thought ignominious to a∣bandon
before it was reduced, and thereby let slip
the most favourable Opportunity in the World, of
Establishing his Affairs in that Empire, the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
had, by his Delays, sufficient Leisure given
them to reunite themselves and make Provisions
for their future Security.</P>
<P>The first that appeared in Arms, towards the be∣ginning
of the Spring in the Year 1611, was one
<HI>Lepanovits,</HI> a Man of a great and ancient Family in
<HI>Muscovy;</HI> he having a great Interest in the Coun∣try,
had made secret Levies, and appearing with a
Body near <HI>Peresla,</HI> invited and gained most of the
Boyars and Nobility of the neighbouring Provinces
into his Party; He also sent his Messengers into the
more remote Parts, to represent to his Countrymen
the Breach of Faith of the <HI>Poles;</HI> how they had
possessed themselves of their Capital City, broke
the Articles agreed on betwixt both Nations, by
continuing the Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> and not sending
their Prince <HI>Vladislaus</HI> into <HI>Muscovy;</HI> how that
they, not only kept the <HI>Zuski</HI>'s, but also their Am∣bassadors
Prisoners against the Laws of Nations,
and, in all other Respects, treated them not like
a free People, but as Slaves depending from the
Mercy of their Conquerours. He exhorted them
to shake off this Foreign Yoak, and by giving
timely Assistance to secure themselves and their Po∣sterity
against the Insolencies of their mortal Ene∣mies
the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="198"/>
This had the desired Effect; for the Country
flocked in from all Parts, so that another great Ar∣my
was raised near <HI>Nisi Novogorod,</HI> under the Com∣mand
of <HI>Prosowecki</HI> a Lord of a very eminent Rank
in <HI>Muscovy;</HI> and <HI>Zarucki</HI> joined his Forces with
them, under Condition, that so soon as they should
have cleared their Country from the <HI>Poles,</HI> they
should proclaim the Young <HI>Demetrius,</HI> their Great
Duke and Emperour, which they were very free to
promise, tho' they had not the least Intention to
perform it, as <HI>Zarucki</HI> found afterwards to his
Cost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles</HI> were not unadvertised of the Designs
of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> but the King's Forces before
<HI>Smolensko</HI> being scarce sufficient to carry on the
Siege against a strong Garrison, he could not spare
any to disperse these Levies, and the <HI>Poles</HI> within
the City of <HI>Musco</HI> had enough to do to maintain
their Posts, and keep that vast Multitude of Peo∣ple
in subjection; so that these Levies, from a
small Beginning being improved into a great Bulk,
the <HI>Polish</HI> Forces which were quartered up and down
in the Country, to keep it in Obedience, were so far
from being able to attack them, that they were
scarce sufficient to keep on the Defensive.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the City, being now encou∣raged
by these <HI>Muscovian</HI> Lords appearing in Arms,
thought it now time to throw off the Mask, and to
give the <HI>Poles</HI> very sensible Proofs of their Aversion
towards them. A Design therefore was laid among
them, upon a Signal given to assemble and massacre
all the <HI>Poles</HI> within the City.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Musco</HI> was at that time much big∣ger
than it ever was before or since, by Reason of
the vast Confluence of Strangers, who during these
intestine Commotions were retired thither out of all
the neighbouring Provinces for Sanctuary, so that
it was computed to comprehend in its Circuit above
a Hundred and fifty Thousand Houses. All this vast
Multitude of Inhabitants being enrag'd to the high∣est
Pitch against the <HI>Poles,</HI> were ready to lend a
<PB N="117" REF="198"/>
helping Hand to accomplish the Design of the Con∣spirators,
they only wanting a Head to lead them
on to put it in Execution.</P>
<P>A thing of this Nature could not be carried on
so privately, but that <HI>Gaziowski,</HI> who then com∣manded
the <HI>Poles</HI> in Chief, had timely Notice of
their projected Design, but thinking it not advisable
to be the first Aggressor, he dissembled his Notice,
and contented himself with fortifying the two
Quarters of the City called <HI>Catangorod</HI> or the Mid-City,
and <HI>Czargorod</HI> or the City-Royal, which be∣ing
surrounded with good Stone-Walls, and con∣taining
the Castle, with the Royal Palace, all the
Magazines, and great Houses of the Nobility and
Merchants, he proposed to himself as a safe Retreat
upon all Occasions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Polish</HI> General <HI>Gaziouski</HI> had scarce finished
his Works, before the <HI>Russians</HI> finding by the Pre∣cautions
used by the <HI>Poles,</HI> that their Design had
taken vent, resolved to put it in Execution, trust∣ing
more in their Number than their Conduct, and
having on the third day after <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> drawn
together an incredible Number of People by the
Ringing of the Bells, they attack'd the <HI>Poles,</HI> with
a Fury past all Belief, as Men resolv'd either
to accomplish their Design, or to die in the At∣tempt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poles</HI> attacked in the City of <HI>Musco.</HI></NOTE> on the other Hand, being surrounded
and attack'd on all sides, animated by Despair, and
having the Advantage of a well regulated Disci∣pline
against a confused Multitude, repulsed their
Enemies with great Vigour, who, tho▪ most obstinate
and furious in their reiterated Assaults, were never∣theless
at last forced to give way to the Bravery of
the <HI>Poles,</HI> who made them retreat with the Loss of
near Ten thousand Men on their side. No sooner
had the <HI>Poles</HI> removed them from their Works, but
they sallied out with some thousand Men, and ha∣ving
prosecuted their Victo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and slain a great
Number of them at a great distance from their
Quarters, they see all the circumjacent Parts of the
<PB N="118" REF="199"/>
City on fire, which destroyed not only a prodi∣gious
Number of Houses, but also of Women,
Children and other helpless Persons. The next day
the <HI>Polish</HI> General, having received Intelligence
that most of the Inhabitants of <HI>Musco</HI> were retired
to the Suburbs called <HI>Strelitza Slavoda,</HI> which lies
South of <HI>Cataygorod</HI> or the Mid-City, on the oppo∣site
Shore of the River <HI>Moska,</HI> where they were dispu∣ting
the Passage to <HI>Strusius,</HI> who, with a good Bo∣dy,
was come from <HI>Malsaisko,</HI> upon the first News
of the Tumult, to the Relief of his Countrymen,
he made a strong Sally, and having caused the said
Suburbs to be set on fire in several parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Musco</HI> burnt by the <HI>Poles▪</HI></NOTE> he burnt
it quite to the Ground, thereby facilitating the Pas∣sage
of the <HI>Poles</HI> who came to his Assistance and se∣curing
to himself a free Communication, which
stood him in great stead afterwards upon several
Occasions.</P>
<P>It is computed that a Hundred and twenty
Thousand Houses were laid in Ashes by that ra∣ging
Element, and that by the Fire and Sword
there fell near Two hundred Thousand of the In∣habitants
of all Sorts, besides an incredible Quantity
of Stores and Merchandices.</P>
<P>The Remainders of the Inhabitants seeing their
City thus laid in Ashes, and themselves sufficiently
tamed by the Sword, implored the Mercy of the
conquering <HI>Poles,</HI> rejecting (as it is usual in such
Cases) the Fault upon a few of their Ringleaders,
who had paid for it with their Lives. The <HI>Poles</HI>
knowing themselves not in a Capacity to do any fur∣ther
Mischief, and being glad to have reduced them
to ask Quarter, granted it without Difficulty. But
as it was owing to the utmost necessity of their Af∣fairs,
so this Truce so earnestly sued for by the <HI>Mus∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovites,</HI>
lasted not long. For the Inhabitants of <HI>Musco</HI>
having invited <HI>Lepanovits, Prosowecki, Zarucki,</HI> and
the rest of the Leaders of the Army, we men∣tioned
before, to come to their Assistance, they ad∣vanced
with a Hundred thousand Men towards the
City, upon whose Approach having joined with
<PB N="119" REF="199"/>
their Forces, they forced the <HI>Poles</HI> into their Works
where they were so closely besieg'd, that they had
but one Passage left open for their Communication
with the Country, which was that part on the other
side of the River <HI>Moska,</HI> where not long before
had stood the Suburbs called <HI>Strelitza Slavoda,</HI> and
which they kept open a long time for the Conve∣niency
of their Provisions and other Supplies, and
made frequent Sallies with great Success on their
side, till at last by the ill Conduct of King <HI>Sigis∣mund,</HI>
they were forced to abandon that Post, and
soon after, the whole City, to the irreparable de∣triment
of the said King.</P>
<P>For whilst the brave <HI>Poles</HI> were hardly pressed
upon by their Enemies, he lay immovable at the
Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> where his Affairs began to look
with a very ill Face. For the Soldiers, tired with
the long Continuance of the Siege, grew very un∣easie
for want of Pay, and their Clamours were
now risen to that height, that the King began to
dread every day a Mutiny, having not wherewithal
to satisfie their just Demands, nor any other Means
now left to raise Money, unless by calling together
a Dyet, which at last was resolved on, and a Con∣vention
of the Estates appointed against the <HI>Sep∣tember</HI>
next following; This Remedy, tho' some∣what
slow, to satisfie the greedy Appetite of the
Soldiers, yet were they (in Hopes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a happy Suc∣cess
of that Assembly) thereby appeased for that
time.</P>
<P>The King, in the mean time, considering with
himself, that the Measures he had taken in <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
contrary to the Advice of the Senate and his Coun∣cil,
having proved abortive, would not be very a∣greeable
to the Convention, he resolved to make a∣nother
Attempt for the Gaining of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> not
questioning but, that, if he could appear at the
next Dyet as a Conquerour, it would in a great
measure take off the Blemish of his former Con∣duct
in the <HI>Muscovian</HI> War. A general Assault
being therefore resolved on to be made on the <HI>13th.</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="200"/>
day of <HI>June;</HI> the Soldiers encouraged by the Hopes
of the Booty of so vast and rich a City, shewed a
great Eagerness to attack the Place.</P>
<P>The Assault was made on the East side, by the
Palatine of <HI>Braclow,</HI> and on the West, where then
was the King's Quarters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smolen∣sko <HI>stor∣med▪</HI></NOTE> by General <HI>Wyer,</HI> who
commanded the <HI>Germans.</HI> The Soldiers had found
means before break of day to raise Ladders in seve∣ral
places upon the Walls, unperceived by the Ene∣my;
so that, at the Signal given, the <HI>Germans</HI> first
mounted and got up to the Top of the Walls, as
did also, not long after, the <HI>Poles,</HI> under the Com∣mand
of the Palatine, without much Opposition
from the Enemy, who being thus attack'd upon a
sudden, when they least expected it, those Forces
that were left for the Guard of the Walls were not
sufficient to stop the furious Assault of the <HI>Poles.</HI>
But the Descent from the Wall into the City being
very steep, and the whole Garrison having by this
time taken the Alarm, came flocking in great Num∣bers
to the defence of their Walls, the Combat
grew very hot, the <HI>Poles</HI> pushing forward with
great Bravery to maintain the Advantage they had
got, and the Garrison armed with Despair fighting
like Men either resolved to vanquish or die; so that
the Dispute remained very doubtful, and perhaps
would have ended to the Disadvantage of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
if the same <HI>Novodorski,</HI> whom we mentioned before
to have so bravely attacked the Gate of S. <HI>Michael,</HI>
had not come to their Assistance.</P>
<P>For, he having, whilst they were engaged upon the
Walls, found means to apply a Petard at a certain
small Gate on the side of the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> he open'd a
sufficient Passage for him and the King's Guards which
were under his Command: In the Head of whom he,
being seconded by the Marshal of <HI>Lithuania, Doro∣stanski,</HI>
with some Volunteers, assaulted and entred
the Place, and having slain a few who opposed
their Entrance, they marched without any further
Opposition directly to the Market-place, where
having fix'd their Banners, they soon made them∣selves
<PB N="121" REF="200"/>
Masters of the whole City. For the Garrison
who were engaged with those upon the Walls, see∣ing
the Enemy in the Heart of their City, and in∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuated
with Fear occasioned by the Suddenness of
the Adventure, threw down their Arms, quitted
their Stations, and left a free Passage for the Besie∣gers
to enter in on all sides upon them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smolen∣sko</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken by Storm.</NOTE> In a Mo∣ment
there was nothing but Horrour and Confusion
to be seen throughout the City. For the <HI>Poles,</HI> en∣raged
at the long Resistance of the Besieged, put all
they met to the Sword, Men, Women and Chil∣dren,
without distinction of Age or Sex, so that
the Streets were every where fill'd with Blood and
Slaughter.</P>
<P>A great Number of the Citizens run with their
Wives and Children, who made most horrible out∣cries,
to the great Church, where being assaulted
by the <HI>Poles</HI> they defended themselves valiantly for
some time, but being at last overcome, they set
fire to some Barrels of Powder that had been laid
up there, and thus blew themselves, with such
of the <HI>Poles</HI> as were entred, into the Air, chusing
rather to perish by this furious Element, than
the Hands of their bloody and merciless Ene∣mies▪</P>
<P><HI>Sehin</HI> the Weywode or Governour was retired
with about twenty of the principal Officers into a
little Tower upon the Wall, where being surroun∣ded
and attacked on all sides by the <HI>Poles,</HI> they de∣fended
themselves like Lyons, declaring that they
would not surrender unless to one of the General
Officers of the Army. The Governour had used
some of the <HI>Polish</HI> Prisoners very cruelly, so that
dreading the Vengeance of the <HI>Poles,</HI> if he should
fall into their Hands, he was resolved rather to die,
than surrender to their Mercy. It happned very luc∣kily,
that <HI>Potocki</HI> a General Officer among the <HI>Poles,</HI>
advanced near that Way, who having enquired in∣to
the Cause of this Resistance made by a few Men,
Word was brought him, that it was the Governo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of the Place, who refused to surrender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to
<PB N="122" REF="201"/>
one of the principal Officers; upon which he came
to the Place where <HI>Sehin</HI> with his Comrades yielded
themselves immediately Prisoners of War.</P>
<P>Thus was this great City, after having endured
a Siege of near two Years, taken in a few Hours,
in <HI>June,</HI> in the Year 1611. The Honour of which
ought chiefly to be ascribed to the Bravery and
Conduct of <HI>Bartholomew Novodorski,</HI> Knight of
<HI>Maltha,</HI> and Captain of the King's Guards; who
by his timely opening a Passage with his Petard
was the main Instrument of the Gaining of the
Place; without which that Attempt of Sealing the
Walls would in all likelihood have prov'd unsuccess∣ful,
or at least would not have been effected with∣out
the Slaughter of a great many of the Besiegers;
whereas it was now purchased with the Loss of a
few among the <HI>Poles.</HI> The Place being thus secu∣red,
strict Orders were sent throughout all the
Quarters of the City, to give Quarter, and that the
King had given the Pillage of the City to the Sol∣diers,
as the Reward of their past Fatigues and
Dangers. But the Soldiers, especially the <HI>Germans</HI>
and <HI>Poles,</HI> not agreeing about the distribution of it,
were upon the point of coming to Blows, when
the King ordered all the Booty to be brought, into
one place in order to make an equal Dividend a∣mong
them. But whilst they were busie in exe∣cuting
the King's Command, a Fire hapning, by
what Accident is unknown, consuming in a little
time all the vast Wealth of that rich City, and burnt
a great part of it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding a Siege sustained of near two
Years, there was found in the Magazines Provisions
and Ammunition for three Years longer; so that
if they could have had fresh Supplies of Men,
the Place might have been defended much longer,
the Garrison and Inhabitants which at the beginning
of the Siege consisted of near fourscore, thousand
Men, able to bear Arms, being reduced to eight or
nine thousand, who nevertheless might probably
have made good the Place against the assailants up∣on
<PB N="123" REF="201"/>
the Wall, if they had not been more conquered
by their own Fears occasioned by the sudden En∣trance
of <HI>Novodorski,</HI> than by the Power of their
Enemies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> being under a great Consterna∣tion
after the taking of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> who expecting
no less than to see the whole <HI>Polish</HI> Army in a little
time at the Gates of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> redoubled
their Fury, attacking the <HI>Polish</HI> Garrison in the Ca∣stle
with their utmost Vigour, but these being en∣couraged
by the Success of their King, disputed e∣very
Inch of Ground with the Enemy, who, not∣withstanding
their vast Number, were not able to
drive them from that Post by which they kept
a Communication with the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Sigismund,</HI> on the other Hand, was advised by his
most able Counsellours, not to lose the Fruits of his
Victory, but to improve it to the utmost, by carrying
the Terrour of his victorious Arms to the Gates of
the Capital City, where having a considerable Par∣ty,
even among the <HI>Russians</HI> themselves, the Repu∣tation
of his late Success could not fail to produce
strange Effects among the <HI>Muscovites</HI> to his Advan∣tage;
That if he would but march to the Relief of
his Subjects, who there disputed his Interest with
all the Bravery imaginable, it was very p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obable he
might keep in Possession of that great City, which
if once in his Power, the rest of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovinces of
that Empire would be soon compelled to receive
his Dictates, especially if they saw <HI>Vladislaus</HI> their
Great Duke appear in <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>But King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> as if overswayed by some
secret Fatality, was so far from hearkning to their
Counsels founded upon most solid Reasons of
State, that he took quite contrary Measures, and
in lieu of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osecuting his Victory, resolved to turn
his Back to his new Acquisitions, and to exchange
the fair Hopes of Gaining a vast Empi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, with the
vain Acclamations of his People in <HI>Poland,</HI> and
the empty Noise of Triumph, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st him no
less than the Loss of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is

ill Conduct had lost him some Years before his He∣reditary
Kingdom of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>Having therefore feasted the whole Army for three
days (to make in some measure an At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onement for
the Loss of their Booty) and left a Body of T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oops,
under the Command of <HI>Charles Chodkievitski,</HI> for the
Guard of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> he himself returned into <HI>Po∣land</HI>
to receive the Flatteries of his Subjects.</P>
<P>At the next Meeting of the Diet of that King∣dom,
he was received with all the Pomp and Cere∣monies
due to a Conquerour: The Estates were
not sparing in their Addresses and Congratulations,
many Speeches were made in the Assembly in Praise
of the King who had added so great a Province
to the Commonwealth, made himself Master of
the Imperial City of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire, and
got their Great Duke <HI>Zuski</HI> in his Custody.</P>
<P><HI>Sigismund</HI> himself was so intoxicated with these
imaginary Honours, that he caused <HI>Zolkievitzki,</HI>
who first took Possession of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> to
make his solemn Entry in Triumph, being attended
by a most numerous and magnificent Cavalcade,
and followed by the Great Duke <HI>Basili Zuski,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Basili Zus∣ki</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in Triumph.</NOTE> who
with his two Brothers, was seated in an open Cha∣riot,
and thus like Captives led to the Senate-House,
where being admited, <HI>Zolkievitzki</HI> present∣ed
these Captive Princes to the King and Assembly,
and having in a very lofty Harangue extolled the
Fortune of the Commonwealth of <HI>Poland,</HI> in ha∣ving
got these Illustrious Persons into their Posses∣sion,
by whose Misfortune they had opened them∣selves
the Way into the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, and to the
Throne it self by the Election of Prince <HI>Vladislans</HI>
Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> He did not want Vanity
to compare the Captivity of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ese Princes to the
greatest Exploits of the most renowned Heroes of
A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiquity; tho' it was sufficiently known that they
were fain into his Hands, more by the Treachery
of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> than the Bravery of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
who, whilst they trif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed away their time in Com∣plementing
and Flattering th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves, let slip the

best and most favourable Opportunity in the World,
to make themselves real Masters of that Empire
which they had swallowed up in their imaginary
Panegyricks. <HI>Zuski</HI> and his two Brothers were by
the King's Order sent Prisoners to <HI>Goston</HI> Castle,
where they were treated according to their Quality.</P>
<P>But <HI>Basili Zuski</HI> did not long survive the Loss of
his Empire and Liberty, the Weight of his Sor∣rows
having, as it is believed, deprived him of his
Life soon after; He was some time after followed
by one of his Brothers, who also died for Grief;
They were both privately buried betwixt <HI>Warsaw</HI>
and <HI>Thorn,</HI> where their Ashes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested till the End of
the War betwixt these two Crowns, when they
were translated into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and interred among
their A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cestors.</P>
<P>This <HI>Basili Zuski,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dies in <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> ended
his Life in Captivity, in a Foreign Country, after a
short and troublesome Reign. He was a Person of
a more than ordinary Capacity and Merit, which
had raised him to the highest Station in the Empire,
before he mounted the Throne; which as he ob∣tained
by Fraud and Blood, so he endeavoured
to settle it by the same Arts, by which he had
gained it. And knowing the, <HI>Muscovites</HI> to be a
People the most unstable in the World, and soon
hurried from one Extream to another, he had at
last, (when he found his Affairs in a declining Con∣dition)
Recourse to Witchcraft and other violent
Means, which served him for no other End than
to hasten his Ruin, and to remove him from the
Throne to a Prison where he ended his Days. A
remarkable Instance of the perpetual Vicissitudes
of Human Greatness, and the Instability of Popu∣lar
Favour.</P>
<P>But it is time to return to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI>
and to see what different Effects this Retreat of
<HI>Sigismund</HI> out of <HI>Muscovy</HI> produced among the
<HI>Russians</HI> and the <HI>Polish</HI> Garrison.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="203"/>
The <HI>Muscovites</HI> being, by the Departure of the
King, delivered from what they dreaded most, to
wit, his Marching to the Relief of the <HI>Polish</HI> Gar∣rison
in <HI>Musco,</HI> re-assumed new Vigour, and, by
their repeated Attacks, press'd so hard upon the
<HI>Poles,</HI> that they shut them up close within their
Fortifications; and these, seeing themselves thus
neglected by their Prince, and expos'd to Danger
without any prospect of Relief, began to contrive
Means for their own Safety, a great many among
them, under pretence of want of Pay, openly de∣manding
their Dismission.</P>
<P><HI>Gaziowski</HI> their General did endeavour by all
means possible to keep them in Obedience, flatter∣ing
them with Hopes of a speedy Relief, and per∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving
that his Words had not the desired Effect,
he contriv'd Counterfeit Letters to be brought to
him as coming from the King, out of <HI>Poland,</HI> fill'd
with Promises of a most powerful Relief in a
very short time. To take away all the Pretence
from the Soldiers of demanding their Dismission for
want of Pay, he caused a Statue of our Saviour's of
massie Gold, valued at near fifty thousand Pounds,
which stood with the Twelve Apostles in the Great
Church of the Castle (the latter being melted down
by the Order of <HI>Basili Zuski,</HI> as was mention'd before)
to be divided among the Soldiery, who quickly sacri∣ficed,
the same Statue to their Avarice, which they
had adored but a few days before. The General
having by this and some other Dividends taken out
of the Treasury of the Great Dukes of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
(which was in his Possession) appeased and encou∣raged
his disheartned Soldiers, he kept them in
continual Exercise by frequent Sallies, from
whence they seldom return'd without Advantage,
they were much flush'd with this Success against
the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Magazine of Salt without the Forti∣fications
of the <HI>Poles,</HI> which had been spared by
the Flames, when the <HI>Poles</HI> set the City on fire.
The Besiegers and the Besieged standing equally in
<PB N="127" REF="203"/>
need of this Commodity, as having, no other to
supply their present Occasions, this gave them con∣stant
Employment on both sides.</P>
<P>This Magazine was at so near a distance from
the <HI>Poles,</HI> that it would have been no difficult
Matter for them to inclose it within their Lines,
but their General knowing that their own and the
Enemies Wants would engage them in continual
Skirmishes, did not think convenient to take
away this Opportunity of keeping his Men in A∣ction.</P>
<P>He made it also his Business to sow the Seeds
of Discord among the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Cosacks</HI> that
served in the <HI>Russian</HI> Army, from whence he hoped
to reap no small Benefit, if he could bring over the
<HI>Cosacks</HI> to his Party, and at the same time contrive
the Destruction of <HI>Lepanowitz</HI> the <HI>Russian</HI> General.
For which purpose he caused several counterfeit
Letters to be dispersed in the Provinces written in
<HI>Lepanowitz</HI>'s Name, wherein he commanded the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> to fall upon the perfidious <HI>Cosacks</HI> in
their Quarters, having received certain Intelligence,
that they intended to side with the Young <HI>Deme∣trius</HI>
at <HI>Caluga.</HI> The General's Name of the <HI>Du∣nensian
Cosacks</HI> that served at that time in the <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
Army, was <HI>Sidorus,</HI> who formerly had
been in the Interest of this Young <HI>Demetrius</HI> his
Father. <HI>Gaziowski</HI> was very careful to cause one
of these Letters to fall into his Hands, who not in
the least suspecting any Fraud in the Matter, with∣out
any further Consultation communicated it to
the other principal Officers of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> repre∣senting
to them their common Danger, in Terms
so lively and natural, as sufficiently testified his Ap∣prehension
of their imaginary Peril; Being all ter∣rified
with the imminent Danger of their approach∣ing
Ruin and Destruction, they unanimously resol∣ved
to anticipate their Fate and return it upon their
Enemies; for which Reason having communicated
their Design to the Soldiers, they ran all to their
Arms, fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing upon the <HI>Muscovites</HI> next to their
Quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="204"/>
<HI>Lepanowitz,</HI> surpriz'd at the Suddenness of the
Matter, and being not in the least forewarned of the
Trap laid against his Life, hastned thither with a
few of his Friends to appease the Tumult by his
Authority, or else to give the necessary Orders for
stopping tho Violences of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> who no soo∣ner
saw him appear, but looking upon him as the
chief Author of their imaginary Massacre, and be∣ing
under-hand edged on to his Destruction by cer∣tain
Emissaries sent among them for that purpose
by the <HI>Polish</HI> General, they soon overpowered and
slew him upon the place.</P>
<P>By this time the rest of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Generals,
having got what Forces they could together, mar∣ched
at the Head of them to the Quarters
of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> who were also on their side pre∣paring
for a resolute Defence, and, if all Means
fail'd, to open their Passage to the Castle, in or∣der
to join with the <HI>Poles;</HI> so that the projected De∣sign
of <HI>Gaziowski,</HI> was upon the very point of ha∣ving
had its desired Effect, if <HI>Trubecowitz.</HI> (who
upon the News of the Fall of <HI>Lepanowitz,</HI> was de∣clared
General over the <HI>Muscovites</HI>) seeing them
so resolute in their Defence, had not desired a Par∣ly
with some of their principal Officers, which ha∣ving
been granted, and he being informed of the
false Apprehensions of their imminent Danger,
which had occasioned this Mutiny gave them such
convincing Demonstrations of the Falsity of their
imaginary Peril, and the most sincere Assurances of
his Protection and Acknowledgment of their Ser∣vices,
that the Tumult was appealed without any
further Bloodshed.</P>
<P>Neither was it long before the Artifices of <HI>Ga∣ziowski</HI>
were discovered and quite eluded by the
Care of the new <HI>Muscovite</HI> General, who having
caused some of the <HI>Polish</HI> Emissaries (who were
sent into the Camp to debauch the <HI>Cosacks)</HI> to be
seized and tortured, they confessed the whole
Matter, and were put to death with the most
exquisite Torments in View of their Countrymen
<PB N="129" REF="204"/>
within the Castle, to deterr them f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the attemp∣ting
any thing like it for the Future.</P>
<P>There having by this means an entire Reconcilia∣tion
and good Correspondence been re-establ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed
betwixt the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Gosacks,</HI> they with their
joint Forces vigorously p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osecuted the Siege, and
pressed so hard upon the <HI>Poles</HI> on all sides, that they
drove them out of all their Out-works, and at last
possess'd themselves also of those Fortifications
which they had on the other side of the River <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣ca,</HI>
for the maintaining a Communication and Cor∣respondency
with the Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, whereby being
put out of all Hopes of Relief, and of receiving
the Necessary Supplies of Provisions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey were re∣duced
to great Wants. Having been forced to en∣dure
great Hardships for want of all manner of
Necessaries for the Space of several Weeks, and e∣very
thing seeming to tend to a general Insurre∣ction
among the <HI>Polish</HI> Soldiers, they were on the
fifteenth day of <HI>August</HI> unexpectedly delivered by a
lucky Accident, or rather a Miracle.</P>
<P>It is to be observed that the <HI>Poles</HI> before they
were so closely pent up by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
when they were as yet Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters of the Pass oppo∣site
to the Mid-City on the other side of the River
<HI>Mosca,</HI> had sent several strong Parties abroad, part∣ly,
the better to husband that small Store of Pro∣visions
which were remaining in the Castle, partly
to get what Booty they could in the Country, to
supply their Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts within. Being especially redu∣ced
to great Straights for want of Forage, they had
sent all their Boys and Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nts out a foraging,
which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> having got notice of, they took
this Opportunity to attack in the mean while this
Post with the utmost Vigour, which, after a brave
Resistance, they made themselves Masters of, and
having caused a Line to be made, with the necessa∣ry
Redoubts on all the Avenues, guarded by a
considerable Body of their best Troops, they
thought to have now cut off all Hopes of Relief
or receiving Supplies from the Besieged; as in

effect they had, if their own Fears had not once
more opened that Passage to the Enemy.</P>
<P>For scarce were these Lines perfected, when the
several Parties sent abroad by the <HI>Poles,</HI> which all
together amounted to some Thousands, being at a
certain place, according to Agreement joined in
one Body and met by the Forage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s who were march∣ing
to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> in order to their return
into the Castle; but approaching the River <HI>Mosca,</HI>
found all the Avenues leading to it, secured by the
Enemy's Lines. They were at first at a stand▪ not
knowing what to resolve upon in this present Exi∣gency
of their Affairs, most of the Soldiers that
were among them tired before with the Fatigues
and Hardships they had endured, being for retiring
and shifting for themselves; But the Boys and o∣ther
Servants that had been foraging, declaring
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they would not abandon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Masters without
attempting their Relief; the rest being at last over∣come
with Shame, resolved also to open their Pas∣sage
with their Swords, and force their Way into
the Castle. Pursuant to this Resolution they put
their little Army in Battle-Array, and extending
their Front (where they had placed all the Soldiers)
as much as possibly they could, they advanced with
Colours flying, Drums beating, and Trumpets
sounding, in good Order, towards the Enemy's
Lines. Scarce were they come within sight of the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> but these imagining no less than that
the whole <HI>Polish</HI> Army was advancing to the Re∣lief
of their Countrymen, and being seiz'd by a
Panick Fear, without any further delay quitted
their Lines, and retired on the other side of the
River <HI>Mosca,</HI> leaving a free Passage to the <HI>Poles,</HI>
who entred <HI>Cataygorod,</HI> or the Mid-City (which
comprehends the Castle within its Walls) without
the least Opposition, where they were received
with all the Demonstra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of Joy and Praises
due to their Courage.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="205"/>
<HI>Gaziowski</HI> the <HI>Polish</HI> Gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al having, out of what
had hapned, and the Confusion he observed among
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> in the City, soon guess'd at the true
Reason of their sudden Retreat, and willing to
improve so favourable an Opportunity, caused a
strong Sally to be made upon the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who
being scared with the. Apprehensions of the Ap∣proach
of the whole Force of <HI>Poland,</HI> durst not
look the Enemy in the Face; so that the <HI>Poles</HI> re∣covered
in a few Hours from the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> what
had cost them many Months before they could
gain it; and during this Consternation it would
have been no difficult Matter to have chased them
quite out of the City, if he that comman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the
Sally would have pushed on his Advantage with the
same Vigour to the last, as he did in the Beginning.
But this Commander being at Variance with <HI>Ga∣ziowski</HI>
the <HI>Polish</HI> General, but intimate Friend of
<HI>Chodkienitski</HI> Lieutenant-General of the <HI>Lith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nian</HI>
Army, who was design'd for the Relief of the Ca∣stle
of <HI>Musco,</HI> he was afraid, that if he should
prosecute the Victory to the utmost, he should rob
his Friend, to whom he was obliged for his Ad∣vancement,
of the Honour of having delivered the
City of <HI>Musco</HI> into the Hands of King <HI>Sigismund;</HI> so
that being contented with having enlarged the <HI>Po∣lish</HI>
Quarters, and chased the <HI>Muscovites</HI> out of their
Posts, he returned without pursui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Enemy,
having let slip a fair Opportunity of securing this
Imperial City, and consequently the whole Empire
for King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> both which were not long af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
lost by the King's ill Conduct, and the Jealousies
which reigned among his Generals, as we shall have
Occasion to relate anon. For, tho' the <HI>Poles</HI>
flush'd with this Success, reassumed new Courage for
a little time, yet finding the Enemy, after his first
Consternation was▪ over, to attack them afresh
with more Vigour than ever, and by degrees to
drive them out of their most advanced Posts, and that
they had but little Hopes of any solid Supply out
of <HI>Poland,</HI> which might be sufficient to divert the
<PB N="132" REF="206"/>
whole Force of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> they in a mutinous Man∣ner
demanded their Pay, declaring that they would
no longer expose themselves to such Hazards, with∣out
the least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opes of Relief or Reward. <HI>Gaziowski</HI>
endeavouring by all means possible to appease the
Tumult, (which was fomented by the Divisions a∣mong
the Chief Officers) it was agreed that Letters
should be once more dispatched into <HI>Poland</HI> by a
trusty Messenger, after whose Return they should
be at Liberty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o dispose of themselves as they found
it most convenient to the present Circumstances of
their Affairs.</P>
<P>Accordingly a Letter was sent to King <HI>Sigismund,</HI>
written in the Name of the <HI>Polish</HI> Garrison of the
Castle of <HI>Musco;</HI> wherein having represented to
the King, how faithfully they had served him in
their Station, how they had held out for a conside∣rable
time against the whole Force of <HI>Muscovy,</HI>
struggled with Famine and all other Inconvenien∣cies,
which must be the necessary Consequences of
so long a Siege, they found themselves and their
Services neglected, by not receiving any Supplies of
Men or Money, that their Condition was such as
not to be able to defend themselves much longer a∣gainst
so numerous an Army; if not powerfully as∣sisted
by the King; That therefore they were obliged
to consult their own Safety; and to declare, that if
by the sixth of <HI>January</HI> next ensuing, their Prince
<HI>Vladislaus</HI> were not sent to their Assistance with a
considerable Body of Troops, and all other things
requisite to enable him to maintain his just Claim
(by Virtue of the last Election) to the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Crown, they were unanimously resolv'd to quit the
Castle, to march back into <HI>Poland,</HI> and to require
their Arrears.</P>
<P>King <HI>Sigismund</HI> being not a little startled at the
peremptory Demands of the Soldiery in <HI>Musco,</HI>
was uncertain what Measures to take, to maintain
his Interest in the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire; but remaining
stedfast in his Resolution not to send his Son <HI>Vla∣dislaus,</HI>
he order'd <HI>Charles Chodkievitski,</HI> Lieutenant-General
<PB N="133" REF="206"/>
of the <HI>Lithuanian</HI> Army, to march with
some Thousands of his best Troops towards the
City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and to maintain the Castle against
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> till he having settled his Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s at
Home, should be at leisure to march the next
Spring to their Assistance with a Royal Army.</P>
<P><HI>Potocki,</HI> Palatine of <HI>Braclovia,</HI> was at that time
Commander in Chief over those Forces that were left
for the Guard of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Province and City of <HI>Smolen∣sko,</HI>
who had signaliz'd himself upon several Occa∣sions
at the Siege of that Place, and being an inti∣mate
Friend of <HI>Gaziowski</HI> the <HI>Polish</HI> General within
the Castle of <HI>Musco,</HI> look'd with a very ill Eye up∣on
this Advancement of <HI>Chodkievitski,</HI> which he
thought to have been due to himself, or at least to
his Friend <HI>Gaziowski;</HI> and therefore resolved to
thwart all his Designs. For which purpose it was
insinuated into the Chief Officers, That <HI>Chodkie∣vitski</HI>
was sent with an Army out of <HI>Poland</HI> to pro∣secute
the <HI>Muscovian</HI> War, and to take Possession of
the Imperial City, to the gaining of which he had
contributed little or nothing, to defraud them of
the Honour and Rewards of their past Labours;
The common Souldiers being also terrified with his
Severity in Martial Discipline, by the Artifices of
<HI>Potocki</HI>'s Emissaries, were prepossess'd with such an
Aversion against his Person, that at his Arrival they
refused to obey his Commands, neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould they be
prevailed upon to make any more Sallies, which the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> improving to their Advantage, straight∣ned
them more and more without any considerable
Opposition.</P>
<P>The time was thus trifled away in Contests with∣in
the Castle till the sixth of <HI>January,</HI> the Day pre∣fix'd
for the Departure of the Garrison, in their
Letter to King <HI>Sigismund,</HI> if Prince <HI>Vladislaus</HI> did
not come to their Relief; when they unanimously
declar'd, That they would march directly into <HI>Po∣land</HI>
to get Satisfaction for their Arrears.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="207"/>
<HI>Chodkievitski,</HI> with all the Head Officers of his
Party, did omit nothing which they believ'd might
keep them in Obedience; they endeav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ured by
Entreaties, Promises and Threats, to induce them
to alter, or at least to deferr their Resolution, but
in vain; For having chosen one <HI>Joseph Cieclinski</HI>
their General, they march'd, to the Number of be∣twixt
seven and eight thousand Men, most Horse,
out of the Castle, and having opened their Passage
with their Swords thorow their Enemies, directed
their March to the Lesser <HI>Poland,</HI> where having di∣stributed
their Troops into several Palatinates,
they made <HI>Leopolis</HI> their Head Quarters, and seiz'd
not only upon the King's Domains, but also upon
the Ecclesiastical Revenues for the Satisfaction of
their Arrears. There was however a Body of
four thousand Men, to wit, that commanded by
<HI>Sapiha,</HI> left for the Guard of the Castle of <HI>Musco,</HI>
who were at last prevail'd upon to stay for some
time longer, by the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ospect of great Advantages,
having all the Crown-Jewels of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> consist∣ing
of two Crowns of Gold beset with Gems,
two Sceptres with Diamonds, two Ducal Bonnets,
the Golden Apple, and other precious Stones of
great Value, put into their Hands as a Pledge for
their Pay.</P>
<P><HI>Potocki</HI> having thus far succeeded in his Design,
and finding things reduc'd to Extremity by his
Contrivances, he thought it now fit time to step in
for the Prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vation of the Place; for which pur∣pose
he sent a considerable Force from <HI>Smolensko,</HI>
under the Command of <HI>Konickpotski</HI> a Creature of
his own, and not long after, his near Kinsman
<HI>Nicholas Strusius,</HI> with part of the Garrison of <HI>Smo∣lensko,</HI>
to the Assistance of those within the Castle
of <HI>Musco.</HI> They entred without the least Oppo∣sition,
thro' that Pass which the <HI>Poles</HI> had as yet
maintain'd on the other side of the River <HI>Mosca;</HI>
and those within being reinforc'd and encourag'd
by so considerable a Number of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oops,
might without all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not only have maintain'd
<PB N="135" REF="207"/>
but also have enlarg'd their Quarters, if the Jea∣lousie
and Envy that reign'd among the Officers had
not rendred all the Designs of <HI>Chodkicvitski</HI> fruitless;
so that, notwithstanding the considerable Accession
of these Troops, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> found Means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
pen them up closer every day, and at last to cut of
their Communication with the Country, by perfect∣ing
their Lines on the other side of the River <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sca.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sapihan</HI> Horse, consisting of four thousand
Men, seeing themselves in danger of being en∣closed
without any Hopes of Relief, and unwilling
to lose the Treasure they had got so lately in their
possession, declared unanimously, that they were
resolved not to endure any longer the Dangers and
Fatigues of a close Siege, without the least Prospect of
Success on their side; and that they would follow the
Example of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he rest, who were some months before
marched into <HI>Poland.</HI> Accordingly having chosen
one <HI>John Zalinski</HI> their Commander in Chief, they
march'd out with all the Crown-Jewels in their
Possession, and having with great Bravery fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced
the Enemy's Lines, march'd directly into <HI>Lithuania,</HI>
setting up their Head Quarters at <HI>Bresla,</HI> and trea∣ding
the Footsteps of their Brethren in the Lesser
<HI>Poland,</HI> took up their Quarters in the neighbouring
Palatinates, where they liv'd at discretion upon the
King's Domains and the Ecclesiastical Revenues,
till their Arrears were paid.</P>
<P>King <HI>Sigismund</HI> was by this time become sensible
of his fatal Error in not sending his Son <HI>Vladislaus</HI>
into <HI>Muscovy;</HI> especially when the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility
exasperated by the Insolencies of the confederate
Forces in the Lesser <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> began to
break out into open Complaints, charging the
King with the Causes of all these Disorde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which
might have been prevented if he had not preferr'd
the Insinuations of his flattering Courtiers before
the wholesom Advice of his Senate and his most ex∣perienced
Officers. To repa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r therefore, if possible,
his former Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake, he resolved to bring <HI>Vladislaus</HI>
thither in Person at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad of a good Army, and
<PB N="136" REF="208"/>
having assembled what Forces he had in Readiness,
march'd directly to <HI>Vilna</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Li∣thuania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mund</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rches to the Relief of <HI>Musco.</HI></NOTE>
expecting to be join'd there by the Confe∣derate
Forces, by reason of their great Zeal for the
Interest of their Prince <HI>Vladislaus.</HI> But these ha∣ving
once tasted the Sweets of their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiful
Quarters, and having yet in fresh Remembrance
their late Fatigues sustain'd in the Castle of <HI>Musco,</HI>
were not for changing their present plentiful Con∣dition
for the To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Chances of War; so that,
when the King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der'd them to prepare for the
March, they unanimously declar'd that they would
not stir unless they receiv'd full Satisfaction for their
Arrears.</P>
<P>The King, tho' disappointed in the Assistance of
those Troops, in which he confided most, having
receiv'd a Reinforcement of two thousand <HI>German</HI>
Foot, directed his March towards <HI>Smolensko,</HI> where
by the Accession of those Forces that Quarter'd
thereabouts, he hop'd to be in a Condition to at∣tempt
the Relief of his Subjects within the Castle
of the City of <HI>Musco.</HI> But the same Evil Genius
which had alienated the Confederate Forces from
his Service did follow him to <HI>Smolensko.</HI> For the
Horse in those Parts, after the Example of their
Brethren in <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> declar'd that
they would not stir out of their Quarters till their
Arrears were paid them. King <HI>Sigismund</HI> wanting
Money to satisfie their Demands, and Strength to
reduce them to Obedience, was fain to have Re∣course
to Entreaties and Promises not only of
their Arrears, but also of vast Rewards; but these
verbal Temptations not making the least Impression
upon the Souldiers, the King declar'd that if they
all refus'd to follow him, he would in Person at
the Head of his Guards only march to the Relief
of his Subjects in <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the Horse, overcome with Shame and
the Perswasions of their Officers, who upbraided
them with Cowardice and want of Loyalty,
being at last prevail'd upon, not to leave the King
<PB N="137" REF="208"/>
at this critical Juncture, <HI>Sigismund</HI> resolv'd to pro∣secute
his March to <HI>Viasna,</HI> mid-way betwixt <HI>Smo∣lensko</HI>
and the City of <HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>I had almost forgot to have mention'd here an
Accident that hapned to the King at the time of
his marching out of one of the Gates of <HI>Smolensko,</HI>
which is call'd the <HI>Kings Gate,</HI> the same was in∣terpreted
as an inauspicious Omen to <HI>Sigismund.</HI>
For it hapned, that just at the same Instant as he
was to go thro' the abovemention'd Gate, the
Portcullice fell down and stopp'd his Passage; so
that he was forced to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn back and take another
Way to <HI>Viasna,</HI> where he halted, expecting to be
join'd by some other Forces, that were quarter'd
in the neighbouring Provinces.</P>
<P>Whilst the King, who was always dilatory in his
Affairs, was advancing with slow Marches towards
the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> the <HI>Russians</HI> had pressed on the
Siege of the Castle with more Vigour than before,
and having perfected their Lines on all sides, and
fortified them with Redoubts at convenient distan∣ces,
and reduc'd the <HI>Poles</HI> within to great Straights,
who, for want of a sufficient Number of Foot,
were no longer able to maintain their Works, much
lest to hinder the App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oaches of the Enemy. How∣ever,
they supplied the Defect of their Foot by
the Service of their Horse, who during the whole
Summer, notwithstanding all the Passages were
fortified and guarded by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> at several
times broke thro' their Lines and brought in Pro∣visions
for the Garrison. But these Supplies being
brought in so small Quantities as not to bear any
proportion with the Necessities of the Soldiers, who
were at last reduced to extream Want, <HI>Chodkievitski</HI>
resolv'd to make his last Effort, and to try whether
he could not by the same Way of the River,
which he had made use of before, bring in a Sup∣ply
of five hundred Waggons, laden with all man∣ner
of Provisions into the Castle.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="209"/>
For which purpose having order'd a Sally to be
made with the greatest part of the Horse, and all the
Foot within the Castle, they by break of day for∣ced
the Guards of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> on the other side
of the River <HI>Mosca,</HI> to facilitate the Passage of
their Convoy, which they met at some di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance
from the Town. But they advancing very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowly
by reason of the great Number of Waggons, the
<HI>Muscovite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> had sufficient Leisure given them to
draw the greatest part of their Forces out on that
side, so that at their Return they were warmly re∣ceived
by the whole Power of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who
knowing the Fate of the Siege to depend from the
Success of this days Action, fought with great Ob∣stinancy.
The <HI>Polish</HI> Horse, induced by the same
Motives fought like Men resolved to conquer or to
dy, and, notwithstanding the great Inequality of their
Number, had brought the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Horse into
Confusion, and would in all likelihood have carried
the Day, if they had been duly seconded by their
Foot commanded by <HI>Strusius.</HI> But he being a near
Kinsman and Creature of <HI>Potocki,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poles</HI> bea∣ten by the <HI>Musco∣vites.</HI></NOTE> who, as we
mentioned before, look'd with an ill Eye upon the
Advancement of <HI>Chodkievitski,</HI> under pretence of
guarding the Convoy of Provisions, advanced so
slowly to the Rescue of the Horse, that being sur∣rounded
on all sides, they had enough to do to
fight their Way thro' into the Castle, without being
able to execute their Design, and were soon after
followed by the Foot, who were forced to leave
all the Provisions intended for their Relief to the
disposal of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Thus the Hopes which King <HI>Sigismund</HI> had con∣ceived
of the conquering of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire
vanished with his Overthrow, which at once lost
him all the Fruits of his former Victories, acquir'd
with the Effusion of so much Blood, and the Ex∣pence
of a vast Treasure.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Muscovites</HI> having received certain Intel∣lig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce
that King <HI>Sigismund</HI> was preparing to ad∣vance
to their Rescue, doubled their Guard in all
<PB N="139" REF="209"/>
their Avenues leading to the Castle, and so straightly
enclos'd the Garrison within the Limits of their Walls,
that they took from them all Hopes of receiving
any further Supplies of Provisions. The <HI>Poles</HI> on
the other Hand knowing the Importance of the
Place which was committed to their Custody, from
whence depended in a great Measure the Fate of
the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire; and living in dayly Expe∣ctation
of the Approach of their King, endured all
the Extremities of Famine with an unparallell'd
Resolution. For after having consumed every
thing that was eatable, not only Horses, Cats, Dogs,
Rats, Mice, and other living Creatures, but also
the Leather and Coverts of their Trunks and Sad∣dles;
they proceeded to Human Flesh, feeding
upon the Carcasses of their Comrades. But this
having in a little time caused a most violent Conta∣gion
among them, and receiving no certain Intelli∣gence
of the further Approach of the <HI>Polish</HI> Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poles</HI> surrender he Castle of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sco.</HI></NOTE>
their Obstinacy was forced to yield to the Extre∣mity
to which they were reduced by the Watchful∣ness
of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> and the slow Advances of
their Countrymen, so that they surrender'd them∣selves
at Discretion, after having given a thousand
evident Proofs of their Courage and Loyalty du∣ring
this long and remarkable Siege.</P>
<P>King <HI>Sigismund</HI> had been all this while trifling a∣way
his time at <HI>Viasna,</HI> where having received this
fatal News of the Surrender of the Castle of <HI>Musco,</HI>
he and the whole Army were put into such a Con∣sternation
as is not easie to be express'd. Being at
the greatest Incertitude that possibly could be, what
to resolve upon at this critical Juncture, he called
together all his ablest Counsellours and most expe∣rienced
Officers, to consult what was best to be
done. There were not a few who advised him to
lay aside all further Thoughts of the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
Crown, and, in a far advanced Season, not to ex∣pose
his Person and the whole Army to eminent
Danger among a Treacherous People. But the
major Part were of Opinion, that the Pretences to
<PB N="140" REF="210"/>
the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire ought not to be quited at so ea∣sie
a Rate; that if he, without any further Delay,
advanced into the Heart of the Country, it was
not improbable that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> over-awed by
his Presence at the Head of a good Army, whilst
their Affairs were yet in an unsettled Condition,
might be induced rather to adhere to their former
Election of Prince <HI>Vladislaus,</HI> than to expose them∣selves
afresh to the Hazards of a ruinous War. And that
in case they should be disappointed in their Expecta∣tion,
it would be more glorious for them to pro∣cure
an honourable Peace with their Swords in Hand,
than shamefully to turn their Backs to their Ene∣mies,
whereby they would be encouraged to carry
the War into the <HI>Polish</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rritories.</P>
<P>The King having given his Approbation to the
latter, it was resolved to march immediately to∣wards
<HI>Federoviscum,</HI> where having set up their
Head Quarters, the King detached a considerable
Body of Horse, to advance to the very Walls of the
City of <HI>Musco.</HI> They were no sooner come within
sight of that City, but they were received with
good store of Shot from the Walls, which being
seconded by a furious Sally, the <HI>Polish</HI> Horse were
forced to retire with the Loss of some of their
Companions. The King judging by the Entertain∣ment
given to his Troops before the Imperial City
that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> had laid aside all Thoughts of
receiving his Son <HI>Vladislaus</HI> for their Great Duke,
and finding himself not in a Capacity at present to
force them to a Compliance, was uncertain what
Measures to take. The worst of all was, that the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> in the circumjacent Provinces, upon the
first News of the Surrender of the Castle of <HI>Musco,</HI>
and the Approach of the <HI>Polish</HI> Army, had carried
all their Provisions into their strong Holds; so that
King <HI>Sigismund</HI>'s Army which consisted most of Ca∣valry,
was in great Distress for want of Forage
in a Country where the Winter-Season affords no∣thing
in the Field for the Sustenance of Horses, and
makes encamping almost intolerable to the Soldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="210"/>
The evil Posture of their Affairs gave occasion to
frequent Consultations in the <HI>Polish</HI> Camp, where it
was at last resolved to attempt to make themselves
Masters of some Place of Strength, whereby they
might at once supply thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present Necessity, and se∣cure
themselves a secure Retreat in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the
Country, till they might find an Opportunity to
take new Measures against next Spring. <HI>Volock</HI> was
the Place pitch'd upon as the fittest for their
present Purpose, which the <HI>Poles,</HI> enraged at their
ill Success, attacked with incredible Fury, but their
ill Fortune seem'd to follow them wherever they
came; for the <HI>Muscovites</HI> having in fresh Remem∣brance
the Ravages committed by the <HI>Poles,</HI> and
especially the Burning of the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> look∣ed
upon them no otherwise than the mortal Ene∣mies
of their Country, and therefore defended
themselves with such a Resolution as sufficiently
shewed that they would rather bury themselves in
the Ruins of the Place than suffer them again to
get footing in the Heart of the Empire; so that
after having been repulsed several times with con∣siderable
Loss,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poles</HI> retire out of <HI>Musco∣vy.</HI></NOTE> they had no other Way left them
for their Safety, than to hasten their March towards
<HI>Smolensko,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Poland,</HI> with
the Loss of many of their Souldiers and most of
their Horses.</P>
<P>And thus, after so much Blood-shed, so many Sie∣ges
and Battles, and the Expence of vast Treasures,
ended the Expedition of <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
who by his ill Conduct lost the Crown of <HI>Musco∣vy</HI>
designed for his Son <HI>Vladislaus,</HI> rendred the En∣deavours
of the two unfortunate <HI>Demetrius</HI>'s un∣successful,
and involved the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire in un∣speakable
Miseries, which now by his Retreat be∣gan
to conceive new Hopes of its future Establish∣ment.</P>
<P>For, no sooner had they rid their Hands of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
but they applied all their care towards the rooting
out the Remnants of the Imposture of the <HI>Demetrius's</HI>
for which purpose they sent a considerable Body to∣wards
<PB N="142" REF="211"/>
<HI>Caluga,</HI> to attack those Forces that stood still
out for the Interest of <HI>Marina</HI> and the Young <HI>De∣metrius,</HI>
her pretended Son, under the Command
of <HI>Zarucki</HI> the General of the <HI>Cosacks;</HI> but these
defended themselves with so much Bravery; that
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> finding them so resolute in their
Defence, and fearing lest they should be prevail'd
upon to side with the <HI>Poles</HI> against them, tampered
under-hand with some of their Chief Officers,
who being blinded by the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Gold, brought
over the greatest part of the <HI>Cosacks</HI> to the <HI>Musco∣vite</HI>
Party, and as a Pledge of their future Fideli∣ty,
delivered their Leader, the brave <HI>Zarucki,</HI> and
<HI>Marina</HI> and her supposititious Son into their Hands.</P>
<P>The Unfortunate <HI>Zarucki,</HI> after an Imprisonment
of some Months, was impaled; but as to <HI>Marina</HI>
and the Young pretended <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
were divided in their Opinions; there being not a
few who in regard of the eminent Station she had
born in the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire, and her high Extra∣ction,
endeavoured to save her from the Cruelties
of those who laid all the Outrages committed since
the Beginning of the War by the <HI>Poles</HI> at her Door,
as being in a great Measure the chief Cause of their
Invading the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, and consequently of
all the Miseries they had endured for these ten or
twelve Years last past. They judged it therefore
most conducible to the Settlement of their State,
by her Death to strike at the Root of the Preten∣sions
of the <HI>Demetrius</HI>'s, and to take away all Co∣lour
of future Claim upon that Score: Pursuant to
which Resolution, she and her pretended Son <HI>De∣metrius</HI>
were condemned to be thrust under the Ice.</P>
<P><HI>Marina</HI> received the fatal News with a Constancy
above the ordinary Courage of her Sex, and having
desired only a few Hours to prepare herself for her
last Exit out of this World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marina</HI> and the Young <HI>De∣metrius</HI> drownd.</NOTE> she appeared with a
very grave and composed Countenance, and a Pre∣sence
so Majestick, and out-braving her present
ill Destiny, that she drew Tears even from the
Eyes of her mortal Enemies. She declared, that,
<PB N="143" REF="211"/>
as for her own part, she had of late been so much
accustomed to the perpetual Vicissitudes of For∣tune,
as not to be terrified at her approaching
Death, by which she hoped to exchange her Mise∣ries
for everlasting Joys; That her only Concern
was for the young Babe, whose tender Age, as it
was incapable of committing any Crimes, so her
greatest Grief was to see its Innocence thus invol∣ved
in her Ruin by the Insatiable Revenge of her
Enemies. Being not allowed to say any more, af∣ter
a few Minutes bestowed in pious Ejaculations,
she was with her Babe in her Arms thrust into the
Watery Element, where she and all her Hopes
were smothered under the Ice.</P>
<P>She was a Lady of an immense Ambition, and of
a Greatness of Mind uncommon to her Sex; as her
aspiring Thoughts gave place to all other Considera∣tions,
so the Desire of Empire was the predomi∣nant
Passion of her Soul, which had made her em∣bark
in these Designs which at last proved her
Destruction. The Greatness of her Courage and
Constancy was such, as that she refused even to the
last to be treated at a less Rate than an Empress;
And in the very lowest Ebb of Fortune, such was
her Ambition as to refuse the Letters of certain
Friends, because they had not stiled her Empress
of <HI>Muscovy</HI> in their Superscriptions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> having thus disintangled them∣selves
out of these Troubles which had over-whelmed
their Empire, began now to take breath,
and in order to establish their present Quiet
upon a lasting Foundation, began to consult the
Settlement of the Government, by such an Ele∣ction
as might restore them to their former flou∣rishing
Condition. There were some among the
ancient Nobility, who sufficiently declared their
Inclinations, that by their late Services in having
been instrumental in chasing the <HI>Poles</HI> out of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> they thought themselves entitled to the
Royal Dignity, which was like to have proved the
Source of new Calamities, if the popular Faction
<PB N="144" REF="212"/>
headed by <HI>Prosowecki</HI> and <HI>Boris Sicin</HI> had not de∣clared
peremptorily, that the only Means to re∣settle
their turbulent State, was to revert the Go∣vernment
into its ancient Channel, by chusing one
of the Royal Family of <HI>John Basilovits.</HI></P>
<P>But whilst the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were concerting Mea∣sures
for the Establishment of their State, thinking
to have secured themselves against any further Im∣postures,
by the Death of <HI>Marina</HI> and the preten∣ded
Young <HI>Demetrius,</HI> they were surprized with
the unwelcom News, that the Old <HI>Demetrius</HI> was
revived again, and had appear'd in the North-western
Provinces of the Empire.</P>
<P>This Impostor was of a mean Extraction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fourth counter∣feit <HI>De∣metrius.</HI></NOTE> a
Scrivener by his Profession, but of a bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and
daring Spirit, and a ready Tongue and subtle
Wit; He assum'd the Name of <HI>Demetrius</HI> the Son
of <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> giving it out that besides his
miraculous Preservation at <HI>Vgletz</HI> and in the City
of <HI>Musco,</HI> he had escaped the Hands of the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
at <HI>Caluga,</HI> who in the Fray had murthered a∣nother
in his stead.</P>
<P>The Rumour spread abroad concerning this new
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> soon drew to his Party such of the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> as had lately adhered to <HI>Marina,</HI> and
for fear of Punishment were glad to embrace any
Opportunity to fish in troubled Waters. To these
there flocked abundance of Vagabonds and idle
Persons, the Remnants of the late intestine Broils,
and such as having been by the War indispo∣sed
to any thing of Labour, hoped to live upon
Rapine and the Plunder of the Country.</P>
<P>Finding himself thus on a sudden at the Head
of a considerable Party, he publish'd his Manife∣sto,
wherein he exho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted all his faithful Subjects
to acknowledge him for their lawful Sovereign, as
being the only surviving Issue of <HI>John Basilovits,</HI>
their Great Duke, who having three several times
escaped the Hands of his bloody Enemies did once
more appear to assert his Legal Title to the <HI>Musco∣vian</HI>
Throne.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="212"/>
Perceiving the giddy Multitude ready to swallow
the Bait, he directed his March to <HI>Novogorod Veliki,</HI>
where being received under the Acclamations of the
People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Places de∣clared for him.</NOTE> he after some short Stay, march'd from thence
to <HI>Jama,</HI> and so further to <HI>Ivanogorod,</HI> where the In∣habitants,
after the Example of those of <HI>Novogorod,</HI>
readily opened their Gates, and received him as
Great Duke of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Being encouraged by this
Success, to put the better Countenance upon his
Imposture, he resolved to strengthen his Interest,
if possible by some Foreign Alliances. He judged,
not without reason, that the <HI>Poles,</HI> who had been
so lately baffled in their Design against <HI>Muscovy</HI> at
the Expence of a vast Treasure, and the Loss of so
many of their Countrymen, would not easily be
prevailed upon to try so soon again their Fortune
in a Country where they had drawn upon them∣selves
the general hatred of the People; where∣fore
he thought it more conducing to the present
Circumstances of his Affairs, to implore the Assi∣stance
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who by Reason of the near∣ness
of their Frontiers to those Provinces where he
had established his Interest, were the most likely to
prove most advantageous to his Pretensions.</P>
<P>In order to which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sends an Ambassa∣dor into <HI>Sweden.</HI></NOTE> he sent an Ambassador to
<HI>Charles</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> unto whom having repre∣sented
the Treachery of his unfaithful Subjects a∣gainst
their Lawful Sovereign, he craved his Aid for
the Recovery of his Throne. King <HI>Charles</HI> shewed
sufficient Inclination to hearken to his Propositions,
but considering with himself how it could be pos∣sible
that the same <HI>Demetrius,</HI> after having been
slain three several times, should appear again and
ask his Assistance unless he were immortal, he di∣spatched
the Ambassador of this New <HI>Demetrius</HI>
with this Answer, That he would send an Ambassa∣dor
of his own to <HI>Ivanogorod,</HI> in order to settle e∣very
thing, relating to the proposed Alliance, with
him in Person. King <HI>Charles</HI> had at that time in his
Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, a certain Gentleman whose Name was <HI>Pe∣trejus,</HI>
who had formerly seen the first <HI>Demetrius;</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="213"/>
both in <HI>Poland</HI> and in the City of <HI>Musco.</HI> Know∣ing
him to be a Person of undoubted Integrity, and
being resolved not to be imposed upon by the cun∣ning
<HI>Muscovite,</HI> he sent him as his Ambassador to
this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> then resident at <HI>Ivanogorod,</HI> with
Orders, if he found him to be the same Person
that was acknowledged and crowned as the true
<HI>Demetrius</HI> in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> to conclude an
Alliance with him, and to promise him all possible
Assistance for the Recovery of his Crown and the
reducing his Subjects to their due Obedience. <HI>Pe∣treius,</HI>
being arrived at <HI>Ivanogorod,</HI> demanded, ac∣cording
to his Instructions, immediately Audience
from the supposed Great Duke, which he could not
obtain at that time by reason of a Pretended Indis∣position
of this new modell'd Emperour of <HI>Russia,</HI>
who having got Notice that <HI>Petreius</HI> had personally
known the first <HI>Demetrius,</HI> did not judge it ad∣visable
to admit him into his Presence. <HI>Petreius</HI>
having again demanded Audience, was answered,
That the Great Duke's Indisposition would not
give him leave to receive him in Person, according
to his Quality, but that if he would be pleased to
treat with his Council in the mean while, concer∣ning
such Matters as were within the Compass of
his Instructions, he did not question but that in a
few Days he might be so far re-establish'd in his
Health, as to ratifie the Treaty in Person, and to
shew him all the Honours due to his Character.
<HI>Petreius,</HI> who began to mistrust the Matter, answe∣red,
That the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> his Master, being
desirous to enter into a strict Alliance with his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty, had given him some particular In∣structions,
which he was commanded to communi∣cate
to no body but to him in Person; And having
made reiterated Instances for his Admittance
into the Great Duke's Presence, which was as of∣ten
denied him, under some pretence or other, he
had all the Reason to gather from thence and some
other Observations he made, that this Denial pro∣ceeded
from the Conscience of his own Guilt, and
<PB N="147" REF="213"/>
that all his Pretences were fictitious; Where∣fore
having once more demanded Audience, which
was again denied, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he declared, That since it was
his Misfortune to come at a time when it was not
consistent with his <HI>Czarish</HI> Majesty's Health to be
admitted in his Presence, and that being limited as
to the time of his Return, and not permitted to
disclose his Master's Secrets to any of his Ministers,
he was obliged to return into <HI>Sweden;</HI> But that, if
the Great Duke would send once more his Ambas∣sadors
to the King his Master, he did not question
but that Matters might be adjusted betwixt them
to their mutual Satisfaction. Thus <HI>Petreius</HI> cunning∣ly
dissembling his real Thoughts conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese
frequent Delays and Denials put upon him by the
<HI>Russians,</HI> left <HI>Ivanogorod,</HI> and at his Return gave
King <HI>Charles</HI> a full Account of the Success of his
Negotiation.</P>
<P>The new modell'd <HI>Demetrius</HI> finding himself thus
disappointed in his Hopes of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Aids, yet
did not lose Courage; but having by this time
brought over a consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable Body of the <HI>Cosacks</HI> to
his Party, resolved to appear now in the Field at
the Head of his Army directing his March to the
City of <HI>Plesko,</HI> situate upon a Lake of the same
Name, and one of the most considerable in those
Parts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who look'd at first upon this
Imposture, as so gross and so ill contrived as scarce
worth their taking Notice of, when they saw se∣veral
Places of Note thereabouts to take the Bait,
and the Impostor ready to take the Field with a
considerable Number of Troops, thought it now
high time to run to the quenching of the Fire be∣fore
the Flame should spread it self over the neigh∣bouring
Provinces. Having receiv'd Intelligence
that the Impostor was marching towards <HI>Plesko,</HI>
they ordered their Army to march also to the Re∣lief
of that Place; which being by the Counter∣feit
<HI>Demetrius</HI> summoned to a Surrender, was just
upon the point of complying with his Demands,
<PB N="148" REF="214"/>
when the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army advancing, he took the
Alarm, and finding himself not in a Capacity to
fight an Army much superiour to him both in
Number and Goodness of the Soldiers, he resolved
upon a hasty Retreat, which was done with so
much Precipitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is routed.</NOTE> that he was forced to leave all
his Cannon and Baggage behind him, which fell in∣to
the Hands of the Enemies, who also pursued
and dispersed his Troops, himself scarce escaping to
<HI>Ivanogorod.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites,</HI> believing there was nothing
more to be done for them in those Parts, marched
back with their Army to the Capital City; but it
was not long after they had withdrawn themselves
out of the Neighbourhood of <HI>Plesko,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is invited to <HI>Plesko.</HI></NOTE> when the In∣habitants
of that City sent their Deputies to <HI>Ivano∣gorod</HI>
offering themselves and their Town to the
Service and Protection of this Impostor.</P>
<P>He, who but a few days before had looked upon
his Affairs as desperate and past redress, being over-joyed
at so unexpected a Success, re-assumed new
Courage, and being resolved to improve so favou∣rable
an Opportunity to his Advantage, went im∣mediately
with what Troops he had left after his
late Retreat to <HI>Plesko,</HI> where he was received with
all the Demonstrations of Joy, and Honour due to
their Lawful Sovereign.</P>
<P>If he had been as careful to maintain the good O∣pinion
of the Citizens of <HI>Plesko,</HI> as he had been
vigilant in procuring it, the Accession of so consi∣derable
a Place might have proved of great Conse∣quence
to his Affairs; but, instead of improving
it to his Advantage, he gave himself over to
all manner of Debauchery and Licentiousness,
and his Officers, following the Footsteps of their
Leader, committed all manner of Insolencies upon
the People, by debauching and violating their Wives
and Daughters; so that at last the Citizens of <HI>Ples∣ko,</HI>
being convinced of their Mistake, and not any
longer able to endure their Villanies, took a Reso∣lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
to rid their Hands of these new Guests.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="214"/>
For which purpose being met at a certain Day
appointed for that purpose early in the Morning
well armed, they attacked and beat his Guards,
and forced him to fly the City. The <HI>Cosacks</HI> seeing
him thus forsaken by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> resolved not
to stay long behind, but to leave him with the first
Opportunity. But some of the Officers conside∣ring
with themselves, that if they could seize upon
his Person, they might, by so acceptable a Present
the sooner make their own Peace, and obtain Par∣don
for their Rebellion, resolved to seize him and
to deliver him up to the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> They were
just upon the point of putting their Design in Exe∣cution,
when he mistrusting the Matter, clapp'd
Spurs to his Horse, and would without Question
have saved himself by the Swiftness of his Horse,
if he had not been overtaken by an Arrow out of
a <HI>Cosacks</HI> Bow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is taken and exe∣cuted.</NOTE> which having wounded him in
the Shoulder, he was taken, and being bound
Hand and Foot, sent to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> where
he was hang'd in a Chain before one of the Gates of
that City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> in the mean while having consul∣ted
their own Safety after some Contests among the
Nobles, at last, by the universal Suffrage of the
People, chose <HI>Michael Federovits,</HI> the fatal Youth
so much feared by <HI>Zuski,</HI> their Great Duke, who
happily maintained himself in the Throne, and re∣stored
Tranquility to the shatter'd Empire of
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> as will appear out of the following
Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing the History of the Reigns of
Michael Federovits, of Alexi Mi∣chaelovits,
his Son, and Fedor A∣lexiovits
the Eldest Brother of the
present Grand Czar of Muscovy.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MIchael Federovite</HI> was the Son of <HI>Fedor Nikitis,</HI>
who being descended from the Race of the
Great Duke <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> by one of his Daught∣ters,
had during the last Troubles in <HI>Muscovy</HI>
lived a very retired life; And at last having forsa∣ken
his Wife for God's sak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as they call it in <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
embraced a Religious Life, and soon after
was made Patriarch, when he changed the Name
of <HI>Fedor</HI> into <HI>Philaretes.</HI> His Son was scarce seven∣teen
years of Age when he was crown'd Great
Duke of <HI>Russia,</HI> in the Year 1613, with one of the
Diadems which they found among the Rapines of
the <HI>Poles,</HI> notwithstanding which he governed the
<HI>Russian</HI> Empire with a great deal of Prudence, ta∣king
the Advice of his ablest Counsellors, but
especially of his Father in all Matters of any
Moment.</P>
<P>The first thing he did, after his Coronation, was
to recompence the Services of <HI>Prosowecki, Boris Sicin,</HI>
and the General of the <HI>Dunensian Cosacks,</HI> who had not
only signaliz'd themselves by their Zeal in driving the
<HI>Poles</HI> out of <HI>Muscovy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Truce be∣gun▪ be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wixt the new Great Duke and the <HI>Poles.</HI></NOTE> but also had been very instru∣mental
in his Election. Those he constituted Gene∣rals
of his Armies, and by their Valour obliged the
<HI>Poles</HI> to emancipate them from the Oath which
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> had sworn to <HI>Vladislaus</HI> their Prince,
who was forced to make a Truce with this new
<PB N="151" REF="215"/>
Great Duke for fourteen Years, yet under these Con∣ditions,
That the <HI>Poles</HI> should keep in the mean
time in their Possession the Dukedoms of <HI>Severia,
Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ikow,</HI> and <HI>Smolensko,</HI> which they had taken
during the late Troubles in <HI>Muscovy.</HI> He also re∣newed
the Antient Alliances with the other neigh∣bouring
Princes; and as he was of a very good Na∣ture,
so by the Mildness of his Government he abo∣lished
the Memory of his Predecessors Cruelties,
that, it is granted, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> never enjoyed a
more peaceable and happy Government for many
Ages before. His Father, for whom he had always
expressed so much Respect, as not only to admit
him to all Publick Audiences and Ceremonies,
where he gave him Precedence, died in the Year
1633. Which had almost proved fatal to his Af∣fairs,
by the unfortunate Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> if by
a seasonable Peace he had not prevented the ill Con∣sequences
of so signal a Disgrace.</P>
<P>For the Truce with the <HI>Poles</HI> being expired some
Years before, and <HI>Michael Eederovits,</HI> being resol∣ved
to remove these troublesome Neighbours at
some further Distance from his Frontiers, and to
draw out the Thorn which stuck so close in his
Flesh, meditated the Siege of <HI>Smolensko.</HI> For
which purpose he had brought together an Army of
above an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hundred thousand Men, among whom
were several Thousand <HI>Germans,</HI> and several <HI>Mus∣covian</HI>
Regiments exercised according to the <HI>Ger∣man</HI>
Discipline, and commanded by foreign Offi∣cers;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>
and a great Train of Artillery consisting of
three hundred Pieces of Cannon, and all other
things requisite to carry on the Siege with the ut∣most
Vigour, under the Command of one <HI>Herman
Shein</HI> a <HI>Polander,</HI> who by his changing Religion had
gained him the Affection and Favour of the New
Patriarch. The Reduction of the Place seemed to
be so much the easier, in that the City is encom∣passed
with Hills and only one single Wall built af∣ter
the old Fashion without any Out-works or
Ditch, and that the <HI>Polish</HI> Garrison was not very
<PB N="152" REF="216"/>
numerous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Great Duke besieges <HI>Smo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en∣sko.</HI></NOTE> For which Reason the Great Duke ha∣ving
ordered to attack it with all imaginable Vi∣gour,
the Place was closely besieged in the Year
1633.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> soon made a large Breach in the
Wall on their side, and were resolved to give the
Assault, which was opposed by the General, say∣ing,
That it would be a Reproach to the whole
<HI>Muscovite</HI> Army, that a Handful of <HI>Germans</HI>
should carry away the Honour of the Siege; but
these being encouraged by the rest of the Foreign
Officers of several Nations, mounted the Breach,
and were in a manner Masters of it, when they re∣ceived
positive Orders from the General to retreat,
and that in case of Refusal he would turn his Can∣non
upon them: So that not daring to make any
further Attempt, the whole Army continued the
Siege without doing any thing worth taking No∣tice
of.</P>
<P><HI>Vladistaus,</HI> the New King of <HI>Poland,</HI> had in the
mean while Leisure given him to get together a
Body of Troops, and being encouraged by the Di∣visions
among the Officers in the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Camp,
or invited on purpose (as some will have it) by the
<HI>Muscovian</HI> General <HI>Herman Shein,</HI> marched to the
Relief of the Place. The City of <HI>Smolensko</HI> is
surrounded with Hills and vast Woods, which gave
sufficient Opportunity to the <HI>Poles</HI> to possess them∣selves
of those few Avenues that led to the <HI>Musco∣vian</HI>
Camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disgrace received before <HI>Smolen∣sko.</HI></NOTE> and by which they received their Pro∣visions,
so as that in a little time the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
were reduced to such Straights for want of all
manner of Necessaries, that the General to pre∣vent
their being starved, was forced to capitulate
with the <HI>Poles,</HI> to surrender the whole Army and
Artillery at Discretion, which was to be ransomed
by the Great Duke.</P>
<P>The Loss of so great an Army, put the whole
Empire under a great Consternation, and things
began to look with a very ill Face, especially
when the People began to murmur openly, and
<PB N="153" REF="216"/>
some of the great ones were suspected to have a
Finger in the Treason. King <HI>Vladislaus</HI> sent an
Ambassador to the Great Duke immediately after
this Defeat of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who by his Insolent
Behaviour sufficiently exprest the Sense the <HI>Poles</HI>
had of the present turbulent State of the <HI>Russian</HI>
Empire. He caused the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Pristafs to a∣light
and to uncover themselves first, (which they
refuse to all other Nations) declaring publickly,
that he was not come there to do the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
any Honour, but to receive it from them. He re∣fused
the Great Duke's Horses at his Entrance and
made use of his own. At his Audience he would
needs make his Proposition Sitting, and perceiving
that when he pronounced the Name and Titles of
his King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insolence of a <HI>Polish</HI> Ambassa∣dor.</NOTE> the Boyars did not uncover themselves,
he stopp'd till such time as he saw the Great Duke
command them so to do. King <HI>Vladislaus</HI> had not
so much as sent the usual presents to the Great
Duke (without which otherwise Ambassadors are
never admitted to publick Audience) the Ambas∣sador
only presented him, as from himself, with a
very rich Coach, which the Great Duke having ac∣cepted
of, he sent him before his Departure a
rich Present of Sables, which the Ambassador re∣fused
with Scorn. The Great Duke thereupon sent
back his Coach, which he was so angry at, that he
kick'd the Pristaff, (who brought the Message)
from the Top of a very high pair of Stairs to the
Bottom.</P>
<P>The Great Duke being highly incensed thereat,
yet was fain to dissemble his Resentment, in the
present ill Posture of his Affairs, he only sent
word to the Ambassador, that he knew not whether
this Behaviour of his was according to his Master's
Order, or whether it proceeded from his own violent
Inclinations; That if he had acted according to
the King's Commands, he must have Patience till a
more favourable Juncture should present to give
himself Satisfaction for the Affronts put upon
him; That tho' by his late Disgrace before <HI>Smo∣lensko</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="217"/>
he was at present not in a Capacity to shew
his Resentment as he ought to do, the Event of
the War was nevertheless in the Hands of God Al∣mighty,
who might crown his Arms with better
Success another time; But that if what he had
done was without the King's Order, (as he be∣liev'd)
and upon his own Account, Complaint
should be made of it to the King his Master, from
whose Justice he promised himself ample Satisfa∣ction
for the Rudeness and Insolencies committed
by his Minister. <HI>Michael Federovits,</HI> seeing his Af∣fairs
in so ill a Posture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace be∣twixt the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI></NOTE> thought it most advisable to
comply with the present Exigency of the State,
and to clap up a Peace with the <HI>Poles</HI> in the next
following Year, by Vertue of which the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
renounced all their Pretensions to the two
large Dukedoms of <HI>Smolensko</HI> and <HI>Zernikow.</HI> In
the same Year he caused <HI>Herman Shein,</HI> his General
at the Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> to be executed, with his
Son, and all his Kindred to be banished into <HI>Sibe∣ria,</HI>
by whose Death the Clamours of the People
having been appeased, he reigned afterwards in
great Tranquility, and to the great Satisfaction of
his Subjects, till the Year 1645, when Count <HI>Wol∣mer,</HI>
natural Son to the late King of <HI>Denmark,</HI>
came to this Court, to sollicite his Daughter in
Marriage, which being opposed by the <HI>Russian</HI> Cler∣gy,
who objected, that he was an Heretick; the
Count proffered that his Chaplains should main∣tain
the Truth of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Faith against them,
which the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Priests refusing, the Grand
Czar broke out into a Passion, saying to them, <HI>Why
do you impose upon us a Faith you dare not bring
to Tryal?</HI> A few days after, going very well to
Bed, he was seized at Midnight with a most vio∣lent
Vomiting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Michael Federo∣vits <HI>dies.</HI></NOTE> which put an End to his Life the
next Morning being the <HI>12th.</HI> day of <HI>July,</HI> in the

<P>Some years before his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> starts up.</NOTE> there started up a∣nother

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was extinct some Years before. For of the

into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> died a few Years before the Disco∣very
of this Impostor, without Children. There
was another Lord of the same Family, who had
one Son, named <HI>Michael Basilovits Zuski Scapin,</HI>
who died Young, in the Year 1616, without
Issue.</P>
<P>The Name of this Impostor was <HI>Timoska</HI> (the
Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inutive of <HI>Timothy) Ankudina,</HI> born in the Sub∣urbs
of <HI>Vologda</HI> in the Province of the same Name.
He was the Son of a Linen Draper who dealt in
coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Cloaths, whose Name was <HI>Demki Ankudina,</HI>
and his Mother was called <HI>Salmaniska.</HI></P>
<P>The Father having observed something more than
Ordinary in him, had been very careful of giving
him the highest degree of <HI>Muscovite</HI> Education,
which consists in Reading, Writing, and Singing,
so that he was look'd upon in those Parts as a Per∣son
of an uncommon Capacity. The Excellency
of his Voice and his Skill in Singing, had particu∣larly
recommended him to the Archbishop of the
Place, who took him into his Service, wherein he
behaved himself so well, that he bestowed one of
his Grand-daughters upon him in Marriage.</P>
<P>After the Archbishop's Death, having squandred
away his Wifes Fortune, he settled himself in the
City of <HI>Musco,</HI> where by the recommendation of a
Friend he had at Court, he was made one of the
Receivers in the Office, that is kept there for the
Licensing of Taverns and Tippling-Houses. But
giving himself over to all manner of Extravagancies
<PB N="156" REF="218"/>
and Debaucheries he could not make up his Accounts,
which fell short the first year by a considerable Sum.
To repair this Breach, he had recourse to an intimate
Friend of his, one of his fellow-Receivers in the
same Office, called, <HI>Basili Gregorovits Spilki,</HI> him he
told, that one of the chiefest Merchants of <HI>Volog∣da,</HI>
a near Relation of his Wifes, was come to
Town, and had invited him to Dinner; that he
being willing to shew his Friend the highest Act of
<HI>Muscovian</HI> Civility, intended to let him see his Wife;
and that he might be able to present her in a Condi∣tion
suitable to his present Statio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he intreated him
to lend him his Wifes Pearls and other Jewels,
which were of a considerable Value. His Friend ha∣ving
without the least difficulty granted his Request,
lent him the Jewels, without the least Precaution,
or taking any thing under his Hand for the Receipt
of them; so that, when he demanded his Jewels,
<HI>Timoska</HI> averr'd that he had not lent him any. <HI>Spil∣ki</HI>
clapt him up in Prison, but having no Evidence
against him, he was acquitted.</P>
<P>But instead of making up his Accompts with the
Money he received for the Jewels, which he sold, he
squandred it away upon his Extravagancies; where∣upon
great differences arising betwixt him and his
Wife, who had a very lewd Tongue, and would
frequently upbraid him with his treacherous Deal∣ings,
both to his Prince and Friend, and fearing that
he might be called to an Account for his Perfidious∣ness,
and that his Wife might be the main Instru∣ment
of his Discovery, he took a Resolution to
dispatch her with the first Opportunity.</P>
<P>For which purpose, having sent his Son <HI>Tereska</HI>
to a Friend of his in the Country, he shut his
Wife up in a Stove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnt his Wife.</NOTE> and set the House on fire,
which consumed her and some of the neighbouring
Houses.</P>
<P>Having done this he went into <HI>Poland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ires in∣to <HI>Poland.</HI></NOTE> but so
secretly, that it was the general Opinion in the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Musco,</HI> that he had been consumed with his
Family. He continued two Years under a borrow'd
<PB N="157" REF="218"/>
Name in the City of <HI>Warsaw,</HI> at the Court of <HI>Vla∣dislaus</HI>
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> when hearing that a <HI>Musco∣vite</HI>
Ambassador was on his Way to that Court, and
not thinking himself secure, he retired to <HI>Chmiel∣niski</HI>
the General of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> unto whom ha∣ving
represented, that he was a near Kinsman of
the Great Duke <HI>Basili Zuski,</HI> and was prosecuted
upon that Score by the present Czar, <HI>Michael Fede∣rovits,</HI>
he begg'd his Protection, and was received
with all the Respect due to his pretended Quality.
As he had a ready Wit, so he carried on the Impo∣sture
under such specious Pretences, that he began to
be very considerable among the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> who flattered
themselves with his future Protection, at a time
when they were very uneasie under the <HI>Polish</HI> Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> had by this time got some Scent
of the Matter, wherefore the Great Duke sent one
of his Gentlemen Ushers, named <HI>Jacob Koston,</HI> to
the <HI>Cosack</HI> General, with an offer of his Pro∣tection
against the <HI>Poles,</HI> and to demand the Im∣postor.</P>
<P><HI>Timoska</HI> having got Notice of the Arrival of the
<HI>Muscovian</HI> Poslanick, and guessing at his Errand,
thought himself no longer safe among the <HI>Cosacks,</HI>
who he feared would secure him for their own Ad∣vantage,
and so went to <HI>Constantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to <HI>Turky,</HI> and tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Mahome∣tan.</NOTE> where ha∣ving
abjur'd the Christian Religion he embraced

<HI>Russia,</HI> if by their Assistance he might be placed in
the Throne of his Father the Great Duke <HI>Basili
Zuski;</HI> but these giving no great heed to his Pro∣positions,
he did not stay long there, but took the
first Opportunity to be transported by a <HI>Venetian</HI>
Vessel into <HI>Italy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Comes to <HI>Rome</HI> and turns <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Ca∣tholick.</NOTE> From <HI>Venice</HI> he went to <HI>Rome,</HI>
where he professed the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion,
and by the same Artifices that he had made use of

that Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gion in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> endeavoured to bring o∣ver

<PB N="158" REF="219"/>
of <HI>Rome</HI> being by this time better acquainted with
the State of <HI>Muscovy</HI> than they were some Years
before, when they were so miserably imposed up∣on
by <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and knowing that Empire so sett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
of Impostors, would not act with so much precipi∣tation
in an Affair of such Moment, but resolved to
amuse him with fair Promises, till they might be
fully satisfied as to the Legality of his Pretensions.</P>
<P>But <HI>Timoska,</HI> either judging these Resolutions
too slow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes to <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> and from thenc' into <HI>Transyl∣vania.</HI></NOTE> or at least not suitable to his Purpose,
went thence to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and from thence to Prince
<HI>Ragotzi</HI> in <HI>Transilvania.</HI> This Prince furnished
him with Letters of Recommendation to <HI>Christina</HI>
Que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>This Princess finding him a Person of great Dex∣terity,
and a considerable Share of Knowledge
(for he had in his Travels attained the <HI>Latin,
German, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Languages) and gi∣ving
credit to what he had related concerning
his Quality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is well re∣ceived by <HI>Christian</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden.</HI></NOTE> refused to appear in Arms for his Inte∣rest,
but allow'd him a very honourable Subsi∣stance;
so that he was look'd upon by every Bo∣dy
and treated as the true Son of <HI>Basili Zuski</HI> Great
Duke of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>But the Czar Regent having soon been acquain∣ted
by the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Merchants residing at <HI>Stock∣holm,</HI>
how this Impostor was received by the Queen
sent the same Poslanick, who had seen him before
with <HI>Chmielniski</HI> the General of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> to de∣tect
the Fraud, and at the same time to desire her
to deliver this Villain into his Hands.</P>
<P>But <HI>Timoska</HI> had no sooner got Notice of the
Arrival of this Gentleman, but knowing his
coming to presage no good to his Affairs, got a∣way,
without taking his Leave, from his Man
<HI>Kostka (Constantine)</HI> the constant Companion of
his Adventures, who was carried in Chains into
<HI>Muscovy. Timoska</HI> was by Order from the Queen
of <HI>Sweden</HI> secured at <HI>Reval</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> who in∣tended
to have also sent him to the great Duke;
but having found Means to get out of the Prison
<PB N="159" REF="219"/>
(by the Connivance of the Governour of the Place
as it was believ'd) he made his Escape into <HI>Holland,</HI>
from whence he went to <HI>Brussels</HI> where he tarried
for some time in that Court.</P>
<P>From thence he went to the University of <HI>Wit∣tenberg,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turns</HI> Lu∣theran.</NOTE>
and soon after to <HI>Leipzick,</HI> where he
made Profession of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Religion, and
writ himself his Confession of Faith in the <HI>Latin</HI>
Tongue.</P>
<P>After some Stay there he went to <HI>Newstadt</HI> in the
Country of <HI>Holstein,</HI> where having been discove∣red
by a Messenger of the Great Duke's, called
<HI>Peter Micklaf,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seized in <HI>Holstein.</HI></NOTE> he was taken by Order from the
Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> who caused him to be conveyed
from thence to <HI>Gottorp,</HI> his usual place of Residence,
and to be secured under a strong Guard, till the
Great Duke should send express Orders for the
bringing his Person into <HI>Muscovy.</HI> Czar <HI>Alexis Mi∣chaelovits,</HI>
Son and Successor to <HI>Michael Federovits,</HI> ha∣ving
received Notice of the Seisure of this Impostor,
not only sent his Letters to the Duke of <HI>Holstein
Gottorp,</HI> where he desired to have him delivered
into the Hands of such as he had appointed for
that purpose, but also (to bring to light the Villanies
of <HI>Timoska,</HI> beyond all Contradiction) sent a∣mong
his Deputies the same <HI>Spilki,</HI> whom for∣merly
he had cheated of his Wife's Jewels, and
who had been his Fellow-Officer in the same Em∣ployment.</P>
<P><HI>Spilki</HI> was no sooner arrived at the Court of the
Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> but he desired to be confronted
with him in the Presence of some Officers of the
Court, not questioning but that his Presence would
soon bring him to an ingenuous Confession of the
whole Truth.</P>
<P>But they were not a little surprised when they
saw <HI>Timoska</HI> without the least Alteration in his
Countenance or Behaviour, treat <HI>Spilki</HI> as if he had
never known him before, and speak to him in the
<HI>Polish</HI> Language, which <HI>Spilki</HI> did not very well
understand, and being asked several Questions by
<PB N="160" REF="220"/>
him in relation to his past Life, especially as to his
Name, whether it were not <HI>Timoska Ankudina,</HI>
whether he had not defrauded the Great Duke's
Treasury, whether he had not cheated him of his
Wife's Jewels, burnt his House, and committed
other enormous Crimes? <HI>Timoska</HI> answered care∣lesly,
That it was possible that one <HI>Timoska Ankudina</HI>
might have converted the Great Duke's Money
to his own use, and committed many other Villanies,
but that this was no Concern of his; That his
Name was <HI>Johannes Sinensis,</HI> (which in the <HI>Polish</HI>
Language signifying as much as <HI>Zuski,</HI> he cunningly
evaded thereby what he had form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly declared of
his being the Son of the Great Duke <HI>Basili Zuski)</HI>
and that as to what he spoke of his Wife's Jewels
could not have the least Relation to him, his Ex∣traction
having put him above the Rank of a poor
Mechanick or Seller of Pins, alluding to the Word
<HI>Spilki,</HI> which in the <HI>Russian</HI> Tongue signifies as
much as <HI>Pinmaker.</HI></P>
<P>He had some time before upon the Perswasion of
a certain <HI>Russian</HI> Gentleman writ a Letter with his
own Hand to the Patriarch of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> in which
he had writ, That he was a <HI>Muscovite</HI> born, and
received the Name of <HI>Timoska</HI> at his Baptism.
That he had once (when he was at the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Court) been tempted to enter the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire
with an Army of two hundred thousand <HI>Tartars,</HI>
but that he had been diverted from this pernicious
Design by the Guardian-Angel of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> That
thereupon being resolved to lay aside all Designs a∣gainst
his Native Country, he had quitted <HI>Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
with an Intention to return into <HI>Muscovy;</HI> That
it would else have been no difficult Matter for him
to have made his Escape out of Prison if he had
not stayed for the Great Duke's Command.</P>
<P>This Letter being look'd upon as a material
Point to overcome his Obstinacy, was produced and
read in his Presence, but this had no more Influence
over him than the Presence of <HI>Spilki,</HI> whom he
called a Cheat who had conterfeited the Letter to
<PB N="161" REF="220"/>
his Destruction. To confirm which, he writ ano∣ther
Letter so different both in the Stile and Chara∣cter
from the former, that the most quick-sighted
could not find the least Resemblance betwixt
them.</P>
<P>His Highness the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> seeing all their
Endeavours of making a true Discovery of the
Imposture to prove unsucessful, ordered some of
his Privy Council to examine him, and to try
whether, out of his former Depositions they might
not be able to convince him concerning the true
State of his Affairs. They asked him, For what
Reason he was prosecuted by the Great Duke;
what could be the Reason of his having con∣ceived
so particular a Prejudice against his Person?
What House and Family he was descended of?
And whether he were of any Kin to the Great
Duke? He answered, That he was no Kinsman of
the Great Duke, forasmuch as his Father was a
Prince born; whereas the Great Duke's Father was
but a Gentleman; That he was a <HI>Muscovite</HI> by
Extraction, but born and brought up in <HI>Poland;</HI>
That he was Hereditary Lord of <HI>Hukagina Severska▪</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Novogarka Severskio,</HI> upon the
Frontiers of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> That his Name was <HI>Johan∣nes
Sinensis,</HI> which in the <HI>Polish</HI> Language signifies
as much as <HI>Zuski;</HI> That his Fathers Name was <HI>Ba∣sili
Domitian Suiski,</HI> who had received his Name
from the City of <HI>Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> in <HI>Muscovy.</HI> That he was
persecuted by the Great Duke upon no other Ac∣count,
that he knew of, than that of his high Ex∣traction.</P>
<P>But these Depositions varying much from what
he had publickly professed before, that he was Son
to the Great Duke <HI>Bassli Zuski,</HI> and that he was
born in <HI>Poland,</HI> with a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> many other inconsi∣stencies,
which sufficiently testified the distractions
of his Conscience; he was by the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI>'s
Order delivered into the Hands of the Deputies of
the Great Duke.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="221"/>
<HI>Timoska,</HI> finding that these Evasions would stand
him no longer in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tead, fell into Despair, and took
a Resolution to kill himself▪ For which purpose,
being upon his Way from, <HI>Newstadt</HI> to <HI>Travemund,</HI>
in order to be put on Board the Vessel that was to
carry him to <HI>Archang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> he threw him∣self
down headlong from the Waggon, striving to
shuffle himself under the Wheels, in Hopes they
would pass over his Body; But the Ground hap∣pening
to be sandy and soft, his Fall did him no
harm; and the Waggon being stopp'd immedia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely
before the Wheels touch'd any part of his Body,
they put him again into his Place, where they fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ned
and watch'd him so narrowly, that he could not
find the least Opportunity of putting his Design in
execution. Notwithstanding which he appeared
very chearful during the whole Voyage, thinking
thereby (as it was supposed) to make his Keepers
the more careless, till he might find Means to be
his own Executioner, and so avoid the Torments
which he knew were prepared for him in <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>For no sooner was he arrived at <HI>Archangel,</HI> but he
fell in so deep a Melancholy, that he appear'd quite
disconsolate, and would scarce utter one Word.</P>
<P>From thence he was carried to <HI>Novogorod Veliki,</HI>
and so to the City of <HI>Musco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Musco.</HI></NOTE> where he was imme∣diately
condemned to the most exquisite Tortures.
This was put in Execution in the Presence of seve∣ral
Boyars and other Persons of the first Rank;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tortur'd.</NOTE>
but they could not prevail over his Obstinacy, he
refusing to give the least Answer to the Questions
proposed to him. He only told them, That
if they would send for Knez <HI>Nikita Ivanovits
Romanow,</HI> he was the only Man whom he
thought worthy to receive his Confession, as know∣ing
him to be a Person of great Honour and Cou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age.
While two of the Boyars there present were
gone to find out <HI>Nikita,</HI> he desired somewhat to
drink; whereupon some <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tas</HI> or small Mead was
presented to him, which he refusing, they gave him
some <HI>Hydromel</HI> in a Silver Cup, according to his
<PB N="163" REF="221"/>
Request, which in a scothful manner he only put
to his Lips without tasting the Liquor.</P>
<P>By this time Knez <HI>Nikita</HI> and the other two Boyars
being come in, he gave them a very civil Salute,
but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> persisted in his former Depositions, that
he was the real Son of <HI>Basili Zuski,</HI> Great Duke of
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scovy,</HI> tho' it were sufficiently proved against
him, that he was the Son of <HI>Demki Ankudina</HI> a Lin∣nen
Draper in the Suburbs of <HI>Vologda;</HI> and that
the Great Duke <HI>Basili Zuski</HI> had no Children, but
only two Brothers who both died without any
Male-Issue, one in <HI>Poland,</HI> the other in <HI>Muscovy</HI>
some Years before.</P>
<P>Whilst he endured the Tortures with an uncom∣mon
Resolution, his Mother and Son were sent for,
in hopes that their Presence might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> prevail∣ing
over his Obstinacy, than the Violence of his
Tortures; They both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew themselves at his Feet,
and with Tears and all the tender Expressions they
were capable of, conjured him to undeceive him∣self
and the World, and to acknowledge his Crime.
The Change of his Countenance sufficiently testified
the various Agitations of his Conscience, notwith∣standing
which, he persisted in affirming, that they
were unknown to him, and took him for another
than really he was; expressing in the midst of his
most violent Tortures a most admirable Con∣stancy,
or rather the most resolute Obstinacy in
the World; whether it was that he took a parti∣cular
Pride to confirm in Strangers the high Opi∣nion
they had once conceived of his pretended Ex∣traction;
or that he was assured, that by his Confes∣sion
he could not prevent his Death or obviate his
Miseries, is uncertain.</P>
<P>Last of all, that nothing might be omitted
which could in any wise contribute to overcome
his Obstinacy, and induce him to an ingenuous Con∣fession,
one <HI>John Plessou,</HI> who had been his intimate
Friend, and with whom he had left his Son before
he retired into <HI>Poland,</HI> with several others of his
Fellow-Officers at the Tavern-Office, were brought
<PB N="164" REF="222"/>
before him; who each in their turn, endeavouring
to convince him of his Error, and representing to
him the Danger wherein he put his Soul, in the
Condition he was in, exhorting him to pull off the
Mask which he had made use of for some Years
past to cheat the World, and to create new Distur∣bances
and infinite Miseries to his Native Country;
That the whole Mistery of his Impostures being re∣vealed
to the World by so many undeniable Wit∣nesses
there present, he should not rely any longer
upon these vain Elusions, but consult the eternal
Welfare of his Soul, and not draw any further the
weight of God's Vengeance upon himself. He
seemed to be moved at their Discourse, but conti∣nued
so obstinate in his former Resolution that he
would not speak one Word afterwards.</P>
<P>The next day he was again put to the Torture,
which he endured with the same Resolution, not
vouchsafing to speak one Word. Being searched
and found circumcised, he was immediately carried
to the Great Market-place before the Castle, where
Sentence was pronounced against him and put in
Execution. First they cut off, with an Ax, his
Right Arm below the Elbow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</NOTE> then his left Leg
below the Knee; next, the Left Arm and Right
Leg in the same manner; all which he endured
with an unparalell'd Constancy, and without as
much as a Groan. Last of all, the Head being se∣vered
from his Body, and the Members being set up∣on
Stakes in the Market-place, and the Trunck left
upon the Ground, the last was in the Night devou∣red
by the Dogs, and the next morning the Exe∣cutioner's
Servants dragg'd the Members to the
place where all the City-Dirt is thrown.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that some time before a <HI>Po∣lish</HI>
Ambassador was arrived in the City of <HI>Musco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
And the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who still bore a Grudge to the
<HI>Poles▪</HI> on the Account of the Miseries they had en∣dured
in their last Civil Dissentions, occasioned by
the Contrivances of the several Impostors encoura∣ged
by the <HI>Poles,</HI> had so well timed it as to give Au∣dience
<PB N="165" REF="222"/>
to the Ambassador the same day, that <HI>Ti∣moska</HI>
was put to death, and to lead him in State
through the Market-place, just at the very Hour of
his Execution, where (under some pretence or o∣ther
contrived for that purpose) they make a Halt,
that he might be an Eye-Witness, and be able to
give an Account in <HI>Poland</HI> of the tragical Exit of
that Imposter, whom they had looked upon there
as Son to the Great Duke <HI>Basili Zuski. Kostka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the

of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire. But the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
relate a Story of the Father of this <HI>Boris Ivancvits
Morosou,</HI> which may not be beyond our purpose to
<PB N="166" REF="223"/>
be inserted here. It seems he was a Favorite of
the Tyrant <HI>John Basilovits,</HI> and being a Widower
presumed so much upon his Interest with the Great
Duke, that he begged a certain handsom Lady,
which had been the Tyrant's Mistress, for a Wife;
The Great Duke granted his Request without the
least Difficulty; but whether it was that he repen∣ted
himself of what was done, or meerly to grati∣fie
his cruel Temper, he having got notice that the
said <HI>Morosou</HI> and his new married Lady were at
their amorous Sports one Afternoon in a withdraw∣ing
Room behind the Bath-stove, he got secretly
two wild Bears, conveyed into the Room, who
immediately fell upon them and devoured them
both. This <HI>Morosou</HI> left two Sons, <HI>Boris</HI> and <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leab,</HI>
who being very young, were educated by the said
Tyrant; the eldest of which having improved the
Advantages of his high Birth and Education above
the ordinary Degree, during the intestine Commo∣tions
in the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, was, as I said before,
constituted by Czar <HI>Michael Federovits</HI> Governour
over his Son <HI>Alexis Michaelovits,</HI> whom he used fre∣quently
to charge to follow his Advice in all Af∣fairs
of Moment. Knez <HI>Boris Ivanovits Morosou,</HI>
fearing that his Enemies might take Advantage of
the Princes tender Years, had the Coronation Cere∣mony
performed a few days after his Father's
Death (who was according to the <HI>Russian</HI> Fashion
deposited in the Church of S. <HI>Michael,</HI> wherein
are the Sepulchers of the Great Dukes, the next
Night after his Decease) which was not performed
with all the usual Pomp, they wanting time to
send for all those who are obliged to be present at
this Solemnity. After the Coronation was over,
<HI>Morosou</HI> changed the Quality of Governour into
that of Protector, exercising, during the Princes
Minority, the same Power in the disposing of his
Affairs, as he had done over his Person during his
Father's Life.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="223"/>
Knowing the young Great Duke to entertain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
most profound Reverence for the Dutchess Dowa∣ger
his Mother, he bestowed great Employments
upon all her Kindred, whom he preferred to the
best Governments in the Empire, but: at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
stance from Court, as made them incapable of op∣posing
his Interest. The same Method he made
use of in regard of the Antient Nobility, and such
as had had the chief Administration of Affairs in
the late Great Duke▪s Reign, whom he sent away,
from the Princes Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to far distant Countries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Thus he did with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Rippine</HI> and <HI>Corakin,</HI> the
first of whom he constituted Governour of <HI>Nisi No∣vogorod,</HI>
the last of <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus removed from the Princes Person all
such as he thought might any way oppose his Great∣ness,
and filled all Places of Profit, and Trust at
Court with his own Kindred or Creatures, such as
he knew wholly to depend on his Fortune; He
used frequently to get the Young Prince out of the
Capital City, under pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of Hunting or some
other Divertisements, so to beget in him an Aver∣sion
to Business, whereby the whole Management
of Affairs might fall to this share. But in order
to an entire Establishment of his Fortune, he
thought nothing more conducing to make, sure of
the young Princes Favour; than if he could, get
him to chuse a Wife out of such a Family, as be∣ing
absolutely in his Interest, and where he himself
might engage in an Alliance by Marriage, would
enage both the Prince and Great Dutchess, in his
future Preservation.</P>
<P>The Person he pitch'd upon▪ as most suitable to
his Purpose, was one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Danilovits Mioslauski,</HI> of
obscure Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty, raised by the Death of <HI>Gramma∣tine</HI>
the Chan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llor of the Ambassadors Office, his
Uncle by the Mothers side, whose Servant he had
been formerly. This Man was looked upon with a
very favourable Eye by <HI>Morosou,</HI> by reason of
his constant Attendance on him; and his two

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="168" REF="225"/>
beautiful Daughters, one of which he designed
for the Great Duke, the other for himself.</P>
<P>Whilst this Favourite was thus employing all his
Cunning to establish his Fortune in the near. Alli∣ance
with his Sovereign, he was upon the Point of
having been frustrated in his Hopes, if by his Dex∣terity,
he had not ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icated himself out of that
Difficulty, which was likely to have rendred his
Design abortive. For a certain young Lady, who
was exceedingly beautiful, having been brought
before the young Great Duke without<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Know∣ledge,
the Czar was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an instant with so vio∣lent
a Passion for her, that he presented her with a
Handkerchief and Ring, the usual Present the
Czars of <HI>Muscovy</HI> make to such Ladies as they
chuse for their Spouses. She was to appear again
in Royal Dress in a few days after, when accor∣ding
to Custom, the young Great Duke was to tye
the Crown upon her Head. But <HI>Morosou</HI> having
been by this time sufficiently informed of what had
passed, (tho' managed with great Secrecy) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had
laid the Plot with the Attire-Women, that they
should tye up her Hair so hard as to put▪ her in
a Swoon, which succeed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d according to Expecta∣tion;
For, whilst she was in the Great Duke's
Presence, and they were busied in tying the Orown
about her Head, she fell into a Swoon, which was
presently by those that were present and most of them
Creatures of <HI>Boris Morosou,</HI> construed an Apople∣ctick
Fit; So that the poor old Gentleman, her Fa∣ther,
who believed himself just upon the Point of
being exalted to one of the most eminent Stations
in the Empire, by the Alliance with his Sovereign,
saw himself not only unexpectedly deceived in his
Hopes, but being besides accused of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Treason,
in pretending to put his Daughter, labouring under
such a Distemper, into the Arms of the Great Duke,
was forced to undergo the Strapado, and was ba∣nished
into <HI>Siberia,</HI> where he no sooner arrived, but
he died with Grief, leaving his Family in Disgrace.
The Maid remained a Virgin ever after till her
<PB N="169" REF="225"/>
Death, and was never known to have had any fit
since; and the Emperour, being conscious of the
Wrong done to her and her Father, allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a
large yearly Pension, which made her to be courted
by many of the Nobility▪ whom she all refused,
and kept the Handkerchief and Ring, as Pledges
of the Injury done to her Family.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Morosou,</HI> who having weather∣ed
this Point, and relying upon the Fidelity of
<HI>Ilia Danilovits Miloslauski,</HI> he took the first favou∣rable
Opportunity to speak to the Great Duke con∣cerning
him, and thence to extoll the Beauty and
Deserts of the two Gentlewomen his Daughters.
These Commendations having raised in the Great
Duke a desire to see them, he sent to them under
pretence of a Visit to be made to the Princesses
his Sisters▪ where, having taken a full View of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em both, he became instantly so enamoured with
the Beauty of the Eldest, whose Name was <HI>Mary,</HI>
that he dispatched one immediately to her Father
to bring him the welcom News that the Czar in∣tended
to honour him with his Alliance, and to
marry his eldest Daughter.</P>
<P>It is easily imagined, that as <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iloslauski</HI> was not
altogether unprepared for it, so he received the
Message▪ with the most profound Respect, and
without being in the least discomposed, returning
his most humble Thanks to his Czarish Majesty for
the Honour he intended to do his Family▪ Some
days after the Great Duke sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Presents of a very
great Value to his Bride, and having been informed
concerning the Circumstances of <HI>Miloslauski,</HI> which
being such, as that he and his Family could not ap∣pear
at the Wedding without a present Supply, he or∣der'd
them a considerable Sum of Money to put them
in an Equipage suitable to their Present Condition.
The Marriage Ceremony was performed in the be∣ginning
of the Year 1647,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Young Great Duke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> but very privately for
fear of Witchcraft, a thing much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eaded among
Persons of Quality in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> especially at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Weddings. The Czarissa was a very beautiful
<PB N="170" REF="226"/>
Lady, besides which, her Modest and Religious Be∣haviour,
and many Charitable Actions, made her
afterwards the Darling of the People.</P>
<P>The next thing <HI>Boris Morosou</HI> had to do, was to
petition, for <HI>Ann</HI> the youngest Daughter of <HI>Milo∣slan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ki,</HI>
and Sister to the Empress, which having been
soon granted, he married her in eight days after; so,
that his former Interest being now strengthned by
this new Alliance, his Fortnue was established beyond
the reach of his Enemies. But, his Content at home
was not altogether answerable to his great Fortune
at Court; For, he being a Person pretty well ad∣vanced
in Years, and she a brown Buxsome
Lass, found herself deceived in a great measure in
her Expectation; so that instead of Children, Jea∣lousies
were got, which produced the ordinary Ef∣fects,
to wit, first Contentions, and afterwards (af∣ter
the <HI>Muscovian</HI> way) the House-Discipline; and
some Persons, among whom was also an <HI>English∣man,</HI>
being suspected to have too free an Access to
<HI>Boris Morosou</HI>'s House, were by his Instigation ba∣nished
into <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever his Fortune might be at home, he
was not careless in his Affairs at Court, where in
Conjunction with <HI>Ilia Damilovits-Miloslauski;</HI> the
Great Duke's Father-in-Law, they managed▪ every
thing to their own Advantage: For, they not only
removed most of the Nobility from Court, but, by
degrees▪ cast off all such old Officers of the Hous∣hold
as were yet remaining, in whose stead, they
brought in their own Kindred and Creatures, who
let s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip no Opportunity to enrich themselves at the
Expence of the Publick.</P>
<P>Among others, they had made one <HI>Leponti-Step∣panovits-Plessou,</HI>
Chief Justice of the <HI>Semskoy Duor</HI>
or <HI>Semskoy Pricas,</HI> a Court instituted for the Judg∣ment
of all Civil Causes between the Citizens of
<HI>Musco,</HI> where are also paid the Duties arising from
Places and▪ Houses that are sold; as also the Taxes
levied for the Reparation of Bridges, Gates▪ For∣tresses,
and other publick Buildings. This Man be∣ing
<PB N="171" REF="226"/>
entrusted with a Commission of so large an Ex∣tent,
did abuse his Trust, to the great oppression of
the People. For there was no Extortion so great,
which he was not ready to undertake. He would
receive Presents from both Parties, and afterwards
leave them in the lurch. But not content with
this▪ his common Practice was, to suborn false Wit∣nesses,
whose employment was to bring in Charges
against such of the Citizens of <HI>Musco,</HI> as he knew
to be rich enough to redeem themselves out of his
Persecutions; For, whenever they fell into his
hands, he did not fail by imprisoning, and other vi∣olent
and oppressive Methods, to oblige them
to purchase their Liberty and his Favour with the
ruine of their Fortunes.</P>
<P>He had a Brother-in-Law, whose name was <HI>Pe∣ter▪
Tichonovits Trochanistou,</HI> one of those, whom in
<HI>Muscovy</HI> they call <HI>Ocolnits,</HI> who are one degree un∣der
the <HI>Boyars,</HI> who are chosen out of their Number.
Him they had made President of the <HI>Puskarskoy
Pricas,</HI> and consequently had the oversight over all
the Great Duke's Founders, Furbishers, Cannoneers,
Armourers, Smiths and Carpenters, who wrought
to the Arsenal. These Mechanicks were usually
paid once a Month, according to the Custom of
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>covy,</HI> where Payments are made with greater
Exactness, than in any other Part of <HI>Europe;</HI> in∣stead
of which he used to keep them in Arrears for
many Months together, and in the mean while, to
make use of their Money, to his own Advantage;
and when he had thus droven them to extremity, to
foice them to compound for half, or what they
could get, and to give Acquittance for the whole
Sum.</P>
<P><HI>Miloslauski</HI> and <HI>Morosou,</HI> play'd the same Game
in their several Stations, not only by selling at an
excessive Rate all the Employments in the King∣dom,
but also by procuring Monopolies, which
ruined the Trade of the whole Empire. A∣mong
others they had got a Patent for one of their
own Gang, prohibiting the further use of the com∣mon
<PB N="172" REF="227"/>
Ells, hitherto used in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but instead of
that to make use of certain Iron ones with the Great
Duke's Mark upon them; on purpose to oblige the
People to buy the latter at the Price of a Crown
<HI>per</HI> Piece; whereas they used to buy the others at 8
or 10 <HI>d.</HI> a Piece, whereby a necessity being laid up∣on
the whole Kingdom of having them from the
Patentees at their own Price, they gathered a vast
Sum of Money without giving any Account of it
to the Great Duke's Treasury.</P>
<P>They had also found out another Invention to
raise the Price of Salt from twenty to thirty Pence
<HI>per</HI> Measure, containing about forty Pound Weight.
This proved a heavy Burthen to the People, and of
no Advantage to the Great Duke; For the dearness
of the Salt had hindred the Sale of it, so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bun∣dance
of Fish being lost for want of Salting, the
Great Duke's Revenue suffered by it upon a double
Account.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Musco</HI> had enjoyed the Fruits
of a very quiet and mild Government, under the
Reign of his late Czarish Majesty, who being a
Prince of incomparable Clemency, endeavoured
thro' the whole course of his Reign, to make the
Government easie to his Subjects, who had so long
groan'd under the Calamities of their civil Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten∣sions;
so that finding themselves thus oppressed
beyond all measure, they could not brook this sud∣den
Change, without shewing publickly their Re∣sentments.
The <HI>Muscovites</HI> seldom or never make
their Cab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s over the Bottle, they do not look up∣on
strong▪ Liquor to be a suitable Companion for
those who intend to treat of States Affairs; they
make use of their <HI>Hydromel</HI> and <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> according
to it's primitive and genuine Institution, to exhile∣rate
the Mind and drive away Cares. As they are
the greatest Zealots in the World▪ so they begin
commonly their States Reformations a <HI>Jove,</HI> after
they have been at Divine Service. Here it was the
Chief Citizens used to meet, and to utter their
Complaints against the Oppressions, which they
<PB N="173" REF="227"/>
groaned under by the Mismanagement of the Mi∣nisters
of State, and resolved at last to Petition
the Great Duke for a Redress of their Grievances.</P>
<P>But the main difficulty was, who among them all
durst be so venturesome as to deliver the Petiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;
so that no body being willing to undertake that
Task, a certain day was appointed to give it to the
Great Duke himself with joint Consent▪ as he
should come out of the Castle to go to his Devo∣tion.
They were as yet not so bold as to dare to
attempt any thing against <HI>Morosou,</HI> by reason of
his near Alliance to the Great Dutchess, tho' they
knew him to be the main Istrument of these Cala∣mities
they suffered, but their Petition was, for the
present, chiefly levell'd against <HI>Lepont Stepanovits
Plessou,</HI> who by his most barbarous Exactions being
become insupportable to them, they desired, that
he might be removed from his Office, and his
Place be supplied by some Person of known Inte∣grity,
of whom the People might expect more Ju∣stice.
They had watched several Opportunities to
deliver it to the Prince himself as he was going to
his Devotions or Divertisements, but in vain; for
the <HI>Boyars,</HI> who attended his Person had always
took it from them, telling them that they would
make a Report of it to the Great Duke; but this
being done according to the Instructions received
from <HI>Morosou,</HI> the Petition was not as much as an∣swered,
much less their Grievances redressed.</P>
<P>This hapning so often, that they found themselves
absolutely mistaken in their whole Expectation, it
was resolved, that they should meet together, and
inspite of all the Opposition from the <HI>Boyars</HI> make
their Complaints to the Great Duke by way of
Mouth. The sixth of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1648▪ was
pitch'd upon as a day fit for the execution of their
Design, when they knew the Great Duke was to
be present at a Procession to be made to a Monaste∣ry
in the City, called <HI>Stertenski.</HI></P>
<P>The People were got early together in the Morn∣ing,
in the great Market-place before the Castle, to
<PB N="174" REF="228"/>
see him and his Cavalcade pass by as they were wont
to do upon such like Occasions; But, whether it
was that they did not think themselves strong
enough, other that their Leaders were not
present, they did not make the least Signs of dissa∣tisfaction
at his going to the Monastery▪ But, at his
return, they broke through those that attended the
Great Duke, came up to him, stay'd him, and
taking hold of his Horses Bridle, intreated him to
take their present Case into his Consideration, to
hearken to the just Complaints of his Subjects, con∣cerning
the Injustices and Violences committed by
<HI>Plessou,</HI> desiring that a Person of known Integrity
might be put in his Place, who should better dis∣charge
so great a Trust.</P>
<P>The Great Duke was not a little startled at this
unexpected procedure of the populace, but dissem∣bling
both his Surprize and Resentment, he spoke
to them with a very chearful Countenance, telling
them, that he was much troubled to understand the
Grievances of his good Subjects, occasioned by the
Mismanagement of <HI>Plessou,</HI> that he would forth∣with
examine the whole Matter, and take care that
they should receive due Satisfaction in relation to all
their just Complaints.</P>
<P>The Generality of the people appeared to be well
satisfied with the Great Dukes Promise, which they
testified by their joyful Acclamations; but some
thronging still about the Great Duke's Horse, the
Boyars who attended at this Solemnity, being for
the most part Friends of <HI>Plessou,</HI> gave abusive Lan∣guage
to those who were near to the Czar, thrust∣ing
some away, and striking others with their Whips,
which so incensed the Populace, that the Stones
began to fly about the Courtiers Ears as thick as
Hail, who were forced together with the Great
Duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny in <HI>Mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE> to retire with all speed to the Castle, whither
they were so closely and vigorously pursued by the
People, that maugr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the resistance of the Guards,
they had enough to do to reach the Great Dukes
Lodgings before they were at the Heels of them.
<PB N="175" REF="228"/>
The Strelits (or the Czar's Guards of Musqueteers)
used all their endeavours to stop the Current of the
Populace that were thronging into the Castle Gates,
but their resistance proving fruitless, by reason of
the infinite number of the People, it rather enflamed
than abated their Fury, who cried out with one
Voice▪ that if <HI>Plessow</HI> were not immediately deli∣vered
into their Hands, they would force the Prin∣ces
Lodgings, and lay it level with the ground.</P>
<P>The Clamours and Threats of the People had put
those within into a great Consternation, and not
knowing what course best to take, <HI>Morossou</HI> was or∣dered
to appear in the great Balcony, and to endea∣vour
by his Authority, to appease the Tumult, desiring
them in the Great Dukes Name, to repair to their
respective Homes. He had scarce leisure given him
to speak a few words, when some of the most for∣ward
among them tells him, That they were glad
to see him there, knowing him to be of the same
Stamp with <HI>Plessou,</HI> and that he should expect no
better treatment than the other, which he should
soon experience to his cost. They had no sooner
said these words, but they led the Populace to his
Palace, which being within the Precinct of the Ca∣stle,
they forced, ransack'd, and pull'd down in an
instant, after they had thrown some of his Servants
out of the Windows, because they had made some
Opposition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muscovites</HI> generally shew a great deal of
Veneration to the Images of their Saints, whom
they will save from among the midst of the Flames
at the perils of their Lives; but such wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Ani∣mosity
against <HI>Morosou,</HI> that they spared not the
least thing they found within the compass of his
Palace, destroying all his Furniture of a great va∣lue,
and not sparing the Images of the Saints; they
broke to pieces his Coach of State, the richest that
was ever seen in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> beat out the bottoms of
the Strong Water Barrels, threw his Ladies Jewels
and Pearls into the Street, trod on them with their
Feet, and told her, that it was in respect to the
<PB N="176" REF="229"/>
Great Dutchess her Sister, and the Great Duke, for
whom they had still a great Veneration, that they
did not make her pay with her Life for the Villanies
of her Husband.</P>
<P>But this was only the Prologue to the ensuing
Tragedy. For from thence they went straightway
to the House of <HI>Plessou,</HI> which they ransack'd and
demolish'd in a moment: The same Game they
play'd with the Palace of <HI>Nazri Ivanovits Tziston,</HI>
Lord Chancellour of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> whom they Sacri∣ficed
to their fury, because he had Farm'd the new
Imposition upon Salt. It was his misfortune to be
just then sick in Bed, by reason of an accident that
had hapned within some days before, when meet∣ing
in the streets with a mad Ox, he was thrown
by his Horse with so much violence, that it had put
him in danger of his Life; but hearing how the
Populace was in Arms, and in what manner they
had ransack'd the Palace of <HI>Morosou</HI> and <HI>Plessou,</HI> and
judging, not without reason, that they would also
give him a Visit in his turn, he hid himself under a
great heap of Birch, which at a certain time, the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> make Provision of against the Winter, to
serve their Stores; and to take away all suspicion,
he had caused a good number of Flitches of Bacon
to be laid across of them. He had scarce had leisure
enough to prepare this retiring place, before the
Clamours of the approaching Rabble gave him suffi∣cient
warning what he had to expect from them:
To be short, they forc'd open the Doors, took a∣way
all his rich Movables, and knowing him to be
in no condition of stirring abroad, search'd for him in
all the most abstruse corners of the House, even to
the Cella<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Stables; but not being able to find
him out, he had certainly escaped their Hands for
that time, if he had not been betray'd by one of
his Servants, who being inticed by a good Summ of
Money which was immediately given him, shew'd
them the place where his Master lay concealed.
The enraged Multitude, without any further delay,
draggs him out by the Heels into the streets, where
<PB N="177" REF="229"/>
they immediately cudgelled him to death. This
done, they threw his Body upon the Dunghil, Pil∣lag'd
his House, and laid it level with the ground.</P>
<P>The same they did to the House of <HI>Peter Tichtono∣vits
Trochanistou,</HI> whom we have mentioned before
to have been constituted Overseer over the Great
Duke's Arsenal, and to all others whom they knew
to have any Relation or Dependance on <HI>Morosou;</HI>
which afforded them such a Booty, that they mea∣sured
the Pearls in their Caps; and as for rich Furs
and all Sorts of the best Silk Stuffs, they had such a
Quantity of them as to throw them about in the
Streets for any body to take them up at their plea∣sure.</P>
<P>Whilst the Populace spent the whole day in ran∣sacking
and pulling down of the Houses, those in
the Castle had leisure given them to barricado and
prepare themselves against their Return, which
they expected the next Morning, they continuing
in such a Posture all the Night as sufficiently shew∣ed
they only expected Daylight to renew the old
Game.</P>
<P>The Great Duke in the mean while, having found
his <HI>Muscovite</HI> Guards insufficient the day before to
make head against the Insolencies of the People,
had sent for the <HI>German</HI> Officers with their Regi∣ments
that were quartered near the City, to meet
at their several Rendezvouses, and to march with∣out
delay to the Relief of the Castle. Pursuant
to these Orders they marched the next Morning
with Drums beating, and Colours flying, and Arms
ready, thro' the Heart of the City to the Castle;
whereat the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> being not a little terrified,
durst not attempt to stop their Passage, but instead
of Opposing them, gave them Way, telling them
as they passed by, that they knew them to be Men
of Honour and Courage, who had no dependance
on those Villains who by their Mismanagement abu∣sed
the People, and that they had no Quarrel a∣gainst
them. Having therefore without the least
Opposition taken up their several Posts assigned
<PB N="178" REF="230"/>
them for their Guards, the Great Duke laid hold
of this Opportunity, to endeavour the Appeasing
of the Tumult by the Authority of Knez <HI>Nikita
Ivanovits Romanow,</HI> whom he knew to be much re∣spected
by the People.</P>
<P>He appear'd before them with Cap in Hand, and
told them in the Name of the Great Duke his Ma∣ster,
that he hoped they would be satisfied with the
Promise and Assurance given by his Czarish Maje∣sty's
own Mouth, that he himself would take Cog∣nisance
of the Matter, and remedy the Grievances
of which they complained. That his Majesty had
sent him on purpose to give them fresh Assurances,
that he was not unmindful of his Word, but would
give them all the Satisfaction in this Point they
could reasonably desire, and to advise them to
break up the Assembly and for every one to repair
to his own Home, that he might the better per∣form
what he had promised them the day be∣fore.</P>
<P>This Message being received with the joyful Accla∣mations
of the People, sufficiently testifying their
Approbation, answer was made that they had no
reason to be dissatisfied with the Great Duke, but
with those who made use of his Name and Autho∣rity
to execute their execrable Villanies upon the
People; And that therefore they could not rest
satisfied, nor would they stir from the Place, till
<HI>Boris Ivanovits Morosou, Leponti Stephanovits Ples∣sou,</HI>
and <HI>Peter Tichtonovits Trochanistou</HI> were deli∣vered
up to them▪ that they might revenge upon
their Heads all those Mischiefs they had done the
Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Romanow</HI> shewed them his Acknowledgment
for the favourable Audience they had afforded
him, telling them, that he would immediately go
and acquaint the Great Duke with the Zeal and Af∣fection
they had expressed for his Person, and that
he did not question but that the Great Duke would
grant their Request, and order the Execution of
those three Lords, who had drawn upon themselves the
<PB N="179" REF="230"/>
Hatred of his good Subjects, by their Mismanage∣ment;
but that he was ready to swear to them
by the Cross, that <HI>Morosou</HI> and <HI>Trochanistou</HI> had
made their Escape at the first beginning of the
Tumult, and for the third, he dares engage his
Word, he should be brought to Execution immedi∣ately.</P>
<P><HI>Romanow</HI> being returned to the Great Duke, it
was, after a short Debate, resolved to sacrifice
<HI>Plessou</HI> and <HI>Trochanistou</HI> to the Fury of the People,
who with a great deal of Impatience waited at the
Castle Gatefor the Great Duke's Answer, but to
endeavour by all means possible the Preservation of
<HI>Morosou;</HI> but that, to appease the Rage of the
People, Word should be sent them immediately,
that <HI>Plessou</HI> was coming out forthwith to be sa∣crificed,
and that the other two should receive the
same Punishment, so soon as they were found,
which was done accordingly; and the People being
desired to send for the Executioner to do his Of∣fice,
they had him ready at Hand with all his Ser∣vants
attending at the Castle Gate; whence, in less
than a quarter of an Hours time they saw him
leading the miserable <HI>Plessou</HI> into the Market-place
before the Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plessou <HI>massacred.</HI></NOTE> in order to cut off his Head. But
the People were so exasperated against him, that
they fell upon him immediately with Cudgels so
outrageously that they dispatched him in a Moment.
His Body was dragged by the Feet thro' the Streets,
accompanied with Millions of Curses of the Po∣pulace;
till at last a Monk who had a particular
Spleen against the deceased, cut off his Head, and
carried it away in Triumph.</P>
<P>The Execution of <HI>Plessou</HI> and the reiterated Pro∣mises
of the Great Duke, that the rest, when found,
should come to the same end, begot some calm in
the Peoples Minds, who had sent their Messengers
upon all the Roads leading to the City, in search
after <HI>Morosou</HI> and <HI>Trochanistou;</HI> the first finding his
Escape almost impossible, by reason of the Peoples
searching so closely after him, had found means to
<PB N="180" REF="231"/>
lay concealed at a particular Friend's House,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trochani∣stou <HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cuted.</HI></NOTE> at a little
distance from the City, from whence he returned
by secret ways, the next night into the Castle.</P>
<P>But <HI>Trochanistou</HI> had not the same good Fortune
to escape the Hands of his Enemies, but being over∣taken
upon the Road by some of the Great Duke's
Messengers (who for fear of being thought to have
consented to his Escape, had been forced to employ
all his Care in finding him out) he was brought the
next day, being the 8th of <HI>July,</HI> to the same place
where he used to sit as Judge over the Cannoniers,
Armourers, and others belonging to the Great
Duke's Arsenal; where, by order from the Great
Duke, he had his Head cut off.</P>
<P>By this time the People being informed how <HI>Mo∣rosou</HI>
had been seen in the Country, and ignorant of
his return into the Castle, they seem'd to be satis∣fied
with the Execution of <HI>Trochanistou</HI> for this
time, forbearing to press any further upon the Great
Duke to give them what was not in his power to
do; so that towards Noon they began to disperse,
and prepare to go to their respective Homes.</P>
<P>The same afternoon several Houses (whether by
accident or by the malice of the Rabble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Confl∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration in Houses.</NOTE> who had
not quite cleared the streets and committed great
Insolences, is uncertain) were set on fire, which
made such a Havock in a few hours, that it consu∣med
the whole Quarter of <HI>Czargorod,</HI> or City Roy∣al,
reducing to Ashes all the Houses within the
compass of the White Wall (which surrounds that
Quarter) down to the River <HI>Neglina:</HI> Towards
Night it got over that River into the Great Duke's
Taverns, into his Store-Houses for Strong Waters
and other Provisions, where it consumed above six∣ty
thousand Flitches of Bacon, and an incredible
quantity of <HI>Aqua-Vitae;</HI> which being the most pro∣per
Fuel in the World to nourish the Flame, it
grew so violent, that the Castle was in most immi∣nent
danger to have been reduced to Ashes by this
raging Element; no body endeavouring to stop its
fury, because those who had the Charge of quench∣ing
<PB N="181" REF="231"/>
the Fire being got Drunk, and inebriated with
the Exhalations of the Strong Waters, were inca∣pable
of performing that Service; many of them
lying in the streets choak'd with the Smoak and
Vapours, which so terified the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> that none
among them durst approach the Flames.</P>
<P>About Mid-night some Foreigners looking with
no small astonishment on the Fire, which just then
had seised upon one of the Store-Houses, where
were kept a great quantity of Bacon for the Great
Duke's Provision, they perceived, at some distance,
a Monk with a Sack upon his back coming towards
them, as if he carried a very great Burthen, and com∣ing
near to them, they asked him what made him
thus blow and be all in a sweat? He to told them,
that he had made all the haste he could, to come
to quench the Flames' that if they would but lend
him a helping Hand, to throw the Body (which he
shew'd them) of the cursed <HI>Plessou</HI> into the Fire,
they should soon see the Flame lose its force. The
Strangers having refused to comply with his desire,
which they looked upon as ridiculous, he heap'd
upon them a thousand Curses, till some <HI>Muscovites</HI>
upon his perswasions, were prevailed upon to do
him the good Office, and to help him to cast the
the dead Carcass into the Fire, which in an instant
began to abate, and in two hours after, was quite
extinguish'd; more by the assistance of those who
being encourag'd by the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk, and came from all
Parts to the quenching of the Flames, than by the
Charms of the Superstitious Fryar.</P>
<P>Those in the Castle-having thus weathered the
Storm that threatned them, the following days were
taken up in Consultations how to continue this Calm
among the People, and by which means to preserve
<HI>Morosou</HI> from falling into their Hands: For which
reason, the Patriarch having sent for those among
the Priests and Monks, whom he knew to be of
most Authority among the Populace of the City
of <HI>Musco;</HI> they were enjoin'd to do their utmost
in endeavouring the Settlement of the unquiet Spi∣rits,
<PB N="182" REF="232"/>
by their Spiritual Exhortations, and to repre∣sent
to them in the most passionate manner that
could be, the Respect and Obedience due to their
Sovereign. The Great Duke having also taken off
the New Imposition upon Salt, and Promised to
suppress all Monopolies lately set up by his Ministers,
supply'd the Places of the Executed <HI>Trochanistou</HI>
and <HI>Plessou,</HI> the first by the Boyar <HI>Knez Jurgi Alexio∣vits
Dolgaruskoi,</HI> the second with the <HI>Ocolnits Za
Bogdan Matth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovits Chitrou,</HI> both Persons of great
Ability, and approved Probity. He Treated the
<HI>Strelits</HI> with Strong Waters and Hydromel, and
caused <HI>Ilia Danilovits,</HI> his Father-in-law, to invite
the Chief Citizens of the several Professions in
the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> who were very splendidly and
kindly Entertained at his Palace for several days
together.</P>
<P>Having thus prepared his way, he took the op∣portunity
of a Procession, when being accompani∣ed
with the same <HI>Nikita Ivanovits Romanow,</HI> who
had been so successful before in appeasing the Tu∣mult,
and now rid by his left side, he spoke to the
People, and told them, That he had been extreamly
troubled to understand the Violences and Injuries
committed by <HI>Trochanistou</HI> and <HI>Plessou,</HI> upon his
good Subjects, whose welfare was very dear to him;
that those Extortions executed under his Name and
Authority, had been quite contrary to his Inclina∣tions
and Commands: And that therefore having
let them suffer condign Punishment for their Vil∣lanies,
he had put in their Places Persons of known
Integrity and Ability, whom he believed would be
acceptable to the People, as knowing them to be
Persons, that would execute Justice without Cor∣ruption
or Partiality. That he had already abolished
the New Imposition upon Salt, and would take
care, that all Monopolies newly introduced by his
Ministers, should be suppress'd; That he for the
future, would himself keep a watchful Eye over
their Actions, and not suffer their Priviledges to be
diminished, but rather, it occasion were, would
see them augm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="232"/>
The Populace being overjoy'd at this inveigling
Speech of the Great Duke, shew'd the most p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣found
respect they were capable of, by smiting
their Foreheads on the ground, and giving him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the imaginable Thanks and Promises of their future
Fidelity; so that the Czar thinking this a fit oppor∣tunity
to declare his Sentiments concerning <HI>Moro∣sou,</HI>
he reassumed the Discourse, telling them, That
he was not forgetful of what he had promised them
sometime before concerning <HI>Boris Ivanovits Morosou,</HI>
and that he was obliged to confess, that he had
transacted many things, which he would not in
any wise justifie; but that on the other Hand, he
had so much confidence in his good People, as to
hope they would excuse him,. if at this time he
could not immediately resolve to condemn him to
Death. That this being his first Request, he lived
in hopes they would not deny it him, which was,
that for once they would pardon the past Miscar∣riages
of <HI>Morosou,</HI> on whom he desired them to
look as one who had been the Guardian of their
Prince, and had Married the Great Dutchess's Sister,
who upon this double account must needs be very
dear to him, and consequently that it would be the
hardest thing in the World, for him to consent to his
Death. That he himself would be answerable for
his future Good Behaviour, not questioning but
that he would behave himself so as that they should
not have the least reason to complain of him; and,
that if they would declare him incapable by their
unanimous Vote, of being admitted into his Coun∣cel
for the future, he should be dismiss'd.</P>
<P>The Great Duke being then not twenty Years of
Age, and of a very tender Constitution, could not
forbear to accompany his last words with some
Tears, which so moved the People, that they cried
out with one Voice, <HI>Long live our Great Duke, God
grant him a long and happy Reign, God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and the Great
Duke's Will be done.</HI> The Czar having given them
his Thanks, and extolled their Zeal and Affection
for his Person, returned to the Castle well satisfied
<PB N="184" REF="233"/>
in having been so successful, to reconcile his Bro∣ther-in-law
to the Citizens of his Imperial City of
<HI>Musco.</HI></P>
<P>Some days after, the Great Duke according to
Custom, went a Pilgrimage to the Monastry of
<HI>Troitza,</HI> about Threescore Miles from <HI>Musco,</HI> when
<HI>Morosou</HI> took this opportunity of appearing again the
first time in Publick. As he went through the City
he was uncovered, Saluting the People on both sides
of the way with great Submission. He countenan∣ced
the Old Nobility for some time, and ever after
laid hold on all occasions to gratifie the People, and
assist those who Address'd themselves to him in any
Business they had at Court; so that in a little time
there appear'd a great change in the Affairs of the
Government of <HI>Muscovy;</HI> and <HI>Morosou</HI> became the
Favourite of the People, and the Patron to all
Strangers, maintaining his Greatness till his Old
Age, when he died much lamented by the People, but
not the Nobility; and as much beloved by his Prince
as he had been always successful in his Counsels.</P>
<P>But to return where we left off, notwithstanding
this Remarkable Alteration in the Government,
there hapned not long after another Revolt, which,
if it had not been timely prevented by the vigilan∣cy
of those at the Helm, might have proved of
dangerous Consequence to the Empire, which was
occasioned thus:</P>
<P>Some differences were arisen betwixt the two
Crowns of <HI>Muscovy</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> by reason that the
Subjects of both Kingdom, leaving their Habita∣tions
in their Respective Native Countries, used to
seek for shelter in the others Dominions, to avoid
the Payment of their Debts. These differences im∣proved
by some Reasons of State were risen to that
height, that both States seem'd to be threatned with
an inevitable War, unless prevented by a speedy
Composition: In order to which the Great Duke
<HI>Alexis Michaelovits</HI> sent in the Year 1649. (the next
following after the Insurrection in the City of <HI>Mus∣co)</HI>
a Solemn Ambassy to <HI>Christina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="233"/>
the Chief whereof was a certain <HI>Ocolnitza</HI> called
<HI>Bonis Ivanovits Puskia.</HI> And in regard that it was
32 Years since the Accounts had been cleared be∣twixt
the two Nations, it was Agreed by certain
Articles made at that time, That for the first Thirty
Years there should be a Liquidation of all Accounts;
but that in regard there were more <HI>Swedes</HI> now in
<HI>Muscovy</HI> than there were <HI>Muscovites</HI> in <HI>Sweden,</HI> by
which the first remain'd considerably Indebted to
the last; the Great Duke should pay to the Crown
of <HI>Sweden</HI> 190000 Rubles, which amounts to Nine∣ty
odd Thousand Pounds Sterling of <HI>English</HI> Mo∣ney;
whereof 300000 Crowns were to be paid in
ready Cash, and the rest in Rye; and the whole
Payment to be at the beginning of the next follow∣ing
Year, which was but a few Months after the
Conclusion of the Treatise.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Agreement, the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI>
had sent one <HI>John Rhodes</HI> in Quality of her Commis∣sioner
into <HI>Muscovy,</HI> who received the above-named
300000 Crowns in Ducats, and as to what related
to the Rye, he was ordered to receive it from one
<HI>Fedor Amilianou,</HI> a <HI>Muscovian</HI> Merchant in the City
of <HI>Pleskou.</HI></P>
<P>This Merchant having been Impowered by the
Great Duke to buy up thereabouts so much Rye for
his Use as would answer the remaining part of the
Debt, which amounted to 90000 Crowns, made
use of this opportunity to enrich himself at the cost
of his poor fellow Subjects. For having, under the
Cover of the Great Duke's Authority, caus'd all
the Rye thereabouts to be seis'd, and not permitting
any body either to buy or to sell any without his
leave, he Engrossed the whole Commodity for his
own use, selling it at his own Rate, which was so
excessive, that a great many poor people were
droven to the greatest extremity for want of it.
The Inhabitants of <HI>Pleskoa,</HI> as they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y

exclaiming against <HI>Puskin</HI> the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Ambas∣sador
in <HI>Sweden,</HI> whom they charged with Prevari∣cation
in his Employment, and Perfideousness to his
Prince. They did not spare <HI>Morosou,</HI> who they
said, preferred the Interest of Strangers before the
Welfare of the Natives.</P>
<P>They were not wanting to draw the City of <HI>No∣vogorod
Veliki,</HI> and other adjacent Parts into their Par∣ty,
and being perswaded that this Negotiation had
been carried on without the Knowledge, and con∣trary
to the Intention of the Great Duke, every
thing seem'd to tend to a general Insurrection in
those parts, if the Weywode or Governour of <HI>No∣vogorod</HI>
by his prudent Conduct, had not kept those
under his Jurisdiction in Obedience; yet could not
hinder their taking a Resolution to stop the Money
as it should come their way, in order to be carried
into <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>Those of <HI>Pleskou</HI> absolutely refus'd, that such a
quantity of Rye, the transportation of which, in all
likelihood must starve them, should be exported
into <HI>Sweden.</HI> And the better to be satisfied whether
the said Treaty was set on foot and executed by the
Great Duke's Order, they sent three Deputies of
their own to Court, <HI>to wit,</HI> a Merchant of that
City, a <HI>Cosack</HI> and a <HI>Strelits,</HI> to inform themselves
concerning the truth of the matter, and to desire
Redress of their Grievances: But they were no
sooner arrived at <HI>Novogorod,</HI> but the Weywode of
that City caused them to be clapt in Irons, and thus
Fetter'd, sent them to Court, where at the same
time arrived the Weywode of <HI>Pleskou,</HI> and the
Merchant <HI>Amilianou,</HI> who had been forced to quit
the City for fear of the Populace.</P>
<P>For, the first having endeavoured to prevent those
Disorders which were daily committed by the Mob,
they forced him with his Guards out of the Town,
and <HI>Amilianou,</HI> not thinking himself safe without
the Governour's assistance, accompanied him to the
City of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sco</HI> to make his Complaints to the Great
Duke.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="234"/>
Nor was he mistaken in his Judgment; for no
sooner had he left the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> but the Citizens of
<HI>Pleskou,</HI> without expecting the Return of their De∣puties,
or before they had the least Notice of the
Treatment, they had receiv'd at <HI>Novogorod,</HI> ransack'd
<HI>Amilianus</HI>'s House, and tortured his Wife in a most
cruel and barbarous manner, to make her confess
where her Husband had hid his Money. The same
Game they plaid with several <HI>Swedish</HI> Merchants
living among them, whom they robb'd, plunder'd,
and abus'd in their Persons. This done, they pub∣lished
their Manifesto against Monopolies and Pa∣tentees,
inviting the Neighbouring Cities to join
with them in the Defence of their Privileges▪</P>
<P>The Court having soon received Intelligence of
these Insolencies, they were not a little surprized
especially when they got notice that this mutinous
Spirit began to spread it self in some of the other
Cities in the Northern Provinces bordering upon
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and thinking it therefore most advisable
to try whether by gentle Means they could suppress
and prevent any further Tumults, it was resolved
to send back the Weywode of <HI>Pleskou,</HI> and with him
a Boyar, who in the Great Duke's Name should
endeavour to quiet those restless Spirits.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Plesko</HI> were for a considerable time de∣bating
whether they should open their Gates to
them or not, but the first being at last resolved up∣on,
they gave them Admittance, but it was to put
the Weywode in Prison, and to affront the Boyar,
who having spoken to them in the Great Duke's
Name, with more Authority than they thought
becoming him in his present Station, they fell upon
him with Cudgels and beat him so severely, that he
was fain to seek for Refuge in a Monastery, where
he laid for some time half dead, every one despai∣ring
of his Recovery.</P>
<P>The Great Duke having received Info<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mation in
what manner his Ministers had been treated by the
<HI>Pleskovites,</HI> who had shut their Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and put them∣selve
in a po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure of defence; and fearing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot
<PB N="188" REF="235"/>
without reason, that some of the neighbouring
Cities, encouraged by their Example, might tread
their Footsteps, if by a severe Chastisement they
were not deterr'd from such like Undertakings a∣gainst
his Authority for the future, it was resolved
to prosecute the rebellious <HI>Pleskovites</HI> with the ut∣most
Rigour. In order to which, the Great Duke
commanded <HI>Ivan Nikitovits Gavenski</HI> to assemble
the Nobility and standing Militia of the neighbou∣ring
Provinces, and to join with them several Re∣giments
of the foreign Forces commanded by the
Collonels <HI>Kormichel, Hamilton</HI> and others, to be∣siege
the City of <HI>Pleskou,</HI> and not to stir from thence
till they had reduced it to Obedience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plesko <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sieged.</HI></NOTE> The Inha∣bitants
at first seemed not at all startled at this Re∣solution,
and were so far from making their Sub∣mission
to their Prince, that they resolved unani∣mously
to stand it out to the last, and accordingly
put themselves and their City in a posture of De∣fence.
They shewed at the first approach of the
Czar's Army, no less Bravery than they had shew∣ed
Resolution in their Counsels; For they made
several furious Sallies upon the Besiegers with such
Success that they found themselves obliged to make
use of their heavy Cannon, which having made a
large Breach in their Works, their Hearts and
Strength began to fail them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is reduced.</NOTE> so that they were
forced to surrender at Discretion.</P>
<P>The Czar being resolved by an exemplary Pu∣nishment
to deter the rest of his Subjects from
committing such Outrages, caused the Ring∣leaders
of this Sedition to be tortured and put to
death, some at <HI>Pleskou,</HI> some in the adjacent Cities,
some in their City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and a great many of the
<HI>Pleskovites</HI> were banished into <HI>Siberia,</HI> where these
State-Reformators were employed in Sable-Hunting.
All things being thus qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eted by the Vigilancy of
the Great Duke, he pursued the Execution of the
Treaty made with the Crown of <HI>Sweden;</HI> And the
Rye in those Northern Parts having been by the
Fury of the Populace for the most part either de∣stroyed
<PB N="189" REF="235"/>
or consumed, so that it was impossible to
bring together a sufficient Quantity within the time
limited by the Treaty, he paid the <HI>Swedish</HI> Com∣missioner
Money instead of Rye, and caused him
under a sufficient Guard of <HI>Strelits</HI> (to protect
him against the Insolencies of the Rabble) to
be conducted to the Frontiers of the Kingdom of
<HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>These Disorders having been▪ thus appeased by
the Prudence of his Czarish Majesty, yet caused no
small Change in the Government of <HI>Muscovy.</HI> For
the Great Duke, having been made sensible of the
Miscarriages of those who being the Creatures of
<HI>Morosou</HI> and <HI>Miloslauski,</HI> had abused their Authori∣ty
to the detriment of the People, removed them
out of all Places of Trust. And as to <HI>Miloslauski</HI>
and <HI>Morosou,</HI> tho' by reason of their near Alliance
to the Great Duke, they retained much Credit at
Court; and <HI>Morosou</HI> especially, discharg'd his Trust
ever after with a great d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al of Prudence and Fi∣delity;
yet the Czar did distribute his Favours
with a more equal Hand among the other Knez
and Boyars, who had a great share in all publick
Affairs, and executed their Charges every one ac∣cording
to his Birth and Employment.</P>
<P>For which Reason he caused Knez <HI>Boris Alexan∣drovits
Rappenin,</HI> and Knez <HI>Fedor Simonovits Cura∣kin,</HI>
(whom we mentioned before to have been
sent by <HI>Morosou</HI> to the Governments of <HI>Nisi-Novo∣gorod</HI>
and <HI>Casan)</HI> to be called to Court where in
Conjunction with Knez <HI>Juan Andreovits Galitzin,
Boris Nikita Ivanovits Romanow,</HI> the Czar's Great
Uncle, they were consulted with in all Affairs of
Moment, and remained in great Authority with
this Prince, who had always a watchful Eye over
his Ministers, lest they should under the Cloak of
his Authority impose upon his Subjects.</P>
<P>For which Reason he would frequently in the
Night Season go about and Visit his Chancellours
and other Judges Desks to see what Decrrees were
pass'd, and what Petitions were laid by unanswer'd.
<PB N="190" REF="236"/>
He employed his Spies in every Corner, so that
there was scarce any Feast, great Meeting, Burial,
or Wedding of Note, but he knew all what was
transacted there. He entertained a good Number
of Gentlemen of small Fortunes, who absolutely
depending on his Favour, were sent as Spies with
the Ambassadors, and into the Armies, to attend
and watch their Motions▪ and to give a true Acount
of all their Transactions.</P>
<P>If he found any of his Officers deficient in their
Trust, he was sure not to escape Punishment; as
it happened to <HI>Peter Solticove</HI> a <HI>Muscovian</HI> Lord,
and Governour of <HI>Russia minor.</HI> This <HI>Solticove</HI> u∣sed
to keep the Arrears of the Soldiery in his Hands
to improve it to his Advantage by Merchandising
and otherwise. A certain <HI>Russian</HI> Captain, a Native of
that Province, having been kept without Pay three
whole Years, and in vain addressed himself to the
Governour, took the Opportunity of the Czar's
going into the Country to take his Pleasure (at
what time no body is permitted to interrupt▪
his Divertisements) and thronging too near the
Czar's Coach with a Petition in his Hands he suspe∣cting
him to be an Assassin, with his Staff (which was
piked at the End not unlike a Dart) intending to
make him withdraw at a farther Distance, struck
the Fellow to the Heart, so that he died imme∣diately.</P>
<P>Those that attended the Czar's Person being sur∣prized
at the Accident, and judging no otherwise
than that he intended to have made an Attempt o∣gainst
the Great Duke's Life, rid up to the Coach
and searching what Arms he had about him,
found nothing but a wooden Spoon, and the Peti∣tion
for his Arrears. The Czar shewed a great
Concern for this Mishap, and sending immediately
to <HI>Solticove</HI> the Governour of that Province, he
checked him severely, telling him that he was
guity of the Blood of this innocent Person, and
that he deserved to receive the same Treatment;
That however he would spare his Life for this time,
<PB N="191" REF="236"/>
but that he discharged him from his Commission,
ordering him not to appear for the future at Court,
and appointing <HI>Nashockin</HI> then his premier Minister
to succeed him in that Office, and to search into the
past Misdemeanours thereof, in order to redress
the Grievances of his Subjects.</P>
<P>For, it is to be observ'd, that after the Death of <HI>Moro∣rosou
Ilia Danielovits Miloslauski,</HI> the Great Duke's Fa∣ther
in Law <HI>Nashockin</HI> succeeded him in the Place of
Chief Minister of State and all his other Employments.
<HI>Miloslauski</HI> was a Man of a very strong Body and
goodly Aspect, bold, and of great Judgment, ra∣ther
feared than beloved by the Czar; but his In∣terest
was upheld by his Daughter. It is related of
him, that he had so prodigeous a Memory, as to
have perfectly well known all the the Commission
Officers of an Army of a Hundred Thousand Men,
(of which he was Generalissimo) where they Quar∣tered,
and what their Qualifications were. He was
also Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and had se∣veral
other Offices bestowed upon him, all which
he managed with great dexterity. Tho' he was
pretty well advanced in Years, he was a great Ad∣mirer
of the fair Sex, and for his Satisfaction enter∣tained
a good Number of very handsom <HI>Polish</HI> and
<HI>Tartarian</HI> Female-Slaves. His eager pursuit after
amorous Pleasures had almost lost him the Czar's
Favour; as an Apoplexy disabled him at last in
Body and Mind, so as to know no Body without
being told.</P>
<P>He was succeded in his high Employments, by
the just now mentioned <HI>Nashockin,</HI> who was also
made Chancellor of the Ambassadors Office, and
Governour of <HI>Russia Minor.</HI> He was a Person of
more than ordinary Integrity, not to be corrupted
by Presents or other Illegal means; very sober and
indefatigable in Business. The first proofs of his
great Capacity he gave at the Conclusion of the
Peace betwixt the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> to the no
small advantage of the first, which was absolutely
transacted by his Vigilancy and Conduct; as was also
<PB N="192" REF="237"/>
the League betwixt the Great Duke and <HI>Swedeland.</HI>
It was he that settled the Silk Trade upon a good
Foundation through <HI>Russia,</HI> and shew'd them the
way, how the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade might be drawn that
way. He Reform'd and new Modell'd the <HI>Russia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Laws all over the Empire, so that Suits should be
less dilatory, and Criminals to be Examined and
Judged by the Governours of the Provinces with
their Assistants; whereas most of the Criminals
were before that time brought to <HI>Musco,</HI> with no
less Trouble to the Prisoners than Charge to the
Czar. He was a great Admirer of Monarchy, and
a Patron of the <HI>English;</HI> as on the other hand, <HI>Bog∣dan
Matfeilt</HI> always was a secret Enemy both to
<HI>Nashockin</HI> and the <HI>English,</HI> but a great Friend of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> who used to purchase his Favour by great
Presents.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bogdan</HI> was bred up with the Czar from a
Child, and was much of the same Age. He was Lord
High Sreward of the Houshold, having in his dis∣posal
all Domestick Affairs. He used to be called
the Whispering Favourite, because the Czar asked
his Advice oftner in his Closet than at the Councel-Board.
It was by his Connivance that the <HI>Jews</HI> got
secretly footing in that Court and the City of <HI>Mus∣co;</HI>
whereas before that time they were abominable
to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> because they supplied him with
handsom young Slaves out of <HI>Poland,</HI> which he
entertaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for his Pleasure, some in the Country,
and some in his Palace in <HI>Musco.</HI> His Lady being Jea∣lous
of these Slaves, shew'd her Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entment at se∣veral
times in so outragious a manner, that her Death
being resolved on, she was one Night Poysoned in a
Plate of Sweet-meats; or as others will have it,
in a Glass of Wine.</P>
<P>As for the Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovits</HI> himself, he
was a Person of a Majestick Deportment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cha∣racter of <HI>Alexis Mi∣chaelovits▪</HI></NOTE> Tall, in∣cling
to Fat, of a Sanguine Complexion, and Light
Brown Hair, Beautiful and Charitable, but severe
in his Anger; of a very strong Memory, strict in
his Devotion, and a great Favourer of his Religion,
<PB N="193" REF="237"/>
in the Observance of which, he was the strictest
Man in the World. For he never missed Divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Service; and if indisposed, used to have it per∣formed
in his Bed-Chamber. On Fast-days he
would frequent Mid-night Prayers, standing four
or five hours together prostrating himself to the
Ground. During the great Fasts, he would eat but
three Meals a Week, being contented for the rest,
with a piece of Brown Bread and Salt, a pickled
Mushroon or Cucumber, and a Cup of Quas, or
small Mead. In short, it has been observed of him,
that no Monk was ever more observant of the Ca∣nonical
hours, than he of Fasts; it having been
computed, that he fasted above Eight Months in
the Year. He would also frequently appear at the
Processions bare-headed and on foot, and was al∣ways
a declared Patron of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Church;
notwithstanding which, he would sometimes make
bold with the Church Revenue upon Loan, in
time of War, which he was not very careful to re∣pay,
knowing that the Church Treasury, which is
supplied out of the best part of the Empire, may now
and then dispense with a Loss for the benefit of the
Publick. He also made an Ordinance to restrain
the profuse Bounty of dying Men to the Clergy;
neither would he ever suffer a Monastery to be
Founded without his License.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Good-Friday</HI> he used to visit in the Night
all the Prisons in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> to take Perso∣nal
Cognisance of all the Prisoners; among whom
he would buy out some that were in Debt, and
release others that were Criminals; and bestow
sometimes great Summs for the use of such as he
knew to be really necessitated. He would cause
the Empress to do the same, and to redeem yearly
a certain number of Women out of Prison. He
ordered also at about seven or eight Miles distance
from the Imperial City, Work-Houses to be built
for Hemp and Flax, in that good Order, Beauty
and Capacity, that they were sufficient to Employ
all the poor in the Kingdom with Work; having
<PB N="194" REF="238"/>
settled for that use a good many Miles of waste
Lands, by which he improved the Manufactury of
the Country, and fed his Labourers at a very
cheap rate. He Assign'd that part of the Building
where the Women were Employ'd, for the Use
and Profit of the Empress. He was of so mild a Tem∣per,
that he seldom condemned any to Death, but
most commonly to the Strapado and Banishment
into <HI>Siberia.</HI> Being one time urg'd by some of
his Foreign Officers, to make it Death for any Man
to Desert his Colours; he answered them, <HI>That he
thought that would be too hard upon the poor Soldiers,
since it was certain that God had not given every Man
an equal share of Courage.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding these his Mild and Charitable
Inclinations, he was of a Warlike Spirit, having
been Engag'd in Wars against the <HI>Poles, Swedes,
Crim-Tartars,</HI> and <HI>Turks.</HI> For being sufficiently
sensible of the Advantage the <HI>Poles</HI> had got during
the late Intestine Commotions in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> by ma∣king
themselves Masters of the Provinces of <HI>Severia</HI>
and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sko,</HI> in the Possession of which, they were
confirmed by Virtue of the Truce made by his Father
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chael Federovi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s▪</HI> after his Disgrace received at the
Seige of <HI>Smolensko:</HI> And the Term of the said Truce
being now expired when the <HI>Poles</HI> were Engaged
in a Mortal Quarrel with the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> he look'd up∣on
this Juncture, as the most fabourable that could
be, by the Recovery of these Provinces, to secure
his Frontiers against so Potent a Neighbour.</P>
<P>For which purpose having settled a Correspon∣dence
with <HI>Chmielniski,</HI> the then General of the <HI>Co∣sacks,</HI>
and offered them his Protection; these were
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first very successful against the <HI>Poles,</HI> of whom
they killed Ten Thousand upon the spot, and took
from them the City of <HI>Kiovia.</HI> And the <HI>Poles</HI> ha∣ving
drawn out a second time their whole Force
against them, were again miserably beaten by the
<HI>Cosacks;</HI> till at last, having committed great De∣predations
in <HI>Poland,</HI> King <HI>John Casimir</HI> was obli∣ged
to March in Person against them, who having
<PB N="195" REF="238"/>
totally routed them, they Embraced the Protection
of the Great Duke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r with the <HI>Poles.</HI></NOTE> He finding himself thus
strengthened by the accession of so considerable a
Force, did apply all his Care for the recovery of <HI>Smo∣lensko;</HI>
for which purpose having brought together
a great Army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tak∣ing of <HI>Smo∣lensko.</HI></NOTE> and a vast Train of Artislery, he be∣sieged
the City of <HI>Smolensko</HI> in the Year 1653. and
notwithstanding the Resolute Defence of the <HI>Polish</HI>
Garrison, made himself Master of it in the Year
next following.</P>
<P>The taking of which Place was chiefly attributed
to the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> who upon all occasions gave the ut∣most
proofs of their Bravery, and Hatred against
the <HI>Poles</HI> during this Memorable Seige.</P>
<P>Having thus opened his way into <HI>Poland,</HI> he car∣ried
the Terrour of his Victorious Arms into the
Great Dutchy of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> he Ravaged the whole
Country, took many Cities; and in the Year 1655.
also the Capital City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Takes</HI> Vil∣na.</NOTE> called <HI>Vilna;</HI> where, as well
as in other places, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> committed most
horrid Barbarities, in Retaliation, as they said, of
those Calamities they had suffered by the <HI>Polish</HI> In∣vasion,
during their Intestine Commotions.</P>
<P>In the same Year <HI>Charles Gustavus</HI> King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
entered <HI>Poland</HI> with an Army of Chosen Men,
and having soon Conquered the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Lesser Po∣land,</HI>
and <HI>Mosovia,</HI> with the City of <HI>Cracovia,</HI>
Marched from thence into <HI>Prussia,</HI> where he was re∣ceived
by most of the Cities, except <HI>Dantzick,</HI> who
stood firm to the Interest of King <HI>Casimir.</HI> See∣ing
his Affairs reduc'd to that Extremity, he fled
himself into <HI>Silesia</HI> for Refuge and Aid from the
Emperour; so that not only the whole standing
Militia of <HI>Poland,</HI> but also that part of <HI>Lithuania,</HI>
which was not as yet Conquered by the <HI>Muscovites,</HI>
submitted themselves to the <HI>Swedish</HI> Protection.</P>
<P>Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovits,</HI> not thinking it Advi∣sable
to Encounter the <HI>Swedes,</HI> flush'd with their
late Success, and strengthened by the whole Force
of <HI>Poland,</HI> judged it more for his Interest, to make
use of this Opportunity, whilst the <HI>Swedes</HI> were
<PB N="196" REF="239"/>
Engaged with the <HI>Poles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His War with <HI>Swe∣den.</HI></NOTE> to transfer his Arms into
<HI>Livonia,</HI> where he hoped to make a considerable
Progress in the absence of their King, <HI>Charles Gu∣stavus,</HI>
before he should be able to come to their
Relief.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Resolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Enters</HI> Li∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia.</NOTE> he entred <HI>Livonia</HI>
with a very Puissant Army, and Besieged <HI>Torpat,</HI>
which after some Resistance, he took by Compo∣sition.</P>
<P>Having soon after made himself Master of <HI>Ko∣kenhousen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is forced to Raise the Siege of <HI>Riga.</HI></NOTE>
and some other places of Note, he laid
Siege to the City of <HI>Riga,</HI> the Capital of the Pro∣vince
of <HI>Lettie</HI> in <HI>Livonia,</HI> Situate upon the River
<HI>Dune,</HI> which exonerates it self into the <HI>Baltick Sea;</HI>
but the <HI>Swedish</HI> Garrison defended the Place with so
much Galantry, that the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> notwithstan∣ding
their reiterated Attacks, were forced to Raise
the Siege with very great Loss.</P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Poles</HI> having recollected
themselves, after their first Consternation, had De∣feated
and Dispersed the <HI>Swedes</HI> that were Quarter∣ed
up and down the Country; had Retaken <HI>Warso∣via,</HI>
and the Revolted <HI>Lithuanians,</HI> had Surprised
and Killed all the <HI>Swedes</HI> that were in Winter Quar∣ters
with them.</P>
<P>And tho' <HI>Charles Gustavus</HI> the <HI>Swedish</HI> King (hav∣ing
been joined before by the Elector of <HI>Branden∣burgh</HI>'s
Forces) did Vanquish the <HI>Poles</HI> in a Memo∣rable
Battle, which lasted Three Days near <HI>Warso∣via;</HI>
yet being soon after obliged to March out of
<HI>Poland</HI> against the <HI>Danes,</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> Retook <HI>Cracovia</HI>
and <HI>Thorn</HI> from the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and Recovered <HI>Cour∣land</HI>
out of their Hands.</P>
<P>At last both Crowns being Tired with the War,
a Treaty of Peace was set on foot in the Year 1666.
in the Monastry of <HI>Oliva</HI> near the City of <HI>Dantzick,</HI>
in the Royal <HI>Prussia;</HI> so that Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelo∣vits</HI>
fearing not without Reason, that after the
Peace was Concluded betwixt both those Potent
Kingdoms, they might turn their United Forces a∣gainst
him, proposed to be included in the said Trea∣ty;
<PB N="197" REF="239"/>
by Virtue of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peacemale at <HI>Oliva.</HI></NOTE> both the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI>
Resigned their Pretensions upon <HI>Livonia</HI> to the
<HI>Swedes;</HI> but the first were Confirm'd in the Posses∣sion
of <HI>Smolensko, Severia</HI> and <HI>Kiovia,</HI> which was
given them by the <HI>Poles</HI> as an Equivalent of what
they lost in <HI>Livonia.</HI> In lieu of which, the <HI>Swedes</HI>
restored to the <HI>Poles</HI> all the places they were posses∣sed
of in the Royal <HI>Prussia,</HI> and the later Resign'd
the whole Sovereignty over the Ducal <HI>Prussia</HI> to
the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh.</HI> This Peace proved
very Advantagious to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who by the
Recovery of these Frontier Provinces, secured
themselves against the further Attempts of a most
Potent Neighbour.</P>
<P>The War he was engaged in against the <HI>Turks</HI>
and <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His War <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE> was occasioned because some of
the <HI>Zaporogian Cosacks</HI> had submited themselves
under his Protection (as we mentioned before)
whereas some of them had sought for Protection
under the Grand Seignior, which occasioned a
War betwixt these two potent Neighbours, in
which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> got but little Advantage; For
the <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> made an Irruption into <HI>Musco∣vy,</HI>
and carried away above 400000 Souls into per∣petual
Captivity.</P>
<P>There had some years before also been swept a∣way
by the Plague betwixt seven and eight Hun∣dred
thousand People, and a great Number of Men
had been lost in the War with the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Swedes;</HI>
So that betwixt the Sword and Plague, it was
computed that <HI>Muscovy</HI> had in Ten years time lost
near a Million and a half of People, which so im∣poverished
and depopulated the Country, that a∣bundance
of the best Land lay untilled for want
of Hands, and that in some of the Southern Parts,
where the <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> had made their Inroads,
there was scarce any thing to be seen but Women
and Children; Since which time however the <HI>Rus∣sian</HI>
Empire has in a great measure recovered its
pristine Prosperity.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="240"/>
In the Year 1669,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Re∣bellion.</NOTE> <HI>Muscovy</HI> was involved in ano∣ther
Rebellion raised by one <HI>Stephen Ratzin.</HI></P>
<P>He was a <HI>Dunensian Cosack</HI> by Birth, and having
observed a certain Disposition in the <HI>Nagaian Tar∣tars,</HI>
inhabiting the Kingdom of <HI>Casan</HI> and <HI>Astra∣chan,</HI>
by Reason of the heavy Oppressions they
groaned under, by the Mismanagement and Ava∣rice
of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Governours in those Parts,
to shake off the <HI>Russian</HI> Yoak, he gathered a consi∣derable
Party, and being assisted by a good Num∣ber
of his Fellow <HI>Cosacks</HI> inhabiting betwixt the
<HI>Dun</HI> and the <HI>Wolga,</HI> he marched at the Head of
them to besiege the City of <HI>Astrachan,</HI> which, after
some small Resistance, was surrendred into his
Hands. From thence he marched towards <HI>Casan,</HI>
threatning not only that City, but also the Southern
<HI>Muscovy</HI> with a most dreadful Invasion, his Army
increasing prodigiously by the vast Number of <HI>Tar∣tars</HI>
that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock'd in to his Assistance.</P>
<P>But instead of improving this Opportunity to
his Advantage, he gave himself to Idleness and all
manner of Debauchery, whereby the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
having got Leisure to draw together their Forces to
stop the Current of his Victories, They were so
expeditious as to arrive near <HI>Casan,</HI> before <HI>Ratzin</HI>
could lay Siege to the Place, and having thus cut
off all Communication with the Country there∣abouts,
from whence <HI>Astrachan</HI> and the adjacent
Parts are supplied with Corn, the rebellious Army
was soon reduced to great Straights for want of
P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovisions; so that the <HI>Tartars,</HI> being apprehensive
of their approaching Danger, left their Leader for
the most part.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, the <HI>Cosacks</HI> stood it out
bravely, resolving to maintain their Ground against
the <HI>Muscovites.</HI> For which purpose they having
entrenched themselves under the Walls of <HI>Astra∣chan,</HI>
The <HI>Muscovites</HI> seeing the desperate Resolu∣tion
of the <HI>Cosacks,</HI> thought it most advisable to
reduce them, if possible, to Obedience, rather by
fair Means, (and a promise of Pardon for what was
<PB N="199" REF="240"/>
past than by force of Arms. This had the desi∣red
Effect: For <HI>Ratzin,</HI> finding his <HI>Cosacks</HI> waver∣ing,
upon the Perswasions of some of his Friends
in the Czar's Court (who gave him great Hopes of
his Pardon) surrendred himself to the Mercy of
Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovits</HI> in the next following
Year.</P>
<P>His Party being thus deprived of their Head,
readily embraced the Czar's Offers; but <HI>Ratzin</HI>
himself, not long after, found himself extreamly
mistaken in his Hopes; for he was carried to the
great Market-place before the Castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ratzin <HI>be∣headed.</HI></NOTE> where he had
first his Arms and Legs, and afterwards his Head
cut off in the Presence of an infinite Number of
People, who flocked thither to be Spectators of the
tragical Exit of him, whom not many Month be∣fore
they had looked upon as their most dreadful
Enemy.</P>
<P>About the same time <HI>Maria</HI> the Empress Regent
departed this Life, and Czar <HI>Alexis Michaelovits</HI>
was married soon after to another young Lady,
the Niece of <HI>Oatomon Sergoivits,</HI> who having
by this near Alliance with the Emperor ob∣tained
the whole Ministry of the Government,
acquired himself with great Applause and to the
General Satisfaction of the People in this emi∣nent
Station, till the year 1675. When Czar <HI>A∣lexis
Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haelovits</HI> died,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Czar</HI> A∣lexis Mi∣chaelovits <HI>dies.</HI></NOTE> to the great Regret of his
Subjects, who by Reason of his great Clemency,
singular Devotion, and incomparable Conduct du∣ring

<P>He left behind him, by the first Adventure, two

Reflections on the present State of Mus∣covy,

<P>AFTER the Death of <HI>Fedor Alexiovits, John</HI>
the second Son of <HI>Alexis Michaelovits</HI> being,
by Reason of his natural Infirmities, incapable of
undertaking the Administration of the Government,
was soon prevailed upon to resign all his Claim to
the <HI>Russian</HI> Crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Fac∣tions after his Death.</NOTE> to his younger Brother <HI>Peter,</HI>
who, tho' very young, being looked upon by most
of the Boyars as the only Person who gave them all
the imaginable Hopes of his future Ability to sup∣ply

crowned Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> instead of the deceased

the Minority of her Brother <HI>Fedor,</HI> she with
<PB N="201" REF="241"/>
Knez <HI>Gailizin</HI> and some others of her Creatures
took a Resolution not to part with so fine a Morsel
at so easie a Rate, but to endeavour, by putting
<HI>John</HI> in the Throne, to maintain their own Great∣ness,
in Opposition to the New Czar <HI>Peter Alexio∣vits.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed, that the deceased Empress
<HI>Maria,</HI> Mother to <HI>John,</HI> who had by his own Con∣sent
debarred himself from the Royal Dignity, was
infinitely beloved by the Common People, by reason
of her extraordinary Modesty, Charity, and o∣ther
most eminent Vertues; The Princess being
not ignorant of this Advantage on her side, sent
abroad her Emissaries, who insinuated into
the People the Injustice done to <HI>John</HI> the eldest
surviving Son of the Empress <HI>Maria,</HI> the Darling
of the People, by an adverse Party, who con∣trary
to the antient established Custom of <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
had excluded that Prince from his Right in
favour of his younger Brother.</P>
<P>These cunning Informations had such powerful
Influence over the Common people, but especially
over the Guards that constantly attend the Czar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
Person, that one Morning being headed by some of
the Princesses Creatures, they rose in open Rebel∣lion,
declaring, they would not lay down their

the Mutiny, did feel the dreadful Effects of their
Fury; for some had their Palaces ransack'd and
pull'd down to the ground, others were cut to
pleces immediately, others thrown out of the Win∣dows;
so that nothing less than a total Destruction
seem'd to threaten the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> unless pre∣vented
by some Expedient, which might stay the
Fury of the enraged Populace. For which reason,
the Heads of both Factions (who by this time be∣gan
equally to dread the Insolency of the Rabble)
after various Debates, came to this following Re∣solution:
<PB N="202" REF="242"/>
That, to ballance▪ the▪ Interest of both
contending Parties, Czar <HI>Peter</HI> should be confirm∣ed
in the Throne of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but that his elder
Brother <HI>John</HI> should be his Associate, both in the
Royal Dignity and Administration of the Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>The Princess <HI>Sophia,</HI> having thus once more by
the powerful Influence she had over the weakness
of her Brother <HI>John,</HI> and by reason of the tender
Age of the present Czar <HI>Peter</HI> che being not above
twelve years of Age, when he was Crown'd
Czar of <HI>Muscovy)</HI> got the Reins of the Govern∣ment
into her own hands, managed all Matters
under the Conduct of the Premier Minister, Knez
<HI>Gallizin</HI> (her Creature) with a great deal of dexte∣rity
for some time, till at last by the removal of
this her faithful Councellor, being deprived of his
Assistance, and the Death of her own Brother,
Czar <HI>John</HI> (who died about four years ago without
Issue) she was totally excluded from the fur∣ther
Management of publick Affairs, and thrust
into a Monastery, where she is detained to this
day.</P>
<P>The present Czar <HI>Peter</HI> was born on the 29th of
<HI>May,</HI> in the Year 1670, by a second Adventure,
and after the Death of Czar <HI>Fedor</HI> his eldest Bro∣ther,
Crown'd Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> when he was not
full twelve Years of Age. After the removal of
Knez <HI>Gallizin</HI> from the Ministry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Conspi∣racy against the present <HI>Czar.</HI></NOTE> and the death of
his Brother, the whole Administration of the Go∣vernment
being devolved to him, he managed it
with so much Conduct and Success, as has rendred
his Actions famous throughout all <HI>Europe;</HI> which
those of the contrary Faction looking upon with
an envious Eye, a Design was laid some few years
ago, against his Life, which in all likelihood would
have proved fatal to this great Prince, if by the
Imprudence of him, who was to have been the
Chief Actor in this Tragedy, the whole Design had
not been discovered before the Conspirators could
<PB N="203" REF="242"/>
meet with an opportunity to put it in execu∣tion.</P>
<P>This was a <HI>German</HI> by Birth, whose name was
<HI>Sickler,</HI> who having a considerable Command in
the Czar's Army, and being extreamly beloved by
him, had a free Access to his Person. This Man
being inticed by the hopes of extraordinary Re∣wards
(even of the Crown of <HI>Muscovy)</HI> under∣took
to dispatch the Czar the first favourable Op∣portunity
that should present, and had certainly
executed his Design, if the Contests that arose a∣mong
the Conspirators concerning the Succession
in the Throne, had not delay'd the Execution
of it.</P>
<P><HI>Sickler</HI> in the mean while, who was a good Bot∣tle-Companion,
having utter'd some Words to a
Friend of his at several times, relating to their in∣tended
Project, he conceived so much a horror at it,
that he was resolved to discover, what he had heard
<HI>Sickler</HI> say concerning the Conspiracy; But know∣ing
him to be in great favour with the Czar, he was
not without reason afraid, that his Depositions
might be interpreted by the adverse Faction, as
proceeding from Envy or Malice, and consequent∣ly,
instead of serving his Prince, turn to his own
destruction, he resolved to proceed with as much
caution as possibly he could in a Matter of so much
Moment.</P>
<P>For which purpose having one day met a cer∣tain
Gentleman, an intimate Friend of his and of
<HI>Sickler;</HI> and not questioning, but that he had made
use of the same Expressions to him, in relation to
the Conspiracy, as he had heard him say at several
times in his presence; he began to enter upon a
Discourse of their common Friend <HI>Sickler,</HI> and in
a careless Manner to repeat several Passages, which
he had received from <HI>Sickler</HI>'s own Mouth. His
Friend being not a little surprised at the Imprudence
of his Friend, told him, that indeed he had heard
him say several times many things of that Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e;
<PB N="204" REF="243"/>
but looking upon them as the Effects of strong
Liquor, he never made any further account of
them. But the other replying, that the Conceal∣ment
of Matters of such a nature might one time
or another prove their Destruction; and that there∣fore,
he was fully resolved not to hide it any long∣er,
they went by joint-consent to make their Dis∣covery
to the Czar in Person.</P>
<P>He was just then at a Wedding in the Suburbs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plot disco∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red a∣gainst the <HI>Czar.</HI></NOTE>
where the <HI>Germans,</HI> and other Christian Foreigners
have their Habitations, when being informed of
the most imminent danger that threatned his Life,
he went immediately, accompany'd by his Guards,
and some of his most trusty Boyars to the House
of <HI>Sickler,</HI> and looking upon him wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a stern
Countenance, after having asked him some general
Questions, and among others; <HI>What Punishment
ought to be inflicted upon a Person who should not only
betray, but murder his Friend in cold Blood;</HI> and the
sudden Change of his Countenance and his con∣fused
Answer, sufficiently betraying the Guilt
of his Conscience, he caused him to be seised,
and being confronted with his two Friends, who
had made the Discovery, he confessed the whole
Design, and received the due reward of his
Treachery, being broken alive upon the
Wheel.</P>
<P>As to the present Czar's Person, he is of a No∣ble
Aspect, his Face being of an Oval Figure,
with very large Eyes, and well Featured; his
Hair of a light brown Colour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣on of the present <HI>Czar.</HI></NOTE> his Complexion in∣clining
to brown but very clear; he is slender but
very strong and well-set, being above six Foot
high, and tho' in his whole demeanour there appears
a great deal of Majesty; yet is his Conversation full
of an engaging Familiarity, without the least
appearance of Pride even to the meanest of his
Subjects; but his chief delight is in the Conver∣sation
of Strangers, with whom he will at cer∣tain
Times converse no otherwise than if they
<PB N="205" REF="243"/>
were his Equals, and be very frolicksome in their
Company.</P>
<P>Thus he did some Years ago in the River of <HI>Arch-Angel</HI>
with some <HI>English</HI> Merchants, and a Captain
of a Ship belonging to the <HI>Russian</HI> Company. This
Ship, called the <HI>Perry</HI> and <HI>Lane,</HI> carrying 30 Guns,
arrived in the Year 1694, in the beginning of <HI>Ju∣ly</HI>
in the River of <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> at the same time,
that the present Czar was come thither to take a
view of a new Man of War, which he had caused
to be bought for his Service in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperour having some days after, invited
himself on Board the said Captain, he came ac∣cordingly
at 3 a Clock in the Afternoon, with 40
or 50 of his Attendance, where he passed away his
Time so pleasantly, that he did not depart till next
Morning after Sun rise.</P>
<P>The next day he invited the Captain, all the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Merchants, and Masters of Ships, to dine with
him at a House in an adjacent Island, where being
seated at the same Table with the Emperour, he,
after Dinner was over, caused them all to be wet∣ed
with an Engine brought lately from <HI>Holland;</HI>
Which done, he made them all, without the least
distinction of Age or Quality, to plunge themselves
over Head and Ears into the River, he in his Per∣son
leading the Way, and shewing by his own Ex∣ample,
what they had to do.</P>
<P>Having dismissed them for that time, they
were invited again a few days after to the same
Island, where they all play'd at Nine-Pins and Bowls
till Night, when expecting the Czar's Orders to
depart, he told them that they must stay with him
till the Wind turn'd fair; so that they were forced
to stay two days and nights, during which time
they spent the days in Merriment, and a few hours
in the Nights upon the hard Boards; when the Wind
veering about, they got leave to depart, and set
Sail for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="244"/>
As he takes great delight in the Company of
Strangers, so he makes use most commonly of fo∣reign
Habits, even in his own Country; which the
present Patriarch of <HI>Muscovy</HI> looking upon as not
agreeable to their own Customs, took the opportuni∣ty,
when he met the present Czar one day at his Mo∣thers
Palace, then lying upon her Death-bed, to tell
him in her Presence, That the Czars his Predecessors
used always to endeavour to maintain the good
Will of their Subjects, by accommodating them∣selves
to their most antient Customs, and to appear
in the same Habit with their Subjects; To which
the Czar made answer: <HI>Father, are you not the Head
of the</HI> Muscovian <HI>Church; to which he having reply'd,
yes Sir, by your Favour? the Czar</HI> said, <HI>and why
then turn you the Head and Advocate of the Taylors?
I intend to give my Subjects more substantial Proofs of
the care I take for their Welfare, than what de∣pends
from the imaginary Differences of Dresses or
Cloaths.</HI></P>
<P>But a Priest of his Attendance did not come
at so cheap a Rate in the <HI>Hague;</HI> For the Czar,
having been informed, that all the Day of the
proclaiming of the Peace he got excessively drunk,
laid this Penance upon him, to wit, to be em∣ployed
in twisting of Ropes for many days to∣gether,
which having cut the poor Fellows Hand
to the Bones, gave the Priest an experimental
Proof of the Cruelties they sometimes with so
much freedom exercise upon the Laity.</P>
<P>The present Czar's Journey into those Parts at a
time when he is engaged in a heavy War against
the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Czars Journey.</NOTE> and his Presence seems to be
absolutely necessary to suppress the Designs of a
potent adverse Faction, has been the Wonder
of all <HI>Europe;</HI> But it is to be observed, that
by the seasonable Discovery of the last Conspi∣racy
by the thrusting the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> into
a Monastery, and the removal of the Knez <HI>Gal∣lizin</HI>
from the Ministry into <HI>Siberia,</HI> the Faction,
<PB N="207" REF="244"/>
that hitherto opposed his Interest, has been suf∣ficiently
discouraged from making further At∣tempts
against a Prince, who by his singular
Clemency and the great Success of his Arms
against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> is now become the Darling
of the common People.</P>
<P>Besides which, he took all the Precaution
imaginable before his Departure, to disappoint
the Designs of his Enemies, if perhaps in his
Absence they should have a mind to try their
Fortune.</P>
<P>For which Reason he not only committed
the whole Management of the Government to
such as he knew absolutely devoted to his In∣terest,
but also sent a great Number of Per∣sons
of the first Quality (the Sons of the
most Antient Nobilty) to travel into far di∣stant
Countries, to instruct themselves in the
Mathematicks, the Art of Navigation and o∣ther
useful Sciences, for a certain Term of
Years; where they might both improve their
own Knowledge to the Advantage of their Na∣tive
Country, and at the same time serve
him as Pledges of their Parents▪ Fidelity during
his Stay in foreign Countries.</P>
<P>The Motive which could induce so great a
Prince to leave for some time his Native
Country, cannot be attributed to any other
Cause than his most ardent Desire of impro∣ving
his own Knowledge and of his Subjects,
quite contrary to what has been practised by
his Predecessors, who looked upon the Ig∣norance
of their Subjects as the main Foun∣dation-Stone
of their Absolute Power; from
whence the most clear-sighted▪ promise them∣selves
great Advantages after his Return into
<HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="245"/>
Thus much is unquestionable, that his De∣sire
of improving himself in the Art of
Navigation and all Sea-Affairs, is such as to
surpass the industry of most private Men, who
apply themselves to it out of a bare Prospect
of Lucre.</P>
<P>I have heard it related by very credible Per∣sons,
that he would not only go frequently to
<HI>Sordam</HI> (a large Village on the opposite Shore
of the City of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> on the same Ri∣ver)
most inhabited by Shipwrights employed
there in the building of Ships, in Disguise,
on purpose to instruct himself in every thing
belonging to that Trade; But he used often
to go disguised in a Sea-man's Habit into the
Yard of the <HI>East-India</HI> House, where he would
be employed in fetching and carrying such
Materials as are requisite for the building of
Ships, which he would see put in their pro∣per
Places, and oftentimes would employ
himself in working in concert with the Ship∣wrights.</P>
<P>It is by this incredible Desire of accomplish∣ing
himself in this, as well as all other useful
Arts and Sciences, that he has so improved his
Judgment, as to be able to examine and in∣form
himself concerning all Matters relating to
Military Affairs, whether by Sea or Land; both
which he endeavours to improve, far beyond
whatever was attempted by any of his Prede∣cessors,
which is sufficiently apparent by the in∣tended
communication betwixt the two Rivers,
<HI>Wolga</HI> and <HI>Tanais,</HI> and the discovery of <HI>Nova
Zembla</HI> not to be an Island, as it has ben hi∣therto
believed; and the <HI>Mare Glaciale</HI> of the
Frozen Sea, to be nothing else but a <HI>Sinus</HI> or
Bay, which was performed by His Czarish Ma∣jesty's
express Orders, within these few Years.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="245"/>
And as the prosperous success of his Arms against
the <HI>Crim-Tartars</HI> seems to be a convincing instance,
that his generous endeavours have not proved
fruitless, so the design of extending his Conquest to
the Black Sea, gives the <HI>Muscovites</HI> all the hopes
imaginable; of seeeing their Empire in a few Years, a
more flourishing condition than ever it has been in
under the Reigns of their former Monarchs; of
which the great Atchievements of this brave Prince,
which are the Subject of the following relations,
seems to be the happy presages.</P>
<P>But before we go any further, it will not be be∣yond
our purpose to insert here the true character
of Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z <HI>GalliZin,</HI> together with two remarkable
Accidents, which seem'd to be the forerunners of
his ensuing downfal: which caused no small change
in the Affairs of the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Government.</P>
<P>Knez <HI>GalliZin</HI> descended from the Race of the
<HI>Jagellons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Knez <HI>GalliZin</HI></NOTE> was at that time one of the most consi∣derable
Princes of the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Empire, whe∣ther
in regard of his illustrious Extraction, or
the high Station he was settled in, of being Chief
Minister of State, by the favours of the eldest Czar
<HI>John,</HI> and his Sister <HI>Sophia,</HI> who's Creature he was.
He was undoubtedly one of the best Head pieces
in the Kingdom, and the most Knowing, and most
Accomplish'd of all the <HI>Muscovian Boyars,</HI> always
addicted to the <HI>French</HI> Interest, and such an ad∣mirer
of the present <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. that
he caused his Son to wear his Picture constantly
upon his Breast. It was chiefly owing to his ad∣vice
and dexterity, that the Princess <HI>Sophia</HI> had
seized upon the Administration of the Government
during the Minority of the two Czars, her Bro∣thers,
in which she continued for several Years; by
the extraordinary Conduct of this her faithful Mi∣nister,
till the Boyars and Chief of the Nobility,
who were altogether in the Interest of the Youngest
Czar <HI>Peter</HI> the present Emperour, being resolved
not to suffer themselves any longer to be Imposed
upon by this Favourite, found means to remove
<PB N="210" REF="246"/>
him from his Ministry, of which the two follow∣ing
relations appeared to be the Fatal Presages.</P>
<P>The first was undertaken by a private person,
who having watched his opportunity one morning
as <HI>GalliZin</HI> was going in his Sledge to the Czar's
Palace, threw himself upon him, and seized him
by the Beard to stab him. But whilst he was draw∣ing
his dagger which (according to the <HI>Muscovian</HI>
fashion) stuck in his Girdle, the Princes Servants
running up to the Sledge, had the good fortune
to stop his hand, just as he was about sticking the
Dagger in their Master's Heart.</P>
<P><HI>The Assassin was so far from being dejected, that
on the contrary his rage seemed to be encreased,
which sufficinetly appeared by his furious looks, and
his utmost, tho' vain efforts, of putting his design
in Execution; But finding himself overpowered, and
all his endeavours in vain, he spoke to</HI> GallaZin
<HI>with unparrallell'd resolution, in the following man∣ner:</HI>
Infamous Tyrant, It is not the fear of death,
but the regret I feel of being disappointed in my design,
that you see me thus changed in my Countenance; But
know, that tho' I have been so unfortunate as to fail
in this attempt, to deliver my Native Country from the
most horrid Monster that ever was bred upon the face
of the Earth; tho' this hand has been unsuccessful in
making thee a Sacrifice to the just resentments of thy
fellow Subjects; Know, I say, that this feat is reserved
for some happier hand than mine, and that among
three hundred Citizens, who, out of pity to the people,
that daily groan under the burthen of thy most intole∣rable
oppressions, have conspired thy final destruction;
there will be some, that will take surer measures than
I have done.</P>
<P>He was going on in his discourse, if he had
not been dragged away immediately to Prison,
where after having been put to the Rack, he was
executed privately, for fear of incensing the
people.</P>
<P>This Outrage was soon after followed by ano∣ther;
less dangerous in its Contrivance, but suffi∣ciently
<PB N="211" REF="246"/>
convincing to <HI>GalliZin</HI> of the Sentiments the
people had of his Ministry.</P>
<P>He was then just upon his departure for the
Army, which he was to Command, as General, a∣gainst
the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI> when one night a covered
Coffin was found at his Pallace Gate, with a Note
in it, containing these Words: <HI>GalliZin, Ʋnless
the Campaign which thou art now going to open, prove
more successful than the former, we are resolved to make
sure work with thee.</HI></P>
<P>The worst of all was, that these menaces pro∣ved
true in the Event; for, after his return from
the Army, he was so closely press'd upon by the
rest of the Boyars, that not being able to justifie
himself against the manifold miscarriages laid to
his charge, he was dismissed from all his Imploy∣ments
at Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">GalliZin banished.</NOTE> his Estate Confiscated, and he
banished into <HI>Siberia,</HI> where he was forced to lead
a miserable, or rather shameful life.</P>
<P>Much about the same time Prince <HI>Archilla,</HI> King
of <HI>Iveria</HI> and <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> who had for some Years
last past lived with his Princess in the Court of the
two Czars, was preparing for his return into his
Kingdoms. This Prince being originally a <HI>Geor∣gian</HI>
by Birth, had been prevailed upon to embrace
Mahometism, for the peaceable enjoyment of the
two Kingdoms of <HI>Iveria</HI> and <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> which bor∣der
upon <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>The Chan of <HI>Persia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Archilla.</NOTE> who's Vassal he was, and
to purchase whose favour he had changed his Re∣ligion,
was very favorable to him at first; and tho'
he not long after return'd to the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion,
which he profess'd before, did not use him with the
same severity as he did the rest of the Petty Prin∣ces,
that were his Vassals. But this seeming kind∣ness
of his, proceeded, (as it appear'd afterwards)
not so much from any inclinations he had for his
person, as the Beauty of his Princess. For having
received great recommendations of the excellency
of her Person, as he was insatiable in his Lust to
Women, so, tho' he never had seen her, he was
<PB N="212" REF="247"/>
resolved to purchase the enjoyment of so much
Beauty at any rate; so that he made this unfor∣tunate
Prince sufficiently sensible that he had no
longer any regard for his person; being now be∣come
no less troublesome to him, than he had ap∣pear'd
kind before.</P>
<P>His first endeavours were carried on by fair
means, by vast promises, and hopes of great Re∣wards,
but these proving insufficient to obtain his
desire, he proceeded from mildness to Threats,
but finding these also not to have the desired ef∣fect,
he had recourse to open Violence; order∣ing
his forces to advance into the Territories of
<HI>Archilla,</HI> to seize him and his Princess, and carry
them prisoners to his Court.</P>
<P><HI>Archilla,</HI> dreading the indignation of the Chan,
who's Forces he was not strong enough to oppose,
was obliged to seek for safety in his flight, and reti∣red
with the Princess to the utmost confines of this
Kingdom of <HI>Iveria,</HI> which being the most distant
from <HI>Persia,</HI> border upon the <HI>Turkish</HI> Territories, on
that side towards the Black Sea; in, hopes to shel∣ter
themselves there against the forces of their ene∣mies.
But the Chan of <HI>Persia</HI> resolved not to quit his
pretension at that rate, found means to engage the
<HI>Turkish Grand Seignior</HI> in his Quarrel, who having
sent some forces to seize the Prince, they surpri∣sed
and carried him to a Castle under the juris∣diction
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> on the borders of <HI>Iveria,</HI>
where he was detained Prisoner till further orders.</P>
<P>They had shewn so much favour to the Prin∣cess,
whom they were unwilling to use with violence
that they had not detained her person; But she
being exasperated to the highest degree, by the out∣rages
committed upon her husband, retired secret∣ly
into <HI>Iveria,</HI> where without any further delay,
having assembled some Gentlemen, the bravest and
most trusty among her Subjects, she, like another
<HI>Amazon,</HI> marched at the head of them to the Re∣lief
of her husband.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="247"/>
The Garrison had got some intelligence of her
approach some hours before her arrival near the
place, wherefore having prepared themselves for
a resolute defence, the <HI>Iverians</HI> met with a stout
resistance. But being encouraged by the presence
and example of their Princess, who was resolved
either to deliver her Husband, or to fall in the
attempt; they at last forced the Castle where their
Prince was kept Prisoner, in spite of all the re∣sistance
the Soldiers could make, carried him off,
and set him at Liberty.</P>
<P>So soon as they had time to reflect upon their
present condition, they were sufficiently sensible that
an act so extraordinary, and so bold, must needs
draw upon them the indignation of both these Great
Princes, their Neighbours, and that consequently they
could not tarry long with safety in their Kingdoms,
encompassed as it was, on all sides, by their ene∣mies▪
Therefore they were forced to abandon
their Subjects to the mercy of these two Potent
Neighbours, and with some of their most trusty
friends to seek for shelter in <HI>Muscovy.</HI></P>
<P>They were received with all the demonstrations
of friendship by the two Czars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Ar∣chilla</HI> ar∣rives in <HI>Muscovy.</HI></NOTE> who assign'd them
a Palace in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and during the space
of three. Years allowed them a Pension suitable to
their Quality, till their Subjects having composed
matters with the Grand Seignior, and become
weary of the <HI>Persian</HI> yoak, sollicited their return
into the Kingdoms of <HI>Iveria</HI> and <HI>Mangrelia,</HI> pro∣mising
to Sacrifice all what was dear to them for
their Interest, against the <HI>Persians</HI> their common
enemies.</P>
<P>The same Year the Youngest of the two Czars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The present Czar mar∣ries.</NOTE>
(the same who lately honoured this Kingdom with
his presence) married the Daughter of an Of∣ficer
of the Army. He was then but Eighteen
Years of Age, and a few days after the marriage
was published by the sound of the great Bell in
<HI>Musco</HI> (perhaps the finest in the World) he was
seized with the falling Sickness.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="248"/>
Those who did not know this distemper to be
Hereditary to his Family, but were sufficiently ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uainted
with those frequent misfortunes that hap∣pen
in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> to persons of a high Rank at the
time of their marriages; occasioned by the Envy
of the contending Rivals of the Female Sex, look∣ed
upon it as an effect of the Jealousie of such fa∣milies
as being by this marriage excluded from the
hopes of that Alliance they had aspired to, had let
their vengeance fall upon their young Prince.
But this accident not being attended with any
further ill Consequences, these Rumors were
soon dispersed, and the rejoycings continued to the
Great Satisfaction of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who had pla∣ced
the chief hopes of their future prosperity in the
Activity and Courage of a Prince, who soon after
gave them such evident proofs of his great abili∣ty
in the art of Government, that they were sa∣tisfied
their hopes would not fall short of their ex∣pectation,
especially when the CzaritZa within a
twelve Month after, brought forth as Young Prince,
who being now about Eight Years of Age, gives
all the imaginable hopes, of being one day the in∣heritor
of his Father's Vertues and Dominions.</P>
<P>For after the Removal of <HI>GalliZin,</HI> having ta∣ken
the Reins of the Government into his own
hands, and consequently suppres'd that Faction
which hitherto had in a measure opposed his
Greatness, he began to lay the foundation towards
the accomplishment of these designs, which within
these few Years last past have been the Admira∣tion
of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and caused Terror to his
Enemies.</P>
<P>The unfortunate War in which the <HI>Turks</HI> were en∣gaged
against the Emperour, <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> ha∣ving
sufficiently disenabled them to send any conside∣rable
Succours to the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The War a∣gainst the <HI>Crim Tar∣tars.</HI></NOTE> the hereditary E∣nemies
of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> which has so often felt the direful
effects of their barbarous Cruelties, the present jun∣cture
of time was look'd upon as the most favou∣rable
to reduce these troublesome Neighbours un∣der
<PB N="215" REF="248"/>
the Obedience of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire. For
which purpose a considerable Army having been
brought into the field, the Siege of <HI>Asaph</HI> was re∣solved
on, which, City being seated at the mouth
of the River <HI>Don</HI> or <HI>Tanais,</HI> where it discharges
itself into the <HI>Palus Meotides,</HI> or the Sea of <HI>Zabac∣çhe,</HI>
is the Inlet into the lesser <HI>Tartary,</HI> and con∣quently
facilitates the Conquest of the <HI>Crim Tar∣tars,</HI>
inhabiting the <HI>Taurica Chersonesus.</HI> The <HI>Mus∣covites</HI>
attack'd the City very vigourously, but
being destitute of Shipping, and not sufficiently
provided with good Canoneers, they could not hin∣der
the <HI>Turks</HI> from bringing in at several times fresh
supplies of Men, Ammunition and other necessa∣ries,
whereby they were obliged at the approach
of the Winter Season to raise the Siege for that
time.</P>
<P>But the Czar was so far from being discouraged
by this retreat, that he resolved to repair this dis∣grace,
and to make himself master of the place,
let it cost what it will. For which purpose having
order'd a considerable number of Ships to be built,
and mann'd, to prevent their Communication with
the Sea, and obtained a good number of Engineers,
Bombardeers, and Canoneers from the Emperour,
<HI>Venetians,</HI> Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and some other
Christian Princes; he resolved to take the field in
person in the ensuing year, so soon as the Rivers
should become Navigable, and to open the Cam∣paign
with the Siege of <HI>Asoph.</HI></P>
<P>Pursuant to this resolution having ordered a vast
Train of Artillery,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Besiege.</HI> Asoph.</NOTE> consisting of 400 Pieces of Can∣non,
and 150 Mortars, to be got ready, he March∣ed
with a very numerous Army, commanded un∣der
him by his Favourite, the General and Ad∣miral
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> (the Chief of the Ambassy, now in
<HI>Holland)</HI> by Mr. <HI>Gourdon,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> and <HI>Afranou
Nichelouits,</HI> a <HI>Muscovite,</HI> and laid close Seige to the
said City, whilst his Fleet guarded the Port, and
prevented any Supplies from coming to their Re∣lief
that way; and the <HI>Cosack</HI> Generals <HI>MaZepa,</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="249"/>
and <HI>Paley,</HI> advanced in two distinct Bodies towards
the <HI>Boristhenes,</HI> to give a powerful diversion to the
<HI>Crim Tartars</HI> on that side.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> within defended themselves for some
time with bravery enough, notwithstanding the
great havock made by the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Bombs, un∣der
the direction of the Foreign Bombardiers, but
finding themselves disappointed in their hopes of
Relief by Sea (the <HI>Muscovites</HI> having defeated those
that came to their Assistance) they beat a parley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes <HI>A∣soph</HI> by compo∣sition.</NOTE>
and Surrendered themselves, upon certain Articles,
to the Czar.</P>
<P>After the taking of <HI>Asoph,</HI> he advanced to
<HI>Karikeumen,</HI> which, by the force of his Bombs, he
soon obliged to Surrender at discretion. All the
Castles and Places thereabouts, underwent the same
fate, most of which he caused to be demolish'd,
unless it was <HI>Taran,</HI> where he left a very good
Garrison.</P>
<P>The same Summer the <HI>Cosacks</HI> had made them∣selves
Masters of several Strong Forts on the <HI>Bo∣risthenes,</HI>
which may in time much facilite the ta∣king
of <HI>Precop,</HI> Scituate at the very entrance of the
<HI>Taurica Chersonesus.</HI> The Czar after the Conquest
of a place so considerable for its Situation, was re∣ceived
at his return by his Subjects inhabiting the
City of <HI>Musco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Enters <HI>Mosco</HI> in Triumph.</NOTE> with all the demostrations of joy,
and other Honours due to a Conquerour: For at
his Entrance there were Triumphal Arches ere∣cted,
representing the Conquests of <HI>Asoph,</HI> and o∣ther
places taken by him the Summer before: And
as he went through the City to the Castle, he was
preceeded by the General <HI>Le Fort</HI> in a Litter, and
by General <HI>Gourdon</HI> on Horse back.</P>
<P>But what was most pleasing to the People, was,
the Leading it. Triumph of a certain noted De∣serter,
who's name was <HI>Jacob.</HI> He being taken
at the Surrender of <HI>Asoph,</HI> was brought into <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
and to compleat the Show, was placed up∣on
a high Waggon, Seated under a Gibbet; upon
which he was hanged the next day after this Solemn
Entry.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="249"/>
His next care was to send an Envoy to the-Court
of <HI>Vienna,</HI> not only to give an exact account
of the Success of his Arms against the Infidels, but
more particularly to enter into a more strict Al∣liance,
with the rest of the Confederates, against
the <HI>Turks:</HI> And having received certain intelligence,
that the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador in <HI>Poland,</HI> was labour∣ing
for the advancing of the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to
the <HI>Polish</HI> Crown, he gave the <HI>Polish</HI> Nobility to
understand by his Minister Resident in <HI>Poland,</HI>
that in case they should advance the Prince of <HI>Con∣ti,</HI>
or any other <HI>Frenchman</HI> to the Throne, they
must expect to be treated as Enemies, he looking
upon the <HI>French</HI> Nation, joyned in Alliance with
the <HI>Turks,</HI> to stand in opposition to the General In∣terest
of Christendom.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Negotiation at <HI>Vienna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concludes an Alli∣ance with the Confe∣derates a∣gainst the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE>
concerning the Alliance against the Infidels went on
with good Success the main Scruple to be removed,
being about the time of the Continuance of this
Alliance, and which the <HI>Muscovites</HI> desired to be
for Seven Years, whereas the Emperor and the
<HI>Venetians</HI> insisted to have it continued for no lon∣ger
than three Years. But the Czar having sent
new Instructions to his Envoy, with full power to
conclude the said Negotiation according to the
Proposals made by the rest of the Confederates, all
things were at last agreed on to the Satisfaction
of all the parties concerned in the Alliance, and
the Treaty was Sign'd and Ratifi'd at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in
the Presence of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Resident, containing
besides several others, these three following Articles.</P>
<P>That the Alliance shall last three Years, at least,
reserving to the Parties concerned, the power to re∣new
it, after that time is expired, if they think fit.</P>
<P>That none of the Parties shall make Peace, with∣out
the Knowledge and Consent of the other.</P>
<P><HI>And Lastly;</HI> that in Case the Enemy shall make
any Proposals of Peace to any one of the Confederates,
the same shall be imparted to all the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="250"/>
After the Conclusion of this Alliance the Empe∣rour
appointed a Minister to Reside with the Czar,
and to attend him in the Field, to be an eye wit∣ness
of what passed in the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Army, and
to give the Emperour from time to time an ac∣count
of their Progress against the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>The noise of this Alliance, and the great pre∣parations
made by the Czar against the next en∣suing
Campaign, struck such a terror to the <HI>Tar∣tar
Chan,</HI> that he dispatch'd frequent Messengers
to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to Sollicite Prompt and Power∣ful
Succours against the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> who were pre∣paring
to invade the <HI>Crim Tartary,</HI> and by the Con∣quest
of the City of <HI>Precop,</HI> to make themselves
Masters of the <HI>Taurica Chersenesus.</HI></P>
<P>These Remonstrances had such an influence o∣ver
the Ottoman Port, that they promised them
considerable Assistance, and it was given out, that
the Grand Seignior intended to go in person a∣gainst
the <HI>Muscovites;</HI> and tho' the last proved
to be only a Contrivance to amuse the Ene∣my,
yet the <HI>Turks</HI> being in the next Campaign de∣prived
of the Succours they generally used to re∣ceive
from these <HI>Tartars,</HI> did in a great Measure
attribute their last defeat to the want of these Aux∣iliaries,
who, by their number, used to stand
them in no small stead against the Impeiral Ca∣valry.</P>
<P>But whilst all <HI>Europe</HI> waited in expectation to hear
of the advance of his Czarish Majesty at the head of
a very formidable Army, towards the <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI>
they were agreeably Surprised with the news of a
great and Splendid <HI>Muscovian</HI> Ambassady arrived
in <HI>Prussia,</HI> where the Czar was in person, but in∣cognito.
This news, which at first carried along
with it but little probability, was put beyond que∣stion
after they had been received with so much
Solemnity by his Electoral Highness of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI>
at <HI>Konigsbergh,</HI> the Capital of the Ducal <HI>Prussia.</HI></P>
<P>The Chief of the Ambassy was <HI>Francis Jacolo∣vits
Le Fort,</HI> whom we have mentioned before, with
<PB N="219" REF="250"/>
whom were joyned as Colleagues <HI>Mexievits Ho∣lowin,
Damnos Diat Precophei,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mus∣covite</HI> Ambassa∣dors En∣trance in <HI>Konigs∣burgh.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Bodanovits Wor∣nits
Zien.</HI> Being arrived early in the morning at
<HI>Laut,</HI> about a mile distant from <HI>Konigsbergh,</HI> with
a Train of betwixt three and four Hundred Persons,
the Sieur <HI>Danckelman.</HI> Prime Minister of State,
and Mr. <HI>Besser,</HI> Master of the Ceremonies, with
a great number of Courtiers, and the Nobility of
the Country, were sent by his Electoral Highness,
to Complement them in his Name, and Conduct
them into the City, where in the afternoon they
made their Publick Entrance in the following man∣ner.
Forty of his Electoral Highnesses best led
Horses, with very rich Sadles, and other Accou∣trements,
led the way. These were followed by a
Single Officer richly clad, attended by the Kettle
Drums of the Guard of the Body, three Troops
of whom followed immeditely after, all clad
in Red.</P>
<P>Next to these came Thirty Coaches, drawn with
Six Horses each, in which were the Principal No∣bility
of the Ducal <HI>Prussia.</HI> Then two of his E∣lectoral
Highnesses Coaches, and one belonging to
the Margrave <HI>Albert.</HI> After these were to be seen
the Court Pages, clad all in Red▪ lac'd all over
very richly with Gold Lace, riding two and two
with a Page of the Ambassadors betwixt them.</P>
<P>These were followed by Fourty more Coaches,
with Six Horses each, wherein were the Chief
Ministers and Officers of the Electors Household;
after whom came the first Kettle Drum and Trum∣pet
belonging to his Electoral Highness, followed
by the Ambassadors Foot Guards, clad in Green,
with Silver Battle Axes upon their shoulders; and
after these the Ambassadors Horse Guards, in the
same Livery, but without Battle Axes.</P>
<P>Then came the Coach wherein were the
Four Ambassadors; and lastly, the whole Train
was closed with Twelve Coaches fill'd with <HI>Mus∣covite</HI>
and <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Gentlemen.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="251"/>
The Streets thro' which their Excellencies passed
to the <HI>Kniphoff,</HI> (where most Magnificent Lodg∣ings
were prepared for them) were lined with
the Burghers, who were drawn up in a double file:
They were received at their Lodgings by the Gar∣rison
of the City, and saluted with a treble dis∣charge
of all the Cannon round the Fortifications,
and being thus conducted to their Apartments, the
Sieurs <HI>Danckelman</HI> and <HI>Besser</HI> took their leave of
them, being waited on by the Ambassadors to the
Stairs of the House.</P>
<P>Some days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Have their Audience.</NOTE> being the 25. of <HI>May,</HI> they had
their Publick Audience of his Electoral Highness,
being again conducted by the abovementioned
Sieur <HI>Danckelman,</HI> and <HI>Besser</HI> the Master of the Ce∣remonies,
being followed by a Train of Thirty
odd Coaches. Before the Ambassadors Coach went
Thirty Persons, carrying the Czars Presents to
the Elector, consisting in Tables, Ermins, and o∣ther
Rich furs, beside a good quantity of <HI>Indian,</HI>
and <HI>Persian</HI> Silks, Stuffs, and Tissues of Gold, and
Silver; valued in all at 20000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling. The
Ambassadors themselves were most richly dress'd,
their Habits being of Cloth of Gold and Silver,
covered with rich Embroidery, and abundance of
Pearls and precious Stones. They passed thro' the
Electors Guards, which was placed on both sides
up to the Great Hall of the Castle, where the E∣lector,
attended by the Nobility, and all the Offi∣cers
of his Household, was Seated under a Cano∣py
of State.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors having made the usual reve∣rences,
every one in his turn, complemented his
Electoral Highness, and after having delivered the
Presents, they presented a Letter containing in Sub∣stance;
That his Czarish Majesty had sent these
(abovenamed) Persons as his Ambassadors, to his
Electoral Highness to give him all the possible
assurance of his desire to improve the Affection
and good Correspondence, which always had been
between them, and their Illustrious Ancestors That
<PB N="221" REF="251"/>
this Ambassy, being intended, to proceed from
hence to several other Courts in Christendom, in
order to concert Measures, and promote the com∣mon
Interest of the Confederacy, against the Infi∣dels;
his Czarish Majesty did not in the least que∣stion,
but that the Elector would assist them in so
glorious a Work, and forward them in their Jour∣ney.
The Letter concluded with the thanks from
the Great Duke to his Electoral Highness, for the
Engineers and Bombardiers, which he had sent
sometime before, and which by their extraordi∣nary
Skill had been very instrumental in the Siege
of <HI>Asoph,</HI> and other places, taken by the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
in the <HI>Crim Tartary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Elector answered;</HI> That he acknowledged him∣self
much obliged to the Czar, for his assurances of the
continuance of his Friendship, and especially for the
Splendid Ambassy he had sent to him.</P>
<P>But the Sieur <HI>Danckelman</HI> returned them an an∣swer
more at large, and in the Electors Name an∣swered
their Complements, in terms so obliging,
that the Ambassadors were extreamly satisfied with
his Generous and Genteel behaviour.</P>
<P>Being afterwards reconducted to their Lodgings
in the same manner, they were Treated with a most
Splendid Dinner by his Electoral Highness, and
were the same Evening, Entertained with variety
of extraordinary Fireworks, which lasted, to their
no small Satisfaction, till midnight.</P>
<P>Whilst the Czar of <HI>Moscovy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Czar obtains a great victory a∣gainst the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE> with his Ambassa∣dors,
was on his Journey towards <HI>Holland,</HI> his Ar∣my
obtain'd a Signal Victory against the <HI>Crim-Tar∣tars,</HI>
on the 30th of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Muscovites</HI> having drawn together their
Forces to the number of 70000 Men, most Horse;
the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> who had received advice of
their March thinking themselves Superior in num∣ber
and strength to the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> resolved to At∣tack
them before they were joyned by the <HI>Cosacks.</HI></P>
<P>In order to which, they advanced under the Com∣mand
of Sultan <HI>Galga,</HI> and attacked them with their
<PB N="222" REF="252"/>
utmost Vigor, but were received by the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Ca∣valry
with so much Resolution, that they were repulsed
and droven back in great disorder; but trusting in their
number they rallied again, and charged the <HI>Musco∣vites</HI>
with great Fury, till being, after some Hours
engagement quite broken, they were forced to quit
the Field, being pursued by the Enemy to the Ri∣ver
<HI>Kalganski,</HI> where a great slaughter ensued: For
being constrained, by the close pursuit of the <HI>Musco∣vites,</HI>
to cross that River with great Precipitation,
a great part of their Army not being able to fol∣low
the rest, with so much haste as their present dan∣ger
required, were either cut to pieces, or drowned
in the River, or taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>This Victory was the more advantageous to the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> because most of the <HI>Tartars</HI> having been
slain in the flight, the loss was not considerable on
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> side, for which reason great Rejoycings
were made in the City of <HI>Musco,</HI> and all over the
Empire.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Embassy was arrived in
<HI>Holland,</HI> where they received the first News of this
Victory, and made their publick Entry at the
<HI>Hague</HI> on the 17th of <HI>September,</HI> in great Splendor.</P>
<P>Before their Excellencies Coaches went a Train
of 50 others with 6 Horses each,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Mosco∣vite</HI> Am∣bassadors make their Entrance at the <HI>Hague.</HI></NOTE> wherein were
the Gentlemen of the Ambassador's Retinue, and
other Persons of Quality.</P>
<P>Then came the two Coaches of State, in which
rode the Ambassadors, who were followed by three
Coaches of their own, which closed the Cavalcade.</P>
<P>After they had passed through the Guards that
were placed on both sides of the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Au∣dience.</NOTE> they were
received by two Deputies of the States, in the Out-Room
of Audience. Being conducted into the Room
of Audience, they were saluted by the whole Body
of the States▪ unto whom they delivered the Czars
Letters, directed to their High and Mightinesses,
containing assurances of his Affection, and his de∣sire
of Cultivating a good Correspondence with the
State, desiring their High and Mightinesses to Treat
<PB N="223" REF="252"/>
with the (above-named) Ambassadors, concerning
such matters, as they should propose to them in his
Czarish Majesty's Name, to promote the Interest of
Christendom against the Infidels.</P>
<P>Then each of the Ambassadors having, in his
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, made a Complemental Speech to the States,
and delivered the Czar's Present, which consisted in
a great quantity of Sable-skins, of a considerable Va∣lue,
the Deputies answered them in a very Elo∣quent
Speech, in the Name of the States.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors were entreated to sit down, in
Elbow-Chairs set for that purpose, which they having
refused, and the whole Assembly judging, not with∣out
reason, that this refusal proceeded from the re∣spect
they bore to their Sovereign, there present,
did also continue in the same posture till the Audi∣ence
was over, when the Ambassadors were re-con∣ducted,
in the same Order as they came, to their
Lodgings.</P>
<P>For the better understanding the present conditi∣on
of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, it will be absolutely re∣quisite,
before we conclude this Treatise, to add
something concerning its Traffick, and present
Strength, in relation to its Neighbours; in both
which, it must be confessed, the <HI>Muscovites</HI> have im∣proved
themselves since the settlement of their Go∣vernment,
after their Intestine Commotions, to the
admiration of all those, who have taken the Pains
to make a due comparison betwixt their former con∣dition,
and the present State of their Empire.</P>
<P>Not to enlarge my self hereupon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade of <HI>Muscovy.</HI></NOTE> the Trade of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> depending on the product of the Country,
such as Pot-ashes, Wax, Honey, Tar, Pitch, Hemp,
Flax, Cavier, and Sturgeon, besides a great many other
Commodities which are exported from thence into
Foreign Countries. It is almost incredible, what
advantages the <HI>Muscovites</HI> reap from the <HI>Persian, In∣dian,</HI>
and <HI>Chinese</HI> Trade, lately established through∣out
the whole Empire. The staple of the <HI>Persian,</HI>
and <HI>Indian</HI> Trade is chiefly at <HI>Astrachan,</HI> which lying
within the Mouth of the River <HI>Volga,</HI> must be con∣sidered
<PB N="224" REF="253"/>
as the Frontierplace of the two most conside∣rable
parts of the World, to wit, of <HI>Europe,</HI> and
<HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Armenians</HI> possess one of the Suburbs of this
City by themselves, and drive a vast Trade from
thence into <HI>Persia;</HI> but they who without question
contribute most to the flourishing condition of this
City, and carry on the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade through
<HI>Muscovy,</HI> are the <HI>Banjans,</HI> a certain sort of <HI>Indians,</HI>
much addicted to Trading, and dispersed all over
the great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Territories, but especially inhabi∣ting
the Province of <HI>Guzuratte</HI> (by the <HI>Portuguesés</HI>
called <HI>Cambaya)</HI> who holding a Correspondence all
over the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, there are few sorts of Mer∣chandizes
which do not pass thro' their Hands.</P>
<P>For it is to be observed, that the Province of <HI>Guzu∣ratte</HI>
is Inhabited besides <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI>
by three several sorts of People by the <HI>Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stans,</HI> the
ancient Natives of the Country, an idle and sluggish
Generation; by the <HI>Moguls,</HI> who came out of <HI>Grand
Tartary,</HI> and are all <HI>Mahometans,</HI> much addicted to
Arms, and the <HI>Banjans,</HI> who altogether apply them∣selves
to Manufactury and Traffick. It is true,
there is no Province in <HI>India,</HI> where there are
not some of these <HI>Banjans,</HI> but in the Province of
<HI>Guzuratte</HI> they are more numerous than in other
places, and are distinguish'd, especially from those
that profess <HI>Mahometism,</HI> by their Habit.</P>
<P>For tho' they do not ware their Hair very long,
yet do they not shave their Heads.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ban∣jans</HI> descri∣bèd.</NOTE> Their Women
don't cover their Faces, as those of the <HI>Mahometans</HI>
do; they ware Pendants, and Pearls in their Ears,
and Necklaces about their Necks. Black Teeth
are amongst them as well as in <HI>Muscovy</HI> in great re∣quest,
from whence it comes that they nick Name
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who have white Teeth, <HI>Bondra,</HI> that
is, <HI>Apes.</HI> They ware no Breeches as the other <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
but only a piece of thin Silk stuff, which
is wrapt about them, reaching down to their Hams,
over which they ware their Smocks, and on them
their upper Garment, which they tie with a Girdle
<PB N="225" REF="253"/>
at the Waste: Some of them wear under these a
kind of narrow Wastcoats, the Sleeves whereof
reach no further than the Elbow, being naked from
the Breasts down to the Navel. They wear Shooes
either of Wood, Velvet, Brocade, or gilt
Leather, fastned with Straps to their Feet, which
they put off when they go into any Room, where
the Floor commonly is covered with Tapestry.</P>
<P>They are incomparably more Ingenious, Subtle,
and more Civil, than any of the other <HI>Indians.</HI> No
People in the World are more given to Writing and
casting Accounts than they, and their Conversation
is very delightful. There is no Trade in the Great
<HI>Turk</HI>'s Country, which is not chiefly managed by
them, nor any Commodity throughout all the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
which they do not sell, unless it be Flesh and Fish,
or any other Thing that had Life, which they are
bound to preserve by the Rules of their Religion,
as we shall relate anon.</P>
<P>They Marry their Children at 7, 8, 9, or 10
Years of Age, and it seldom appears that they stay
till 12, especially if they be Daughters; for if they
should exceed that time, it would be looked upon
as Scandalous.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banyan</HI> Widows are not permitted to Marry
a second time, even though the Bridegroom should
Die before the Consummation of the Marriage; but
all the Ornaments are to be taken from her, and her
Hair to be cut of immediately after the Husband's
Death. Nevertheless they are not obliged to burn
themselves with the Dead Bodies of their Husbands,
neither are they hindred to do it if they have an
inclination thereto. Those Widows in <HI>India,</HI> who
cannot dispense with a single Life, get in among
the Dancers of that Sex, where they have sufficient
opportunity to exercise the Flesh, and to allay the
heat which must needs be occasioned in Vigorous
Bodies lying in so hot a Climate.</P>
<P>This Barbarous Custom for the Widows to burn
themselves with their deceased Husbands, was first
introduced into those parts upon a Political account
<PB N="226" REF="254"/>
For <HI>Polygamy</HI> causing abundance of Heart burning
and Jealousie among the Women that were Rivals
in their Husbands Affections, it often happen'd,
that such as thought themselves neglected, used fre∣quently
to procure their Husbands Deaths. Where∣fore
to make them to be more careful of their Hus∣bands
Lives, it was ordered, that such as were de∣sirous
to be accounted honest Women, should be
engaged to keep their Husbands company in their
Journey to the other World, and be burnt together
with their Bodies. So that tho' this obligation of
dying with their Husbands was only imposed upon
such Women as stood upon the reputation of their
Honesty, without any punishment to be inflicted
on such as refused to conform themselves to so
dreadful a Custom, unless they were not admitted
into the Company of Persons of Quality, as being
looked upon as Infamous; yet has this principle of
Honour been so prevailing upon a vast number of
the <HI>Indian</HI> Women, that there are innumerable ex∣amples,
of such as have sacrificed their Lives upon
the Pile which burnt the dead Carcasses of their
Husbands.</P>
<P>But as among all the Sects of the <HI>Indians,</HI> there
have been Women, who, with the same chearfulness
have thrown away their Lives to the memory of
their Husbands, as those of the Sect of <HI>Samarath,</HI>
whose Perswasion is, that if a Woman hath so great
an Affection for her Husband; as to burn her self
with him after his Death, she shall live with him in
the other World seven times as long, and shall en∣joy
him with seven times as much satisfaction as she
has done in this; it is most probable, that they are
induced to this resolution, not altogether by the mo∣tive
of a Punctillo of Honour, but look on this
kind of Death as a Passage, thro' which they are
to enter into a beatitude of these Pleasures, where∣of
they had but a small share in this World.</P>
<P>But to return to our <HI>Banyans,</HI> who having a con∣siderable
share in the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> very
well deserve our particular description here.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="254"/>
The <HI>Banyans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of the <HI>Ban∣yans.</HI></NOTE> therefore, are <HI>Pagans,</HI> using neither
Baptism nor Circumcision; yet they believe that
there is but one God, Creator and Preserver of the
Universe. Neither does this perswasion hinder it,
that they acknowledge one <HI>Braman,</HI> who they say,
is God's Vicegerent, (as they call the great God of
all the other Gods <HI>Etvara)</HI> and out of who's Brains,
they say, their <HI>Bramans,</HI> or Priests derive their first
Being. They are highly respected among the <HI>Ban∣yans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their</HI> Bra∣mens.</NOTE>
as well as the other Pagans in <HI>India,</HI> not only
upon the account of their austerity of Life, and
their extraordinary Abstinence, they fasting some∣times
several Days together, scarce eating any
thing at all, but also in regard the Education
of the Youth is committed to their care, and that
they expound the mysteries of their Religion to the
ignorant People; so that making what impression
they think most convenient for their purpose, on the
minds of the superstitious <HI>Indians,</HI> their Words are
considered as Oracles; from whence it comes, that
the <HI>Banyans</HI> seldom engage in any business of con∣sequence,
unless with the Advice and Approbation
of the <HI>Braman.</HI></P>
<P>They are distinguished from the other <HI>Banyans,</HI>
only by what they wear upon their Heads, which
is a certain Head-dress made of Linnen Cloth,
wrapt several times round the Head, to cover their
Sacred Hair, which is never cut. Besides which,
they wear three pieces of small Packthread next
their Skin, which comes cross over the Breast from
the Shoulder to the Wast, which Packthreads they
never pull of, tho' it were to save their Lives.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Malataps,</HI> they are looked upon as so
Holy, that no Marriage is contracted there, but
the first Fruits of the Bride must be Consecrated to
the <HI>Braman,</HI> to whom she is brought to be deflour'd,
and being thus purified in her lower parts, the
Bridegroom may enter without danger. For the
cunning Priests have cajoled the poor simple People
into a belief, that the Marriage could never be suf∣ficiently
Blessed, unless the <HI>Braman</HI> has initiated the
<PB N="228" REF="255"/>
Bride with a Sanctifying touch. From whence it
comes, that many times he must be very earnestly
intreated, before he will undertake the Task; and
if the Persons be of any Quality or good Substance,
he will scarce be engaged to take of the drudgery
from the Bridegroom's Hands, unless he be hire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the Work, and have a good reward for his Pains.</P>
<P>Thus the crafty Priest, by imposing upon the
simplicity of his Flock, improves his natural Tal∣lent
to his utmost Advantage, satisfies at one stroak
both his Appetite and Purse, and fells his Benevo∣lence
at an excessive price, which a Layman would
be glad to bestow generously, for nothing. But
this is not all, for if the Priest once gets sure foot∣ing
in a good place, he is sure not to part with it
at an easie rate, but remains a standing Friend to the
Family; for the Married Men retain so much kind∣ness
ever after for their Copartners, that, if they
go any Journey, or upon any occasion are de∣tained
from Home, they recommend their whole Fa∣mily
(but especially their Wives) to the care of
the <HI>Braman,</HI> while they are absent, to supply their
places with them, till they return, which you may
be sure the Priest will perform to the utmost of his
Power, unless the good Woman happen to be very
old or ugly, or he be disabled to do his Office
by his long fasting, in which case it is the
Womans business to cherish the Father's languish∣ing
Spirits, with powerful Restoratives, at which
the <HI>Indian</HI> Women are the most expert in the
whole World, as they are very skilful to send their
Husbands upon certain occasions, to the enjoy∣ments
of the other World.</P>
<P>But to return to the more serious part of their Re∣ligion;
they hold the immortallity of the Soul, but
believe, withal, that at its departure out of the first
Body, it transmigrates into that of some other Crea∣ture.
Thus they affirm, that by example, the Soul
of a good natur'd and meek Person, is translated in∣to
the Body of a Pidgeon or Chicken; that of a
Cruel and Rapacious Fellow into a Crocodile, a
<PB N="229" REF="255"/>
Lyon, or a Tyger; that of a Cunning and Crafty
Man, into that of a Fox, That of a Glutton into
the body of Swine; that of a Treacherous and Ma∣licious
Person into a Serpent, before they are admit∣ted
to the enjoyment of Spiritual Beatitude. For
which reason it is the <HI>Banyans</HI> abstain as we men∣tioned
before, from killing any living Creatures, e∣ven
to the Insects, be they never so troublesome or
dangerous. Nay they Act with so much Circum∣spection
in regard of all Living Creatures, of what
kind soever, that they forbear keeping any fire, and
lighting of Candles, in the Night time, out of fear,
that the Flies or Moths should chance to burn them∣selves
therein; they scarce can be induced to make
any Pits in the ground, for fear of drowning the
Slegs and other Insects.</P>
<P>If the Mahometans among them do sell any Birds,
they will be sure to redeem them, if possibly they
can, and feed them well, because, say they, we
don't know, how soon our selves may stand in need
of the same kindness; and they will Erect Hospi∣tals
for Beasts that are Hurt or Wounded.</P>
<P>They have a more then ordinary respect for
Cows, so that if they know of any one that is to
be killed for the Market, they will not only pur∣chase
and redeem it at a high rate from the slaugh∣ter;
but there is scarce a family, but what breeds
up one, almost as tenderly as their own Children;
For they will comb and feed it, and lodge it as
cleanly, and as carefully as if it were one of their
best Friends or Relations.</P>
<P>They never eat but in private, and before they
touch the Victuals, they throw some small quantity
of it separately into the Fire, the Water, the Air,
and upon the Earth. They have abundance of o∣ther
pretended niceties, too many to be inserted
here; but it ought not to be passed by in silence,
that tho' they acknowledge one Supream God,
they nevertheless worship the Devil, alledging for
a reason, that God having created him to govern
<PB N="230" REF="256"/>
the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They wor∣ship the Devil.</NOTE> and to do hurt to Mankind, he ought
to be appeased by Prayers and Sacrifices.</P>
<P>From whence it is, that his Statues of Gold,
Silver, Ivory, Ebony, Marble, Wood or Stone are
every where to be seen in their Mosques, the fi∣gure
of which appears most dreadful to the eyes
of the Beholders. For his Head, out of which
come forth four Horns is adorn'd with a triple
Crown in the shape of a Taira. His Face resem∣bles
that of a large Boar, with two great Teeth
coming out of his Mouth; and a great ugly.
Beard on his Chin. He bends his Breast to his Bel∣ly,
where the Hands hang down negligently. Be∣twixt
his Thighs there appears another Head with
two Horns upon it, as ugly as the first, thrusting out
of the Mouth, a Tongue of extraordinary bigness.
Instead of Teeth it hath Saws, and a Cows Tail
behind. This Figure stands always upon a Stone
Table, this being the Altar where the offerings are
to to be made. They have no other light in their
Mosque, than what they are furnish'd withall by
the Lamps which are kept burning perpetually
near the Idol: And after the Priest has finished
his Devotious, he purifies his Head, by putting
it into these Flames, as the other <HI>Banyans</HI> pu∣rifie
themselves before the Sacrifice, by washing in
a Trough, which always stands on the right side
of the Altar.</P>
<P>But it being beyond our present Scope, to di∣gress
further into the cloudy and Superstitious Rites
of these <HI>Banyans,</HI> let us return to their traffick,
which seems to be more suitable to our present in∣tention.
These <HI>Banyans</HI> therefore being the most in
number throughout the Cities of <HI>Surat, Blevitshia,
Gandeer, Goga, Cambaya, Dium, Pateppatene, Manga∣lor,
Gondore, Massary, Gandivi, Balsara,</HI> and in the
Metropolis of the Province <HI>Hamed Ewad,</HI> or <HI>Ama∣dabath;</HI>
they manage the whole Trade of <HI>India,</HI>
not only in Silks, Cottons, but also all sorts of
Proveado's of Gold and Silver, Sattins, Velvets,
Taffata's, Sattins for Linings and Carpets, quilted
<PB N="231" REF="256"/>
Coverlets of Silk or Cotton, Tents, which are u∣sed
instead of Coaches, Cabinets of Lacque, Chest
boards of Tortoise Shell, Seals, Beads, Chains, But∣tons
and Rings of Ivory, Amber, Rock Christal or
Agat.</P>
<P>The other Commodities which by the <HI>Banyans</HI>
are transported into <HI>Mnscovy</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> are, Sugar
candy'd or in powder, Cummin, Opium, Ginger,
dry and preserv'd Myrobolans or <HI>Indian</HI> Plums, Sal
Armonias Musk, Amber Greece, Lacque, Saltpe∣ter,
Indico, Borax, Assafaetida, and Diamonds, besides
several sorts of other precious Stones.</P>
<P>The Lacque is a Gumm taken out of a certain
Tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lacque, how made.</NOTE> not much unlike a Plum Tree, there is a∣bundance
of it all over the Province of <HI>Guzurette;</HI>

colour they please, make it into Sticks, for to Seal
Letters, or beatfiie their Cabinets, and other House∣hold
Stuff.</P>
<P>Saltpeter is made in those parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saltpeter, how made.</NOTE> out of the black∣est
and Saltest ground in the following manner; ha∣ving
made certain Trenches, they fill them with this
Nitrous Earth, and let into them out of the Adja∣cent
small Rivulets, so much water as they think suf∣ficient,
for its soaking, which that it may be the
more effectually done, they tread it with their feet,
till it be well mix'd. When they believe the Wa∣ter
to have drawn out all the Nitrous Substance,
which was in the Earth, they take, after it be well
setled, the clearest part of it, which they dispose in▪
another Trench, where after some time it grows
thick, and then they boil it like Salt continually
scumming it. Lastly they put it into a great Earth∣en
pots, where the grossest dregs falling to the bot∣tom,
they take of the Saline Substance, which is
set a drying in the Sun, till it grows hard, and is
reduced into that form, as we see it in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The best Indigo in the World comes from about
<HI>Amadabath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Indigo, how prepared.</NOTE> the Capital of the Province of <HI>Guzu∣rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI>
from a Village called <HI>Chirphees.</HI> The Herb
<PB N="232" REF="257"/>
out of which that is made, is not unlike that of
Yellow Parsnip, but shorter and of a more bitter
taste; It sprouts forth to branches like a Reed,
growing some Years, when the season proves kind,
Six or Seven foot high, with a flower like that that
of a Thistle, and the seed altogether like Fenu∣greek.
It is seldom sown till in <HI>June,</HI> and is ready
to be cut towards towards the latter end of <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI>
or the beginning of <HI>December.</HI> They Sow it
but once in three Years, but the first year produces
the best, when the leaves are cut off within a foot
of the ground. The Stalks are thrown away as 
useless, and the leaves laid a drying in the Sun▪
which done they are put a put a soaking for four
or five days in a Stone Trough, the Water with
the leaves is often stirred, till such time that the
Water has sufficiently extracted the whole tincture
of the Herb. Then the Water is smoothly drawn
off into another Stone Trough, in order to let it
settle for one night. The next day, all the Wa∣ter
is again drawn off to the settlement, and what,
is thus left in the bottom of the Troughs, is strain∣ed
through a course Cloth, and so set a drying in
the Sun.</P>
<P>And this is true Indigo, which however the <HI>Ban∣yans</HI>
frequently adulterate; by mixing with it a cer∣tain
Earth of the same Colour. And because the
excellency of this Commodity is judged by its light∣ness,
they have cunning enough to add to it some
oyl, to make it swim upon the Water. The second
year, the Stalk which was left in the ground the
year before, shoots forth other leaves, but they are
not comparable to those of the first, tho' they much
exceed the Wild Indigo. Wherefore they reserve
the greatest part of the second Years product for
Seed. That of the third Year, is as much infe∣rsour
in goodness to that of the second, as that is
in comparison of that of the first, and being there∣fore
in no esteem among forreign Merchants, is on∣made
use of in the Country, in dying of their
Cloaths. After it hath been in the ground three
<PB N="233" REF="257"/>
Years, they let the Land lye fallow for one Year,
before they set it again</P>
<P>The <HI>Banyans</HI> in General, are the most crafty
Traders in the World, which makes the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
(as do also the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>India</HI>) employ
those residing at <HI>Astrachan</HI> and in other parts of the

as being the most likely to discover the cheats
of their brethren in <HI>India.</HI> Both the <HI>Banyans</HI> and
<HI>Armenians</HI> residing at <HI>Astrachan</HI> are very industrious
in keeping a constant correspondence with the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
and <HI>Persians</HI> in their respective Countries, but
especially in all the Seaports of the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea,
which by reason of the vast number of Rivers
that exonerate themselves into it, rendereth the
Commerce with <HI>Persia,</HI> and consequently with the
<HI>Infidels</HI> very commodious to the <HI>Muscovites.</HI></P>
<P>Among others the great City <HI>Gangea,</HI> one of the
fairest and best in <HI>Persia,</HI> by reason of its advan∣tageous
Situation for trade upon the confluence of
several Rivers, and the great Croud of strangers
that resort thither on the account of Traffick is
frequently visited by the <HI>Muscovian</HI> Factors, the
<HI>Banyans</HI> and <HI>Armenians.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Shamachie</HI> is the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Shamachi</HI></NOTE> which chiefly fur∣nishes
the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> by reason of its nearness to
the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, with such <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Com∣modities,
as they stand in need of. This City was
indeed formerly much bigger than it was now,
the greatest part of it having been about twenty
Years ago ruin'd by an Eathquake, yet notwith∣standing
this misfortune it is still very considerable,
there being not in all the <HI>Persian</HI> Empire a City,
where there is so general a resort of strangers of
all Nations, to wit, of <HI>Armenians, Banyans, Geor∣gians,
Greeks, Turks, Circasians</HI> and <HI>Muscovites;</HI> the

or publick Storehouse, where they truck their
Tin, <HI>Russia</HI> Leather, Copper, Furrs, and other Mer∣chandises,
for the precious Commodities of <HI>India</HI>

a Communication betwixt the great Rivers the

<P>I have hitherto withal the enquiry I could make▪
not been able to be fully instructed in what place
it is, that this Communication betwixt these two
Rivers is to be perfected; But thus much is most
probale, that it must either be effected by cutting
a Canal on this side of the first Branch of the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Communi∣cation be∣twixt the Rivers, <HI>Don</HI> and <HI>Wolga.</HI></NOTE> near the City of <HI>Zariza,</HI> where the <HI>Don</HI>
advances within Seven Leagues of the <HI>Wolga,</HI> for
else by rendring the small River of <HI>Kamous</HI> Navi∣gable,
which rising out of the <HI>Don,</HI> falls below the

<HI>Muscovy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> Trade.</NOTE> how the way thither was first disco∣vered

carry on that Trade, has been circumstantially re∣lated
<PB N="235" REF="258"/>
in the first part, in that Chapter where we
treated of <HI>Siberia,</HI></P>
<P>We have therefore only thus much to add here;
that as by the help of the <HI>Banyans</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Muscovites</HI> maintain a constant correspondence
with the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> so, with the assistance
of those they call, <HI>Kitachi,</HI> they keep up their Com∣munication
with <HI>China.</HI> These <HI>Kitachi</HI> go com∣monly
under the Name of <HI>Chineses</HI> in <HI>Muscovy,</HI> by
reason, that the <HI>Muscovites</HI> call all the Inhabitants
betwixt the River <HI>Oby,</HI> the <HI>Wolga</HI> and <HI>China</HI> (which
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> properly the <HI>Great Tartary)</HI> by the Name of <HI>Ka∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI>
But in regard the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> (as we men∣tioned
in the first Volumns, have made such con∣siderable
discoveries on that side of late Years, as
to have built several Cities, for the security of their
Colonies on that Side, they have also by degrees
drawn abundance of these wandering People to these
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, where after once they became fix'd, and be∣gan
to have a true Sense of the Benefits, and Ad∣vantage
of a Settled Life, they have settled them∣selves
in the other parts of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and prove ve∣ry
beneficial to the <HI>Russians,</HI> to carry on the <HI>Chi∣nese</HI>
Trade, by their Correspondence with the se∣veral
<HI>Tartarian</HI> Nations, Inhabiting that spacious
Country betwixt <HI>Siberia</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> Wall.</P>
<P>As the accession of these forreign Nations, has
been of great advantage to the encrease of Trade,
and the Wealth of the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire, so it has
contributed not a little to the peopling of the Coun∣try,
which by reason of their intestine Commotions
in our age, and frequent Inroads made by the <HI>Crim
Tartars,</HI> was laid, in a great many parts, in a man∣ner
desolate. This is most conspicuous in the fertile
Plains on both sides of the River <HI>Steca,</HI> down to the
<HI>Wolga,</HI> almost as far as <HI>Cesau,</HI> which not many
Years ago were in a manner dispeopled, but now
are stock'd with an infinite number of Towns and

Years so well recovered its pass'd disasters, that it
is incomparable more Beautiful than ever it was
<PB N="236" REF="259"/>
before, and is reckoned to contain at present no less
than betwixt Six and Seven Hundred Thousand
Inhabitants of several Nations.</P>
<P>As the prodigious encrease of the Capital City,
must chiefly be attributed to the great conco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
of the various Trading Nations we have mentio∣nen,
so the peopling of the Country is to be ascri∣bed
to the prudence of the Czar <HI>Alexis Michae∣louits</HI>
the present Czar's Father, who finding his Ter∣ritories
exhausted of men, in his War with the
<HI>Poles,</HI> carried away a number of Captives out of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣thuania,</HI>
and the other <HI>Polish</HI> Provinces bordering
on <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as were sufficient to plant several Co∣lonies
all along the Rivers <HI>Gecca</HI> and <HI>Wolga,</HI> who ha∣ving
been encouraged by several priviledges grant∣ed

manner as it appears at present,</P>
<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength of the <HI>Mus∣covites</HI> in respect of their Neigh∣bours.</NOTE> since we have sufficiently spoke concerning

they receive by their Trade in the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, en∣gages
them equally to keep a good understanding be∣twixt
them, especially since, upon occasion they may
be very serviceable to one another against the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars,</HI> bordering the North East upon <HI>Si∣beria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Tar∣tars.</NOTE>
and some other Provinces under the Czar of

the <HI>Calmuc Tartars)</HI> used to be verry trouble∣some
to some of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Provinces, depend∣ing
upon the <HI>Russian</HI> Empire; nevertheless since the
<HI>Muscovites</HI> have guarded the Frontiers on that side,
<PB N="237" REF="259"/>
with good Fortifications and Garrisons, and have
made these Vagabonds sensible of the advantage
of their Fire Arms, they are not so forward in ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing,
their irruptions. Their only way they make

on the Frontiers, and to send their Deputies
into <HI>Muscovy;</HI> by which means they get considera∣ble
Presents, from the Czar, who thinks it more
Prudence to purchase the Friendship of a Vagabond

himself to the expence of sending an Army against

Wars, with a considerable Number of Horse, and are
very serviceable to the <HI>Muscovite</HI> in furthering their
Passage and Traffick into <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Crim Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Turks <HI>and</HI> Crim Tartars.</NOTE> used to be the

<HI>Muscovy,</HI> to the very Gates of its Capital City.</P>
<P>Czar <HI>Michael Frederovits</HI> endeavoured to prevent
their Incursions, by causing the Woods to be cut
down in some places, and by reason of a Line
strengthened with a Moat, of about Five Hundred
Miles in Length; but they did not rest, till they
had pull'd down the first, and fill'd up the last,
and by their frequent Incursions had almost ren∣dred
that part of <HI>Muscovy</HI> quite desolate. For which
reason the <HI>Muscovites</HI> were always obliged to keep
a considerable Body of Horse on the Frontiers, and
sometimes to give them a diversion by the help of
the <HI>Donepsian Cosacks,</HI> and the <HI>Nogajan Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>But the case is much alter'd as to this particular of
late Years; For since the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> by vertue of a
