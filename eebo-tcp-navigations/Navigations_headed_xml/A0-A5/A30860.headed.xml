<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEre are the Travels of our <HI>Italian Gentleman,</HI> that you have so long desired to peruse in our Language. It is an ex∣cellent description of that Great Em∣pire that is so near related unto us by Religion, and nevertheless at such a distance from us. I hope it will fully answer your expectation, for you shall find in it most delightful passages, with an exact account of the Man∣ners, Laws, Government, and of all other particulars in the Dominions of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> worth the notice of an Inge∣nious
<PB REF="123"/>
Traveller. It may be that this small Treatise may meet with the ill fortune which such are to expect that thwart or disapprove of grand de∣signs and furt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us enterprises. It matters not what aspersions may be raised to darken its Truth, and hinder its appearance and credit; I hope the probability of all the matters▪ related, &amp; that may be also gathered from the place where it was first published, will dissipate all envious vapours, and cause <HI>Ethiopia</HI> to appear amongst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in its own shape and form. Our Gentleman had committed an act not agreeable to that Judgment that he shews in his writings to publish things of a Kingdom so well known to most parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> by reason of the conti∣nual correspondency that the Princes of it do entertain by their Factors with the <HI>Grand Neguz</HI>) had there been any thing in his Relation not re∣al, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r untrue. His Book had not found

that universal applause to be twice honoured with the Press, had it not found amongst his Country-men a re∣ception suitable to its worth.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY OF Precious John, Vulgarly called <HI>PRESTER JOHN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Empire of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> is not inferiour to the lar∣gest in the World, if we consider that vast Continent that
<PB N="2" REF="125"/>
was anciently, and should be now under the Command of the law∣ful Heir. It contained above thir∣ty large Kingdoms, and many fruitful Provinces well furnished with Men, and stored with Rich Commodities; but the late un∣happy Wars with the Neighbour Kings have much weakned this growing Empire, and reduced it to a little number.</P>
<P>The Turks, the <HI>Gialas,</HI> the King of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> the <HI>Moors,</HI> and several others that surround this Christian Principality, have dis-membred the Provinces and Kingdoms that were anciently subject to it, and submitted them to their several Jurisdictions. The <HI>Moors</HI> have seized on the Sea∣coast, the <HI>Turks</HI> have conquer'd the most fruitful Kingdoms that confine upon <HI>Egypt,</HI> the <HI>Gialas</HI> a war-like Re-publick of <HI>Africa,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="125"/>
command several large Ter∣ritories that belong unto this Imperial Crown. The King of <HI>Mozambique</HI> and the rest have robbed it of its chief Jewels and Ornaments, so that at present it is nothing so large, nor so considera∣ble as formerly it was. The cause of these great Losses must be at∣tributed to the Cowardise and unexperience of the Inhabitants more inclinable to Superstition than war-like feats, and to the diversity of Religion in which these Nations differ much from the Abyssins. The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> are nourished up in the Ma∣humetan, the <HI>Gialas</HI> and they of <HI>Mozambique</HI> in the Heathenish I∣dolatrie (which cannot comply with the Christian Truth.) The Professors of the former, have a natural antipathy against the Pro∣selites of the latter; insomuch,
<PB N="4" REF="126"/>
that they can scarce suffer them to breath in the same air. This hatred entertained by the different ways of worshipping the Creator, hath fomented all these wars and troubles that have for many hun∣dred years shaken the Abyssin Empire, and separated from it the most excellent, and the largest Provinces that did belong unto it; so that at present it is reduced to a very narrow Circuit in com∣parison of what it was. The Em∣perour nevertheless maintains the same State as he did formerly, and claims a right to all those King∣doms that he hath lost. His pre∣sent Dominions are not above 800 English miles in length, and 600 in bredth; they contain these Kingdoms, <HI>Amara, Tigre∣mahon, Angot, Xoa, G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ama, Baga∣midri, Damut, Fategar, Barnagaez, Baru, Tigrai, Vangue,;</HI> so that
<PB N="5" REF="126"/>
they are limited on the North by <HI>Nubia,</HI> and the Mountains and Sands that separate them from <HI>E∣gypt;</HI> on the East, by the Kingdoms of <HI>Zangebara, Aiana</HI> and <HI>Adel,</HI> which lie upon the red Sea; on the South, the Provinces of <HI>Cafutes</HI> and <HI>Fungi</HI> do shut it, and on the West this Empire confines upon <HI>Congo, Medra</HI> and the <HI>Blacks.</HI> This Rich and In-land Country I have discovered by my Travels, and now that I am so happily returned to my own Native soil, after so long and troublesome a Journey, I owe to my Country a Relation of those things that I have learned, which I may say, never any knew so much of this place before, as the Reader may find in this Book. In the year 1655. some Mer∣chants of <HI>Florence</HI> were preparing to sail for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> I resolved to adventure my self in their
<PB N="6" REF="127"/>
Company, out of a great desire to visit the Holy-Land, and see for∣rein places. I had then received some discontent at home, which made me seek my satisfaction a∣broad; having therefore furnish∣ed my self with large sums of mo∣ney, and a Man Servant, I embar∣qued with them in a Dutch bot∣tom, and in a fortnights time we landed in that ancient City which <HI>Alexander</HI> had built. The plague was then very hot in that place, which obliged us to a short stay there. Some French Merchants were then going for Grand <HI>Cairo;</HI> my company perswaded me to take my journey with them, and visit the curiosities of that large City; I was not willing to take that Road so soon, for I desired first to pay my devotions at the Sepulcher of our Lord, but the perswasions of my friends forced
<PB N="7" REF="127"/>
me to leave that journey until my return, because we could not find a fit opportunity to travel in∣to the Holy-Land I went there∣fore with the French Merchants to <HI>Catro,</HI> and spent some days there in viewing all the Rari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of that Great City; we had a sight there and in our way of many An∣tiquities which are so well known to all the world, that I shall not so much as mention them. I had not been there a month, but a <HI>Ca∣ravan</HI> was preparing for the Red Sea. The French Consul, at whose house I lay, encouraged me to take that occasion of discovering those Parts where Christians of of Quality seldom adventure themselves; assuring me, that it would be worth my while to see those remote places, and discover something to the Christian world, which was not known before. It
<PB N="8" REF="128"/>
happened that as I was medita∣ting upon this journey, an <HI>Abuna</HI> or a High Priest of the Abyssins came to the Patriarchs house from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in his journey to∣wards <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> intending to take the same way as the <HI>Caravan,</HI> be∣cause it was the safest. This acci∣dent I lookt upon as an invitation of providence amongst those <HI>A∣frican</HI> Christians that are not well known to our Northern Climates. Having therefore furnished my self with Moneys and Bills of Ex∣change for so long a journey, I sought the acquaintance of the <HI>Abuna</HI> before my departure. It was no difficulty to obtain, for he was learned in the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue, and well versed in the manner and Customs of the <HI>Franks;</HI> he was a Man of a swarthy countenance, both pleasant and grave, of a high stature, about 60 years of
<PB N="9" REF="128"/>
age, very lusty; he had not many to attend him, for he was not wil∣ling to discover himself amongst the <HI>Turks,</HI> who might have made advantage of him, by obliging him to larger disbursements than his Estate could allow: I was re∣solved to accompany him into his own Country, and visit the Court of the great <HI>Neguz</HI> so famous all over the world; we therefore en∣gaged our selves in the <HI>Caravan.</HI> I went for an <HI>Italian</HI> pilgrim, whose Person is much respected amongst the Heathens themselves, and least subject to the affronts and insults of strangers. The <HI>A∣buna</HI> was also in the disguise of a Merchant, he had with him some Goods of a small value; we began our journey in the moneth of <HI>March,</HI> and through several mis∣fortunes we arrived at the Port Town of the Red Sea called <HI>Suez,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="129"/>
a famous place for Trade, it is the passage into <HI>Arabia Indostan</HI> and all other Countries of <HI>Asia.</HI> Here are therefore a great company of Merchants of all Nations that en∣rich this place, which otherwise would be very unconsiderable. It is a City fortified with a Castle and a Fort upon the mold as big as <HI>Pisa.</HI> The buildings are large, fitter for Merchants than Noble∣men; some are beautified with black and white Marble curiously wrought. Here is a Synagogue of the <HI>Jews</HI> much frequented on the Sabbath day, here is also an Idol Temple for the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but the poor Christians have no other place appointed for their Devoti∣ons, but their Chambers and Hou∣ses. The <HI>Abuna</HI> found here some Abyssin Merchants, at whose dwellings he was courteously re∣ceived, and honouraby entertain∣ed;
<PB N="11" REF="129"/>
they invited me to share with him in their Hospitality; I accepted their kind offer, because I had no mind to separate my self from him, seeing my design was to accompany him as far as his Emperours Court. Here we re∣mained several months, because we heard of an Army of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> that were making an In∣road into the Territories of the Abyssins, we were advised to ex∣pect with patience their return, for otherwise we might have met them in the way and been brought back into Captivity, our liberty was too precious a thing to be un∣considerately ventured we; there∣fore remained a long while in this City expecting a fair opportuni∣ty to be gone. At last one pre∣sented it self not unworthy of our acceptance, the <HI>Turks Basha</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> sent an Ambassadour to the
<PB N="12" REF="130"/>
<HI>Precious John,</HI> who coming to <HI>Suez,</HI> we thought we could not meet with a greater happiness if we could be admitted into his re∣tinue. We had some difficulty to obtain this favour, but upon the offer of 200 Crowns, it was rea∣dily granted. He took his leave of this City with a great Train, and we accompanyed him upon Mules, we passed through many different Soils, some fruitful, e∣specially of Date-trees, others ve∣ry barren. The most part of our way was over craggy Mountains, where nothing did present it self to our view but wild Beasts far different from those that I have seen in <HI>Europe.</HI> We passed through some inhabited Land, where very strong Castles were e∣rected to defend the Country from the enemies, the <HI>Moers</HI> did possess them, for this Nation is
<PB N="13" REF="130"/>
dispersed all over this Country, we found also some stragling Tents of <HI>Arabians</HI> that wandred up and down, we met with no∣thing remarkable, but Poverty and Misery, that seem to have taken up their Residence amongst the people that inhabit in this part of the world far in the Country. Their diet is such things as this barren habitation will afford them; their bread is a root, their flesh is of such wild Creatures as they can happily kill, their Cloathing proclaims their needy condition, it is made of a large leaf of a Tree that grows in the Forrests and Woods, neither is it sufficient to cover the back, so it hides the <HI>pu∣denda hominis,</HI> they are abundant∣ly content; for that purpose a string is ty'd above their middle unto which these leaves are faste∣ned, so that like so many Pen∣dants
<PB N="14" REF="131"/>
they fall down and cover what nature teaches to hide. They have one conveniency and advan∣tage which they enjoy above our common people, as our Princes and Noblemen of <HI>Europe</HI> they wear not their Apparel long, they change often, almost every day. These rascally sort of people that nature hath brought forth a∣mongst these mountains, did ap∣pear unto us almost like Savages, they did not willingly come in our company, nor are they desirous to change their habitation, their bo∣dies were big, and their Members thick and swarthy, they spoke a mixt <HI>Arabian,</HI> not well to be under¦stood but by those that know all the dialects of that language; those that live in the fortified places are far more sociable, they had chosen the most convenient seats for their residence, some of the ground was
<PB N="15" REF="131"/>
fit to Sow and Plow, and to feed Cattel. We were admitted into one of these Castles that was e∣rected in the passage of a mountain very conveniently to hinder and stop the course of any enemy; the Commander in chief was a <HI>Moor,</HI> he received us with some expres∣sions of affection, but before we deparred we were forced to pay dear for our entertainment, ten Dollers a piece, for that is a Coin that is currant over all the world. The Embassadour and those that did wait upon him were free, but for all strangers that did follow him in his journey, they were ob∣liged to lay down the money or return back again. This little Ty∣rant had gathered together some numbers of men, who lived thus in this difficult place upon all passen∣gers, forcing them to contribute to the maintenance of their lazy bo∣dies.
<PB N="16" REF="132"/>
There are many such peo∣ple that exact upon strangers, the Governors for the <HI>Turk</HI> do wink at them, because at a certain time of the year they send a sweet per∣fume unto them, a Purse full of Gold and Silver, and in considera∣tion of this yearly tribute, they suffer them to exact, cheat and rob the poor Travellers and Mer∣chants. We advanced far into the Country many days journey be∣fore we came to the <HI>Turks</HI> Army, they were upon their return from pillaging the Christians, they were laden with spoils and slaves. They made as much haste as they could in their march, for the <HI>Pre∣cious John</HI> had gathered his Army together, and was in the pursuit of them from <HI>Suez;</HI> we came first into the Country called by the In∣habitants <HI>Ganfila,</HI> next to <HI>Dafro∣ha,</HI> and so through <HI>Barnagasso, Lacca</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="132"/>
and part of <HI>Dangali;</HI> we arrived at last upon the borders. The bo∣dy of the <HI>Turks</HI> Army when we met it was near a large lake full of excellent fish. The people of this Country are ignorant of all kind of Arts, they have not the address of fishing; with Bows and Arrows, they kill Birds and Beasts upon which they feed and live; they own the <HI>Turks</HI> for their Ma∣sters against their will. This lake is in the Kingdom of <HI>Bamagasso,</HI> which was lately conquered and taken from the Great <HI>Neguz,</HI> the people retain some Reliques of Christianity, but with that igno∣rance, that one can scarce distin∣guish them from the Heathens, unless it be by the name, up and down the Country some sorry houses are erected, fitter for wild beasts than men. The walls are of mud and stones, the roofs of a
<PB N="18" REF="133"/>
sort of slender Cane and Reeds which grow near the water side, and in low places, the middle of it is supported by a Pillar of wood that stands in the huts, and keeps the whole Fabrick from falling to the ground, for this miserable peo∣ple are not acquainted with the Art of Architecture. The Towns are composed of this sort of dwel∣lings, there are not many of them, but those that are, have chosen the best Land for their scituations near some fresh waters or lakes; for unless it be in these places the ground is parched up all the year long, but during the time of the Rains. In <HI>Egypt</HI> they never fall, but in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> they are very ex∣traordinary about the month of <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February.</HI> Such vio∣lent showers do pour down, that no creature is able to abide with∣out a shelter, several parties of
<PB N="19" REF="133"/>
the <HI>Turks</HI> Army were stragling up and down, but the main body was at the lake <HI>Gueresh.</HI> When we came up to them they were com∣posed of Horse and Foot about six thousand, not able to abide a a combat with the Abyssins; there∣fore they thought upon nothing else than a safe retreat. They had plundred the Country people that were yet subject to <HI>Prester John,</HI> and had carryed men, wo∣men and children into captivity. A sad sight it was unto us that were Christians, to behold our brethren and our Christian name so miserably abused by the enemy of Christ, our <HI>Abuna</HI> could not refrain from tears, he laboured to relieve some of them, and to com∣fort them in their affliction, but for fear of discovering himself, he was not willing to express too much grief or kindness to them. The
<PB N="20" REF="134"/>
Embassadours credit saved us from all affronts, we lodged two nights with them; for during that time they expected the coming up of some Troups that were sent to pillage. It is the custom of the people that border upon the A∣byssins, once a year to visit their Territories, for they meet with a considerable deal of plunder with little or no hazard. The Abyssins are more superstitious than war∣like, they have been renowned for Valour, but at present they are Cowards, they suffer every petty Nation that is daring to destroy their borders, which is the fault chiefly of their Governors; for having so much Riches as they have, so many Mines of Gold, and other considerable Commo∣dities, they might allow a part to some war-like people to fight un∣der their banners, and assist them
<PB N="21" REF="134"/>
against their troublesome Neigh∣bours. At present they have little communication with people of their Religion, which if they had, it would be a mighty support to them and their interest; When the <HI>Portugueses</HI> were sent with an unconsiderable party into those Dominions, the <HI>Abyssin</HI> Empe∣rour felt the benefit of forrein succours, for the enemy was bea∣ten in two battels, and forc'd to yield to the Christian Valour. Amongst the Prisoners several Noblemens children were seen, who by their Meen and Garb were distinguishable from the or∣dinary sort. These poor creatures were led to be sold in <HI>Turky</HI> and other places as beasts, and the worst is, they were to be forced to renounce their Religion. What a grief was it to their Christian Parents, to suffer such a loss, to
<PB N="22" REF="135"/>
have their Sons and Daughters a∣mongst the Infidels? This in∣conveniency might be prevented, did these In-land Christians keep a strong Guard upon their con∣fines, or with a stout resolution labour to drive these Robbers far from their habitations, or labour to revenge themselves, by carry∣ing the War into their own Land, or by seizing on the Sea coast, and the passages of the mountains that limit their Country, where they might place such strong Castles and numerous Guards as might keep the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> from all such attempts: But when we have fully taken a view of <HI>Abassia</HI> or <HI>Aethiopia</HI> Superiour, and of the Emperour and Go∣vernment, we may be better able to see the cause of these disorders that happen almost every year in some corner of the Land. Having
<PB N="23" REF="135"/>
therefore spent some days in the view of our Christian brethren that were led into Captivity, we took our leave of them and of the <HI>Turks</HI> Army, and marched on our journey towards a large Town of the Kingdom of <HI>Tigremahon</HI> called <HI>Bashaw▪</HI> it lies beyond a large Ri∣ver that runs through <HI>Africa,</HI> it receives the tribute from other small Rivers, and then it runs through many Countreys until it discharges it self into <HI>Nilus,</HI> the people of the Country call it in their language <HI>Togassi</HI> and others <HI>Guekrahock.</HI> Were it not for this River, it were not possible to sub∣sist in this In-land Country, but it divides it self into so many bran∣ches, and waters so large a Terri∣tory, that no part of the Empe∣rours Country is without some benefit that it brings unto it. The Country round about did hear
<PB N="24" REF="136"/>
the Marches of the enemies rage and fury, the Towns were burnt to the ground, the people either fled or carryed into captivity, the land and trees were not spared in some places, for they had cut down a great quantity to facili∣tate their passages over some Ri∣vers. Here we came into a Coun∣try far more fruitful than any o∣ther I had seen in <HI>Africa,</HI> it was capable of more improvement; did the Inhabitants skill and in∣dustry answer the goodness of the soil, I do not find but this part might bear as excellent Fruits as any other place of the world. The heat of the climate quickens na∣ture in the production of all Ve∣getatives, so that it is blessed with two Springs every year, or at least with two Crops of every thing that is sown or planted, un∣less it be in those places that
<PB N="25" REF="136"/>
want the benefit of water; we met here with some flying parts of the <HI>Turks</HI> Army riding apace after the main body, for they were pursued by several troops of the <HI>Abyssins.</HI> Those thieves had adventured almost near the Im∣perial Tents without resistance, not without considerable plunder able to reward them for their labours; we proceeded on our way about two leagues before we came to meet with the inhabitants of the Country, the first were a party of horse-men very well mounted pursuing their enemies, they complained unto the Embas∣sadour of the <HI>Turks</HI> violences, we were afraid that they would have violated the Law of Nations upon him, they received us with that rage; the presence of the <HI>Abuna</HI> hindred them from offering injury to his Person; Him they received

with all expressions of honour and kindness, and suffered some of them to return back to guard him, the rest continued on their way. They overtook the <HI>Turks</HI> at the ford of a little River very busie to get over their Captives and Goods, we heard that they fell upon them with a wonderful fu∣ry and recovered much of the spoils, killing great numbers of them. They returned afterwards in triumph with much honour, ha∣ving so successefully encountred with their enemies. In the mean whiles we proceeded in our jour∣ney towards the Emperour of <HI>A∣bassia,</HI> who hearing of the <HI>Abuna</HI>'s arrival, sent some of his Court to Complement him and bid him welcome; where ever he passed the Clergy &amp; people came to receive him with more signs of kind∣ness than pomp, the processions
<PB N="27" REF="137"/>
of the people came to meet us at the entrance of the towns, and when we came within sight of the Emperours tents, he sent all the Court to receive the <HI>Abuna.</HI> I did carefully observe all the cere∣monies of Reception and Instal∣ment. The <HI>Abuna</HI> as soon as he came within the tents, went to kiss the Emperours Girdle. He was standing in a stately tent e∣rected in the middle of the rest, about it was a large place much like to a Market, where the Courtiers are accustomed to walk, at the right hand is another very beautiful, where the Emperours Wives and Concubines dwell; at the top of the Princes tent is a Golden Cross with an Angel holding it in his left hand, with a drawn Cymeter in the right. The <HI>Abuna</HI> went to change his habit and put on another, according to
<PB N="28" REF="138"/>
the <HI>Abyssin</HI> custom. It is a very singular one, none but the High-Priest hath the liberty to wear it, for it is the badge or character by which he is distinguished from the other <HI>Papa</HI>'s or Bishops of that Country, and from the rest of the Clergy, he was conducted next, to pay his respects to the Empe∣rour, he was in the Kingdom of <HI>Beleguaze</HI> near a town very well peopled and scituated in a plea∣sant plain called <HI>Ikroah,</HI> about six leagues distant from the River <HI>Tagassi,</HI> I had the satisfaction to accompany the <HI>Abuna,</HI> for he was a man of a very mild and kind spirit, very pleasant in company, yet grave and serious, he was led by the Master of the Ceremonies into the Inner room where the Emperour lay upon a curious Bed of White Cotton Bed with a large fringe of Gold, behind him
<PB N="29" REF="138"/>
stood his naked Sword, and round about were the Lords of his Pri∣vy Councel; above was a Canopy of cloath of Gold, with green silk interwoven, the room it self was hung with the same stuffe; as∣soon as the <HI>Abuna</HI> enter'd the room he kneel'd three times on the ground, and then ascended the steps to the Bed to perform his respects; In the mean whiles the Emperour rose from his couch and half up embraced the <HI>Abuna,</HI> wish∣ing him much felicity in his Em∣pire, they discoursed some time together, and then he was dismist with all honour and civility; the Emperour was pleased to take no∣tice of his retinue, and particular∣ly of my self. I was also admitted to the honour of kissing his Gir∣dle, a ceremony only due to the Prince. I followed the <HI>Abuna,</HI> who received me into his own
<PB N="30" REF="139"/>
lodgings, and would not suffer me whiles I was in that Country to be obliged to any other place for my retreat. Now I have brought my Reader into the Imperial tents of <HI>Abassia,</HI> it is convenient that we should take a view as from a high place of all the inferiour orders of men, and of all particulars which his curiosity may be inquisitive.

<HEAD>Of the Emperour.</HEAD>
<P>THe Emperour of the <HI>Abys∣sins</HI> is a Prince highly hono∣red of his subjects, because they fancy him to be lineally descend∣ed from that noble and Religious King that first planted the Chri∣stian Religion amongst them; and as they are extreamly devoted to it; so much, that they appear al∣most extravagant in many of their
<PB N="31" REF="139"/>
practises, they have no small re∣spect to his Posterity, who first brought them the advantage of the Christian Faith. None hath access to him of his subjects unless it be upon solemn occasions, but the chief Officers of his Crown, when he rides or is carryed abroad in a Royal Throne, all his people fall upon their knees and adore him; this throne is a kind of Se∣dan, but far more stately, with steps ascending to it made of wood gilt over, covered with Gold, it is carryed upon mens shoulders, or between four Horses, the Empe∣rour appears in it with much state, and with more glory than in any o∣ther thing that I have seen; He never stirs out of his tents, but 600 men do follow him at his heels, they are his daily guard, they wear a Livery and a Habit distinct from all other people, on
<PB N="32" REF="140"/>
their head a Scarlet bonnet with three white plumes fastned be∣hind with a blew cross on their shoulders, they have a very con∣venient Coat that comes down to their middle, with a Girdle or Sash, over it a Roman Mantle hangs, more proper for State than action; the colour is green, it is not very long, nor troublesome when they are obliged to make use of their hands; sometimes they ride, sometimes they go a∣foot, as the Emperours occasion requires; for that purpose he hath always ready in his Stables great numbers of Horses. The Empe∣rours Person is whiter than any of his Kingdom, for the <HI>Abyssins</HI> are tawny, a colour drawing near to black. I never saw any others of his Relations or kindred, but I hear they are all of the same co∣lour. The people interpret this
<PB N="33" REF="140"/>
to his advantage, that God by this distinction, hath singled out that Family that is to Reign amongst them, out of which they always chuse their Emperour; their cu∣stom is, that he should never mar∣ry until he be crowned; then, with the consent of his Nobles he chu∣seth two Wives out of his King∣dom, he entertains besides as ma∣ny Concubines as he pleaseth. They are always with him in his tents with all their Attendants. The first Male-child usually suc∣ceeds the Father in his Kingdom. Assoon as the children are named, they are carryed to a very delici∣ous place in the middle of a large mountain called <HI>Amarak,</HI> where a stately Castle is built encom∣passed with the River <HI>Borohr,</HI> and fortified with a strong wall. There they are kept with the o∣ther precious things belonging to
<PB N="34" REF="141"/>
the Emperour, they never go out unless it be in the Gardens and places of Recreation, with which this territory is abundantly fur∣nished; and then they never loose the sight of their governours and guard; when the Father is dead the chief Officers of the Empire come to this place, and unless the eldest be uncapable of the honour, they take him to succeed in his Fathers room. If there be no Sons, the eldest Daughter takes the Scepter. During their Fathers life, they are kept here as in a <HI>Se∣raglio,</HI> to learn all exercises proper to their Sex and age. They are taught the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> tongues, humane Philosophy and the Principles of Christian Reli∣gion. Here is for that purpose a large Library of above ten thou∣sand Volums all in Manuscripts, some told me that they had there
<PB N="35" REF="141"/>
the most ancient Books of the world written by the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Sages in the time of <HI>Moses,</HI> by <HI>Phaenicians</HI> afterwards, and by the Learned of all Ages. I saw some in the Library (into which I had the leave to enter) that were made of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> leaf called <HI>Papy∣rus,</HI> and others made of old Parchment that did bear the marks of antiquity. I ask'd the <HI>Subdi</HI> an Officer that led me in to see the curiosities, how they did to preserve the Books so many years from consuming, he told me that they do usually transcribe them when the leaves are worn or likely to decay, and that for that intent there are twenty three Persons appointed with a good maintenance for them by the for∣mer Emperours; their imploy∣ment is only to transcribe and co∣py out the books that age threa∣tens
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>
to spoil; they have not the excellent use of Printing, for want of communication with their <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> brethren. Hither are also sent the chief Noblemens sons of the Empire to keep company with the Royal bloud, and to receive with them the instructions which this place only affords, for here is maintained a Learned Bishop with: several inferiour Priests that have the charge of instructing and tutering the Children that are committed to their custody. The Bishop is Governor of the Castle, and Overseer of the Diocess o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kingdom of <HI>Amara;</HI> here is his Pa∣lace and place of abode, he sel∣dom stirs to Court. The Empe∣rour visits this place oncea year with his Wives. When he is cho∣sen, then all his brethren accom∣pany him to his Coronation; a great solemnity in this place as well
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>
as amongst our Christian Princes; afterwards the Males are sent to govern Provinces, the Maids are disposed of in Mariage to Noble∣men, who commonly expect this time as an opportunity to advance themselves by such an alliance. The Emperour is first crowned with thorns before he puts on the Imperial Diadem, in imitation of our Saviour, or to express the troublesome employment that he is to undertake. The <HI>Abuna</HI> puts both upon his head, in the place appointed for the devotions of the people, in the presence of all the Nobility of the Country. At that time the Prisons are opened, a thousand slaves are released at the Emperours charge, and the poor are relieved, actions that be∣come a Christian Emperour, be∣sides a great Feast is kept several days with all the splendor that
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>
becomes so great a Prince, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> large a Fortune and great Reve∣nue. The present Emperou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name is <HI>Abraham,</HI> he is a young man about thirty years of age, his Meen is comely and pleasant, his body is streight and tall, the fea∣tures of his face are very wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proportioned; so that he passet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a great Beauty amongst them his eyes are quick and large, he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much delighted with the sport o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hunting the wild Beasts, for tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> intent he keeps excellent Horse and great Mastives that are fetch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of <HI>Indostan</HI> and <HI>Arabia;</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chief Officers that are near his Person, are his <HI>Bishur,</HI> the Lieute∣nant General of his Armies; the <HI>Zoroah,</HI> the Treasurer and super∣intendant of his revenues; the <HI>Bikir,</HI> the grand Marshal of the Kingdom who is also the su∣pream Judge of Affairs of conse∣quence;
<PB N="39" REF="23"/>
the <HI>Huloh,</HI> the Secretary of State; <HI>Diriharvah Neguz,</HI> the Captain of the Guard, or preser∣ver of the great Emperours Per∣son; <HI>Satyrhab</HI> is the Chamberlain of his Houshold; the <HI>Grashun</HI> is the keeper of his Horses; several o∣ther Officers are in his Court, whose names I omit; when they come to their Emperour they bow their knee three times to the ground. The Embassadours of the Infidels do never receive the honour of speaking to him, but they are dealt with by the media∣tion of some appointed for that purpose. The <HI>Abuna</HI> is much respected at Court; what he speaks, is received by all as a Law. The former Emperour was a man of War, but this is a Peace-maker to his own prejudice, and that of his Subjects. He hath this good quality, that he is severe against
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>
all vices, against Swearing and Drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He is fitter to sit upon a peaceable Throne than to govern one that hath so many watchful enemies about it as his hath. He is very inquisitive into all Affairs, he suffers none to be dispatcht without his knowledge. He is not easily over-ruled by Councel, but sticks fast to his own opinion and resolution, sometimes to his prejudice; he is very Religi∣ous, and a great observer of the Ceremonies of his Church, ha∣ting all things that appear with the face of Innovation; by this means it happens that all about him look so serious in their Reli∣gious duties, and shew less pro∣faness in their Practises, their Princes example encourages them. If any be named debauch'd, he is certain to be disgrac'd as soon as the fame hath reach'd his
<PB N="41" REF="24" MS="y"/>
Masters ear. A great favourite of the Emperour, one that attend∣ed on him continually, was su∣spected to have some familiarity with anothers Wife, the suspici∣on was blown by some envious persons into the Emperours ear, who presently sent for him, and dismissed him his service. This good severity causeth his Laws to be well obeyed. Did this Emperour know as well how to deal with his enemies, as he doth know how to govern his Subjects, he would be as much feared a∣broad as he is reverenced at home, and all his Neighbours would stand in aw of him. I doubt not but the Empire of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> would be again restored to its former Greatness, could he but as well manage a Sword as a Scepter. But that weakness is to be attributed to the manner and place of his
<PB N="42" REF="25" MS="y"/>
Education, he hath been shut with∣in the narrow limits of a little Territory unto which he did con∣fine his ambition when he was produced in the world; his larger fortune did not increase his pre∣tentions, but being content to what he then enjoyed, the increase was look'd upon as a super fluity, besides this manner of Education weakens the spirits that should have a compass and a larger scope to act than a narrow mountain or a small Territory. He was there so accustomed to a Pedantick life, that he knew not how to handle the helm of State, and act supream in the business of the Empire. His Governours I conceive did so domineer over him, as it is their custom, that he was ignorant in any other thing but how to obey. As therefore our Countryman <HI>Machiavel</HI> wisely advises, let the
<PB N="43" REF="25"/>
Prince that is to succeed his Fa∣ther be nursed up in the Camp, and in the midst of business a∣mongst men of courage and reso∣lution, that he may take impres∣sions sutable to the employment he is to have in the world; for were a Prince to judge of a propo∣sition of Divinity, or to compose a piece of Latine or Greek, I would then shut in the wandring thoughts of his youth, and not suffer them to see the world a∣broad: but seeing he is to com∣mand men, rather than Schollars; and to compose those Affairs up∣on which depend his Subjects quiet and happiness, I think it is wisdom to train him up according∣ly, and let him see the face of Souldiers as well as of Pedants, a Gun and a Sword as well as Books, that he may not only be a Master, but a King. My business
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>
is not to enlarge upon the manner of Education proper to a Prince, only I take notice of the defaults I have mark'd in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> in the bringing up their young Nobility, and the Person that is to wear the Crown, that if these Memoirs have the happiness to fall into the hands of any of our Princes of <HI>I∣taly,</HI> they may not make their Children so bookish that they may not be able to handle a Sword. This present Emperour of <HI>Ethio∣pia</HI> is the most Learned of all his Dominions, he speaks <HI>Arabick, Persian, Hebrew,</HI> and many other Languages; he is read in Philo∣sophy, in Astrology: He is fitter for contemplation than for action.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Imperial Court.</HEAD>
<P>UNder so Religious and Learned a Prince we may look for Courtiers of the same temper, for although some may follow their inclinations, it is com∣mon to see them frame themselves according to their Princes will and disposition. Never any Court was better modelled. <HI>Solomon</HI> from whom this Emperour gives out to have derived his Pedigree, did never order his Houshold in a more excellent manner. Every Officer is to be dil igentin his place, if any be careless or cor∣rupt, the <HI>She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous,</HI> the Comp∣trolers and Officers appointed to take notice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all misdemeanours; lesser offences are punished with the discredit of losing the place, greater with imprisonment and
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>
loss of Estate and life. The <HI>Ne∣guz</HI> himself is so severe, that late∣ly at the request of his Mother he would not pardon a murderer, one of his Attendants, when he had killed a child of an Inferi∣our birth and Parentage, but cau∣sed him to be forthwith banished out of his Territories.</P>
<P>Besides the Bishops that wait upon the Court, here are ten Chaplains, Ministers of the Infe∣riour Orders of the Clergy, who do on the Sabbath day expound before the Emperour in their turns, some Text of Scripture ac∣cording to the ancient manner of the <HI>Jews</HI> who had their Synago∣gues, where the Law was read and explained to the people every week. The Saturday is the day appointed in this place for publick Devotion. The manner ob∣served at that time, I shall set
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
down in its place; all Orders of men do resort to their Churches to assist in the service of God.</P>
<P>In the Court are entertained all the Princes sons that have any dependency upon this Empire; when they come of age whiles they are young, they are kept in the Castle of <HI>Amara,</HI> and there brought up with the young Em∣peror; a policy not unuseful to this State, for by this means they are taught be time to know and re∣spect their future Prince, and when they are of age to manage and govern the Affairs of their several jurisdictions; they are more faithful to his interest, for whom they have had a kindess from their Infancy, for nothing nourishes love so much as an early acquaintance; and nothing lays a better foundation to a sincere friendship and loyalty, as a fami∣liarity
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
from their tender years. They are there taught to honour and respect the Emperours Chil∣dren, and he is also obliged to a loving correspondency with them. But assoon as they come of age, the Emperor calls them to Court, and there they are further in∣structed and tutored before he commits unto them their Fathers Estates and Kingdoms. This ob∣liges also the Parents to stick close to the Emperour, for their sons are as pledges in His Court of their fidelity and obedience.</P>
<P>The Emperour is not to dwell in any house, nor to make any long residence in any Town, for they look upon it as beneath his Gran∣deur to be confined within the Walls of any habitation; and they judge it not consistant with the benefit of the publick, that one place should constantly enjoy
<PB N="49" REF="28"/>
him; therefore it is provided by the Statute Law of that Nation, that the Prince shall never stay a∣bove four days in any Town, for that reason, when he hath been beaten by his Neighbours, he shut not up himself in Cities or Fortresses, but saved himself into the remotest and Desart places, where none did offer to seek him out, or to adventure themselves but the wild beasts. The people of the Country that hold from him all their Lands and Tene∣ments, do never suffer him to be long in that distress, but they flock about him out of a fear to lose the right or privileges of his pro∣tection; so that if he loseth one battel and his people be destroyed whiles there are any remaining in the Land, he is able to make a head against the enemy, for all are obliged in such cases to appear in
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
Arms from sixteen years old to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sixty, unless sickness doth furnis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them with any reasonable excuse.</P>
<P>There is one practice remarka∣ble in this Court, every morning<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the Officers of the <HI>Neguz</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pay their respects unto him abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eight a clock, not to his Person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but to something that represent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it. In the Anti-Chamber of the Emperour is a couch of Stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> standing under a glorious Canopy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon three steps above the couch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is a Golden Scepter richly set with precious Stones and Pearls, it commonly leans against the hanging of the room. Before this empty seat are always waiters to observe all that omit to pay their daily homage. It is the duty of every one to present himself, and kneel three times to the ground before it every morning whether the Emperour be there or not.
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>
The <HI>Abyssins</HI> never stir their hats, nor discover their heads, but in the Churches at their devoti∣ons, then they observe the pra∣ctice of all other Christians. Les∣ser civilities are paid only with a bow of the body, and an inclinati∣on of the head, holding the right hand close to the breast; greater respects are expressed with the bow of the knee, the kissing of the girdle or the thigh, and of the ground upon which the person that we intend to honour walks.</P>
<P>Women are rarely seen a∣mongst the men at Court, they have a private place unto which none is admitted but the <HI>Abuna,</HI> and some of the most Religious Persons. They have Eunuchs that wait upon them, usually Blacks, they appear at the Churches, but in a place separated from the rest. Sometimes when the Emperour
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>
will shew his Grandeur and hap∣piness to his Courtiers, he sends for his Chief Queen, who must appear in all the State and Glory that her Industry or Beauty can produce, she is received by the Emperour with some expressions of kindness, and then she is ad∣mitted to sit down on his right hand, for the left is the place of honour in <HI>Abassia.</HI></P>
<P>Once every year he hath a great Feast kept at Court, with wonderful expressions of joy, it is the day of the Emperours Birth. It is the custom that the <HI>Neguz</HI> should give entertainment to all that will be pleased to accept of his kindness, he is the next day after requited with Presents of the most considerable Persons of his Court.</P>
<P>This Imperial Court is never fixed in any one place, but Mar∣ches
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>
with the Emperour, about 6000 Tents do always pitch a∣bout him, in such an excellent order, that in a moment, from the farthermost tent one may come to that of the great <HI>Neguz,</HI> where a strong guard watches about his Person day and night. The Soul∣diers of the Kings guard are very neatly attired, and well furnished with Bows and Guns; they are mixed at present, since the use of Powder was introduced amongst them by the <HI>Portugueses.</HI></P>

Many Titles and King∣doms are heapt together to ex∣press his Grandeur; at present he enjoys but the Titles alone of
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>
many of those Kingdoms, whiles others do eat up the reversion, eleven or twelve of them do re∣main faithful to him, sometimes the Inhabitants are disturbed by their war-like Neighbours, but they could never be subdued by any other Prince, for his sake they endure the loss of their Goods, Estates, Children, and oft times they are driven into extream Po∣verty, because they cannot leave their lawful Prince; but they must also renounce Religion with him before they can be accepted of by their enemies.</P>
<P>This consideration ties them fast to the <HI>Neguz</HI> interest, and obliges them to be most faithful unto him notwithstanding all their losses.</P>
<P>The Government of this Great Prince is partly Arbitrary, and partly Subject to the written
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>
Laws that are contained in two Volums, written as they say by the Apostles themselves. The first they call <HI>Manida,</HI> the other they name <HI>Abethilis,</HI> they comprehend the Rules of Government, rela∣ting to right or wrong; they fur∣ther observe much of the politick Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> which he command∣ed the <HI>Jews.</HI> In those other oc∣casions of which these Books are silent, the Emperours or the Judges pleasure and reason passeth for a Law. The first Books called <HI>Manida</HI> and <HI>Abethil,</HI> are full of most excellent Rules and Statutes. Some wise man of that Empire composed them for to direct the Prince in the execution of his Of∣fice: and that they might receive more credit, he caused it to be bruited abroad, that these books had been found in the ruines of the Church where St. <HI>Lycanon,</HI> who
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>
was sent into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> by St. <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> the Apostle, did teach and that they had been composed by the Disciples of our Saviour assem∣bled together in a general Coun∣cel. Assoon as this religious lye had been divulged, every one was desirous to see and hear the Con∣tents of this Book, when they saw therefore that the matter was an∣swerable to the fame of it, they began really to credit it, so that they do as religiously obey the commands of these Books as the Gospels, and the word of God. When the Emperour dines or sups, some small portion of it is read before him after the Musick, which in this country is very plea∣sant and grateful to the ear, more than in any other place out of <HI>I∣taly,</HI> although the instruments upon which they play be not like ours.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="33"/>The Emperour hath one Judge called <HI>Bikir</HI> over all his domini∣ons, to judge of matters of right or wrong, under him are the <HI>Sudh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣drie</HI>'s, provincial Judges that are to give up an account of their actions to him, they are often removed at the least complaint, and others placed in their rooms. It is a great disgrace to receive a bribe, they all do follow the dictates of reason in pronouncing their sentences, in proportioning the penalties accor∣ding to the nature and hainous∣ness of the offences. These Judges have only a power over the peo∣ple, the Clergy and Monks have other Officers and Superinten∣dants that do judge of their mat∣ters.</P>
<P>Besides these inferiour Judges, every other year the grand Mar∣shal or Supream <HI>Bikir</HI> sends men into several Provinces to hearken
<PB N="60" REF="34"/>
after the behaviour, and examine the deportment of the Judges. If any be found guilty of any crime, he is severely punished and shamefully thrust out of his Of∣fice with a mark of Infamy, that renders him incapable of having any publick employment in this Country. Such seldom remain there long, for the shame and ob∣loquy of the people forces them to be gone and seek other habita∣tions in a remote Country. The <HI>Bikir</HI> hath also his Lieutenants, like unto our Colonels, disposed of in all the dominions of grand <HI>Neguz,</HI> each Lieutenant gives him account of all the men he is able to provide for the service of the Prince in case of necessity, and he governs the people, keeps all things in order, assists the <HI>Bikir</HI> and all his inferiour Officers in the execution of their Offices, when

they are requir'd; for that purpose, they have so many men ready upon all occasions to obey their orders; these receive a continual salary from the Emperour, al∣though they are otherwise em∣ployed in several Trades. At the least summons they assemble at the Rendezvous, and follow their Leaders, who by this means keep all the Country in awe, and appease the tumults and disorders that may happen amongst a mix∣ed multitude.</P>
<P>In the time of the Wars, these Lieutenants of distinct places ga∣ther their men together at the place appointed, and then march with them according to order, u∣sually to the place where the great <HI>Neguz</HI> is himself, to guard and de∣fend his Person. They carry with them their Provisions and Victu∣als proportionable to the time
<PB N="62" REF="35"/>
appointed for them to stay in Arms. These officers have places allotted to them for their mainte∣nance by the Emperour, who is Lord and sole owner of all the Land within his great Empire. All the people are but his slaves, their substance and goods are his when he will require them; unto persons more eminent than the rest he appoints certain Lands and pla∣ces for to recompence them for the pains they take in his service. All the people pay the tenth part of all fruits to the King, that Re∣venue belongs to the Crown: they always pay the tribute and taxes in the Commodities of the Coun∣try, in Salt, Gold, Silver, Corn, Hides, Elephants Teeth, the horn of the <HI>Rhinocerot,</HI> slaves and such like.</P>
<P>Now this manner of Govern∣ment is only in the Territories,
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>
more immediately subject to the <HI>Neguz,</HI> the others, where tributary Kings do Reign, are not thus sub∣ject to his power, the Kings give no account of their actions to him, or to his Officers, but play the soveraigns in all their jurisdictions, causing money to be stamp'd in their names, tributes and customs to be levyed according to the publick wants, disposing of all of∣fices and places within their ter∣ritories at their will.</P>
<P>Of late they have brought in stamped Coin, which before was not known in this Empire. The name and titles of the <HI>Neguez</HI> is Printed in one side, and a large Cross on the other, with some Characters signifying that he is a defender of the Cross. There are yet some little pieces of Gold, Brass and Iron, with Pepper, and all other Merchandises, that serve
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>
instead of Coin in the places far from the Imperial Court, and where Coin cannot so easily be obtained nor made. Those that are found guilty of crimes, are not ordinarily punished with death (they use to deprive them for their offences of some of their Limbs) of their eyes, hands, or feet, forcing them to a continual sufferance the rest of their days. If any commit sacriledge, he is burnt without mercy in the fire; and those that murder, by their Law are to lose their lives, unless the Prince will mitigate the pu∣nishment by a perpetual prison or banishment.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Manda</HI> are several penal Statutes, amongst the rest, that if a Priest be guilty of any crime, as of murder, of perjury, adultery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he is to be punished in the same manner as the rest of the
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>
people, that he is to be called be∣fore the common Judge after that the Bishop hath notice of the fact, and that both together are to pro∣nounce the sentence that he de∣serves without any mercy.</P>
<P>It is commanded in that book, that all, both Secular and Eccle∣siastick persons are to abstain from all carnal Copulation during the space of twenty four hours next immediately before they enter in∣to the Churches.</P>
<P>There is in it a very wholsome Law that concerns the good of the publick: It is that two times every year there shall be an As∣sembly called of the most Reve∣rend and Eminent Persons of the Nation to consult of the Affairs of the Church, and establish Laws according to the occasions and times. That then the <HI>Abuna</HI> shall sit as President with the Empe∣rours
<PB N="66" REF="37"/>
chief Judge, and that of the Clergy and Fryers, there shall be called out of all parts to make Decrees for the good of the Em∣pire.</P>
<P>Adulterers are punished with death in this manner. The Man and the Woman are stript naked and ty'd up by the legs to some high tree, where they are to re∣main to feed the Fowl of the air, until their bones and flesh fall to the ground. It is no less than death to touch them, or to offer to shew favour to their dead Car∣kasses. By this exemplary punish∣ment of these offenders, men grow more wary how they ven∣ture to defile their Neighbours Bed, and Women are not so free of their Tailes as amongst our jealous <HI>Italians.</HI> Men in this Coun∣try pretend not so much Court∣ship and Gallantry, and Women
<PB N="67" REF="37"/>
dare not countenance the declara∣tions or passion of a secret Lover. Custom here teaches women as much privacy as in any other place, but not with that strictness that might render them ridicu∣lous, but they abuse it not as other people do, the better to hide their foul actions, and the meet∣ings of their Gallants. There is more innocency in the behaviour of the women; as much modesty, but less craft and subtilty; as much freedom, but little debauchery.</P>
<P>Murder is no less hateful in this place, it hath a punishment allot∣ted to it no less grievous: The murderer that knew how to de∣stroy others, is forced to destroy himself also; in this manner a Sword is put into his hands, and he is laid upon a large piece of I∣ron flat, as long and as broad as a mans body, it is supported with
<PB N="68" REF="38"/>
four feet under it, a gentle flame is entertained that heats it, and puts him by degrees to cruel tor∣ments, the pain &amp; rage forces him to thrust the weapon into his own bowels, by that means to deliver himself from the unmerciful fury of the fire, and abridge his tor∣tures. This kind of death is pra∣ctised in <HI>Tigremahon</HI> and <HI>Angote,</HI> in other places, the murder is exe∣cuted in another manner, they flea him alive, and cut his eye lids, and then they expose him to the Sun in that raw condition in some e∣minent place, rubbing him over with honey to invite the Bees and Wasps to feed upon him. This kind of death is the most inhu∣mane that I ever beheld. The pain is both grievous and tedious, death creeps upon them by de∣grees, and suffers them not to die till they have endured a world of misery.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="38"/>The Noblemen and Grandees of the Court that offend the <HI>Ne∣guz,</HI> or commit any other crime worthy of death, are not executed in the common manner, nor in the usual places appointed for that purpose. There is in the King∣dom of <HI>Damut</HI> a high Mountain naturally well fortified with a steep ridge of hills on every side, a narrow passage leads up to the top, where a Castle is erected kept by the Souldiers of the <HI>Ne∣guz</HI> guard. There all noble men are brought that venture to break the Laws of the Land, or to displease their Soveraign Lord. The Ter∣ritorie round about is very bar∣ren, and the place extream cold most part of the year; whether it be the nature of the Soil, or the elevation of the Mountain into the second Region of the Air, none could tell me, but here these Per∣sons
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>
of Quality are famished to death, imprisoned, and put to suffer several other sorts of pu∣ments according to the pleasure of the <HI>Neguz.</HI> This place is very convenient for that purpose, for the Friends and Acquaintance of the offenders cannot come to learn the miseries that they endure, nor the cruelties that they suffer; which if they did know, might oblige them to a revenge, or ill will against their Emperours.</P>

<HEAD>Of several Customs of the Abyssins.</HEAD>
<P>THe Emperour and people have so great a respect for the Churches, that they never ride by them upon their Horses, as soon as they come within a hun∣dred paces, they alight and walk a foot bowing at the publick pla∣ces
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>
of their Devotion, in honour of that great God that hath na∣med them his Houses of Prayer, as they pass by.</P>
<P>When the Emperour makes a∣ny progress far from the usual place of Residence, certain Reli∣gious men do carry before him up∣on their shoulders, a banner with some pious representation in it, with an Altar or Table of Stone, upon which they use to Celebeate their Communion, before them marcheth a fellow with a Censer in one hand, and a little Bell in the other, at the sound of it the horse∣men come down, the people stand by, and all do prepare themselves to let their Prince pass.</P>
<P>They never use to send their thoughts one to another in wri∣ting, but by messengers, either out of ignorance or superstition, for they fancy the use of writing so
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>
sacred, that they will not profane it in ordinary business, because God hath been pleased to commit his Holy Word in writing; yet of late, seeing the inconveniencies their scrupulous fancies have re∣duced them to, they have made use of writing in several occasions, as in Registring the Affairs of the Kingdoms, in setting down the expences, disbursements and Re∣ceits of the Emperours Revenues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the characters are di∣stinct from those of the Bible, or of their Sacred Books. And when the Emperour sends an Embassa∣dour, he then dispatches with him some Credential Letters.</P>
<P>They are not to make Wine but by stealth, none but the <HI>Abu∣na</HI> and the King may cause the Grapes to be strained; for they are afraid that if Wine did grow common, it would introduce much
<PB N="73" REF="40"/>
debauchery and many disorders, which could not find a remedy. They do not forbid it out of su∣perstition as the <HI>Turks,</HI> but for some politick considerations that Wine may not grow so common amongst them, that they might neglect the other drinks which en∣courage Husbandry, for they use a sort of drink made of a leaf which they sow, it is of a pleasant taste, much like unto old <HI>Mede,</HI> a drink made of Honey. They drink also water steeped with Barley, &amp; other Grains. The Emperour and the <HI>Abuna</HI> have liberty to drink and make Wine by their Laws. All the Wine of this Country is very black, but a great Cordial, it burns not so much the stomach as others do in hot places, but che∣risheth and refresheth the body.</P>
<P>The towns in this Country are not numerous, in Houses they sel∣dom
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
contain above 2000. I never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw a walled City, some Castles of late have been built for plea∣sure rather than for defence.</P>
<P>Their houses are but mean and low, covered with a thick thatch, their beds are Hides tied up at the four corners. They eat upon cou∣ches, with a little round and low table placed before them that sup∣ports a large dish; they have some Vessels made of earth of a shining black very beautiful, these are their cups to drink; of late they have the use of Gold and Silver in their houses.</P>
<P>They have several sorts of weapons, short Lances, Swords, Bows and Arrows without Fea∣thers, Helmets and Head-pieces; they have got some field Guns purchased from Merchants at an extraordinary rate, to encourage them to import more.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="41"/>The <HI>Abyssins</HI> are natural lyars and deceivers, they seldom speak truth when they swear, unless they be brought to take a solemn Oath, or be forced to swear by the Head of their <HI>Neguz,</HI> or be scared with the thoughts of Excommu∣nication, for they apprehend that above all corporal punishments.</P>
<P>This is their manner of admini∣string an Oath, the party that is to swear follows two Priests to the Church-door, they carry before him Fire and Incense, as soon as the party comes, the Priests cause him to lay his hand on the door, saying unto him these words: <HI>If thou swear an untruth, as the Dra∣gon devoureth the beasts of the For∣rest, so let the infernal Devils de∣vour thee, as the Grapes are bruised in the Wine-press, so let them bruise thy body, and as the fire consumeth the wood, so let thy soul for ever burn</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="42"/>
<HI>in hell.</HI> The party that sweareth answers to every one of these im∣precations <HI>Amen.</HI> But if thou speak the truth, let thy life be pro∣longed with honour, and thy soul at last be received into heaven; and again he answereth <HI>Amen,</HI> which being ended, he tells what he knows of the business required from him.</P>
<P>They have not the liberty to kill an Ox without the Gover∣nours leave, although it belong to them, for they are careful to pre∣serve Cattel in that place from the excess of Luxury; here are no shambles therefore in the towns, as in <HI>Europe;</HI> their ordinary victu∣als are Mutton, Herbs, Fruit, Fowl, wild Beasts, and such like. The wild Goats do increase here in such a manner, especially near the Mountains, that they eat up all the Corn and Grass, other wild
<PB N="77" REF="42"/>
things are here in great numbers; they do not therefore suffer their tame Cattel to be destroyed (whiles they have so many wild, that they threaten the Fruits of the earth with destruction) to en∣courage the hunting of them, they forbid the ordinary use of Beef. This Inland people is naturally of a lazy disposition, they have there∣fore many Laws to quicken them, and oblige them to labour and provide for their own preservati∣on. As the not killing of their Oxen without License, the refu∣sing alms to beggars, they are not to suffer any in the Kingdoms of the <HI>Neguz</HI> that will not work, un∣less they be so sick and maimed, that they are not able to help themselves, then the Religious houses do administer comfort to them, for they are endowed for that purpose with many Lands and Reversions.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="43"/>The <HI>Abyssins</HI> are very devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all holy duties, &amp; in holy places they pay unto them a great re∣spect, they'l neither spit nor sit down in their Churches, nor suffer any Dogs nor Cats, nor any other unreasonable creature to enter into them; but instead of seats, they use Crutches very conveniently made to lean upon. At the Church door there stands a multitude of them, every one takes his own, and draws as near the Preacher as possible he can. They perform their prayers sitting, confess their sins standing, hear the expositions and Lectures of the Bible lean∣ing.</P>
<P>They often use washing, espe∣cially before prayer, they wash face, hands and feet, for they love to appear before Almighty God with decency, they will not touch any unclean or dead thing, and if
<PB N="79" REF="43" MS="y"/>
they do by chance, they dare not present themselves in their Churches till they have made use of washing.</P>
<P>Their women are employed a∣bout all servile work, but are not reduced to that slavery as other women, their Neighbours amongst the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The ordi∣nary work of those that necessity constrains not to be industrious, is to spin Silk and Cotton to make the excellent stuffs that come from thence and the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Their Marriages are very plea∣sant, before the door of the bride∣groom a bed is prepared according to his estate, then come three Priests with a silver Cross which they lay upon it, followed by the Bridegroom, Bride, and all their Friends; they altogether walk three times about the bed, crying Allelujah, and then they com∣mand
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>
the young couple to set down, cutting off a Lock of the head of the Bridegroom, and ano∣ther of the Bride, which they sprinkle in water sanctified, then they tell the Bridegroom, laying their hands upon his head, do that which God hath commanded in his Gospel, and think now that you are not two but one flesh; which is no sooner said, but they all depart, and a tent being erect∣ed about the bed, they presently obey the Commandment. Then follows a three days Feast, where all magnificence is expressed a∣mongst the great ones.</P>
<P><HI>Polygamy</HI> is permitted and much practised amongst them, but those that wait upon their Churches, or that perform any office in them, are by no means suffered to have two Wives, whosoever of the Clergy keepeth a Concubine or
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>
two Wives, is degraded <HI>ipso facto,</HI> and loseth his title to all Spiritual promotion or employment in the Church, thereby they recommend a greater degree of abstinence from fleshly lusts to men of the Holy function, than to others; they require them to live accor∣ding to the strictest rules of Chri∣stianity, and to be exemplary in their conversations.</P>
<P>They have another frequent a∣buse in the matter of Marriage, they do grant unto the woman a Letter of divorce upon slight oc∣casions: But the Priests do not approve of this practice, therefore they provide against it as much as lies in their power; they lay upon that person that shall break first the Marriage-bond a grievous pe∣nalty, or a curse to oblige the par∣ties for fear of being liable unto it, to be faithful and constant to
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>
one another. Nevertheless the great ones many times find se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pretences to excuse their dissoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>¦ty, and to procure a separati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when they do not agree. Among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them it is also lawful to marry the Brothers Wife, if she be Child less according to the Law of <HI>Mo∣ses;</HI> but this is only practised by the Grandees. The other sort of people are more Christian in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> customs, they suffer not any to marry before the age of 18. the reason they give of this Law, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that by early Marriages nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> brought to decay, which they la∣bour to hinder, by appointing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moderate age capable of the trou∣ble and inconveniencies of that estate. They fore-see also that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Marriage were permitted before▪ it would both lessen and weak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the next Generation of men.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="45" MS="y"/>There are here two sorts of Re∣ligious men, the Priests whose business is to reach and instruct the people, whereof some are disper∣sed all over the Country, having their particular precincts; the o∣ther live together in a Fellowship and Society in Buildings appoint∣ed for that purpose; the chief bu∣siness of these is to Visit the sick, provide for the poor, and perform charitable deeds. The other sort of Religious men are Monks and Fryers that live a retired life, as the <HI>Anachorets</HI> did; for that intent they have Covents built at some places distant from the towns, up∣on delicate Mountains, and in plea∣sant Valleys. Neither of these sort of people are useless in that Em∣pire, they are not to beg as our Fryers in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> they have no need of it, for the former Emperours have appointed a con∣siderable
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>
Revenue, and great ter∣ritories to the maintenance of these Houses, and of their owners besides, they have the liberty to traffick and increase their Riches every one hath a trade to employ himself, some spend their life i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Contemplation, and in discovering those things and Secrets that may be for the publick benefit, others do till their own ground, sow, reap and dress their Gardens.</P>
<P>These places were not first founded in vain, they were for the benefit of the publick, e∣specially of Strangers and Pil∣grims that are there to be received and entertained without any charge to them. And if any wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> become an extravagant in wasting his Estate, it was laid up for him in these Religious Houses, and employed to the best advantage by these Fryers. But that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>
Revenue may never be wasted, they are never to marry whiles they remain in the Covent, if the fancy of marrying seizeth upon a∣ny man, he is to depart with a small portion, and to dispose of himself at his own pleasure. These men live such pleasant lives, that none can think of marrying whiles he remains amongst them; they have plenty of all things provided for them, brought out of all parts of the world by means of their traffick; they have excellent company among themselves, free from all troubles of the world. Some time they spend in their de∣votions morning and evening, they are constantly together at their Church-offering, their prayers to Almighty God for the Empe∣rours person, and the Empire. The rest of their time they spend in the improvement of their talents, and
<PB N="86" REF="47"/>
in their several affairs for the bene∣fit of their Covent; they do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> weary themselves late in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> works, but at a convenient ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> towards the evening they repair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their lodgings, and there take to∣gether such civil Recreations as an innocent and retired life will af∣ford. I look upon the condition of these men the most happy i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the world, they are neither bur∣thened with commands, nor vexed with taxes, nor disturbed with suits in Law, nor tormented with the cares of this world, nor consu∣med with the unlawful pleasure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it, nor disquieted with many miscarriages which do naturally attend men of business; but here they live neither idle nor useless, but having employed themselves moderately, they have time to re∣vive their spirits with some Re∣creation. If there be a Paradise on
<PB N="87" REF="47"/>
earth, I think it is in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> a∣mongst these Monks and Fryers; they are so far from begging, that at solemn times of the year, at the Nativity of our Saviour, at Easter, Pentecost, <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> and the birth-day of the Emperour, they send their liberalities to all the poor people round their Covents, especially to those that are burthe∣ned with numbers of Children, and have nothing to make them subsist but their daily labour. Were our Fryers, our Franciscans, Mendicants, and the other Orders of Religious men of this dispositi∣on in his Holiness dominions, the people would honour and respect them, and they would gain much credit to the Roman Church by such practises, and to themselves. These Fyers that are thus retired out of the great concourse of the towns and people, are of several
<PB N="88" REF="48" MS="y"/>
fraternities, some are called the Moncks of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> these are the most numerous. Their foun∣der was an <HI>Anachoret</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> that spent his latter days in the desart places in tilling and dressing the ground. He drew unto him such numbers of people that were wea∣ry with the toil and troubles of the great world, that he saw ma∣ny thousands imitate his example before he dyed. The other fra∣ternities are those of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> of St. <HI>Maconius,</HI> whose employment is the same with the Monks of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> they differ only in their names. In every Covent they e∣lect every year a Superintendant whom they call <HI>Loucana;</HI> he is to keep good orders, and to an∣swer all the miscarriages that are committed by the Society, if he allows of them.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="48"/>These blessed places are to pay no Revenue to the Emperour, but of their prayers. All other Lands are at his disposal by the Statutes of the Empire, he is the Lord of them, but these that belong to the Fryers are none of his, and free from all impositions. So are all the other Lands and places that belong to the Clergy; for we may take notice that the tythes of all things belonging to the Emperor, the Clergy and those that attend in the worship of God have a maintenance appointed unto them out of certain Lands and territo∣ries: which they must see manured as well as the rest of the people do theirs, for they receive little or no benevolence from the Country, they depend not upon them for their maintenance: so that by that means they are highly honoured of all men, and beloved because
<PB N="90" REF="49"/>
they rather give to them, than take from them; and although they are well rewarded for their pains from the Lands allotted to them, their good Offices look as favours and kindnesses done to the people, because nothing proceeds from their labours or Estates to reward the Priests instructions and Attendance.</P>
<P>The Churches are separated into three distinct places or rooms according to the manner of the <HI>Jews.</HI> At the entrance of the Temple, about six paces there is a Curtain drawn that makes the first separation, every body may go into the Church, but none but those that have been sanctified by the <HI>Abuna</HI> have liberty to go into that place, and pass the first Cur∣tain. This was wisely enacted to oblige all the Nobility and Per∣sons of Quality to receive that be∣nefit
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>
from the High-Priest, and by tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> means to endear him unto them. Next to this place before the Altar-table, is drawn another Curtain, beyond which none hath liberty to pass but the Priests themselves when the Communi∣on is administred. These curtains are drawn, but the people keep themselves in their several distinct places until the time of the Com∣munion.</P>
<P>The Churches are very neatly adorned with Pictures, which these people do not worship, but only as Ornaments to their Religious Houses, they place them there. The Churches are built of Lime and Stone, which they use not in their common buildings; for they think it decent that the places set apart for the Service of God should have no common materi∣als. None therefore but some se∣lect
<PB N="92" REF="50"/>
houses of the Emperour are built in this manner, and with the same substance.</P>
<P>When the Priest hath lost his Wife by death, he may not mar∣ry again unless he wil lose the power of executing his function, yet the Patriarch may give a Li∣cense to marry again, but without that License it is altogether un∣lawful.</P>
<P>They bury their dead with the greatest ceremony imaginable, they cloath them in all their most gaudy attire, and carry them in a Chair with their faces and hands uncovered, if the dead hath been a Souldier, he hath the honour to go armed into the grave; before, march the Priest and the Religi∣ous men, saying some good sen∣tences, advising the people to pre∣pare to depart; then comes the Corps seated in his Chair of State
<PB N="93" REF="50"/>
trimed with Garlands and Flow∣ers, and with some white Feathers, if he be young, with yellow if he be of a middle age, and with black if he be old. The sight is so plea∣sant, that it would almost give e∣very one a mind to be in the room of the dead; the Parents follow with a badge of mourning upon their heads, a handful of ashes, the next come their friends and ac∣quaintance; thus they proceed to the Grave in order, where the first ch. of the Gospel of S. <HI>John</HI> is read, &amp; the noble Actions &amp; vertues of the dead are rehearsed, all hearing with much devotion, then the Priest as they put the body in the Grave pronounceth these words, <HI>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return.</HI> The next day they give alms, and send gifts to their friends in the name of the deceased, and bring upon his Grave a banquet
<PB N="94" REF="51"/>
according to the Quality of the Persons. And every day for a moneth they continue to visit the Sepulchre of the dead, and to of∣fer up some prayers for him to Almighty God, for they imagine something of purgatory, and of the unsealed estate of the Soul im∣mediately after its departure out of this life, which obliges them to intreat for them, that they may enter into the joys of the bles∣sed.</P>

it; I did really hear strange voi∣ces and names in the air, but saw nothing, but I did attribute the cause to the wind, and the dispo∣sition of the mountains that are so placed, that when a strong gale blows upon the Rocks there are unusual names heard; the wind strikes also through several Caves, and at the entry many shreiks and crys are heard, so that the Coun∣try people dare not adventure in to know the cause of them. The vulgar opinion is, that this place leads into hell, and that the Souls of the damned tormented in these lower-parts of the earth, do send up here their complaints. I did visit these Caves, near them none would come with me for fear of mischief. I perceived the cause of the wonder, and did discover it to some of the Fryers, but their ig∣rance and superstition would never

believe me; from their infancy they had been bred up with an ap∣prehension of these dark Caves, which no reason could possibly remove from them: I went to see all the curiosities of this Country with my guard, being ac∣companyed by some Persons be∣longing to the Emperours Court, they led me into a deep valley, where we heard nine Eccho's or returns of our voices one after another. At the end of it near a large fountain, the ground being very stony, we found several slates very white that had Images of Beasts and men imprinted in them in a blew character, so perfectly, that no hand could ever paint them better.</P>

<P>In this Kingdom was a famous City called <HI>Caxumo,</HI> it was the Metropolis of all <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but it
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>
hath been mightily ruined by the Wars, so that at present it shews but a few houses that serve to receive Shepheards and Graziers, for here is abundance of Cattel of all sorts, round about stand many old Ruines over-grown with herbs, but yet they declare the im∣portance and greatness of the Ci∣ty that did give Laws to this part of the Country, although it is so near the line the air is very tem∣perate, not so much by reason of the continual brises that blow very fresh from three a clock till the afternoon, as because of the abun∣dance of fresh water Springs that are very cold in the hottest time of Summer. Near this City is a fountain that contains much wa∣ter, but never yields any until the Beasts do come to drink, and when they do approach it flows over, and gives a very plentiful stream

of clear water very grateful to the Palate. We had here a sight of a strange sort of a Cat, about the bigness of a Leopard, the In∣habitants do use the dung in many sort of medicines, and to dye their Cloath and Cottons in blew. It is not so fierce as other beasts of that bigness, but extream fearful, it keeps for the most part in inac∣cessible mountains and Rocks, and seldom adventures it self in the plain Country, although it runs as swift as any creature I have seen. Here are also great quantity of Rhinocerots, Tygers, Leopards, Wolfs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for here are many Woods that serve for a retreat to these furious kinds of creatures.</P>
<P>I must not omit a memorable story that is spread amongst the people of a certain hill that is sci∣tuate between <HI>Dongali</HI> and <HI>Tigre∣mahon,</HI> where a Saint, very much
<PB N="106" REF="57"/>
respected by the Country people, was shut up in prison and condem∣ned by the Pagans that possessed this place to die in the beginning of Christianity: He was to be fa∣mished to death in a high moun∣tain on the top of a rock unto which he was ty'd hand and foot: he continued there many days ex∣posed to the fury of the Eagles and Vultures, and other ravenous Birds without any harm. These cruel fowl instead of feeding upon his naked body unable to defend it self, did bring up to him of the choicest meat that they could steal in the lower Country, and on the top of that hard Rock there burst forth a large stream of living water so near his head, that he had the liberty to sup some up, and re∣fresh himself when he was dry.</P>
<P>The spring continues yet to run, it falls down above sixty fatham

high from a steep rock down a precipice. They say that their fore-fathers when they saw this miracle, and that at the end of two or three months he was in perfect health, as formerly, they embraced the Christian faith. They shew besides the Tomb of this Saint that dyed amongst them in a very old age. It is visited by several pilgrims that come from the other Kingdoms of the great <HI>Neguz.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants are excellent Marks-men, they have been try∣ed in the wars against the King of <HI>Adel,</HI> so that they have approved themselves the best Souldiers of the Emperours dominions. They use Bows and Arrows, a long lance much like to a <HI>Roman,</HI> of late they have fire Arms, and some few pieces of Artillery.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="58"/>The Emperour chuseth out of this Kingdom his common guards, because that they are not only good Souldiers, but have a meen more manly than the ordinary sort of people of these Regions.</P>
<P>In this Kingdom that is the lar∣gest, and the best belonging to the <HI>Neguz,</HI> great numbers of <HI>Jews</HI> are dispersed. The Christians treat them with much civility, they suf∣fer them to trade amongst them to reap the fruit of the earth to enjoy the liberty of their Religi∣on, by that means great numbers have embraced that profession that did teach love and kindness to strangers, hoping to meet with greater advantages when they should become brothers, for there is no invitation more powerful up∣on the spirits of a man to oblige him to initiate himself in Religion than a sincere affection expressed

by the professors of it. The ad∣vantages to be expected in Chri∣stianity are sufficient to perswade us, violence better becomes a <HI>Mahomet</HI> than Christ, he never made use of his whip, but to drive men out of his Church.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> have here their Sy∣nagogues, but they are at present so little frequented, that I think the name will be one day lost by reason of their great numbers that daily turn Christians.</P>
<P>It was in this Kingdom that I saw a Black-a-moor with two heads joyned one to another, and two faces, one behind and another before, the rest of his body was very well proportioned. It was a monster of about twenty years of age, he was way strong in his Limbs, he discoursed unto us with one Tongue, sometimes with the other, and sometimes both to∣gether;

he was obliged to feed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> behind and before, he eats as much as two men. The heads were di∣stinct and separated until they came to the neck bone there they joyned together.

the water would rise, swell, grum∣ble, and in an impatient manner run over the sides, although that which is cast in be never so incon∣siderable; but if the water be let alone, it remains without motion. About 15 leagues from that place towards <HI>Adel</HI> is a little Town call∣ed <HI>Bachlar,</HI> where in the Church at one end of it grows a Vine, the Inhabitants name it the <HI>Holy Vine,</HI> it grows within the walls of the Church in a room that is made a purpose for it; It is planted upon the Sepulchre of one St. <HI>Maximin</HI> that was buryed here. The peo∣ple told me it was above a thou∣sand years of age, and would sub∣sist until dooms-day, that the Saint at his death commanded it to be planted there, telling them, that as often as any twig should wither, they would receive a con∣siderable loss from the enemies,
<PB N="113" REF="60"/>
and that when it should dry up, Christ would come to judge the world, or the Infidels would over∣power the Christians; I was ad∣mitted to visit and pay my devo∣tions to it, the cluster of Grapes that it yields are very big, I could not see whether they grew natural∣ly upon the branches, that curiosi∣ty was unseasonable amongst a peo∣ple that would admit of no con∣tradiction, and that did find a great benefit from this belief, for both Heathens and Christians are pos∣sessed with this vulgar errour, that the story is true. I that was not so apt to receive such unusual tales upon trust, did desire to touch the Grapes and examine their reality, but the Priest forbad me, telling me, that it was an impurity that never any had been yet guilty of, and that he wondred how I that waited not upon the Altar did

dare to handle such holy things. I did not offer to examine further the business after this severe re∣prehension.

<P>ALthough this Kingdom is directly under the Line, there is not a more pleasant place to dwell in all over the world. It is full of Mountains and Valleys about twenty leagues in circumfe∣rence, adorned with high Woods and Forrests, the ground is ex∣tream fruitful, the people very civil, the Clergy devout, the No∣bles gallant and brave. In the mountains are many little Villages planted in the low ground, and in the midst of them is a strong Ca∣stle that looks like a Town, for the outmost wall contain about two miles in circumference. Here the Kings Children are kept with
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>
the Emperours as Hostages of their fidelity. They are all train∣ed up in several exercises, the only inconveniency is that they are here confined to live, which it may be to them is no inconveniency, for they never see any thing else but these mountains, and think the world hath no other place for a dwelling but here. The Bishop of <HI>Amara,</HI> a very grave man introdu∣ced us into the Castle where the Emperours Children were kept, they were then but young, the eldest was not above four years of age. His countenance was promi∣sing, we had a sight of the Gar∣dens and Walks full of pleasant Fountains and Rivulets, artificial∣ly brought into these high places. The Walks were covered with a Tree not usual in our Country, the branches were twisted one with another in such a manner that no

Sun could penetrate them, they were entertained always green, for at the root of the Trees on both sides of the Walk a little Cur∣rent of fresh water doth always run, that refresheth the roots, and preserveth them from the droughth of Summer. It is as de∣licious a place as any I have seen in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Children have the liberty to hunt and divert them∣selves out of the Walls of this Castle, but they are never to go out of the mountains while their Father lives; for that purpose a strict guard is kept at the passage where no man can go or come without leave. It is both narrow and steepy, made with the hand, a few persons are able to keep it from all the world; in the castle are places appointed for the exercise of the youth, and over them they have Masters learned and experi∣enced

in all those Sciences and Disciplines that they are to know. Here are excellent Astrologers▪ for that is a Science unto which this Country people is addicted. They have some here learned in the <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Tongues, others that give themselves over to the study of Philosophy and Nature, but very few do trouble their brains with Divinity; this makes them less notional, but more practical, for they know no niceties in Cases of Conscience to excuse their actions and inclinati∣ons</P>

<P>Since they have had knowledge of the <HI>Roman Catholick Religion,</HI> they have added something to their Creed by the consent of one of their general Assemblies, for they were careful to hinder their people from receiving any other Opinions than those that they had formerly embraced; for when they saw that our Priests and Je∣suits were busie in drawing them to the faith of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> they published a little ad∣dition to their Creed, to inform e∣very one of their judgments, &amp; hin∣der

<P>We believe that the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> is a pure Virgin, before and after the Birth of Christ; as she is the Mother of God, she ought to be loved and respected according∣ly, but we neither worship Her nor pray unto Her.

<P>We believe that S. <HI>Peter</HI> was the first of the Apostles, that the Stone that Christ mentions upon which his Church is built, is his Law and Faith; which Law is e∣stablished upon the Prophets and Apostles, unto them was granted the power of governing the Church, of binding and loosing, and to them was committed the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. But we do not acknowledge the Superiority that his Successors the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> do derive from S. <HI>Peter;</HI> nor do we believe that he ever had any priviledge which the others did not enjoy. We be∣lieve that the holy Apostles, Saints, and Martyrs that are in glory did follow the foot-steps of our Saviour Christ, and that they have received from him the par∣don

of their sins, as we do. We believe that we must honour them with the holy Angels, but we do not approve of prayers made unto them, nor of the sufficiency of their Merits to benefit us, or the Church of Christ. We believe that it is well done to confess our sins before the Ministers of the Church, for by their prayers we may be assisted and comforted▪ We receive all the books of the Old and New Testament, as they were delivered unto us by S. <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI> without any addition or inno∣vation.

<PB N="133" REF="70"/>
<HI>Abuna</HI> of our Church, with all the rest of our Ecclesiastical and Civil Magistrates and Superiours, but no other. We religiously be∣lieve that there is a place where the less Regenerate persons do go after this life, which is neither Hell, nor Heaven; what it is, and what the souls do suffer in it, we are not able to define. We be∣lieve that none can be saved with∣out the bloud of Jesus Christ, that it is sufficient to cleanse us from all our sins, without any other as∣sistance, and that we are not to trust upon the Merits of the Apo∣stles and Saints that were but sin∣ful men as we were. We believe that there shall be a day of Judge∣ment where Christ shall appear in glory to Judge all men; that we must all appear before him to give an account of our actions, and that after that we shall all either go to
<PB N="134" REF="71"/>
hell or heaven; the wicked to e∣verlasting burning, and the Righ∣teous to eternal bliss. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>This is the faith that the sub∣jects of <HI>Precious Giam,</HI> which we are to maintain until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. God grant us grace that we may never forsake it, notwithstanding all the persecutions and perswasions of the enemies of Christianity.</P>
<P>This addition was lately made, since the <HI>Portugueses</HI> and other <HI>Europeans</HI> have travelled into those parts; for when some Re∣ligious men did endeavour to per∣swade the Emperour to submit to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and joyn with the other Christian Princes in their obedience to the Popes power. He would never do it, not would never suffer the divulging the opinions which we do embrace in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="71"/>They do believe whatsoever is in their Books called <HI>Manda</HI> and <HI>Abetil,</HI> as the Gospel it self; they do fancy that the Apostles and Disciples being assembled toge∣ther at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> did cause them to be written for the benefit of Christianity. In them are con∣tained these precepts.</P>
<P>To fast every <HI>Wednesday</HI> in re∣membrance of the wicked resolu∣tion of the <HI>Jews</HI> made upon that day to crucifie Christ.</P>
<P>To fast every <HI>Fryday,</HI> because on that day Christ was crucified for our sins, on these days it is commanded to fast untill the even∣ing.</P>
<P>To observe forty dayes Lent, especially the Passion week, and then to feed upon nothing but bread and water.</P>
<P>To meet together on the Lords day, and then to hear the Reading
<PB N="136" REF="72"/>
of the holy Writings of the Apo∣stles and Prophets, which are to be expounded by some appoint∣ed for that purpose.</P>
<P>To meet also upon the Sab∣bath-day, and then to spend the time in prayer and holy duties, in which days it is not permitted to do any servile work. The <HI>Satur∣day</HI> they keep because God on that day had finished the great Work of the Creation of the world; The Lords-day is also set apart for Religious duties, because Christ on the first day of the week did rise from the dead.</P>
<P>Several other days of the year are kept holy, some are those that are observed in our Church, others are particular days appointed to continue the Memory of some great deliverances and particu∣lar favours which that Church and Empire have received.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="72"/>They do believe that in their Festival days; and in the Sabbath and Lords-day, the souls of the damned are released from their torments until the Evening, but that they can never come out of that place of darkness.</P>
<P>Some thoughts they have of Purgatory, but not as we in the Catholick Church; they do not think that Masses, Prayers, or any other pious actions can convey any benefit to the miserable souls that are there frying in the subterrane∣ous ovens; therefore they never bestow their Estates for the dead, but when they are departed, they leave them to their fortunes, as they do us to ours. One thing is very commendable amongst them; when any are dead that have left some visible estate, they send for the poorest persons of that place, &amp; offer unto them gifts in the name
<PB N="138" REF="73"/>
of the deceased; they make a Feast for others better qualified, and spend two or three days in Mirth and jollity at the expences of the dead; a custom derived from the <HI>Scythians,</HI> who did thus rejoyce when their friends depart∣ed out of the world, and did cele∣brate their entrance into it with the effusion of tears, or rather this practice is derived from the belief of a Resurrection, and the assu∣rance that the party that is dead is free from all the sense of mise∣ry and affliction, unto which the living are exposed daily.</P>
<P>They do not believe that Mas∣ses can redeem the souls of men from the punishments unto which they are liable by their miscarria∣ges, therefore they never see the Priest to huddle up before the Al∣tar any prayers for them, nor do the dying persons leave any an∣nual
<PB N="139" REF="73"/>
rents for Masses to be said in remembrance of him, or to fetch him out of the flames of Purgato∣ry.</P>
<P>The Sacrament of the Eucha∣rist they do administer, sometimes every Sunday or Sabbath-day, but as it was anciently practised by the the Christians of Primitive times in both kinds. They are not afraid of that inconvenience that the wise men of our latter days have thought upon, of profaning the bloud of Christ upon every unhal∣lowed lip, or by spilling it on the ground, therefore the people do receive with the Priest in a most humble manner, almost prostrate to the ground, before they take it into their hands, they make three bows to express the sacred Trinity of persons, and then with lifted up eyes and hands they eat the wa∣fer, or the bread, and drink of the
<PB N="140" REF="74"/>
cup, kissing it before they part with it out of their hands. They have as much reverence for that Sacrament, as we in <HI>Italy,</HI> but they do not think the bread to be Transubstantiated into flesh, nor the wine into bloud, nor do they pay any respect unto it, but only when they do receive it. I did en∣quire of some of them why they did eat it with that reverence, see∣ing they did not fancy it other than our ordinary bread; the answer was, that it was consecrated to a holy use, and that some respect was therefore due unto the Ele∣ments of Bread and Wine; but when that should not be, the most humble posture was most decent for those that received from Al∣mighty God, so great a favour as the signs of Christ Crucified. They do not preserve either the Bread or Wine upon their Altars (that
<PB N="141" REF="74"/>
are much like ours) to another day, nor do they send it to comfort the sick; that custom they do not approve of, because they may so frequently receive it every where, that they do not stand in need of it in so short a time as their sick persons do continue in their crazie estate.</P>
<P>This custom they have amongst them, that when any hath recei∣ved the Bread and Wine, he ne∣ver ventures to spit all that day, but retains all the humidity that flows into his mouth, and swallows it for fear of casting to the ground any part of that Cup that was in∣tended for to increase their faith. This custom is kept so Religiou∣sly, that there is a great penalty put upon every one that is seen to suffer any water to go out of his mouth that day, untill the eve∣ning; he is forced to pay to the
<PB N="142" REF="75"/>
poor, and towards the reparations of their Church a large summe of money, and to suffer an imprison∣ment six days, during which time he hath scarce enough of water allowed unto him to drink. Thus they punish excess or want of ab∣stinence by want of necessaries, a good way to make a man sober. They give the Sacrament not only to men grown up in years, but also to Babes and Children, for they do imagine, that seeing Christ and his Apostles do esteem them holy, of the body of the Church, and commands them to be admitted into the Communion of Chri∣stians, that therefore it is lawful to grant unto them the priviledges of Christian people, as if they had an actual faith as those that are more aged have. They are igno∣rant of those great disputes that have lately allarm'd <HI>Europe,</HI> and
<PB N="143" REF="75"/>
are not acquainted with theniceties that have put us together by the ears about the Eucharist. They know nothing of Transubstantia∣tion, the words of the Consecra∣tion they understand, without any interpretation, that they declare unto us the use and benefits that we are to receive by this Sacra∣ment in the Christian Church. They do not trouble their heads whether personally or virtually, whether corporally or spiritually Christ is present in his Ordinance. They hope for salvation without the knowledge of these curiosities, and I think they will attain unto it before us that are carryed by these disputes of the Schools to deadly animosities against our brethren; we had been in <HI>Europe</HI> very happy, if the liberty of be∣lieving in this particular had been left to every one of us, but the
<PB N="144" REF="76"/>
Devil cannot fish but in troubled waters, and turbulent men have raised these disputes for their own interest, but could never bring any benefit to the publick by them, but ruine and destructi∣on. If like the <HI>Abyssin</HI> Church, we had not troubled our selves a∣bout trifles, we had spared the bloud of many Christian Nations, and might be more ready to op∣pose the <HI>Turk,</HI> that daily incroaches upon us. In the celebration of the Sacrament, they use no cere∣monies, nor insignificant gestures at the Consecration, but as Chirst commanded, so they practice; the Bread is of the ordinary bread that they use in those Kingdoms, they take of the better sort for this use, and lay it in a large plate of Gold or Earth of a blew colour, and the Wine is of the juice of the Grape squeezed out of it on purpose.
<PB N="145" REF="76"/>
They place both very handsomely upon a Table or Altar at the end of the Church, and after the Con∣secration, the Priest followed by some Attendants, goes to the se∣veral Separations, where he deli∣vers both kinds to them, and they receive them with the greatest expressions of humility and thank∣fulness imaginable; after all is done, they sing a Hymn in the Church, and the Priest gives them leave to depart with a blessing.</P>
<P>They baptize both Male and Female, the Male on the tenth day, the Female on the eighth. This Sacrament they often do rei∣terate, but not out of necessity, but out of a custom that hath continued many hundred years derived as some do conceive from the practice of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that thought the bodily washing able to contribute to the salvation of
<PB N="146" REF="77"/>
the soul. These people therefore that were zealous Professors of that Religion, do yet retain many of their customs, although they do not believe those things that occasioned them at first for that reason they circumcise, they often wash, and to render their washing more beneficial, the Priest on the day of <HI>Epiphany</HI> repeats over to the persons sprinkled the words of Baptism, <HI>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</HI> All of them do declare that they retain this cu∣stom not out of the belief of its necessity, but only because it hath continued so long time amongst them for so many hundred years, they know not how to reform it. But I think that they have no mind to reform or leave it, be∣cause it flatters the interest of both Priest and people; for on that day the Princes officers do
<PB N="147" REF="77"/>
make a Feast, and give gifts in the name of their Emperour to seve∣ral persons, they rejoyce and suf∣fer none to do any servile work. This custom is strengthned by a Law very ancient, that whosoe∣ver is then baptized should be free from some small impositions that are laid upon them by the Prince. Their former Kings have thus in∣teressed the people in the obedi∣ence to their pious commands, so that although they see how the performance is insignificant and useless, nevertheless they do as Religiously observe this custom, as if upon it did depend their e∣ternal salvation; when the Chil∣dren are baptized, they give the Bread of the Sacrament softned in some Liquor to them.</P>
<P>Their Religion in general is a mixture of the Jewish and Chri∣stian, for they observe many of
<PB N="148" REF="78"/>
the Ordinances of the Law of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> that were meerly ceremonial, only because their fore-fathers did so. This people hath always had a great Veneration for that which is derived unto them by in∣heritance, and in which they were first educated, so that they dare not venture to alter what was re∣commended unto them by their Ancestors practice, they wisely fore-see the disorders that change would bring amongst them, e∣specially when the customs and ceremonies observed are in them∣selves indifferent.</P>
<P>If any be polluted according to the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> they forbid him to enter the Church until twenty four hours be past, and then he must cleanse himself with water.</P>
<P>For their Churches they have a great Veneration, insomuch, that
<PB N="149" REF="78"/>
in them they neither spit nor suf∣fer any unclean creature to enter, when they do go in, they take off their shooes, the reason that they do alledge is this, because <HI>Moses</HI> was commanded to appear before the bush with naked feet, their Temples being as holy as that place on which he did tread, they think themselves obliged to fol∣low the same Religious practice. They will not also suffer any to walk up and down in their Chur∣ches, nor to discourse of their pri∣vate business, nor to laugh, so highly do they reverence them; our people in <HI>Italy</HI> do profess as much outward respect, but they bear less to the Houses of prayer, for it is ordinary amongst us to make the great Churches a Ren∣dezvous of Lovers instead of praying to a Saint, many whisper their devotions to their Mistres∣ses
<PB N="150" REF="79"/>
that are at their sides; and they do return answers accordingly; thus they cheat the world that fancies them at their prayers, and they profane the holy places with unhallowed and lascivious actions. The <HI>Abyssins</HI> do shew unto such an excellent example of piety and and devotion. They are no l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss Religious in the other observances of Religion; the water in Baptism it is true they do not sanctifie by exorcisms, nor do they mingle any other ingredient, but as the Eu∣nuch of Queen <HI>Candaces</HI> was Bap∣tised by pure water, so do they dip or sprinkle with the same element free from mixture; all that are bap∣tised, they either dip or sprinkle them, that is left to the pleasure and choice of the Minister as he sees convenient, or as the con∣dition of the child requires he accordingly deals with it
<PB N="151" REF="79"/>
And when the child is but be∣sprinkled with water, he is lookt upon as well baptized as if he had been washed in the main Ocean over head and ears, for they think not that the quantity of water does bring any advantage to the soul, nor that an entire washing is essential to the Sacrament of bap∣tism, but rather so much only as may suffice to signifie the inward washing and clensing of the mind from all filthy inclination.</P>
<P>Their circumcision as we have said, they will not leave, but they do not esteem themselves for it, nor do they dis-esteem other Christians for wanting it, for they are sensible that the ceremony doth not render them more ac∣ceptable to Almighty God, nor doth it give them a pre-emi∣nence above others. It were to be wished that Christians over all the
<PB N="152" REF="80"/>
world were of their disposition, they would not then curse and damn their brethren for trifles, nor send them to hell because they do not jump with them into the same opinions, and follow the same frivolous customs invented by themselves. A Christian con∣descention becomes us, we should not rack and send to the flames, men of the same profession, be∣cause only they do not joyn with us in indifferent performances; but my design is not to shew the un∣justice of the Court of Inquisiti∣on, nor the cruelty of our Prelates against the dissenting persons that are scattered all over <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> but to declare the practice of the <HI>Aethioplan</HI> Church, and their moderation.</P>
<P>They have not that uncharita∣ble opinion of unbaptized Infants as we have, they do not judge
<PB N="153" REF="80"/>
them in hell or any other place out of Paradise, because they have not had the happiness to receive the Seal of the Covenant, but they name them half Christians here, and think that heaven is pre∣pared for them as well as for the rest of mankind hereafter, because that they are born of Christian Parents, sanctified from the womb and in the womb, by drawing some nourishment from the Sacrament of the Eucharist when their Mo∣thers do receive it, the least part of that being sufficient to sanctifie them.</P>
<P>They often make use of Con∣fession, not as we do, but in a man∣ner that commends their mode∣ration, their wisdom and modesty. The persons that are to confess do meet the Priest at certain days in the Church before prayers do begin, where they privately con∣fess
<PB N="154" REF="81"/>
unto him in general all those sins of which they are guilty; they name them not unless they be heavy upon their consciences, then they consult him about the reme∣dies proper to satisfie themselves, and about the means to avoid such miscarriages for the future. I could never learn that they were tyed to this by any other Law, but that which is derived from their own necessity and good; they are not tyed to particularize their crimes unless they see it conveni∣ent for their comfort and refor∣mation. The Priest assists them in this occasion, assures them of the mercy of God, of the pardon of their sins if they continue in that repentant, sorrow, and if it can produce the amendment of their lives. He prayes for them, and then sends them away with a bles∣sing. The woman that is near the
<PB N="155" REF="81"/>
time of her travel is wont to seek this comfort from her Ghostly Father. The man that is to under∣take some long or perillous jour∣ney unloads and discharges his conscience thus to render himself more ready to undergo the hazard. Those that march out with the armies, take with them some word of exhortation and comfort from their Priests, they esteem this cu∣stom necessary to them for the maintenance of Christian Religi∣on, and stir up from time to time mens drowsie and sottish spirits in the duties of Religion. By this means also the Priests do creep into the favour of every one, and become necessary in their Gene∣ration. We are naturally prone to contempt and sloathfulness in devotion, this practice is most proper to remove and rid us of those vices. Their confessions are more modest, more bene∣ficial
<PB N="156" REF="82"/>
and Christian-like than ours are. The Priest doth not by any power granted unto him pretend to absolve them, but he shews them the gracious promises of God in his word, and tells them how pleased he is at repentance, what hopes there are of his mer∣cy, he also warns them to forbear from ill company, and other temp∣tations that do endanger our e∣state; after confession they receive the Eucharist.</P>
<P>They acknowledge the Old and New Testament without any addition to them 46 of the old 35 of the new are the number of the books; unto these they think it not lawful to make any additi∣on, but they observe many other things that are not contained in these books. Their <HI>Menda</HI> and <HI>Abetil</HI> directs them in the manner of Discipline and Order that is to
<PB N="157" REF="82"/>
be observed in those Countryes; besides, they obey the constituti∣ons and degrees of their <HI>Abuna,</HI> and his Clergy, who commonly assemble once in two years at the Imperial Court to consult about the publick business, and give such orders as may prevent the mis∣chiefs that the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> do daily plot against them; for their Priests and Religi∣ous men do labour to incroach upon the simplicity of the <HI>Abys∣sins,</HI> and to abuse their good na∣ture, by making it a means to in∣crease the Professors of their Re∣ligion; they disguise themselves into Merchants and other necessa∣ry persons, that they might have the liberty to convey, with less difficultie, their venemous Doct∣rines to the sillypeople whom they Court with all manner of civility. To prevent therefore their de∣signs,
<PB N="158" REF="83"/>
and to give order to all the contingencies that do happen in a large Empire very often. This great assembly meets in the pre∣sence of their Emperour to con∣sult about the preservation of themselves and of Religion; the <HI>Abuna</HI> sits in the Chair, unless when the Emperour appears a∣mongst them himself, then the <HI>Abuna</HI> sits at his feet, and a Throne is erected a purpose for the <HI>Neguz,</HI> the Clergy, Bishops and other persons called from all the Kingdoms, are round about in a Ring in several ranks; when any is to speak, he riseth from his place and goes forth into the middle, and after an humble obeisance to the <HI>Abuna</HI> or Emperour, he declares his judgment, the plurality of voi∣ces determines the business in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="83"/>The affirmative part do lift up their fore-finger, and profess at the same time their consent, and if the plurality be on their side a∣bove two or three persons, their judgment is good and lawful, o∣therwise the business is debated untill that number be found in ei∣ther side. Their decrees are con∣firmed by the Emperour and his Privy Counsel, and nothing is lawful without his consent. He is the only Prince that governs in his dominions, none dares but by force of Arms pretend any jurisdiction over his subjects but himself, therefore he suffers nothing either in Church or State to be obeyed or imposed without his cogni∣zance. The Bishops and Clergy have a power to execute their of∣fice, teach the people their duty, and see to their several charges, but they dare not innovate or
<PB N="160" REF="84"/>
command the least new thing al∣though it be very necessary, with∣out the Emperors leave. He com∣monly declares his pleasure by granting a writing, unto which his Picture is annexed as a Seal, with a great Cross in his left hand, and a sword in his right. This Proclama∣tion is conveyed into those parts that it concerns, where the people do in a most humble manner re∣ceive it. When P. <HI>Clem.</HI> sollicited him to submit to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> he would never do it, but com∣manded the Embassadour that had made that proposition, to depart out of his dominions, where he had created a great disturbance, by divulging Doctrines that were not known in those parts before.</P>
<P>Thus the Emperour is sole Lord of both Spiritual and Tem∣poral, and will not give an account of his actions to any one upon
<PB N="161" REF="84"/>
earth. He is respected according to his Authority or Power, none dares oppose or contradict his commands, but they all yield a blind obedience unto them, pro∣fessing their willingness to submit by kissing on their knees the wri∣ting that is brought unto them.</P>
<P>They make little conscience in the choice of their meats, but because it hath been the custom of their fore-fathers to abstain from some sorts of flesh, they do ima∣gine that they had some reason to do it which they do not under∣stand, therefore they continue the same customs to this day, they will not eat of any Beast prohibi∣ted by <HI>Moses</HI> to the <HI>Jews,</HI> nor will they suffer any of them to be kill∣ed amongst them unless it be in hunting. If any such creature be dead, they bury him immediately; they will neither eat of flesh torn
<PB N="162" REF="85"/>
in pieces, nor that hath been hang∣ed, stifled, or of which some o∣ther beast hath been suffered to feed; they will not eat any bloud nor flesh where the bloud remains; in these particulars, they are Re∣ligious observers of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> not out of conscience, but they know not how to leave cu∣stoms unto which they were bred up from the beginning.</P>
<P>They have no corporal penal∣ties imposed upon them by their Confessors, unless it be in the Co∣vents and Religious Houses. In the Country those that commit any sin, do suffer for it the re∣proach of his Neighbour and sepa∣ration from the Eucharist, untill he professes his repentance, which commonly is done at the door of the Churches when the people and the Priest go out, the Peni∣tent presents himself with ashes
<PB N="163" REF="85"/>
upon his Head, and a sorrowful countenance confesseth his guilt, promiseth an amendment and re∣stitution of the damage if any be received by the Neighbour, then the Priest absolves him, by decla∣ring that for the time to come he shall have liberty to come to the Lords body. Those that are re∣fractory and obstinate they punish by forbidding their Neighbours to converse with them. Every one observes this so Religiously, that they flee from an excommu∣nicated person, as from a Pestilen∣cious body, so that he is forc'd un∣less he will become an <HI>Anachoret</HI> and run from the conversation of the world, to reconcile himself a∣gain to the Church by begging the pardon of his offence. The power of Excommunication is in the Bishop of every Diocese, who is informed by the Priests of eve∣ry
<PB N="164" REF="86"/>
Region or Precinct, of the misdemeanors of the people; when he is rightly informed, not only by the Priest, but also by the congregation, he dispatches an offi∣cer called a <HI>Shimcru,</HI> to give leave to Excommunicate the offending person. The Priest in a full assem∣bly informs the people of his com∣mission, declares unto them the ill behaviour of the person, his wicked life, and the scandal that he had given to his Neighbours, he makes a long discourse of the means employed to recal him of his obstinacy, in despising the Fa∣therly admonitions that had been made to him; and further shews the danger to let him continue in their Communion. He concludes with an Excommunication, and to render this action more dreadful, he gives leave to the infernal spi∣rits to seize upon such a person,
<PB N="165" REF="86"/>
casting into the Air a fire-brand▪ with some kind of execration.</P>
<P>☞ But this kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Translator.</NOTE> of severity is not often used, the offences must be very grievous to oblige the Church to cast upon them her thunder∣bolts, and when she doth it, is done with that precaution, and with that time, that the offender hath leisure to repent, and every one is fully satisfied that it neither proceeds from malice nor design. When men by their open profane∣ness and horrid crimes do disgrace the Christian profession, when they continue in this manner of life, and declare their contempt of God and his power; It is then only time to separate such from our Communion, who have alrea∣dy separated themselves from Christ, and declard their unwor∣thiness to participate with us in
<PB N="166" REF="87"/>
the privileges of Christian Religi∣on. This was the practice of the Apostles, and of the primitive Churches, they did shut them out of Heaven who declared they had no desire to come thither, and published to the rest the esteem that every one was to have of their persons. Amongst them the power of Excommunication was sacred and holy, it was only em∣ployed at the extremity when no other means, neither reprehension nor shame could recal men from their abominable vices; It was then esteemed accordingly, men were as fearful to fall under it, as to be cast into the flames of hell. And then it was followed by such effects as did declare the dreadful power of it; the evil spirits did take the excommunicated person into their possession, and did begin to torment him in the same man∣ner
<PB N="167" REF="87"/>
that he shall be in hell, so that many times people being sensible of their woful condition did fall upon their knees, and beg the par∣don of the Church. It was also the custom of old Christians never to come near an Excommunicated person, all his acquaintance and friends did shun his company; so that when he did see himself aban∣don'd by every one, shame &amp; grief did work upon him and obliged him to an amendment of life. In the time of the Christian Empe∣rours this power of Excommuni∣cation began to be horribly abu∣sed and profan'd in civil Matters, to satisfie hatred and vengeance, some Bishops did Excommunicate others; at the least displeasure, they would send their adversa∣ries to hell, and suffer no corre∣spondency to be further enter∣tained between them on earth;
<PB N="168" REF="88"/>
by this means they did proclaim a publick war one against another, and made use of the sacred wea∣pons of Excommunication to make good their quarrel, as if God were bound to espouse their par∣ticular interests and sins with them against those for whom they had conceived a displeasure. <HI>Victor</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> with one thunder∣bolt of the Vatican was resolved to cast all the Eastern Churches from the hopes of arriving to Heaven. The Bishops of <HI>Constan∣tinople</HI> Excommunicated those of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and they excommu∣nicated them of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and in the same City these thun∣der-bolts of Excommunication were heard against several facti∣ons, meer scar-crows when ill ap∣plyed; when Excommunication is abused to promote our secular in∣terests, it is like the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, of
<PB N="169" REF="88"/>
the Heathens, or the Canonisa∣tion of the Papists, a <HI>Chimera,</HI> a vain and frivolous action, if that may be so named, that profanes or disgraces one of the most sa∣cred parts of Religion, and mis∣apply that divine power with which Christ hath intrusted the Rulers of his Church. Let them take heed how and upon whom for the future they employ this holy weapon, for they may by the abuse of it bring a contempt up∣on themselves and Religion, that all their policy and severity will never be able to remove; I pray God to grant unto those amongst us such Christian wisdom and mo∣deration, that piety may be cherish∣ed, and the profaneness discoura∣ged; that peace and unity may Reign amongst us, and that they may advance the interest of Chri∣stianity as well as of this or of that faction.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="89"/>The <HI>Abyssins</HI> never burn an ex∣communicated person, nor do they use any violence against his Person or Goods, unless he offers to break the publick peace, or to pronounce something to the pre∣judice of the Government, then they lay hold of him and secure him in a convenient Prison. They never make use of excommunica∣tion, but in cases that concern the customs and manners of a man, and never then, unless he continues in his evil practises after admoniti∣on; when they restore a man to his former privileges, at his repen∣tance, they do not impose any pecuniary or corporal penalty, as we do in <HI>Rome,</HI> but he is admitted after the Bishop hath been ac∣quainted with it, only by declaring it unto the Congregation with the signs of his repentance; for as much as I could learn they do not
<PB N="171" REF="89"/>
think that our purses or our bodi∣ly punishments can further our Reception into Gods favour, un∣less the soul be really humbled and contrite. The flagellations and macerations of the body usual in many of our Cities of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> were never seen amongst them unless it be upon the borders of their Kingdoms amongst the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> whose Religions do recommend unto the Professors of them voluntary pe∣nances as high expressions of de∣votion; but this kind of devotion is not in practice amongst these Christians of <HI>Abassia,</HI> therefore they know nothing of indulgen∣cies and pardons granted by the Rulers of the Church. This trade was never introduced amongst them.</P>

<HEAD>Zagazabo the Emperour of Abassias Ambassadour in Portugal.</HEAD>
<P>AFter that I was come into <HI>Portugal,</HI> I had often many disputes with certain Doctors, e∣specially <HI>Didacus Ortifius</HI> Bishop of the Isle of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and Dean, of the Kings Chappel, and with <HI>Peter Margalho</HI> about the choice of Meats. It will not therefore be amiss to speak now something a∣bout it. First you must know that according to the Old Testament were observed the Rules for to
<PB N="177" REF="92"/>
chuse our Meats, which was com∣manded by Gods Word, that did afterwards take flesh of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> he did walk and converse amongst his Apostles. This word of God is alwayes the fame and ever living, never subject to change, therefore what he com∣manded should not be eaten be∣cause of its uncleanness, he never gave leave afterwards in his Go∣spel to eat it. It is true, he tells us that what enters in by the mouth; doth not defile the man, but that which proceeds from the mouth, but he doth not say it, that he might contradict what he had be∣fore established, but only that he might refute the superstition of the <HI>Jews</HI> that did reprove the A∣postles for eating with unwasht hands. And the Apostles them∣selves whiles they lived with our Saviour Christ Jesus, never made
<PB N="178" REF="93"/>
use of unclean beasts, nor did ever taste of those things that we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> prohibited in the Law, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of them did offer to transgress i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this particular. After our Saviou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Passion when the Apostles beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to preach the Gospel, none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ever prove by the Sacred Record<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they did ever eat or kill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> unclean beast. It is true, St. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> saith, whatsoever comes in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shambles eat, inquire not of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> conscience sake; after that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> saith, if any unbeliever doth inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you to a Feast and you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mind to go, of whatsoever is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before you eat, inquiring after no¦thing because of conscience. A¦gain, if any shall say this was sacri¦ficed to an Idol, do not eat of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> because of him that told thee, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> because of conscience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith to please the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that were not sufficiently confirm∣ed
<PB N="179" REF="93"/>
in the faith, because between them and the <HI>Jews</HI> there were many disputes and contentions; to the end that he might appease them, he sided with, and labour∣ed to please the Christians that were not confirmed in the faith. This he did not to break the Law, but only by granting some∣thing of the ceremonies, he might win them to the faith. The same Apostle saith, Let him that eat∣eth not despise him that eateth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or him that eateth not judge him that eateth; for he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, and he that eateth not, eateth not to the Lord.</P>
<P>Therefore it is an unworthy act to reprove forrein Christians so fiercely and in a hostile manner, as I have been for this and other matters that concern not true faith. It were more wisely done
<PB N="180" REF="94"/>
to bear with such Christian men as the <HI>Greeks, Armenians,</HI> and <HI>E∣thiopians</HI> are, to treat them with kindness and charity, and to suffer them to live and converse with o∣ther Christians, for we are all baptized in the same baptisme, and subscribe unanimously to the same belief. There is no cause where∣fore any shold so furiously dispute about ceremonies, let every one observe his own without hatred and railing one against another, for that the correspondency between Churches should not be interrup∣ted, if afar off they use customs in those Provinces proper to the place and genius of the people. Besides, we have in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> how <HI>Peter</HI> saw the Heavens opened, and a certain vessel come down like a great sheet bending on the four corners to the earth, in the which were all
<PB N="181" REF="94"/>
sorts of four-footed Beasts and Serpents of the earth, with the Fowls of the Air, unto him the voice did say, <HI>Rise</HI> Peter <HI>and eat,</HI> unto whom <HI>Peter</HI> answered, <HI>Far be it from me Lord, for I never did eat any common or unclean thing.</HI> The voice answered him, <HI>What God hath purified do not thou call it unclean;</HI> which being often repea∣ted, the vessel was taken up into Heaven.</P>
<P>These things being done, the spirit sent him to <HI>Caesarea</HI> to <HI>Cor∣nelius</HI> a pious man, and one that did fear God, unto whom as <HI>Peter</HI> did preach: <HI>The Holy Ghost fell upon all that heard the word of God, and</HI> Peter <HI>did baptize,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Vision is thus interpreted by us in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the clean Beasts are the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> the un∣clean the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who are thus called, because they are worship∣pers
<PB N="182" REF="95"/>
of Idols, and act the unclean works of the Devil. And whereas the voice said unto <HI>Peter, Peter rise and kill,</HI> we thus understand it, <HI>Pe∣ter, Baptize, Eat;</HI> that is, preach and publish the faith and the Law of our Lord Jesus Christ to the peo∣ple of <HI>Israel,</HI> and to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> It is certain that it can never be found, that <HI>Peter,</HI> or any other of the Apostles did either kill or eat unclean Beasts after this Vision. Now when the Scripture menti∣ons food, in several places it in∣tends to signifie unto us Christ and his Doctrine; we must not therefore understand it of any cor∣poral or nourishing food. All the learned do agree that this sheet that was shewn unto <HI>Peter,</HI> did teach him high and sublime mat∣ters, and not the inferiour things of the world that relate not to our salvation, neither are we to ga∣ther
<PB N="183" REF="95"/>
from thence that we have liberty to eat of unclean things, seeing that can never be gathered out of Scripture; wherefore do the Apostles amongst the Decrees of their Council command us not to eat of creatures hang'd, stran∣gled, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn in pieces, or half eaten by other beasts, or of bloud; for God loves cleanness and sobriety, and hates glutton∣ness, and uncleanness. God loves them also that abstain from flesh, and much more them that feed upon bread and herbs, and are content with water, as St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> that lived a Hermite be∣yond <HI>Jordan,</HI> he always fed up∣on herbs, St. <HI>Paul</HI> the Hermite led a sparing life in the desart 80 years, St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and St. <HI>Maca∣rius,</HI> and many of their followers never tasted any flesh. Therefore my brethren you must not con∣temn, nor revile us, for St. <HI>James</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="96"/>
saith, he that speaks evil of his bro∣ther, or Judges his bother, speaks evil of the Law, and Judges of the Law; and S. <HI>Paul</HI> advises to be con∣tent with our own traditions, and not to dis-pute about the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> with Christians, wherefore it is not handsome to quarrel with our brethren about the Law, or the choice of Meats, for meats do not render us more or less acceptable to God; therefore let us seek af∣ter the heavenly food, and set aside these frivolous disputations about meats.</P>
<P>These things that I have here written about traditions, proceed not out of an itch of disputation, nor out of contention, but only that I might justifie my own peo∣ple from the cruel accusations of many who having no respect for my Master the most Potent Em∣perour <HI>Precious Giam,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or for us
<PB N="185" REF="96"/>
his subjects, do revile us and call us <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> because we observe the <HI>Saturday</HI> as the <HI>Jews,</HI> and fast till Evening as the <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> they say these things should not be done by Christians, they do also complain against us for the Marriage of our Clergy, who have the same liber∣ty as the other people: and be∣cause we are re-baptized every year, as if we did distrust the effi∣cacy of the first baptism, because we circumcise men and women, which custom the <HI>Jews</HI> do not ob∣serve so punctually; because we keep the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> in the choice of meats; and because we judge more charitably of Christi∣an children before baptism than they do, and esteem them not as Pagans, but as half Christians. I have been forced to publish this that I might justifie my own peo∣ple
<PB N="186" REF="97"/>
from their slanders that accuse us, and that I might oblige the Doctors of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to be the more kind to us. I know not by what Religious instinct they have been moved to forbid me to participate with them in the Body and Bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, since I am come into <HI>Portugal,</HI> neither do I know where∣fore I am esteemed amongst my Christian brethren as a Heathen and an excommunicated person which hath caused me much grief, but to him that sees and Judges all things I remit my cause.</P>
<P>I am not sent by my most migh∣ty Lord the Emperour of <HI>Ethio∣pia,</HI> to the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the most Serene Prince <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> only to entertain them with disputations; but to con∣clude a firm league, and open a correspondency between them,
<PB N="187" REF="97"/>
not to discourse about humane traditions, but to inquire about the errours of <HI>Arrius</HI> the Prince of Hereticks, and know whether the Christians of <HI>Europe</HI> do joyn with us in opposing his opinions; and further, that I might know whe∣ther it be the custom of the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Christians to assemble in Counsel twice every year about Matters of faith, as the Apostles have commanded in their Synodi∣al book, the first assembly they order to be met on the day of Pentecosts, the second on the tenth of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, I am come to know how we agree about the errours of <HI>Macedonius</HI> of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> and of <HI>Eutiches;</HI> about the last the Coun∣cil of <HI>Calcedone</HI> assembled, but the Bishops broke up the assembly before any Conclusion, retaining their own opinions; My Lord, the
<PB N="188" REF="98"/>
most Mighty Emperour hath-all the books of the General Coun∣cel's, and is much grieved, so are all his subjects; for the discords and errours, these Tares that the Devil hath sown in the Lords field; the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> we have always <HI>est comedus,</HI> the first and most powerful Bishop of the world, and were it not for the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> whose Country be∣ing between us, do hinder our passage, &amp; for the great distance of places, we should send to his Court very often. King <HI>Ema∣nuel</HI> of blessed Memory did first open a way to us from the Red sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Having spoken of these things, I will say something of our Empe∣rour, &amp; of our Patriarch. You must know first, that our Patriarch is thus solemnly elected by and out of our Monks of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that
<PB N="189" REF="98"/>
there do dwell at the Sepulchre of our Lord. When the old Pa∣triarch is dead, the Emperour di∣spatches away with all speed an express to the Monks that live at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as soon as they have received the news of the death of the <HI>Abuna</HI> with the Presents that the Emperour sends to our Savi∣ours Sepulchre, they proceed to the election of another <HI>Abuna,</HI> whom they chuse by the plurality of voices. It is not lawful to pitch upon another for that office, but only upon an Inhabitant of <HI>Alex∣andria,</HI> and upon one whose life is irreproachable. When they have chosen him, they give unto him his dispatches with the messenger that came to give them notice of the former <HI>Abuna</HI>'s death. They go together to Grand <HI>Cairo,</HI> to meet the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Patriarch that hath there his ordinary residence,
<PB N="190" REF="99"/>
to the end that he may be ac∣quainted with the election. The Patriarch when he approves of the sufficiency of the person for so e∣minent an office; he sends him in∣to <HI>Ethiopia</HI> with the messenger, who must always be according to the ancient custom, a Monk of the Order of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> the Hermite, with him this messenger hasten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> towards <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> wherewith all ex∣pressions of joy and honour they are received of all men. Some∣times a year or two passes before this business can be dispatched. In the mean while the <HI>Neguz</HI> disposes of the great Revenue of the <HI>Abu∣na</HI> according to his pleasure. Now the chief office of an <HI>Abuna,</HI> is to confer Holy Orders, none but he can give them, or ought to take them away, or degrade the Priests. He never affects to meddle with the giving of Bishopricks, or of
<PB N="191" REF="99"/>
Benefices that do belong to the <HI>Precious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam,</HI> who may do with them according to his pleasure. And when the Patriarch or <HI>Abuna</HI> is dead the Emperour is the Heir of his Estate, which is very great. It belongs also to the Patriarch to excommunicate contumacious of∣fenders. He never grants any In∣dulgencies of those penalties that are imposed for grievous faults. The Sacraments of the Church are never prohibited to any unless it be for the crime of Murder. Our Patriarch is called in our lan∣guage <HI>Abuna,</HI> he that is at present in this place is called at his baptism <HI>Mark;</HI> a man aged of about 100 years. Moreover it is to be noted that we begin the year the first of <HI>September,</HI> which is with us the Eve of St. <HI>John Baptists</HI> day, the rest of the Feast days we keep at the same time that they are kept
<PB N="200" REF="100"/>
by the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> We must not omit that St. <HI>Philip</HI> the Apo∣stle came into our Country, and did there preach the Gospel of our Saviour Christ.</P>
<P>You must further know the name of our Emperour, that it is <HI>Precious John</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam,</HI> and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Priest John,</HI> as here it is falsly re∣ported; for it is written in our language <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam Belul,</HI> that is, <HI>Pre∣cius</HI> or high <HI>John</HI> in the Chaldai∣que Language, it is written <HI>John E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>coe,</HI> which hath the same inter∣pretation <HI>Precious</HI> or excellent <HI>John.</HI> He is not to be named Em∣perour of the <HI>Abyssins,</HI> as <HI>Matth.</HI> hath written, but of the <HI>Ethiopi∣ans.</HI> He being an <HI>Armenian,</HI> could not know our affairs perfect∣ly, especially those that concern our Religion; for that reason he declared many things to King <HI>E∣manuel</HI> of happy Memory, which
<PB N="201" REF="100"/>
are not so amongst us, not out of any design of deceiving him, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was a good man, but because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was well acquainted with our Religion.</P>
<P>The Empire many times doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot fall to the share of the Eldest Son of the Emperour, but to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto whom the Father will give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. He that now governs is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hird Son of the last Emperour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hath deserved that honour by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is piety and respect which he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his Father; for when he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon his death-bed, he command∣ed all his Sons one after another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sit upon the Imperial Throne, which they did, he only excepted; Far be it from me, said he, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould ascend to the Seat of my Lord and Father, which pious mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty procured him the Empire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om his Father; his name is <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> his Empire is very large, and

contains both Christians and Hea¦thens. In it are many Kings and Princes, Earls, Barons, Grandees and much Nobility, that is mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> obedient to him. Gold and Sil∣ver are given and exchanged by weight. Amongst us are many Towns and Cities, but not such as I have seen in <HI>Portugal,</HI> because <HI>Precious Giam</HI> doth always live i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a flying Camp, and in Tents▪ This Custom is observed, that the Nobility might exercise them∣selves continually in Military A∣ctions, for we are surrounded on all with sides the enemies of our faith with whom we have often many Conflicts, always, or for the most part with success, through the goodness of God.</P>
<P>This is the account <HI>Zaga Za<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i</HI> gives of his own Country, his Re∣lation may be consulted by those that desire more satisfaction; for

<P>We have not been the first that have heard of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Chri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>ans, for they have Churches, not only in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but also at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> where for a while they have had liberty to perform their devotions. From the Voyages of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> and the Journal of <HI>Francis Alvarez,</HI> who passed into the heart of <HI>E∣thiopia,</HI> many things may be known of them, and of their cu∣stoms; until this time we have heard only of the name of <HI>Ethio∣pia,</HI> but it is strange that in the time of our fore-fathers, we first heard that there were <HI>Ethiopians</HI> from those of <HI>Asia;</HI> for about 300 years ago they did command in <HI>Asia,</HI> especially <HI>Drangiana</HI> upon

which in the <HI>Persian</HI> language (that is in <HI>Asia</HI> as universal as the Latin is in <HI>Europe</HI>) signifies Apo∣stolick. <HI>Padescha Prestegiani,</HI> the Apostolick King, that is, the Christian King.

<P>They have no Oil nor Olive Trees, but an Herb that serve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them instead of Olives, it is call∣ed <HI>Henar,</HI> they steep it and draw out the juice that looks like Gold, very beautiful to the eye, and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="209" REF="104"/>
less pleasant to the taste, for the Oil or Liquor extracted from it hath neither smell nor taste, and is very fat as Oil uses to be; so that the Inhabitants are by that means supplyed with that which serves them as well as the best Oil of <HI>I∣taly.</HI></P>
<P>The Woods and Rocks are full of Bees, so that they have much Honey and Wax, with which they make Candles, for they have no Tallow, because they do not kill many tame Beasts. Here is a great Trade of Raw Silks and Stuffs which the Blacks fetch from hence to carry into their Country, where no Trees are to be found to harbour the Silk∣worm. Upon the confines of the <HI>Neguz</HI> dominions near the King∣dom of <HI>Damut</HI> are Mines of Gold about the lake, out of which the River <HI>Niger</HI> proceeds, so that this
<PB N="210" REF="105"/>
river carrys away some of the sandy part, and rowls it with the stream that is extream fierce, (for it falls from high Mountains) and runs with a great impetuosity to the main Ocean; upon the sand the <HI>Negers</HI> do pick up much Gold which crumbles from the Rocks, and proceeds out of the Mines that are dispersed all over the Country.</P>
<P>The N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hath people daily at work in them, they are com∣monly men taken Captives from their Enemies. When the <HI>E∣thiopians</HI> go out to War, they save the lives of all those that submit themselves to their mercy, and send them to these places to pre∣pare the Gold, and fit it for the use of the people.</P>
<P>Some Silver Mines are also here, but not so many as of Gold, for the hot country is not so proper
<PB N="211" REF="105"/>
for that kind of Oar. The parch∣ing Sun is more powerful in this Climate in the bosom of the earth, so that all the ground that is proper for the substance of Gold, it turns it into this Metal. The Mines are not so deep as in other Kingdoms, they are much like unto our Quarries of Stone in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Stone or Rock with which the Gold is mingled is very sandy, so that it will crumble with∣out any difficulty. The mine doth usually run in a vain, it is easie to distinguish it by the colour, which is distinct from the other part of the Rock. The Inhabitants say that all along the River that bursts forth of the Lake <HI>Laira,</HI> many such Golden Quarries are to be found, so that the violence of the stream doth sometimes un∣loose the more precious part from the rest, and carry it away to the
<PB N="112" REF="106"/>
great benefit of the Inhabitants, who gather it up along the shoar after great Rains; and afterwards they carry it to <HI>Gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> or to <HI>Mo∣zambique,</HI> and other places of note where Merchants resort. In the Land towards the Country of the Blacks, lives a people very de∣formed and mishapen, different from the rest of men, not in the main composition of the body, but in the disproportion of the parts. They do not love to appear amongst persons that have the true form of men; necessity con∣strains them to entertain a Trade, which they do in such a strange manner, that they are not like to the rest of Nations. They inha∣bit the Country called <HI>Guangara</HI> and <HI>Media,</HI> it is mountainous and inconvenient for passengers, whom they never suffer to go through their dominions. The River <HI>Niger,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="106"/>
so full of Gold passeth along their Territories, and furnishes them with that Commodity, to ex∣change for those other Commodi∣ties that nature requires, and that they have not in such plenty as their Neighbours. It is a business of difficulty to speak with some of them they are so savage. Those that Trade upon the River, may Land their Goods and see them afar off, but they seldom do shew themselves. They are very just in their dealings, and will not wrong strangers of a farthing, which if they did, it might put a stop to their Trade, without which they cannot probably live▪ They seem to have some Govern∣ment amongst them, for upon the mountains, places are fortified, and the passages blockt up, and they have been seen to observe a De∣corum in their manner of Life and behaviour.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="107"/>From this place many Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> have their Golden dust, for the ships go up the River ma∣ny hundred leagues to Trade with this obscure sort of people, who shew themselves afar off, leaving with their Merchandise such to∣kens and signs, that may express their demands, but they alwayes retreat at the same time into the Woods, and will not suffer any to come near. This hath been re∣lated to me for certain by many eye-witnesses, and by persons of Credit and Worth; this is a strange sort of people, which none of their Neighbours can certainly know.</P>
<P><HI>Ethiopia</HI> yields many other Commodities, Hides are very plentiful, especially of the wilde Beasts and Buff-skins, which in this Country are bigger and thicker than in any other. Here are stuffs
<PB N="215" REF="107"/>
made of the Bark of the <HI>Indian</HI>-tree that grows also here in every place; the common people are employed to fit it for sale and work. Some Spices, Drugs, and Roots do naturally come forth in this Climate called by the anci∣ents the <HI>Torrid Zone.</HI> The Mer∣chants of <HI>Adel,</HI> and <HI>Mozambique,</HI> and of other places adjoyning to the Sea do enter into the Land in times of Peace to Trade with the Inhabitants and fetch from them their Commodities, to convey them afterwards to the Sea-side, where the <HI>Moors,</HI> the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and <HI>Banyans</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> do meet them, with the Factors of other Nations, to take from them their Goods. Now this is the policy of all the Princes that keep the Sea shoar, not to suffer an <HI>Abyssin</HI> unless he be an Apostate to have liberty to Trade out of the Coun∣try
<PB N="216" REF="108"/>
of the <HI>Neguz,</HI> of whose power they are very jealous, least he should recover again the Domini∣on of the Sea, which he hath lost, with all his Ships and Sea-port Towns, some few years since. When he offers to stir, all his Neighbours do joyn together to force him into his bounds, for he is lookt upon as their common enemy. Some nevertheless of the <HI>Abyssin</HI> Monks have correspon∣dency with the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Chine∣ses,</HI> but it is only for those Mer∣chandises that are for the supply of their own territories.</P>

<HEAD>A short Relation of some of their Emperours found in an ancient <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Record▪ that the Author hath brought with him into <HI>Ita∣ty.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Empire is very ancient, and was as large in its first beginning, the people were war∣like, incroaching daily upon their Neighbours, especially upon those that live in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and about the River <HI>Nilus.</HI> The <HI>Egyptians</HI> have had continual wars with them. In the time of the <HI>Pharoes</HI> our Emperours were famous; <HI>Moses</HI> the Lawgiver of the chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> was the General of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> or of King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> he was ordered to march with a party of <HI>Israelites</HI> against <HI>Mouchadir</HI> Emperour of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he readily obeyed, and with a
<PB N="218" REF="109"/>
small party he routed the great Army of our Emperour, not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much by valour as by the assistance of a divine power; the King of <HI>Egypt</HI> was grown jealous of him and of his people, and therefore he sent them to this war, hoping to free himself from his fears by the swords of the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> who were become terrible to all their Neighbours, but God caused that which was intended for the mis∣chief of the <HI>Israelites</HI> to turn to their advantage, for by the Vi∣ctory, they purchased unto them∣selves the esteem and admiration of all their enemies. It is true, that the King did then begin to vex the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> with hard bur∣thens and grievous taxes, thinking by that means to weaken their spirits, and disable them from in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring either himself or any other, but this also turned to their bene∣fit,
<PB N="219" REF="109"/>
for it procured their freedom, and the ensuing miracles that for∣ced it from those that kept them in bondage. When the <HI>Egyptians</HI> were overthrown, the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> had wonderful success against them, they subdued all the Country as far as <HI>Thebis</HI> border∣ing upon the Red Sea, but about thirty years afterwards there rose a King of <HI>Egypt</HI> that was valiant in war that recovered with his small numbers of men, all the domini∣ons belonging to his Predecessors, as far as the Mountains where the River <HI>Nilus</HI> hath a terrible down∣fall. In his race it continued until the time of <HI>Cambyses</HI> who enter∣ed <HI>Egypt,</HI> and conquered it, but could never subdue <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> for when he sent his Embassadours to our Emperor, they were sent back with a defiance of his Power, as he was passing over some of the
<PB N="220" REF="110"/>
sandy hills between <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> with some of his Troops, they lost a great number of men in a storm of wind, for they were there buryed alive; some of them saved themselves with their King out of the violent storm, but this overthrow prevented his coming into our Country, where our Em∣perour expected him with all his people. The wind did fight for us against our enemies, it saved us the trouble and hazard of venturing against them with our swords.</P>
<P>In the time of King <HI>Solomon,</HI> our Empire was governed by Queen <HI>Maqueda,</HI> she sent Embas∣sadors to him, and afterwards went to visit him her self, she was kind∣ly entertained at her return, she was brought to bed of a Son which she had by <HI>Solomon,</HI> called <HI>Melich,</HI> she brought Circumcision into the Land, and laid the foundations of
<PB N="221" REF="110"/>
the Jewish Religion, which her Son afterwards when he was come from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> did establish, commanding all people under his command to receive it. After him many Kings did Reign in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the most famous was <HI>Ubsharem, Habraini, David</HI> the 1 <HI>Solomon,</HI> the 1 and many others. The Scepter hath always continued in the same race since that time until now. <HI>Ubsharem</HI> was a warlike Prince, he conquered all the Provinces as far as the Sea-coast South-wards, and made all the Kings his Neigh∣bours to send Presents to him, but when he was forty years old he grew amorous and wanton, so that his new conquered subjects took advantage of him in a Battel, where he lost all that he had con∣quered with his life, his successour laboured to revenge this affront, but in vain, until the days of <HI>Da∣vid</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="111"/>
the first, none ever did recover the vast dominions that did for∣merly own the <HI>Ethiop.</HI> Scepter. This Prince was wise and very politick, sufficiently qualified to fit at the Helm of State, but he was no Warrior for want of Courage; to manage the affairs in desperate occasions, he appointed a General, <HI>Zecharia,</HI> a stout man that did per∣form the Office of his Prince in this particular. He was very suc∣cessful against all our Neighbours, especially against the Blacks that inhabit beyond the sands, their Princes came to do homage unto our mighty Emperour, and to pay their yearly tribute; they conti∣nued in their obedience many years, until the Reign of <HI>Joseph</HI> the third, a Prince that was given to all manner of debauchery, he Reigned ten years, and was after∣wards killed by his chief Officers▪
<PB N="223" REF="111"/>
who were willing to preserve the State from total ruine; which would have happened had he con∣tinued longer upon the Throne, for he did not only permit, but also invite the enemies of the Em∣pire to enter into his dominions, that they might revenge him of those Princes that he did not love, and that he did not dare to pu∣nish himself, therefore he made use of the strangers weapons to vex them that he could not other∣wise overcome. From that time we have nothing remarkable, until Christs death at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> for all the Princes that did rule until that time were neither good nor bad, they contented themselves with their own limits, and if they did lose any part of their possessions, they never made any great noise by raising their Armies to retake them. Queen <HI>Candace</HI> was a most
<PB N="224" REF="112"/>
pious and Religious Woman, her Eunuch of the Race of Black a-Moors did follow her steps, he made his Pilgrimage to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> every five years from that place, he brought the Christian faith that did daily increase, insomuch that not one was found opposing it within two hundred years after. The eldest Son of <HI>Candace,</HI> for whom she did govern was <HI>Shedi∣ahr,</HI> a mostvertuous man, he encou∣raged Christian Religion in his do∣minions, but would never suffer the old ceremonies to be abolish∣ed, so that since, the Jewish and Christian are mingled together; he pull'd down many Idol Tem∣ples upon the borders, which cau∣sed the revolt of some of his most superstitious subjects, but one bat∣tel brought them under his com∣mand again. His Son was <HI>Adres∣chek,</HI> he succeeded his father
<PB N="225" REF="112"/>
when he was but sixteen years of Age. A certain Heathen Priest had crept into his favour so much, that for his sake he did labour to oppose the success of the Christi∣an and the continuance of the Jewish Religion in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> His Princes could not suffer him long, they conspired against him, and placed his young brother in his place, but him they sent into the Kingdom of <HI>Damut,</HI> into a close Prison that hath always been in those parts; he did afterwards e∣scape out of it and fled to the Blacks, who did come against <HI>E∣thiopia</HI> with a strong Army, but they were vanquished and forced to suffer their Fugitive Prince to become a Prisoner again. The el∣dest Son of this King was an ac∣complished Prince, so that his Uncle had some jealousie of him, &amp; therfore clapt him in a close pri∣son
<PB N="226" REF="113"/>
with his Father, but when he was dead, the Grandees fetcht him out of his confinement, and raised him to the Throne during the life of his Father, who consent∣ed to the promotion of his Son. After him <HI>Absalom</HI> was a famous Prince, renowned for his careful provision against the enemies in∣cursions, for he caused certain Forts to be built in convenient places to bridle them in. They were afterwards neglected and ruinated by the Wars. He first began to encourage Shipping, by offering great advantages to the Mariners and men that did study the Art of Navigation. This good policy caused all the idle persons to render themselves ex∣cellent in the Sea affairs, and laid the Foundation to that greatness, unto which the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Empire did afterwards rise.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="113"/><HI>Benjamin</HI> Reigned forty years, about the year 600 after Christ, from his time we have a good ac∣count of all our Kings, but before none are named but those that have been excellent for some ver∣tue, or infamous by their notable vices. This Prince was full of piety, he reformed the disorders of the Clergy, and put them in that form of Government in which they are at present; before, the persons that did wait upon the Worship of God, had no set∣led allowance; the people gave them what they pleased, so that unless they did work as other peo∣ple for their livings, they were reduced to great necessities, which nevertheless did happen in many places, for he that depends upon his peoples kindness, shall be en∣entertain'd with course Diet; unto this great evil that entroduces
<PB N="228" REF="114"/>
many others in a Nation; this Religious Prince did bring a Re∣medy. As he was the sole Lord of all the Lands of his Empire, and that none enjoyed them but from him, he caused such a quan∣tity of ground to be set apart for the maintenance of the Priests and Bishops, as might entertain them with the yearly Revenue, and caused this Land to be sepa∣rated from the rest, by granting unto it the priviledge of immu∣nity from all saxes and Imposts, so that they depend no longer up∣on the Crown. This liberality redeemed the Clergy from con∣tempt, and raised them in the e∣steem of the people, that usually treats them, not according to their desert, but according to that State that they maintain.</P>
<P>After the good Prince, his se∣cond Son <HI>Hechakiah</HI> did Reign,
<PB N="229" REF="114"/>
he followed his Fathers footsteps, therefore he was blessed with a prosperous Reign, his greatest e∣nemies did respect him, he conti∣nued in the Throne about thirty five years, and a few moneths.</P>
<P>His Brother <HI>Abraham</HI> the first, succeeded, he held the Scepter ten years, and then left it to his Son, with all the Wealth his Brother had gotten.</P>
<P>His Sons name was <HI>Haroahki,</HI> a Warlike Prince, he began to leave the Cities, and to pass his time in Tents, for in the begin∣ning of his Reign all the Nations subject to the <HI>Neguz,</HI> began to re∣volt from him, he could not ap∣pease the tumult so soon; he was therefore forced to live in the Camp, and to be in continual action all the time of his Reign. He caused it to be enacted for the security of the State, that the
<PB N="230" REF="115"/>
<HI>Ethiopian</HI> Emperour should never spend above six days in a Walled Town at a time, but should live in the open Field. All the Nobili∣ty that doth follow the Princes custom, imitates him in this parti∣cular. They look upon it as a great expression of weakness and fear to run into a fortified place. This hath caused them to neglect such places, and suffer them to be dis∣mantled by time, so that at pre∣sent in all the Empire there are but few Walled Towns, and they are so pitiful that the weakest e∣nemy might storm them. In the time of this Prince, Trade and Shipping did mightily increase, so that he was dreadful to his Neighbours, when he had gover∣ned the Empire twenty six years, he dyed.</P>
<P><HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li</HI> his Son succeeded him, he was the youngest, his Father had
<PB N="231" REF="115"/>
for him a great kindness which was increased by his address and handsome behaviour. His elder brethren were set aside, and he was raised upon the Throne, he was very happy all his time, and enjoyed a firm peace with most of his Neighbours, he continued Emperour forty seven years and three moneths. After him <HI>Hell</HI> the second <HI>Melach, Charvah, Bou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, Grimshach, Habraim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. &amp;c.</HI> with about thirty Kings are to be rec∣koned from that time to the year, 936. In which year the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Emperours that were grown so potent by Land, adventured to en∣large their dominions by Sea in <HI>Asia;</HI> for that intent <HI>David</HI> Em∣perour of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> prepared a Fleet of above 500 Sail of ships small and great to transport his Army, composed of 60000 Men, both Horse and Foot; with this
<PB N="232" REF="116"/>
numerous Army he Landed in <HI>A∣rabia,</HI> and conquered all that part of the Country that lies upon the Sea-shoar. The <HI>Abyssins</HI> found their abode in <HI>Asia</HI> far more plea∣sant than in <HI>Africa,</HI> therefore great numbers of men went over and passed the Seas into the new conquests. The <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Ara∣bians</HI> did oppose their designs, but our Emperour being there in per∣son, did so order his business that all the Forces that were sent a∣gainst us were routed, many bat∣tels were fought between us with various success.</P>
<P>The last was near the place where the River <HI>Euphrates</HI> dischar∣ges it self into the Sea, seven Kings were met upon the place with all the men that they could conveni∣ently bring to withstand our Em∣perour. The enemies reckoned about two hundred thousand men
<PB N="233" REF="116"/>
in their Army; we had then about forty thousand, this unequal num∣ber did encounter them, and by the wonderful goodness of God they did overcome them. This Victory opened a way to our suc∣cess in <HI>Asia,</HI> for it rendred the name of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> most terrible, so that none did dare to meet us with equal numbers of men, every year our people sent great numbers of men with their Families, to inhabit in <HI>Asia,</HI> and by that means to secure their interest from the ancient Inhabitants by force of Arms. The next that succeeded in the Empire was <HI>Un∣can</HI> I. A man no less Valarous than his Father, a great lover of Learning and of the Learned men, he enlarged his dominions beyond the River <HI>Indus,</HI> and conquered all that part of the Country that is so fruitful, that the <HI>Asiatiques</HI> esteem it the best and most fruitful
<PB N="234" REF="117"/>
Province of that part of the world. This Prince had several encounters with his Neighbours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Asia,</HI> where he made for the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> part his residence. In one the King of <HI>Malabar</HI> came against him with 40000 Foot and Horse▪ The <HI>Ethiopians</HI> were full of valoue and courage, but the numbers of their enemies put them to great straits, so that they offered to ren∣der themselves into their hands in case they would suffer them qui∣etly to depart with their lives sa∣ved. The enemy would not ac∣cept of that offer, to his own de∣triment, for ours being refused the condition proposed, and seeing no∣thing but death, or at least but bondage and misery prepared for them and their Prince, they tool courage, encounter'd the enemy with a great resolution broke the first ranks of them, and then pur∣sued them with that fury, that
<PB N="235" REF="117"/>
they left not killing until the whole multitude with their King at their head fled away, leaving all their own spoils, and the Goods that they had taken in the former advantages they had had against our Emperour. Several Empe∣rours did succeed him, but not to his Fortune and Success unless it be <HI>Joseph, 3. Judahr, Macarius,</HI> and <HI>Paulus.</HI> They carryed the terrour of our Arms into <HI>China,</HI> and there possessed themselves of many large Provinces which we enjoyed until the year 1436. The Tartars about that time made some In-roads into <HI>China,</HI> and finding the Climate good, and the Country fruitful, they invited their Countrymen into those Re∣gions. Some few years after they had gathered a numerous Army to enter <HI>China,</HI> they conquer'd the Emperour of that Country,
<PB N="236" REF="118"/>
who had desired our assistance a∣gainst them, we complyed with their desires, our Emperour sent 30000 men to their assistance, but by the stratagems and valour of the Tartars, our men were almost all slain. The <HI>Chinenses</HI> being de∣stitute of that succour, yielded themselves to the mercy of the Conquerours, who thought upon nothing but how to revenge themselves upon us; they came therefore with their own forces, &amp; with those that they had gathered in the Country, and drive out our people out of <HI>China,</HI> giving no quarter to those that submitted to them. There arose some dispute between some of our Generals at that time, that assisted the Tartars against us, so that when <HI>Uncan</HI> was kill'd in a battel by <HI>Cingi</HI> the Tartar Prince, all our Countrymen left <HI>Asia,</HI> with all
<PB N="237" REF="118"/>
hopes of returning thither again. Since, we have had many grievous encounters with our enemies the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have sometimes persecuted us in∣to the heart of the Country when they took us at an advantage. A∣bout the year 1434 the King of <HI>Adel</HI> with many of our Neigh∣bours stormed our Sea-port Towns when our Emperour was but young, and so shut us in, that we have no place to entertain Commerce with any Nation without their leave.</P>
<P>In the year of our Lord seve∣ral <HI>Portugueses</HI> came from <HI>Goa</HI> in∣to our Country, our Emperour dispatcht away some Embassa∣dours with them to <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> 1486 came into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> from <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal, Pedro de C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilham ec a lenzo de Pavia</HI> to <HI>Alexander</HI> our <HI>Neguz,</HI> that treated them well.</P>
