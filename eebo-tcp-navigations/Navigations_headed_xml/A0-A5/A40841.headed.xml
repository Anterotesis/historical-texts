Now they resolved to go to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which was again besieg'd by the Sarazens: the Lady <HI>Bellisant</HI> requiring the Duke of <HI>Aquitan</HI> to bear them company, so being ship'd, the wind serving, they soon landed near <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but could not come to the City; but <HI>Pacolet</HI> gave notice to the Emperour and King <HI>Pepin,</HI> that there was an Army arrived from the Duke of <HI>Aquitan,</HI> which would assail the Sarazens Camp in the night on one side, whilst they issued out of the City on the other, which was to the total con∣fussion of the Sarazens, who were all slain by break of day: And as soon as the Battle was finished, the Emperour and King <HI>Pepin, Valentine</HI> and the Green Knight, took their way to the Sea-side to meet <HI>Bellisant;</HI> as soon as the Emperour saw her, he leapt off his horse, and fell on his knees and imbraced her, intreating he a par∣don for her heard usage, whilst she for joy sounded in his arms; but recovering her self, they went to the Palace where no∣thing but salutations pass'd that day; and the Emperour did great honour to the Duke of <HI>Aquitan,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Fezon.</HI> But all this while <HI>Valentine</HI> did not see his of Sun Beauty, at which he much woundred; when all the Train were entred, and the salutations o∣ver, <HI>Valentine</HI> calls <HI>Polet</HI> aside, and enquires where he left the La∣dy <HI>Clerimond;</HI> now began <HI>Pacolet</HI> for to fear to tell him of her loss but <HI>Valentine</HI> being earnest with him, he declared that she was stoln
<PB REF="11"/> away by <HI>Adrimain,</HI> and carried away by King <HI>Trompart,</HI> upon his horse; <HI>Valentine</HI> hearing this, could not chuse but shed many tears in remembrance of his Lady, and resolv'd to search the whole World for her. But to leave him amidst his sorrows, let us return to King <HI>Pepin,</HI> who seeing all things in peace, took his leave of the Emperour and Empress, and <HI>Valentine;</HI> but <HI>Orson</HI> he desir'd to bear him company into <HI>France,</HI> which he did, where they were re∣ceived with great joy, and they highly esteemed and honoured <HI>Orson,</HI> which much grieved <HI>Haufry</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> insomuch that they plotted how to take away his life, and the execution of their design they committed to one of their Nephews, who was Vsher unto the King's privy chamber, his name was <HI>Granier,</HI> their design was to hire their Nephew to enter into the King's chamber in the night and murder him, and then to lay it on <HI>Orson,</HI> who alone had charge of the King: The night was come wherein they design'd to finish their purposed treason, and <HI>Granier</HI> being hid in the Chamber, ri∣ses, and assays to cut the King's throat, but being afraid, he laid the knife down in the bed, and went his way and told <HI>Haufry</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> what he had done, and said he would accuse <HI>Orson</HI> with the laying it there, which would be enough to condemn him. The next day <HI>Granier</HI> said unto the King, <Q REND="inline">May it please your Majesty: I will betray unto you, the Practiser of your overthrow; <HI>Orson</HI> in∣tended to have murthered you in bed, and to that intent hath laid a knife therein: now if it please you to send and see, you'll find my words true. The King at this, enrag'd, said, False Tray∣tor, can such a thought enter into thy breast, who shall I trust! seeing thou, whom I account as my Child, does prove a Tray∣tor to me?</Q> <HI>Orson</HI> being innocent, would have spoken, but the King would not suffer him, but called his Lords to be Eye-witnes∣ses of this tragedy intended; coming to the King's bed-chamber, they uncover'd the bed, and found the knife, which drew great a∣stonishment in them: The King presently condemned <HI>Orson</HI> to death; but by intreaty of the Lords, he was allowed the combat against <HI>Granier</HI> and his Brother, which combat was perform'd with much valour on both sides, till <HI>Orson</HI> had slain one of them, then the other being very weak, cry'd for quarter, and confess'd 'twas he that should have kill'd the King; but before he could utter any more, <HI>Haufrey</HI> drew his sword and cut off his head, for fear he should betray them. The King was joyful for <HI>Orson</HI>'s victory, and went to meet him before he came to the Palace, and did him great honour, and bid him have a care of <HI>Haufry</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> who

Valentine</HI> hearing this, and ready to burst with grief, the Castle being invincible, he departed and went to <HI>Angory,</HI> a City that had been taken from <HI>Brandiffer; Valentine</HI>'s arrival much re∣joyced the wearied Citizens, who were quite tir'd with the daily a∣larms of the Pagans: here <HI>Valentine</HI> fought many battels, and won much honour; and in one battle he took King <HI>Luca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Priso∣ner, by the policy of <HI>Pacolet,</HI> but this was the last piece of service that he did <HI>Valentine,</HI> for King <HI>Lucar</HI> espying him in the hall where he was kept, stept to him and stabbed him, before <HI>Valentine</HI> could come to his succour; <HI>Valentine</HI> enraged at this dismal hap, began
<PB REF="12"/> thus, <Q REND="inline">False Traytor, thou hast slain him who was all my hope, but thy life shall surely pay for it.</Q> Then <HI>Valentine</HI> fell on the dead body, and lamented over it grievously. But <HI>Brandiffer</HI> hearing of King <HI>Lucar</HI>'s state, seat a Messenger into the City to <HI>Valentine,</HI> to tell him that he should have the King of <HI>France</HI> for his ransom; which greatly contented <HI>Valentine:</HI> King <HI>Pepin</HI> be∣ing safely arrived in <HI>Angory, Valentine</HI> did him great honour; and King <HI>Pepin</HI> declar'd to him how he was taken Prisoner at <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> and had remained ever since Prisoner in the King of <HI>In∣dia</HI>'s Court; and told him that the fair Lady <HI>Clerimond</HI> was Pri∣soner there, who counterfited madness to avoid the Kings love. Now began <HI>Valentine</HI> to take courage again, after all these storms fair weather begins to appear; now he's in hopes to bring his wishes to a good end, and close up all his travels with a quiet life; he is resolved to leave <HI>Angory,</HI> and in habit of a Pilgrim travel to the King of <HI>India</HI>'s Court, and there make known that he can cure mad and lunatick People, and all other diseases.

<P><HI>VAlentine</HI> being arrived at the City where the King of <HI>Indian</HI> kept his Court, like a Physician takes up his lodging at an Inn in the Town: His Host began to enquire of him what he was: <HI>Valentine</HI> told him he was a Physician that could cure all manner of diseases, and therefore desir'd him to set his Man go into the City and post up some Bills, that he might make known his are, whereby to get somewhat to defray his charges; which his Host consented to: The Man having done as he was appointed some of the Courtiers chanced to espy the Bills, and reading in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the Man could cure Madness, declares it to the King; presently <HI>Va∣lentine</HI> was sent for, and the King call'd him aside and declar'd to him, that he had in his Court a Lady that was lunatick whom if he would cure, he should have a bountiful reward: <HI>Valentine</HI> at∣tending on the King's tale, told him he would endeavour the re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oring the Lady to her senses, <Q REND="inline">Therefore, great Soveraign, cause a Fire to be made in her Chamber, and I'll be with her to

And now, my dear Love, behold the extremity I have cast my self into, into what baseness I have cast my self for thee; but Love dearly bought, they say, is the sweetest.</Q> After their kind salutations were past, she shewed him <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI>'s horse which rejoy∣ced his heart: <HI>Valentine</HI> then set <HI>Clerimond</HI> thereon, and turn∣ing the Pin, they suddenly arrived in the City of <HI>Angory,</HI> to the unspeakable joy of the Inhabitance. The next day they were married in as great solemnity as so short a warning could afford; after dinner were exercised many pastimes which lastedt ill n ght, which caused these two incom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>able Lovers to prepare for bed, where we'll leave them unto those sweet embraces enjoyed by Lu∣vers: <HI>Valentine</HI> remained a month in <HI>Angory</HI> with his beloved Lady, and then thinking of his Father's Imprisonment, he resol∣ved to endeavour his release by a cunning Plot, he will, like a Marchant, put forth ships well mann'd, and richly laden, and go to this Castle and proffer to sell 'em to the Lady <HI>Galazy;</HI> with this resolution he put to Sea, and in a short time arrives at the Castle where he armed his Men privately, putting their Cloaths over their armour: So <HI>Valentine</HI> went out of his ship Marchant like, and coming to the gate the Porter ask'd him what he brought he cold him he had store of Iewels aboard, and he desir'd to know whe∣ther the Lady of the Castle would make choice of any of them, the Porter went and inform'd his Lady, who sent the Governour, with some Souldiers, to view them; being come into the sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps, the Christians, as <HI>Valentine</HI> had before commanded, slew them: then <HI>Valentine</HI> caused them to put on the Turks apparel, and to set forward to the Castle, carrying with them many Iewels; the Porter thinking them to be the Men of the Castle, let them pass
<PB REF="13"/> in, where they slew all the Infidels, and broke open the doors till they came to the Lady <HI>Galazy</HI>'s chamber, and demanding the keys of the prison; she delivered them, wherewith they opened the Pri∣son, released the Emperour, the Green Knight, and the Peers of <HI>France.</HI> As soon as this enterprize was finish'd, <HI>Valentine</HI> sail∣ed to <HI>Angory,</HI> and left his Father, the Emperour, and the others, to take their rest: The Emperour soon after hearing the City of <HI>Angor,</HI> was begut with <HI>brand-ster</HI>'s Hoast, resolved to leave the Castle, and to ship himself and ten thousand Men, and being at Sea they engaged with a Fleet that was going to aid <HI>Brandiffer,</HI> and soon overcome them: The Emperour commanded his Men to put on the Pagans armour, that they might safely land; which stratagem prov'd fatal, as you shall hear; and just as they arrived, <HI>Orson,</HI> attended with one hundred valiant Knights, came into the Port also, to the great joy of the Emperour: Now the Christi∣ans in <HI>Angory,</HI> for want of provisions, resolved to give the Pa∣gans battle: and so were devided into ten Bands, led by ten vali∣ant Captains, whose courage and conduct added valour to all the o∣thers. The Pagans knowing their design, put themselves into fifteen bands, standing in battle-array; the Christians issuing sud∣denly out of the City, presently put all in confusion, resolving to die or conquer; great courage was shewed on both sides. <HI>Valen∣tine</HI> slew a Pagan Commander at the first onset; and meeting the <HI>Indian</HI> King unhorsed him, and had he not been rescued by his Followers, he had lost his life by <HI>Valentine</HI>'s keen sword: and if fresh Succours had not come, the Pagans had been put to flight, which renew'd the fight, so that the air was darkned with the smoke, and nothing was heard but cries and confusion of voices; but on a sudden news came that a great Fleet of Sarazens were ar∣rived at the Port, and just landing. <HI>Valentine</HI> hearing this made great hast to the Port with a select Party to strengthen the Guard there, (but little need was there of it, for these were Christians commanded by the Emperour, his Father, joyned by his Son <HI>Orson</HI> and his Knights;) <HI>Valentine</HI> being ignorant who they were, charged them furiously, and the first that he engaged he run quite thro' the body, which unfortunately was the Emperour. <HI>Orson</HI> seeing his Father slain, began to weep, and knowing <HI>Valentine</HI> by his armour, said to him, <Q REND="inline">Alas, Brother <HI>Valentine,</HI> here's small conquest in this, for you have slain your Father.</Q> <HI>Valentine</HI> hear∣ing this, broke out in such a grievous lamentation, that it grieved all his Followers to hear him, <Q REND="inline">Alas, quoth he, what an infamous
<PB REF="13"/> deed have I done? What a wicked act have I committed? I have spent my life in trouble and now have added murther to my other sins.</Q> <HI>Orson</HI> seeing him thus lament, comforted him, and desired him to go with his Army to the battle, for the Pagans in his absence had prevailed. At last <HI>Valentine</HI> being set on his horse flew like a lion into the midst of the battle, and meeting a Pagan Prince, run his sword thro' his body, and being careless of his life, proceeded on till he came where <HI>Brandisser</HI> was making havock of the Christians, he rushed so fiercely on him, that he struck him to the ground, and with his sword clove his head: The Pagans seeing their Generals slain, and some began to flie, founded a re∣treat; the Christians greedy of their blood, pursuing, slew many thousands, others leap'd into the Sea and were drowned, leaving the Christians a compleat victory, who immediately returned into the City, where was great lamentation made for the unfortunate death of the Emperour of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where he was nobly bu∣ried But <HI>Valentine</HI> refused all comfort, and who was as a Man out of his wits. As soon as they had setled the affairs in <HI>Angory,</HI> they crowned the Green Knight King thereof, who had in the battle valiantly slain several Pagan Commanders, and then departed to∣wards the City of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> In the mean time great troubles arose in <HI>France;</HI> King <HI>Pepin</HI> being arrived there, and the twelve Peers of <HI>France,</HI> from the strong Castle where they had been Pri∣soners, <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fry</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> begin to plot the death of the King and Queen, and their young Son <HI>Charl main,</HI> whom the King had made Heir of the Crown and Kingdom: to bring this th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r devil∣ish design to pass, they invite the King and Queen, and their Son to a rich banquet, but <HI>Charlemain,</HI> came not; in the midst of the banquet they fill'd a cup of deadly poyson and gave it to thy King, and the King dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk to the Queen, but the poyson wrought so in their bodies, that they fell down dead of the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter that they seized on all the strong Cast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttes, but could not find the young Prince <HI>Charlemain,</HI> who was under his Sister's protection; whereupon having aid from the King of <HI>England,</HI> she fought ma¦ny battles successfully against <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fry</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> till they were both slain and <HI>Charlemain</HI> was crowned King, to the great joy of the whole Kingdom, for he eminently shewed forth his Father's vertues. In the mean time our Royal Train arrive at <HI>Constantinople</HI> to the ex∣ceeding joy of the Empress <HI>Bellisant,</HI> and the whole City, but when she heard that her Husband the Emperour was slaine <HI>Valen∣tine</HI> and <HI>Orson,</HI> byh e consent of her and the whole Nation, we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e

And after that great preparation was made for the funeral, and his body was enterred with all honour due to so noble a Warriour. <HI>Orson</HI> lives long after with his Wife the fair Lady <HI>Galazy,</HI> (whom he married after the death of the Lady <HI>Fezon,</HI>) administring Iustice to all; and was greatly beloved of all his Subjects.</P>
