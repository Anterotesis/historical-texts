And forasmuch as many of you do Treat to bring into the Ports of <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> the City of <HI>Sivil,</HI> and other Places, great quantity of <HI>New-found-land</HI> Fish, and other sorts of dry and salted Fish, because they are Victuals which are very necessary; and that you have been and are put to great Charges, and are much trou∣bled, I do Will and Command to be kept the Ordi∣nance of the City of <HI>Sivil,</HI> whereby it is Ordained, That those which come in with dry or salted Fish, there shall not be any Price or Rate set upon them, but they shall be permitted to sell at such a Price as they shall think good; and it shall not be necessary to manifest them any more then unto my Officers which receive my Royal Rents: and if the Ships wherein the said Fish is brought be great Ships, that they cannot go up the River, and that the same be put into Barques or Lighters, the Judge of the Admiralty, nor any other person, may not put any Waiters or Keepers into the Barques or Lighters at the Charge of the Owners of them.</P>
<P>And I do also Command, That if the said Fish shall appear to be rotten, and that it cannot be spent, that it be burnt, or thrown into the Sea; and that for this cause there shall not be any Cause or Action commenced against the Owners thereof, or persons which shall sell it, nor they shall not be Imprisoned, nor Informed against: And foras∣much as the Administers of the Customs, and o∣thers of divers Duties which are received for the Fruits and Merchandises, do use when any body doth Inform, to have the person Imprisoned which sheweth himself to be party, whereby happeneth
<PB N="31" REF="18"/>to Men of Trade great Discredit, Charges, and Vexations; My Will is, and I do Command, That in the said Information there shall be onely pro∣ceeded against the Merchandises, and not against the Persons; but they shall be permitted (as I do permit them) to make, and they shall make their Defences in the said Vexation. And forasmuch also, as according to an Article of the said Peace, which maketh mention of Matters in Religion, notwithstanding that in some Suits they should declare whether they be <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> or not, excusing themselves to give Faith to others which they take as Parties or as Witnesses;</P>
<P>I do also Command, That concerning this Mat∣ter there be not done, nor there shall not be done, any thing with those which are born in the said Realm, but onely that the said Condition be kept and accomplished, and that no such Questions be put unto them, giving unto the Oaths which they shall take in Judgment Court, and without, the same Faith and Credit which should be given in case they were <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and herein you shall not receive any trouble or molestation, nor there shall not be any grievance done unto you: And where∣as for the justification of some Causes, the Judges and Justices do pretend that the Merchants of the said Nation should exhibit Books of their Contra∣ctions or Dealings; I do Will and Command, That the Books of the Merchants of the said Nation shall not be taken out of their hands for any cause whatsoever, but they shall keep and shew them in their Houses, to take out the Parcel which shall be appointed, and others shall not be demanded of them, nor there shall not be any other Papers ta∣ken from them, upon Penalty that he which shall

<P>And forasmuch as the Merchants do dispatch the Merchandise from the Custom-house of the said City of <HI>Sivil</HI> of all Duties, and because there are many which do make up a Sheet, which is Sub∣scribed and Signed by all the Officers, and remain∣eth in the hand of the <HI>Alcayde</HI> of the Custom-house; for that by virtue thereof the Merchandises are per∣mitted to go forth, which are in Fardels, Packs, Trunks and Cases; and afterwards when they have taken them forth, and put them into their Houses and Warehouses, the chief Keeper of the Custom-house, and the Officers of the half <HI>per Cent.</HI> do visit the House and Goods, troubling and molest∣ing them, demanding of them the Dispatches, it seeming unto them that they may detain them, because they left the Dispatch in the hands of the said <HI>Alcayde</HI> of the Custom-house; I do Prohibit and Command, That the Houses of the said Merchants shall not be visited, nor the Dispatches shall not, nor may not be demanded of them, in regard they have them not in their hands; and this is to be un∣derstood, and is understood of Houses which are within the Walls of the said City; And to the end it may be known to you which are of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, there is to be delivered unto you Copies of the said Priviledges and Exemptions which do con∣cern you, and which were Granted unto you, as well by the Articles of Peace, as by any other man∣ner.

When this Delegate is Elected, the Nation shall Present him to his Royal Highness, with a Petition, that by his Authority he may be appointed to Exercise this Charge; By which Authority being Constituted,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Decide all Controversies.</NOTE> he shall with brevity and expedition Decide and De∣termine all the aforesaid Controversies, without the Formality of Legal Processes, according to the vali∣dity

From the Sentence given by this Delegate there shall no Appeal be made or allowed, except to the Tribunal of the Con∣suls of the Sea residing at <HI>Nizza,</HI> where the Dele∣gate himself is to be one, and sits as one of the Judges, from which Tribunal no Appeal is to be admitted.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Controversies amongst the <HI>English</HI> to be Decided by Arbitration.</NOTE> which for Life and Manners are esteemed Men of the greatest Integrity amongst them; these Three they shall humbly Present to his Royal Highness, that he may benignly please to appoint One of them, who under the Title of Delegate of his Royal Highness, is to Exercise the Office which shall immediately be declared: By whose Authority when he shall be Constituted, and to that purpose has obtained Letters from his Royal Highness, he shall notwith∣standing be incapable of Exercising his Charge, till he hath first taken Oath before the already men∣tioned
<PB N="117" REF="61"/>National Delegate; or, in his absence, be∣fore some other of the Consuls of the Sea residing at <HI>Nizza</HI> for his Royal Highness. These things premised, when a Controversie or Difference shall arise or happen, the I laintiff and the Defendant shalt each of them choose two Arbitrators, whom they shall declare and constitute to be such before the Delegate of his Royal Highness, to every one of which the Delegate shall administer an Oath up∣on the holy Evangelists, to this purpose; <HI>That they will according to the utmost of their power, laying aside all nespect of Persons, and according to good Conscience and best Rule of Justice, give their Sentence of Arbitration Righteously and Faithfully.</HI> After which Oath they may convene, as occasion offers, but always in the presence of the said Delegate; which Delegate shall have no Voice in case that the major part of the four Arbitrators agree in their Arbitration; which if they do, the Decision so made shall be valid and firm: But if the Arbitrators by reason of their equality of Votes agree not; then the Delegate of his Royal Highness, having first taken the same Oath the Arbitrators did, before one of the Consuls of the Sea at <HI>Nizza,</HI> shall have a Vote amongst the other four Arbitrators, and the Decision shall be on that side which has the majority of Votes, to all purposes valid and firm. In both Cases the Deci∣sion thus Amicably made, shall be transmitted to his Royal Highness within the space of One month, that by his Authority it may have its full force, and be put in Execution. This Delegate shall be further obliged to make Writings or Records, as Delegate of his Royal Highness, and it shall be his Charge carefully to keep and preserve the same. He shall be continued three years in his Office, and be obli∣ged

<P>There having been in Times past a Difference be∣tween the Ambassador of the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, both Resident in our Port, about the Merchants of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation; both which Ambassadors sent their Petitions to our Im∣perial Stirrup, and made Request, That the said <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants, coming into our Dominions, should pass under their Banner; which Request of both Ambassadors was granted under our Imperial Seal; notwitstanding <HI>Sinan Bassa,</HI> the Son of <HI>Cigala,</HI> Captain of the Sea, now deceased, as Admiral, and practised in Maritime Cases, having advised the Imperial Majesty, that it was fit and convenient that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation should be assigned to the Prote∣ction of the Ambassador of <HI>England,</HI> and that it should be so written in their Capitulations: which Opinion being by all the Viziers approved, by Ex∣press Order, and Imperial Authority, it was Com∣manded, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants of the Provin∣ces of <HI>Holland, Zealand, Friezland,</HI> and <HI>Guelderland;</HI> that is,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Strangers to come under the <HI>English</HI> Protection.</NOTE> the Merchants of those four Provinces, Tra∣ding in our Dominions, shall always come under the Banner of the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> as all other

<P>After which, there being arrived another Am∣bassador at this High Port, sent from the King of <HI>England</HI> with Letters and Presents, which were most acceptable, the said Ambassador did make Request, that certain other necessary Articles should be ad∣ded, and written in the Imperial Capitulations; of which the first was, As in Times past, in the Days of one of our Forefathers of famous memory, <HI>Sultan So∣liman Han,</HI> there was granted a certain Capitulation and Priviledge, That the Merchants of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation, <HI>Portugal, Ancona, Sevilla, Florence, Catalonia,</HI> and all sorts of <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> and other Merchant-Stran∣gers, might safely and securely go and come through all the Places of our Dominions, and Trade and Traffick; granting unto them moreover, that in any part of our Empire they might establish their Consuls: But it being that every Nation apart was not able to defray the Charges and Maintenance of a Consul, it was then left to their will and choice, to come under the Banner of such Ambassador or Consul as should best like them, provided that it were an Ambassador or Consul of a King in Peace and Amity with our High Port; upon which Grant, and other Priviledges given them, there were often granted divers Imperial Commands and Constitu∣tions,
<PB N="218" REF="112"/>being so desired by Merchant-Strangers, who of their own will elected to Trade under the Banner and Protection of the Ambassador and Consul of the King of <HI>England.</HI> And whilst in all Scales and Ports in these Parts, they had refuge to the Banner and Protection of the <HI>English</HI> Consuls: It seemeth that the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador by some means having a new gotten into their Capitulations, that the said Merchant-Strangers should come under their Ban∣ner, did endeavour to force them in all Scales to their Protection; for which cause the Controversie was again renewed and referred to our <HI>Divan,</HI> or Great Council, which after a due Examination, and a new Election, permitted to the will and choice of the said Merchants, they again did desire to be un∣der the Protection of the Ambassador of the King of <HI>England,</HI> notwithstanding it being made known to the Imperial Port, that as yet the <HI>French</HI> Ambassa∣dor did not desire to molest the said Merchants, nor to force them under his Protection, the first Article written in the <HI>French</HI> Capitulations, that the Mer∣chant-Strangers should come under their Protecti∣on, was by the Imperial Command made void and annulled: And to the end, that according to the ancient Custom of the said Merchant-Strangers, they should always come under the Banner and Pro∣tection of the Ambassador or Consuls of <HI>England;</HI> and that never hereafter they should be vexed or troubled by the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador in this Point, the said Ambassadors of his Majesty of <HI>England</HI> ha∣ving desired that this Particular should be written, and Enrolled in this new Imperial Capitulation, this present Article was accordingly Inserted, and by the Imperial Authority it is Commanded, That for ever in time to come, Merchants of the said
