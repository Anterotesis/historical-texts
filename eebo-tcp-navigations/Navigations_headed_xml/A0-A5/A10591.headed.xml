<HEAD>Late and admirable Newes, from the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and the Countrey of the great
<HI>Magor,</HI> testified by persons of great import, as shall appeare.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the yeare of our Lord 1618. and in the moneth of Iune, we arrived at the Cape of <HI>Good
hope,</HI> where we found the people of the Countrey, albeit Heathen and Idolaters, yet very kind
and friendly vnto vs, for some small quantitie of I∣ron and old Copper, we had of them vpon
exchange Beeues and Mutton. This Cape (otherwise called the Cape of <HI>Bona Speransa</HI>) is
very temperate, and agreeth well with the constitution of our people. Foure or fiue hundred
persons, sicke of the scurvie, and other diseases of the Sea, they all recovered their
health perfectly within a very few dayes.</P>
<P>They haue a very pleasant drinke, which they call <HI>Toddye,</HI> like in taste to white
Wine, which distelleth from the Pahneto trees. At our departure from this Cape we sayled two or
three dayes in a Sea like in collour to whey, whose bottome could not sound.</P>
<P>We came afterwards to the Countrey of the great <HI>Magor,</HI> or as some call him
<HI>Magull,</HI> his Lascar, which is his Traine, which followeth and alwayes goeth with him in
his progresses, consisteth vsually of
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>200000. people of all sorts. These lodge all in fayre Tents, richly hanged,
which being pitched accor∣ding to the order of that Countrey, they make a ve∣ry gorgeous and
glorious show, as of a most beauti∣full and large Cittie.</P>
<P>This <HI>Magor,</HI> hath a place called the <HI>Maoll,</HI> in which he keepeth a thousand
women to serue his lustfull desires.</P>
<P>When he maketh his progresse, his Concubines goe with him in all sumptuous maner, carried
vpon Elephants in Castles, richly covered, or vppon mens shoulders, in a frame made like the
vpper part of a Coach, but not so close covered. He hath vnder him 37. Provinces, and very many
goodly Citties: the length of his Countrey is 2800 myles: the breadth 1900 myles.</P>
<P>When he admitteth to his presence the Persian Embassador, or the Embassador of any
other migh∣tie King, when he giueth them either louing or kind speeches, or lookes, then the
Embassadors in token of thankfulnesse, kisse the earth. But Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> the
King of Great <HI>Brittaynes</HI> Embassador would not so much derogate from his place, to
abase himselfe so demissiuely. Notwithstanding, he was alwayes en∣tertained with more
and greater respects then any o∣ther Embassador.</P>
<P>This <HI>Magor,</HI> doth euery yeere weigh himselfe in a Ballance made for the purpose;
first, he weigheth himselfe with waights of Siluer, next he weigheth himselfe with waights of
Gold, and lastly, with Iewels, and precious stones: his waight of siluer, and gold, he giueth
away liberally at his pleasure, after
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>he is weighed, he mounteth into his Throne, and then he throweth amongst the
standers by, a great quantitie of Siluer and Gold, made hollow, like to the forme of Nutmeggs,
and such other Spices, which his Countrey doth afford. These ceremo∣nies being ended, then he
beginneth to Carowse and largely to drinke with his Nobles, till they be all drunke. The Scales
with which he is weighed, are all of massie Gold, richly beset with precious stones.</P>
<P>No man hath any Land in this <HI>Magors</HI> Countrey but himselfe, he giueth pentions and
taketh away pentions at his pleasure. No child inherits any thing which his Father had in
possession, but at the plea∣sure of <HI>Magor:</HI> all Honor and Gentilitie dyeth with
the person who had any, and returnes backe to the <HI>Magor.</HI></P>
<P>He sheweth himselfe in publike and open maner to the people, at the least, three times in
a day; first, at the Sunne-rising, to which he maketh low Reue∣rence. Secondly, at noone, at
which time he seeth Elephants fight, or some other pastimes prouided for him. Thirdly, before
the Sunne set, but when the Sunne is setting he descendeth from his Throne, and sheweth as
low obey¦sance as he did at the rising.</P>
<P>At all these times, whosoeuer commeth vnto him as a Sutor, vseth no other meanes for his
dispatch, but to hold vp a paper in his hand, and he is heard immediately, and encountreth the
best fortune which Sutors can desire, for either he presently ob∣taineth his Sute, or hath a
present deniall; there are no masters of Requests, nor any delatory references vpon any
petition.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<P><HI>Magors</HI> people are gouerned by no other lawes but what lie in his breast, and the
breasts of his coun∣sellors, yet there is no place where businesses are sooner
dispatched, or where Iustice is more vpright∣ly and vnpartially ministred.</P>
<P><HI>Cursero,</HI> the eldest Sonne of <HI>Magor,</HI> being of an haughtie and aspiring
Spirit, practised to take from his Father both Crowne and kingdome, but <HI>Magor</HI> not onely
tooke his sonne prisoner, but with him some 2000. of his chiefest followers, having taken
his sonne, he placed him to see the execution of those two thousand he had taken. The
manner of the execution being terrible, for they were put into the ground vpon sharpe stakes,
and so left to dye. After this execution, <HI>Magor</HI> shut vp and sealed his sonnes
eyes, so that for three yeares he saw no light of Sunne or Moone at all: seaven yeares he
kept him in close Prison, but at this time he hath a little more liberty. This Prince is of a
different disposition from his Father, for he keepeth but one wife, and is a great fauourer and
protector of Christians; he is generally beloued of all men. <HI>Magor</HI> will not vndertake,
nor do any businesse of import, but as he shall be directed and counsailed by his
Astrologers, and Magitians, when they tell him the day and houre are fortunate then hee
adventureth vpon any thing, hee cannot endure to heare any talke or mention made of Death which is
the most desperate and greatest follie which our age can or doth afford, nay what
madnesse is it? not to heare talke, nor make provision for that which cannot bee avoyded. God
hath pointed nothing more certaine then Death, because wee should ever
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>consider of it; and nothing more vncertaine, then the houre of Death; because
every houre we should be provided for it. <HI>Magor</HI> being much delighted, with
Astrologers, Magitians, and Witches, of which his Country is replenished, there came vpon a
time one of that Crue vnto him, and presented vnto him an Ape; telling <HI>Magor,</HI> that the
Ape could doe strange and admirable <HI>Tricks:</HI> well quoth <HI>Magor</HI> we will make
tryall of your Apes skill, and cunning, &amp; thereupon commanded the Ape and her Master to be
carried out of that roome, into another that they might not see what was done, in their absence
<HI>Magor</HI> tooke a Ring from his finger, &amp; hauing al∣wayes about him a great number of
Boyes, some 200. or thereabouts, <HI>which hee keepeth for vnnaturall and beastly vses,</HI>
he gaue the Ring to one of the Boyes and bad him hide it, then these Boyes flocking to∣gether,
the Ape and his Master were called for: now quoth <HI>Magor</HI> let your Ape trie her skill, I
haue lost my Ring, let vs see if shee can finde it; the Apes Master commanded the Ape to
fetch the Ring, the Ape went immedidately to the Boy which had the Ring and tooke it out of his
bosome and brought it to <HI>Magor.</HI></P>
<P>Who wondring much at it, he caused the second time the Ape and her master to retire out of
sight, and in their absence, hee caused his Secretary to write in severall papers, the
Names of some twelue or fourteene, of the greatest Gods, and Prophets which either were heard
or knowne to be worship∣ped, either in his Countrey or in any place of the World, which being
written, they were mingled
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>on an heape and layd vpon a table, Then the Ape was called for, and commanded to
take the Name of the greatest God &amp; truest Prophet from amongst those papers, the Ape
went presently to the Papers, and turning them vp, from amongst them all, one∣ly tooke out the
Name of Iesus and delivered it to <HI>Magor,</HI> wherupon <HI>Magor</HI> and the rest of his
Nobles, were much amazed: but vppon secret conference amongst themselues, they resolved to
make further tryall: whereupon the Master and the Ape were commaunded to goe to a further roome,
and some persons commanded to watch them, that the suspi∣tion, of all deceiueable courses
might be taken a∣way, and cleered: the papers were written againe with the same Names, and more
were added, which being done; the Ape was called for the second time, and to make choyce as
formerly shee had bin directed, shee presently went to the papers and made the same choyce,
which before shee had done: which stroke <HI>Magor</HI> and his Nobles in a greater a∣maze then
at the first: notwithstanding a third tryall was made, but with the like &amp; same
successe, where∣upon a great Noble man humbly besought <HI>Magor</HI> that hee might make
the fourth tryall, which was graunted him, this great man was called <HI>Mattolet Chan,</HI> which
in their Language signifieth (the belo∣ved Lord) Hee caused the Names to be written the fourth
time, and mingled together, and cast in a heape vpon the Table, the Ape was called as for∣merly
shee had beene, and commanded to make choyce of the greatest God or Prophet, whose name was
conteined in those papers. The Ape went pre∣sently
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>to the heape, and slightly and scornefully tur∣ned them over, but tooke vp no
paper but returned to her master. <HI>Magor</HI> and his Nobles wondred more at this then of what
passed before, and asked the Apes master, what might be the cause why the Ape would not
bring any paper as before shee had done, but turned them vp in so scornefull a maner, perhaps
quoth the master, the name which the Ape looketh for, is not there amongst them; then the
papers be∣ing examined, the name of <HI>Iesus</HI> was missing, now quoth <HI>Magor,</HI> let
the Ape shew cunning to fetch that paper, wherein that name is written. The Ape receiuing her
command, made present hast to <HI>Mat∣tolet Chan,</HI> and leapt vpon him, and withall thrust
her hand into his bosome, and drew out the name of <HI>Iesus,</HI> which shee brought
hastily to <HI>Magor.</HI> This being so strange an accident, was wondred at of all the
standers by, whereof some were Iewes, some Ma∣hometans, some Christians, with others.
This hath beene averred to be true, by master <HI>Edward Terry,</HI> Preacher to Sir <HI>Thomas
Roe,</HI> who heard it credibly reported, as aforesaid. And Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> hath
re∣ported the same for truth to sundry right honorable parsonages. Master <HI>Terry</HI>
the Preacher hath often seene the Ape.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Magor,</HI> and generally all the <HI>Indians</HI> of his Countrey are giuen over
to fleshly pleasures: they may, and doe keepe as many wiues and concubines as they will, or are
able to maintaine. What misery doe these <HI>Indians</HI> endure, to haue so many women
a∣bout them, when as there be many English men are grieuously vexed to haue the company but of
one.
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>But perhaps the <HI>Indian</HI> women are of a farre milder temper then the
English, as hereafter shall be shewed. The <HI>Indians</HI> are more jealous of their women
and wiues, then either Spanyards, or Italians. The Father will not trust his sonne, after he
commeth to twelue yeares of Age, except he be gelded. The <HI>Indian</HI> wo∣men in their houses
are commonly covered, and if any woman goe abroad vncovered, shee is reputed a Whore.</P>
<P><HI>Magors</HI> subiects are tall, and of comely personage, but of a tawnie coullor, but
they are faint hearted; <HI>Magor</HI> will vsually say, that one Portingall will beate three
of his subiects, and one English man will beate three Portingalls. In this Countrey there are
many seuerall Sects, some called <HI>Banians,</HI> who will kill nothing that hath life, no not
so much as snakes. They haue Hospitalls to keepe and cure lame Hor∣ses, lame Doggs, lame
Birds, or any lame Creature, and when they be cured, they are set at libertie. The manner of that
Countrey is to burne the bo∣dies of the dead, and the wiues willingly burne with their husbands.
But of late the women beginne to breake that custome.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> vnder <HI>Magor,</HI> worship euill fauoured vgly Idolls, which they
call, <HI>Pagods:</HI> their Priests are called <HI>Ioggis,</HI> or <HI>Bramines;</HI> their
Church they call <HI>Muskitts;</HI> they goe on Pilgrimage to seuerall places; Some to
<HI>Mecha</HI> in Arabia; Some to the Head of the Riuer <HI>Ianges,</HI> wherein they throw
sil∣uer and gold, according to their abilities, and after wash themselues in the River, and
then they thinke they are pure and cleane from all sinne.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<P>These people haue many feasts, and many fasts, which they keepe with sundry idle
Ceremonies, some of them mourne in blew, others as <HI>Iapa∣ners,</HI> mourne in white. They are
skilfull in Phy∣sicke, especially, in Simples.</P>
<P>The learning which they haue, which is but small, is in the Mathematicks, and in Naturall
Phylosophy; they haue small store of Bookes, be∣cause there is no Printing amongst them;
all their Bookes are Manuscripts.</P>
<P>Their vulgar speech is called <HI>Industan.</HI> The speech at <HI>Magors</HI> Court, is
vsually the Persian Language. Their learned tongue is the Arabian; the common people are very
apt to immitate any thing which they see to be done by Strangers.</P>
<P>I cannot let passe a strange and wonderfull re∣port which fell out in <HI>Magors</HI>
Court, and hath beene by Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> reported confidently for Truth. There was a
<HI>Rasa,</HI> (so great Princes are called,) who was an absolute Atheist, who would
alwayes scornefully, and disdainefully speake and dispute against the Deitie, not
enduring eyther himselfe, or any other, where hee might oppose to acknowledge any God-head.
This great Prince sporting himselfe among his Concubines, one of them who was most fauoured
of the Prince, and might bee most bold with him, when hee was flouting, and iesting against
the Deitie, pluckt from his breast an hayre, and withall a droppe of blood followed, which was
not regarded at all at the first; This very place within very fewe dayes beganne to fester, and
by degrees
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>grew to that extremitie, that the paine was intolle-rable, and withall prouing
to be a Gangrene; having vsed all the meanes, which Physicke, or Surgery might afford him, it
proued irrecoverable. This <HI>Ra∣sa</HI> seeing his estate, and that he had no hope of life,
but a dreadfull expectation of imminent death, sent to <HI>Magor</HI> to take his leaue of him,
<HI>Magor</HI> sent divers of his Nobles vnto him, to comfort him, with all the best offers and
speeches which any subiect might de∣sire from so mightie a Monarch. Which when the Nobles
had delivered vnto him, he made answere in this manner; My Lord <HI>Magor,</HI> is a great
Monarch to command vpon earth, but there is a more omnipo∣tent Monarch, which hath absolute
command and power in Heauen and Earth. You all know, I was an opposer, an enemy, a contemner of
all Deitie, and against that omnipotent Maiestie of Heauen. He hath now shewed and
manifested his power and Iustice vpon me, who now lye in torment, euery minute of an houre
expecting to die. What I would not acknowledge in my life, I am constrained to ac∣knowledge and
confesse vpon my death, for wee which liue at randome, and speake at large in our liues, when
death worketh natures dissolution, wee are then compelled to change our former opinions, and to
acknowledge our former errors. I was an A∣theist, by my owne experience I dare and can assure
you, what is one of the greatest causes of Atheisme; wicked liues doe wish, there were no
God to punish their offences after this life, and therefore doe flatter themselues in their
life; they frame to themselues all the reasons they can deuise, to perswade themselues
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>there is no God. But my Lords, there is no Atheist which dare at the houre of
his death maintaine and defend that Doctrine of Atheisme, which he did in life, for nature it
selfe doth constraine them to a terri∣ble recantatiō at the houre of death, as you may now
behold a grieuous example in me: what would not I giue? what would not I do? my Lords if I might
haue longer time of life to acknowledge &amp; confesse free∣ly and plainely that God head,
which formerly I haue with scorne and malice so wickedly denied: who would haue imagined that I
being a Souldier should not rather haue died vpon some honorable wound, given by sword or
launce; then so shame∣fully to die vpon the plucking of one hayre from my breast, this kind
of death, as it is most shame∣full to me, so it doth more manifest, and illustrate the
Divine power to bee most Omnipotent and miraculous. My Lords, my vitall powers doe faile mee, I
can speake no more, onely this for a fare∣well, which I pray you deliver also to my great
Soveraigne <HI>Magor,</HI> doe you all flie and take heede of Atheisme, seeke out with all the
care and dili∣gence you can, thou knowledge of the onely true and Omnipotent God, dare not liue
those wicked liues, nor maintaine those horrible opinions whilest you are in health, which as
you see most manifest∣ly in me are so terrible and horrible at this houre of my death;
having ended these words, this migh∣ty Prince dyed.</P>
<P>From <HI>Magors</HI> Countrey wee sayled towardes o∣ther Ilands, and arrived at an Iland
called <HI>Zeloon,</HI> which Iland yeeldeth Cinnamon, and other spices
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>in great aboundance, it yeeldeth also Pearles, Ru∣bies, Saphires, Garnets, and
sundry other pretious stones.</P>
<P>From <HI>Zeloon</HI> wee arrived at an Iland called <HI>Sam∣matra,</HI> which yeeldeth Pepper,
Gold, Beniamin, Camphire, with sundry other Rich Commodities, afterwards we sayled to
<HI>Patanie,</HI> an Iland governed by a Mayden Queene.</P>
<P>From this wee arrived at <HI>Iapan,</HI> which is one of the greatest and goodliest Ilands
of the World, ha∣ving great store of Gold Mines, and of Silver, they haue Silver, of three
sorts all vnstamped, they haue small plate, which goeth in the market for buying of
victuales: they haue other peeces of plate vn∣stamped, more finer Silver, and that goeth in the
Country, to buy all other commodities; they haue a third sort of plate, finer silver then any
Spanish money, and this is carried away by Strangers.</P>
<P>This Countrey is Governed by an Emperour, who hath vnder him 62. Kings, the Revenews of this
Emperour are infinite, a great part raised by Rice, the People of this Countrey are proud and
haughty, very warlike, yet exceeding obedient to their Emperour, and the Kings, to whom they are
Subiects. They are very kinde to Strangers: Iustice, in this country is severe without
partialitie; Theeues are not imprisoned but presently executed, If a murther be committed, and
the murtherer escape, hee who apprehendeth him, hath 300. pounds gi∣ven him vpon the deliverie of
the murtherer; so that fewe or none of the murtherers escape present exe∣cution: In this
Countrey a man may walke without
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>danger all houres of the night, so he doe not misse∣behaue himselfe. If
any controversie arise betwixt partie and partie, it is foorthwith decided, their Lawes are
<HI>Leges talionis,</HI> Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, Hand for Hand, and Life for life, they
wor∣shipp and pray all to a Saint, called <HI>Ameda,</HI> whom they esteeme to bee a Mediator
be∣twixt God and them; when a Souldier dieth, they are perswaded hee go∣eth presently to
<HI>Ottango Fatech∣man</HI> the God of Warre.</P>
