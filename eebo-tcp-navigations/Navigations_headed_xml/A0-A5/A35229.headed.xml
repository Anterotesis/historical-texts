<P>IT is a saying, That the greatest Diver∣tisement to a Souldier or Traveller, is to discourse of their former Dangers and Adventures; And if the relating of them be so pleasant, certainly the hearing thereof is no less divertive. Now in this little Volume you may meet with variety of Accidents of all kinds, for here you may see on the one side <HI>Pompous Greatness</HI> laid as low as <HI>Contempt</HI> it self, and on the other hand <HI>Baseness</HI> and <HI>Obscurity</HI> raised up to <HI>amazing</HI> and <HI>Prodigious Heights;</HI> Here you may find some such noble Spirits, that they could not rest satisfied, till by their own hazards they had discovered <HI>New Worlds,</HI> and brought one Hemisphere to some Acquaintance with the other; Here you may observe, That though a∣mongst the <HI>Romans</HI> the Temple of Honour was so contrived, that therein was no Passage to it but through that other of <HI>Virtue,</HI> yet that things are far otherwise than they ought to be, and that Virtue is as familiarly persecuted as rewarded, nor have Persons of worth been al∣ways barely beholden to their Merit for their Preferment, but perhaps some petty Accident, or inconsiderable Circumstance hath been the occasion of their Advancement. Here you may remark, That as some men who have receiv∣ed the Sentence of Condemnation in themselves,
<PB REF="3"/>
have had unlook'd for Deliverance, and have miraculously escaped when in all Humane Rea¦son they might be numbred among the Dead; So others have been the hasteners of their own Downfalls and Destruction, and have made their own Graves with their own Tongues, by their Temerity and rashness in Talking; Here lastly we may be seriously inform'd, that their is no Creature so small and inconsiderable in our Eyes, but if the Almighty please may be able to afflict, yea and ruine us, when we are in the fulness of our sufficiency; These with a multitude of other Instances of various natures and kinds are the subject matter of this small Treatise, which being duly contemplated are sufficient proofs to a considering Mind of a Su∣periour and Divine Power, that visibly disco∣vers it self in the Occurrences and Transacti∣ons of this lower World, and disposes of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Things</HI> as it pleaseth, even beyond either their Hopes or Fears; and if the Perusal of these Stupendious Examples produce such a real Belief in the Reader, the Publisher will think himself sufficiently recompenced for his Labour and Pains; and may conclude with the Poet, That
<Q><L>Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci</L>

<HEAD>Extraordinary Adventures, Discoveries and Events.</HEAD>
<P>THE Surprizing Adventures and Events that daily assail Mankind, are so Nu∣merous and Extraordinary, that no∣thing seems more inseparable to our Mortal state, than constant and continual Vicissitudes, Changes and Altera∣tions; But since we find in History, that some more Remarkable Accidents have happened to some Pla∣ces and Persons than to others, it must needs be ve∣ry delightful among such a multitude of Instances, to give an Account of the most Considerable Relati∣ons I have met with in many credible Writers, and that is the design of this small Tract; wherein I shall not so much regard the Method, Order, or other Cir∣cumstances of an exact Historian, as in the whole to divert the Reader with what may be both pleasant and profitable, wherein it may be he may more fully inform himself of several matters, which he had for∣merly heard of, but yet did not so cleerly understand; This without any further Preface is that which I now aim at, wherein I will impose nothing upon any mans belief, but leave every one at his full Liberty what de∣gree of Faith he will exercise therein, it being suffi∣cient that I have cited my Authors, who are generally such as have been accounted Men of Veracity and Ho∣nesty
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
in the Accounts they give, and may therefore challenge as much Credit as is due to any Humane History.</P>
<P N="1">I. Strange were the Adventures of <HI>Christopher Colum∣bus,</HI> who discovered a <HI>New World</HI> in the last Age, which is now called <HI>America;</HI> He was born at <HI>Nervi</HI> in the Seigniory of <HI>Genoa,</HI> who being a man of excellent A∣bilities; and born to undertake great matters, could not perswade himself, but that, considering the Mo∣tion of the Sun, there must needs be another World to which that Glorious Planet did impart both his Life, and Heat, when he went from us; This World he purposed to seek after, and in 1486 he discovered his Design to the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> who rejecting his Proposals, he sent his Brother <HI>Bartholomew</HI> to King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh of <HI>England,</HI> who in his Voyage hi∣ther unhappily fell into the hands of Pyrates, by whom he was long kept Prisoner, but having at last obtained his Liberty, he repaired to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> where he found such cheerful entertainment at the hands of that King, that <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> was sent for to come thither also; But <HI>Christopher</HI> not know∣ing of his Brothers Imprisonment, and not hearing from him, conceived the offer of his service to have been neglected, and thereupon made his desires known at the Court of <HI>Castile,</HI> where after many de∣lays, and six years attendance upon the business, he was at last furnished with three ships only, and those not for Conquest but Discovery.</P>
<P>With this small strength he sailed on the Ocean sixty dayes, and yet could see no land, so that the discontented <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to Mutiny, and refused to move a foot forward; Just at which time it hap∣ned that <HI>Columbus</HI> discerned the Clouds to carry a cleerer colour than they did before, and therefore intreated them to expect only three days longer, in which time, if they saw not land he promised to re∣turn; Toward the end of the third day, one of the Company descried Fire, which was an evident token
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
that they drew near to some shore; The Place they discovered was an Island on the Coast of <HI>Florida</HI> cal∣led by <HI>Columbus</HI> St. <HI>Salvador;</HI> Having Landed his Men, he caused a Tree to be cut down, and made a Cross thereof which he set up neer the place where he came on Land, and by that Ceremony took Possessi∣on of the <HI>New World</HI> for the Kings of <HI>Spain, Octob.</HI> 11. 1492. Afterwards he discovered and took Pos∣session of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and with much Treasure and Content returned to <HI>Spain,</HI> and was preferred by the King for this good Service, first to be Admiral of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and in conclusion to the Title of the Duke <HI>De la Vega</HI> in the Island of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> The next year he was furnished with 18 Ships for further Discovery; in this second Voyage he discovered the Islands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and built the Town of <HI>Isabella,</HI> after called <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> from whence for some severities used against the mutinous <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he was sent Prisoner to <HI>Castile,</HI> but very honourably entertained, and cleared from all Crimes imputed to him.</P>
<P>In 1497. he began his Third Voyage; in which he discovered the Countries of <HI>Paria</HI> and <HI>Cumana</HI> on the <HI>firm Land,</HI> with the Islands of <HI>Cubagna,</HI> and <HI>Mar∣garita,</HI> and many other Islands, Capes and Provinces; In 1500 he began his fourth and last Voyage, in the course whereof coming to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> he was unwor∣thily denied entrance into the City of <HI>Domingo,</HI> after which scowring the Sea-Coasts, he returned back to <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Spain,</HI> where six years after he died, and was buried Honourably at <HI>Sevil,</HI> where to this day an Epitaph remaineth on his Tomb, far short of his merit, which is to this purpose.</P>

<P><HI>Columbus</HI> dying left two Sons behind him, of which the youngest called <HI>Ferdinand</HI> died unmarried, the the eldest named <HI>Diego,</HI> succeeded his Father in the Admiralty of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the Dukedom of <HI>Vega,</HI> and married the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI>'s Daughter, but hav∣ing no issue by her, he spent the greatest part of his Estate in Founding a famous Library in <HI>Sevil,</HI> which he furnished with Twelve thousand Volumes, and en∣dowed with a liberal Revenue to maintain the same; But though his Family be extinct, yet his Fame shall live renowned to all Posterities, as the first Discover∣er of this <HI>New World,</HI> and consequently the greatest and most Fortunate Advancer of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monar∣chy, though in his life-time so envied and maligned by most of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that <HI>Bobadilla</HI> being sent into those parts for redress of Greivances, loaded him with Irons, and returned him Prisoner into <HI>Spain;</HI> Nor did they only endeavour to deprive him of the honour of this Discovery after his Death, by pre∣tending that he had seen the Charts and Descriptions of some unknown <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but in his Life-time they would often say, <HI>That it was a matter of no such difficul∣ty to have found these Countreys, and that if he had not done it then, some body else would have done it for him;</HI> But he confuted their peevishness by this modest Ar∣tifice, desiring some of them who had insolently e∣nough contended with him about this Discovery to make an Egg stand firmly upon one of its ends, which when after many Trials they could not do, he gently bruising one end of it, made it stand upright, letting

them see thereby without any further reprehension, how easie it is to do that thing which we see ano∣ther do before us. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s <HI>Cosmography Lib.</HI> 4.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Columbus</HI> having thus led the way, was second∣ed by <HI>Americus Vespusuis,</HI> an adventurous <HI>Florentine,</HI> employed therein by <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> in 1501 on a design to find out a nearer way to the <HI>Molucca</HI>'s than by the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> who though he passed no further than the <HI>Cape,</HI> without having so much as a sight of the great River <HI>De la Plata,</HI> which washeth the South parts of that Countrey, yet from him (to the Great Injury and neglect of the first Discoverer) the <HI>Continent</HI> or <HI>Main Land</HI> of this Countrey hath the name of <HI>America,</HI> by which it is still known and commonly called; To him succeeded <HI>John Cabot</HI> a <HI>Venetian</HI> in the behalf of King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh of <HI>England,</HI> who discovered all the North-East Coasts thereof from the Cape of <HI>Florida</HI> in the South to New-foundland in the North, causing the <HI>American</HI> Royale's or little Kings to turn Homagers to the King and Crown of <HI>England.</HI> After whom there followed di∣vers private Adventurers and Undertakers out of all parts of <HI>Europe</HI> bordering on the Ocean; <HI>Ferdinando Magellanus</HI> was the first that compassed the whole World, and found the South Passage called <HI>Fretum Magellanicum,</HI> or the <HI>Magellan Streights</HI> to this day. <HI>Heylin's Cosmog.

<P N="3">III. But the most famous of all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (as I suppose saith <HI>P. Jovius</HI>) for the Discovery of New Lands and People, was <HI>Ferdinando Cortesius,</HI> or <HI>Cor∣ter,</HI> to whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> stand indebted for the Kingdom of <HI>Mexico;</HI> He was born in <HI>Medeline</HI> a Town of <HI>Estremadura</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> 1485, and in the 19 year of his Age, employed himself in the Trade, and busi∣ness of <HI>America</HI> for the improvement of his Fortune; In 1511, he went as Clerk to the Treasurer for the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where he so well husbanded his Affairs by carrying over Kine, Sheep and Mares, and bring∣ing Gold for them in Exchange, that in short time
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
he very much improved his stock, and now resolv∣ing to venture all his Credit both in Friends and Mo∣ney, he furnished himself with eleven Ships, and with 550 Men, set sail from <HI>Spain,</HI> and arrived at the Island of <HI>Santa Cruce,</HI> and sailing up the River <HI>Tabasco</HI> sacked the Town of <HI>Pontoncon,</HI> the Inhabitants refu∣sing to sell him Victuals; After this, by the help of his Horse and Ordinance, he discomfited forty Thou∣sand of the naked <HI>Indians,</HI> who were gathered toge∣ther to revenge themselves for the plundering their Town; he then received the King thereof in Vassal∣lage to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Being told that Westward he should meet with some Mines of Gold, he turned his Course for the Haven of St. <HI>John de Ʋlloa,</HI> where landing he was entertained by the Governor of <HI>Montezuma</HI> King of <HI>Mexico,</HI> who understanding of his coming, and that he was a Servant of so Great an Emperor as <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, he sent him many rich Presents both of Gold and Silver; <HI>Cortez</HI> inflamed at the sight thereof, resolved to go unto the place where such Treasures were, and took Possession of the Countrey in the Name of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Emperor of <HI>Germany;</HI> and building there the Town <HI>De la Crux,</HI> he left 150 of his men therein, and attended with only 400 Foot, 15 Horsemen, and 6 pieces of Ordinance, he pursued his Enter∣prize, and having cunningly gained to his assistance those of <HI>Zempoallan, Tlascala,</HI> who were ill affected to <HI>Montezuma,</HI> he marched on toward <HI>Mexico,</HI> plundring in his way the Town of <HI>Chololla</HI> consisting of Forty Thousand Housholds; He was kindly received into <HI>Mexico</HI> by the affrighted King, whom he caused to ac∣knowledge himself a Vassal to <HI>Spain,</HI> and to present him in the name of a Tribute with so much Trea∣sure as amounted to an hundred and threescore thou∣sand <HI>Castellins</HI> of Gold; A quarrel growing not long after, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were driven out of the Town; But <HI>Cortez</HI> aided with the whole Forces of the <HI>Tlas∣calans,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
and a recruit of more <HI>Spaniards,</HI> sent thither upon a design against himself) he made up an Army of an hundred Thousand <HI>Indians,</HI> 900 <HI>Spanish</HI> Foot, 80 Horse, 17 pieces of Ordinance, and having with great Diligence made ready a Navy of 13 Galliots, and 6000 Canoes or Boats, he laid siege to <HI>Mexico</HI> by Sea and Land, wherein the Admirable Courage of that King is very remarkable, for having for three Moneths most valiantly defended the City, and en∣dured therein all manner of inconveniencies, he was at the taking thereof unhappily delivered up alive into the hands of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> his Enemies, upon condition to be used as became a King, during his Imprisonment he said or did nothing but what be∣came that Title, but after the Victory, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> not finding that quantity of Gold which they had promised themselves, though they had left no place unsearcht to discover it, they then proceeded by the most cruel and horrible Tortures, to force those Pri∣soners they had taken to confess where they had hid it.</P>
<P>But unable to prevail this way, finding the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> hearts more strong than their Torments, they thereby grew so inraged, that contrary to all Law of Nations, and against their solemn Vows and Pro∣mises, they condemned the King himself, and one of the Chiefest Princes of his Court to the Rack in the sight of each other; The Prince being encompassed with hot burning Coals, and being overcome with the ex∣traordinary Torment, at last turned his dying Eyes in a most lamentable manner toward his Master, as if he begged his Pardon that he could endure the pain no longer; The King fixing his Eyes fiercely upon him, seemed to upbraid him with pusillanimi∣ty and want of Courage, and with a stern, and setled voice spoke thus to him, <HI>What? Supposest thou that I am in a cold Bath? Am I at more ease than thou art?</HI> Whereat the miserable Prince immediately fainted under the Torture, and gave up the Ghost. The
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
King being half rosted was carried away, not so much for Pity, for what Compassion could enter in∣to such Barbarous Wretches, who only upon suppo∣sing to get some odd Vessel or piece of Gold, would broyl a Man to death before their Eyes; and not only a Man, but a King, and a King of such mighty Grandeur and Renown; but because his undaunted Constancy baffled their inhuman Cruelties, they after∣ward hanged him for Couragiously attemping by Arms to deliver himself from his long Captivity and misera∣ble subjection; and thus he ended his wretched life. Wonderful even to Amazement was the Magnificence of the famous Cities of <HI>Cusco,</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI> and ad∣mirable the Curiosities of this King, who had all the Trees, Fruits, Herbs, Plants according to their Order and full bigness in the Garden, most Artifici∣ally framed in Gold; He had likewise in his Cabinet all the Living Creatures that his Countrey or his Seas produced cast in Gold, besides abundance of exquisite Works in Precious Stones, Feathers, Cot∣ton, and Painting. After a siege of three Moneths <HI>Mexico</HI> was Taken, Plundered and Burnt, <HI>Aug.</HI> 13. 1521. but afterward rebuilt more beautifully than before, and thus fell this mighty Kingdom into the hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by the Valour and good For∣tune of <HI>Cortez</HI> a private Adventurer, who was rewar∣ded for that Service by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, with many fair Estates in the Province of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and dignified with the Title of Marquess <HI>de Valla.

<P><HI>Atabaliba</HI> came with Twenty five Thousand un∣armed Men in Ostentation of his greatness, and with∣out any design of making resistance, of which this treacherous <HI>Pizarro,</HI> taking the advantage, picked a quarrel with him, and suddenly charged upon him with his Horse, and Ordnance, slaying his Guard without resistance, and coming neer the Kings Per∣son, who was carried upon mens Shoulders upon Rafters or Beams of Massy Gold, in a Chair of State also all of Gold, they killed several of the Bearers to make him fall, endeavouring to take him alive, but as soon as one of them fell another presently succeed∣ed in his place, so that he could never be brought

The wretched King they set at so excessive a ransom as ex∣exceedeth all belief, which though he truly paid, and though by his Conversation he had given appa∣rent Signs of a great and undaunted Soul, and of a generous and ingenious Mind, yet these insolent Conquerours having exacted from him an House piled upon all sides with Gold and Silver, amounting to a Million three hundred Twenty five thousand and five Hundred pound weight in Gold, besides the sil∣ver and other precious things which came to as much more, so that even their Horses were shod with Massy Gold; yet they Villainously and Traiterously contrived a false Accusation against him, pretending that he designed to raise his Subjects against them for procuring his Liberty, upon which they condem∣ned him to be publickly hanged and strangled, hav∣ing first made him to be baptized as he went to Ex∣ecution, thereby to prevent the Torment of being burned alive, wherewith they threatned him; He took his Death patiently, and with a Royal Gravity and undismayed Constancy, without the least dis∣composure either in Words or Countenance.

<P><PB N="12" REF="9"/>Thus have we seen the deplorable Ends of Two of the most mighty and glorious Monarchs of this New World, and peradventure of all our Western parts, who were Kings over so many Kingdoms; And these are the cursed Fruits of Covetousness and Ambition, for which so many goodly Cities were ruined and destroyed, so many Nations made deso∣late, such infinite Millions of harmless innocent Peo∣ple of all Conditions, Sexes and Ages wofully Massa∣cred and Murdered, and the richest, fairest, and best part of the World turned to a <HI>Field of Bloud;</HI> And though we have the Vanity to call those Nations Barbarous who are not so wickedly knowing as our selves, yet the ingenious discourse and Replies of these naked <HI>Americans,</HI> shew that their Honesty, Truth and Integrity have been the chief occasions of ex∣posing them to the Slavery and Barbarity of these wicked Treacherous and Idolatrous <HI>Spanish</HI> Christi∣ans; of which it may not be amiss to give the fol∣lowing Instance.</P>

And as for their King, since he seemed to beg, he appear∣ed to be poor and needy; And for the Pope who had made that distribution, he seemed to be a man who loved mischief and dissention, in going about to give that to a third man which was none of his own, and so to make it questionable and raise quarrels among the ancient Possessors thereof; As for Victuals they should have part of their store; and for Gold they had but little, and that it was a thing they very little valued as being utterly unprofitable for the service of their lives, whereas all their care was to pass their time happily and pleasantly, and therefore what quantity soever they should find of it, except what was employed in the ser∣vice of their Gods they should freely take it; As touching one only God, the discourse of him had very well pleased them, but they were resolved by no means to change their Religion, in which they had so long time lived so happily; neither indeed did they use to take advice or Counsel but from their Freinds and Acquaintance; As concerning their high words, it was a sign of great want of Judgment to threaten those, whose nature, condition, strength and po∣wer was utterly unknown to them; And that therefore they should with all speed hasten out of their Countrey and Dominions, since they were used to take in good part the kindnesses and discourses of Strangers, but if they did not suddenly depart, they would deal with them as they had done with some others;</HI> shewing them the Heads of divers Persons lately executed, sticking upon Stakes about their City. <HI>Montaign</HI>'s <HI>Essays, Lib.</HI> 3.</P>

<P N="7">VII. Strange were the Adventures of one <HI>T.

Before I went I sold part of my Estate, and bought a Cargo of Goods of above 2000 pounds; with which and some Goods belonging to my Master I imbarqued in the River of <HI>Thames</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1648 in a Vessel of <HI>Hamburgh;</HI> the wind favoured us very much

out of the Channel, and though we met with contra∣trary Gusts we reached <HI>Cape St. Vincent</HI> in 20 days, designing to unload some Goods at <HI>Cales;</HI> when we came near the <HI>Cape,</HI> we espied two Ships to Wind∣ward making toward us, upon which we cleared our Decks, charged our Guns, and prepared all things for our defence, some imagined them to be <HI>French,</HI> because they put out <HI>French</HI> Colours, but when they came within half a League of us they discovered themselves to be <HI>Turks Men of War</HI> by their <HI>bloudy</HI> Co∣lours, which they put out instead of the <HI>white;</HI> Then began our Captain to be amazed, our Company to be affrighted, and every one to bestir himself; I ob∣served one Fellow who before had some disease in his Legs and Hands, much like the Gout, which made him hitherto useless, yet now in danger he skipped about, and handled the Guns as if nothing had ailed him. We had then aboard about an 100 men, with Passengers of several Nations, and 30 Great pieces of Ordnance, with other small Guns.</P>
<P>About seven afternoon, the <HI>Turks</HI> overtook us, and the foremost Vessel gave us a Broadside, the o∣ther followed, and saluted us in the same manner, and we returned them the like, the Fight was furious and Bloudy for four hours, our Men behaved themselves gallantly, neither Death nor wounds could force them from their Charge nor Posts, some when their Limbs were all bruised, their Bones shattered, and their Bodies all torn with Splinters, did obstinately continue to manage the Guns, every one resolved to dye with his weapons in his hands rather than to shrink in the least from the Fight. In this four hours we received near 50 Broadsides, and our Enemies were as obsti∣nate as we; Our number was at last reduc'd to eigh∣teen men, most of them wounded so that we could no longer resist the Numbers, and Fury of our Ene∣mies, who continued to pour in upon us great and small Shot, and withal our Ship was shot through between Wind and Water, which caused us to make

but weak resistance, and the <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving it, were afraid the Sea would at last swallow us and deprive them of their Booty, and therefore resolved to board us, grapling on both sides of us, and their men en∣tring, but we from our Fore-Castle and Steerage with our Murdering Pieces forced them back again, at last for fear our obstinacy should cause our Ship to sink under us, and deliver us into the hands of a more merciless enemy the raging Sea, we called for Quarter, which the <HI>Turks</HI> willingly gave, almost dis∣pairing of Success; We found near 300 of our Men killed, my self was shot through the Right Arm, and the Enemies ships were miserably rent and torn; One thing during the Fight I judged an ill Omen, that at a broadside, one great shot was forced back again, and split in pieces, which we conceived had met with a more violent one that had driven it upon us; The <HI>Turks</HI> treated us more generously than we could ex∣pect from Enemies whom we had angred by so long resistance, commending our Courage, and admiring our Resolution and when they saw the rich Loading they had gained, they soon pardoned the injuries we had done them.</P>
<P>The Captains of the <HI>Turks</HI> called to me and the Skipper for our <HI>Bills of Lading,</HI> which we were for∣ced to deliver; I made some Reflections on my for∣mer Condition, and wished my self, as poor as <HI>Job</HI> upon a Christian shore; Liberty was dear to me that was taken a slave, I remembred then that excellent advice, <HI>Trust not in uncertain riches;</HI> I then condem∣ned the Joy I had felt for the rich Patrimony that was left me, and the earnest desire to see Forreign Places, and sorrowfully recalled to mind my former Conditi∣on, but all these Reflections and Regrets could not turn the Wind, nor stop our Course towards <HI>Argiers</HI> where we were next bound, for we Christians who were left alive were disposed into the Enemies Ships, and stript of our best attire, which some lusty Rogues did us the kindness to wear for our sakes before our

Eyes; The dead bodies and those past Recovery were stript naked and sent to feed Sharks, and other ravenous Fishes of the Sea, which we saw at that in∣stant waiting as we thought, being it may be as sen∣sible of dead Bodies amongst us, as Vultures, who in these Countries constantly hover about a House or Tent, where sick People who will there infallibly die, are, in hopes to enjoy the Prey, the dead bodies be∣ing exposed to that purpose; we were used as civilly a Shipboard as we could expect from <HI>Turks,</HI> feeding with them on Garlick, Rusk, poor <HI>John,</HI> Rice and the like; I observed them very inquisitive to examine us apart about our Qualities, and Friends, which we were forewarned of, and therefore I perswaded all our Company to represent me as a poor Fellow, only intrusted by my Master, which satisfied them, till by discourse with some <HI>English Renegadoes,</HI> one of them suspected me; after which they set a higher value on me as expecting a greater ransom; we sailed into the <HI>Streights,</HI> and the next day Anchored in the Bay of <HI>Argiers;</HI> some Officers thereof coming to take notice of our number and the Price; One of them was a <HI>Cornish</HI> man, who by his Apostacy had got great wealth being a Trader in slaves, well knowing how to make advantage by his own Nation; He inquired in what part of <HI>England</HI> we were born, but I desired him as a Countryman to shew us some favour, and buy us for himself which he promised to do if we did give him hopes of returning our Money, to pre∣vent as he said our falling into severer hands to the endangering of our lives, since if we came on shore we should be led to the Market and sold like Horses, and might be bought by those that would use us in∣humanely, and exact from us the remainder of our Estates, but he being our Countryman would be our Friend, and take no more for us than it cost him if we would freely discover our selves to him; we with our Eyes on each other discovered how inclinable we were to comply with him, though we were som∣thing

Jealous of this <HI>Turks</HI> Faith, judging that he who was not True to his God, would scarce be so to us, which we afterward found too true, for those that were poor and had few friends were left to their ill Fortune, and the others the Owners set a high value on, so that we repeated our Credulity in this Wretch, but not agreeing on the Price we were set on shore.</P>
<P>Great Companies came flocking to see us, upon report of our Courage, some whose Relations had been slain, gave us such welcome as became the Cru∣elty and Impertinency of Heathens, loading us with Curses and Imprecations, and insulting strangely o∣ver us, so that had we not been guarded, we had been torn in pieces; a <HI>Spanish</HI> Renegado was so transport∣ed with rage for the loss of his Comrade of the same Nation, that he drew his Cymeter, and begged Li∣berty to sacrifice one of us, promising to pay his Ransom; which being denied, he then desired only cut off one of our ears, it chanced he came near one of us, and with a blow struck off a part of the Cheek of a <HI>German,</HI> which he greedily swallowed down, af∣firming that he never tasted so sweet a Morsel in his days, so strangely had Vengeance possest him, that he desired to feed upon us. But our keepers safely conveyed us into the City, where we found our Chains ready made waiting for us; Every one of us had a strong Chain about 20 pound weight linked to our Legs, and tied to our Girdles, that if we did medi∣tate an escape, it should not be without difficulty. In this strange Equipage we were conducted with our gin∣gling Chains to the Kings Palace, much wondring what they intended to do with us in a place of so much hon∣our. We past the first Guard, and came into a spacious Court paved with White Marble, whereof there is great quantity near old <HI>Carthage</HI> or <HI>Tunis</HI> in this Countrey, it was inclosed with a high brick Wall, wherein was a large Gate chequered with divers Co∣lours, which led us into a Great Hall, where we stay∣ed till the King of <HI>Argiers</HI> came to visit us, an honour
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
we did not expect, but it seems 'tis the Custom for him to view all the Slaves when they first land, out of whom he chuses for himself the Tenth Person, and likewise one more whom he pleases; we were placed round about the Hall ready for his coming in, which was not speedily, for being about Noon, he had been Bathing himself, and then taking another Recreation which is usual at that time of day in these hot Climates. About two a Clock in comes a lusty Officer clothed in Scarlet, with a Rod in his hand and a great Turbant about his head, who was the Kings Gentleman-Usher, followed by six Persons of good Meen and Appearance, armed with Scymi∣ters; Next came a Grave Fellow with a Turbant al∣most as big as our <HI>English</HI> half Bushel, at one side he had a set of Diamonds which did sparkle like his Eyes, his Garment was green, his Legs were bare, and on his feet he wore Sandals; we had time to observe him as he entred the door, for his pace was slow and Grave, I could have numbred 20 between every step; He marched in that manner to the upper end, where there was a Canopy of State over his Head, and two <HI>Turkey</HI> Carpets with a large Damask Pillow under him upon which he sate; then the Own∣ers of the Ships presented themselves before him, kissing the Hem of his Garment, they discoursed a∣mong themselves about an hour, and then presented the King (who only sate, all the rest standing about him) with a Considerable Present in Cloth and other rich Commodities; The King then veiwed every one of us with a Stern Countenance, and took notice of our Features and Stature, for the <HI>Turks</HI> are excellent in Physiognomy, and know a mans Temper and In∣clinations at first view as well as an expert Farrier does the good and ill Qualities of a Horse, which in∣deed concerns those who Trade in Slaves; He cast a Jest upon every one, which gave the Company a great deal of Mirth, but encreased our Sadness; He chose out of the Company my self, the Skipper,
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
and a pretty ruddy <HI>German</HI> Boy, which I wondred at, since he could expect no ransom for him, but I after understood the good old man was a great Lover of his pleasures, and therefore pitched on him to give him some in his old Age, a strange fancy pos∣sessing the Minds of all the <HI>Southern</HI> People, so that they burn with the Fire which consumed <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI></P>
<P>I was glad to be in possession of the King hoping to get my Freedom, who inquiring of my Quality, I told him I was a Cook, which he was glad of, as wanting one; but I proved a mad Cook, putting in sometimes Oyl instead of Vinegar, and Salt instead of Pepper, yet I handled my meat so nimbly, that they all believed I had been used to Cookery; But I lost my Place on this occasion; at a Feast my Master made, I had several sorts of Fishes that I never saw before, the Liver of one hath a most lothsome Taste, I thought it good in the Sauce, and therefore I sent it up stewed under the Fish, in a Dish garnished with Flowers; The Guests seeing such a pleasant Ap∣pearance, expected the Fish to be extraordinary, and prepared their Stomachs to feed thereon, neg∣lecting others much better, but tasting the Sauce they thought it a Sir reverence, and all began to spew and spit. I angered the King so much with this Master-peice of Cookery, that he ordered I should recieve ten Bastinado's for my Sallary, I vainly pre∣tending Ignorance and our Countrey Fashion, being forced to endure it with patience; For this, and be∣ing likewise Jealous of me about one of his Women, who was indeed very kind to me, he was resolved to part with me, and gave order I should be led into the Market-place, and there Sold; When I saw my self with an ill-favoured <HI>Turk,</HI> leading me with a Chain like a Horse or Bullock through the Streets I began to lament my hard Fate, doubting what surly Master I should have next; The <HI>Turk</HI> that led me, cried before me in <HI>Lingua Franca; Who will buy a
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
Christian? Who will buy a Christian?</HI> It was a grievous change of Fortune to be reduced in one year from my Fathers Honourable Estate to the lowest misery even that of a Slave, to be sold as a Beast in a strange Countrey where I had no Friends that durst own me. Their manner of selling slaves is thus, They lead them up and down the Market, and when any bids Money, they cry, <HI>a Rache, a Rache,</HI> that is, <HI>Here's so much money bidden, who bids more?</HI> The buyers are very subtle, and first look into their mouths, and a strong set of Grinders will much advance the price, arguing rati∣onally, That those who have no Teeth cannot eat, and they that cannot eat cannot work, and therefore are not for their turn, nor their Money; For they in∣tend to keep them at hard meat all the year, and therefore it must not be Gums but solid, and if pos∣sible case hardned Teeth that must chew it, and an Ostriches Stomach to digest it; next they feel their Limbs, whether any Fracture or Dislocation, which will much lower the price; and therefore to be clean Limbed, close Coupled, and well joynted, will ad∣vance it as much; The Age is also very considerable, but the Slaves not being obliged to discover it, and they not breeding them that sell them, they judge by the Face, Hair or Beard, but a good set of Teeth will make one 10 years younger, and a bad set as much older; The seller commends his Goods to the sky; O says he, <HI>Mark what a Back he has, what a breadth between the Shoulders, what a Chest! how strong set! how fitted on purpose for Burdens, He'l do but e'ne too much work;</HI> The Buyer on the other hand as much undervalues him, <HI>Pish,</HI> sayes he, <HI>he looks like a Pilli∣ard, a very Meacock at his Provender, and one that seems to be surfeited.</HI> But they are very curious in examining the Hands, for if they be hard and brawny, they will shrewdly guess they have been inured to Labour, if delicate and tender, they will suspect him to be some Merchant, and then the hopes of a good price for Redemption makes him saleable; When any are sold
<PB N="23" REF="14"/>
they must be brought back once more to the Kings Palace that he may view them again, and if he likes any at the prizes they went off at, there is no more dispute, they are his own.</P>
<P>When I was come into the Market-Place, a Fel∣low offers my Keeper money for me, and several o∣thers came about me, and among the rest that ill-na∣tured <HI>Englishman</HI> aforementioned, I trembled for fear of falling into his hands, knowing how cruelly he had handled some of my Comrades; My keeper made advantage of the Croud, and asked an 100 Dollars more for me than he was ordered; The first who seemed by his looks to be a good Man, though of no great appearance would not let me slip out of his hands, but paid the Money, and led me to a House next the <HI>Grand Mosque</HI> or Church of the City, neer the Kings Palace; My loving Lady having employed this Fellow to buy me for her Service, became very devout after my coming to that place, seldom missing a day without coming to her Devotions at the Mos∣quette, from whence there was a Passage into my Lodgings. By this frequent and constant attendance at Publick Prayer, she purchased a great esteem with the People, and a favour with her Husband, and ever after she was counted a Saint, I continued her Slave about two years, imploying my self in some Slavish work, but not above measure, so that I had opportu∣nity to view the City of <HI>Argiers,</HI> and took special no∣tice of many remarkable particulars.</P>
<P>It is a City not so large as populous, Fortified by Art and Nature, the Walls are sixty foot high, and in some places 70 or 80; Built with square Stones or Flints about 12 foot broad; It is not above a Mile round: On the East-side, on the top of an high Hill stands a strong Citadel, very well Fortified, built at first by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> having 40 or 50 Pieces of Ord∣nance, and Garrisoned by 300 Renegadoes. Ano∣ther Castle somewhat less on the West overlooks the Town; There is a very commodious <HI>Mold</HI> in the Har∣bor
<PB N="24" REF="15"/>
able to contain above 200 ships; upon which stands a strong Fort threatning destruction to all As∣saillants Three Tyer of Guns being planted in it, the lowest is level with the water; The <HI>Mold</HI> is so crooked that no ships can come in with full sail without turn∣ing; so that it is very difficult to break the Chain, and enter by force; This Nest of Pyrates are very well prepared against the attempts of an enemy, none can hardly do them any injury either by Land or Sea, so that they retreat hither like wild Beasts to their Dens, to enjoy their Thefts and Prey; The Town is built on a Rock hard to be undermined. The Em∣peror <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. attempted to drive them out of their nests, but in vain, though he came with a Navy by Sea, and a puissant Army by Land to be∣siege the Town; The violence of a Storm broke his vessels to pieces, and forced him to raise the siege, with the loss of an 100 ships, and many Thousand men; since which <HI>Argiers</HI> is much stronger and bet∣ter Fortified daily, so that unless the <HI>European</HI> Princes join together, or some powerful Monarch lay siege to it by Sea and Land, it will be one day Impreg∣nable unless by Famine. The Houses of the City are very pleasant, and more beautiful within and without than in other parts of <HI>Africa;</HI> the greater lye open in the middle with handsome Gal∣leries and Turrets; several Mosquets are built for Publick Devotion, into which no Christian must en∣ter unless he turn <HI>Turk,</HI> or else he will be burnt, or for handling the book of their Law before witness, or repeating their Prayer, <HI>Illa Alla Mahumet, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Others have a great Number of their <HI>Talubs,</HI> or Religious men to read Publick Prayers, and others to expound the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law; Over all is placed a <HI>Marabut,</HI> who is to Judge matters of Equity between Persons; Besides the King, and Bashaw, the <HI>Lagaw,</HI> is the next chief man in this City, who is the first Person of the <HI>Divan</HI> or Council, and General of the Armies abroad, under whom are the <HI>Chenses</HI> like our
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>
Sheriffs or Justices of Peace; next are the <HI>Boulge∣bushes,</HI> like our Bailiffs, who are Servants to the <HI>Divan,</HI> and remain 3 years in their places, going out after with the Armies as Comptrollers of the rest. There are also other <HI>Bushes,</HI> Captains and Officers of the <HI>Militia,</HI> who wear a badg of Honour on their heads, and are distin∣guished from the rest by their Turbant, which is wound about in the form of a Sugar-loaf, behind which a Redcross falls down, and is a badg of their Office, which others must not wear, as the Red-scarf is a sign of Command among Christians; In the Camp are other Great Officers as <HI>Daventees, Mouchees, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Achabasha</HI> is an experienced man among them, who hath been in several Encounters, and commands a Party when it is separated from the main Body; He must be an old Man, and when he once comes to that Employment he can rise no higher as other Officers can. There are most pleasant Gardens and Orchards about <HI>Argiers,</HI> and very good Corn upon the Hills near it, with plenty of all things but wine, which is forbidden to the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> yet those of <HI>Ar∣giers,</HI> have not such scrupulous Consciences, but that they will be drunk with wine when they take good store of Prizes. Toward the East of the City is a very strong House built, and some souldiers to keep Guard, it being the Publick Treasury House wherein they every year cast in vast sums of Money accord∣ing to their success against the Christians, which they never take out, so that its thought there are many Millions in that Hold; When the ships come in, there is alwayes something for the Treasury, and a good Portion for <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and those that read Pray∣ers, which is put into the hands of a Treasurer, whom if they find to have converted the least part thereof to his private use, he is cruelly put to death in this manner; He is stript naked, and at the door of the <HI>Marabut,</HI> he is impaled alive, that is a stake is thrust into his Fundament and driven leasurely up through his body; In this manner he is raised to the top of
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>
the steeple of a <HI>Mosquet</HI> or <HI>Church,</HI> where he is ex∣posed to Publick view for three dayes, and then his body is carried out of the City to be given for food to the wild beasts, and his Estate sold for the benefit of the Religious men; There are excellent Orders to stir them up to their Worship, they are often called to Prayers that is in the Morning, at twelve a Clock, at four afternoon, at Sunsetting, at Twilight, and at Midnight, at all which times great numbers of all sorts re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort to their Mosquetts, and there in an humble man∣ner on their Faces pray to God and <HI>Mahomet;</HI> Those that are negligent in coming to Prayers, are taken notice of, and if formerly Christians are excluded from all hopes of Imployment, and for the least of∣fence severely Treated; The Ceremonies used at Consecrating their Priests are observable; The Fa∣ther of the young man brings him before the <HI>Marabut,</HI> or Cheif Preist, who sits in the Principal Mosquette of the City with a numerous attendance to be Witnesses of his Dedication to that Service, entring the place the Father holding his son on the right hand, they both approach the <HI>Marabut</HI> and kiss the Hem of his Garment, who ask's the Father whether he can read; He answers yes, and a book is immediately brought usually the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> who reads a page in it; If he miss not a word but read it distinctly, he is then ad∣mitted; and his name inrolled in the Order; Then a Fellow with a sharp Knife cuts in his right Arm the Figure of an half Moon, into the wound is put Gun-powder, which being blown up, leaves a blue Im∣pression that nothing can take away unless the place be cut off, After some Prayers for Confirmation, he is obliged to swear by <HI>Mahomets</HI> Lock to observe cer∣tain Rules; He is then clothed in another manner before the People, and the <HI>Marabut</HI> takes him into his Armes, and gives him a Kiss, which sanctifies him for ever; The Solemnity ends in Musick and Danc∣ing; Their Marriages, Circumcisions, and other Customs are not much different from the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="16"/>Many other particulars I observed during the Hap∣py time of my Slavery, having liberty to walk up and down my business and work being only to wait up∣on my Lady at the time of her Devotions; But after two years she departed this Life, leaving me suffici∣ent cause to Lament; Another of the Kings Wives was supposed to have poysoned her, because he had a greater love for her by reason of her constant De∣votions than for the other; About six months before her Death, she was brought to bed of a Girl some∣what whiter than ordinary, which the old Fool thought himself to be the Father of; During her sickness she sent to her Cosens house, where I lay, to speak with him, whom she ingaged to release me af∣ter her Burial in requital of my good Service, and sent me by her Gentlewoman a considerable present in Gold which I did not possess long; After her death her Cosen did not perform her request, but led me to the Market, where I was sold for 300 Dollars, I durst not anger him for fear he should publish the <HI>Mystery</HI> which would infallibly cost me my head; My next Master was a Gardiner, who put me into his Orchards, and there with a good Cudgel made me understand a new Trade I never knew before, I endured much with him, for he made me labour above my strength, and often threatned to stab and kill me, therefore fear of Death made me endeavour my escape; I was sometimes sent for Lime, for a building he had in hand near the Seashore; A Vessel was lately arrived from <HI>France</HI> to redeem the Captives, and lay without the Mold, at what time I was on the shore it was dusky, a <HI>Frenchman</HI> offered me his assistance, I accepted of it and went into his Boat, but was discovered before I could get off the <HI>Mold</HI> and sent back to my Master, who punished me with an 100 blows on the soles of my Feet, whereby I became unserviceable many days; He was soon weary of my Company; and sold me to the <HI>English Renegado</HI> aforesaid, I expected from him a kinder

entertainment but found worse, he was cruel &amp; severe to me, making me work night and day; I often treated for my ransom, but his demands were so high, that I could not comply with him; He abused we wretchedly about five Months, and then death put an end to his Tyranny; His Executors sold me again among his Goods and Chattels; I fell next into the hands of an <HI>Italian</HI> Renegado, who was no kinder to me than my former Masters, my work was painful, my Diet mean, my Labour continual, and my Re∣wards the blows of a hard Cudgel; I could not long endure this Service, and therefore sought to displease my Patron, and make him sell me to another; He gave me next to an Officer of the <HI>Militia,</HI> who was so well pleased with my Person and Countenance that he resolved not to part with me for any Money I offered him 800 Dollars, he told me, <HI>I should first go with him into the Countrey, and at his return I should have Liberty to be redeemed if I behaved my self well;</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> about this time sent a strong Army to gather the Contributions, of the People, and to relieve <HI>Tremisen</HI> or <HI>Climsan,</HI> a strong Populous City in the In∣land parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> which commands all the rest of Countrey, and was now besieged by the <HI>Arabs</HI> their deadly Enemies;</P>
<P>Having run through so many strange and unex∣pected Fortunes and Adventures, I doubted not but to meet with as much variety in this Expedition, my Master was Commander of an 100 men, he was very passionate and Lascivious, but withal valiant; Our Army was composed of a thousand Horse, and two thousand Foot, besides Slaves and Servants; with which strong Party we set forward, and found the Countrey very fruitful of Corn and Fodder; As we past by a Wood, we had the sight of several wild Beasts that returned from seeking their Prey; Our Vanguard shot at many of them, one of our Com∣pany to shew his Valour, met a Lyon that advanced toward us, and with his Scymiter in his hand en∣countred
<PB N="29" REF="17"/>
him, but the sport almost cost the Fellow his Life, for the Lyon was very strong, and struck him down twice with his Paws, and the last time in a rage bit off part of his Arm, and would have instant∣ly devoured him, had we not all shot at him and fixed above an hundred Bullets in his Body; We found the Fellow almost dead with fear under the Lion; He was glad with the loss of some of his Flesh to have so happily escaped, none pitying him since his rashness deserved it. In three Leagues we came to a little Valley fruitful of Palms and Olivetrees, with a small Rivulet covered with Strawberry Bushes, and a Grove at the end; Wherein I saw a flying Ser∣pent about the bigness of an ordinary Dog, with a large mouth and Tongue about four foot long, we shot at it but could not kill it; It threatned some of our men, who ventured to go near it, and would not go till a great number came toward it; I saw it near a pleasant Fountain, but could not learn the name; It had Wings of divers colours, especially Red and White, bigger than those of our winged Fowls, but I could not discern the substance of them; It hover∣ed long over our heads, and had not the noise of our Guns frighted it away, I think it had ventured among us again, all the Birds that saw it at a distance fled away. I imagined it to be a kind of Basilisk; a de∣sperate Serpent, and extraordinary venemous, it was admired by all of us having never seen the like, which made me believe it some Inland Creature not usually seen near the Sea-Coasts.</P>
<P>Our business in this Journey was to gather Contri∣bution of the Inhabitants, who do not willingly pay, and therefore the <HI>Turks</HI> are forced to go in great numbers to oblige them to it; The third day we passed over high Mountains fenced on all sides with craggy Rocks, so that we were forced to climb over them. Our Horse took a Compass about by a way more easie; About noon the Sun was extraordinary hot which caused us to seek a repose under the shady

Trees that grew in this stony ground, as I was rest∣ing my self between sleep and waking, a great vene∣mous Scorpion fixed her sting in my naked Leg, so gently that I had not felt it, had I not been told thereof. I had heard much of this Serpent, and be∣ing stung began to fear the increase of the Venom, but some had already killed it, and brought the bloud to me to apply to the Wound, which wonder∣fully gave present Cure, for it had no sooner touched the Tumor but it began to decrease, and out of the little wound came forth a Liquor white as Milk, by which I found the bloud of the Scorpion hath an at∣tractive Virtue; I had no sooner escaped this Adven∣ture but I fell into a worse, My Master had sent me to the Rear of the Army to buy Victuals for himself it being there sold ready drest; As I was re∣turning loaded, I fell down a steep Rock with my Burden, but for fear my Master should Cudgel me, I soon recovered my self. From this unhappy place we removed up a Hill into a Countrey uninhabited, but by Monsters and wild Beasts, where∣of we saw a great many; This Mountain is part of the <HI>Atlas</HI> and runs through all this Kingdom and <HI>Fez</HI> as far as the Main Ocean, part thereof being in the se∣cond Region of the Air, and so cold that in some Corners which are not exposed to the Sun, there was a great deal of Ice and Snow; Here we found plenty of Woods and Trees, and several sorts of Birds, we killed one that had 4 Legs like a Beast; Its body was as big as a Turky-cock, and the head like an Owl, its Tail was extream broad, the Fea∣thers Gray, and the head black, it flies slowly, and was therefore killed without difficulty.</P>
<P>Toward Evening we saw several sorts of Lyons go out of their Dens, when the Jackals began to bark, the Noblest is called the <HI>Royal</HI> Lyon, of shape bigger and stronger, and a more couragious Voice; when any of the rest meet such a one, they seem to yeild a respect to him, He is graver in his motion, fiercer

in the Encounter, and undaunted in the greatest danger, others are smaller; every night we were visited with several Companies of wild Creatures, some of whom had the boldness to break in upon us, but never returned back to tell news. One Evening we discovered a great Beast afar off, and some of us went nearer to discharge our Guns at it; It was a Monster of a large size, the head like a Lion, the Paws like a Bear, the hinder parts much like an Ass. When it was killed every one in the Army had a sight thereof, and I then remembred the saying of the <HI>Romans, Africa alwayes produces something new,</HI> for there is every year some strange Creature or other to be seen in those remote places; some make it their business to watch them when they come into the World, and imploy all their Art to catch them, and shew them for money; In this wild place were seve∣ral other sorts of Beasts and Serpents, one of a strange nature seeming like a white Lamb, which fled before us; Our Captain thought it to be so, and that it had straggled, and therefore we had order to persue it, and coming near, it made more hast than ordinary to shift among the Trees, but being very weary and over-fat, it could not escape us, yet ran into one of the Bushes, where to prevent discovery its white colour was changed in an instant into that of the Bush, which alteration gave us much trouble, and we had never found it again if one of the Com∣pany had not discharged a Musket, at the noise where∣of it rose affrighted, and run for its life, we did not think it the same, yet some ventured after it, and o∣thers stay'd in the place seeking the white beast. The Persuers shot off one of its Legs, and then cri∣ed to us to forbear seeking, and that the Counterfeit Lamb was caught. It was the same shaped Beast, but the colour was no more white as before, but chang∣ed into a blackish Gray; Its Coat was a Fine Wool the head like a Wolf, but not quite so long, with very sharp Teeth, and a fierce look, the hinder
<PB N="32" REF="19"/>
parts like a sheep, we wondred at this change of co∣lour, and imagined it to be that Beast mentioned by by the Learned, and is a good Emblem of a Hypo∣crite.</P>
<P>Having in three days got over these Mountains and lying down to refresh our selves, in the Morning an Alarum was sounded, at which we all ran to our Arms, and put our selves in Order, expecting the coming of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> but no Enemy appeared, only a Company of Apes persued by a few Jackalls who made such a noise in running about the branches of the Wood near us, yet those upon the skirts of the Army thought them to be the Enemy, who had ta∣ken the advantage of the place to fall upon us; their needless fear did as soon appear as the nimble Creatures recovered the tops of the highest Trees, to whose protection they durst commit themselves; yet the Alarum continued, and ran as nimbly as the Apes all over the Army, which could not be stopt till every one was informed of the true cause of the Fright.</P>
<P>Soon after we met with the Enemy indeed, and had several Skirmishes with them, and at last utterly defeated them, and brought the whole Countrey under Contribution, and at last arrived at <HI>Chinsan</HI> a large and populous City, where we continued for some time, and then travelled toward another anci∣ent City called <HI>Bedtua,</HI> not much inferior to the for∣mer, we passed through many Companies of Tents, and the first day had a sharp Encounter with about a Dozen lusty Lions who hunting after their Prey, met with death at the end of our Muskets, yet were they not killed without some damage, one of our men was wounded with one of their Paws, who lept upon him after he had been struck through the Belly, which made us soon dispatch the Lyon. This dan∣ger was followed by another more fearful though we again happily escaped; For the next day we passed through a Sandy plain about ten Leagues long, and

four broad; in which were raised several little Hills moveable with the Wind, between which we were of necessity to pass; as soon as we were entred, a strong Easterly Wind raises the light Sand, and threatens to bury us alive. It was a fearful thing to us to be∣hold so much earth flying in our Faces, and the Air thick with the dusty Sand; in a Moment a Hill was removed from one place to another, and we were forced besides to encounter with the boisterous Wind, whereby our Horses were half buried in an instant, neither durst we make a stop here in this dreadful place for fear of being past hopes of return∣ing. In eight dayes we had a sight of <HI>Bedtua,</HI> where we continued for some time, and then returned back to <HI>Chinsan,</HI> where we staid much longer, in which time I took notice of many particulars, and of the several ways of Execution; as Impaling by thrusting a sharp stake into the body of the Criminal which enters in between his Legs, and appears again at his mouth, in which manner they usually treat Traytors and Robbers; in this cruel manner some will live six hours; Those that commit Adultery, or Murder, are cast down headlong from the top of a of a high precipice at the bottom whereof sharp stakes are erected; For those that have committed Sacriledge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they pour scalding Lead into his Mouth, which sinks in with with an horrible smoak, and burns the Throat to the entrails without the least Shreik; Others are exposed to the Cruelty of the Children, who with sharp Sticks and Lances prick them to death, thereby accustoming these young Spirits to Bloud and Wounds. There is also another as strange an Execution as the former; In the great Market-place of the City stands a Brazen Lyon, hollow within, with a grim and threatning Countenance, at his side a door opens to receive those that are to be executed, which Execu∣tion is performed in this manner; some very great Offenders who have been useless in their lives
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>
are forced to make some sport to the World at their Deaths: For they are shut into this new Invention, and a Fire of wood is kindled under it, which by degrees as it heats the brass, puts them to a greater Torture, and the pain forces them to complain and cry out. Now at the Mouth, Ears, and under the Tail of the Lion are holes Artificially made, out of which the Complaints and Cryes of the Patient do burst forth through different Windings and Turnings in such a manner that several Voices, or rather Tunes are framed one after another; for the cry is longer coming out of the Tail than the Ears, and so of the Mouth; besides the variety of the cries yeilds a pleasant and a various sound to the ears of the Spectators. This cruel sport continues many times a whole day to divert the People; for at the Judges Pleasure they kindle a greater or lesser Fire, which causes the Prisoner to dye accordingly: During my three years abode there, I saw above twenty cast into that Oven; A Woman, a Child, and a Man were put in together, for it is very large; Their Crime was, that they had attempted to kill our Governour by the Solicitation of a <HI>Morisco</HI> Prince who hated him, the Woman was to Trepan and en∣snare him with her Beauty, and to convey some Poi∣son secretly by that means into his Drink, and if that failed, the man was to stab or shoot him. The Woman having large and beautiful Eyes, our old General was soon acquainted with her, but as they were together, he discovered a Box which she was so desirous to hide from him, that he suspected it to be Poyson, but to be more assured he tryed it upon a Dog, who died within an hour after. The Woman confessed the whole design, whereupon she, her Husband, and an innocent Boy were condemned to∣gether, the Child only because he had such wicked Parents, was forced to accompany them in death; Their different Voies, and cries did yield a most pleasant, though a cruel Harmony, which was not
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>
ungrateful to the <HI>Turks</HI> who never pity the <HI>Moors.</HI> They use in this City strangling (as well as the <HI>Turks</HI>) drowning with a stone about their neck, executing by Beasts, by the Sword and other deaths used in other places, Besides one other manner of execut∣ing Offenders, proper to this place which was as cruel as strange to us. Out of the Town is planted a high Post in form of a Cross, upon which the Of∣fender is laid, stript naked, and his Tongue cut out, then they stretch him on the Post that lyes a-cross, and tye him to it both by his hands and feet; thus they expose him to the fury of the Ravenous Birds, who soon smell him out, the Eagles and Vultures dispatch him in less than a day, the poor Creature lies at their mercy, he sees them fix their sharp Bills in his Flesh, and pluck out his heart not being able to resist them, and it cannot but torment him to see himself become a Prey to the Birds of the Air, and to behold such base Creatures insult over him, and feed themselves on his Flesh without the least respect to his humanity. It is observed that the Eagles first seek for the Heart, and tear up the breast to find it, without regard to the rest of the body till that be devoured, sometimes twenty of these Birds are seen at once upon a poor man, this part of the World being full of them; A sight that would move com∣passion in any Breast but that of a <HI>Turk,</HI> and had I not feared the censure of the Law, which makes it death to hinder the execution of the Sentence, I had once ventured to protect the body of one poor man from those ravenous Birds.</P>
<P>After we had taken all the Country which was re∣volted, we returned to the Maritime City of <HI>Argiers,</HI> My Master was grown very rich, and powerful, and had got great honour, and great wealth for his Services.

Exigency, according to his promise often made me, he gave me my Liberty, and a sum of Money to car∣ry me home; so that after so many strange Adven∣tures and Discoveries which I had made in this my long time of Slavery, I met with a <HI>French</HI> Vessel of <HI>Marseilles</HI> in the Harbour, wherein I embarqued for my Native Countrey. <HI>Adventures T. S.</HI> 1670.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Adventures, Dangers and Troubles of <HI>Katherine</HI> Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Suffolk</HI> are very re∣markable, as we find them recorded in the Book of Martyrs. This Dutchess was the Widow of <HI>Charles Brandon</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and after his death was married to <HI>Richard Berty</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>. In the first year of Queen <HI>Mary, Stephen Gardiner</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI> knowing this Dutchess to be a zealous Protestant, and no good Friend of his, resolved to be revenged of her husband first, and <HI>subpoena'd</HI> him before him, al∣ledging, <HI>That it was the Queens pleasure he should pre∣sently pay</HI> 4000 <HI>pound due to her Father from D.</HI> Charles <HI>late husband to his Dutchess,</HI> whose Executrix she was. Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> replyed, <HI>That Debt was already truly satisfied.</HI> The Bishop answered, <HI>The Queen would not be put off with payments in the time of</HI> Kets <HI>Government,</HI> (so he in scorn called King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth's Reign;) Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> said, <HI>It was acknowledged to be paid by K.</HI> Henry <HI>the Eighth. If that be true,</HI> said the Bishop; <HI>I will shew you favour, but Mr.</HI> Berty, says he, <HI>I must tell you another thing because I intend you well; I hear ill of your Religion, and pray is your Lady now as forward to set up Mass as she was to pull it down, when she caused a Dog in a Rochet to be carried with her, which she called by my name, or doth she now think her Lambs as safe, as when she saw me vail my Bonnet to her out of the Tower window, at which time she said,</HI> <Q>That it was merry with the Lambs when the Wolves were shut up.</Q> <HI>And at another time when my Lord her husband invited me amongst other Lords to Dinner, desiring every Lady to chuse him whom she liked best, and so place themselves together, your Lady taking me by the hand said,</HI> <Q>That since she might
<PB N="37" REF="21"/>
not sit by her husband whom she loved best, she had chosen me whom she loved worst.</Q> To which Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> replyed; <HI>My Lord, Of the device of the Dog, she was neither the Author nor Allower. As for her words she can answer her self, and for the Mass she hath been taught by learned men to abhorre it, and therefore if she should outwardly pretend to it, she would be a false Chri∣stian to Christ, and a masquing Subject to her Prince, you know my Lord, one Judgment reformed is better than a Thousand Transformed Time-servers. Yea marry,</HI> says the Bishop, <HI>deliberation is good, if she were to come from an old Religion to a New, but she is to return from a new one to an old one; when I was her Ghostly Father she was as earnest a Papist as any My Lord,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Berty, she told a Friend lately,</HI> <Q>That Religion went not by Age, but by Truth, and therefore she was to be converted by Argument and not by Compulsion.</Q> <HI>Pray do you think it possible,</HI> says the Bishop, <HI>to perswade her? I hope,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Berty, you will find no fruits of Infidelity in her.</HI> The Bishop then perswaded Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> to take pains in her Conversion, promising him large Fa∣vours to effect it, and so dismist him.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> came home he had frequent inti∣mations from his Friends, That the Bishop intended to call his Dutchess to an Account for her Faith, and therefore they designed to go beyond Sea. In pur∣suance whereof Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> made such Friends to the Queen, as to obtain her License to pass and repass at pleasure, to receive several summes of money due to Duke <HI>Charles</HI> from the Emperor of <HI>Germany;</HI> Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> went beyond Sea accordingly, but without his Dutchess who yet by agreement was to follow, and made her escape from this desperate danger in the manner following.</P>
<P>She dwelt at that time in <HI>Barbiean,</HI> and acquainted none of her Servants with her design but only one old Gentleman, neither did she take any but the meanest of her Servants with her, fearing the o∣thers would not run so dangerous an adventure, she
<PB N="38" REF="22"/>
took also her young Daughter of a year old with her. Upon New-years-day, about four a Clock in the Morning she went from her own house, and an He∣rald of the Queens who lay in her house to guard her hearing the noise, rose up, and came down with a lighted Torch in his hand, so that for fear of disco∣very she was forc't to leave most of her Childs ne∣cessaries behind, and ordered her Servants to make hast to <HI>Lyon Key,</HI> taking with her only two Women and her Child; she was no sooner out of doors but the Herald followed, whereupon she stepped into the <HI>Charterhouse</HI> Gate, so that he could not see her, the Herald finding some things she had lost, fell to ran∣sacking them, and in the mean time she hasted away knowing the place only by name, where she should take boat. Her Servants also divided themselves, and only one of them knew the way thither; Thus she attired in a mean habit, and they that were with her, took their way into <HI>Finsbury</HI> Fields, where by the special Providence of Heaven, near <HI>Moregate</HI> she and all her Company met, and went together to <HI>Lyon-Key,</HI> a Barge was there ready for her; but the morning was so extream misty that the Steersman would not venture out without great intreaty. Soon after the Council were informed of her departure, whereup∣on some came presently to her house to inquire out the manner of her escape, and to take an Inventory of her Goods, and Orders were issued to apprehend her, so that the noise of her Flight, was at <HI>Leigh</HI> in <HI>Essex</HI> before her Arrival.</P>
<P>When she came thither, the old Gentleman her Servant carried her privately to a Merchants house near <HI>Leigh,</HI> naming her Mistriss <HI>White,</HI> where she stay∣ed till she had made some new Provision for her Child in the room of that left behind her at <HI>Barbican.</HI> When the time came she was to take Shipping, she hardly escaped Discovery, and being 'twice carried into the Seas almost within sight of <HI>Zealand,</HI> by con∣trary Winds was driven back to the place whence

she came; And at her last return the searchers sus∣pecting she might be in that Ship, examined her Servant that came to buy Victuals, who told them such an innocent Story of a Merchants Wife which was on Shipboard, that they searcht no further; and so at last the safely arrived in <HI>Brabant,</HI> where she met with her Husband, who apparelling her and her Women like <HI>Dutch</HI> Froes, they travelled to <HI>Santon,</HI> and had leave from the Magistrates to live privately there, but it being reported they were greater Per∣sonages than they pretended, the Bishop and Magi∣strates resolved to seize and examine them both of their Condition and Religion; but Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> having secret notice thereof, took his Dutchess, his Child, and the two Women, and about three Afternoon in <HI>February</HI> walked out as if to take the Air, intending that Night to get to <HI>Wesel,</HI> and the better to conceal his design they went on Foot, and left the rest of their Family at <HI>Santon:</HI> They had not gone above an <HI>English</HI> Mile, but there fell a mighty Rain, which dissolved the Frost and Ice; and so made the wayes deep and slippery, which proved extream tedious to these new Lacquies, and no Waggon to be gotten, so that Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> was forced to carry the Child, and the Dutchess his Cloak and Rapier, the Women be∣ing sent before. At last, near seven a Clock in the dark Evening, they came to <HI>Wesel,</HI> seeking after such a tedious Journey to repose and refresh their wea∣ried Limbs in an Inn, but they all refused to enter∣tain them, though they offered a considerable sum for the same, judging them to be ill People.</P>
<P>In the mean time the poor Babe cried bitterly, the Dutchess wept as fast, the Weather was extream Cold, and the Heavens rained as fast as the Clouds could pour. Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> destitute of all Worldly Suc∣cour and relief for him and his, in this deplorable Condition, resolved to carry the Dutchess with her Infant into the Porch of the great Church, and so to buy some Coals, Food and Straw for their Repose

that night, or at least till he could procure some better Lodging; Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> could speak little <HI>Dutch,</HI> and could meet with none who understood either <HI>English, French, Italian,</HI> or <HI>Latin,</HI> till going toward the Church he heard two Boys speaking in <HI>Latin,</HI> who stepping to them, promised them two Stivers if they would bring him to a <HI>Walloons</HI> house, and so it pleased God he happened into a house where Mounsieur <HI>Rivers</HI> a Minister was at Supper, he had formerly been in <HI>England,</HI> and received some Courtesies from this good Dutchess; Mounsieur <HI>Rivers</HI> going to the door, and seeing Mr. <HI>Berty,</HI> his Dutchess and Infant in that lamentable Case with Rain, Mire and Dirt, and in Apparel so unlike what he had seen them in <HI>England,</HI> was so overwhelmed with sorrow, and tears, that for some time he could neither speak to them, nor they to him: At last they saluted each other, and he brought them to his house, into which God knows they entred joyfully, Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> changing his Clothes with the good Man of the House, the Dutchess with his Wife, and their In∣fant with the Child of the House. Here they con∣tinued some time, and then hired a House, where they discovered themselves freely, and lived in good fashion, but whilst they past the time here with some content, in hope of resting after their Tedious Tra∣vels, Sir <HI>John Mason,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Ambassador in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> gave them private notice of a design for seizing and carrying them back to <HI>England,</HI> managed by the L. <HI>Paget.</HI> For the D. of <HI>Brunswick</HI> being to pass by that City with ten Companies of Souldiers to assist the Emperour against the <HI>French,</HI> it was con∣trived that he should suddenly apprehend them, and carry them away from <HI>Wesel.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Information Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> with his Dutchess, &amp; Child, presently fly into the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and found Pro∣tection in <HI>Wincheim,</HI> but the money which they brought out of <HI>England</HI> being almost spent, they began to faint under their heavy burden, being almost out of
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>
heart and hope in this their distressed condition, at which time it pleased God to provide wonderfully for them by the following means. One <HI>John a Lasco,</HI> being driven out of <HI>England</HI> at Queen <HI>Maries</HI> com∣ing to the Crown, after many troubles and adventures returned into <HI>Poland</HI> his Native Countrey, where he found great favour with that King, and understand∣ing the Condition of Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> and his Dutchess whom he had known in <HI>England,</HI> he gave an account thereof to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Vilna,</HI> who presently wrote to them to come thither with great offers of kindness. They returned Letters full of Thanks to the King, and <HI>Palatine,</HI> and sent with them all the remainder of the Jewels which they had brought from <HI>England;</HI> and having received Letters of Conduct for their Security, in <HI>April</HI> 1557 the Dutchess with her Husband and Family began their Journey toward <HI>Poland.</HI> By the way they met with many dangers; One was occasioned by a Cap∣tain of the Lantgraves who quarrelled with Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> about a Spaniel of his, and with his Horsemen set upon them by the way, thrusting their Boar-spears through the sides of the Waggon where the Children and Women were, yet it pleased God none of them were hurt; Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> had only four Horsemen with him, and in the quarrel the Captains Horse was slain under him, upon which a Rumor was presently spread about the Countrey, that the <HI>Lantgraves</HI> Cap∣tain was slain by the <HI>Walloons,</HI> which much enraged the Common people against them. The Dutchess understanding their danger, perswaded her husband to leave them, and by the swiftness of his horse to recover some Town for his Security; which Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> attempting to do, was eagerly pursued by the Coun∣trymen, and the Captains Brother, who thought he had been slain indeed. And in the pursuit they came so near him that he had certainly been mur∣thered, but that as God would have it, spying a Ladder standing against a Window, he leapt off his
<PB N="42" REF="24"/>
Horse and ran up the Ladder, whereby he got into a Garret on the top of the house where he defended himself for some time with his Sword, and dagger, till the Magistrates came and perswaded him to submit to the Law; Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> knowing himself to be clear and the Captain alive, yielded himself upon condi∣tion to be protected from the rude multitude, and delivering up his weapons was committed to Custody till the Case should be heard; Mr. <HI>Berty</HI> then writ to the <HI>Lantgrave</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Erbagh,</HI> declaring his Case to them, and the next morning the Earl came to Town, where the Dutchess was now arriv∣ed in the Waggon; The Earl having before heard of the Dutchess, came to see her, shewing much civility, and respect toward her; which the Towns∣men observing, and finding the Captain was alive, they began to shrink away and make Friends to Mr. <HI>Berty,</HI> and the Dutchess not to represent their Acti∣ons at the worst.</P>
<P>And thus through Divine Providence escaping this great danger also, they proceeded in their Jour∣ney, and at last arrived safely in <HI>Poland,</HI> where they were entertained by the King with all humanity and kindness; The King likewise settling them safely and Honourably in the Earldom of <HI>Crozan,</HI> where they had as absolute a Power in Government as the King himself, so that it proved to them a quiet Ha∣ven, after so many Troubles in a Tempestuous Sea, and there they lived with much Honour and Com∣fort till the Death of bloudy Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> and then re∣turned together with the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion into their native Countrey in the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of Glorious Memory. <HI>Clarks Martyr.</HI> 521.</P>

was had in great esteem, a great Divine, and an excellent Preacher, of a grave behaviour, sincere and inclining to no Faction; and which increased his Reputation, he lived honestly, without Ostenta∣tion or desire of outward Glory; Many tossings and troubles he indured in his life-time; For in his younger years having passed his course in Philoso∣phy in the University of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> he went from thence into <HI>England,</HI> and waited on the Lord <HI>Dacres</HI> Children as a Tutor for two years; But Wars then happening between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> he return∣ed home and became a Fryer of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Or∣der; He had not lived long among them, when up∣on suspicion of Heresie he was put into Prison, after his Release he went back to <HI>England,</HI> hoping by means of the L. <HI>Dacres</HI> to have got a place in <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> but his expectation being frustrated, he went into <HI>France</HI> and from thence to <HI>Rome.</HI> There he won such favour with Cardinal <HI>Pool</HI> that by his re∣commendation he was received among the <HI>Dominicans</HI> of <HI>Bononia,</HI> and by them was first appointed to in∣struct the Novices of the Cloyster; Afterwards when they perceived his diligence and dexterity in busi∣nesse, he was employed in their Affairs throughout <HI>Italy,</HI> and was sent in Commission to <HI>Chios</HI> an Island in the <HI>Ionick</HI> Sea, to redress things that were amiss among those of their Order.</P>
<P>Herein he discharged himself so well, that at his return he was made Rector of the School, and there∣by had access to the Libraries, especially to that of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> where meeting with <HI>Calvins Instituti∣ons,</HI> he was taken with a great liking thereof; and one day discoursing with a Reverend Old Man of the Monastery, he was by him confirmed in the opinion he had entertained; but withall was warned by no means to discover himself, or to make his mind known, because the times were dangerous. But he neglecting the Counsel of the old Man, and disclo∣sing his Opinions too freely, was accused of Heresie,
<PB N="44" REF="25"/>
and being sent to <HI>Rome,</HI> after Examination he was Imprisoned for Nine Moneths, at the end whereof being brought before the Judge of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> and making a clear Confession of his Faith, he was condemned to be burnt the next day, being the 29 of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>It happened that the same night Pope <HI>Paul</HI> 4 died; upon the noise of whose death, the People came in a Tumult to the place where his Statue in Marble was erected, and pulling it down, did for the space of three dayes drag it through the Streets, and in the end threw it into the River of <HI>Tiber;</HI> During this Tumult all the Prisons were broke open, and the Prisoners set free, and among others Mr. <HI>Craig</HI> had his Liberty; And as he endeavoured to escape, as not thinking it safe to continue in the City, two things happened to him not unworthy relating; First in the Suburbs as he passed along he met a sort of Outlawed People, whom they call <HI>Banditi;</HI> One of the Company taking him aside de∣manded if he had ever been at <HI>Bononia,</HI> He answered, <HI>That he had been sometime there; Do you not remember,</HI> said he, <HI>that walking on a time in the Feilds with some young Noblemen, there came a poor maimed Souldier to you intreating some releis.</HI> Mr. <HI>Craig</HI> said, <HI>He did not well remember it; But I do,</HI> said he, <HI>and I am the man to whom you then shewed kindness, be not afraid of us, for you shall incur no danger,</HI> and so conveying him through the Suburbs and directing him the securest way, he gave him so much money as might bear his Charges to <HI>Bononia;</HI> for he intended to go thither, thinking to find entertainment among his acquain∣tance there; but at his coming to them, they looked strangely upon him, whereupon being afraid to be betrayed by them, he got secretly away in∣tending his Course for <HI>Millain;</HI> By the way another Accident befell him, which he afterwards often re∣lated to many Persons of Quality as a singular Testi∣mony of Gods Providence, and care over him, and
<PB N="45" REF="25"/>
thus it was; when he had travelled some days, go∣ing out of the High-ways for fear of Discovery, he came into a wild and desart Forrest, and being sore∣ly tired, he lay down among some Bushes on the side of a little Brook to refresh himself, lying there Pensive, and full of thoughts, not knowing where he was, nor having money to bear his Charges, a Dog with a Purse in his Teeth, came fawning upon him, and laid it down before him; He being struck with fear rose up, and judging it to proceed from God's favourable Providence toward him, he fol∣lowed his way, till he came to a little Village where he met with some who were travelling to <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> whereupon changing his former intentions he went in their Company to that City.</P>
<P>Whilst he continued there, professing himself one of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Order, he was brought to preach before <HI>Maximilian</HI> 2.

<P>Let us now see the deserved punishment of this Notorious bloudy Wretch; This <HI>Francis Ravillac</HI> was born in <HI>Angoulesme,</HI> by Profession a Lawyer, who after the committing of that Horrid Fact being siezed and put upon the Rack, <HI>May</HI> 25. the 27 he had Sen∣tence of Death passed on him; and was executed accordingly in the manner following; He was brought out of Prison in his Shirt with a Torch of two pound weight lighted in one hand, and the Knife, wherewith he Murdered the King, chained to the other, he was then set upright in a Dung-cart, wherein he was carried to the <HI>Greve</HI> or place of Execution, where a strong Scaffold was built; At his coming upon the Scaffold he cros∣sed himself, a sign that he died a <HI>Papist,</HI> then he was bound to an Engine of wood made like St. <HI>An∣drew</HI>'s Cross, which done, his hand with the Knife chained to it was put into a Furnace then flam∣ing with Fire and Brimstone, wherein it was in a most Terrible manner consumed, at which he cast forth horrible cryes like one tormented in Hell, yet would he not confess any thing; After which the Executioner having made Pincers Red hot in the same Furnace, they did pinch his Paps, the brawns of his Arms and Thighs, the Calves of his Legs, with other fleshy parts of his Body, pulling out Collops of Flesh, and burning them before his
<PB N="48" REF="27"/>
Face, then they poured into those wounds scalding Oyl, Rosin, Pitch and Brimstone melted together, after which they set a hard Roundel of Clay upon his Navel, having a hole in the middle, into which they poured melted Lead; at which he again roared out most horribly, yet confessed nothing; But to make the last act of his Tragedy equal in Torments to the rest, they caused four strong Horses to be brought to tear his body in pieces, where being ready to suffer his last Torment he was again questioned but would not reveal any thing, and so died without calling upon God, or speaking one word concerning Heaven; His Flesh and Joints were so strongly knit together that those four Horses could not in a long time dismember him, but one of them fainting a Gentleman who was present, mounted upon a mighty strong Horse, alighted, and tied him to one of the Wretches Limbs, yet for all this they were constrained to cut the flesh under his Armes and Thighs with a sharp Razor, whereby his body was the easier torn in pieces; which done the Fury of the Peo∣ple was so great, that they pulled his dismem∣bred Carcass out of the Executioners hands, which they dragged up and down the dirt, and cutting off the fllesh with their Knives, the Bones which remained were brought to the place of Executi∣on and there burnt, the Ashes were cast in the Wind, being judged unworthy of Earths Burial; By the same Sentence all his Goods were forfeit to the King. It was also ordained that the House where he had been born, should be beaten down a recompence being given the owner thereof, and never any house to be built again on that ground; That within fifteen dayes after the Publication of the Sentence by sound of Trumpet in the Town of <HI>Angoulesme,</HI> his Father and Mother should depart the Realm never to return again, if they did to

<P N="15">XV. <HI>Dionysius</HI> the younger, King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> had his Kingdom in good constitution, and sufficiently fortified; having no less then 400 Ships of five or six Oars in a Seat, He had one hundred Thousand Foot, and Nine Thousand Horse; His City of <HI>Syra∣cuse</HI> had strong Gates, and was compassed with high Walls, he had in readiness all manner of Warlike Provisions to furnish out 500 Ships more; He had Granaries wherein he laid up an 100 Myriads of that measure which contains 6 bushels of Bread Corn. He had a Magazine filled with all sorts of Arms, Offensive and Defensive; He was also fortified with Confede∣rates

and Allies, so that he himself thought the Go∣vernment was fastened to him with Chains of Ada∣mant; But being invaded by <HI>Dion</HI> in his absence, his People revolted, and behold what a fatal Revo∣lution fell out in his Family; Himself had before slain his Brothers, and in this Insurrection against him, his Sons were cruelly put to death, his Daugh∣ters were first ravished, then stript naked, and in short none of his Progeny obtained so much as a decent Burial, for some were burnt, others cut in peices, and some cast into the Sea, and he himself died old in extream Poverty, his manner being to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Barbers Shops, and as a Jester to move men to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aughter.

<P N="16">XVI. <HI>Croesus,</HI> that vast rich King of <HI>Lydia,</HI> shew∣ed the wise <HI>Solon</HI> his abundant Riches and Trea∣sures, <HI>And what thinkest thou,</HI> said he, <HI>is there any man thou knowest more happy than my self?

said he, <HI>at that time, but now I approve and admire that saying.</HI> And so did <HI>Cyrus</HI> also, for he immediately commanded <HI>Croesus</HI> to be set at Liberty, and made him one of his special Freinds.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Cyrus, Cambyses</HI> his Son reign∣ed King of <HI>Persia,</HI> and King <HI>Croesus</HI> still remained in that Court. Now it happened that King <HI>Cambyses</HI> had slain twelve <HI>Persians</HI> of Principal rank, whom K. <HI>Croesus</HI> thus admonished, <HI>Do not O King,</HI> said he, <HI>indulge thine Anger and Rage in every thing, but refrain your self; It will be for your advantage to be prudent and provident, and foresight is the part of a wise man, but you upon slight occasions put to death your Countreymen, and spare not so much as young Children, If you shall go on to do often in this manner, consider if you will not give occasion to the</HI> Persians <HI>to revolt from you; your Father</HI> Cyrus <HI>laid his strict Commands upon me that as often as occa∣sion should require I should put you in mind of those things which might conduce to your profit and welfare. Cambyses</HI> snatch up a bow and arrow with intention to have shot <HI>Croesus</HI> through therewith, but he ha∣stily fled; <HI>Cambyses</HI> thus prevented, commanded his Ministers to put him to death, but they supposing the King would repent himself, and then they should be rewarded for his safety, kept him privately alive; It was not long before <HI>Cambyses</HI> wanted the Counsel of <HI>Croesus,</HI> and when his Servants told him that he yet lived, <HI>Cambyses</HI> rejoyced thereat, but ordered them to be slain who had disobeyed his Command∣ment in preserving him whom he had condemned to Death.</P>
<P>This <HI>Cambyses</HI> was a very bloudy Tyrant which might be partly occasioned by his Flatterers, for having a mind to marry his Sister, he was told by his Lawyers, <HI>That they knew no Law which admitted such Marriages, but that there was a Law that the</HI> Persian <HI>Kings might do what they listed;</HI> which Maxim he often put in Practice; For on a time desiring to

be truly informed by <HI>Prexaspes</HI> his beloved Favorite what the <HI>Persians</HI> his Subjects thought of his Condi∣tions, He answered, <HI>They were followed with abun∣dance of praise from all men, only it was observed by many that he took more than usual delight in the Taste of Wine; Cambyses</HI> being enraged at this reproof, replied, <HI>And are the</HI> Persians <HI>double Tongued then, who also tell me that I have in all things excelled my Father</HI> Cyrus? <HI>Thou</HI> Prexaspes <HI>shalt be my witness whether in this re∣port they have done me right. For if at the first shot I pierce thy sons heart with an Arrow then it is false that hath been spoken, but if I miss the mark I am then pleased that the same be counted True and my Subjects believed;</HI> And immediately he shot an Arrow at the innocent Child, who falling down dead with the stroke, <HI>Cam∣byses</HI> commanded, the body to be opened, and his heart was found sticking upon the Arrow, at which this monstrous Tyrant greatly rejoycing shewed it to his Father with this saying instead of an Epitaph; <HI>Now,</HI> Prexaspes, <HI>thou maist resolve thy self and conclude that I have not lost my wits with wine, but the</HI> Persians <HI>there's, who report such things of me;</HI> He died misera∣bly afterward in <HI>Egypt</HI> without any Son or Successor of his Family. <HI>Rawleigh Hist.

<P N="17">XVII. Strange and bloudy was the Consequence of a small accident at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal.</HI> Upon <HI>April</HI> 10, 1506. many of the City went to the Church of St. <HI>Dominick</HI> to hear Mass; On the left side of this Church there is a Chappel much reverenced by those of the Countrey, and called <HI>Jesus Chappel;</HI> Upon the Altar there stands a Crucifix, the wound of whose side is covered over with a peice of Glass, some of those who came thither to do their Devotions casting their eyes upon this hole, it seemed to them that a kind of Glimmering Light came out of it; Then happy was he who could first cry a <HI>Miracle,</HI> and e∣very one said, <HI>That God shewed the Testimony of his
<PB N="57" REF="31"/>
presence;</HI> A Jew who was but lately become a Chri∣stian there, denied that it was any Miracle, saying, <HI>It was not likely that out of a dry piece of wood there should come such a Light.</HI> Now though many of the Spectators doubted of the Miracle, yet hearing a <HI>Jew</HI> deny it, they began to murmur, calling him, <HI>wicked Apostate and a detestable Enemy to Jesus Christ;</HI> After they had sufficiently reviled him in words, all the Multitude, foaming with rage, fall upon him, pluck off the hair of his head and Beard, tread up∣on him, and drawing him into the Church-yard, beat him to death, and kindling a great Fire, they cast the dead body into it, and burnt it to Ashes; All the residue of the People in the City ran to this mutinous Company, and among them, a certain Friar made a Sermon, wherein he vehemently stir∣red up his Auditors to revenge the injury which, he said, our Lord had received; The People furious of themselves, grew even stark mad with this Ex∣hortation, and besides this, two other Friars took and held up a Cross as high as they could, crying out, <HI>Revenge, Revenge, Heresie, Heresie, down with wicked Heresie, and destroy the wicked Nation.</HI> Here∣upon the Rabble like hungry Dogs fall upon the miserable <HI>Jews,</HI> cut the throats of a great number, and drag them to the Fires half dead, many being kindled for that purpose; They regarded neither Age nor Sex, but murdered Men, Women, and Chil∣dren, they broke open doors, rush into Rooms, dash out Childrens Brains against the Walls; They went insolently into Churches to pluck out thence the little Children, Old Men, and young Maids who had taken hold of the Altars, Crosses and Images of the Saints, who pitifully cryed out, <HI>Mercy, Mercy;</HI> yet they either murdered them there presently, or drew them out and threw them alive into the Fire; Ma∣ny that appeared, or looked like <HI>Jews,</HI> found them∣selves in great danger, some being killed, and others

wounded before they could make proof they had no Relation to them. Some who had a grudge a∣gainst others, did but cry, <HI>A Jew, a Jew,</HI> as they met them, and they were presently beaten down without having any Liberty or Leasure to answer for themselves. The Magistrates durst not oppose themselves against the Rage and Fury of the People, so that in three days time the Cut-throats murdered above a Thousand <HI>Jewish</HI> Persons. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> having notice of this horrible disturbance, was extreamly angry, and immediately dispatcht away <HI>Jaquez Almeida</HI> and <HI>Jaquez Lopez,</HI> with full power to punish so great Offences, who caused a great num∣ber of the Seditious to be executed, The Friars who had lifted up the Cross and animated the Peo∣ple to Murder were degraded, and afterward hang∣ed and burnt.

<P N="18">XVIII. Such another bloudy Event happened in <HI>Sicily</HI> in 1281. For <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Anjou</HI> Reigning in that Kingdom, and his Souldiers being all <HI>French∣men</HI> lying in Garrisons in the Cities, grew so odious to the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> that they studied nothing so much as how to be revenged on them, and to free themselves from the slavish Yoak of the <HI>French.</HI> The Cheif, and most Resolute in this business was called <HI>John Prochyto,</HI> who being justly incensed a∣gainst the <HI>French,</HI> who had ravished his Wife, and likewise dispossessed him of an Island whereof he was Lord; Provoked with these two Abuses, the injured Gentleman plots with King <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Aragon</HI> to make him Master of the Isle of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and find∣ing himself to be much favoured by the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Lords and Gentry, and the <HI>French</HI> by reason of

their Lusts and Insolencies having made the Natives ready for mischief, He by their Council and support begins to build a strange design for the entrapping all the <HI>French</HI> at once, and abolishing their Memory out of <HI>Sicily</HI> for ever; All which was so secretly carried for eighteen Months, that it hath ever since been ac∣counted a prodigious thing, that a design of this Nature could possibly be so long and safely conceal∣ed by so many People, and so different in Humour. The Watchword or signal was, That upon <HI>Easter</HI> day, when the Bell should begin to toll to Evening prayers, all the <HI>Sicilians</HI> should presently run to Arms, and joyning together with one accord, should fall upon all the <HI>French</HI> throughout <HI>Sicily;</HI> Accord∣ingly all the Inhabitants of the Isle were joined to∣gether at the appointed hour, and armed, ran upon the <HI>French,</HI> cut all their throats without taking so much as one Prisoner, or sparing the Children, or Women who were got with Child by the <HI>French,</HI> that they might utterly extinguish the whole race of them; There were slain eight Thousand at that time, and there escaped but a very small number who fled into a Fort called <HI>Sperling,</HI> where for want of Vi∣ctuals they were all starved to death; And <HI>Don Pedro</HI> having according to Agreement rigged out his Navy under pretence of some exploit against the <HI>Moors,</HI> came to an Anchor in the Port of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> there to expect how the Tragedy would be Acted, which falling out agreeably to his expectation, and coming in with his Navy just as the deed was done, he was by the General Consent of all sorts of Peo∣ple Crowned King of <HI>Sicily,</HI> and the Government thereof remains under the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to this day; This bloudy Massacre is called <HI>The Sicilian Vespers</HI> or <HI>Even Song</HI> to this day. <HI>Heylin's Cosmog.

Curiosity. In the Land of <HI>Transiane</HI> in the <HI>East-In∣dies,</HI> there was a Prince Tributary to the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and his near Kinsman named <HI>Alfonge,</HI> who married a Sister of the Prince of <HI>Tazatai</HI> called <HI>Abe∣lara,</HI> who was one of the greatest Beauties in all those Countreys. They lived a sweet and happy life with intire Affection, and for their greater Feli∣city, they had two Twin Sons, who in their young Age discovered something of great and lofty Minds; and appeared singularly hopeful for the future, These Infants being now Ten years old, loved so cordially, that they could not live asunder, and the desires of the one still met with the consent of the other in all things; But the Devil the Enemy of Con∣cord inspires a Curiosity into the minds of the Fa∣ther and Mother to know their Fates, or Fortunes; and to their greif they were told, <HI>The time should come when these two Brothers that now loved so fondly should cut one anothers Throats;</HI> Which much astonished the poor Princes, and filled them with fearful Appre∣hensions; The two Princes being come to their 15 years, one said to the other; <HI>Brother it must needs be that you must murther me, for I will sooner dye an hundred deaths than do you the least hurt imaginable.</HI> The other replied, <HI>Believe it not good Brother, I beseech you, for you are as dear or dearer to me than my self.</HI> But the Fa∣ther to prevent the misfortune resolved to separate them, whereupon they grew so troubled and Me∣lancholy, that he was constrained to delay his de∣sign till an occasion happened which invited all three, the Father and his two Sons to a War be∣twixt the Kings of <HI>Narsinga</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> upon Title of Territories. But by the Mediation of some Per∣sons a Peace was concluded upon Condition that these two young Princes should marry the two Daughters of the King of <HI>Narsinga,</HI> and that the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> should confer on him that married the elder all the Countreys he took in the last War,
<PB N="61" REF="33"/>
with the Kingdom of <HI>Martaban;</HI> and the other Bro∣ther besides the Kingdom of <HI>Tazatai</HI> should have that of <HI>Verma;</HI> The Nuptials consummated, each de∣parted to his Territory, Lands spaciously divided: Now it after happened that the King of <HI>Tazatai</HI> was engaged in a sharp War with the King of <HI>Man∣dranella,</HI> and sent to the two Brother Princes for Aid, who both hastened unknown to each other to his assistance. He from <HI>Verma</HI> came secretly to Town with one Servant only to visit a Lady who had been once their Ancient Mistris, and the other Brother being upon the same design, they met at the Ladies Gate by Night, not knowing one another, where fu∣rious with Jealousie, after some words they drew and killed each other; One of them dying gave humble thanks to Heaven for preventing the direful destiny foretold him, that he should kill his Bro∣ther; hereupon the other knowing by his Voice and Discourse, drawing near his end, himself crept to him and embraced him with Tears and Lamentations and so both dolefully ended their days together. The Father having tydings of it, and seeing his white hairs led by his own fault to so hard For∣tune, overborn with Grief and despair, came and slew himself upon the Bodies of his Sons, and with the greif and Tears of all the People were buried all three in one Monument, which shews us the Dan∣ger of too much Curiosity. <HI>Le Blanc's Travels.</HI> Tom. 1.</P>
<P N="20">XX. There is a Remarkable History of one <HI>Abner</HI> an Eastern King in the <HI>Indies,</HI> who having a Son born, gave immediate Order for his Confinement to a stately and spacious Castle, where he should be delicately brought up and carefully kept from hav∣ing any knowledge of Humane Calamities or Trou∣bles. And gave special command that no distressed Person should come into his Company, nothing sad,
<PB N="62" REF="34"/>
nothing Lamentable, nothing unfortunate, no poor man, no old man, none weeping nor disconsolate was to come near his Pallace; Youthfulness, Plea∣sures, and Joy were alwayes in his Presence, nothing else was to be seen, nothing else discoursed of in his Company. But alass in process of time the Prince longed, this made him sad in the very midst of his Joyes, and what should he long for, but not to be so cumbered with Delights; The grief of Plea∣sures made him request his Father to loose the Bonds of his miserable Felicity; This desire of the Son crossed the Intention of his Father, who was forced to give over his device to keep him from sadness, least by continuing it he should make him sad; He therefore gave him his Liberty, but charged his At∣tendants to remove out of his way all objects of Sor∣row; the blind, the maimed, the deformed and the old must not come near him. But what diligence is sufficient to conceal the Miseries of Mortality! The Prince in his Recreations meets with an old Man, Blind and Leprous; The sight astonishes him, he startles, trembles, and faints, like those that swound at the Apparition of a Spirit, and inquires of his Followers what that thing might be. And being told that it was Man, he was so extreamly concerned thereat, that he disliked Pleasures, condemned Mirth, and despised Life, he rejected the Kingdom and Royal Dignity, and bid adieu to all the Blandish∣ments of Fortune at once, spending the remainder of his days in a Religious Retirement from the vani∣ties of the World, and in preparations for Eternity. <HI>Vaughan Florilegus, pag.</HI> 126.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. The Ingenious Dr. <HI>R. Plat</HI> in his Natural History of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> gives an Acconnt of two strange Accidents which as he saith are to be reckon∣ed among those things which are unaccountable. One is, That in the year 1649 when the Commissi∣oners
<PB N="63" REF="34"/>
for surveying the Mannour House, Park, Deer, Woods and other the Demeasnes belonging to <HI>Woodstock Mannor</HI> in that County, came thither, and sat and lodged therein, they took up their Lodgings in the <HI>Bed-chamber</HI> and <HI>withdrawing Room</HI> thereof, the former whereof they also made their <HI>Kitchen,</HI> The <HI>Council Hall</HI> their <HI>Brewhouse,</HI> The <HI>Chamber of Presence</HI> they sate in to dispatch business, and made a <HI>Woodhouse</HI> of the <HI>Dining-room; October</HI> 14 and 15 they had little disturbance, but on the 16 there came as they thought somewhat into the <HI>Bedchamber</HI> where two of the Commissioners and their Servants lay, in the shape of a Dog, which going under their Beds did as it were gnaw their Bed-cords, but on the morning finding them whole, and a quarter of Beef which lay on the ground untouched; they began to entertain other thoughts. <HI>Octob.</HI> 17. Something to their thinking removed all the Wood out of the <HI>Dining-room</HI> into the <HI>Presence-Chamber,</HI> and hurled the Chairs and Stools up and down that room; From thence it came into the two Chambers where the Commissioners and their Servants lay, and hoisted up their Beds feet so much higher than their heads that they thought they should have been turned over and over, and then let them fall down with such a force that their bodies rebounded from the bed a good distance, and then shook the Bedsteads so vio∣lently that themselves confest their Bodies were sore with it. <HI>October</HI> 18 something came into the <HI>Bed-chamber</HI> and walkt up and down, and fetching the Warming Pan out of the <HI>withdrawing Room</HI> made so much noise that they thought five Bells could not have made more; And <HI>Octob.</HI> 19. Trenchers were thrown up and down the Dining Room, and at them that lodged there, whereof one of them being shaken by the Shoulder and awakened, put forth his head to see what was the matter, but had Trenchers thrown at it; <HI>October</HI> 20. The Curtains of
<PB N="64" REF="35"/>
the Bed in the <HI>withdrawing Room</HI> were drawn to and fro, and the Bed-stead much shaken, and eight great Pewter Dishes, and three dozen of Trenchers thrown about the <HI>Bedchamber</HI> again, whereof some fell upon the beds; this night they also thought whole Armfulls of Wood had been thrown down in their Chambers, but in the morning they found nothing moved.</P>
<P>On the 21 of <HI>October</HI> the keeper of their Ordi∣nary and his Bitch lay in one of the Rooms with them, which night they were not disturbed at all; But <HI>October</HI> 2. though the Bitch kenelled there again to whom they ascribed their former nights rest, both they and the Bitch were in a pitiful taking, the Bitch opening but once, and that with a whining fearful yelp. <HI>October</HI> 23. They had all their Cloths pluck'd off them in the <HI>withdrawing Room,</HI> and the Bricks fell out of the Chimney into the Room, and the 24th. day they thought all the Wood had been brought thither, and thrown down close by their Bedside, which noise being heard by those of the <HI>withdrawing Room;</HI> one of them rose to see what was done, fearing indeed that his Fellow Commissi∣oners had been killed, but found no such matter; whereupon returning to his bed again, he found two Dozen of Trenchers thrown into it, and hand∣somely covered with the Bed-clothes. <HI>October</HI> 25, The Curtains of the Bed in the <HI>withdrawing Room</HI> were drawn to and fro, and the Bed-stead shaken as before, and in the <HI>Bed-chamber,</HI> glass flew about so thick, that they thought it had been Money, (and yet not a pane of the Chamber Windows broken) but lighting a Candle, to their grief they found no∣thing but Glass, which they took up in the Morning and laid together. <HI>October</HI> 29, something walked in the <HI>withdrawing Room</HI> about an hour, and going to the Window opened and shut it, then going into the <HI>Bed-chamber,</HI> it threw great Stones for about half an
<PB N="65" REF="35"/>
hours time, some whereof lighted on the High-bed, and others on the Truckle-bed, to the number in all of about Fourscore; This night there was also a very great noise as though 40 pieces of Ordnance had been shot off together; at two several knocks it astonished all the Neighbouring Dwellers, which its thought might have been heard a great way off; During these noises which were heard in both Rooms together, both Commissioners and Servants were struck with so great horror, that they cryed out to one another for help, whereof one of them recover∣ing himself out of a strange Agony he had been in, snatched up a Sword, and had like to have killed one of his Fellows, coming out of his bed in his shirt, whom took for the Spirit who did the mischief; However at length they got all together, yet the noise contin∣ued so great and Terrible, and shook the Walls so much, that they thought the whole House would have fallen on their Heads. At its departure it took all the Glass away with it.</P>
<P>The 1. of <HI>November,</HI> something as they thought walked up and down the <HI>withdrawing Room,</HI> and then made a noise in the <HI>Dining-room;</HI> The Stones that were left before and laid up in the <HI>withdrawing room</HI> were all fetched away this night, and a great deal of Glass, not like the former thrown about again. <HI>No∣vember</HI> 2. came something into the <HI>withdrawing Room,</HI> treading as they conceived much like a Bear, which first only walking about a quarter of an hour, at length it made a noise about the Table, and threw the Warming-Pan so violently, that it quite spoiled it; It threw also glass and great Stones at them again, and the bones of Horses, and all so violently that the bed-stead and walls were bruised by them. This night they set Candles all about the Rooms, and made Fires up to the Mantle Trees of the Chimneys; but all were put out, no body knew how, the Fire and Billets that made it being thrown up and down the
<PB N="66" REF="36"/>
Rooms; the Curtains torn with the Rods from their Beds, and the Bed-posts pulled away, that the Tester fell down upon them, and the feet of the Bedsted was cloven in two; And upon the Servants in the Truc∣kle Bed, who lay all the time sweating for fear, there fell first a little water, which made them begin to stir; but before they could get out, there came a whole Tub full, as it were of stinking Ditch∣water down upon them, so green that it made their Sheets and Shirts of the same colour too.</P>
<P>The same night the Windows were all broken by throwing of Stones, and there were most terrible noises in three several places together, to the extra∣ordinary wonder of all that lodged near them. Nay, the very Coney-stealers that were abroad that night, were so affrighted with the dismal Thundering that for hast they lest their Ferret in the Coney Burroughs behind them beyond <HI>Rosamond</HI>'s Wells; notwith∣standing all this, one of them had the boldness to ask, <HI>In the name of God, what it was? what it would have, and what they had done that they should be disturbed in this manner?</HI> To which no Answer was given, but the Noise ceased for a while; At length it came again, and as all of them said, brought seven Devils worse than it self; whereupon one of them lighted a Candle again, and set it between the two Chambers in the door way, on which another of them fix∣ing his eyes, saw the similitude of a hoof striking the Candle and Candlestick into the midst of the Cham∣ber, and afterwards making three scrapes on the snuff to put it out. Upon this the same Person was so bold as to draw his Sword, but he had scarce got it out but there was another invisible hand had hold of it too, and tugged with him for it, and getting it from him, struck him so violently with the Pummel that he was stunned with the Blow; Then began grievous noises again, insomuch that they called to
<PB N="67" REF="36"/>
one another, got together, and went into the <HI>Pre∣sence Chamber,</HI> where they said Prayers and sung Psalmes, notwithstanding all which the thundring noise still continued in other Rooms. After this, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 3. they removed their Lodgings over the Gate; and next day being <HI>Sunday</HI> to <HI>Ewelm,</HI> but returning on Monday, the Devil, (for that was the name they gave their nightly Guest) left them not unvisited, nor on the Tuesday following, which was the last day they stayed. On Wednesday the Com∣missioners and their Dependants went quite away, and those that lived at the place affirm, that after∣ward several Persons of good quality lodged in the same room but were never disturbed.</P>
<P>I had several Relations of these strange Passages (saith my Author) put into my hands, and one of them written by a learned and faithful Person then living upon the place, which being confirmed to me by several Eye-witnesses of many of the particulars, and all of them by one of the Comissioners them∣selves, who ingeniously confessed to me, that he could not deny but what was written by that Per∣son above-mentioned was all true, I was prevailed on at last to make the Relation Publick, though I must confess, I have no great esteem for such kind of stories, many of them no question being perform∣ed by Combination, and so might some of these Transactions aforesaid: But there are others which are scarce reconcileable to Contrivance or Jugling. As 1. Such extraordinary Noises beyond the power of Man to make, without such Instruments as were not there. 2. The tearing down and splitting the Bed-posts, and putting out so many Candles, and so great Fires no body knew how. 3. A visible shape seen of a Horses hoof treading out the Candle; And 4. A tugging with one of them for his Sword, by an Invisible hand. All which being put together, perhaps may easily perswaded some man otherwise

The same ingenious Dr. <HI>Platt</HI> gives a Relation of another strange and unaccountable accident, which he delivers with the same certainty as the former; That of the Family of one Captain <HI>Wood,</HI> formerly of <HI>Bampton,</HI> then of <HI>Brise Norton</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> Cap∣tain in the late Wars for the King; some of them have had signal warnings given them before their Deaths by a certain knocking either at the door without, or on the Tables and Shelves within, the number of Stroaks and distance between them, and the place where, for the most part respecting the Circumstances of the Persons to dye, or their deaths themselves, as will easily be collected from the fol∣lowing Instances; The first knocking that was heard or at least observed, was about a year after the Re∣stauration of the King, 1661, in the afternoon, a little before night, at or upon the door, it being then open, as it was apprehended by Mrs. <HI>Eleano Wood,</HI> Mother to Captain <HI>Basil Wood,</HI> who only heard it, none being then by, or about the house but her self, at which she was very much disturbed, thinking it foretold some ill to her, or hers, and within four∣teen days after she had news of the death of her Son in Law, Mr. <HI>George Smith,</HI> who dyed in <HI>London.</HI> About three years after that, there were three great knocks very audibly given, and heard by all then in the house; who were Mrs. <HI>Eleanor Wood</HI> aforesaid, Mr. <HI>Basil Wood,</HI> and his Wife, Mrs. <HI>Hester,</HI> and some Servants; which knocks were so remarkable, that one of the Maids came from the Well which was about 20 yards from the place, to see what was the
<PB N="69" REF="37"/>
matter; and Mrs. <HI>Eleanor Wood,</HI> and another Maid who was within the House saw three great Pans of Lard shake and totter so upon a shelf in the Milk∣house that they were like to fall down. Upon this violent knocking Mr. <HI>Basil Wood</HI> and his Wife being then in the Hall, came presently into the Milkhouse to their Mother, where finding her somewhat di∣sturbed, and enquiring the reason, she replyed, <HI>God Almighty only knew the matter, she could tell nothing, but she heard the knocking;</HI> which being within doors, Mr. <HI>Basil Wood</HI> concluded it was a fatal warning to some of the Family at home; since the other upon the door without signified death to some Friend abroad, which accordingly fell out, for three of the Family according to the number of the knocks died within half an year after, that is Mrs. <HI>Hester Wood,</HI> Wife to Mr. <HI>Basil Wood,</HI> a Child of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s Sister, and Mrs. <HI>Eleanor Wood</HI> his Mother. About <HI>August</HI> 1674, Mr. <HI>Basil Wood</HI> Junior, Son of <HI>Basil</HI> aforesaid, living at <HI>Exeter</HI> in <HI>Devonshire</HI> heard the same kind of knock∣ing, at which being disturbed he writ word of it to his Father at <HI>Bampton</HI> in <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> That one Sun∣day, He, his Wife, and her Sister, and his Brother did distinctly hear upon a Table in their Chamber, as they stood by it, two several knocks struck as it were with a Cudgel, one of them before and the other after Morning Prayer, a little before dinner; which Letter was shewn by Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> Senior (as the other knockings before the deaths of any that died were beforehand told) to several Neighbouring Gen∣tlemen, after which within about fourteen dayes Mrs. <HI>Hester Wood,</HI> a second Wife of Mr. <HI>Basil Wood</HI> Senior, and about a quarter of a year after her Father Mr. <HI>Richard Lisset</HI> died both at <HI>Bampton,</HI> since which time they have heard nothing more as yet, <HI>Natural History</HI> Oxfordshire. <HI>pag.</HI> 206.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. Of this kind of unaccountable Accidents
<PB N="70" REF="38"/>
we may reckon that which is related by Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> in his 2d. Vol. of Examples, which he intitles, A True and faithful Relation of one <HI>Samuel Wallas,</HI> who was restored to his perfect health after 13 years sickness of a Consumption, taken from his own mouth, who for the last four years lay bedrid, and so weak that he could not turn himself therein without help, by which Distemper his body was so parched and dryed that he was like an Anatomy, but upon this cure he recovered his former health and strength, whereby he was inabled to follow his Trade being a Shoe∣maker, and living at <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where∣of he gave this following Account with much affe∣ction and sensibleness of Divine Mercy and Good∣ness to him, upon <HI>April</HI> 7. 1659.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Whitsunday</HI> last before the date hereof, about six a Clock in the afternoon after evening Sermon, he finding himself a little lightsome, and able to get out of his Bed without help there being no body in the house then with him, his wife being gone in the Countrey to her Friends to seek some releif, he crept to the Fire-side, and as he was reading in a book called, <HI>Abraham</HI>'s suit for <HI>Sodom,</HI> he heard some bo∣dy rap at the door, and thinking it to be some stran∣ger, because he struck as it were with a stick, and be∣ing on the Lords day; thereupon taking his stick in one hand, and holding by the Wall with the other, he went to the door and opening it, he saw a proper grave old man, who said unto him, <HI>Friend I pray thee give to an old Pilgrim a Cup of small Beer;</HI> to whom <HI>Wallas</HI> said, <HI>Pray Sir come in;</HI> He answered, <HI>Call me not Sir for I am none, but yet come in I must, for I cannot pass by thy door.</HI> To whom <HI>Wallas</HI> thinking he had been very dry, said, <HI>Come in Sir and welcome,</HI> which he did, and <HI>Wallas</HI> with the help of his stick drew him a Cup of Beer, who took it and drank a little, and then walked two or three times to and fro, and drank again, and so a third time before he dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk it
<PB N="71" REF="38"/>
all up, and setting down the pot, <HI>Wallas</HI> thought he was going, but he walked again backward and for∣ward three or four times, neither of them speaking a word to each other; At last the old Man coming up to <HI>Wallas</HI> said, <HI>Friend I perceive thou art not well; No truly,</HI> said <HI>Wallas, I have not been well these many years. What is thy disease,</HI> said he? <HI>Wallas</HI> replied, <HI>a deep Consumption, and our Doctors say it is past cure; They said well,</HI> answered he; <HI>but what have they given thee for it? Truly nothing,</HI> said <HI>Wallas, for I am a very poor man, and not able to follow the Doctors prescriptions, and so I have been willing to commit my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the hands of Almighty God, to dispose of me as he pleaseth.</HI> The Old man answered, <HI>in that thou sayst very well; But I will tell thee by the Almighty power of God what thou shalt do, only remember my words, and observe them and do it; But whatsoever thou dost, fear God and serve him; To morrow morning go into thy Garden, and get there two red Sage Leaves, and one leaf of Bloodwort, and put these three leaves into a Cup of small Beer, and let them lye there∣in three days; and drink thereof as oft as thy need requir∣eth, but let the leaves still remain in the Cup; and the fourth Morning cast them away, and put three fresh ones in their room, and thus do for</HI> 12 <HI>daies together neither more nor less, and I pray remember what I say, and observe my words and do it; But above all whatsoever thou dost, Fear God, and serve him; And for the space of these</HI> 12 <HI>daies thou must neither drink Ale nor strong Beer, yet afterward thou maist to strengthen Nature, and thou shalt find that before these twelve daies be expired, through the great Mercy and help of Almighty God, thy Disease will be cured, and the frame of thy body altered.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Wallas</HI> doubting the truth of these things said to the old man, <HI>Sir, is it good for all Consumptions?</HI> To which he replyed, <HI>I tell thee, I tell thee, observe what I say unto thee and do it, but above all, whatsoever thou dost, Fear God and serve him. Yet,</HI> said he, <HI>this is not all, for thou must also change the Air for thy healths
<PB N="72" REF="39"/>
sake;</HI> To which <HI>Wallas</HI> replyed, <HI>what do you mean Sir by changing the Air;</HI> He answered, <HI>Thou must go three or four miles off, or if it be twenty miles, the farther the bet∣ter, and this thou must do as speedily as thou canst after the twelve daies are over, or else thou wilt have a greivous fit of sickneiss which will suddenly seize upon thee, yet through Gods Mercy by doing this, thou maist avoid that, and thou shalt see that before the twelve dayes be ended, through the help of Almighty God thou wilt scarce be able to wear the Cloths now on thy back with ease, thy body will be grown so much, and I pray thee remember my words and observe to do them, but above all whatsoever thou dost, Fear God and serve him.</HI></P>
<P>Then said <HI>Wallas, Pray Sir if it shall please God to enable me to go into our own Fields two or three times a day will not that serve the turn;</HI> The old man answer∣ed, <HI>Friend it will not, for that Air where the Infection is taken is not so proper for the Cure of the disease;</HI> said <HI>Wallas, I thought to have been let bloud; No friend,</HI> said the old man, <HI>by no means, for before thy twelve daies be expired thy bloud will be as good as ever it was in all thy life, yet this one thing observe, Thy joints will be weak as long as thou livest; Now Friend I must be going, pray re∣member what I have said and do it, but above all fear God and serve him.</HI> Then <HI>Wallas</HI> asked him to eat; But he refused saying, <HI>No Friend I will not eat any thing, the Lord Christ is sufficient for me, neither do I drink any beer but very seldom, but that which comes from the Rock, and so friend the Lord in Heaven be with thee.</HI> When <HI>Wallas</HI> saw him go out of doors, he went to shut the door after him; But the old man returned half way into the entry again, and said, <HI>Friend, I pray remem∣ber what I have said unto thee and do it, But above all whatsoever thou dost, Fear God and serve him;</HI> and so they parted.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Wallas</HI> saith, he saw him pass along the streets some sixty yards from his door, and so he went in; But this old man was not seen to pass a∣long
<PB N="73" REF="39"/>
the Streets by any one else, though some Persons were standing in their doors opposite to <HI>Wallas</HI> his house; After <HI>Wallas</HI> had made use of the leaves a∣forementioned about four days, there arose a Scurff upon his Body, and when that was gone a new skin came under it like that of a sucking Child, and by the end of the twelve days he was as healthful and strong as ever he had been, only he said when he went to sit down his knees would smite together, so that he still found a weakness in his joints as was fore∣told him; He said likewise that one day within the time prescribed by the sollicitation of some Friends he drank a little strong drink, and immediately his Speech was taken from him for the space of 24 hours. As for the Description of this old mans Per∣son and Habit, he thus related it; He was tall and Ancient, his hair as white as Wool curled up, with a white broad beard, and of a fresh Complexion, he wore a fashionable Hat, and a little narrow band; His Coat and Hose were both of a purple Colour, his Stockings pure, with a pair of new black shoes tyed with Ribbons of the same Colour with his Cloths, and though it rained when he came into <HI>Wallas</HI> his house and all that day, as many remembred, yet he had not one spot of wet or dirt upon him; He had no Gloves, but his hands were as white as Snow; This strange accident being related abroad, several Reverend Divines met together about it at <HI>Stamford,</HI> to consider and consult about it, and for many rea∣sons, saith Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> were induced to believe that this Cure was wrought by the Ministry of a good Angel. <HI>Clark's Mirrour, Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>pag.</HI> 18.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. I will add one History more of this kind which I find related in a <HI>German</HI> Author; In the year 1626, there was in <HI>Silesia</HI> one <HI>Christopher Cotterus,</HI> whom the Famous <HI>German</HI> Divine, <HI>Johannes Comenius</HI> judges to be a Prophet; This man had many ene∣mies
<PB N="74" REF="40"/>
and among the rest one <HI>David Wacksman,</HI> the Emperors Prefect for gathering his Tributes in the lower <HI>Silesta,</HI> and <HI>Lusatia;</HI> He swore that he would never rest till he saw <HI>Cotterus,</HI> and <HI>Mincelius</HI> a <HI>Prote∣stant</HI> Minister hanged upon the same Gallows in the City of <HI>Sprotovia</HI> where they lived; Their Friends informed them hereof, which caused them with greater fervency to commend themselves to God; yet <HI>Cotterus</HI> by a strong Impulse of Spirit resolved to go to <HI>Glogow,</HI> and though his Friends would have disswaded him, yet <HI>Jan.</HI> 2. 1627, he went thither, where being known he was apprehended, and car∣ried before the Count of <HI>Oppersdorf,</HI> and the afore∣said Prefect, who after Examination committed them to Prison. The next day a Commissary was sent to <HI>Sprotovia,</HI> with a Command to the Senate that he should before some of them search all the house and Coffers of <HI>Cotterus,</HI> for writings, and like-<HI>Mencelius</HI> his house in the same manner; This was done, and the Writings were by the Commissary car∣ried to them, which they read and examined, but all his Prophecies were not found; <HI>January</HI> 25, <HI>Cot∣terus</HI> was again examined more strictly whence he had those Prophecies, He answered, <HI>Not from any mor∣tal man, but from spirits that used to appear to him, but whether they were Good or Bad Angels, he left it to the learned to judge;</HI> The Count upon certain Conditions would have released him, but the Prefect strongly opposing it, charged him with Treason against the Emperor, and required that <HI>Mincelius</HI> might likewise be sent for; The Senate sent with him two of their Magistrates, in whose presence <HI>Mincelius</HI> was charged to be guilty of Death (who it seems writ out those Prophecies) which they said were Lyes, and to the great dishonour of the Emperor; <HI>Mincelius</HI> pleaded, <HI>That he was enjoyned by the Senate to do it,</HI> which the Magistrates also affirmed. The Prefect appealed then to the Council of <HI>Prague,</HI> and commanded that
<PB N="75" REF="40"/>
<HI>Mincelius</HI> should be kept under an Arrest till he had answered them; The Consuls that came with him protested against this, affirming, <HI>That their City could not want his Ministry,</HI> offering to stand bound for his appearance and at length they prevailed after hav∣ing given a Bond of Two Thousand Crowns for his forth coming.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Prefect poured out all his Indigna∣tion upon <HI>Cotterus,</HI> removing him from his former Prison into a Dungeon where Malefactors used to be Tortured, wherein he lay in Hunger, Dirt and Cold for above three Months; Now a special Providence from Heaven appeared, For <HI>Cotterus</HI> his Enemies understood that a compleat Book of all his Prophe∣cies was in the hand of a Citizen of <HI>Sprotovia;</HI> This they got, and carried it to the Governour of <HI>Oppers∣dorf,</HI> who after he had read it, was much taken with <HI>Cotterus,</HI> and would no more meddle against him; He also perswaded the Prefect to have his cause heard in the City of <HI>Glogow,</HI> and prevailed that <HI>Cotterus</HI> should have an Advocate allowed him. In the mean time the Prefect married a Noble Virgin, and at the weeks end his Office necessitated him to go <HI>Sagan,</HI> and in his return he was to lye at <HI>Sprotovia;</HI> but as soon as he came into the Suburbs of that City, he was taken with a violent pain in his Bowels; whereupon he sent for a Physitian, who not knowing what to make of his Disease, forbore to administer any thing to him till the next Morning that he might see farther. But it pleased God the Praefect died that night, and in that very place where he had sworn to see these men hanged. This dreadful Judg∣ment being known to the Enemies of <HI>Cotterus,</HI> they removed him out of the Dungeon into a better Pri∣son, and after some Months space they sentenced him, and brought him to the Town-Stocks, fasten∣ed a Collar of Iron about his Neck, and set over his head a Paper thus written; <HI>This is the false Prophet
<PB N="76" REF="41"/>
which foretold such things as came not to pass;</HI> There he stood an hour, after which he was banished out of all the Emperors Dominions upon pain of death.</P>
<P>From hence he went to <HI>Lusatia</HI> under the Ju∣risdiction of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> where he lived quietly till the day of his death, which was in the year 1647. But before this, that is in 1628 when the Persecution grew hot in <HI>Silesia,</HI> there was in the City of <HI>Spretovia,</HI> one <HI>Adam Pohl,</HI> a good Friend to <HI>Cotterus,</HI> who knowing the great want, and necessity he was brought unto, not through any fault of his own but by Gods Providence, he enter∣tained him at his house <HI>gratis,</HI> and <HI>Cotterus</HI> continu∣ed with him by the space of half a year to the time of his Imprisonment. During which time <HI>Adam Pohl</HI> fell dangerously sick, and after a while had his Nerves and Sinews so shrunk up, that he could make no use of his Legs, but for a half a year toge∣ther was confined to his Bed; But it pleased God that the very morning before the Emperours Com∣missioners came with Armed Troops to reform the City (as they called it) his Wife being risen and gone down, there appeared by his Bedside a young man in white Clothing, who after he had saluted him, said, Adam, <HI>This is the day wherein God hath decreed to take Vengeance upon the Citizens of this City for their Ingratitude, Arise go in the name of the Lord, put on thy Cloths, take thy wife and young Daughter, and fly from hence, make hast;</HI> and so he disappeared; After which <HI>Pohl</HI> prayed earnestly, and then began to move his hands and feet, and trying to rise, found that he could stand on his feet, whereupon he called to his Wife for his Cloths, which had been laid up in a Chest all that half year of his lameness, and when he was drest, he fell down on his knees and praised God; Then taking his Wife and Daughter, he hasted to the City-gate, and having sent for <HI>Mincelius</HI> to meet him there (who was astonished to
<PB N="77" REF="41"/>
see him) with sighs and Tears they took Council together, and resolved to go to <HI>Gorlits</HI> (and by Gods strength, and as he judged the Ministry of an Angel,) he and his little Daughter went afoot eight miles that day. <HI>Historia Prophetarum. pag.</HI> 22.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. <HI>Linschoten</HI> in his Discoveries and Voyages to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> gives this Account; That in the Island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> there is a high Hill, upon the top whereof standeth a great House as big as a Cloyster; In this place in time past, shrined in Gold and pre∣cious Stones, was kept the Tooth of an Ape, which was esteemed the holiest thing in all <HI>India,</HI> and had the greatest resort to it from all the Countries round about it, so that it surpassed St. <HI>James</HI> in <HI>Gallicia,</HI> and St. <HI>Michaels Mount</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> by reason of the great Indulgences and Pardons that were there daily to be had; For which cause it was sought unto with much Devotion, by all the <HI>Indians</HI> within four or five hundred Miles round about in vast multitudes; But it happened that in the year 1554, when the <HI>Portugals</HI> made a Road out of <HI>India,</HI> and entred the Island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> they went up upon the Hill, where they thought to find great Treasure, because of the Fame that was spread abroad of the great resort and Offerings in that place; They diligently searched the Cloister, and turned up every Stone thereof, yet found nothing but a little Coffer made fast with many precious Stones wherein lay the Apes Tooth; This Relique they took with them to <HI>Goa,</HI> which when the Kings of <HI>Pegu, Siam, Bengala, Bisnagar,</HI> and o∣thers heard of, they were much greived that so cost∣ly a Jewel was in that manner taken from them; Whereupon by Common Consent they sent their Ambassadors to the Vice-Roy of <HI>India,</HI> desiring him of all Friendship to send them their Apes Tooth a∣gain, offering him for a Ransom (besides other Pre∣sents, which they then sent to him) seven Hundred Thousand Duckets in Gold, which the Vice-Roy for
<PB N="78" REF="42"/>
Covetousness of the Money did intend to do. But the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa</HI> disswaded him from it, say∣ing; <HI>That they being Christians ought not to give it to them again, being a thing wherewith Idolatry might be furthered, and the Devil worshipped; but rather were bound by their Profession to root out, and abolish all Ido∣latry, and Superstition,</HI> By this means the Vice-Roy was perswaded to change his Mind, and flatly denied the Embassadors Request, having in their Presence first burnt the Apes Tooth, the Ashes whereof he caused to be thrown into the Sea; The Embassadors departed, astonished that he refused so great a sum of Money for a thing which he so little esteemed; Not long after there was a <HI>Benjane</HI> or Priest that had got∣ten another Apes Tooth, and gave out that he had Miraculously found the same Apes Tooth that the Vice-Roy had, and that it was revealed unto him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Pagod (that is one of their Gods) in a Vision tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assured him it was the same, which he said the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tugals</HI> thought they had burned, but that he had been there invisible, and taken it away, laying another in the place. This the Heathens presently believed, so that it came unto the King of <HI>Bisnager's</HI> ears who thereupon desired the <HI>Benjane</HI> to send it him; With great Joy he received it, giving the <HI>Benjane</HI> a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sum of Gold for it; whereupon this Tooth was hol∣den and kept in the same Honour and Estimation, a the other that was burnt had been. <HI>Linschotens Voy∣ages, lib.</HI> 1.</P>

to us in this part of the World, I shall give some further Relations of this kind, that thereby we may be thankful to God for the Knowledge he has be∣stowed upon us.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> amongst the many Animals which they esteemed as Gods did especially Worship an Ox which they called <HI>Apis;</HI> He was black, and remarkable for some spots of white; and in his Tongue and Tail different from all others. The day in which he was Calved was held as a Festival throughout the whole Nation. At <HI>Arsinoe</HI> they Worship the Crocodile; At the City of <HI>Hercules,</HI> the <HI>Ichneumon,</HI> a Creature that is an Enemy to the Croco∣dile; Others of them adore a Cat; some a Falcon; others the Bird <HI>Ibis;</HI> In the Island of <HI>Java</HI> they Worship whatsoever it is they first meet, and chance to see in the Morning, and pray to it all the day al∣though it be a Hog, or a worse thing. They of <HI>Cale∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut</HI> Worship the Statue of the Devil; the Chappel in which he is adored is not above three paces from the ground, in the midst of it is a Throne, and a Brazen Statue that is framed sitting in it, with a Diadem about his head, like the Pontifical Mitre a∣mongst the <HI>Romans;</HI> He hath 4 large Horns upon his Head, his Mouth stretched out to an unreasonable wideness, a crooked Nose, threatning Eyes, Cruel Countenance, crooked Hands and Feet like those of a Cock, which put together render the Devil wick∣edly deformed. Those of the Province of <HI>Manta</HI> Worship an Emerauld, a great and beautiful Jewel, and this they esteem of as the True Deity, the sick come in Pilgrimage to visit it, and there offer their Gifts, which the Preists turn to their own profit. The Inhabitants of <HI>Nagapatan</HI> have a Massy Copper gild∣ed Pagod, or Idol, mounted upon a Triumphant Chariot moved by eight mighty wheels, over-laid with pure Gold, The Ascent is easie, spacious, and by many steps, on which are placed on a solemn day the Priests, and many young Maidens, who to
<PB N="80" REF="43"/>
enrich the Devil Prostitute their Bodies to the lust∣ful Flames of wicked men; Happy is that man, rich or poor, high or low, who can fasten an hand to draw the Chariot; yea, they account them happi∣est who out of a frantick zeal furiously throw their naked Bodies in the way, that by the vast weight of the Pagod and his Chariot their wretched Bodies may be crushed in peices, being for this thought Martyrs; and such is the stupid folly of these Men, that they perswade their Daughters to become Strum∣pets to please their Pagods, insomuch that it is a great wonder to see so many Girls at such immatu∣rity so impudently delighted with the impure Con∣versation of silthy Men. <HI>Herbert's Travels, lib.</HI> 3.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. In the City of <HI>Meaco,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Japan,</HI> besides 70 Temples, wherein they number three Thousand three hundred thirty three Manada's or little Idols, there is one more notable than the rest, like the <HI>Rhodian</HI> Coloss, huge and wonderful; It was built by <HI>Tycho-zamnia,</HI> and without much pain and cost was not finished; It was framed of gilded Copper, its posture is sitting in a Chair of 70 Foot high, and 80 broad. His Head capable to support fifteen men, who may stand together upon it with∣out pressing; His Thumb is 40 Inches about, and his other Limbs proportionable. At <HI>Dabys</HI> is ano∣ther <HI>Manada</HI> or Idol no less infamous, and resorted unto; This Devil or <HI>Moloch</HI> is of Concave Copper, vast thick, and double gilded, its height is 24 foot, and would be more, but that they have formed it kneeling; His Buttocks resting upon his Legs after the usual mode of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Pagans; His Arms are stretcht to the uttermost, and at Solemn times is made Red hot within, and sacrificed unto by offer∣ing him a Child, which in his embraces is fryed to death in an Infernal Torture. But more of note is <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uchedy</HI> Eastward thence, where Satan visibly plays the Impostor; The Fotigue or Temple there, is of a rare Structure, and daily served by a multitude of

Hellish <HI>Bonzees</HI> or Priests, not admitted to attend there, except they be young, well shaped, and stout Disciples of <HI>Venus.</HI> Every New Moon they solemnly betroth to the Devil a Damsel, whose Parents account the Ceremony happy and Honourable. If any be more fair and singular than another, she is chosen out by the lustful Priests, Devoted and brought into the Temple, and placed right against the <HI>Manada</HI> or Idol. The Room is first made glorious with Lamps of Burnished Gold, and a preparation by the Burning of <HI>Lignum vitae,</HI> Gums and perfumes, such as are most curious and costly; By and by the Lamps extinguish by a kind of pretended Miracle, and in a gross darkness the Prince of Darkness approaches, and enjoys her as she imagines, and it is the rather credited because the Devil leaves behind him certain Scales like those of Fishes, which is an Argument that it is no Phantasm, but by this Hellish Conjun∣ction they swell not, unless the <HI>Bonzee</HI> or Priest se∣cond it; Satan is no sooner gone, but she is saluted by the <HI>Bonzees,</HI> who ravish her with Songs and plea∣sant Musick, which ended she acquaints them with her Fortune, and resolves them in such questions as she by their instruction propounded to the Devil, and he satisfied her in; she comes out from thence with applause, and ever after is reputed Holy and Honourable. <HI>Herbert's Travels, lib.</HI> 3.</P>

made before him. The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> worshipped this Idol under the name of <HI>Saturn;</HI> and indeed <HI>Baal,</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> and <HI>Moloch</HI> are reputed to be all one. The Image of this Idol was of Brass, wonder∣ful for its greatness, having the face of a Bullock, and Arms spread abroad like a man that openeth his hands to receive something of another. This Image was hollow, and had seven Closets or Apartments within; One for Wheat-Flower of the finest, a se∣cond for Turtles, a third for a Sheep, a fourth for a Ram, a fifth for a Calf, a sixth for an Ox; and to him that would offer his Son or Daughter a seventh Concave or Chamber was opened; and then while the Child was burning in the Idol, with the Fire that was made under him, the Parents and such as were present were to Dance, and to play upon Tim∣brels, and beat upon Drums, that they might not hear the Sorrowful cryes of their Child while thus Sacrificing. <HI>Anammeleck</HI> and <HI>Adrameleck</HI> the Gods of <HI>Sepharvaim</HI> mentioned 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 17, are supposed to be the same with this Idol, whose Priests were called <HI>Chemarim</HI> from their blackness; The place of this Idol amongst the <HI>Israelites</HI> was <HI>Tophet,</HI> the Valley of the Sons of <HI>Hinnom</HI> that is, <HI>Of Lamentation or Roar∣ing,</HI> from the cryes of them that were offered. The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> being greatly distressed by <HI>Agathocles,</HI> they barbarously at one time offered, or burnt to this <HI>Moloch</HI> (their <HI>Saturn</HI>) no less than two hundred choice Youths of their Nobility. This Idolatrous Custom continued to the days of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> The <HI>Phi∣listines,</HI> and all that Seacoast were called <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> and they Worshipped <HI>Dagon;</HI> what <HI>Dagon</HI> was, saith <HI>P. Martyr</HI> is not well known, but by the derivation of his name, which signifieth a <HI>Fish,</HI> it seems he was a Sea-god; Above his Belly he was of Humane shape, beneath like a Fish. When <HI>Cicero</HI> saith, <HI>The</HI> Syrians <HI>worshipped a Fish, it may be supposed to be this</HI> Dagon, and it may be they intended <HI>Neptune</HI> (saith <HI>P. Martyr</HI>) or I know not what Devil; <HI>Lucian</HI> saith, he saw the
<PB N="83" REF="44"/>
Image of it in <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> not unlike that of a Mermaid the upper half like a Woman, and the lower like a Fish, in reverence of whom, the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were said to abstain from Fish. They offer to it, Fishes of Gold and Silver, and the Priests all day long set be∣fore it true Fishes roasted and Boiled, which after∣wards themselves did eat, At <HI>Ekron</HI> was worshipped <HI>Baalzebub,</HI> that is, <HI>The Lord of Flies;</HI> so called either from the abundance of Flyes that attended the multi∣tude of his Sacrifices, from which inconvenience it is said, the Sacrifices to the true God in the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> were wholly free, or because he was the God of their Larder or Buttery to drive away Flies, or for that he was Worshipped in the form of a Fly; though others write, that it was a name given him in Scorn and Derision, calling him the <HI>Fly Lord.

<P N="29">XXIX. Some Leagues from the Town of <HI>Junquilen</HI> in <HI>China</HI> (saith <HI>Ferd. Pinto</HI> in his Travels) we arrived at a place incompassed with great Iron Gates, in the midst whereof stood two mighty Statues of Brass upright, sustained by Pillars of Cast Mettal of the bigness of a Bushel, and seven Fathom high, the one of a Man, the other of a Woman, both of them 74 spans in height, having their hands in their Mouths, their Cheeks horribly blown out, and their Eyes so staring that they affrighted all who looked upon them; Having demanded of the <HI>Chineses</HI> the mean∣ing of these Figures, they told us, <HI>That the Male was he which with those mighty swoln Cheeks blew the Fire of Hell to torment all those miserable wretches that would not liberally bestow Alms in this Life; And for the other Mon∣ster that she was the Portress of Hell gates, where she would take notice of all those that did her good in this World, and letting them fly away into a River of very cold water would keep them hid there from being tormented by the Devils as other Damned were.</HI> At such time as we arrived there; we found twelve <HI>Bonzoes</HI> or Priests
<PB N="84" REF="45"/>
upon the Place, and with Silver Censers full of Per∣fumes of Aloes and Benzoin, they smoke those two Devilish Monsters, and chanted out aloud, <HI>Help us even as we serve thee,</HI> whereunto divers other Priests answered in the name of the Idol with a great noise; <HI>So I promise to do like a good Lord.</HI> In this manner they went as it were in a Procession round about the place, singing with an ill-tuned Voice to the sound of a great many Bells that were in Steeples thereabout. In the mean time there were others that with Drums and Basons made such a noise, as I may truly say, put them all together, was most hor∣rible to hear. <HI>Pinto's Travels, ch.</HI> 28.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. The same Author proceeds thus; We ar∣rived, saith he, at the great Temple of <HI>Snignafatur</HI> in <HI>Tartary,</HI> where we saw an inclosure of above 3 Miles in Circuit, in which were built 164 Houses, very long and broad, after the fashion of Arsenals, all full of up to the very Tiles of Dead mens Skulls, whereof there was so great a number that I am loth to speak it, since it will hardly be credited, without each of these Houses were also great Piles of Bones belonging to these heads, which were three fathom higher than the Ridges of them, so that the Houses seemed to be buried, no other part of them appear∣ing but the Frontispiece where the Gate stood. Not far from thence upon the Southside of them was a kind of Platform, whereunto the ascent was by cer∣tain Stairs of Iron winding about, and through four several doors; Upon this Platform was one of the Tallest, the most deformed, and dreadful Monsters that can possibly be imagined, standing upon his feet, and leaning against a mighty Tower of hewen Stone. It was made of cast Iron, and of so great and Prodi∣gious a Stature that by guess he seemed to be above thirty fathom high, and more than six broad. This Monster held in both his hands a Globe of the same Iron, being thirty six spans in the compass of it; we demanded of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Ambassador the explication
<PB N="85" REF="45"/>
of so Monstrous a thing, <HI>You must know,</HI> said he, <HI>that this great Saint which you see here, is the Treasurer of the bones of all those that are born into the World, to the end that at the last day, he may give to every one the same bones which he had upon Earth, so that he who in this life shall be so ill advised as not to honour him, nor present him with something will be but in an ill case; For he will give him some of the rottenest bones he can meet withall, and one or two less than he should have, by means whereof he will become deformed, lame and crooked; The Globe he holdeth in his hands is to fling at the head of the Gluttonous Serpent that liveth in the profound Abyss of the house of smoke, when he shall come thither to steal away any of those bones.</HI> He told us moreover, <HI>That it was threescore and fourteen Thousand years since he was begotten on a Tortoise, called</HI> Migoma, <HI>by a Sea-horse that was an hundred and thirty fathom long, who had been formerly King of the Giants of</HI> Fanius. He also assured us, <HI>That the Gifts which were presented to this Idol amounted to a vast sum of Money in a year, besides other Revenues which was as much more;</HI> He added, <HI>That this Idol had ordinarily Twelve Thousand Priests attending on his Service, maintained with all ne∣cessaries only to pray for the Dead unto whom these bones be∣longed, who also had allowed them without the Temple six hundred Servants, who took care, for providing all con∣veniencies for them; As for the Priests themselves, they never went without the limits of the Temple but by permissi∣on of their Superiors.</HI> There was also a <HI>Seraglio</HI> where∣in many Women appointed for that purpose were shut up, whom their Governesses permitted to have too near an Acquaintance with the Priests of this beastly and Diabolical Sect; <HI>Pinto's Travels, ch.</HI> 41.</P>
<P>And thus will I conclude the ridiculous and Ido∣latrous ways of Worship among the Heathens in these dark parts of the World.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Many strange Events have happened by the Ingenious Stratagems of some men, as we find in divers Authors; Sir <HI>Walver Rawleigh</HI> writes, That the Island of <HI>Sark</HI> joining to <HI>Guernsey,</HI> and belonging to
<PB N="86" REF="46"/>
that Government, was surprized by the <HI>French,</HI> and could never have been recovered again by strong hand, having Corn and Cattle enough upon the place to feed so many as would serve to defend it, and be∣ing every way so inaccessible as it might have held out against the <HI>Great Turk;</HI> Yet in the Reign of Q. <HI>Mary</HI> by the Industry of a Gentleman of the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI> it was in this manner regained; He Anchored in the Road with one ship of small burden, and pre∣tending the death of his Merchant besought the <HI>French,</HI> (being about thirty in number) that they might bury their Merchant in hallowed ground, and in the Chappel of that Isle; offering the <HI>French</HI> a Present of such Commodities as they had aboard; whereunto the <HI>French</HI> yeilded, upon Condition that they should not come ashore with any weapon, no not so much as a Knife; Then did the <HI>Flemings</HI> put a Coffin into their Boat, not filled with a dead Car∣cass, but with Swords, Targets, and Carabines; The <HI>French</HI> receiving them at their Landing, and search∣ing every one so narrowly that they could not hide a Pen-knife, gave them leave to draw their Coffin up the Rocks with great difficulty; some of the <HI>French</HI> took the <HI>Flemish</HI> Boat, and rowed toward the Ship to fetch the Rewards promised them, and what else they pleased, but being come aboard, they were taken and bound. The <HI>Flemmings</HI> on Land when they had carried their Coffin into the Chappel shut the door to them, and taking their weapons out of the Coffin set upon the <HI>French,</HI> who ran to the Cliff, and called to their Company Aboard the Ship to come to their assistance, but finding the Boat came back full of <HI>Flemmings,</HI> they yeilded themselves and the place. <HI>Rawleigh's History of the World, lib.</HI> 5.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. Notable was the exploit of the surpriz∣ing <HI>Breda</HI> in the Wars of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> A River called <HI>Merch</HI> runs by that City, upon which stands a Noble Castle rather for Habitation than Strength;
<PB N="87" REF="46"/>
Three Leagues from <HI>Breda,</HI> the River falls into a large Channel in <HI>Holland,</HI> and some Barks of Merchandise used to pass to and fro upon that River, having Pas∣ports for that purpose; The Governor of <HI>Breda</HI> un∣der the Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> used sometimes to go to a place about nine Miles off, and in his absence his Son commanded in his stead; All the while the Fa∣ther kept in <HI>Breda,</HI> he still caused diligent search to be made in every Boat that passed, lest by some trick or other he might be surprized, but his Son being young and inexperienced was neither so con∣siderate nor careful as he should have been. Among other Boats which passed to and fro, some carried Turf, which instead of Wood is much used for fir∣ing in <HI>Friesland, Holland,</HI> and the lower Parts of <HI>Flanders,</HI> who coming from <HI>Holland</HI> into the River <HI>Merch,</HI> went to <HI>Breda,</HI> and some other Towns there∣about, At this time there was a Mariner, a Master of a Boat, who was well acquainted with the Soul∣diers that kept the Castle by which all these Boats used to pass, who went to Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and told him, <HI>That a considerable company of Souldiers might be hid under the Turf in his boat, and that he might thereby very probably surprise the Castle by night, and afterward with a supply of Souldiers might easily enter</HI> Breda. Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> liked the Stratagem very well, and resolved to make Trial of it. These Turf-boats are usually of a good length, thereby to supply their want of breadth, the lesser Rivers and Channels not being capable of Broader, The Boat being fitted, the Ma∣ster came with it to <HI>Breda,</HI> and underneath the Turf which was upheld by great Poles, were placed four∣score Souldiers all choice men, and Captain <HI>Charles Harawger</HI> an old and Valiant Souldier commanded them; The Bark being come into the Castle, the young Governour gave Order that it should be sear∣ched according to Custom, but as that order was carelesly given, so it was carelesly executed; The Marriners hereby encouraged, passed from more se∣rious
<PB N="88" REF="47"/>
affairs to Sport and Jollity, and so delay'd the time till night came on, and invited those Souldiers which came to search the Boat to drink some Wine with them, and when they were well warmed with Wine, they soon fell asleep; The rest of the Soul∣diers were withdrawn into the Castle to take their rest; But on a sudden the Souldiers under the Turf Landed, and assaulted them on every side, being at first very much astonished, but were soon made sensible of the Surprizal, and as suddenly left the Castle to these New Guests; Some of them were hurt and some slain, and the young Governour was taken Prisoner; The Captains in the City were in so great Confusion that they could neither break down the Bridge whereby the Castle was joined to the Town, neither did they secure any one Gate of the City for some few hours, till succours could have come from the Neighbouring Garrison. In the mean time Count <HI>Hollack,</HI> and soon after Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> himself came, at whose entrance the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison marched basely and shamefully out, and left the City to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in 1590. <HI>Bentivolio's History of Flanders, pag.</HI> 264.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. <HI>Plutarch</HI> relates, That <HI>Hannibal</HI> the Ge∣neral of <HI>Carthage</HI> intending to remove his Forces to <HI>Cassinas;</HI> his Guides by a mistake of the <HI>Punick</HI> Tongue, led his Army to <HI>Cassilinum</HI> in <HI>Campania,</HI> which is very Mountainous, save a long Valley which stretches it self out into the Sea; <HI>Fabius</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> General had shut up the way by which he should get out with Four Thousand Souldiers, and the rest of his Army he had securely placed upon the Moun∣tains, or with a part of them troubled the Reer of his Enemy; Here <HI>Hannibal</HI> found himself in a Trap, and his Army was dejected with fear, apprehending an Impossibility of freeing themselves out of these Streights. <HI>Hannibal</HI> therefore causes two Thousand Oxen of his Prey, that he drove along with him to be caught, and fastens to each of their Horns Torches,
<PB N="89" REF="47"/>
and Faggots of dry sticks; These being lighted, he caused the Oxen to be driven up to the top of the Mountains, and in the mean time with the main of his Army, silently and in the dark, Marches to the outlet of the Valley; The Oxen marched in order till the Fire about their Horns got to the quick, and then they ran up and down as mad, their Fronts and Tails blazing and firing the Bushes as they went; The <HI>Romans</HI> amazed at this unwonted and terrible Spectacle, supposing that they were on all sides shut in by the Enemy, quitted their Post, and thereby gave free Liberty for <HI>Hannibal</HI> to March through the narrow Passage. <HI>Fabius</HI> not knowing whereto this Subtilty of the Enemy tended, kept himself within his Camp in good Order, but by the first light in the Morning it was easily discerned that by this Stratagem <HI>Hannibal</HI> had made his escape. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Fab. p.</HI> 178.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. <HI>Fernando Camero</HI> Governor of <HI>Dourlans</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> for the <HI>Spaniand</HI> 1596, being advertised that the Citizens of <HI>Amiens,</HI> a proud People and little practiced in Arms, would not receive the Garrison that the King offered them for the preservation of he Town, was resolved to do it by Policy, having also Intelligence with some within the Town, and there∣upon attires 40 or 50 stout Souldiers like Countrey Peasants loaden with many burdens, and armed under∣neath with Daggers and short pieces; and Marching with about 700 Horse and 5000 Foot, he lays several Souldiers in Ambush near the Town, and the next day sends some of his disguised Souldiers to one of the City Gates following a Cart, which being under the Portcullis, one of the pretended Peasants cut the Horse∣trace, which disorder'd the Horses and stopt the Gate; Upon which the others presently discover their Arms, sieze upon their <HI>Corps de Guard,</HI> and give a sign to those that lay in Ambush, who being both Horse and Foot, immediately enter the Town, go directly to the Market-place, take the Fort and sieze upon the Armory and Ammunition which King <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th.

<P N="35">XXXV. Remarkable have been the escapes of some men from Death, and the Grave, of which I shall give some Instances. <HI>Aristomenes</HI> General of the <HI>Mes∣senians</HI> had with too much courage adventured to set upon both the Kings of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and being in that fight wounded and fallen on the ground, was taken up senseless, and carried away with fifty of his Com∣panions; There was a deep natural Cave into which the <HI>Spartans</HI> used to cast headlong such as were con∣demned for the greatest Offences; To this Punish∣ment were <HI>Aristomenes</HI> and his Companions adjudged; All the rest of these poor men dyed with their falls; <HI>Aristomenes,</HI> howsoever it came to pass, took no harm yet it was harm enough to be imprisoned in a deep dark Dungeon among dead Carcasses, where he was likely to perish with hunger and stench; But a while after, he perceived by some small Glimmering of Light (which perhaps came in at the top) a Fox that was gnawing upon a dead body, hereupon he be∣thought himself that this Beast must needs know some way to enter the place and get out; for which cause he made shift to lay hold upon it, and catching it by the Tail with one hand, saved himself from biting with the other hand by thrusting his Coat into the mouth of it, so letting it creep whether it would he followed it, holding it as his Guide till the way was too streight for him, and then dismissed it. The Fox being let loose ran through an hole at which came a little Light, and there did <HI>Aristomenes</HI> dig so long with his Nails, that at last he clawed out his Passage, and so got home in safety, and afterwards became very famous and renowned as both the <HI>Co∣rinthians</HI> and <HI>Spartans,</HI> afterward found to their cost. <HI>Heylin's Cosmog. pag.</HI> 580.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. In the year 1357, There was a great Plague at <HI>Colen</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> amongst many others who
<PB N="91" REF="48"/>
were infected with it, was a Noble Lady, her name was <HI>Reichmut Adolch,</HI> she lived in the New-Market where her house is yet to be seen, she being supposed to dye of it, was accordingly buried; The Sextons knew that she was buried with a Ring upon her Finger, and therefore the night following they came privately to the Grave, and digged up the Coffin and opened it; Upon which the buried Lady raised up her self, the Sextons ran away in a terrible Fright, and left their Lanthorn behind them, which she took up, and made hast to the house of her Husband, by whom she was known and received in; Afterwards being attended with all care and diligence she perfectly recovered, and lived to have three Sons by her husband, all whom she devoted to the Mini∣stry; The Truth of all is confirmed by a publick Monumental Inscription, erected in Memory of so strange a thing, and is yet to be seen in the entrance of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Church in that City. <HI>Wanly's Hist.

<P N="37">XXXVII. I cannot but contemplate, saith. <HI>N. Cau∣sin,</HI> upon that Prodigy so loudly proclaimed by the <HI>Greek</HI> Historians; There was a Father and a Son in a certain Ship, which as it fortuned Split upon the Rocks; The Fathers Age not able to grapple with the Waves, was soon overwhelm'd and drowned; The Son labouring to save his Life, saw a Carcass floating upon the Water, and mistrusting his own Strength, mounted himself upon it, and by this help reached the shore in safety, He was no sooner free of his danger, but he knew the Corps to be that of his dead Father, who gave him life by his death, as he had afforded him birth by his Life.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. I read in the Relations of <HI>Muscovia</HI> (saith the same <HI>N.

<PB N="92" REF="49"/>
He had lived two dayes upon Honey only, and find∣ing that his Voice was not heard in that solitary Wood, he despaired of freeing himself from his Li∣quorish Captivity; but he was saved by a strange chance: A huge Bear came to the same Tree to eat of the Honey, whereof these Beasts are very greedy, he descended into the Tree, as a Man would do with his hinder parts forward; which being observed by the poor forlorn Creature, he desperately catcht hold of his Loins the Bear in a lamentable fright la∣boured with all his power to get out, and thereby drew out the Peasant from his sweet Prison, which otherwise had proved his Tomb. <HI>Causin's Holy Court.

<P N="39">XXXIX. Dr. <HI>Fuller,</HI> in his Worthies gives 3 no∣table instances of this kind; First, Sr. <HI>Richard Edg∣comb</HI> being zealous in the cause of <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Rich∣mond,</HI> (afterward King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh) was in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, so hotly persued, and narrowly searched for, that he was forced to hide himself in the thick woods, at his House at <HI>Cuttail</HI> in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> Here extremity taught him a sudden Policy, which was to put a stone in his Cap, and tumbled the same into the water, while these Persuers were fast at his heels, who looking down after the noise, and see∣ing his Cap swimming thereon, supposed that he had desperately drowned himself, and deluded by this honest fraud, gave over their farther persuit, leaving him at liberty to escape over into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P N="40">XL. A Second is of one <HI>John Thornborough,</HI> prefer∣red by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to be Dean of <HI>York,</HI> and Bi∣shop of <HI>Lymerick</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he received a most remarkable deliverance in manner following; Lodg∣ing in an Old Castle in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in a large room parti∣tioned but with Sheets or Curtains, with his Wife, Children, and Servants, in effect a whole Family; These all lying upon the ground on Matts, or such like; in the dead time of the night, the Floor over head being Earth and Plaister, (as in many places is

<P N="41">XLI. A Third Relation is concerning Sir <HI>Richard Edgcomb,</HI> who fighting valiantly for the King at <HI>Edg∣hil</HI> Battle, received twenty six wounds, and was left on the ground among the dead; Next day his Son <HI>Adrian Scroop</HI> obtained leave of the King to find, and fetch off his Fathers Corps, and his hopes pre∣tended no higher than a decent interment thereof; Such a search was thought in vain amongst many na∣ked bodies with wounds, disguised from themselves, and where pale death had confounded all Complexi∣ons together; However he having some general no∣tice of the place where his Father fell, did meet with his Body, that had some heat left therein, which with rubbing, within a few Minutes increased to mo∣tion, that motion within some few hours into sense; that sense within a day into speech, that speech with∣in certain weeks into a perfect recovery, living more than Ten Years after, a Monument of God's Mercy, and his Sons Affection; The Effect of this story I re∣ceived from his own mouth in <HI>Lincoln Colledge.

in upon him to Thirty five Foot depth; He was some∣what sensible before of what was coming, and oppo∣sed a plank, which by chance he had with him, against the Ruines, himself lying under it; By this means he was protected from the huge weight of Earth, and retained some room and breath to himself, by which he lived seven dayes and nights without food or sleep, supporting his Stomach only with his own Urine, without any pain or sorrow, being full of hope which he placed in God only; Ever and anon he called for help, as being yet safe, but was heard by none, though he could hear the motion, noise and words of those that were above him, and could count the hours as the Clock went. After the seventh day, he being all this while given for dead, they brought a Bier for his Corps, and when a good part of the Well was digged up, on a sudden they heard the voice of one crying from the bottom; At first they were afraid, as if it had been the voice of a Subterranean Spirit, the voice continuing they had some hope of his life, and hastened to dig to him, till at last, after they had given him a glass of Wine, they drew him up, living, and well, his strength so entire, that to lift him out he would not suffer himself to be bound, nor would use any help of another; Yea, he was of so sound Understanding, that jesting, he drew out his Purse, and gave them Money, saying, <HI>He had been with such good Hosts, that for seven dayes it had not cost him a far∣thing.</HI> Soon after he returned to his work again, and was then alive when I writ this, saith <HI>Bartholomew Au∣mulus.</HI> Thus we see many have been providentially saved from death by very strange wayes and means; And we likewise read that others have been as happi∣ly cured of very dangerous Diseases by very strange Accidents, of which the following Relations give an account.</P>

This Spectacle moved the almost dy∣ing Cardinal to an extream laughter, the laughter broke the Impostume, and after he had well vomited, he was restored to his health, and to the recovery of his imbezelled Goods. <HI>Wanly's Hist.

<P N="51">LI. In the year 1602. saith the famous <HI>Crollius,</HI> I saw at <HI>Prague</HI> a <HI>Bohemian</HI> Countrey Fellow named <HI>Matthew</HI> aged about 36 years; this man for 2 years together, with a strange and unheard of Dexterity in his Throat, used often in Company of such as sate drinking to take a knife af the usual bigness, with a haft of Horn, and this after the manner of a Jugler, he would put down his Throat and drink a good draught of Ale after it, which was given him for his pains; But he could recover it at his pleasure, and with a singular Art take it by the point and draw it out; But by I know not what misfortune the day af∣ter <HI>Easter</HI> the same year, he swallowed the same knife so far that it went down into his very Stomach, and by no Artifice of his could be drawn back any more; He was half dead through the apprehension of death that would undoubtedly follow, but after he had retained the knife in manner aforesaid for the space of seven weeks and two days entire, by the use and means of

Attractive Plaisters made up with Loadstone and o∣ther things, the knife point by a natural impulse be∣gan to make its way out near the Orifice of the Sto∣mach, which the Patient perceiving, though by many perswaded to the contrary, because of the imminent hazard of his Life, was very earnest that incision might be made, and so the knife drawn out, which he at length obtained to be done by many intreaties, and upon <HI>Thursday</HI> after <HI>Whitsontide</HI> about seven a Clock in the Morning all was happily performed by <HI>Florianus Mathis</HI> of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> the chief Chirurgeon both of the City and Kingdom, The Knife is laid up amongst the Emperors Rarities, and shewed as an incredible miracle by the Courtiers and others in the City; the length of this Knife is nine Inches, and the colour of it was so changed as if it had all that time lain in the Fire; The Countrey Fellow in some few weeks by the care of his expert Chirurgion, without any further Sickness or Trouble, and contrary to the Judgment of Physitians recovered his former health so perfectly that soon after he married, and lived many years. <HI>Crollius Chymistry, pag.</HI> 125.</P>
<P N="52">LII. This mans Recovery was very admirable, but that which follows seems yet more strange, being much more likely to kill than cure, as having been the occasion of many a mans Death, but however since a credible Author reports it, I shall do the same. <HI>Paleologus</HI> the Second, Emperor of <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI> was dangerously sick, and when Nature, nor the Art of his Physitians could any way help him, and that he had kept his Bed for a whole year, to the great prejudice of the State; His Empress was in∣formed by an old Woman, that it was impossible her husband should recover, unless he was continually vexed and provoked by her harsh dealing and ill usage, for by that means the humors that were the occasion of his sickness, would be dissipated and dis∣charged; This advice was approved, and by this way of contrary cure as one would think, the Empress
<PB N="101" REF="53"/>
proceeded; For she began continually to vex and torment him to an exceeding height, scarce observing him in any one thing that he commanded; with these frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and incessant vexations, the malignant Hu∣mors were dispersed by the Augmentation of heat, and the Emperor did so perfectly recover, that throughout those twenty years in which he afterward lived, even to the sixtieth year of his Age, he re∣mained sound and well. <HI>Camerarius's Spare Hours, Cent.</HI> 3.</P>

<P N="54">LIV. Sir <HI>John Cheek</HI> was once one of the Tutors to King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th. and afterwards Secretary of State, much did the Kingdom value him, but more the King, for being once desperately sick, the King carefully enquiring of him every day, at last his Phy∣sitian told him, there was no hope of his Life, being given over by him for a dead man; <HI>No,</HI> said the King, <HI>He will not dye this time, for this morning I begged his life from God in my prayers, and obtained it;</HI> which accordingly came to pass, and he soon after contrary to all expectation wonderfully recovered.

<P N="56">LVI. And as by these Examples we may observe how strangely some Persons have been saved from death, so we find others have unwarily and unwit∣tingly procured and hastened their own death and downfall; For we read in <HI>Josephus</HI> that <HI>Anthony</HI> being at <HI>Laodicea</HI> sent for King <HI>Herod</HI> to answer what was objected against him touching the death of young <HI>A∣ristobulus; Herod</HI> was an impotent Lover of his Wife <HI>Mariamne,</HI> and suspecting that her Beauty was one cause of his danger, before he went he committed the care of his Kingdom to <HI>Joseph</HI> his Uncle, withal leaving him order to kill <HI>Mariamne</HI> his Wife in case he should hear that any thing evil had befallen him; <HI>Herod</HI> took his Journey and <HI>Joseph</HI> in Conversation with the Queen acquainted her with the Order he had left with him. <HI>Herod</HI> having appeased <HI>Anthony,</HI> returned with Honour, and speaking to the Queen of the Truth and Greatness of his Love, in the midst of Embraces, <HI>Mariamne</HI> said to him, <HI>It was not the part of a Lover
<PB N="103" REF="54"/>
to give Commandement that if any thing should befall thee otherwise than well with</HI> Anthony, <HI>I should presently be put to death.</HI> No sooner were these words out of her mouth, but the King entred into a strange Passion, and giving over his Embraces, he cryed out with a loud Voice, and tore his hair, saying, <HI>That he had a most evident proof that</HI> Joseph <HI>had committed adultery with her, because he would not have discovered those things which had been spoken to him in secret, except they had greatly trusted each other.</HI> And in this emotion or rage of Jea∣lousie he hardly contained from killing his Wife; yet he gave Order that <HI>Joseph</HI> should be slain, without admitting him Audience or Justification of his Inno∣cence.

Notwithstanding upon a tender compassion he was sometime in deliberation with himself, and mind∣ed to call <HI>Posthumius</HI> from Banishment; <HI>Fulvius</HI> I say being privy to these means, and designs of his, went home and told his Wife all that he had heard; She could not hold, but went presently to the Empress <HI>Livia,</HI> Wife to <HI>Augustus,</HI> and reported what her Hus∣band <HI>Fulvius</HI> had told her; Whereupon <HI>Livia</HI> in great Indignation did sharply expostulate with <HI>Caesar</HI> in these Terms; <HI>Seeing</HI> said she, <HI>you had so long project∣ed such a thing as to call home your Nephew, why did you not send for him at first, but have exposed me to the hatred and enmity of</HI> Posthumius, <HI>who shall be Emperour after your Decease;</HI> The next morning betimes, when <HI>Ful∣vius</HI> came as his manner was to salute <HI>Caesar,</HI> and bid him <HI>good morrow,</HI> after he had said, <HI>God save you</HI> Cae∣sar, <HI>Augustus</HI> resaluted him with this, <HI>God make you wise</HI> Fulvius; <HI>Fulvius</HI> soon found him, and conceiv∣ed presently what he meant thereby; He retired then to his house with all speed, and having called his wife, <HI>Caesar</HI> said he, <HI>is come to the knowledge that I have not con∣cealed this secret, and therefore I am resolved to make away my self with my own hands; And well worthy,</HI> (quoth

<P N="66">LXVI. Strange was the destiny, or rather the Di∣vine Vengeance which fell on the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> a cruel Persecutor of the poor <HI>French</HI> Protestants, and a bloody instrument in the Massacre of <HI>Paris;</HI> For Advertisements came from all parts, both within and without the Realm, from <HI>Spain, Rome, Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> to give notice to this <HI>Henry of Lorrain</HI> Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third of <HI>France,</HI> that a bloody <HI>Catastrophe</HI> would dissolve that Assem∣bly he had then occasioned of the Estates; The Al∣manacks, had well observed it; It was generally re∣ported in the Estates that the Exececution should be on St. <HI>Thomas</HI> his day, the very Evening before the Dukes death, the Duke himself sitting down to din∣ner, found a scrole under his Napkin, Advertising him of a secret design of the King, and his Party against him, but he writ underneath with his own hand, <HI>they dare not,</HI> and threw it under the Table; seeing therefore that no warning would abate his con∣fidence, nor awake his security; This Murder was performed on this manner; Upon <HI>December</HI> 23. 1588.

<HI>Larchant</HI> the Captain of the Kings Guards, staid the Page that carryed it, and caused another Handker∣chief to be given him by St. <HI>Prix</HI> the Chief Groom of the Kings Chamber; The Spirit of man doth of∣ten Prophesie the mischief that doth persue him; The Duke in the Council complains of strange altera∣tions, and extraordinary distemperatures, and amidst his distrust a great fainting of his heart, St. <HI>Prix</HI> pre∣sents unto him some Prunes of <HI>Brignolles,</HI> he eats, and thereupon the King calls him into his Cabinet by <HI>Re∣vol</HI> one of his Secretaries of State, as if to confer with him about some secret of importance; The Duke leaves the Council to pass into the Cabinet, and as he lift up the Tapestry with one hand to enter, no less than forty five persons waited with Ponyards, Rapiers, and Partisans to dispatch him, and so he was there slain. <HI>Hist.

But though this was an honest error of <HI>Fabius,</HI> yet he was severely reprehended by the Con∣suls for it, since they would not that Privacy, which is the best and safest bond in the Administration of Affairs, should be broke; Therefore when <HI>Eumenes</HI> King of <HI>Asia,</HI> a Friend to <HI>Rome,</HI> had declared to the Senate, that <HI>Perseus</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> was preparing to War upon the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> it could never be

Translated from the <HI>Italian</HI> by <HI>James Howel</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and thus contracted by Mr. <HI>Samuel Clark.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Arcos</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Na∣ples</HI> under the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having imposed many Gabels or Taxes upon several Commodities both vendible and edible, at last laid a Tax upon Fruit also, which more provoked and offended the Multi∣tude than all the former, whereupon by their publick Cries and Lamentations they daily sollicited the Vice-Roy as he passed through the Market-place to ease them of that Burden, using likewise the mediation of others, which not prevailing, they were ready to raise a Mutiny, which so affrighted the Vice-Roy, that he promised quite to take off the Gabel, but de∣laying to do it, some of the enraged People one night put fire to some Powder in the Market-place where it was exacted, and blew it up; There were also dayly bitter invectives and protests against the publick Officers fixed in divers parts of the City; At which the Vice-Roy being Alarum'd, often Assembled the six Precincts of the City to consult about the business, some being for, and others against easing the People, saying, <HI>They were but a Company of Tatterdemalions who made all this noise;</HI> Besides divers Great Men and Mer∣chants of the City had advanced upon this Gabel above six hundred Thousand Crowns, and were to pay eighty five Thousand Crowns of Annual Rent; This was noised abroad, and likewise that if this were taken off another Tax would be set upon Corn and Wine, whereupon the enraged People protested they would never endure it; While these discontents were hot, <HI>July</HI> 7. 1647.

on his head, happened to be in the Market-place; His Employment was to Angle for little Fishes, and also to buy Fish and carry them about to sell, he was vulgarly called <HI>Massanello,</HI> and being naturally Crafty, he observed the general Murmurings of the People, and so went up and down to the Fruiterers Shops, and advised them, that meeting together the next day in the Market-place, they should tell the Countrey Fruiterers that they should buy no more Gabelled or Taxed fruit; Accordingly next day they refused to buy, but one of the City Officers perswaded them to buy it for the present and promised that the Gabel should be suddenly taken off, and so prevailed with them for that time; <HI>Massanello</HI> seeing his expectation fru∣strated, went up and down crying; <HI>Avant Gabel, Down with the Gabel,</HI> for which some jeered him, others con∣sidered well of his Words, About the same time ma∣ny Boys being met in the Market-place, he bid them say as he said, and do as he did, and then taught them to cry, <HI>Let God live, &amp;c. Let the Pope live; Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live, and let the ill Government dye.</HI> This the Boyes cryed up and down, which caused much Laughter and Jeering at their Master, as if he were Mad, or a Fool; But he told them, <HI>You laugh at me now, but you shall shortly see what</HI> Massanello <HI>can do; Let me alone, and if I do not free you from all your Slaveries, let me be held infamous for ever;</HI> Which words increased their Laughter the more; But he minding his business, listed about Two Thousand Boys about sixteen or seventeen years old, whom he prepared against a great Festival that was approaching; giving every one of them a little Cane in his hand.</P>
<P>The day being come upon which a Feast used to be made by the Boys, and meaner sort of People in the Market-place, they erected a Castle of Wood, which they battered with Sticks and Fruit, which drew a great Concourse of People together, and at the same time a Quarrel began between the Shop-keepers and Fruiterers, the former refusing to buy
<PB N="115" REF="60"/>
their Fruit; Whereupon a Chief Officer came to still the Commotion, and the better to quiet the Citi∣zens, he reviled the Countrey Fruiterers, threatning to <HI>Bastinado</HI> them, and to send them to the Gallies; Amongst these was a Cosen of <HI>Massanello's,</HI> who ac∣cording to the Instructions given him, threw his Bas∣kets of Fruit upon the ground, crying out, <HI>God gives Plenty and the ill Government gives a Dearth, I care not a straw for my fruit, let every one take of it;</HI> Whereupon the Boys eagerly gathered it, and <HI>Massanello</HI> cried out, <HI>Without Gabel, without Gabel.</HI> So that the Of∣ficer threatned him with whipping and the Gallies, at which the People threw Figs, Apples, and other Fruit with Fury into the Officers Face; But <HI>Massa∣nello</HI> hit him on the Breast with a Stone, encouraging his <HI>Militia</HI> of Boys to do the like; so that if the Offi∣cer had not speedily broken through with his Coach, and got away to the Palace, he had been torn in pieces or stoned to death. Upon this success the number of the People still increasing they exclaimed aloud against their oppressions, protesting not to pay any more Gabels, crying out, <HI>Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live, and let the ill Government die. Massanello</HI> being thus attended with his Boys, and an infinite Com∣pany of loose People, who were now armed with Pikes and Partizans. he leaped upon a Table and with a loud voice cryed; <HI>Be joyful my Dear Companions, give God Thanks that the hour of your Redemption draws near; This poor barefooted Fellow as another</HI> Moses <HI>who freed the</HI> Israelites <HI>from</HI> Pharaoh's <HI>Rod, shall Redeem you from all Gabels and Taxes.</HI> Peter <HI>a Fisherman with his voice re∣deemed</HI> Rome; <HI>and with it a world from Satans Slavery to the Liberty of Christ. Now another Fisherman which is</HI> Massanello, <HI>shall release</HI> Naples, <HI>and with it a whole Kingdom from the Tyranny of Gabels,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Nor to effect this do I care a rush to be torn in peices, nor to be dragged up and down the kennels of</HI> Naples; <HI>Let all the bloud of my body spin out of these veins; Let my head skip from my Shoulders by a fatal Steel, and be set up in the Market-place
<PB N="116" REF="61"/>
on Pole, yet I shall dye contentedly and gloriously; It will be honour enough to me to think that my bloud and life perish in so glorious a Cause;</HI> With these and such like Words he so enflam'd the People, that they were willing to joyn with him, and to begin the work, they fired the House next to the Tole-house for Fruit, which was burnt down with all the Books of Accounts and other Goods in it.</P>
<P>This being done, the number so increased that eve∣ry one shut up his Shop, being astonished at so sud∣den a Tumult, who burnt down other Gabel-houses for all other Goods with their Books and Writings; wherein it was very observable, that in plundering those Houses wherein were such quantities of Money and rich Furniture, not one durst meddle with the least piece of any thing, but all was consumed in the Flames, being as they said, <HI>The Quintessence of their bloud.</HI> The People meeting with no opposition, were encouraged and encreased thereby; so that above Ten Thousand made toward the Palace of the Vice-Roy, carrying Loaves of Bread upon their Pikes and cry∣ing, <HI>Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live, and the ill Government die;</HI> and <HI>Massanello</HI> and his Boys with doleful and loud voices as they went along the Streets laboured to move all the People to joyn with them, and going to St. <HI>James's</HI> Prison, they freed all the Prisoners, and admitted them into their Society; when they came to the Palace, they cried out; <HI>That they would not only be freed from the Gabel upon Fruits, but from all other Ga∣bels also;</HI> whereupon the Vice-Roy coming out into a Balcony, told them, <HI>That the Gabel should be abolished, and part of that upon Corn also.</HI> But they still cried out, <HI>That they would not be releived in part, they would have the whole taken off;</HI> adding, <HI>May the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live, and the ill Government dye;</HI> Many of them attempting to go up the Stairs to acquaint the Governour with the rest of their Grievances, they were kept back by the Guard of Souldiers; But with their Canes, Clubs, a great Cry, they forced their Passage, and demanded
<PB N="117" REF="61"/>
Audience of the Vice-Roy, but he had withdrawn himself. So that when they came to the Hall-door, and found it shut, they broke it open, and at his Chamber they met with some further resistance by Souldiers, but forcing them away, they had easie ac∣cess into all other rooms, even to the very Closet where the Vice-Roy had hid himself, and though it was double bolted, yet by main force they broke it open, where he had certainly lost his life, but that two Noblemen with much ado, conveyed him away; Then he intended to have gone into the Castle, whither his Lady and Children had retired, but un∣derstanding that the Draw-Bridge was up, he took Sanctuary in a Church and Friery, and so out of a Window gave the People notice that he was willing to content them, and accordingly publisht divers Schedules for taking off the Gabel from Fruit, and part of that from Corn, yet were they not satisfied, but made signs for him to come down, and speak with them Face to Face, which he did accordingly in a Coach, but they upon pain of Death commanded him out, and some then said, <HI>Sir, for the Love of God disburthen us at once of these Gabels, Let us have no more Slavery, Let us breathe;</HI> Then did the Vice-Roy grant their Request, yet thinking himself unsafe, he threw some pieces of Gold among them, which whilst they were scrambling for, he got into a Church, and for∣tified the passages both of that and the Monastery.</P>
<P>The People furiously followed him, and though at a Window he promised them satisfaction, yet they had proceeded farther had not the Archbishop inter∣posed, and obtained an Instrument under the hand and Seal of the Vice-Roy, which he shewed to the People, and so drawing him after them along the Streets, he at last with a loud voice read the Instru∣ment to them; But when it was read, they all cried out, <HI>That they were cheated, since it only contained the taking off the Gabel of Fruit, and part of that upon wheat;</HI> and it was thereupon resolved, <HI>That it was necessary for
<PB N="118" REF="62"/>
the Defence of the Faithful People of</HI> Naples <HI>to enrol some Armed men to procure a Total discharge of Gabels.</HI> They then disarmed all the Guards, and desired, yea beseeched the Prince of <HI>Basignano,</HI> Collonel General of the Bat∣talions of <HI>Naples</HI> who was well beloved amongst them, to be their Defender and Intercessor to the Vice-Roy for the Total Abolishment of Gabels; This Request he could not refuse, and therefore mounting on Horseback, he went along with them, the number of Men and Boys still encreasing till they were about fifty Thousand; The Prince used all possible means to quiet the People, swearing, <HI>That he would obtain for them what they desired;</HI> yet he prevailed nothing, for some of them ran to divers Prisons, breaking them open, freeing the Prisoners, and burning all the Books, and Processes of Prisoners that were found in the Of∣fices; Then going to the Toll-houses for Corn, they burnt it quite down, together with much Corn, Houshold-stuff and Money; Then they went to St. <HI>Lawrence</HI>'s Church to ring the great Bell to warn all the people to Arm; but there they met with some Resistance; in which time the Prince being almost spent in the Crowd slipt away; which the People un∣derstanding, cried out to <HI>Massanello</HI> to be their Cap∣tain and Conductor, who accepting the Charge, by sound of Drum stirred up all the People of the City and Suburbs to take Arms.</P>
<P>The day now declining, to prevent the infinite mischief that was like to ensue, it was thought fit by some, that the Monks and Fryers should go in Pro∣cession through the City to implore the Divine help and if possible to quiet the People, which accordingly they did but without success; But the Vice-Roy and Nobility fearing the People should sieze upon 16 pieces of Ordnance, Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Ring the Bells to encrease the Uproar, they sent a good guard of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and others to prevent them; and about Mid-night the Vice Roy and other principal men re∣moved to the Castle <HI>Nuovo,</HI> that was near the Palace,
<PB N="119" REF="62"/>
and the better to quiet the People, he published good Orders concerning bread, which being scarce 24 Ounces, should now be made above 33 Ounces, and that Considerable Guards should be set about the Ca∣stle; yet the People went on with their Fury, Ringing Bells, and dividing themselves into all Quarters; Some burning down the rest of the Toll-Houses; O∣thers plundering the Shops for Swords, Musquets, Bullets, Match, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And one foolish Man resisting them, they put Fire to his house wherein were divers Barrels of Powder, which taking Fire blew up 87 Men, besides 44 that were hurt; To prevent the like mischief the Vice-Roy commanded, that all the Powder in other places should be made wet with water.</P>
<P>The next day <HI>July</HI> 8. very early in the morning the People appeared in a warlike Equipage, amongst whom were mingled many Countrey Fellows with pitchforks, plowshares, shovels, and the like, and many Women with Fire-shovels, Tongs, Spits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yea the very Children with little Staves and Canes all in an enraged manner crying out; <HI>Let the Lord our King live, and the ill Government die;</HI> With such like cryes the Air w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s filled. They then sent order to the 36 Wards of the City to Arm immediately, upon pain of having their Houses burnt down. But want∣ing Powder, they went to a House where they knew some was, who refusing to sell it them, they threw lighted Matches into it, blowing up the House and sixty Persons that were in it; Then they hastned to the Kings Powderhouse that was out of the City, but when they came thither found it all put in Water, and so were disappointed; In the mean time the Vice-Roy had strengthened his Guards with a Thou∣sand <HI>Germans,</HI> eight hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and a Thou∣sand <HI>Italians,</HI> fortifying all places about him; He sent also for another Regiment of <HI>Germans</HI> from <HI>Poz∣zolo,</HI> which the People hearing of met them, slew some and took the rest Prisoners; That morning also
<PB N="120" REF="63"/>
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Guard had Imprisoned two mean fellows for some Insolencies, but the people set upon the Guard, slew some, and threatned to tear in pieces all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Naples,</HI> if they were not released, to prevent which they were set free; Then the Vice-Roy sent some Lords to <HI>Massanello</HI> with an instrument, wherein he granted as much as they desired the day before, that is, <HI>To take off all the Gabels,</HI> but this satis∣fied not the people, they would now have more, and all his Officers and Nobles should oblige themselves to restore all their priviledges granted by King <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI> and <HI>Frederick,</HI> and the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth and also that a Law should be enacted, <HI>That never any more Gabels should be imposed upon them;</HI> The Vice-Roy perceiving that they still grew upon him, sent amongst them the Lords that were most Popular, who told them <HI>That his Excellency was ready to give them all satis∣faction;</HI> The people answered, <HI>That by their forementi∣oned Priviledges, no New Tax was to be imposed without consent of the Pope, and if any were, that the City might defend their Liberties with the sword, without any mark of Rebellion against their Prince, and therefore they de∣manded the Original of those grants;</HI> With which an∣swer the Lords returned to the Vice-Roy; who imme∣diately summoned all the Councils to consider what return to make to them.</P>
<P>In the mean time New Processions were made by the Priests, and the Sacrament and Reliques were laid forth in the Churches to implore the Divine Assist∣ance in such an Exigency; Then came a Lord from the Castle, and brought a Copy of their Priviledges, assuring them that it agreed with the Original, this pleased them at first, but when it was read, it was found imperfect, whereupon the people raged ex∣ceedingly, saying, <HI>That they were mocked and betrayed, and that they would be revenged upon all the Nobility;</HI> and taking the Duke that brought it, they cast him into Prison, who hardly escaped, but by the interc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of <HI>Peronne,</HI> one of the Chiefs, who with a Priest cal∣led
<PB N="121" REF="63"/>
<HI>Julio Genovino,</HI> were joined in Assistance to <HI>Mas∣sanello;</HI> The first order they made, was to burn down the Houses of Sixty Persons who had been Projectors and Officers in the Custom-houses, and had inriched themselves by the blood of the people; This was per∣formed so strictly, that one for taking a little Towel out of those Houses was killed, another for a Horse-crouper had Fifty lashes on his back, and some others for small Trifles were hanged by the Command of <HI>Massanello,</HI> and he that pityed the burning of those mens Houses or Goods was held no friend to the peo∣ple, the houses were very stately, out of which they threw all sorts of Plate, Dishes, Stools, Tables, Chairs, Carpets, Tapestry, and abundance of Money, all which they carried into the Market place, and burn∣ed, crying out; <HI>These goods are our blood, and as these burn, so the Souls of those Dogs that own them deserve to burn in Hell-fire;</HI> In one of these Palaces, besides all sorts of rich Furniture, were brought out Twenty Three great Trunks, which were full of Rich Cloth of Gold, Tissue, costly Embroideries, that dazled the Eyes of the Beholders, a Cabinet of Pearls and Precious Stones, yet nothing was saved from the fire;</P>
<P>The Vice Roy being desirous to put an end to these Combustions and Burnings, sent a Printed Instrument for abolishing all Gabels with a General Pardon, which took no effect, because the pardon was not so full as they desired; but percieving that the Nobility in Ge∣neral were hated, he resolved to employ two Advo∣cates of the people, committing to their care and prudence the quieting of them, who told him no∣thing would quiet them, unless the Original Charter of Priviledges granted by <HI>Charles</HI> 5 were delivered to them, which he therefore ordered to be searcht out; In the mean time <HI>Massanello</HI> commanded all the Mer∣chants in the Name of the people to be ready in Arms for their service; And himself went with his Train to all the Houses of the Gentry, and others, to search

for Arms, taking all they found of all sorts, which were many Thousands, with Nine Pieces of Ordnance, Two Canons they took out of a Ship, and Seven more out of another; all which they planted at the mouths of Principal Streets; Thus ended the second day, the Sun scarce appearing on the third Morning, when the enraged People ran to the house of a Rich Farmer of the Gabel upon Corn; and it is incredible what a world of Goods, very precious both for quantity and quality, were found in his house, all which they burn∣ed to Ashes, only two Boxes of Gold were preserved and deposited in the King's Bank; Then went they to the Palace of the Duke of <HI>Caivano,</HI> who was Secre∣tary of the Kingdom, where they burned his Books, Writings and Library, with infinite store of Rich Moveables and Utensils, Coaches, Sedans, Couches, rare silver Vessels and Jewels of all kinds, store of Curious Pictures, all which were burned, save some that they sent to Churches as counting them holy pie∣ces, yet burned their Rich Frames; and harassed the house to the ground; The fire was so great that it took hold of a Neighbouring Monastery of Nuns, and burnt down a gallant Library; The like Desolations were made in all houses that <HI>Massanello</HI> appointed to destruction, which were many of the stateliest in all <HI>Naples;</HI> In one of them was found an inestimable Wardrobe, fit for a King, which was all destroyed; Others hid their Richest Moveables in Monasteries, which were by the command of <HI>Massanello</HI> brought out and burned.</P>
<P>Whilst the People were thus revenging themselves on their supposed Adversaries, by the diligence of those that were imployed, the Original Charters of their Priviledges were found out; which being carry∣ed to the Vice Roy, he immediately sent them word of it, promising all satisfaction, but they finding that delayes were made, demanded to be Masters of the Tower, where the great Bell hung to sound to war at any time, as also of a Port which they thought
<PB N="123" REF="64"/>
might be prejudicial to them, and to have the use of the Artillery, and Arms of the City therein, and be∣fore they could have an answer, Ten Thousand of them Besieged and Assaulted the Tower, forcing the Soul∣diers to depart, leaving all their Arms behind them; Then by the Command of <HI>Massanello,</HI> the great Bell was rung, and the Arms brought forth, yet with a Protestation, <HI>That they intended not to rebel, but only to secure the people;</HI> The Charter not yet appearing, the People grew so furious that they drew forth other goods to be burnt, amongst which they found the Pic∣tures of the then King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which they placed un∣der a Rich Canopy, crying aloud, <HI>Let God live, let our King live, and let the ill Government dye;</HI> Then they planted many pieces of Ordnance in all places, and set Guards, and amongst their Company marched many women in Warlike Equipage, like so many Amazons, and after them little Girls with battoons and sticks in their hands, and amongst all several <HI>Banditi</HI> or thieves mingled themselves, under a pretence to help the people, but indeed to inrich themselves by plunder, or plot some Treason.</P>
<P>During these stirs they kept all Provisions our of the Castle where the Vice-Roy was, and being Ma∣sters both of Sea and Land, they held him as it were Besieged; So that he at last delivered the Original Charter to the Archbishop, together with a Writing, wherein the Vice Roy promised firmly to observe it; With these he went to the Market place, not doubt∣ing but to give them satisfaction, and probably he had done it, but that at the same instant a Conspiracy was discovered for the cutting off <HI>Massanello,</HI> and when the Charter came to be read, they suspected it not to be real, whereupon the Archbishop was in danger of his Life, but he told <HI>Massanello</HI> it was the right, and one was appointed to examine it all night, which hap∣pened well for some, for otherwise thirty six stately Houses were appointed to have been burned down, but at the request of the Archbishop, <HI>Massanello</HI> pre∣served

them; Again, when the Instrument from the Vice Roy came to be read, wherein was this passage, <HI>That be pardoned the People for whatsoever they had done, promising to obtain such pardon from his Catholick Majesty for any Act of Rebellion that had happened,</HI> they were greatly moved, and cryed out; <HI>That they never com∣mitted any Act of Rebellion, but had alwayes been his most faithful Vassals, praying that he might live a Thousand years,</HI> And so thinking they were cheated and betrayed, they went on in forming their <HI>Militia,</HI> amongst whom marched the women in great numbers armed, some with Battoons on their necks, some with naked swords in their hands, others with swords, daggers, and knives, strutted about the Streets, and marching be∣fore the Palace Royal, having a man in the Front, and another in the Reer, still crying out; <HI>Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live, but the ill Government dye;</HI> These Commotions being reported abroad, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Soul∣diers quartered in the adjacent Villages, hastned to∣ward <HI>Naples,</HI> which the People hearing of, sent out parties who disarmed them, and turned them back, the like they did to Five Hundred <HI>Germans,</HI> who were coming from <HI>Caprea;</HI> And <HI>Massianello</HI> made an order, <HI>That all those Houses wherein were the Pictures of the King and Queen of</HI> Spain, <HI>should be thrown down, and the Arms of the most faithful people of</HI> Naples <HI>should be set up under Canopies;</HI> And truly it was a wonder that he should have so much regard and respect, as to be able to rule things at his pleasure in such a City, wherein were so many Doctors, Merchants, Notaries, Scrive∣ners, Proctors, Physicians, Lawyers, Souldiers, and worthy Artizans, with a multitude of others, who were men of Judgment, Wit, Wealth and Valour, the meanest of them far Superiour to him in condi∣tion; But from this third day, when he went from the people, to negotiate with the Archbishop, the Prelate remained astonished at his Spirit and Parts; whereupon the People made him Captain General of all their Forces, and he erecting a Scaffold in the

Market place, with two more that assisted him, gave publick Audience, recieving from all sorts, whether Laicks, or Ecclesiasticks, Petitions, Memorials; passing orders, decreeing Civil, Criminal, and Mi∣litary Sentences, and had at his command an Army of an Hundred and Fifty Thousand Men, besides Women and Boys, who were an incredible number, and thus ended the Third day, which was Tuesday.</P>
<P>The Fourth day early in the Morning, <HI>Massanello</HI> commanded his Life-guard, consisting of Seven or Eight Thousand men, to repair upon pain of death to the Palace of the Duke of <HI>Caivano,</HI> who was ac∣counted one of the Peoples greatest enemies, and again to plunder his house, notice being given of far richer goods than were before discovered; and ac∣cordingly when they had broken it open, they found two Chambers full of the richest Tapestry that could be seen, with much other costly goods, then they went into his Gardens, where they brake the Marble Statues, grubbed up the Trees, Flowers, &amp;c. and putting fire to several places, they burnt the house, and all down to the ground; From thence they went to the Palace of the young Duke his Son, to get the residue of his Fathers Goods, preserved happily by him, and rushing in, they miserably spoiled every thing; and to quicken them the Women and Boys brought Faggots, Pitch, Oyl and Straw, crying out, <HI>We have but this little Straw left in our Houses, and it shall serve to burn down the Kennels of these Dogs, who have imposed and exacted these cursed Taxes and Gabels from us, and thereby sucked out our blood;</HI> Other Women would bring their Children in their Arms, and put∣ting fired Matches into their hands, they would make them throw them into the fire, saying, <HI>These poor Lambs shall take vengeance on these Thieves, for the bread which they have taken out of their Mouths;</HI> Yea, some∣times they added, <HI>Let God live for ever, and our King, and let these Dogs dye the death;</HI> While the People thus vented their discontents, the Arch-Bishop had pre∣vailed
<PB N="126" REF="66"/>
with the Vice-Roy for a Pacification, and it was agreed, that the Vice-Roy and Nobles should come to the Church of <HI>Carmine,</HI> and there Treat with <HI>Massa∣nello,</HI> who consented to it, yet charged the People upon pain of Death to maintain their Station; The Vice-Roy in the mean time sent an Instrument, where∣in he confirmed all the Peoples Priviledges, which the Archbishop having recieved, He requested <HI>Massa∣nello</HI> to call together all the Captains of the People to hear it read; and there were great hopes of a final Conclusion, which yet again was interrupted by this Accident; <HI>Peronne</HI> who was <HI>Massanello</HI>'s Assistant, con∣spiring, with the Duke of <HI>Mataloni</HI> and his Brother, to destroy <HI>Massanello,</HI> hoping that then he might ea∣sily disperse the People, had sent five Hundred <HI>Ban∣diti,</HI> who just then entred at one of the Gates on Horseback, and being brought before <HI>Massanello,</HI> they pretended to come for the Service of the People; <HI>Massanello</HI> welcomed them, and ordered them to serve in several Places on Foot; But <HI>Peronne</HI> would have them keep altogether on Horseback, whereupon <HI>Massanello</HI> suspecting somewhat, commanded peremp∣torily, that they should be on Foot, and keep the place which he assigned them to; The <HI>Banditi</HI> being vexed at this, discharged seven Harquebuss Shot at him, but all missed him, though some of the Bullets burnt part of his Shirt, which was esteemed a Mira∣cle; The People being herewith inraged, fell upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Banditi,</HI> slew some, took others, and forced the rest to fly over the Walls for their safety; <HI>Peronne</HI> also was apprehended by <HI>Massanello</HI>'s Order, and fettered till he was brought to his Trial which was presently after the Tumult was over; He was first put to the Rack, where he confessed, <HI>That by the Instigation of the Duke of</HI> Mataloni <HI>he had sent for those</HI> Banditi, <HI>that</HI> Massa∣nello, <HI>should have been slain, That Mines were already made, and stored with Gunpowder to blow up many of the People,</HI> &amp;c. After which Confession his head and his brothers were cut off, and pitched upon Poles in the Market-place.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="66"/>One of the <HI>Banditi,</HI> that was taken, promised, <HI>That if his life might be spared he would make further Discoveries;</HI> which being granted, provided his discoveries prov∣ed True, He confessed, <HI>That if the</HI> Banditi <HI>had suc∣ceeded in their design, more Troops of Horse would have fol∣lowed, and that they were to have set Fire to some Mines under the Great Market-place at such time as there was the great∣est Confluence of People, for which end a great quantity of powder was spread up and down in several places under ground, by which means beside the destruction of Churches and Houses, there would have been at least an hundred and fifty Thousand Persons blown up into the Air, and when this was effected, the</HI> Banditi <HI>joining with others of the Gentry should have fallen upon the rest of the People in several places, and put them all to the Sword; Massanello</HI> upon this discovery caused present search to be made, and the Vaults and Powder being accordingly found, he spared the Mans life, but banished him the City and Kingdom for ever, and the Powder served the Peo∣ple for their use; It was discovered also by another of the <HI>Banditi</HI> put upon the Rack, <HI>That by the Contri∣vance of the Duty of</HI> Mataloni <HI>and his brother</HI> Peronne, <HI>the Pipes, and Aquoe-ducts which brought water to the City were poisoned, as also the Corn;</HI> which being found to be true, especially the Cisterns of Rain-Water; No∣tice was given by sound of Trumpet, and Bills fixed in all Quarters of the City, that none should drink of them; <HI>Massanello</HI> likewise sent Souldiers through all the City to sieze the rest of the <HI>Banditi,</HI> who had taken Sanctuary in divers Churches, and Monasteries, who being dragged out, their heads were chopped off, and set upon Poles up and down the Streets; They search'd for the Duke of <HI>Mataloni,</HI> but he escap∣ed to <HI>Benevento,</HI> yet whosoever of his Servants, Pages or Lacqueys fell into their hands, they presently Murdered them; And next they vented their Rage against <HI>Guiseppe Caraffa,</HI> and <HI>Gregory,</HI> Brothers to the Duke, who were hidden in the Monastery of St. <HI>Ma∣ries; Gregory</HI> foresaw the danger, and escaped betimes,
<PB N="128" REF="67"/>
and would have perswaded his Brother to have done the like, but he refused, and being taken by some of the Rabble, he offered them twelve Thousand pound in Gold to let him escape, but a Butchers Son with a great Knife cut his Throat, and chopped off his head, which was fixed upon a Pike, with this Inscription <HI>This is Don</HI> Caraffa<HI>'s head, a Rebel to his Countrey, and a Traytor to the most Faithful People;</HI> They used his Body also very despitefully, as also of four others his Com∣panions, whom they murthered with him, The head being carried to <HI>Massanello,</HI> he plucked him often by the Whiskers, using many opprobrious words against him and made a Speech to the People, wherein <HI>He told them of the Justice of God which comes surely though slowly to punish the Guilty,</HI> &amp;c. The People still cried out, <HI>Let Traitors die, Let Traitors die,</HI> and nothing was heard up and down the Streets but shreiking, and howlings, with horrible Curses, which made a hide∣ous noise in the Air.</P>
<P>At this Spectacle of <HI>Caraffa,</HI> the Cavaliers were much troubled, fearing least the People would destroy them all, who were now increased to the Number of one hundred and Forty Thousand Fighting men; <HI>Massanello</HI> supposing that the Vice-Roy had a hand in bringing in the <HI>Banditi,</HI> cut off all Provisions, and water from the Castle, whereby he, his Dutchess, his Council and Nobles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> began to find themselves to be in an ill condition; whereupon the Vice-Roy sent a Letter to the Archbishop, desiring him to make known to the People his sincere Intentions toward them, and that he was not only a stranger but an E∣nemy to the Practices of the <HI>Banditi,</HI> and that if he could catch any of them he would deliver them to the People; This the Arch-Bishop did, which some∣what allayed the Fury of the People, yet <HI>Massanello</HI> suspecting that there was a Plot to bring in more <HI>Ban∣diti</HI> to join with the Souldiers for surprising the City, he caused Barricadoes to be made at the end of eve∣ry Street, that one only might pass by them at a
<PB N="129" REF="67"/>
time, which was done with wonderful speed; He commanded also, <HI>That all Houses, Palaces, Monasteries,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>should in the night hang out Lights in their Windows, and make Fires in the Streets that they might the more ea∣sily discern if any of the</HI> Banditi <HI>entred, and all this to be done upon pain of burning down their Houses, which terri∣fied all men to obey;</HI> And now <HI>Massanello</HI> had an hundred and fifty Thousand armed men at his beck, so that he did no sooner signifie his pleasure but it was done in a Minute; If he said, <HI>Bring me the head of such a man, or let such a Palace he burnt, or the House of such a Prince be plundered,</HI> &amp;c. It was instantly done without delay or contradiction, a Glory that no King or Emperor ever yet attained to; He also by sound of Trumpet Proclaimed, <HI>That the Duke of</HI> Mataloni, <HI>was a Rebel to his King and Countrey, and that whoever should bring him in, should have thirty Thousand Crowns in Gold, and that his head should be a Ransom for one hundred and fifty</HI> Banditi, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thus ended the Fourth day being Wednesday.</P>
<P>Thursday <HI>July</HI> 11. <HI>Massanello</HI> went on with his Im∣perious commands; and truly it is a wonder, and will scarcely be believed in after Ages that a poor bare-legged Fisher-boy should have at his Command such a vast number of People as he had the very first day; and the second day he was attended by the Civiller and discreeter sort of Men. The third day he made himself <HI>Generalissimo</HI> over all who willingly obeyed his Commands; The fourth and fifth he won Admiration by his prudent and discreet Orders, ready dispatches, and quick Contrivances, and especially by his sprightfulness and Capacity in Negotiating bu∣sinesses of so great importance; The Archbishop who often treated with him, wondring at the same, see∣ing him behave himself, not like an abject Fellow, but some Great Commander, having Threats in his Looks, Terror in his Gestures, and Revenge in his Counten∣ance, whereby he subdued all <HI>Naples,</HI> which had in her six hundred Thousand Souls of all sorts. He made

Trenches, set Sentinels, laid spies, gave signs, chasti∣zed the <HI>Banditi,</HI> condemned the guilty, viewed the Squadrons, ranked their Files, comforted the fearful, confirmed the stout, encouraged the bold, promised rewards, threatned the suspected, reproached the cowards, applauded the valiant, and wonderfully in∣cited the minds of men by many degrees his Supe∣riors, to battels, burnings, plunder, spoil, blood and death; and it was admired that amongst such a con∣fused multitude he could proceed so regularly in his orders, and have them so exactly observed; He was very observant to Ladies, and Churchmen, not suffer∣ing any outrage to them; yea among such mighty rich goods as were burnt, he would not suffer the va∣lue of a pin to be converted to his own private use; The first order Published by <HI>Massanello</HI> on Thursday Morning was, <HI>That none should wear Cloaks, Gowns, Cassocks, &amp;c. nor women any Fardingals, and that when they went abroad they should tuck up their Petty-coats, least they should carry any Arms underneath;</HI> and it was strange to see what Universal Obedience was given to the same, then might you see even the Nobility, Churchmen, Religious Orders of all sorts, going up and down in querpo without upper Garments, during <HI>Mas∣sanello</HI>'s Reign, every one submitting to so vile a fellow.</P>
<P>This Morning likewise he caused the great Guns to be mounted, and planted in the most advantageous places of the City, and Guards of Horse and Foot placed near them; He commanded all Noble men, and Gentlemen to deliver their Arms to persons ap∣pointed, upon pain of death, and though this might expose them to the fury of the people, yet they durst not disobey; He also set a rate upon all edible Commodities; But now by the mediation of the Archbishop, Articles were drawn up between the Vice-Roy and the People, whereby their Priviledges were confirmed, and a general pardon granted, <HI>and the people were acknowledged for the King's Children, and the most Loyal Subjects he had in all his Dominions;</HI> About
<PB N="131" REF="68"/>
Ten a Clock this day, it being reported that the Ac∣cord was finished, and that <HI>Massanello</HI> was to go to the Vice-Roy to the Castle, for confirming it, with the hands of the Vice-Roy, the Council Royal, and the Council of State, hereupon an incredible multi∣tude of People Assembled together, and command was given under pain of Firing, <HI>That all Masters of Families should hang their Windows, Walls and Balconies, with the Richest Silks and Tapestryes that they had, and that all the wayes to the Castle should be swept clean;</HI> Which was no sooner spoken than done by persons of all sorts and ranks.</P>
<P><HI>Massanello</HI> then sent one of his Captains, to ac∣quaint the Vice-Roy of his purpose of coming to par∣lee with him, who answered, <HI>That he might when he pleased, for he would gladly see him;</HI> Presently after cloathing himself in Cloath of Silver, with a large Plume of White Feathers in his Hat, and a Naked Sword in his hand, he mounted on a Prancing Gel∣ding, and marched toward the Castle attended by Fifty Thousand of the choicest of the people, some on Foot, others on Horse-back, next after him fol∣lowed the Archbishop in his Coach, on whose right hand rode <HI>Massanello</HI>'s Brother, in Cloth of Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The cry was in every corner as they passed along, <HI>Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live, let the most faithful people of</HI> Naples <HI>live;</HI> When he came to the Castle he was met by the Captain of the Vice-Roys Guard, welcoming him in his Masters name to the Pallace, where his Ex∣cellency expected him with great desire. <HI>Massanello</HI> returning a grave and short answer; stopped, and made a sign to the People that they should go no far∣ther, there being Twenty Thousand already entred, and it was admirable to see how immoveably they all stood, and with incredible silence; whereupon alight∣ing, he began with a loud, yet gentle voice, to ex∣hort them to return thanks for their good success in obtaining their Liberties, telling them, <HI>That for his own part he desired nothing but the publick good; For,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="69"/>
said he, <HI>I was offered Two Hundred Crowns a Month, all the time of my life, if I would have desisted, but I do refuse it; Moreover if the Archbishop had not enjoyned me, and threatned me with Excommunication, I would not have apparelled my self as you now see me, I would never have altered my Seamans Cloths, such a one I was born, such a one I lived, and such a one I mean to dye, after I have once Established the publick Liberty; But yet lay not down your Arms, till a Confirmation comes from the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>Trust not the Nobles they are Traytors, and our Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>After which he went into the Castle, and upon the Stairs the Vice-Roy met him, to whom he humbled himself, thanking him for condescending to their Ar∣ticles, telling him, <HI>That he might dispose of him as he pleased, either to hang him, break him on the Wheel, or any other kind of death;</HI> But the Vice-Roy raised him up, telling him, <HI>That he knew not that he had committed any fault, nor had offended his Majesty, and therefore he should be cheerful, and that he should alwayes respect him;</HI> And herewith he often embraced him; Whilst they were consulting together, a rumor arose among that infi∣nite number of people which staid without; That <HI>Massanello</HI> was arrested, or some hurt done to him, therefore the Vice-Roy took him with the Arch-Bi∣shop unto a Balcony, where he might be seen of all, who looking on the people, said to them, <HI>Lo I am here, I am alive and free, Peace, Peace,</HI> at which the multitude exceedingly rejoyced; Then said <HI>Massanel∣lo</HI> to the Vice-Roy; <HI>My Lord, you shall see how obedient the People be,</HI> and so he bid them cry, <HI>Let God live, let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live,</HI> &amp;c. which they immediate∣ly did; and then he added, <HI>Let the ill Government dye,</HI> they all cryed so likewise; Then putting his finger to his mouth, there was a profound universal silence, that scarce a man was seen to breath; He then with a loud voice commanded, that every one there pre∣sent should depart from that Court, under pain of Rebellion and Death, which was punctually and pre∣sently obeyed, whereat the Vice-Roy was much asto∣nished;
<PB N="133" REF="69"/>
After many discourses it was agreed, <HI>That the Peoples demands should be printed, and subscribed by the Vice-Roy and all his Councils, and that the Sunday follow∣ing they should all come to the Cathedral, and there swear to observe them for ever;</HI> as also to procure the Confir∣mation thereof from his Catholick Majesty, after which <HI>Massanello</HI> took leave to depart; At his depar∣ture the Vice-Roy gave him a rich Chain of Gold worth three thousand Crowns, putting it about his neck with his own hands, and declared him to be the Duke of St. <HI>George,</HI> both which he would have refu∣sed, but that the Archbishop advised him to the con∣trary. <HI>Massanello</HI> then went with the Archbishop to his Palace, and whilst they were discoursing together, a Rumour was spread that many of the <HI>Banditi</HI> were coming into the City, but it proved to be the Mar∣quess of St. <HI>Ermo,</HI> who with his Followers returned from his Countrey house to the City; yet had the jealous People almost pulled him to peices had not <HI>Massanello</HI> at the request of a Lady interposed for his safety, and so ended the fifth day being Thursday, <HI>July,</HI> 11. 1647.</P>
<P>On Friday Morning there came a Boat with 6 Mar∣riners, and four men compleatly armed, which brought Letters from the Duke of <HI>Mataloni</HI> to his Se∣cretary, and because they were written in dark Cy∣phers, <HI>Massanello</HI> caused the four men first to be racked, and then to have their heads chopped off. The same morning he erected another Tribunal of Justice, substituting a Leiutenant under him, who presently condemned four <HI>Banditi,</HI> and beheaded them. <HI>Massanello</HI> also having left off his Cloth of Silver, ap∣peared in his old Mariners habit, and yet was obeyed and feared by every one. He stood in a Window to give Audience, and to receive Petitions, which they reached up to him upon the ends of Pikes; All his Orders ran in these words, <HI>Ʋnder pain of Rebellion and Death;</HI> and it was wonderful to see so many Com∣mands, Bans, Commissions and Orders published
<PB N="134" REF="70"/>
and affixed to Posts subscribed, Thomas Anello <HI>Cap∣tain General of the most faithful People of</HI> Naples; all which were executed with incredible readiness and exact∣ness; This morning he issued out an order, <HI>That eve∣ry one should cut off his great Lock, and wear no Perriwigs;</HI> He likewise renewed his former Order, <HI>That Church∣men should not wear their upper Garment, because by that means many</HI> Banditi <HI>came into the City.</HI> There was ano∣ther Order, <HI>That upon sounding the two a Clock Bell in the night, every one upon pain of death should retire to his Lodg∣ing;</HI> And because many of the Nobility and Ladies were retired into the Monasteries and Nunneries, he commanded, <HI>That upon pain of death they should all re∣turn to their Houses,</HI> which was presently obeyed; Then he commanded, <HI>That all the Inhabitants both Natives and Forreigners should set upon their Gates the King of</HI> Spain<HI>'s Arms on the right hand, and the City Arms on the left;</HI> which was suddenly put in Execution, though with much trouble to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> Many Delin∣quents were put to death; He caused a Baker to be baked to death, because he made his bread too light. He had seven Secetaries, and ten Officers to punish whom he pleased, and he was feared and obeyed with as much exactness as if it had been the <HI>Great Turk,</HI></P>
<P>A Choice Horse being sent <HI>Massanello</HI> worth four Hundred Ducats, he sent him presently to the Kings Stable, saying, <HI>That he was too good for his use;</HI> There were about an hundred Thousand Crowns discovered in a By-place, which he caused to be reserved for the Kings Use, withal offering the Vice-Roy five Millions, if need were; Many great Presents being sent him from Gentlemen, he would not receive the value of one farthing; He employed many to search after the Servants and Kindred of the Duke of <HI>Mataloni,</HI> and his Brother; and when they were brought to him, he examined them upon the Rack where their Persons and Goods were, and at last one confessing that their Goods were hidden in several Churches and Monaste∣ries; He caused them immediately to be searcht for,

both above and under ground, whence were brought forth abundance of rich things, valued at five Hun∣dred Thousand Crowns, besides four Thousand Crowns in ready Money; all which being brought to <HI>Massa∣nello,</HI> he employed the Money to pay his Souldiers and laid up the Goods in a Magazine, none daring to touch a Rag of it; He sent also to make a new search in the Houses whence he had formerly taken and burnt their Goods, and found much more in Wells, Pits, Houses of Office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with great quantities of Silver and Gold; He sent also armed men into the Coun∣trey to burn the House, Goods, and Furniture of the the Duke of <HI>Caivano,</HI> which was done accordingly, as also the Palace of <HI>Mataloni,</HI> with all that was within, whom likewise they hanged in <HI>Effigie</HI> in the Market-place, because they could not catch his Person; Then he commanded them to burn the Goods of divers other Officers, and particularly of the Kings Visitors; yet at the request of the Archbishop it was not put in Exe∣cution; In the mean time the Vice-Roy being be∣sieged in his Castle and deprived of Provisions, he sent to <HI>Massanello</HI> for some supply, which he readily consented to, sending him 50 Porters loaden with all sorts of Provision, and Shops were opened, and all People went up and down with as much security, as if there had been no Souldiers, nor disturbance in the City, so strict and rigorous was he in the Execution of Justice; At the same time 13 Gallies of <HI>Naples</HI> arriv∣ing at the Port, their Admiral sent to the Vice-Roy for a supply of Provisions; But he sent Messengers to <HI>Massanello,</HI> who promised them a supply, but on con∣dition they should go farther off, and none of them come ashore, which was done accordingly; Presently after, came divers from the Castle, bringing Presents from the Vice-Roy to <HI>Massanello,</HI> with Thanks for the plentiful provision he had sent him, amongst which was a Rich Suit of Clothes for his own wearing; The Vice-Queen also sent to know how he did, desiring him for her sake to make use of the things that were sent him.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="71"/>Saturday, <HI>July</HI> 13. <HI>Massanello</HI> knowing that his safe∣ty consisted in keeping the people in exact obedi∣ence, which hitherto he had done; he punished the least Act of disobedience with death, and under∣standing that the night before, some were employed in going about amongst the Shop-keepers, to make them sensible of their slavery under him; He sent out strict orders for apprehending them, and hanged them up before the shops where they had been, and among them two of the Duke of <HI>Mataloni's</HI> Servants were hanged, who had brought Letters in the soles of their shoes, written in Cyphers, which none could understand; Then being informed of a Burglary which was committed that night, and that it was done by some <HI>Banditi,</HI> who had taken Sanctuary in a Church, he caused them to be dragged out, and ex∣ecuted; A Young Maid complained to him, that one of his Souldiers had Murthered her Father, whereupon the Brother of the Murtherer promised, that if the fault might be remitted, he would Marry the Maid; but she refusing, <HI>Massanello</HI> caused him to give her Two Hundred Crowns for a Dowry, and so pardoned him; Now Intelligence being brought, that the <HI>Banditi</HI> were joyned together in divers pla∣ces, to invade the City; He made Proclamation, <HI>That what</HI> Banditi <HI>soever should discover the Plot; he should be absolutely pardoned;</HI> and a Message of conse∣quence being brought him by a Cavalier; He said, <HI>I will have nothing to do with the Cavaliers, God hath set me up for the peoples good;</HI> and turning to them, he said, <HI>My People pray for me, and preserve me well, for if you lose me, woe be to you;</HI> The same Morning came in multitudes of People out of the Countrey round about, and amongst them, Women and Children, with swords and staves to do their Homage to <HI>Massa∣nello,</HI> and to be redressed by him of their grievances; About the same time he sent to the Vice-Roy, to mind him of his promise of coming the next day, being Sunday, with all his Councellors, to confirm
<PB N="137" REF="71"/>
his grants by all their Oaths, which accordingly was done; For after dinner the Vice-Roy sent two of his best Horses with rich Furniture for <HI>Massanello,</HI> and his Brother, who mounting upon them, went to∣wards the Castle, <HI>Massanello</HI> carrying in one hand a naked sword, and in the other the Charter of <HI>Charles</HI> 5. Emperor; His Brother carryed the Capitulati∣ons made with the Vice-Roy, and being accompani∣ed with a huge number of people, they arrived at the Castle, and being Conducted into the Pallace, they entertain themselves a while with the Vice-Roy; And then all returned into the City with the Vice-Roy, and all his Councellors; The streets were clean swept by <HI>Massanello</HI>'s Command, and the Houses adorn∣ed with the Richest Hangings; and thus they went to the Archbishops Palace, the People crying all the way as they went, <HI>Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live; but with∣out Gabels;</HI> At the Arch-Bishops Palace they all alight∣ed, and were met by him, and his Chaplains, in their Robes, and so going into the Church, and kneeling at the High Altar, the Secretary of the Kingdom read the Articles with a loud voice, <HI>Massanello</HI> standing by, and to the wonderment of all, added, altered, cor∣rected, and interpreted them at his pleasure, no man presuming to contradict him; After which the Vice-Roy, with all the Officers of State, swore to ob∣serve, and keep the said Capitulations to perpetuity, and to get them confirmed by Oath of his Catholick Majesty; After which followed Musick, and <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung for this good agreement.</P>
<P>When all was ended, <HI>Massanello</HI> told them, <HI>That in the last sixteen years the King of</HI> Spain <HI>had had of them above an Hundred Millions, but that the greatest part of it was consumed by his Officers, who enriched them∣selves by the Kings and Peoples losses, which he was resol∣ved to redress for the time to come, and thereby prove him∣self a faithful Subject, and Friend to the King;</HI> Which he spoke with such earnestness, that all the multi∣tude gave him a loud applause; Thus businesses be∣ing

finished, he attended the Vice-Roy and his train back to the Castle, where all the Ordnance was dis∣charged, and <HI>Massanello</HI> told them, <HI>That having now brought his honest intents to pass, he would return to be a Fisherman;</HI> and so tearing off his garments of Silver, he returned with all the People to the Market place, who wonderfully rejoyced for having thus attained their desires. This day being Sunday <HI>July</HI> 14. the Papers of the agreement were fixed up and down in all parts of <HI>Naples,</HI> which caused not only great joy in the hearts of the people, but every one extolled <HI>Massanello</HI> as the Instrument, and next to him the Archbishop, as the Mediator of that accord; And it was no small astonishment in the minds of many, to consider that such great things were effected, not by the power of a Mighty Emperour, and Conque∣rour, but by the conduct of a poor bare legged Fish∣er-boy; Now though peace seemed to be setled, yet it was not judged fit presently to dismiss the Souldie∣ry, therefore <HI>Massanello</HI> commanded them to stand firm to their Guard; and withal made Proclamation, <HI>That every one upon pain of death should discover if any goods were deposited in their hands, of those whose houses had been burnt;</HI> Whereupon much wealth was brought out of Churches, Monasteries, Hospitals and Nun∣neries, and being informed that four <HI>Banditi</HI> had ta∣ken Sanctuary among the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> he sent some to fetch them thence, who having forced open the doors, found them, and chopped off their heads, and a <HI>Jesuit</HI> zealous of the Churches Priviledges, ma∣king some resistance, they so wounded him that he presently after dyed; Notice being likewise given of much Goods hid in a Nunnery, he sent some Cap∣tains to fetch it into the Market place to be burnt, the Captains being denyed entrance, forced the doors, and so behaved themselves, that one of the Nuns almost dyed through fear; which the Arch-Bishop complaining of to <HI>Massanello,</HI> he sent for the Cap∣tains, and after Examination beheaded them; The
<PB N="139" REF="72"/>
same Morning he published a Proclamation, <HI>That none should go out of the City without his License;</HI> whereup∣on the Archbishop of St. <HI>Severine</HI> being to go into his Diocess went without a Cloke, according to former Order, to <HI>Massanello</HI> for a Pass; <HI>Massanello</HI> when he saw him, said, <HI>What wilt thou have my fine Lord? I de∣sire with your good leave</HI> (saith the Archbishop) <HI>that I may safely pass to my Church; Go,</HI> saith he, <HI>and let four hundred of my men go to guard you thither; It needs not,</HI> said the Archbishop, <HI>for I go by Sea; Then,</HI> said he, <HI>Let forty Barges be provided to attend you; I have,</HI> said the Archbishop, <HI>four already for my Family which is suffi∣cient; Well,</HI> said <HI>Massanello, you may do your pleasure, yet you shall not refuse this bag of double Pistoles to bear your charges.</HI> The Archbishop would have refused them, but he forced five hundred upon him, which he durst not but accept for fear of angering him.</P>
<P>The same morning also he caused a Bakers house to be burnt for making bread too light, and chopped off the head of an Abbot and some others, as being De∣pendants upon the Duke of <HI>Matalone;</HI> He sent to the Jesuites and other Religious Orders, for a great sum of Money for the Service of the People; He sent to many Rich Men, and caused them to bind themselves to pay great Sums that he might make good his Pro∣mise to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> of a Donative of six Millions of Gold; This Morning a Kinsman of <HI>Massanello</HI>'s in whom he much confided went to the Palace, com∣plaining openly, <HI>That</HI> Massanello <HI>began to dote,</HI> and a Chaplain of the Archbishop came to him from his Lord, desiring him now things were at peace to disband his Souldiers, and to retire himself a while into a pleasant Island (whither they used to go for Recreation) to refresh himself; This pleased him well, and several Companies of superfluous Souldiers were disbanded, no man grumbling at any thing he did; which made him grow proud, and multiplicity of Businesses and want of sleep distempering his Brain, he gave forth many cruel Edicts for burning of Pa∣laces,
<PB N="140" REF="73"/>
chopping off heads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereupon some of his Captains complained to the Archbishop that he grew intolerable, imprisoning, and commanding their Heads to be cut off to please his Humor; The Arch-Bishop laboured to moderate and mollifie him, at least to procure his deferring the Execution for that holy day, which he obtained; That afternoon <HI>Mas∣sanello</HI> went with a multitude of People following him to the Castle in an odd habit, desiring the Vice-Roy to go with him to that Island to take the fresh Air, but he excused it by reason of a pain in his head, yet commanded his <HI>Gondola</HI> to be made ready to wait upon Seignior <HI>Massanello,</HI> into which he embarqued himself with divers Mariners, and had forty Barges of Musicians to make him Merry; and as he sailed along he threw peices of Gold into the Sea, which the Ma∣riners dived to fetch up again for his Pastime, and all the afternoon he spent in Mirth, Eating and Drink∣ing too freely of the Wine called <HI>Lachrymae Christi;</HI> and when he returned in the Evening, he gave all them that attended him 1O Measures of Wheat apiece. The same afternoon, <HI>Massanello</HI>'s Wife, Mother and Sister, clad in Cloth of Silver, with Chains of Gold, and other Rich Jewels, went in a stately Coach va∣lued at eight Thousand Crowns to give the Vice-Queen a Visit, attended with divers other Gentle∣women, and when she came to the Palace, Sedans were sent for her and her Company, with a Guard of Halberdiers, Pages, and Lacquies to attend them; The Vice-Queen presented her with a rich Diamond giving her great welcome, and many Dainties, and so returned, where they found <HI>Massanello</HI> so heated with his Wine that he scarce knew what he said or did, and thus ended Sunday.</P>
<P>On Monday Morning he would have resigned his Power, but his Wife and Kindred disswaded him, and himself conceived, that if he should do it, he could ex∣pect no other but death, but now when he came to manage his Authority, he committed so many Fop∣peries
<PB N="141" REF="73"/>
and Tyrannical Acts, as made him hated by those who before had adored him, and the reason of his distempered Brain was conceived to be from a fa∣tal drink given him by the Vice-Roy the day before; To which may be added, want of Food and Sleep, for he was seldom at leasure to do either, in regard of multiplicity of business which wholly took him up, Early that morning he rode into the Market-place with a naked Sword in his hand, striking many, for no cause offered; A Captain who came to him about business he wounded in the Face; and meeting with one that was said to be a Spy, he caused his head pre∣sently to be chopped off: another complaining, that his Wife was gone away with another man, he caused the Woman to be hanged, and the Man to be broken on the wheel. Then going to the Kings Stables, he took for himself and his Followers six of the best Horses, but before he had gone far, better bethinking himself, he sent them all back again. The Vice-Roy himself hearing of such Extravagancies trembled, and retired into the inner Palace, causing it to be forti∣fied, and increased his Guard; Then <HI>Massanello</HI> sent to two Noblemen to come to him into the Market-place, upon pain of burning their Palaces, if disobey∣ing; who returned answer, <HI>That they would wait on him;</HI> But instead thereof, having secured their Goods, they went to the Vice-Roy to complain of their Slavish Condition, and whilst they were considering how to remedy it, there came two of his chief Friends and Counsellors making the same Complaint, saying, <HI>That they were in continual danger of their Lives, and that the People began to hate</HI> Massanello <HI>for his extream Cruelty;</HI> whereupon it was concluded, <HI>That the People should be perswaded to make their Addresses to the Vice-Roy, and therein to declare that they would have no more dependance upon him, but upon his Excellency only, provided that they might be assured to enjoy their Priviledges lately confirmed by Oath;</HI> This the Vice-Roy willingly assented to, and the People were perswaded to accept of the Conditi∣ons,
<PB N="142" REF="74"/>
and <HI>Massanello</HI> being gone abroad to take his plea∣sure, many of them met with the Vice-Roy, where it was concluded, <HI>That</HI> Massanello <HI>should be laid hold on, and kept in chains during his life, but not put to death be∣cause of the good he had done for the People;</HI> At <HI>Massanel∣lo</HI>'s return, being extreamly inflamed with Wine, he began to play many mad Pranks; whereupon the Captains of the People apprehended him, and put him in Custody under a Guard of Souldiers, and the Peo∣ple confederating with the Vice-Roy hastened his End.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>July</HI> 16, in the Morning <HI>Massanello</HI>'s Se∣cretary meeting some Bands of men going towards the Castle, proudly asked them, <HI>By whose Authority they Acted,</HI> One of the Captains answered, <HI>By the Authority of the Vice-Roy; Well,</HI> said the Secretary, <HI>thy head shall pay for this;</HI> whereupon the Captain wounded him with his Sword, and another shot him through, and so they put him into a Sepulchre, But the people that adhered to the Vice-Roy drew him out, cut off his head, and dragged his body about the Streets; Presently after, <HI>Massanello</HI> escaping out of Prison, went to the Church of the Virgin of <HI>Carmine,</HI> and the Archbishop coming to sing Mass there, it being a great Festival day to that Saint, <HI>Massanello</HI> met him, saying, <HI>Most Eminent Lord I perceive that the People will now for∣sake me, and go about to take away my life, I desire that a Solemn Procession may be made to this most holy Lady, for being to die, I shall then die with greater content;</HI> The Church being full of People, <HI>Massanello</HI> went to the Altar, and taking a Crucifix in his hand, he com∣mended, himself to the People, remembring then what great things he had done for them; the diffi∣culties he had encountered with, and the hatred that he had procured to himself thereby, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then prostrating himself at the Archbishops Feet, he desir∣ed him to send the Vice-Roy word, <HI>That he would willingly renounce his Command, and resign it into his Ex∣cellencies hand;</HI> which the Archbishop promised him to
<PB N="143" REF="74"/>
do, and seeing him all in a sweat, he conveyed him into a Dormitory to be refreshed, and so he left him.</P>
<P><HI>Massanello</HI> after a while went into the Hall, and some that were hired to murther him, rushed into the room, crying aloud, <HI>Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live, and let none hereafter upon pain of death obey</HI> Massanello. <HI>Massa∣nello</HI> seeing them, said, <HI>You go perhaps to search for me, behold me here my people;</HI> Whereupon some shot at him, and he crying out, <HI>Ah ingrateful Traytors,</HI> fell down dead; Then came a Butcher and cut off his Head, and carried it upon a Lance, first into the Church, and then to the Market-place, crying out, <HI>Let the King of</HI> Spain <HI>live,</HI> Massanello <HI>is dead,</HI> Massa∣nello <HI>is dead;</HI> and withal they discharged some <HI>Har∣quebusses,</HI> whereupon the affrighted people slunk a∣way, not daring to Revenge their Captains death; so that they carried his head up and down the City, and the Boys dragged his Body up and down the Streets, and at last his head was thrown into one Ditch, and his Body into another; And thus as the Almighty for the sins of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> punished them by small and inconsiderable means, so did he Correct, Humble, and Chastize the Stately, proud City of <HI>Na∣ples</HI> by so mean a Person, who in ten dayes time acted the part of the Greatest Monarch upon Earth, and then fell to the lowest Contempt, and died the most vile death of the greatest Malefactor. Thus <HI>Massa∣nello</HI> being raised by the popular Air, slain and scorn∣ed by the same people, Honoured and Idolized by the same persons, may be compared to a Ball tos∣sed up and down by Fortune; The voice went af∣terward that a Chappel should be built for him, and the prime Wits of <HI>Naples</HI> composed several Epitaphs upon him, amongst which, the following is thus Englished by <HI>J.

<PB N="148" REF="77"/>
fiercely at them, but was beset and taken; the Nails of his Hands and Feet bowed inward, he spake no∣thing, but sent out an inarticulate sound, they brought him thence to a Gentlemans House not far off, where they put Iron Manacles upon his Hands and Feet; in the end by being long kept Fasting, they had brought him to a Tameness, and in seven months had taught him to speak; He was afterward by Circumstance of time, and six Fingers he had on one hand, known to be the Child of a Woman, who stealing Wood was pursued by the Officers, and in her fright left her Chile then about nine Months old, which as is sup∣posed was carried away by the She-wolf aforesaid, and by her nourished to the time of his taking. When his Guardians had got much money by shewing him from place to place, he afterward was a Herdsman of Sheep and other Beasts for seven years; in all which time the Wolves never made any attempts on the Herds and Flocks committed to his charge, though he kept great store of Oxen, Kine, Calves, Horses, Mares, Sheep and Poultry; This was well observed by neigbouring Villages; and that they might partici∣pate of this Benefit they drove their Herds and Flocks where he kept his, and desired him but to stroke his hands upon them, which he would do, with some of his phlegm or spittle upon them; after which done, (let others conjecture as they please) for the space of fifteen days, Dogs of the greatest fierceness, nor any Wolves would by any urgency touch them; By this means he got great store of money, for he would have a double <HI>Turnois,</HI> which is the value of two-pence in that Countrey, for every Beast he so laid his hands on, or stroked their Ears; But as all things have a certain Period, so when he had attained to past fourteen years of Age, this Virtue which he had, left him; himself observed that the Wolves would not come so near him as before, but keep aloof off, as being fearful of him, which possibly might proceed from the change of his Complexion and Tempera∣ture

their own, and would make it their business to render our Nation as poor as their own, for this he with the rest of them, were afterwards frowned on by the King, and lost his Command of the Guards.</P>
<P>However Sir <HI>Walter</HI> still pursued the good and Glory of his Countrey, and as formerly in active times, gave his Advice against the Peace with <HI>Spain,</HI> who might now with no great difficulty be brought on his knees; At the entrance of the King, he presented him with a Manuscript of his own Writing, with no weak Ar∣guments against Peace; But Sir <HI>Walter</HI> was mistaken, for his Counsel was ill timed, and a new Part was now to be acted, the Scene being changed; Peace was the Kings aim, whether out of Fear or Religious Princi∣ples is not determined; But with <HI>Spain</HI> a Peace is con∣cluded, though an Enemy already humbled, who had now time to recover their Losses, and were as it were cherished to assault us with the greater Vigor; and the success thereof every one knows; and as if the King would go quite contrary to Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Po∣litiques, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are despised, flighted, and deserted, under pretence, that it was of ill Example for a Monarch to protect them.</P>
<P>And now (though somewhat contrary to my me∣thod) it may not be unuseful to give a breif Account of the fall of this once Great Favorite; King <HI>James</HI> is hardly warm in his Throne but there is a great noise of a <HI>Plot</HI> generally called Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI>'s <HI>Treason,</HI> but upon what grounds is uncertain, since at his Trial it appeared he had the least hand in it; A <HI>Plot</HI> that is still a Mystery, and hath a Vail spread over it, A <HI>Plot</HI> composed of such a hodg-podg of Religion and Interests that the World stands amazed, Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> should be drawn into it; A <HI>Plot</HI> so unlikely to hurt others or benefit themselves, that as <HI>Osborn</HI> says, <HI>If ever Folly was capable of the Title, or Pity due to Innocence, theirs might claim so large a share as not possibly to be too severely condemned, or slightly enough punished;</HI> Envy and Disdain (as Sir <HI>Walter</HI> has told us in his

Remains) seek Innovation by Faction; Discontent is the great Seducer which at first put him to search into a Plot he afterward was betrayed into; The cheif In∣gredients of this Medley were two Popish Priests, <HI>Wat∣son</HI> and <HI>Clark,</HI> and Count <HI>Aremberg</HI> Ambassador Extra∣ordinary from the Arch-duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> who brought in the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and he his brother <HI>George Brook,</HI> both seeming Protestants; <HI>Brook</HI> drew in Sir <HI>Edward Parham</HI> and others, and they the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Wilton,</HI> a zealous Puritan; then came in Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> the wisest of them all (says Mr. <HI>Sanderson</HI>) who dalli∣lied, says he, like a fly in the Flame till it consumed him, Willing he was to know the Design, and thought by his Wit to over-reach the Confederates, whom he knew well enough, though he dealt with none but <HI>Cobham;</HI> One Mr. <HI>Laurency</HI> an <HI>Antwerp</HI> Merchant was made use of by Count <HI>Aremberg,</HI> and was an intimate of the Lord <HI>Cobham's,</HI> these says <HI>Sanderson,</HI> carried on the contrivance a great while, which at last was be∣trayed by <HI>Laurency,</HI> and the Vigilancy of the Lord <HI>Cecil.</HI> And indeed it was morally impossible that so many disagreeing weak Souls should carry on a Pro∣ject without taking Air, the least glimpse being e∣nough to give Light to the Statesmen of those times.</P>
<P>The Design they were charged with was, 1. <HI>To set the Crown on the head of the Lady</HI> Arabella Stewart, <HI>or to seize the King, and make him grant their desires, or a Pardon;</HI> and that Lord <HI>Cobham</HI> should say to <HI>Brook, It will never be well in</HI> England <HI>till the King and his Cubs be taken away.</HI> 2. <HI>To have a Toleration of Religion.</HI> 3. <HI>To procure Aid and Assistance, from Forreign Princes.</HI> 4. <HI>To turn out of the Court such as they disliked, and place themselves in Offices.</HI> Watson <HI>to be Lord Chancellor,</HI> George Brook <HI>Lord Treasurer, Sir</HI> Griffin Markham <HI>Secretary of State;</HI> Lord Grey <HI>to be Master of the Horse, and Earl Marshal of</HI> England; But it seems they made no Provision for <HI>Rawleigh,</HI> which is no inconsiderable Argument of his Innocency, who could have deserved, and might

have expected as great a reward as any of them had he been engaged in the <HI>Plot;</HI> To oblige to Secrecy, <HI>Watson</HI> draws up an Oath; But all is betrayed, they are Seized, Examined and Tryed at <HI>Winchester,</HI> Nov. 17. 1603. and the Lord <HI>Cobham, George Brook,</HI> his Brother, <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Wilton,</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Raw∣leigh,</HI> Sir <HI>Griffith Markham,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Parham</HI> Knights, <HI>Bartholomew Brooksby,</HI> and <HI>Anthony Copley</HI> Gen∣tlemen, <HI>W. Watson, W. Clark</HI> Priests, were all found guilty of Treason, (except Sir <HI>Edward Parham</HI> who was ac∣quitted;) and <HI>Watson</HI> and <HI>Clark</HI> were executed <HI>Nov.</HI> 29. <HI>George Brook</HI> was beheaded, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 5. but here the hand of Justice staid, the Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> and Sir <HI>Griffith Markham</HI> were pardoned at the place of Execution; Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> was left to the Kings Mercy, who thought him too great a Male-con∣tent to have his Freedom, and probably too innocent to lose his Life. Therefore he is confined to the Tower, where he writ that excellent <HI>History of the World,</HI> where∣in the only fault or defect rather is, that it wanteth one half thereof, which was occasioned as it is com∣monly related, thus; Some few days before he suffer∣ed, he sent for Mr. <HI>Walter Burr,</HI> who formerly printed his first Volume of the <HI>History of the World,</HI> and asking him how it sold, Mr. <HI>Burr</HI> answered, <HI>It sold so slowly that it had undone him;</HI> At which words Sir <HI>Walter</HI> stepping to his Desk, reaches his other unprinted part of his History, which he had brought down to the times he lived in, and clapping his hand upon his breast said with a sigh; <HI>Ah my friend, hath the first part undone thee, the second Part shall undo no more; this ungrateful World is unworthy of it;</HI> and immediately going to the Fire∣side threw it in, and set his Foot upon it till it was con∣sumed; As great a loss to Learning as <HI>Christendom</HI> could have sustained, and the greater because it could be repaired by no hand but his.</P>
<P>While Sir <HI>Walter was thus confined,</HI> Death took away his Mortal Enemy Sir <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> after Earl of <HI>Sa∣lisbury,</HI> who had purchased the Monopoly of Favour,
<PB N="166" REF="86"/>
and being jealous of Sir <HI>Walters</HI> Abilities, had some fear he might supplant him, which was the cause, says <HI>Osborn,</HI> that he was brought to the aforementioned Trial; However Sir <HI>Walter</HI> outlived his Designs and Hatred, and for all kindnesses bestowed on him the following Epitaph, which is certainly affirmed to be his; King <HI>James</HI> was so taken with the smartness of them, that he hoped the Author would dye before him; The Verses are these,
<Q><L>Here lies <HI>Hobnial</HI> our Pastor while er'e</L>
<L>That once in a Quarter our Fleeces did share</L>
<L>To please us, his Cur he kept under Clog</L>
<L>And was ever after both Shepherd and Dog;</L>
<L>For Oblation to <HI>Pan,</HI> his Custom was thus,</L>
<L>He first gave a Trifle, then offered up us;</L>
<L>And through his false worship such power he did gain</L>
<L>As kept him o'th' Mountain, and us on the Plain;</L>
<L>Where many an Hornpipe he tun'd to his <HI>Phillis,</HI></L>
<L>And sweetly sung <HI>Walsingham</HI> to's <HI>Amaryllis,</HI></L>
<L>Till <HI>Atropos</HI> clapt him a P— on the Drab</L>
<L>For spight of his Tar-box he di'd of the Scab.</L></Q></P>
<P>If the Reader desires a key to these Verses, he may have it in <HI>Osborn</HI>'s <HI>Memoirs;</HI> Fourteen years Sir <HI>Walter</HI> had spent in the Tower, (of whom Prince <HI>Henry</HI> would say, <HI>That no King but his Father would keep such a Bird in a Cage</HI>) and being weary of Confinement, his Destiny brought him to his end by Liberty, which it could not do by Imprisonment; For out of a longing for Liberty, he propounded a Project to the King, upon which, being a well spoken man, and of great Capacity, he set such colours of Probability, especi∣ally guilding it over with the Gold he would fetch from a Mine <HI>Guiana</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> without any wrong at all to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that the King granted him a limited Commission to undertake it, and thereupon with divers Ships accompanied with many Knights and Gentlemen of Quality, he set forward on the
<PB N="167" REF="86"/>
Voyage, but when after long search, no such Place nor Treasure could be found, he fell upon St. <HI>Thome,</HI> a Town belonging to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> Sacked, Pil∣laged, and Burnt it; And here was the first part of his Tragical Voyage Acted, in the death of his Eldest Son, the last part was acted in his own death at his return; For <HI>Gundamore</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Embassador did so aggravate this Fact to the King against him, that it seemed nothing would give satisfaction but <HI>Rawleigh's</HI> head, without which he seemed to threaten a breach between the two Nations; <HI>Rawleigh</HI> excused his Acti∣ons, and sent this Defence thereof in a Letter to King <HI>James;</HI>

<P>Before Sir <HI>Walter</HI> made this Voyage, the King com∣manded him upon pain of his Allegiance to give him under his hand (promising on the word of a King to keep it secret) the number of his Men, the Burthen and Strength of his Ships, together with the Coun∣trey and River he was to enter, which being done ac∣cordingly by Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> That very Original Paper was found in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governours Closet at St. <HI>Thoma,</HI> so active were the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ministers that Advertise∣ment was sent to <HI>Spain,</HI> and thence to the <HI>Indies</HI> be∣fore the <HI>English</HI> Fleet got out of the <HI>Thames;</HI> But now no Apology though never so perswasive could satisfie <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndamores</HI> Rage, who as soon as news came of the firing St <HI>Thoma,</HI> desired Audience of the King, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he had but one word to say; His Majesty wondering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> be delivered in one word, when he came

before him he only bawl'd out, <HI>Pyrates, Pyrates, Pyrates;</HI> And was therefore now resolved to sacrifice the only Favourite left of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Interest, and who was the only Person of the Earl <HI>Essex</HI>'s Enemies that died lamented, and the only Man of Note left alive that had helped to beat the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in 1588.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Walter</HI> was arrived at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> Sir <HI>Lewes Steukly</HI> seized him, and was ordered by the King to bring him to <HI>London,</HI> which could add no Terror to a Person who could expect nothing less; and was now forced to use all the Arts imaginable to appease Hls Majesty and defer his Anger; To which intent <HI>Manow∣ry</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Quack at <HI>Salisbury</HI> gave him several Vomits, and an Artificial Composition, which made him look Gastly and Dreadful, full of Pimples and Blisters, and deceiv'd even the Physitians themselves, who could not tell what to make of his Urine (though often in∣spected) it being adulterated with a Drug in the Glass that turned it even in their hands into an earthy humor of a blackish colour and of a very Offensive Savour; while he lay under this Politick disguize, he penned his Dedication and Apology aforementi∣oned, when he was brought to <HI>London,</HI> he was confin∣ed only to his own house, but finding the Court whol∣ly guided by <HI>Gundamore,</HI> he could hope for little Mer∣cy, therefore he designed to escape into <HI>France,</HI> which Sir <HI>Lewes Steukly</HI> betrayed; but the Fate of Traytors pursued him and brought him to a Contemptible end, to dye a poor distracted Beggar in the Isle of <HI>Lindey,</HI> having for a Bag of Money falsified his Faith, confirm∣ed by the tye of the Holy Sacrament (as Mr. <HI>Howel</HI> relates) and also before the year came about was found clipping the same very Coin (in the Kings own Palace at <HI>Whitehal</HI>) which he had received for a reward of his Perfidiousness; for which being condemned to be hang'd, he was forced to sell himself to his Shirt to purchase his Pardon of two Knights.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="88"/>The King being willing to Sacrifice the life of Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> to the advancement of the peace with <HI>Spain;</HI> Upon St. <HI>Simon and Judes</HI> day, the Lieutenant of the Tower had a Warrant to bring his Prisoner to the King's Bench Bar in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> where the Attorney General demanded Execution according to the Judgment pronounced against him at <HI>Winchester;</HI> The Lord Chief Justice caused the In∣dictment, Verdict, and Judgment to be read, and after asked him, <HI>What he could say, why he should not dye according to Law?</HI> His answer was, <HI>That this</HI> 15 <HI>Years he had lived upon the meer mercy of the King, and did now wonder h w his mercy should be now turned into Judgment, he not knowing any thing wherein he had provo∣ked His Majesties displeasure, and did hope that he was clear from that Judgment by the Kings Commission in ma∣king him General of the Voyage to</HI> Guiana; <HI>For,</HI> as he conceived, <HI>the words,</HI> to his trusty and well beloved Subject, &amp;c. <HI>did in themselves imply a pardon;</HI> But the Attorney General told him, these words were not sufficient for that purpose; whereupon he desired the opinion of the Court; To which the Lord Chief Ju∣stice replyed, <HI>That it was no pardon in Law;</HI> Then be∣gan Sir <HI>Walter</HI> to give an account of his Voyage; but was interrupted by the Lord Chief Justice, who told him, <HI>That it was not for any offence committed there, but for his first Fact that he was now called in question,</HI> and thereupon told him, <HI>That seeing he must prepare to dye, he would not add to his affliction, nor aggravate his crime, knowing him to be a man full of misery, but with the good</HI> Samaritane, <HI>would administer Wine and Oyl for the com∣fort of his distressed Soul; You have been,</HI> said he, <HI>a Ge∣neral, and a great Commander, imitate therefore that No∣ble Captain, who thrusting himself into the midst of a bat∣tle, cryed out aloud;</HI> Mors me expectat, &amp; ego Mortem expectabo, Death expects me, and I will expect Death. <HI>As you should not contemn, so neither should you fear death, the one shews too much boldness, the other no less cowardice;</HI> So with some few other Instructions,
<PB N="171" REF="88"/>
the Court arose, and Sir <HI>Walter</HI> was committed into the hands of the Sheriff of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> who present∣ly conveyed him to the <HI>Gate-House</HI> in <HI>Westminster;</HI></P>
<P>Yet it has been much wondred at, how that old sentence which had lain dormant 16 years and up∣ward, against Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> could be now made use of to take off his head afterward; Considering that the then Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon</HI> told him positively; (as Sir <HI>Walter</HI> was acquainting him that he could procure his pardon for a less sum of money, then his <HI>Guiana</HI> preparations amounted to) <HI>Sir</HI> said he, <HI>the Knee-tim∣ber of your Voyage is money, spare your Purse in this parti∣cular, for upon my life you have a sufficient pardon for all that is passed already, the King having under his</HI> Broad-Seal made you Admiral of <HI>your Fleet, and given you power of Martial Law, over the Officers and Souldiers;</HI> It was then likewise the opinion of many Lawyers, that he who by His Majesties Patent had power of Life and Death over the Kings Leige People, should be esteemed or Judged <HI>Rectus in curia,</HI> and free from all Old Convictions.</P>
<P>Upon Thursday <HI>October</HI> 29. 1618. This couragi∣ous Knight was brought before the Parliament House in the Old Pallace Yard <HI>Westminster,</HI> where a Scaffold was erected for his beheading, though it was report∣ed over night that he should be hanged; His Attire was a wrought Night-cap, a Ruff band, a hair colour∣ed Sattin Doublet, with a black wrought Wastcoat under it, a pair of black cut Taffety breeches, Ash-coloured silk Stockins, and a wrought black Velvet Night-gown; His first appearance on the Scaffold was with a smiling Countenance, saluting the Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, with others of his acquaintance there present, when after Proclamation of silence by an Officer, he addressed himself to speak in this man∣ner. <Q>I desire to be born withal, because this is the third day of my Feaver, And if I shew any weak∣ness, I beseech you attribute it to my Malady, for this is the hour I look for it;</Q> Then pausing a while
<PB N="172" REF="89"/>
directing himself toward a Window where the Lords <HI>Arundel, Doncaster,</HI> and other Lords and Knights sate, he with a loud voice spake as followeth; <Q>I thank God of his infinite goodness that he hath sent me to dye in the sight of so honourable an Assembly, and not in darkness;</Q> But by reason the place where they sate was some distance from the Scaffold, that they could not easily hear him, he said; <Q>I will strain my self, for I would willingly have your Honours hear me; The Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> answered, we will come upon the Scaffold;</Q> where after he had saluted eve∣ry one of them severally, he proceeded as follow∣eth.</P>
<P><Q>My Honourable Lords, and the rest of my good Friends who come to see me dye; I thank my God heartily, that he hath brought me into the light to dye, and not suffered me to dye in the dark Prison of the Tower, where I have suffered a great deal of Adversity, and a long sickness, and I thank God that my Feaver hath not taken me at this time, as I prayed God it might not; There are two main points of suspition that his Majesty hath conceived against me, wherein he cannot be satisfied, which I desire to clear, and resolve you in; First, That I had a Plot with <HI>France,</HI> His Majesty had some cause, though grounded upon a weak Foundation, to sus∣pect mine inclination to the <HI>French Faction,</HI> for not long before my departure from <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Agent took occasion passing by my house to visit me, and had some conference during the time of his a∣boad, only concerning my Voyage, and nothing else, I take God to witness; Though it was report∣ed I had a Commission from the King of <HI>France;</HI> But this I say, for a man to call God to witness to a falshood at any time is a grievous sin, and what shall he hope for at the Tribunal of the day of Judg∣ment? But to call God to witness to a falshood at the time of death, is far more grievous and impious, and there is no hope for such a one; And what
<PB N="173" REF="89"/>
should I expect that am now going to render an ac∣count of my Faith, I do therefore call the Lord to witness, as I hope to be saved, and as I hope to see him in his Kingdom, which will be within a quarter of an hour, I never had any Commission from the King of <HI>France,</HI> nor any Treaty with the <HI>French</HI> Agent, nor with any other from the <HI>French</HI> King, neither knew I that there was an Agent, nor what he was, till I met him in my Gallery at my lodging, unlookt for; If I speak not true, O Lord let me not come into thy Kingdom; I cannot deny that when I came back from <HI>Guiana,</HI> being come to <HI>Plymouth</HI> I endeavoured to go to <HI>Rochel,</HI> which was, because I would fain have made my Peace before I came to <HI>England,</HI> having heard a rumor, that there was no hope of my life upon my return to <HI>London,</HI> I would have escaped for the safe-guard of my life, and not for any ill intent, or conspiracy against the State.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The second suspition was, that his Majesty hath been informed I should speak dishonourably and dis∣loyally of him, there is no witness against me but only one Mimical <HI>Frenchman,</HI> whom I entertained rather for his Jests than his Judgment; His way was to incroach himself into the favour of the Lords, and gaping after some great reward, hath falsly ac∣cused me of seditious speeches against His Majesty, against whom if I did either speak or think a thought hurtful or prejudicial, the Lord blot me out of the Book of Life. But in this now what have I to do with Kings? I have nothing to do with them, nei∣ther do I fear them; I have now to do with God, therefore to tell a Lye now, to get the favour of the King were in vain; It is not a time to flatter nor fear Princes, for I am subject to none but <HI>death,</HI> there∣fore have a charitable opinion of me, and think me not now rashly or untruly to confirm or protest any thing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Another suspition arose of me, in that I perswa∣ded Sir <HI>Levves Steukly</HI> my Guardian to flee with me
<PB N="174" REF="90"/>
from <HI>London to France,</HI> but my answer to this is as to the other, that only for my safeguard, and nothing else was my intent, as I shall answer before the Al∣mighty; It is alledged that I feigned my self sick, and by Art made my body full of blisters at <HI>Salisbury;</HI> True it is, I did so, the reason was, because I ho∣ped thereby to defer my coming before the King and Council, and so by delaying might have got time to have gained my pardon; I have an exam∣ple out of Scripture for my Warrant; The Pro∣phet <HI>David</HI> in case of necessity, and for the safe∣guard of his life, feigned himself foolish and mad, yet it was not imputed to him for sin. As for other Objections, that I was brought by force into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that I carried Sixteen Thousand Pounds in money out of <HI>England</HI> with me, more than I made known; That I should recieve Letters from the French King, and such like;</Q> He with many Prote∣stations utterly denyed it; Concluding thus, <Q>And now I intreat you all to join with me in Prayer, that the great God of Heaven whom I have grie∣vously offended, being a man full of all vanity, and have lived a sinful life in all sinful callings, having been a Souldier, a Captain, a Sea Captain, and a Courtier, which are all places of wickedness and vice; That God I say would forgive me, and cast away my sins from me, and that he would recieve me into Everlasting Life, and so I take my leave of you all, making my peace with God.</Q></P>
<P>Then Proclamation being made that all men should depart the Scaffold, he prepared himself for death, giving away his hat, and wrought night-cap, and some money to such as he knew that stood near him, taking his leave of the Lords, Knights, and other Gentlemen, and thanking the Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> for his Company, intreating him to desire the King, <HI>That no scandalous Writing to defame him might be published after his death;</HI> adding, <HI>I have a long Journey to go, and therefore will take my leave;</HI> Then putting off his Gown
<PB N="175" REF="90"/>
and Doublet, he called to the Headsman to shew him the Axe, which being not presently done, he said, <HI>Prithee let me see it, dost thou think that I am afraid of it,</HI> and having it in his hands, he felt along upon the edg of it, and smiling, spake to the Sheriff, saying, <HI>This is a sharp Medicine, but it is a Physician for all di∣seases;</HI> Then going to and fro upon the Scaffold on every side, he prayed the company to pray to God to assist, and strengthen him; Being asked on which side of the block he would lay himself, he replyed, <HI>So the heart be right, it is no matter which way the head lyeth,</HI> and then praying, after he had forgiven the Executioner, having given him a sign when he should do his Office, at two blows he lost both head and life, his body never shrinking nor moving; His Head was shewn on each side the Scaffold, and then put into a Red Leather Bag, and his wrought Velvet Gown thrown over it; which was afterward convey∣ed away in a mourning Coach of his Ladies; The large effusion of blood which proceeded from his Loins amazed the Spectators, who judged that he had a stock of nature sufficient to have lived much longer, though now near 80 years old. He behaved himself at his death with so high, and so Religious a resolution, as if a Christian had acted a <HI>Roman,</HI> or ra∣ther a <HI>Roman</HI> a Christian, and by the Magnanimity which was then conspicuous in him, he abundantly bafled their Calumnies who had accused him of Athe∣ism. Various were the resentments of his death, and several Pasquils, as it always happens on such oc∣casions, were scattered abroad, of the gallantry of his behaviour on the Scaffold, these following Verses may give a confirmation, and a tast of the Poetry of those times,
<Q><L>Great heart! who taught thee so to dye?</L>

<P N="94">XLIV. Mr. <HI>Howel</HI> in his <HI>Epistles</HI> relates the following pleasant Accident, which may be not ungrateful after the former Tragical Account; When the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> was in <HI>Brussels,</HI> about the beginning of the Tumults in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> he sate down before <HI>Hulst</HI> in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> there was a Provost Marshal in his Army, who was a Favorite of his; this Provost had put some to death by secret Commission from the Duke; There was one Captain <HI>Bolea</HI> who was an intimate Freind of the Provosts; one Evening late, the Provost went to the Captains Tent, accompanied with a Confessor and an Executioner, as his Custom was; and coming into his Presence, told the Captain, <HI>That he was come to execute the Dukes Commission, and Martial Law upon him;</HI> The Captain suddenly started up, so struck with a∣mazement that his hair seemed to stand an end, ask∣ing him, <HI>wherein have I offended the Duke;</HI> The Provost replyed <HI>Sir I am not to expostulate the business with you, but to execute my Commission, therefore pray prepare your self, for here's your Ghostly Father, and your Executioner;</HI> The Captain hereupon fell on his knees before the Preist, and having finished his Confession, the Hangman was going to put the Halter about his Neck, but the Provost threw it away, and breaking out into a Laughter told him. <HI>There was no such thing, &amp; that he had done this only to try his Courage, how he could bear the Terror of Death;</HI> The Captain looked ghastly upon him, and said, <HI>Then Sir get you out of my Tent, for you have done me a very ill Office;</HI> The next morning Captain <HI>Bolea,</HI> though a young Man about thirty, had his hair all turned Gray to the admiration of all the World; the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> questioned him about it, but he would confess nothing; The next year the Duke was recalled, and in his Journey to the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> he was to pass by <HI>Saragossa,</HI> and this Cap∣tain
<PB N="178" REF="92"/>
<HI>Bolea</HI> and the Provost went along with him as his Domestick Attendants; The Duke being to repose some days in <HI>Saragossa,</HI> the young old Captain <HI>Bolea</HI> told him; <HI>That there was a thing in that Town worthy to seen of his Excellency which was a</HI> Casa de Loco▪ <HI>a</HI> Bed∣lam-House, <HI>for there was not the like in Christendom; Well</HI> said the Duke, <HI>Go and tell the Warden I will be there to morrow in the afternoon.</HI> The Captain having obtained this, went to the Warden, and told him the Dukes Intention, and that the cheif occasion which moved him to it, was because he had an unruly Pro∣vost about him, who was oft-times subject to Fits of Frenzy, and because he wished him well, he had tried divers means to cure him, but all would not do, therefore he was resolved to try whether keeping him close in <HI>Bedlam</HI> for some days would do him any good; The next day the Duke came with a ruffling Train of Captains after him, amongst whom was the Provost ve∣ry shining brave; Captain <HI>Bolea</HI> told the Warden, point∣ing to the Provost, <HI>That's the man,</HI> whereupon he took him aside into a Dark Lobby, where he had plac'd some of his men, who muffled him in his Cloke, seized upon his Sword, and so hurried him down into a Dungeon; The Provost lay there two nights and a day, after which it happened, that a Gentleman coming out of Curiosity to see the House, peeped into a small Grate where the Provost was; The Provost conjured him as a Christian to go and tell the Duke of <HI>Alva, That his Provost was there clapt up, nor could he imagine why;</HI> The Gentleman did his Errand, and the Duke being astonished, sent for the Warden, and his Prisoner; Hereupon the Provost was brought in <HI>Cuerpo,</HI> full of Straws and Feathers, Mad-man like, before the Duke, who at the sight of him breaking into a Laughter, asked the Warden, why he had made him a Prisoner; <HI>Sir,</HI> said the Warden, <HI>it was by Virtue of your Excellen∣cies Commission brought me by Captain</HI> Bolea, <HI>Bolea</HI> stept forth and told the Duke, <HI>Sir, you have often asked me how these hairs of mine grew so suddenly Grey; I have not

The Country of</HI> Putten <HI>at present Prisoner in the</HI> Voor∣poort, <HI>together with his Examination and Confession, and the Allegations of the several Witnesses, declare the said Prisoner to have forfeited all his Dignities and Imployments, which he hath hitherto possest; and banish him out of the Provinces of</HI> Holland and Westfriezland, <HI>never to re∣turn into the same on pain of greater punishment; And that he accordingly quit the said Countreys with the first, and farther condemn him in the charges of his Tryal;</HI> Actum <HI>by the Lords</HI> Adriaen Pauw <HI>Lord of</HI> Bennebrock, <HI>Pre∣sident,</HI> Aelbrecht Nierox, William Goes <HI>Lord of</HI> Bo∣ekhorstenburg, Frederick <HI>of</HI> Lieu, <HI>Lord of</HI> Zoeter∣meer, Cornelis Baen, and Matheus Gool, <HI>Counsellors of</HI> Holland and Westfriezland, <HI>pronounced in the</HI> Voor∣poort <HI>Gate of the same Court.</HI> August the 20th. 1672.</P>
<P>Before this sentence was published, the Barbar <HI>Ti∣chelaar</HI> being released out of Prison, reported through the Town, <HI>That he was the Person who had accused the</HI> Ruwart, <HI>who was banished for ever, when he as they might all see was set at liberty;</HI> Immediately after this, the sentence being Published, occasioned great mur∣murings amongst the Burgers, who judged it to be unjust; since they saw the Barber was set at liberty, and that consequently his Accusation against the <HI>Ru∣wart</HI> must be real, which if it had been false, the Bar∣ber would undoubtedly have been punished, and the <HI>Ruwart van putten</HI> released; upon which they argu∣ed, that it appeared plainly, that the <HI>Ruwart</HI> had sufficient knowledge of the Treason plotted against the Person of His Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and therefore had justly forfeited his Life, and deserved to dye; The late Council Pentionary, Mr. <HI>John de Wit,</HI> coming the same day with his Coach and two Horses to fetch his Brother <HI>Rewart</HI> out of Prison, he was no sooner alighted, and gone in, but the Burgers caused his Coach to drive away; About 11 a Clock the two Brothers coming down to take Coach, the Watch threatning to fire their Musquets on them,
<PB N="183" REF="94"/>
forced them to retire into the Prison again; Mean while the body of the Watch came to their Centi∣nels Assistance, and beating an Alarum, in a short time raised six Companies of Burgers, two whereof placed themselves round about, and before the Pri∣son Gate, the rest were drawn out on the outward Court, while the three Troops of Horse, which were quartered in the <HI>Hague</HI> immediately mounted, and one of them repaired to their appointed Station; while the other two riding to the Burgers, desired to pass through the Gate, which they refused, stopping them with their Pikes from going farther; At this time it was reported, that the Bores were coming in great numbers from several places to plander the <HI>Hague;</HI> Whereupon all the Horse were sent to the Drawbridges and Trenches about the Town, to op∣pose all outward Assaults, but all this came to no∣thing;</P>
<P>About six a Clock in the Evening the Burgers which guarded the Prison Gate, resolved to open the same by force, and take out the two brothers, they being jealous that either by subtle stratagem or vio∣lence they would be fetched from thence the approach∣ing night; Whereupon they began to discharge their Muskets against the door of the Prison; which not opening, they fetcht great Hammers and Chissels, and therewith broke open the doors and locks; be∣ing entred, several of them ran up stairs, and com∣ing into the Chamber, they found <HI>Ruwart</HI> in his <HI>Ja∣pan</HI> Night-Gown lying on his Bed, and the Council Pentionary his Brother sitting at the Beds feet, read∣ing in a book, which laying aside, he asked the Bur∣gers, <HI>what this violence meant? and what they would have?</HI> To which no other answer was made, but that they must both of them go down; Hereupon they pulled <HI>Ruwart</HI> from the Bed, not suffering him to put on any more cloaths, but with bitter Curses and Excla∣mations pushed them down st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irs, in such a violent manner that one of the Burgers wounded. <HI>John de Wit</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="95"/>
in the Forehead with his Pike; No sooner were they come out into the Street, but the multitude fell a kicking and striking of them, resolving to carry them to the Scaffold, either there to shoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, or put them to a more cruel death; as indeed it soon hap∣pened; For some who could nor stay their furious and bloody hands so long. First knocked down <HI>Ru∣wart Van Putten,</HI> whilst aboue five or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ces from thence, <HI>John de Wit</HI> recieved a blow on his Forehead with the But end of a Musket and fell likewise down on the ground but being not quite dead, he was shot through the head with a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ol, which made him give up the Ghost; <HI>Ruwart</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mean time was stabbed in the body with several swords; After which both their bodies having recieved several wounds, as well by Musket shots as otherwise; The rude multitude broke in among the Burgers, tearing their cloaths from their dead bodies, and dragged them naked by the Legs along the Streets to the Scaffold, where <HI>Rewart</HI> not being quite dead breathed his last.</P>
<P>The Bodies thus m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngled were hung up by the feet on a Gibbet, where they were kickt and spit on. On this bloody Stage, the last part of this Tragedy was Acted, by several inhumane, and most barbarous people, who first pluckt off the hair from the heads of their Massacred Bodies, beat the Teeth out of their Mouths, pulled out their Tongues, cut off their Ears, Noses, and Privy parts, chopped off their Fin∣gers and Toes, and that with such Hellish Oaths and Curses as were never before heard of; But this not sufficing, they ript up their Breasts and Bellies, tore out their Hearts and Bowels, so that their Bodies had more resemblance to slaughtered Beasts, than of men; At last, the darkness of the night ended this horri∣ble Tragedy, and all returned to their several Habi∣tations; The bodies were by some certain persons, who came in disguize, taken from the Gibbet, carry∣ed home, and some days after privately buried, while the Members of the slain are sold up and down

<P N="99">XCIX. To divert the Reader after this lamentable story, I will here insert the famous Relation of the <HI>Ephesian</HI> Matron, as it is written by <HI>Petronius,</HI> and di∣vers other remarkable Authors. There was a Ma∣tron in <HI>Ephesus</HI> of so noted a chastity, that the Wo∣men of the neighbouring parts flocked thither to be∣hold her; She when she buried her Husband, was not content with the common usages to follow the Herse with dischevelled hair, or in the sight of the Assist∣ants to beat upon her bare breasts, but she also fol∣lowed the deceased into the very Monument, and ha∣ving seen it laid there in its peculiar apartment, after the <HI>Greek</HI> manner, she remained there to keep the Body, and to lament it for whole nights and days to∣gether; Her Parents nor Kindred could not prevail to get her away, and the Magistrates themselves ha∣ving in vain attempted it, departed from her: All men bewailed a woman of so singular an example, and it was the fifth day since she had tasted any food; Her faithful Maid sate by her mournful Mistriss, and when her own tears were spent, lent her others, re∣pairing also the light of the Monument, as oft as it required it; She was therefore the only discourse of the City, and it was confessed by all men, that she was the only true and most illustrious example of Conjugal Chastity and Love; In the mean time the Governour of the Province had commanded, that certain Thieves should be Crucified near to that very Dormitory, where the Matron lamented her lately departed Husband; The next night therefore the Souldier (that was set to guard the Gibbets, least any should steal the Bodies thence, and bury them) per∣cieving a clear light amongst the Monuments, and hearing the sighs of some Mourner, in a curiosity
<PB N="186" REF="96"/>
that is incident to Humane Nature, he was desirous to know who was there, and what they did; He there∣upon descends into the Monument, where beholding a most beautiful Woman, at first sight he stood im∣moveable; Soon after espying the dead body, con∣sidering her Tears, and those injuries she had done to her Face with her Nails, judging of the matter as it was, that the Woman was not able to bear the death of her Husband; He went and fetch'd his Supper in∣to the Monument; and began to exhort the Mourner that she would not persist in a vain Greif, or distend her heart with unprofitable sighs; He represented, <HI>that the same Fate waited upon them all, that all must come at last to that long home;</HI> and spake such other things as serve to appease such Hearts as are exasperat∣ed with Greif; But she wounded with unknown Sor∣row, rent her Breasts with greater Vehemence, and pulling off her hair threw it on the breast of her de∣ceased Husband which lay before her; Notwithstand∣ing all which, the Souldier left not the place, but with the same Exhortations, attempted to bring the Wo∣man to the tast of some Food; At last the Maid (cor∣rupted 'tis likely by the Odour of the Wine) reach∣ed out her Conquered hand to receive the Humanity of him that invited her, and having refreshed her self with meat and drink, she began to attempt upon the obstinacy of her Mistriss; <HI>What,</HI> said she, <HI>will it ad∣vantage you if you shall perish with Famine, if you shall bu∣ry your self alive, if you shall render up your uncondemned breath before your appointed time,</HI></P>

No Person is unwilling to hear, when they are ad∣vised to save their Lives, and therefore the Lady be∣ing dry with several days abstinence, suffered her Ob∣stinacy to be prevail'd upon, and filled her self with meat as greedily as her Maid had done before; But with the same Blandishments wherewith the Souldi∣er had prevailed with the Matron to live, with the same he attempts her Chastity also; The young Man seemed to this chast One, neither unhandsom nor un∣eloquent and the Maid too seeking to get him into her favour repeated ever and anon;

<P>To be short, the woman abstained not from any kind of Familiarity, the victorious Souldier overcame, and they lay together not only that night, but the next and a third after; The entrance of the Monument being closed, that it might be supposed the most chast Woman had expired upon the Corps of her Husband. But the Souldier delighted with the Beauty of the Woman, and also with the Privacy, bought what he was able, and at the entrance of the night brought it to the Monument, where he continued till Morning; The Parents therefore of one of the Thieves lately executed, perceiving how slightly the Bodies were guarded, took down their Son from the Gallows, and committed him to the Earth; But the Souldier in the Morning perceiving that one of the Gibbets was with∣out its Carcass, and fearing the punishment of his neg∣lect, told the Woman what had happened, and withal that he would not expect the Sentence, but would punish himself for his neglect with his own sword, be∣seeching her to afford him a place for Burial, and to make a fatal Repository for her Friend as well as for her Husband; The Woman, no less compassionate than chast, cryes out, <HI>Certainly</HI> said she, <HI>the Heavens will not suffer that at the same time I should behold the Funerals of

Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> had a Design to reduce them all to a Kingdom, which his Son <HI>Philip</HI> the second likewise attempted, but could never Effect, because of the multiplicity and difference of their Rights, Priviledges and Immuni∣ties, which could not possibly be reduced under one Monarchy; <HI>Philip</HI> the second at his Inauguration into these Provinces was sworn to observe these Rights, and at his departure for <HI>Spain</HI> obliged himself by an Oath, still to send one of his own bloud to Govern them; Moreover at the request of the Knights of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> he promised that all Forreign Souldiers should be removed, and that he himself would come to visit them once in every seventh year; But being once gone, and leaving instead of a <HI>Sword,</HI> a <HI>Distaff,</HI> or unweildy Woman to Govern them, He not only broke his promise with them, but procured a Dispen∣sation from the Pope to be absolved and freed from his Oath, and all this by the Council of the Cardinal <HI>Granvil,</HI> who (as the <HI>States</HI> Chronicler writes) was the first Firebrand who kindled that lamentable and long War, wherein the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> traded above

fifty years in bloud; For intending, <HI>To increase the number of Bishops, To establish the Decrees of the Council of</HI> Trent, <HI>and to destroy the Power of the Council of State, composed of the Natives of the Land, by making it appeal∣able to the Council of</HI> Spain, <HI>and by adding to the former Oath of Allegiance many particulars for settling the Bloudy</HI> Spanish <HI>Inquisition and curbing their Consciences in matters of Religion.</HI> These harsh, unreasonable and Illegal Invasions upon their Civil and Religious Rights and Liberties, were the first occasions of those dreadful Broyls and Devastations which after happened.</P>
<P>To appease which, Ambassadors were dispatched to <HI>Spain</HI> from the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> whereof the two first came to violent Deaths, the one being beheaded, and the other poysoned, but the two last, Count <HI>Egmond</HI> and <HI>Horn</HI> were still fed with false hopes, till <HI>Philip</HI> the second had prepared an Army under the Conduct of the D. of <HI>Alva,</HI> to compose the difference by Arms; For as soon as he came to the Government, he esta∣blished the <HI>Bloet-Rad</HI> (as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> termed it) or <HI>Council of Bloud,</HI> made up most of <HI>Spaniards;</HI> Count <HI>Egmond</HI> and <HI>Horn</HI> were apprehended, and afterward Beheaded; Citadels were erected, and the Oath of Allegiance, with the Political Government of the Countrey in divers things altered. This powered Oil on the Fire formerly kindled, and put all in Combu∣stion. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> retires, thereupon his eldest Son was surprized, and sent as Hostage into <HI>Spain,</HI> and above 5000 Families leave the Countrey; Many Towns revolted which were afterward reduced to obedience; which made the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> say; <HI>That the</HI> Netherlands <HI>belonged to the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>not only by Descent, but Conquest;</HI> After this he attempted to impose the Tenth Penny, for maintenance of the Garrisons in the Citadels he had erected at <HI>Grave, Ʋ∣tretcht,</HI> and <HI>Antwerp</HI> (where he caused his Statue made of Canon Brass to be erected, trampling the <HI>Belgians</HI> under his Feet) but all the Towns withstood this Imposition, so that at last matters succeeding ill with

him, and having had his dear Friend <HI>Pacecio</HI> hanged at the Gates of <HI>Flushing,</HI> after he had likewise traced out the Platform of a Citadel in that Town, he was recalled back to <HI>Spain; Don Lewes de Requiseus</HI> succee∣ded him, who came short of his Predecessors Exploits, and dying suddenly in the Feild, the Government was invested for the time in the <HI>Council of State.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers being without a Head, ga∣thered together to the number of 1600, and commit∣ted such Outrages up and down, that they were Pro∣claimed Enemies to the State, hereupon the Pacifica∣tion at <HI>Gaunt</HI> was Transacted, one Article whereof was, <HI>That all Forreign Souldiers should quit the Countrey;</HI> This was ratified by the King, and observed by <HI>Don John of Austria</HI> who succeeded in the Government; yet <HI>Don John</HI> retained the <HI>Lands-Knights</HI> still, as some thought for Invading <HI>England;</HI> He kept the <HI>Spaniards</HI> also hover∣ing about the Frontiers for all occasions. Certain Letters were intercepted which made a Discovery of some Pro∣jects, and caused the War to bleed afresh; <HI>Don John</HI> was hereupon proclaimed an Enemy to the State, and the Arch-Duke <HI>Matthias</HI> was sent for, who being a Man of small Performance, and improper for the Times, was dismist, but upon Honourable Terms; <HI>Don John</HI> soon after dyes, some said of the Pox, then comes in the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> a man as of a different Nation, (being an <HI>Italian,</HI>) so of a differing Temper, and more Moderate Spirit, and of greater performance than all the rest, reducing several Cities and great Towns to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Obedience; He had threescore Thousand Men in Pay, the choicest which <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> could afford. At this time the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Ambassadors interceding for a Peace, had a short answer of King <HI>Philip</HI> the second, who said, <HI>That he needed not the help of any to reconcile himself to his own Subjects, and reduce them to Conformity, but what difference there was, he would refer to his Cosen the Emperor;</HI> Here∣upon the business was Treated at <HI>Colen,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniard</HI> stood as high a Tiptoe as ever, and notwith∣standing the vast expence of Bloud and Treasure he

<P>Hereupon the States perceiving that King <HI>Philip</HI> could not be wrought either by the solicitations of other Princes, or their own supplications so often re∣peated, <HI>That they might enjoy the Freedom of Religion, with other Civil Rights, Freedoms, and Infranchisements, to which he was obliged by Oath;</HI> being provoked like∣wise by that <HI>Ban</HI> or <HI>Proclamation,</HI> which was published against the Prince of <HI>Orange, That whosoever killed him should have</HI> 5000 <HI>Crowns,</HI> They at last absolutely re∣nounced and abjured the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for their So∣veraign; They broke his Seals, changed the Oath of Allegiance, and fled into <HI>France</HI> for Succour; They set up the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> (recommended to them by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to whom he was a Suitor) for their Prince; who attempted to render himself Absolute, and so thought to surprize <HI>Antwerp,</HI> but received there an ill-favoured repulse; Yet nevertheless the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> (for so they termed themselves ever after,) fearing to distast their next great Neighbour <HI>France,</HI> made a second Offer to that King, <HI>To desire his Protection and Soveraignty;</HI> But he had too many Irons in the Fire at home, the <HI>Ʋnholy League</HI> growing daily stronger against him, he therefore answered them, <HI>That his Shirt was nearer to him than his Doublet;</HI> Then had they recourse to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who partly for her own Security, and partly for Interest in Religion reacht them a supporting hand, and sent them Men, Money, and the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> for their Governour, who not agreeing with their Humor, was soon recal∣led, without any outward dislike on the Queens side, for she left her Forces still with them, but upon their Expence; She lent them afterward some Considerable Sums of Money, and received the Towns of <HI>Brill</HI>

and <HI>Flushing</HI> for her Security, and ever after the <HI>English</HI> were the best Sinews of their War, and the Atcheivers of the greatest exploits among them.</P>
<P>Having thus made sure of the <HI>English;</HI> they held the <HI>Spaniard</HI> tack many years, and during those Tra∣verses of War were very Fortunate against him; At last a Treaty of Peace was propounded, which the <HI>States</HI> or seven <HI>Provinces</HI> would not agree to sin∣gly with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> unless the Provinces that yet remained under him would engage themselves to the performance of the Articles, besides they would not Treat either of Peace or Truce, unless they were declared <HI>Free-States,</HI> and Treated by the Title of <HI>The High and Mighty States of the Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> all which was granted, and so a Truce was Concluded, which ended in a Peace that has continued without any considerable Interruption even to this day; These Wars did much drain and impoverish the King of <HI>Spain</HI> by reason of the distance from thence to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> for every Souldier that he sent from <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> cost him near an Hundred Crowns before he came into <HI>Flanders;</HI> So that not∣withstanding his Silver and Gold Mines of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> it plunged him deeply in debt, insomuch that having taken up moneys in all the chief Banks of <HI>Christendom,</HI> he was forced to dispense with himself from Payment by a Declaration published to that pur∣pose, alledging, <HI>That he could not pay it, having imploy∣ed those moneys,</HI> as he said, <HI>for the Publick Peace of</HI> Chri∣stendom; This broke many great Bankers, and his Credit was not good in his own Towns of <HI>Sevil</HI> and <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and which was worse, while he was thus wrestling with his own Subjects, the <HI>Turks</HI> took the Opportunity to seize the two strong Forts of <HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Goletta</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> which were the Trophies of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth his Father.</P>
<P>So eager was he in this Quarrel, that he employed the utmost of his strength and Industry to reduce this People to his Will, in regard he had an Intent to

make these Provinces his Main Rendevouz, and Ma∣gazine of Men of War, which his Neighbours perceiv∣ing, and that he had an Aim to be a <HI>Western Monarch,</HI> they stuck close to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> not so much, it may be, out of Love, as Reasons of State; and this was that Bone which Secretary <HI>Walsingham</HI> told Q. <HI>Elizabeth, he would cast to the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>that should last him twenty years, and perhaps make his Teeth shake in his head;</HI> And so it happened, for it was said, <HI>That he might have paved the Streets of</HI> Madrid <HI>with Silver, and covered the Houses thereof with Gold, with the money that he spent in the Wars of the</HI> Netherlands. Thus this great Prince by embracing violent and unreasonable Counsels, and endeavouring to deprive his Subjects of their Liber∣ties, contrary to the Obligations of Honour and Con∣science, was unfortunate in all his Enterprizes; and at last obliged to acknowledge them, who were willing to have been his Subjects, to be as it were his Equals and Competitors. <HI>Howels Letters, pag.</HI> 81.</P>
<P N="102">CII. The Adventures and Dangers of Mr. <HI>John Watts</HI> are no less remarkable than any yet mentioned, which are related by himself, as followeth, This <HI>John Watts</HI> being about 18 years of Age, shipt himself at <HI>Deal</HI> in the <HI>Peachtree</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> of about 60 Tun in <HI>June</HI> 1668; The Ship had not been long in the <HI>Downes</HI> but a fair Gale presenting, they hoisted Sail; The first place they touched at was the <HI>Gold Coast,</HI> and from thence they went to <HI>Old Calabar,</HI> in the <HI>Bith</HI> of <HI>Guinney;</HI> They entred a River called <HI>Cross</HI> River into <HI>Pirates Island;</HI> After they had taken in their <HI>Negroes</HI> and rea∣dy to Sail, the Master calls up the Boatswain and three men more, whereof <HI>Watts</HI> was one, and commands them to look out the Copper Bars that were left, and carry them on shore to try if they could sell them; The Boatswain with his small Company desired that they might have Arms with them, not believing the common Report, that they were an harmless, Inno∣cent People; They took with them three Muskets and a Pistol, and so rowed toward the shore, but not

far from it, our Match fell unhappily into the Water, and our ship being fallen down from that narrow part of the River nearer the Sea, quite out of our sight, we were consulting what would be safest for us to do, we were not willing voluntarily to destroy our selves, and were ashamed to return to our Ship before we had dispatched our business; At length the Boatswain sent the Relator <HI>John Wats</HI> on shore to the first house to light our Match, that we had recovered out of the Water after it was extinct, which he readily obeyed; But before he was twenty Rods from the Waterside, he was seized on by two Blacks, or rather <HI>Tawny Moors,</HI> and by them haled above half a mile up into the Countrey, and thrown with great violence upon his Belly, and so compelled to lye till they stript him, and more Company coming to them, they were so eager for his poor Canvas Apparel, that some they tore off, others they cut off, and with that several pieces of his Flesh, to his Intolerable pain; with these rags they made little Childrens Aprons to cover their Privities, Linnen and Woollen being very scarce there.</P>
<P>The Boatswain seeing <HI>John Wats</HI> thus carried away, was resolved with his two Companions to have him again, with the venture of their Lives; They Arm themselves; but whilst they were consulting whether to venture on shore or not; of a sudden they were beset with about a Dozen men in several Canoes, but they valiantly maintained their Boat for three hours, for after two or three Musquets were discharged they defended themselves with the Oars and Boathooks; The Boatswain received a mortal wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat; the other two adventured into the River, endeavouring by swiming to escape the merciless hands of Cruel Infidels; But the <HI>Negroes</HI> with their swift Canoes soon overtook them, and brought them on shore to the place where <HI>John Wats</HI> was; The <HI>Negroes</HI> took the Boatswain out of the Ships Boat, and instead of endeavouring to preserve
<PB N="196" REF="101"/>
his life, they presently cut off his head with a sharp weapon before his Companions Faces; and whilst he was yet reeking in his Bloud, they barbarously cut off peices of Flesh from his Buttocks, Thighs, Arms, and Shoulders, and broiling it on the Coals, they with great impatience, eagerly eat it before our faces as a most rare Banquet, to our great terror and astonish∣ment; About fourteen days after, one of the Com∣pany fell sick, but instead of being Physitians to cure him, they were his Butchers to murther him; They served him as they did the Boatswain, cut off his head, and broiled and eat up his flesh, and rejoyced ex∣ceedingly at this pleasant Entertainment; Ten days after the third fell sick, whom they used in the same manner; These dreadful Executions much affected <HI>John Wats,</HI> who expected hourly to taste of the same Cruelty, but through Divine providence, notwith∣standing the Alteration of the Climate, want of Clothes, and the strangeness of the Food which was only Herbs, he continued in good health, and the Natives who daily expected another Banquet were disappointed, either their Customs, or the overruling power of Hea∣ven not suffering them to destroy him while he was well.</P>
<P>His Master therefore resolved to sell him, with whom he was pretty free to discourse, <HI>Wats</HI> having about three years before been in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where he had learned the <HI>Tata</HI> Language, which is easily at∣tained, being comprehended in a very few words, and all the <HI>Negroes</HI> speak it; He desired to know of his Master the reason of their Cruelty, who bid him be satisfied, since unless he were sick he should not have his head cut off. In the Boat with which they went first ashore one Musquet of the three was saved, and had not been discharged, which his Master brought to him to teach him the use of it, which for fear of his Masters displeasure and their inhumanity he en∣deavoured to do, but they still professing their Ig∣norance, he was forced to shoot it off; But the <HI>Negroes</HI>

who expected some delightful thing, being frustra∣ted, and at the sudden noise and flash of fire, which they very much dread, fled from him greatly affright∣ed; yet soon after, hearing no more of that noise, they came up to him again, commanding him to do the like; He told them, he had not Powder which was the cause of the noise, but this would not satis∣fie these <HI>Barbarians;</HI> and therefore thinking it wilful∣ness, they would have murthered him, had not his Master rescued him; After this, in discourse with his Master, he told him, <HI>That naturally the people were civil, and simply honest, but if provoked, full of revenge; and that this their barbarous dealing was occasioned by some unhandsome action, of carrying a Native away from thence without their leave about a year before, they resolv∣ing if any came on shore, they should never go off alive.</HI></P>
<P>About 7 weeks after <HI>Wats</HI> had been in the Coun∣try, his Master presented him to his King, named <HI>Efnme</HI> King of the <HI>Buckamores,</HI> who immediately gave him to his Daughter, called <HI>Onijah;</HI> when the King went abroad, he attended him as his Page, through∣out the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above 12 Miles, yet he boasted extreamly of his Power and Strength, glorying exceedingly that he had a <HI>White Man</HI> to attend him, whom he imployed to carry his Bow and Arrows; In several places far from the Seaside, the people would run away from him for fear, others would fall down, and seem to worship him, using those Actions as they do to their Gods; Their progress was never so long, but they could return home at night, but never without a handsome load of a cup of the Creature; for he sel∣dom or never went abroad, and came home sober; Their drink is of the best <HI>Palm</HI> Wine, and another sort of strong Liquor called <HI>Penrore; Wats</HI> knew quickly how to humour this profound Prince, and if any of the Natives abused him, upon his complaint he had Redress, as once by striving with a <HI>Negro,</HI> his Arm was broke, which by Providence more than
<PB N="198" REF="102"/>
skill was set again. After some Months, the King of <HI>Calamanch,</HI> whose name was <HI>Esn mancha,</HI> hearing of this beautiful <HI>White,</HI> Courted his Neighbour Prince to sell him to him; at length they struck a bargain, and <HI>Wats</HI> was sold for a Cow, and a Goat.</P>
<P>This King was a very sober and moderate person, free from the treacheries and mischiefs that the other was subject to; He would often discourse <HI>Wats,</HI> and ask him of his King and Country; whether his King∣doms and Dominions were as big as his, which were not above 25 Miles in length, and 15 in breadth; <HI>Wats</HI> told him as much as his understanding and years made him capable of, keeping still within the bounds of modesty, and yet relating as much as pos∣sible to the Honour and Dignity of his Soveraign; First informing him of the greatness of one of his Kingdomes, the several Shires and Counties it con∣tained, with the number of its Cities, Towns and Castles, the strength of each, the infinite Inhabitants and valour of his Subjects; One of these Kingdoms was enough sufficiently to amaze this Petty Gover∣nour, that he had no need to mention any more of His Majesties Glory and Dignity; It put him into such a profound Consternation, that he resolved to find out some way to shew his respects to this Mighty Prince, and told <HI>John Wats, that if he could find but a Passage, he would let him go to</HI> England, <HI>to tell his Ma∣iesty of the great favour and respect he had for him;</HI> Which did not a little rejoyce our <HI>Englishman;</HI> with∣al the King told him; <HI>He would send him a present which should be two Cabareets or Goats,</HI> which they value very highly, the King himself having not above 16 or 18 of them; <HI>Wats</HI> tells the King, <HI>that the King of</HI> Eng∣land <HI>had many Thousands of his Subjects who were under the degree of Gentlemen, that had a Thousand Sheep apeice, the Flesh whereof they valued at a very much higher rate than Goats.</HI></P>
<P>Though our <HI>Englishman</HI> lived very handsomely with this King, yet his desires and hopes were for his
<PB N="199" REF="102"/>
Native Countrey, and at length he obtained a Pro∣mise from his King, <HI>That the first</HI> English <HI>Ship which came into the Road, should have liberty to release or purchase him;</HI> This very much rejoyced his heart, and now he thought every day a year, till he could hear of, or see some <HI>English</HI> Ship arrive, and oft did he walk to the Sea side to receive some comfort; which at length was observed by <HI>Jaga</HI> a Wizard, and the chief∣est in 3 or 4 Kingdoms thereabout; They are per∣sons that the Natives give very much credit to, and on any difficult occasion run to them for satisfaction; And though they have vast numbers of them in eve∣ry place, yet this <HI>Jaga</HI> was the most renowned a∣mongst them; One day he comes to <HI>Wats,</HI> and asked him very civilly, <HI>why he so often frequented that place,</HI> who told him; It was to see if he could discover any <HI>English</HI> Ship to come in there; But <HI>Wats</HI> being unac∣quainted with his great fame, asked him, <HI>when he did believe there would one come in;</HI> Not that he was wil∣ling to give credit to any of their Divinations, but supposing hereby to please him, and answer his ex∣pectation; <HI>Jaga</HI> immediately told him, <HI>That</HI> 15 <HI>days after an</HI> English <HI>Ship should come into that Road;</HI> He then askt him, <HI>whether that Ship should carry him away;</HI> To which he answered very doubtfully, but told him, <HI>He should be offered to the Master of the Ship, and if they did not agree, so that he were brought to shore again; he should not be sold, but would dye for grief.</HI></P>
<P>These 15 days seemed very tedious to <HI>Wats,</HI> who cast many a look on the Sea with an aking heart; The 14th. day he went to the highest Hill therea∣bout, but could discover no Ship; the next morn∣ing he went again 2 or 3 times, but saw none; About 2 or 3 hours after, some <HI>Moors</HI> came running, and told the King there was a <HI>Canoe</HI> coming, for so they called our Ships; At which our <HI>Englishman</HI> rejoyced heartily, in hope of release, yet durst not shew it for fear of Punishment or Death, for though he lived better now than with his first Master, yet his service
<PB N="200" REF="103"/>
was far worse than the slaves in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and their Di∣et worse than Dogs meat; he had therefore cause enough of inward joy; The Ship came immediately in; and <HI>Wats</HI> goes presently to <HI>Jaga,</HI> to know if it were an <HI>English</HI> Ship, who assured him it was; It hap∣pened to be the St. <HI>Malo</HI>'s Merchant, Captain <HI>Royden</HI> Commander, who hastned to dispatch his business, took in his <HI>Negroes,</HI> and was ready to sail, and our <HI>En∣glishman</HI> heard not a word what should become of him, the King never offering to sell him; This made him resolve on an escape, to which end he had prepared a piece of Timber near the waterside, on which he intended to paddle to the Ship, which then lay a∣bout a League from the Shore; Just as he was about to lanch his little floating board, he espied a great <HI>Aligator,</HI> which will devour a man at a mouthful; This made him alter his resolution, and resolve ra∣ther to live with inhumane Infidels, than to throw himself into so imminent a danger; The next day God Almighty opened the heart of the King to let the poor <HI>Englishman</HI> go; He sent him in a <HI>Canoe</HI> pla∣ced betwixt a <HI>Negro</HI>'s Legs, with some others to guide this small Vessel, for fear he should leap overboard, and swim to the Ship.</P>
<P>At a distance from the Ship he haled her in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, which made those aboard much ad∣mire; The <HI>Negroes</HI> gave him leave to stand up, and shew himself to the Captain, to whom he gave an account how four were left there, and he only pre∣served; It was some time before they could bargain, though the Captain was resolved not to leave him be∣hind; Several times the <HI>Negroes</HI> padled away with their Canoe, resolving not to part with him, but with promises and intreaties he perswaded them back to the Ship again, and they delivered him on board for 45 Copper and Iron Bars, the Copper being as big as a Youths little Finger, and the Iron somewhat bigger, now were his Joys compleated, he could hardly per∣swade himself but it was a Dream or Vision, and that

he did not really see <HI>English</HI> faces again, nor imbrace <HI>English</HI> Bodies; It was some time before he could throw himself at the Captains feet, to acknowledge his infinite obligations to him; When he came on board, his Hair was very long, and his Skin tawny, having gone naked all the time he was there, and frequently anointing himself with <HI>Palm</HI> Oyl, he look∣ed like a Tawny <HI>Moor;</HI> But the Seamen aboard, with Christian Hearts soon apparelled him; The Master hoisted Sail for the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> where he was to stay some time, but <HI>Wats</HI> earnestly desiring to see his Na∣tive Countrey, got passage in the <HI>Katherine</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and by the Assistance of Heaven, in a few Weeks safe∣ly arrived in the <HI>Downes,</HI> and was entertained by his Uncle, Mr. <HI>Richard Wats</HI> of <HI>Deal</HI> with great joy, who took this Relation from his own mouth. <HI>Sea Delive∣rances.</HI> Pag. 73.</P>

<P>Thus set forth, he arrives at <HI>Tangier</HI> with an Army of about Thirty Thousand men, where he meets <HI>Mu∣ly Mahamet</HI> with a very small addition of Forces, and much less than he expected, yet he marches forward toward <HI>Abdemelech,</HI> who by Letters in vain, advised him to return in Peace; The 2 Armies meet in the Plains of <HI>Alcazar,</HI> where King <HI>Sebastian</HI> is utterly de∣feated, himself, <HI>Muly Mahamet, Stukely,</HI> and several persons of quality slain; Three Kings fell in this field, for <HI>Abdemelech</HI> was slain in the hottest of the fight; This Battel was fought in <HI>August</HI> 1578, yet some have affirmed that <HI>Sebastian</HI> was not slain in this Battel, but that for shame and sorrow he returned not home, but wandring from one place to another, was at last discovered at <HI>Venice,</HI> and from thence by command of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> was carryed to <HI>Naples,</HI> where he was kept three dayes in a dark and dismal Dungeon, without any sustenance, but a Knife and an Halter, where he miserably dyed.

but all Christendom, during the short time of his Reign, who of right ought, and who probably might succeed King <HI>Henry</HI> in the Kingdom; There were se∣veral pretenders thereunto, but <HI>Catherine</HI> Dutchess of <HI>Braganza,</HI> and youngest Daughter to Don <HI>Edward,</HI> sixth Son of <HI>Emanual</HI> aforementioned, had the cer∣tain and undoubted Right; yet <HI>Philip</HI> 2. King of <HI>Spain</HI> likewise made his claim, though contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, which <HI>Philip</HI> knew very well; but having Power and Might on his side, he little regarded Rights and Titles, thinking them not strong enough against the infallible Arguments of Souldiers, Arms and Money; and therefore no soon∣er did the News of the death of King <HI>Henry</HI> arrive at the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court, but the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> was com∣manded with an Army of Twenty Thousand men to march to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and in the name and right of his Catholick Majesty, to make conquest of that Kingdom if he found opposition.</P>
<P>But little resistance was made, only <HI>Don Antonio</HI> the Bastard, son of <HI>Lewes</HI> the <HI>Infante,</HI> having got into <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in the head of a Tumultuary Rabble, rather than a well formed Army, endeavoured at first to make some defence, but was soon defeated, and the Suburbs of <HI>Lisbon</HI> being plundered to satisfie the Souldiers, the City was surrendred to him; Whither soon after King <HI>Philip</HI> came, and so by a mixt Title of Descent and Arms, took possession of the King∣dom in 1580. <HI>Katherine</HI> Dutchess of <HI>Braganza,</HI> be∣ing inforced to surrender to him all her Interest and Pretensions to that Crown; The Nobility and Peo∣ple of <HI>Portugal</HI> were without doubt extreamly ama∣zed to see themselves so suddenly surprized, and made subject to a Forreign Prince, and especially to a Prince of that Nation against whom they had a na∣tural hatred and antipathy, but finding themselves in a condition not able to make resistance, they thought they should gain more by freely submitting to the King, than to be forced to it; They therefore
<PB N="204" REF="105"/>
made their humble submission, which King <HI>Philip</HI> met as it were half way, and condescended in the Parlia∣ment, or General Assembly of Estates, of that King∣dom, to be sworn to these Articles or Capitulations following.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the said</HI> Philip <HI>King of</HI> Spain, <HI>&amp;c. Should observe all the Laws, Liberties, Priviledges, and Customs granted to the People by the former Kings of</HI> Portugal. 2. <HI>That the Vice King or Governour should be always the Son, Brother, Ʋncle, or Nephew of the King, or else a Native of</HI> Portugal. 3. <HI>That all the Chief Officers in Church or State should be bestowed upon the Natives of</HI> Por∣tugal, <HI>and not upon strangers; Likewise the Governments of all Towns and Places.</HI> 4. <HI>That all Countreys now be∣longing to the</HI> Portugals <HI>should so continue, to the Commo∣dity and benefit of the Nation.</HI> 5. <HI>That the</HI> Portugal <HI>Na∣tion should be admitted to all Offices in the Kings House, as well as the</HI> Spaniards. 6. <HI>That because the King could not conveniently be always in</HI> Portugal, <HI>he should send the Prince to be bred up amongst them.</HI> These Articles were shut up, or concluded, with a Blessing upon such Kings as should observe and keep them, and a curse on those who should break or violate them; And some Authors likewise affirm, that there was another clause added to them signifying, <HI>That in case</HI> (which God forbid) <HI>the King which then was, or his Successors should not observe this Agreement; or should procure a Dis∣pensation for this Oath the Three Estates of the Kingdom might freely deny subjection, and obedience to the King, with∣out being Guilty either of Perjury or Treason.</HI></P>
<P>Though these Articles were thus sworn to, and the Cardinal <HI>Albertus</HI> Archduke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Son to the Emperor, and Nephew to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> appoin∣ted Vice-King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI> durst not yet in Person leave the Kingdom, for he perceived by their Murmurs and visible discontents, that their sub∣mission to him proceeded more out of Fear than Love; and that as he had in a moment gained that Kingdom, so he should as soon lose it, if he gave
<PB N="205" REF="105"/>
them but the least opportunity; For that the People were highly discontented, it did easily appear by their Attentive listening after Old Prophecies, among which was one of an Old Hermit, who told <HI>Alphonso</HI> the First King of <HI>Portugal</HI> of the great Victory he should obtain over the five Kings of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and <HI>That his Posterity should reign happily Kings of</HI> Portugal, <HI>but that in the sixteenth Generation, his Line should fail, but that God at length should have mercy again upon them, and restore them.</HI> Others had regard to a Letter written by St. <HI>Bernard</HI> to the same King <HI>Alphonso,</HI> (the Original of which is reported to have been given to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Ambassador by <HI>Lewis</HI> 13, King of <HI>France</HI> in 1641) the substance whereof was; <HI>That he rendred Thanks to him for the Lands bestowed upon him, and that in recompence thereof, God had declared unto him, that there should not fail a Native of</HI> Portugal <HI>to sit upon the Throne, unless for the greatness of their Sins, God would chastise them for a time, but that this time of Chastisement should not last above threescore years;</HI> Other Prophesies there were of this Nature, and to this Effect, which put the People in hope of a Deliverance, and many flattered them∣selves, that <HI>Don Sebastian</HI> was yet alive, and would come and deliver them; nay so foolish were some of them that though they believed him slain at the Bat∣tle of <HI>Alcazer</HI> in Barbary, yet they thought he should live again, and miraculously come to Redeem them.</P>
<P>But that which most of all exprest the Peoples discontents, was what was publickly spoken by the Mouths of their Orators the Priests in their Pulpits, who would ordinarily in their Sermons utter Speeches much to the prejudice of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Title, and in Favour of the Dutchess of <HI>Braganza,</HI> nor did they spare to do so, even in the presence of King <HI>Philip</HI> himself, who would therefore often say, <HI>That the</HI> Portuguez <HI>Clergy had made the sharp∣est War with him;</HI> Father <HI>Lewes Alvarez</HI> a Jesuit, preach∣ing one day before the <HI>Spanish</HI> Vice-Roy took his
<PB N="206" REF="106"/>
Text, <HI>Surge, &amp; attolle Grabatum tuum &amp; ambula, Take up thy Bed and walk;</HI> and turning himself to the Vice-Roy, <HI>Sir,</HI> said he, the meaning of this is, <HI>Arise, take up your pack, and be gone home;</HI> But above all, the discontents might be observed in the Noblemens Chappels, espe∣cially in the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI>'s, where they were used to sing the <HI>Lamentations</HI> of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> applying all the scorn and reproach of the <HI>Israelites</HI> to themselves, as <HI>Aquam nostram pecunia bibimus, We have drunken our water for money,</HI> &amp;c. because of the Excise laid upon Wine and other necessaries by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> And that other, <HI>Servi Dominati,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Servants have ruled over us,</HI> &amp;c. And, <HI>The Crown is fallen from our Heads;</HI> Most commonly ending with this Prayer and Invocation, <HI>Recordare Domine,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Remember O Lord what is come upon us, consider and behold our Reproach, Our Inheritance is turned to Strangers, and our Houses to Aliens,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Yet did King <HI>Philip</HI> bear all these Affronts with an incomparable Patience, dissembling with an Admira∣ble Prudence his Passion (if he had any) for these discontents; for he knew the only way to win this Nation to an Obedience and Compliance, must be mildness at first, whatever he intended to practice afterward, and that he had by his exact keeping his Word and Oath, won much upon this People appears, in that during his whole Reign, and that of his Suc∣cessor King <HI>Philip</HI> the third, who followed his Fa∣thers Footsteps, though not with that Craft and Dis∣simulation, they made no Attempts, nor were incli∣nable to revolt, only some small bustles with <HI>Antonio the Bastard</HI> aforementioned, and one or two Counter∣feit <HI>Sebastians,</HI> not worth mentioning, for they, as was said, keeping their words in most things, (though they infringed some of their Priviledges) had almost brought the People to a willing Slavery; But King <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth committing the whole charge of the Government to his Favourite Count <HI>Olivarez,</HI> who though without doubt an able Statesman, yet would seem to have a way in Policy by himself, which no
<PB N="207" REF="106"/>
body else could understand the reasons of, and there∣by lost this whole Kingdom and all its Territories; For such were the new rigorous ways which he used in the Government of <HI>Catalonia</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> both Peo∣ple very tender of their Priviledges, the least breach of which, should have been seconded by a potent Force to have suppressed them, in case they should attempt an Insurrection; When instead of having such Power in readiness, the <HI>Catalonians</HI> had rather opportunity given them to Rebel, and spurs to pro∣voke them thereto; For some Souldiers being scat∣teringly quartered among them, but too few to curb them, they looked upon that as a greater Intrench∣ment upon their Liberties than any before, and a de∣sign utterly to inslave them; wherefore converting their Patience into Fury, they took Arms, Massacred the Souldiers, slew their Vice-Roy, and put them∣selves under the <HI>French</HI> Protection.</P>
<P>This Revolt of the <HI>Catalonians</HI> was a President to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who had extreamly suffered under the breach of their Priviledges, for contrary to the second Article sworn to by King <HI>Philip</HI> the second, <HI>That the Vice-Roy or Governour should be either Son, Brother, Ʋn∣cle or Nephew to the King of</HI> Spain; The Infanta <HI>Mar∣garita di Mantoua</HI> who had no relation at all to the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> was made Governess, which they might and perhaps would have born, had they not been incensed by a more feeling injury in 1636, when a Tax of the fifth part of their Estates was imposed upon all the Subjects of that Kingdom, an intolerable Greivance, and thought so insufferable by the Sou∣thern Parts of the Nation, that they rose in Arms to oppose it, and had set the whole Kingdom in a Flame if it had not been quenched by the timely care and Industry of the Governess. Yet this small stir gave an <HI>Item</HI> to the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> of the readiness of the People to Revolt, which made <HI>Olivarez</HI> endeavour by all ways to cut off the means of their being able to do it; and that was to allure thence <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bra∣ganza,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="107"/>
whom the <HI>Portuguess</HI> looked upon as the Per∣son who of <HI>Right</HI> ought to be their King, and the on∣ly Native of the Kingdom that might restore again the Line of <HI>Alphonso;</HI> Besides he was a Prince who for Power, Riches, and Number of Tenants, not on∣ly exceeded all the Nobles in <HI>Portugal,</HI> but even of <HI>Spain</HI> it self; And indeed the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> was one of the most Glorious Subjects in <HI>Europe,</HI> being allied to most Kings in <HI>Christendome,</HI> which made the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> though they were Competitors for the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Treat this Family with more Hon∣our than any other of his Grandees, receiving them with almost as much respect as if they were Soveraign Princes, which appeared in King <HI>Philip</HI> 2. who most of all desired to abase this Family, yet always when the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> came to visit him, he would meet him in the middle of the Room, and not per∣mitting him to kiss his hand, seat him with himself under the Canopy of Estate.</P>
<P>To draw the Duke therefore out of <HI>Portugal, Oli∣varez</HI> first politickly offered him the Government of <HI>Millain,</HI> a place of great Trust and Honour; but he modestly refused it, as not in a Condition at that present to undertake so great a Command, and indeed expressing an unwillingness to go out of the Kingdom, which made the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Count more willing to draw him from thence, and to this end it was discoursed; <HI>That the King himself was resolved to go in Person to reduce the revolted</HI> Catalonians, <HI>and that there∣fore all the Nobility should be in readiness in four months time to attend His Majesty in that Expedition;</HI> But the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> being suspicious of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> because he knew himself suspected by them, and likely so to be, whilst the <HI>Portuguess</HI> so much affected him, to as∣sure himself of the ones love, and if possible to pre∣vent the others suspition, retires himself to his Coun∣trey House at <HI>Villa Viciosa,</HI> and there follows his sports of Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not at all regarding matters of State, withal sending an Excuse to Count <HI>Olivarez, That his
<PB N="209" REF="107"/>
Affairs were at present in so low and mean a Condition, that he could not appear to attend His Majesty in that Pomp and Splendour which became a Person of his Quality, and that therefore he should do His Majesty more service in staying at home when the other Nobles were abroad, than he could pos∣sibly do by attending him;</HI> This Plot thus failing, made the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> more suspicious of the Duke than ever before; Count <HI>Olivarez</HI> therefore resolves to employ his utmost Art of Dissimulation to intrap him, and that by such means as in reason might make the Duke Ambitious of the Throne; though it appeared <HI>Olivarez</HI> trusted the Duke, only because the Duke should trust him.</P>
<P>In answer to the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI>'s Letter of Ex∣cuse, The Count assures him, <HI>That His Majesty was very well satisfied with the reasons of his not attending him to</HI> Catalonia, <HI>being very sensible of his good inclinations to his service That for his own part he was very sorry his Affairs were in such a low Condition, and could not but commiserate his Interest as his own; That His Majesty to let him know how great confidence he reposed in his Fidelity, had appointed him General of the Militia of the Kingdom, and had for his present supply sent him Threescore Thousand Crowns, leaving it to his Choice to reside in what place near</HI> Lisbon <HI>he pleased.</HI> This strange Confidence reposed in the Duke by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> much amazed the greatest Politicians, who thought it reasonable that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> should have permitted the Duke still to have kept retired in the Countrey, rather than to have given him such a Com∣mand, and called him to <HI>Lisbon</HI> into the continual view of the People, who looking on him as the Heir of that House, which had been ever represented to have the only Right to the Crown, might easily be in∣flamed with a desire to have a King of their own; And these things the Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <HI>Mantoua</HI> was very sen∣sible of, and therefore continually solicited the King to know his Reason, or to desire him to remove those apparent opportunities which he had given the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> to effect a Revolt; But she not only re∣ceived
<PB N="210" REF="108"/>
intricate and doubtful answers from the King and <HI>Olivarez;</HI> but had likewise the former Actions seconded with one, which made her think the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had a mind to toss the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal</HI> into Duke <HI>Braganza</HI>'s hands whether he would or no; For on a sudden without any notice given her, all the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison in St. <HI>Johns</HI> Castle which com∣manded the City of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and indeed upon the strength of which the whole safety and security of the Kingdom depended, were suddenly drawn forth and the Castle left to the disposal of the Duke.</P>
<P>But this was the last Act of Count <HI>Olivarez</HI> confi∣dence in the Duke, for by trusting him so much, he now thought that he could not on the contrary but re∣pose confidence in him, and therefore next Summer in 1640. he again by Letters sollicites him to leave <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> and come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> assuring him, <HI>That his Ca∣tholick Majesty gave him many thanks, and greatly ap∣plauded his Loyalty in the exercise of the Office of General, and was very sensible of the good effects which his Authori∣ty had wrought on the</HI> Portugals; <HI>He next represented to him, the present declining condition of the</HI> Spanish <HI>Monar∣chy, not only by reason of the disorders in</HI> Flanders <HI>and</HI> Italy, <HI>and the preparations of the</HI> Turks, <HI>but more especi∣ally, because their most Potent Enemies the</HI> French, <HI>were now in Assistance of the revolted</HI> Catalonians <HI>entred</HI> Spain; <HI>That it highly concerned His Catholick Majesty to drive them out of his Territories, which could not be done with∣out a very powerful Force. That he being one of the Prime Grandees of the Kingdom, might by his presence in the head of a good number of his Tenants, encourage others to a suit∣able Assistance; That to this purpose His Catholick Majesty expected him every moment, having designed for him great Honours, Priviledges and Dignities suitable to his merit.</HI> But as cunning an Angler as <HI>Olivarez</HI> was, yet he fail∣ed of his Mark, this bait would not hook in the Fish; For though the Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> was accounted no great Polititian, yet his own safety taught him to know, that all these great Offices, and fair Promises, were
<PB N="211" REF="108"/>
but guilded allurements to draw him to his destructi∣on; Having therefore supplyed the King with a con∣siderable number of his Tenants and Friends, he found excuses for his own not going in Person; And to prevent all suspition, he retired again to his Coun∣try-house; Thus these 2 great Personages endeavour∣ed by Craft and Dissimulation to supplant each other; only one strove the others destruction, the other only studied his own safety and preservation.</P>
<P>During all these passages, the Vice-Queen <HI>Margari∣ta</HI> was very Vigilant in her Government, and foresee∣ing in reason what might be the issue of those pro∣ceedings, writ very importunately to the King, assu∣ring him, that if it were not suddenly prevented, the Kingdom would be infallibly lost; To which she re∣cieved no answer, only <HI>Olivarez</HI> slighting her Judg∣ment as fitter to govern a private House than a King∣dom, sent her word, <HI>That if her capacity would not reach to the height and drift of those mysteries of State, yet that her wisdom would keep her from discovering them;</HI> But without doubt <HI>Olivarez</HI> was inwardly perplexed, to see all his Plots thus fail, and foul means he durst not openly attempt, such was both the Dukes Power, and the great Love the people bore him, he therefore at last had recourse to treachery, and gives secret or∣der to Don <HI>Lopez de Ossis,</HI> and Don <HI>Ant. Oquendo,</HI> that when they had relieved <HI>Flanders</HI> with Men and Money, they should with their whole Fleet put into <HI>Portugal,</HI> and that as soon as the Duke should accord∣ing to the duty of his new Place and Office come aboard, they should immediately set sail, and bring him away to <HI>Cales;</HI> But this Plot was by a strange Divine Providence prevented, for that Fleet was to∣tally ruined by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in 1639.</P>
<P>And now was the time come, wherein according to St. <HI>Bernards</HI> Prophesie, the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal</HI> was to be released from the Tyranny of Strangers, and restored again to the Government of a Native
<PB N="212" REF="109"/>
King, to which all things seemed so well to concur, that it cannot be imagined to have less than a Divine hand in it; for though all Plots failing against the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being fearful of somewhat, drew as many <HI>Portugal</HI> Souldiers out of the Kingdom, as conveniently they could, thinking to lessen the ill humours which began now to appear, yet thereby they did but the more inflame those dis∣contents, which were taken at <HI>Vasconsello's</HI> managing all Affairs of State; For though <HI>Margarita of Man∣toua</HI> was a Princess of great Judgment and Know∣ledge in State Affairs, yet she was too much over-ru∣led by <HI>Vasconsellos</HI>'s Secretary of State, whose Govern∣ment was insufferable to the <HI>Portuguez,</HI> who hated as much his obscure birth, as his evil customs, being a man Composed of Pride, Cruelty and Covetousness, knowing no moderation but in excesses; Small faults were by him made Capital Crimes, using all severity to those whom he did but suspect to be dissatisfied with his Government, and exercising with all rigour the <HI>Spanish</HI> Inquisition, punished not only the actions, but the very thoughts of men; The infringing the greatest priviledges of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Nation seeming to him but a Trifle; which continued oppressions, in the end so exasperated the whole people, that in∣couraged by the knowledge of their own strength, by the many distractions of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation, by the late example of the <HI>Catalonians,</HI> and stirred up by the absolute ruin which they saw hung over their heads, there being six Thousand <HI>Portugals</HI> listed eve∣ry year, and forced to serve the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in his For∣reign Wars; From all these considerations, they re∣solved to loose the yoak from off their Necks, and to disclaim all obedience to him, by the Election of a King of their own. Some thought that this conspi∣racy was of at least 10 years standing, and agreed to by most of the Grandees of <HI>Portugal</HI> but it being a State Mystery, is hard to be decided, I will therefore recount only what was publickly acted</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="109"/>Upon Saturday <HI>Feb.</HI> 1. 1640. (and Saturdays have been often observed to be favourable to the <HI>Portuguess</HI> Nation) all the Nobility of that Kingdom, led on by the Marquesses of <HI>Ferriera,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Vi∣mioso</HI> took Arms, and assisted with a great multitude of the Inhabitants of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and some <HI>Portuguez</HI> Souldiers, came to the Castle, scituate in the midst of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> which was the Residence of the Vice-Queen, and serves both for a Palace and a Castle, to which place all the Magistrates for Governing the Kingdom were Assembled; The Guards were 2 Com∣panies of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and 2 of <HI>High Dutch,</HI> who being either gained before by secret Intelligence, or affright∣ed with the great numbers of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> or else from a desire of Novelty, or perhaps unwilling to make resistance against those to whom most of them were joyned by Friendship or Marriage, but however they forsook their Guard without the least opposition, and gave them free admittance into the Castle; At this time <HI>Vasconsellos</HI> was in the Chambers of his Office, upon some reasons he had to suspect an Insurrection, because of the discontents of the People; and was at that instant writing into <HI>Spain</HI> of the Alienation of the minds of the <HI>Portuguez</HI> Nobility from the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Government, and earnestly pressing that some ri∣gorous resolution might be taken to prevent it; which Letters being afterward seized, did sufficiently de∣monstrate his ill will to the <HI>Portuguez</HI> Nation; whilst he was thus busied, the confused noise of the Soul∣diers pierced his ears, and wondring at the cause there∣of, he came forth accompanied only with one Dutch∣man, and one of the Guard, he would have gone down, but was hindred by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who came running up, crying, <HI>kill the Traytor, kill the enemy of our blood;</HI> Whereupon not knowing where to save him∣self, he fled with those accompanying him into an inner Chamber, and there with his sword in his hand, assisted by those with him, disposed himself to sell his Life at the dearest rate he could; but his valour

stood him in no stead, for those two who endeavour∣ed to defend him, being slain with two Musket-shot; He seeing it in vain to defend himself there longer, leapt desperately out of the Window, rather to seek his death, than out of any hopes to save his life; for no sooner was he down, but numberless swords were imbrued in his blood, the very Women and Chil∣dren running to tear in pieces his dead Body, with the same alacrity and chearfulness that he used to tor∣ment them when alive.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Marquess of <HI>Ferriera</HI> was gone to secure the Vice-Queen, whom having committed to the Guard of 200 Musquetiers, he calls a Councel, and in a short discourse, sets forth the miseries the Kingdom had endured, whilst subject to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Government, who sought nothing but their utter de∣struction, then reminding them of the valour and merits of their Nation, he exhorts them to conde∣scend to the Election of a new King, nominating to them the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> as the most worthy of the Crown, not so much for his Power, Riches, or the greatness of his House, as because the Kingdom was his undoubted Right, he being the only person left of that Line, which <HI>for so many years had glorious∣ly governed</HI> Portugal; A long discourse was superflu∣ous to those who were before perswaded; A publick shout interrupted the Marquesses Speech, all of them crying with a loud voice; <HI>That they would have</HI> John <HI>Duke of</HI> Braganza <HI>for their King;</HI> In the whole multi∣tude there was not a face, much less a voice, that did gainsay this general Vote, either because they did all really rejoyce, that they should again have a King of their own Nation, or that none could without danger oppose themselves against the Torrent of so publick a will.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Braganza</HI> was at this time at his Coun∣trey House at <HI>Villa Viciosa,</HI> either by Accident or be∣cause he would always have had occasion to excuse himself, if the business had not succeeded; but by

reason of his absence, they thought fit to make choice of two Governors, whom to avoid the pretences of others, they nominated to be the Archbishops of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and <HI>Braganza;</HI> These began immediately to Exercise their Command, and were obeyed with so much quietness, that in all that great and Populous City of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> there was none slain, but only those aforementioned. The Prisons were opened, neither did any suffer wrong in their Goods or Life; All the Shops were opened as if there had not happened any change of Government; Only the House of <HI>Vasconsel∣los</HI> was plundred with so much Anger and Rage, that they did not Pardon the very Doors and Win∣dows; nay such was the fury of the People, that had they not been hindred by the Souldiers of the Guard they had levelled it with the Ground; As for his Carcase, it suffered all those Indignities which a Peo∣ple wronged both in their Liberties and Estates could inflict; They ran like Madmen to express Living Sentiments of Revenge upon his dead and senseless Corps, vaunting who could invent the newest wayes of disgrace and scorn, till at length almost wearied with their inhumane sport, they left it in the Street so mangled, that it did not seem to have the least resemblance of a Man, from whence it was the next day carried by the Fraternity <HI>Della Misericordia, Of Mercy,</HI> and thrown into the burying-place of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and Infidels; The Marquess of <HI>Alemqua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> after he had by Command from the Governors assured the strongest places in the City, sent several Souldiers into the Streets crying, <HI>Long live King</HI> John <HI>the Fourth;</HI> Which the People hearing, being distracted as it were with very Joy, leaving their Trades they ran up and down, proclaiming him with Voices of <HI>Jubilee,</HI> the greatest part through excess of passion not being able to refrain from Tears.</P>

<P>Yet others affirm, that he was not only acquainted with the Design of the Revolt, but of Council about it; And that some time before, the Nobility having had a private Meeting at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> it was at first pro∣pounded, <HI>That they should reduce the Kingdom into the Form of a Common-wealth;</HI> But that not being approved of by the Major part, the Arch-bishop of <HI>Lisbon</HI> stood up, and in an eloquent Speech having laid before them the Miseries they had endured under the <HI>Spanish</HI> Yoke, recommended to them <HI>John</HI> D. of <HI>Braganza</HI> as the undoubted Heir of the Crown, and their Lawful Soveraign; This Motion they all most willingly assent∣ed to, and concluded to send <HI>Gaston Cotigno</HI> a man of a fluent Tongue to acquaint the D. with their Intentions, and to perswade him to accept the Crown and deliver his Countrey; <HI>Gaston</HI> being arrived, with many well couched words acquaints him, <HI>That there was now a pregnant opportunity offered, to recover the indubitable Right of his Ancestors to the Crown of</HI> Portugal, <HI>That the Nobi∣lity and Clergy were wholy inclined to redeem themselves from the Tyranny of the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>by securing the Crown upon his head; That the Ʋniversal</HI> Odium, <HI>and hatred of the whole People to the</HI> Spanish <HI>Government, the present low Condition of the House of</HI> Austria, <HI>distracted on every side with War, The assured Assistance that</HI> France <HI>and other
<PB N="217" REF="111"/>
Nations, emulating the greatness of</HI> Spain, <HI>would lend, were as so many motives to perswade them, not to let slip so fair an opportunity to regain their Liberty. That if he by refusal should be the sole Enemy to his Countreys Freedom, they would effect it themselves and reduce it to a Commonwealth;</HI> These and many other Arguments he used, which his Love to the House of <HI>Braganza,</HI> his hatred to the <HI>Castilians,</HI> or his own ingenuity prompted him to.</P>
<P>The Dukes amazement permitted him not to re∣turn a sudden answer, but after a little Pause he re∣plied; <HI>That he was highly obliged both to him, and all the Nobility for their Affections to him, but that this was a bu∣siness required great deliberation; that there was no</HI> Medi∣um <HI>between a Throne, and a Chair of Execution; That therefore he should first advise with himself, and not rashly at∣tempt so hazardous a business;</HI> He therefore communi∣cates the whole Affair to his Dutchess <HI>Donna Lucia</HI> Sister to the D. of <HI>Medina Sidonia,</HI> a Woman of a Noble, He∣roick, and Masculine Spirit; with her he consults, whether he were best accept of the Propositions of the Nobility, or to prevent all hazards, go to <HI>Madrid;</HI> and being anxious what course to take, his Wife ge∣nerously told him, <HI>My Friend,</HI> said she, <HI>if thou goest to</HI> Madrid <HI>thou dost incur the danger of losing thy life, and if thou acceptest the Crown thou dost no more, consider then whe∣ther it be not better to dye nobly at home than basely abroad;</HI> These words of his Lady, say some, animated him with a Resolution to accept the Crown; so he returned <HI>Gaston</HI> an answer; <HI>That he would conform himself to the Counsels of the Nobility, resolving to live and run all hazards whatever with them for the regaining his Countreys Liberty.</HI> In the mean time the Marquess of <HI>Ferreira</HI> reduced all those Castles which held out for the K. of <HI>Spain,</HI> and then in the name of the K. of <HI>Portugal</HI> gave the Sacra∣ment of Fidelity, or an Oath of Allegiance to all the Orders, that is to the Clergy, Nobility, and Com∣mons, which was received with so much readiness, that had not the Marquess seen the necessary Orders observed, the People had run into certain inconveni∣encies,
<PB N="218" REF="112"/>
so much they strived to prevent each other in willingness to perform this duty.</P>
<P>Upon Thursday <HI>Feb.</HI> 6, His Majesty made his en∣trance into <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with all those Applauses that a Beloved King can expect from his most Loving Sub∣jects, the Rich Liveries given by the Nobles, the Tri∣umphal Arches, the Streets hung with Tapestry, the multitudes of People flocking to see him, and the Excellent Fire-works, which were so many, that a <HI>Spa∣niard</HI> cried out, <HI>Es possible qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> &amp;c. <HI>Is it possible that K.</HI> Philip <HI>should be deprived of a Kingdom only with Lights and Fireworks without a powerful Army! Certainly this is an evident Token that 'tis the Almighty hand of God;</HI> Yet these I say, were but the least demonstrations of that Cities Love and Joy; For so great was the Concourse of those that crouded to see their New King, that though His Majesty entred into <HI>Lisbon</HI> by noon, he could not through the throng arrive at his Palace till two hours after Sun-set; Curiosity and Love, which usually have the Force to stir up all Affections, made this People Flock so fast to the sight of their Prince, and even those who hated the House of <HI>Bra∣ganza,</HI> did accommodate themselves to the General Joy; His Majesty being arrived at the Pallace, in stead of reposing himself, fell presently to consultation for preserving the Kingdom he had thus suddenly gotten, and the several Governours were commanded to their Countreys to Levy Forces, who listed the Inhabitants from the Age of eighteen to sixty, in whom they found such a ready willingness, that many offered their E∣states and their Lives, and would follow the Colours, though they had Liberty to depart; On the 25 of the same Month, followed the Coronation of His Majesty, which was accompanied with all those Applauses and Demonstrations of Joy, that could proceed from a People of infinite Riches, who weary of the Command of Strangers were consequently ambitious of a King of their own Nation; It was performed with all manner of Grandeur and Magnificence, the following Oath
<PB N="219" REF="112"/>
being administred to the King by the Archbishops of <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>Braga; We swear and promise by the Grace of God, to Rule and Govern you well and justly, and to ad∣minister Justice as far as humane frailty will permit, to maintain unto you your Customs, Priviledges, and Liber∣ties granted unto you by the King's own Predecessors; So help us God, and this his Holy Gospel.</HI> This Oath being administred, the 3 Estates of the Clergy, Nobility and Commons took the following Oath of Allegiance to His Majesty, one for every one of the Estates, pro∣nouncing these words: <HI>I swear by this Holy Gospel of God, touching corporally with my hand, That I recieve for our King and Lawful Soveraign, the High and Mighty King</HI> Don John <HI>the Fourth our Soveraign, and do homage to him according to the use and customs of his Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P>These, and the other Ceremonies being ended, the King accompanied with all his Nobles, returned from the Theatre, where the Coronation was per∣formed, to the Pallace, where notwithstanding it was a very great rain, all the Grandees went bareheaded; There was a sumptuous banquet prepared, but his Ma∣jesty gave himself wholly to consult of preparations for the War, and to shew the magnanimity of his mind, he only displaced two Officers; That of the <HI>Proveditore</HI> of the <HI>Custom-House,</HI> because he was Bro∣ther in Law to the Secretary <HI>Vasconsellos</HI> lately deser∣vedly slain, and that of the Count of <HI>Castanlie,</HI> who was President of the <HI>Tribunal</HI> or <HI>Court of Conscience,</HI> because he was too much interested with the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> As for the <HI>Infanta Margarita</HI> late Vice-Queen, and the Marquess <HI>Della Puella,</HI> Kinsman to <HI>Olivarez,</HI> the Castle called <HI>Pasos de Angiobregas</HI> was assigned them, with Fourteen Thousand Crowns a year for maintenance in that honourable Prison. Shortly af∣ter <HI>Lucia</HI> now Queen of <HI>Portugal,</HI> with her Son Prince <HI>Theodosio</HI> arrived at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> who were recieved with all imaginable expressions of Joy, the Q. being soon after solemnly Crowned, and the Prince installed.</P>

<P><HI>But let us a little recollect, how these Actions were resented in the</HI> Spanish <HI>Court! Most mens minds there, were struck with Consternation, but Count</HI> Olivarez <HI>came smiling to the King, saving,</HI> Sir, I pray give me, <HI>las Albricias, (or a Reward)</HI> to handsel the good News, for now you are more absolute King of <HI>Portugal</HI> than ever, for the people have forfeited all their priviledges by this Re∣bellion, besides the Estate of the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> with all his Complices, are yours by right of Confiscation, so that you have enough to distribute among your Loyal Subjects, by way of reward; <HI>But however</HI> Olivarez <HI>seemed to dis∣semble his Passion, it was believed than this News struck deeper into him than any. The King of</HI> Spain <HI>upon the first News of the Proclamation of K.</HI> John, <HI>sent a Letter to him to this purpose;</HI> Cozen and Duke, Some odd News are brought me lately, which I esteem but folly, considering the proof I have had of the fidelity of your House, give me Advertisement accordingly, because I ought to expect it from you, and hazard not the esteem I make of your self, to the fury of a mutinous rabble, but let your wisdom comport you so, that your Person may escape the dan∣ger; My Council will advise you further; So God guard you,</P>

<P>And now King <HI>John</HI> to shew that the good of his Subjects was his only care, called an <HI>Assembly of the</HI> 3 <HI>Estates</HI> of the Kingdom, who being convened, and the King seated in his Royal Throne, the Bishop of <HI>Elvas</HI> made a Speech to them to the following pur∣pose. <HI>That one of the first Laws of Nature was the uni∣ting
<PB N="221" REF="113"/>
men together, from whence Cities and Kingdoms had their Original, and by which they after defended themselves in War, and maintained themselves in Peace; That for this cause His Majesty had called this Assembly, to consult for the better service of God, defence in War, and Government in Peace; That there could be no service of God without Ʋnion in Religion, no defence without Ʋnion amongst men, no regular Government without Ʋnion of Councils; That His Majesty did expect to be informed by his Loyal Sub∣jects what was for the good of the State; That they were to render thanks to the Almighty, who had given them a King that would govern them by known Laws; That His Majesty did not esteem those Tributes lawful which were paid with Tears; and therefore did from that present take off from his Subjects all Taxes that had been imposed by the Kings of</HI> Spain, <HI>because His Majesty was not willing to Reign over their goods, nor over their heads, nor over their Priviledges, but over their hearts, hoping that they would find out a sweet expedient to defend their Country against their Potent Enemy, who threatned to make them all slaves, and to destroy, and annihilate their Nation; That they would therefore considering his Majesties goodness, and their own Honour, manifest at once to the world, that as never Subjects had such a gracious King, so never King had such Loyal Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>The Bishop having ended his Speech, the most an∣cient Officer of the Chamber of <HI>Lisbon</HI> stood up, and in the name of all the 3 Estates, who stood up like∣wise, returned humble thanks to His Majesty for this gracious bounty, heartily professing, <HI>That they did not only offer up their Goods, but their Lives to His Majesties service, earnestly intreating him to dispose of both as he plea∣sed; And to manifest that their Hearts and Mouths agreed in this free offer of themselves to His Majesty, they present∣ly voted, that two Millions should be immediately raised by this Kingdom;</HI> But the King wisely and politickly de∣clined the imposing a Tax on his Subjects, choosing rather to accept of their <HI>Benevolence;</HI> which made every one strive who should offer most, so that instead
<PB N="222" REF="114"/>
of the Two Millions, there was in short time brought into the Treasury Four Millions of Gold; Nor was this Money intended by them, nor imployed to any other use, then to maintain the <HI>Grandeza,</HI> and Splen∣dor of the K. and Kingdom, there being no need of Money for the payment of Souldiers, every one of∣fering to serve freely, and at their own charge, against their vowed enemies the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was this Kingdom utterly lost to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; King <HI>Alphonso</HI> the 6th. (lately removed from the Government) and his Brother <HI>Don Pedro</HI> now Reigning, and likewise Her Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> Q. <HI>Katherine,</HI> being the Sons and Daughter of this K. <HI>John,</HI> in which Family the Government is like still to continue, and never to revert back to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who lost at this time not only <HI>Portugal,</HI> but with it all they enjoyed by that Kingdom in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> the <HI>Terce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> Islands, and other Islands in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Sea, the Kingdom of <HI>Algarve Brazile,</HI> with all they had in <HI>Africa,</HI> except the Town of <HI>Ceuta</HI> which was the whole that remained to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation of all those great Dominions. <HI>Hist.

<P N="104">104. The remarkable revolutions in the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and the entire Conquest thereof by the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> happened in the same year 1640; As if some fa∣tal influence had inclined most Nations to changes and distractions at that time. It cannot therefore be unpleasant to give a brief account thereof; The In∣habitants of <HI>China</HI> enjoyed all the pleasures of peace under the Government of their last Emperour, who was the most absolute Monarch that ever ruled those vast Territories; when in the year 1640, a year fa∣tal to several States, those Clouds began to gather, which shortly after produced such a storm as ruined the whole Empire; The name of the present Empe∣rour was <HI>Zunchin,</HI> a deceitful, and unfortunate name, for in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language, it signifies <HI>successful</HI> omen, or <HI>Soveraign Dominion,</HI> but how false a prognostick
<PB N="223" REF="114"/>
this was appeared quickly; This Emperor was of a most courteous and good disposition, and certainly his Subjects, who enjoy'd great Plenty, and all the ad∣vantages of Peace, lived truly happy under so Excellent a Prince; But it is not sufficient for a Prince to be Good, and to govern mildly and peaceably, unless he likewise takes care not to have ill Officers, who make use of their Credit under him, to gratifie their Private Passions and to extend their Ambition beyond all Bounds and Limits; yet some Authors have branded him for Covetousness, and that after a great Famine which happened in the Northern Provinces, occasioned by an unheard of number of Locusts, he imposed up∣on his Subjects as high Taxes, as they paid formerly in fruitful flourishing times, the former Money being all mispent, and the Souldiers not paid; Whereupon the number of the Mutineers daily increased, who enriched themselves by Plunder and Rapine. For as <HI>Semedo</HI> in his History of <HI>China</HI> intimates, <HI>Rebellion is the usual Effect of Extortion and Tyranny, especially where the Prince would have more from the People than they are able to give, And therefore</HI> Theopompus (saith he) <HI>King of the</HI> Lacede∣monians, <HI>when his wife told him, that because he had eased the People of many Taxes, he would leave his Son a poorer Kingdom, than he received from his Father; answered, Relinquo sed Diuturnius;</HI> that is, <HI>I shall leave him a more lasting Kingdom,</HI> Happy had it been for <HI>Zunchin</HI> Em∣peror of <HI>China</HI> had he been of <HI>Theopompus</HI> his Mind.</P>
<P>But (saith my Author) though I find him charged with Covetousness, yet I am not very apt to suspect him so guilty of that Vice, as of another usually more fatal to Princes, which is a facile Nature, easie to be wrought upon by others, and too inclinable to favour and indulge themselves, and not willing to undergo the weight of Affairs; From whence it was, that though under the Reign of his Brother <HI>Thienking,</HI> who pre∣ceded him in the Imperial Throne, <HI>Zunchin</HI> so oppos∣ed his Darling Favourite the Eunuch <HI>Guei,</HI> and all the Eunuchs his Partisans, that at last he prevailed
<PB N="224" REF="115"/>
with his brother to banish them all his Court, to the great Satisfaction of the whole Empire, and when his Brother dying without Issue the Imperial Crown fell to him, at his first taking possession thereof, he so per∣secuted the Eunuchs who by abuse of their Authority under his Brother had made themselves abhorred by the whole Nation, that <HI>Guei</HI> in despair poysoned him∣self; yet at last this very Emperor suffered himself, by the crafty insinuation of some about him, contra∣ry to his own Judgment, to be prevailed with to recal those insolent Extortioners, and most imprudently made his incensed Enemies, his reconciled Confidents. And intrusts them with the sole Management of all Affairs, who now conceal their Malice against him, but forgot not to Study revenge; and being backed with his Authority, by their Extortion they grind the face of the People, enrich themselves, render their Master odious to his Subjects, endeavour by all Arts to defraud him, keep back his Souldiers pay and Pro∣vision, thereby to occasion Mutinies; hold correspon∣dence with the Rebels, not acquaint him with the dan∣ger that Threatned both him and his Empire, and at last admit the whole Army of the Traytors into the very Walls of the City <HI>Peking,</HI> the sad Consequences whereof we shall find hereafter.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1640 when two Rebels at the same time revolted against their Lawful Soveraign, one of them was called <HI>Ly,</HI> or <HI>Licungz,</HI> the other <HI>Cham</HI> or <HI>Changien,</HI> and though they were but private Subjects of the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> and Persons of no Considera∣tion either by their Quality or Birth, yet they both equally aspired to the Supream Dominion; And hav∣ing drawn to them great numbers of the choicest Soul∣diers in the Empire, they began to make incursions upon the Northern Provinces which border upon <HI>Tar∣tary;</HI> The Emperour in the mean time did not take sufficient care to stifle this Revolt; In all likelyhood the Complaints and Informations of those Command∣ers who guarded the Frontiers never entred the Court
<PB N="225" REF="115"/>
so far as to reach the Emperors Ears; The Ministers of State, and Officers of the Court stopped the Passage, having already sold the Empire and their Master, by abusing his mild Disposition; The saying of <HI>Dioclesi∣an</HI> is but too True, <HI>That though a Prince be Good, Pru∣dent, Observant, Careful, and Vigilant, yet he cannot pre∣vent Treachery, if those who are in imployment under Him, &amp; who ought to serve and advise him Faithfully, do contrari∣wise combine together to surprize him, and make ill use of his Authority; Either the Ability and Fidelity of the Counsellors must strike a Terror into Rebels, or they will soon make them∣selves a Terror both to the Prince, and His Counsellors.</HI> The two Cheifs of this Rebellion took such advantage by this Pernicious Negligence, that those Counsels which if at first executed would with great facility have put an end to these Troubles, became now both unfit, and impossible to be put in Execution; In a short time they gained themselves the Renown of Great and most Va∣liant Commanders, and by this advantage they quick∣ly had Forces enough, not only to defend themselves, but to inlarge their Conquests, their Confederates in∣creasing daily so that by force of Arms they made them∣selves Masters of Five Provinces.</P>
<P>The Rebel <HI>Cham</HI> went to establish himself in that Province which of the five was the most remote from the Emperors Court, and took upon him the Title of King, with full Resolution to extend his Conquests to the Neighbouring Provinces; The other Rebel called <HI>Ly,</HI> having, as it appeared, framed to himself greater designs, approached nearer the Court, and had alrea∣dy in his Imagination conquered the whole Empire; But judging from the advantage he had received from <HI>Cham's</HI> Confederacy with him at the beginning, how great an obstacle so powerful a Competitor might be to him in process of time, he did in all likelihood make him away, either by secret Treachery or open Violence, some Historians affirming he was cut off by a Party sent against him by <HI>Ly,</HI> or <HI>Lincungz,</HI> who having now no Competitor that could aspire to the Soverainty, began
<PB N="226" REF="116"/>
to noise abroad his vast Projects, and settled himself in the Capital City of the Province <HI>Xensi,</HI> called <HI>Sin∣gansuase;</HI> He caused himself to be crowned, and took up∣on him the Title of Emp. of <HI>China,</HI> kept an Imperial Court, and acted like a Soveraign Prince, threatning in a short time to make himself Master of the Emperors Court, and to join <HI>Pequin</HI> which is the Chief, to the five other Provinces; It is not certainly known what was the first rise of these 2 Usurpers, only it is famed that they were both Generals in the Emperour of <HI>China</HI>'s Ar∣mies, who perceiving themselves, nor Souldiers to be neither regarded, nor recompenced for their Services, but to be ill used by the Ministers of State, they re∣volted against their King, and conspired together to be their own Pay-masters; resolving to make the Gran∣dees of the Court understand, <HI>That those who serve their Prince in his Armies are without Comparison better capacita∣ted to serve or disserve the State, than those whose sole Imploy∣ment it is by their Court Artifices to ingratiate themselves with their Prince:</HI> They began at first with Complaints, and from Complaints they came to Arms, and having once began the Trechery, they thought themselves engaged most vigorously to prosecute it.</P>
<P>Whilst the Flame of Rebellion, and Civil War, which every day increased, threatned the whole Empire of <HI>China</HI> with a General Ruin and Revolution the <HI>Tartar</HI> did most attentively and vigilantly watch for some pre∣text to enter into some or all the Provinces, yet he would imbrace none but what was honourable, having solemnly sworn Peace with the Royal Family of <HI>China;</HI> and therefore he could not resolve with himself, as great an Idolater as he was, to violate that Oath which he had taken in the presence of his Idols; A great Ex∣ample to those, who boast of the True Religion, and yet swear and promise without regarding the perform∣ance either of their Oaths or Promises; Finally the <HI>Tartar</HI> judged very truly, that if he joined his Forces with any one of the 2 Parties, he should in a short time make himself Umpire and Master of one or both; he
<PB N="227" REF="116"/>
therefore joined with neither, but kept an Army under strict discipline on the Frontiers, hoping for some favou∣rable Opportunity of passing into <HI>China</HI> without falsifying his Faith, which he desired to keep inviolable; <HI>Ly</HI> in the mean time resolved to secure the whole Empire to himself, though it could not be done without difficulty since the <HI>Chineses</HI> have such a tender and passionate Love to their Soveraigns, that they seem rather to I∣dolize than love them, and the present Prince was no less Beloved than any of his Ancestors, which the Ty∣rant being sensible of, for his own security took care to pay his Souldiers, and resolved with all possible speed to compleat the entire Invasion of the whole Empire; But first he thought fit to acquaint his most resolute Commanders and his greatest Confidents, with his Resolutions, which he did in these Terms;</P>
<P><HI>My Friends,</HI> said he, <HI>the Lot is cast, we must now either gain all or lose all, we cannot hereafter be greater Rebels than we are already, therefore let us dispatch with all expe∣dition the Conquest of the other Ten Provinces of</HI> China, <HI>now that we have made</HI> 5 <HI>Provinces feel the power of our Swords. But most assuredly when we shall have subdued the rest, none will be so audacious and rash to call us Rebels and Ʋsurpers; Rebels if Victorious cease to be Rebels, and become the Right and Lawful Lords and Masters; What therefore now re∣mains, but that I either make my self the Soveraign Monarch of</HI> China, <HI>or lose my Life in these Feilds, and there become a Prey to Birds of the Air, and Beasts of the Feild; there is nothing in all this spacious Empire can gratifie me, but either a Throne or a Grave, and I will advance my self to such a pitch of Grandeur, that if I fall, it shall be with such a Crack as shall shiver the whole frame of Government, and bury the whole Empire under my Ruins.</HI> Thus <HI>Ly</HI> spoke to his Followers, that were intirely devoted to him, who find∣ing their Resolution, he speedily entred upon a most bold and hazardous Design, but of high importance for the sudden accomplishing his Pretensions, which was to go directly against the very Person of the Emp. and with all his Forces to assault the Imperial Court, and
<PB N="228" REF="117"/>
Capital City of the Empire, fully determining to strike off the Emperors head, and to place the Crown on his own; By this eminent exploit he knew he should pos∣sess himself of the Kings Treasure, which would highly strengthen his Party, and besides cut off all Power from any of the Royal Family to raise any Forces, or to head any who should yet have any sparks of Loyalty in their Breast. To execute this Grand Attempt, he must make himself Master of the Great City of <HI>Pequin,</HI> where all the Court resided; But he could not hope to do this by open Force, and therefore resolves to do it by Stratagem, and so to surprize the Town, that the Thunderclap should be felt before the noise was heard. By this sudden surprize, he would not leave the Emp. time to prepare either for his defence or flight; Otherwise it would have been very difficult for <HI>Ly</HI> with all his Force he could have raised, to have so suddenly reduced this Great <HI>City;</HI> For beside the vast Extent of <HI>Pequin,</HI> it was very well fortified, and in time of Peace was guarded with 80000 of the Emp. best Souldiers; The Imperial Palace alone is above 2 Miles round, and defended with 2 or 3 Walls, Ditches and Bulwarks, which are all distinct from each other and very strongly guarded. <HI>Ly</HI> foresaw all these dif∣ficulties, and therefore he had already by Presents and fair Promises bribed several of the Grandees of the Court and Council, whereby he found it not difficult to engage them in his Interests. A strange thing, that when there was not one Person of the common people either in City or Court who could be drawn into this Treason, yet several of the Magistrates and Officers of the Court made themselves a detestable Example, by entring into a conspiracy against the State, and the Person of their Prince; The chief of the conspirators were the Eunuchs of the Imperial Palace, who were then very potent, and considerable in the Court, and upon whose Fidelity the Emperor of <HI>China</HI> much presumed, entrusting them with the Guard of his Person and the Government of the State.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="117"/>The Tyrant <HI>Ly</HI> having thus laid his treasonable de∣sign, he sent into the imperial City of <HI>Pequin</HI> several of his Trusty, and most valiant Commanders, dis∣guised like Merchants, with instructions to keep open shop, and to sell several Rich Merchandizes; These counterfeit Merchants were never suspected to be great Commanders, and their Apprentices and Servants choice Souldiers; But it concerned them to mind their Trade, for upon that depended the purchase of the greatest Empire in the world, which was put to sale by those who were most of all obliged to pre∣serve and defend it; When the bargain was thus made and earnest mutually given, those in the City and Court, who kept Intelligence with the Tyrant, failed not upon several pretences to lessen the Guards, and to weaken as much as possible the strength of the place; And on a sudden <HI>Ly</HI> appeared, and found the Gates of the Town open, and his men victorious in the Conquest of this great City; the Inhabitants being so astonished, that before they could resist, they found themselves under the power of their ene∣mies; The Emperor <HI>Zunchin</HI> did not perceive the de∣plorable condition of his State till it was past remedy, for now he knew that the rage of his enemies would not only take from him by violence his Empire and Crown, but his life also; and then too late percieved the design of those ill Counsellors, who advised him not to raise Forces, nor send Money nor Recruits to those Commanders, who guarded the Frontiers; He now poor Prince, saw himself besieged in his own Pallace, and was fully convinced he was betray∣ed, and therefore thought of nothing but to depart out of this life by a death worthy of his Dignity and Courage; His desperate condition made him feeling∣ly reflect, how much in him was to be pityed, the too facile and easie natures and disposition of Prin∣ces, which is usually attended with sad disasters both to themselves, and their States.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Pequin</HI> being of a vast extent, before

the Traytors could by Force enter the Pallace, which was very spacious, some of the most Loyal Officers, and Souldiers made a vigorous resistance, which the Emperour lookt upon as a grateful Testimony of their Allegiance, since thereby he had liberty to choose his own death, which he considered as his last happiness; A frail and cruel satisfaction which the pride of man makes him seek out, to be his own Executioner, that thereby he may dye with the greater renown and pomp. During the time of this resistance, the Em∣perour considered how speedily to dispose both of his Royal Family and Person, which was in the most Tragical manner that ever Histories related; He had but one only Daughter, very young, which till now had been the hope and desire of the Empire, his on∣ly Son dying before this direful disaster; The Em∣perour cut her Throat with his own hands, and at her own supplication, that she might not see her Honour and Illustrious Rank become a shameful Prey to a Tyrant and Traytor, who had nothing great and eminent in him, but his Treason and Rebellion against his Lawful Soveraign; After this horrid Execution, the Emperour with his hands, yet reeking with the blood of his Daughter, went into the Garden of the Pallace, accompanied with his Lawful Spouse, the Empress, for whom he had forsaken six other Wives who had each of them the Title of Queen, 30 others who were the most illusttrious Ladies of the Empire, and 3000 others of lesser Quality; Some of their faithful servants understanding their cruel intentions, filled the Air in proclaiming their griefs, some cry∣ed, <HI>My Lord and my Husband,</HI> others, <HI>My King and my Master,</HI> and some <HI>my Father,</HI> every one accent∣ing their sorrow in a tone suitable to their part in this scene of sorrow.</P>
<P>The heart of this unfortunate Prince was penetra∣ted with so great affliction, that it could admit of no Consolation, and only comforted himself that he should preserve the Honour of his Empress, being al∣together
<PB N="231" REF="118"/>
unconcerned for his other Queens, and nu∣merous Wives; Some few Courtiers, who among so many Traytors remained faithful to him, attended with a doleful silence upon the Emperour and Em∣press, who could neither speak a word, nor shed a tear, sorrow had taken such entire possession of their hearts. <HI>Zunchin</HI> was a young Prince, endowed with all the qualities that might render him amiable to his People; His Royal Spouse the Empress loved him with so tender an affection, that to testifie the since∣rity of her Passion to him, she resolved to dye either with or before him; The Prince being very pensive, and sollicitous how to prevent greater disgraces, went together with those who accompanied him towards a little Grove, at the entrance of which he stopped, and then the Empress guessing at his design, approach∣ed to him, and giving him her last embraces, she part∣ed from that person which was the dearest to her of all things upon Earth, with all the grief and sorrow that Humane Nature is capable of, and then she en∣tred all alone into the Grove, and with a Cord hang∣ed her self upon one of the Trees; A dreadful spec∣tacle which might make even those who were more sensless than the Trees, lament so direful a death of so great an Empress. Presently after, the Emperour went and placed himself near his Wife, whom he saw hanging upon a Tree, having finished her Life by a death as violent as that which he had inflicted upon his Daughter; Then poor Prince he asked a lit∣tle Wine of one of the Lords which attended him, not that he was a lover of Wine, but on the contra∣ry, was the most sober, and moderate in his plea∣sures of all the Princes which ever governed the Em∣pire; And was so chast toward women that he never frequented his <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which made his Subjects call him the <HI>Chast Prince;</HI> It was not therefore for the love of Wine, but a little to revive and refresh his Spirits; And doubtless he had need of great courage to put in Execution what he designed; When the
<PB N="232" REF="119"/>
Wine was presented to him he sipped a little of it, and then biting with violence one of his Fingers, and squeezing out his blood, he writ therewith these following words.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Mandorins <HI>(or Eunuchs) are all Villains; they have perfidiously betrayed their Prince, they all deserve to be hanged, and it will be a laudable Act of Justice, to execute this Sentence upon them; It is fit they should all suffer death, that thereby they might instruct those who succeed them to serve their Prince more Loyally; As for the People they are not Criminal, and deserve not to be punished, and therefore to use them ill, will be injustice; I have lost my Kingdoms which I recieved in inheritance from my Ancestors; In me is finished the Royal Line, which so many Kings my Pro∣genitors continued down to me, with all the Grandeur, and Fame suitable to their Majestick Dignity, I will therefore for ever close my eyes, that I may not see this Empire descen∣ded to me, thus ruined and ruled by a Tyrant; I will go and deprive my self of that Life for which I can never suf∣fer my self to be indebted to the basest and vilest of my Sub∣jects; I have not the confidence to appear before them, who being born Subjects are become my Enemies and Traytors; It is fit the Prince should dye, since his whole State is now expiring; And how can I endure to live, having seen the loss and destruction of that which was dearer to me than Life.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince, after he had thus writ what his just grief dictated to him, he untied his Hair, and co∣vering his face, presently with his own hands he hang∣ed himself upon a Tree, near to that on which the Empress remained strangled; This was the Tragical <HI>Catastrophe</HI> of this unfortunate Monarch. The Empe∣rour of <HI>China</HI> remained thus hanging on a Tree, the Prince who was the Idol of his people, at the very name of whom Millions of men trembled; The So∣veraign of above an 100 Millions of Subjects, the Monarch of a Kingdom as spacious as all <HI>Europe;</HI> He who counted his Souldiers by Millions, and his Taxes and Tributes by hundreds of Millions; Finally, the
<PB N="233" REF="119"/>
Potent Emperour of the great Empire of <HI>China</HI> is hanged upon a tree, and his Royal Consort the Em∣press upon another near him; What a weighty load did the trunks of these trees support? But of what weight had it need be, to make the great men upon earth duly weigh what all their terrible and ambiti∣ous <HI>Grandeur</HI> is, which in so few moments passes from the height of the felicities of this Life to an Abyss of misery; This unhappy Monarch finished his Reign at the Age of 32 years; He dyed very soon, but it was his misfortune he dyed no sooner; For whatever King or Emperour he be who reckons his years which have been exposed to such direful Tragedies, cannot be said to have lived such a number of years, but to have undergone a far greater number of miseries and calamities.</P>
<P>The Report of the Emperours death being soon spread over the City, those Loyal Subjects, who had hitherto resisted, abandoned their resolution; So that <HI>Ly</HI> presently became Master both of the City and Court, taking up his quarters in the Imperial Pallace, where he saw himself possessed of all the prodigious treasures of that vast State, and was soon after Crown∣ed in the Court at <HI>Pequin,</HI> and Proclaimed Soveraign Emperour of <HI>China,</HI> yet he enjoyed his trayterous usurpation a very short time, for the <HI>Tartars</HI> reckon∣ing all Obligations of the former League of peace, made void by the death of <HI>Zunchin,</HI> and all the Roy∣al Family, Soon after invaded the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and made an absolute conquest thereof, forcing the Tyrant <HI>Ly</HI> to fly, and hide himself in the Northern parts of the Kingdom, who has not since been heard of; Neither did the treacherous Eunuchs escape ven∣geance, for they were in a little while most of them destroyed and cut off by the <HI>Tartars.
