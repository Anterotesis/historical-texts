<P>the latter Age. Philosophers, Poets, Historiographers, and learned Diuines, how they haue peregrinated to know the life of States, and the fashions of farre Countries would be an endlesse taske for me to relate. Many (I con∣fesse) long to see the remotest regions of the earth, but dare not vndertake the dangers of sight, the chargeable expences of tributarie iourney, the hard indurance of flint-stones for a soft feather-bed, the extremities of thirst, nor the parching heate of the Sunne, hunger in the belly, nor the moist distilling dew to bee a humide couerlet to their tender skin, with innumerable other insuing miseries. But <HI>Ixion</HI>-like, mistaking <HI>Iuno,</HI> would by a meere imaginati∣on, run out the sleeping course of an endlesse peregrinati∣on. For my part, what I haue reaped, is by a deere-bought knowledge, as it were, a small contentment, in a neuer contenting subiect, a bitter pleasant taste of a sweet-seasoned sowre, and all in all, what I found was more then ordinaray reioycing, in an extraordinary sorrow of delights. The contemplation of this delightfull and pain∣full pilgrimage, did incite my minde to aduenture vpon my meditated attempts; not onely for my owne content∣ment, but also to animate other forward spirits to the like resolute designes. The commodity of which being by mee duly pondered and weighed (as it were) in the ballance of my owne contemplating thoughts, from <HI>Paris, Anno Do∣mini</HI> 1610. I attempted my voyage, bequeathing my pro∣céedings to the protection of God, my body to turmoiling paines, my hands to the <HI>Burdon,</HI> and my féete to the hard bruising way: And as vnwilling to make relation of my passing through <HI>France, Sauoy,</HI> the <HI>Ligurian Alpes,</HI> and al∣most all <HI>Italy,</HI> fith it is manifested vnto many in this Iland both by sight and report, I would shunne, so farre as possi∣ble I can, all prolixitie of knowne, and therefore vnneces∣sary discourse. Upon the 40 day after my departure from <HI>Paris,</HI> I arriued at <HI>Rome,</HI> of which I will memorize some rarest things,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> &amp; so procéed. This Cittie of <HI>Rome,</HI> now ex∣tant, is not that old <HI>Rome</HI> which <HI>Romulus</HI> founded, for

after the Monarchy of the Romanes had attained to the full height, the <HI>Gothes,</HI> a base and vnknowne people, dis∣playing their banner against this glorious and imperiall Citie,, in the end razed, and subuerted thier Palaces, e∣qualizing the Walles with the ground. After the which detriment and ouer-throw (the late subdued <HI>Romanes</HI> re∣couering their ruinous habitation) were inforced to with∣draw the scituation of the Towne a little more downe∣ward, neere the bankes of <HI>Tybris:</HI> And transported the stones of these ransacked buildings, to re-edifie their new dwelling places.</P>
<Q><L>Hic vbi nunc Roma est, olim fuit ardua silua,</L>

<P>Many haue wrote of the singularities of old <HI>Rome,</HI> and I will also receite some decayed Monuments thereof, which I haue séene: The speciall obiect of antiquitie I saw, being neuer a whit decayed to this day, is the <HI>Templum omnium Deorum,</HI> but now, <HI>omnium Sanctorum,</HI> builded in a <HI>rotun∣do,</HI> and open at the toppe, with a large round, like to the queire of the holy graue. A pretty way from this, are the re∣mainants of that ancient Amphitheater beautified with great Columnes, of a wonderfull bignesse and height; the reason why it was deuised, the Ghosts of the slaughtered <HI>Sabines</HI> may testifie. To be briefe, I saw the decaied house of worthy <HI>Cicero,</HI> the high Capitoll, the Palace of cruell <HI>Nero,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monuments of Antiquitie.</HI></NOTE> the Statues of <HI>Marcus Aurelius, Alexander</HI> and his horse <HI>Bucephalus.</HI> The gréene Hill like vnto mount <HI>Ca∣uallo,</HI> that was made of the Pottars shards at one time, which brought the tributary gold to this imperiall seate, the seuen Hilles whereon shee standes, and their seuen Pyramides, the Castle <HI>S. Angello,</HI> which <HI>Adrian</HI> first founded, and their doubtfull transported Reliques from Ierusalem, with many other things I diligently remarked, some whereof were friuolous, some ambi∣guous, and some famous. Besides all these, I sawe one most sight-worthy-spectacle, which was the Li∣brarie of the ancient Romanes, being licentiated to
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
enter with two Gentlemen, sir <HI>William Kerre,</HI> and <HI>Iames Aughtermuty</HI> my Countrey-men; where, when I was come, I beheld a world of old bookes, the first whereof was an infinite number of Gréeke Bibles, subscribed with the hands of these Fathers, who (as they say) translated them out of the Hebrew tongue.</P>
<P>I saw also the Academies of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> wherein he trea∣teth of the Soule, Health, Life, Nature, and Qualities of Men, with the Medicaments of <HI>Galen</HI> for the diseases and infirmities of man: the familiar Epistles of <HI>Cicero,</HI> the <HI>Ae∣neidos</HI> of <HI>Virgill,</HI> the <HI>Saphick</HI> verses of that <HI>Lesbian Sa∣pho,</HI> the workes of <HI>Ouid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Famous Au∣thours.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Plinie, Plutarch, Titus Liuius, Ho∣ratius, Strabo, Plato, Homer, Terentius, Cato, Hippocra∣tes, Iosephus, Pythagoras, Diodorus Siculus, Eusebius,</HI> Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> Saint <HI>Cyprian,</HI> Saint <HI>Gregory,</HI> and likewise the workes of other excellent Phi∣losophers, Diuines, and Poets: all wrot with their owne hands, and sealed with their owne names, and manuall subscriptions. I saw also the forme of the first ancient writing, which was vpon leaues of trées, cakes of lead, with their fingers on ashes, barkes of trees, with strange figures, and vnknowne letters, that was brought from Egypt: for the Egyptians first deuised the vse thereof, and the sight of infinite Obligatorie writings, of Emperours, Kings, and Princes, which I omit to relate, referring the same to be registred by the next beholder.</P>
<P>Bidding adiew to my Company, and this Librarie, I longed to view the gorgeous, Mosaicall worke of Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church: The matter was no sooner conceiued, but I went to y<SUP>e</SUP> doore, yet afraid to enter, because I was not accustomed with the carriage and ceremonies of such a <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum.</HI> But at the last, abandoning all scru∣polositie, I came in boldly, and on my right hand as I en∣tred within the doore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The brasen I∣mage of S.

many crosses his sencelesse body, kisse his feet, and euery one of his seuerall toes: next, they lay their heads vnder the soale of his right foot; and arising, rubbe their Beades on his hard costed belly: thus adoring that breathlesse masse of mettall, more then though it were a liuing crea∣ture. O wonderfull and strange spectacle! that these one∣ly titular Christians, should become worse of knowledge then Ethnicke Pagans, to worship and reuerence the workmanship of mens hands. Woe and shame bee vnto you all blinde hereticall Papists, why should you make to your selues Idols and Images of Iron, Siluer, Gold, Stéele, Brasse, Stone, Earth and Trée; and notwithstan∣ding would excuse the matter with a superstitious reason, aledging, you do it onely in remembrance, where other∣wise it is a damnable signe of wilfull obdurate ignorance. May not the prohibition of the second Commandement of Gods law, confound the error of this idolatry, ingrafted in your hardened hearts.</P>
<P>What vertue can bee in a lumpe of Brasse? or what comfort in the deuices of Handy-craftsmen? Alas, no∣thing but eternall sorrow and condemnation. This was one of the lamentable errours I saw in the <HI>Romane</HI>-Sea, a∣mongst many other thousands. When the foolish <HI>Listranes</HI> or <HI>Licaoneans</HI> would haue sacrificed Buls to the honour of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Superstition of Papists.</HI></NOTE> they rent their clothes, and ran in a∣mong the people, crying, and saying; <HI>O men why doe yee these things? wee are euen men subiect to the like passions that you be:</HI> How is it then, that the Apostles being aliue, would haue no acknowledging by any homage of man; yet when they are dead, the <HI>Romanists</HI> wil worship their coun∣terfeit similitude, in stone, or tree. What vnworthy-fai∣ned traditions, and superstitious Idolatrie? what strange new deuising trickes they vse, to plant idle Monasteriall Loyterers? How many manner of wayes these Belly-minded slaues Epicure-like leade their liues? And what a Sea of abhominable villany they swimme into, practi∣sing euen vnnaturall vices, I meane of their wrongfully

called Religious Bishops, Priests, Friers, Curates, and all the hypocriticall crew, of these peruerse <HI>Iebusites</HI>; no heart can expresse, nor the most eloquent tongue, can suf∣ficiently vnfold. But for feare of excommunication, from that Antichristian Curtezan, I dare not perseuer longer heerein: Although I can, yea, and so truely bewray their all-corrupted estate, that I neede no information of any Romane-Nouice-Traueller. Of whose sight and experi∣ence, would God all the Papists in <HI>Brittaine</HI> had the like eie-witnessing approbation as I haue had, I am certainely perswaded, with teares and sighes, they would heauily be∣mone the terrible fall of that <HI>Babylonian</HI> whoore, which (in a prophane estimation) is their holy mother Church. For I sincerely sweare to thée, O faithfull Christian (as the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> vsually doth in his humours) by the golden-tripled crowne of my ghostly father, <HI>Paulo Papa Quinto,</HI> whatsoe∣uer, sacriledge, incest, or villanie a Papist committeth; let him come heere, and fill the bribing hands of the Simonia∣call Mineons, of the thrice-crowned Priest, (for <HI>Roma non captat ouem sine lana.</HI>) And hee shall haue Indulgen∣ces, Dispensations, adioyned Pennances, or absolued Offences, for hundreds, thousands, lesse or more yeares. The period of Time, after eight and twenty daies abode, wishing my departure, I hardly escaped from the hunting of these bloud-sucking Inquisitors, of whom the most part were mine owne Countrymen: for I may iustly af∣firme it, man hath no worser enemy, then his owne suppo∣sed friend. And the <HI>Italian</HI> saith in his Prouerb: <HI>God keep me from the hurt of my friends, for I know well how to keepe my from mine enemies.</HI> From thence bound East∣ward, I visited <HI>Naples,</HI> the commendation of which, I one∣ly reuolue in this verse;
<Q><L>Inclyta Parthenope gignit Comites{que} Duces{que}</L></Q></P>
<P>Among many other remarkable things, neere to this Citie (as <HI>Lacus Auernus, Sibillaes</HI> Caue, <HI>Purcoli</HI>; the <HI>Sul∣phurean</HI> Mountaine, <HI>Capua</HI> and <HI>Cuma,</HI> where banished <HI>Aeneas</HI> from <HI>Troy,</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> arriued) I saw the Mo∣nument

<P>Before I came neere to <HI>Loretta,</HI> by tenne miles, I ouer∣tooke a Caroch, wherein were two Gentlemen of <HI>Rome,</HI> and their two Concubines; Who, when they espied me, sa∣luted me kindly, enquiring of what Nation I was, whi∣ther I was bound, and what pleasure I had to trauell alone? After I had to these demands giuen satisfaction, they intreated me to come vp in the Caroch, but I thanke∣fully refused, and would not, replying the way was faire, the weather seasonable, and my body vnwearied. At last they perceiuing my absolute refusall, presently dismounted on the ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Foure Roman Pilgrimes.</HI></NOTE> to recreate themselues in my company: and incontinently, the two yong vnmarried Dames, came forth also, and would by no perswasion of me, nor their fa∣miliars, mount againe; Saying, they were all Pilgrimes, and bound to <HI>Loretta</HI> (for deuotions sake) in pilgrimage, and for the penance enioyned to them by their Father Confessour. Truely, so farre as I could iudge, their pen∣nance was small, being carryed with horses, and the appea∣rance of deuotion much lesse: for lodging at <HI>Riginati,</HI> af∣ter supper, each youth led captiue his deerest Darling to an vnsanctified Bed, and left mee to my accustomed re∣pose.</P>
<P>When the morning Star appeared, wee embraced the

Approa∣ching neare the gate of the Uillage, they pulled off their shooes and stockings, walking bare-footed through the stréetes, to this ten thousand times polluted Chappell, mumbling <HI>Pater Nosters,</HI> and <HI>Aue Mariaes</HI> on their beades. When they entred into the Church, wherein the Chappell standeth, I stood at the entry beholding many hundreds of bare-footed blinded bodies, créeping on their knées and hands: Thinking themselues not worthy to go on foote, to this idely supposed <HI>Nazaretane</HI> House, like to this say∣ing;

<P>Unto this falsly patronized Chappell, they offer yearely many rich gifts, amounting to an vnspeakable value, as Chaines, and Rings of Gold and Siluer, Rubies, Dia∣monds, silken Tapestries, and such like. The Iesuiticall and Penitentiall Fathers, receiue all, but who so enioy all, let <HI>Camera reuerenda Romana,</HI> grant certification to this <HI>Lorettan</HI> auariciousnesse, who fill their coffers twice in the yeare therewith. My foure Pilgrimes, hauing per∣formed their ceremoniall customes, came backe laughing, and asked why I did not enter? But I, as vnwilling to shew them any further reason, demanded what the matter was? O (said the <HI>Italians</HI>) <HI>Iurando per il Cielo è Iddio Sa∣cratissimo;</HI> This is the house wherein the Uirgin <HI>Mary</HI> dwelt in <HI>Galilee:</HI> And to the confirmation of these words shewed mee a Booke, out of which I extracted these Anno∣tations.</P>

Wherefore since the scituation thereof, and the de∣corements of their beautifull Palaces, are so well knowne by the better sort, I desist, concluding thus; this incompa∣rable mansion is the onely Paragon of all Cities in the world. In the time of my staying heere, I went forth to <HI>Lumbardy,</HI> and visited the famous Cities of <HI>Padua, Ve∣rona,</HI> and <HI>Ferrara.</HI> The commendation of which is celebra∣ted in these verses:

<HEAD>A Description of the Adriaticall and Ionean Ilands, how they haue beene first named, and now gouerned, of Istria, Dalmatia, Slauonia, Epire, Peloponnesus, and A∣thens, of a Monster borne in Lesina, and what dangers befell him in his voyage to Creta.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter 24 dayes attendance, and expecting for passage, I imbarked in a <HI>Carmoesalo,</HI> being bound to <HI>Zara Noua</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia:</HI> Scarcely had we lost the sight of <HI>Venice,</HI> but wee in∣countred with a deadly storme at <HI>Seroco è Leuante.</HI> The maister had no compasse to direct his course, neither was hee expert in Nauigation; because they vse commonly, either on the South or North sides of the Gulfe, to hoyse vp sailes at night, and against breake of day they haue full sight of land, taking their directions from the topped hilles of the maine continent. The tem∣pest increasing, and the windes contrary, wee were con∣strained to seeke vp for the Port of <HI>Parenzo</HI> in <HI>Istria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Istria</HI> was first called <HI>Giapidia,</HI> according to <HI>Pliny: Cato</HI> affirmeth, that it was <HI>Istria</HI> of one <HI>Isiro;</HI> but by the mo∣derne writers, <HI>l'ultima regione di Italia.</HI> By <HI>Ptolomeus</HI> it is said to be of length 120 miles, and 40 large.</P>
<P>That part which bordereth with the sea, belongeth to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> but the rest within land holdes of the Em∣perour, and the Archduke of <HI>Austria.</HI> The countrey it selfe aboundeth in Cornes, Wines, and all manner of fruits, necessary for humane life. Néere to this hauen wherein we lay, expecting roome windes; I saw the ruines of old
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
<HI>Iustinopoli,</HI> so called of <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour, who buil∣ded it vpon an Iland of a miles length, &amp; three acres broad. And to passe betwixt the Citie and the firme land, there were seuen bridges made. It was anciently strong, but now altogether decayed. The principall Cities in <HI>Istria</HI> at this day, are these, <HI>Parenzo, Humago, Pola, Rouigno.</HI></P>
<P>The winds fauouring vs, we weighed anchors, and sai∣led by the Iles <HI>Brioni,</HI> so much estéemed for the fine stones they produce, called <HI>Istriennes:</HI> which serue to beautifie the Uenetian Palaces. About mid-day I saw <HI>Mount di Cal∣daro,</HI> on the foot of which, the ancient Citie of <HI>Pola</HI> is situ∣ated, hauing a harbour wherein small shippes may lie. True it is, this Port is not much frequented, in respect of a con∣tagious Lake neere to it, which infecteth the aire with a filthy exhalation. I saw hard by this place, the ruines of the Castell <HI>Di Oriando</HI>; the Arke triumphant, and the reliques of a great Amphitheater.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pola.</HI></NOTE> This <HI>Pola</HI> was called by <HI>Pliny, Iulia pietas,</HI> and it standeth on the South-east part of <HI>Istria.</HI> Continuing our course, wee passed the perilous gulfe of <HI>Carnaro,</HI> and sailed close by the Ile <HI>Sangego,</HI> called for∣merly <HI>Illirides:</HI> This Ile is of circuit foure score, and of length thirty miles. Our fresh water waxing scant, and the windes falling out contrary to our expectation, we sought in to <HI>Valdogosta</HI> in the Ile of <HI>Osero,</HI> which is a safe hauen for ships and Gallies. This <HI>Osero</HI> was first named <HI>Asphorus,</HI> and then <HI>Absirtites,</HI> of a captaine <HI>Absertus,</HI> who came from <HI>Colchos,</HI> accompanied with many people, to bring backe <HI>Medeas</HI> to his father <HI>Acetus.</HI> Whose purpose being frustrated, staied still, and inhabited this land, as wit∣nesseth <HI>Apollonius Rhodius.</HI> A fit opportunity obtained, vpon the eight day we arriued in the roade of <HI>Zara</HI> in <HI>Dal∣matia</HI>; for there the <HI>Carmoesalo</HI> stayed, and I was expo∣sed to séeke passage for <HI>Ragusa.</HI></P>
<P>By the way I recall the great kindnesse of that <HI>Dalma∣tian</HI> Master,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The kindnesse of a Dalmatian.</HI></NOTE> for offering my condition, I found him more then courteous, and would haue no more but the halfe of that which was his bargaine at <HI>Venice.</HI> Besides this, hee
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
also entertained mee three dayes, with a most bountifull and kinde acceptance: My solitary trauelling he oft bewai∣led, wishing me to desist, and neuer attempt such a voyage; but I giuing him absolute and constant answeres, appeased his imagined sorrow.</P>
<P>The affable dealing of this stranger made me remember the kindnesse of my aforesaid Countrey-man, M. <HI>Arthur,</HI> whose externall shew (for that time wee trauelled sociably together) gaue me the déepe measure of his internall affe∣ction: for as man oweth no lesse to his natiue Countrey, then what his breath and bloud are worth; so I, for many weighty considerations (and especially for that high respect) indeuoured my selfe to the vtmost of my power, to attempt this fastidious wandring, whereby I might manifest to my natiues, that zeale I bore, in vndertaking such dangers (as it were) for that neuer-conquered kingdomes sake; leauing him to bee the last witnesse of that innated duety, which I did owe vnto my deerest Nation, whether I returned or died in my atchieuements. I also recall our discontented parting at <HI>Venice,</HI> ingendred diuers languishing conceits, which I stroue to mitigate by odde deuised merriments; yet notwithstanding could not well expell his melancholy: for often at our encontrings before into <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> I haue heard him sigh in a most melancholious humour, which (as I did coniecture) was for some loue-sicke pas∣sion, or some such like male-contentment, that had en∣forced him in pilgrimage, two times to crosse the snowy Alpes.</P>
<P><HI>Zara</HI> is the Capitall Citie of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> called of old <HI>Ia∣dara:</HI> The inhabitants are gouerned by a <HI>Camarlingo,</HI> in the behalfe of <HI>Venice</HI>: the walles whereof are strongly rampired with earth, surpassing the toppes of the stone-worke: and fortified also with high Bulwarkes, and plan∣ted Canons on eleuated rampires of earth: which are aboue forty cubits higher then the walles and bulwars, standing in the foure seuerall corners of the Citie,</P>
<P>There lie continually in it, a great garrison of Soldiers,
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>
to defend the Towne and Citizens, who are maintained by the Duke of <HI>Venice:</HI> for he is Seignior thereof. They haue endured many inuasions of the Turkes, especially in the yeare 1570, when for the space of fouretéene Mo∣neths they were daily molested and besieged, but the vi∣ctory fell euer to the Christians. If the Turkes could winne this place, they might easily command the <HI>Adriati∣call</HI> Seas, in regard of that faire hauen which is there, to receiue Shippes and Gallies: which maketh the <HI>Venetians</HI> not a little fearefull. Yet they licentiate the neighbouring Infidels to traffique with them; but when they enter the gates, they must deliuer their Weapons to the Corporall of the squadron company. Neither may they stay within all night, vnder the paine of imprisonment. <HI>Dalmatia</HI> was called so of <HI>Mauritius</HI> the Emperour. The foure prin∣cipall Prouinces whereof are these, <HI>Atheos, Senebico, Spallato,</HI> and <HI>Tragurio.</HI> A part of which belongeth to <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI> another part to the Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> and the third part vnto the Turkes. <HI>Zara</HI> is distant from <HI>Venice</HI> 200 miles.</P>
<P>From <HI>Zara</HI> I embarked in a small Frigot, bound for <HI>Le∣sina,</HI> with fiue <HI>Slauonian</HI> Mariners: who sometimes sai∣led, and sometimes rowed with their oares. In our way we past by the Ile of <HI>Brazza,</HI> which is of no great quan∣tity, but fertile enough for the Inhabitants, and kept by a Gentleman of <HI>Venice.</HI> It lieth in the mouth of the gulfe <HI>Narento,</HI> that diuideth <HI>Dalmatia</HI> from <HI>Slauonia:</HI> Many conceiue in effect, that these two kingdomes are all one: but I hold the contrary opinion, both by experience, and by ancient Authors. Hauing passed <HI>Capo di Costa,</HI> which is the beginning of <HI>Slauonia,</HI> I saw vpon my right hand, a round rocke of a great height, in forme of a Pyramide: It is cognominated by Easterne Mariners, <HI>Pomo,</HI> anciently <HI>Salyro,</HI> for the good Faulcons that are bred therein. It standeth in the middest of the gulfe betweene <HI>Slauonia</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>A little beyond that rocke I saw the thrée Iles <HI>Trimiti</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Iles Tre¦miti.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="18" REF="13"/>
the chiefest whereof is called <HI>Teucria,</HI> but they are vulgar∣ly called the Iles of <HI>Diomedes,</HI> who was King of <HI>Etolla.</HI> They are right opposite to Mount <HI>Gargano,</HI> now called S. <HI>Angelo,</HI> and distant from the maine land of <HI>Pulia</HI> in <HI>Ita∣ly</HI> about nine miles.</P>
<P>The poore <HI>Slauonians</HI> beeing fatigated in their hunger-starued-Boat, with extraordinary paines, (for wee had thrée dayes calme, which is not vsually séene in these seas) were inforced to repose all night in the barren Ile of Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> this Ile is of circuit foure miles, but not inhabi∣ted. The excessiue raine that fell in the euening, made vs goe on shore to séeke the couerture of some rocke; which found, wee lay all night on hard stones, and with hungry bellies: for our prouision was spent. The breach of day gi∣uing comfort to our distressed bodies with fauourable windes at the <HI>Garbo è ponente,</HI> we set forward, and about mid-day we arriued in the port of <HI>Lesina,</HI> of which the Ile taketh the name.</P>
<P>This Ile of <HI>Lesina</HI> is of circuit 150 miles, and is the biggest Iland in the Adriaticke sea: it is excéeding fertile, and yéeldeth all things plentifully that is requisitite for the sustenance of man. This Citie is vnwalled, and of no great quantitie, but they haue a strong fortresse, which de∣fendeth the towne, the Hauen, and the vessels in the road. The Gouernor who was a <HI>Venetian,</HI> after he had enqui∣red of my intended voyage, most courteously inuited mee three times to his table, in the time of my fiue dayes stay∣ing there. And at the last méeting hée reported the Story of a maruellous mis-shapen creature borne in that Iland, asking, if I would go thither to sée it: Wherewith (when I perfectly vnderstood the matter) I was contented: the Gentleman honoured mee also with his company, and a horse to ride on, where when wee came, the Captaine cal∣led for the father of that Monster,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Monster borne in Le∣sina.</HI></NOTE> to bring him forth be∣fore vs. Which vnnaturall childe being brought, I was amazed in that sight, to behold the deformitie of Nature; for below the middle part there was but one body, and a∣boue
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
the middle there was two liuing soules, each one se∣parated from another with seuerall members. Their heads were both of one bignesse, but different in Phisnomy: the belly of the one ioyned with the posterior part of the other, and their faces looked both on one way, as if the one had carried the other on his back, and often before our eyes, he that was behinde, would lay his hands about the necke of the formost. Their eyes were excéeding bigge, and their hands greater then an infants of three times their age: the excrements of both creatures issued forth at one place, and their thighes and legges of a great growth, not semblable to their age, being but sixe and thirty dayes old; and their féet were proportionably made like the foote of a Cammell, round, and slouen in the middest. They receiued their food with an insatiable desire, and continually mourned with a pittifull noyse; that sorrowfull man told vs, that when the one slept, the other awaked, which was a strange disa∣gréement in nature.</P>
<P>The Mother of them bought déerely that birth, with the losse of her owne life; and as her husband reported, vn∣speakable was the torment she endured, in that woe∣full-wrestling paine. I was also informed afterwardes, that this one, or rather two-fold wretch, liued but a short while.</P>
<P>Leauing this monstrous shapen Monster to the owne strange and almost incredible natiuity, we returned to <HI>Lesina.</HI> But by the way of our backe-comming, I remem∣ber that worthy Gentleman shewed mee the ruines of an old house, where the noble King <HI>Demetrius</HI> was borne; and after I had yéelded my bounden and dutifull thankes vnto his generous minde, I hired a Fisher-boat to go ouer to <HI>Clyssa,</HI> being 12 miles distant. This Ile of <HI>Clyssa</HI> is of length twenty, and of circuit thréescore miles: it is beauti∣fied with two profitable Sea-ports, and vnder the Seig∣niorie of <HI>Venice.</HI> There are indifferent good commodities therein; vpon the South-side of this Iland lyeth the Ile <HI>Pelagusa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="14"/>Departing from thence in a <HI>Carmoesalo</HI> bound to <HI>Ragu∣sa,</HI> wee sailed by the thrée Iles, <HI>Brisca, Placa, Igezi;</HI> and when we entred in the gulfe of <HI>Cataro,</HI> we fetched vp the sight of the Ile <HI>Melida,</HI> called of old <HI>Meligna:</HI> Before wee could attaine vnto the Hauen, wherein our purpose was to stay all night, we were assailed on a sudden with a dead∣ly storme: In so much, that euery swallowing waue threatned our death, and bred in our breasts an intermin∣gled sorrow of feare and hope. The windes becomming calme, and our desired safety enioyed, we set forward in the gulfe of <HI>Cataro,</HI> and sailed by the Ile <HI>Curzola:</HI> In this Iland I saw a Walled Towne called <HI>Curzola,</HI> which hath two strong fortresses to guard it. It is both commodi∣ous for the traffique of Merchandise they haue, and also for the fine wood that groweth there, whereof the <HI>Veneti∣an</HI> Shippes and Gallies are made: An Iland no lesse de∣lightfull then profitable; and the two Gouernors thereof are changed euery eightéene moneths, by the State of <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI></P>
<P>It was of old called, <HI>Curcura, Melana,</HI> and of some <HI>Cor∣cira nigra,</HI> but by the Modernes, <HI>Curzola.</HI> Continuing our course, we passed by the Iles, <HI>Sabionzello, Torquol∣la,</HI> and <HI>Catza Augusta,</HI> appertaining to the Republicke of <HI>Ragusa.</HI> They are all three well inhabited, and fruitfull, yeelding cornes, wines, and certaine rare kinds of excellent fruits. It is dangerous for great vessels to come neere their coasts, because of the hidden shelues that lye off in the Sea, called <HI>Augustini,</HI> where diuers shippes haue been cast away in foule weather; vpon the second day after our loo∣sing from <HI>Clyssa,</HI> we arriued at <HI>Ragusa.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ragusa.</HI></NOTE><HI>Ragusa</HI> is a Common-weale, gouerned by Senators, and a Senate Councell: it is wonderfull strong, and also well guarded, being situate by the sea side, it hath a fine ha∣uen, and many goodly ships thereunto belonging.

<P>The next two speciall Cities in that Kingdome, are <HI>Sa∣benica,</HI> and <HI>Salona.</HI> The <HI>Slauonians</HI> are of a robust nature, martiall, and valiant fellowes, and a great helpe to main∣taine the right and liberty of the <HI>Venetian</HI> state.

<P>In all this way we found no Iland, but sayled along the maine Land of the <HI>Ilirian</HI> shore: hauing passed the Gulfe of <HI>Cataro,</HI> and <HI>Capo di Fortuna,</HI> I saw <HI>Castello nouo,</HI> which is a strong Fortresse, situate on the top of a Rocke: where∣in one <HI>Barbarisso,</HI> the Captaine of <HI>Solyman,</HI> starued to death foure thousand Spaniards.

These Castles are inaccessible, and vnconquerable, if that the Keepers bee loyall, and prouided with naturall and martiall furniture.

Resolution being, by the amazed Maister, demanded of euery man what was best to do; some replyed one way, and some another: In∣somuch that the most part of the passengers, gaue counsell, rather to render, then fight; being confident, their friends would pay their ransome, and so releiue them. But I, the wandring Pilgrime, pondring in my pensiue breast, my solitary estate, the distance of my Country and Friends, could conceiue no hope of deliuerance. Upon the which troublesome and fearefull appearance of slauery, I abso∣lutely arose, and spoke to the Maister, saying: <HI>The halfe of the Carmoesalo is your owne, and the most part also of the loading</HI> (all which hée had told mee before) <HI>Wherefore my counsell is, that you prepare your selfe to fight, and goe encourage your passengers, promise to your Mariners dou∣ble wages, make ready your two peeces of Ordinance, your Muskets, Powder, Lead, and halfe-pikes: For who knoweth, but the Lord may deliuer vs from the thraldome of these Infidels.</HI> My exhortation ended, hee was greatly animated therewith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A preparation to fight.</HI></NOTE> and gaue me thankes; whereupon, assembling the passengers and Mariners, hee gaue good comfort, and large promises to them all: So that their affrighted hopes were conuerted to a couragious resoluti∣on; seeming rather to giue the first assault, then to receiue the second wrong.</P>
<P>To performe the plots of our defence, euery man was busie in the worke, some below in the Gunner-roome, others cleansing the Muskets, some preparing the powder and Balles, some dressing the halfe-pikes, and others ma∣king fast the dores aboue: for so the Maister resolued to make combate below, both to saue vs from small shot, and besides for boording vs on a sodaine. The dexterous cou∣rage of all men was so forward to defend their liues and liberty, that truely in my opinion wee seemed thrise as many as we were. All things below and aboue being cun∣ningly

perfected, and euery one ranked in order with his Harquebuse and Pike, to stand on the Centenall of his owne defence, wee recommended our selues into the hands of the Almighty, and in the meane while attended their fiery salutations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The assault of a Turkish Gal∣ley.</HI></NOTE>In a furious spleene, the first <HI>Hola</HI> of their courtesies, was the progresse of a martiall conflict, thundring forth a terrible noise of Gally-roaring péeces. And wee in a sad reply, sent out a backe-sounding eccho of fiery-flying shots, which made an equiuox to the clouds, rebounding backe-ward in our perturbed breasts, the ambiguous sounds of feare and hope. After a long and doubtfull fight, both with great and small shot (night parting vs) the Turkes retired till morning, and then were mindefull to giue vs the new rancounter of a second Alarme. But, as it pleased him, who neuer faileth his, to send downe an vnre∣sistable tempest; about the breake of day we escaped their furious designes, and were enforced to seeke into the bay of <HI>Largostolo</HI> in <HI>Cephalonia</HI>; both because of the violent weather, and also for that a great leake was stricken into our ship.

Gallies assembled, in the yeare 1571 when they came to abate the rage of the great Turkes <HI>Armado</HI>; which, at that time lay in <HI>Peterasso,</HI> in the firme land of <HI>Greece,</HI> and had made conquest the yeare before, of noble <HI>Cyprus</HI> from the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>This Ile of <HI>Cephalonia</HI> was formerly called <HI>Ithaca,</HI> and greatly renowmed, because it was the heretable Kingdome of the worthy <HI>Vlysses,</HI> who excelled all other <HI>Greekes</HI> in eloquence and subtlety of wit.

The commo∣dity of which redounds yearely to the <HI>Veneians</HI>; for they are Signiors thereof.</P>
<P>Leauing this weather-beaten <HI>Carmoesalo,</HI> laid vp to a full Sea, I tooke purpose to trauell through the Iland: In the first daies iourney, I past by many fine Uillages, and pleasant fields, especially the vale <HI>Alessandro,</HI> where the <HI>Greekes</HI> told me, their Ancestors were vanquished in battell by the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Conquerour. They also shewed me, on the top of Mount <HI>Gargasso,</HI> the ruines of that Tem∣ple, which had beene of old dedicate to <HI>Iupiter:</HI> And vp∣on the second day I hired two Fisher-men in a little Boat, to carry mee ouer to <HI>Zante,</HI> being twenty fiue miles di∣stant.</P>
<P>The Ile of <HI>Zante</HI> was called <HI>Zachinthus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zante.</HI></NOTE> because so was called the son of <HI>Dardanus,</HI> who raigned there.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The battell betweene the Christians and Turkes at Le∣panto.</HI></NOTE>In the yeare 1571, and the sixth of October, <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> Generall for the Spanish Gallies, <HI>Marco An∣tonio Colonna,</HI> for Pope <HI>Pio Quinto</HI>; and <HI>Sebastiano Ve∣nieco</HI> for the Uenetian Army, conuened altogether in <HI>Lar∣gostolo</HI> at <HI>Cephalonia:</HI> hauing of all 208 Gallies, sixe Galleasses, and fiue and twenty Frigotes. After a most resolute deliberation, these thrée Generals went with a valiant courage to encounter with the Turkish <HI>Armado,</HI> on the Sunday morning, the seuenth of October; who in the end, through the helpe of Christ, obtained a glorious victorie. In that fight there was taken and drowned 180. of Turkish Gallies; and there escaped about the number of sixe hundred and fifty Shippes, Gallies, Galeots, and other Uessels: There was fiftéene thousand Turkes kil∣led, and foure thousand taken prisoners, and twelue thou∣sand Christians deliuered from their slauish bondage.

all, the Christians loosed but eleuen Gallies, and fiue thou∣sand slaine. At their returne to <HI>Largostolo,</HI> after this victorious battell, the thrée Generals diuided innumera∣ble spoyles, to their well-deseruing Captaines, and worthy Souldiers.</P>
<P>After my arriuall in <HI>Peterasso,</HI> the Metropolitan of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> I left the turmoyling dangers of the intri∣cated Iles of the <HI>Ionean</HI> and <HI>Adriaticall</HI> Seas, and aduised to trauaile in the firme Land of <HI>Greece,</HI> with a Carauan of <HI>Greekes,</HI> that was bound for <HI>Athens.</HI> But before hee ad∣mitted mee into his company, hee was wonderfull inqui∣sitiue, for what cause I trauelled alone, and of what Na∣tion I was? To whom I soberly excused, and discouered my selfe with modest answeares: Which pacified his cu∣riosity, but not his auaritious minde; for vnder a preten∣ded protection he had of mee, he extorted the most part of my money from my purse, without any regard of con∣science.</P>
<P>In the first, second, and third daies iournying, wee had faire way, hard lodging, but good cheere, and kinde enter∣taiment for our money: But on the fourth day, when we entred in the Hilly and barren Country of <HI>Arcadia</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Although Ar∣cadia in for∣mer times was pleasant, yet it is now for the most part, wast and disinhabi∣ted.</HI></NOTE> where, for a daies iourney we had no village, but saw aboundance of Cattell without keepers. In this Desart way, I be∣held many singular Monuments and ruinous Castles, whose names I knew not, because I had an ignorant guide: But this I remember, amongst these Rockes, my belly was pinched, and wearied was my body, with the cli∣ming of fastidious Mountaines, which bred no small griefe to my breast. Yet notwithstanding of my distresse, the remembrance of those sweete seasoned Songs, of <HI>Ar∣cadian</HI> Shepeheards which pregnant Poets haue so well penned, did recreate my fatigated corps, with many sugred suppositions. These sterile bounds being past, wee entred in the Easterne plaine of <HI>Morea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lacedemon in Sparta.</HI></NOTE> called aunciently <HI>Spar∣ta,</HI> where that, sometimes, famous Citie of <HI>Lacedemon</HI> flourished, but now sacked, and the lumps of ruines and

Marching thus, we left <HI>Mode∣na,</HI> and <HI>Napoli,</HI> on our right hand, toward the Sea-side, and on the sixt day at night, wee pitched our Tents in the disinhabited Uillages of <HI>Argo</HI> and <HI>Micene,</HI> from the which, vnhappy <HI>Helene</HI> was rauished. Heere I had the ground to be a pillow, and the world-wide-fields to bee a Chamber, the whirling-windy-skies, to bee a roofe to my Winter-blasted lodging, and the humide vapours of cold <HI>Nocturna,</HI> to accompany the vnwished-for-bed of my re∣pose.</P>
<P>In all this Country I could find nothing, to answere the famous relations, giuen by ancient Authors, of the ex∣cellency of that Land, but the name onely; the barbarous∣nesse of Turkes and Time, hauing defaced all the Monu∣ments of Antiquity: No shew of honour, no habitation of men in an honest fashion, nor possessours of the Country in a Principalitie. But rather prisoners shut vp in pri∣sons, or addicted slaues to cruell and tyrannicall Maisters: So deformed is the state of that once worthy Realme, and so miserable is the burthen of that afflicted people: Which, and the apparance of that permanency, grieued my heart to behold the sinister working of blind Fortune, which al∣waies plungeth the most renowmed Champions and their memory, in the profoundest pit of all extremities and ob∣liuion.</P>
<P>Departing from <HI>Argo,</HI> vpon the seuenth day we arriued at <HI>Athens: Athens</HI> is still inhabited, standing in the East part of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> neere to the Frontiers of <HI>Macedon:</HI> It was first called <HI>Cecropia,</HI> and lastly <HI>Athens</HI> of <HI>Minerua.</HI> This Citie was the mother and wel-spring of all liberall Artes and Sciences,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Athens.</HI></NOTE> but now altogether decayed: The cir∣cuit of old <HI>Athens</HI> hath béen, according to the fundamentall walles yet extant, about sixe Italian miles, but now of no great quantity, nor many dwelling houses therein.

<P>After my redounded thankes, they hauing returned, the contemplation on their curtesies brought me in remem∣brance, how curious the old <HI>Athenians</HI> were to heare of forraigne newes, and with what great regard and estima∣tion they honored trauellers. <HI>Serigo</HI> is an Iland in the sea <HI>Cretico:</HI> it was anciently called <HI>Cytherea</HI> of <HI>Cythero</HI> the sonne of <HI>Phaenise</HI>: and of <HI>Aristotle Porphyris,</HI> or <HI>Schotera,</HI> in respect of the fine marble that is got there. It is of cir∣cuit 60 miles, hauing but one Castle called <HI>Capsallo,</HI> which is kept by a <HI>Venetian</HI> Captaine. Here it is said, that <HI>Venus</HI> did first inhabit, and I saw the ruines of her demolished Temple on the side of a mountaine yet extant. A little more downward below this Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> are the re∣liques of that Palace, wherein <HI>Menelaus</HI> did dwell, who was King of <HI>Sparta,</HI> and Lord of this Ile. The <HI>Greekes</HI> of the Ile told mee, there were wilde Asses there, who had a stone in their heads, which was a soueraigne remedy for the falling sicknesse, and good to make a woman be quickly de∣liuered of her birth.</P>
<P>In the time of my abode, at the village of <HI>Capsalo</HI> (be∣ing a hauen for small barkes, and situate below the Castle) the Captaine of that same fortresse kild a Seminary Priest whom he had found in the night with his whoore in a Bro∣thel-house:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Priest killed in a Brothell-house, lying with a whoore.</HI></NOTE> for the which sacrilegious murther, the Go∣uernor of the Ile deposed the Captaine, and banished him, causing a boat to be prepared to send him to <HI>Creta.</HI> O, if all the Priests which do commit incest, adultery, and fornica∣tion, (yea and worse, <HI>Il peccato carnale contra natura</HI>) were thus handled, and seuerely rewarded; what a sea of Sodo∣miticall irreligious bloud would ouer-flow the halfe of Eu∣rope, to staine the spotted colour of that Romane Beast. Truly, and yet more, these lasciuious Friers are the very Epicures, or off-scourings of the earth; for how oft haue I

<P>The aforesaid <HI>Carabusa</HI> is the principal fortresse of <HI>Cre∣ta,</HI> being of it selfe inuincible, and is not vnlike to the Ca∣stle of <HI>Dunbertan,</HI> which standeth at the mouth of <HI>Clyd</HI>; vpon which riuer the most worthy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The old and famous Citie of Lanerke.</HI></NOTE> renowned, and anci∣ently enobled Citie of <HI>Lanerke</HI> is situated. For it is inuiro∣ned with a rocke higher then the walles, and ioyneth with <HI>Capo Ermico:</HI> hauing learned of the théeuish way I had to <HI>Canea,</HI> I aduised to put my money in exchange, which the Captaine of that strength very curteously performed; and would also haue disswaded me from my purpose, but I by no perswasion of him would stay. From thence departing,

scarcely was I aduanced twelue miles in my way, when I was beset on the skirt of a rockie mountaine, with three <HI>Greeke Renegadoes,</HI> and an <HI>Italian Bandido:</HI> who laying hands pn me, beat mee most cruelly, robbed me of all my clothes, and stripped me naked, vsing many inuectiue spée∣ches. At last the <HI>Italian</HI> perceiuing I was a stranger, and could not speake the <HI>Cretan</HI> tongue, began to aske mee in his owne language, where was my money? To whom I soberly answered, I had no more then he saw, which was foure score bagantines: but he not giuing credit to these words, searched all my cloathes and <HI>Budgeto,</HI> yet found nothing except my linnen, and letters of recommendation, I had from diuers Princes of Christendome: which when he saw, did moue him to compassion, and earnestly intrea∣ted the other thrée theeues to grant me mercy, and saue my life. A long deliberation being ended, they restored backe a∣gaine my Pilgrimes cloathes, and letters, but my blew Gowne and Bagantines they kept. Such also was their théeuish curtesie towards me, that for my better safe-guard in the way, they gaue me a stamped péece of clay, as a token to shew any of their companions, if I encountred with them; for they were about twenty rascals of a confederate band,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A happy deli∣uerance from Theeues.</HI></NOTE> that lay in this desart passage. Leauing them, with many counterfet thankes, I trauelled that day seuen and thirty miles, and at night attained to the vnhappy village of <HI>Pickehorno,</HI> where I could haue neither meate, drinke, lodging, nor any refreshing to my wearied body. These des∣perate <HI>Candiots</HI> thronged about me gazing (as though a∣stonished) to sée mee both want company, and their lan∣guage, and by their cruell lookes they séemed to be a barba∣rous and vnciuill people: For all these High-landers of <HI>Candy</HI> are tyrannicall, blood-thirsty and deceitfull. The consideration of which made me to shun their villany, and priuatly sought for a secure place of repose in a darke caue by the sea side; in which I lay till morning with a crazed body, and a hungry belly.</P>
<P>Upon the appearing of the next <HI>Aurora,</HI> I embraced my
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>
vnknowne way, and about mid-day came to <HI>Canea: Ca∣nea</HI> is the second Citie of <HI>Creet,</HI> excéeding populous, well-walled, and fortified with Bulwarkes: It hath a large ca∣stle, containing ninty seuen Palaces, in which the Rector and other <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentlemen dwell. There lie continu∣ally in it seuen Companies of Souldiers, who keep Cente∣nall on the walles, guard the gates, and market-places of the Citie: Neither in this towne nor <HI>Candia,</HI> may any Countrey Peasant enter with weapons (especially Har∣quebuses) for that conceited feare they haue of treason. Truely this City may equall in strength, either <HI>Zara</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> or <HI>Luka,</HI> or <HI>Ligorne,</HI> both in <HI>Tuscana:</HI> for these foure Cities are so strong,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Foure strong Citie.</HI></NOTE> that in all my trauels I neuer saw them matched. They are all well prouided with Artil∣lery, and all necessary things for their defence, especially <HI>Lu∣ka,</HI> which continually reserues in store prouision of victuals for 12 yeares siege. Being here disappointed of transporta∣tion to <HI>Archipelago,</HI> I aduised to visit <HI>Candy</HI>; and in my way I saw the large hauen of <HI>Suda,</HI> which hath no town or village, saue onely a castle situated on a rocke in the sea, at the entry of the Bay: the bounds of that harbour may re∣ceiue at one time aboue 2000 ships and gallies, and is the onely key of the Iland: for which place the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath oft offered an infinite deale of mony to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> whereby his nauy which sometimes resort in the <HI>Leuante,</HI> might haue accesse and reliefe; but they would neuer grant him his request.</P>
<P>Upon the third dayes iourney from <HI>Canea,</HI> I came to <HI>Rethimos</HI>; This Citie is somwhat ruinous and vnwalled, but the Citizens haue newly builded a strong Fortresse, which defendeth them from the inuasion of Pirates. It standeth by the Sea side, and in the yeare 1597, it was mi∣serably sacked and burned with Turkes. Continuing my voyage, I passed along the skirt of mount <HI>Ida,</HI> accompani∣ed with <HI>Greekes</HI> who could speake the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue, on which first they shewed me y<SUP>e</SUP> caue of king <HI>Minos,</HI> but some hold it to be the sepulcher of <HI>Iupiter.</HI> This <HI>groto</HI> is of length
<PB N="34" REF="21"/>
80 paces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Minos.</HI></NOTE> and 8 large. This <HI>Minos</HI> was said to be the bro∣ther of <HI>Radamanthus,</HI> and <HI>Sarpedon;</HI> who, after their suc∣cession to the kingdome, established such equitable lawes, that by Poets they are faigned to be the Iudges of Hell. I saw also there, the place where <HI>Iupiter</HI> (as they say) was nourished by <HI>Amalthes,</HI> which by <HI>Greekes</HI> is recited, as wel as <HI>Latine</HI> Poets.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saturne.</HI></NOTE>Thirdly, they shewed me the Temple of <HI>Saturne,</HI> which is a worke to be admired, of such Antiquity, and as yet vn∣decayed; who, (say they) was the first King that inhabi∣ted there. And néere to it, is the demolished Temple of <HI>Matelia,</HI> hauing this superscription aboue the doore yet to be séene: <HI>Make cleane your feet, wash your head, and enter.</HI> Fourthly, I saw the entry to the Laborinth of <HI>Dedalus,</HI> which I would gladly haue better viewed, but because we had no candle-light we durst not enter: for there are many hollow places within it, so that if a man stumble or fall, hee can hardly be rescued. It is cut forth with many intri∣cating wayes, on the face of a little Hill, ioyning with Mount <HI>Ida.</HI></P>
<P>Mount <HI>Ida</HI> is the highest mountaine in <HI>Creta,</HI> and by the computation of Shéepheards féete, amounteth to six miles of height. It is ouer-clad euen to the toppe with Cypre∣trées, and good store of medicinable hearbes: insomuch that the beasts which féede thereupon, haue their téeth guil∣ded like to the colour of gold. It is said by some Histo∣rians that no venemous animall can liue in this Ile; but I saw the contrary: for I kild vpon one day, two Serpents and a Uiper: Wherefore many build vpon false reports, but experience teacheth men the truth. Des∣cending from this mountaine, I entred in a faire plaine, beautified with many villages; in one of which I found a <HI>Grecian</HI> Bishop, who kindly presented with grapes of <HI>Maluasie,</HI> and other things, for it was in the time of Uin∣tage. To carry these things he had giuen me, he caused to make ready an Asse, and a seruant, who went with mee to <HI>Candy,</HI> which was more then 15 miles from his house.

True it is, that the best sort of <HI>Greekes,</HI> in visiting other, do not vse to come empty handed, neither will they suffer a stranger to depart without both gifts and conuoy.</P>
<P><HI>Candy</HI> is a large and famous Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Candie.</HI></NOTE> situated on a plaine by the sea side, hauing a goodly hauen for ships, and a faire Arsenall wherein are 36 Gallies. It is excéeding strong, and daily guarded with 2000 Souldiers, and the Walles in compasse are about three leagues. <HI>Candy</HI> is distant from <HI>Venice</HI> 1300 miles, from <HI>Constantinople</HI> 700. from <HI>Fa∣magosta</HI> in <HI>Cyprus</HI> 600. from <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> 500. and from the Citie of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> 900 miles. The <HI>Candeots</HI> through all the Iland, make muster euery eighth day, be∣fore the Sergeant-Maiors, or Officers of the Generall, and are well prouided with all sorts of Armour; yea, and the most valourous people that hight the name of <HI>Greekes.</HI> It was told me by the Rector of <HI>Candy,</HI> that they may raise in Armes of the inhabitants (not reckoning the Garrisons) aboue sixtie thousand men, all able for warres, with 54 Gallies, and 24 Galleots for the sea. In all my trauels through this Realme, I neuer could sée a <HI>Greek</HI> come forth of his house vnarmed: and after such a martiall manner, that one his head he weareth a bare stéele Cap, a Bow in his hand, a long sword by his side, a broad ponyard ouer∣thwart his belly, and a round target hanging at his girdle. They are not costly in apparrell, for they were but linnen cloathes, and vse no shooes, but Bootes of white leather: by nature they are crafty and subtill, as <HI>Paul</HI> mentioneth, <HI>Titus.</HI> 1.12. Their haruest is our Spring: for they manure the ground, and sow the séed in October, which is reaped in March and Aprill. Being frustrate of my intention at <HI>Candy,</HI> I was forced to returne to <HI>Canea,</HI> where I staied 25 dayes before I could get passage, for I purposed to view <HI>Constantinople.</HI> I trauelled on foot in this Ile more then 400 miles; and vpon the 50 day after my first comming to <HI>Carabusa,</HI> I embarked in a fisher-boat that belonged to <HI>Mi∣lo,</HI> being a hundred miles distant, which had beene violent∣ly driuen thither with stormy weather.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="22"/><HI>Milo</HI> was called by <HI>Aristotle, Melada;</HI> and by others, <HI>Mi∣malida, Melos:</HI> And lastly, <HI>Milo,</HI> because of the fine Mill∣stones that are got there, which are transported to <HI>Con∣stantinople, Greece</HI> and <HI>Natolia.</HI> This Ile is one of the Iles <HI>Cyclades,</HI> or <HI>Sporades,</HI> but more commonly <HI>Archipe∣lago,</HI> or the Arch-ilands, and standeth in the beginning of the <HI>Aegean</HI> sea: The inhabitants are <HI>Greekes,</HI> but slaues to the Turke, and so are all the 53 Iles of the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> saue onely <HI>Tino,</HI> which holdeth of the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Milo.</HI></NOTE>From <HI>Milo</HI> I came to <HI>Zephano,</HI> an Iland of circuit a∣bout twenty miles: The inhabitants are poore, yet kind people. There are an infinite number of Partridges with∣in this Ile, of a reddish colour, and bigger then ours in <HI>Bri∣taine:</HI> they are wilde, and onely kild by small shot; but I haue seene in other Ilands flockes of them feeding in the fields, and vsually kept by children: some others I haue seene in the stréetes of villages, without any kéeper, euen as Hennes do with vs. I saw fountains here that natural∣ly yéeld fine oyle, which is the greatest aduantage the Ilan∣ders haue.</P>
<P>From thence I embarked, and arriued at <HI>Angusa</HI> in <HI>Pa∣rir:</HI> This Ile is forty miles long,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parir.</HI></NOTE> and six miles broad: be∣ing plentifull enough in all necessary things for the vse of of man: In <HI>Angusa</HI> I stayed 16 dayes, storme-sted, with Northerly windes; and in all that time I neuer came in bed: for my lodging was in a little Church without the vil∣lage, on hard stones; where I also had a fire, and dressed my meate. The <HI>Greekes</HI> visited me oftentimes, and intreated me aboue all things, I should not enter within the bounds of their Sanctuary, because I was not of their Religion. These miserable Ilanders are a kinde of silly poore people; which in their behauiour shewed the necessity they had to liue, rather then any pleasure in their liuing. From thence I arriued in the Ile of <HI>Mecano,</HI> where I but onely dined, &amp; so set forward to <HI>Zea. Zea</HI> was so called of <HI>Zeo,</HI> the son of <HI>Phebo;</HI> and of some <HI>Tetrapoli</HI>; because of the foure Citties that were there of old. <HI>Symonides</HI> the Poet, and <HI>Eristato</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>
the excellent Physition, were borne in it. The next Ile of any note wee touched at, was <HI>Tino:</HI> This Iland is vnder the Signorie of <HI>Venice,</HI> and was sometimes beau∣tified with the Temple of <HI>Neptune.</HI> By <HI>Aristotle</HI> it was <HI>Idrusa</HI>; of <HI>Demosthenes,</HI> and <HI>Eschines, Erusea:</HI> It hath an impregnable Castle, builded on the top of a high Rocke; so that the Turkes by no meanes can con∣quer it.</P>
<P>From this Ile I came to <HI>Palmosa,</HI> sometime <HI>Pathmos,</HI> which is a Mountanous and barren Iland: It was heere that Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> wrote the <HI>Reuelation</HI> after hée was bani∣shed by <HI>Domitianus</HI> the Emperour. Thence I embarked to <HI>Nicaria,</HI> and sailed by the Ile <HI>Scyro</HI>; which of old was the Signory of <HI>Licomedes,</HI> and in the habit of a woman, was <HI>Achilles</HI> brought vp heere: who in that time, begot <HI>Pyrhus</HI> vpon <HI>Deidamia,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Licomedes,</HI> and where the crafty <HI>Vlysses</HI> did discouer this fatall Prince to <HI>Troy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicaria.</HI></NOTE> As we fetched vp the sight of <HI>Nicaria,</HI> wee espied two Turkish Galleots, who gaue vs the Chace, and pur∣sued vs, straight vnto a bay, betwixt two Mountaines, where we left the loaded Boat, and fled to the Rockes: But in our flying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Greekes taken captiues.</HI></NOTE> the Maister was taken, and other two old men; whom they made captiues, and slaues: and also seized vpon the Boat, and all their goods: The number that escaped, were nine persons. This Ile <HI>Nicaria,</HI> was an∣ciently called <HI>Doliche,</HI> and <HI>Ithiosa,</HI> and is somewhat bar∣ren; hauing no Sea-port at all: It was heere, the Poets feigned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Icarus.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Icarus</HI> the son of <HI>Dedalus</HI> fell, when as hee took flight from <HI>Creta,</HI> with his borrowed wings, of whom it hath the name. Expecting certaine daies heere, in a vilage called <HI>Lephantos,</HI> for passage to <HI>Sio,</HI> at last I found a <HI>Bri∣gandino</HI> bound thither, that was come from the fruit∣full Ile of <HI>Stalimene,</HI> of old <HI>Lemnos,</HI> wherein I embarked, and sailed by the Ile <HI>Samos,</HI> which is opposite to <HI>Caria,</HI> in <HI>Asia Minor:</HI> It is of circuit one hundred and sixty, and of length forty miles: It was of old named <HI>Dri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa,</HI> and <HI>Melanphilo,</HI> in which was <HI>Phythagoras</HI> the Phylospher,

and <HI>Lycaon</HI> the excellent Musitien borne.</P>
<P>As wee left the Ile <HI>Veneco</HI> on our left hand, and entred in the Gulfe betweene <HI>Sio,</HI> and <HI>Eolida,</HI> there fell downe a deadly storme, at the <HI>Greco è Leuante,</HI> which split our Mast, carrying Sailes and all ouer-board: Whereupon euery man looked (as it were) with the stampe of death in his pale visage. The Tempest continuing (our Boat not being able to keepe the Seas) we were constrained to seeke into a creeke, betwixt two Rockes, for safety of our liues; where, when wee entred, there was no likely-hood of re∣liefe: for wee had a shelfie shore, and giuing ground to the Ankors they came both home. The sorrowfull Maister seeing nothing but shipwracke, tooke the Helme in hand, directing his course to rush vpon the face of a low Rocke, whereupon the Sea most fearefully broke. As wée touched, the Marriners contending who should first leape out, some fell ouer-boord, and those that got Land, were pulled backe by the reciprocating waues: Neither in all this time durst I once moue; for they had formerly sworne, if I pressed to escape, before the rest were first forth, they would throw me head-long into the Sea: So, being two waies in danger of death, I patiently offered vp my pray∣ers to God.</P>
<P>At our first incounter with the Rockes (our fore-deckes, and boates Gallery being broke, and a great leake made) the recoiling waues brought vs backe from the Shelfes a great way; which the poore Maister perceiuing, and that there were seuen men drowned, and eleuen persons aliue, cryed with a lowd voyce: <HI>Bee of good cheere, take vp Oares and row hastily; it may bee, before the Barke sinke, wee attaine to yonder Caue.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shipwracke.</HI></NOTE> Euery man working for his owne deliuerance (as it pleased God) we got the same with good fortune: for no sooner were wee dis-barked, but the Boat immediate sunke. There was nothing saued but my <HI>Coffino,</HI> which I kept alwaies in my Armes; for the which of my things, the <HI>Greekes</HI> were in admiration. In this Caue, which was thirty paces long, within the Moun∣taine,
<PB N="39" REF="23"/>
wee abode three daies, without both meate and drink: vpon the fourth day at Morne, the Tempest ceasing, there came Fisher-boates to relieue vs, who found the ten <HI>Greekes</HI> almost famished for lacke of food; but I in that hunger-staruing feare, fed vpon the expectation of my doubtfull reliefe. True it is, a miserable thing it is for a man, to grow an example to others, in matters of affliction, yet it is necessary that some men should be so: For it plea∣sed God, hauing showne a sensible disposition of fauor vp∣on mee, in humbling mee to the very pit of extremities, taught me also by such an expected deliuerance, both to put my confidence in his eternall goodnesse, and to know the frailty of my owne selfe, and my ambition, which draue me often to such disasters.</P>
<P>The dead men being found on shore, wee buried them; and I learned at that instant time, there were seuentéene boats cast away, on the Coast of this Iland, and neuer a man saued: in this place the <HI>Greekes</HI> set vp a stone Crosse in the memoriall of such a wofull mischance, and mourned heauily, fasting and praying. I reioycing, and thanking God for my safety (leauing them sorrowing for their friends and good) tooke iourney through the Iland to <HI>Sio,</HI> for so is the Citie called. In my way I past by an old Castle standing on a little Hill, named <HI>Gasbos,</HI> or <HI>Helias;</HI> where (as I was informed, by two <HI>Greekes</HI> in my compa∣ny) the Sepulchre of <HI>Homer</HI> was yet extant: For this is one of the seuen Iles that contended for his birth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Toombe of Homer.</HI></NOTE> And I willing to see it, entreated them to accompany me thither; where we came, wee descended by sixteene degrées into a darke Cell, and passing that, wee entred in another foure-squared roome, in which I saw an ancient Toomb, whereon were ingrauen <HI>Greeke</HI> letters, which wee could not vnderstand for their antiquity; but whether it was his Toombe or not, I do not know, but this they re∣lated.</P>

<P><HI>Greece</HI> of all the Kingdomes in <HI>Europe,</HI> hath beene most famous, and highly renowmed for many notable respects: It was first called <HI>Helles,</HI> next <HI>Grecia,</HI> of <HI>Grecus,</HI> who was once King thereof: The <HI>Greekes,</HI> of all other <HI>Gentiles,</HI> were the first conuerted Christians, and are wonderfull de∣uout in their professed Religion: The Priests weare the haire of their heads hanging ouer their shoulders: Those that bee the most sincere Religious men, abstaine alwaies from eating of flesh, contenting themselues with water, herbes, and bread: They differ much in ceremonies, and Principles of Religion, from the Papists, and the Com∣putation of their Kalender, is as ours. They haue foure Patriarkes, who gouerne the affaires of their Church, and also any ciuill dissentions, which happen amongst them, <HI>viz.</HI> one in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> another in <HI>Antiochia,</HI> the third in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and the fourth in <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> It is not néed∣full for mee to penetrate further in the condition of their estate, because it is no part of my intent in this Treatise. In <HI>Salonica</HI> I found a <HI>Germe,</HI> bound for <HI>Tenedos,</HI> in the which I embarked: As we sayled along the <HI>Thessalonian</HI> shoare, I saw the two topped Hill <HI>Pernassus,</HI> where it was said the nine <HI>Muses</HI> haunted;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pernassus.</HI></NOTE> but as for the Fountaine <HI>Helicon,</HI> I leaue that to be searched, and seene by the imagi∣nation

of Poets: For if it had béene obiected to my sight, like an insatiable drunkard, I should haue drunke vp the streames of Poesie, to haue enlarged my poore Poeticall veine.</P>
<P>The Mountaine it selfe is somewhat steepe, and sterile, especially the two toppes, the one whereof is dry, and sandy, signifying that Poets are alwaies poore and nee∣dy: The other toppe is barren, and rocky, resembling the ingratitude of wretched and niggardly Patrones: the vale betweene the toppes is pleasant, and profitable, deno∣ting the fruitfull and delightfull soyle, which paine∣full Poets, the <HI>Muses</HI> Plow-men, so industriously manure. A little more Eastward, as wee fetcht vp the Coast of <HI>Achaia,</HI> the Maister of the Uessell shewed mee a ruinous Uillage, and Castle, where hee said the admired Citie of <HI>Thebes</HI> had beene.</P>
<P>Upon the third day from <HI>Salonica,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thebes.</HI></NOTE> wee arriued in the roade of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> which is an Iland in the Sea <HI>Pontus,</HI> or <HI>Propontis:</HI> It hath a Citie called <HI>Tenedos,</HI> built by <HI>Tenes,</HI> which is a gallant place, hauing a Castle, and a faire Hauen for all sorts of Uessels: It produceth good store of Wines, and the best supposed to bee in all the South-east parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Iland is not big, but exceeding fertile, lying thrée miles from the place where <HI>Troy</HI> stood, as <HI>Virgill</HI> re∣ported, <HI>Aenid.</HI> 2.</P>
<Q><L>Est in conspectu Tenedos, notissima fama insula.</L></Q>
<P>In <HI>Tenedos</HI> I met by accident, two French Merchants of <HI>Marseills,</HI> intending for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who had lost their ship at <HI>Sio,</HI> when they were busie at venereall tilting, with their new elected Mistresses, and for a second remedy, were glad to come thither in a Turkish <HI>Carmoesalo.</HI> The like of this I haue séene fall out with Sea-faring men, Merchants, and Passengers, who buy sometimes their too much folly, with too déere a repentance. They, and I, re∣soluing to view <HI>Troy,</HI> did hire a <HI>Ianisarie</HI> to bee our con∣ductor and protector, and a <HI>Greeke</HI> to be our Interpreter. Where when we landed, wee saw heere and there many re∣licts

of old walles, as wee trauelled through these famous bounds. And as we were aduanced toward the East part of <HI>Troy,</HI> our <HI>Greek</HI> brought vs to many Toombes, which were mighty ruinous, and pointed vs particularly to the Toombes of <HI>Hector,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Toombes of Troians.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Aiax, Achilles, Troylus,</HI> and many other valiant Champions, with the Toombs also of <HI>Hecu∣ba, Cresseid,</HI> and other <HI>Troian</HI> Dames: Well I wot, I saw infinite old Sepulchres, but for their particular names, and nomination of them, I suspend, neither could I beléeue my Interpreter, sith it is more then thrée thousand and odde yeares ago, that <HI>Troy</HI> was destroyed: He shewed vs also the ruines of King <HI>Priams</HI> palace, and where <HI>Anchises</HI> the father of <HI>Aeneas</HI> dwelt. At the North-east corner of <HI>Troy,</HI> which is in sight of the Castles of <HI>Hellesponte,</HI> there is a gate yet standing, and a péece of a reasonable high wall; vpon which I found thrée péeces of rusted money, which afterward I gaue to the two yonger brethren of the Duke of <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A description of Troy.</HI></NOTE>Where the pride of <HI>Phrygia</HI> stood, it is a most delectable plaine, abounding now in cornes, fruites, and wines, and may be called the garden of <HI>Natolia:</HI> yet not populous, for there are but onely fiue scattered Uillages, in all that bounds: The length of <HI>Troy</HI> hath béene, as may bee dis∣cerned, by the fundamentall walles yet extant, about twen∣ty miles: the ruines of which are come to that Poeticall Prouerbe: <HI>Nunc seges est vbi Troia fuit.</HI></P>
<P>Leauing the fields of noble <HI>Ilium,</HI> wee crossed the Riuer of <HI>Simois,</HI> and dyned at a Uillage named <HI>Extetash:</HI> I re∣member, discharging one couenant with the <HI>Ianisary,</HI> who was not contented with the former condition, the French∣men making obstacle to pay that which I had giuen, the wrathfull <HI>Ianisary</HI> be laboured them both with a cudgel, till the bloud sprung from their heads, and compelled them to double his wages.

doubtlesse with strokes to giue twice as much: for they make no account of conscience, nor ruled by the law of compassion, neither regard they a Christian more then a dogge: but whatsoeuer extortion or iniurie they vse against him, he must be <HI>French</HI>-like contented, bowing his head, and making a counterfet shew of thankes, and happy too oftentimes, if so he escape.

But now they are com∣monly called the Castles of <HI>Gallipoly,</HI> yea, or rather the strength of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> betwéene which, no ship may enter, without knowledge of the Captaines.

<P>The first place of any note I saw, within these narrow Seas, was the auncient Citty of <HI>Gallipolis,</HI> the second seate of <HI>Thracia,</HI> which was first builded by <HI>Caius Caligu∣la,</HI> and sometimes hath béene inhabited by the <HI>Gaules:</HI> It was the first Towne in Europe that the Turkes conque∣red.

<HEAD>A briefe Description of the renow∣ned Citty of Constantinople, together with the customes, manners, and religion of the Turkes, their first beginning, and the birth of MAHOMET; and what opinion the Mahometanes haue of Heauen and Hell.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Onstantinople</HI> is the Metropolitan of <HI>Thra∣cia,</HI> so called of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour, who first enlarged the same: It was called of old <HI>Bizantium,</HI> but now by the Turkes <HI>Stambolda,</HI> which signifieth in their lan∣guage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first buil∣ding of Con∣stantinople.</HI></NOTE> a large Citty. It was also called <HI>E∣thuse,</HI> and by the <HI>Greekes Stymbolis.</HI> This Citty (accor∣ding to ancient Authors) was first sounded by the <HI>Lacede∣monians,</HI> who were conducted from <HI>Lacedemon,</HI> by one <HI>Pausanias,</HI> about the yeare of the world 3294, which after their consultation with <HI>Apollo,</HI> where they should settle their abode and dwelling place, they came to <HI>Bithinia,</HI> and builded a Cittie which was called <HI>Calcedon.</HI> But the com∣modity of fishing falling out contrary to their expectation, in respect the fishes were afraid of the white bankes of the Citty, the Captaine <HI>Pausanias</HI> left that place, and builded
<PB N="47" REF="27"/>
<HI>Bizantium</HI> in <HI>Thracia,</HI> which first was by him intituled <HI>Li∣gos.</HI> By <HI>Pliny, Iustine,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> it was surnamed <HI>Vrbs Illustrissima,</HI> because it is repleat with all the blessings earth can giue to man; yea and in the most fertile soile of <HI>Europe. Zonaras</HI> reporteth that the <HI>Athenians</HI> in an ambi∣tious and insatiable desire of Soueraigntie, wonno it from the <HI>Lacedemonians:</HI> they thus being vanquished, suborned <HI>Seuerus</HI> the <HI>Romane</HI> Emperour to besiege the same: but the Cittie <HI>Bizantium</HI> being strongly fortified with walles, the Romans could not take it in, vntill ex∣treame famine constrained them to yeeld after thrée yeares siege: And <HI>Seuerus</HI> to satisfie his cruelty, put all to the sword that were within,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bizantium ru∣ined by Seue∣rus the Empe∣rour.</HI></NOTE> and razed the walles, giuing it in possession to the neighbouring <HI>Perinthians.</HI> This Citie thus remained in calamitie till <HI>Constantine</HI> (resigning the Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Italy</HI> to the Popish in∣heritance of the Roman Bishops) reedified the same, and translated his Imperiall seate in the East, and reduced all the Empire of <HI>Greece</HI> to an vnite tranquility, with immor∣tall reputation, which the <HI>Parthians</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> had so mi∣serably disquieted.</P>
<P>But these disorders at length reformed by the seuere ad∣ministration of iustice, for the which, and other worthy re∣spects, the said <HI>Constantine,</HI> sonne of S. <HI>Helen,</HI> and Em∣perour of <HI>Rome,</HI> (which after the Popes vsurped) was surnamed the <HI>Great.</HI> He first in his plantation called this Citie <HI>New Rome;</HI> but when hee beheld the flourishing and multiplying of all things in it, and because of the commo∣dious situation thereof, he called it <HI>Constantinopolis,</HI> after his owne name. This Emperour liued there many pros∣perous yeares, in a most happy estate: Likewise many of his successors did, vntill such time that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the se∣cond of that name, and Emherour of the Turkes, liuing in a discontented humor, to behold the great and glorious do∣minions of Christians, especially this famous Citie, that so flourished in his eyes, by moment all circumstances, col∣lected his cruell intentions to the full height of ambition;
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
whereby hee might abolish the very name of Christianity, and also puft vp with a presumptuous desire to enlarge his Empire, went with a maruellous power both by Sea and Land, vnto this magnificent mansion. The issue wher∣of was such, that after diuers batteries and assaults, the irreligious Infidels broke downe the walles, and entred the Citle, where they made a wonderfull massacre of poore afflicted Christians, without sparing any of the Romane kinde, either male or female. In the mercilesse fury of these infernall Impes, the Emperour <HI>Constantine</HI> was killed, whose head being cut off,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The death of Constantine the Emperour.</HI></NOTE> was carried vpon the poynt of a Launce, through all the Citie and Campe of the Turkes, to the great disgrace and ignominy of Christianitie. His Empresse, Daughters, and other Ladies were put to death after a strange forme of new deuised torments. By this o∣uerthrow of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> this <HI>Mahomet</HI> tooke twelue kingdomes, and two hundred Cities from the Christians, which is a lamentable losse, of such an illustrious Empire. Thus was that Imperiall Citie lost, in the yeare 1453. <HI>May</HI> 29. when it had remained vnder the gouernment of Christians 1198 yeares. It is now the chiefe abode of the great Turke <HI>Sultan Acomet,</HI> the 15 Grand <HI>Can,</HI> of the line of <HI>Ottoman,</HI> liuing at this day, who is about 23 yeares of age; a man more giuen to venery then martiality, which giueth presently a greater aduantage to the Persians in their instant warres.</P>
<P>The forme or situation of this Citie, is like vnto a tri∣angle, the South part whereof, and the East part, are in∣uironed with <HI>Hellespontus,</HI> and <HI>Bosphorus Thraicus;</HI> and the North part adioyning to the firme land. It is in com∣passe about the Walles, estéemed to be 18 miles: in one of these triangled points standeth the Palace of the great Turke, called <HI>Seralia,</HI> and the Forrest wherein he hunteth, which is two miles in length. The speciall obiect of anti∣quity I saw within this Citie, was the incomparable Church of S. <HI>Sophia,</HI> whose ornaments and hallowed ves∣sels were innumerable, in the time of <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Empe∣rour,
<PB N="49" REF="28"/>
who first builded it; but now conuerted to a Mos∣que, and consecrate to <HI>Mahomet</HI> after a Diabolicall man∣ner. I saw also the famous <HI>Hypprodome,</HI> and the Theater whereon the people stood when the Emperours vsed to run their horses, and make their Princely shewes, on so∣lemne dayes, which is now altogether decayed. There is a great Columne in that same place, in the which all those things memorable that haue béene done in this <HI>Hyppo∣drome,</HI> are superficially carued.</P>
<P>Upon the West corner of the Citie, there is a strong Fortresse, fortified with seuen great Towers, and well furnished with munition, called by Turkes, <HI>Iadileke:</HI> In this <HI>Presoun</HI> are Bashaws and Subbashaws imprisoned,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Presoun.</HI></NOTE> and also great men of Christians, if any offence be commit∣ted. Their place of exchange is called <HI>Bezastan,</HI> wherein all sorts of commodities are to bee sold; as Sattins, Silkes, Ueluets, Cloth of Siluer and Gold, and the most exquisit∣ly wrought handkerchiffes, that can be found in the world; with other infinite commodities, the relation of which would be tedious.</P>
<P>I haue séene men and women as vsually sold here in markets, as horses, and other beasts are with vs. The most part of which are <HI>Hungarians, Transiluanians,</HI> and <HI>Bohemi∣ans,</HI> captiues, and of other places besides, which they ouer∣come. Whom, if no compassionable Christian will buy, or or relieue; then must they either turne Turke, or bee addi∣cted to perpetuall slauery. In <HI>Constantinople</HI> there haue happened many fearefull fires, which often haue consumed to ashes the most part of the rarest monuments there, and the beauty of infinite palaces, as <HI>Zonoras</HI> the Constantino∣politan Historiographer in his Histories mentioneth. And now lately in the yeare 1607. October 14. there were burned aboue 3000 houses, of which I saw a number of ruines (as yet) vnrepaired. It is subiect also to diuers earth∣quakes, which haue often subuerted the Towers, Houses, Churches, and walles of the Citie to the ground. Espe∣cially in the yeare 1509. in the reigne of <HI>Baiazeth</HI> the
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
ninth Emperour of the Turkes, in which time more then 13000 persons were all smothered and dead, and laid vp in heapes vnburied. And commonly euery third yeare, the pestilence is excéeding great in that Citie, and after such an odious manner, that those who are infected (before they dy) haue the halfe of their one side rot, and fall away: so that you may easily discerne the whole intrailes of their bodies. It is not licentiated that any Christian should enter in a Tur∣kish Moskée, without the conduct of a Ianisary, the tryall whereof I had when I viewed S. <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perah</HI> is ouer against <HI>Constantinople,</HI> called of old <HI>Cor∣nubizantium;</HI> but by the Turkes <HI>Galata:</HI> It is the place at which Christian ships touch, and where the Embassadours of Christendome lie. From thence I went to the blacke sea: but commonly called, <HI>Mare Euxinum,</HI> where I saw <HI>Pompeis</HI> pillar of marble, standing néere to the shore, vpon a rocky Iland;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lanthorne.</HI></NOTE> and not farre from hence, is a Lanthorne higher then any stéeple, whereon there is a pan full of li∣quor, that burneth euery night, to giue warning vnto ships how néere they come to shore: It is not much vnlike these Lanthornes of <HI>Lighorne</HI> and <HI>Genua.</HI> The water of this sea is neuer a whit blacker then other seas; but it is called black in respect of the dangerous euents in darke and tem∣pestuous nights, which happen there; and because of the rockes and sands which lie a great way from the maine shore; vpon which many vessels are cast away. The blacke sea is not farre from <HI>Galata,</HI> for I both went and returned in one day.</P>
<P>The Turkes haue no bels in their Churches, neither the vse of a clocke, nor numbring of houres; but they haue high round Stéeples, for they contrafact and contradict all the formes of Christians; when they goe to pray, they are cal∣led together by the voyce of crying men, who go vp on the bartizings of their Stéeples, shouting and crying with a shrill voyce: <HI>La illa, Eillala, Mahomet Rezul alla,</HI> that is, <HI>God is a great God, and Mahomet is his Prophet, or other∣wise there is but one God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="29"/>In <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and many other places of <HI>Turky,</HI> I haue séene thrée Sabboth dayes together in one wéeke: the Friday for the <HI>Turkes,</HI> the Saturday for <HI>Iewes,</HI> and the Sunday for the <HI>Christians;</HI> but the Turkes Sabboth is worst kept of all: for they will not spare to doe any labour vpon their holy day. They haue méetings at their publicke prayers euery day fiue seuerall times: the first is, before the rising of the Sunne: the second is, a little before mid∣day: the third is, at three of the clock afternoone: the fourth is at Sun-setting, Summer and Winter: Fifthly, the last houre of praier is alwaies two or thrée houres within night. Many of them will watch till that time, and not sléepe, and others sléeping, will awake at the voyce of the Crier, and go to Church.</P>
<P>In signe of reuerence, and in a superstitious deuotion, before they goe into their Mosquées, they wash themselues in a <HI>Lauatoire,</HI> beginning at the priuy members, next their mouthes, faces, féet and handes: And entring, they incline their heads downeward to the earth; and falling on their knées,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Superstition.</HI></NOTE> doe kisse the ground thrée times. Then the <HI>Talasu∣many,</HI> which is the chiefe Priest, mounteth vpon a high stone, where he maketh many Orations to <HI>Mahomet:</HI> and the rest to assist him, continne a long time shaking their heads, as though they were out of all naturall vnderstan∣ding, repeating oft this word, <HI>Haylamo, Haylamo;</HI> and af∣ter that will sigh grieuously, saying <HI>Houpek.</HI> And some∣times will abruptly sing the <HI>Psalmes</HI> of <HI>Dauid</HI> in the <HI>Ara∣bick</HI> tongue, but to no sense, nor verity of the Scriptures. And at their deuotion, they will not tolerate any women in their company, lest they should withdraw their mindes and affection from their present zeale. The Church-men are called <HI>Hadach Casseis,</HI> or <HI>Daruises,</HI> who weare on their heads gréene Shashes, to make distinction betwéene them and others: for they are accounted to bee of <HI>Mahomets</HI> kindred.</P>
<P>They hold all madde men in great reuerence, as Pro∣phets, or Saints, and if they intend any farre iourney, pri∣uate
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>
purposes; or otherwise, before they goe to battell, they come to craue counsell of these <HI>Santones,</HI> to know if they shall prosper, or not in their attempts. And whatsoe∣uer answere these Bedleem Prophets giue, it is holden to be so credible, as if an Oracle had spoken it. The Turkish Priests are for the most part Moores, whom they account to bee a base people in respect of themselues, calling them <HI>Totseks.</HI> All Turkes doe detest the colour of blacke, and thinke those that weare it, shall neuer enter into Pa∣radice. But the colour of greatest request among them, is greene; wherewith if any Christian shall be apparrelled, hee shall bee sure of Bastinadoes, and other punishments: Neither may hee vse the name of their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his mouth, (vnder the paine of a cruell censure to bee inflicted vpon him) whom they so much adore and ho∣nour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The birth of Mahomet.</HI></NOTE>This <HI>Mahomet</HI> was borne <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 591. in <HI>Itraripia,</HI> a beggarly village in <HI>Arabia,</HI> whose father was <HI>Abdallas,</HI> an Ismalite; and his mother <HI>Cadiges</HI> a Iew; both different in religion, and also of diuers Countries. In his youth hée was partly taught the <HI>Iudaicall</HI> law, and partly the super∣stition of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Many alleage his parentage was neuer knowne (being so base) vntill his riper yeares be∣wrayed the same. I also learned, that his parents dyed whiles he was a yong childe, and was turned ouer to his vncle, who after sold him to one <HI>Abdominoples,</HI> a Mer∣chant in <HI>Palestina:</HI> And he, after a little time, hauing re∣marked his ready and prompt wit, sent him downe to <HI>Ae∣gypt,</HI> to be a Factor in his merchandise; where, by his dis∣simulate behauiour hee crept in fauour with Christians, Iewes, and Gentiles. Hee was in proportion of a meane stature, liuely faced, big-headed, eloquent in language, of a sanguinicall complexion, and a couragious stomacke, in all attempts excéeding desperate: he was also deceitfull, vari∣ant, and fraudulent, as may appeare in his Satanicall Fa∣bles, expressed in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> where oft one saying contra∣dicteth another, both in words and effect.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="30"/>About this time there was one <HI>Sergius,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Monke, banished from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> because he allowed of the <HI>Arrian</HI> sect: who afterward came to <HI>Palestina,</HI> and frequenting the house of <HI>Abdeminoples,</HI> fell in acquain∣tance with the yong man <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and this Frier percei∣uing the aspiring quicknesse of his braine, bare a great aff ection to his naturall perfections. Shortly after this, his Maister dying, without heires, and his Mistresse en∣ioying many rich possessions: she, for these his extraordi∣nary qualities, from the degrée of a seruant, aduanced him to bee her owne husband. That vnhappy match was no sooner done, but shee repented it with teares; for he being subiect to the falling sicknesse, would often fall flat on the ground, before her, staring, gaping, and foming at the mouth, so that his company became loathsome and detesta∣ble: The which begun contempt in his bed-fellow, being to him manifested, he stroue (vnder the shadow of inuen∣ted lies) to mitigate the fury of her hatefull disdaine, fai∣ning and attesting, that when he fell to the ground, it was the great God spoke with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The dissimu∣lation of the false Prophet Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> before whose faith (saith he) I am not able to stand; such is his soliciting of me, with words of terrour and Maiestie, to reforme the waies of the degenerate people with fire and sword, sith <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> (notwithstanding of their Miracles) haue béene re∣iected by the world.

<P>This new coyned doctrine, was no sooner wrapt vp in his execrable Alcoran, but he began to spit forth his abho∣minable and blasphemous heresies: Affirming, that Christ was not the Son of the most High, nor that Messias loo∣ked for; denying also the Trinity, with many other pro∣phane blasphemies. The worke concluded, for the better aduancement of his purpose, he married the daughter of the chiefe Prince of his owne Tribe: By which new affi∣nity, he not onely seduced his Father-in-law, but also the whole linage of that family; by whose acceptance and con∣uersion, he also confederated with other associates, and waxed daily stronger. Contending continually to diuul∣gate his name, ay more and more, hee assembled his new <HI>Alcoranists,</HI> exhorting them to assist him in the besieging of <HI>Mecha,</HI> which Citizens had in dirision rebuked his Law, and absolutely disdained his <HI>Mahometicall</HI> illusions: and promised to them, in such a well-deseruing attempt, both etenall felicity, and the spoyles of his contradictors; per∣swasiuely assuring them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Illusions of Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> that God would deliuer all the gaine-sayers of his <HI>Alcoran</HI> into his hands. By the which allurements they being moued, rose to the number of three thousand in Armes, and menaced <HI>Mecha,</HI> but the Citizens put him to flight, and so was he thrise serued; till in the end hee wonne their Citie: wherein, after his death, he was entoombed in an Iron Coffin: Which betweene two Adamants hangeth to this day (as I haue béene informed of sundry Turkes who saw it) which confirmed in them a solid beliefe of his erronious do∣ctrine.</P>
<P>I haue seene sometimes two thousand Turkes trauel∣ling
<PB N="55" REF="31"/>
to <HI>Mecha,</HI> in pilgrimage; which is in <HI>Arabia Felix;</HI> where many in a superstitious deuotion, hauing séene the Toombe of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> are neuer desirous to sée the vanities of the world againe: for in a franticke piety they cause a Smith to pull forth their eyes: And these men are called af∣terward <HI>Hoggeis,</HI> that is, Holy men▪ whom the Turkes much honour and regard.</P>
<P>Some write, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his youth, was a Soul∣dier, vnder the conduct of <HI>Heraclius;</HI> and some mutinies happening in the Army, he, with certaine <HI>Arabians,</HI> his Country-men, by faction, separated themselues: whereup∣on, <HI>Mahomet,</HI> encouraging them in their defection, was chosen their Captaine; and so for a certaine time they con∣tinued rebellious Runagates, Theeues, and Robbers of all people.</P>
<P>The subtilty of this dissembler was admirable; who knowing that he was distitute of heauenly gifts, to worke miracles, feigned that God sent him with the Sword. He also promised, at the end of a thousand yeares to returne, and bring them to Paradise; but hee hath falsified his pro∣mise, for the time is expired twenty three yeares ago. And they imagining, that hee is either diseased, or become lame in his iourney, haue ascribed to him another thousand yeares to come. But long may their wicked and faithlesse generation gape, before he come, till such time, that in a ge∣nerall conuocation, they be partakers of his endlesse dam∣nation in hell; vnlesse it please the Lord in his mercy, to con∣uert them, before that time.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet,</HI> chiefly prohibiteth in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the eating of Swines flesh, and drinking of wine, which indeed the best sort do, but their baser kind are daily drunkards: Their common drinke is <HI>Sherpet,</HI> composed of water, ho∣ny, and sugar, which is exceeding delectable in the tast: And the vsuall courtesie they bestow on their friends, who visite them, is a Cup of <HI>Coffa,</HI> made of a kind of seede called <HI>Coaua,</HI> and of a blackish colour, which they drinke so hote as possible they can, and is good to ex∣pell
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>
the crudity of raw meates, and hearbes, so much by them frequented. And those that cannot attaine to this liquor, must bee contented with the cooling streames of water.</P>
<P>It is incident to Turkes, which haue not that generosi∣tie of minde, to temper felicitie, to bee glutted with the superfluous fruits of doubtfull prosperity: Neither haue they a patient resolution to withstand aduersity, nor hope to expect the better alteration of time. But by an infused malice in their wicked spirits, when they are any way cala∣mited, will with importunate compulsion, cause the poore slauish subiected Christians, surrender all they haue, the halfe, or so forth, sometimes with strokes, menacings, and sometimes death it selfe; which plainely doth demonstrate their excessiue cruelty, and the poore Christians ineuitable misery.</P>
<P>I haue often heard Turkes brawle one with another, most vilely, but I neuer saw, or heard, that they either in priuate or publique quarrels, durst strike one another; nei∣ther dare they, for feare of seuere punishment imposed to such quarrellers: But they will iniure and strike Christi∣ans, who dare not say it is amisse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cruelty of Turkes toward their seruants. They also pu∣nish malefa∣ctors three manner of wayes, accor∣ding to the hainousnesse of the offence most seuerely, which I haue heere omitted to relate.</HI></NOTE> nor strike againe. It is a common thing with them, to kill their seruants for a very small offence, and when they haue done throw them like dogs in a ditch. And oftentimes (if not so) will lay them downe on their backes, hoysing vp their heeles, bind their feete together, and fasten them to a post, and with a cudgell giue them thrée or foure hundred blowes on the soales of their féete; whereupon, peraduenture, some euer go lame after.</P>
<P>Their seruants are bought, and sold, like bruite beasts in markets; neither can these miserable drudges euer reco∣uer liberty, except they buy themselues free, either by one meane or other.</P>
<P>Their wiues are not farre from the like seruitude, for the men by the Alcoran are admitted to marry as many women as they will, or their ability can keep. And if it shal
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>
happen, that any one of these women (I meane either wife or concubine) prostituteth her selfe to another besides her husband; then may he by authority, bind her hands and feet, hang a stone about her neeke, and cast her into a riuer, which by them is vsually done in the night.</P>
<P>But when those Infidels please to abuse poore Christi∣an women against their husbands will, they little regard the transgression of the Christian Law, who as well de∣floure their daughters as their wiues, yet the deuoute Ma∣hometans neuer meddle with them, accompting them∣selues damned to copulate (as they think) with the off∣spring of dogs: The Turkes generally, when they commit any copulation with Christians, or their owne Sex, they wash themselus in a South-running fountaine, before the Sun-rising, thinking thereby to wash away their sins.</P>
<P>But now to returne to the Turkes:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The marriage of Turkes.</HI></NOTE> Their custome and manner of mariage is this: If a man affecteth a yong maid, he buyeth her of her parents, and giueth a good summe of mony for her, and after she is bought, he enrolles her name in the <HI>Cadies</HI> booke, witnessing she is his bound wife, bought of her father. Loe this is all the forme of their Marriage: This being done the father of the woman sen∣deth houshold-stuffe home with the Bride, which is carry∣ed through the streets on Mulets or Camels backes, the two new married folkes marching before, are conueyed with Musicke, their owne acquaintance and friends, vnto his house.</P>
<P>The Turkes in generall, whensoeuer they loath or di∣slike their wiues, vse to sell them in Markets, or otherwise bestow them, on their men-slaues: And although their affe∣ction were neuer so great toward them, yet they neuer eate together, for commonly the women stand, and serue their husbands at meate, and after that they eat apart by them∣selues, secretly, without admission of any mankinde in their company, if they be aboue foureteene yeares of age, They go seldome abroad, vnlesse it be each Thurseday at night, when they go to the Graues to mourne for the dead,
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>
alwaies couering their faces, very modestly with white or black maskes, which are neuer vncouered, till they returne to their houses.</P>
<P>Many other ceremonies they haue, which would be too prolixe for me to recite. And notwithstanding of all this exernall grauity, amongst these hirelings, yet there are in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> aboue 40000 brothel-houses, <HI>Turqueski,</HI> ts <HI>Libertines</HI>; in any of which, if a Christian, (especially <HI>Franckes</HI>) be apprehended, he must either turne Turke, or laue, all his life: But the women by a policy apply a coun∣terpoyson to this seuerity, for they accustomably come to the Chambers of their Benefactors and Well-willers, or other places appointed secretly, where so they learne either a <HI>French Syncopa,</HI> or an <HI>Italian Bergemasko.</HI></P>
<P>The Lent of the Turks is called <HI>Byrham,</HI> which conti∣nueth the space of a month once in the yeare: in all which time, from the Sunne rising to his setting, they neither eate nor drinke: And at their prayers (especially in this fasting) they vse often to reiterate these words, <HI>Hue, hue, hue,</HI> that is; <HI>He he he, alone is God;</HI> or <HI>There is but one onely supreme Power</HI>; which they do in deriston of Christi∣ans, who (as they say) adore three Gods. They haue also this sinister opinion, that at the day of iudgement, when <HI>Mahomet</HI> shall appeare, there shall be three displayed Ban∣ners, vnder the which all good people shall be conducted in Paradise. The one of <HI>MOSES,</HI> vnder the which the children of <HI>Israel</HI> shall be: The second of <HI>IESVS,</HI> vnder which <HI>Christians</HI> shall bee: The third of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> vn∣der the which shall be the <HI>Arabs, Turkes, Moores,</HI> and <HI>Musilmans:</HI> All which, they thinke, shall be eleuated to seuerall honours; And they in promotion shall bee discer∣ned from the rest, by chambers made of replendant light, which God will giue them; wherein they shall haue ban∣quetings, feastings, dancing, and the best melody can bee deuised.</P>
<P>They hold also this, as a confident Article of their Be∣leefe, that there are seuen Paradises in heauen, the paue∣ments
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>
whereof are laid with gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seuen Paradi∣ses.</HI></NOTE> siluer, pearles, pretious stones, and garnished with stately buildings, and pleasant gardens, wherein are all sorts of fruit, and Princely Pa∣laces; through the which run riuers of milke, hony, and wine. The first Paradice, they call it <HI>Genete Alcholde,</HI> the second <HI>Alfirduzy,</HI> the third <HI>Anthinak,</HI> the fourth <HI>Re∣duasch,</HI> the fift <HI>Azelem,</HI> the sixt <HI>Alcodush,</HI> that is, holy; and the seuenth <HI>Almega,</HI> that is, the greatest. And that in the midst of this last Paradise, there is a stately tree called <HI>Tu∣bah,</HI> the leafe of which, is partly of gold, and partly of sil∣uer; whose boughes extend round about the walles of this seuenth Paradise, whereon the name of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is writ∣ten, neere to the name of God, in these words, <HI>Alla, illa, he, allah, Mahomet Rezul allah.</HI> The which words are in such reuerence amongst the Turks, that a Christian should hap∣pen, vnaduisedly to repeate them, hee is adiudged to a most cruell death, or compulsed to renounce his Christian Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>As concerning their opinion of Hell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The opinion Turkes haue of Hell.</HI></NOTE> they hold it to be deepe Gulfe, betwixt two Mountaines: from the mouth whereof are Dragons, that continually throw fire, being large eight leagues, and hath a darke entry, where the hor∣rible fiends meete the perplexed sinners, conuoying them till they come to a Bridge that is so narrow as the edge of a rasour: whereupon those who haue not committed hai∣nous offences, may passe ouer to hell, but those who haue done buggery (as the most part of them do) and homicide, shall fall headlong from it, to the profoundest pit in Hell, where they shall sometimes burne in fire, and sometimes be cast into hote boyling water to be refreshed. And for the greater punishment of the wicked (say they) God hath planted a trie in Hell, named <HI>Saiaratash</HI> or <HI>Roozo Sayta∣nah,</HI> that is, the head of the Deuill, vpon the fruit of which, the damned continually feed: <HI>Mahomet</HI> in one of the chapters of his Alcoran calleth this trie, <HI>The trie of Malediction.</HI></P>
<P>They also thinke the tormented soules may one day
<PB N="60" REF="34"/>
bee saued, prouiding they doe indure the scorching flames of Hell patiently. Thus, as briefly as I could, haue I laid open the opinion of the Turkes, concerning their Hell and Heauen, before the eyes of these, who peraduen∣ture haue neuer beene acquainted with such a Ghostly Dis∣course.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The begin∣ning of the Turkes.</HI></NOTE>The originall of the Turkes, is said to haue béene in <HI>Scythia,</HI> from whence they came to <HI>Arabia Petrea,</HI> and giuing battell oft to the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> in the end subdued them, and so they multiplyed, and mightily increased: the ap∣parence of their further increasing, is very euident ex∣cept God of his mercy towards vs preuent their bloud-sucking threatnings, with the vengeance of his iust iudge∣ments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sarazens</HI> are descended of <HI>Esau,</HI> who after he had lost the blessing, went and inhabited in <HI>Arabia Petrea</HI>; and his posterity, striuing to make a cléere distinction be∣tweene them, the <HI>Ismalites,</HI> and <HI>Iewes,</HI> called themselues (as come of <HI>Sara</HI>) <HI>Sarazens</HI>; and not of <HI>Hagar,</HI> the hand∣maid of <HI>Abraham,</HI> of whom came the <HI>Ismaelites,</HI> neither of the race of <HI>Iacob,</HI> of whom came the <HI>Iewes.</HI> But now the <HI>Sarazens</HI> being ioyned with the <HI>Turkes,</HI> their Conque∣rours, haue both lost their name, and the right of their descent.</P>
<P>The puissance of the great <HI>Turke</HI> is admirable, yet the most part of his Kingdomes in <HI>Asia,</HI> are not well inhabi∣ted, neither populous, but these parts which border with Christians, are strongly fortified with Castles, People, and Munition: If Christian Princes could concord, and con∣sult together, it were a easie thing in one yeare, to subdue the <HI>Turkes,</HI> and roote out their very names from the earth; yea, moreouer, I am certified, that there are more Christi∣ans, euen slaues and subiects to the great <HI>Turke,</HI> which doe inhabite his Dominions, then might ouerthrow and con∣quer these Infidels, if they had worthy Captaines, Gouer∣nours, and furniture of Armes; without the helpe of any Christian of Christendome.</P>

The inhumane policy of the Turkes to auoyd ciuill dissen∣tion, is such, that the seed of <HI>Ottoman</HI> (al except one of them) are strangled to death: wherefore as <HI>Augustus Cesar</HI> said of <HI>Herod</HI> in the like case, It is better to bee the great Turkes dogge, then his sonne.

Ouer-against this Citie is the Ile of <HI>Lango,</HI> anciently called <HI>Co∣os,</HI> wherein the great <HI>Hippocrates</HI> was borne, and <HI>Apelles</HI> the most excellent Painter. It is both fertile and popu∣lous, and of circuit about foure score miles.

Oh great pitty! that the vsurpers of Gods word, and the worlds great enemy, should maintaine (without feare) that famous kingdome, being but 1500 Turkes in all, who are the keepers of it: vnspeakeable is the calamity of that poore afflicted Christian people, vnder the terrour of these Infi∣dels: who would, if they had Armes or assistance of any Christian Potentate, easily subuert and abolish the Turks without any disturbance; yea and would render the whole Signiory thereof to such a noble Actor.

In which worke he should reape (que∣stionlesse) not onely an infinite treasure of worldly com∣modities, that followeth vpon so great a Conquest, but al∣so a heauenly and eternall reward of immortall glory.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An enterprise of the Floren∣tines.</HI></NOTE> The which deliuerance the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> thought to haue accomplished (hauing purchased the good will of the Ilan∣ders) with fiue Gallounes, and fiue thousand Souldiers: who being mindfull to take first in the Fortresse of <HI>Fa∣magosta,</HI> directed so their course, that in the night they should haue entred the Hauen, dis-barke their men, and scale the walles. But in this plot they were farre disap∣pointed by an vnhappy Pilot of the Uice-Admirall; who mistaking the Port went into a wrong Bay: which the <HI>Florentines</HI> considering, resolued to returne and kéepe the sea till the second night; but by a dead calme they were fru∣strated of their aimes, and on the morrow discouered by the Castle: whereupon the Turkes went presently to Armes, and charged the Inhabitants to come defend that place: But about foure hundred <HI>Greekes</HI> in the West part at <HI>Paphos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>About</HI> 400 <HI>Greekes were slughtered by the Turkes in the yeare</HI> 1607</NOTE> rebelled; thinking that time had altered their hard fortunes, by a new change: but were they preuented, and euery one cut off, by the bloudy hands of the Turkes.

<P>In my returne from <HI>Nicosia</HI> to <HI>Famagosta,</HI> with my Trouchman, we encountred by the way with foure <HI>Turkes,</HI> who néedes would haue my horse to ride vpon; which my Interpreter refused: But they in a reuenge pulled me by the héeles from the horse backe, beating me most pittifully, and left me almost for dead. In this meane while my com∣panion fled, and escaped the sceleratenesse of their hands; and if it had not beene for some compassionable <HI>Greekes,</HI> who by accident came by, and relieued me, I had (doubt∣lesse) immediatly perished. From <HI>Famagosta</HI> I imbarked in a <HI>Germe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tripoly.</HI></NOTE> and arriued at <HI>Tripoly. Tripoly</HI> is a Citie in <HI>Siria,</HI> standing a mile from the marine side, néere to the foote of Mount <HI>Libanus:</HI> since it hath béene first founded, it hath thrée times béene situated and remoued in thrée sun∣dry places: First, it was ouerwhelmed with water. Se∣condly, it was sacked with <HI>Cursares,</HI> and Pirates. Third∣ly, it is now like to be ouerthrowne with new made moun∣taines of sand. There is no Hauen by many miles neere vnto it, but a dangerous rode, where often when Nor∣therly winds blow, ships are cast away. The great trafficke which now is at this place, was formerly at <HI>Scanderona,</HI> a little more Eastward; but by reason of the infectious aire, that corrupteth the bloud of strangers, procéeding of two high mountaines, who are supposed to bee part of mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> which with-hold the prospect of the Sunne from the In-dwellers, more then thrée houres in the morning. So that in my knowledge, I haue knowne dye in one ship, and a moneths time, twenty Mariners: for this cause the Christian Shippes were glad to haue their commodities

brought to <HI>Tripoly,</HI> which is a more wholsome and conue∣nient place.</P>
<P>The daily interrogation I had here for a Carauans de∣parture to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> was not to me a little fastidious, being mindfull to visite <HI>Babylon.</HI> In this my expectation I tooke purpose with thrée <HI>Venetian</HI> Marchants, to go sée the Ce∣dars of <HI>Libanon,</HI> which was but a dayes iourney thither. As we ascended vpon the mountaine, our ignorant guide mistaking the way, brought vs in a labyrinth of dangers; insomuch that wrestling amongst intricate paths of rocks, two of our Asses fell ouer a banke and brake their neckes: And if it had not beene for a Christian <HI>Amaronite,</HI> who ac∣cidentally encountred with vs, in our wilsum wandring, we had béen miserably lost, both in regard of rockes, and heapes of snow we passed, and also of great torrents which fell downe with force from the steepy toppes, wherein one of these Marchants was twice almost drowned. When we arriued to the place where the Cedars grew, we saw but 24 of all, growing after the manner of Oke trées, but a great deale taller, straighter, and greater, and the branches grow so straight out, as though they were kept by Art.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cedars.</HI></NOTE>Although that in the dayes of <HI>Salomon</HI> this mountaine was ouer-clad with forrests of Cedars, yet now there are but onely these, and 9 miles Westward thence 17 more. The nature of that tree is alwaies gréene, yéelding an odo∣riferous smell, and an excellent kind of fruit, like vnto Ap∣ples, but of a swéeter taste, &amp; more wholesome in digestion. The roots of some of these Cedars are almost destroyed by shepheards, who haue made fires thereat, and holes wherein they sléepe; yet neuerthelesse they flourish gréene aboue in the toppes, and branches. The length of this mountaine is about fortie miles, reaching from the West to the East; and continually, Summer and Winter reserueth snow on the toppes. It is also beautified with all the orna∣ments of nature, as herbage, tillage, pastorage, fructife∣rous trées, fine fountaines, good Cornes, and absolutely the

best wine that is bred on the earth. The Signior thereof is a free-holder, by birth a Turk, and will not acknowledge any superior, but the most part of the inhabited Uillages are <HI>Christians,</HI> called <HI>Amaronites,</HI> or <HI>Nostranes, quasi Na∣zaritans,</HI> and are gouerned by their owne Patriarke. There are none at this day, do speake the <HI>Syriack</HI> tongue, saue onely these people of Mount <HI>Libanus</HI>; &amp; in that Lan∣guage the <HI>Alcoran</HI> of <HI>Mahomet</HI> is written. The kind <HI>Ama∣ronite</HI> whom we met, and tooke with vs for our best guide, in descending from the Cedars, shewed vs many caues and holes in rockes, where <HI>Coliers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coliers religi∣ous Greekes.</HI></NOTE> religious <HI>Sirens</HI> and <HI>Amaronites</HI> abide: Amongst these austere Cottages, I saw a faire Toombe all of one stone, being seuentéene foote of length, which (as he said) was the sepulchre of the valiant <HI>Ioshua,</HI> who conducted the people of <HI>Israel</HI> in the land of promise.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mahometans</HI> esteeme this to bee a holy place, and many resort to it in pilgrimage, to offer vp their Satani∣call prayers to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> I saw vpon this Mountaine a sort of fruit, called <HI>Amazza franchi</HI>: that is, <HI>the death of Christians</HI>; because when <HI>Italians,</HI> or others of <HI>Europe,</HI> eate any quantity thereof, they presently fall into the bloudy fluxes, or else ingender some other pestilentious feuer, whereof they die. The Patriarke did most kindly enter∣taine vs at his house; so did also all the <HI>Amaronites</HI> of the other Uillages, who met vs in our way before we came to their Townes, and brought presents with them of Bread, Wine, Figges, Oliues, Sallats, Capons, Egges, and such like, as they could on a suddaine prouide. About the Uillage of <HI>Eden,</HI> is the most fruitfull part of all <HI>Libanus,</HI> abounding in all sorts of delitious fruites. True it is, the variety of these things, maketh the silly people thinke, the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> was there: By which allegeance, they approue the apprehension of such a sinistrous opinion, with these arguments; that Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> is sequestrate from the circum-iacent Regions, and is inuincible for the height, and strengths they haue in rockes; &amp; that <HI>Eden</HI> was
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>
still re-edified by the fugitiue inhabitants, when their ene∣mies had ransacked it: Also they affirme, before the deluge it was so nominate, and after the floud it was repaired againe by <HI>Iaphet,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Noah,</HI> who builded <HI>Ioppa,</HI> or <HI>Iaphta,</HI> in <HI>Palestina.</HI> Loe these are the reasons they show strangers for such like informations.</P>
<P>There are with this one, other two supposed places of this earthly Paradise: the one is by the Turkes, and some ignorant <HI>Georgians,</HI> holden to bee at <HI>Damascus,</HI> for the beauty of faire fields, gardens, and excellent fruites there, especially for the trée called <HI>Mouslee,</HI> which they beléeue hath growne there since the beginning of the world. In∣déed it is a rare and singular Tree, for I saw it at <HI>Damascus,</HI> and others also of the same kind, vpon <HI>Nylus</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI>: The growth whereof is strauge; for euery yeare in September it is cut downe hard by the roote, and in fiue moneths the Tree buddeth vp a pace againe, brin∣ging forth leaues,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Tree hath seuerall vertues bea∣ring but one Apple at once.</HI></NOTE> floures, and fruit. The leafe thereof is of such a bredth, that thrée men may easily stand vn∣der the shadow of it, and the Apple is bigger then a foote∣ball.</P>
<P>The third place by the <HI>Chelfaines,</HI> is thought to be in the East part of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> neere to the ioyning of <HI>Tygris,</HI> and <HI>Euphrates</HI>; where, so they inhabite. I haue oft requi∣red of these <HI>Chelfaines,</HI> what reason they had for this con∣ceiued opinion: who answered me they receiued it from time to time, by the Tradition of their Ancestors; And be∣cause of the riuer <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and others riuers mentioned in the Scriptures, which to this day, detaine their names in that Country. Some hold that Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> exten∣ded ouer all the earth. But contrarywise it manifestly ap∣peareth by the second chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> verse twenty, that this Garden which wee call Paradise, wherein <HI>Adam</HI> was put to dresse it, was a certaine place on earth, containing a particular portion of a Country, called <HI>Eden,</HI> which boundeth on the riuer <HI>Euphrates.</HI> To this, and all the rest, I answere, no certainety can bee had of the place where
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>
<HI>Eden</HI> was, either by reading or trauelling, because this ri∣uer hath beene oft diuided in sundry streames: And it is said, that <HI>Cyrus,</HI> when hee wonne <HI>Babylon,</HI> did turne the maine channell of <HI>Euphrates</HI> to another course. But how∣soeuer, or wheresoeuer it be, I resolue my selfe, no man can demonstrate the place, which God for the sinnes and fall of man, did not onely accurse, but also the whole face of the earth.</P>
<P>Many ancient Authors haue agreed with the opinion of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Aristotle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Diuisions.</HI></NOTE> constantly affirming, that Moun∣taines, Ilands, and Countries, haue receiued great altera∣tion by the inundation of riuers, and violence of raging seas. <HI>Thracia,</HI> hath béene diuided from <HI>Bithinia: Nigropon∣ti,</HI> from <HI>Thessalia: Corfu</HI> from <HI>Epire: Sicilia,</HI> from <HI>Italy:</HI> The Iles <HI>Orcades,</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and many other Ilands, and Countries, cut through so in diuisions after the same forme. Wherefore the more a man contemplates to search the knowledge of <HI>Eden,</HI> and such high mysteries (apper∣taining onely to the Creator) the more he shall faile in his purpose, offend God, and bee esteemed fantasticall for his paines.</P>
<P>But to be briefe, after my returne to <HI>Tripoly,</HI> I departed thence Eastward, with a Carauan of <HI>Turkes</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> be∣ing ten daies iourney distant. In all this way (leauing <HI>Scanderon</HI> and <HI>Antiochia</HI> on our left hand) I saw nothing worthy remarking, saue onely a few scattered Uillages, and poore miserable people, liuing in Tents, and following their Flockes, to whom I payed sundry <HI>Caffars:</HI> who re∣moue their women, children, and cattell, where so they find Fountaines, and good pastorage: like vnto the custome of the ancient <HI>Israelites:</HI> which in their vagabonding fashi∣on, did plainly demonstrate the necessity they had to liue, rather then any pleasure they had in their liuing. The re∣citation of their ridiculous ceremonies, and deuillish reli∣gion by them vsed, to auoid tediousnesse I omit.</P>
<P>Before my arriuall in <HI>Aleppo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aleppo.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Carauan</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> was from thence departed, which bred no small griefe in

my breast: the <HI>Venetian</HI> Consull, to whom I was highly recommended, by the aforesaid Merchants (hauing had some insight of my intended voyage) informed me that the <HI>Carauan</HI> stayed at <HI>Beershak</HI> on <HI>Euphrates,</HI> for some concei∣ued report they had of <HI>Arabs,</HI> that lay for them in the De∣sarts, and willed me to hire a <HI>Ianisary,</HI> and three souldiers, to ouer-hie them; whose counsell I receiued: but was méere∣ly frustrated of my designes. True it was, they stayed, but were gone three daies before my comming to that vnhap∣py place. These my periured consorts perceiuing there was no ability to follow the Carauan any further, infor∣med me, another company would arriue there shortly. But to what end did they this; Onely, that by long attendance, they might sucke the money from my purse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The abuses of Infidels.</HI></NOTE> which indeed was extraordinary chargeable. The abuses of these dam∣nable Hel-hounds my Protectors, the dangers I sustained in that barbarous Uillage, and in my constrained returne to <HI>Aleppo:</HI> to expresse I will not; but rather sepulchrize it in the pit of obliuion, least the remembrance of former miseries, shold be a renuing of fresh sorrowes: knowing that I indured more trouble in that lost time, then in all my succeeding trauailes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A new inten∣ded voyage.</HI></NOTE>To bee a recompence to this my former losse, I deter∣mined (God willing) not onely to visite <HI>Babylon,</HI> which I so neerely lost, but also all the most famous kingdomes that border with the <HI>Indian, Persian,</HI> and <HI>Caspian</HI> seas. This <HI>Beershak</HI> is in <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> and thought to haue beene <HI>Padan-Aram,</HI> where <HI>Laban</HI> dwelt: It standeth néere to the ioyning of <HI>Tygris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Niniuy.</HI></NOTE> and swift running <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and not far hence is the demolished Citie of <HI>Niniuy</HI> on <HI>Ty∣gris,</HI> whose very ruines are now come to ruine; the de∣caies whereof, is semblable to that sacked <HI>Lacedemon</HI> in <HI>Sparta.</HI></P>

is a Citie in <HI>Siria</HI>; the name of which hath béene so oft changed by <HI>Turkes,</HI> that the true Antiquity of it can hard∣ly be knowne: It is both large and populous, and furnish∣ed with all sorts of Marchandize, especially of <HI>Indigo</HI> and spices, that is brought ouer land from <HI>Go,</HI> and other pla∣ces in <HI>India,</HI> which draweth a concurrance of all Nations to it.</P>
<P>In my expectation heere (being disappointed of my desi∣red aimes) I pretended to visite <HI>Ierusalem</HI> in my backe∣comming; and for the furtherance of my determination, I ioyned with a <HI>Carauan</HI> of <HI>Armenians,</HI> and <HI>Turkes,</HI> that were well guarded with <HI>Ianisaries,</HI> and Souldiers; of whom some were to stay at <HI>Damascus</HI> by the way, and some mindfull to the furthest marke. And for my better safe∣guard (being alwaies alone, which by all was euer much ad∣mired) the Uize Consull tooke surety of the Captaine, that hee should protect mee safely from théeues, cut-throates, and the exactions of tributes by the way, deliuering mee fréely into the hands of the <HI>Padre Guardiano</HI> at <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> which being done, I hired two Mulets from a <HI>Turk</HI>▪ one to ride vpon, and another to carry my victuals; and so set for∣ward with them. The number of our company were about 900 <HI>Armenians, Christian</HI> pilgrimes, men and women, 600 <HI>Turkes,</HI> trafficking for their owne businesse, and 100 Souldiers, thrée <HI>Schowsses,</HI> and sixe <HI>Ianisaries</HI> to keep them from inuasions.</P>
<P>Betweene <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Damascus,</HI> wee had nine daies iourney, in fiue of which, we had pleasant trauelling, and good <HI>Canes</HI> to lodge in, that had béene builded for the sup∣port of Trauellors, and are well maintained: But when we passed <HI>Hamsek,</HI> which is a little more then mid-way, wee had dangerous trauelling, being oft assailed with <HI>Arabs,</HI> fatigated with rocky Mountaines, and sometimes in point of choaking for lacke of water. The confusion of this multitude was not onely grieuous in regard of the ex∣treme heate, prouiding of victuals at poore Uillages, and scarcity of water to fill our bottles, made of boare skinnes,
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
but also amongst narrow and stony passages, thronging, we oft fell one ouer another, in great heapes, in danger to be smothered: yea, and oftentimes, we that were Christi∣ans, had our bodies well beaten, by our conducting <HI>Turkes.</HI> At our accustomed dismounting, to recreate our selues, and refresh the beasts, I would often fetch a walke, to stretch my legs, that were stifled with a scumbling beast; where∣with the <HI>Turkes</HI> were mightily discontented,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The reposing of the Turkes.</HI></NOTE> and in derisi∣on would laugh, and mucke me: For they cannot abide a man to walke in turnes, or stand to eate; their vsage being such, that when they come from the Horse backe, pre∣sently sit downe on the ground, folding their feete vnder them, when they repose, dine, and sup. So do also their Ar∣tizans, and all <HI>Turkes</HI> in the world sit alwaies crosse-legged, wrongfully abusing the commendable consuetudo of the industrious Taylors. In their houses they haue no bed to lie on, nor chaires to sit on, nor Tables to eate on, but a bench made of Boords, along the house side, of a foote height from the floore, spread ouer with a Carpet, whereon they vsually sit, eating, drinking, slée∣ping, resting, and doing of manuall exercises, all in one place.</P>
<P>They neuer vncloth themselues, when they go to rest, neither haue they any bed-cloathes, saue onely a couerlet aboue them: I haue seene hundreds of them, after this manner, lie ranked like durty swine, in a beastly stie; or loathsome Iades, in a filthy stable. Upon the ninth day (leauing <HI>Cotafa</HI> behind vs on the Mountaines) wee entred in a pleasant plaine of thrée leagues in length, adorned with many Uillages, Gardens, and Riuers; and arriuing at <HI>Da∣mascus,</HI> we were all lodged (some in Chambers wanting beds, and others without, on hard stones) in a great <HI>Cane</HI> called <HI>Heramnen,</HI> where we stayed one day.</P>

<P><PB N="78" REF="43"/>But such is the couetous nature of Man, that with his couenant he cannot be contented, vnlesse he séeke otherwise by all vnlawfull meanes to purchase himselfe an vniust gaine: but the high respect I had of his other perfections, made mee ouer-sée and winke at that imperfection of aua∣ritiousnesse in him; and especially remembring my selfe to be vnder his protection, I alwayes indeuoured my selfe so, that in his sight, I wonne extraordinary fauour: inso∣much that in danger, or security, he would euer haue mee néere by him, which I also craued, and stroue to obserue the poynts of his will, and my owne safety.

<P>But to procéed in my Pilgrimage, on the aforesaid third day, in the after-noone, wee entred into <HI>Galile,</HI> passing a∣long a faire bridge that is ouer the riuer <HI>Iordan,</HI> which di∣uideth <HI>Syria</HI> from <HI>Galile.</HI> This bridge by the <HI>Armenians,</HI> is called <HI>Iacobs</HI> bridge; and not farre hence, they shewed me the place where <HI>Iacob</HI> wrestled with the Angell, and where <HI>Esau</HI> met his brother <HI>Iacob</HI> to haue killed him. <HI>Iordan</HI> is scarcely knowne by the name in this place: but after∣ward I saw his greater growth, ending in <HI>Sodome,</HI> where∣of in the owne place I shall more amply discourse.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Description of the Holy Land.</HI></NOTE>Aprill the seuenth day, according to the computation of the Roman Kalender, and by ours March the 28, I en∣tred in <HI>Galile,</HI> a Prouince of <HI>Canaan,</HI> that sometimes flowed with Milke and Honey. It is commonly cal∣led <HI>Terra sancta,</HI> but by the Scriptures, the <HI>Land of Pro∣mise. Canaan</HI> is diuided into fiue Prouinces, <HI>viz.

<PB N="79" REF="43"/>
<HI>Aegypt</HI> vnder that name. By later Writers the Holy-Land hath also béene tearmed <HI>Palestina.</HI> But howsoeuer they differ in descriptions, it is most certaine, that at this day it is onely and vsually diuided into these fiue particular Prouinces. <HI>Galile</HI> and <HI>Palestina</HI> for the present are the most fertile and largest Prouinces thereof.</P>
<P>After we had trauelled a great way along the lake of <HI>Ge∣nesareth,</HI> which is of length 8 leagues, and large 4. where I saw the decaied Townes of <HI>Bethsaida,</HI> and <HI>Tiberias,</HI> lying on the North side of the same Sea, we left the Marine, and came to <HI>Cana,</HI> to stay all night; in which we had no Caues to saue vs from the <HI>Arabs,</HI> nor couerture aboue our heads, but the hard ground to lie on, which was alwayes my bed, in the most part of <HI>Asia:</HI> In the night when wee slept, the Souldiers kept centenall, and in the day when we reposed, they slept, and we watched. This <HI>Cana</HI> was the Towne wherein our Sauiour wrought the first Miracle, conuer∣ting, at the Marriage, Water into Wine. The day follo∣wing, embracing our way, we passed ouer a little pleasant mountaine, where the <HI>Armenian</HI> Patriarke (for so was there one with them) went into an old Chappell, and all the rest of the Pilgrimes thronged about him, vsing many strange Ceremonies, for it was in that place (as it is sayd) <HI>That Christ fed fiue thousand people with fiue Barley loaues and two fishes.</HI> Continuing our iourney we saw Mount <HI>Tabor</HI> on our left hand, which is a pretty round Moun∣taine, beset about with comely trées: I would gladly haue séene the monument of that place, where the trans-sigura∣tion of Christ was, but the <HI>Carauan</HI> mindfull to visit <HI>Na∣zareth,</HI> left the great way of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and would by no perswasion go thither. That night we lodged in a poore vil∣lage called <HI>Heerschek,</HI> where we could get neither meat for our selues, nor prouender for the beasts; but some of our company had for their suppers, a hundred strokes from the <HI>Moores</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> in that place, because the Christian Pil∣grimes had troden vpon the graues of their dead friends, which by no meanes they can tolerate: They made no
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>
small vp-rore amongst vs, desperately throwing stones and darts till we were all glad to remoue halfe a mile from that place.</P>
<P>Aprill the tenth day, about ten of the clocke (passing the riuer <HI>Kyson</HI>) we arriued at <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and there reposed till the euening, prouiding our selues of victuals and water: In this Towne dwelt <HI>Ioseph</HI> and the virgin <HI>Mary</HI>; and in which also our Sauiour was brought vp.</P>
<P>After we had dined, the <HI>Armenians</HI> arose, and went to a heape of stones, the ruines of an old house, before the which they fell downe vpon their knées, praising God: and that ruinons lumpe (say they) was the house where <HI>Mary</HI> dwelt when <HI>Gabriel</HI> saluted her, bringing the Annuntiati∣on of saluation to the world: I am fully perswaded they carried away aboue fiue thousand pound weight to kéepe in a memoriall thereof. Then did I remember mee of the Chappell of <HI>Loretta,</HI> and told the <HI>Carauan</HI> that I saw that house standing in <HI>Italy,</HI> which (as the <HI>Romanists</HI> say) was transported by the Angels: O, sayd he, we <HI>Armenians</HI> can∣not beléeue that, neither many other assertions of y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Roman</HI> Church; for we certainly know by Christians, that haue from time to time dwelt here euer since, that this is both the place, and stones of the house: Let Papists coyne a new law to themselues, we care not: for as they erre in this, so do they in all, following meerly the traditions of men, they run gallopping post to hell. The Patriarke being infor∣med by the laughing <HI>Carauan</HI> of these newes, asking me in disdaine (thinking it had béene an Article of my beliefe) if I saw the house,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Speeches of the Patriarke.</HI></NOTE> or beléeued that the Chappell of <HI>Loretta</HI> was such a thing: I answered, I did not beléeue it, affir∣ming it was onely but a diuellish inuention, to deceiue the blind-folded people, and to fill the Coffers of the Romane Priests. Now thou bottomlesse gulfe of Papistry, here I forsake thee, no winter blasting Furies of Satans subtill stormes can make ship-wracke of my faith, on the stony shelues of thy deceitfull déepes.</P>
<P>In the time of our staying here, the <HI>Emeere</HI> or Lord of
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>
the Towne sent sixe women, conducted by twelue of his seruanes, to an <HI>Armenian</HI> Prince, that was a Pilgrime in our company; to be vsed by him, and others, whom so he would elect to be his fellow labourers: which indéed he did kindly accept, and inuited me to that feast; but I gaue him the refusall, little regarding such a friuolous commodity. He and some of the chifest Pilgrimes entertained them for the space of thrée houres, and sent them backe, giuing to their Conductors 15 <HI>Piasters</HI> in a reward. Truely, if I would rehearse the impudency of these whoores,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The villany of Armenians.</HI></NOTE> and the brutishnesse of the <HI>Armenians,</HI> as it is most ignominious to the actors; so no doubt it would bee very loathsome to the reader. Such is the villanie of these Orientall Christian-flaues, vnder the Turkes; that not onely by conuersing with them, learne some of their damnable Ethnicke cu∣stomes, but also going beyond them in beastly sensuality, become worse then bruit beasts: but God, in his iust iudg∣ments, that same night, threatned to haue punished both the doers, and the whole company for their sakes: for we ha∣uing resolued to trauell all that night; and also because the way was rocky, and hard to be knowne, and perillous for <HI>Arabs,</HI> we hired a Christian Guide, named <HI>Ioab,</HI> and agréed with him to take vs to <HI>Lidda,</HI> which was two dayes iour∣ney. But before we tooke horse, <HI>Ioab</HI> had sent a priuy mes∣senger before vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A strange con∣spiracy.</HI></NOTE> to warne about 300 <HI>Arabs</HI> (who had their abode on the South side of mount <HI>Carmel</HI>) to méet him at such a place as he had appointed; giuing them to know wée were potent and rich; and that hee should render vs into their hands, to be made the miserable obiect of their cruelty. This being done, and vnknowne to vs, we marched riding faster then an ordinary pace; which our guide suspecting, that by our celerity we should goe beyond the place appoin∣ted for his treacherous plot, began to crosse vs grieuously, leading vs vp and downe amongst pooles and holes, whi∣ther hee listed; where many of our Cammels and Asses were lost and could not bee recouered, because wee all beganne to suspect and feare; which was the cause that the
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>
owners durst not stay to relieue their perishing Beasts.</P>
<P>In the end the Captaine and Ianisaries en treated him earnestly to bring vs in the right way; but the more they requested, the more obdurate was his heart, replying, hee was mistaken, and could not finde it till day light: vpon the which wordes the company was stayed, and in the meane while there came a Turke, one of our Souldiers, vnto the Captaine, saying; Hee saw the guide, before our departure from <HI>Nazareth,</HI> send a <HI>Moore</HI> before him, for what respect he knew not, being long at priuate conference. Wherupon they straight bound him with ropes on a horse backe, threatning him with death, to cause him confesse the truth.</P>
<P>In the midst of this tumult, I hauing got sight of the Northstarre, considered thereby, that the villaine had led vs more to the Southward then to the Westward, which was our way to Ierusalem: <HI>Whereupon I entreated the Carauan to turne our faces Northward, otherwise we should bee cut off, and that suddenly: for although (said I) it may peraduenture be, that we are 3 or 4 miles short of the place intended for our massacre; yet they missing vs, wil like raue∣ning Wolues hunt here and there; wherefore if wee incline to the North (God willing) wee shall preuent their bloudy designes.</HI> To which aduice (being duly pondered) they yeelded; and so I became their guide in the darks night, till morning: for none of them knew that starre, neither the nature of it. At last this desperate wretch, considering that either by our vanquishing, or the enemies victory, he could not escape, sith his treason was reuealed, began to beg par∣don of the <HI>Carauan</HI> saying, that if he could haue any surety of his life, hee would sufficiently informe vs how to escape these imminent dangers. The Captaine being distracted with feare, replied hee would; and thereupon swore a so∣lemne oath, so did the <HI>Ianisaries</HI> sweare by the head of <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> for the like effect: which being done, he was vntied, and confessed, that if we had continued in our way he led vs, we had beene all put to the edge of the sword, and fal∣ling
<PB N="83" REF="45"/>
downe on his knees, cryed oft with teares, mercy, mercy, mercy.</P>
<P>All that night wee went with that starre,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The desolati∣on of Tyrus.</HI></NOTE> and against morning wee were in <HI>Palestina,</HI> neere vnto <HI>Tyrus,</HI> called now <HI>Sur:</HI> which <HI>Alexander</HI> had so much adoe to conquer; being then separated from the maine Continent by the Sea, but now ioyned to the firme Land; and before you come to the Citie, there lieth a great banke of Sand, where it is likely the sea hath beene in <HI>Alexanders</HI> time, though now, as time altereth euery thing, the sea be fled from that place; which maketh that ruinous Towne more desolate. <HI>Aurora</HI> no sooner appeared, but we were all encouraged, for the light of day lends comfort. The Captaine (sending backe that false <HI>Iudas,</HI> for so was hee sworne to doe) sent a Post to <HI>Tyrus</HI> for a new Guide, who came forth∣with, and brought vs in our way to Mount <HI>Carmell,</HI> for by it we behoued to go.</P>
<P>Great are the mercies of God! for as he hath made man an excellent creature, so hath he also indued him with two great powers in his minde: the one a wise power of vnder∣standing, by which hee penetrateth into the knowledge of things; the other a strong power of dexterous resoluing, whereby he executeth things wel vnderstood, for we hauing iudged the worst, resolued the best; and by his Almightie prouidence were fréed from that apparant danger, although the former dayes whoredome, &amp; vnnaturall vices deserued a iust punishment. This I intimate to all trauellers in ge∣nerall, <HI>that if they would that God should further them in their attempts, blesse their voyages, and grant them a safe re∣turne to their natiue Countries (without the which, what contentment haue they for all their paines) that they would constantly refraine from whoredome, drunkennesse, and too much familiarity with strangers: For a traueller that is not temperate, and circumspect in all his actions, although hee were headed like that Herculean Serpent▪ Hydra, yet it is impossible hee can returne in safety from danger of Turkes, Arabs, Moores, wilde beasts, heate, hunger, thirst and cold.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="46"/>Approching to mount <HI>Carmell,</HI> I beheld a farre off vpon the top of the hill, the place where <HI>Elias</HI> ascended to heauen when he left his Cloke behind him to <HI>Elizeus</HI> his Disciple. This mountaine is foure miles of length, lying South and North, the North end bordering with the sea, neere to <HI>A∣cre,</HI> called anciently <HI>Ptolomais</HI>; and the South end ioyning with the borders of <HI>Samaria.</HI></P>
<P>Leauing <HI>Samaria</HI> on our left hand, we entred into a faire plaine, adorned with fruitful trees, and all other ornaments that pleasant fields affoord, but no village we saw. March∣ing thus, about the declining of the Sun from the Meridi∣an, we came in sight of two hundred pauillions, all pitched in rankes, yéelding the prospect of a little Cittie, by a brooke side of water: which being perceiued, the Captaine began to censure what they might be, and immediatly there came riding towards vs, sixe naked fellowes, well mounted on <HI>Arabian</HI> geldings, who demanded what we were, and whi∣ther wee were bound; and if there were any, <HI>Frankes</HI> of Christendome in our company. To whom the Ianisa∣ries replied, wee were purposed to Ierusalem, and that there was but one <HI>Franke</HI> with them: vpon the which they presently sought me,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caffar, tribute.</HI></NOTE> demanding <HI>Caffar, Caffar,</HI> and caused me perforce to pay seuen Chickens of gold for my head; because (say they) our King is now resident in these Tents, he must pay therefore so much the more extraordi∣nary.</P>
<P>They returning backe to their Prince with the maledi∣ction of a Pilgrimes purse, and we marching on our way, that day we trauelled aboue 34 miles, and pitched at a vil∣lage called <HI>Adoash</HI>; where we found good hearbes to eate, and aboundance of water to drink, and also to fill our emp∣tied bottles: As we lay downe to sléepe after a hungry sup∣per, on the hard ground, and our guard watching vs, that same King of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> came a little before mid-night with 24 well horsed Runagates, and naked Courtiers, be∣ing armed with bowes and arrowes, and halfe-pikes, poin∣ted at both ends with hard stéele; and asked for the <HI>Carauan</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="46"/>
who presently awoke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The courtesie of Turkes.</HI></NOTE> and went to salute him, laying his hand on his breast, bowed his head very low; which is the vsuall courtesie amongst the Infidels and Christians in these parts: for they neuer vncouer their heads to any man; and after some short parly, they sate all downe on the grasse. The Carauan presented his rude-like Maiesty with water, bread, hearbs, figs, garlike, and such things as he had. As they were thus merry, at this poore banquet, y<SUP>e</SUP> awfull King tooke the oath of our Conductor, if there were any mo <HI>Frankes</HI> there then I; and he hauing sworne the truth, the King by a malignant informer, incontinently, caused me to be brought before him; and staring mee in the face, asked my Interpreter where were my companions? who replyed, I had none: Then, said he, tell that dog, hee must acknowledge me with fiue péeces of gold more,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The extortion of the Arabian King.</HI></NOTE> other∣wise (making a signe to his owne throate) I shall cut off his head: The which I being informed, and knowing that by no condition, there was resistance against such a scele∣rate Prince, gaue it to him presently with a halfe smiling countenance; which hee remarking, told the rest, it seemed that I gaue it with a good heart; and to recompence my outward behauiour, he drunke a great draught of water to me, thinking thereby, he had done mee more ho∣nour, then all the chickens of gold I gaue him now, and in the morning, would do him profite. Truely, this was one of the greatest tributes I paied for one daies iourney, that I had in all my voyage, in <HI>Asia.</HI> There are two Kings in <HI>Arabia,</HI> the one who liueth on <HI>Euphrates,</HI> the De∣sarts of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> sometimes in <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> and in some parts of <HI>Siria:</HI> And the other (which was the King to whom I paid this money) wandereth with his Tribes, Tents, and Bestial) one while in <HI>Arabia Petrea,</HI> and <HI>Deserta,</HI> and sometimes in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> as he findeth good Pastorage, and fresh fountaines. These two Kings are mortall enemies; and if by accident they meete, they fight most cruelly, bringing dammage, rapine, and de∣struction to themselues, and their followers; for it is a diffi∣cult

thing in them to dominate their inordinate passions, being vntamed Sauages, and mis-regarders of ciuility; who continually contend to corroborate the malignity of their dispositions, with bloudy and inhumane enter∣prises.</P>
<P>The next morning, leauing <HI>Iacobs</HI> Well, and the Town of <HI>Sychar</HI> on our left hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sychar, of old the chiefest Citie in Sama∣ria, is now al∣together rui∣nated.</HI></NOTE> wee marched through a part of the fields of <HI>Basan,</HI> and had excéeding pleasant trauel∣ling, and at night we pitched by <HI>Lydda</HI> on the fields: <HI>Lydda</HI> is not aboue ten miles from <HI>Cesarea.</HI> The Townes situa∣ted by the Sea side in <HI>Palestina</HI> are these; <HI>Sydon,</HI> which stan∣deth on the borders of <HI>Zebulon,</HI> and <HI>Nephtalim,</HI> or <HI>Phoe∣nicia,</HI> being a goodly Citie and well peopled: <HI>Tyrus,</HI> which is miserably brought to ruine: <HI>Acre,</HI> that hath yet some in∣different Trade of Merchandize: <HI>Caipha,</HI> called com∣monly <HI>Castello pellegrino,</HI> which hath nothing but the remnants of an ancient Abbay: <HI>Cesarea,</HI> who reserueth but onely the memory; for there is no hospitality in it, ex∣cept it be to wilde beasts: <HI>Ioppa,</HI> or <HI>Iaphta,</HI> is a sea-port of small Barkes, but the decayed Towne containeth not one dwelling house, saue onely a high Towre, which de∣fendeth the port from Cursares: And <HI>Baruti</HI> is also thought to bée within <HI>Canaan,</HI> but that I suspend, as not hauing had the certainety thereof. These are all the Hauens in the <HI>Holy Land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aprill</HI> the thirtéenth, before the breach of day, setting forward, scarcely were we well aduanced in our way, till we were beset with more then three hundred <HI>Arabs,</HI> who sent vs an vnexpected shoare of arrowes, to the great anoy∣ance of all our company: for if it had not béene, that our souldiers shot of their Guns on a sudden, surely wee had then miserably perished. But the nature of the <HI>Arabs</HI> is not vnlike to the <HI>Iackals:</HI> for when any of them heare the shot of a Harquebuse, they run backe with such spéed, as if the fiends of the infernall Court were broken loose vpon them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A massacre of Armenian pil∣grimes.</HI></NOTE> In that momentany conflict, on our side, there were killed nine women, fiue men, and about thirty persons
<PB N="87" REF="47"/>
deadly wounded, which to our worthy Captaine bred no small griefe. Till bright day came, wee stayed still in that same place, and buried the slaine people in deep graues, rol∣ling aboue them heauy stones, whereby <HI>Iackals</HI> should not open their graues to eate the corps: for such is the nature of these cruell beasts, that they onely loue to liue on mans flesh: These rauenous beasts (as is thought) are ingendred of a Fox and a Wolfe.</P>
<P>Procéeding in our iourney, in the Hilly Country of <HI>Iu∣dea,</HI> we entred, leauing <HI>Rhama</HI> on our right hand: <HI>Rhama</HI> is a Towne inhabited by Christians, <HI>Arabs,</HI> and <HI>Moores</HI>; not blacke <HI>Moores,</HI> as the <HI>Affricans</HI> be, but they are called <HI>Mori,</HI> which are a kind of <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and not naturally blacke, but sun-burnt, with the parching heat: The whole Territory of <HI>Canaan,</HI> is inhabited with these <HI>Moores,</HI> some <HI>Turkes,</HI> ciuill <HI>Arabs,</HI> and a few Christians and scatte∣red <HI>Iewes.</HI> The <HI>Arabians</HI> are, for the most part, Theeues, and Robbers, the <HI>Moores</HI> cruell, and vnciuill, hating Chri∣stians to the death: The <HI>Turkes</HI> are the best of all the thrée, yet all sworne enemies to Christ. But when they know how to make any gaine by strangers, O what a dissi∣mulate ostentation shall appeare in these detestable vil∣laines.</P>
<P>About two of the clocke in the after-noone wee arriued at <HI>Berah,</HI> called of old <HI>Beersheba,</HI> being eleuen miles distant from <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Hauing a little reposed, we embraced our mountainous way as cheerefully as we could, for we were excéeding faint, and trauelled that day aboue three and forty miles, whereby we might arriue at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> before the gates were shut, sustaining drouth, heate, hunger, and not a few other inconueniences. At last we beheld the pros∣pect of <HI>Ierusalem</HI>; which was not onely a contentment to my wearied body, but also being rauished with a kind of vnwonted reioycing, the teares gushed from mine eies for too much ioy. In this time the <HI>Armenians</HI> began to sing in their owne fashion, Psalmes to praise the Lord; and I also sung the 103 Psalme all the way, till we arriued neere the
<PB N="88" REF="48"/>
walles of the Citie, where wee ceased from our singing for feare of the Turkes.</P>
<P>The Sunne being passed to his nightly repose, before our arriuall, wee found the gates locked, and the Keyes car∣ryed vp to the <HI>Bashaw</HI> in the Castle; which bred a common sorrow in the company, being all both hungry, and weary; yet the Carauan entreated earnestly the Turkes within, to giue vs ouer the walles, some victuals for our money, shewing heauily the necessity wee had thereof, but they would not, neither durst attempt such a thing: In this time the Guardian of the Monastery of <HI>Cordeleirs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monastery of Friars.</HI></NOTE> who remaineth there to receiue Trauellers of Christendome, hauing got newes of our arriuing, came and demanded of the <HI>Carauan,</HI> if any <HI>Franks</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> were in his socie∣ty; And he said, onely one. Then the Guardiano called mee, and asked mee of what Nation I was? and when I told him, he seemed to bee exceeding glad: yet sorrowfull for our misfortune. He hauing knowing my distresse, returned, and sent two Friers to mee with bread, wine and fishes, which they let ouer the wall (as they thought, in a secret place) but they were espied, and on the morrow the Guardiano payed to the Bashaw a great fine, otherwise he had béene beheaded; for the Turkes alledged, he had taken in munition from the Christians, to betray the Citie: This they do oft, for a lesser fault then that was, onely to get bribes, and money from the Grey Friers.</P>
<P>Aprill the foureteenth day, vpon Palme-sunday in the morning, we entred into <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and at the gate wee were particularly searched, to the effect wee carried in no furniture of Armes, nor poulder with vs, and the <HI>Armeni∣ans</HI> (notwithstanding they are slaues to Turkes) behoued to render their weapons, to the Keepers, such is the feare they haue of Christians: The gates of the Citie are of yron outwardly, and aboue each gate are brasen Ordinance planted, for their owne defence.</P>
<P>Hauing taken my leaue of the Carauan and the com∣pany,

<P><HI>Ierusalem</HI> standeth in the same place where old <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI> stood, but not so populous, neither in each respect of bredth, or length, so spacious: for on the South side of <HI>Ie∣rusalem,</HI> a great part of Mount <HI>Syon</HI> is left without, which was anciently the heart of the old Citie; and they haue ta∣ken on the North side, now both Mount <HI>Caluarie,</HI> and the holy Graue within the walles, which were built by <HI>Sultan Selim:</HI> So that thereby the difference of the situation is not so great, though a part thereof be remoued; but a man may boldly affirme, that the most part of this Citie is buil∣ded on that place where the first <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was: As may truely appeare, and is made manifest by these Moun∣taines, mentioned in the Scriptures, whereupon <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI> is both situate, and inuironed about, who reserue their names to this day, and are still seene, and knowne by the same; as Mount <HI>Syon,</HI> Mount <HI>Caluarie,</HI> Mount <HI>Mo∣riah,</HI> and Mount <HI>Oliuet.</HI> The forme of the situation of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> is now like to a Hart or Triangle, the one point whereof looketh East, extending downeward, almost to the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> which diuideth <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and Mount <HI>Oliuet:</HI> The second head of point, bendeth out South-west vpon <HI>Syon,</HI> bordering néere to the Ualley of <HI>Gehinnon:</HI> The third corner lyeth on Mount <HI>Moriah,</HI> toward the North, and by-West, hauing the prospect to the buriall place of the Kings of <HI>Israel.</HI> The walles are high, and strongly builded with <HI>Saxo quadrato,</HI> which adorne <HI>Ierusalem</HI> more then any thing within it, the holy Graue excepted. It is of circuite about thrée miles, and a halfe, of our measure. As touching the former glory of this Citie, I will not meddle withall, nor yet describe, sith the Scriptures so amply manifest the same; and con∣cerning the lamentable destruction of it, I referre
<PB N="91" REF="49"/>
that to the famous Historiographer <HI>Iosephus,</HI> who large∣ly discourseth, of many hundred thousands famished, and put to the sword within this multi-potent Citie by <HI>Vespasian,</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> his sonne; being the messen∣gers of Gods iust iudgements; which by his computa∣tion, amount beyond the number of eleuen hundred thousands.</P>
<P>This Citie hath béene oft conquered by enemies: first, by <HI>Nebuchodonosor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The oft con∣quering of Ie∣rusalem.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Assyrian</HI> King: Secondly, by the <HI>Greekes,</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and also maruellously afflicted by <HI>Antiochus:</HI> Thirdly, it was taken in by <HI>Pom∣peius:</HI> Fourthly, destroyed of <HI>Vespasian,</HI> and <HI>Titus:</HI> Fiftly, it was re-edifyed by <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperrour, and wonne againe by <HI>Gosdroes,</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> King: Sixthly, it was ouercome by <HI>Homar Califf</HI> the successour of <HI>Mahomet:</HI> Seuenthly, by the great <HI>Souldan</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and by <HI>Godfrey de Bulleine,</HI> a Christian Prince: Eightly, by <HI>Salidine</HI> the <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Damascus</HI>; who reserued successiuely the Signiory thereof, for a long time: And lastly, it was surprised by <HI>Sultan Selim,</HI> or <HI>Solyman</HI> the Emperor of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> who fortified the same, being by Infidels detained to this day: And by likly-hood shall keepe it to the consum∣mation of the world, vnlesse God of his mercy deale other∣wise, then the hopes of mans weake iudgement can expect. But, to the intent the Reader may the better conceiue, and plainely vnderstand the Monuments I saw within <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and the circumiacent places of <HI>Iudea</HI>; I thought best to prefixe the description thereof, by the seuerall daies, as I saw them, not much condemning, neither absolutely qualifying them, but shall (as it were) neutrally nominate and recapitulate these places, as I was informed, by the <HI>Padre Guardiano,</HI> who is euery third yeare changed, and especially <HI>Iohn Baptista,</HI> the <HI>Trouch-man,</HI> who hath dwelt at <HI>Ierusalem</HI> 25 yeares: for he that vnderstandeth not promptly the <HI>Italian</HI> tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The ignorāce of Pilgrimes, who can not speake Italian.</HI></NOTE> which they vsually speake when they demonstrate these places to vs; he shall conceiue ignorantly, dispose his iudgement blindfoldedly, &amp; knowes

not how to distinguish the circumstances and qualities of the things deliuered. As I haue knowne some of these <HI>Frankes</HI> in my company, simply mistaken, euen when the exposition of euery obiect was largely manifested vnto them; and precisely declared such a thing to haue béen there, although perhaps the matter it selfe be euanished and trans∣ported.</P>
<P>Aprill 14. on Palm-sunday after dinner, the <HI>Guardiano</HI> departed from <HI>Ierusalem</HI> to <HI>Bethphage,</HI> accompanied with twelue Friers, and many other Orientall Christians, which were come thither to that festiuall time, but I by no meanes would go, reposing my selfe till their returne. The ridiculous ceremony which that day they vse, is thus. In an Apish imitation of Christ, at the foresaid <HI>Bethphage,</HI> there was an Asse brought to the <HI>Guardiano,</HI> whereupon he mounted (being as it were, the greater Asse riding vpon the lesser) and came riding to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the people cutting downe boughs of trées, and also dispoyling themselues al∣most to the skin, bestrewed the way as he rode along, cry∣ing, <HI>Hosanna, Hosanna, the sonne of Dauid, blessed is he, that commeth in the name of the Lord,</HI> vntill they came to the South gate of <HI>Sion,</HI> where he dismounted. At night after supper, the <HI>Guardiano</HI> knowing that I was a Protestant, and also some other <HI>Frankes,</HI> made an Oration, saying, <HI>You Pilgrimes, who refuse to bee participant with vs in the Sa∣craments, or will not adhere to the processions &amp; ceremo∣nies, which we follow of the Roman Church, I would ther∣fore intreate you (your liberty beeing here as much as mine, whereby you may doe whatsoeuer seeme good in our owne eyes) onely to abstaine from scandalizing and mocking our rites &amp; ordinary customes, which at this great feast we must performe.</HI> To the which we condescended, and promised to giue no occasion of offence. In the conclusion of his long exhortation, he disclosed this admonition, saying, All you Trauellers must in general be indued with these thrée wor∣thy gifts, <HI>Faith, Patience,</HI> and <HI>Money; Faith,</HI> to beléeue these things you shall sée and heare at <HI>Ierusalem; Patience,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="50"/>
to endure the apparant iniuries of Infidels; and <HI>Money,</HI> to discharge all tributes and costs, which here (meaning in his owne Monasterie) and about this Citie, must bee de∣frayed. His Sermon hee concluded like a grey Frier, as indéed he was; for I am fully perswaded hee little cared for our Faith and Patience, prouiding that our Purses could answere his expectation, as truely we found the triall after∣ward.</P>
<P>Munday early, wee Pilgrimes went forth to view the Monuments within the Citie, being accompanied with the <HI>Padre Viccario,</HI> and a <HI>French Predicatore:</HI> the places of any note we saw, were these; First they shewed vs the place where Christ appeared to <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> who said, <HI>Touch me not, for I am not as yet ascended to my Father, Ioh.</HI> 20, 15. and in this place by them is supposed to be the center, or middle part of the world. Next, where S. <HI>Iames</HI> the first Bi∣shop of the primitiue Church was beheaded; then the house of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> but that is doubtfull (say they) because it is not yet confirmed by the Papall Authority; from thence they brought vs to the place where <HI>Annas</HI> one of the high Priests dwelt, and also the trée to which our Sauiour was bound, whiles <HI>Annas</HI> was making himselfe ready to leade him to <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> but that I will not beléeue, for that trée groweth yet, being an Oliue trée. They shewed vs also the house where S. <HI>Peter</HI> was imprisoned, and where <HI>Zebedeus</HI> the father of <HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> dwelt, which are nothing but a lumpe of ruines.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Abisines are borne na∣turally blacke, and these silly religious men of them that stay at Ierusa∣lem, weare on their heads flot round caps of a blackish co∣lour, &amp; on their bodies linnen clothes.</HI></NOTE> Thence we came to the decaied lodging of <HI>Caiphas,</HI> without the Citie, vpon the mount <HI>Sion,</HI> where∣vpon there is Chappell builded, and at the entry of that lit∣tle <HI>domo,</HI> we saw the stone on which the Cocke crew, when <HI>Peter</HI> denied Christ. Within the same place is the Stone that was rolled to the Sepulchre doore of our Sauiour; being now made an Altar to the <HI>Abasenes,</HI> a kinde of peo∣ple which came from <HI>Prester Iehans</HI> dominions. And with∣in that Chappell they shewed vs a narrow pit, wherein (say they) Christ was incarcerate the night before hee was brought to the Iudgement Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="51"/>Upon the same side of <HI>Sion</HI> we saw the place where Christ Christ did institute the Sacraments; and not farre hence, a decayed house, where (say they) the Holy Ghost des∣cended vpon the Apostles, and also the Sepulchre of <HI>Da∣uid,</HI> and his sonne <HI>Salomon:</HI> ouer the which there is a Moskée, wherein no Christian may enter to sée these Mo∣numents.</P>
<P>From thence we returned, and entred <HI>in via dolorosa,</HI> the dolorous way, by which our Lord and Sauiour passed, when hee went to bee crucified; and at the end of the same stréet, here (say they) the Souldiers met <HI>Simon</HI> of <HI>Cyrene,</HI> and compelled him to helpe Christ to beare his Crosse when he fainted. <HI>Pilats</HI> iudgement Hall is altogether ruinated, hauing but onely betwéene the two sides of the Lane, an old Arch of stone, vnder the which I passed, standing full in the high way. Here they shewed vs the place where Christ first tooke vp his Crosse, and on the toppe of that Arch wee saw that place called <HI>Gabbatha,</HI> where Iesus stood, when <HI>Pilate</HI> said to the Iewes, <HI>Ecce homo.</HI> A little below this, they brought vs to the Church of S. <HI>Anna,</HI> where (say they) the virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was borne. And going downe ano∣ther narrow lane, they pointed vnto a house, and said, here <HI>Diues</HI> the rich Glutton dwelt, who would not giue to <HI>Lazarus</HI> the crummes of bread that fell from his ta∣ble; this I suspend, amongst many other things, for all hold it to be a Parable, and not a History: and although it were a Historie, who can demonstrate the particular place, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> hauing béen so often transformed by alterations. This I must néeds say, with such lying wonders these flat∣tering Friers bring strangers into a wonderfull admirati∣on, and although I rehearse all I saw there, yet I will not beléeue all, onely publishing them as things indifferent, some whereof are friuolous, and other somewhat more cre∣dible: but as I said before, I will make no (or very small) distinction in the relation.</P>
<P>From thence we came without the Easterne gate, vnto an immoueable stone, vpon the which they said <HI>S. Stephen</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>
was stoned to death; and néere to that we saw <HI>Porta aurea,</HI> that is, the golden port, called in former times, <HI>the beauti∣full Gate of the Temple:</HI> which the Turkes haue filled vp with stones, because of a Prophesie, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Citie was once wonne there, and shall bee wonne againe at the same place.</P>
<P>As we returned to the Couent, they brought vs to mount <HI>Moriah,</HI> and shewed vs the place where <HI>Abraham</HI> offered vp <HI>Isaac,</HI> which is in the custody of <HI>Nigroes,</HI> or <HI>Aethiopi∣ans.</HI> Next, the place where Iesus said, <HI>Daughters of Ierusa∣lem, mourne not for me, &amp;c.</HI> And néere vnto this, where the virgin <HI>Mary</HI> fell into an agony, when Iesus passed by carrying his Crosse. Also not facre hence, we beheld the place, where (as they say) Iesus said, <HI>Mother, behold thy Sonne.</HI></P>
<P>Ascending more vpward, they shewed vs the house of <HI>Veronica Sancta,</HI> and said, that our Sauiour going by her doore, all in a sweate, to mount <HI>Caluary,</HI> she brought him a napkin to wipe his face; which he receiued, and gaue it her againe: in which (say they) the print of his face remaineth to this day, and is to be séene at Rome. It is also said to be in a Towne in Spaine, wherefore I beléeue the one as well as the other. As touching the Temple of <HI>Salomon,</HI> which was destroyed, there is another great Temple buil∣ded in the same place, reserued by Turkes, for that affecti∣on they carry to <HI>Salomon</HI>; néere the which no Christian may come, vnder the paine of loosing his head. These are all the monuments which in one day I saw within <HI>Ierusalem</HI>; but as for Mount <HI>Caluary,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Graue,</HI> I saw them afterward, which in their owne place shall be orderly touched. As we were spending that day in these sights, the <HI>Guardian</HI> had prepared an hundred Souldiers, sixty Hors∣men, and forty foot-men to take with him the day follow∣ing, for his conduction to <HI>Iordan,</HI> and the Mountaine in the Wildernesse whore Christ fasted; which is his vsuall custome once euery yeare, betwéene Palme-sunday and Easter, returning againe before Good-Friday. These pla∣ces
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>
cannot be viewed, saue onely at that time; neither may a Pilgrime goe along with the Souldiers vnlesse hee giue the value of seuen French Crownes (as a propyne) vnto the Lieuetenant: that same night after supper the <HI>Guardian</HI> demanded of vs Trauellers, if we would go with him to sée these memorable and singular things, vpon the former con∣dition: To whom we answered in a generall consent, Wée would.</P>
<P>Early vpon Tuesday morning (being all of vs, both Friers and Pilgrimes, well mounted, and Mulets laden for our prouision) wee departed from the Citie with our Souldiers; and trauelled all that day through a barren and desart Countrey, till sun-setting, where wee reposed by a standing well, till an houre within night. After that the Captaine had cried <HI>Catethlanga,</HI> that is, march away; wee set forward, being well guarded round about with our kée∣pers, because we entred into a dangerous way. In all this deformed Countrey we saw neither house nor village, for it is altogether desartous, and inhabited onely by wilde beasts, and naked <HI>Arabians.</HI> Before we came néere to <HI>So∣dome</HI> and <HI>Gomorha</HI> by seuen miles (for so we behoued to passe by y<SUP>e</SUP> East end of it, before we could ariue at that place of <HI>Iordan</HI> which we intended) wee I say encountred with such deepe sandy ground, that the Mulets were not able to carry vs through: whereupon wee all dismounted, wrest∣ling and wading aboue the middle part of our bodies, and sometimes falling in ouer our heads, we were in great danger of perishing. Euen in the middest of this turmoy∣ling paine (the night being darke) the vnwelcomed <HI>Arabs</HI> inuironed and inuaded vs with a storme of arrowes which they sent from the tops of little hard hils, whereupon they stood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inuasions of Arabs.</HI></NOTE> for knowing the aduantage of the ground, they tooke opportunity to giue the more fearfull assaults; yet they pre∣uailed nothing (although they wounded some of our Soul∣diers) such was the resolute courage of our valorous defen∣dants. True it is, that in all my trauels, I was neuer so sore fatigated, or fearfully indangered, as I was that night.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="52"/>A little after midgnight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A true descrip∣tion of Sodom and Gomorha.</HI></NOTE> we left this troublesome way, and marched along the Lake of <HI>Sodome:</HI> This Lake is cal∣led <HI>Mare Mortuum,</HI> the dead sea: for of it selfe it is vnmo∣neable, such is the stability of the water: It is also called so, because if a bird flie ouer it, she presently falleth downe therein dead: and, as <HI>Salomon</HI> reporteth of it, <HI>Wisd.</HI> 10.7. it smoaketh continually; from whence proceed filthy va∣pours; which deforme the fields lying about for certaine mils, as it were blasted, scorched, and made vtterly barren: This smoake I take onely to be but the exhalation of <HI>Ior∣dan;</HI> for this riuer falling into it, and there ending his course, the two contrary natures cannot agree: the one be∣ing a filthy puddle, and the other a pure water, as I shall more approbably record. This Lake is eighty miles in length, and sixe in bredth, being compassed with the rocks of <HI>Arabia Petrea</HI> on the South: on the North, with the sandy hils of the wildernesse of <HI>Iudea:</HI> on the West, with the steepy Mountaines of <HI>Arabia deserta:</HI> and on the East, with the plaine of <HI>Iericho.</HI> How commeth it to passe therefore, that the fresh running flood of <HI>Iordan,</HI> falling euermore into this bounded sea; that the Lake it selfe, neuer diminisheth, nor increaseth, but alwaies standeth at one fulnesse: neither hath it any issuing forth, nor reboundeth backwards on the plaine of <HI>Iericho,</HI> which is one of the greatest wonders in the world. Wherefore, as I haue said, it must néeds either exhale to the clouds, or otherwise runne downe to <HI>Hell;</HI> for if it ranne vnder the rockes, and so burst forth in the desarts, it would soone be knowne; but in all the bounds of <HI>Arabia deserta,</HI> which betwixt this Lake and the red Sea, extend to three hundred miles; there is no such matter, as brooke, or strand, much lesse a riuer.</P>
<P>It bréedeth nor reserueth no kind of fishes; and if by the swelling of <HI>Iordan,</HI> any fishes be carryed to it, they im∣mediatly die. Although <HI>Iosephus</HI> witnesseth, that in his time there was an Apple grew vpon the bankes thereof, like to the colour of gold; and within was rotten, and would
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>
consume to powder; yet I affirme now the contrary: for there is not such a thing (whatsoeuer hath béene in his daies) as either trees, or bushes, grow néere to <HI>Sodome</HI> by many miles: such is the consummation of that pestiferous gulfe: Diuers Authors haue reported, that nothing will sinke into it, of any reasonable weight, as dead men, or car∣kasses of beasts; but by experience I approue the contrary: for it beareth nothing aboue at all; yea, not the weight of a feather. The water it selfe, is of a blackish colour, and at sometimes in the yeare, there are terrible shapes, and showes of terror in it, as I was informed at <HI>Iericho,</HI> which is the néerest Towne that bordereth thereupon.</P>
<P>This contagious, and pestilentious lake of <HI>Sodome,</HI> re∣sembleth much (as may be supposed) that infernall gulfe of Hell; but in my opinion, I hold it to be the purgatory of Papists: for they say <HI>Limbus Patrum</HI> is neere, or in the se∣cond roome to hell, which I thinke must néedes be <HI>Sodome</HI> for although it bee not Hell it selfe, yet I am perswaded, it is a second Hell, hauing (as some report) no botome. Wherefore I conclude thus, that since Papists will haue a Purgatory, I absolutely affirme, it must be such a Pur∣gatory, as the purging of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorha;</HI> which was with fire and brimestone.</P>
<P>About the breach of day on Tuesday morning, we past by the ruines of an old house; where (as they say) Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> the Baptist remained, when hee baptized those that came from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and other Regions about, which is but the flight of an arrow from <HI>Iordan.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iordans water is of a whitish colour.</HI></NOTE> Approaching to the banke-side, we dismounted, and vncloathed ourselues, going in naked to the riuer, we washed, vs to refresh our bo∣dies: In this place, as the <HI>Guardiano</HI> said, was <HI>Christ</HI> bap∣tized of Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> when the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> came downe in a bodily shape, like a <HI>Doue</HI> vpon him, and there was a voice from heauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 3.22.</NOTE> saying: <HI>Thou art my beloued Sonne, in thee I am well pleased.</HI> I saw also an apparant like testimony, of a quadrangled stone, lying on the banke side, whereupon are ingrauen letters, of <HI>Hebrew, Greeke,</HI> and <HI>Latine,</HI> testi∣fying
<PB N="99" REF="53"/>
the same thing; and may also bee so coniectured, in regard of the ancient Habitacle, of that precursor, which is not farre from thence.</P>
<P>This Riuer <HI>Iordan</HI> beginneth in Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> two Fountaines, <HI>Iore,</HI> and <HI>Dan,</HI> which run separated, till they come to the lake <HI>Maronah;</HI> and hence it maketh one body, keeping his course through the Lake <HI>Genesereth,</HI> en∣deth in <HI>Sodome.</HI> The riuer <HI>Tibris</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Iordan,</HI> are not much different in quantity and colour; and not vnlike in their courses:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A comparison betwixt Iordan and Tybris, whose colour and growth are both alike, and their cour∣ses agreeable thereunto.</HI></NOTE> for <HI>Iordan</HI> falleth in the old <HI>Gomorah,</HI> and <HI>Tibris</HI> runneth through the new <HI>Sodome</HI>; A Historie of such euidence, as trauell taught mee by experience: for it is the Priests confluence, which breeds in the <HI>Italians</HI> insolence: If I erre, I will begge indulgence of the Popes Aureat Magnificence. The water of <HI>Iordan</HI> hath beene transported to <HI>Venice</HI> in barrels, for that purity it hath; which will reserue vnspoyled, both monthes, and yeares, and the longer it is kept, it is the more fresher; and to drinke, it is an excellent remedy for the feuer Quartan, and Quotidian.</P>
<P>Considering the ancient reputation of this famous Ri∣uer, and the rare fight of such an vnfrequented place, I climed vp to the toppe of a <HI>Turpentine</HI> Trée, which grew within the limited floud, euen naked as I came from swimming, and cut downe a faire hunting rod, which after∣ward, with great paines, I brought to <HI>England,</HI> and did present it (as the rarest gemme of a Pilgrimes treasure) to his <HI>Maiesty.</HI> But I remember in the choosing thereof, an vnexpected accident fell out: for I being sequestrate from the sight of the company, vpon his solitary tree, with broad obscuring leaues, the Friers and Souldiers remo∣ued, kéeping their course towards <HI>Iericho;</HI> but within two furlongs from <HI>Iordan,</HI> they were baset with the formed <HI>Nocturnall</HI> enemies, who assailed them with a hard conflict: For I heartng the Harquebuse goe off, was straight in admiration, and looking downe to the place where I left my associates, they were gone; so bending my
<PB N="100" REF="54"/>
eyes a little further in the plaine, I saw them at a martiall combat: which sight, gaue mee suddenly, the threatning of despaire, not knowing whether to stay intrenched, within the circumdating leaues, to approue the euents of my auspicious fortunes: or in prosecuting a reliefe, to bée participant of their doubtfull deliuerance. In the end pondering, I could hardly, or neuer escape their hands, leapt downe from the Tree, leauing my Turkish cloathes lying vpon the ground, tooke onely in my hand the rod, and <HI>Shasse</HI> which I wore on my head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The danger of the Author being left a∣lone vpon the bankes of Ior∣dan.</HI></NOTE> and ran starke na∣ked aboue a quarter of a mile, amongst Thistles, and sharpe pointed grasse, which pittifully be-pricked the soles of my féete. Approaching on the safe side of my company, one of our souldiers broke forth on horse-backe, being deter∣mined to kill mee for my staying behind; yea, and thrée times he stroke at me with his halfe pike, but his horse be∣ing at his spéed, I preuented his cruelty, first by falling downe, next by running in amongst the thickest of the Pilgrimes, recouering my beast: Which when the <HI>Guar∣diano</HI> espied, and saw my naked body, he presently pulled of his Gowne, and threw it to me, whereby I might hide the secrets of nature: By which meanes (in the space of an houre) I was cloathed thrée manner of waies: first, like a Turke: secondly, like a wilde Arabian: and thirdly, like a Grey Frier; which was a barbarous, a sauage, and a reli∣gious habite.</P>
<P>The Captaine mitigating the fury of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> by some contributing promises, we marched toward <HI>Iericho:</HI> where we reposed, and dined, on the prouision carryed with vs. After dinner wee arose, and went to the house of <HI>Zacheus,</HI> (this was hee who sate vpon a Trée to sée our Sa∣uiour as hee passed by) the wals whereof stand to this day. <HI>Iericho</HI> is now a poore Village onely of nine dwelling hou∣ses, inhabited by a kind of <HI>Arabs</HI> (which are in subiection vnder the Gouernour of <HI>Ierusalem</HI>) but I saw many rui∣uous lumpes of the walles, and demolishings of the old Towne. Here I saw two most dainty kind of fruits, the
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>
one was a little lesser then an Apple,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A rate kind of Apples.</HI></NOTE> but more round; whose coulour was like to gold without, and within it was white as snow, and swéet like sugar. I would gladly haue eaten of them, but the Friers forbad me, saying; they were the onely pest and death vnto a stanger. The other Apple was like to a gréene Lemmon, long, and full of knots, of a reddish colour, like to a Mellone, being both delicate and wholesome; of which we did eate to satisfie the Natu∣ral appetite. From <HI>Iericho</HI> we set forward in the way of the Wildernesse, our determination being such, as to view the Mountaine whereon Christ fasted fortie dayes: where ar∣riued, being late, we durst not go vp till morning. Where∣fore we pitched that night by the fountaine of <HI>Elizeus</HI>; the water of which was of old naturally bitter, but by the prai∣ers of that diuine Prophet, was restored to a sweet taste: It is also excellent in digestion, and wil do a man no harme: for I estéeme it to be the lightest water the earth yéeldeth. Hauing on the morrow filled a Boares skinne of it, to car∣ry with mee to the mountaine, I found it so light, that I had no weight nor paine in the bearing it on my shoulders, notwithstanding the way it selfe was fastidi∣ous.</P>
<P>This Mountaie is called <HI>Quarantanam,</HI> or <HI>Quaranto,</HI> being of height,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The mountain in the wilder∣nesse, wherup∣on Christ fa∣sted</HI> 40 <HI>dayes.</HI></NOTE> by the computation of my painfull experi∣ence, aboue sixe miles, and groweth from the bottome still smaller and smaller, till that the top is couered with a little Chappell, not vnlike to the proportion of a Pyramide. There is no way to ascend vpon this Hill, saue one, which hath béene hewen out of the rocke, by the industry of men experimented in Masonry; (which was done at the cost of Quéene <HI>Helen</HI>) going vp by the degrées of 45 turnes. In all our company there were onely thrée Friers, foure Pil∣grimes, and I, that durst attempt to climbe the mountaine. After diuers dangers, and narrow passages, hauing come to the top, we entred into a caue ioyning to the Chappell, where (say they) in this place did Christ fast, and here it was that he rebuked Sathan. In our returne againe, wee
<PB N="102" REF="55"/>
had a most fearfull descending: for one Frier <HI>Laurenzo</HI> had fallen fiue hundred fadomes ouer the rocke, and broke his necke, if it had not béene for mee, who rashly and vnadui∣sedly endangered my owne life for his safety; as my patent vnder the great seale of Ierusalem, beareth sufficient testi∣mony thereof. To recite all the circumstances of his deliue∣rance, would moue some merriment to the reader, which I purposely omit to auoyd tediousnesse.</P>
<P>Hauing saluted our <HI>Padre Guardiano,</HI> and the rest of our expecters, in our way as wee returned to Ierusalem, wée rode by a ruinous Abby, where (say they) S. <HI>Ierome</HI> dwelt, and was sed there by wild Lyons. Upon Thursday at night before Good-Friday, wee went to the Holy Graue, where we staied Friday, Saturday, &amp; on Sunday, which was Ea∣ster day, we came forth: first, before we entred the Church, we gaue euery one of vs Pilgrimes, nine Chickens of gold to the Turkes, who are kéepers of the doore: next, two Chickens for our first entring the Citie: Thirdly, vnto the <HI>Padre Guardiano</HI> thrée péeces of gold, for the candles; and other things he spent in their owne ceremonies, which we behoued to pay. Both mount <HI>Caluary</HI> and the holy Graue are comprehended within one Church.</P>
<P>After we entred, the first place of any note we saw, was the place of Unction, which is a foure squared stone, inclo∣sed about within an Iron Reuele, on which (say they) the dead body of our Sauiour lay, and was embalmed, after hee was taken from the Crosse, whiles <HI>Ioseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> was preparing that new Sepulchre for him, wherein neuer man lay. From thence we came to the holy Graue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A plaine de∣scription of the Holy Graue.</HI></NOTE>The holy Graue is couered with a little Chappell, stan∣ding within a round Quire, in the west end of the Church: It hath two low and narrow entries. As wee entred the first doore, the <HI>Guardiano</HI> fell downe, <HI>ingenochiato,</HI> and kissed a stone, whereupon (hee said) the Angell stood when <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> came to the Sepulchre, to know if Christ was risen on the third day, as he promised. And within the
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>
entry of the second doore, wee saw the place where Christ our Messias was buried, and prostrating our selues in great humility, euery man according to his religion, offe∣red vp his prayers to God. The sepulchre it selfe is eight foote and a halfe in length, and aduanced about thrée foot in height from the ground, and three foot fiue inches broad, being couered with a faire Marble stone of white colour. In this Chappell are alwayes burning aboue fifty Lampes, maintained by Christian Princes, and they stand within a band of pure gold, which is excéeding sumptuous; hauing the names of those, who sent or gaue them, ingrauen vpon the vpper edges of the round circles. I demanded of the <HI>Guardiano</HI> if any part of the Tombe were yet extant, who replied, there was; but because (said he) Christians resor∣ting thither, being deuoutly moued with affection to the place, carryed away part thereof, which caused S. <HI>Helen</HI> to inclose it vnder this stoue; whereby some reliques of it should alwayes remaine. I make no doubt but that same place is <HI>Golgotha,</HI> where the holy Graue was, as may ap∣peare by the distance betweene Mount <HI>Caluary</HI> and this sa∣cred Monument; which extendeth to forty of my paces. This Chappell is outwardly decored with fifteene couple of Marble Pillars, and of 22 foot high; and aboue the vp∣per Couerture of the same Chappell, there is a little sixe-angled Turret made of Cedar Wood, couered with lead, and beautified with sixe small Columnes of the same trée.</P>
<P>The forme of the Quiere wherein it standeth, is like vn∣to that ancient <HI>Rotundo</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> but a great deale higher and larger, hauing two gorgeous Galleries one aboue ano∣ther, and adorned with magnificent Columnes, being o∣pen at the toppe, with a large round, which yéeldeth to the heauens the prospect of that most sacred place. From thence we marched to Mount <HI>Caluary,</HI> where we ascended by one and twenty steps, made partly of Wood, and partly of A∣labaster stone: and there I saw a hole in a rocke of a cubite deepe, beautified with thicke boords of siluer, and ingrafted
<PB N="104" REF="56"/>
letters; in which (say they) the Crosse stood whereon our Sauiour was crucified. Leauing Mount <HI>Caluary</HI> on our left hand, we came to the Tomb of <HI>Godfrey de Bullion,</HI> who was the first proclaimed Christian King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and refused to be crowned there, saying, it was not decent, the seruants head should be crowned with gold, where the Ma∣sters head had béene crowned with thornes; hauing this in∣scription engrauen on the one side:</P>
<P><HI>Hic iacet inclytus Godfridus de Bullion, qui totam hanc terram acquisiuit cultui diuino, cuius anima requiescat in pace.</HI></P>
<P>And ouer-gainst it, is the Tombe of King <HI>Baldwine</HI> his brother, which hath these Uerses in golden Letters curi∣ously indented.</P>
<Q><L>Rex Baldevinus, Iudas alter Machabeus.</L>
<L>Spes patriae, Vigor Ecclesiae, Virtusvtriusque;</L>
<L>Quem formidabant, cui dona, tributa ferebant.</L>
<L>Caesar Aegypti Dan, ac homicida Damascus.</L>
<L>Proh dolor! in modico clauditur hoc Tumulo.</L></Q>
<P>The other things within the Church they shewed vs, were these, a marble pillar, whereunto (say they) our Sa∣uiour was bound, when he was whipped and scourged for sakes: the place in a low Cellar, about 14 degrées vnder the ground where the Crosse was hid by the Iewes, and found againe by S. <HI>Helen:</HI> the place where Christ was crowned with Thornes, which is reserued by the <HI>Abasines,</HI> and where the Souldiers cast lots for his Garments; the place where he was imprisoned, whiles they were making of his Crosse, and where the Crosse being laid along vpon the ground, our Sauiour was nailed fast to it; the Rocke, which (as they say) rent at his crucifying, which is more likely to be done with hammers, and set one péece a foote from another, for the slit lookes, as if it had béen cleft with wedges and béetles.</P>
<P>And lastly they take vpon them below <HI>Caluary</HI> to shew
<PB N="105" REF="56"/>
where the head of <HI>Adam</HI> was buried. These and many other things are so doubtfull, that I doe not register them for truth (I meane in demonstrating the particular places) but onely relate them as I was informed.</P>
<P>There are seuen sorts of Nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The life of re∣ligious Chri∣stians.</HI></NOTE> different in Religion and language, who continually (enduring life) remaine within this Church, hauing incloystred lodgings ioyning to the walles thereof: Their victuals are brought daily to them by their familiars, receiuing the same at a great hole in the Church doore: for the Turkes seldome open the en∣try, vnlesse it be when Pilgrimes come: for this purpose each family haue a Bell fastned at their lodging, with a string reaching from thence to the Church doore, the end wherof hangeth outwardly; by the which commodity each furnisher ringing the Bell, giueth warning to his friends, to come receiue their necessaries. The number of those, who are tied to this austere life, are about 350 persons being <HI>Ita∣lians, Greekes, Armenians, Aethiopians, Iacobines,</HI> a sort of circumcised Christians, Nestorians and Chelfaines of <HI>Me∣sopotamia.</HI> The day before the resurrection, about the houre of Mid-night, the whole Sects and sorts of Christians O∣rientall (that were come thither in Pilgrimage, and dwelt at <HI>Ierusalem</HI>) conuened together, which were about the number of 6000 men, women and children: for being sepa∣rated by the Patriarkes in two companies, they compassed the Chappell of the holy Graue nine times; holding in their hands, burning Candles, made in the beginning pit∣tifull and lamentable regréetings, but in the ending, there were touking of Kettle-drummes, sounding of horne-trumpets, and other instruments, dauncing, leaping, and running about the sepulchre, with an intolerable tumult, as if they were all mad, or distracted of their wits. Thus is the prograce of their procession performed in meere sim∣plicitie, wanting ciuilitie and gouernment. But the <HI>Turks</HI> haue a care of that; for in the midst of all this hurly-burly, they run amongst them with long roddes, correcting their mis-behauiour with cruell strokes. Thus are the slauish
<PB N="106" REF="57"/>
people, euen at the height of their ceremonious deuotion, strangely abused.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An order of Knight-hood.</HI></NOTE>Here the <HI>Guardiano</HI> offered for ten péeces of gold, (al∣though my duébe 30 Chickens said he) to make me knight of the holy Graue, or of the Order of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which I refused, knowing the condition of that detestable Oath I behooued to haue sworne; but I saw two other Pilgrimes receiue that Order of Knight-hood. The manner whereof is thus; First they binde themselues with a solemne vow, to pray (enduring life) for the <HI>Pope,</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> from whom the Friers receiue their maintenance; and also in speciall for the <HI>French</HI> King, by whose meanes they obtaine liberty of the great <HI>Turke</HI> to frequent these monumentall places. Secondly, they are sworne enemies to all Protestants, and others, who will not acknowledge the superiority of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. Thirdly, they must pay yearely some stipend to the order of the <HI>Franciscans.</HI> These attestations ended, the Frier putteth a gilded spurre on his right héele, causing the yong made knight to stoop down on his knées, and lay his hands on the holy Graue: after this he taketh a broad sword from vnder his gowne (being priuately carried for feare of the <HI>Turks</HI>) which is (as he said) the sword wherwith victorious <HI>Godfrey</HI> conquered <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> &amp; giueth this new vpstart <HI>Caualiero,</HI> nine blowes vpon his right shoulder. Loe here the fashion of this Papisticall Knight-hood, which I for∣sooke. After our <HI>Guardiano</HI> had ended his superstitious rites and ceremonies, vpon Easter day wee returned to the Monasterie, hauing stayed thrée dayes within that Church.</P>
<P>Aprill the two and twentie, on Munday morning, the <HI>Padre viccario,</HI> and the aforesaid <HI>Iohn Baptista</HI> accompany∣ing vs, we rode abrode in the hilly Countrey of <HI>Iudea.</HI> In this dayes iourney, the places of any note wee saw were these; First, where the Daughters of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> came forth to méete <HI>Saul,</HI> crying <HI>Saul hath slaine his thousand, and Dauid his his ten thousand.</HI> Next, the valley of <HI>Trebin,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="57"/>
where <HI>Dauid</HI> slew the great <HI>Goliah.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>Bezura,</HI> where <HI>Absalom</HI> kild his brother <HI>Ammon</HI> for <HI>Thamars</HI> sake, where∣of nothing but the name is onely reserued. Fourthly, the Castle of <HI>Emaus,</HI> in which our Sauiour was knowne after his resurrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Emaus, or Ni∣copoli.</HI></NOTE> by the two Disciples, in breaking of bread. Fifthly, the valley of <HI>Gibeon,</HI> where the Sun stood at the voyce of <HI>Ioshua,</HI> from his naturall course, <HI>Ioshua</HI> 10 12. Sixthly, the Toombe of <HI>Samuel,</HI> ouer the which <HI>Moores</HI> haue a <HI>Moskee</HI> erected.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Turkish Church.</HI></NOTE> Seuenthly, the Toombes of the va∣liant Captaine <HI>Iudas Macchabeus,</HI> and his children, where∣upon are now onely the ruines of an old Chappell. And last of all, the buriall place of the Noble Family of the Kings and Quéenes of <HI>Israel,</HI> or <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> The entry whereof was so straight, that on our backes we behoued to slide downe, aboue ten paces vnder the ground, with light Candles in our hands. In that spacious place wee saw 24 Chambers hewen out of a marble rocke. Each roome hath a hanging stone doore of a great thicknesse, so artificially done by the skilfull Art of Masons, that the rarest spirit of 10000 cannot know how these doores haue béene made, so to moue as they do, being afirme rocke both below and a∣boue; and the doores haue neither yron nor timber worke about them: but by cunning are made so to turne, and in that same place where they grew they are squared; yea, and so exquisitely done, that the most curious Carpenter can∣not ioyne a péece of boord so neatly, as these stone doores ioyne with the Rocke. In each of these roomes are two Sepulchres, wherein I saw the bones of some of these dead Princes.</P>
<P>Tuesday the tenth day of my being at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> we issu∣ed forth of the Citie early, with our aforesaid Guides, ri∣ding Westward: The first remarkeable thing wee saw, was the place (as they say) where the Crosse grew, where∣on Christ suffered; being reserued by <HI>Greekes,</HI> who haue a <HI>Couent</HI> builded ouer it. That Crosse is said to haue béene of foure sundry kindes of wood, and not of one Trée, for they shewed vs but one hole wherein it grew, and so they hold it
<PB N="108" REF="58"/>
to haue béene all of one péece of Oliue trée; but this I sus∣pend, leauing it to be searched by the pregnancy of riper iudgements then mine. About fiue miles further, we arri∣ued at a village on the mountaine of <HI>Iudea</HI>; where wee saw a dis-inhabited house, in which <HI>Elizabeth</HI> the mother of S. <HI>Iohn Baptist</HI> dwelt when <HI>Mary</HI> came vp from <HI>Galile</HI> to sa∣lute her; and néere to this we beheld (as they say) the San∣ctuary wherein <HI>Zacharias</HI> was stricken dumbe till <HI>Eliza∣beth</HI> was deliuered. Two miles further, on a rocky moun∣taine, we arriued at a caue, wherein (say they) S. <HI>Iohn</HI> did his penance till he was 19 yeares of age, after which time he went downe to dwell at <HI>Iordan:</HI> It is a pretty fine place hewen out of a rock, to the which we mounted by 12 steps, hauing a window cut through of a great thicknesse of firme stone, whence we had the faire prospect of a fruitfull valley: and from the mouth of this delectable <HI>Grotto</HI> gushed forth a most delicious fountaine.</P>
<P>Returning thence, wee passed ouer an excéeding high Mountaine, from whence we saw the most part of <HI>Iudea</HI>; and to the Westward in the way of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Castle of the <HI>Prophet Elisha.</HI> Descending on the South side of the same Hill, we arriued at <HI>Philips</HI> fountaine, in which he bap∣tized the Eunuch of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> standing full in the way of <HI>Gaza.</HI> Here we paid some certaine <HI>Madins</HI> vnto the <HI>Moores</HI> of the village, so did wee also for the sight of euery speciall Monument in <HI>Iudea.</HI></P>
<P>At night we lodged in <HI>Bethleem</HI> in a Monastery of the same <HI>Franciscans</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> after supper we went all of vs (hauing Candles) to the place where our Sauiour was borne; ouer the which there is a magnificent Church buil∣ded: But before wee came where the Crubbe had béene, wee passed certaine difficile wayes; where (being arri∣ued) we saw no Monument thereof, saue onely they did demonstrate the place, which is adorned with Marble, Saphyre, and Alabaster Stones. Not farre from that they shewed vs the place ouer the which the starre stayed, that conducted the thrée Wisemen from the East. From thence
<PB N="109" REF="58"/>
they brought vs to a Caue without the Towne, wherein (say they) the Uirgine <HI>Mary</HI> was hid, when <HI>Herod</HI> perse∣cuted the Babes life (from which also being warned by the Angell) Shee, and <HI>Ioseph,</HI> fled downe into <HI>Egypt</HI> with the Childe.</P>
<P>The earth of this Caue is white as snow, and hath this miraculous operation, that a little of it drunke in any li∣quor, to a woman that after her childe-birth is barren of milke, shall foorthwith giue aboundance: which is not onely aualieable to Christians, but also Turkish, Moorish, and Arabianish women, who will come from far Coun∣tries, to fetch of this earth. I haue séene the nature of this dust practised, wherefore I may boldly affirme it, to haue the force of a strange vertue.</P>
<P>Wednesday following, wee hired foure and twenty <HI>Moores,</HI> to conduct vs vnto <HI>Salomons</HI> fish ponds, which are onely thrée, being neuer a whit decayed; And to <HI>Fons Segnatus,</HI> whence commeth the water in a stone Conduit, along the Mountaines that serueth <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which worke was done by <HI>Salomon.</HI> Returning thence, and kéeping our way Southward, we passed through the Ualley of <HI>He∣bron,</HI> where <HI>Iacob</HI> dwelt,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob were interred at Hebron.</HI></NOTE> and entred into the fields of <HI>Sy∣chem</HI>; where <HI>Iacobs</HI> sonnes kept their fathers sheepe: and not farre hence, they shewed vs a dry pit, which they cal∣led <HI>Iosephs</HI> pit, that was at <HI>Dothan,</HI> wherein hee was put by his brethren, before they sold him to the <HI>Ismaelites.</HI> In our backe comming to <HI>Bethleem,</HI> we saw a Caue in the De∣sart of <HI>Ziph,</HI> wherein <HI>Dauid</HI> hid himselfe, when hee was persecuted by King <HI>Saul,</HI> and the field <HI>Adra,</HI> where the Angels brought the glad tydings of saluation vnto the Shepeheards.</P>
<P><HI>Bethleem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bethleem.</HI></NOTE> is the pleasantest Uillage in all <HI>Iudea,</HI> situa∣ted on a pretty hill, and fiue <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> It produceth commodiously, an infinite number of Oliue, and Figge-trees, some Cornes, and a kind of white wine, wherewith wee were furnished all the time of our abode there; also in, and about <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> In our way as we came
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>
backe to the Citie, the <HI>Viccario</HI> shewed vs a little <HI>Moskee,</HI> kept by <HI>Turkes,</HI> in which (said he) was the Toombe of <HI>Ra∣chell, Iacobs</HI> wife, who dyed in that place, as she was tra∣uelling from <HI>Padan-Aram,</HI> with her husband <HI>Iacob.</HI> The foundation also of a house, where <HI>Habacuck</HI> the Prophet dwelt; a Trée growing yet by the way side, vnder the which (say they) the Uirgin <HI>Mary</HI> was wont to repose her her selfe in trauelling. Wee saw also a naturall rocke in the high way, whereon (say they) <HI>Elias</HI> oft slept, and is not ashamed to say, that the hollow dimples of the stone, was onely made by the impression of his body: as though the tender flesh of man could leaue the print of his portraiture on a hard stone. And not farre from this, they shewed vs the place, where the Starre appeared to the Wise-men, af∣ter they had left <HI>Herod,</HI> to seeke for the Sauiour of man∣kind. Approaching Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> wee saw a quadrangled dry pond, wherein (say they) <HI>Beershaba</HI> the wife of <HI>Vrias,</HI> was washing, when <HI>Dauid</HI> looked forth at his window, and was bewitched by her beauty. Ouer against this place, on the North side of <HI>Gehinnon,</HI> we saw the ruines of a Pa∣lace wherein <HI>Dauid</HI> dwelt, which hath béene one of the an∣gles of the ancient Citie, and standeth at the diuision of the valley <HI>Ennon,</HI> which compassed (as a ditch) the North part of Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> euen to the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> being now filled vp with fragments of old walles, and the valley of <HI>Gehinnon</HI> lying West, and East, bordering along the south side of <HI>Sion,</HI> til it ioyne also with the valley of <HI>Iehosa∣phat,</HI> which inuironeth the East, and deualling parts of <HI>Ie∣rusalem.</HI> Néere to this demolished Tower, wee sawe the habitation of <HI>Simeon,</HI> who hauing seene the blessed <HI>Messias,</HI> said: <HI>Now Lord let thy seruant depart in peace, for mine eyes haue seene thy saluation.</HI></P>
<P>Aprill 25. and the twelfth day of my abode there, early on Thursday morning, the <HI>Guardiano,</HI> twelue Friers, and <HI>Iohn Baptista</HI> (because that was the last day of seeing any more Monuments, or was to bee seene there) accompanied vs: as wee issued at the South gate of the Citie, we came
<PB N="111" REF="59"/>
to a place, on the skirt of <HI>Sion,</HI> where (say they) <HI>Peter</HI> af∣ter his denyall of Christ, wept bitterly.</P>
<P>Descending by the side of that same Hill, we crossed the valley <HI>Gehinnon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acaldema.</HI></NOTE> and came to <HI>Acaldema,</HI> the Potters field, or field of bloud, which is a little foure-squared roome, three parts whereof are inuironed with a naturall rocke, and the fourth square bordering with the valley, is made vp of stone worke: The top is couered, and hath thrée holes, where-through they let the dead Christians fall downe; for it is a buriall place of Pilgrimes to this day. As I looked downe, I beheld a great number of dead corpes, some whereof had white winding sheetes, &amp; newly dead, lying one aboue another in a lumpe, yeelded a pesti∣lent smell, by reason they were not couered with earth, saue onely the architecture of a high vault, which maketh, that in a long time the corpes cannot putrifie and rot.</P>
<P>Neere vnto this <HI>Campo,</HI> wee entred into a darke Caue, where (say they) the Apostles hid themselues, when Christ was taken. At the foote of the same Ualley, wee came to <HI>Ponto Nehemia,</HI> in which place the <HI>Iewes</HI> did hide the holy fire, when they were taken captiues to <HI>Babylon</HI>; walking more downe-ward, toward the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> wee saw a darke cellar vnder the ground without windowes, wherein (said the <HI>Guardian</HI>) the Idolatrous <HI>Iewes</HI> made a sacrifice of their children vnto a brasen Image called <HI>Mo∣loch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Idoll Mo∣loch.</HI></NOTE> which being made hote, they inclosed them in the hol∣lownesse thereof, and so slew them: and least their crying should haue moued any compassion towards them, they made a thundring noyse with drummes, and other instru∣ments, whereupon the place was called <HI>Tophet,</HI> mentioned in <HI>Ier.</HI> 7.31. Hence wee came to the <HI>Poole</HI> of <HI>Siloam;</HI> in which we washed our selues, the water whereof falleth downe through a Rocke, from the Citie aboue, running strait to the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> and there we saw also the remnants of that sacked Tower of <HI>Siloam.</HI> Neere to this we saw a Fountaine, where (say they) the Uirgin <HI>Mary</HI> vsed often to wash the Babes cloathes and linnen clowts.
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>
From thence we crossed the Brooke <HI>Cedron</HI> (which of old ran through the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> but now is dry) and came to the Toombes of <HI>Absolom</HI> and <HI>Zacharias,</HI> and the Caue wherein S. <HI>Iames</HI> was wont to hide himselfe from the persecuting <HI>Iewes.</HI> Ascending more vpward on the hill, in the way of <HI>Bythania,</HI> we saw these places; where <HI>Iudas</HI> hanged himselfe, the withered fig-trée grew, and the house of <HI>Simon</HI> the Leper.</P>
<P>Arriuing at <HI>Bythania,</HI> we saw a Castle and Toombe of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> on whom Christ shewed a miracle, in raising him from the graue, after hee had béene foure daies dead: Not farre thence in the same Uillage, we saw the decaied house where <HI>Martha,</HI> and <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> inhabited, and the stone whereon Christ sate (say they) when hee said to <HI>Martha, Mary hath chosen the better part.</HI> Returning thence, wée left <HI>Bethphage</HI> on our left hand, and about mid-day, arri∣ued on the top of Mount <HI>Oliuet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mount Oliuet.</HI></NOTE> where we dined, and pro∣céeded in our sights. From this place we had the full pros∣spect of <HI>Ierusalem:</HI> For the Citie standing vpon the edge of a hill, cannot bee seene all at one sight, saue on this Mountaine which is thrée times higher then Mount <HI>Sion.</HI> These are the Monuments shewen vs vpon the Mount of <HI>Oliues:</HI> First, the print of the left foote of our Sauiour, in an immoueable stone, which he made, when hee ascen∣ded to heauen; The <HI>Guardiano</HI> told vs further, that the right footes print was taken away by <HI>Turkes,</HI> and detained by them in the Temple of <HI>Salomon;</HI> But who can thinke our Sauiour trode so hard at his Ascension, as to haue left the impression of his feet behind him. Next the place where hee foretold the iudgement to come, and the signes, and the wonders, should bee séene in the heauens before that dread∣full day. Thirdly, the place where the <HI>Symbolum Aposto∣lorum</HI> was made, which is a fine chamber vnder the ground, like a Church, hauing twelue pillars to support it. Fourthly, where Christ taught his Disciples the <HI>Pater noster,</HI> and where hee fell in an agony, when hee sweate bloud and water. Fiftly, where <HI>Peter, Iames,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="60"/>
slept, whiles our Sauiour prayed, and returned so oft to awake them, and also below that, where the other Disci∣ples were left. Sixthly, the Garden of <HI>Gethsemane,</HI> where Christ vsed commonly to pray, in the which place he was apprehended by the officers of the high Priests, and was also where <HI>Iudas</HI> kissed him, and the Sergants fell back∣ward on the ground. Seuenthly, they shewed vs a stone marked with the head, feete, asd elbowes of Iesus, in their throwing of him downe, when as they bound him, after he was taken, aad euer since (say they) haue these prints re∣mained there. And lastly, at the foote of Mount <HI>Oliuet,</HI> in the valley of <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> we descended by a paire of staires of 43 steps, and 6 paces large, in a faire Church builded vnder the ground, where (say they) the monument of the assumption of the virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is, whom they thinke was borne in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> dwelt at <HI>Bethleem</HI> and <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and died vpon Mount <HI>Sion.</HI> I saw also there, the Sepulchres of <HI>Ioseph</HI> her husband, <HI>Ioachim</HI> her father, and of <HI>Anna</HI> her mother. The valley of <HI>Iehosaphat</HI> is two miles of length, lying South and North.</P>
<P>Lo, I haue plainely described, the whole Monuments I saw within, and about <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> by the order of these 12 seuerall daies: the like heretofore, was neuer by any Pil∣grime, so liuely manifested. But as I said in the beginning of my description, so say I now also at the conclusion; some of these things are ridiculous, some of manifest vntruths, some also doubtfull, and others somewhat more credible, and of apparant truth. The recapitulation whereof, is one∣ly by me vsed, as I was informed by <HI>Gaudentius Say∣bantus</HI> the <HI>Padre Guardiano, Laurenzo Antonio il Vicca∣rio,</HI> and the Trouchman <HI>Iohn Baptista.</HI></P>
<P>After this wandring vp and downe <HI>Iudea,</HI> I stayed in <HI>Ierusalem</HI> thrée daies, both reposing my selfe, and also pre∣paring my necessaries for a new voyage; being determined to go downe to <HI>Egypt,</HI> with a Carauan of <HI>Grand Cayro.</HI> In the last night of my staying at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which was at the holy Graue, I remembring that bounden duty, and louing

zeale, which I owe vnto my natiue Prince, whom I in all humility (next and immediate to Christ Iesus) acknow∣ledge, to be the supreme Head, and Gouernour, of the true Christian and Catholique Church; by the remembrance of this obligation I say, I caused one <HI>Elias Bethleete,</HI> a Chri∣stian inhabitour of <HI>Bethleem,</HI> to ingraue on the flesh of my right arme, <HI>The Neuer-conquered Crowne of Scot∣land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Crownes of the two Kingdomes, and the great Armes of Ie∣rusalem, are to bee seene in∣grauen on his right arme.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>the now Inconquerable Crowne of England,</HI> ioyned also to it; with this inscription, painefully carued in letters, within the circle of the Crowne, <HI>Viuat Iacobus Rex.</HI> For the which the old Frier was mightily disconten∣ted, and railed vpon me, that I should (as he said) haue en∣dured so much paine for such an Arch-enemy of the <HI>Ro∣mane Church</HI>; but he not knowing how to mend himselfe, in the end I quenched and abated his calumnies, by a reci∣tation of the incomparable vertues of our dread Soue∣raigne, who for his bounty, wisedome, learning and go∣uernment, was not equaled, nor paragonized amongst all the Princes of the earth: which he déepely conceiuing, was stricken in admiration, and began to intreat me (if I liued) to returne to my natiue Soile, that I would make it knowne vnto his Maiesty, the great tribulation and op∣pression they sustained vnder Infidels, to preserue the me∣mory of these Monuments, especially of the holy Graue; for the maintaining whereof (said he) that great Monarch gaue neuer any allowance, nor supported the poore afflicted Christians at <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> which indeed, I promised to doe, and also performed his request: For after my first arriuall in <HI>England,</HI> most humbly did I report it to his Highnesse, in the priuy Garden of <HI>Greenewich</HI>; who indeed gaue me a most gracious and compassionable answere, saying: <HI>They neuer sought any help of him, and if they had, hee would haue supported their necessity.</HI></P>
<P>Aprill 29. and the 16. day of my staying there, I, and other ten <HI>Frankes,</HI> made couenant with the Carauan of 900 persons, bound for <HI>Egypt,</HI> for ninetéene <HI>Piasters,</HI> the man to furnish vs w<SUP>t</SUP> Camels, or Dromidories to ride on, &amp; to exo∣ner
<PB N="115" REF="61"/>
vs of all <HI>Caffars</HI> and tributes, in our voyage to <HI>Cayro:</HI> By which condition we had the aduantage of two commo∣dities: first, it freed vs from the wrongs and extortions of sauage Rascals by y<SUP>e</SUP> way: Next, we preuented all cosening and deceitfull dealing that might from the Captaine haue procéeded, whose fidelity in him, or such like, is seldom suffi∣ciently to strangers approued.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this iourney greatly was I anima∣ted with the company of these <HI>Franke</HI> Pilgrimes, which I found in <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> but alas! no sooner was their society déere and acceptable to me, but as soone by death, was I robd of all the ten, such was the will of the Almighty: some whereof dyed in the Desarts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The death of ten Pilgrimes.</HI></NOTE> and the rest in <HI>Grand Cayro,</HI> leauing mee, euen as I was before, a solitary wanderer amongst rauenous Wolues, the particular rehearsing of which, would but aggrauate my sorrow, and renew the re∣membrance of my by-past melancholy. Not that I stood in néed of any help, to stir vp the alacrity of my mind, which of it selfe was innated by nature, and fortified in maturity, by propagating diuers aspiring, and alacrious conceits; but my excessiue griefe was, because they daily pretended my good, whereby I was infinitely obliged to their kind, and vndeserued courtesies. For where such proffer of loue re∣maineth in the disponers, it bréedeth alwaies in the recei∣uers a kind of dutifull obligation; and as it was in some ho∣nourable fashion extended towards me, so the remembring of it, shall adde a greater grace, and reputation to streng∣then the memory of their vntimely death. Neither will I relie so much vpon my owne worthinesse, as to thinke that benefite of the procrastination of my life, was by any me∣rite of mine deserued; but that God so much the more might shew his incomprehensible greatnesse, by that deli∣uerance in my naturall imbecility. For all the beginnings of man are deriued from God, whose ends are either per∣fected or disanulled by his determination: and nothing we possesse is properly our owne, or gotten by our owne power, but giuen vs onely through his munificence. And
<PB N="116" REF="62"/>
all the spaces of earth, which our feete tread ouer, the light we enioy, and the excellent faculties we are indued withall; or what we can do, say, or thinke, is onely raised, guided, and distributed by Gods impenetrable counsell, will, and prouidence; which although the pride of our wicked na∣ture, doth not yeeld the true attribution thereunto, yet the powerfull working of the counsell of God is such, that in it selfe, it proueth an eternall wisedome, and confoundeth the foolishnesse of the world.</P>
<P>Betwéene <HI>Gaza</HI> in <HI>Palestina,</HI> and <HI>Saleak</HI> on the frontiers of <HI>Gozan,</HI> I had no sight of any remarkeable obiect: for in all that six daies iourney, we trauelled still in the night, to shun the intollerable heat of the Sun by day; wherefore it with-held from our eyes, the visible shew of sandy and bar∣ren desarts, whiles our bodies felt the painefull fruite of that mountainous ground, in the silent night: yet not so silent, but we saw often a concurrance of naked <HI>Arabs,</HI> partly liuing in haire-cloth tents,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arabs.</HI></NOTE> and partly in holes and Caues, who gaue vs diuers assaults, and sometimes inter∣cepted our forward going, notwithstanding of that refuge we had of the Castles in that waste wildernesse, which are maintained by the Soldan of <HI>Egypt,</HI> for the succour of Trauellours.</P>
<P>At <HI>Saleak</HI> we encountred with a great company, and 1200 Camels and Dromidores, which were laden with the wares of <HI>Damascus,</HI> and going to <HI>Cayro.</HI> A Dromidore, and Camell, differ much in quality, but not in quantity, being of one height, bredth, and length; saue onely their heads, and feet, which are proportionated alike, and the difference of quality is such, that the Dromidorie hath a hard-reaching trot, and will ride aboue sixty miles in the day, if that his Rider can endure the paine. But the Camell is of the contrary disposition: for he hath a most slow and lazy pace, remouing the one foote from the other, as though he were weighing his feete in a ballance; neyther can he go faster, although he would: But he is a great deale more tractable then the other; for when
<PB N="117" REF="62"/>
his maister loadeth him, hee falleth downe on his knées to the ground, and then riseth againe with his burthen, which will be a maruellous great weight.</P>
<P>The red sea, which we left to the Westward of vs, is not red, as many suppose, but is the very colour of other seas: The reason for which it hath béene called <HI>Mare rubrum,</HI> is onely because of the bankes, rushes, sands, and bushes that grow by the shore side, which are naturally red. Some o∣thers haue called it so, in respect of the brookes which <HI>Moses</HI> turned to red bloud, who mis-construing the true sense, took seas for riuers.</P>
<P>Arriuing at <HI>Cayro,</HI> I lodged in the house of a <HI>French</HI> Consull, and on the second day, I went with two <HI>French</HI> Merchants, to view the thrée <HI>Pyramides,</HI> surnamed, <HI>The Worlds Wonders</HI>; which are distant from <HI>Grand Cayro,</HI> a∣bout foure leagues, standing néere to the bankes of <HI>Nylus.</HI> In proportion they are quadrangled, growing smaller and smaller towards the top, and builded with great and large stones, the most part whereof are fiue foot broad, and nine foot long. All the Historians that euer wrot of these won∣ders, haue not so amply recited their admirable greatnesse, as the experience of the beholder may testifie their excessiue hugenesse and height. The first we approched vnto, is big∣gest, whose height amounteth to (according to the compu∣tation of our Dragoman) 1092 foote. And at the bottome euery square of the foure faces is of bredth 450 foote. Ha∣uing outwardly mounted by degrées, with great paine to the top, I was maruellously rauished to sée such a square plat-forme, all of one péece of stone, which couereth the head; each side wherof extendeth to 17 foot of my measure. It is yet a great maruell to me, by what engine they could bring it vp so safe to such a height. Truely, the more I be∣held this strange worke, the more I was stricken in admi∣ration: for before we ascended, the top of this <HI>Pyramide</HI> did séeme so sharpe as a pointed Diamond; but when we were mounted thereon, we found it so large, that in my opinion, it would haue contained a hundred men. The middle <HI>Pyra∣mide</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>
did looke a farre off somewhat higher then the other two: but when we came to the roote thereof, we found it not so: for the stone-worke is a great deale lower, but the aduancement of the height is only because of a high ground wheron it standeth. It is of the same fashion of the first, but hath no degrées to ascend vpon: neither hath the third <HI>Py∣ramide</HI> any at all; being by antiquity of time, all worne and demolished, yet an admirable worke, to behold such great masses, and (as it were) erected mountaines all of fine marble. The reason why they were first founded, is by many ancient Authors so diuersly coniectured, that I will not meddle therewith.</P>
<P>Betwéene the biggest <HI>Pyramide</HI> and <HI>Nylus,</HI> I saw a <HI>Co∣losse,</HI> or head of an Idoll, of a wonderfull greatnesse; being all of one marble stone, erected on a round rocke: It is of height (not reckoning the Columns) aboue 815 foote, and of circuit 68. <HI>Pliny</HI> gaue it the name <HI>Sphingo,</HI> and repor∣ted much more of the bignesse, largenesse, and length of it. But howsoeuer he erred in his description, yet I resolue my selfe it is of so great a quantity, that the like thereof (being one intire péece) the world affoordeth not; and may be reckoned amongst the rarest wonders. Some say, that anciently it was an Oracle, the which so soone as the Sun arose, would giue an answere to the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> of any thing by them demanded.</P>
<P>In our way as we returned, our Dragoman shewed vs (on the banke of <HI>Nylus</HI>) where a <HI>Crocodile</HI> was killed by the ingenious policie of a <HI>Venetian</HI> Marchant, being licen∣tiated by the <HI>Soldan.</HI> The match whereof for bignesse and length, was neuer seene in that riuer, whose body was 22 foote, and in compasse of the shoulders 8 foot. This cruell beast had deuoured aboue 46 men and women, besides o∣ther creatures: and in his belly were found more then 60 rings of gold and siluer, which the miserable bodies had worne in their noses, through their cheeks and vnder lips: for such is the custome of the people to weare their iewels. And if the baser sort cannot attaine to such like, then they
<PB N="119" REF="63"/>
counterfeit their betters with rings of brasse and lead, wea∣ring also on their armes and ankles, broade bands of Iron continually.</P>
<P>The garden wherein the onely and true <HI>Balsamo</HI> grow∣eth, is inclosed with a high wall, and daily guarded by <HI>Turkes,</HI> who hardly will suffer any Christian to enter with∣in, much lesse the <HI>Iewes:</HI> for not long agoe they were the cause, that almost this Balme was brought to confusion. The tree it selfe is but of three foot height, which keepeth euermore the coloor greene, hauing a broad thrée poynted leafe, and twice in the yeare it being incised, yeeldeth a red water, which is the naturall <HI>Balsamo.</HI> Not farre hence, there is a place caled <HI>Mommeis,</HI> lying in a sandy desart, where are innumerable Caues cut forth of a rock, wherunto the corps of the most men in <HI>Cayro,</HI> are carried and interred, which dead bodies remaine alwayes vnputrified, neither yeeld they any stinking smell.</P>
<P><HI>Grand Cayro</HI> is an admirable great Citie, and larger of bounds then <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but not so populous, neither so wel builded: It was of old caled <HI>Memphis,</HI> &amp; was the fur∣thest place that <HI>Vlysses</HI> in his trauels visited, so well memo∣rized by <HI>Homer;</HI> yet a voyage now of no such estimation, as that Princely Poet accounted it: for his trauels are not comparable to some of these dayes wherein we liue: It is situate in a pleasant plaine, and in the heart of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> be∣ing distant from <HI>Nylus</HI> about an <HI>English</HI> mile. It was cal∣led <HI>Cayro Babylonia:</HI> for there are two <HI>Babylons,</HI> one in <HI>Assyria,</HI> which by the <HI>Turks</HI> is called <HI>Bagdat:</HI> and the other is this, which ioyneth with <HI>Cayro nouo.</HI> The circuit of new <HI>Cayre</HI> is about 22 miles, not speaking of <HI>Cayre de Ba∣bylon, Medin, Boulak,</HI> &amp; the great Towne of <HI>Caraffar,</HI> being as Sub-vrbs, &amp; of many smals maketh vp a little world, y<SUP>e</SUP> length whereof in all is thought to be 28 miles, &amp; of bredth 14. The principal gates are these, <HI>Babeh Mamstek,</HI> which is toward the Wildernesse of the red sea: <HI>Bebzavillah,</HI> toward <HI>Nylus,</HI> and <HI>Babell Eutuch,</HI> toward the fields. The stréetes are narrow, being all of them almost couered, and the
<PB N="120" REF="64"/>
foundation of their buildings is raised vpon two Stages height, to kéepe the people from the parching heate. The <HI>Bazar,</HI> or exchange beginneth at the gate of <HI>Mamstek,</HI> and endeth at a place called <HI>Babesh.</HI> At the corners of chiefe pla∣ces there are horses to be hired, that for a small matter, a man may ride where so he will, to view this spacious spred Citie, and change as many horses as he listeth, hauing the maisters which owe them, to conuoy them.</P>
<P>There is a great commerce here with all Nations vnder the heauens: For by their concurring thither, it is won∣derfully peopled with infinite numbers. Such a multitude, and the extreme heate, is the cause why the pest is euermore in it; insomuch, that at some certaine times 10000 persons haue dyed thereof in one day.</P>
<P>In this Towne you shall euer finde all these sorts of Christians, <HI>Italians, French, Greekes, Almaines, Georgi∣ans, Aethiopians, Iacobines, Armenians, Syrians, Nestori∣ans, Amaronites, Nicolaitans, Abessenes, Nubians, Slauo∣nians, Gofties, Ragusans,</HI> and some captiue <HI>Hungarians,</HI> the number of which is euer thought to bee beyond an hun∣dred thousand people; besides all other sorts of Infidels, as <HI>Turkes,</HI> blacke and white <HI>Moores, Musilmans, Persians, Tartars, Indians, Iewes, Arabians, Barbarres</HI> and <HI>Sarazens.</HI> From the Castle wherein the <HI>Soldan</HI> habitateth, (which is builded on a pretty hill) you haue the prospect of the whole Citie, the Gardens, and Uillages bordering on <HI>Nylus,</HI> and of the most part of the plaine, and fertile places of <HI>Egypt,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aegypt</HI> bordereth with <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and the Desarts of <HI>Libia,</HI> on the South: on the North, with the sea <HI>Medirer∣rene:</HI> the chiefest ports whereof, are <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and <HI>Damietta:</HI> Toward the <HI>Occident</HI> with the great lake of <HI>Bouchiarah,</HI> and a dangerous Wildernesse confining therewith; so full of wilde and venemous beasts, which maketh the West part vnaccessable: On the East, with a part of the red Sea, and desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> through which the people of <HI>Israel</HI> passed. In all the land of Egypt, which
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>
is a great kingdome, there is no Well or Fountaine, saue onely the riuer <HI>Nylus,</HI> neither doe the inhabitants know what raine is, because they neuer sée any.</P>
<P>This floud irriguateth all the low Plaines of the land once in the yeare; which inundation beginneth vsually in Iuly, and continueth to the end of August, which furni∣sheth with water all the Inhabiters.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The nature of Nylus.</HI></NOTE> There is a dry Pond called <HI>Machash,</HI> in the midst whereof standeth a Pillar of eightéene brasses height, being equall with the profundity of the ditch, whereby they know his increasing, and if in the yeare following they shall haue plenty or scarsity of things. For when the water beginneth to flow aboue the ordinary course, it falleth downe incontinently in this place, where it ariseth euery day vpon the pillar, sometimes a spanne, a foote, or two foote. At the time of his inun∣ding, there are certaine people appointed to watch the li∣mites of his growth; For when the water wareth to fif∣téene brasses, it is a signe that the next yeare shall bee fertile: If if amounteth but to twelue, that yeare shall be indifferent; and it surpasse not nine brasses, it presageth a great dearth and famine; and if it shall happen to flow to the top, all the countrey of Egypt is in danger to bee de∣stroyed.</P>
<P>From <HI>Nylus</HI> are many ditches drawne along to the scat∣tered villages in the plaines, the water whereof entring in these narrow channels, the people haue cisternes made of purpose, wherein they receiue it, and conserue the same till the next inundation. At which time also they make great feastings, and rare solemnities, dauncing, eating, drink∣ing, singing, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uking of drummes, sounding of trumpets, and other oftentations of ioy. There are infinite vene∣mous creatures bred in this riuer, as Crococodiles, Scor∣pions▪ vgly mis-shapen wormes, and other monstrous things, which annoy oft the inhabitants, and also those who tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck on the water.

This Kingdome produceth no Wines, neither is garnished with Uine-yards; but that which strangers doe make vse of, are brought from <HI>Candy, Cy∣prus,</HI> and <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Cayro</HI> I stayed seuen dayes, and embarked at <HI>Boul∣lacque</HI> in a Boate: and as I went downe the Riuer, I saw these Townes, <HI>Salomona, Pharsone, Foua,</HI> an <HI>Abdan:</HI> In these parts there is a stone called <HI>Aquiline,</HI> which hath the vertue to deliuer a Woman from her paine in Childe∣birth. In all this way, the greatest pleasure I had, was to behold the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re beautie of certaine Birds, called by the <HI>Turkes, Elloc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;</HI> whose Feathers being beautified with the diuersitie of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rest colours, yéeld a farre off to the behol∣der, a delectable shew: hauing also this property, the née∣rer a man approcheth them, the more they loose the beau∣tie of their Feathers, by reason of the feare they conceiue when they sée any man. Upon the fourth day I landed at <HI>Rosetta,</HI> and came ouer land with a company of <HI>Turkes</HI> to <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE><HI>Alexandria</HI> is the second Port in all Turkie: It was of old a most renowned Citie, and was built by <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, but now is greatly decayed, as may appeare by the huge ruines therein: It hath two Hauens, the one where∣of is strongly fortified with two Castles, which defend both it selfe, and also <HI>Porto vechio</HI>: The fieldes about the Towne are sandy, which ingender an infectious aire, espe∣cially in the moneth of August, and is the reason why stran∣gers fall into bloudy fluxes, and other heauy sicknesses. In my staying here, I was aduised by a Christian Consull, to keepe my stomacke hot, to abstaine from eating of fruit, and
<PB N="123" REF="66"/>
to liue soberly with a temperate diet. The rule of which go∣uernement I stroue diligently to obserue: so did I also in all my trauels, prosecute the like course of a small dyet, and was often too small against my will; by the meanes where∣of (praised be God) I fell neuer sicke till my returne into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Twelue dayes abode I in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and on the thir∣téenth I embarked in a ship belonging to <HI>Ragusa,</HI> in which I was kindly vsed, and Christian like entertained. The windes somewhat at the beginning fauouring vs, wee weighed anchors, and set forward to Sea. In the time of our nauigation, there died seuentéene of our Mariners and Passengers, which bred no small griefe and feare to the rest; being cast ouer-boord in a boundlesse graue to féede the fi∣shes. Fiue sundry times were we assailed by <HI>Cursaires,</HI> of <HI>Tunneis, Argeire,</HI> and <HI>Biserta</HI>; yet neuer captiuated, or sea∣zed vpon: such was the pleasure of God, and the resolute minds of the <HI>Ragusans,</HI> which are a kinde of martiall peo∣ple. Fifty daies were we crossed with contrary winds, tack∣ling and boording; in all this time we saw no land. And as <HI>Ouid</HI> said in the like case, <HI>Nil nisi pontus, &amp; aer.</HI> Our fresh water being spent, we were constrained to beare into the Ile of <HI>Malta,</HI> where hauing giuen ground to the ankers; I dis-barked and bade farewell to the Captaine and shippes company.</P>

<P><HI>Sycilia</HI> hath bene famous in all former Ages, for by <HI>Dio∣dorus Siculus</HI> it was cognominated, the paragon of Iles: by <HI>Titus Liuius,</HI> the Garden of <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Greekes</HI> haue ce∣lebrated much commendation to this Ile.
