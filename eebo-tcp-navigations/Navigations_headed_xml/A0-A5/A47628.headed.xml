<HEAD>The Epistle DEDICATORY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To his deservedly Honoured Friend <HI>Francis Willughbie,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>SIr, Since I have had the happiness to be known to you, (my Habitation being not far distant from yours) I have found so much Candour and Civility in you, that I thought I needed not to seek further for a person, to whom I should dedicate this little Tract of Travel and Coyns, you having Travelled into the most famous Coun∣tries
<PB REF="3"/>of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Firth</HI> in his Sts. Monu∣ment, re∣ports of my Lord <HI>Willughbies</HI> eldest Son, that he had seen <HI>Rome,</HI> though he was not at all tainted with her errours: he brought over many of the rarities of other Nations, but none of their sins.</NOTE> and (being inquisitive after all Curiosi∣ties) also improved your tra∣vel both to the acquiring and knowledge of Coyns, and ma∣ny other rarities, some of which you were pleased for∣merly to shew me and others, and have (for the better com∣pleting of this Treatise) com∣municated to me several Ob∣servations, about Forein coyns especially. I would our Gen∣try generally were more stu∣dious, and would spend their time as profitably as you and
<PB REF="3"/>some others do. That would confirm what Mr. <HI>Burton</HI> in his Melancholly
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Part 1. Sect. 2. Subsect. 15.</NOTE> observes of some of our <HI>English</HI> Gentry, that they are excellently well learned, like those <HI>Fuggeri</HI> in <HI>Germany, Du Bartas, Du∣plessis, Sadael</HI> in <HI>France, Pi∣cus Mirandula, Scottus, Ba∣rottus</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> There is an Honourable Gentleman
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Robert Boye <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></NOTE> now of the Royal Society, (whereof you are likewise a worthy Member) who hath Travelled abroad to good purpose, and by his Philosophical
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Experi∣menta Fructi fera &amp; Luci. fera.</NOTE> Expe∣riments and other useful Trea∣tises, hath much honoured the Nation. I may here relate, what I have heard from a very
<PB REF="4"/>worthy Divine; that he never knew a Family, wherein the Men and Women both, were of so obliging a Carriage, and of such great abilities. There is also a learned Knight and Baronet
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Nor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Knatch∣ball.</HI></NOTE> of this Parliament (mentioned among the Bene∣factors to the <HI>Polyglott Bible</HI>) who hath written Critical notes in Latine on the New Testament. I shall onely adde this, that it may seem strange for me to publish a Discourse of Money, who (when I had the honour to be a Member of the House of Commons) was alwaies silent when that Sub∣ject came into debate,</P>

<HEAD>TO THE Candid READER.</HEAD>
<P>REader, It is said of <HI>Ulysses, Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, &amp; urbes, Horat. De Arte Poetica.</HI> Yet I would not have thee read my Discourse of Travel, <HI>Peregrinante animo.</HI> The Commodity which comes to humane Societies, by the Tra∣vells of prudent, pious, and well governed persons, is very great. The Apostles, the Dis∣ciples of Christ, and also their Disciples, and many others, have gon through a great part
<PB REF="5"/>of the World to convert the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> So if a Voyage be un∣dertaken to know the rites and customes of several places, and the forms of Cities, as the <HI>Ro∣man Decemviri</HI> were sent to <HI>Greece,</HI> that they might know the Laws of that Countrey, and especially <HI>Solons. Pythagoras, Plato, Apollonius</HI> did go into divers Countries to increase their knowledge. <HI>Diodorus Si∣culus</HI> &amp; <HI>Strabo</HI> Travelled into several parts of the World, that they might be acquainted with the History and Scituation of those places. <HI>Pausanias</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He hath written that excel∣lent book of the Monuments and Antiquities of <HI>Greece,</HI> remaining in his time.</NOTE> <HI>com∣passed Greece, Arrianus,</HI> the
<PB REF="5"/><HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> and <HI>Cluverius</HI> Travelled into many Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> that they might more exactly describe those parts. The knowledge of Lan∣guages hath incited many to Travel; <HI>Vossius</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">De <HI>Orig.</HI> &amp; <HI>Prog. Idololat.</HI> l. <HI>3.</HI> c. <HI>37.</HI></NOTE> instanceth in <HI>Jacobus Golius</HI> (that famous <HI>Arabist</HI>) who not satisfied with the instruction of <HI>Thomas Er∣pinus</HI> in the Arabick <HI>Lan∣guage,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Aethio∣picis ope∣ram im∣pendebat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uam.</HI> D. M. <HI>Wanslebius, qui ad perpoliendum ejus in iis∣dem ingenium, in varias orientis oras longa atque periculo∣sa suscepit Itinera.</HI> D. Cast. <HI>Praelat. ad Lexic. Heptaglot.</HI> Christianus Rarius Clenard, <HI>and</HI> Warner, <HI>travelled ar for the same purpose. Dr.</HI> Casaubon <HI>of</HI> Credulity <HI>and</HI> Incredulity. <HI>part 1. saith, that</HI> Jo. Ernestus Burgravius <HI>professeth to have travelled the greatest part of</HI> Europe <HI>to satisfie his Cu∣riosity.</HI> Erasmus <HI>in his</HI> Colloquia <HI>entitles one of them</HI> Pe∣regrinatio Religionis ergo.</NOTE> went first into <HI>Mouri∣tania,</HI> and being chosen Succes∣sor to <HI>Erpenius</HI> in his place af∣ter
<PB REF="6"/>his death, he took a long Voyage into <HI>Syria,</HI> and there staid till he had perfected his skill in that Language. I may very well here mention, our worthy professor of the <HI>He∣brew</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongues in <HI>Oxford, Dr. Edward Pocock,</HI> who was long abroad at <HI>Alep∣po,</HI> and other places on the same account. Where he so de∣meaned himself, that he was very much respected by the Na∣tives, and chosen for an Ʋmpire amongst them, to compremise such differences as fell out there. The learned works he hath published, give ample Testimony of the skil he attain∣ed in the Arabick, especially by
<PB REF="6"/>that long Voyage. The Jesuits themselves and others write much, how industrious the Je∣suits were in the propagation of the Christian Faith, and how they have sown the seed of sa∣ving truth in <HI>China</HI> or else∣where.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> in the <HI>2d.</HI> part of his last Book of Christiani∣ty, <HI>c. 14. p. 488.</HI> saith, The at∣tempts of the Jesuits in <HI>Congo, Japon</HI> and <HI>China</HI> were a very noble work, and so were the <HI>Portugal</HI> Kings encourage∣ments: but two things spoiled their success.</P>
<P>First, That when they took down the Heathens Images, they set them up others in their
<PB REF="7"/>stead; and made them think that the main difference was, but whose Image they should worship.</P>
<P>Secondly, But especially, that they made them see, that while they pretended to promote Re∣ligion, and to save their souls, they came to promote their own wealth, or the Popes Domini∣on, and to bring their Kings under a Forein power.</P>
<P>The honest attempts of Mr. <HI>Eliots</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> is much more agreeable to the A∣postles way,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Videsis Voretii Disputat. Select. Theol. partem fe∣cundum De Genti∣lismo</HI> pag. <HI>650.</HI></NOTE> and maketh more serious spiritual Christians.</P>
<P><HI>Justus Heurnius</HI> (son to <HI>John Heurnius</HI> the learned Physician) left the study of
<PB REF="7"/>Physick, and wholly gave him∣self to the study of Divinity, that thereby he might be the better inabled to promote the Conversion of the Indians, and taking an Evangelical Em∣bassie to the Indies, he there abode above <HI>14</HI> Years, preach∣ing to the Indians in their Mo∣ther Tongue, Catechising them, and admonishing them pri∣vately, and by his singular in∣nocensie,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He hath published a Book (which I have seen)</HI> De Lega∣tione E∣vangelic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ad Indos capessenda.</NOTE> humility and mode∣sty, and daily fervent devotion, and great charity to the poor; He endeavoured to propagate the Kingdome hf Christ among them.</P>

<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> made use of their kind of measure called <HI>Parasanga,</HI>

<P>See of it in Mr. <HI>Greaves</HI> his Epistle to Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> before his Discourse of the <HI>Roman Foot</HI> and <HI>Denarius.

<P>Among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> for measuring, the <HI>Perch</HI> was in use, as in these times in <HI>Europe,</HI> among the <HI>Egyp∣tians, Arabians</HI> and <HI>Persians,</HI> the <HI>Para∣sanga</HI> and <HI>Schoenus,</HI> Among the <HI>He∣brews</HI> the <HI>Kane</HI> or <HI>Reed, Angelo Crator.</HI></P>

<P>Now a days the name of Mile is most used by the <HI>Italians, Germans, Danes, Norweigians, Sweeds, English, Scots.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Keckerman</HI> in the book and chapter before quoted, saith, a mile is either proper, containing a 1000 paces, which being alwaies used in <HI>Italy,</HI> is called <HI>Ita∣lian,</HI> or improper, either a league or a <HI>German</HI> mile: A league (saith he) is either old, that is, a proper mile and a half, or new, (which they call a <HI>French</HI> mile) two proper miles. Four <HI>German</HI> mile is either common 4000 paces, or great, 5 thousand paces.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French</HI> met out their distance of places by <HI>Leagues,

From <HI>Spain</HI> to <HI>Hi∣spaniola</HI> is a 1200 leagues.</P>
<P>The <HI>Russians</HI> or <HI>Muscovites</HI> reckon their distances of places by a certain
<PB N="85" REF="51"/>space which they in their native tongue call <HI>Vorest.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Purchas</HI> in his <HI>Pilgrims</HI> speaks of the <HI>Cose</HI> among the <HI>Chinois</HI> and <HI>East-Indians.</HI> The <HI>Course</HI> or <HI>Cose,</HI> saith he, is a mile and a half, somtimes two miles; most <HI>English</HI> Mathematicians accord with the <HI>Italians,</HI> and reckon 60 miles to a degree. The <HI>Gothick</HI> and <HI>Sweedish</HI> mile is 5 or 6 <HI>Italian</HI> miles, somtimes 8. The Common <HI>English</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">An <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> mile containeth 5280 foot.</NOTE> mile makes one and a half <HI>Ita∣lian; Villamont</HI> saith, that a <HI>French</HI> league contains two <HI>Italian</HI> miles.</P>
<P>The common <HI>German</HI> mile being for the most part in plain makes more then 3 <HI>English</HI> or 5 <HI>Italian</HI> miles; but in some places the solitude and the ascent of mountains make the miles of <HI>Germany</HI> seem much longer; one Dutch mile and a half makes a mile of <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The miles of <HI>Switzerland</HI> being over conti∣nual mountains are so long, as the pas∣sengers distinguish their Journy more by the spaces of hours, then by the distances or numbers of miles. The miles of <HI>Bohe∣mia</HI> and <HI>Moravia</HI> are no less tedious, and though the length of the <HI>Switzers</HI> and <HI>Bohemian</HI> miles may in part be attribu∣ted to the climbing of the mountains and
<PB N="86" REF="52"/>bad way, yet no such reason can be gi∣ven for the miles of <HI>Moravia,</HI> which countrey is either a plane, or full of little pleasant Hills, and the ways fair, and the Country well inhabited.</P>
<P>The <HI>Low-Country</HI> miles are of a mid∣dle length between the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>French</HI> miles, among which the miles of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Freezeland</HI> are longer than the rest.</P>
<P>The mile of <HI>Denmark</HI> is somewhat longer then 3 <HI>English</HI> miles, and answer∣eth to the common <HI>German</HI> mile.</P>
<P>The miles of <HI>Poland</HI> generally are like the miles of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> at this day have no distin∣ction of their ways by miles, nor days by hours.
